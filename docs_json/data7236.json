Metallic pipelines and structural items are being \n\nprogressively replaced by engineering plastics and composite materials \n\nwith high structural efficiency and corrosion resistance. As these \n\ncomponents require regular inspection and maintenance routines, \n\ndeveloping non-destructive inspection techniques is required. The high \n\ncost associated with conducting maintenance in hazardous and difficult \n\nto access areas, along with the prevalence of premature failure of \n\nadhesive bonded joints between composite material pipes, creates a \n\ndemand for passive long-term monitoring techniques able to act as a \n\nbridge between scheduled inspections. This work explores the use of \n\nfiber optic sensors integrated into the bonded joints as a potential long-\n\nterm solution. Several optical fiber sensors were studied and one was \n\nselected for testing purposes. Sensors were then integrated internally and \n\nexternally to bonded joints between pipes with similar geometry to those \n\nused in oil and gas rigs. A series of non-destructive tests plus a \n\ndestructive test were realized. Shearography and computed tomography, \n\nas supporting techniques, corroborate the capacity of the selected \n\nsensors and devised sensing strategy to detect the presence of voids and \n\ndebondings at various stages of the pipeline\u2019s life cycle. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Composite materials, adhesive bonded joints, fiber optic \n\nsensors, non-destructive testing, structural health monitoring. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nO mar, a atmosfera salina, a incid\u00eancia solar e a presen\u00e7a de \n\nfluidos corrosivos fazem de plataformas de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s \n\nambientes hostis para a infraestrutura nelas instalada.

O que levou \u00e0 adapta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde t\u00e9cnicas como a termografia, holografia, shearografia, \n\nultrassonografia e tomografia para a inspe\u00e7\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sitos. \n\nAinda, o alto custo associado \u00e0 realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de ensaios em \u00e1reas \n\nclassificadas e de dif\u00edcil acesso, conjuntamente com a preval\u00eancia de \n\nfalhas prematuras em uni\u00f5es adesivadas em tubula\u00e7\u00f5es de material \n\ncomposto, criam uma demanda por t\u00e9cnicas passivas de monitoramento \n\na longo prazo capazes de atuar como uma ponte entre as inspe\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nperi\u00f3dicas. \n\nA uni\u00e3o por adesivo \u00e9 um processo testado, confi\u00e1vel e \n\nconsolidado para unir substratos met\u00e1licos, pl\u00e1sticos, cer\u00e2micos e \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos.

Alguns sensores capazes de medir m\u00faltiplos \n\npar\u00e2metros tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o apresentados. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPara a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de ensaios, sensores de fibra \u00f3ptica foram \n\nintegrados interna e externamente a uni\u00f5es adesivadas de tubula\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas similares \u00e0s utilizadas em campo. Um total de doze fibras \n\nsensoras, contendo 3 redes de Bragg cada foram colocadas internamente \n\n\u00e0 camada de adesivo das uni\u00f5es para medir o campo de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\naxial no interior da uni\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, fibras mais longas contendo 12 \n\nredes de Bragg foram projetadas para serem enroladas externamente ao \n\nlongo da circunfer\u00eancia das uni\u00f5es. \n\n Uma s\u00e9rie de ensaios n\u00e3o-destrutivos foram realizados, \n\ncome\u00e7ando-se por testes de inser\u00e7\u00e3o dos sensores. Tr\u00eas uni\u00f5es \n\nadesivadas foram instrumentadas, incluindo uma com defeitos \n\nplanejados para fins de compara\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPor fim um dos corpos de prova foi ensaiado de maneira n\u00e3o-\n\ndestrutiva para avaliar se a instrumenta\u00e7\u00e3o integrada possui impacto \n\nnegativo nas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas das uni\u00f5es. O corpo de prova \n\nensaiado falhou em uma regi\u00e3o distante da instrumentada, mas mais \n\ntestes precisam ser realizados para que se estabele\u00e7a signific\u00e2ncia \n\nestat\u00edstica de que a instrumenta\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi delet\u00e9ria. \n\n Shearografia digital e tomografia computadorizada foram \nutilizadas como t\u00e9cnicas de apoio e corroboraram a capacidade dos \n\nsensores selecionados e da estrat\u00e9gia de medi\u00e7\u00e3o adotada para a \n\ndetec\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a de vazios e falhas de ades\u00e3o em v\u00e1rias etapas do \n\nciclo de vida das uni\u00f5es. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Materiais comp\u00f3sitos, uni\u00f5es adesivadas, sensores de \n\nfibra \u00f3ptica, ensaios n\u00e3o-destrutivos, monitoramento de integridade \n\nestrutural. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\nFigure 2-1 - Automotive CCB disc.

system components are frequently \n\nor constantly in contact with corrosive fluids or atmosphere, such as in \n\nthe oil and gas industry, usage of composite materials in the form of full \n\ncomposite-made components and composite fabric reinforcements has \n\ngrown exponentially, due to low weight-to-strength ratio and high \n\ncorrosion resistance inherent to these materials. \n\nMetallic produced water pipelines on offshore oil platform are \n\nbeing systematically replaced by adhesive bonded fiber reinforced \n\nplastic (FRP) pipelines for their lower weight and high corrosion \n\nresistance, generating a demand for FRP inspection techniques. \n\nThis lead to heavy investment in adapting and developing \n\ninspection techniques to ensure the quality and structural integrity of \n\ncomposite components. Several NDT techniques have been adapted or \n\ndeveloped on the last decades to meet this demand, including \n\nthermography, ultrasonography, radiography, holography and \n\nshearography. \n\nExperience acquired over the years at the Metrology and \n\nAutomation Laboratory (LABMETRO) in the Federal University of \n\nSanta Catarina shows that today, in the oil and gas industry, inspection \n\nof composite materials is not optimally conducted.  \n\nAccess to the inspection site and to the component to be inspect is \n\noften difficult, as is the case of pipelines that are buried or installed in \n\nconfined spaces on oil platforms. Available technology requires \n\nexperienced personal to interpret measurement results, leading to higher \n\ninspection costs. Logistical and financial constraints result in inspection \n\nschedules that are seldom enough to guarantee premature failure will not \n\noccur. \n\nA promising new approach is to embed several fiber optic sensors \n\ninto the adhesive layer of the FRP pipes bonded joints for long-term \n\nstrain monitoring. In order to expand the coverage of NDT techniques \n\non composite pipelines, this study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of \n\nthis new health monitoring approach.  \n\nIn addition to adhesive bonded joints between FRP pipes, it is \n\nexpected that this method can also be used for health monitoring of anti-\n\ncorrosion FRP reinforcements and FRP repairs applied to metallic \n\npipelines. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\n1.2.1 General Objective \n\nThe main objective of this work is to study, propose and evaluate \n\na health monitoring solution for adhesive bonded joints between pipes \n\nutilizing embedded fiber optic sensors. \n\n1.2.2 Specific Objectives \n\nSpecific objectives can be seen as the stepping-stones, or a set of \n\nrequirements, that paves the road towards the fulfillment of the general \n\nobjective. They can be listed as follows: \n\n \n\n? Select a set of fiber optic sensors to be embedded or \notherwise integrated to the adhesive bonded joint; \n\n? Determine sensor placement aiming for a balance \nbetween intrusiveness and coverage; \n\n? Evaluate the capacity of the devised approach to detect \nand monitor commonly occurring defects; \n\n? Define procedures and elaborate recommendations to \nconduct tests on adhesive bonded joints between pipes \n\nwith integrated fiber optic sensors. \n\n \n\nTo properly address all listed objectives a series of adhesive \n\nbonded joints with integrated instrumentation is to be designed and \n\nconstructed. Tomography and shearography will be used as support \n\ntechniques to better understand collected fiber optics sensors data. \n\n1.3 Chapter Summary \n\nThis work is structured in six chapters. Chapter two contains a \n\nbrief review on composite materials. The definition of a composite \n\nmaterial is presented, along with several application examples in the oil \n\nand gas industry. Some aspects of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) pipes \n\nsuch as fabrication, adhesive bonded joints between pipe sections and \n\ncommonly occurring defects are detailed. \n\nChapter three consists of a review on optical fibers and optical \n\nfiber sensors. The reader will come across fiber optics fundamentals and \n\na selection of both single-point and distributed optical fiber sensors \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\ncapable of single or multi-parameter measurements. Emphasis is given \n\nto Fiber Bragg Gratings, as they are the sensor of choice in this work. \n\nChapter four discusses the methodology behind the experiments \n\nconducted during this work. Experimental procedures, test sample \n\ndesign, instrumentation design and placement plans are detailed. \n\nChapter five presents discussions based on the data obtained \n\nduring the execution of the experiments detailed in the previous chapter. \n\nSensor embedding procedure is the first discussion point, followed by \n\ndetection of defects in the adhesive layer and the effects of the \n\nembedded instrumentation on the bonded joint\u2019s strength. \n\nChapter six contains the conclusions to this work. First the \n\nobjectives presented on chapter one are compared to the results from \n\nchapter five to check their completion, then a series of recommendations \n\nfor the continuation and expansion of this work is presented. The \n\ncapabilities and limitations of the proposed health monitoring method \n\nare discussed as well \n\n1.4 Test Specimen Material \n\nThis work originally intended to use fiberglass-epoxy composite \n\npipes as test specimens. Due to time and money constraints, industrial \n\ngrade CPVC pipes were used instead. The review on composite \n\nmaterials and piping systems has been kept as a reference for future \n\nworks. Since this study uses relative strain measurements, it is not \n\nexpected that the change in materials will influence the evaluation of the \n\nproposed method. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n2 COMPOSITE MATERIALS \n\nComposite is a generic denomination used to describe a \n\ncomposition material whose resulting properties differ significantly \n\nfrom those of its individual components.  It is obtained by combining \n\ntwo or more constituent materials with distinct physical or chemical \n\nproperties. [1][2] \n\nDifferently from an alloy, in which the mixing of constituents \n\noccurs at atomic scale, mixing occur at macroscopic level in composites \n\nand so materials remain separated in the final product. [1] \n\nThe use of composites is increasing in various engineering \n\napplications due to their inherent characteristics. High strength to weight \n\nratio, high resistance to corrosion, oxidation and to harsh chemicals such \n\nas solvents, grease and oil are all examples of desirable properties. [3] \n\n2.1 Basic Concepts \n\nIn general, one of the constituent materials in a composite form a \n\ncontinuous phase called matrix and the other constituents are \n\nreinforcements, in the form of fibers or particulates, added in to improve \n\nthe matrix properties. Sandwich panels and laminates do not follow this \n\nstructure but are still composites by definition. [4][5] \n\nFibers can be made of light elements like carbon or boron, silica \n\ncompounds such as silicon oxide, silicon carbide and silicon nitride. \n\nOrganic materials (C-H-N chains) such as aramid (Kevlar) are also \n\ncommonly used. [4][5] \n\nFiber reinforcement represents the major contribution to the \n\ncomposite final toughness, strength and stiffness in fiber directions. \n\nFibers can be weaved into several different fabric styles, from plain \n\nweave to satin weave, according to the desired directional properties and \n\nlay-up conformability. [4][5] \n\nParticle reinforcement is cheaper and allow for more flexibility in \n\nthe production and forming of the composite. Gains in stiffness, strength \n\nand toughness are lower comparatively to fibers, but increase in \n\nhardness and abrasion resistance is unmatched. [6] \nMatrixes may be composed of polymer, metal or ceramic \n\nmaterials. It forms the shape of the component, transfers load in and out \n\nof the reinforcements, protect fibers from environmental harm and from \n\ndamage from nearby fiber failure. [4] \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nTemperature and environmental resistance, longitudinal \n\ncompression strength, transverse tensile strength and shear strength are \n\nproperties of the composite that are matrix-dominated. [4] \n\n2.2 Miscellaneous Applications \n\nThe following short list of applications clearly illustrates the \n\nversatility of composite materials. \n\n2.2.1 Composite Brakes  \n\nCarbon-composite (CCM) and carbon-ceramic (CCB) discs have \n\nbeen used since 1980 in motorsports braking systems. CCM discs are \n\nmade of high performance ceramic matrix composites reinforced with \n\ncarbon fibers. CCB discs (Figure 2-1) follow the same basic structure \n\nbut with an added ceramic friction layer on both braking surfaces. [7] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-1 - Automotive CCB disc. [8] \n\n2.2.2 Cemented Carbides \n\nCemented carbides are metal matrix composites reinforced with \n\ncarbide particles. Usually tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC) \n\nand tantalum carbide (TaC). [9][10] \n\nOriginally developed for use in tungsten filament drawing for \n\nincandescent lamps, cemented carbides were quickly adopted in a \n\nnumber of applications for its unique combination of hardness, wear \n\nresistance and high temperature strength. It is often used on \n\nmetalworking rollers cutting tools and inserts for metal cutting (Figure \n\n2-2). [9][11][12] \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-2 - Cemented carbide cutting inserts. [13] \n\n2.2.3 Sandwich Panels \n\nAlthough they do not follow the classic monolithic structure, \n\nsandwich panels are also composites by definition. A sandwich panel is \n\ncomposed of a core inserted between two flat plates or laminates. The \n\ncore increases the moment of inertia of the panel with little impact on its \n\nmass, leading to structures that are highly efficient under axial \n\ncompression and bending. [14][15] \n\nSandwich panels are used in applications that require very high \n\nstrength-to-weight ratios, such as aircrafts (Figure 2-3), racing cars, \n\nmarine vehicles, prefabricated houses and optical breadboards.

Adapted from [16]. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n2.3 Composite Materials in the Oil and Gas Industry \n\nIn the oil and gas industry, FRPs are more commonly used in the \n\nform of composite pipelines (Figure 2-4), localized patch repairs and \n\nanticorrosive patches applied to metallic pipelines, storage tanks (Figure \n\n2-5) and tanker ships. [17][18][19] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-4 \u2013 Fiberglass-epoxy pipes for marine and offshore applications. [20] \n\n \n\nOil platform and tankers benefit greatly on FRP\u2019s light weight, \n\nwhile their inherent corrosion resistance leads to longer lifespan for \n\ncomponents in contact with oil, gas, maritime atmosphere and produced \n\nwater.  \n\n \nFigure 2-5 \u2013 Fiberglass-epoxy anticorrosive patch applied to the bottom of an \n\noil storage tank. [17] \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nOther applications include structural items, composite risers, and \n\nvarious sorts of pressure vessels. [21][22][23][24] \n\nFiberglass-epoxy pipes are the most commonly used FRP pipes in \n\noil platforms, especially in produced water lines. \n\n2.4 Fabrication of FRP Pipes and Fittings \n\n2.4.1 Glass Fibers Production Process \n\nFigure 2-6 shows a schematic representation of glass fibers \n\nmanufacturing process. Sand, aluminum and borax (sodium borate) are \n\nmixed together and continuously fed to a furnace that heats the mixture \n\nto 1250 \u00baC. Molten glass flows through a perforated platinum plate and \n\nis then drawn to the right diameter. The fibers are cooled with water \n\nsprays and directed to a treadmill or cylinder to be coated with a \n\nprotective layer that allows posterior handling. Finally, individual \n\nfilaments are united into strands, typically in groups of 204 filaments, \n\nwhich are wound and stored.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-6 \u2013 Schematic representation of a glass fiber production line. Adapted \n\nfrom [1].  \n\n2.4.2 Filament Winding \n\nFilament winding is a composite materials production process \n\nthat is greatly suited for axisymmetric components such as pipes and \n\nmost fittings. Multi-axis machines are also available for components that \n\nare more complex. [4][24][25] \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nContinuous strands or filaments of fibers are bathed in resin \n\nbefore being led to a rotating mandrel, where they are laid down at high \n\nspeed, as illustrated in Figure 2-7. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-7 - Schematic diagram of filament winding. [25] \n\n \n\nFibers can be laid down with high precision in predefined paths \n\nby adjusting the angular velocity of the mandrel and the movement \n\npattern of a moving platform, as shown in Figure 2-8. [4][24][25] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-8 - Winding pattern control scheme. [26] \n\n \n\nCommon patterns are polar, hoop or helical (Figure 2-9). \n\nWinding angle, fiber tension and the amount of resin in each layer are \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nthe main control parameters to ensure the desired stiffness and strength \n\nare obtained. [4][24][25] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-9 - From right to left: Polar, helical and hoop winding. Adapted from \n\n[25]. \n\n \n\nAfter winding, the composite coated mandrel is removed and \n\ntransported to an oven, if heat curing is needed, or a clean room for \n\nroom temperature curing. The mandrel can be removed and reused or \n\nremain as part of the composite after the curing process ends. \n\n[4][24][25] \n\n2.5 Adhesive Bonded Joints \n\nAdhesive bonding is a method for joining metals, plastics, \n\nceramics and composites in which an adhesive, placed between the \n\nsurfaces to be joined, solidifies to consolidate the union. [27] \n\nIn comparison to classical mechanical joining methods, such as \n\nscrewed or riveted joints, it presents a series of advantages. Bonded \n\njoints are lighter, cheaper and are more resistant to damage. Fewer parts \n\nare required to complete the joining process, there is no need to drill the \n\nadherends and loads are distributed over larger areas. They are more \n\nflexible and inhibit crack propagation on the adhesive layer, leading to a \n\nlonger fatigue life. [27][28][29] \n\nNonetheless, they are difficult to inspect with non-destructive \n\nmethods and all surfaces in contact with the adhesive must be carefully \n\ncleaned and prepared beforehand. Mechanical properties may change \n\ndue to moisture absorption and service temperature is limited by both \n\nthe adhesive and curing cycle parameters. Since it is difficult to \n\ndisassemble adhesive bonded joints without incurring in irreparable \n\ndamage this is often considered a permanent joining method. [29] \nSpecialized literature contains plenty of examples of adhesive \n\njoints suitable for all kinds of mechanical loads. Some of these \n\nconfigurations are shown in Figure 2-10. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-10 - Several types of adhesive bonded joints. Adapted from [28]. \n\n2.5.1 The Bell-and-Spigot Joint \n\nThe bell-and-spigot joint is an asymmetric junction where a \n\nsmooth walled bell is sized to accept either a smooth or gasketed pipe \n\nspigot. Examples of this type of joint are depicted in Figure 2-11. It is \n\nwidely used to join cast iron and ferroalloy pipes, vitrified clay pipes \n\nand plain, reinforced or asbestos cement pipes. It is also the most used \n\nmethod for joining plastic pipes. [30][31] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-11 - Bonded and gasketed bell-and-spigot joint. Adapted from [32]. \n\n \n\nSealing method varies according to the pipe material and the \n\noperating pressure in the line. Rubber O-rings, gaskets and mortar with \nsealing rings are adequate for liquid lines pressurized up to  \n\n1.5 MPa (15 bar) and 0.1 MPa (1 bar) for gases. For higher operating \n\npressures, welded cast iron pipes or adhesive bonded composite pipes \n\nmust be used. [30][31] \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nIn adhesive bonded joints, the bell\u2019s inner surface and the spigot\u2019s \n\nouter surface can be cylindrical or conical (tapered).  \n\n2.5.2 Tubular Single Lap Joint \n\nFrom Figure 2-11 it is evident that when both surfaces are not \n\ntapered, the bell-and-spigot joint is very similar to a tubular single lap \n\njoint (Figure 2-12), which is simpler and has been a subject of study to \n\nresearchers in recent years. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-12 - Tubular single lap bonded joint. Adapted from [33] \n\n \n\nThe behavior of tubular single lap bonded joints in FRP pipes to \n\naxial, pressure and torsional loads have been studied analytically, by \n\nfinite elements method, and experimentally. [33][34][35][36][37] \n\nDas and Pradhan [33] show that the state of stress in the bonded \n\njoint is fully tridimensional, due to the free edges, differential elasticity \n\nand coupling between rotation, stretching and bending. \n\nAlthough studies performed by Das [33] and Oh [36][37] \n\nproposed consistent failure conditions for interfacial failure and \n\nadhesive failure, the mathematical equations often require the input of \n\nall three principal strains or up to six stress components. \n\n2.6 Quality Control and Non-Destructive Inspection \n\nWhen compared to metals, composites are more susceptible to \n\ndamage and introduction of defects upon manufacturing and handling. \n\nIn FRPs, defects are usually introduced during manufacturing, mainly \n\ndue to wrong number of composite plies, wrong curing temperature, \n\npoor resin choice, foreign-body inclusions or poorly sealed vacuum \n\nbags. [16][38] \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nWhen inspecting adhesive bonded joints between FRPs, the most \n\ncommon defects are delamination and debonding. These defects have \n\nvarious causes, such as trapped air, catalyst mixed in excess to the resin, \n\npropagation of cracks through the FRP\u2019s matrix and lack of adhesive. \n\nCommonly occurring defects, their description and most likely \n\ncauses are summarized in [16][17][18]. \n \n\nTable 2-1 - Commonly occurring defects and their likely cause. [17][18] \n\nDefect Description Likely Cause \n\nDelamination Separation between \n\nlayers of a laminate. \n\nPoor compatibility between \n\nconstituent materials, excess \n\nuse of catalyzer. \n\nDebonding Separation between \n\ncomponents/interfaces \n\nthat should be bonded. \n\nPoor compatibility between \n\nconstituent materials, poor \n\ncontrol over manufacturing. \n\nInclusions Presence of foreign \n\nobjects inside the \n\nmaterial. \n\nImproper cleaning of the \n\nglued surfaces, contaminated \n\nresin or plies. \n\nPorosity Presence of numerous \n\nvisible pores. \n\nAir trapped in resin, \n\ninclusion of volatile \n\nsubstances. \n\nChipping Small broken pieces of \n\nthe components in the \n\nvicinity. \n\nBad handling, impact. \n\nFiber breakage Presence of ruptured \n\nfibers. \n\nOverload, impact. \n\nSwelling Dimensional changes. Moisture absorption. \n\nElongation Axial dimensional \n\nchange \n\nOverload. \n\nFracture Component rupture. Overload. \n\n \n\nNDT techniques are preventive tools for diagnosing component \n\nmalfunction, deterioration and failure. Data acquisition for assessing \n\nstructural integrity is conducted in a non-invasive way. [39] \n\nDespite the existence of a relatively large number of techniques, \n\nonly a few are suitable for inspecting composites due to their \n\ncharacteristic anisotropy. In addition to visual inspection, the most used \n\nNDT techniques for composite are holography [39], radiography [40] \n\nultrasonography [41], thermography [42], shearography [43] and \n\ncomputed tomography [44].  \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nShearography and computed tomography are complimentary \n\nanalysis techniques used in this work. \n\n2.6.1 Computed Tomography \n\nComputed tomography (CT) is an extension of computed \n\nradiography. Both techniques make use of differential absorption of  \n\nX-rays by local variations in a material\u2019s density, thickness and/or \n\ncomposition. Both use electronic X-ray detectors, outputting digital \n\nimages by default. [44][45][46] \n\nThe difference between the two is that CT latter allows a full \n\nthree-dimensional reconstruction of an object and its internal structure \n\nby combining multiple radiographic images taken from different angles. \n\nThis can be achieved in two ways: by rotating the object (Figure 2-13) \n\nor by rotating the X-ray source and detector around the object. \n\n[44][45][46] \n\nIn FRPs, tomography allows the detection of impact damage, \n\ncrushed core (Figure 2-14) and other internal defects such as \n\ndelamination, porosity and cracks. [44][45][46] \n\nIn this work, CT is used to check the position of embedded \n\nsensors and artificially inserted defects in bonded joints of test \n\nspecimens. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-13 \u2013 CT scan with rotating turntable.

[46] \n\n2.6.2 Digital Shearography \n\nShearography is a quasi-common-path laser interferometry \n\ntechnique capable of contactless measurement of strain fields. Being a \n\nquasi-common-path interferometry technique allows the use of short \n\ncoherence length illumination and leads to reduced sensibility to \n\nenvironmental disturbances. This makes shearography a robust \n\ntechnique for use in the industry and in the field. [47][48] \n\nThe name of this technique comes from its use of speckle pattern \n\nshearing interferometry. Laser speckle phenomenon (Figure 2-15) \n\nmanifests from the interferometric superposition of coherent light \n\nscattered by a diffusely reflecting surface. [47] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-15 - Laser speckle pattern. [49] \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nShearography measurement requires the superposition of two \n\nimages from the illuminated surface with a slight shear between them. \n\nShearing interferometers are used to simultaneously split and shear the \n\nreflect wavefront. Lateral shearing interferometers (Figure 2-16) are the \n\nmost common, but is also possible to use radial, rotational and reverse \n\nshear interferometers. [43][47] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-16 - Modified Michelson interferometer for lateral shearing \n\ninterferometry. Adapted from [43]. \n\n \n\nThe superposition of the slightly sheared images creates a speckle \n\ninterferogram, which has an intensity distribution directly related to the \n\nsurface\u2019s geometry. When the studied object (Figure 2-17) is subjected \n\nto a loading, its surface geometry changes and so does the intensity \n\ndistribution (Figure 2-18) of the speckle interferogram.

[50] \n\n \n\nBy capturing a series of speckle interferograms, it is possible to \n\nextract phase information from the intensity maps (Figure 2-19). \n\n[43][47] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-19 - Phase map extracted from a series of intensity maps. [50] \n\n \n\nSubtracting a phase map obtained before applying a load from a \nphase map obtained after a load is applied results in a fringe map \n\n(Figure 2-20). The fringe map is related to the change in the surface\u2019s \n\nstrain field in response to the applied load.

Areas delimited by dots exhibit anomalies caused \n\nby sub-surface defects. [51] \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nIn this work, shearography is used to study the effects of the \n\nembedded sensors and artificial defects in the strain fields on the surface \n\nof the adhesive bonded joints of the test specimens. \n\n2.7 Structural Health Monitoring \n\nSHM in composite can be performed in many ways, including \n\nconventional sensors such as electric strain gages [52], or modern \n\nmethods [53] using different types of sensors and transducers embedded \n\nin the composite. \n\nInfluence of embedded sensors on the mechanical properties of \n\ncomposite components is a controversial topic. Some studies observe up \n\nto 70% reductions in yield strength, 20% reduction in the modulus of \n\nelasticity and up to 10% reduction of the performance under tensile load, \n\ndepending on the orientation of the sensors in relation to the fibers in \n\ncomposite laminates [54]. Other studies show mixed results on the \n\ninfluence depending on size and type of sensor and the constructive \n\naspects of the tested composite [54][55][56][57]. There has also been \n\nreports of minimal or no negative effects [58].  \n\nDespite the mechanical degradation discussion, this approach has \n\nshown very promising results in several applications, such as detection \n\nand monitoring of debonding in adhesive bonded joints [59], monitoring \n\nof strain gradient in adhesive composite joints [60] and life cycle \n\nmonitoring of curved composite parts.

They are small: the typical fiber sensor has an uncoated \ndiameter of 125 \u00b5m and around double this value for \n\ncoated fibers. Their small frame allows the embedding of \n\nsensors into delicate composite structures with minimal \n\nimpact on mechanical properties. \n\n \n\nii. With proper choice of coating and connectors fiber sensors \ncan be made environmentally rugged, being able to \n\nwithstand the bonded joints fabrication and off-shore \n\nenvironments. \n\n \n\niii. They are passive sensors: not needing electrical power \nmakes them safe to use in classified environments. \n\n \n\niv. High multiplexing capabilities means simpler and less \nbulky setups. Off-shore oil and gas rigs usually have a \n\ngreat number of pipelines grouped in tight spaces. \n\n3.1 Optical Fibers \n\nTelecommunications have been revolutionized by fiber optic \n\ntechnology as mass production techniques and technical improvements \n\nled to superior performance and reduced costs. Now a sensing \n\nrevolution is on the making, as engineers combine product outgrowths \n\nof fiber optic telecom with optoelectronic devices. [63] \n\nNovel fiber sensors, with the potential of replacing many of the \n\nexisting environmental sensors and fulfilling roles where current sensor \n\ntechnology falters, are quickly being researched and developed. [63] \n\nAn optical fiber is a dielectric waveguide capable of transmitting \noptical signals over great distances with attenuation as low as 0.2 dB/km \n\n[64]. The typical structure of an optical fiber is shown in Figure 3-1.  \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-1 - Typical structure of a silica optical fiber. Adapted from [65]. \n\n \n\nThe core is the waveguide itself, a solid glass rod that traps and \n\nconducts light by total internal reflection. It is usually made of high \n\npurity silicon dioxide (SiO2). Plastic fibers are also widely used. [65] \n\nA cladding is not strictly required for transmitting light, but it \n\nreduces dispersion loss due to discontinuities on the core\u2019s surface, \n\nprovides mechanical protection and prevents contaminants absorption \n\ninto the core. Notice that the index of refraction ?2 of the cladding is \ngreater than the index of refraction ?1 of the core. [65] \n\nMost fibers are coated with a plastic, ceramic or metallic buffer. \n\nBuffer coatings provide extra mechanical protection by isolating the \n\nfiber from small irregularities on adjacent surfaces, which would \n\notherwise induce microbending loss. It also protects the fiber from \n\nscratches and abrasion. [65] \n\nAny light wave coupled into the fiber is heavily attenuated if it \n\nrefracts into the cladding instead of bouncing back by total internal \n\nreflection. Light rays entering the core of a fiber with uniform index of \n\nrefraction ?1, from a medium with index of refraction ? &lt;?1, are \ntransmitted forward as long as they belong to the acceptance cone \n\ndepicted in Figure 3-2. [65] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-2 - Acceptance cone in an optical fiber with uniform core index of \n\nrefraction. Adapted from [65]. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nFrom Snell\u2019s law, total internal reflection will occur for an \n\nincidence angle ? that satisfies the condition presented in Equation 3.1. \n[65] \n\n ???(?) ?\n?2\n\n?1?      \n (3.1) \n\nWorking backwards from this it is easy to show that the \n\nmaximum value for ?0 can be determined by applying Equation 3.2. \n[65] \n\n ? ???(?0,???) = ??1\n2 ? ?2\n\n2   ? ?1?2?   (3.2) \n\nEquation 3.2 also defines the numerical aperture ?? for an \noptical fiber with a uniform index of refraction at its core. The \n\nparameter ? is the core-cladding index difference, as defined by \nEquation 3.3. [65] \n\n ? = 1 ? (\n?2\n\n?1? ) \n (3.3) \n\n The approximation on the right side of Equation 3.2 is valid \n\nwhen ? ? 1. Typically, for a given value of ?1, ?2 is chosen such that ? \nis equal to 0.01. [65] \n\n3.1.2 Fiber Types \n\nLooking at Figure 3-2 from a ray optics perspective, it is evident \n\nthat light entering the fiber with many different angles ?0 &lt;?0,??? can \nbe guided. However, the number of guided modes is finite. Solving \n\nMaxwell\u2019s equation for a circular dielectric waveguide shows that only \n\ncertain modes entering the fiber with ?0 &lt;?0,??? are guided. [63] \nFibers can be classified according to the number of allowed \n\nmodes and the index of refraction profile in the core region. Figure 3-3 \n\npresents a comparison between conventional optical fiber types. \n\nAs the name suggests, multimode fibers allow a large number of \n\nguided modes simultaneously. A multimode step-index fiber usually \n\nallows around 104 individual propagation modes. The number of guided \n\nmodes, or modal volume, ? can be approximated by Equation 3.4 for \nlarge ? values. [63][65] \n\n  ? = ?\u00b2 2\n?   (3.4) \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-3 \u2013 Fiber types by number of guided modes and index of refraction \n\nprofile. Adapted from [65]. \n\n \n\nWhere ? is the normalized frequency, as defined by Equation \n(3.5), for a light wave of wavelength ? traveling in a fiber of core radius \n?. [65] \n\n ? = (\n2??\n\n?\n) ??1\n\n2 ? ?2\n2 = (\n\n2??\n\n?\n) ??   (3.5) \n\nGuided modes follow slightly different paths and experience \n\nslightly different refractive indexes in the core, causing modal \n\ndispersion. This phenomenon limits the fiber bandwidth, reducing the \n\namount of data transmitted per unit of time. [63] \n\nMultimode graded-index fibers mitigate this problem by \n\nchanging the core index of refraction profile to make the core act as a \n\nseries of lenses that periodically focus the light beam as it propagates \n\ndown the fiber. This technique reduces the amount of individual \n\npropagation modes down to about 300 for a typical graded-index fiber. \n[63] \n\nThe ultimate solution to manage modal noise and maximize \n\nbandwidth came in the form of monomode fibers. By greatly reducing \n\nthe core diameter until it approaches the wavelength of the guided light, \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\ndiffraction effects dominate and light becomes constrained to propagate \n\nonly along the waveguide axis. When ? ? 2.405 only one mode is \nallowed to propagate, this is referred to as the cutoff condition. [63] \n\nThe monomode fiber described above is not truly monomode in a \n\nsense that two modes with degenerate polarization states are allowed to \n\npropagate. There are various solutions to remove this degeneracy and let \n\na single linear polarization state propagate. Figure 3-4 shows the most \n\ncommon polarization maintaining fibers. [63] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-4 \u2013 Types of polarization maintaining fibers: (a) elliptical core fiber; \n\n(b) bow-tie stress-induced birefringent fiber; (c) stress-induced birefringent \n\nfiber using bars. [63] \n\n \n\nElliptical core fibers are the simplest solution for maintaining \n\npolarization. If the core-cladding index difference is sufficiently high, \n\nlight with linear polarization aligned along the major axis will retain its \n\npolarization state. [63] \n\nFabricating a fiber with built-in stress causes stress birefringence, \n\ni.e., the stress induces an index of refraction difference between a major \n\nand a minor axis. Light propagating along the major axis preserves its \n\npolarization state. [63] \n\nThere is also a type of fiber called polarizing fiber that is \n\ndesigned to induce high transmission loss for undesired polarization \n\nstates, allowing only a single state to propagate. This kind of fiber is \n\nvery useful in optical sensing applications that rely on the control of the \n\npolarization state. [63] \n\n3.1.3 Signal Attenuation \n\nThere are three main attenuation mechanisms for light signals \n\ntraveling through an optical fiber. Absorption, which is related to the \n\nfiber material; scattering, which is dependent on both fiber material and \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nwaveguide imperfections; and radiative losses, originated from \n\nperturbations of the fiber geometry. [63][65] \n\nTotal absorption is the combination of effects from three distinct \n\nabsorption mechanisms: absorption by atomic defects in the glass \n\ncomposition, extrinsic absorption by impurity atoms and intrinsic \n\nabsorption by basic fiber constituent atoms. [65] \n\nAtomic defects in the glass structure are missing molecules, high-\n\ndensity atom clusters and oxygen defects. Absorption loss from atomic \n\ndefects is negligible in comparison with the other absorption \n\nmechanisms under normal circumstances, but can become significant \n\n(Figure 3-5) if the fiber is subjected to ionizing radiation. [63][65] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-5 \u2013 Left: Induced absorption loss due to steady exposure to ionizing \n\nradiation (1 rad(Si) = 100 erg/g = 0.01 J/kg). Right: Recovery as a function of \n\ntime after radiation exposure has ceased. Adapted from [65]. \n\n \n\nThe presence of OH- (water) and transition metal ions impurities \n\nin the fiber is the dominant absorption mechanism. Even 1 ppm \n\nconcentration of these impurities can lead to absorption losses up to 4 \n\ndB/km. Improvements to the fiber fabrication process, to significantly \n\nreduce the presence of contaminants, were paramount in achieving the \n\nlow-loss fibers (0.2 dB/km) in use today. Table 3-1 contains absorption \n\nloss information for commonly occurring impurities. [63][65] \n\nIntrinsic loss occurs due to absorption of photons by electronic \n\nand vibrational transitions in the fiber. Electronic transitions occur \n\nmainly in the ultraviolet for Si based fibers and its effects decrease \n\nexponentially as wavelength increases. Vibrational transition losses are \n\nstronger in the 8 to 12 ?? region of the spectrum.

The index of refraction fluctuation is small \n\ncompared with the wavelength, causing Rayleigh scattering of the \n\ntransmitted light [63][65]. For single component glass, the scattering \n\nloss at a given wavelength ? can be approximated by Equation 3.6 [65].  \n\n ?????? =\n8?3\n\n3?4\n?8?2???? ??   \n\n (3.6) \n\nWhere ? is the photoelastic coefficient, ?? is the Boltzmann\u2019s \nconstant, ?? is the isothermal compressibility of the material, and the \nfictive temperature ?? is the temperature at which the density \nfluctuations are frozen into the glass as it solidifies after the fiber \n\ndrawing process. \n\nNote that ?????? in Equation 3.6 is given in nepers (base e units); \none can convert it to dB for optical power attenuation calculations by \n\nmultiplying ?????? by 10 log ? = 4.343. [65] \nFinally, radiative losses occur due to macroscopic and \n\nmicroscopic bending. Microbending locally disrupts total internal \n\nreflection at the core-cladding boundary, leading to light leakage as \n\nshown in Figure 3-6. [63][65]  \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-6 - Microbending loss mechanism. Adapted from [65]. \n\n \n\nMacroscopic bending leads to power loss by two distinct \n\nmechanisms. The first loss mechanism is similar to microbending loss, \n\nwhere the local curvature of the fiber can lead to partial reflection at the \n\ncore-cladding interface, as illustrated in Figure 3-7. [63] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-7 \u2013 Bending induced loss by partial internal reflection. [63] \n\n \n\nThe second loss mechanism can be explained by modal analysis \n\nof the propagating light wave. Light ray representation is just an \n\napproximation of the behavior of light in a waveguide, in reality a \n\npropagating mode is not fully restrained to the core of the fiber. Any \n\nbound core mode has an evanescent field tail in the cladding that moves \n\nwith the field in the core and decays exponentially with the distance \n\nfrom the core. A guided mode field in a curved optical waveguide is \n\nrepresented in Figure 3-8. [65] \n\nFrom Figure 3-8 it is evident that the field tail further away from \n\nthe center of curvature has to travel at a higher speed to keep up with the \n\nfield in the core. At a distance ?? from the center of the core, the field \ntail has to move at the speed of light to follow the core field. Since the \n\nfield would need to move faster than the speed of light for ? > ??, \nwhich is not possible, the optical energy in this region radiates away. \n\n[65] \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-8 - Bending induced loss in evanescent field tail. Adapted from [65]. \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Pulse Dispersion \n\nAs it propagates through a waveguide, a light signal not only \n\nexperiences attenuation but it also becomes increasingly distorted. Light \n\npulses get progressively wider and can superpose with adjacent pulses. \n\nThis pulse widening is referred as pulse dispersion or pulse spreading, \n\nand it can be explained by examining how the waveguide affects the \n\ngroup velocity of guided modes. [65] \n\nDispersion effects can be divided in three categories; intermodal \n\ndispersion, intramodal dispersion and polarization mode dispersion. \n\nIntermodal dispersion is a distortion mechanism exclusive to \n\nmultimode fibers. Figure 3-3 illustrates that each mode propagates in a \n\nslightly different path inside the fiber. Some modes follow a longer path \n\nto get from one point along the fiber axis to another point, and thus have \n\nlower axial group velocity. Slower modes lag behind faster modes and \n\nthe multimode pulse broadens. The maximum pulse broadening ??, \nwhich corresponds to the difference between the time the fastest mode \n\nand the slowest mode take to travel down a fiber of length ?, can be \ndetermined by Equation 3.7. [65] \n\n \n \n\n?? = ???? ? ???? =\n??1\n\n2\n\n??2\n? \n\n \n(3.7) \n\nWhere ? is the fiber length and ? is the core-cladding index \ndifference as defined in Equation 3.3. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nIntramodal dispersion occurs within a single mode, it is mainly \n\ncaused by material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. Material \n\ndispersion is derived from the fact that the index of refraction of the \n\nfiber core is a function of wavelength, and that every light source has \n\nnon-zero spectral width. Each wavelength propagates with a slightly \n\ndifferent speed, broadening the pulse. [65] \n\nWaveguide dispersion occurs because part of the optical power \n\npropagates in the cladding, as shown in Figure 3-8. Since the core and \n\nthe cladding have different refractive indexes, light moves at different \n\nspeeds in these regions, broadening the pulse. This effect is more \n\npronounced in monomode fibers, in which the reduced core diameter \n\nmeans more light propagates in the cladding. [65] \n\nPolarization mode dispersion is a direct result of birefringence \n\nalong the fiber. Birefringence can be caused by intrinsic factors, such as \n\nbuilt-in stress or circularity error in the core; and extrinsic factors, like \n\nlateral compression, torsion or flexure. Under these conditions \n\northogonal polarization modes will undergo dispersion as they \n\nexperience distinct refractive indexes, as represented in Figure 3-9. [65] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-9 - Polarization mode dispersion along birefringent fiber. Adapted \n\nfrom [65]. \n\n3.2 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) \n\nThe phenomenon of photosensitivity in optical fibers, in which \n\nfiber gratings are based on, was first observed in 1978 during \n\nexperiments with germanium doped silica fibers. Germanium is the \n\nmost used dopant in low loss fused silica optical fibers to raise the \n\ncore\u2019s index of refraction. As it replaces silicon atoms in the glass \n\nstructure, germanium creates structural defects. Ultraviolet radiation can \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nmodify the nature of the defects, leading to changes in the local \n\nrefractive index. [64] \n\nSince then fiber gratings applications on telecommunications and \n\nsensors has been widespread. Applications of this technology include \n\nstabilization of laser diodes to pump fiber light sources, repeater links in \n\ntelecommunication lines, wavelength division multiplexing, dispersion \n\ncompensation on long distance fiber links and a multitude of grating-\n\nbased fiber sensors. [63][64] \n\n3.2.1 Fundamentals \n\nIn their 1978 study, Hill et al. [66] describe how standing wave \n\npatterns, from a visible argon-ion laser launched into an optical fiber \n\nand back-reflected from the fiber end, created a periodic modulation of \n\nthe core refractive index that acts as a reflection filter. This laid the \n\nfoundation for fiber reflection gratings research. \n\nWhile research on photosensitivity and reflection grating writing \n\nwith transmitted light continued, Meltz et al. [67] demonstrated a \nreflection grating for visible light written with interfering UV beams \n\nexternal to the optical fibers, making modern compact high-reflectivity \n\nfiber Bragg gratings possible. \n\nFigure 3-10 illustrates what happens when a broadband signal \n\ntraveling down an optical fiber passes through a FBG. The FBG acts as \n\na passive narrowband reflection filter. The resulting signal can be \n\nanalyzed from both ends of the fiber, as the main parameter of interest is \n\nthe peak reflected wavelength or the corresponding transmission local \n\nminimum wavelength, usually referred as the Bragg wavelength ??. \nThe value of ?? is directly related to intrinsic FBG parameters: \n\nthe grating period and refractive index change; and extrinsic factors \n\nsuch as strain and temperature. By tracking how ?? varies to changes in \nstrain and temperature it is possible to use the FBG as a sensor and \n\nmeasure these changes. \n\n3.2.2 Fabrication \n\nThe grating writing method used by Meltz et al. [67] is referred \nas holographic method. An amplitude division interferometer is used to \n\ndivide and recombine an UV beam, the resulting interference pattern \n\ncreates a periodic modulation of the refractive index in the fiber core, as \n\nshown in Figure 3-11. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-10 - Reflected and Transmitted Spectrum of a fiber Bragg grating. [53] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-11 \u2013 Typical setup for holographic writing of Bragg gratings. [64] \n\n \n\nSubstitution of the classic holographic setup for a phase mask and \n\na set of mirrors (Figure 3-12) resulted in a much more flexible writing \n\nmethod. By rotating and moving the mirrors, it is easy to adjust the \n\ngrating length and period. [64] \n\nGrating inscription automation is available in the form of draw \ntowers (Figure 3-13), a process in which fiber drawing and grating \n\ninscription processes are synchronized. [68] \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-12 - Bragg grating writing with a phase mask interferometer. [64] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-13 - Draw tower grating inscription setup. [68]Figure 3-13 \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Strain and Temperature Measurement \n\nAs discussed in the previous sections, FBGs are narrowband \n\nreflection filters with a well-defined peak reflected wavelength ?? that \nshifts when strain or temperature varies. \n\nBy modelling the periodic index of refraction modulation as \n\nmultiple layers (Figure 3-14) with slight different refractive indexes, it is \n\npossible to derive how ?? responds to strain and temperature variations \nwithout resorting to complicated waveguide modal analysis. [69] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-14 - Multiple reflections in a multilayer structure. [69] \n\n \n\nAs light traverses the layered structure of mean index of \n\nrefraction ?0, it experiences partial reflection in each interface between \nthe regions of higher and lower refractive index. These multiple \n\nreflections can interfere with each other and the wavelength of \n\nmaximum reflectivity ??  will be the one with strongest constructive \ninterference. It can be shown that for this model ?? is given by Equation \n3.8, where ? is the period of the refractive index modulation. [69] \n\n ?? = 2?0?  (3.8) \n\nFor an optical fiber, the only difference is that instead of ?0 each \nguided mode experiences a slightly different effective index of \n\nrefraction ???, so Equation 3.8 can be rewritten as Equation 3.9. [69] \n\n ?? = 2??? ?  (3.9) \n\nAfter partial differentiation of Equation 3.9, the change in ?? as a \nfunction of changes in temperature ?? and grating section length ?? is \ngiven by Equation 3.10. [70] \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n???\n2\n\n= [(?\n????\n\n??\n+ ???\n\n??\n\n??\n) ?? + (?\n\n????\n\n??\n+ ???\n\n??\n\n??\n) ??] (3.10) \n\nEquation 3.10 is then usually reduced and linearized for ??, \ntransforming into Equation 3.11, where  is the strain component \n\nparallel to the axis of the FBG, ?? is the strain-optic tensor, ?? is the \n\ncoefficient of thermal expansion and ?? the thermo-optic coefficient for \n\nthe optical fiber. [70][71] \n\n \n???\n??\n\n= (1 ? ?? )? + (?? + ?? )?? \n \n\n(3.11) \n\nThe coefficients in Equation 3.11 can be determined \n\nexperimentally or derived from the properties of the fiber material. \n\nTypical values for (?? + ?? ) and (1 ? ??) are, respectively,  \n\n7.64 x 10?6 ??1 and 0.769. [71] \n\n3.2.4 Multi-Parameter FBGs \n\nEquation 3.11 shows that a single FBG sensor does not \n\ndiscriminate between temperature and strain variations. Both parameters \n\ninfluence ??? directly in a non-dissociable way. \nLike regular strain gages, there are many situations where \n\ncompensating for temperature is important. Continuous research on fiber \n\ngrating technology and optical fiber sensors led to many solutions to this \n\nproblem, both in the form of temperature independent and multi-\n\nparameter sensors. \n\nFraz\u00e3o et al. [72] and Kinet et al. [73] compiled a comprehensive \n\nlist of multi-parameter optical fiber sensors based on grating technology. \n\nMany more sensor configurations can be found in specialized literature, \n\nbut not all can be readily used in this work. Three promising (in the \n\ncontext of this work) multi-parameter configurations are discussed in the \n\nfollowing paragraphs. \n\nMawatari &amp; Nelson [74] further explore a multi-parameter \n\nconfiguration (Figure 3-15) that uses two superposed Bragg gratings \n\nwritten in a birefringent polarization maintaining fiber. Their linear \n\nsystem model has good longitudinal strain prediction capability (error \n\n&lt;10%) but poor transverse strain prediction capability (error of 10-\n\n100%). The paper also details a generalized non-linear model with \n\ngreatly improved results (measurement error &lt;3%). \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-15 - Multi-parameter sensor configuration with dual Bragg gratings in \n\npolarization maintaining fiber. [74] \n\n \n\n \n\nWith two gratings and the birefringence, this sensor has four \n\nindependent reflection peaks, as illustrated in Figure 3-16. Subscripts \u20182\u2019 \n\nand \u20183\u2019 are in relation to the axis defined in Figure 3-15, while \u2018a\u2019 and \n\n\u2018b\u2019 refers to the 1300 nm grating and 1550 nm grating respectively. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-16 - Quadruple reflection peaks from the dual grating birefringent fiber \n\nsensor.

Reflectivity of the interface with the fiber is a \n\nfunction of the thermochromic material\u2019s refractive index, which in turn \n\nis temperature dependent. By measuring the optical power shift of the \n\nback reflection at the fiber tip (Figure 3-18), it is possible to determine \n\nthe temperature, with an accuracy of 0.153 \u00baC in the range from 20 \u00baC to \n\n80 \u00b0C, and correct ??? for a pure strain measurement. \n \n\n \nFigure 3-17 - Basic configuration for temperature and strain measurement with \n\nFBG and thermochromic material.

[76] used a FBG in series with an erbium-doped fiber \n\namplifier (EDFA), as shown in Figure 3-19, to discriminate between \n\ntemperature and strain.

This is evident when analyzing the transmitted power of the \nEDFA/FBG system shown in Figure 3-20. Although this is a bulky \n\nsetup, the authors later reported [77] a compact setup, achieved by \n\nwriting the FBG in an erbium-ytterbium-doped fiber instead of using a \n\nseparated EDFA.

[78] \n\n \n\nWhat happens to light propagating across the Fabry-Per\u00f3t cavity \n\ndepends on the proportion between its wavelength and the cavity length. \n\nIf the cavity length is an integral number of half-wavelengths (Figure \n\n3-22) the cavity is said to be resonant and light is strongly transmitted \n\nthrough. Otherwise, it is non-resonant and transmission is attenuated. \n\n[78] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-22 - Resonant Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer. [78] \n\n \n\nThe cavity length ? can then uniquely define resonant \nwavelengths, as shows Equation 3.13, where ? is a positive non-zero \ninteger. [78] \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n ? =\n2?\n\n?\n \n\n \n(3.13) \n\nBy substituting ? = ?/? in Equation 3.13, where ? is the speed \nof light inside the cavity, the frequency ??  of the k-th resonating \nwavelength is given by Equation 3.14.  \n\n ?? = ?\n?\n\n2?\n \n\n \n(3.14) \n\nAnd Equation 3.15 gives the value of  ??  for the (k+1)th mode. \n\n ??+1 = (? + 1)\n?\n\n2?\n \n\n \n(3.15) \n\nTherefore the free spectral range ??, that is, the frequency \ndifference between consecutive e resonating modes (i.e. transmission \n\npeaks) is also defined by ? in Equation 3.16. [78] \n\n ?? =\n?\n\n2?\n \n\n \n(3.16) \n\n In the same way the cavity length defines the resonating \n\nwavelengths, the reflectance ? of the partial reflecting surfaces \ndetermine how broad and well-defined transmission peaks are. A useful \n\nparameter to quantify this is the finesse ?, as defined by equation 3.17. \n[63] \n\n ? =\n4?\n\n(1 ? ?)2\n \n\n \n(3.17) \n\nFigure 3-23 shows the impact of ? in the transmission spectrum \nof a Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer.  \n\nIn optical fibers, FPIs can be easily made both intrinsically to the \n\nfiber with reflective splices, or extrinsically by inserting two separated \n\npieces of fiber into an external spacer. [63] \n\n3.3.2 Strain and Temperature Measurement \n\nThe most intuitive way of measuring with FFPIs is to exploit the \n\nrelationship between transmission (or reflection) peaks and cavity \n\nlength.

[63] \n\n \n\nExpanding the left side of Equation 3.16 yields: \n\n ?1 ? ?2 =\n?\n\n2?\n \n\n \n(3.18) \n\nThen, using ? = ?/?: \n\n \n?\n\n?1\n?\n\n?\n\n?2\n=\n\n?\n\n2?\n \n\n \n(3.19) \n\nFinally, it is easy to get to Equation 3.20 from Equation 3.19. \n\nNote that it is being assumed that the refractive index difference for the \n\ntwo wavelengths is negligible and thus ? is the same for both. \n\n ? =\n?1?2\n\n2(?2 ? ?1)\n \n\n \n(3.20) \n\nBy measuring ?? in relation to the nominal cavity length ?0, strain \nacting on the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity can be calculated with Equation 3.21. \n\n \n??\n\n?0\n= ??? = + ??? \n\n \n(3.21) \n\nWhere ??? is the total strain, given by the sum of the mechanical \n\nstrain  and thermal expansion ???. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Hybrid FFPI-FBG \n\nEquation 3.21 is very similar to Equation 3.11 and reveals the \n\nsame strain/temperature discrimination problem. \n\nKang et al. [71] demonstrated a solution to this problem by \n\nproposing a hybrid FFPI-FBG sensor. As shown in Figure 3-24, the \n\nFFPI comes in an extrinsic configuration. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-24 - Hybrid FFPI/FBG temperature and strain sensor. [71] \n\n \n\nThe FBG in this hybrid sensor is insensitive to mechanical strain. \n\nTemperature can be measured directly with the FBG and used to extract \n\nmechanical strain from the FFPI\u2019s response. \n\n3.4 Reflectometry Based Distributed Sensors \n\n3.4.1 Fundamentals \n\nReflectometry based sensing extracts strain and temperature \n\ninformation along an optical fiber by analyzing backscattered light. \n\n Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques are \n\nbased on time of flight of short light pulses to determine what position \n\nalong the fiber length is being interrogated. Although capable of \n\ndistributed sensing, resolution is often limited to a few meters for \n\nOTDR, making it impractical for what this work proposes. [63] \n\nAlternatively, Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) \n\ncan provide distributed sensing with spatial resolution in the order of \n\ntens of micrometers. [80][81] \n\n3.4.2 Strain and Temperature Measurement \n\nThe typical OFDR setup uses a tunable laser source and a Mach-\n\nZehnder or similar interferometer (Figure 3-25) to measure the Rayleigh \n\nbackscattering profile along the optical fiber. [80][81] \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nVarying the frequency of the laser source results in a periodic \n\nsignal in the detector. The frequency of the generated signal is directly \n\nrelated to the distance to the source of the backscatter. The further down \n\nthe fiber, the higher is the signal frequency. [80][81] \n\nThe detector receives backscatter information from the entire \n\nfiber at once, so the frequency components of the signal must be \n\nseparated using a Fourier Transform to calculate Rayleigh backscatter as \n\na function of position along the fiber. Extracted frequency data is then \n\ndivided in small parts, usually equivalent to a few millimeters or less of \n\nfiber length, to be analyzed. [80][81] \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-25 - OFDR setup with tunable laser and a Mach-Zehnder \n\ninterferometer. [80] \n\n \n\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, Rayleigh scattering is caused \n\nby small fluctuations in the refractive index of the fiber\u2019s core due to \n\nimperfections or inclusions in the glass. \n\nWhen strained or subjected to a change in temperature, these \n\nfluctuations change slightly, causing a shift in the frequency spectrum, \n\nas illustrated in Figure 3-26. [80][81] \n\nIt is evident that the behavior of the backscatter profile is very \n\nsimilar to a FBG, showing well-defined spectral shifts. In a way this \n\ntechnique uses the entire fiber as a collection of small FBGs adjacent to \n\neach other. [80][81] \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nAn application for distributed temperature measurement with \n\nOFDR [80]  is shown in Figure 3-27, while Figure 3-28 shows the \n\nresults of a strain measurement along the top of a beam subjected to a \n\nfour point bending test [81]. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-26 - Nominal and strained Rayleigh backscatter profile along a 5 mm \n\nfiber segment.

This stage can be divided into two sub-stages: assembling \n\nbonded joints and assembling pipeline sections. The bonding process \n\ncan introduce defects such as voids, lack of adhesive and debonding. \n\nAssembling the pipeline may introduce unwanted stress in the pipes due \n\nto poorly designed fixtures or excessive use of force to correct \n\nmisalignments. Both situations can severely compromise the integrity of \n\nthe pipeline and must be observed. \n\nOverloads, water hammer, material fatigue and other mishaps \n\nduring operation can result in catastrophic failure or aggravation of pre-\n\nexisting defects. Premature failure can incur in high financial and \n\nenvironmental costs, while preventive and corrective maintenance also \n\nhave associated costs. Long term monitoring during this stage can have \n\nsignificant impact in lowering costs and risks of running an oil and gas \n\nrig. \n\nQuality control of pipes and fittings fabrication is of interest of \nthe supplier, and so will not be an object of study in this work.  \n\nAfter determining that the stages of interest are joint fabrication, \n\npiping systems installation and operation, it is interesting to look how \n\ncurrent quality control standards deal with this problem. \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Preexisting Standards \n\nNorsok M-622, ISO 14692-4 and NBR 15921-4 standards for \n\nglass reinforced plastic piping systems already specify hydrostatic \n\ntesting procedure for piping spools, prefabricated adhesive bonded joints \n\nand field made adhesive bonded joints. They also detail procedures and \n\nacceptance criteria for ultrasonic and radiographic testing of bonded \n\njoints. \n\nTo keep the monitoring strategy proposed in this work as \n\nunobtrusive as possible, it has been decided to use the pre-existing \n\nhydrostatic tests as the mean to evaluate the adhesive bonding process \n\nwith the integrated sensors. This also benefits the long-term sensing \n\nstrategy, as loading during operation will be heavily influenced by \n\noperating pressure. Pipe systems assembly is therefore excluded from \n\nthis analysis and left for a future work. \n\nHaving decided on hydrostatic pressure tests, the number of tests \n\nand a few other details must be discussed. \n\n4.1.3 Proposed Tests \n\nThere is a better chance of successfully detecting defects internal \n\nto the adhesive bonded joint if the sensors are embedded into it. Since \n\nthis is an unconventional procedure, a few sensor embedding tests must \n\nbe made for validation purposes. It is expected that computed \n\ntomography of adhesive bonded joints with embedded sensors can \n\nprovide enough information to validate this procedure. Instrumentation \n\nmust be allocated for at least two insertion tests. \n\nIt is important to compare the data provided by the sensors \n\nembedded in a pristine joint and one with purposefully inserted defects, \n\nto verify how they respond to the presence of defects. This can be \n\nthought as defect detectability test. There is an ongoing research at \n\nLabmetro for the development of a digital shearography system to \n\ninspect composites and the latest shearography system will also be used \n\nduring this test to compare defect detectability. \n\nSection 2.7 presents a discussion on how the presence of \n\nembedded sensors can affect mechanical properties of composites and \n\nadhesive bonded joints. By gradually increasing internal pressure until \nfailure occurs and comparing maximum achievable pressure of joints, \n\nwith and without embedded sensors, the impact of the fibers in the \n\npressure rating can be evaluated. At least three tests for each condition \n\nare required for statistical significance. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Summarizing Design Decisions \n\nFor a clearer understanding of what has been discussed in this \n\nsection, all experiments design decisions are summarized below: \n\n \n\n? Monitoring pipeline assembly process has been left out \nin favor of joint fabrication and long-term operation \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\n? Defect detectability tests and impact on pressure rating \ntests will be executed with hydrostatic loading to better \n\nharmonize with pre-existing quality control standards; \n\n \n\n? Two sensor embedment tests are to be performed to \nvalidate insertion strategy. CT scans will provide the \n\nneeded data; \n\n \n\n? Detectability tests will consist of comparing strain \ninformation from a pristine joint to another with planned \n\ndefects. Digital shearography will be used for \n\ncomparison purposes and CT will provide additional \n\ninformation; \n\n \n\n? Six adhesive bonded joints, half with embedded sensors \nand the other half without sensors, will be pressurized \n\nuntil failure to determine the impact, if any, of the \n\nembedded sensors in the joint\u2019s pressure rating; \n\n \n\n4.2 Test Specimen Design \n\nFiberglass-epoxy pipes with 150 mm (6\u201d) nominal diameter and \n\nadhesive bonded bell and spigot joints, such as the one in Figure 4-1, \n\nhave been well studied before in Labmetro for the digital shearography \n\nresearch programs. \n\nIn this configuration the spigot\u2019s extremity is shaved to create a \n1.5 to 2.0 mm radial clearance in relation to the bell, which leaves \n\nplenty of space for the optical fiber sensors to be inserted into the \n\nadhesive layer. \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-1 - Fiberglass-epoxy pipe with adhesive bonded bell and spigot joint. \n\n \n\nThis particular pipe and fittings product line is bonded using a bi-\n\ncomponent epoxy-based adhesive. \n\nSteel blind flanges, with a central threaded hole for hydraulic \n\nconnections (Figure 4-2), are available from previous projects to be used \n\nwith new test specimens for hydrostatic testing. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-2 - Steel blind flange fixed to the flanged end of a fiberglass-epoxy \n\npipe. \n\n \n\nThe simplest specimen design is a straight pipe section, with a \n\nsingle bell and spigot joint in the center, flanged ends and with total \n\nlength that can fit into the available industrial CT machine. This design \n\nis illustrated in Figure 4-3. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-3 - Straight 150 mm (6\") pipe with a single bell and spigot joint. \n\n \n\nConsidering two test specimens for sensor embedding tests, two \n\nfor the comparison between pristine and defective joints, and two sets of \n\nthree specimens for destructive testing, the total amount of test \n\nspecimens is ten. \n\nAfter designing the specimen and determining how many are \n\nneeded, the company that provided some specimens for previous \n\nprojects, including the one depicted in Figure 4-2, was contacted and \n\nagreed to provide the specimens for academic research purposes in \n\nexchange for full test result disclosure. \n\n4.3 Instrumentation Design \n\nThis study is starting a new line of research in the Federal \n\nUniversity of Santa Catarina where the main objective is to evaluate the \n\nfeasibility of using embedded optical fiber sensors for SHM of adhesive \n\nbonded joints in pipelines. A good approach is to start with a simple \n\nsingle parameter FBG, evaluate its strong points and shortcomings, and \n\npropose a better sensing element for future works. \n\nThe reasoning behind the embedded instrumentation is that the \n\npresence of defects disrupts the strain distribution in the bonded joint. \n\nBy measuring strain in various locations, compounding them into an \n\napproximation of the strain field and looking for spots with abnormal \n\nstrain changes, it is possible to detect the presence of defects such as \n\ndebonding or lack of adhesive \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nFrom this perspective, instrumentation was designed accordingly \n\nto the geometrical characteristics of the test specimens to provide good \n\nstrain measuring coverage without employing an excessive number of \n\noptical fibers that could compromise the joint\u2019s mechanical properties \n\nRelevant geometrical characteristics are insertion depth, which is \n\nthe length of the spigot that is inserted into the bell, and spigot diameter, \n\nwhich defines its circumference. Geometry discontinuities in both \n\nextremities of the inserted section leads to regions with stress \n\nconcentration. Figure 4-4 contains a cross-section representation of the \n\nspigot with those characteristics pointed out.  \n\nInsertion length can be used to determine the length of a sensing \n\nfiber with FBGs embedded axially into the adhesive layer of the joint, \n\nwhile the circumference provides the circumferential separation between \n\nfibers for different number of fibers per joint. Accordingly to the \n\nsupplier\u2019s product manual, for a pipe with 6\u201d nominal diameter, \n\ninsertion depth is 57 mm and mean spigot diameter 166.4 mm. A mean \n\ndiameter of 166.4 mm is equivalent to a mean circumference of \n\n522.76 mm.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4-4 - Spigot cross-section indicating insertion depth, spigot diameter and \n\nstress concentration areas. \n\n \n\nThe circumferential separation between two consecutive fibers is the length of \n\nthe arc between them, as shown in Figure 4-5. Table 4-1 \nTable 4-1 contains the circumferential separations values and \n\nnumber of fibers in a full circle for some separation angles. There is a \n\ncompromise between circumferential separation and number of fibers \n\nper bonded joint. Smaller separation between fibers results in better \n\nstrain sensing coverage, but more fibers raises costs and can have \n\ndeleterious effects on joint pressure rating. Taking these factors into \n\naccount the value of twelve fibers per joint is a good middle ground. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-5 - Schematic representation of circumferential separation between \n\noptical fibers. \n\n \nTable 4-1 \u2013 Circumferential separation and number of fibers in a bonded joint \n\nbased on fiber separation angle. \n\nSeparation \n\nAngle (degrees) \n\nCircumferential \n\nSeparation (mm) \n\nNumber of \n\nFibers \n\n45 65.35 8 \n\n30 43.56 12 \n\n18 26.14 20 \n\n15 21.78 24 \n\n \n\nHigher stress in the stress concentration regions makes \n\nmonitoring them especially important. One FBG must be placed near \n\nthese points, but not too close to the borders or it can be damaged during \n\nthe assembly process. \n\nUtilizing only one FBG at each stress concentration points would \n\nleave a relatively big sensing void in the middle of the inserted section, \n\nconsidering the typical grating length of about 5 mm. Taking into \n\naccount the number of fibers per bonded joint and the total of seven \n\ninstrumented joints, the total number of sensors increases very fast for \n\neach FBG included between the other two. So, considering that the \n\navailable financial resources must cover all sensors, a single FBG was \n\nadded between the others. \n\nThe resulting three FBG array (Figure 4-6) is also provided with \n\na 0.9 mm loose tube and a FC/APC connector. This tube is intended to \n\nprotect the unembedded section and prevent the fiber from breaking at \n\nthe point it leaves the adhesive.  \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nThe chosen buffer coating material is polyimide, as it is easily \n\navailable on the market, can withstand the adhesive cure temperature of \n\nabout 100 \u00baC and is chemically compatible with epoxy adhesives. [82] \n\n \nFigure 4-6 - Three FBG array with loose tube and FC/APC connector. \n\n \n\nIn order to avoid confusion when embedding and interrogating a \n\nset of twelve fibers, each fiber in a set has three FBGs with unique \n\nnominal Bragg wavelength combinations. These combinations are made \n\nfrom six possible values, which is the smallest pool size that allows for \n\nat least twelve unique combinations: 1530 nm, 1535 nm, 1540 nm, 1545 \n\nnm, 1550 nm and 1555 nm. The twelve combinations in each set are \n\nlisted in Table 4-2. \n\n \nTable 4-2 - Nominal Bragg wavelength combinations per set of twelve fibers. \n\nCombination ?? FBG 1 \n(nm) \n\n?? FBG 2 \n(nm) \n\n?? FBG 3 \n(nm) \n\n1 1530 1535 1540 \n\n2 1535 1540 1545 \n\n3 1540 1545 1550 \n\n4 1545 1550 1555 \n\n5 1530 1540 1550 \n\n6 1535 1545 1555 \n\n7 1530 1540 1545 \n\n8 1535 1545 1550 \n\n9 1540 1550 1555 \n\n10 1530 1535 1545 \n\n11 1535 1540 1550 \n\n12 1540 1545 1555 \n\n \n\nIt is also interesting to investigate if FBGs integrated to the outer \nside of the bell and spigot joint can also detect the presence of defects.  \n\nA sub-surface defect can produce detectable disturbances in the \n\nstrain field at the outer surface; this effect is exploited with optical \n\ninterferometric techniques such as holography and shearography, as \n\nshown in Chapter 2. \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nFor this purpose, a longer chain of FBGs has been designed to be \n\nwrapped around the circumference of the bell\u2019s outer surface. The bell\u2019s \n\nexternal circumference was measured from Figure 4-1 pipe using a \n\nmeasuring tape to be approximately 600 mm. To match the number and \n\nposition of the axial fibers, this longer fiber was given twelve FBGs \n\nequally spaced by 50 mm.  \n\nThe longer fiber is also polyimide coated and has a FC/APC \n\nconnector. Its nominal Bragg wavelengths are distributed between 1530 \n\nnm and 1557.5 nm, with uniform 2.5 nm difference between adjacent \n\nsensors. \n\n4.4 CPVC Test Specimen \n\nUnfortunately, just after the designed instrumentation was bought \n\nand delivered, the company that originally agreed to supply the test \n\nspecimens contacted Labmetro dismissing the deal. As resources for \n\nacquiring new test specimens were scarce, the first alternative was to \n\nlook for readily available low cost PVC or other similar material pipes \n\nthat usually have bonded joints. \n\nThe main concern was finding products with similar dimensions \n\nto the fiberglass-epoxy pipes, so that the sensors could still be used \n\nwithout complicated adaptations. \n\nA promising industrial CPVC piping systems line of products \n\nwas then prospected. Insertion depth was 57.5 mm for 4\u201d nominal \n\ndiameter pipes and fittings, practically the same depth the embedded \n\ninstrumentation was designed for. All available 6\u201d CPVC piping \n\nimplements had insertion depths far longer than 57 mm. \n\nThe use of a smaller diameter is an interesting change, since \n\nsmaller diameters lead to smaller circumferential separation between \n\nfibers, making for a better sensing coverage. However, the longer FBG \n\nchains, designed to be wrapped around the 6\u201d joint, no longer has \n\nsensors matching the position of embedded fibers. \n\nThe last problem that needed to be addressed was the \n\nparticularities of the adhesive bonding process between PVC and CPVC \n\npipes.  \n\nPVC and CPVC adhesives are solvents, the mating surfaces must \nbe dissolved into a semi-fluid and inserted with interference while they \n\nare still wet. This results in a joint whose surfaces are partially bonded \n\nand partially fused together [83], as shown in Figure 4-7.  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nThis bonding process does not provide enough space for \n\nembedding sensors and does not produce joints that behave similarly as \n\nthe ones in the fiberglass-epoxy systems. \n\nA workaround is to machine the spigot\u2019s outer surface to create a \n\n1 to 2 mm radial clearance and use a compatible bi-component plastic \n\nadhesive to bond the spigot to the bell, simulating the adhesive bonded \n\njoints described in section 0. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-7 - Solvent bonded PVC pipe and fitting with bonded and fused \n\nsurfaces. [83] \n\n \n\nA suitable, heavy-duty industrial methyl methacrylate based bi-\n\ncomponent adhesive, capable of bonding PVC substrates with up to  \n\n4 mm gap filling was found. Chemical compatibility and bonding \n\nefficiency with the fibers polyimide coating was unknown and needed to \n\nbe properly tested. As the chemical composition of CPVC is different \n\nfrom regular PVC, testing if the adhesive can provide a strong adhesive \n\nbond in CPVC is also required. \n\n4.4.1 Preliminary Tests \n\nA simple test was devised in order to test the compatibility \n\nbetween the adhesive, the CPVC pipes and the polyimide coating. For \n\nthe experiment, a straight piece of 22 mm nominal diameter CPVC pipe, \n\ntypically used for residential hot water installations, was acquired. \n\nAdditionally, a matching cap, a threaded adaptor, a sleeve and a bottle \n\nof solvent adhesive were also acquired. \nThe 22 mm CPVC pipe was cut in half. The solvent adhesive was \n\nused to bond the threaded adaptor and the sleeve to one of the halves \n\n(Figure 4-8). The other half had a sealing cap bonded into one end, \n\nwhile the other end was machined to create a 1 mm radial gap when \n\ninserted into the sleeve. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nA sample of the methyl methacrylate adhesive, kindly provided \n\nby its manufacturer, was then used to bond the machined piece to the \n\nvacant side of the sleeve. The sample was also used to glue a single \n\nthree FBG chain to the surface of the pipe, as shown in Figure 4-9. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-8 - Hot water installation CPVC pipe with one machined end \n\n(indicated by the yellow arrow) and solvent bonded fittings. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-9 - Left side of the sleeve and a single three FBG fiber (indicated by \n\nthe yellow arrow) bonded to the pipe using the methyl methacrylate adhesive. \n\nThe direction of strain sensitivity of the FBG indicated by the red arrow. \n\n \n\nThe FBG chain was aligned along the fiber axis in order to \n\nmeasure the axial strain in response to pressure loadings, as originally \n\nintended for the embedded fibers. This particular fiber was selected for \n\nbeing the only one containing one poorly written FBG (Figure 4-10). \n\nA testing bench was assembled using spare aluminum profiles, \n\nsteel plates, a vacuum chamber window and transparent acrylic sheets \n\n(Figure 4-11). The CPVC test specimen was fitted with a manometer \n\nand connected to a manual hydraulic pump, while the FBG chain was \n\nconnected to a FBG interrogator using a 5 meters reinforced patch cord. \n\nThree hydrostatic pressure tests were executed. The first one up \n\nto 10 kgf/cm\u00b2 (0.98 MPa) of internal manometric pressure to see if the \n\nmethyl methacrylate bond would hold. The results of this first test are \n\nsummarized in Figure 4-12. \n\nThe second test (Figure 4-13) had the test specimen pressurized \n\nup to 20 kgf/cm\u00b2 (1.96 MPa), close to its pressure rating of 2.20 MPa at \n\nroom temperature. At this point the bonded joint did not exhibit any \n\nsigns of imminent failure and the FBG signal had not started to degrade.  \n\n? \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-10 - Reflection spectrum of the FBG chain chosen for the adhesive \n\ntest. A poorly written FBG produces the weaker reflection peak to the left. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-11 - Assembled test bench. The test specimen can be seen resting \n\ninside and the manual hydraulic pump in the right side of the picture. \n\n \n\nTo fully test the capabilities of the adhesive a third test (Figure \n\n4-14) was started, with the intent of keep rising internal pressure until \n\nthe test specimen fails. The test was interrupted when internal pressure \n\nreached 80 kgf/cm\u00b2 (7.85 MPa), still before failure occur, due to safety \n\nconcerns. No FBG signal degradation was observed. \n\nBragg wavelength shift was very linear in every test, with no \n\nobservable hysteresis. The bonded joint\u2019s performance was far superior \n\nfrom the expected. CPVC pipes and the methyl methacrylate adhesive \n\nwere then considerate adequate substitutes to the fiberglass-epoxy pipes.  \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-12 \u2013 Response of the FBGs up to 10 kgf/cm\u00b2 internal pressure load.

Radial gap has been defined as 1.5 mm for all methyl \n\nmethacrylate bonded joints.  \n\nThe indicated 450 mm total length from the bottom of the cap to \n\nthe leftmost face of the sleeve is a design reference to ensure this section \n\nof the test specimen fits into the CT machine. To this end, the length of \n\nthe pipe piece to be solvent bonded to the cap and adhesive bonded to \n\nthe sleeve was set to 280 mm. \n\nThere is no length restriction for the pipe segment solvent bonded \n\nto the flange, since this part would not be tested with CT. Considering \n\nthe insertion depth of 57.5 mm into the sleeve, the length of this \n\nsegment was set to 200 mm, keeping the specimen compact with a total \n\nlength just short of 600 mm. \n\nThe number of test specimens can be reduced to seven, down \n\nfrom ten at Section 4.2, by cleverly using both sides of the sleeve in the \n\ndestructive tests. Instead of doing six separate destructive tests, three \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nwith embedded sensors and three without, it is possible to have three test \n\nspecimens where both sides of the sleeve are adhesive bonded.  \n\nIf sensors are embedded in just one side of the sleeve, and if a \n\ntendency for failure to occur in this side is observed, it will be \n\nconsidered a strong indication that the presence of the fibers is \n\ndeleterious to the bonded joint. \n\nThe number of embedded fibers remains the same. The reduced \n\ndiameter translates into a circumferential separation reduction from \n\n43.56 mm to approximately 30 mm.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nBefore performing tests with bonded joints all acquired sensors \n\nand patch cords (Figure 5-1) were tested to make sure no faulty sensor \n\nwould be used in the experiments. Only a single 3 FBG array had a \n\nfaulty sensor. It was separated from the others and then used for the \n\npreliminary CPVC pipe test described in the previous chapter.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-1 - 3 FBG arrays, 12 FBG arrays and patch cords. \n\n \n\nThe setup used to interrogate and test the sensors was basically \n\nthe same for all the experiments detailed in this chapter. The fibers were \n\nconnected to a 1x12 bi-directional MEMS switch (Figure 5-2), which \n\nwas then connected to a 4-channel FBG interrogator (Figure 5-3) using a \n\npatch cord.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-2 - Fibers connected to a 1x12 MEMS switch (indicated by the arrow). \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-3 - Optical sensing interrogator. \n\n \n\nThe switch is controlled by a laptop computer through a USB \n\nport, while the interrogator communicates to the computer using an \n\nEthernet port. \n\nTotal fiber length is less than 8 meters, with the 5 meters patch \n\ncords, 1 meter in/out switch ports plus sensing fiber length. The optical \n\nsignal travels approximately double this value since the FBGs reflection \n\nspectrum is the one being analyzed. This is relatively very short and \n\nsignal attenuation is not a concern considering attenuation values \n\npresented in Section 3.1.3. \n\nThe specimens were prepared by first cutting the straight pipe \n\npieces to the specified length. They were also machined to ensure a \n\nsquare cut and to provide the radial clearance when necessary (Figure \n\n5-4). \n\n \n\n   \nFigure 5-4 - Cut and machined pipe pieces. \n\n \n\nNext the caps and flanges were solvent bonded to the pipe pieces. \n\nThe caps to the longer pieces and the flanges to the shorter ones (Figure \n\n5-5). \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\n       \nFigure 5-5 - Solvent bonded cap (left) and flange (right). \n\n \n\nThe assembly process was finished by bonding these two parts to \n\na single sleeve. This is accomplished by first adhesive bonding the \n\ncapped piece, along with the embedded sensors, to a sleeve and then \n\neither adhesive or solvent bonding the flanged piece to the opposite side \n\nof the sleeve. \n\nA total of three test specimens were fully assembled. Further \n\ndetails on three, instead of seven as originally planned, will be provided \n\nin the following sections when appropriate. \n\n5.1 Optical Fibers Embedding Analysis \n\nAnalysis for the three test specimens, dubbed Specimen A, \n\nSpecimen B and Specimen C, are presented in order.  \n\nFor Specimen A, the embedding procedure is extensively \n\ndetailed. Adjustments made to the original procedure are discussed in \n\nthe section corresponding to the test specimen they were implemented. \n\nAfter detailing and discussing the embedding process, results \n\nfrom the CT scans and embedded sensors are presented, compared and \n\ndiscussed. \n\n5.1.1 Specimen A \n\nFirstly, the 3 FBG arrays were pre-positioned around the pipe \n\nusing adhesive tape, as shown in Figure 5-6. The loose tube enters \n\nslightly the area to be bonded, preventing the fiber from breaking in the \n\npoint it exits the cured adhesive. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-6 - FBG arrays pre-positioned on the pipe. \n\n \n\nNote that since this is the first attempt at embedding the sensors, \n\nthis test specimen is using the remainder 11 fibers from the set that has \n\none fiber with a defective FBG. The other two specimens have a full set \n\nof 12 fibers embedded into them. \n\nNext the tip of the fibers was glued to the pipe with a \n\ncyanoacrylate instant adhesive (Figure 5-7). This prevents the fiber from \n\nbending when the pipe is inserted into the sleeve, which could misalign \n\nor break the fibers. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-7 - Tip of the fibers glued to the pipe (orange arrows) and the direction \n\nof strain sensitivity of the FBGs (red arrows). \n\n? \n\n? \n\n? \n\n? \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nThe methyl methacrylate adhesive is first applied along the length \n\nof the fiber (Figure 5-8). It is made in order to further fix them in place \n\nand to avoid moving them during the procedure to spread the adhesive \n\naround the tube. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-8 - Adhesive applied directly along the fibers. \n\n \n\nAdhesive is then applied and spread along the rest of the spigot \n\nuntil a thick layer of adhesive covers the whole section that will be \n\ninserted in the sleeve, as shown in Figure 5-9. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-9 - Thick layer of methyl methacrylate adhesive covering the spigot. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nThe sleeve is also coated with a layer of methyl methacrylate \n\nadhesive. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-10 - Methyl methacrylate adhesive layer in the sleeve. \n\n \n\nThe adhesive, in the form of bi-component cartridges, was \n\napplied with the help of a manual adhesive gun and a plastic mixer \n\nnozzle (Figure 5-12). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-11- Adhesive gun with a loaded cartridge. Mixer nozzle detached from \n\nthe cartridge, to the right. \n\n \n\nFinally, the spigot and the sleeve are carefully mated and the \n\nadhesive is allowed to cure for 24 hours. This partial assembly (Figure \n\n5-12) is then evaluated by means of the FBG sensors and CT scanned \n\nbefore bonding the remaining part. \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-12- Partial test specimen assembly with embedded sensors. \n\n \n\nThe quality of the bonded joint can then be accessed for the first \n\ntime by measuring the shift of ?? for all FBGs and using Equation 3.11. \n?? was measured for all sensors after pre-positioning them and then \nmeasured again after the 24 hours curing period. \n\nRoom temperature was the same for both tests, so Equation 3.11 \n\ncan be simplified as follows.  \n\n \n???\n??\n\n= (1 ? ?? )?  \n \n\n(5.1) \n\nIsolating  and using (1 ? ??) = 0.769 (refer to Section 3.2.3): \n\n ? =\n106\n\n0.769\n\n???\n??\n\n     [??/?] \n \n\n(5.2) \n\nThe strain is expected to be compressive (negative), due to \n\nadhesive shrinkage during the curing process. [84] \n\nFigure 5-13 is a 3D plot of the cure strain distribution inside the \n\nadhesive layer, as measured by the FBGs. The Z axis is strain in ??/?. \nX axis (0 through 11) are the fibers. Fibers 0 and 11 were purposely \n\nplotted with the same data to visualize the strain for the full \n\ncircumference. The Y axis represent the three FBGs, being 0 the \n\ninnermost FBG and 2 the FBG nearest to the outer edge of the sleeve. \n\nInterpolation between strain values is bilinear. \n\nFigure 5-14 is a 2D color plot of the same strain distribution. The \n\ncolor bar indicates the strain, in ??/?, and the X and Y axis are the \nsame as in the 3D plot. Every plot from now on will use the same units, \n\naxis convention and interpolation as these two. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-13 - 3D plot with color bar of the cure strain distribution in the \n\nadhesive layer. Test specimen A. \n\n \nFigure 5-14- Color plot of the cure strain distribution in the adhesive layer. Test \n\nspecimen A. \n\n \n\nStrain distribution is evidently very disarranged. For the same \n\nvalue of Y, strain distribution along X was expected to be approximately \n\nuniform due to rotational symmetry but this is not observed. \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n There is also a pack of FBGs in fibers 2 to 7 with tractive \n\nloading, contradicting the predicted compressive strain due to adhesive \n\nshrinkage during the cure. \n\nThis is an indication that either the sensors are poorly bonded to \n\nthe adhesive, which is unlikely considering this was not observed in the \n\nsmaller CPVC pipe, or that many defects were unwillingly introduced \n\ninto the bonded joint. \n\nThe results from the CT scan corroborate the last hypothesis. \n\nFigure 5-15 is a 3D rendition of the scans from the bonded joint. \n\nTransparency was turned on in the renderer to visualize the internal \n\nstructure of the bonded joint. Darker areas are voids in the adhesive \n\nlayer, meaning that a large percentage of this bonded joint is lacking \n\nadhesive. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-15 - 3D rendering of the CT images. Transparency is used to observe \n\nthe internal structure of the joint. Darker areas are voids in the adhesive layer. \n\n \n\nCross-sectional cuts of the bonded region also clearly show the \n\nlack of adhesive. In Figure 5-16 the voids are contoured in white.  \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-16 - Cross-sectional cuts of the adhesive bonded joint. Voids are \n\ncontoured in white. \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, no optical fiber is seen in any of the last images. A \n\nzoomed in view of the cross-section (Figure 5-17) reveals that the fibers \n\nare too small to produce a discernible CT signal once inside the bonded \n\nregion. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-17 - Detail of the cross-section shows an optical fiber (indicated by the \n\narrow) entering the adhesive bond and vanishing soon after. \n\n \n\nIt is unfortunate that the CT images cannot be used to observe the \n\nposition of the fibers in detail. Nonetheless the images still contain a lot \n\nof information that can be compared to the strain maps. \n\n5.1.2 Specimen B \n\nTwo changes were made to the fibers embedding process to try to \n\nproduce a good quality bonded joint. \n\nThe first was a great increase in the amount of adhesive used. \n\nEach cartridge contains 50 ml of adhesive. In the first joint about 30 ml \n\nwere used and for the second one a full cartridge was applied. \n\nThe second change is related to the geometry of the spigot. The \n\nsudden change in diameter creates a large gap between the fiber and the \n\nspigot, as shown in Figure 5-18. In Figure 5-14 the FBGs under traction \n\nare the ones nearer to this gap, meaning this may be a contributing \n\nfactor. \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-18 - Gap between the fibers and the spigot due to the machining done \n\nto the spigot. \n\n \n\nThis problem was solved by cutting small grooves with a file to \n\nsmoothly conduct the fibers into the area that will be bonded (Figure \n\n5-19). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-19 - Grooves help to conduct the fibers smoothly, eliminating the gap \n\nseen in the previous image. \n\n \n\nThe strain field for this bonded joint, depicted in Figure 5-20 and \n\nFigure 5-21 has a more promising look. All sensors are experiencing \n\ncompressive strain and the field exhibits an approximate rotational \n\nsymmetry. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-20 - 3D plot with color bar of the cure strain distribution in the \n\nadhesive layer. Test specimen B. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-21 - Color plot of the cure strain distribution in the adhesive layer. Test \n\nspecimen B. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nThe prospect of a higher quality bonded joint is confirmed by the \n\nresults from the CT. The 3D rendering in Figure 5-22 is quite different \n\nfrom the previous specimen. There are no big voids like before, instead \n\nmany small pores can be observed. This is likely the result of entrapped \n\nvolatile compounds from the adhesive, since it has a sharp exothermal \n\ncurve and the bonded joint is an enclosed space.  \n\nIt is unlikely that a porosity free bonded joint can be \n\nmanufactured with the available materials, but since this does not seem \n\nto adversely affect the response of the sensors, this will be considered as \n\na good quality bonded joint for comparison purposes.  \n\nSince a good quality joint was achieved in the second try and this \n\nspecimen also doubles as a good instrumented joint for destructive \n\ntesting, the total number of required specimens can be reduced from the \n\noriginal seven to six. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-22 - 3D rendering of the CT images. Transparency is used to observe \n\nthe internal structure of the joint. Porosity is observed here instead of numerous \n\nlarge voids.  \n\n \n\nInn specimen B, the optical fibers remain invisible inside the \n\nbonded region, but it is possible to see how the grooves are producing \n\nthe expected results (Figure 5-23). \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n    \nFigure 5-23 \u2013 An optical fiber entering the adhesive layer in a test specimen \n\nwithout guiding grooves (left) and with guiding grooves (right). \n\n5.1.3 Specimen C \n\nHaving perfected and validated the bonded joint assembly \n\nmethod, the next logical step is to include planned defects for \n\ncomparison purposes. \n\nThree small inclusions (Figure 5-24), one circle with a diameter \n\nof approximately 20 mm, one square with 20 mm sides, and a 20 mm by \n\n70 mm rectangle were prepared. They consist of three layers of \n\naluminum tape, for better visibility in the CT imagens, and one layer of \n\nTeflon sheet for its low adherence. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-24 - Artificial inclusions made of aluminum tape and Teflon. \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\nThe inclusions were then fixed to the sleeve (Figure 5-25) by \n\napplying a small amount of instant cyanoacrylate glue around their \n\nedges. This will simulate three debonded regions with different sizes \n\nand geometries. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-25 - Inclusions bonded to the sleeve. \n\n \n\nAfter the joint assembly, the FBG sensors were read. Once more \n\nall sensors are under compressive strain, and while the strain field in \n\nFigure 5-26 has an overall shape similar to the one in Figure 5-20 some \n\nparticularities can be observed. \n\nThis is more evident in the color plot in Figure 5-27, where the \n\napproximate location of the defects is overlaid to the strain field. There \n\nis a clear difference around the area where the larger rectangular defect \n\nis expected to be, which is promising. \n\nOn the other hand, the smaller defects apparently did not produce \n\na significant enough change in the strain field to be evidently noticed. \n\nThis may be because they are overshadowed by the strain from the \n\nadhesive shrinkage. If this is the case they may show up in the \n\nhydrostatic tests in the next section. \n\nAll three inclusions are visible in the 3D rendered model back \n\nfrom the CT (Figure 5-28). \n\nThe exact position of the inclusions can be determined by looking \n\nat the cross-sectional cuts, such as the one in Figure 5-29. Their actual \n\nposition is very close to the ones shown in Figure 5-27. The adhesive \n\nlayer also seems to be even less porous in relation to test specimen B. \n\n \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-26 - 3D plot with color bar of the cure strain distribution in the \n\nadhesive layer.

All three inclusions can be seen; \n\nthey are indicated by arrows. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-29 - Cross sectional cut from the bonded joint of specimen C showing \n\nthe exact position of the inclusions (indicated by the arrows). \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n5.2 Defect Detection with Embedded Sensors \n\nHydrostatic testing requires the test specimens to be fully \n\nassembled. Internal pressure variation will also be used in the tests \n\ntogether with the digital shearography equipment (Figure 5-30). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-30 - Digital shearography equipment. A 300 mW single longitudinal \n\nmode 532 nm laser with expansion lenses (white arrow), and lateral shearing \n\ninterferometer with attached digital camera and objective lens (yellow arrow). \n\n \n\nSpecimen B was assembled with a second adhesive bonded joint \n\nfor the upcoming destructive test. There is no interest in performing \n\ndestructive tests with test specimen A and C, so both had the flanged \n\npipe piece solvent bonded to the vacant side of their sleeves.  \n\nA matching blind flange (Figure 5-31), with a \u00bc\u201d NPT thread for \n\nconnecting a manual hydraulic pump, was designed and machined out of \n\na 1040 steel plate to seal the test specimens.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-31 - Matching 1040 steel flange with 1/4\" NPT thread. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nFor the digital shearography tests the sleeves were painted mat \n\nwhite and divided in four equal areas. A small structure available in the \n\nlaboratory was used to keep the specimens in the vertical position. This \n\nstructure and the painted sleeve can be seen in Figure 5-32. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-32 - Test specimen B with the sleeve painted mat white and divided in \n\nfour equal areas. It is being kept in the vertical position by a metal structure and \n\nindustrial fabric belts. \n\n \n\nIt is important to notice that the sleeve has an internal stop at half \n\nthe way through (Figure 5-33). Since there will not be a pipe inserted in \n\nthis region, it is expected that this will produce a distinct fringe pattern \n\nin the shearography maps. \n\nFor the hydrostatic tests, the specimens were laid horizontally, \nsupported by the blind flange and the cap. Strain data will be acquired \n\nfor various internal pressure values and all ?? maps will use the zero \n\ninternal manometric internal pressure strain values as reference. \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\nFor a pristine joint, it is expected that when comparing strain \n\ndistribution from higher pressures in relation to zero, the result is a fully \n\ntractive ?? map. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-33 \u2013 A stop inside the sleeve. \n\n \n\nEven though the maximum internal pressure during this tests will \n\nnot exceed 8 bar (0.8 MPa) and this pipe is rated for 22 bar (2.2 MPa), a \n\nsmall protective chamber window was placed around the sleeve to avoid \n\nwater and oil spillage on nearby electronic devices in case of premature \n\nfailure of the bonded joints (Figure 5-34). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-34 - Setup for hydrostatic testing of the instrumented adhesive bonded \n\njoints. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Specimen A \n\nStrain distribution was mapped for internal manometric pressure \n\nfrom 0 bar to 7 bar, with 1 bar increments. As pressure increases, the \n\nshape of the strain distribution remains almost identical while strain \n\nvalues scale with the applied pressure (Figure 5-35). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 5-35 - 3D plot with color bar of ?? in the adhesive layer. Specimen A. \n\nInternal pressure variation: 2 bar (up) and 6 bar (down). \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nStrain distribution for specimen A is once again disarranged. No \n\nrotational symmetry is observed and various FBGs are experiencing \n\ncompressive strain, which is the opposite of what was expected for a \n\nflawless bonded joint. \n\nFigure 5-36 is the 2D color plot of the ?? map for a Internal \n\npressure variation of 7 bar. It has been divided in four areas that \n\ncorrespond to the ones in the surface of the sleeve for the digital \n\nshearography test. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-36 - Color plot of ?? in the adhesive layer. Test specimen A. Internal \n\npressure variation: 7 bar. \n\n \n\nArea 3 has the most uniform strain distribution, which indicates a \n\nlack of defects. The FBGs in the upper portion of area 4 are compressed, \n\nhinting at the presence of a defect near the stop by the middle of the \n\nsleeve. Areas 1 and 2 have compressed FBGs where the fibers enter the \n\nadhesive layer. This result will be compared to the shearograms to \n\nverify if the defect indicatives match. \n\nFigure 5-37 shows how the shearography equipment sees the test \n\nspecimen. The double image is a result of the lateral shearing \n\ninterferometer. The dashed square to the right is the adhesive bonded \n\nregion of the sleeve, with the embedded sensors. The dashed square to \n\nthe left is the solvent bonded region. The space between them contains \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nthe sleeve\u2019s stop. The axis labeled as \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 correspond respectively \n\nto the horizontal and vertical axis in Figure 5-36. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-37 - Double image of area 1 as seen by the camera of the shearography \n\nequipment. \n\n \n\nAll shearograms in this chapter will follow the conventions \n\ndefined in Figure 5-36. \n\nFrom the fringe maps in Figure 5-38, Figure 5-39, Figure 5-40 \n\nand Figure 5-41, it is clear that the sleeve\u2019s stop creates a divide in the \n\nfringe maps, creating two distinct strain fields that must be analyzed \n\nseparately. This distinction is necessary since the fringes around this \n\narea are very similar to the ones caused by an internal defect, such as the \n\nones in Figure 2-20 and Figure 2-21. \n\nIn the shearograms, the areas were disturbances in the fringe \n\npatterns indicate the presence of defects are delimited by red dashed \n\nrectangles. \n\nThe shearograms for area 1 (Figure 5-38) and area 2 (Figure \n\n5-39) exhibit signs of sub-surface defects in the outermost side of the \n\nadhesive bonded region, in agreeance to the defect indications from the \n\nstrain map. The fringes interpretation will be more understandable after \n\nreading the next section and comparing the results. \nArea 3 shearogram (Figure 5-40) has an almost uniform fringe \n\npattern. A small defect that does not appear in the strain map was \n\ndetected in the lower right region of the bonded joint. \n\nx\n \n\ny\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nArea 4 shearogram (Figure 5-41) is also in accordance to the \n\nstrain map, indicating the presence of defects in the upper half of the \n\nbonded region. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-38 - Shearogram of area 1. Test specimen A. Internal pressure \n\nvariation in relation to the reference phase map: 1 bar. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-39 - Shearogram of area 2. Test specimen A. Internal pressure \n\nvariation in relation to the reference phase map: 1 bar. \n\n \n\nThere is a good correlation between the strain field measured \n\nwith the FBGs and the fringe maps. Regions with sensors under \n\ncompressive strain also exhibit disturbances in the corresponding fringe \n\nA\n1\n\n \nA\n\n2\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nmaps that confirms the presence of defects. The only exception is the \n\nsmall defect in area 3 that was not detected by the FBGs. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-40 - Shearogram of area 3. Test specimen A. Internal pressure \n\nvariation in relation to the reference phase map: 1 bar. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-41- Shearogram of area 4. Test specimen A.  Internal pressure \n\nvariation in relation to the reference phase map: 1 bar. \n\n5.2.2 Specimen B \n\nAs with specimen A, strain distribution was mapped for internal \n\nmanometric pressure from 0 bar to 7 bar, with 1 bar increments. \n\nSimilarly, the shape of the strain distribution remains almost identical \n\nwhile strain values scale with the applied pressure (Figure 5-42). \n\nA\n3\n\n \nA\n\n4\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\nIn comparison to test specimen A, the strain distribution is much \n\nmore uniform. All FBGs are under tensile strain and a good amount of \n\nrotational symmetry can be observed. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 5-42 - 3D plot with color bar of ?? in the adhesive layer. Specimen B. \n\nInternal pressure variation: 2 bar (up) and 6 bar (down). \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\nA few FBGs stand out with significantly lower strain levels, this \n\nis more evident Figure 5-43. Looking at Figure 5-42 and Figure 5-43 it  \n\nseems that the anomalous readings are symmetric in relation to fiber 7.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-43 \u2013 Color plot of ?? in the adhesive layer. Test specimen B. Internal \n\npressure variation: 7 bar. \n\n \n\nThis lead to the suspicion that supporting the test specimen by the \n\nflange and the cap introduced a flexural loading in the sleeve that \n\nchanged due to pressure stiffening of the pipe. To test this hypothesis \n\nthe test specimen was rotated by 90\u00ba around its axis. If the hypothesis \n\nhold, the perceived symmetry will shift laterally in the strain map. \n\nFigure 5-44 is the resulting strain distribution after the rotation, \n\nfor a Internal pressure variation of 7 bar. The new strain map is almost \n\nidentical to the previous, the pressure stiffening hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAs the results from the CT scan do not exhibit large defects it is possible \n\nto propose that this behavior is a result of pores near those sensors. \n\nThe information obtained by rotating the test specimen, however, \n\ncan still be used for an interesting analysis of the flexural strain in the \nsleeve. The plots in Figure 5-45 and Figure 5-46 were obtained by \n\ncomparing the strain field for an internal pressure of 7 bar before and \n\nafter the test specimen was rotated. These flexural strain maps are very \n\nsmooth and highly symmetrical, showing no evidence of defects. \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-44 - Color plot of ?? in the adhesive layer after rotating test specimen \n\nB.

They all do not exhibit \n\ndisturbances in the fringe patterns as seen in the Specimen A \n\nshearograms. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-47 - Shearogram of area 1. Test specimen B.

The \n\nshape of the strain distribution remains almost identical while strain \n\nvalues scale increase in accordance with the applied pressure (Figure \n\n5-51). In comparison to previous specimens the strain distribution is the \n\nsmoothest one, possibly a reflex of the reduced porosity.  \n\nTwo of the planned defects were clearly detected by the sensors: \n\nThe large rectangle in area 4 (Figure 5-52) that spans from fiber 0 to \n\nhalf-way through fiber 1 and 2, and the circle that coincides with fiber 4. \n\nThe square insert, placed between fibers 6 and 7, was not detected by \n\nthe FBGs.  \n\nTest specimen C was also rotated around its axis to see how the \n\nplanned defects affect the flexural strain distribution. The large \n\nrectangle still produce a visible disturbance in the flexural strain map \n\n(Figure 5-53), but the smaller defects are not seen. \n\nDigital shearography (Figure 5-54, Figure 5-55, Figure 5-56 and \n\nFigure 5-57) also did not detect the smaller inserts. The large rectangle \n\nappears clearly in the shearogram of area 4 (Figure 5-57) and a small \n\npart of it is still visible in area 1 (Figure 5-54). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n4\n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 5-51 - 3D plot with color bar of ?? in the adhesive layer.

The 10 FBG chain was bonded to the surface of the sleeve \n\nusing the methyl methacrylate adhesive.  \n\nCounting from the FC/APC connector, FBGs 1 and 2 are located \n\nby the borders of the large rectangle, while FBG 10 is directly on top of \n\nit after the fiber wraps around (Figure 5-58). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-58 \u2013 FBGs 1, 2 and 10 bonded around the large rectangular insert. \n\n \n\nFBG 5 was bonded on top of the small square insert (Figure \n\n5-59). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-59 \u2013 FBG 5 bonded directly on top of the small square insert. The \n\ndirection of the strain sensitivity of the FBG is indicated by the red arrow. \n\n \n\nAnd FBGs 7 and 8 were bonded close by the small circle insert \n\n(Figure 5-60). \n\nFBG 1 \n\nFBG 2 \n\nFBG 10 \n\nFBG 5 \n\n? \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-60 - FBGs 7 and 8 on both sides of the small circle insert. \n\n \n\nThe test specimen was then pressurized up to 8 bar and the 10 \n\nFBGs were interrogated every 1 bar. To evaluate if the FBGs placed \n\naround the inserts could detect the internal defects based on the \n\ncircumferential strain distribution on the outer surface of the sleeve, \n\nlook at the strain profile at 8 bar (Figure 5-61).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-61 \u2013 A closer look at the circumferential strain profile for an internal \n\nInternal pressure variation of 8 bar. The dashed lines near the horizontal axis \n\nshows the approximate position of the inserts in relation to the FBGs. \n\n \n\nThe evolution of the strain profile along the 10 FBG chain can be \n\nseen in Figure 5-62. Non-uniformities become more evident at higher \n\npressures. \n\nFBG 8 \n\nFBG 7 \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-62 \u2013 Evolution of the circumferential strain profile along a single line in the outer surface of the sleeve at the adhesive \n\nbonded joint. \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\nFBGs 1, 5, and 10 are all close to defects and appear to be \n\nsubjected to lower strain values. It is possible to use a hypothesis test to \n\ndetermine if they can be considered different from the other points. [85] \n\nThe mean strain ?? of the other 7 FBGs is 500.83 ?m/m. The null \nhypothesis ?0 and alternative hypothesis ?1 can be defined as: \n\n \n\n?0: ???1, ???5, ???10 = ??  \n?1: ???1, ???5, ???10 &lt;?? \n\n \n\nThe standard deviation ?? of ?? is 17.95 ?m/m. For a significance \nlevel ? of 0.05, and 6 degrees of freedom, the test statistic ? as given by \nEquation 5.3 must be smaller than the critical value ???,6 = ?1.943.  \n\n ? =\n? ? ??\n\n??\n \n\n \n(5.3) \n\nThe higher value of ? will occur for ???5 since it has the highest \nstrain value of the 3 tested FBGs. Substituting the values of  ??, ?? and \n\n???5 = 458.27 ??/? in equation 5.3 returns ? = ?2.37. \n?0 is then rejected and all three strain measurements can be \n\nconsidered different from the mean strain value for a 95% confidence \n\nlevel. \n\n5.3 Instrumentation Impact on Joint Pressure Rating \n\nIn the manufacturer\u2019s product guide, all 4\u201d CPVC pipes and \n\nfittings, except 45\u00ba elbows, have an operating pressure rating of 22 bar \n\n(2.2 MPa) @ 20 \u00baC. However, it was not disclosed that the flanges \n\noperating pressure rating is 150 psi (1.03 MPa). \n\nWith such lower pressure rating, the test specimen is much more \n\nlikely to fail at the flange. As this will probably lead to inconclusive \n\nexperiments, no more test specimens were assembled for destructive \n\ntesting. Only Specimen B was pressurized until failure. This concludes \n\nthe explanation on why only three out of the originally planned seven \n\ntest specimens were fully assembled. \n\nFor the destructive test, specimen B was placed inside a steel pipe \n\nfastened to the ladder of a small bunker under Labmetro (Figure 5-63). \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-63 - Test specimen B inside a steel pipe fastened to a ladder. \n\n \n\nDuring the test, the entrance to the bunker was sealed using its \n\nown concrete trapdoor (Figure 5-64).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-64 \u2013 Concrete trapdoor sealing the entrance to the bunker. \n\n \n\nThe test specimen was then pressurized until it failed at the \n\ninternal pressure of 60 bar. The FBGs were interrogated every 5 bar. \n\nUpon reaching 25 bar, 40 bar and 50 bar the manometric pressure was \n\nbrought down to 0 bar. Comparing the strain field at the zeroes can \n\nshow the buildup of residual strain. \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\nFigure 5-65 and Figure 5-66 show strain maps in the adhesive \n\nlayer for various pressure levels.

Differently from \n\nexisting solutions that focus on regularly scheduled maintenance, the \n\napproach proposed here aims to be compatible with long-term \n\nmonitoring. \n\nA simple and well known optical fiber sensor was selected and a \n\nsensing strategy based on ?? maps, similarly to optical interferometry \n\ntechniques such as shearography and holography, was applied. \n\nThe objectives set on the first chapter: studying and selecting \n\nsensors, elaborating an integrated sensing strategy and evaluating both \n\nthe sensors and sensing strategy have all been fulfilled. \n\nThe following sections summarize the capabilities and limitations \n\nof the method that has been proposed and tested, along with presenting \n\nsuggestions to further develop this study. \n\n6.1 Performance of the Proposed Method \n\nFrom the results exposed in Chapter 5 it is evident that the \n\nproposed method is capable of detecting internal defects in adhesive \n\nbonded joints. \n\nWhile the sensors embedded into the adhesive layer could not \n\ndetect all three defects purposely introduced into test specimen C, the \n\ncombined approach of embedding and wrapping sensors could. \n\nThe results obtained from the optical fiber sensors were in \n\nagreeance with the much more detailed computed tomography scans, \n\nwhich is a technique with severe limitations for in field applications. \n\nThey were also on par with shearography for detecting larger defects \n\nand was able to detect the smaller defects that did not appear in the \n\nshearograms. \n\nEven while focusing only on joint assemble and long-term \n\nmonitoring, the method proved itself to be effective for monitoring the \n\npipeline assembly process by providing a detailed flexural strain profile. \n\nThe sensors can be used during this stage to monitor if excessive loads \n\nwere introduced in the joints when misalignments are corrected by \n\nforce.  \n\nBy mapping ?? instead of absolute strain values, the method \n\nallows all stages of the pipeline lifecycle to be monitored independently \n\nby keeping strain comparisons intra-stage only. \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\n6.2 Sensing Strategy Limitations \n\nIt is important to know that this approach is not able to reject, or \n\napprove, an inspected bonded joint per the criteria defined by the \n\nstandards cited in section 4.1.2, as the FBGs are quasi single-point strain \n\nsensors and the standards reject a joint based on total defect area. \n\nThe tests with planned defects showed that the FBGs are very \n\ngood at detecting voids and debonded areas when directly adjacent to \n\nthem, but a defect resting between fibers can go undetected. \n\nA solid sensing coverage is possibly the most important aspect to \n\nconsider when utilizing this method, otherwise defects can remain \n\nunnoticed. \n\n6.3 Suggestions for Future Advancements \n\n6.3.1 Tensile Testing \n\nThe pressure rating of the plastic flanges undermined the \n\nexecution of destructive tests. Although the failure occurring away from \n\nthe embedded fibers is positive, only one destructive test does not bear \n\nenough statistical significance to conclude that the embedded sensors \n\nhave no deleterious effects in the mechanical strength of the joint. \n\nOne way to utilize the material already acquired for this \n\ndissertation is to substitute the hydrostatic test for a tensile test. The \n\nmechanical engineering department of Federal University of Santa \n\nCatarina is equipped with a 300 kN tensile testing machine, more than \n\nenough to lead the CPVC pipes to failure. An ASTM D2105 tensile grip \n\nor similar can be procured and used to fix the test specimens to the \n\nmachine. \n\n6.3.2 Fibers per Joint versus Joint Strength \n\nWith the proper means to extensively execute destructive tests, it \n\nwould be interesting to evaluate how the number of embedded sensors \n\naffects the strength of the bonded joints. This information can be used to \n\nobtain the best sensing coverage with minimal intrusiveness.  \n\n6.3.3 More Sensors in a Single Fiber \n\nFor an even better coverage the number of sensors per fiber can \n\nbe increased. Three FBGs already have produced very good results for \n\nan insertion depth of 57 mm. \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nFrom this perspective, the best may be making use of distributed \n\nstrain sensing with OFDR. The entire fiber can be used as a cheap \n\ndistributed sensor, with the downside of requiring a more complex \n\ninterrogation scheme. \n\n6.3.4 Temperature Compensation for Field Testing \n\nHaving an instrumented pipeline in the field can provide a lot of \n\ninvaluable data, but a few problems must be solved before this can be \n\nattempted successfully. \n\nThe most important point is temperature compensation. In the \n\nlaboratory it is easy to make temperature a non-issue by keeping it \n\nconstant during all tests. Without temperature compensation pure strain \n\ndata cannot be extracted from the sensors. \n\nChapter 3 already covers a few fiber optic sensors with multi-\n\nparameter capabilities and many more can be found in specialized \n\nliterature. From the ones cited in chapter 3, the thermochromic coating \n\nseems to be the easiest to adapt to the current sensing strategy. \n\n6.3.5 Ruggedness for Long-Term Monitoring \n\nField employed sensors need to be very robust if long-term \n\nmonitoring capability is desired. \n\nThere is ample variety of buffer coating material available, \n\nincluding organically modified ceramics and metallic coatings that can \n\nprovide a better protection against constant exposure to UV light and \n\nhumidity. Rugged fiber connectors are also available, some even with IP \n\n68 ratings and salt mist tolerance. Armored fiber optic patch cords and \n\ncables are already widespread. \n\nSubmarine optical fiber communications technology can provide \n\nlots of useful information and design choices for increased ruggedness. \n\n6.3.6 Annealing of the FBGs \n\nThe periodic modulation of the refractive index of the FBG \n\ndecays with time. This decay results in a change of grating reflectivity \n\nand nominal Bragg wavelength, which in turn will lead to measurement \n\nerrors in long-term monitoring applications. \nAnnealing is a powerful and simple technique to greatly increase \n\nthe stability of the periodic modulation. References [86] and [87] \n\nprovide more details on how to anneal FBGs written in regular fibers \n\nand in hydrogen loaded fibers. \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] DE TARSO R.
