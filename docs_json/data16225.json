However, this process is dependent on obtaining water samples with suspended \nsediments to calibrate the turbidimeter. Sampling can be carried out through different \nmethods, resulting in errors and uncertainties in estimating the SSC. Four different \npossibilities for the composition of the calibration curve were tested in order to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the turbidimeter calibration for different sampling strategies. The study was \nconducted in 2012 and 2013 in two catchments in southern Brazil that had a strong sediment \nyield impact. The results indicate that sampling during rainfall events generate a significant \nand representative SSC for the turbidimeter calibration. The use of an integrating sampler \nfor synthetic samples provides an effective calibration, but overestimates SSC compared to \ncalibration from rainfall event sampling. The samples collected at fixed intervals - weekly \nand daily - generated an insufficient amount of data and are not representative of real \nsediment concentrations of the catchments.\n\nEstrat\u00e9gias de amostragem para estimar a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o\nde sedimentos em suspens\u00e3o para a calibra\u00e7\u00e3o do turbid\u00edmetro\nR E S U M O\nO fluxo de sedimentos em rios pode ser medido continuamente com o uso de turbid\u00edmetro, \npela rela\u00e7\u00e3o indireta entre turbidez da \u00e1gua e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos em suspens\u00e3o \n(CSS).

Bras. Eng. Agr\u00edc. Ambiental, v.21, n.12, p.884-889, 2017.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTurbidimetr y has been widely used for monitoring \nsuspended solid discharges. It represents an additional and \nefficient option to overcome the limitations of traditional \nsusp ende d s e diment concent rat ion (SSC) monitor ing \n(Pavanelli &amp; Bigi, 2005). Turbidity is the transparency level of \na solution that contains suspended and dissolved substances \n(Slaets et al., 2014) that causes light to be scattered instead of \npassing through the solution in a straight line. Thus, the higher \nthe intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity level. \n\nTurbidimeter calibration with samples of suspended \nsediment representing the location is important because the \nspectral responses obtained by turbidity sensors have no \nuniversal connection with the SSC (Mylvaganam &amp; Jakobsen, \n2001). The relationship between turbidity and SSC depends \non the different characteristics of suspended sediment, such \nas grain size (Merten et al., 2014), color, and mineralogy of the \nsediments (Rai &amp; Kumar, 2015). The particle size in transport \nvaries with the hydraulic characteristics of the flow, erosive \nprocesses, geomorphological and lithological conditions of the \ncatchment, and presence of vegetation (Slattery &amp; Burt, 1997; \nLenzi &amp; Marchi, 2000). \n\nThe same material that is transported by the flow must be \nused for the turbidimeter calibration, and the samples obtained \nmust have the same amplitude of the SSC that may occur in \nthe flow, to avoid the extrapolation of the calibration curve. \nThis is main obstacle in a successful calibration. \n\nDifferent strategies have been employed to obtain SSC \nsamples for turbidimeter calibration to overcome this \nproblem (Minella et al., 2008), for example, use soil from the \ncatchment, fine sediments collected from the deposits, and \nsediments transported during the rainfall events for calibration. \nAccording to Lewis (2002), sampling during various rainfall \nevents is required due to differences that may exist among \ntransported material from different rainfall events. \n\nD i f fe re nt  S S C  s ampl i ng  st r ate g i e s  we re  te ste d  for \nturbidimeter calibration to demonstrate the differences in \nSSC estimation, depending on how calibration samples were \nacquired. Sampling was carried out based on rainfall events \nwith fixed schedules (daily and weekly), as well as use of \ntime-integrated samplers. While taking into consideration \nthe impact on monitoring costs and estimate quality, the \nconvenience of using a time-integrated sampler and daily \nand weekly samplings were evaluated in comparison with the \nsamples collected during the rainfall events.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThis study was conducted with turbidimeters monitoring \ngauge stations installed in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o River (28\u00b0 27\u2019 22\u201d S; \n53\u00b0 58\u2019 24\u201d W) and in the Guapor\u00e9 River (28\u00b0 54\u2019 41\u201d S; \n51\u00b0 57\u2019 10\u201d W) in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, southern \nBrazil (Figure 1), in 2012 and 2013. \n\nT h e  C on c e i \u00e7 \u00e3 o  c atch m e nt  h a s  a  d r ai n age  are a  of \napproximately 800 km2 and is characterized by dairy farming \nand grain production. The annual average precipitation in the \n\nregion is 1,750 to 2,000 mm. The topography of the region \nis characterized by low steepness (6-9%) on top and middle \npart of the hillslope, and higher steepness (10-14%) near the \ndrainage channels. The soils of this catchment were classified \nas Ultisols, Alfisols and Oxisols. These soils are basaltic and \nwell developed, thus exhibiting high amounts of clay and \niron oxides. Therefore, the sediment produced is reddish and \npresents small average particle diameter. The average SSC of \nthe Concei\u00e7\u00e3o River during base flow is 16 mg L-1, and \n110 mg L-1 during the high flow. Despite the soil of the region \nis mainly managed in the no-tillage system, rills and gullies \nare found in cultivated areas and roads.\n\nThe Guapor\u00e9 river catchment is located in the northeastern \nregion of Rio Grande do Sul, with an area of approximately \n2,000 km2, with heterogeneous landscape and soil management. \nThe climate, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification is Cfb, super \nhumid subtropical, mesothermic, with cool summers, no dry \nseason and severe frosts. The annual average precipitation is \n1,400 to 2,000 mm. The soils of this catchment were classified \nas Ultisols, Oxisols, Entisols and Luvisol. These soils are \nbasaltic and very diverse due to the different landforms of the \nlandscape. This diversity is also due to the varied particle sizes \ntransported, since there are well developed soils with deep \nprofile and young soils with shallow profile. Slopes and shallow \nsoils, combined with non-use of soil conservation practices, \npromote erosion, generating significant amount of surface \nrunoff and high soil loss rates in most part of this catchment. \nThere are gentle slopes and deep soils in the upper third of the \nGuapor\u00e9 catchment, but hillsides are long, and few grooves \nmay form by water erosion in no-tillage areas.\n\nRain gauges, sensor depth and turbidimeter were used \nto monitor rainfalls, flow discharge and sediment flux, \nrespectively. The mathematical relation between turbidity \noutput in millivolt (mV) and nephelometric turbidity units \n(NTU) was performed using a solution of polymers (polymer \nbead calibration solutions). The calibration with the solution \nused the points 0 (distilled water), 40, 100, 400, 800, 1000 and \n3000 NTU. The sensor was subjected to different concentrations \n\nSource: TOPODATA (2011)\n\nFigure 1. Location of the catchment monitored\n\n\n\n886 Leandro Dalbianco et al.\n\nR. Bras. Eng. Agr\u00edc. Ambiental, v.21, n.12, p.884-889, 2017.\n\nof the standard solution (from the lowest to the highest \nconcentration) and 20 signals emitted by the sensor (in mV) \nwere recorded, which were then converted into means for each \nconcentration. A regression curve that converts mV into NTU \nwas established. This analysis was used to the operation of the \nequipment and defining its linearity, repeatability and accuracy. \n\nTurbidity (NTU) were correlated with the corresponding \nSSC (mg L-1), testing four mathematical relations:\n\n(i) SSC-NTU using a time-integrated sampler to collect \nsediment samples;\n\n(ii) SSC-NTU using suspended sediment samples collected \nduring the rainfalls;\n\n(iii) SSC-NTU using daily-suspended sediment samples;\n(iv) SSC-NTU using weekly-suspended sediment samples.\n\nSSC-NTU using a time-integrated sampler to collect \nsediment samples\n\nStation time-integrated samplers were installed in each \ngauge station for sample collection. These sampler devices \nare easy to manufacture and are installed close to the river \nbed to collect sediments for a certain period of time, which \ncan range from weeks to months, depending on the quantity \nof material transported in suspension. The construction was \nbased on the sampler described by Phillips et al. (2000), using \n7.5-cm diameter and 80-cm long PVC (polyvinyl polychloride) \npipes, with caps with holes and 4-mm diameter pipes in both \nends. The physical principle of operation is the small flow \nrate from the sampler favoring sediment settling, including \nclay particles. The samplers were submerged for a period of \nthree months and then removed and taken to the laboratory \nto compose the different SSC. \n\nThe samples were dried in a forced-air circulation oven \nat 60 \u00b0C, and then the organic material was oxidized with \nhydrogen peroxide and dispersed with 60 mL of sodium \nhydroxide solution at 1%, followed by mechanical stirring \nfor 12 h. Finally, the solutions were placed in black plastic \nbottles to avoid light interference at the time of calibration. \nThe concentrations used were 0, 10, 40, 100, 300, 600, 1000, \n1500 and 3000 mg L-1, and 20 NTU turbidity readings (replicate \nmeasurements) were performed for each concentration, which \ngenerally had little or small standard deviation. These 20 \nreadings were converted into a single mean NTU used in the \nNTU-SSC mathematical relation. \n\nSSC-NTU using suspended sediment samples collected \nduring the rainfalls\n\nSuspension sediment samples were collected during the \nrainfalls close to the in-situ turbidimeter (Table 1) using \n\na hand-held isokinetic sampler USDH-48. Samples were \ncollected during the rising and falling hydrograph limb. \n\nSuspended sediment samples were analysed in a laboratory \nusing the evaporation method (Shreve &amp; Downs, 2005) to \ndetermine the SSC. The SSC obtained in each sample was \ncorrelated with the turbidity (NTU).\n\nSSC-NTU using daily-suspended sediment samples\nDaily suspended sediment samples were collected by local \n\nobserver using an isokinetic sampler, similar to the USDH \n48. The observer recorded date and time and identified the \nsamples for subsequent correspondence with the turbidity data \n(NTU). The samples were properly stored and weekly sent to \nthe laboratory to determine the SSC, as describe before. Daily \nSSC were correlated with the daily turbidity. \n\nSSC-NTU using weekly-suspended sediment \nSuspended sediment samples were collected every week \n\nusing an isokinetic sampler, similar to the USDH 48 and sent \nto the laboratory to evaluate the SSC, as describe before. Thus, \nonce a week a field campaign was carried out to sample the SSC.\n\nData analysis\nIn addition to the SSC analysis, the grain size of the \n\nsamples was analysed to determine the average particle \nsize of the samples collected with the SSC time-integrated \nsampler and during one rainfall event monitored in the two \ncatchments. The average particle size (d50 in micrometers) was \ndetermined by the method of laser beam diffraction, using a \nlaser granulometer. The method of particle size analysis also \ninvolved the burning of organic matter, chemical dispersion \nwith sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and mechanical dispersion \nfor a period of 12 h, before read by the laser granulometer \n(Beckman Coulter LS 13 320). \n\nThe data pairs (turbidity-SSC) were plotted and fitted to the \nmost appropriate regression equation for the nature of the data \nin all sampling strategies. Differences between the sampling \nmethods and possible interferences was also analysed. \n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFor samples collected daily, 191 SSC samples were collected \nin the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and 171 SSC samples in the Guapor\u00e9 \ncatchment. In the case of weekly samples, 15 pairs of data in \nthe Concei\u00e7\u00e3o catchment and 17 in the Guapor\u00e9 catchment \nwere used to develop the regression equation. It should be \nnoted that between December 2011 and June 2012 there was \na severe drought in the region without the occurrence of \nsignificant rainfall events. \n\nFigure 2 shows the four mathematical regression between \nSSC-NTU. The results obtained in the calibration performed \nwith samples of suspended sediment collected by time-\nintegrated samplers were fitted to a second-degree polynomial \nequation, with R2 = 1.00 (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o) and 0.98 (Guapor\u00e9) \n(Figure 2A). The advantage of using synthetic samples from the \ntime-integrated sampler is to prepare high SSC that in many \nrainfall events are not possible to be reached.\n\nThe mathematical relation SSC-NTU using suspended \nsediment samples collected during rainfall events is illustrated * Occurrence of rainfall events with soil moisture near saturation due to prior rainfall\n\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o catchment Guapor\u00e9 catchment\n\nDate Precipitation (mm) Date Precipitation (mm)\n07/21/11 109.4* 08/09/11 100.5\n\n10/01/11 50.0 08/29/11 44.6*\n\n10/08/11 61.9 07/06/12 106.9\n\n07/05/12 72.0\n\nTable 1.

Suspended sediment concentration - SSC Calibration curves for two experimental catchments under different \nsampling strategies: (A) with time integrated sampler, (B) collections in rainfall events, and weekly (C) and daily (D) collections\n\nin Figure 2B. Despite large magnitude rainfall events were \nmonitored, the maximum SSC did not exceed 600 mg L-1 in \neither location. The data of both turbidimeters were fitted to \na linear equation. According to the Figure 2C and D, the SSC \nof the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Guapor\u00e9 catchments was similar and the \nturbidity was greater in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. Despite the difference \nfound in the particle size carried in suspension, it is unlikely \nthat it affected the scattering of light emitted by the sensor (Rai \n&amp; Kumar, 2015). Other interfering factors not accounted for in \nthis study may have caused the difference found, for example, \ncolor and mineralogy of the soil from each catchment. In the \nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o catchment, relief is gentle and wavy, and climate is \nwarmer and humid, which favors the development of soils with \ndeep profile, red soils with lots of clay minerals 1:1 (kaolinite) \nand iron oxides. These aspects should be explored in future \nresearches. \n\nThe particle size (d50) in the time-integrated sampler \nstrategy was 11.94 (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o) and 13.21 ?m (Guapor\u00e9); and \nin the strategy of sampling by rainfall events the d50 was 5.13 \n(07/20/2011) and 6.59 (07/21/2011) for Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Guapor\u00e9 \n\ncatchments, respectively. The granulometric analysis showed \ntwo important aspects: the differences between the catchments \nare not sufficient to explain the differences in the turbidity \nsignal recorded on the calibration charts, and the rainfall event \nsampling exhibit d50 significantly lower, indicating that the \nsampler is not completely effective in retaining fine sediments. \nIt is expected that in this case, a mathematical relation curve \nfor rainfall event samples would have smaller inclination angle, \nsince particles of larger size compared to smaller particles (time \nintegrated sampler x rainfall event sampling, and samples from \nthe Guapor\u00e9 x Concei\u00e7\u00e3o) in a same concentration generate a \nsmaller backscatter (Figure 3) (Merten et al., 2014). \n\nThe amplitude of SSC was small in the weekly sampling \n(Figure 2C). The maximum SSC did not exceed 25 mg L-1, \nexcept for a sample from the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o catchment, with 89 mg L-1. \nHowever, there is a high degree of uncertainty for establishing \na regression curve when having only one sample at the end of \nthe curve, thus, this data was not presented in the graph (Figure \n2C). The results of this timescale is little used, since most \nsediment yield occurs during flooding when the concentration \n\ny = 0.003x2 + 1.317x - 19.759    R2 = 1.0\ny = 0.007x2 + 2.307x - 45.795    R2 = 0.976\n\ny = 1.058x - 28.246    R2 = 0.693\ny = 2.108x - 94.462    R2 = 0.808\n\ny = 0.590x - 3.045    R2 = 0.870\ny = 0.549x - 13.835    R2 = 0.705\n\ny = 1.163x - 30.458    R2 = 0.826\ny = 0.502x - 1.050    R2 = 0.707\n\nSS\nC\n\n (m\ng \n\nL\n-1\n)\n\nSS\nC\n\n (m\ng \n\nL\n-1\n)\n\nSS\nC\n\n (m\ng \n\nL\n-1\n)\n\nSS\nC\n\n (m\ng \n\nL\n-1\n)\n\n\n\n888 Leandro Dalbianco et al.\n\nR.

Date of sampling of the different sampling strategies from the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Guapor\u00e9 catchments (A), and \nfinancial costs of the SSC sampling strategies for the period of one year (B)\n\nof sediment is much greater than the magnitude obtained by \nthis scale. These samplings occurred during a period of low \nrainfall, which may explain the low concentration of suspended \nsediments, with predominance of dissolved solid (&lt;0.45 ?m) \nfractions during this collection period. The range of SSC in \ndaily sampling (Figure 2D) was higher than that in the weekly \nsampling, but it did not exceed 200 mg L-1, except for one \nsample from Concei\u00e7\u00e3o catchment, which presented SCC of \n720 mg L-1, and was also not shown in the graph (Figure 2D). \n\nThe data in Figure 2 were organized differently to indicate \ndifferences and limitations found in the methods (Figures 4A \nand B). It appears that the calibration with sediments, obtained \nusing the integrated sampler, overestimates SSC compared with \nthe other calibrations, perhaps by the effect of the reduction in \nthe backscatter from coarser sediments in higher proportion. \nDifferences in magnitude of SSC not contemplated by weekly \nand daily sampling became evident in Figures 4A and B. \n\nFinally, Figure 5A describes the SSC sampler calendar \nfor rainfall event, daily and weekly. Four rainfall events were \nmonitored at the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o gauge station, where 82 SSC \n\nsamples were collected. In the Guapor\u00e9 catchment, three \nrainfall events were monitored and 35 samples were collected. \nDespite the small number of rainfall events, the collected \nsamples covered a wide range of SSC. \n\nThe financial cost of all SSC sampling strategies was also \nanalyzed, such as researchers' daily expenses, transportation \n(700 km round trip), construction of SSC samplers, and SSC \nsample analysis (Figure 5B). The daily collections appear to \nhave higher cost, followed by weekly collections and rainfall \nevents. Collections with time-integrated samplers had much \nlower costs than the other strategies. \n\nTaking into account the costs and benefits of each sampling \nstrategy, the use of daily and weekly sampling is not advantageous. \nThese samplings present high cost and low efficiency, since the \namplitude of SSC is not satisfactory to construct a calibration \ncurve, requiring extrapolation to samples with higher turbidity, \nincreasing the chances of error. The costs of sampling rainfall \nevents are high, but the information obtained has great reliability, \nwith a good amplitude of SSC data and sediment characteristics \n\n\n\n889Sampling strategies to estimate suspended sediment concentration for turbidimeter calibration\n\nR.

Furthermore, according \nto Lewis (1996), few pairs of data (less than 10) representing \nthe SSC interval should be sufficient to establish a reliable \nrelationship between turbidity and SSC during these rainfall \nevents. The use of a time-integrated sampler presented lower \ncost but differences in comparison to rainfall event sampling, \nhowever, it is a reasonable alternative for obtaining samples for \nrainfall event calibration in situations of financial constraint and \nalso as a supplementary method. It should be noted that rainfall \nevent monitoring is essential and irreplaceable, both for the \nturbidimeter calibration and sediment concentration analysis. \n\nConclusions\n\n1. The use of turbidity to estimate suspended sediment \nconcentrations is affected by the calibration methodology.\n\n2. Sampling on weekly and daily scales does not provide a \nrange of concentrations representative of sediment transport \nin the monitored rivers. Moreover, these sampling methods \nhave high costs of monitoring and analysis.\n\n3. The calibration strategy using time-integrated samplers \nand rainfall events are complementary to each other and enable a \ncorrect calibration of turbidimeters and calibration tests regarding \nthe effect of interfering factors (size, color and mineralogy).\n\nLiterature Cited\n\nBouchez, J.; Gaillardet, J.; France?Lanord, C.; Maurice, L.; Dutra?Maia, \nP.
