A alta press\u00e3o hidrost\u00e1tica (HHP) \u00e9 uma das \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas mais importantes para a vida neste ambiente; no \n\nentanto os seus efeitos nos processos e estruturas dos organismos s\u00e3o \n\npouco compreendidos. Enquanto a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de testes com organismos \n\ndo fundo do mar \u00e9 muito desafiadora e cara, avaliar os efeitos da HHP \n\nutilizando esp\u00e9cies de \u00e1guas rasas parece ser a melhor abordagem. O \n\ncamar\u00e3o Palaemon varians \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie com estreita rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfilogen\u00e9tica com algumas esp\u00e9cies-chave do mar profundo. No presente \n\nestudo, P. varians foi exposto a uma gama de diferentes HHP (10, 20, 30 \n\ne 40 MPa) e a duas temperaturas diferentes (4 \u00baC e 20 \u00baC), e diversos \n\nmarcadores bioqu\u00edmicos (as actividades de AChE, GST e CAT e os n\u00edveis \n\nde LPO) foram medidos a fim de avaliar a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie como \n\nmodelo para estudos a desenvolver em laborat\u00f3rio. Todos os animais \n\nexpostos a HHP acima de 20 MPa morreram durante a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nEmbora nenhuma intera\u00e7\u00e3o nos marcadores bioqu\u00edmicos medidos \n\ntenha sido encontrada entre HHP e temperatura, os animais expostos a \n\n20 MPa e 4 \u00b0 C tamb\u00e9m morreram durante a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Os n\u00edveis de \n\nLPO e a atividade da GST aumentaram a temperaturas baixas, e por isso \n\na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie a essas temperaturas requer uma \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o mais aprofundada. Devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de resposta de todos  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nos biomarcadores medidos, esta esp\u00e9cie parece ser adequado para \n\nensaios laboratoriais com press\u00f5es de 10 MPa. A press\u00f5es de 20 MPa, \n\nforam observadas algumas altera\u00e7\u00e3o nos n\u00edveis de LPO e AChE ap\u00f3s 8 \n\nhoras de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o sendo por isso necess\u00e1rio \n\naprofundar o estudo destes efeitos. Al\u00e9m disso, a mortalidade registada \n\na temperaturas baixas faz com que o uso desta esp\u00e9cie em tais press\u00f5es \n\nseja limitada. Na segunda parte deste trabalho, a fim de avaliar o efeito \n\nda press\u00e3o sobre a sensibilidade desta esp\u00e9cie para a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\nc\u00e1dmio, P. varians foi exposto a v\u00e1rias concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00e1dmio \n\ndurante 96 h, juntamente com diferentes regimes de press\u00e3o: press\u00e3o \n\natmosf\u00e9rica; simultaneamente, durante 8 horas, com uma press\u00e3o de \n\n20 MPa; e pr\u00e9-expostos a 20 MPa durante 8 h. Os valores de LC50 \n\ncalculados foram semelhantes para os diferentes regimes de press\u00e3o, o \n\nque indica que a esta press\u00e3o n\u00e3o s\u00e3o observados efeitos sobre a \n\ntoxicidade do c\u00e1dmio para P. varians. Embora esta seja uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nimportante dos efeitos t\u00f3xicos do c\u00e1dmio a press\u00f5es elevadas, s\u00e3o \n\nnecess\u00e1rios estudos adicionais sobre outras esp\u00e9cies e outros produtos \n\nqu\u00edmicos que tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o propensos a aparecer no fundo do mar. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nBiomarkers; abiotic conditions, deep-ocean, temperature, marine mining. \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe recent rising threats to the deep-sea, as deep-sea mining, require a \n\nbetter understanding about the unique characteristics of these \n\necosystems. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is one of the most \n\nimportant abiotic conditions to life in this environment; however its \n\neffects on processes and structures of the organisms are very poorly \n\nunderstood. While experimentation with organisms from the deep-sea \n\nis very challenging and expensive, assessing the effects of HHP using \n\nshallow-water species seem to be best approach. The caridean shrimp \n\nPalaemon varians is a species with close phylogenetic relation with \n\nsome key species in the deep-sea. In the present study, P. varians was \n\nexposed to a range of different HHP (10, 20, 30 and 40 MPa) and to two \n\ndifferent temperatures (4 \u00baC and 20 \u00baC), and biochemical markers \n\n(AChE, GST, CAT activities and LPO level) were measured in order to \n\nevaluate the use of this species as a model for future laboratory \n\nresearch. All animals died during exposure at HHP above 20 MPa. While \n\nno interaction between HHP and temperature on biochemical markers \n\nwere found, animals at 20 MPa and 4 \u00baC also died during the exposure. \n\nLPO levels and GST activity increased at low temperatures, and the use \n\nof this species at such temperatures requires further investigation. Due \n\nto the absence of response of all biomarkers measured, this species \n\nseems to be suitable for laboratory assays with pressures of 10 MPa. At \n\n20 MPa, some small alteration in LPO and AChE levels after 8 hours post \n\nexposure may require further investigation. Also, the mortality  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nregistered at low temperatures makes the use of this species at such \n\npressures limited. In order to evaluate the effect of pressure on the \n\nsensitivity of this species to cadmium, P. varians were exposed to \n\nseveral concentration of cadmium during 96h, along with different \n\npressure regimes: at atmospheric pressure; simultaneously, for 8h, with \n\na pressure of 20 MPa; and pre-exposed to 20 MPa for 8 h. Only slightly \n\ndifferences were found between the calculated LC50 for the different \n\npressure regimes, indicating that at this pressure no effects on the \n\ntoxicity of cadmium to P. varians are observed. Although this is an \n\nimportant input regarding hazard assessment at higher pressures, \n\nadditional studies are needed regarding other species and other \n\nchemicals that are also prone to appear in the deep sea. \n\n \n\n\n\nINDEX \n\n \n\nPart 1  General Introduction .......................................................................................................... -

With an average depth of 3800 m \n\nand a volume of 1368 x 106 Km3, is by far the largest ecosystem on earth (Ramirez-Llodra \n\net al. 2011). The beginning of the deep-sea is marked by a clear transition between the \n\nshallow-water fauna of the continental shelf to the deep-water fauna at about 200 m \n\ndepth (Sanders et al. 1965). Because of this 200 m water layer, all existing and needed \n\ninformation for a comprehensive understanding of structure and functions of the deep-\n\nsea depends on modern and expensive technology, being often a very slow process. Due \n\nto these difficulties, in 1844, Edward Forbes, after a period of extensive sampling in the \n\nMediterranean in which no sign of life was observed, proposed the Azoic Theory, stating \n\nthat little or no life could be found bellow 600 m (Anderson and Rice 2006). However, \n\nduring the late 19th century, the necessity of laying telegraphic cables in the ocean \n\nbottom pushed by the industrial revolution led to a series of important expeditions, \n\nespecially the worldwide cruise HMS Challenger (1872-1876) that found deep-sea \n\norganisms in all the samples recovered from different abyssal plains (Glover et al. 2010; \n\nRamirez-Llodra et al. 2011; Thistle 2003). After this expedition, a growing interest for the \n\ndeep-sea led to a period of intense exploration, culminating in the Galathea expedition \n\nwhich proved that animals could be found at all depths (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). After \n\nthis period of intense exploration the deep sea was viewed as a quiescent environment, a \n\nvast undisturbed and invariant dark sedimented plain with low biodiversity and no \n\nseasonality (Tyler 1988). Nowadays, this idea has been strongly rejected. Newly \n\ndeveloped technology, such as cameras and remote operated vehicles, allow having a \n\nbroader vision of the deep-sea environment. It is now known that benthic storms are an \n\nexample of a dynamic process that can re-suspend sediment in hours or the sink of a \n\n\n\n- 2 - \n \n\nwhale carcass can provide food for a variety of specialized organisms, changing the \n\ncommunity composition of a given site for years (Gage and Tyler 1992). Extensive \n\nsampling using corers, trawls and sledges has shown a much higher biodiversity that \n\noriginality thought and recent studies put the biodiversity of several taxonomic groups \n\npresent in the deep-sea above several hotspots of diversity, such as the coral reefs and \n\nrain forests (McClain and Schlacher 2015). The extreme conditions of the deep-sea seem \n\nto be a counterpoint to such high biodiversity, and the reasons behind it are not fully \n\nunderstood (L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2001; McClain and Schlacher 2015). \n\nTo explain the adaptation of deep-sea organisms, the importance of this ecosystem \n\nin the global environment and the threats and ways to protect it, further investigation is \n\nneeded in order to understand the condition that rule life in the deep-waters.  \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Characterization and abiotic conditions  \n\n \n\nThe deep-sea has very unique set of conditions that makes life-traits very different \n\nfrom any other ecosystem.  \n\nTemperature is relatively stable in deep-water systems when compared to other \n\nenvironments. In shallow-water, temperature changes with seasonality and latitude, \n\nvarying between almost 0 \u00baC in high latitudes to ?27 \u00baC in low latitudes (Thistle 2003). \n\nHowever, temperature drops with increased depth, reaching to -1 to 4 \u00baC in abyssal \n\nplains, while variation due to latitude and seasonality can be considered almost negligible \n\n(Gage and Tyler 1992; Mantyla and Reid 1983). Hydrothermal vents are the exception; in \n\nthose the temperatures can reach up to 400 \u00baC, heating the water and constituting \n\n\u201cwarm oasis\u201d in the frigid waters of the deep-sea (Lutz and Kennish 1993).  \n\nPressure is probably the most predictable condition in marine ecosystems. It has a \n\nlinear relationship with depth and increases about 1 MPa for every 100 m of water. In the \n\ndeepest parts of ocean, like in the Mariana Trench, it can reach almost 110 MPa. These \n\npressures can crush any terrestrial and shallow-water organism, although many animals \n\nand bacteria have adapted to live in such conditions (Somero 1992). \n\n\n\n- 3 - \n \n\nSlow descent surface water keeps the salinity of the deep-sea at 35, very close to \n\nthose observed in marine shallow-water (Thistle 2003). Few exceptions occur, for \n\nexample in the Mediterranean Sea, where the deep-water have a considerably higher \n\nsalinity of about 38 (Tsimplis and Baker 2000).  \n\nNo photosynthetic useful light reaches depths below 250 m, even in clear water. \n\nTherefore photosynthetic processes do not occur in the deep-ocean. Chemosynthetic \n\nprocesses are considered the basis of food chains in some isolated communities, like \n\nhydrothermal-vents and cold seeps, but in most of the abyssal plains, food is imported \n\nfrom shallow-water and land communities (Thistle 2003). The occasional sinking of a large \n\ncarcass (e.g., whales) constitute an enormous input of food that can last for decades, \n\nwhile the continuous sinking of small particles as crustacean molts and faecal pellets are \n\nalso very important in terms of nutrient re-cycling (Gage 2003). Despite this absence of \n\nphotosynthesis, the deep-sea water is kept oxygen saturated by the descent of surface \n\nwaters which form currents across the ocean floor (Thistle 2003).    \n\nMost of the deep-sea is covered by small particulate sediment, mostly originated by \n\nthe weathering of rocks on land and by particles produced by planktonic organisms such \n\nas the silica shells from diatoms (Thiel 2003). In some places, bare rock is also present, \n\nwhich constitutes an important fixation point for several organisms (Glover et al. 2010). \n\nThe abiotic conditions in the deep ocean are so different from other habitats that it \n\nis often considered an extreme environment. But the definition for \u201cextreme \n\nenvironments\u201d is related to the distance from the \u201coptimum conditions\u201d. Therefore it \n\nusually reflects a terrestrial or shallow water organism \u201cpoint of view\u201d. For both deep-sea \n\nand shallow water species, the homeostatic effort required to maintain internal \n\nconditions when exposed to environmental conditions beyond optimum is increased and \n\nposes a challenge to their survival (Brown and Thatje 2014; Treude et al. 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.1.2  Biological effects of pressure \n\n \n\nAny physiological or biochemical process that involve a change in the system\u2019s \n\nvolume is affected by changes in pressure (Somero 1992). The effect of high hydrostatic \n\n\n\n- 4 - \n \n\npressure (HHP) in a system can be analyzed by the follow equation (Gross and Jaenicke \n\n1994; Macdonald 1997): \n\n(\n? ln ?\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n\n=  \n???\n\n??\n \n\nWhere k is the reaction rate coefficient, p the pressure, T the absolute \n\ntemperature, R the gas constant and ?V is the difference between final and initial volume \n\nof the reactants. At constant temperature, the reaction rate coefficient (k), which \n\ndetermines the direction in which a chemical reaction shifts, is affected by the pressure \n\nand by changes in volume. Hence, the dependence of k on pressure can be written: \n\n(\n? ln ?\n\n??\n)\n\n?\n\n=  \n??? ?\n\n??\n \n\nWhere ?V? represents the activation volume of a reaction. Thus any reaction with a \n\ndecrease (negative) change in volume will be accelerated and any reaction with an \n\nincrease (positive) in volume will be slowed down. In table 1 are listed the volume change \n\nassociated with some important biochemical reaction that are affected by pressure. For \n\nexample, the formation of ionic interaction in the water molecule occurs associated with \n\nan increase in the volume. Hence an increase in pressure favors the dissociation of the \n\nionic interaction and an increase of the free [H]+. This leads to a decrease in the pH of \n\npure water by 0.3 when pressure is increased from 0.1 MPa to 100 MPa (Gross and \n\nJaenicke 1994).  \n\nSeveral proteins and biomolecules are affected by pressure. In the table 1 we can \n\nsee that the denaturation of myoglobin is induced by an increase in the pressure. This \n\ndissociation by pressure occurs in most of the multisubunit proteins, with sensitivity to \n\npressure being as higher as the rate of the volume change associated to its dissociation \n\n(Cioni and Strambini 1996; Somero 1992). Even when partial, this denaturation exposes \n\nnonpolar groups of the protein to water causing its inactivation (Balny et al. 2002). \n\nDiverse processes in the organism can be affected by this sensitivity of proteins to HHP, \n\namong others, enzymes catalysis, protein mediated signalization and transport of \n\nbiomolecules (Chong et al. 1985; Ruan and Weber 1989; Siebenaller et al. 1991). The cell \n\n\n\n- 5 - \n \n\nmorphology can be also changed due to the dissociation of tubulin and actin caused by \n\nHHP (Brown and Thatje 2014; Swezey and Somero 1985).  \n\n \n\nTable 1 Reaction volume associated with some biochemical important reactions at 25 \u00baC (adapted from Gross and \nJaenicke 1994) \n\nReaction Example ?V (ml/mol) \n\nProtonation H+ + OH- ?

This reduction in the membrane functionality is explained by the reduction in the \n\nfluidity of the phospholipid bilayer (S\u00e9bert et al. 1997). Changes in the fluidity highly \n\naffect the transmission potential in neural cells of organisms of shallow waters (Oliphant \n\net al. 2011; Wann and Macdonald 1980). These malfunctions cause the high pressure \n\nneurological syndrome in terrestrial and shallow water organism\u2019s when exposed from \n\nslightly too severe changes in pressure. Virtually, all neural and muscular functions on the \n\norganism are affected by this change in pressure causing tremors, lack of movement \n\ncoordination and other neurological malfunctions (Oliphant et al. 2011).  \n\nTransmembranar ion flux across the membrane is drastically affected by changes in \n\npressure (Macdonald 1997). For example, Roer and Shelton 1981 reported a reduction of \n\nsodium uptake by crayfish of 80% when exposed to a pressure of 50 to 100 atm. Several \n\n\n\n- 6 - \n \n\nproteins on the membrane that play key roles on the osmoregulation are also highly \n\nsensitive to pressure changes. One of the most important proteins in the osmoregulation \n\nprocess, the Na+ K+ - adenosine thriphosphatase (Na+ - K+ ATPase), was shown to be very \n\nsensitive to the change in the fluidity of the surrounding cell membrane being highly \n\ninhibited by HHP (Chong et al. 1985). \n\nWith all these effects on the function of proteins and membranes, it is not \n\nsurprising that complex processes, such as the transcription and transduction of DNA into \n\nmRNA and proteins, involving several proteins and different cell compartments, are \n\nshown to be highly affected (e.g. Hardon and Albright 1974; Hildbrand and Pollard 1972). \n\nFor example, Hildebrand and Pollard (1972) showed that an increase in pressure of about \n\n640 atm caused 95% inhibition of the synthesis of polyphenylalanine. \n\nHowever, it is important to point out that volume change can occur not only in \n\nmolecules directly involved in the processes itself, but also by the pressure ability to \n\nchange the density and viscosity of the involving aqueous environment. Therefore, some \n\nprocesses are disrupted not by a shift in the protein responsible for it, but by changes in \n\nfluidity of the surrounding membrane (Chong et al. 1985; Somero 1992). Hence it is \n\nimportant to look at the whole system and not only a process or a chemical reaction \n\nalone. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.3  High pressure and low temperature, a biological bottleneck \n\n \n\nDespite the mechanism of action being different, studies have shown that both high \n\npressures and low temperature have similar effect on biological systems (Pradillon and \n\nGaill 2007; Ravaux et al. 2013).  While pressure effects result only from volume changes, \n\ntemperature affects both volume and energy in the system (Pradillon and Gaill 2007).  \n\nFor the cellular membrane, both low temperature and high pressure cause an \n\nincrease in the phospholipid bilayer order and also a decrease in fluidity (Macdonald and \n\nCossins 1984). A temperature increase of 2.8 \u00baC has been reported to reverse the effect \n\non the fluidity of the membrane caused by an increase in pressure of 10 MPa (Brown and \n\n\n\n- 7 - \n \n\nThatje 2014; De Smedt 1979 et al.). The reduction in membrane functionality and fluidity \n\nand of the proteins associated caused by both high pressure and low temperature \n\ndifficult the transport of ions and biomolecules from and within the cell, leading to a \n\nhigher demand of energy to keep the internal homeostasis (Brown and Thatje 2015; \n\nSomero 1992). Survival under such conditions is time limited, because the higher demand \n\nof oxygen to keep the increased mitochondrial activity is not always matched by an \n\nincrease on the ventilation and circulation capacity on the organism (Brown and Thatje \n\n2014; Cottin et al. 2012). Despite adaption being needed in other compartments and \n\norgans, the capacity of an organism to keep the aerobic function, appear to be the key for \n\nsurvival at low temperatures (Sommer and P\u00f6rtner 2002).  \n\nLike the exposure to high pressures, low temperature also causes denaturation on \n\nthe structure of diverse proteins, putting more pressure on the mitochondria\u2019s capacity to \n\ndeliver energy for the production of chaperones to counteract this process (Brown and \n\nThatje 2015; Privalov 1990). This denaturation is related with the unfolding on the \n\nstructure caused by the hydration of nonpolar groups by water (Privalov 1990). This \n\nunfolding open the normally compact structure of the protein, exposing other nonpolar \n\ngroups to water and causing its inactivation (Balny et al. 2002; Privalov 1990). This \n\nrelation between the water content of the body tissues and the resistance to exposures \n\nto pressure and temperature outside of the normal ranges can be observed in \n\ntardigrades. Tardigrades are small terrestrial microorganisms that when exposed to \n\nextremely dry environments become immobile and shrink, losing almost all the water in \n\ntheir body and stopping most of the biological processes (Seki and Toyoshima 1998). This \n\nstate allows them, among other things, surviving to extremely low temperatures and high \n\npressures. While on his normal state they only support pressures until 200 MPa and \n\ntemperatures of about -196 \u00baC, at the dehydrated state they can survive pressures above \n\n600 MPa and temperatures as low as -253 \u00baC for long periods of time (Hengherr et al. \n\n2009; Seki and Toyoshima 1998).     \n\nGiven the fact that both high-pressure and low temperature promote similar effects \n\nin the organisms structures and metabolism, it is not surprising to observe a similar \n\nresponse in organism exposed to low temperatures or HHP. Several cold shock response \n\n\n\n- 8 - \n \n\nproteins usually found in response to cold temperatures can also be found in organisms \n\nexposed to high pressures (Wemekamp-Kamphuis et al. 2002). Wemekamp-Kamphuis et \n\nal. (2002) reported that the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes increases his resistance to \n\nhigh pressure from 200 MPa to 300 MPa when prior incubated at 10 \u00baC and then \n\ntransferred to 37 \u00baC, when compared to those always kept at 37 \u00baC. Avrova (1984) \n\nreported an increased presence of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and low saturated fatty \n\nacids (a well-known adaptation to cold temperatures) on the deep-living fish Antimora \n\nrostrata when compared to his shallow-water cousins adapted only to cold temperatures.  \n\nThe synergistically effect of cold temperatures and high pressures indicate that \n\nthese abiotic conditions can be the major barrier that shallow water living organism had \n\nto overcome in the colonization of the deep-sea (Brown and Thatje 2015; Cottin et al. \n\n2012; Mestre et al. 2014). The colonization of deep-sea may therefore occurred during \n\nthe Mesozoic and early Cenozoic periods, when the ocean was colder and the difference \n\nin temperatures between upper and bottom of the water column were smaller (Cottin et \n\nal. 2012). Evolution of deep-sea life at high altitudes, where the differences in the \n\ntemperature of the upper layers of water and the water below is also a possibility (Thatje \n\net al. 2005). \n\nSome taxonomical groups appear to be originated from the deep-sea. For example, \n\nLindner et al. (2008) found that stylasterid corals, the second most diverse group of \n\nextant hard corals, appeared in shallow water environment through three distinct \n\ninvasions from the deep-sea. Despite this and other examples, the invasions of deep-sea \n\nanimals to shallow-water environment appear to be relatively few (Brown and Thatje \n\n2014). This can be explained by the low ability of deep-sea organisms to compete with \n\nshallow-water species by resources. De Long and Yayanos (1986) reported a lower \n\ncapacity of transport of glucose in deep-sea bacteria when exposed to shallow-water \n\npressures. Several adaptation allow the deep-sea organisms to survive under-pressure, \n\nhowever those same adaptation cripple their ability to compete in shallow-water \n\nenvironments. Deep-living species not only are adapted to the high pressure, but they \n\nalso perform better under it and sometimes even require these conditions to survive and \n\nperform basic life functions like reproduction and growing (Harper et al. 1987; Yayanos \n\n\n\n- 9 - \n \n\n1986). Therefore organisms that colonized the deep-sea had adapted to low \n\ntemperatures, HHP and total absence of light (Somero 1992).   \n\n \n\n1.1.4  Mining activity and other treats \n\n \n\nThe vastness and remoteness of the deep-sea have always kept it away from public \n\nconsciousness. Due to its size and the covering water layer, it is perceived as safe from \n\nanthropogenic pressures that endanger almost all the other habitats. When dumping \n\nwaste on land is considered unethically, unaesthetically or inconvenient, it is common \n\nsinking it on the sea. This \u201caway from sight, away from mind\u201d idea led to the presence of \n\ndiverse materials in the bottom of the sea. Despite several conventions that legislate and \n\nprohibit the dumping of litter from ships, being the International Convention for the \n\nPrevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) the most important (www.imo.org), United \n\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that about 6.4 million tons are still \n\nbeing dumped in the sea every year from vessels only (UNEP, 2009; Strand et al. 2015). \n\nDespite the vastness of the deep-sea, this dump of materials can have a huge impact on \n\nthe ecosystem. For example, in the age of steam power, transatlantic ships used to dump \n\nclinker to the sea. In many spots of the deep-sea, usually associated with old common \n\nroutes, this residuum of burnt coal can form more than 50% of the hard substratum with \n\nunknown consequences (Kidd and Hugget 1980).  \n\nLike the visible waste, several contaminants such as synthetic organochlorine \n\ncompounds (Iwata et al. 1993), chlorofluorocarbons (Doney and Bullister 1992), \n\npharmaceuticals, sewage and radioactive materials (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011) also reach \n\nthe deep-sea. The downwelling of dense water masses is the main entry of these \n\ncontaminants (Thiel 2003), which can also sink alone adsorbed to small particles (Mason \n\nand Fitzgerald 1992; Thiel 2003). \n\nAnother source of pressure that has not been taken into account for several years is \n\nthe effect of global changes in the deep-sea. The deep-sea is not immune to the fast \n\nglobal changes that are presently occurring, due to anthropogenic activity. Climate \n\nchange is predicted to imply acidification of the seawater, temperature changes, \n\n\n\n- 10 - \n \n\nexpansion of hypoxic zones, destabilization of the slopes and changes in the nutrient cycle \n\n(Glover et al. 2010; Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). Unlike other more studied ecosystems, \n\neffects in the deep-sea are very hard to predict and evaluate, thus very few data is \n\navailable, and changes in the community composition are very hard to evaluate (Glover et \n\nal. 2010). \n\nRecently, a new threat to the deep-sea ecosystem has been also described. The idea \n\nof exploring the mineral resources of the deep-sea is not recent, as the first dredge of \n\nminerals with commercial interest was performed in 1873 (Thiel 2003; Thiel et al. 2013). \n\nBetween the years of 1977-81, very intensive exploitation was performed, but the mining \n\nproject did not advance due the value loss of metals in the market (Thiel et al. 2013). \n\nSeveral impact studies were carried out, however the lack of technology and the market \n\nconditions were not favorable and several projects were delayed. In the recent years \n\nhowever, the rising price of the minerals in the global markets and the development of \n\nnew advanced technologies that permit cheaper and effective ways of exploration had \n\ncaused an exponentially increase in the interest for this resources (Thiel et al. 2013). \n\nThree forms of mineral resources are the mainly target for mining exploitation: \n\nmanganese nodules, cobalt rich crusts and massive polymetallic sulphide deposits \n\n(Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). The problem with these resources is that most of them are \n\nlocalized in hydrothermal vents and on other spots of high biodiversity and their removal \n\nis expected to cause a high impact on the communities (Dover 2014). The full extensions \n\nof impacts are far from being completely understood, and the recovery rates of \n\ncommunities can take several years (Mestre et al. 2014). Due the high value of the \n\nresources several projects have already started (Nautilus and Coffey 2008; Lamarche and \n\nClark 2012; ISA 2011). Mining cause several direct impacts on the previously undisturbed \n\ndeep-sea communities, like the loss of habitat by removing the hard subtract which is \n\nessential for organisms fixation (Coffey and Nautilus 2008). The minerals are mechanically \n\nremoved and then dragged to the surface and filtered to recover particles >8 \u00b5m, with \n\nthe remaining mud being then returned to the sea, and forming a plume that buries \n\nsessile organisms from areas of several Km2 (Coffey and Nautilus 2008; Dover 2014; \n\nMontagna et al. 2013). These processes can re-suspend a lot of metals in sea water, some \n\n\n\n- 11 - \n \n\nof them with a recognized higher toxicity, that are then transported for several kilometers \n\nby the bottom currents of the deep-sea (Mestre et al. 2005; ISA 2011; Thiel 2003). In the \n\nimpact studies conducted in the Red Sea, between 1977 and 1981, several trace metals, \n\nsuch as cadmium, nickel, mercury, lead, and cobalt were released to the water (Thiel \n\n2003). The first toxicological tests with mine tailings, demonstrated a threshold level of \n\napproximately 10 mg solids per liter. Considering the typical recommended safety factor \n\nof 0.1% to exclude chronic effects, content above 0.01 mg L-1 would be unacceptable \n\n(Thiel 2003). Concentrations above this levels are however likely to occur in the plume \n\nassociated with the removal of minerals (ISA 2011; Mestre et al. 2014). \n\nOriginated by either inland sources, such as industry and sewage, by vessels or from \n\nmining, man-made contaminants are today ubiquitous in the deep-ocean (Thiel 2003). \n\nSeveral studies have shown that different abiotic factors can change the toxicity of many \n\ncompounds (see Holmstrup et al. 2010, for review), therefore it is important to \n\nunderstand the role of the unique environmental conditions in the deep-sea on the \n\ntoxicity of the compounds. Providing this data can be essential to the elaboration of \n\ncomplete impact studies of the mining in the deep-sea and to the well informed take of \n\nconservation and management actions. In addition, finding good test species to assess \n\nhazard in the deep-sea environment can be challenging. Not only all the systems \n\napparatus for capturing, transport and maintenance of the organisms in laboratory are \n\nreally expensive, but also it is changeling to capture a sufficient number of animals to \n\nallow a representative amount of replicates required for a robust laboratory assay \n\n(Mestre et al. 2014; Ravaux et al. 2013; Treude et al. 2002). Finding suitable shallow-\n\nwater organisms that can be used as model for this type of assays is of crucial importance. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 12 - \n \n\n1.2  PALAEMON VARIANS \n\n \n\n1.2.1  Taxonomy and morphology \n\n \n\nThe crustacean Palaemon varians (Leach 1814), referred in old literature as \n\nPalaemonetes varians (Grave and Ashelby 2013), commonly called Atlantic Ditch shrimp, \n\nis a shrimp from the order Decapoda and infraorder Caridea.  \n\nLike other caridean shrimps, the body of P. varians is elongated with a very \n\nhydrodynamic form which allows fast locomotion while swimming. His body can be \n\ndivided in two major parts, the cephalothorax, constituted by the head, two stalked eyes, \n\nthorax, and the abdomen. The body is covered by an exoskeleton, a thin, transparent and \n\nvery flexible organ that confers support and protection. \n\nThe cephalothorax is protected by a calcified carapace and contains almost all the \n\nshrimp vital organs such as the brain, the stomach and the heart (fig. 1). The abdomen is \n\nalmost totally constituted by muscle, adapted for their swimming activity, and also holds \n\nthe ventral nerve cord and the hindgut (Bauer 2004). \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 1 Adult specimen of Palaemon varians. \n\nLike most decapods, P. varians has sexual dimorphism. The second pair of pleopods \n\nis modified in the males and used for mating. Females do not present this modification \n\nand usually have a bigger body compared to the males. During the reproductive season, \n\nthat takes place from late may until early september, females have a different molt called \n\nbreeding dress that is characterized by the presence of extra setae, with the purpose of \n\n\n\n- 13 - \n \n\negg bearing (Bouchon 1991; Frelon et al. 1993). This molt allows the fixation and \n\nincubation of embryos in the abdomen, for approximately 30 days, and posterior release.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2.2  Habitat, ecology and relevance \n\n \n\nP. varians can be generally found in inland coastal ponds, like estuaries and salt \n\nmarshes with abundant vegetation that provides shelter and food. Normally it is found in \n\nturbid and shallow waters, with salinities varying from very low (but never in freshwater) \n\nto salinities above the salinity of the seawater (>35). Besides salinity, several studies have \n\nfound that this species has a high capacity to adapt to different water temperatures, \n\noxygen concentrations, and even pressure (although it is never found on deep waters), \n\ncharacteristics that allow P. varians to have a wide range of distribution in Western \n\nEurope (Healey 1997; Oliphant et al. 2011; Palma et al. 2009). It can be found from the \n\ncoasts of Norway in the North Sea and in Baltic Sea, down to the coasts of southern \n\nEurope and north-western Africa until Tunisia in the Mediterranean basin (Aguzzi et al. \n\n2005; Cuesta et al. 2012; Gonzales-Ort\u00e9gon and Cuesta 2006; Healey 1997). \n\nP. varians is very important in the transference of nutrients across various tropic \n\nlevels. Escaravage and Castel (1990) reported an increase in abundance of nematodes, \n\ninsect larvae\u2019s and copepods when P. varians is present in the community. Due to its \n\ndetritivorous habits, it promotes the mechanical breakdown of organic matter, such as \n\nmacroalgae and plants, into small particles causing their resuspension (along with \n\nbacteria and other organisms) in the water column, making them available to the \n\nmicrofauna (Escaravage and Castel 1990). Despite its diet consisting mainly of small algae \n\nand plant parts, P. varians is also an active predator of microfauna, such as nematodes \n\nand mosquito larvae, across the entire water column (Aguzzi et al. 2005; Escaravage and \n\nCastel 1990).   \n\nBeing one of the few native species of shrimps from the Iberian Peninsula with \n\ncommercial value, P. varians is commonly captured in Portugal and Spain (Palma et al. \n\n2009; Pinto 2010). Due to its high economic value and seasonal fluctuation in terms of \n\n\n\n- 14 - \n \n\navailability, P. varians is produced in intensive/semi-intensive systems, like abandoned \n\nsalt ponds in southern Spain and Portugal (Aguzzi 2005; Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o 2013; Pinto 2010). \n\nAccording to the records of FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \n\nNations), P. varians is the only species of crustacea produced in Portugal. The production \n\nstarted in 2005 and in 2013 it was registered the highest production with a total of about \n\n5 tons produced. Despite being a small shrimp, P. varians is used in human consumption \n\nand as live bait in fishery (Palma et al. 2009). P. varians is also used as live feed in \n\naquaculture, with special importance to the production of commercial species with higher \n\ndemand on live feeds (Domingues et al. 2003; Domingues et al. 2009; Palma et al. 2008; \n\nSykes et al. 2006). Domingues et al. 2003 and Sykes et al. 2006 reported good growth \n\nrates of cuttlefish Sepia officinalis when fed with P. varians. Palma et al. 2008 reported \n\nthe same results for the seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus when feed with a mixture of P. \n\nvarians and mysids shrimps. \n\nAlthough not so extensively used as other species, P. varians can be considered a \n\ngood test-species to be used in ecotoxicological assays (e.g. Boisson et al. 2003) due to its \n\nrelatively short life cycle, ease to handle, maintain and reproduce in laboratory. Also, this \n\nspecies has a lower sensitivity to changes in abiotic conditions, such as salinity (from 0 to \n\nsalinities above the seawater level), temperature (between 0 \u00baC and 33 \u00baC, Oliphant et al. \n\n2011) and hypoxia (Nielsen and Hangerman 1998).    \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3  CADMIUM \n\n \n\n1.3.1  Sources and uses \n\n \n\nCadmium (Cd), as others trace metals, occurs naturally in the environment, in \n\ngeological ores and in background levels in the marine environment (OSPAR 2010). Its \n\ndistribution is ubiquitous trough the environment, being present in water, soil and air \n\n(Flick et al. 1971). In freshwater cadmium is normally present in its ionic form, Cd2+, very \n\ntoxic to organisms. In saltwater, however, it forms complexes with chloride, reducing its \n\n\n\n- 15 - \n \n\ntoxicity (Simpson 1981). When compared with other trace metals, cadmium and his \n\ncompounds are relatively more soluble in water and in organic solvents (Nordic Council of \n\nMinisters 2003). Despite the existence of cadmium ores (greenockite), their abundance is \n\nnot sufficient to justify mining and cadmium for industrial purposes is produced as a by-\n\nproduct from mining, smelting and refining of other minerals, primarily sulphide ores of \n\nzinc (ECB 2007).  \n\nCadmium is used in NiCd batteries, as intermediate and catalyst for electroplating, \n\nas a pigment in paint, as stabilizer for plastic, in photographical processes and in dyes \n\n(ECB 2007; OSPAR 2010). However, due to its toxicity new legislation has been adopted in \n\nthe last decades, restricting cadmium use and making its price drop; nowadays its \n\nproduction is more dependent on zinc refinement than on market demand (Nordic \n\nCouncil of Ministers 2003).  \n\nIn the European Union, cadmium use has been reduced in the last decades and \n\nbanned in several products as cosmetics, packing and toys. Its use is regulated by the \n\nAnnex XVII of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 of December 2006 on registration, evaluation, \n\nauthorization and restriction of chemicals (REACH), which has been applied in all member \n\nstates since the 1st June 2009.  \n\nThe most important sources of cadmium and its compounds to the environment are \n\nemissions from combustion processes in industry and power plants, and in fertilizers, \n\nwhere cadmium is present as an impurity in the phosphate minerals used during \n\nproduction (ECB 2007; OSPAR 2010). Despite the lower toxicity of cadmium in its metallic \n\nform, when in the environment it transforms into soluble ions Cd2+ which are much more \n\ntoxic/hazardous (ECB 2007; Sunda et al. 1978). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 16 - \n \n\n1.3.2  Biological effects \n\n \n\nCadmium was included in 2013 in the Priority List of Hazardous Substances and \n\nconsidered the seventh more hazardous substance for human health by the Agency for \n\nToxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry. For the aquatic ecosystem, Abel (1989) had listed \n\ncadmium as the second most toxic metal to aquatic life, only surpassed by mercury.  \n\nCadmium is harmful to cells primarily due to his affinity to sulfur, present in several \n\namino acids, binding to the proteins and preventing them to interpret their metabolic role \n\n(Rainbow 2002; Sarkar et al. 2013). Moreover, aquatic invertebrates, algae, fish and other \n\nspecies, as humans, bioaccumulate cadmium in their tissues and contrary to the majority \n\nof trace metals, evidences of possible cadmium biomagnification were reported in a \n\nmicrobiological food web and in freshwater food webs (Croteau et al 2005; Gray 2002; \n\nRainbow 2002; Werlin et al. 2010). All crustaceans, as P. varians, are not able to regulate \n\ncadmium concentration in their body, being accumulated in the cytosol in a detoxified \n\nform, primarily bound to methallothioneins, without potential excretion (Engel and \n\nFowler 1979; Rainbow 2007). This accumulation of cadmium in the cells can induce \n\nmultiple effects, like inhibition of several transport mechanisms in the cell membrane, \n\nchanging the cellular and plasma concentration of other metals, such as calcium and \n\nsodium, whose concentrations are essential for the normal function of the cell (Dhavale \n\net al. 1988; Verbost et al. 1989). As other toxic compounds, accumulation of cadmium is \n\nalso linked with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen \n\nperoxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) (McGeer et al. 2011). Despite the short half-\n\nlife, ROS can cause multiple damages in several structures of the cell, such as proteins, \n\nlipids and DNA (Gobe and Crane 2010). The cell has several enzymes which catalyze \n\nreaction to control the presence of ROS, such as catalase that converts H2O2 into water \n\nand oxygen (Patra et al. 2011). Cadmium binds to the complex III of the mitochondrial \n\nelectron transport chain, causing an increased formation of ROS, and disrupting the \n\nbalance between antioxidant enzymes and the amount of ROS (Chen et al. 2011; McGeer \n\net al. 2011; Wang et al. 2004). \n\n\n\n- 17 - \n \n\nSome marine diatoms, like Thalassiossira weissflogii, in the absence of zinc, can \n\nproduce a specific carbonic anhydrase that replaces zinc by cadmium in its active site. This \n\nenzyme catalyzes the conversion between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide, essential for \n\nthe algae metabolism (Lane &amp; Morel 2000; Lane et al. 2005). Due to the low \n\nconcentration of zinc in the ocean and the high density of microalgae in the aquatic \n\nenvironment when compared to plants, despite its toxicity, cadmium may play an \n\nessential role in the global cycle of carbon (Lane et al. 2005). However, no other biological \n\nfunction is known for cadmium and still being generally considered a non-essential metal \n\nfor organisms. \n\n \n\n1.4  BIOMARKERS \n\n \n\nBiomarkers are tools which allow the evaluation of an exposure to a toxic agent, the \n\nextent of the response and that can also be used to predict a likely response (Timbrell \n\n1998). Biomarkers can be divided in 3 types: i) biomarkers of exposure are the actual \n\nchemical, or molecules that results from his metabolization than can be measured in the \n\nbody, and/or in its excretions. This type of biomarkers is particularly useful in \n\nbiomonitoring assays (e.g. Eason and O\u2019Halloran 2003). ii) Biomarkers of effect are the \n\nquantifiable changes caused by a chemical compound or abiotic factor, and are important \n\nin lab-based bioassays because they can provide information about the mechanism of \n\ntoxicity of a certain compound (e.g. Oliveira et al. 2013). iii) Biomarkers of susceptibility \n\nare genetic factors that turn some organisms more sensitive than others to a certain \n\ncompound. \n\nSeveral enzymes are involved in the response to a toxic compound. The super \n\nfamily of soluble GSTs is a ubiquitous superfamily of multi-functional enzymes that occur \n\nmainly in the cytosol (Hayes et al. 2005); These group of enzymes neutralize a broad \n\nrange of toxic compounds and endogenous metabolic by-products in the detoxification \n\nprocess, conjugating electrophilic xenobiotics, such as chemical carcinogens and \n\nenvironmental pollutants, with glutathione (Hayes et al. 2005; LaCourse et al. 2009).  \n\n\n\n- 18 - \n \n\nThe exposure to several toxic compounds causes the production of reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS), which, although with short half-life, are highly reactive and have the \n\ncapacity to damage several structures of the cell (Winston and Di Giulio 1991). Lipid \n\nperoxidation (LPO) is one of the major effects of oxidative damage caused by ROS, and \n\nleads to loss of function of several cell structures, and its increase is a sign of a \n\ndisequilibrium in the mechanism of the cell to prevent ROS induced damage (Ruas et al. \n\n2008; Santi et al. 2011). Catalase is one of those enzymes involved in the protection of the \n\ncell against ROS by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2 into oxygen and water (Thannickeal \n\nand Fanburg 2000). The activity of catalase and other enzymes such as superoxide \n\ndismutase (which reduce O2- to H2O2) is very important in the prevention of damages \n\ncaused by ROS and play crucial roles in maintaining the cell homeostasis (Diaz-Albiter et \n\nal. 2011; Kopecka-Pilarczyk and Coimbra 2010). \n\nAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of \n\nacetylcholine in the cholinergic synapses in the central nervous system and in \n\nneuromuscular synapses, and its activity terminates the synaptic transmission (Santi et al. \n\n2011). It was extensively used as a biomarker indicator of exposure to organophosphorus \n\nand carbamate compounds (Colovic et al. 2013), although nowadays it is widely known \n\nthat this enzyme is inhibited by other chemicals such as metals (e.g. Frasco et al. 2005). \n\nThe inhibition of AChE causes accumulation of acetylcholine that leads to \n\nhyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, disrupting the neurotransmission \n\n(Colovic et al. 2013). \n\nExtensive work has been performed to address effects of toxic compounds using \n\nseveral biomarkers (e.g. Dewes et al. 2005; Ferreira et al. 2015; Oliveira et al. 2012). \n\nHowever, several biomarkers have been reported to be affected by environmental \n\nconditions such as temperature (Vinagre et al. 2014), HHP (Low and Somero 1975) and \n\nsalinity (Rodrigues et al. 2012), among others.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 19 - \n \n\n1.5  RATIONALE AND AIMS \n\n \n\nCollection, transport and stocking of deep-sea organisms is a challenging and \n\nexpensive task and toxicity testing using them as models imply a lot of technical \n\nconstraints. Therefore, it should be possible to employ shallow-water species as models \n\nto evaluate the potencial effects of HHP. Caridean shrimps from the species P. varians \n\nappear to be suitable candidates as they are phylogenetically related to important and \n\nemblematic deep-sea species (Mestre et al. 2014). Additionally, previous studies indicate \n\nP. varians as a species with a high capacity to adapt to different environmental \n\nconditions, such as pressure (Cottin et al. 2012; New et al. 2014; Oliphant et al. 2011). \n\nThis species is also very common and easy to capture and manage in the laboratory.  \n\nThis thesis is divided in two major parts. With the objective of determining how HHP \n\naffected P. varians and how suitable this species is to laboratory testing in pressure \n\nassays, several biomarkers were measured upon exposure to two different temperatures \n\nand five different pressure regimes. The biomarkers used were the activity of AChE, CAT \n\nand GST and LPO.  \n\nIn the second part of this work, the influence of HHP on the toxicity of Cd was \n\nstudied. Despite being far from human presence, contaminants released in the \n\nenvironment by anthropogenic activity can easily reach the deep sea. Also, deep-sea \n\nmining will lead to presence of metals, such as cadmium, in concentrations exceeding the \n\nsafety levels currently considered. For this purpose, P. varians was exposed to a range of \n\ncadmium concentrations, at different HHP regimes, and survival was recorded. The \n\nsuitability of this species for this kind of assays was discussed. \n\nIn the two parts of this work, a pressure system was assembled to simulate HHP \n\ncloser to those of the deep-sea. All procedures and details are included in this thesis in \n\nAnnex 1. \n\nThe main objectives of this work were: i) to evaluate the effect of HHP and low \n\ntemperature in P. varians; and ii) how HHP affects the sensitivity of P. varians to Cd. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 20 - \n \n\n1.6  REFERENCES \n\nAbel P.D., 1989.

High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is one of the \n\nmost important abiotic conditions to life in this environment; however its effects on \n\nprocesses and structures of the organisms are very poorly understood. While \n\nexperimentation with organisms from the deep-sea is very challenging and expensive, \n\nassessing the effects of HHP using species with strong phylogenetic relation with deep-\n\nsea organisms seem to be the best approach. The caridean shrimp Palaemon varians is a \n\nspecies with close phylogenetic relation with some key species in the deep-sea. In the \n\npresent study, P. varians was exposed to a range of different HHP (10, 20, 30 and 40 MPa) \n\nand to two different temperatures (4 \u00baC and 20 \u00baC), and biochemical biomarkers (AChE, \n\nGST, CAT activities and LPO level) were measured in order to evaluate the use of this \n\nspecies as a model for future laboratory research in HHP assays. All animals exposed at \n\nHHP above 20 MPa died during exposure. While no interaction in biochemical biomarkers \n\nwas found between HHP and temperature, animals exposed at 20 MPa and 4 \u00baC also died \n\nduring the exposure. LPO levels and GST activity increased at low temperatures, and the \n\nuse of this species at such temperatures requires further investigation. Due to the \n\nabsence of response of all the biomarkers measured, this species seems to be suitable for \n\nlaboratory assays with pressures of 10 MPa. At 20 MPa, some alterations in LPO level and \n\nAChE activity after 8 hours post exposure may require further investigation. Also, the \n\n\n\n- 32 - \n \n\nmortality registered at low temperatures makes the use of this species at such pressures \n\nlimited. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2  INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe deep sea covers more than half of the earth\u2019s surface. Starting in the edge of \n\nthe continental shelf (Sanders et al. 1965; Thistle 2003), the deep ocean is protected from \n\nthe surface conditions by a 200 m water layer. Because of this water layer, the deep-sea \n\npresents completely different conditions than those observed in shallow-water \n\necosystems, as very high pressures and lower temperatures. These extreme conditions \n\nhad posed a challenge for its exploration and therefore most of the processes that occur \n\nare unknown. However, recent advances in the modern industry and science allow an \n\nexploration of deep-sea resources, like minerals and fish, which was impossible a few \n\ndecades ago, disturbing these previous relatively stable ecosystems (Ramirez-Llodra et al. \n\n2011). In addition, the growth of the world population had led to a mass production of \n\nseveral materials which often found their final destination in the deep sea. While visible \n\nwaste tends to settle in the ocean floor, chemical compounds like metals and pesticides \n\nare transported during long-term periods by the same global currents that supply oxygen \n\nto the deep-sea ecosystems (Thiel 2003). A model study performed by Stemmler and \n\nLammel (2013) suggested that this horizontal and vertical transport can eventually led to \n\na re-rise of these contaminants to shallow-water, in important fisheries sites, disturbing \n\nalongside shallow-water ecosystems. Moreover, several of these contaminants have the \n\nability to bioaccumulate, disrupting the trophic chains, and changing the deep-sea \n\necosystem, and all the services provided (Thiel 2003; Thurber et al. 2014). Therefore, \n\ndeveloping techniques for monitoring the state of the deep-sea ecosystems are of crucial \n\nimportance in the near future, being the first step the detailed knowledge and \n\ncharacterization of its good status. \n\nSeveral biomarkers have been used as indicators of cellular stress due to \n\nenvironmental contamination in several environmental compartments. Several \n\n\n\n- 33 - \n \n\nenvironmental conditions, as temperature (Vinagre et al. 2014) or salinity (Rodrigues et \n\nal. 2012), have also been reported to affect the levels of several biomarkers; therefore \n\nthe influence of those factors must be taken into account in pollution monitoring \n\nprograms, to avoid biased results. One of the abiotic factors that should be considered \n\nwhen evaluating chemicals effects in the deep sea is HHP, whose effects are still poorly \n\nunderstood. Kopecka-Pilarczyk and Coimbra (2010a) found no (to few) effects of HHP on \n\nseveral biomarkers tested in the silver eel Anguilla Anguilla, a species in which part of its \n\nlife cycle occurs in the deep-sea. Hochachka (1974) reported adaptation of \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) extracted from the brain of deep-sea fish, which appear to \n\nhave a smaller binding region in the anionic site, as high pressure favors no-hydrophobic \n\nbindings; therefore effects of HHP in AChE can be expected in shallow-water organisms. \n\nBoth HHP and low temperatures have been reported to have several similar effects in \n\norganisms (eg. Oliphant et al. 2011), however no studies evaluating the effects of both \n\nconditions in biochemical biomarkers have been performed. \n\nDue to the constraints regarding the evaluation of hazardous effects in deep-sea \n\necosystems, one proposed way is the use of species that can tolerate or can adapt to high \n\npressures (Mestre al. 2014). The brackish shrimp P. varians has a close phylogenetic \n\nrelation with some deep-sea shrimps such as Rimicaris exoculata, Chorocaris chacei and \n\nMirocaris fortunata (Gonzalez-Rey et al. 2008; Mestre et al. 2014; Olhiphant et al. 2011). \n\nDespite P. varians being only found in shallow-water ecosystems, it has the capacity to \n\nsupport a wide range of temperatures (between 0 \u00baC and 33 \u00baC) and HHP (up to 30 MPa) \n\n(Oliphant et al. 2011). \n\nThe objective of this work was to evaluate if P. varians can tolerate HHP and low \n\ntemperatures and therefore be used as a test-species for hazardous assessment \n\nsimulating the deep-sea particular conditions. For that the effects of HHP and/or low \n\ntemperature were measured in biochemical biomarkers. The following rationale was \n\nfollowed: low to no changes in metabolism caused by pressure can indicate P. varians to \n\nbe a good model for deep sea ecotoxicological testing. The biomarkers tested were \n\ncatalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and \n\nacetycholinesterase (AChE).   \n\n\n\n- 34 - \n \n\n2.3  MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n2.3.1  Organisms\u2019 collection and acclimation conditions \n \n\nAdult grass shrimps (P. varians) were collected from a salt marsh (N 40\u00ba38\u201939\u201d; W \n\n8\u00ba39\u201951\u201d) at the Ria de Aveiro estuary in Aveiro, Portugal in January 2015. Shrimps were \n\ncollected with a net and afterwards transported to the laboratory at the University of \n\nAveiro, in 20 L buckets containing water from the collection point (\u00b112 \u00baC and salinity 17). \n\nAnimals with a carapace length between 4.7 and 5.2 mm were selected and acclimatized \n\nduring 48 hours to the laboratory conditions. After this period, animals were transferred \n\nin a density inferior of 3 shrimps per liter, to 20 L tanks containing clean synthetic sea \n\nwater at a salinity of 35 prepared with Tropic Marin\u00ae Sea Salt and freshwater purified by a \n\nreverse osmosis unit. Tanks were then kept at 20 \u00baC in a temperature controlled room \n\nand 16 h: 8 h light : dark cycle for a minimum of 10 days prior to testing. Once a day, 20% \n\nwater was renewed in each tank. Ammonia levels and pH were monitored using API\u00ae \n\ncolorimetric tests once a day. Constant aeration was provided by bubble stones and \n\noxygen monitored using a probe Oxi 330i/set WTW\u00ae. Food was provided twice a day \n\nconsisting of decapsulated Artemia cysts (Artemia salina) and seaweed food pellets \n\n\u00aeHikari Marine A. After one hour the reminiscent food was removed from the system. \n\n \n\n2.3.2  Pressure system \n \n\nThe hydrostatic pressure system used in this work is described in annex 2.   \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3  Pressure exposure \n \n\nAnimals were not fed 24 h prior and during the tests. For the pressure exposure, \n\ntwo animals were placed in 140 mL plastic vessels filled with synthetic saltwater at a \n\nsalinity of 35. All vessels were filled up till the top and closed with a lid. Four \n\nreplicates/vessels were placed in per hyperbaric chamber. Each chamber was then filled \n\nwith water at 20 \u00baC, closed and set to a desired pressure: 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 MPa. Two \n\n\n\n- 35 - \n \n\nchambers were used per pressure, being one left at 20 \u00baC and the other at 4 \u00baC. The \n\nexperimental control was additionally set to simulate optimal conditions, using the same \n\nexposure medium, two animals were place in four vessels with 250 mL synthetic salt \n\nwater, at 20 \u00baC with aeration and light.  \n\nAfter eight hours, all chambers were depressurized for 5 minutes, and one shrimp \n\nfrom each replicate treatment was transferred to a 2 mL cryotube and deep frozen in \n\nliquid nitrogen. The remaining individuals from each replicate were then transferred to \n\nthe control conditions (250 mL of aerated clean medium with aeration and light, at 20 \u00baC). \n\nFor shrimps exposed in the chambers at 4 \u00baC, the water in the control conditions was pre-\n\ncooled to the same temperature prior to the transfer of the shrimp to avoid a thermal \n\nshock, and then left in the room at 20 \u00baC. Organisms were left to recover another eight \n\nhours in optimum conditions, and were then deep frozen as above. Exposure conditions \n\nas pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen were also measured at the beginning and at the \n\nend of each exposure. All animals were stored at -80 \u00baC until biochemical analyses. \n\n \n\n2.3.4  Chemicals  \n \n\nAcetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5\u2019-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), bovine ?-globulin, \n\nreduced L-Gluthathione (GSH), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), trichloroacetic acid \n\n(TCA), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), \n\ndiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained \n\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich Europe (Netherlands). All the other chemicals used were purchased \n\nfrom Merck (Germany). \n\n \n\n2.3.5  Biomarkers analysis \n \n\nA) Sample preparation: \n\nPrior to homogenization, shrimps\u2019 exoskeletons and locomotors appendices were \n\nremoved with the help of a tweezers and a scalpel under a stereo microscope.  \n\nThe eyes plus stalks were then separated from the rest of the body and \n\nhomogenized in 0.5 mL of ice-cold k-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, 0.1 M) and then \n\n\n\n- 36 - \n \n\ncentrifuged at 3824 g during 3 minutes at 4 \u00baC. The resulting supernatant was used to \n\nmeasure AChE. Regarding the previous results by Veldesema-Currie (1973) eyes and stalks \n\nwere used to measure AChE activity as these organs alone represent a high percentage of \n\nthe total acetylcholinesterase activity (14\u00b13.3%).  \n\nThe remaining tissues were rapidly weighted and homogenized in k-phosphate \n\nbuffer (pH 7.4, 0.1 M). A 150 \u00b5L aliquot of the homogenate was separated and 2.5 \u00b5L of a \n\nsolution of BHT at 4% was added to prevent the formation of lipid oxidation artifacts \n\n(Torres et al. 2002) and the aliquot stored at -80 \u00baC up to a maximum of 24 h before lipid \n\nperoxidation assessment. The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 10 000 g during \n\n20 minutes at 4 \u00baC to obtain post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS). An aliquot of the \n\nPMS was then diluted in k-phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0) for CAT determination and a \n\nsecond aliquot diluted in k-phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5) for GST determination. Both \n\naliquots were stored up to a maximum of 1 week at -80 \u00baC prior to analysis. \n\nAll measurements were conducted using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum \n\nmicroplate reader. \n\n \n\nB) Lipid peroxidation determination \n\nLPO was determined by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances \n\n(namely malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation) as described by Ohkawa (1979) \n\nand Bird and Draper (1984). Briefly, to each sample aliquot prepared 500 \u00b5L of 12% TCA, \n\n400 \u00b5L of Tris-HCL (60 mM) with DTPA (0.1 mM) and 500 \u00b5L of 0.73% TBA were added to \n\nthe homogenate. The samples were then incubated during 60 minutes at 100 \u00baC and \n\ncentrifuged at 14000 g during 5 minutes, at 25 \u00baC. From the supernatant, 300 \u00b5L of \n\nsample was then transferred to the microplate and read at 535 nm. LPO was calculated \n\nusing an extinction coefficient of 1.53 x 105 M-1 cm-1 for the formation of TBARS and \n\nexpressed in nmol TBARS g-1 of tissue. \n\n \n\nC) Protein determination \n\nProtein quantification of all samples was performed according to Bradford (1976) \n\nmethodology as adapted to microplate by Guilhermino et al. (1996). In summary, 10 \u00b5L of \n\n\n\n- 37 - \n \n\nthe sample was incubated with 250 \u00b5L of Bradford reagent for 15 minutes. Absorbance \n\nwas then read at 595 nm. Bovine ?-globulin was used as protein standard. \n\n  \n\nD) Acetylcholinesterase activity determination \n\nAChE activity was determined by Elman\u2019s technique (Elman et al. 1961) adapted to \n\nmicroplate by Guilhermino et al. (1996). The sample was diluted 10 times, and the protein \n\nin the samples used was 0,251\u00b10.067 mg/ml. Briefly, for four replicates of 50 \u00b5l sample \n\nadded, 250 \u00b5l of reaction mixture (30 ml of k- phosphate buffer 0.1 M, pH 7.2, 0.2 ml of \n\nacetylthiocholine iodide 0.075 M and 1 ml of DTNB 10 mM) was added and the \n\nabsorbance at 414 nm was measured at 10, 15 and 20 minutes. After reading absorbance, \n\nthe AChE activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient for DTNB of 13.6 M-1 cm-1. \n\nFor normalization, the result was divided by the total amount of total protein and the \n\nenzymatic activity of AChE was expressed in nmol of substrate hydrolyzed per minute per \n\nmg of protein. \n\n \n\nE) Catalase activity  \n\nCAT activity was measured as described by Clairborne (1985) adapted to microplate. \n\nBriefly, for each PMS aliquot previously prepared (total protein of 0.787\u00b10.332), 15 \u00b5L of \n\nsample was added in quadruplicate in a microplate and 135 \u00b5L of K-phosphate buffer (pH \n\n7.0, 0.05 M) and 150 \u00b5L of H2O2 were added. H2O2 consumption was then measured at \n\n240 nm during 1 minute. After reading the absorbance, CAT activity was calculated using \n\na molar extinction coefficient for the conversion of H2O2 of 50 M-1 cm-1. For normalization \n\npurpose, the result was divided by the total amount of protein and catalase activity was \n\nexpressed in \u00b5mol min-1 mg-1 of protein. \n\n \n\n \n\nF) GST activity \n\nGST activity was determined by measuring the conjugation of reduced glutathione \n\nwith CDNB at 340 nm as described by Habit et al. (1974) adapted to microplate. In brief, \n\n200 \u00b5L of this reaction solution (14.85 mL of K-phosphate buffer 0.1M, pH= 6.5, 0.45 mL \n\n\n\n- 38 - \n \n\nof CDNB 10 mM and 2.7 mL of GSH) was added to 100 \u00b5L of PMS previously prepared \n\n(with a total protein of 0.630\u00b10.183 mg/mL of PMS) and measured at 340 nm during 5 \n\nminutes. After reading the absorbance, GST activity was calculated using a molar \n\nextinction coefficient for CDNB of 9.5 mM-1 cm-1. For normalization purpose, the result \n\nwas divided by the total amount of protein and the GST activity was expressed in nmol \n\nmin-1 mg-1 of protein.     \n\n \n\n2.3.6  Statistical analysis \n \n\nA Shapiro-Wilk test was performed in order to evaluate the normality distribution of \n\ndata. Appropriate data transformations were performed when necessary to perform \n\nfurther analysis. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare \n\npressure (atmospheric and 10 MPa) and temperature (4 \u00baC and 20 \u00baC) (?=0.05). A one \n\nway-ANOVA was performed to evaluate organisms exposed to different pressures \n\n(atmospheric, 10 MPa and 20 MPa) at 20 \u00baC. Post hoc, multiple comparisons of factors \n\nwere carried out using Holm-Sid\u00e1k method. Different t-tests were performed in all the \n\ndifferent treatments between value after the 8 hours exposure and after 8 hours \n\nrecovery. All statistics were performed using SigmaPlot version 11.0. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4  RESULTS \n\n \n\nAll animals exposed to 30 and 40 MPa of HHP died during the exposure. In addition, \n\nat 4 \u00baC the animals exposed to 20 MPa of HHP also died. All the other animals used during \n\nthe test survived both the exposure and after 8 hours of recovery. When removed from \n\nthe chambers, animals exposed to 20 MPa showed high activity when compared to all \n\nother treatments, but with some erratic movements. After five minutes in the recovery \n\nvessel, animals start presenting an apparently normal behavior, resting in the bottom of \n\nthe vessel without loss of equilibrium.  \n\n\n\n- 39 - \n \n\nNo statistical difference were found (p>0.05) between animals at optimal conditions \n\n(20 \u00baC, aeration and light) and those inside chambers, with no pressure set, at 20 \u00baC (fig. \n\n2).  \n\nNo interaction between pressure and temperature was found in all molecular \n\nbiomarkers measured, both after exposure and after the 8 hours recovery (p>0.05).  \n\nLPO levels (fig. 3) after the 8 hours exposure at 20 \u00baC with atmospheric pressure \n\nand at 10 MPa (258.06\u00b1154.82 nmol TBARS g-1 wt-1 and 160.28\u00b165.09 nmol TBARS g-1 wt-\n\n1) were significantly lower than animals exposed to 4 \u00baC at the same pressures \n\n(437.91\u00b1157.55 nmol TBARS g-1 wt-1 and 333.02\u00b195.03 nmol TBARS g-1 wt-1 respectively) \n\n(Two way ANOVA, F20,23= 8.694; p&lt;0.01). However, after 8 hours recovery, no differences \n\ndue temperature or pressure were observed (Two way ANOVA, F20,23 = 0.303; p>0.05). For \n\nanimals exposed at 20 MPa, no differences in LPO levels were observed after the 8 hours \n\nexposure. However, after 8 hours recovery, LPO level of organisms exposed at 20 MPa \n\n(468.24\u00b163.8 nmol TBARS g-1 wt-1) were significantly higher (One Way ANOVA \n\nF13,15=4.547; p<0.05) than those kept at atmospheric pressure (252.05\u00b1126.14 nmol \n\nTBARS g-1 wt-1). \n\nLower temperature also caused a significant higher activity of GST (fig. 4) (Two way \n\nANOVA, F24,27= 6.868; p<0.05), which does not occur after 8 recovery (Two way ANOVA, \n\nF20,23=0.047; p>0.05). In organisms exposed to 10 MPa at 20 \u00baC, GST activity were \n\nsignificantly higher after 8 hours recovery (12,32\u00b10.73 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein) when \n\ncompared to those measured in shrimps which were not allowed to recover (8.51\u00b11.68 \n\nnmol min-1 mg-1 protein) (t=-3.817; p<0.01). \n\nNo significant difference was observed in AChE levels (fig. 5) after the 8 hours \n\nexposure to pressure and temperature. However, after 8 hours recovery, animals \n\nprevious exposed to 20 MPa at 20 \u00baC had a significant (1 way ANOVA, F13,15 =5,141; \n\np<0.05) higher activity of AChE (91.57\u00b133.78 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein) when compared to \n\nshrimps exposed to atmospheric pressure (51.55\u00b117.56 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein) and 10 \n\nMPa (54.96\u00b17.94 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein).   \n\nNo significant differences were found in catalase activity (fig. 6) in all the conditions \n\nmeasured (p<0.05). In some animals, it was not possible to detect any enzymatic activity.  \n\n\n\n- 40 - \n \n\nOxygen and pH levels measured during the assay are presented in annex 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 2 AChE (A), GST (B), CAT (C) activities and LPO levels (D) measured at optimal conditions (20 \u00baC, aeration and \nlight) and in Palaemon varians that were inside the hyperbaric chamber (20 \u00baC, no aeration and no light) with standard \nerror bars.

Oliphant et al. (2011) and Cottin et al. (2012) observed a \n\nhigher disruption of P. varians behavior caused by HHP at lower temperatures and a \n\nhigher capacity to keep a normal function at HHP exposed to higher temperatures. \n\nCompared to these studies, P. varians showed less resistance to HHP in this work, thus all \n\nthe shrimps exposed to 30 MPa died during the experiment. This fact may have occurred \n\nbecause the system used in the present study does not allow a slower and controlled \n\nacclimation to HHP, similar to those used in other works. New et al. (2014) reported an \n\nincrease in HHP tolerance of P. varians when animals where acclimated to low \n\ntemperatures or HHP. \n\n  Contrary to the results observed in mortality at higher pressures and to several \n\nother processes and structures that are synergistically affected by HHP and low \n\ntemperature (Pradillion and Gail 2007; Somero et al. 1992), no interaction between 10 \n\nMPa pressure and low temperature were found in the measured biomarkers. HHP did not \n\nhave an effect on the levels of all the biomarkers measured till 20 MPa. This means that P. \n\nvarians can possible be a suitable candidate for ecotoxicological testing in order to \n\nevaluate the effects of pressure at 10 MPa. However, changes in proteins function and \n\nstructure are sometimes reversible after a short period after the end of exposure to HHP \n\n(Gross and Jaenicke 1993; Macdonald 1997). In the future, a possible way to test the \n\nfunction of the metabolism, and in particular, the effects of HHP in the function of the \n\nenzymes involved in the detoxification processes can be the evaluation of the damages \n\n\n\n- 44 - \n \n\ncaused by a toxicant while exposed to HHP in comparison to those caused in animals at \n\natmospheric pressure.  \n\nAs in the present work, Vinagre et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2001) also have \n\nreported increased in LPO levels in organisms exposed to low temperatures. Despite the \n\nfact that low temperature causes a reduction on the metabolism, and therefore a smaller \n\nproduction of ROS could be expected, the increased effort to maintain the homeostatic \n\ninternal conditions of the cell and the stress caused by the cold shock, can cause an \n\nincrease in the release of ROS which cause peroxidation of the lipids (Abele and Puntarulo \n\n2004; Wang et al. 2011).   Also, antioxidant enzymes like CAT and GST of animals from \n\nwarm waters have lower activity at low temperatures, and therefore a higher \n\naccumulation of ROS is possible (Abele 2002; Regoli et al. 1997). The significant increase \n\nin GST probably occurred due the increased level of hydroperoxides formed as secondary \n\nmetabolites during the peroxidation of the polyunasaturaded fatty acids (Hayes et al. \n\n2005). Vinagre et al. 2014 reported than different temperatures can change the levels of \n\nGST in shrimps. However Verlecar et al. (2007) did not found a clear increase in the GST \n\nactivity in organism exposed to a cold-shock. It is important to note that the temperature \n\nused in this work in the cold exposure is much lower than those used by Verlecar et al. \n\n(2007) and (Vinagre et al. 2014).  \n\nLevels of catalase obtained in the present study (1.05 \u00b1 0.78 \u00b5moles min-1 mg-1 \n\nprotein) were similar than those obtained in other studies, like the one of Gonzalez-Rey et \n\nal. (2007) where an activity of 2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5moles min-1 mg-1 protein in P. varians was \n\nreported. The absence of activity in some shrimps probably occurred due errors in the \n\nexperimental work. \n\nHochachka (1974) reported high disruption of AChE activity by pressure. The Km of \n\nAChE isolated from Electrophorus electricus increased about fourfold upon exposure to 20 \n\nMPa. In the present work already no effect of exposure to pressure and temperature was \n\nobserved in the AChE activity. While it is unlikely that the AChE of P. varians presents \n\nsimilar adaptation to the one found in deep-sea organisms by Hochachka, the absence of \n\nresponse in this work is a possible indicator that if in any time the activity of AChE \n\n\n\n- 45 - \n \n\ndecreases while under pressure, it has the ability of rapidly regains its function while at \n\nnormal temperature and pressure.  \n\nLike in the present work, Kopecka-Pilarczyk and Coimbra (2010a) did not find a \n\nsignificant effect of HHP in CAT and GST activity levels in silver eel (Anguilla anguillar). A \n\nsignificant reduction on LPO levels upon exposure to 5 MPa was observed. However, it is \n\nimportant to notice that contraty to P. varians, this specie is commonly found in some \n\nparts of its life cycle in the deep-sea. Also, these results were observed after 3 and 7 days \n\nof exposure, a longer-term period when compared to the one performed in this work. In \n\nPagellus bogaraveo no effect of HHP was found in GST, CAT, AChE activities and LPO \n\nlevels after 14 days exposure at 5 MPa (Kopecka-Pilarczyk and Coimbra 2010b). \n\nNo significant difference were found between animals placed inside the HC and \n\nthose exposed at optimal conditions, therefore this chambers can be used in this kind of \n\nassays. Although due the impossibility of renew the medium or provide oxygen, the \n\nduration of the test cannot exceed short periods of time with big invertebrates. \n\nBased on the absence or response of all the biomarkers measured in this work, P. \n\nvarians appear to be a suitable candidate to assess chemical hazard under pressures up to \n\n10 MPa, corresponding to depths of 1000 m. Although no effects were observed \n\nimmediately after the exposure, the shifts on the levels of LPO and AChE after an eight \n\nhour recovery should be investigated in order to use P. varians as a model for pressures \n\nbetween 10 MPa and 20 MPa. The changes in the LPO and GST levels due low \n\ntemperature can also restrain the use of P. varians as a model to evaluate stressors at \n\ndeep-sea conditions. Although, a significant part of deep-sea mineral resources is located \n\nnear hydrothermal vents, (Coffey and Nautilus 2008; Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011), with \n\nthese habitats displaying a high abundance and diversity of species (Thistle 2003). In this \n\nway, performing assays at higher temperature than those on the surrounding deep-sea \n\nmay be of special relevance to access potential impacts of deep-sea mining in these \n\nenvironments.  \n\n \n\n2.6  REFERENCES  \n\nAbele, D., 2002.

While the toxicity of these metals is very well described \n\nfor terrestrial and shallow-water organisms, few information is available regarding deep-\n\nsea organisms. Therefore, there is a need to develop or adapt ecotoxicological assays with \n\nmodel organisms, considering pressure and lower temperatures into account when \n\nassessing the effects of these metals to the deep-sea organisms. While the use of deep-\n\nsea species represents a challenge, shallow-water species, like Palaemon varians, can \n\nrepresent a good model organism due to their phylogenetic similarity. But understanding \n\nthe effects of high hydrostatic pressure is essential to infer their use for this purpose. In \n\nthe present work, P. varians were exposed to several concentration of cadmium during \n\n96h, along with different pressure regimes: at atmospheric pressure; simultaneously, for \n\n8h, with a pressure of 20 MPa; and pre-exposed to 20 MPa for 8 h. Only slightly \n\ndifferences were found between the calculated LC50 for the different pressure regimes, \n\nindicating that at this pressure no effects on the toxicity of cadmium to P. varians are \n\nobserved. Although this is an important input regarding hazard assessment at higher \n\npressures, additional studies are needed regarding other species and other chemicals that \n\nare also prone to appear in the deep sea. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 50 - \n \n\n3.2  INTRODUCTION \n\n \nCovering an area of 360 million Km2, equivalent to about 50% the surface of the \n\nEarth, the deep-sea is by far the largest ecosystem on earth. Protected by a water layer of \n\nabout 200m, the deep waters were perceived as highly buffered from the abiotic \n\nchanging conditions, or anthropogenic exploration and pollution which characterize \n\nterrestrial and shallow water environments (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). However this \n\nvision of a stable environment has changed since the late XX century. The deep-sea is now \n\nseen has a very rich biodiverse ecosystem with unique characteristic, with numerous \n\nmass extinction in the past and exposed to several changes and treats caused by human \n\nactivity (Glover et al. 2010; Grassle &amp; Maciolek 1992; Thuy et al. 2012).  \n\nThe major anthropogenic threats to the deep-sea ecosystem are chemical pollution, \n\nresources exploitation, like fisheries and minerals, and climate changes (Brown and Thatje \n\n2015; Montagna et al. 2013; Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011; Yasuhara et al. 2014). The \n\ndevelopment of new technologies enabled the exploration of diverse forms of \n\ninaccessible high commercial value mineral resources, such as gold, silver and zinc, which \n\nare now passive to be explored (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). The future mining activity is \n\nconsidered to be the major threat to several endemic ecosystems in the deep sea (Dover \n\n2014). The removal of the hard-substrate will cause not only a loss of habitat for the \n\nmarine fauna fixation, but also a considerable/potential exposure to high amounts of \n\nmetals, like mercury, cooper and cadmium, at concentrations exceeding the safety limits \n\n(Mestre et al. 2014; Thiel et al. 2015). The formation of sediment plumes can spread \n\nthese metals across time and space (ISA 2011; Nautilus and Coffey 2008), causing hazard \n\nto deep-sea organisms. Several studies have shown the high toxicity of these metals to \n\ndifferent marine fauna (e.g. Ahsanullarh et al. 1981). However no experimental work has \n\nbeen performed in order to test their effects in the deep-sea abiotic conditions. \n\nHydrostatic pressure is a continuous condition in the ocean, increasing about 1 MPa \n\nfor each 100 meters of depth in the water column. Pressure changes several processes in \n\nthe organisms, like membrane-based functions, conformation of proteins and the \n\nfunction and affinity for the enzymes\u2019 substrate (Brown and Thatje 2014; Somero 1992). \n\n\n\n- 51 - \n \n\nExposure of organisms to pressures out of the normal range can cause perturbation in the \n\nneural function, motor impairment, immobilization and ultimately death (Brown and \n\nThatje 2014; Macdonald 1997; Pradillon and Gaill 2007). However, the deleterious effects \n\nof metals and other compounds at high pressure conditions are almost completely \n\nunknown. The only work addressing this issue was performed by Edward and Ehrlich \n\n(1977) where several colonies of deep-sea bacteria were exposed to manganese, copper, \n\ncobalt and nickel. Their results indicated evidences of interaction between metal toxicity \n\nand the applied pressure. Depending on the tested metal, pressure had no effect or \n\nsynergistic or antagonistic effects when combined with a metal on the cell yield of the \n\ncolonies.  \n\nTesting the effect of pressure ranges in the toxicity of compounds in deep-sea \n\norganisms can be a hard and expensive task. The need of expensive equipment to keep \n\nthe animals at high pressure at all moments, during transport and maintenance (Pradillon \n\nand Gaill 2007), and the high number of animals required for an ecotoxicological assay \n\ncan be an obstacle. In addition, working with deep-sea organisms is challenging and \n\nperhaps impossible. Within this scope, and in the need of several impact studies to take \n\npressure into account when accessing the effects of these compounds in water, the use of \n\nshallow-water organisms with close phylogenetic relations with deep-sea species is can \n\nbe considered as a potential solution to overcome current constraints (Mestre et al. \n\n2014).  \n\nThe aim of this work was to test the effects of high hydrostatic pressure on the \n\ntoxicity of cadmium for the shallow-water shrimp Palaemon varians, Leach 1814. \n\nHowever, due to technical constrains, it was not possible to apply pressure for the full \n\nexposure to cadmium. The effect of cadmium was tested in animals exposed to two \n\ndifferent regimes of HHP during 8 hours (in animals exposed simultaneously to cadmium \n\nand pressure and in animals exposed to pressure prior to metal exposure). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 52 - \n \n\n3.3  MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n3.3.1  Organisms\u2019 collection and acclimation conditions \n \n\nAdult grass shrimp, P. varians, were collected using traps with bait from a salt marsh (N \n\n40\u00ba38\u201939\u201d; W 8\u00ba39\u201951\u201d) near the Ria de Aveiro estuary in Aveiro, Portugal in March 2015. \n\nCollected shrimps were transported to Universidade de Aveiro in 20 l buckets containing \n\nwater from the collection point. Animals with a carapace length between 3.5 and 4 mm \n\nwere then selected. After an acclimation of 48 hours, shrimps were placed, in a density \n\ninferior of three shrimps per liter, in 20 L tanks containing synthetic sea water prepared \n\nwith Tropic Marin\u00ae Sea Salt and freshwater purified by a reverse osmosis unit. Tanks were \n\nthen kept in a temperature controlled room at 20 \u00baC and 16 h: 8 h light : dark cycle for 20 \n\ndays prior to testing. Constant aeration was provided by bubble stones and oxygen was \n\nmeasured once a day with a probe Oxi 330i/set WTW\u00ae. Once a day, 20% water was \n\nrenewed in each tank and ammonia levels and pH were measured using API\u00ae colorimetric \n\ntests. Food was provided 2 times a day consisting in decapsulated artemia cysts (Artemia \n\nsalina) and seaweed food pellets \u00aeHikari Marine A. Excessive food was removed after 1 \n\nhour. \n\n \n\n3.3.2  Cadmium exposure \n \n\nThe protocol EPA OPPTS 850.1035 Ecological Effects Guidelines for Mysid Acute \n\nToxicity Test was used as a background and adapted for this work using P. varians. \n\nA stock solution of 1 g Cd/L was prepared by dissolving cadmium chloride \n\nanhydrous (CAS No. 10108-64-2, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in ultra-pure water (Millipore\u00ae \n\nAcademic Milli-Q system). To perform the dilutions necessary for the exposure tests, \n\nsynthetic sea water was used which was previously filtered with a 0.45 \u00b5m mesh. \n\nCadmium concentrations chosen for the test were 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/L. \n\nThese concentrations were based on preliminary studies (data not shown). \n\nIn the beginning and at the end of the tests, 50 mL of the medium sampled, from a \n\npool of the different replicates for each concentration was sampled, and filtered with a \n\n\n\n- 53 - \n \n\n0.45\u00b5m mesh. Samples where then acidified with nitric acid 60% and stored, prior to \n\nchemical analysis (according to EPA (1993)). Cadmium concentration in samples were \n\nanalyzed by ICP-OES spectrometer Horiba\u00ae Jobin Yvon, model Activa M with a \n\nautosampler JY AS500. The measurements were performed following the norm ISO \n\n11885, using a potency of 1200 W, with the following conditions: Power generator \n\n1200W, argon plasma flux of 13 L min-1, a Burgener Miramist nebulizer with an aspiration \n\nrate of 1 mL min-1 and a conical spray chamber. \n\n \n\n3.3.3  Acute toxicity test \n \n\n \n\nFor the acute toxicity test performed without changes in pressure, all organisms \n\nwere placed in pairs in 140 mL plastic vessels containing clean synthetic sea water. Each \n\nflask was filled until top and closed with a lid. All vessels were then placed in the \n\nhyperbaric chambers, without pressure being applied and stored in a room acclimatized \n\nat 20 \u00baC. Water used to fill the chambers was also at 20 \u00baC. After eight hours the animals \n\nwere removed, and randomly transferred for 250 mL plastic boxes containing the test \n\nmedium. Three replicates were set for each tested concentration plus a control with six \n\nreplicates (clean water). Three shrimps were randomly placed in each box and then \n\nclosed with a lid. Continuous aeration was provided by a bubble stone placed in each box. \n\nRoom temperature was kept at 20 \u00baC with photoperiod of 16 h : 8 h light : dark cycle. The \n\nnumber of survivors was counted every 24 h, and dead organisms removed; 20% of the \n\nmedium was renewed every 24 h during the test duration. No food was provided during \n\nthe test. \n\nDissolved oxygen using a probe Oxi 330i/set WTW\u00ae and pH were monitored using a \n\nprobe pH 330/SET WTW\u00ae and temperature was controlled with a thermometer at the \n\nbeginning and end of the test to pressure and as well as for the 96h exposure test. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 54 - \n \n\n \n\n3.3.4  Acute toxicity test with different exposures to pressure \n \n\nFor the acute toxicity test with pre-exposure to pressure, the same procedure \n\ndescribed above was performed. The only difference was that 20 MPa pressure was \n\napplied in the HC during eight hours. After this time, each HC was depressurized for five \n\nminutes and the vessels containing the shrimps in clean water removed. Shrimps were \n\nthen transferred for the plastic boxes containing the test medium. \n\nRegarding the simultaneous exposure to cadmium and pressure, shrimps were \n\nplaced in 140 mL plastic vessels containing the cadmium exposure medium, using the six \n\ndifferent cadmium concentrations mentioned above plus a control with clean medium. \n\nFive vessels for each concentration were filled up until top, and two shrimps placed per \n\nreplicate, and then closed with a lid. The vessels were then randomly placed in the HC \n\nand the chambers closed. Pressure was then set to 20 MPa and kept in a controlled room \n\nat 20 \u00baC for eight hours. After this period all HC were depressurized for 5 minutes and the \n\nshrimps randomly divided in groups of three and transferred to plastic boxes containing \n\n250 mL of new medium with the same concentrations which they were exposed in the \n\nHC. As above three replicates for each treatment were established plus a control with six \n\nreplicates. One individual for each concentration was discarded.  \n\nThe rest of the procedure was the same as described above for the shrimps pre-\n\nexposed and not exposed to pressure. \n\n \n\n3.3.5  Statistical analysis  \n \n\nMortality was used as endpoint and LC50 values calculated by Probit analysis using \n\nMinitab\u00ae Release 14.12.0.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n- 55 - \n \n\n3.4  RESULTS \n\n \nThe measured concentration of dissolved cadmium used in the tests is presented in \n\ntable 2. The LC50 values calculated were based on the real concentrations measured. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2 Nominal cadmium concentration and the respective dissolved concentrations obtained in the chemical analysis \n(mg/L). \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo mortality was observed in the control animals, for all the pressure tests, during \n\nthe full duration of the test. In addition, all animals were alive after the 8 hours of \n\nexposure to a pressure of 20 MPa in control and Cd treatments. However, animals \n\npresented some erratic movements after the decompression, as swimming backwards \n\nand sometimes in circles. After 5-10 minutes, no behavior differences were observed \n\nbetween animals exposed and not exposed to pressure and the animals appeared to be \n\nrecovered from decompression.  \n\nThe LC50 values were calculated for every 24 hs for P. varians exposed to cadmium \n\nunder different pressure conditions using the Probit analysis and are presented in table 3. \n\nAfter 48 h of exposure, animals pre-exposed to 20 MPa pressure showed a lower LC50 \n\nvalue (LC50= 9.46 mg/L) when compared with the other treatments. However, after 96 h, \n\nall LC50 values were similar. LC50 values for 24 h could not be calculated because no \n\ndose-response curve could be attained. \n\nNominal \nconcentration (mg/L) \n\nDissolved \nconcentration \n\nmeasured (mg/L) \n\n0.625 0.60 \n\n1.25 1.17 \n\n2.5 2.22 \n\n5 4.40 \n\n10 9.09 \n\n20 17.90 \n\n\n\n- 56 - \n \n\nFigures 7, 8 and 9 show the survival rates of P. varians at the different cadmium \n\nconcentrations for 48 h, 7 2h and 96 h, respectively, for the three different pressure \n\nassays. While sensitivity to the higher cadmium concentrations (9.09 and 17.9 mg/L) were \n\nalmost the same for the different pressure regimes, a higher mortality was observed in \n\nanimals not exposed to pressure at 1.17, 2.22 and 4.40 mg/L cadmium concentrations.

However, an \n\nexposure to HHP during the 96h was not possible to access, due the oxygen depletion in \n\nthe vessels. Finding ways to increase the exposure times should be tested in future \n\nassays. \n\nA synergism upon their combined exposure could be expected in this work, mainly \n\nfor 2 reasons. First, high hydrostatic pressure cause the dissociation of ionic bounds, \n\ntherefore more cadmium would be available in its ionic form, which is more toxic for \n\nmarine organisms (Engel and Fowler 1979; Gross and Jaenicker 1994). However, the \n\nextent of the increase in the ionic cadmium is unknown. Although no work was \n\nperformed with pressure, it is common that several natural stressors such as temperature \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 0,625 1,25 2,5 5 10 20\n\n9\n6\n\nh\n S\n\nu\nrv\n\niv\na\n\nl \n%\n\n[Cd] mg/L\n\nNo HHP exposure\n\nHHP + cadmium\n\nHHP before cadmium\n\n\n\n- 59 - \n \n\nand oxygen levels that are out of a species natural range can cause an increase in the \n\ntoxicity of a chemical (for review, see Holmstrup et al. 2010). However, the absence of \n\nresponse of P. varians to HHP in the previous work, can explain the equal response of P. \n\nvarians to cadmium when exposed to different pressure regimes. \n\nAs other organisms, P. varians have shown increase sensitivity to cadmium with \n\nthe increasing exposure time. While the seawater on open sea have a cadmium \n\nconcentration of 5-20 ng/L, concentration up to 400 ng/L have been reported in certain \n\ncoastal zones like in the Liverpool Bay, United Kingdom (Nordic Council of Ministers 2003; \n\nOSPAR 2002; UNEP 1985). Despite the lack of capacity of decapods to regulate internal \n\ncadmium levels (White and Rainbow 1982), the sensitivity of P. varians to an acute \n\nexposure is not relevant when the values are compared to the concentrations found in \n\nthe environment.  \n\nRegarding the sensitivity of the species used in the present work, it can be \n\nconsidered in the same range or lower in sensitivity when compared to other species. \n\nKhan et al. (1988) calculated a 96 h LC50 of total metal concentration for cadmium of \n\nPalaemon pugio of 1.83 mg/L and Burton and Fisher (1990) calculated a 96 h LC50 for the \n\nsame species of 1.3 mg/L. The 96 h LC50 for Palaemon vulgaris was calculated by Eisler \n\nwas 0.42 mg/L (in EPA 2001). When compared with the values calculated for other \n\nspecies of the same genus, P. varians have shown a lower sensitivity to cadmium (LC50 to \n\ntotal concentration of 2.81 mg/L). It is important to notice that a higher salinity was used \n\nin this work when compared to the other studies mentioned above which can also justify \n\nthese small differences. Both Howard and Hacker (1990) and Pierron et al. (2007) \n\nreported a positive relation between the increase on the toxicity of cadmium and the \n\nsalinity decrease in the shrimps Palaemon Pugio and Palaemon elegans respectively. At \n\nhigher salinities the amount of cadmium in the ionic form (Cd2+) is lower and therefore \n\nless bioavailable (Pierron et al. 2007; Sunda et al. 1978). \n\nWhile more research is needed to evaluate the effect of pressure on the sensitivity \n\nof different groups of organisms to metals, looking specially at sub-lethal and more \n\necological relevant parameters, this work provided evidences that exposure to high level \n\npressure do not cause an increase in the sensitivity of P. varians to cadmium.  \n\n\n\n- 60 - \n \n\n3.6  REFERENCES \n\nAhsanullah, M., Negilski, D.S., Mobley, M.C., 1981.

As land resources become exhausted due to overexploitation, \n\nthe interest on the deep-sea resources keeps growing. The rising of new technologies can \n\ntoday allow the exploitation of minerals which were unavailable a few decades ago. \n\nHowever, the management and protection of this previously undisturbed ecosystem \n\nrequire more knowledge to understand the effect of the very particular environmental \n\nconditions, the ecological services provided by the deep-sea and the ecology and \n\nvulnerability of the unique species which live there. \n\nThe main aim of the present study was to gain an insight knowledge on the \n\npollution effects in the deep sea, and for that available tools were tested. So a shallow \n\nwater marine species was used (Palaemon varians) based on its similarity in terms of \n\nphylogeny with deep-sea species, to understand the effects of HHP in their survival and \n\nselected biochemical biomarkers. These biomarkers are currently used tools in \n\nbiomonitoring studies as a way of detect effects upon exposure of an organism to \n\ncontaminants. In addition, a non-effective pressure was chosen in order to evaluate the \n\njoint effect with cadmium, as a model metal for environmental pollution. \n\nFor this work, an easy to operate and affordable high-pressure system was used. \n\nThe simplicity of the system when compared to others, allows running series of tests at \n\nlow costs. However, this system does not allow renewing the medium during the test \n\nduration. Because no aeration can be provided, the oxygen inside the test vessels quickly \n\ndrops due the animal\u2019s respiration, causing them to be in hypoxia some hours. Therefore, \n\nthe use of smaller species or younger animals, such as shrimp larvae can allow accessing \n\nthe effects of longer exposures to HHP using this system. However, no mortality or \n\nchanges in the biochemical biomarkers was observed in P. varians, showing that this \n\nshrimp can be used with this system while assessing effects of HHP during short term \n\nexposures.  \n\nAt hydrostatic pressure lower than 20 MPa, the tested biomarkers did not show \n\nany response to HHP indicating possibly low to no effect under those exposures. At low \n\n\n\n- 64 - \n \n\ntemperatures, the present work showed some changes of some biochemical biomarkers \n\nand interaction with HHP in terms of mortality. A long acclimation of the animals is a \n\npossible way to improve the use of these animals at low temperatures. \n\nExposure duration to pressure was also considered short termed and therefore \n\nlooking at long term exposures would also be advisable.   \n\nDespite some technical limitations, the present study gave an important \n\ncontribute for future research. While exposed to non-acute levels of HHP, P. varians have \n\nshown no sign of increased sensitivity to cadmium. Therefore, based on this work results, \n\nno potentiation of the toxic effect (mortality) from cadmium is expected when organisms \n\nare exposed to non-lethal levels of HHP for short periods of time. In the future, it is \n\nimportant to test longer exposures to metals under the effect of HHP. \n\nWhile more research is needed to test the effect of several other metals and \n\nxenobiotics, the data presented in this work can be of use in the elaboration of hazard \n\nassessment studies due to the exploitation of deep-sea minerals.  \n\n \n\nIn a nutshell: \n\n \n1. The pressure system used successfully simulated the desired parameters and \n\nthe conditions of the chambers did not have a significant effect in exposed \n\nanimals. \n\n \n\n2. P. varians did not survive pressures above 20 MPa, therefore cannot be used \n\nin assays which simulate conditions of depths higher than 2000 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Exposures to low temperatures cause some changes in P. varians biochemical \n\nbiomarkers and further investigation is required. \n\n \n\n4. Short-term exposure to HHP did not have any effect in the sensitivity of P. \n\nvarians to cadmium. \n\n\n\n-65- \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART 5  ANNEXES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n-66- \n \n\n \n\n\n\n-67- \n \n\nANNEX 1 \n\nTable 1 Oxygen and pH levels measured during the biomarkers assay using Palaemon varians.
