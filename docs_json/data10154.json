The capacity of species to shift distribution \nwill depend upon the constraints imposed by habitat quality and availability, and \nthe consequences for population growth and conservation will depend on the \nfitness benefits associated with the occupation of new sites. Model systems \nrequire well-quantified range changes and the capacity to track individuals in \nspace and time. \n \nThe purpose of Species Distribution Models, in particular predictive mapping, is \nto provide spatially explicit information on species occurrence and other \necological factors relevant for conservation planning. Spatial Conservation \nPlanning is a multidisciplinary approach that allows to identify important areas \nfor biodiversity and efficiently achieve conservation goals. \n\nOur main objectives in this study are (1) to understand the main environmental \ndeterminants affecting the distribution of the target species, (2) to evaluate \nhome ranges and feeding strategies, in relation to breeding colonies, of \ndifferent species or target groups, (3) to produce accurate seasonal probability \ndistribution models for each species or target groups (4) to establish \nprocedures based on statistic and spatial tools to identify ecologically relevant \nareas for species conservation. \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n i \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nChapter 1 1 \n\nGeneral Introduction 3 \n\nIntroduction 3 \n\nThesis objectives 7 \n\nThesis structure 7 \n\nReferences 8 \n\nChapter 2 13 \n\nTracing the steps of giants: modelling global distribution of sibling Giant Petrel species 15 \n\nAbstract 15 \n\nIntroduction 16 \n\nMethods 18 \n\nFieldwork 18 \n\nPositioning and filtering procedures 19 \n\nBackground information, data sources and geographical procedures 19 \n\nSpecies Distribution Modelling Procedures 21 \n\nNiche Overlap and Niche Breadth 26 \n\nResults 27 \n\nDiscussion 34 \n\nReferences 37 \n\nChapter 3 43 \n\nFrom locally extinct to a growing population: the range expansion of Audouin\u2019s Gull into \n\nPortugal and the use of new habitats outside its traditional breeding range 45 \n\nAbstract 45 \n\nIntroduction 46 \n\nMethods 49 \n\nGPS tracking 49 \n\nEnvironmental variables for Spatial Distribution Modelling 50 \n\nModelling procedures 52 \n\nNiche Overlap 53 \n\nCore Area definition 54 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n ii \n\nResults 55 \n\nModel evaluation and variables contribution 55 \n\nPredictive Distribution Maps 56 \n\nCore Area protection level 58 \n\nDiscussion 60 \n\nReferences 64 \n\nChapter 4 71 \n\nDesigning offshore EU Marine Protected Areas using Spatial Conservation Planning techniques: \n\na case study of the country with the largest European EEZ, Portugal 73 \n\nAbstract 73 \n\nIntroduction 74 \n\nMethods 77 \n\nData Collection 77 \n\nEnvironmental predictors 77 \n\nSpecies Distribution Modelling 80 \n\nSpatial prioritization 82 \n\nResults 85 \n\nDiscussion 88 \n\nAnalytical issues 88 \n\nImplications for marine conservation planning in Portuguese continental waters 89 \n\nReferences 91 \n\nChapter 5 97 \n\nGeneral Discussion 99 \n\nGeneral Discussion 99 \n\nMonitoring seabird spatial distributions 99 \n\nAdvantages of long-term monitoring schemes and multi-taxa approaches for Spatial \n\nConservation Planning (SCP) 101 \n\nSpatiotemporal flexibility of marine protected areas networks 102 \n\nReferences 103 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n iii \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\nFigure 1 - Jackknife test results for each seasonal species/sex group model: Northern Giant Petrel \n\nMales (SP1_SEX1), Northern Giant Petrel Females (SP1_SEX2), Southern Giant Petrel Males \n\n(SP2_SEX1) and Southern Giant Petrel Females (SP2_SEX2). 29 \n\n \nFigure 2 - Global predictive distribution maps based on the projection of each seasonal \n\nspecies/sex group model. 31 \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Variables\u2019 percent contribution to each monthly model.

This information is essential to develop appropriate \n\nconservation strategies for target species, particularly for those that occupy pelagic areas \n\nand undertake inter-continental movements, which are challenging to study regarding \n\ntheir life offshore as is the case of many seabirds. \n\n \n\nIn the marine environment, the processes that regulate the patterns of species \n\ndistributions are still an area of intensive research (Tremblay et al. 2009a, 2009b). However, \n\nit is known that the spatial distribution of seabirds is influenced by several biophysical \n\nfactors (Fauchald 2009; Wakefield et al. 2009) such as the topography and physiography of \n\nthe ocean floor, sea surface temperature, salinity, concentrations of chlorophyll, currents, \n\nprey productivity and also by human-induced factors, such as pollution, noise or fishing \n\nactivity (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds &amp; Shaffer 2009; Croxall et al. 2012). Understanding species \n\ndistribution and the effect environmental factors play in promoting or constraining the use \n\nof specific areas is paramount for undertaking evidence based management and \n\nbiodiversity conservation decisions (Sutherland et al. 2004; Pullin &amp; Knight 2009). For \n\ninstances, quantifying the spatial and temporal  overlap between foraging seabirds and \n\nfishing and fishing method, is essential to reduce both the competition for same resources \n\nand the direct mortality of pelagic birds due to some types of fishing gear (Belda &amp; S\u00e1nchez \n\n2001; Tuck et al. 2011; Croxall et al. 2012). \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \n\nClassical methods of acquiring information on animal occurrence in the marine \n\nenvironment, would mostly rely on hydrographic boat surveys, boat bird censuses or bird \n\nringing at breeding colonies, and dead recoveries on the coast which generated very limited \n\nspatial-temporal information and would be severely biased. This was primarily due to the \n\nfact that the spatial mathematical processing of data was very limited until quite recently. \n\nHowever, both technological and computational techniques have evolved significantly over \n\nthe past decade and at present, a number of suitable tools to collect detailed information \n\non animal movement are available as well as to analyse positional data in a refined and \n\ndetailed form (Croxall et al. 2005, 2012; Wilson et al. 2007; Aarts et al. 2008; Burger 2008; \n\nBograd et al. 2010; Soanes et al. 2016). At the same time monitoring the marine \n\nenvironment via satellite is particularly useful for studying the environmental variables of \n\nhabitats for species that exhibit great mobility, namely when it involves movements in \n\npelagic waters of different economic zones or when migration movements are inter-\n\ncontinental (Ristow et al. 2000). From spatial optical observations of sea surface it is now \n\npossible to amass information from remote areas at a relatively reasonable cost, for a wide \n\nrange of environmental characteristics, both physical (temperature of sea surface salinity, \n\nwind) and biological (ocean productivity, human disturbances, fishing effort distribution) \n\n(Rodhouse et al. 2001; Wilson et al. 2002). For example, biological productivity can be \n\nestimated from the phytoplankton abundance, which is estimated from the light absorbed \n\nby photosynthetic pigments, which in turn are calculated through optical biophysical data \n\ncollected by satellite sensors. This information allows characterizing the different types of \n\nmarine habitats and to investigate the interactions between them and bird distribution.  \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrent technological and industrial capacity of building various miniaturized instruments \n\nin order to be transported by medium sized seabirds, revolutionize the study of species \n\nwhich traditionally were impossible  to track, most noticeable in pelagic habitats (Hunt &amp; \n\nWilson 2012). Among these animal tracking equipment, it stands out for their interest, \n\nrelatively affordable prices and reduced dimensions the Light Level Geolocators (GLS) \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nloggers and the Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers.  The weights of GLS loggers range \n\nfrom 0.3g upwards, while GPS loggers range from 2-3g upwards (depending on the models, \n\nbattery capacity and spatial resolution). Current guidelines for instrumenting birds state \n\nthat external devices should not exceed 3\u20135% of the birds\u2019 body mass (Kenward 2001; \n\nVandenabeele et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe wide availability of remote sensing data, GPS devices and computing power led \n\nsimultaneous developments on computer and statistical sciences, which now provide the \n\nmethodological and theoretical frameworks for predictive ecology (Roberts et al. 2010). \n\nNowadays, Geographic Information System (GIS) software allows the analytic integration \n\nof animal movement data and marine environmental variables, contributing to a better \n\nunderstanding of the multidimensional nature of marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the \n\nsimplification of data sorting and preparation for species distribution modelling (e.g. \n\nspatially rarefying occurrence localities, preparation of climate data, and creation of \n\nbackground bias files) and the easy access to several statistical software packages, allowed \n\nthe development of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) analysis (Guisan &amp; Thuiller 2005) \n\nin predictive ecological studies (Brown 2014). In recent years, the mathematical algorithms \n\nand methodologies to analyse movement patterns and spatial modelling have evolved \n\nsignificantly (Aebischer et al. 1993; Guisan &amp; Zimmermann 2000; Jonsen et al. 2003; Aarts \n\net al. 2008; Wakefield et al. 2009) and multiple methods are currently available. A major \n\ndistinction among these is the kind of species occurrence data they require (Elith et al. \n\n2010). Analysis of species occurrence data collected systematically (presence-absence \n\ndata) usually use regression methods, like generalized linear or additive models, GLMs or \n\nGAMs, or ensembles of regression trees, random forests or boosted regression trees, BRT \n\n(Elith &amp; Graham 2009; Elith et al. 2010). However, most studies on species distributions are \n\nnot based on systematic surveys due to the limited spatial coverage or other \n\nmethodological or logistic constraints thus resulting in presence-only data. This is the case \n\nof most of studies involving seabird tracking. In general, most seabird species usually \n\npresent a highly mobile behaviour (daily and/or seasonally), presenting relatively large \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nhome ranges, which makes them particularly difficult to study at sea using standardized \n\nmethods that require a good spatial coverage. Studies involving standardized census \n\nmethodologies at sea usually are very expensive and involve complex logistics, therefore a \n\nsuitable alternative is to track individual seabirds using bio-logging devices but attaining \n\npresence-only data. The necessity to maximize the utility of this kind of species occurrence \n\ndata has led to the emergence of several SDM methods for modelling presence-only data. \n\nMaxEnt software package (Phillips et al. 2006) is particularly popular in species \n\ndistribution/environmental niche modelling, most likely due to: (1) is one of the most \n\npractical methods for modelling species distributions; (2) it typically outperforms other \n\nalgorithms based on predictive accuracy; (3) it requires only presence data plus \n\nenvironmental information for the entire study area. Phillips et al. (2006) and Elith et al. \n\n(2010) provide information about MaxEnt mathematical computations, while Merow et al. \n\n(2013) provides a detailed explanation of its mechanics. \n\n \n\n \n\nPost-modelling analyses of species distribution models have also been simplified over time \n\n(e.g. assessment of the distributional changes between time periods or differences in \n\nhabitat use between species, populations or sex) (Warren et al. 2010; Brown 2014). This \n\nsimplification of processes usually relies on the development of software packages to \n\nautomatize data processing, simplify outputs generation or facilitate decision making. One \n\ngood example of this kind of software is Zonation, a publically available decision support \n\nsystem for spatial conservation planning. It produces a hierarchical prioritization of the \n\nlandscape and identifies areas important for retaining habitat quality and connectivity for \n\nmultiple species, indirectly aiming at species\u2019 long-term persistence. Zonation produces a \n\ncomplementarity-based priority ranking (Moilanen 2005). By combining SDM with spatial \n\nprioritization analysis it is possible to take biodiversity conservation actions, for instances \n\nby defining Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Kelleher 1999; Lascelles et al. 2016; Soanes et \n\nal. 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nThesis objectives  \n\n \n\nThis study aims to assess how relevant eco-geographical variables influence the \n\ndistribution, at different spatio-temporal scales, of umbrella species for marine \n\nconservation. Using predictive distribution models, based on habitat suitability of the study \n\nareas, it aims to produce relevant tools to support decision-making and establish effective \n\nconservation and management plans. This is achieved by undertaking the following overall \n\nobjectives: \n\n \n\n1. Understand the distribution of target marine bird species in the study areas.  \n\n \n\n2. Evaluate home ranges and feeding strategies, in relation to breeding colonies, of \n\ndifferent species or target groups. \n\n \n\n3. Relate the occurrence of birds with relevant environmental and ecological variables (eg. \n\nbathymetry, slope, distance to shore, distance to colony, winds, productivity, sea surface \n\ntemperature, salinity). \n\n \n\n4. Identify, using modelling techniques, important areas for the conservation of species. \n\n \n\nThesis structure  \n\n \nThis thesis is organized in five chapters. The first chapter presents a general introduction \n\nabout the theme and aims of the thesis.

We tracked 14 male and 11 female Northern Giant \n\nPetrels (NGP) and 13 male and 15 female Southern Giant Petrels (SGP), at Bird Island, South \n\nGeorgia, using Geolocators. Seasonal species distribution models, for each species and sex \n\ngroup, were computed using MaxEnt. Giant Petrels\u2019 summer distribution seems to be \n\nstrongly constrained by the proximity to breeding colony. It stands out that SGP have wider \n\nhigh-probability of occurrence areas around colonies and a greater niche breadth than \n\nNGP. Summer ecological niches clearly reflect the fact that both species are central place \n\nforagers. The winter models present clear evidences of post-reproductive dispersal effects, \n\nreflecting a latitudinal segregation between species. The two species seem to compete and \n\nshare a common preference for the same environment. However, SGP seem to prefer \n\nintraspecific competition rather than to compete with NGP. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nThe development of effective conservation strategies for seabirds depends largely on the \n\nknowledge of species distributions and their relationship with the marine environment. \n\nEarly pelagic seabird tracking studies tended to describe habitat use qualitatively \n\n(Wakefield et al. 2009). But during recent years and as a response to the growing need for \n\na thorough understanding of species geographical distribution, new predictive modelling \n\ntechniques have been developed and improved, allowing to extrapolate potential \n\ndistribution of species as a proxy for actual observations (Souza Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2009; Franklin \n\n2010). These approaches interpolate spatially occurrence data and eco-geographical \n\nvariables (both biotic and abiotic factors) to create a model of species\u2019 environmental \n\nrequirements, over large spatial scales (Anderson et al. 2003). Such computational \n\nadvances led to the growth of an interdisciplinary approach, that uses Machine Learning \n\nmethods to model complex ecological processes and patterns (Olden et al. 2008). One of \n\nthese methods is MaxEnt, specifically designed to develop species distribution models \n\n(SDM) with \u201cpresence-only\u201d occurrence data (Dud\u00edk et al. 2007). However, SDM applied to \n\nmarine species requires the use of oceanic environmental predictors. But the ongoing \n\ntechnological revolution has allowed establishing a vast archive of remotely sensed data \n\nfor the oceans and thus timely global oceanographic data from satellites are becoming \n\nreadily available, for both pelagic and neritic environments. Many of these variables (e.g. \n\nsea water temperature), are mapped at a coarse spatial scale, which is unsurprising given \n\nthe vast expanse and dynamic nature of the oceans, but this variation also limits the ability \n\nto establish valid correlations between marine species movements and habitat variables. \n\n(Franklin 2010). Nevertheless, these datasets allow attaining the environmental predictors \n\nin order to apply SDM to marine species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nMarine species pose a particularly difficult challenge with regard to their use of space as \n\nthey perform vast movements during the different stages of their annual cycle. Remote-\n\ntracking studies during the last decade have greatly contributed to address this lack of \n\ninformation and have allowed new insights into the spatial component of trophic niches of \n\nseabirds (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2007; Burger and Shaffer 2008; Tremblay et al. 2009). \n\nRecords obtained through remote-tracking can be considered as presence-only data, \n\nbecause they allow attaining information on species presence but don\u2019t allow inferring \n\nabout absence, since this information is relative to a sample of the total population. \n\nTherefore, the number of tracked birds (sample size) will greatly influence the quality of \n\nthe global information for the species distribution. In this sense, Light Level Geolocators \n\n(GLS) present two major advantages for these type studies. Firstly, their low energy \n\nconsumption allows its use during long periods of time, which allows amassing movement \n\ndata for a complete annual cycle. Secondly, these devices have a relatively low cost which \n\nallows, deployment on a larger sample of individuals at a low cost. \n\n \n\nNorthern and Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes halli and Macronectes giganteus) are \n\namongst the most pelagic bird species. These two sibling species have a sympatric \n\ndistribution and coexist at a number of sub-Antarctic archipelagos (Hunter 1987, Patterson \n\net al. 2008). Previous studies focused on their spatial ecology, comparing foraging areas \n\nexploited by individuals of the same colony and investigating interspecific and intersexual \n\ncompetition (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2000a, b; Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2002; Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. \n\n2007). \n\n \n\nOur main aims in this study were (1) to understand the ecological segregation and the main \n\nenvironmental determinants of the distribution of male and female northern and southern \n\ngiant petrels, and (2) to produce accurate seasonal probability distribution models for each \n\nspecies and gender group, in order to obtain predictive occurrence maps at a global scale. \n\nThese results can be used as a tool to implement conservation management actions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n \n\nMethods \n\n \nFieldwork \n\n \n\nFieldwork was carried out on Bird Island, South Georgia (54q, 03\u00b4S, 38q 36\u2019W) in October to \n\nMarch 1999 to 2001. On this island, estimated breeding pairs of northern and southern \n\ngiant petrels in 1996 was 2062 and 521, respectively (D.R.Briggs and R.Humpidge in litt.) \n\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2000a). The study colony comprised a few breeding aggregations of \n\ngiant petrels from both species, sometimes breeding intermingled, totalling more than 150 \n\nnests for each species. In November 1999, we deployed 100 Geolocators (GLS) mounted \n\non a Darvic ring in equal proportions on male and female northern and southern giant \n\npetrels during the incubation period. GLS were deployed on a single member of each pair \n\nto minimize any potential impact of the GLS on the breeding performance. We recovered \n\n63, 7 and 1 GLS after 1, 2 and 3 years respectively, and downloaded complete data from 14 \n\nmale and 11 female northern giant petrels and 13 male and 15 female southern giant \n\npetrels. Eleven GLS could not be recovered because they had fallen off the Darvic ring; the \n\nremaining 18 birds were not seen in the area over the following two years. The GLS used in \n\nthis study were developed by the British Antarctic Survey and weighed 16 g. The GLS were \n\nequipped with an internal clock and measured the light levels every 60 s, recording the \n\nmaximum reading within each 10 min interval (full details in (Afanasyev 2004). From this \n\ninformation 2 positions per day (one corresponding to midday and the other to midnight) \n\ncan be inferred with an average accuracy of 186 km \u00b1 114 km (Phillips et al. 2004a). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nPositioning and filtering procedures  \n\n \n\nPositions were calculated using Multitrace-3/16 light (Jensen Software Systems, 1997) by \n\ninspecting the integrity of the light curve day by day and fitting dawn and dusk times. The \n\nelevation angle of the sun was set at -5.5. To filter unrealistic positions, we removed: (a) \n\nthose obtained from light curves showing interferences at dawn or dusk (mainly due to the \n\nbird sitting on the ground or to the proximity of artificial light); (b) those inferred from days \n\nor nights longer than 23 hours; (c) those with a speed index (Vi) above 60 km/h, as \n\ncalculated by the root of the square speed average of the segments formed with the two \n\npreceding and the two following positions (McConnell et al. 2004): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere Vi,j+i is the velocity between successive positions i and j+i; (d) those within the \n\nequinox periods ranging from 19 March to 9 April and from 3 to 29 September (we set the \n\nequinox periods after a graphical inspection of the behaviour of the speed index over the \n\nyear). By this procedure we discarded 24.9% of 44,349 positions (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. \n\n2007). The analyses of the relationships between positions and the environmental variables \n\nwere restricted to an one year period, from 1st of November 1999 to the 31st October 2000 \n\n(25,847 positions). \n\n \n\n \n\nBackground information, data sources and geographical procedures  \n\n \n\nThe main purpose of this work was to obtain predictive distribution maps at a wide \n\ngeographical scale, so all data were converted to a WGS84 projection. Since we tracked the \n\nmovements of giant petrels using GLS with a nominal accuracy of 186 km we analysed large-\n\nscale habitat selection. Thus, cell size was set to 2\u00b0 x 2\u00b0 and the study area was restricted \n\nto south of 25\u00b0 South and north of 65\u00b0 South, because: (1) this area reflects the potential \n\n  \n\nVi =\n1\n4\n\n(vi, j+i)\n2\n\nj=- 2, j\u00b9 0\n\nj=2\n\n\u00e5\n\n\n\n 20 \n\ndistribution range of both species; (2) the accuracy of the GLS further south is limited by \n\nthe length of the day and night near the solstice periods; (3) most of the area below 65 \u00ba \n\nsouth is completely covered by ice (except in some areas in summer) and; (4) this area \n\nincludes the minimum possible portions of land (which giant petrels could not visit apart \n\nfrom the coastal areas). To work on spatial data we used ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 and MiraMon \n\n(Pons 2000).  \n\n \n\nWe considered a set of 16 eco-geographical variables (EGV) of three types: temporal \n\nenvironmental variables, static variables and spatial variables (Table 2). Static variables \n\nincluded bathymetry and bathymetry slope (derived from bathymetry). The temporal \n\nenvironmental variables tested for inclusion in the model were: chlorophyll a \n\nconcentration, ice concentration, sea surface temperature, surface wind speed, surface \n\nwind direction and rain rate. Spatial variables included distance to giant petrel colonies, \n\ndistance to seals colonies and distance to penguin colonies. \n\n \n\nBathymetry was obtained from the National Geographical Data Center from U.S.A. \n\n(ETOPO2; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html). This also allowed us to \n\ncalculate bathymetry slope, using GIS tools.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, we obtained monthly data on the sea surface variables from November 1999 \n\nto November 2000 from the following sources: (1) Chlorophyll a concentration from the \n\nSeaWiFS project (http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataset/SEAWIFS/index.html); (2) Ice \n\nconcentration from the British Atmospheric Data Center (BADC; http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/); \n\n(3) Sea surface temperature from the British Atmospheric Data Center (BADC; \n\nhttp://badc.nerc.ac.uk); (4) Surface wind speed from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, \n\nwww.remss.com); (5) Surface wind direction from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, \n\nwww.remss.com); (6) Rain rate from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, www.remss.com). \n\nBased on these monthly data, we calculated seasonal averages for each of these dynamic \n\nvariables. We didn\u2019t consider in this operation missing value raster cells, to avoid bias on \n\naverage results. \n\nhttp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataset/SEAWIFS/index.html\nhttp://www.remss.com/\nhttp://www.remss.com/\nhttp://www.remss.com/\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n\nBeside this subset of environmental dynamic variables, we decided to also include a group \n\nof spatial features we considered to have an ecological significance. Both Giant Petrels \n\nspecies are known scavengers and they depend on seals and penguin carcasses during \n\nbreeding season. Therefore, it seemed important to include in the variable set EGV that \n\ncould somehow reflect this ecological dependency on carrion availability. This was achieved \n\nby creating background layers that reflect distance to large seal colonies and distance to \n\nlarge penguin colonies in the study area, based on known colonies location and numbers.  \n\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. 2007) extensively discussed offshore inter and intra specific spatial \n\nsegregation in giant petrels. Thus, another predictive variable we considered to eventually \n\nhave an ecological significance is distance to other giant petrel colonies.  \n\n \n\nWe also considered important to evaluate the importance of distance to the several fronts: \n\nPolar Front, Subantarctic Front, Subtropical Front, Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Front \n\nand southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Information on location of these \n\nfronts was obtained from Orsi et al. (1995). \n\n \n\nThese background layers were calculated using the same computational procedure in \n\nArcGIS 9.2 to calculate the least cumulative cost distance for each cell to the nearest source \n\nover a cost surface (excluding all portions of land from the cost surface raster). \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecies Distribution Modelling Procedures  \n\n \n\nClassical habitat modelling techniques (e.g. Generalised Linear Model \u2013 GLM or Generalised \n\nAdditive Model \u2013 GAM) are based on presence-absence data (Guisan and Zimmermann \n\n2000, Redfern et al. 2006). The data collected using GLS only provides information about \n\nindividuals\u2019 movement. Therefore, this kind of data doesn\u2019t allow one to make correct \n\ninferences about a species \u201ctrue\u201d absence. Thus we decide to use a presence-only method \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nto develop predictive distribution models for both sex groups of Northern and Southern \n\nGiant Petrel, during summer and winter sub-Antarctic seasons. \n\n \n\nWe have chosen software application MaxEnt 3.1.1, to compute these seasonal habitat \n\nsuitability models, for each species and sex group, and obtain global predictive distribution \n\nmaps based on probability of occurrence. Detailed description of MaxEnt and its \n\nmathematical computations are given in Phillips et al. (2006, 2004b). \n\n \n\nMaxEnt is a general-purpose method for making predictions from incomplete information \n\nbased on the maximum-entropy principle, which assumes that the best approximation to \n\na unknown probability distribution is to ensure that it satisfies any constraints that we are \n\naware of (Phillips et al. 2004b). Applied to presence only species distribution modelling, the \n\nidea is to estimate the distribution of a species as a probability distribution across a study \n\nregion, subject to the constraints that each expected predictor variable has to match its \n\nempirical average over the presence sites. Of all the probability distributions that meet \n\nthese constraints, MaxEnt choose the most unconstrained one, i.e. the one of maximum \n\nentropy (Phillips and Dud\u00edk 2008). Phillips et al. (2006) outlined several MaxEnt advantages: \n\n(1) It requires only presence data plus environmental information for the whole study area; \n\n(2) It can utilize both continuous and categorical data and can incorporate interactions \n\nbetween different variables; (3) MaxEnt algorithms have been developed in order to ensure \n\nthe optimal probability distribution; (4) The results are amenable for interpretation of the \n\nform of the environmental response functions. This method has generated great interest \n\nbecause in comparisons it has shown higher predictive accuracy than many other methods \n\nwhen applied to \u201cpresence-only\u201d species occurrence data (Elith et al. 2006, Franklin 2010).  \n\n \n\nSeveral studies compared MaxEnt to other presence-only methods with several placing \n\nMaxEnt on the top-performing methods in terms of prediction accuracy (Elith et al. 2006) \n\nor concluded that it performed somewhat better than other methods (Hernandez et al. \n\n2006, Phillips et al. 2006, Pearson and Raxworthy 2007, Phillips 2008, Elith and Graham \n\n2009). \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n \n\nWe considered 4 independent sample sets (Table 1), based on species and sex: Northern \n\nGiant Petrels Males (NGPM), Northern Giant Petrels Females (NGPF), Southern Giant \n\nPetrels Males (SGPM) and Southern Giant Petrels Females (SGPF). So as to evaluate inter \n\nand intra-specific differences in habitat selection and distribution, we considered two \n\ndifferent seasons for modelling procedures: Summer (November \u2013 March) and Winter \n\n(June-September). We deliberately excluded data relative to April, May and October \n\nbecause: (1) these are transition months between sub-Antarctic seasons; (2) to exclude \n\nfrom analysis less accurate positioning data collected around equinox periods. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Abbreviations for each model, accordingly with 3 group criteria: season, species and sex. \n\n \n  Season \n\n  Winter Summer \n\nN\no\n\nrt\nh\n\ner\nn\n\n \n\nG\nia\n\nn\nt \n\nP\net\n\nre\nl \n\nMale WNGPM SNGPM \n\nFemale WNGPF SNGPF \n\nSo\nu\n\nth\ner\n\nn\n \n\nG\nia\n\nn\nt \n\nP\net\n\nre\nl \n\nMale WSGPM SSGPM \n\nFemale WSGPF SSGPF \n\n \n\n \n\nThe objective was to build, for each species gender group, a seasonal model with adequate \n\nperformance using the best subset of environmental variables. In brief, this would lead to \n\nthe production of 8 predictive distribution maps, i.e. two seasonal maps for each \n\nspecies/sex group.  \n\n \n\nTo accomplish this objective, the first step was to identify the EGV that are more important \n\nin predicting occurrence/habitat suitability. The Jackknife test of variable importance was \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nused to evaluate the relative importance of each predictor variable initially considered. The \n\ntraining gain is calculated for each variable alone, as well as the drop in training gain when \n\nthe variable is omitted from the full model (Peterson et al. 2007). This way we computed \n\nan initial model using 16 eco-geographical variables and those with lowest decrease in \n\naverage training gain when omitted were discarded (Table 2 \u2013 List of eco-geographical variables \n\nconsidered as relevant to predict occurrence and habitat suitability.). The results of this initial full \n\nmodel also revealed problems related with interactions between variables. We thus \n\ndecided to reduce the number of variables, including only the most significant ones. To do \n\nso, we compared models including different sets of predictive variables and evaluated \n\nwhich had better performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve \n\nstatistic (AUC) was used to test each model\u2019s discriminative ability. We also analysed the \n\nOmission Rate and Fractional Predicted Area based on the 10 percentile value for presence \n\n(Table 3). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nTable 2 \u2013 List of eco-geographical variables considered as relevant to predict occurrence and habitat \n\nsuitability. \n\n \n\nID Variable Code Discarded \nWinter  \n\nmodels \n\nSummer \n\nmodels \n\n1 Chlorophyll chla - ? ? \n\n2 Ice ice - ? ? \n\n3 Wind Direction wdir - ? ? \n\n4 Wind Speed wspeed - ? ? \n\n5 Rain Rate rain - ? ? \n\n6 Sea Surface Temperature sst - ? ? \n\n7 Bathimetry (DEM) DEM - ? ? \n\n8 Slope slope - ? ? \n\n9 Distance to Seals\u2019 Colonies dist_seals - - ? \n\n10 Distance to Penguins\u2019 Colonies dist_cpeng - - ? \n\n11 Distance to Giant Petrel Colonies dist_colgps - ? ? \n\n12 Distance to Polar Front dist_pf - ? - \n\n13 Distance to Subantarctic Front dist_saf - ? - \n\n14 Distance to Subtropical Front dist_stf ? - - \n\n15 Distance to Southern Antarctic  \n\nCircumpolar Current Front \n\ndist_saccf \n? - - \n\n16  Distance to southern boundarie of  \n\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current  \n\ndist_sac \n? - - \n\n \n\nEach model was projected to global study area, using as projection layer the variable \n\ndistance to giant petrel colonies. \n\n \n\nFor each species/sex group, we randomly drew from each individual dataset an equal \n\nnumber of tracking locations. This way we equalized the weight of each individual in the \n\nsample, in order to guarantee that the models\u2019 results are representative of the study \n\npopulations (Fieberg et al. 2010, Frair et al. 2010, Hebblewhite and Haydon 2010). We set \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nMaxEnt to remove duplicate presence records from the same grid cell to minimize \n\nautocorrelation biases. Model evaluation was realized with a two-fold cross validation, \n\nrandomly selecting 70% of sample points as training data and 30% as test data. \n\n \n\n \n\nNiche Overlap and Niche Breadth  \n\n \n\nIn order to quantify the niche similarity between SDMs (amongst groups and between \n\nseasons), we used a niche overlap index. Warren et al. (2008) state there is no a priori \n\njustification for any particular measure of environmental-niche differentiation or similarity. \n\nWe use a niche overlap index that compares our mean predicted probability distributions \n\ndefined over geographic space, in which pX,i (or pY,i) denotes the probability assigned by \n\nthe ecological niche model for species X (or Y) to cell i (Warren et al. 2008). The overlap \n\nmetric employed comes from the ecological literature; Schoener\u2019s (1968) statistic for niche \n\noverlap (D), \n\n \n\n? (??,?, ??,?) = ? ?\n?\n?\n\n ? |??,? ? ??,?|? , \n\n \n\nranges from 0 (niche models have no overlap) to 1 (niche models identical). \n\n \n\nIn addition, for each group, we calculated an estimate of niche breadth by applying a \n\ntraditional measure of niche breadth (Levins 1968). Standardized breadth measurements \n\nrange from 0 (one grid cell has a suitability of one, all other cells are zero), to 1, where all \n\ngrid cells are equally suitable (Mandle et al. 2010, Nakazato et al. 2010). \n\n \n\nThese metrics do not require application of a threshold to produce predictions of presence \n\nand absence, but rather uses the continuous estimates of habitat suitability directly \n\nproduced by MaxEnt. Niche overlap and niche breadth test were conducted using ENM \n\nTools 1.3 (Warren et al. 2008, 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nThough having a high AUC score, visual inspection of model results led us to decide to \n\nexclude some of the 16 initial variables, to correct artefacts resulting from interactions \n\nbetween correlated variables. These correlations were causing evident misleading \n\npredictions in some specific geographical areas. This way, after analysing the global model \n\nJackknife results, AUC scores and considering the ecological meaning of each eco-\n\ngeographical variable, we decided it was more coherent to consider different groups of \n\neco-geographical variables accordingly to season. Both species are more dependent on \n\ncarrion availability during breeding season and have a more pelagic foraging behaviour \n\nduring non-breeding season. Summer and winter model variables are described in Table 2.  \n\nWe thought it would be important that final predictive maps could somehow reflect also \n\nthe weight of colony size. To do so, we projected the models considering two different sets \n\nof information: a. using locations of all Giant Petrel colonies; b. using information on \n\nlocations of large Giant Petrel colonies (more than 300 breeding pairs). We then overlapped \n\nthe results of both projection scenarios and calculated mean results. This procedure \n\nallowed us to attribute less weight to isolated small colonies, without completely excluding \n\ntheir importance from the final predictions. \n\n \n\nModel fitting procedures provided models with high AUC scores, for both training and test \n\ndatasets (Table 3). The minimum values for training and test AUC were 0.923 and 0.966, \n\nrespectively, meaning that all models have good predictive performances. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Training AUC, Test AUC and 10 percentile threshold scores for each seasonal model, calculated using \n\ndifferent species/gender group datasets. \n\n \n  AUC  10 PERCENTILE TRESHOLD \n\n  \nTraining \n\nAUC \n\nTest \n\nAUC \n \n\nTraining \n\nOmission \n\nRate \n\nTest \n\nOmission \n\nRate \n\nFractional \n\npredicted \n\narea \n\nSu\nm\n\nm\ner\n\n NGPM 0.968 0.983 \n\n \n\n \n\n 0.099 0.019 0.064 \nNGPF 0.972 0.985  0.095 0.022 0.052 \nSGPM 0.958 0.982  0.098 0.020 0.098 \nSGPF 0.923 0.969  0.098 0.032 0.179 \n\nW\nin\n\nte\nr \n\nNGPM 0.962 0.966  0.096 0.052 0.075 \nNGPF 0.971 0.978  0.099 0.016 0.054 \nSGPM 0.964 0.987  0.099 0.007 0.077 \nSGPF 0.929 0.969  0.100 0.018 0.175 \n\n \n\n \n\nJackknife test results show that dist_colgps is the most useful variable to explain the \n\ndistribution of each group, on both season, since it has the highest regularized training gain \n\nwith only variable (Figure 1). MaxEnt Jackknife analysis also selected as important variables, \n\nto all groups and for summer models, dist_seals, dist_cpeng and chla_sum. Regarding \n\nwinter models, jackknife results also identified sst_win, wspeed_win and chla_win as \n\nimportant variables to predict NGP male and female distributions; sst_win, chla_win and \n\nwdir_win are also important EGV to predict SGP male and female occurrence areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 - Jackknife test results for each seasonal species/sex group model: Northern Giant Petrel Males \n\n(SP1_SEX1), Northern Giant Petrel Females (SP1_SEX2), Southern Giant Petrel Males (SP2_SEX1) and \n\nSouthern Giant Petrel Females (SP2_SEX2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n\nThe summer distribution models predicted high-suitability areas centred around Giant \n\nPetrel colonies, although they differ for each group in the predicted extent of that area \n\n(Figure ). For instance, SGPF is the group with wider high-probability of occurrence areas \n\nduring summer months. On the other hand, NGPF is the group with shorter range high-\n\nprobability areas. Winter predictions are noticeably different for both species. Both SGP \n\ngroups have wider high-probability areas than NGP groups, and cells with higher scores are \n\nlocated more to the South, with a more evenly longitudinal distribution. SGPM have a \n\nbroader high-probability area than SGPF. For NGP males and females, the highest scores \n\nare located closer to land. NGPM winter model aggregates high-probability areas around \n\nlarge colonies, as well as around coastal areas (north coast of Argentina, Uruguay, South \n\nAfrica and Tasman Sea). NGPF winter model shows a similar distribution pattern, but in \n\ngeneral MaxEnt probability scores are lower than NGPM, meaning that it is harder to \n\npredict this group\u2019s winter distribution. \n\n \n\n \n\nPredictive models outputs show that, for both seasons, NGP have more fragmented \n\npotential occurrence areas than SGP. SGPM and SGPF occurrence areas suggest a higher \n\npotential for population connectivity over a larger region (presence/absence binary maps \n\navailable in Appendix supporting information). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Global predictive distribution maps based on the projection of each seasonal species/sex group \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 (cont.) - Global predictive distribution maps based on the projection of each seasonal species/sex \n\ngroup model. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nNiche overlap metrics (Schoener\u2019s D and Levins Niche Breath) are presented on Table 4 and \n\nTable 5 respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4 - Niche overlap (using Schoener\u2019s D niche overlap metric 0-1) between each group and season. \n\n \n SNGPM SNGPF SSGPM SSGPF WNGPM WNGPF WSGPM WSGPF \n\nSNGPM 1.00 0.67 0.62 0.62 0.66 0.65 0.60 0.67 \n\nSNGPF x 1.00 0.58 0.52 0.75 0.76 0.59 0.59 \n\nSSGPM x x 1.00 0.69 0.63 0.63 0.75 0.72 \n\nSSGPF x x x 1.00 0.61 0.59 0.68 0.78 \n\nWNGPM x x x x 1.00 0.80 0.57 0.60 \n\nWNGPF x x x x x 1.00 0.55 0.55 \n\nWSGPM x x x x x x 1.00 0.72 \n\nWSGPF x x x x x x x 1.00 \n\n \n\n \n \nTable 5 - Niche breadth (using Levins niche breadth metric 0-1) for each group and season. \n\n \n B1 (inverse concentration) B2 (uncertainty) \n\nSNGPM 0.451 0.924 \n\nSNGPF 0.365 0.898 \n\nSSGPM 0.392 0.906 \n\nSSGPF 0.684 0.968 \n\nWNGPM 0.397 0.902 \n\nWNGPF 0.359 0.890 \n\nWSGPM 0.388 0.899 \n\nWSGPF 0.591 0.951 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\nOne of the main challenges in SDM research involves the inclusion of ecologically relevant \n\nparameters. Some additional challenges involve the inclusion of migration processes, \n\ninclusion of theoretical information from population dynamics, incorporation of \n\ninterspecific biotic interactions and modelling functional groups of species (Guisan and \n\nThuiller 2005). Our models\u2019 results showed to be effective in addressing these tasks. We \n\nused presence-only data to generate ecological niche models that (1) describe the seasonal \n\nhabitat preferences, (2) generate seasonal predictive distribution maps and (3) model the \n\namount of niche overlap.  \n\n \n\nMaxEnt produced reliable seasonal distribution predictions for the 4 groups, based on \n\ndatasets with different number of occurrence records. Validation was also satisfactory, \n\ngiven the large amount of test data available for each group. Both Training and Test AUC \n\nscores were considerably high for every model, suggesting a good predictive performance \n\nin every case. \n\n \n\nThe coarse spatiotemporal scale approach used in our study may obscure relationships \n\nwith oceanographic features at a small scale, for instance those related with productivity, \n\nsuch as moving SST fronts or rich water masses. However, this is unlikely to significantly \n\naffect our modelling exercise, since seabird numbers are generally influenced by large scale \n\ncurrent systems and oceanographic features (Shealer 2002, Newton 2003).  \n\n \n\nOverall, summer ecological niches clearly reflect the fact that both species are central place \n\nforagers. During the breeding season, giant petrels must return to colony to change \n\nincubation shift or to feed the hatchlings during guarding and post-guarding period. In \n\nthese periods, male and female giant petrels share duties and alternate foraging trips that \n\ncan last from 1 to 30 days. Several studies show that at this time birds have the highest \n\nland-based activity, but also travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers to feeding areas. \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nLogically this is reflected on predictive maps, which show high-probability of occurrence \n\nareas centred on colonies.  \n\n \n\nGiant petrels\u2019 summer distribution seems to be strongly constrained by the proximity to \n\nbreeding colony. This is corroborated by the fact that the most important variable affecting \n\nall modelled summer distributions is distance to the breeding colony. The variables \n\ndist_seals and dist_cpeng also seem to be relevant to all summer models, and have higher \n\ntraining gain than both chla and sst (usually related with productivity). These results \n\nsupport the idea that during breeding season both species and sexes depend greatly on \n\ncarrion availability. Though, Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. (2007) suggested that intersexual \n\ndifferences in the exploitation of food resources seem greater than interspecific ones: \n\nduring incubation  males feed mainly on penguin and seal carcasses on shore, while females \n\nmostly forage at sea. Our results partially agree with this, with SSGPF niche breadth (for \n\nLevins metric) being clearly higher than the other groups (B1=0.684). Also, SSGPF predictive \n\nmaps show the wider high-probability of occurrence areas. However, SNGPF has niche \n\nbreadth score very similar to SNGPM and SSGPM. Furthermore, intraspecific niche overlap \n\nis higher than intersexual overlap. \n\n \n\nWhen comparing both species\u2019 summer results, it stands out that SGP have wider high-\n\nprobability of occurrence areas around colonies and a greater niche breadth than NGP. The \n\nwinter models present clear evidences of post-reproductive dispersal effects on \n\nlocalization of high-probability of occurrence areas, reflecting a latitudinal segregation \n\nbetween species. During wintering, NGP males and females high-probability of occurrence \n\nlocations are in northern areas near coast, continental shelf and shelf break. On the other \n\nhand, wintering SGP have a higher probability of occurrence on southern latitudes. Despite \n\neasy access to foraging habitats exploited by the other sibling species, SGP seem to prefer \n\nintraspecific competition rather than to compete with NGP. In this context, the observed \n\npattern probably arose from differences in their tolerance to the physical environment as \n\nwell as in their competitive abilities. \n\n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nGiant petrels are the seabirds with the highest wing loading, even higher than albatrosses \n\n(Obst &amp; Nagy 1992, Spear &amp; Ainley 1997), which presumably confers a greater flying \n\ncapability in strong wind conditions (Spear &amp; Ainley 1998). In particular, southern giant \n\npetrels males are heavier than females and than northern giant petrels having a greater \n\nwing loading (Pennycuick 1987). This may explain why southern giant petrel males tend to \n\nvisit southern areas in winter, where particularly strong winds may be disadvantageous for \n\ngiant petrel females and other large seabird species. \n\n \n\nWinter niche breadth scores are very similar to summer scores. This models\u2019 results show \n\nthe fundamental niche and the reduction on SGP might be related with the fact that during \n\nwinter there is a significant increase on sea ice around Antarctica, thus reducing the \n\npotential foraging grounds. Similarly to summer models, there is a higher intraspecific niche \n\noverlap than interspecific overlap. When comparing winter and summer Schoener\u2019s D \n\nresults for each group, it is clear that despite the high overlap between seasonal niches (D \n\nranging from 0.66 - 0.78), there is a level of differentiation to be considered. Also, there is \n\nan increase in niche overlap between sexes of the same species. This can be explained, \n\nbecause wintering giant petrels usually do not migrate to new areas but tend to disperse \n\nto areas similar to those used during the breeding season. However, being free of parental \n\nduties, birds usually remain in these areas for longer periods than during the breeding \n\nseason. \n\n \n\nThe two species seem to compete and share a common preference for the same \n\nenvironment. However, despite easy access to foraging habitats exploited by the other \n\nsibling species, southern giant petrels seem to prefer intraspecific competition rather than \n\nto compete with northern giant petrels. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n \nReferences \n\n \n\nAfanasyev, V. 2004.

The species \n\nbreeds in the southern region of Algarve, specifically in Ria Formosa. In this work we \n\nexplore the offshore habitat use of GPS tracked Portuguese AG during the breeding season \n\nin order to quantify the offshore area which might already be protected under the current \n\nSpecial Protection Area network in Portugal. The species breeding range at Deserta colony \n\nwas estimated using MaxEnt to develop spatial predictive models. We calculated the \n\npercentage of SPA area that covers each level of the estimated Core Area of AG occurrence \n\naround the colony. The current protected area as a reduced overlap with all the three Core \n\nArea levels selected, resulting in only ca. 4.6 to ca. 8.7% of the area used by the species \n\nbeing currently protected.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nRange shifts in many different taxa have been widely reported in recent decades (Hickling \n\net al. 2006; Chen et al. 2011). However, opportunities to identify the ecological factors \n\ninfluencing range expansion are rare, particularly at the spatial scales relevant to species-\n\nbased conservation strategies. Understanding species responses to environmental \n\nchanges, and particularly shifts in their range size and distribution, is therefore a major \n\ncurrent challenge for ecologists and conservationists (Thomas 2010; Guisan et al. 2013).The \n\ncapacity of species to shift distribution will depend upon the constraints imposed by habitat \n\nquality and availability, and the consequences for population growth and conservation will \n\ndepend on the fitness benefits associated with the occupation of new sites (Sutherland \n\n1996). Model systems therefore require well-quantified range changes and the capacity to \n\ntrack individuals in space and time. \n\n \n\nThe marine environment currently experiences fast climatic change most noticeably in key \n\nparameters such as Sea Surface Temperature (Brierley &amp; Kingsford 2009). This is likely to \n\ninfluence how organisms distribute themselves, with those species able of doing so, \n\npotentially expanding or shifting their ranges to areas previously unoccupied. But this \n\nhabitat is also a very a challenging one regarding the monitoring of species\u2019 spatial \n\ndistribution and until the last decade, very little was known regarding the distribution of \n\neven very large animals (e.g. whales). Most spatial information on marine animals was \n\ngathered by at sea surveys of direct observation or by tag recovery from fisheries or dead \n\nrecoveries on the shore, which incurred high levels of spatial uncertainty and temporal \n\nbiases. Recent advances in tracking technology, specifically the miniaturization of data \n\nloggers and transmitters have since allowed individual level tracking of most marine animal \n\ngroups, with seabirds being no exception (Croxall et al. 2005). In fact, developments aimed \n\nat seabird tracking have revolutionized tracking technology and devices such as \n\nGeolocators are currently used for individual tracking on other avian systems, e.g. \n\nshorebirds, passerines (Stutchbury et al. 2009, Conklin et al. 2010), even when positional \n\nerrors of Geolocators range between 100-200 km (Phillips et al. 2004, Clark et al. 2010). \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nCurrent technology offers GPS precision tracking with very light devices, allowing to \n\nresearch space use even of small seabird species, some of which with documented changes \n\non their distribution ranges, as in the case of Audouin\u2019s Gull Larus audouinii. \n\n \n\nCurrently, the Audouin\u2019s Gull (AG) has a global conservation status of Least Concern \n\n(BirdLife International 2015). This species breeds in Spain (19 461 breeding pairs) - mainly \n\nthe Chafarinas Islands and the Ebro Delta with the later holding 67% of the global \n\npopulation (14 177 in 2007 (Guti\u00e9rrez &amp; Guinart 2008), Algeria (100-600), Greece (350-\n\n500), Italy (1 153-1 286; Sardinia and Tuscan archipelago), having smaller colonies in \n\nPortugal (400-460), France (82; Corsica), Cyprus (14-28), Croatia (60-70), Turkey (47-90; \n\nislets and rocks in the southern Adriatic Sea near Korcula and Peljesac Peninsula),Tunisia \n\n(70-115) and Morocco (50-300) (all data for breeding pairs, BirdLife International 2015). It \n\nwinters along the coasts of North and West Africa from Libya to Morocco and along the \n\nAtlantic coasts of Africa in Mauritania, Gambia, Senegal and Gabon (Sanpera et al. 2007), \n\nwith a small wintering population in the eastern Mediterranean along the Aegean coast of \n\nTurkey (BirdLife International 2015). \n\n \n\nCurrent global population trend (most of it quantified in Europe and encompassing over \n\n90% of the entire species population), is considered stable or increasing (Barov &amp; Derh\u00e9 \n\n2011). This is thought to be mainly the result of increased availability of efficient protected \n\nareas during the 1980s, and also of discarded fish from trawlers. The effect of discarded \n\nfish was observed around the Ebro Delta (Criado 1997; Cama et al. 2013), where the colony \n\nhas grown rapidly since 1981 (Guti\u00e9rrez &amp; Guinart 2008). The large growth of this species \n\nin the western Mediterranean has likely caused the breeding population expansion into \n\nother locations both inside the Mediterranean, with new colonies found in Croatia, and \n\nalso one outside the Mediterranean, in southern Portugal (Birdlife International 2004). The \n\noccurrence of AG in Portugal is therefore a recent phenomenon (Catry et al. 2010), with \n\nthe species being considered to be threatened and classified as Vulnerable nationally, \n\nmostly due to the low numbers of breeding pairs (Cabral et al. 2005). The species breeds in \n\nthe southern region of Algarve, specifically in Ria Formosa. Current population is estimated \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nat 1 200 nesting pairs (J. Ramos, pers. comm.), following an initial colonization event \n\nrecorded in 2002 (Leal &amp; Lecoq 2005). Although this recent colonization was most likely \n\ndue to immigration of individuals from Spanish colonies, this can be considered as a \n\nfragmented subpopulation, given the high degree of isolation in relation to the most \n\nimportant breeding colonies (Cabral et al. 2005). In addition, individuals breeding in \n\nPortugal are the first recorded out of the species traditional Mediterranean breeding range \n\n(Equipa Atlas 2008).  \n\n \n\nHere we explore the offshore habitat use of GPS tracked Portuguese Audouin\u2019s Gull during \n\nthe breeding season in order to: (1) model the species habitat used based on \n\nenvironmental variables; and (2) quantify the offshore area which might already be \n\nprotected under the current Special Protection Area network in Portugal for this species. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 49 \n\n \n\nMethods \n\n \n\nGPS tracking \n\n \n\nBetween early May and late June 2015, 6 adults and 7 juvenile Audouin\u2019s Gulls were \n\ncaptured on nests and tagged with GPS/GSM dataloggers (Movetech/Fleetronic devices), \n\nat Deserta Island colony (36.963576\u00b0, -7.887174\u00b0), in Ria Formosa, southern Portugal. The \n\ndevices were equipped with high efficiency micro-solar panels to recharge the batteries \n\nand allow long-term remote tracking. The electronic equipment was sealed with \n\ntransparent heat-shrink tube providing resistance to salt water. The devices were attached \n\nto the back of the birds using a backpack system with chest harness, which has been \n\npreviously used in tracking studies with this and another sibling species elsewhere \n\n(Camphuysen et al. 2012; B\u00e9cares et al. 2015) and proven to be effective and safe for this \n\nspecies. The weight of the sealed devices plus the harness varied between 20 and 24g \n\n(depending on the battery capacity used), roughly representing 3\u20135% of the bird\u2019s body \n\nmass. The dataloggers were set to perform 15s wake-ups every 30 minutes. During the \n\nwake-up, location (Latitude/Longitude), instantaneous speed (m/s) and altitude (m) were \n\nregistered. GSM connection was set to every 6 hours with data being automatically \n\ndownloaded from the datalogger to a remote webserver, whenever GSM connection was \n\nsuccessfully established. Devices were programmed with a bootloader firmware, to \n\nprevent battery damage due to under or over charging. This firmware automatically \n\ncontrolled the device operation, whenever battery voltage was under 3,8V (switching it off \n\nuntil recharge) or above 4,1V (switching it on until battery voltage decreased). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nEnvironmental variables for Spatial Distribution Modelling  \n\n \n\nWhen developing Spatial Distribution Models (SDMs), the potential for overfitting \n\nincreases with model complexity (Franklin 2010), we decided to include in this analysis the \n\nminimum number of eco-geographical variables (EGV) considered relevant to explain \n\nspecies distributions (Table 6).  \n\nThe Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was obtained from the National Geographical Data \n\nCenter from U.S.A. (ETOPO2; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html), \n\nand resampled to a spatial resolution of 0.04167\u00b0. This also allowed calculating Slope using \n\nArcGIS software. DEM and Slope are topographic variables that are related, at sea, with \n\noceanographic dynamics and productivity (Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009; \n\nWakefield et al. 2009; B\u00e9cares et al. 2015) and, at land, with the altitude above sea level \n\nand terrain relief. Available evidence suggest that AG is a coastal species, that doesn\u2019t \n\nforage too far from shore (Cabral et al. 2005; Catry et al. 2010; Garc\u00eda-Tarras\u00f3n et al. 2015), \n\nhence Distance to coast was also added as explanatory variable. The variable Distance to \n\nCoast is provided as a global data set of distances to the nearest coastline and was acquired \n\nfrom http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/DistFromCoast/. All other distance variables \n\n(Distance to the breeding colony, Distance to ports and Distance to Ramsar sites) were \n\ncalculated as Cost Distance in ArcGIS. Distances of locations at sea were assigned with a \n\npositive value and locations at land with a negative one. The ports location and dimension \n\nwere obtained from http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/MAR.php. Ramsar sites \n\nlocation and information is available at https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris-search/. Distance to \n\nports was selected as variable because AGs are frequently recorded in flocks at fishing ports \n\n(Garc\u00eda-Tarras\u00f3n et al. 2015). Also they often follow fishing boats and the species is known \n\nfor its dependency on fishing discards (Garc\u00eda-Tarras\u00f3n et al. 2015). Distance to Ramsar \n\nsites was considered to be a relevant variable, because AG use inland wetlands, for example \n\nrice fields or salt marshes (Ruiz et al. 1996; Navarro et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2010; B\u00e9cares \n\net al. 2015; Garc\u00eda-Tarras\u00f3n et al. 2015).  \n\n  \n\nhttp://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/DistFromCoast/\nhttps://rsis.ramsar.org/ris-search/\n\n\n 51 \n\nTable 6 - List of eco-geographical variables considered for modelling purposes (the units, the original spatial \n\nresolution oSR, the temporal resolution TR and the source of data are presented for each variable). \n\n \nVariable Units oSR TR Source \n\n \n\nDigital Elevation Model; DEM \n\n \n\nmeters \n\n \n\n1\u2019 \nStatic \n\nhttp://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/i\n\nmage/2minrelief.html \n\nSlope; Slope percent rise 1\u2019 Static Derived from DEM \n\nDistance to coastline; \n\nDist_coast \ndegrees 0.31\u2019 Static \n\nhttp://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\nDOCS/DistFromCoast/. \n\nDistance to the breeding \n\ncolony; Dist_colony* \ndegrees 0.31\u2019 2015 Calculated using central point. \n\nDistance to ports; Dist_ports* degrees 0,31\u2019 2015 \nhttp://www.worldportsource.co\n\nm/ports/MAR.php \n\nPorts; ports \n\nBinary \n\ncategorical \n\nvariable \n\n4km 2015 \nhttp://www.worldportsource.co\n\nm/ports/MAR.php \n\nDistance to Ramsar Sites; \n\nDist_RAMSAR* \ndegrees 0,31\u2019 2015 \n\nhttps://rsis.ramsar.org/ris-\n\nsearch/ \n\nRamsar Sites; RAMSAR \n\nBinary \n\ncategorical \n\nvariable \n\n   \n\nChlorophyll Concentration; \n\nCHL_month \nmg/m3 4km Monthly http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \n\nSea Surface Temperature; \n\nSST_month \n\nbrightness \n\ntemperature \n4km Monthly http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \n\nNight Sea Surface Temperature; \n\nNSST_month \n\nbrightness \n\ntemperature \n4km Monthly http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \n\n* These variables were excluded from the model due to strong correlation with Dist_coast, which is the \nmore generic variable. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, we obtained monthly data, at spatial resolution of 0.04167\u00b0, of Sea Surface \n\nTemperature (night and day average), Night Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll \n\nConcentration from Aqua-MODIS satellite imagery, available from \n\nhttp://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/.

Sea Surface Temperature \n\nand Chlorophyll a concentration are considered to directly reflect ocean productivity and \n\nfood availability. Night Sea Surface Temperature was included in the variables list, due to \n\nthe reported AG\u2019s nocturnal foraging habits (Garc\u00eda-Tarras\u00f3n et al. 2015 and Rodrigues \n\n2015, unpublished data). All variables were resampled to the coarsest spatial resolution \n\n(0.04167\u00b0), using a geographic coordinate system in WGS-1984 datum. We compared \n\nmodels results including different sets of predictive variables and evaluated which had \n\nbetter predictive performance. In order to identify and eliminate strongly correlated \n\nvariables (|r|>0.7) prior to the modelling process, ENM Tools software was used to conduct \n\na Pearson Correlation test (Warren et al. 2010) (Supplementary Material A). \n\n \n\n \n\nModelling procedures \n\n \n\nModel training and testing was performed with MaxEnt software. MaxEnt is one of the \n\nmost widely used modelling packages, most likely due to: (1) is one of the most practical \n\nmethods for modelling species distributions; (2) it typically outperforms other algorithms \n\nbased on predictive accuracy; (3) it requires only presence data plus environmental \n\ninformation for the entire study area. Thus, MaxEnt is a very useful solution to analyse \n\ntracking data, given it only provides information about species occurrence. Detailed \n\ndescription of the MaxEnt and its mathematical computations are given in Phillips et al. \n\n(2006), Elith et al. (2010) and Merow et al. (2013). We set MaxEnt to remove duplicate \n\npresence records from the same grid cell to minimize autocorrelation biases. The functional \n\nforms (known as \u201cfeature types\u201d) selection was set to the default option \u201cAuto Features\u201d.  \n\n \n\nTo account for the effects of geographical sampling bias in the acquisition of data, we \n\nproduced separate sampling bias grids for each monthly tracking dataset using SDMtoolbox \n\nfor ArcGIS. This tool creates a bias file for coordinate data (BFCD, downloadable from \n\nwww.sdmtoobox.org) that is clipped to the size of the study area and then constrained to \n\n\n\n 53 \n\na buffered area around occurrence points. This file accounts for background and \n\npseudoabsence sampling biases associated with latitudinal changes in the area \n\nencompassed by decimal degree units and it can be used as a bias file in MaxEnt. This \n\ninequality results from convergence of the meridians. The BFCD allows equal sampling of \n\nbackground throughout the landscape in geographic projections (Syfert et al. 2013; Brown \n\n2014). \n\n \n\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) was used to test \n\neach model\u2019s discriminative ability. The Jackknife test of variable importance was used to \n\nevaluate the relative importance of each predictor variable considered on each model. The \n\ntraining gain is calculated for each variable alone, as well as the drop in training gain when \n\nthe variable is omitted from the full model (Peterson et al. 2007; Phillips 2008a). The \n\nrelative importance of each variable was also analysed, as well as the variables response \n\ncurves (details in Syfert et al. 2013). Model evaluation was done by cross-validation, \n\nrandomly splitting occurrence data into a number of equal-size groups (folds) and models \n\nare trained leaving out each fold in turn. This approach has a big advantage, which is using \n\nall data for evaluation (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips 2008b). \n\n \n\n \n\nNiche Overlap \n\n \n\nWe measured the similarity in predictions between all pairs of SDMs produced by \n\nquantifying the niche overlap. We used ENMtools software to calculate the Schoener\u2019s D \n\nstatistics (Warren et al. 2008). It ranges from 0 to 1, with zero indicating no niche overlap \n\nbetween model solutions and one indicating identical predicted distributions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n \n\nCore Area definition  \n\n \n\nTo define a core area of AG occurrence around the breeding colony, based not only on \n\ntracked locations but also on environmental predictors, we used the averaged overall \n\nmodel to select areas with aggregated cells (at least 3) having a mean logistic value higher \n\nthan 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7. We used ArcGIS 10.3 to plot contour lines and obtain vector layers \n\nfor these three Core Area levels. We then compared the results with the present spatial \n\ncoverage of the Portuguese SPA network, to analyse potential conservation implications. \n\nWe calculated the percentage of SPA area that covers each level of the estimated Core Area \n\nand the percentage of Core Area already under SPA designation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 55 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nModel evaluation and variables contribution  \n\n \n\nAll three monthly SDMs showed a good (0.9>AUC > 0.8) to excellent (AUC > 0.9) ability to \n\npredict the habitat used by the AG, during the breeding season (Table 7). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 7 - Training AUC, AUC Standard Deviation (SD) and Test AUC values resulting from model evaluation \n\nand cross validation. \n\n \nMonthly Model Training AUC AUC SD Test AUC \n\nMay 0,8804 0,0324 0,8429 \n\nJune 0,8630 0,0335 0,8176 \n\nJuly 0,9005 0,0364 0,8674 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe most relevant variables to the monthly models (Figure 3) were Dist_coast (May and \n\nJune) and SST_month (July), with both variables negatively influence probability of \n\noccurrence (variables response curves included Supplementary Material B). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Variables\u2019 percent contribution to each monthly model.

There seems to be a consistency in terms of spatial use \n\nduring incubation (May) and chick-rearing periods (June and July). The areas with higher \n\nprobability of occurrence values are very similar in the three monthly models solutions. \n\nThis fact is also reflected in the Schoener\u2019s D statistics (Table 8), which indicates high niche \n\noverlap for every pairwise comparison (ca. 0.8). Thus, a monthly average distribution map \n\nwas calculated in order to obtain robust breeding season potential area of occurrence \n\naround the breeding colony. \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 Niche overlap using Schoener's D statistic test.

This is a particularly interesting result as the Portuguese population is \n\nmost likely an extension of the Spanish, which has its stronghold in Ebro Delta, hosting \n\nmore than two thirds of the entire breeding population (BirdLife International 2016). \n\nPopulation growth and expansion to new locations is attributed to the increased availability \n\nof fisheries discards close to key breeding colonies, particularly in the Ebro Delta where \n\nwaste from the trawlers is not used industrially to produce food for domestic animals, as \n\noccurs in other areas, and its rather discarded near the colony (Guti\u00e9rrez &amp; Guinart 2008). \n\nFishing discards and the creation of protected areas in the 1980s are regarded as the main \n\ncauses for the population recovery (Criado 1997), which increased from only 1000 pairs in \n\n1975 to 21 161 in the present and current population is stable or increasing (Guti\u00e9rrez &amp; \n\nGuinart 2008; Barov &amp; Derh\u00e9 2011). In Portugal however, and despite the very costal \n\ndistribution of the species, the current protected area has a reduced overlap with all of the \n\nthree Core Area levels selected, resulting in only ca. 4.6 to ca. 8.7% of the area used by the \n\nspecies being currently protected.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe use of new GPS/GSM technology provided good results, likely due to the proximity to \n\nareas with good GSM cover in coastal Algarve (South Portugal). Tracking data was thus of \n\ngood quality and frequency allowing to create good predictions of occurrence using MaxEnt \n\nand based on the selected environmental variables. For all breeding months AUC values \n\nbased on the tracking dataset (using 10 folds of the empirical tracking dataset to replicate \n\nmonthly model calculations) were above 0.8 providing high confidence estimates of AG \n\noccurrence (Syfert et al. 2013). The variables that most contributed to the monthly models \n\nwere Dist_coast (May and June) and SST (July) (Figure 3). Dist_coast is strongly correlated \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nwith the excluded variable Dist_colony and it is reasonable to assume that this variable \n\nreflects the species coastal behaviour, as well as, the limited foraging range in close \n\nproximity to the colony location, especially during incubation. SST is a proxy for productivity \n\nthat contributes considerably when adults are in the later stages of chick-rearing period \n\n(July). B\u00e9cares et al. (2015) in the Mediterranean found that Dist_colony, Dist_ports (both \n\nnegatively affecting occurrence probability), CHL_month and SST_month were the most \n\nrelevant variables on their predictive models of AGs foraging habitats. Those models were \n\nbased on a larger set of environmental and ecological variables (16 in total), indicating that \n\nalbeit being in a recently occupied location this species relies on the same environmental \n\npredictors as on the traditional colony with the exception of Ports, which is of little \n\nrelevance in Portugal. This may be due to the fact that we used a binary variable in our \n\nmodels to avoid correlation between distance variables. It may be also due to ecological \n\ndifferences in both areas, since Spanish ports have large fishing fleets whereas this is not \n\nthe case in Portugal and potentially aggravated by the fact that AGs in the Portuguese \n\ncolony are yet to learn how to explore the discards in the vicinity of ports (see below). Also, \n\ntrawl fleet in Algarve region is relatively small and is mostly concentrated in Portim\u00e3o \n\nharbour (about 60km away, in straight line, from the colony). Purse seine and polyvalent \n\nfleets (that operate on the other ports of Algarve) do not generate large amount of discards \n\nand offal, as the trawl fleet does. This way AG might feel more attracted to areas where \n\ntrawlers operate, along the continental shelf break. Conversely, DEM and Slope contributed \n\nconsiderably on our predictive models but not in the Mediterranean (B\u00e9cares et al. 2015). \n\nDistinct bathymetry between the two foraging areas can potentially justify these \n\ndifferences, as depths in costal Mediterranean (a mostly inland sea) are much lower and \n\nvary less in slope than in the Portuguese Atlantic coast. Regardless of the methodological \n\nand fine differences between these studies, both highlight the overwhelming contribution \n\nof distance to colony or coast and productivity for predicting this species distribution during \n\nbreeding season.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nThe absence from Mediterranean waters of Audouin\u2019s Gull breeding in Portugal indicates \n\nthat these individuals are not dependent on the traditional foraging areas of this species. \n\nThis has occurred in a relatively short time (generation length estimated by BirdLife \n\nInternational to be 13 years, BirdLife International 2016), as the colony has only 13 years, \n\nindicating that colonizer individuals likely started using new foraging grounds as early as \n\nsettlement occurred. Furthermore, it indicates that this thriving breeding population is \n\nindependent from the local scale fluctuations recorded in the Spanish colonies (Barov &amp; \n\nDerh\u00e9 2011). Given the forecasted decline in the unsustainable trawling fishery of the \n\nlargest colony, the Ebro Delta, (Oro et al. 2004; Tavecchia et al. 2007; Barov &amp; Derh\u00e9 2011) \n\nand the potential reduction of small pelagic fish stocks due to increasingly high fishing \n\npressure around the Mediterranean breeding grounds, owing partly to high demand of fish \n\nfeed from tuna-farming (Arcos et al. 2008), the Portuguese breeding colony might \n\ntherefore gain regional relevance in the near future. Although some fish stocks in \n\nPortuguese waters are potentially under pressure (sardines, hake, etc.) (ICES 2015a, \n\n2015b), the local AG colony is increasing while others remain stable. This indicates the \n\nurgency in projecting protected areas encompassing the species foraging grounds given the \n\ncurrent scenario of fishing stock reductions. The Core Area delimitation for the averaged \n\noverall model shows the species vital area during breeding season ranked in 3 importance \n\nlevels for conservation. At the moment this area should be considered as the most \n\nimportant to ensure species conservation in Portugal. \n\n \n\n \n\nDespite the low spatial variation on distribution during the breeding season, there is a \n\ntendency for predicted areas of occurrence to have a wider latitudinal range in May and a \n\nwider longitudinal range in June, than in July. This is probably a consequence of the timing \n\nof breeding season events, as May and part of June will very much refer to incubation, \n\nwhen both adults can do larger trips from the colony to feed themselves, whereas July will \n\nmostly encompass chick rearing phase, when regular feeding of small food items is \n\nrequired, likely keeping adults at short distances from the colony (Ma\u00f1osa et al. 2004; \n\nBurger et al. 2016). However, and given that the Schoener's D statistic revealed very high \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nniche overlap between the breeding season months these were all averaged into one \n\n(Warren et al. 2008). This is also supported by the need to protect areas used throughout \n\nthe breeding season given that selecting only one stage (or month) of this period could \n\nresult in decreased fitness. For example, if only offshore areas used during late incubation \n\nin June are protected, then unprotected coastal sites important during chick rearing could \n\npotentially result in low feeding rates and consequent depressed chick development and \n\neven pre-fledging mortality (Vigfusdottir et al. 2013). It is therefore important to plan \n\nintegrated conservation areas ensuring that all stages of the breeding season are \n\naccounted for. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nArcos, J.M., M.

In this \n\nstudy, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization for marine birds across mainland \n\nPortuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), in preparation of eventual future expansion of \n\nthe current conservation area networks and definition of MPAs, as well as, for the \n\nimplementation of management plans on currently established SPAs, with particular focus \n\non offshore areas. Our results address many of the conceptual planning needs Portugal has \n\nfor the marine environment. Some of the identified key areas are located in regions thought \n\nto be important for marine biodiversity, due to their environmental characteristics. The \n\nfinal results are also very relevant to undertake in the future best practice management \n\nactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 74 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nThe designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is currently considered one of the best \n\nsolutions to ensure the protection of relevant marine species and habitats (Kelleher 1999). \n\nIn a long-term perspective, and besides its primary aim for the conservation of target \n\nspecies and/or habitats, MPAs can also play an important role in restoration of \n\noverharvested and heavily exploited ecosystems. It is therefore essential that the design of \n\nMPAs is based upon robust information on species occurrence and spatial distribution, as \n\nwell as, on the association between that empirical record and oceanographic \n\nenvironmental variables. In the marine environment, the mechanisms that regulate species \n\noccurrence are still widely debated. Nevertheless, species occurrence and spatial \n\ndistribution data of target species are essential for the implementation of management \n\nplans, and to evaluate the effectiveness and success of these conservation tools and should \n\nthus form the base of MPA design and evaluation procedures. \n\nOne of the key challenges that the European Union (EU) biodiversity policy currently faces, \n\nis the full implementation of the Natura 2000 network in the marine environment. The \n\nimplementation of MPAs is often hindered by legal difficulties in defining reserves on \n\ninternational waters, the patchy nature of data in many offshore waters and/or by the \n\nscarcity of comprehensive data and studies describing long term biological patterns for \n\nmultiple species, particularly in offshore waters (Leathwick et al. 2008). Seabirds are \n\nrelatively easy to monitor offshore as these can be recorded from a boat by direct \n\nobservation and can be used as a starting point for the mapping of potential MPAs, which \n\nmight originate from Important Bird Areas (IBA). In the EU, the identification and \n\ndelimitation of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for seabirds must be entirely based on \n\nscientific criteria, such as the percentage of the population of a priority species under the \n\nBirds Directive, although Member States have a margin of discretion in determining the \n\nmost appropriate criteria (Stroud et al. 2001). In any case, countries must fully apply those \n\ncriteria in a way that ensures that all the \u2018most suitable territories\u2019, both in number and \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nsurface area, are designated for protection. Based on the information provided by the \n\nMember States, the European Commission evaluates if the designated sites are sufficient \n\nto form a coherent network for the protection of the vulnerable and migratory species \n\nusing EU\u2019s waters (European Commission 2007). \n\nBetween 2012 and 2015, Portugal made an important step towards the implementation of \n\nNatura 2000 network in the marine environment, by enlarging and establishing new marine \n\nSpecial Protection Areas (SPAs) for priority species under the Birds Directive (Decree-Law \n\nn. 105/2012, Regulatory Decree n. 17/2015 and Decree-Law n. 204/2015). Although, this \n\nprocess was mainly aimed towards the designation of marine SPAs for the conservation of \n\nthe following species: Puffinus mauretanicus, Oceanodroma castro, Morus bassanus, \n\nMelanitta nigra and Calonectris diomedea. Despite being a multi-species approach, most \n\nof the rare and non-threatened species were not considered in the analysis, which led to \n\nthe definition of SPAs only in territorial sea (until 12nm). Consequently, no relevant \n\noffshore areas were found to be relevant for designation as marine SPAs. The recent \n\npublication of the Portuguese Atlas of Marine Birds (Meirinho et al. 2014) allows now \n\nconsidering all seabird species for the designation of SPAs offshore. This timely Atlas, \n\npresents the seasonal distributions of all seabird species that occur on Portuguese waters \n\n(Meirinho et al. 2014) and for most of the species it contains seasonal Spatial Distribution \n\nModels, based on a large set of environmental predictors, therefore being an useful tool \n\nfor marine spatial planning and management. Data collection protocols allowed gathering \n\ninformation with a good temporal and spatial resolution encompassing a relatively large \n\nstudy period (December 2004 to December 2012). SDMs were developed using MaxEnt \n\nsoftware, which is now considered to be a common SDM tool, as it is very simple to use \n\nand is especially efficient in handling complex iterations between response and predictor \n\nvariables (Elith et al. 2006, 2010; Fourcade et al. 2014). \n\nThe purpose of SDMs, and in particular of predictive mapping, is to provide spatially explicit \n\ninformation on species and other elements of biodiversity for conservation planning. Grid-\n\nbased atlases of species distribution have been widely used to collect data on distribution \n\nof different species, especially birds and can be used to obtain information about species-\n\n\n\n 76 \n\nenvironment relationships using these type of quantitative models. These studies have the \n\nadvantage of using systematic methodologies to collect data about species distributions \n\n(Franklin 2010), hence the protocols can be replicated at different times, allowing to \n\nconduct long term monitoring studies. In recent years a novel approach to developing \n\nSDM\u2019s has been gaining attention due to its integrative model: Spatial Conservation \n\nPlanning (SCP). This is a multidisciplinary approach that relies on inputs from several fields, \n\nsuch as spatial ecology, economy, geography or sociology and aims to identify important \n\nareas for biodiversity and efficiently achieve conservation goals (Lindenmayer &amp; Hunter \n\n2010; Reyers et al. 2010; Kukkala &amp; Moilanen 2013). One of the most important steps in \n\nSCP is termed \u201cspatial conservation prioritization\u201d. This step requires the use of decision \n\nsupport systems and planning software, based on complex mathematical algorithms, to \n\nidentify important areas for conservation or protected network expansion (Pressey &amp; \n\nBottrill 2009; Kukkala &amp; Moilanen 2013). There are several decision support systems and \n\nplanning software available to select areas with good habitat quality and connectivity. One \n\nsuch software frequently used is Zonation which includes a set of useful features, most \n\nnoticeably allows for uncertainty analysis, species weighting and seven ways of dealing \n\nwith connectivity (Lehtom\u00e4ki &amp; Moilanen 2013).  \n\n \n\nIn this study, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization for marine birds across \n\nmainland Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), in preparation of eventual future \n\nexpansion of the current conservation area networks and definition of MPAs, as well as, for \n\nthe implementation of management plans on currently established SPAs. Our approach is \n\nbased on decision-theoretic and optimization techniques, specifically using Zonation \n\nspatial planning software (Lehtom\u00e4ki et al. 2009; Kukkala &amp; Moilanen 2013). The main \n\ninnovation in this technique is the multi-specific approach that aggregates seasonal SDMs \n\nfor a large number of marine bird species occurring on the study area (common, rare, \n\nthreatened and not-threatened) and the ability to combine these for identifying important \n\nconservation areas both offshore, in-shore, seasonally and overall. \n\n \n\n\n\n 77 \n\n \n\nMethods \n\n \n\nData Collection \n\nSurvey data was collected following the protocols developed for Portuguese Atlas of \n\nMarine Birds (for details see Meirinho et al. 2014). In short, from December 2004 to \n\nDecember 2012 ship-board surveys were conducted off the coast of Portugal and western \n\nAndalusia, broadly between 34\u00b0N and 42\u00b0N, and 6\u00b0W and 14\u00b0W. Most of the survey effort \n\nwas carried out between March and November of each year, with fewer surveys from \n\nDecember through February. Standard protocols of European Seabirds at Sea data \n\ncollection were used (Tasker et al. 1984; Camphuysen &amp; Garthe 2004) on board four similar \n\nresearch vessels. All seabirds in contact with water within 300 m of the survey transect \n\nwere counted on one side of the ship, and all flying seabirds were counted using the \u2018snap-\n\nshot method\u2019, with bird observations summed over 5 min periods.  \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental predictors \n\n \n\nTo model seabird species distribution, 19 environmental variables were selected (Table 10). \n\nThese variables are either known, or expected, to be \u2018usually\u2019 correlated with seabird \n\ndistribution and abundance (e.g. Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009a, 2009b; \n\nWakefield et al. 2009). The oceanographic data were obtained from Bloom-Watch 180, as \n\nremote sensing products (i.e. satellite imagery). Physical variables (e.g. bathymetry) were \n\nextracted only once since they are static over the study period. Dynamic oceanographic \n\nvariables (e.g. Sea Surface Temperature \u2013 sst) were extracted as monthly averages, from \n\nAqua MODIS and Pathfinder AVHRR satellite imagery, and varied among seasons and years \n\nduring the study period.  \n\n\n\n 78 \n\nThe effect of environmental variables on ocean productivity is not immediate, as in many \n\ncases there is a delay between some oceanographic phenomenon and prey occurrence. In \n\norder to account for productivity time lags we integrated Sea Surface (sst) and Chlorophyll \n\na Concentration (chla) over a period of three months prior to each season: Winter, Spring, \n\nSummer and Autumn (Louzao et al. 2009). To account for annual anomalies we included \n\nthe sst and chla anomalies (i.e. asst and achla) for each season, calculated as the difference \n\nbetween the average value for a given season and year and the average for that season \n\nover a 20-year period in that grid cell. Given that seabirds may respond to spatial gradients \n\nof oceanographic variables (Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009a; Wakefield et al. \n\n2009), we also calculated spatial sst and chla gradients as: (maximum value x minimum \n\nvalue) x 100/maximum value; with maximum being the highest and minimum the lowest \n\nseasonal mean sst or chla value over a moving 3 x 3 grid cell window (i.e. 144km2). This \n\ndimensionless metric expresses the magnitude of change in each habitat variable, scaled \n\nto the maximum value. The spatial gradients of chlorophyll a (gchla) and sea surface \n\ntemperature (gsst) indicate the presence of frontal systems, whereas the gradient of \n\nbathymetry (gbat) reflects the presence of topographic features (e.g. shelf break or \n\nseamount). Finally, we used the sla in each season as an indicator of mesoscale structures \n\nthat mix additional nutrients up into to the surface layer.  \n\nTo evaluate the persistence of productive zones in the study area, we used chlorophyll a \n\nconcentration datasets for the study period. Global persistency was calculated in 2 steps: \n\n1) for any given year, in each seasonal chla map (3 months), we identified cells with high \n\nnutrient concentration (chla > 1 mg m3); 2) for each pixel, we counted the number of \n\nseasonal maps with high nutrient concentration. \n\nEnvironmental variables considered in the analytical process are shown in Table 10. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 79 \n\n \n\nTable 10 \u2013 List of environmental variables used on species distribution models. \n\n \nVariable Data source \n\nMin.

Every grid cell received an \n\nadditional binary detection/non-detection value of \u20181\u2019 (hereafter referred to as \u2018presence\u2019), \n\nwhereas grid cells that were surveyed but where no target seabird species were observed \n\nwere coded as \u20180\u2019 (hereafter referred to as \u2018absence\u2019). \n\n \n\nModel construction  \n\nModel construction, training and testing was performed with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) \n\nmodelling based on presence-only data (version 3.3.3 (http://www.cs. \n\nprinceton.edu/~schapire/maxent/ [accessed 18 October 2012]). MaxEnt is a general-\n\npurpose method for characterizing probability distributions from incomplete information. \n\nIn estimating the probability distribution defining a species\u2019 distribution across a study \n\narea, MaxEnt formalizes the principle that the estimated distribution must agree with \n\neverything that is known (or inferred from the environmental conditions where the species \n\nhas been observed), but should avoid making any assumptions that are not supported by \n\nthe data. The approach is thus to find the probability distribution of maximum entropy (the \n\ndistribution that is most spread-out, or closest to uniform) subject to constraints imposed \n\nby the information available regarding the observed distribution of the species and \n\nenvironmental conditions across the study area.  \n\nThe MaxEnt method does not require absence data for the species being modelled; instead \n\nit uses background environmental data for the entire study area. The method can use both \n\ncontinuous and categorical variables and the output is a continuous prediction (i.e. a \n\ncumulative probability ranging from 0 to 1 that indicates relative suitability).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 81 \n\n \n\nModel evaluation and calibration  \n\nWe divided the survey data into training and test datasets by setting aside approximately \n\n30% of the surveyed area for spatial evaluation of the models (Ara\u00fajo &amp; Guisan 2006). We \n\nfirst ran MaxEnt on the presence-only positions 100 times and then calculated the mean of \n\nthe 100 MaxEnt predictions, to obtain an average prediction and coefficient of variation of \n\nthose predictions. MaxEnt program was run separately for different species and seasons \n\n(i.e. winter, spring, summer, autumn). The settings were: logistic output format, resulting \n\nin values between 0 and 1 for each grid cell, where higher values indicate more similar \n\nclimatic conditions; duplicates removed; and 100 replicate runs of random (bootstrap) \n\nsubsamples with 30 as random test percentage. The results were summarized as the \n\naverage of the 100 models. There are three main results of MaxEnt; jackknife chart, \n\nReceiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC) and probability map. Jackknife chart was \n\nused to evaluate the contribution of each environmental layer to the final result, thus \n\nproviding the explanatory power of each variable when used in isolation. The ROC curve \n\ndescribes the model\u2019s accuracy measured by the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The \n\nAUC estimates the likelihood that a randomly selected presence point is located in a raster \n\ncell with a higher probability value for species occurrence than a randomly generated point \n\n(Phillips et al. 2006). Generated models are generally interpreted as excellent for test AUC \n\n> 0.90, good for 0.80 &lt;AUC &lt;0.90, acceptable for 0.70 &lt;AUC &lt;0.80, bad for 0.60 &lt;AUC &lt;\n\n0.70 and invalid for 0.50 &lt;AUC &lt;0.60 (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2005). All model evaluation statistics \n\nand optimal thresholds were calculated using the package \u2018PresenceAbsence\u2019 in R 2.15. (R \n\nDevelopment Core Team 2012). Finally, the probability map shows the spatial distribution \n\nof predicted presence probability and is used for graphical representation of the \n\ndistribution data.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 82 \n\n \nSpatial prioritization  \n\n \nIn the second phase of this analysis, we used Zonation 4.0.0 to perform a spatial \n\nprioritization analysis, based on statistical seasonal seabird distributions models, to identify \n\nrelevant marine conservation areas. Zonation is based on the specification of priorities and \n\nconnectivity responses for biodiversity features (Moilanen 2007; Leathwick et al. 2008). \n\nZonation algorithm starts by assuming that the full landscape is protected, and proceeds \n\nby progressively identifying and removing cells that cause the smallest marginal loss in \n\nconservation value. Low conservation cells are removed first, leaving high conservation grid \n\ncells to last, which correspond to the important conservation areas (Moilanen 2007; \n\nMoilanen et al. 2014). The first and most important part of the analysis is the meta-\n\nalgorithm selection, which will define the marginal loss. Here, we used the Core Area \n\nZonation (CAZ) meta-algorithm. CAZ aims to ensure high-quality locations for all species, \n\nincluding those that occur in otherwise species poor areas (Leathwick et al. 2008; \n\nLehtom\u00e4ki &amp; Moilanen 2013). Therefore, CAZ it is able to identify as high-priority areas that \n\nhave a high occurrence level for a single rare and/or highly weighted feature (Minin et al. \n\n2014). Succinctly CAZ uses the following principles: (1) of two otherwise equal locations, \n\nthat with a lower occurrence for the most important species is removed first; (2) assuming \n\ntwo otherwise equal locations, that with the occurrence of a lower-weight species is \n\nremoved before that with an equal occurrence for a high-priority species; (3) assuming two \n\nidentical locations with identical original occurrence levels for two different species, the \n\none retained is that which contains a species that has lost more of its distribution; (4) of \n\ntwo otherwise identical locations, that with higher cost is removed first (Moilanen 2007; \n\nLeathwick et al. 2008; Moilanen et al. 2014). \n\nSpecies were assigned with different priority weights, based on their national conservation \n\nstatus (Table 11) and their phenology in the study area (Table 12). We attributed a score to \n\neach of the categories of these 2 criteria, as shown in. For each species, overall weights \n\nwere calculated by multiplying the 2 scores (Supplementary Material C).  \n\n\n\n 83 \n\n \n\nTable 11 - Conservation status categories and attributed scores for calculation of zonation species weights. \n\n \n\nConservation Status Attributed weight \nLeast Concern (LC) 1 \nNear Threatened (NT) 1,5 \nVulnerable (VU) 2 \nEndangered (EN) 3 \nCritically Endangered (CR) 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 12 - Phenological status categories and attributed scores for calculation of zonation species weights . \n\n \n\nPhenological Status Attributed weight \nVisitor / Winter Visitor 1 \nMigratory reproductor 1,5 \nReproductor 2 \nResident 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMethods for reserve selection and conservation planning often ignore uncertainty. For \n\nexample, presence-absence observations and predictions of habitat models are used as \n\ninputs but commonly assumed to be without error. But zonation provides an uncertainty \n\nanalysis feature aiming at robust conservation decisions (Moilanen et al. 2006b, 2014). \n\nUncertainty analysis provides a consistent framework for understanding potential \n\nconsequences of errors in inputs and achieve a given conservation target, despite \n\nuncertainty in data. Zonation applies one particular branch of decision theory, information-\n\ngap theory, to conservation planning based on probabilities of occurrence. The underlying \n\nmethod is the \u201cdistribution discounting\u201d, in which the site- and species-specific measure of \n\nconservation value (related to species-specific occupancy probabilities) was penalized by \n\nan error measure (in our study, related to accuracy of statistical prediction) (Moilanen et \n\nal. 2006a, 2006b).  \n\n\n\n 84 \n\n \n\nFor each seasonal species distribution model, a corresponding uncertainty map was \n\ncalculated on MaxEnt. These uncertainty layers represent the Standard Deviation (SD) of \n\nthe probability of occurrence estimates.  \n\n \n\nWe selected Zonation to perform a spatial priority rank analysis for each season (Spring, \n\nSummer, Autumn and Winter). The informative layers used in this spatial analysis include, \n\nfor each season, a total of 34 (Spring), 22 (Summer), 34 (Autumn) and 20 (Winter) seasonal \n\nspecies predictive and uncertainty maps obtained with MaxEnt (seasonal species maps are \n\navailable online at http://www.atlasavesmarinhas.pt/ for detailed information on species \n\noccurrence).  \n\nWe carried out four analyses that identified seasonal high priority conservation areas for \n\nseabirds across mainland Portugal. The spatial area considered for this study includes the \n\ncontinental Portuguese EEZ (offshore area), territorial and interior waters (inshore area). \n\nWe then used the seasonal results to identify high priority offshore areas for seabird \n\nconservation, by extracting the results using an offshore area mask. We then combined the \n\n4 seasonal solutions in a mosaic raster by selecting the blend option in ArcGIS 10.3 mosaic \n\nto new raster tool.  \n\nTo identify the best offshore areas for seabird conservation, we selected the 10% Top \n\nFraction of the combined final solution. According with Lehtom\u00e4ki &amp; Moilanen (2013) the \n\nbest top fraction values to identify the best areas for conservation typically varies between \n\n2% and 20%. We selected an intermediate value in this range that outputted satisfactory \n\nresults and ensures that these areas contain a balanced representation of all features \n\n(habitat type and/or species distributions) included in the analysis (Kremen et al. 2008; \n\nLehtom\u00e4ki &amp; Moilanen 2013). \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.atlasavesmarinhas.pt/\n\n\n 85 \n\n \nResults \n\n \nThe generic results allowed to identify four seasonal high priority conservation areas for \n\nseabirds across mainland Portugal. The seasonal results are presented in priority rank \n\nmaps, shown in Figure 7. For better visualization of seasonal results, the four maps show \n\nthe wider distribution of the best areas for conservation identified by the highest-ranked \n\ncells in the 20% top fraction. These generic results are the baseline analysis, based on \n\nseasonal multispecies distribution datasets and on a well supported analysis \n\nparameterization which accounts for predictive uncertainty. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7- Seasonal high priority areas for seabirds across mainland Portugal.

The \n\noverexploitation and the increase of human pressure on marine environment has amplified \n\nthe need to identify and conserve important ecosystems at sea (Smith et al. 2014). \n\nImplementation of efficient MPAS, management plans and conservation actions for \n\nseabirds demands robust information on species distribution during each phenological \n\nstage of its life cycle. Furthermore, important seabird areas constitute valuable information \n\ntoward marine conservation efforts, as they can be indicative of productivity hotspots for \n\na diversity of life, including primary producers, invertebrates, fish, and/or marine mammals \n\n(Piatt et al. 2007; Suryan et al. 2012). Marine IBAs can therefore provide a starting point \n\nfor establishing legal protections, such as MPAs or SPAs, because they are designed using \n\nobservational data and a standardized global criteria (Nur et al. 2011; Ronconi &amp; Clair 2012; \n\nLascelles et al. 2012). In addition, IBA data can have both regional and global applications, \n\nsuch as environmental assessment, design of best management practices, or broad-scale \n\nintegrative marine spatial planning. \n\n \n\nAnalytical issues \n\n \nOur approach clearly reflects the utility of a spatial planning tool like Zonation. The selected \n\nworkflow allowed to integrate a considerable amount of information on seabird \n\ndistributions, at broad spatial and temporal scales, to provide a simple, balanced and \n\nobjective identification of the most relevant areas for conservation. The final framework is \n\na well-justified proposal for expansion of the existing SPAs network, as well as a valuable \n\ncontribution for future implementation of MPAs in Portugal. \n\n \n\nThree major aspects stand out from Figure 9. First, the importance of continental shelf \n\nareas, especially along Nazar\u00e9-Minho area and off Cape Raso Coast. Seabirds usually show \n\n\n\n 89 \n\na numerical response in relation to food availability (Schreiber &amp; Burger 2002) . Shelf edge \n\nareas, north of Nazar\u00e9 are highly productive offshore areas, due to upwelling systems and \n\noceanographical fronts that can support large numbers of seabirds. The attraction of \n\nseabirds to these edge areas may also be related with fisheries effort and fishery discards. \n\nTrawlers persistently operate along the shelf, attracting large numbers of offal-eating \n\nseabirds. So, migratory and breeding seabirds in this region, benefit from human fisheries \n\nin the area, by foraging on food items that would otherwise be unavailable to them.  \n\n \n\nSecond, the importance of a group of 3 offshore areas encompassing: the abyssal plain \n\nbetween Porto Seamount and S. Pedro canyon; the area north of Carvalho Ara\u00fajo Trough; \n\nthe area Estremadura Spur and Duarte Pacheco Spur. These 3 areas present high diversity \n\nof geological formations, like canyons, seamounts and abyssal plains. Though, the most \n\nrelevant aspect is that these 3 areas are all associated with smoother slopes zones and \n\nmore moderate continental shelf rise than other continental shelf areas. During Autumn \n\nand Winter, this group of 3 areas is influenced by WIWiFs, Western Iberia Winter Fronts. \n\n \n\nThe third area shown in this Figure is the Gorringe Ridge-Amp\u00e8re Seamount area. This is a \n\nwell known region characterized for its high productivity, due to the influence of the ACEB, \n\nAzores Current Eastern Branch, and biodiversity (ICNF 2015). \n\n \n\nImplications for marine conservation planning in Portuguese cont inental \nwaters \n\n \n\nUnderstanding the patterns of seabird distribution is crucial to the definition of MPAs \n\n(Amorim et al. 2009), but the identification of truly oceanic important areas for seabirds is \n\nstill a challenge (Arcos et al. 2012). Most often the spatial planning for seabird conservation \n\nfocus on protection of breeding areas with much less attention  given to feeding, resting, \n\nmigratory and wintering areas (Amorim et al. 2009). In this work, we followed a workflow \n\nthat allowed to identify relevant areas for conservation of marine bird diversity on \n\nPortuguese offshore waters (Lehtom\u00e4ki et al. 2009; Lehtom\u00e4ki &amp; Moilanen 2013), not \n\nrelevant as breeding areas, but important as feeding, resting, migratory and wintering \n\n\n\n 90 \n\ngrounds for migratory and highly mobile species. The output areas can be considered as an \n\necologically well-justified proposal for future implementation of MPAs and expansion of \n\nthe current marine Natura 2000 network outside the Portuguese territorial waters.  \n\n \n\nOur results address many of the planning needs Portugal has for the marine environment. \n\nRecent SPA designation focused on designation of protected areas on territorial waters \n\nexcluded offshore areas. This work shows that there is a necessity for designating \n\nprotection areas in non-coastal zones, which are also ecologically important for seabirds \n\nduring their annual life cycle. Some of the identified key areas are in regions thought to be \n\nimportant for marine biodiversity, due to their environmental characteristics (e.g. Gorringe \n\nBank). Indeed, the majority of IBAs are associated with physical features that influence \n\nproductivity and/or cause upwelling and mixing (Smith et al. 2014; Lascelles et al. 2016). \n\nOther proposed areas are located on the border of the EEZ and the territorial waters\u2019 limit. \n\nSome of the proposed areas can be consider an extension of current nearshore SPAs. \n\n \n\nThese results are also very relevant to undertake in the future best practice management \n\nactions, aimed at identifying potential conflict areas with anthropogenic activities and \n\nminimize their impacts. In general, fisheries are considered to be the major conflictive \n\nactivity with marine biodiversity conservation (Croxall et al. 2012). But on offshore areas \n\nthere are several other pressures that might affect species ecological niches (Lascelles et \n\nal. 2016). For instance, recent prospection for oil and gas in offshore areas of the \n\nPortuguese EEZ can lead to the development of drilling infrastructures in the near future. \n\nSeabirds are also very sensitive to marine traffic and pollution (Croxall et al. 2012; Winiarski \n\net al. 2014; Lascelles et al. 2016) which is likely to increase. Therefore, there is a crucial \n\nneed to understand the environmental factors driving the distribution of marine birds and \n\nother species in the region and implement a robust SCP approach, based on well set \n\nconservation objectives. Specific conservation actions should also be integrated in a larger \n\nnational management plan in order to consider the flux of individuals and populations \n\nbetween distinct MPAs. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n \nReferences \n\n \nAmorim, P., M.

From this work, it is clear that overall productivity parameters (SST and Chlo-\n\na) are good predictors of species presence (Chapter 2 and 3), most likely due to their link \n\nwith availability of resources, whilst species ecology and seasonality making other variables \n\ncontributing differently for a given species at a given time (e.g. \u201cdistance to colony\u201d in the \n\nbreeding season). Although inter-specific variation is expected and should be considered \n\nwhen designing conservation measurements, intra-specific variation is also quite relevant \n\nparticularly between the sexes, which might have distinct requirements (Chapter 3). \n\nPredictive models are only as good in their ability to produce valuable outcomes as the data \n\nthat is inputted into them. It is therefore paramount to collect good quality empirical data \n\nand to process environmental data with the highest definition possible (also considering \n\nthe tracking resolution) and most importantly to select an adequate modelling approach to \n\nthe datasets (Chapter 4). Final decision making process in which to select which areas \n\nshould be designated for protection status can be supported with prioritization techniques \n\n(Chapter4), and the methods show here can be of great for the conservation of marine \n\nsystems.  \n\n \n\n \n\nMonitoring seabird spatial distribution s \n\n \n\nUnderstanding seabird spatial ecology, habitat preferences and movement patterns in \n\npelagic areas is a task usually hampered by logistic and financial constraints (Ram\u00edrez et al. \n\n2008). The most common study methods are ship-based or aerial censuses or individual \n\n\n\n 100 \n\nremote tracking, using data-loggers. There is a wide array of devices useful for seabird \n\ntracking (e.g. platform terminal transmitters (PTT) or acoustic telemetry tags), that can be \n\ncombined with other technologies (e.g. accelerometers, depthmeters or temperature \n\nsensors) to better understand individual behaviour or measure environmental parameters \n\nof the selected habitats (Wilson et al. 2007; BirdLife International 2009).Positioning \n\ntechnology, precision, total device weight, attachment method, waterproofness, battery \n\ncapacity, availability of solar panel recharge or remote data transmission (and type of \n\ntechnology used to do so) are some of the aspects that have to be taken into account when \n\ndefining study species, experimental design, spatiotemporal resolutions and ecological \n\nquestions to be addressed in seabird tracking studies (Wilson &amp; Vandenabeele 2012; Hunt \n\n&amp; Wilson 2012). \n\nThe results obtained in Chapter 2, based on remote tracking data of individuals of both  \n\nspecies of Giant Petrels, using Geolocators (GLS), highlights the usefulness of this \n\ntechnology for predictive distribution studies, projected to macro (1000-3000Km2) or \n\nmega-scales (>3000 Km2) (BirdLife International 2009) and aimed to cover species annual \n\nlife cycles. The major drawbacks of this technology are its low precision (100-200 km, \n\n(Phillips et al. 2004))  , since it is based on light readings that can be sometimes erroneous \n\ndue to external effects and/or animal behaviour; and the fact that the bird has to be caught \n\na second time for tag removal as this are loggers and require data downloading. Given the \n\nfact that it only allows to calculate two positions per day, and its low energy consumption \n\nrates, GLS are more suited for long term tracking, for instances to study migration ecology \n\nor seasonal differences in habitat use (Chapter 2). \n\nTechnological advances made Global Positioning System (GPS) devices widely available and \n\nmore affordable for wildlife studies. Combined with other technologies like GSM/GPRS and \n\nsupplied with solar charging capacity, it is now possible to use GPS on medium or long-term \n\ntracking studies, benefitting from its high spatiotemporal resolution capabilities and \n\nprecision, and also allowing to remotely retrieve data in an automated process. The \n\nGPS/GSM system used on Chapter 3 of this thesis to track individuals of Audouin\u2019s Gull \n\nduring the breeding season required the adaptation of several commercial technologies to \n\ndevelop an entirely novel solution for long-term seabird tracking. These new transmitters \n\n\n\n 101 \n\nwere successfully used for the first time on a seabird and it enabled the longest tracking of \n\nthis species so far anywhere in the world. This achievement allowed acquiring totally novel \n\ninformation regarding the species distribution during the entire breeding period. The new \n\ntransmitters applied to seabirds (and developed in collaboration with members of \n\nCEABN/CIBIO) open new avenues of research for this group of species given the relatively \n\nlow cost of these tags in relation to similar options currently commercially available.   \n\n \n\nAdvantages of long -term monitoring schemes and multi -taxa approaches \n\nfor Spatial Conservati on Planning (SCP) \n\n \n\nThe integrative approach of incorporating multi-year data of species occurrence, available \n\nfrom long-term monitoring schemes, on predictive modelling and spatial prioritization \n\nprocedures, using a temporal scale that splits the annual cycle in several seasons (Chapter \n\n4), is a solution to incorporate stochastic inter-annual variations between homologous \n\nseasons in the Spatial Conservation Planning process, thus reflecting the dynamic nature \n\nof the marine environment. At the same time, this approach also allows to better \n\nunderstand intra-annual differences in space use by seabirds. \n\n \n\nOptimal design of a protected area intended to conserve a given population would need to \n\nencompass that population\u2019s entire year-round distribution. While it may be possible to \n\naccomplish such a design for some resident or non-migratory species (Reeves 2000), the \n\nranges of most seabird populations are often be too large for this to be practicable. Also, \n\neffectiveness of marine protected areas depends on their ability to protect different life \n\nstages and distributional ranges (nesting, feeding, and migrating grounds), as vulnerability \n\nof a population may be habitat and stage specific (Hooker &amp; Gerber 2004; Yorio 2009). The \n\ninclusion, as much as possible, in the SCP process (Chapter 4) of distribution data for \n\ncommon and occasional, migratory and resident, threatened and least concern species, \n\nalthough with different relative weights in the spatial prioritization analysis performed, \n\nreflects the aim of minimizing the risk of not identifying important areas for seabirds in the \n\nfinal results. \n\n\n\n 102 \n\nThe long-term and multi-taxa approaches allowed to obtain a more comprehensive picture \n\nof ecosystem\u2019s reality in the Chapter 4 results. \n\n \n\n \n\nSpatiotemporal flexib ility of marine protected areas networks  \n\n \n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed and used as a tool for seabird \n\nconservation worldwide (Duffy 1994 Hyrenbach et al. 2000; Yorio 2000, 2009; Wienecke &amp; \n\nRobertson 2002; Airame et al. 2003; Garthe &amp; Skov 2006; Lombard et al. 2007). To date \n\nthere have been relatively few Natura 2000 sites identified for the offshore marine \n\nenvironment and this represents the most significant gap in the Natura 2000 network \n\n(European Commission 2007). Therefore, Chapter 4 of this thesis presents itself as case \n\nstudy in the European context and contribution to address this problem. \n\n \n\nScientific studies and technical guidelines suggest that boundaries of MPAs in open sea \n\nshould be flexible enough to adapt to the range shifts of nutrients (Hooker &amp; Gerber 2004; \n\nEuropean Commission 2007; Claudet 2011; Ruiz-Frau et al. 2015), organisms and water \n\nmasses, especially when MPAs focal species of concern are as highly mobile as seabirds, \n\nwhose spatial distribution is more affected by prey densities and oceanographic variables \n\nthan static physical features, as bathymetry (unlike the cetaceans) (Hooker &amp; Gerber 2004). \n\n \n\nA more adaptable proposal of MPAs boundaries definition accordingly with time of the \n\nyear/phenology, using seasonal outputs from Spatial Conservation Planning processes (as \n\npresented in Figure 9, Chapter 4) could contribute to minimize the problem of MPAs \n\ninefficiency to effectively protect highly mobile seabird species. \n\n \n\nEven if some doubt still subsists on the efficiency of offshore MPAs, at least they may pose \n\na legal and regulatory framework to human activities, fact that is directly relevant for \n\nseabird conservation (Lascelles et al. 2012; Perrow et al. 2015).  \n\n\n\n 103 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAirame, S., J.E.
