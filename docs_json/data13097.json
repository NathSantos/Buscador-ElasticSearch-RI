INTRODUCTION \n\nThe Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith belongs to a group of granitoid rocks occurring in \n\nthe SW border of the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ) and these are confined to a sub-parallel \n\nalignment to the boundary between the CIZ and Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) oriented NW-SE. It \n\nis a pre-orogenic tabular granitic body with subvolcanic textures, which is located south of the \n\nAm\u00eandoa-Carvoeiro sinform D3 (Rom\u00e3o, 2001). Its radiometric age has been intensively \n\ndiscussed since stratigraphic and structural observations seen in the field are not consistant with \n\nthe previous Rb/Sr age determination which was 402\u00b115 Ma (Abranches &amp; Canilho, 1981/82). \n\nWe intend to solve the mentioned contradiction by presenting a new U-Pb zircon (ID-TIMS) \n\nage for the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith followed by a discussion of its implications for \n\nthe lithostratigraphic sequence of Iberian Terrane (Dias et al., 2006). \n \n\n2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\nThe Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith has a half-ring shape with two elongated edges in \n\nthe NW-SE direction: the Penhascoso the SW side (1,5 - 2km wide) and the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o village \n\nsegment in the SE side (1 - 1,5 km wide). \n\nThis laccolith, whose thickness is above 80m, underlies with the synclinal section of the \n\nmetasediments that compose the Palaeozoic sedimentary succession. An intrusion in the \n\nlithologies of the units that belong to Grupo das Beiras (GB) and Grupo de Vale do Grou (GVG) \n\nmailto:gdunning@mun.ca\nmailto:rdias@uevora.pt\n\n\ne - T e r r a         Volume X \u2013 n\u00ba Y |  2010 \nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia \n\n \n\ncan be seen throughout its lower limit. At the top, the granitic laccolith intrudes quartzite and \n\nconglomerate beds of the Quartzite Armorican Formation (QAF) and presents an erosive contact \n\nwith the Brejo Fundeiro Formation (FBF). The granitic laccolith can be seen, at macroscopic or \n\nmesoscopic scale, invading the first beds of the base QAF (sub-horizontal dip and direction is \n\nN20\u00ba-30\u00baW), in the eastern margin of the Coadouro riverside, in Casal da Barba Pouca. Also in \n\nthis region, an approximately circular granitic apophysis, 10-20 cm in diameter, defines a small \n\nintrusion into the first quartzite beds which are positioned immediately above the granite. At the \n\nborder of the granitic apophysis the granularity slightly decreases which is a chilled margin, 1-2 \n\nmm thick forming a halo of iron oxides. \n\nThe actual geometry of the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penascoso granitic laccolith is a result of the phases of the \n\nVariscan orogeny. The D1 Variscan folds affect the Palaeozoic lithostratigraphic units that occur \n\nin this region, including the laccolith, producing a syncline named Domingos da Vila-Casalinho. \n\nThis structure presents a fracture cleavage subparalel to its axial plane with an orientation of \n\nN60\u00ba-70\u00baW that affects the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penascoso granitic laccolith. Also, in Monte de Jo\u00e3o Dias (W \n\nof Ma\u00e7\u00e3o), folds with axes oriented N10\u00baW are associated with the D2 Variscan refolded the \n\nlaccolith. These folds have an axial planar cleavage marked by micaceous minerals and cut by a \n\nN-S dextral shear zone. \n\nDistinct lithofacies have been mapped in the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith: \n\nmicrogranite, rhyolite and eruptive breccias. The main lithofacies is composed of microgranite \n\nthat lies in the central part and in the southern border of the laccolith. The remaining and smaller \n\nlithofacies are positioned along its northern margin. \n\nThe microgranites, which are thin to very thin, are mesocratic and porphyritic rocks, with \n\ninclusions of the presence of dark green phyllitic restites, usually connected to phyllitic minerals. \n\nThey have a holocrystalline texture with rich in K feldspar crystals, macroscopic blue quartz, \n\noligloclase and biotite over 5mm, in an essentially quartzo- feldspathic thin matrix. Other less \n\nimportant minerals include: garnet, zircon, apatite, sphene-leucoxene, chlorite, calcite, sericite, \n\nrutile and opaque minerals. The rhyolites are leucocratic rocks with textures ranging from \n\nholocrystalline to hypocrystalline, with aphanitic matrix micro-cryptocrystalline. They differ \n\nfrom the microgranites essentially due to the fine-grained matrix and the rarity of phenocrysts. \n\nThe eruptives breccias, located in the base of the laccolit h footwall, are composed of a matrix \n\nwith rhyolitic nature in which are cemented and dispersed numerous elements from country \n\nrocks over 40-50 cm. The most common lithological elements are the pelite and the greywacke \n\nfrom GB. Less frequent fragments are granite (Belver) and microgranite, generally poorly \n\ncalibrated and with granolumetric heterogeneity. The xenoliths lack a preferred orientation, but \n\nthey occur with rounded shapes, and frequently flattened. On the other hand, greywacke and \n\npelitic xenoliths, mostly laminated, occasionally present reaction edges where a slight \n\nrecrystallization with a development of mica, quartz and eventually manganese (?) can be \n\nobserved. \n\nThe absence of meaningful thermometamorphic effects in Paleozoic lithologies that outcrop \n\naround the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith suggests that this body is the result of relatively \n\nshallow magmatic intrusions. This intrusion rose and cut the GB and GVG metasediments, \n\nextending laterally along the surface of discontinuity, located between the strata of the GVG and \n\nQAF units, invading the latter slightly. Moreover, when the Variscan deformation is removed the \n\nbody of Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic corresponds to a mushroom-shape, injected between almost \n\nconcordant layers on the laccolith margins. \n\nThe evolutionary model for the emplacement of the granite laccolith is described below. It \n\nbegins with the deposition of the GB turbidite metasediments, which will overlap discordantly \n\ndelta deposits of the GVG and the basal lithologies characteristic of the coastal environment of \n\nthe QAF. Subsequently, there is the intrusion of laccolith, forcing its way between slightly \n\n\n\ne - T e r r a         Volume X \u2013 n\u00ba Y |  2010 \nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia \n\n \n\ninclined strata of the GVG and sub-horizontal layers of FQA. This generates a mushroom-shaped \n\na granitic body with the strata above the intrusion arch and rise, which may eventually emerge. \n\nThis uplift consists of poorly consolidated strata, composed by conglomerates and quartz-\n\nsandstone of the QAF, which are rapidly eroded by marine erosion. This erosion is evidenced by the \n\ndifferences in thickness in the QAF: near the laccolith the thickness is small (0-15 m) and in areas \n\nadjacent to the laccolith it reaches values of about 40-50m. Products resulting from erosion are \n\nresedimented, originating thin arkosic and conglomeratic horizons of low thickness between the \n\neroded top of the QAF and pelitic unit (BFF) resulting from the subsequent resumption of \n\nsedimentation. In places where the QAF has been completely eroded, the BFF was deposited \n\noverlying directly on the granitic laccolith Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso, for example in the Ribeira de \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3o. This event would have occurred after the deposition of QAF and before the sedimentation \n\nof the pelitic BFF and it is conditioned by the structure of the pre-existing rocks. \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nAbranches &amp; Canilho (1981/82) determined the 402\u00b115 Ma absolute age (using Rb/Sr method) \n\nfor the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso granitic laccolith, from 6 whole rock samples. These define an \n\nisochrones with an initial ratio \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.7140\u00b10.0020(25) and MSWD=0.74. However, field \n\ndata do not support this age since the laccolith intrudes during QAF deposition and before BFF \n\ndeposition in Oretanian times. \n\nAs an attempt to resolve this incongruence, a sample of the microgranitic lithofacies collected \n\nfrom the left margin of the river Coadouro (geographical coordinates N39\u00ba 32\u00b4 38\u00b4\u00b4; W29\u00ba 01` \n\n21``), was selected for geochronological studies. The zircons were separated from fresh rock \n\nsamples using standard techniques of heavy minerals separation. The final selection of the zircon \n\ngrains was performed first using binocular microscope and then by cathodoluminescence. \n\nThe result of the U-Pb (ID-TIMS) analysis of prismatic zircon from the microgranite of the \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3o-Penhascoso laccolith, was an age of \u201cca 483 Ma\u201d (base of Tremadoc in accordance with the \n\nnew chronostratigraphic classification of the Ordovician System, Bergstrom et al., 2009). Since \n\nthe laccolith intruded the QAF, this unit would already have some thickness and be compacted, \n\nwhich means that the deposition is prior to \u201cca 483 Ma\u201d (Tremadoc and Upper Cambrian). \n\nIn the base of the first beds of the QAF the ichnofossils species Cruziana cf. om\u00e1nica and \n\nCruziana? barbatarugosa were identified. These Cruzianas have been described from Upper \n\nCambrian (Seilacher, 2007). \n\nAs the QAF is slightly discordant on the GVG transgressive deltaic succession (Rom\u00e3o et al., \n\n2005), it is expected that the deposition of this group has happened in the Upper Cambrian. \n\nThere is a high angle unconformity between the BG metasediments and the GVG and QAF \n\nsuccessions, embodied by a major sedimentary hiatus, erosion and/or deposition over a \n\nconsiderable period of time, a consequence of the \u201cSardic s.l.\u201d phase with minor upper stage \n\ndisconformities (QAF/GVG) and a major lower (GVG/GB). \n\nThe present data should be considered in the context of age correlations, stratigraphical and \n\ngeochronological, of the SW Europe Variscides (Iberia and Armorica). In Spain, the GB \n\nequivalent units have been dated as Lower Cambrian to terminal Ediacaran from in trilobites, \n\nCloudine and icnofossils (Jensen et al., 2007; Cortijo et al., 2010). So, we infer that to consider \n\nthat the \u201cSardic s.l.\u201d phase is intra-Cambrian (base of the Upper Cambrian to Middle Cambrian?) \n\nin the SW border of the CIZ. \n\nZircons from an altered ash-fall tuff bed within the upper Barrios Formation (Ordovician \n\nArmorican Quartzite facies), in the Cantabrian Zone of the Iberian Variscan belt were dated. U-\n\nPb analyses of six highly abraded single grains yielded concordant and overlapping error ellipses \n\nwith a pooled concordia age of 477.47 \u00b1 0.93 Ma (Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2009). The GVG \n\nlithologies can be correlated with the Cap de la Ch\u00e9vre Formation, Crozon Peninsula, and \n\n\u201cInicial Red Beds\u201d, in central Brittany, including the French Armorican Massif. The first unit has \n\n\n\ne - T e r r a         Volume X \u2013 n\u00ba Y |  2010 \nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia \n\n \n\nvolcaniclastic strata, which have been dated to 465\u00b11Ma (Darriwilian) by method U/Pb zircon \n\n(Bonjour et al., 1988), and the second unit contains, interstratified, trachytic and andesitic lavas \n\nhave been dated by 472 \u00b1 5Ma (Floian) by the Rb/Sr whole rock method. These data suggest that \n\nthese units were deposited during the Ordovician. \n\nWe conclude that the Armorican quartzite lithofacies are possibly diachronous. In the Iberian \n\ntraverse the QAF is younger from SW to NE. In the OMZ, the quartzite lithofacies is possibly \n\nUpper Cambrian, below the Floian Barrancos Formation represented by pelites of deeper \n\nlithofacies than the quartzite lithofacies and above an unconformity on Middle Cambrian \n\nsequences (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2006). In the SW segment of CIZ, where the Ma\u00e7\u00e3o studied area is \n\nsituated, the QAF is Upper Cambrian to Tremadoc according to the new isotopic data presented \n\nin this paper. In the NE segment of the CIZ the AQF is considered Floian because of the \n\nconglomeratic and impure quartzite unit (Bojas Formation) below were found inarticulate \n\nbrachiopods whose first record is located in the Tremadoc and occur in large numbers in the \n\nFloian (Coke &amp; Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco, 1995). The AQF lithofacies in the WALZ have been dated in \n\nmost of the Arenig (Vera et al., 2004). \n\nThe diachronic age of QAF is consistent with a foreland to the NE, in the basement of the \n\nCantabrian Zone. This corresponds to a promontory of Gondwana that can feed mature sands to \n\nthe Cambro-Ordovician siliciclastic platform from a passive margin of a large continent such as \n\nGondwana. This paleogeography could be extended to adjacent areas of Armorica fed from \n\nsouthern Gondwana continent before the opening of Paleotethys Ocean. The synchronous \n\ndeposition of shallow water would require a very rapid sedimentation rate which is not \n\ncompatible with a stable and quiet sedimentary environment; alternatively a stable large \n\ncontinent such as Gondwana could feed with mature sands its shallow water passive margin for a \n\nlong period of time. \n\n \n\nRefer\u00eancias \nAbranches, M.C.B. &amp; Canilho, M.
