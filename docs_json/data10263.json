S\u00e3o conhecidas pela capacidade \ndos diferentes taxa responderem a varia\u00e7\u00f5es das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais dos \nrios e por serem frequentemente o \u00fanico elemento de qualidade biol\u00f3gica \nrepresentativo da flora aqu\u00e1tica em pequenos rios e ribeiras. Em consequ\u00eancia \ndestas caracter\u00edsticas, e de acordo com a Directiva Quadro da \u00c1gua, as \ndiatom\u00e1ceas s\u00e3o presentemente um dos elementos biol\u00f3gicos obrigat\u00f3rios na \navalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade ecol\u00f3gica dos rios europeus. No entanto, ainda existe \nalgum desconhecimento acerca dos efeitos das altera\u00e7\u00f5es globais e da escala \nespacial nas diatom\u00e1ceas. Para colmatar esta lacuna, o presente trabalho tem \ncomo objetivo estudar o efeito de altera\u00e7\u00f5es globais relevantes e da escala \nespacial nas comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas de rios temperados assim como \nestudar a melhor forma de lidar com as suas implica\u00e7\u00f5es na biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o. \nO efeito das altera\u00e7\u00f5es globais foi estudado em rios e ribeiras da regi\u00e3o centro \nlitoral de Portugal continental dado tratar-se de uma regi\u00e3o densamente \npovoada e sujeita a impactos antropog\u00e9nicos significativos. O efeito da escala \nespacial nas comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas foi investigado atrav\u00e9s de uma \nexperi\u00eancia laboratorial (mesocosmos) e tamb\u00e9m com recurso a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \nestat\u00edstica de comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas de v\u00e1rias regi\u00f5es temperadas, \nincluindo as costas ocidentais dos Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica e da Austr\u00e1lia. \nDe modo atingir o objetivo principal deste trabalho, tr\u00eas quest\u00f5es globais foram \ncolocadas: (1) Como lidar com as influ\u00eancias antr\u00f3picas hist\u00f3ricas na \nbiomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o?; (2) Ser\u00e1 que as comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas reflectem os \neventos extremos causados pelas altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas? Uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o \ncom as comunidades de macroinvertebrados; (3) Como s\u00e3o as comunidades \nde diatom\u00e1ceas influenciadas pela escala espacial (pequena escala: habitats; \ngrande escala: inter-continental). Verificou-se uma influ\u00eancia antropog\u00e9nica \nconsider\u00e1vel nos rios e ribeiras da regi\u00e3o centro litoral de Portugal continental \nassim como a inexist\u00eancia de verdadeiros locais de refer\u00eancia. Mesmo os \nlocais considerados como estando em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de menor perturba\u00e7\u00e3o \napresentaram concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes consideravelmente elevadas na \n\u00e1gua. Uma vez que as fortes press\u00f5es antropog\u00e9nica (p.e., altera\u00e7\u00e3o da \nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria, condi\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica e carga de sedimentos) n\u00e3o \npermitiram o estabelecimento de condi\u00e7\u00f5es de refer\u00eancia adequadas para os \nrios desta regi\u00e3o, foi proposto um procedimento alternativo baseado numa  \ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o de dois m\u00e9todos \u2013 modela\u00e7\u00e3o e filtros ambientais. A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeste procedimento na defini\u00e7\u00e3o de condi\u00e7\u00f5es de refer\u00eancia revelou-se \u00fatil \npara lidar com os efeitos das altera\u00e7\u00f5es globais na biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o com \nrecurso a comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas e macroinvertebrados. De facto, como \nseria de esperar, as comunidades observadas em rios sujeitos a altera\u00e7\u00f5es \nantropog\u00e9nicas revelaram-se menos homog\u00e9neas do que as previstas em \ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de refer\u00eancia para esses mesmos rios, i.e., atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \ndos referidos filtros ambientais. Em conjunto com o desenvolvimento deste \nnovo procedimento, foi tamb\u00e9m proposto um novo \u00edndice multim\u00e9trico de \ndiatom\u00e1ceas. Este novo \u00edndice revelou-se fortemente correlacionado com as \npress\u00f5es selecionadas, fornecendo uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade biol\u00f3gica mais \nabrangente do que o \u00edndice oficial adotado por Portugal, o Indice de \nPolluosensibilit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique (IPS). Para responder \u00e0 segunda quest\u00e3o global \napenas um subconjunto de ribeiras da regi\u00e3o litoral de Portugal foi \nselecionado, o qual engloba as ribeiras cujos leitos secaram durante uma vaga \nde calor invulgar que ocorreu em Portugal em 2011/2012. Verificou-se que, de \nfacto, quer as comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas quer de macroinvertebrados \nforam afetadas pelo evento de seca extrema tendo-se observado altera\u00e7\u00f5es ao \nn\u00edvel das propor\u00e7\u00f5es de traits, composi\u00e7\u00e3o e a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade \nbiol\u00f3gica. No entanto, as diatom\u00e1ceas apresentaram uma recupera\u00e7\u00e3o \nsignificativamente mais r\u00e1pida que os macroinvertebrados. Os tipos de \nsubstratos usados na experi\u00eancia de mesocosmos realizada neste trabalho \n(duro vs. macio; pequena escala espacial) tamb\u00e9m mostraram afetar as \ncomunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas, uma vez que houve diferen\u00e7as quer na sua \ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o quer nas propor\u00e7\u00f5es de traits. Esta resposta ao tipo de substrato \nfoi mais evidente em condi\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas controladas do que aquela \nsugerida pelas diferen\u00e7as entre as comunidades epips\u00e2micas e epil\u00edticas dos \nrios monitorizados neste trabalho. N\u00e3o obstante, durante a experi\u00eancia de \nmesocosmos verificou-se que ao n\u00edvel de IPS as diferen\u00e7as entre substratos \nn\u00e3o eram relevantes quando comparadas com as que se haviam verificado \nnos rios. As diferen\u00e7as observadas entre as comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas dos \nv\u00e1rios continentes (Europa, Am\u00e9rica e Austr\u00e1lia) sugerem que varia\u00e7\u00f5es ao \nn\u00edvel da grande escala tamb\u00e9m ocasionam diferen\u00e7as nas comunidades, \napesar de influenciados pelo mesmo tipo de clima. Isto sugere que outros \nfactores para al\u00e9m do clima (p.e., geologia, processos biogeogr\u00e1ficos \nhist\u00f3ricos e hidrologia) podem ter contribu\u00eddo para as diferen\u00e7as inter-\ncontinentais verificadas ao n\u00edvel da composi\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades de \ndiatom\u00e1ceas, a todos os n\u00edveis taxon\u00f3micos estudados. De um modo geral, os \nresultados obtidos durante este estudo trazem novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es e novas \nabordagens para lidar com a biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, mais trabalho ser\u00e1 \nnecess\u00e1rio a fim de investigar, por exemplo, os efeitos do aumento da \ntemperatura previstos devido ao aquecimento global na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade \nda \u00e1gua com base em comunidades de diatom\u00e1ceas.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nDiatoms, lowland streams, biological water quality assessment, Least \nDisturbed Condition, reference condition, multimetric diatom index, traits, \nmesocosm experiment, inter-continental variability, substrate, \nmacroinvertebrates. \n\n \n\nabstract \n\n \nDiatoms are generally the most frequent and abundant algae in streams and \nare known by their responsiveness to changes in the environmental conditions \nof streams. Diatoms are frequently the only biological quality element \nrepresentative of the aquatic flora in small streams. As a result, diatoms are \nnowadays a mandatory biological element in the evaluation of the ecological \nquality of European rivers, according to the Water Framework Directive. \nNevertheless, there is still a relative lack of knowledge of key effects of global \nchanges and spatial scale on diatoms. To bridge this gap, this work aims to \nstudy the effect of relevant global changes as well as spatial scale on diatom \ncommunities of temperate rivers and to deal with its implications in \nbioassessment. The relevant global changes were assessed in streams from \nthe central Portuguese littoral region which is highly populated and suffers from \nhigh anthropogenic impacts. The effect of spatial scale on diatom communities \nwas investigated by a laboratorial experiment (mesocosm experiment) and by \nusing diatom data from temperate regions of the United States of America and \nAustralia. In order to achieve the main aim, three global questions were raised: \n(1) How to deal with the historical anthropogenic influences in the \nbioassessment?; (2) Are extreme events due to climatic changes reflected in \ndiatom communities? A comparison with macroinvertebrate communities; (3) \nHow are diatom communities influenced at the spatial scale (small-scale: \nhabitats; large-scale: inter-continental). A strong anthropogenic influence on the \nstreams and rivers of the Portuguese littoral region was confirmed as well as \nthe lack of true reference sites. Sites in the Least Disturbed Condition (LDC) \nhad considerable high nutrient concentrations. As the strong anthropogenic \npressures (e.g., alteration of the riparian vegetation, morphological condition \nand sediment load) prevented an adequate definition of reference conditions for \nstreams in this area an alternative procedure to define suitable reference \nconditions was investigated, consisting of a combination of modelling and filter \napproach. This procedure is suitable to deal with the implications of global \nchanges on diatom and on macroinvertebrate communities. The communities \nobserved in the different streams were less homogeneous than those predicted \nfor the same streams under reference conditions (i.e., through the filter \napproach), as would be expected in sites having variable levels of \nanthropogenic change. Along with the development of this new approach a new \nmultimetric diatom index was developed. This index produced strong \ncorrelations with the selected pressures, providing a more comprehensive \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassessment of biological quality than the Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 \nSp\u00e9cifique (IPS) officially adopted for Portugal. To answer the second \nglobal question a smaller set of streams were used within the \nPortuguese littoral region that were affected by an unusual drought \nevent that lead to the complete drying of the stream channels. Diatoms, \nas well as macroinvertebrates, were affected by the drought event \nconsidering trait proportions, community\u2019s composition and \nbioassessment classifications. However, the diatom communities had a \nfaster recovery response than macroinvertebrates. The type of substrate \n\u2013 hard and soft \u2013representing the small spatial scale affected diatom \ncommunities by changing its composition and trait proportions but not \nwater quality classification in a mesocosm experiment. However, the \ndifferences found in the epipsammic and epilithic diatom communities in \nthe streams that were used to answer the first global question were \nmore evident than those found in the mesocosm experiment. In fact, \nwith the mesocosm results, and under the same physical and chemical \nconditions the IPS differences between substrates disappeared \ncontrasting with the differences that were found in the streams. \nAdditionally, the diatom communities were different between continents \nwith the same type of climate, suggesting that diatom communities are \nalso influenced at the large-scale (even at the order level). Therefore, \nconstraints other than climate are likely to have contributed to the inter-\ncontinental differences in diatom community composition found at all \ntaxonomical levels (e.g., geology, historical biogeographic processes \nand hydrology). On the whole, the results obtained during this study \nbring new information and new approaches to deal with the \nbioassessment. However, some more work must be done in order to \ninvestigate e.g., based in the global warming predictions, the effects of \nthe temperature increase, on the water quality assessment based on \ndiatom communities. \n\n\n\n \n\ni \n\nTable of contents \n\nTable of contents ................................................................................................................................................................................. i \n\nList of Figures ...................................................................................................................................................................................... v \n\nList of Tables ........................................................................................................................................................................................ x \n\nList of Publications ........................................................................................................................................................................ xiii \n\nChapter 1 -

They are very common and abundant in almost all \n\naquatic habitats (freshwater and marine) and also in terrestrial habitats (Mann and Droop, \n\n1996; Stoermer and Smol, 1999). This group of algae is characterized by many features but \n\nespecially by their siliceous cell walls, composed of two valves that together with the girdle \n\nbandas form the frustule (Figure 1.1). Due to the size, shape, and ornamentation of its cell \n\nwalls, diatoms are relatively easily distinguished to species and subspecies levels. Also, due to \n\nits siliceous nature, diatom frustules are preserved in sediments and record habitat history \n\n(Stevenson and Pan, 1999). \n\nDiatoms are the most species-rich components of river and stream ecosystems. They \n\nplay an important role in food webs (e.g., they are the food for many macroinvertebrates and \n\nfish), in the oxygenation of surface waters, and constitute a linkage between biogeochemical \n\ncycles (e.g., nutrient uptake and remineralization) (Mulholland, 1996; Stevenson and Pan, \n\n1999). In rivers and streams diatoms are present either in the water column \n\n(potamoplanktonic diatom communities) or in the benthos (growing attached to surfaces-\n\nrocks, aquatic plants, sand grains or living free in the sediment) (Round et al., 1990). \n\nHowever, diatom communities found in small streams are mostly benthic (Patrick, 1977).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Photograph from the sample collected in Vala da Corujeira (Casal dos Netos). Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m \n\n(for both figures). \n\nThe structure and function of diatom communities are regulated by many abiotic and \n\nbiotic factors, at different spatial scales (from single sand grains to across continents) (Biggs, \n\n1996). Climate, geology, biogeography and land use are ultimate factors, at large spatial scale, \n\nthat affect the resources (e.g., light, nutrients and space), biotic factors (e.g., competitors and \n\nherbivores) and abiotic stressors (e.g., pH, temperature and toxic substances) that directly \n\naffect the function and structure of benthic algal communities (Stevenson, 1997) (Figure 1.2). \n\nEnvironmental factors, expressed at multiple scales, determine the composition and structure \n\nof local biological communities as these variables can be seen as \u2018filters\u2019 through which \n\nspecies in the regional species pool must \u2018pass\u2019 to potentially be present at a given site \n\n(Keddy, 1992; Poff, 1997; Quist et al., 2005). The suite of taxa existing at a site under \n\nreference conditions is visualised as resulting from a natural, top-down filtering process \n\napplied to a regional pool of taxa, whereby only those taxa with appropriate traits are able to \n\npass the natural filters (Chessman and Royal, 2004). Thus, if diatoms were well dispersed in \n\nsites with similar environmental conditions we would find the same species in all sites \n\n(Virtanen and Soininen, 2012) as the reference condition is, accordingly with Reynoldson et \n\nal. (1997), \u2018the condition that is representative of a group of minimally disturbed sites \n\norganized by selected physical, chemical, and biological characteristics\u2019.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n3 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Hierarchical interrelationships among proximate (resources and abiotic stresses), \n\nintermediate, and ultimate (climate, geology, land use) determinants of benthic algal assemblage \n\ncomposition and biomass. Source: Stevenson (1997). \n\nDiatoms, like other organisms, have been considered to be ubiquitous. In contrast to \n\nlarger organisms (e.g., macroinvertebrates Heino and Soininen, 2007), diatoms may be easily \n\ndistributed via wind, currents and animal vectors (e.g., Kristiansen, 1996), which result in \n\nwider distributions in comparison to metazoans (e.g., Finlay et al., 2002; Heino and Soininen, \n\n2007).  \n\nSome large-scale studies (Potapova and Charles, 2002; Soininen, 2004; Soininen et al., \n\n2004) have demonstrated that factors related to spatial variables may also influence diatom \n\ndistribution patterns (Virtanen and Soininen, 2012) even at the genus level (Vyverman et al., \n\n2007). The increasing incidence of apparent regional endemisms (e.g., in the diatom floras of \n\nAustralia) and the increasing evidences pointing to a strong regionalization of diatom floras \n\nin the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, mirroring the biogeographical regions that have \n\nbeen recognized for macroorganisms, are in favour of the prevalence of restricted \n\ndistribution patterns among diatom species (Vyverman et al., 2007; Vyverman et al., 2010). \n\nFactors related to historical processes (i.e., colonization and extinction, dispersion and \n\nmigration) constrain global patterns in regional and local diatom composition and diversity \n\n(Vyverman et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n4 \n\n1.2 Global changes and implication on river ecosystems \n\nFreshwater is a fundamental resource for both nature and humans (Naiman and \n\nDudgeon, 2011). However, freshwater ecosystems are among the most altered systems on \n\nEarth (Naiman and Dudgeon, 2011). Due to the high number of species per area found in \n\nthese ecosystems the decline in its biodiversity is far greater than in terrestrial or marine \n\necosystems (Sabater et al., 2013). Within these ecosystems running waters are unique in \n\ntheir unidirectional flow (Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002). Such characteristic shapes the \n\nmorphology of river channels, makes running waters inherently variable in space and time \n\nand has led to a biota that is highly adapted to dynamic conditions (Malmqvist and Rundle, \n\n2002). \n\nThe unidirectional nature of rivers and streams makes these systems unique, however \n\nalso aggravates its vulnerability. Almost any activity within a river catchment has the \n\npotential to cause environmental change and any pollutant entering a river is likely to exert \n\neffects for a large distance downstream (Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002). Running waters \n\nprovide a multitude of benefits for humans, such as sources of water, means of power \n\ngeneration and waste disposal, routes for navigation and places for leisure activities \n\n(Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002). Due to this, river banks have been inhabited for millennia and \n\nuntil nowadays are densely populated. With such intense human pressure on rivers and \n\nincreasing demand for water over the past century (Gleick, 2000), it is not surprising that \n\nnowadays few streams or rivers remain unaltered (Frissell and Bayles, 1996; Malmqvist and \n\nRundle, 2002; Wiens, 2002; Naiman and Dudgeon, 2011). In fact, some of these ecosystems \n\nhave been so starkly and extensively modified that their return to a natural state is almost \n\nimpossible (Frissell and Bayles, 1996). The main factors causing such modifications in \n\nrunning waters are ecosystem destruction (e.g., urban and agricultural expansion), physical \n\nhabitat (e.g., hydrology, channel morphology) and water chemistry alteration (e.g., industrial \n\nemissions) and direct species additions or removals (e.g., aquaculture/aquariums) \n\n(Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002). An indirect factor that is presently, and will in the future be \n\nexpected to cause more modifications in the rivers is the increase in the use of coal, oil and \n\ngas worldwide. This induces higher greenhouse gases emissions (carbon dioxide- CO2, \n\nmethane- CH4 and nitrous oxide- N2O) that are resulting in a global transformation of the \n\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere and climate without precedents (Sabater et al., 2013; IPCC, 2014).  \n\nDue to climate changes many freshwater species have shifted their geographic ranges, \n\nseasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions as in many \n\nregions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, \n\naffecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality (IPCC, 2014). At high rates of \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n5 \n\nwarming, major groups of terrestrial and freshwater species are unable to move fast enough \n\nto stay within the spatially shifting climate envelopes to which they are adapted (IPCC, 2014).  \n\nDespite all the climate changes that have already been verified, forecasts predict a \n\ndoubling in atmospheric CO2 concentration by the end of this century and a rise in world \n\nmean air temperature between 1.8 and 4.0 \u00b0C (IPCC, 2007). In central Europe, heat waves are \n\npredicted to be more frequent, more intense and longer in duration. Heavy winter \n\nprecipitation is also predicted to increase in central and northern Europe, and decrease in the \n\nsouth (IPCC, 2007; IPCC, 2013). The southern part of Europe will also suffer a predicted \n\ndecrease in summer precipitation (Beniston et al., 2007). These changes in precipitation, \n\ntemperature and consequently evapotranspiration rates will affect volumes of surface water \n\nrunoff. Model simulations predict a 10-30% decrease in annual runoff in southern Africa, \n\nsouthern Europe and in the western United States by the mid-century (Milly et al., 2005; \n\nIPCC, 2007). In contrast, other models predict a decrease in annual runoff in southern Europe \n\nthat may reach as much as 50% of the current levels (Arnell, 1999). Typically temperate and \n\nrainy climate areas (e.g., central Europe) will become more similar to Mediterranean climate \n\nareas that are characterised by mild wet winters and hot dry summers (Giorgi and Lionello, \n\n2008), thus suggesting its expansion to northern regions. These changes in the world climate \n\nwill be exacerbated by other pressures that are presently affecting the streams and rivers \n\n(e.g., increase in the length of time that threshold concentrations of nutrients are exceeded) \n\n(Ockenden et al., 2016). \n\nEurope's running waters are no exception and are affected by a range of pressures, \n\nincluding water pollution, water scarcity, floods, and modifications to water bodies that affect \n\nmorphology and water flow (EEA, 2015). In order to try to reverse this situation, in 2000 the \n\nEuropean Community published the Water Framework Directive (WFD: European \n\nCommission, 2000, Directive 2000/60/EC). This directive aims to incorporate into a legally \n\nbinding instrument the key principles of integrated river basin management bringing \n\ntogether economic and ecological perspectives (COM (2012) 670 final).  \n\nIn the WFD, water management accounts for the water needs of both humans and nature \n\n(European Commission, 2000). The WFD established that all European Union Member States \n\n(MS) shall protect, enhance and restore the aquatic environment through the implementation \n\nof programmes of measures developed and implemented as part of river basin management \n\nplans in order to maintain or achieve good water status by 2015 (European Commission, \n\n2000). This status would allow aquatic ecosystems to recover and to deliver the ecosystem \n\nservices that are necessary to support life and economic activity that depend on water (COM \n\n(2012) 670 final).The good water status goal is achieved when both good chemical and \n\necological status of water bodies is attained (European Commission, 2000; Guidance \n\nDocument No. 10, 2003). However, 2015 reports state that the MS still have a long way to go \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n6 \n\nbefore the quality of all European Union waters is good enough, due to decades of previous \n\ndegradation and persisting ineffective management and that the WFD objective will only \n\nlikely be met by 53% of surface water bodies (Figure 1.3) (EEA, 2015). This constitutes a \n\nmodest improvement, as in 2009 43% of surface water bodies were in good or high ecological \n\nstatus, and is far from meeting policy objectives. Rivers and transitional waters are on \n\naverage in a worse condition than lakes and coastal waters. \n\n \nFigure 1.3 - Percentage of good ecological status or potential of classified rivers and lakes in Water \n\nFramework Directive river basin districts. Source: EEA (2015). \n\n1.3 Implications of global changes on diatom communities \n\nEnvironmental factors determine the composition and structure of local biological \n\ndiatom communities. Therefore, any anthropogenic changes to these environmental factors \n\n(e.g., pH, salinity, nutrients, suspended sediments, flow) may affect the diatom communities \n\nas aquatic organisms are known to integrate all the biotic and abiotic changes that occurred \n\nin their habitat (Lowe and Pan, 1996).  \n\nPan et al. (1999) showed that diatom communities are strongly controlled by \n\ngeomorphic and disturbance factors (e.g., land cover/use in watersheds and riparian \n\ncondition). The degradation of riparian vegetation can lead, for example, to change in water \n\ntemperature patterns. The streams are more exposed to sunlight and, therefore, more \n\ninfluenced by atmospheric temperature (Poole and Berman, 2001). Among the sources that \n\ncontribute to sedimentation and turbidity in streams are agriculture, forestry, mining, road \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n7 \n\nconstruction, and urban activities (Henley et al., 2000). Land use in the catchment can also \n\ninfluence the water quality as it may cause changes in nutrient load. However, this influence \n\ndepends on intrinsic factors of the catchment, such as the transport capacity of the \n\nwatershed, the influence of riparian buffers, climatic and geomorphological basin features, \n\nand the existence of additional pressures (Pardo et al., 2012). The loss of riparian vegetation \n\nalso facilitates the runoff of sediments into the streams, as these areas are important \n\nsediment sinks (Daniels and Gilliam, 1996; Sheridan et al., 1999). Increase in the sediment \n\nload and consequent increase in turbidity of streams can cause a reduction in algae growth \n\ndue to the decrease of light availability for photosynthesis (Henley et al., 2000). In addition, \n\nsediment deposition can also promote smothering and stability of substrata to which diatoms \n\nattach. Hence, non-motile and particularly chain-forming diatoms cannot establish easily, \n\nfurther pushing the assemblage towards single celled and motile taxa (Jones et al., 2014).  \n\nNutrient enrichment of freshwaters is widespread. The main sources of nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus include point source emissions from urban wastewater treatment plants and \n\nindustry, and diffuse emissions from agricultural production (EEA, 2015). The projected \n\nclimate changes have also been associated with likely increases in sediment and nutrient \n\nloads. For example, the expected increase in winter rainfall due to climate changes is likely to \n\nenhance the annual loads of total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus load from land to \n\nwater (Ockenden et al., 2016).  \n\nThe alterations in nutrient concentrations can potentially cause changes in the diatom \n\ncommunities as different diatoms have different ranges and tolerances. The nutrient \n\nenrichment can benefit certain taxa, while others become rarer (Lange et al., 2011). Tolerant \n\nspecies can become dominant in the communities (e.g., Cocconeis placentula, Encyonema \n\nminuta and Fragilaria vaucheria) whereas Achnanthidium minutissimum and Rossithidium \n\npetersenii show the opposite pattern (Lange et al., 2011).  \n\nCurrent velocity variations over both space and time is typical of all streams and \n\nperiphytic algae are exposed to these variations. Therefore, current affects directly (e.g., \n\ndislodging of species loosely attached to substrata) and indirectly (e.g., affecting the \n\ndistribution of macroinvertebrate grazers) benthic algal metabolism and distribution \n\n(Stevenson, 1996). Diatoms are known to be relatively susceptible to disturbance by current \n\n(Stevenson, 1996; Ghosh and Gaur, 1998). Floods and droughts are also important hydrologic \n\nevents in running water ecosystems. Therefore, in-stream biological communities have \n\ndeveloped adaptations that range from the avoidance of individual floods or droughts to life-\n\nhistory strategies that are synchronised with long-term flow patterns (Lytle and Poff, 2004). \n\nThe traits developed by species enable them to survive, exploit and even depend on \n\ndisturbance as a result of a long evolutionary period (Lytle and Poff, 2004). Thus, the native \n\ncommunities of drought-prone systems are the result of a multi-habitat filter process that \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n8 \n\nselects organisms with a set of traits that enable them to either survive to droughts \n\n(resistance traits) or to re-colonise and recruit after the drought breaks (resilience traits) \n\n(Poff, 1997; Bond et al. 2008). However, the communities of rivers exposed to rapid changes \n\nin natural flow conditions (i.e., magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and predictability) are \n\ndeprived of such an evolutionary period. Changes in the natural flow of typically permanent \n\nstreams due to extreme events or climate change may therefore exert stronger effects on the \n\necological structure and functioning of stream communities (Lake, 2000). \n\n1.4 Dealing with global changes and spatial scale in bioassessment \n\nDiatoms are valuable indicators of environmental conditions in rivers and streams, \n\nbecause they respond directly and sensitively to many physical, chemical, and biological \n\nchanges in river and stream ecosystems, namely nutrient concentrations (Stevenson and Pan, \n\n1999). In fact, diatom community characteristics (composition and abundance) have been \n\nused to assess the ecological integrity of rivers and streams due to three basic reasons: their \n\nimportance in ecosystems, their utility as indicators of environmental conditions, and their \n\nease of use (Stevenson and Pan, 1999). The frequent use of diatoms as biological indicators \n\nhas led to the development of several systems in order to interpret the data (Kelly et al., \n\n1995). Diatom autecological indices were developed to infer levels of pollution (mostly \n\nnutrients) based on the species\u2019 composition of communities and their ecological preferences \n\nand tolerances (IPS-Cemagref, 1982; CEE-Descy and Coste, 1990; EPI-D \u2013 Dell\u2019Uomo, 2004; \n\nIBD \u2013 Prygiel and Coste, 1998, among others). However, several studies have demonstrated \n\nthat diatoms also respond to important hydromorphological, chemical (besides nutrients), \n\nand physical changes in the environment (e.g., Potapova and Charles, 2003; Almeida and Feio, \n\n2012; Feio et al., 2014). \n\nIn result of this sensitivity to environmental conditions, diatoms are nowadays a \n\nmandatory biological element in the evaluation of ecological quality of European rivers, \n\naccording to the WFD (European Commission, 2000; Leira and Sabater, 2005). In association \n\nwith other Biological Quality Elements - BQE (other aquatic flora, benthic invertebrate fauna \n\nand fish fauna), and the hydromorphological, chemical and physical elements that support \n\nthem (European Commission, 2000; Ferreira et al., 2011) they provide a holistic picture of \n\nthe ecological status of the aquatic environment (Leira and Sabater, 2005; SWD (2012) 379 \n\nfinal). The ecological status of each water body is determined by the quality element having \n\nthe lowest status class, according to the one-out-all-out principle. This principle is at the \n\nheart of integrated river basin management that addresses all pressures and impacts on \n\naquatic environment. It ensures that the negative impact of the most dominant pressure on \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n9 \n\nthe most sensitive quality element is not averaged out and obscured by minor impacts of less \n\nsevere pressures or by less sensitive quality elements responding to the same pressure. \n\nFrom all types of substrates found in rivers, most studies with diatoms focus on \n\nepilithon (Winter and Duthie, 2000), as hard surfaces are the preferred substrates used in \n\nwater quality assessment (Kelly et al., 1998). However, other substrates like submerged \n\nmacrophytes and sediments are also commonly found may be dominant in some stream and \n\nriver sections (Kelly et al., 1998; Elias et al., 2015). Some studies indicate that benthic diatom \n\nspecies present different biological characteristics that enable them to adapt to specific \n\nmicro-habitats (Krejci and Lowe, 1986; Soininen and Eloranta, 2004). If these natural inter-\n\nsubstrate differences are reflected in water quality assessment metrics, this can potentially \n\nmask responses of algal communities to stresses associated with human activities and may \n\ninterfere with water quality assessments based on the knowledge of these responses (Winter \n\nand Duthie, 2000; Potapova and Charles, 2005; Bere and Tundisi, 2011; Mendes et al., 2012). \n\nSome studies have tested the effect of different substrates in water quality assessments and \n\nhave not verified significant differences (Kitner and Poul\u00edckov\u00e1, 2003; Potapova and Charles, \n\n2005; Mendes et al., 2012). However, these studies were conducted under natural conditions \n\nwhere the communities are shaped simultaneously by many environmental factors, which \n\nmay lead to confounding effects (Stevenson and Pan, 1999). In addition the substrate effect is \n\ndifficult to detect in large-scale, coarse resolution studies, when the role of other factors, such \n\nas inter-stream differences in hydrology, physical habitat, and chemistry become more \n\nimportant than the role of substrate (Potapova and Charles, 2005). Even when different \n\ndiatom communities of the same river are compared and differences are verified (Cetin, \n\n2008) it is difficult to ensure that the communities have been exposed to the same \n\nenvironmental variations at the same time or even at the same developmental phase. \n\nAdditionally, it is impossible to avoid contamination between substrates with diatoms \n\nmigrating between habitats in wadeable streams. \n\nThe definition of type specific reference conditions is an important step in the process of \n\nassessing the ecological quality status of rivers. The ecological quality status is obtained by \n\nquantifying the deviation in composition and abundance of BQEs in a water body from the \n\ncomposition and abundance expected under reference conditions for that type of water body \n\n(e.g., mountain or lowland type) (Schaumburg et al., 2004). However, a representative suite of \n\nappropriate reference conditions has to be identified for each type of water body \n\n(Schaumburg et al., 2004; Pardo et al., 2012) to permit an interpretation of measured values \n\n(e.g., biological indices) that takes account of natural spatial differences in the composition \n\nand abundance of BQEs (Hawkins et al., 2010). Under the WFD, the reference point is \n\n\u2018undisturbed\u2019 conditions with no or only \u2018very minor\u2019 human impacts on hydromorphological, \n\nphysical and chemical elements (Guidance Document No. 10, 2003).

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n10 \n\nwater bodies with only minor impacts are absent from many parts of Europe (and other \n\nregions of the world) because of historical anthropogenic alteration of landscapes and high \n\npopulation densities (Nijboer et al., 2004; Kelly et al., 2012; Feio et al., 2014). An example of \n\nan area where \u2018undisturbed\u2019 conditions is almost impossible to find is the central-western \n\nPortuguese littoral region. During the WFD implementation all this area was included in a \n\nsingle type, the Littoral (L type), since only a few reference sites were used. That probably \n\nresulted in the inclusion of a wide variety of streams in the same typology. Recognizing this \n\nlimitation, the WFD allows the type-specific biological reference conditions to be either \n\nspatially based (via reference sites), based on modelling (predictive models or hindcasting \n\nmethods), or derived from a combination of these methods and even based in \n\npaleolimnological data (European Commission, 2000). Where it is not possible to use these \n\nmethods, Member States may use expert judgement to establish such conditions (European \n\nCommission, 2000).  \n\nAs in many situations it is difficult to dissociate the obvious effect of climate change, \n\nincrease in temperature, from other anthropogenic or natural effects. Therefore, as the \n\ndiatom communities are known to respond well to several environmental factors is very \n\nlikely that the effects of climate change will be reflected in the presently used autecological \n\nindices. The prevention of higher negative impacts on diatom communities due to climate \n\nchanges probably passes through the reduction of non-climatic stressors, such as habitat \n\nmodification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, to increase the inherent \n\ncapacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate (IPCC, 2014). \n\nAdaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based \n\napproaches and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological \n\nchanges due to climate change and their impacts (limited evidence, high agreement). \n\nStrategies include adopting integrated water management, augmenting supply, reducing the \n\nmismatch between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening \n\ninstitutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies and water-saving \n\nstrategies (IPCC, 2014). Results suggest that, for example, in order to build resilience in \n\nstream health and help mitigate potential increases in diffuse agricultural water pollution due \n\nto climate change, land management practices should target controllable risk factors, such as \n\nsoil nutrient status, soil condition and crop cover (Ockenden et al., 2016). Actions may also \n\ninclude maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, \n\nmanipulation of disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, floods) (IPCC, 2014). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n11 \n\n1.5 Aims of the present work \n\nIn view of the current knowledge on diatoms communities and their use as indicators of \n\nrivers ecological quality, the present thesis aimed to answer to the following global questions:  \n\n\u2022 How to deal with the historical anthropogenic influences in bioassessment? \n\nIn order to achieve this goal, the central-western Portuguese littoral region, a highly \n\nimpacted area subjected to different stressors (e.g., agriculture and urbanization), was \n\ndefined as case study. The following chapters resulted from this global question: \n\nChapter 2 - Determining useful benchmarks for the bioassessment of highly disturbed \n\nareas based on diatoms \n\nChapter 3 - Predicting reference conditions for river bioassessment by incorporating \n\nboosted trees in the environmental filters method \n\n\u2022 Are extreme events due to climatic changes \u2013 reflected in diatom communities? A \n\ncomparison with macroinvertebrate communities.  \n\nIn order to answer this question, four streams located in the central-western Portuguese \n\nlittoral region, affected by a severe and uncharacteristic drought event from the end of \n\nsummer 2011 to the winter of 2012, were defined as case study. The drought effects in the \n\ndiatom and macroinvertebrate communities from temperate streams were also compared \n\nwith those from Mediterranean systems to assess possible shifts in the communities. Two \n\nchapters resulted from this second global question: \n\nChapter 4 - From perennial to temporary streams: an extreme drought as a driving force \n\nof freshwater communities\u00b4 traits \n\nChapter 5 - Extreme drought effect and recovery patterns in benthic communities of \n\ntemperate streams \n\n\u2022 How are diatom communities influenced at the spatial scale (small-scale: habitats; \n\nlarge-scale: inter-continental). \n\nIn order to answer this question, an indoor controlled experiment was performed and \n\ndiatom data from streams and rivers from three continents with similar climate were defined \n\nas case study. Two chapters resulted from this third global question: \n\nChapter 6 - Influence of the colonizing substrate on diatom assemblages and \n\nimplications for bioassessment - a mesocosm experiment \n\nChapter 7 - Do similar climatic patterns in different continents lead to similar benthic \n\ndiatom assemblages? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Such benchmarks are established at \n\nthe level of ecoregions, typologies, or site. Yet, in highly disturbed regions, such as coastal \n\nareas of European countries, the assessment of streams\u2019 water quality based on the reference \n\ncondition concept is very difficult, due to the lack of undisturbed sites. Among others, the \n\nreduced number of reference sites may have as a consequence the definition of imprecise \n\necological benchmarks. Here we tested the hypotheses that (1) the increase in the number of \n\npotential reference sites (2) the definition of more precise abiotic thresholds using the least \n\ndisturbed condition approach (LDC), and (3) the use of diatom assemblages, as the most \n\nubiquitous element in lowland areas, would result in refinement and eventual sub-division of \n\nexisting river types of a highly disturbed area, such as the Portuguese centre-western region. \n\nFor this purpose, abiotic data characterising natural conditions of 55 sites from a littoral \n\nhighly disturbed region were used in a hierarchical classification analysis that revealed the \n\nexistence of three different sub-groups. In addition, a three-step approach was used to define \n\nthresholds for the pressure variables in LDC. Based on these new thresholds, sites in LDC \n\nwere selected. A hierarchical classification performed to the LDC diatom spring assemblages \n\nrevealed the existence of two sub-groups, concordant with two of the abiotic sub-groups. \n\nSeveral species contributed to the dissimilarity between the two sub-groups (e.g., \n\nAchnanthidium minutissimum and Karayevia oblongella). Differences between the sub-groups \n\nwere also found in the trait proportions of stalked species. New benchmark values for these \n\ntwo sub-groups, based on the scores of the official diatom index, the \u2018Indice de \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n22 \n\nPolluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019 (IPS), were different from the previous reference value used. Yet, \n\nno biological benchmark values were established for one of the groups due to the absence of \n\nsites in the LDC.  \n\nOur study suggests that streambed substrate is an important characterisation variable in \n\nthe river type definition and highlights that, in spite of the potential refinement in reference \n\nconditions and typology obtained, an alternative approach that does not require the use of \n\nreference sites should be explored in the future.  \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nLeast Disturbed Condition, lowland streams, natural variability, substrate, type-specific \n\nreference conditions \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n23 \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nModern ecological assessments of streams and rivers are frequently based on the a \n\npriori definition of ecological benchmarks, given by reference-quality sites, to which assessed \n\nsites are matched in terms of assemblage composition and structure (Hawkins et al., 2010). \n\nSuch ecological benchmarks have been established at the level of ecoregions, typologies or \n\nsite-specific (Hawkins et al., 2010). \n\nIn Europe, and according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD; European \n\nCommission, 2000), type-specific reference conditions must be defined (Schaumburg et al., \n\n2004; Pardo et al., 2012) for each water body and biological quality element (BQE; \n\nphytoplankton, macrophytes and phytobenthos, benthic invertebrate fauna, and fish fauna). \n\nThe classification in types is an attempt to organise the abiotic variability of streams (or \n\nwater bodies) in order to determine areas that are homogeneous regarding a certain number \n\nof features, such as climate, altitude, geology, or morphology, that strongly influence the \n\ndistribution and community composition of aquatic biota (Wimmer et al., 2000). However, \n\nwhile the suitability of such an approach was often investigated and well accepted for \n\nmacroinvertebrates (e.g., Rawer-Jost et al., 2004; Verdonschot and Nijboer, 2004; \n\nVerdonschot, 2006; but see Lorenz et al., 2004), the same is not always true for other \n\nbiological elements. \n\nAmong the BQEs that are primary producers, phytobenthos is frequently the only \n\navailable community in small streams, due to the absence of true phytoplankton and \n\nmacrophyte vegetation (Eloranta and Soininen, 2002). Diatoms have been selected by most \n\ncountries in Europe as representative of such a group (Almeida and Feio, 2012; Kelly et al., \n\n2012; Feio et al., 2014). Several studies have demonstrated that diatoms respond to \n\nimportant hydromorphological, chemical, and physical changes in the environment (e.g., \n\nPotapova and Charles, 2003; Almeida and Feio, 2012; Feio et al., 2014). Yet, diatoms are also \n\nknown to react differently than other aquatic elements to streams\u2019 abiotic features. For \n\nexample, in a study conducted by Feio et al. (2007), the macroinvertebrates revealed to be \n\nhighly associated with the substrate type, diversity of habitats, and water velocity, while \n\ndiatoms revealed to be highly associated with geology and stream size. That is one of the \n\nmain problems of the WFD typological approach, as it assumes a community concordance \n\nbetween the BQEs (the use of the same river types to define ecological benchmarks for all \n\nBQEs), which is difficult precisely because the various elements respond differently to \n\nvarious water body and catchment features (Paavola et al., 2003; Dolph et al., 2011). \n\nIn addition, the establishment of true reference conditions may be a problem in Europe, \n\nand also in many other regions of the world, due to a long history of anthropogenic alteration \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n24 \n\nof landscapes and high population densities (Nijboer et al., 2004; Kelly et al., 2012; Feio et al., \n\n2014). Therefore, alternatives to the use of pristine sites to establish benchmarks for the \n\necological assessment have been discussed and proposed by several authors in recent years \n\n(Reynoldson et al., 1997; Stoddard et al., 2006; Hawkins et al., 2010; Birk et al., 2012; Pardo \n\net al., 2012).  \n\nAmong those, the concept of least disturbed condition (LDC), according to Stoddard et al. \n\n(2006), seems potentially useful to define ecological benchmarks for the central-western \n\nPortuguese littoral region. As in other lowland/coastal regions, this area has been suffering \n\nfrom intensive land use, urbanisation, industry, and agriculture, and historical data aren\u2019t \n\navailable. To establish the LDC for these regions, a careful definition of what are presently the \n\n\u2018best\u2019 conditions, based on a set of explicit criteria, is needed (Stoddard et al., 2006). The \n\n\u2018best\u2019 (best available) for the present region are sites with anthropogenic disturbances \n\nconcerning changes in hydromorphological characteristics such has riparian vegetation, \n\nhydrological regime, channelisation, sediment load, and nutrient concentrations. However, \n\napplying this concept in highly disturbed regions may result in a reduced number of sites, and \n\nconsequently in the need to enlarge the target area to include more reference sites. This was \n\nwhat we believe occurred during the implementation of the WFD in Portugal. By then, 15 \n\nriver types (INAG, 2008) were established by the Portuguese water authority (Portuguese \n\nWater Institute, now Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente); however, the entire central-western \n\nPortuguese littoral region was included in a single type, the Littoral (L type), since only a few \n\nreference sites were used. That probably resulted in the inclusion of a wide variety of streams \n\n(see section 2.2.1) in the L type, with different communities and potentially different \n\nreference values for water quality assessment. If reference values are inappropriate, an \n\nincorrect quality rating of sites is likely with the attribution of too high or too low quality \n\nclasses.  \n\nHere we discuss and test strategies to overcome the problem of inadequate reference \n\nconditions in such highly disturbed regions. Our main hypotheses were, first, that the \n\nincrease of the sampling sites density, then the refinement of benchmark criteria (to LDC), \n\nand the use of diatom assemblages (as the most ubiquitous biological element in this region) \n\ncould lead to (1) the alteration of the presently accepted reference values for water quality \n\nassessment for the L type based on diatoms, and (2) the redefinition of the L type, with its \n\npossible division. In order to avoid forcing the biological to the abiotic data or vice-versa, we \n\nanalysed independently the existence of abiotic (abiotic data only) and biological (diatom \n\nassemblages) sub-groups and assessed a posteriori the congruence of the sub-groups formed. \n\nFor this purpose, we used data collected at 55 sites from this region to (1) test the coherence \n\nof the L type concerning its abiotic characteristics \u2013 i.e., test the existence of sub-groups; (2) \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n25 \n\nestablish and apply criteria for the selection of sites on the LDC; (3) verify if the least \n\ndisturbed diatom assemblages validate the abiotic sub-groups formed in (1), using both \n\ntaxonomic composition and diatom traits \u2013 i.e., if the abiotic grouping of sites (typology) \n\nmatches the biological grouping; (4) if the sub-groups could be used to define more adequate \n\nbenchmarks for the biological assessment of streams based on diatoms \u2013 namely, using the \n\nPortuguese mandatory diatom index for the region in study, the \u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 \n\nSp\u00e9cifique\u2019 (IPS); and (5) recommend, if needed, new types for this region based on abiotic \n\nand biological information.  \n\n2.2 Methods \n\n2.2.1 Study area and sampling sites \n\nThe central-western Portuguese littoral region has an Atlantic-temperate climate \n\ncharacterised by mild temperatures, moderate summers and winters, and precipitation \n\nvalues above 2,800 mm\u00b7year-1 (Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2007).  \n\nIt comprises the catchments of rivers Vouga (V), Mondego (M), Lis (L), and Tagus (T), \n\nand the Ribeiras do Oeste (O) and Ribeira do Noroeste (NO). The Ribeiras do Oeste and \n\nRibeiras do Noroeste are small streams discharging directly into the sea, located in the south-\n\nwestern part of the study area (Figure 2.1). In general, the L type refers to coastal lowland \n\nrivers (mean 40 m a.s.l.) with a wide range of drainage areas (from 10 to 5386 km2), \n\nincluding small tributaries and coastal streams but also lowland sections of the main rivers \n\nMondego and Vouga (INAG, 2008). In the Portuguese context, these streams are located in an \n\narea with a high mean annual temperature (15 \u00b0C) and intermediate mean annual \n\nprecipitation (900 mm) (INAG, 2008). The lithology has mixed characteristics but includes \n\nlarge limestone areas. \n\nThe study sites cover most of the existing natural variability in the littoral region and \n\nalso include other water bodies that were originally not included in the L type (e.g., streams \n\nfrom Tagus catchment) but have apparently similar environmental characteristics, regarding \n\ngeology, sediment type, channel morphology, and climate, among others (as described above) \n\n(Figure 2.1). We used data from 31 sites sampled between 2004 and 2006 in spring for the \n\nimplementation of the WFD in Portugal by the national water agency (INAG, IP). In addition, \n\nwe collected 132 new samples from 36 sites in 2011 and 2012, covering spring, autumn and \n\nwinter. Thus, a total of 163 samples from 55 different sites were used (as some of the sites \n\nwere common in 2004/2006 and 2011/2012). At all sites, diatom assemblages and \n\nenvironmental data were collected following the same procedures (see section 2.2.2).  \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

The rivers and streams represented (grey lines) are those presently included in the L type. \n\n2.2.2 Sampling collection and processing \n\nSampling and treatment of the diatom assemblages were performed according to the \n\nEuropean standards (European Committee for Standardisation 2003, 2004, 2006). The \n\nsampled substrate was preferably hard substrate (stone or rock); otherwise sediment (sand) \n\nwas sampled. The sediment was used according to the study by Mendes et al. (2012), who \n\nvalidated the use of alternative substrates for water quality assessment with diatoms. For the \n\nepilithic biofilm sampling, an area of ?100 cm2 (five stones) was scraped with a toothbrush \n\nfrom the upper surface of submerged stones. In epipsammon sampling, a volume of about 50 \n\nmL of streambed sediment was collected using a syringe. Samples were preserved with \n\nformaldehyde (4%). In order to ensure ecological reliability of the samples, the proportion of \n\nliving and dead cells was assessed under a light microscope. The samples were then oxidised \n\nwith concentrated nitric acid and potassium dichromate for about 24 hours. Thereafter, \n\npermanent slides were mounted using Naphrax\u00ae, and a minimum of 400 diatom valves for \n\neach sample were counted and identified to the lowest taxonomic category possible. The \n\nidentification was normally done to species or infra-specific rank using a light microscope \n\n(100x objective and 1.32 numerical aperture) and Krammer and Lange-Bertalot\u2019s floras \n\n(1986, 1988, 1991a, 1991b) and Krammer\u2019s (2000, 2001, 2009) floras.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n27 \n\n2.2.3 Abiotic characterisation of the sites \n\nIn situ measurements of pH, conductivity (?S\u00b7cm-1), and percentage of dissolved oxygen \n\n(DO; %) were made using a field meter (Multiparameter Probe 3430 WTW). Water samples \n\nwere collected for posterior laboratory determination of nutrients and chemical oxygen \n\ndemand. Stream data on hydromorphological characteristics (e.g., substrate) and a set of \n\npressure categorical variables adapted from Pont et al. (2006) were assessed at each site \n\n(Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). Other data (latitude, altitude, runoff, mean annual temperature and \n\nprecipitation, drainage area, slope, lithology, % artificial areas, % intensive and extensive \n\nagriculture) were obtained from cartographic sources (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2) (1:25,000 \n\ndigital military maps, Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico do Ex\u00e9rcito, Portugal; Atlas do Ambiente Digital: \n\nAg\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente 2007; Corine Land Cover, 1990). \n\nThe abiotic variables were divided into characterisation and pressure variables. The first \n\nhave very little or minimal influence of anthropogenic activities, such as altitude, lithology or \n\nprecipitation and were used to analyse the streams\u2019 typology (Table 2.1). The pressure \n\nvariables (Table 2.2) are those highly influenced by human activities, such as nutrients (e.g., \n\nnitrates, phosphates, sulphates), dissolved oxygen, or hydrological regime and were used to \n\ndetermine the LDC. \n\nTable 2.1 - Abiotic characterisation variables measured or calculated for each site, units, and \n\ntransformation applied for the PCA. \n\nAbiotic characterisation variables \n\nLatitude (log (x+1)) \n\nAltitude (m; square root)a \n\nRunoff, mean annual (mm; square root)a  \n\nTemperature, mean annual air temperature (\u00b0C; log (x+1))a \n\nPrecipitation, mean annual (mm; log (x+1))a \n\nDrainage area (km2; log (x+1))a  \n\nSlope of the drainage area (%; square root)a \n\nLithology (categorical; square root)a \n\nDominant substrate (in ? 500 m from the site %):b \n\nBedrock (BE; arcsin) \n\nBoulder (BO; arcsin) \n\nCobble (CO; arcsin) \n\nGravel/Pebble (GP; arcsin) \n\nSand (SA; arcsin) \n\nSilt (SI; arcsin) \na Based on Atlas do Ambiente (Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2007); b Based on Environment Agency (2003). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n28 \n\n2.2.4 Data analyses \n\n2.2.4.1 Typology \n\nTo verify the coherence of the Portuguese L type in terms of abiotic characteristics, a \n\nhierarchical classification (Euclidean distance; Unweighted Pair Group Method with \n\nArithmetic mean \u2013 UPGMA) was performed using data from the abiotic characterisation \n\nvariables of all sites. A principal components analysis (PCA) was also performed to determine \n\nwhich of the abiotic characterisation variables best characterised the different groups \n\n(translated in the position of sites along the PCA axes). These were performed based on \n\nabiotic characterisation data of the 55 sampling sites (Table 2.1). The variables with non-\n\nnormal distribution were transformed to achieve normality and comparable measurement \n\nscales (normalising variables) (Table 2.1). This normalisation consists in subtracting to each \n\nentry the mean for the variable and then dividing by the standard deviation (Primer 6 &amp; \n\nPERMANOVA+; PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK; Clarke and Gorley, 2006; Anderson et al., \n\n2008). Mean values and standard deviations were calculated for the variables explaining \n\nmost of the variability in PC1 and PC2. \n\n2.2.4.2 Establishment of the LDC \n\nFor the establishment of the LDC we applied a three-step approach based on Feio et al. \n\n(2014) to the pool of 163 samples.  \n\nStep 1. Samples with class 1 and 2 (minimal and small disturbance), according to Pont et \n\nal. (2006), in all abiotic categorical pressure variables (for more detail see Table 2.2) were \n\nkept and the remaining were eliminated. The selection based only on class 1 in all the \n\ncategorical variables was not considered due to the absence of samples in such conditions.  \n\nStep 2. Based on Step 1 selection, the distribution of numerical variables was \n\ncharacterised using boxplots. The minimum and maximum thresholds for the LDC, \n\nhereinafter called least disturbed abiotic condition (LDAC), were established based on all the \n\nsamples from Step 1, after excluding outliers and extremes. We considered as outliers and \n\nextremes the values > 75th percentile + k (75th percentile \u2013 25th percentile) or &lt;25th \n\npercentile \u2013 k (75th percentile \u2013 25th percentile), being k=1.5 to outliers and k=3 for extremes. \n\nThese thresholds characterise the LDC for littoral streams and can be used as thresholds \n\nto select least disturbed sites.  \n\nStep 3. All samples were screened against the thresholds defined in Step 2, and those \n\nthat were within the limits were considered as representatives of the LDAC for Littoral type. \n\nAll samples of the same site should pass this step, otherwise they were all eliminated. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n29 \n\n2.2.4.3 Least Disturbed Biological Condition (LDBC) based on diatom assemblages \n\nThe spring samples obtained from Step 3 were used to analyse the biological consistency \n\nof the L type and the possible existence of sub-groups regarding diatom assemblages. For this \n\npurpose, a hierarchical classification (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure, flexible UPGMA; \n\nsquare root transformation, relative abundance ? 1%) was performed (PRIMER 6 &amp; \n\nPERMANOVA+). Additionally, a SIMPER analysis was performed to see which taxa \n\ncontributed the most to the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (up to 80% cumulative contribution) \n\nbetween the resulting groups. As some of the sites had more than one spring sample, the \n\nnumber of valves in those samples was previously averaged. \n\nBenthic diatoms use different strategies to resist the environmental pressures. For \n\ninstance, variations in life forms are strongly influenced by current velocity (Rimet and \n\nBouchez, 2012). The use of this trait can provide new insights on the characterisation of river \n\ntypes. Thus, in addition to the taxonomic composition, we used a functional indicator of \n\ndiatom assemblages, the trait life-form, and respective categories: mobile, adnate, \n\npedunculate (pad and stalked), non-colonial, and colonial, according to Rimet and Bouchez \n\n(2012). Therefore, each species was assigned to all the trait categories that it could display, \n\naccording to the bibliography. For each sample, the relative abundance of all the species \n\npresenting a given trait category was calculated. To obtain the trait abundance of each trait \n\ncategory in each sub-group, the average of all the samples from the same group was also \n\ncalculated. Significant differences between the trait categories of the groups were checked \n\nwith an ANOSIM (Analysis of similarity, PRIMER 6 &amp; PERMANOVA+). \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n32 \n\n2.2.4.4 Establishing new benchmarks for ecological assessment \n\nDiatom taxa abundance was used to calculate the IPS of the least disturbed spring \n\nsamples with the OMINIDIA software (Lecointe et al., 1993). As there were some sites with \n\nmore than one sample, the respective IPS values were averaged for the remaining data \n\nanalysis. For each sub-group (obtained from the diatom assemblages of the LDC sites), the \n\nmedian IPS reference value was calculated. Only spring samples were used because only this \n\nseason is used in the Portuguese official monitoring programme; consequently, only spring \n\nreference values are available. To obtain the ecological quality ratios (EQRs) for each site, the \n\nobserved IPS value was divided by the reference IPS value (i.e., the median of each sub-\n\ngroup). The EQR gives the deviation of the observed biological parameter in a given water \n\nbody (type) to the values of that parameter in reference conditions applicable to that water \n\nbody. The EQRs were calculated for reference and disturbed sites (all spring samples) and \n\ncompared with the values obtained from the use of the original median (17.4, as used \n\npresently in official monitoring programme) (INAG, 2009). The attribution of a sub-group to \n\nthe disturbed sites was done according to the groups established in the abiotic hierarchical \n\nclassification. \n\n2.3 Results \n\n2.3.1 Typology \n\nCluster analysis (Figure 2.2) showed that, based on abiotic data, the L type could be sub-\n\ndivided into three sub-groups. A small group of sites (Group I) clearly segregated from the \n\nremaining, and two other bigger groups (Group II and III). Only one site (V80) was not \n\nincluded in any group because it was very different from the remaining (outlier) (Figure 2.2).  \n\nThe two streams from the Tagus catchment (T90 and T91) that presently are not \n\nincluded in the L type, as we expected, were similar to other streams that are considered L \n\ntype (Figure 2.2).  \n\nThe first two axes explained 48.2% of sites\u2019 abiotic variability (PC1=30.1%, PC2=18.1%). \n\nThe variables with the highest contribution to PC1 were runoff, precipitation, slope, and \n\nchannel substrate (sand and cobble) (eigenvectors between 0.314 and 0.424), while drainage \n\narea (eigenvectors = 0.483) and lithology (eigenvectors = 0.380) contributed more to PC2 \n\n(Figure 2.3). The substrate sand contributed almost equally to PC1 and PC2 (eigenvectors of \n\n0.314 and 0.344, respectively). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n33 \n\n \nFigure 2.2 - Hierarchical classification of the sites based on the abiotic characterisation variables. \nThree groups were formed. \n\nThe PCA confirmed the segregation of the abiotic groups. Group I (Figure 2.3) was \n\nclearly segregated from the remaining over PC2. This group includes only sites from the \n\nMondego River with a large drainage area (ca. 5000 km2) (Table 2.3). The other two groups \n\nappeared segregated towards the negative or the positive sides of the PC1 axis (Figure 2.3). \n\nThe streams of these two groups differed in slope, altitude, mean annual runoff and \n\nprecipitation values, and stream substrate (namely, cobble and sand) (Figure 2.3). In Group \n\nII, we found streams in a higher altitude with higher average values of precipitation and \n\nrunoff than in Group III (Table 2.3) and streambed mainly of cobbles and gravel/pebble, \n\nwhile in Group III the streams have predominantly sandy bottoms (Table 2.3). Over the \n\nsecond axis there was also a segregation of the samples by catchment (i.e., latitudinal \n\ngradient). In the positive side of this axis, we found samples from Ribeiras do Oeste and Lis \n\ncatchment (the most southern sites); in the negative side, we found samples from Mondego \n\nand Vouga catchments (the most northern sites) (Figure 2.3). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

The pressure categorical variables that contributed more to sample elimination \n\nwere: riparian vegetation (58.9%), morphological condition (37.4%), and sediment load \n\n(33.1%). Contrarily, toxic acidification (3.1%) and hydrological regime (12.3%) were the \n\ncategories with less contribution for sample elimination. \n\nIn Step 2, the distribution of values for the numerical variables of the samples selected in \n\nStep 1 revealed several outliers and extremes, especially for ammonium, nitrates, phosphates, \n\nand sulphates (e.g., Figure 2.4). This means that these were sites in good hydromorphological \n\ncondition but with an excess of nutrients. The samples corresponding to such values were \n\nalso eliminated, except if they were outliers or extremes for just one of the pressure variables. \n\nThe LDAC of littoral streams is thus represented by the thresholds determined with the \n\nremaining samples and presented in Table 2.4.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n35 \n\nTable 2.3 - Mean (SD, standard deviation) of the abiotic characterisation variables for each abiotic group. \n\n Group I Group II Group III \n\nLatitude 40.1742 to 40.2204 38.7048 to 40.6355 39.1350 to 40.7537 \n\n Mean Mean Mean \n\nAltitude (a.s.l; m) 9.52\u00b110.46 84.89\u00b156.93 31.19\u00b121.09 \n\nRunoff, mean annual (mm) 466.72\u00b170.12 537.71\u00b1210.31 324.05\u00b1101.19 \n\nTemperature, mean annual \nair temperature (\u00b0C) \n\n15.00\u00b10.00 15.50\u00b10.97 15.33\u00b10.48 \n\nPrecipitation, mean annual \n(mm) \n\n1160.00\u00b189.44 1256.00\u00b1267.83 983.33\u00b1130.77 \n\nDrainage area (km2) 4995.20\u00b1543.74 97.13\u00b1183.43 70.09\u00b160.60 \n\nSlope of the drainage area \n(%) \n\n15.26\u00b10.50 12.38\u00b14.75 6.08\u00b13.30 \n\nLithologya 17-100.00%  1-8.00%, 3-24.00%, 5-8.00%, 6-\n28.00%, 7-4.00%, 11-28.00% \n\n1-50.00%, 3-8.33%, 5-16.67%, 6-\n16.67%, 7-4.17%, 11-4.17% \n\nDominant substrate (in ? 500 m from the site %): \n\nBedrock (BE) 0.00 2.34\u00b17.01 0.00 \n\nBoulder (BO) 0.00 7.47\u00b117.06 0.00 \n\nCobble (CO) 0.00 25.81\u00b128.57 0.00 \n\nGravel/Pebble (GP) 16.00\u00b135.78 51.88\u00b130.20 3.48\u00b18.47 \n\nSand (SA) 84.00\u00b135.78 11.13\u00b115.86 81.04\u00b133.33 \n\nSilt (SI) 0.00 0.57\u00b12.86 2.56\u00b17.12 \na 1-Sands, sand dunes, gravels, rolled stones, little consolidated sandstones, clays; 3-Limestones, dolomitic limestones, marly limestones, marls; 5-Conglomerates, sandstones, limestones, dolomitic \nlimestones, marly limestones, marls, carbonaceous schist\u2019s, schist\u2019s; 6-Sandstones, more or less marly limestones, sands, gravels, clays conglomerates, limestones, dolomitic limestones, marls; 7-Red \nstoneware, conglomerates, marls, limestones generally dolomitic; 11-Schists and related rocks; 17-Granites and related rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

All samples from Group \n\nI, the large river, failed Step 1 due to hydrological (connectivity, hydrological regime) or \n\nmorphological alterations, which are caused by the presence of large dams upstream and \n\nchannelisation of some parts of the river. \n\n2.3.3 LDBC based on diatom assemblages \n\nThe cluster analysis of the spring diatom least disturbed assemblages (Figure 2.5) \n\nidentified two distinct groups (Group A and B). Among the species that most contributed to \n\nthe 81.2% average dissimilarity between the two groups (SIMPER) were Achnanthidium \n\nminutissimum (K\u00fctzing) Czarnecki, Karayevia oblongella (\u00d8strup) Aboal, Hippodonta \n\npseudacceptata (H. Kobayasi) Lange-Bertalot, Metzeltin &amp; A. Witkowski, and Nitzschia \n\ndissipata var. media (Hantzsch) Grunow (Table 2.5).  \n\nThere was a total agreement between the two groups formed by the diatom assemblages \n\nof the LDC sites (Figure 2.5) and two of the abiotic groups (Figure 2.2). The LDC sites of \n\nGroup A were all inserted in the abiotic Group II (cluster), while the LDC sites in the Group B \n\nwere all inserted in the abiotic Group III (cluster). Group A includes small stony streams with \n\nhigher precipitation, slope, and runoff. The lithology of the area is quite varied, and includes \n\nsix different categories (category 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 11, see Table 2.3 for category definition). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n37 \n\nSpecies such as A. minutissimum, Eolimna minima (Grunow) Lange-Bertalot &amp; W.

Reichardt &amp; Lange-Bertalot were more abundant in this \n\ngroup. In Group B we found sandy streams, low precipitation and runoff values, and lithology \n\ncategories mainly siliceous (Table 2.3). Group B was characterised by higher abundances of \n\nspecies such as K. oblongella, H. pseudacceptata, N. dissipata var. media, Nitzschia palea \n\n(K\u00fctzing) W. Smith, and Hippodonta capitata (Ehrenberg) Lange-Bertalot, Metzeltin &amp; \n\nWitkowski (Table 2.5). In general, both groups were composed mostly by neutrophil to \n\nalkaliphilic species.  \n\nThe biotic groups also presented differences regarding the trait life-form. Group A \n\npresented higher average abundances of mobile (92.7%) and stalked (64.4%) species. In \n\nGroup B the trait categories with higher average abundances were mobile (80.2%) and pad \n\n(26.4%). Both groups presented high values of non-colonial species (90.7% Group A and \n\n78.5% Group B). The two groups only presented statistically significant differences in the \n\ntrait category stalked, with higher average abundance in Group A than in Group B (Global \n\nR=0.76, P<0.02). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Spring samples. \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\nIn this study, we confirmed the environmental variability of streams present in the \n\nlittoral Portuguese coastal region in terms of environmental characteristics. In a small \n\ngeographic area, we were able to differentiate three sub-groups of streams with differences \n\nin mean annual precipitation, mean annual runoff, slope, altitude, size of the drainage area, \n\nlithology, and stream substrate. Since these variables are used in the definition of the WFD \n\ntypology (European Commission, 2000), those groups could be considered different types. \n\nOne of the groups formed is composed exclusively of sites from Mondego River. The \n\nenvironmental variables that contributed more to the segregation of this group (lithology and \n\nsize of the drainage area) are geochemical and hydrological factors known to influence the \n\ndiatom assemblages (Potapova and Charles, 2002; Lorenz et al., 2004; Feio et al., 2009; \n\nAlmeida and Feio, 2012). Therefore, despite the lack of LDAC and consequently LDBC sites for \n\nthis group, we predict that the diatom assemblages would also be different from the \n\nremaining groups. We also verified that streams which presently are not classified as L type \n\n(e.g., streams from the Tagus catchment) should be included in this type, as they weren\u2019t \n\nsegregated from the remaining in terms of environmental characteristics.  \n\nStudies such as that by Pan et al. (1999) showed that diatom assemblages are strongly \n\ncontrolled by geomorphic and disturbance factors (e.g., land cover/use in watersheds and \n\nriparian condition). Here, the main alterations in the littoral streams were related to the \n\nriparian vegetation, morphological condition, and sediment load, which was expected, as the \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n42 \n\nmain pressures in the region are agriculture and deforestation. The degradation of riparian \n\nvegetation in the majority of the L type streams can lead, for example, to change in water \n\ntemperature patterns. The streams are more exposed to sunlight and, therefore, more \n\ninfluenced by atmospheric temperature (Poole and Berman, 2001). In Feio et al. (2014), \n\ndegradation of the riparian vegetation was also among the main disturbances found in \n\nMediterranean streams. The sediment load is a measure of deviation from the natural \n\ncondition either in the water column or in the streambed. Among the sources that contribute \n\nto stream sedimentation and turbidity are agriculture, forestry, mining, road construction, \n\nand urban activities (Henley et al., 2000). The loss of riparian vegetation also facilitates the \n\nrunoff of sediments into the streams, as these areas are important sediment sinks (Daniels \n\nand Gilliam, 1996; Sheridan et al., 1999). Increase in the sediment load and consequent \n\nincrease in turbidity of streams can cause a reduction in algae growth due to the decrease of \n\nlight availability for photosynthesis (Henley et al., 2000).  \n\nLand use in the catchment can greatly influence the quality of the streams as it may \n\ncause changes in nutrient load. However, this influence depends on intrinsic factors of the \n\ncatchment, such as the transport capacity of the watershed, the influence of riparian buffers, \n\nclimatic and geomorphological basin features, and the existence of additional pressures \n\n(Pardo et al., 2012). The littoral Portuguese region is densely populated but nonetheless, it \n\nwas possible to establish a threshold of 8% of the catchment covered by artificial areas for \n\nthe LDC. However, this value is still high in comparison with other thresholds established in \n\nother studies (e.g.,&lt;0.4% reference and >0.8% rejection threshold in Pardo et al., 2012). \n\nAgriculture (intensive and extensive) is quite relevant in the region, which is reflected in the \n\nthresholds of 17% (extensive) and 51% (intensive). The threshold found in Feio et al. (2014) \n\nfor the intensive agriculture in Mediterranean countries was only of 11%, but in Pardo et al. \n\n(2012) the rejection threshold (for a reference site) for northern Europe was very close to \n\nours (i.e., 50%). Also, Allan (2004) stated that streams remain in good condition in \n\nagricultural catchments as long as the extent of agriculture (including intensive and \n\nextensive) doesn\u2019t exceed 30% \u2013 50%. Our values of total agriculture (intensive plus \n\nextensive) for the least disturbed sites are close to this limit, as they ranged from 5.8 to \n\n53.5%.  \n\nUnder pristine conditions, streams should have low concentration of nutrients (namely, \n\nphosphorous-P, nitrogen-N, and sulphur-S). Therefore, the values obtained here for littoral \n\nLDC were high. Several studies have proposed lower maximum values for these compounds \n\n(see Feio et al., 2014). The high values of N (0.40 mg\u00b7L-1) and P (1.18 mg\u00b7L-1) that we found in \n\nthe streams were probably related with the high percentages of agriculture (such as rice \n\nfields in Mondego or large orchards in the Ribeiras do Oeste) found in the catchments, since \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n43 \n\nthis is one of the major contributors of non-point source pollution (Bernot et al., 2006). In \n\nspite of these broad thresholds, by the end of the three-step approach used for LDC selection, \n\nthe approach was in fact very strict, as only 14.7% of the samples were accepted. This high \n\nelimination rate of samples revealed that this region is under high anthropogenic pressure \n\nand that the approach we used for determining the LDC, through the increase in the sampling \n\nsite density and the refinement of the benchmark criteria, may not be sufficient to define the \n\nreference condition. Other methods have been proposed to infer the LDC such as the use of a \n\nstressor gradient approach, which uses the relationship between the stressor gradient and \n\nbiological indicators to predict LDC for the biological indicators (Angradi et al., 2009) or the \n\nquite similar alternative benchmarking (Birk et al., 2012) based on the notion of aquatic \n\ncommunities with similar low levels of impairment. Yet, none of these approaches assure that \n\nthe existent communities are not already significantly altered, especially when the best sites \n\nare already far from the pristine conditions. \n\nThe large river sites included in our study were all eliminated after failing Step 1, due to \n\nhydromorphological modifications, specifically in the hydrological regime, connectivity, \n\nand/or morphological alterations. These are two common problems of large rivers (Seegert, \n\n2000; Nilsson et al., 2005), which often require the establishment of alternative benchmarks \n\n(Birk et al., 2012), or ultimately their inclusion in the category of highly modified water \n\nbodies when their recovery to the Good status is not possible (European Commission, 2000). \n\nHowever, concerning the large river in this study (Mondego River), care must be taken as the \n\nnumber of samples was very small and the screening abiotic metrics may have been \n\nunsuitable for large rivers (Angradi et al., 2009). Criteria based on screening abiotic metrics, \n\nsuch has riparian vegetation and sediment load, are likely to be less reliable for screening \n\nlarge rivers compared to smaller rivers (Angradi et al., 2009). \n\nWe found two distinct diatom assemblages (two sub-groups) for the least disturbed \n\nsites. These two groups were in accordance with two of the abiotic groups formed. The \n\nabiotic characterisation variables relevant for the difference between Groups II and III were \n\nmean annual runoff, slope, mean annual precipitation, substrate (stone vs. sand), and \n\nlithology. These variables are recognised to be important for determining diatom species \n\ncomposition, and therefore the biological groups were in total agreement with the natural \n\ndivision of the assemblages (Groups A and B) (Potapova, 1996; Potapova and Charles 2002; \n\nAlmeida and Feio, 2012). Most of these variables reflected a longitudinal distribution of the \n\nstreams: sites in Group A were found in more inland streams while the ones from Group B \n\nwere found in more lowland streams close to the coast. Thus, despite the different \n\napproaches (abiotic and biotic), we verified a complete agreement between these two \n\nclassifications. This agreement was also verified in some studies, even with other BQEs \n\n(Lorenz et al., 2004; Rawer-Jost et al., 2004; Verdonschot and Nijboer, 2004; Sandin and \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n44 \n\nVerdonschot, 2006) but not always (Sanchez-Montoya et al., 2007; Feio et al., 2014). In the \n\nstudy conducted by Feio et al. (2014), for example, the streams of one of the abiotic groups \n\nformed (temporary streams) were spread into at least three biological groups for all elements \n\nstudied (diatoms, macrophytes, and macroinvertebrates). However, this lack of agreement \n\nwas probably due to the broad scale of the variables for the definition of the types. In \n\nSanchez-Montoya et al. (2007), the largest difference found between the abiotic classification \n\nand the macroinvertebrates communities was also in the ecotype comprising the temporary \n\nstreams, which was probably due to the large variability in salinity and hydrology found in \n\nthose streams.  \n\nGiven the abiotic differences of the two groups of streams in terms of slope, runoff, and \n\nsubstrate, we expected differences in diatoms\u2019 trait life form. In Group A the species should \n\nhave the capacity to attach to the substrate in order to resist the higher current velocities \n\nassociated with higher slopes and runoff values; in Group B the species should be able to \n\novercome the abrasion of moving grains that can detach larger taxa (Townsend and Gell, \n\n2005) or be able to move (Soininen and Eloranta, 2004) in order to avoid the entrapment by \n\nthe sand grains. Indeed, Group A had higher abundance of stalked species than Group B. This \n\ndifference confirms that the species from Group A are exposed to higher velocities, and that \n\nthe streambed substrate is more stable than the streambed substrate found in streams of \n\nGroup B. However, contrary to what we were expecting, the abundance of mobile species was \n\nsimilar in both groups, revealing the importance of this trait category in both groups of \n\nstreams. \n\nAs the sites used to calculate the median IPS in Groups A and B were under similar \n\nanthropogenic disturbances (LDC), it was to be expected that they presented similar IPS \n\nvalues. However, Group A presented a higher median IPS value than Group B. In particular, \n\nthe high abundance of a sensitive species, Achnanthidium minutissimum, in Group A may be \n\nthe cause of such differences. In some of the samples from Group A, A. minutissimum reached \n\nan abundance of approximately 70%. However, in Group B this particular species only \n\nreached a maximum abundance of 7.3%. As the number of counted valves was similar in all \n\nthe samples, the diatom assemblages from Group B were generally more diverse and showed \n\nhigher evenness. The sensitive and less sensitive species contributed equally to the IPS \n\ncalculation in Group B, while in Group A the IPS calculation was highly influenced by A. \n\nminutissimum abundances. Therefore, the use of a single IPS benchmark value for both \n\ngroups (Group A and B) to calculate EQR values would lead to erroneous classifications, \n\nparticularly in the case of Group B. The division by a higher median than by the appropriate \n\none (as done presently) results in lower ratios, and therefore potential erroneous attribution \n\nof lower quality to sites of good quality. These Type II errors (false negatives) can have \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n45 \n\nimportant consequences, as they imply a higher investment than the one needed for streams\u2019 \n\nrestoration (Johnson et al., 2006). The two groups are indeed abiotically different, suggesting \n\nthe existence of sub-groups within the L type; however, due to the small number of LDC sites, \n\nparticularly for Group B, we must be cautious in our interpretations. \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\nThe contribution of the stream substrate for the definition of the groups suggests that \n\nthis variable should have been included in the typological variables during the WFD \n\nimplementation to allow the construction of relevant types for diatoms. In fact, Lorenz et al. \n\n(2004) included the predominant type of substrate in the determination of stream typologies \n\nin Germany. This study also revealed that there is a wider abiotic variability and \n\ncorresponding differences in diatom assemblages within the L type, as it was defined. \n\nHowever, we would still need a higher number of sites in LDC to achieve an adequate \n\nredefinition of reference conditions for all potential sub-groups, which is not feasible, as we \n\nalready performed an intensive search. We must also take into consideration that type \n\nredefinition must consider other BQEs. Therefore, even if the LDC approach can help improve \n\nthe present bioassessment methods, other alternatives that do not require the use of \n\nreference sites, such as modelling the reference conditions, are still needed, as the present \n\nLDC is far from the desired reference condition (Stoddard et al., 2006; Angradi et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nBQE Biological Quality Elements \n\nEQR Ecological Quality Ratios \n\nIPS Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique \n\nLDAC Least Disturbed Abiotic Condition \n\nLDBC Least Disturbed Biotic Condition \n\nLDC Least Disturbed Condition \n\nPCA Principal Components Analysis \n\nWFD Water Framework Directive \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis study was possible due to the financial support of the Foundation for Science and \n\nTechnology (Portugal) through the projects AQUAWEB (PTDC/AAC-AMB/105297/2008), \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

However, minimally \n\ndisturbed reference sites are lacking in many European regions and other parts of the world \n\nbecause of pervasive anthropogenic influences. Here we describe the use of environmental \n\nfilters modelling, incorporating boosted trees (BT), to derive reference data for abiotic \n\nvariables and biological communities (diatoms and macroinvertebrates) for rivers in a highly \n\ndisturbed region (Portuguese central-western lowland area), where minimally disturbed \n\nreference sites are non-existent. We also revise quality class boundaries for diatom and \n\nmacroinvertebrate bioassessment in this region, and develop a new multimetric diatoms \n\nindex (MDI). The new index includes not only the \u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019 (IPS) \n\nbased on species\u2019 sensitivity to organic pollution and nutrients, but also the numbers of total \n\nand sensitive taxa. Our approach predicted significantly different communities under \n\nreference conditions from those observed, with a higher median reference number of taxa per \n\nsite than the observed number (69 against 27 for diatoms; 53 against 22 for \n\nmacroinvertebrates). In addition, the predicted communities for both biological groups were \n\nmore similar among sites than the observed communities.

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n54 \n\nand quality class boundaries to incorporate the new reference data resulted in more stringent \n\nsite assessments that were better correlated with human pressures than assessments with \n\nprevious methods. This study brings new insight to solve the problem of an absence of \n\nminimally disturbed reference sites. \n\nKeywords \n\nFreshwater, macroinvertebrates, diatoms, reference condition, multimetric diatom index \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n55 \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nRunning waters provide a multitude of benefits for humans, such as sources of water, \n\nmeans of power generation and waste disposal, routes for navigation and places for leisure \n\nactivities (Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002). With intense human pressure on rivers and \n\nincreasing demand for water over the past century (Gleick, 2000), it is not surprising that \n\nnowadays few streams or rivers remain unaltered (Frissel and Bayles, 1996; Malmqvist and \n\nRundle, 2002; Wiens, 2002; Naiman and Dudgeon, 2011). In fact, some of these ecosystems \n\nhave been so starkly and extensively modified that their return to a natural state is almost \n\nimpossible (Frissel and Bayles, 1996).  \n\nIn the European Union (EU), with the implementation of the Water Framework Directive \n\n(WFD: European Commission, 2000), water management accounts for the water needs of \n\nboth humans and nature. The WFD main goals are to achieve good chemical and ecological \n\nstatus of water bodies and prevent deterioration (Guidance Document No. 10, 2003). In order \n\nto pursue these goals, ecological status is assessed by quantifying the deviation in \n\ncomposition and abundance of Biological Quality Elements (BQEs) in a water body from the \n\ncomposition and abundance expected under reference conditions for that type of water body \n\n(e.g., mountain or lowland type) (Schaumburg et al., 2004). A representative suite of \n\nappropriate reference conditions has to be identified for each type of water body \n\n(Schaumburg et al., 2004; Pardo et al., 2012) to permit an interpretation of measured values \n\n(e.g., biological indices) that takes account of natural spatial differences in the composition \n\nand abundance of BQEs (Hawkins et al., 2010). \n\nUnder the WFD, the reference point is \u2018undisturbed\u2019 conditions with no or only \u2018very \n\nminor\u2019 human impacts on hydromorphological, physical and chemical elements (Guidance \n\nDocument No. 10, 2003). However, reference water bodies with only minor impacts are \n\nabsent from many parts of Europe (and other regions of the world) because of historical \n\nanthropogenic alteration of landscapes and high population densities (Nijboer et al., 2004; \n\nKelly et al., 2012; Feio et al., 2014a). Recognizing this limitation, the WFD allows the \n\nreference condition to be either spatially based (via reference sites), based on modelling \n\n(predictive models or hindcasting methods), or derived from a combination of these methods \n\nand even based in paleolimnological data (European Commission, 2000). \n\nSeveral alternative ways to establish useful reference conditions for the ecological \n\nassessment of streams have been proposed and discussed in recent years (e.g., Reynoldson et \n\nal., 1997; Stoddard et al., 2006; Tison, et al., 2007; Hawkins et al., 2010; Birk et al., 2012; \n\nPardo et al., 2012; Feio et al., 2014a). However, recent evaluations of ecological status have \n\ncompared assemblage composition and structure between assessment sites and \u2018least \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n56 \n\ndisturbed\u2019 reference sites (Hawkins et al., 2010). Such assessments do not fully express \n\ndeviations from undisturbed conditions because of the ubiquity of human impacts, many of \n\nwhich are not easily detected and quantified (Chessman and Royal, 2004). To address this \n\nproblem, Chessman and Royal (2004) proposed an alternative approach to establish a \n\nbiological reference condition that does not rely on reference sites. This approach is based on \n\nthe hypothesis that key environmental variables (filters), expressed at multiple scales, \n\ndetermine the composition and structure of local biological communities (Keddy, 1992; Poff, \n\n1997; Quist et al., 2005). The suite of taxa existing at a site under reference conditions is \n\nvisualised as resulting from a natural, top-down filtering process applied to a regional pool of \n\ntaxa, whereby only those taxa with appropriate traits are able to pass the natural filters \n\n(Chessman and Royal, 2004). Thus, knowledge of the environmental tolerances of the taxa in \n\nthe regional pool will allow prediction of the suite of taxa that should occur at a test site \n\nunder reference conditions, provided that reference values of the environmental filters can \n\nbe estimated for that site (Hawkins et al., 2010).  \n\nDiatoms and macroinvertebrates are key components of aquatic ecosystems, belonging \n\nto three trophic levels (primary producers, primary and secondary consumers), and are \n\namong the obligatory BQEs for rivers in the WFD. However, to our knowledge the \n\nenvironmental filters\u2019 approach has not been used to predict the occurrence of diatom \n\nspecies or macroinvertebrates at the genus rank. For the present work, we hypothesised that \n\nthe environmental filters approach could be used to establish biological reference conditions \n\nfor Portuguese lowland streams and rivers that better represent communities existing before \n\nthe effects of human activities, i.e., correspond to a higher level of naturalness, than the \n\npresently used Least Disturbed Condition (LDC) based only on reference sites. In addition, we \n\nfurther developed the filters\u2019 approach of Chessman and Royal (2004) by using the statistical \n\nlearning method of boosted trees to derive reference values of abiotic environmental filters, \n\nbecause we believe that the \u2018best available\u2019 values presently used are in some cases far from \n\nthe reference ones required by the WFD (i.e., pre-human-disturbance conditions). We also \n\nderived reference values for abiotic variables from the literature. \n\nFinally, in order to use such predictions of WFD reference communities in biomonitoring \n\nof lowland streams, we established new reference values and quality class boundaries for the \n\nofficial Portuguese multimetric index for benthic macroinvertebrates and a new multimetric \n\nindex for diatoms. The new index includes the present official diatom index used in Portugal, \n\nthe \u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019 - IPS (Cemagref, 1982), based on species sensitivity \n\nto pollution in general and in addition, the total number of species observed and the number \n\nof sensitive species. We suggest that more weight should be given to sensitive species in the \n\nassessment of biological quality because an increase in the number of such species is a less \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n57 \n\nambiguous indicator of improvement in water quality than changes in relative abundance \n\n(Stevenson et al., 2008).  \n\nIn summary, the main aims of this work were: 1) prediction of WFD biological reference \n\nconditions for macroinvertebrates and diatoms for lowland streams of the central-western \n\nPortuguese region by extending the environmental filters\u2019 approach of Chessman and Royal \n\n(2004) with boosted trees; 2) development and testing of a new multimetric diatom index; \n\nand 3) establishment of new reference values and class boundaries for bioassessment \n\nmethods based on diatoms and macroinvertebrates for this region.  \n\n3.2 Materials and methods \n\n3.2.1 Study area and data source \n\nThe Portuguese central-western region comprises the lowland areas of the catchments \n\nof the Vouga (V), Mondego (M) and Tagus (T) rivers, and the entire catchment of the Lis River \n\n(L), the Ribeiras do Oeste (O) and the Ribeiras do Noroeste (NO). Mondego River is the \n\nlargest river entirely within Portuguese territory with a length of 227 km from mouth to \n\nsource and a catchment area of 6670 km2 (Feio et al., 2007). Tagus River is an international \n\nriver with its source in Spain and a catchment area in Portugal of 24850 km2. Vouga River, \n\nlocated north of the Mondego River, has a catchment area of 3600 km2 and measures 136 km \n\nfrom mouth to source (Feio et al., 2007). Lis River has the smallest catchment of 945 km2 and \n\nis 40 km long from mouth to source (Feio et al., 2007). The Ribeiras do Oeste and Ribeiras do \n\nNoroeste are small lowland streams (mean 40 m a.s.l.) with a small/medium drainage area \n\n(mean 180 km2) (INAG, 2008a). The streams and rivers of this region were included in a \n\nsingle official river type during the implementation of the WFD which was the Littoral type \n\n(Elias et al., 2015). \n\nIn this study, we used a database (AQUAWEB: www.aquaweb.pt) of records of diatom \n\nand macroinvertebrate community composition and abiotic variables covering the whole of \n\nPortugal and a wide variety of natural conditions from mountains (up to 2000 m a.s.l.) to \n\nlowland sedimentary areas, from northern schist and granite dominant lithology to southern \n\nmore alkaline and sedimentary lithology and from temperate Atlantic to Mediterranean \n\nclimates. It characterised both natural site attributes, such as geomorphology and climate, \n\nand also human pressures (Figure 3.1, Table 3.1). We used data from 549 diatom samples and \n\n984 macroinvertebrate samples from 506 sites, of which 167 diatom samples (55 sites) and \n\n218 macroinvertebrate samples (62 sites) were from rivers and streams in the lowland \n\nregion of central Portugal. These data comprised samples collected from 1993 to 2012 \n\n(during the four seasons). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n58 \n\nIn a previous study considering organic pollution and nutrients, hydromorphological \n\nalterations and land use, nine sites in the Portuguese lowland region were considered to be in \n\nLDC (Elias et al., 2015): Canadas (L03), Casal dos Netos (NO103), S\u00e3o Pedro de Muel (O92), \n\nCaldelas (L98), Alcaria (L01), Almagreira (M06), Bot\u00e3o (M18), Foz do Ceira (M09) and Avel\u00e3s \n\nde Cima (V117). Despite being considered in the least disturbed condition these sites present, \n\nhowever, high levels of nutrients (e.g., nitrates and phosphates concentrations reaching 5.1 \n\nmg NO3-\u00b7L-1 and 0.83 mg PO43-\u00b7L-1, respectively) and minimal and small disturbance, according \n\nto Pont et al. (2006) in riparian vegetation and morphology. Samples from these sites, \n\nhereinafter treated as LDC samples and referred to by the site codes above, were used for \n\ncomparative purposes to determine whether the new reference conditions represented an \n\nimprovement on least disturbed conditions. \n\n \nFigure 3.1 - Map of Portuguese rivers showing locations of the lowland sites (white circles) and the \n\nremaining study sites (grey circles). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n59 \n\nTable 3.1 - Characterization and pressure variables included in the study, with ranges of values for \n\nPortuguese lowland sites (n=218 samples from 62 sites). \n\nVariable Range \n\nCharacterization variables  \n\nLatitude (\u00b0N) 38.9264 - 40.7537 \n\nLongitude (\u00b0W) 8.2394 - 9.3602  \n\nPrecipitation (annual mean; mm)a 600 - 1600 \n\nDrainage area (km2)a 0.71 \u2013 5518.43 \n\nAir temperature (annual mean; \u00b0C)a 10.0 \u2013 17.5 \n\nSlope of the drainage area (%)a 1.65 \u2013 24.55 \n\nLithology (categorical)a; b 1 - 17 \n\nRunoff (annual mean; mm)c 81.63 \u2013 1034.71 \n\nDistance to the source (m)a 271 \u2013 230098 \n\nSoil pHa 6.95 \u2013 14.90 \n\nAlkalinity (CaCO3; mg\u00b7L-1) 2.41 \u2013 478.00 \n\nWater temperature (on sampling occasion; \u00b0C)d 3.8 \u2013 24.0 \n\nConductivity (\u00b5S\u00b7cm-1)d 10 \u2013 1388 \n\npH (on sampling occasion)d 5.13 \u2013 11.06 \n\nMineralisation class (% high, medium and low)a; e 0 \u2013 100 \n\nCover of substrata (within ? 500 m of sampling; %)f:  \n\nBedrock 0 \u2013 40 \n\nBoulder 0 \u2013 90 \n\nCobble 0 \u2013 100 \n\nGravel/Pebble 0 \u2013 100 \n\nSand 0  \u2013 100 \n\nSilt 0 \u201350 \n\nClay 0 \u2013 100 \n\nEarth 0 \u2013 100 \n\nPressure variables  \n\nDissolved oxygen (DO; % saturation)d 21 \u2013 146 \n\nAmmonium (N; mg\u00b7L-1)d 0.01 \u2013 18.00 \n\nNitrate (NO3-; mg\u00b7L-1)d 0.03 \u2013 23.90 \n\nNitrite (NO2-; mg\u00b7L-1)d 0.01 \u2013 3.10 \n\nTotal phosphorus (P; mg\u00b7L-1)d 0.01 \u2013 5.15 \n\nPhosphate (PO43-; mg\u00b7L-1)d 0.01 \u2013 4.56 \n\nBiochemical oxygen demand (BOD5; mg\u00b7L?1)d 0.50 \u2013 16.00 \n\nChemical oxygen demand (COD; mg\u00b7L?1)d 1.01 \u2013 289.00 \n\nIntensive agriculture (in the catchment; %)a 0.00 \u2013 92.25 \n\nExtensive agriculture (in the catchment; %)a 0.00 - 50.22 \n\nArtificial areas (in the catchment; %)a 0.00 \u2013 27.04 \n\nNatural and semi-natural areas (in the catchment; %)a; d 2.11 \u2013 100.00 \n\nRiparian vegetation condition (change due to removal of natural \nvegetation or presence of alien species) (category)g; d \n\n1 ( no change) \u2013 5 \n(large change) \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Hard substrata (rocks/stones) were \n\nsampled in each site if present; otherwise sediment was sampled. For epilithic biofilms the \n\nupper surfaces of five submerged stones (an area of ~100 cm2) were scraped with a \n\ntoothbrush and washed with running water, and for epipsammic biofilms a volume of about \n\n50 mL of the upper surface of streambed sediment was collected with a syringe. Samples \n\nwere preserved with formaldehyde (5-10% final concentration) and oxidised with \n\nconcentrated nitric acid and potassium dichromate for about 24h at room temperature. \n\nThereafter, permanent slide mounts in Naphrax\u00ae were prepared and a light microscope \n\n(100x objective and 1.32 numerical aperture) was used to count about 400 diatom valves per \n\nsample at species or infra-specific rank, mainly with Krammer and Lange-Bertalot\u2019s floras \n\n(1986, 1988, 1991a, 1991b) and Krammer (2000, 2001, 2009). \n\nBenthic macroinvertebrate sampling followed the multi-habitat approach described in \n\nINAG (2008b). Briefly, each sample was a composite of six sub-samples from the most \n\nrepresentative habitats (e.g., stones, sand and submerged macrophytes), collected by kicking \n\nand sweeping approximately 1 m towards upstream with a hand net (500 ?m mesh size; \n\n0.25\u00d70.25 m opening). Macroinvertebrate samples were preserved in formaldehyde (4%) \n\nand, after sorting, preserved in ethanol (75%) for later identification and counting. \n\nIdentification, under a stereomicroscope (magnification 60x), was mostly to genus level \n\nexcept for Diptera (sub-family) and Annelida (class). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n61 \n\n3.2.3 Conceptual model development \n\nAs a starting point, a conceptual model (Figure 3.2) was developed to represent the \n\nenvironmental variables (filters) that have the potential to directly influence the composition \n\nof diatom and macroinvertebrate communities and the indirect abiotic variables that are \n\npotentially useful to estimate reference values of the environmental filters. The set of direct \n\nvariables that were selected from a literature review are those provided in Figure 3.2. These \n\nvariables were chosen because both taxonomic composition and structure of diatom and \n\nmacroinvertebrate communities are known to be largely influenced by climate, geology and \n\nwater chemistry (Potapova, 1996; Wallace and Webster, 1996; Tison et al., 2005; Potapova \n\nand Charles, 2007; Smith et al., 2007; Feio et al., 2009; Almeida and Feio, 2012; Marzin et al., \n\n2012). The indirect abiotic variables selected were mean annual precipitation, \n\nmineralization, soil pH and land-use alterations (as agriculture or artificial areas) (Figure \n\n3.2). The variable mineralization reflects the geology of the soil (geological formations) and \n\nits contribution to the water mineralisation. This variable was divided in a three-class scale: \n\nlow (composed essentially by acid rocks), medium (composed essentially by alkaline rocks) \n\nand high mineralisation (composed essentially by sedimentary rocks) (INAG, 2008a). \n\nValues of the direct variables (Figure 3.2) were obtained from cartographic sources or \n\nassessed at each site, with the exception of the runoff values which were estimated from an \n\nannual water balance. Ignoring exchanges with other catchments, the water balance was \n\nexpressed by the equation P=H+E, where P is annual precipitation, E is annual \n\nevapotranspiration and H is annual runoff (Hip\u00f3lito and Vaz, 2011). P is an observed value \n\nand E was calculated with Turc\u2019s (1954) method. P and H values were validated against \n\ncartographic sources. \n\n3.2.4 Defining abiotic reference conditions \n\nBoosted trees (BT) technique was used to predict reference values of environmental \n\nfilters. This technique aims to improve the performance of a single model by fitting many \n\nmodels and combining them for prediction (Elith et al., 2008). BT uses two algorithms: \n\nregression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) \n\nand boosting (that works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted \n\nversions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of \n\nclassifiers thus produced) (Friedman et al. 2000; Elith et al., 2008). The general idea of BT is \n\nto compute a sequence of simple trees, where each successive tree is built for the prediction \n\nresiduals of the preceding tree. This method builds binary trees (i.e., partition the data into \n\ntwo samples at each split node) whose complexity is limited to 3 nodes only: a root node and \n\ntwo child nodes, i.e., a single split. Thus, at each step of the boosting (boosting trees \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n62 \n\nalgorithm), a simple (best) partitioning of the data is determined, and the deviations of the \n\nobserved values from the respective means (residuals for each partition) are computed.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2 - Conceptual model showing the abiotic variables that directly influence the composition of \n\ndiatom and macroinvertebrate communities (connections via dashed lines) and those useful to \n\nestimate values of other abiotic variables (connections via solid lines). See Table 3.1 for variable \n\ndescriptions. \n\nThe next 3-node tree will then be fitted to those residuals, to find another partition that will \n\nfurther reduce the residual (error) variance for the data, given the preceding sequence of \n\ntrees (STATISTICA 7, StatSoft Inc.). Such \u2018additive weighted expansions\u2019 of trees can \n\neventually produce an excellent fit of the predicted values to the observed values, even if the \n\nspecific nature of the relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent \n\nvariable of interest is very complex (nonlinear in nature). Hence, the method of gradient \n\nboosting - fitting a weighted additive expansion of simple trees - represents a very general \n\nand powerful machine learning algorithm (STATISTICA 7, StatSoft Inc.). The BT method \n\nincludes all the desirable properties of classification and regression trees (CART): (1) \n\nhandling different types of predictor variables including numeric and categorical variables; \n\n(2) being invariant to monotonic transformations of the predictors, so that a priori data \n\ntransformation or elimination of outliers is not necessary; (3) simply modelling complex \n\ninteractions; and (4) managing missing values in the predictors with minimal loss of \n\ninformation (Leathwick et al., 2006; De\u2019ath, 2007; Elith et al., 2008). Additionally, boosted \n\ntrees overcome two of CART\u2019s weaknesses: poor prediction performance and interpretation \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n63 \n\ndifficulties for large trees (De\u2019ath, 2007; Elith et al., 2008). The analyses were carried out \n\nthrough the statistical software STATISTICA 7 (StatSoft Inc.). \n\nThe application of the BT to predicting the environmental data was performed in two \n\nsteps. First, models were developed to predict observed concentrations of dissolved oxygen \n\n(DO), phosphates, ammonium and nitrate from linked abiotic explanatory variables in the \n\nconceptual model (Figure 3.2). For example, nitrate concentrations were modelled from \n\nlithology, land use, mineralization and soil pH. The model training data were the entire \n\nabiotic dataset, covering a wide variety of spatial and temporal conditions (all sampled \n\nPortuguese river types, various disturbance levels and all seasons), but with 10% of samples \n\nexcluded randomly for model validation. Two thousand trees were run with a learning rate of \n\n0.1. Model quality was evaluated through the R2 value of observed-predicted regression for \n\nthe training set, with a minimum value for model acceptance of 0.5. The ratio of the Mean \n\nSquared Errors (MSEs) of the training and validation datasets was also calculated in order to \n\ntest whether the value was close to one, which was considered optimal. \n\nSecond, the accepted models were used to predict reference values of DO and nutrients \n\nfor the lowland streams in all seasons. For this purpose, a new dataset with manipulated data \n\nwas created for the lowland samples, with the observed values of the model predictors \n\nreplaced by values corresponding to undisturbed conditions. Values of the predictors related \n\nto land use were set to 0, i.e., no or minor changes from natural conditions (Table 3.2), \n\nwhereas values of climatic, topographic and geological predictors remained unchanged. This \n\nnew dataset was then run as test data in the previous created boosted tree models to \n\nestimate reference DO and nutrient values. Values thus obtained for the lowland samples \n\nwere used to build a complete dataset of abiotic reference values by adding the variables \n\nriparian vegetation, morphological condition and sediment load, with all values set to 1, \n\ncorresponding to no or minor modifications, instead of the observed values. All other \n\nenvironmental filters not influenced by human disturbance remained unchanged. \n\nTable 3.2 - Abiotic pressure variables for which values were altered to predict reference communities. \n\nVariable Reference value \n\nTotal dissolved oxygen (DO; %) Observed value retained if ? 73.7 and ? \n127.9%, otherwise replaced by 73.7% if &lt;73.7 \nor 127.9% if > 127.9 (from Feio et al., 2014a) \n\nAmmonium (N; mg\u00b7L-1) Observed value retained if ? to 0.09 mg\u00b7L-1, \notherwise replaced by 0.09 (from Feio et al., \n2014a) \n\nNitrate (NO3-; mg\u00b7L-1) Estimated by boosted tree analysis \n\nPhosphates (PO43-; mg\u00b7L-1) Observed value retained if ? to 0.06 mg\u00b7L-1, \notherwise replaced by 0.06 (from Feio et al., \n2014a) \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

For diatoms, the species considered \u2018exotic/invader\u2019 \n\naccording to the \u2018Indice Biologique Diatom\u00e9es\u2019-IBD (Prygiel and Coste, 2000) and Coste and \n\nEctor (2000) was Achnanthidium subhudsonis (Hustedt) H. Kobayasi; for macroinvertebrates \n\nthe species considered exotic were Corbicula fluminea and Procambarus clarki. Second, all \n\ntaxa present in fewer than 5% of samples (27 samples for diatoms and 49 for \n\nmacroinvertebrates) were eliminated from the observed and predicted lists as we considered \n\nthat these taxa were insufficiently represented to determine their tolerance limits with \n\nconfidence. We determined the upper and lower tolerance limits of each remaining taxon for \n\neach environmental filter (dashed lines in Figure 3.2). These limits were set as the range of \n\nvalues at which a taxon was present in the national dataset (all sites and seasons), after \n\nremoving extremes, considered as values > 75th percentile+3*(75th percentile-25th percentile) \n\nor &lt;25th percentile-3*(75th percentile -25th percentile). \n\nFinally, we compared the abiotic reference values predicted for each lowland site (from \n\nthe previous section 3.2.4) with the tolerance ranges for each taxon. If a taxon\u2019s tolerance \n\nranges included all the abiotic reference values predicted for a given site, the taxon was \n\nincluded in the list of taxa predicted for that site under reference conditions. Predicted and \n\nobserved taxon lists were compared for samples collected in spring (90 samples for diatoms \n\nand 122 for macroinvertebrates) because the LDC reference values currently used are based \n\non spring data only. If a site had more than one spring sample, the samples were combined in \n\norder to obtain a single observed and predicted list per site (55 and 62 sites for diatoms and \n\nmacroinvertebrates, respectively). As the filters approach predicts only presence or absence \n\nof taxa, the data from the observed lists of taxa were also converted to presence/absence. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n65 \n\nDifferences between the observed and predicted spring communities (diatoms and \n\nmacroinvertebrates analysed separately) were depicted by non-metric multidimensional \n\nscaling (MDS) (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity measure) and statistically tested with a \n\npermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA global test) with unrestricted \n\npermutations. Additionally, a similarity percentage analysis, SIMPER (Bray\u2013Curtis similarity \n\nmeasure) was performed to determine the within-community similarity of the observed and \n\npredicted communities. Additional PERMANOVA pairwise tests with unrestricted \n\npermutations were performed to compare LDC and non-LDC sites (see section 3.2.1). The \n\nreliability of the two-dimensional images of the multidimensional relationship between the \n\nsamples is indicated by a stress value (Clarke and Warwick, 2001; Clarke and Gorley, 2006). \n\nStress values &lt;0.05 are excellent, leaving little danger of misinterpretation, stress values &lt;\n\n0.1 correspond to a good representation of the similarities between the samples and stress \n\nvalues > 0.2 indicate that not too much reliance should be placed on details (Clarke and \n\nWarwick, 2001). All these analyses were done in PRIMER 6 &amp; PERMANOVA. \n\n3.2.6 Quality assessment and diatom index development \n\nThe official indices currently accepted in Portugal were used to compare biological \n\nquality assessments based on the LDC and filters reference conditions for all the lowland sites \n\nsampled in spring. These are the IPS index (Cemagref, 1982) for diatoms and the multimetric \n\n\u2018\u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados\u2019 (IPtIs\u2013INAG, 2009; Ferreira et al., 2008) for \n\nmacroinvertebrates (Equation 3.1). \n \n\n????? =\n\n?\u00ba??? .\n\n?\u00ba??? .??? .\n\u00d7 0.4 +  \n\n???\n\n??? ??? .\n\u00d7 0.2 +  \n\n(????? ?2)\n\n?????? ?2 ??? .\n\u00d7 0.2 +\n\n???

This new index also contains \n\ntwo other metrics: the number of sensitive taxa and total taxa richness (Equation 3.2). The \n\nmetric \u2018sensitive taxa\u2019 includes diatoms with sensitivity value ? to 4.5 according to the IPS \n\n(Cemagref, 1982 and updated in OMNIDIA software V.5.5) and a higher probability of being \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

In \n\nthe latter, reference median values of the diatom metrics number of taxa and number of \n\nsensitive taxa (Equation 3.2) and the macroinvertebrate metrics number of families, EPT and \n\nIASPT \u2013 2 (Equation 3.1) were obtained from the lists of taxa predicted for each lowland site \n\nwith the filters approach (see section 3.2.5). Because the macroinvertebrate index was \n\ncreated at the taxonomic level of family, filters\u2019 predictions at finer taxonomic levels were \n\namalgamated to family level prior to derivation of metric reference values. The filters \n\napproach could not be used to produce reference values for those metrics that require \n\nabundance data, i.e., IPS for diatoms in Equation 3.2 and EPTCD for macroinvertebrates in \n\nEquation 3.1, because it predicted only presence or absence of taxa. Consequently, median \n\nspring values for the nine lowland LDC sites were used instead for those metrics. Some LDC \n\nsites had multiple spring samples (range 1-3; total of 12 samples), which were averaged \n\nbefore medians were calculated. The overall reference values for the MDI (denominator in \n\nEquation 3.2) and IPtIs (denominator in Equation 3.1) were the median values calculated for \n\nthe nine lowland LDC sites with metric reference values derived as described above.  \n\nWeighting factors (wf) were applied to individual metrics in the new MDI (Equation 3.2), \n\nas is done for the IPtI, so that metrics responding strongly to human disturbance would \n\ncontribute more to the overall score (Hering et al., 2006). The following steps were taken to \n\nobtain wf values. First, a Principal Components Analysis (rotated PCA; PRIMER 6 &amp; \n\nPERMANOVA) was applied to normalised data for all samples from the lowland streams (all \n\nseasons) for environmental variables that express anthropogenic pressure on diatom \n\ncommunities (Table 3.1, footnote d). Second, sample scores on the PCA axes that represented \n\nmost variation in the data (typically axes 1, 2 and 3) were correlated (Spearman rank \n\ncorrelation coefficient; STATISTICA 7 software, StatSoft Inc.) with corresponding IPS values, \n\nnumber of taxa and number of sensitive taxa. Finally, the average correlation with each \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n67 \n\nmetric was normalised so that the correlations summed to 100%, and the normalised \n\ncorrelations were used as metric wf. \n\nAs reference values for the IPS were defined only for spring, a second normalised PCA \n\nwas performed to verify which of the diatom indices MDI or IPS, better reflected the \n\npressures affecting the lowland streams in that season. Spearman rank correlations \n\n(STATISTICA 7 software, StatSoft Inc.) were calculated between diatom index values and PCA \n\naxes derived from spring samples only. \n\nFor the two PCA Pearson correlation coefficient (STATISTICA 7 software, StatSoft Inc.) \n\nbetween the pressure variables on the first three components and each of the original \n\nvariables were also performed.  \n\nAdditionally, new biological quality classes were established for the MDI and IPtIs based \n\non their values for the LDC sites derived with the new reference data. The establishment of \n\nclass boundaries followed the methods used by Ferreira et al. (2008) and recommended by \n\nHering et al. (2006). All sites were assessed with these two new classification systems as well \n\nas the existing ones. \n\nAll IPS calculations were done in OMNIDIA software V.5.5 (Lecointe et al., 1993). \n\n3.3 Results \n\n3.3.1 Defining abiotic reference conditions \n\nThe boosted tree model for nitrate was acceptable with R2=0.52 for linear regression of \n\nobserved and predicted values for the training data (Figure 3.3) and a training/validation \n\nratio of MSE of 0.81 (n=701). All the predictor variables had some importance in the analysis \n\n(ranking on a 0-1.00 scale, with higher numbers indicating stronger influence on the \n\nresponse) with values ranging from 0.22 (low mineralisation class) to 1.00 (extensive \n\nagriculture). The maximum modelled nitrate value for the lowland streams under reference \n\nconditions was 3.64 mg NO3-\u00b7L-1 whereas the maximum observed value was 23.9 mg NO3-\u00b7L-1 \n\n(Figure 3.4). \n\nWe were unable to obtain robust models for DO, phosphates and ammonium because of \n\ndata limitations such as high detection limits, and consequently some predicted values were \n\nnot realistic. Therefore, we decided not to use boosted trees to estimate reference values for \n\nthese variables, and instead used values from Feio et al. (2014a) for Mediterranean rivers in \n\nLDC, which generally represented an improvement on measured values for the lowland \n\nstreams (Table 3.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

The median number of taxa per site predicted under reference conditions \n\nby the environmental filters method was 69 while the median number observed was 27. The \n\nmedian number of sensitive taxa predicted was 11 compared to 4 observed. \n\nThe number of taxa predicted to occur in more than 50% of the sites (67) was also much \n\nhigher than the number of observed (18). Taxa that were predicted to be almost ubiquitous \n\nwere Achnanthidium minutissimum (K\u00fctzing) Czarnecki (96%), Nitzschia palea (K\u00fctzing) W. \n\nSmith (96%), Navicula gregaria Donkin (95%) and Eolimna minima (Grunow) Lange-Bertalot \n\n&amp; W. Schiller (94%). The taxa most frequently observed were A. minutissimum (87%), E. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n69 \n\nminima (87%), N. gregaria (84%) and Planothidium lanceolatum (Brebisson ex K\u00fctzing) \n\nLange-Bertalot (80%) (reported in detail in the Appendix II).  \n\nThe majority (98%) of the observed taxa were predicted under reference conditions in \n\nat least one site. The exception was Platessa conspicua (A. Mayer) Lange-Bertalot, which was \n\nobserved in 9% of the sites but not predicted, primarily because its furthest distance to the \n\nsource was found to be 1033.7 m. Melosira varians C. Agardh was observed at 71% of the \n\nsites but was seldom predicted (4%), mainly because its estimated tolerance range for mean \n\nannual air temperature was limited between 17.5 and 20.0 \u00b0C. Conversely, some taxa were \n\ninfrequently observed but often predicted, including Cyclotella meneghiniana K\u00fctzing, \n\nNavicula capitatoradiata H. Germain, Nitzschia frustulum (K\u00fctzing) Grunow and Staurosira \n\nventer (Ehrenberg) Cleve &amp; J. D. M\u00f6eller; in 60-66% of the sites, these taxa were predicted but \n\nnot collected. Navicula angusta Grunow was predicted in 4% of the sites but never observed. \n\nOne of the 115 taxa, Frustulia erifuga Lange-Bertalot &amp; Krammer, was the only taxon neither \n\npredicted nor observed. This taxon was not predicted because it was found only at a mean \n\nannual air temperature value of 12.5 \u00b0C which was never recorded in the lowland sites.  \n\nThe predicted reference diatom communities were statistically different from the \n\nobserved communities (PERMANOVA: Pseudo-F=13.998, p=0.001) and more homogeneous, \n\nwith average Bray-Curtis similarity between sites of 62% for the predicted communities and \n\n40% for the observed ones (SIMPER analysis). The MDS stress value (0.13) and PERMANOVA \n\ncomparisons of sites considered to be in LDC with the remaining sites revealed no significant \n\nstatistical differences for either observed or predicted communities (Figure 3.5, Table 3.3). \n\nHowever, the observed and predicted communities were significantly different for both LDC \n\nand non-LDC sites (Table 3.3).  \n\nThe filters (Figure 3.2), lithology, mean annual temperature, runoff and alkalinity \n\nexcluded at least one taxon from the prediction for every site. Distance to source also filtered \n\none or more taxa from 98% of the sites. Among the pressure variables used as filters, those \n\nthat most frequently excluded taxa were DO (26%), phosphates (22%) and nitrate (22%). \n\nTable 3.3 - PERMANOVA results for pairwise comparisons among observed diatom communities and \n\npredicted reference communities.

The median number of \n\nfamilies per site predicted under reference conditions by the environmental filters method \n\nwas 53 while the median number observed was 22. Of the 73 families, 66 belonged to the \n\norders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) that include sensitive taxa. The \n\nmedian number of EPT families predicted was 18 compared to 6 observed. \n\nThe number of families predicted to occur in more than 50% of the sites (57) was also \n\nmuch higher than the number of observed families (13). The families most frequently \n\npredicted were Physidae (95%), Hydrobiidae (95%), Baetidae (94%), Chironomidae (94%) \n\nand Limoniidae (94%), while those most frequently observed were Chironomidae (100%), \n\nOligochaeta (95%), Baetidae (86%), Simuliidae (82%) and Caenidae (74%) (reported in \n\ndetail in the Appendix III).  \n\nThe majority (97%) of the predicted macroinvertebrates families were observed in at \n\nleast one site. Chloroperlidae and Perlidae were exceptions, being predicted in 15% and 27% \n\nof sites respectively but never observed. Goeridae and Planariidae were infrequently \n\npredicted (13%) but also seldom collected (&lt;5%). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n71 \n\nThe MDS illustrates that the predicted and observed communities are separated in the \n\nplot (Figure 3.6). Despite the stress value obtained (0.15) the two-dimensional plot can still \n\nbe viewed as a useful representation of the multidimensional picture as the predicted \n\ncommunities were also statistically different from the observed communities (PERMANOVA: \n\nPseudo-F=13.679, p=0.001) and more homogeneous (average inter-site similarity of 69% for \n\npredicted and 46% for observed communities) (Figure 3.6). Macroinvertebrate communities \n\nobserved in LDC sites were also not statistically different from those observed at disturbed \n\nsites, but the observed and predicted communities were significantly different for both LDC \n\nand non-LDC sites (Table 3.4). \n\nAll of the characterisation variables (Table 3.1) that were treated as filters (Figure 3.2) \n\nfrequently excluded at least one family from the predictions for individual sites (frequencies \n\nup to 98%). The pressure variables treated as filters that most frequently excluded families \n\nwere DO and phosphates (100%).

The weighting factors \n\nobtained from these correlations were highest for the number of sensitive taxa (wf3) and \n\nlowest for the total number of taxa (wf2) (Table 3.7). Median reference IPS and MDI values \n\nbased on the nine LDC sites are shown in Table 3.7; ranges were 13.4-18.9 for the IPS and \n\n0.70-1.29 for the MDI.  \n\nThe three first axes of the PCA based on spring data accounted for 45.3% of variation \n\n(Table 3.5). \n\nSpearman correlations between the MDI and IPS values and the first axis (spring PCA) \n\nwere highly negative and significant (rs=0.54 and rs=0.55 respectively; p<0.05). However, the \n\nMDI also had a significant negative correlation with the second axis (rs=0.28, p<0.05).  \n\nBoundaries for quality classes based on the MDI (EQR) calculated for the LDC sites with \n\nnew reference values (Table 3.8) led to lower classifications of samples than the IPS (Figure \n\n3.7), i.e., the MDI assigned lower quality than the IPS. \n\n \n\nMacroinvertebrates \n\nThe environmental filters approach provided new reference values for all metrics not \n\nrequiring abundance data, whereas the reference values for Log(Sel. EPTCD+1) and IPtIs \n\nwere the median observed values for the LDC sites (Table 3.9). IPtIs values at these sites \n\nranged from 0.81 to 1.31. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n73 \n\nBoundaries for quality classes based on the IPtIs (EQR) calculated for the LDC sites with \n\nnew reference values (Table 3.8) were consistently lower than the boundaries currently \n\nestablished for Portugal (INAG, 2009). The IPtIs calculated with the environmental filters \n\napproach placed the samples in a lower classes than the IPtIs currently used (Figure 3.8). \n\nTable 3.5 - Pearson correlation coefficient between the pressure variables on the first three \n\ncomponents from principal components analysis (PCA) of data for all seasons and spring only and each \n\nof the original variables.

Even when modelling techniques are applied in \n\ndetermining biological reference condition, reference sites, near-natural or least disturbed \n\nsites have been used (Tison et al., 2007; Almeida and Feio, 2012; Feio et al., 2012; Feio and \n\nDol\u00e9dec, 2012; Feio et al., 2014b; Pardo et al., 2014). Our study demonstrates that the filters\u2019 \n\napproach with modelling of abiotic reference values enables determination of biological \n\nreference conditions for both diatoms and macroinvertebrates with less dependence on \n\nreference sites. Our approach, using a combination of modelling and data from LDC sites, \n\nexemplifies the third option for determining reference conditions allowed by the WFD.  \n\n \n\nPredicting the lowland reference community: diatoms and macroinvertebrates \n\nThe boosted trees successfully modelled reference values of nitrate for the lowland \n\nstreams but could not be used for other abiotic variables because of high analytical detection \n\nlimits. Our maximum reference nitrate value (3.64 mg\u00b7L-1) was high, however was within the \n\nrange of threshold values for various river types of 2-6 mg\u00b7L-1 below which Pardo et al. \n\n(2012) considered a site to be \u2018probably reference\u2019. Feio et al. (2014a) set a lower threshold \n\nfor Mediterranean areas (? 1.15 mg\u00b7L-1), but for a wider geographic region than the lowland \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n76 \n\narea considered in the present study. Additionally, the lowland streams as streams with \n\ntypically moderate to null slope are naturally more sensitive to eutrophication and show \n\nlower reference notes (Tison et al., 2007). \n\nApplication of the filters approach incorporating boosted trees should have predicted \n\nreference data closer to the WFD reference condition for diatoms and macroinvertebrates. \n\nFor both groups, the predicted communities were statistically different from the observed \n\ncommunities, and the observed communities were less homogeneous, as would be expected \n\nwith sites having variable levels of change from reference conditions. The median number of \n\npredicted taxa was more than double the median number of observed taxa, probably \n\nreflecting the elimination of taxa by anthropogenic pressures. However, other factors may \n\nalso have contributed to the absence of predicted taxa from the collected samples. For \n\ndiatoms it was assumed that the counting of about 400 valves per sample was sufficient to \n\nestablish community composition (e.g., Prygiel et al., 2002), but ring-testing has shown that \n\nto achieve a full picture of a diatom community, subsamples should be collected within a \n\nlarger transect of the stream site and the slide should be searched a posteriori to detect rare \n\ntaxa that may be missed in the 400 valve count (Besse-Lototskaya et al., 2006). Consequently, \n\nrare taxa are absent in the observed communities and present (we considered all taxa \n\npredicted) in the predicted communities. Moreover, for diatoms only one type of substrate \n\nwas sampled, usually rock/stone. Nevertheless, the median ratio of numbers of predicted and \n\nobserved taxa was very similar for diatoms and macroinvertebrates (2.56 and 2.41, \n\nrespectively), even though macroinvertebrates were collected from multiple substrata at \n\neach site and all individuals in a macroinvertebrate sample were counted (depending of the \n\nriver these counting\u2019s often reached values above 400 individuals). \n\nIn some cases, taxa were observed at a site where they were not predicted to occur. This \n\ncould indicate anthropogenic influences making a stream suitable for taxa that would not \n\nnaturally occur there. However, it could also have resulted from limitations in estimation of \n\nthe natural environmental attributes of the sites and environmental tolerance ranges of the \n\ntaxa (Chessman and Royal, 2004). \n\nDiatoms that were frequently predicted under reference conditions (e.g., Achnanthidium \n\nminutissimum, Eolimna minima, Nitzschia palea, Navicula gregaria, Planothidium lanceolatum, \n\nCyclotella meneghiniana, Gomphonema parvulum (K\u00fctzing) K\u00fctzing, Nitzschia inconspicua \n\nGrunow, Planothidium frequentissimum (Lange-Bertalot) Lange-Bertalot and Sellaphora \n\nseminulum (Grunow) D. G. Mann are considered cosmopolitan and near ubiquitous in \n\ncontinental waters (Potapova and Charles, 2002). Some of these species have been \n\nconsidered to indicate eutrophic conditions (e.g., N. inconspicua, G. parvulum, E. minima, N. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n77 \n\ngregaria; van Dam et al., 1994) but they may also occur in lower numbers in streams \n\nconsidered to have good water quality (Delgado et al., 2012; Almeida et al., 2014). \n\nThe only two diatom species predicted but never collected in the lowland streams \n\n(Navicula angusta and Frustulia erifuga) are sensitive to degradation. N. angusta was found in \n\na previous study of Portuguese streams (of the same type as the streams in this study) and \n\nshowed a preference for low conductivity and acid waters (Almeida and Gil, 2001). F. erifuga \n\nis a mobile, high-profile species forming a mucous tubule colony (Rimet and Bouchez, 2012). \n\nSpecies with similar morphological traits, such as Encyonema minutum (Hilse) D. G. Mann and \n\nEncyonema silesiacum (Bleisch) D. G. Mann, were frequently collected in the lowland streams, \n\nsuggesting that chemical factors rather than physical habitat are responsible for the absence \n\nof F. erifuga.  \n\nThe macroinvertebrates that were commonly predicted under reference conditions \n\nincluded taxa characteristic of lowland sites as well as taxa requiring habitat conditions that \n\nare rarely found there. For example, the families Chloroperlidae and Perlidae that are very \n\nsensitive according to the IBMWP scoring system (Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002) were predicted \n\nfor some sites but never observed. These families require cool, oxygenated waters and gravel \n\nor rocky bottoms, which are naturally present in only a few of lowland streams, especially \n\nthose in the transition to other river types (Tachet et al., 2010). The taxa predicted most \n\nfrequently included the gastropods Physidae and Hydrobiidae, which were expected because \n\nthe characteristic bottom sediment at the lowland sites is sand, and families that are nearly \n\nubiquitous in streams and rivers, such as the Chironomidae. However, this family comprises a \n\ngreat diversity of species (estimated at 20,000) with quite variable pollution tolerances \n\n(Coffman, 1995; Servia et al., 2004), so it is probable that sensitive taxa among this family \n\ncould also be expected if a lowest level of resolution was used. \n\nThe filters most often responsible for exclusions of diatom and macroinvertebrate taxa \n\nfrom site predictions were mean annual temperature, runoff and variables related to geology \n\n(lithology and alkalinity). Such variables have been reported in other studies as influencing \n\ndiatom and macroinvertebrate distributions (e.g., Potapova and Charles, 2002; Rimet et al., \n\n2004; Tison et al., 2005; Feio et al., 2007; Rimet, 2009; Hawkins et al. 2010; Almeida and Feio, \n\n2012). As expected, the pressure variables treated as filters excluded few taxa when set to \n\npredicted values in the absence of anthropogenic influence (reference values). In spite of \n\ntheir importance, some of the filters we applied are not direct determinants of diatom and \n\nmacroinvertebrate community composition but rather surrogate predictors (Clarke et al., \n\n2003). For example, mean annual air temperature, obtained from cartographic sources, was \n\nused here as a surrogate of water temperature and was responsible for the total exclusion of \n\nFrustulia erifuga and frequent exclusion of Melosira varians from the diatom reference \n\nlowland communities. Prediction directly from the annual range of water temperature would \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n78 \n\nhave been more desirable, but would have required installing electronic temperature loggers \n\n(Clarke et al., 2003). It is also possible that the modelled reference nitrate value is too high \n\n(as discussed above), and consequently sometimes wrongly excluded taxa with low upper \n\ntolerance limits for nitrate from predictions under reference conditions. \n\n \n\nIndex development and quality assessment \n\nFor diatoms, application of the new multimetric index to all sites produced strong \n\ncorrelations with the pressure variables, providing a more comprehensive assessment of \n\nbiological quality than the IPS (significant correlations with two PCA axes cf. only one axis). \n\nThis improvement in performance was probably due to the inclusion of the number of \n\nsensitive species, as indicated by the high correlation of this metric with the PCA axes. \n\nDespite the limitations we encountered (e.g., in using boosted trees with some \n\nenvironmental variables), our hypothesis was supported. All of the samples from sites \n\nconsidered to be in LDC were rated as poorer biological quality with the reference values \n\nderived from the present work than with the existing reference values, indicating that the \n\nnew reference values created more stringent criteria. This difference was more evident for \n\nmacroinvertebrates, as almost all the samples considered to be in LDC were assessed as \n\nhaving high biological quality with the old reference values but poor biological quality with \n\nthe new values. With the old system, the macroinvertebrate index rated many samples in a \n\nhigher lower quality class than the IPS (EQR) did, but with the new system this difference was \n\nreversed. \n\nWith the new methods, the assessments based on diatoms and macroinvertebrates \n\nbecame more similar, suggesting that the filters approach accounted for pressures that are \n\npresently affecting both diatom and macroinvertebrate communities in the lowland streams. \n\nHowever, differences in assessment between the two communities were evident for some \n\nsamples, possibly because of differences in the responses of diatoms and macroinvertebrates \n\nto particular stressors. For example, sample 10 from site M09 was assessed as moderate by \n\ndiatom analysis (Figure 3.7) and poor by the macroinvertebrate analysis (Figure 3.8). In this \n\ncase the macroinvertebrate community may have responded to changes in the riparian \n\nvegetation and morphological condition of the site while the diatoms may have reacted to \n\nminor changes in water chemistry. Feio et al. (2007) also found the same site could be \n\nassessed differently by predictive models applied to diatom and macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities. \n\nDespite the results obtained by this new method that were, according to our expertise \n\nknowledge, closer to the reality of lowland streams and rivers it is useful to remain aware \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n79 \n\nthat all the methodological decision that we made can affect the stream assessment and its \n\ntrue uncertainty (Clarke, 2013). \n\nStream communities are controlled mainly by physical and chemical factors (Chessman \n\nand Royal, 2004; Lange et al., 2011), but biotic interactions such as competition and \n\npredation, which were not explored in this work, can also influence the composition of the \n\ncommunities. Therefore, additional filters related to biotic factors may be a useful inclusion in \n\nfuture development of the approach (Chessman and Royal, 2004). \n\n3.5 Conclusions \n\nThis study brings new insight to help solve the problem of the lack of acceptable \n\nreference sites. Additionally, the new multimetric index for diatoms seems to hold much \n\npromise as there was a good correlation between the number of sensitive species and \n\nanthropogenic pressures. Although data limitations prevented us from modelling abiotic \n\nvariables other than nitrate successfully, we believe that such modelling has great future \n\npotential. And despite the wealth of available information on the ecological preferences of \n\ndiatom and macroinvertebrates, their tolerance limits are still far from fully documented. \n\nMore work is necessary in this respect, including microcosm or mesocosm experiments that \n\nenable a high degree of control of environmental factors. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nBQE Biological Quality Elements \n\nBT Boosted Trees \n\nEQR Ecological Quality Ratios \n\nEU European Union \n\nIBD Indice Biologique Diatom\u00e9es \n\nIPS Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique \n\nIPtI \u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados \n\nLDC Least Disturbed Condition \n\nMDI Multimetric Diatom Index \n\nMDS non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Four Atlantic-temperate Portuguese streams were sampled on \n\nthree occasions; spring before the drought, two weeks after the return of water to the \n\nstreambed, and spring after the drought. The traits from diatom and macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities from temperate streams were also compared with those from Mediterranean \n\nsystems to assess possible shifts in traits. The effects from stream drying were long-lasting \n\nfor macroinvertebrates; however, only the diatom trait proportions shifted towards \n\nproportions similar to those occurring in Mediterranean streams. There was a significant \n\nreduction of macroinvertebrates with the ability to produce cocoons, to disperse actively by \n\nflight and passively disperse in the water and of swimmers following the return of water. A \n\ndecrease in stalked species immediately after drought was evident in diatom communities. In \n\ncontrast to temperate communities, Mediterranean ones were characterised by larger and \n\nless mobile diatoms, and smaller-bodied macroinvertebrates with shorter life cycles. \n\nAdditional studies are required to determine the long-term effect of uncharacteristic drought \n\nevents on biological traits and their ecosystem functions in typically perennial streams. \n\nKeywords \n\nClimatic changes, diatoms, extreme events, macroinvertebrates, Mediterranean, streams, \n\ntemperate, traits \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n90 \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nClimate forecasts predict a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration \n\nby the end of this century and a rise in world mean air temperature between 1.8 and 4.0 \u00b0C \n\n(IPCC, 2007). In central Europe, heat waves are predicted to be more frequent, more intense \n\nand longer in duration. Heavy winter precipitation is also predicted to increase in central and \n\nnorthern Europe, and decrease in the south (IPCC, 2007; IPCC, 2013). The southern part of \n\nEurope will also suffer a predicted decrease in summer precipitation (Beniston et al., 2007). \n\nThese changes in precipitation, temperature and consequently evapotranspiration rates will \n\naffect volumes of surface water runoff. Model simulations predict a 10-30% decrease in \n\nannual runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe and in the western United States by the \n\nmid-century (Milly et al., 2005; IPCC, 2007). In contrast, other models predict a decrease in \n\nannual runoff in southern Europe that may reach as much as 50% of the current levels \n\n(Arnell, 1999). Typically temperate and rainy climate areas (e.g., central Europe) will become \n\nmore similar to Mediterranean climate areas that are characterised by mild wet winters and \n\nhot dry summers (Giorgi and Lionello, 2008), thus suggesting its expansion to northern \n\nregions. \n\nIn south-western Europe, Portugal was affected by a severe and uncharacteristic \n\ndrought event from the end of summer 2011 to the winter of 2012. February 2012 was the \n\ndriest February recorded since 1931, with a total monthly precipitation of 1-10 mm against a \n\nlong-term mean of 50-150 mm (IPMA, I.P.; http://www.ipma.pt, accessed 8 May 2012). The \n\nlow precipitation recorded during this drought event led to the complete drying of surface \n\nwater in river channels of some typically Atlantic-temperate watercourses. Drought events \n\nwith flow cessation are characteristic of Mediterranean climates where streams are \n\nphysically, chemically and biologically shaped by sequential, predictable and seasonal events \n\nof flooding and drying over an annual hydrological cycle (Boix et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., \n\n2011; Delgado et al., 2012). For Atlantic-temperate areas, such flow conditions are \n\nuncommon. \n\nFloods and droughts are important hydrologic events in running water ecosystems. \n\nTherefore, in-stream biological communities have developed adaptations that range from the \n\navoidance of individual floods or droughts, to life-history strategies that are synchronised \n\nwith long-term flow patterns (Lytle and Poff, 2004). The traits developed by species in order \n\nto enable them to survive, exploit and even depend on disturbance are the result of a long \n\nevolutionary period (Lytle and Poff, 2004). In Mediterranean streams during the summer, \n\norganisms exhibit strategies such as low metabolic rates, short life spans with an early \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n91 \n\nmaturity, less permeable cuticles and higher water content (Bonada et al., 2007a). That is, the \n\nnative communities of drought-prone systems are the result of a multihabitat filter process \n\nthat selects organisms with a set of traits that enable them to either survive the drought \n\n(resistance traits) or recolonise and recruit after the drought breaks (resilience traits) (Poff, \n\n1997; Bond et al., 2008). However, the communities of rivers exposed to rapid changes in \n\nnatural flow conditions (i.e., magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and predictability) are \n\ndeprived of such an evolutionary period. Changes in the natural flow of temperate streams \n\ndue to extreme events or climate change may therefore exert stronger effects on the \n\necological structure and functioning of stream communities (Lake, 2000).  \n\nThe use of biological traits in the study of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities has \n\nincreased in the last decade (e.g., Gayraud et al., 2003; Bonada et al., 2007a; Chessman, 2012; \n\nFeio and Dol\u00e9dec, 2012; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., 2013) as they can be related to ecosystem \n\nfunctions (e.g., decomposition, productivity, energy cycling, relationship between different \n\ntrophic levels) and thus act as potential indicators of a system\u2019s integrity (Statzner et al., \n\n2001; Feio and Dol\u00e9dec, 2012). However, to our knowledge, only the study by Bonada et al. \n\n(2007a) was aimed at assessing the trait differences between Mediterranean and temperate \n\nregions and only for aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. More recently, Garc\u00eda-Roger et \n\nal. (2013) assessed trait differences between streams with different types of long-term \n\naquatic regimes, but all within the Mediterranean climate area. Despite the recognition of the \n\nimportance of traits to predict community composition in phytoplankton ecology (Litchman \n\nand Klausmeier, 2008), interest in trait approaches applied to benthic diatoms is relatively \n\nrecent (Passy, 2007; Stevenson et al., 2008; Berthon et al., 2011; Rimet and Bouchez, 2011) \n\nand linked to changes caused by the degradation of stream quality, such as altered nutrient \n\nlevels, current velocity and sediment regimes (Passy, 2007; Stevenson et al., 2008; Berthon et \n\nal., 2011; Rimet and Bouchez, 2011). \n\nIn this study, the biological traits of both diatom and macroinvertebrate communities \n\nwere used to test the hypotheses that a severe drought event, with the complete drying of the \n\nstream channel, leads the aquatic communities in the Atlantic-temperate streams to: (1) react \n\nto stress by changing their traits and consequently, the traits that confer them an advantage \n\nduring drought are found in higher proportions, whereas those that constitute a disadvantage \n\nduring drought are found in lower proportions; and (2) shift trait composition to become \n\nmore similar to communities found in the Mediterranean streams. Moreover, we test the \n\nhypothesis (3) that hydric stress and posterior recovery of primary producers with short life \n\ncycles (diatoms) will be faster in comparison to consumers with longer life cycles \n\n(macroinvertebrates). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n92 \n\n4.2 Material and methods \n\n4.2.1 Study sites \n\nFour small perennial lowland streams, located in the central region of Portugal were \n\nsampled between 2011 and 2012: Ribeira de Boialvo (Tb), Rio da Serra (Ts), Ribeira de An\u00e7a \n\n(Ta) and Rio Alcoa (Tl), which are located in Vouga, Mondego and Ribeiras do Oeste \n\ncatchments (Figure 4.1). These catchments are within an Atlantic-temperate climate area \n\ncharacterised by mild temperatures, moderate summers and winters, and total annual \n\nprecipitation above 2,800 mm\u00b7year-1 (Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2007). A similar \n\ngeology characterised by flatlands of sedimentary origin (as limestone and sand) can be \n\nfound throughout the study area. \n\nFor comparative purposes, four small streams located in a Mediterranean climate area \n\nwere also selected for this study. Diatom and macroinvertebrate communities of those \n\nMediterranean streams were collected in spring 2004 following the same procedures \n\ndescribed for temperate streams. The sampling sites are located in the streams Ribeira do \n\nVidig\u00e3o (Mv), Ribeira de Oeiras (Mo), Ribeira de Gr\u00e2ndola (Mg) and Ribeira da Capelinha \n\n(Mc), which belong to the Guadiana, Sado and Mira catchments (Figure 4.1). These temporary \n\nstreams are located in southern Portugal where the climate is typically Mediterranean, with \n\nmild wet winters and hot dry summers, and a mean annual precipitation below 600mm year-1 \n\n(Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2007).  \n\nThe Mediterranean streams were selected with the aim of having geomorphic and \n\nanthropogenic pollution characteristics similar to each other and to the Atlantic-temperate \n\nstreams. Therefore, the main difference between the Atlantic-temperate and Mediterranean \n\nstreams (hereinafter referred as T and M) is the climate and, consequently, their natural long-\n\nterm hydrological regime (perennial and temporary). \n\n4.2.2 Climate characterisation of the study period in the Atlantic-temperate area \n\nShifts in flow regime and groundwater recharge are determined by changes in \n\ntemperature, evaporation and precipitation (Chiew, 2006; IPCC, 2012). Atlantic-temperate \n\nstreams are small lowland water courses and therefore changes in precipitation are rapidly \n\nreflected in stream water flow. Mean monthly precipitation in the temperate and \n\nMediterranean streams was obtained using gridded data from a dense network of gauge \n\nstations distributed across the study areas (IPMA, I.P.; http://www.ipma.pt; Belo-Pereira et \n\nal., 2011). The high summer (July, August September) temperatures of 2011 (average ~20 \u00b0C) \n\nassociated with the low precipitation values during the same period led to the complete \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n93 \n\ndrying of some stream channels in a typical Atlantic-temperate area (Figure 4.2a). These low \n\nvalues, similar to those recorded in the summer in the Mediterranean area (Figure 4.2b), \n\nremained during autumn (October, November and December) and winter (January, February \n\nand March). Only the rainy period recorded in November led to a resumption of flow in the \n\ntemperate streams (Figure 4.2a). \n\n \nFigure 4.1 - Location of the study sites in continental Portugal in the Atlantic-temperate climate (black \n\ntriangles) and in the Mediterranean climate (black circles). \n\n4.2.3 Sample collection and processing \n\nThe temperate (T) streams were sampled on three occasions: spring 2011 (T1), before \n\nthe severe and uncharacteristic drought event; autumn 2011 (TAD), 2 weeks after the return \n\nof water to the stream channel; and spring 2012 (T2) after the drought period when normal \n\nflow conditions were re-established (Figure 4.2a). Hereafter, the use of the term \u2018drought\u2019 \n\nrefers to the event that caused the complete drying of the streambeds. Sampling for biological \n\ncommunities was always performed when the streams had visible flowing water. \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n94 \n\n \nFigure 4.2 - Mean precipitation of the (a) Atlantic-temperate climate and (b) Mediterranean climate \n\nsites recorded during the study. Sampling occasions: T1, temperate spring before drought; TAD, \n\ntemperate first sample after water return; T2, temperate spring after drought. Data from the \n\nPortuguese Institute of Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA, I.P.; http://www.ipma.pt). \n\nSampling and treatment of diatoms was performed according to the European standards \n\n(European Committee for Standardisation, 2003, 2004, 2006). In each site, hard substrate \n\n(rocks or stones) was sampled when present; otherwise, sediment was sampled. Sampling of \n\nsediment instead of hard substrate was acceptable in light of a study by Mendes et al. (2012), \n\nwhich validated the use of alternative substrates. For the epilithic biofilm, five random \n\nsubmerged stones (an area of ~100 cm2) were collected and gently washed with running \n\nwater. The upper surface was then scraped with a toothbrush. For the epipsammon biofilm \n\n(site Ta), a volume of ~ 50 mL of the upper surface of the streambed sediment was collected \n\nusing a syringe. Samples were preserved with formaldehyde (4%). In order to ensure \n\necological reliability of the samples, the proportion of living and dead cells was verified under \n\na light microscope. The samples were then oxidised with concentrated nitric acid and \n\npotassium dichromate for 24 hours. Thereafter, permanent slides were mounted using \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n95 \n\nNaphrax\u00ae (Brunel Microscopes Ltd, Chippenham, UK). Using a light microscope (100x \n\nobjective and 1.32 numerical aperture), ~400 diatom valves for each sample were counted \n\nand identified to species or infrapecific rank mainly using the floras of Krammer and Lange-\n\nBertalot\u2019s (1986, 1988, 1991a, 1991b) and Krammer (2000, 2001, 2009). \n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates were sampled following a multihabitat approach according \n\nto the procedures described by the Portuguese Water Institute (INAG I.P.; INAG, 2008). \n\nBriefly, each sample was collected by kicking and sweeping approximately 1 m towards \n\nupstream with a hand-net (500 ?m mesh size; 0.25\u00d70.25 m width) and composed of six \n\ncomposite subsamples corresponding to the most representative habitats (e.g., stones, sand, \n\nsubmerged macrophytes). Macroinvertebrate samples were preserved in formaldehyde (4%) \n\nand, after sorting, preserved in ethanol (75%) for later identification and counting. \n\nTaxonomic identification, under a stereomicroscope (magnification 60x), was mostly done to \n\ngenus level with the exception of Chironomidae (subfamily or tribe level). \n\n4.2.4 Biological traits \n\nFor this study, we selected diatom and macroinvertebrate biological traits that we \n\npredicted would be affected (positively or negatively) by drought. For diatom communities, \n\ntwo biological traits were selected (Table 4.1): life form and biovolume. Within the life-form \n\ntrait, four categories were considered: mobile, colonial, tube-forming and stalked. The taxa \n\nwith mobility have the physical ability to select the most suitable habitat. The colonial taxa \n\nare in permanent contact with each other and therefore are more capable of surviving with \n\nless moisture due to interstitial spaces between the individual cells. The tube-forming life-\n\nform is a kind of colonial life-form; however, the diatoms live in a mucilaginous protective \n\ncase within which they are able to move freely (Berthon et al., 2011; Rimet and Bouchez, \n\n2011, 2012). The stalked taxa have the physical ability to be fixed to the substrate through \n\nmucilage stalks, which exposes them more to desiccation. Within the life-form trait, one taxon \n\ncan be assigned to more than one category. The second trait selected was biovolume, with the \n\ncategories: small species (5-299 \u00b5m3) and large species (?1500 \u00b5m3). Intermediate \n\nbiovolume categories were neglected, as we considered that differences caused by the \n\ndrought would be more evident in small and large species. The higher the differences in the \n\nsurface-to-volume ratio of the cells, the larger the differences found in the trait proportions of \n\nthese two categories. The biovolume categories were adapted from a study carried out by \n\nBerthon et al. (2011), and the values used were those found in the OMNDIA software (version \n\n5.3) (Lecointe et al., 1993). We predicted that the categories that confer higher resistance or \n\nresilience (e.g., mobile, colonial, tube forming and small size) would be favoured by the \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n96 \n\ndrought event (Table 4.1). The trait categories that confer lower resistance or resilience (e.g., \n\nstalked and large species) would be disadvantaged by the drought (Table 4.1). \n\nTable 4.1 - Predictions and justification for expected behaviour of diatom trait categories in response \n\nto an extreme drought event in temperate rivers. Arrows indicate changes in category proportion \n\nexpected in the temperate samples after drought (TAD and T2) compared with temperate samples \n\nbefore drought (T1) (up arrow, higher proportion; down arrow, lower proportion). \n\nTrait Category  Justification \n\nLife form \n\nMobile  ? \nPhysical capacity to move to the most suitable habitat \n\n(refuge use and recolonisation). \n\nColonial ? \nBetter resistance capacity, higher capacity to live with less \nmoisture due to interstitial spaces between the individual \n\ncells. \n\nTube forming ? \nPhysical capacity to produce a mucilaginous protective \n\nsubstance that confers higher resistance to drought.  \n\nStalked ? \nHigher cell surface exposed to physical alterations of the \n\nhabitat induced by the drought (desiccation). \n\nBiovolume \n\n5-299 \u00b5m3 \n(small \n\nspecies) \n? \n\nBetter resilience capacity and higher capacity to live with \nless moisture. Small species have large local population \n\ndensity, that prevents extinction. \n\n? 1500 \u00b5m3 \n(large species) \n\n? \nHigher cell surface exposed reduces their capacity to live \n\nwith less moisture. \n\n \n\nFor macroinvertebrate communities, seven biological traits were considered here to be \n\nmore affected by the drought (Table 4.2): maximum body size, life cycle duration, \n\nreproductive cycles per year, dispersal, locomotion, respiration and resistance forms. Within \n\neach trait, several categories were also considered, as shown in Table 4.2. Our predictions for \n\nthe selected trait categories responses were based on the hypothesis that the categories \n\nallowing resilience to disturbances with rapid population growth (e.g., small body size, short \n\nlife cycles, fast reproductive cycles), behavioural and physiological adaptations to escape and \n\navoid desiccation (e.g., aerial dispersal, aerial respiration, resistance forms against \n\ndesiccation) would be favoured by the drought event (Bonada et al, 2007a; Dol\u00e9dec and \n\nStatzner, 2008; Feio and Dol\u00e9dec, 2012; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., 2013). Trait information was \n\nderived according to the available biological information databases described in Tachet et al. \n\n(2002), for macroinvertebrate genera (and Diptera at family or subfamily level). Only the \n\ntrait categories with a high affinity (affinity 3 or above, using a fuzzy coding approach, \n\nChevenet et al. 1994) for a given category were considered in order to match the approach \n\nused for diatoms, for which affinity scores are not available. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n97 \n\nTable 4.2 - Predictions and justification for expected behaviour of macroinvertebrate trait categories in \n\nresponse to an extreme drought event in temperate rivers.

For both groups of organisms, taxa present \n\nin only one sample were not considered. Using this approach, we reduced the effect of errors \n\nin identification, sample contamination and avoided the effect of very rare taxa that could \n\ncreate a confounding effect in our analyses while preventing the observation of clear \n\nmultivariate patterns. Abundance data were fourth-root-transformed to down-weight the \n\ncontributions of abundant taxa (Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., 2011). For diatoms, this transformation \n\ngives more weight to large species that are often found at low relative abundances in benthic \n\ndiatom communities, and which can be important for defining diatom assemblages (ter Braak \n\nand Verdonschot, 1995; Tison et al., 2005). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n98 \n\nThe taxa that contributed the most to the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (up to 80% \n\ncumulative contribution) between T1 and TAD, and between T1 and T2, were determined \n\nthrough SIMPER analysis (PRIMER 6 and PERMANOVA+) for both diatom and \n\nmacroinvertebrate communities. All of the taxa obtained from SIMPER analysis were then \n\nassigned to the different trait categories. The relative abundance of each taxon was added to \n\nobtain the total proportion for each trait category on each sampling occasion (T1, TAD, T2 \n\nand M). The relative abundance of each taxon was always added in total to the trait categories \n\nthat it was assigned to. \n\nIn order to assess differences in groups of samples (T1, TAD, M and T1, T2, M) \n\nconcerning trait proportions, Multidimensional Scaling Analyses (MDS) were run separately \n\nfor diatoms and macroinvertebrates, based on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix (PRIMER 6 and \n\nPERMANOVA+; data arcsine square root transformed). Statistical differences between the \n\ngroups of samples (T1, TAD, T2 and M) were tested with a PERMANOVA pairwise test with \n\nunrestricted permutations (PRIMER 6 and PERMANOVA+) for diatoms and \n\nmacroinvertebrates. \n\nTo test our predictions and determine the traits responsible for the differences in \n\ncommunities between the initial status (temperate samples before drought-T1) and after \n\ndrought (T2 and TAD) two Canonical Analyses of Principal Coordinates (CAP) were run for \n\ndiatoms and for macroinvertebrates. In addition, to determine the traits responsible for \n\npossible differences between the communities in the temperate and Mediterranean streams, \n\nwe ran two CAP analyses between temperate samples before drought (T1) and \n\nMediterranean (M) samples for both macroinvertebrates and diatoms. The CAP provides a \n\nconstrained ordination diagram by finding the axis (or axes) in the principal coordinate space \n\nthat is best for discriminating between the a priori groups. Finally, overlaying vectors were \n\nadded to the CAP ordination showing which traits had the highest correlations with the CAP \n\naxes (Pearson correlation > 0.5). The PCA analyses were performed with the PRIMER 6 and \n\nPERMANOVA+ software. \n\nFor each individual trait category, two one-way ANOVA tests (SigmaPlot 12.0 software; \n\ndata arcsine square-root-transformed) were carried out to verify statistical significant \n\ndifferences between groups (T1, TAD, M and T1, T2, M). When normality tests and equal \n\nvariance tests failed, Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way ANOVA tests (ANOVA on ranks) were used. \n\nANOVAs were followed by pairwise comparisons (Tukey\u00b4s test) to assess which groups of \n\nsamples were different. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n99 \n\n4.3 Results \n\n4.3.1 Trait patterns of diatom communities \n\nEffects immediately after the drought \n\nThe MDS performed with the diatom trait proportions revealed a segregation of the \n\ndiatom communities in the Mediterranean streams from those in the temperate streams (T1-\n\nbefore the drought and TAD-2 weeks after the return of water) (Figure 4.3a). However, there \n\nwas a higher similarity of the Mediterranean (M) communities to those immediately after \n\ndrought (Bray-Curtis similarity, TAD-M=64% vs. T1-M=60%). In fact, the PERMANOVA \n\npairwise test indicated that there were significant differences only between T1 and \n\nMediterranean samples (T1-M: t=4.496, p<0.050). \n\nThrough the CAP, we verified that species with the trait categories \u2018stalked\u2019, \u2018mobile\u2019, \n\n\u2018colonial\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019 were those contributing more to the segregation between T1 and TAD \n\n(Figure 4.4a). These species were negatively affected (decreased in abundance) by the \n\ndrought. Nevertheless, from these trait categories, only the stalked species were significantly \n\ndifferent between T1 and TAD. The remaining trait categories only presented statistical \n\ndifferences between temperate and Mediterranean communities (Table 4.3). In general, the \n\ntemperate streams recorded higher proportions of mobile and small species and lower \n\nproportions of large species (Table 4.3). \n\nTable 4.3 - Results of the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, F) and ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis test, H) carried out for the different diatom biological trait categories of communities T1 \n\n(temperate spring before drought), TAD (first sample after water return) and M (Mediterranean).

This increase in the similarity between the \n\ntemperate samples (T1-TAD=79% vs. T1-T2=84%, Bray-Curtis similarity) suggested a \n\nrecovery of diatom communities.

Therefore, despite the similarity between T2 and M (63%, Bray-Curtis similarity) \n\nbeing comparable to the one recorded immediately after drought (TAD-M=64%), the spring \n\ncommunities affected by the drought (T2) were already different from the M communities. \n\nFrom TAD to T2, we verified that the temperate communities shifted from being more similar \n\nto M to becoming similar to T1.  \n\nSimilar to the MDS (Figure 4.3b), the CAP analyses also showed a smaller distinction \n\nbetween the temperate spring groups (T1 and T2) in comparison with T1 and TAD (Figure \n\n4.4a, b). No trait category was significantly different among the communities from these \n\ngroups of samples (T1 and T2) (Table 4.4). Statistical differences were present only between \n\nthe temperate and Mediterranean communities (Table 4.4). In fact, a CAP analysis performed \n\non the T1 and M samples revealed that there were trait categories with a higher contribution \n\nfor the differences between the Mediterranean and temperate streams (Figure 4.4c). The \n\nMediterranean communities appeared to be related to higher proportions of larger species \n\nand the temperate communities were related to higher proportions of smaller, mobile and \n\nstalked species (Table 4.4). \n\nTable 4.4 - Results of the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, F) and ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis test, H) carried out for the different diatom biological trait categories of communities T1 \n\n(temperate spring before drought), T2 (temperate spring after drought) and M(Mediterranean).

This segregation was statistically \n\nconfirmed by the PERMANOVA pairwise test results (T1-TAD, t=2.047, p<0.050; T1-M, \n\nt=1.543, p<0.050; TAD-M, t=2.116, p<0.050). However, TAD samples appeared more \n\nseparated and presented a lower similarity with the remaining groups of samples (T1-\n\nTAD=56%; TAD-M=64%, Bray-Curtis similarity). In fact, TAD similarities were even lower \n\nthan the similarity found between T1 and M (73%). The proportions of some traits in the \n\nafter drought communities (TAD) were affected by the drought, but did not shift towards the \n\nMediterranean communities (Figure 4.5a; Table 4.5). \n\nSeveral traits contributed to the differences found in the temperate communities after \n\ndrought (Figure 4.6a). There was a decrease in swimmers, animals with shorter life cycles, \n\naerial active and aquatic passive dispersion or cocoons as a resistance form and an increase \n\nin animals with extreme sizes (small (<5mm) and large animals (20-80 mm)) and animals \n\nbreathing though gills. However, from these traits, only the proportion of swimmers, cocoons \n\nas a resistance form, aerial active and aquatic passive dispersion were significantly lower \n\nafter the drought (Table 4.5).  \n\nTable 4.5 - Results of the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, F) and ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis test, H) carried out for the different macroinvertebrate trait categories of communities T1 \n\n(temperate spring before drought), TAD (temperate first sample after water return and M \n\n(Mediterranean).

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n106 \n\nEffects over 1 year \n\nThe comparison of the proportions of macroinvertebrate trait categories found in T1, T2 \n\nand M communities revealed a change in the T2 communities towards the initial T1 state \n\n(Figure 4.5b). The Bray-Curtis similarity between T1 and T2 (65%) was higher than the \n\nsimilarity between T1 and TAD (56%). The spring samples affected by the drought (T2) also \n\nbecame more similar to the Mediterranean samples (75%). In fact, there were statistical \n\ndifferences only between T1 and M (PERMANOVA pairwise test: t=1.577, p<0.050). \n\nDespite the shift of T2 communities to the initial state, there were some traits \n\ncontributing to the segregation between T1 and T2 (Figure 4.6b). From the trait categories \n\naffected by the drought in TAD, only the aquatic passive trait was able to recover in T2 to \n\nproportions similar to T1 (Table 4.6). The species with the traits \u2018aerial active\u2019, \u2018swimmers\u2019 \n\nand \u2018animals with cocoons\u2019 still presented a significantly lower proportion in T2 than before \n\nthe drought. However, despite the absence of statistical differences within trait categories, it \n\nwas possible to verify some changes over time. For example, concerning the trait \u2018small \n\nmaximum body size\u2019 (<5mm), we verified that there was a tendency for the trait proportion \n\nfrom TAD to T2 to become similar to T1 (Figure 4.6a, b).  \n\nThe CAP contrasting temperate and Mediterranean samples (Figure 4.6c) showed more \n\nsimilarities within Mediterranean samples than within temperate samples of the first spring \n\n(T1). The Mediterranean streams had higher proportions of species with no resistance form, \n\nshorter life cycles and small sizes, and a reduced proportion in swimmers, animals with \n\naquatic passive dispersion, crawlers, animals breathing with gills, larger animals and cocoons \n\nas resistance form. However, individually, we found significant differences only between T1 \n\nand M in one trait category (large body size) (Table 4.6). \n\nTable 4.6 - Results of the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, F) and ANOVA on ranks (Kruskal\u2013\n\nWallis test, H) carried out for the different macroinvertebrate trait categories of communities T1 \n\n(temperate spring before drought), T2 (temperate spring after drought and M (Mediterranean).

This uncharacteristic event led to changes in the trait \n\nproportions of the diatom and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities of these streams for \n\nat least a 6-month period. However, diatoms and macroinvertebrates had different responses \n\nto the drought. In accordance with the second hypothesis, the drought led to a shift in the \n\ndiatom trait proportions towards proportions similar to those found in Mediterranean \n\ncommunities. However, shortly after the return of water to the channel (TAD) most of the \n\ncommunities\u2019 traits did not present significant differences with the temperate communities \n\nbefore the drought (T1). In fact, the diatom communities from temporary rivers are known \n\nfor their ability to rapidly recolonise a dry river after the water return (Robson et al., 2008). \n\nIn spite of that, the temperate communities still presented some differences in the following \n\nspring (T2) as some traits did not return to their predrought proportions (i.e., \u2018colonial\u2019 and \n\n\u2018stalked\u2019) (Figure 4.7). This may reveal more long-lasting changes resulting from the drought \n\nbut also natural inter-annual variability. \n\n \nFigure 4.7 - Mean relative abundance of diatom (bold underlined) and macroinvertebrate traits found \n\nin the three groups of samples: black triangle, temperate spring before drought (T1); white circles, first \n\ntemperate sample after water return (TAD); white triangle, temperate spring after drought (T2). \n\nLogarithmic scale. \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n108 \n\nCommunity attributes for macroinvertebrates just after rewetting were very different \n\nfrom those found in the spring of 2011. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the postdrought \n\ncommunities were different from the Mediterranean ones. This difference could be partially \n\ndue to natural seasonal patterns of macroinvertebrates (autumn and spring); however, \n\nprevious studies have already demonstrated the seasonal stability of biological traits in \n\naquatic communities (B\u00eache et al., 2006). Differences are most probably associated with the \n\ndrought event itself. Immediately after a stress condition (i.e., drought), it is expected that \n\nonly the organisms with traits that are able to pass the strong abiotic filters imposed by this \n\nstress will be found in the streams (Poff, 1997; B\u00eache et al., 2006). Indeed, there was a \n\nsignificant decrease in the proportions of some trait categories with the drought event: \u2018aerial \n\nactive\u2019 and \u2018aquatic passive dispersion\u2019, and \u2018swimmers\u2019 and \u2018cocoons as a resistance form\u2019 for \n\nmacroinvertebrates. However, no trait category disappeared. The trait \u2018swimmer\u2019 was the \n\nonly one for which statistical differences were observed between the temperate-after-\n\ndrought and Mediterranean communities. However, this trait proportion was not statistically \n\ndifferent from the Mediterranean and predrought communities.  \n\nDespite the confirmation of our first hypothesis, the predictions for the different diatom \n\nand macroinvertebrate trait categories were not always confirmed. We expected that a \n\ndrought event, with flow cessation, would be sufficient for the trait proportions of the \n\ncommunities to change from being adapted to the temperate stream conditions and becoming \n\ncloser to Mediterranean stream conditions where communities are adapted to droughts; \n\nhowever, that did not occur. We had predicted that the postdrought (both TAD and T2) and \n\nMediterranean samples would have a higher proportion of colonial diatom species. The \n\ncomplex architecture of the colonies (Snoeijs et al., 2002) would allow them a better \n\nresistance capacity to the drought. Also, Passy (2002) suggested that increased \n\nmorphological complexity in colonial diatoms is a possible evolutionary strategy for survival \n\nin unpredictable environments. However, we found colonial diatom species such as Fragilaria \n\nvaucheriae (K\u00fctzing) J. B. Petersen, Fragilaria capucina Desmazi\u00e8res and Melosira varians C. \n\nAgardh in all temperate samples, and in none of the Mediterranean samples. This may have \n\noccurred because the colonies from loosely attached mats, which are particularly vulnerable \n\nto disturbance (e.g., floods) and may lack traits that enable the retention of interstitial space \n\n(Ledger et al., 2008). Therefore, colonial species may have reached high proportions early in \n\nthe colonisation process after the drought event, but were rapidly replaced by other more \n\ncompetitive species. Therefore, these were not highly represented in the sampled TAD, T2 \n\nand M communities. \n\nThe diatom species with the ability to move (\u2018mobile\u2019 category) have the advantage of \n\nbeing able to select the most suitable habitat (Passy, 2007), finding refuges and thus a faster \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n109 \n\nrecolonising capacity when the basal flow conditions are re-established. Therefore, we \n\nexpected that species with this trait category would be present in higher proportions in the \n\nafter drought (TAD and T2) and Mediterranean samples as they would be among the first \n\ncolonisers. However, our predictions were not supported; in fact, the drought appears to have \n\nnegatively affected the mobile taxa, and samples from the temperate streams (more stable) \n\ntend to have a higher proportion of mobile species than the Mediterranean streams (more \n\nunstable). This may be explained by the inability of such taxa to resist to the dislodgement by \n\nshear stress imposed by the elevated water currents (Peterson, 1996) of the seasonal events \n\nof flooding that are also typical in Mediterranean streams. \n\nA previous study (Virtanen et al., 2011) indicated that diatom taxa with attachment \n\ncapability (\u2018stalk\u2019 category) can resist the water current effects. Here, we predicted that this \n\nresistance capacity would be a disadvantage following a drought event due to their inability \n\nto seek protection from desiccation. Indeed, this prediction was confirmed as there was a \n\nstatistically significant reduction of this trait after the drought (TAD). However, in the \n\nMediterranean streams, this trait was found in lower proportions (even though not \n\nsignificantly different from the temperate streams), which may indicate that this is not a \n\nrelevant adaptation in such systems. We predicted that diatoms with the tube-forming trait \n\ncategory would be able to overcome the cessation of water. The relative abundances of the \n\ntaxa with this trait category were always very low in the temperate streams (T1 and TAD), \n\nand in temperate stream (T2) and Mediterranean streams, these taxa were not present at all. \n\nThis suggests that our prediction for the trait category \u2018tube forming\u2019 was probably incorrect, \n\nas streams typically affected by droughts (Mediterranean streams) did not record taxa with \n\nthis trait. \n\nThe ability of macroinvertebrates to disperse actively by flight was predicted to be an \n\nadvantage in drought disturbance situations. Individuals with the ability to fly would be able \n\nto depart with the drying of the streambed in order to find a suitable habitat, and would \n\nconsequently be the first colonisers after the water return (e.g., Gasith and Resh, 1999). In \n\nfact, the decrease in those animals after the drought may have been due to an active escape to \n\nmore suitable conditions. However, there was no return of macroinvertebrates with this trait \n\nduring the study. Another hypothesis is that the macroinvertebrates with aerial dispersion in \n\nfact disappeared, as the aerial stage phase was not synchronised with the unpredicted \n\ndrought period. In this case, it is very difficult to test these predictions without evaluating the \n\nphenomenon itself during its occurrence and assessing a larger area surrounding the stream \n\nthrough the capture of flying adults. Regarding aquatic passive dispersion and swimming \n\nlocomotion, we also confirmed our predictions (Figure 4.7). The proportions of these trait \n\ncategories were negatively affected by the drought as \u2018drift\u2019 or \u2018swim\u2019 became impracticable \n\nwith the restricted flow and persistence of the dry bed that acted as a barrier. However, what \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n110 \n\nwe did not expect was that the proportions of taxa with swimming locomotion after drought \n\nwould be different from those found in the Mediterranean streams. In fact, Garc\u00eda-Roger et al. \n\n(2013) also verified positive associations between the trait categories \u2018aquatic passive\u2019 and \n\nfull water \u2018swimmers\u2019 with permanent Mediterranean climate streams and non-significant \n\nassociation with intermittent streams with summer dry channels. Additionally, Bonada et al. \n\n(2007b) verified that, in intermittent sites, the organisms were mostly fliers and surface \n\nswimmers. For the trait \u2018cocoons\u2019 as a resistance form we verified an unexpected decrease in \n\ntemperate communities after the drought. It was expected that in a stable environment, such \n\nas perennial streams, the production of drought-resistant forms would be unnecessary in \n\ncomparison with an unstable one, such as temporary streams (Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., 2013). This \n\ncontradiction could again be due to the unpredictability of the drought against the adaptation \n\nof communities to predictable changes in flow in Mediterranean streams. However, caution \n\nshould be applied in the interpretation of the trait category \u2018cocoons\u2019 as a resistance form, as \n\nthe taxon Baetis was the only one contributing to this trait category. Higher proportions were \n\nfound in T1 samples than in those from after the drought (TAD and T2) and also in \n\nMediterranean samples (M). In fact, these higher proportions of Baetis in the predrought \n\ntemperate streams are in agreement with the results obtained by Garc\u00eda-Roger et al. (2011), \n\nwho found that the family Baetidae was characteristic of perennial streams and also \n\nindicative of the riffle mesohabitat of Mediterranean streams.  \n\nFor both elements of body size category, our predictions were not statistically \n\nconfirmed. According to Virtanen et al. (2011) there are several mechanisms through which \n\nbody size and temporal occurrence may be interrelated: (1) the short life cycles and fast \n\nreproduction for small organisms may increase their probability to occur at a site because of \n\nlow extinction risk; (2) small-bodied organisms have the ability to disperse efficiently to \n\nanother site; (3) small organisms have very large local population density, which prevents \n\nextinctions; and (4) the smaller the body size, the more susceptible the species is to \n\nenvironmental physical changes. However, contrary to our prediction, the small diatom \n\nspecies appeared to be more associated with typically more stable environments (T1). This is \n\nmore evident when we look to the Mediterranean communities. These communities had \n\nsignificantly lower proportions of small diatom species and higher proportions of large \n\nspecies. Therefore, the physical variability (unstable environments) of Mediterranean \n\nstreams appeared to favour larger diatoms. In contrast, higher proportions of small \n\nmacroinvertebrates appeared more associated with the hydrologically unstable \n\nMediterranean streams. This result is in accordance with the findings of other authors who \n\nstated that small sizes are favoured in more unstable environments (Dol\u00e9dec and Statzner, \n\n2008; Feio and Dol\u00e9dec, 2012; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., 2013). Significant differences in the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n111 \n\nproportions of macroinvertebrate sizes in temperate streams following the drought event \n\nwere not evident. However, there was a tendency for the after-drought samples (TAD) to be \n\nmore highly correlated with both small and large macroinvertebrates. In the samples \n\ncollected in the spring affected by the drought (T2), this correlation was no longer so evident, \n\nsuggesting a recovery of the temperate streams with respect to macroinvertebrate sizes. \n\nMore reproduction cycles per unit of time are necessary to mitigate extreme disturbance \n\neffects in the resistance of the community (Dol\u00e9dec and Statzner, 2008). In agreement with \n\nthis, individuals that reproduce more slowly (<1 year-1) were disadvantaged by the drought. \n\nTherefore, they were less abundant after rewetting, but the differences were not significant.  \n\nRegarding the respiration trait, none of our predictions were confirmed. However, for \n\nthe trait category \u2018gills\u2019, we found a higher correlation of this trait with some of the after-\n\ndrought samples (TAD). The drought seems to have caused an increase in the proportions of \n\nanimals breathing by gills in some of the sites. In contrast, the results obtained by Garc\u00eda-\n\nRoger et al. (2013), carried out only in Mediterranean climate streams, indicate a positive \n\ncorrelation of this trait category but only with permanent streams. Concerning the trait \n\n\u2018aerial respiration\u2019 there was an opposite tendency from that found in the trait \u2018gills\u2019. The \n\ntemperate after-drought samples (TAD) correlated less with this trait. As in other cases, this \n\nmay be related to a poor resistance to drought of other traits of these taxa, which led to its \n\ndisappearance, even though a certain trait (e.g., aerial respiration) would confer an \n\nadvantage. Also, the absence of statistically significant differences may be due to a high \n\nvariability within temperate sites. \n\nThe macroinvertebrates with the capacity to crawl were the ones present in higher \n\nproportions in all groups of samples (temperate and Mediterranean). We predicted that this \n\ntrait category would be favoured by the drought. However, our prediction was not confirmed, \n\nas the crawlers appeared more associated with the predrought temperate samples than with \n\nthe Mediterranean samples. This association of the macroinvertebrates with crawler \n\nlocomotion with temperate streams, rather than with Mediterranean ones, is in accordance \n\nwith the findings of Bonada et al. (2007a).  \n\nThe two biological elements of the study (diatoms and macroinvertebrates) appeared to \n\nhave different responses and recovery times to the drought event, confirming our third \n\nhypothesis. Both were affected by the same drought period, yet macroinvertebrate traits \n\nrecovered more slowly, suggesting that, at least partially, the ecosystem functioning was \n\naltered for a longer period. For example, primary production may have been restored rapidly \n\ndue to the absence of some grazers and scrapers that were not able to resist drought. \n\nTherefore, the lack of top-down control may have caused interference in transference of \n\nenergy and matter across the food chains. In the spring of 2012, some trait categories of the \n\nmacroinvertebrate communities still occurred in different proportions to those found in the \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n112 \n\nspring of 2011. Other studies showed that, globally, community post-recovery processes after \n\ndrought may last for over a few months or extend for much longer periods (e.g., Mosisch, \n\n2001; Death, 2008). However, despite the visibility of some drought effects, ~2 weeks after \n\nwater resumption (TAD), diatoms in the temperate rivers reached trait proportions close to \n\nthose of spring 2011. These results indicate the importance of the study of both communities \n\nfor a more accurate assessment of unexpected drought events, and, in order to detect \n\ndifferences in diatom communities, the sampling should occur less than two weeks after the \n\nrecovery of flow. \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nFurther research is needed to establish a more complete database on diatom traits to be \n\nused in similar studies, as information on these traits is scarce compared to those for \n\nmacroinvertebrates. Moreover, we conclude that traits that confer resistance to unexpected \n\nevents, such as drought, are not necessarily the same as those that characterise a typically \n\nunstable environment where droughts (and floods) are predictable. In these unstable \n\nenvironments, community traits are the result of a long evolutionary process towards \n\nadaptation. More studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind functional \n\nresponses of both microalgae and macroinvertebrates to extreme droughts. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nCAP Canonical Analyses of Principal Coordinates \n\nM Samples from Mediterranean streams \n\nMDS non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \n\nPCA Principal Components Analysis \n\nT1 Samples from Temperate streams collected in spring 2011, before the \n\nsevere and uncharacteristic drought event \n\nT2 Samples from Temperate streams collected in spring 2012, after the \n\ndrought period when normal flow conditions were re-established \n\nTAD Samples from Temperate streams in autumn 2011, 2 weeks after the return \n\nof water to the stream channel \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n113 \n\nAcknowledgement \n\nThis study was made owing to funding by the \u2018Foundation for Science and Technology\u2019, \n\nPortugal, through the AQUAWEB project (PTDC/AACAMB/105297/2008), national funds \n\nMEC, and the program POPH \u2013 QREN and the PhD scholarship SFRH/BD/68973/2010 to C.

Two weeks after dewatering, \n\nmacroinvertebrate metrics exhibited accentuated decreases in the total abundance, EPT taxa \n\nand the scores of the \u2018\u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados\u2019 but exhibited increases in \n\nequitability. The post-drought diatom assemblages showed no significant difference in \n\nabundance or evenness in relation to pre-drought conditions, but the diatom quality index \n\n(\u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019 - IPS) decreased. Four weeks after the drought, the \n\ninvertebrate communities progressively recovered, whereas the diatom metrics were already \n\nat pre-drought values, except for the IPS, which improved slowly over time. The benthic \n\ncommunities recovered faster in streams with higher Habitat Quality Assessment scores \n\n(HQA). The EPT taxa, Echinogammarus spp., Hydroporus spp. and Ancylus fluviatilis, did not \n\nrecover to pre-drought values, whereas Lumbricidae and Orthocladiinae increased. For \n\ndiatoms between the pre- and post-drought years, there was a shift from more sensitive to \n\nmore tolerant taxa (e.g., the disappearance of Cocconeis euglypta Ehrenberg and the \n\nappearance of Nitzschia palea (K\u00fctzing) W. Smith. This study showed that an extreme off-\n\nseason drought had immediate effects on both of the analysed benthic communities, but the \n\ndiatoms recovered faster. Over one year, none of the studied benthic communities returned \n\nto the same pre-drought conditions, but the differences were stronger for invertebrates. In \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n120 \n\nboth cases, the a priori habitat condition of streams appeared to control the reaction and \n\nrecovery patterns of the benthic communities to drought in the studied temperate streams. \n\nKeywords \n\nDiatoms, invertebrates, climate change, dewatering, precipitation \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n121 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nThe increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to \n\nanthropogenic activities have been causing climate change (Forster et al., 2007), which have \n\nglobal implications for all ecosystems. Sea levels are expected to continue rising as the snow \n\nand ice extent decrease (IPCC, 2012). In addition, precipitation amounts and patterns are \n\nchanging, and there are major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons (Arnell, 1999a, \n\nb). Climate change consequences, such as higher temperatures, more frequent floods and \n\ndrought, clearly need further attention from both scientists and managers (Bond et al., 2008).  \n\nFreshwater ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change (Schindler, 1997; \n\nHeino et al., 2009; Whitehead et al., 2009). Shifts in river flow regimes and groundwater \n\nrecharge are determined by changes in temperature, evaporation, and particularly \n\nprecipitation (Chiew, 2006; IPCC, 2012). Modifications in river runoff will decrease the \n\nrecharging of groundwater supplies (Mandal and Zhang, 2012; Thampi and Raneesh, 2012) \n\nand will be enhanced by increased evaporation rates. Moreover, this climatic alteration leads \n\nto an increase in extreme climate events such as floods and droughts which can be \n\nexacerbated by anthropogenic factors such as streambed alterations and deforestation (e.g., \n\nHauer et al., 1997). According to Christensen et al. (2007), diverse future climatic scenarios \n\nfor Europe predict an increase in annual mean temperatures (more than the global mean) \n\nand greater heterogeneity in precipitation patterns; e.g., in the increases in the annual \n\nprecipitation are forecasted for northern Europe, whereas decreases are forecasted for \n\nsouthern Europe and Mediterranean. In addition, seasonal precipitation is expected to \n\nincrease in winter and spring and decrease in summer and autumn (Johns et al., 2003; Giorgi \n\net al., 2004).  \n\nThe northern and central Portuguese coastline and adjacent regions have a temperate \n\nAtlantic climate with typically wet winters. Despite these climatic characteristics, the country \n\nexperienced a severe and uncharacteristic drought in the autumn/winter period of \n\n2011/2012. Throughout the territory, the total monthly precipitation observed in this period \n\nwas extremely low when compared with the same seasons from previous years. More \n\nparticularly, in central Portugal, the mean precipitation between October 2011 and March \n\n2012 was of 58.5 mm, compared to 126.6 mm for the same period between 1980 and 2013, \n\naccording the Portuguese National Information System of Hydric Resources (SNIRH at \n\nhttp://snirh.pt). In fact, February 2012 was the driest month since 1931, and the monthly \n\nprecipitation was only 3.3 mm, which largely contrasts with the 128.6 mm registered for the \n\nmonthly average in February of previous years (period of 1980 to 2013; SNIRH; \n\nhttp://snirh.pt). This absence of precipitation led to a severe dewatering drought event in \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n122 \n\nsome streams of the Portuguese Atlantic humid climate. The intermittence of flow is \n\ncharacteristic of Mediterranean streams where communities have adaptations for desiccation \n\n(Steinman and McIntire, 1990; Lake, 2003; Bonada et al., 2006) but constitutes an anomaly in \n\nAtlantic temperate areas, where streams are typically perennial.  \n\nIn previous studies, extreme droughts have caused sharp decreases in the total biomass \n\nof aquatic insects (e.g., Walters et al., 2011) and alterations in assemblages (e.g., Thomson et \n\nal., 2012), as well as triggered species loss and the collapse of food webs, with important \n\ndecreases in secondary production (Ledger et al., 2011). Indeed, rapid or unpredicted drying \n\ndoes not provide the necessary amount of time for development of desiccation-resistant \n\nstructures or physiological adjustments (Stanley et al., 2004). In this case, the ability of biota \n\nto recover from drought relies on the environment features (e.g., substratum type; Wright et \n\nal., 2003), availability of refugia (e.g., Gasith and Resh, 1999), intensity and/or duration of the \n\nhydrological event (e.g., Lake, 2003), and the taxonomic assemblage considered (e.g., Acu\u00f1a \n\net al., 2005; Ledger et al., 2008; Boinx et al., 2010). Primary producers with short life cycles, \n\nsuch as diatoms, usually recolonise faster after a disturbance when compared with secondary \n\nproducers (e.g., invertebrates) with longer life cycles (Gasith and Resh, 1999).  \n\nOther studies have addressed the impact of extreme climatic events such as droughts in \n\nshaping communities of freshwater systems under an intermittent hydrological regime (e.g., \n\nBond et al., 2008; Feio et al., 2010; Marchetti et al., 2011; Thomson et al., 2012). However, \n\nlittle is known about the effects of extreme and uncharacteristic off-season dewatering events \n\n(but see Caramujo et al., 2008) in the benthic communities of temperate streams.  \n\nThis study aims to analyse the effect of an unusual (seasonally and geographically) \n\nextreme dewatering drought event in Atlantic temperate streams by comparatively assessing \n\nthe recover responses of two distinct benthic communities (macroinvertebrates and diatoms) \n\nfrom the progression of dewatering to rewetting. \n\n5.2 Methods \n\n5.2.1 Study sites \n\nFive permanent streams were selected for this study, which are located near the coast of \n\ncentral Portugal (&lt;40 km from the Atlantic Ocean). This area has an Atlantic-humid \n\ntemperate climate, with a mean annual precipitation within the period of 1971\u20132000 ranging \n\nfrom 800 to 1200 mm (Belo-Pereira et al., 2011; IPMA, Portuguese Institute of the Sea and \n\nAtmosphere at http://www.ipma.pt). These streams have mild temperatures and moderate \n\nsummers and winters, and all five streams have similar environmental characteristics (size, \n\naltitude, geology). These streams, named Ribeira de Boialvo (Boialvo), Rio da Serra (Serra); \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n123 \n\nRibeira de Eiras (Eiras); Ribeira de An\u00e7a (An\u00e7a); and Nascente do Rio Alcoa (Alcoa), are \n\nlocated in Mondego, Vouga and Ribeiras do Oeste catchments in the centre of Portugal \n\n(Figure 5.1). This study region is dominated by flatlands with sedimentary rocks (limestone \n\nand sand). The altitude of the study sites is relatively low, ranging from 36 (An\u00e7a) to 111 \n\nmeters (Serra). The distance to source varied between 4.2 and 12.0 km. All sites are \n\ninfluenced by mild organic pollution, mainly derived from agriculture activities and housing.  \n\nIn mid-fall 2011 (late October), all stream sites were found completely dry (without any \n\nvisible water or remaining pools) because of an unusual climatological drought that occurred \n\nthroughout 2011. The mean average precipitation registered until October was lower than \n\nthe historical mean monthly precipitation for the period of 1980-2013, except for two \n\nmonths, May and August (Figure 5.2). In November 2011, a peak of precipitation occurred \n\nthat allowed a break in the dewatering period in the streams; however, the flow level was still \n\nlow. Afterwards, the recorded precipitation was still considered low in the following months \n\nin comparison to previous years (until March 2012; Figure 5.2), and the flow level was also \n\nlow. The total monthly precipitation between October 2011 and March 2012 was 50% lower \n\nthan the precipitation recorded in previous years for the same period (Figure 5.2). It was not \n\nuntil April/May 2012 that the streams appeared to recover to a typical average discharge for \n\nthat season (based on the observed mean precipitation, which was closer to the historical \n\nreference values for the same period). \n\n \nFigure 5.1 - Locations of the study stream sites in Portugal (black triangles) and the precipitation gauge \n\nstation (square) used in this study. \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Black arrows represent the sampling events, and the open arrow indicate the time when the \n\nstreams completely dried out. \n\n5.2.2 Sample collection and processing \n\nThe streams were first sampled in spring 2011 (Sample 1-s1; May). This sample was \n\nconsidered as the pre-drought condition, as the selected streams were not yet completely \n\ndewatered. The post-drought condition was assessed by four biweekly sampling events after \n\nrewetting during winter (between November 2011 and January 2012; Sample 2-s2, Sample 3-\n\ns3, Sample 4-s4, Sample 5-s5) and then again in spring 2012 (Sample 6-s6; May; Figure 5.2). \n\nSampling was only conducted when the streams had visible water in their streambeds. For \n\neach sampling event, measurements of pH, conductivity (\u00b5S\u00b7cm-1), total dissolved oxygen \n\n(DO; mg\u00b7L-1) and current velocity (m\u00b7s-1) were performed in situ using field meters \n\n(Multiparameter Probe 3430 WTW\u00ae; Current Meter 108MKIII VALEPORT). The water \n\nsamples were collected in spring 2011 and spring 2012 (s1 and s6) for laboratory \n\ndetermination of chemical oxygen demand (COD; mg\u00b7L-1), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5; \n\nmg\u00b7L), phosphates (PO43-; mg\u00b7L-1), total phosphorus (P; mg\u00b7L-1), total nitrogen (N; mg\u00b7L-1), \n\nnitrates (NO3-; mg\u00b7L-1) and alkalinity (CaCO3; mg\u00b7L-1). In addition, all stream sites were \n\ngeomorphologically characterized according to River Habitat Survey methodology (RHS - \n\nEnvironment Agency, 2003) to determine the Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) scores. The \n\nHQA index reflects the overall habitat diversity through the assessment of the flow-types, \n\ndiversity of channel substratum, in-channel vegetation, and the extent of bank-top trees and \n\nnear-natural land-use adjacent to the river. The final HQA score results from the sum of the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n125 \n\nindividual scores attributed to those features; a higher score indicates a site with better \n\nhabitat condition (36 is the Excellent-Good boundary for the HQA of littoral streams). \n\nMacroinvertebrates were sampled with a hand-net (500 ?m mesh size) by kicking and \n\nsweeping the benthos, following a multi-habitat approach described in INAG (2008). Each \n\nsample was composed of six sub-samples distributed proportionally to the most \n\nrepresentative habitats and defined by an area of 1 m \u00d7 0.25 m (hand net side). The samples \n\nwere preserved in formaldehyde (4%) and conserved in ethanol (90%) after sorting for \n\nfuture identification and counting. Taxonomic identification using a stereomicroscope was \n\ntypically performed to genus level; however, Chironomidae and Oligochaeta were identified \n\nto sub-family or tribe level.  \n\nThe diatoms were sampled and processed based on European standards (European \n\nCommittee for Standardisation, 2003, 2004, 2006) and on the recommendations of Kelly et al. \n\n(1998). Whenever stones (preferred sampled substrate) were absent or unavailable, stream \n\nsediment was sampled as a substitute. A previous study (Mendes et al., 2012) showed that \n\nalternative substrates can be used for water quality assessment in the absence of a certain \n\nsubstrate, disregarding substrate variability. The epilithic biofilm was scraped with a \n\ntoothbrush from the upper surface of submerged stones, comprising an area about 100 cm2. \n\nFor sampling epipsammon/epipelon, a syringe (50 mL) was used to collect streambed \n\nsediment. The samples were preserved with formaldehyde (4%) and oxidised using \n\nconcentrated nitric acid and potassium dichromate for approximately 24 hours for organic \n\nmatter digestion. The samples were mounted on permanent slides using Naphrax\u00ae. Under a \n\nlight microscope (100 \u00d7 objective and 1.32 numerical aperture), up to 400 diatom valves for \n\neach sample were counted and identified to species or infra-specific rank mainly using \n\nKrammer and Lange-Bertalot\u2019s floras (1986, 1988 and 1991a, b). \n\n5.2.3 Community analyses and biological metrics \n\nTo assess differences in the macroinvertebrate and diatom communities between the \n\ndifferent sampling events, non-parametric multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) were run \n\nfor each biological element based on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix. We used taxa \n\nabundances from sites in spring 2011 pre-drought (s1) and spring 2012 post-drought (s6; \n\ndiatom data transformed by fourth root). In addition, the ANOSIM global test (analysis of \n\nsimilarities; 126 permutations) was used to test for significant differences between the above \n\ngroups of samples for both biological elements. ANOSIM is a non-parametric randomization \n\nbased multivariate test analogous to a standard univariate ANOVA. \n\nTo determine the taxa contributing the most to the dissimilarity between pre-drought \n\n(May 2011: s1) and post drought conditions (May 2012: s6), a SIMPER analysis (with Bray-\n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n126 \n\nCurtis similarity) was used based on the total abundance of diatoms and invertebrates for all \n\nsites at corresponding sampling date. In addition, widely used metrics were applied to \n\nevaluate eventual responses to drought. The metric values were represented by the mean (\u00b1 \n\nstandard error; SE) from all sites at each sampling event. The differences between sampling \n\noccasions were tested for each metric by running PERMANOVA pairwise tests (permutational \n\nunivariate analysis of variance; based on Euclidean distance matrix; 999 permutations). \n\nFor macroinvertebrates, we used the following metrics: total number of individuals, \n\nrichness (number of taxa), Pielou\u2019s evenness, EPT taxa, Coleoptera and Diptera richness \n\n(number of Families) and the multimetric index IPtI (\u2018\u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados\u2019). The \n\nIPtI was expressed in an Ecological Quality Ratios (EQR), in which the values represent the \n\nrelation between the observed biological parameters in a river type and the expected for that \n\nsame river type in reference conditions, assigning a quality classification as High, Good, \n\nModerate, Poor and Bad, according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD; European \n\nCommission, 2000). For diatoms we used the following metrics: richness (number of taxa), \n\nShannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou\u2019s evenness and the IPS index (\u2018Indice de \n\nPolluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019; Cemagref, 1982) expressed in EQR.  \n\nFor the macroinvertebrates, the metrics and indices were determined using the Amiib@ \n\nsoftware (http://dqa.inag.pt/documenacaoficial_PORTUGAL_invertebradosbentonicos.html) \n\ndeveloped by Instituto da \u00c1gua, I.P., whereas the OMNIDIA software v. 5.3 (Lecointe et al., \n\n1993) was used for the diatoms. All statistical tests were performed using PRIMER 6 &amp; \n\nPERMANOVA+. \n\n5.3 Results \n\n5.3.1 Abiotic characterisation of the sites \n\nThe physical and chemical parameters recorded in the streams studied confirmed that \n\nthey were all affected by mild organic pollution. The COD values ranged from 2.1 mg/L to 9.8 \n\nmg/L, and phosphates values ranged from 0.25 and 0.97 mg PO43-\u00b7L-1 (Table 5.1). The HQA \n\nscores varied from 22 to 42, indicating that the Eiras and Alcoa streams had a low habitat \n\nquality (lowest scores), whereas the Serra and Boialvo had a high (highest scores), thus \n\nrevealing an excellent classification according to the Portuguese limits established for the \n\ntypes of rivers under study (INAG, 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n127 \n\nTable 5.1 - Mean values (\u00b1 standard error) of the measured and calculated variables for each study site. \n\nParameters \nRibeira de \n\nBoialvo (B) \n\nRibeira de \n\nEiras (E) \n\nRio da Serra (S) Nascente do \n\nRio Alcoa (Al) \n\nRibeira de \n\nAn\u00e7a (An) \n\nLatitude (y) 40.5844 40.254 40.4124 39.5366 40.2675 \n\nLongitude (x) -8.3358 -8.4238 -8.3486 -8.9457 -8.5153 \n\nDistance to source (km) 7.1 6.8 6.9 13 12 \n\nAltitude (m) 44 38 111 44 36 \n\nCurrent velocity (m\u00b7s-1)a 0.38 (\u00b10.09) 0.41 (\u00b10.15) 0.76 (\u00b10.20) 0.78 (\u00b10.16) 0.04 (\u00b10.02) \n\nDepth (cm) a 21.00 (\u00b16.42) 8.80 (\u00b13.25) 21.60 (\u00b12.98) 25.50 (\u00b12.35) 36.33 (\u00b17.12) \n\npHa 6.80 (\u00b10.05) 8.20 (\u00b10.14) 7.35 (\u00b10.24) 6.92 (\u00b10.04) 7.10 (\u00b10.08) \n\nOxygen (mg\u00b7L-1)a 9.38 (\u00b10.36) 10.10 (\u00b10.64) 11.44 (\u00b11.07) 6.50 (\u00b10.18) 6.18 (\u00b10.94) \n\nConductivity (?S\u00b7cm-1)a 132.72 (\u00b18.49) 275.40 (\u00b119.58) 83.78 (\u00b14.26) 619.33 (\u00b132.83) 697.17 (\u00b136.79) \n\nChemical oxygen demand \n(COD; mg\u00b7L-1)b \n\n6.90 (\u00b11.42) 5.97 (\u00b10.54) 7.09 (\u00b12.69) &lt;2.1 4.08 (\u00b13.03) \n\nBiochemical oxygen \ndemand (BOD5; mg\u00b7L?1) \n\n&lt;3.3 &lt;3.3 &lt;3.3 &lt;3.3 &lt;3.3 \n\nPhosphates (PO3? \n\n4; mg\u00b7L?1)b \n\n0.50 (\u00b10.25) 0.45 (\u00b10.00) 0.64 (\u00b10.33) 0.33 (\u00b10.03) 0.46 (\u00b10.05) \n\nTotal P (P; mg\u00b7L?1)b 0.39 (\u00b10.07) 0.49 (\u00b10.26) 0.69 (\u00b10.45) 0.34 (\u00b10.09) 0.46 (\u00b10.18) \n\nTotal N (N; mg\u00b7L?1)b 0.64 (\u00b10.23) 0.23 (\u00b10.16) 0.28 (\u00b10.21) 0.26 (\u00b10.20) 0.13 (\u00b10.07) \n\nNitrates (NO3-; mg\u00b7L?1)b 2.28 (\u00b10.58) 2.01 (\u00b10.24) 0.78 (\u00b10.41) 2.61 (\u00b10.38) 3.03 (\u00b10.63) \n\nAlcalinity (CaCO3; mg\u00b7L?1)b 116.35 (\u00b196.45) 71.54 (\u00b112.40) 70.35 (\u00b160.75) 208.85 (\u00b116.95) 282.35 (\u00b169.55) \n\nHabitat Quality Assessment \n(HQA score) \n\n41 22 42 24 33 \n\na all sampling values; b spring values. \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n128 \n\n5.3.2 Macroinvertebrate patterns \n\nA total of 114 different macroinvertebrate taxa were identified for all sites throughout \n\nthe study, comprising a total of 26,631 individuals. Taxa such as Ancylus fluviatilis \n\n(Planorbidae; Gastropoda), Baetis spp. (Baetidae; Ephemeroptera), Echinogammarus spp. \n\n(Gammaridae; Amphipod), Orthocladiinae (Chironomidae; Diptera), Perlodidae (Plecoptera), \n\nOulimnius spp. (Elmidae; Coleoptera) and Simulidae (Diptera) were among the most \n\nabundant (above 1,100 total individuals). \n\nThe MDS (stress 0.11) analysis showed a partial segregation between macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities from pre-drought (s1) and post-drought (s6) conditions; however, for two sites \n\n(Boialvo and Serra), the s1 and s6 communities were more similar to each other than in the \n\nother cases (Figure 5.3A). The ANOSIM test confirmed differences in macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunity composition between the two sampling events: s1 was different from s6 (Global R \n\n= 0.30, p=0.02), despite the high variability within groups. \n\nThe SIMPER analysis revealed 88.3% dissimilarity in the macroinvertebrate community \n\nbetween samples in the pre-drought year (s1) and the post-drought year (s6). This high \n\ndissimilarity was mainly due to a decrease in s6 (post-drought) of the mean abundance of \n\ntaxa such as Baetis spp., Echinogammarus spp., Ancylus fluviatilis, Simuliidae, Hydroporus spp. \n\n(Dytiscidae; Coleoptera) and Perlodidae and an increase of Leptophebiidae, Oligochaeta, \n\nDugesia spp. (Dugesiidae; Turbellaria) and Orthocladiinae (Table 5.2).  \n\nWhen analysing all sampling events, metrics such as the richness (number of taxa), \n\nnumber of EPT taxa, Coleoptera richness and IPtI index followed a similar short-term \n\nrecovery pattern (Figure 5.4b, d, f, g), i.e., values obtained in spring 2011 (s1) generally \n\ndecreased after the drought event (s2) and progressively recovered over time along sampling \n\nevents (s3, s4, s5) until spring 2012 (s6). For the remaining metrics (evenness and Diptera \n\nrichness), the values increased or did not changed immediately after the drought event (s2) \n\nand remained generally unchanged over 12 months until s6 (Figure 5.4c, e). However, when \n\nevaluating the significant differences among sampling events (PERMANOVA pair-wise test), \n\nthe total number of individuals in s1 was different from s2 (t=3.48; p=0.01), s4 (t=2.47; \n\np=0.03) and s6 (t=2.89; p=0.01). Moreover, the abundance in s2 was different from s5 \n\n(t=2.76; p=0.01). Further, the total number of macroinvertebrates decreased sharply by \n\n91.5% from s1 to s2 and recovered by 83.7 % from s2 to s5. However, when comparing \n\nspring 2011 and spring 2012, the total number of macroinvertebrates decreased by 77.6% \n\n(from s1 to s6; Figure 5.4a).  \n\nAlthough we found no significant differences in richness (p>0.05, PERMANOVA), the \n\nrichness decreased by 45.3% from s1 to s2 (sampling just after the drought event) but \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n129 \n\nrecovered again in s5 (42.6 %). After one year (s6), the taxa richness was 12.5% lower \n\ncompared with the pre-drought condition (s1; Figure 5.4b). \n\nPielou\u2019s evenness in s1 was different from s2 (t=3.90; p=0.016), s3 (t=2.86; p=0.040) and \n\ns6 (t=2.42; p=0.038) according to the PERMANOVA pair-wise test results. The evenness \n\nincreased by an average of 30.5% for all sites from s1 to s2. Overall, from s1 to s6, the \n\ncommunity evenness presented an increase of 23.7% (Figure 5.4c).  \n\nNo significant differences were found in the EPT taxa and Coleoptera and Diptera \n\nrichness (p>0.05, PERMANOVA pair-wise test) among the sampling events; however, a \n\npattern was detected. In s2, rheophilic taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and \n\nTrichoptera decreased abruptly by 77.4% from s1 but progressively recovered over the \n\nduration of the sampling events, increasing by 73.1% until s5. After one year, these specific \n\ntaxa had decreased 32.7% (from spring 2011 to spring 2012; Figure 5.4d). As for Diptera, in \n\nthe majority of sites, the tendency was to maintain or increase the number of families (mean \n\nincreased of 16.7%) after one year (Figure 5.4e). In addition, Diptera richness in s2 only \n\ndecreased by 5 % when compared to s1. In the case of Coleoptera, the number of families \n\ndecreased by 40.0% in s2 from s1 but recovered progressively by 38.8% until s5. Over one \n\nyear of sampling, the Coleoptera richness decreased by approximately 10.0% from s1 to s6 \n\n(Figure 5.4f). \n\nFinally, regarding the IPtI (macroinvertebrate index) given by the EQR values, the \n\nquality status in s1 was different from s2 (t=3.48; p=0.01), s4 (t=2.47; p=0.03) and s6 (t=2.89; \n\np=0.02); this indicates that EQR values after one year (s6) had not recovered their initial \n\nstatus of high ecological quality. In addition, s2 was different from s5 (t=2.76; p=0.01). The \n\nlowest quality status for all streams was observed in s2 (first sampling just after the drought \n\nevent), with a mean EQR value of 0.49 (\u00b10.09), which indicates a moderate quality status \n\n(Figure 5.4g). \n\nTable 5.2 - Macroinvertebrate taxa contributing 88.3% to the mean dissimilarity (SIMPER analysis) \n\nbetween s1 and s6 (spring 2011 pre-drought and spring 2012 post-drought, respectively) with their \n\npercentage contribution, average dissimilarity and standard deviation (SD).

However, no \n\nsignificant differences were confirmed (Global R=0.1, p>0.05; ANOSIM). The dissimilarity was \n\n65.4% (SIMPER analysis) between spring 2011 (s1) and spring 2012 (s6), which was mainly \n\ndue to the disappearance of species in post-drought samples such as Cocconeis euglypta \n\nEhrenberg, Amphora pediculus (K\u00fctzing) Grunow ex A. Schmidt, Reimeria sinuata (W. \n\nGregory) Kociolek &amp; Stoermer and Cocconeis placentula var. lineata (Ehrenberg.) Van Heurck \n\nand the appearance of others like Nitzschia palea var. debilis (K\u00fctzing) Grunow and Fragilaria \n\ngracilis (\u00d8strup). In addition, Gomphonema rhombicum Fricke and Eolimna minima (Grunow) \n\nLange-Bertalot &amp; W. Schiller were among the species that contributed the most for this \n\ndissimilarity by decreasing, whereas species such as Planothidium frequentissimum (Lange-\n\nBertalot) Lange-Bertalot, Planothidium lanceolatum (Br\u00e9bisson ex K\u00fctzing) Lange-Bertalot, \n\nNavicula veneta K\u00fctzing and Karayevia oblongella increased in s6 compared to s1 (Table 5.3). \n\nWhen analysing the selected metrics in all streams, we found that richness and evenness \n\nfor the diatom assemblages showed the same recovery trend over the sampling events from \n\ns2 to s6 (Figure 5.5a, c), despite there being no significant differences (p>0.05; PERMANOVA \n\npair-wise test).

The macroinvertebrates significantly decreased their abundance when the water \n\nfirst resumed, whereas the diatoms apparently did not differ from the pre-drought-sampled \n\ncommunity. In fact, the same pattern prevailed after a year. The diatom biodiversity was not \n\nsignificantly altered over the rewetting progression. This could be because, when compared \n\nto macroinvertebrates, diatoms have a rapid life cycle and a consequently rapid ability to \n\ncolonise a habitat. Oemke and Burton (1986) concluded that a period between 14 days to one \n\nmonth was adequate to complete the colonization of artificial substrates, attaining the \n\nequivalent to mature diatom communities, which was quite similar to the recovery time that \n\nwe found in the present study (approximately two weeks). Despite their short life cycle, \n\ndiatoms are capable of persisting in refuges during the dry period (Robson et al., 2008). \n\nFurthermore, many benthic algal species are able to resist desiccation due to physiological \n\nadaptations such as thick cell walls or resistant propagules, facilitating recolonisation \n\n(Steinman and McIntire, 1990). Regarding benthic invertebrates, the reduced flow and \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n135 \n\ndecreased water velocity were not beneficial to taxa strongly dependent on flowing water, \n\nsuch as the EPT taxa (Boulton, 2003; Lake, 2003), whereas it had no effect on Diptera or \n\nColeoptera. The latter taxa are most likely able to better tolerate extreme drought because \n\nthey have desiccation-resistant stages (Coleoptera) or are capable of surviving in moist \n\nstreambeds (Diptera; Lake, 2003; Boulton and Lake, 2008). Indeed, we found an increase of \n\ntaxa resistant to drying and typically characteristic of intermittent systems, such as \n\nOligochaeta and several Diptera (Frouz et al., 2003; Dumnicka and Koszalka, 2005). \n\nFor both studied benthic elements, the increase in evenness immediately after the \n\ndewatering event followed the pattern of the first colonisation stages of empty niches (Begon \n\net al., 1996). In the particular case of diatoms, the dominant species were generally \n\ncharacteristic of oligo- to eutraphentic environments, suggesting that the community shifted \n\nfrom the first colonisation stages to a stage of response from the stress affecting the site (van \n\nDam, 1994). \n\n \n\nDrought effects on the evaluation of the ecological status \n\nRegarding the biological quality, the IPS index for diatoms was similar over the \n\nrewetting progression, but the quality status decreased after one year; this indicates that a \n\nshift in species occurred. Indeed, there was a shift from more sensitive species such as \n\nReimeria sinuata and Cocconeis placentula var. lineata in spring 2011 to less sensitive or even \n\ntolerant species such as Nitzschia palea and Nitzschia palea var. debilis in spring 2012. \n\nMoreover, despite the initial similarity between the studied streams, the drought appeared to \n\ninduce different environmental (physical and chemical) changes in the streams that led to an \n\nirregular response of the diatom communities to the drought. Similarly, Boix et al. (2010) did \n\nnot find linear or uniform changes in the taxonomic composition or structural physiognomy \n\nof diatom communities in streams affected by hydrological alteration. \n\nContrary to diatoms, stream water quality, given by the macroinvertebrate IPtI index, \n\ndecreased with the drought event, and although it did not reach the initial reference values \n\nafter one year, our streams gradually recovered during the winter season. Both communities \n\nprovide reliable information on water quality (e.g., Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002; Rimet et al., \n\n2005). Diatoms are more sensitive to changes in water chemistry, whereas invertebrates are \n\nmore susceptible to channel morphological changes and habitat conditions (Passy et al., \n\n2004). Under drought effects, their simultaneous use for bioassessment should be \n\nconsidered, as their responses are different and appear to be complementary (Feio et al., \n\n2007), particularly if considering responses at different temporal scales. In addition, these \n\nstructural bioassessment measures using taxonomic composition may be complemented by \n\nadding trait-based metrics (e.g., body size, life cycle duration, dispersal ability, respiration \n\ntype), which indirectly provide information on the ecological functioning of streams (Dol\u00e9dec \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n136 \n\nand Statzner, 2010) and could therefore yield accurate insights into the assessment of \n\nextreme events such as droughts. \n\nThe role of habitat features in drought resistance and resilience \n\nThe river habitat characteristics appeared to play an important role in the recovery of \n\nmacroinvertebrate and diatom communities. Our study showed that the initial condition of \n\nstreams was important in the recovery process, as the communities of streams displaying \n\nbetter environmental conditions (e.g., riparian corridors, HQA) recovered faster and easier \n\nfrom extreme disturbances, which is in agreement with other authors (e.g., Sponseller et al., \n\n2001; Elosegi et al., 2010; Thomson et al., 2012). It is known that benthic communities are \n\nstrongly influenced by local riparian conditions (Lammert and Allan, 1999; Sponseller et al., \n\n2001; Poole and Berman, 2001; Elias et al., 2012), which might generate a buffer favouring \n\nhumidity and lower temperatures by shading. Moreover, the heterogeneity of habitats within \n\nthe channel and the availability, size and the spatial distribution of refugia during drought \n\nlikely played a crucial role not only in the communities\u2019 resistance but also in their resilience \n\n(Magoulick and Kobza, 2003; Lake, 2003) to the dewatering event in the streams of this \n\nstudy. By moving to moist leaf litter or to the moisture under rocks and bark, migrating to the \n\nhyporheic zone or burrowing into the bed of the water body (Boulton et al., 1992; Clinton et \n\nal., 1996; Magoulick and Kobza, 2003), the communities found drought refugia that enabled \n\nthem to survive and progressively recover. \n\nUnder the current climate change scenario and consequent unpredictability of extreme \n\nevents such as the occurrence of dewatering droughts in small, typically perennial streams, \n\nthe maintenance of morphological riverine features that enhance habitat quality (e.g., \n\ncontinuous riparian corridors, channel habitat heterogeneity) constitutes a determining \n\nfactor in the continued resilience of aquatic ecosystems (Lake, 2003). \n\n5.5 Conclusion \n\nOur study revealed that isolated, unusual dewatering drought events in temperate \n\nstreams affected primary and secondary producers despite their differences in reaction and \n\nrecovery patterns. The ability of diatom assemblages to recover faster than \n\nmacroinvertebrates after a drought is most likely due to their shorter life cycles, capability to \n\nremain in refuges and physiological adaptations to dryness. We also found that the quality of \n\nthe habitat appears crucial to minimise the impact and accelerate the recovery processes of \n\nthese key riverine biological communities as soon as water returns to the channel. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n137 \n\nWith increasing anthropogenic pressures and climatic alterations, we expect biological \n\ncommunities of temperate streams to change through time to comprise more pollution-\n\ntolerant taxa and those with a higher resilience to extreme drought events. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nEQR Ecological Quality Ratios \n\nHQA Habitat Quality Assessment \n\nIPS Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique \n\nIPtI \u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados \n\nMDS non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \n\nRHS River Habitat Survey \n\nS1 Samples collected in spring 2011 (May), before the severe and uncharacteristic \n\ndrought event, pre-drought condition \n\nS2 to \n\nS5 \n\nSamples collected biweekly in winter (between November 2011 and January \n\n2012), after the drought period when normal flow conditions were re-established, \n\npost-drought condition \n\nS6 Samples collected in spring 2012 (May), after the drought period when normal \n\nflow conditions were re-established, post-drought condition \n\nWFD Water Framework Directive \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nWe would like to thank the Institute of Marine Research (IMAR-CIC) and the GeoBioTec \n\nResearch Unit and Biology Department of the University of Aveiro for making their facilities \n\navailable and providing funding, as well as the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia for \n\nproviding financial support through the AQUAWEB project (PTDC/AACAMB/105297/2008) \n\nand a PhD scholarship to the second author (SFRH /BD/68973/2010) financed by the Fundo \n\nNacional do MEC and the program POPH-QREN Tipologia 4.1.

A major issue is that of substrate preferences, which may result in \n\ndifferences in production, and assemblage structure and composition, and which should be \n\ntaken into account for water quality assessment studies. Thus in this work, the periphyton \n\ngrown on sand and ceramic tiles in indoor controlled channels were compared to understand \n\nif substrate differences lead to differences in: periphyton production (chlorophyll-a), \n\nchlorophyll-b and c concentrations, diatom assemblages (diversity-Shannon-Wiener, cell \n\ndensity, taxonomic composition, trait proportions) and water quality assessments (IPS - \n\n\u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019). A combined inoculum of periphyton from four \n\nPortuguese streams was introduced to the running channels (six sand and six tile) and left to \n\ncolonize for 35 days. Epilithic (tiles) and epipsammic (sand) assemblages were sampled at \n\ndays 14 and 35. We verified that there were no differences in chlorophyll-a concentration \n\nover time and between substrates. On both sampling moments the epipsammic assemblages \n\nhad higher concentration of chlorophyll-c and diatom density but without significant \n\ndifferences over time in each substrate. The taxonomic composition was different between \n\nsubstrates and over time. However, these differences were not reflected in water quality \n\nassessment. The diversity was also similar between substrates in both sampling moments but \n\nit was higher at day 14. Mobile and stalked species were more abundant over the entire study \n\nand differed significantly between substrates, with the epipsammic assemblages presenting \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n146 \n\nhigher abundances of both traits. We concluded that the colonizing substrate influences \n\ndiatom assemblages but not the water quality assessment. \n\nKewords \n\nDiatoms, chlorophyll, traits, mesocosm, water quality assessment, freshwater \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n147 \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nStreams are continuously affected by erosion and deposition processes, which along \n\nwith lithology, slope, current, degree of disturbance, and distance from headwaters result in \n\ndifferent sediment sizes (Cattaneo et al., 1997; Rolland et al., 1997). Therefore, there are \n\nstreams where rocks dominate (large stable substrates), streams that within the same site \n\nhave large stable and small unstable substrates (e.g., sand), and even streams with fine \n\nunstable substrates only (in particular lowland sites). Substrate type, texture, roughness and \n\nstability/instability (granulometry) are relevant habitat criteria for the interactions between \n\nbenthic algae and their substrates (Cattaneo et al., 1997; Hunt and Parry, 1998; Janauer and \n\nDokulil, 2006; Bergey and Cooper, 2015). Substrate size can affect the abundance and \n\ncomposition of the attached algae by providing different degrees of stability to colonizing \n\norganisms (Cattaneo et al., 1997). Several studies have addressed the distinct associations of \n\nperiphyton on different substrates (e.g., rock surface, upper layer of sediment, or aquatic \n\nplants) through their biovolume, diversity, algal assemblages and chlorophyll concentration \n\n(e.g., Cattaneo et al., 1997; Rolland et al., 1997; Sabater et al., 1998; Potapova and Charles, \n\n2005). \n\nAmong algae, diatoms have been selected in most European countries as representative \n\nof periphyton (Almeida and Feio, 2012; Kelly et al., 2012; Feio et al., 2014) namely due to \n\ntheir good performance as water quality indicators (Lowe and Pan, 1996; Kelly et al., 1998; \n\nStevenson and Pan, 1999). From all types of substrates found in rivers, most studies focus on \n\nepilithon (Winter and Duthie, 2000), as hard surfaces are the preferred substrates used in \n\nwater quality assessment (Kelly et al., 1998). However, other substrates like submerged \n\nmacrophytes and sediments are also commonly found and may be dominant in some stream \n\nand river sections (Kelly et al., 1998; Elias et al., 2015). Some studies indicate that benthic \n\ndiatom species present different biological characteristics that enable them to adapt to \n\nspecific micro-habitats (Krejci and Lowe, 1986; Soininen and Eloranta, 2004). If these natural \n\ninter-substrate differences are reflected in water quality assessment metrics, this can \n\npotentially mask responses of algal assemblages to stresses associated with human activities \n\nand may interfere with water quality assessments based on the knowledge of these responses \n\n(Winter and Duthie, 2000; Potapova and Charles, 2005; Bere and Tundisi, 2011; Mendes et \n\nal., 2012). However, some studies have tested the effect of different substrates in water \n\nquality assessments without finding significant differences (Kitner and Poul\u00ed?kov\u00e1, 2003; \n\nPotapova and Charles, 2005; Mendes et al., 2012). These studies were conducted under \n\nnatural conditions where the assemblages are shaped simultaneously by many \n\nenvironmental factors which may lead to confounding effects (Stevenson and Pan, 1999). In \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n148 \n\naddition the substrate effect is difficult to detect in large-scale, coarse resolution studies, \n\nwhen the role of other factors, such as inter-stream differences in hydrology, physical habitat, \n\nand chemistry become more important than the role of substrate (Potapova and Charles, \n\n2005). Even when different diatom assemblages of the same river are compared and \n\ndifferences are verified (Cetin, 2008) it is difficult to ensure that the assemblages have been \n\nexposed to the same environmental variations at the same time or even at the same \n\ndevelopmental phase. Additionally, it is impossible to avoid contamination between \n\nsubstrates with diatoms migrating between habitats in wadeable streams. \n\nTherefore, the present work was conducted ex situ under controlled experimental \n\nconditions to investigate: (1) if algae assemblages establishing on new hard (ceramic tiles) \n\nand soft (sand) substrates become significantly different concerning chlorophyll-a (chl-a), b \n\n(chl-b) and c (chl-c) concentrations, diversity (Shannon-Wiener, H\u2019), density (cells\u00b7cm-2), \n\ntaxonomic composition and trait proportions; (2) how they evolve over time (up to five \n\nweeks of colonization) on the different substrates (3) and if differences in diatom \n\nassemblages on the different substrates result in differences in water quality assessment. The \n\nwater quality of the channels was assessed by using a common autoecological diatom method \n\nwhich is also the Portuguese official index, the \u2018Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique\u2019 (IPS) for \n\nmonitoring programs, in the context of the Water Framework Directive (INAG, 2009). \n\n6.2 Methods \n\n6.2.1 Experimental system description \n\nThe experimental system was composed of twelve modular mesocosm systems (MMS). \n\nEach MMS was composed of one Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, 8 mm thick) mesocosm \n\nchannel (150 cm long, 10 cm wide and 12 cm high) with a maximum functional volume of \n\napproximately 18 L, connected to a PMMA (8 mm thick) water reservoir (60 cm long, 10 cm \n\nwide, and 45 cm high), operating with a maximum functional water volume of approximately \n\n27 L (Figure 6.1).  \n\nThe MMS operated in recirculated system. Water in the reservoir was pumped through a \n\n25 mm PVC (polyvinyl chloride) inlet pipe system, which allowed flow direction regulation in \n\nthe mesocosm channel, by a submerged water pump (EHEIM compact+ 3000, Germany) that \n\ncan operate with a regulated water flow from 200 to 2000 L/h. The water outlet pipe system, \n\nfrom the mesocosm channel to the reservoir, was built with 50 mm PVC pipe, with an \n\nadjustable damper placed close to the end of the mesocosm channel, which allowed the \n\nregulation of water level.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n149 \n\nEach mesocosm channel was illuminated from above with T5 HO 80W tubular \n\nfluorescent lamps, Lumilux - 8000 K (Osram, Germany). The distance from the illumination \n\nsystem and the water surface was adjustable in order to control the photosynthetic active \n\nradiation (PAR). \n\n6.2.2 Experimental Set-up \n\nAt the beginning of the experiment 25 L of tap water was fed to the water deposit of each \n\nchannel, after passing through 5 \u00b5m wound polypropylene and active carbon filters to \n\nremove suspended particulate matter and free chlorine, respectively. The water depth in \n\nmesocosm tanks was kept at 5 cm. Water velocity was maintained at approximately 0.05 m/s. \n\nThe illumination systems were positioned at about 1 m above the channels to provide light to \n\nthe attached algae (?200 \u00b5mol/m2/s) with a 12h:12h light-dark cycle. Water temperature \n\nwas measured by K-type thermocouples (Testo 176T4 data logger) and maintained within 17 \n\n\u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C during the experiment. This was possible with the help of an air conditioning \n\nsystem and a well-isolated experimental room that was able to minimize air temperature \n\nvariations. \n\nThe bottom of all mesocosm channels (n=12) was covered with 62 unglazed ceramic \n\ntiles-T (40 \u00d7 50 mm in size). In 6 of the channels (n=6) the tiles were completely covered with \n\nabout 1 cm depth of sand bed-S (98% SiO2, 2 mm particles). A two week preliminary study \n\nrevealed that the tiles did not influence the chemical composition of the circulating water. \n\nHowever, in order to exclude any previously undetected differences due to the tile chemical \n\ncomposition, and as the sand is almost inert (SiO2), the tiles were kept under the sand bed in \n\nthe sand channels.  \n\nBiofilms samples were collected from four streams in the Portuguese littoral region and \n\nmixed in 1 L bottle to be used as inoculum in the channels. These biofilm included epilithic \n\nand epipsammic assemblages. Each channel (n=12) was seeded with 60 mL inoculum at the \n\nbeginning of the experiment. Thereafter, 10 L (40%) of water was removed from each \n\nchannel on a weekly basis and immediately replaced by 10 L of new filtered tap water. The \n\ntotal duration of the experiment was 35 days (d35). The streams were selected to obtain a \n\ndiverse inoculum community representative of the different streams found in the central-\n\nwestern Portuguese region (Atlantic-temperate climate). This includes a variety of streams \n\nwith streambeds ranging from rocks to sand, and with a variety of human pressures (from \n\nleast to highly disturbed) (Feio et al., 2010; Elias et al., 2015).\n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing with implications in bioassessment \n\n150 \n\n \nFigure 6.1 - Cross-section of one of the twelve modular mesocosm systems used in the laboratory experiments. See Appendix IV. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n151 \n\n6.2.3 Water, periphyton sampling and treatment \n\nThe inoculum was left to colonize the substrates in the channels for an initial period of \n\nseven days, after which water replacement and sampling was initiated. Water samples from \n\nthe channels and from the tap were collected weekly (d0, d7, d14, d21, d28 and d35) for \n\ndetermination of alkalinity (mg HCO3-/L), nitrate (mg NO3-/L), silica (mg Si/L), chloride (mg \n\nCl-/L), phosphate (mg PO43-/L) and sulphate (mg SO42-/L). Several (from one to every two \n\ndays) in situ measurements of pH, conductivity (\u00b5S/cm), and percentage of total dissolved \n\noxygen were made using a Multiparameter Probe 3430 WTW throughout the experiment. \n\nPeriphyton samples were randomly retrieved from each channel at two sampling moments: \n\nday 14 (d14) and day 35 (d35). For a given sampling moment, periphyton samples were \n\ntaken from the same position in each channel; however, the sampling position varied with the \n\nsampling moment and was always done downstream to upstream to minimize disturbance \n\neffects. For each sampling moment four subsamples (four tiles) were collected along the \n\nchannel in order to embrace all the possible assemblages variability that can exist within the \n\nchannel. Afterward, these subsamples were all merge in just one sample per channel in each \n\nsampling moment. \n\nFor the epilithic biofilm (tiles), the upper surface of 4 tiles (80.0 cm2 per channel) was \n\nscraped with a toothbrush and washed with distilled water into a flask. In epipsammon \n\nbiofilm (sand) sampling, an area of 57.8 cm2 of the upper surface of the sand bed was \n\ncollected into a flask using a syringe. Two distinct samples of each channel were collected at \n\neach sampling moment, one for diatom analysis and another for chlorophyll determination \n\n(chl-a, chl-b and chl-c). The area contained in the volume treated was always assured so that \n\nthe results obtained could be expressed per unit area of substrate. \n\nFor the determination of chlorophylls, the total area sampled (80.0 cm2 and 57.8 cm2 for \n\nepilithic and epipsammom, respectively) of each channel was used. Following Branco et al. \n\n(2010), the samples were repeatedly centrifuged (2000 rpm) for five minutes until all the \n\nwater was removed and only a pellet remained. Pigments were extracted with 2 mL of \n\nacetone (90%v) from the pellet; the extract was protected from light and maintained in the \n\ncold. To break the cells, samples on ice were sonicated in 4 cycles of 15 seconds. The extract \n\nwas stirred for 30 minutes in a refrigerated environment and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm \n\nfor 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. Chlorophylls-a, b and c were quantified spectrophotometrically and its \n\nconcentration (in \u00b5g\u00b7cm-2) calculated following the procedure of Jeffrey and Humphrey \n\n(1975).

The remaining sample was preserved with formaldehyde (5 to 10% final \n\nconcentration). Thereafter, a known volume of the oxidised sample was deposited on a \n\ncoverslip and allowed to dry at room temperature. Permanent slides were mounted using \n\nNaphrax\u00ae. Using a light microscope (100x objective and 1.32 numerical aperture), all the \n\nunbroken diatom valves for each sample were counted and identified to species or infra-\n\nspecific rank mainly using Krammer and Lange-Bertalot\u2019s floras (1986, 1988, 1991a, b) and \n\nKrammer (2000, 2001, 2009). From those, diatom cell density was determined and \n\nextrapolated to the unit area (cm2) of each sample; species diversity (H\u2019) and assemblage \n\nanalysis were also derived. The diatom index IPS (Coste in Cemagref, 1982) was also \n\ncalculated with the OMINIDIA software (Lecointe et al., 1993). \n\nPermanent slides, with the inoculum of biofilm introduced in the channels, were also \n\nmounted and up to 400 diatom valves counted according to the aforementioned description. \n\nPrior to oxidation, microscopic identification of all the samples (from the channels and \n\ninoculum) were also carried out to verify if other group of photosynthetic organisms besides \n\ndiatoms were present and dominating in the samples. \n\n6.2.4 Selection and calculation of biological traits \n\nThe biological characteristics that enable species to adapt more easily to specific \n\nsubstrates (here tile vs. sand) is the capacity to resist dislodgement caused to substrates by \n\nthe stream current and the capacity of moving vertically into or out of the sand depending on \n\nwater velocity. Thus variations in the diatom biological trait life-form were also investigated \n\nin this study by analysing changes in proportions of categories that have high potential to \n\ndistinguish epipsammic and epilithic diatom assemblages: mobile, planktonic, adnate, and \n\npad (Berthon et al., 2011; Rimet and Bouchez, 2011; Rimet and Bouchez, 2012).  \n\nEach species was assigned to all the trait categories that it could display, according to \n\nRimet and Bouchez (2012). For each sample, the total number of valves of all the species \n\npresenting a given trait category was counted. To obtain the total number of valves of each \n\ntrait category in each channel, the average of all the samples from the same treatment was \n\ncalculated. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n153 \n\n6.2.5 Data analysis \n\nA completely randomized design was used in the experiment. Statistical differences in \n\nchlorophyll concentrations, H\u2019, diatom cell density, IPS and biological diatom traits resulting \n\nfrom treatment effects were tested with the univariate analysis of variance (equivalent to \n\none-way models) PERMANOVA global tests with unrestricted permutations (Euclidean \n\ndissimilarity measure). Additionally, PERMANOVA pairwise tests with unrestricted \n\npermutations were performed to assess possible differences between sampling moments \n\n(d14 and d35), and substrates (S and T). These two sampling moments were selected as we \n\nconsider that at the 7th day differences between substrates were still not evident, and at least \n\none month has been recommended for sampling the equivalent of the 'mature\u2019 community \n\noccurring on natural substrates in the stream (Oemke and Burton, 1986; Kelly et al., 1998).  \n\nTo determine if the treatments lead to differences in the diatom assemblages a \n\nMultidimensional Scaling Analyses, MDS (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure; data square root \n\ntransformed) was performed. The statistical differences resulting from the treatment effects \n\nwere tested with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA equivalent) \n\nPERMANOVA global tests (unrestricted permutations). PERMANOVA pairwise tests \n\n(unrestricted permutations) were performed to assess at which sampling moments the \n\ntreatments (two substrates) were different and if the differences across treatments were \n\nconsistent over time. SIMPER analysis (data square root transformed, Bray-Curtis similarity) \n\nwas used to determine the most representative taxa (those contributing the most to the \n\naverage similarity within groups) of the different treatments and sampling moments. In \n\naddition, SIMPER analysis (presence/absence data, Bray-Curtis similarity) was used to \n\ndetermine the species that were present in a given substrate and absent from the other at the \n\nsame sampling moment and that contributed more to the group average dissimilarity.  \n\nAll the data analyses were performed with PRIMER 6 &amp; PERMANOVA software \n\n(PRIMER-E Ltd, Lutton, Plymouth, UK). \n\n6.3 Results \n\n6.3.1 Physical and chemical parameters \n\nOne of the tile channels was eliminated from the analysis due to difficulties in \n\nmaintaining the water temperature constant. Therefore, the results presented are from six \n\nchannels with sand and five with tiles.  \n\nThe water used throughout the experiment showed similar physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics in both treatments (see Table 6.1).

The mean highest chl-a concentration (0.134 \u00b5g/cm2) was \n\nobtained on sand at day 35 while the mean lowest concentration (0.075 \u00b5g/cm2) was \n\nobserved on tile at day 14. Chl-c concentration showed statistical differences between \n\nsubstrates. In both sampling moments the epipsammic assemblages presented a significantly \n\nhigher concentration of chl-c (Td14 vs. Sd14 t=2.80, p(MC)=0.02; Td35 vs. Sd35 t=2.80, \n\np(MC)=0.03) than the epilithic assemblages. The mean highest chl-c value (0.025 \u00b5g/cm2) \n\nwas obtained on sand at d35 while the mean lowest concentration (0.007 \u00b5g/cm2) was \n\nobtained on tile at both d14 and d35. This variable did not vary significantly along time for a \n\ngiven substrate (Td14 vs. Td35 t=0.18, p(MC)=0.92; Sd14 vs. Sd35 t=1.93, p(MC)=0.08) \n\n(Figure 6.2b).  \n\nThe chl-b concentration values were inferior to the values of the other chlorophylls. The \n\nmean highest chl-b concentration (0.009 \u00b5g/cm2) was obtained on the sand at d14. Chl-b only \n\nvaried along time on the epipsammic assemblages (Td14 vs. Td35 t=2.36, p(MC)=0.05; Sd14 \n\nvs. Sd35 t=8.84, p(MC)<0.01) (Figure 6.2c). Considering sampling moments the epilithic \n\nassemblages never presented significant higher chl-b concentrations (Td14 vs. Sd14 t=1.90, \n\np(MC)=0.12; Td35 vs. Sd35 t=2.77, p(MC)=0.08) (Figure 6.2c). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n155 \n\n \nFigure 6.2 - (a) Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), (b) chlorophyll-c (Chl-c) and (c) chlorophyll-b (Chl-b) \n\nconcentrations (mean\u00b1standard deviation) of the algal assemblages developing on tiles (T) and sand \n\n(S) substrates at day 14 and 35 in the artificial channels.

The other two groups from which we identified \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n156 \n\nmore individuals were Chlorophyta (e.g., Scenedesmus, Ankistrodesmus, Coelastrum and \n\nMonoraphidium) and Cyanobacteria (e.g., Chroococcus).  \n\nThe analysis of the inoculum sample used to seed the channels revealed that the most \n\nabundant species were Staurosira venter (Ehrenberg) Cleve &amp; J. D. M\u00f6eller, Achnanthidium \n\nminutissimum (K\u00fctzing) Czarnecki and Asterionella formosa Hassall even though they never \n\nexceeded 10% abundance. \n\nIn total 174 diatom species were identified during the counting of all the samples \n\ncollected from the channels. The corresponding total number of valves counted ranged from \n\n568 to 2586. The epipsammic diatom assemblages presented higher cell density in both \n\nsampling moments when compared to the epilithic assemblages (Td14 vs. Sd14 t=2.59, \n\np(perm)=0.03; Td35 vs. Sd35 t=2.39, p(perm)=0.04); however, this variable was not different \n\nover time within each substrate (Td14 vs. Td35 t=1.44, p(perm)=0.23; Sd14 vs. Sd35 t=1.76, \n\np(perm)=0.11) (Figure 6.3).  \n\n \nFigure 6.3 - Diatom density (cells/cm2) (mean\u00b1standard deviation) found in the assemblages \n\ndeveloping on tiles (T) and sand (S) substrates at day 14 and 35 in the artificial channels. Treatment \n\nmeans labelled with the same letter (a, b, c) do not significantly differ (p>0.05; PERMANOVA pairwise \n\ntest). \n\nIn terms of diatom taxonomic composition we verified a segregation regarding both the \n\nsampling moment (Td14 vs. Td35 t=1.74, p(perm)<0.01; Sd14 vs. Sd35 t=1.68, p(perm)<0.01) \n\nand substrates (Td14 vs. Sd14 t=1.68, p(perm)<0.01; Td35 vs. Sd35 t=1.88, p(perm)<0.01) \n\n(Figure 6.4). For both substrates, the MDS and SIMPER analysis revealed that the \n\nassemblages of different channels at day 35 were less similar to each other than at day 14 \n\n(within group average similarity: T14=68.8%, S14=71.6%, T35=66.6%, S35=69.5%) (Figure \n\n6.4).  \n\nSpecies analysis (Table 6.2) showed that the species that contributed more to the within \n\ngroup average similarity in both sampling moments and substrates were the same but with \n\ndifferent contributing percentages to in-group similarity: Achnanthidium minutissimum \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n157 \n\n(13.6% to 23.9%), Fragilaria cf. parva (Grunow) A. Tuji &amp; D. M. Williams (6.0% to 11.6%) and \n\nNavicula notha J. H. Wallace (5.1% to 7.1%) (Table 6.2). The higher contribution of these \n\nspecies to the average similarity was verified at day 35 on both substrates. All these three \n\nspecies were also found in the inoculum: A. minutissimum presented an abundance of 9%, the \n\nspecies F. cf. parva and N. notha presented abundances of 2% and 6%, respectively.  \n\nThe differences between the substrates at the same sampling moment were due to less \n\nabundant taxa and to presence or absence of certain taxa. Comparing both substrates at day \n\n14, the epipsammic assemblages presented less species of the genus Navicula contributing to \n\nthe group similarity (Table 6.2) and a smaller number of species that were only present in the \n\nsand assemblages (7 species vs. 18 in the tile) (Table 6.3). Species such as Adlafia minuscula \n\nvar. muralis (Grunow) Lange-Bertalot, Surirella linearis W. Smith and Nitzschia sociabilis \n\nHustedt were only found in the epipsammic assemblages while species such as Hippodonta \n\ncapitata (Ehrenberg) Lange-Bertalot, Metzeltin &amp; Witkowski, Reimeria sinuata (W. Gregory) \n\nKociolek &amp; Stoermer and Navicula lanceolata Ehrenberg were only present in the epilithic \n\nassemblages (Table 6.3). However, the diversity was similar between substrates (Td14 vs. \n\nSd14 t=1.47, p(perm)=0.16) with mean values of 2.73 and 2.51, epilithic and epipsammic \n\nassemblages respectively (Figure 6.5). At day 35 the species belonging to the genus Nitzschia \n\ncontributed more to the sand group average similarity (Table 6.2). Once more, the \n\nepipsammic assemblages presented a smaller number of species that were only present in \n\nthe sand assemblages and that contributed to the group average dissimilarity (3 species vs. 8 \n\nin the tile) (Table 6.3). The species Diadesmis confervacea K\u00fctzing, Gomphonema cf. affine \n\nK\u00fctzing and Nitzschia acicularis (K\u00fctzing) W. Smith were only found in the epipsammic \n\nassemblages while species such as Nitzschia fonticola (Grunow) Grunow, Tryblionella \n\nhungarica (Grunow) Frenguelli and Planothidium lanceolatum (Br\u00e9bisson ex K\u00fctzing) Lange-\n\nBertalot were only present in the epilithic assemblages (Table 6.3). Despite these differences, \n\nthe diversity was similar between substrates (Td35 vs. Sd35 t=0.98, p(perm)=0.35) with \n\nmean values of 1.88 and 1.71 for epilithic and epipsammic assemblages, respectively (Figure \n\n6.5). \n\nThe comparison of the same substrate over time revealed that in both cases the number \n\nof species contributing to the within group average similarity decreased (up to 80% \n\ncumulative contribution; Table 6.2) with Achnanthidium minutissimum, Navicula notha and \n\nFragilaria cf. parva becoming most relevant at d35. From day 14 to day 35 there was a \n\nsignificant decrease in the diversity, independently of the substrate (Td14 vs. Td35 t=5.19, \n\np(perm)=0.01; Sd14 vs. Sd35 t=4.94, p(perm)<0.01) (Figure 6.5). \n\nDespite the different multidimensional patterns of the epilithic and epipsammic \n\ncommunities at the same sampling moment, the IPS values among the two substrates had a \n\ngood agreement (Td14 vs. Sd14 t=1.32, p(MC)=0.23; Td35 vs. Sd35 t=0.32, p(MC)=0.76) \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers.

Within sand assemblages there was \n\na significant increase in the number of stalked diatoms from d14 to d35 (Figure 6.7d). Despite \n\nthe apparent increase in the number of stalked valves in the tile over time, statistical \n\ndifferences were not found (Figure 6.7d).

This is in agreement with other studies that indicated that the \n\ncomposition of diatom assemblages on different substrates was different (Round, 1991; \n\nCattaneo et al., 1997; Potapova and Charles, 2005). Yet, contrary to our findings other studies \n\nhave not found differences between substrates (Rothfritz et al., 1997; Bere and Tundisi, 2011; \n\nWinter and Duthie, 2000). The differences found between the assemblage composition of the \n\ntwo substrates might be due to the species which dominated and were common to both \n\nsubstrates which is probably related to other factors. For example, both Achnanthidium \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n163 \n\nminutissimum and Navicula notha have high oxygen requirements (polyoxybionte; van Dam \n\net al., 1994) which was a condition satisfied by our experimental design.  \n\nWe also found a significantly higher number of mobile cells in sand compared with the \n\ntile substrates, which is in accordance with other studies (Cattaneo et al., 1997; Potapova and \n\nCharles, 2005). Stalked species were also always significantly more abundant in sand \n\ncompared with the tile, contrary to what we were expecting, as in the sand the majority of the \n\nspecies present will be those which have the necessary traits to tolerate the abrasion of \n\nmoving grains (Townsend and Gell, 2005) or be able to move (Soininen and Eloranta, 2004) \n\nin order to avoid entrapment by the sand grains. However, the species that contributed most \n\nto the stalk categories were from the genus Achnanthidium, in particular A. minutissimum. \n\nThis species has been found to dominate in highly hydrological disturbed habitats suggesting \n\nthat it may have resistance to the dislodgement induced by current shear forces (Soinine and \n\nEloranta, 2004).  \n\nContrary to what we were expecting (see also Potapova and Charles, 2005), at the same \n\nsampling moment, the sand assemblages were never more diverse than the tile assemblages. \n\nIt is expected that epilithic diatom assemblages are more stable than epipsammic ones \n\nbecause much less disturbance due to moving substrate particles occurs on firm stony \n\nsubstrates. Therefore, in natural environments the higher diversities found in natural \n\nepipsammic assemblages may be also due to the fact that in many occasions the sampled \n\nassemblage is not an undisturbed mature one. According to Tuji (2000) when a community is \n\nin the last phase of colonization of a substrate and is affected by a disturbance, the resulting \n\ncommunity architecture becomes similar to the first phase. Although the epipsammon \n\nrepresents a specialized diatom assemblage that seems well adapted to a variable \n\nenvironment, disturbance probably plays an important role in structuring the assemblage, \n\nkeeping it in a \u2018pioneer\u2019 state (Miller et al., 1987). So, when we allowed the assemblages to \n\ndevelop during the 35 days without additional disturbances it resulted in similar \n\ndevelopment states for both substrates and consequently similar diversities. This is in \n\nagreement with some studies dealing with differences in diatom assemblages among \n\ndifferent substrates, where the role of factors such as hydrology (Soininen and Eloranta, \n\n2004) and pollution (Bere and Tundisi, 2011) were found to overcome that of substrates. In \n\nsome situations the diversity differences may also be the result of significant differences at \n\nthe population level often associated with small algal populations that exert little influence on \n\ndensity and diversity, and these differences may be an artefact of a chance encounter of a rare \n\npopulation during algal enumeration (Lowe et al., 1996). \n\nRegarding the colonization process, and according to chl-c and diatom density by the \n\nfourteenth colonization day, diatom assemblages were already stable, independently of the \n\nsubstrate as there were no significant differences between sampling moments. In agreement, \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n164 \n\na study by Oemke and Burton (1986) dealing with diatom colonization dynamics (diatom cell \n\ndensities) growing on glass slides, showed that the rate of increase of diatom density slowed \n\nafter 10 or 14 days with the colonization curves reaching an apparent plateau by day 21 or \n\n28. Yet, contrary to diatom density, the last 21 days of colonization of our experiment \n\ncontributed to changes in the diatom assemblage\u2019s composition in both sand and tile \n\nchannels. These results suggest a decline of less abundant species and the dominance of a \n\nsmall number of species. Oemke and Burton (1986) verified also a gradual decline in \n\ndiversity after an early peak as a result of an increased dominance of few species. In addition, \n\nchanges in traits also occurred over time, with a significant increase of the category \u2018stalked\u2019 \n\non tiles from d14 to d35.  \n\nConsidering the water quality assessment, the IPS values obtained at the same sampling \n\nmoment did not reflect the differences in epipsammic and epilithic diatom assemblages that \n\nwere obtained in terms of multivariate patterns. As in other studies, this suggests that hard \n\nand soft (sand) substrates can be exchangeable in assessment methods that are based on \n\nautoecological methods (Soininen and K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, 2004; Potapova and Charles, 2005; Mendes \n\net al., 2012). Apparently, and considering the IPS results, the sand substrate assemblages \n\nwere not more influenced by the sediment-bound chemicals than the epilithic ones (Kelly et \n\nal., 1998). \n\nThe significant increase in the IPS values over time in both substrates can be attributed \n\nto the dominance of sensitive species at day 35, which is the case of Achnanthidium \n\nminutissimum, in the IPS index. This index is based on weighted average between the relative \n\nabundance and the sensitivity (tolerance) and indicator value of a group selected species. \n\nTherefore, the high abundance of a sensitive species, as A. minutissimum, may cause such \n\nincrease. This species has been considered indifferent to nutrient concentrations (van Dam et \n\nal., 1994); however a laboratory experiment carried out by Manoylov (2009) suggests that A. \n\nminutissimum is a good competitor for nutrients when they are in low supply compared with \n\nother taxa. Therefore, this adaptation may have allowed A. minutissimum to outgrow the \n\nother species by the end of the 35 days of colonization. \n\n6.5 Conclusions \n\nWe verified that both substrates reached an almost maximum production (diatom cell \n\ndensity and chl-c concentration) after two weeks of colonization although we did not find any \n\nclear patterns among diatom assemblage diversity. The type of colonizing substrate \n\ninfluences diatom assemblages (production, density and composition, traits) but not water \n\nquality assessment. Therefore, we can argue that in streams where the preferential substrate \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n165 \n\n(usually stones or rocks) is not available and sand is the only substrate available this can be \n\nused as alternative if the aim is to assess water quality using an autoecological index. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nChl-a Chlorophyll-a \n\nChl-b Chlorophyll-b \n\nChl-c Chlorophyll-c \n\nd14 Periphyton samples retrieved from the channels at day 14 \n\nd35 Periphyton samples retrieved from the channels at day 35 \n\nH\u2019 Shannon-Wiener diversity index \n\nIPS Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique \n\nMDS non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \n\nMMS modular mesocosm systems \n\nS Assemblages growing on sand substrate \n\nS14 Epipsammic samples retrieved from the channels at day 14 \n\nS35 Epipsammic samples retrieved from the channels at day 35 \n\nM Assemblages growing on tile substrate \n\nM14 Epilithic samples retrieved from the channels at day 14 \n\nM35 Epilithic samples retrieved from the channels at day 35 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgment \n\nThis study was possible due to the financial support of the FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE \n\nAND TECHNOLOGY (Portugal) through the Ph.D. scholarship SFRH/BD/68973/2010 of the \n\nfirst author and through the strategic project UID/MAR/04292/2013 granted to MARE and \n\nUID/GEO/04035/2013 granted to GeoBioTec.

We \n\ncompared diatom assemblages (at species, genus and order taxonomic levels) from 227 \n\nrivers and stream sites in regions of Europe (Portugal), North America (USA) and Australia \n\nbelonging to the Csb Mediterranean climate (updated world K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate map). At \n\nall levels, the diatom assemblages within each region were significantly more similar to each \n\nother than to those of the other regions (Pseudo-Fs: 23.00, 32.25, 28.99; p &lt;0.01). In \n\naddition, the Portuguese and USA assemblages were more similar to each other (Bray-Curtis \n\ndissimilarity 76.1%) than to the Australian ones (84.4 and 85.0%, respectively, at species \n\nlevel). Among the species that contributed most to similarity within Portuguese and USA \n\nrivers were Achnanthidium minutissimum (4.0-10.9 % contribution) and Cocconeis placentula \n\n(3.1-6.1% contribution) (SIMPER analyses). The species that contributed the most to \n\nsimilarity within Australian rivers were Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (13.0%) and Amphora \n\npediculus (6.9%) (SIMPER analyses). Climate did not appear to engender similar assemblages \n\nin the different regions, and the inter-continental differences observed were probably related \n\nto factors such as biogeography, geology and water chemistry. \n\n \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n172 \n\nKewords \n\nClimate, large-scale, continents, rivers, diatoms, taxonomical levels \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n173 \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nClimate, the long-term average weather conditions in an area, is one of the main factors \n\ncontrolling the large-scale distribution of species, communities and ecosystems (Lindsay and \n\nBayoh, 2004; Bailey, 2009). As the climatic regime changes (e.g., mean annual temperature), \n\nso does the hydrologic cycle (e.g., evapotranspiration) and consequently the variety of plants \n\nand animals that can live in a particular region (Bailey, 2009). Several studies have verified \n\nthat climate can be used to map the distribution of insects (Lindsay and Bayoh, 2004) and \n\nplants (Prentice et al., 1992) and can influence migratory frequencies (Dingle et al., 2000) and \n\nseed mass (Murray et al., 2004 ).  \n\nThe K\u00f6ppen system developed in 1900 by the climatologist Wladimir K\u00f6ppen (here \n\nreferred to as K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification) is the most widely used climatic classification for \n\ngeographic purposes (Peel et al., 2007; Bailey, 2009). It was constructed on the basis of five \n\nvegetation groups delineated by the botanist De Candolle, which were in turn based on the \n\nclimate zones of the ancient Greeks (Kottek et al., 2007; Peel et al., 2007). The five groups of \n\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climates distinguish five broad plant formations: tropical (A), arid (B), \n\ntemperate (C), cold zone (D) and polar (E) (Kottek et al., 2007; Peel et al., 2007; Bailey, 2009). \n\nThe classification has two more levels: a second letter considers precipitation (e.g., Cs for \n\ntemperate and dry summer, also called Mediterranean) and a third considers the air \n\ntemperature (e.g., Csb for temperate, dry and warm summer) (Kottek et al., 2007; Peel et al., \n\n2007). \n\nThe Mediterranean climate (Cs), although confined to less than 1% of the continental \n\narea (or up to 4% depending of the definition: see Gasith and Resh, 1999), is widely spread \n\nthrough almost all continents, occurring for example in the United States of America, \n\ncountries surrounding the Mediterranean sea, South Africa and Australia (Gasith and Resh, \n\n1999; Kottek et al., 2007; Peel et al., 2007). Streams and rivers in the Csa climate (temperate, \n\ndry and hot summer) are physically, chemically and biologically shaped by sequential, \n\npredictable and seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual hydrological cycle, and \n\nare those that are usually called Mediterranean streams (Boix et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., \n\n2011; Delgado et al., 2012). On the other hand, the streams and rivers experiencing Csb \n\nclimate are not typically so affected by these events of flooding and drying as they are mostly \n\nperennial streams.  \n\nThe long-term regime of natural environmental heterogeneity and disturbance patterns \n\nmay constitute a physical habitat template that constrains the appropriate species attributes \n\nfor local persistence (Poff and Ward, 1990). Due to the strong influence of Mediterranean \n\nclimate on several stream characteristics (e.g., hydrological regime, water temperature and \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n174 \n\nriparian inputs), communities of lotic ecosystems within that climatic region should be more \n\nsimilar to one another than those of other climatic regions (Gasith and Resh, 1999). Indeed, \n\nseveral studies have found similarities in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and their \n\ntraits among different Csa Mediterranean regions (Bonada et al., 2007; Garc\u00eda-Roger et al., \n\n2013) while the influence of Csb climate remains unstudied.  \n\nDiatoms typically respond to hydromorphological, chemical, and physical changes in the \n\nenvironment at small spatial scales (e.g., Potapova and Charles, 2003; Almeida and Feio, \n\n2012; Feio et al., 2014). However, these local environmental factors depend on and are \n\ninfluenced by ultimate factors such as climate, geology and land use (Stevenson, 1997). \n\nConsequently, climate is an important driver of diatom assemblages, and climatic variables \n\nmay have a stronger association with stream diatom distributions than local environmental \n\nvariables alone (Pajunen et al., 2016). Therefore, diatom assemblages from different Csb \n\nregions are likely to have similar composition. Although several studies of diatom \n\nassemblages have been carried out in Csb regions (Almeida and Gil, 2001; Potapova and \n\nCharles, 2003; Philibert et al., 2006; Feio et al., 2007; Feio et al., 2009), they did not \n\nspecifically assess the influence of climate. \n\nIn the present study we hypothesized that climatic similarity alone can lead to \n\nconsistency in the composition of benthic diatom assemblages, in spite of large-scale (inter-\n\ncontinental) separation and small-scale differences among rivers. We assessed the similarity \n\nof diatom assemblage composition from rivers and streams located in different continents \n\n(Europe, Australia and North America) but having in common the Csb Mediterranean climate, \n\naiming to verify whether climate indeed shapes diatom assemblage composition. We \n\nanalysed the similarities among the three regions at species, genus and order levels, in order \n\nto test the dependence of compositional similarity on taxonomic resolution. \n\n7.2 Methods \n\n7.2.1 Study area and site selection \n\nThe study included 227 river and stream sites in Cbs climatic regions: 139 in Europe - \n\nPortugal (PORT), 42 in North America \u2013 United States of America (USA) and 46 in Australia \n\n(AUS). The PORT sites were all within the northern region of the country, the USA sites were \n\nfrom the western states of California and Oregon, and the AUS sites were all in the coastal \n\nregion of the state of South Australia. The selection of Cbs regions followed the updated \n\nworld K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate map (Peel et al., 2007) and was done at macroclimatic scale \n\n(Bailey, 2009), mesoscale differences being ignored (e.g., high mountains were included as \n\nwell as lowland areas). \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n175 \n\n7.2.2 Diatom dataset \n\nThe PORT diatom dataset was obtained from a broad database (AQUAWEB: \n\nwww.aquaweb.pt) of diatom records for the entire country from 2004 to 2012. The USA \n\ndiatom dataset was obtained from the United States Water Quality Portal \n\n(http://waterqualitydata.us/portal/), which contains diatom counts for benthic river \n\nsamples collected by the USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program from \n\n1993 to 2005. The AUS diatom dataset was compiled under the national Monitoring River \n\nHealth Initiative program from 1995 to 1997. In all regions, sites were sampled more than \n\nonce and from more than one substratum and season (mostly from summer to autumn); the \n\nnumber of samples per site ranged from one to eighteen.  \n\nPortuguese sampling and sample treatment followed European standards (European \n\nCommittee for Standardisation, 2003, 2004, 2006) and Portuguese official protocols (INAG, \n\n2008). Samples were collected mostly from hard substrata. Identification to species or infra-\n\nspecific rank and enumeration were done with a light microscope (100\u00d7 objective and 1.32 \n\nnumerical aperture) and the floras of Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1986, 1988, 1991a, \n\n1991b) and Krammer (2000, 2001, 2009). The USA samples were also collected mostly from \n\nhard substrata with the methods described by Porter et al. (1993) and Moulton et al. (2002). \n\nIdentification and enumeration were done at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia \n\nwith the methods described by Charles et al. (2002). The AUS samples were collected from \n\nsoft and hard substrata, prepared with the methods described by Battarbee (1986) and \n\nmounted on microscope slides with Naphrax\u00ae. Identification and enumeration were done \n\nwith the procedures described in Philibert et al. (2006). The minimum number of valves per \n\nslide counted varied among countries: 600 in the USA, 400 in PORT and 200 in AUS. \n\nSeveral steps were undertaken to ensure the comparability of datasets: (1) taxa not \n\nidentified to species level were eliminated (e.g., Gomphonema sp.); (2) some Achnanthidium \n\nspecies that we considered to be morphologically similar to Achnanthidium minutissimum \n\n(K\u00fctzing) Czarnecki and that in the past were not separated from its complex were merged as \n\nA. minutissimum sensu lato (e.g., Achnanthidium atomoides Monnier, Lange-Bertalot &amp; Ector \n\nand Achnanthidium caravelense M. E. Novais &amp; L. Ector); (3) the varieties Achnanthes \n\nsubhudsonis var. kraeuselii (Cholnoky) Cholnoky and Achnanthes subhudsonis Hustedt were \n\nmerged at species level as A. subhudsonis; (4) the varieties of Cocconeis placentula Ehrenberg \n\n(e.g., Cocconeis placentula var. lineata (Ehrenberg) Van Heurck and Cocconeis placentula var. \n\neuglypta (Ehrenberg) Grunow) were all merged in a single species, C. placentula; and (5) two \n\nadditional datasets at higher taxonomic levels (genus and order) were created from the \n\nspecies dataset and the same statistical analyses were performed for the three datasets. \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n176 \n\n7.2.3 Data analyses \n\nAnalyses were performed on presence-absence data for each site at the three taxonomic \n\nlevels (order, genus and species).  \n\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS; Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure) was performed to \n\ndetermine whether diatom assemblages differed among regions. Inter-regional statistical \n\ndifferences were tested with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) \n\nglobal tests (unrestricted permutations). PERMANOVA pairwise tests (unrestricted \n\npermutations) were performed to assess which regions differed from each other. Similarity \n\npercentages analysis (SIMPER; Bray-Curtis similarity) was used to determine the most \n\nrepresentative taxa of each region (those contributing the most to the average similarity \n\nwithin groups) and to determine the taxa that contributed the most to Bray-Curtis \n\ndissimilarity among regions. These analyses were performed with the PRIMER 6 &amp; \n\nPERMANOVA software (PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK; Clarke and Gorley, 2006; Anderson et \n\nal., 2008). \n\nThe frequencies of the five most representative taxa of each region (from SIMPER \n\nanalyses) were compared among regions through one-way ANOVA tests (SigmaPlot 12.0 \n\nsoftware). When normality and equal-variance tests failed, Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way ANOVA \n\ntests (ANOVA on ranks) were used. ANOVAs were followed by pairwise comparisons (Dunn's \n\nMethod) to assess which regions differed in the percentage of sites where the taxa were \n\nfound. \n\nA graphical representation of the mean number of species per sample was performed to \n\nassess whether a variable number of samples per site could have contributed to differences \n\namong regions. Inter-regional statistical differences were assessed with one-way ANOVA \n\ntests (SigmaPlot 12.0 software) as described above. \n\n7.3 Results \n\n7.3.1 Species-level \n\nThe analysis included 634 diatom species. The assemblages of the PORT, USA and AUS \n\nregions differed significantly overall (Pseudo-F = 23.00, p &lt;0.01) and in all pairwise \n\ncomparisons (p &lt;0.01). The USA assemblages were most similar to the PORT ones (average \n\nsimilarity of 23.9%), while the AUS assemblages were the most segregated (average \n\ndissimilarity of 85.0% and 84.4% with PORT and USA, respectively) (Figure 7.1). Diatom \n\nrichness per sample was lower in Australian streams than in the other two regions (Figure \n\n7.2). \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n177 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.1 - Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of the diatom assemblages, at species level, of the \n\nthree regions: Portugal (triangles), United States of America (circles) and Australia (squares). \n\nThe species Achnanthidium minutissimum, Gomphonema parvulum (K\u00fctzing) K\u00fctzing, \n\nCocconeis placentula, Fragilaria vaucheriae (K\u00fctzing) J. B. Petersen and Encyonema minutum \n\n(Hilse) D. G. Mann contributed the most to average assemblage similarity within the PORT \n\nrivers, with contributions ranging from 5.2 to 10.9% (Table 7.1). A. minutissimum, Eolimna \n\nminima (Grunow) Lange-Bertalot &amp; W. Schiller, C. placentula, Planothidium frequentissimum \n\n(Lange-Bertalot) Lange-Bertalot and G. parvulum contributed the most to average similarity \n\nin the USA (Table 7.1; contributions between 3.0 and 4.0%). These results indicate that these \n\ntwo regions were dominated by circumneutral to alkaliphilous, freshwater species (occurring \n\nat &lt;500 mg Cl-/L) and by species with high to low oxygen requirements. In AUS, the species \n\nthat contributed most to average similarity were Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (C. Agardh) \n\nLange-Bertalot, Amphora pediculus (K\u00fctzing) Grunow ex. A. Schmidt, C. placentula, Nitzschia \n\ninconspicua Grunow and Tabularia fasciculata (C. Agardh) D. M. Williams &amp; Round, with \n\npercentage contributions ranging from 5.9 to 13.0 (Table 7.1). This list includes alkaliphilous, \n\nfresh-brackish (&lt;500 mg Cl-/L) to brackish (1000-5000 mg Cl-/L) species and species with \n\nfairly high (above 75% saturation) to moderate (above 50% saturation) oxygen \n\nrequirements. In comparison with the other two regions, the USA had small percentage \n\ncontributions from all species and thus more species represented in 90% of cumulative \n\ncontribution (Table 7.1). \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n178 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.2 - Mean number (\u00b1SD) of species per sample in the three regions (PORT-Portugal, USA-\n\nUnited States of America, AUS-Australia). Regions with the same letter (a, b) do not differ significantly \n\n(p > 0.05). \n\nOf the five species that contributed the most to within-USA similarity, Eolimna minima \n\nwas the only one that was significantly more frequent in the USA (Figure 7.3). None of the five \n\nspecies that contributed most to within-PORT similarity was significantly more frequent in \n\nPORT (Figure 7.3), and all were equally frequent, or more frequent (E. minima) in the USA. Of \n\nthe five species that contributed most to within-AUS similarity, only Tabularia fasciculata was \n\nsignificantly more frequent in that region. The remainder were all similarly frequent in the \n\nAUS and USA regions (Figure 7.3). The species Rhoicosphenia abbreviata, Amphora pediculus \n\nand Nitzschia inconspicua were more frequent in the USA and AUS than in PORT. From the set \n\nof species contributing most to within-group average similarity it is possible to verify a \n\ngreater proximity of the USA-AUS and USA-PORT assemblages and a greater distance \n\nbetween the PORT and AUS ones.  \n\nThe species Achnanthidium pyrenaicum (Hustedt) H. Kobayasi, Fragilaria capucina \n\nDesmazi\u00e8res, Mayamaea atomus var. permitis (Hustedt) Lange-Bertalot and Fistulifera \n\nsaprophila (Lange-Bertalot &amp; Bonik) Lange-Bertalot were found only in PORT and included in \n\nthose that contributed most to average dissimilarity among regions (Table 7.2). In the USA, \n\nthe unique species that contributed to average dissimilarity were Navicula viridulacalcis \n\nLange-Bertalot, Gomphonema subclavatum (Grunow) Grunow and Sellaphora mutata \n\n(Krasske) Lange-Bertalot. The species Navicymbula (=Cymbella) pusilla (Grunow) Krammer, \n\nNitzschia liebethruthii Rabenhorst, Nitzschia perspicua Cholnoky and Rhopalodia musculus \n\n(K\u00fctzing) O. M\u00fcller were found only in AUS. The higher average dissimilarity between PORT \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n179 \n\nand AUS was due to differences in species frequencies and to species that were found only in \n\nPORT (Table 7.2). Rhoicosphenia abbreviata, Tabularia fasciculata, Amphora pediculus and \n\nNitzschia inconspicua contributed to the dissimilarity between PORT and AUS (up to 18% \n\ncumulative) by being more frequent in AUS, while Fragilaria vaucheriae, Encyonema \n\nminutum, Eolimna minima, Planothidium frequentissimum, Gomphonema parvulum and \n\nNitzschia palea (K\u00fctzing) W. Smith were more frequent in PORT. The dissimilarity between \n\nthe USA and AUS was also due to differences in species frequencies and to species that were \n\nfound only in the USA (Table 7.2); the species that contributed most (up to 18% cumulative) \n\nwere all more frequent in the USA with the exception of T. fasciculata. Once again, E. minima, \n\nP. frequentissimum, E. minutum, F. vaucheriae and G. parvulum were among those species. \n\nThese species were not among those that contributed most to the average dissimilarity \n\nbetween PORT and USA (e.g., R. abbreviata, Sellaphora pupula (K\u00fctzing) Mereschkowksy, N. \n\ninconspicua, Melosira varians C. Agardh). \n\nTable 7.1 - Diatom species that contributed most to average assemblage similarity in PORT-Portugal, \n\nUSA-United States of America and AUS-Australia (up to 90% of cumulative contribution, Bray\u2013Curtis \n\nsimilarity: SIMPER analysis).

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n188 \n\n7.3.2 Genus-level \n\nThe datasets included 98 diatom genera. The assemblages differed significantly among \n\nregions at genus level (Pseudo-F = 32.25, p &lt;0.01) and all three regions differed from each \n\nother (p &lt;0.01). The AUS assemblages were again most segregated but less so than at species \n\nlevel (average dissimilarity of 63.5% and 62.9% from PORT and USA, respectively) (Figure \n\n7.4). The mean number of genera per site in the USA did not differ significantly from the \n\nnumbers in either PORT or AUS, but PORT had significantly more genera than AUS (Figure \n\n7.5).  \n\n \nFigure 7.4 - Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of the diatom assemblages, at the genus level, of \n\nthe three regions: Portugal (triangles), United States of America (circles) and Australia (squares). \n\nThe five genera that contributed most to similarity within Portuguese streams were \n\nGomphonema, Achnanthidium, Navicula, Nitzschia and Fragilaria, with percentage \n\ncontributions ranging from 10.4 to 8.9 (Table 7.3). Five of the genera that contributed most to \n\nwithin-USA similarity were also found in PORT with a higher percentage contribution \n\n(Gomphonema, Fragilaria, Achnanthidium, Nitzschia and Navicula). The exceptions were the \n\ngenera Encyonema and Eolimna which had similar frequencies in PORT and the USA (Figure \n\n7.6). The five genera that contributed most to within-AUS similarity were Nitzschia, Navicula, \n\nRhoicosphenia, Planothidium and Amphora, two of which (Navicula and Nitzschia) were also \n\namong those that contributed most to average similarity within other regions. Although \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n189 \n\nRhoicosphenia, Planothidium and Amphora were not among the five most genera contributing \n\nmost to similarity within the USA (or PORT), they were equally frequent in the USA and AUS \n\n(Figure 7.6). Frequencies of the selected genera were always significantly different between \n\nPORT and AUS, except for Planothidium. \n\nThe average dissimilarity was lowest between PORT and the USA (50.7 %), with the \n\ngenera contributing most (up to 18%) to this dissimilarity all more frequent in the USA than \n\nin PORT (e.g., Rhoicosphenia, Amphora, Melosira, Aulacoseira, Frustulia and Surirella). \n\nAlthough AUS had comparable average dissimilarity to each of the other two regions, only \n\none genus was present in AUS and absent from PORT, and only one was present in PORT and \n\nabsent from AUS, whereas eight were absent from AUS and present in the USA (e.g., Reimeria \n\nand Stauroneis) (Table 7.4). The main difference between PORT and AUS (and the USA) was \n\nin genera frequencies. There was a higher frequency of genera such as Rhoicosphenia, \n\nAmphora, Tabularia, Bacillaria and Tryblionella in AUS while in PORT there was a higher \n\nfrequency of Encyonema, Fragilaria, Eolimna, Gomphonema and Ulnaria. \n\n \nFigure 7.5 - Mean number (\u00b1SD) of genera per sample in the three regions (PORT-Portugal, USA-United \n\nStates of America, AUS-Australia).

Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n192 \n\n7.3.3 Order-level \n\nThe datasets included 19 diatom orders. At order level the assemblages of the three \n\nregions again differed significantly overall (Pseudo-F = 28.99, p &lt;0.01) and in all pairwise \n\ncomparisons (p &lt;0.01). Once more, the diatom assemblages from Australia were segregated \n\nfrom the others (Figure 7.7). However, in contrast to the other taxonomic levels, the PORT \n\nand AUS regions had similar numbers of orders per sample (Figure 7.8) whereas the USA had \n\nfewer orders per sample than PORT.  \n\n \nFigure 7.7 - Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) of the diatom assemblages, at the order level, of \n\nthe three regions: Portugal (triangles), United States of America (circles) and Australia (squares). \n\nThe orders that contributed the most to assemblage similarity within PORT were \n\nCocconeidales, Naviculales and Cymbellales with percentage contributions up to 16% (Table \n\n7.5). The percentage contributions of the orders found in the USA were fairly uniform and the \n\norders with greatest contributions were the same in PORT and USA (Table 7.5). Therefore, \n\nthe dissimilarity between PORT and USA was just 27.7%. The orders that contributed the \n\nmost to similarity within AUS were Cymbellales, Naviculales, Bacillarialles, Cocconeidales, \n\nand Licmophorales (Table 7.5). The order Licmophorales was among those contributing most \n\nto within-region similarity only in AUS, but was always among those contributing to most the \n\ndissimilarity among regions. Despite the lack of statistical differences, the PORT assemblages \n\nhad a lower frequency of Licmophorales (Figure 7.9). The order Fragilariales was the only \n\norder with significantly lower frequency in AUS (Figure 7.9).  \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n193 \n\nNo order contributed to average dissimilarity by being present in just one region; the \n\ninter-regional dissimilarities were due only to differences in frequencies. The orders \n\ncontributing up to 10% to the dissimilarity between AUS and the other two regions were \n\nThalassiophysales and Tabellariales (AUS-PORT) and Eunotiales and Tabellariales (AUS-\n\nUSA). \n\n \nFigure 7.8 - Mean number (\u00b1SD) of orders per sample found in the three regions (PORT-Portugal, USA-\n\nUnited States of America, AUS-Australia).

Licmophorales was not significantly different between USA \n\nand AUS but the differences were not tested for the other two comparisons (PORT-USA and PORT-\n\nAUS). \n\n7.4 Discussion \n\nWe expected similar assemblages from rivers with similar climate (Csb) in a large-scale \n\ncomparison among regions on different continents. However, significant differences among \n\nregions were found even at the lowest level of taxonomic resolution (order). These results \n\nmay suggest that, as stated by Gaston (2000), no single mechanism adequately explains a \n\ngiven large-scale pattern of biodiversity. Instead, constraints other than climate are likely to \n\nhave contributed to the inter-regional differences in diatom assemblage composition found at \n\nall taxonomic levels, e.g., geology, historical biogeographic processes and hydrology \n\n(Stevenson, 1997; Virtanen and Soininen, 2012). Those other constraints were probably \n\nlarge-scale because such marked assemblage differences should not result from constraints \n\nacting at the local scale (such as micro-habitats), which would be reflected only in variability \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n195 \n\namong sites within each region . Also, if micro-scale factors had a strong effect, the samples \n\nfrom the different regions would have been mixed or grouped by similarities in micro-scale \n\nconditions, which was not observed.  \n\nDiatoms are known to respond strongly to ion concentrations (Potapova and Charles, \n\n2003) and pH (Almeida and Feio, 2012), and these variables are usually related to catchment \n\ngeology. Therefore, if diatom assemblages of the different regions were structured by \n\ngeology, regional differences in ionic and pH preferences of the assemblages would be \n\nexpected. The environmental preferences of the species that contributed most to dissimilarity \n\namong regions indicate that the geologies of the Portuguese and USA regions are probably \n\nsimilar and different from the geology of the Australian region. The Portuguese and USA \n\ndiatom assemblages were dominated by circumneutral (mainly occurring at pH values about \n\n7) to alkaliphilous (mainly occurring at pH > 7) and oligohalobous (occurring at >100 to &lt;\n\n500 mg Cl-/L) species, whereas the Australia diatom assemblages included more alkaliphilous \n\n(pH >7) and salinity-tolerant species (>100 to 5000 mg Cl-/L; van Dam et al., 1994). For \n\nexample, Tabularia fasciculata, a representative taxon of the Australian assemblages, is \n\nassociated with lowland streams with a pH ranging from 6.8 to 8.6, with relatively high \n\nsalinities (Blinn and Bailey, 2001) and high conductivities (optimum of 719 \u00b5S/cm; Potapova \n\nand Charles, 2003). On the other hand, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata and Nitzschia inconspicua \n\nwere among the species that contributed most to the dissimilarity between Portugal and the \n\nUSA, but were equally frequent in USA and Australian assemblages. These species prefer \n\nwaters with high mineral content, and have conductivity optima around 400 \u00b5S/cm \n\n(Potapova and Charles, 2003; Potapova et al., 2005; Rimet 2009; Feio et al., 2012). The region \n\nof western Victoria (close to the Australian study region) is known for having several lakes \n\nwith high salinity levels due to saline groundwater and runoff (Gell, 1997).  \n\nDespite this evidence of the likely importance of geology, the observed differences in \n\nrichness and assemblage composition among regions could also be related to biogeographical \n\nprocesses. Diatoms, like other microorganisms, have been considered ubiquitous with rare \n\nspecies not recorded globally simply because sampling effort has been insufficient (Finlay et \n\nal., 2002). In contrast to larger organisms such as macroinvertebrates (Heino and Soininen, \n\n2007), diatoms may be easily distributed via wind, currents and animal vectors (e.g., \n\nKristiansen, 1996), resulting in wider distributions than those of metazoans (e.g., Heino and \n\nSoininen, 2007; Finlay et al., 2002). For example, in a recent study of assemblage variation of \n\ndiatoms, bryophytes and macroinvertebrates across the same set of sites, variation was more \n\nassociated with environmental factors and less associated with geographical distance for \n\ndiatoms than for the other assemblages (Astorga et al., 2012). However, in recent years, some \n\nlarge-scale studies (Potapova and Charles, 2002; Soininen, 2004; Soininen et al., 2004) have \n\ndemonstrated that purely spatial factors may also influence diatom distribution patterns \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n196 \n\n(Virtanen and Soininen, 2012), even at the genus level (Vyverman et al., 2007). Also, the \n\nincreasing incidence of apparent regional endemism indicates the prevalence of restricted \n\ndistribution patterns among diatom species (Vyverman et al., 2007; Vanormelingen et al., \n\n2008; Verleyen et al., 2009; Vyverman et al., 2010). Moreover, human-mediated introductions \n\nprovide a strong indication that geographic dispersal is limited (Vanormelingen et al. 2008). \n\nRecognised introduced diatom species include Achnanthes subhudsonis in Europe (Coste and \n\nEctor, 2000), Asterionella formosa in New Zealand (Harper, 2004 in Vanormelingen et al., \n\n2008) and Didymosphenia geminata in New Zealand (Blanco and Ector, 2009). According to \n\nCoste and Ector (2000), A. subhudsonis was initially described in East Africa in 1921 and was \n\nfirst reported in Europe in 1991 (Galicia, NW Spain). Despite being reported in the Southern \n\nHemisphere in 2000 (Coste and Ector, 2000), it is still apparently apparent absent from \n\nAustralia. \n\nWe expected that if dispersal limitation and geographic distance were shaping diatom \n\nassemblages, the Australian ones would be the most distinct, because Australia is \n\ngeographically distant from the other two regions, and this was indeed the case. Moreover, \n\nsome species were found only in one region, a result suggesting biogeographic patterns. \n\nHowever, the great majority of the species that were absent from a region in this study were \n\nfound in the same country by other authors (e.g., Blinn and Bailey, 2001; Chessman et al., \n\n2007; Potapova and Charles, 2007). Therefore, these species can be considered ubiquitous, \n\ni.e. organisms without biogeography (Soininen, 2007).  \n\nAccording to Bouchard et al. (2004), biogeographical patterns are more distinct at the \n\ngenus level. In our study, differences among regions were evident even at the order level, \n\nwith the Australian assemblages being consistently most distinct. However, as the \n\nordinations show, distinctions among regions declined from species to genus to order. This \n\nresult is expected because a higher taxon will usually have a broader distribution than each of \n\nits constituent lower taxa. Our results also show that even small differences among \n\nassemblages can be detected at the order level. For example, the order Licmophorales \n\ncontributed strongly to dissimilarity among regions and similarity within the Australian \n\nassemblages despite comprising only the species Tabularia fasciculata.  \n\nBouchard et al. (2004) have warned that taxonomic richness should be compared among \n\nstudies with caution, as richness depends greatly on search effort and sample size. In our \n\nstudy, the databases from each of the three regions comprised a different number of samples \n\nper site, which could have influenced taxonomic richness. However, Portugal and Australia \n\nhad a similar number of samples per site, yet Portuguese samples had more species (and \n\ngenera). This result suggests that the lower richness found in Australia was not related to the \n\nnumber of samples. Species richness has also been related to latitude, with tropical zones \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n197 \n\nsupporting more species than temperate ones (Hawkins et al., 2004). However, this issue \n\ndoes not apply to our study because the regions we included are at similar latitudes. Regional \n\ninconsistencies in identification could also have contributed to differences at the species \n\nlevel, but the differences remained at genus and order levels where identification problems \n\nare unlikely. Finally, differences in richness may have been related to the number of valves \n\ncounted per sample in each region. However, a study by Bate and Newall (2002) comparing \n\nvalve counts of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 found that 200 were sufficient to characterise the \n\ndiatom assemblage at a site with an efficiency of 80%. \n\n7.5 Conclusion \n\nIn summary, our study has demonstrated that streams from different regions with \n\nsimilar climate (Csb) have diatom assemblages with differing taxonomic composition, and \n\nthat climate cannot be used to map diatom distribution, in contrast to distributions of other \n\norganisms (Lindsay and Bayoh, 2004). The clear patterns obtained at all taxonomic levels \n\nsuggest that regional differences are related to large-scale constraints. In addition, our results \n\nconfirm that in large-scale studies it is possible to detect statistical differences among diatom \n\nassemblages at a high taxonomical rank such as genus or even order. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nAUS Australia \n\nMDS non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \n\nPORT Portugal \n\nUSA United States of America \n\n \n\nAcknowledgment \n\nThis study was made possible by financial support from the FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE \n\nAND TECHNOLOGY (Portugal) through the strategic project UID/MAR/04292/2013 granted \n\nto MARE, UID/GEO/04035/2013 granted to GeoBioTec and the Ph.D. scholarship \n\nSFRH/BD/68973/2010 of the first author.

Polar Science 4, 103-113. doi:10.1016/j.polar.2010.03.006 \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n205 \n\nChapter 8 - Final remarks \n\n\u2018The river is like an organism; it is internally self-adjusting\u2019 (Leopold, 1977). It is also \n\nresilient and can absorb changes imposed upon it, but not without limit (Leopold, 1977). The \n\nlimit beyond which a river cannot adjust has been in many situations overcome by man to a \n\npoint that, even to the casual observer, it is rather obvious that undisturbed conditions can no \n\nlonger exist (Birk et al., 2012).  \n\nStreams and rivers exhibit different environmental characteristics from one region to \n\nanother as a consequence of differences in climate, geology, hydromorphology, channel \n\nsubstrate, and water chemistry. Even within the small geographic area covered in this work \n\n(the Portuguese littoral region), it was possible to differentiate three sub-groups of streams \n\nbased on differences in mean annual precipitation, mean annual runoff, slope, altitude, size of \n\nthe drainage area, lithology, and stream substrate (chapter 2). Major anthropogenic \n\nalterations were, as expected, related to the riparian vegetation, morphological condition, and \n\nsediment load, as the main pressures in the Portuguese littoral region are agriculture and \n\ndeforestation (chapter 2). Due to this strong anthropogenic influence it was only possible to \n\nfind sites in Least Disturbed Condition (LDC), which corresponded to only 14.7% of the total \n\nsamples collected. Nevertheless, the nutrient concentrations obtained for littoral LDC were \n\nstill high and sites in the larger rivers included in this work were even excluded, due to \n\nhydromorphological modifications, specifically in the hydrological regime, connectivity, \n\nand/or morphological alterations. From the selected least disturbed sites, two distinct diatom \n\ncommunities (two sub-groups) were found (chapter 2), being differentiated by mean annual \n\nrunoff, slope, mean annual precipitation, substrate (stone vs. sand), and lithology of the \n\nstreams.  \n\nThe two sub-groups of diatom communities that were under similar levels of \n\nanthropogenic disturbance yielded considerable differences in the median values of the \n\nPortuguese official diatom index (Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique - IPS). The sub-group \n\nof streams with stony substrate showed much higher IPS median value than the group \n\ncorresponding to sandy substrate. Therefore, the use of a single IPS benchmark value for both \n\nsub-groups to calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) values would lead to erroneous \n\nclassifications. The division by a higher median than the official one, which was based in a \n\nmixture of different littoral sites, results in lower EQRs, and therefore potential erroneous \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n206 \n\nattribution of lower quality to sites with good quality. These Type II errors (false negatives) \n\ncan have important consequences, as they imply a higher investment than the one needed for \n\nstreams\u2019 restoration (Johnson et al., 2006).  \n\nIn spite of all efforts to increase the number of LDC sites in the Portuguese littoral \n\nregion, through higher density of sampling sites and the refinement of the benchmark \n\ncriteria, the strong anthropogenic pressures prevent an adequate definition of reference \n\nconditions for this area based on reference sites. Thus, an alternative procedure to the \n\ndefinition of reference conditions was investigated in chapter 3. To address problems of this \n\ntype, Chessman and Royal (2004) proposed an alternative approach (filters approach) \n\nthrough which the establishment of biological reference conditions does not rely on reference \n\nsites. In fact, this approach, in combination with the modelling of the undisturbed condition of \n\nabiotic reference values, enabled us to propose biological reference conditions for the studied \n\nregion, for both diatoms and macroinvertebrates, with lower dependence on reference sites. \n\nYet, some of the abiotic variables that we considered relevant were not possible to model \n\nbased on the existing data through boosted trees. The reference maximum nitrate \n\nconcentration for reference sites was 3.64 mg\u00b7L-1, which is within the range of threshold \n\nvalues for various river types (2-6 mg\u00b7L-1) below which Pardo et al. (2012) considered a site \n\nto be \u2018probably reference\u2019. Feio et al. (2014) set a lower threshold for Mediterranean areas (? \n\n1.15 mg\u00b7L-1), but it was based on much a wider geographic region than the lowland area \n\nconsidered in this study.  \n\nThe use of the abiotic reference values (from models and from the literature) in \n\ncombination with the filter approach allowed the prediction of diatom and macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities statistically different from those that were observed in the streams during this \n\nstudy (chapter 3). We also verified that the communities observed in the streams were less \n\nhomogeneous than those predicted (through the filter approach), as would be expected with \n\nsites having variable levels of change from reference conditions. Macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities were also included in parallel in the analysis as they are the most commonly \n\nused biotic indicator of streams ecological quality. For both diatoms and macroinvertebrates, \n\nthe median number of taxa predicted was more than the double of the median number of taxa \n\nobserved, probably reflecting the long-term elimination of taxa by anthropogenic pressures \n\n(chapter 3). In some cases, taxa were observed at a site where they were not predicted to \n\noccur which could indicate anthropogenic influences turning a stream suitable for taxa that \n\nwould not naturally occur there. However, it could also have resulted from limitations in \n\nestimating the natural environmental attributes of the sites and the environmental tolerance \n\nranges of the taxa (Chessman and Royal, 2004).  \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n207 \n\nWe argue that this approach (combination of modelling and filter approach) is suitable \n\nto deal with the implications of global changes on diatoms, and even on macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunities, because, among the filters that were most often responsible for exclusions of \n\ndiatom and macroinvertebrate taxa, we found mean annual temperature and runoff. These \n\nvariables were considered to influence both diatom and macroinvertebrate distributions in \n\nother studies a (e.g., Potapova and Charles, 2002; Rimet et al., 2004; Tison et al., 2005; Feio et \n\nal., 2007; Rimet, 2009; Hawkins et al., 2010; Almeida and Feio, 2012). As expected, the \n\npressure variables treated as filters excluded few taxa when set to normal values in the \n\nabsence of anthropogenic influence (reference values). That is, when we \u2018eliminate\u2019 the effect \n\nof global changes from the environment, less taxa are excluded from streams that have \n\nnatural abiotic characteristics to support those taxa. In spite of their importance, some of our \n\nfilters are not direct determinants of diatom and macroinvertebrate community composition \n\nbut rather surrogate predictors (Clarke et al., 2003). For example, mean annual air \n\ntemperature, as obtained from cartographic sources, was used here as a surrogate of water \n\ntemperature and was responsible for the total exclusion of Frustulia erifuga and frequent \n\nexclusion of Melosira varians from the diatom reference lowland communities. Direct \n\nprediction from the annual range of water temperature would have been more desirable, but \n\nwater temperature is also highly dependent on the measurement spot and would require \n\ntemperature loggers to be used continuously (Clarke et al., 2003). \n\nTo test the consequences of the predictions through the filter approach to the ecological \n\nquality assessment, we developed a new multimetric diatom index (the MDI), following an \n\napproach similar to the one used for macroinvertebrates. This new index included the IPS as \n\na metric and also the number of sensitive taxa and total taxa richness (chapter 3). We verified \n\nthat the MDI produced strong correlations with the pressure variables thus providing a more \n\ncomprehensive assessment of biological quality than the IPS (significant correlations with \n\ntwo PCA axes vs. only one axis). Such better performance was probably due to the inclusion of \n\nthe number of sensitive species, as indicated by the high correlation of this metric with the \n\nPCA axes. In result of the application of the new reference values, the LDC sites decreased \n\ntheir EQR values, which was expectable. The comparison of the diatom and \n\nmacroinvertebrate assessment results gave more confidence to our results (chapter 3): the \n\nresults were similar for both communities and the new MDI resulted in similar water quality \n\nassessment than the already developed and highly used Portuguese multimetric index for \n\nbenthic macroinvertebrates (IPtIs).  \n\nConsidering the differences found in chapter 2 regarding the IPS median values for \n\nsandy and stony streams, it was found important to test the real importance of the colonizing \n\nsubstrate (small-scale) on the diatom communities and its implication in bioassessment \n\n(chapter 6) as diatom communities are influenced by different spatial scales (from single \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n208 \n\nsand grains to across continents) (Biggs, 1996). The results of the mesocosm experiment \n\ndescribed in chapter 6 showed that the substrate affects diatom communities by changing its \n\ncomposition and trait proportions. This is in agreement with other studies which indicate \n\ndifferences in the composition of diatom communities among different substrates (Round, \n\n1991; Cattaneo et al., 1997; Potapova and Charles, 2005). Yet, contrary to these findings, \n\nother in situ studies have not found differences between substrates (Rothfritz et al., 1997; \n\nBere and Tundisi, 2011; Winter and Duthie, 2000). In fact, the differences that we found in \n\nthe epipsammic and epilithic diatom communities in the streams (chapter 2) were more \n\nevident than the ones found in the mesocosm experiment (chapter 6). Furthermore, \n\nconsidering the water quality assessment, the IPS values obtained at the same sampling \n\nmoment in the channels did not reflect the multivariate differences between the epipsammic \n\nand epilithic diatom communities (chapter 6) neither those verified in the streams (chapter \n\n2). However, as in other studies, the results of the mesocosm experiments suggest that hard \n\nand soft (sand) substrates can be exchangeable in assessment methods that are based on \n\nautoecology (Soininen and K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, 2004; Potapova and Charles, 2005; Mendes et al., 2012). \n\nIn chapter 2 it was stated that due to the small number of LDC sites, particularly for \n\nepipsammic diatom communities, we must be cautious in our interpretations. With the \n\nresults of chapter 6 we verified that in fact under the same physical and chemical conditions \n\nthe IPS differences between substrates disappeared. Therefore, the differences that were \n\nfound in the streams may have been due to other differences in the physical or chemical \n\nproperties of the water that were not detected in the water analyses but were reflected in the \n\ndiatom communities.  \n\nWhile chapters 2 and 3 focused on the effect of anthropogenic disturbances in aquatic \n\ncommunities, particularly diatoms, chapter 4 and 5 dealt with the effect that can be expected \n\nfrom future extreme events due to climate changes. We verified that traits, community \n\ncomposition and bioassessment classifications of the diatoms and macroinvertebrates were \n\nall influenced by the complete drying of stream channels caused by an unusual drought event \n\naffecting the Portuguese littoral region during autumn and winter 2011/2012. However, the \n\nmacroinvertebrates and diatoms differed in their recovery response. The drought led to \n\nchanges in the trait proportions of the diatom and macroinvertebrate communities for at \n\nleast a 6-month period (chapter 4). Diatom trait proportions changed towards proportions \n\nsimilar to those found in Mediterranean communities. However, shortly after the return of \n\nwater to the channel, diatom communities\u2019 traits were similar to those observed before the \n\ndrought (chapter 4). The post-drought macroinvertebrate communities were however very \n\ndifferent from those found before the drought but were also different from the \n\nMediterranean ones (chapter 4). These changes in macroinvertebrate communities should \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n209 \n\nlead to an alteration of the ecosystem functioning for a relatively long period. For example, \n\nprimary production may have been higher than normal due to the absence of some grazers \n\nand scrapers that were not able to resist to drought, as the primary producers recovered \n\nfaster. Therefore, the lack of top-down control may have interfered in transference of energy \n\nand matter across the food chains.  \n\nThe influence of the drought in the water quality was more evident with the \n\nmacroinvertebrate assessment as the IPS index for diatoms was similar over the rewetting \n\nprogression. The stream water quality, given by the macroinvertebrate IPtI index, decreased \n\nwith the drought event, and although it did not attain the pre-drought values within one year, \n\nthe streams gradually recovered during the winter season. Both communities provide \n\nreliable information on water quality (e.g., Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002; Rimet et al., 2005). \n\nDiatoms are more sensitive to changes in water chemistry, whereas macroinvertebrates are \n\nmore susceptible to channel morphological changes and habitat conditions (Passy et al., \n\n2004). Under drought effects, their simultaneous use for bioassessment should be \n\nconsidered, as their responses are different and appear to be complementary (Feio et al., \n\n2007), particularly if one considers responses at different time scales.  \n\nBoth chapters 4 and 5 suggest that the predicted drought events due to climatic changes \n\ninfluence diatom and macroinvertebrate communities. With increasing anthropogenic \n\npressures and climatic alterations, we expect biological communities of temperate streams to \n\nchange through time towards pollution-tolerant taxa with higher resilience to extreme \n\ndrought events. Also, the river habitat characteristics appeared to play an important role in \n\nthe recovery of macroinvertebrate and diatom communities. This study showed that the \n\ninitial condition of streams was important in the recovery process, as the communities of \n\nstreams showing better environmental conditions (e.g., riparian corridors, Habitat Quality \n\nAssessment) recovered faster and easier from extreme disturbances, which is in agreement \n\nwith other studies (e.g., Sponseller et al., 2001; Elosegi et al., 2010; Thomson et al., 2012). \n\nIn chapter 6 we showed that there are variations in diatom communities in a small \n\nspatial scale (substrate). Yet, large spatial scales have not been sufficiently explored for \n\ndiatom communities. Thus, in chapter 7 we explored the plausible inter-continental (Europe, \n\nAmerica and Australia) influence on the diatom communities. Based on the collected data we \n\nalso found that diatom communities are different between regions with the same (temperate) \n\nclimate, suggesting that diatom assemblages are also influenced at the large-scale (chapter 7). \n\nInitially we expected similar communities from rivers with similar climate (Csb) at a large-\n\nscale level of comparison (inter-continents). However, significant differences between \n\nregions were found even at the highest level of taxonomical resolution (order). So, other than \n\nclimate constraints should have contributed to the differences found at all taxonomical levels \n\nin benthic algal communities structure (e.g., geology, historical biogeographic processes and \n\n\n\nEffect of global changes and spatial scale on diatom communities of temperate rivers. Dealing \n\nwith implications in bioassessment \n\n210 \n\nhydrology; Stevenson, 1997; Virtanen and Soininen, 2012). The differences could be due to \n\nother large-scale factors because such marked dissimilarities should not result from direct \n\nconstrains acting at the local and regional scale (as micro-habitats), which are only reflected \n\nin the variability between sites within each region. Also, if micro-scale factors had a strong \n\neffect, the samples from the different continents would be mixed or grouped by similarities in \n\nmicro-scale conditions, but this was not revealed by the collected data. \n\n \n\n \n\nFuture work \n\nHow to deal with the implications of global changes and spatial scale in bioassessment \n\nusing diatom communities of temperate rivers has not yet been completely understood. \n\nAlthough the effects of these factors on diatom communities and its implication in \n\nbioassessment were not fully addressed in the present work, our results can be combined in \n\ndifferent ways to achieve a much better insight over it. The experimental facilities developed \n\nduring this work can be used and/or further developed in the future to investigate a number \n\nof issues that has emerged. A selection of proposals for future work is: \n\nIssues based on the experimental facilities (artificial channels): \n\n-investigate the influence of temperature increase, based in the global warming \n\npredictions, on the water quality assessment based on diatom communities; \n\n-investigate the combined effects of the temperature and other important factors whose \n\neffects on the diatom communities can be potentiated by the temperature increase (e.g., \n\ntemperature/light conditions, temperature/consumers) on the diatom communities; \n\nIssues based on data obtained for this thesis: \n\n-investigate if the continental differences that were found at all taxonomical level are \n\nreflected in the water quality assessment. If these differences are not reflect in the water \n\nquality assessment streams and rivers from different continents but under reference \n\nconditions can be used as reference sites for other continents were references sites do no \n\nlonger exist. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations \n\nEQR Ecological Quality Ratios \n\nIPS Indice de Polluosensibilit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cifique \n\nIPtI \u00cdndice Portugu\u00eas de Invertebrados \n\nLDC Least Disturbed Condition \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n211 \n\nMDI Multimetric Diatom Index \n\nPCA Principal Components Analysis \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAlba-Tercedor, J., J\u00e1imez-Cu\u00e9llar, P., \u00c1lvarez, M., Avil\u00e9s, J., Bonada, N., Casas, J., Mellado, A., \n\nOrtega, M., Pardo, I., Prat, N., Rieradevall, M., Robles, S., S\u00e1inz Cantero, C.E., S\u00e1nchez-\n\nOrtega, A., Su\u00e1rez, M.L., Toro, M., Vida-Abarca, M.R., Vivas, S., Zamora-Mu\u00f1oz, C., 2002. \n\nCaracterizaci\u00f3n del estado ecol\u00f3gico de r\u00edos mediterr\u00e1neos ib\u00e9ricos mediante el \u00edndice \n\nIBMWP (antes BMWP').
