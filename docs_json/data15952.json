The intensification of agriculture \n\nproduction and shifts from extensive crop rotation have, regularly, a profound \n\nnegative effect on soils and their biodiversity. Biodiversity losses result in less \n\ncomplex soil communities. The increasing demand of soil ecosystem implies the \n\nimprovement of soil and crop management, and it\u2019s a key opportunity for \n\nsupporting sustainable economic development. The sustainable management \n\nof any ecosystem requires, amongst other information, a thorough \n\nunderstanding of plant-soil feedback attempting to describe natural patterns \n\nand relations between the plants and their environment. \n\nPlants produce organic substances by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis \n\ndepends upon the absorption of light by pigments, as chlorophyll-a among \n\nother accessory pigments, in the leaves of the plants. Therefore, leaf optical \n\nproperties are influenced by the concentration of the photosynthetic pigments, \n\nmetabolites, water content, leaf structure and leaf anatomy. Hyperspectral \n\nreflectance in remote sensing has gained scientific and commercial importance \n\nbut still remains underdeveloped despite its potential. Vegetation remote \n\nsensing is a great tool, as it can extrapolate to synoptic scales and time \n\nsequences can be acquired. It is increasingly used for measurements of \n\nagricultural crop condition and also for plant-soil interactions. It is known that \n\nreflectance signal is sensitive to abiotic changes, but concerning biotic changes, \n\nthere are still several limitations. \n\nTherefore, was conducted a 9 weeks greenhouse bioassay with two \n\ndifferent crops, Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and Corn (Zea mays), three different \n\ntypes of soil management and six different treatments were applied. The \n\ntreatments applied were: the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, the nematode \n\nPratylenchus penetrans, the Gamma radiation, the nutrients, the R. solani with \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nnutrients and a control treatment. The types of management were the Biologic, \n\nthe Artificial Fertilizer and the Manure. In total were 3650 plants. \n\nSpectral reflectance data were collected with an ASD Fieldspec 3 \n\nspectrometer with an ASD plant-probe and leaf-clip device attached. One of \n\nthe objectives of the measurement was to monitor the differences between leaf \n\nreflectance over time. The spectral data was analyzed using vegetation indices. \n\nThe effects of soil biota were analyzed in a multivariate ANOVA analysis with \n\nplant species, soil regime and soil treatment.  \n\nThe total biomass of the pathogens increase with a more intensive \n\nagriculture and shoot biomass in both plant species increased with disposal of \n\nthe nutrient supply in the Biologic soil. The application of manure compost that is \n\nrich in nitrogen may have reduced soil-borne diseases. The lowest biomass was \n\nfound in the sterilized treatments suggesting that the soil biota has influenced \n\nthe plant performance. The best soil management had positive effect in growth \n\nof the plants. Disease suppression can be influenced by management practices. \n\nIt was demonstrated that plant spectral signatures changes due induced stress \n\nand soil type. The best soil regime overall in this study case was considered the \n\nBiologic type. \n\n \n\nKey words: Soil biodiversity; Sustainable management; Hyperspectral \n\nreflectance; Plant-soil interactions. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\nO solo e a sua biodiversidade s\u00e3o o motor de todos os sistemas de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o terrestres e servi\u00e7os de ecossistemas. A mudan\u00e7a na produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nagr\u00edcola de extensiva para intensiva tem um efeito negativo profundo nos solos \n\ne na sua biodiversidade. A perda de biodiversidade resulta em comunidades \n\ndo solo menos complexas. Com o aumento da procura dos servi\u00e7os dos \n\necossistemas, como o solo, existe a necessidade da melhoria da gest\u00e3o dos \n\nsolos e das produ\u00e7\u00f5es agr\u00edcolas. Esta melhoria pode trazer vantagens a n\u00edvel do \n\ndesenvolvimento de pr\u00e1ticas mais sustent\u00e1veis que contribuem para um \n\ndesenvolvimento econ\u00f3mico sustent\u00e1vel. A gest\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel de qualquer \n\necossistema requer, entre outras informa\u00e7\u00f5es, uma compreens\u00e3o completa da \n\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o solo-planta para tentar descrever padr\u00f5es naturais. \n\nAs plantas produzem subst\u00e2ncia org\u00e2nica atrav\u00e9s da fotoss\u00edntese. A \n\nfotos\u00edntese depende da absor\u00e7\u00e3o de luz pelos pigmentos fotossint\u00e9ticos \n\npresentes na folha. Portanto, as propriedades \u00f3ticas da folha s\u00e3o influenciadas \n\npela concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos pigmentos fotossint\u00e9ticos e metabolitos, do seu teor em \n\n\u00e1gua e da estrutura e anatomia da folha.  \n\nA reflect\u00e2ncia hiperspectral tem ganho import\u00e2ncia comercial e \n\ncient\u00edfica, contudo, permanece ainda subdesenvolvida apesar do seu \n\npotencial. A dete\u00e7\u00e3o remota da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma boa ferramenta, pois pode \n\nextrapolar escalas de tempo, e \u00e9 cada vez mais utilizada para perceber \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es planta-solo. Sabe-se que o sinal de reflect\u00e2ncia \u00e9 sens\u00edvel a \n\nmudan\u00e7as abi\u00f3ticas e bi\u00f3ticas, mas ainda h\u00e1 um longo caminho a percorrer.  \n\nConsequentemente, foi realizado durante nove semanas um bioensaio \n\ncom duas culturas diferentes, a Beterraba (Beta vulgaris) e o Milho (Zea mays). \n\nForam plantadas em tr\u00eas diferentes tipos de gest\u00e3o do solo e aplicados seis \n\ntipos de tratamentos. Os tratamentos aplicados foram: o fungo Rhizoctonia \n\nsolani, o nem\u00e1tode Pratylenchus penetrans, a radia\u00e7\u00e3o gama, os nutrientes, e \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\no fungo R. solani  com nutrientes e um controlo. Os tipos de gest\u00e3o que foram \n\naplicados foram o solo Biol\u00f3gico, os fertilizantes artificiais e Fertelizantes \n\norg\u00e2nicos. No total foram consideradas 3650 plantas. \n\nOs dados da reflet\u00e2ncia espetral foram obtidos com um espectr\u00f3metro \n\nde campo ASD plant-probe e clip-foliar. Um objetivo deste estudo consistiu em \n\nmonitorizar a reflet\u00e2ncia espetral das folhas das duas esp\u00e9cies durante o \n\nper\u00edodo experimental. Os dados espetrais foram analisados utilizando \u00edndices \n\nde vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. Os efeitos do biota do solo foram analizados numa an\u00e1lise \n\nmultivariada ANOVA com os fatores, esp\u00e9cie de planta, tipos de solo e \n\ntratamentos. \n\nA biomassa total de patog\u00e9nicos tende a aumentar quanto mais \n\nintensiva for a pr\u00e1tica agricola. No solo Biol\u00f3gico observou-se uma \n\nintensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da cor verde da planta nas duas esp\u00e9cies, com o aumento da \n\ndisponibilidade de nutrientes. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o de fertelizante pode ter influenciado a \n\nresist\u00eancia das plantas \u00e0s doen\u00e7as do solo. A menor biomassa foi encontrada \n\nno tratamento com radia\u00e7\u00e3o gama (est\u00e9ril), sugerindo que o biota do solo \n\ninfluenciou o desempenho da planta. O melhor tipo de gest\u00e3o do solo teve um \n\nefeito positivo no crescimento das plantas. As melhores pr\u00e1ticas agricolas \n\npermitem uma supress\u00e3o das doen\u00e7as inoculadas. Foi demonstrado que o \n\nespetro da planta difere quando \u00e9 induzido stresse e tamb\u00e9m consoante o tipo \n\nde gest\u00e3o do solo. A melhor gest\u00e3o agr\u00edcola foi considerada a Biol\u00f3gica. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Biodiversidade do solo; Gest\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel; Reflet\u00e2ncia \n\nhiperspetral; Intera\u00e7\u00f5es planta-solo. \n\n  \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 -

The intensification of agriculture production and shifts from \n\nextensive crop rotation have a profound negative effect on soils and their \n\nbiodiversity (changing land use management) (Scherr and McNeely 2008; Hol \n\nand Hedlund 2010; Hedlund 2012). Biodiversity losses often result in a less \n\ncomplex soil community with frequently inhibited functions leading to a higher \n\nexposure to pathogens and natural enemies resulting in frequent disease \n\noutbreaks (Peterson et al. 1998; Folke et al. 2004; Garbeva et al. 2004; Neher \n\n2010). Soil organisms are mostly unseen but have a huge variety both in function \n\nand taxonomy. They interact in complex belowground foodwebs and feedback \n\ninto above-ground plant performance as well (e.g. due to their feeding \n\nactivities belowground)(Van der Putten et al. 2009; van Dam and Heil 2011). The \n\nincreasing demand of soil ecosystem services implies improving soil \n\nmanagement as a key opportunity for supporting sustainable economic \n\ndevelopment, prevent species loses and promote soil biodiversity (Tilman et al. \n\n2002; Zhang et al. 2007). Accurate knowledge of plant species distribution and \n\nfoodweb interactions is a critical component for soil management and \n\npreservation of biodiversity (Brussaard et al. 2007; Tylianakis et al. 2008). Hence, \n\nthe sustainable management of any ecosystem requires, amongst other \n\ninformation, a thorough understanding of plant-soil feedback to try to describe \n\nnatural patterns and relations between the plants and their environment. It \n\nbecomes, therefore, essential to improve our monitoring and management of \n\nsoil quality and crop production. \n\nRemote sensing sensors are increasingly used for measurements of the \n\nagricultural crop condition or also for plant soil interactions (Schmidt and \n\nSkidmore 2003; Mutanga and Skidmore 2004; Beck et al. 2008; Knox et al. 2010; \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n3 \n\n \n\nRamoelo et al. 2011). It is known that reflectance signal is sensitive to abiotic \n\nchanges (Wessman et al. 1988) but for the biotic changes there is a long way to \n\ngo (Carvalho et al. 2012). In this way this technology can also provide an \n\nautomatic and objective alternative to visual disease assessment of plant \n\ndiseases (Hillnh\u00fctter and Mahlein 2008; Mahlein et al. 2012). However,  leaf \n\noptical properties are influenced by the concentration of the photosynthetic \n\npigments, biochemicals, water content and leaf structure (de Boer 1993), which \n\nare themselves, influence by soil biotic communities and pathogens (Bever et al. \n\n1997; Hedlund et al. 2003; Wardle et al. 2004; de Vries and Bardgett 2012) as \n\neach stress can elicit cellular and molecular changes (Herms and Mattson 1992). \n\nRemote sensing is the major source of spatial information of the earth\u2019s surface \n\ncover from the local region to the globe (Graetz 1990). Hyperspectral remote \n\nsensing has gained scientific and commercial importance but still remains \n\nunderdeveloped (Schmidt and Skidmore 2003) despite its potential (Myers et al. \n\n1970; Thenkabail et al. 2000; Hillnh\u00fctter et al. 2011). In this thesis we aim at the \n\nstudy of these changes, using spectral data in a non-destructive method that \n\nhas the potential to be use in soil management and to monitor crop production \n\nin future approaches for precision agriculture. \n\n \n\n1 . 2  S o i l  b i o d i v e r s i t y  \n \n\nSoil biodiversity is defined as the variety of life found in soil, such as \n\ninvertebrates and microorganisms, soil flora, mammals, birds, reptiles and \n\namphibians. Soil communities are among the most species-rich areas in \n\nterrestrial ecosystems (Giller et al. 1997; Bardgett 2005; Brussaard et al. 2007). \n\nMost of the organisms inhabiting soil ecosystems are found within the top 10 cm \n\nof the soil profile, and there are many abiotic and biotic factors that influence \n\nthis diversity (Connell 1961; Wall and Moore 1999; Wardle et al. 2004). Some \n\nknown abiotic factors are the soil structure, soil texture, organic matter while \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n4 \n\n \n\nmain biotic factors are the interactions between organisms, their pathogens and \n\nsymbionts. \n\nSoil texture, organic matter and structure highly influence the biodiversity \n\nof plants and animals living on the soil. Soil texture is defined by the proportion of \n\nsand, silt and clay particles bound together by organic matter (Parton et al. \n\n1987; Bronick and Lal 2005). The percentage of organic matter found in soil has \n\na large influence on the adjacent biodiversity as it impacts soil fertility, soil \n\nstructure, workability and water holding capacity (Doran et al. 1996; Weil and \n\nMagdoff 2004). Soil biota has the function to degrade organic matter which will \n\nbe fixed by primary producers and the cycle of nutrients will flow (organic \n\nmatter is processed and the nutrients will be release into the environment \n\nbecoming available again for the primary producers)(Witkamp 1971; Lavelle \n\nand Berhe 2005). While degrading organic matter soil microbial biota activity \n\nproduces and consumes gases - carbon dioxide, methane, among others. - and \n\nsequestrates carbon into the soil maintaining the physical properties of the soil \n\n(Linn and Doran 1984; Lal 2004). Soil structure affects the stability of soil and its \n\nresistance to degradation under pressure. Resistance is defined as the capacity \n\nof a system to continue to function without change through a disturbance \n\n(Pimm 1984; Peterson et al. 1998; Folke et al. 2004; Garbeva et al. 2004). Another \n\n Figure 1 Graphical and mathematical description of resistance and resilience (Herrick and Wander 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n5 \n\n \n\nimportant of soil is resilience, defined as  the recovery of the functional integrity \n\nof a system following a disturbance (Pimm 1984) or catastrophic disturbance \n\n(Holling and Meffe 1996) relative to its original state (Fig. 1). Structure is \n\ninfluenced by texture, organic matter, compaction and biological activities. \n\nIn its biotic conditions, soil communities have the invertebrates and \n\nmicroorganisms as the majority of their biomass (Anderson et al. 1977; Ghilarov \n\n1977; Allen et al. 1979; Pimentel et al. 1980) . These include bacteria, fungi, \n\nprotozoa, nematodes, mites, collembola, oligochaetes (earthworms), myriapods \n\n(millipedes and centipedes), mollusks and insects (ants, termites, beetles). Soil \n\nbiodiversity communities are more resistant to changes in surrounding biotic and \n\nabiotic conditions (Elliott and Lynch 1994) as redundancy in an ecosystem is \n\nhigh. High redundancy allows one species to substitute another, such that \n\nfunctions are continuously achieved, even with the loss of one species (Mouillot \n\net al. 2013). With increased redundancy, soil ecosystems also have higher \n\nresistance to disturbances and are resilient to subsequent disturbances. As such, \n\nthe diversity of species found in soil communities impact soil quality and \n\nfunctioning, providing essential services in the stability of the abiotic \n\ncomponents of the soil. \n\nIn fact soil biodiversity is increasingly proposed as an integrative indicator \n\nof soil environmental quality, food security and economic viability, and it can be \n\nan ideal indicator of sustainable land management (Parr et al. 1992; Carter \n\n2002; Brussaard et al. 2007). In this thesis was considered the definition of \n\nsustainable management as \u201cThe capacity of a specific kind of soil to function \n\nwithin natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain biological \n\nproductivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and animal \n\nhealth\u201d as described by the Science Society of America (Karlen et al. 1997). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n6 \n\n \n\n 1 . 3  S o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e s   \n \n\nPlant disease development is a \n\ndynamic process involving living entities \n\n(the plant host and the pathogen) and \n\nthe environment (biotic and abiotic \n\ncomponents) with high impact in \n\nagriculture. The interaction between (a) \n\nbiotic factors in the soil can cause a \n\ndisease to break-out. This interaction can \n\nbe summarized in the \u201cdisease triangle\u201d \n\nconcept (Stevenson 1960) (Fig. 2). \n\nPathogens are the biological agents causing disease or illness in the host. \n\nThe soil borne pathogens can be defined as the pathogens that cause diseases \n\nvia inoculum (biological object, spore, mycelium, cells) that comes to the plant \n\nvia the soil (Koike et al. 2003). The most common symptom of soil borne \n\npathogens in plants is root rots that affect belowground tissues and vascular wilts \n\ninitiated through root infection (Grau et al. 2004). Sometimes presence of a \n\npathogen can be visible (mycelial growth, nematode cysts), or while, in other \n\nsituations, there are just symptoms visible but not the pathogen itself (root decay, \n\ncrowns rot, wilting foliage). So the manifestation of the symptoms caused by the \n\npathogen is the disease (Campbell and Madden 1990; Blok et al. 2000; Bailey \n\nand Lazarovits 2003). Soil biodiversity performs a number of vital functions that \n\nregulate the soil ecosystem, including decomposition of litter and cycling of \n\nnutrients such as nitrogen, carbon, among others (Coleman et al. 1993). These \n\nrenewal processes and ecosystem services are mainly biological, thus, their \n\npersistence depends upon maintenance of biological diversity (Altieri 1999). The \n\nsame biodiversity soil may generate \u201cpathogen suppressive\u201d conditions and \n\ngreater resistance to invasion. Pathogen control is another key ecosystem \n\nservice underpinned by biodiversity (Cardinale et al. 2012); it is greatly \n\nFigure 2 The equilateral plant disease triangle. \n\nThe three necessary causal factors of disease \n\nare positioned at the vertices (Francl 2001) \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n7 \n\n \n\ndetermined by the abundance of natural enemies of the pathogen species \n\ninvolved. Improved pest control is dependent on a diversity of natural enemies \n\nof pests, and non-crop habitats are often fundamental for the presence and \n\nsurvival of these biological control agents (predators, parasitoids)(Zhang et al. \n\n2007).  \n\nThere is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers protection against \n\nsoil-borne diseases, despite crop, soil type and management also playing a role \n\n(Brussaard et al. 2007). Therefore, natural pest regulation is considered an \n\nimportant service of biodiversity (Altieri 1999; Schl\u00e4pfer and Schmid 1999; Wilby \n\nand Thomas 2002b, a; Fiedler et al. 2008). Soil borne plant pathogens can \n\nsignificantly reduce yield and quality in vegetable crops (Abawi and Widmer \n\n2000). These pathogens are particularly challenging because they often survive \n\nin soil for many years and each crop may be susceptible to several species. \n\nInfections occurring at the same time from multiple soil-borne pathogens can \n\nresult in a complex disease that can further damage the crop. Almost all soil-\n\nborne pathogens are difficult to predict, to detect and to diagnose (Koike et al. \n\n2003). The soil environment is extremely complex, making it more difficult to \n\nunderstand the interaction between soil and diseases caused by this soil-borne \n\npathogens (Garbeva et al. 2004). They can broadly be divided into soil \n\ninhabitants, the one able to survive in soil for a relatively long time and soil \n\ninvaders those who are able to survive in the soil but for a short time. Many of \n\nthese pathogens can also live in the soil as non-pathogenic under certain \n\nconditions (Chapter 6 \u2013 6.1- Major soil pathogens). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n8 \n\n \n\n1 . 4  ( A )  B i o t i c  s t r e s s  a n d  d i s t u r b a n c e  i n  c r o p s   \n \n\nCrop stress can be related to living factors (biotic) as diseases, predators, \n\ncompetition, insects\u2019 outbreaks, fungi, bacteria, and nematodes. Or they can \n\nbe related to nonliving factors (abiotic) that including changes in pH, 02 \n\navailability, rainfall, light intensity, soil properties, among others. Disturbances \n\noften break the normal function of the system causing dynamic growth patterns \n\nand different patches on habitat level (Hooper et al. 2000; Van der Putten et al. \n\n2001). In natural systems the plant community reorganization after stress or \n\ndisturbance can take a long time to stabilize and is dependent of spatial \n\nheterogeneity or dispersal rates. Usually we refer to \u201cdisturbance\u201d as a short term \n\nevent (Tobor?Kap?on et al. 2006) and the equilibrium state can be reached \n\nsimilar to the one before. When a factor of disturbance persists is called \u201cstress\u201d. \n\nIf the plant populations are capable to handle this kind of stress, the equilibrium \n\nreached might be different from the original one, because of the presence of \n\nthe stress factor, that continuously affect the energy budget of the organisms. In \n\nagriculture, the soil biodiversity is reduced, most likely due to frequent \n\ndisturbance, and stability may depend on management regime. Organically \n\nmanaged soil usually is more stable than the intensively managed soil (Grayston \n\net al. 2001; Griffiths et al. 2001) and also depends on the type of stress, \n\ndisturbance or the combination of these factors. Therefore, and even though \n\nresistance against outbreaks or stress of pests, diseases and resilience from \n\ndisturbance is of particular importance in agriculture, still a lot of these processes \n\nare unknown (Brussaard et al. 2007). A soil is considered suppressive when, in \n\nspite of other favorable condition for the disease, it does not establish or persist \n\nwith little to no damage to crop yield (Baker and Cook 1974; Janvier et al. 2007). \n\nIn contrast, conductive (non-suppressive) soils are prone to disease. Soil \n\nsupressiveness is related to fertility level and nature of the soil itself, as well as its \n\nmicrobiological community activity. The better the abiotic conditions and more \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n9 \n\n \n\nbiodiversity a soil is the more suppressive it can be (Cook and Baker 1983; \n\nGarbeva et al. 2004). Supressiveness has been further defined into general \n\nsupressiveness and specific supressiveness. General suppression is the result of \n\nhigh total microbial biomass and biodiversity which creates unfavorable \n\nconditions to the development of plant diseases. Specific suppression, on the \n\nother hand, is due to the effects of individual or selected groups of \n\nmicroorganisms during particular stages of the pathogen life cycle (Cook and \n\nBaker 1983). \n\nIn agriculture, different type of management can have different effects \n\non disease rate, as mentioned before. These effects can be positive or negative \n\ndepending on the mechanisms (Litterick et al. 2004; Bonanomi et al. 2007; \n\nBonanomi et al. 2010) which can involve toxic substances, promoting mutualism, \n\nplant chemistry defences , among others (Van der Putten et al. 2001). The \n\nimportance of soil biodiversity in crop systems is still little understood, but a study \n\nin semi-natural systems has shown that biodiversity promote healthier crops (Van \n\nder Putten and Van der Stoel 1998). But threats to soil biodiversity can alter soil \n\ncommunity structure and internal food web interactions, resulting in damaging \n\nimpacts on the ecosystem\u2019s self-regulation properties and favours pests and \n\ndiseases. Biological pest control promotes primary production, what will bring \n\nmore efficiency to the system and healthier crops (Altieri 2002; Turb\u00e9 et al. 2010). \n\nParticular types of weeds, for example, can harbour and support \n\nbeneficial arthropods species capable to fight pest populations (Boatman 1994). \n\nIn general, the more diverse and stable the agro-system, the more stable the \n\ninsect community. A diverse agro-ecosystem has a balance that hinders the \n\ndevelopment of pests and invasive species, as the species present cover all the \n\navailable ecological niches and the resources available in an optimal way. Thus, \n\nkeeping a high bio-diverse ecosystem is an important part for a good defensive \n\nstrategy of agricultural management at least for generalist pest species. \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n10 \n\n \n\nIntegrated management of soil biota, biodiversity and agricultural \n\necosystems is a holistic process that relies largely on locally available resources, \n\nclimate, and socioeconomic conditions. Above all, the direct involvement of \n\nfarmers and stakeholders is a key to identify and adapt management practices \n\nto their specific context. So, the conservation of the biodiversity, the \n\ndevelopment of farming systems with greater reliance on ecosystem services \n\nshould increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems (McLaughlin and Mineau \n\n1995; Pretty 1995; Altieri 1999; Robertson and Swinton 2005; Young et al. 2005; \n\nKlein et al. 2007). \n\n \n\n 1 . 5  S u s t a i n a b l e  a g r i c u l t u r e  s y s t e m s  \n \n\nDuring the last decades the intensification and specialization of crop \n\nproduction has been a major trend in agricultural systems. To this is associated \n\nan increased use of fossil fuel energy due to the intensive use of agrochemicals \n\n(fertilizers and pesticides), mechanization and irrigation. As a consequence of \n\nintensification and specialization, there has been an increase in soil erosion rates, \n\na decrease in soil organic matter content and associated losses of soil structure \n\nand water holding capacity (Matson et al. 1997; Cassman 1999). The pest and \n\ncrop disease problems have increased, while soil biodiversity reduces and an \n\nincrease in vulnerability to climate change and related extreme disturbances is \n\nexpected (Dogliotti 2003; Altieri and Toledo 2011; Reich et al. 2012). According \n\nto Millennium Ecosystem Assessment many farming systems have a high \n\ndependence on fossil energy and suffer from the deterioration of their \n\necosystem services (Provisioning services, Regulating services, Cultural services, \n\nSupporting services). So it is urgent to improve systems by optimizing the use of \n\nwater and energy including the internal ecological cycles to achieve long term \n\nsustainability goals (Altieri et al. 2012). \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n11 \n\n \n\nSustainable agricultural systems depend on the maintenance of the soil health \n\n(a soil to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality and \n\npromote plant and animal health) (Doran and Zeiss 2000). A healthy soil has the \n\ncapacity to provide resistance to external stresses, for example, the suppression \n\nof disease spread can be seen as a manifestation of soil health, (Van Bruggen \n\nand Semenov 2000; Berkelmans et al. 2003; Schmidt and Skidmore 2003). \n\nHowever, it should be taken into account that for different types of soils different \n\nkinds of agricultural management systems are probably needed in order to \n\nimprove or maintain soil health (Abawi and Widmer 2000)(fig. 3). A general \n\nmeasure of soil quality and health is organic matter content. The soil organic \n\nmatter is generally known to reduce the incidence and severity of soil borne \n\ndisease in crop systems by inducing its suppression (Baker and Cook 1974). \n\nNumerous cultural practices like cropping sequences, green manures, cover \n\ncrops, mulches, composts and animal manures affect soil organic matter and \n\nconsequently pathogens. The incorporation of compost (Lewis et al. 1992; \n\nHoitink and Boehm 1999; Darby et al. 2006), crop residues and biological soil \n\ndisinfestation (Blok et al. 2000; Gamliel et al. 2000) is commonly reported to \n\nFigure 3 The relationship between planned biodiversity (that which the \n\nfarmer determines, based on management of the agroecosystem) \n\nassociated and how  this promote ecosystem function (Altieri 1999) \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n12 \n\n \n\nreduce soil-borne diseases. Yet monitoring large scale intensified crop systems is \n\nchallenging. For this reason, remote sensing is a great tool to understand this \n\ndynamic above-below ground interaction. It has been showed that when plants \n\nare exposed to different stress or disturbance factors have intra-specific plant \n\nchemical variation. These differences can be analysed by the plant canopy \n\nwhen plant is expose, and also can be linked with soil fertility (Wessman et al. \n\n1988; Ferwerda et al. 2005; Knox et al. 2010; Skidmore et al. 2010; Asner and \n\nMartin 2011; Carvalho 2013). Certain chemicals compounds can be associated \n\nwith certain stresses and by hyperspectral reflectance this can be measured \n\n(Curran 1989). It means that soil organism can influence plant responses \n\naboveground through chemicals changes (Kostenko et al. 2012; Carvalho 2013) \n\nand this changes can been seen through spectral reflectance patterns. \n\nFurthermore, it is known that abiotic changes can also be recognized by \n\nspectral measurements (Wessman et al. 1988; Asner and Martin 2011). \n\n \n\n1 . 6  S p e c t r o s c o p y  a n d  i t s  p o t e n t i a l  f o r  m o n i t o r i n g  \n\na g r i c u l t u r e  m a n a g e m e n t  \n \n\nThe spectral properties can be defined as a response of the material to a \n\nsinusoidal component (waves) which can vary in frequency (Gates et al. 1965). \n\nSpectroscopy is the part of physics concerned with the production, transmission, \n\nmeasurement and interpretation of electromagnetic spectra. All types of \n\nmaterials have a specific radiation that can be reflected, transmitted or \n\nabsorbed. This interaction is dependent on the materials\u2019 constitution and its \n\nphysical properties (Suits 1983). Reflectance is a common measurement in \n\nspectral sensors. Reflectance is defined as the ratio of the amount of \n\nelectromagnetic radiation reflected from a surface to the amount originally \n\nstriking the surface. Any illuminated surface reflects and the most important \n\ncharacteristic is its independence from the amount of the radiation reaching \n\nthe surface of the material(Monteith and Unsworth 2013).

It has the potential to detect the presence or absence of certain \n\ncompounds, such as nitrogen, chlorophyll ,among others (Ollinger et al. 2008). \n\nMany spectral vegetation indices (SVI\u00b4s), have the potential of monitoring \n\nbiomass, phenology and physiological conditions of the plants (Pe\u00f1uelas and \n\nFilella 1998). \n\nThe potential yield of agricultural and horticultural crops worldwide is \n\naffected by a variety of biotic and abiotic stress factors. These factors can play \n\na role in plant chemical dynamics through time. Spectroscopy can measure \n\nthese chemical or physical properties in a non-destructive method (West et al. \n\n2010). The plant interaction with biotic and abiotic factors has also been \n\nreported in spectral measurements (Jackson 1986; Graetz 1990), since the \n\nbiophysical to the biochemical plants change (Mahlein et al. 2012). The \n\nspectroscopy and other new technology are a great tool to develop new \n\ntechniques in sustainable agriculture management. The new technology can \n\nprevent losses between 18 to 32% caused by pests, excluding also the losses \n\nbecause of the fungi, bacteria and viruses (Oerke and Dehne 2004).  \n\nThe occurrence of diseases in plant growth (even more in early stages) in \n\nthe field is heterogeneous in time and space (Waggoner and Aylor 2000). \n\nHowever, traditional agricultural management considers the crop field as a \n\nhomogeneous site, so most of the times the input of nutrients or pesticides don\u2019t \n\nfit the dynamic demand (Steiner et al. 2008). This will have an impact on soil \n\nhealth and in the economic value of crops. Therefore remote sensing \n\ntechniques could be a reliable technique for accurate estimate of diseases, \n\npredict yield loss, monitor and forecast epidemics and understand biological \n\nprocesses. \n\nThe use of such innovative technologies in agriculture has been \n\nsummarized as \u201cprecision agriculture\u201d where the main focus is to optimize the \n\nagricultural production of crops, reducing damage and waste into the \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n14 \n\n \n\nenvironment. This concept takes spatial and temporal variability within the field \n\ninto account, instead of the traditional management based on a hypothetical \n\naverage (Pierce and Nowak 1999). The site specific management is expected \n\nto change the yield and the quality of the production, lead to a better use of \n\nthe resources, while preserving the quality and the quantity of the agricultural \n\nsoils and products (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010). A recent example is \n\nreported by (Mahlein et al. 2013) as they develop specific spectral indices (SDIs) \n\nfor the detection of diseases in crops in order to improve disease detection, \n\nidentification and monitoring in agricultural systems. The potential of the remote \n\nsensing techniques for agricultural purpose has been showed several times, \n\nespecially in fungal diseases (Thenkabail et al. 2000; Steddom et al. 2005; \n\nHillnh\u00fctter and Mahlein 2008; Galv\u00e3o et al. 2009; Oppelt, 2004 ; Hillnh\u00fctter et al. \n\n2011). The precise disease control is a demanding challenge within precision \n\nagriculture but can offer a good prospective to decrease the costs of fungicide \n\nuse and its environmental impact (Steddom et al. 2005; Hillnh\u00fctter and Mahlein \n\n2008; Bock et al. 2010; Nutter Jr et al. 2010). In this I will study the difference \n\nbetween the biotic and abiotic factors influencing disease attack on crops \n\nusing spectral data.  \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L | \n\n15 \n\n \n\n1 . 7  R e s e a r c h  O b j e c t i v e s  \n \n\n1.7.1 General objective \n\n \n\nAbiotic stress factors such as heat, cold, drought, salinity, and nutrient \n\nstress have a big impact on world agriculture, and it has been suggested that \n\nthey reduce average yields by more than 50% for most major crop plants \n\n(Hammond-Kosack and Jones 2000). Furthermore, plants must defend \n\nthemselves from attack by a vast range of pests and pathogens, including fungi, \n\nbacteria, viruses, nematodes, and herbivorous insects (Herms and Mattson 1992). \n\nSince each stress can elicit plant cellular and molecular changes (de Boer 1993), \n\nleaf optical properties are influenced by the concentration of the biochemicals, \n\nwater content and leaf structure (Gueymard 2004). \n\nIn this thesis we will try to study above-below ground interactions through \n\nplant spectral reflectance and this potential to be applied in different \n\nagricultural regimes, aiming to improve crop monitorization and management in \n\nfuture approaches for precision agriculture. \n\n \n\n1.7.2 Specific objectives \n\n \n\n?

The tuber is \n\nthe storage organ of the sugar beet plant, and the tuber is as large as 90% of \n\nthe plant\u2019s biomass, while the crown represents the rest of its biomass (Elliot and \n\nWeston 1993; Gonzalez Garcia et al. 2006). \n\nThe tuber contains high concentration of sucrose and is mainly used for \n\nthe sugar extraction, as well as for bio-ethanol and bio-gas production (?ezbov\u00e1 \n\net al. 2013).  \n\nSince the Napoleonic wars the sugar beet crop has had an upsurge in \n\nproduction in Europe and in the USA. Breeding increased the total content of \n\nsugar from 1.6 to 20 %, increasing the value of the sugar beet crop (FAO 2009a). \n\nHowever, the production and the price of sugar beet have recently decreased \n\nin the EU due to political decisions related to agricultural subsidies and due to \n\nstrong competition with sugar from sugar cane. Today the EU, the USA and the \n\nRussian Federation are the biggest sugar beet producers with an overall \n\nharvested area of 1.5 million ha (FAO 2011), being an important crop in the \n\nNetherlands. Thus, 73000 ha were grown in 2013 in the Netherlands (Statistiek \n\n2014). \n\nCorn (Zea mays L.) derives its name from the Arawak mahizi which literally \n\nmeans \u2018that which sustains life\u2019 (MacCann 2001). Zea mays is an annual grass of \n\nthe Poaceae family.  \n\nOne main difference between corn and other cereals is that it tolerates \n\nseed heads, ears that are larger than any other grass. Corn has a higher yield of \n\nfood per unit than any other grain, being this productivity is one of the main \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\ncontributing factors of corn\u2019s appeal to farmers. Corn is generally cultivated \n\nthroughout the world, occupying 159 million ha, with a yield of over 5 ton/ha \n\n(FAO 2009b),but the US produces 40% of the total world\u2019s harvest that in 2009 \n\nwas 817 million tones. \n\nSugar beet and maize are frequently grown in the same crop rotation. The \n\nproportion of cultivated maize in several European sugar beet growing areas is \n\nexpected to rise due to a projected increase in demand for renewable \n\nresources over the next few years (Kluth and Varrelmann 2010).  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Soil pathogens \n\n \n\nAs soil pathogen attack treatment we will use two of the most common \n\nsoil pathogens that affect crops: the fungus Rhizoctonia solani (K\u00fchn, 1858) and \n\nthe nematode Pratylenchus penetrans (Cobb, 1917).  \n\nRhizoctonia solani is a very common, soil-borne fungal pathogen of crops \n\ngrown throughout the world and it has a great diversity of host plants. It\u2019s a \n\ncomplex fungus composed of genetically isolated populations called \n\nanastomosis groups (Ogoshi 1987). In this experiment we will use AG 2-2IIIB  \n\nwhich causes root and crown root in sugar beet and root rot in Corn (Sumner \n\nand Bell 1982) .  \n\nIt is estimated that Pratylenchus causes 77 billion dollars of damage \n\nworldwide each year as they are migratory endoparasites responsible for root \n\nlesion. The usual sign of disease is plant root necrosis (Abawi and Widmer 2000), \n\nbut they can also introduce more pathogens as secondary infections (Perry and \n\nMoens 2006). Both diseases are difficult to monitor by farmer due to their main \n\neffects being belowground. \n\n  \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n2 . 3  F i e l d  S a m p l i n g  \n \n\nVredepeel is located in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands (51\u00b032\u2019N, \n\n5\u00b052\u2019E)(van der Linden and van der Pas 1998). It is part of the Applied Plant \n\nResearch facilities as a field station for long-term experimental farming. Long-\n\nterm agricultural experiments are essential to provide empirical data necessary \n\nto evaluate sustainability of agricultural systems (Geng et al. 1990; Barnett et al. \n\n1995). This field station is used to conduct research into arable farming, \n\nmultifunctional agriculture and field production of vegetables.  \n\nThe soil has been classified as a mesic Typic Haplaquod (De Bakker 1979) \n\nand it consists of 30 cm dark colored sandy topsoil overlying non-calcareous \n\nAeolian sand. The organic matter content of the top of the soil is approximately \n\n4.8%, and the underlying sand around 0.2%. The clay content of the soil is less \n\nthan 3% (Ritsema et al. 1998). \n\nThis location had been chosen because it is a long term experiment with \n\ndifferent kinds of soil management (Biologic treatment, artificial fertilizer \n\ntreatment, and manure treatment) (Tab. 1). The soil has been part of a 25-year \n\norganic amendment trial. The annual amendment treatments were either 25 \n\nton/ha manure, 50 ton/ha composted municipal organic waste, or a control \n\nwhich received mineral fertilizer (300 kg ha-1 KAS) and no organic matter (OM), \n\nto see more about the field site see (Korthals et al. 2014). The Biologic, Artificial \n\nFertilize and Manure type of soil had respectively 4.56%, 4.05% and 3.98% of OM \n\nin the beginning of the experiment (Tab. 1)(Bin 2014). \n\nSoil was collected on 25th September 2013. In each soil treatment we \n\nmade two parallel transects with one meter of distance from each other. From \n\neach treatment approximately 190 kg of soil were collected in 12 kg sterile \n\nplastic bags. \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nEach sampled bag was collected at a distance of 20 steps between \n\neach sample to approximately 15 cm depth. All soils were sieved with a 5mm \n\nmesh size to homogenize any spatial variation without obliteration of the soils \n\n\u2018biotic characteristics\u2019 (FAO 2011; Carvalho et al. 2012). Afterwards each soil \n\nwas divided into bags of 2.75 kg to standardize the amount of soil to put in each \n\npot and stored at 4oC. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Overview of the Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC, is an important part of the naturally occurring \n\norganic matter of soils, and a key driver of several ecosystem services of soils) composition of the soil at the \n\nstart of the experiment, shown in mg C per liter soil solution for each DOC fraction.

A row of 25 sterilized \n\nseeds were sown 1, 5 cm apart and 0.5 cm deep (for sugar beet) or 1 cm deep \n\n(for corn). Over 9 weeks all plants were growing in a greenhouse under 24-22\u00b0C \n\nwith a 16h photoperiod and 80% relative humidity (Mendes et al. 2011). The \n\nplants were watered weekly with demineralized water and 2 times during the \n\nexperiment with standard Hoagland solution (macronutrients only)(Mendes et al. \n\n2011). All pots were maintained at a soil water hold capacity (WHC) of 60%. To \n\nminimize spatial variance, the pots were ordered using a completely \n\nrandomized design, which was re-randomized after four weeks. In order to \n\nmend observed nutrient deficiencies in the crop plants, 20 mmol NH4NO3 and 13 \n\nmmol KH2PO4 were added per pot in two application steps (on 28 October and \n\n3 November), using 50 ml of a 200 mM NH4NO3 and 130 mM KH2PO4 solution per \n\napplication step. On 25 November 2012, 54 days after the planting of the sugar \n\nbeet seeds and corn seeds, the experiment was terminated by harvesting the \n\nplant, and the biomass was calculated after drying all the plants at 70\u00b0C for two \n\ndays. \n\nThe experiment setup consisted of two plant species \u00d7 seven soil treatments \n\n(X \u2013 Control, R \u2013 Rhizoctonia, P \u2013 Pratylenchus, N \u2013 Nutrients, G \u2013 Gamma-\n\nradiation, E \u2013 Empty, NR \u2013 Rhizothonia+Nutrients). \n\n?

The \n\nculture was introduced in an agar plug of 5 mm of a one week-old potato \n\ndextrose agar (PDA).

We introduced 18000 individuals of P. penetrans in a \n\n500 ml solution and we introduced them using a 5 ml pipet into the whole (5 ml \n\na 180 ind/ml).

This method is used in many laboratories \n\nand is suitable for samples from 100 - 1000 ml. The separation of nematodes and \n\nsoil particles is achieved in 3 steps and is based on the weight, the shape and \n\nthe activity of the nematode. \n\nWe separate 4 samples from each type of soil with 100 ml each in total 12 \n\nglass jars. We start to fill the elutriator with clean water to the outlet of the funnel \n\npipe. When is full we open the constant upward water stream which enters the \n\nbase of the elutriator through a perforated pipe (flow set 1000 ml/min). We \n\nplaced the moist soil sample in the top sieve and washed it into the elutriator via \n\nthe funnel with the baffle plate until 2/3 of the column is filled up. We turned off \n\nthe top nozzle and reduce the upward stream of water to 6000 ml/min, in order \n\nto fill at a constant water stream.

This \n\nmethod is commonly used maintaining the condition of the nematodes \n\nextracted from the roots  good to identify at high magnification (FAO 2009a). \n\nAfter we carefully washed the root material with water we cut off a small \n\npart of the root of Sugar beet and Corn from the nematode infected and the \n\ncontrol treatments. In a fume hood we inserted the small roots with forceps in a \n\nlacto phenol solution and stored in a cold chamber at 4 \u00baC for two months. The \n\nnematodes will stain blue while the plant tissue will not be colored. After two \n\nmonths we wash off the excess stain with water and the root material was \n\ntransferred to pure lactophenol, afterwards in order to observe them under the \n\nmicroscope the rots were transferred to a petri dish filed with glycerin/water 1:1 \n\nfor more information about the protocol see (Van Bezooijen 2006). \n\n \n\n2 . 7  S p e c t r a l  m e a s u r e m e n t s  \n \n\nSpectral reflectance data were collected with an ASD Fieldspec 3 \n\nspectrometer with an ASD plant-probe and leaf-clip device attached (ASD Inc., \n\nBoulder CO, USA).

To monitor the \n\ndifferences overtime in the Corn leaves through spectral reflectance we collect \n\ndata 5 times during the experiment (10/10/2013 - 17/10/2013 \u2013 25/10/2013 - \n\n30/10/2013 - 08/11/2013). For each point of time we got 625 measurements. \n\nFor Sugar beet the measurements were different as the seedlings were too \n\nsmall to measure the leaves in the first weeks.

On other hand, the treatment*species (Tab. 2, \n\nP&lt;0. 001) interaction resulted in significant effects on the total average plant \n\nbiomass (Tab. 2).

In the Sugar \n\nbeet the Gamma treatment the Manure type of soil had higher total biomass \n\nthan the Biologic type of soil (Fig. 5). In the same species there was increment on \n\ntotal biomass in the Biologic type of soil when was added nutrients in the R. \n\nsolani treatment. \n\nIn both plant species shoot biomass was significantly affected by the \n\ndifferent types of soil (Tab. 3, P= 0. 015) and different treatments (Tab. 3, P&lt;0. \n\n001). No interaction was found between the plant species, type of soil and \n\ntreatment was not significant (Tab. 3, P> 0. 05). Manure type of soil had \n\nsignificant differences from the Artificial fertilizer (Fig. 6, P&lt;0. 001) but not from \n\nthe Biologic (Fig. 6, P> 0. 05) in both plant species. There were no significant \n\nchanges in shoot biomass between the treatments with P. penetrans, Gamma \n\nradiation, R. solani and Control (Fig. 6, P&lt;0. 001). Significant differences were \n\nfound between the P.penetrans treatment and Gamma radiation, Nutrients, \n\nand Nutrients + R. solani (Fig. 6, P&lt;0. 05). In Corn, this difference resulted in less \n\nbiomass in the Gamma treatment when compared to the Nutrients, Nutrients + R. \n\nsolani and P. penetrans treatment. Furthermore, in the same species, the \n\nP.penetrans treatment had less biomass than Nutrients and Nutrients + R. solani \n\nin the Biologic soil type.

In Sugar beet the significant differences are in the higher shoot \n\nbiomass of the Nutrients + R. solani and Nutrients treatment both in the Biologic \n\nsoil type (Fig. 6). As in Corn species, the Artificial Fertilizer type of soil had always \n\nthe lowest shoot biomass (Fig. 6). The treatment Gamma, R. solani, and Control \n\nhad no significant differences in this species. The shoot biomass was always \n\nhigher than the roots biomass, independent of treatment or species (data not \n\nshown). In general the total biomass was higher in the first segment of the pot \n\n(Fig. 5).

All other indices were correlated with \n\nthe three selected (Tab.

Species were significantly different (P&lt;0. 001). \n\nIndeed, the tested factors influenced all of the analyzed indices, with the \n\nexception of DSWI (Tab. 4).

The interaction of the soil factor with treatment and species influenced \n\nthree of the analyzed indices. In the first case (soil*treatment), a significant \n\nhigher effect was detected in NDVId (Tab. 4, P= 0. 003), while in the second \n\ncase (soil*species) the affected indices were NDVId (Tab. 4, P= 0. 03), Psa (Tab. 4, \n\nP= 0. 05) and mREP (Tab. 4, P= 0. 04), with less effect in the Psa index.  \n\nThe Manure type of soil was significantly different from the Biologic and \n\nArtificial fertilizer (Fig. 7- a). In the Corn species the NDVI decreased in the \n\nBiologic comparing to the others soil types (Fig. 7- a), with less effect in the \n\nP.penetrans treatment. In the same species Gamma-radiation treatment there \n\nwas a significant increase in the NDVI in the Artificial fertilizer soil (Fig. 7- a). The \n\nNDVI increased in the Manure type of soil in the treatment P. penetrans, R. \n\nsolani , and Control and decreased in the Biologic type of soil (Fig. 7- a). In the \n\nSugar beet species, the soil type with higher positive NDVI effect was the \n\nManure in all the treatments and the Biologic soil was always lowest positive \n\neffect. Treatment wise Gamma had a significantly more NDVI effect while the \n\nless effect outcome was in the Biologic type of soil in the R. solani treatment.  \n\nIn the Plant Stress index (PSa) significant effect of species and treatment \n\n(Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 001) were found. The Manure and the Biologic types of soil were \n\nsignificantly different from each other in both plant species with a significant \n\nincrease of Psa in the Biologic type of soil (fig. 7- c, P&lt;0. 001). In the Corn species \n\nthe PSa was always higher in Biologic soil than in the other types of soil especially \n\nin the R. solani treatment (Fig. 7- c).  Treatment wise PSa was always higher in P. \n\npenetrans, R. solani and Control treatments than in the Gamma radiation \n\ntreatment (Fig. 7- c). In both species Nutrients + R. solani treatment had a \n\nsignificant increase in Psa index in the Biologic type of soil. In the Control \n\ntreatment and in the Pratylenchus treatment the positive trend in effect was \n\nfrom Biologic to Artificial fertilizer and to Manure types of soil. The lowest Psa \n\neffect in Corn species was in the Artificial fertilizer type of soil, especially in \n\ntreatment Gamma (Fig. 7- c).

There was a highly significant interaction between treatment and species \n\n(Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 001). In corn species Gamma treatment there was a significant \n\nincrease in mREP from Biologic to Manure to Artificial fertilizer (Fig.7- b). There \n\nwas a significant decrease in mREP in the P.penetrans treatment in Biologic soil \n\ntype comparing to the other types of soil. The Control treatment and the \n\ndiseases treatments (R. solani and P. penetrans) increase the mREP trend from \n\nManure, to Artificial Fertilizer to Biologic type of soil. In the Sugar beet there was \n\nan increase the mREP effect in the Control treatment of the Manure soil type \n\ncomparing to all the others treatments. And there was a decrease in mREP \n\neffect in the R. solani treatment of the Biologic soil comparing to the other \n\ntreatments (Fig. 7- b). In the Gamma treatment mREP had a significant increase \n\nfrom Artificial Fertilizer to Biologic to Manure (Fig. 7- b). The treatment Control, R. \n\nsolani and P. penetrans increase the mREP trend from Manure, to Artificial \n\nFertilizer to Biologic type of soil.

There was a two-way interaction between species*treatment, \n\nsoil*treatment and species*soil (Tab. 4, P? 0. 003). The effect of treatment or type \n\nof soil alone was not significant (Tab. 4, P> 0. 05).In Corn species the Gamma \n\nradiation treatment in the Artificial fertilizer soil the mean NDVI temporal \n\ndifference was approximately null, while there was a positive NDVI temporal \n\ndifference in the other two soil regimes. In the same species P.penetrans \n\ntreatment showed an increase in NDVI temporal difference, especially in the \n\nBiologic soil, when compared to other treatments and soils (Fig. 8- a).  In the \n\nCorn species Biologic soil had a significant increase in NDVI temporal difference \n\nwhen compared to the other soils type (Fig. 8- a). The only exception was the R. \n\nsolani treatment in the Artificial fertilizer soil which had a superior positive NDVI \n\ntemporal difference (Fig. 8- a). While in Corn species the Nutrients + R. solani  \n\ntreatment, had always a positive NDVI temporal difference, in Sugar beet the \n\nNDVI temporal difference was always negative (Fig. 8- a). The Biologic type of \n\nsoil showed the highest negative NDVI temporal difference in the R. solani \n\ntreatment, the lowest negative NDVI temporal difference was in Gamma \n\nradiation treatment in Sugar beet species. In sugar beet, the lowest negative \n\nNDVI temporal difference was found in Manure type of soil (Fig. 8 \u2013 a). This \n\ntemporal difference is especially notorious in Control and pathogen treatments. \n\nThe NDVI temporal difference in the Artificial Fertilizer soil was lower in the \n\nGamma treatment.  \n\nThe treatment (P&lt;0. 001) and the species (P&lt;0. 001) significantly \n\ninfluenced the temporal differences in the Psa index. Regarding the interaction \n\nof the factors, the tree-way interaction (soil*treatment*species) did not result in \n\na significant effect (P >0. 05), neither the interaction between treatment*soil \n\nb \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n(Tab. 4, P >0. 05). Thus, the two-way interaction species*soil (Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 05) and \n\ntreatment*species (Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 001) did result in an effect in the temporal \n\ndifferences. There was no significant effect of soil type into PSa temporal \n\ndifferences (Tab. 4, P> 0. 05). In the Corn species the temporal differences were \n\nalways in the negative range with the higher Psa negative temporal difference \n\nin the Gamma radiation treatment and lower Psa negative temporal difference \n\nin the R. solani  treatment both in the Biologic soil (Fig. 8- c).The Biologic soil had \n\nalways the higher Psa negative temporal differences. On the other hand, Sugar \n\nbeet plants had the Psa temporal differences in the positive range; the Biologic \n\ntype of soil had the higher Psa positive temporal difference in the R. solani , P. \n\npenetrans and Control treatment, the smaller Psa temporal difference in the R. \n\nsolani  treatment, in the Manure soil (Fig. 8- c). In sugar beet species Gamma \n\nradiation treatment had an increase in Psa positive temporal difference from \n\nManure, to Artificial fertilizer, to Biologic (Fig. 8- c). \n\nIn the mean temporal difference in the mREP index treatments (Tab. 4, P \n\n=0. 001), soil type (Tab. 4, P =0. 007) and species (Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 001) affected the \n\nindex. Concerning the interaction of the factors, the tree-way interaction \n\n(soil*treatment*species) did not result in a significant effect (P >0. 05), neither the \n\ninteraction between treatment*soil (Tab. 4, P >0. 05). The soil *species interaction \n\nwas found (Tab. 4, P&lt;0. 004) between initial and harvesting time. There was also \n\na significant effect in two-way interaction between treatment and species. In \n\nmREP there was an increase in mREP temporal differences in the corn grown in \n\nbiologic soil when compared to the others agricultural regimes where the \n\ndifferences were lower (Fig. 8). Treatment wise, Nutrients and R. solani treatment \n\nhad an increase in the mREP temporal difference when compared to the other \n\ntreatments in Corn species. The comparison between the treatment Nutrients \n\nand Nutrients + R. solani showed a significant positive mREP temporal difference \n\nbetween them, from Nutrients to Nutrient + R. solani (Fig. 8- b, P&lt;0. 001). In Corn \n\nspecies Gamma treatment had a decrease of mREP temporal difference from \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nBiologic to Manure, to Artificial fertilizer. In Sugar beet species all the mREP \n\ntemporal differences were in the negative domain (Fig. 8- b).

In the other hand Gamma \n\ntreatment had the lowest decrease of mREP temporal difference in the Biologic \n\ntype of soil (Fig. 8- b). There was no effect of nutrient fertilization in the R. solani \n\ninfected treatment (i.e. Nutrients + R. solani vs R. solani). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 Leaves temporal differences (T_initial \u2013 T_harvesting time) in: panel a\u2013 NDVI, panel b- mREP and \n\npanel c- PSa) per soil treatment.

In \n\nagroecosystem, biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services beyond \n\nthe production of food, including recycling of nutrients, regulation of \n\nmicroclimate and local hydrological processes, suppression of undesirable \n\norganisms and detoxification of noxious chemicals(Altieri 1999; Collins and \n\nQualset 2010). These above-belowground interactions are the main focus in this \n\nstudy, and how the plant spectral properties can change in relation with the \n\ndifferent agricultural regimes. \n\nLand use and management can change the soil as habitat, influencing \n\nthe soil food web and consequently soil biodiversity and productivity in different \n\nways. In general, intensification leads to the decrease of  soil organisms \n\nabundance and biomass, specially the soil organisms that drive  processes of \n\nthe C and N cycling (Vitousek and Walker 1989; Bardgett and Wardle 2003). \n\nNevertheless, groups as pathogenic fungi and nematodes can benefit with the \n\nintensification of the land use, as R. solani and P. penetrans. The total biomass of \n\nthese pathogens increase with a more intensive agriculture, in accordance with \n\nVan de Putten and coworkers (2001). The right choices of the agricultural \n\npractices and management, that promote net carbon accumulation, have \n\nbeen considered as an important mitigation option to the global warming \n\n(Freibauer et al. 2004; Gelfand and Robertson 2015; Kontopoulou et al. 2015).  \n\nThe impact of soil biota feedback on plant biomass interacts with soil nutrient \n\navailability, generally in a positive way (Van der Putten and Peters 1997; Wardle \n\n2002; Reynolds et al. 2003; De Deyn et al. 2004). Therefore, the shoot biomass in \n\nboth plant species studied increased with disposal of the nutrient supply \n\n(Fertilization treatment) in the biologic soil. In the fertilized and infected \n\ntreatment the biomass was also high with no soil pathogen effect in the plant \n\nbiomass independent of the species. This lack of pathogen effect is known to \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\noccur, as high nutrient concentration reduces soil biota effects in plant biomass \n\n(Van der Putten and Peters 1997; Carvalho et al. 2012). Troelstra et al. (2001) \n\nconcluded in several greenhouse experiments, with sterilized dune soils, that \n\nectoparasitic nematode species affect negatively plant growth. When \n\ncomparing the infected and control treatments, no losses in biomass due to \n\ninfection were found in the Manure regime. The application of manure compost \n\nthat is rich in nitrogen may have reduced soil-borne diseases effects by releasing \n\nallelochemicals generated during soil storage and subsequent microbial \n\ndecomposition (Lazarovits et al. 1999; Bailey and Lazarovits 2003). This \n\naccumulation of nitrogen and carbon also stimulate the increment of soil \n\nmicrobial diversity, also conferring protection against soil-borne diseases(DOC \n\n15.88, table1) (Conn and Lazarovits 1999; Kumar et al. 2012). It was also \n\nrecognized that manure composts have an acid pH (HA =8.5/FA=3.55, table1), \n\nhelping biotic control activity, such as antifungal activity due to the formation of \n\nnitrous acid (Tenuta and Lazarovits 2002; Timmusk 2003) but crop, soil type and \n\nmanagement also play a role (Hoitink and Boehm 1999; Brussaard et al. 2007). \n\nThe soil sterilization, using Gamma radiation amendment was used to show soil\u00b4s \n\npathogenic potential in several studies (Oremus and Otten 1981; Maas et al. \n\n1983; Van der Putten et al. 1988; Putten and Troelstra 1990; De Rooij-Van der \n\nGoes et al. 1995; Zoon 1995; Troelstra et al. 2001). In this study the lowest biomass \n\nwas found in the sterilized treatments suggesting that the soil biota has \n\ninfluenced the plant performance(Wardle et al. 2004) in this experiment.  \n\nThe Biologic type of soil had the highest shoot biomass which was, in some \n\ncases, 10 times larger the than in the Manure type of soil. The fact that biological \n\ntype of soil had the highest organic matter content (Bin 2014)suggests once \n\nagain that the organic materials also has impact on plant health and crop \n\nproductivity (Magdoff et al. 1997). In contrast with several studies where \n\nbiological type of soil can reduce disease incidence, (Abawi and Widmer 2000; \n\nGamliel et al. 2000; Bailey and Lazarovits 2003; Lazarovits et al. 2014) in this \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nexperiment we did not see this reduction. Birkhofer et al. (2008)and van \n\nDiepeningen et al. (2006) compared two different types of soil management: \n\nthe Organic and the Artificial fertilizer. Concluding that Organic systems are \n\nmore efficient in crop growth, soil quality and pest resilience. In contrast, the \n\nartificial fertilizers and herbicide/pesticide application affects the potential for \n\ntop-down control of aboveground pests negatively reducing the organic \n\ncarbon levels as well of both nitrate and soluble nitrogen in the soil. The worst \n\nplant performance was found in the Artificial fertilizer type of soil which supports \n\nearlier results. This demonstrates that this type of management is not the most \n\nsuitable to grow Corn or Sugar beet, because of the high level of pathogen \n\nattacks of these two species. One of the tested hypotheses was that the best \n\npractice in soil management would have a positive effect in the growth of the \n\nplants, in our case, the Biologic type of soil management. The biological \n\nmanagement had a significant interaction on species biomass even within the \n\nfungus attack treatment.  \n\nIn our hypothesis the best soil management would lead to lower peak in \n\nthe visible region from 400 to 700nm in the spectral signature, because of the \n\nlower plant stress. Plant stress results in lower chlorophyll concentration with an \n\nincrement of the reflectance in the visible region of the spectra (Adams et al. \n\n1999; Pinter et al. 2003).  Hillnh\u00fctter et al. (2011) showed that NDVI is a suitable \n\nindex for the assessment of the symptoms caused by R. solani  in Sugar beet \n\nplants under controlled conditions. In this experiment, the infection due R. solani \n\nwas detected with the decrease of NDVI in biologic type of soil. This did not hold \n\nfor the other types of soil management at the initial time. However, all the Sugar \n\nbeet plants in the other types of soil management were already in severe \n\nconditions and not measured due to lack of living tissue. In the Biologic soil with \n\nthe R. solani treatment the plants were less stressed than in the other types of \n\nsoils as lower mortality rate occurred (personal observation). Accordingly with \n\nGarbeva et al. (2004) the microbiota in a \u201crich\u201d soil tend to reduce the severity \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nof the attack of soilborne pathogens (general disease suppression). So disease \n\nsuppression can be influenced by cropping and management practices (Huber \n\nand Watson 1970).  \n\nThe pathogen treatment P.penetrans increase the NDVI difference \n\nbetween initial and final time, especially in Biologic type of soil in Corn species. It \n\nsuggests that at the initial point the plant was in less stress than in the harvest \n\ntime, supporting that the in plants biological managed resist longer to the \n\ninfection. In Sugar beet species the NDVI negative temporal difference \n\nindicates that the Artificial Fertilizer had more stress in the plant due the \n\npathogen. However, the lack of stress in the Sugar beet might be an artifact of \n\nthe Sugar beet mortality rate. Plants that died were not possible to measure in \n\nthe subsequent spectral measurements. As a result, plants that survive infection \n\nmay indicate a lack of stress while what we find is a higher mortality. As such \n\nfurther tests need to be done in order to overcome this side effect. This condition \n\nhas the effect of broadening the green reflectance peak, increasing visible \n\nreflectance (Adams et al. 1999). \n\nOllinger (2011) showed that plants grown without nutrient addiction \n\nrevealed a different reflectance pattern than plants with nutrients addiction, as \n\nour experiment. During the experiment was seen physical modification in this \n\ntreatment in plant vigor. The Fertilization treatment when applied with the \n\npathogen R. solani in Biologic type of soil resulted in lower temporal differences \n\nsuggesting the system responded positively to the addiction of nutrients. \n\nThe temporal differences of the Corn species in NDVI and mREP were \n\npositive, and in the Sugar beet were negative differences. In the other hand the \n\nPsa temporal differences in Corn were negative and in Sugar beet positive. This \n\nresult shows that the temporal differences with SVI\u00b4s can have disadvantages \n\nonly living plants can be analyzed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\nC o n c l u s i o n  a n d  R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s  \n \n\nIt was possible to detect the symptoms of pathogenic soil borne diseases \n\non plant spectral analysis through Spectral Vegetation Indices.

The biological soil higher temporal variance \n\nsuggested a better resilience to pathogen attack and was considered the best \n\ntype of soil for plant quality.

Fungi are considered the \n\nmost important pathogen group with a great diversity. A fungus is a Eukaryote \n\n(cells having true nuclei), spore-forming (reproduction), heterotrophs organisms \n\n(obtain their carbon and energy from other organisms) and most of the true \n\nfungi are filamentous and branched(Hogg 2013). They digest food externally \n\nand they absorb nutrients directly through its cells walls. Some fungi obtain their \n\nnutrients from a living host \u2013 biotrophs, others obtain from dead host \u2013 \n\nsaprotrophs, and some infect a living host, but they kill host cells in order to \n\nobtain their nutrients \u2013 necrotrophs (Deacon 2005).  \n\nOver 20,000 species of fungi are parasites and cause disease in crops and \n\nplants. All plants are attacked by one species or another of phytopathogenic \n\nfungi. Individual species of fungi can parasitize one or many different kinds of \n\nplants. Plant fungal pathogens can be divided into five main taxonomic classes \n\nbased on morphological and biological characteristics: 1- \n\nPlasmodiophoromycetes, endoparisitic slim mold \u2013 e.g.: Plasmodiophora \n\nbrassicae, causing club root of crucifers - Spongosphora subterranean, causing \n\npowdery scab of potato tubers; 2- Oomycetes, water molds. They cause several \n\nkinds of diseases including seedling blights, damping-off, root rots, foliar blights \n\nand downy mildews.  Some notable diseases are the late blight of potato, \n\ndowny mildew of grape vine, sudden oak death and root and stem rot of \n\nsoybean, with some important pathogens including Aphanomycetes, Bremia, \n\nPhytophthora and Pythium; 3- Ascomycetes, phytopathogenic fungal diseases \n\nsuch as peach leaf curl (Taphrina sp.), powdery mildew (Podosphaera, (apple), \n\nmicrosphaera (azalea) and vascular wilt diseases (Verticillium, Fusarium). \n\nNormally these diseases are recognize by signs and symptoms in leaf illnesses, \n\nfruit and vegetable rots, root, stem and soft rots, brown rot (Monilinia, cancers, \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nanthracnose); 4- Basidiomycetes, which are club and mushroom fungi, that \n\ncause smut fungi, corn smut, loose smut of barley, bunt of wheat, hollyhock , \n\ncedar-apple, white pine blister, needle rusts, cereal rusts. Some of the species of \n\nAscomycetes and Basidiomycetes grow another type of spore that is asexually \n\ngenerated, which put them in a different class called 5- Fungi Imperfecti. The \n\nmost known pathogens in this group are Fusarium, Rhizocthonia, and Verticillium. \n\nMost of the soil borne fungi persists in the soil for a long term period; usually they \n\nproduce resilient survival structures like a melanised mycelium, clamydospores, \n\noospores and sclerotia. The ones that just produce the thin mycelium usually just \n\nsurvive for short periods. \n\nNematodes are small, non-segmented roundworms. Soil borne plant-\n\nparasitic nematodes spend the greatest part of their lives in the soil. Usually in soil, \n\nplant parasitic nematodes have three ways of living, either freely, as an egg or \n\nas a durable cyst. They can be external feeders on plant roots, or residents inside \n\nroots. This group of plant parasitic pathogens disturb crops by decreasing plant \n\nvigour and growth. In the field we can see some differences in the infection, \n\nsome plants are severely infested and others don\u2019t. Therefore, in the global yield, \n\ncrops will mature irregularly and the quality of the production will decrease. Root \n\nknot nematodes in general cause the drop in vigour, consequently severe \n\ndistortions and swellings of roots can affect the marketability of the root crops. \n\nCyst nematodes can survive for long periods of time, the female body dries in \n\nthe form of cyst, protecting the eggs within. Needle nematodes can feed at the \n\ntips of the roots, affecting root tips to swell and causing roots to fork or branch \n\nout. On the other hand, stubby root nematodes reduce the length of the roots. \n\nIn this experiment we used two different plant pathogen, as a nematode the \n\nPratylenchus penetrans and as Fungi the Rhizoctonia solani. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n6 . 2  P l a n t  s p e c t r a l  p r o p e r t i e s  \n \n\nThe primary source of energy for numerous biological processes of plants \n\nis the solar radiation. This radiant energy is essential in order to photosynthesize, \n\ngrow and develop during its \n\nontogeny and keep the \n\nthermodynamic balance in \n\nrelation to the environment. So \n\nthe interaction between solar \n\nradiation and plant is divide in \n\nthree categories: 1) thermal \n\neffects, where more than 70% \n\nof the solar radiation is \n\naffected by the plants\u2019 \n\ntemperature and transpiration \n\nprocesses (Gates 1965; Boyer \n\n1967; Gates 1968)j; 2) \n\nphotosynthetic effects, as \n\nphotosynthetically active \n\nradiation is used to transform \n\nsimple inorganic compounds \n\nsuch as water, carbon dioxide, \n\nminerals, salts in complex \n\norganic compounds like \n\nsugars, fats, proteins and 3) \n\nphotomorphogenic effects, where the solar radiation plays an important role \n\nregulating and controlling the growth and development. Influencing many \n\nchanges in plant morphology, physiology and biochemistry(Schmidt and \n\nSkidmore 2003). The optical properties of the leaves depends, therefore, on a \n\nnumber characteristics such as chlorophyll, carotenoid content and water, \n\n(A) \n\n(B) \n\nFigure S9 (A) The solar radiation spectrum above and below \n\nthe atmosphere, and (B) Typical reflectance spectra of crop, \n\ntree and soil surfaces \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\ncellulose and lignin and leaf internal structure, among others (Ross 1981; Schmidt \n\nand Skidmore 2003).The radiation incident upon the leaf surface may be \n\nreflected, absorbed, transmitted and scattered by leaf tissues, cells and their \n\norganelles. As such, the quantity of  reflection, absorption and transmission \n\ndepends on the wavelength of radiation, angle of incidence, surface, optical \n\nproperties and biochemical content of the leaf(Schmidt and Skidmore 2003).  \n\nIn this study the focus will be in the features of leaf reflectance patterns \n\nwhich can be subdivided in four main spectral regions (Ollinger 2011): Visible, \n\nred-edge, near infra-red and mid-infrared. \n\n \n\n6.2.1 The visible region \n\n \n\nMost of the radiation emitted by the sun appear in the range of 200 to \n\n2500 nm (Belward 1991; Carvalho 2013). Roughly half of the energy in incident \n\nradiation that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface is in the visible wavelengths (Fig. 2). As \n\nsuch, plants adapted their foliar pigments to use the energy in the visible region \n\nfor photosynthesis (Kumar et al. 2002). This pigment influence in reflectance \n\npatterns is mostly due to chlorophyll as it is around 5 to 10 times greater than \n\nothers pigment, such as carotenoids or xanthophyll. Green vegetation pigments \n\nuse electron transitions (Kumar et al. 2002; Ollinger 2011), as mechanism to \n\nabsorb the radiation. The energy resulted from this electron transition will be \n\nused for photochemical reactions. \n\n \n\nThus, some pigments adapted in this direction to be more effective in the \n\nuse of radiation and the wavelength of absorbed light depends upon the \n\nspecific pigment. We know that the lowest reflectance in the visible portion of \n\nthe spectrum is between 400-700nm due to the normally called spectral \n\nabsorption maxima of Chlorophyll around 420, 490 and 660nm (Knipling 1970; \n\nBelward 1991; Verdebout et al. 1994; Kumar et al. 2002; Belward and Valenzuela \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n2010; Ollinger 2011; Carvalho 2013).

The red edge is a unique characteristic feature of the \n\nliving plant spectral patterns because it results from two special optical \n\nproperties of plant tissue: high internal leaf scattering causing large near infrared \n\nreflectance and chlorophyll absorption giving low red reflectance. It is often \n\nrelated to the stress responses of vegetation and it is the most studied feature in \n\nthe spectral curve (Collins 1978).  \n\n \n\n6.2.3 Near-infrared region \n\n \n\nThe near-infrared region (NIR) is in the electromagnetic region between \n\nthe 700 -1300nm. In contrast with the visible region, plants have a high \n\nreflectance and transmittance in this region. The energy levels in near infrared \n\nregion are not enough for photochemical reactions and some studies \n\ndemonstrate that white and green leaves have the same reflectance in this \n\nregion, confirming that the pigments do not affect infrared (Billings and Morris \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n1951; Knipling 1970; Maas and Dunlap 1989; Sims and Gamon 2002; Gitelson et \n\nal. 2003). The main factor controlling the spectral responses in the near infrared \n\nregion is the internal structure of the leaf(Gates et al. 1965; Sinclair et al. 1971) as \n\neach cell acts like an elementary corner reflector. The distribution of the air \n\nspaces, size, shape and arrangement of the cells affects the passage of the \n\nlight in the leaf and the spectra in this region changes with the development, \n\ngrowth and senescence of the leaf (Jacquemoud and Baret 1990). \n\n \n\n6.2.4 Mid-infrared region \n\n \n\nIn the Mid-infrared region (1300-2500nm) the reflectance is much lower \n\nthan in Near Infra-red region (NIR). This area is characterized by strong water \n\nabsorption features (Pe\u00f1uelas et al. 1993; Schmidt 2003). The increase of water \n\ncontent in leaves will reduce the reflectance pattern not just in water \n\nabsorptions bands but also in other regions. This phenomenon of water \n\nabsorption is caused by transitions in the vibrational and rotational states of the \n\nwater molecules within the leave (Belward 1991). This region is also known for \n\nabsorption features of specific foliar biochemical lignin, cellulose, starch, \n\nproteins and nitrogen but usually they are camouflaged by water absorption in \n\nthe fresh leaf spectra. \n\n \n\n6.2.5 Vegetation indices \n\n \n\nVegetation indices are mathematical transformations of the original \n\nspectral reflectance signature. They are designed to diminish the additive and \n\nmultiplicative errors linked with atmospheric effects, soil background effects, \n\nsolar illumination, and sensor viewing geometry (Liang and Fang 2004). The \n\ndifferent vegetation responses create different spectral signatures in diverse \n\nspectral regions, which have been used to develop several arithmetic formulae, \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_reflector\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\ncommonly known as spectral vegetation indices (SVI\u00b4s). With the disposal of \n\nhyperspectral data and reflectance for a great number of spectral bands, \n\nseveral new vegetation indices have been developed. \n\nOver recent years, many indices vegetation have been developed for \n\ncrop biophysical parameters estimation, to detect stress in plants, based on \n\nchlorophyll and water content (Pe\u00f1uelas et al. 1993), pigment estimation \n\n(Penuelas et al. 1995; Blackburn 1998; Gitelson et al. 2003), and leaf area(Rouse \n\net al. 1973). Zarco-Tejada et al. (2001) described chlorophyll content as a \n\npotential indicator of vegetation stress because of its direct role in the \n\nphotosynthetic processes of light harvesting and initiation of electron transport \n\nand its responsiveness to a range of stresses. Knipling (1970) also specified that \n\nstress-induced alterations of spectral reflectance in the visible spectra result from \n\nthe sensitivity of leaf chlorophyll concentrations to metabolic disturbance.  \n\nSpectral vegetation indices (SVIs) have been shown to be useful for an \n\nindirect detection of plant diseases (Thenkabail et al. 2000; Hatfield et al. 2008). \n\nEfficient use of spectral reflectance measurements for disease detection relies \n\non the identification of most significant spectral wavelength, highly correlated \n\nto a specific disease. Mahlein et al. (2013) are trying to develop specific spectral \n\ndisease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. This kind of indices \n\ncan improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision \n\nagriculture applications (Mahlein et al. 2010). \n\nTable 6 (extra information) gives a synoptic overview of spectral \n\nreflectance indices as developed and tested by different authors. \n\n \n\n6.2.6 Ratio indices (RI) \n\n \n\nRatio indices are defined as quotients between measurements of \n\nreflectance in distinct parts of the spectra. These ratios are known to be \n\neffective in enhancing information, when there is an inverse relationship \n\n\n\n|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |  \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nbetween two spectral responses to the same biophysical occurrence.
