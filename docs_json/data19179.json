In fact, this\n\narea is pivotal in combining the theory of nonlinear evolution PDEs with geometry,\n\ndynamical systems and other areas of applied mathematics. Despite the fact that\n\nthe theory of linear PDEs experienced much progress, it was soon observed that\n\nmost of equations modelling physical phenomena, without excessive simpli?cation\n\nare nonlinear and some of them with singularities/degeneracies. Unfortunately, just\n\nafter the 1960s the development of functional analysis made it possible to start\n\nbuilding theories for these type of PDEs with full mathematical rigour.\n\nTwo of the most important degenerate/singular nonlinear PDEs are the porous\n\nmedium equation, shortly PME,\n\nut ? ?um = 0, m > 1, (PME)\n\nand the parabolic p-Laplace equation, shortly PLE,\n\nut ?div(|?u|p?2?u) = 0, p > 1, (PLE)\n\nwhere ? = ?x, ? = ?x represent the Laplace operator and the gradient operator\n\nrespectively, acting only on the space variables. Both equations can be posed for\n\nall x ? Rd, d ? 1 and 0 &lt;t &lt;? (Cauchy problem), but are quite often posed\n\nin a bounded subdomain ? ? Rd, d ? 1 and 0 &lt;t &lt;T (Dirichlet problem). In\n\nthe Cauchy problem the determination of a unique solution asks only for initial\n\nconditions, however in the second case boundary conditions are also needed. In this\n\ntext we will work just with local solutions, leaving aside the boundary conditions.\n\nBoth equations have great importance since they are both, somehow a generalization\n\nof the heat equation (notice that for m = 1 and p = 2 the equations are reduced to\n\nthe heat equation ut = ?u).\n\n1\n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nOur main goal is to describe the method of intrinsic scaling, a method for obtain-\n\ning continuity results, in particular H\u00f6lder continuity for weak solutions of degenerate\n\nand singular parabolic equations. This method can be used for a great number of\n\nequations, but it is famous mostly because it can be applied to the PLE, the PME\n\nand equations with a similar structure. To avoid some technical di?culties we will\n\nuse the PME as a model for the method.\n\n1.1. The porous medium equation\n\nThe reader may wonder why we have choosen a simple-looking variation of the\n\nfamous heat equation,\n\nut ? ?u = 0, (HE)\n\nfor this text. First of all, the fact that the theory of the PME departs strongly\n\nfrom the heat equation was a great booster both for the pure mathematician and the\n\napplied scientist to start studying this equation. This equation appears in several\n\nuseful applications and its study reveals to be very helpful on the development of\n\ninteresting and sophisticate results in nonlinear analysis.\n\nIn this regard, there are a number of physical applications where the simple PME\n\nmodel appears in a natural way, mainly to describe processes involving ?uid ?ow,\n\nheat transfer or di?usion. The best known is probably the description of the ?ow of\n\nan ideal gas in a homogeneous porous medium, indeed the PME owes its name to\n\nthis application, modelled by Leibenzon [8] and Muskat [11] around 1930. Another\n\nimportant application, essential for the historic development of the ?eld, happens\n\nin the theory of heat propagation, more speci?cally Zel'dovich and Raizer in [17],\n\npropose a PME as a model to describe heat propagation by radiation occurring in\n\nplasmas (ionized gases) at very high temperatures. In fact, this subject motivated\n\nthe rigorous mathematical development of the theory. Other applications have been\n\nproposed in mathematical biology, boundary layer theory, and other ?elds. This\n\nequation is also a good model to study hard subjects as ?nite propagation, free\n\nboundaries, self-similar solutions, among others. The reader can explore these areas\n\nin [16].\n\n1.1.1. The PME as a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation\n\nThe PME, and also the PLE, constitute the most famous examples of nonlinear\n\ndegenerate and singular parabolic equation. However, before exploring this fact let\n\n2\n\n\n\n1.1 The porous medium equation\n\nus remember what this concepts are.\n\nLinear parabolic PDEs are the most common evolution equations. These PDEs\n\ncan be de?ned in divergence form, as\n\nut ?\nn?\n\ni,j=1\n\n(aij(x,t))uxi)xj +\nn?\ni\n\nbi(x,t)uxi + c(x,t)u = f,\n\nwith aij measurable and bounded coe?cients satisfying the ellipticity condition\n\n?|?|2 ?\nn?\n\ni,j=1\n\naij?i?j ? ?|?|2, (1.1)\n\nfor all ? ? Rn. However in this text we will just study di?usion equations, which\n\nmeans that we will suppose bi = 0, c = 0. To simplify the calculations, we will also\n\nconsider the homogeneous case, f = 0.\n\nThe next step was extending this de?nition to quasilinear equations of the form\n\nut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = 0, (1.2)\n\npermitting the function A to be nonlinear, only assumed to be measurable and\n\nsubject to the structure conditions???\n??\nA(x,t,u,?u) \u00b7?u ? ?(x,t,u,?u)|?u|2\n\n|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? |?(x,t,u,?u)||?u|,\n(1.3)\n\nwhere ? and ? are given functions. This type of equations are still referred to as\n\nparabolic if there exist two positive constants ?0 ? ?1 such that\n\n?0 ? ?(x,t,u,?u) and ?(x,t,u,?u) ? ?1. (1.4)\n\nLastly, a parabolic partial di?erential equation of the type (4.2) is termed de-\n\ngenerate if the modulus of ellipticity ?(x,t,u,?u) tends to zero at some point of its\n\ndomain of de?nition; whereas it is termed singular if ?(x,t,u,?u) tends to in?nity.\n\nEasily we can conclude that the porous medium equation (PME) is of the degen-\n\nerate type. In fact, it can be rewritten in the divergence form as\n\nut ?div(mum?1?u) = 0, m > 1,\n\nwhere A = mum?1?u and ?(x,t,u,?u) = mum?1 which, evidently, tends to zero\n\nwhen u tends to zero.\n\nNotice that if we choose m &lt;1, then ? = mum?1 tends to in?nity as u also goes\n\nto in?nity and the equation will be singular. There is also a vast literature about\n\nthis case, however we will not study it in this text.\n\n3\n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nIt is also important to highlight that the p-Laplace equation (PLE) has similar\n\nproperties. It is another example of this type of equation because it is degenerate\n\nfor p > 2 and singular for 1 &lt;p &lt;2.\n\nThe fact that the PME is degenerate parabolic has deep mathematical conse-\n\nquences, both qualitative and quantitative. Even if, in the second half of the last\n\ncentury, when the tools of functional analysis were ready for it, the theory of non-\n\nlinear parabolic equations became a main area of research in PDEs not every result\n\ncould be extended to degenerate parabolic equation.\n\nOn the other hand, and as a sort of compensation, the equation enjoys a num-\n\nber of nice properties due to its simple form, which makes the PME an interesting\n\nbenchmark in the development of nonlinear analytical tools, and continues to make\n\nits way into the pure and applied sciences, and consequently into the mainstream of\n\nMathematics.\n\n1.2. Regularity theory and the method of intrinsic scaling\n\nNowadays, the regularity theory for PDEs is an important area for mathemati-\n\ncians. As many others recent areas, regularity theory just rose in 1900, after the\n\nwell-known International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris where David Hilbert\n\npresented his list of 23 problems that would shape the mathematics of the 20th cen-\n\ntury. The way this theory started to develop, with the great mathematicians Ennio\n\nDe Giorgi, John Nash and J\u00fcrgen Moser, is one of the most famous in the history\n\nin Mathematics. This subject was the main focus of my work in the ?rst semester\n\nand the reader can learn more about it in my seminar [13]. Although the work was\n\nwritten in Portuguese, if the language is a restraint there is also the paper [14] and\n\nthe book [15].\n\nIn the previously mentioned work, there is a detailed explanation on how De\n\nGiorgi proved that weak solutions of an elliptic PDE of the form\nn?\n\ni,j=1\n\n(\naij(x)uxj\n\n)\nxi\n\n= 0,\n\nwith bounded and measurable coe?cients aij satisfying an ellipticity condition (1.1)\n\nare H\u00f6lder continuous. Since the linearity does not play a role in the proofs of De\n\nGiorgi, Ladyzhenskaya and Uralt'seva, during the mid 1960's, were able to prove in\n\n[7] the same results for weak solutions of quasi-linear equations of the form\n\ndiv a(x,u,?u) = 0,\n\n4\n\n\n\n1.2 Regularity theory and the method of intrinsic scaling\n\nwith structure assumptions of the type???\n??\na(x,u,?u) \u00b7?u ? C1|?u|p ?C2\n\n|a(x,u,?u)| ? C2(|?u|p?1 + 1),\n\nwith p > 1, and constants C1 > 0 and C2 ? 0.\n\nThe next step is to pass to parabolic equations\n\nn?\ni,j=1\n\n(\naij(x)ut ?uxj\n\n)\nxi\n\n= 0,\n\nwith bounded and measurable coe?cients aij satisfying an ellipticity condition (1.1)\n\nand\n\nut ?div a(x,u,?u) = 0,\n\nwith the same structure assumptions. Notice that this assumptions are a bit stronger\n\nthan (1.3), and unfortunately these ones does not include the PME as a particular\n\ncase, just the PLE. This was how the theory evolved historically and just afterwards\n\nthe results were generalized, reducing the assumptions.\n\nMoser [10] was able to prove that weak solutions of linear parabolic equations\n\nare locally H\u00f6lder continuous, however it was not possible to extend the results\n\nto quasi-linear equations as we might expect, just for special cases. In 1967, La-\n\ndyzenskaja, Solonnikov and Ural'ceva, in [12], were able to prove it for quasi-linear\n\nequations with assumptions that include the parabolic case. Some other examples\n\nappeared in the literature, however this problem remained open until mid 1980's\n\nwhen DiBenedetto, in [4], showed that the solutions of quasilinear equations with\n\nthe previous assumptions are locally H\u00f6lder continuous. It was necessary to employ\n\na new approach to this problem and the answer was found with the intrinsic scaling\n\nmethod. Surprisingly, this showed to be very versatile and could be appropriately\n\nmodi?ed to establish the same results for more general assumptions, including the\n\nporous medium equation.\n\nContinuity results of a function at a certain point can be obtained by measuring\n\nits oscillation in a sequence of nested and shrinking cylinders with vertex at that\n\npoint, and proving that the oscillation converges to zero as the cylinders shrink to\n\nthe point. For the heat equation this idea work for the simple standard parabolic\n\ncylinders,\n\nQ(R2,R) = {(x,t) ? Rd \u00d7R+; ||x?x0||? ? R2, 0 ? t0 ? t &lt;R},\n\n5\n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nhowever for more complicated equations as the PME thus is not enough. These\n\ncylinders must be rescaled to take into account the nature of the degeneracy or\n\nsingularity. A precise description of this fact is linked to the technical implementation\n\nthat we will develop in this works and will hopefully clarify the idea.\n\nAlthough it could seem that the proof would be similar to the heat equation a\n\nnew problem arises, the nature of the scaling factors. The only way the cylinders\n\ncould re?ect the geometry of the equation is with an intrinsic scaling, which means\n\nthat the scaling factors must depend on the solution itself.\n\nAt the basis of the intrinsic scaling method is an iteration technique, which\n\nconstitutes a re?nement of the technique by De Giorgi and Moser [13, 14], based on\n\na priori estimates for the weak solutions. These estimates will be integral inequalities\n\nthat measure the behaviour of the function near its in?mum and its supremum. In the\n\ncase of solutions of degenerate or singular equations, one more di?culty arises; the\n\nestimates are not homogeneous and involve integral norms corresponding to di?erent\n\npowers. However, since our cylinders are intrinsically rescaled, we can recover the\n\nhomogeneity when we rewrite the estimates in this cylinders, absorbing in this way\n\nmany analysis di?culties in the geometry.\n\nThe a priori estimates will be the main tools in establishing the local H\u00f6lder\n\ncontinuity for the solutions. Actually, once these estimates are obtained we don't\n\nneed the original equation any more as our problem turns to be purely analytic. We\n\nmay forget the initial equation and we just need to show that functions that satisfy\n\nour integral inequalities are locally H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\nThe main goal of this work is to help the reader understand this method in full\n\ndepth and to bring to light what is really essential in this powerful tool in the analysis\n\nof degenerate and singular equations. We want to highlight how the geometry and\n\nthe a priori estimates are important through all the proof. We want to convince the\n\nreader of the strength this approach to regularity for an important and relevant class\n\nof nonlinear partial di?erential equations.\n\n1.3. Outline of the text\n\nWe have chosen the porous medium equation as a model to present the theory\n\nfor degenerate nonlinear equations. This equation highlights what is really essential\n\nin the intrinsic scaling method, leaving aside technical di?culties that come along\n\nwith more general equations.\n\n6\n\n\n\n1.3 Outline of the text\n\nThis work is based on a similar work done for the p-Laplace equation in the\n\n?rst part of [15]. Some proofs are presented in more detail and some ideas are also\n\ninspired on others articles and books as [6] and [5, 16]. However, we do not pretend\n\nthis work to be just a rewrite of di?erent books and articles. Although the main idea\n\nof the method is identical, we found several technical di?culties. Some of them were\n\nsolved by consulting other papers, and others with original ideas.\n\nWe start in Chapter 2 by presenting the problem formally. In section 2.1 we\n\nintroduce the precise de?nition of weak solution for the model problem. This is\n\nfollowed, in section 2.2, by the derivation of the building blocks of the theory: the\n\nlocal energy and logarithmic estimates. Then, section 2.3 will highlight the technical\n\ntools that will be essential for the establishment of some results. The 3th chapter\n\npresents in full detail the idea of intrinsic scaling, at least for the degenerate equation.\n\nSection 3.1 deals with the construction of the appropriate geometric setting, bringing\n\nin full detail the idea of intrinsic scaling. At this point, the problem is divided in\n\ntwo alternatives, that will be studied separately in the sections 3.2 and 3.3. Finally,\n\nchapter 4 culminates with the proof of the H\u00f6lder continuity. In section 4.2 we refer\n\nto a simpler case that is not included in the previous approach to the parabolic case.\n\nWe close the chapter with remarks on possible generalizations, mainly to equations\n\nwith the full quasilinear structure and to the p-Laplace equation.\n\n7\n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\n8\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nWeak solutions and a priori\n\nestimates\n\nThe main goal of this work is to describe the intrinsic scaling method. In this\n\nchapter we will introduce some properties of the PME, de?nitions and results that\n\nwill be necessary trough the text. This method is used to prove the H\u00f6lder continuity\n\nfor the weak solutions of degenerate and singular parabolic equations. In this regard\n\nwe will use the porous medium equation,\n\nut ? ?um = 0, m > 1, (PME)\n\nto explain this method in detail, leaving aside technical di?culties related to more\n\ngeneral equations. We have chosen this equation because it is one of the simplest\n\nexamples of a parabolic non-linear evolution equation, appearing however in the\n\ndescription of several natural phenomena. Its properties depart strongly from the\n\nheat equation,\n\nut ? ?u = 0,\n\none of the most important PDE. There are a number of physical applications where\n\nthis simple model appears in a natural way, mainly to describe processes involving\n\n?uid ?ow, heat transfer or di?usion.\n\nMost physical settings lead to the default restriction u ? 0, which is mathemati-\n\ncally convenient. As reported in the literature, in order to consider solutions without\n\nthis property a variation of the PME is used,\n\nut ? ?(|u|m?1u) = 0, (2.1)\n\nusually referred as the signed porous medium equation. Some results can be extended\n\nto this equation, the H\u00f6lder continuity of the weak solutions inclusively. For the\n\npurpose of this work and to highlight the important aspect of the intrinsic scaling\n\nmethod we decided that the simple PME is enough, but we will leave remarks along\n\nthe text to guide the prove for the signed PME.\n\n9\n\n\n\nChapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates\n\nAdditionally, we will also suppose that u is bounded and set\n\nM := ||u||L?.\n\nAlthough only local boundedness is necessary we assume that u is bounded for\n\nsimpli?cation. So our goal is to prove that a non-negative and bounded solution, in\n\nsome sense, of the porous medium equation, (PME), is H\u00f6lder continuity.\n\nIf we consider ? to be a bounded domain in Rd, with smooth boundary ??,\n\nwe can de?ne the space time domain as ?T = ? \u00d7 (0,T], T > 0, with parabolic\n\nboundary ?p?T = (?? \u00d7 (0,T)) ? (? \u00d7{0}). Next we will consider the degenerate\n\nintrinsic parabolic distance from a compact set K ? ?T to ?p?T as\n\ndist(K; ?p?T ) := inf\n(x,y)?K\n\n(y,s)??p?T\n\n(\n|x?y| + |t?s|\n\n1\n2\n\n)\n.\n\nDe?nition 2.1 (Locally H\u00f6lder continuous). A function u is locally H\u00f6lder contin-\n\nuous in ?T if there exist a constant C and ? ? (0, 1), depending only on the data,\n\nsuch that, for every compact subset K of ?T ,\n\n|u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t2)| ? C\n\n(\n|x1 ?x2| + |t1 ? t2|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n,\n\nfor every pair of points (xi, ti) ? K, i = 1, 2.\n\n2.1. Two de?nitions of weak solutions\n\nNot many second-order partial di?erential equations have solutions in the strong\n\nsense. So we will start by de?ning weak solution for our problem. As usual, the\n\nde?nition of weak solutions is obtained by multiplying by a test function, integrate\n\nover a compact set and then integrating by parts. Formally it results in the following\n\nde?nition.\n\nDe?nition 2.2. A local weak solution of (PME) is a bounded measurable function\n\nu ? Cloc\n(\n0,T; L2loc (?)\n\n)\n?L2loc\n\n(\n0,T; W\n\n1,2\nloc (?)\n\n)\n,\n\nsuch that, for every compact K ? ? and for every 0 &lt;t1 ? t2 ?

H1loc\n(\n0,T; L2(K)\n\n)\n?L2loc\n\n(\n0,T; W\n\n1,2\n0 (K)\n\n)\n.\n\n10\n\n\n\n2.1 Two de?nitions of weak solutions\n\nHowever, this way of de?ning the weak solution does not involve the time deriva-\n\ntive ut, which would be very useful in some proofs. As ut sometimes can only exist\n\nin the sense of distributions we will introduce the Steklov average of a function\n\nv ? L1(?T ) for 0 &lt;h &lt;T :\n\nvh :=\n\n???\n??\n\n1\nh\n\n? t+h\nt\n\nv(.,?)d? if t ? (0,T ?h],\n\n0 if t ? (T ?h,T].\n\nThe Steklov average has nice properties: for v in the right spaces it converges to\n\nv as h goes to 0.\n\nLemma 2.3. If v ? Lr(0,T,Lq(?)) then, as h ? 0, the Steklov average vh converges\n\nto v ? Lq,r(?T??), for every ? ? (0,T). If v ? C(0,T; Lq(?)) then, as h ? 0, the\n\nSteklov average vh(\u00b7, t) converges to v(\u00b7, t) in Lq(?), for every t ? (0,T??) and every\n\n? ? (0,T).\n\nUsing the Steklov average it is possible to obtain another de?nition that will be\n\nmore useful through the calculations.\n\nDe?nition 2.4. A local weak solution of (PME) is a bounded measurable function\n\nu ? Cloc\n(\n0,T; L2loc (?)\n\n)\n?L2loc\n\n(\n0,T; W\n\n1,2\nloc (?)\n\n)\nsuch that, for every compact K ? ? and for every 0 &lt;t &lt;T ?h,?\n\nK\u00d7{t}\n(uh)t ? + m\n\n(\num?1?u\n\n)\nh\n\u00b7??dx = 0, (2.3)\n\nfor all ? ? W 1,20 (K).\n\nIn fact, let us prove that these de?nitions are equivalent.\n\nTheorem 2.5. The de?nitions 2.2 and 2.4 of weak solutions are equivalent.\n\nProof. (?) For all t ?]0,T ? h[, let us choose t1 = t and t2 = t + h, and the test\n\nfunction ? independent of the time and belonging to W\n1,2\n0 (K). In this way the\n\nequation (2.2) can be simpli?ed to read?\nK\nu\n??t+h\nt\n\n?dx +\n\n?\nK\n\n{\nm\n\n? t+h\nt\n\num?1?udt \u00b7??\n}\ndx = 0.\n\nTo ?nish this implication we just need to multiply both sides for 1\nh\nand notice\n\nthat (uh)t =\n1\nh\n\n(? t+h\nt\n\nu(\u00b7,?)d?\n)\nt\n\n= 1\nh\nu\n??t+h\nt\n\n.\n\n11\n\n\n\nChapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates\n\n(?) For this part let us start to ?x 0 &lt;t1 &lt;t2 ? T and ? ? H1loc\n(\n0,T; L2(K)\n\n)\n?\n\nL2loc\n\n(\n0,T; W\n\n1,2\n0 (K)\n\n)\n. Then we can choose for every t ? [t1, t2 ? h] the function\n\n?(\u00b7, t) ? W 1,20 (K) and integrate the equation (2.3) between t1 and t2 ?h , obtaining? t2?h\nt1\n\n?\nK\n\n(uh)t ? + m\n(\num?1?u\n\n)\nh\n\u00b7??dxdt = 0.\n\nNow we are in conditions to integrate by parts in time?\nK\nuh?dx\n\n????t2?h\nt1\n\n+\n\n?\nK\n\n? t2?h\nt1\n\n?uh?t + m\n(\num?1?u\n\n)\nh\n\u00b7??dxdt = 0,\n\nand then, we just need to let h ? 0. Using Lemma 2.3, the proof is over.\n\nRemark 2.6. For thesigned PME (2.1) the de?nition of weak solutions just has one\n\nsmall di?erence, it will appear um?1 instead of |u|m?1.\n\n2.2. A priori estimates\n\nRegarding the intrinsic scaling method, the ?rst step is to derive a priori estimates\n\nfor weak solutions. We need integral inequalities that measure the behaviour of the\n\nweak solutions near its in?mum and its supremum in the interior of an appropriate\n\ncylinder. At this point we can ignore the equation and it remains to show that\n\nfunctions that satisfy these inequalities are locally H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\nBefore presenting these inequalities, let us ?rst de?ne the cylinders mentioned\n\nbefore. Given a point x0 ? Rd, we denote the n-dimensional cube with centre at x0\n\nand wedge 2? by:\n\nK?(x0) :=\n{\nx ? Rd : ||x?x0||? &lt;?\n\n}\n.\n\nWe also de?ne the cylinder of radius ? and height ? > 0, with vertex at (x0, t0),\n\nas:\n\nC(x0, t0,?,?) = (x0, t0) + Q(?,?) = K?(x0) \u00d7 (t0 ? ?,t0),\n\nwith parabolic boundary\n\n?pC(x0, t0,?,?) = ?K?(x0) \u00d7 (t0 ? ?,t0) ? (K?(x0) \u00d7{t0 ? ?}).\n\nWe can, without loss of generality, restrict to cylinders with vertex at the origin\n\n(0, 0). Since the porous medium equation is invariant under displacement of the\n\ncoordinate axes, we can change to a generic point (x0, t0) with a simple translation.\n\nThis way, although we just prove the results for cylinders with vertex at the origin,\n\nwe claim that they are valid for cylinders with vertex at any point, which is necessary\n\n12\n\n\n\n2.2 A priori estimates\n\nfor the ?nal conclusions. We will also write K? to denote K?(0) and Q(?,?) instead\n\nof C(0, 0,?,?).\n\nWe recall that\n\nw+ = max(w, 0), w? = ?min(w, 0)\n\nand introduce the auxiliary function ul\u00b1 = \u00b1min{\u00b1u,\u00b1l}.\n\nFinally, it will also be essential to use a piecewise smooth cuto? function in\n\nQ(?,?) ? ?T such that\n\n0 ? ? ? 1, |??| &lt;?, ?(x,t) = 0, x /? K?.\n\n2.2.1. Local energy estimates\n\nThe ?rst inequality that needs to be proven is, somehow, a generalization of the\n\nfamous Caccioppoli inequality that is often used for elliptic equations. We use this\n\ninequality to control, in some sense, the norm of ?u with the norm of the function\n\nu itself. Since we will only use this estimates for ? such that\n\n? = 0 in ?pQ(?,?),\n\nwe will suppose this now, just for simpli?cation. The di?culty without this assump-\n\ntion is the same, but unnecessary terms appear.\n\nProposition 2.7 (Local energy estimates). Let u be a local weak solution of (PME),\n\nk,l ?

If we can show that the oscillation converges to zero as the cylinders\n\nshrink to the point, we can derive the continuity of the solution. In this regard, it is\n\nusual to prove that the oscillation is reduced by a factor ? ? (0, 1) in each iteration,\n\ni.e. ?n+1 ? ??n, where ? is the oscillation in the nth cylinder. This method is\n\nnamed Reduction of Oscillation. We will de?ne and prove rigorously this result in\n\nthe following sections.\n\nThis iterative procedure can be done using the a priori estimates that we obtained\n\nbefore. As is explained in my previous work [13], De Giorgi proved the H\u00f6lder\n\ncontinuity for weak solutions of elliptic equations, and the idea now is to try to\n\ngeneralize his work to parabolic equations.\n\nFor some simple equations, as the Heat equation,\n\nut ? ?u = 0, (HE)\n\n21\n\n\n\nChapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling\n\nthe standard parabolic cylinders\n\nQ(R2,R)\n\nre?ect the natural homogeneity between the space and time variables. Indeed, the\n\nheat equation involves one derivative with respect to the time variable, but two\n\nderivatives with respect to the space variables. Consequently, we see that if, u\n\nsolves the heat equation, (HE), then so does u(?x,?2t) for ? ? R. This scaling\n\nindicates that the equation remains invariant through a transformation of the space-\n\ntime variables that leaves constant the ratio\n|x|2\nt\n.\n\nFor more complicated equations like our degenerate parabolic equation (PME),\n\nwe need di?erent cylinders.\n\n3.1. A geometry for the equation\n\nThe idea behind the method of intrinsic scaling is to perform the iterative process\n\nin cylinders that re?ect the structure/geometry of the equation. These cylinders need\n\nto be constructed taking into account the nature of the degeneracy or singularity,\n\nand the oscillation of the solution itself (thus, the term intrinsic). They should triv-\n\nially reduce to the standard parabolic cylinders, re?ecting the natural homogeneity\n\nbetween the space and time variables for the heat equation.\n\nFor our equation, (PME), and for most degenerate or singular equations, the\n\nenergy and logarithmic estimates are not homogeneous since they involve integral\n\nnorms corresponding to di?erent powers. In our case, some undesirable factors, as\n\num?1, appear. However, if we analyse the estimates in a geometry dictated by its\n\nown degenerate structure, using the rescaled cylinders, we can accommodate the\n\ndegeneracy and restore the homogeneity in the energy and logarithmic estimates.\n\nIn this regard, we can say that the equation behaves, in its own geometry, like\n\nthe heat equation.\n\nIf we suppose for a moment that u > 0, we can rewrite equation (PME) in the\n\nfollowing form\n\nu1?m\n\nm\nut ? ?u = 0.\n\nRegardless of the unrealistic assumption, this equation allows us to predict that it is\n\npossible to recover the homogeneity of the function using a scaling factor. Despite\n\nthis scaling factor being dependent on the solution itself, it gives us an idea of how\n\nto construct the rescaled cylinders.\n\n22\n\n\n\n3.1 A geometry for the equation\n\nThe main objective of this chapter is to implement, in a rigorous way, this heuris-\n\ntic reasoning. For that, let us see how to choose the cylinders that better re?ect the\n\ngeometry of our equation.\n\nFrom now on, for brevity, where no confusion is to be feared, we will always\n\nassume that u is a nonnegative local weak solution of (PME).\n\nFirst let us choose 0 &lt;R &lt;1, such that\n\nQ(4R2??, 2R) ? ?T , 0 &lt;? &lt;1,\n\nand de?ne\n\n\u00b5+ := ess sup\nQ(4R2??,2R)\n\nu and \u00b5? := ess inf\nQ(4R2??,2R)\n\nu.\n\nAt this point, we can de?ne the ? as the essential oscillation of the solution u\n\nwithin this cylinder,i.e.,\n\n? = ess osc\nQ(4R2??,2R)\n\nu = \u00b5+ ?\u00b5?.\n\nFinally, let us construct the rescaled cylinder\n\nQ(?1?mR2,R) = KR(0) \u00d7 (??1?mR2, 0),\n\nwhich, if we assume\n\n?m?1 > R?, (3.1)\n\nis contained in Q(4R2??, 2R) and consequently in ?T .\n\n23\n\n\n\nChapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling\n\nIndeed, if (3.1) does not hold, we have that the oscillation is comparable to the\n\nradius, ? ? R?(1?m), and the H\u00f6lder continuity follows immediately.\n\nThis inclusion implies that\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mR2,R)\n\nu ? ?,\n\nwhich will be the starting point of the recursive scheme.\n\nWe will also assume, without loss of generality, that\n\n\u00b5?&lt;\n?\n\n4\n. (3.2)\n\nIndeed, if (3.2) is not veri?ed then the equation will not have any degeneracy, but\n\nthis case will be studied better in section 4.2 anyway.\n\n3.2. Reduction of the oscillation\n\nAt this point, to prove the highly-anticipated reduction of oscillation, we have to\n\nconsider two alternatives. The proof will be divided in two complementary cases:\n\neither u is essentially away from its in?mum in Q(?1?mR2,R), or u is essentially\n\naway from its supremum. However, in both cases, we can reach identical conclusions.\n\nLet us state both alternatives in a precise way.\n\nConsider a constant, ?0 ? (0, 1), that will be determined later. Then either, the\n\n?rst alternative,\n\n|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) &lt;u? + ?\n2\n}|\n\n|Q(?1?mR2,R)|\n? ?0, (3.3)\n\nholds, or\n|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) ? \u00b5? + ?\n\n2\n}|\n\n|Q(?1?mR2,R)|\n&lt;1 ??0,\n\nwhich, since \u00b5+ ? ?\n2\n\n= \u00b5? + ?\n2\n, implies the second alternative\n\n|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) > \u00b5+ ? ?\n2\n}|\n\n|Q(?1?mR2,R)|\n&lt;1 ??0. (3.4)\n\n3.2.1. The ?rst alternative\n\nLet us start to analyse our problem assuming that the ?rst alternative holds.\n\nProposition 3.1. Assume (3.2) is in force. If the ?rst alternative (3.3) holds , then\n\nu(x,t) > \u00b5? +\n?\n\n4\n, a.e. in Q\n\n(\n?1?m\n\n(\nR\n\n2\n\n)2\n,\nR\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\n24\n\n\n\n3.2 Reduction of the oscillation\n\nProof. Let us start by de?ning the sequence\n\nRn =\nR\n\n2\n+\n\nR\n\n2n+1\n, n = 0, 1....,\n\nthat converges to R\n2\n. Then we can construct the family of nested and shrinking\n\ncylinders Q(?1?mR2n,Rn) and, for each cylinder, let us consider a piecewise smooth\n\ncuto? function 0 ? ?n ? 1 satisfying the following assumptions:\n\n?n = 1 in Q\n(\n?1?mR2n+1,Rn+1\n\n)\n; ?n = 0 on ?Q\n\n(\n?1?mR2n,Rn\n\n)\n;\n\n|??n| ?\n2n?1\n\nR\n; 0 ? (?n)t ?\n\n22n?2\n\nR2\n?m?1; ??n ?\n\n22n?2\n\nR2\n.\n\nThen, we will use the energy estimates (2.4) for (ul? ?kn)?, with l = \u00b5? +\n?\n4\n,\n\nkn = \u00b5\n? +\n\n?\n\n4\n+\n\n?\n\n2n+1\n\nand ? = ?n.\n\nFor the left hand side of the inequality, since ul? = max{u,\u00b5?+\n?\n4\n}? \u00b5?+ ?\n\n4\n? ?\n\n4\n,\n\nthe following lower bound can be found:\n\ness sup\n\n?

For that purpose, we just need to notice the following\n\nfour properties of our functions and constants, with ? symbolizing the characteristic\n\nfunction:\n\n1. 0 ? \u00b5? ? ?\n4\n, so u ? 5?\n\n4\nand l ? ?\n\n2\n, which implies that ul? ?\n\n5?\n4\n;\n\n2. l = \u00b5? + ?\n4\n&lt;kn, so ?[u?l] ? ?[u<kn] = ?[(u?kn)?>0];\n\n3. Where ul? = u, we have ?[(u?kn)?>0] = ?[(ul??kn)?>0]\n, but even when ul? = l,\n\ni.e., u ? l &lt;kn, the same result holds: ?[(u?kn)?>0] = 0 = ?[(l?kn)?>0] =\n\n?[(ul??kn)?>0]\n.

If \u00b5? ???, then ?u is a nonnegative solution and we apply\n\nthe method to ?u. Notice that ?u will verify the second alternative instead, but the\n\nresult obtained is equivalent. Contrarily of what the reader could think, the change\n\nof equation does not arise any issue because the essential oscillation is the same for\n\nboth.\n\nNext we will explore the case where ?? &lt;\u00b5? &lt;??\n4\n. In fact, for this assumption,\n\nthere is no degeneracy on {(ul? ? kn)? > 0}, so everything should work without\n\nsigni?cant modi?cations.\n\n(a) Nonnegative solutions (b) Solutions with ?? &lt;\u00b5? &lt;??\n4\n\nFigure 3.1: In these two graphics we want to represent the bounds of (ul? ?kn)?.\n\nHowever, let us study which adjustments are needed d so the proof remains\n\nformally correct. We start to choose n? such that \u00b5\n? + ??\n\n4\n? ?\n\n2n?+1\nand de?ne\n\nkn = \u00b5? +\n?\n4\n\n+ ?\n2n+n?\n\n.\n\nAt this point we can obtain the following lower bound to |ul?|on{(ul??kn)? > 0},\n\n|ul?| ? ?kn ?\n?\n\n2n?\n. For the upper bound, just notice that |ul?| ? max{|l|,\u00b5+} ?\n\n3?\n4\n\nand the rest remains the same. Some minor things would also need to be changed\n\nbecause of n?, but since it is constant it does not bring major di?culties. Just one\n\nmore problem arises, in this case X0 ? ?0 is not equivalent to the ?rst alternative.\n\nHowever, since k0&lt;\n?\n2\n, the ?rst alternative implies the initial condition for the\n\nconvergence.\n\nFor ??\n4\n&lt;\u00b5? &lt;0, again there is no degeneracy on {(ul? ?kn)? > 0} as we can\n\nobserve in Figure 3.2.\n\nThis is a simpler case, since ul? > 0 and because there exists a n? such that\n\nl > ?\n2n?\n\n; the proof follows identically.\n\n29\n\n\n\nChapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling\n\nFigure 3.2: Bounds of (ul? ?kn)? for solutions with ?\n?\n4\n&lt;\u00b5? &lt;0.\n\nIn the last case, \u00b5? = ?\n4\n, we will prove the same result but for a di?erent ?.

To prove this lemma we will apply the logarithmic inequality (2.6) to the\n\nfunction (u?k)+ in the cylinder Q(t0,R), with\n\nk = \u00b5+ ?\n?\n\n2\nand c =\n\n?\n\n2n+1\n,\n\nfor some n ?

It is possible to apply\n\nthe logarithmic estimate with this constants because we can assume that\n\nH+u,k := ess sup\nx?Q(R,t0)\n\n???(u?\u00b5+ + ?\n2\n\n)+\n\n??? > ?\n4\n?\n\n?\n\n2n+1\n;\n\notherwise the lemma would be trivial for the choice of q = 2.\n\nSince u ? 5\n4\n?, the logarithmic inequality (2.6) implies that\n\nsup\nt0?t?0\n\n?\nKR\u00d7{t}\n\n[?+(u)]2?2dx ?\n?\nKR\u00d7{t0}\n\n[?+(u)]2?2dx\n\n+ C\n\n? 0\nt0\n\n?\nKR\n\n?m?1?+(u)|??|2dxdt. (3.9)\n\nAs in the previous proposition, the next step is to bound the terms of the previous\n\ninequality. For that, we will need some initial calculations again. Let us start by\n\nremembering that ?+(u) is de?ned in the whole cylinder Q(t0,R), and it is given by\n\n?+\n{H+\n\nu,k\n,k, ?\n\n2n+1\n}\n(u) =\n\n????\n???\n\nln\n\n(\nH+\nu,k\n\nH+\nu,k\n?u+k+ ?\n\n2n+1\n\n)\nif u > k + ?\n\n2n+1\n,\n\n0 if u ? k + ?\n2n+1\n\n.\n\nIn addition, in this cylinder, we have that\n\nu?k ?

(3.11)\n\nLastly, we will choose our cuto? function 0 ? ?(x) ? 1 de?ned in KR such that,\n\nfor some ? ? (0, 1),\n\n?(x) = 1, for x ? K(1??)R and |??| ? (?R)\n?1.\n\n31\n\n\n\nChapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling\n\nWe are now ready to bound the right hand side terms in (3.9). As ?+(u) = 0 on\n\nthe set {x ? KR : u(x, \u00b7) ? \u00b5+ ? ?2}, by (3.8) and (3.11), the ?rst term of the right\n\nhand side of (3.9) is bounded by?\nKR\u00d7{t0}\n\n[?+]2?2dx ? n2 ln(2)2\n(\n\n1 ??0\n1 ??0/2\n\n)\n|KR|.\n\nUsing (3.11) again and the fact that ?t0 ?

Similarly to the proof of the ?rst alternative, we start by de?ning the sequence\n\nRn =\nR\n\n2\n+\n\nR\n\n2n+1\n, n = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,\n\nand to construct the family of nested and shrinking cylinders Q(?1?mR2n,Rn).

Assume that (3.2) is in force. If the\n\nsecond alternative (3.7) holds, then there exists a constant ?2 ? (0, 1), depending\n\nonly on the data, such that\n\ness sup\nQ\n(\n?0\n2\n?1?m( R2 )\n\n2\n,R\n2\n\n) u ? ?2?. (3.17)\n\nProof. This proof is similar to the proof of Corollary 3.2. By Proposition 3.5,\n\nthere exists s0 ? N such that\n\ness sup\nQ\n(\n?0\n2\n?1?m( R2 )\n\n2\n,R\n2\n\n) u ? \u00b5+ ? ?2s0\nand thus\n\ness osc\nQ\n(\n?1?m( R2 )\n\n2\n,R\n2\n\n) u ? \u00b5+ ? ?\n2s0\n?\u00b5?\n\n=\n\n(\n1 ?\n\n1\n\n2s0\n\n)\n?.\n\nThis way, the corollary follows with ?2 =\n(\n1 ? 1\n\n2s0\n\n)\n.\n\nRemark 3.7. For the signed PME, there is no need to study the second alternative.\n\nAs we referred before, if u veri?es the second alternative, then ?u will verify the\n\n?rst alternative and this case is already studied. Notice that the essential oscillation\n\nof u and ?u are the same so it is equivalent to prove the previous corollary for u or\n\n39\n\n\n\nChapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling\n\n?u. Since the PME is a particular case of the signed PME, it could seem that the\n\nsecond alternative should never be necessary. However, notice that to prove the ?rst\n\nalternative for the signed PME we used a nonnegative solution of the original PME.\n\nSo both alternatives are always necessary.\n\n40\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe H\u00f6lder continuity\n\nAt this point, using Corollaries 3.2 and 3.6 we can easily prove the general\n\nreduction of oscillation. This result will be the basis of our ?nal iterative scheme\n\nthat will prove the H\u00f6lder Continuity of weak solutions of the PME.\n\nProposition 4.1. Assume (3.2) is in force; then there exists a constant ? ? (0, 1),\n\ndepending only on the data, such that\n\ness sup\nQ\n(\n?0\n2\n?1?m( R2 )\n\n2\n,R\n2\n\n) u ? ??. (4.1)\n\nProof. Since ?0\n2\n&lt;1,\n\nQ\n\n(\n?0\n2\n?1?m\n\n(\nR\n\n2\n\n)2\n,\nR\n\n2\n\n)\n? Q\n\n(\n?1?m\n\n(\nR\n\n2\n\n)2\n,\nR\n\n2\n\n)\n,\n\nand by Corollaries 3.2 and 3.6, we just need to choose ? = max{?1,?2} to ?nish\n\nthe proof .\n\n4.1. The Recursive Argument\n\nWe ?nally prove the H\u00f6lder continuity for weak solutions through an iterative\n\nscheme based on all previous results.\n\nLemma 4.2. There exist constants ? > 1 and ? ? (0, 1), that can be determined a\n\npriori in terms of the data, such that for all 0 &lt;r ? R ,\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mr2,r)\n\nu ? ??\n( r\nR\n\n)?\n.\n\nProof. Let us start by de?ning\n\nRk = c\nk\n0R, c0 =\n\n1\n\n2\n?\nm?1\n\n2\n\n(?0\n2\n\n)\n<\n\n1\n\n2\n,\n\n41\n\n\n\nChapter 4 The H\u00f6lder continuity\n\nfor k = 0, 1, 2 . . ., where ? is given by Proposition 4.1. Since we are supposing that\n\n?m?1 > R?,\n\nfor k = 0, we have that our initial condition\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mR20,R0)\n\nu ? ess osc\nQ(R2??0 ,R0)\n\nu ? ?\n\nis veri?ed.\n\nFor k = 1, by (4.1), we also have that\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mR21,R1)\n\nu ? ess osc\nQ(?1?mR21,\n\nR\n2 )\nu ? ?? = ?1.\n\nRepeating all the process again starting in Q\n(\n?1?mR21,R1\n\n)\n, with ?1 = ??, we\n\ncan deduce inductively that, for all k = 0, 1, 2 . . .,\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mR2k,Rk)\n\nu ? ?k = ?k?.\n\nIn addition, for every 0 &lt;r ? R, there exists some k such that\n\nRc\n(k+1)\n0 ? r ? Rc\n\nk\n0,\n\nso, if we choose ? =\nlog ?\nlog c0\n\n> 0, we arrive at\n\n?k+1 ?\n( r\nR\n\n)?\n,\n\nwhich means that\n\ness osc\nQ(?1?mr2,r)\n\nu ? ess osc\nQ(?1?mR2k,Rk)\n\nu ? ?k? ? ??\n( r\nR\n\n)?\n,\n\nwith ? = ??1.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can also suppose that ? > 1\n2\n, which implies that\n\n? ? (0, 1).\n\nFinally, we can easily prove the ?rst part of the main theorem rigorously.\n\nTheorem 4.3. Assume (3.2) is in force. Let u be a nonnegative bounded local weak\n\nsolution of (PME) in ?T and M = ||u||?,?T . Then u is locally H\u00f6lder continuous\n\nin ?T .\n\nProof. Let us start by ?xing (x,ti) ? K, i = 1, 2, with t2 > t1 and constructing the\n\ncylinder\n\nS = (x,t2) + Q(R\n2,R).\n\n42\n\n\n\n4.1 The Recursive Argument\n\nSince ?T there is a constant l such that dist(K; ?p?T ) &lt;l for every compact set\n\nK. This fact implies that if we choose\n\nR =\n1\n\n2l\ndist(K; ?p?T ),\n\nthen S ? ?T and R &lt;1.\n\nMoreover, supposing that\n\nt2 ? t1 &lt;R2,\n\nit is possible to choose\n\nr = |t2 ? t1|\n1\n2 ? (0,R).\n\nWe can then apply Lemma 4.2 to\n\n(x,t2) + Q(?\n1?mr2,r)\n\nand conclude that\n\n|u(x,t1) ?u(x,t2)| ? ??(2l)?\n(\n|t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n= C\n\n(\n|t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n.\n\nOn the other hand, if t2 ? t1 ? R2, we have that\n\n2l|t2 ? t1|\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n? 1,\n\nwhich implies that\n\n|u(x,t1) ?u(x,t2)| ? 2M ? 2M(2l)?\n(\n|t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n= C\n\n(\n|t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n.\n\nIdentically, we can prove the H\u00f6lder continuity in the space variables,i.e., for all\n\n(xi, t) ? K, i = 1, 2\n\n|u(x1, t) ?u(x2, t)| ? C\n(\n|x2 ?x1|\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n.\n\nTo ?nish the proof we can use both inequality to arrive at\n\n|u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t2)| = |u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t1) + u(x2, t1) ?u(x2, t2)|\n\n? C\n\n?\n?( |x2 ?x1|\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n+\n\n(\n|t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)???\n? C\n\n(\n|x2 ?x1| + |t2 ? t1|\n\n1\n2\n\ndist(K; ?p?T )\n\n)?\n,\n\nfor all (xi, t) ? K, i = 1, 2.\n\n43\n\n\n\nChapter 4 The H\u00f6lder continuity\n\nWe thus complete the application of the intrinsic scaling method, remaining just\n\nto prove this result when (3.2) does not hold.\n\nRemark 4.4. These last proofs just depend on the Reduction of the Oscillation, and\n\nnot on the equation itself. Since in the previous remarks we described how to extend\n\nthe Reduction of the Oscillation result for the signed PME, at this point we can also\n\nstate that weak solutions of the signed PME, (2.1), are locally H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\n4.2. Uniformly parabolic equation\n\nLet us consider the case when (3.2) does not hold and the in?mum is not com-\n\nparatively small, i.e.,\n\n\u00b5? >\n?\n\n4\n>\nR?\n\n4\n,\n\nand consequently u ? C > 0 in Q(4R2??, 2R).\n\nIn this case, the porous media equation does not have any degeneracy. In fact,\n\nit is simply a parabolic equation in Q(4R2??, 2R), and this type of equations had al-\n\nready been studied in detail [12]. Remember that, in the introduction, we introduced\n\nthe evolution equation,\n\nut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = 0,\n\nwith A measurable and subject to the structure conditions???\n??\nA(x,t,u,?u) \u00b7?u ? ?(x,t,u,?u)|?u|2\n\n|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? |?(x,t,u,?u)||?u|,\n\nwhere ? and ? are given functions. We also highlighted that, if there exist two\n\npositive constants ?0 ? ?1, such that\n\n?0 ? ?(x,t,u,?u) and ?(x,t,u,?u) ? ?1,\n\nthen the equation is considered to be parabolic.\n\nThe (PME) can be rewritten in the divergence form as\n\nut ?div(mum?1?u) = 0 m > 1,\n\nwhere A = mum?1?u. This means that ?(x,t,u,?u) ? mCm?1 > 0. Since u is\n\nconsidered to be bounded, we also have that ?(x,t,u,?u) ? mMm?1, which implies\n\nthat, in fact, the PME, in this particular case, is uniformly parabolic.\n\nThe theory of this type of equation is already well studied, and the proof of the\n\nH\u00f6lder continuity of weak solutions can be consulted in [12, chapter 5].\n\n44\n\n\n\n4.3 Generalizations\n\n4.3. Generalizations\n\nThe intrinsic scaling method is very versatile and we can adjust it to a great\n\nnumber of singular and degenerate parabolic di?erential equations. As indicated\n\nearlier, the H\u00f6lder continuity is solely a consequence of the a priori estimates and,\n\nfor this reason, the techniques just presented are rather ?exible and adjustable to a\n\nvariety of other equations.\n\nTo highlight this versatility and the strength of this method, we will state two of\n\nthe most important possible generalizations.\n\nAlong the text we already left remarks to demonstrate how we can generalize\n\nthe method to the signed PME, although this results may also be generalized to all\n\nquasilinear equations of porous medium type. This type of equations can be cast in\n\nthe form\n\nut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = b(x,t,u,?u), (4.2)\n\nwhere Ai and b are measurable functions satisfying the following structure assump-\n\ntions: ???????\n??????\nA(x,t,u,?u) \u00b7?u ? C0|u|m ? 1|?u|2 ??0(x,t), m > 0;\n\n|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? C1|u|m?1|?u| + ?1(x,t);\n\n|b(x,t,u,?u)| ? C2|?|u|m|2 + ?2(x,t),\n\nfor a.e. (x,t) ? ?T . The constants Ci are given and positive and the functions ?i\n\nare nonnegative subject to the integrability conditions ?0, ?\n2\n1, ?2 ? L\n\nq,r(?T ) with\n\nq,r ? 1 satisfying, for d ? 2,\n1\n\nr\n+\n\nd\n\n2q\n? (0, 1).\n\nAs we already mentioned, another equation to which the theory applies is the\n\np-Laplace equation (PLE). In fact, it can be extended to equations with the full p-\n\nLaplacian type quasilinear structure, i.e., with the form (4.2) verifying the following\n\nstructure assumptions:\n\n???????\n??????\nA(x,t,u,?u) \u00b7?u ? C0|?u|p ??0(x,t), m > 0;\n\n|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? C1|?uu|p?1 + ?1(x,t);\n\n|b(x,t,u,?u)| ? C2|?u|p + ?2(x,t),\n\nwith similar conditions for Ci and ?i.\n\nIt is possible to ?nd in the literature even more equations, and for that case we\n\nrefer the reader to [5] and [6].\n\n45\n\n\n\nChapter 4 The H\u00f6lder continuity\n\n46\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe goal initially proposed was successfully achieved. Although some ideas were\n\nnot presented or even studied we were able to show the powerful method of intrinsic\n\nscaling.\n\nAlong this project we went trough di?erent functional analysis techniques, trying\n\nto achieve a balance between explaining them thoroughly without losing the focus of\n\nthe general idea. Overall, we believe this balance was successfully achieved, making\n\nthis work not hard to follow and at same time self-contained.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the method and to ease comprehension we divided\n\nthis work in several parts. We initially de?ne weak solutions and with them we reach\n\nto two integral inequalities, named a priori estimates. At this point, the method is\n\ncomposed by two similar alternatives. Despite of some slight di?erences in the last\n\npart the arguments are essentially the same for both alternatives. We highlight the\n\nfact that the a priori estimates were the building blocks of the theory, all proofs\n\nstart by its application. Then, we took advantage of the geometry of the equation\n\nchanging our time variable and we start working on the \"geometry and time\" of\n\nthe equation. Finally, after the Reduction of Oscillation has been proved for both\n\nalternatives, we generalized the recursive argument used by De Giorgi in [3], proving\n\nthe H\u00f6lder continuity of the solutions.\n\nApplying the intrinsic scaling method to the PME not only allowed learning about\n\nthe method itself in full depth but also increased our knowledge on the equation and\n\nits geometry.\n\nWe would like to emphasize the fact that that the general idea of supporting\n\nthis work has been published by J. Urbano in 2008 [15]. In this work the H\u00f6lder\n\ncontinuity of the p-Laplace equation has been proved, in this regard we adapted\n\nthe method used to the PME and the signed PME. For that reason, some proofs\n\nare identical but explained in more detail to ease comprehension, while others went\n\nthrough signi?cant adjustments. Several articles [2, 6, 8, 10, 14] were read and some\n\n47\n\n\n\nideas were adapted, however for some small steps original adjustments were needed.\n\nUnfortunately the method applied does not answer all the questions risen by this\n\ntheory. There is still much to discover and many problems to solve. The most famous\n\nunsolved issue related with this theory is the determination of optimal regularity. A\n\nwide number of mathematicians are still trying to understand what is the best H\u00f6lder\n\nregularity for general non-negative solutions, in other words, searching what is the\n\nworst possible case. For one-dimension this problem has been already answered, and\n\noptimal regularity was found [16, chapter 9]. In the case of greater dimensions other\n\nresults were discovered. The application of the maximum principle made it possible\n\nto determine H\u00f6lder estimates with explicit H\u00f6lder exponents. Some others results\n\nwere discovered [9], however the optimal exponent and regularity remains unknown.\n\nSeveral hours were also spent around the better understanding of this open prob-\n\nlem, although no considerable advances were made.\n\nAdditionally this work contributed to improvement of our knowledge on sev-\n\neral topics on nonlinear PDEs. Studying the regularity of weak solutions, made us\n\ntravel trough fascinating themes, including self-similar solutions, free-boundaries, ?-\n\nnite propagation, radial equivalence for the PME and PLE amongst other themes.\n\nThis last subject was of special interest along the year although it has not been\n\nincluded in this work. As it would deviate from the main topic of this dissertation\n\nand the ?nal result was not completed we decided not to include in this work\n\nIn the end remains the feeling that it was impossible to transmit all the knowledge\n\nacquired about all the di?erent areas studied. However, overall we hope with this\n\nmanuscript that valuable ideas were clearly transmitted, in an easy and enjoyable\n\nway.\n\n48\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] E. Di Benedetto.
