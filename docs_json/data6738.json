The first three pulses are well represented in most Neopro-\nterozoic structural provinces in West Gondwana. The youngest \norogenic phase/pulse, however, is only seen in Argentina (Pampe-\nan Orogeny) and Brazil, in eastern Rio de Janeiro State (B\u00fazios \nOrogeny). The period between ca. 750 and 500 Ma is compara-\nble to that reported for the amalgamation of various continental \nfragments in East (Arabian-Nubian, Mozambique, Kuunga) and \nNorth Gondwana (Cadomian). However, important differences \nin the nature and ages of events are recognized, which can be \nexpected in view of the magnitude of Gondwana agglutination \nand the diversity of paleogeographic and tectonic scenarios. West \nGondwana shows an interesting peculiarity: lithologically and \ntectonically diversified Tonian terranes underlie Brasiliano oro-\ngenic buildups. They\u00a0were strongly reworked during most of the \norogenic pulses. The Tonian terranes (1000 \u2013 900 Ma) and their \nrelation with Rodinia or with the processes of Gondwana fusion \nremains an open question. Indications of their presence in East \nGondwana are still poorly documented.\nKEYWORDS: West Gondwana; Cryogenian; Ediacaran; orogenic \ncollage; orogenic pulses; Tonian terranes.\n\nRESUMO: Consoante os mais recentes dados geol\u00f3gicos e geocronol\u00f3gicos \ndo embasamento da Plataforma Sul-Americana, a colagem orog\u00eanica Brasi-\nliana se deu em quatro pulsos distintos: a) eocriogeniana (ca. 800 \u2013 70Ma); \nb)\u00a0tardicriogeniana-eoediacarana (ca. 660 \u2013 610 Ma); c) eo-m\u00e9dio ediacarana \n(ca. 590 \u2013 560 Ma) e d) tardicambriana (520 \u2013 500 Ma). Os tr\u00eas primeiros \npulsos da colagem apresentam boa representatividade na maioria das prov\u00edn-\ncias estruturais do Neoproteroz\u00f3ico, em todo Gondwana Ocidental. O \u00faltimo \ne mais jovem pulso orog\u00eanico constitui casos espec\u00edficos locais registrados na \nArgentina (Orogenia Pampeana) e no Brasil, no leste do Rio de Janeiro (Oro-\ngenia B\u00fazios).

These seminal \nconcepts were heavily based on Rb-Sr and K-Ar geochro-\nnology, the only methods available at that time. The poor \ndating was made worse by the non-uniform availability of \nthe data over the South American territory. These defini-\ntions were also strongly biased by poor geological and geo-\ntectonic knowledge, associated to the need to establish the \ntiming of geological/geotectonic processes in South America \n(see a synthesis of original definitions in Brito Neves et\u00a0al. \n1990, and in Tab. 1).\n\nWith the progress of systematic geological mapping, \nstrongly supported by recent aerogeophysical surveys, and \nintroduction of new isotopic and geochronological meth-\nods, especially Sm-Nd and U-Pb (Pb-Pb evaporation, TIMS, \nLA-ICPMS, SHRIMP), those concepts adopted during \nthe last decades of the past century need to be reviewed \nand updated. As new data is being rapidly produced, new \nreviews may be necessary in the near future\n\nThe misuse of one of the older designations, the \n\u201cTransamazonian\u201d cycle (ca. 2,100 \u2013 1,800 Ma), is per-\nsistent in Brazilian literature. With the improvement of \ngeological knowledge in the last decades, it has been recog-\nnized that all systems of the Paleoproterozoic era are well \nrepresented in the continent (Brito Neves, 2011). Therefore, \nchoosing a single unifying rack (the \u201cTransamazonian\u201d) to \ninclude all the different systems is both undesirable and \ninconsistent, although understandable in the past. Even \nfor Amazonia, in northern South America, the accumu-\nlated geological knowledge \u2014 according to Santos 2003; \nTassinari and Macambira 2004; Rosa Costa et\u00a0al. 2006; \nCordani and Teixeira 2007, among many others \u2014 is suf-\nficient to place the initial concept of \u201cTransamazonian\u201d in a \nuntenable position, since isotopic determinations originally \nlabeled as \u201cTransamazonian\u201d (ca.\u00a02,000 Ma) are restricted to \na small area in the northeastern part of the Amazonian cra-\nton. Likewise, using the same designation in other basement \nblocks (e.g. S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, Rio de La Plata Craton, \nS\u00e3o Luis Craton, basement of Neoproterozoic provinces, \netc.), is inadequate, given that these blocks, or plates, were \n\n\u2014 probably \u2014 distant from each other, and unlikely to \nhave shared a single cycle of plate interaction.\n\nThe \u201cUrua\u00e7uano cycle\u201d (ca. 1,300-1,100 Ma) proposal \nwas consolidated in the same publication of Almeida et\u00a0al. \n(1973), although it was present in several earlier studies, in \nother structural provinces of South America. This was an \ninterpretive mistake of geological and isotopic data (mostly \nRb-Sr and K-Ar), which gradually disappeared from the sci-\nentific archive of the continent, due to the growth in the \ngeological knowledge of the region.\n\nAt that time, it was a common practice to take a few \ngroups of age and \u201cvalidate\u201d them as a tectonic \u201ccycle\u201d. \nThis\u00a0was done without the necessary commitment to paleo-\ngeographic and paleotectonic scenarios. Concepts such as \n\u201ccycle\u201d, \u201cphase\u201d, \u201corogeny\u201d, and \u201ctectonic event\u201d were used \nloosely, without commiting to a ruling principle. Additionally, \nthere was the widespread unduly idea of a continent (South \nAmerica) always acting as a large monolithic continental \nmass, which is not adequate.\n\nAs far as the Brasiliano \u201ccycle\u201d and the Neoproterozoic \nstructural provinces are concerned, new information is con-\ntinuously being produced. A few subdivisions have been \nproposed (e.g. Campos Neto 2000; Schobbenhaus &amp; Brito \nNeves 2003; Silva et\u00a0al. 2005), with very good scientific \nsupport, providing valuable aid to the approach proposed \nin the present paper.\n\n Scientific progress is instrumental to challenge inad-\nequate concepts and subdivisions. In addition to that, \nadvances in geological knowledge have gradually demon-\nstrated the existence of other major tectonic events associ-\nated to the concept of interaction of several paleocontinents \n(e.g. those from the Siderian, Tonian, Cambrian, among \nothers), barely hypothesized or imagined during the last \nquarter of the past century.\n\nThe interesting question posed by Collins et\u00a0al. (2011), \nin the XIV Gondwana Symposium, about the final assem-\nbly of Gondwana (\u201cWhere and when did Gondwana \nfinally amalgamate?\u201d) seems to have a good answer based \non the most remarkable record in South America. A review \nof the\u00a0different main phases (pulses) of convergent plate \ninteractions during the Neoproterozoic and the final fusion \nof West Gondwana in late Cambrian times are the main \nobjectives of this work.\n\nPREVIOUS STUDIES\n\nSince the late 1960s several authors (e.g. Cordani et\u00a0al. \n1968) have attempted to summarize and organize the avail-\nable geological and geochronological information, trying \nto subdivide the pre-Ordovician in the South American \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n494\n\nThe Brasiliano collage in South America: a review \n\n\n\nplatform. In the 1970s, several classic papers were pub-\nlished (Almeida 1971, 1978; Almeida et\u00a0al. 1973; Cordani \n1973), in which the Neoproterozoic orogenic activity was \nencompassed in the so-called \u201cBrasiliano\u201d (between 700 \nand 450\u00a0Ma, Almeida et\u00a0al. 1973). This is a sequence of \nrelevant contributions, each successively taking advantage \nof the progress of the knowledge (Tab. 1).\n\nContributions by Schobbenhaus and Campos (1984) and \nAlmeida and Hasui (1984), although sticking to the rules \nof international committees, and taking hold of the\u00a0conti-\nnent as a whole, brought about advances to the proposals \nof the previous decade. As mentioned above, Brito Neves \net\u00a0al. (1990) presented a synthesis of these classifications \nand systematizations (Tab. 1).\n\nParguasa \u2013 Paraense\nevents\n\nUrua\u00e7uano structures\n\nAlmeida, 1971\n\nU\nP\nP\nE\nR\n\nP\nR\nE\nC\nA\nM\nB\nR\nI\nA\nN\n\nAlmeida et al., 1973Almeida et al., 1973 Martin, 1978 (coord.)\n\n0.57 Ga\n\nLate Brasiliano Cycle\n(0.62 \u2013 0.57 Ga)\n\n Brasiliano Cycle\n(0.7 \u2013 0.45 Ga)\n\n Brasiliano Cycle\n(0.65 \u2013 0.50 Ga)\n\n1.4 \u2013 1.1 Ga\nOrogenic events\n\n Urua\u00e7uano Cycle\n(1.4 \u2013 0.9 Ga)\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n(2.2 \u2013 1.8 Ga)\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n(2.2 \u2013 2.8 Ga)\n\nMiddle and \nLewer Precambrian\n\n>2.2 Ga)\n\nPre-Transamazonian\nevents\n\nBrasiliano Cycle\n(0.9 \u2013 0.62 Ga)\n\nUrua\u00e7uano/Minas Cycle\n(1.3 \u2013 0.9 Ga)\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n(2.2 \u2013 1.8 Ga)\n\nMIDDLE PRECAMBRIAN\n\nLOWER PRECAMBRIAN\n\nEspinha\u00e7o Cycle\n(1.8 \u2013 1.3 Ga)\n\n1.8 Ga\n\n2.6 Ga\n\n Cambrian  \u2013 Ordovician\nEvents\n\nBrazilian Cycle\nBrazilian events\n\nParguazan event\n\nOrinocan tectonism\n(K\u00b4Mudku \u2013 Nigerie)\n\n1.0 Ga\n\n0.65 \u2013 0.62 Ga 0.65 \u2013 0.55 Ga\n\n2.2 \u2013 1.8 Ga\n\n2.7 \u2013 2.5 Ga\n\n2.7 Ga\n\n2.6 Ga\n\n1.4 Ga\n1.2 Ga\n\n1.5 Ga\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n(2.2 \u2013 2.8 Ga)\n\nTransamazonian events\n\nCarichapdan events\n\nArdan events\n\nGurian events\n\n1.8 Ga\n\n2.8 Ga\nJequi\u00e9 event\n\n3.4 \u2013 3.3 Ga\n\nP\nR\nO\nT\nE\nR\nO\nZ\nO\nI\n\nC\n\nA\nR\nC\nH\nE\nN\nZ\nO\nI\nC\n\nAlmeida et al., 1978\n\nInda&amp; Barbosa, 1978\nBrito Neves et al., 1980\n\n0.57 Ga\n\n0.45 Ga\n\n0.68 Ga\n\n0.45 Ga\n\n1.1 Ga\n\nBrasiliano Cycle\n\nTransition stage\n\nBrasiliano\n\nTransamazonian\n\nJequi\u00e9\n\nUrua\u00e7uan\nUrua\u00e7uan\n\nCycle\n\nBrasiliano\n\nCycle\n\nTransamazonian\nCycle\n\nJequi\u00e9\nCycle\n\nJequi\u00e9\nCycle\n\n(2.7-2.6-2.5 Ga\n\nArchean III\n\nArchean II\n\nArchean I\n\n Brasiliano Cycle\n\n Brasiliano Cycle\n(>0.5 Ga)\n\n Brasiliano Cycle\n\n0.9 Ga Events\n\n2.4 Ga\nEvents\n\n Late\nProterozoic\n\nEspinha\u00e7o-Uru\u00e7uano Cycle\n(1.75-1.2)\n\nMiddle\nProterozoic\n\nTrans-amazonian\nCycle\n\n(2.25-1.9-1.8)\nEarly Proterozoic\n\nTrans-Amazonian\nCycle\n\n(2.2-1.8)\nEarly Proterozoic\n\n(Parguazense)\n\n(Uatum\u00e3)\n\nRodonian-Espinha\u00e7o-\nUru\u00e7uan-K\u00b4mudku\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n\nJequi\u00e9-Aruense Cycle\n\nGuriense Cycle\n\nEspinha\u00e7o Cycle\n\nTransamazonian Cycle\n\nJequi\u00e9 Cycle\n\n1.8 Ga\n2.0 Ga\n\n2.6 Ga\n\n3.2 Ga\n\n2.6 Ga\n\nP\nR\nO\nT\nE\nR\nO\nZ\nO\nI\n\nC\n\nP\nA\nL\n\nA\nR\nC\nH\nE\nN\nZ\nO\nI\nC\n\nSchobbenhaus \net al.,1984 (Coord.)\n\nAlmeida &amp; Hasui, 1984 \nEvents/Cycles\n\nBrito Neves et al., 1990\n\nBrasilian DomainPre-Brasilian Domain\n\n1.0 Ga\n\n1.8 Ga\n\n2.9 Ga\n\n> 3.4 Ga\n\n2,55 Ga\n\n2.1 Ga\n\n1.3 Ga\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n1.0 Ga\n\n1.8 Ga\n\n2.5 Ga\n\n3.3 Ga\n\n0.57 Ga\n\n0.9 Ga\nD\n\nC\n\nB\n\nA\n\nGuajar\u00e1\nMirim\n\nCaiabis\"\"\n\nUatum\u00e3\"\"\n\nBeneficiente\"\"\n\nSuns\u00e1s Cycle\n(1.3/1.28-0.9)\n\nS.

From then on, the number of relevant contri-\nbutions grew and led to rapid progress.\n\nThe new data represented the starting point for new \nschemes of geological time subdivision in the continent \n(Schobbenhaus &amp; Brito Neves 2003; Delgado et\u00a0al. 2003). \nIn both cases, Neoproterozoic tectonic events were consid-\nered with particular care, including the previous proposals \nto subdivide the \u201cBrasiliano\u201d sensu lato. Silva et\u00a0al. (2005), \nconsidering the development of the Mantiqueira Province, \nattempted to improve and update the scheme proposed by \nDelgado et\u00a0al. (2003). These contributions provide excel-\nlent synthesis of geochronological data available for the \nProterozoic of the continent. In addition, they provided the \nfirst attempts to organize the \u201cBrasiliano\u201d geological record \nin space and time.\n\nDefining orogenic processes, taking into account geolog-\nical time subdivision and main stages supported by tectonic \nevents, is a complex and demanding exercise, and it needs \nto be carried out permanently. Timely revisions are neces-\nsary to keep track of knowledge advancement.\n\nPLATE INTERACTIONS, OROGENY, \nOROGENIC COLLAGE, FUSION \n\n(ASSEMBLY)\n\nThere is no consensus in the international literature con-\ncerning the definition of the concepts above. They are simply \noverlooked, or in some cases, treated frivolously. However, \nin our view and experience, attempts to understand the geo-\ntectonic development of continents, following the initial \nassumptions of Mitchell and Reading (1969), Dewey and \nBird (1970) and Dewey and Burke (1973), as suggested by \nHelwig (1974), and again by Seng\u00f6r (1990), is very useful \nin the systematization of tectonic processes. According to \nHelwig (1974) and Seng\u00f6r (1990), orogenesis is defined as a \nplate interaction (development of a Wilson cycle), orogenic \ncollage is a concatenated sequence of orogenies, and fusion \nis the sum of these processes, leading to the formation of a \nlarge continental mass or a supercontinent.\n\nAs mentioned above, several geoscientists, including \nauthors of textbooks, do not follow any robust systematics, \nand the consolidation of these concepts is usually missing \u2014 \nsee Moores and Twiss 1995; der Pluijm and Marshak 2004; \nKearey et\u00a0al. 2009, among other more recent textbooks \u2014, \nwhich leaves room for many inferences and counterintuitive \n\nSchobbenhaus &amp; Bellizzia, 2000 Silva et al., 2005*\n\nSyn \u2013 collisional 530 \u2013 500 Ma (S and I types)\n\nAra\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogeny\n\nPost  \u2013  Collisional    560 \u2013 490 Ma\n\nSyn  \u2013  Collisional     580 \u2013 560 Ma\n\nPre  \u2013  Collisional     630  \u2013  570 Ma\n\nS\u00e3o Gabriel Orogeny\n\nDom Feliciano, Rio Pi\u00ean, Paranapiacaba and\nCosteiro Granitic Belt\n\n600  \u2013  560 Ma\n\n640  \u2013  600 Ma\n\nLate to post \u2013 Collisional\n\nPre to Syn \u2013 Collisional\n\nT uffs, Metatrondhjemites, metadiorites, \n\ntonalite \u2013 gneiss\n\nBrasiliano Cycle\n\nBrasiliano \nI\n\n810  \u2013 700 Ma\n\nB\nra\n\nsi\nli\n\nan\no \n\nII\nI\n\nB\nra\n\nsi\nli\n\nan\no \n\nII\n\nVentuari-Tapaj\u00f3s\n\nT ransamazonian Cycle\n\nJequi\u00e9 Cycle\n\nCariris V elhos\nSunsas\n\nUrua\u00e7uano\n\nSan Ign\u00e7acio\nRodinian\n\nRio Negro-Juruena\nCycle\n\nTaphrogenic\nProcesses\n\n0.54 Ga\n\n0.95 Ga\n\n1.3 Ga\n\n1.5 Ga\n\n1.8 Ga\n\n1.9 Ga\n\n2.2 Ga\n\n2.5 Ga\n\n2.6 Ga\n\nT able 1 (cont)\n\n(*Based only on Mantiqueira Province)\n\nTable 1.

For instance, in the case of the several orogenies \nof the Appalachian Mountains involving distinct terranes, \narcs and plates, no discrimination is proposed, and the term \norogeny persists until the end of a long and complex evo-\nlution. Orogenic collage should have been used, since the \nassembly of Pangaea was the final result of the processes. \nIndeed this oversimplification (\u201corogenesis\u201d) has been com-\nmon practice, especially when some linearity of orogenic \nprocesses persists.\n\nIn cases where co-linearity and/or contiguity of succes-\nsive orogenic processes are absent, and where interacting \nparticipants (basement inliers, terranes, \u201cstructural highs\u201d, \nshear belts, etc.) are abundant, the simplistic treatment \nhas not been possible or is usually confusing. This is the \ncase of the branching systems of orogens or \u201cmosaic-like \nfolded regions\u201d present not only in Proterozoic terrains (e.g. \nNeoproterozoic structural provinces in Brazil, Baikalian \nprovinces of Asia, etc.), but also in Phanerozoic terrains (e.g. \nEuropean Hercynian, Ural-Mongolia, Alps). In every case \nthere is then the necessity to investigate each of the belts, \ntheir paleogeographic framework, as well as their lithostruc-\ntural and isotopic records, and perform comparison exercises \nin order to achieve meaningful syntheses.\n\nEven recognizing the disregard of formal nomenclature \nand definitions in the Geotectonic literature, for which the \nnecessity of formalization equals that of the stratigraphic \nnomenclature code, we decided to follow the \u201cHelwig \n(1974)\u2013Seng\u00f6r (1990)\u201d proposal, aiming to understand the \nproblems presently posed for South America. We hope to \nestablish a basis for the better appreciation of the problem \nand for its future solution.\n\nPRE-TONIAN IN SOUTH AMERICA\n\nArchean\nEoarchean rocks have not been found in South America \n\nup to now, although there are some indirect records from \nSm-Nd model ages and from rare U-Pb ages of detrital \nzircon grains.\n\nExposures of Paleoarchean high- and low-grade rocks are \nrecognized within the main cratonic nuclei (S\u00e3o Francisco, \nAmazonian), in basement inliers within and between mobile \nbelts, and eventually in detrital zircon grains from Proterozoic \nmetasedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks (> 3.4 Ga) were \nidentified in the central and northern domains of the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco craton (Nutman &amp; Cordani 1993), and in the \nS\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Campestre block (Dantas et\u00a0al. 2004, 2010, \n2013), in the Borborema province. Up to this date, there is \nno sufficient data to try to establish workable tectonic sub-\ndivisions for this era in South America.\n\nMesoarchean records are far more abundant in cratons, \nbasement of Proterozoic mobile belts, as well as in detrital \nmaterial of Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks. However, \nin spite of the available data, it seems still early to suggest \nsubdivisions. Occasionally, some denominations of orogenic \nnature are used \u2014 e.g. \u201cGuriense cycle (Schobbenhaus &amp; \nCampos, 1984) \u2014 to distinguish between different tectonic/\nmetamorphic peaks. Although the increasing volume of \ngeological and geochronological data is recognized, formal \nclassifications should wait until additional data are avail-\nable. In\u00a0addition to that, many Mesoarchean terranes were \nvariably reworked during Proterozoic orogenies, requiring \ncaution when making new propositions.\n\nIn general, among the Archean eras, Neoarchean records \nare the most frequent in the basement of the cratons and the \nProterozoic mobile belts. The wealth of data has lead research-\ners to propose some local designations, such as the \u201cJequi\u00e9 \ncycle\u201d (Cordani 1973), \u201cJequi\u00e9-Aroense\u201d (Schobbenhaus &amp; \nCampos, 1984), and \u201cRio das Velhas\u201d (Noce et\u00a0al. 1998). \nSuch designations express the necessity of knowledge sys-\ntematization, and are understandable, acceptable, and should \nbe stimulated. However, caution should be exercised when \nsuch designations are extended from a specific geological \ndomain to the whole continent.\n\nWith the necessary caution, possible Neoarchean con-\ntinental nuclei in Brazil should be confronted with what is \nknown about Neoarchean rocks worldwide. Indeed, several \nneoarchean continental reconstruction scenarios have been \nsuggested in the literature (e.g. Bleeker 2003): \n\n ? a single continent (Kenoran); \n ? two or three large continental masses (Sclavia, Superia, \n\nVaalbara); or \n ? many different masses, plates and nuclei, which appears to \n\nbe the less probable solution, according to Bleeker (2003). \n\nIn our point of view, this xcenario considered as the \u201cless \nprobable solution\u201d (Bleeker, 2003), involving many different \nneoarchean masses, appears to be the most realistic model \n(taking into consideration the data of the South American \nPlatform).   \n\nPALEOPROTEROZOIC\n\nThere are good lithological and structural records of \nall Paleoproterozoic periods recognized in South America, \nboth from orogenic and anorogenic processes, also includ-\ning basin-forming tectonics (Brito Neves 2011).\n\n Siderian rock units (2,500 \u2013 2,300 Ma) were recently \nidentified in the cratonic basement of the Amazonian and \nLuis Alves cratons, and in basement inliers of Proterozoic \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n497\n\nBenjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.\n\n\n\nbelts, including volcano-sedimentary formations (Brito \nNeves 2011). \n\nThe Rhyacian (2,300 \u2013 2,050 Ma), mainly in its middle \npart (ca. 2,150 \u2013 2,200 Ma), is the Paleoproterozoic time \ninterval with the largest number of tectonic, magmatic and \nsedimentary events recorded in the diverse components of \nthe basement in South America, particularly in its central \nand eastern sectors.\n\nThe Orosirian (2,050 \u2013 1,800 Ma) runs second place \nin terms of record wealth, comprising independent orog-\nenies, all well constrained in their time intervals, but also \nrepresenting the final stages of orogenies that started in the \nRhyacian. Aside from the orogenic processes, important \ngranite plutonism and abundant volcanic and sedimentary \nsequences have been identified. In eastern Amazonia, these \nprocesses were extensive, representing a large igneous prov-\nince (LIP), covering an area that exceeds 1 million km2, in \nfive different countries (Brito Neves 2011; Klein et\u00a0al. 2013).\n\nDuring the Statherian (1,800 \u2013 1,600 Ma), there is a \nsingle orogen in the central sector of the Amazonian cra-\nton, known as the Rio Negro-Juruena belt, exposed to the \nwest of an Orosirian belt. Nd-Sr isotopic evidence points \nto juvenile accretion processes in the origin of this orogen \n(Tassinari &amp; Macambira 2004; Cordani &amp; Teixeira 2007). \nThis orogen is believed to continue into North America \n(Transcontinental-Labrador) and northern Europe (Gothian-\nKongsbergian), according to continental reconstructions put \nforward by several authors (Brito Neves 2005). However, the \nmost outstanding feature of the Statherian in South America \nis taphrogenesis, with many examples in all sectors of the \ncontinent. This is represented by plutonism, volcanism, and \nsedimentation, including precursors of large intracratonic \nsedimentary basins (\u201csteer\u2019s head basins\u201d or koilogens). In \npart, these extensive covers continued to form well into the \nMesoproterozic, for example the Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup in \nthe S\u00e3o Francisco craton. Some of the basins were formed \nin large rift zones, deformed later on during the Late \nMesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic orogenic processes \n(e.g Espinha\u00e7o, Or\u00f3s-Jaguaribe, Ara\u00ed).\n\nMESOPROTEROZOIC\n\nThere are two large geological domains in South America, \nthe Amazonian (or pre-Brasiliano, or north-west domain) \nand the \u201cBrasiliano\u201d (or central-east domain) ones, accord-\ning to Brito Neves and Fuck (2013, 2014). Their distinc-\ntion is easily recognized when analyzing Mesoproterozoic \nand younger rock assemblages (Table 2).\n\nIn the Amazonian domain, the Mesoproterozoic \n(1,600\u00a0\u2013\u00a01,000 Ma) is represented in several NNW-ESE \n\nmobile belts that developed between 1,590 and 1,000 Ma \n(Tab.\u00a02), organized from northeast to southwest in a chelo-\ngenic pattern (Tassinari &amp; Macambira 2004; Bettencourt \net\u00a0al. 2010, among others). The continuity of these belts into \nNorth America is a frequent matter of debate (Brito Neves \n2005; Bettencourt et\u00a0al. 2010; Brito Neves &amp; Fuck 2014, \namong others), especially among researchers investigating \nthe history of supercontinents.\n\nMesoproterozoic magmatic and sedimentary processes \nhave been recorded within the Brasiliano domain. However, \nso far, no true mobile belt has been recognized, except, per-\nhaps, for the Ceres-Rialma belt, exposed along the high course \nof the Tocantins River, in central Brazil (Moraes et\u00a0al. 2004, \n2006). Most units generated during the Mesoproterozoic \nwere strongly affected by Neoproterozoic orogenic events. \nSome restricted cratonic covers escaped this, for instance the \ncentral part of the Chapada Diamantina Group, in the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco craton (S\u00fcssenberger et\u00a0al. 2014). Several examples \nof Mesoproterozoic rift deposits were involved in younger \nBrasiliano mobile belts, many hundreds of million years \nlater (e.g. part of Espinha\u00e7o, Or\u00f3s-Jaguaribe, Ara\u00ed, etc.).\n\nAvailable geological and geochronological information \nindicate that the Mesoproterozoic time scale for the suc-\ncessive orogenic events in Amazonia is distinct from that \nrecorded in the extra-Amazonian portion of the continent \n(Tab. 2). It is not an overstatement to say that the end of the \nMesoproterozoic marks the end of the history of Precambrian \norogenies in Amazonia, since Neoproterozoic events are \nscarce (Brito Neves &amp; Fuck 2013). On the other hand, \nNeoproterozoic systems are of utmost importance outside \nAmazonia, in the so-called Brasiliano domain.\n\nNEOPROTEROZOIC\n\nTonian Terranes/Orogenies\nThe progress of the geological knowledge arising from \n\n1:100.000 and larger scale mapping of almost the whole area \nof the Brasiliano domain and also from abundant isotopic \nstudies, led to the establishment of a much more complete \nscenario of crustal evolution than that described by the pio-\nneering authors mentioned above.\n\nTonian terranes, in the sense of Howell (1995), have been \nidentified in all Neoproterozoic structural provinces of South \nAmerica. They usually represent fractions of Early-Middle \nTonian accretionary \u2014 some juvenile in nature \u2014 and col-\nlisional orogens, including volcanic-sedimentary associations \nmetamorphosed under low- to high-grade conditions. Rock \nassemblages, typical of active continental margins, magmatic \nisland arcs and remnants of ocean floor have been recog-\nnized in these units (e.g. Pimentel &amp; Fuck 1992; Pimentel \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n498\n\nThe Brasiliano collage in South America: a review \n\n\n\net\u00a0al. 1997, 2000, 2004; Pankhurst et\u00a0al. 2008; Santos et\u00a0al. \n2010; Siga Jr. et\u00a0al. 2009, 2011; Van Schmus et\u00a0al. 2011). \nIt is not always possible to reconstruct the paleogeogra-\nphy of these terranes, as they were disrupted during sub-\nsequent Neoproterozoic orogenies. In all cases, it has been \nhard to discriminate them from younger Neoproterozoic \n\nlithostructural and tectonic units, and they have frequently \nbeen interpreted as basement inliers. In general, time lapses \nof hundreds of million years have been recognized between \nthese Tonian terrains and the younger Neoproterozoic pro-\ncesses. The plate configurations and duration of these peri-\nods still need to be accurately established.\n\n \n\nT ONIAN OROGENIES / TERRANES \n(1000 \u2013 0.920 Ma)\n\nV ulcanic, plutonic (felsic and mafic)\ncratogenic processes\n\n+\nCratonic sedimentary sequences\n\nSUNS\u00c1S AGUAPE\u00cd/ HUANCHACA\nOrogenie and cover sequences \n\n(1200 \u2013 1000 Ma)\n\nRONDONIAN  \u2013  SAN IGNACIO\nAccretionary, collisional and cratogenic processes\n\nFirst cratonic sedimentary sequences of western Gondwana\nSILURIAN   \u2013   EARLY DEVONIAN\nCAMBRO   \u2013   ORDOVICIAN\n\nAMAZONIAN DOMAIN\n(Pre-Brasiliano)\n\nBRASILIANO DOMAIN\n\nDiversified late to post tectonic processes:\n\nCAMBRIAN OROGENIC BELTS (0.55 \u2013 0.52 Ga)\n\nMIDDLE EDIACARAN OROGENIES (0.59 \u2013 0.56 Ga)\n\nLATE CRYOGEN \u2013 EARLY EDIACARAN OROGENIES(0.66 \u2013 0.62 Ga)\n\nTransition \nstage\n\nAbsence of orogenic events\n\nANOROG.\nGRANITES\n\n(1510 \u2013 1320 Ma)\n\nSTA.

They extend along ca. 1,000 km from the north of \nJo\u00e3o Pessoa to SW Piau\u00ed, forming a belt up to ca. 100\u00a0km \nwide (the so-called Alto Paje\u00fa terrane + Riacho Gravat\u00e1 \n\u201csubterrane\u201d) and in some other minor occurrences in the \nTransversal (central) and southern domains of the prov-\nince. Volcanic-sedimentary associations, including fel-\nsic, mafic and restricted ultramafic rock associations, as \nwell as orogenic and collisional granites, are dominant. \nIn some cases, arc magmatism displays juvenile geochem-\nical and isotopic signatures (Accioly et\u00a0al. 2010; Santos \net\u00a0al. 2010; Van Schmus et\u00a0al. 2011). These rocks formed \nlargely between 1,050 and 930\u00a0Ma. Tonian rocks are also \nexposed in the north (Bel\u00e9m do S\u00e3o Francisco, Cabrob\u00f3) \nand south (Marranc\u00f3, Po\u00e7o Redondo) of the Pernambuco-\nAlagoas massif, in the northern portion of the Sergipano \nbelt, between the  post-Cryogenian supracrustals and the \nPaleoproterozoic basement of the massif (Oliveira et\u00a0al. \n2010). A wealth of data is available for the Borborema \nTonian rock assemblages (Santos 2010; Van Schmus et\u00a0al. \n\n2011; Caxito et\u00a0al. 2014a, 2014b). According to De Wit \net\u00a0al. (2005, 2008), it is likely that these Tonian units of the \nBorborema Province have also been recognized in the Pan \nAfrican domains, from Cameroon to the south of Sudan.\n\nTocantins province\nThe Goi\u00e1s Magmatic arc is one of the most important \n\ntectonic features of the Bras\u00edlia Belt, in central Brazil. It is \nexposed for approximately 1,000 km in the NNE-SSW \ndirection along the western part of the belt. It comprises \ntwo sectors, separated by the Archean terranes of the Goi\u00e1s \nmassif (see Pimentel et\u00a0al. 2004 and Figs. 2 and 3).\n\nThe southern sector is known as the Aren\u00f3polis arc, and \nthe northern sector, as the Mara Rosa arc (Pimentel et\u00a0al. \n2000; Laux et\u00a0al. 2004, 2005). In both sectors, early evolu-\ntion of the arc took place in Tonian intra-oceanic island arcs, \nbetween ca. 930 and 810 Ma, with the crystallization of very \nprimitive tholeiitic to calc-alkaline volcanics and associated \ntonalites/granodiorites (Fig. 3). The rocks display positive \n?Nd(T) values and Nd TDM model ages mostly between 0.8 \nand 1.1 Ga (Pimentel &amp; Fuck 1992; Pimentel et\u00a0al. 1997, \n2000).

This second cycle also comprises vol-\ncanic-sedimentary sequences, calc-alkaline tonalite-granodi-\norite intrusions, as well as bi-modal intrusions comprised \nof gabbro/diorite/granite. Sm-Nd data produced TDM val-\nues varying in a much wider range, from ca. 0.9 to 2.2 Ga, \nsuggesting a higher contribution/contamination with older \ncontinental crust and indicating that this second event took \nplace in a continental arc. Metamorphism under greenschist \nto amphibolite facies took place at ca. 630-620 Ma. This was \nfollowed by the emplacement of a large volume of post-tec-\ntonic bimodal intrusions formed by gabbros and granites \ndated between ca. 600 and 540 Ma.\n\nAlthough these two main phases of arc magmatism are \nrecognized on the basis of geochronological and, locally, geo-\nphysical data, their spatial distribution is still not clear for \nmost of this geotectonic unit. In a large part, both sectors \n\nof the Goi\u00e1s Magmatic Arc have been strongly affected by \ndextral strike-slip shear zones of the Transbrasiliano-Kandi \nlineament (Schobbenhaus et\u00a0al. 1975; Cordani et\u00a0al. 2013b). \nThis is a striking geologic feature that corresponds to a wide \n(approximately 200-100 km wide) tectonic corridor of con-\ntinental dimensions, cutting through most of South America \nand extending into Africa. The strike-slip faults have dis-\nrupted the arc rock units, causing important displacements \nin the NNE-SSW direction, obliterating the original spatial, \nstructural, and stratigraphic relationships between the two \ndifferent phases of arc magmatism. In addition, younger and \nolder tonalite and granodiorite intrusions, preserved or not \nfrom strong deformation, are virtually identical petrograph-\nically, hampering their distinction in the field. Therefore, \none has to rely on tools such as geochronology and airborne \ngeophysics to distinguish between them. This was partially \nachieved in the Mara Rosa arc, where an appropriate amount \nof Sm-Nd isotopic data allied with U-Pb zircon ages seem to \nindicate that the Tonian rocks (930-800 Ma) dominate the \neastern part of the arc (here informally called the Amaralina \n\nFig. 5\n\no50 o48 46o\n\no16\n\no20\n\no14\n\no18\n\n P\nar\n\nag\nua\n\ny \n+ \n\nAr\nag\n\nua\nia\n\nBe\nlts\n\n100 km\n\nMR\n\nMu\n\nMu\n\nMu\n\nJP\n-S\n\nM\n\nA\n\nAMG\n\nFA\nOg\n\nAx\n\nI\n\nPA\n\nC\n\nV\n\nCr\n\nLD\n\nB\n\nCampos Neto et al. 2008\n\nGx\n\nGx\n\nSc\n\nBRAS\u00cdLIA BELT\n\nS\u00c3O FRANCISCO CRATON\n\nSupracustal groups and metamorphic complexes\n\nMagmatic arcs\n\n     Mafic-ultramafic complexes (ca. 800 Ma)\n\nPA-\n\nC-\n\nV-\n\nI-\n\nAMG-    \n\nGx-\n\nSc-\n\nAx-\n\nFA-\n\nLD-\n\nCr-\n\nParano\u00e1\n\nCanastra\n\nVazantes\n\nIbi\u00e1\n\nA.M.Goi\u00e1s\n\nGuaxup\u00e9\n\nSocorro\n\nArax\u00e1\n\nForeland  assemblages\n\nLima Duarte\n\nCarrancas\n\nMara Rosa (900-800/ 670-600 Ma)MR-\n\nMu-\nJP-SM- Mesoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences\n\nBasement inliers (Archean + Paleoproterozoic)\n\nPelitic-carbonatic covers (Neoproterozoic)\n\nShield areas (Archean+Paleoproterozoic)\n\nAI Anit\u00e1polis-Itau\u00e7u\n\nAI\n\nFrom Valeriano et al.

Geochronological data of amphibolites, \nintercalated with marbles, indicate the crystallization age of \n848\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 Ma for the original mafic magmatism (Heilbron \nand Machado 2003). This is ca. 50 Ma older than the old-\nest age recorded so far in the Rio Negro arc, and more than \n200\u00a0Ma older than the main magmatic activity within the \nmagmatic arc. Metamorphism of the Italva rocks took place \nat higher P-T conditions than that seen in the younger rocks, \nand their contacts are tectonic in nature.\n\nb) Itaiacoca Group\nThe Itaiacoca Group occurs in the westernmost area of \n\nthe Mantiqueira Province, in Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo. It\u00a0is \na ca. 180 km long and > 15 km wide metavolcanic-sedi-\nmentary sequence, exposed between the ca. 620\u00a0Ma old \nCunhaporanga and Tr\u00eas C\u00f3rregos magmatic arcs (Fig.\u00a05). \nThe metamorphic belt is covered in the north and south \nby Phanerozoic deposits of the Paran\u00e1 Basin. It\u00a0is com-\nposed of a QPC-type (quartzite-pelite-carbonate) metased-\nimentary association. Stromatolitic dolomite marble, \nfrequently rich in talc, and phyllite make up the lower \npart of the sequence, followed by quartzite and metavol-\ncanic rocks, with phyllite at the top (Siga Jr. et\u00a0al. 2009, \n2011). The U-Pb zircon age of the Itaiacoca metavolca-\nnics is set at 934 \u00b1 36 Ma, and detrital zircon ages vary \nfrom late Stenian to Early Tonian (Siga Jr. et\u00a0al. 2009, \n2011). The sequence is thought to represent continen-\ntal passive margin deposits related to the Paranapanema \nmicroplate (Mantovani &amp; Brito Neves 2009). Cryogenian \norogenic processes later truncated it, and it is covered \nlocally by metaconglomerate, metarkose, metagraywake \nand metavolcanics of the Cryogenian Abap\u00e3 Formation, \ndated at 628\u00b118 Ma. \n\nINTERCONTINENTAL INTEGRATION\n\nAs previously mentioned, a recent contribution, by \nBrito Neves and Fuck (2014) showed that the basement of \nthe South American Platform is divided into two distinct \nmajor geological and geotectonic domains, the Amazonian \nor pre-Brasiliano domain and the Brasiliano domain, which \nare separated by the transcontinental Transbrasiliano linea-\nment (Tab. 2). These domains are separated from each other \nby the Transcontinental Kandi-Transbrasiliano lineament. \nThe distinction between the two domains is underlined \n\nby the striking differences in stratigraphic organization in \nboth domains, especially when the tectonic events in the \nBrasiliano domain are considered. From the Mesoproterozoic \nonwards the two domains display very distinct geological \nfeatures and tectonic evolution. In Table 3, the different \ntectonic events comprising the Brasiliano collage are listed \nand detailed.\n\nTonian Terranes\nThe presence of Tonian terranes within the Brasiliano \n\ncollage is well documented. However, based on the available \ndata, it has been difficult to recognize them as representa-\ntive of an independent (post-Stenian, pre-Brasiliano) phase \nof crustal evolution. Although there is evidence of struc-\ntural discontinuity between the Tonian and the Brasiliano \nrock assemblages in some areas, the precise meaning of this \nbreak is hard to understand due to the strong overprint of \nBrasiliano orogenic events. \n\nAs far as geological knowledge and lithostructural con-\ntext of each province go, there is no evidence to link the \nTonian occurrences in Brazil to those of the classic Meso-\nNeoproterozoic Grenvillian orogenies of the northern and \nsouthern hemispheres. Also, there are fundamental differ-\nences in age and composition, and it has been truly diffi-\ncult to provide paleographic reconstruction, even following \nseveral different models.\n\nIn relation to Africa, based on previous reconstitutions \nand age data, the Meso-Neoproterozoic Namaqua\u2013Natal \nbelt is possibly the most interesting orogen (candidate) to \nbe correlated to South American Tonian terrains. Some \nsimilarities have been pointed out during the analysis \nof the literature. However, many difficulties are also evi-\ndent as, for instance, the lack of paleomagnetic support. \nMeso-Neoproterozoic geological units in Nigeria, Chad \nand southern Sudan, comparable with those in Brazil, \nhave been reported (de Wit et\u00a0al. 2005, 2008), but they \nhave been strongly reworked by the Pan-African orogeny. \nIf this supposed correlation will be confirmed, the Tonian \nterranes in West Gondwana may extend along strike for \nseveral thousands of kilometers. Actually, the presence \nof Tonian terranes in Rodinia, Western (and Eastern) \nGondwana has been neglected, and this is persisting as a \nchallenging open question.\n\nTonian processes and orogenies were absent and have \nnot been considered in the Rodinia concept; this supercon-\ntinent was formed at ca. 900 Ma ago (Li et\u00a0al. 2008). It is \nstill an open question whether the Tonian processes precede \n(or follow) Rodinia amalgamation, and this has important \nimplications for the configuration of this supercontinent. \nIt\u00a0appears that, in general, awareness of this problem is absent \nin the international scientific community.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n503\n\nBenjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.\n\n\n\nParan\u00e1\nBasin\n\nRJ\n\nIlha Grande\n\nParan\u00e1 Basin\n\nSB-  Serra da Bol\u00edvia\nRD-  Rio Doce (Galileia)\nRN-  Rio Negro\nAG-  Agudos  do Sul\nTC-  Tr\u00eas C\u00f3rregos\nCN-  Cunhaporanga\nGx-   Guaxup\u00e9\nSc-   S ocorro\n\nR-  Ribeira\nBr- Brasilia\nA-  Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed\n\nP-    Porteirinha\nCF- Cabo Frio\nE-    Emb\u00fa\nGU- Guanh\u00e3es\n\nCambrian (molassic) deposits\n\nNeoproterozoic magmatic arcs\n\nOphiolitic remnants  Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed belt\nNeoproterozoic belts\n(reworked basement \n  + supracrustals)\n\nReworked (Archean/)\npaleoproterozoic inliers\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Craton \n(basement + covers)\n\nTowns: SP- S\u00e3o Paulo, RJ- Rio de Janeiro, \nVI- Vit\u00f3ria, BH- Belo Horizonte, AR- Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed, \nGU- Guanh\u00e3es, DI- Diamantina\n\nFrom: Heilbron et al.

In other words, \nthese extensional processes are dominant and more easily \nobserved. In consequence, there are some obvious problems \nin recognizing the earliest orogenic events of the Brasiliano \ncollage, which will be here discussed.\n\nS\u00e3o Gabriel Arc\nThe best-documented examples of Early Cryogenian \n\naccretionary processes are from the S\u00e3o Gabriel arc, in west-\nern Rio Grande do Sul. The arc is partially hidden below \nEopaleozoic deposits (Maric\u00e1 Group, Camaqu\u00e3 basin) and \nby the Paran\u00e1 cratonic basin, underlying an area of ca. \n5,000 km2, limited by the NW-SE Ibar\u00e9 and NNE-SSW \nIrapu\u00e1 faults.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Gabriel arc comprises calc-alkaline granite-gneiss \n(Camba\u00ed Group, 890 \u2013 730 Ma), metavolcanic-sedimentary \nsequence (Vacaca\u00ed Group, 760 \u2013 730 Ma), ophiolite rem-\nnants (Cerro Mantiqueira, 740 Ma), and late 720 \u2013 685 Ma \nold intrusions (Laux et\u00a0al. 2010; Lena et\u00a0al. 2014).\n\nRecently, Philipp et\u00a0al. (2014) reported some older \nages in the southern part of the S\u00e3o Gabriel terrane. \nTonalite orthogneis from the Imbicu\u00ed rock unit was dated \nat 875\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma. Intrusive diorite was dated at 745\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 Ga. \nAccording to the authors, this may represent an older arc, \npossibly related with the Tonian terrains discussed above.\n\nCerro Bori orthogneisses\nEarly Cryogenian rocks are exposed in Cerro Bori, \n\nUruguay, east of the southernmost tip of the Pelotas-Aigu\u00e1 \nbatholith. Tonalite and granodiorite gneisses, mafic and fel-\nsic granulites and amphibolite are the dominant rock types \n(Lenz et\u00a0al. 2011). Petrological, geochemical and isotopic \ndata confirm magmatic arc affiliation. \n\nU-Pb SHRIMP data of mafic granulites indicate \nages between 770 and 796 Ma. Gneisses samples were \ndated\u00a0between 770 and 802 Ma. Regional metamorphism \nwas dated at ca. 676 Ma, implying in a complete accretion-\nary and collisional history before the emplacement of the \nPelotas\u2013Aigu\u00e1 batholith, preceding, therefore, all other accre-\ntionary processes related with the climax of the Brasiliano \norogeny. Lenz et\u00a0al. (2011) suggested an early Brasiliano \nevent (or Brasiliano I), following the earlier proposal by \nSilva et\u00a0al. (2005). Despite the small size of this area (ca. \n300 km2), this is an important occurrence that should be \nremarked. Relations with the almost coeval S\u00e3o Gabriel arc \nexposed to the west side of the Pelotas-Aigu\u00e1 batholith still \nhave to be investigated.\n\nThe \u201cEmbu terrane\u201d\nThe \u201cEmbu terrane\u201d is exposed in the central Mantiqueira \n\nProvince, to the northwest and north of the Curitiba terrane \n\nup to the northern part of the province (Figs. 4 and 5), strik-\ning NE-SW for more than 250 km and up to 40 km wide \n(Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2004; Campos Neto et\u00a0al. 2007; Alves et\u00a0al. \n2013; Trouw et\u00a0al. 2013). The Embu terrane is recognized \nas a continental fragment docked at the Ribeira belt during \nthe Ediacaran, when the Paranapanema and S\u00e3o Francisco \nplates collided. It comprises Paleoproterozoic gneiss (shown \nas a basement inlier in Figs. 4 and 5), medium- to high-\ngrade supracrustal rocks, as well as Cryogenian gneiss, and \ngranite intrusions dated at 600-590 Ma.\n\nEarly Cryogenian tonalite and granodiorite gneisses \nwith magmatic arc affinities exposed to the south of S\u00e3o \nPaulo were dated at 811 \u00b1 13 Ma (Cordani et\u00a0al. 2002) \nwhile muscovite leucogranites from the western \u201cEmbu ter-\nrane\u201d were dated at 760 \u2013 740 Ma (Passarelli et\u00a0al. 2004). \nXenotime and monazite from the Mogi das Cruzes granite \nyielded ages of ca. 790 Ma (Vlach 2001), similar to the age \nof regional metamorphism. \n\nOrogenic and anorogenic granite magmatism took place \nbetween 650 and 500 Ma, with the main peak between 590 \nand 540 Ma (Alves et\u00a0al. 2013). The available data suggest \nthat the \u201cEmbu\u201d is a Brasiliano terrane, although early \nCryogenian, as well as Meso- and Paleoproterozoic events \nhave also been identified (Alves et\u00a0al. 2013). However, con-\nnections with coeval events in neighboring terranes and belts \nhave yet to be investigated. There are some unpublished data \npointing out the occurrence of some pre-Proterozoic rock \nunits (at its northernmost part).\n\nThe Ceres-Rialma Metamorphic Belt\nA high-grade metamorphic belt is exposed along the \n\nheadwaters of the Tocantins River in central Brazil, east of \nthe Mara Rosa arc and Goi\u00e1s massif. It extends for more \nthan 350 km, striking NNE-SSW, and was formed in the \nEarly Cryogenian (Moraes &amp; Fuck 1994; Moraes et\u00a0al. 2004, \n2006, among others). \n\nThe western part of the belt comprises sedimentary and vol-\ncanic rocks of the Juscel\u00e2ndia, Indaian\u00f3polis and\u00a0Palmeir\u00f3polis \nsequences and the Serra da Malacacheta and Serra dos Borges \ngabbro-anorthosite complexes, formed in a rift environment \nthat evolved to ocean floor at ca. 1,270\u00a0Ma. These rocks \noverlie tectonically the eastern part of the belt that is made \nof the Barro Alto, Niquel\u00e2ndia and Cana Brava mafic-ultra-\nmafic layered complexes (Moraes et\u00a0al. 2004; Ferreira Filho \net\u00a0al. 2010, among others). It has been suggested that the \nlayered complexes are originally related to the taphrogenesis \nprocesses that led to the Rodinia breakup (Brito Neves &amp; \nFuck 2013), at about 800 Ma (Pimentel et\u00a0al. 2004; Della \nGiustina et\u00a0al. 2011).\n\nAlthough the original igneous stratigraphy and miner-\nalogy of the complexes were disturbed by late Eocryogenian \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n506\n\nThe Brasiliano collage in South America: a review \n\n\n\ntectonic-metamorphic processes (750 \u2013 770 Ma, Ferreira \nFilho 1994; Moraes et\u00a0al. 2006), it has been possible to \nretrieve petrological and geochemical data. These suggest \nthat they may have been a single large body, representing an \nEocryogenian LIP (Moraes et\u00a0al. 2004), an inference which \nappears to be supported by geophysical data (Soares 2005; \nSoares et\u00a0al. 2010). The two parts of the belts are singularly \ndifferent in origin and age, but were juxtaposed tectonically, \ndeformed and metamorphosed together under high-grade \nconditions of high-T amphibolite and granulite facies. They \nform an unusual high-grade belt between the Goi\u00e1s mas-\nsif and the Paleoproterozoic Natividade-Cavalcante block, \nbasement to the external zone of the Bras\u00edlia belt. Another \nnotable feature of the high-grade belt is that its metamorphic \ngradient is opposite to that of the Bras\u00edlia belt: it increases \nfrom west to east.\n\nDespite the numerous investigations carried out on \nthe belt, several questions are still pending. The age of \nclosure and inversion of the western Ectasian rift is still \ndebatable, although Moraes et\u00a0al. (2006) present prelim-\ninary data suggesting metamorphism between ca. 0.75 \u2013 \n0.76 Ga, as indicated by U-Pb analysis of metamorphic \nzircon and Sm-Nd garnet-whole rock isochrons on rocks \nof the Juscel\u00e2ndia sequence. The causes of orogeny and \nhigh-grade metamorphism are still poorly understood. \nSubsequent Neocryogenian tectonics and magmatism are \nrather complex, and hamper the understanding of previ-\nous events. It seems likely that the orogenic process may \nhave been caused by compressive far-field stresses resulting \nfrom the inversion of the large rift that led to the intru-\nsion of the layered mafic-ultramafic complexes. So far, no \nobvious connection could be established with the other \nCryogenian terrains discussed above.\n\nNeocryogenian-Early Ediacaran (650/600 \u2013 \n600/590\u00a0Ma)\u2014 \u201cPulse\u201d 2 of the Brasiliano collage\n\nThe Neocryogenian-Early Ediacaran time interval is \nmarked globally by post-Rodinia and pre-Gondwana events, \nand by diachronic accretionary and collisional processes \nin all of the Neoproterozoic structural provinces in South \nAmerica. Large orogenic chains with important crustal \naccretion events were then developed. They also include \nimportant recycling of Mesoproterozoic to Paleoarchean \ncrustal material. Narrow and wide oceans (Campos Neto \n2000; Schobbenhaus &amp; Brito Neves 2003; Basei et\u00a0al. 2008) \nwere consumed in a varied and complex scenario of plate \ninteraction and continent formation. Collisional processes \nwere followed soon after (late Cryogenian-early Ediacaran)\nby the intrusion of typically collisional syenite and granite \nbodies emplaced in thickened crust. In other cases \u2014 e.g., \n\nSE of Brasilia belt, north of Mantiqueira province \u2014, the \ncollision was entirely confined within the early Ediacaran.\n\nTocantins Province\nIn the Tocantins Province (Figs. 2 and 3), the Brasiliano \n\npart of the Goi\u00e1s magmatic arc (Pimentel et\u00a0al. 2000, 2004; \nFuck et\u00a0al. 2006; Oliveira et\u00a0al. 2006; Dantas et\u00a0al. 2006) \nand of the Socorro-Guaxup\u00e9 nappe, further south (Campos \nNeto &amp; Caby 2000), are relatively well studied, with refer-\nence to interacting plates, closed ocean realms, as well as to \ntheir accretion history (650 \u2013 630 Ma) and subsequent col-\nlision (ca. 625 Ma). Metamorphic processes and post-colli-\nsional events are relatively well constrained.\n\nThe Araguaia (Rokelide) orogenic system further north \nwithin the Tocantins Province displays good geological and \ngeochronological records of ocean closure (770 \u2013 550 Ma), as \nattested by the Quatipuru, Serra do Tapa and Tucuru\u00ed ophio-\nlites (Paix\u00e3o et\u00a0al. 2008). So far, there is no clear evidence of \nrelated arc magmatism. However, based on positive gravity \nBouguer anomalies observed in the basement, it has been \nsuggested that the Goi\u00e1s magmatic arc might branch out \nnorthwards below the Parna\u00edba basin (Castro et\u00a0al. 2014).\n\nBorborema Province\nAn important accretionary event has been recorded in the \n\nwestern Borborema Province (Fig. 1). The Santa Quit\u00e9ria-\nTamboril system is ca. 380-km-long, striking north-south, \nand up to 110-km-wide (Fetter et\u00a0al. 2003; Santos et\u00a0al. 2008, \n2009; Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. 2012; Costa et\u00a0al. 2013; Vasconcellos \net\u00a0al. 2013). Several aspects of arc formation and evolution \nare still unknown, due to the lack of data and to the super-\nimposed extrusion tectonics. Recent magnetotelluric data \ndisplay evidence of double convergent subduction below \nthe Santa Quit\u00e9ria arc (Padilha et\u00a0al. 2014), corroborated by \nremnants of eclogite/retroeclogite and high-pressure gran-\nulite on both sides of the arc (Santos et\u00a0al. 2009; Amaral \net\u00a0al. 2011, 2012).\n\nIn the \u201cZona Transversal\u201d of the Borborema Province, \nand in several other areas, there are references of granites \nformed in magmatic arcs (e.g. \u201cConcei\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, \u201cBrejinho\u201d, \n\u201cRiacho do Ic\u00f3\u201d, \u201cTimba\u00faba\u201d, \u201cCaboclo-Nova Olinda\u201d, \n\u201cCurral de Cima\u201d, etc. (Brito Neves et\u00a0al. 2003; Ferreira \net\u00a0al. 2004; Sial et\u00a0al. 2008), the majority of which were \ndated between 650 and 620 Ma.\n\n These granites of the \u201cZona Transversal\u201d domain (cen-\ntral-western part) are mostly piercing rock assemblages of \nthe Pianc\u00f3-Alto Br\u00edgida (SPAB), Riacho Gravat\u00e1 (RG) and \nAlto Paje\u00fa terranes (AP) (See Fig. 1). This group of granites \ndeserves further investigation, and, informally, they have \nbeen grouped as part of the \u201cAlto Sert\u00e3o Magmatic Arc\u201d.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n507\n\nBenjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.\n\n\n\n Accretionary orogenic evolution has also been proposed \nfor the northern part of the Sergipano belt, on the south-\nern border of the Pernambuco-Alagoas massif (Oliveira \net\u00a0al. 2010), where ages are well constrained between 630 \nand 617 Ma.\n\nIn the African Dahomeyan-Trans-Saharan counterpart \nof the Borborema Province, Caby (2011) reports that the \nmain calk-alkaline plutonic phase of active continental mar-\ngin took place at 640 \u2013 630 Ma, followed by regional meta-\nmorphism at 620 \u2013 600 Ma.\n\nMantiqueira Province\nAccretionary processes have also been recognized in the \n\nMantiqueira Province, from eastern Minas Gerais to east-\nern Uruguay (Figs. 4 and 5), forming different branches for \nmore than 1,500 km along the eastern margin of the con-\ntinent, between 18\u00baS and 34\u00baS (Cordani et\u00a0al. 2000; Bizzi \net\u00a0al. 2003; Mantesso Neto et\u00a0al. 2004; Silva et\u00a0al. 2005, \namong others). The accretionary systems are not continu-\nous along the strike of the province, but are supported by \na wealth of geological, geochemical and geochronological \ndata. These include:\n\n ? Rio Doce, in Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Rio \nde Janeiro (Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2004; Pedrosa Soares et\u00a0al. \n2006, 2014), possibly extending to the coastal Serra \nMar in S\u00e3o Paulo (Campos Neto 2000): 630 \u2013 590 Ma \n&lt;580\u00a0\u2013\u00a0570\u00a0Ma (main accretionary phases). \n\n ?

Rio Negro, in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo (Tupinamb\u00e1 \net\u00a0 al. 2007, 2010; Heilbron et\u00a0 al. 2004): 792 Ma, \n650\u00a0\u2013\u00a0630\u00a0Ma.\n\n ? Cunhaporanga, Tr\u00eas C\u00f3rregos and Agudos Grandes, in \nS\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 (Prazeres Filho et\u00a0al. 2003; Siga \nJr. et\u00a0al. 2011): 630 \u2013 610 Ma.\n\n ? Pien, in Paran\u00e1 (Basei et\u00a0al. 2008): 615 Ma.\n ? Florian\u00f3polis, Pelotas-Aigu\u00e1, in Santa Catarina, Rio \n\nGrande do Sul and Uruguay, respectively (Silva et\u00a0al. \n2005; Basei et\u00a0al. 2008): 635 \u2013 590 Ma.\n\nThe scheme of plate interactions is not fully understood. \nIn the northern part of the Mantiqueira Province, the western \n\u201cS\u00e3o Francisco plate\u201d represents the lower plate. The upper \nplate to the east was possibly the \u201cCongo plate\u201d, but this \nis still an open question (also, there are some objections). \nOther authors envisage collision in a broader scenario, such \nas the \u201cnutcracker model\u201d proposed by Alkmim et\u00a0al. (2006).\n\nIn the central part of the province, several lithospheric \nfragments have been mentioned as interacting plates/micro-\nplates/microcontinents; these include the Paranapanema, \nCuritiba, and Luis Alves blocks (Figs. 4 and 5). However, \n\nthe proposed models need additional tectonic and geophys-\nical support in order to be validated (Basei et\u00a0al. 2008). \nThe\u00a0model developed for the southern part of the province \nsuggests that the \u201cRio de La Plata\u201d represents the lower plate \n(to the west) and the Kalahari (to the east), would be the \nupper plate (Basei et\u00a0al. 2008). Many of the difficulties in \nidentifying the plates involved are related to the\u00a0post-col-\nlisional shear systems resulting from Neoediacaran-early \nOrdovician escape tectonic processes, which hamper paleo-\ngeographic reconstructions. Additionally, evolution of the \nSouth Atlantic continental margin and the Cenozoic uplift \nand other brittle tectonic events also mask some of the (for-\nmer) Brasiliano features.\n\nSome local and precursor events of the \nNeocryogenian-early Ediacaran processes and/or \ninheritance \u2014 Preceding \u201cpulse\u201d 2\n\nIn some cases, initial accretionary events have been dis-\ncriminated from the dominant Neocryogenian ones, due to \nreliable isotopic data, although the lack of appropriate field \ndata may hamper their interpretation.\n\nIn the Santa Quit\u00e9ria magmatic arc, W Cear\u00e1 (Borborema \nProvince), the large majority of age determinations are in the \n640-610 Ma interval. However, in the eastern part of the \narc, granodiorite, metatexite and diatexite have crystalliza-\ntion ages between 876 and 831 Ma (Araujo et\u00a0al. 2012), this \nmeans ca. 200 Ma older than the main phase of arc building.\n\nIn the Rio Negro arc, Rio de Janeiro (Mantiqueira \nProvince), the main rock assemblages were formed mainly \nbetween 630 and 590 Ma. A granodiorite gneiss sample was \nrecently dated at 792 \u00b1 12 Ma and a granite sample at ca. \n845 Ma, interpreted as the product of initial arc magma-\ntism (Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2004). Although additional isotopic \ndata are needed, the new ages are duly noted.\n\nEarly \u2013 Middle Ediacaran (590 \u2013 560 Ma) \u2014 \n\u201cPulse\u201d 3 of the Brasiliano collage\n\nSeveral tectonic events took place during the 590\u00a0\u2013\u00a0560\u00a0Ma \ntime interval, including accretionary orogenic processes.\n\nAs mentioned previously, rocks representing \u201cpulse\u201d 3, \naside from those of the so-called \u201cRio Doce arc\u201d in Minas \nGerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, according to Campos Neto and \nFigueiredo (1995) and Campos Neto (2000), are exposed \nin the coastal zone of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, along \nthe Serra do Mar (\u201cSerra do Mar terrane\u201d, Campos Neto \n2000). According to this peculiar concept of the \u201cRio \nDoce arc\u201d (590 \u2013 570 Ma), its rock forming events overlap \nthose of the preceding orogenic pulse represented by the \nRio Negro arc, exposed eastwards. According to Campos \nNeto and Figueiredo (1995) and Campos Neto (2000), \nthese events have (some type of ) connection with those of \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n508\n\nThe Brasiliano collage in South America: a review \n\n\n\nthe Rio Doce orogeny in the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed belt, further north \nin the Mantiqueira Province. So, a precise separation of \nthe orogenic \u201cpulses\u201d (arc magmatism) 2 and 3 along the \ncoastal zone of the Mantiqueira Province is still uncertain \n(Heilbron et\u00a0al. 2013).\n\nIn the Borborema Province, granite magmatism, includ-\ning high-K, peralkaline, ultrapotassic, and rarely shoshonitic \nmagmatism, took place mainly in the time interval between \n590 and 570 Ma (Ferreira et\u00a0al. 2004; Sial et\u00a0al. 2008). These \nmagmatic events followed the emplacement of epidote-bear-\ning tonalite and granodiorite (of the \u201cpulse 2\u201d), these prob-\nably related with arc magmatism (\u201cAlto Sert\u00e3o Magmatic \nArc\u201d), between ca. 650 and 620 Ma.\n\nIn addition to the successive accretionary events, there \nare several indications of intraplate orogenic processes with-\nout any evidence of previous subduction. Collisional/met-\namorphic events (ca. 590 \u2013 560 Ma) have been recorded in \nsome particular cases of the Brasiliano structural provinces \n(e.g. part of the northern Mantiqueira Province, to the north \nof the Patos lineament in the Borborema province, etc.). \n\nThe identification of truly orogenic events occurring \nduring the Early-Middle Ediacaran has been difficult, due \nto concurrent post-orogenic tectonic and magmatic events, \nas well as anorogenic magmatism, which overlap in time and \nspace with the orogenic rocks.\n\nAccording to Tupinamb\u00e1 et\u00a0 al. (2007, 2010), the \naccretionary phase of the Rio Negro arc ended around \n600 Ma ago, and the collisional phase started soon after, \nincluding several syn-collisional magmatic events until \n560 Ma. These authors admitted also that another mag-\nmatic arc may have been accreted at the beginning of the \ncollisional phase, reiterating previous observations by \nCampos Neto (2000).\n\n Post-collision processes have been recorded in many \nplaces, such as granite and syenite magmatism (e.g. Itu and \nGraciosa suites, Teixeira-Terra Nova tectonic zone, late \ngranites of the Rio Doce and Rio Negro arcs, Araguaia and \nBrasilia belts granites, granite magmatism piercing through \nbasement inliers in the Borborema Province, etc.). Given the \nwidespread occurrence of processes and their record, this is \nclearly a time interval composed of a diversified plethora of \ntectonic and magmatic activities. The distinction between \nthe events of this time interval, late and post-collisional pro-\ncesses, from the previous ones, arc magmatism and meta-\nmorphism, still needs to be completed with new and better \ngeological field data and isotopic information. It is also use-\nful to bear in mind that escape- (extrusional) tectonic pro-\ncesses and foreland tectonics affecting the South American \nPlatform as a whole (in fact a large part of West Gondwana) \nstarted soon after 580 Ma. These processes obliterated some \nof the original geological relationships.\n\nCambrian Orogenies (530 \u2013 490 Ma) \u2014 \u201cPulse\u201d \n4 of the Brasiliano collage \n\nFrom the late Ediacaran to the early Ordovician, the \nmost remarkable tectonic events in South America are \nrelated to post-collisional processes, marking the transition \nfrom unstable to stable tectonic conditions. They mainly \ninclude escape tectonics and associated sedimentary pro-\ncesses, foreland tectonics, extension-related intrusions and \nisostatic adjustments.\n\nWhile such processes were underway, two local minor \norogenic developments were in process in the eastern and \nsouthwestern parts (B\u00fazios and Pampean orogenies, respec-\ntively) of the continental area that soon after became Western \nGondwana.\n\nB\u00fazios orogeny\nThe Cambrian B\u00fazios orogeny, the youngest event of \n\nthe Ribeira belt in the Mantiqueira Province, is recognized \nin the coastal zone of Rio de Janeiro (Regi\u00e3o dos Lagos, \nSchmitt et\u00a0al. 2008; Schmitt &amp; Armstrong 2014).\n\nThe tectonic evolution started with the history of a small \n(residual?) ocean basin from 610 Ma onwards, where volca-\nnic-sedimentary sequences accumulated. These rocks were \ndeformed and metamorphosed under high-grade conditions, \nand transported to the northwest at ca. 520 Ma. The\u00a0hypoth-\nesis is a process of subduction of the \u201cAngola plate\u201d (to the \neast) under the \u201cTerreno Oriental\u201d (to the west). This is esti-\nmated to have taken place between 590 and 530 Ma, which \nwas followed by collision at ca. 530 \u2013 520 Ma. Late igneous \nand tectonic activity took place between 520 and 490 Ma \n(Schmitt et\u00a0al. 2008). The authors compare this complete \nWilson cycle with the products of Pan-African orogeny in the \nKaoko belt in Angola and Namibia. Schmitt and Armstrong \n(2014) admit that the orogeny extended until ca. 490 Ma \nin a stepwise process that progressed to a poorly understood \nOrdovician orogenic collapse, until middle Ordovician times.\n\nPampean orogeny\nThe Pampean orogenic belt, east of Cordoba, Argentina \n\n(Fig. 6), developed in response to the subduction of the \nlower \u201cPampia microplate\u201d to the west, made of high-grade \n\u201cGrenvillian\u201d rocks, under the Rio de La Plata upper plate in \nthe east (Rapela et\u00a0al. 1998; Escayola et\u00a0al. 2007; Schwartz \net\u00a0al. 2008). The orogen comprises two parallel belts, the east-\nern one comprising mostly calc-alkaline magmatic rocks, and \nthe western made of metasedimentary rocks and peralumi-\nnous granites. Calc-alkaline magmatism was active between \n555 and 525 Ma, whereas peraluminous intrusions associ-\nated with regional metamorphism took place in the Early \nCambrian (525 \u2013 515Ma). Ophiolite remnants were dated \nby the Sm-Nd method at 647 \u00b1 70 Ma (Escayola et\u00a0al. 2007).\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n509\n\nBenjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.\n\n\n\nSchwartz et\u00a0al. (2008) proposed a possible connection with \nthe \u201cTerra Australis orogen\u201d, along the closing paleo-Pacific \nOcean. In a regional perspective, there is the possibility of a \nnorthward connection with the Paraguay belt (south-western \nborder of the Amazonian plate), although there is no evidence \nfor subduction of ocean lithosphere in the latter. Additional \ngeological and geophysical data are necessary to test this model.\n\nPRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS \nABOUT GONDWANA AMALGAMATION\n\nProcesses leading to amalgamation of supercontinental \nmasses are complex, long lasting, and accomplished according \n\nto amalgamation fronts of distinct paleogeography. Eventually, \namalgamation processes in one province or front concur in \ntime with taphrogenesis or breakup processes taking place \nin other areas. These are fundamentally diachronic processes \nfrom one amalgamation front to another and from one prov-\nince to another. Therefore, understanding supercontinent \nformation requires a large amount of geological, tectonic, \npaleomagnetic and isotopic data. Additionally, it should be \nremembered that supercontinents are not the final product \nof configuration, therefore improvement of tectonic mod-\nels are necessary.\n\nSeveral distinct models for the assembly and evolution \nof Gondwana have been proposed, but the problem is far \nfrom resolved.

Should this be the \ncase, two of these fronts are represented in the South \nAmerica basement, in addition to Mediterranean-Middle \nEast-Arabia, East Africa-Madagascar-India-Sri Lanka-\nAntarctica, with ramifications to Zambezi and Damara, \nand Rokelides-Araguaia-Paraguay-Pampean. \n\nThere are other models/versions of Gondwana forma-\ntion, e.g. Stern (1994), Meert (2003) (Kuunga and East \nAfrica orogenies); Zulauf et\u00a0al. (2004) (Cadomian orogeny), \nMeet and Lieberman (2008), Linnemann et\u00a0al. (2008, 2014) \n(North Africa, Cadomian orogeny), etc. See discussions in \nthe next item of this paper. Consensus seems to be hard to \nachieve, and it will certainly take time to better understand \namalgamation of Gondwana.\n\nIndependent of academic dissent, and aware of the need \nfor new data, it can be stated that the Brasiliano collage in \nSouth America (and in part of westernmost Africa) com-\nprises four distinct phases (main \u201cpulses\u201d), from the early \nCryogenian (Neoproterozoic) to the early Ordovician (in \nsome special cases, up to the upper Ordovician, ca.\u00a0440\u00a0Ma). \nThe latest processes of collage fronts that ended up in Western \nGondwana amalgamation are recorded in South America, \nand some similar and coeval events have been recorded in \nwesternmost Africa (e.g. Schmitt et\u00a0al. 2008; Schmitt &amp; \nArmstrong 2014).\n\nFrom Bahia to Uruguay, the Mantiqueira Province dis-\nplays the most complete record of the main tectonic-mag-\nmatic events referred to above, including the Tonian ter-\nranes and the four Neoproterozoic pulses. None of the \nother provinces present such a complete record. However, \nas mentioned previously, there are some unsolved ques-\ntions related to the adequate and precise discrimination of \nthe pulses discussed above (pre-740 Ma; 650 \u2013 630 Ma; \n590 \u2013\u00a0560\u00a0Ma; 530\u00a0\u2013\u00a0490\u00a0Ma). Also, it will be necessary \nto refine time interval limits, as well as to search for addi-\ntional magmatic and metamorphic records. It should be \nnoted that in the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed belt, northern portion of the \nMantiqueira Province, late-collisional granites were intruded \nfrom 590 to 530 Ma. Similar intrusions were reported from \nthe Borborema Province and other areas. However, robust \nisotopic data are lacking.\n\nWhere and when did Gondwana finally \namalgamate?\n\nIn general, the orogenic processes that led to Gondwana \namalgamation (Collins et\u00a0al. 2011) are somewhat similar and \ncoeval ( ~ 750Ma \u00b1 ?x \u2013 500 Ma \u00b1 ?x), in its western as well \n\nas in its eastern portion. Early phases, nevertheless, display \nsome important time differences. On the other hand, late- \nto post-orogenic events tend to overlap in the late Ediacaran, \nor in the middle Cambrian, occasionally extending into the \nOrdovician. This most important set of geotectonic processes \ncoincides with one of the most dynamic periods of Earth \nevolution, involving all its geospheres and their compo-\nnents. The overall time lapse comprised in this long, com-\nplex and polyphase assembly process (ca. 280\u00a0\u2013\u00a0250 Ma) \nis comparable to that of the assembly of Pangea, between \n500 and 230 Ma ago (270 Ma), for which scientific foun-\ndation (Stratigraphy, Paleontology, Paleomagnetism) is \nmuch more reliable.\n\nSimilarities notwithstanding, detailed analysis of each \nportion of the continent shows that the orogenic collage \npulses are quite distinct in time and importance. It should \nbe noted that the polyphase development of Gondwana \n(Tab.\u00a04) bears many similarities with the formation of \nPangaea, where several phases (e.g. Caledonian, Alleghenian, \netc.), are constantly highlighted. However it is well known \nthat they are not exclusive.\n\nNorthern part of Gondwana\nIn northern Gondwana, three main orogenic phases have \n\nbeen distinguished (Linnemann et\u00a0al. 2008, 2014; Pereira \net\u00a0al. 2012, among others), the last, related to the evolution \nof the Rheic ocean, and the initial development of Pangaea:\n\n ? Mid-Ediacaran, > 590 \u2013 570 Ma, magmatic arc stage \n(Avalonian) and formation of backarc basins;\n\n ? Late-Ediacaran, 570/560 \u2013 545/543 Ma, oblique collision \nbetween the Cadomian arc and the hinterland, closing \nthe Cadomian backarc basin and other related basins;\n\n ? Cambrian-early Ordovician, 540 ? 500/485 Ma. There \nis no abrupt break between the Cadomian orogeny and \nCambro-Ordovician rifts, which led to the Rheic ocean \nopening. After collision, slab break-off is thought to \nhave taken place from 540 Ma onwards, overlapping \nrifting\u00a0and new ocean opening. U-Pb age data between \n522 and 499 Ma of the sedimentary deposits (Serra \nNegra succession, Pereira et\u00a0al. 2012) indicate that they \nare part of a new post-discontinuity cycle above the Early \nCambrian unconformity of 542 Ma.\n\nEastern Gondwana\nSeveral distinct, although not necessarily opposite, \n\ndigressions apply to eastern Gondwana evolution, from \nthe Arabian\u2013Nubian shield, to India, western Australia \nand Antarctica.\n\na) Collins and Pisarevsky (2005) provided an excellent \nsynthesis based on rich paleogeographic documentation \nand paleomagnetic data of the whole evolutionary process, \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 44(3): 493-518, September 2014\n511\n\nBenjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.\n\n\n\nstarting at 750 Ma. The authors display the continental masses \ninvolved, as well as the intervening oceans (Mozambique, \n\u201cAdola\u201d, Adamastor, \u201cBraziliano\u201d, \u201cPacific\u201d). Three orogenic \nphases of the collage are recognized:\n\n ? The first orogenic phase (c. 630 Ma) is recorded between \neast Africa (\u201cAzania\u201d) and the \u201cCongo/Tanzania/\nBangweulu\u201d (\u201cCTB\u201d) masses, and between these and the \ncontinental masses of the \u201cSaharan metacraton\u201d, includ-\ning closure of several minor ocean basins between them;\n\n ? Early Ediacaran (ca. 570 Ma), when \u201cCTB\u201d collided \nwith the S\u00e3o Franciscano block. There is no record of \nthis collision in South America, or of its continuity into \nthe collision with \u201cAz\u00e2nia\u201d;\n\n ? Early Cambrian (540 \u2013 530 Ma), encompassing a \nseries of collision processes east and west of India with \n\u201cAustr\u00e1lia\u2013Mawson\u201d, and \u201cAz\u00e2nia\u201d, and of \u201cCTB\u201d with \nKalahari (including northern Mantiqueira Province?) and \nRio de La Plata (Don Feliciano belt?). Associated with \nthese processes, high-grade metamorphism took place \nin several of the resulting mobile belts.\n\nb) Based on geochronological and other databases, \nMeert (2003) and Meert and Lieberman (2008) present \ndifferent concepts and syntheses, displaying several notice-\nable and well-documented phases for the 750 \u2013 530 Ma \ntime interval:\n\nEast African orogeny:\n ? ca. 750 Ma (between 780 and 720 Ma): important \n\naccretion phase, arc magmatism from northern Africa \n(Arabia-Nubian shield) to Antarctica.\n\n ? ca. 640 Ma (between 700 and 610 Ma): important \nphase of collisions, high-grade metamorphism, and in \nsome cases initiation of escape tectonics (Arabia-Nubian \nshield, Somalia, Eritrea).\n\n ? ca. 550/540 Ma (between 590-520 Ma) \u2014 Kuunga \norogeny \u2014: collision, high-grade metamorphism and \npost-orogenic magmatism in several belts. Structures \nrelated to the Kuunga orogeny strike orthogonally to \nthose of the East African orogen, between the south-\nwest coast of Africa (Damara), southern India and west-\nern Australia.\n\nMeert (2003) has suggested that the 500 Ma old Ross-\nDelamerian belt (Australia-Antarctica-South Africa) should \nbe ascribed to a later event that took place after final sutur-\ning of Gondwana, adding to the controversy about the belt. \nThis suggestion is a matter of dispute.\n\nWest Gondwana\nAs discussed above, and previously highlighted by Brito \n\nNeves and Fuck (2013), four main orogenic pulses are recorded \n\nTable 4.

Further con-\nsiderations on the final orogenic processes (Pampean and \nB\u00fazios) are presented below.\n\nBuzios Orogeny\nIn the central-northern portion of the Mantiqueira \n\nProvince, another Cambrian orogen is recognized, as dis-\ncussed above. The orogenic belt appears to correspond to \nthe closing of a small oceanic basin or back-arc, which \nremained between the \u201cTerreno Oriental\u201d, the upper plate \nof the Ribeira orogenic belt, and a colliding continental frac-\ntion (Cabo Frio terrane), in the east, interpreted by some \nauthors as a slice from the Congo craton/plate. \n\nThe collisional process probably closed a remnant \nfraction of the Adamastor Ocean, and led to intense \nlow-angle deformation and high-T amphibolite to granu-\nlite facies metamorphism. Geological and geochronolog-\nical studies (Schmitt et\u00a0al. 2008; Schmitt &amp; Armstrong \n2014) identified Cambrian ages of 530 \u2013 510 Ma for the \norogeny, which was followed by collapse and extrusion \nbetween 510 and 480 Ma. Geological and geochrono-\nlogical equivalents were found in western Africa, within \nthe Kaoko belt (Schmitt et\u00a0al. 2008). Recently, Schmitt \nand Armstrong (2014) presented new data, reiterating the \nMiddle to Late Cambrian age of 515 \u2013 510 Ma, possibly \nextending up to 490 Ma, for the B\u00fazios orogeny. Still \nnot well-understood collapse processes occurred until the \nMid Ordovician (c. 440 Ma). \n\nPampean\nEscayola et\u00a0al. (2007) reported the Sm-Nd isochron age \n\n647 \u00b1 77 Ma for ophiolite remnants and interpreted it as \nthe best age estimate for the development of oceanic lith-\nosphere in the belt. Early Cambrian ages of 530 \u2013 514 Ma \nwere recorded for the calk-alkaline arc magmatism and sub-\nsequent metamorphism (collision).\n\nSchwartz et\u00a0al. (2008) concluded that subduction started at \n555 Ma, in the Ediacaran, establishing ages of 555 \u2013 525\u00a0Ma for \nthe arc magmatism, partially overlapping with the data of Escayola \net\u00a0al. (2007). They pointed out 525 Ma as the age of collision \nand metamorphism, revealing the record of Early Cambrian \namalgamation of Gondwana in southwest South America.\n\nRecent data (Rapela et\u00a0al. 2014) added new informa-\ntion to the age of the Pampean orogeny. Metasedimentary \nrocks affected by the orogeny include a 525 Ma old detri-\ntal zircon peak among Neo- and Mesoproterozoic and older \nzircon grains. Therefore, ages younger than 525 Ma should \nbe expected for the orogeny, allowing the possibility of ages \nfrom the Middle to Late Cambrian (&lt;530 Ma).\n\nIt is also possible that these orogenic processes reached \nfarther north, encompassing the southern branch of the \nParaguay belt (MacGee et\u00a0al. 2012). This proposition has \nbeen challenged by Cordani et\u00a0al. (2013a).\n\nAlthough remote, there is the possibility of a connection \nbetween the Pampean and the Ross-Delamerian orogens \n(positioned to the south of Gondwana, south of Antartica \nand Australia). Lack of data hampers discussion at this time.\n\nAccioly C.A., Santos C.A., Santos E.J., Brito Neves B.B., Rodrigues \nJ.B., McReath I. 2010.
