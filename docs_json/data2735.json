However, this \n\nrecommendation may not be general due to the lack of studies that test this hypothesis \n\nin the Mediterranean area, where landscapes are very different from those of central-\n\nnorth Europe. Nowadays, the European wildcat is distributed in Europe in a number of \n\nfragmented populations threatened by destruction of their natural habitats, persecution \n\nand crossbreeding with free-ranging domestic feral cats. The conservation of wildcat in \n\nthe constantly changing, human-altered landscapes of Southern Iberia requires therefore \n\na clear understanding of the species limits and capabilities in these environments. My \n\nthesis focused on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by human-\n\nrelated activities. In natural areas the wildcat constrains are link to human actions and \n\nactivities. First step was to build a model that incorporates the advantages of correlative \n\nand mechanistic models to develop large-scale determinants that express the local \n\nindividual requirements for wide range wildcat distribution. The results obtained \n\nsuggest the importance of small mammals as prey for the species, as well the negative \n\ninfluence of human disturbance. Human disturbance is reflected in changes in the land \n\nuse, direct persecution and the expansion and dimension of domestic cat populations. \n\nThe presence of domestic species in natural areas often represent a conservation \n\nproblem due to competition with and predation of wild species, because they act as \n\nreservoirs for many diseases and even due to the potential hybridization with the wild \n\nancestor types. The impact of domestic cats depends on where they can be found and on \n\nthe factors controlling their numbers and space use. In this Thesis were described the \n\npatterns of presence, abundance, spatial behaviour and human constraints (food \n\nresources) associated to domestic cats. Human activities and domestic cat population \n\nstructure, that implies different scenarios for wildcat conservation, were discussed in the \n\nlast Chapter of this Thesis.  \n\nKey-words: domestic cat Felis catus, European wildcat Felis silvestris, People and cats \n\ndistribution, wildcat conservation \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n xv \n\nResumo \n\n_____________________________________________________ \n\nNas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas verificou-se uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o crescente com as quest\u00f5es \n\nambientais globais, resultantes da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do meio ambiente, como consequ\u00eancia da \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pr\u00e1ticas n\u00e3o sustent\u00e1veis no uso dos recursos naturais, levando \u00e0 perda \n\nacelerada da diversidade biol\u00f3gica. Cerca de 44% de todas as esp\u00e9cies de plantas \n\nvasculares e 35% de todas as esp\u00e9cies de quatro grupos de vertebrados (anf\u00edbios, \n\nr\u00e9pteis, aves e mam\u00edferos), est\u00e3o confinadas a 25 \u201chotspots\u201d de biodiversidade que \n\nocupam apenas 1,4% de toda a superf\u00edcie da Terra. Entre estes \u201chotspots\u201d est\u00e1 a bacia \n\nMediterr\u00e2nica, sendo parte significativa dessa \u00e1rea a metade sul da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. \n\nNo Mediterr\u00e2neo, ocorrem 38 esp\u00e9cies de mam\u00edferos, alguns end\u00e9micos com destaque \n\npara o lince Ib\u00e9rico Lynx pardinus, o felino mais amea\u00e7ado do Mundo. Localizada na \n\nparte mais ocidental do Mediterr\u00e2neo, a Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica caracteriza-se por ter esta\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndo ano bem marcadas, com ver\u00f5es quentes e secos, e invernos amenos e chuvosos. Em \n\ntermos gerais, apresenta dois grandes planaltos no centro, dominados por agricultura \n\nextensiva de cereais, intercalados por manchas de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o escler\u00f3fita, constitu\u00eddos na \n\nsua maioria por sistemas agro-florestais. No Norte e Noroeste da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, as \n\nflorestas folhosas e mistas s\u00e3o a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o dominante, intercaladas por parcelas de \n\npastagens, dando origem a uma diversificada comunidade de predadores e presas. O \n\ngradual desaparecimento da floresta original, substitu\u00edda pelo aumento da \u00e1rea ocupada \n\npor matos e matagais, em combina\u00e7\u00e3o com a diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o da paisagem ao longo do \n\ntempo, afectou n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies, mas tamb\u00e9m a sua diversidade \n\ngen\u00e9tica. Durante a segunda metade do s\u00e9culo XX, as \u00e1reas rurais da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica \n\nsofreram uma emigra\u00e7\u00e3o em massa para as cidades, com o abandono dos tradicionais \n\nusos agr\u00edcolas. A causa desse abandono foi a intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da agricultura em \u00e1reas \n\nplanas, devido ao aumento da produtividade causada pela mecaniza\u00e7\u00e3o, uso de \n\nfertilizantes qu\u00edmicos e novos mecanismos de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o. Estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es levaram \u00e0 \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e efectivo populacional de numerosas esp\u00e9cies, algumas \n\ndas quais se encontram actualmente distribu\u00eddas por popula\u00e7\u00f5es fragmentadas e de \n\npequena dimens\u00e3o. Com uma ampla distribui\u00e7\u00e3o no passado o gato bravo Europeu Felis \n\nsilvestris distribu\u00eda-se por todas as regi\u00f5es florestadas da Europa, do C\u00e1ucaso e da \u00c1sia. \n\nActualmente ocorre em popula\u00e7\u00f5es fragmentadas de Portugal, Espanha, Fran\u00e7a, It\u00e1lia e \n\nAlemanha, Balc\u00e3s, C\u00e1rpagos, C\u00e1ucaso e \u00c1sia, al\u00e9m de algumas popula\u00e7\u00f5es insulares, na  \n\n\n\n xvi \n\nEsc\u00f3cia e Sic\u00edlia. Por causa do decl\u00ednio em v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas da sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o na Europa, o \n\ngato bravo encontra-se limitado \u00e0s zonas montanhosas de baixa e m\u00e9dia altitude, com \n\npouca perturba\u00e7\u00e3o humana, onde se encontra associado a ambientes florestais (zona \n\nAtl\u00e2ntica) ou com coberto arbustivo (zona Mediterr\u00e2nea). Nas zonas Mediterr\u00e2neas da \n\nPen\u00ednsula, as \u00e1reas de mosaico constitu\u00eddas por um misto de pastagens intercaladas com \n\nmanchas de matos, para al\u00e9m da grande disponibilidade de presas (especialmente coelho \n\nbravo Oryctolagus cuniculus) tamb\u00e9m proporcionam abrigo e ref\u00fagio. Apesar dos \n\nmicromam\u00edferos serem a base da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do gato bravo na maioria da sua \u00e1rea de \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o, em ambientes mediterr\u00e2neos s\u00e3o substitu\u00eddos como presa-base pelo coelho \n\nbravo. De entre os factores de amea\u00e7a, para al\u00e9m daqueles que s\u00e3o comuns a outras \n\nesp\u00e9cies de carn\u00edvoros, como a perda de habitat, diminui\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es presa, e \n\npersegui\u00e7\u00e3o humana atrav\u00e9s do controlo de predadores associado \u00e0 actividade \n\ncineg\u00e9tica, acresce aqueles que t\u00eam que ver com a expans\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de gato \n\ndom\u00e9stico Felis catus em \u00e1reas naturais. De facto, a hibrida\u00e7\u00e3o introgressiva com o gato \n\ndom\u00e9stico \u00e9 referida como a mais grave amea\u00e7a \u00e0 conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do gato bravo. No \n\nentanto, e ao contr\u00e1rio de outras regi\u00f5es da Europa, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de gato bravo na \n\nPen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica apresenta baixos n\u00edveis de hibrida\u00e7\u00e3o, conferindo-lhes um alto valor \n\nde conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. A presen\u00e7a de gatos dom\u00e9sticos em \u00e1reas naturais muitas vezes \n\nrepresenta um problema de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, tamb\u00e9m, devido \u00e0 competi\u00e7\u00e3o e preda\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nesp\u00e9cies selvagens, para al\u00e9m das suas popula\u00e7\u00f5es funcionarem como reservat\u00f3rios para \n\nmuitas doen\u00e7as. Sabendo que o sucesso do gato dom\u00e9stico em colonizar novas \u00e1reas \n\nest\u00e1 associado \u00e0 expans\u00e3o humana, torna-se importante avaliar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o gato \n\ndom\u00e9stico e o homem em \u00e1reas naturais importantes para a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do gato bravo, \n\nconfrontando essa an\u00e1lise com o que se conhece da ecologia espacial e tr\u00f3fica do gato \n\ndom\u00e9stico em toda a sua \u00e1rea de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o. Deste modo, esta Tese focou os requisitos \n\necol\u00f3gicos do gato bravo e os constrangimentos relacionados com a presen\u00e7a humana e \n\nas suas actividades, em quatro cap\u00edtulos (Caps. 3, 4, 5 e 6) correspondentes a quatro \n\nartigos cient\u00edficos. No cap\u00edtulo 3, foi feita a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos principais descritores da \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de gato bravo em Espanha (uma vez que n\u00e3o existe informa\u00e7\u00e3o em Portugal \n\npara se poder fazer essa an\u00e1lise). Para tal, foram constru\u00eddos modelos para a zona \n\nAtl\u00e2ntica, Mediterr\u00e2nica e Espanha Continental usando um conjunto de descritores \n\nbaseados na informa\u00e7\u00e3o a uma escala mais fina. De onde resultou que, os descritores \n\nmais relevantes para o gato bravo \u00e0 escala mais fina mant\u00eam-se \u00e0 grande escala \n\n(Espanha), e em diferentes biomas: Atl\u00e2ntico e Mediterr\u00e2neo. O n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies de \n\n\n\n xvii \n\nmicromam\u00edferos e a diferen\u00e7a de altitude (este descritor est\u00e1 indirectamente associado \u00e0 \n\nocupa\u00e7\u00e3o humana) s\u00e3o as vari\u00e1veis mais importantes para descrever a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngato bravo na Peninsula Ib\u00e9rica. Nesta perspectiva, a presen\u00e7a humana \u00e9 uma quest\u00e3o-\n\nchave nas estrat\u00e9gias de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do gato bravo, o que justifica o investimento no \n\nconhecimento sobre as interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre os primeiros, os gatos dom\u00e9sticos e, \n\nconsequentemente, os seres humanos. No cap\u00edtulo 4, foi usada a informa\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a \n\nde gatos dom\u00e9sticos em 128 herdades da Zona Especial de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de Moura-\n\nBarrancos para analisar os factores ambientais e humanos que afectam a presen\u00e7a e o \n\nn\u00famero de gatos em cada herdade, com recurso \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos lineares \n\ngeneralizados. Para al\u00e9m disso, foi feito o r\u00e1dio seguimento de oito gatos dom\u00e9sticos (5 \n\nmachos e 3 f\u00eameas), cuja informa\u00e7\u00e3o relativa ao tamanho das suas desloca\u00e7\u00f5es di\u00e1rias \n\nfoi relacionado com um grupo de vari\u00e1veis independentes (sexo, esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano, habitat, \n\nfactores humanos) recorrendo \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos generalizados mistos. Como \n\nresultados mais relevantes deste trabalho salienta-se a depend\u00eancia do gato dom\u00e9stico \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o humana, estando a sua abund\u00e2ncia associada aos recursos \n\nalimentares fornecidos pelas pessoas. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 dimens\u00e3o dos seus movimentos \n\ndi\u00e1rios estes reflectem uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o negativa com a presen\u00e7a de outros carn\u00edvoros, em \n\nparticular com a raposa Vulpes vulpes. No capitulo 5, foi feita a an\u00e1lise ao conte\u00fado de \n\n407 excrementos de Felis sp recolhidos em nove latrinas situadas no, e perto, do S\u00edtio \n\nMoura-Barrancos, sendo as mesmas caracterizadas de acordo com a sua dist\u00e2ncia a \n\ncasas. Com recurso a an\u00e1lise multivariada os excrementos foram agrupados com base na \n\ndiferen\u00e7a dos itens que os constituem. Os restos da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o humana, associados aos \n\nexcrementos recolhidos em latrinas perto de casas, e o consumo de coelho bravo, \n\nassociado \u00e0s latrinas afastadas de casas, deram o contributo mais significativo para a \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o dos grupos de excrementos. O mesmo tipo de abordagem e an\u00e1lise foi \n\nfeita com recurso a uma revis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica de estudos (n=57) sobre a ecologia tr\u00f3fica \n\ndo gato dom\u00e9stico no Mundo, que revelaram similitudes entre as zonas urbanas e \n\nnaturais, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s ilhas. Em ambas as an\u00e1lises, escala da \u00e1rea de estudo e \n\nmundial, ficou expressa a depend\u00eancia do gato dom\u00e9stico pelos recursos alimentares \n\ndisponibilizados pelo homem. No cap\u00edtulo 6, foram utilizados vinte cinco artigos \n\npublicados com informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a preval\u00eancia de seis agentes virais (FcoV \u2013 \n\nCoronav\u00edrus Felino, FIV - Imunodefici\u00eancia Felina, FeLV \u2013 Leuc\u00e9mia Felina, FPV \u2013 \n\nPanleucop\u00e9nia Felina, FCV - Caliciv\u00edrus Felino e FHV \u2013 Herpesv\u00edrus Felino) nas \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es de gato dom\u00e9stico, gato bravo, gato do deserto Felis Margarita e o gato \n\n\n\n xviii \n\nleopardo de Iriomote Felis irimotensis em trinta e seis \u00e1reas distribu\u00eddas por cinco \n\ncontinentes. Para entender a influ\u00eancia do ambiente (ilhas, \u00e1reas naturais, rurais e \n\nurbanas), da esp\u00e9cie, e da preval\u00eancia de cada um dos seis agentes virais na ocorr\u00eancia \n\nde cada um dos seis v\u00edrus, foram utilizados modelos lineares generalizados, em que a \n\nvari\u00e1vel dependente corresponde \u00e0 presen\u00e7a/aus\u00eancia de cada tipo de v\u00edrus por amostra. \n\nO ambiente e a esp\u00e9cie estiverem presentes nos melhores modelos para FIV, FCoV e \n\nFPV, enquanto a preval\u00eancia de outros v\u00edrus foi significante para os modelos de FeLV, \n\nFCV e FHV. A preval\u00eancia de FIV aparece correlacionada com a sociabilidade da \n\nesp\u00e9cie, com incid\u00eancia para as zonas rurais e urbanas. A ocorr\u00eancia de FIV e FeLV, \n\nque necessitam do contacto para a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o, afecta a ocorr\u00eancia de outros v\u00edrus.   \n\nFinalmente, no cap\u00edtulo 7 (discuss\u00e3o) faz-se um resumo das implica\u00e7\u00f5es para a \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o do gato bravo mediante v\u00e1rios cen\u00e1rios de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o humana em \u00e1reas \n\nnaturais, de acordo com os impactos das suas actividades (agricultura, pecu\u00e1ria e \n\ncineg\u00e9tica) e presen\u00e7a /abund\u00e2ncia de gatos dom\u00e9sticos.   \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: gato dom\u00e9stico Felis catus, gato bravo Felis silvestris, Modela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\necol\u00f3gica, Ecologia tr\u00f3fica, Ecologia espacial, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, Leucemia felina (FeLV), \n\nImunodefici\u00eancia felina (FIV), Impacto do Homem em \u00e1reas Naturais Mediterr\u00e2nicas \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n xix \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1.

General Introduction \n\n1.1 HUMAN PRESENCE AND NATURAL VALUES IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA \n\nConservation of natural values is one of the major concerns in the modern world. It does \n\nnot merely deal with the preservation of endangered species, but also with dramatic \n\nchanges in ecosystems and landscapes (Deem et al. 2001). In recent years the concept of \n\nbiodiversity is gaining popularity, with the ecosystems as the principal conservation \n\ntargets, combining genetic diversity within populations, community structure (species \n\nrichness and composition), and landscape heterogeneity. In this context, the \n\nMediterranean Basin is one of the richest places in the world in terms of animal and \n\nplant species and was recognized as one of 34 biodiversity hotspots with almost all taxa \n\nexhibit high levels of diversity, at both the specific and subspecific levels (Mittermeier \n\net al. 2004). \n\nContrasting with most taxa, the mammal fauna of the Mediterranean is largely derived \n\nfrom the Eurasian and African biogeographic zones and therefore exhibits relatively low \n\nlevels of endemism, once most species tend to have very wide ranges (Temple and \n\nCuttelod 2009). However, in the Mediterranean thirty eight carnivore species can be \n\nfound, two of which endemic with the highlight towards the world\u2019s most endangered \n\nfelid - the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus (Temple and Cuttlelod 2009). The evolutionary \n\nmechanisms of such diversification have been related to conditions and opportunities \n\nultimately generated by the environmental and historical peculiarities offered by the \n\ngeographic location and configuration of the Mediterranean areas (e.g. insularity, \n\npeninsula-rich shoreline, climatic seasonality, habitat heterogeneity, etc) (Garcia-Barros \n\net al. 2002). Located in the West of the Mediterranean region, the Iberian Peninsula is \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 4 \n\ncharacterized by well-marked seasons, with dry and hot summers and wet and mild \n\nwinters. Broadly, the region encompasses two plateaus in the centre, dominated by \n\nextensive cereal farming interspersed by patches of sclerophylous vegetation, agro-\n\nforestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean scrubland and forest. Dividing \n\nand surrounding these plateaus, several mountain systems are found, where large areas \n\nof Mediterranean scrublands and forests are preserved. In North and Northwest Atlantic \n\nareas of Iberia, the mixed and broad-leaved forests of deciduous species are the \n\ndominant vegetation, with imbibed patches of pastureland, allowing for a rich \n\ncommunity of predators and prey in these landscapes. All these landscapes are the result \n\nof millenary transformations, product of the interaction between natural, antropic, and \n\nhistorical factors, as these ecosystems have experienced a long and intense history of \n\nhuman influence (Blondel 2006). Early hominids (eg, Homo erectus) migrated out of \n\nAfrica, through Mediterranean lands, into Europe and Asia. Thereafter, modern humans \n\ncolonized the Mediterranean Basin (Mannion 1999) c. 10 000 years ago. This was a \n\nturning point in cultural and environmental history. Humans domesticated certain plants \n\nand animals, such as wheat, barley, sheep, cattle and goats, and the ecosystems were \n\nsubject to modification. Land management was in the context of a self-sufficient \n\neconomy in which exchanges with the outside world were scarce (ovine transhumance \n\nand few agricultural and metal imports), leading to a highly humanised landscape with \n\ngreat ecological and cultural diversity (Crowling et al. 1996, Garc\u00eda-Ruiz and Valero \n\n1998). The progressive replacement of deciduous broad-leaved forests by evergreen \n\nsclerophyllous forests and scrubland, in combination with increasing habitat patchiness \n\nover time, affected both the distribution of populations and species and their genetic \n\ndiversity (Blondel 2006). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 5 \n\n1.1.1 Effects of landscape humanisation on wildlife \n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rural areas of the Iberian Peninsula \n\nsuffered the massive emigration of people towards cities and the consequent \n\nabandonment of traditional agricultural uses, with the consequent decrease in livestock \n\nnumbers (Lasanta et al. 2006, MacDonald et al. 2000). The cause of this \n\nmarginalization was the intensification of agriculture in flat areas, due to an increased \n\nproductivity caused by mechanisation, use of chemical fertilisers and irrigation \n\nmechanisms (Preiss et al. 1997, Macdonald et al. 2000). As a consequence, the \n\nagricultural production in mountainous areas was less competitive, with higher \n\nproduction costs because of smaller property sizes, higher complexity in property \n\nstructure, higher difficulty in using machinery and lower soil fertility. At this point, \n\nconflicts between people and wildlife, particulary predators intensified because of \n\ncompetition for shared, limited resources due to landscape changes (Odden et al. 2002, \n\nGraham et al. 2005, Kaartinen et al. 2009). This includes deforestation, intensification \n\nof pastoral agriculture, loss of arable agriculture, disturbance of natural fire regimes, \n\nmining, urbanization, tourism, pollution and the introduction of alien species \n\n(Perevolotsky and Seligman 1998, Rodriguez and Delibes 2004, Oliveira et al. 2008). \n\nThe actual landscape of Iberia is therefore the result of a subtle interaction between \n\necological and anthropogenic processes occurring at each successional stage, and many \n\nspecies opportunistically took advantage of the gradual changes induced by people in \n\nthe landscape, becoming hostages of agricultural and grazing activities. At this stage \n\nand over time, people conducted small shrub removal to facilitate cattle grazing or \n\naccede to new exploitation areas, contributing to shape a highly diverse landscape. For \n\nspecies, such as the wolf Canis lupus signatus, some large ungulates are reduced due to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 6 \n\nhunting and habitat changes (Graham et al. 2005), but this was compensated with the \n\nabundance of live livestock and their carcasses (sheep, goats, Iberian pigs and cattle) \n\nand increased populations of wildboard Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus \n\n(Vos 2000). The traditional farming system, therefore, beyond promoting heterogeneity \n\nin the landscape, represented an important food resource for large predators and \n\nscavenging species (Vos 2000, Lasanta et al. 2006). European rabbits are native to the \n\nIberian Peninsula (Monnerot et al. 1994), and from the late Pleistocene until Classic \n\nAntiquity, they were mostly restricted to the place of origin. Because of that, in Iberian \n\nMediterranean ecosystems, rabbits are a keystone species for approximately 40 Iberian \n\npredators (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008), including two highly endangered species: the \n\nIberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial eagle Aquila adalberti. \n\n1.1.1.1 Interactions between people and carnivores  \n\nThe traditional agriculture practices promoted the existence of edges between different \n\ntypes of habitat, with particular relevance when it relates to pastures and high-cover \n\nvegetation. Many game species, like rabbits and red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa, \n\nuse this mosaic landscape and are followed by a diversity of predators. Responding to \n\nthese sustainable rural activities, several carnivore species became directly or indirectly \n\nlinked to the landscape changes made by man that influenced their population trends. In \n\nfact, of the 15 species of existing Iberian carnivores (Temple and Cuttelod 2009), six \n\n(red fox Vulpes vulpes, common genet Geneta geneta, Egyptian mongoose Herpestes \n\nicnheumon, European badger Males males, stone marten Martes foina and weasel \n\nMustela nivalis) managed to adapt to these changes, in some cases even taking \n\nadvantage of the opportunities provided by human activities (Treves and Karanth 2003). \n\nInversely, for other carnivore species, human activities had a strong negative impact on \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n\ntheir populations, especially for those highly sensitive to disturbance, like brown bear \n\nUrsus actus, the Iberian Lynx and the European wildcat Felis silvestris (Rodriguez and \n\nDelibes 1990, Stahl and Artois 1994, Naves et al. 2003). Not all human activities, \n\nand/or its intensity, had equal effects on sensitive carnivores and if some clearly \n\npromoted population reductions (e.g persecution, shelter reduction) (Villafuerte et al. \n\n1998, Rodriguez and Delibes 2004), other favoured some species expansion by \n\nproviding additional food resources. Traditional agricultural practices, for instance, \n\nincreased the landscape mosaics, promoting the diversity and abundance of prey, and \n\ngenerated new opportunities for carnivores (Lozano et al. 2003). Even some of the more \n\nsensitive medium-sized carnivores (such as Iberian lynx and wildcat) compensate the \n\nimpact of human disturbance with prey resources offered in these traditional small-scale \n\nagricultural landscapes, such as wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and rodents. \n\nRecent studies reinforce the association between Mediterranean vegetation and \n\ncarnivore\u2019s requirements, directly as shelter and indirectly through its relation with food \n\nresources availability (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995, Lozano et al. 2003, Fern\u00e1ndez et \n\nal. 2006). For example, the wildcat and the Iberian lynx are known to use habitat \n\necotones as foraging areas due to their higher rabbit abundance (Lozano et al. 2003, \n\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003, Fern\u00e1ndez 2005, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006) or rodents in forest edges \n\n(Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004, Klar et al. 2008). However, extensive activities such as those related \n\nwith the plantation of production forests (e.g. eucalyptus) or that of cereals, may have \n\ncaused local extinctions or, at least, significant population size reductions (Andren \n\n1994, Inchausti et al. 2005).  \n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 8 \n\n1.1.1.2 People - carnivore conflicts \n\nLivestock predation by mammalian large carnivores is one of the most frequent sources \n\nof conflict between humans and wildlife throughout the world (Graham et al. 2005, \n\nKaartinen et al. 2009). Perceived economic losses due to livestock depredation often \n\nlead to retaliatory responses by agro-pastoralists. For example, the main problem faced \n\nby Iberian wolf conservation is the high level of livestock depredation throughout the \n\nIberian Peninsula (Petrucci-Fonseca 1990, Reig et al. 1985, Cuesta et al. 1991, Vos \n\n2000). In the case of the brown bear, forestry and agricultural practices and intensive \n\ngrazing led this carnivore to prey on livestock and, because of cattle abundance and \n\nforaging competition, the conflict increased (Clevenger et al. 1994, Naves et al. 2003). \n\nRoads and other infrastructures represent the new impacts on species, with great \n\nrelevance in carnivore populations (Ferreras et al. 1992). In fact, there is a close \n\nrelationship between the occurrence of preferred carnivore habitats and low human \n\ndisturbance levels with the number of carnivore fatalities, and the vulnerability of some \n\nspecies to particular features of roads. As the road network extends across the landscape \n\nand traffic volumes intensify, researchers have documented that roads and traffic may \n\naffect some carnivore populations in three general ways: they may increase mortality, \n\nlimit mobility including access to resources, and decrease the habitat amount and \n\nquality (e.g. Trombulak and Frissell 2000, Grilo et al. 2009). Because carnivores have \n\nsmall populations, tend to live at low densities and occupy large home-ranges, they are \n\nparticularly vulnerable to roads expansion. Road mortality is a major threat for \n\nEuropean wildcats (Klar et al 2009) and roads may also have a repulsive effect on \n\nwildcats influencing their habitat selection (Klar et al. 2008).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 9 \n\nSeveral decades ago in the Iberian Peninsula, hunting was an important cultural and \n\nsocial activity, which was mostly non-commercial. The number of private areas devoted \n\nto big game hunting is increasing in Portugal and Spain. Management of these areas \n\nmay thus neglect smaller hunting species (e.g., wild rabbits, Iberian hares Lepus \n\ngranatensis and red legged partridges), and especially in the case of intensively \n\nexploited areas (Rodr\u00edguez and Delibes 2004, Lozano et al. 2007), where modern \n\nagriculture change the original landscape matrix to a homogeneous landscape of \n\nirrigated crop fields or promotes large scrubland extensions for big game. Nevertheless, \n\nin many areas the small game hunting still is an important activity, particularly in poor \n\nrural areas, and plays an important socio-economic role, generating income and \n\nproviding employment and recreation, particularly in rural areas, leading to new \n\nproblems for carnivore populations. Besides habitat modification and release of farm-\n\nreared game, the most common game management practices in small game areas \n\ninclude legal and illegal predator control (Virg\u00f3s and Travaini 2005, Beja et al. 2008). \n\nThis practice was more intensive in the past, with the state-sponsored campaigns to \n\neliminate predators  during late 1930s to late 1960s in Portugal and from 1950s to the \n\nmid 1970s in Spain (Villafuerte et al. 1998, Beja et al. 2008), resulting in drastic \n\npopulation declines and regional extinctions (Garz\u00f3n 1974). The use of poison, snares \n\nand traps was widespread, resulting in the strong decline of some carnivore species \n\n(Rodriguez and Delibes 1990, Duarte and Vargas 2001, \u00c1lvares 2003). Although state-\n\nsupported and legal killing ended in the mid-1970s, this activity continues, both through \n\nlegal methods (shooting or trappings of Egyptian mongooses and red foxes in Portugal \n\nand red fox in Spain) and illegal and non-selective techniques. (Duarte and Vargas \n\n2001, Virg\u00f3s and Travaini 2005, Beja et al. 2008).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 10 \n\n1.1.1.3 Role of domestic carnivores as reservoirs of infectious agents to \n\nwildlife   \n\nThe expansion of agriculture and livestock production near or inside natural areas \n\npromotes contact between human populations and their livestock with wild carnivores \n\n(Macdonald et al. 2000). This close contact facilitates the spread of infectious agents \n\nand parasites to new hosts and environments, thus establishing new relationships \n\nbetween hosts and parasites, and new ecological niches in the chain of disease \n\ntransmission (Altizer et al. 2003). The host-pathogen relationship has therefore suffered \n\nan imbalance caused mainly by environmental changes due to human activity (Daszak \n\net al. 2000, Deem et al. 2001), frequently associated with the introduction of pathogens \n\ninto wild populations and changes in the host\u2019s susceptibility to infections (Grenfell and \n\nDobson 1995). Incidence itself depends on the relation between population size, density, \n\nand rate of contact for efficient disease transmission. An important factor is the social \n\norganisation of domestic hosts, that can influence parasite prevalence and population \n\ndynamics. For example, although the prevalence of FeLV increased with group size in \n\ndomestic cats, FIV prevalence decreases with increasing group size (Fromont et al. \n\n1997). FeLV transmission is enhanced in larger groups with non-aggressive contacts. \n\nFIV is transmitted by biting and occurrs almost exclusively among adult males that \n\nfought to maintain dominance hierarchies. Some epidemics originated in reservoir \n\nspecies caused important declines in endangered species. Examples of this are the \n\ncanine distemper outbreak in the last remaining wild colony of black footed ferrets \n\nMustela nigripes in 1985, that was transmitted by feral dogs and killed over 70% of the \n\npopulation, (Thorne and williams 1988), the canine distemper epidemic of 1994 in the \n\nSerengeti lion Panthera leo population, transmitted by domestic dogs from people \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n\npopulations adjacent to Massai Mara national park that caused mortality in \n\napproximately 30% of individuals (Roelke-Parker et. al 1996), and  the decline of \n\nAfrican wild dog population Lycaon picus, during a canine distemper epizootic in \n\ndomestic dogs in the Serengeti (Alexander and Appel 1994). Beyond virus, bacterial \n\ninfections are also important causes of mortality in wild carnivores. In felids, the \n\ninfected carcasses (cape buffalo, deer, fallow deer or wild board) with bovine \n\ntuberculosis are considered to be the primary route of infection by Mycobacterium \n\nbovis. In some regions of Kruger National Park, up to 90% of the lions have been \n\nexposed to tuberculosis and the disease has spread to cheetahs and leopards presumably \n\ndue to scavenging of buffalo carcasses (Keet et al. 1996). In southern Iberian Peninsula, \n\nthere is a high prevalence of tuberculosis in wild ungulates and wild boards related to \n\nthe high density of animals in hunting or protected areas (Gort\u00e1zar et al. 2008). \n\nHowever, the potential role of wild animals in the maintenance and spread of M. bovis \n\ninfection in domestic livestock is of particular importance in countries where \n\neradication programs have substantially reduced the incidence of bovine tuberculosis \n\nbut sporadic outbreaks still occur. The best-known examples are the European badger in \n\nthe United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (Nolan and Wilesmith 1994, Gallager \n\nand Clifton-Hadley 2000) and the possum Trichosurus vulpecula in New Zealand \n\n(Coleman and Cooke 2001). Transmission of infectious agents from cattle to wildlife \n\n(and vice versa) may have several routes. First, the territories of wild and domesticated \n\nanimals overlap because they share feeding grounds and drinking ponds, and crowding \n\nof animals at watering ponds, may facilitate close contact and thus may lead to \n\nincreased transmission by the respiratory route (Aranaz et al. 1996, Cosivi et al. 1998). \n\nSecond,  the persistence in infected animals after death may be a source of infection for \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 12 \n\nscavengers, providing the large dose of microorganisms needed for infection by the \n\nalimentary route (Aranaz et al. 1996). \n\n 1.2 THE EUROPEAN WILDCAT \n\n1.2.1 Distribution and spatial ecology \n\nWith a wide distribution in the past, the European wildcat probably covered all the \n\nforested regions of Western, Central and Southern Europe, Caucasus and Asia (Stahl \n\nand Artois 1994). Extinction events in many areas of its range, which took place \n\nbetween the end of the eighties and the early twenties, led to the decline and \n\nfragmentation of the original population and justify the present high vulnerability faced \n\nby the species. Thus, the wildcat is now only present in less populated and relatively \n\nisolated areas (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Germany), the Balkans, \n\nCarpathians, Caucasus and Asia, in addition to a few island populations in Scotland, \n\nSicily, and probably Corsica (Stahl and L\u00e9ger 1992). Because of the species decline in \n\nseveral areas of its European distribution, the wildcat is now limited to mountains of \n\nmedium and low altitude with little human disturbance (Stahl and Artois 1994). The \n\nspecies habitat requirements are still not well known but several evidences link the \n\nwildcat to high understorey vegetation cover (Lozano et al. 2003, Mangas et al. 2008), \n\nalthough it also uses riparian galleries along the rivers and stream valleys, among other \n\nhigh-cover habitats, as well as rocky areas, (Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009). In \n\nthe Mediterranean environments, at landscape level the species seems mainly associated \n\nto mosaics of scrubland and pastureland and at the microhabitat level to high shrub \n\ncover (Lozano et al. 2003). Like most felines wildcats are solitary and largely nocturnal \n\nresting in hidden thickets, dens or forests by day and patrolling and hunting at night \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 13 \n\n(Sandell 1989). Males and females come together solely to mate in mid-winter and for \n\nthe rest of their lives the cats are alone (Sandell 1989). Although physical encounters \n\nare rare, wildcats regularly communicate with each other through scent, and territorial \n\nboundaries are marked with faeces or sprays (Stahl and Leger 1992). The wildcat home \n\nrange size varies along its distribution range and even locally in the same region, with \n\nvalues ranging between 1.95 and 50.17 km2 for males and 0.69 to 13.85 km2 for females \n\n(Stahl and Artois 1994, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004, Monterroso et al. 2009).  \n\n1.2.2 Food requirements \n\nDespite consuming a large diversity of prey, from insects to rabbits, the stable prey \n\nspecies for the wildcat in most of its range are small mammals (Cond\u00e9 et al. 1972, \n\nSl\u00e1dek 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Mole\u00f3n and Gil-S\u00e1nchez 2003, Carvalho \n\nand Gomes 2004). However, in Mediterranean-type environments, such as those found \n\nin the centre and south of the Iberian Peninsula, wild rabbits appear as the main prey for \n\nthe wildcat (Ferreira 2003, Malo et al. 2004, Lozano et al 2006). \n\n1.2.3 Main threats \n\nIn 1992, the European Council underlined two main threats that relate to the extinction \n\nrisk for wildcat: habitat destruction, resulting in population fragmentation and isolation \n\n(Stahl and Artois 1994, Nowel and Jackson 1996, Lozano et al. 2003, Klar et al 2008), \n\nand hybridisation with domestic cat, which may threaten the status of wildcat as a \n\ngenetically distinct species (Hubbard et al. 1992). The intense land-cover transformation \n\nof Central European landscapes has left forests as almost the only sheltering vegetation, \n\ndecreasing the amount of available habitat for the wildcat and the distance to human-\n\nrelated land use types like settlements, single houses and roads (Klar et al. 2008). For \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n\nexample, Langley and Yalden (1977) stated that wildcat population decline in the \n\nBritish Isles was a consequence of deforestation, despite claiming that wildcat was not a \n\ntypical forest species. This reduction of vegetation cover in large areas had \n\nconsequences to wildcat populations that resulted in the disappearance of the species in \n\nseveral European areas and population isolation in the regions with more conservation \n\nvalue (Stahl and Artois 1994). This situation promotes the contact with domestic cats \n\nand, as consequence, introgressive hybridization occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996). \n\nExtensive hybridization was described in Hungary and Scotland (Beaumont et al. 2001, \n\nDaniels et al. 2001, Pierpaoli et al. 2003), contrasting with the low levels of \n\nhybridization found in wildcat populations of Iberia, Germany and Italy (Randi and \n\nRagni 1991, Lecis et al. 2006, Oliveira et. al 2008) that therefore have high \n\nconservation value and should be actively protected (Pierpaoli et al. 2003). Many \n\nencounters between wildcats and domestic cats are agonistic, with wildcats sometimes \n\nkilling the latter and this could be a barrier to hybridization (Hubbard et al. 1992). \n\nAnother important threat to wildcat is predator control activities, especially in small \n\ngame hunting areas (Virg\u00f3s and Travaini 2005). \n\n \n\n1.3 THE DOMESTIC CAT \n\n1.3.1 Domestication, range expansion and \u201cferalization\u201d  \n\nDomestic cats have accompanied humanity in all phases of exploration and \n\ncolonization, and have been accidentally or deliberately introduced to many terrestrial \n\necosystems of the world (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986, Fitzgerald and Turner 2000). In \n\nrural areas, the available food is less than in urban and suburban areas and cats depend \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 15 \n\ngreatly on people to feed them. Cat populations exhibit varying degrees of dependence \n\non people. Stray cats - cats found in and around cities, towns and rural properties \n\ndepending on some resources provide by people. Feral cats \u2013 cats that live and \n\nreproduce in the wild and survive by hunting or scavenging. People satisfy none of their \n\nneeds intentionally. Recruitment to the stray and feral groups from the domestic \n\npopulation constantly occurs from the pet population. However, it is important to \n\nremember that all are domestic species Felis catus and that stray and feral cats are \n\nsimply an introduction of that domestic species to the urban, suburban and natural \n\nenvironment.  \n\n1.3.2 Distribution and population numbers \n\nDomestic cats, as dogs, are the carnivore species with a wider distribution range, \n\noccurring in all continents, and are currently one of the biggest problems and challenges \n\nof wildlife conservation (Macdonald and Thom 2001). In contrast with wildcats, \n\ndomestic cats easily find food and shelter in human settlements (Barratt 1997, Germain \n\net al. 2008). It is in populate cities, with an inexhaustible source of food that domestic \n\ncats reach unimaginable numbers; for example in the streets of the United States there \n\nare about 30 million \u2018stray\u2019-\u2018feral\u2019 cats (Grimm 2009). There are however large \n\nvariations in the relation between people and domestic cats, from urban to rural areas \n\nwhere they have total freedom of movement and probably less control by man. Human \n\nsettlements can be quite diverse in their resource availability for domestic cats \n\n(Bradshaw et al. 1999): large villages and cities concentrate human structures and \n\nsupport higher human densities and consequently of cats, while rural villages and farms \n\nshow a more dispersed pattern of occupation with lower rates of human population \n\ndistributed over a larger area and less cats. Free-ranging domestic cats live close to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 16 \n\nhuman settlements, and their home-range size varies with human density and with food \n\navailability and distribution (Liberg and Sandell, 1988). At very low densities (less than \n\n10 cats km-2), as in low humanised natural-rural areas, the cats home ranges are larger \n\nand the intra-specific encounters are uncommon (Kerby and Mcdonald 1988); in high-\n\ndensity areas these environments favour the contact between domestic cats and other \n\ncarnivore species. Size and stability of domestic cat populations depend therefore on a \n\nlocal combination of favourable environmental variables providing food and refuge that \n\nallow, on average, a positive population growth. Other important factors for domestic \n\ncats population growth are the interactions with other local species (mainly predation \n\nand competition), the dispersal abilities of the species between the population groups \n\n(Soberon and Peterson 2005, Soberon 2007) and disease dynamics. \n\n1.3.3 Main impacts on wildlife \n\nIn many cases, domestic cats have adapted with great success to the ecosystem where \n\nthey were introduced and have become dominant predators, as documented in many \n\nislands (Nogales and Medina 1996), where their impact is quite relevant particularly on \n\nbreeding seabird colonies (Matias and Catry 2008) and endemic species (Rodriguez-\n\nMoreno et al. 2007). In addition to the predatory impact on other species, this successful \n\ninvader acts as reservoir in the transmission of numerous diseases (Artois and Remond \n\n1994, Courchamp et al. 1995, Fromont et al. 1997, Daniels et al. 1999). An extreme \n\nexample of this impact is that of the Iberian lynx, the most endangered feline of the \n\nworld, which transmission of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may be explained by close \n\ncontacts with domestic cats (Jessup et al. 1993, Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009). Another motif of \n\nconcern, as already mentioned (see 1.3.3), is introgressive hybridization with wildcats. \n\nMuch of the hybridization probably occurr in rural areas where the contact between the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 17 \n\ntwo species is more common. In fact, urban domestic cats consistently occupied smaller \n\nhome rangers than rural domestic ones (Devillard et al. 2003), and wildcat males \n\nprobably mated with female domestic cats.  \n\n \n\n1.4 AIMS AND STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS  \n\nThe European wildcat is a threatened species in most Europe, particularly in the central-\n\nnorth areas where suitable management of forests was considered crucial for its long-\n\nterm conservation (Stahl and Artois 1994). However, this recommendation may not \n\napply at the global level due to the lack of studies that support this assumption in the \n\nMediterranean region, where landscapes and the presence of people in natural areas are \n\nvery different from those in central-north Europe. No study has specifically addressed \n\nthe indirect effects of anthropogeneity (land use, hunting, cattle raising and \u201cferality\u201d of \n\ndomestic carnivores such as cats) on wildcat conservation. The conservation of wildcat \n\nin the constantly changing, human-altered landscapes of Southern Iberia requires \n\ntherefore a clear understanding of the species limits and capabilities in these \n\nenvironments. People provide food and shelter for domestic cats and persecute \n\ncarnivore species, like wildcat, during predator control campaigns. Domestic cat \n\npopulations are formed by small family groups around farms or/and in near villages, \n\nwhere they can reach high densities, compared to nearby wildcat population densities. \n\nThe domestic cat is then a host of, and the main vehicle for the transmission of disease \n\ninto the wildcat, if the probability of contact between the two species is high. Once \n\nwildcat populations do not reach high densities of individuals the inverse transmission \n\nis less probable. The same occurs with hybridization between the two species, probably \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 18 \n\nas result of domestic males moving into natural areas (dashed arrows in Figure 1 \n\nrepresents these scenarios).         \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Wildcat, domestic cat and human interactions in natural-rural areas. \n\nMy thesis focused on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by \n\nhuman-related activities. In natural-rural areas the wildcat constrains are clearly linked \n\nto human actions and activities, which determine the size and distribution of domestic \n\ncat populations, which will have an impact on wildcat-domestic cat interactions (Figure \n\n1). To achieve these general objectives, habitat evaluation and ranking schemes, as well \n\nas GIS-based modelling procedures, were combined with conventional and recent \n\ntechniques in the study of wildlife ecology of carnivores (trapping, radio-tracking and \n\nphoto-trapping). To analyse the data I applied statistical modelling and developed \n\ndistribution (wildcat and domestic cat) and spatially explicit models (domestic cat) to \n\nunderstand how species interact with landscape, human presence, other carnivores and \n\nprey. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. General Introduction \n \n \n \n\n 19 \n\nThe thesis is organised in five Parts that include seven chapters, including four \n\nindependent papers submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals (Chapters 3 to \n\n6) plus the general introduction (Chapter 1), the study area description (Chapter 2) and a \n\nsummary of the main findings supporting the discussion of its implications to wildcat \n\nconservation (Chapter 7). \n\n \n\nPART I  - INTRODUCTION  \n\nIn this part, was made a general introduction (chapter 1) about the topic and aims of this \n\nthesis.

Study Area \n\nThis thesis was conducted at two spatial levels. One corresponds to a large-scale analysis, \n\nusing the Iberian Peninsula as the study area (Paper I), and another at a finer-scale, \n\nconcentrating in a natural area of south-eastern Portugal. (Papers II and III)  \n\nIberian Peninsula \n\nThe Iberian Peninsula is located in the \n\nextreme southwest of Europe, being \n\nbordered by the Mediterranean Sea at the \n\nsoutheast and east, and by the Atlantic \n\nOcean on the north, west and south-west \n\n(Figure 2.1). The mountain system of the \n\nPyrenees, form the northeast edge of the \n\npeninsula, separating it from the rest of \n\nEurope. In spite of its relatively small size, \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula is not a homogeneous \n\narea neither in terms of climate nor in terms of vegetation. Its geographical location, exposure \n\nto marine influences, and hydrographic and orographic peculiarities, together with an ancient \n\nhuman occupation, originated a diverse mosaic of landscapes variying from arid to alpine -\n\ntype ecosystems (Castro et al. 1997). In fact, Iberian Peninsula encompasses two major \n\nbiogeographic regions: the Mediterranean, occupying the majority of the territory, and the \n\nAtlantic, more localized in the northern and north-western edges (Figure 2.2). \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Iberian Peninsula location \n\n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Study areas used at the two scales of analysis (Iberian Peninsula and Moura-Barrancos region, including the Natura 2000 Site).\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. Study area \n \n \n \n\n 35 \n\nMediterranean area of Iberian Peninsula - The Mediterranean-type area, which \n\noccupies most of Iberian Peninsula, is characterized by well-marked seasons with dry, \n\nhot summers and wet, mild winters (Castro et al. 1997). Broadly, this area encompasses \n\ntwo plateaus in the centre, dominated by extensive cereal farming interspersed by \n\nsclerophylous vegetation, agro-forestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean \n\nscrubland and forest. Several mountain systems are found dividing and surrounding \n\nthese plateaus, where large fragments of Mediterranean scrublands and forests are \n\npreserved. Forests are typically dominated by Quercus spp., mainly holm oak Quercus \n\nrotundifolia- or coniferous mainly pines Pinus spp (Castro et al. 1997). In these \n\nsystems, wild rabbits are abundant and represent a key-prey for many carnivores and \n\nraptors, including the wildcat, (Malo et al. 2004, Moreno et al. 2004, Lozano et al. \n\n2006). Other preys inhabiting the region include small mammals (13 species of \n\ninsectivores and rodents, according to (Palomo et al. 2007). Besides wildcat, 10 other \n\nspecies of carnivores can be found in this region, including two top-predators: the \n\nIberian wolf and the Iberian lynx.  \n\nAtlantic area of Iberian Peninsula - The Atlantic-type area occupies the mountainous \n\nareas of northern Spain and the north-western corner of Portugal, being relatively wet, \n\nwith mild winters, warm summers and regular precipitation throughout the year. In \n\ncontrast to the Mediterranean areas, natural landscapes are dominated by mixed and \n\nbroad-leaved forests of deciduous species. The agriculture is mainly restricted to \n\naltitude pastures, occurring in patches that are imbibed in a diversified matrix of \n\nforested areas. Topography is rough, limiting human occupancy in many areas. The \n\nstructure and diversity of the landscape promotes a rich community of small mammals \n\n(21 species of insectivores and rodents \u2013 Palomo et al. 2007), which is followed by an \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. Study area \n \n \n \n\n 36 \n\nalso diverse guild of carnivores (13 species \u2013 wildcats and wolves included). Wildcats \n\nin the Atlantic region feed mostly on small mammals, and are less dependent of the wild \n\nrabbit that lives at lower density and does not constitute a key- prey for predators. \n\nMoura-Barrancos Natura 2000 Site \n\nThe finer-scale research was conducted in a natural area of Guadiana river basin, \n\ncharacterized by a Mediterranean landscape. Located in the southeast of the Portuguese-\n\nSpanish border, between 38\u00ba13\u2019N - 37\u00ba57\u2019N and 7\u00ba24\u2019O - 6\u00ba59\u2019O, the Moura-Barrancos \n\nNatura 2000 Site has an overall area of 43309 ha (10000 ha of an evolving agro-forestry \n\nsystem) dominated by holm oak woodlands, scrubland patches and rocky areas along \n\nthe main valleys (Figure 3). Rivers, streams and creeks, with intermittent character, flow \n\nthrough scrubland areas of Mediterranean sclerophylous vegetation mixed with rocks. \n\nBesides other natural values, the Moura-barrancos site was created because it was one \n\nof the last strongholds of the Iberian lynx in Portugal (Pires and Fernandes 2003). \n\nIncluded in Mediterranean region, the site as a climate is characterized by mild winters \n\nand extremely hot summers (Carmel and Flather 2004), with average temperatures \n\nbetween&lt;18 and >22\u00b0C, respectively (Chicharo et al. 2001). Annual precipitation \n\nlevels vary between 400\u2013600 mm (Chicharo et al. 2001). Land-use is dominated by an \n\nagro-silvo-pastoral system, characterized by the combination of open tree cover with \n\ncattle grazing underneath. The human population density is low (between 10.7 and 17.1 \n\nhab/km\u00b2) concentrated in five small villages. Human settlements are concentrated in \n\nvillages and several farmhouses can be found scattered throughout the landscape, \n\nalthough most currently abandoned. Human activity is restricted to cattle raising, \n\nagriculture and game hunting. These conditions offer a very suitable habitat for \n\nwildcats, due to the presence of well preserved vegetation patches and connectivity \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. Study area \n \n \n \n\n 37 \n\nelements (e.g. river valleys) along the landscape. Because of human occupancy, that \n\ntranslates into the presence of stray-feral cats, the landscape context presents the ideal \n\nconditions for hybridization events with wildcats. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.

Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 42 \n\n \n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION \n\nUnderstand the relationships between the distribution of species and environmental \n\nvariability is one of the biggest issues in ecological research. The quantification of \n\nspecies-environment relationships not only represents the core of predictive \n\ngeographical modelling in ecology: also, it has important applications in conservation \n\npractice (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Schadt et al. 2002). Species distributions \n\nrespond to ecological processes operating simultaneously over a wide range of scales, \n\nfrom the spatial scale of individual movements to the scale of variability in species-level \n\nenvironmental constrains, e.g. climate (Karl et al. 2000, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003). Several \n\nauthors have identified correlative models as more appropriate at global, regional and \n\nlandscape scales than mechanistic models, which seem to be more accurate at finer \n\nspatial scales (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Johnson and Omland 2004, Helmuth et \n\nal. 2005). Nevertheless, the two model approaches presents some difficulties: the local \n\nscale of mechanistic models have problems in application across areas of distinct \n\nbiomes and the correlative approaches, with large scale application, have problems of \n\ninterpretation as a consequence of predictors changes across biomes. Many distribution \n\nmodels have been performed based on limiting factors at large spatial scales, like \n\nclimatic variables (Thuiller et al. 2004), not incorporate individual selection \n\nrequirements. Other models linkage the species distribution, at fine resolution, to \n\nvariables that are assumed to be relevant to individuals presence (Engler et al. 2004, \n\nPearce et al. 2001). Nevertheless, the significance of those variables in terms of \n\nindividuals requirements (resources) or limited population (ie mortality factors) is not \n\nalways clear.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 43 \n\nRegional scale predictive modelling is being used increasingly to identify the factors \n\nconditioning species distribution and to provide primary information for regional \n\nconservation programs (Mladenoff et al. 1999, Schadt et al. 2002, Naves et al. 2003, \n\nKlar et. al. 2008). These models are generally developed to test various hypotheses, as \n\nto how environmental factors control the distribution of species and communities \n\n(Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). Some models correlate environmental abiotic \n\nvariables influencing species ecology with presence/absence data distribution to identify \n\nsuitable areas for the species (correlative approach), while others considered to underlie \n\nthe observed correlations with environmental attributes (mechanist approach) by using a \n\ndetailed knowledge of the target species (Robertson et al. 2003).   \n\nMoreover, the distribution of a species is an expression of the regulatory mechanisms \n\nacting at the individual level, regarding species as requiring a set of resources and \n\nconditions in order to function (Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003). This approach explicitly takes \n\ninto account functional relationships between species and essential resources and/or \n\nconditions in their environment rather than using general vegetation types as surrogates \n\nfor species habitat (Vanreusel and Van Dyck, 2007).  \n\nWith detailed knowledge at fine scale of target species, namely data on individual \n\nrequirements (resources) and population limitations (e.g., mortality factors), we can \n\nformulate hypothesis that the species distribution reflects the regulatory mechanisms \n\nacting at the individual level. The distribution of these requirements can explain the \n\ndistribution of a species, knowing that other factors, like historical and geographical, \n\nalso play an important role in species distribution range (Gaston and Fuller 2009).        \n\nThus the main goal is to test the hypothesis: Can species distribution at large scale to be \n\nmodel using fine scale information, knowing that species requirements vary across \n\nbiomes?  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 44 \n\nFor that was choosing a European Wildcat Felis silvestris, a species with a large \n\ngeographic range, occurring in different biomes, but had suffered a contraction in their \n\nhistorical range. \n\nThe widespread decline of wildcat populations between late eighteenth and early \n\ntwentieth centuries, results in the fragmentation and extinction of many populations of \n\nWestern and Central Europe (Stahl and Leger 1992). Previous studies indicate that the \n\nspecies selects areas with low density of humans, settlements and transport \n\ninfrastructures (Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) (Szemeyhy 1992, Klar et al. \n\n2008) (Klar et al. 2008, Santos et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) and dense \n\nvegetation cover (Lozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006, Klar et al. 2008, Santos et \n\nal. 2008). Few studies exist in Mediterranean landscapes, where the species seems \n\nmainly associated to mosaics of scrubland and pastureland (Lozano et al. 2003). \n\nRegarding resource requirements, wildcats consume a large diversity of prey but small \n\nmammals are dominant in their diet in most areas of its distribution range (Cond\u00e9 et al. \n\n1972, Sl\u00e1dek, 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Mole\u00f3n and Gil-S\u00e1nchez 2003, \n\nCarvalho and Gomes, 2004). However wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) become the \n\nmain prey in most of the Mediterranean environments, such as the central and southern \n\nregions of the Iberian Peninsula (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et al. 1999, Lozano et al \n\n2006, Monterroso et al. 2009). \n\nTo accomplish the proposal goal was test if habitat factors operating at the level of \n\nindividuals explain broad-scale distribution patterns of the wildcat. The fine scale \n\nvariables that had great influence in species presence were included in more general \n\ndescriptors that can be interpretive across the species distribution range. For this, was \n\nassessed the agreement between predictions from resource-based habitat selection \n\nmodels and the broad-scale species distribution in Spain. The fine scale descriptors \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 45 \n\ndirectly linked to resource requirements by individuals were used to create broader \n\ndescriptors: vegetation cover, food availability and human disturbance to evaluate the \n\nfollowing hypotheses:  \n\nH1) Prey diversity (small mammals and wild rabbits) is the single explanatory factor of \n\nwildcat distribution; H2) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and human disturbance \n\ninteract; H3) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and vegetation cover providing \n\nrefuge/shelter are the limiting factors, human disturbance being not important; H4) All \n\nthree factors are equally. These descriptors reflect the more important variables for \n\nwildcat in fine scale studies, with special relevance for prey availability that is reference \n\nfor most autors (Lozano et al. 2006). The human disturbance seems to play as well an \n\nimportant role in wildcat distribution (Klar et al. 2008, Santos et al. 2008, Monterroso \n\net al. 2009).  \n\nMoreover, we explored whether a single correlative-mechanistic hybrid model may \n\npredict the species distribution across distinct biomes. The wildcat explore different \n\nresources in the various biomes where occurs. In Atlantic areas the wildcat prey mainly \n\nrodents while in Mediterranean the main prey is the rabbits (Lozano et al. 2006). The \n\nhabitats preferred by the species in Atlantic areas are mixed and broad leave forest \n\nselecting the sclerophylous vegetation in the Mediterranean (Klar et al. 2008, Lozano et \n\nal. 2003).   \n\nThe evaluation of model performance in distinct biomes was necessary to evaluate the \n\neffects of the various descriptors, and related hypothesis, with wildcat distribution \n\nrange.  The challenge is to incorporate the advantages of both approaches to develop \n\nlarge-scale models that express the local requirements for wide-ranging species \n\noccurring in distinct biomes. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 46 \n\n3.2 METHODS \n\n3.2.1 Study area \n\nThe wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula was study, which includes a \n\nrepresentation of two biomes: Atlantic and Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region, \n\nwhich occupies most of the continental Spain, is characterized by well-marked seasons \n\nwith dry, hot summers and wet, mild winters. Broadly, the region encompasses two \n\nplateaus in the centre, dominated by extensive cereal farming interspersed by \n\nsclerophylous vegetation, agro-forestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean \n\nscrubland and forest. Several Mountain systems are found dividing and surrounding \n\nthese plateaus, where higher fragments of Mediterranean scrublands and forests are \n\npreserved. Forests are typically dominated by Quercus spp. manly holm oak Quercus \n\nRotundifolia- or Pinus spp. Various studies have shown that wild rabbit are a key-prey \n\nfor wildcats in these systems. Other preys include smaller mammals: 13 species of \n\ninsectivorous and rodent mammals are present in the Mediterranean region. The \n\nAtlantic region occupies the mountainous areas of Northern Spain, being relatively wet, \n\nwith mild winters, warm summers and more regular precipitation throughout the year. \n\nIn contrast to Mediterranean areas, mixed and broad-leaved forests of deciduous species \n\nare dominant in natural areas. The agriculture are mainly pastures patches that imbibed \n\nin a diversify matrix with associated forest areas, to these landscape structure is \n\nassociated a rich community of small mammals. Topography is rough limiting human \n\noccupancy in many areas. Wildcats in the Atlantic region mostly feed on small \n\nmammals, which constitute a richer community of 21 insectivorous and rodent species \n\nbellowing to groups usually predated by carnivores. Wild rabbits are at low population \n\ndensities and do not constitute a significant prey in Atlantic ecosystems.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 47 \n\n3.2.2 Wildcat distribution data \n\nDistribution data of wildcat was compiled on the basis of a 10x10km UTM (Universal \n\nTransverse Mercator) grid. For Spain was used data from the National Atlas of \n\nMammals CITA, which congregates data collected after 1980 originating from \n\npublished information, museum collections, research centres, universities, besides a \n\nquestionnaire addressed to technicians belonging to the Natural Areas Network (for \n\nmore details see Palomo et al. 2007). Each evidence of presence was criteriously \n\nevaluated and excluded when considered not reliable. As for Portugal, a similar effort \n\nwas made using data from Natural history Museum of Lisbon and Instituto de \n\nConserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Natureza e Biodiversidade (ICNB) data base. The sampling effort could \n\nresult different is diluted once only 335 of the total 5327 squares for Spain include more \n\nthan one evidence of wildcat presence. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Predictors of wildcat distribution \n\nThe four hypothesis established reflected the known information collected at fine scale, \n\nmost according the individual selected resources, like habitat selection and diet of the \n\nwildcat studies. Base on these data we built tree main descriptors (food availability, \n\nVegetation cover and human disturbance) that could surrogates the influence of fine \n\nscale variables in species distribution at large scale, with the ultimate goal to model \n\nwildcat distribution in different biomes (Atlantic and Mediterranean) and in all \n\nContinental Spain, using a common simple predictors derived from local level of \n\ninformation.        \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 48 \n\n3.2.3.1 Food descriptors \n\nWildcats consume a large diversity of prey, but the stable prey species in most locations \n\nare the small mammals (Lozano et al. 2006). With the exceptions of Scotland and the \n\nmost of the Mediterranean areas of Iberian Peninsula were the rabbit abundances are \n\nhigh, the rodents and insectivorous (except bats) mammals represents the stable prey for \n\nwildcat along is distribution range (Cond\u00e9 et al. 1972, Sl\u00e1dek 1973, Hewson 1983, \n\nSarmento 1996, Mole\u00f3n and Gil-S\u00e1nchez 2003, Carvalho and Gomes 2004, Malo et al. \n\n2004). In fact, the marked Mediterranean Iberia the rabbits represents the stable prey for \n\nwildcat (Aymerich 1982, Sarmento 1996, Malo et al. 2004, Lozano et. al. 2006). The \n\nhigher trophic diversity in wildcat diet in Mediterranean climates is closely associated \n\nwith the wild rabbits consumption in opposite with lower trophic diversity in high \n\nlatitudes were the rodents are more consumed (Lozano et al. 2006). These corroborates \n\nthe idea that the rodents are more \u201cstaple-key-prey\u201d than wild rabbits, witch is \n\naccomplish the consumption of more secondary preys. The availability of a higher \n\nnumber of species (mainly Microtinae) enables greater independence from fluctuating \n\npopulation of prey species.  Suggesting that the number of small mammals species \n\ndetermines the presence of wildcat, with exception for Mediterranean areas were the \n\ndiversity of rodents is lower and the rabbits abundance is very important for the feline \n\noccurrence, these two main prey were considered as represent the food resources. \n\nThe small mammals diversity (Sm_N) represents the number of species of Insectivorous \n\nand Rodents presents in each 10x10 km squares of Spain. The Insectivorous species \n\nbelong to Soricomorpha Order, with the exception of Pyrenean desman Galemys \n\npyrenaicus and Neomys Genus that were not incorporated, once they are not referred as \n\nwildcat prey. In Rodentia Order, and for similar reason, the Alpine marmot Marmota \n\nmarmota was excluded. The rodents, insectivores and wild rabbit presence/absence data \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 49 \n\nwere obtained from the Spanish Atlas (Palomo et al. 2007). The rabbit (Rb_p) presence, \n\nonce data of species abundances for all 10x10km of Spain has not available, is an \n\nimportant food descriptor in most areas of Mediterranean Spain. \n\n3.2.3.2 Vegetation descriptors \n\nApparently the type of vegetation cover is not a determinant factor in the distribution of \n\nwildcat; this follows from the fact that the species be more generalist in the use of the \n\nhabitat and not strictly forestry, according to fine scale studies (Stahl and Artois 1994, \n\nLozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006 Monterroso et al. 2009). Nevertheless, fine \n\nscale studies suggest that wildcat preferential use broad leave and mixed forest (Ragny \n\n1981, Stahl and Artois 1994, McOrist and Kitchener 1994, Klar et al. 2008) in high \n\nlatitudes, like Spanish Atlantic biomes and scrubland in Mediterranean regions (Lozano \n\net al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006, Monterroso et al. 2009). So, we aggregated the \n\nvegetation types selected at fine scale by wildcat individuals in the two differentiate \n\nbiomes; Forest types from Atlantic and scrubland in Mediterranean, in one major \n\nvegetation descriptor representing the vegetation cover as explanatory factor of wildcat \n\ndistribution. \n\nTo test the hypothesis of the relevance of habitat quality in wildcat distribution was \n\nincluded a set of land use/land cover variables derived from the Corine Land Cover \n\n2000 map, representing a more fine-scale (scale 1:100 000. 150 m positional accuracy \n\nand with 25 ha minimum mapping unit) (EEA 2005) than the UTM 10x10 Km square. \n\nAccording to the wildcat favourable vegetation types the original eighteen Corine Land \n\nCover classes were reclassified in Vegetation Cover (Veg_cover) integrates 5 classes: \n\nincluding Broad-leaved Forest, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Transitional \n\nWoodland/Shrub and Sclerophylous Vegetation (Table 3.1).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 50 \n\n3.2.3.3 Human disturbance predictors \n\nBecause of the decline of their populations in several areas of its European distribution, \n\nthe wildcat is limited to mountainous areas of medium and low altitude, undisturbed by \n\nhuman activities (Stahl and Artois 1994, Heltai et al. 2006). The importance of \n\nelevation range as a positive predictor of threatened species richness globally may result \n\nfrom influence of topography on the occurrence of species at fine scale (Jetz et al. 2004, \n\nMonterroso et al. 2009) and their inherent associated vulnerability (Manne et al. 1999). \n\nAlternatively, in some cases this occurrence may result from range contractions from \n\nhuman-impacted lower elevation areas leaving remnant populations in more \n\nmountainous regions. Nevertheless, the number and distribution of households and \n\nhuman settlements can differ from people density. These human structures changed in \n\nshape distribution: large villages and cities concentred the human settlements and \n\nhighest values of people density, or a dispersal occupation with lower rates of human \n\npopulation but distributed by a largest area represents different disturbance scenarios for \n\nthe wildcat. In both cases the elevation range represents areas with lowest people \n\ndensities and human settlements. Other human impacts are related with habitat \n\ndestruction (Santos et al. 2008, Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) and road \n\nkill/disturbance (Vogt 1985, Klar et al. 2008, Klar et al. 2009). Fine-scale monitoring \n\nshowed that wildcats were aware of roads as an obstacle and only a limited number of \n\nmajor roads can be tolerated within a wildcat home range (Klar et al. 2009).  \n\nAs human disturbance descriptors we used, besides the land cover of NNA classes, the \n\nroads length (Road_l) and the elevation Range (Elev_range) that indirectly reflects the \n\nhuman presence. The Non Natural Areas (NNA) integrates the 13 sub-classes of the \n\nArtificial Areas Class of Corine Land Cover 2000. Roads length, correspond to the \n\nlength of highways and main roads in each 10x10 km square at the 1/10000 scale. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 51 \n\nElevation range was obtained from the difference between maximum and minimum of \n\naltitude in each 10x10Km square, using raster data with a geographic accuracy of \n\n1000m (Table 3.1). The data with land use, roads and elevation maps were clipped to \n\n10x10 km UTM grid of Spain.

Considering the Food availability \n\nfundamental to wildcat presence and are present in the 4 hypotheses  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 55 \n\n3.2.4 Data analyses  \n\nBinary logistic regression was performed using the four hypotheses based on food, \n\nhabitat and human disturbance descriptors to model of wildcat occurrence in \n\nContinental Spain and in the Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes. To accomplish that \n\nwas used a training data sets that corresponded to a random subsets (n=2559, 1280 \n\npresences and 1279 absences) (n=2052, 1025 Presences and 1027 absences) and \n\n(n=507, 255 Presences and 252 absences). The variables strongly correlate were \n\nexcluded from the analysis, when rs > 0.7, considering in the selection their correlation \n\nwith wildcat presence and biological meaning. The Regression modelling performed \n\nusing SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 2004) generate 22 models: 6 for Continental Spain and 6 \n\nand 10 for respectively Mediterranean and Atlantic Spain biomes (Table 3.3). Candidate \n\nmodels were then confronted according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to \n\nassess model fit to the distribution data (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Briefly, under \n\nthis approach each hypothesis is represented by one or several competing statistical \n\nmodels which are formulated a priori based on biological knowledge, and AIC provides \n\nan objective tool to rank these models and thus quantify the evidence for each \n\nhypothesis (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  \n\nThe predictive accuracy of the most parsimonious models was evaluated from Receiver \n\nOperating Characteristic (ROC) plots after plotting sensitivity values (true positive \n\nfraction) on the y-axis against their equivalent (1-specificity) values (false positive \n\nfraction) for different thresholds in x (Liu et al. 2005). The AUC measure from ROC \n\ncurve is considered useful for comparing the performance of wildcat presence-absence \n\nmodel in a threshold-independent fashion (Fielding and Bell 1997). The ROC procedure \n\noffers a way of identifying an optimum probability threshold by simply reading the \n\npoint on the curve at witch the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximized (Zweig \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 56 \n\nand Campbell 1993). For this, was examined the model sensitivity (i.e., the probability \n\nof wildcat presence) and the specificity (probability of detecting only absences). \n\n \n\n3.3. RESULTS \n\nModels results (Table 3.4) for Continental Spain and for Mediterranean and Atlantic \n\nSpain biomes revealed that the number of small mammal species and elevation range \n\nhad the highest and positive contribution for wildcat presence in Spain. In Atlantic \n\nbiome elevation range was the most important predictor of wildcat presence. The \n\nimportance of rabbit differed between Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes: it was \n\npositively correlated with wildcat presence in Spain and in the Mediterranean biome but \n\nnot in the Atlantic when considered separately. Vegetation cover had positive (but less \n\nimportant) contribution for wildcat presence in the Continental Spain and in both \n\nbiomes. Mediterranean and Atlantic. Non natural areas contributed negatively in Spain \n\nand Mediterranean areas but were positive in the Atlantic biome. Road length also \n\ncontributed negatively to wildcat presence in Spain but not in Atlantic areas (Figure 3.3 \n\nand Table 3.4). The application of the bests models for Continental Spain and Atlantic \n\nand Mediterranean biomes included tree common variables: Sm_N, Elev_range and \n\nVeg_cover (Table 3.4). In fact, the crosstab (Table 3.5) of best models accuracy in \n\nContinental Spain and the Mediterranean and Atlantic biomes show very similar \n\nperformances. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n 57 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 60 \n\n3.4). The P value that maximized correct prognoses for Continental Spain (68.5%) was \n\n0.46 that correctly classifies presences (75.9%) and absences (61.2%). The same P \n\nvalue maximized the correct prognoses for Mediterranean biome (67.7%) that classifies \n\n75.8% of presences and 59.6% of absences. The P value for the best model for Atlantic \n\nbiome was 0.5 with 77.9% of correct prognoses (79% presences and 76.9% of absences) \n\n(Figure 3.4). The classifications accuracy of the most parsimonious models for \n\nContinental Spain and Mediterranean and Atlantic biomes were then tested in \n\nindependent data samples (i.e. n=1085, 542 Presences and 543 absences \u2013 Spain; \n\nn=982, 491 Presences and 491 absences \u2013 Mediterranean; n=507, 252 Presences and \n\n255 absences \u2013 Atlantic) reserved for model evaluation purposes.

(Figure 3.2 a and b). \n\nIn Mediterranean biome the probabilities shape clearly show a more negative scenario \n\nfor wildcat presence, with the areas of central Spain presenting lowest classes of \n\nprobability (Figure 3.2 d).  For the Atlantic Spain the wildcat occurrence probability \n\nshow high values in all his range with the exception of Galicia region (Figure 3.2 c).  \n\n \n\n3.4. DISCUSSION \n\nA set of models were run in two different biomes, Atlantic and Mediterranean, and in all \n\nContinental Spain using a group of descriptors based on fine scale information. The \n\napproach was to incorporate the advantages of correlative and mechanistic models to \n\ndevelop large-scale determinants that express the local individual requirements for wide \n\nranging species occurring in distinct biomes. To address this, was selected the European \n\nwildcat that has a large geographical range, some ecological tolerance, but suffering a \n\nconstrained in its distribution range (Stahl and Artois 1994). First step was to list all \n\nrelevant information about the species, analyzed identical features between same types \n\nof descriptors and built new predictors. In fact, the mechanistic and correlative models \n\npresents some problems, related with the scale of application, either because of the \n\nlocal/regional species linkage variables changed along biomes and global predictors \n\nhave problems of interpretation (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Johnson and Omland \n\n2004, Helmuth et al. 2005). The success of developed models that incorporates \n\nadvantages of correlative and mechanistic model approaches depends greatly of detailed \n\nbiological information on target species. Nevertheless, large-scale approaches may \n\ndisregard landscape patterns important for regional conservation of the species habitat, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 64 \n\nwhich can be found at fine-scale (Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003). This is particularly for habitat \n\nmodels, once the large-scale don\u2019t reflect the landscape structure features selected at \n\nindividual home range level that high probably correlates with prey resources. The \n\nrelation between fine scale landscape predictors and prey density can be interpreted as a \n\nlikely mechanism to explain habitat quality at a higher level (Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003). \n\nThe inclusion of prey predictors in this model approach revealed the importance of fine \n\nscale landscape features through the weak predictive power of large types of vegetation. \n\nAt large scale model this kind of landscape detailed is not available, so was taken to \n\nincorporate a predictor that relates to main prey resources.  \n\nWhat are the main factors that affect wildcat distribution in Spain using a \u201chybrid\u201d \n\nmechanistic-correlative model approach? \n\nWildcat natural history and behaviour obtained from ecological research at fine scale \n\nsuggests the importance of small mammals as prey for the species, as well the negative \n\ninfluence of human disturbance. In fact, recent study performed at fine scale in south of \n\nPortugal (Monterroso et al. 2009), reveal that that topographic unevenness were also \n\nconsidered key features for wildcat distribution, and with prey availability explained up \n\n85% of species occurrence in the study area (Monterroso et al. 2009). \n\nThe generalized idea that the European wildcat shows different requirements along its \n\ndistribution range, and that these differences are stronger across biomes, mainly \n\nbetween temperate forest and Mediterranean vegetation (Stahl and Artois 1994, McOrist \n\nand Kitchener 1994, Lozano et al. 2003, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004), were not observed at large \n\nscale using information from fine-scale. It is true that, Atlantic areas have a distinct \n\nhabitat composition from Mediterranean biome, the vegetation types are clearly \n\ndifferent, such as the minor extend of agriculture areas, opposed to large extensions of \n\nagriculture fields in Mediterranean. The positive relation of Non natural with wildcat \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 65 \n\npresence in output models of Atlantic biome, in contrast with a negative association of \n\nthis variable in Mediterranean areas; reflect the expression of this descriptor in different \n\nbiomes at large scale. The differences reflect the importance of habitat variables to prey \n\navailability, with the smallest patches of pasture in the Atlantic linkage to rodent \n\navailability and the largest extension of agriculture fields in Mediterranean with the \n\nlower rabbit density. Once the prey availability predictors were included in the model \n\nconstruction the influence of habitat as descriptors of wildcat presence decreased.    \n\nIn fact, the more important descriptors (Sm_N and Elev_range) for wildcat presence in \n\nAtlantic and Mediterranean biomes still occur in Continental Spain. This is the first \n\nlarge scale study that analyses the main wildcat requirements, including prey \n\navailability, vegetation cover and human disturbance, based on regional/local species \n\nknowledge. The inclusion of food resources is a very important step, once these reveal \n\nthe true relation between wildcat and its habitat, as well as species-prey type selection. \n\nApparently the type of vegetation cover is not so important in the distribution of the \n\nwildcat; this is reinforced by the fact that the species is more habitat generalist than first \n\nsuspected, not behaving as strictly forestall (Stahl and Artois 1994, Sarmento 1996, \n\nLozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006). Lozano et al. (2003) refers the relevance of \n\nscrublands for wild-living cats, in particularly the scrub-pastureland mosaic landscape \n\nwere wild rabbits are more abundant, and high shrub cover at a microhabitat scale, \n\nrather than forests at a macro habitat scale. But for a species more generalist in the use \n\nof habitat types, the vegetation predictors many times are linkage to prey availability, \n\nnot reflect the real importance for species occurrence. Klar et al. (2008) refer the \n\nimportance of forest for the wildcat, referring that alone does not fully explain the \n\nspecies habitat use, once the riparian areas within forest, as edge habitats often provide \n\nhigher diversity and abundance of small prey mammals than the interior forest. The \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 66 \n\nrelationship between prey availability and vegetation structure, namely the importance \n\nof pastures \u2013 scrubland mosaics for the wild rabbit in Mediterranean areas of Iberian \n\nPeninsula (Lozano et al. 2003) is a good example how the wildcat presence is indirectly \n\nrelate to vegetation type, as consequence of main prey-vegetation link.  \n\nThe marked Mediterranean areas, dominated by sclerophylous vegetation, are usually  \n\nrelated with a main \u201csingle-key-prey\u201d - wild rabbits (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et \n\nal. 1999, Lozano et al 2006, Monterroso et al. 2009), inversely to Atlantic regions, \n\nmainly covered, by mix and broad leaved forests, in which \u201cgrouped-key-preys \u2013 small \n\nmammals\u201d, are more available. These leads to a fundamental issue, that is the role of \n\nhabitat, nearest related to prey availability and composition, and the main difference \n\nbetween Atlantic and Mediterranean areas, since both vegetation types provide good \n\nconditions for sheltering (Stahl and Artois 1994, Revilla et al. 2001, Lozano et al. 2003, \n\nSarmento et al. 2006). In fact, habitat edges define a transitional line between different \n\ntypes of habitat, particularly relevant when relating to pastures and cover vegetation. \n\nMany rodents, birds and wild rabbits use these ecotones, and they are followed by a \n\ndiversity of predators. Nevertheless, the importance of small mammals for the wildcat, \n\nwell marked in Atlantic areas, still occurs in Mediterranean areas, where these prey \n\nrepresents the most relevant predictor for species occurrence, opposed to the idea of \n\nrabbit specialization in Mediterranean areas. Probably the wildcats take advantage of \n\nlocal wild rabbit\u2019s abundance.  \n\nBesides food and shelters, human disturbance is very important to explain the shape \n\npattern of wildcat occurrence. In fact, the elevation up to a certain range can ensure \n\noptimal conditions for wildcat: low disturbance, food and shelter resources. In the \n\nAtlantic Spain elevation range represents the most relevant descriptor for wildcat \n\npresence, suggesting that these mountains region probably protected the species from \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 67 \n\nthe human activities, these explain the high level of shape probability for wildcat \n\noccurrence in this area. This importance appears reflected in Mediterranean areas where \n\nthe mountains show high probability for species presence. Mermod et al. (2002), \n\nsuggest that the European wildcat in Switzerland uses high elevations in summer for \n\ntwo reasons: they are able to obtain food resources and there are fewer human \n\nsettlements. Alternatively, in some cases this occurrence may result from range \n\ncontractions from human-impacted lower elevation areas leaving remnant populations \n\nin more mountainous regions. Nevertheless, the number and distribution of households \n\nand human settlements can differ from people density. Large villages and cities \n\nconcentring human settlements and highest values of people density, or a dispersal \n\noccupation with lower rates of human population but distributed by a largest area, \n\nrepresents different disturbance scenarios for the wildcat. \n\nWildcat conservation implications \n\nBroad scale predictors of wildcat distribution are essential to address global \n\nconservation strategies, with the ultimate goal of a defined action plan for the species in \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula. The large scale results confirm the variety of habitats used by the \n\nwildcat, and this probably reflects the foraging behaviour on the search for small \n\nmammals and rabbits. Nevertheless, fine scale studies should still be performed; in fact \n\nthe fine scale landscape analysis is very relevant to understand patterns of breeder \n\nabundance, and consequent local habitat management (Vanreusel and Dyck 2007, \n\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003). The conservations measures for the wildcat must promote prey \n\navailability; which is dependent of natural vegetation and low levels of agricultural \n\nintensification. Over decades, in rural areas, people conducted small-scale shrub \n\nclearing by cattle grazing or by facilitating access to exploitation areas, resulting in a \n\nhighly diverse landscape matrix. These landscape mosaics promote prey availability, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula \n \n\n \n\n 68 \n\nspecially rabbits and rodents (Bolger et al. 1997, Lozano et al. 2003). The modern \n\nworld changes in agriculture practices, transforming natural and small diverse \n\nagriculture patches into large monocultures, reduced the prey availability for the \n\nwildcat. The same situation occurs when large amounts of private areas are devoted to \n\nbig game hunting, with a landscape matrix dominated by shrubs and high density on big \n\ngame species, lead to decreasing prey abundance, especially rabbits (Delibes-Mateos et \n\nal. 2008, Lozano et al. 2007). Environmental measures aiming wildcat conservation \n\nhave to focus on the increase of prey, specially rodents and rabbits. Global changes, like \n\nland-use and climate change, could promote the contraction range for rodents species \n\nand irregular oscillations in their populations abundance, especially those with high \n\nlevel of specialization, depending on specific conditions to occur. This will pronounce a \n\nparticular impact for species that have rodents as key-prey; witch is the case of wildcat. \n\nAnother important aspect is the role of human disturbance, still poorly known, but \n\nprobably highly complex, once they reflect direct (persecution) and indirect human-\n\nwildcat interactions (habitat fragmentation, domestic cats hybridization). Understand \n\nthese interactions and the level how they affect the wildcat occurrence is highly priority \n\nin species conservation. The present work can be used as a powerful tool to assess the \n\nconservation value of sites for the wildcat occurrence in Iberia Peninsula and contribute \n\nto effective conservation planning for the species. \n\n \n\n3. 5 REFERENCES \n\nAymerich M (1982) \u00c9tude comparative des r\u00e9gimes alimentaires du lynx pardelle (Lynx \n\npardina Temminck, 1824) et du chat sauvage (Felis silvestris Schreber, 1777) au \n\ncentre de la P\u00e9ninsule Ib\u00e9rique.

There is little information on the \n\nfactors affecting their numbers and space use in natural areas, impairing our ability to design \n\neffective control policies. We describe the patterns of cat presence, abundance and space use \n\nand analyse the associated environmental and human constraints in a well-preserved  \n\nMediterranean natural area with small scattered local farms. We failed in detecting cats in areas \n\naway from human settlements (trapping effort above 4000 trap-nights), while we captured 30 \n\nindividuals near farm houses. We identified a total of 130 cats, all of them in farms still in use \n\nby people (30% of 128 farms). All cats were free-ranging and very wary of people. The main \n\nfactor explaining the presence of cats was the presence of people, while the number of cats per \n\nfarm was mostly affected by the occasional food provisioning with human refuse and the \n\npresence of people. The home ranges of eight radiodiotagged cats were centred at farms. Males \n\nwent furthest during the mating season (3.8 km on average, maximum 6.3 km), using farms as \n\nstepping stones in their mating displacements (2.2 km of maximum inter-farm distance moved). \n\nAll cats showed a strong preference for human settlements, followed by areas at less than 200 m \n\nfrom roads and with a lower slope. In their daily movements cats notably avoided entering areas \n\nwith high fox density.  \n\nSynthesis and applications. Contrary to our expectations, we failed in detecting cats living \n\nindependently of people. The presence, abundance and space use of cats was heavily dependent \n\non human settlements. Any strategy aiming at reducing their numbers in natural areas should \n\nlimit the presence of people and avoid any access to human refuse. The number of individuals \n\nmoving into well preserved areas can be controlled by increasing the distance between \n\nsettlements and by preserving the community of native carnivores. When controlling human \n\npresence is not possible, the alternative would be neutering and vaccinating the cats, especially \n\nmales. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 78 \n\nKey-words: feral cats, Iberian lynx, wildcat, presence and abundance, space use,  movement \n\npatterns, carnivore interactions, invasive species \n\n \n\n4.1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe presence of domestic species in natural areas often represents a conservation \n\nproblem due to competition with and predation of wild species, because they act as \n\nreservoirs for many diseases and even due to the potential hybridization with the wild \n\nancestor types (Gittleman et al. 2001). The domestic cat Felis catus is no exception and \n\nis currently considered a major conservation problem. It is the carnivore species with a \n\nwider distribution range, being present in all continents and in many islands, including \n\nseveral subantartic islands (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986, Matias and Catry 2007, \n\nBergstrom et al. 2009). Cats have accompanied humankind in all phases of exploration \n\nand colonization, and have been accidentally or deliberately introduced to most of the \n\nterrestrial ecosystems of the world (Fitzgerald and Turner 2000). In some cases, they \n\nhave adapted with great success to new environments such as island ecosystems where \n\nthey became a successful invader being today dominant predators that cause a very \n\nrelevant impact on breeding seabird colonies and endemic species (Rensburg and Bester \n\n1988, Nogales et al. 2004). In mainland areas, house cats also have a record as a \n\nsubsidised exotic predator of native species (Woods et al. 2003). In addition to their \n\npredatory impact, domestic cats act as reservoirs in the transmission of numerous \n\ndiseases to other species (Artois and Remond 1994, Daniels et al. 1999). In the case of \n\nthe Iberian lynx, the most endangered feline of the world, the transmission of Feline \n\nImmunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) by domestic cats \n\nmay become a serious threat to their populations (Meli et al. 2009, Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009). \n\nA recent outbreak of FeLV in one of the two surviving Iberian lynx populations resulted \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 79 \n\nin the infection of 13 individuals (24% prevalence) and in the subsequent death of 6 of \n\nthem. The phylogenetic analyses of the virus strains indicated that the infection most \n\nlikely originated from the domestic cats invading the lynx habitats (Meli et al. 2009). In \n\ncontrast to the reservoir role of the domestic cat, FeLV was highly virulent to lynxes. \n\nAnother major problem of free ranging domestic cats is introgressive hybridization with \n\nwildcats Felis silvestris (Randi and Ragni 1991, Hubbard et al. 1992). Extensive \n\nhybridization has been described in Hungary and Scotland, contrasting with occasional \n\ninterbreeding in Italy and Germany (Beaumont et al. 2001, Daniels et al. 2001, \n\nPierpaoli et al. 2003, Oliveira et al. 2008). Much of the hybridizations probably \n\noccurred in areas where the contact between the two species is more common. The \n\nimpact of domestic cats depends on where they can be found and on the factors \n\ncontrolling their numbers and space use. Pet cats are found in large numbers in urban \n\nand suburban areas around the globe. However, the main conservation threats are posed \n\nby cats whose needs are not satisfied by people (at least not intentionally). Stray and \n\nferal cats live and reproduce with little or no human intervention and survive by \n\nscavenging or hunting. The almost unlimited food supplies that cities provide allow for \n\nthe presence of vast numbers of feral cats; for example about 30 million cats are \n\nestimated to live in the streets of the United States (Grimm 2009). The number of feral \n\ncats follows the gradient of availability of human-related food resources form urban and \n\nsuburban to rural areas, where the availability is much lower than in cities. Within this \n\ngradient, cat populations exhibit varying degrees of dependence on humans, and it is \n\ngenerally assumed that feral cats can live and reproduce freely in well preserved natural \n\nareas (Paltridge 2002, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2007). The most dangerous \n\ndomestic cats are precisely those living or expending time in natural areas, where they \n\nhave an easier access to rare or endangered prey, may get in contact with wild \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 80 \n\nendangered carnivores and may interbreed with wildcats. In this paper we investigate \n\nthe factors associated with 92 the presence, abundance and space use by domestic cats \n\nin a gradient between a well-preserved natural area and a rural area with very low \n\nhuman density distributed in isolated farm settlements within a heterogeneous \n\nMediterranean landscape in the South of the Iberian Peninsula. The area is \n\nrepresentative of well preserved Mediterranean habitats where wildcats can still persist \n\nand where reintroduction programs of Iberian lynx are expected to be implemented \n\n(Anonymous 2008). We aim at describing the patterns of occurrence and abundance of \n\ndomestic cats, as well as to evaluate home range, movements and habitat use and the \n\nenvironmental and human constraints associated to them. A priori, we expected that cats \n\nwill be heavily dependent on human-related descriptors for individuals inhabiting near \n\nhuman settlements, while environmental features, such as those describing the \n\navailability of food and/or protection, should become much more relevant for cats living \n\nindependently far from settlements. The information on those human and environmental \n\ndeterminants should prove useful when managing populations of domestic cats in the \n\nmost sensitive natural areas. \n\n \n\n4.2. METHODS \n\n4.2.1. Study area \n\nThe study was carried out in Moura-Barrancos Natura 2000 site (43,309 ha) and part of \n\na Bird Special Protection Area, encompassing the agroforestry areas around the village \n\nof Barrancos in the Southeast Portuguese-Spanish border (between 38\u00ba13\u2019N - 37\u00ba57\u2019N \n\nand 7\u00ba24\u2019O - 6\u00ba59\u2019O, Figure 4.1). This landscape is a typically well-preserved \n\nMediterranean forested area, dominated by holm oak woodlands (Quercus rotundifolia), \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 81 \n\npatches of sclerophylous scrubland and rocky areas and boulders along the main rivers \n\nand streams. Elevation ranges between 200 and 400 m. There are no villages within the \n\nNatura 2000 site and human settlements are reduced to isolated traditional farm houses. \n\nThe climate is characterized by dry and hot summers and cold winters. Human activity \n\nis restricted to cattle rising, traditional agriculture and game hunting in an agro-silvo-\n\npastoral system characterized by a heterogeneous combination of patches with open tree \n\ncover for cattle grazing (montado or dehesa) and shrubby forest patches. Moura-\n\nBarrancos Natura 2000 study site belongs to two municipalities: Barrancos, with a \n\nsingle village occupied by about 1,800 people (with a municipal density of 10.7 \n\ninhabitants/km\u00b2) and Moura, that encompasses five small villages close to the study area \n\n(17.1 inhabitants/km\u00b2). The study area offers a very suitable habitat for wildcats and the \n\ngradient between no human occupation to isolated farm houses offers a landscape \n\ncontext where hybridization between wild and domestic cats might occur. The Natura \n\n2000 site was created, among other reasons, because it was one of the last strongholds \n\nof the Iberian lynx in Portugal (Pires and Fernandes 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Distribution of domestic cats \n\n4.2.2.1 Live-and photo-trapping \n \n\nIn order to estimate the presence of cats we implemented a live-trapping program both \n\nin scrubland areas and at farm houses. In the first case we selected areas with potentially \n\nhigh quality for wildcats in a range of distances to the nearest farm house (with a range \n\nof 1.3 to 4.5 km to the nearest house). Trapping occurred between February and July \n\n2006 and March and July 2007 with 14 box-traps (model 608, Tomahawk Live Trap \n\nCo., Wisconsin, United States of America). Traps were baited with a live pigeon to \n\nmaximise the capture probability of both domestic and wildcats. The pigeon was fed \n\nand protected inside the trap to avoid being captured by cats. We located box-traps in \n\nplaces 140 with thick vegetation or rocky cover, separated by 300-500m of distance. \n\nTraps were checked daily after sunrise. Additionally, we performed two campaigns of \n\nphototrapping in the same areas. In the first site we used nine cameras (Cam TrakkerTM \n\n143 , Watkinswille, GA, USA) from March to May 2006, while in the second area we \n\nused 11 cameras from May to August 2006. Cameras were also baited with a protected \n\npigeon. The trapping campaign at farms occurred in January and May 2007 in 10 farms \n\nwithin our study area. Live trapping was carried out around households using five traps \n\nper farm. Traps were baited with fresh fish and were checked twice a day (sunrise and \n\nsunset). The animals captured were weighted after being anaesthetized with an intra-\n\nmuscular injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitors, Espoo, Finland; \n\n0.1mgmL-1150 ) and ketamine hydrochloride (Imalgenes, Lyon, France; 1 gmL-1151 ) \n\nin a 2:1 proportion. After handling, 0.08 mg/kg of Antisedan was administered for \n\nreversal. The age (young/adult) of animals was estimated from body weight and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 84 \n\ndentition. We considered adults those animals with full adult dentition and a weight \n\nabove 2.5 kg or 3.5kg for females and males respectively (Liberg et al. 2000). \n\n \n\n4.2.2.2 Cat presence and abundance at farms \n \n\nWe identified all farms inside our study area and evaluated the presence and number of \n\ncats during survey visits. We complemented this information with interviews to the \n\nowners/workers to obtain information on their use of the farm, the number and type of \n\nnon seen cats and on their relationship with cats (including food provisioning). We used \n\na ground-validated 1:5,000 orthophoto (year 2005) to build the digital cartography on \n\nland cover. We considered three land cover classes: human settlements, corresponding \n\nto the building areas in farms and other human settlements; natural vegetation, including \n\nsclerophylous vegetation, coniferous forests and riparian vegetation, and agro-forestry \n\nareas, which consisted in the oak montado-dehesas without understory and olive groves \n\n(Table 4.1). Additionally, we used a digital elevation model (DEM) in raster format (10 \n\nm resolution) obtained from a 1: 25,000 vectorial topographic map. Slope was derived \n\nfrom the DEM using second-order finite differences, and ranged from 0 to 41\u00ba. Roads \n\nand rivers were digitised from 1: 250,000 maps, corresponding to the length of paved \n\nroads and main rivers. Environmental and human-related variables were determined \n\nwithin a circle centred at each farm with an area of 1km\u00b2 (Table 4.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 85 \n\n4.2.3. Analyses \n\nWe analysed the environmental and human-related factors affecting the presence of cats \n\nat farms using generalised linear models with a binomial error distribution and a logit \n\nlink function in R software. We considered that two variables were strongly correlated \n\nwhen rs > 0.7, using only the one with a higher correlation with the dependent variable. \n\nIn total we generated 17 a priori models of cat presence at farms based on three groups \n\nof hypotheses depending on the combination of variables: 1) human influence; 2) \n\nenvironmental variables; or 3) a combination of both (Table 4.2). In the case of cat \n\nabundance we used a Poisson distribution with a log link. Following the same procedure \n\nwe generated 16 candidate models (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). We used the Akaike \n\nInformation Criterion (AIC) to rank the models according to their capacity to \n\nparsimoniously describe the data (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 86 \n\nTable 4.1.

Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 87 \n\n \n\n4.2.3.1 Domestic cats space use \n \n\nIn order to describe the patterns of space use and the factors associated 187 with it we \n\nradio tagged eight domestic cats captured at four farms in 2007. All the farms are well \n\npreserved game areas (Figure 4.1): Noudar Castle (NC), which with 980 ha is located \n\ninside the Natural Park; Coutada Frades (CF) with 468 ha and Contenda Forest Area \n\n(CFA) with 5309 ha, and Russianas (RUS) with 1480 ha, both of which are partially \n\ndevoted to grazing. The eight cats (5 males, 3 adults and 2 subadults; 3 adult females) \n\nwere fitted with radio-collars with activity sensors (Telonics model 105, Telonics Inc, \n\nMesa, AZ, USA). We located cats by triangulation using two bearings taken at less than \n\n10 minutes apart to minimize errors caused by animal movements. Only bearings \n\nbetween 60\u00ba and 120\u00ba were accepted. Fixes were calculated by LOCATE with 95% \n\nerror ellipses using length maximum likelihood estimators. We evaluated the location \n\nerror (~64m) during trials when the cats were in known locations inside the farms. The \n\nanimals were located on average 2-3 times per day at any time in the 24h. On average \n\nwe tracked cats for 10 \u00b1 0.7 (\u00b1SD) months, obtaining an average of 176 \u00b1 14.8 fixes per \n\nanimal.  \n\n4.2.3.2 Home range \n \n\nWe estimated the home range utilization distribution of the radio-marked animals using \n\na kernel estimator (kernelUD function, adehabitat package in R software). The \n\nutilization distribution is the bivariate function giving the probability density that an \n\nanimal is found at a given point according to its geographical coordinates. Using this \n\nmodel, the home range can be defined as the minimum area in which an animal has \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 88 \n\nsome specified probability of being located. Individual home ranges were estimated for \n\nthe 95% utilization distributions. \n\n4.2.3.3 Habitat selection \n \n\nWe investigated the habitat use of cats using five covariates which expand in habitat \n\ncategories (Table 4.1). We compared between the habitat used by the tracked cats and \n\nthe habitat available within their home ranges. First we used a compositional analysis to \n\nobtain a rank order of preferences, testing the overall significance of the selection with a \n\nWilks lambda and then building a ranking matrix. Additionally we used the \n\neigenanalysis of selection ratios and the graphical approach developed by Calenge and \n\nDufour (2006) to describe habitat selection. This method undertakes an additive linear \n\npartitioning aiming at maximizing the difference between habitat use and availability in \n\nthe first factorial axes. The habitat types with a selection ratio between 0 and 1 are used \n\nbelow their availability while those above 1 are positively selected. The analyses were \n\ncomputed using the adehabitat package in the R software v.9.1. \n\n \n4.2.3.4 Daily movements \n \n\nWe analysed the environmental and human-related factors affecting the length of the \n\nmovements of the radiomarked cats using the displacements built with one location per \n\nday (we selected the two consecutive locations as close as possible to 24 hours). We \n\nused generalised linear mixed models using the length of the daily displacement as \n\nresponse variable and a group of independent variables related to sampling features \n\n(sex, season) and environmental and human-related factors (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). Each \n\ndisplacement was divided by location error (64 m) in order to standardize the length size \n\nand avoid overdispersion. In this way the analysis will show mostly the determinants of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 89 \n\nlonger displacements. The variables quantifying the percentage of land use classes along \n\nthe displacements were built using a 5 m buffer around each displacement vector (Table \n\n4.1). We included several variables describing the probability of encountering other \n\ncarnivores during the displacement. With this purpose we performed a total of 54 \n\ntransects of 1 km in which we surveyed signs of carnivore presence within the minimum \n\nconvex polygon defined by all the locations of the marked cats. Transects were located \n\nrandomly in areas in which we had entrance granted by landowners, along dirt roads or \n\nfoot-paths facilitating the surveys. We built a kernel utilization distribution for each \n\nspecies using all the signs of presence detected and an additional one for all the species \n\ncombined. We used the number of kernel probability isolines (in 5% increments) \n\ncrossed by cat displacements as a proxy of potential competition between wild \n\ncarnivores and domestic cats (Table 4.1). Again, we removed one independent variable \n\nwhen it showed a strong correlation with other one, retaining the one with the higher \n\ncorrelation with the dependent variable. We used a code identifying each individual as a \n\nrandom factor in all models, obtaining a total of 22 a priori models according to the \n\npotential factors that could affect the displacements (Table 4.2). Models were run using \n\nLme4 package in R software v.2.9.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 91 \n\nMartes foina. At the same site, we obtained a total of 498 photos with a total effort of \n\n612 trap-nights. Considering only one capture per day and camera we photo-captured 15 \n\nwildboars Sus scrofa, 13 red foxes, eight badgers, eight genets, seven mongooses and \n\nfour stone martens. Similarly, at the Southern site, with an effort of 1117 trap-nights, we \n\nlive captured 12 red foxes, five mongooses, three badgers, two genets, and two stone \n\nmartens. Photo-trapping provided a total of  photos with a total effort of 814 trap-nights, \n\nincluding 22 red deer Cervus elaphus, eight wildboars, nine foxes, eight genets, seven \n\nmongooses, five badgers, and two stone martens. On the contrary, at the ten farms \n\nwhere we carried out a total trapping effort of 297 trap nights we captured 30 different \n\ncats: 12 males (of which eight were adults) and 18 females (12 adults).  \n\n4.3.1.1 Cats presence and abundance at farms \n\nIn total we identified 128 farms within our study area of which 86 (67.2%) had no \n\nresident people. Many of them were abandoned or even in ruins. There were no cats in \n\nthe abandoned houses. The average distance to the nearest house was 1.1 \u00b1 5.51 km. \n\nThe 42 farms in use (32.8%) give a density of 0.09 farms km-2. Cats were present in 39 \n\nof them (92.5%), with a total of 130 individuals (3.3 \u00b1 1.85 cats per farm) and a density \n\nof 0.26 cats km-2 274 (this density excludes the area of the village of Barrancos and a \n\nbuffer of 3 km around). The sex ratio of 88 individuals (29 males, 59 females) was \n\n1M:2F but for the remaining 41 individuals sex was unknown. The average nearest \n\ndistance between farms with cats was 2.7 \u00b1 12.7 km. Farm owners or residents \n\nconsidered all cats to be free ranging i.e., they were no kept as pets. In none of the farms \n\nthe cats received veterinary support. Food provisioning was never provided on a regular \n\nbasis, with 33 farms feeding cats only sporadically with human refuse (84.6 % of the \n\noccupied houses). Except for one cat out of the 130, farm owners defined them as very \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 92 \n\nwary (cannot be captured by hand, fleeing when approached). The best model \n\ndescribing the presence of domestic cats in farms included the presence of people and \n\nthe length of roads and rivers around the farm (explained 30.5% of the deviance); the \n\nnext best model included only the first two variables (models A8 and A17, Table 4.2). \n\nThe most important predictor of cat presence was the occupation of farms by people, \n\naccounting for 90.6% of the deviance explained by the best model (Table 4.3). The \n\nother two predictors are also associated to the farms that are more intensively used by \n\npeople, either because they are better communicated (road length) or because the area is \n\nmore suitable for small-scale traditional agriculture (river length). These results go \n\nagainst our initial expectation that presence of cats in natural sites far from urban, \n\nsuburban and rural areas would rely more heavily on environmental than on human-\n\nrelated variables. In the analysis of the variables that influence the number of domestic \n\ncats all models with the highest support included food supplementation by people and \n\nthe presence of people (Table 4.2). The most supported model (B8, Table 4.2) also \n\nincluded the mean slope around the farm, which had a negative effect (Table 4.3). \n\nTogether the two human related variables explain 83.2% of model deviance, with partial \n\ncontributions of 45.1% and 38.2%, respectively for cats_feed and people. As in the \n\nanalysis of cat presence, human factors seem to have the greatest influence in the \n\nnumber of cats per household farm, while environmental factors are probably linked to \n\nfarm location.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

All individual home ranges included the farm where \n\neach cat was captured (Figure 4.1). The average of the maximum distance between the \n\ncapture site  (farm) and the furthest radio location was 2.9\u00b11.8 km, ranging between 1.2 \n\nand 6.3 km. Male home range sizes were larger than those of females, with 430 ha \n\n(range 71 - 1476) and 87 ha (41 \u2013 113), respectively. There was a substantial inter-\n\nsexual home range overlap (Figure 4.1). Home ranges were centred in farm buildings, \n\nbut in some occasions males moved away to another farm or to the village. In fact, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 94 \n\nfurthest distances away from the farm belong to males during the mating season \n\n(autumn-winter), on average 3.8 \u00b1 2.2 km (with a maximum of 6.4 km) vs 1.6 \u00b1 0.7 km \n\nout of the mating season; for females the average furthest distance was 1.2 for both \n\nseasons (\u00b1 0.4 and \u00b1 0.3, respectively). The maximum distances that males travelled are \n\nassociated to the distance to the nearest farm with cats (r2 = 0.67) only during the \n\nmating season (r2 = 0.0 outside the season). Males used farms as stepping stones in their \n\nmating displacements; the maximum inter-farm distance moved was 2.2 km while the \n\nmale that never made any excursion to other farm was 3.4 km away from the nearest \n\noccupied farm. None of the females moved between farms. \n\n4.3.2.2 Habitat selection \n \n\nThe radio-tracked cats did not use the habitat within their home ranges at random (? = \n\n0.0122, P = 0.0080). The compositional analysis showed that there was a clear \n\npreference order headed by human settlements (House), followed by areas at less than \n\n200 m from roads and with a smaller slope (Table 4.4). Steep areas, far from roads and \n\ncovered with natural vegetation were the less preferred (Table 4.4). The eigenanalysis of \n\nselection ratios confirmed those clear preferences. The results for the first two axes \n\nexplain 93.3 % of the information (74.4 % for the first axis and 18.1 % for the second, \n\nFigure 4.2 in Supporting Information). House was the land-use type more used by cats; \n\nin fact seven of the eight individuals made it their first choice as shown by the highest \n\nselection ratios (Table 4.4). The selection ratios for the remaining habitats show that \n\nhuman settlements play an important role because cats spent most of their time in the \n\nareas around the houses, i.e, close to roads and with low slope (Table 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 96 \n\n4.3.2.3 Daily movements \n \n\nWe obtained a total of 339 daily displacements with a mean length of 605 \u00b1 743 m, and \n\nan average time span of 20 \u00b1 8 hours. The results of the linear mixed model showed that \n\nsex did not affect the daily displacements and that season only appeared in 3 of the 7 \n\nmodels with wAIC>0.05 (Table 4.2). Environmental variables seem to be very relevant \n\nin explaining the length of the daily displacements. In fact, the most supported model \n\nincludes the average number of red fox 5% kernel isolines crossed, the elevation range, \n\nthe number of roads and rivers crossed and the number of patches of natural vegetation \n\ncrossed. The most important variable in all models was the proxy for red fox encounter \n\nprobability, having a strong negative effect on daily displacement (Table 4.3). The \n\npositive effects of elevation range and number of roads and rivers crossed probably \n\nrepresents the differences in elevation when the animals moved far away from farms, \n\nsince the households where we marked the cats are located at elevated places, and the \n\nfurther they moved away, the more probable it was that they crossed a road or a river. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nInitially we expected to find cats living in a range of densities following the gradient of \n\nhuman occupation of the landscape. We also expected that cats living in natural areas \n\nfar away from human settlements and living independently of people, i.e. relying on \n\nnatural resources, should be more affected by environmental variables. However, we \n\nwere unable to detect cats living freely far away from people. Our trapping effort was \n\nlarge enough to assume that in our natural area there were no cats living independently \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 97 \n\nof people. The presence and number of cats was dependent on the presence of people \n\nand the resources they provide. In fact, the area around buildings was the preferred land \n\nuse type for cats, as confirmed by the highest value of selection ratios. Many of the \n\nfarms were abandoned along the past century, when human density in natural areas was \n\nhigher. At the maximum of farm occupation cat density was probably much higher than \n\nnowadays (three times higher assuming the same distribution of cats per farm). \n\nNowadays, the reduced pressure of domestic cats in Mediterranean natural areas can be \n\nrelevant for the conservation of wildcats and Iberian lynx. Cats do not live far away \n\nfrom people in our area. However, it is generally assumed that feral cats can live \n\nindependently of people in well preserved natural areas, as demonstrated by studies in \n\nsome islands and in Australia (eg. Rensburg and Bester 1988, Paltridge 2002, Phillips et \n\nal. 2007). The evidence for other areas is very poor. In Scotland, Daniels et al. (2001) \n\nfound that their putative wildcats were in contact with farm cats; in a natural area of \n\nHungary the marked feral cats were close to farms, and their home ranges were at less \n\nthan 2 km from one city and a village (Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004); and in northern France, \n\ndomestic cats centred their home ranges in a village or around farms (Germain et al. \n\n2008). Studies on feral cats are commonly located in urban and suburban areas (eg. \n\nBarrat 1997, Say and Pontier 2004) and even in inhabited small islands feral cats tend to \n\nrely on people (Yamane et al. 1996). It is therefore clear that high human density \n\nsupports higher cat densities in natural or semi-natural areas, linking the expansion \n\nsuccess of cats to different levels of human occupation. It remains to be explained how \n\nferal cats can live in islands on their own. We all have seen domestic cats roaming in \n\nnatural areas far away from any human settlement. Cat home ranges are centred on \n\nfarms, but males can make long displacements in search of females during the mating \n\nseason (see also Barratt 1997, Germain et al. 2008). In fact, female distribution and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 98 \n\ndensity is the primary factor determining male range size (Liberg et al. 2000), as \n\ndemonstrated by the relation between the maximum distance travelled in a season and \n\nthe distance to the nearest farm with females. The furthest excursion by a male was 6 \n\nkm away, but in this case the cat was using several farms as stepping stones. There \n\nseems to be a 3 km distance threshold between farms above which males cannot connect \n\nthem. Germain, Benhamou and Poulle (2008) detected one male mating excursion \n\nbetween farms separated by 2.5 km. In summary, in natural areas cats can live strictly \n\ndepending on only wild resources, as in some deserted islands, but the general pattern is \n\nthat they do not, and they have the capacity to move long distances away from \n\nhouseholds, but they restrict their movements to the vicinity of human settlements. Like \n\nin islands, cats living in farms do not compete with other carnivores, but unlike the \n\nconfined environment of islands, in many mainland areas they have to share space with \n\nother predators when moving away from houses. Our interpretation is that the \n\ndifferences in presence, abundance and movements of cats in natural areas of islands \n\nand mainland are also mediated by the presence and abundance of competing predators. \n\nOur results on the daily movements of cats show that they strongly avoided entering the \n\nareas with higher red fox density. In a study in New South Wales, after fox removal cats \n\nshowed a significant resource shift, suggesting a strong interspecific competition \n\nmediated by both exploitation and interference (Molsher 1999). Foxes prey on cats and \n\ntheir kittens and cat remains have also been observed in fox diet samples in Europe and \n\nAustralia (Fuchs 1972, Martin et al. 1996, Risbey et al. 1999).During our study all \n\nkittens from one female in Noudar Castle were predated by an Egyptian mongoose. In \n\nsummary, feral or free ranging cats are more likely to be rare or absent in regions with \n\nwell preserved wild predator populations. However, in areas with no other predator, \n\nsuch as many islands, or weak predator communities, such as humanized areas, feral \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas \n \n\n 99 \n\ncats may become the dominant predator and often exist at much higher densities than \n\nnative predators. Our study provides a clear linkage between the distribution, numbers \n\nand movements of cats and several human and environmental factors that can be \n\nmanaged to reduce the pressure of domestic cats into natural areas. The presence of \n\npeople is the first most important variable to be managed. The existence of small \n\nsettlements or even isolated houses or farms represents a bridge allowing the intrusion \n\nof cats into the surrounding areas. The key here are those occupied by people and \n\nlocated in well preserved natural areas where we can find other species of conservation \n\nconcern. The distance between houses is another key element that should be controlled \n\nsince cats use them as stepping stones when moving. Even when residents do not own \n\npet cats and do not directly provide food, there is a clear effect on cat presence. If we \n\ncannot manage the presence of people living in the field, in order to maintain low cat \n\nnumbers, food provisioning should be banned while the access of cats to human refuse \n\nmust be controlled. In the worst case scenario in which people is living in a network of \n\nwell connected settlements and provisioning cats with food, males should be neuter to \n\nreduce the distances they move away from houses and to reduce the probability of \n\nhybridization, while veterinary support should be provided to reduce the prevalence of \n\ndiseases in the population of domestic cats. In addition to these measures, an effective \n\nstrategy for controlling hybridization and the transmission of diseases to other species \n\ninvolves maintaining the community of native predators, including red foxes. Finally, \n\nbecause private landowners are the ultimate controllers of their land, providing them \n\nwith information is essential to increase the awareness of people before the \n\nimplementation of any measure. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Historical differences in human association with \n\ndomestic cats and the wildcat Felis silvestris possibly reflect distinct foraging behaviours. A \n\ntotal of 407 scats were collected from nine latrine sites located in southeast Portugal. A random \n\nsample of field-collected scats of each latrine site was genetically analysed to ascertain their \n\norigin as genus Felis individuals. To further obtain an overview of domestic cat diet along its \n\ndistribution range we analysed 57 studies, published since the forties, which report information \n\non the species food regime in different places of the world. Human refuse was the most frequent \n\nitem (76.05%) in scats collected from latrines located near the houses and rabbits (71.43%) were \n\nmore frequent in scats found far from houses. Multivariate analysis confirmed the separation of \n\ntwo groups of scats based on prey items differentiation, near and far from houses. In a global \n\nevaluation of domestic cats\u2019 diet, mammals revealed as the most important food item, and \n\nsimilarities were found between urban and natural areas, as opposed to findings in insular \n\npopulations. Diet of the domestic cat expresses its dependence on people, even in natural areas, \n\nwhere prey diversity and availability is higher. Clear separation of scats collected in latrines \n\nnear houses and those found far from human settlements and located in natural areas, typically \n\nassociates with domestic and wildcats, respectively. To decrease domestic cats abundance in \n\nrural-natural areas of Iberian Peninsula, thus contribution to wildcat conservation, is crucial to \n\nlimit food sources provided, directly or indirectly, by man.  \n\nKeywords: domestic feral cats, wildcats, people and cats distribution, food regimes, \n\nconservation \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 106 \n\n \n\n5.1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe domestic cat Felis catus may be the most widespread predator in the world. Cats \n\nwith dependable food sources are not, as other carnivores, vulnerable to changes in prey \n\npopulations (Fitzgerald 1988). Moreover, unlike many native predators, domestic cats \n\nare not strictly territorial. As a result, cats can exist at much higher densities and may \n\nout-compete native predators for food (Bradshaw et al. 1996). Studies on the feeding \n\nhabits of free-roaming domestic cats, conducted over the last decades in Europe, North \n\nAmerica, Australia, Africa, and many islands, show that they prey on local wildlife, \n\nespecially in \u201cislands\u201d habitats such as suburban and urban parks, and other areas \n\nsurrounded by human development. In addition, it is in these habitats where the cats \n\nhave more success as an opportunistic carnivore, preying on a vast range species and \n\neating a wide variety of resources, revealing its versatility and unusual ability to utilize \n\na broad spectrum of prey types and sizes (Pearre and Maass 1998). \n\nThe largest number of studies regards places where the species represents a serious \n\nconservation problem, such as in islands, urban environments and Australia (Barrat \n\n1997, Arnaud et al 1993, Dowding and Murphy 2001). Since mid-nineties ~ 70 studies \n\nwere carried out on the diet of domestic cat, but only 6 relate to Europe mainland \n\nnatural/rural areas, inside European wildcat Felis silvestris distribution range. \n\nMoreover, assumptions on domestic cat vs European wildcat competition by food \n\nresources are rarely discussed (Daniels et al. 2001, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2005) and only two \n\nstudies compare species diet (Corbett 1979, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2005). However, to establish an \n\neffective wildcat conservation strategy, knowing that its relations with domestic cat may \n\npose a serious conservation problem, we have to concentrate in species interactions, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 107 \n\nincluding the hypothesis of a possible trophic niche overlap as emphasided already by. \n\nCorbett (1979) and Bir\u00f3 (2005). \n\nRegarding food requirements, wildcats consume a large diversity of prey but small \n\nmammals are the stapple prey in most areas of its distribution range (Cond\u00e9 et al. 1972, \n\nSl\u00e1dek, 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Mole\u00f3n and Gil-S\u00e1nchez 2003, Carvalho \n\nand Gomes, 2004). However, these are replaced by wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus \n\nin most of the Mediterranean environments, such as the central and southern regions of \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et al. 1999, Lozano et al 2006). \n\nFor domestic-cats to establish feral populations in natural areas, it is necessary that they \n\nare able to feed exclusively on natural prey, like wildcats. In rural areas, however, \n\nhumans provide domestic cats maintenance resources that other predators do not receive \n\n(Coleman and Temple, 1993). As a result, they may exist in higher densities and exert a \n\ngreater predatory effect than natural predators. Also, cats are opportunistic predators \n\nComan and Brunner, 1972), both in terms of time and space (Barratt, 1997), meaning \n\nthey will depredate whatever prey item they encounter. However, most studies link the \n\nsuccess of cats\u2019 predation on wildlife to places where they have a surplus of food \n\nprovided directly or indirectly by people, or to areas where they not co-evolved with \n\nprey species, like in islands. Besides that, the presence (or absence) of other carnivore \n\nspecies must be taken into consideration when analysing the effects of domestic cats in \n\nwildlife, wildcats included. The disappearance of larger carnivores from a region can \n\nlead to what is known as \u201cmesopredator release\u201d (Fitzgerald 1988), in which the cats are \n\nfree to roam freely and fill the ecological niche left by the first preying on smaller wild \n\nvertebrates. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 108 \n\nTo understand man\u2019s role on the survival of domestic cats in low humanised natural \n\nareas we used the information on scat contents from nine latrine-sites and analysed it \n\nrelatively to distance from human settlements. Three hypotheses were upfront defined: \n\n1) In natural areas domestic cats feed on wild prey and are not dependent on \n\nresources made available by humans; \n\n2) Domestic cats do not roam and feed far from farm houses; \n\n3) Latrines found in the middle of scrubland-woodland habitat patches, far from \n\nfarm houses, are wildcat-originated; \n\nTo test these, we investigated if the worldwide food regime of domestic cats reveal any \n\npattern that can be comparable to the scat results found at the fine scale (study area), \n\ne.g. is domestic cat regime prey-based as like rodents and rabbits in the wildcat diet. In \n\naddition, in areas where it is associated with man, as in urban areas, the basis of their \n\ndiet is the resources provided by man. Moreover, in species so close is to be expected \n\nthat in natural environments, with low human presence, occurs a feeding niche overlap.  \n\nDespite the very tenuous morphological differences between the two species, that can \n\nlead to trophic niche overlap, the historical domestic cat - human association determines \n\ndifferent eating behaviours. In terms of wildcat conservation, to know the food regime \n\nof domestic cats in natural areas is a key issue.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 109 \n\n \n\n5.2 METHODS \n\n5.2.1Study Area \n\nThe study was carried out in Guadiana river basin, that includes Moura-Barrancos \n\nNatura 2000 site (43,309 ha) and part of a Bird Special Protection Area, encompassing \n\nthe agroforestry areas around the village of Barrancos in the Southeast Portuguese-\n\nSpanish border (between 38\u00ba13\u2019N - 37\u00ba57\u2019N and 7\u00ba24\u2019O - 6\u00ba59\u2019O, Fig. 5.1), and is \n\ninhabited by species of carnivores with high conservation value. Moura-Barrancos \n\nNatura 2000 site belongs to two municipalities: Barrancos, with a single village \n\noccupied by about 1,800 people (resulting in a municipal density of 10.7 \n\ninhabitants/km\u00b2) and Moura, that encompasses five small villages close to the study \n\narea (overall municipal density is 17.1 inhabitants/km\u00b2). Human settlements are \n\nrepresented by traditional farm houses scattered throughout the landscape, which offers \n\na very suitable habitat for wildcats and contacts with domestic cats and other carnivore \n\nspecies might occur. The region is characterized by a highly fragmented and complex \n\nlandscape structure, dominated by holm oak Quercus ilex and scrublands-woodlands, \n\nwhere three main rural activities are pursued simultaneously in a single space (livestock \n\nhusbandry, agriculture and hunting). Interspersed with the major forestry type, there are \n\nagricultural fields (cereal, vegetables and olives) and forest plantations (eucalyptus and \n\npines). A large range of temperatures, with mild winters and hot summers, characterizes \n\nthe climate of this region. Precipitation levels are between 400-600mm per year, with \n\naverage temperatures&lt;18\u00baC in the coldest months and >22\u00baC in the warmest months \n\n(Ch\u00edcharo et al. 2001). Water is concentrated in rivers, streams and creeks, which have \n\nan intermittent regime. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 110 \n\nFigure 5.1. Study area. The buffer of 1 km, in each latrine, represents the maximum distance \n\ntravelled by domestic cats in the study area (Ferreira et al. submitted - Paper II of this thesis).   \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Cats diet in the study area \n\nThe diet of cats was investigated through the analysis of scats, routinely collected from \n\nlatrines sites. A total of 407 scats originated from nine latrine sites, six monitored during \n\n2002 (N=173 scats) and three in 2007 (N=234). A random sample of field-collected \n\nscats of each latrine site was genetically analysed to ascertain that they were from \n\nindividuals of the genus Felis, using a recently developed protocol with species-specific \n\nmitochondrial DNA markers for Iberian carnivores (Fernandes et al 2008). Distance \n\nbetween each latrine and the nearest human settlements was assessed using a 1km \n\nbuffer around the latrine centre.. Three main groups were defined: i) the latrine was \n\nlocated in the middle of houses, ii) the latrine buffer included houses inside, and iii) the \n\nlatrine buffer did not included any house. Then, each scat was analysed as a single \n\nsample. For the analysis, scats were immersed in water and all remains examined to \n\nseparate bone fragments, teeth, hair, feathers, insect pieces, or other prey remains. The \n\nprey items categories considered in the analysis were rabbits, rodents, other small \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 111 \n\nmammals, ungulates, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, other invertebrates and human \n\nrefuse. Rodents and insectivores were identified to species level from their teeth \n\n(Santero and Alvarez, 1985) and hair (Teerink, 1991). As reported in most carnivore \n\nstudies, results were expressed as the frequency of occurrence (FO) of the different prey \n\nitems (Reynolds and Aebischer, 1991). To investigate if resources consumption was, \n\ndirectly or indirectly, associated with human presence, in opposition to the wild-prey \n\nbased diet of wild carnivores such as wildcats, a linear discriminant analysis was \n\nperformed using the three categories of latrine sites above described and a total of 18 \n\nfood resources categories: rabbitsD (rabbits in dry season), aposylD (wood mouse in dry \n\nseason), musD (Mus sp. in dry season), passeD (passeriformes in dry season), alerufD \n\n(red-legged-partridge in dry season), repteilsD (reptiles in dry season), insectsD (insects \n\nin dry season), crayfishD (crayfish in dry season), human_refuseD (human refuse in dry \n\nseason), rabbitsW (rabbits in wet season), aposylW (wood mouse in wet season), musW \n\n(Mus sp. in wet season), passeW (passeriformes in wet season), alerufW (red-legged-\n\npartridge in wet season), repteilsW (reptiles in wet season), insectsW (insects in wet \n\nseason), crayfishW (crayfish in wet season) and human_refuseW (human refuse in wet \n\nseason). All items resulting in small samples sizes (n &lt;20) were excluded from \n\nstatistical analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis was also used in order to generate \n\ngroups of scats based on the complete dataset (N=407). For pairs of correlated variables \n\nthe one less significant to the dependent variable was excluded from further analysis. To \n\ntest the null hypothesis of no significant difference in the mean of the dependent \n\nvariable for the different groups (cluster plots), formed by categories of the explanatory \n\nvariables (prey items), a multivariate analysis of variance \u2013 MANOVA, was performed. \n\nSignificant differences resulting from multivariate analysis were examined with \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 112 \n\nunivariate F tests at the variable level to allow interpretation of the respective effect. \n\nStatistical analysis were performed with MASS package of R software. \n\n5.2.3 Domestic cat diet in the world \n\nFor the overview of domestic cat diet along the distribution range we analysed fifty \n\nseven studies published since the forties that report information about the species food \n\nregime around the world (Table 5.1). To homogenize the sample and allow results \n\ncomparison from different geographical areas we used some exclusion criteria from the \n\nsample: studies with small samples sizes (n &lt;30) and data refering to a single season. \n\nFew other had also to be excluded, either because data was obtained by inquiries to cats\u2019 \n\nowners (Woods et al. 2003, Baker et al. 2005) or FO values could not be estimated \n\n(Barrat 1997, Giles and Clout 2003). Prey types were rearranged to homogenize the data \n\nfor comparative purposes, and FO was calculated when necessary. Seven prey items \n\nwere considered: Rabbits, Rodents, Other Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Invertebrates and \n\nHuman Refuse. Thirty one studies (54.3%) refer to insular habitats, sixteen (28.2%) to \n\nnatural/rural areas and ten (17.5%) to urban areas. Of the studies referring to \n\nnatural/rural areas, only four respect to areas out of Australia. The frequency of \n\noccurrence was the commonest measure made available by authors and was considered \n\nvalid for comparative purposes (Reynolds and Aebischer, 1991). The prey items \n\nreported in the literature were collected and tabulated separately for each study. In some \n\nstudies the food obtained by scavenging, or household is referred but data on the \n\nfrequency of consumption is not available (Rodr\u00edguez-Moreno et al. 2007, Campos et \n\nal. 2007). Data compiled per study were: (i) type of food consumed (species and/or \n\ncategories); (ii) frequency of occurrence [FO = (number of scats or gut samples with a \n\nparticular item x 100)/(total number of scats or gut samples)]; (iii) number of carnivore \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 113 \n\nspecies (> 2kg) that occurs in each study area. A linear discriminant analysis was \n\nperformed using the data set of the 57 worldwide studies, classified as either to three \n\ntypes of areas: Islands, Urban or Natural area. To test the null hypothesis of no \n\nsignificant difference in the mean of the dependent variable for the different groups \n\n(cluster plots), formed by categories of the explanatory variables (prey items), a \n\nmultivariate analysis of variance \u2013 MANOVA, was performed.

Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 118 \n\n \n\n5.3 RESULTS \n\n5.3.1Cats diet in the study area \n\nThe results of scat contents from latrines sites near and far from houses are summarised \n\nin table 5.2. Scats collected far from natural areas contained in average 1.44 different \n\nfood items, while those near houses had 1.63. Human refuse was the most frequent item \n\n(76.05%) in scats collected at latrines close to houses but was absent in scats collected \n\nin latrines away from houses. Inversely, rabbits (71.43%) were the most consumed \n\nresource in scats found far from houses, showing little relevance (3.36%) in scats \n\ncollected in latrines near human settlements. Rodents were the main vertebrate (58.8%) \n\nfound in scats near the houses, with Mus sp (probably the house mouse \u2013 Mus \n\ndomesticus) dominating (37.81%). This result contrasts with rodents\u2019 frequency of \n\noccurrence (17.14%), in particular that of Mus sp. (4.0%), detected in scats collected in \n\nnatural areas away from houses. The wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, on the contrary, \n\nwas most consumed (9.71%) in areas away from houses (3.28% in scats near houses). \n\nThese differences in the consumption of house and wood mice relate to the preferred \n\nhabitats of each species, with the house mouse being associated to humanized \n\nenvironments and the wood mouse to bushes and forested areas (Blanco 1998). A fact to \n\nbe emphasised was the occurrence of wild carnivores remains (two of common genets \n\nGeneta geneta and one of stone marten Martes foina) in scats collected at latrines \n\nplaced far from human settlements. Birds, like insects, occurred in similar frequency in \n\nthe scats collected at the latrine groups, near and far from houses. Reptiles were clearly \n\nmore frequent (13.14% vs. 2.94%) in scats far from houses, and amphibians and \n\ncrayfish, were only found in the scats collected far from households.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The \n\nsecond item that appears more times with the biggest FO, in islands, were birds \n\n(22.3%). In Natural areas were rodents, human refuse and insects (11.4% each) and \n\ninvertebrates (30.4%) in urban places. Nevertheless, birds are the most frequent item \n\n(number of areas where the item occurred) in world cats diet in islands (100%) and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 124 \n\nnatural areas (94.1%), and human refuse (100%) in urban places, followed by rodents in \n\nIslands (74.2%) and birds in urban places (90%), substitute by insects in natural areas \n\n(76.4%). The consumption of rabbits is more frequent in islands (48.4%) and natural \n\nareas (64.7%), alike human refuse in urban places (100%) and in natural areas (53.3%). \n\nThe studies revealed that cats consumed in average 4.8 \u00b1 1.8 (\u00b1SD) resource types (of a \n\nmaximum of seven categories considered) in islands, 4.6 \u00b1 1.7 items in urban places and \n\n5.1 \u00b1 1.4 in natural areas. A significant relationship was found between the number of \n\nprey items and rabbits consumption in islands (r2 = 0.406, F1,29=21.54, P<0.001) and \n\nnatural areas (r2 = 0.330, F1,15=8.89, P<0.01). The same was found for human refuse in \n\nislands (r2 = 0.360, F1,29=17.92, P<0.001), but not in urban places (r\n2 = -0.122, \n\nF1,8=0.02, P=0.89) and natural areas (r\n2 = 0.161, F1,15=4.08, P=0.07). Using all the \n\nstudies as a unique dataset, a significant relationship was obtained between the number \n\nof prey items and the consumption of human refuse (r2 = 0.201, F1,56=15.39, P<0.001) \n\nand rabbits (r2 = 0.373, F1,56=34.98, P<0.001).  \n\nFigure 5.4, that illustrates the linear discriminant analysis for the three groups of studies, \n\nshows a greater similarity between domestic cat diet in urban and natural areas, \n\nrelatively to the islands. The prior probability of each group is 59.0% for islands, 29.5% \n\nfor natural areas and 11.4% for urban places. The first linear discriminant function \n\nexplains 71.4% of all variability, with the greatest contributions from the partial \n\ncoefficients of human refuse (0.0481) and birds (-0.0129), while reptiles (-0.0487) and \n\nrodent (0.0219) consumption contributes most for the second discrimant function that \n\nexplains 28.6% of variability (Table 5.3b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 126 \n\nThe hierarchical cluster analysis first separated two groups (A: 52.3%  and B: 47.7% of \n\nall studies), with greater representation of studies made in natural (25.8%) and urban \n\n(22.5%) areas in group A (decreasing in group B to 17.6 % and 11.7%, respectively), \n\nwhile those relating to islands were mostly included (70.5%) in group B (Figure 5.5). At \n\nthe second hierarchical level, three groups are evident (group A and two new resulting \n\nfrom the sub-division of plot B (B1: 53% and B2: 47%, respectively). Studies in islands \n\nrepresent 77.7% of the dataset of B1, and natural areas 50% of those in B2. Urban places \n\nhad a smaller and similar representation in both groups (11.1% in B1 and 12.5% in B2). \n\nThe MANOVA show significant main effects between groups A and B (Pillai-Bartlett \n\nTrace=0.840, F1,59=39.83, P &lt;0.001) with a significant contribution of mammals \n\n(F1,59=270.09, P &lt;0.001), rabbits (F1,59=8.38, P &lt;0.01) and reptiles (F1,59=6.03, P &lt;\n\n0.05). Significant effects were also found between the three groups formed at the second \n\nhierarchical level (Pillai-Bartlett Trace=0.871, F1,59=51.03, P &lt;0.001), having as \n\nassociated explanatory variables the mammals (F1,59=199.96, P &lt;0.001), rabbits \n\n(F1,59=37.29, P &lt;0.001), birds (F1,59=5.15, P &lt;0.05) and reptiles (F1,59=6.38, P &lt;0.05).  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4 DISCUSSION \n\nThe results lead to the exclusion of hypothesis 1, has it appears to be a clear \n\ndifferentiation between prey items from latrine groups, according to its distance from \n\nhouses. This is reinforced by the pattern of trophic regime of domestic cat in the world \n\nwhere there are similarities between urban and natural areas, as opposed to the islands. \n\nThat is, the diet of the domestic cat expresses its dependence to people, even in natural \n\nareas, where the diversity and prey availability is higher. So, we can say that the results \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 127 \n\nbest fit hypotheses 2 and 3. In fact, feeding data resulting from scats collected away \n\nfrom homes are in accordance with the trophic regime described for the wildcat (Lozano \n\net al. 2006) and that resulting from scats found near houses are close  to those \n\ndescribing domestic cat diet in worldwide studies. Nevertheless, a group of latrines that \n\nwas not located near the human settlements, but included houses in the 1km buffer, did \n\nnot show a relation with any of the two other groups, probably because they didn\u2019t had a \n\nstrong influence of the most significant items, rabbits and human refuse. The \n\nimportance of human refuse for the group of latrines located near the houses, is \n\nreinforces by the fact that a study in the same area showed an association between \n\ndomestic cat distribution and human presence, and their abundance with the food \n\nresources provided by humans (Ferreira et al. submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). A \n\nsuccess strategy to reduce feral cats in natural areas is to limit their access to human \n\nrefuses, once this will have effect on their distribution and density (Ferreira et al. \n\nsubmitted - Paper II of this Thesis). \n\nThe results of the fine scale study (study area level) revealed that Felis sp. scats \n\ncollected from latrines sites at different spatial influence of human settlements, revealed \n\ntwo important food items, rabbits and human refuse, with the presence of the first \n\nassociated to scats collected in natural areas and the later from latrines near houses. \n\nAlso, differences were found in the specific composition of rodents consumed by cats \n\nusing latrines sites near and far from human settlements. The gender Mus sp., most \n\nprobably the house mouse, was the species with highest occurrence in scats collected at \n\nlatrine sites near houses, while the wood mouse was most found in those located in \n\nundisturbed natural areas. Bir\u00f3 (2005) analysed the wildcat-feral domestic cat food \n\nregime in Hungary and found that no human-related prey items occurred in the diet of \n\nthe wildcat but were preyed by feral cats. The results from the worldwide overview on \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 128 \n\ncats diet are in accordance with thouse found by Liberg (1984), Fitzgerald (1988) and \n\nBir\u00f3 et al. (2005), in which feral domestic cats are described as generalist and \n\nopportunist species. Wildcats, on the other hand, are considered selective predators that \n\nhave a facultative feeding strategy, specializing on rabbits when present or on rodents \n\nwhen abundant and rabbits lacking, and shifting to alternative prey, such as \n\ninvertebrates or reptiles, when rabbits are absent and rodents not very abundant (Lozano \n\net al. 2006).  \n\nWorthwhile mention was the occurrence of two carnivore species in cat scats found far \n\nfrom human settlements, probably evidencing intraguild-predation events as already \n\nreported (e.g. Palomares and Caro 1999). No study on the diet of domestic cats refers \n\nthe predation on midsize carnivores, already verified in wildcat diet studies \u2013 domestic \n\ncat (Tryjanowski et al. 2002, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2005), common genet and stone marten \n\n(Mole\u00f3n and Gil-S\u00e1nchez 2003). These are predation evidences, although scavenging \n\nshould also be an option similarly to what have might happen relatively to the ungulate \n\nremains found in 9.71% of scats originating from the same group of latrines. The \n\ndifferences between wildcat and feral domestic cat diets are reflected in the analysis of \n\nprey items found in this study, separating most of the scats from latrines near houses \n\nfrom those far from human settlements and located in natural areas, typically associated \n\nwith domestic and wildcats, respectively. In continental landmasses, as the case of \n\nEurope, where prey species co-evolved with a great diversity of predators, like the \n\nwildcats, the domestic cats accompanies the man distribution that offers a plenty of food \n\nresources that they do not have to share with other predators (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon \n\n1986). In the wild, co-existing carnivores have to compete for prey and because of that \n\nintra-guild predation may occur. The differences in domestic cat and wildcat diet reflect \n\ntheir relation with humans, showing the domestic cat less dependent of the prey density. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 129 \n\nInversely the wildcat depends on an optimal hunting strategy for they main preys \n\n(Liberg 1984).  The overview of the world domestic cat diet confirmed mammals as the \n\nmore frequent main prey, represented by rabbits in the islands and natural areas and \n\nrodents in urban places. Nevertheless, birds are the most frequent (number of areas \n\nwhere the item occurred) item in world cats diet in islands and natural areas, substitute \n\nby human refuse in urban places. Another interesting data is that the number of different \n\nitems consumed by domestic cats increased with the human presence, reinforcing the \n\nnature of a generalist and opportunistic species. This positive relation, found in islands, \n\nis consequence of the increase prey diversity due to the presence of exotic species, \n\nlinked to human presence, like house mice and rabbits in many islands (Nogales and \n\nMedina 1986). However, this result may be biased by the larger representativity of \n\nstudies in islands. Identical results, were obtained in the fine scale analysis (latrine \n\ngroups) where human refuse was significantly related to the number of prey consumed, \n\npossibly because human settlements promote the presence of opportunistic prey, like \n\nhouse mice. Unlike wildcats, domestic cats mainly eat young rabbits and the hunting \n\ntechniques appear not to be adapted to exploiting adult rabbits (Liberg 1984, Catling \n\n1988). Our worldwide review confirmed that the consumption of rabbits is associated \n\nwith an increase in the diversity of items consumed. The same applies to the wildcat \n\ndiet, with trophic diversity increasing with the inclusion of alternative prey such as \n\nrabbits (Lozano et al. 2006). The urban and natural areas seem to describe better the \n\nfood regime of domestic cat in continental land mass, with a diet pattern that is \n\nconsequence of the relationships between domestic cat and humans. The food regime of \n\ndomestic cats in islands, on the other hand, must be analysed in the context of meso-\n\npredator release (Fitzgerald 1988, Arnaud et al. 1993), due to the absence of \n\ncompetitors and top predators that lead to the possibility of exploiting the whole \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The number of carnivore \n\nspecies with more than 2kg, which may compete and/or predate domestic cats, and \n\npotentially occur in the geographic areas of each study, represent in islands an average \n\nof 0.22 \u00b1 0.4 carnivore species, 1.7 \u00b1 1.0 in urban places and 2.3 \u00b1 1.1 in natural areas. \n\nThis knowledge is relevant in the context of extensive ecological studies. Variation in \n\nfeeding behaviour among domestic cat populations over a broad scale of environmental \n\nconditions, is quite important to understand the relation between domestic cats and food \n\nresources in continental natural areas, as well as potential competitive effects with the \n\nwildcat. Nevertheless, the small sample of studies in continental natural areas, with the \n\nexception of Australia, limits the analysis on the feeding ecology of the species due to \n\nthe lack of robust results. This information is vital to know more about the mechanisms \n\nthat limit the capacity of expansion and colonization of natural areas by domestic cats. \n\nIn these areas, prey developed anti-predatory strategies and are preyed by several \n\ncarnivore species with which domestic cats have to compete. Furthermore, human \n\nabsence implies that human refuse and comensal prey species, like house mice, are not \n\navailable for domestic cats, thereby limiting their expansion in these areas.  \n\nImplications on wildcat conservation \n\nThis study supports the idea that, in continental natural areas of Iberian Peninsula, the \n\ndomestic cat depends on human refuse and comensal prey, reinforcing the results \n\nobtained in the study on domestic cats spatial ecology in the study area (Ferreira et al. \n\nSubmitted - Paper II of this Thesis). On the other hand, rabbits formed the main \n\ncomponent of the diet of wildcats in Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (Gil-S\u00e1nchez et \n\nal. 1999, Lozano et al. 2006) and species distribution depends greatly on rabbit\u2019s \n\nabundance (Ferreira et al. 2003, Monterroso et al. 2009). Unlike, wildcat, the feral \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? \n \n\n 131 \n\ndomestic cats only occasionally consumed lagomorphs (Borkenhagen 1978 and 1979, \n\nFitzgerald 1988), eating mostly juveniles and sick individuals, and only on exceptional \n\noccasions rabbits were the main prey item (Liberg, 1984). Nevertheless, if the food \n\nresources associated with human presence disappear or became limit, the domestic-feral \n\ncats may start foraging in wildcat habitats and compete for shared resources (Bir\u00f3 et al. \n\n2005). Additionally, this will promote direct encounters with wildcat and other \n\ncarnivore species, and increase the risk of hybridization and disease transmission \n\n(Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Bir\u00f3 et al. 2004, Germain et al. 2008). To decrease domestic cats \n\nabundance in natural areas of Iberian Peninsula is therefore crucial for wildcat \n\nconservation.  \n\n \n\n5.5 REFERENCES \n\nAchterberg H, Metzger R (1979) Untersuchungen zur ern\u00e3hrungsbiologie von \n\nhauskatzen aus dem kreis haldensleben und dem stadtkreis magdeburg.

The most important viruses carried by \n\ndomestic and wild cats, and that of concern in this study, are feline calicivirus (FCV), feline \n\nherpes virus (FHV), feline panleukopenia (FPV), feline coronovirus (FCoV), feline leukaemia \n\nvirus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). To obtain a global overview of feline-\n\nimportant virus prevalence in domestic (Felis catus) and wild cats (Irimote cat Felis \n\niriomotensis, sand cat Felis margarita, and European wildcat Felis silvestris) we analyzed the \n\ndata of twenty five studies published in five continents (Europe - n=11, Asia - n=6, Australia \u2013 \n\nn=1, and America - n=7), referring to a total of 36 areas. Hypotheses tested are: 1) Species \n\ndensity and social structure affects prevalence: high species densities promote high prevalence \n\nfor the milder diseases, and prevalence rates increases in social groups; 2) Virus occurrence is \n\nrelated with other virus prevalence. To understand the influence of environment (island, natural, \n\nrural and urban), cat species and global viral prevalence in the occurrence of the six focal virus \n\nunder analysis we use generalised linear models and the presence/absence of each virus type per \n\ncat sample. The environment and species were present in the FIV, FCoV and FPV best models, \n\nwhile other virus prevalence was significant for FeLV, FCV and FHV. The best model for FIV \n\ncorroborates the hypothesis 1), with a \u201cpositive\u201d contribution of urban and \u201cnegative\u201d of natural \n\nareas, as the more important descriptors for virus occurrence. Further, FIV prevalence appears \n\ncorrelated with species sociability, being higher in rural and urban areas. The hypothesis 2), that \n\nthe occurrence of a certain type virus is relate with other virus prevalence, was confirmed in the \n\nmodels for all six viruses, with special relevance for FeLV contributions. The most virulent \n\nvirus (FIV and FeLV) need host direct contacts for propagation and once established, their \n\nprevalence affects other virus occurrence. And for some virus, like FeLV, the distribution of \n\ncats nucleus in natural areas is a determinant factor for virus propagation. In natural areas the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.

The most important viruses carried by cats are feline calicivirus \n\n(FCV), feline herpes virus (FHV), feline panleukopenia (FPV), feline coronovirus \n\n(FCoV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) \n\n(Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegger et al. 1999, Fromont et al. 2000, Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009a). \n\nThe high variability in virus prevalence is influence to cat social organization and \n\nmating system, which can be explained by the mode of transmission of these viruses \n\n(Courchamp et al. 1998, Fromont et al. 2003). The most common ways of FeLV \n\ntransmission are bites, nasal secretions, mutual grooming, shared food and water. The \n\nadult cats are more resistant to FeLV than kittens, which are infected by the positive \n\nfemales during gestation or shed virus in milk (Green 1990, Arjona et al. 2000). FeLV \n\nrelated immunosuppression causes increased susceptibility to bacteria and other viral \n\ninfections, and his persistence in the environment does not exceed a few hours (Green \n\n1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Quimm et al. 2002). Like FeLV, FIV has a worldwide \n\ndistribution and is related to cat density. The primary mode of FIV transmission, that is \n\nalso not viable in environment, is through bite wounds, and casual non aggressive \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 144 \n\ncontact among cats rarely results in the spread of the virus. In fact, the infection is \n\ncharacterized by risk factors linked to aggressive behaviour: old mature male adults \n\nhaving dispersed are more likely to be infected (Fouchet et al. 2009). The maternal \n\ntransmission occurs primarily when the female is exposed to FIV and becomes infected \n\nduring gestation or lactation. Spread of FIV through sexual contact is an uncommon \n\nevent. The prevalence of FIV affects, in general, between one and three percent of the \n\npopulation (Green 1990). Another virus that needs contact between individuals to \n\nspread is FHV since cannot exist outside of the host; the way of transmission is through \n\nrespiratory and oral secretions (Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Packer et al. 1999, \n\nQuimm et al. 2002). Mortality rates are higher in kittens or if individuals are \n\nimmunocompromised for another reason (e.g. cats with FeLV or FIV, stress, illness) \n\n(Packer et al. 1999). Neonatal kittens are exposed to FHV during birth if their mother is \n\ninfected with the virus (Quimm et al. 2002). Other group of viruses (FPV, FCV, FCoV) \n\ndoes not need contact between individuals and mode of transmission, besides oral, nasal \n\nand ocular secretions, can be through faeces for FCV and FCoV, and also urine for FPV \n\n(Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Packer et al. 1999, Quimm et al. 2002). In addition, \n\nfleas may transmit FPV from infected to susceptible cats during the acute stage of the \n\ndisease (Green 1990). Nevertheless, they present different environmental persistence: \n\nFCV can survive for as long as one week, FCoV from hours to weeks and FPV until a \n\nyear (Green 1990, Packer et al. 1999). FCV is very common in kittens and multicat \n\nhouseholds and affects all cat breeds. FCoV is a very contagious virus and usually infect \n\ncats under 3 years of age, however almost never crosses the placenta to the unborn \n\nkitten (Green 1990). Most kittens usually become infected between 5-7 weeks of age, \n\nwhen the protective antibodies that they receive from their mother's milk are no longer \n\nactive (Green 1990). FPV infection can be a fatal primary disease, affecting cats of all \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 145 \n\nages, and it is primarily a disease of kittens (Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Steinel et \n\nal. 2001). The characteristics of the disease may vary considerably from population to \n\npopulation and from outbreak to outbreak. In susceptible populations, the disease may \n\naffect nearly 100 percent of individuals, resulting in a mortality rate that may vary \n\nbetween 25 to 75 percent (Packer et al. 1999). \n\nCats are found in a wide variety of ecological conditions and have developed highly \n\nvariable population structures, ranging from solitary living individuals in low-dense \n\npopulations to social groups in high-density populations (Liberg and Sandell 1988). \n\nInfectious agents play a relevant role in ecosystems, and are an important element in the \n\ndynamics of host populations (Altizer et al. 2003). Nevertheless, host-pathogen \n\nrelationship has being disturbed mainly by environmental changes caused by human \n\nactivity (Daszak 2000, Deem et al. 2001). This is frequently associated with the \n\npathogen introduction into wild populations by man, or with a change in the host\u2019s \n\nsusceptibility to infections (Grenfell and Dobson 1995). Incidence itself depends on the \n\nrelation between population size, density, and rate of contact for efficient disease \n\ntransmission. Characteristics like density and spatial structure of domestic cats \n\npopulations depend on the abundance and distribution of resources linked to human \n\npresence (Kerby and McDonald 1988). In fact, there are notable differences in the \n\norganization of cat populations in terms of dispersal pattern, mating system and \n\nindividual behaviour, according to resources distribution. At very low density (less than \n\n10 cats km-2) as in low humanized natural-rural areas, individual home ranges are larger \n\nand intra-specific encounters among adult cats are uncommon (Kerby and Mcdonald \n\n1988). However, these environments favour the contact between domestic cat and other \n\ncarnivore species and two types of interactions may occur: intraguild predation, \n\nparticular in encounters with red foxes Vulpes vulpes, Iberian lynxes Lynx pardinus or \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 146 \n\nother large carnivores, or agonistic behaviours and hybridization with wildcats (e.g. \n\nEuropena wildcat Felis silvestris).  \n\nThe occurrence and prevalence of viral pathogens varies because of several factors like, \n\nhabitat structure, human presence, domestic cat and carnivore species population size \n\nand distribution. For example in Scotland, were the contacts between the domestic cats \n\nand the wildcats were frequent, the later were commonly infected with the major viruses \n\nof the domestic cats, except for FIV (Daniels et al. 1999). Low prevalence of diseases \n\nwas found in Slovenian wildcats, suggesting a low level of contact between both \n\npopulations (Ra?nik et al. 2008), but domestic cat populations change their density, \n\nsociability and size of family groups in function of availability of resources (Liberg and \n\nSandell 1988).  \n\nOur interest focused on six (FeLV, FIV, FHV, FCV, FPV and FCoV) most common \n\nvirus affecting domestic cat and wildcat populations (Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegger \n\net al. 1999, Fromont et al. 2000, Millan et al. 2009a) in order to test the a priori \n\nhypotheses:    \n\n1. Species density and structure affects prevalence;  \n\ni. High species densities promote high prevalence for the milder diseases;    \n\nii. The prevalence rates increase in social groups. \n\n2.

Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 148 \n\nThe studies that used clinical data from house cats were not selected in our analysis \n\nbecause they were not representative of urban-feral populations. Fourteen studies (56%) \n\nrefered to natural areas, seven (23%) to urban, two (8%) to rural areas, and two (8%) to \n\nislands The studies were performed in areas that exemplify different cats densities, \n\nranging from natural habitats, with lower densities, to urban areas characterized by \n\nhigh-density populations (Liberg and Sandell 1988). To understand the influence of \n\nenvironment, cat species and other virus prevalence in the six focal virus occurrence, we \n\nused generalised linear models with a binomial error distribution and a logit link \n\nfunction in R software. Presence/absence of each virus per cat sample was related with \n\ncat species, environment (island, natural, rural and urban) and the other virus prevalence \n\nin the sampled population, using direct logistic regression analyses in which all \n\npredictors entered the equations simultaneously (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996). Before \n\nfitting these models, we calculated a correlation matrix among all the predictor variables \n\nusing Spearman rank coefficients (Sokal and Rohlf 1995); candidate models containing \n\nhighly correlated predictors (R >0.7) were modified or eliminated from the dataset. \n\nCandidate models were compared according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \n\nthat provides an objective tool to rank these models and thus quantify the evidence for \n\neach hypothesis (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Knowing that species sociability \n\nincreases contacts between individuals, we correlate the social behaviour of species \n\n(domestic cat, Irimote cat, sand cat and wildcat) with virus occurrence and prevalence. \n\nDespite some cats cohabiting in colonies, domestic cats do not have a social survival \n\nstrategy (Bradshaw et al. 1996). Nevertheless, we used the term sociability in the \n\nperspective of the existence of groups of individuals that cohabite, and regularly share \n\nresources. Therefore, we consider domestic cat as a social species and the other as no \n\nsocial species.   \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 149 \n\n \n\n6.3 RESULTS \n\nThe worldwide average prevalence rates in cat populations in natural areas was 21.9% \n\nfor FIV, 29.9% for FeLV, 39.7% for FCV, 7.7% for FHV, 2.3% for FCoV and 17.5% \n\nfor FPV. From the twenty five worldwide studies addressed to analysed virus \n\nprevalences in urban, rural, natural areas and islands, FCV and FeLV presents the \n\nmayor number of positives, mostly from natural areas. In contrast, FIV with lower \n\nconfirmations for FIV (Table 6.2).  \n\n \n\nTable 6.2.  Number of addressed worldwide studies, of the total dataset (n=25), performed in \n\nUrban (U), Rural (R), Natural (N) and Islands (I), that analysed prevalence of six virus types: \n\nFeline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), Feline Leukaemia (FeLV), Feline Herpesvirus (FHV), \n\nFeline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV), Feline Calicivirus (FCV) and Feline Corona Virus (FeCoV). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe FCV, FeLV and FIV seem to have higher prevalence rates then the other virus, \n\ninversely to FCoV that showed the lowest value. However, this analysis may be biased \n\nby the size of the samples (Table 6.3). In the worldwide studies of cat populations FCV \n\npresents the higher values of virus prevalence in domestic cats from natural areas and \n\nsecond more high, after FeLV, in wildcats. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.

Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 153 \n\nThe environment and species was also retained in best models for FIV, FCoV and FPV, \n\nbut the first was only significant for FIV while species was for FPV. Other virus \n\nprevalence are the unique variables in the best models for FeLV, FCV and FHV, with \n\nFeLV and FIV viruses representing the only descriptors in models selected for FCV and \n\nFHV. In the FeLV best model, the contributions of FHV and FPV were highly \n\nsignificant, pvalue &lt;0.001 and pvalue = 0.007 respectively, with a negative influence of FHV \n\nprevalence for FeLV occurrence. Natural environments, negatively influenced FIV \n\noccurrence, while in urban areas show a positive contribution. The occurrences of FCV, \n\nFHV and FCoV were significantly associated with FeLV prevalence. Also, for the FPV \n\npresence is still influent, together with the host species and the environment where the \n\nhost population is located (Table 6.5). A significant positive correlation was found \n\nbetween species sociability and FIV (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test: rs = 0.703, P &lt;\n\n0.0001, n = 40) and FHV (rs = 0.556, P &lt;0.03, n=15) prevalences, and negative with \n\nFeLV (rs = -0.508, P &lt;0.0023, n=34.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4 DISCUSSION  \n\nIn our hypothesis, high species densities promote high prevalence for milder diseases, \n\nwhich increases with the existence of social groups. Our results support this hypothesis \n\nonce, the best model for FIV includes the \u201cpositive\u201d contribution of urban and the \n\n\u201cnegative\u201d of natural areas, as the more important descriptors for the virus occurrence. \n\nMoreover, the FIV prevalence appears correlated with species sociability, reflecting the \n\nworldwide data where the virus prevalence is higher in rural and urban areas (see Figure \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 154 \n\n1). Courchamp et al. (1998) refers that FIV is practically solely transmitted by bitting \n\nand therefore social behaviour of species can favour virus transmission in rural areas \n\nwhere cats show a well-marked polygynous mating system. However if cats nucleus are \n\nsmall and spaced, encounters between individuals may be a very rare event, especially if \n\nthe habitat environmental is not favourable (less humanized) for domestic cat \n\nmovements. Our second hypothesis, that virus occurrence is influenced by the \n\nprevalence of other virus, seems to be confirmed in the models for all six viruses, with \n\nspecial relevance for FeLV. The, negative correlation found between FeLV and species \n\nsociability, could be the expression of virus impact in populations with polygynous \n\nmating systems, once the fertility of viremic females is strongly reduced, resulting in \n\nhigh rates of abortion, and the few live kittens are viremic at birth and die early (Hoover \n\net al. 1983). In natural or rural populations, when farms are connected to villages or \n\nwhen several surrounding populations lead to high numbers of feral cats roaming \n\nbetween populations, FeLV could be continuously present in the area (Fromont et al. \n\n2003). Therefore, the impact of FeLV in domestic cats population growth increases and \n\ndisease may act on distant populations through dispersal (Frommont et al. 2003), like \n\nwildcat populations in natural areas. In a detailed study that assessed FeLV risk, \n\nFromont et al. (1998) hypothesized, that small population size may be responsible for \n\ntoo few contacts among cats to maintain persistent infection. The negative contribution \n\nof FHV prevalence  to FeLV occurrence reinforces the idea of virus interactions. \n\nTherefore, we expect an increase of virus prevalence in high-density populations where \n\nthe contacts between individuals are more frequent, specially in species with well-\n\nmarked social behaviours.  \n\nMoreover, each viral agent has its mode of propagation, which is dependent on \n\nindividual interactions in the host populations. In wildcat populations, the virus \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations \n \n\n 155 \n\nprevalence depends largely on stress conditions of their populations, if we exclude \n\ncontact with domestic cats. These in turn, exhibit different population structures \n\naccording to the type of occurrence areas: urban, rural and natural areas. Accordingly, it \n\nis expected that viruses respond to this change in host population structure. The \n\ndomestic cat serves as a vehicle for dispersion of viral agents between their colonies and \n\nthe wildcat populations. Therefore, free-ranging cats hosting viral agents in natural \n\nareas have more opportunity to interact with other carnivores and therefore increase the \n\nrisk of diseases transmission (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009).  \n\nImplications on wildcat conservation \n\nThe occurrence and prevalence of viral agents are very dependent on the spatial and \n\nsocial structure of the host population (Fromont et al. 2003) and for some virus, like \n\nFeLV, the distribution of cats nucleus in natural areas is a determinant factor for virus \n\npropagation. In natural areas cats distribution and densities are associated to human \n\npresence, and resources availability provided, directly or indirectly, by man (Ferreira et \n\nal. submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). In addition, the human activities like agro-\n\nforestry, agriculture activities and road densities favours domestic cat expansion, \n\nincreasing the intra-specific and inter-specific contacts, and for the fragmentation of \n\nwildcat populations. This is quite relevant because the fragmentation of species \n\npopulations, associate with human persecution, conduct to the existence of stress \n\nfactors, that affects the virus prevalence (Pontier et al. 2009).      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.

General discussion \n\n7.1  INTRODUCTION \n\nThe idea behind the thesis relates to the factors that, by force of human presence and \n\nactivities, may affect wildcat populations in Iberian Peninsula. In general, the factors \n\nthat critically affect the survival of carnivores are the scarcity of food resources, \n\nhabitat destruction and degradation, human persecution and infectious diseases. In the \n\ncase of the wildcat we can add a fourth element which is the introgression with \n\ndomestic cat (Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Oliveira et al. 2008), that may endanger the genetic \n\nintegrity of their populations. Hybridization, transmission of viral diseases and \n\ncompetition due to trophic niche overlap, have all been associated with the domestic \n\ncat (Courchamps et al. 1995, Fromont et al. 2003, Pontier et al. 2009), which is in turn \n\nheavily dependent of human populations. In this perspective, humans are a key-issue \n\nin wildcat conservation strategies, justifying the investment in the knowledge on the \n\ninteractions between wildcats, domestic cats and, consequently, humans. My research \n\nshed light on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by human-\n\nrelated activities. Moreover, with this approach it is possible to learn important lessons \n\nabout the mutual interactions among wildcats and domestic-free ranging-feral cats, and \n\nthe effects of human land uses, that can be generalised to other similar situations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 164 \n\n7.2 OVERVIEW OF MAIN FINDINGS \n \n\n \n \n\n7.2.1Large scale requirements of wildcat distribution in Iberian \n\nPeninsula  \n\nTo evaluate the more important requirements in the wildcat Iberian distribution we \n\nused the advantages of correlative and mechanistic models to detect which are the \n\nlarge-scale determinants that express the local individual preferences (Paper I). \n\nWildcat natural history and behaviour, obtained from ecological research at fine scales, \n\nsuggest the importance of small mammals as prey, as well as a negative influence of \n\nhuman disturbance (Paper I). Apparently, habitat, coded as type of vegetation cover, is \n\nnot influencing the distribution of the wildcat, thus reinforcing Lozano et al. (2003) \n\nopinion that the species is more habitat generalist than at first suspected, and is not \n\nbehaving as a strictly forestall species (Stahl and Artois 1994). Moreover, at a large \n\nscale the wildcat does not show different requirements along its distribution range, \n\nwith human disturbance and the number of species of small mammals as main \n\ndescriptors for the wildcat distribution between temperate forest and Mediterranean \n\nvegetation (paper I). The relationship between prey availability and vegetation \n\nstructure, namely the importance of pastures \u2013 scrubland mosaics for the wild rabbit in \n\nMediterranean areas of Iberian Peninsula (Lozano et al. 2003), is a good example to \n\nshow how the wildcat presence is indirectly related to vegetation type, because of the \n\nlink between main prey and vegetation. In Mediterranean areas, dominated by \n\nsclerophylous vegetation, wildcats use rabbits as main prey (Malo et al. 2004, Ferreira \n\n2003, Monterroso et al. 2009), while in Atlantic regions, mainly covered by mixed and \n\nbroad-leaved forests, small mammals are the staple food (Lozano et al. 2006). In spite \n\n\n\n \n\n 165 \n\nof the importance of small mammals for the wildcat in Atlantic areas, we found that \n\nthis group of prey represent the most relevant predictor for species occurrence also in \n\nMediterranean areas, opposed to the idea of specialization on rabbits. Probably, \n\nwildcats just take advantage of local wild rabbit\u2019s abundance, and its importance as a \n\ncomplementary food source is reinforced by the lower number of species of small \n\nmammals in Mediterranean areas. Represented by the relation of human occupation \n\nwith elevation range, human disturbance is another important variable explaining the \n\npattern of wildcat occurrence (Paper I). The negative relation between wildcat \n\noccurrence and human presence suggests a strong impact of human activities most \n\nprobably through habitat destruction, direct killing and increasing contacts with \n\ndomestic cats. Nevertheless, the impact of human presence is hard to quantify, given \n\nthe multiple factors that act on the species, especially direct killing, which is not \n\nreported due to its illegality. This is particularly relevant in natural-rural areas where \n\nthe number and distribution of human settlements and households can differ in terms \n\nof human density, representing different disturbance scenarios for wildcat populations \n\n(Papers I and II).  \n\n7.2.2  Humans and domestic cats relationships in rural-natural areas \n\nHigh human density supports higher cat densities, linking the expansion of cats in \n\nnature to different levels of human occupation. The pattern of farm occupation by \n\npeople is the main factor determining the distribution and abundance of domestic cats \n\nin natural or semi-natural areas (Paper II). Space use by domestic cats in our study area \n\nshowed that females centred their home ranges on farms and males made long travels \n\nto find available females in the mating season (Paper II, see also Barratt 1997, \n\nGermain et. al. 2008). In fact, the distribution and density of females are the primary \n\n\n\n \n\n 166 \n\nfactors determining male range size (Liberg and Sandell 1988), and the maximum \n\ndistances travelled in a season are associated to the distance to the nearest farm with \n\nfemales (Paper II). On the other hand, the daily movements of domestic cats was only \n\nconstrained by red fox density that may translate into a high risk of predation (Paper \n\nII). Predation of cat offspring was observed during this study in Noudar Castle where \n\nthe pups of the tracked female F310 were killed by an Egyptian mongoose (pers. \n\nobsv.). In fact, feral or free ranging cats are more likely to be rare or absent in regions \n\nwith well-preserved wild predator populations (Macdonald and Thom 2001). Domestic \n\ncats may move between farms but they have to share space with other carnivores, \n\nincreasing the probability of interaction. Then it is more advantageous for farm cats to \n\nstay near secure shelters (farms) and avoid these interactions, especially with species \n\nthat are more competitive or with predators. Dependence on people is also visible in \n\nthe diet of the domestic cat, even in the vicinity of natural areas, where the diversity of \n\npotential prey is higher (Paper III). Domestic cats temporarily linked to humans may \n\nconsume alternative prey (Fitzgerald 1988) around human settlements during the \n\nperiods of natural food shortage, but they depend on human presence for their \n\npopulations to increase. In continental landmasses, as the case of Europe, where prey \n\nspecies co-evolved with a great diversity of predators, like wildcats, the domestic cat \n\nbenefits from staying in the proximity of people because they offer plenty food \n\nresources that they do not have to share with other predators. The differences found in \n\nthe diets of domestic and wildcats illustrates well this relation between wild prey, \n\npredators, and man. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 167 \n\n7.2.3 Spatial structure of domestic cat populations in natural-rural areas \n\nand relation with virus prevalence  \n\nThe spatial occupation of farmhouses and human changes in the landscape are \n\nresponsible for the distribution and displacements of domestic cats in natural-rural \n\nareas, and this potentially leads to the spreading of diseases to wildlifes (especially \n\nFIV and FelV) and hybridization with the wildcat (Courchamp et al. 1995, Fromont et \n\nal. 1997, Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegge et al. 1999). The occurrence and prevalence \n\nof viral agents are very dependent on the spatial and social structure of the host \n\npopulation (Fromont et al. 2003) and the existence of stress factors (Pontier et al. \n\n2009). Moreover, each viral agent has its mode of propagation, which is dependent on \n\ninteractions between individuals. In wildcat populations, if we exclude contact with \n\ndomestic cats, disease prevalence depends largely on stress conditions of the \n\npopulation.. Domestic cats in turn, exhibit different population structures according to \n\nthe type of environment where they occur, being this either urban, rural or natural \n\nareas (Paper IV). Accordingly, it is expected that viruses go hand in hand with changes \n\nin the population structure of the host. The domestic cat serves as a vehicle for \n\ndispersion of viral agents between their colonies and the wildcat populations. \n\nTherefore, free-ranging cats in natural areas are likely to transmit diseases due to the \n\nopportunities to interact with other carnivores (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009). The structure that \n\ncharacterizes polygamous colonies of cats in natural and rural areas is the one that \n\nmost closely approximates that of the wildcat populations. Therefore, the impact of \n\nvirus on domestic cats populations increases, including the transmission of the disease \n\nto distant populations through dispersal (Frommont et al. 2003), including wildcat \n\npopulations in natural areas. Apparently, FeLV occurrence have large influence on the \n\nprevalence of other viruses (Paper IV) and is probably the most dangerous virus for \n\n\n\n \n\n 168 \n\nwild feline populations in Europe. In natural areas with rural-farms connected to \n\nvillages, either by the proximity or by their density, the number of cats roaming \n\nbetween the various colonies increases, contributing to a continued persistence of \n\nFeLV in the area. When the villages are far from rural-farms, the contacts between \n\ndomestic cats, which determine FeLV persistence, will depend on their dispersal \n\nhability and the distance between active farms (Fromon et al. 2003) (Paper II). High \n\ndispersal rates will promote the contacts between domestic cats-domestic cats and \n\ndomestic cats-wildcats, and as a result the probability of transmission and prevalence \n\nof FeLV and other viruses will increase (Paper IV).  \n\n \n\n7.3 IMPLICATIONS FOR WILDCAT CONSERVATION \n\n7.3.1Habitat management and prey restocking / recovery \n\nFor a long time the conservation of wildcat focused on two main threat factors: loss of \n\nforested habitats and hybridisation with the domestic cat. In large part, this was due to \n\nthe fact that most of the knowledge on the species originated from outside the Iberian \n\nPeninsula (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Only more recently, it was shown that the \n\nassociation between wildcat and Mediterranean vegetation, was not merely a \n\nconsequence of its direct role as shelter, but resulted also from the indirect effect of \n\nproviding an abundant food resource \u2013 the wild rabbit (Moreno and Villafuert 1995, \n\nLozano et al. 2003, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006). Over decades, in rural areas people \n\nconducted small shrub removals for cattle grazing or to facilitate access to new \n\nexploitation areas, shaping a highly diverse landscape. These landscape mosaics \n\npromote prey diversity and availability, especially in terms of rabbits and rodents, the \n\n\n\n \n\n 169 \n\nstaple food of wildcats worldwide (Lozano et al. 2003, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2003, \n\nFern\u00e1ndez 2005, Klar et al. 2008). The traditional farming system was highly diverse, \n\ncombining the production of several types of grazing species (sheep, goats, Iberian \n\npigs and cattle). However, changes in the agricultural policies that started in the 60\u2019s, \n\nhave led to a larger investment in cattle production with the consequent decrease in the \n\nnumbers of small ruminants (Joffre et al. 1988). A good example of this changing \n\nprocess can be seen in vast areas of the \u2018montado\u2019system (or \u2018dehesa\u2019 in Spain), the \n\nlandscape matrix of most southern Iberia, where the intensification of cattle production \n\nleaded to extensive clear-cutting of understorey, and consequent decrease in prey \n\navailability. This in turn decreased the abundance of prey and increased disturbance, \n\ndue to intense cattle grazing. The opposite situation occurs when large amounts of \n\nprivate areas are devoted to big game hunting and shrubs are allowed to growth to \n\nprovide better shelter opportunities to game species. In immediate terms, this \n\nmanagement option may also have a positive effect in the wildcat in face of its high \n\ncover requirements (Stahl and Artois 1994). However, the absence of a mosaic \n\nstructure in the landscape and the usually  high densities of big game species, also \n\ndecreases prey abundance, especially rabbits (Lozano et al. 2007), a already declining \n\nspecies due to other threats. In the last decades wild rabbit  populations suffered a high \n\ndecline (Malo et al. 2004), mainly as consequence of mixomatosis and hemorrahagic \n\ndiseases (RHD), with direct consequences on the reproductive success of predators \n\n(Rodriguez and Delibes 1992). The recovery of rabbit populations is a hard task in \n\nconservation and species restocking is frequently carried out for hunting purposes, \n\nwith thousands of individuals being introduced every year, often ending in failure \n\n(Calvete et al. 1997). Small mammals, the other key prey for wildcats, in many \n\ncommunities show preference for habitats with high vegetation cover (Kotler and \n\n\n\n \n\n 170 \n\nBrown 1988), a fact that is closely related with the perceived predation risk (D\u00edaz \n\n1992), and consequently are also affected by changes in the traditional farming system. \n\nHowever, a proper understanding on how human-induced changes in habitats and \n\nlandscapes affect small mammal populations is still lacking, albeit being crucial to \n\nundertake the management and conservation of Mediterranean ecosystems. As shown, \n\nalthough needing cover the wildcat is not a specialist in a particular vegetation type \n\n(Paper I), but the composition, quantity and shape of vegetation cover, is important in \n\ndetermining prey availability. Human activities, namely agro-pastoral-forestry and \n\nhunting practices, have therefore a large influence in the habitat suitability for the \n\nspecies. In table 7.1, I summarise the main features that relate land management \n\noptions with prey availability and disturbance for wildcats.  \n\nTable 7.1. Different scenarios of land management options and their implications for wildcat \n\nconservation in Mediterranean areas \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 171 \n\nThe immediate conservation needs for the wildcat in the Mediterranean region must \n\ntherefore concentrate in promoting prey availability; which in turn is dependent of \n\nmaintaining natural vegetation patches and low levels of agricultural intensification. \n\nTo re-established sustainable land uses that incorporate the conservation of natural \n\nvalues it is necessary the maintenance of an equilibrium occupancy between the \n\nscrubland and agriculture patches. The multi-uses of landscape, instead of a large \n\nmatrix with a unique use, will promote the diversity and abundance of prey. Important \n\nhabitats that in many situations, usually forme small parts of the landscape and are \n\noften the focus of intensive human activity, are the riparian habitats. In fact, besides \n\npresenting numerous challenges for land managers, these habitat offer, in \n\nhomogeneous landscapes, the ultimate conditions for species occurrence, increasing \n\nprey availability in the matrix.  \n\n7.3.2 Limiting domestic cats density and movements in rural farms \n\nThe most effective strategy for decreasing rates of hybridization involves, not only, \n\nhabitat restoration that allows a healthy community of native carnivores to persist, but \n\nalso eliminating or reducing the factors (farm resources) that promote domestic cats \n\nincrease in numbers. Farm occupation by people is the main factor determining \n\ndomestic cat distribution and abundance in natural Mediterranean areas (Paper II). \n\nOther anthropogenic structures, like roads and households, also favour domestic cat \n\nexpansion to natural areas. Furthermore, because private landowners are the ultimate \n\ncontrollers of their land, they may be carrying out a wide variety of actions that could \n\ninfluence the distribution and abundance of cats. This information is therefore vital to \n\nbetter understand the mechanisms that limit the capacity of expansion and colonization \n\nof new areas by the domestic cats. In natural areas with no people, cats are strictly \n\n\n\n \n\n 172 \n\ndependent of wild prey, while in urban habitats human refuse and opportunistic prey \n\nspecies like the house mice constitute the bulk of the cats diet (Paper III). A success \n\nstrategy to reduce feral cats in rural-natural areas is therefore to limit the access by cats \n\nto human refuse. Moreover, in natural or rural areas the pattern of house farms \n\ndistribution affects the distribution and numbers of domestic cats. In fact, until the \n\nearly twenties human density in rural areas of the Mediterranean was much higher than \n\ntoday, with rural farms fully active, and typically including farm cats to control \n\nrodents. Cat densities in these areas were probably much higher at that time. \n\nThe distribution and abundance of domestic cat females are determined in first place \n\nby the resources provide by people (Devillard et al. 2003). However, for males, the \n\nmain factor is the distribution of females (Liberg and Sandell 1988). With increased \n\ndistances between operative farms, where cats still concentrate, males have to travel \n\nlonger distances and spend more energy in mate guarding. Table 7.2, presents different \n\nscenarios depending on active farms location and landscape features, with different \n\nimplications on domestic cat distribution and population dynamics, leading to different \n\nlevels of threats to wildcat populations. In general, the spatial distribution of active \n\nfarms, the quantity and quality of available resources and the characteristics of the \n\nlandscape determines the impact on wildcat populations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 173 \n\nTable 7.2. Different scenarios of active farms distribution, landscape features and different levels of impact to wildcat populations. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 174 \n\nTo reduce free-ranging cat populations it is essential not to provide direct food for cats, \n\nprevent access to the barns, which provides them safe shelter, and an additional prey \n\nsource-house mouse. The rodents inside the barn can be controlled by barn owls Tyto \n\nalba, simply by the existence of windows located in places inaccessible to cats. At the \n\nsame time, it is important that natural habitats be protected because this limits the cats \n\ndisplacements, and increase the probability of predation on them.   \n\n7.3.3 Information gaps and research needs \n\nA disagreement seems to exist in what concerns the conservation status of the wildcat in \n\ndifferent areas of its southern European range, in spite of the fact that identified threat \n\nfactors operate at large scale. In Europe, the IUCN classifies the species as Least \n\nConcern (IUCN 2006) while in Portugal the wildcat is considered Vulnerable (Cabral et \n\nal. 2005) and in Spain Near Threatened (Palomo 2007). Nevertheless, there is no data \n\non the distribution of the species based on systematic surveys despite of the \n\nrecommendations of the Council of Europe to Portugal and Spain (Council of Europe \n\n1992). The Red Data Book of Vertebrates of Portugal refers to non-natural mortality \n\n(as consequence of road kills and illegal hunting), hybridization with domestic cat and \n\nhabitat destruction as the main threats (Cabral et al. 2005). However, in the absence of \n\nrobust data on small mammals and rabbit distribution and abundance it is impossible to \n\ndevelop a predictive model for wildcat distribution in Portugal which, in view of the \n\napparent rareness (particularly in the south), elusive character, and similarity of signs of \n\npresence with the domestic counterpart, is a crucial tool to further develop a pro-active \n\nconservation strategy. Another important information gap is the role of human \n\ndisturbance, still poorly known due to its high complexity, mainly in relation with data \n\non wildcat direct persecution. Future, fine scale studies should focus on the aspects \n\n\n\n \n\n 175 \n\nrelated to human disturbance and direct killing, mostly associated with small game \n\nhunting practices (predator control practices). These aspects must be reflected in a large \n\nscale predictor that, in addition with those relate to wildcat requirements (food and \n\nshelter), contribute to built an predictive model to map potential distribution of wildcat \n\nin Iberia Peninsula.  \n\n \n\n7.4.
