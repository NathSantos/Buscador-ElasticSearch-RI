Este trabalho \u00e9 a primeira abordagem para estudar esta \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Atrav\u00e9s de petrografia, geoqu\u00edmica, qu\u00edmica mineral e difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios X, \n\neste trabalho p\u00f4de abordar os principais aspectos geol\u00f3gicos e mineral\u00f3gicos da Su\u00edte \n\nIntrusiva Ouro Fino e relacionar a qual mineral est\u00e3o constritos os ETR. Duas outras su\u00edtes \n\nintrusivas foram identificadas na regi\u00e3o: Su\u00edte Intrusiva S\u00e3o Domingos e Su\u00edte Intrusiva \n\nCosta Marques. Os dados geoqu\u00edmicos da Su\u00edte Intrusiva Ouro Fino definem-na como \n\nperalcalina, de car\u00e1ter alcalino a alcalino-c\u00e1lcico, e claramente, um granito intraplaca de \n\nsubtipo A2. Teores de \u00f3xido de elementos terras raras variaram de 0,47 a 1,65% nas \n\namostras analisados, prevalecendo o enriquecimento dos ETRL em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos pesados \n\n(Lan/Ybn ? 8). Junto com os ETR, teores >10.000 ppm de Zr foram identificados nessas \n\namostras. As an\u00e1lises de qu\u00edmica mineral e petrografia identificaram dois zirconossilicatos \n\nportadores de ETR: elpidita e zirc\u00e3o. A elpidita \u00e9 pervasiva em todas as amostras coletadas, \n\natigindo at\u00e9 5% da matriz, j\u00e1 o zirc\u00e3o ocorre ocupando pequenos interst\u00edcios da rocha. O \n\nzirc\u00e3o \u00e9 o mineral que mais cont\u00e9m ETR em sua estrutura, com teores de \u00f3xido de \n\nelementos terras raras entre 3.2% e 7,4%. Nas an\u00e1lises qu\u00edmicas da elpidita, os teores \n\ntotais de La2O3 + Ce2O3 + Y2O3 variaram de 0,21 a 1,92%. Como mineral acess\u00f3rio de \n\nETR, h\u00e1 titanita, com teores de \u00f3xidos de ETR no intervalo entre 1,07% e 3,53%. Por serem \n\nzirconossilicatos, os zirc\u00f5es analisados cont\u00eam teores de Zr variando entre 56,1 e 59,8% e \n\nos cristais de elpidita, est\u00e3o entre 18,9 e 21%. As su\u00edtes intrusivas \u00e0 Su\u00edte Intrusiva Ouro \n\nFino n\u00e3o representaram nenhum tipo de influ\u00eancia \u00e0 mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ETR-Zr. Os dados \n\npetrogr\u00e1ficos e de qu\u00edmica mineral mostram um enriquecimento de s\u00f3dio no sistema, \n\nmarcado por bordas de rea\u00e7\u00f5es no anfib\u00f3lio e albitiza\u00e7\u00e3o moderada dos feldspatos \n\npot\u00e1ssicos. Este hidrotermalismo s\u00f3dico gerou tamb\u00e9m enriquecimento de Ca em cristais \n\nprim\u00e1rios de elpidita. O fracionamento de ETR se deve \u00e0 incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos na \n\nestrutura dos zirconossilicatos e posteriormente precipita\u00e7\u00e3o por decr\u00e9scimo na \n\ntemperatura do sistema. Deste modo, a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da Su\u00edte Intrusiva Ouro Fino \n\ncaracteriza-se por um processo de autometassomatismo.

INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. Presentation and Objectives \n\nIn accord to the IUPAC, the Rare Earth Elements group is composed of the 15 \n\nlanthanides together with Y and Sc. However, the inclusion of Sc in this concept is still not \n\nhelpful, given the different behavior of Sc in nature (Wall, 2014). Also, the short-life of Pr \n\nmakes this element exceptionally rare in nature, resulting in a group of 15 REE elements, \n\ncomposed of 14 lanthanides plus Y (Wall, 2014). \n\nAs a result of the increasing demand for REE in the global markets and the REE \n\ntrade conditions imposed by China, the last decade became a period when several \n\nexploration projects for REE flourished (Paulick &amp; Machacek, 2017). Among the deposits \n\noutside China, the main projects are in Canada, Brazil, Greenland and Austr\u00e1lia.  \n\nBrazil has currently eight deposits of REE, being two associated with granitic rocks \n\nand six with alkaline-carbonatite complexes (Takehara et al, 2016). The alkaline-carbonatite \n\ncomplexes sum a total of 261.3 Mt of ore with REE2O3 in a range from 0.7% up to 5.5%, as \n\nwell the granitic REE deposits comprehend a total of 414 Mt of ore, being REE2O3 content \n\nequal or less than 1% (Takehara et al., 2016). The Rondonian Tin Province also contains in \n\nthe stanniferours greisens with REE mineralization associated (Bettencourt, 1988 and 1991; \n\nSouza, 2003; Sparrenberger, 2002; Buch et al., 2016). However, information about the ore \n\ngrades from these deposits is no quite precise. Among the REE ores associated with \n\ngranites described by Takehara, the one from Costa Marques was the least known. The \n\nREE occurrence of Costa Marques is related to the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (Buch et al, \n\n2018). \n\nThe existence of REE mineralization in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (OFIS) is \n\nknown since the project developed by Torres et al. (1978). After some mineral exploration \n\nfollow-up made by Costa (1990) in the area, nothing had been developed in the region \n\nanymore. Because of the strong demand for REE, new sources for these elements must be \n\nexplored. Therefore, some research to avail the potential of the OFIS for REE was required. \n\nThis project is the first investigation to comprehend the mineralization of Costa Marques. \n\nThe scope of this project comprises an integration of petrographic, petrological and \n\nmineralogical studies that aim to characterize the REE mineralization from the OFIS.  \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\n1.2. Location \n\nThe area of study locates in the southwestern border of the state of Rond\u00f4nia with \n\nBol\u00edvia. The reference city for support and logistic is Costa Marques. The access to Costa \n\nMarques is made from Porto Velho by the national highway BR-364 until the intersection \n\nwith the national highway BR-429, that ends in the city of Costa Marques. \n\nFrom Costa Marques to the study area, there are two entrances known as \u201ckm 22\u201d \n\nand \u201ckm 26\u201d. Counting from the city of Costa Marques, they respectively are 22 and 26 km \n\naway on the left side of the BR-429. The location of the study area is known in the region as \n\nSerra Grande Hill (Fig 1.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1: Planimetric location of the studied area. The area locates at the southwestern border of \nRondonia with Bolivia. Main accesses to the Ouro Fino Inrusive Suiute domain are in the intersection \nof the federal road with the km-22 and km-26 entrances. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n2. METHODOLOGY \n\n2.1. Mapping and Sampling \n\nFor the studies of this project, a field survey was made in the area during the second \n\nhalf of July 2016, in the dry season. A total of 42 spots were described and 29 samples had \n\nbeen collected. The location of sampling spots is in Appendix 2.  \n\nThe fieldwork data was compiled and interpreted in association with SRTM data \n\nprovided by the National Institute of Space Research and geophysical data provided from \n\nthe Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM, 2010). The result of this interpration is a geological \n\nmap in the 1:50,000 scale (Fig. 4.2). \n\n2.2. Geochemistry  \n\nThe chemical analyses for bulk-rock chemistry were executed by the ALS Global \n\nlaboratory in Brazil. From the 29 collected samples, only 18 samples did not present to be \n\nweathered to be chemically analysed. In the set of analysed samples, 13 are from the Ouro \n\nFino Intrusive Suite, 2 from the Sao Domingos Intrusive Suite and 3 from the Costa Marques \n\nIntrusive Suite. The location and type of the respective analysed samples are available in \n\nTable 8 of Appendix 2.  \n\nThe techniques applied to analyse major elements and ICP-AES with preparation \n\nand for trace and rare earth elements, ICP-MS. Samples were analysed in laboratory ALS \n\nGlobal, using the Service Packs ME-ICP06 for ICP-AES and ME-MS81 for REE and trace \n\nelements. Samples for ICP-AES were prepared using funded lithium borate beads with acid \n\ndigestion and for ICP-AES, the digestion was multiacid. More details about the analalytical \n\nproceeding can be found in the ALS-Global analytical schedule (ALS Global, 2018). \n\n2.3. Rock powder X-Ray Diffraction \n\nThe samples CM-31 and CM-39 were assayed under the technique X-ray \n\ndiffraction of rock powder. The analyses were performed by ALS Chemex laboratory using \n\na Bruker D8 Focus Bragg-Brentano diffractometer with a tube of cobalt. The range of 2? \n\nwas between 2\u00ba and 70\u00ba, with a theta step size of 0.1\u00ba and an analysis speed of 1.2 s per \n\nstep. The mineral composition was determined by the diffractometric results using the \n\nRietveld method. The X-Ray Diffraction analyitical package to identify bulk-rock mineralogy \n\nin ALS Global is known as XRDSQ (ALS Global, 2018) \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n2.4. Mineral Chemistry \n\nThe mineral chemistry analysis had been made over thin sections of 8 samples from \n\nriebeckite-alkali feldspar granites. To identify the minerals that contain REE elements, the \n\nchosen technique is the electron microprobe analyzer (EPMA). Among the 8 samples, the \n\nsamples were analyzed in the laboratory for electron microprobe analyzer from the German \n\nGeological Survey (BGR). The other 4 samples were analyzed in the laboratory for electron \n\nmicrobrobe of the Geosciences Institute of the University of Bras\u00edlia (LME-IG).  \n\nThe analyzed elements in the laboratory of electron microprobe of the BGR were \n\nNa, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe2+, Fe3+, Sr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Hf.  The targeted minerals \n\nwere amphiboles, pyroxenes, titanite, zircon, and elpidite. For the assays, a JEOL JXA-\n\n8530F was utilized. The analysis conditions occurred with a sample current of 40 nA and \n\nvoltage acceleration of 20kV.  The utilized lines are K? \u2013 Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, and K with \n\n10 s of peak measuring time; K? \u2013 Ti, with 20 s of peak measuring time; K? \u2013 Mn, with 30 s \n\nof peak measuring time; L? \u2013 Sr and Y, 30 s of peak measuring time; L? \u2013 Zr, with 60 s of \n\nmeasuring time; L? \u2013 La, with 60 s of measuring time; L? \u2013 Ce with 50 s of peak measuring \n\ntime and;  L? \u2013 Hf, with 50 s of peak measuring time. The standards utilized were diopside \n\n(Mg and Ca); jadeite (Al, Si, Na), rutile (Ti), rhodonite (Mn), almandine (Fe), orthoclase (K), \n\nsynthetic zirconia (Y, Hf), coelestine (Sr), zircon (Zr) and monazite (La, Ce).  \n\nIn the LME-IG, the utilized device was a JEOL JXA-8230. For the analyses, three different \n\nproceedings were developed. One was specific for (i) major elements on amphiboles and \n\npyroxenes, one was for (ii) major elements of potential REE minerals and the last, (iii) for \n\nREE elements on amphiboles, pyroxenes, and potential REE minerals. \n\n- (i) for the pyroxenes and amphiboles, the analysed elements are F, Al, Si, Ca, \n\nK, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Ni, Fe, V, and Ba.

SYNTHESIS OF REGIONAL GEOLOGY KNOWLEDGE  \n\n3.1. Geotectonic Context \n\nThe studied area situates at the extreme southwest border of the Amazonian \n\nCraton. In this region, the Amazonian Craton comprehends two geochronolocail provinces \n\n(Tassinari &amp; Macambira, 1999). The former, is the Rondonian-San Ignacio, with ages \n\nbetween 1.55 to 1.3 Ga and the subsequent, is the Suns\u00e1s Province, with ages between 1.3 \n\nto 1.0 Ga. Accordingly to Bettencourt et al. (2010), the Rondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio Province is \n\nbordered to the north and east by the Rio Negro-Juruena Province and to the south, is \n\nbounded by the Suns\u00e1s Province.  \n\nThe Rondonian-San Ignacio Province comprises a geological set resulted from an \n\norogeny involving the amalgamation of the Paragu\u00e1 Terrane to other domains composed by \n\nthe Rio Crespo Intrusive Suite (1.5 Ga), Rio Alegre Complex (1.51 \u2013 1.48), Santa Helena \n\nbatholith (1.45 \u2013 1.42 Ga), Colorado Metamorphic Complex (1.36 \u2013 1.3 Ga) and \n\nPensamiento Granitoid Complex (1.36 \u2013 1.30 Ga) (Cordani &amp; Teixeira, 2007; Bettencourt et \n\nal., 2010) . \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nIn accord with the map of Rizzotto et al., (2013) the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is \n\ninserted in the Guapor\u00e9 Suture Zone (Fig. 3.1). The Guapor\u00e9 Suture is the result of the \n\namalgamation of the Paragu\u00e1 Terrane with the Amazonian Craton (Rizzotto et al., (2013). \n\nThe evolution of this suture zone included the generation of ultramafic magmatism followed \n\nthe deformation of oceanic crust and supracrustal rocks and granitogeneses during the \n\ncollisional phase (Rizzotto et al., 2013). The Trincheira Complex represents the ophiolitic \n\ncrust formed between 1470 and 1435 Ma and the Colorado Metamorphic Complex is the \n\nsupracrustal rocks group deposited over the Trincheira Complex. The metamorphism of the \n\nColorado Metamorhic Complex took place around 1350 to 1330 Ma. \n\nOccurying in the centre-north of Rondonia, the intrusive suites Santo Ant\u00f4nio (1,41 \n\nGa), Teot\u00f4nio (1.39 Ga), Alto Candeias (1.34 Ga) and S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o-Caripunas (1.3 Ga) \n\nwere associated to late to post-tectonic magmatism related to the Rondonian-San Ignacio \n\n(Bettencourt et al., 2010). \n\nWithin the Guapor\u00e9 Suture Zone, Rizzotto (2010) present two intrusive suites of \n\nages around 1.3 \u2013 1.4 Ga. The Igarap\u00e9 Enganado (1.36 Ga) and Alto Escondido (1.34) \n\nintrusive suites are the result of late to post-colisional magmatism inside the Guapor\u00e9 Suture \n\nZone. The plutonism of these suites is correlated to the plutonism resulted from the \n\nRondonian-San Ignacio events in other regions of Rondonia (Gilmar Jos\u00e9 Rizzotto, 2010). \n\nThe Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite was only recently discovered (Bettencourt et al., \n\n2012). For several years, the only dated magmatism in the studied area was from the Costa \n\nMarques Group, around 1.0 Ga (Torres et al., 1979). The magmatism of the Costa Marques \n\nGroup was associated with the Sunsas Geochronoligical Province and correlate to the \n\nRondonian Intrusive Suite, both result of post-collisional plutonism (Quadros &amp; Rizzotto, \n\n2007). Since new data have been presented, new interpreations are necessary to come. \n\nHowever, there is still no work interpreting the origin of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nmagmatism face the regional deformatinal events of the Rondonian-San Ignacio Province. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1: Location of the studied area in the regional geological context. The area is located within the \nGuapor\u00e9 Suture Zone in accord to Rizzotto et al. (2013). Figure adapted from Rizzotto et al. (2013). \n\n3.2. Previous Works \n\nThe first reports about the geology of the region were written by Lobato  et al. (1966). \n\nSubsequently, the projects Southwest of Rond\u00f4nia (Torres, 1979) and the RADAM Brasil \u2013 \n\nQuadricule Guapor\u00e9 SD.20 (Santos et al., 1979) developed recognisement studies in the \n\nregion. The former was on 1:500,000 scale and the last, 1: 1,000,000.  \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nDuring the 1980\u2019s, the Geological Survey of Brazil, formely called CPRM, developed \n\nstudies to identify areas with metalogenetic potential (Freitas et al., 1985). Afterwards, Costa \n\n(1990) developed an exploration survey for REE in the Serra Grande Hill, which is the work \n\nthat identifies the potential for REE in the Serra Grande Hill. \n\nOther studies improved the knowledge about the geological background in the area \n\n(Scandolara,1999; Rizzotto et al., 2004; Quadros &amp; Rizzotto, 2007). However, these works \n\nwere developed on a regional scale and did not discuss specifically the granitic rocks from \n\nthe southwestern border of Rondonia State. \n\nNot long ago, Bettencourt et al. (2012) redefined the framework of the granites from \n\nCosta Marques. As well other further studies regarding the lithogeochemistry and Hf- \n\nisotopes geochemistry of granites from Costa Marques were published recently (PayollaI et \n\nal., 2013; Bettencourt et al., 2014).  \n\n3.3. Regional Geology \n\nInitially, the most ancient rocks in the region were defined by Torres et al. (1979) \n\nand Santos et al. (1979). However, the following studies on the regional background of \n\nScandolara (1999) and Quadros &amp; Rizzotto (2007) contradicted the proposed ages and \n\ntectonic events that occurred in this region at the beginning and end of the Neoproterozoic. \n\nWith the airborne geophysical surveys contracted by the CPRM and the \n\ngeochronological analyzes published in other articles, it became possible to advance the \n\nunderstanding of the tectonic limits in the studied region. In this way, the units will be \n\ndescribed in the sequence of the most recent stratigraphy, but the older terms will be \n\nmentioned since the basement rocks in this part of the state of Rond\u00f4nia still need more \n\ndetailed geochronological studies. \n\n3.3.1. Colorado Metamorphic Complex \n\nThe Colorado Metamorphic Complex (CMC) is an association of \n\nmetavulcanosedimentary rocks by Rizzotto et al. (2007) near Colorado do Oeste - RO. \n\nAccording to the authors, this association of rocks is subdivided into four lithophacities: \n\nMetapelitic Unit, Metapsytic Unit, Iron-Manganese Unit and Calcissilictic Unit. The existence \n\nof these rocks as a basement of the studied area is defined by Quadros &amp; Rizzotto (2007) \n\nand was defined through the interpretation of tectonic limits interpreted from \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\naerogeophysical data. Torres et al. (1979) called the metamorphic rocks intruded by the \n\nformer Costa Marques Complex as Serra dos Reis Unit. Hence, in order to seek a \n\nconcordance that eliminates this hiatus on the geological knowledge, the subdivisions of the \n\nColorado Complex defined by Rizzotto et al. 2007) will be described and followed by the \n\nSerra dos Reis Unit mentioned by Torres et al. (1979). According to Rizzotto et al. (2007), \n\nthe CMC rocks were formed in a regional metamorphic event, of medium amphibolite facies \n\n3.3.1.1. Metapelitic Unity \n\nThe metapelitic unit of the Colorado Metamorphic Complex is formed by elongated \n\nand sigmoidal lenses of metric length or, that could reach up to 25 km. The lithotypes that \n\ncompose it are muscovite-biotite-quartz schists, granada-silimanite-biotite schists, \n\nsilimanite-staurolite-biotite schists, silimanite-staurolite-biotite-quartz schists and locally, \n\ngraphite-schists. Cutting these rocks, there are veins of quartz with blasts of subhedral \n\nmuscovite. \n\nThe fabric of these rocks contrives a crenulated schistosity, indicating at least two \n\ndeformations. The mesoscopic-scale crenulations are indicated by isoclinal and intrafolial \n\nfolds, with or without roots. \n\nHosted in these rocks, there are pockets of granitic composition (neosomas) parallel \n\nto sigmoid schistosity. Porphyroblasts of aluminous minerals such as grenade and \n\nsubordinately staurolite are common and have their origin possibly associated with contact \n\nmetamorphism. As well, there are porphyroblasts of grenade parallell to the main foliation. \n\n3.3.1.2. Metapsamitic Unity \n\nThis unit is composed by migmatitic gneisses and occurs interbedded with the \n\nmetapelitics and paraderivated units. The migmatization is indicated by pods and lenses of \n\ngranitic leucosoma (neosoma). The neosome lenses are concordant with the \n\nbanding/foliation of gneisses. The petrography indicates that the origins of these gneisses \n\nare from pure and impure sandstones (metarkoses). The sillimanite and cordierite of these \n\nrocks indicate high grade metamorphism. \n\nThe felsic layers vary between 1.0 and 1.5 mm in thickness and the mafic layers \n\nvary between 1.0 and 3.0 mm. These layers have isoclinal and intrafolial folds with root, \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\ndefined by the folding of aggregates of biotite and sillimanite; thus indicating at least two \n\ndeformations. \n\n3.3.1.3. Ferro-Manganesiferous Unity \n\nThe occurrence of this unit is irregular and discontinuous. The foliation is parallel to \n\nthe foliation of the units mentioned above. This unit is composed of layers of metacherts \n\nintercalated with layers of iron and manganese oxides. Among these layers, there may be \n\namphibolites, schists and associated paragneisses. The most frequent lithotypes are \n\nmagnetite-metachert, hematite-quartzite and ferruginous quartzite. These layers of silica \n\nand oxides of iron and manganese have thicknesses ranging from millimeters to \n\ncentimeters. \n\n3.3.1.4. Calcissilicatic Unity \n\nDiscontinuous lenses of calcissilicatic gneiss are generally intercalated with \n\namphibolites. They have a constricted to the extreme northwest of Pimenteiras city. The \n\nconstituent minerals are diopside, plagioclase, quartz and, to a lesser extent, granade. \n\nThese minerals are segregated in layers of millimetric thickness, defining the foliation of the \n\nrock. \n\n3.3.1.5. Paramphibolite Unity \n\nThis unit is associated with calcissilictic gneisses and occurs as narrow and \n\nelongated layers of very local occurrence. It is dark gray in color and fine grained. The fabric \n\nis composed of centimetri-decimetric layers of amphibole texture nematoblastic cut by \n\nquartz venules parallel to the foliation. According to Rizzotto et al. (2007), the CMC rocks \n\nwere formed in a regional metamorphic event, of medium amphibolite facies. \n\n3.3.1.6. The Serra dos Reis Unity \n\nAs mentioned previously, Quadros &amp; Rizzotto (2007) defined the Colorado \n\nMetamorphic Complex as the country rock for the granites of Costa Marques.  Concordant \n\nto these authors, the Colorado Metamorphc Complex is the same group of metamorphic \n\nrocks denominated Serra dos Reis Unity, by Torres et al. (1978).  \n\nTorres describes the Serra dos Reis Unity as na elongated hill striking E-W, at NE \n\nof Costa Marques city. It occurs also as inselbergs in the Guapor\u00e9 River\u2019s flood plain. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nThe Serra dos Reis Unity is formed byt metarenites, metarkoses, and quartzites. \n\nLocally, there are conglomeratic meta-arkoses, fine-grained metarenites and purple phylites \n\n(Torres et al., 1979).  \n\nTorres et al. suggest the probable age for the Serra dos Reis Unity is between 1.8 \n\nand 1.5 Ga. However, Scandolara (1999) infers that the Serra dos Reis Unity could be part \n\nof the Nova Brasil\u00e2ndia Metavolcanosedimentary Sequence, with age of 1.177\u00b133 Ma \n\n(Rb/Sr bulk rock). In accord with Rizzotto et al. (2010), the Colorado Metamorphic Complex \n\nhas ages between 1312\u00b13Ma and 1303\u00b12Ma (Ar/Ar in biotite of anatexites).  \n\nFor the description of the Colorado Metamorphic Complex and its correlate Serra \n\ndos Reis Unity, its assumed that the Serra dos Reis Unity corresponds to the metapsamitic \n\nunity of Rizzotto et al. (2007). \n\n3.3.2. Costa Marques Complex: three alkaline intrusive su\u00edtes \n\nThe first mention of Costa Marques granites was made by Lobato et al. (1966), while \n\nreporting rocks near the Pr\u00edncipe da Beira Fortress The authors describe rocks with \n\nporphyritic texture and probably mineralized to cassiterite. Santos et al. (1978) define as \n\nCosta Marques Group porphyritic granites and as well, rhyolites, andesites, tufts, porphyry \n\nquartz, granites and granophyres, that appear near the homonymous region. According to \n\nthese authors, \"lithotypes are extremely differentiated going mainly from acid to \n\nintermediate, as well as some mafic local exposures. Santos et al. (1978) reportes the most \n\ncomplete description of the rocks associate to the Costa Marques Group, which is \n\nsummarized below:     \n\n3.3.2.1. Granites \n\nGranites are the most abundant lithotypes in the Costa Marques Group. They are \n\nof phaneritic texture, generally medium to coarse grained, sometimes porphyritic. The \n\ngranites present brown, pink and gray coloration, and sometimes presenting dark or \n\ngreenish spots and a leucocratic color index. \n\nIn micropetrography, there is micropertitic intergrowth in the feldspars (hypersolvus). \n\nThe habit of these crystals is anhedral to subhedral, occurring Albite or Carlsbad twinnings. \n\nThe quartz crystals are of anhedral, with fractured edges, and sometimes with undulating \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nextinction. Myrmequite intergrowth between quartz crystals and feldspars is another \n\ncommon feature. \n\nThe biotite crystals vary from green to brown, with strong pleochroism. These \n\ncrystals are distributed in lamellae and replace the hornblende. Inclusions of zircon are rare. \n\nThe amphibole occurs in two varieties, hornblende and biotite. The hornblende is of \n\ntabular form, with euhedral crystals. Riebeckite occurs as tabular crystals or sub-radiated \n\naggregates of very small prisms. These crystals are intensely pleochroic, with the color \n\nvarying from dark blue to yellowish green. Other minerals that make up the rock are opaque \n\nand titanite anhedral, zircon in tiny euhedral prisms, fluorite, alannite in more developed \n\neuhedral crystals and apatite. As altering minerals occupying mainly fractures, there are \n\nsericite, leucoxene, clay-minerals, chlorite, epidote-zoisite and iron oxides. \n\n3.3.2.2. Granophyres \n\nIn accord to Santos et al. (1978), the granophyres are rocks with \"pinkish-gray\u201d \n\ncoloration, porphyritic texture with a microphaneritic matrix. The rock has a massive \n\nstructure and is consisted essentially of quartz, feldspar, epidote or mafic mineralss. \n\nUnder the microscope, not all the samples studied by these authors revealed \n\nphenocrysts. These samples without phenocrysts showed a microfaneritic texture, with an \n\nincipient finer granulation than porphyritic granophyres. Feldspar phenocrysts can reach 2.5 \n\ncm length and form clusters resulting in a glomeroporphyrytic texture. Opaque minerals are \n\nabundant and appear as altered or disseminated mineral clusters in the matrix. As accessory \n\nminerals, there are apatite and zircon in the form of small euhedral crystals. Rarely, there is \n\nbiotite, which is sometimes chloritized. \n\nThe alteration minerals are chlorite and epidote. The chlorite occurs in the form of \n\nlamellar and fibrorradial aggregates; and the epidote in small crystal agglomerates.  \n\n3.3.2.3. Syenytes \n\nSyenites are scarce in the Costa Marques Group. They are coloured brown, \n\nmedium-coarse grained, and are essentially composed of orthoclase, microcline, \n\nplagioclase and hornblende. In micropetrography, it is possible to observe cataclastic \n\ndeformation in the crystals with undulating extinction, marginal microgranulation (generation \n\nof subgrains), curved geminations and mineral comminution with faceted subgrains. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n3.3.2.4. Rhyolites \n\nRhyolites are of reddish-brown to yellow-brown coloration, with fine granulation, \n\nporphyritic texture with matrix varying from aphanitic to microphaneritic. The constituent \n\nminerals are mainly quartz and K-feldspar. \n\nIn micropetrography, phenocrysts of feldspar and quartz vary from anhedral to \n\neuhedral are surrounded by a spherulitic matrix composed of feldspar and fibroradiated \n\ncristobalite. In the matrix, there are also opaque minerals, epidote and chlorite. The quartz \n\nphenocrystalls present corroded edges. Feldspars present Albite and Carlsbad twinnings. \n\nPerttitic intergrowth is observed as a result of the occurrence of plagioclase associated with \n\npotassic feldspar. As accessory minerals, there are zircon and titanite. \n\n3.3.2.5. Rhyodacites and tuffs \n\nThese rocks are the most abundant of the Costa Marques Group, in accord to \n\nSantos et al. (1978). The rhyodacites present greenish gray colours, with porphyritic texture, \n\naphanitic matrix and massive structure. \n\nUnder the microscope, the phenocrystalls are mostly feldspar (microcline and \n\nplagioclase) and subordinately, clinopyroxene. These phenocrysts are immersed in a fine-\n\ngrained matrix composed essentially of quartz and feldspars. In addition, the matrix is also \n\ncomposed of chlorite, epidote, opaque minerals and more rarely, volcanic glass.  When \n\nassociated with K-feldspar, plagioclase occurs micropertitic intergrowth. \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrystalls are anhedrical sometimes altered to epidote or \n\nchlorite. Quartz crystals form an intergrowth with the feldspars. Eventually, there is still \n\ncryptocrystalline silica in the form of spherulites also associated with feldspars. Opaque \n\nminerals are quite numerous, in the form of tiny disseminated crystals or aggregates. \n\nTitanite, zircon and apatite are in trace quantities. Chlorite and epidote occur in large \n\namounts possibly resulted from alteration processes. \n\nThe rhyodacitic tuff under naked eye is a rock of dark gray color, porphyritic texture \n\nand aphanitic matrix with massive structure. Its main constituents are mafic minerals, \n\nfeldspar and quartz. In the microscope, there are fragments of basaltic rock and phenocrysts \n\nof quartz and feldspar. The matrix consists of feldspar, quartz and volcanic glass. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n3.3.2.6. Trachytes \n\nThe trachytes exhibit gray color, with porphyritic texture and aphanitic matrix. Are \n\ncomposed essentially by mafic minerals and K-feldpsar. In microscopic scale, the K- \n\nfeldspar (orthoclase), is scattered in the matrix beside aegirine crystals. The main \n\nphenocrysts are the orthoclase with pertitic intergrowth. As for accessories, the rock \n\npresents opaque minerals, zircon, titanite, quartz and apatite.  \n\n3.3.2.7. Andesites \n\nQuite common, in the Group Costa Marques, the andesites prevail over \n\nleucoandesitos. The color varies from pink to dark gray, and the colour index varies from \n\nleucocratic to melanocratic. The texture is usually unequigranular, with aphanitic matrix and \n\nfeldspar phenocrysts. Less frequent are the rocks with aphanitic or fine phaneritic textures. \n\nThe main constituent minerals are plagioclase, biotite and amphibole. \n\nIn the micropetrography, feldspars are predominantly identified as plagioclase, \n\nwhich is moderately sericitized, with antipertitites, subhedral habit, and Albite and Carlsbad-\n\ntype geminations. The identified member of the plagioclase series is andesine. In the matrix \n\nthere is also chlorite, resulted from the biotite and hornblende alteration. Quartz when \n\nobserved, is of anhedral habit and undulating extinction. Minerals identified accessories are \n\nopaque minerals, zircon, apatite, titanite, epitope and subordinately rutile. \n\n3.3.2.8. Reclassifications and Geological Knowledge Update  \n\nAfter Santos et al. (1978), Torres et al. (1978) defined the Costa Marques Group as \n\nCosta Marques Complex, a denomination that has been preserved until the work of \n\nBettencourt et al. (2012). These authors subdivided the Costa Marques Complex into three \n\ndistinct magmatic suites: two plutonic and one subvolcanic. Concordant to Bettencourt et al. \n\n(2012), the first plutonic suite contrives gray aegirina-augita-riebeckita quartz-syenites and \n\nalkali-feldspar granites. The second plutonic suite characterized by Bettencourt et al. (2012) \n\nis composed of pink-coloured hornblende-biotite sienogranites with medium to coarse \n\ngranulation and porphyritic or seriate textures and, gray biotite alkali-feldspar granites of \n\nfine-medium granulation. Still, according to those authors, the subvolcanic suite features \n\nhornblende-porphyrus porphyry and hornblende porphyry rhyolites, with banded or massive \n\nstructures. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nThese suites were named by Bettencourt et al. (2012) as Intrusive Suite S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos, Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, with the concept of Costa Marques Suites, just a sub-\n\nsuite. Payolla et al. (2013) classified these suites as alkaline-alkali suites, alkaline to \n\nmetaluminous, and sodium and potassium affinity. According to these authors, the intrusive \n\nsuites have geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. \n\nThe first ages of the Costa Marques Group were obtained by Santos et al. (1979), \n\nas providing an isochron of Rb/Sr with an age of 962 \u00b1 72 Ma, in bulk rock analysis. This \n\nage off the Costa Marques Group to be correlated to the magmatism of the Rond\u00f4nia \n\nIntrusive Suite. Much later, Bettencourt et al. (2012) analyzed U/Pb in zircons through \n\nSHRIMP technique and obtained three distinct ages, what resulted in the discrimination of \n\nthree magmatic suites of the region. These authors conclude that the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite is the earliest, with 1347 \u00b1 9Ma. The S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite is the subsequent \n\nmagmatism with an age of 1057 \u00b1 10 Ma and, lastly, the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite with \n\nan age of 998 \u00b1 10 Ma. \n\n3.3.3. Guapor\u00e9 Formation \n\nAlthough of wide extension (Quadros &amp; Rizzotto, 2007), the Cenozoic sedimentary \n\nand lateritic covers are little discriminated against each other in previous studies. In general, \n\nthe cenozoic covers are associated with the geomorphological landscape of the Guapor\u00e9 \n\nRiver Valley. The Guapor\u00e9 Formation comprises unconsolidated sediments deposited in the \n\nalluvial plain of the homonymous river (Figueiredo et al.,1974, apud Santos et al., 1978). \n\nThese authors correlate the Guapor\u00e9 Formation with the Pantanal Formation, in the state of \n\nMato Grosso, and divide it into two subtypes: lower and higher. \n\nThe lower level is determined as \"unconsolidated lateritized clayish-arenous \n\nsediments\u201d that occur in the non-flooded part of the plain. However, Torres et al. (1978) \n\nobserved that the lateritization processes are much more prominent and describe \n\nferruginous crusts with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 40 meters. These laterites are \n\ngenerally with continuous horizons with concretionary and/or pisolithic matrix. \n\nThe upper layer comprises the layers of sediment still depositing at the adjacent to \n\nthe Guapor\u00e9 River rails and its tributaries channels. According to Torres et al. (1978), this \n\nupper layers form terraces on the banks of the rivers of the region, or islands or sand banks. \n\nThese authors observe that the types of sediments are variable, existing clay with or without \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\norganic matter to coarse gravel. These characteristics are typical of meandering river \n\nenvironments. \n\nTorres et al. (1978) propose a more consistent discrimination by differentiating the \n\nupper level in two groups of sedimentary deposits.

Abstract \n\n The alkaline granites of the southwest of southwest Rondonia, Brazil are known for high \n\nconcentrations of REE. This study is the first approach to understand the REE mineralization of the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite. This suite is composed of a hypersolvus peralkaline alkali feldspar granite. \n\nThe mafic minerals are essentially sodic amphiboles and pyroxenes. Petrographical results indicate \n\nlittle mineralogical variation within the alkali feldspar granites. Associated with the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite, late-magmatic alkali-rhyolite dykes occur. Unexpectedly, other plutonic rocks from Costa \n\nMarques and S\u00e3o Domingos intrusive suites occur in the studied local. The geochemical data \n\nidentified total rare earth contents in the whole rock ranging from 0.47 up to 1.65%, and average \n\nLan/Ybn ? 8. Also, high contents of Zr were identified in all the samples, eventually exceeding the \n\nupper limit of detection. The mineral chemistry results in EPMA identified zircon and elpidite as the \n\nmain carriers of Zr and REE, and subordinately, titanite. The borders of amphiboles are rimmed by \n\naegirine. As well, small crystals of Na-plagioclase formed on the edges of microcline crystals, which \n\nsuggests that late magmatic processes occurred. The elpidite is considered as one of the minerals \n\nthat incorporated Ca ions during hydrothermal-deuteric processes. Zircon crystals show a mantle of \n\namorphous cryptocrystalline mass rich in REE. The other intrusive suites that occur in the area \n\npresented no characteristic that could be regarded to the mineralization. The REE-Zr mineralization \n\nis considered as a result of late-magmatic hydrothermal metasomatism followed by the cooling of \n\nthe hydrothermal system. The incorporation of REE in the lattice of zirconsilicates is the main \n\nconcentration factor as well, as REE concentrated by precipitation in the interstices of the rock. The \n\nREE-Zr mineralization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suites present mineralogical and petrological \n\ncharacteristics similar to the Strange Lake and Khan Bogd deposits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Zirconosilicates; peralkaline granites; REE; Rondonia; Amazonian Craton. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n4.2. Introduction \n\nIn the last 25 years, the importance of rare-earth elements (REE) staggered. Being \n\nessential to the technology industry, the REE deposits became strategic, which resulted in \n\na rush for new deposits. Several deposits of REE have been associated with alkaline \n\ngranites and within-plate geological setting (Wall, 2014; Dostal et al, 2017; \n\nChakhmouradian and Zaitsev, 2012). The Rond\u00f4nia State, in western Brazil, hosts several \n\nREE-anomalous alkaline granitic suites, which may contain Sn, W, Nb-Ta and F \n\nmineralization and gemstones (Isotta et al. 1978, Betencourt et al. 1999, Quadros and \n\nRizzotto, 2007). The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is located on the southwest side of the \n\nRond\u00f4nia State, very close to the border between Brazil and Bolivia (Fig. 4.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: Location of the area of study and the vicinal geologyt. Figure extracted from Payolla et \nal. (2013) and adapted for this work. \n\nIt has an alkaline geochemical signature and displays REE enrichments (Freitas et \n\nal. 1985). The later characteristic led to detailed research on the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nthrough an exploration project with soil and rock sampling conducted by the Geological \n\nSurvey of Brazil - CPRM (Costa, 1990). The exploration survey executed by the CPRM \n\nindicated \u201cfrequent geochemical anomalies of Y, La, Zr and Ti\u201d (Costa, 1990). Lately, a study \n\nof revaluation of soil samples and airborne geophysical modelling (Buch et al., 2018) \n\nidentified anomalous contents of La, Nd, Yb and Y in the soil and a positive correlation of \n\nthis anomalies with U and Th detected in aerogeophysical surveys. This study has inferred \n\nthe Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as a high potential to become a REE deposit. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nIn this paper, we present new data about petrography, geochemistry and REE-\n\nmineralogy features of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, aiming to advance in the petrological \n\ninvestigation on this new target for REE in the Amazonian craton, Brazil.  \n\n4.3. Geological Setting \n\nThe State of Rond\u00f4nia, located on the SW border of the Amazonian Craton, Brazil, \n\nhosts several Meso- to Neoproterozoic alkaline (A-type) granitic complexes, representing \n\nA-type and within-plate to post-collisional geochemical signatures, which were emplaced \n\nduring successive magmatic episodes that occurred between 1,606 and 974 Ma (Priem et \n\nal., 1971, Isotta et al., 1978, Bettencourt et al., 1999, Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007). Close \n\nto the southwest border of the Rond\u00f4nia State, three A-type granite associations were \n\ndiscriminated in recent studies (Bettencourt et al, 2012): Ouro Fino, S\u00e3o Domingos and \n\nCosta Marques intrusive suites. The available data place the Colorado Metamorphic \n\nComplex as the regional basement (Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007) for those rocks. \n\n4.3.1. Colorado Metamorphic Complex \n\nColorado Metamorphic Complex is a metasedimentary sequence, formed by \n\nmetapelitic, metapsammitic, meta-sandstones and meta-arkoses, ferrous-manganesiferous \n\nand calcissilicatic rocks (Rizzotto et al., 2007). Subordinately occur meta-conglomerates and \n\nphyllites (Torres et al, 1979; Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007). The Colorado Metamorphic \n\nComplex is the supracrustal set of rocks associated with the Alto Guapor\u00e9 fold belt, an \n\norogeny correlated to the Rondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio Province (Rizzotto et al., 2014; \n\nBettencourt et al., 2010).  \n\n4.3.2. The Three Alkaline Intrusive Suites  \n\nThe Costa Marques Complex (Torres et al. 1978) was first named as Costa Marques \n\nGranite (Lobato 1966) and later named as Costa Marques Group (Santos et al. 1978). It is \n\ncomposed of porphyritic granites, rhyolites, andesites, tuffs, quartz porphyries, granites and \n\ngranophyres. According to Bettencourt et al. (2012), the Costa Marques Complex can be \n\ndivided into three alkaline granitic suites: two plutonic and one subvolcanic. The oldest \n\nplutonic suite is composed of aegirine-augite-riebeckite quartz-syenites and alkali feldspar \n\ngranites. The second plutonic suite is composed hornblende-biotite syenogranites with \n\nmedium-coarse grained matrix and porphyritic to seriate texture. The subvolcanic suite \n\npresents porphyritic hornblende-trachyte and hornblende-rhyolites. These suites were \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\ndenominated by Bettencourt et al. (2012) as Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nIntrusive Suites and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, respectively. From the former Costa \n\nMarques Complex, for Costa Marques Intrusive Suite remained only the volcanic lithotypes. \n\nPayolla et al. (2013) classified these three igneous suites as an alkali to alkali-calcic, \n\nperalkaline to metaluminous, with sodium-potassic affinity. In consonance with these \n\nauthors, the three igneous suites of Costa Marques feature geochemical characteristics of \n\nA-type granites. \n\nThe first geochronological data for the former Costa Marques Complex were \n\nobtained by Santos et al. (1979), which provided an isochronous of Rb/Sr at the age of 962 \n\n\u00b1 72 Ma. With this age, the authors correlated the Costa Marques magmatism to the \n\nRondonia Intrusive Suite magmatism (\u201cYoung Granites of Rond\u00f4nia\u201d). Long after, \n\nBettencourt et al. (2012) obtained new ages by analyzing U/Pb in zircons using the SHRIMP \n\nmethod. The results yield three different ages, permitting to discriminate three magmatic \n\nsuites in the region. These authors conclude that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is older, with \n\n1347 \u00b1 9 Ma, the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite is the subsequent magmatism at the age of \n\n1057 \u00b1 10 Ma and finally, the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite at the age of 998 \u00b1 10 Ma. \n\nCoeval to the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite magmatism were two other important \n\nregional events: the magmatism of the Alto Candeias Intrusive Suite and the metamorphic \n\npeak of the Guapor\u00e9 Fold Belt (Rizzotto et al., 2013). The Alto Candeias batholith is a \n\nsubalkaline suite composed of amphibole-biotite syenogranites, biotite-syenogranites and \n\nsome charnockites (Bettencourt et al., 1999). According to Bettencourt et al. (1999), U-Pb \n\nin zircos yielded ages between 1346 \u00b1 5 and 1309 \u00b1 9 Ma, which are correlated to \u201can \n\nextensional regime related to Rondonian-San Ignacio orogeny or to the opening of the \n\nGreenvillian ocean\u201d. In the Guapor\u00e9 Fold Belt, Rizzotto et al., (2013) obtained 207Pb/206Pb \n\nages analysing zircons from a coarse-grained porphyritic monzogranite of the Igarap\u00e9 \n\nEnganado Intrusive Suite. The Concordia age of 1340 \u00b1 5 Ma from this suite is correlated to \n\nthe peak of metamorphism and deformation in the Guapor\u00e9 Suture.  \n\n4.3.3. Guapor\u00e9 Formation \n\nFigueiredo et al (1974, in Santos et al., 1978) define as Guapor\u00e9 Formation the \n\ngroup of sediments, consolidated or not, deposited in the flood plain of the Guapor\u00e9 River. \n\nTorres et al (1978) report intense laterization processes, with lateritic crusts up to 40 meters \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nin height. Two members were determined to the Guapor\u00e9 Formation, being the former \n\n(inferior) the eluvial-colluvial sediments originated from the erosion of the Serra dos \n\nUopianes hills and the second (superior), the fluvial sediments associated to the present \n\nrivers in the region (Torres et al., 1978). \n\n4.4. Methodology \n\nFieldwork surveys for sampling were performed during the Amazonian summer. For \n\nthis study, 18 rock samples were analysed. The bulk-rock chemistry was determined by \n\ngeochemical analyses performed in the laboratory ALS Global using ICP-AES analyses \n\n(Service Pack ME-ICP06 \u2013 ALS Global, 2018) or major oxides chemistry and ICP-MS \n\n(Service Pack ME-MS81 \u2013 ALS Global, 2018) analyses for trace and rare earth elements. \n\nThe samples for ICP-AES assays were prepared on a fused bead with posterior acid \n\ndigestion. The analytes for the analyses of ICP-MS were prepared using lithium borate \n\nfusion and four acid digestion.  \n\nThe petrographic studies were supported by mineralogical XRD analyses, also \n\ndeveloped by ALS Global (Service Pack XRDSQ \u2013 ALS Global, 2018).  \n\nThe samples CM-31 and CM-39 were assayed under the technique X-ray diffraction \n\nof rock powder. The analyses were performed by ALS Global laboratory using a Bruker D8 \n\nFocus Bragg-Brentano diffractometer with a tube of cobalt. The range of 2? was between 2\u00ba \n\nand 70\u00ba, with a theta step size of 0.1\u00ba and an analysis speed of 1.2 s per step. The mineral \n\ncomposition was determined by the diffractometric results using the Rietveld method. \n\nElectronic Microprobe Analyses (EPMA) were performed on six samples, partly at the \n\nFederal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) and at the Laboratory for \n\nMicroprobe at the Institute for Geosciences of the University of Bras\u00edlia (LM-IG-UnB). The \n\nsamples CM-20, CM-28B, CM-31 and CM-39 were analysed by BGR, with given results for \n\nNa, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Sr, Y, Zr, La, Ce and Hf. In the (LM-IG-UnB), the samples \n\nCM-04 and CM-20 were analysed in three different proceedings: (i) \u2013 silicates, aiming to \n\nanalyse Na, Mg, F, Al, Si, Ca, K, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Ni, Fe, V and Ba;  REE, with results for \n\nREE + Na, K, Sr, Pb, Th, U and Ba; (ii) \u2013 major elements, with results for F, Al, Si, Hf, Nb, \n\nP, Ti, Mn, Y, Ta, Ca, Zr and Fe and (iii) \u2013 REE, with results for REE + Na, K, Sr, Pb, Th, U \n\nand Ba. The two former analysis stages were performed to determine the mineral, being the \n\nfirst for silicate minerals (e.g. arfvedsonite) and the second on potential hosts for REE (e.g. \n\nzircon). The third proceeding was performed to determine REE content in the analysed \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nminerals. The analytical parameters used for the EPMA analyses are in the Appendix I. The \n\ngeological map presented in this work (Fig. 2) was supported by fieldwork data integrated \n\nwith geophysical data from Buch et al. (2018) and CPRM (2010). \n\n4.5. Field and Petrographic Aspects \n\nThe area of study comprises the locally known Serra Grande hill and its vicinities. \n\nThe Serra Grande hill is a very pronounced elevation on the Guapor\u00e9 flood plain, 25 km \n\nNNW of the city of Costa Marques, elongated in NW-SE direction, 10 km in length and 2 km \n\nwide. Around the hill, there is a wide plain with little morphological changes.  \n\nThe Serra Grande hill represents mainly the outcrop of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nand during this study, it was discovered that the S\u00e3o Domingos and Costa Marques intrusive \n\nsuites also outcrop in the area (Fig. 4.2). Around the Serra Grande Hill, there are lateritic \n\ncrusts and the clastic deposits from the Guapor\u00e9 Formation. Locally also alluvial and \n\ncolluvial clastic deposits occur which are related to the current depositional dynamic \n\nenvironment. \n\n4.5.1. Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nThe Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is a massive stock domaining the area of the Serra \n\nGrande Hill. Other small plutons in the NW of Costa Marques also occur in the same \n\ndirectional trend (Fig 4.1). The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is covered by scattered vegetation \n\nand is covered on its borders by laterites (Fig 4.3.a). The outcrops are usually big exposure \n\nof rocks, though, given the tropical climate, the rocks present variable degrees of weathering \n\n(Fig 4.3.b).  \n\nBettencourt et al. (2012) define the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as aegirine-augite-\n\nriebeckite quartz syenites and alkali feldspar granites. In this study, these lithotypes are \n\nfound in almost all the Serra Grande Hill, and the granite subfacies are differentiated mainly \n\nby texture. In mesoscopic scale, the granitoids are gray to pinkish gray, with a phaneritic \n\nseriate to the equigranular texture that varies from fine-middle grained (fmg subfacies) up to \n\ncoarse-middle grained (cmg subfacies) and a massive structure.  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2: Geological map of the studied area and location of the studied samples. \n\nThe cmg subfacies is the dominant variety of alkali feldspar granites and quartz \n\nsyenites (Fig. 4.4.a). The rock is composed by subhedral microcline, euhedral to subhedral \n\nelongated crystals of Na-amphibole and interstitial anhedral quartz. In this subfacies, the \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nmicrocline tends to be more euhedric and the amphibole crystals are larger compared with \n\nmicrocline and amphiboles of the other subfacies.  \n\nThe fmg subfacies occurs in a very restricted region, in the central part of the ridge \n\n(Fig 4.2).  It is mainly composed of a grey-pinkish equigranular matrix of subhedral to \n\neuhedral alkaline feldspar, subhedral sodic amphiboles and interstitial anhedric quartz (Fig \n\n4.4.b).  \n\n In the eastern portion of the hill outcrops the medium equigranular subfacies (mg) \n\nwith a greenish-grey matrix composed of subhedral to anhedaal microcline, subhedral \n\nripiform sodic amphiboles and anhedral quartz (Fig 4.4.c).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3: a \u2013 The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is surrounded by the Guapor\u00e9 River floodplain; b \u2013 \n\nOutcrop in the Serra Grande Hill. The vegetation is scarce, giving a good rock exposure. \n\nIn the eastern portion of the area, the syenite is intruded by a a decameter-wide \n\ntrachytic dyke. The trachyte represents volcanic facies of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. It \n\nhas an aphanitic matrix and phenocrystals of alkaline feldspar and sodic amphiboles (Fig. \n\n4.4.d). Enclaves are found in the northwest area associated with the cmg subfacies. Part of \n\nthese enclaves is round shaped xenoliths with an aphanitic gray matrix and ripiform \n\nphenocrystals of feldspar (Fig. 4.4.e). Also, pegmatoid pods are sparsely found associated \n\nwith cmg subfacies, where centimeter-sized euhedral amphibole and centimeter-sized \n\nanhedral quartz are found.  \n\nAnother feature is the clusters of Na-amphibole indicating local magmatic flow (Fig. \n\n4.4. f). Also, a very important feature of these granites is the presence of interstitial fine \n\ngrained elpidite (Fig 4.4.a, b, c). The elpidite is the mineral that gives to the Ouro Fino \n\nIntrusive Suite a pink coloured aspect and reaches up to 5% of the modal mineralogy. Small \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nscale elongated quartz veins crosscut the granite stock and are parallel to the main NW-\n\ntrend. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4: a \u2013 coarse-midle grained subfcacies exhibiting a phaneritic equigranular texture; b \u2013 fine-middle \ngrained subfaces with pervasive presence of elpidite in the rock matrix; c \u2013 middle grained subfacies of the \nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite; d \u2013 trachyte dyke with scattered phenocrystals of Na-amphibole and K-feldspar and \naphanitic grey matrix ; e \u2013 Enclave with mafic aphanitic matrix and ripiform K-feldspar phenocrystals; f \u2013 Local \nmagmatic flow of Na-amphiboles. \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nIn microscopic scale, differences in grain size are less evident on the microscopic \n\nscale. The variable grain size of microcline causes granulometric differences between the \n\nsubfacies. The rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite are holocrystalline, leucocratic, \n\nmedium grained and equigranular to seriate texture (Fig 4.5.a, b). The main minerals \n\nobserved in thin section are micropertitic microcline, arfvedsonite rimmed by aegirine, quartz \n\nand elpidite (Fig. 4.5.c, d). Titanite, zircon, analcime, garnet and aenigmatite occur \n\nsubordinately in sub- to anhedral, fine-grained habits. (Fig. 4.5. e, f). \n\n The microcline exhibits euhedral to subhedral crystals with compositional zoning \n\nand micropertitic exsolution. The crystals usually are squared and are often seen as \n\ninclusions inside of the Na-amphiboles. Also, some crystals present very fine-grained \n\ninclusions that resemble zircon and apatite. In some samples, the microcline presents subtle \n\nalbitization, with fine grained anhedral albite. The main Na-amphibole is arfvedsonite, \n\noccurring as subhedral to euhedral ripiform crystals. Its edges are frequently rimmed by \n\naegirine and the replacement in some crystals is quite intense, being the aegirine \n\noverplacing the arfvedsonite.  \n\nQuartz is medium- to fine-grained and occupies interstices between the other \n\nminerals. The form of the crystals is defined by the shape of the surroundings crystals and \n\nthe contacts are usually curvy to straight. Some inclusions of euhedral microcline crystals \n\nare scattered in the quartz crystals. Undulatory extinction is a common feature in these \n\ncrystals. The elpidite occurs in clusters of fine to very fine-grained crystals associated with \n\nfine-grained anhedral quartz and with anhedral zircon. The zircon is always anhedral, yellow \n\ncoloured and fine grained. It is always occupying voids and interstices between the the major \n\nminerals. Along with zircon, the titanite fills the interstices of the rock. Analcime, garnet and \n\naenigmatite are rare and if present, they are anhedral and fine-grained. The table 1 \n\n(Appendix 1) summarizes the modal mineralogy from the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite that had \n\nbeen identified in the petrographic studies.  \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5: Transmitted light micrographs of thin sections with parallel (left) and crossed nicols (right). a and b \n\u2013 General texture of the cmg subfaces. Note the arfvedsonite crystals rimmed by aegirine; c and d \u2013 \ncryptocrystalline elpidite crystals associated to quartz inside primary elpidite pseudomorphs; zircon crystals \noccupying interstices between the major minerals; e and f \u2013 crystals of zircon filling voids between the major \nminerals. Mineral abbreviation: Aeg \u2013 Aegirine; Anl \u2013 Analcime; Arf \u2013 Arfvedsonite; Kfs \u2013 Potassic Feldspar; \nElp \u2013 Elpidite; Qz \u2013 Quartz; Zrn \u2013 Zircon. \n\nThe modal mineralogy from the cmg and fmg subfacies was also verified through \n\nXRD analyses using the Rietveld method to interpret the mineralogical composition. The \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nmineralogical results from the XRD of rock powder analyses are displayed in Table 2 \n\n(Appendix 1). The two analysed samples represent the two most common phases of the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite Suite, the fmg and cmg phases. The results display relative equal \n\ncontents of sodic and potassic feldspars, evidencing thus the hypersolvus character of the \n\nmassif. The quartz exhibits higher content than expected from the optical estimation of the \n\nthin sections. The results for mafic minerals suggests that in the cmg granites. there is less \n\naegirine than in the fmg lithotype. Elpidite, which composes between 5 and 10 % of modal \n\nmineralogy was not identified in the DRX assays. \n\n4.5.2. S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite \n\nThe southern-central part of the massif presents a pink grayish granitoid, with a \n\nporphyritic texture defined by pink K-feldspar crystals in a fine grained equigranular matrix \n\ncomposed of amphibole, K-feldspar and quartz. This porphyritic granite is part of the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos Intrusive Suite. The phenocrystals are euhedral to subhedral and dominate the \n\nmatrix (80% of K-feldspar). The amphiboles are needle-shaped and the quartz, \n\nsubordinately occupy the interstices between the other crystals. Like the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite, the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite presents enclaves that have a brecciated \n\nappearance, with angular forms and vary from a very hololeucocratic matrix defined by \n\nalkaline feldspar to a melanocratic aphanitic mafic composition matrix composed of fine-\n\ngrained mafic minerals.  \n\nMicroscopically, these granitoids display a seriate texture. The microcline presents \n\nintense micropertitic intergrowth. Plagioclase is fine to middle grained, tabular shaped and \n\nsubhedral form and can substitute microcline in the rims. Quartz is anhedral to subhedral \n\nand is interstitial between other minerals. As mafic minerals, there is subhedral medium-\n\ngrained biotite. Opaque minerals occur scattered throughout the rock. Whereas in the Ouro \n\nFino Intrusive Suite the euhedral zircon is absent, the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite shows \n\nzircon crystals with euhedral form. \n\n4.5.3. Costa Marques Intrusive Suite \n\nThe eastern part of the Serra Grande hill is intersected by a diabase/dacite dyke, of \n\nN10E trend. The rock has a porphyritic texture defined by milimetric euhedral crystals of K-\n\nfeldspar and a gray aphanitic matrix. Veinlets of anhedrical fine grained K-feldspar cut the \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nrock. Millimeter-sized amygdalae occur frequently in the rocks. Southwards from the Serra \n\nGrande, there are volcanic breccias associated with trachytes. \n\n4.6. Geochemistry \n\nThe geochemical results are from 18 rock samples and permitted not only to classify \n\nthe rocks but also to discriminate the volcanic rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite from \n\nthe Costa Marques Intrusive Suite and S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite, which occurrence in \n\nthe Serra Grande Hill was up to date unknown. Among the 18 analysed rocks, 13 are from the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite, 2 from the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite and 3 from the Costa \n\nMarques Intrusive Suite. All the three subfacies of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite were \n\nanalyzed along with a trachyte dyke. The basalt that is part of to the Costa Marques Intrusive \n\nSuite is not included in the charts of Fig 4.9 once these diagrams are not suitable for this \n\nkind of rock. Some samples of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite yielded Zr content more than \n\nthe upper detection limit (10,000 ppm) and thus, these Zr contents are considerate as 10,000 \n\nppm in order to permit the plots. The geochemical results for the three suites are exposed \n\nin Table 3 (Appendix 1). \n\nIn accord with Frost et al. (2001), the figure 4.6.a shows the FeOtot/(FeOtot+MgO) \n\nplots for the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques \n\nIntrusive Suite. In this chart, all the three suites display a strict ferroan character. However, \n\nin the MALIxSiO2 plot (Frost et al. 2001), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite presents a variation \n\nbetween alkaline and calc-alkaline (Fig. 4.6.b). The calc-alkaline types are the trachyte dyke, \n\nfmg, mg and cmg subfacies, whereas the cmg and mg subfacies show higher variability. \n\nThe S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite plot only in the \n\nalkaline field.   \n\nConsonant with Maniar and Piccoli (1989), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite features a \n\nperalkaline pattern in the chart A/NK x A/CNK chart (Fig. 4.6.c). Moreover, the S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos Intrusive Suite exhibits a peralkaline composition whereas the Costa Marques \n\nIntrusive Suite is metaluminous. In the three charts (Fig. 4.6 d, e, f) for discrimination \n\nbetween A-type and I- or S-type granites, the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite presents a distinct \n\nA-type granite character (Whalen et al., 1987). The S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa \n\nMarques Intrusive Suite are also included in the A-type field, but litte less prounounced. The \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nZr, Ce and Y contents of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite are 10-times higher compared to the \n\nCosta Marques Intrusive Suite.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6:  Binary diagrams of the chemical results from the silica saturated rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite (OFIS), S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite (SDIS) and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite (CMIS) in accord to \n\nFrost et al. (2011) \u2013 a and b; Maniar and Piccoli (1989) - c; Whalen et al. (1987) \u2013 d, e and f. \n\nThe REE contents normalized to the chondrite of Boynton (1984) show clear \n\ndiscrepancies between the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, \n\nthough not so evident discrepancies between the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite and Ouro \n\nFino Intrusive Suite (Fig. 4.7). In the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, the REE-patterns \n\ndisplay a discrete Eu anomaly and also a flat line in the basalt sample. In the Costa Marques \n\nIntrusive Suite, the LREE are slightly enriched compared to HREE, yielding an average \n\n(La/Yb)n = 5.15. \n\nThe Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite reveals different enrichments for LREE in relation to \n\nHREE (Fig. 4.7). The average (La/Yb)n rate for the cmg subfaces is 7.36 and for the fine-\n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nmiddle grained 10.42. The only sample of the middle grained subfaces shows (La/Yb)n = \n\n6.92. The S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite evidence (La/Yb)n rates of 12.49 \u2013 similar to the \n\nfmg of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7: REE content of the analysed rocks from the Costa Marques (CMIS), S\u00e3o Domingos (SDIS) and \n\nOuro Fino (OFIS) intrusive suites normalized to the chondrite of Boyton (1984). \n\nEuropium anomalies are distinct in both Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos Intrusive Suite. In accord with the figure 4.7, some samples of the Ouro Fino \n\nIntrusive Suite displayed Ce anomalies, either with some Ce depletion or enrichment.  \n\nThe Fig. 4.8 presents the multielement chart with the chemical results from the three \n\nsuites after normalization to the chondrite of Thompson (1982). The Costa Marques Intrusive \n\nSuite presents K enrichment whereas the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nIntrusive Suite are depleted in this element. Strontium, P and Ti form negative anomalies in \n\nthe Ouro Fino and S\u00e3o Domingos intrusive suites, however, in the Costa Marques Intrusive \n\nSuite, these elements are slightly depleted. The lower contents of Ba and higher contents \n\nof Zr, Hf, Y and REE permit a clear distinction between the of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nand the other two suites, resulting thus in the geochemical discrimination of the rocks that \n\noutcrop in the Serra Grande Hill. The higher contents of Zr, Hf, Y and REE can be related \n\nto the zircon and elpidite (zirconosilicates) that are absent in the Costa Marques Intrusive \n\nSuite and less frequent in the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite, in which only primary zircon \n\nhas been identified.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8: Chemical results chart from the analysed samples from the Costa Marques (CMIS), S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos (SDIS) and Ouro Fino (OFIS) intrusive suites normalized to the chondrite of Thompson (1982). \n\nIn accord with Eby (1992), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive \n\nSuite fit into the A2-type granite (Fig. 4.9.a, b). Although, one sample presented an A1-type pattern, what \n\ncould be considered as possible hydrothermal alteration.   \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 Classification of alkaline granites in accord with Eby (1992) for the rocks of the S\u00e3o Domingos \n\nand Ouro Fino intrusive suites. a \u2013 ternary diagram Y-Nb-Ce; b \u2013 ternary diagram for Y-Nb-3*Ga.  \n\n4.7. Mineral Chemistry  \n\nElectron probe microanalyses (EPMA) were performed on 6 samples from the Ouro \n\nFino Intrusive Suite. Among, these 6 samples, the samples CM-20B, CM28C, CM31 and \n\nCM39 were analysed at BGR in Hanover, Germany. The samples CM18 and CM20A were \n\nanalysed in the EPMA laboratory from the Universidade de Bras\u00edlia. All the samples are \n\nalkali feldspar granites with sodic amphiboles, 5 from the cmg subfacies and one from the \n\nfmg subfaces (CM31). The targeted minerals were amphiboles, aegirines rimming the \n\namphiboles, titanite and the zirconosilicates (elpidite and zircon). The classification of \n\namphiboles was made in accord with the spreadsheet of Locock (2014), the pyroxenes were \n\ndefined with the aid of the software PX-NOM (Sturm, 2002).  \n\nThe main amphibole identified in the EPMA analysis is arfvedsonite (Table 4). In \n\naccord with the classification of Locock (2014), the mineral chemistry leaded to the \n\nidentification of ferro-eckermannite and fluor-arfvedsonite. However, the chemical \n\ncomposition of the analysed amphiboles did not differ significantly, therefore the single term \n\narfvedsonite is more appropriate for this work. The analysed pyroxenes were always at the \n\nrims of the Na-amphiboles. In accord with the PX-NOM software, all the pyroxenes are \n\nstrictly aegirine. Compared to the aegirine, arfvedsonite presents a higher CaO budget. \n\nMoreover, the arfvedsonite exhibits F contents yielding between 1.44% and 2% of F. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nTitanite, zircon and elpidite were defined in accord with the stoichiometric balance \n\nfor the calculated oxides of the analysed elements. Moreover, for the zirconosilicates, a \n\nclassification scheme created by Salvi and Williams-Jones (1995) was used given the \n\nrelationship between these minerals with mineralization (Fig. 4.12). The mineral chemistry \n\nresults and classification of the analysed amphiboles and pyroxenes are shown in table 2. \n\nThe mineral chemistry results for analysed zircon and titanite are in table 5 and for elpidite \n\nin table 6. \n\nIn accord with the EPMA results (Fig 10.a, b), the zircon yields TREO+Y (total rare \n\nearth oxides + yittrium oxide) values from 3.2% up to 7.3% (Table 5). The titanite also \n\ncontains REE+Y in its structure, but the TREO+Y content ranges in a lower interval between \n\n1.07 and 3.53% (Table 5). Analyses of elpidite (Fig 10.c, d) show Y2O3 contents ranging \n\nfrom 0.21 up to 1.92 wt.%, but low LREE (La, Ca) contents (Tab 4). An enrichment of CaO \n\nwas observed in the elpidite, hence defining the elpidites of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as \n\nCa-elpidite given the trend towards gittinsite and armostrongite (Fig 4.12). The CaO contents \n\nvary from 0.30 in elpidites from the cmg subfacies (CM-39) up to 3.01% in the fmg subfacies \n\n(CM-31), with an average of 1.75%. K2O contents are also high in some elpidite crystals, \n\nranging between 4.18% and 6.94% whereas when in low content, ranges between 0.26 and \n\n0.65%.  \n\nThe zircon and the elpidite can be considered important hosts for Zr and Hf. The Zr \n\nand Hf in the zircon vary from 56.17% up to 59.87% and 0.93% up to 1.49%, respectively \n\n(Table. 5). Elpidite carries less Zr and Hf amounts with values ranging from 18.9% up to \n\n21.82 % for Zr and for Hf the variability lies between 0.34% up to 0.57% (Table 6). \n\nNonetheless, elpidite content in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite reaches up to 5% in a modal \n\nestimative. becoming the major REE-Zr host in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. The titanite \n\npresents some enrichment of Y, La and Ce reaching around 3% in total (Table 5.). \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10: a \u2013 zircon occupying void beside arfvedsonite crystal. BSE image; b \u2013 Same detail from the \nprevious image, now in under the plane polarized light; c \u2013 elpidite crystals cluster and the spots where the \ncrystals were analysed by EPMA. BSE image; d \u2013 The same elpidite cluster seen under the plane polarized \nlight. \n\nSince zircon is the mineral that contains the highest content of REE+Y in the Ouro \n\nFino Intrusive Suite, WDS analyses targeted a zircon from the sample CM18. The Fig. 4.11.a \n\nshows the analysed minerals, and Table 7 exhibits the respective chemical WDS analyses \n\nfrom the spots 31/1, 31/2 and 31/3. The spot 31/2 target the centre of the crystal and spots \n\n31/1 and 31/2 analysed the surrounding area. The zircon yielded TREO+Y of 5,15%, \n\nhowever, the surrounding area of the analysed crystal presented 16.83% and 23.83% of \n\nTREO+Y for the spots 31/1 and 31/3 respectively (Table 7). Though, the targeted area of \n\nspots 31/3 did not fill the stoichiometric composition of zircon, being not possible to \n\ndetermine which mineral the crystal needles might represent. The spot 31/1 represents the \n\nchemical composition of the mass rimming these acicular minerals and the zircon (Fig \n\n4.11.b). The rimming mass is composed mainly of SiO (27.4%). FeO (14.6%). CaO (10.9%) \n\nand ZrO (7.2%), being also not possible to determine which mineral it could represent. In \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nthe needle around the zircon boundary, REE occur mainly as La2O3 (5.9%), Ce2O3(8.1%), \n\nNd2O3(1.1%). The other REE occur variable and less significative amounts. For the mass \n\nrimming the zircon and the acicular crystals, Ce is the dominant REE. In both spots 31/1 \n\nand 31/3, F was not detected. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11: a \u2013 Detail of zircon assayed with WDS and EDS analyses; b \u2013 The SEM image is the detailed \n\nregion inside the blue square. Note the mass and needles grown on the zircon crystal boundary. \n\n4.8. The Origin of the REE-Zr Mineralization  \n\nThe new mapping for the region of Serra Grande Hill (Fig. 4.2) shows two other \n\nigneous units outcropping in the area. Despite the fact that the Costa Marques and S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos intrusive suites are also alkaline (Payolla et al., 2013, this work), the petrographic \n\nfeatures associated with geochemical data and previous surveys (Costa, 1990; Buch et al., \n\n2018) demonstrate that the REE-Zr mineralization is constricted to the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite.  \n\nAccording to with Eby (1992), the Fig. 4.9 shows that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nand the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite originated from the melting of continental crust. \n\nBettencourt et al. (2014)  state that isotopes of Hf confirm the old crustal source for the \n\nmagmas of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite whereas the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite is of \n\njuvenile and crustal origins. The REE chart indicates that the fractionation of LREE in the \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite is greater than in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, even though \n\nthe fmg subfacies show similar values (Fig. 4.8).  \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nThe absence of primary magmatic zircon and the outstanding elpidite content of the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite compared to the S\u00e3o Domingos Intrusive Suite endorse the \n\nassertion that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is the host of the REE-Zr mineralization. \n\n4.9. Comparison with Similar REE-Zr Deposits \n\nThe chemical, petrographic and mineralogical results of this study point out the \n\nexistence of a REE-Zr mineralization in the Ouro Fino Intrusive. Rare metal mineralizations \n\nare related to alkaline granites such as Strange Lake, Kahn Bogd and Kaldzan-Buregtey  \n\n(Salvi and Williams-Jones. 1990; Gysi and Williams-Jones. 2013; Kovalenko et al.. 1995; \n\nKynicky et al.. 2011). In these deposits, the main ore minerals are sodic-calcic \n\nzirconosilicates like elpidite, armstrongite, gittingsite, catapleiite, zircon and eudialyte.  \n\nIn the Strange Lake deposit, the mineralization is related to elpidite crystallized \n\nunder magmatic conditions, whereas the Ca-zirconosilicates (armstrongite and gittinsite) are \n\nthe result of late stage metasomatic processes, thus replacing primary elpidite ( Salvi and \n\nWilliams-Jones. 1995). In Khan-Bogd and Strange Lake, there is a lack of primary zircon and \n\nmagmatic elpidite is abundant (Kynicky et al., 2011; Salvi and Williams-Jones, 1995). As \n\nwell, the replacement of elpidite for Ca-elpidite and armstrongite happens in Khan-Bogd. \n\nThe results of our study indicate that these characteristics appear likewise in the Ouro Fino \n\nIntrusive Suite.  \n\nIn the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, the Ca-Zr silicates are absently reflecting the low \n\ncontent of Ca2+ in the fluid. Though the fig. 4.12 shows that elpidite and zircon present a \n\ntrend towards gittinsite and armostrongite. being the elpidite from the cmg subfaces the most \n\ncalcic. The blurry aspect of the elpidite in thin-section and SEM images support the \n\nhypothesis of secondary origin. The enrichment of K2O in elpidite is still not well understood, \n\nhowever, the elpidites of Khan Bogd present K2O enrichments as well (Grigor\u2019eva et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nThe lack of gittinsite in the rock could be related to the absence or insufficiency of \n\nCa2+ in the fluid. Additionally, titanite could be a Ca2+ consumer during the metasomatic \n\nprocesses. The Ca could be originated from the amphiboles structures since the amphiboles \n\npresented up to 6% of CaO in the mineral chemistry results (Table 4).  \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12: Ternary diagram for Na, Zr and Ca in cation proportion for the zirconosilicates of the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite. The grey triangles indicate zirconosilicates from the cmg subfaces and the blue \n\nsquares from the fmg subfaces. The red squares represent the respective end-members compositions. \n\nDiagram adapted from Salvi and Williams-Jones (1995) and Gysi et al. (2016). \n\n4.10. A Mineralization Model for the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nIn this work, no other other minerals that might contain REE in the Ouro Fino \n\nIntrusive Suite have been identified. The occurrence of xenotime and bastnaesite, which are \n\ncommon in other deposits (Gysi and Williams-Jones, 2013; Michael et al, 2017; \n\nChakhmouradian and Zaitsev, 2012), are reported in previous works (Freitas, 1985; Costa, \n\n1990; Costa, 1988) whereas in this work, the presence of these minerals is still not \n\nconfirmed. Moreover, this study does not comprise F analyses in the bulk-rock chemistry, \n\nbut the mineral chemistry analyses for arfvedsonite and aegirine evidence a depletion of F \n\nfrom the arfvedsonite during transformation to aegirine (table 2), suggesting F as an active \n\nagent during the ore formation processes. In addition, the zircon crystals and the mass \n\naround them yielded none F content, what could imply a release of F from Na-amphiboles \n\nbefore the mineralization. Another possibility is the fractionation of F in the lattice of Ca-\n\nelpidite, resulting in the capture of F from the fluid before the crystallisation of zircon. These \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nhypotheses suggest the hydrothermal-deuteric mineralization happened without or little \n\namount F in the system and explains the lack of REE fluoride minerals in the Ouro Fino \n\nIntrusive Suite.  \n\nIn fact, the absence of F in the mineralization fluid is not impeditive to transport REE \n\nbut to precipitate them (Migdisov et al., 2016). These authors define S and Cl as main \n\nligands for transport of the REE at hydrothermal conditions, whereas the presence of F \n\nreduces the stabilities of REE in hydrothermal fluids. Indeed, the elpidite concentrations up \n\nto 5% in the rock matrix place this mineral as the main ore mineral for the Ouro Fino Intrusive \n\nSuite mineralization.  \n\nThe significant amount of Ca-elpidite, or pseudomorphs of elpidite, suggests H2O \n\ndominated crystallization conditions and classify the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as agpaitic \n\ndespite the fact that the hydrothermalism resulted also in zircon, which is considered a \n\nmineral of miaskitic rocks (Marks and Markl, 2017). The deposition of REE, in this case, \n\ncould be associated with the inclusion into the structure of the zirconosilicates, which are \n\nREE-free minerals. Migdisov et al. (2016) consider that the incorporation of REE into the \n\nlattice of non-REE minerals is one of the effective fractionation mechanism for REE.  \n\nThe needles and the mass rimming zircon crystals exhibit SiO2, FeO, CaO and ZrO \n\ncontentss associated with high concentrations of La2O3, Ce2O3 and Nd2O3. The mass and \n\nthe needles might have precipitated onto the edges of zircon during the decrease of \n\nhydrothermalism temperature. Moreover, the absence of F in these rims corroborate the \n\nhypotheses of F depletion or incorporation in the lattice of elpidite. If the late fluid contained \n\nsome F, it should be expected that some REE-fluoride could be identified.  \n\nThereby, the sequence of the mineral crystallization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite \n\nis proposed in the fig. 4.13. Given the inclusions of K-feldpar in the amphiboles, it is assumed \n\nthat microcline was formed in the early magmatic stages. The arfvedsonite formed in the \n\nsequence followed by the aegirine on its rims. The existence of ferro-eckermannite in the \n\nOuro Fino Intrusive Suite is still not well understood. If an albitization took place in the late \n\nstages of magmatism, the ferro-eckermannite could be the result of incorporation of Al2O3 \n\nby the Na-amphiboles. But this hypothesis is still constricted by the need for further studies. \n\nThe existence of anhedric and fine grained elpidite in clusters that resemble \n\npseudomorpohs of elpidite sustain the possibility of primary elpidite instead of zircon. Thus, \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nzircon and Ca-elpidite formed in the hydrothermal stages. The existence of titanite in the \n\nrock beside zircons in the interstitial spaces could only explain a hydrothermal origin.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13: Mineral paragenesis evolution sequence of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. \n\n4.11. Conclusion \n\nThis study identifies the existence of three different alkaline intrusive suites in the \n\nSerra Grande Hill. Even though the S\u00e3o Domingos (1057 \u00b1 10 Ma) and the Costa Marques \n\nintrusive (998 \u00b1 10 Ma) suites intrude the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (1347 \u00b1 9Ma), the \n\npetrographic and geochemical data advocate that the REE-Zr mineralization is factually \n\nassociated to the most anciet of them. \n\nThe Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is a hypesolvus alkaline granite, being microcline the \n\nfirst mineral to crystallize, and followed by the arfvedsonite. The substitution of arfvedsonite \n\nto aegirine in the amphibole rimes and also eventual rims of plagioclase on microcline rims \n\nare evidence of a Na enrichment during the crystallization.  \n\nThe REE-Zr mineralization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suites is associated mainly \n\nwith elpidite and zircon and subordinately with titanite. The crystallisation of the \n\nzirconosilicates seems to happen in the late-crystallization processes, with elpidite, titanite \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nand specially zircon occupying interstices of the rock. The formation of elpidite and zircon \n\nmight be associated with pre-existing high contents of Zr, REE and Na in the magma, \n\nwhereas titanite can be the metasomatic product of aenigmatite and Ca depletion from \n\namphiboles. \n\nThe present study did not identify fluorides, carbonates and sulphides associated \n\nwith the mineralization. The REE fractionation from the magma is possibly a product of \n\nincorporation of REE in the lattice of elpidite, titanite and specially zircon. The existence of \n\nan amorphous mass rich on Ce and La around of zircon crystals propones that REE also \n\nconcentrated by the cooling of the hydrothermal system. There is a clear enrichment of \n\nLREE compared to HREE, being the average Lan/Ybn ? 8. \n\nThe existence of pseudomorphos of primary elpidite defines the Ouro Fino \n\nmagmatism as agpaitic, allied to its clear peralkaline character. Similar examples of REE-Zr \n\nmineralization are Strange Lake, in Canad\u00e1 and, Khan Bogd and Khaldzan Buregtey, both \n\nin Mongolia. \n\n4.12. .Acknowledgements \n\n\u201cThis work would not be possible without the encouragement of Prof. Bernhard \n\nManfred B\u00fchn.
