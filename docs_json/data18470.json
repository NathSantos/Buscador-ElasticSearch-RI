Soil physical attributes depend\non relief forms, and their assessment is important in mechanized agricultural\nsystems, such as of sugarcane.  This study aimed to characterize the spatial\nvariability in the physical soil attributes and their relationship to the hillslope\ncurvatures in an Alfisol developed from sandstone and growing sugarcane.  Grids\nof 100 x 100 m were delimited in a convex and a concave area.  The grids had a\nregular spacing of 10 x 10 m, and the crossing points of this spacing determined a\ntotal of 121 georeferenced sampling points.  Samples were collected to determine\nthe physical attributes related to soil aggregates, porosity, bulk density, resistance\nto penetration and moisture within the 0\u20130.2 and 0.2\u20130.4 m depth.  Statistical\nanalyses, geostatistics and Student\u2019s t-tests were performed with the means of the\nareas.  All attributes, except aggregates > 2 mm in the 0\u20130.2 m depth and\nmacroporosity at both depths, showed significant differences between the hillslope\ncurvatures.  The convex area showed the highest values of the mean weighted\ndiameter, mean geometric diameter, aggregates > 2 mm, 1\u20132 mm aggregates, total\nporosity and moisture and lower values of bulk density and resistance to\npenetration in both depth compared to the concave area.  The number of soil\nattributes with greater spatial variability was higher in the concave area.\n\nIndex terms: soil-landscape relationship, geostatistics, semivariogram.\n\n(1) Part of the first author\u2019s dissertation.

Landscape attributes such as\ncurvatures and slopes, among others, influence the\nhydrological conditions, resulting in different\nmoisture and water flow patterns.  In studies by Seibert\net al. (2007), the influence of topography on the\nformation of different soil types mediated by\nhydrological processes was characterized, and this\ninfluence can possibly be understood and predicted\nthrough the use of soil physical attributes (Mello et\nal., 2007).\n\nThe adoption of highly mechanized cultivation and\nharvesting techniques in sugarcane plantations has\nprovoked alterations in the behavior of soil physical\nattributes and in the sugarcane yields (Souza et al.,\n2004a,b).  The main effect of mechanization is soil\ncompaction, and further studies to evaluate this\nprocess are necessary to optimize crop production.  The\nevaluation of soil physical attributes is important to\ndiagnose the degree of compaction and guide the\nphysical soil management.\n\nIn studies to diagnose the soil physical state of a\nlandscape, some authors have found that the spatial\nvariability in soil physical attributes is related to the\nlandscape forms (Souza et al., 2004a; Brito et al., 2006;\nCamargo et al., 2008).  The potential of soil\ndegradation by a management varies according to the\nlocation of the landscape and the spatial distribution\nof landscape attributes (Cambardella et al., 2004;\nPennock, 2003).  Soares et al. (2005) affirmed that, to\nunderstand the temporal variation in the soil physical\nattributes, it is necessary to consider vertical and\nlateral variations (along the toposequence).  Juh\u00e1sz\net al. (2006) concluded that the physical-hydric\nbehavior of the studied soil is influenced by landscape\nconditions.\n\nCampos et al. (2006) emphasized the importance\nof landscape models to understand the soil-\ngeomorphology relationships.  The same authors\nreported on the model established by Troeh (1965),\nwhich is based on relief profiles and hillslope\ncurvatures in which the pedoforms vary from linear\nover convex to concave.  Nizeyimana &amp; Bicki (1992),\nPennock et al. (2001), De Alba et al. (2004), Montanari\net al. (2005), Van Oost et al. (2005), and Brito et al.\n(2006) studied the relationships between the spatial\nvariability in soil attributes and terrain curvature.\n\nThe dependence and spatial variability of soil\nattributes can be characterized by geostatistical\nanalyses.  These analyses involve mainly the\nsemivariogram, which is the estimation and modeling\n\n\n\nSPATIAL VARIABILITY OF PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF AN ALFISOL UNDER DIFFERENT...          619\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nof the spatial variance structure, and kriging, which\nis the prediction of regionalized variable values of\nunsampled points or regions (Vieira, 2000).\n\nThe spatial variability of aggregate stability and\norganic matter in an Oxisol was explained by Souza\net al. (2004a) by small variations in the slope gradient\nand in relief forms.  The spatial dependence of stable\naggregates was observed in an Oxisol studied by\nCamargo et al. (2008) and was spatially correlated to\nthe clay fraction mineralogy.  Zanette et al. (2007)\nevaluated the spatial moisture variability of a\nHapludox and found values for this attribute ranging\nfrom 5.20 to 10.67 m.  The authors reported that no\nspatial dependence was observed in the studied\nattribute in deeper depths.\n\nGeoestatistical analyses also make the\ndetermination possible of intensity and form of\nattribute sampling because the semivariogram range\nvalues indicate the ideal sampling distance (Vieira et\nal., 1992).  In this case, attributes with larger range\nvalues require a smaller sample quantity than\nattributes with lower range values.  However, in the\nabsence of spatial dependence, classical statistics are\napplied (Silva et al., 1989).\n\nThe objective of this study was to characterize the\nspatial variability of physical attributes of a\nsugarcane-cultivated Alfisol developed from sandstone\nand the relationship between these attributes and\nhillslope curvatures.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe study area is located in Catanduva, state of\nS\u00e3o Paulo (latitude 21o05\u201957.11\"S and longitude\n\n49 o 01 \u2019 02.08 \u201d W).  The regional climate, according\nto K\u00f6ppen\u2019s classification, is tropical hot humid, type\nAw, with dry winters.  The average precipitation is\n1,350 mm, and the average annual temperature\n23 oC.  The temperature in the hottest month is >\n22 oC and in the coldest month &lt;18 oC.  The principal\nvegetation types in the Catanduva region are seasonal\nrainforest and cerrado (savanna-like), and the current\npredominant land use in the region for over 20 years\nwas sugarcane cultivation, in a harvest system that\nincludes burning.\n\nThe soils, classified as a Typic Hapludalf (Soil\nSurvey Staff, 1999) with medium texture, are derived\nfrom weathering sedimentary sandy rocks from the\nBauru Group, Adamantina Formation (IPT, 1981).\nThe studied area was characterized with aerial\npictures of the elevation profile of the region at a scale\nof 1:35,000, and the fields were classified by\ngeomorphological and pedological classifications.\n\nTo identify the relief forms according to Troeh\n(1965), a 200 ha area was mapped using the Global\nPositioning System (GPS) equipment.  Coordinates\nand altimetry were used to construct a digital elevation\nmodel (DEM) using the Surfer program (1999)\n(Figure 1).  The field and DEM observations allowed\nthe identification of two areas of interest, one a convex\nand the other a concave hillslope area.  In the DEM\narea (Figure 1), arrows indicate the intensity and\nsurface water flow, illustrating the slope modeling\nand, consequently, the water flow distribution pattern.\nIn the concave area, the water flow is heterogeneous\nand has a disorganized distribution pattern, whereas\nin the convex area, this distribution pattern is\nhomogeneous and organized.  The granulometric and\nchemical characterizations of the hillslope curvatures\nare presented in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area. Arrows indicate land modeling and water flow.\n\n\n\n620 Livia Arantes Camargo et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nTwo grids (100 x 100 m) were installed at locations\nrepresenting each of the areas.  The grids had a\nregular spacing of 10 x 10 m, and the intersections of\nthis spacing determined the sampling points,\namounting to a total of 121 georeferenced sampling\npoints.  Trenches (0.3 x 0.3 m, 0.5 m deep) were\nopened for the collection of undisturbed soil samples\nin volumetric rings and disturbed soil samples.  The\nsamples were collected at depths of 0\u20130.2 and 0.2\u2013\n0.4 m.\n\nThe collected samples were crumbled and left to\ndry in the shade.  One part of the soil was sieved in a\n9.51 mm diameter grid sieve for aggregate analysis,\nand the other part was sieved in a 2.0 mm sieve.\nAggregate size and stability were determined using\nthe method described by Kemper &amp; Chepil (1965).  The\naggregates retained in the 4.76 mm sieve were\nsubjected to slow pre-moistening by atomizing with\ndistilled water and afterwards shaken for 15 min in a\nset of sieves with 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.105 mm\nmesh in a water-filled container.  The material\nretained in each sieve was heated to 105 oC in an oven.\nBased on the obtained results, the mean geometric\ndiameter (MGD) and the mean weighted diameter\n(MWD) were calculated.\n\nIn order to determine soil porosity (total porosity,\nmacropores and micropores), the undisturbed samples\nwere saturated for 48 h in a tray with water filling\ntwo-thirds the height of the soil ring.  After the\nsaturation period, the samples were drained at a\npressure of -0.006 MPa using a tension table\n(Embrapa, 1997).  In the same samples, bulk density\nwas determined with the volumetric ring method\naccording to Embrapa (1997), as well as moisture.\nThe soil resistance to penetration was field-determined\nat each grid point using an model IAA/Planalsucar\nimpact penetrometer, and the values were calculated\naccording to Stolf (1991).\n\nThe laboratory analysis results were subjected to\ndescriptive statistical analyses.  For the evaluation of\n\nthe difference between mean values of the attributes\nbetween the areas, the Student\u2019s t-test was applied.\nAll results were obtained using the MINITAB 14\nstatistical package (Minitab, 2000).\n\nFor the spatial dependence analysis geostatistical\ntechniques were used (Vieira et al., 2000).  The\nsemivariograms were estimated under the hypothesis\nof intrinsic stationarity, and a mathematical model\nwas adjusted for those that showed spatial\ndependence.  The semivariogram is a graph that\ncharacterizes the spatial dependence structure of a\nvariable (or of variables) under study.  The\nsemivariogram can be defined as a function that\nconnects the semivariance with the distance vector,\nand can be analytically and/or graphically represented.\nIt is estimated by the following equation:\n\n \n\nwhere N (h) is the number of experimental data pairs\nseparated by vector h, and Z represents the measured\nvalues for soil or crop attributes.  The semivariogram\nis normally represented by the graph of ? (h) versus\nh.  The program GS+ was used for spatial dependence\nevaluation (Gamma Design Software, 1998).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe value distribution of most of the studied\nattributes was symmetric, with skewness and kurtosis\nvalues of approximately zero; the mean and median\nvalues were very close to each other (Tables 2 and 3).\nExceptions were aggregates between 1\u20132 mm (at both\ndepths), MWD, aggregates > 2 mm from the convex\narea and attributes of aggregates in the concave area\nat both depths other than aggregates between 1\u20132 mm\nin the 0\u20130.2 m depth.\n\nTable 1.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nData normality is not a requirement for the\napplication of geostatistical techniques; however, it is\nrecommended that the distribution tails should not\nbe overly long.  The coefficient-of-variation values (CV)\n(Tables 2 and 3) of attributes varied between low\n(&lt;12 %), average (12\u201324 %) and high (> 24 %),\naccording to the classification proposed by Warrick &amp;\nNielsen (1980).  The high values of this estimate reveal\nthe need for an evaluation that allows a better\nunderstanding of the data variation.  The CV estimate\nis a helpful technique in the evaluation of attribute\nvariability used to determine the minimum sampling\nnumber (Cline 1944; Montanari et al., 2005).\nHowever, it does not permit the evaluation of the\nspatial dependence of attributes that are verified,\namong others, by geostatistical techniques.\n\nIt was observed that the mean attributes values that\ndetermine aggregate stability, i.e., the mean weighted\ndiameter (MWD) and mean geometric diameter (MGD),\nwere highest in the 0\u20130.2 m depth (Tables 2 and 3).\n\nThe TPV and macropore values were greater in\nthe surface depth.  In this study the macropore values,\nin both areas and depths, were between 13.29 and\n14.31 % higher than the 10 % considered the\nminimum for plant growth (Drewry &amp; Paton, 2005;\nDrewry et al., 2006; Reynolds et al., 2008).\n\nThe Bd values were close to the values found by\nAra\u00fajo et al. (2004) in a recently cleared and burned\narea.  In Ultisol with 45 % clay, Falleiro et al. (2003)\nfound mean Bd values between 1.14 to 1.37 g cm-3\nand reported that the lowest values observed for to\nconventional tillage were a consequence of soil turning,\naimed mainly at an increase in porosity.\n\nIn the convex area, where the relative Bd values\nwere lowest, the resistance-to-penetration values (RP)\nwere also lowest and moisture highest (in both depths).\nThese results agree with those reported by\nLampurlan\u00e9s &amp; Cantero-Martinez (2003).  Lima et\nal. (2006) stated that, according to the significant\ncorrelation found between moisture, resistance to\npenetration and pre-consolidation pressure, the Ultisol\nload capacity can be estimated by its resistance to\npenetration, confirming the importance of this\nattribute in the evaluation of the physical soil qualities.\nThe mean RP values, in the 0\u20130.2 m depth in both areas,\nwere above the critical value for root growth (3 MPa),\naccording to Lipiec &amp; H\u00e5kansson (2000).\n\nThe mean values of the studied attributes were\ncompared to the values reported in the literature, and\nit was observed that they were not different from\nvalues found in Brazilian Alfisol and Ultisol.\nHowever, a range of maximum and minimum values\n\nTable 2.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nwere observed (Tables 2 and 3) which, for some\nattributes, were not within the interval cited by\nnational and international authors.  This fact,\ntogether with the high attribute variation (CV),\nsuggests the need for a spatial variability analysis.\n\nIt is emphasized that the evaluation of soil\nattributes revealed aspects such as mobility of water\nand air in the soil, which affects root growth and\nmakes soil susceptible to compaction.  The existence\nof a range of values for these attributes indicates that\nthe average values do not represent the spatial activity\nin the area.  This aspect is important for the planning\nof local soil management and indicates that an analysis\nof the spatial variability of attributes is required.\n\nThe Student\u2019s t-test results (Table 4) revealed a\nsignificant difference (5 %) in the attributes means\nbetween the convex and concave areas at the two\nstudied depths, with the exception of the percentage\nof aggregates > 2 mm in the 0\u20130.2 m depth and\nmacropores at both studied depths.\n\nIt was observed that, in the convex area, there\nwere greater values for the MWD, MGD and\npercentages of aggregates > 2 mm and between 1\u2013\n2 mm, TPV and moisture and lowest Bd and RP values\nin both depths.  Therefore, it can be stated that the\nphysical quality of the soils in the convex area was\n\nbetter (Reynolds et al., 2002) than of soils in the\nconcave area, which reflects the clear influence of relief\nforms on the attributes since the applied management\nin the two areas was the same.  Cambardella et al.\n(2004) verified the effect of landscape on soil quality\nby finding positive relationships between the best\nquality indices, also obtained with physical attributes,\nand the higher positions in the landscape.  In the study\nof Soares et al. (2005), the relief influenced the changes\nin density and macropores of an Oxisol under\nsugarcane, confirming the results of Souza (2004).\n\nThese results can be explained by the higher clay,\norganic matter and total iron contents in convex than\nin concave area soils (Table 1).  These attributes are\nfundamental for soil aggregation (Arca &amp; Weed, 1966;\nTisdall &amp; Oades, 1982; Azevedo &amp; Bonum\u00e1, 2004).\nThe difference between them is related to a reduced\nthickness of the A+E horizon of the soils in the convex\narea (0.30 m) than in the concave area (0.39 m)\n(Table 1).  Therefore, in the convex area, there is a\ngreater influence of the more clayey horizon which is\ncharacteristic of Alfisols.  Thus, the influence of relief\non soil thickness and on the fundamental soil\naggregation attributes due to water flow characteristic\nfor each curvature indicates the role of the relief as\nintegration of factors that determine the soil physical\nattributes.\n\nTable 3.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nTo evaluate spatial dependence, semivariograms\n(Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5) were constructed.  The following\nmodels were adjusted to the attribute data: (a)\nexponential for MWD, aggregates > 2 mm,\nmacropores, RP and moisture in the convex area in\nthe 0\u20130.2 m depth, Bd in the convex area in the 0.2\u2013\n0.4 m depth and RP in the concave area at both depths;\n(b) spherical for aggregates > 1 mm, micropores, TPV,\nBd in the convex area in the 0\u20130.2 m depth, MWD,\naggregates > 2 mm, micropores, TPV, RP and\nmoisture of convex area in the 0.2\u20130.4 m depth,\nmicropores, TPV and Bd of the concave area in the\n0.2\u20130.4 m depth.\n\nOf all the attributes for which exponential and\nspherical models were adjusted to semivariograms,\nthe degree of spatial dependence was only high [Co/\n(Co+C1) &lt;25 %] for macropores in the convex area in\nthe 0\u20130.2 m depth and moderate for the other\nattributes [Co/ (Co+C1) between 25 % and 75 %]\naccording to the classification of Cambardella et al.\n(1994).\n\nThe preliminary semivariograms for macropore\nattributes in the 0\u20130.2 m depth, macropores,\nmicropores, TPV and moisture in the 0.2\u20130.4 m depth\nin the concave area showed an increased variance\n\nwithout stabilization.  This demands the removal of\nthe trend or a non-stationarity that can be performed\nby adjusting the data to a surface trend (Davis, 1973).\nIn this study, the use of a linear surface was chosen\nfor the removal of the attribute trends that showed\nthese phenomena according to the methodology\ndescribed by Vieira et al. (1992) and Vieira (2000).\nThe semivariograms resulting from the removal of\nthe trend revealed an absence of spatial dependence\nof these attributes, presenting a pure nugget effect instead\n(Figures 4 and 5).\n\nThe called pure nugget effect (PNE) of data was\nalso observed in the following attributes: MGD,\naggregates between 1\u20132 mm in the 0\u20130.2 m depth,\nMGD, aggregates between 1\u20132 mm, aggregates\n> 1 mm, macropores in the 0.2\u20130.2 m attributes for\nthe convex area and MWD, MGD, aggregates > 2 mm,\naggregates between 1\u20132 mm and aggregates > 1 mm\nin the 0\u20130.2 m depth, MWD, MGD, aggregates\n> 2 mm, aggregates between 1\u20132 mm, aggregates\n&lt;1 mm and Bd in the 0.2\u20130.4 m depth for the concave\narea.  A random spatial distribution was identified\nfor these attributes, and in this case, classical\nstatistical analyses are recommended (Silva et al.,\n1989), and the mean estimate values are\nrepresentative of the area.\n\nTable 4.

Solo, 34:617-630, 2010\n\nfound that for Oxisol, the range of aggregates >2mm\nand aggregates between 1\u20132 mm were greater than\nobserved in this study.  This reflects the greater\nheterogeneity of Alfisols, which typically occupy less\nstable positions in the landscape (Miller &amp; Mehlich,\n1960).\n\nIn this sense, the discontinuity of the physical\nattribute distributions and consequently the spatial\nvariability of these attributes is greater in the concave\narea.  This result matches the heterogenous water\nflow characteristic of this area.\n\nWhen comparing the results of the studied depths,\nit was observed that a greater number of attributes\nwith PNE occurred in the 0.2\u20130.4 m depth in both\nareas.  Higher range values were observed in the\nsurface depth, except for aggregates > 2 mm and\nmicropores in the convex area and RP in the concave\narea.  Grego &amp; Vieira (2005) and Berner et al. (2007)\nalso observed a prevailing spatial dependence of\nphysical attributes in the upper soil depths, and these\nresults were attributed to soil tillage, which in the\nconventional system favors a greater similarity among\npoints that are close than among those that are far\naway from each other.\n\nThese results support decision-making in the\nplanning of soil sampling.  In addition, they send a\nwarning about the variability of physical attributes\nwithin the same soil class and with the same\nmanagement history.  Therefore, the use hillslope\ncurvatures can be useful in outlining similar\nmanagement areas in the field and in determining\nthe sampling scheme, acknowledging the need to\ndetermine the number of samples and spacing between\nthem, which is a constant concern in soil science\n(Webster &amp; Oliver, 1990).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The hillslope curvatures in this study scale\ninfluenced the spatial variability of the soil physical\nattributes.\n\n2. The concave area presented a greater number\nof soil attributes with a greater spatial variability.\n\n3. The convex area is relatively better as the\nphysical quality of soil  for crop development.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Usina S\u00e3o Domingos for granting access\nto the study area.
