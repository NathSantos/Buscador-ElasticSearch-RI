I would like to thank M. Yves Aur\u00e9gan, Re-\nsearch Director CNRS, and M. Jo\u00ebl Gilbert, Director of LAUM, for being welcome during the two\nyears period that I lived in Le Mans as a Ph.D. Student.\n\nWriting this \"Acknowledgments\"essay is not a simple task. To accomplish this doctorate I depended\non so many people, in so particularly different ways, that I can be sure that I will be unfair in my\nfollowing words. But what I am indeed sure of is that I will do my best. What those forgotten or\ninsufficiently acknowledged people can be sure of is that, even though not fairly mentioned here,\nthey are imprinted in my heart.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors Pierrick Lotton, Research\nDirector at LAUM, Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Fran\u00e7a Arruda, Professor at DMC/UNICAMP, and Guillaume\nPenelet, Ma\u00eetre de Conf\u00e9rence at LAUM, for their supervision, support, and guidance along these\nyears either in Brazil or in France - the whole period, from both countries. They have taught me\nhow to pursuit a scientific investigation, how to deal with the risks of failure in this process, and\nhow to publish its results. With and because of them, I could live a discovery experience - which is\nalways priceless no matter how modest it is. That I will carry for life. I am also grateful for their\ninterest, efforts, and full commitment to carry on the non-trivial administrative tasks involved in the\nco-tutelage agreement, besides the arrangements for my moving to and staying in France. And we\nstill had time to have some beers.\n\nI would like to thank Jean-Pierre Dalmont, Professor at LAUM, for his strong support in dealing\nwith the acoustic impedance sensor. I used to just appear at his office and knock at his door - no\nappointments at all - and he was always available for discussion. We had a number of meetings,\nfor months, and his technical advices were crucial to properly operate the sensor and to understand\nimportant aspects concerning impedance measurements.\n\nI would like to give special thanks to David Lee Gardner, Senior Research Fellow at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory/USA, for coming to my defense in Brazil as member of both Brazilian and\nFrench juries (rapporteur). He spent his own money to rush his VISA permit specifically to come\nto my defense. It was a great pleasure welcoming him, and also a privilege. Hopefully I can make\ngood use of his scientific and life experience advices.\n\nix\n\n\n\nI would also like to thank all members of the Thermoacoustic Group of LAUM, Pierrick Lotton,\nGuillaume Penelet, Ga\u00eblle Poignand (Research Engineer), and Matthieu Guedra (Ph.D. Student).\nOur weekly meetings were very productive, as we could regularly share our work and discuss\nsolutions to advance in our research. Those meetings were inestimable opportunities to learn from\neach other.\n\nTechnical support was by all means crucial for my acoustic measurements, which consisted in a\nvery important feature of my thesis work at LAUM. I express my sincere gratitude to all technicians\nwith whom I had contact, because all of them were absolutely precise and efficient - and kind.\nWithout them, I could not have done nothing.\n\nDocuments, bureaucracy and paperwork in general are not simple for all doctorates. However, in\nmy particular case, the co-tutelage context added some issues, and they were not just a few. So I\ndepended on many secretaries, either in Brazil or in France. As the French period of two years was\nin the middle of my doctorate, two changes of university/country had to be dealt with. Lucky me,\nall services were effective. I thank them all, in particular Carlos Della Betta.\n\nStill in the beginning of my doctorate, in Brazil, I had the opportunity to learn from hard disciplines,\nfrom exigent professors. Their exigence, nevertheless, was balanced with their strong enthusiasm\nto teach. So my gratitude is extended to those professors, who taught me that these two features\nfavor one another as part of an effective learning.\n\nI am grateful to all my friends, among them many climbers with whom I had the opportunity to\nshare trust on belay. And when I think about them, I always remember of my rock-climbing group\nGEEU - Grupo de Escalada Esportiva e Montanhismo da Unicamp.\n\nI wish to give special thanks to my close friends Arthur de Miranda Neto, Matthew Alban Boucher,\nFrederico Theotonio, and V\u00e9ronique Bour.\n\nI owe my family much more than I can imagine. I owe my parents much more than my own\nexistence. They gave me everything they could since I was born. Along these doctorate years, my\nfather spared no effort to help me whenever I needed. For two years he was my support from the\nother side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt last, my other half.\nMy wife.\nShe was there all the time for me. She always is.\nI thank my wife for her unconditional support, for her unconditional love.\n\nx\n\n\n\nOs dias que estes homens passam nas montanhas s\u00e3o os dias em que\nrealmente vivem.

Uma tentativa para o \u00eaxito nessa previs\u00e3o vem do conhecimento\nda matriz de transfer\u00eancia do n\u00facleo termoac\u00fastico (NTA), que pode ser explorada em modelos\nanal\u00edticos para o motor considerado. A matriz de transfer\u00eancia por si s\u00f3 pode ser obtida ou por\nmodelagem anal\u00edtica ou medi\u00e7\u00f5es ac\u00fasticas.

Quatro diferentes materiais s\u00e3o testados, cada um\nsendo usado como o elemento poroso colocado no interior do NTA, que \u00e9 por sua vez submetido\na diferentes regimes de gradiente de temperatura. Estes materiais s\u00e3o escolhidos de tal maneira a\ncobrir uma vasta gama de porosidades compreendidas entre esperados stack puro e regenerador\npuro. O m\u00e9todo alternativo foi bem sucedido no seu objectivo para todos os materiais, ao contr\u00e1rio\ndo m\u00e9todo cl\u00e1ssico de duas cargas. Desta forma, as matrizes de transfer\u00eancia medidas s\u00e3o aplicadas\nem uma modelagem dedicada a prever tanto a frequ\u00eancia operacional como o ganho de amplifica-\n\u00e7\u00e3o TA intr\u00ednseca.

Methods for the transfer matrix evaluation of thermoacoustic\ncores with application to the design of thermoacoustic engines. 2014. 149p. Thesis (Doctorate).\nFaculdade de Engenharia Mec\u00e2nica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas.\n\nThe design of a thermoacoustic (TA) engine is improved towards the reliability of its\nperformance prediction. An attempt to succeed in this prediction comes from the knowledge of\nthe TA core (TAC) transfer matrix, which can be exploited in analytical models for the given\nengine. The transfer (T) matrix itself may be obtained either by analytical modeling or acoustic\nmeasurements. The latter consist in an interesting option to avoid thermo-physical or geometrical\nconsiderations of complex structures, as the TAC is treated as a black box. However, before\nproceeding with the experimental approach, an analytical solution is presented for comparison\npurposes, but it contemplates only cases of materials of simple geometry such as a ceramic\ncatalyst. Concerning the experimental approach, three different methods are put forward. A\nclassical two-load method is applied in two different configurations and an alternative method\nbased on impedance measurements is here developed and applied. A comparison between these\napproaches is evaluated by means of a sensitivity analysis, in order to investigate the feasibility\nof each method in further explorations. Four different materials are tested, each one playing the\nporous element allotted inside the TAC, which is in its turn submitted to several different regimes\nof steady state temperature gradient. These materials are chosen in such a way as to cover the wide\nrange of porosities comprised between expected pure stack and pure regenerator. The alternative\nmethod succeeds on its purpose for all materials, contrarily to the classical two-load method. In this\nmanner, the measured transfer matrices are applied into a proper modeling devoted to predict both\nthe operating frequency and the intrinsic TA amplification gain. Such parameters are optimized\nfor two basic TA engine models, either standing or traveling-wave configuration, by searching for\nthe corresponding geometrical parameters of the TAC surrounding components. A comparative\nanalysis shows in what conditions the TA threshold is expected or not for each material, but it also\nreveals the limitations of the experimental apparatus in what concerns the appropriate dimensions\nto better fit the performance investigations.\n\nKeywords: Thermoacoustics, Acoustics, Acoustic Impedance, Porous Materials, Resonance.\n\nxv\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nBANNWART, Fl\u00e1vio de Campos.

Faculdade de Engenharia Mec\u00e2nica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Cam-\npinas.\n\nLa conception d\u2019un moteur thermoacoustique d\u00e9pend de fa\u00e7on critique de la fiabilit\u00e9 des\noutils de pr\u00e9diction th\u00e9orique de ses performances. Une tentative pour r\u00e9ussir cette pr\u00e9diction con-\nsiste \u00e0 exploiter les coefficients de la matrice de transfert du noyau thermoacoustique (NTA) dans\nles mod\u00e8les analytiques du moteur consid\u00e9r\u00e9. La matrice de transfert elle-m\u00eame peut \u00eatre obtenue\nsoit par mod\u00e9lisation analytique, soit par des mesures acoustiques. Ce dernier cas, cependant, se\npr\u00e9sente comme une option int\u00e9ressante pour \u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la complexit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments\nconstitutifs du NTA, tant sur le plan de leur g\u00e9om\u00e9trie que des transferts thermiques qui y pren-\nnent place; le NTA est alors trait\u00e9 comme une bo\u00eete noire. La m\u00e9thode analytique est tout d\u2019abord\npr\u00e9sent\u00e9e; elle ne vise que les cas de mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 g\u00e9om\u00e9trie simple comme, par exemple, un cataly-\nseur en c\u00e9ramique. En ce qui concerne l\u2019approche exp\u00e9rimentale, trois proc\u00e9dures sont propos\u00e9es.\nUne m\u00e9thode classique \u00e0 deux charges est appliqu\u00e9e dans deux configurations diff\u00e9rentes et, en\noutre, une m\u00e9thode alternative bas\u00e9e sur des mesures d\u2019imp\u00e9dance est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e ici et appliqu\u00e9e\n\u00e9galement. Une comparaison entre ces deux approches est \u00e9valu\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019une analyse de sen-\nsibilit\u00e9, afin de se rendre compte de la faisabilit\u00e9 de chaque m\u00e9thode pour d\u2019autres exploitations.\nQuatre mat\u00e9riaux diff\u00e9rents sont test\u00e9s, chacun jouant le r\u00f4le de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment poreux \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du\nNTA utilis\u00e9 ; ils sont choisis de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 couvrir un large \u00e9ventail de porosit\u00e9s comprises entre le\npur stack et le pur r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur. Le NTA, \u00e0 son tour, est soumis \u00e0 plusieurs gradients de temp\u00e9rature\nen r\u00e9gime permanent. La m\u00e9thode bas\u00e9e sur des mesures d\u2019imp\u00e9dances s\u2019av\u00e8re performante pour\ntous les mat\u00e9riaux, contrairement \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode classique \u00e0 deux charges. Les matrices de transfert\nmesur\u00e9es sont utilis\u00e9es dans des mod\u00e8les d\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dire \u00e0 la fois la fr\u00e9quence de fonctionnement\net le gain d\u2019amplification thermoacoustique intrins\u00e8que d\u2019une machine thermoacoustique \u00e9quip\u00e9e\ndu NTA caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable. Ces param\u00e8tres sont optimis\u00e9s pour deux mod\u00e8les basiques de mo-\nteur thermoacoustique, que ce soit en configuration \u00e0 onde stationnaire ou progressive, en faisant\nvarier les param\u00e8tres g\u00e9om\u00e9triques des composants entourant le NTA. Une analyse comparative\nmontre dans quelles conditions le seuil de d\u00e9clenchement thermoacoustique est pr\u00e9vu ou non pour\nchaque mat\u00e9riau, mais elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi les limites de l\u2019appareil exp\u00e9rimental en ce qui concerne\nles dimensions appropri\u00e9es pour mieux r\u00e9pondre aux estimations de performances.\n\nMots-cl\u00e9: Thermoacoustique, Acoustique, Imp\u00e9dance Acoustique, Mat\u00e9riau poreux, R\u00e9sonance.\n\nxvii\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Schematic view of a thermoacoustic engine.

Like any thermodynamic machine, they have two\noperating modes depending on the direction of energy exchange: the engine mode for which the\nsystem uses the heat transfer from a hot source to a cold source to produce acoustic work and the\nheat-pump mode for which the system uses the acoustic energy produced by an external source\nto extract heat from a cold reservoir. The thermoacoustic effect on which the operation of these\nengines is based comes from the interaction between acoustic oscillations in a fluid and a tempera-\nture gradient imposed along the walls of a porous material (usually called \"stack\" or \"regenerator\",\ndepending on whether the heat contact is quasi-adiabatic or quasi-isothermal).\n\nThe development of efficient thermoacoustic engines is largely due to the work carried out\nat Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA), including the development of the software Delta-E\n(Ward, 1994) (then Delta-EC (Ward et al., 2008)). Delta-EC is a robust tool dedicated to the design\nof thermoacoustic systems and remains the most widely used tool to date. However, although it\nis suitable for calculating the performance of thermoacoustic machines, Delta-EC has some short-\ncomings implicitly related to the theory on which it is based. First, Delta-EC is based on a one-\ndimensional approach of the thermoacoustic effects and therefore does not take into account any\nvariation in transverse fields, which can play a significant role in the amplification process of the\nwave. Moreover the modeling of thermoacoustic instability is described in steady state and ignores\nthe transient regime which may contain important information about the non-linear processes re-\nsponsible for saturation (Swift, 1992; Yu et al., 2003; Penelet et al., 2002). Finally, Delta-EC is\nbased on the linear theory of thermoacoustics (Rott, 1980; Swift, 1988) and the only saturating\nprocesses taken into account are the acoustically induced heat flux and singular head losses at the\nedges of the stack. These limitations require the development of tools to describe what Delta-EC\ncan not predict and lead to the following questions: what theoretical approach can be adopted for\nthe description of the thermoacoustic amplification from the onset until the saturation amplitude?\nWhat methods can be used to avoid uni-dimensional considerations and simplifying assumptions\nregarding the distribution of temperature, the presence of heat exchangers or the thermophysical\nproperties of regenerators?\n\nIn response to the last question, the Laboratoire d\u2019Acoustique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Maine\n(LAUM) has recently launched work on the theoretical description and the design of thermoa-\n\n1\n\n\n\ncoustic engines, using the formalism of transfer matrices. In this context, the thermoacoustic core\n(TAC) is considered as a black box and its transfer matrix is obtained experimentally (Guedra et al.,\n2011). The TAC is the element of a thermoacoustic engine in which the temperature field is het-\nerogeneous. It is divided into an \u201cactive\u201d and a \u201cpassive\u201d part (Fig 1.1). The \u201cactive\u201d part consists\nof an open cell porous material (stack or regenerator) equipped with a hot (HHX) and an ambient\n(AHX) heat exchangers at its ends. These heat exchangers are used to maintain a steep temperature\ngradient, which is responsible for the onset of large amplitude acoustic waves oscillating at the\nfrequency of the most unstable acoustic mode of the complete device. The \u201cpassive\u201d part is the\nso-called thermal buffer tube (TBT), which refers to the waveguide region between the HHX and a\nsecondary AHX. The TAC is generally surrounded by an acoustical network to compose a resonant\ndevice in which a mechanical (acoustic) power is produced by thermoacoustic energy conversion.\nThis acoustic power can then be supplied to an acoustic load, e.g. an electrodynamic alternator, as\nillustrated in Fig. 1.1.\n\nEven below the threshold of thermoacoustic instability, the theoretical description of acoustic\npropagation and heat transfer through the thermoacoustic core (TAC) is anything but simple. This is\nessentially due to the fact that thermoacoustic engines make use of geometrically complicated ma-\nterials (piles of stainless meshes, metallic foams) whose thermophysical parameters are unknown.\nMoreover, the accuracy of the description of acoustic propagation through the TAC also depends\ncritically on the shape of the temperature field within the TAC, the latter being very difficult to\ndescribe theoretically. Therefore, alternative methods allowing the description of the TAC shall be\ndeveloped. In a previous study carried out in LAUM, a stack-based TAC has been characterized ex-\nperimentally. Guedra et al. (2011) performed the measurement of the transfer matrices of a heated\nTAC by means of a classical \"two load - four microphone\" method (Boden, 1986). These transfer\nmatrices were then introduced into an analytical model which predicts the onset of self-sustained\noscillations in a thermoacoustic device. Experimental data obtained from a stack made up of a 600\ncells per square inch (cpsi) ceramic catalyst have been introduced in the model and theoretical pre-\ndictions of the onset conditions were consistent with those actually observed in different engines\nequipped with this TAC. However, in the frame of this previous work, the method developed by\nGuedra et al. has not been tested to describe the behaviour of a heated regenerator-based TAC.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this thesis is twofold. First, in the continuation of the works by Guedra et\nal., it is to investigate alternative methods for the experimental characterization of a TAC, allowing\naccurate description of both stack-based and regenerator-based TAC made of different materials\nbesides the Ceramic Catalyst 600 cpsi, such as a Reticulated Vitreous Carbon Foam, a Nichrome\n\n2\n\n\n\nFoam, and a Pile of Stainless Steel Grids. Second, it is to introduce the experimental data obtained\nfrom these alternative methods into an analytical modeling for the optimal design of different kinds\nof thermoacoustic engines, and the estimation of the onset of self-sustained oscillations.\n\nAfter a brief history of thermoacoustics given in Chapter 1, the theoretical basis of thermoa-\ncoustics are recalled in Chapter 2. In particular, characteristic equations of thermoacoustic devices\nare derived using the formalism of the transfer matrices. The solution of such equation allows the\ndescription of the onset of self-sustained oscillations in a thermoacoustic engine (in terms of work-\ning frequency and amplification rate (Guedra et al., 2011)). This theoretical method requires the\nknowledge of the transfer matrix of the TAC. Different experimental procedures to measure the co-\nefficients of the transfer matrix (including the procedure developed by Guedra et al.) are presented\nand evaluated in Chapter 3. Finally, using the knowledge of the transfer matrices of different TAC\ntested in Chapter 3, the design of several thermoacoustic systems is discussed in Chapter 4.\n\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n???????????????\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n??????????????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?????? ??????\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??????\n????\n?????????? ??????\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n????\n????\n????\n\n????\n????\n??????\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n???? ????\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n?????\n?????\n?????\n?????\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n??\n??\n??\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n?????????\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??????\n\nHHX\n\nAHX\n\nregenerator\n\nT\nB\n\nT\n\nflow straighteners\n\nm\nov\n\nin\ng \n\nm\nas\n\ns\n\nfl\nex\n\nur\ne \n\nbe\nar\n\nin\ngs\n\nm\nag\n\nne\ntic\n\n m\not\n\nor\n\nT\nA\n\nC\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic view of a thermoacoustic engine. In this example, the acoustic load is a linear\nalternator.\n\n3\n\n\n\n1.1 Literature review and historical context\n\nThermoacoustic wave generators (or engines) are made of acoustic resonators in which the\ninteraction between acoustic and thermal oscillations in the vicinity of solid walls subjected to a\nhigh temperature gradient produces a conversion of thermal energy into acoustic energy. This ther-\nmoacoustic process aroused the interest of the scientific community of the late XVIIIth century\nwhen Byron Higgins succeeded in creating acoustic oscillations in a tube with a flame judiciously\nplaced on the wall of a resonator (Higgins, 1802). Other types of this kind of devices have been\nrealized in the late XIXth century since the Sondhauss tube (Sondhauss, 1850) or the Rijke\u2019s tube\n(Rijke, 1859). A first theory of thermoacoustic interaction (between acoustic and thermal fields)\nwas given in 1868 by Kirschhoff, who introduced the conduction of heat in the theory of sound\npropagation. Based on this work, a first qualitative interpretation of the Sondhauss tube was given\nby Lord Rayleigh in 1896 (Strutt, 1945). In this work, Rayleigh specially emphasizes that the acous-\ntical temperature oscillations of a fluid particle located near a wall subjected to a high temperature\ngradient must necessarily be phase-shifted with respect to the particle displacement, so that the\nthermoacoustic amplification process occurs. In his original words:\n\n\"In almost all cases where heat is communicated to a body expansion ensues, and this expan-\n\nsion may be made to do mechanical work. If the phases of the forces thus operative be favorable, a\n\nvibration may be maintained ... . For the sake of simplicity, a tube, hot at the closed end and getting\n\ngradually cooler towards the open end, may be considered. At a quarter of period before the phase\n\nof greatest condensation ... the air is moving inwards, i.e. towards the closed end, and therefore is\n\npassing from colder to hotter parts of the tube; ... but in fact the adjustment of temperature takes\n\ntime, and thus the temperature of the air deviates from that of the neighboring parts of the tube,\n\ninclining towards the temperature of that part of the tube from which the air has just come. From\n\nthis it follows that at the phase of greatest condensation heat is received by the air, and at the\n\nphase of greatest rarefaction heat is given up from it, and thus there is a tendency to maintain the\n\nvibrations.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, an important step was taken by Carter et al. (1962), who devised an \"optimized\"\nSondhauss tube by adding a stack of plates (stacks) in the resonator, thereby significantly increasing\nthe machine efficacy and efficiency. This device, schematically represented in Fig. 1.2, belongs to\nthe class of standing-wave thermoacoustic engine. In this system, when the temperature gradient\nalong the stack of plates reaches the instability threshold, self-sustained acoustic oscillations of high\n\n4\n\n\n\namplitude (about 1 to 10 percent of the static pressure) take place in the resonator at the frequency\nof the most unstable mode, which usually is, in a first approximation, the longitudinal half-wave\nmode.\n\nFigure 1.2: Scheme of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine with closed extremities and a repre-\nsentative example of a non-uniform temperature profile along its longitudinal axis.\n\nBased on Carter\u2019s work, many studies have been carried out ever since, and several proto-\ntypes of thermoacoustic engines have been realized. From 1970 to 1990, Rott (1969, 1973, 1980)\nestablished the theoretical foundations of thermoacoustics and provided an analytical model of the\ninstability caused by the thermoacoustic interaction in the tubes of Taconis and Sondhauss. The ex-\nperimental work of Yazaki et al. (1980a,b) qualitatively confirmed the validity of the theory of Rott.\nSince the early 1980s, research in thermoacoustic intensifies, notably through the work carried out\nat the Los Alamos National Laboratory (e.g. Swift (1988)). If the thermoacoustic processes could\nhave been considered at first as a simple scientific curiosity, its use as a converter of thermal energy\ninto mechanical energy constitutes a real challenge itself. Indeed, there are many potential applica-\ntions of this kind of machines combining simplicity, robustness and reasonable efficiency (Garrett,\n2004). Since then, efforts have been made to improve the performance of either thermoacoustic\ndevices. That led, for example, to the development of a cascade thermocoustic engine (Gardner,\n2003), where the overall engine efficiency is enhanced by means of combining several elementary\nengines, to better use the available energy. In this sense, de Blok (2010) developed a power genera-\ntor where only a low temperature difference is required to make it work; such a system has a strong\nenvironmental impact since it allows the harvesting of waste heat. Simultaneously, important ef-\nforts have been made towards the thermoacoustic efficiency by improving the comprehension of the\n\n5\n\n\n\nnonlinear processes involved when the acoustic wave saturation occurs in thermoacoustic engines\n(Penelet, 2004; Penelet et al., 2002), and also by developing models for the temperature distribution\nalong their heated sections (Penelet et al., 2005b,a).\n\n1.2 Thermoacoustic principle\n\nThe process of interaction between a fluid and a solid wall resulting in the conversion of\nthermal energy into acoustic energy involves complex processes and requires accurate modeling\n(Bailliet, 1998; Job, 2001; Rott, 1980). However, a simplified approach allows to understanding the\nmain mechanisms involved in the apparatus of Fig. 1.2. For that, it is considered a fluid particle\nin the vicinity of a solid wall of the stack, along which a strong temperature gradient ?T is set\n(Fig. 1.3 (a)). The temperature of the particle at rest, under a given static pressure P0, is imposed\nby the presence of the wall (whose thermal inertia is assumed to be very large compared with that\nof the fluid). Supposing that the thermodynamic state of the particle fluctuates under the influence\nof a sinusoidal stationary sound field, thus this particle oscillates in a consequent sinusoidal mo-\ntion, to which are associated small oscillations of sound pressure p(t) (p&lt;&lt;P0) in phase with the\nacoustic particle displacement ?(t) (or in phase quadrature with the acoustic velocity). The acoustic\npressure oscillations are associated with temperature oscillations; the latter which are assumed, in\na first approximation, in phase with the first ones (Fig. 1.4 (a), solid line). This is a valid hypothesis\nwhen the particle motion is under quasi-adiabatic conditions, which means temperature oscillations\nsmall enough (and fast enough either) to render negligible the heat transport between adjacent par-\nticles. As an illustrative example of the orders of magnitude involved, a particle of air submitted\nto a sinusoidal free field at a frequency of 1kHz, whose pressure level reaches the pain thresh-\nold of the human ear (Pmax = 20Pa), has its amplitude of temperature oscillations reaching only\nTmax ? 10?2K, and its displacement amplitude ?max is of the order of 10?5m. That stated, each\nthermodynamical process follows a harmonic cycle. However, an additional simplification helps\nto understanding of fundamental physical phenomena involved. That would be the particle motion\nbeing represented no longer by a sinusoidal temporal profile, but actually by a square profile in-\nstead (Fig. 1.4 (a), dashed line). Four phases are then clearly distinguished in one cycle: adiabatic\ncompression, isobaric expansion, adiabatic expansion, and isobaric compression. The adiabatic\ncondition is approximated whether these processes are considered sufficiently fast, while the heat\ntransfer occurs during the isobaric processes between the fluid particle and the wall solid surface.\nThe cycle followed by the particle has its shape shown in Fig. 1.3 (b)-(e), when the temperature\n\n6\n\n\n\ngradient ?T applied to the wall is such that ?max?T > ?max. Thus, the particle receives a quantity\nof heat Q during its compression phase and returns a quantity of heat Q? during its expansion phase.\nThis same cycle in four phases can be represented schematically following a Clapeyron diagram\n(Fig. 1.4 (b) and (c)). It then becomes clear that during the motion of the particle, a quantity of heat\nQ?Q? has been converted into mechanical work (i.e. acoustic energy), represented by the shaded\narea.\n\nFigure 1.3: Engine cycle followed by a fluid particle under the influence of an acoustic standing\nwave in the vicinity of a solid wall which is subjected to a temperature gradient ? T. (a) Particle\ninitially at rest. (b) Adiabatic compression. (c) Isobaric expansion. (d) Adiabatic expansion. (e)\nIsobaric contraction.\n\nIn reality, the heat exchange mechanism between fluid and wall is of course far more com-\nplex than suggested by the previous remarks. In fact, to fully understand the real thermoacoustic\namplification process, special attention must be paid to the phase relations between oscillations of\npressure, particle velocity and acoustic temperature. As indicated above, the temperature variations\nof a fluid particle are related to its compression-relaxation and the local wall temperature. The dis-\ntance between fluid particle and wall is therefore an important parameter regarding the nature of\nheat exchange process: \"far\" from the wall, the process is adiabatic and the temperature oscillates\nover time and phase with the acoustic pressure; \"close\" by the wall, the process is isothermal and\nthe fluid particle has its temperature imposed at each instant by the local temperature of the wall.\nBut for a particle of fluid located at a distance of the order of a boundary layer thickness ?? of the\n\n7\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: (a) Sinusoidal and \"articulated\" time evolution, respectively represented by solid lines\nand dotted lines, of the acoustic variables of pressure (p), temperature (?) and displacement (?)\nfor an acoustic standing wave. Points O, A, B, C and D correspond to the states (a), (b), (c), (d)\nand (e) of Fig. 1.3. (b) Clapeyron diagram of an \"articulated\" acoustic cycle. (c) \"Real\" Clapeyron\ndiagram.\n\nwall, the thermal contact between particle and wall is \"good enough\" for the heat exchange to take\nplace, but \"bad enough\" for this heat exchange to not result in an instantaneous change of temper-\nature in the fluid particle; actually, at this intermediary region there is a delay in the heat exchange,\nor, more precisely, a phase shift between particle motion and heat transfer (?? =\n\n?\n2?/?, where\n\n?? is the thermal penetration depth, ? is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid, and ? is the angular\nfrequency). This is indeed the phase shift between oscillations of temperature and acoustic pressure\nthat is responsible for the energy conversion, and the cycle followed by the particle is analogous to\nthe diagram in Fig. 1.4 (c). In summary , only fluid particles located at a distance of the order of\na thermal boundary layer thickness effectively contribute to the thermoacoustic energy conversion.\nTherefore, a stack whose pores (i.e. inter-wall distance) are properly sized for the distance ?? is\noptimized for the thermoacoustic conversion, since the amount of \"effective\" fluid is maximized.\n\nTo resume, this cycle approaches to an ideal Brayton cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5, and\ntherefore it operates in an intrinsically irreversible cycle due to the finite temperature difference in\nthe heat transfer processes. This cycle results in a positive acoustic work production, like a thermal\nengine. However, as well known from the laws of thermodynamics, an inversion in its processes\nleads the system to operate as a \"heat pump\". Indeed, it clearly appears on the schematic cycle of\nFig. 1.3 that if the temperature gradient applied along the wall is such that ?max?T &lt;?max, the\norientation of thermoacoustic heat transfer from one end of the stack to another is inverted (here,\nfrom left to right), so that a temperature gradient is established and maintained along the stack.\n\n8\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The ideal Brayton cycle with the corresponding states of Fig. 1.4.\n\nIn the case of traveling-wave systems, the thermoacoustic principle operates differently. The\nmain difference relies in the fact that the acoustic pressure and the volume velocity are in phase\n(and the displacement is ?/2 rad out of phase with the acoustic pressure, consequently), what\nleads to approximate to an isothermal heat transfer between the fluid particle and the solid wall.\nThis feature leads the cycle to approach to a Stirling cycle, which is ideally reversible. To enhance\nthis approximation, the fluid particle must oscillate in very close thermal contact with the solid\nsurfaces of the porous material, whose pores therefore result much thinner than in the case of\nstanding-wave systems. Besides, the porous material shall possess a higher thermal conductivity,\nso as to allow an adequate oscillating heat transfer in such a condition; that promotes a regenerative\ncycle. As a consequence, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic systems tend to be, in principle, more\nefficient than the standing-wave ones. However, there are some disadvantages that may risk this\npreponderance and should be managed, such as the higher susceptibility to acoustic streaming and\nviscous losses due to the smaller pores, among others.\n\nAnalogously to Figs. 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic cycle is displayed\nin Fig. 1.6. Figure 1.6 (a) shows the following six ideal processes: A-B: reversible adiabatic com-\npression; B-C: isothermal and reversible heat transfer; C-D: reversible adiabatic expansion; D-E:\nreversible adiabatic expansion; E-F: isothermal and reversible heat transfer; F-A: reversible adia-\nbatic compression. All these processes are in accordance with Figs. 1.6 (b) and 1.6 (c).\n\n9\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: (a) Engine cycle followed by a fluid particle under the influence of an acoustic traveling\nwave in the vicinity of a solid wall which is subjected to a temperature gradient ?

Funda-\nmental equations governing thermoacoustics are presented in Section 2.1. Then, analytical expres-\nsions are given for the transfer matrices of several acoustic two-ports submitted (Section 2.3) or not\nsubmitted (Section 2.2) to a temperature distribution. Lastly, Section 2.4 is devoted to the charac-\nteristic equation of a thermoacoustic device.\n\n2.1 Fundamental equations of thermoacoustics\n\n2.1.1 Primary equations of dissipative fluids\n\nThe movement of a fluid particle is described by the following set of equations:\n\n- the conservation of mass equation,\n\n??\n\n?t\n+\n??\n5\u00b7 (?~v) = 0, (2.1)\n\nwhere ? is the density of the fluid and ~v is the particle velocity,\n\n- the Navier-Stokes vectorial equations expressing the conservation of momentum\n\n?\nd~v\n\ndt\n= ?\n??\n5p + \u00b5\n\n??\n52~v +\n\n(\n\u00b5v +\n\n\u00b5\n\n3\n\n)??\n5(\n??\n5\u00b7~v), (2.2)\n\nwhere p is the acoustic pressure and where \u00b5 and \u00b5v are the dynamic shear and volume\nviscosities, respectively\n\nand, the equation of energy conservation\n\n11\n\n\n\n?T\ndS\n\ndt\n=\n??\n5\u00b7 (?\n\n??\n5T) + ? \u00b75(~v) (2.3)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the fluid, S is the entropy, ? represents the thermal conductivity\nof the fluid and ? is the stress tensor.\n\nThese conservation equations (Eqs. (2.1) to (2.3)) are complemented by the following state\nrelations considering the fluid as a perfect gas:\n\nd? = ?\n?\n\nT\ndT +\n\n?\n\nc20\ndp, (2.4)\n\ndS =\nCp\nT\ndT ?\n\n1\n\n?T\ndp, (2.5)\n\nwhere ? = Cp\nCv\n\nis the polytropic coefficient of the fluid, where c0 =\n?\n\n?RgT\n\nMmol\nis the adiabatic\n\nspeed of sound (Mmol being the molar mass of the fluid and Rg = 8.314J.mol?1.K?1 red the\nperfect gas constant) and where Cp and Cv are the isobaric and the isochoric heat capacity of the\nfluid, respectively.\n\n2.1.2 Simplifying hypotheses\n\nIt is considered that the acoustic propagation occurs in a cylindrical tube (corresponding,\nfor example, to a stack pore). The diagram given in Fig. 2.1 shows the geometry of the problem\nconsidered. The coordinate x represents the direction of acoustic propagation in a volume of fluid\nlocated within a cylinder of radius R; y is the transversal coordinate, and r is the radial coordinate.\nIn the following, the dimensionless transverse coordinate ? is hereby introduced:\n\n? =\nr\n\nR\n(0 ? ? ? +1). (2.6)\n\n12\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Coordinate system used for the problem modeling.\n\nIn order to obtain analytical expressions for the acoustic variables, a number of assumptions\nshall be formulated. In the framework of linear or weakly non-linear acoustics, the thermodynamic\nvariables are expressed using a method of successive approximations in the form:\n\n? = ?0 + ??1 + ?\n2?2 + O(?\n\n3), (2.7)\n\nwhere ? represents either the pressure p, the density ?, the temperature T , the entropy S or\nthe three components of the particle velocity ~v, and where ? is a small parameter (? ? 1) reflecting\nthe magnitude of each term.\n\nIn Eq. (2.7), the zero-order terms are the static components of the thermodynamic variables.\nAmong them, the static pressure p0 is assumed to be constant and uniform, and the temperature\nT0(x) is assumed to be inhomogeneous in the x direction of wave propagation. The spatial temper-\nature distribution also implies taking into account spatial variations of density ?0(x) and entropy\nS0(x). Finally, the fluid is assumed initially at rest in the absence of acoustic disturbances so that\n~v0 = ~0.\n\nThe first-order terms in Eq. (2.7) correspond to acoustic fluctuations, which are very low in\ncomparison to the static components. Under the assumption of a harmonic plane wave propagating\nin the x direction and using the time convention ?i?t, it is possible to write the acoustic variables\nas\n\n13\n\n\n\np1(x,t) =&lt;\n{\np?1(x)e\n\n?i?t} , (2.8)\nfor the acoustic pressure, and\n\n?1(x,?,t) =&lt;\n{\n??1(x,?)e\n\n?i?t\n}\n, (2.9)\n\nwhere &lt;is \"the real part of \", and ?1 represents the acoustic part of either the density ?1,\nthe temperature ?1, the entropy s1 or the three components of the particle velocity ~v1. In Eqs. (2.8)\nand (2.9), ? is the acoustic pulsation, and the symbol ? denotes for the complex amplitudes of the\nacoustic variables.\n\nThe second-order terms are not taken into account here, but must be considered to describe\nhigher order effects, such as acoustic streaming (Bailliet et al., 2001; Guedra, 2012b), for example.\n\nAt last, under the boundary layer approximation, the transverse component of the particle\nvelocity is assumed to be very small compared to the longitudinal component (|v1,?|? |v1,x|), and\nlongitudinal variations of variables ?1(x,?) are assumed to be small compared to the transverse\nvariations (?x ? ?r).\n\n2.1.3 Propagation equation governing the acoustic pressure\n\nAccording to the asumptions mentioned above, the Navier-Stokes equation, Eq. (2.2), applied\nto the x component of the particle velocity, v?1,x, reduces to\n\n? i??0v?1,x = ?\n?p?1\n?x\n\n+\n\u00b5\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n(\n?\n?v?1,x\n??\n\n)\n. (2.10)\n\nIntegrating Eq. (2.10) across the transverse variable, and taking into account a non-slip con-\ndition on the walls (v?1,x(? = 1) = 0), the solution of Eq. (2.10) for the longitudinal component of\nthe acoustic velocity can be written as\n\n14\n\n\n\nv?1,x(x,?) =\n1\n\ni??0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\n(1 ?F?(?)) . (2.11)\n\nThe function F? in Eq. (2.11) depends on the geometry under consideration and accounts\nfor the viscous effects (Rott, 1980; Swift, 1988; Arnott et al., 1991). In the particular case of a\ncylindrical guide of radius R, the function F? takes the form:\n\nF?(?) =\nJ0\n\n(\n(1 + i)?R\n\n??\n\n)\nJ0\n\n(\n(1 + i) R\n\n??\n\n) pour 0 ? ? ? 1, (2.12)\nwhere J0 is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. Equivalent expressions for F?\n\ncan be obtained for guides with other section geometries, like rectangular, triangular, or, specially,\nfor stacked plates (Arnott et al., 1991). Equation (2.12) introduces the critical parameter in ther-\nmoacoustics, namely the ratio between the hydraulic radius and the viscous penetration depth (the\nthermal penetration depth is analogous); in this case of the cylindrical pore, the hydraulic radius is\ntaken into account by the transversal dimension R of the channel, and the viscous penetration depth\n?? =\n\n?\n2?\n?\n\ndepends on the frequency and on the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ? = \u00b5\n?0\n\n.\n\nThe linearization of the equation of heat transfer, Eq. (2.3), and of the state equations, Eqs.\n(2.4) and (2.5), lead to expressions of the acoustic variables ??1, ??1 and s?1 as functions of the acoustic\npressure and its spatial derivatives, as following:\n\n??1(x,?) =\np?1\n?0Cp\n\n[1 ?F?(?)] ?\n1\n\n?2?0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?F?(?) ?F?(?)\n? ? 1\n\n]\n, (2.13)\n\n??1(x,?) =\np?1\nc20\n\n[1 + (? ? 1)F?(?)] +\n1\n\n?2\n?p?1\n?x\n\nT?10\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?F?(?) ?F?(?)\n? ? 1\n\n]\n, (2.14)\n\ns?1(x,?) = ?\np?1\n?0T0\n\nF?(?) ?\nCp\n?2?0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\nT?10\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?F?(?) ?F?(?)\n? ? 1\n\n]\n, (2.15)\n\nwhere ? = ?\n?\n\nis the Prandtl number and where the function F? accounts for thermal effects.\nThis function is defined analogously to F? [cf. Eq. (2.12) for a cylindrical guide], ?? being replaced\n\n15\n\n\n\nby the thermal penetration depth ?? =\n?\n\n2?\n?\n\n, where ? is the fluid thermal diffusivity.\n\nAt last, from Eqs. (2.11), (2.13), (2.14) and (2.15), and introducing thermo-viscous functions\naveraged over the guide transverse coordinate,\n\nf?,? = 2\n\n? 1\n0\n\nF?,??d?, (2.16)\n\nthe averaged acoustic variables are obtained in the following forms:\n\n?v?1,x?(x) =\n1\n\ni??0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\n(1 ?f?) , (2.17)\n\n???1?(x) =\np?1\n?0Cp\n\n[1 ?f?] ?\n1\n\n?2?0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?f? ?f?\n? ? 1\n\n]\n, (2.18)\n\n???1?(x) =\np?1\nc20\n\n[1 + (? ? 1)f?] +\n1\n\n?2\n?p?1\n?x\n\nT?10\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?f? ?f?\n? ? 1\n\n]\n, (2.19)\n\n?s?1?(x) = ?\np?1\n?0T0\n\nf? ?\nCp\n?2?0\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\nT?10\n?T0\n?x\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n?f? ?f?\n? ? 1\n\n]\n. (2.20)\n\nIn the case of a cylindrical guide, substituting F? (respectively F?) by its expression of Eq.\n(2.12) into Eq. (2.16) leads to the analytical expression for the thermo-viscous function f? (respec-\ntively f?):\n\nf?,? =\n2??,?\n\n(1 + i)R\n\nJ1\n\n(\n(1 + i) R\n\n??,?\n\n)\nJ0\n\n(\n(1 + i) R\n\n??,?\n\n), (2.21)\nwhere J1 is the first-order Bessel function of first kind.\n\nThe substitution of Eqs. (2.17) and (2.19) into the equation of mass conservation of Eq. (2.1)\nlinearized and averaged over the coordinate ? leads to the propagation equation for sound pressure\nin a dissipative medium in the presence of a temperature gradient:\n\n16\n\n\n\n?2p?1\n?x2\n\n+\n\n[\n?xT0\nT0\n\n(\n1 +\n\nf? ?f?\n(? ? 1)(1 ?f?)\n\n)\n?\n\n?xf?\n1 ?f?\n\n]\n?p?1\n?x\n\n+ k20\n\n(\n1 + (? ? 1)f?\n\n1 ?f?\n\n)\np?1 = 0, (2.22)\n\nwhere k0 =\n?\nc0\n\nrepresents the lossless wavenumber. This differential equation is equivalent\nto that given by Rott (1969) and Swift (1988, 2002) for an ideal gas and assuming that the fluid\nthermal effusivity is negligible compared with that of the solid. When the temperature distribution\nT0(x) is known, the solution of this differential equation can be obtained either numerically (Ward,\n1994; Ward et al., 2008) or analytically in an implicit form by transforming the equation (2.22) in\na Volterra integral equation of the second kind (Gusev et al., 2000; Job, 2001).\n\n2.2 Analytical expressions for the transfer matrix of acoustic two-port\n\nA thermoacoustic system can be seen as an assembly of several elements designated as acous-\ntic two-ports. In its simplest arrangement, an engine is a combination of a thermoacoustic core\n(TAC) and a set of waveguides with various geometries (either cylindrical, rectangular, or another\none). Each of these acoustic two-ports may be (or not) submitted to an inhomogeneous temperature\ndistribution.\n\nTo describe the propagation of an acoustic wave in a thermoacoustic engine, each acoustic\ntwo-port may be characterized by its transfer matrix (Guedra, 2012a; Ueda, 2008; Tu et al., 2003).\nIn this section, the analytical expression of the transfer matrix is derived in the case of a straight\nduct, a porous material, and a tapered waveguide, as these are the classical two-ports generally used\nfor the design of a themoacoustic engine. The temperature distribution along these elements is first\nconsidered homogeneous. The case of a non-uniform temperature distribution is treated in Sec. 2.3.\n\nSurely, powerful thermoacoustic engines do not consist of only such basic elements. They\nalso include parts of more complex geometries (Backhaus, 1999, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2004),\nallowing either a diminution of nonlinear losses by means of semi-empirical design (jet pumps,\ntapered tubes) or the improvement of the efficiency the system. The experimental determination of\nthe transfer matrix of such complex elements with a non-uniform temperature distribution is the\nsubject of the next chapter.\n\n17\n\n\n\nu1\n\np1 p2\n\nu2\n\nFigure 2.2: Adopted pressure-volume velocity convention for the quadripole description; anti-\nsymmetric orientation.\n\n2.2.1 Conventions\n\nIn the following, the longitudinal dimension of the two-port is denoted by d and the coordinate\nsystem is defined so that the entrance of the two-port is placed at the origin x = 0 and its output at\nx = d, with the plane wave propagation following the ~Ox axis. As illustrated in Fig. 2.2, the volume\nvelocity u?1,x(0) at the entrance of the quadrupole is counted positive, while u?1,x(d) is positive as\nwell, but located at the exit (anti-symmetric orientation).\n\nThe transfer matrix of the two-port corresponding to Fig. 2.2 is thus defined as following:\n\n(\np?1(d)\n\nu?1,x(d)\n\n)\n=\n\n(\na b\n\nc d\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(0)\n\nu?1,x(0)\n\n)\n= T \u00d7\n\n(\np?1(0)\n\nu?1,x(0)\n\n)\n. (2.23)\n\n2.2.2 Case of a straight waveguide\n\nThe Equation (2.22) defined in Section 2.1 describes the propagation of a plane wave along\nthe waveguide in the presence of a longitudinal temperature distribution. When the temperature\nprofile is assumed to be constant and equal to the ambient temperature Tc (?xT0 = 0 and ?xf? = 0\nbecause the dynamic viscosity \u00b5 and the fluid density ?0 do not depend on x) this equation becomes\n\n?2p?1\n?x2\n\n+ k2p?1 = 0, (2.24)\n\n18\n\n\n\nwhere the complex wavenumber\n\nk = k0\n\n?\n1 + (? ? 1)f?\n\n1 ?f?\n(2.25)\n\ntakes into account the viscous-thermal coupling between the fluid and the waveguide walls\nby means of the f? and f? functions. The general solution of Eq. (2.24) is writing\n\np?1 = A?e\n+ikx + B?e?ikx. (2.26)\n\nSubstituting this solution into Eq. (2.17) allows writing the axial component of the particle\nvelocity averaged over the guide section in the form\n\n?v?1,x? =\n\n?\n1+(??1)f?\n\n1?f?\n\n?0c0\n(1 ?f?)\n\n(\nA?e+ikx ? B?e?ikx\n\n)\n. (2.27)\n\nIntroducing the guide cross section S and knowing that u?1,x = S?v?1,x?, the volume velocity\nis then given below\n\nu?1,x =\n1\n\nZc\n\n(\nA?e+ikx ? B?e?ikx\n\n)\n. (2.28)\n\nwhere Zc is the characteristic complex impedance of the waveguide defined by\n\nZc =\n?0c0\n\nS\n?\n\n(1 ?f?)(1 + (? ? 1)f?)\n. (2.29)\n\nFinally, Eqs. (2.26) and (2.28) expressed for x = 0 lead to the determination of the complex\namplitudes A? and B? :\n\n19\n\n\n\nA? =\np?1(0) + Zcu?1,x(0)\n\n2\n, (2.30)\n\nB? =\np?1(0) ?Zcu?1,x(0)\n\n2\n. (2.31)\n\nUsing these relations into Eqs. (2.26) and (2.28) expressed for x = d allows to derive the\nanalytical expression of the transfer matrix T of the guide below:\n\nT ?\n\n(\ncos(kwd) iZc sin(kwd)\n\niZ?1c sin(kwd) cos(kwd)\n\n)\n. (2.32)\n\n2.2.3 Case of a porous element\n\nTo ensure a temperature gradient along the stack/regenerator, thermoacoustic engines often\nincorporate heat exchangers constituted of porous material which includes a heating or cooling\nsystem. Unlike the stack or the regenerator, the thermal gradient along the heat exchangers may\nbe neglected in first approximation without implicating major errors in this modeling. Exchangers\nare generally modeled as porous elements at a constant hot or ambient temperature, which are\nrespectively TH or TC.\n\nThe transfer matrix of such an element is deduced from the matrix of Eq. (2.32):\n\nT ?\n\n(\ncos(keqd) iZeq sin(keqd)\n\niZ?1eq sin(keqd) cos(keqd)\n\n)\n. (2.33)\n\nUsing the equivalent wavenumber\n\nkeq = k0\n\n?\n1 + (? ? 1)f(r0)?\n\n1 ?f(r0)?\n(2.34)\n\n20\n\n\n\nand the equivalent characteristic impedance\n\nZeq =\n?0c0\n\n?S\n\n?\n(1 ?f(r0)? )(1 + (? ? 1)f(r0)? )\n\n, (2.35)\n\nwhere ? is the porosity and where the functions f(r0)? and f\n(r0)\n? take into account the viscous-\n\nthermal coupling between the fluid and the pore walls of a characteristic transverse dimension\nr0. For example, in the case of a network of cylindrical pores, the analytical expressions of these\nfunctions are given by Eq. (2.21) replacing R by r0.\n\n2.2.4 Case of a tapered waveguide\n\nMost studied thermoacoustic engines incorporate adaptive conical parts connecting waveg-\nuide sections (Chen, 1999; Backhaus, 2000; Biwa et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2003; Hao et al., 2011).\nThese conical parts affect the distribution of acoustic fields.\n\nIn accordance with the notations used so far, the cone is defined as a waveguide of radius R\nthat varies linearly between R0 = R(0) and Rd = R(d) (see Fig. 2.2). The analytical expression of\nthe transfer matrix of a conical two-port can be found in the reference (Mechel, 2008) for different\nwriting conventions than those adopted in this manuscript. For clarity, this analytical expression is\nrewritten from (Mechel, 2008) as:\n\n(\na b\n\nc d\n\n)\n?\n\n?\n????\n\nz1\nz2\n\ncos(kwd) +\nsin(kwd)\n\nkwz2\niZc\n\nz2\nz1\n\nsin(kwd)\n\niZ?1c\n\n[\nz1\nz2\n\n(\n1 + 1\n\nk2wz1z2\n\n)\nsin(kwd) ?\n\n(\n1 ? z1\n\nz2\n\n) cos(kwd)\nkwz2\n\n]\nz2\nz1\n\ncos(kwd) ?\nsin(kwd)\n\nkwz1\n\n?\n???? ,\n\n(2.36)\n\nwith z1 =\nR0\n\nR0?Rd\nd, z2 = z1+d and where the wave number k and the characteristic impedance\n\nZc are respectively given by equations Eq. (2.25) and Eq. (2.29) [with S = ?R2d in Eq. (2.29)].\nHowever, it should be noted that Eq. (2.36), outcome from Mechel (2008) , is initially derived from\n\n21\n\n\n\nthe equation of Webster without loss. Taking into account the losses (which depend strictly on R)\nwould imply to solve a wave equation similar to that of linear thermoacoustics [Eq. (2.22)], whose\nsolution is more demanding than in Eq. (2.36). That means, in other words, that the analytical\nexpression (2.36) is an approximation of acoustic propagation in a cone with parietal losses, with\nfunctions f? et f? performing in expressions (2.25) and (2.29) evaluated for R = (R0 + Rd)/2.\n\n2.3 Analytical expression for the transfer matrix of an acoustic two-port submitted\nto a non-uniform temperature distribution\n\nTo describe the propagation of harmonic plane waves in an acoustic two-port subject to an\ninhomogeneous distribution of temperature T0(x), the differential equation of second order, Eq.\n(2.22), with non-constant coefficients has to be solved. Gusev et al. proposed an exact analytical\nsolution of this equation in the form of an infinite series of integral operators (Gusev et al., 2000;\nJob, 2001; Penelet et al., 2005b; Penelet, 2004). Them, Eq. (2.22) is rewritten as\n\n?2p?1\n?x2\n\n+\nd?1\ndx\n\n?p?1\n?x\n\n+\n\n(\n?\n\nc0\n\n)2\n?0p?1 = 0, (2.37)\n\nwhere c0 = c0(Tc) is the adiabatic speed of sound at room temperature, and where the func-\ntions\n\nd?1\ndx\n\n=\ndxT0\nT0\n\n(\n1 +\n\nf? ?f?\n(? ? 1)(1 ?f?)\n\n)\n?\n\ndxf?\n1 ?f?\n\n, (2.38)\n\n?0 =\nTc\nT0\n\n(\n1 + (? ? 1)f?\n\n1 ?f?\n\n)\n, (2.39)\n\ndepend on x through the temperature T0 (and thermophysical properties of the fluid).\n\nIntroducing the spatial variable ? defined by\n\n22\n\n\n\nd?\n\ndx\n= ?x = e\n\n(?1(0)??1(x)), (2.40)\n\nand the function\n\nF(?) = ?0(x(?))?\n?2\nx , (2.41)\n\nthe propagation Equation (2.37) becomes\n\nd2p?1\nd?2\n\n+ k20F(?)p?1 = 0, (2.42)\n\nwith k0 = ?/c0(Tc). By successive integrations of the coordinate ? , Eq. (2.42) is rewritten\nin the form of a system of integral equations\n\np?1(?) = p?1(0) +\n\n? ?\n0\n\ndp?1\nd??\n\nd??, (2.43)\n\ndp?1\nd?\n\n=\ndp?1\nd?\n\n????\n0\n\n?k20\n? ?\n\n0\n\nF(??)p?1(?\n?)d??.

(2.46)\n\nFinally, using successive approximations to calculate the terms on the left of Eqs. (2.43) and\n(2.44), the exact solution of this system can be written in matrix form showing infinite series of\n\n23\n\n\n\noperators ?1 and ?2 (Penelet et al., 2005b; Penelet, 2004):\n\n(\np?1(?)\ndp?1\nd?\n\n(?)\n\n)\n=\n\n( ??\nn=0 (?2?1)\n\nn ?2\nik0\n\n??\nn=0 (?1?2)\n\nn\n\nik0?1\n??\n\nn=0 (?2?1)\nn ??\n\nn=0 (?1?2)\nn\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(0)\ndp?1\nd?\n\n(0)\n\n)\n, (2.47)\n\nwhere the terms of the infinite series are defined in the following way 1:\n\n(?2?1)\nn\ny = ?2\n\n(\n?1\n\n(\n. . . ?2\n\n(\n?1? ?? ?\n\nn times\n\n(y)\n)))\n\n. (2.48)\n\nBy using the relation of Eq.

(2.51)\n\n1It is important to note that, with a gradient of non-zero temperature, the integral operators ?1 and ?2 are not\ncommutative and the diagonal elements of the matrix defined by (2.47) are not equal. However, this equality appears\nwhen dxT0 = 0, particular case where ?1 and ?2 are set to a multiplicative constant.\n\n24\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: (a) Sketch of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine. (b) Open end. (c) Closed end. (d)\nCoupling with a electrodynamic alternator.\n\nThe Eq. (2.50) is valid either for a stack or the passive part of the core, simply evaluating\nthe thermo-viscous functions for a narrow channel of radius r1 or a wide channel of radius R,\nrespectively (with S 7? ?S for a porous element). It should be noted that the Eq. (2.50) for a\nwide guide or a stack tends to asymptotically approach the expressions (2.32) and (2.33) when the\ntemperature is constant along the two-port.\n\n2.4 Characteristic equation of a thermoacoustic device\n\n2.4.1 Case of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine\n\nStanding-wave thermoacoustic systems generally consist of a straight waveguide wherein the\nresonance of a fluid column occurs, and also of heat exchangers, as represented in Fig. 2.3. Those\n\n25\n\n\n\nsystems are simple and reliable, but not efficient. Although they are of little interest for industrial\napplications because of their low yield, the study of these systems is essential from an academic\npoint of view, to better understand the complex phenomena involved in the thermoacoustic operat-\ning machines.\n\nThe low performance of standing-wave engines is implicitly associated to the stationary na-\nture of the fluid particle oscillation in the vicinity of the solid wall. Indeed, such acoustic cycle\nconsists of thermodynamic processes similar to those of a Brayton cycle (adiabatic compression\n- isobaric expansion - adiabatic expansion/relaxation - isobaric contraction), whose performance\nis intrinsically lower than that of Carnot type. Therefore, to approach what would be considered\nadiabatic processes, an imperfect thermal contact between the fluid and solid walls is required. To\noptimize such imperfection in favor of cycle performance, a trade-off between the particle speed\nand its position in the thermal and viscous boundary layers shall be found, as they are inversely\nproportional. Employing a stack in these machines requires the pore radius to be of the order of\nmagnitude of a thermal penetration depth (rs ? ??). This type of engine has been extensively stud-\nied in the literature (Swift, 2002, 1988, 1992; Atchley, 1992; Atchley et al., 1992; Atchley, 1994b;\nChen, 1999; Hao et al., 2011) and, although being potentially less attractive than the traveling-wave\nsystem, it still remains explorable even if the investigation involves complex acoustic phenomena\nof difficult theoretical prediction.\n\nUsing the formalism of transfer matrices, it is possible to write the equation relating the\nacoustic pressure and flow at x = 0 and x = L in the form:\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n= Tr \u00d7TTAC \u00d7Tl \u00d7\n\n(\np?1(0)\n\nu?1,x(0)\n\n)\n, (2.52)\n\nwhere Tl and Tr are the transfer matrices of the tube portions at ambient temperature Tc,\nrespectively at left and right side of the thermoacoustic core, and where TTAC is the transfer matrix\nof the thermoacoustic core (i.e. the part of the system subjected to an inhomogeneous distribution\ntemperature), which is defined as follows:\n\nTTAC ?\n\n(\nTpp(?,T0(x)) Tpu(?,T0(x))\nTup(?,T0(x)) Tuu(?,T0(x))\n\n)\n. (2.53)\n\n26\n\n\n\nThe transfer matrix TTAC depends on the geometric and thermophysical properties of the\nthermoacoustic core that are linked to its constitutive elements, namely stack, passive part, and\nheat exchangers. Nevertheless, it also depends on other factors such as temperature distribution\nT0(x) along both stack (x ? [xs,xh]) and passive part (x ? [xh,xw]), and on the acoustic pulsation\n?. When the temperature distribution is known, TTAC can be obtained theoretically (Job, 2001;\nPenelet et al., 2005b; Penelet, 2004), as it has been presented in the last section. However, this\nmatrix can also be measured under different heating conditions, as it will be shown and explored in\nChapter 3.\n\n2.4.2 Case of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine\n\nThe so-called traveling-wave thermoacoustic systems are characterized by the presence of a\nfeedback loop favoring the amplification of traveling waves. These machines evoke the interest of\nthe thermoacoustician community mostly by reason of their performances, often much higher than\nthose which could be reached by an equivalent standing-wave system. This potentially high return\nis a result of the thermodynamic cycle to which the fluid particle is subjected. Its movement near\na solid wall approximately follows the Stirling cycle, whose ideal efficiency is that of Carnot\u2019s.\nTherefore, the thermodynamic processes involved in this cycle (isothermal compression - isochoric\nwarming - isothermal expansion - isochoric cooling) are of interest to approximate the reversibility\nas much as possible. This is the key factor that distinguishes traveling-wave from standing-wave\nengines, as the latter relies instead on intrinsic irreversibility (Subsection 2.4.1). To enhance the\nheat transfer efficiency, the traveling wave systems require the porous material to have its average\npore radius very small compared to the thermal penetration depth (rs ? ??), so that to approach\nthe heat transfer process to an isothermal contact between the fluid particle and the pore internal\nwall. Besides, this porous material shall have an adequately higher thermal conductivity than that\nof a stack (applied in standing wave systems), to allow alternate heat storing and delivering during\nthe acoustic cycle, perfoming hence as a regenerator.\n\nMany engine configurations promoting the triggering of progressive wave are possible, and\nthe more conventional one uses a annular resonator (Fig. 2.4-(a,b)). In 1979, P. Ceperley was the\nfirst to propose this idea to demonstrate the possibility of developing thermoacoustic Stirling en-\ngines (Ceperley, 1979); he did not appreciate the second-order flow (Gedeon) that would render\nhis incarnations inoperable. Since then, this type of engine has been extensively studied (Ceperley,\n\n27\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Schematic representations of traveling-wave thermoacoustic engines. (a) Annular res-\nonator. (b) Annular resonator coupled to a secondary acoustic load (secondary resonator, electro-\ndynamic alternator, or any other load). (c) Co-axial resonator.\n\n1985; Yazaki et al., 1985). In 1999, Backhaus et al. were successful in developing a prototype of\nthermoacoustic Stirling engine wherein the feedback loop is coupled to a straight resonator (Back-\nhaus, 1999, 2000). A few years later, Backhaus et al. (2004) also developed a thermo-acoustic-\nelectric transducer prototype, wherein the acoustic-electric conversion is performed by a linear\nelectrodynamic alternator coupled to the annular resonator. Finally, Fig. 2.4-(c) shows a schematic\nversion of a co-axial (Bastyr, 2003) system in which the feedback loop is formed by placing a core\nin the thermoacoustic tube of largest section.\n\nTraveling-wave systems are here described analogously to the case of standing-wave, as pre-\nviously in Subsection 2.4.1. Neglecting the effects on the wave propagation due the waveguide\ncurvature, the annular thermoacoustic system shown in 2.4-(a) is also described by Eq. (2.52), ex-\ncept that the positions x = 0 and x = L correspond in reality to the same location, as they meet\neach other in a loop (Fig. 2.4-(a)). Hence, taking into account this continuity condition as below\n\n28\n\n\n\np?1(0) = p?1(L), (2.54)\n\nu?1,x(0) = u?1,x(L), (2.55)\n\nand making the substitution into Eq. (2.52), it results in the following:\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n= Tr \u00d7TTAC \u00d7Tl \u00d7\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n. (2.56)\n\nWhen a secondary element is coupled to the loop [cf. Fig. 2.4-(b)], the conservation of acous-\ntic pressures and volume velocity between x = 0 and x = L leads in this case to:\n\np?1(0) = p?1(L), (2.57)\n\nu?1,x(0) = u?1,x(L) ?Ychp?1(L), (2.58)\n\nwhere Ych is the acoustic admittance presented by the secondary load. This admittance can\nbe that of a closed tube, an electrodynamic alternator, or a combination of any acoustic element\ncharacterized by its reduced admittance. Relations (2.57) and (2.58) introduced in Eq. (2.56) then\nlead to:\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n= Tr \u00d7TTAC \u00d7Tl \u00d7\n\n(\n1 0\n\n?Ych 1\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n. (2.59)\n\nAt last, in the case of a co-axial system [cf. Fig. 2.4-(c)], Eq. (2.52) establishes the relation\nbetween acoustic pressure and volume velocity at the extremities of the tube of small section S.\nThe continuity relations expressed at x = 0, on the one hand,\n\n29\n\n\n\np?1(0) = p?a(0), (2.60)\n\nu?1,x(0) = Ygp?a(0) ? u?a,x(0), (2.61)\n\nand at x = L, on the other hand,\n\np?1(L) = p?a(L), (2.62)\n\nu?1,x(L) = Ydp?a(L) ? u?a,x(L), (2.63)\n\ninvolve the acoustic pressure p?a and the volume velocity u?a,x in the peripheral ring of section\nSA = ?(R\n\n?2 ?R2) and the admittances Yg and Yd of the large section tubes SL = SA + S and of\nrespective lengths lg and ld:\n\nYg,l = ?iZ(L)c cot(k\n(L)lg,d). (2.64)\n\nFrom Eqs. (2.60) to (2.63) and the transfer matrix of the peripheral ring denoted TA, a second\nmatrix equation relating the acoustic pressure and speed in x = 0 and x = L is then obtained as:\n\n(\np?1(0)\n\nu?1,x(0)\n\n)\n=\n\n(\n1 0\n\nYg ?1\n\n)\n\u00d7TA?1 \u00d7\n\n(\n1 0\n\nYd ?1\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n, (2.65)\n\nwhere the inverse matrix TA is introduced here to meet the x-axis and the conventions defined\nin Subsection 2.2.1. It should be noted that the matrix TA, when symmetrical and reciprocal, has\nits inverse well defined. Substituting Eq. (2.65) into Eq. (2.52) leads to the following equation:\n\n30\n\n\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n= Tr\u00d7TTAC\u00d7Tl\u00d7\n\n(\n1 0\n\nYg ?1\n\n)\n\u00d7TA?1\u00d7\n\n(\n1 0\n\nYd ?1\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n. (2.66)\n\nTo conclude, regardless of the kind of system involved in the equations (2.56), (2.59) or\n(2.66), there can be identified an expression of a transfer matrix that embraces TTAC and also\nconnects the complex amplitudes of acoustic pressure and volume velocity to the same position\nx = L by means of using the relation (2.52), thus completing a feedback loop. Equations (2.56),\n(2.59) and (2.66) may be written in the following general form:\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nMpp(?,T0(x)) Mpu(?,T0(x))\nMup(?,T0(x)) Muu(?,T0(x))\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?1(L)\n\nu?1,x(L)\n\n)\n, (2.67)\n\nequation admitting a non-trivial (non-zero) solution if and only if the determinant of the\nmatrix\n\n(\nMpp Mpu\nMup Muu\n\n)\n? I2 (2.68)\n\nis zero, where I2 is the identity matrix 2 \u00d7 2. That leads to the characteristic equation of the\nsystem:\n\n1 + MppMuu ?MpuMup ? (Mpp + Muu) = 0. (2.69)\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n3 EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE THERMOACOUS-\nTIC CORE\n\nEven below the threshold of thermoacoustic instability, the theoretical description of acoustic\npropagation and heat transfer through the thermoacoustic core (TAC) is anything but simple. This\nis essentially due to the fact that thermoacoustic engines make use of geometrically complicated\nmaterials (piles of stainless steel meshes, metallic foams) whose thermophysical parameters are\nunknown. Moreover, the accuracy of the description of acoustic propagation through the TAC also\ndepends critically on the shape of the temperature field within the TAC, the latter being very dif-\nficult to describe theoretically. Therefore, alternative methods allowing the description of the TAC\nare presented in this chapter. These methods consist of measuring the transfer matrix of the TAC,\nand the experimental data being used afterwards for the theoretical description of thermoacous-\ntic engines. Three different methods are presented in this chapter. First, the so-called \"two-load\nmethod\" previously used by Guedra et al. (2011) is presented and it is shown that this method\nbecomes inaccurate when the TAC is a regenerator-based one (Section 3.3). Then, two alternative\nexperimental approaches are presented: a two-load method with TAC inversion (Section 3.4) and\na new \"impedance\" method based on the measurement of the impedance matrix of the TAC by\nmeans of an acoustic impedance sensor (Section 3.6). In particular it is shown that the impedance\nmethod allows accurate descriptions of both stack-based TAC and regenerator-based TAC. Other-\nwise, it must be noted that, in essence, all three methods consist likewise in acoustic impedance\nmeasurements and require measurements under two different acoustic conditions. In spite of this,\nfor simplicity of identification, these three methods are here called as stated above.\n\n3.1 Description of the TAC under study\n\nAn approximate scale plan of the thermoacoustic core under study is presented in Fig. 3.1:\nits total length is 464 mm with an inner radius of 16.9 mm. The active part is made of a roughly\n70 mm long stack/regenerator (sometiles combined with ceramic washers) bounded by a hot heat\nexchanger (HHX) and an ambient heat exchanger (AHX), on opposite sides. The passive part is\nthe waveguide part set between the HHX and a secondary AHX. The geometrical properties of the\nsample materials used for the stack/regenerator in this study are reported in Tab. 3.1. With regards\nto the transversal dimensions, all are cylindrical and fit quite well the internal diameter of the stack\n\n33\n\n\n\nholder, which is around 33.9 mm. The two AHX are made up of two copper pipes passing through\na honeycombed aluminum disk, with flowing water inside the pipes at room temperature. The HHX\nis made up of a sample of ceramic catalyst 900 cpsi (cells per square inch) in which a Nichrome\nresistance wire is coiled. The thickness of this sample is 10 mm and the heat resistance wire is\nconnected to an electrical DC power supply controlling the heat power QH dissipated by Joule\neffect throughout the wire. In order to avoid electric contact between the Nichrome resistance of\nthe HHX and the stack/regenerator when made up of a conductive material, ceramic washers are\nplaced between them. These washers are also sculpted from pieces of ceramic catalyst of 900 cpsi\nmesh size. Their lengths are adjusted to better fit all pieces together in the stack holder. In the case\nof the Stainless Steel Grids, two washers are necessary, one at each material side, to stabilize the\ngrids assembling.\n\nFigure 3.1: Approximate scale plan of the ThermoAcoustic Core.\n\nIn the following, the objective is to measure each coefficient of the transfer matrix of the\nthermoacoustic core as a function of both angular frequency ? and heat power supply QH. The\ntransfer matrix TTAC (?,QH) is defined as\n\n(\np?r\n\nu?r\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nTpp Tpu\nTup Tuu\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?l\n\nu?l\n\n)\n\n= TTAC \u00d7\n\n(\np?l\n\nu?l\n\n)\n, (3.1)\n\n34\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: ThermoAcoustic Core.\n\nwhere p?l,r = p?(xl,r) and u?l,r = u?(xl,r) are the complex amplitudes of acoustic pressure p and\nacoustic volume velocity u at both ends x = xl (left) and x = xr (right) of the TAC (see Fig. 3.1).\nThe positions xl and xr are considered attached to the TAC no mattering whether it is inverted or\nnot with respect to its longitudinal axis.\n\n3.2 Common features\n\nThe three approaches considered in this chapter allow the measurement of the TTAC co-\nefficients as functions of both angular frequency ? and heat power supply QH: Tpp(?,QH),\nTpu(?,QH), Tup(?,QH) and Tuu(?,QH). In the following, whatever the method considered,\neach set of coefficient measurements covers the whole range of frequencies of interest for each\nspecific thermal condition QH, arbitrarily established. In the case of QH = 0, it is expected the\nTAC to be reciprocal, meaning that the determinant of its T-matrix equals 1. Therefore, the more\ndet(TTAC) approaches the unity, the better the measurements quality is. The reciprocity can be\nevaluated for each frequency, leading to the average value rc of reciprocity defined as\n\nrc =\n\n?\ni=1,...,N Tpp (?i, 0)Tuu (?i, 0) ?Tpu (?i, 0)Tup (?i, 0)\n\nN\n, (3.2)\n\n35\n\n\n\nCeramic Catalyst\nPorosity 83 %\nNumber of cells per square inch 600 cpsi\nLength 72.49 mm\n\nStainless Steel Grids\u2020\nPorosity 50 %\nWire mesh diameter 0.08 mm\nNumber of meshes per inch 93.36\nLength 60 mm + 2 ceramic washers (7 and 6mm)\n\nNichrome Foam\u2021\nSpecific surface area 2800 m2/m3\n\nAverage pore radius 0.6 mm\nLength 63 mm + ceramic washer (4mm)\n\nRVC Foam]\nPorosity 96.5 %\nNumber of pores per inch 100 ppi\nLength 68 mm + ceramic washer (3mm)\n\u2020 http://www.gantois.fr, product ref. 104696\n\u2021 http://www.recemat.nl, product ref. RCM.NCAX.2733\n] http://www.goodfellow.com\n\nTable 3.1: Geometrical properties of the sample materials.\n\n36\n\n\n\nwhere ?i is the ith value of the operating frequency, and N is the number of operating fre-\nquencies in the range of analysis. The standard deviation ?rc of rc is also evaluated. These statistical\nvalues are the quality parameters to be accomplished in this experimental investigation, taking as\nreferences their ideal values: 1 for rc, and 0 for ?rc. A discrepancy of rc from 1 means a devi-\nation of bias, typically related to an inhomogeneous temperature profile and/or to the sensitivity\nto a significant propagation of numerical errors in the course of the data post-processing. On the\nother hand, a discrepancy of ?rc from 0 is independent of the thermal profile and it is an indicator\nof noise, which may be caused by either an external interference or/and a significant numerical\nsensitivity, alike the bias case. By experience, an rc within 1 percent of the ideal unity and a ?rc\nwithin 0.01 suggest the quality of measurement is acceptable.\n\nHowever, when additional energy besides acoustical is inserted into the system, for example,\nthermal energy for, there is no longer unitary reciprocity. The more the temperature profile turns\ninhomogeneous with an increasing heat power input, the greater the gap between the resulted de-\nterminant and unity becomes. Hence, the reciprocity as a parameter of quality can only be usefully\nexploited if obtained from measurements with no heat supply, and, as much as possible, at a well\nestablished time-invariant and constant temperature profile along the TAC, so that the ideal unitary\ndeterminant can be pursued.\n\nIt is worth noting that the level of acoustic pressure in the TAC must be relatively small so\nas not to generate non-linear effects or thermoacoustically induced temperature gradient along the\nTAC.\n\nIn the following, it is assumed that the subsequent measurements with heating input can\nbe performed at the same level of quality for their corresponding TTAC coefficients than the one\nachieved without heating, even though there is no longer a clear reference such as reciprocity.\nThis assumption is grounded in the fact that, with or without heating supply, the whole setup and\nmeasurements are proceeded in the same way and standards for each approach. However, besides\nthose common procedures, heated measurements also require the establishment of a steady-state\nregime along all measurements - at least to a satisfactory level - to maintain the quality concerns.\nThus, the transitory thermal effects due to the imposed variations on QH, and also due to the\ncooling system interaction, are to be considered. They are investigated in Appendix A, and the\nresulting guidelines are followed in all measurements henceforth.\n\n37\n\n\n\nFramework solution for the two-port system\n\nThe experimental characterization of the TAC is based on the determination of the four coeffi-\ncients of the transfer matrix, for given ? and QH, from the measurement of p?l,r and u?l,r, according\nto Eq. (3.1). However, this measurement leads to a set of two equations with four unknown co-\nefficients, what compels another set of two to fulfill the deterministic system requirements. Such\nalgebraic constraints work either way for the other possible connecting matrices, namely diffusion,\nadmittance and impedance, as stated in the two-port theory. Therefore, those connecting matri-\nces are different ways to describe the same system, and they are interchangeable, thus allowing\nsearches for the transfer matrix from different approaches. Another theoretical aspect to be illumi-\nnated is that the need for two measurements vanishes if the system is symmetrical. However, this is\nnot the case for the TAC under investigation, as the porous material is located in a non-symmetrical\nposition with respect to the TAC axis (see Fig. 3.1); moreover, the HHX is another element also\nasymmetrically placed, what enhances this resolution.\n\nEssentially, one must proceed with two set of measurements to characterize a non-\nsymmetrical system, no matter what kind of connecting matrix is sought. Such conceptual state-\nments suggest that this need depends on the method or strategy to achieve TTAC. Consequently, all\nthree experimental approaches treated here end up within this frame.\n\n3.3 First approach: the Two-Load Method - about its failure\n\nThe \"Two-Load Method\" is the method previously used by Guedra et al. (2011) to evalu-\nate the experimental transfer matrix of a stack-based TAC. It consists of a classical experimental\nprocedure for the acoustic characterization where a four-microphone method is used to obtain the\nfour coefficients of the transfer matrix TTAC (?,QH) on a given frequency range and for various\nheating conditions (Boden, 1986; Munjal, 1987). The same experimental apparatus and most of the\nsetup procedures used by Guedra et al. (2011) are implemented in the frame of the present work.\nThe aim of this first approach is twofold: First, it is to check the repeatability of this measurement\ntechnique for a stack-based TAC. Second, it is to test the applicability of the Two-Load Method for\na regenerator-based TAC, exhibiting high acoustic reflectivity and low transmissibility.\n\n38\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Principle of the method\n\nA schematic view of the measurement system is given in Fig. 3.3. Two straight ducts are con-\nnected on either side of the TAC. The left tube is connected to an electrodynamic loudspeaker. Four\nmicrophones are set along the two waveguides at positions xi with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The TTAC coef-\nficients are obtained using Eq. (3.1). Thus, the principle of the method consists of calculating the\ncomplex amplitudes of p?l,r and u?l,r, from the pressure measurements at positions xi. However, it is\nclear that the relation of Eq. (3.1) is a system of two equations with four unknowns. Two measure-\nments are required to get the four transfer coefficients Tpp, Tpu, Tup and Tuu. A \"two-load\" method\nis then performed which consists of two measurements for two different terminal acoustic loads,\ncorresponding to two linearly independent states of the system: a first measurement is performed\nwith an open waveguide, then a second measurement is performed when the waveguide is closed\nby a rigid plug.\n\n1m\n\nLoudspeaker\n\nx1 x2 x3 x4xl xr\n\nThermoacoustic Core\n\nMic 1 Mic 2 Mic 3 Mic 4 Open or closed end\n\nRigid cover\n\nFigure 3.3: The four-microphone apparatus with the thermoacoustic core.\n\nUnder the assumption of an harmonic plane wave, the acoustic pressure in the waveguide can\nbe expressed in terms of the linear combination of two counterpropagating plane waves dependent\non the coordinate x,\n\np?(x) = p?+(x) + p??(x). (3.3)\n\nThe acoustic pressure can be written for two waveguide portions located at the left hand side\nof the TAC (x ? (0,xl)) and at the right hand side of the TAC (x ? (xr, l)),\n\np?(x) = p?+l e\njkw(x?xl) + p??l e\n\n?jkw(x?xl),?x ? [0,xl] (3.4)\n\n39\n\n\n\nand\n\np?(x) = p?+r e\njkw(x?xr) + p??r e\n\n?jkw(x?xr),?x ? [xr,L], (3.5)\n\nwhere the complex wavenumber kw takes into account the viscous and thermal losses on the\nwaveguide internal walls, as explained in Subsection 2.2.2.\n\nThe four counterpropagating acoustic pressure components stated in Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) can\nbe expressed in terms of the measured acoustic pressures p?i = p?(xi) taken at the four microphone\nlocations:\n\np?+l =\np?2e\n\njkw(xl?x1) ? p?1ejkw(xl?x2)\n\n2jsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, p??l =\n\np?1e\n?jkw(xl?x2) ? p?2e?jkw(xl?x1)\n\n2jsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.6)\n\np?+r =\np?4e\n?jkw(x3?xr) ? p?3e?jkw(x4?xr)\n\n2jsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, p??r =\n\np?3e\njkw(x4?xr) ? p?4ejkw(x3?xr)\n\n2jsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.7)\n\nfrom which the coefficients of the scattering matrix can be directly obtained when applying\nEq. (3.8):\n\n(\np?+r\n\np??l\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nT + R?\n\nR+ T?\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?+l\np??r\n\n)\n. (3.8)\n\nHowever, the scattering matrix itself does not directly achieve the interests of this work,\nwhich rely instead in the transfer matrix TTAC. Besides, even though the desired TTAC coefficients\ncould be obtained from the scattering matrix simply by applying the proper two-port transforming\nrelations, there is a more straightforward way to solve the problem, which is to apply Eq. (3.1).\n\nThe TTAC coefficients can be obtained from the determination of p?l,r and u?l,r by substituting\nthe four counterpropagating components obtained from Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7), respectively, into the\n\n40\n\n\n\ndefinition of Eq. (3.3) and into the Euler\u2019s equation (Eq. (3.9)) stated below:\n\nu?(x) =\nSw(1 ?f?)\n\nj??0\n\n?p?(x)\n\n?x\n=\n\n1\n\nZc\n[p?+(x) ? p??(x)], (3.9)\n\nwhere Zc is the characteristic complex impedance of the guide, defined by\n\nZc =\n?0c0\n\nS\n?\n\n(1 ?f?)(1 + (? ? 1)f?)\n. (3.10)\n\nThat finally gives\n\np?l,r = p?\n+\nl,r + p?\n\n?\nl,r, (3.11)\n\nu?l,r =\n1\n\nZc\n[p?+l,r ? p?\n\n?\nl,r]. (3.12)\n\nThe terms p?l,r and u?l,r are developed below by substituting the four expressions (3.6) and\n(3.7) into the definitions (3.11) and (3.12):\n\np?l =\np?2sin[kw(xl ?x1)] ? p?1sin[kw(xl ?x2)]\n\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.13)\n\np?r =\np?4sin[kw(xr ?x3)] ? p?3sin[kw(xr ?x4)]\n\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.14)\n\nu?l =\n1\n\njZc\n\np?2cos[kw(xl ?x1)] ? p?1cos[kw(xl ?x2)]\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n\n, (3.15)\n\nu?r =\n1\n\njZc\n\np?4cos[kw(x3 ?xr)] ? p?3cos[kw(x4 ?xr)]\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n\n. (3.16)\n\nWhen writing the transfer function H?ij between microphones i and j as\n\n41\n\n\n\nH?ij =\np?i\np?j\n, (3.17)\n\nEqs. (3.13), (3.14), (3.15) and (3.16) result in the following expressions:\n\np?l = p?1\nH?21sin[kw(xl ?x1)] ?sin[kw(xl ?x2)]\n\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.18)\n\np?r = p?3\nH?43sin[kw(xr ?x3)] ?sin[kw(xr ?x4)]\n\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.19)\n\nu?l = p?1\nH?21cos[kw(xl ?x1)] ? cos[kw(xl ?x2)]\n\njZcsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.20)\n\nu?r = p?3\nH?43cos[kw(x3 ?xr)] ? cos[kw(x4 ?xr)]\n\njZcsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.21)\n\nThese expressions fulfill the requirements to determine the four unknowns of the definition\nof Eq. (3.1) as long as p?l, p?r, u?l and u?r are measured twice, under two different acoustic loads (1st\nand 2nd), as explained above. That results in a deterministic system of four equations:\n\np?1str = Tpp.p?\n1st\nl + Tpu.u?\n\n1st\nl , (3.22)\n\nu?1str = Tup.p?\n1st\nl + Tuu.u?\n\n1st\nl , (3.23)\n\np?2ndr = Tpp.p?\n2nd\nl + Tpu.u?\n\n2nd\nl , (3.24)\n\nu?2ndr = Tup.p?\n2nd\nl + Tuu.u?\n\n2nd\nl . (3.25)\n\nSolving the system of equations above by substituting expressions from Eq. (3.18) to Eq.\n(3.21), the TTAC coefficients are found in terms of the measured transfer functions H?ij itemized\nin Eq. (3.17), which includes all measured acoustic pressures. The remaining terms related to the\nwavenumber kw and to the axial positions xi and xj are obtained independently from those mea-\nsurements. The resulting equations are shown in the following:\n\n42\n\n\n\nTpp =\nH?2nd31 (H?\n\n2nd\n43 .s3r ?s4r)(H?1st21 .cl1 ? cl2) ? H?1st31 (H?1st43 .s3r ?s4r)(H?2nd21 .cl1 ? cl2)\n\ns43(H?\n2nd\n21 ? H?1st21 )\n\n, (3.26)\n\nTpu = jZc\nH?1st31 (H?\n\n1st\n43 .s3r ?s4r)(H?2nd21 .sl1 ?sl2) ? H?2nd31 (H?2nd43 .s3r ?s4r)(H?1st21 .sl1 ?sl2)\n\ns43(H?\n2nd\n21 ? H?1st21 )\n\n, (3.27)\n\nTup =\n1\n\njZc\n\nH?1st31 (H?\n1st\n43 .c3r ? c4r)(H?2nd21 .cl1 ? cl2) ? H?2nd31 (H?2nd43 .c3r ? c4r)(H?1st21 .cl1 ? cl2)\n\ns43(H?\n2nd\n21 ? H?1st21 )\n\n, (3.28)\n\nTuu =\nH?2nd31 (H?\n\n2nd\n43 .c3r ? c4r)(H?1st21 .sl1 ?sl2) ? H?1st31 (H?1st43 .c3r ? c4r)(H?2nd21 .sl1 ?sl2)\n\ns43(H?\n2nd\n21 ? H?1st21 )\n\n, (3.29)\n\nwhere sij = sin[kw(xi ?xj)] and cij = cos[kw(xi ?xj)].\n\nIt is worth noting that the TTAC coefficients are acoustical properties that depend on fre-\nquency and temperature, and not on an imposed acoustic load. Hence, that allows such impositions\nto be arbitrarily defined to maximize the equations inter-independence, which increases the preci-\nsion of the TTAC coefficients determination. The acoustic loads are therefore chosen to differ each\nother as much as possible. Indeed, such independent conditions are evident in the denominators of\nall four coefficients, where the inequality H?2nd21 6= H?1st21 is to be ensured.\n\nThe complex notation in the frequency domain for the transfer functions is convenient, as\nhas been shown in this section so far. However, the original signal input, which are the actual\nmeasurements captured by the four microphones, are necessarily taken in the time domain and in\nreal values. Hence, a transformation takes place in this sense, in which these original signals have\ntheir amplitude ampi and phase phii of the ith microphone estimated by a numerical approach\napplied for each frequency ?, enabling the calculation of the complex transfer functions in the\nwhole frequency domain. Explicitly, that gives:\n\nH?21 =\namp2\namp1\n\ne?j(phi2?phi1),H?31 =\namp3\namp1\n\ne?j(phi3?phi1),H?43 =\namp4\namp3\n\ne?j(phi4?phi3). (3.30)\n\n43\n\n\n\nNevertheless, these original acoustic signals are too noisy to be put forward in the subse-\nquent calculations, and thus shall be conditioned for a proper refinement to avoid significant error\npropagation. This treatment is made by applying a least square method in a process of estimating\naverages ampi and phii, turning those signals closer to harmonic and less noisy.\n\n3.3.2 Experimental setup and procedures\n\nA photograph of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 3.4. The two tubes connected on either\nside of the TAC are made of PVC. They are two meters long and their inner radius R = 16.47 mm\nis slightly different than the TAC\u2019s one (Rw = 16.93 mm). The acoustic field is generated by an\nelectrodynamic loudspeaker attached to left extremity of the left duct, as shown in Fig. 3.3. It gen-\nerates a stepped sine corresponding to a frequency range from 50 to 200 Hz with increments of\n1 Hz. Hence, the measurements are carried out for 151 frequencies. An optimum acoustic pressure\nis achieved at its maximum linear behavior, which is at a pressure level around 0.4Pa, provided\nby a voltage of approximately 87mV delivered to the loudspeaker. Four microphones (model B&amp;K\n4138) are flush mounted along the pipes. They are placed in such locations that intrinsic measure-\nment errors are minimized, in conformity with the criteria established by Boden (1986):\n\n0.1? &lt;k0?x &lt;0.8?. (3.31)\n\nThat resulted in the interval ?x = 60 cm, what led the frequency range to fit within the\nproper interval between 50 and 200 Hz.\n\nTo ensure that no geometric discontinuity affects the sound field, the microphones are placed\nin suitable parts, machined so as to match the radius of curvature of the tubes, the junction between\nthe waveguides and the microphone membrane being made by a capillary tube. The measurement\nsignals are provided to the computer through the data acquisition card with a sampling frequency\nof 10 kHz, and their amplitude and phase are obtained using a least squares estimator from 500\nsamples taken for each frequency and at each microphone.\n\nA relative calibration of microphones is done in order to take into account their respective\nsensitivities. The microphones are placed face-to-face in a cavity of very small size relative to the\n\n44\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Experimental setup - Two-Load Method.\n\nwavelength, so that the pressure field can be considered spatially uniform in the working frequency\nrange (Fig. B.1). The transfer functions measured by this method are shown in Fig. B.2 These\ntransfer functions, denoted C?ij, defined as the ratios of sensitivities S of each microphone in the\nassumption of uniformity of pressure field,\n\nC?ij =\nSi\nSj\n, (3.32)\n\nare used as a correction for the transfer function measured in situ. More information concern-\ning the calibration procces is given in Appendix B.\n\nTo favor the stabilization of the temperature profile along the TAC axis, natural convection is\nminimized. That requires to keep the TAC always in the horizontal position, like in Fig. 3.1.\n\n45\n\n\n\nThe cooling system is totally prevented from air bubbles in the cooper pipes and water hoses\nwith the goal of improving the heat transfer efficiency, and also of avoiding the related noise -\nproved to be important. Within the same concern, vibration from the water pump and reservoir are\nminimized by means of keeping them apart from the TAC\u2019s workbench.\n\nClose temperature monitoring is recorded for every thermal condition, for all measurements.\nThese data are obtained by means of two thermocouples, one immersed in the water reservoir\nand the other attached to hottest external surface of the TAC. Moreover, a domestic thermome-\nter/hygrometer/barometer register the laboratory ambient conditions, which are recorded as well.\nThe average values are implemented in all post-processing to obtain the TTAC coefficients.\n\nAll setups are prepared the night before. The water circulation is turned on, and it is kept\noperating till the end of the experimentation for each material, according to the transient regime\ninvestigation. The TAC orientation is maintained in just one way, just like in Fig. 3.1. The transfer\nfunctions H?21, H?31 and H?43 are obtained for each one of the two acoustic loads, before changing the\nheating supply; that means to obtain the needed six transfer functions per QH condition. To define\nthe maximal QH, it is taken as reference the operational limit of the electrical resistance of the HHX\nhere used, which is around 84 W . For this power, the temperature inside the TAC rises over 400\u00baC -\nas explored later in Section 3.33 - which covers most of typical values for the threshold condition for\nstandard thermoacoustic engines. Therefore, such levels for QH are representative in what concerns\nreal engine circumstances. That said, the increment on the QH variation is defined constant, and\nits number is calculated so that all measurements can be done within one day (non-interrupted 13\nhours) for each material. This avoids major effects of ambient oscillations in temperature, humidity\nand pressure (less important). The interest is to have the number of power increments maximized\nas much as possible, to improve resolution with respect to performance predictions, to be explored\nlater on in Chapter 4. As a result, there are 28 different values for QH, ranging from 0 W to 81 W\nby a constant increment of 3 W .\n\nThe measurement procedures follow the logical sequence presented in Subsection 3.3.1. It\nbegins with QH = 0W , and then QH progresses by adjusting the power supply until QH = 81W ,\nalways in the increasing direction for both acoustic loads. For each QH the time-delay of 13 min is\nrespected.\n\n46\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Results\n\nTwo materials are investigated with the Two-Load Method: the Ceramic Catalyst (Fig. 3.5)\nand the pile of Stainless Steel Grids (Fig. 3.6).\n\nFigure 3.5: Ceramic Catalyst in detail and partially inserted in the open TAC.\n\nDespite of both cases having been done for 28 values of QH as mentioned in paragraph 3.3.2,\nresults are only shown for 3 heating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 36 W and Q = 72 W ) for the sake\nof clarity. This allows a visual evaluation of the curve progression with heating, if the noise level is\nnot excessively high. The choice of these two materials allows testing the Two-Load Method with\nboth stack-based and regenerator-based TAC.\n\nCase of the Ceramic Catalyst\n\nFigure 3.7 shows the four transfer coefficients (amplitude and phase) for the three selected\nheating conditions in the case of the Ceramic Catalyst. All curves are smooth and coherent with\nrespect to the QH variation.\n\nTo summarize the quality of this measurement, the Fig. 3.8 reveals the reciprocity behavior\nwith frequency (for QH = 0 W ). Its average value is around rc = 1.010 + 0.002i - hence very\n\n47\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Stainless Steel Grids, ceramic washers and stack/regenerator holder.\n\nclose to 1 - which indicates a low bias level. The reciprocity standard deviation, in its turn, is\n?rc = 0.002 + 0.002i. This is an indicator of low noise level, as it approaches 0.\n\nCase of the Stainless Steel Grids\n\nFigure 3.9 shows the four transfer coefficients (amplitude and phase) for the three heating\nconditions in the case of the Stainless Steel Grids. For this material, contrarily to the Ceramic\nCatalyst, all curves are very rough and do not allow a clear distinction of the QH progression. The\nreciprocity behavior in Fig. 3.8 shows that the problem comes from a very high noise level, since\n?rc = 0.134 + 0.123i. Bias, on the other hand, is not an issue in this case: rc = 0.996 + 0.005i.\nTherefore, as the method is the same one applied for the Ceramic Catalyst, under the same well-\ncontrolled experimental procedures, this high level of noise appears to be inherent in materials with\nlow porosity - which means high reflectivity. The average level of acoustic pressure is much higher\nin the duct placed upstream from the sample than in the duct at the downstream side; that causes\nthe microphones placed downstream to capture signals proportionally much more affected by noise\nthan the ones placed upstream, what ends up affecting the transfer coefficients as well.\n\n48\n\n\n\n0,05\n\n0,5\n\n1\n|T\n\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n1.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n0,4\n\n0.8  \n\n1.2\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n1.45\n\n1.6\n\n1.75\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n50 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 200\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n50 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 200\n\nFigure 3.7: Ceramic Catalyst 1: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC co-\nefficients in the frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 36 W(square) and QH =\n72 W(diamond) - Two-Load Method.\n\n3.3.4 Comparison with theory and analysis\n\nMaking use of the theory presented in Chapter 2, it is possible to derive the theoretical vari-\nation of TTAC coefficients with frequency for QH = 0 W . A comparison between theory and\nexperiment for the Ceramic Catalyst is given in Figs. 3.15 and 3.16. It shows a good agreement\nwith respect to all TTAC coefficients, despite the fact that the values of parameters given in Tab.3.1\nare not known with extreme accuracy. Those comparative results validate the experimental results,\nalthough restricted to the non-heated condition. In the case of heated conditions, the Two-Load\nMethod should be valid as well, since the same procedure has been followed along all measure-\nments, just as for QH = 0.\n\n49\n\n\n\n50 100 150 200\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n A\n\nm\np\n\nlit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n50 100 150 200\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n P\n\nh\na\n\nse\n (\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure 3.8: Amplitude and phase of the TTAC reciprocity in the frequency domain for QH = 0 W\nfor the Ceramic Catalyst 600 cpsi (bold lines) and the Stainless Steel Grids (thin lines)- Two-Load\nMethod.\n\nFor the 60 mm pile of Stainless Steel Grids, however, there are no geometrical parameters\naccurate enough to obtain ? and equivalent cylindrical rs because of its high tortuosity and com-\nplex geometry, and hence there are no theoretical TTAC coefficients available from the mentioned\nmodeling. In spite of that, ? and rs may estimated from the proper TTAC coefficients by applying an\ninverse method developed by Guedra (2012b) - as long as those coefficients are already obtained by\nother means, evidently. Then, using the measured TTAC by the Two-Load Method just presented,\nalthough noisy and imprecise (see Fig. 3.9), the estimation of ? and rs for the Stainless Steel Grids\nare still convergent, leading to ? = 63.3% and rs ? 0.04 mm. From then on, the theoretical mod-\neling can be applied to this material alike in the Ceramic Catalyst case, but the resulting TTAC\ncoefficients are no longer purely theoretical nor precise since its origins are unsatisfying experi-\nmental results. On the other hand, such experimental limitation concerns only noise level (?rc), and\nnot so much bias level (rc) - as shown in the previous subsection; that allows considering those ex-\nperimental results to be valid for the estimation of average parameters such as ? and rs, if there is a\nconvergence, as shown just above. This assumption gives a near reliability on the semi-theoretical\nTTAC coefficients, at least when using them as approximative reference for further experimental\ninvestigations.\n\n50\n\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n|T\n\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0 \n\n10\n\n40\n\n50\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n50 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 200\n0 \n\n10\n\n40\n\n50\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n50 100 150 200\n\n?2.8\n\n?2.5\n\n?2\n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n?0.8\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n50 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 20050 100 150 200\n\nFigure 3.9: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC co-\nefficients in the frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 36 W(square) and QH =\n72 W(diamond) - Two-Load Method.\n\n3.3.5 Discussion\n\nThe Two-Load Method is revalidated for a stack application taking a Ceramic Catalyst as the\ntested sample. However, it fails to accurately measure the TTAC coefficients for materials with low\nporosity, like a regenerator as the pile of Stainless Steel Grids. In principle, this kind of problem\ncould be accommodated by increasing the acoustic pressure level and the number of microphones.\nBut higher levels of acoustic pressure have been tested which did not lead to significant improve-\nments. Moreover, increasing the acoustic level magnitude leads to weakly nonlinear propagation, as\nwell as to significant thermoacoustic heat transport by sound along the material that might increase\nthe complexity of the experimental process. Then, another experimental approach is compelled to\nbe found. The following attempt is a variation of the Two-Load Method.\n\n51\n\n\n\n3.4 Second approach: the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion - about its failure\n\nThe Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion differs from the previous approach in just a single\naspect: the TAC orientation is inverted for one of the acoustic loads. The idea behind this attempt is\nto increase the independence between the two systems of two equations, as an additional contrast\nis imposed between the two set of measurements besides the difference on the two acoustic loads.\nThe higher such contrast is, the lower the expected sensitivities to transfer function variations are.\n\n3.4.1 Principle of the method\n\nIn essence, the same method as previous is once again applied, contextualized in the same\nblack box concept, just like in Section 3.3. That means that two sets of measurements involving\ntwo different acoustic loads are acquired. Nevertheless, the difference is that the TAC orientation is\ninverted for the first set of measurements (see Fig. 3.10), while the second set is kept as described\nin Subsection 3.3.2, referred to as the direct orientation. Order-of-inversion or opening/closing the\nTAC extremity is arbitrary.\n\nFigure 3.10: Sketch of the inverted ThermoAcoustic Core.\n\nThis inversion procedure must be accompanied by a proper adjustment in the corresponding\nanalytical expressions. The sole alteration in the equations is the inter-exchange of the positions\nxl and xr, since they are fixed to their original positions. Such exchange is therefore no longer\ncoherent to the in situ meaning of left and right orientation, from the experimentalist viewpoint.\n\n52\n\n\n\nFor the inverted TAC, the TTAC must be also inverted to maintain the same coefficients as in\nthe direct orientation:\n\n(\np?r\n\nu?r\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nTpp Tpu\nTup Tuu\n\n)?1\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?l\n\nu?l\n\n)\n. (3.33)\n\nArranging the definitions (3.1) and (3.33) for the two set of measurements, it results:\n\np?1str =\nTuu\n\nTppTuu ?TpuTup\n.p?1stl +\n\nTpu\nTpuTup ?TppTuu\n\n.u?1stl , (3.34)\n\nu?1str =\nTup\n\nTpuTup ?TppTuu\n.p?1stl +\n\nTpp\nTppTuu ?TpuTup\n\n.u?1stl , (3.35)\n\np?2ndr = Tpp.p?\n2nd\nl + Tpu.u?\n\n2nd\nl , (3.36)\n\nu?2ndr = Tup.p?\n2nd\nl + Tuu.u?\n\n2nd\nl , (3.37)\n\nwith p?l,r and u?l,r being expressed analogously to the previous Eqs. (3.13) to (3.16), shown\nin the first approach (Section 3.3). In this set of equations, Eq. (3.34) and (3.35) differ from Eq.\n(3.22) and (3.23) due to the TAC inversion of the first measurement. As a consequence, a proper\nadjustment concerning such difference results in eight specific equations to be taken into account:\n\np?1stl =\np?1st4 sin[kw(xl ?x3)] ? p?1st3 sin[kw(xl ?x4)]\n\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.38)\n\np?2ndl =\np?2nd2 sin[kw(xl ?x1)] ? p?2nd1 sin[kw(xl ?x2)]\n\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.39)\n\np?1str =\np?1st2 sin[kw(xr ?x1)] ? p?1st1 sin[kw(xr ?x2)]\n\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n, (3.40)\n\np?2ndr =\np?2nd4 sin[kw(xr ?x3)] ? p?2nd3 sin[kw(xr ?x4)]\n\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n, (3.41)\n\nu?1stl =\n1\n\njZc\n\np?1st4 cos[kw(x3 ?xl)] ? p?1st3 cos[kw(x4 ?xl)]\nsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]\n\n, (3.42)\n\n53\n\n\n\nu?2ndl =\n1\n\njZc\n\np?2nd2 cos[kw(xl ?x1)] ? p?2nd1 cos[kw(xl ?x2)]\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n\n, (3.43)\n\nu?1str =\n1\n\njZc\n\np?1st2 cos[kw(xr ?x1)] ? p?1st1 cos[kw(xr ?x2)]\nsin[kw(x2 ?x1)]\n\n.

For these experiments, no heating power is supplied to the HHX\n(QH = 0 W ). This simple configuration allows the estimation of the reciprocity. It is then pos-\nsible to evaluate if this method is suitable using further measurements for various heat power levels.\n\n54\n\n\n\nThe Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion requires special care relying on the successive\nconnection and disconnection between the TAC and the waveguides, to proceed with the change on\nthe TAC orientation before every new set of measurements. All joints are cleaned, re-greased, and\nwell adjusted to avoid as much as possible length variations caused by clearances.\n\n3.4.3 Results for the Stainless Steel Grids\n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude of the TTAC coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion (bold lines), Two-Load Method (thin lines)\nand Theory (dashed lines).\n\nThe experimental TTAC coefficients of the Stainless Steel Grids are presented in Figs. 3.11\nand 3.13, while the reciprocity spectrum is shown in both amplitude and phase in Fig. 3.14.

Moreover, a particular resonance frequency is clearly\nrevealed at 134 Hz either on the amplitudes or phases, which is not obtained with the previous\nmethod. Concerning the reciprocity statistical parameters, on the other hand, the Two-Load Method\nwith TAC Inversion leads to an average value rc = 0.243?1.727i with a standard deviation ?rc =\n3.787 + 4.238i, which indicates very poor performance not only for bias level but also for noise\nlevel, as ?rc is so far from 0.

Arbitrary noise and\nbias are then inserted into the theoretical transfer functions H? obtained from the modeling given\nin Chapter 2. Two kinds of material are tested: the Ceramic Catalyst and the Stainless Steel Grids.\nThese materials are described by their respective geometrical parameters which are the average\npore radius rs, the porosity ? and the length ` (see Table 3.1). In the case of the Stainless Steel\nGrids, the estimated porosity (?) and the estimated representative average cylindrical pore radius\n(rs) are obtained from the very noisy TTAC coefficients previously measured with the Two-Load\nMethod without TAC inversion, using a specific method developed by Guedra (2012b).\n\n58\n\n\n\nThe noise is theoretically taken into account by adding a random amplitude AnFr and a ran-\ndom phase PnFr to the amplitude and phase of the theoretical transfer function H?, where An and\nPn are arbitrary amplitude and phase of the noise level, respectively, and where Fr is a random\nfunction whose values are uniformly distributed in an interval constrained between ?1 and 1.The\nchoice of a uniform distribution is found to be better than a Gaussian one since it avoids unreal-\nistic values, which may be present whenever the aleatory numerical generation is not constrained.\nThe noisy transfer function is then calculated as below for each frequency i individually, with the\nrandom function F ir being required accordingly,\n\nH?inoise = |H?\ni|(1 + AnF ir)e\n\nj(?(H?i)+PnF\ni\nr), (3.50)\n\nConcerning the bias, the same disturbance is uniformly applied to the whole spectra. The\nbiased transfer function is then obtained as below,\n\nH?bias = |H?|(1 + Ab)ej(?(H?)+Pb), (3.51)\n\nwhere Ab and Pb are the respective amplitude and phase of the bias level. Both Ab and Pb are\neither added or subtracted, thus developing four combinations of bias.\n\nThe following values are used along the entire sensitivity analysis: An = 0.1, Pn = 0.03?\nrad, Ab = 0.1 and Pb = 0.03? rad. They are chosen compromisingly to comparative intents, as\npreviously.\n\nThe four curves corresponding to the four combinations of bias are plotted as solid curves\nin all graphs of sensitivity analysis. Concerning the noise presentation, however, five curves are\nplotted per graph with the intent of a clear illustration. They differ by their aleatory nature and are\npresented as dotted lines. These graphic results are shown in the next eight figures, where both two-\nload methods can be compared for the Ceramic Catalyst and for the Stainless Steel Grids. Figs. 3.15\nand 3.16 give the amplitudes and phases of TTAC coefficients when estimated with classical Two-\nLoad Method, while Figs. 3.17 and 3.18 are the corresponding results for the Two-Load Method\nwith TAC Inversion. Likewise, Figs. 3.19 to 3.22 treat the Stainless Steel grids case.\n\n59\n\n\n\nFrom Figs. 3.15 to 3.18, it is clear that the Two-Load Method overcomes the Two-Load\nMethod with TAC Inversion when applied to a stack-like material. Either amplitude or phase of both\nnoise and bias achieve a very symmetrical behavior with respect to the theory, and they also enclose\nquite well the experimental curves, which on its turn fits closely along the theoretical curves.\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15: Ceramic Catalyst: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed) with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load\nMethod.\n\nIn the case of the pile of Stainless Steel Grids, as shown in Figs. 3.19 and 3.20, the exper-\nimental results obtained with the two-load method without inversion, despite of being poor, are\ncloser to the theoretical curves than the bias and the noise ones. That suggests a quality of mea-\nsurements good enough to minimize the effects of both sensitivities; however, as the sensitivity to\nnoise is specially high, the experimental curves still result noisy, even though much less than the\ntheoretical noise curves. In principle, that could be just a matter of setting up other values for An\nand Pn, but those parameters are chosen the same for all cases, as mentioned before, to standardize\nall comparisons.\n\n60\n\n\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16: Ceramic Catalyst: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for QH =\n0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed) with the respective theoretical\nbias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method.\n\nFigs. 3.21 and 3.22 reveal a high sensitivity to bias of the Two-Load Method with TAC\nInversion, which is in accordance with the reciprocity results. A highlighted resonance peak at\naround 134 Hz appears in both experimental and biased curves. However, despite already having\ninput high levels for Ab and Pb, the experimental peak is still much higher than the biased one (by\na factor of 10). That incites for seeing how coherent the curves are for the previous approach, i.e.\nthe two-load method without inversion. About the noisy curves, they are closer to the theoretical\nreference than the biased ones, as predicted in the reciprocity results. Furthermore, they reveal\na little higher sensitivity in the region between 50 Hz to 70 Hz, what is indeed shown in the\nexperimental curves.\n\n61\n\n\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17: Ceramic Catalyst: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the theory (dashed) with the respective theoretical bias (four thin solid\nlines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion.\n\nThis scenario implies to distrust the biased experimental curves from the Two-Load Method\nwith TAC Inversion not only because of their evident low quality, but also because of a possible\nerror intrinsic to the experimental procedures, since such intense effect does not occur for the\nTwo-Load Method without inversion. One plausible explanation for that is supported by a critical\nexperimental contrast between those methods. The second approach is much more risky than the\nfirst one since it requires the actual physical inversion of the TAC, what certainly adds errors\nin the measurements by the unavoidable variations on positioning. If this issue is solved by a\nmore precise coupling in the TAC connections, the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion could\npotentially be better than the Two-Load Method, as its sensitivity is much smaller to noise along\nthe whole spectra of analysis. That may be advantageous enough to overcome the higher sensitivity\nto bias, since this one is restricted to a much smaller frequency interval.\n\n62\n\n\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18: Ceramic Catalyst: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for QH =\n0 W in bold lines for the theory (dashed) with the respective theoretical bias (four thin solid lines\nper graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion.\n\nIn conclusion, the Two-Load Method is indeed much more sensitive to noise than the Two-\nLoad Method with TAC Inversion for this kind of material, i.e. a regenerator. Regarding the bias\ncurves, both methods show similar behavior, in the same level of disturbance.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility would be to use a two-source method instead of a two-load\nmethod. The two-source method basically consists of using an anechoic termination as a load, and\nproceeding with two measurements with TAC inversion. However, we did not choose to investigate\nthe method, notably because it might have the same drawbacks as the two former methods, which\nare intrinsic to multiple microphones methods.\n\n63\n\n\n\n10\n?2\n\n10\n?1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n10\n?1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n10\n\n?2\n\n10\n?1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n10\n\n?1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain\nfor QH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load\nMethod.\n\nAt this point, the search for a third approach is justified since the regenerator-based TAC\nis not plentifully modeled nor characterized, by far. The Impedance Method is presented in the\nfollowing Section 3.6.\n\n3.6 Third approach: the Impedance Method\n\nAiming to solve the problem of characterizing the TAC filled with a material exhibiting a low\nporosity, as the Stainless Steel Grids, an alternative method is here developed.\n\n64\n\n\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nA\n\nrg\n(T\n\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20: Stainless Steel Grids: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load\nMethod.\n\nThe Impedance Method consists of obtaining the TTAC coefficients from the measurement of\nthe impedance matrix ZTAC (Bannwart et al., 2012, 2013). All measurements are made by means\nof a specific device called the Acoustic Impedance Sensor (AIS) (Le Roux, 2012) - shown in Figs.\n3.23 and 3.26 - coupled to the TAC under test (Figs. 3.24 and C.1). This alternative method is more\ndirect than either previous approaches since there is no need to account for plane wave propagation\nin some ducts surrounding the TAC, and there are no limitations in the frequency range of analysis\nrelative to the distance between microphones (Boden, 1986).\n\n65\n\n\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.21: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain\nfor QH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load\nMethod with TAC Inversion.\n\n3.6.1 Principle of the method\n\nThe impedance matrix of the TAC is defined as(\np?l\n\np?r\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nZ11 Z12\nZ21 Z22\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\nu?l\n\nu?r\n\n)\n\n= ZTAC \u00d7\n\n(\nu?l\n\nu?r\n\n)\n, (3.52)\n\nwhich is in accordance with Fig. 3.1.\n\n66\n\n\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.22: Stainless Steel Grids: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load\nMethod with TAC Inversion.\n\nThe TTAC coefficients, defined in Eq. (3.1), are calculated from the two-port equations that\nrelate them to the ZTAC coefficients, as below:\n\nTpp =\nZ22\nZ12\n\n, (3.53)\n\nTpu =\nZ12Z21 ?Z22Z11\n\nZ12\n, (3.54)\n\nTup =\n1\n\nZ12\n, (3.55)\n\nTuu =\n?Z11\nZ12\n\n. (3.56)\n\n67\n\n\n\nFigure 3.23: Front and back views of the AIS, and the AIS with the Adaptive Part.\n\nThe ZTAC coefficients are obtained from two sets of measurements, since the TAC is asym-\nmetrical (see Framework solution for the two-port system, in Section 3.2). That means that Eq.\n(3.52) provides two equations and four unknowns, and thus it requires two different setup arrange-\nments to fulfill the 2 \u00d7 2 deterministic system, just as in the previous approaches. Unlike those\napproaches, however, the Impedance Method does not require two different acoustic loads; instead,\nthe only difference between the first and the second measurement is the TAC orientation, which is\ninverted for the second measurement.\n\nIn the first measurement, the AIS is attached to the left side of the TAC, which is referred to\nas the position xl aside of the porous material (see Figs. 3.24). In the second measurement, the AIS\nis placed at the opposite side, referred to as the right position xr.\n\nFor the first measurement one have:\n\n(\np?1stl\np?1str\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nZ11 Z12\nZ21 Z22\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\nu?1stl\nu?1str\n\n)\n.

The AIS\nitself consists of a piezoelectric buzzer loaded by a small cavity on its rear face and radiating to-\nwards a short duct on its front face, as shown in detail in Fig. 3.26. Two microphones (labeled Mic.1\nand Mic. 2) are flush-mounted along the wall at both sides of the piezoelectric buzzer. The front\ncavity of the impedance sensor is coupled to one end of the TAC under test. The other end of the\nTAC is closed by a rigid wall. Mic.1 measures the pressure p1(t) inside the rear cavity, while Mic.2\nmeasures the pressure p2(t) in the front duct. A third microphone (labeled Mic.3), flush-mounted\nin the center of the closing rigid wall, measures the pressure p3(t) at the end of the TAC. At low\nfrequencies, below the first resonance of the rear cavity, the pressure is uniform in the cavity and\np1(t) is proportional to the volume velocity u(t) produced by the buzzer. Then, from the measure-\nment of pressures p1(t) and p2(t), and taking into account the acoustic propagation along the front\nduct, the first measurement configuration (AIS coupled to the left side of the TAC) leads to the\ncalculation of pressure p?l and volume velocity u?l at the reference plane located at x = xl, while the\nsecond configuration (AIS coupled to the right side of the TAC) leads to the calculation of pressure\np?r and velocity u?r at the reference plane, this time located at x = xr. Those measurements lead to\nthe estimation of the input acoustic impedances Z1stinp (or Z11) and Z2ndinp (or Z22), according to Eqs.\n3.58 and 3.62 respectively. The transfer impedances Z1stT (or Z21) and Z\n\n2nd\nT (or Z12) are obtained\n\nfrom measurements of p3(t) = p(xr, t) and p3(t) = p(xl, t) respectively, in accordance Eqs. 3.59\nand 3.61.\n\nIn order to not be restricted to very low frequencies and gain precision, more refined\nimpedance expressions account for the microphone positions relative to the reference plane, the\nmicrophone sensitivity differences, and all geometrical dimensions concerning the AIS ducts (see\nFig. 3.26). The Z-matrix coefficients Zinp and ZT for both first and second set of measurements\nare generally expressed as follows, as if there were no need for an Adaptive Part to connect the\nTAC (see Fig. 3.24), nor any relevant waveguide discontinuity. These equations (Macaluso, 2011;\nLe Roux, 2012) take as reference plane the position just at the exit of the AIS, with Lap = 0. To\ndistinguish those generalized impedances from the actual impedances with a real Adaptive Part\n(Lap > 0), they are here assigned as Z\n\n?\ninp and Z\n\n?\nT .\n\n71\n\n\n\nFigure 3.26: Sketch of the Acoustic Impedance Sensor and the Adaptive Part.\n\nZ\n?\n\ninp =\n(H?21/K) ??\n1 ?

The terms ? and ? are developed from cylindrical waveguide solu-\ntions, while K and KT are related to the calibration of the device (Macaluso, 2011; Le Roux, 2012).\n\n72\n\n\n\nTheir corresponding expressions are given in the below:\n\n? = jZc2 tan(kL\n\u201d\n2), (3.67)\n\n? = j tan(kL2)/Zc2, (3.68)\n\nK = ?j\n1\n\nZc1\n\ns?2\ns?1\n\nsin(kL1) cos(kL\n\u201d\n2)\n\ncos(kL\u201d1) cos(kL2)\n, (3.69)\n\nKT = ?\nZc2\nZc1\n\ns?3\ns?1\n\nsin(kL1)\n\nsin(kL2) cos(kL\n\u201d\n1)\n, (3.70)\n\nwhere the dimensions L1, L2, L\u201d1 and L\n\u201d\n2 provide the cavities lengths and microphones posi-\n\ntions, according to Fig. 3.26; the characteristic impedances Zc1 =\n?c\n\nS1\nand Zc2 =\n\n?c\n\nS2\ncorrespond to\n\nthe back and front cavities, with their respective cross sections S1 = ?d21/4 and S2 = ?d\n2\n2/4 ; the\n\nwavenumber k = 2?f/c does not account for losses in such small environments, with frequency f\nin Hz and speed of sound c ? 344 m/s at 22 \u00baC; and the sensitivities s?1, s?2 and s?3 correspond to\nthe three microphones.\n\nThe calibration process is, at first, to remove the TAC and close the acoustic impedance\nsensor by the rigid plate that supports the microphone 3 (see Fig. mic3). The transfer functions H?21\nand H?31 are then measured and here labeled with the subscript \u201ccal\u201d. As a consequence of such\na configuration, the impedance at the reference plane is the same as the transfer impedance to the\nmicrophone 3 due to the fact that the position is coincident. Assuming 1/Z11,cal = 1/Z21,cal ? 0\nleads to K = ?H?21,cal and KT = H?31,cal (Macaluso, 2011). Therefore, as a final result of the\ncalibration, the parameters K and KT are obtained from the measurements of H?21,cal and H?31,cal,\nand both ratios of sensitivity s?2/s?1 and s?3/s?1 are implicitly taken into account. The substitution of\nK and KT into Eqs. (3.64) and (3.65) gives\n\n73\n\n\n\nZ\n?\n\ninp =\n1\n\n?\n\n(H?21/H?21,cal) ? ??\n1 ?

(3.72)\n\nConsideration of the waveguide discontinuity\n\nThe AIS used in this work delivers the acoustic excitation to the TAC under an important\ngeometrical discontinuity. That comes from the sudden diameter variation between the AIS exit\nand the Adaptive Part, which is from 16 mm to 33.9 mm in an angle of 90 degrees (see Figs. 3.26\nand 3.24). The resulting effect is an additional impedance that is here taken into account to improve\nthe measurements accuracy. This impedance is labeled Zdis, and it is subtracted from the first hand\nmeasured input impedances by the AIS, so that to obtain the corrected ZTAC coefficients, which,\nfor instance, do not account for the Adaptive Part yet.\n\nZdis is calculated according to the following algorithm (Kergomard, 1987):\n\n\u2022 Rmin is the minimal value between r2/rap and rap/r2, where r2 is the AIS front cavity\nradius and rap is the Adaptive Part radius;\n\n\u2022 If Rmin 6 0.55\n\nthen kcor = 0.82(1 ? 1.35Rmin + 0.31R3min), with kcor being the corrected wavenumber;\n\n? else kcor =\n4\n\n?\nR2min1[0.5035 ? 0.492log(Rmin1) ? 0.376R2min1 ? 0.852R2min1log(Rmin1)],\n\nwhere Rmin1 = 1 ?Rmin;\n\n\u2022 If r2 6 rap\n\nthen lcor = kcorrap/Rmin, where lcor is the equivalent length;\n\n74\n\n\n\n? else lcor = kcorrap;\n\n\u2022 Concluding, Zdis results in\n\nZdis =\njk0lcor\nSap?c\n\n, (3.73)\n\nwhere k0 is the wavenumber without losses, Sap = ?r2ap, and ? is the average gas density.\n\nApplying Zdis into Eqs. (3.71) and (3.72),\n\nZ\n?\n\ninp,dis =\n1\n\n?\n\n(H?21/H?21,cal) ? ??\n1 ? (H?21/H?21,cal)\n\n?Zdis, (3.74)\n\nZ\n?\n\nT,dis =\nH?31\n\n(\n1 + ?Z?inp,dis\n\n)\n?H?31,cal\n\n. (3.75)\n\nNevertheless, an Adaptive Part must be provided to connect the AIS to the specific system\nunder analysis, which is the TAC in this study. The Adaptive Part is specifically designed for that,\nand consists in a short waveguide section of 22 mm length and same diameter as the TAC ends.\nTherefore, its acoustical effects are not negligible, reminding that the TAC length is only 460 mm.\n\nConsideration of the Adaptive Part\n\nIn order to take into account the length of the Adaptive Part, which is Lap = 22mm, the\nreference plane is established in between this part and the TAC, as shown in Figs. 3.23, 3.24 and\n3.26. That requires changing the reference plane from the AIS exit to the TAC input, which may be\nat the position xr or xl, depending on whether the TAC is inverted or not, respectively.

(3.81)\n\nFinally, the substitution of the ZTAC coefficients into Eqs. (3.53) to (3.56) leads to the deter-\nmination of TTAC.\n\n3.6.2 Sensitivity analysis for the Impedance Method\n\nBefore starting with the actual measurements, a sensitivity analysis for the Impedance\nMethod is put forward. That way, if not promising, this third attempt would be dismissed and\nanother solution would be researched. Just like the previous approaches, the same procedures are\nhere applied, except that, instead of adding noise and bias into the theoretical transfer functions,\nthose disturbances are inserted into the theoretical impedances. Thus, Eqs. (3.50) and (3.51) turn\ninto the equivalent ones below:\n\nZinoise = |Z\ni|(1 + AnF ir)e\n\nj(?(Zi)+PnFir), (3.82)\n\nZbias = |Z|(1 + Ab)ej(?(Z)+Pb), (3.83)\n\nwith An, Ab, Pn and Pb being setup at the same levels as for the previous two approaches.\n\nThe results are explored in the next four figures from 3.27 to 3.30, handling the Stainless Steel\nGrids and the Ceramic Catalyst as well. The frequency range chosen for this sensitivity analysis\nis the same as for the previous approaches, from 50 to 200 Hz, despite of the fact that the actually\nmeasured frequency range is much wider, from 30 to 500 Hz. That way, performance comparisons\ncan be made under uniform basis.\n\n77\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.27: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain\nfor QH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Impedance\nMethod.\n\nFigures 3.27 and 3.28 present a smaller sensitivity to noise and bias for the Stainless Steel\nGrids in comparison with the previous two-load approaches. That encourages to proceed with ac-\ntual measurements, which are beforehand presented in these figures by practical purposes, as a\nmatter of fact. The experimental curves behave in good agreement to the semi-theoretical ones,\nand they are also coherently within the sensitivity constraints. Indeed, the reciprocity parameters\nrc = 1.004 + 0.009i and ?rc = 0.008 + 0.007i contribute to verify such agreement. Therefore, at\nleast for a regenerator-like material so far, the Impedance Method is surely proved to be perform-\ning. To continue with this method evaluation, a stack-like material - namely the Ceramic Catalyst -\nis investigated in the following.\n\n78\n\n\n\n?3\n\n?2.5\n\n?2\n\n?1.5\n\n?1\nA\n\nrg\n(T\n\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n3.2\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n\n?2.2\n\n?2\n\n?1.8\n\n?1.6\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28: Stainless Steel Grids: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Impedance\nMethod.\n\nFinally, as the conclusive part of the sensitivity analysis, Figs. 3.29 and 3.30 reveal that the\nImpedance Method is also promising for stack-like materials. The sensitivity predictions for noise\nand bias are even better than for the Two-Load Method, as it may be clearly seen. To support this,\nthe experimental curves for the Ceramic Catalyst (beforehand presented) behave in good agreement\nwith the purely theoretical ones. For this material, are recorded the best reciprocity parameters\nwithin the 50 to 200 Hz range in this investigation: rc = 1.002 ? 0.001i and ?rc = 0.001 + 0.002i\n(see Table 3.2).\n\nTo conclude the sensitivity analysis for the Impedance Method and also embracing Section\n3.5, the Impedance Method is the best method among the three methods tested, as it is the least\n\n79\n\n\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29: Ceramic Catalyst: amplitude of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for\nQH = 0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective\ntheoretical bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Impedance\nMethod.\n\nsensitive to noise and bias, and as it covers both stack-like and regenerator-like materials. Relying\non these results, the Impedance Method is used for subsequent works. In particular, other materials\ncan be tested as stack/regenerator, such as NiCr Foam and RVC Foam.\n\n3.6.3 Experimental setup and procedures\n\nThe experimental procedure for the measurement of the impedance matrix ZTAC is described\nbelow. Each sample is heated by means of a heat power supply QH increasing from 0 up to 81 W\nby steps of 9 W . The measurements are made for each heat condition for the first configuration\n\n80\n\n\n\n?3\n\n?2.5\n\n?2\n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\nA\n\nrg\n(T\n\np\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?3\n\n?2.5\n\n?2\n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n)(\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.30: Ceramic Catalyst: phase of the four T coefficients in the frequency domain for QH =\n0 W in bold lines for the measurements (solid) and theory (dashed), with the respective theoretical\nbias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Impedance Method.\n\n(AIS coupled to the left side of the TAC, see Fig. 3.24, \u201cMeasurement 1\u201d). Afterwards, the heat\npower supply is turned off. The TAC is then naturally cooled and it reaches the ambient tem-\nperature homogeneously after a few hours. Subsequently, the impedance sensor is inverted (see\nFig. 3.24, \u201cMeasurement 2\u201d) and the same sequence of measurements is applied, following the\nsame rising heat supplies and keeping the same time intervals between them, in order to obtain\na thermal field inside the TAC as similar as possible to the one obtained in the previous set of\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, this procedure may be sensitive to ambient temperature variations,\nor even pressure variations, as the total duration of both sequences of measurements takes several\nhours. But proceeding this way leads to the best results. As with the previous approaches, all tran-\nsient thermal guidelines stated in Appendix A are here respected as well. As explained before, the\nacoustic impedance sensor allows measurements in a much wider frequency range than the Two-\n\n81\n\n\n\nLoad Method does. Hence, it is chosen to investigate the problem within the interval between 30\nto 500 Hz, by steps of 1 Hz. This allows investigation of a wide range of operating frequencies\nfor different engines configurations. Those results are displayed in the following (Subsection 3.6.4)\nand in also Appendix D.\n\n3.6.4 Results\n\nIn this section, results are given for TAC made of a pile of Stainless Steel Grids, a Ceramic\nCatalyst, a NiCr Foam (Fig. 3.31) and a RVC Foam (Fig. 3.32). Table 3.2 reports rc and ?rc\nfor all four materials in two frequency ranges: from 50 to 200 Hz, for comparisons with results\nof the previous approaches (also included), and from 30 to 500 Hz, which is the range actually\nhere covered by the Impedance Method. That way, a clear overview of performances of all three\napproaches is provided. Columns 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the respective three approaches and refer\nto the narrower frequency range; they consist of results already discussed in the sensitivity analysis\n(see Section 3.5 and Subsection 3.6.2). The last column, on the other hand, concerns the Impedance\nMethod for the wider frequency range. The Impedance Method provides the best results in all cases,\nno matter the material kind or frequency range. When comparing third and fourth columns, one can\nrealize a slight decrease in performance for the wider frequency range - particularly for the ?rc\nvalues - that indicates some additional noise effects. Indeed, such effects are predictable since the\nwider frequency range reaches a lower limit, 30 Hz; this additional interval from 30 to 49 Hz is\nmore susceptible to external influences like the noise from the water pump, for example. However,\nthose ?rc values are still low and the reciprocity is considered verified either way.\n\n82\n\n\n\nTwo-Load Two-Load (Inv.)

Only three\nheating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 36 W and Q = 72 W ) are shown in this section, for the sake of\nclarity, just like for the results of the first approach. However, the RVC Foam requires lowering the\nupper limit of heat input, to avoid its spontaneous combustion, as the whole experimentation is in\nthe presence of atmospheric air. That ended up in lower heating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 9 W\nand QH = 18 W ), according to a specific investigation that led to this finding: measuring the\nsteady state temperature just aside of the HHX, by means of a thermocouple (Fig. 3.33), the tem-\nperature reached ? 230\u00b0C for QH = 15 W , and ? 262\u00b0C for QH = 18 W ; hence, a next step of\n\n83\n\n\n\nQH = 21 W would have been risky since the temperature limit for the RVC Foam integrity in the\npresence of oxygen is around 300\u00b0C.\n\nFigure 3.32: Reticulated Vitreous Carbon (RVC) Foam and the open TAC.\n\nFigure 3.33: Temperature measurements at the right side of the HHX by means of a 35 cm long\nthermocouple accessing it from the TAC right side; the RVC Foam is within the TAC.\n\n84\n\n\n\nCase of the pile of Stainless Steel Grids\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n40\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0 \n\n10\n\n20\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\nA\n\nrg\n(T\n\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n30\n|T\n\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\nFigure 3.34: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC\ncoefficients in the frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 36 W(square) and QH =\n72 W(diamond) - Impedance Method.\n\n85\n\n\n\nCase of the Ceramic Catalyst\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0.1\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?1.8\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.9\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n|T\n\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\nFigure 3.35: Ceramic Catalyst: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC co-\nefficients in the frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 36 W(square) and QH =\n72 W(diamond) - Impedance Method.\n\n86\n\n\n\nCase of the NiCr Foam\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0,15\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?1.9\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.9\nA\n\nrg\n(T\n\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n|T\n\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\nFigure 3.36: Nichrome Foam: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC coefficients\nin the frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 36 W(square) and QH = 72 W(diamond)\n- Impedance Method.\n\n87\n\n\n\nCase of the RVC Foam\n\n0,15\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n|T\np\np\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0,2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n5\n\n|T\np\nu\n|/\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\np\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0,15\n\n0.5 \n\n1\n\n|T\nu\np\n|.\nZ\n\nc\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\np\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\n0,4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n|T\nu\nu\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?3.5\n\n?2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\nA\nrg\n\n(T\nu\nu\n) \n\n(r\na\n\nd\n)\n\nFigure 3.37: RVC Foam: amplitude (solid line) and phase (dotted line) of the TTAC coefficients in\nthe frequency domain for QH = 0 W(circle), QH = 9 W(square) and QH = 18 W(diamond) -\nImpedance Method.\n\n3.6.5 Discussion and comparative analysis with the previous approaches\n\nAll curves for QH = 0 W presented in Figs. 3.34, 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37 behave coherently\nwith their corresponding reciprocity parameters, which are presented in Table 3.2. The fact that\n- for all materials - rc is close to unity and ?rc is very low gives consistency to the Impedance\n\n88\n\n\n\nMethod. Either bias or noise level is low, hence. Such consistency leads to assume that the same\nquality is achieved for the heated measurements as well, since the same experimental procedures\nare undertaken, and besides, to consider the thermal effects due to the condition QH > 0, the\ntransient constraints achieved in Appendix A are here respected as much as for the first approach.\n\nAn interesting aspect to note is that ?rc for the Stainless Steel Grids behaves differently than\nfor the other three materials. In fact, it is much bigger, although still small enough to not turn\nthose measurements noisy. That means the TTAC coefficients of the Stainless Steel Grids have a\nhigher noise level than those of the other materials. Indeed, when visually comparing the curves\nof Figs. 3.34, 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37, the Stainless Steel Grids case is clearly the most noisy among\nall four materials, seeming to follow ?rc proportionally. This behavior is also in agreement with\nthe theoretical curves of sensitivity analysis, shown in Figs. 3.27, 3.28, 3.29 and 3.30, where the\nsensitivity to noise is revealed higher for the Stainless Steel Grids than for the Ceramic Catalyst.\n\nAnother way to compare those results is to display amplitude and phase of the reciprocity\nspectrum for the four materials (Fig. 3.38). They behave accordingly both to the comparison above\nand to the Table 3.2, where the Stainless Steel Grids results are more noisy than the ones for the\nother materials. However, when comparing those results with the ones obtained by the Two-Load\nMethod (Fig. 3.39) - also for the Stainless Steel Grids - it gets clear once more how advantageous\nthe Impedance Method is. Not only in qualitative aspects, but also because of its easier way to\ncover a wider frequency range, as is does not depend on fitting waveguide lengths nor microphones\npositioning to cover specific frequency ranges of interest.\n\nIn the case of the Ceramic Catalyst, amplitude and phase of reciprocity are displayed in\nFig. 3.40 for both Impedance Method and Two-Load Method. Both also behave coherently to the\nsensitivity analysis and Table 3.2. Similar low noise levels are achieved, whereas the Two-Load\nMethod results are a little more biased for both amplitude and phase, besides the fact that they\nreach a narrower frequency range.\n\n89\n\n\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n1.04\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n A\n\nm\np\n\nlit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n?0.06\n\n?0.04\n\n?0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n P\n\nh\na\n\nse\n (\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure 3.38: Amplitude and phase of the TTAC reciprocity in the frequency domain for QH =\n0 W for the Stainless Steel Grids (relatively noisy lines), Ceramic Catalyst (continuous thin lines),\nNichrome Foam (dotted lines) and RVC Foam (dashed lines) - Impedance Method.\n\n90\n\n\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nR\n\ne\nci\n\np\nro\n\nci\nty\n\n A\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n P\n\nh\na\n\nse\n (\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure 3.39: Stainless Steel Grids: amplitude and phase of the TTAC reciprocity in the frequency\ndomain for QH = 0 W for the Impedance Method and for the Two-Load Method (very noisy lines).\n\n91\n\n\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n0.98\n\n0.99\n\n1\n\n1.01\n\n1.02\n\n1.03\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n A\n\nm\np\n\nlit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n30 100 200 300 400 500\n?0.02\n\n?0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nR\ne\n\nci\np\n\nro\nci\n\nty\n P\n\nh\na\n\nse\n (\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure 3.40: Ceramic Catalyst: amplitude and phase of the TTAC reciprocity in the frequency do-\nmain for QH = 0 W for the Impedance Method and for the Two-Load Method (lines of narrower\nfrequency range).\n\n3.7 Conclusion\n\nThe Two-Load Method, either with or without the inversion of the TAC, is not capable of\ncharacterization of low porosity materials such as the here tested stacked steel grids - at least for\nthe length of this case-study, which is significantly longer than typical ones used in thermoacoustic\nsystems.\n\n92\n\n\n\nIn both cases, a high level of sensitivity to noise (first case) and to bias (second case) is\nverified experimentally and also confirmed by a numerical simulation. Such accordance between\nthese approaches validates one each other, in fact.\n\nThus, an alternative method based on the impedance matrix measurement has been de-\nveloped, which leads to the T-matrix coefficients of the TAC. This method, called \"Impedance\nMethod\", lead to good results for both stack and regenerator. The low average value of reciprocity\nand the corresponding standard deviation for QW = 0 is an indicator of the measurement quality.\n\nThis method has been used to characterize different materials which can be anticipated to\nbehave as \"stack\" or \"regenerator\" (respective Ceramic Catalyst and Stainless Steel Grids), or in\nbetween \"stack\" and \"regenerator\" (NiCr Foam and RVC Foam).\n\nThe knowledge of the T-matrix coefficients of the TAC at different heating conditions can\nnow be used to determine both the operating frequency fop and the intrinsic thermoacoustic ampli-\nfication gain G in a thermoacoustic engine. This application of the Impedance Method is discussed\nin the next chapter.\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n4 APLICATION TO THE DESIGN OF THERMOACOUSTIC ENGINES\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nAn experimental method allowing the measurement of the T-matrix coefficients of a TAC at\ndifferent heating conditions has been presented in the previous chapter. The knowledge of these\ncoefficients can be used to predict both the heat power supply and the operating frequency which\ncorrespond to the onset of self-sustained acoustic waves in a thermoacoustic engine equipped with\nthe TAC characterized beforehand, as done by Guedra et al. (2011). It is however worth mention-\ning that such a task requires having made the T-matrix measurements for numerous values of heat\npower supply QH, since the accuracy of the predictions of onset is directly related to the step of\nheat supply ?Q between two set of measurements. An alternative but similar approach consists in\ndeveloping an adequate modeling which would predict both the operating frequency fop. and the\nintrinsic thermoacoustic amplification gain G associated both to a given heat power QH supplied\nto the TAC and to the respective geometry of each element surrounding this TAC. This chapter\npresents a general modeling method (Bannwart et al., 2013) based on this alternative approach,\nwhich allows calculation of both the operating frequency fop. and the thermoacoustic gain G in a\nthermoacoustic engine from the measured T-matrix components of a given TAC under a given heat\npower supply QH; this approach also leads hence to the determination of the onset of self-sustained\noscillations, whose accuracy depends on the step of heat supply ?Q as well. An optimization of the\ngeometric parameters of each element surrounding the TAC can be then performed by searching\nthe geometrical configuration leading to a maximum value of the gain G. Thereby, this modeling\nmethod allows comparison of the potential performances of the different sample materials charac-\nterized in Section 3.6, taking G as the main comparative parameter. This method is applied in the\nfollowing to the optimization of the performances of a simple standing-wave and a simple closed-\nloop engine (see Fig. 4.1), but it is also easily applicable to a more complicated engine such as the\none of Fig. 1.1. Aiming to achieve the best results possible in this work, all experimental data used\nin this chapter are the ones obtained from the Impedance Method.\n\n95\n\n\n\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n????????????????????????\n\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????\n\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n??????????????????\n\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n???????????????????????\n???????????????????????\n???????????????????????\n???????????????????????\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??????\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n??????\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n???\n???\n???\n???\n\n?\n?\n?\n?

The second one is made of a closed-loop, containing the TAC,\nconnected to a straight duct. It is worth noting that in the configuration of the closed-loop engine,\nit is assumed that the curvature of the waveguide, and especially that of the TAC, has no impact on\nthe propagation of acoustic waves.\n\n4.2.1 Standing-wave engine\n\nFirst, the standing wave engine of Fig. 4.1 is taken into consideration. Two straight ducts of\nlengths L1 and L2 are connected to the TAC. These ducts have the same inner diameter than the\nTAC. Assuming the propagation of plane acoustic waves at angular frequency ?, it is possible to\nrelate the acoustic pressure p?L and volume velocity u?L at position x = L to the pressure p?0 and\n\n96\n\n\n\nvolume velocity u?0 at position x = 0 as follows:\n\n(\np?L\n\nu?L\n\n)\n= T2 \u00d7TTAC \u00d7T1 \u00d7\n\n(\np?0\n\nu?0\n\n)\n= Ttot \u00d7\n\n(\np?0\n\nu?0\n\n)\n, (4.1)\n\nwhere the T-matrices\n\nTj(j=1,2) =\n\n(\ncos(kLj) iZc sin(kLj)\ni\nZc\n\nsin(kLj) cos(kLj)\n\n)\n(4.2)\n\ncharacterize the lossy propagation of acoustic waves in the ducts of respective lengths L1 and L2\nand where\n\nk =\n?\n\nc0\n\n(\n1 +\n\nf? + (? ? 1)f?\n1 ?f?\n\n)1/2\n(4.3)\n\nand\nZc =\n\n?0c0\n\nS [(1 ?f?)(1 + (? ? 1)f?)]\n1/2\n\n(4.4)\n\nare the complex wavenumber and the characteristic impedance of the ducts, respectively. In\nEqs. (4.3) and (4.4), ?0 is the fluid density at room temperature, c0 is the adiabatic sound speed,\n? is the specific heat ratio of the fluid, S is the duct cross-sectional area, and the functions f? and\nf? characterize the thermal and viscous coupling between the oscillating fluid and the duct walls\n(Swift, 2002; Arnott et al., 1991). Then, taking into account that u?L = 0 (rigid termination), one\ngets (\n\np?0\n\nu?0\n\n)\n= T?1tot \u00d7\n\n(\np?L\n\n0\n\n)\n=\n\n(\nApp Apu\n\nAup Auu\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?L\n\n0\n\n)\n, (4.5)\n\nfrom which one can write the reflected acoustic impedance at position x = 0:\n\nZ0 =\np?0\nu?0\n\n=\nApp\nAup\n\n. (4.6)\n\nThe knowledge of this reflected acoustic impedance Z0 = Z0(L1,L2,QH,?) can be used\nto determine the resonance frequencies of the complete device. In particular, if the left side of the\nengine is also terminated by a rigid plug (infinite impedance), then the principle of impedance\nmatching tells that the resonance frequencies correspond to the maxima of |Z0| (these maxima\nshould tend towards infinity if losses were neglected). As an illustrative example, the modulus of\nZ0 and its real part are presented for three levels of heat supply in Fig. 4.2 as a function of the\n\n97\n\n\n\nfrequency in the particular case when L1 and L2 are fixed to 160 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The\nreflected impedance Z0 is calculated using the experimental transfer matrix TTAC of the ceramic\nstack previously determined under different levels of heat power supply.\n\n65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n2\n0\n\nlo\ng\n\n1\n0\n|Z\n\ne\nn\n\nt|\n\n65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nx 10\n\n7\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n?\n(Z\n\ne\nn\n\nt)\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n.m\n\n?\n3\n)\n\nFigure 4.2: Ceramic Catalyst: modulus and real part of the reflected acoustic impedance for QH =\n9W (dash-dotted line), QH = 18 W (dashed line), and QH = 27 W (solid line).\n\nFrom the analysis of |Z0|, it appears that the first resonance frequency fop. of the system\nis around 80 Hz, and that it tends to increase with heating. Moreover, the quality factor of the\nresonance (which is inversely proportional to the width of the resonance peak) increases as QH\nincreases from 9 to 18 W . This is consistent with our expectations since the quality factor should\ntend towards infinity as the system approaches the threshold of thermoacoustic instability (Atchley\net al., 1992). However, the width of the resonance peak increases as QH increases from 18 to\n27 W , which seems surprising at first sight. Actually, this means that the system is above threshold\nfor QH = 27 W so that the width of the resonance peak is no longer related to the quality factor\nof the resonance: this quality factor should become negative through onset (Atchley, 1994a), for\n\n98\n\n\n\nwhich the net attenuation of sound becomes negative. Additional insight arises from the analysis\nof&lt;(Z0) at resonant frequency fop., leading to the same conclusions: if QH ? 18 W , the real part\nof Z0(fop.) is positive which means that work is absorbed by the device, but for QH = 27 W the\nreal part of Z0 becomes negative which means that work is produced by the system (Hatori et al.,\n2012). In other words, if QH = 27 W the system is above threshold, and self-sustained acoustic\nwaves should oscillate at frequency fop. (in as much as it is considered that the generation of large\namplitude acoustic oscillations does not induce variations of the temperature field inside the TAC\nwith subsequent variations of its transfer matrix).\n\nGain G Operating freq. fop.\nQH = 9 W ?0.14 79.7 Hz\nQH = 18 W 0.91 81.1 Hz\nQH = 27 W 1.50 82.1 Hz\nQH = 36 W 1.82 83.2 Hz\n\nTable 4.1: Performances for a standing-wave engine equipped with a stack (Ceramic Catalyst)\n(L1 = 160 cm and L2 = 10 cm).\n\nOnce the reflected impedance Z0 is determined, the resonance frequencies of the device are\nknown. It is then possible to choose a particular working frequency and to calculate a thermoa-\ncoustic amplification gain associated to the acoustic mode under consideration. Let\u2019s assume that\nthe operating angular frequency ?op. is fixed to that of the first acoustic mode (which is gener-\nally the most unstable mode). Assuming as well that the acoustic pressure p?0 at position x = 0 is\nfixed to some arbitrary value P0, from which one easily gets the corresponding volume velocity\nu?0 = P0/Z0, together with the acoustic pressures and volume velocities at positions xl, xr and L\n(which are deduced from u?0, p?0 and the T-matrices T1, TTAC, and T2). Therefore, it is possible to\ncalculate the acoustic power\n\nWloss =\n\n[\n1\n\n2\n<(p?lu??l ) ?\n\n1\n\n2\n<(p?0u??0)\n\n]\n+\n\n[\n1\n\n2\n<(p?Lu??L) ?\n\n1\n\n2\n<(p?ru??r)\n\n]\n(4.7)\n\ndissipated by viscous and thermal losses into the ducts, where ? denotes the conjugate of a complex\nnumber, and to calculate the acoustic power\n\nWTAC =\n\n[\n1\n\n2\n<(p?ru??r) ?\n\n1\n\n2\n<(p?lu??l )\n\n]\n(4.8)\n\n99\n\n\n\nproduced within the TAC. The powers Wloss and WTAC depend on the unknown parameter P0, but\ntheir ratio does not. Then, a thermoacoustic amplification gain G can be defined as follows:\n\nG =\nWTAC\n|Wloss|\n\n. (4.9)\n\nThis parameter G has the meaning of an energy balance in the system: if G > 1, then the\nacoustic work produced by thermoacoustic effect in the TAC is higher than the losses in the re-\nmaining of the device, so that the extra work can be provided to an acoustic load.\n\nThe results obtained for the frequency of operation fop. and the corresponding thermoacoustic\namplification gain G are reported in Tab. 4.1: the engine under consideration is a standing wave\nengine equipped with a ceramic catalyst stack, while L1 and L2 are fixed to 160 cm and 10 cm,\nrespectively. The calculations of G are consistent with the conclusion mentioned above that the\nheat supply corresponding to onset threshold (G = 1) is between 18 and 27 W .\n\n4.2.2 Closed-loop engine\n\nThe same kind of analysis as the one presented above can be used in the case of a closed-loop\nengine (see Fig. 4.1) which is the basic geometrical configuration encountered in thermoacoustic\nStirling engines that use a regenerator instead of a stack. As in Subsection 4.2.1, the first step\nconsists in determining the reflected impedance Z0 from the T-matrices T1,2 and TTAC. After a\nfew calculations, one gets\n\nZ0 =\nBppZ2 + Bpu\nBupZ2 + Buu\n\n, (4.10)\n\nwith\n\n(\nBpp Bpu\nBup Buu\n\n)\n= T?12 , (4.11)\n\n100\n\n\n\nZ2 =\np?2\nu?2\n\n=\nCpu\n\n(1 ?Cuu)(1 ?Cpp) ?CpuCup\n, (4.12)\n\nand (\nCpp Cpu\nCup Cuu\n\n)\n= TTC \u00d7T1. (4.13)\n\nTherefore, assuming that p?0 = P0 at position x = 0, one gets u?0 = P0/Z0, and\n\n(\np?2\n\nu?2\n\n)\n= T2 \u00d7\n\n(\np?0\n\nu?0\n\n)\n, (4.14)\n\n(\np?1\n\nu?1\n\n)\n=\n\n(\n1 0\n\n0\n1?Cpp\nCpu\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n(\np?2\n\nu?2\n\n)\n, (4.15)\n\n(\np?l\n\nu?l\n\n)\n= T1 \u00d7\n\n(\np?1\n\nu?1\n\n)\n, (4.16)\n\n(\np?r\n\nu?r\n\n)\n= TTAC \u00d7\n\n(\np?l\n\nu?l\n\n)\n. (4.17)\n\nFrom these relations, one obtain the acoustic work produced within the TAC (Eq. (4.8)) and\nthe acoustic work\n\nWloss =\n\n[\n1\n\n2\n<(p?2u??2) ?\n\n1\n\n2\n<(p?0u??0)\n\n]\n+\n\n[\n1\n\n2\n<(p?lu??l ) ?\n\n1\n\n2\n<(p?1u??1)\n\n]\n(4.18)\n\nconsumed in the remaining of the device, which fulfills the expression for the thermoacoustic\namplification gain G = WTAC/|Wloss|, as described in Eq. 4.9.\n\n101\n\n\n\n4.3 Calculation of G and fop. from experimental data\n\nAs soon as the experimental transfer matrix of a given thermoacoustic core is measured for\nvarious heating conditions, an optimization of the thermoacoustic amplification gain can be done\nthanks to the theory given in the previous section. This optimization is achieved for a given heat\npower supply by searching the geometry of the thermoacoustic device which leads to a maximum\nvalue for G. In our case study, this amounts to determining the optimal lengths L1 and L2 within\ntheir respective arbitrary ranges, which are for instance bounded by the frequency limits, i.e. from\n30 to 500 Hz in our measurements. However, for illustration purposes, it is chosen to show G and\nfop. for a narrower interval, from 30 to 250 Hz, as the optimal G is still embraced in all cases. This\noptimization is done for each one of the four thermoacoustic cores made of different materials.\nNevertheless, before presenting these results, a comparison is put forward regarding a theoretical\ntransfer matrix in Subsection 4.3.1. In this comparison, it is also shown the advantage of post-\ntreating the experimental data with least squares regression to a polynomial.\n\n4.3.1 Comparison between results from theoretical and experimental data\n\nThe validity of the measured TTAC by the Impedance Method for both stack-like and\nregenerator-like porous material has been already proved in Chapter 3. However, in order to il-\nlustrate and reverify the accuracy of those experimental data and, reciprocally, the accuracy of the\ntheoretical model for stack-like materials, a comparison between results beyond just the TTAC co-\nefficients is here put forward. G and fop. are calculated from data of both origins and compared.\nThe Ceramic Catalyst is the chosen material for that since its geometrical simplicity allows to have\na reliable theoretical modeling for its non-heated TTAC, as discussed in Chapter 2. Therefore, the\nexperimental data are for non-heated TTAC as well. As the Ceramic Catalyst is a stack, the most\nappropriate engine for this study is the standing-wave kind, which is shown in Fig. 4.1.\n\nFigure 4.3 shows the theoretical fop. for the first resonance mode as function of the variable\nlengths 0.6 m ? L1 ? 4 m and 0 m ? L2 ? 0.4 m. These intervals are chosen according to\nthe need for a good graphical resolution for the experimental results, which are displayed in the\nfollowing of these theoretical ones. The number of points per interval are, respectively, 60 and 40,\nwhat gives a total of 2400 combinations of engines per analysis. The corresponding G is shown in\nFig. 4.4. As these surfaces are calculated from theoretical data, they are smooth.\n\n102\n\n\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nL\n2\n (m)L1 (m)\n\nf o\np\n\n. (\nH\n\nz)\n\nFigure 4.3: Theoretical fop. for standing-wave engines at QH = 0 W for the Ceramic Catalyst.\n\nThe corresponding fop. and G from experimental data are very close - but evidently not iden-\ntical - to previous, as one would expected. For the sake of simplicity, however, only the G surface\nis here presented (Fig. 4.5). When comparing Figs. 4.4 and 4.5, it is visible some small level of\nnoise in the measured G, which is intrinsic to experimental data and coherent to the results of the\nsensitivity analysis of Subsection 3.6.2, and to the reciprocity parameters of Tables 3.2 and 4.2.\nOne interesting aspect to note, however, is the non-negligible difference in the optimal G between\nboth the cases. As expected by theory, the maximal G for QH = 0W results negative (?0.383), as\nthere is no thermoacoustic production when the temperature gradient along the TAC is zero. That\nis why this maximal G can reach values close to zero, but still negative. On the other hand, the\nmaximal G from experimental data results positive (0.166). This is due to irregularities in the G\nsurface. Nevertheless, such roughness can be minimized by applying a least squares regression to\na polynomial into the measured transfer functions from which the TTAC coefficients are calculated.\nThe polynomial regression with the best results in this investigation is of fifth degree, which leads to\nbetter and smoother surfaces such as of Fig. 4.6. This polynomial regression (or curve fitting), when\napplied to the theoretical case does not lead to significant changes, what is interesting with respect\nto the data quality preservation. Hence, that contributes to the reliability of the already significant\nimprovement in the experimental case (see Table 4.2). Therefore, the polynomial regression of fifth\ndegree is adopted as regular procedure to all following calculations of optimal G or fop..\n\n103\n\n\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nL\n2\n (m)L1 (m)\n\nG\na\n\nin\n\nFigure 4.4: Theoretical Gain for standing-\nwave engines at QH = 0 W for the Ceramic\nCatalyst.\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nL\n2\n (m)L1 (m)\n\nG\na\n\nin\n\nFigure 4.5: Gain for standing-wave engines at\nQH = 0 W from measured TTAC of the Ce-\nramic Catalyst by the Impedance Method.\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nL\n2\n (m)L1 (m)\n\nG\na\n\nin\n\nFigure 4.6: Gain for standing-wave engines at QH = 0 W from measured TTAC of the Ceramic\nCatalyst using polynomial regression of fifth degree - Impedance Method.\n\n104\n\n\n\nTheory Fitted Theory Experiment Fitted Experiment\n\nG ?0.386 ?0.383 0.166 0.001\nfop.(Hz) 38 37.7 42 38.2\n\nL1(m) 4 4 3.60 4\n\nL2(m) 0 0 0 0\n\nrc 1.000 + 0.000i 1.000 + 0.000i 1.003 + 0.000i 1.002 ? 0.001i\n?rc 0.000 + 0.000i 0.000 + 0.000i 0.003 + 0.003i 0.000 + 0.001i\n\nTable 4.2: Maximal performances and respective configurations for standing-wave engines at QH =\n0 W calculated from theoretical and experimental data, fitted or not with polynomial regression of\nfifth degree, with their corresponding average reciprocities and average standard deviations in the\nfrequency range from 30 to 500 Hz.\n\n4.3.2 Standing-wave engines for QH > 0\n\nFor the standing-wave configuration, optimization results are given in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8 for\nthe case of the Ceramic Catalyst with the maximum value of heat supply QH = 81 W . Figure\n4.7 shows the evolution of the operating frequency fop., and Fig. 4.8 shows the corresponding\nthermoacoustic amplification gain G as a function of the variable lengths 0.6 m ? L1 ? 4 m\nand 0 m ? L2 ? 0.4 m. For each configuration (in terms of L1 and L2), the operating frequency\nfop. is searched around the first resonance mode (although higher order modes might become\nmore unstable for some values of the lengths L1 and L2). To ensure this search, an approximate\nprediction of the resonant frequency is estimated taking into account the sound speed evolution\nwith the increase in the heating supply QH, so that the range of frequency around the resonance\ncan be better adjusted; this procedure is repeated for of each thermal condition. In the case\nof QH = 81W , a peak value of G = 3.31 is reached with L1 = 1.06 m and L2 = 0 m, at\nfop. = 121 Hz. It is worth mentioning that the obtained value for the \u201coptimum\u201d length L2\nequals 0, which is equivalent to closing the right side of the TAC by a rigid plug: this result\nsuggests that the length of the Thermal Buffer Tube of the TAC under test is too long (in the\nsense that if a shorter TBT had been used, a non-zero optimal length L2 might have been expected).\n\n105\n\n\n\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nL\n2\n (m)L1 (m)\n\nf o\np\n. (\n\nH\nz)\n\nFigure 4.7: fop. for standing-wave engines at QH = 81 W from measured TTAC of the Ceramic\nCatalyst using polynomial regression of fifth degree - Impedance Method.\n\nThe same analysis is done for the other three materials, and results are summarized in Table\n4.3. None of them reaches the thermoacoustic outbreak, as their optimal gain are below the unity. In\nthe case of the Nichrome Foam, the maximum G is not so smaller than 1, which is consistent with\nthis material geometrical properties (see Tab. 3.1), closer to the ones of the Ceramic Catalyst; one\nmay expect to reach the onset when slightly increasing QH. In the case of the RVC Foam, the results\nare less promising than the Ceramic Catalyst\u2019s case. However, it is worth noting that the maximum\nheat supply for the RVC Foam is only 18 W due to its temperature limitation in the presence of\noxygen (combustion hazard): such a material should be possibly employed as a stack if an inert\ngas were chosen as the working fluid. At last, as what would be expected, the pile of stainless\nsteel grids is the worst material of all for the standing-wave engine; it has the lowest porosity and\nsmaller average pore radius, which are undesirable aspects for a standing-wave system. These four\nmaterials have best performance with L2 = 0. For both RVC Foam and Stainless Steel Grids the\nfop. results not much higher than 30 Hz, with L1 at the upper limit of the established constraints,\nwhat leads to a less well defined G peak for these general conditions and frequency range.\n\n106\n\n\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n?14\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\n4\n\nL\n2\n (m)L\n\n1\n (m)\n\nG\na\n\nin\n\nFigure 4.8: Gain for standing-wave engines at QH = 81 W from measured TTAC of the Ceramic\nCatalyst using polynomial regression of fifth degree - Impedance Method.\n\n4.3.3 Closed-loop engines for QH > 0\n\nThe same kind of comparative analysis is conducted for the closed-loop configuration. The\nresults are summarized in Table 4.4. For this configuration, the pile of Stainless Steel Grids is\nexpected to have the best result. Nevertheless, despite of its favorable properties mentioned before,\nsuch material appears in the last performance position. However, when noting the typical lengths\nof alike materials usually employed as regenerators, which are around few centimeters, it becomes\nsuggestive to consider our 6 cm pile as too long. Indeed, this conclusion would be in agreement\nwith the strong decay of acoustic pressure level along its axis, as verified during our measurements\nof its TTAC. Hence, besides low porosity and small average pore radius, this pile also exhibits a\nlength too large, which contributes proportionally to the viscous losses.\n\nActually, the best performing material here tested is the Nichrome Foam, whose maximum\ngain reaches 6.88 at 35.2 Hz, with L1 = 0.90 m and L2 = 3.80 m, as illustrated in Figs. 4.9 and\n4.10 (note that a contour plot is preferred to a surface area in Fig. 4.11, which shows more clearly\nthe optimum values of L1 and L2).

The maximum gain G is 1.47 with a corresponding frequency\nfop. = 156 Hz. In that specific case, the process of optimization leads to an engine which is different\nfrom the one obtained with the NiCr Foam.

Their performances\nhave been evaluated either by sensitivity analysis or by actual measurements involving different\nporous materials inside this thermoacoustic core. Close agreement has been found between both\nperspectives, and these three approaches have been extensively analyzed and compared. The third\napproach, here called Impedance Method, has been proved to be accurate due to its intrinsic low\nsensitivity to noise and bias, and such accuracy could be verified because of the precision of the\nacoustic impedance sensor, to the care taken in its calibration, and to the close monitoring over\nthe variation of the temperature distribution. It has been shown that this method, contrarily to the\nTwo-Load Method or the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion, is accomplishing independently\non the material under test, even if dealing with one that resembles a lengthy regenerator.\n\nThe T-matrix components of the TAC have been measured for different kinds of materials\nunder different heating conditions, and these data have been used to calculate the associated oper-\nating frequency and thermoacoustic amplification gain in both a simple standing-wave engine and\na simple closed-loop engine. An optimization process of the engine\u2019s operation has been proposed,\nwhich consists of maximizing the thermoacoustic amplification gain, and the results obtained also\ngive the opportunity to compare the performances of different materials. The optimization method\npresented in Sec. 4.3 could be applied to more complicated engines as the one depicted in Fig.\n1.1, with many more parameters to adjust (notably the electromechanical parameters of the linear\nalternator). However, in what concerns the engine performance evaluation, the works presented in\nthis thesis also reveal important features to be improved later on, in future experiments, aiming at\nmore reliable results.\n\nThe low predicted performance for the closed-loop engine with the Stainless Steel Grids in-\ndicates that this sample may be too long (at least if it shall be used as a regenerator) so that it is\ndifficult to apply a steep temperature gradient along it in order to reach a substantial thermoacoustic\namplification, as it would be expected for such material; besides, the proportional viscous dissipa-\ntion also contributes in this sense. These results are in accordance with the difficulties encountered\nduring the transfer matrix measurements by the Two-Load method due to the strong acoustic pres-\nsure decay. These difficulties, for instance, have led to the development of the alternative method to\n\n113\n\n\n\novercome them. The alternative method has been proved to be capable to evaluate a regenerator for\na wide range of lengths (till at least 60 mm) with enough accuracy to allow an engine performance\nprediction. The performance prediction also allows the evaluation of the outreach limits of the TBT\nlength. In the case of the Ceramic Catalyst for the standing-wave engine, for example, the TBT\nlength seems too high, as it is suggested that one would find a better performance for a shorter TBT\nand a non-zero optimal length L2.\n\nFor practical reasons, air at atmospheric pressure was chosen as the working fluid, despite\nbeing inappropriate from the performance concerns (most engines make use of pressurized helium).\nTherefore, due to this, the predicted onset of thermoacoustic instability (G > 1) was not reached\nfor all kind of materials, and therefore no formal comparative analysis could be achieved.\n\nThe results obtained in Section 4.3 have not been confirmed by experiments, notably for\nthe reasons mentioned above but also for practical aspects relative to the difficulty in building the\ncomplete engine (for instance, the closed-loop engine equipped with a ceramic catalyst stack is\nimpossible to be built unless bending the TAC). This kind of experimental confirmation has already\nbeen carried on by Guedra et al. (2011), and it is anticipated that it should also succeed here (at least\nfor the prediction of threshold) since the modeling of Sec. 4.3 is nothing else than the propagation\nof plane acoustic waves in lossy ducts.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the works presented here are intrinsically limited to the acoustic\npressure amplitudes for which the linear approximation can be retained. The measurement method\nof Section 3.6 could be, in principle, extended to large amplitudes but some nonlinear processes like\nthe generation of acoustic streaming could not be adequately characterized by this way. Actually,\nthe thermoacoustic amplification gain G should be considered cautiously as soon as G > 1. The\nphysical meaning of a gain significantly larger than unity (e.g. G = 6.88 in Tab. 4.4) is that the\nheated TAC under consideration has a very high potential of thermoacoustic amplification, but it\nis clear that as soon as self-sustained oscillations are generated, the associated heat transport by\nsound (with subsequent variations of the T-matrix components) should be considered.\n\nNow that the so-called Impedance Method has been validated and proved succesful, the\npresent works appeal for several other perspectives. First of all, the existing test-bench could be\nmodified (fitting pieces) to allow the measurements of the T-matrices of the TAC used in other\nexperimental devices at LAUM, and notably two prototypes of thermo-acousto-electric generators.\nA first prototype working with air at 5 bars is already available, while a second one (working with\n\n114\n\n\n\nHelium at 25 bars) is currently under construction. The obtained data should allow verification\nthat the existing engines are well designed (or not), but it could also be helpful in the theoretical\ndescription of the engine (see the following paragraph).\n\nAnother issue concerning the use of the experimental transfer matrices of the TAC deals with\nthe development of an adequate modeling of both acoustic propagation and heat transport through\nthe TAC, involving the solving of an inverse problem. More precisely, the objective is to deter-\nmine unknown parameters using an inverse method so that the theoretical transfer matrix fits the\nexperimental one. The first step is to state the direct problem (notably concerning the simplified de-\nscription of heat transfer through the TAC). The experimental data obtained under various heating\nconditions could be used to determine, from the optimization algorithm, some unknown parame-\nters (e.g. axial and transverse thermal diffusivities of the regenerator) involved in the theoretical\ndescription of heat transfer within the TAC.\n\nFinally, it would be also interesting to perform the measurements of the T-matrix of the TAC\nmentioned above as a function of the acoustic power provided by the impedance sensor to the TAC.\nIn particular, measurements could be performed at large amplitude, for which the linear description\nof thermoacoustic amplification is expected to fail. It is anticipated that both the thermoacoustic\nheat flux and the viscothermal losses could no longer follow a quadratic dependance with acous-\ntic pressure at large amplitudes. Note that the achievement of this task involves purchasing a new\nimpedance sensor which is able to generate high amplitude sound notably in the low frequency\nrange (under 100 Hz) and this kind of device has been recently developed at the Center of Techno-\nlogical Transfer of the Maine university (CTTM).\n\n115\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nADEFF, J.A.; HOFLER, T.J.; ATCHLEY, A.A. e MOSS, W.C.

That means knowing\nthe characteristic time (?) for reaching a sufficiently near constant temperature profile along the\nTAC interior, so that the TTAC coefficients are minimally affected by residual thermal transitions.\nAn easy and reliable way to investigate ? is by taking advantage of the experimental setup for the\ntwo-load method and to measure the time evolution of the transfer functions H?ij stated in Eqs. 3.17\n(or 3.30); by doing so, whenever those thermal conditions are put up with a significant change,\nthe actual acoustical effects can be readily verified not needing to beforehand determine the TTAC\ncoefficients.\n\nAn arbitrary criterion has to be therefore established to define a tolerable level for the H?ij\ntransitory variations, since the complete thermal stability is never reached due unavoidable influ-\nences from the temperature fluctuations of the surrounding ambient, and also due to the external\nacoustic noise generated by the setup equipments. Hence, the proportions H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) are\nevaluated till its variations along the frequency domain are within the criterion limits.\n\nIt is first assumed by common sense stipulation a tolerance deviation of 2 percent in Ampli-\ntude Proportions and of 0.025 rad in the phase differences for the complete frequency spectrum:\n\n0.98 6\n|H?ij(after)|\n|H?ij(before)|\n\n6 1.02, (A.1)\n\n? 0.025rad 6 arg(H?ij(after)) ?arg(H?ij(before)) 6 0.025rad. (A.2)\n\nThe transitory thermal influences derive either from an imposed variation on QH, or from the\nthermal interaction with the circulating water inside the AHX - whose temperature is affected by\nthe natural evaporation at the open surface of its reservoir. That justifies a specific and separated\ninvestigation regarding the water influence prior to beginning the analysis of the QH variation\neffects.\n\n125\n\n\n\nThe preliminary investigation starts with the measurement of H?ij(before) without water cir-\nculation. The Ceramic Catalyst 1 (600 CPSI) is placed inside the TAC. However, special cares\nare taken to ensure as much as possible a uniformity on the temperature distribution throughout\nthe TAC, like having it passed through a long period without any heating at all, to avoid residual\nwarmth from whichever previous experimentation; for this reason, one overnight period is chosen\nsufficient. Additionally, to prevent from body warmth, even hand-touching on the TAC surfaces is\navoided. It is assumed at this point that the ambient air is in a thermal equilibrium with the whole\nTAC device, homogeneously. In the following, the H?ij(before) measurement is made. Once finished,\nthe water circulation is turned on for 12.5min (guessed time period), and, subsequently, the second\nmeasurement H?ij(after) is made while the water is kept circulating. Finally, the proportions reported\nin the statements A.1 and A.2 are put forward, which results in the Figure A.1.\n\n50 100 150 200\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n p\n\nro\np\n\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?0.04\n\n?0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n d\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \n(r\n\na\nd\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A.1: Amplitude proportions and phase differences between the transfer functions measured\nbefore and 12.5 min after turning in the ambient water cooling system for H?21 (solid line), H?31\n(dashed line), and H?43 (dotted line).\n\nOne may clearly see that the referred inequality is not satisfied, and it indicates a non-\nnegligible warmth effect, peculiarly for |H?21| and |H?31| at around 140Hz. Such differences are\n\n126\n\n\n\nconsistent with the fact that, due to the constant presence of the evaporation phenomenon, the wa-\nter contained in the reservoir is always colder that the ambient air - if there are no longer thermal\nremains from any previous heating. Indeed, when actually measuring the temperature in the reser-\nvoir and in the ambient air, for this experiment situation, a fluctuating difference between 0.7\u00baC and\n1.8\u00b0C is verified, depending on the air humidity. Those facts suggest a considerable significance of\nthe evaporation effect, which must be minimized to then continue the transitory analysis taking into\naccount the QH variation effect. In order to do so, before starting with any heating supply, the TAC\ntemperature distribution is stabilized in time with respect to both ambient air and circulating water\nby means of a robust procedure, which is to turn on the water circulation since the day before.\nMoreover, to keep this evaporative effect also minimized for the succeeding measurements with\nheating supply, this procedure is taken as part of the intrinsic preparations from this point forward,\nindependently on the method for the TAC characterization.\n\nTo continue with the transitory regime investigation, the case of the effects due to an imposed\nQH variation is put forward. As previously noted, the inequalities A.1 and A.2 are used as the\nquality parameters. Once the evaporation effects are stabilized, different arbitrary values for QH\nare set, for which the transfer function proportions H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) are measured a predefined\ntime interval of 5min. The QH values are chosen to be representative for the heating situations to\nbe imposed during the TTAC measurements, namely 29.3W , 32.3W and 35.3W . After 12 measure-\nments at QH = 29.3W , the inequalities A.1 and A.2 are well satisfied; indeed, a nearly steady-state\nregime is achieved since the third measurement, i.e., after 15min. Therefore, as it could have been\npredicted, at the 12th measurement the system shows an almost complete thermal stabilization. For\nthis last measurement is attributed H?ij(before). Then, the heating input is changed to QH = 32.3W ;\nafter 5min, it is obtained H?ij(after). The calculation of the corresponding proportions gives the\nresults shown in Figure A.2. In this case, there are deviation peaks over 10 percent, what puts in\nevidence a very important effect, even though it having had 5min already passed.\n\nThe same procedures are repeated for the following measurements, trying to best capture the\nH?ij time evolution. From 10min forward the time increment is diminished from 5min to 1min,\nwhat allowed a more refined evaluation for several time interval combinations. That led to the re-\nsults presented in Figure A.3, which shows the H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) behavior within an interval\nbetween 13 and 18min, counted since the QH transition. For both amplitude proportions and phase\ndifferences the deviation peaks are within the stipulated limit established in the inequalities A.1\nand A.2. That also reveals what may be called a characteristic time \u201d?\u201d, which is therefore approx-\nimately 13min.\n\n127\n\n\n\n50 100 150 200\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\nA\n\nm\np\n\nlit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n p\nro\n\np\no\n\nrt\nio\n\nn\ns\n\n50 100 150 200\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n d\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \n(r\n\na\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure A.2: Amplitude proportions and phase differences between the transfer functions measured\njust before and 5min after the transition of heating input from QH = 29.3W to QH = 32.3W for\nH?21 (solid line), H?31 (dashed line), and H?43 (dotted line).\n\nIn conclusion, this transitory regime investigation assures that the evaporation effects are\nsuppressed if the water circulation is turned on at the overnight before the experiments, and it\nalso indicates that a time delay of 13min is sufficient to minimize the transient effects of the QH\nvariation. However, the latter is supported on the constraints A.1 and A.2, which are stipulated by\na common sense guessing to start an iterative process, hopefully a well-done trial. Indeed, when\nobtaining the TTAC coefficients later on, the transitory investigation is validated and, consequently,\nthose constraints are proved to be well guessed. Although these results are obtained only for the\nCeramic Catalyst 1 circumstance by means of the Two-Load method setup, it is assumed that they\ncan be equally considered for the other materials as well, for all TAC characterization approaches\ntreated here.\n\n128\n\n\n\n50 100 150 200\n0.98\n\n0.99\n\n1\n\n1.01\n\n1.02\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n p\n\nro\np\n\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\ns\n\n50 100 150 200\n\n?0.02\n\n?0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n d\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \n(r\n\na\nd\n\n)\n\nFigure A.3: Amplitude proportions and phase differences between the transfer functions measured\n13 and 18min both after the transition of heating input from QH = 29.3W to QH = 32.3W for\nH?21 (solid line), H?31 (dashed line), and H?43 (dotted line).\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\nAP\u00caNDICE B Calibration for the Two-Load Method\n\nIt is a necessary precaution to carry out all standard procedures so as to pursuing the lesser\nsignificant error propagation. This case-study is not an exception. On the contrary: in this method\nthe indirectness of the TTAC measurement is very important, what may compel the errors impact\nto devalue or even invalidate the whole experimentation. Thereby, the calibration is put into prac-\ntice with close attention to employing well suited and clean equipment, and avoiding, as much as\npossible, sound leakage by means of vacuum grease spreading in all joints and connections.\n\nThe four microphones are subjected to both absolute and relative calibration. In the first\ninstance, it is proved that there are important differences between manufacturer\u2019s values and the\nactual measured ones just before the experimentation.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the absolute calibration is a priori unnecessary since the measured acous-\ntic pressures are considered at once in the transfer functions reported in Eq. 3.17 (or Eq. 3.30), in\nwhich the proportions intrinsically dismiss the need for knowing the microphone sensitivities. That\nsaid, a solely relative calibration would be sufficient to go on then with the actual transfer function\nmeasurements, not requiring so the absolute one. Notwithstanding, in order to prevent eventual ma-\njor measurement distortions, and also because it is simple to be effectuated, an absolute calibration\nis justified in this work.\n\nSubsequently, the relative calibration is proceeded. The microphones are flush mounted one\npair at a time at both sides of a chamber device, small enough to ensure their exposure to the same\nacoustic pressure for the frequency range of interest. Three pairs of microphone combinations are\nchosen, in accordance with the transfer function arranges stated in Equations 3.17, namely micros\n1-2, 1-3, and 3-4. The schematic of the calibration device is shown in Fig. B.1.\n\nThese measurements are associated in the expressions in the following, which are actually\ntransfer functions.\n\nC?21 =\np?2cal\np?1cal\n\n, C?31 =\np?3cal\np?1cal\n\n, C?43 =\np?4cal\np?3cal\n\n. (B.1)\n\n131\n\n\n\nClearance\n\nCavity\n\nMic 1 Mic 2\n\nCompression chamber\n\nFigure B.1: Detail of the calibration device showing the two micros and the small cavity as the\ncoupling volume submitted to uniform acoustic pressures provided by the compression chamber.\n\nKnowing that the actual acoustic pressure is the same for each pair of microphones, one can\nconclude that any deviation from the unity in the relations of Eq. B.1 is due to the differences of\nsensitivity. If these ratios divide the corresponding transfer functions 3.17, then those differences\nhave their effects canceled. The resulting transfer functions become calibrated, as following.\n\nH?21cal =\nH?21\n\nC?21\n,H?31cal =\n\nH?31\n\nC?31\n,H?43cal =\n\nH?43\n\nC?43\n. (B.2)\n\nThe frequency range and its incremental step must be the same as the ones employed for the\nactual TTAC measurement, to keep the exact vectorial matching and hence to achieve the calibrat-\ning correction for each specific frequency. That means an acoustic field also ranging from 50 to\n200Hz and paced with a constant increment of 1Hz. A signal generator is directly connected to\na loudspeaker, which in this small chamber case works as a compressor, to produce that acoustic\nfield. Also because of the chamber small size, the use of a signal amplifier is dismissed, as the\nrequired acoustic power input is proportionally small.\n\nThe results in Figure B.2 illustrates how important the calibration is. Although not impressive,\nin the order of 1 percent, the deviations may be clearly seen in the amplitude ratios and in the\nphase differences as well; they also indicate that their behaviors are not abnormal and there are no\nmalfunctions in the whole instrumentation. All transfer functions considered in this approach are\ncalibrated as in B.2.\n\n132\n\n\n\nIt is very important to note that, in order to simplify the notation for the transfer functions,\nthe H?ijcal terms have no longer the subscript cal from this point on. Thus, the sole description H?ij\nis presumed to indicate a previous calibration, implicitly, when substituting them into Eqs. 3.26 to\n3.29, to finally obtain the TTAC coefficients.\n\n50 100 150 200\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n r\n\na\ntio\n\n \n\n \n\n50 100 150 200\n?0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFrequence (Hz)\n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n d\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\n (\nra\n\nd\n)\n\n \n\n \n\namp2/amp1\namp3/amp1\namp4/amp3\n\nphi2?phi1\nphi3?phi1\nphi4?phi3\n\nFigure B.2: Calibrating corrections expressed as the spectra of amplitude ratio and phase difference\nbetween acoustic pressures as stated in equations B.1.\n\n133\n\n\n\n\n\nAP\u00caNDICE C Calibration for the Impedance Method\n\nThe calibration is conducted simply by placing the third microphone at entrance of the AIS,\nand taking impedance measurements just as explained in Chapter 3.
