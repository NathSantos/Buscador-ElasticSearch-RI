However, little has been said on the dynamics of the geological processes causally related\nto the cladogenetic events between these areas. Distributional and phylogenetic patterns suggest a close association with the\ngeological history of the passive continental margin of South America, from the Cretaceous to the present day. In this area\nmegadome uplifts, rifting, vertical movements between rifted blocks and the erosive retreat of the South American eastern\ncontinental margin are hypothesized as the main geological forces controlling the distribution of freshwater fishes. The\ntectonic activity associated with the break-up of Gondwana and separation of South America and Africa formed six megadomes\nthat control most of the current courses of the main crystalline shield river basins. Except for basins located at the edges of\nsuch megadomes, these river systems developed long, circuitous routes over the ancient Brazilian crystalline shield before\nemptying into the recently opened Atlantic Ocean. Initial cladogenetic events between upland crystalline drainages and\nAtlantic tributaries were probably associated with vicariant processes, and some ancient basal sister-groups of widespread\ninclusive taxa are found in these coastal hydrographic systems. Later, generalized erosive denudation resulted in an isostatic\nadjustment of the eastern margin of the platform. These, along with reactivations of ancient rifts led to vertical movements\nbetween rifted blocks and gave rise, in southeastern Brazil, to taphrogenic (rift related) basins. These basins, such as the\nTaubat\u00e9, S\u00e3o Paulo, Curitiba and Volta Redonda basins, among others, captured adjacent upland drainages and fauna. The\nfossil fishes from the Trememb\u00e9 Formation (Eocene-Oligocene of Taubat\u00e9 Basin) exemplify this process. Other taphrogenic\nsystems of Tertiary age were also identified in other segments of the Atlantic continental margin, such as in Borborema\nprovince, in NE Brazil, with marked influence over drainage patterns. At the same time, erosive retreat of the eastern margin of\nthe platform successively captured upland rivers, which became Atlantic tributaries evolving associated to main rift systems.\nThe continued nature of these processes explains the mixed phylogenetic and distributional patterns between Atlantic tribu-\ntaries and the upland crystalline shield areas, especially in the southeastern continental margin, represented by successively,\nless inclusive sister-groups associated with cladogenetic events from the Late Cretaceous to the present.\n\nAs drenagens costeiras do leste do Brasil correspondem a \u00e1reas de grande significado biogeogr\u00e1fico, apresentando um alto\ngrau de endemismo em sua fauna de peixes.

The actual number of species, however,\ncould reach 8,000 according to recent estimates (Schaefer,\n1998; Vari &amp; Malabarba, 1998). The reasons for such a pro-\nnounced diversity are likely to be both historical and ecologi-\ncal \u2013 a result of millions of years of evolution from the break\nup of Gondwana to the present.\n\nThe biogeography of the Neotropical ichthyofauna, how-\never, is poorly known. According to Vari &amp; Weitzman (1990),\nthree major factors limit the precision of hypotheses about\nthe historical biogeography of South American freshwater\nfishes: 1) the poor state of knowledge of the species-level\nsystematics of most taxa; 2) inadequate distributional infor-\nmation for most species, and; 3) sparse or non-existent data\non the phylogenetic history of most supraspecific taxa. An\nadditional reason can be added: 4) the difficulties in associat-\ning phylogenetic hypotheses and the known geological his-\ntory of the continent. If biogeography is, as defined by Nelson\n(1985), \u201cthe interrelationship, or synthesis, of geology and\nbiology\u201d, the difficulties of biologists in understanding and\nsynthesizing geological processes constitute a serious limi-\ntation to our knowledge of the biogeography of Neotropical\nfreshwater fishes.\n\nMost of the information available on the biogeography of\nNeotropical freshwater fishes comes from phylogenetic data\nderived from revisionary studies of particular groups, in which\nattempts were made to clarify relationships between areas of\nendemism based on analyses of area cladogram (e.g. Vari,\n1988; Schaefer, 1997; Reis, 1998; Vari &amp; Harold, 2001; Costa,\n2001). When available, geological inferences in these studies\nwere made based on major well understood geological events,\nsuch as the uplift of the Andean cordilleras.\n\nRecently, Lundberg et al. (1998) provided a detailed chro-\nnological synthesis of the geological history of South America\nwritten for ichthyologists in general. Their very useful contri-\nbution focuses, however, on the uplift of the Andean cordil-\nleras, major seaway transgressions along the slope of the\nAndes along the western margin of the South American Plat-\n\nform, and the paleodrainages of the northwest and northern\nportions of the continent in the Guyana Shield and Amazon\nbasin. Few data were provided about the remaining areas of\nthe South American Platform, where large hydrographic ba-\nsins, such as the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay, S\u00e3o Francisco and the\nclosely related Atlantic slope coastal rivers, drain the oldest\nterrenes of the continent: the ancient Brazilian crystalline\nshield.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the\nprincipal aspects of geological history of the passive conti-\nnental margin of eastern South America and explain the bio-\ngeographic history of the fish fauna from the Brazilian crys-\ntalline shield, focusing mainly on the coastal drainages of\neastern Brazil, with a special emphasis on the southeastern\ncontinental margin. This area has an ancient biogeographic\ncomponent as exemplified by the occurrence of several groups\nof fishes, which are phylogenetically basal to widespread\nclades that underwent subsequent diversification in most\nhydrographic basins in South America. These early cladoge-\nnetic events were associated with the initial stage of the geo-\nmorphological evolution of the eastern South American con-\ntinental margin, involving tectonics and erosive process that\ntook place during and after the break up of Gondwana. These\nprocesses are, to a degree, still active today.\n\nContinental geological overview\n\nThe South American Platform (Fig. 1) is defined, as the\nstable continental portion of the South American plate not\naffected by the Caribbean and Andean orogenic zones\n(Almeida et al., 2000). It is formed by the Brazilian Platform\nand by the Patagonian Platform. The structural provinces of\nthe South American Platform are identified according to their\norigin as the cratonic areas, ancient orogenic belts, and sedi-\nmentary basins (Almeida et al., 1981), as indicated in Fig. 1.\n\nCratons represent the most stable region of the continent\ncomposed of Precambrian rocks. During orogenic cycles, these\nareas behave as rigid blocks, with mobile belts developing\naround them. When eroded and exposed, cratons are called\nshields (Penha, 1998). The South American Platform has the\nfollowing cratons: Amazonian, S\u00e3o Francisco, Rio de la Plata,\nS\u00e3o Luiz, and Luiz Alves (Cordani et al., 2000) (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 227\n\nThe same mobile interactions between plates that occur\ntoday also occurred during most of the geological history of\nthe earth, during which different portions of present day South\nAmerica were involved in the amalgamation and break-up of\nseveral ancient super-continents during the so-called oro-\ngenic cycles, such as the Atlantida (Paleoproterozoic), Rodinia\n(Mezoproterozoic), Western Gondwana (Neoproterozoic), and\nPangea (Carboniferous) supercontinents (Cordani et al., 2000;\nSaenz et al., 2003). A result of this continental amalgamation\nwas the development of an orogenic or mobile belt. Most of\nthe ancient orogenic belts found in the South American Plat-\nform are derived from three main sets of orogenic events: 1)\nTrans-Amazonian (Paleoproterozoic); 2) late Mesoproterozoic\nand; 3) Brasiliano/Pan African (Almeida et al., 2000). Most of\nthe orogenic structural provinces of the South American Plat-\n\nform resulted from the Brasiliano/Pan African orogenic cycle,\nwhen several cratonic nuclei (Amazonian, S\u00e3o Francisco, S\u00e3o\nLuiz, Rio de la Plata, in South America and the West African,\nKongo and Kalahari in Africa) amalgamated in the Western\nGondwana continent between 750 and 530 Ma (Cordani et al.,\n2000). As shown in Fig. 1, the ancient orogenic belts of the\nSouth American Platform are the Borborema, Mantiqueira and\nTocantins provinces, and the Dom Feliciano belt. Today, the\nmetamorphic rocks present in these areas (meta-volcano-sedi-\nmentary rocks) represent the roots of those eroded ancient\nmountain chains of orogenic origin.\n\nIn the South American Platform, sedimentary basins\nevolved in a different set of tectono-sedimentary domains, as\nshown in Fig. 2. These are: 1) the continent\u2019s interior, filled\nprimarily by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary sequences,\n\nFig. 1. Crustal provinces of South America. I \u2013 South American Platform; II \u2013 Patagonian massif; III \u2013 Andean orogenic belt;\nIV \u2013 foreland basins; AM = Amazon craton; SL = S\u00e3o Luis craton; SF = S\u00e3o Francisco craton; LA = Luiz Alves craton; RP = Rio\nde la Plata craton; B = Borborema province; T = Tocantins province; M = Mantiqueira province; DF = Dom Feliciano belt.\n(Modified from Cordani et al., 2000 and Cordani &amp; Sato, 1999).\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil228\n\nbut also by Cenozoic sequences; 2) the western, convergent\ncontinental domain, the Andean chain, with its related sedi-\nmentary basins; 3) the northern and southern margins of the\nSouth American plate, where its contact and interacts with\nthe Caribbean and Scotia plates, and; 4) the eastern, diver-\ngent continental margin of the continent that is derived from\nthe break-up of South America and Africa, where the sedi-\nmentary sequence evolved in different sets of sedimentary\nenvironments and tectonic phases since the Mesozoic (Milani\n&amp; Thomaz-Filho, 2000) (Fig. 2).\n\nAssociated with the main structural and tectonic sedi-\nmentary provinces in the South American Platform are com-\nplex systems of ancient faults, as well as widespread intru-\nsive and extrusive volcanism. These are heritages of the con-\ntinental amalgamation during the orogenic cycles together\n\nwith the rifting process related to the break-up of the precur-\nsor super-continent in which the present day South America\nwas involved. Rifting and magmatism associated with the\nbreak-up of Gondwana are found in most tectonic and sedi-\nmentary provinces of the South American Platform (Thomaz-\nFilho et al., 2000).\n\nTectonic evolution of the eastern margin of South America\n\nThe eastern margin of the South American Platform be-\nlongs to a kind of continental margin known as \u201cPassive\u201d or\n\u201cAtlantic-Style\u201d margin. According to Moores &amp; Twiss (1995),\nin this kind of margin, the continental basement is more slen-\nder toward the margin as a result of extensive faulting. In\nsome regions, fault-bounded basins (taphrogenic basins) of\ncontinental deposits are present on top of the crystalline base-\n\nFig. 2. The South American Plate and its major tectono-sedimentary domains (from Milani &amp; Thomaz-Filho, 2000).\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 229\n\nment. There are, in addition, flows of igneous rocks within\nthe upper stratigraphic levels of the rift valley sediments\n(Moores &amp; Twiss, 1995). According to Thomas (1995) and\nVitte (2001), there are six major tectonic features controlling\nthe long-term morphological evolution of passive margins: 1)\nuplift controlled by the action of hot spots (thermal driven\nuplift); 2) isostatic uplift due to denudation and unloading on\nemerged areas; 3) thermally driven subsidence; 4) isostatic\nsubsidence due to sediment loading offshore; 5) rotation of\ncontinental margin resulting from 4; and 6) escarpment ero-\nsive retreat.\n\nThe tectonic processes responsible for imposing the \u201cAt-\nlantic-Style\u201d of the eastern margin of the South America Plat-\nform are ancient, probably active since the Triassic, repre-\nsenting the initial phase of the break-up of Gondwana.\n\nThe chronology of the South American and African break-\nup indicates distinct phases of magmatic activity related to a\nrifting process (Thomaz-Filho et al., 2000). The first rifting\nbegan on the Brazilian equatorial margin from French Guyana\nto the Amazon delta in the Maraj\u00f3 basin between 230 and 170\nmillion year ago, with two phases of a more pronounced mag-\nmatic activity (during Triassic and Jurassic times). Rifting\n\nalso took place during the Triassic, in the southern portion of\nSouth America as deduced by the presence of significant rift-\nrelated Triassic magmatic rocks in the marginal San Julian\nand North Malvinas basins. Between 170 and 120 million years\nago, rifting took place along the Argentinean, Uruguayan\nand Brazilian coasts reaching as far as Esp\u00edrito Santo basin.\nAt the same time, the clockwise rotation of South America\nresulted in wrenching between faults that were occurring on\nthe northeastern Brazilian equatorial margin (Thomaz-Filho\net al., 2000).\n\nBeginning in the Triassic, the paleogeography of the At-\nlantic continental margins of South America and Africa un-\nderwent dramatic change due to a major tectonic event: the\nWealdenian Reactivation (Almeida, 1967; Cesero &amp; Ponte,\n1997) or South Atlantic Event (Schobbenhaus et al., 1984). In\nthe initial phase, between the Triassic and Jurassic period, a\nsingle, large, longitudinally elongated basin (extending from\n0 to 20\u00baS) the Afro-Brazilian Depression, arose due to the\nrifting process (Da Rosa &amp; Garcia, 2000). This basin captured\nthe adjacent drainages thereby giving rise to an intercon-\nnected lake system, similar to that of present day eastern\nAfrican lakes. The Afro-Brazilian Depression continued to\n\nFig. 3. Rivers and uplifts of Atlantic South America. A) break-up uplifts (megadomes) and associated principal rifts.

B) detail of the uplift from\nthe Southeastern Brazil (from Cox, 1989 and Potter, 1997).\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil230\n\nevolve as a consequence of the processes of tectonic break-\nup (Da Rosa &amp; Garcia, 2000). It has been suggested that the\nAfro-Brazilian Depression became divided into a set of smaller\nbasins during the rift phase, following the primary axes of\nfault systems of the eastern Brazilian margin (for example, the\nSouza, Igat\u00fa, Jatob\u00e1 and Araripe basins, associated to the\nPatos and Pernambuco fault lineaments, in the northeastern\nBrazil) (Da Rosa &amp; Garcia, 2000). As a consequence of the\nreactivation, there also arose several new fault systems along\nthe coast and in the Brazilian interior, as well as the rise of\nseveral rift basins. Examples of these basins are the Tacutu\nand the Maraj\u00f3 graben, in northernmost Brazil, neighboring\nGuiana, and in the Amazon delta, respectively; the complex\nsystem of rift basins Rec\u00f4ncavo-Tucano-Jatob\u00e1, S\u00e3o Luiz\nand Barreirinhas in northeastern Brazil, among others (Potter,\n1997; Milani &amp; Thomaz-Filho, 2000).\n\nThe African and the South American continents became\ncompletely separated between 98 and 93 million years ago\n(end of middle Cretaceous) (Cesero &amp; Ponte, 1997). From that\nperiod to the present continental drift has occurred between\nthese two continents, with peaks of magmatic activities in the\nEocene and Oligocene. In some cases, such activity was a\nconsequence of hot spots, such as that responsible for the\nalignment between the Po\u00e7os de Caldas/Cabo Frio continen-\ntal alkaline rocks to the volcanic chain of Vit\u00f3ria/Trindade in\nthe offshore area of southeastern Brazil (Almeida et al., 1996;\nThomaz-Filho &amp; Rodrigues, 1999; Thomaz-Filho et al., 2000).\nRecently, an alternative nonplume related heat source for the\ngeneration of intracontinental magmatic provinces has been\nproposed to explain the occurrence of magmatic bodies in\nSouth America (Ernesto et al., 2002).\n\nAmong the most important implications for the biogeog-\nraphy of the aquatic continental biota resulting from the South\nAtlantic event is the tectonically imposed paleodrainage of\nthe Brazilian crystalline shield. According to the model de-\nscribed by Cox (1989), upper mantle plumes created an arched\ndeformation hundreds of kilometers in width during the initial\nphase of rifting that imposed a characteristic drainage pat-\ntern, with rivers running out from the center of the megadome\ndeformation. This process supposedly acted on several por-\ntions of the continental margins of Africa and South America,\ngiving rise to six main magadomes (Potter, 1997). The drain-\nage patterns created by these areas of uplift are still evident,\nas shown in Fig. 3. Of all the major South American rivers, the\nParan\u00e1 seems to have the most perfect fit to those structures\n(Potter, 1997); however, this tectonic pattern is also evident\nin the headwaters and mouth of the rio S\u00e3o Francisco (Fig. 3).\nOther than those rivers that evolved along edge of these arched\ndeformations, the Mesozoic reactivation resulted in drainage\npatterns in which the river systems developed long, circuitous\nroutes over the ancient Brazilian crystalline shield before dis-\ncharging into the recently opened Atlantic Ocean (Potter, 1997).\n\nWith the end of the reactivation and of the related com-\nplete break-up of Gondwana, the history of independent South\nAmerican Atlantic rivers began. These rivers form a series of\nisolated hydrographic basins known as the Coastal Drain-\n\nages of Eastern Brazil, with the primary hydrographic sys-\ntems being the rios Paragua\u00e7\u00fa, Contas, Jequitinhonha, Doce,\nPara\u00edba do Sul, Ribeira de Iguape, Itaja\u00ed and Jacu\u00ed (Fig. 4).\nThese, along with several other smaller isolated basins, are\nseparated by the scarped, mountainous landscapes of the\neastern margin of the Brazilian crystalline shield.\n\nAlong the eastern coastal margin of South America, the\npost-Cretaceous history of the southeastern segment of the\ncontinent, in southeastern Brazil, is better understood. Ac-\ncording to Cobbold et al. (2001), the obliquely rifted margin\nof southeastern Brazil is characterized by a tectonic context\nthat contrasts with the traditional view in which the Atlantic\nmargin of Brazil is a passive margin. These authors interpret\nthe late Cretaceous and Cenozoic reactivation of older struc-\ntures, attributing them to the combined effect of far-field stress\n(related to the Andean uplift) and hot-spot activity (the\nTrindade hot-spot). A large number of seismic events are re-\nported in southeastern Brazil related to neighbouring regions.\nPatterns of topography and drainages provide evidence of\nrecent uplift, block faulting and river capture, all of which are\nsymptomatic of active tectonics. Inland, the crust of the re-\ngion appears to be thicker than normal and decidedly thicker\nthan what is expected for a rifted margin, probably due to\nCenozoic shortening that originated from the action of conti-\nnent-wide compressional stress. The lithosphere of south-\neastern Brazil is relatively weak relative to adjacent cratonic\nareas, and weaknesses probably explain why this region is\nseismically active and prone to deformations. Alkaline intru-\nsions of Late Cretaceous-Paleogene age are relatively com-\nmon and related to hot-spot activity or fault reactivation.\nOnshore and offshore geological evidence leads to the con-\nclusion that the margin of southeastern Brazil was reactivated\nin three main phases and separated by quieter intervals that\ncoincide with the Peruvian (90-75 Ma), Incaic (50-40 Ma) and\nQuechuan (25-0 Ma) phases of Andean orogeny, which oc-\ncurred during periods of relatively rapid convergence at the\nAndean margin of South America. Also, the kinematics of\nCenozoic deformation in southeastern Brazil is compatible\nwith the changing directions of convergence at the Andean\nmargin, which was highly oblique in the Paleogene and much\nless so in the Neogene (Cobbold et al., 2001).\n\nAlmeida &amp; Carneiro (1998) provided geological evidence\nthat, at the end of the Cretaceous, the southeastern Brazilian\ncrystalline shield extended eastward into the present day in-\nner continental platform. The shield extended to the edge of\nthe Santos Basin, an offshore sedimentary basin now filled\nwith about 13,000 m of sediments, the oldest of which dates\nback to the Late Cretaceous (100 Ma). This Late Cretaceous\nsedimentary sequence of the Santos Basin is the counterpart\nof the sequence of the same age found in the Baur\u00fa group\n(Paran\u00e1 Basin), and both represent the erosive denudation\ncycle of the Brazilian crystalline shield that has taken place\nalong the eastern margin of the continent from that period to\nthe present (Fig. 5). The continental crust of southeastern\nBrazil suffered a vertical denudation of about 3 km, exposing\ndeep metamorphic rocks of the ancient Ribeira and\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 231\n\nMantiqueira orogenic belts (Gallagher et al., 1994). Accord-\ning to Almeida &amp; Carneiro (1998), the reduction of weight as\na consequence of the erosive process in the crust, and its\nincrease in offshore basins, provided an uplift of the former\nand lowering of the latter due to an isostatic adjustment. The\nisostatic epirogenesis of the eastern margin of the South\n\nAmerican Platform also resulted in movements between rifted\nblocks (reactivation of old rifts), and was the main reason for\nthe origin of several taphrogenic basins or grabens (basins\noriginating by the lowering of rifted blocks) such as that of\nthe \u201cSerra do Mar Rift System,\u201d which includes the Taubat\u00e9,\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Resende, Volta Redonda, Curitiba, Sete Barras,\n\nFig. 4.

These movements also led to verti-\ncal movements recently reported for other areas, such as that\nresponsible of the origin of the Canan\u00e9ia and the Barra de\nS\u00e3o Joaquim grabens in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de\nJaneiro (Souza et al., 1996; Mohriak &amp; Barros, 1990). How-\never, according to Riccomini et al. (2004) these basins origi-\nnated due to reactivations of the sub-parallel NE to E-W Pre-\ncambrian shear zones, know as the Continental Rift of South-\neastern Brazil (CRSB). This tectonic feature initially named as\nthe \u201cSerra do Mar Rift System\u201d (Almeida, 1976) is now iden-\ntified as one of the largest structural discontinuities of the\nSouth American Platform, extending considerably beyond the\nSerra do Mar itself. The CRSB is an elongate narrow trough,\nover 900 km long, and roughly parallels the present-day coast\nline of southeastern Brazil, reaching the Atlantic Ocean in the\nnortheast of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Riccomini et al.,\n2004) (Figs. 6 and 7).\n\nThe evolutionary history of the CRSB was the focus of\nseveral theories (Riccomini et al., 2004), along with the most\nrecent recognizes that the system evolved in response to an\n\ncombined effect of tectonic forces related to the spreading\nrates in the Middle Atlantic Ridge (ridge-push); far-field com-\npressional stress related to the Andean orogeny (slab-pull);\nthe activity of the Trindade hot spot; isostatic adjustments\ndue to relief of height after extensive erosion of the ancient\nBrazilian shield; effects of the subsidence of the adjoining\noffshore Santos Basin; and oscillation of water pressures\nover the continental platform related to sea level changes\nduring the Late Pleistocene (Almeida &amp; Carneiro, 1998;\nRiccomini &amp; Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 1999; Cobbold et al., 2001; Riccomini\net al., 2004). According to recent models, during the Paleo-\ngene reactivation of Precambrian shear zones as normal faults\nwas responsible for creating the original depression encom-\npassing all the basins of the central to northeastern segment\nof the rift. In the Neogene, probably during the Miocene,\nreactivation of the rift was responsible for the first\ndeformational event. In the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, a sec-\nond deformational event took place; faults located at the edges\nof the basin were reactivated and gave rise to structural highs\nthat configure the separation of the Paleogene sedimentary\nrecord in different basins. A third deformational event in the\nHolocene has been confirmed and there are evidences for the\naction of a younger stress field active until the present-day\n(Riccomini &amp; Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 1999). These deformational pro-\ncesses were basement-controlled, mostly resulting from re-\nactivation of Precambrian shear zones (Riccomini et al., 2004).\n\nThe escarpment erosive retreat was concomitant with the\ntectonic deformations described above and these together\ndelimited the evolution of drainage patterns. Due to the break-\nup of Gondwana, several old faults were reactivated in dis-\ncontinued pulses from the end of the Cretaceous to the Ter-\ntiary. The rocks of the reactivated faults, with their lesser\nresistance to erosion, govern the plan of the drainage pattern\n(Almeida &amp; Carneiro, 1998). With the continued erosive re-\ntreat, various rivers of the upland crystalline shield were cap-\ntured, primarily along rift systems, to become Atlantic Ocean\ntributaries; a process that is still active in the present.\n\nThe generalized model of drainage pattern evolution in-\nvolving isostatic epirogenesis, tectonic activity and the E-W\nerosive retreat of the eastern margin of the South American\n\nFig. 5.

C. Ribeiro 233\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil234\n\nPlatform predicts that the river systems associated with the\nmain fault systems which are more susceptible to erosion will\ncapture the headwaters of some crystalline shield tributaries.\nAt the same time, vertical movements between faulted blocks\ngave rise to taphrogenic basins, which capture surrounding\nheadwaters, originating a complex hydrography, sometimes\nrepresented by interconnected lake systems. Resistant areas,\nsuch as the complex systems of intruded basalts and other\nmetamorphic rocks, sustain upland and become exposed in\nsteep scarps (Almeida &amp; Carneiro, 1998). One of the most\noutstanding examples of such a process is the erosive retreat\nof the Ribeira de Iguape basin, which is responsible for carv-\ning a gap in the coastal Serra do Mar range, between S\u00e3o\nPaulo and Paran\u00e1 States. This resulted from the erosive re-\ntreat of this river system in the Lancinha-Cubat\u00e3o rifted zone\n(Almeida &amp; Carneiro, 1998) (Fig. 6c).\n\nThe evolution of taphrogenic basins are of crucial impor-\ntance for the hydrographic system established between the\nend of the Cretaceous to the Tertiary. Once developed, these\nbasins were responsible for headwater captures between ad-\njacent upland hydrographic systems. In the case of the\nTaubat\u00e9 basin, the capture of an arm of the rio Tiet\u00ea was\npreviously reported by Ab\u2019S\u00e1ber (1957, 1998); however, this\nwas not the only paleohydrological consequence of that\ntaphrogenic event. The origin of the Taubat\u00e9 Graben prob-\nably resulted in the capture of several other adjacent rivers,\nsuch as headwaters of the rivers Tiet\u00ea, Grande, S\u00e3o Fran-\ncisco, and probably Doce. The strategic position of the\nTaubat\u00e9 Graben, in the core of the Mantiqueira-Angola re-\ngional megadome, from where headwaters of all the quad-\nrants originate (Fig. 3) (Ab\u2019S\u00e1ber, 1998), suggests a much\nmore complicated hydrological history than is usually pro-\nposed by some simplified biogeographic scenarios (see e.g.\nMalabarba, 1998).\n\nTertiary taphrogenic system was also detected in north-\neastern Brazil, in the Borborema Province (Brito Neves et al.,\n2004). Reactivations along ancient faults during Paleogene\ntimes created a system of grabens and horsts, which are evi-\ndent in present day landforms (the Cariat\u00e1 and rio\nMamanguape grabens, respectively) and the adjacent upland\n(the Boqueir\u00e3o horst) in the State of Para\u00edba, NE Brazil (Fig.\n8). This taphrogenic system imposes a tectonic control over\nthe local hydrography, capturing to the Cariat\u00e1 Graben seg-\nments of the local drainages, and deviating the upper stretch\nof the rio Para\u00edba from a N-S direction to its local E-W direc-\ntion to the coast (Brito Neves et al., 2004). These more local\nphenomena illustrate how tectonic activities control drainage\nevolution in all scales along the eastern rifted continental\nmargin of the Brazilian Platform (Figs. 6-8).\n\nAccording to Riccomini &amp; Assump\u00e7\u00e3o (1999), the con-\ncept of Quaternary tectonic stability prevailed for most of the\nBrazilian Platform and, because of this fact, investigation of\nQuaternary tectonics in Brazil has began to develop only in\nthe last decade. The summary of Quaternary tectonics in Bra-\nzil presented by these authors indicates the existence of Qua-\nternary, particularly Holocene, faulting in almost all Brazilian\n\ngeological provinces. Among these, the region of the Conti-\nnental Rift of Southeastern Brazil underwent the most pro-\nnounced and recent activities and reactivations of ancient\nstructural lines (faults and shear zones) and generation of\nnew faults (Riccomini &amp; Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 1999). This Quaternary\ntectonic activity causes, among other topographic changes,\nrecent drainage rearrangements caused by stream captures\n(Modenesi-Guattieri et al., 2002). Saadi (1993) and Saadi et al.\n(2002) interpret the Quaternary tectonics in Brazil as being\nthe result of reactivation along ancient crustal discontinuities\n(Pre-Cambrian and Mesozoic rift and shear zones) that be-\nhave as weakness zones and are more prone to undergo de-\nformations.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene and Holocene the coast of South\nAmerica underwent marine transgressions due primarily to\nclimate changes and sea level fluctuations (Suguio et al.,\n1985).\n\nDistribution, phylogenetic patterns, and the biogeography\n\nof the fish fauna from the Brazilian continental margin.\n\nDistributional patterns\n\nThe ichthyofauna of the coastal drainages of eastern Bra-\nzil is of great biogeographic significance. The main hydro-\ngraphic systems (Paragua\u00e7\u00fa, Contas, Jequitinhonha, Doce,\nPara\u00edba do Sul, Ribeira de Iguape, Itaja\u00ed and Jacu\u00ed) (Fig. 4), as\nwell as several other smaller adjacent drainages, demonstrate\na high degree of endemism. Of a total of 285 fish species\nlisted by Bizerril (1994) for these basins, 95% were consid-\nered endemic and with 23.4% of the genera endemic.\n\n Interesting biogeographic patterns are exhibited by the\nfreshwater ichthyofaunas on the Brazilian crystalline shield\nand the Atlantic coastal drainages. Potentially informative\npatterns are exhibited by deep phylogenetic lineages as well\nas closely related species groups occurring in coastal drain-\nages and the adjacent upland crystalline shield rivers.\n\nThe phylogenetic scope of these patterns suggests that\ncladogenetic events between coastal drainages and the up-\nland crystalline shield are ongoing over long stretches of\ntime, and were in a sense repetitive, giving rise to similar\nsister-group phylogenetic patterns, which occurred in differ-\nent time stages. These differences in the degree of inclusive-\nness between sister-groups probably reflect such sequence\nof continuous vicariance. In general, species-level patterns\nshould be the most recent events whereas higher taxonomic\ngroup patterns are older.\n\nIn some cases, the degree of inclusiveness involve taxa\nwhich are the sister group of very large clades at familial or\nsubfamilial levels (herein termed Pattern A) (Fig. 9) or in other\ncases, involving sister-group relationships between genera\n(Pattern B) (Fig. 10). These patterns, along with the species-\nlevel similarities between both areas (Pattern C) will be dis-\ncussed separately. Unfortunately, due to the lack of phyloge-\nnetic information for many groups occurring in eastern Brazil,\nthe patterns hypothesized herein are not supported by nu-\nmerous examples, but these can be tested by future study.\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 235\n\nFig. 7.

(b) Detail of the straight course of the rio Para\u00edba do Sul Rift\nValley produced from a digital elevation model by radar interferometry (NASA, The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission).\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil236\n\nAncient events: Pattern A\n\nStiassny &amp; Pinna (1994) noticed that taxa basal within\ntheir lineages are often notably depauperate in number of\nspecies when compared with their sister-groups, and fre-\nquently have extremely restricted geographical distributions.\nAccording to the same authors, this phenomenon is strik-\ningly prevalent among freshwater fishes. Some coastal drain-\nages of eastern Brazil are inhabited by taxa that are primary\nexamples of such fact (Stiassny &amp; Pinna, 1994). This is desig-\nnated herein as Pattern A.\n\nPattern A is exemplified by the Trichomycteridae catfishes\nof the subfamilies Trichogeninae (genus Trichogenes) and\nCopionodontinae (genera Glaphyropoma, and Copionodon).\nThese catfishes are endemic to the small Atlantic tributaries\nbetween S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (in the SE) and to the\nrio Paragua\u00e7u basin (NE Brazil), respectively. Trichogeninae\nand Copionodontinae are probably sister-groups and together\nconstitute the sister-group of the remaining members of the\nTrichomycteridae (Pinna, 1998) (Fig. 9a). The cladogenesis\nseparating Copionodontinae and Trichogeninae catfishes from\nthe remaining Trichomycteridae is, probably, of great antiq-\nuity. Trichomycterids excluding Copionodontinae and\nTrichogeninae underwent a long evolutionary history giving\nrise to more than 200 described species arranged in more then\n42 genera, with widespread Trans/Cis-andean distributional\nranges from Patagonia to Panama. Trichomycterids, in the\ncourse of their long evolutionary history, evolved a wide-\nrange of extreme ecological and morphological specializations\nincluding parasitic hematophagy (Pinna &amp; Wosiacki, 2003).\n\nThe doradid genus Wertheimeria (Siluriformes:\nDoradidae), endemic to the rio Jequitinhonha basin is, in turn,\nthe sister group of the remaining doradids (Higuchi, 1992;\nPinna, 1998) and was also mentioned by Stiassny &amp; Pinna\n(1994) as a primary example of a taxon basal to a much more\ndiverse sister group. This case is herein considered another\nexample of Pattern A (Fig. 9b). Similar to the example of\ntrichomycterids, doradids underwent a long evolutionary his-\ntory in Trans/Cis-Andean South America excepting for the\nPacific Coast drainages, the Atlantic Coast south of rio de La\nPlata, and west of the rio Magdalena (Sabaj &amp; Ferraris, 2003).\nDoradids, as a consequence of their long evolutionary his-\ntory, evolved in a wide range of forms, from diminutive spe-\ncies of 3.5 cm to larger forms of about 120 cm and 20 kg (Sabaj\n&amp; Ferraris, 2003).\n\nThe conclusion taken from Pattern A is that the Brazilian\neastern coastal rivers are still inhabited by reminiscent taxa of\nan ancient biogeographic history. It is proposed herein a\nMesozoic (Cretaceous) age for the initial phase of diversifi-\ncation of an endemic ichthyofauna inhabiting the Brazilian\ncoastal rivers that still occur today.\n\nIntermediate history: Pattern B\n\nThis pattern is defined herein by sister-group relation-\nships between the endemic ichthyofauna of the Brazilian\ncoastal drainages and adjacent shield that includes interme-\ndiate degree of inclusiveness, in which, in some cases, both\n\nsister-clades underwent some subsequent radiation. The taxo-\nnomic resolution in these cases recognizes a phylogenetic\ninterrelationship at the level of genera.\n\nAn example of Pattern B is the genus Scleromystax\n(Siluriformes: Callichthyidae: Aspidoradini), with four species\nthat are endemic to the coastal drainages between the states of\nEsp\u00edrito Santo and Santa Catarina (SE and S Brazil) which is the\nsister group of the more diversified genus Aspidoras (Britto,\n2003) encompassing 18 species, widespread in both upland\nshield river and several coastal drainages (Reis, 2003) (Fig.\n10a). A relatively antiquity for Callichthyidae is also corrobo-\nrated by the fossil record. The unambiguous placement of the\nArgentinean fossil Corydoras revelatus in the Corydoradinae\nas confirmed by Britto (2003) indicates that the lineages lead-\ning to subfamily Corydoradinae occurred at least on the late\nPaleocene, as proposed by Reis (1998). Considering that\nAspidoradini and Corydoradinae are sister-groups, this mini-\nmum age can be applied to both groups.\n\nAnother example of Pattern B is the genus Lignobrycon,\nwith two known species, the extant L. myersi from rio do Bra\u00e7o\n(a coastal river of Bahia, NE Brazil) and the extinct L. ligniticus\nfrom the Trememb\u00e9 formation (Oligocene-Early Miocene, S\u00e3o\nPaulo State, SE Brazil). Lignobrycon is hypothesized to be\nthe sister group of the widespread Cis-Andean genus\nTriportheus (Malabarba, 1998) (Fig. 10b). In this example, a\nTertiary minimum age based on the fossil record can also be\ninferred for Lignobrycon, a modern endemic component of\nthe ichthyofauna of the Brazilian coastal drainages.\n\nArmored catfishes of the Rhinelepis group (Armbruster,\n1998) have similar phylogenetic and distributional patterns.\nPogonopoma wertheimeri, from the rio Mucur\u00ed and S\u00e3o\nMateus, and Pogonopoma parahybae, from the rio Para\u00edba\ndo Sul, are sister-groups. Both species are considered to be\nthe sister-group of P. obscurum, from the upper rio Uruguay\n(Quevedo &amp; Reis, 2002). The genus Pogonopoma, in turn, is\nhypothesized to be the sister group of the genus Rhinelepis\n(Armbruster, 1998; Quevedo &amp; Reis, 2002), which occurs in\nboth Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Francisco basins in the crystalline shield,\nin the coastal rio Para\u00edba do Sul, and in Northeastern Brazil,\nbut this latter occurrence was considered to be an introduc-\ntion by Armbruster (1998) (Fig. 10c). Within Trichomycteridae\nthis pattern is also recognized. The genus Microcambeva,\nwith two species, M. barbata, described from the small coastal\nrio S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and M. ribeirae\n\nFig. 8.

C. Ribeiro 237\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil238\n\n(Costa et al., 2004), from the Ribeira de Iguape, both in south-\neastern Brazil. The genus Microcambeva was hypothesized\nby Costa &amp; Bockmann (1994) to be the sister-group of a more\ninclusive clade: the monotypic genera Malacoglanis from r\u00edo\nCaquet\u00e1, Colombia plus Sarcoglanis, from the Amazonian rio\nNegro basin (Fig. 10d).\n\nSome other elements of the endemic fish fauna from the\ncoastal drainages of eastern Brazil can be also included in\nPattern B, but these groups underwent major diversification\nin coastal drainages, while their sister-groups are found in\nthe Brazilian crystalline shield and are depauperate in number\nof species. Primary examples in the Characidae are the mem-\nbers of the subfamily Glandulocaudinae, tribe\nGlandulocaudini. The species of the Mimagoniates are di-\nversified (six species) and widespread along the coastal drain-\nages, but their sister-group, the genus Glandulocauda (two\nspecies), which is primitive in several features, is endemic to\nthe crystalline shield of southeastern Brazil, from the upper\nrio Tiet\u00ea and upper rio Igua\u00e7u (Weitzman et al., 1988;\nWeitzman &amp; Menezes, 1998). The sequential sister-group to\nboth genera is the monotypic genus Lophiobrycon, which is\nalso endemic to the southeastern crystalline shield, from the\nmiddle rio Grande (Castro et al., 2003) (Fig. 10e).\n\nWeitzman &amp; Malabarba (1999), reviewing the genus\nSpintherobolus (Characiformes: Cheirodontine), comment\nthat the distribution of this genus remains something of an\nenigma. This genus, however, is a typical representative of\npattern B, with three species (S. broccae, S. leptoura, and S.\nankoseion) distributed along the coastal rivers between the\n\nBaia de Guanabara in the State of Rio de Janeiro to the north-\nern coast of the State of Santa Catarina. These species form a\nclade, which is the sister-group of S. papilliferus, known only\nfrom the headwaters of the upland rio Tiet\u00ea (Fig. 10f)\n(Weitzman &amp; Malabarba, 1998).\n\nThe degree of inclusiveness in this pattern is suggestive\nof an intermediate stage between Pattern A and the following\npattern C, related to species-level similarities between both\nareas. The occurrence, within representatives of Pattern B, of\ndated fossil species corroborate that cladogenetic event within\nthis pattern probably occurred at least by the Tertiary.\n\nThe most recent interchanges: Pattern C\n\nThis pattern reflects the most recent vicariant events be-\ntween the upland crystalline shield rivers and the adjacent\ncoastal drainages that lead to the recognition of shared spe-\ncies between than, and in some cases, of truly hybrid zones.\n\nFig. 9. Cladograms of taxa and areas showing the sister-group relationships included in Pattern A. a) Catfishes of the family\nTrichomycteridae. b) Catfishes of the family Doradidae. The degree of inclusiveness of this pattern suggests the most ancient\ncladogenetic event that is still recognized in respect to the ichthyofauna of the Brazilian coastal rivers.\n\nFig. 10.

Ribeiro 239\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil240\n\nThe frequency of shared species between the coastal\ndrainages and the upland adjacent Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Francisco\nbasins was estimated by Bizerril (1994) in 17 and 11%, respec-\ntively. Since then, revisionary papers of several groups pro-\nmote changes in these percentiles. Several species were re-\nvealed to be \u201cspecies complexes\u201d whereas others were syn-\nonymized. Examples taken from recent revisionary papers,\nhowever, illustrate Pattern C.\n\nIn southern Brazil, several species are shared between\nthe isolated coastal drainages and the adjacent upland.\nLucinda (2005), showed that Cnesterodon decemmaculatus\n(Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae: Poeciliine) is widespread\nin the lower rio Uruguay and Jacu\u00ed in the State of Rio Grande\ndo Sul, Brazil, r\u00edo Negro and Salado in Argentina as well as in\nsmall coastal drainages of Uruguay and Argentina.\nCnesterodon brevirostratus also occur in the upper rio Uru-\nguay, rio Jacu\u00ed and other coastal drainages (Lucinda, 2005).\nSimilar distributional patters in the southernmost coast of\nBrazil and neighboring areas were given by Silva (2004) who\ndescribed Bryconamericus patriciae and reported its occur-\nrence in both upper Uruguay and the coastal rio Jacu\u00ed. Reis et\nal. (1990), revising the armored catfishes of the genus\nHypostomus (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from southern Brazil\ndemonstrate the same fact: Hypostomus commersonii and H.\naspilogaster occur in rio Uruguay, rio Jacu\u00ed and other tribu-\ntaries of the coastal laguna dos Patos system.\n\nAlso in southeastern Brazil, areas can be identified in which\nPattern C occurs: 1) the upper rio Tiet\u00ea, and 2) the area includ-\ning the headwaters of the coastal rio Ribeira de Iguape and\nthe adjacent upland tributaries of the Paran\u00e1 basin, the Igua\u00e7u\nand Paranapanema rivers. However, in these cases, the shared\ncomponents are taxa, otherwise, endemic to the coastal drain-\nages, in which they are somewhat widespread. This phenom-\nenon suggests that the upper rio Tiet\u00ea suffered a posterior\ninput of an ichythyofauna once found only in coastal rivers\nwhere they were, prior to these cladogenetic events, endemic.\nLangeani (1989) for the first time identified shared species\nbetween the upper Tiet\u00ea and adjacent coastal drainages. In\nthe case of the upper rio Tiet\u00ea, the fish fauna includes several\nspecies such as Hollandichthys multifasciatus,\nPseudocorynopoma heterandria, Hyphessobrycon\nbifasciatus, Hyphessobrycon reticulatus, and Gymnotus\npantherinus (Langeani, 1989; Quevedo &amp; Reis, 2002), other-\nwise, only found in the coastal rivers. In the upper rio Igua\u00e7u,\nthis phenomenon can be also identified by the presence of\nMimagoniates microleps. This species is otherwise, found\nonly in coastal drainages and the available phylogenetic in-\nformation demonstrated that this species arose from a com-\nmon ancentor that was endemic to the coastal rivers\n(Weitzman et. al., 1988). Other typical representatives of the\nichthyofauna of the coastal drainages recently recorded in\nthe upper Igua\u00e7u are Hyphessobrycon griemi, H. bifasciatus,\nand H. reticulatus (Ingenito et al., 2004).\n\nSome other elements of the upper rio Igua\u00e7u fish fauna\nare also reported in the neighboring Ribeira de Iguape and\nParanapanema rivers, such as Trichomycterus davisi\n\n(Suluriformes: Trichomycteridae) (Ingenito et al., 2004) and\nHypostomus ancistroides (Suluriformes: Loricariidae) (Oy-\nakawa et al., 2005). Bizerrill &amp; Lima (2000) also mentioned that\nRhamdiopsis moreirai (Siluriformes: Heptapteridae) is shared\nbetween the upper Ribeira de Iguape and Igua\u00e7u.\n\nIn the northeastern margin of the Paran\u00e1 basin, adjacent\nto the upper rio S\u00e3o Francisco, Para\u00edba do Sul, and the adja-\ncent coastal drainages south of the mouth of rio Doce, some\nspecies also become widespread. This is the case of the spe-\ncies of Piabina (Characiformes: Characidae). Piabina\nargentea is widespread through the upper Paran\u00e1 basin, S\u00e3o\nFrancisco, and in some coastal rivers of the Atlantic slope:\nthe Itapicur\u00fa, Para\u00edba do Sul, and Itapemirim river basins (Vari\n&amp; Harold, 2001). Piabina is hypothesized to be the sister-\ngroup of Creagrutus, with Trans-Andean distribution. Re-\ncently, the most basal species of Creagrutus was described\nand it is endemic to the uppermost portions of the rio Paran\u00e1\nin central Brazil (Ribeiro et al., 2004). The available phyloge-\nnetic hypothesis of Piabina and Creagrutus suggests that\nthe Brazilian crystalline shield, probably the Paran\u00e1 basin, is\nthe place for the initial diversification of the group. This sug-\ngests that Piabina argentea became widespread into coastal\nrives secondarily.\n\nIn the northeastern portion of the Brazilian coast, the fau-\nnal interchange between adjacent basins was also reported,\nreflecting a mixed ichthyofauna. Rosa et al. (2004) concluded\nthat the ichthyofauna from the Caatinga semi-arid biome of\nnortheastern Brazil, encompassing portions of the S\u00e3o Fran-\ncisco, Parna\u00edba and several other adjacent coastal rivers ba-\nsins, are hybrid. These authors registered that some species\nare widespread in two or more basins encompassed by the\nCaatinga semi-arid vegetation biome. This is the case, for\nexample, of Triportheus signatus (Characiformes: Characidae),\nProchilodus brevis (Characiformes: Prochilodontidae), and\nCichlasoma orientale (Perciformes: Ciclidae) which are en-\ndemic to more than one basin encompassed by the Caatinga\nsemi-arid biome. This ichthyofauna is also composed of much\nmore widespread species, such as Parauchenipterus galeatus\n(Siluriformes: Auchenipteridae) found in all basins encom-\npassed by the Caatinga.\n\nThe concluding remarks regarding Pattern C is that the\nfaunal interchange between upland rivers and coastal drain-\nages and vice-versa occurred along the whole divergent con-\ntinental margin of Brazil. Speciation, however, was not fol-\nlowed by cladogenetic events of Pattern C, suggesting its\nrecent age relatively to the previously discussed patterns (A\nand B). The relatively recent faunal interchange between iso-\nlated hydrographic basins indicated by Pattern C needs an\nexplanative model, which will be proposed in the following\nsection.\n\nBiogeographic history\n\nSynchronization of biological and geological processes\nis a primary tenet of historical biogeography. Two approaches\nare possible for this: the study of pattern or processes in\nevolution. Herein, synchronization is hypothesized to occur\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 241\n\nbased on the \u201cPattern\u201d approach. Repetitive distributional\nand phylogenetic patterns, rather than previous knowledge\nabout speciation rates or other evolutionary processes, un-\nderpin our interpretation of the biogeographic history.\n\nThe presence, in the coastal drainages of eastern Brazil,\nof an ancient fish fauna which is the sister group of much\nmore inclusive, derived and widespread taxa (Pattern A),\nsupports the hypothesis that initial cladogenetic events\nwere related to the origin of the first drainages that flowed\ninto the Atlantic Ocean. These rivers were probably struc-\nturally oriented by megadomes, together with drainages that\nwere structurally oriented by large faults and grabens. This\nis the case with all of the Atlantic tributaries north of the\nMantiqueira-Angola and south of NE Brazil-Niger\nmegadomes, where complex fault systems were, in some\ncases, responsible for the structure of the drainage pattern\n(Saadi et al., 2002).\n\nPattern B suggests the continued faunal interchange be-\ntween the upland crystalline shield and coastal rivers through-\nout the Tertiary (Paleogene and Neogene). The continued\nerosive retreat of the eastern margin of the platform, for ex-\nample in southeastern Brazil along the margins of the Serra\ndo Mar escarpments, was responsible for transferring addi-\ntional ancestral stocks from upland to lowland river systems,\nwith such groups undergoing subsequent diversification in\nboth upland and coastal drainages. An example of this pro-\ncess was the erosive opening of the Ribeira de Iguape basin\nalong the Pre-Cambrian shear zone that governs the plan of\nthis river. These generalized erosion were concomitant to the\nreactivations of the ancient system of Pre-Cambrian and Me-\nsozoic rifts present along the whole tectonic active Brazilian\ncontinental margin.\n\nVertical movements between large rifted blocks resulting\nfrom such reactivations were also of great importance in the\n\nFig. 11. (a) The main axes of Quaternary tectonics in Brazil (gray lines) (according to Saadi, 1993) and areas of coincident\ndistributional rages of several species in both isolated coastal rivers and adjacent drainages. (b) The northeastern margin of\nBrazil, including the Parna\u00edba, S\u00e3o Francisco and adjacent coastal rivers (c) The Southern most Brazil, encompassing the\nUruguay and surroundings coastal rivers as well as the headwaters of the Paranapanema, Iva\u00ed, Iguac\u00fa and Ribeira de Iguape.\n(d) The area encompassed by the CRSB, in southeastern Brazil, including the coastal rivers and the adjacent upper Tiet\u00ea and\nupper Igua\u00e7u.\n\n\n\nTectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil242\n\ndevelopment of the present distribution patterns of the fish\nfauna, which is especially evident in the rifted margin of south-\neastern Brazil. The Taubat\u00e9 basin clearly exemplifies how the\ncapture of hydrographic systems by large grabens, captur-\ning not only headwaters but also larger rivers from adjacent\nupland areas, is a significant factor in determining the distri-\nbution patterns of the aquatic biota. The fossil fish fauna of\nthe Trememb\u00e9 Formation contains representatives of the sur-\nrounding basins, including some fishes typical of large rivers\nsuch as the siluriform Steindachneridion (also found in the\nJequitinhonha, Doce, Para\u00edba do Sul and upper Uruguay river\nsystems), and exemplifies the degree of faunal exchange that\nresulted from such tectonic phenomena. Unfortunately, the\nTaubat\u00e9 basin is the only basin of the taphrogenic system\nencompassed by the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil\nthat is known to contain fossil fishes.\n\nThe geological mechanisms associated with Pattern C\ntakes us to the fascinating paradigms associated to the con-\ncepts of Neotectonics. According to recent models, the wide-\nspread system of rifts and other crustal discontinuities present\nalong the Atlantic divergent margin of South America act as\nweakness zones more prone to tectonic activity and deforma-\ntions (Saadi, 1993; Saadi et al., 2002). Several hydrological\nanomalies are symptomatic of active tectonics (Moores &amp;\nTwiss, 2000), along which, for our aims, the most important\nare stream captures (Cobbold et al., 2001). Stream capture or\npiracy can operate basically in two different ways in tectonic\nactive areas. It can be a direct effect of tectonic stress, when\nthe streams suffer an abrupt deviation as a consequence of\nthe relative movement between rifted blocks. Alternatively, it\noccurs by differential erosion, because deformation in the\nlandscape promote the adjustment of the drainage to new\nbase level, causing streams on lowered blocks, with a steeper\ngradient and, consequently more energy, to extends its val-\nley headward due to erosion, eventually breaking down the\ndivide and capturing part or all of the drainage of adjacent\nslower streams (Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens, 2002). The continuity of\nthese processes was probably the cause of an intense faunal\ninput from the crystalline shield fauna into the coastal rivers\nalong the Tertiary and afterwards, as exemplified by Patterns\nB and C.\n\nWith no exceptions, the above mentioned areas in which\nPattern C occurs have been identified as active tectonic ar-\neas, some of these with proven activity younger than 1.6 Ma\n(Saadi et al., 2002) (Fig. 11). This is especially true for, at least,\ntwo areas on the upland crystalline shield of southeastern\nBrazil, which share a mixed fish fauna with the lowland coastal\ndrainages. These are: 1) the area including the headwaters of\nthe rio Ribeira de Iguape, Igua\u00e7u and Paranapanema rivers,\nand 2) the upper portion of the rio Tiet\u00ea. Not surprisingly,\nthese regions correspond to areas with interesting geologi-\ncal characteristics. In both cases, a complex system of fault\nlineaments and rifted blocks imposed an especially acceler-\nated fluvial dynamism.\n\nIn the region of Paranapanema, Igua\u00e7\u00fa and Ribeira de\nIguape headwaters, the most prominent geological feature is\n\nthe Ponta Grossa Arch. The arch consists of an uplift of the\ncrystalline basement along the southeastern portion of the\nParan\u00e1 Basin (Petri &amp; Fulfaro, 1983). The Ponta Grossa Arch\nis easily visible on geological maps due to the westward cur-\nvature of the southeastern Paran\u00e1 Basin (Raposo, 1995) dis-\nplaying an intricate systems of deep faults and fractures. The\nmain faults of the Ponta Grossa Arch are those present in the\nGuapiara, S\u00e3o Jer\u00f4nimo-Curi\u00fava and Rio Alonzo structural\nfault lineaments (Raposo, 1995). This fault system was sup-\nposed to be the main conduit of the immense Cretaceous flow\nof lava over the Paran\u00e1 Basin know as Serra Geral Formation,\nwhich left a large system of dykes of intrusive magma showed\nin Fig. 6a. Some authors have pointed out that the Ponta\nGrossa Arch has a general tendency to uplift (Almeida &amp;\nCarneiro, 1998) and underwent tectonic activity during the\nCenozoic (Almeida &amp; Carneiro, 1998; Souza &amp; Souza, 2002).\nThe tectonic activity of the Ponta Grossa Arch could have\nresulted in a particularly accelerated fluvial dynamism between\nadjacent drainage systems, accelerating the faunal exchange\nbetween them. In the Ponta Grossa Arch, faults control the\nrelief and the drainage patterns (Melo, 2002). Vertical move-\nments between faulted blocks and erosive evolution of rivers\nalong such rifts promote mixing between adjacent drainages,\nand likely explain the faunal exchanges that occurred between\nthe coastal Ribeira de Iguape, and the uplands Igua\u00e7u and\nParanapanema rivers.\n\nSimilar process might have occurred in the upper Tiet\u00ea. In\nits upper portion, this river drains the S\u00e3o Paulo Basin, which\nwas, apparently, an extension of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin during the\ninitial phase of the taphrogenic event that originated both\nbasins (Ab\u2019S\u00e1ber, 1998; Riccomini, 1989; Riccomini et al., 2004).\nDisconnection of these basins was caused by subsequent\ntectonic event in the tectonic history of the CRSB. The same\ntectonic uplift could be responsible for sending back to the\nupper Paran\u00e1 Basin an aquatic biota that was once associ-\nated to lowland costal drainages during an intermediate tec-\ntonic and erosive phase. In fact, the idea that southeastern\nBrazil is a tectonically active area and prone to undergo de-\nformations (Cobbold et al., 2001) is strongly supported by\nthese complex distributional patterns included in Pattern C.\nThe intense tectonic activity along the CRSB also explain\nwhy the Paran\u00e1 basin contributed more (in terms of ancestral\nstocks) to the development of the coastal drainages fish fauna,\nas mentioned by Bizerril (1994).\n\nThe same is true for the northeastern Brazil, in the\nBorborema Province. That region is extensively transected\nby such kind of structural discontinuities: Pre-Cambrian rifts\nand shear zones as well as several branches of oceanic rift\nzones that extends over the northeastern margin of the conti-\nnent and are all prone do undergo deformations (Saadi, 1993)\n(Fig. 11). The neotectonic behavior of the Borborema Prov-\nince should result in an accelerated fluvial dynamism between\nadjacent drainages resulting in extensive faunal interchange.\nThe identification of such phenomenon in this region made\nby Brito Neves et al. (2004) that resulted in the deviation of\nthe rio Para\u00edba in the Tertiary corroborates this idea.\n\n\n\nA. C. Ribeiro 243\n\nThe tectonic control over the distributional pattern of the\nichthyofauna from the coastal drainages and adjacent up-\nland rivers seems to be the rule. A more detailed view of this\nprocess that will probably occur in the future should confirm\nthis idea and provide more detailed causal explanations for\nother areas that become not exemplified or discussed herein.\nIt is intriguing that Pattern C is recurrent along the whole area\nencompassed by the rifted eastern continental margin of South\nAmerica, suggesting a high degree of faunal interchange be-\ntween adjacent basins.\n\nThe mixed nature of hydrografic basins was already no-\nticed by Costa (2001) who proposed that headwaters are typi-\ncally areas of complex faunal interchange between adjacent\nregions rather than repeating components of the faunal stocks\nof a major unit represented by the basin as a whole, but no\nexplanatory model was provide for that fact. Figure 11a shows\nthat the same kind of structural discontinuities found along\nthe eastern margin of Brazil have a much more including ex-\ntension. The same tectonic mechanisms allowing interchanges\nbetween the Brazilian coastal rivers with neighboring drain-\nages probably also took place between basins located into\nthe continent interior at the crystalline shield. These inter-\nchanges caused by stream captures were supposedly to oc-\ncur where divides are transected by crustal discontinuities,\nsuch as Pre-Cambrian rifted and shear zones or extensions of\nthe oceanic rifted zones over the continents (Saadi, 1993).\n\nThe above arguments run counter to theories that pro-\npose that diversification of the fish fauna of the coastal drain-\nages of South America was exclusively related to sea level\nchanges during the Late Pleistocene (Weitzman et al., 1988).\nThat model hypothesized that, when the sea level was about\n100 m lower than today, the fish fauna was able to become\nmore widespread. Following a rise in sea level, speciation\noccurred within isolated river basins. This model, however,\ndoes not explain the mechanism by which species from coastal\nrivers, supposedly originated during the late Pleistocene,\ncould occur secondarily in upland rivers, such as the upper\nTiet\u00ea and Igua\u00e7u. The erosive retreat of the eastern margin of\nsoutheastern Brazil can continuously introduce ancestral\nstocks from upland rivers into coastal drainages, but not in\nthe opposite way. Only significant tectonic deformations are\nable to send back to the upland, species typical to coastal\nrivers found in the upper portion of the Tiet\u00ea and Igua\u00e7u\nbasins. If the explanation of pattern C is associated with tec-\ntonic relationships, than the fish fauna involved had to have\nevolved prior to the sea level changes of the Late Pleistocene,\na period when the South American Platform underwent no\nexpressive vertical movements between faulted blocks and\nthe present shape of the eastern continental margin was es-\ntablished. The sea level changes of the Late Pleistocene can\nexplain the widespread distributional ranges of several taxa\nonly along the coastal drainages, but fails to explain the oc-\ncurrence in upland basins of some species that arose from a\ncommon ancestor that was endemic to the lowland coastal\nrivers. The major tectonic influence on distribution patterns\nand cladogenetic events between the eastern coastal drain-\n\nages and the upland crystalline shield predicts that they took\nplace during a much longer period of time, from the end of the\nCretaceous to the early Quaternary.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis paper was greatly improved by the suggestions, criti-\ncisms and detailed review of Richard Vari (NMNH, Smithso-\nnian Institution), Marcelo Carvalho (FFCLRP-USP) and\nClaudio Riccomini (IG-USP).
