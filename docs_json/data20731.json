Antes de mais, como a minha mem\u00f3ria j\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 o que \n\nera (por sua vez, gra\u00e7as, em parte, a este trabalho), faltar\u00e3o pessoas. Se aqui n\u00e3o est\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 por mal. \n\nDiria para me virem cravar um copo, que vontade n\u00e3o falta. Mas falta dinheiro, portanto fica para a \n\npr\u00f3xima. \n\nUm especial agradecimento ao coordenador deste mestrado, Professor Ant\u00f3nio Mateus, por todo \n\no apoio prestado e paci\u00eancia consumida, mas tamb\u00e9m pela preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e a disponibilidade que \n\ndemonstrou, recorrentemente, no esclarecimento de d\u00favidas. Ao orientador Jorge Figueiras, pela leitura \n\natenta, pelas correc\u00e7\u00f5es e sugest\u00f5es, que permitiram melhorar substancialmente o documento final. \u00c0 \n\ncoorientadora deste trabalho, Ana Jesus, por todas as reuni\u00f5es por Skype, pelas discuss\u00f5es, sugest\u00f5es e \n\ncorrec\u00e7\u00f5es que beneficiaram este trabalho. Devo-lhe ainda um agradecimento especial e pessoal, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \n\npor toda a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, incentivo e amizade, mas tamb\u00e9m por me ter recebido de bra\u00e7os abertos em sua \n\ncasa, a 8500km da minha, como se fosse apenas um reencontro de velhos (n\u00e3o etariamente) amigos, \n\napesar de nos termos acabado de conhecer. Obrigado por teres tornado a estadia no inferno (aquilo \u00e9 \n\nquente!) muito mais agrad\u00e1vel. Quero ainda agradecer \u00e0 Professora Isabel Costa e ao ao Professor Pedro \n\nMadureira, pelas preciosas correc\u00e7\u00f5es, sugest\u00f5es e reparos, muit\u00edssimo \u00fateis na redac\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\ndocumento final substancialmente melhor que o provis\u00f3rio. Gostaria tamb\u00e9m de agradecer a todas as \n\npessoas que tornaram os meus dias na GUTech/Om\u00e3 mais f\u00e1ceis; um especial agradecimento \u00e0 C\u00e9line \n\nDucassou, ao Wilfried Bauer, ao Bernhard Pracejus e \u00e0 Amal. \u00c0 Universidade de Aveiro, na pessoa do \n\nProfessor Fernando Rocha e de Maria Cristina Sequeira, pelo fornecimento de parte dos dados de \n\nlitogeoqu\u00edmica. Ao Mathieu Bennoit, pela outra metade dos dados de geoqu\u00edmica de rocha total, os \n\nelementos tra\u00e7o, e pelas discuss\u00f5es relativas ao contexto geol\u00f3gico/geodin\u00e2mico. Ao Dr. Pedro \n\nRodrigues, pelos dados de microssonda e tamb\u00e9m por toda a simpatia e paci\u00eancia a responder \u00e0s minhas \n\nquest\u00f5es existenciais relativas \u00e0 qu\u00edmica mineral. E por me mostrar que sou um nabo a fazer contas. \n\nAos meus amigos, da universidade e n\u00e3o s\u00f3, devo tamb\u00e9m umas palavrinhas: \n\n\u00c0 Sofia, pelo enorme apoio e amizade, por ter sido (quase) minha m\u00e3e (tamb\u00e9m quem cria dois, \n\ncria dois e meio), por todo o gas\u00f3leo gasto a fazer um desvio, \u00e0 noite, quando podia estar a fazer o o-\u00f3, \n\ndo qual se auto-intitula profissional. Pela companhia a horas obscenas na faculdade, que tornou o \n\ntrabalho p\u00f3s-luz solar muito mais toler\u00e1vel e tamb\u00e9m pelas incr\u00edveis pausas, a melhor parte das noitadas \n\nsem fim. Al\u00e9m disso, devo-lhe tamb\u00e9m um agradecimento especial por ter sido fundamental para \n\nmanter, pelo menos, parte da minha sanidade mental; obrigado pelo enorme apoio e por me ter aturado \n\ntanto tempo. Vamos \u00e0 pausa! \u00c0 Cristiana, por me ter deixado ocupar o sof\u00e1 da sua casa algumas vezes, \n\npela amizade e apoio constantes, pela motiva\u00e7\u00e3o, assim como pelos j\u00e1, internacionalmente, conhecidos \n\nbolos e doces, que fazem as delicias da malta do 4\u00ba piso do C6. \u00c0 Rita (Ferraz), pela contagiante boa \n\ndisposi\u00e7\u00e3o, pela simpatia e motiva\u00e7\u00e3o, pela ajuda e por me ter deixado, tantas vezes, invadir a sua casa \n\ne ocupar o sof\u00e1. Ao Bruno, por me ter aturado tr\u00eas meses em Om\u00e3 sem ter cometido \n\nhomic\u00eddio\u2026oportunidades n\u00e3o faltaram. \u00c0 chefa Filipa, pela ajuda essencial no processamento \n\nlaboratorial das amostras, pela motiva\u00e7\u00e3o, incentivo e pux\u00f5es de orelhas (\u00e0s vezes tem de ser!). Ao \n\nFilipe, pela preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, incentivo e amizade (j\u00e1 l\u00e1 v\u00e3o 6 anos!), e por ser uma excelente pessoa e um \n\nexemplo, a n\u00edvel pessoal e cient\u00edfico; ao Ivo, pela boa disposi\u00e7\u00e3o, apoio, motiva\u00e7\u00e3o e toda a amizade, \n\ntamb\u00e9m j\u00e1 longa; ao Z\u00e9, pelas pausas, \u201creuni\u00f5es importantes\u201d e pela companhia durante as noites \n\nintermin\u00e1veis na faculdade. Ao Marcelo e aos restantes amigos deste mestrado com quem passei \n\nmomentos inesquec\u00edveis, Fred, Miguel, Velez e Hugo. Ao Soares, por todas as palavras de carinho e \n\namizade e pela constante preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o; \u00e0 Joana Duarte, pelas palavras de apoio, motiva\u00e7\u00e3o e por todos \n\nos chocolates deliciosos que trouxe da Su\u00ed\u00e7a. Ao Pambu, pela preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e por, apesar de toda a \n\ndist\u00e2ncia e tempo, continuar a ser o mesmo palha\u00e7o que ia comigo buscar chocolate e p\u00e3o ao LIDL (bons \n\ntempos). \u00c0 Maja que, apesar de ter tido uma estadia curta em Portugal, se tornou uma \u00f3tima companheira \n\nde trabalho e dos momentos de pausa, para beber uma cerveja e falar das banalidades da vida (em ingl\u00eas \n\n\n\n \n \n\nIV \n\nclaro); agrade\u00e7o-lhe tamb\u00e9m a amizade e todas as palavras de apoio e motiva\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao \u201ccamarada\u201d \n\nManuel Silva, por todas as discuss\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas nas pausas para caf\u00e9. Um agradecimento especial \n\ntamb\u00e9m \u00e0 Rita (Pereira), Marcelino, Miguel Teixeira, Ana Medeiros, Ana Jacinto, Vanessa Pais e Joana \n\nFerreira, pela amizade e pela forma desinteressada com que me apoiaram ao longo deste(s) ano(s). \n\nDepois de toda esta lamechice, vem outra, que deixo o melhor para o fim. Gostaria de agradecer \n\nde forma muito especial aos meus pais, ao Jo\u00e3o e \u00e0s minhas av\u00f3s, que sempre me possibilitaram e \n\nincentivaram, sem restri\u00e7\u00f5es, a seguir os estudos em algo que, pelo menos ao in\u00edcio, n\u00e3o faziam ideia \n\ndo que era (caramba, s\u00e3o s\u00f3 pedras!) \u2013 nem eu, passados seis anos, fa\u00e7o! Devo-lhes tamb\u00e9m um pedido \n\nde desculpas, por todas as aus\u00eancias. Obrigado pela enorme compreens\u00e3o e pelo constante apoio. \n\nPor fim, quero agradecer \u00e0 pessoa a quem dedico este trabalho, que sempre me dirigiu palavras \n\nde motiva\u00e7\u00e3o, carinho, apre\u00e7o e apoio e, infelizmente, n\u00e3o o p\u00f4de ver terminado. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nV \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nSince this part is almost mandatory (and let\u2019s be honest, no one reads any other chapters besides \n\nthe abstracts and the acknowledgements), here is the list of people who contributed, in many ways, for \n\nthis work to be completed. First of all, since my memory isn\u2019t what is used to be (partly due to this \n\nwork), some people are probably missing. It\u2019s not in bad faith. I\u2019d say to come and ask me for a drink, \n\nI\u2019ve got the will. But not the money, so we\u2019ll schedule it for another day. \n\nI am forever in debt to the MSc program coordinator, Professor Ant\u00f3nio Mateus, for all the \n\nsupport and patience but also for all the concern and availability in answering questions he has shown. \n\nTo this work supervisor, Jorge Figueiras, whose careful reading allowed to substantially improve the \n\npresented work. To the co-supervisor, Ana Jesus, for all the Skype meetings, discussions, suggestions \n\nand corrections, especially regarding my English skills, which were also important to this thesis. I owe \n\nher, also, many thanks, personally, not only for the concern, incentive and friendship, but also for \n\nwelcoming me so warmly at her place, 8500km from mine, as if it was only an old friends reencounter, \n\ndespite the fact we had just met each other. Thank you for making the stay in hell (that place is warm!) \n\nso much enjoyable. Also, many thanks to Professors Isabel Costa and Pedro Madureira, for the time and \n\npatience spent, reading this work, and for the precious and important corrections and suggestions, \n\nimproving this final version I\u2019d also like to thank to everyone that made my days in GUtech/Oman \n\neasier: special mentions to C\u00e9line Ducassou, to Wilfried Bauer, to Amal, to Bernhard Pracejus and to \n\nMichaela Bernecker. To the University of Aveiro, namely Professor Fernando Rocha and Maria Cristina \n\nSequeira, for providing part of the lithogeochemical data. To Mathieu Bennoit, for the other part of the \n\nwhole-rock trace element geochemical data as well as for the discussions related to the geodynamic and \n\ngeological setting of the ophiolite. To Dr. Pedro Rodrigues, for the microprobe data, as well as for his \n\nkindness and patience in answering all my existential question regarding mineral chemistry. And also \n\nfor showing me that I\u2019m a complete zero at math. \n\nI\u2019d also want to mention some of my friends.  \n\nTo Sofia, for the support and friendship. For being (almost) my mother (she raised two so, two \n\nand a half is not a problem), for all the gasoline spent in a small detour at night, when she could have \n\nbeen sleeping, which she brags about being a professional at it. For the company at obscene hours in the \n\nuniversity, making the post-daylight work more bearable, as well as for the amazing breaks, the best \n\ntime of those endless nights. Furthermore, I owe her also some special thanks for being fundamental for \n\nme to keep, at least part, of my mental health. Come, it\u2019s break time! To Cristiana, for sometimes letting \n\nme occupy her sofa, for the constant friendship and support, motivation and the, by now internationally \n\nknown, cakes and sweets, that delights everyone on the 4\nth\n floor of C6. To Rita (Ferraz), with her \n\nconstant and contagious good humour, for the kindness and motivational conversations, for the help she \n\ngave me and for often letting me invade her place and crash in. To Bruno, for putting up with me for \n\nthree months without committing murder\u2026There were a lot of opportunities. To the boss, Filipa, for the \n\nessential help in the laboratorial processing of the samples, for the motivational words and the occasional \n\nearful. To Filipe, for the constant concern, motivation and friendship (6 years already!). For being a \n\nterrific person and a great example, personally and scientifically; to Ivo, for the great and fun mood, \n\nsupport and motivation, as well as for the now long (and good) friendship; to Z\u00e9, for the breaks from \n\nwork, \u201cimportant meetings\u201d and for the companionship throughout the nights in FCUL; to Marcelo and \n\nthe rest of my friends from the MSc, with which I spent unforgettable moments, Fred, Miguel, Velez \n\nand Hugo. To Soares, for all the kind words and for being a great friend; to Joana Duarte, for all the \n\ninspiring words and for all the delicious chocolates brought from Switzerland. To Pambu, for the interest \n\nand, despite the distance, remaining the same asshole that kept me company at night in FCUL, after \n\ngrabbing some bread and chocolate from LIDL (good old times). To Maja which, despite the short stay \n\nin Portugal, became a pleasant company, during work-time and afterwards: to grab a beer and talk about \n\nthe trivialities of life; I also want to thank her for all the support and motivation, even when she left \n\nLisbon. To my \u201ccomrade\u201d Manuel Silva, for all the geological discussions and the coffee-break \n\nenjoyable times. I\u2019d also like to give out special thanks to Rita (Pereira), Marcelino, Miguel Teixeira, \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVI \n\nAna Medeiros, Ana Jacinto, Vanessa Pais and Joana Ferreira, for the friendship and support during \n\nthis/these year(s). \n\nAfter all this lame conversation, here it comes: another one. I saved the best for last. I\u2019d like to \n\nappreciate and acknowledge, in a very special way, both my parents, my brother Jo\u00e3o and my \n\ngrandmothers, who\u2019ve always supported and encouraged me, without restraints, to follow what I thought \n\nbest, despite, at first, they didn\u2019t have any clue of what was it all about (damn, it\u2019s just rocks!)- neither \n\ndo I, and six years have passed already! I owe them, also, a great deal of apologies, for all my absences. \n\nThanks for the huge understanding and support. \n\nFinally, I also want to thank in a very special way to the person I dedicate this work, which \n\nunconditionally supported me and showed a great deal of appreciation and care; which motivated me to \n\nkeep studying and, sadly, couldn\u2019t see this \u201cchapter\u201d completed. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVII \n\nRESUMO  \n\nDurante o Cret\u00e1cico, o complexo contexto geol\u00f3gico e geodin\u00e2mico do ofiolito de Sumail, situado no \n\nOm\u00e3, permitiu o desenvolvimento de sistemas hidrotermais e consequente forma\u00e7\u00e3o de numerosas \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfuretos maci\u00e7os, algumas com interesse econ\u00f3mico, encontrando-se hospedadas \n\nna sequ\u00eancia vulc\u00e2nica. Esta \u00e9 dividida em quatro principais unidades vulc\u00e2nicas (da mais antiga para a \n\nmais recente): Geotimes, Lasail, Alley e Boninitic Alley. Apesar da maior parte destes dep\u00f3sitos se \n\nencontrarem hospedados na transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre Geotimes e Alley, qualquer per\u00edodo de quiesc\u00eancia \n\nvulc\u00e2nica, muitas vezes marcados pela presen\u00e7a de sedimentos metal\u00edferos e outros marcadores de \n\nactividade hidrotermal exalativa, traduz um horizonte temporal onde a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nsulfuretos maci\u00e7os \u00e9 poss\u00edvel. Esta prov\u00edncia metalog\u00e9netica de VMS do tipo m\u00e1fico/tipo Chipre, \u00e9, \n\nent\u00e3o, compar\u00e1vel, em dimens\u00e3o e tonelagem, ao ofiolito de Troodos, Chipre, com 30 a 50Mt de \n\ntonelagem total de min\u00e9rios. \n\nO dep\u00f3sito de Mandoos, situado perto de Sohar, na parte Norte do ofiolito de Sumail, foi descoberto em \n\n2009 atrav\u00e9s de t\u00e9cnicas geof\u00edsicas aeroportadas (VTEM), e as opera\u00e7\u00f5es de extra\u00e7\u00e3o tiveram in\u00edcio em \n\n2011, em open-pit. Com recursos medidos que perfazem um total de 8 Mt, com 5 Mt de reservas (a 1.8% \n\nde Cu), este dep\u00f3sito representa um dos maiores dep\u00f3sitos descobertos neste ofiolito. Apesar disto, a \n\ninexist\u00eancia de estudos detalhados desta mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, fazem dele um \u00f3timo caso de estudo, permitindo \n\no desenvolvimento de um estudo metalogen\u00e9tico aprofundado, (possivelmente) contribuindo para a \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o de crit\u00e9rios de prospe\u00e7\u00e3o deste tipo de mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es. Assim, recorrendo a amostras recolhdas \n\nno open-pit e em sondagens cedidas pela Mawarid Mining, este trabalho teve como objectivo a \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da sequ\u00eancia vulc\u00e2nica que hospeda esta mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, utilizando crit\u00e9rios \n\nmineral\u00f3gicos e geoqu\u00edmicos, com objectivo de I) atribuir uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o volcano-estratigr\u00e1fica ao \n\ndep\u00f3sito, e II) caracterizar os padr\u00f5es de altera\u00e7\u00e3o observados, distinguindo entre halos de altera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nimput\u00e1veis a epis\u00f3dios regionais, de baixa temperatura (\u201cmetassomatismo oce\u00e2nico\u201d) e halos de \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal, associados \u00e0 precipita\u00e7\u00e3o e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfuretos maci\u00e7os. \n\nAs rochas vulc\u00e2nicas que hospedam esta mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o correspondem a rochas bas\u00e1lticas, de natureza \n\ntoleiitica, caracterizadas por anomalias positivas, baixas, em Ti. Os teores baixos em ETRL (comparados \n\ncom os dos ETRP), os padr\u00f5es normalizados (condrito C1) de ETR e os seus teores em HSFE permitem \n\natribuir estas rochas \u00e0 unidade Lasail, colocando a possibilidade das rochas vulc\u00e2nicas a muro da \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o corresponderem a vulcanismo transicional entre esta unidade e a Geotimes. Considerando \n\nas caracter\u00edsticas geoqu\u00edmicas, particularmente de elementos tra\u00e7o e, tamb\u00e9m, os dados publicados (e.g. \n\nGodard et al., 2003; 2006; Kusano et al., 2012) para esta unidade vulc\u00e2nica, considera-se que estas \n\nderivam da fus\u00e3o parcial de rochas mant\u00e9licas, sujeitas anteriormente a taxas de fus\u00e3o parcial elevadas, \n\naquando da forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fundidos silicatados m\u00e1ficos, tipo MORB, cuja extrus\u00e3o originou a unidade \n\ninfrajacente, Geotimes, num contexto de rift e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de crosta oce\u00e2nica.  \n\nA sequ\u00eancia vulc\u00e2nica \u00e9 composta por basaltos microporfir\u00edticos, sob a forma de escoadas maci\u00e7as e/ou \n\npillow-lavas, com quantidades e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de ves\u00edculas vari\u00e1veis, traduzindo os canais por onde os \n\ngases escaparam, durante a sua extrus\u00e3o. Estas encontram-se tamb\u00e9m localmente fragmentadas, sendo \n\nesta fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o resultante de processos de arrefecimento brusco, relacionados com a interac\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\n\u00e1gua do mar. Estes processos est\u00e3o associados a fractura\u00e7\u00e3o e fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o, criando descont\u00ednuidades \n\nf\u00edsicas que permitem o escoamento de fluidos, gerando texturas similares a brechas. Os \n\nmicrofenocristais de clinopiroxena, de composi\u00e7\u00e3o aug\u00edtica, e de feldspatos do grupo das plagioclases, \n\nde composi\u00e7\u00e3o bytown\u00edtica, encontram-se dispersos, por vezes em aglomerados, numa matriz composta \n\npor micr\u00f3litos de feldspatos do grupo das plagioclases, de composi\u00e7\u00e3o semelhante \u00e0 dos \n\nmicrofenocristais, e \u00f3xidos de Fe com quantidades consider\u00e1veis de Ti.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVIII \n\nUm primeiro epis\u00f3dio de altera\u00e7\u00e3o, de natureza pervasiva e ub\u00edquo, correspondente a altera\u00e7\u00e3o regional \n\ndecorrente da circula\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua do mar, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es oxidantes, emm raz\u00f5es \u00e1gua/rocha baixas \n\n(metassomatismo oce\u00e2nico), processo comumente apelidado de espilitiza\u00e7\u00e3o. Este est\u00e1dio de altera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00e9 marcado pela altera\u00e7\u00e3o das fases vulc\u00e2nicas prim\u00e1rias: no caso dos cristais de clinopiroxena, esta \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o d\u00e1-se preferencialmente nos bordos e em fracturas, e esta \u00e9 materializada por anf\u00edbola e, \n\nposteriormente, marcada por clorite+ep\u00eddoto; por sua vez, os microfenocristais e micr\u00f3litos de \n\nplagioclase registam um incremento significativo da mol\u00e9cula alb\u00edtica na sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo apenas \n\nencontrados n\u00facleos que preservam a composi\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria; os \u00f3xidos de ferro disseminados na matriz \n\napresentam, frequentemente, bordos corro\u00eddos, e, na proximidade destes, s\u00e3o encontrados cristais de \n\ntitanite. A matriz destas rochas encontra-se substitu\u00edda por filossilicatos, com caracter\u00edsticas expansivas, \n\npossivelmente interestratificados clorite-esmectite. A presen\u00e7a destes interestratificados poder\u00e1 resultar, \n\nassim, da altera\u00e7\u00e3o de vidro vulc\u00e2nico. Este epis\u00f3dio \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m caracterizado pelo preenchimento das \n\nves\u00edculas por fases minerais neo-formadas, como \u00e9 o caso dos interestratificados clorite-smectite, calcite \n\ne ze\u00f3litos c\u00e1lcicos. Estas ocorrem frequentemente, tamb\u00e9m, sob a forma de precipitados que preenchem \n\nveios. Frequentemente, s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m encontrados veios preenchidos por hematite+carbonatos+clorite, \n\nque marcam a transi\u00e7\u00e3o para o segundo epis\u00f3dio de altera\u00e7\u00e3o identificado.  \n\nNa zona SE do dep\u00f3sito, assim como no open pit, s\u00e3o encontrados jaspes e umbers \u2013 rochas argil\u00edticas \n\nricas em (hidr)\u00f3xidos de Fe e Mn-, resultado de actividade exalativa hidrotermal de baixa tempertura. O \n\ndesenvolvimento deste sistema hidrotermal est\u00e1, possivelmente, controlado estruturalmente, e, perto do \n\ncontacto com estas rochas exalativo-hidrotermais, observa-se, na matriz das rochas vulc\u00e2nicas, uma \n\nforte impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de hematite, sendo apenas reconhec\u00edvel alguns fenocristais de clinopiroxena. Na \n\nrestante \u00e1rea, longe da influ\u00eancia directa das estruturas por onde os fluidos hidrotermais oxidantes, ricos \n\nem Fe e Mn, circulam, este epis\u00f3dio est\u00e1 marcado pela presen\u00e7a de veios de hematite+quartzo. S\u00e3o, \n\ntamb\u00e9m, frequentemente, observados veios de carbonatos calc\u00edticos, que cortam estas rochas exalativas, \n\nlocalmente preenchendo fracturas en echelon, com brechifica\u00e7\u00e3o sobreimposta. \n\nA actividade hidrotermal relacionada com a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfuretos maci\u00e7os (e a intensidade da \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o associada) \u00e9, tamb\u00e9m, controlada estruturalmente, mas tamb\u00e9m fun\u00e7\u00e3o da porosidade e \n\npermeabilidade das rochas vulc\u00e2nicas, i.e. abund\u00e2ncia e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das ves\u00edculas. Com base em \n\ngeoterm\u00f3metros baseados na variabilidade composicional da clorite, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel estimar temperaturas \n\nentre 250-400\u00baC, para o fluido hidrotermal relacionado com a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nDe forma geral, distinguem-se diferentes fases de circula\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos hidrotermais, dispostos numa \n\nrede de veios e filonetes, preenchidos por: I) Qz+Py+Chl; II) Qz+Py+Ccp; III) Cb+Py/Qz+Zeol; IV e \n\nV) Qz microcristalino. O controlo estrutural para a circula\u00e7\u00e3o destes fluidos hidrotermais \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m \n\nreconhec\u00edvel atrav\u00e9s das evid\u00eancias de reabertura e sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o destas est\u00e1dios de precipitados \n\nhidrotermais. A acompanhar a altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal associada \u00e0 mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, ocorrem espor\u00e1dicas \n\ndissemina\u00e7\u00f5es de cristais eu\u00e9dricos, sub-microsc\u00f3picos, de apatite, sugerindo uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfluidos magm\u00e1tico-derivados, associados \u00e0 cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das intrus\u00f5es sub-vulc\u00e2nicas doler\u00edticas. Estas \n\nrochas apresentam tamb\u00e9m dissemina\u00e7\u00f5es de apatite, assim como alguns sulfuretos (sub)microsc\u00f3picos. \n\nNa \u00e1rea S/SE da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, a altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal est\u00e1 marcada por uma silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o fraca, \n\ndissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de pirite e processos mais intensos de cloritiza\u00e7\u00e3o (comparando com as amostras \n\nrecuperadas no open pit), com veios de quarto, clorite, pirite e, ocasionalmente, calcopirite. A partir dos \n\ndados de quimica mineral de gr\u00e3os de chlorite, obtidos a partir destas amostras, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel concluir que \n\no fluido hidrotermal mineralizante, circulou a temperaturas entre os 200-400\u00baC, com valor mediano de \n\n~270\u00baC. Por sua vez, nas amostras provenientes do open-pit s\u00e3o observ\u00e1veis processos altera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhidrotermal marcados por silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o mais intensos, acompanhados pela deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de clorite, sob a \n\n\n\n \n \n\nIX \n\nforma de agregados de granularidade reduzida, dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de pirite, e ocasionalmente de calcopirite \n\ne esfalerite. Em ambos os casos \u00e9 possivel encontrar, por vezes, evid\u00eancias mineral\u00f3gicas atribu\u00edveis ao \n\nprimeiro est\u00e1dio de altera\u00e7\u00e3o descrito (metassomatismo oce\u00e2nico), nomeadamente micr\u00f3litos de \n\nplagioclase albitizados.  \n\nDurante a altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal, os balan\u00e7os de massa que se estabelecem s\u00e3o, geralmente, negativos, \n\ncom perdas de massa significativas, caracterizados por perda consider\u00e1vel em Si, Ca ou Mg, compat\u00edvel \n\ncom a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o das fases ferromagnesianas prim\u00e1rias e neo-forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fases secund\u00e1rias. Ganhos \n\nem Fe, acompanhados por Mg, indicam a presen\u00e7a de fluidos hidrotermais dilu\u00eddos (misturados com \n\n\u00e1gua do mar), enquanto algumas zonas do open-pit s\u00e3o caracterizadas por ganhos em Fe, n\u00e3o \n\nacompanhados por ganhos em Mg, sugerindo a circula\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos hidrotermais n\u00e3o dilu\u00eddos. A estes \n\ndom\u00ednios, registam tamb\u00e9m ganhos consider\u00e1veis em Cu, Zn, As, Ba e ainda em In, Sn, Tl e Cd, na \n\nordem das dezenas de ppm, indicando ainda um input de fluidos tardios de oridem magm\u00e1tica, para o \n\nfluido hidrotermal, respons\u00e1vel pela mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\u00c9 tamb\u00e9m poss\u00edvel observar veios de hematite, posteriores \u00e0 altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal, revelando que, \n\ndurante o colapso t\u00e9rmico do sistema hidrotermal, outro(s) epis\u00f3dio(s) exalativo-hidrotermal de baixa \n\ntemperatura sejam respons\u00e1veis pela deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de jaspes/umbers. Assim, a mesma fonte de calor que \n\npermite sustentar os sistemas produtivos hidrotermais representa tamb\u00e9m, a fonte de calor que alimenta \n\noutros sistemas, de mais baixa temperatura, favorecendo a recorr\u00eancia de alguns est\u00e1dios de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo sistema, em per\u00edodos temporais distintos. \n\nN\u00e3o obstante a amostragem abranger uma \u00e1rea significativa do dep\u00f3sito e permitir a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o do(s) sistema(s) hidrotermal/hidrotermais respons\u00e1veis pela forma\u00e7\u00e3o deste dep\u00f3sito, uma \n\namostragem mais completa, assim como a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e mapeamento das principais estruturas \n\ntect\u00f3nicas presentes na \u00e1rea, permitiria a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o espacial do padr\u00e3o de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos halos de \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal. \n\nPor fim, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00edndices CCPI, AI e dos AImaiores e AItra\u00e7o corroboram os dados mineral\u00f3gicos e \n\ntexturais, traduzindo uma boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre os dados de geoquimica de rocha total com as \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00f5es mineral\u00f3gicas, texturais e composicionais descritas. Assim, a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o afigura-se \n\ninteressante na prospec\u00e7\u00e3o de mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es do tipo VMS para o ofiolito de Om\u00e3.  \n\nPalavras-chave: Ofiolito de Sumail, Om\u00e3, VMS, altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal, geotermometria, metalogenia \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nX \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe Sumail ophiolite hosts numerous epi to syn-genetic massive sulphide mineralizations in its \n\nCretaceous volcanic sequence. The Mandoos is one of the largest VMS deposits found in the ophiolite \n\nand the lack of detailed studies on its genesis makes it a prime case-study. Thus, this work aims to \n\ndevelop a mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the volcanic sequence that hosts the \n\nmineralization, in order to develop a metallogenetic model for the formation of the deposit, \n\ncharacterizing the hydrothermal alteration associated to the massive sulphide formation, the pinpoint of \n\nits volcanostratigraphic position and to develop geochemical criteria, helpful for mineral exploration \n\npurposes. \n\nConsidering the REE contents and patterns, and the HSFE contents, these volcanic rocks are considered \n\npart of the Lasail volcanic unit, which rocks derive from the partial melting of an already depleted DMM \n\nmantle source, which underwent a previous melt extraction, in a ridge setting. These are \n\nmicroporphyritic basaltic rocks, with tholeiitic affinities, with a primary mineralogy is characterized by \n\naugitic clinopyroxene and bytownitic to labradoritic feldspar microphenocrysts, set in a plagioclase \n\nmicrolite rich matrix, with disseminated Ti-rich magnetite crystals. Oceanic metasomatic alteration is \n\npervasive and responsible for the alteration and replacement of the primary volcanic minerals by (Ca-\n\n)amphiboles+Chl+Ep, Ab and Ttn and by the alteration of volcanic glass to interlayered Chl-Sme, as \n\nwell as other secondary mineral phases such as calcite and calcic-zeolites, as vesicles and fractures \n\ninfills. Sub-volcanic intrusions (dolerites) act as heat sources that allow to sustain structurally controlled \n\nhydrothermal systems, in different periods of time. Low-temperature hydrothermal systems are \n\nresponsible for late-developed Hem+Qz\u00b1Chl\u00b1Cb veins, throughout the sampled area, and, in the SE part \n\nof the deposit, for the deposition of jaspers and umbers. Overall, the hydrothermal alteration includes \n\nsilicification, dissemination of pyrite and chloritization and, in most of the area it is associated to \n\nhydrothermal quartz veins, sometimes occurring with sulphides, distinguishing four different \n\nhydrothermal vein stages: i) Qz+Py, ii) Qz+Py+Ccp\u00b1Sph which are, sometimes, re-opened and Cb+Py \n\nor Qz+Zeol precipitate, denoting an evolution of the hydrothermal fluid; iii and iv) Qz. The hydrothermal \n\nsystem, responsible for the mineralization, is characterized by temperatures between 200-430 \u00baC; it\u2019s \n\ncirculation is responsible for the development of different alteration facies, sometimes with preservation \n\nof oceanic metassomatic alteration effects, such as the albitized microlites. This is the result of the \n\nprimary volcanic rocks permeability but, more importantly, the proximity to the structural features that \n\nact as fluid-flow channels. In extreme cases, the hydrothermal alteration is marked by intense \n\nbrecciation, with hydrothermal quartz and sulphides-bearing veins, silicification and sulphides \n\ndissemination, revealing that the mineralization also took place as sub-seafloor replacement.  \n\nThe lithogeochemical data is coherent with the mineralogical transformations, using the AI and CCPI \n\nindexes. Additionally, during the registered alteration stages, elements such as Ti, Zr, Ta, Yb, Y, Nb \n\nand Ta are considered to have an immobile behaviour, some of them showing a slight mobility, \n\nespecially during hydrothermal alteration. Nevertheless, the established mass balances, during \n\nhydrothermal alteration, record negative balances. Nevertheless, Fe gains are usually accompanied by \n\nMg additions, highlighting the presence of diluted fluids but, for the sampled area of the open pit, the \n\npresence of non-diluted hydrothermal fluids is inferred by gains in Fe (but not in Mg) and metals such \n\nas Cu and Zn. Also, gains in In, Cd, Sn and Tl, as well as Ap disseminations in hydrothermal altered \n\nsamples, reveal an input of late-magmatic fluids into the hydrothermal system.

These relationships include: I) controls on the occurrence of the orebodies within \n\nthe volcanic structures and sequences; II) (sub)volcanic activity acting as a heat-source, producing high \n\nrates of heat advection, required to sustain (modified) sea-water circulation in the oceanic crust \n\n(convection being possible in presence of a quasi-isotropic permeability) and; III) source of metals, \n\nthrough interaction of the sea-water with the footwall volcanic rocks and, sometimes, with late-stage \n\nmagmatic-derived fluids. Thus, the depth of the heat-source, the temporal and spatial distribution of \n\npermeability in the host-rocks as well as the tectonic activity represent the three major factors controlling \n\nthe fluid-flow, discharge and the life span of a VMS-forming hydrothermal system (Hannington, 2014). \n\nLenticular-shaped massive sulphide bodies are mostly composed of pyrite, with subordinate amounts of \n\nchalcopyrite, sphalerite, bornite, tetrahedrite, among others. It usually lies above an inverted cone-\n\nshaped sulphide bearing anastomosed vein system, corresponding to the stringer or stockwork zone, \n\nwhich represent the fluid flow conducts that fed the hydrothermal ore system (Hannington, 2014). The \n\ninteraction of these sea-water derived hydrothermal fluids with the footwall volcanic rocks results in a \n\nseries of chemical reactions, that ultimately generate alteration haloes. These hydrothermal alteration \n\nhaloes vary widely, even in the same ore district, depending on rock permeability, changes in fluid \n\nchemistry and, rock composition, as well as in other physical-chemical variables that control the rate \n\nand extension of mineral/textural transformations (Hannington, 2014). In general, hydrothermal \n\nalteration involves replacement of primary igneous minerals (e.g. pyroxenes, plagioclase, Fe(-Ti) \n\noxides), and volcanic glass, by secondary mineral phases, stable at temperature and chemical \n\nenvironment, such as chlorite, epidote, carbonates, pyrite, albite, sericite, clay minerals and quartz or \n\ndifferent forms of silica (chalcedony, opal). The degree of alteration is also very variable, ranging from \n\nweak, allowing the preservation of primary volcanic textures and rock-forming minerals, to pervasive \n\nand intense, with (almost complete) obliteration of primary textures and minerals.  \n\nDespite this wide range of variation, there are recognizable zonal arrangements related to the \n\nhydrothermal fluid circulation in the genesis of VMS deposits, characterized by particular types of \n\nmineral assemblages that allow the reconstitution of the main paths of fluid flow, sulphide deposition \n\nand water/rock reaction processes (Hannington, 2014). The recognition of hydrothermal alteration \n\nhaloes is therefore critical to the development of exploration vectors, which allow the assessment of \n\nfavourable exploration targets for VMS deposits.\n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\nThe classification of VMS deposits can be made on different basis. Some classification schemes use \n\ntheir metal composition/contents as the main criteria (e.g. Franklin et al. 1981; Franklin et al., 2005; \n\nBarrie and Hannington, 1999), others consider their geological setting (Sawkins, 1976), or host-rock \n\ncomposition (e.g. Barrie and Hanningtion, 1999). An increasingly used classification is the one proposed \n\nby Barrie and Hannington (1999) and later modified by Franklin et al (2005). Therefore, in a first \n\napproach, five different type of VMS districts can be recognized: I) bimodal-mafic; II) mafic; III) pelitic-\n\nmafic; IV) bimodal-felsic; V) siliciclastic-felsic. These types are then sub-divided on the basis of their \n\nlithofacies association, providing a way of pinpointing the volcano-sedimentary environment of a \n\nspecific deposit (Franklin et al., 2005): \n\nI). The bimodal-mafic VMS provinces (or districts) corresponds to incipient rift-related bimodal \n\nvolcanic arcs, above intra-oceanic subduction (oceanic suprasubduction rifted arc), dominated by basalts \n\nbut up to 25% of felsic rocks; pillowed and massive basaltic flows, felsic flows and domes with minor \n\nbasaltic and felsic volcaniclastic rocks occur within sedimentary sequences dominated by graywackes, \n\nsandstones and shales, with local debris flows (e.g. Abitibi, Canada; Flin Flon, Canada). \n\nII). The mafic type VMS provinces correlates with intra-oceanic back-arcs and mid-ocean ridges, \n\nophiolite and ophiolite-like sequences, dominated by MORB-boninite and arc tholeiite sequences with \n\nprevailing pillowed and massive basaltic flows, minor felsic flows and/or domes, synvolcanic mafic \n\ndykes or sills. Minor sulphide-rich/reduced or hematite/oxidized argillite, chert or tuffs also occur (e.g. \n\nKonuto, Canada; Troodos, Cyprus; Sumail, Oman). At fast spreading ridges, high temperature fluids \n\ncirculate at relatively shallow depths and the ore-forming systems tend to be small and/or short-lived or \n\nsubjected to strong intermittency, due to the frequent volcanic eruptions that disrupt the hydrothermal \n\npaths and bury the sulphide accumulations; in such settings, hydrothermal fields and vents are rapidly \n\ndisplaced from their heat source. In slow-spreading ridges the magma supply rate is lower, hence, \n\nhydrothermal systems are supported by long-lived high heat flow will have the chance to produce larger \n\nsulphide accumulations. \n\nIII). The pelitic-mafic corresponds to mature, basalt-pelite dominated back-arc sequences, in juvenile \n\naccreted arc assemblages, typically devoid of felsic volcanic rocks. The sedimentary sequences are often \n\nof distal flysch type, but they can include carbonaceous shales, siltstones and minor sandstones, besides \n\nmafic sills (e.g. Outukumpo, Finland; Besshi district, Japan).  \n\nIV). The bimodal-felsic association is common in continental margin arcs and related back-arcs in which \n\nfelsic volcaniclastic rocks dominate, along with minor basaltic/andesitic flows and clastic sedimentary \n\nrocks (e.g. Pilbara, Australia; Eskay Creek, Canada). \n\nV). Siliciclastic-felsic type compares to mature epicontinental back-arcs where siliciclastic sequences \n\nprevail over felsic volcaniclastic and/or massive flows or domes with even minor mafic (tholeiitic to \n\nalkaline) flows or sills; often the sedimentary sequences contain Fe-, Mn- Ca- and Ba-rich chemiogenic \n\nsedimentary rocks/sediments (e.g. Iberian Pyrite Belt, Portugal and Spain; Lachlan Fold Belt, Mexico).  \n\nAnother commonly used classification scheme distinguishes three types of VMS deposits: i) Besshi type \n\nVMS, broadly correlated to the pelitic-mafic type VMS; ii) Kuroko-type VMS deposits, corresponding \n\nto the bimodal mafic type; and iii) Cyprus-type, representing obducted VMS deposits, i.e. of the mafic \n\ntype. \n\nThe Sumail ophiolite hosts of a series of VMS occurrences, classified as mafic-type VMS. These are \n\nmostly found in the northern part of Oman, along the Batinah Coast, in the Sohar region, some of them \n\n\n\nI: INTRODUCTION \n\n3 \n\nirregularly mined since the Bronze Age (for Cu and, where gossanized sulphide mounds exist, for Au). \n\nThe most important deposits are Aarja, Hatta, Lasail, Bayda, Shinas, Al Bishara, Rakha and Mandoos. \n\nThese deposits are typical Cyprus-type ore systems and totalize 30 to 50Mt of ores (Galley et al., 2007; \n\nFranklin et al., 2005) with an average copper content of 2.3% (Gilgen et al., 2014), comparable to values \n\nfor the Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus. The known orebodies are, usually, massive pyritic masses with \n\nminor chalcopyrite and sphalerite, hosted in the extrusive Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Turonian) \n\nsequence. These mineralizations are thought to have been formed in black smokers sulphide mounds \n\nand hydrothermal fields, analogous to those found in present-day oceanic settings (e.g. East Pacific \n\nRise).  \n\nThe Mandoos deposit was identified in 2009, when Mawarid Mining conducted the first exploration \n\nsurvey in the area, through an airborne VTEM (versatile time-domain electromagnetic) geophysical \n\nassessment, during which three other targets were defined. A later geological exploration survey, \n\nincluding an adequate drilling program, confirmed the existence of massive sulphides in three of the \n\nfour previously delimited targets, Mandoos 1 being the bigger and copper richer target. The fourth target, \n\nMandoos 4, did not result in the discovery of a VMS orebody (Mawarid Mining, 2014).  \n\nThe mining operations at Mandoos 1 started in October 2011, in an open-pit, that reached the maximum \n\nexploitable extension in mid-February 2015, when the mine finally closed, due to financial/economic \n\nfactors. Although the mining activities were abandoned there is still some potential to expand \n\nexploitation underground and mine about the remainder of the orebody, an option which is currently \n\nunder consideration. According to Mawarid Mining, the deposit contains about 8 Mt of copper sulphide \n\nore, with 5 Mt in reserves at 1.8% Cu (Rob Willis, pers. comm. to Ana Jesus, February, 2015). \n\nThe main objective of this project is to provide a study of the volcanic rocks forming the hanging and \n\nfootwall sequence, hosting the Mandoos massive sulphide ores. The petrographic, mineralogical and \n\ngeochemical characterization of a representative set of samples, collected at the open pit and 6 different \n\ndrill cores, allowed: I) the discrimination of the petrological (igneous) processes responsible for the \n\ngenesis of these rocks, especially regarding the tectonic setting in which the rocks erupted (MORB s.l. \n\nvs SSZ signatures); II) the correct assignment of a volcanic-stratigraphic position to the deposit, and III) \n\nthe distinction between the inprints of the low-temperature oceanic metasomatic alteration from those \n\ndue to hydrothermal processes, directly related to the massive sulphide deposition (i.e. hydrothermal \n\nalteration/mineralization haloes). The analysis of their extent and nature, as well as the crucial factors \n\nfor their development, represent significant inputs to an intended metallogenic model of the deposit, \n\nproviding also crucial information to further exploration surveys and economic feasibility studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER II  \nGEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n \n\nII.1. REGIONAL SETTING\u2013 OPHIOLITE OBDUCTION AND GEODYNAMIC MODELS \n\nThe Sumail (also referred as Semail or Samail) ophiolite constitutes the best preserved and less deformed \n\nophiolitic sequence in the world. It is found in the Oman mountains, in a ~600 km long, and up to 150-\n\nwide belt and includes a complete section of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle (10-15 km thick), \n\none of the Neo-Tethyan Oceanic basins. This oceanic crust fragment is part of the Alpine-Himalayan \n\nfold-thrust collisional belt that extends from the Mediterranean to the Far East (Lippard et al., 1986; \n\nGoodenough et al., 2014; Hou &amp; Zhang, 2015) (Figure II. 1). It is one of the many Tethyan ophiolites, \n\nformed during the oceanic-continental collision related to the closing of the Neo-Tethys ocean, result of \n\nthe Africa/Nubia and Eurasia tectonic plate collision, coeval of the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean \n\n(Lippard et al., 1986).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.1- Distribution of the major Tethyan suture zones and ophiolites, found in the Alpine-Himalayan collisional belt \n\nAdapted from Dilek &amp; Furnes (2009). \n\n\n\nII. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\nII.1.1. MAIN UNITS OF THE SUMAIL OPHIOLITE \n\nIn the Sumail, a complete ophiolitic sequence (as defined in the Penrose Conference, 1972) is preserved \n\n(Figure 2 and 3). Deformation is not widespread and resulted in minor doming and thrusting during \n\nobduction (Gilgen et al., 2014). Instead, the deformation was strongly partitioned into a basal thrust and \n\nregional shear-zones (Boudier et al., 1988). Thus, this ophiolite preserves the main structure of the \n\nspreading centres, as well as the lithostratigraphic relationships, reason why it is widely used as an \n\nanalogue for understanding present day oceanic crustal processes (Nicolas et al., 2000; Godard et al., \n\n2006; Gilgen et al., 2014).  \n\nThe mantle portion comprises mantle peridotites, mainly harzburgites, originated from partial melting \n\nof fertile spinel lherzolites; other peridotitic rocks include dunites and minor lherzolites, displaying \n\nvarious tectonic and plastic flow deformation (micro)structures, as well as evidence of various \n\nserpentinization episodes (Boudier, 1985). The Moho transition zone (MTZ) has a variable thickness, \n\nfrom ten to hundreds of meters. It represents a level of magmatic exchange between asthenospheric \n\nmantle and the oceanic crust, mainly composed of dunite with various types of segregations and \n\nintrusions (gabbroic, piroxenitic and chromitites) (Boudier, 1995).  \n\nAbove the MTZ, the lowermost crustal section composed of a gabbroic suite, layered and foliated- \n\nolivine gabbros, troctolites, wehrlites (Boudier, 1996; Boudier, 2000). The layered gabbros are found in \n\nthe lower part of the crustal section and includes alternating layers of gabbroic cummulates, anorthosite \n\nand (ultra-)mafic portions: foliation is commonly defined by plagioclase laths and elongated crystals, \n\ncorresponding to magmatic flow and compaction structures (Boudier, 1996). The upper gabbroic section \n\nis composed of foliated gabbros, having a linear and planar fabric. The foliation changes gradually from \n\nflat lying- in the layered gabbros- to a steeper dip towards the foliated gabbros, where it is almost parallel \n\nto the sheeted dykes. In some areas, the foliation in the upper gabbros disappears, forming patches of \n\namphibole-rich isotropic gabbros in the root zone of the sheeted dykes (Boudier, 2000).  \n\nThe top of the gabbroic sequence, near (or at) the sheeted dyke transition, is intruded by trondhjemites, \n\nwhich genesis is still under debate. They are commonly interpreted as late-stage, extreme differentiates \n\nof basaltic melts (e.g. Lippard et al., 1986), thus providing a good estimate of the age of the ophiolite. \n\nNevertheless, some authors distinguish three different type of trondhjemites (Rollinson, 2006): (1) the \n\nearlier ones, formed as a result of partial melting of MORB-like gabbros, previously hydrated by sea-\n\nwater derived fluids (second stage melts); (2) later trondjhemites result of differentiation of a magma \n\nproduced from re-melting of a depleted harzburgitic mantle source; and (3) mantle-hosted trondhjemites \n\nformed by mixing or contamination processes, during or immediately following the emplacement of \n\nophiolites (e.g. Rollinson, 2006). This implies that the trondhjemites found throughout the ophiolite are \n\nnot providing the same age, since they originate from diachronic geological processes, challenging the \n\naverage age of ~95Ma, often considered (e.g. Tilton, 1981; Lippard et al., 1986; Boudier et al., 1998; \n\nSearle and Cox, 1999; Searle et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2005; Dilek &amp; Furnes, 2009; Goodenough et \n\nal., 2010; Dilek &amp; Furnes, 2011). \n\nThe uppermost part of the gabbroic section of the crust is crosscut by dolerite dykes, particularly at the \n\ntransition zone to the sheeted dykes sequence. The dykes represent the feeder channels of the overlying \n\nextrusive magmatic sequence. The extrusive rocks comprise a suite of Cretaceous volcanic rocks, mostly \n\npillow lavas and massive flows, that host numerous epigenetic volcanic massive sulphide orebodies \n\n(VMS). The volcanic rocks are affected by a set of normal faults, which are later intruded by un-\n\ndeformed dykes, sometimes displaying evidence of hydrothermal alteration. This suggests that these \n\nfaults were related to seafloor extension and contemporaneous volcanism, as well as hydrothermal \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n7 \n\nactivity- with sulphide deposition (Gilgen et al., 2014). The volcanic rocks are often overlain by pelagic \n\nsedimentary rocks, with Cenomanian to Turonian microfossils (Fleet &amp; Robertson, 1980).  \n\nConsidering the accepted U-Pb zircon ages for several intrusive bodies at different levels in the \n\nophiolitic section, ophiolite (e.g., Warren et al., 2005), and the combination with the microfossils from \n\npelagic sediments, it is possible to infer that sea-floor volcanism was active for 10 M.y., between 98.8 \n\nand ~89 M.y. (Gilgen et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.2- Geological map of the Sumail ophiolite showing the main VMS deposits found in Oman, associated with the \n\nCretaceous volcanism.

GEODYNAMIC EVOLUTION \n\nThe opening of the Neo-Tethys and the Hawasina basin began in the mid-Permian, with the \n\nintracontinental rifting of the Gondwana, related to the closure of the Paleo-Tethys (Muttoni et al., 2009; \n\nBerra et al., 2016; N\u00e9meth et al., 2016). The intracontinental rifting is marked by bimodal alkaline \n\nvolcanism (Haiby volcanics), along with siliciclastic rocks and carbonates sedimentation, part of the \n\nHaybi Complex/Hamrat Duru group (Cox, 2000; Searl, 2007). Lateral facies variations account for the \n\nformation of shelf carbonates of the Sumeni Group and progressively distal siliciclastic slope and basin \n\nfacies from the Hawasina Group (e.g. Searl, 2007 and references therein). The inexistence of calc-\n\nalkaline magmatism in the Arabian margin, as well as the evolution of the sedimentary record, supports \n\nit behaved as a passive margin, until mid-Cretaceous (Searl, 2007). This excludes the possibility of a \n\nSW-dipping subduction zone, where oceanic crust was consumed, as proposed by Gregory et al., (1998) \n\nand Gray et al., (2000) (Searl, 2007). \n\nIn the early-Jurassic, alkaline magmatism ceased, giving way to sea-floor spreading in the Late-\n\nCretaceous. The evolution of the extrusive sequence (MORB-like to arc/boninitic signatures), together \n\nwith the  petrological and geochemical features of the mantellic and gabbroic sequence and the presence \n\nof the late intrusive bodies in the MTZ (e.g. Yamaski et al., 2006; Goodenough et al., 2010), sustain, \n\nuntil today, a long-lasting and vivid debate regarding the geodynamic setting of the Sumail \u2013 whether a \n\nmid-ocean ridge (e.g. Boudier et al., 1985; Boudier and Nicolas, 1995) or a suprasubduction zone setting \n\n(SSZ) (e.g. Pearce et al., 1981; Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The first volcanic phase \n\n(V1), represented by the lowermost Geotimes unit, is attributed to a MORB-like setting or a back-arc \n\nbasin, while the V2 volcanic phase, with arc-like geochemical signatures and the overlying Alley and \n\nboninitic volcanic rocks reveals an arc-like setting. These variations have been interpreted as a result of \n\nan intra-oceanic thrusting and subduction initiation, thus modifying the magma source zone.  \n\nThe intra-oceanic thrusting has long been understood as the mechanism that enabled the formation of \n\nthe metamorphic sole that underlies the ophiolite (Breton et al., 2004). The metamorphic sole is a \n\ndiscrete ~200-300m thick thrust sheet, characterized by an inverted metamorphic gradient, from \n\ngranulites to amphibolite gneisses and green-schist facies metasedimentary rocks at the bottom \n\n(quartzites, volcaniclastic and carbonates) (Cox, 2000; Searl et al., 2003, Breton et al., 2004; Searl, \n\n2007). The sole is present at the base of the entire ophiolite and the deformation fabrics are parallel to \n\nthe Sumail thrust (Searl, 1980; Cox, 2000). There is evidence for localized partial melting within the \n\nsole, with the presence of tonalitic intrusions in the granulitic rocks (Cox, 2000). The heat source for the \n\nformation of the metamorphic sole is considered to be the downward heat transfer from young and hot \n\nover-thrusted mantellic rocks (>600\u00baC) (Ishikawa et al., 2005). Geochemical data from the metabasaltic \n\nrocks that compose the sole indicates that these rocks are derived from Triasic to Jurassic tholeiitic rocks \n\nof the Haybi volcanics, as well as MORB-like oceanic crust, that formed the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust \n\n(Cox, 2000, Searl, 2007). This intra oceanic thrusting explains the presence of granitic rocks, which \n\nintrude the mantle and gabbroic sequence of the ophiolite. These peraluminous granitic intrusions are \n\nderived from a mixed-source, which are the Haiby complex volcanic and sedimentary rocks, preserved \n\nas green-schists to granulite-facies rocks (Cox, 2000; Searl et al., 2003; Searl, 2007). The fluids released \n\nfrom the sole may also explain the geochemical variation of the ophiolite volcanic rocks, due to \n\ncontamination and metassomatic fertilization of the mantle wedge, and thus accounting for the low-Ti \n\nandesitic volcanism (Alley) and of the boninites found in the volcanic sequence (Ishikawa et al., 2002; \n\n2005; Breton et al., 2004). Notwithstanding, other authors propose that this geochemical variation is not \n\nattributed to intra-oceanic thrusting, and consequent arc-formation, but to sea-water contamination into \n\nresidual and shallow peridotitic rocks. The partial (re-)melting of these hydrothermally altered (by sea-\n\nwater derived fluids) mantle rocks experience P-T-H2O evolutionary trends that resemble the \n\n\n\nII. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n \n\n12 \n\npetrogenetic conditions for andesitic-boninitic magma genesis, usually attributed to subduction zones \n\n(Benoit et al., 1999; Nonnotte et al., 2005)  \n\nDuring obduction of the ophiolite, c.a. 95 M.y., the Arabian continental crust was subducted, up to \n\ndepths of about 80km. These rocks were brought into eclogite facies conditions \n\n(omphacite+garnet+glaucophane+phengite) along with metapelitic rocks (garnet+chloritoid), defining \n\na clockwise P-T path, with estimated peak metamorphic conditions of 20-23\u00b12.5 kbar and 540\u00b175\u00baC at \n\n82-79 M.y. (Searl and Cox, 1999; Searl et al., 2003, Warren et al., 2005). These HP-LT (High Pressure-\n\nLow Temperautre) rocks, outcropping in the Saih Hatat window, are also associated to blue schists and \n\ncarpatholite-kaolinite schists. In this area (Saih Hatat), the metamorphic grade increases towards NE, \n\nwhere the eclogites occur as mafic boudins in the As Sifah sub-window. This subduction was \u201cchocked\u201d \n\nand exhumation was triggered by the positive buoyancy of the Arabic continental crust, as well as the \n\nextension of the ophiolite nappe (Cox, 2000; Sear et al., 2003).  \n\nThe ophiolite and its coupled metamorphic sole are underlain by sedimentary allochthonous, highly \n\nimbricate nappes- Hawasina nappes. These consist on Mesozoic hemi-pelagic and pelagic sediments \n\nthat show complex geometries with several evidences of syn-emplacement folding phases, and low-\n\ngrade metamorphism (greenschists facies). The Hawasina-nappes are formed by three lower thrust \n\nsheets of proximal facies turbiditic sediments with a variable, usually kilometric, thickness with minor \n\nlimestone breccias, pelagic sediments, basaltic sills and volcanic layers (Lippard et al., 1986). It is \n\ndivided into four different formations: the Halfa and Haliw formations, the lower and more deformed, \n\nconsisting in highly deformed upper Triasic to lower-Cretaceous cherts and thin pelagic limestones; \n\nPermo-Triasic limestones, the Oman Exotics; redeposited upper Triasic limestone breccias and pelagic \n\nsediments from the Al Aridh formation (Lippard, et al., 1986; Cox, 2000). \n\nThe Batinah nappe is structurally overlying the Sumail mantelic and crustal ophiolitic sections, although \n\nit is accepted that this group (Batinah group), divided in a lower, Triasic to Jurassic portion- Sakhin-, \n\nand upper, early/mid-Jurassic to Cretaceous- Salahi-, was part of the Hawasina allochthonous; initially \n\noverridden by the ophiolite, it was thrusted above the Sumail during the last stages of the emplacement \n\n(Cox, 2000).  \n\nThe combination of the isostatic rebound and the emplacement of the nappes resulted in a marine \n\nregression, exposing the ophiolitic sequence. Hence, a late Maastrichtian unconformity is found, \n\noverlain by rudist-bearing beach deposits and later (Paleocene to mid/late Eocene) shallow marine \n\nfossiliferous carbonates. This carbonate sedimentation prevailed until the Oligocene, with marine \n\ncarbonates (Lippard et al., 1986).  \n\nIn the Miocene, the uplift related deformation phase, warped the whole sequence into large scale open \n\nfolds, caused by a biaxial compression. Following the deformation phase, an erosional event lasted until \n\nthe Anthropocene, with the formation of thick piedmont deposits, alluvial, coastal, aeolian, Sabkah \n\ndeposits (Bathinah coast deposits) and over 4km of cenozoic molasses representing ~100 000km\n3\n of \n\nsediments (Lippard et al., 1986). \n\nNevertheless, some questions remain unsolved, especially regarding the driving mechanisms that \n\nexplain the transition of the passive margin to an active margin, with the obduction/subduction of the \n\nHawasina oceanic crust and the lead edge of the Arabian plate, respectively. Despite this, some authors \n\nrelated this transition of kinematic change in the plates movement with the anticlockwise rotation of the \n\nAfrican plate, associated to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, during the Cretaceous (Coleman, \n\n1981; Michard et al., 1991; Breton et al., 2004; Burg, 2015). Other topics, such as the geochemical \n\nvariation of the extrusive sequence and its geodynamic setting remain widely debated and unsolved.  \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n13 \n\nII.2. VOLCANOSTRATIGRAPHY, TECTONIC SETTING AND MS ACCUMULATION \n\nThe volcanostratigraphy of the extrusive sequence of the Sumail ophiolite has long been studied and \n\ndebated. The volcanic sequence is made up of different volcanostratigraphic units formed in overlapping \n\nvolcanic centres, in a set of spreading axis, and later off-axis setting. The majority of the research was \n\ndeveloped in the northern part of Oman, where the volcanic sequence is best exposed, aiming to define \n\na group of mappable and distinct volcanic units, with distinctive features. Alabaster et al. (1982) defined \n\nfive different volcanic units in the Bayda-Aarja-Lasail area and provided field, petrographic and \n\ngeochemical criteria to distinguish them. Several authors have claimed that the field criteria is \n\ninsufficient to distinguish them outside the same area, mapped by Alabaster et al. (1982). None of the \n\nlater works on the volcanostratigraphy of the ophiolite defined more than five different units. In 2003, \n\nGodard et al. proposed a new classification, defining three different volcanic units based on geochemical \n\ndata and paleomagnetic data, correlating its volcanic units with the ones defined by Alabaster et al. \n\n(1982). Nonetheless, the volcanostratigraphy proposed by Alabaster et al. (1982) remains as the most \n\nwidely accepted and applied. This volcanic sequence is thus divided into five different units: \n\nI) Geotimes, the lowermost unit, directly overlies the co-magmatic sheeted dyke complex. It is \n\ncomposed of 0.75-1km thick sequence of aphyric tubular basaltic to occasional andesitic large pillow \n\nlavas with subordinated aphyric massive flows, pillow breccias and hyaloclastites (Figure II.4 [D]). The \n\nred/brownish hematitic alteration is one of the diagnostic field criteria. Geochemically, these lavas are \n\nslightly depleted in incompatible elements compared to N-MORB, namely HFSE such as Nb and Ta.  \n\n(Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986; Godard et al., 2003; Gilgen et al., 2014). \n\nII) The Lasail unit comprises grey to pale greenish, basaltic to andesitic smaller pillow lavas and \n\nfrequent massive flows with porphyritic texture- olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase phenocrysts- \n\nwith a thickness of ~0.75km. The lavas are depleted in LREEs and incompatible elements, compared to \n\nN-MORB and the concentrations in Zr and other refractory elements are lower than Geotimes\u2019 lavas. \n\nAlabaster et al. (1982) noted that the Lasail unit is only present in some areas of the ophiolite and \n\ninterpreted them as seamounts, overlying the Geotimes unit, whereas Godard et al. (2003), considered \n\nthe Lasail equivalent unit (V2-1) to be present throughout the entire ophiolite. Alabaster and Pearce \n\n(1985) defined the transition of Geotimes/Lasail as transitional and Kusano et al. (2012) described \n\nGeotimes and Lasail unit as being interdigitated, considering Lasail a sub-unit of Geotimes (Kusano et \n\nal., 2012; Gilgen et al., 2014). \n\nIII) The Alley unit includes a ~0.75km thick sequence of grey or brown-coloured, meter-sized \n\namygdaloidal microporphyritic basaltic to rhyolitic pillow lavas that overlie the Lasail and, sometimes, \n\nthe Geotimes unit. These amygdules and vesicles are commonly filled with zeolites and celadonite, the \n\nclinopyroxene and plagioclase microphenocrysts sometimes developing glomerophyric textures. Poly \n\nand monomict breccias are common. They are characterized by a REE pattern similar to Lasail\u2019s with \n\nslighter higher REE concentrations. Geochemically, the distinction between Lasail and Alley consists \n\nin the latter having lower Cr concentrations and higher Zr contents. \n\nIV) The clinopyroxene-phyric unit occurs as small basaltic porphyritic flows with abundant \n\nclinopyroxene phenocrysts. They show low Zr and Ti concentrations and high Cr contents. \n\nV) The Salahi unit comprises alkaline to transitional massive thick flows, that regularly form joint \n\ncolumns and occurs only at one location. \n\nIshikawa et al. (2002) reported boninitic lava outcrops, associated to Alley lavas, and recent \n\nvolcanostratigraphic reviews (e.g. Gilgen et al., 2014) found them to have a widespread and regional \n\n\n\nII. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n \n\n14 \n\nextent, defining the Boninitic Alley unit. The question remains, whether he boninite occurrences belong \n\nto the same unit or not. In general, they are vesicular pillow lavas and massive flows, several meters \n\nthick, with porphyritic texture. The phenocrysts and microphenocrysts are composed of orthopyroxene, \n\nclinopyroxene, olivine and chrome-spinel. This Boninitic Alley unit is macroscopically and \n\nmineralogically similar and equivalent to the clinopyroxene-phyric unit, defined by Alabaster et al. \n\n(1982). \n\nThese new volcanostratigraphic reviews (Gilgen et al., 2014) distinguish four main volcanic units, \n\ncomprising, from bottom to top, the Geotimes, Lasail, Alley and Boninitic Alley units, which correspond \n\nto the division accepted and followed in this work (Figure II. 5). \n\nThe Geotimes unit erupted in a fast spreading ridge setting (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986; \n\nKusano et al., 2012; Gilgen et al., 2014). The nature of this spreading ridge is under debated: a typical \n\nmid-ocean ridge (Boudier et al., 1997; Godard et al., 2006) or a suprasubduction marginal basin \n\n(Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Lasail unit shows a transitional geochemical nature, \n\nbetween ridge and arc-like geochemical affinity (Alabaster e tal, 1982; Searl, 2007). The more evolved \n\ncompositions suggest an off-axis volcanism, occasionally influenced by on-axis volcanism, resulting \n\ninto the interdigitated of both units (Gilgen et al., 2014), although some authors still debate if their \n\ngeochemical signature marks a SSZ-signature. It is widely accepted that the Alley unit erupted in a \n\nsuprasubduction setting, although the nature of the subduction is itself debated. The more consensual \n\nidea is that the subduction zone was already established when Geotimes erupted (Alabaster et al., 1982; \n\nLippard et al., 1986; Godard et al., 2003). The Boninitic Alley unit is altogether similar to other boninites \n\nin numerous modern-day tectonic settings related to spreading ridges, like the Neogene boninites in the \n\nnorthern termination of the Tonga Trench (Gilgen et al., 2014 and citations therein), interpreted as the \n\ninterference of the NW bifurcation of the Lau spreading ridge with the Tonga trench. Together, the \n\nLasail and the Alley unit are considered to form a coherent sequence, as transitional lavas from a N-\n\nMORB-like geochemical signature (Geotimes) to boninitic (Boninitic Alley). Nevertheless, some \n\nauthors propose that this geochemical variation (MORB-like to arc-like signatures) is assigned to a range \n\nFigure II.5- Columnar section showing the different volcanic units found in the extrusive portion of the Sumail ophiolite and \n\nthe VMS deposits found within that sequence, in their volcanostratigraphic positions. Adapted from Gilgen et al. (2014). \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n15 \n\nof variation of the peridotitic rocks alteration, induced by sea-water derived fluids, whose partial melting \n\ngenerates andesitic-boninitic-lile magmas, as previously mentioned. \n\nThe main horizon for VMS exploration was thought to be the Geotimes/Lasail contact and, to a minor \n\nextent, the Geotimes-Alley, defining the two major productive periods, in terms of VMS formation \n\n(Gilgen et al., 2014). The first comprises the period after the Geotimes unit extrusion, in which the \n\nspreading center and off-axis (sub)volcanic activity acted as heat sources for the hydrothermal \n\nconvection and sulphide precipitation, forming at least 7 MS deposits. The Geotimes eruption was \n\nintermittent, allowing the formation of, at least, one intra-Geotimes VMS deposit, in the volcanic \n\nquiescence periods. The Lasail off-axis volcanism later covered some of the deposits. The fact that \n\nLasail lavas erupted in a possible off-axis setting, thus lacking a proper heat source, possibly explains \n\nthe absence of intra-Lasail sulphide accumulations. The second major period for sulphide accumulations \n\nand productive hydrothermal systems to develop initiates with the Alley and Boninitic Alley extrusion. \n\nThe Alley unit eruption covers longer-lived hydrothermal systems that originated deposits hosted in the \n\nGeotimes-Alley transition but the period between Alley volcanic activity generated at least one major \n\nsulphide accumulation system- Shinas. The existence of, at least, four major deposits hosted in the \n\nBoninitic Alley unit shows that the intermittence of this volcanism also allowed several important \n\nsulphide accumulations. The period between sulphide accumulation and its \u201csealing\u201d is also accountable \n\nfor oceanic-oxidation events, with the development of oceanic weathering profiles in the sulphide body.  \n\nNew-found deposits and the re-examination of the volcanostratigraphic controls of massive sulphide \n\noccurrences, using clinopyroxene and whole-rock geochemistry, of the footwall and hanging wall of \n\nseveral VMS deposits, demonstrates that the idea that there were only two main periods of time for MS \n\naccumulation is not suitable (Gilgen et al., 2014). Although most of the sulphide ores are, indeed, hosted \n\nin the Geotimes/Lasail and Geotimes/Alley transition, numerous deposits (including some of the most \n\nrecent discoveries) are hosted within volcanic units, such as the Aswad deposit (Geotimes), Shinas \n\n(Alley) or the Daris-3A-5, Rakah and Safwa deposits (Boninitic Alley) (Figure II.5). This suggests that \n\nall hiatus in the volcanic activity (contacts between units, umbers or cherts) represent potential periods \n\nin which hydrothermal activity and sulphide accumulation was possible, and that horizon may, thus, \n\nhost a MS deposit. \n\nII.2.1. THE MANDOOS DEPOSIT \n\nThe Mandoos deposit, is found near the Sohar, beneath eight to thirty-four-meter-thick wadi fluvial \n\ngravels within a volcanic sequence which is not assigned to any volcanic unit, in the volcanostratigraphic \n\nsequence. The magnetic data recovered from the exploration surveys suggests that this deposit is likely \n\nto be intra-Alley or hosted within the Lasail volcanic unit, consisting in pillow lavas and massive flows \n\n(Mawarid Mining, 2014). The massive sulphide body consists of a pyritic mass, including minor \n\nchalcopyrite and sphalerite, presenting evidence for multiple brecciation events; with a variable \n\nthickness (up to 60 m thick in the northernmost area, decreasing towards south), extending 250m (in \n\nlength) to the south area, this massive sulphide orebody was interpreted as being formed in a topographic \n\ndepression or a graben, later affected by sea-water oxidation processes. The hydrothermal alteration is \n\ncharacterized by the presence of carbonates, albite, chlorite, quartz and smectite (Gilgen et al., 2014). \n\nQuartz and sulphide veins form a discreet stockwork, within silicified basalts. The hanging wall shows \n\nless alteration, possibly related to alteration processes distinct from those that acted upon the footwall \n\nrocks. Like for most of the recently discovered VMS deposits in Oman, there are no detailed studies for \n\nMandoos and consistent published data is lacking. Therefore, its size and unknown volcanostratigraphic \n\nposition make it an excelent case study within the Omani scenario, from where a relevant contribution \n\nto the understanding of mafic hosted-type deposits may be expected.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER III  \nLABORATORIAL AND ANALYTICAL \n\nPROCEDURES \n\n \n\nThe laboratiorial and sample preparation work carried out during this study included several stages: (I) \n\ndrill-core re-logging and sampling; (II) sample lab processing; (III) petrography; (IV) mineral \n\nchemistry; and (V) whole-rock geochemistry. \n\nDrill c.ore re-logging and sampling \n\nSix drill cores were sampled in the Mawarid drill core deposit, in March 2016, representing different \n\nsectors of the deposit: (I) MD 174 the \u201ccentral\u201d zone; (II) MD150 and MD178 from the lower/SW \n\ncentral zone; and (III) the MD 431, MD430 and MD429 set, located in the most southwestern part of \n\nthe deposit (Appendix I). These were chosen considering drill core availability and good preservation. \n\nIndeed, drill core deterioration was a major conditioning factor to the sampling objectives. \n\nRe-logging took place from end of March to mid-April in GUtech facilities. This work made it possible \n\nto recognize the overall volcanic sequence and to outline sampling targets.  \n\nSampling aimed to obtain a representative set of samples of both the hanging and footwall volcanic \n\nrocks: different volcanic- primary and secondary- textures/facies, hydrothermally altered samples and \n\n(apparently) fresh rocks.  \n\nSome samples collected from the open pit mine by Ana Jesus in May 2015 were also used in this work; \n\nthey represent the northern most portion of the deposit, where the massive sulphide body was thicker. \n\nSample preparation \n\nAfter collecting the samples, they were processed for the preparation of polished thin sections and \n\nwhole-rock geochemistry, using the SQU and FCUL facilities, from May to September 2016.  \n\nPetrography and mineral chemistry: \n\nThe preparation of thin sections consisted in the following procedure: (1) identification of textural and \n\nmineralogical features of interest; (2) manufacturing of rectangular slabs, using small diamond saws; \n\n(3) gluing the rock slabs into un-polished glasse slices, using a two-part resin epoxy resin with high \n\nrefractive index and mechanic resistance; (4) cutting the obtained chips to 0.5 mm thickness, using a \n\nprecision diamond saw; (5) grinding the glued chips, until they reach a 40-45 \u00b5m thickness, with an \n\nautomatic lapping equipment; (6) polishing the rock surfaces with ever finer diamond-pastes, until a \n\nuniformly smooth plane is obtained and a thickness of 30 \u00b5m. For some samples, the presence of \n\nexpansive clays/phyllosilicates created various technical problems during the thin section making \n\nprocess, posing additional difficulties during the polishing stage.  \n\n\n\nIII. LABORATORIAL AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES \n\n18 \n\nWhole-rock Geochemistry: \n\nFor the whole-rock geochemistry, a single procedure was used for all the selected samples: (1) cutting \n\nin thin slabs; (2) emery polishing, eliminating all possible contamination derived from the saw and \n\nweathering; (3) reduction of the slabs to chip size using a hammer, with the samples wrapped in white \n\npaper; (4) when necessary, another size reduction using a chromium hardened steel roll mill; (5) \n\npowdering, using an agate ring mill, when the samples weighted more than 100g or had enough volume \n\nto fill the space between the agate rings, or using two smaller agate ball mills, if the weight/volume of \n\nthe sample was not enough to use the agate ring mill.  \n\nPetrography  \n\nThe mineralogical and petrographic description of the thin sections was made from July until November \n\n2016, in FCUL facilities.  \n\nThis characterization was made using both reflected and transmitted light microscopy, identifying and \n\ncharacterizing the mineralogical and textural diversity of the volcanic sequence, with a special emphasis \n\non the mineralogical transformations between primary and secondary phases related to oceanic \n\nmetasomatism and hydrothermal activity, synchronous of sulphide deposition. This was documented by \n\na set of microphotographs that illustrate the most important and representative mineralogical and textural \n\nfeatures. \n\nBased on this petrographic study, a set of representative samples were gathered, to be used for the \n\nsubsequent mineral chemistry studies. \n\nAnalytical conditions \n\nElectron Probe Micro-Analyser (EPMA) \n\nThe mineral chemistry data was obtained using a set of selected representative polished thin sections, \n\nwhich were covered by a 20nm thick carbon coating, in the Electronic Microprobe Lab at FCUL. The \n\nused equipment was a JEOL JXA 8200 Superprobe, equipped with four wavelength-dispersive \n\nspectrometers (WDS), six analysing crystals (LIF, LIFH, PET, PETH, TAP and LDED2) and secondary \n\nand back-scattered electron detectors as well as a coupled energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). This \n\nallowed the quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative chemical analyses of mineral phases. All the \n\nmeasurements were made with a 20 second acquisition time for the peaks, and 5 seconds for the \n\nbackground. The accelerating voltage was 15kV, with a current beam of 25nA and a beam spot diameter \n\nof 5\u00b5m. Natural mineral and metallic standards were used as standards. The detection limits for the \n\ndifferent measured elements, as well as the used standards, can be found in Appendix II \n\nThe main objectives of data acquisition were i) resolution of pending questions about the petrographic \n\nstudy, more specifically the identification of mineral phases whose small size and/or occurrence mode \n\nprevented an unambiguous optical conclusion; (ii) identification of accessory mineral phases, \n\nimpossible to determine properly, under the optical microscope; and (iii) characterization of variations \n\nin chemical composition exhibited by mineral phases, found in different textural arrangements and more \n\nimportantly by various generations of the same phase, when polishing conditions were adequate. \n\n  \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n19 \n\nWhole-rock geochemistry \n\nFollowing sample preparation, major and trace were measured using two different methods: I) \n\nWavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) for the major elements, at Aveiro University, and; \n\n2) Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the measurement of trace elements, at \n\nCNRS, Tolouse. \n\nWDXRF: \n\nWhole-rock major elements were obtained by WDXRF, in Aveiro University facilities, on pressed-\n\npowder pellets, using an Axios Panalytical equipment.  \n\nICP-MS: \n\nWhole rock trace elements concentrations were acquired on a HR-ICP-MS ELEMENT XR at the \n\nG\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse laboratory (Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es), Universit\u00e9 of Toulouse \n\nIII, following the procedure described by Barrat et al. (2007).  Sample preparation consisted of a HF-\n\nHClO4 digestion procedure (Yokoyama et al., 1999) combined with a Tm addition (Barrat et al., 1996). \n\nThe Tm addition allowed the calculation of the trace element compositions based on the Tm positive \n\nanomaly appearing in the samples REE pattern. Therefore, there is no correction for any elemental loss \n\nduring the chemical procedure. Following digestion, samples were diluted and directly analysed to \n\nobtain concentrations all trace elements.  BHVO-2 was used as external standard following the values \n\nproposed by Barrat et al. (2007). The yield was monitored and concentrations calculated using the Tm \n\nanomaly (Barrat et al., 1996). MG-PMS and UBN geostandards were measured using the same \n\nprocedure. Analytical blanks are systematically subtracted to BHVO2 and samples cps. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER IV  \nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: \n\nHYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND \n\nPETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\nIV.1. PETROGRAPHY: TEXTURAL AND MINERALOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION \n\nIn this section, the microscopic textural and mineralogical features are described, using the macroscopic \n\nand microscopic observations and a set of illustrative microphotographs, supplemented by EPMA data. \n\nThe volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos MS deposit comprise a set of basaltic rocks that display \n\nnumerous evidence of regional metasomatic and ore-forming hydrothermal (s.s.) alteration. The textural \n\narrangements of secondary mineral assemblages document the progression of fluid-rock interactions, at \n\ndifferent evolving stages, causing heterogeneous alteration patterns.  \n\nHanging Wall \n\nThe hanging wall rocks comprise a set of coherent facies: massive flows and/or massive flows, with \n\nminor apparent-volcaniclastic/autoclastic facies (see McPhie, 1993), along with basaltic rocks that \n\ndisplay evidence of different stages of alteration.  \n\nMacroscopically, these rocks are classified as fine-grained vesicular microporphyritic basaltic rocks, \n\ndistinguishable by their colours - resulting from differences in mineralogy, due to alteration (s.l.) \n\nphenomena - as well as by the presence of vesicle and their infillings and by the relative size and \n\ndistribution of veinlets.  \n\nOverall, primary textures and, to some extent, primary mineralogy, are well preserved. Clinopyroxene, \n\nminor plagioclase microphenocrysts are set within a fine-grained, microcrystalline plagioclase \n\nmicrolitic-lath matrix, partly replaced by secondary mineral assemblages, with abundant primary iron-\n\ntitanium oxides. \n\nThe microphenocrysts generally occur as clusters or single crystals of euhedral to sub-euhedral \n\nclinopyroxene and minor plagioclase. The clinopyroxene crystals, ~600 \u00b5m to ~1mm in size, do not \n\nshow zoning and are partly to completely replaced by secondary mineral phases, showing evidence for \n\na complex and polyphasic replacement. At first, the clinopyroxene is altered to an amphibole \n\n(actinolite?), which is subsequently altered to chlorite and epidote. Plagioclase phenocrysts are mostly \n\neuhedral, ranging from ~0.5 to ~1mm, and are almost completely replaced by albite; early/primary \n\nplagioclase composition is preserved in patches, and the grains are set in a brownish-greenish \n\nphyllosilicate-rich groundmass.  \n\nSwallow-tailed plagioclase microlites are also found within the phyllosilicate-rich matrix; these \n\nplagioclase microlites and matrix alteration are marked by (I) increase of the albitic component in the \n\nmicrolites (as documented by EPMA, see Chapter IV.2); (II) pervasive phyllosilicate, and minor epidote, \n\nalteration, affecting the matrix and early Fe-Mg silicate phases. Iron and titanium primary oxides \u2013 \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n21 \n\ntitanium-rich magnetite -are found disseminated within the matrix, between the plagioclase microlites, \n\nshowing corroded outer rims, intergrown with secondary small titanite crystals. \n\nThe abundance of vesicles, size and distribution within the volcanic rocks varies and represents the \n\nchannels generated by volatile escape. These vesicles are filled with secondary mineral phases, \n\nprecipitated during alteration processes. Usually they are rimmed by fine-grained phyllosilicates and \n\nfilled with radial aggregates of the same phyllosilicates, quartz, zeolites and/or carbonates. \n\nVolcanic glass was found in two samples, in contact with a basaltic rock; this glass-basaltic rock \n\ninterface corresponds, probably, to a contact between two different lava flows, where the rapid cooling \n\nof the base of the latter inhibited crystallization and, consequently, fostered the formation of volcanic \n\nglass. This volcanic glass shows devitrification textures -\u2013 spherulites \u2013  and aligned vesicles, mostly \n\nfilled with phyllosilicates. The latter are also found replacing the volcanic glass, suggesting that the \n\nbrownish groundmass observed in other volcanic rocks matrix is a result of volcanic glass alteration. \n\nPartly altered clinopyroxene and plagioclase microphenocrysts are also found within the volcanic glass, \n\nas well as hematite sealing microfractures.  \n\nMonomict autoclastic breccia rocks occur within the hanging wall volcanic sequence. These consist of \n\nbasalt pseudo-clasts surrounded by a micro to cryptocrystalline pseudo-matrix, composed of chlorite, \n\nquartz and minor carbonates. Although the primary igneous texture is still recognizable, the basalt \n\npseudo-clasts show evidence of strong alteration: intense albitic replacement, in plagioclase, and strong \n\nphyllosilicates deposition, although preserving relics where the early breakdown of pyroxene into \n\namphibole, preceding the formation of Chl+Ep, can still be seen. The intensity of this alteration increases \n\ntowards the pseudo-matrix, blurring the contact between both; in other cases, the (-pseudo-)clast/matrix \n\ncontact is outlined by late chlorite aggregates or by microfractures filled with carbonates. This reflects \n\nthe distribution of fractures, generated by in-situ fragmentation, allowing an increase in the permeability \n\nand, consequently, an increase in fluid circulation. Thus, these samples might represent the top of \n\nmassive flows/pillow lavas, where quenching favoured fragmentation and fluid circulation. \n\nThe hanging wall volcanic sequence is crosscut by a series of late veinlets, with different mineral infills: \n\n(I) early (calcic) zeolites, with calcite intergrowths; (II) abundant calcite, with minor zeolites, whose \n\ndeposition is correlative with brecciation episodes, possibly synchronous of the late events of vesicle \n\ninfilling; and (III) minor late, fine-grained, chlorite and quartz or carbonate.  \n\nDuring the final stages of carbonate precipitation, hematite occurs, sometimes, developing intergrowths \n\nwith calcite and chlorite. Otherwise, hematite precipitation is controlled by structural discontinuities \n\n(fractures and veins/veinlets) and sometimes its deposition occurs together with microcrystalline \n\nsilica/quartz. Hematite also occurs widely disseminated in the basaltic rocks, transposing the primary \n\ntexture. In these situations, the volcanic primary texture is only recognizable by the occasional presence \n\nof primary clinopyroxene and minor plagioclase microphenocrysts. This pervasive hematitic alteration \n\nis also associated with the deposition of jaspers and umbers, which can be later crisscrossed by \n\nanastomosed carbonate and minor chlorite veins, with associated brecciation. \n\nIt is important to highlight the absence of sulphides in the hanging-wall sequence, whether disseminated \n\nwithin the matrix, vesicles or even in later mineral infills along distinct sets of structural discontinuities \n\nveins/sealing, indicating the absence of mineralizing hydrothermal (s.s.) processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.1. PETROGRAPHY \n\n28 \n\nFootwall \n\nThe footwall volcanic sequence is mostly composed of basaltic rocks, with primary textures almost \n\ncompletely obliterated, documenting an intense and possibly long-lasting alteration process. The only \n\nremnants of the primary mineral assemblage are feldspar microlithic laths. \n\nPlagioclase microlites show skeletal remains of the primary feldspar crystals, with Na-rich cores and, \n\nsometimes, intense quartz neo formation, overgrowing the original microlites and/or replacing them. \n\nFine-grained chlorite aggregates, with bluish-anomalous interference colours, outline probable remnants \n\nof ferromagnesian phases (clinopyroxene). This is accompanied by the precipitation of fine-grained \n\nchlorite and euhedral pyrite crystals, in the rocks matrix; the same paragenesis is found filling vesicles. \n\nNevertheless, this mineral association represents the less intense hydrothermal alteration association \n\n(Chl+Py+Qz) and characterizes the hydrothermal alteration observed in the footwall volcanic rocks \n\nsampled in the drill-cores. The hydrothermal alteration process is more intense when volcanic rocks are \n\nmore vesicular, due to enhanced fluid circulation, induced by earlier high permeability. Thus, volcanic \n\nrocks record variable intensity of silicification and chloritization processes, with Na-rich plagioclase \n\nmicrolites recording also the effects of the early-developed regional alteration stage, as described before \n\n(see hanging-wall). The silicifiation \u00b1 pyritization processes are more pervasive and intense in the \n\nbasaltic rocks recovered from the open pit, where, in extreme cases of hydrothermal alteration, samples \n\nare partly to completely replaced by Qz+Py\u00b1Ccp\u00b1Sph, with greenish, i.e. chloritzed, remnants of the \n\nbasaltic rock and feldspar microlites. These samples are also characterized by an intense brecciation and \n\ninfill by the same mineral association found in the rocks matrix.  \n\nThe hematitic alteration described for the hanging-wall volcanic sequence is also present in the footwall \n\nvolcanic sequence. Hematite-impregnated basalts/jaspers/umbers are present in the \n\nsouthern/southwestern sampled portion of the deposit, affected by the same hydrothermal processes as \n\nthe basaltic rocks, whereas hematite (\u00b1quartz)-bearing veinlets/veins are found throughout the rest of \n\nthe sampled volcanic rocks. Additionally, some hematite veins cut the hydrothermally altered rocks, \n\nespecially noticeable in the open pit samples.  \n\nIn the hematite-altered basaltic rocks, and in jaspers, formed prior to the development of the \n\nhydrothermal system and mineralization, evidence for bleaching processes is seen, adjoining quartz \n\nveins where the reddish hematite coloration becomes weaker or disappears, accompanied by \n\ndissemination of small pyrite crystals. Such relationship indicates iron bleaching/leaching and reduction, \n\nfollowed by minor sulphide precipitation. \n\nFour phases of formation of hydrothermal quartz veins can be identified, some of them evidencing \n\nbrecciation that crosscuts the footwall volcanic sequence, as well as re-opening evidences, suggesting a \n\ntectonic control on the circulation of silica-rich (saturated) hydrothermal fluids. Sometimes, these quartz \n\ncrystals present a mild wavy extinction, revealing sub-granulation, consequence of intra-crystalline \n\nplastic deformation. Occasionally, these hydrothermal veins are found overlapping, evidencing that \n\nthese veins are reactivated/re-opened and, thus, denouncing a structural control on the fluid circulation.  \n\nThe first phase comprises comb-like quartz crystals, and, in the late-stages, chalcopyrite. These are cut \n\nby a second generation of veins, finer grained, granular quartz crystals, pyrite and chalcopyrite; the latter \n\nalso precipitates in microfractures, outlining first-stage pyrite crystals.  \n\nThe third and fourth late quartz generations comprise microcrystalline quartz veinlets/veins, where \n\nmicrocrystalline quartz occurs, sometimes as bands, suggesting that deposition was triggered by rapid \n\ncooling; these bands are subsequently disrupted by an almost orthogonal set of quartz infilled \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n29 \n\nmicrofractures, also with no sulphides associated. These quartz bands sometimes have the same \n\norientation as previously formed veins, which might indicate re-opening of the structures. \n\nLate carbonate veins, with minor pyrite, cut the earlier quartz veins, some of which are reopened and \n\nsealed by Cb+Py. \n\nThe various hydrothermal stages are conspicuous in the more intensely hydrothermally altered rocks \n\n(open pit samples), and in the hematite impregnated and jasper samples (S/SE drill-core samples), with \n\nsilicification and dissemination of Py, sometimes together with Al-rich phyllosilicates. Thus, it is \n\npossible to establish a relative chronological relationship for the different hydrothermal stages. In some \n\ncases, this hydrothermal alteration is epitomized by fine-grained chlorite and/or quartz veins, with \n\nsulphides, pyrite with minor chalcopyrite, bearing veins and by disseminated, sub-microscopical, \n\neuhedral to subhedral apatite crystals. This is possibly related to a structural control of the alteration \n\nprocesses, suggesting that these mineral assemblages and textural arrangements can be used as proxies \n\nto the ore-forming system. In some cases, there is an overlap between more than one hydrothermal \n\nphase, similar to what is observed in the hematite impregnated basalts/jaspers, with the microcrystalline \n\nquartz bands corroding granular quartz and sulphide veins.  \n\nIn samples of the footwall volcanic sequence, fom the open pit, zeolites occur, with quartz, in veins and \n\nas vesicle infills. Such veins clearly cut the volcanic rocks after its weak to moderate hydrothermal \n\nalteration (Py+Qz) and they show evidence of reactivation, with hydrothermal microcrystalline quartz \n\ncrystals. \n\nDoleritic rocks, with well-developed intersertal texture, occur also in the footwall sequence. These rocks \n\ndisplay a primary mineralogy similar to the one found in the hanging-wall rocks, larger (in comparison \n\nto the hanging-wall volcanic rocks) primary iron-titanium oxides grains, and sparse clinopyroxene and \n\nfeldspar microphenocrysts; phyllosilicate-filled vesicles occur sparsely. These doleritic rocks show a \n\npervasive alteration similar to the one described above, with the breakdown of primary Fe-Mg phases \n\nand intense phyllosilicate alteration, demonstrating that these rocks underwent a similar fluid-assisted \n\nalteration process analogous to the one described for the hanging-wall volcanic sequence. Nevertheless, \n\nsome sub-microscopical Py crystals are present, as well as apatite. The presence of such mineral phases \n\nwill be later discussed (see Chapter V). \n\n \n\n \n\nBased on the mineralogical and textural relationships previously described, a paragenetic sequence is \n\ndepicted in Figure IV.8 (see end of section). This is divided into three main alteration stages, the first \n\n(Alteration stage I) comprising the breakdown of primary igneous phases and vesicle and vein infills, \n\nevident on the hanging-wall sequence. The second alteration stage (Alteration stage II), found in both \n\nhanging and footwall rocks consists in a low-temperature hydrothermal alteration, including the \n\nformation of jaspers and/or umbers, and, occasionally coupled with pervasive hematite dissemination, \n\ntransposing the primary igneous textures.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.2. MINERAL CHEMISTRY \n\n39 \n\n \n\nIV.2. MINERAL CHEMISTRY \n\nThis section reports the chemical compositions of the mineral phases, found on the volcanic rocks that \n\nhost the Mandoos massive sulphide. For this, 8 representative thin sections were chosen representing \n\nthe different textural arrangements. This analysis focused on silicates- namely primary phases such as \n\nfeldspars (s.l.) and pyroxenes, or secondary, such as chlorite group minerals, oxides, carbonates, \n\nsulphides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite) and phosphates- apatite. Some of the identified mineral \n\nphases were not analysed due to their small dimensions or because the polishing was not ideal, the \n\nobtained results indicating the effects of contamination from the adjacent mineral grain; that was often \n\nthe case of titanite, hematite or magnetite. The data management and processing was based on the \n\nprevious petrographic characterization and it consisted on the confirmation of the mineral phases, \n\nensuring that the EPMA analysis were valid and consistent with the mineral stoichiometry. The results \n\nof this detailed mineralogical characterization will contribute to constrain geochemistry-based models \n\nfor the geological evolution these volcanic rocks and related ore forming processes. \n\nIV.2.1. SILICATES \n\nSilicates form most primary and secondary mineral phases in volcanic rocks, both in the hanging and \n\nfootwall rocks. They include pyroxene, feldspar, chlorite minerals, zeolite group minerals, with some \n\nunidentified phyllosilicates. \n\nIV.2.1.a. PYROXENES  \n\nIn order to characterize the compositional variability of the pyroxene microphenocrysts found in the \n\nhanging-wall volcanic rocks, 71 analyses were performed, in three polished sections (see Appendix IV). \n\nTheir study followed the recommendations of the pyroxenes CNMMN-IMA subcommittee (Miromoto \n\net al., 1988).  \n\nThe general group formula is given as ?2(?2+)?1(?2+)?2(2?\n4+)?6, in which T represents the \n\ntetrahedral position, occupied by Si and Al, and M1 and M2 the octahedral coordination positions, where \n\ndivalent (?2+) cations are present (Morimoto et al.,1988).  \n\nThe discriminating J-Q diagram (Morimoto et al., 1988) (Figure IV.7), show that all the analysed \n\npyroxenes fall into the \u201cquadrilateral\u201d chemical group field, i.e. they have Ca, Mg and Fe as major \n\ncomponents, displaying also a strong compositional homogeneity. Following the recommendations \n\nproposed by Moritomo et al., (1988), the use of the Mg2Si2O6 (enstatite) \u2013 Fe2\n2+\n\nSi2O6 (ferrosilite) \u2013 \n\nCaMgSi2O6 (diopside) \u2013 CaFe\n2+\n\nSi2O6 (hedenbergite) quadrilateral system allows a chemical \n\nclassification and the evaluation of the variation in the chemical compositions, where the solid solution \n\nend-members for Ca-Mg-Fe quadrilateral pyroxenes are expressed in % of enstatite \n\n(En%=100Mg/(Ca+Mg+?Fe), wollastonite (Wo%= 100Ca/Ca+Mg+ ?Fe ) and ferrosilite (Fs%= 100 \n\n?Fe/Ca+ Mg+?Fe), where ?Fe = Fe\n2+\n\n+Fe\n3\n, including also Mn. \n\nThe available data fall within the augitic clinopyroxene compositional field, with an average chemical \n\nformula En39-54Wo27-43Fs8-23. These pyroxenes are also characterized by low Al and Ti contents (1.22-\n\n4.02; 0.07-0.41 wt%, respectively), typical of tholeiitic rocks (BVSP\n1\n, 1981). Additionally, Cr contents \n\nare also low (0.06-1.11 wt%).  \n\n                                                            \n1 BVSP- Basalt Volcanism Study Project \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nIV.2.1.b. FELDSPARS \n\nFeldspar (s.l.) crystals are the most common primary mineral phase, occurring as minor euhedral \n\nmicrophenocrysts and, most commonly, as microlites in the groundmass of volcanic rocks. Its chemical \n\ncomposition variation were examined on the basis of 125 analyses in 5 thin sections (see Appendix V). \n\nThe feldspar group are tectosilicates with general formula MT4O8, where T is occupied either by Si\n4+ \n\nor \n\nAl\n3+\n\n cations; the M position is occupied by Ca\n2+\n\n, Na\n+\n and/or K+, allowing an incomplete solid solution \n\nbetween albite (NaAlSi3O8), anorthite (CaAl2Si3O8) and K-feldspar (KAlSi3O8) (Deer et al., 2008). \n\nThus, a compositional classification can be made, using the relative percentage of the three end-members \n\n(An%, Ab% or Or%; Figure IV.7). \n\nThe analysed feldspars belong to the plagioclase series, i.e. with less than 10% Or%, with two main \n\ncompositional groups, spanning from Ca-rich terms to Na-rich phases: the first comprises the primary \n\nplagioclase compositions, falling within the bytownite and labradorite compositional field, reflecting a \n\nprimary Ca-rich plagioclase. Primary plagioclases are still found in relic patches within \n\nmicrophenocrysts (An70.1-84.9) and microlites (An61.3-71.1). The second compositional group is \n\ncharacterized by plagioclase with a higher albitic component (Ab84.7-99.5). This represents the altered \n\nportion of the feldspar phenocrysts and microlites, in which there is a sodium incorporation, leaving \n\ncores of Ca-rich primary plagioclase (Figure IV.8).  \n\nFigure IV.7- Pyroxene classification diagrams: Q-J discriminating diagram and the Compositional diagram for quadrilateral \n\npyroxenes, following the recommendations of the pyroxenes CNMMN-IMA subcommittee (Morimoto et al., 1988). \n\n\n\nIV. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.2. MINERAL CHEMISTRY \n\n41 \n\n \n\nIV.2.1.c. CHLORITE GROUP \n\nChlorite-group minerals are abundant throughout the whole volcanic sequence, having formed in the \n\ndifferent alteration stages and found in different textural contexts (see Chapter IV.1). Its chemical \n\nvariability was studied; 16 valid analyses were obtained, in 1 polished sections, belonging to the footwall \n\nvolcanic sequence, sampled through the drill-cores (see Appendix VI). Due to the poor polishing of the \n\npolished thin sections, as previously mentioned, most of the performed analysis were considered as not-\n\nvalid. Additionally, only the chlorite crystals found as vesicle infills exhibited appropriate dimensions \n\nand polishing to obtain acceptable analytical results. \n\nChlorites are characterized by a wide range of compositions, with a general crystallchemical formula \n\n(??\n2+??\n\n3+[  ]? )\n?? (??4?? ???\n\n3+)?? ?10(??)8, where the ?\n2+ position is usually occupied by Mg, Fe\n\n2+\n, Mn, \n\nNi, Zn and ?3+ by Al, Fe3+ and Cr; u+y+z=6 and z=((y-w-x))?2 and [  ] represents octahedral structural \n\nvacancies (Caritat et al., 1993). Chlorite structure is characterized by alternating octahedral-positive \n\nbrucite layers and tetrahedral-octahedral-negative talc-like layers in 2:1 proportion (Caritat et al., 1993). \n\nThe analysed chlorite grains are characterized by a wide variability of SiO2 Al2O3 and MgO, with Ti and \n\nCr as main trace elements. \n\nThe compositional variability of chlorite minerals can be explained by three substitution processes. I) \n\nthe most common substitution found in chlorite minerals, the Tschermak exchange/substitution (TK), \n\nconsists in the redistribution of charges between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, but maintaining the \n\noverall charge balance given by ???? ???? (??, ??2+)?1\n?? ???1\n\n?? , ???? (??3+)?? ???1\n?? (??, ??2+)?1\n\n??  and \n\n??2\n?? (??4+)?? ???2\n\n?? (??, ??2+)?1\n?? ; II) the di-octahedral substitution (AM), which creates octahedral \n\nstructural vacancies, given by ???? ???? [  ]?? (??, ??2+)?2\n?? ; and III) the FM substitution, given by \n\n?????1 (Zane et al., 1988).  \n\nIn most of the analysed chlorites almost no Fe\n3+ \n\nis present. It is also interesting to note that there is a \n\npositive correlation between (Al+2Ti+Cr)\nVI \n\n- Al\nIV\n\n vs ? ?? (Figure IV.9 [A]), highlighting the influence \n\nof the TK substitution in the chlorites composition. Furthermore, the positive correlation between \n\nFigure IV.8- Triangular compositional diagram for feldspars based on An%, Ab% and Or% (adapted from Deer et al., \n\n2008).

Thus, these common \n\nsubstitutions cause deviations from the chlinochlore-chamosite compositions \n\n[(Mg5Al)(Si3AlO10)(OH)8], to more sudoitic compositions (Figure IV.19 [D]). \n\nChlorites chemical composition is recognized to be influenced by temperature, pressure and other \n\nphysical-chemical parameters, hance its use as proxies for inferring such conditions, especially \n\nregarding the temperatures at which the mineral was formed. Thus, the chemical composition of chlorite \n\nserves as basis of several geothermometers; these can be divided into two different groups: I) empirical \n\ngeothermometers, initially proposed by Cathelineau and Nieva (1985) and Cathelineau (1988), and later \n\nupdated by several other authors, accounting for the cation exchanges between octahedral positions, \n\nproducing better results (Jowett, 1991; Kranidontis &amp; MacLean, 1987). They are based on the empirical \n\nrelationship between ????  with temperature, based on observations for present-day active geothermal \n\nsystems. Thus, these empirical models are often flawd, since they are only valid for minerals formed in \n\nequilibrium with the fluid, posing problems to long-lived and multistage paleo-systems. Additionally, \n\nsome authors denote that the use of empirical geothermometers do not consider the bulk-rock \n\ncomposition as a factor controlling chlorites chemical composition (Bourdelle et al., 2013); and II) \n\n(semi-)thermodynamic-based geothermometers, which offer better and more precise results, considering \n\nother parameters that control chlorites chemical composition. However, there are some uncertainties in \n\nthese models, regarding the P-T data for the calibration of these models, innacuracies of the \n\nthermodynamic properties of chlorite solid-solution models and difficulties in the measurement of \n\nFe\n3+\n\nand accounting for it in the solid-solution models. Nevertheless, various models with a (semi-\n\n)thermodynamic base have been proposed (e.g. Walshe, 1986; Inoue et al., 2009; Bourdelle et al., 2013). \n\nThus, for the calculation of the temperature of chlorite formation, the calculations were made using the \n\nabove mentioned geothermometers (Figure IV.9 [E]). The Jowett (1991) and Bourdelle et al. (2013) \n\nempirical and thermodynamic-based geothermometers, respectively, were chosen as the most \n\nappropriate ones: the first - Jowett\u2019s empirical model \u2013 due to the fact it offers the best approximation \n\nand better results, for empirical geothermometers, while the use of Bourdelle et al., (2013) (semi-\n\n)thermodynamic-based geothermometer was used considering it accounts for the whole-rock \n\ncomposition as controlling factor for chlorites composition. The analyses of the temperatures obtained \n\nsuggests that these chlorites precipitated from hydrothermal fluids at temperatures between 195 to \n\n~430\u00baC; the temperature data distribution is highly assymetrical, hence instead of the average, the \n\nappropriate measure of central tendency is the median, obtaining a T of 273\u00baC\u00b113 \u00baC. It is also possible \n\nto conclude that the empirical approach yielded the highest values for chlorites, opposed to the (semi-\n\n)thermodynamic-based geothermometer, which produced lower temperatures (Figure IV.9 [F]). It is \n\nthen plausible to ascertain that the temperatures obtained for the empirical geothermometers can be \n\nconsidered as the maxmium temperatures for chlorite formation and the thermodynamic-based ones \n\nallow to obtain the minimum temperatures for chlorite formation, for the same chlorite crystal. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIV.

INTERLAYERED CHLORITE-SMECTITE (CHL-SME) \n\nInterlayered chlorite-smectite are 1:1 mixed-layer chlorite-smectite and/or chlorite-vermiculite. They \n\nare, by far, one of the dominant type of natural interlayereds that occur in natural systems, in low to high \n\ntemperature conditions, in evaporitic deposits, soils, sedimentary and volcanic rocks, as well as in burial \n\ndiagenetic processes, in fossil or active hydrothermal systems and even in contact or low-grade regional \n\nmetamorphism. In the literature, the overall given chemical formula for interlayered Chl-Sme is \n\n(??, ??, ?)1?? (??, ??, ??)9?20(??)10 ? ??2?. \n\nUsually identified by X-Ray Diffractometry, the interlayered phyllosilicates in the present study were \n\nidentified on the basis of their expansive properties and chemical composition of:  \n\n(??, ??, ?)0.141(??6.00, ??2.66, ??0.76) (??6.00, ??1.99)8?20(??)10 ? ??2? (See appendix VII). \n\nIV.2.1.e. ALUMINIUM RICH-PHYLLOSILICATES \n\nIn the open pit samples, where volcanic rocks exhibit more intense silicification processes, Al-rich \n\nphyllosilicates are found, together with quartz and pyrite, occurring as fine-grained aggregates. Their \n\nchemical composition is characterized by low amounts of Mg and Fe, besides Si and Al. (see Appendix \n\nVIII). The chemical analyses of these phyllosilicates were recalculated on a 9 and 12 oxygens base, but \n\nthey failed to adjust to a specific aluminium phyllosilicate stoichiometry such as illite, montmorillonite, \n\nhalloysite or kaolinite.  \n\nIV.2.1.f. ZEOLITES \n\nZeolites are found as secondary mineral phases, filling vesicles or sealing veinlets, along with calcite, \n\nduring the first alteration stages. For the study of their chemical variability, 150 analyses were \n\nperformed, in 4 polished sections, one from the hanging-wall and three from the footwall. Zeolite-group \n\nminerals are hydrated aluminium silicates with open framework of linked (Si,Al)O4 tetrahedra. This \n\nframework contains cavities, which are occupied by H2O molecules and non-framework cations; non-\n\nbridging anions can be protonated, becoming OH\n-\n, or altogether substituted by F\n\n-\n (Armbruster and \n\nGunter, 2001).  \n\nThe analysed grains are calcic zeolites, with little or no potassium and/or sodium. Although it is possible \n\nto distinguish different zeolites, based on the chemical analyses alone, it was not possible to assign these \n\nre-calculated analyses to a specific calcic zeolite stoichiometry, e.g. laumontite, stellerite, scolecite, \n\nwairakite or epistilbite. This can be interpreted as analytical inacuracy related to volatilization of light-\n\nweight components under the electron beam (Campbell et al., 2016). Nonetheless, two groups of analysis \n\ncan be matched to coincide with epistilbite and laumontite\u2019s stoichiometry, with reasonable confidence \n\n(Appendix IX). \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIV.

CARBONATES \n\nCarbonates, together with zeolites, hematite and chlorite, trace the late stages of the first alteration \n\nepisode and/or the transition to the second; they occur as well in later re-opening of previous Qz+Py \n\nveins, together with pyrite, in the hydrothermal (s.s.) mineralizing stage. A total of 129 analyses were \n\nperformed in 3 different polished sections, one belonging to the hanging-wall and two from the footwall \n\nrocks (see Appendix X). The analyses reveal a strong compositional homogeneity, around calcite ideal \n\ncomposition, around (Ca1.76?1.96)??3. Mn occurs as trace-element but no difference was found \n\nbetween Mn contents for hanging-wall vs footwall rocks and open-pit vs drill-core samples, despite the \n\ndifferent textural contexts and the different precipitation episodes. \n\nIV.2.3. SULPHIDES \n\nSulphides are absent throughout the hanging-wall volcanic sequence, but are relatively common mineral \n\nphases within the footwall volcanic rocks. A total of 305 analyses were performed: 220 in pyrite crystals, \n\n77 in chalcopyrite and 15 in sphalerite grains (Table IV.I). \n\nAll analysed pyrite crystals are found to have a homogeneous chemical composition, similar to the ideal \n\npyrite chemical formula ???2, with ??0.96?0.99?1.97?2.05, showing trace amounts of Co and, sometimes, \n\nCu and Sb. This applies to all analysed pyrite crystal, regardless of all the different textural contexts: \n\nmatrix, vesicles and the different pyrite hydrothermal precipitation phases. \n\nThe 82 chalcopyrite analyses also revealed a strong compositional homogeneity, close to the ideal \n\ncomposition of this mineral phase. The average composition is given as ??0.98??0.99?2, with systematic \n\ntrace amounts of Mo, Zn and Co, and occasional trace amounts of In, Cd, Ag, Pb, As and Se.  \n\nFigure IV.10- CaCO3-MgCO3-FeCO3 ternary plot with the carbonate analyses from veins and vesicles found in the volcanic \n\nrocks. \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nSphalerite crystals, occurring as (sub)euhedral grains in quartz + pyrite veins and disseminated within \n\nthe matrix, exhibited a predominance of the sphaleritic component (i.e. Zn-rich), with average \n\ncomposition of ??0.95??0.03?1, showing trace amounts of Cu. \n\n \n\nPyrite \n\nn = 221 Average Median Std-Dev Min.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.2. MINERAL CHEMISTRY \n\n47 \n\n \n\nIV.2.4. PHOSPHATES \n\nApatite occurs as an accessory mineral phase in hydrothermally (s.s.) altered volcanic rocks, as small \n\ncrystals, disseminated within the rocks matrix and also in the doleritic rocks. The ideal composition of \n\napatite is ??5(??4)3(?, ??, ??), where Ca can be replaced either by monovalent cations, with loss of \n\nF, OH or Cl, thus developing structural vacancies, or by other divalent cations, or even by trivalent \n\ncations, with substitution of P by tetravalent anions (Deer et al., 2001).  \n\nThe 9 analysed apatite grains are classified as fluorapatites with a chemical composition of \n\n??4.69?5.05(??4)2.97?3.12?0.42?0.79??0.1625?0.435??0.018?0.194, with Fe, Mg and Na occurring as trace \n\nelements (see Appendix XI).  \n\nNevertheless, and despite the limited amount of analyses, the fluorapatites analysed in the doleritic rocks \n\nare characterized by higher median values of Cl\n-\n (0.16 apuf), when compared to the hydrothermally \n\naltered rocks (0.05 apuf); the latter also show higher OH\n-\n contents (0.35 apuf), comparing to the doleritic \n\nrocks apatites (0.31 apuf). \n\nIV.2.5. OXIDES \n\nIron oxides occur as primary mineral phases in the volcanic rocks (magnetite), as euhedral crystals, \n\nsometimes with corroded cores and preserved rims, dispersed within the volcanic rocks groundmass, or \n\nas a secondary mineral phase, sealing veins and microfractures (hematite). As previously mentioned, \n\ndue to poor polishing, analyses of secondary oxides had to be rejected. \n\nThese magnetite crystals are characterized by considerable amounts of Ti and Al, with Mn and Mg as \n\ntrace elements (see Appendix XII). The magnetite analyses were recalculated on a 4-oxygen base but \n\nmagnetite stoichiometry was not obtained, possibly due the low total elemental oxides- lower than \n\n94.35%., conceivably due to poor polishing conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n48 \n\nIV.3. WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY \n\nA total of fourty one samples, nineteen from the hanging-wall and twenty-two from the footwall, \n\nrepresentative of the different alteration facies found throughout the volcanic sequence were chosen, for \n\nmajor and trace element analysis, with the purpose of characterizing the range of geochemical variability \n\nof the volcanic rocks, considering the above-mentioned aims for this study (Appendix XIII)  \n\nA correlation matrix, for the major and trace element data was computed and the correlation values (r) \n\nwere considered as i) linear, very good if |r| > 0.95 (for positive and negative correlations); ii) good if \n\n0.8 ? |r| &lt;0.95, both positive and negative linear correlations, but with some deviations and iii) |r| values \n\nbetween 0.75 and 0.8, as probable linear (positive and negative) correlations.  \n\nExpected results were obtained: no significant negative correlations were found, the most important \n\npositive correlations are as follows, Zn and Cd are found to have a very good correlation, as well as Sb \n\nwith As. Y establishes a very good correlation with the HREE, Zr with Hf and Th and Nb with Ta. Also, \n\nthe HREE show very good correlations amongst themselves and good correlaions with LREE. P2O5 \n\ncovaries positively with Nb, Ta and LREE, while K and Ba are characterized by having good linear \n\ncorrelations between the two. Cu develops good correlations with As, Ge, Mo, Cd and Tl; while Zn has \n\na good correlation with U. Titanium establishes good correlations with Th, Zr, Nb and with most of the \n\nREEs, Zr with the REEs and Th, Cr with Ni, Co with Se, As with Tl and Pb, Ag with In, Sb, Tl and Pb; \n\nCd with U. \n\nIV.3.1. MAJOR ELEMENTS \n\nThe major element geochemistry data is presented in Harker Diagrams, where Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, CaO, \n\nNa2O, K2O, TiO2 and P2O5 have been plotted against SiO2 (Figure IV.10 (I) and (II)).  \n\nThe Al2O3 vs SiO2 plot shows that most of the hanging-wall samples follow a negative linear trend, with \n\nsome dispersion, following a decrease in SiO2 contents and Al2O3 enrichments tendency. This is related \n\nto the low magmatic differentiation, possibly enhanced during oceanic metasomatic alteration but also \n\nattributed to the formation of secondary Al-bearing mineral phases in more intensely altered footwall \n\nsamples. Despite this, the difference between the previously described trend, for the hanging-wall and \n\nthis, lies in the distinct nature of the alteration processes that affect the two groups: while oceanic \n\nmetasomatism consists mainly in phyllosilicate formation, therefore there is an increase in aluminium \n\ncontents, the hydrothermal alteration that affects footwall rocks is characterized not only by chlorite \n\nprecipitation but with variable silicification processes, causing an increase in SiO2. One sample deviates \n\nconsiderably from these two trends, with lower Al2O3 values and high SiO2 contents and it corresponds \n\nto a jasper sample, formed during exhalative hydrothermal activity. The plot of Na2O vs SiO2 shows a \n\nrelative linear correlation, with increase of Na2O accompanied by gains in SiO2, related to the \n\nalbitization of the feldspar microlites and microphenocrysts, during oceanic metassomatic alteration and \n\nalso preserved in some footwall volcanic rocks. As for the plot K2O vs SiO2, no linear correlation is \n\nfound, with large dispersions found for the hanging and footwall samples. \n\nIn the Fe2O3 tot vs SiO2 plot it is also possible to distinguish an inverse linear trend, defined by the \n\nhanging-wall and footwall samples; one of the footwall volcanic rocks is characterized by significantly \n\nhigher contents in Fe2O3tot, possibly related to more intense hydrothermal alteration, possibly related to \n\npyritization processes. The exhalate sample thas a considerable increase in Fe2O3 due to the abundance \n\nof iron oxi-hydroxides. Regarding the CaO vs SiO2 plot, the hanging-wall samples also follow an inverse \n\ncompositional linear trend, with some of the samples of this group defining another trend, characterized \n\nby lower CaO contents. Even lower CaO values characterize the footwall samples and the jasper sample. \n\n\n\nIV. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.3. WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY \n\n49 \n\nThe trend observed for the hanging-wall samples possibly reflects magmatic trend for these rocks, where \n\nthe alteration of Cpx and the albitization of the plagioclase was possibly compensated by the neo-\n\nformation of secondary Ca bearing mineral phases, such as epidote, carbonates and zeolites, during \n\noceanic metasomatism. For the footwall volcanic rocks, the Ca contents are significantly lower, due to \n\nhydrothermal leaching, which produces rocks with few Ca-bearing mineral phases. The MgO vs SiO2 \n\ncan be characterized using a similar reasoning: the recognizable trend reflects magmatic differentiation \n\ntendency, where the precipitation and neo-formation of Mg bearing minerals (e.g. chlorite) explains why \n\nboth hanging and footwall rocks follow the same trend. \n\nThe P2O5 vs SiO2 and MnO vs SiO2 plots are fairly similar: overall low P and Mn values, for both \n\nhanging and footwall volcanic rocks, with significant increases in P and Mn in the jasper sample. The \n\nplot of TiO2 vs SiO2 reveals two distinct trends: one with the increase of TiO2 with SiO2, mostly recorded \n\nby the hanging wall samples, and likely related to magmatic differentiation and Ti-magnetite formation, \n\nand a second trend, observed for the footwall and some hanging-wall volcanic rocks, characterized by \n\ndecreases in TiO2, possibly related to those oxides alteration during progressive alteration.   \n\nFigure IV.11 (I)- Harker diagrams correlating Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3and K2O vs. SiO2, for hanging wall samples (open circles) \n\nand footwall volcanic rocks (filled circles).

WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY \n\n51 \n\nIV.3.2. MINOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS \n\nMinor and trace elements occur in the primary mineral phases structure and some of them are found to \n\nhave immobile behaviour during alteration. In this section, the variation of minor and trace elements \n\nwill be assessed, using I) REE patterns, and II) Spider diagrams. Some lithogeochemical indices will \n\nalso be used, to evaluate the relationship between mineralogical and geochemical data, thus providing a \n\nqualitative interpretation of the alteration degree these rocks underwent, as well as a basis for mass \n\nbalance calculations. \n\n  IV.3.2.2. C1-NORMALIZED REE  \n\nFor the C1\n2\n chondrite-normalized REE plots (Figure IV.11), samples were grouped according the \n\nintensity of the alteration exhibited, and the Eu* and Ce anomalies were calculated. The first is \n\ncalculated using the expression ?? ???? = ??? (??? \u00d7??? )\n0.5? , and it measures the depletion or \n\nenrichment, relative to Sm and Gd. The Ce anomaly measures its enrichment or depletion in relation to \n\nLa and Sm, and (?? ?? ?? = 5??? (4??? + ??? )? ), being negative when its value is lower than 1. \n\nREE patterns for hanging-wall volcanic rock samples (Figure IV.11 [A]), exhibiting only evidence of \n\noceanic metasomatic alteration, are characterized by a LREE (~3 to 20\u00d7 C1) depletion, relative to HREE \n\n(7 to ~30\u00d7 C1) \u2013 (L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,3, an increasing LREE segment and a relative flat HREE pattern. Two \n\nsamples display a mild negative Eu anomaly, otherwise the Eu anomaly is absent (Eu*= 0,804 to 1,097). \n\nThe samples are, overall, characterized by a negative Ce anomaly, expcet for two samples (Ce* = 1.00 \n\nand 1.09), with values spanning from 0.80 to 0.99. Overall, whithin this group it is possible to distinguish \n\ntwo sub-groups: one with higher bulk REE and, the other characterized by significantly lower bulk \n\ncontents. \n\nThe second group is composed of the footwall volcanic rock samples which show a lower hydrothermal \n\nalteration (dissemination of pyrite, incipient chloritization and/or silicification) with common oceanic \n\nmetasomatic alteration evidences, as a well as the low-T hydrothermal episode (hematite-bearing veins) \n\n(Figure IV.11 [B]). They show a REE pattern similar to the first group, differing on a less steep slope \n\nof the LREE segment and lower LREE/HREE fractionation ((L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,71), although, as a group, \n\nthe REE contents are higher than the first group. Some samples exhibit a negative Ce (0,826 and 0,847) \n\nand Eu anomaly, in spite of positive-sloped LREE segments. \n\nThe third group (Figure IV.11 [C]) comprises the footwall samples that show the most intense \n\nhydrothermal alteration (moderate to intense silicification, chloritization and pyrite dissemination) and \n\nconsequently the widest range of variation in their REE patterns (see also Figure IV.12 [C]). The \n\nfractionation between LREE and HREE becomes less pronounced ((L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,693), sometimes \n\nwith mild LREE/HREE enrichments. The Eu anomaly becomes more pronounced, being positive in the \n\ncase of two samples (MD-P2-4-1 and MD-P2-4-2), which also show the lowest bulk REE \n\nconcentrations.  \n\nThe typicalREE compositions of N-MORB, E-MORB, OIB, BAAB and, more specifically, Lau Basin\u2019s \n\nbasaltic rocks REE compositions were added (Figure IV.11 [D]) for comparison.  \n\nThe studied REE patterns are characterized by overall REE depletions, low LREE/HREE, Eu and, in \n\nsome cases, Ce anomalies. These rocks REE contents are consistent from being relatively evolved, \n\nderivate liquids from gabbroic rocks, in which plagioclase crystallized, having retained the Eu. They are \n\n                                                            \n2 C1 Chondrite data from Palme et al.

Additionally, alteration processes are \n\nalso responsible for REE contents modifications such as bulk REE decrease and development of Ce \n\nnegative anomalies, which indicate that REE were mobile during both sea-water regional alteration, as \n\nwell as during hydrothermal alteration. Additionally, the positive Eu anomaly, seen in the more \n\nhydrothermally altered samples, translate a direct influence of hydrothermal fluids, typically \n\ncharacterized by such Eu anomalies. \n\n \n\n \nHanging-wall \n\nn= 19 Average Median Std-Dev Min Max \n\nLa/Sm 0.522 0.527 0.07 0.417 0.624 \n\nCe/Ce* 0.928 0.939 0.067 0.804 1.097 \n\nEu/Eu* 0.899 0.917 0.055 0.798 0.963 \n\n(La/Lu)CN 0.419 0.399 0.110 0.204 0.597 \n\n(La/Yb)CN 0.423 0.422 0.105 0.212 0.598 \n\n(La/Nd)CN 0.596 0.602 0.052 0.523 0.679 \n\n(Sm/Yb)CN 0.804 0.804 0.130 0.493 1.017 \n\nFootwall \n\nn= 22 Average Median Std-Dev Min Max \n\nLa/Sm 0.685 0.596 0.056 0.419 1.273 \n\nCe/Ce* 0.953 0.999 0.144 0.624 1.129 \n\nEu/Eu* 0.847 0.876 0.254 0.482 1.494 \n\n(La/Lu)CN 0.675 0.667 0.247 0.267 1.141 \n\n(La/Yb)CN 0.672 0.682 0.244 0.270 1.171 \n\n(La/Nd) CN 0.680 0.617 0.163 0.488 1.049 \n\n(Sm/Yb)CN 0.979 0.958 0.202 0.629 1.331 \n\nTable IV.2- REE ratios for the Hanging and Footwall volcanic rocks \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n53 \n\n  \n\nFigure IV.12- C1-normalized REE distributions, following the same grouping as previously \n\nmentioned: [A] hanging wall volcanic rocks; [B] footwall volcanic rocks that exhibit weak \n\nhydrothermal alteration; [D] footwall volcanic rocks that exhibit moderate to intense \n\nhydrothermal alteration; In [D], other patterns were plotted for comparison: orange \u2013 OIB; \n\nyellow \u2013 E-MORB; red \u2013 N-MORB; blue \u2013 Tonga back-arc; light green \u2013 BABB. \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n54 \n\nIV.3.2.2. SPIDER DIAGRAMS  \n\nRepresentation of the different elements follows the increasing atomic number growth, from left to right, \n\nand samples were PM-normalized. They were also grouped according to the criteria previously defined: \n\nthe first group of samples corresponds to the hanging wall rocks that chiefly display the effects of \n\noceanic metasomatism. The two other groups comprise footwall samples: the second group comprises \n\nvolcanic rocks with weak hydrothermal alteration, while the third is composed of samples which show \n\nevidence of more intense and pervasive alteration. This allows the distinction of the geochemical \n\nsignatures and their correlation with each alteration episode. \n\nFigure IV.12 [A] shows that the hanging-wall volcanic rock samples, which exhibit only oceanic \n\nmetasomatic alteration, show very similar and consistent patterns, with low P values (0.2 to 2\u00d7 PM), \n\nCu and Zn (~1\u00d7 PM), a positive low-Ti anomaly (2 to 5\u00d7 PM) and moderate K (3 to ~12\u00d7 PM) As (~8 \n\nto ~150\u00d7 PM), Sb (3 to ~16\u00d7 PM), and Bi (~5\u00d7 PM) enrichments, as well as Pb (3 to ~17\u00d7 PM) and \n\nU (from ~1 to 10\u00d7 PM). Elements such as Rb, Sr, Ba and REE are also characterized by 1-10xPM \n\nvariations. Conversely, the multi-elemental patterns for these rocks are marked by deep Cr, Ni and Cs \n\nnegative anomalies, with lower-magnitude \u2013 and sometimes more variable \u2013 Co, Nb, Ta and Th negative \n\nanomalies, relatively to the PM.  \n\nFor the second group (Figure IV.12 [B]), which consists in samples that show evidences of oceanic \n\nmetassomatic alteration (mostly albitized plagioclase), some evidences of the low-T hydrothermal event \n\n(hematite veins) and of hydrothermal mineralization (disseminated pyrite and incipient to moderate \n\nsilification), the patterns are characterized by identical titanium concentrations (in relation to the first \n\ngroup), similar low concentrations in K, P, Cr, Ni and Cs and a substantial variation, i.e. enrichment, in \n\nZn (4 to 60 \u00d7 PM), Cu (2 to 20 \u00d7 PM), As (~70 to 1000\u00d7 PM), Cd (~2 to 8\u00d7 PM), Sb (~7 to 100\u00d7 PM), \n\nPb (~5 to 50\u00d7 PM) and U (~4 to ~17\u00d7 PM). \n\nThe patterns for the more hydrothermally altered samples (figure IV.12 [C]) show a slightly wider range \n\nof variations, for a given element in comparison to the samples pictured in [B]. Ti and P values and the \n\nCs negative anomaly are also similar to the one described for the previous groups and the positive \n\nanomalies evident in the preceding diagrams are present \u2013 for K, As, Sb, Ba, Pb, Bi and U \u2013 although \n\nthey show a broader range of variation: in the case of Ti, the positive anomaly decreases, whereas Cs, \n\nZr and Nb (and, to some extent, Ta) anomlalies become more negative, relative to PM values. Cu, Co, \n\nAs, In, Sb, Pb and U increase prominently in samples that show more intense hydrothermal alteration. \n\nThe two samples with the highest As, Cu and Pb enrichment and the most depleted Sc, Ti, Rb, Nb and \n\nREE concentrations, show pervasive silicification and pyritization with only small remnants of a \n\nthoroughly chloritized basalt. The sample with the second highest As, Cu and Pb concentrations \n\ncoincides with the jasper sample, cut by mineralized hydrothermal veins, with Qz, Py and Ccp.  \n\nSpider N-MORB-normalized diagrams were not made, although it is a common practice, since they are \n\nnot found to be useful, as the MORB \u201cgroup\u201d (N-MORB, E-MORB, T-MORB suites) trace elements \n\nabundances constitute a complete continuum spectrum of compositions, spanning from the more \n\ndepleted MORB\u2019s to OIB-like REE contents (Hofmann, 2014).  \n\nThe mild positive Ti anomaly, together with the negative Co, Ni, Cs and Cr anomalies translate primary \n\nmagmatic trends and are compatible with a basaltic melt, extracted from a MORB-like mantle source; \n\nthe detailed affiliation of these volcanic series will be further explored in section IV.5. These patterns \n\nalso reveal that the rocks hosting the Mandoos deposit experienced several trace-element compositional \n\nmodifications, during the different stages of alteration.  The U, Pb and As positive anomalies, as well as \n\nthose observed for Sb, Rb and Sr are most likely the result of sea-water induced regional alteration \n\n\n\nIV.

ALTERATION INDEXES \n\nThe volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos massive sulphide deposit record mineralogical and \n\ncompositional modifications attributed to different, and superimposed, alteration stages, not all of them \n\nrelated with hydrothermal ore forming processes. To geochemically differentiate among the various \n\nalteration stages, Large et al., (2001) proposed the use of a plot that relates mineralogical transformations \n\nwith geochemical data and the gain/loss of particular elements, during these alteration processes. This \n\nallows the distinction between alteration stages with metallogenetic significance and regional, \n\ndiagenetic trends. Two indices are proposed: the AI (Ishikawa Alteration Index) and the CCPI (chlorite-\n\ncarbonate-pyrite index), each each related with typical mineral assemblages associated with both \n\nregional/diagenetic processes (e.g. feldspar hydrolysis and albitization during widespread oceanic \n\nmetasomatism) and ore-forming hydrotermal events (e.g. chloritization and pyritization of volcanic \n\nrocks, closer to the mineralization).  \n\n?? =\n100(?2? + ???)\n\n(?2? + ??? + ??2? + ???)\n \n\n???? =\n100(??? + ???)\n\n(??? + ??? + ??2? + ?2?)\n \n\nThe Mandoos samples in this diagram (Figure IV.16) define a clear trend for some samples related with \n\nthe following compositional modifications: i) chlorite and pyrite (trend 3); ii) carbonate \u00b1 sericite (trend \n\n5) for the hydrothermal trends. As for the diagenetic trends, it is possible to identify the albite-chlorite \n\n(trend 7) and albite-chlorite-epidote (trend 8) mineral associations. Some dispersions are also observed, \n\nsimulating other compositional tendencies, such as the diagenetic trend 9, possibly resulting from the \n\ncombination of other two, such as the trend 5 and 7. Despite this, there are numerous samples that fall \n\nwithin the least altered box, even those that show pervasive hydrothermal alteration. This may be due \n\nto the superimposed alteration phenomena: e.g. first, a diagenetic trend such as 7 and afterwards, \n\nhydrothermal ore-forming alteration that follows vector 5.  \n\n\n\nIV.

WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY \n\n57 \n\nThe use of major and trace alteration indices proposed by H\u00e4ussinger (1993), together withtogether with \n\nAI and CCPI (Large et al., 2001) can be a useful tool in exploration surveys, as they discriminate \n\ndifferent compositional trends, associated to: a) widespread regional alteration effects (Field III); b) \n\ndiffuse and exhalative hydrothermal activity- without associated mineralization (Field I); and c) \n\ncompositional modifications associated to ore-forming hydrothermal systems (Field II). This has been \n\nsuccessfully applied by other authors in different VMS metallogenetic provinces, such as the IPB \n\n(Code\u00e7o, 2015). These indexes are calculated through the equations:  \n\n??????? =\n? ??2?3??? + ??? + ???\n\n? ??2?3 ??? + ??? + ??? + ??? + ?2? + ??2?\n ; \n\n??????? =\n? ?? + ?? + ?? + ??\n\n? ?? + ?? + ?? + ?? + ?? + ??\n \n\nThe computed indices for the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos massive sulphide deposit are \n\nrepresented in Figure IV.15: \n\nThese indices yield more interesting results, which follow petrographic evidence more closely. All \n\nhanging-wall samples, which show no mineralization or hydrothermal activity related to sulphide \n\nprecipitation fall in field III, corresponding to a widespread and regional alteration- oceanic \n\nmetasomatism. Most of the footwall volcanic rocks fall in the upper right corner of the diagram, plot \n\nwith high AImajor and AItrace indexes, within field II, where rocks affected by hydrothermal alteration \n\nrelated to ore-forming hydrothermal systems plot. Despite of the good results some dispersion is \n\nobserved, possibly due to a heterogeneous, multi phase alteration history; that is the case of rocks \n\ndisplaying less pervasive hydrothermal alteration but still preserving some of the mineralogical aspects \n\nrelated to oceanic metasomatic alteration. \n\nFigure IV.15- AItrace vs AImajor plot, for the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit.

ELEMENT MOBILITY \n\nConsidering the range of alteration of the studied rocks, it is essential to assess the mobility of some \n\nelements, especially of trace elements, during the course of the recognized alteration strages. Immobile \n\nelements can be used for mass balance calculations which are important to quantify mass exchanges that \n\noccur within alteration zones. Understanding element mobility is paramount to establish mineral \n\nexploration criteria and for petrological applications, such as determining protoliths and the magma-\n\ntype, besides geodynamic/tectonic setting in which the rocks erupted. \n\nThe recognition of metasomatic and hydrothermal (s.l.) alteration processes in the studied rocks \n\neliminates the possibility of using LILE elements such as K, Rb, Sr, Eu, Cs or Ba, as their considerate \n\nmobility during these processes is well documented (e.g. Rollinson, 1993). It is then more useful to use \n\nHSFE (e.g. REE, Zr, Hf, Ti, Nb, Ta, Pb) since they show relative immobile behaviour during alteration \n\nphenomena (Rollinson, 1993). Some authors select REE, Ti, Zr, Al, Hf, Y, and in some cases, Cr, V and \n\nSc, as the least mobile elements (e.g. McLean &amp; Kranidiotis, 1987; McLean, 1990; Barret &amp; McLean, \n\n1994). Despite of the overall evidence, it has been reported (e.g. McLean &amp; Barret, 1993), that Y and \n\nREE may be fairly mobile under some specific conditions (in comparison to other HSFE), reason why \n\nit is advisable to test their behaviour. The basis for the use of immobile elemens is that their ratios will \n\nremain constant throughout any alteration process the rocks may undergo. \n\nThe TiO2 vs Zr (Figure IV.16 [A]) plot reveals a well-defined trend, especially for the hanging wall \n\nsamples, between two extreme positions, probably recording their primary compositions. Regarding the \n\nplots Zr vs Al2O3 and TiO2 vs Al2O3 (Figure IV 16 [C] and [B], respectively) a wide dispersion is \n\nrecorded, being wider for the hanging-wall samples. The normalization of immobile elements allows to \n\nremove the dispersion effects during multiple alteration processes, allowing to devise trends more \n\nclearly. Hence, the use of Al2O3/TiO2 vs Zr/TiO2 plot should be useful in the distinction of different \n\nigneous protoliths. The interpretation of the Figure IV.16 [D] suggests that the previously observed \n\ndispersion (Figure IV.16 [B]) is due to the mobility of this element (Al) during alteration processes, \n\nrather than due to the existence of different compositional protoliths. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIV.

Thus, V, together with Sc and Fe2O3 chiefly show \n\nmobile behaviour, especially during metasomatic alteration but also during hydrothermal alteration. \n\nSimilarly, Ba and Y are also mobile, but in this case, more so during hydrothermal alteration processes. \n\nIt is also possible to conclude that elements such as Zr, Ti, Hf and Ta show an immobile behaviour, \n\nwhereas elements such as Nb, Y or Yb showing an overall immobile behaviour but, under certain \n\nalteration conditions, they can show be mobile.  \n\n.  \n\nFigure IV.16- [A] TiO2 vs Zr plot; [B] TiO2 vs Al2O3 plot; [C] Zr vs Al2O3 plot; [D] Zr/TiO2 vs Al2O3/TiO2 plot.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIV.3. WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY \n\n \n\n61 \n\nI.V.3.5. MASS BALANCES \n\nMass balance calculations are extremely important to characterize the alteration processes the rocks \n\nunderwent. This is useful in the definition of proxies for mineralized, productive hydrothermal systems \n\nduring exploration surveys. Using the procedure reported in MacLean (1990) procedure, also indicated \n\nin MacLean and Barret (1993) and Barret (2008), the elemental mass balance calculations were made \n\nusing the expression: \n\n?? = ?(?,???????) ?\n? ??,????????? ; \n\n?(?,???????) ?\n=   ? \u00d7 ??,??????? ; \n\n? = [?????????,????????? /?????????,??????? ] \n\nwhere ?(?,???)?\n represents the concentration of a given element (x) in the altered rock, multiplied by an \n\n? factor, which represents the ratio between an immobile element in the precursor and the concentration \n\nof the same immobile element, in the altered sample. For these calculations, ? was calculated using TiO2 \n\nand Zr previously proved to be immobile (see IV.3.4).  \n\nThe precursor composition was obtained by calculating the average values of the elemental \n\nconcentrations for samples MD431-42.1 and MD431-91.0. These samples represent rocks with less \n\nintense metasomatic alteration, amongst the studied hanging-wall volcanic rocks. This chosen precursor \n\ncomposition bears, nonetheless, some alteration which cannot be quantified. Despite the mass gains \n\nrelated with the infilling of vesicles and veins, such alteration probably resulted in a negative mass \n\nbalance, related to the alteration of primary igneous phases and leaching of some mobile elements.   \n\nThe mass balance calculations considered the alteration of the calculated precursor for the different \n\nhydrothermal \u201cfacies\u201d, throughout the whole sampled area based on their intensity, mineralogy and \n\nlocation. Thus, four samples from the open pit were used (group 1): i) two samples showing weak to \n\nmoderate hydrothermal alteration, with pyrite dissemination, mild silicification, Zeo+Qz veins and \n\nzeolites infilled vesicles, with preserved albitized microlites in the rocks matrix (MD-P2-8-1 and MD-\n\nP2-9-1); ii) one sample showing moderate to strong hydrothermal alteration, related to the sulphide \n\nmineralization, with moderate silicification, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite dissemination (MD-P3-\n\n1-1); and iii) one sample showing intense hydrothermal alteration and brecciation, with quartz and \n\nsulphides (Py, Ccp, Sph) replacing the basaltic rock and infilling veins, where chloritized, silicified cores \n\nare preserved (MD-P2-4-1). Additionally, three samples from the SSW area of the deposit were also \n\nused to establish mass balance calculations (group 2): MD431-121.7, MD430.127.7 and MD430-126, \n\ncharacterized by increasing hydrothermal alteration, and showing dissemination of pyrite, chloritization, \n\nweak silicification and scarse Qz+Chl+Py\u00b1Ccp\u00b1Sph veins.  \n\nThe use of Zr and Ti in the calculations of the ? factor provided similar results, with some variations, \n\nespecially in the case of the sample MD-P3-1-1, belonging to the first group. In the other samples, the \n\ncalculations are consistent. It is also important to note that the use of Zr, for the ? factor calculations, \n\nresult in higher values (losses or gains) than when TiO2 is used with the same aim. Thus, the following \n\nreported values refer only to the results obtained while using Zr:  \n\nAlthough the following calculations relate only to the mass exchanges associated to the hydrothermal \n\nalteration, it is possible to infer on the volume changes, associated to the hydrothermal alteration, based \n\non the obtained ? factor. Overall, for the samples that exhibit a less intense hydrothermal alteration, \n\nfrom group 1 and group 2, the ? factor indicates volume loss (?= ~0.5-0.8), possibly related to the \n\nchloritization processes, and to the leaching of mobile elements, while the samples from these two \n\ngroups that exhibit a more intense and pervasive hydrothermal alteration are characterized by volume \n\nincreases (?= 1.3; 1.4; the sample MD-P2-4-1 exhibits a ? of 12), related to the silicification processes \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n62 \n\nand, especially valid for MD-P2-4-1, related to the fracturing and brecciation episodes, with \n\nhydrothermal infills. \n\nConsidering the samples from the SSW part of the deposit (group 2), mass calculations were used to \n\nquantify the hydrothermal alteration elemental exchanges that occurred during hydrothermal alteration \n\n(Figure IV.18 (I) [A]). Overall, these rocks record loss of Na2O, K2O, MnO and SiO2 gains, while the \n\nsample MD431-121.7 shows SiO2 loss, of around 9.8-6.62 wt%. For the least hydrothermally altered \n\nrocks, MgO, CaO, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 are lost, whereas the sample with the strongest hydrothermal \n\nalteration evidences show significant gains for the same elements, around 5-7 wt%. All samples are \n\nenriched in Cu around 100-156 ppm, the one with more intense hydrothermal alteration further showing \n\nZn gains, with a magnitude order in the tens of ppm. Other trace elements show relatively small \n\nnegatives mass balances, such as Sc, Ni, Rb, Cr and Sr. Others, such as Co, show depletions in the least \n\nhydrothermally altered sample of approximately 4-6 ppm but mass gains characterize the other two.  \n\nAs for the open pit samples (Figure IV.18 [B]), the two samples characterized by weak silicification, \n\nshow very similar negative mass balances, characterized by losses in Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, \n\nMnO and Fe2O3, up to 11 wt%. Both samples are found to have considerable gains (tens to hundreds of \n\nppm) in Zn, as well as As and Pb. Sample MD-P2-9-1 shows a small decrease in Cu, whereas MD-P2-\n\n8-1 is characterized by positive Cu mass balance (? 110ppm). These two samples also show depletion \n\nfor Ba. For the rest of the trace elements (e.g. Sr, Ba, Bi) the mass balance is, overall, negative. The \n\nsamples which show a more intense hydrothermal alteration (MD-P3-1-1 and MD-P2-4-1) show \n\nvariable results: regarding the sample MD-P3-1-1, the mass balance results differed when using Zr or \n\nTiO2. Using Zr, the mass balance result in losses in Na2O, CaO, up to 4%, in Cr, Ba, as well as Sr and \n\nRb. Such mass balances are also responsible for gains in MgO ? 10 wt%, Al2O3 ? 19 wt%, SiO2 ? 46 \n\nwt%, Fe2O3 ? 6 wt%. These are accompanied by additions in Cu ? 0.1 wt%, Zn ? 0.05 wt%, V ? 275 \n\nppm and small gains (up to dozens of ppm) in Y, Ge, Nb, Ni and Ag. However, for the same sample, \n\nwhen TiO2 is used in the calculations, the resulting mass balance calculations are different: Na2O \n\ndepletion is of the same magnitude (? 2%), which is also valid for MgO (? 1.8 wt%) and K2O (? 0.6 \n\nwt%), but additional depletions are also evidenced, in Al2O3 ? 2.9 wt%, SiO2 ? 19 wt% and Fe2O3 ? 5 \n\nwt%. Cu and Zn additions are lower than those obtained using Zr (? 317 and 133 ppm, respectively), \n\nwith comparable Cr, Sr and Ba mass losses. Finally, for the most altered sample (MD-P2-4-1), the \n\ncalculated mass balances are characterized by considerable additions in SiO2, Al2O3, MnO, Fe2O3. This \n\nsample is also characterized by significant gains in Cu (11 wt%) and Zn (0.15 wt%), as well as increases \n\nin As (0.3 wt%), V, Co, Pb, Sr and Ba (hundreds to thousand ppm), In, Sn, Tl and Cd (tens of ppm).  \n\nThese mass balances results represent heterogeneous alteration processes: while the majority of the \n\nnegative mass balances can be explained by the breakdown of primary igneous phases and generation \n\nof secondary minerals, such as phyllosilicates, carbonates, epidote and/or titanite, the mass gains \n\nassociated to hydrothermal activity are restricted to samples where the hydrothermal alteration is more \n\nintense. In hydrothermally altered samples, the gains in Fe are generally accompanied by conspicuous \n\nadditions in Mg, representing the formation of secondary phyllosilicates or the influence of diluted \n\nhydrothermal fluids, possibly result of mixtures between ascending hydrothermal fluids and sea-water. \n\nThis Fe and Mg addition is only absent in MD-P2-4-1, which represents an area adjacent to the \n\nmineralization, where gains in Si and Fe, associated to high Cu, Zn, As, Sr and Ba mass increases, are \n\nnot accompanied by Mg, reveal the influence of non-diluted, metal-rich, hydrothermal fluids. The \n\nadditions of calcophile elements such as In, Cd and Sn, for more intense hydrothermal altered samples \n\nmay also reinforce the possibility of a late-stage magmatic input for the hydrothermal fluids. \n\nAdditionally, there are no litogeochemistry data for basaltic samples affected by the hematite \n\nimpregnation, associated to the jaspers and umbers deposition (see Chapter IV.1). Based on the \n\npetrographic evidences, this low-temperature exhalative hydrothermal episode is most likely \n\ncharacterized by positive mass balances, with considerable gains of Fe\u00b1Mn, as well as Mg, Ca, \n\nassociated to the precipitation of chlorite and carbonates, respectively.  \n\n\n\nIV.

COMPOSITIONAL CLASSIFICATION, VOLCANOSTRATIGRAPHY AND TECTONIC SETTING \n\nSeveral classical geochemical diagrams can be used both for classification of volcanic rocks and for \n\ndiscriminating geotectonic eruptive settings. The total alkali-silica (TAS) diagram, distributes volcanic \n\nrocks into 15 different compositional fields, from primitive to more evolved and discriminates alkalik \n\nand sub-akalic series., using the total silica and alkali content (SiO2 vs Na2O + K2O) (LeBas, 1986). The \n\napplication of the TAS diagram is thought to be inefficient for the classification of highly \n\nhydrothermally altered or metamorphosed volcanic rocks as it is based on a set of elements which are \n\nmobile during such processes. Hence, a series of similar diagrams, especially useful for altered volcanic \n\nrocks were developed, using immobile elements as proxies for the classification. The adaptation of Floyd \n\n&amp; Winchester\u2019s diagram (Floyd &amp; Winchester 1977) proposed by Pearce (1996) remains one of the \n\nmost widely used tools, using the the Zr/Ti ratio as a measure of the primitive character of volcanic \n\nrocks (basic vs acid) and Nb/Y to distinguish between tholeiitic vs alkalic affinities. In the TAS diagram \n\n(Figure IV.19) most of the samples fall within the basalt, basaltic andesite or andesite fields, the \n\ndispersion probably resuting from the alteration procsses rather than from magmatic differentiation. \n\nHere, the term \"andesite\" has been applied to rocks of intermediate composition, and not used in its \n\nmore usual petrogenetic meaning of rocks related to active oceanic-continental margins, which is not \n\nthe case of the Sumail ophiolite. For the Zr/Ti vs Nb/Y plot, the samples fall within the basalt and alkali \n\nbasalt fields. The samples falling within the alkali basalt field show more intense hydrothermal \n\nalteration which is consistent with the previously shown minor mobility of some of these elements (Nb, \n\nY) under extreme hydrothermal alteration (see Chapter IV.3.4). Hence, it is possible to infer that the \n\nvolcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit are basic to intermediate, basaltic rocks, with tholeiitic \n\naffinities (Figure IV. 19 [C] and [D]).  \n\nC \n\nD \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n66 \n\nTrace-element and/or immobile element criteria have sometimes been used to distinguish the different \n\nvolcanic units of the Sumail ophiolite.

Some alternative methods to distinguish volcanic units, \n\nnamely those based on clinopyroxene chemistry (e.g. Ishikawa et al., 2002; Kusano et al., 2012; Gilgen \n\net al., 2014) have been proved unreliable by published data. \n\n \n\nFigure IV.20- [A] (La/Yb)C1N vs TiO2 plot; [B] YbN vs TiO2; [C] Nb/Ta vs Zr/Hf plot .

Furthermore, the HSFE ratios (Table IV.3), \n\nthe REE patterns and the Nb and Ta concentrations (section IV.3.2) of the hanging-wall basaltic rocks \n\nare also consistent with those described for the Lasail unit (Godard et al., 2003, 2006; Kusano et al., \n\n2012). Despite some differences in their REE patterns, the average HSFE ratios of the footwall and \n\nhanging-wall volcanic rocks are rather similar. The differences possibly result from the more intense \n\nalteration processes in these rocks, and it will be discussed ahead, especially for the REE patterns (see \n\nChapter V). Thus, considering the HSFE ratios and, especially the REE patterns, both the hanging and \n\nfootwall volcanic rocks are attributed to the Lasail volcanic unit.  \n\nFigure IV.21- C1-normalized REE distributions, [A] for hanging-wall rocks and [B] for footwall rocks; most hydrothermally \n\naltered samples (part of the third group) weren\u2019t compared.

The first plot (Th/Yb vs Nb/Yb) is based on Th and Nb incompatibility and their distinct mobility \n\nduring metassomatism. Since Th is mobile during the dehydration of the subducting slab, but Nb is not, \n\nsuprasubduction lavas are characterized by higher Th values, in comparison to Nb (Pearce et al., 2008). \n\nThe second plot (V vs Ti), from Shervais (1982) is based on the difference in the Ti and V contents and \n\nrelies on their incompatibility: in water-induced partial melting, magmas are richer in V and have lower \n\nTi contents. In Figure IV.22 [A], both the hanging and footwall rocks that host the Mandoos deposit are \n\nfound to have higher Th/Yb values compared to MORB, possibly indicating a modification of the mantle \n\nsource, by subduction-derived fluids. These values are higher for the hanging wall volcanic rocks and \n\npresent a wider dispersion for the footwall rocks, possibly due to the hydrothermal alteration, during the \n\nmineralizing episode(s). This data is also supported by the N-MORB-normalized incompatible elements \n\n(Figure IV.23), as these patterns are typically interpreted as characteristic of suprasubduction zones (e.g. \n\nSaccani et al., 2011). Additionally, most of the studied samples fall within the MORB-like and IAT \n\ncompositional fields, in the V/(Ti/1000) diagram. Despite the general agreement that these plots are \n\nuseful to fingerprint the tectonic setting of ophiolitic rocks, their interpretation should be cautious, as \n\nthere are other geochemical and petrological mechanisms that might explain the geochemical features \n\nof these rocks, as discussed ahead (see Chapter V).\n\nFigure IV.23- N-MORB-normalized multi-elemental diagrams of the hanging and footwall volcanic rocks. \n\nFigure IV.22- Discriminant diagram used to fingerprint the tectonic settings of ophiolites: [A] Th/Yb vs Nb/Yb, from Pearce \n\net al.

DISCUSSION \n\nThe volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos VMS deposit occur as microporphyritic massive flows and/or \n\npillow lavas, locally brecciated. Their primary mineralogy is composed of augite and bytownite euhedral \n\nmicrophenocrysts, set in a microlitic matrix composed of bytownite microlites, with similar Ca-rich \n\ncompositions, with small and sparse, skeletical Ti-rich magnetite grains. All the hanging-wall samples \n\nand some footwall rocks show pervasive alteration marked by the breakdown and substitution of the \n\nmicrophenocrysts: the clinopyroxene is altered into a calcic amphibole (actinolite?) and then to a \n\nchlorite\u00b1epidote assemblage, while plagioclase are partly to completely replaced by albite. The same \n\n(partial to complete) substitution is also observed in the plagioclase microlites. The groundmass is \n\ncomposed of phyllosilicates (Chl-Sme), that also occur as vesicle infills, as radial aggregates, possibly \n\nrepresenting the alteration of a volcanic glassy groundmass. The small skeletical iron oxides often show \n\ncorroded rims and small titanite crystals in its surroundings. These basaltic rocks are ocasionally, \n\nbrecciated in situ, the fractures acting as channels, increasing the permeability and allowing the \n\ncirculation of sea water derived fluids, causing the alteration to proceed and the precipitation of \n\nmicrocrystalline quartz and chlorite, with minor carbonates, producing a \u201cbreccia-like\u201d texture, with \n\naltered basaltic pseudo-clasts, surrounded by a fine-grained matrix. This fragmentation reflects the \n\ngeneration of physical discontinuities, wich enabled fluid circulation, during which late precipitation of \n\nquartz and chlorite. The alteration processes resulted in a breccia-like texture, with no jigsaw-fit \n\ngeometry and/or block rotation, but instead characterized by isolated basaltic pseudo-clasts within the \n\nfine-grained pseudo-matrix. Thus, these samples might represent the top of massive flows/pillow-lavas, \n\nwhere the interaction with seawater caused quenching and in-situ fracturing, and the consequent \n\nincreasing permeability favoured fluid circulation. \n\nThis pervasive metasomatic alteration is found in all hanging-wall samples and in the footwall samples \n\nwhich show a less intense hydrothermal ore-forming alteration, thus suggesting a widespread regional-\n\nscale metasomatic event. Taking the secondary mineral phases into account, it is likely that this stage \n\ncorresponds to low temperature oceanic metassomatism, caused by sea water, and derived fluids; during \n\nthis stage, the primary minerals of these volcanic rocks may have acted as a buffer for the chemical \n\nreactions, controlling the chemical composition of the secondary mineral phases, and thus \n\nmetasomatism progressed under low water/rock ratios. Later calcite, calcite + calcic zeolites, formed \n\nveins and vesicles infills, possibly marking an increase in the temperature of the system.  \n\nLow-temperature exhalative hydrothermal episodes are also identified, and in some cases, preceeded \n\nthe ore-forming hydrothermal episode. This stage is marked by hematite + carbonates + chlorite veins, \n\nby local hematite impregnations and by the formation of jaspers and umbers. While the jaspers/umbers \n\nare mostly found in specific areas (E, SE area, and locally in the open pit), the hematite-bearing veins \n\nare found throughout the volcanic sequence. It is likely that the formation of these silica and hematite \n\n(and Mn)-rich exhalative rocks is structurally-controlled, involving the circulation of Fe(\u00b1Mn)-rich and \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n70 \n\nsulphur-poor, siliceous and oxidizing hydrothermal fluids. These are later crosscut by calcite veins, in \n\nthe hanging wall sequence, and by Qz+Py and Cal+Py veins in the footwall rocks. In some cases, \n\nhematite-silica veins are found cutting the hydrothermally altered rocks. This indicates that temperature \n\ndecrease, during the final waning-stage of the hydrothermal system, triggered the development of \n\nanother exhalative low-T hydrothermal episode. \n\nThe hydrothermal stage related to the mineralization event, is recorded by a set of quartz veins, with \n\npyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor sphalerite and apatite disseminations; in certain areas of the deposit \n\n(central part, near the open pit), the hydrothermal alteration is marked by silicification, accompanied by \n\npyrite dissemination and, in other cases (drill-core samples), by more intense chloritization pyrite \n\ndissemination with quartz, pyrite \u00b1 chalcopyrite veins. This difference is possibly a consequence of i) \n\nabundant vesicles promoting the circulation of hydrothermal fluids and leading to more pervasive and \n\nintense of alteration (e.g. open pit area) and; ii) secondary permeability due to the \u00abnetwork of fractures \n\nand veins which form the stockwork and enabled more focussed fluid-flow. Additionally, the existence \n\nof footwall samples that do not show evidences of hydrothermal alteration also supports the structural \n\ncontrol on the development of this hydrothermal system, representing samples which were not cut by \n\nthe structures that channeled the hydrothermal fluids and, consequently, were not pervasively altered by \n\ntheir circulation. The development of such fracture(s) and vein(s) network is related to hydraulic \n\nfracturing, associated to the circulation of the mineralizing fluids. \n\nZeolites are also found in the footwall volcanic rocks. In some cases, they occur within veins, which are \n\nlater crosscut by microcrystalline quartz veins; they fill the vesicles in weak to moderately \n\nhydrothermally altered rock (from the open pit), and they are also found filling open spaces in the \n\nmassive sulphide which show typical primary textures found in black-smokers-type vents. This indicates \n\nthat during the hydrothermal circulation, zeolites precipitated directly from a more alkaline \n\nhydrothermal fluid, possibly during the late stages of the hydrothermal fluid circulation, denoting a \n\npossible mixture or increase in the sea-water derived component of the hydrothermal fluid, coeval to the \n\nreopening of some hydrothermal veins and calcitic Cb + Py precipitation, as previously described (see \n\nChapter IV.1, Figure IV.3). Despite the difficulties in adjusting the analysed minerals to any calcic \n\nzeolite stoichiometry, some analysis made in the samples collected at the open pit resemble laumontite \n\nand (Ca-) epistilbite. These zeolites have been described in present day and fossil mineralised \n\nhydrothermal/geothermal systems, e.g. Iceland and Troodos ophiolite (Marosv\u00f6lgyi et al., 2010; Dill et \n\nal., 2007), where the temperature record was below 200-250\u00baC.  \n\nThe presence of the aluminium-rich phyllosilicates (kaolinite, halloysite, donbassite?) in the open-pit \n\nsamples, combined in association with more intense hydrothermal alteration (silicification and \n\npyritization) reinforces the idea that these rocks experienced a more intense and pervasive leaching and \n\nhydrothermal alteration process under strong acid conditions.  \n\nLess vesicular volcanic rocks, further from the open pit (and possibly from structural discontinuities), \n\nexhibit less pervasive alteration, with occasional quartz, chlorite and pyrite \u00b1 chalcopyrite veins, in a \n\nmildly silicified matrix, with more intense chloritization and pyrite dissemination. Despite this, most of \n\nthe samples from the footwall volcanic sequence were retrieved relatively far from the area where the \n\nhydrothermal activity was more intense and focalized, while some of the samples that show a more \n\nintense hydrothermal alteration came from the open pit, where the sulphide lens was thickest (thus, \n\nsampling the basaltic rocks that were most affected by the hydrothermal processes related to the \n\nmineralization).  \n\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n71 \n\nThe intermittence of volcanic eruptions and the residual heat from sub-volcanic intrusions have \n\nsustained hydrothermal activity, which consisted of: i) exhalative, low-temperature hydrothermal \n\nepisodes, characterized by hematite veins and deposition of jaspers and umbers; and ii) a ore-forming \n\nhydrothermal system, with development of a network of crack-and-seal veins and veinlets, where \n\nsulphides (pyrite, chalcopyrite and minor sphalerite) precipitated, together with quartz, chlorite and \n\naccessory apatite, in a stockwork-like arrangement with an intensely silicified zone; Py, Cpy and Sph, \n\ndisseminations formed close to the massive sulphide mineralization, and late Zeol and Cal+Py veins \n\nsometimes re-open previous structures. In extreme cases (such as the sample MD-P2-4-1), the \n\nhydrothermal ore-forming processes resulted in pervasive pyrite (with minor chalcopyrite and \n\nsphalerite) and quartz replacements, with intense brecciation and hydrothermal (Qz+Py\u00b1Ccp) \n\nprecipitates, leaving only chlorite+quartz rich cores, remnants of the intensely replaced basaltic rocks. \n\nThis suggests that the mineralizing system developed, as well, in sub-superficial conditions, as sub-sea \n\nfloor replacements. This process can also be promoted by the presence of pre-existent discontinuities, \n\nsuch as the ones described for the in situ fragmentation, in the hanging-wall sequence.  \n\nThe spatial distribution of these hydrothermal alteration facies is structurally controlled, but variations \n\nin the amount and distribution of vesicles, determined the volcanic rocks primary permeability, also \n\ninfluencing the circulation of the hydrothermal fluids. In order to fully characterise the distribution of \n\nthe hydrothermal alteration haloes a more comprehensive sampling would be necessary  \n\nEvidences of widespread low-temperature alteration (oceanic metassomatism) followed by temperature \n\nincrease (hematite veins and jaspers formation) in the hanging and footwall rocks supports a multi stage \n\ncyclical evolution of the system, having common heat-sources (such as sub-volcanic intrusions) wich \n\nfavoured the recurrence of similar processes in different time-periods, before and after the mineralization \n\nprocesses took place.  \n\nThe hydrothermal fluids involved in the mineralization are nonoxidizing, siliceous fluids, probably sea-\n\nwater derived, which scavenged metals from the underlying volcanic and hypabyssal rocks. During fluid \n\ncirculation, the fluid-chemistry controlled the progression of the mineralogical transformations at high \n\nwater/rock ratios, also supported by the intense quartz and chlorite alteration in the open pit samples \n\n(Hannington, 2014). According to the chlorite-based geothermometers of Jowett (1991) and Bourdelle \n\net al., (2009), mineralizing fluids would have circulated at temperatures between ~200-430\u00baC (median \n\nT ~275\u00baC). This temperature range is provided for the overall hydrothermal mineralising stage, since it \n\nwas not possible to differentiate to which of the episodes the analysed chlorites belonged to. These \n\ntemperatures were obtained using samples from the more distal SSE part of the deposit. Thus, it is \n\nadmissible that these temperatures are lower than those expected for chlorites from the stockwork \n\ndirectly below the open-pit area, where the hydrothermal system was more vigorous. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of small crystals of fluorapatite related to the hydrothermal alteration and \n\nmineralization, possibly indicates: I) the leaching of P from overlying pelagic organic matter-rich \n\nsediments; or II) an input of late-stage magmatic fluids/volatiles for the hydrothermal fluids (P and F), \n\nrelated to the crystallization of the doleritic rocks, since Ap is also found in these rocks; such crystals \n\nresult precipitate directly from exsolved late-magmatic, volatile-rich (e.g. F) fluids, also responsible for \n\nthe presence of small, disseminated, sulphides.  \n\nThe rocks that host the Mandoos deposit record several mineralogical transformations and major and \n\ntrace-element compositional modifications, caused by the different interpreted alteration events. During \n\nsuch alteration events, elements like Zr, Ti, Hf, show an immobile behaviour, while elements such as \n\nAl, Nb, Ta, Y or Yb are found to be slightly mobile, under specific conditions. These alteration \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n72 \n\nevidences, during the different distinguished stages, are expressed in the mineralogical transformations \n\nobserved and can be quantified through mass balance calculations. \n\nThe application of the alteration box-plot proposed by Large et al. (2001) based on whole rock \n\ngeochemical data, corroborates the mineralogical transformations and the precipitation of secondary \n\nmineral phases, observed in the studied rocks especially those affected by the mineralising hydrothermal \n\nalteration event. The hanging-wall rocks follow a regional/diagenetic alteration trends wherein the \n\nformation of a secondary k-feldspars+albite mineral association is predicted. However, K-feldspar is \n\nnot observed in the studied samples and instead, secondary K-bearing phyllosilicates are formed. \n\nFinally, the use of AImajor and AItrace, proposed by H\u00e4ussinger (1993), allowed a clear the distinction \n\nbetween hydrothermally altered samples, associated to mineralizing hydrothermal activity and regional \n\nmetasomatic alteration.  \n\nMass balance calculations were not possible for the initial metasomatic alteration event due to lack of \n\nsamples without this alteration imprint. Nevertheless, through the analysis of the major and trace element \n\ndata, it is possible to infer that oceanic metasomatism led mainly to negative mass balances, \n\ncharacterized by a high mobility of elements like K, Na, Ca, Rb, Sr, U, in spite of the mass gains, result \n\nof the veins sealing and vesicles infills by secondary mineral phases. This sea-water induced regional \n\nalteration is, possibly, also responsible for the observable negative Ce anomalies in the hanging and \n\nfootwall lavas, as these fluids are typically characterized by such anomalies. For the low-temperature, \n\nexhalative hydrothermal alteration, mass balances were also not calculated, due to the inexistence of \n\nlitogeochemical data for volcanic rocks that are only affected by this alteration processes. Nevertheless, \n\nconsidering the petrographic analysis and interpretation and the other products of these exhalative \n\nprocesses (formation of jaspers and umbers), it is possible to infer positive mass balances, with net gains \n\nin Fe \u00b1 Mn, Ca, Mg and possibly in P and other elements, such as As or Pb.  \n\nThe mass balances, calculated for the hydrothermal alteration, conspicuous of the ore-forming stage, are \n\ncharacterized by overall negative balances, with some exceptions regarding the samples recording more \n\nintense hydrothermal alteration. The breakdown of primary mineral phases and the formation of \n\nsecondary mineral phases resulted in depletion in Si and other elements such as Ca or Mg, generally \n\naccompanied by losses in Si. These hydrothermal alteration haloes are further characterized by Fe \n\nadditions, followed by mass gains in Mg and significant Zn and Cu; these may account for more diluted \n\nhydrothermal fluids, possibly related to sea water infiltration and mixture. Nevertheless, in the open pit \n\nsamples, where the mineralization is more developed, the results show additions in Si and Fe, as well as \n\nCu, Zn, As, Ba and lower or negative mass balances of Mg, revealing the input of non-diluted, \n\nhydrothermal, metal-rich fluids. The In and Sn, Tl and Cd gains, in the most intensily mineralized \n\nsamples, can also support the possibility of a late-stage magmatic fluid input in the hydrothermal fluids, \n\nsince these elements are usually associated with (late-stage) exsolved magmatic fluids. \n\nThese mineralogical transformation and textural features, as well as the lithogeochemical data, are \n\ncompatible with previously described hydrothermal alteration haloes, in mafic-hosted VMS deposits. \n\nThe intense silicification and the dissemination of pyrite, in the vicinity of the massive sulphide body \n\n(open pit samples), is well documented within the literature (e.g. Galley and Koski, 1999; Franklin et \n\nal., 2005; Galley et al., 2007; Hannington, 2014; \u201cQuartz-Pyrite stockwork), where Si precipitates \n\ndirectly from the hydrothermal fluids, possibly from the rapid cooling of the hydrothermal fluids. The \n\nchloritization and pyrite dissemination, found in the SE drill-core samples, is also commonly described \n\nwithin the literature (e.g. Galley and Koski, 1999; Franklin et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007), \n\ncorresponding, usually, to the lower-temperature, stockwork-related alteration. \n\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n73 \n\nFinally, petrogenetic and volcanostratigraphic significance the volcanic rocks are discussed. The \n\ncomparison of their geochemical features (REE bulk contents, their LREE depleted and HREE flat-\n\nsegment, incompatible element ratios, and incompatible elements trace contents), with published data \n\nfor the ophiolite volcanic units strongly suggests that the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit \n\nare part of the Lasail volcanic unit. The more enriched REE patterns of the footwall volcanic rocks \n\n(Figure IV.15) can be explained by apparent gains during alteration processes and the neoformation of \n\nsecondary mineral phases that retain these elements in their mineral structure. Nevertheless, such \n\ndifferences can also be interpreted as resulting from magmatic differentiation; in this situation, these \n\nfeatures could indicate a transition from the more evolved, REE enriched Geotimes volcanism to more \n\nprimitive, REE depleted Lasail rocks, as previously documented in the literature (Godard et al., 2006). \n\nIn this case, these footwall lavas can still be attributed to the Lasail unit, mostly based on their HSFE \n\nratio, but would represent a transitional volcanism, between the two volcanic units. \n\nThe REE ratios (LaN/SmN, LaN/YbN), N-MORB-normalized patterns (Figure IV. 20), especially their Ti \n\ncontents and their Nb depletion and high Th contents of the volcanic rocks hosting the Mandoos deposit \n\nare compatible with the Medium Titanium Basalts (MTB), as defined by Saccani et al., (2011), and also \n\nwith other interpretations for similar volcanic rocks (Saccani et al., 2011 and references therein). These \n\nauthors suggest that MTB rocks originated from partial melting of a more refractory mantle source than \n\nthat associated with typical MORB; such source could be a SSZ mantle wedge which underwent 8-10% \n\nof partial melting after a first MORB-melt extraction. They also interpreted the LREE depletion of the \n\nMTB\u2019s as an evidence that the subduction related fluid-induced partial-melting was not responsible for \n\nsignificant enrichments of the SSZ mantle wedge. The V2 volcanic sequence of the Sumail ophiolite \n\n(Alley. followed by boninites has been interpreted as being generated in a SSZ setting, associated to the \n\ninterpreted intra oceanic thrusting, followed by dehydration and consequent metasomatic modification \n\nof the mantle source (e.g. Searl, 2007). The lower Geotimes unit, thought to have erupted in a MOR-\n\nsetting, was targeted in recent studies (MacLeod et al., 2013), where it was concluded that the water \n\ncontent involved in its fractionation is not consistent with an eruption in a MOR setting, instead, the \n\ngeotectonic setting was interpreted as a back-arc basin. Indeed, the geochemical compositions of the \n\nGeotimes and Lasail rocks are consistent with those found on back-arc basins, distant from subduction \n\nzones (e.g. Lau-basin or North Fiji Basin; Godard et al., 2006 and references therein; see Figure IV.15). \n\nWhile the Alley unit is considered to have a clear arc/SSZ signature, some authors suggest that Lasail \n\nvolcanic rocks also bear the same geochemical signature (e.g. Searl, 2007). \n\nGodard et al. (2006) interpreted the LREE depletion, the lower incompatible element abundances \n\n(except for mobile elements such as Rb, Sr), such as Ta, Nb, Ti, and the Nd, Pb and Sr isotopic \n\ncomposition for the Lasail unit as the result of a later partial melting from the same mantle source as \n\nGeotimes (DMM), the Sumail peridotites, which underwent high degrees of melt extraction (15-30%). \n\nThis later partial melting, that originated the depleted Lasail volcanics, would have involved the mixture \n\nbetween high-degree fractional melting (25%) of DMM and a small fraction of melt (2%) in equilibrium \n\nwith the peridotitic rocks, resulting in geochemical compositions altogether similar to the ones described \n\nfor the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit (Godard et al., 2006). Furthermore, the isotopic \n\ncompositions of Lasail and Geotimes rocks are similar to those in Geotimes unit: their ?Nd and Pb \n\nisotopic signatures do not resemble any present-day slab-derived contamination setting, eliminating the \n\npossibility of these rocks originating in an arc-like setting. Additionally, the mobile elements spectrum, \n\nespecially the enrichments in Rb, Sr, U and Pb, were explained by pervasive alteration, associated to \n\nsea-water and sea-water derived fluids, under low-temperature conditions, similar to the oceanic \n\nmetasomatic event described in this work (see Chapter IV.3.2.1).  \n\n\n\nMINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN \n\n74 \n\nConsidering the available published data for the Lasail volcanic unit, especially regarding its isotopic \n\ncompositions, these low-Ti, LREE depleted basalts possibly erupted in a back-arc basin. These are the \n\nresult of a later, shallower, high % melting event of a DMM-like source, following an initial lower-\n\ndegree partial melting (extraction of Geotimes). This volcanic unit (Lasail) is usually considered as part \n\nof V2 magmatic stage of the Sumail, for which there is widespread agreement on the arc-affinity/SSZ \n\nsignature (Figure IV. 22). Additionally, the tholeiitic nature of these rocks excludes any genetic \n\nrelationship with typical alkaline-affinity off-axis volcanism. Considering the previous discussion, one \n\nmay suggest that this unit should be attributed to the upper part of the V1 volcanic episode, as it does \n\nnot seem to result from partial melting of a SSZ-modified mantle source; instead, it is likely that it \n\nformed during the latest stages of V1 volcanism, through partial melting of a depleted mantle source, \n\nafter extraction of the Geotimes basalts, in a ridge-like setting. \n\nIV.2. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe volcanic sequence that host the Mandoos deposit includes basaltic to basalt-andesitic rocks with \n\ntholeiitic affinities, and with HSFE ratios and REE patterns characteristic of the Lasail volcanic unit. \n\nThose rocks represent the product of late partial melting of a depleted DMM source, during the first \n\nvolcanic episode (V1), in a ridge-like setting (Godard et al., 2006). \n\nThese rocks include pillow-lavas and massive volcanic flows whose texture and mineralogy documents \n\nthe progression of heterogeneously developed and multi-staged alteration processes triggered by fluid-\n\nrock interactions. These processes were locally promoted by physical discontinuities, generated during \n\nin-situ brecciation processes. Nevertheless, structurally-controlled fractures, related to hydraulic \n\nfracturing play an important role in fluid circulation, thus controlling the development of the alteration \n\npatterns.  \n\nThe breakdown of primary igneous phases, i.e. clinopyroxene microphenocrysts and magnetite, into \n\nAct+Chl+Ep and Ttn, albitization of the plagioclase microphenocrysts and microlites, and the \n\nneoformation of secondary mineral phases, such as carbonates, phyllosilicates (Chl-Sme \n\ninterstratificates) and zeolites, in veins and vesicles, is of pervasive nature. This alteration marks the \n\noceanic metassomatic alteration, also found in the footwall volcanic rocks, also known as spilitization. \n\nThis process developed in (sub-)superficial conditions, involving sea-water fluids, at low water/rock \n\nratios. \n\nThe spatial distribution of the alteration haloes associated with hydrothermal stages is structurally \n\ncontrolled but also related to primary permeability, determined by the amount (and connectivity) of the \n\nvesicles: i) the distribution and circulation of low-temperature hydrothermal, siliceous, S-poor and Fe-\n\nrich fluids, was responsible for the deposition of jaspers, with hematite impregnations in the underlying \n\nbasaltic rocks; ii) the main hydrothermal activity is contemporaneous with the sulphide deposition. In \n\nthe open pit samples, silicification processes are recorded, accompanied by the dissemination of pyrite \n\nwith occasional chalcopyrite and sphalerite, sometimes preserving remnants of the feldspars microlites, \n\nin the rocks matrix. Locally, some Zeo+Qz veins cut these hydrothermally altered rocks, possibly \n\ndeveloped during the reopening and sealing of a set of Cb+Py veins. These zeolite-bearing veins are \n\nlater re-opened and sealed by microcrystalline Qz, suggesting a rapid cooling and also the important \n\nstructural control on the hydrothermal fluids circulation. Towards the SSE part of the deposit, the \n\nhydrothermal alteration is marked by chloritization and pyrite dissemination, accompanied by mild \n\nsilicification, with occasional Qz+Chl+Py+Ccp veins. Here, a strong variation in the alteration is \n\nobserved: the presence of chloritized volcanic rocks contrasts with mildly silicified, chloritized (and also \n\npyritized) volcanic rocks which essentially exhibits the alteration mineralogical association attributed to \n\n\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n75 \n\nthe oceanic metassomatic alteration. Regardless of the differences on the hydrothermal alteration \n\n\u201cfacies\u201d, further sampling (e.g. in the stockwork that underlies the massive sulphide lens and from \n\ndifferent areas of the open pit, as well as a more detailed mapping of this area) would allow a better \n\nunderstanding of the spatial development and distribution of these haloes. Nevertheless, the \n\nrecognizable mineralogical and textural alterations are analogous to those described in the literature for \n\nthe mafic-hosted VMS-type deposits: a highly silicified and pyritized area, beneath the massive sulphide \n\nlens (quartz and pyrite stockwork) and the lower-temperature alteration, related to the stockwork that \n\nfed the hydrothermal system, characterized by chlorite and pyrite (chlorite-pyrite stockwork).  \n\nThe hydrothermal fluids responsible for the massive sulphide mineralization are characterized by \n\nmoderate to high temperatures (195-430\u00baC), most cerntainly acidic and bearing relatively high metal \n\ncontents; its chemistry as mostly controlled the chemical reactions that developed the alteration haloes, \n\nunder high water/rock ratios.  \n\nThe residual heat derived from the cooling of sub-volcanic intrusions \u2013 dolerite dykes \u2013 sustained such \n\nhydrothermal processes; the presence of small disseminated Ap crystals, as well as sulphides (Py), in \n\nthe doleritic rocks suggest a small contribution of late-stage magmatic volatiles to the hydrothermal \n\nfluid, responsible for the precipitation of accessory apatite in the hydrothermally altered footwall \n\nvolcanic rocks. This input is probably also responsible for increases in the In, Cd, Tl and Sn contents in \n\nthe most mineralized samples. \n\nApart from the pervasive oceanic metasomatism, the similarities between the hanging-wall and footwall \n\nrocks imply that similar heat-sources favoured the development of low-temperature hydrothermal \n\nprocesses at different times, explaining the occurrence of jaspers and/or umbers both before and after \n\nthe main mineralization event, during the waning of the hydrothermal system.  \n\nThe mineralogical and textural transformations are also evident in the major element geochemistry \n\nvariations, using the AI and CCPI indexes. These indexes represent lithogeochemical compositional \n\nmodifications which result in secondary mineral associations characterized by I) Ab+Chl; II) \n\nAb+Chl+Ep; III) Chl+Py; IV) Cb\u00b1Ser; V) Chl+Cb. Such compositional modifications are consistent \n\nwith mass losses, although some major and trace element additions are recorded; these are usually \n\nassociated with hydrothermal activity, marked by vein- and vesicle-infilling or, during extreme \n\nhydrothermal alteration, by sulphide deposition. Furthermore, the AImajor and AItrace indices (H\u00e4ussinger, \n\n1993) successfully discriminate various alteration trends, related or not to ore-forming hydrothermal \n\nsystems, and rather useful for VMS exploration. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER VI  \nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nALABASTER, T., PEARCE, J.A., MALLICK, D.I.J., AND ELBOUSHI, I.M., 1980, The volcanic stratigraphy and location \n\nof massive sulphide deposits in the Oman ophiolite.
