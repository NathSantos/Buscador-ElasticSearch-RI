Before using a model, however, \nthe model must demonstrate that it can correctly simulate the hydrological and \nerosive processes of a given site.  the swat model (soil and water assessment \ntool) was developed in the United states to evaluate the effects of conservation \nagriculture on hydrological processes and water quality at the watershed scale.  \nthis model was initially proposed for use without calibration, which would \neliminate the need for measured hydro-sedimentologic data.  in this study, the \nswat model was evaluated in a small rural watershed (1.19 km\u00b2) located on the \nbasalt slopes of the state of rio grande do sul in southern Brazil, where farmers \nhave been using cover crops associated with minimum tillage to control soil \nerosion.  Values simulated by the model were compared with measured hydro-\nsedimentological data.  results for surface and total runoff on a daily basis were \nconsidered unsatisfactory (nash-sutcliffe efficiency coefficient \u2013 nse &lt;0.5).  \nhowever simulation results on monthly and annual scales were significantly \nbetter.  with regard to the erosion process, the simulated sediment yields for all \nyears of the study were unsatisfactory in comparison with the observed values \non a daily and monthly basis (nse values &lt;-6), and overestimated the annual \nsediment yield by more than 100 %.\n\nindex terms: soil and management, water erosion, sediment yield, hydrologic \nmodeling.\n\n(1) received for publication in May 3, 2011 and approved in december 1, 2011.\n(2) civil engineer, Master in water resources and environmental sanitation by the institute of hydraulic research at the federal \n\nUniversity of rio grande do sul \u2013 Ufrgs. av.

A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo, no entanto, deve ser antecedida \nde uma etapa inicial, a fim de verificar o desempenho dele em simular corretamente os \nprocessos hidrol\u00f3gicos e erosivos de um dado local.  O modelo SWAT (Soil and Water \nAcesamente Tool) foi desenvolvido nos Estados Unidos para avaliar os efeitos da agricultura \nconservacionista sobre os processos hidrol\u00f3gicos e de qualidade de \u00e1gua na escala de bacia.  \nEsse modelo foi inicialmente proposto para ser utilizado sem a necessidade de calibra\u00e7\u00e3o, \no que dispensaria o uso de dados hidrossedimentol\u00f3gicos medidos.  Nessa condi\u00e7\u00e3o, o \nmodelo SWAT foi avaliado em uma pequena bacia rural (1,19 km\u00b2) localizada nas encostas \nbas\u00e1lticas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, onde culturas de cobertura associadas com o \ncultivo m\u00ednimo v\u00eam sendo empregadas pelos agricultores para controlar o processo erosivo.  \nValores simulados pelo modelo SWAT foram comparados com dados hidrossedimentol\u00f3gicos \nmedidos.  Como resultado da simula\u00e7\u00e3o, verificou-se que o escoamento superficial e o total, \npara a escala de tempo di\u00e1ria, foram considerados insatisfat\u00f3rios (valores de COE &lt;0,5).  \nJ\u00e1 as mesmas simula\u00e7\u00f5es para as escalas mensal e anual apresentaram resultados \nsensivelmente melhores.  Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao processo erosivo, verificou-se para todos os anos \nque a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos simulada, quando comparada com os valores observados, foi \ninsatisfat\u00f3ria para as simula\u00e7\u00f5es di\u00e1rias e mensais (valores de COE &lt;-6) e superestimou \nem mais de 100 % a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos anual.\n\nTermos de indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: manejo do solo, eros\u00e3o h\u00eddrica, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos, modelo \nhydrol\u00f3gico.\n\nintrodUction\n\nMathematical models have been used to assist \nin planning improvements in soil and water \nconservation practices (arnold et al., 1999; Jha \net al., 2006; Borah et al., 2006).  to perform these \nfunctions, however, the models must be able to \nsimulate hydrologic processes as well as track the \ntransference of sediments and pollutants to the \ndrainage network.\n\namong the several mathematical models \ncurrently in use, the swat model stands apart \n(arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp; fohrer, 2005).  this \nmodel has been widely used with good results, both \nin the U.s. and elsewhere in the world, to evaluate \nthe effects of land use and soil management on \nhydrology, sediment yield (ceaP, 2010) and water \nquality (Borah et al., 2006; Benham et al., 2006).  in \nBrazil, the swat model has great potential to be \nused as a support tool for planning an appropriate \nland use to improve water quality.  Potential \napplications would be by watershed committees, \nfor water resource management, water supply \ncompanies (Minoti, 2006) and for hydroelectric \npower generation projects (andriolo et al., 2008).\n\nthe swat model (arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp; \nfohrer, 2005) was initially developed to be applied \n\nto ungauged basins (gassman et al., 2007).  this \nmeans that the swat model could be applied \nwithout calibration since this step implies the need \nfor good quality hydro-sedimentological monitoring \ndata (consistent time series).  this information is \nquite rare in the world, except in the U.s. and some \neuropean countries.\n\nthe United states department of agriculture \n(Usda) together with american universities \ndeveloped the swat model based on a comprehensive \ndatabase (Burford &amp; clark, 1973) from gauged \nbasins in that country.  therefore, for american \nconditions, the simulation could be performed \nwithout the need for calibration.  while the \npossibility of using a model without calibration \nmay be appealing, it is unlikely that a model would \nbe able to perform adequate hydro-sedimentolgical \nsimulations in regions other than those for which \nthe model was developed.  the best way to assess \nthe performance of a mathematical model at a given \nlocation is by comparing simulated results with \nactual monitoring data.\n\nin Brazil, the swat model has been used to \nassess the effects of different land use and soil \nmanagement scenarios on hydrology and sediment \nyield (oliveira et al., 1999; Machado &amp; Vettorazzi, \n2003; Baldissera, 2005; Moro et al., 2005; Prado \n\n\n\nUse of the swat Model for hydro-sediMentologic siMUlation in a sMall...          559\n\nr. Bras. ci. solo, 36:557-565, 2012\n\net al., 2006; Minoti, 2006; adriolo et al., 2008).  \nhowever, studies where the simulated data are \ncompared to the observed data, based on situations \nwhere the model was applied with and without \ncalibration, are rarely found.  this study aimed to \nevaluate the efficiency and limitations of the swat \nmodel without calibration to simulate different \ntime scales (daily, monthly and annual), runoff and \nsediment yield.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nstudy area description\n\nthe 1.19 km\u00b2 rural watershed used for this study \nis located in southern Brazil, in the municipality \nof arvorezinha, in the northeastern region of the \nstate of rio grande do sul (28\u00b0 52\u2019 10\u201d s and 52\u00b0 \n10\u2019 30\u201d w).  water and sediment discharge drain \nthrough the lajeado ferreira brook which is a \ntributary of the guapor\u00e9 river (taquari-antas \nbasin).  according to the K\u00f6ppen classification, the \narvorezinha watershed is inserted in a cfb climate \nregion \u2013 temperate, super humid, mesothermal \nclimate with cool summers and frequent severe \nfrosts.  the average daily temperature of the \nwarmest month is below 22 \u00b0c, and of the coolest \nmonth is over 3 \u00b0c.  annual rainfall varies from 1250 \nto 2000 mm, and is well distributed throughout the \nyear, without a defined dry or rainy season (nimer, \n1990).\n\ntopography ranges from flat to mountainous.  \nBasalt is the common parent soil material, from \nwhich soils such as Ultisols, entisols and cambisols \nwere formed according to the relief (embrapa, \n2006).  the native vegetation consists of subtropical \nBrazilian atlantic rainforest.\n\nhydro-sedimentological monitoring\n\nfive rain gauges were installed in the arvorezinha \nwatershed.  to monitor water flow at the outlet, \na Parshall flume was built with a level sensor/ \nlevellogger to continuously record the water \nlevel.  the suspended sediment load discharge \nis determined by the product of the flow rate (Q) \nand the suspended sediment concentration (ssc), \nthe latter obtained manually using an isokinetic \nsediment hand sampler U.s. dh-48 (edwards &amp; \nglysson, 1998), which determines the ssc by the \nevaporation method (guy, 1969).  sediment yield \n(sy) is calculated by relating the sediment load \ndischarge with the duration of each event (Minella \net al., 2008).  details of monitoring, separation of \nsurface runoff from total flow discharge (baseflow \n+ runoff) obtained by an observed hydrograph, \nclimatic data and observed sediment load discharge \n\nwere described by Uzeika (2009).  the observed \ndata used to compare the values simulated by the \nswat model correspond to the monitoring series \nfrom 2002 to 2006.\n\ninput soil parameters used in the model were \nmeasured in the entire watershed, considering \nthe different land uses and soil managements \n(dalbianco, 2009).\n\nUsing the swat Model\n\nthe swat model (arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp; \nfohrer, 2005) is a hydro-sedimentologic model at the \nwatershed scale, usually applied in continuous-time \nsimulations that can be discretized in monthly, daily \nand sub-daily scales.  thus, the input data to feed the \nmodel must be adjusted to the spatial and temporal \ndynamics of the processes occurring in the target \nwatershed.  the input data (cartographic databases \n\u2013 data layers and tabular data) are inserted through \nan appropriate interface.  the required layers are: \ndigital elevation model (deM); soil type; land use/\nmanagement, and watershed limits.  the interface \ndeveloped between swat and arcgis\u00ae, in addition \nto facilitating data input in the model, automatically \nsubdivides the watershed into sub-sections based \non the deM and the drainage network, and then \nlists the input data for each sub-watershed.  this \ninterface also enables the display of the model \noutput data as maps, charts and tables.\n\nthe relief of the watershed was obtained by \ngeoreferencing and scanning of topographic maps \n(Brasil, 1979), scale 1:50.000, with 20 m intervals \nbetween the topographic contour lines.  Using the \narcview\u00ae topogrid tool, contour lines were inferred \n(hutchinson, 1996), generating the numerical \nterrain model (Mnt) with altitudes ranging from \n560 to 750 m asl.  By applying the swat model, \nthe arvorezinha watershed was subdivided into \nthree sub-basins.  the criterion for the subdivision \nwas a minimum area of 6 ha.  thus, the model \nautomatically sets the confluences that delimit areas \ngreater than those specified by the user.\n\nland use and soil management data over five years \nwere used, but the different uses and delineation of \nplots invalidated the continuous simulation of five \nyears of data.  this occured because the swat model \nonly allows for the entry of one land use and soil \nmanagement map.  therefore, each year was simulated \nseparately.  land use and soil management maps \nwere obtained from annual surveys, with the aid of \na gPs with an accuracy of \u00b1 20 m.  all fields in the \nwatershed were included in these surveys and use \nand management data for each area were collected.  \nthen the data were entered into arcgis\u00ae and later \ninto swat.  details of all procedures employed in \nthe use of the swat model related to this article \nwere described in detail by Uzeika (2009).\n\n\n\nr. Bras. ci. solo, 36:557-565, 2012\n\n560 talita Uzeika et al.\n\ntable 1 shows the main land uses and soil \nmanagement in the arvorezinha watershed for the \nfive years of simulated data and changes in land use \nand soil management.\n\nfor the simulations performed annually without \ncalibration, data from the two years before the \nevaluated year was used.  this strategy was used \nfor model warming (stability) during the interactive \nprocedures to obtain results.  to validate the model, \nthe nash-sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (nse) was \nused (nash &amp; sutcliffe, 1970), as this statistic has \nbeen widely used in validation of the swat model \n(gassman et al., 2007).\n\nresUlts and discUssion\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, a number of agricultural \npractices of soil and water conservation (cover crops \ncombined with minimum tillage) were introduced \nby rural extension agents.  these practices were \nthen gradually adopted by farmers, resulting in a \nreduction in erosion and sediment yield (Minella et \nal., 2008) and improved soil quality.\n\nsuface and total runoff\n\ntable 2 shows the values of the nse for daily \nand monthly runoff simulations and the total flow \ndischarge for the five years of simulation.  the nse \nvalues for daily runoff were unsatisfactory for all \nyears of simulation.  the daily simulations of total \nflow discharge were slightly higher, but the nse \nvalues show a low relation between the simulated \nand observed values.  the main limitation of swat \nto represent the variables on a daily scale is related \nto the short, rapid rainfall events that occur in small \nheadwater watersheds (Minella et al., 2011).  these \n\nevents are characterized by complex hydrographs \nthat are highly dependent on rainfall characteristics.  \non a monthly scale, the errors, both over and under-\nestimated, are compensated, resulting in a better fit \nwith the observed values.\n\nthe nse values may vary from - ? to 1.  a perfect \nfit between simulated and observed values (slope = \n1 and the independent term = 0) was attributed to \nthe value 1.  a negative nse value indicates that the \nmean values observed predict more adequately than \nthe model used (nash &amp; sutcliffe, 1970).  Moriasi \net al. (2007) suggested that a nse greater than \n0.50 should be considered suitable for hydrologic \nsimulations in terms of monthly time scales, while \nfor the daily scale this value could be slightly lower, \nand necessarily higher than 0.50 when considering \nthe annual time scale.\n\nnse runoff simulation values are more realistic \non a monthly scale than when compared on a daily \nscale, with the exception of 2004, when the nse \nvalue was extremely low (0.02).  in total monthly \nrunoff simulations, nse values were also higher \nwhen compared to the daily values.  the nse values \nfor simulations of total flow discharge in 2004 were \nsignificantly worse than in other years, which may \nbe due to a smaller volume of rainfall that year \n(table 2).  in monthly flow discharge simulations \nfor 2006, which was also a year with a below-\naverage rainfall, this trend was also confirmed.  for \nthat same year, however, the total flow discharge \nsimulation showed a satisfactory nse value (0.79).  \nthe fact that the model adequately simulated \ntotal monthly flow discharge, without calibration, \nshows a positive aspect of swat.  however it is \nalso worth mentioning that or the total rainfall, the \nhydrograph separation line of rainfall excess (runoff) \nfrom baseflow is a complex process associated with \ngreat uncertainty.  this is due to a significant \ninterflow (lateral water flow that returns to the land \n\ntable 1. land use and soil management in the arvorezinha watershed during the simulated period\n\nland use\narea (%)\n\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n\nforest 52.7 42.3 38.0 33.5 33.5\n\nPasture 15.2 12.0 8.7 8.6 9.0\n\ntobacco conventional tillage 24.6 37.4 28.9 16.9 18.2\n\ntobacco minimum tillage - - 4.2 17.2 16.8\n\ntobacco no-tillage - - 12.9 19.0 20.1\n\nBeans - - - 0.1 -\n\ncorn 7.5 8.3 5.2 2.6 -\n\nwater(1) - - 2.1 2.1 2.4\n\n(1) the water use was not computed for the years of 2002 and 2003 due to the low detail level in surveys.\n\n\n\nUse of the swat Model for hydro-sediMentologic siMUlation in a sMall...          561\n\nr.

(2007) analyzed the performance of the swat \nmodel using data from 115 papers published in \ndifferent parts of the world.  in this article, for \nthe work carried out in small watersheds (under \n30 km2), nse values for total flow discharge and \nrunoff simulations on a daily scale were also low \n(below 0.5).  however for hydrological simulations \nat the monthly scale, nse values were appropriate, \nindependent of whether the model had been \ncalibrated or not.  this shows that the results of the \nhydrological simulations carried out in this study are \nconsistent with other evaluations of swat.  another \nimportant aspect observed in the work of gassmann \net al. (2007) refers to the relationship between the \nwatershed area and the nse value.  higher nse \nvalues were observed in larger watersheds, which \ncan be justified by the difficulty of simulating small \nwatersheds.  in general, small watersheds have low \nconcentration time and low capacity to minimize the \npeak runnoff, similar to what was observed in the \narvorezinha watershed.\n\ntable 2.

Unlike \nobserved for both surface and total runoff, nse \nvalues indicate that the model was not able to \nreproduce the estimated daily and monthly sediment \nyield adequately for each evaluated year.  in general, \nthe swat model significantly overestimated \nsediment yield for both time scales.\n\ntable 4 shows the comparison of annual sediment \nyield simulations with the observed values.  \nsediment yield values were overestimated for all \nyears, especially for 2006.  considering the average \nsimulated and observed sediment yield values, the \nresults indicate a 5-fold overestimation.\n\ngassmann et al. (2007) report a series of data \non sediment yield simulated by swat in various \nwatersheds worldwide.  for small watersheds, \nwith the exception of one study (Muleta &amp; nicklow, \n2005), observed nse values have shown that the \nmodel could adequately simulate sediment yield on \ndaily, monthly and yearly time scales.  in addition, \nin two citations where swat was not calibrated \n(Machado &amp; Vettorazzi, 2003; tripathi et al., 2003), \nnse values were also adequate (nse > 0.5).\n\nViero et al. (2009), working in the arvorezinha \nwatershed and using the wateM/sedeM model \n\n(Van oost et al., 2000) found that this model \noverestimated the sediment yield between 16 and \n150 times, when compared with observed values.  \nthe authors attributed the results to two limiting \nfactors: the low quality of the deM, which did \nnot allow for an adequate representation of the \nmicrotopography of the watershed surface, and also \ndue to the fact that the wateM/sedeM model does \nnot simulate the erosion process that occurs in the \nfluvial channel.\n\nfactors related to the overestimation of sedi-\nment yield\n\nas previously mentioned, the results for sediment \nyield obtained in this study (tables 3 and 4) were \ndifferent from those results reported by gassmann \net al. (2007).  hydrological results simulated by \nswat on the daily scale showed limitations when \nused for small watersheds without calibration.  the \nresponse to rainfall in the arvorezinha watershed \nis characterized by a rapidly evolving hydrological \nprocess, with erosion within few hours between \nthe beginning of runoff and the falling limb of \nthe hydrograph.  thus, the proper representation \nof the hydrological process of a small watershed \nwould be linked to the model ability to simulate \nthis condition.  the time of concentration, the slope \nof the falling limb of the hydrograph and runoff \nvolume are key features to be incorporated into \nthe hydrologic simulation of small watersheds, to \nensure an adequate simulation of sediment yield.  \nas mentioned, the results of daily runoff simulations \nwere not satisfactory, which indicates mainly that \nthe estimation of the runoff by the model was not \ncorrect for the daily scale, since the rainfall events \noccur on a sub-daily time-scale.\n\nanother important aspect to be considered is the \nsimplification of the ls factor in swat calculations.  \nthe ls factor is calculated automatically from the \ndeM for each hydrological response unit (hrU) \nas follows: l represents the distance between the \nextreme points of hrU, while s is based on the \n\ntable 3. nse results for daily sediment yield from 2002 to 2006\n\nyear rainfall\nnse\n\ndaily sediment yield Monthly sediment yield\n\nmm\n\n2002 2,219 -12.20 -77.38\n\n2003 1,835 -17.36 -27.89\n\n2004 1,324 -7.77 -7.06\n\n2005 1,935 -9.82 -6.53\n\n2006 1,409 -145.58 -241.63\n\n\n\nUse of the swat Model for hydro-sediMentologic siMUlation in a sMall...          563\n\nr.

(2010), comparing different \nprocedures for calculating the ls factor in the \narvorezinha watershed, found important differences \nbetween simplified methods and methods that \ntake into account the spatial representation of \na watershed area.  the swat model would be \nmore robust in its estimation of sediment yield if \nthe ls factor could be replaced by methods that \nconsider the spatial representation of the area of a \nwatershed, according to the procedures proposed by \nMoore &amp; Burch (1986) or desmet &amp; govers (1996).  \nBenatto et al. (2006) used Usle and a sediment \ndelivery ratio (sdr) based on the watershed area \nto calculate sy for the arvorezinha watershed, \nwhere the ls factor was estimated using the \ncomputational procedure proposed by Moore &amp; \nBurch (1986).  results obtained were consistent \nwith the observed sediment yield in the watershed, \nwhich indicates that the Usle base for MUsle \nused in swat has the potential to simulate the \nerosion processes, as long as the complexity of the \nls factor is adequately represented and adjusted \nas a parameter of sediment emission, similar to \nthe sdr.\n\nan important consideration is also with regard \nto the process of transport of river sediment to the \nfluvial channel.  a positive aspect of the swat \nmodel is that it considers that the processes in \nthe drainage basin are linked with those that \noccur in the fluvial channel.  on the other hand, \nthe complexity of the processes occurring in the \n\nfluvial channel is simplified by the swat model \n(gassmann et al., 2007).  for example, when \nsimulating sediment yield in an hrU, which in \nturn is contained in a sub-basin, the entire sediment \nload mobilized in the Urh is transferred to the \nfluvial channel.  this rarely occurs in reality, \nbecause a significant proportion of the sediment \nis deposited between the drainage basin and the \nfluvial channel.  in the case of the arvorezinha \nwatershed, Moro (2011) calibrated the distributed \nerosion model liseM (limburg soil erosion Model), \nand found significant sediment deposition of eroded \nmaterial at the base of the slopes.  Using the cs-137 \ntechnique in the same watershed, Minella found \nthat from the total sediment load that is mobilized \nin the watershed, only 40 % is transferred to the \nfluvial channel.  thus, a possible source of error \nin estimating the observed sediment yield for the \narvorezinha watershed is related to the inability of \nthe model to simulate the process occurring between \nthe area of sediment deposition and the fluvial \nchannel.  in general, the deM available for small \nwatersheds are still quite limited in representing \nthe relief adequately and thereby erosion modeling, \nespecially of depositions.\n\nanother important factor to be considered \nis the need for model calibration.  in the U.s., \nwhere the model was developed from a large and \nrepresentative set of experimental watersheds, the \ndevelopers of the model suggest that it may be used \nwithout calibration.  however, results obtained in \nthis work indicate that for different climatic and \nphysiographic conditions without calibration, the \nsimulation may produce unsatisfactory results.\n\nthis is especially important for small watersheds \nwhere the processes of generating surface and erosive \nrunoff are non-linear.  at daily intervals, the swat \nmodel is unable to represent the complexity and \nmagnitude of the hydrographs and sedimentographs \n\ntable 4. simulation results of specific sy obtained by the swat model simulation and compared with \nthe observed values (2002 to 2006)\n\nyear rainfall\nsediment yield\n\ndifference\nobserved simulated\n\nmm t km-2 year-1  %\n\n2002 2,219 219 983 349\n\n2003 1,835 231 907 293\n\n2004 1,324 72 188 161\n\n2005 1,935 142 406 186\n\n2006 1,409 69 1,021 1,380\n\naverage 1,791* 147 701 474\n\n*: Mean annual long-term rainfall.\n\n\n\nr.
