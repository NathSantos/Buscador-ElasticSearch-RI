A ocorr\u00eancia de ondas migrantes de sedimentos atuais nesta \u00e1rea foi relatada anteriormente, com base na batimetria multifeixe, mas aqui relatamos pela primeira vez, a nosso conhecimento, a ocorr\u00eancia de ondas migrantes f\u00f3sseis nessa regi\u00e3o, reveladas pelos perfis de reflex\u00e3o s\u00edsmica. Ondas migrantes de sedimentos foram observadas nos perfis s\u00edsmicos CIRCEE-HR complementados por batimetria multifeixe. 3 campos principais de ondas de sedimentos, tanto f\u00f3sseis como ativos foram identificados com v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es de ondas de sedimentos com diferentes comprimentos de onda e amplitudes. Na aus\u00eancia de idades bem constrangidas para calibrar os perfis s\u00edsmicos na \u00e1rea de estudo, e de forma a atribuir idades tentativas aos v\u00e1rios epis\u00f3dios de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de ondas de sedimentos, foi realizada uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o geral dos principais refletores s\u00edsmicos e de eventos bem datados, que foram correlacionados entre os v\u00e1rios perfis s\u00edsmicos. Dois modelos principais de forma\u00e7\u00e3o foram propostos para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas de sedimentos nesta \u00e1rea. Para o Campo de Ondas de Sedimentos C, mais setentrional, embora n\u00e3o se possa descartar uma poss\u00edvel origem relacionada ao spillover de canal turbid\u00edtico, parece que as ondas internas solit\u00e1rias geradas no Estreito de Messina podem ser o mecanismo respons\u00e1vel mais prov\u00e1vel. No entanto, no que diz respeito aos dois campos a sul, A e B, embora n\u00e3o seja poss\u00edvel excluir o poss\u00edvel papel das ondas internas ou a interac\u00e7\u00e3o dos canais turbiditos com as correntes de fundo, n\u00e3o existem observa\u00e7\u00f5es da presen\u00e7a de nenhum deles nesta \u00e1rea. Portanto, propomos que as ondas de sedimentos f\u00f3sseis foram formadas por spillover dos canais turbid\u00edticos, produzindo ondas de sedimento aproximadamente perpendiculares ou obl\u00edquas ao canal principal. O canal turbid\u00edtico principal, que agora segue aproximadamente a frente de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o, parece ter sido antes localizado mais ao norte. Isto pode ser uma indica\u00e7\u00e3o de que a migra\u00e7\u00e3o para o sul do prisma acrecion\u00e1rio associado ao roll-back da subdu\u00e7\u00e3o parou a forma\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas de sedimento, que s\u00e3o atualmente formadas muito mais ao sul. No campo B, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas de sedimento parece ter parado completamente em algum momento h\u00e1 cerca de 400kyr, embora este processo tenha come\u00e7ado localmente h\u00e1 cerca de 700kyr. Interpretamos isso como ligado \u00e0 migra\u00e7\u00e3o para sul do canal turbiditico principal que segue aproximadamente a frente de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o, causada pelo roll-back da subduc\u00e7\u00e3o.\nacknowledgments\tFirst of all, I thank Professor Lu\u00eds Menezes for the opportunity to work and learn under his guidance.

The occurrence of presently active migrating sediment waves in this area was previously reported, based on multibeam bathymetry, but here we report for the first time to our knowledge, the occurrence of fossil migrating waves in this region, imaged by seismic reflection profiles. Migrating sediment waves were identified on the CIRCEE-HR seismic profiles complemented by multibeam bathymetry. 3 main fields of sediment waves, both fossil and active were identified with several generations of sediment waves with different wavelengths and amplitudes. In the absence of borehole constrained age interpretations of seismic profiles in the study area, and in order to assign tentative dates to the various episodes of sediment wave formation, an overall interpretation of the main seismic reflectors and of well dated events was carried out and correlated between the various seismic profiles. Two main models of formation were proposed for the formation of the sediment waves in this area. For the northernmost Sediment Wave Field C, although a possible origin related to turbidite channel spillover cannot be ruled out, it appears that solitary internal waves generated at the Messina Strait may be the more likely responsible mechanism. As concerns the two southern fields A and B, however, although the possible role of internal waves or the interaction of turbidite channels with bottom currents cannot be ruled out, there are no reported observations of their presence of neither of them in this area. Therefore, we propose that the fossil sediment waves have been formed by turbidite channel spillover, producing sediment waves approximately perpendicular or oblique to the main turbidite channel. The turbidite channel that now approximately follows the deformation front appears to have been before located further north, this may be an indication that the migration to the south of the accretionary wedge associated with the subduction rollback has stopped the formation of the sediment waves, which are at present formed much further south. In field B, the formation of the sediment waves appears to have completely stopped sometime at about 400kyr, although this process started locally at about 700mMyr. We interpret this as linked to the migration to the south of the turbidite channel that approximately follows the edge of the deformation front, caused by the subduction rollback.\nContents\nAgradecimentos\nPalavras-Chave\nResumo\nAcknowledgments\nKeywords\nAbstract\nContents\nList of Figures\nChapter I.

Further basinward into the\ncontinental rise where sediment wave field 2 is develop, turbidity currents are diluted and along-slope bottom currents are the dominant processes.

This research work was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Lu\u00eds Menezes Pinheiro, from the University of Aveiro. All the processing and interpretation of the seismic data presented in this work was carried out at the Marine Geology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro.\n1.2\tObjectives\nThe main objective of this thesis was to investigate, characterize and try to understand the formation of the migrating sediment waves that were identified on a set of high resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles acquired in the Ionian Sea in the scope of the CIRCEE Cruise, and to propose possible models for their formation and abandonment. Specific objectives were: (1) to reprocess selected multichannel seismic profiles to obtain good quality images of the subsurface geology, and in particular to improve the imaging in the deeper part of the seismic sections; this involved learning multichannel seismic data processing, getting familiar with the SPW seismic processing software and implementing the more adequate processing flows; (2) to perform an overall interpretation of selected seismic reflection profiles in the study area and to assign tentative ages to the main reflectors; (3) to characterize the various generations of sediment waves (both active and fossil) in the study area and compare them with similar occurrences elsewhere; (3) to propose a model for their formation and for their abandonment.\n1.3\tThe CIRCEE-HR Survey\nThe main purpose of this survey was to conduct a study of the neo-tectonics in the accretionary wedge of the Calabrian subduction zone, a region struck repeatedly by some of the most destructive earthquakes in European history. The main objectives of this scientific cruise were to seek evidence of active faults associated with these structures, and to characterize the degree of activity of the Calabria accretionary wedge (sedimentary deformation, dewatering processes and the thermal regime), in order to better assess its seismogenic potential. Another major objective was to try to determine the typical recurrence interval for large earthquakes in the region (by coring and dating of turbidites).\nThe applied methods were high-resolution seismic and sub-bottom profiling (chirp), bathymetric swath mapping, gravity coring of the turbidite deposits with simultaneous heat-flow measurements.\nI.4\tDataset\nThe dataset used for this work, kindly made available by the CIRCEE Cruise Chief Scientist, Dr. Marc-Andre Gutscher, from the Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, France, consisted at 18 multichannel seismic reflection profiles (with a total extension of 1505 km) and a multibeam bathymetry cover acquired in the Ionian Sea, East offshore of Sicily, during the CIRCEE-HR cruise (Figure I.1).\nI.5\tMethodology\nIn order to accomplish the main objectives, two different methodologies were adopted: one for the seismic data processing and the other for the seismic data interpretation.\nSeismic Data Processing\nThe processing of the seismic profiles was performed with the Seismic Processing Workshop 3 (SPW3), from Parallel Geoscience Corporation. After getting familiar with the main steps of multichannel seismic data processing and with the architecture of this software, a processing flow was designed to improve the preliminary onboard seismic processing of selected profiles. The raw SEG-Y seismic data were fully processed to achieve high quality seismic images in depth, particularly in the areas where the migrating sediment waves have been identified. The main processing steps consisted of: pre-processing Quality Control, Geometry Assignment, Frequency Filtering, Velocity Analysis, CMP sorting and Post-Stack time migration.\nSeismic Interpretation\nThe seismic interpretation of the seismic profiles was carried out using the Kingdom Suite 2015, seismic and geological interpretation software from IHS Markit Corporate, to whom we thank the licenses donation to the University of Aveiro. The seismic profiles that cross the Ionian abyssal plain and the deformation front of the accretionary wedge were the first to be interpreted; in this area, the correlation of the main seismic horizons between the different lines was possible whereas the spacing between the other 2D seismic lines made such a correlation more difficult and less reliable. As the interpretation advanced to the western profiles, the focus was on the identification, mapping and characterization of the sediment waves that were observed in eight profiles, which became the main objective of this study. A more detailed interpretation was carried out in these areas in order to understand the different stages of formation of the sediment waves.\n3\nI.6\tStructure of this thesis\nThis thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter briefly introduces the reader to the nature and scope of this work, the main objectives, the scientific survey, the dataset and the methodology used. It ends with this brief description of the thesis structure.\nThe second chapter presents the study area, its geographical location, describes the geological and tectonic setting, particularly the Calabrian Accretionary Wedge and the main turbidite deposits.\nThe third chapter introduces in general the fundamentals and some important concepts of the multichannel seismic reflection method, including the marine seismic acquisition geometry and the necessary equipment (sources and receivers).\nThe fourth chapter starts with a brief description of the seismic data processing default flowchart for 2D seismic data, followed by a description of the geometry and acquisition parameters, adopted on the CIRCEE-HR survey, and the preliminary onboard processing flow. This chapter concludes with a detailed description of seismic processing flows used in the scope of this work to improve the seismic imaging, and a comparison of the final processed section with the previous onboard processing.\nThe fifth chapter describes briefly the global significance, formation mechanisms and classification of the migrating sediment waves. Case studies are presented.\nThe sixth chapter describes and characterizes in detail the migrating sediment waves observed in the CIRCEE-HR seismic profiles, and concludes with a proposed model for their formation.\nChapter seven presents the main conclusions of this work and several suggestions about possible future work.\nChapter II. Study Area\nII.1\tGeographical Location\nThe study area is located in the Ionian Sea, South of Italy and East of Sicily (Figure II.1). It is bounded by the parallels 35\u00b024\u2019N and 38O12\u2019N and by the meridians 15\u00b0E and 18\u00b024\u2019E.\nFigure II.1 - Geographical location of the study area (red square). Topographic and bathymetric map adapted from Tontini et al. (2007).\nII.2\tGeological and Tectonic Setting\nII.2.1\tTectonic Evolution of the Western and Central Mediterranean since\nthe Cretaceous\nThe whole Mediterranean region was subjected to a large-scale rapid pulse of inplane compressional stress during the Late Cretaceous (~ 95-85 Myr). This event is marked by large scale folding. Soon after this widespread compressional episode, the first evidence of the formation of a trench and the subduction process along the northern, Iberian-European margin occur (Faccenna et al., 2001),\n5\nFaccenna et al. (2001) propose a model that discerns the evolution of the Central Mediterranean subduction zone into three phases (Figure II.2): (1) slow initiation, characterized by very low subduction speeds, (2) slab development with a roughly exponential increase of subduction speed and opening of a first back-arc basin; and (3) slow-down due to interaction of the slab with the 660 km transition zone.\nFigure II.2 - Reconstruction, in three phases, of the subduction process along A-A' cut, where it is represented the basins associated with the subduction and its rollback. Modified from Faccenna et al. (2001).\nThe first phase (80 to 30-35 Myr) is characterized by a very low velocity of subduction (an average of 0.8 cm/yr). Arc volcanism developed when the slab reached a depth of 200-300 km, attaining a shallow dip (Faccenna et al., 2001).\nIn the second phase (30-35 to 15 Myr), the velocity of subduction and the slab dip increased rapidly; consequently, the arc volcanism increased too. The opening of the back-arc basins gradually starts from north to south (Faccenna et al., 2001; Figure II.3). The first ones began to form, in the Late Oligocene, in the Golf of Lyon, in the Ligurian Sea and in the Valencia Trough. In the Early Miocene, the back-arc extension spread on to the Provencal, Algerian and Alboran basins. The extension in the Western Mediterranean was primarily controlled by the rollback of the subduction zone (Rosenbaum et al., 2002).\nFigure II.3 - Reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of the Western Mediterranean since the\nOligocene (adapted from Rosenbaum et al., 2002).\nIn the third phase (last 15 Myr) the slab reaches the 660 km transition zone. To the south, the slab is deformed due a pause in the subduction (for about 5 Myr) and the subsequent acceleration of the rollback during the opening of the Tyrrhenian back-arc basin, in the Late Miocene (Faccenna et al., 2001).\nRifting led to breakup of continental terranes, which drifted and rotated as long as the subduction zone continued to rollback. Subduction rollback temporally or permanently ceased when continental crust arrived at the subduction zone, impeding subduction processes. The continental terranes have then been accreted to the continents and considerable crustal shortening occurred (Rosenbaum et al., 2002).\n7\nII.2.2\tThe Calabrian Accretionary Wedge\nThe Calabrian accretionary wedge is a 400 km long and 300 km wide structure, located southeast of Calabria and to the east of Sicily. It is confined between the NNW-SSE trending and 250 km long Malta escarpment and the NW-SE trending Apulian escarpment (Gallais et al., 2012). The Calabrian accretionary wedge developed due to the SE-NW Africa/Eurasia convergence, presently occurring at a very slow rate of about 5 mm/yr or even lower (Polonia etal., 2011).\nBased on figures II.4 and II.5, five different morphological domains can be distinguished (from the SE to the NW). An undeformed area beneath the Ionian abyssal plain, distinct from the deformed Calabrian accretionary wedge, located directly to the NW, which comprises the other four domains: the frontal slope, the upper slope, the crest of the wedge and the inner plateau, directly SE of Calabria (Gallais et al., 2012).\nThe Ionian Abyssal Plain is characterized as a deep triangular basin, roughly defined by the 4000 m depth isobath, bounded to the south by the Medina seamounts. It is a nearly flat domain despite some relief evidences such as the Victor Hensen Seahill and the Victor Hensen Seahill 2 (see Figure II. 5 for location; Gallais etal., 2012).\nWest and east of the undeformed Ionian Abyssal Plain, the first evidences of deformation are notorious by the increasing roughness of the seafloor (Figure II.4). This morphological change marks the boundary between the undeformed Ionian Abyssal Plain and the frontal slope domain of the Calabrian wedge to the west and of the Western Mediterranean Ridge to the east (Polonia et al., 2011). These boundaries correspond to the deformation fronts of the two accretionary wedges. Short-wavelength folds are well-expressed in the frontal slope, to the NW of the Ionian abyssal plain. These folds vary between 5 and 12 km in lateral extension and show a rather consistent axial N55 trend but veering to N90 further west. To the west, these folds become less well-expressed and a patchwork of small-scale asperities characterizes the seafloor morphology (Gallais et al., 2012).\nAlfeo \\\nSpamount\n\u25a0\" Ionian\n\"\u2019r'z\n- 139-N-x'^\n\u25a0 \u25a0 . ..\nSWZ'J\nApulian plateau %\nV/K.\n36\u2019N\nO)J r* W 37*N\n[ 38\u2018N\nSicily\n-KW -JWO -2W0 -1W0\nBathymetry (m)\n.....................\n\nFigure II.4 - Morpho-structural map of the Calabrian accretionary wedge and its adjacent regions.

Black lines: location of the canyons. White lines: location of the multichannel seismic profiles from Archimede cruise (adapted from Gallais etal., 2012).\nThe frontal slope is a 45-55 km wide domain. It extends approximately from 4000 m to 3800 m depth, directly NW of the Ionian Abyssal Plain and widens to the W from 4000 m to 3500 m depth. The western boundary of this domain terminates against the Alfeo seamount, a small plateau located 30 km east of the Malta escarpment (Gallais et al., 2012).\n9\nThe boundary between the frontal slope and the upper slope is defined by occurrence of deep gashes on the seafloor, reaching 4000 m depth and separated by bumps (called the cobblestone topography). These gashes represent zones, where the Plio-Quaternary sediments are absent and the Messinian evaporites rise locally as diapirs and pierce to the seafloor. This boundary is difficult to follow to the SW; so, the location of this boundary is based on the observation of the roughness of the seafloor on the seismic profiles (Gallais et al., 2012).\nThe upper slope extends approximately from 3600 m to 3000 m depth. Landward, the seafloor morphology is characterized as a relativity flat domain, referred as the \u201cslope terrasse\u201d (Polonia et al., 2011; Gallais et al., 2012).\nThe 3000 m isobaths delineate a small scarp that marks the boundary between the upper slope. Recently, Polonia et al. (2011) outlined that the Calabrian accretionary wedge could be segmented longitudinally along a NW/SE trending diffuse boundary that is considered to be a major deformation zone (Figure II.6). To the NE of this zone, an elevated area of the crest of the wedge, located in the \u201ceastern lobe\u201d of the Calabrian prism, and representing a 75 km wide bulge, is observed, affected by SW-NE trending egg-shaped depressions that lie at an average depth of 3500 m. To the SW of the deformation zone, the depressed area, located in the \u201cwestern lobe\u201d represents a wide nearly flat basin at the toe of the 3000 m depth isobaths. Gallais et al. (2012) suggest that the NW/SE trending lineament may not represent a major deformation zone. They propose the different elevations of the two lobes to be linked with the collision between the Calabrian prism and the Mediterranean Ridge, occurring SE of the elevated domain.\nThe inner plateau is located above the 2000 m depth contours (Polonia et al., 2011). It is a homogenous domain, with several kilometer-scale bumps. This area has been intensively studied because of its mud volcanoes\u2019 activity.\nupper slope\nMoho\npre-Messiniaiy^vedge\nfrontal . r undeformed slope -room\t4000n\nareO \\.\nPlio-Quaternary sediments\tBase of the Messinian Mobile Unit (thick line:decollement level)\nPost-evaporitic sediments\t\u2014 Base of theTortonian\nPre-Messinian clastic wedge\t\t Top of the Mesozoic\n-At Mud volcanoes\tTop of the Ionian oceanic crust\n[ A * Oceanic crust\t\nn inner\n1000 m .\t-2000 m\n-\u2014? ateau S .crest of the wedge\nFigure II.5 - Schematic 3D view of the Calabrian accretionary wedge.

CTZ: Central Transition Zone (adapted from Gallais etal., 2012).\n11\nThe Calabrian accretionary wedge can also be divided into two important structural domains: the pre-Messinian and the post-Messinian wedges (Figure II.6; Polonia et al., 2011). The pre-Messinian wedge is located in the inner zone, in the north, and it is constituted by clastic materials from Upper Cretaceous to pre-Messinian (see Figure II.5). The post-Messinian wedge, known as the \u201csalt wedge\u201d too, is located in the most external zone of the Calabrian accretionary wedge, in the south, and it is constituted exclusively by Messinian and Plio-Quaternary deposits. A basal decollement was identified on base of the Messinian deposits. Despite of certain ambiguity, it is proposed that the boundary between these two domains occurs over a \u201cmain external ramp\u201d (Minelli &amp; Faccenna, 2010) or a \u201csplay fault\u201d (Polonia etal., 2011; Gallais etal., 2012; Gutscher etal., 2015).\nResearchers have been seeking for the lithospheric scale tear fault associated with subduction rollback, presumably located offshore eastern Sicily (Figures II.4 and II.6). Many have proposed the Malta Escarpment to be the active tear fault, primarily due to its striking morphological expression as a 3-4km high step on the seafloor. The exact geometry and degree of activity of the network of faults offshore Sicily remains uncertain and highly controversial; so, there is no consensus on the surface expression of the \u201cSTEP\u201d fault (subvertical tear fault). Recently, Gutscher et al. (2015) interpreted a two-part fault system as the shallow tectonic expression of a lithospheric scale lateral slab tear (STEP fault), based in new high-resolution seismic profiles and detailed morphobathymetry (Figure II.7).\nII.2.3\tMain turbidite episodes\nThe turbidite currents have played an important role in recent geological history of the Ionian Sea: between 93% and 95% of sediments from Holocene and Late Pleistocene were deposited by turbidite currents, unleashed mainly by regional seismic activity (Polonia et al., 2013). Between the several turbidites that have been identified in the Ionian Sea basin, the mega-turbidites are the ones that deserve special attention because they are indicators of soil acceleration due to seismic events, impacts of tsunamis waves in the seafloor, volcanic activity, sea level changes, phase changes and gas hydrates dissociation, or even the combination of any of these processes (Polonia et al., 2013).\nsrwu\nc.b. circular basin\nSyracuse\nMalta escarpment Fold/ridge axis Trough axis Sedimentary structure Strike-slip Fault Normal Fault\nInferred Fault\nIONIAN SEA\nSimplified tectonic interpretation\nAugusta\n<1\nHyblean C'^' Plateform .\nETNA\n1 . >\nSICILY \u00a3\nFigure II.7 - Morphobathymetric interpretation map, in east offshore Sicily, showing: position of CIRCEE-HR seismic profiles (straight black lines), sediment waves (alternating green and blue lines), accretionary wedge anticlines and synclines (black and green lines), likely faults (red lines), the upper and lower limits of the Malta Escarpment (orange lines), flat lying sedimentary basins (yellow shading), and earthquake focal mechanisms from a published study [Musumeci et al., 2014].

The HAT and the DTL ages were reconstructed trough 14C dating and they are about 1651 yr b.p. and 14000 yr b.p., respectively (Polonia et al., 2013). Using the average sedimentation rate for the Pleistocene in the Ionian Abyssal Plain (about 15 cm/1000 years; Cita et al., 1978), Hieke (2000) roughly estimated the age of TTL to about 650 kyr \u00b1 100 kyr.\nFigure II.8 - Chirp echosounder profile 58 showing three major turbidity deposits as acoustically transparent layers (CIRCEE data). In green: Homogenite/Augias turbidite (SanPedro et al., 2016).\nThe Augias mega-turbidite\nThe Augias mega-turbidite, also designated \u201chomogenite\u201d (due to the sediment homogeneity), was described for the first time by Hieke et al. (1975). It is characterized by a significant content in aragonite, which is restricted only to this turbidite (Hieke &amp; Werner, 2000). Its thickness varies between 20 to 25 meters (Polonia et al., 2013). The Augias covers the Ionian and Sirte Abyssal Plains and the lowermost slopes of the adjacent Calabrian and Sirte Rises and the Mediterranean Ridge (Figure II.9; Hieke &amp; Werner, 2000).\nThe first hypothesis about the formation of this mega-turbidite pointed to the eruption of Santorini (3500 years ago) as the trigger event. The evolution of tsunami modelling led to question of the effectiveness of the tsunami wave generated by the Santorini caldera collapse, especially outside the Aegean Sea. Thus, it was proposed that the Augias was generated by a tsunami driven by the collapse of eastern flank of the Etna Volcano (7600 years ago). After several criticisms to these hypotheses it was suggested the possibility of this megaturbidite be related with an important earthquake in Crete in 365 DC (Polonia et al., 2013).\nIAP: Ionian Abyssal Plain ; SAP: Syrte Abyssal Ionian ; GS: Golf of Sirte\nNew distribution of the Augias deposit\no Distribution of the Augias deposit (Hieke et al., 2000).

Red stars represent the hypothesized epicenters for the origin of the Augias deposit (adapted from San Pedro etal., 2016).\nPolonia et al. (2013) concluded, after a careful study, that the event that caused the formation of the Augias happened between 215 and 530 AD, thus excluding the first hypotheses of the eruptions of Santorini and Etna. Indeed, the only historical earthquake potentially capable of generating devastating effects in the Ionian Sea, in the Sirte abyssal plain and in the Herodotus Trough during the given time interval was the Cretan 365 AD earthquake.\n15\nChapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method\nIII.1\tBasic Principles and Fundamentals\nIn the seismic reflection method, the structure of the subsurface geological formations is mapped by measuring the time required for a seismic wave (or pulse) emitted at or near surface to return to the surface after reflection on the interfaces between formations, which have different physical and acoustical properties (density and P-wave velocity). The incident wave at an interface is split into a reflected and a refracted part (Figure III.1), according to the Snell\u2019s Law (Equation 1):\nVi\nV2\n(Eq. 1)\nsill\nwhere Oi is the incident angle, Or is the refracted angle, and V1 and V2 represent the velocity of the seismic waves in two different media.\n17\nThe travel-time of the reflected waves from the source until they are recorded by the receivers is used to derive information about the subsurface geology, as well as the rock properties and the layers attitude. The time that a wave takes to travel since it is generated at the source, finds an interface between two layers with different density (p), seismic wave velocity (V), where it is reflected, and travels back to the surface where it is recorded by the receivers, it is called two-way travel-time (TWT). The Reflection Coefficient (RC) is proportional to the acoustic impedance (Z) contrast between two layers and is given by Equation 2 - for the case of normal incidence (for the general case it will depend on the angle of incidence and mode conversion has to be taken into account - see, for example, Yilmaz, 2001a):\np2 V2 \u2014 pi Vj _ z2 - Z\u00b1\nP2V2 + pi Vi Z2 + Zi\n(Eq. 2)\nThe seismic resolution is largely determined by the acquisition system characteristics, the acquisition geometry and the properties of the media of propagation. Subsequent processing can improve the image resolution within some limits. Therefore, seismic resolution is a matter of prime importance in seismic data acquisition (Yilmaz, 2001a).\nVertical resolution\nThe vertical resolution of a seismic wave is a measure of its ability to recognize individual, closely-spaced reflectors and is determined by the pulse length of the record seismic section. The vertical resolution increases with increasing wave frequency. Higher frequencies mean sharper pulses and therefore better vertical resolution. Two reflectors can be recognized as separated seismic events only if the distance between them is at least % of the wavelength (A) of the seismic wavelet, defined by (Equation 3):\nV\n(Eq. 3)\nwhere V is the seismic wave velocity in the layer and f is source frequency.\nThe frequency of waves transmitted into the Earth depends on the type and characteristics of the seismic source. However, the frequency changes as the waves travel in the subsurface and the seismic wave will lose higher frequencies in depth since they are more rapidly absorved. Therefore, high-frequencies waves are attenuated much faster than low-frequencies. The higher the frequency the lower will be the penetration, but the higher will be the vertical resolution.\nHorizontal resolution\nThe horizontal resolution of a seismic wave is mainly controlled by the so-called \u201cFirst Fresnel Zone\u201d (Figure III.2). The Huygens ' Principle states that each part of a wavefront acts as a source of a new wave and the area where the waves interfere with each other constructively is the area of interest, called the \u201cFirst Fresnel Zone\u201d (Sheriff, 1991, 1996). The radius of the First Fresnel Zone, FR, is given by:\nV it\n(Eq. 4) where V is the average seismic velocity on the layer, t is the wave two-way traveltime, and f is the frequency of the seismic waves. Thus, the Fresnel zone increases, and consequently horizontal resolution decreases, with increasing velocity, increasing travel-time (depth) and decreasing signal frequency.\nFigure III.2 - Schematic representation of the 1st Fresnel Zone. The energy is returned to the receiver from all points of the reflector. The part of the reflector which the energy is reflected within\n19\nIII.2\t2D Multichannel Seismic Reflection Surveys\nIn the 2D multichannel marine seismic acquisition a long seismic streamer of hydrophones and a seismic wave source are towed behind the seismic vessel. The streamer will receive and convert the reflected waves that come from the sea subsurface to an electrical signal. The reflections from the subsurface are assumed to come directly from below the navigation line performed by the research vessel.\nFigure III.3 - Typical 2D multichannel seismic reflection survey (modified from http://geostar-surveys.com).\nIII.2.1\tMarine Seismic Sources\nacoustic/pressure waves that are used in seismic reflection surveys. The primary pulse generated by an airgun is followed by a train of bubble pulses that increase the overall length of the pulse (McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988, Telford et al., 1990). This effect is called the \u201cbubble effect\u201d and it gives an oscillatory and, unsatisfactory reflection record. Special measures are adopted in the design of the seismic array and in the individual airguns time shooting, as well in the processing stage to attenuate the bubble oscillations.\nThe airguns used in the CIRCEE-HR survey were GI airguns (G - Generator; I -Injector). This type of sources was developed to reduce and suppress the bubble oscillation (Figure III.4 and III.5).\nFigure III.4 - In phase 1, the Generator is fired. The blast of compressed air produces the primary pulse and the bubble starts to expand. In the second phase, just before the bubble reaches its maximum size, the injector is fired, injecting air directly inside the bubble. At last, the volume of air released by the injector increases the internal pressure of the bubble and prevents its violent collapse. The oscillations of the bubble and the resulting secondary pressure pulses are reduced and reshaped (in www.sercel.com).\n21\n111.2.2\tMarine Seismic Receivers\nTo receive and record the seismic reflected waves a long hydrophone cable, called streamer, is used. This cable consists of a plastic tube, 5 to 8 cm in diameter, nearly neutrally buoyant and generally filled with querosene. The hydrophone elements, wires and transformers are stored inside the plastic tube, which is acoustically transparent and generally also optically transparent. The seismic wave passes through both the plastic tube and the oil and reaches the hydrophones without noticeable interference (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).\nWithin the hydrophone a piezoelectric transducer produces an electrical signal in response to the pressure changes caused by the passage through the surrounding water of the seismic pressure waves (Dobrin and Savit, 1988). Hydrophones are arranged in sections (\u201clive sections\u201d, or channels). Each hydrophone from each live section receives a seismic signal which is summed up together and the final result is considered the seismic record for that live section, receiver group or channel. With this summing (stacking) technique the signal to noise ratio is largely improved.\nThe streamer is divided into several components. Among the benefits of using streamer incorporations, such as lead-in sections, birds (to stabilize the streamer at a certain depth) as well as other noise-reducing design systems is that marine surveys can now be conducted at higher tow speeds and in rougher weather conditions; also improved signal to noise ratio is obtained, which allow the geophysicist to get deeper information and better imaging after data processing (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).\n111.2.3\tMulti-Fold Coverage Marine Seismic Acquisition\nMulti-fold coverage in a multichannel seismic survey, means that for different shots, the reflections from each reflecting point along the reflector interface are recorded in more than just one seismic trace.\ngeometry of acquisition is set in a way that a set of traces recorded at different offsets for different shots contains reflections from a common midpoint (CMP) on the same reflector. The CMP is the point at the surface located at half-offset between the source and the receiver that is common to several source-receiver pairs.\n3 km approx\nStrata\nCMP 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nO\nShot point 1\n\u25a0-<-\nt3 ----\nHy irophone sections numbered i to 48 (Z>\n23\nI\n24\t25\t26\t27\t2 8 29\t30\t31 I\ni i i i i i i i\u2014\n!4\t25\t26\t27\t28\t29\t30\t31\t32\t48\nJ>---i---1----\u25a0----ZZ----1--1----1---<\t\u2022\u2014|\nSi|------------------e\u2014 -\n--------------\n---------------------\ns4\t1\n---------o\t1 \u25a0\nS5\t1\n-------o\t\u25a0---\nSg 1\t2\n-----e--------\u25a0---*-\nS7\t1\t2\n\u2014e---------*----1\u2014\ns8 12\t3\nO\tI----\u2022--->\u2014\nShot number -------------1\n18\t19\t20\t21\t22\t:\n\u25a0\t\u00bb\t\u25a0\t\u00bb\t\u00bb\t_\n18\t19\t20\t21\t22\t23\nDistance along ship\u2019s course -\n1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\nq\t\u25a0_i_\u25a0_\u25a0_i-*-\u25a0\u2014\n1\t23456789\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 * \u25a0 j\n23456789\n\u2014,-e ,-,-\u00bb-.-*-1\u2014\n234\t56789\t10\nj-1-\u00ab-1-1-i-.-i-.\n3456\t789\t10\n_'\t\u25a0 S 1_1_'-1-L\u2014\n3456\t789\t10\t11\n\u25a0\t\u00bb_1 O 1\t1\t\u2018\t\u2018\n4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\n\u2014,-,-,-e ,-1-,-.\u2014\n4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\nj_i_i_\u25a0\t#\t-1---1--i\n\nt\nCommon Midpoint (CMP) Position\n23\nThe CMP gather (Figure III.7b) is formed by all the traces from the source-receiver (Si-Ri) pairs that correspond to the same common reflections points. The fold refers to the number of traces in the CMP gather that can be summed. It can be expressed as a percentage (e.g. six-fold = 600% fold coverage) or by the number of times the same CMP is sampled (e.g. 20-fold). So, the larger the fold the better will be the data quality.\nFigure III.7 - Shot-Receivers (Si-Ri) pairs that share the same reflection point (figure (a)) and an example of CMP gather of three S-R pairs (figure (b)). Modified from Kearey and Brooks (1991).\nSi-Ri S2-R2 S3-R3\nThis method brings a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, attenuating or almost suppressing totally the long-path multiples (Yilmaz, 1987; Kearey and Brooks, 1991; Yilmaz, 2001a). For inclined reflectors, the necessary corrections can be partially done through post-stack migration or correctly handled through pre-stack migration (Yilmaz, 2001a)\nIII.3\tThe Nature of Seismic Traces\nNowadays, the seismic trace corresponds to a digital signal that can be viewed as the convolution of a reflectivity function with a source wavelet, as shown on Figure\nIII.8.\tA negative reflection coefficient occurs at a decrease in acoustic impedance across an interface.\nFigure III.8 - The seismic trace as the convolution of the source wavelet by the subsurface reflectivity function (modified from Kearey and Brook, 1991).\nMultiple reflections\nWhen the incident wave reflects in more than one interface in its travel path it is called a \u201cmultiple\u201d. Two classes of multiples can be distinguished: long-path and short-path multiples (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). A long-path multiple is one whose travel path is long compared with primary reflections from the same deep interfaces, appearing as a separate event on a seismic record. Short-path multiples include the so-called ghost reflections (Figure III.9).\nFigure III.9 - Ray paths of some common multiples families (modified from Hatton et al., 1986).\n25\nCoherent noise\nAccording to Hatton et al. (1986) examples of coherent noise are: (1) direct waves,\n(2)\tdiffracted waves, (3) refracted waves, (4) vibrational noise and, (5) interference.\nThe common characteristic of this kind of noise is the line-up of energy in a distinguishable manner across the traces of a shot gather (Larner et al., 1983). 2D filtering techniques can be applied to attempt their attenuation.\nRandom Noise\nRandom noise exhibits no correlation from trace to trace, and no specific noise amplitude can be predicted from the knowledge of the generating mechanism. It can be generated by (1) Instrument noise, (2) Machinery, (3) Power lines, and (4) Cable noise.\nImprovements in the design of seismic vessels, instruments and cables are continually reducing the effect of the various types of noise described above. Methods of random noise reduction are based on averaging techniques and frequency filtering (Hatton et al., 1986).\nChapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the CIRCEE-HR Survey\nStandard seismic processing flows have been fully completely implemented and are well known in the academia and industry to increase the seismic vertical resolution, improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and display the seismic events in their correct spatial position, in order to obtain a better imaging of the desired geological information contained in the seismic data (McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Kearey and Brooks, 1991; Yilmaz, 2001a, b).\nA common basic processing flow for 2D seismic data (Figure IV.1) is ordinarily composed of a preprocessing stage involving demultiplexing (if required), quality control and trace editing, amplitude and geometry corrections, followed by a processing sequence which normally includes: deconvolution, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, CMP stack and migration (Yilmaz, 2001a).\nFigure IV.1 - Default seismic data processing flowchart (modified from Klemperer &amp; Peddy, 1992).\nMigration\n27\nduring the seismic data processing (Yilmaz, 2001a,b). For areas with complex geometry and where acquisition was carried out with long offsets to provide good velocity control, pre-stack migration processing can significantly improve the data, although at a computational cost.\nIV.1 Acquisition Parameters\nIn seismic data processing, the correct definition of the acquisition parameters is fundamental to obtain a good and accurate processed seismic profile. During the acquisition geometry assignment stage, parameters such as the shooting interval, the channel spacing and the source-receiver offset are extremely important, since without them the seismic processing cannot be correctly performed. Besides the parameters already mentioned, it is required to know the sampling interval and the record length of the acquisition system. The tow-depths of the seismic sources and the receivers are also needed to correct for the statics; the SEGY files provided for the seismic processing of this work already have this correction applied.\nThe acquisition parameters of the CIRCEE-HR scientific cruise and the sources and streamer configurations are schematically represented in Figure IV.2 and in Figure IV.3, respectively.\nLead-in cable (~ 50 m)\nTowing electro-optical cable\nSurvey vessel\nTowing speed - 4 knots\nSource towing system\n25 m\n11 m\n*\t\u2022\u201c<\tJ *\n24/24in3 24/24in3 24/24in3\nHead elastic sections (~ 50 m)\nIsolation of vessel\u2019s vibrations\nSeismic source\nAirguns Mechanical support\nPositioning system\nActive line sections (3 x 150 m)\nData acquisition\n13/13in3 13/13in3 13/13in3\nTowing cable + umbilical (high-pressure air)\n6 Gl airguns\tAirgun in service\nTotal volume: ULIn! ^|| > Airgun in reserve\nShot cadence: 6 s\n+ 50 m (tail rope)\nTailbuoy\n-\tGPS, radar deflector\n-\tVHF data transmission\nTail elastic sections (~ 50 m)\n- Isolation of tai I buoy\u2019s vibrations ta\"^\nV\n6 25 m 24 traces 1ALS&lt;24 x 3 = 72>\n------- 8 hydrophones I trace (8 x 72 = 576)\nBirds (4)\n-\tDepth measurementand control \\\n-\tCompass heading information \\\nFigure IV.3 - Seismic sources and streamer configuration of the CIRCEE-HR multichannel survey\n(Gutscher et al., 2013, 2015; modified from www.flotteoceanographique.fr).\nIV.2 Preliminary Onboard Data Processing\nPreliminary seismic data processing of all the 2D multichannel seismic lines acquired during the CIRCEE-HR survey was performed onboard during the acquisition cruise using the following software: (1) the SISPEED v5.2 software (Ifremer), used in the quality control (QC), and (2) the Seismic Unix software package used in the subsequently seismic data processing steps (filtering, stacking and time migration). This preliminary processing was performed by L. M. Pinheiro (University of Aveiro) and B. M. de Lepinay (National Center of Scientific Research, Nice), responsible for seismic data processing on the second leg of the survey.\nEighteen seismic profiles (representing a total of 1505 km) were acquired in the CIRCEE-HR survey. Due to computational limitations most of those profiles were divided into two or three sections, thus making the data processing more convenient. The seismic lines were recorded in demultiplexed SEG-D format which consists of one file per shot. All files contain a general header (usually\n29\nThe adopted onboard processing flow was composed by the following stages: (1) navigation processing; (2) source location; (3) quality control and spectral analysis; (4) delay estimation of the sources (air guns' synchronization); (5) conversion of the SEG-D files to SEG-Y; applying a 20-800Hz filter for frequency preservation; (6) common depth point (CDP) calculation; binning and fold determination; (7) CMP gather visualization to determine the NMO's constant velocity (it was used an velocity of 1540m/s); (8) CMP stacking and filtering (70-425Hz); (9) Stolt migration, with a constant velocity of 1540 m/s; (10) sea bottom picking and mute; (11) signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) determination.\nIV.3 Seismic Data Re-Processing\nOne of the objectives of this thesis was to learn the seismic processing techniques, become familiar with standard processing software and reprocess the original multichannel seismic data to try to improve the imaging quality, particularly in the deeper parts of the sections, since the upper part is already very well imaged. The short maximum offsets recorded, however, strongly limit the improvement of the imaging quality. For seismic processing, the Seismic Processing Workshop software (SPW), version 3, from Parallel Geoscience Corporation, was used. One of the first tasks in this thesis was therefore to get familiar with this software and implement the adequate processing flows.\nAs an example of the flowcharts used, we show below those used for the seismic profile 14.\nIV.3.1 Flow 01 - Import\nThe processing flow 01 - Import is composed by the following processes: SEGY Import, Clipping, Trace Sample Math, Resample Seismic and Apply Static Shifts.\nSEGY Import\nSPW 3 uses the SEG Y format as its internal processing file format, although data may be read in from other formats, such as SEG 2 and SEG D. By default, the SEG Y Standard format file delivered as part of the SPW 3 installation is used for decoding the SEG Y files.\nIn Processing Categories, the Seismic Data step was first selected, followed by SEG Y Import. A double click on this last item opens the SEG Y Import Dialog (Figure IV.4). The SEG Y seismic file to be used was selected (profil141.seg) and the SEG Y Index was rebuilt. An index file is created for each SEG Y file used in SPW. These files contain important information used in the processing and are required for processing and display. From the list of SEG Y index fields, three were selected: Trace sequential number, Field file number and Channel number. After that, the SEG Y Index was ready to be rebuilt. It was saved in XML file format.\nFigure IV.4 - The SEG Y Import dialog in SPW 3 flowchart.\n31\nFigure IV.5 - Running the import flow and displaying the seismic file.\nIn the shot gather display and channel display, odd amplitude values in the original file also appeared in the SEG Y Import dialog. Therefore, it was not possible to visualize the data in True Amplitude (Figure IV.6). It was observed that the reference value of amplitude was too high. It was therefore necessary to reduce this reference value; probably it is one, or just a few, very high amplitude values, which have influenced the amplitude and visualization. The data was hence rapidly analyzed in relative amplitude (Figure IV.7 and IV.8).\nFigure IV.6 - Shot gather display for profile 14, using True Amplitude.\nFigure IV.7 - Shot gather display from Figure IV.6 using Relative Amplitude.\nFigure IV.8 - Channel gather display for profile 14, using Relative Amplitude.\nThe anomalous values were corrected (Figure IV.9) and a new processing step was added to the flow for this purpose.\n33\nFigure IV.9 - SEG Y Import dialog (at the left) and Seismic File dialog (at the right). Correction of the anomalous values in the primary and secondary sort keys.\nClipping\nA clipping step was used to remove the anomalous high-amplitude sample values from the input data and replace them with a threshold sample value. This was made in a way to guarantee that the largest positive and the largest negative sample amplitudes are acceptable.\nHatton et al. (1986) refer that very high amplitude reflections are generally clipped at a specific excursion of between 2 and 4 times the trace spacing, to prevent nearby adjacent traces being obscured or confused.\nOne simple and practical way to determine the range of the \u201cnormal\u201d data amplitudes is moving the mouse over the seismic data and seeing which the common values are. The SPW software also allows visualizing a histogram that shows the amplitude distribution of the selected data traces (Figure IV.10).\nThe clipping tool was selected in the Amplitude Adjustment processing category, and the chosen input values were -20000 and +20000 (Figure IV.11).\nFigure IV.10 - Data amplitude histogram analysis display.\nFigure IV.11 - Clipping tool in the flow 01 - Import.\n35\nTrace Sample Math\nFigure IV.12 - Before and after the application of Trace Sample Math processing tool in the trace amplitude values.\nThe seismic profiles were \u201ccut\u201d onboard (specifically, the water column), due to limited storage available. This shift has to be corrected here in order to avoid future problems in the processing flows. This requires two processing tools: Resample Seismic and Apply Static Shifts.\nResample Seismic\nThe current trace length for the seismic profile is 4000 ms, but the true trace length is 7000 ms. To move the seismic data 3000 ms down it is necessary to create the missing time first. The Resample Seismic tool allows changing the start time and trace length of the data (Figure IV.13). Also, in this step, the sample interval can be changed, but that is not required in this specific case. This processing tool is also found in the Editing processing category.\nFigure IV.13 - The amplitude correction flow and the Resample Seismic dialog.\nApply Static Shifts\nThis processing step allowed applying a 3000 ms bulk shift to all the seismic data traces (Figure IV.14), so that the sea-bottom and subsurface reflections are now at the correct time.\nFigure IV.14 - Application of a 3000 ms bulk shift to all the seismic data traces.\n37\nIV.3.2 Quality control and frequency filtering tests\nThe quality control step is extremely important in the so-called \u201cpre-processing\u201d phase. It is also common to repeat this step at strategic points in the processing sequence, as the data response to many processes is not always uniform and predictable (Hatton et al., 1986).\nAll seismic traces from each channel were displayed as shot gathers (Figure\nIV.15). The main problems detected are consistently bad or reversed polarity channels, some coherent noise, potential multiples and interference over narrow frequency bands (Hatton et al., 1986).\nAfter a cautious observation of all traces it was noted that the first nine traces showed some low frequency noise in the firsts channels, principally. In the last traces, a coherent noise also appears, but it should be highly reduced through stacking. Low frequency noise from channels 26 and 47 affect all traces (Figure IV.15).\nAfter observation trace by trace, the seismic file was displayed in the form of channel gathers, to better analyze the noisy channels previously identified. The first four channels show a little more noise than the other ones, except for the most critical: channels 26 and 47 (Figure IV.16)\nFigure IV.16 - Channel gathers from channels 26 and 47.\n39\nFrequency filtering tests\nTo maintain the frequency content of the seismic signal within a certain range of interest (to preserve the information desirable), frequency filters are applied to the seismic data. Band-pass filtering is commonly used, because a seismic trace typically contains both low-frequency noise, such as ground roll or other, and some high-frequency ambient noise (Yilmaz, 2001a).\nA spectral analysis of the seismic data and noise is fundamental to find out which frequencies should be eliminated. First the noise frequency content was analyzed (Figure IV.17), and it was concluded that most of the noise frequency was lower than 50 Hz.\nThen, using the same procedure, the data frequency was analyzed (Figure V.18). The amplitude spectrum generated shows that the most frequency content is below 350 Hz, although some information still remains up to 700 Hz.\nFigure IV.18 - Spectrum analysis of the data frequency content (on top, amplitude spectrum; in normal scale; below, amplitude spectrum in a logarithmic scale - dB).\nFour low frequency filtering tests were made. In the first one was applied a 70 Hz Butterworth filter; these limits were chosen because they were used in onboard processing (Figure IV.19). The other high-cut chosen frequencies were 40 Hz (Figure IV.20), 50 Hz (Figure IV.21) and 60 Hz (Figure IV.22). Due to the high level of noise in channel 26 (and 47 too), this channel was chosen to perform a comparison between these four low-cut frequencies (Figure IV.23). The final decision was to cut all the low frequencies up to 50 Hz.\n41\nAlso, three high-frequencies tests were made (Figure IV.24). In the onboard processing, the high-cut frequency used was 425 Hz; therefore so one of the tests used this value. High-cut frequencies as 300 Hz and 700 Hz were also tested. To preserve the maximum frequency content, considering that no significant high frequency noise was observed in the data, a high cut of 700 Hz was chosen.\nFigure IV.19 - First filtering test using 70 Hz as high-cut frequency.\nFigure IV.20 - Second filtering test using 40 Hz as high-cut frequency.\nFigure IV.21 - Third filtering test using 50 Hz as high-cut frequency.\nFigure IV.22 - Fourth filtering test using 60 Hz as high-cut frequency.\n43\nFigure IV.23 - Comparison of the testing four low-cut frequencies on channel 26.\nFigure IV.24 - Comparison of the testing three high-cut frequencies on channel 26 with no high frequency filtering.\nIV.3.3 Flow 02 - Geometry\nThe processing flow 02 - Geometry (Figure IV.25) is composed by the following processes: Simple Marine Geometry, Butterworth Filtering and Spherical Divergence.\nFigure IV.25 - Flow 02 - Geometry.\nSimple Marine Geometry\nThe correct geometry assignment is crucial for a precise and accurate seismic processing. After this processing phase, the correct location of each shot, seismic receiver and CMP location are written into the headers of the seismic file. A mistake in this step has a large impact on subsequent processing stages (e.g. migration).\n45\nSPW works with its own integer units and not with real geometry parameters (metric system). Consequently, the first step of geometry assignment phase is to select a value which will correspond to an integer SPW unit; normally it should be a submultiple of both the seismic shooting interval and the channel spacing. The shooting interval from CIRCEE-HR dataset is approximately 16 meters (shot cadence about 6s), according to the report, and the channel spacing is 6.25 meters. The least common multiple in this case should be 3.125m (1 SPW = 3.125m), because it is half of channel spacing and a fifth of shooting interval (it will be considered 15.625m).\nSPW software has a specific processing tool for marine acquisition (Figure IV.27). It is easy to fill (as long as everything is clearly defined before), and prevents possible user calculations errors.\nFigure IV.26 - Scheme of multichannel seismic acquisition geometry, adopted on the CIRCEE-HR scientific cruise, for line 14, in metric and SPW units. As 26 SPW units are equal to 81.25m the 1.75m difference will be added to the source coordinates or subtracted to the receivers\u2019 coordinates, to keep the shot-receiver offsets connect.\nFigure IV.27 - Simple Marine Geometry processing card.\nButterworth Filtering\nFollowing the results from the filtering tests described above, a 50-700 Hz Butterworth filter was applied, in order to preserve as much high frequency information as possible (Figure IV.28), considering that no high frequency noise was observed.\nFigure IV.28 - Butterworth Filtering process card.\n47\nSpherical Divergence\nThere are many factors which affect the amplitude of the seismic signal as it propagates through the Earth. One of them is called spherical divergence. In a homogeneous medium, the wavefront from a point on the reflector will be spherical. As the wavefront expands, the energy of the disturbance is spread over a larger and larger area, so that the energy density of the seismic wave decreases with propagation distance (McQuillin etal., 1984; Figure IV.29).\nFigure IV.29 - Schematic representation of spherical divergence showing the spreading of the initial acoustic energy over an ever increasing wavefront surface with distance (http://theflavorful.com/classes/cooking-with-sound/sound-reference/).\nThe spherical divergence correction process increases the gain of the data using a spatially averaged velocity function with the time, compensating in this way the loss of amplitude of deeper reflections due to geometrical spreading over a larger area. This processing tool is found in the Amplitude Adjustment processing category; default parameters were applied (Figure IV.30).\nSometimes a gain function is also used to compensate for attenuation losses (increasing the amplitude content of the data in the deeper section). This processing step was not performed because the processing tool Apply Gain was not correctly working in this SPW version.\nFigure IV.30 - Spherical Divergence Correction process card.\n\nProfile 14 after flow 01\nProfile 14 after flow 02\nFigure IV.31 - Comparison between the output single channel seismic profiles after flow 01 -Import (above) and flow 02 - Geometry (bellow).\n49\nIV.3.4 Velocity Analysis\nAfter the geometry definition, the filtering and the amplitude correction steps, a velocity analysis is performed, which will be used for the stack and migration algorithms.\nTo perform this processing step the Velocity Analysis Builder was opened on [Analysis] [Velocity Analysis]. The input file was the seismic file with the geometry assignment. The analysis outputs chosen were Velocity semblance, CMP gather and velocity picks. The parametrization used can be seen on Figure IV.32.\nDue to the short streamer (only 450 m of active sections) used in this multichannel seismic reflection survey, it was impossible to make a good velocity analysis (see Figure IV.33). That is why in the following steps (Normal moveout, stacking and migration) a constant velocity of 1540 m/s was used.\nFigure IV.32 - Velocity Analysis Builder.\nFigure IV.33 - Velocity Analysis display. In the left: the CMP. In the right: the velocity semblance, showing that the short offsets do not allow an adequate velocity analysis.\nIV.3.5 Flow 03 - NMO_Stack\nThe processing flow 03 - NMO_Stack (Figure IV.34) is composed by the following processes: Apply Normal Moveout and CMP Stack.\nFigure IV.34 - On the left: flow 03 - NMO_Stack. On the right: CMP sorting of the input seismic file.\n51\nBefore applying the NMO (normal moveout), the sort keys of the input file 1_Geometry must be: CMP line (primary key), CMP location (secondary key) and Offset (tertiary key; Figure IV.34). See Section III.2.3 for more detailed information on CMP sorting.\nApply Normal Moveout\nThis step corrects the time shift for each trace in a gather due to the offsets between receivers and sources on the arrival time corresponding to a same reflection point. Since the velocity analysis could not give good results due to the short offsets, as previously explained, a constant velocity of 1540 m/s was used for this correction. Several constant velocities were tested to improve the stack, but the final choice was the same adopted in onboard processing. The remaining parameters of the process card were filled with the default parameters, which are adequate in this case (Figure IV.35).\nFigure IV.35 - Apply Normal Moveout process card.\nCMP Stack\nCommon-midpoint stacking is the most important data-processing step in improving the imaging quality of the data. The traces within a common-midpoint gather are summed, along horizontal NMO-corrected seismic events, to yield a single stacked trace. The stacking of a seismic section severely increases the overall signal-to-noise ratio and attenuates most multiples and other coherent noise events that do not follow a hyperbolic path in the CMPs (Figure IV.36). The stack seismic section can be viewed in Figure IV.37.\nCMP gather after NMO\nSorted CMP gather\tcorrections\tStacked Trace\nFigure IV.37 - Seismic profile 14 after normal move-out correction and stacking.\n53\nIV.3.6 Flow 04A - StoltMig1540\nThe processing flow 04A - StoltMig1500 (Figure IV.38) consists of the Stolt (FK) Migration process (using a constant velocity of 1540 m/s).\nFigure IV.38 - Flow 04A - StoltMig1500.\nSeismic Migration\nSeismic migration is the procedure by which an image of the correctly positioned subsurface reflecting interfaces is obtained from a seismic time section (Figure IV.39). Correctly implemented, it is a transform from the unmigrated time domain to the migrated time or depth domain. The most important parameter in the migration process is to estimate reliable migration velocity model at all subsurface positions (Yilmaz, 2001a). When a seismic section is migrated, two undesirable effects may happen as a result of inadequate use of higher or lower seismic velocities: overmigration and undermigration, respectively.\nMigrated section\nDepth structure\nTime section\n--- ----- ---- -----\u2022\nThere are many types of migration algorithms available: (a) based on differential methods, (b) implemented in the FK domain (e.g. Stolt method), and (c) based on integral methods (e.g. Kirchhoff method). The migration algorithms can be applied before or after stack. Regardless of the migration algorithm used, the interpretability of a migrated section is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio, on the velocities used in migration, and on the quality of the stacked section (when dealing with post-stack data; Yilmaz, 2001a).\nThe Stolt (FK) migration method was the first to be applied to the seismic line due to its faster algorithm for post-stack time migration. No velocity cards were linked. Instead, a 1540 m/s constant velocity was used, as it in the onboard processing (Figure IV.40). The final section can be seen in Figure IV.41.\nFigure IV.40 - Stolt (FK) Migration process card.\n55\nFigure IV.41 - Seismic line after Stolt (FK) migration.\nIV.3.7 Flow 05A - PreStackKirchhoffMig1540\nThe pre-stack migration has the same principles as a post-stack migration but handles correctly the reflectors inclination from the beginning, instead of trying to correct for it after stack. Here, the migration algorithm is applied in each CMP gather and not in just each CMP location. It is therefore more time and computational consumer processing, but it allows, in most of the cases, better results, particularly for the deeper positions of the seismic sections in cases of very complex geology.\nKirchhoff\u2019s Prestack Time Migration was tested on one of the lines, to see if any improvement could be obtained (Figure IV.42). However, as expected, due to the lack of a good velocity model from the velocity analysis step (short length streamer to the massive water column and complex geology), no improvement could be obtained, as no reliable velocities could be assigned. The final section pre-stack migrated section can be seen in Figure IV.43.\nFigure IV.42 - Flow 05A - PreStackKirchhoffMig1500.\n57\nIV.4 Comparison with onboard processing\nThe re-processing clearly improved the imaging of deeper horizons, which was one of the main aims in this work, since the upper part of the seismic sections was already well imaged. This was achieved largely because of the larger filter used (preserved frequencies between 50 Hz to 700 Hz. A comparison between on board processing profile and re-processing profile after migration can be viewed in Figure IV.44.\nFigure IV.45 - On-board processing profile 14 after Stolt migration (detailed seismic section from Figure IV.43a).\nFigure IV.46 - Re-processing profile 14 after Stolt migration (detailed seismic section from Figure IV.43b).\n\nChapter V. Migrating Sediment Waves\nWynn et al. (2000c) defined sediment waves as a large-scale, undulating, depositional bedforms generated beneath a current flowing at, or close to, the seafloor.\nSediment waves occur in a variety of environments and water depths, and a display a wide range of morphologies, dimensions and sediment types (Wynn et al., 2000c). Deep-water sediment waves have been studied by marine geologists for almost 60 years; however, their formation mechanisms still are not fully understood. Despite this, in general, it is accepted that it always involves flows at or close to the sea floor (Wynn and Stow, 2002).\nV.1 Global significance\nSediment waves have been observed in a wide variety of sedimentary and tectonic setting all over the world. In this chapter we present several examples such sedimentary structures. Damuth (1979), Reeder et al. (2010), Gong et al. (2011) and Li et al. (2013) reported the existence of several fields of sediment waves in the South China Sea, whose formation mechanisms and characteristics are clearly distinct. Previously, Karl et al. (1986) speculated that internal wave currents were the responsible formation mechanism for the Navarinsky Canyon sand waves. Recently, Droghei et al. (2016) proposed internal solitary waves as the formation mechanism of the sediment waves in the Messina Strait. Migeon et al. (2000) reported and compared the evolution of two fields of sediment waves (superficial and fossil) on the Var deep-sea fan, Ligurian Sea.\nSouth China Sea\nDamuth (1979) discovered a large field of migrating sediment waves on the gently dipping seaward wall of the Manila Trench, northern South China Basin (Figure\nV.1). Their wavelengths range from 200 m to 5 km, and their amplitudes range from 5 to 50 m. The internal structure of the waves suggests upslope migration. The regional setting and sediments characteristics of these sediment waves,\n61\nFigure V.1 - In the left, location of the sediment waves on seaward wall of Manila Trench at northern end of South China Basin. In the right, two echograms (3.5 kHz) across migrating sediment waves (location shown by the red square in the map). Modified from Damuth (1979).\nGong et al. (2011) identified two fields of sediment waves on the South China Sea Slope off southwestern Taiwan (Figure V.2 and V.3). Field 1 is located in the lower slope and the sediment waves there are overall oriented perpendicular to the direction of the down-slope gravity flow and canyon axis. Asymmetrical morphologies (the wavelengths range from 0.5 to 4 km, and the wave heights range between 7 and 117 m) and internal discontinuous seismic reflections suggest that the sediment waves underwent significant up-slope migration. The development of the sediment waves in field 1 in interpreted as the result of the interactions between down-slope turbidity currents and along-slope bottom (contour) currents. Field 2 is located near the continental rise and, in contrast, the sediment waves show more symmetrical morphologies (the wavelengths range from 1.5 to 5.4 km and the wave heights can be up to 110 m) and continuous reflections (that can be traced from one wave to another) suggesting a predominant vertical aggradation rather than up-slope migration. The development of the sediment waves in this field is mainly controlled by the WSW flowing bottom (contour) currents induced by the intrusion of the Northern Pacific Deep Water into the South China Sea.\nFigure V.2 - Bathymetric and location map of the two fields of sediment waves on the South China Sea Slope off southwestern Taiwan (Gong et al., 2011).

See profile location in Figure V.2.\nLi et al. (2013) studied the Plio-Quaternary unidirectionally migrating channels and contourites (which include sediment waves) on the northern slope of the South\n63\nChina Sea, at water depths from 200 to 3000 m (Figure V.4). Here, the sediment waves' characteristics are upslope migration and an asymmetric geometry whose wavelengths and wave heights vary between 0.34 to 3.12 km and 14.7 to 125.7 m, respectively. Some of them developed on the drifts (Figure V.5).\nFigure V.4 - Location of the seismic section shown in Figure V.5 in the northern slope of the South China Sea (modified from Li et al., 2013).\n\na)\nSeamount\nGiant elongated drifts\nGiant elongated drifts\nb)\nFigure V.5 - Sediment waves from deep water settings in the South China Sea (see\nmap\nin Figure V.4). Top profile (a): asymmetric waveforms, upslope migration, parallel to subparallel, moderate to low amplitude seismic reflection. Bottom profile (b): Some sediment waves develop with drifts (Li et al., 2013).\nReeder et al. (2010) propose a distinctive formation mechanism for sand waves on the upper continental slope of the northern South China Sea, between 160 and 600 m water depth: internal solitary waves. These internal solitary waves, also called solitons, are generate from tidal forcing on the Luzon Ridge on the east side of the South China Sea and propagate west across the deep basin with amplitudes regularly exceeding 100 m (Figure V.6), dissipating extremely large amounts of energy via turbulent interaction with the continental slope, suspending and redistributing the bottom sediment (approximate 60 episodic, extremely energetic, large amplitude events each lunar cycle). The sand dunes are composed of fine to medium sand, with amplitudes exceeding 16 m and wavelengths exceeding 350 m and they exhibit an intermittent, irregular distribution over the slope (Figures V.7 and V.8).\n65\nFigure V.7 - The water column structure of the Internal Solitary Waves (ISW) in the South China Sea. The ISW is propagating along the thermocline in the form of a single, large depression wave of 125 m amplitude. See location of the acoustic profile and the sediment grab samples (g1, g2, g3 and g4) in Figure V.6 (Reeder et al., 2010).\nFigure V.8 - Sub-bottom profile acquired by a 3.5 kHz chirp sonar system showing part of the sand dunes observed (Reeder et al., 2010). See location in Figure V.7.\nreasons: (1) the energy of the internal waves could be amplified at the head of Navarinsky Canyon; (2) upslope boundary-layer intensification of internal-wave currents might be sufficient to move the sediments, and (3) the wavelengths of higher-frequency internal waves closely match the spacing of the sand waves. The best-developed sand waves' wavelengths and amplitudes range from 600 to 650 m and 5 to 15 m, respectively, at 150 to 225 m of water depth. The wavelength of the one-hour-period internal-wave ranges from 350 to 650 m in those water depths, suggesting a kinematic relationship between high-frequency internal waves and the sand waves.\nFigure V.9 - Location of the profile shown in Figure V.10 (red line), in the Navarinsky sand-wave field, Bering Sea (Karl et al., 1986).\nFigure V.10 - Mini-sparker profile showing examples f sand waves in the head of Navarinsky\nCanyon. Note the upslope asymmetry (Karl et al., 1986).\n67\nMessina Strait, Mediterranean Sea\nMore recently, Droghei et al. (2016) proposed that internal solitary waves (ISWs) induced by tides can produce an effective, unidirectional boundary \u201ccurrent\u201d that forms asymmetric sand waves. They tested this hypothesis by examining a sandwave field off the north entrance of the Messina Strait (Figure V.11), between 200 and 300 m water depth. The sand waves here have wavelengths between 60 and 120 m, and wave heights of 1.5 to 5 m; wave dimensions tend to increase northward. After combining field observations and numerical modelling, they present three key features to show ISWs can be the responsible mechanism for the sediment wave formation: (1) they produce fluid velocities capable of mobilizing bottom sediments; (2) the predicted refraction pattern resulting from the interaction of ISWs with bottom topography matches the observed deflection of the sand waves; and (3) predicted migration rates of sand waves match empirical estimates.\nFigure V.11 - The Messina Strait and the observed sand-wave field. (a) Bathymetric map of the Messina Strait; (b) 3D zoom of the sand-wave field; (c) Bathymetric section of the sand-wave crests. Sand waves show variable cross-sections, from asymmetric (longer stoss side followed by shorter and steeper lee side) to more symmetric moving northward (Droghei et al., 2016).\nVar Sedimentary Ridge, Ligurian Sea\nMigeon et al. (2000) studied the evolution of two fields of sediment waves (a surficial and a subsurface field) on the Var deep-sea fan (Ligurian Sea; see Figure\nV.12), at depths between 2000 and 2600 m.\nFigure V.12 - Location of the Var turbidite system within the Ligurian Basin. Red line: seismic profile of Figure V.13.\nIn the surficial field, sediment waves amplitudes range from less than 5 m to up as much as 60 m, with an average of about 20 m. Their wavelengths range from 600 to 7000 m, with an average of about 2200 m. The wave crests are subparallel to the Middle Valley and to the crest of the ridge. In the subsurface fossil wave field, amplitudes range from less than 10 to 50 m, with an average of about 25 m, and wavelengths range from 900 to 4400 m, with an average of about 2200 (this values only approximate the true wavelengths and amplitudes at the time of their deposition, because of the effects of sediment compaction and possible erosion of the crests). These sediment waves are constructed by turbidity currents that spillover and spread sediments across the Ridge. The authors pointed out that spillover energy, pre-existing morphology and sediment supply appear to be important control factors of the sediment wave distribution and evolution. Also, salt diapirs\n69\nmay influence the formation of the sediment waves locally by deforming the upper sediment deposits and creating a pre-existing wavy topography. The development of sediment waves appears to be the fundamental element controlling the manner in which levees within an asymmetrical turbidite system may prograde, aggrade and migrate (Figure V.13).\nSSE\tNNW\n0--------------2 km\t3\n&lt;ft\n\"Inverse\" asymmetrical sediment wave\tg\nft\nsubsurface field\nFigure V.13 - Sediment waves field in the middle part of the Var Sedimentary Ridge (Migeon et al., 2000). See profile location in Figure V.12.\nV.2 Formation mechanisms and classification\nFormation mechanisms\nIn summary, four main formation mechanisms have been proposed for sediment wave formation: (A) bottom currents; (B) turbidity currents; (C) internal waves; and (D) internal solitary waves.\n(A) Bottom currents and (B) turbidite currents are the best studied mechanisms of sediment waves' formation (Figure V.14), in response to the 90's boom in climate change studies and due to the increasing demand for data on turbidity systems from the hydrocarbon exploration and production industry (Wynn &amp; Stow, 2002). Bottom currents include also contourite currents and thermohaline currents. These types of sediment waves have been grouped on the basis of grain size into fine-and coarse-grained sediment waves by Wynn &amp; Stow (2002) (see Table V.1). Fine-grained sediment waves are commonly found in areas where turbidity currents flow unconfined, as on the back slopes of channel levees (e.g. Var Sedimentary Ridge; Figure V.9; Migeon et al., 2000; Cartigny et al., 2011). The fine-grained sediment waves consist of mud to fine sand, with the coarser grain sizes deposited on the stoss side (Ercilla et al., 2002). The coarse-grained sediment waves are often located in the proximal part of the submarine fan systems, such as in canyons, channels, and channel-lobe transitions (e.g. Monterey Canyon; Xu et al., 2008; Wynn &amp; Stow, 2002).\n(C) Another proposed formation mechanism is internal waves (Karl et al., 1986; Flood, 1988; Flood &amp; Giosan, 2002; Xu et al., 2008; Reeder et al., 2011; Droghei et al., 2016). Ocean internal waves are waves in the interior of the ocean which are generated when the interface between layers of different water densities (caused by a water temperature or salinity difference) is disturbed, usually caused by tidal flow over shallow bathymetry (iwww.link.springer.com). Flood (1988) presented the lee-wave model (Figure V.15), where a weakly stratified bottom flow is perturbed by the sediment topography leading to a change in the velocity structure of the flow. He showed that the near-bottom flow field associated with the lee waves creates a cross-wave asymmetry in bottom current velocity.

(b) Schematic diagram summarizing the major depositional processes in different region of the referred area. The upper slope is characterized by gravity flow erosion and sediment bypass. Sediments shed from the upper slope are transported basinward into the lower slope where the interactions of down-slope turbidity currents and along-slope bottom (contour) currents induced by the intrusion of the Northern Pacific Deep Water into the referred area (INPDW) result in the development of sediment wave field 1. Further basinward into the continental rise where sediment wave field 2 is develop, turbidity currents are diluted and along-slope bottom currents are the dominant processes.

These waves are generated by tidally forced currents flowing over topographical features in a stratified ocean (Reeder etal., 2011).\nIn recent years, some large erosional sediment waves also have been interpreted as cyclic steps, Cartigny et al. (2011) made a general comparison between sediment waves and cyclic steps, which are a series of slowly upslope migrating bedforms, where each downward step (the lee side of the bedform) is manifested by a steeply dropping flow passing through a hydraulic jump before re-accelerating on the flat stoss side (Figure V.16; comparison in Figure V.17).\nIt is likely that all these processes have a role in sediment wave formation, depending on the specific depositional, hydrodynamic and tectonic setting.\nClassification of sediment waves\n73\nFigure V.16 - Schematic drawing of a train of downslope asymmetrical cyclic steps, beneath a turbidity current (Cartigny et al., 2011).\nUnderlying Deposits\nI7; \"7\nFigure V.17 - Comparison of properties of three possible interpretations of sediment waves: dunes, antidunes and cyclic steps (Cartigny et al., 2011).

Migrating sediment waves in the Ionian Sea\nIn this chapter we describe the three major fields of migrating sediment waves that can be observed in the Ionian Sea, on the basis of the available data for this study. We analyze each area in turn and show the evidence available from high resolution seismic profiles and from multibeam bathymetry.\nIn order to be able to correlate the observations between the different seismic profiles, some of the major unconformities (delimiting seismic sequences) and well defined major turbidites (Homogenite/Augias Turbidite, HAT - 365 AD; Polonia et al., 2013; Deep Transparent Layer, DTL - 14kyr b.p.; Polonia et al., 2013; and Thick Transparent Layers, TTL - 650kyr\u00b1100kyr; Hieke et al., 2000) have been identified on the few available seismic profiles and correlate using the Kingdom Suite Software.\nIn the absence of borehole constrained age interpretations of seismic profiles in the study area, and in order to assign tentative dates to the various episodes of sediment wave formation, the top of the Messinian (5.3 Myr) was interpreted on all the relevant seismic profiles. If a constant sedimentation rate is assumed until present, a value of 10cm/1000yr is obtained; However, according to Cita, Ryan &amp; Kidd (1979) a value of 14cm/1000yr has been determined, for the Pleistocene, and an average value of about 6cm/1000yr for the Pliocene, obtained at DSDP Site 374 in the Ionian Sea, close to the study area (Cita, Ryan and Kidd, 1978). An age of 2.58Myr was assumed for the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (International Chronostratigraphic Chart, v2016/12).\nAfter tentative dates have been assigned to the relevant reflectors, we show how the sediment wave pattern has changed through time in the three main fields, if the sediment waves are migrating or if only vertical aggradation is taking place, and propose a tentative age for end of the sediment wave formation in Line14.\n77\nVI.1 Major Fields of Sediment Waves in the Ionian Sea\nGutscher et al. (2015) and San Pedro et al. (2016) identified for the first time the presence of active sediment waves in the study area based on bathymetric surveys (see alternating green and blue lines in Figure II.7; see purple lines delimited by dashed rectangles in Figure VI.1). However, to our knowledge, fossil seismic wave fields have never been identified before in this area. Here we report the first identification of several fossil migrating sediment wave fields detected in the Ionian Sea and also images of the active fields at depth, based on high resolution seismic profiles acquired during the CIRCEE Cruise (Gutscher et al., 2013; 2015).\nAbyssal plain\nCalabrial\nLarge basins\nCanyons and channels axis\nSediment waves\nAnticlinal ridges\nPerched basins\nKCIR-08\n0 15 30\t60\t90\t120\n\u25a0 \u25a0\tKm\nCoordinate system: WGS84 Mercator 33N\nFigure VI.1 - Morpho-bathymetric interpretation of the Calabrian accretionary wedge (modified from San Pedro et al., 2016).

An unpublished high-resolution bathymetric image for area A was also kindly made available for this study by M.-A. Gutscher, in which it is possible to observe a presently-active sediment wave field and correlate it with the seismic profiles that cross that area (Figure V.3).\nA detailed observation of the seismic profiles has allowed the identification of three sediment wave fields in the study area (Figure VI.2). These include both presently-active sediment waves (observed in fields A and C) and fossil sediment waves (observed in all three fields, A, B and C).\n79\nFigure VI.3 - Detailed unpublished bathymetric image around sediment wave field A on top of the bathymetric survey depicted in Figure VI.2 on the sediment wave fields A and B. The color traces indicates the segments of the seismic profiles where the sediment waves were observed. Yellow lines: present-active sediment waves. Red lines: fossil sediment waves. Light yellow dashed line: deformation front of the Calabrian accretionary wedge. The high-resolution bathymetry map shows clearly a present-active sediment field in Area A (courtesy from Marc-Andre Gutscher; MS in prep. Gutscher et al.).\nFigures VI.4 to VI.12 show seismic images of the sediment wave fields as observed in Areas A, B and C.\nSediment waves in Field A\nField A is the southernmost field of sediment waves in the study area (Figure VI.3). It is located closer to the Ionian Abyssal Plain, between the 3500 and 4000 m isobaths. The crests of the presently-active migrating sediment waves are perceptible from the high-resolution map (Figure VI.3 and VI.19). They seem to be roughly perpendicular / oblique to the main turbidite channel (see yellow line in Figure VI.1) and deformation front of the wedge. These recent bedforms can be seen in two of the seismic profiles that cross this field, lines 10 and 11-01 (Figures\nVI.5 and VI.6, respectively), which are perpendicular to the deformation front of the\nCalabrian accretionary wedge (yellow lines in Figure VI.3). In the all four seismic profiles that cross this field it is possible to identify fossil migrating sediment waves (Figures VI.4 to VI.7).\nProfile 14\nNW\tSE\nOffset:\t54000 55000 56000 57000 58000 59000 60000 61000 62000 63000 64000 65000 66000 67000 68000 69000 70000 71000 72000 73000 740069\n2.100\n2.200\n2.300\n2.400\n2.500\n2.600\nFigure VI.4 - Location of fossil sediment waves (red rectangle) of field A in seismic profile 14.

There are no bathymetric evidences (CIRCCE data) of active sediment waves in this area, as shown by the seismic profiles that cross this field (Figure VI.8 to VI.11), although they may exist further south. Only fossil sediment waves are visible in the seismic profiles. The perpendicular lines to the deformation front show that these ancient bedforms are buried in the zone turbidite channel that surrounds the deformation front of the accretionary wedge (Figures VI.1, VI.9 and VI.10; San Pedro et al., 2016). In Section IV.2, the fossil sediment waves from profile 14 will be analyzed in detail to date the several episodes of sediment wave formation and abandonment.\nSediment waves in field C\nField C is only represented on seismic profile 01 (Figure VI.12), which was the northernmost acquired seismic line in the CIRCEE-HR survey. This line begins on the midslope offshore Augusta (see location in Figure VI.2).

The seismic attribute Envelope was used to better identify the major turbidity episodes and to improve the lateral correlation.\nThen, the correlation of those major seismic horizons was extended into the zones in which the sediment waves were observed. Due to the complex geology of the region and to the fact that we only had access to the CIRCEE-HR 2D multichannel seismic survey, the horizons correlation was difficult and sometimes impossible. Despite this, the boundary horizons of the several formation episodes, mainly of the fossil sediment waves, could be correlated with the same confidence.\nFigure VI.13 - Location map of the CIRCEE seismic profiles and Figures VI.14, VI.15 and VI.16.\nFigure VI.14 - Multichannel seismic profile 12.

Assuming seismic velocities of 2500 m/s, the thickness of the TTL could reach up to 83 m Ionian Abyssal Plain (0.066s TWT; profile 1601). This turbidity deposit is a good marker to delimit the top of fossil sediment waves observed in seismic profiles that cross fields A and B, allowing an age to be assigned to the time of abandonment of sediment wave formation in same areas.\nProfile 13\nW\tE\n0\t5000\t10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 40000 45000 50000 55000 60000 65000 70000 75000 80000 85000 90000 95000 100MD14\nProfile 12\nOffset:\t0\nNW\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\nIn the absence of borehole constrained age interpretations of seismic profiles in the study area, and in order to assign tentative dates to the various episodes of sediment wave formation (Figure V.18), the top of the Messinian (5.3 Myr; International Chronostratigraphic Chart, v2016/12) was interpreted on the relevant seismic profiles. If a constant sedimentation rate is assumed until present (assuming an average seismic velocity about 2700 m/s), a value of \u00ab 10cm/1000yr is obtained; this value is consistent with a value of 14cm/1000yr for the Pleistocene, and an average value of about 6cm/1000yr for the Pliocene, obtained at DSDP Site 374 in the Ionian Sea, close to the study area (Cita, Ryan and Kidd, 1978). An age of 2.58Myr was assumed for the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (International Chronostratigraphic Chart, v2016/12). A depth conversion based on the average sedimentation rates of Cita, Ryan and Kidd (1978) was used for the post-Messinian (Figure VI.18).\n91\nHolocene\n&amp;.40O-\nTop of the Messinian evaporites\nProfile 14\nTWT(S)\noffset 0\t1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 11000 12000 13000 14000 15000 16000\n. 111 i,L n 111111111 u 1.1 n 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 > 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 u 11 u 11111111 u 111111111111111 n 11111111 u 11111\nNW\n2,58\n3\n2.200\nFigure VI.18 - Tentative of dating major seismic horizons in seismic profile 14 (fossil sediment waves from field B) based only on the age of Miocene/Pliocene boundary (5.3 Myr; International Chronostratigraphic Chart, v2016/12) assigned to the reflector that marks the top of Messinian, and sedimentation rates for the Pliocene and Pleistocene, obtained at DSDP Site 374 in the Ionian Sea (Cita, Ryan and Kidd, 1978). This allows to define the reflector that marks the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, at about 2.58 Myr (International Chronostratigraphic Chart, v2016/12). Major seismic horizons were identified: top of the Messinian (red); Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary and base of the fossil sediment wave field (blue); an evident change of the sediment wave pattern (dark blue at about 2.2s TWT); base of the TTL and top of the fossil sediment wave field (dark green). Other indicate horizons presented identify several sediment wave formation events. Light red areas mean a gap in the sediment wave formation. Black arrows show the migration direction of the sediment waves. See location of the seismic profile in Figure VI.3).\nVI.3 Sediment wave evolution in Fields A, B and C\nIn this section we analyze the evolution of the sediment wave fields in the study area. It is important to note that wavelength and wave height values presented here are not real but apparent.\nSediment Wave Field A\nIn this area, the presently-active sediment wave crests seem to be perpendicular/oblique (Figure VI.19) to the present-day turbidity channel that surrounds the deformation front of the Calabrian accretionary wedge (see yellow line in Figure VI.1). Seismic profiles perpendicular to the deformation front show evidence of some upper-slope migration (Figure VI.20). Northward, fossil sediment waves are buried bellow the location of the present-day channel. The wavelength (\u00bb762m) and wave height (\u00bb50m) values of the fossil sediment waves (Profile 1101; Figure VI.20), assuming v=2000m/s, are larger than the presently-active sediment waves values (\u00bb455m and =30m, respectively), showing differences in the hydrodynamics or at the sediment grain size in the region.\nFigure VI.19 - Migrating sediment wave field A. The colored traces (yellow and red) indicate the segments of the seismic profiles where the sediment waves were observed (yellow lines: presently-active sediment waves; red lines: fossil sediment waves). Light yellow dashed line: deformation front of the Calabrian accretionary wedge. The high-resolution bathymetry map shows clearly a presently-active sediment field (courtesy from Marc-Andre Gutscher; MS in prep. Gutscher et al.). Light pink lines: main directions of the crests of presently-active sediment waves.\n93\nUpslope migration\nOffset:\nVertical -aggradation I\n2.300-\nFigure VI.20 - Presently-active and fossil sediment waves in profile 11-01. See location of the profile in Figure VI.3. Blue line: Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary and base of the fossil sediment wave field. Black arrows show the migration direction of the sediment waves.\n\nThe asymmetry of the sediment waves allows defining an apparent current direction (Figure VI.20). The sediment waves in this section are essentially migrating in an apparent SW direction but change into essentially aggradational close to the Medina Seamounts.\nSediment Waves Field B\nProfile 14 reveals the best image of fossil sediment waves of field B and will be used to explain the several formation episodes. Previously, in Figure VI.18, we propose tentative ages for the main reflectors based on available data. According to those ages, the first evidences of sediment wave formation were in the Early Pleistocene and their formation appears to have occurred approximately at the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, a time of major climatic and oceanographic changes in the Northern hemisphere (Head, Pillans and Farquhar, 2008). Between 2.58 and 2 Myr, part of the section shows the formation of longer wavelength (~1450m) upslope migrating sediment waves, essentially in the WNW portion of the line. There seems to be a progression of sediment wave formation to the\nWNW during this period (compare blue, green and yellow shaded areas in Figure VI.18. At about 2.2 Myr almost no sediment waves were formed in this area (red shaded areas in Figure VI.18). At about 2.2 Myr major episodes of sediment wave formation episodes were triggered. These sediment waves have shorter wavelengths of \u00ab905m and larger wave heights of \u00ab22.5 m (assuming v=2500 m/s) than the older ones (\u00ab1450m and \u00ab12.5m, respectively). These more recent sediment waves clearly show migration upslope, except for the northerwest section where only aggradation occurs. Around 700kyr the formation of sediment waves began to cease in the eastern portion of the seismic section (Figure VI.18). The horizon that represents the base of TTL represents the end of the activity of this fossil sediment field, about 400kyr ago. Just to the E of the sediment wave field, a deep submarine turbidite(?) channel is observed which would lie north of the present turbidite channel axis interpreted by San Pedro et al., 2016; Figure VI.1). As will be discussed in Section VI.4, this points to a palaeochannel turbidite channel spillover as a possible formation mechanism.\nSediment Wave Field C\nThe sediment waves of field C present an asymmetric geometry, well-laminated and gently dipping internal reflectors and an up-slope migration pattern (Figure VI.21). The wavelengths are about 565 m and the wave heights vary between 21 and 28 m (assuming an average seismic velocities of 1500 and 2000 m/s for the superficial and fossil, respectively).\nIt was not possible in this work to variably correlate the seismic horizons to the northern profile in order to date the start of the fossil sediment wave formation in this area.\n95\nFigure VI.21 - Sediment waves from seismic profile 01. See line location in Figure VI.2. The direction of the current is down-slope (dark blue arrow). Black arrows show the migration direction of the sediment waves (up-slope). Red dashed lines are two major normal faults.\nVI.4 Possible formation models\nSediment Wave Field C\nAs concerns the northern field (field C; profile 01; Figures VI.2 and VI.22A), the observed migrating sediment waves might be explained by gravity flows (turbidity currents), since its location is in the midslope Augusta, next to the Malta escarpment, where several canyons exist and where sediments flow down-slope to the channels in the base of the escarpment. Turbidite channel spillovers may explain their formation. However, internal solitary waves formed in the Messina Straight (Figure VI.22B), may provide an alternative formation mechanism in field C, as these can easily explain the observed patterns. Recently, Droghei et al. (2016) reported this formation mechanism to explain the formation of a migrating sediment wave field off Messina Strait (see Section V.1 and Figure V.11).\nMessina Strait\nEastern lobe\nK-G-14\nWestern lobe\nZ Calabria\n(T Calabrian Arc\nInternal Waves in the Strait of Messina\n21 October 2006 16:48 GMT\n15'25-E\t15\u201830-E\t15 35'E\t15'40'E\t15\u201945'E\n____540000\t55\u00b0\u00b022_________560000\t570000\n.

[B] SAR image shown a clear internal solitary waves train signature in the Messina Strait, propagating to southward (Casagrande et al., 2009).\nSediment Wave Fields A and B\nAs concerns the two southern fields, although we cannot rule out the possible role of internal waves, there are no reported observations of their presence in this area. Also in field B, the formation of sediment waves appears to have stopped sometime between 700kyr and 400kyr. For this area, we propose that the fossil sediment waves (Line 14; Figure VI.18) have been formed by turbidite channel spillover (see in particular Figure VI.19), producing sediment waves approximately perpendicular to the main turbidite channel (Figure VI.3); we cannot, nevertheless rule out the possibility of interaction of the main turbidite channel, that approximately follows the deformation front, with bottom currents, but we could not also find any report of their existence in this area.\n97\nChapter VII. Conclusions and Future Work\nMain conclusions\nIn general, the main objectives of this thesis were essentially achieved. The CIRCEE-HR high resolution multichannel seismic lines were reprocessed and a slight improvement of the imaging of the deeper part of the seismic sections was obtained. The lack of a very significant improvement is due to the short streamer length that did not allow a reliable velocity model to be obtained. This is also why we could not get any better results with pre-stack time migration.\n3\tmain fields of sediment waves, both fossil and active were identified on the set of high resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles available for this study. These were investigated and several generations of sediment waves with different wavelengths and amplitudes were identified.\nIn the absence of borehole constrained age interpretations of seismic profiles in the study area, and in order to assign tentative dates to the various episodes of sediment wave formation, an overall interpretation of the main seismic reflectors was carried out and correlated between the various seismic profiles. In particular, top of the Messinian was interpreted on the relevant seismic profiles. Using average sedimentation rate values of 14cm/1000yr for the Pleistocene, and of about 6cm/1000yr for the Pliocene, based on DSDP Site 374 data, it was possible to tentatively date the main reflectors and episodes of sediment wave generation.\nTwo main models of formation were proposed. For the northernmost Sediment Wave Field C, although a possible origin related to turbidite channel spillover cannot be ruled out, it appears that solitary internal waves generated at the Messina Strait may be the more likely responsible mechanism. This is supported by recent studies and by SAR images. As concerns the two southern fields, however, although the possible role of internal waves or the interaction of turbidite channels with bottom currents cannot be ruled out, there are no reported\n99\nobservations of their presence of neither of them in this area. Therefore, we propose that the fossil sediment waves have been formed by turbidite channel spillover, producing sediment waves approximately perpendicular or oblique to the main turbidite channel. The turbidite channel that now approximately follows the deformation front appears to have been before located further north, this may be an indication that the migration to the south of the accretionary wedge associated with the subduction rollback has stopped the formation of the sediment waves, which are at present formed much further south. If this is correct, a detailed interpretation, constrained by reliable ages, of the various generations of sediment waves in this area may help to constrain the dynamics of the accretionary wedge migration episodes. In field B, the formation of the sediment waves appears to have completely stopped sometime at about 400kyr, although this process started locally at about 700mMyr. We interpret this as linked to the migration to the south of the turbidite channel that approximately follows the edge of the deformation front, caused by the subduction rollback.\nFuture Work\nThe main conclusions of this thesis are naturally limited by the time available and a more detailed study of the various sediment wave episodes revealed on these seismic lines, now that a time framework has been obtained for this purpose, may still allow a more refined model that may help to better understand of the interaction between tectonics, associated with the subduction rollback and the migration to the south of the accretionary wedge and deformation front, turbidite episodes and sedimentation, and bottom currents and internal solitary waves. As such, for future work, we suggest to:\n1.\tRefine the age model obtained for the main seismic reflectors based on other well data, if available;\n2.\tMap in detail the presently active sediment wave fields, using for that purpose the new multibeam data recently acquired in this region;\n3.\tCompile any other seismic lines that may exist in this area, reprocess them if necessary and use them to constrain the 3D geometry of the fossil sediment wave fields;\n4.\tAcquire a new 2D high resolution seismic dataset, with a similar source to the one used in CIRCEE-HR to get a good penetration, along detailed grids over the fossil sediment wave fields and with exploratory lines to define the total extension of the sediment wave fields;\n5.\tCompile all the available information on deep contour currents and on internal waves and solitons that may exist in this area, by contacting naval hydrographic offices and by analyzing SAR images in the vicinity of the presently active sediment wave fields;\n6.\tPerform numerical and analog models in cooperation with physical oceanographers to test and better understand the various possible formation models for sediment wave migration.\n101\nBibliography\nCartigny, M., Postma, G., Berg, J., &amp; Mastbergen, D.
