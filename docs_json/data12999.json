T. MACHADO1, CARLOS R. TREIN2 \n\n \nABSTRACT: The interaction between the soil and tillage tool can be examined using different \nparameters for the soil and the tool. Among the soil parameters are the shear stress, cohesion, \ninternal friction angle of the soil and the pre-compression stress. The tool parameters are mainly the \ntool geometry and depth of operation. Regarding to the soils of Rio Grande do Sul there are hardly \nany studies and evaluations of the parameters that have importance in the use of mathematical \nmodels to predict tensile loads. The objective was to obtain parameters related to the soils of Rio \nGrande do Sul, which are used in soil-tool analysis, more specifically on mathematical models that \nallow the calculation of tractive effort for symmetric and narrow tools. Two of the main soils of Rio  \nGrande do Sul, an Albaqualf and a Paleudult were studied. Equations that relate the cohesion, \ninternal friction angle of the soil, adhesion, soil-tool friction angle and pre-compression stress as a \nfunction of water content in the soil were obtained, leading to important information for use of \nmathematical models for tractive effort calculation. \n \nKEYWORDS: Soil cohesion, soil-tool adhesion, pre-compression stress. \n \n \n\nCARACTERIZA\u00c7\u00c3O DOS PAR\u00c2METROS DE SOLOS DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL \nUTILIZADOS NA MODELAGEM DA PREDI\u00c7\u00c3O DO ESFOR\u00c7O DE TRA\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n \nRESUMO: A intera\u00e7\u00e3o que ocorre entre o solo e a ferramenta de preparo pode ser analisada por \nmeio de diferentes par\u00e2metros.

A better understanding of \nsoil-tool interface can be obtained by correlating the rheological behavior of soil with its dynamic \nfeatures, and the disruption of the soil will depend on the geometry of the tool, operating speed and \nsoil physical properties (KARMAKAR &amp; KUSHWAHA, 2006). \n\n\n\nAnt\u00f4nio L. T. Machado &amp; Carlos R. Trein \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.4, p.709-717, jul./ago. 2013 \n\n710 \n\nThe tractive effort of a tillage tool varies widely depending on different conditions, which \nrelate to the tool and soil condition (MANUWA, 2009; CAMACHO-TAMOYO &amp; RODR\u00cdGUEZ, \n2007). \n\nAccording to GODWIN &amp; DOGHERTY (2007), the knowledge of the forces that act on the \ntools while working, in conjunction with the soil tool interaction mechanisms are important for the \ndesign of more effective elements of soil mobilization. The type and degree of soil mobilization are \nthe main factors in the selection of tillage equipment. \n\nInteraction between soil and tool can be analyzed by means of different soil parameters and \nthe tool itself. Among the soil parameters are the shear stress, cohesion, the internal friction angle of \nthe soil and the pre-compression stress. The tool parameters consider the rake angle, the depth and \nthe working speed. Among those relating to soil-interaction tool, it can be relate to the adhesion and \nthe angle of friction between soil and the tool material. Such parameters are used in the \ndevelopment of theories and mathematical models that try to quantify and predict the tractive effort \nproduced by tools. For a better understanding of the relationship between soil-preparation tools, \nthere is a need to know what it is and which factors influence soil shear strength, which is directly \nrelated to the actual contact between the soil particles, directly influencing its resistance to      \ndeformation. A direct shear test can allow the evaluation of the resistance of a soil sample to shear \nand, consequently, its internal friction angle and cohesion, important parameters in mathematical \nmodels for prediction of stress caused by tillage tools. The study of soil compressibility comes to be \nof fundamental importance, since it makes it possible to obtain their pre-compression stress, which \nallows identifying the maximum loading that the soil can withstand without permanent deformation. \n\nLAMAND\u00c9 &amp; SCHJ\u00d8NNING (2011a), report that stress transmission in soil is a crucial \ningredient of the cause-and-effect chain, and may lead to a plastic or elastic deformation of the soil. \nIn their studies a maximum value of soil strain was caused by 200kPa tire tractors at a 0.3 m depth. \nThe reduction of the capacity of soil to support loads after recent mobilization optimizes stress \ndistribution on the interface-tire-ground, not affecting the spread of tensions to deeper layers. \n\nThe increase in loads of wheeled machines used in agriculture has increased the magnitude of \ntensions caused in the soil, in ever increasing depth (LAMAND\u00c9 &amp; SCHJ\u00d8NNING, 2011b). The \nmechanical property used in the prediction of the load-bearing capacity of the soil, to predict the \neffects of traffic on soil structure, is the pre-compression stress, which varies depending on the \nwater content of the soil (SILVA et al., 2007 and CAVALIERE et al., 2008). \n\nThe most used method of obtaining pre-compression stress was developed by Casagrande in \n1936; being a graphical method it is prone to imperfections (R\u00dcCKNAGEL et al., 2010). In his \nstudy these authors concluded that the method presented an error of 15%, which is tolerable for \nmost applications. For the same condition of soil, the factor that governs the amount of deformation \nthat may occur is the water content. Getting data from soil pre-compression stress in different water \nlevels, it is important to define the situation of use of agricultural machinery in order to not cause \npressures in excess of its ability to support, since the transmission of stresses in soil is extremely \nsensitive to changes in water content (DIAS J\u00daNIOR &amp; PIERCE, 1996; MACHADO &amp; TREIN, \n2000; LAMAND\u00c9 &amp; SCHJ\u00d8NNING, 2011 c). \n\nAmong other parameters that are important for soil characterization and the study of soil-\npreparation tool are soil texture, porosity, density, density of solids, plasticity index and contraction \nthreshold, which has been widely studied. The aim of this study was to obtain the values of the \ninternal friction angle, cohesion, adhesion, pre-compression stress, soil-tool friction angle and \nadhesion angle, for both the Albaqualf and Paleudult, thereby allowing stress calculation in \ndifferent soil water content to be used in mathematical models that allow the calculation of tractive \neffort of symmetric and narrow tools. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nCharacterization of soil parameters of two soils of Rio Grande do Sul in modeling the prediction of tractive effort \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.4, p.709-717, jul./ago. 2013 \n\n711 \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \nThe study was developed in two different soils: Albaqualf and Paleudult. These two soils \n\ncharacterize some of the most frequent soils of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. \n\nThe Albaqualf is at the experimental field of the agricultural machinery Sector of DER-\nFAEM, located in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, between 31\u00b052'00\" South and 52\u00b0 21' 24\"West: it is \ncurrently called \u2018Planossolo Hidrom\u00f3rfico\u2019. The area was under natural pasture and had not been \ntilled for ten years. \n\nThe Paleudult soil is at the Experimental Station of the Faculty of Agronomy of UFRGS, in \nEldorado do Sul, RS, between 30\u00b005'27\" South and 51\u00b0 40' 18\" West, currently classified as Red \ntypical Distrophic Argisols. The area was covered with pasture of clover and grasses. \n\nFor cohesion and the internal friction angle of the soil, undisturbed soil samples were taken at \n0.20 m depth, in rings 0.063m internal diameter and 0.025m high. Fifteen samples per plot were \ntaken. A set of five soil cores, after saturation, was subjected to a certain level of suction, in \nRichards' Pressure Chamber, to suction levels of 100; 330 and 15000kPa, characterizing soil in \nthree situations of water content, namely: \n\na-Between the upper and lower limit of plasticity; \n\nb- Intermediary between the contraction limit and the lower limit of plasticity; \n\nc- Lower than the limit of soil contraction.  \n\nIn this way it was possible to identify each soil as moist, crumbly and dry.  Pre-compression \nstress was obtained following the recommendations set out in MB-336 (ABNT, 1990), through the \nuse of a brand name Testop oedometer, belonging to the Soils Department of the Faculty of \nAgronomy of UFRGS. \n\nSoil cores were confined laterally by a ring of steel and top and bottom by porous plates. The \nvertical load was applied by a rigid distribution device with uniform pressure. Loading stresses \nwere applied in small increments, and the vertical deformation was measured with the aid of a \ndeflectometer. \n\nEach sample was subjected to seven load increments, with the values of 12.5; 25; 50; 100; \n200; 400 and 800kPa. The weights were changed manually, every five minutes, and readings were \ntaken at intervals of 30 \", 1 ', 2 ', 4 ' and 5 '. The five-minute interval was defined previously, and \nmore than 90% of the sample consolidation occurs in this time interval. With these data, porosity \nindex was plotted against the logarithm of vertical effective stress for each of the soils, in every \ncondition of water content. From these curves and through the process of Pacheco Silva (ABNT, \n1990) the pre-compression stress was attained. \n\nIn each soil and water content for the various normal stresses was obtained a value for the \nmaximum shear strain. Soil cores were taken to direct shear equipment, Soiltest, model D-350A-4 \nat the Soils Department of the Faculty of Agronomy of UFRGS. Each set of five samples underwent \nnormal stresses of 8.67; 17.34; 34.69; 69.37 and 138,74kPa, and, in each loading situation, a ten-\nminute time interval for densification was allowed. Graphics correlating the normal stress with \nmaximum shear strain were built, with the internal friction angle and cohesion of soil, in every \nsituation of water content in the soil, on a total of three values for each situation. Later the average \nfor every soil and water content was estimated.  \n\nThe internal friction angle and the soil-material adhesion were obtained through the collection \nof soil cores to a depth of 0.20 m, in rings, whose dimensions are the same as those used for the \ndirect shear test, previously described. The samples were in number of fifteen per plot. In the same \nway as in direct soil shear test, each set of five samples, after saturation, was subjected to the same \nsuction levels described above characterizing the soil in their plastic, crumbly and dry consistency. \nSoil samples were subjected to the same direct shear equipment. Soil cores were placed at the top \n\n\n\nAnt\u00f4nio L. T. Machado &amp; Carlos R. Trein \n\nEng.

The soil-material adhesion index and soil-material friction angle \nwere attained. Other soil physical parameters; water content, texture, plasticity index, soil density, \ndensity of solids, total porosity, macro and micro porosity of soil were obtained from nine soil cores \ntaken at  the depth of 0.20 m, at each site. The procedures for its determination were those \nrecommended as standard in the area of soil physics.  \n\n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nSoil physical parameters of the soils are in Table1 \n \n\nTABLE 1. Physical parameters for characterization of the studied soils (average values of nine \nrepetitions).  \n\nParameter Albaqualf Paleudult \n                                                                             Texture (kg.kg-1) \n\nSand 0.620 0.672 \n\nSilt 0.263 0.150 \n\nClay 0.117 0.178 \n\n                                                                              Density (kg.m-3) \n\nSoil density 1513 1570 \n\nParticle density 2695 2636 \n\n   Atterberg limits (kg.kg-1) \n\nUpper plasticity limit 0.217 0.226 \n\nLower plasticity limit 0.181 0.139 \n\nPlasticity index 0.036 0.087 \n\n                                        Porosity (m3. m-3) \n\nMacroporosity 0.086 0.149 \n\nMicroporosity 0.353 0.268 \n\nTotal porosity 0.439 0.418 \n\n \nObserving the texture data and using the diagram of textural classes for particle size \n\nclassification, both soils can be classified as sandy loam soils. However it turns out that the amount \nof clay present in the Paleudult is higher that of Albaqualf. \n\nBoth, soil density and particle density are very close for the two soils. \n\nRegarding Atterberg limits, both soils have similar values for the upper plasticity Limit (UPL) \nbut, in relation to the lower plasticity  limit (LPL) there is a difference, allowing a plasticity index \nmore than twice for the Paleudult, when compared to that found for the Albaqualf. Therefore, there \nis a lower water holding capacity by Paleudult, compared to the Albaqualf, which has the highest \nwater-holding capacity. Also, through observation of the Atterberg limits, the amount of water \nnecessary to soils to reach the plastic state or to become friable or even completely saturated. \n\nBy testing it was found that, for the studied soils, when applying a suction of 100kPa, the \nremaining amount of water would correspond to the water content of the soil in the plastic phase, \nbecause the value obtained was below the upper plasticity limit (UPL) and above the lower \n\n\n\nCharacterization of soil parameters of two soils of Rio Grande do Sul in modeling the prediction of tractive effort \n\nEng.

When soils were subjected to a suction of 330kPa, more water was taken \nfrom the soil samples allowing soils to attain friability, as the amount of water remaining in the \nsample was below the LPL. When the samples were subjected to a suction of 15000kPa soils \nreached the dry state. \n\nMicro porosity is higher than macro porosity in both soils, and the Paleudult macroporosity \nand microporosity are lower when compared to Albaqualf. It is also noted that, although the macro \nand microporosity values are different, the total porosity values are quite close. \n\nThe use of charts that correlate the maximum shear stress (?) versus normal stress (?), in three \nsoil moisture content, allowed getting a linear equation which enabled the calculation of the internal \nfriction angle (?) and cohesion (C) of the both soils. \n\nThe values of the internal friction angle and cohesion of soil to the Albaqualf are presented in \ntable 2. \n\n \nTABLE 2.

By the middle of table 2 also shows that cohesion falls \nsharply when the water content is 0.14 to 0.19kg.kg-1, which characterizes the value soil in its \nplastic state. It is evident therefore that the excess water on the soil has a role of lubrication. \n\nInternal friction angle (?) shows little variation (around 3o), when the soil has water content of \n0.19 (maximum) and 0.08 kg.kg-1 (minimum), although it is possible to observe that it has the \ntendency to decrease as the water content increases. \n\nThrough the equations laid down, calculating the cohesion and internal friction angle of \nAlbaqualf, with different moisture is possible, and are regarded as important tools in the study of \nthe models that calculate the tractive effort provided by a tillage tool. \n\n The values of the internal friction angle and soil cohesion of Paleudult are in Table3 \n \n\nTABLE 3.

Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.4, p.709-717, jul./ago. 2013 \n\n714 \n\nThe data regression analysis resulted in the equations that relate the cohesion and the internal \nfriction angle of Paleudult, depending on its water content: \n\nC = 12752 ?2 \u2013 3722.9? + 293.15; r2 = 0.9261                                                                        (3) \n\n? = -3661.5 ?2 + 610.64 ? + 15.707; r2 = 0.9997                                                                     (4) \n \nBy analyzing table 3 it turns out that cohesion increases sharply with decrease of water \n\ncontent of the soil, going so far as to be almost three times higher when this soil goes from  a water \ncontent of 0.13kg.kg-1to 0.08kg.kg-1. \n\nIt is also possible to check what occurs in Paleudult regarding the behavior of its internal \nfriction angle. It turns out, comparing the results with those attained with Albaqualf, which, \nalthough showing a lower variation of water content, changing this factor was greater in Paleudults. \nHowever, the two soils showed the same trend, i.e., the increase of the internal friction angle with \nthe decrease in soil water content. \n\nWith the previously established equation, it becomes possible to calculate the internal friction \nangle and cohesion to the Paleudults, in different situations of water content in the soil. As it \nhappens with Albaqualf, this comes to be an important tool for the study of mathematical models to \ncalculate the tractive effort necessary to pull tillage equipment. \n\nThe analysis of Tables 2 and 3 shows that for both soils there is  a trend to  cohesion increase \nas the water content in the soil decreases, which had been expected, since the lower the water \ncontent in the soil, the stronger is the attraction between soil particles. With respect to the  internal \nfriction angle of soil, it turns out, that it increases for both soils  as the water content in the soil is \nreduced, even though the values obtained being slightly different (and higher) for the Red Argisols. \n\nThe comments above are in line with those of KARMAKAR &amp; KUSHWAHA, (2006), \nMANUWA, (2009) and CAMACHO-&amp; TAMOYO RODR\u00cdGUEZ, (2007), which correlate the \ncontent of water as the most important factor in soil-machine relationship. \n\nS\u00c1NCHEZ-GIR\u00d3N (1996), indicates that the solid and liquid phases of the soil condition its \nmechanical behavior, and water filling up the pores (to  saturation) reduce the contact forces \nbetween the particles, reducing shear resistance, by reducing its internal friction. \n\nThrough data that correlate the maximum soil shear strain -material (?a) and the normal stress \n(?), in three levels of water, it becomes possible to obtain the line equation which allows the \ncalculation of soil friction angle-material (?) and soil-material adhesion (Ca) of Albaqualf and \nPaleudult, in different conditions of soil water content. \n\nThe soil friction angle values-soil adhesion and material-material, for the Albaqualf are \npresented in table 4, while those concerning Paleudult, can be found in table 5. \n\n \nTABLE 4.

The drier the soil, the lower the trend in adhering to the tool, because \nwith the reduction of water in the soil adhesion ceases to exist and only friction between the tool \nmaterial and the soil are acting. \n\nAlso the angle of soil-tool friction, presents similar behavior for both soils, i.e. both tend to \ndecrease as the water content increases, again featuring the water as a lubricant when exceeding \ncertain values. It turns out that, within the same range of water content present in the soil of 0.13 to \n0.10kg.kg-1, the variation of soil friction-material of the tool turns out to be small, although they \nshow a little more pronounced for the Planossolo. Also the soil friction angle-material, presents \nsimilar behavior for the two soils, i.e. both tend to decrease as the increase of water content in the \nsoil, again featuring the character water lubricant when exceeding certain values. It turns out that, \nwithin the same range of water content present in the soil of 0.13 to 0.10kg.kg-1, the variation of soil \nfriction-material of the tool turns out to be small, although a little more pronounced for Albaqualf. \n\nSoil-material adhesion falls sharply when soil water goes from 0.11kg.kg-1to 0.09kg.kg-1 \n(table 5). This probably is due to the change of the state of soil moisture, i.e. in the range of \n0.11kg.kg-1 the soil is still friable. When the water level is around 0.09kg.kg-1, the soil is very close \nto dry. Therefore, the observation of a sharp reduction in soil-material adhesion is in line with those \nof Ashburner and Sims (1984). \n\nPre-compression stress values for the Albaqualf related to soil water content are set out in \nTable 6. \n\n \nTABLE 6. Values of moisture (kg.kg-1), initial void ratio (ei) and pre-compression stress (Spc), for \n\nAlbaqualf (mean of three repetitions).  \n\nWater content (kg.kg-1) ei Spc (kPa) \n0.19 0.37 78 \n0.14 0.35 96 \n0.12 0.81 103 \n0.09 0.43 110 \n\n \nThrough these results the tendency of Albaqualf to increase its resistance to the normal stress \n\napplied to the soil is observed, as there is decrease in water content. The equation of the line that \ndefines the behavior of pre-compression stress as a function of water in the Albaqualf is shown \nbelow: \n\n\n\nAnt\u00f4nio L. T. Machado &amp; Carlos R.

Values of the levels of moisture (kg.kg-1), initial void ratio (ei) and pre-compression \nstress (Spc), for Paleudult (average of three repetitions).  \n\nWater content (kg.kg-1) ei Spc (kPa) \n0.17 0.50 52 \n0.12 0.49 100 \n0.09 0.77 107 \n0.08 0.52 108 \n\n \nThe behavior of pre-compression stress as a function of the water content in the soil for \n\npaleudult is defined by the equation: \n\nSpc = -8416.2?2 + 1489.6? + 42.061, r2 = 0.9993                                                                   (10) \n \nThe establishment of the equations that define the behavior of the pre-compression stress as a \n\nfunction of water in soil is important when predicting the behavior of both soils, with regards to the \nresistance that they offer to the pressure exerted by agricultural machinery. \n\nBy analyzing Tables 6 and 7 it may be noted that when both soils are virtually dry, with water \ncontent around 0.09kg.kg-1, pre-compression stress reaches its highest level, being the value \nobtained for the Albaqualf a little higher than that recorded for the Paleudult. DIAS J\u00daNIOR &amp; \nPIERCE (1996), MACHADO &amp; TREIN (2000) and SILVA et al. (2007) also showed that the soil \nhas more resistance when it is drier. \n\nWhen the water in the soil reaches 0.12kg.kg-1 threshold, which defines its friable state, pre-\ncompression stresses for both soils are close, But Albaqualf\u2019s is slightly higher than Paleudult\u2019s. \nWhen both soils are with the water content which gives them plastic consistency, its behavior \nbecomes different. Albaqualf has higher pre-compression stress values, meaning that, under these \nconditions, this soil resists higher loads than Paleudults before deforming irreversibly. \n\nPaleudults having less resistance to external loading can be explained due to its higher clay \ncontent. \n\n \nCONCLUSIONS \n\nIt was possible to set up equations that define the relationship between the values of the \ninternal friction angle, cohesion, adhesion, pre-compression stress, soil-tool adhesion and friction \nangle and the water content in the soil, for Albaqualf and Paleudult. \n\n For both soils there was a tendency of internal friction angle, cohesion and pre-compression \nstress increase while water in soil decreases.  \n\nSoil tool cohesion and friction angle tended to decrease with the increase of water content in \nthe soil, for both soils. \n\nWhen friable, both soils show similar values of pre-compression stress. \n\nIn the range of soil water content that define plastic soil, Paleudults show the lower resistance \nto load appliance. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nCharacterization of soil parameters of two soils of Rio Grande do Sul in modeling the prediction of tractive effort \n\nEng.
