The large and mesoscale circulation and the barotropic tidal propagation are investigated with a nested configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System - ROMS. Regional Baia de Camamu (CMB) dynamics is investigated based on the analysis of an original field data covering dry and rainy conditions. The EBM is an oligotrophic and bathymetrically complex zone, on the NW South Atlantic (8\u00b0S to 20\u00b0 S), whose dynamics is influenced by the divergence of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). The oceanic circulation reflects the seasonal and spatial relations between the southward Brazil Current and the northward North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC), in connection to the SEC dynamics. While on the top layer (0-100 m) the circulation presents a pronounced spatial variability, on subsurface waters (100-500 m) the NBUC connects the EBM continuously. A first order description of eddies activities and its interaction with the near-shelf dynamics were considered. Eddy kinetic energy (EKE) calculated from AVISO sea level anomaly and transport estimates provides a validation of the mesoscale model results. CMB is a shallow bay system that sustains artisanal fisheries and extensive mangrove, but lies over a sedimentary basin with large oil and gas reserves, being under environmental pressure. We summarize the regional CMB physical setting and investigate the inner dynamics, its variability and major driving factors along Sept. (2004) and July (2005) field survey. Finally, tidal signals are added to the numerical model system with the objective of evaluating the model response, by using a simple configuration (that applies constant bottom stress and homogeneous hydrographic conditions), and to investigate the nature of the barotropic tidal propagation along different spatial scales over the EBM and towards CMB. The model tidal response is evaluated with historical short period tidal gauge data for the EBM and recent CMB pressure sensor data.\nContents\nAcknowledgements\tv\nResumo\tvii\nAbstract\tix\nContents\txi\nList of Figures\txiv\nList of Tables\txix\n1\tIntrodution\t1\n1.1\tGeographical outline: Bahia and\tthe Eastern Brazilian Margin....... 2\n1.2\tMarine system characterization and stresses........................ 3\n1.3\tObjectives of this work............................................ 6\n1.4\tScience results and divulgation.................................... 9\n2\tMean circulation, seasonal cycle and eddy interactions in the Eastern\nBrazilian Margin, a nested ROMS model\t11\n2.1\tIntroduction...................................................... 11\n2.2\tThe modeling design and the two\tnested grids...................... 15\n2.3\tThe model validation approach\t.................................... 18\n2.3.1\tEddy kinetic energy......................................... 18\n2.3.2\tSea surface height anomalies................................ 22\n2.3.3\tThe large scale flow pattern and transport validation....... 23\n2.4\tThe seasonal cycle .................................................. 29\n2.5\tSpatial variability and dynamical zones.............................. 35\n2.6\tEddy interactions on the Eastern Brazilian Margin ................... 39\n2.6.1\tSnapshot over a cyclonic eddy................................. 44\n2.6.2\tSnapshot over an anti-cyclonic eddy........................... 46\n2.7\tConcluding remarks................................................... 48\n3\tPhysical setting, hydrography and circulation of Baia de Camamu.\nField results covering dry and rainy conditions.\t51\n3.1\tIntroduction......................................................... 51\n3.2\tRegional settings of Baia de Camamu.................................. 54\n3.2.1\tPhysiography.................................................. 54\n3.2.2\tPluviometry................................................... 56\n3.2.3\tFluviometry................................................... 58\n3.2.4\tRegional wind field........................................... 60\n3.3\tSampling strategy and methods ....................................... 61\n3.4\tSea level variability and the local wind............................. 64\n3.5\tAn evaluation of the dry and rainy conditions concurrent the sampling\nsurveys. ............................................................ 69\n3.6\tHydrography and flow patterns at Baia de Camamu main channels. . .\t71\n3.6.1\tSeptember 2004 -

The Eastern Brazilian Margin is a low productive and bathymetrically complex zone of the Western South Atlantic whose dynamics is influenced by the large scale South Equatorial Current divergence. The main goal of this work is to combine numerical and data analysis efforts to investigate the multi-scale dynamics on the ocean, shelf and estuarine compartments, exploring the connections between scales, whenever possible.\nEach work is presented on a self-contained chapter, containing its own introduction, objectives and concluding remarks. The presenting order was established in terms of spatial scales, from the large to the regional scale. A topic regarding the modelling of barotropic tidal currents is presented at the end, since it integrates the different spatial scales involved. In order to keep this dissertation as close as possible to the scientific article format but still attaining to the classical academic dissertation form, this document presents a common abstract, a general introduction and a closing final remarks and future work perspectives chapter. A common bibliography with reference to the citing pages is also included. Since the Eastern Brazilian Margin is a lesser investigated zone of the Western South Atlantic, cross-referencing among the chapters was unavoidable.\n1.1\tGeographical outline: Bahia and the Eastern\nBrazilian Margin\nIn this work a multi-level grid and framework was adopted to investigate the ocean, shelf and estuarine processes of the Eastern Brazilian Margin. The investigated zone, geographically limited from 8\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S is politically bordered by the Brazilian states of Pernambuco (partially), Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and Espirito Santo (partially). The Bahia state however, whose coastline extends from 11\u00b027/S to 18\u00b020'S, along 1183 km, covers most of the domain, being the geographical focus of this study. Figure 1.1 presents the geographical framework considered. Inner diagram in grid L0, depicts the estate of Bahia, within Brazil and South America.\nSalvador is the political capital of the state of Bahia and its major city. There are about 2,998,056 inhabitants in the city of Salvador and 3,475,000 on the metropolitan zone, making it the third most populous metropolitan zone in Brazil. The population density was 4,093 inhabitants per square kilometer [IBGE, 2008a]. Salvador was founded in 1549 being the first colonial capital of Brazil (until 1763) and was an active slave port on the trade connection between Brazil and West Africa for over three centuries [Alencastro, 2000; Verger, 2002]. Nowadays, most of the population is mixed descended from slaves and Iberian settlers (53.8%) or negroes (28.5%) [IBGE, 2008b]. The Black African were mainly Bantu speakers (> 2/3) from Angola and Congo and, secondarily Yoruba speakers from Nigeria, Ghana, Togo and Benin [Vianna Filho, 2008].\n1.2\tMarine system characterization and stresses\nThe Eastern Brazilian Margin has a mesotidal regime, presents a generally narrow continental shelf and receives moderate to low river discharges along over 30 fluvial courses, the largest of which being the Sao Francisco (10\u00b030/S) and the Jequitinhonha (15\u00b052/S) rivers [Knoppers et al., 1999]. A transition from siliciclastic dominant sediments on the coastline to pure carbonates towards the middle and outer shelves, characterizes the continental shelf of tropical Brazil [Leao, 2002].\nThe Eastern Brazilian Margin is considered a Class III, low productivity (&lt;150gC/m2 /yr) ecosystem based on the SeaWiFS global primary productivity [U. S. Department of Commerce, 2004]. Fishing is practiced on a small scale being mostly artisanal, catches tends to be low. Herring, snapper, mackerel, and albacore are some of the commercial species harvested. Snapper, triggerfish, swimcrabs and Atlantic seabobs are dominant in the landings of Abrolhos Bank and tunas species are caught offshore around seamounts and banks [Ekau and Knoppers, 2003]. Nevertheless the Eastern Brazilian Margin encompasses some important coastal and estuarine systems, such as Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos, Ba\u00eda de Camamu and the Abrolhos Bank, where the productivity is certainly higher, although data is scant.\nBa\u00eda de Todos os Santos is the second largest embayment along the Brazilian coast presenting a area of 1223km2 and an average depth of 9.8 m [Lessa et al., 2001; Cirano and Lessa, 2007], being located adjacent to Salvador. The inner bay circulation is mostly tidally driven and does not vary significantly throughout the year [Cirano et al.,\n2007]. The bay watershed is impacted by the pressure of Salvador intensive industrial, commercial and fishing activity [Le\u00e3o, 2002]. Ba\u00eda de Camamu is a shallow system which occupies a flooding area of approximately 384 km2 being an important fishing, mining and touristic site located at the central Bahia estate (14\u00b0S; 39\u00b0W). Contrasting with Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos, on Ba\u00eda de Camamu the watershed is surrounded by small cities and extensive mangrove vegetation [Oliveira, 2000]. Ba\u00eda de Camamu also\npresents numerous small islands and several small-scale fisheries communities whose population is engaged on artisanal fishing [Souza and Petrere-Jr, 2008] and subsistence agriculture practices. Prior to this work there were no study regarding the seasonality of Ba\u00eda de Camamu dynamics.\nFinally, on the Southern Bahia coastal zone, from 16\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S, the topography is marked by two major banks, the Royal Charlotte bank and the Abrolhos bank. Between those, an extended and irregular shelf projects towards the sea (The shelf width, with a mean extension around 35-45 km, widens to 110 km near Royal Charlotte and to 190 km at Abrolhos Bank). Within the Abrolhos Bank, from 10 to 65 km from the coast, a reef complex that occupies an area of approximately 6,000 km2 holds the southernmost and most extensive coral reef environment in the South Atlantic Ocean, with 16 species of stony coral recorded [Le\u00e3o, 2002]. This is a spot of great biological importance, colonized by many archaic, endemic coral species, resultant from the isolation of a late tertiary community. [Le\u00e3o, 2002]. On its Southern flanks, subsurface nutrient enrichment due to upwelling of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water has been reported [Summerhayes et al., 1976; Ekau, 1999; Gaeta et al., 1999]. The physical nature of this upwelling is not yet fully understood being attributed to instabilities of the Brazil Current over the irregular topography [Ekau, 1999; Gaeta et al., 1999] while Pereira et al. [2005] points out the effect of internal tides and steep topography, enhancing the upwelling in the zone.\nThere is evidence of pressure over the coral reefs, and coral bleaching has been reported in northern Bahia and in Abrolhos reefs but the levels of mortality still remain low [Ekau and Knoppers, 2003]. The coast is very vulnerable to tanker movement and oil spills occurred in 1974 (Esso Garden State), 1975 (Yarik Ibn Ziyad), 1978 (Brazilian Marina), 1985 (Marina) and 1986 (Brotas) among the major occurrences. In each case the spill involved more than 10,000 barrels of oil [Ekau and Knoppers, 2003]. Floating paraffin compounds, from the 2001 (Pietro B\u00e1rbaro) spill and drift bottles released on a marine educational action were used to chart the shelf circulation at the time [Rezende,\n2001].\nFurthermore, in the past few years there has been increasing attention on giant oil reserves struck along the Brazilian margin. Recently, eighteen areas on the Eastern Brazilian shelf were offered for concession on international auctions, including six shallow areas, a few kilometers from Baia de Camamu. Commercial gas exploration on the nearby shelf have started on 2007 [ANP, 2009]. The local residents fears of episodic or systematic contamination of Baia de Camamu by such activities. Simulations performed by Amorim [2005] predict that accidental oil spill from such fields, in the worst scenario, could reach the bay within one day.\nDespite extending over a zone with great social, economic and environmental relevance, the Eastern Brazilian Margin dynamics and connectivity is virtually unknown. The large scale and mesoscale dynamic in the Eastern Brazilian Margin is deeply influenced by the South Equatorial Current Divergence and its seasonal variability. The South Equatorial Current is a broad, westward flowing current that connects the tropical and the subtropical Atlantic Ocean through the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. As its southern branch approaches the Eastern Brazilian Margin, carrying subtropical Benguela Current water towards the shelf, it bifurcates into the Northward flowing North Brazil Current system and the Southward flowing Brazil Current system [Stramma et al., 1990; Stramma and Schott, 1999]. According to Rodrigues et al. [2007], the bifurcation latitude varies poleward with depth, from 10\u00b0S to 14\u00b0 S near the surface to 27\u00b0S at the 1000 m depth. After they are formed, these major current system (Brazil and North Brazil) dominates the upper ocean circulation along the Brazilian Margin. The Eastern Brazilian margin is located on the divergence zone, being subject to numerous variabilities on the large and mesoscale dynamics. Nowadays, a wide uncertainty regarding this region dynamics remains and very few published science are available to guide.\n1.3\tObjectives of this work.\nIn this work a multi-level grid and framework was adopted to investigate the large, mesoscale and regional marine processes on the Eastern Brazilian Margin. In Chapter 2 our main goal is to establish a view of the seasonal mesoscale circulation on the Eastern Brazilian Margin, retaining on the solution the connections and forcing from the large-scale (ie: the South Equatorial Current divergence and variabilities) and emphasizing the temporal and spatial connectivity along the Margin. This is obtained with the implementation of a nested configuration into the community based Regional Ocean Modeling System - ROMS. [Haidvogel et al., 2000; Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005]. Following, we make an attempt to establish a first order description of the mesoscale activities revealed on the model simulation. Some possible interactions between the meanders, the shelf and the near-coastal processes are speculated as those may have sound environmental relevance on the oligotrophic Eastern Brazilian Margin. The geographical framework comprises grids L0 and L1 in Figure 1.1.\nRegional Baea de Camamu processes are investigated based on the analysis of an relatively extensive field data set (Chapter 3). Part of this data had previous been treated by Amorim [2005] and on numerous unpublished and unrestricted technical reports at Universidade Federal da Bahia, among other cited sources. We now present a novel interpretation of this data, adding original data into our analysis and looking on the seasonal dynamical patterns, covering dry (September, 2004) and rainy (July, 2005) conditions. This chapter intends to summarize the regional Baea de Camamu physical setting and investigate the inner dynamics, the seasonal variability and the major driving factors, being a science contribution regarding the multidisciplinary discussion on Baea de Camamu maritime planning and preservation. The geographical framework is presented in Figure 1.1, bottom right.\nIn Chapter 4, tidal signals are added to the Eastern Brazilian Margin numerical model system discussed on Chapter 2. The model, now receives two separated one-way\noff-line nested domains with spatial resolution of ~ 3km and ~ 1km, comprising the coastal and estuarine systems in the zone between the cities of Salvador and Ilheus and higher resolution focus on Baia de Camamu. The primary objective is to evaluate the model system response by using a simple model configuration (that applies constant bottom stress and homogeneous hydrographic conditions) and to investigate the nature of the barotropic tidal propagation along different spatial scales, towards the shallower domains on the shelf, near shore and inner Baia de Camamu. Secondly, is discussed the paths to follow in order to set a coastal modelling system that allows estuarine connections and some science hypotheses are discussed based on the tidal simulation results. The geographical framework comprises grids L2 and a local grid (L3), similar to the Baia de Camamu framework, presented in Figure 1.1.\nAlong this thesis, the connections between scales are focused in various aspects, such as in the large and meso scale interplay discussed on Chapter 2, or at the tidal propagation, englobing various spatial scales, discussed on Chapter 4. Finally, the closing Chapter5 discusses ideas for future studies, remarking what was achieved on each topic.\nFigure 1.1: Outline of the Eastern Brazilian Margin, depicting the large, mesoscale and regional grids bathymetry and Baia de Camamu framework.

Apart from a complex geometry around the Abrolhos Banks, on its southern limit, the EBM presents a dominantly open and narrow continental shelf, receives low river discharges and is almost entirely covered by biogenic carbonate sediments [Knoppers et al., 1999]. According to the SeaWiFS global primary productivity [U. S. Department of Commerce, 2004], this margin is considered a Class III, low productivity ecosystem (&lt;150gC/m2/yr).\ngyre. As the southern branch of the SEC approaches the EBM, carrying subtropical Benguela Current water towards the shelf, it bifurcates into the northward flowing North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) and the southward flowing Brazil Current (BC) [Stramma et al., 1990; Stramma and Schott, 1999]. According to Rodrigues et al. [2007], this bifurcation latitude varies poleward with depth, from 10\u00b0S to 14\u00b0S near the surface to 27\u00b0S at the 1000 m depth.\nFigure 2.1: Schematic diagram of the main EBM flow patterns. The acronyms indicate the estimated position for the South Equatorial Current (SEC), the Brazil Current (BC), the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) and the North Brazil Current (NBC). The colored vectors refer to the water masses distribution, indicating the layers associated to the Tropical Water (TW), the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The Abrolhos Bank (AB), Baza de Todos os Santos (BTS), Baia de Camamu (CMU) and the reference transects used on section 2.4 are also indicated.\nWhile the NBC is an intense western boundary current and the dominant surface circulation feature in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean [Silveira et al., 1994], the BC is a weak and shallow western boundary flow [e.g., Evans et al., 1983]. It carries warm water along the Brazilian coast, from its origin to about 38\u00b0S, when it leaves the coast, forming the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence [Gordon, 1989]. At tropical latitudes, the BC is a shallow flow characterized only by the oligotrophic, warm and salty Tropical Water (TW, T > 20\u00b0C and S > 36) [Emilsson, 1961]. As the BC reaches subtropical latitudes it becomes deeper and gradually incorporates the nutrient-richer, colder and fresher South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, 6\u00b0C &lt;T &lt;20\u00b0C and 34.6 &lt;S &lt;36) [Miranda, 1985]. Reid [1989] defines this SACW southward flow to be found at latitudes south of 20\u00b0C.\nUntil now, the most functional description of the oceanographic processes on the EBM are probably the works of Stramma et al. [1990] and Rodrigues et al. [2007]. The first authors, based on a historical hydrographic data set, described the geostrophic circulation for the region, while Rodrigues et al. [2007] investigated the seasonal variability of the SEC bifurcation. According to Rodrigues et al. [2007], on the upper thermocline, the bifurcation variability is associated to changes in the local wind stress curl due to the annual north-south excursion of the marine ITCZ complex. On the top 200 m, the bifurcation latitude reaches its southernmost position in July (~ 17\u00b0S) and its northernmost position in November(~ 13\u00b0S). As the SEC bifurcation moves south (north), the NBUC transport increases (decreases) and the BC transport decreases (increases).\nthe frontiers but unfortunately, the available data are still scarce and irregularly sampled on time and space, as summarizes Stramma et al. [1990], using most of the data ever surveyed on the region. Therefore, possible ways to cope with this problem, according to Penven et al. [2006] are: i) to have the boundary conditions provided from an independent basin-scale or a global model, which according to those authors may generate doubtful consistency with the local simulation or ii) to develop a nested grid capability, where a hierarchy of embedded, structured-grid models are able to interact between each other. In this work we adopted the second procedure and here the regional boundary condition is provided by the courser grid run, whose boundary conditions themselves come from a global model, with compatible resolution and processes.\nThe EBM encompasses many important coastal systems, such as Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos (BTS), Baia de Camamu (CMU) and the Abrolhos Bank (Figure 2.1). The BTS, the second largest coastal embayment along the Brazilian coast with 1086km2 [Lessa et al., 2001], is located adjacent to the city of Salvador, a metropolitan area with over 3 million inhabitants, being impacted by the pressure of an intensive industrial, commercial and fishing activity [Le\u00e3o, 2002]. The CMU, located just 100 km south of Salvador, is an important fishing, mining and tourist site, surrounded by an extensive mangrove vegetation. Finally, the Abrolhos Bank is a site of great biological importance, holding a reef complex that occupies an area of approximately 6,000 km2, representing the southernmost and most extensive coral reef environmental in the South Atlantic [Le\u00e3o, 2002]. Despite the fact that the EBM extends over a zone with such social and environmental relevance, its marine connectivity is virtually unknown.\nof the model itself. The second and third parts of the results discusses the main aspects of seasonal and spatial circulation patterns on the EBM, respectively while in the forth and final part of the results, some of the possible interactions between the meanders, the shelf and the near-coastal processes are explored, as an attempt to establish a first order description of the mesoscale activities revealed by the regional simulation. Finally, the last section of this manuscript presents a summary of the major results presented, emphasizing the physical aspects of the EBM temporal and spatial connectivity.\n2.2\tThe modeling design and the two nested grids\nThe numerical model used in this study is a primitive, nested, three dimensional, stretched terrains - sigma following curvilinear coordinate, Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) [Haidvogel et al., 2000; Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005]. ROMS applies the Boussinesq approximation and hydrostatic balance, solving the momentum equations in a Earth-centered rotating environment.\nIn this work a two level, one way nesting capability has been integrated into ROMS to obtain mesoscale solutions, while preserving the large-scale circulation. The nesting downscaling was performed through the Adaptive Refinement in Fortran (AGRIF) procedure, through the ROMS-AGRIF, at ROMS Processing tools [Penven, 2003]. This 1-way embedding procedure has been successfully applied in various dynamical systems, such as the Peru Current System [Penven et al., 2005], the Californian Upwelling System [Penven et al., 2006] and the Western Iberian Shelf [Teles-Machado et al., 2007], among others.\nnear-shore currents have a spatial scale of o(1-30) km, while the offshore dynamics has a spatial scale o(30-100) km, the MG (~ 9 km grid cell resolution) is then capable of solving the mesoscale dynamics connecting the near-shore, the shelf and the ocean basin, while the LG (~ 27 km grid cell resolution) is intended to solve the large scale dynamics.\n54\u00b0W\t45\u00b0W\n36\u00b0W\t27\u00b0W\t18\u00b0W\n(a)\nFigure 2.2: ROMS nested grid system and bathymetry used: (a) Large Grid (LG) and (b) Mesoscale Grid (MG). Solid lines represent the 50 (MG only), 100 (MG only), 200, 1000 and 4000 m isobaths. The 2000, 3000 and 5000 m isobaths are represented as dotted lines\nThe model was initialized with Levitus climatology and forced by climatological monthly winds, heat and fresh water fluxes from the COADS - Comprehensive OceanAtmosphere Data Set [Da Silva et al., 1994], running for a 15 years period. The strategy adopted was to run the LG grid alone for the first ten years and then to have the oneway nesting procedure implemented for the following 5 years run. The LG uses radia-tional, active, implicit, open boundary conditions, where the solution at the boundary is nudged towards dated monthly mean outputs (1990 to 2004) of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis [Carton et al., 2000b,a]. The lateral boundary conditions for the MG were provided by the LG grid. Explicit lateral viscosity is null in the entire domain except at the sponge layers (the closest 6 grid lines from the boundary), where it increases smoothly to a value of 1000 m2 s-1 for LG and 330 m2 s-1 for MG. A nonlocal, K-profile planetary (KPP) boundary layer scheme [Large et al., 1994]\nparameterizes the sub-grid-scale vertical mixing processes.\nThe bottom topography was interpolated from ETOPO2 - 2\u2019 gridded global relief data [U. S. Department of Commerce, 2001] for both grids and, where necessary, it was smoothed to fit the bathymetric gradient to a maximum slope factor (r = Ah/(h1 + h2) = 0.2), in order to prevent pressure gradient errors associated to the sigma coordinate system [Haidvogel et al., 2000]. Tables 2.1 summarize the model configuration for LG and MG grids.\nTable 2.1: Model configuration parameters\nParameter\tLG\tMG\t\nL\t179\t138\tPts. in longitude direction\nM\t169\t141\tPts. in latitude direction\nAS\t1/4\u00b0\t1/12\u00b0\tHorizontal resolution\nAt\t1800 s\t600 s\tBaroclinic time step\nAtf\t40 s\t13.3\tBarotropic time step\nCommon Parameters\t\t\t\nN\t30\t\tNumber of s-levels\n\u00a9s\t6.0\t\tSigma coord. stretch. factor\nD\t10.0 m\t\tMinimum model depth\nR\t3.0 x 10-4m.s-1\t\tLinear bottom drag coeff.\n2.3\tThe model validation approach\nThe basis of validation is to assess a model response by comparing its output to physically measured data, such as currents, hydrography or mesoscale variability. Mesoscale variability is a major characteristic of ocean dynamics and may be estimated with global coverage altimetric data [Brachet et al., 2004]. A validation of the LG model results with altimetric derived mesoscale variability is presented on sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. This procedure assumes a special interest, regarding the paucity of in situ data available [Backeberg, 2006]. Further on, a comparison of modeled transport with selected transport values from the literature is presented on section 2.3.3.\n2.3.1\tEddy kinetic energy\nThe ocean mesoscale variability was estimated based on the eddy kinetic energy (EKE), calculated from TOPEX/Poseidon, ERS-1/2 and Jason combined data for sea level anomaly (SLA), obtained from the archiving, validation, and interpretation of satellites oceanographic - AVISO [Ducet et al., 2000]. Since mesoscale structures present typical time-space scales of 10 to 100 days and 50 to 500 km, the merging of multi altimeter data on the AVISO data set allows for a realistic sea level and geostrophic velocity calculation, resulting on a good quality mesoscale observation [Ducet et al., 2000]. The altimeter SLA data used covers a 5 years period, from January 2000 to December 2004 and presents a 1/3\u00b0 spatial resolution.\nused in this analysis.\nBoth altimetric (SLA) and the model (MSLA) were used to compute the surface zonal (Ug\u2019) and meridional (Vg\u2019) velocity anomalies, using the geostrophic approximation :\n7'5\"\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\nWhere, g is the gravity acceleration, f, the Coriolis parameter, dy/dx and dy/dy are the meridional and zonal gradients of SLA and MSLA. The variance of the velocity anomaly field corresponds to the eddy kinetics energy (EKE):\nEKE =|1 {(Ug')2 \u25a0'.\t(2.3)\nFigure 2.3 (left panels) present the mean EKE distribution for altimetry (top) and ROMS (bottom) along the LG domain, while Figure 2.3 (right panels) presents a zoom of the same distribution on the EBM region. Maximum values of EKE are found on the energetic, equatorial zonal circulation. Minimum values are found on the oceanic region located between 8\u00b0S to 24\u00b0S. In the EBM, an EKE intensification occurs on the outer shelf vicinity, reflecting the high variability of the western boundary dynamics associated to the northward flow of the NBC system and the southward BC flow. South of this region, the LG domain shows the BC flow, marked by relative high EKE variability along the southern coast of Brazil. Secondary EKE peaks, with values > 300 cm2s-2 are seen around ~ 35\u00b0S, marking the confluence of the BC with the northward flow of the Malvinas Current system [Saraceno et al., 2004].\n48\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t24\u00b0W\t12\u00b0W\n10\u00b0S\n12\u00b0S\n14\u00b0S\n16\u00b0S\n18\u00b0S\n39\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t33\u00b0W\t30\u00b0W\n\u25b2\n48\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t24\u00b0W\t12\u00b0W\n10\u00b0S\n12\u00b0S\n14\u00b0S\n16\u00b0S\n18\u00b0S\n39\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t33\u00b0W\t30\u00b0W\nFigure 2.3: Mean EKE (cm2 s-2) in the western South Atlantic (left) and detailed representation in the Eastern Brazilian Margin (right). The top panels represent the Altimeter and the lower panels represent ROMS. Dashed lines represent the 200 and 2000 m isobaths. Color scale is broken for values > 450cm2.s-2 (left) and > 200cm2.s-2 (right).\n100\nFigure 2.4: Mean zonal EKE distribution (cm2 bars represents the standard deviation from the\ns-2) from altimeter and ROMS. Error mean.\nOverall, ROMS captures the spatial EKE distribution with reasonable confidence, but tends to underestimate the ocean variability towards the northern (e.g., the energetic equatorial circulation zone) and the southern grid extensions (e.g., the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone). An extended LG domain could possibly reduce this effect but also increase the computational time. Along the EBM, ROMS captures the larger energy associated to the western boundary currents, but shows larger variability and higher mean EKE, which could be partially ascribed to the remaining differences on the spacial resolution between ROMS and the altimetry.\nconvergence.\n2.3.2\tSea surface height anomalies\nThe austral summer and winter mean distribution for sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) is presented on Figure 2.5 for the altimetry (left) and ROMS (right) along the Western South Atlantic. A similar procedure was used by Penven et al. [2005] to validate ROMS along the Pacific coast of Peru.\naltimeter\nROMS summer\n48\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t24\u00b0W\t12\u00b0W\nROMS winter\n48\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t24\u00b0W\t12\u00b0W\nHigher anomalies are noticeable above the Equator and bordering the outer shelf, south of 10\u00b0S. For the later case, the elongated outer shelf feature is coincident with the BC region and is associated with the intensification of the coastal upwelling events during summer, enhancing the negative anomalies. During winter, the prevalent southeast winds regime increase the Ekman transport towards the coast, intensifying the positive anomalies. Major differences between the EKE maps of altimetry and the model are found in the region comprised from 2\u00b0N to 4\u00b0S, east of 24\u00b0W during winter. Altimetry suggests that EKE is much reduced in that region but such behavior is not seen in ROMS. This may be related to the failure of ROMS to reproduce some features of the equatorial circulation due to imposition of artificial boundaries on its vicinity. At latitudes higher than 24\u00b0S, the anomalies show a very irregular pattern, with an increase of variability values at the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone. Despite certain discrepancies, ROMS is able to capture the SSHA seasonality and presents a reasonably good spatial agreement with the altimeter data, particulary along the EBM.\n2.3.3\tThe large scale flow pattern and transport validation\nFrom ROMS LG model results, the general circulation patterns on the Western South Atlantic evolves from a zonal regime, typical for the equatorial dynamics, to a more irregular oceanic regime, towards higher latitudes (Figure 2.6). Along the EBM, the SEC feeds the western boundary current system, imposing variability and determining the flow patterns.\nFigure 2.6: Annual mean flow (vectors) and stream function (isolines) in the western South Atlantic integrated for the layer: (a) 0-100 m and (b) 100-500 m, LG model results. The vector scale is 0.4 m s-1 for (a) and 0.2 m s-1 for (b).\nAccording to these patterns, most of the top (0-500 m) EBM is characterized by an opposing flow, where the southward surface flow, associated to the BC, is opposed to a northward flow, underneath, associated to the NBUC. The BC appears as a relatively weaker flow that runs along the Brazilian coast and gets stronger beyond 24\u00b0S. At latitudes north of 10oS the NBUC merges with the surface flow and the NBC system emerges, appearing as an intensified northwestward flow, moving beyond the Equator.\nIn order to compare our modeled results with observation, we summarized some typical EBM transport values from literature on Table 2.2. Most of the existing values are based on geostrophic estimates from historical and highly spaced hydrographic data, presenting a qualitative view of the flow but possibly biasing narrow flows, such as the intense NBUC flow, whose core is confined to a width of less than 100 km along most of the EBM (Figure 2.7). Nevertheless, geostrophic estimates are still a reference for model validation in spite of a few direct measurements made in the upper EBM (Table\n2.2).\nSchott et al. [2005], based on current meter array series, found a mean transport of\n15.3\tSv for the upper NBUC at 11\u00b0S. The same authors, but based on five LADCP ship transects also found a mean transport of 13.5 Sv at the (ae &lt;26.8) layer section, west of 31.5\u00b0S (Table 2.2). These values are compatible with our model result of 14.2 Sv for the northward annual transport for the layer 0-400 m at 11\u00b0S (not shown) and higher than the geostrophic estimate of 4.7 Sv at 10\u00b0S and the 5.7 Sv geostrophic estimate for the 9\u00b0 \u2014 13\u00b0S transect, presented by Stramma et al. [1990].\nReferences: 1. Stramma et al. [1990]; 2. Schott et al. [2005];\n3. Miranda and Castro [1982]; 4. Evans et al. [1983];\nLatitude/ Transect Long.\tDepth Ref.\tData Period\tTransp.

Miranda and Castro |1982] estimated the BC transport to be of\n6.5\tSv, with most of it occurring on the first 200 m. Stramma et al. [1990], using a similar data set (a closer sampled transect from September 1967) with a slightly different reference level, found a southward net transport of 0.8 Sv, for the section west of 30\u00b0S, and a BC estimate of 3.7 Sv, suggesting an intensive opposing flow along the section. Other estimates (Table 2.2) show the BC transport varying from 1.0 to\n5.3\tSv . Our model presents an annual mean of 2.8 Sv for the surface layer (not shown).\nBelow the SACW layer, there are two major water masses, the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Both layer presents a well defined circulation in our model. North of 25\u00b0S, and apart from some recirculation, the AAIW layer flows towards the Equator. Stramma and England [1999] center the SEC bifurcation at the AAIW layer south of 25\u00b0 S. The model flow at the NADW layer reveals a continuous southward flow and again, a significant recirculation at the EBM, probably a reflection of the complex margin bathymetry. Although, we do not further discuss the results for the AAIW and NADW layers, the general flow pattern reported in the literature [e.g., Stramma and England, 1999; Silveira et al., 2000; Cirano et al., 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2007] seen to be captured by the model.\nMoreover, considering the nesting capability, the LG and MG solutions exhibited a similar vertical structure. For comparison, the mean zonal section at 14\u00b0S for January is represented in Figure 2.7 for both grids. On the top 1500 m, they simulate a well defined western boundary flux, with the BC being represented by a southward surface flow extending to about 150 m on the shelf/slope region. Below this surface flow, the most prominent feature is the northward flowing SACW and AAIW, which extends from 200 m to about 1500 m. It is interesting to notice that, at depths deeper than 1500 m, the MG solution shows a less intense and more realistic southward NADW flow (velocities around 0.1 m s-1), not underneath the AAIW flow, but with some displacement to the east. Although both solutions resemble a similar structure, the MG presents a more\ndetailed and accurate vertical flow distribution than the LG results, reflecting the more realistic bathymetric outline and the efficiency of the nesting procedure.\n(a)\nFigure 2.7: Vertical section at 14\u00b0S of the modeled mean meridional velocity from (a) MG and (b) LG, in January. Red (blue) shades represent positive northward (negative southward) flow. The isotherms of 20\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C indicate the interfaces between TW/SACW and SACW/AAIW, respectively. The contour interval is 0.1 m s-1 and the acronyms are indicated in Figure 2.1.\n(b)\n2.4\tThe seasonal cycle\nIn order to investigate the seasonality of the circulation on the EBM, we analyzed monthly mean results for MG, calculated over a five years period and based on ten days average outputs. Focusing on the western boundary dynamics, zonal sections were established at the center of the region (14OS) and symmetrically on the northern (10OS) and southern (18OS) extensions of the domain. A meridional section was also established along 34OW meridian, in order to evaluate the SEC transport into the system. The reference sections are illustrated in Figure 2.1. The zonal section position combined with the EBM bathymetric outline may be visualized in Figure 2.8.\nFigure 2.8: Diagram outlining the position of the zonal sections on the EBM. The vertical structure is an representation of a 10 days average of the meridional velocity (m s-1), with illustrative purposes only.\nThe spatial and temporal variability on the EBM meridional flow through these 3 sections is synthesized in Figure 2.9, which shows the vertical structure for January, April, July and October at these sections. The isotherms of 20\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C indicate the interfaces between TW/SACW and SACW/AAIW, respectively.\nFigure 2.9 shows that the EBM is subject to a marked spatial character and an intense seasonal variability. For instance, the south flowing BC appears as a seasonal flow (January and October) confined to the top few meters at 10\u00b0S and as a deeper and permanent flow at 18\u00b0S. This flow is stronger towards the austral summer. On the other hand, the north flowing NBUC appears as a permanent feature along the entire domain, getting stronger and merging with the surface flow at the northern section. The NBUC transport peaks towards the middle of the year. Quantitative transport estimates provides the basis for a EBM dynamics characterization, which is described next.\nConsidering that our main interest is the shelf-slope region, the meridional volume transport was calculated on each section, from the coast to the eastern limit of the main flow, which lies approximately at the 4000 m isobath. Therefore, at 10\u00b0S, the transport section was set between 34\u00b0W to 36\u00b0W, at 14\u00b0S, between 37\u00b0W to 39\u00b0W and at 18\u00b0S, between 35\u00b0W to 39.5\u00b0W. The wider section at 18\u00b0S is due to an extended continental shelf, a factor that determines a less confined surface flow on that latitude. Although the calculated transport is depended on the extension adopted, and that does not attain to a very strict criteria, we have observed that by promoting small variations on the length of the sections, the relation between the fluxes tends to remain constant. The mean meridional transport values are presented for both components of the flow and are separated in two vertical layers, here named surface (0-100 m) and sub-surface (100-500 m).\n-36\t-35.8 -35 6 -35.4 -35 2\t-35\t-34.8 -34 6 -34 4 -34 2\t-34\n-100\n-200\n-300\n-400\n-500\n-1000\n-1500\n-2000\n-2500\n-3000\n-3500\n-4000\n-39\t-38.8 -38 6 -38.4 -38 2\t-38\t-37 8 -37 6 -37 4 -37 2\t-37\n-36\t-35.8 -35 6 -35 4 -35 2 -35 -34 8 -34 6 -34 4 -34 2\t-34\t-39 -38.8 -38 6 -38.4 -38 2 -38\t-37 8 -37 6 -37 4 -37 2 -37\n-36\t-35.8 -35 6 -35.4 -35 2 -35 -34 8 -34 6 -34 4 -34 2\t-34\n(10OS)\nTo evaluate the onshore transport entering the EBM, mostly through the SEC flow, the zonal transport was calculated on two segments along 34\u00b0W, a northern segment from 10\u00b0S to 14\u00b0S and a southern segment from 14\u00b0S to 18\u00b0S. For these meridional sections, we present the net transport integrated over the two vertical layers defined above.\nBased on the analysis of the transport summarized in Figure 2.10 (left panels), we observe that at the surface layer, the southward transport presents a flow increment towards higher latitudes, with mean annual values of 0.5 Sv (10\u00b0S), 2.4 Sv (14\u00b0S) and 2.8 Sv (18\u00b0S). The annual surface transport is dominantly towards the north, at 10\u00b0S, with a net transport of 2.7 Sv and dominantly towards the south at 18\u00b0S, with a net transport of 1.0 Sv. This suggests that the BC appears as the dominant surface boundary current at 18\u00b0S, while at 10\u00b0S, the NBC/NBUC system is the main dominant surface feature. At the middle section, 14\u00b0S, the resultant annual surface transport (net of 0.4 Sv) is slightly towards the south. The seasonal pattern however suggests an alternate dominance of the circulation throughout the year.\nAt the sub-surface layer (Figure 2.10, right panels), the northward flow is clearly dominated by the NBUC transport, carrying SACW toward equatorial regions. This transport presents an increment of 6.6 Sv, varying from 8.5 Sv at 18\u00b0S to 15.1 Sv at 10\u00b0S. A steady latitudinal transport increment is observed on the southward transport. In general, the southward sub-surface transport is lower than the surface layer transport (Figure 2.10, left panels), except at 18\u00b0S, where it gets slightly stronger, indicating a deepening of the BC flow toward higher latitudes. The net transports at the sub-surface layer is always northward oriented, presenting an increment of 9.1 Sv from the southern section to the northern section.\nAt 10\u00b0S, the NBC/NBUC is the dominant dynamical feature. The annual variability of the transport presents a similar behavior between the surface and the sub-surface layers and a marked seasonal signal. The peak transport occurs in July and is coherent with the largest zonal inflow at 34\u00b0W presented in Figure 2.11. The southward flow,\nwhich for most of the year transports under 1 Sv, also presents a marked seasonality, reaching a peak of 2 Sv at the end of the year. A question still opened is that if such transport could be ascribed to the origin of the BC.\nFigure 2.10: Annual cycle of the monthly mean transport (Sv) estimates along the zonal sections at 10\u00b0S (top panels), 14\u00b0S (middle panels) and 18\u00b0S (bottom panels).

For instance, the annual mean zonal inflow entering the northern segment is 8.8 Sv and the increment in the northward transport from 14\u00b0S (12.8 Sv) to 10\u00b0S is of 5.6 Sv, reaching a total of 18.4 Sv. The remaining one third of the SEC zonal transport goes to the BC flow, whose increment in the southward transport from 10\u00b0S (1.1 Sv) to 14\u00b0S is about 2.9 Sv, reaching a total value of 4.0 Sv.\nFigure 2.11: Annual cycle of the monthly mean net transport (Sv) estimates along the two meridional sections at 34\u00b0W. The top panels represent the northern segment (14\u00b0S to 10\u00b0S) and the bottom panels represent the southern segment (18\u00b0S to 14\u00b0S). Westward transport is positive. The left panels represent the surface layer (0-100 m) and the right panels represent the sub-surface layer (100-500 m). The annual mean net transport is indicated inside the boxes.\nAt 14\u00b0S, the transport cycle along the year presents a different character from the surface to the sub-surface layer. At the surface layer, a bimodal seasonal signal suggests an alternate dominance of the circulation, with the NBUC flow dominating from April to September and the BC flow dominating from October to March. Therefore, periods of maximum mean transport of the BC are associated to minimum transport of the NBUC. For August and September the dominance is not clear. At the sub-surface layer, the NBUC resembles a normal distribution, with the maximum mean occurring in July. In this layer, the southward transport shows an increment trend in December and a secondary peak in March, in agreement with the top layer behavior.\nThe 18\u00b0S section is the first section to present a clear dominance of the BC flow, at the surface layer, throughout the year. This flow presents a annual mean of 2.8 Sv, reaching as much as 5 Sv on February. At the sub-surface layer, the NBUC, although weaker when compared to the sections further north, is still dominant along the year.\nAgain, by applying an approximate transport balance, considering the 0-500 m water column, we may have an estimate of the SEC zonal inflow through the southern segment (Figure 2.11). The annual mean zonal inflow from 18OS to 14OS is 3.6 Sv. The increment in the northward transport from 18OS to 14OS is 2.4 Sv, reaching an annual value of 12.8 Sv at 14OS. The BC flow presents a flow increment of 1.9 Sv, from 14OS to 18OS, reaching a total value of 5.9 Sv at 18OS. Although this estimate shows an unbalance of the order of 0.8 Sv, the results suggest that at this latitude range, the SEC divergence shows the tendency to feed evenly both the northward and the southward flows.\nFurthermore, the EBM presents an intense spatial variability, presenting many circulation cells, whose interaction with the main field was also registered on our transport estimates. This spatial variability will be discussed on the next section.\n2.5\tSpatial variability and dynamical zones\nAiming to look at the EBM spatial variability, mean temporal fields were computed for the sea surface height and for the flow pattern, at both the surface (comprising mostly the TW) and sub-surface (comprising mostly the SACW) layers (Figure 2.12). For instance, the mean field for January is dominated by an irregular flow pattern, where a succession of cyclonic and anticyclonic mesoscale gyres promotes intense cross-shelf water exchanges.\nand loses its signature gradually in October and November.\nThe middle zone, located from 13\u00b0S to 16\u00b0S (on the oceanic zone comprised between the cities of Salvador and Ilh\u00e9us) is characterized by two distinct and well defined flow regime during the year. From October to March, the main flow is dominated by the southward flowing BC (see Figure 2.10 for the mean monthly transports and Figure 2.12b,c for the flow fields for January and October), while from April to September, the NBUC northward flow is dominant (see Figure 2.12b,c for the mean monthly fields for April and July). A less marked transitional flow pattern is revealed in April, August and September. Its important to remind that for the BC, most of the flow is confined to the top 100 m. The shelf width in this region is very narrow and the coastal circulation reveals to be closely tied to the oceanic mesoscale processes, with intensification or flow reversals being associated to these features. The knowledge of such variability is particularly important here since the region between the bays (BTS and CMB in Figure 2.1) is very relevant to fishery and oil activities.\nThe southern zone, from 16\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S, is marked by an extended and irregular shelf, developed between two major banks, the Royal Charlotte Bank (16\u00b0S) and the Abrolhos Bank (Figure 2.1). This irregular topography constraints and alters the flow, inducing spatial variability in physical, chemical and biological features over the shelf [Knoppers et al., 1999] and in adjacent oceanic waters.\nPereira et al. [2005] found an evidence of cross isobath residual barotropic currents due to tide interaction with topography. The authors reported that this process was particularly important on the southern flanks of the Abrolhos banks, where the tidal ellipses associated to the northern propagation of the barotropic tide were perpendicular to the slope of the flanks. The result for this interaction was the generation of upwelling favorable areas on the southern part of the flank and downwelling favorable areas on the northern flanks. Upwelling and downwelling were also modeled along the flanks on the Royal Charlotte bank, although not as intense as those found on the sides of Abrolhos\nbank [Pereira et al., 2005]. Our model includes no tidal forcing and relatively cooler and fresher water were a recurrent feature on the shallow areas around Abrolhos bank, suggesting to be associated to upwelling process. Additionally, the surface flow is southward oriented throughout the year (Figure 2.12b), an indication of a perennial BC flow at this latitude. From September to April, a flux divergence, shifting between 17\u00b0 to 19\u00b0S with resultant flow towards the south, represents an intensification on the BC flow.\nWhen considering the three zones together, the flow patterns on the EBM appear to be in close agreement with the annual pattern for the trade winds, the prevailing wind system on the tropics. The trade winds are associated to the dynamics of the high pressure South Atlantic Anticyclone, blowing from east and northeast during spring and summer (October to March), when the South Atlantic Anticyclone cell is displaced towards the south, and from southeast during autumn and winter (April to September), when the anticyclone is at its northernmost position [Nimer, 1989]. Accordingly, Rodrigues et al. [2007] state that positive (negative) wind stress curl produces an anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation, whose southward (northward) component near the western boundary causes the SEC bifurcation to occur at a lower (higher) latitude during austral spring /summer (winter) months. Therefore, and in agreement with Rodrigues et al. [2007], our results show that during austral summer, when the SEC bifurcation occurs at a lower latitude, an intensification on the southward BC transport is observed, while during austral winter, when the SEC bifurcation occurs at a higher latitude, an intensification of the northward NBUC transport occurs.\n39\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t33\u00b0W\t30\u00b0 W\t39\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t33\u00b0W\t30\u00b0W\t39\u00b0W\t36\u00b0W\t33\u00b0W\t30\u00b0 W\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\nFigure 2.12: Monthly mean horizontal distribution of (a) the sea surface height(cm) and the integrated flow field for two distinct vertical layers (b) 0-100 m and (c) 100-500 m.

The dotted line on those plots indicates the 200 m isobath.\n2.6\tEddy interactions on the Eastern Brazilian Margin\nThe model results reveal an intense mesoscale activity along the EBM. These mesoscale features coexist with the large-scale circulation, may evolve into eddies and, in such cases, have a certain life time and a translation character. In this section, we discuss the behavior of a cyclonic and an anticyclonic eddy, detached from the main flow along a modeled annual cycle. Although mesoscale features are recurrent in all years of the model results, here and for a qualitative analysis, we only discuss the model results for the fifth MG year cycle, as reference.\nWe start our description with the cyclonic eddy (Figure 2.13), formed at the offshore region just north of the Abrolhos Bank (18OS). The geneses of this feature involves the interaction with two neighboring anticyclonic eddies (Figure 2.13a). The most important contribution comes from the northern eddy, which approaching from the upper limit of the Royal Charlotte Bank (16OS), favors an intense zonal flow. Due to local bathymetric constraints, this eddy plunges parcels of shelf waters toward deep waters (Figure 2.13a). On its origin, the cyclonic eddy incorporates cooler, coastal upwelled water (surface temperature in the coastal vicinity over the Abrolhos Bank is around 24OC, whereas the adjacent oceanic waters is around 28OC). After being formed, the cyclonic eddy gets individualized and remained almost stationary for more than a month (Figure 2.13b). After so, it shows a translation character and rapidly propagates northward. At this point, the feature experiences a reorganization, assuming an elliptical shape (Figure 2.13c), being finally observed at the northern part of the EBM on the mid of June (Figure 2.13d). A composite altimetric image from AVISO on mid April 2004, and the calculated geostrophic field associated to it (Figure 2.13e), which resembles the geneses presented in Figure 2.13a, is used to illustrate the occurrence of such process in the region, showing compatible length and time scales.\n(a)\n(b)\nI\n39\n28\n27\n25\n25\n24\n23\n(c) (d)\nThe second pattern described here is related to the anticyclonic eddy (Figure 2.14). The formation of this feature was traced back to August, at around 12OS (Figure 2.14a). The feature propagates southward, following the main flow for the period of a month or so (Figure 2.14b), when it then interacts with the shelf region and appears better individualized and intensified during the period of October/November (Figures 2.14c,d). In analogy to what was presented for the cyclonic feature, a composite altimetric image for the mid of September 2004 with the associated calculated geostrophic distribution (Figure 2.14e), presents a well defined anticyclonic eddy, north of 16OS, adding physical evidence to our model results. It is important to emphasize that, for either cases, our description is focused on the major feature and its related translation pattern. Less important features, sometimes presenting erratic patterns have also been observed.\nOn our model results, a typical southward extension for the anticyclonic feature is coincident with the region limited by the northern flank of the Abrolhos Bank, which is also the geneses region for the cyclonic feature. The translation patterns appear to be temporally connected to the intensification of the main seasonal EBM flow patterns, with the cyclonic northward translations occurring preferentially in the first half of the year (when the NBUC starts to intensify) and the anticyclonic southward propagation occurring in the second half of the year (when the BC starts to intensify).\nOn their pathways, these features interact with the near-shelf region. Their dynamical structure during such events, the cyclonic eddy during mid February (Figure 2.13b) and the anti-cyclonic eddy during mid November (Figure 2.14d), are explored in two specific sub-sections. Our aim here is to foster new ideas on the EBM near shelfdynamics, specially regarding the impacts of the remote forcing on the local circulation.\n(a) (b)\nFurthermore, Campos [2006], invokes a possible northward propagation behavior for the cyclonic Vitoria eddy. Our MG domain (Figure 2.2) does not extends south of the Abrolhos Banks, where the Vitoria eddy has been experimentally reported [Schmid et al., 1995]. An extra experiment set however, with a larger domain (not shown), has shown evidences of a recurrent Vitoria eddy, south of the Abrolhos Banks as well as the mesoscale dynamics described above. According to our analysis, these features may not be referred to a northward propagation of the Vitoria eddy, but as mesoscale features, formed north of 19\u00b0S, that indeed present a seasonal northward propagation character.\n2.6.1\tSnapshot over a cyclonic eddy\nOn mid February, a mesoscale cyclonic eddy appeared well developed, centered at ~ 17.25\u00b0S and 36.25\u00b0W (Figure 2.13b), on the offshore waters adjacent to the Abrolhos bank. At that time, the eddy was cyclonic (clockwise), associated with a negative sea surface height reaching up to 11 cm on the core. it had a 130 km diameter, remaining stationary for a few days. At 10 m depth, it presented maximum cross-shore (u) velocity component of 0.85 m/s eastwards at its northern limit (16.25\u00b0S) and of 0.95 m/s westwards at its southern limit (18.25\u00b0S). The alongshore velocity component (v) reached 0.83 m/s southwards at the eastern limit (35.25\u00b0W) and 0.71 m/s northwards at the western limit (37.25\u00b0W).\nFigure 2.15 shows a latitudinal (top panels) and meridional (bottom panels) section of the velocity structure and the associated hydrographic properties. The isotherms (Figure 2.15b) and isohaline contours (Figure 2.15c) are tilted upwards on the center of the eddy, suggesting an eddy induced upwelling, whose effect extends over the 500 m depth. On the coast side of the eddy, a prograding front, noticed on the hydrographic sections, suggests that offshore water is brought to the shelf domain, a possible combined effect of the coastal upwelling process and the cyclonic translation. The divergence of the surface layers also favors the southwards near-shelf flow (Figure 2.15a), inducing an intense zonal flow and a sharp flow gradient with the cyclonic eddy itself.\n0.2\n-02\n-5 0\n-10 0\n-150\n--0 0\n--0 0\n-300\n--C\n1000\n1500\n2000|-\n2500^\n3000\n3500\n4500^\n(a)\n-III 2\n-5 o|\n-10 0\n-150\n--0 0\n--5 0\n-300\n--C\n-1000\n-1500\n-2000\n-2500\n-3000\n-3500\n-19\t-18.5\t-18\t-17.5\t-17\t-16.5\t-16\nTH\n1..\"\n(b)\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.15: Latitudinal (top) and Meridional (bottom) sectional structure for Velocity (a), Temperature (b) and Salinity (c) along a modeled cyclonic (clockwise) eddy on the EBM, on mid February. The location of these sections are represented in Figure 2.13b.\n2.6.2\tSnapshot over an anti-cyclonic eddy\nOn mid November, a mesoscale eddy, appeared at ~ 14.00OS and 37.75OW, at the vicinity of Baia de Camamu and Baia de Todos os Santos, the two major coastal systems on the EBM (Figure 2.14d). This eddy was anti-cyclonic (anti-clockwise), reaching a positive sea surface height of 25 cm at the core. It presented an elliptical shape on surface, with a minor latitudinal axis of ~ 175 km and a major longitudinal axis of ~ 250 km. At 10 m depth, the velocity field extended to a diameter of ~ 270 km, and assumed a more regular shape. The eddy presented maximum cross-shore (u) velocity component of 0.8 m/s, westwards at its northern limit (13OS), with highest intensity over the shelf. At its southern limit (15OS), the highest velocity was also of 0.8 m/s eastwards, around 38.25OW. The alongshore velocity revealed a pronounced asymmetry, with the alongshore (v) component, reaching 1.2 m/s, southwards, over the shelf, at the westernmost limit (38.85OW) and 0.8 m/s, northwards, at the eastern limit(37.00OW).\nThe sections presented in Figure 2.16 for the latitudinal (top panels) and meridional (bottom panels) axis of the eddy reveal some possible connections of the anti-cyclonic feature with the regional dynamics. The isotherms (Figure 2.16b) and isohaline contours (Figure 2.16c) are tilted downwards in the center of the eddy, suggesting a downwelling process, whose effect extends to depths over 200 m. On the near coast side of the eddy, an asymmetric alongshelf flow structure and a pronounced near coast tilting up for the hydrographic properties are noticeable, suggesting water renewal, a possible result of the meander coupling with the coastal dynamics.\n0.2\n-0.2\n(a)\n0.2\n-0.2\n-5 0\n-10 0\n-15 0\n-30 0\n-250\n-300\n-500\n-1000\n-1500\n-2000\n-2500\n-3000\n-3500\nr\n-\t\u2022 36.5\n-\t\u25a0 36\n-\t- 35.5\n(b)\n(c)\n36\n35.5\n35\n34 5\nFigure 2.16: Latitudinal (top) and Meridional (bottom) sectional structure for Velocity (a), Temperature (b) and Salinity (c) along a modeled anti-cyclonic (anti-clockwise) eddy on the EBM, on mid November.

The circulation in the area, has shown to be markedly influenced by the large-scale circulation driven by the South Equatorial Current (SEC) divergence. The SEC represents the northern limb of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, a large-scale feature, that if not specified properly at the boundary, imposes the first problem for a regional circulation model. To cope with this difficulty, we adopted the nesting capability integrated into the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), retaining on the regional solution the connections and forcing from the large-scale circulation.\nIn order to validate our modeling system, in a region where the data is scarce and irregularly sampled on space and time, we made use of eddy kinetic energy estimates from satellite altimetry. Our validation procedure revealed that for the EBM zone (8\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S) there is a reasonable agreement between the mean model outputs and the satellite data. On higher energetic zones though, such as the low latitude equatorial zone or the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence zone, the model had the tendency to underestimate the ocean variability. The modeled results were also compared with the few observations available for the region and the transports obtained were compatible with those found in the literature. Based on the results above, we believe that the nesting technique adopted here have shown to be adequate and realistic to study the circulation on the EBM.\nThe EBM not only has a complex dynamics, but also hosts some of the most important coastal and biological systems along the Brazilian coast, such as the coral reef aggregation on the Abrolhos Bank region or the two major bay systems: Baia de Todos os Santos and Baia de Camamu. Apart from Stramma et al. [1990] and Rodrigues et al. [2007], and prior to this work, the EBM dynamical connectivity was virtually unknown.\nThe EBM is divided into three zones, according to their distinct seasonal dynamical features. These were geographically defined as the northern zone (8OS to 13OS), the middle zone (13OS to 16OS) and the southern zone (16OS to 20OS). The results have shown that these zones are seasonally connected either by the mean flow or by the mesoscale variability on the flow.\nThe permanent mean flow is deeply influenced by the divergence of the southern branch of SEC, which is responsible for feeding the major western boundary currents, known as the Brazil/North Brazil Current system. For the surface layer (0-100 m) and at the northern zone, the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) is the main dynamical permanent feature (annual mean transport of 3.2 Sv), while the Brazil Current (BC) is just a thin flow confined to the top few meters (annual mean transport of 0.5 Sv). As we move southwards, the BC deepens and its transport is intensified. On the middle zone, the dominance of the surface layer circulation seasonally alternates between the southward BC flow (annual transport of 2.4 Sv) and the northward NBUC flow (annual transport of 2 Sv), while around the Abrolhos Bank, on the southern zone, the BC appears as the dominant surface feature (annual transport of 2.8 Sv) and has a perennial character.\nOn subsurface waters (100-500 m), the NBUC connects the EBM continuously, with the annual mean transport increasing northwards from 8.5 Sv (18OS) to 15 Sv (10OS), while the southward BC flow increases in a reverse manner, from 0.5 Sv (10OS) to 3 Sv (18OS). Considering the surface and the sub-surface layers together and on an annual basis, our results also show that the SEC has a different contribution into the BC/NBC system according to the region. In the northern part of the domain (10OS to 14OS) only 1/3 of this zonal flow feeds the BC, while the remaining is incorporated into the NBUC flow. In the southern part of the domain (14OS to 18OS) this relation reaches an almost evenly balance.\nWhen considering the three zones together, the flow patterns on the EBM appear to be in close agreement with the annual cycle for the trade winds, the prevailing wind system for the tropics. Our results show that during austral spring and summer (when easterly and northeasterly winds prevail), the SEC bifurcation occurs at a lower latitude, and an intensification of the southward BC transport is observed. During austral autumn and winter (when southeasterly winds prevail), the SEC bifurcation occurs at a higher latitude, and an intensification of the northward NBUC transport occurs. Our results are in agreement with the pattern proposed by Rodrigues et al. [2007] for the SEC divergence.\nThe regional simulation reveals intense mesoscale activities. Well defined cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies detached from the main flow are seen translating throughout the domain along the year. The translation of these features are connected to the seasonal main EBM flow, with cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies preferably translating northward (southward) along the first (second) semester of the year. The physics involved on this dynamics are far beyond the scope of this work and continues as an open issue, which should be properly addressed in a future work.\nModeling evidences of interactions with the near-shelf dynamics are presented for both cases. Such direct connections have never been reported on the regional oceanographic literature. Considering that tropical shelves governed by western boundary currents are the least productive ocean margins of the world, unless land run-off and eddy induced shelf-edge upwelling become significant [Walsh, 1988], those interactions, if experimentally proved, may have environmental relevance on the oligotrophic EBM dynamics.\nChapter 3\n3.1\tIntroduction\nBaia de Camamu (CMB) is an important fishing, mining and touristic site located at the central coast of the state of Bahia (14OS; 39OW) on the Eastern Brazilian Margin (EBM), Figure 3.1. The CMB is a shallow system, mostly well preserved [Hatje et al.,\n2008]\tthat occupies a flooding area of 384 km2, being surrounded by small cities and extensive mangrove vegetation [Oliveira, 2000].\nof wood boat building is still active, while in other watershed surrounding zones, such as in Barra Grande, touristic activities flourishes.\nFigure 3.1: Map of Bala de Camamu, depicting its bathymetric distribution and sampling strategy.\nNevertheless, CMB occupies the central region of Camamu Basin, a marginal sedimentary cretaceous basin that extends from the coastal plains to the 2000 meters isobath, for about 130 km along the EBM. This sedimentary basin is limited on North by the Jacuipe Basin and on South by Almada Basin, occupying an area of 15000 km2 [Souza-Lima et al., 2003], granting Camamu Basin a great economic potential on oil and gas reserves [ANP, 2009]. In the past few years there has been increasing attention on CMB oil reserves and recently eighteen areas on its adjacent continental shelf were offered for concession during international auctions, including six areas located in\nshallow waters located a few kilometers from the coast. Commercial gas exploration have started on 2007 [ANP, 2009]. The local residents fears of episodic or systematic contamination of Baia de Camamu by such activities while numerical simulations performed by Amorim [2005] predict that oil spill from such oil fields, in the worst scenario, could reach the bay within one day.\nDespite the social, environmental and economic values of CMB, there is still a lack of scientific references regarding its basic climatology, physiography and hydrodynamics , which are important keys for establishing environmental precautionary plans involving oil and gas activities. In order to address this deficiency and basing on a comprehensive and original sampling effort, this work aims to provide the first time description of the physical oceanography of Baia de Camamu summarizing the physical setting and investigating the water dynamics along two distinctive sampling periods, covering dry and rainy conditions. By doing so, we give a contribution on the multidisciplinary discussion regarding its maritime planning and preservation.\nThis work was organized with the following structure. Following the introduction (section 3.1), we present the regional physical setting of Baia de Camamu (section\n3.2), which summarizes the physiography (section 3.2.1), pluviometry (section 3.2.2), fluviometry (section 3.2.3) and regional wind field (section 3.2.4). Section 3.3 provides the sampling strategy and some data processing procedures. The field contribution of this work comprises the tidal characterization and an analysis of sea level variabilities on inner Baia de Camamu (section 3.4), an evaluation of the pluviometric and discharge conditions concurrent field surveys (section 3.5) and the field data analysis, covering a dry (September 2004) and a rainy (July 2005) sampling effort (section 3.6). A summary and a discussion of the major results is presented in section 3.7 while the concluding remarks is presented in section 3.8. Finally, an appendix provides a Baia de Camamu discharge estimate, based on instantaneous basin point sources, soil composition and relative sub-basin sizes.\n3.2\tRegional settings of Baia de Camamu\nScientific references for Baia de Camamu are scarce, the majority being disperse on unpublished, hard-to-access technical reports. In this section we summarize the physical background setting, adding new interpretation to the available information. This information is the basis for the interpretation of our original survey efforts.\n3.2.1\tPhysiography\nBaia de Camamu forms a complex and shallow physiographic system that receives contribution from many tributaries. Its watershed has a mean depth of 5 m, distributed on three major connecting channels (Figure 3.2). On the north region, the Serinhaem river occupies a flooding zone of 106 km2. The central bay zone is marked by low water depths (3.3 m mean) and narrow tributaries (Igrapi\u00fana, Pinare and Sorojo rivers), which, together, occupy a flooding area of 158.3 km2. On the south region the MaraU river occupies a flooding zone of 119.4 km2. Mangrove surrounds the mean tributaries almost evenly, covering about 39% of the flooding region at the central tributaries, 43% at the MaraU system and 48% at the Serinhaem system [Amorim, 2005].\nThe CMB watershed connects with the adjacent continental shelf through one main channel ~6400 m wide, oriented SW-NE from Ponta do Apaga Fogo (SW) to Ponta do Muta (NE). This main channel has around 15 m deep on its eastern and deeper side. On its western portion the bottom topography is very irregular, being marked by the presence of numerous rocks and sand banks as shallow as 3 m. From its deeper portion, the ~6400 m wide entrance channel is reduced towards the interior of the system, being ~800 m wide at Serinhaem channel entrance, ~2200 m wide towards Mara\u00fa channel and ~1300 m wide towards the central region. Among all the CMB tributaries, only the Maraeu and the Serinhaeem present well defined channels. The Maraue has a mean depth of 6.2 m but its mean channel may reach a maximum of 37 m depth. The Serinhaem has a mean depth of 7.3 m but on its right margin the depth reaches 25.2 m. The central zone tributaries are very shallow, with depths lower than 7 m.\nFigure 3.2: Drainage basin of the main Baia de Camamu tributary system. The Serinhaem system, at the north, the Igrapiuna, Sorojo and Pinare systems at the central bay zone and the Marau channel, at the south. Representation, at 1:100.000, based on the digital cartographic database from SEI [2000]. Isocontours are precipitation curves based on SRH [2003].\nThe adjacent continental shelf has a mean width of 16 km close to the bay entrance and 12 km off to the Peninsula Marau, the elongated sedimentary barrier that separates the bay from the ocean. North of the main bay entrance there is a shallow (10 m depth) embayment where a continental shelf of 27 km width is observed. In average, the shelf breaks at 70 m depth. The bottom of CMB is covered by recent siliciclastic muds from continental origin, with variable organic content. This composition extends toward to the North portion of the Peninsula Marau, while on its oceanic region quartz sand and biodetritic material from coral algae structures are abundant [Amorim, 2005].\n3.2.2\tPluviometry\nThe latitudinal extensive coastal zone of the state of Bahia is characterized by a tropical and humid climate whose pluviometry is typically marked by high precipitation during Autumn and Winter. Spatially, the regime trends to a more uniform distribution towards the south [Araujo and Rodrigues, 2000]. To provide a regional characterization of the CMB precipitation data series from two pluviometric stations were used, The Camamu (13\u00b055.8/S; 39\u00b006'W) and Ituberd (13\u00b048'S; 39\u00b010.2'W) stations (Figure 3.1), maintained and provided by the Brazilian national water agency - ANA [ANA, 2009]. These data series cover daily information of 24 years (1964-1988) at the Camamu station and of 40 years (1964-2004) at the Ituberd station.\nThe Camamu station is located on the CMB central region and can be representative of the main watershed precipitation. The Ituberd station is located 20 km from the first station, at the Cachoeira Grande river which is the main tributary of Serinha\u00e9m system. This second station was included to provide information on the spatial rain distribution and by being located close by the only fluviometric station to monitor a discharge into CMB as will be discussed on section 3.2.3. Based on the investigation of these data series the pluviometric regime at the CMB region presents a marked seasonal signal and can be divided into a rainy period, from March to July, and a dry period, from August to February (Figure 3.2.2).\nCamamu station presents an annual mean precipitation of 2570\u00b1538 mm, with monthly mean precipitations of 244 mm during the rainy period and of 194 mm during the dry period, which is about 26% lower. Extreme mean values at this station ranges between 163 mm in September and 266 mm in July. Despite the closeness, Ituberd station presents a annual mean precipitation of 2020\u00b1342 mm, about 27% lower than at Camamu station. The seasonal monthly mean precipitation are 195 mm during the rainy and 150 mm during the dry periods and the extreme values are 137 mm in October and 219 mm in March.\nBesides the seasonality, with about a quarter less precipitation on the dry period. The pluviometric data also reveals a considerable spacial variability between the two stations. This behavior is a climatic characteristic along the Eastern Brazilian Margin, marked by a humid coastal fringe in contrast to an arid interior only few kilometers inland.\nJFMAMJJASOND\nFigure 3.3: Monthly mean precipitation on the Ituberaand Camamu pluviometric stations. Based on daily data series for 24 years (1964-1988) at the Camamu station and for 40 years (1964-2004) at the Itubera station.\n3.2.3\tFluviometry\nBaia de Camamu drainage basin covers 1450 km2, distributed between three sub-basins at its north, central and south portion (Figure 3.2). The north sub-basin covers approximately 473 km2 and have the Serinhaem river as its main tributary. On the central sub-basin the major tributaries are the Igrapiuna, Pinare and Sorojo rivers which, together, drain an area of 573 km2. The MaraU river drainage basin of 404 km2 is the south sub-basin tributary.\nWater discharge data into the CMB are restricted to the Itubera fluviometric station (13\u00b047,1'S; 39\u00b010, 58'W) operated by the Brazilian national electric energy agency - ANEEL [ANA, 2009], Figure 3.1. The Itubera fluviometric station registers daily runoff for the Cachoeira Grande river, one of the main Serinhaem river tributary, whose drainage basin covers 310 km2. Due to the lack of complimentary data sources along the Camamu basin, the Cachoeira Grande was taken as reference for the main Camamu Bay fluviometric regime, a proxy, as one considers the pluviometric gradient along the region (section 3.2.2), which among other factors, determines the surface runoff. On our analysis, we use a 33 years series of daily fluviometric data (from 1969 to 2002).\nThe annual mean discharge at Itubera station is of 5.80 m3.s-1. The monthly mean value presents high temporal variability, oscillating from a minimum of 5.1 m3.s-1 in January to a maximum of 6.9 m3.s-1 in July. Considering the seasonal cycle previously established, the rain period, from March to July, presents a mean discharge of 6.04 \u00b1 3.00 m3.s-1 while the dry period, from August to February, presents a mean discharge of 5.60 \u00b1 3.15 m3.s-1, Figure 3.4. These values are equivalent to a time permanence of 35% for the dry period and, of 43% for the rain period (Figure 3.5) and does not shows a marked seasonality. Furthermore, the mean of the maximum daily discharge oscillated from 8.6 m3.s-1 in May (on the rain period) to 12.3 m3.s-1 in December (in the dry period), suggesting the relevance of short events on the fluviometric regime (Figure 3.4).\nFigure 3.4: Annual mean Cachoeira Grande fluviogram, based on the Itubera fluviometric station data [ANA, 2009]. Dotted line represents the monthly mean discharge while solid line represents the maximum daily mean discharge. Vertical bars are the standard deviation of the mean.\nFigure 3.5: Permanence (flow duration) curve for the Itubera fluviometric station.\nTypical Baaa de Camamu inflow were virtually unknown previous this estimative. Based on the methodology presented in (section 3.9) the mean discharge into Baia de Camamu was estimated of 51 m3 s-1 for the dry period and 55.7 m3 s-1 for the rain period. Although conservative these establishes a reference for the CMB inflow.\n3.2.4\tRegional wind field\nThe largest variability found on the ocean-atmosphere interaction of the Western South Atlantic are related to the seasonal cycle. As a response, the ocean surface circulation reflects the seasonality of the wind field cycle, marked by the trade wind patterns, and the dynamics of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [Stramma and Schott, 1999].\nThe trade winds are the prevailing wind system on the tropics, being associated to the dynamics of the high pressure South Atlantic Anticyclone, blowing from East and Northeast during Spring and Summer (October to March), when the South Atlantic Anticyclone cell is displaced towards the South, and from Southeast during Autumn and Winter (April to September), when the anticyclone is in its Northernmost position [Nimer, 1989]. The ITCZ, changes its position seasonally, coming closer to the Eastern Brazilian Margin on Autumn and Summer; higher precipitation and weaker winds are regionally associated to the ITCZ. [Dominguez, 2004].\nThe results from a 32 years mean (1972-2004) of the global wind model reanalysis from the National Center of Environmental Prediction [NCEP, 2005] presented on Figure 3.6, reflects the regional wind field seasonality during the dry (August to February) and rain (March to July) periods. The wind on the regional Baia de Camamu zone blows preferably from East, during the dry period, with intensities varying from 2.7m.s-1 near the coast, increasing offshore and northwards to a mean intensity of 4.0m.s-1 (East of 38\u00b0W and North of 13\u00b0S). On the rain period, the wind blows preferably from the Southeast, with a similar spatial behavior but with about 14% less intensity than on the dry period. The mean intensities varied from about 2.3m.s-1 near the coast to 3.5m.s-1 East of 38\u00b0 W and North of 13\u00b0 S.\nFigure 3.6: Mean wind field on the regional vicinity of Baia de Camamu (14\u00b0S) and Baia de Todos os Santos (12.5\u00b0S), on the Eastern Brazilian Margin. On left, representation for the dry period (August to February) and on right, representation for the rain period (March to July). Results from a 32 years mean (1972-2004) of the global wind model reanalysis from the U.S. National Center of Environmental Prediction [NCEP, 2005]\noriginated on higher latitudes. On summer, the cold fronts tend to be weaker, have a lower pressure gradient, and a NE orientation, being deflected offshore and rarely crossing the tropics. On the other hand, during the winter the cold fronts may have a pronounced pressure gradient and reach latitudes lower than 10\u00b0S [Dominguez, 2004].\n3.3\tSampling strategy and methods\nThe dominant physical forcing driving the estuarine circulation and mixing are related to the tidal forcing on the ocean boundary, to freshwater discharge at the riverine interface and to gravitational circulation resultant from along-estuary gradients in density [O\u2019Callaghan et al., 2007]. Since Baia de Camamu presents a complex geometry and is influenced by many tributaries along its watershed, the establishment of a sampling strategy is not a trivial task. On one hand, the intention to evaluate its spatial variability demands a spatial and broad sampling effort. On the other hand, to keep the analysis as synoptical as possible and to cope with sampling limitations, a limited number of sites must be chosen.\nTo achieve a comprehensive but not extensive survey of CMB, the dynamical and hydrographic structure were sampled along two sampling periods, covering seasonal dry and rainy conditions. Across-channel transects lines were located at CMB major tributaries, at Ponta do Muta (the estuarine-shelf interface) and at Marau and Serinhaem channels (Figure 3.1). Based on this sampling strategy twelve semi-diurnal tidal cycles were monitored during the 2004 dry period (21st to 29th September) and the 2005 rainy period (20th to 29th July). Therefore, each channel was sampled on a neap and spring tidal regime, in each survey. Furthermore, along-system hydrographic profilers were conduced along the Maraue and Serinhaeem channels in order to evaluate the spatial structure and variability along neap and spring (Figure 3.1).\nThe dynamical structure was hourly profiled along the three transversal transects with a workhorse 600 kHz bottom-tracking acoustic doppler current meter profiler (ADCP) based on 1 m thick vertical cells. The vertical water properties (temperature, salinity and turbidity) were sampled with a SBE 19 plus seabird CTD profiler, with a vertical resolution of 25 cm and a frequency of 4 Hz. On the across-channel transect line, the CTD casts were positioned on two stations (Cast 1 and 2) located on both channel sides, symmetrical to the main channel axis (Figure 3.13 and 3.17). On the along-system hydrographic sampling, the casts were set along the channel main axis (Figure 3.1).\nTo better represents the hydrography the vertical profilers measurements were averaged at fixed stratum of non-dimensional depth [Miranda et al., 2002], since the stretching and contraction of the water column during a complete tidal cycle may cause distortions in the representation of the local depth. Turbidity readings were calibrated against Suspended Particulate Material (SPM) concentrations determined from ten triplicates of surface and bottom water samples collected along the Serinhaiem river longitudinal transect. All regressions were significant at the 95% confidence level with correlation coefficients (r2) of 0.9 and 0.84 for dry and rainy period, respectively.\nSea level oscillations are studied based on three data series obtained with a pressure sensor set on the borders of Marau channel, at the harbor of Companhia Baroid, at 13\u00b054,9' S; 39o00, 9' W, Figure 3.1: i) a dry period between 2002/12 and 2003/02; ii) a rainy period between 2003/05 and 2003/06 and iii) a larger period (2004/12 to 2006/01) covering one year of observations. Although these data series cover two dry and two rainy periods they are not simultaneous to the hydrographic campaigns. Wind time series were sampled simultaneous to sea level with a Wind Sentry RM Young anemograph located at the Marau Peninsula. The anemograph was set to operate at 10 hz, with a 15 minutes interval at a 18 m height platform. The data was post-processed to fit a 10m height wind level. Altogether, these represent the most extensive oceanographic data collecting effort ever conducted at CMB. The complete sampling map is depicted in figure 3.1.\n3.4\tSea level variability and the local wind.\nBala de Camamu is subject to microtidal regime on neap, with a maximum amplitude of 189 cm, and to mesotidal regime on spring, when the amplitude reaches a maximum of 266 cm (Table 3.1). Seasonally, the sea level height varies from a minimum of 80 (83) cm to a maximum of 213 (216) cm along the dry (rainy) periods. The longer period record reveals a sea-level variation from a minimum of 47 cm to a maximum of 266 cm presenting a difference of about 60% from the extreme values found on the previews series (Table 3.1). Such variability is of environmental relevance, determining the tidal wave excursion on the flooding zones which, in conjunction with topography and geomorphology, controls the mangrove colonization.\nTable 3.1: Minimum (Hmin) and maximum (Hmax) tidal amplitude at neap and spring tides. Data from the three tidal series, registered at Baroid company harbor, Baia de Camamu.\nSeries\tRecord Period\tNeap tide\t\tSpring tide\t\n\t\tHmin (cm)\tHmax (cm)\tHmin (cm)\tHmax (cm)\nDry\t2002/12/16 - 2003/02/03\t80\t188\t140\t213\nRainy\t2003/05/25 - 2003/06/24\t83\t158\t112\t216\nLonger\t2004/12/24 - 2006/01/18\t47\t189\t124\t266\nThe harmonic analysis of the large sea-level record was performed after Pawlow-icz et al. [2002] resulting in 67 tide components. Based on these components we found that 98% of the sea-level oscillations are forced by astronomical tides. The relative rate between the amplitudes of the main diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal components (Table 3.2) reveals a semi-diurnal tidal modulation dominance (Form number Fn=K1+O1/M2+S2=0.10 [Defant, 1960]).\nThe tidal prism is a proxy of the estuarine flushing capacity, being higher in meso-tidal than on micro-tidal estuarine systems [Miranda et al., 2002]. The tidal prism was estimated by integrating instantaneous volume transport from hourly current meter\nTable 3.2: Amplitude (A) and Greenwich phase (Gw\u00b0) of the main harmonic components obtained from the harmonic analysis of the one year sea-level register. The amplitude and phase error (e) are predicted with 95% confidence level.\nComponent\tA \u00b1 6 (cm)\tGw \u00b1 6 (o)\nOi\t6.32 \u00b1 0.22\t130.73 \u00b1 2.22\nKi\t3.89 \u00b1 0.24\t217.03 \u00b1 3.29\nM2\t74.69 \u00b1 0.45\t117.40 \u00b1 0.32\nS2\t27.77 \u00b1 0.41\t136.15 \u00b1 0.89\nsections, along the flooding tide period of 6.5 h. As one would expect, the tidal prism is considerably higher on spring than on neap, being almost three times larger on the Marau and approximately double on the Serinhaem (Table 3.3), denoting the high flushing variability between spring and neap. Furthermore, the tidal prism is about 30% larger at Marau (145.2x106.m -3), than at Serinhaem (112x106.m-3) at spring, and about 7% lower on the Marau (55.0x106.m- 3 than at the Serinhaem (59.2x106.m- 3) at neap.\nTable 3.3: Tidal prism estimative at Serinhaem and Marau channels.

This behavior suggests that Baaa de Camamu may work as a sediment exporter (importer) during neap (spring) periods, when the tidal heights are typically lower (higher).\nFigure 3.7: Tidal asymmetry based on the rate between the flood time (TF) and the ebb time (TE) calculated from the sea-level records obtained at Baroid company harbor (Table 3.1).\nThe estuarine residence time is closely connected to the estuarine sub-inertial circulation. Residual sea-level oscillations is one of the main mechanisms to control the sub-inertial circulation and have a close relationship with the variations in the wind orientation which reflects on the local and remote wind forcing. The local wind forcing is associated to the zonal component of the wind being as higher as the alignment with the main channel while the remote wind forcing is a response to the Ekman transport dynamics caused by downwelling/upwelling favorable winds. These changes reflect the need to evaluate the seasonal wind variations [Janzen and Wong, 2002].\nIn order to evaluate the sub-inertial wind forcing sea level variability inside the CMB, the wind components (zonal and meridional) and the tidal series were low-pass filtered with the digital filter proposed by Walters and Heston [1982]. The cut-off period adopted is the local inertial frequency, which, based on the relation Tf = 2n/f where f is the local Coriolis parameter, corresponds to 50 hours. The sub-inertial CMB sea level oscillations presented a in-phase correlation with the meridional wind forcing (remote effect) for both dry and wet periods which implies that an upwelling (downwelling) favorable wind causes a decrease (increase) in the sea level, in agreement with coastal Ekman dynamics (Figure 3.4). Also, the zonal wind forcing (local effect) presents a seasonal influence on the CMB sea-level oscillations. During the dry period the zonal wind were preferentially onshore and opposed the direction of the estuarine circulation, resulting in a sea level rise (Figure 3.4 left panel). Such behavior was not observed during the wet period, when the zonal wind were preferentially off-shore (Figure 3.4 right panel). The longer sub-inertial sealevel series however (Figure 3.4 bottom panel) shows a succession of upper and lower sea level heights along the year, suggesting that other physical forcing may also be relevant on the sub-inertial sea level variabilities along the period.\nDRY PERIOD\nRAIN PERIOD\n2003\n2004\t2005\nFigure 3.8: Wind time-series, sub-inertial zonal and meridional wind components and sub-inertial non-tidal sea level oscillations at Baroid company harbor during the dry (2002/12-2003/02) and the rain (2003/05-2003/06) periods. The bottom panel represents the one year record (2004/12-2006/01) sub-inertial non-tidal sea level oscillations. Wind positive values are northward and off-shore.\n3.5\tAn evaluation of the dry and rainy conditions concurrent the sampling surveys.\nDaily pluviometric results and concurrent daily discharge distribution from the Itubera station along the survey period months are presented in Figure 3.9. The dry period survey covers the September 2004 data, presented on the left while the rainy period survey covers the July 2005 data, presented on the right. These results are a proxy for the pluviometric: and runoff conditions along CMB over the survey periods.\nmonthly day\tmonthly day\nFigure 3.9: Pluviometric (top panels) and fluviometric (bottom panels) daily distribution at Ituberaa stations concurrent the survey periods. The dotted lines delimits the sampling periods.\nprecipitation distribution reveals a persistent rainfall during both survey periods, but distinct nature between them. In September 2004, a low precipitation (maximum of 4 mm) marked the dry survey period while most of the monthly precipitation occurred out of the sampling period. On july 2005 however, the total monthly precipitation of 238 mm was about 28% higher than the climatological mean value and an anomalous high precipitation of 70 mm, which represents almost 30% of the monthly total, was registered for the second sampling day.\nAs expected, the Cachoeira Grande discharge was directly influenced by the precipitation (Figure 3.9, bottom panels). During September 2004, the monthly discharge of\n4.6\tm3 s-1 was below the climatological value of 5.8 m3 s-1. The mean discharge over the dry survey period was 4.2 m3 s-1. During July 2005, an extreme condition was registered. Despite the fact that the monthly mean discharge of 6.7 m3 s-1 represents the climatological value, a high mean discharge of 9.5 m3 s-1 was registered for the survey period and a extreme discharge of 10.8 m3 s-1 occurred in the fourth day. The dry period survey discharge correspond to 50% time permanence for the Cachoeira Grande while the rain period amount corresponds to 8% permanence (Figure 3.5). Therefore, in seasonal terms, we may infer that the September 2004 survey was performed under typical dry condition while the July 2005 survey was performed under extreme rainy conditions.\n3.6\tHydrography and flow patterns at Baia de Camamu main channels.\nThis section presents field results from the most prominent Baea de Camamu channels (Marau and Serinhaem) and at Ponta do Mute (at the bay mouth) during a typical dry condition (September 2004) and on an extreme rainy condition (July 2005). The objective is to characterize the hydrographical and dynamical structure over the sampling periods. The results are presented and discussed in this order.\n3.6.1\tSeptember 2004 - Dry period, low discharge event.\nThe along-channel hydrographic and SPM distributions remarks the marine influence over the Maraue and Serinhaeem channels in September 2004, dry period survey (Figure 3.10). On the Maraeu, salinity higher than 30 persists for over 25 km towards the inner channel, on either spring (not shown) or neap (Figure 3.10, left). The water column stratification was weak, being always lower than 1. The spatial salinity gradient was similar on neap and spring, with a maximum of 35 and a minimum of 25 (neap) or 24 (spring). On the Serinhaeem channel however (Figure 3.10, right panel), salinity higher than 30 persists for about 10 km, while a marked horizontal gradient of 13.8 (32.8 - 19) occurs towards the innermost channel during the spring tidal period. The vertical salinity stratification was slightly higher in the Serinhaeem than in the Maraeu but the differences are not sound.\nFigure 3.10: Along-channel vertical distribution for Salinity, Temperature and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) along Marau (left panels) and Serinhaem (right panels) channels during the September 2004 (dry period) survey. Neap low tide and spring high tide, respectively.

Ebb and flood flow presents maximum intensity on surface, gradually decreasing towards the bottom, where friction is stronger. This pattern is recurrent in every channel and in all tidal periods, except for the flood Serinhaeem flow during spring tide, where a maximum mid-depth intensity of -0.6 m s-1 is found (Figure 3.12).\nThe mean across-channel ebb flow ranges from 0.26 m s-1 to 0.38 m s-1 during neap and from 0.78 m s-1 to 0.83 cm s-1 during spring tides. The maximum ebb transport of 26,631 m3 s-1 is observed at Ponta do Muta during spring while the minimum ebb\ntransport of 4,492 m3 s-1 is observed at the Serinhaem during neap (Table 3.4). On flood, the mean across-channel intensities ranges from -0.28 m s-1 to -0.32 m s-1 in neap and, from -0.51 m s-1 to -0.72 m s-1 in spring. Maximum flood transport of -22,024 m3 s-1 occurs at Ponta do Mute during spring while a minimum flood transport of -4,091 m3 s-1 is observed at the Marau channel, in neap (Table 3.4).\nFlow reversion shows different patterns in neap and spring tidal periods. At Ponta do Mute and Marau, the neap bottom currents began to reverse before the surface flow while on spring, the surface flow reverses first. The opposite is observed at the Serinhaem channel for spring and neap tides.\nThe residual flow at Ponta do Mute is upstream in the central and deeper channel and downstream along the upper margins during both neap and spring tides, being associated with a residual flood transport of -90 m3 s-1 for neap and -977 m3 s-1 for spring tidal period (Figure 3.13 and Table 3.4). In the Marau and Serinhaem channels, the flow structure for neap is mainly downstream, except for a reversal close to the bottom, being associated with a ebb residual transport of 502 m3 s-1 and 35 m3 s-1, respectively. On spring tide however a two layer residual pattern is noticeable for both channels, while the residual transport is upstream at the Marau, associated with a flood transport of -221 m3 s-1, and downstream at the Serinhaem, associated with a ebb transport of +329 m3 s-1 (Figure 3.13 and Table 3.4).\nFigure 3.11: Hourly vertical structure for flow intensities (left) and salinity (right) during a dry period neap tide survey at Ponta do Muta (top panels), Marau (middle panels) and Serinhaem (bottom panels) channels. CTD cast 1 are represented for Ponta do Muta and Marau and CTD cast 2 at the Serinhaem channel. HT and LT represents high and low tidal times.\nFigure 3.12: Hourly vertical structure for flow intensities (left) and salinity (right) during a dry period spring tide survey at Ponta do Mutia (top panels), Maraui (middle panels) and Serinhaiem (bottom panels) channels. Above, CTD cast 1 are represented for Ponta do Muta and Marau and CTD cast 2 at the Serinhaem channel. HT and LT represents high and low tidal times.\nThe asymmetry between ebb and flood is very pronounced on the Serinhaem during spring tides. The flood flow presented a maximum intensity of -0.70 m s-1 and an associated transport of -7,279 m3.s-1 while the ebb flow reached 1.2 m s-1 and transport of 10,225 m3.s-1. The ebb residual flow of +329 m3 s-1 may reflects the along-channel salinity gradient.\nThe vertical salinity structure varies significantly between neap and spring tidal periods, as well as, between the channels (Figures 3.11 and 3.12 right panels). The water advected toward the bay during the flood tend to occupy all the water column during the high tide, for both neap and spring tides, when the surface salinity reach its maximum value (Figures 3.11 and 3.12 right panels). During the neap tide, the whole water column presented salinity > 36.6 during flood tide. Minimum surface salinity of\n28.8\toccurs at Serinhaem during ebb tides. During the spring tide the salinity reach a maximum of 37 near the bottom at the Marau in the high tide, and a minimum surface value of 31.5 at the Serinhaem low tide (Figures 3.11 and 3.12 right panels).\nTable 3.4: Mean across-channel velocity and transport at Barra do Muta, Marau and Serinhaem channels during the dry survey, on neap (N) and spring (S) tides.

On the other hand, at the Maraeu channel the opposite is observed. A moderate stratified structure occurs during the high tide, with a maximum vertical gradient of 0.5 (35.9 - 36.4), while during the low tide a quasi homogeneous structure is observed. The Serinhaeem channel shows a high stratified structure along most of the monitored period. Maximum vertical gradients and low salinity is observed at low tides with an extreme value of 4.6 (30 - 34.6). At high tide however, a moderate stratified structure is observed, with a maximum salinity of 34.8 near the bottom (Figures 3.11 right panels).\nAt spring tide, a similar behavior is observed for the Ponta do Mutea and Maraeu channels. On higher flood and ebb tides a mixed structure is formed, while, a moderate stratified structure occurs on high and low tides. Maximum vertical gradient at Ponta do Muta occurs during high (36.4 - 36.8) and low (35.4 - 35.8) tide, and during the high tide (36.4 - 37.0) at Marau channel. A extreme salinity variation of 4.8 is observed at Serinhaem channel during the spring tide. Maximum salinity value of 36.4 is observed near the bottom during the high tide and the minimum value of 31.6 occur at the surface during the low tide when a maximum vertical gradient of 0.8 (31.6 - 32.4) is observed.\nFigure 3.13: Residual flow structure over a complete semi-diurnal tidal cycle (13 h) at the Ponta do Muta (top panels), Marau (middle panels) and Serinhaem (bottom panels) across-channel transects along the dry period survey.

The along-system salinity distribution shows a marked spatial variation. The gradient is maximum on neap tide, varying from 10 to 34 on the Marau (not shown) and from 12 to 31 at the at the Serinhaem (Figure 3.14, right).\nFigure 3.14: Along-channel vertical distribution for Salinity, Temperature and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) along Marau (left panels) and Serinhaem (right panels) channels during the July 2005 (rain period) survey. Spring high tide and neap low tide respectively. Distance are from the channel mouth and dots represents the CTD casts position (Figure 3.1).\nAlthough the variation is larger on the Maraue, the Serinhaeem channel presented salinity lower than 30 and a marked vertical stratification along most of its extension while on the Maraeu, a more homogeneous vertical structure is found. On Spring, the along-channel salinity gradient was lower, being of 14.2 (from 22 to 36.2) at the Marau, Figure 3.14 and 15 (from 19 to 34) at the Serinhaem (not shown). The vertical salinity structure is well mixed at the inner Maraue and moderate stratified at the first 20 km, with a maximum vertical variation of 3(32-35); Vertical Serinhaem variations are more homogeneous, being less than 1 (not shown).\nSlightly higher temperature values are found on the inner stations (values of 25.9\u00b0C on Marau and 27\u00b0C on Serinhaem). Vertical stratification is marked along the Serinhaem, but the gradient is seldom higher than 0.4\u00b0C. On the Marae, the vertical gradient is lower. A well marked zone of maximum turbidity is observed on either mid channels in Spring. The SPM reaches 25mg l-1 at the Serinhaem (not shown) and 10 mg l-1 at the Marau the (Figure 3.14, bottom). High SPM values, around 20mg l-1 are also found at the channels entrance.\nDuring the neap period the salinity reaches a maximum value of 36.2 near the bottom at Ponta do Mute (Figure 3.15 top right panel) and the vertical salinity structure at this location varies between a complete mixed to a moderate stratified, when a maximum vertical gradient of 1.6 (33 - 34.6) at the low tide is observed. Vertical salinity structures at Maraue and Serinhaeem channels are high stratified during neap tide (Figure 3.15 middle and bottom right panel). Maximum values occurred during the high tides and occupies almost the entire water column, reaching 31 at the Serinhaeem and\n35.2\tat the Marau, where a vertical gradient of 5.2 (30 - 35.2) is observed. During the low tides minimum salinity values of 25 and 28.8 are observed at these locations, when can be observed vertical gradients of 6 (24.8 - 30.8) and 5.8 (28.8 - 34.6), at the Serinhaeem and Maraue channels, respectively.\nDuring the spring tides the salinity vertical structures at the Maraue and Serinhaeem are well mixed with slightly stratification during high tides (Figure 3.16 middle and bottom right panels). At MaraU maximum salinity of 35.8 is observed near the bottom during the high tide, while, a minimum value of 31.1 occur in the low tide. Maximum vertical gradient of 2.2 (31.6 - 33.8) at this location is observed during the maximum ebb velocities. The minimum salinity value of 25.6 observed during the spring tide occur at the low tide in the Serinhaeem channel. The vertical salinity structure is well mixed, but in the high tide when a weak gradient (33 - 34) and the maximum salinity is observed. A different behavior is observed at Ponta do Muta, where the vertical salinity structure is mainly moderate stratified (Figure 3.16 top right panel). Maximum vertical gradients of 1.5 (33.7 - 35.2) and 1.2 (32.8 - 34) occur, respectively, during the higher flood and ebb velocities, and the maximum salinity of 36.4 occur during the high tide, occupying almost all the water column.\nThe flow dynamics during a complete tidal cycle show a similar behavior than those observed during the dry period. Instantaneous ebb and flood velocities present a surface maximum decreasing toward the bottom at the three transversal transects monitored, during the neap and spring tides (Figures 3.15 and 3.16 left panels). Maximum velocities are observed during the ebbs, reaching 0.7 m s-1 at Barra do Muta on neap tide and 1.2 m s-1 at Marau on spring tide, where a vertical shear of 1.0 m s-1 is observed. During the floods the maximum velocities of -0.6 m s-1 and -1.2 m s-1 are observed at Barra do Mutaa on neap and at Maraau on spring tide, respectively.\nFigure 3.15: Hourly vertical structure for flow intensities (left) and salinity (right) during the rain period neap tide survey at Ponta do Mutea (top panels), Maraeu (middle panels) and Serinhaeem (bottom panels) channels. CTD cast 1 are represented for Ponta do Muta and Marae, and CTD cast 2 at the Serinhaem channel.

CTD cast 1 are represented for Ponta do Mutaa and Maraua and CTD cast 2 at the Serinhaaem channel. HT and LT represents high and low tidal times.\nThe residual velocities at Ponta do Muta are mainly flood oriented and concentrates at the central part of the channel during neap and spring tides, with residual transports of -215 m3 s-1 and -54 m3 s-1, at spring and neap respectively (Figure 3.17 and Table 3.5). The residual flow at Marau and Serinhaem channels have a two layer structure at either neap and spring, being mostly ebb oriented in the first 5 m of the water column and flood from there to the bottom. On the spring tide, the flood residual flow tended to be concentrated on the middle part of the channels (Figure 3.17. A low residual transport of 21 m3 s-1 is ebb oriented at the Serinhaeem channel, while on the remaining channels, the residual was flood oriented, at either spring or neap tides.\nTable 3.5: Mean across-channel velocity and transport at Barra do Muta, MaraU and Serinhaem channels during the rain survey on neap (N) and spring (S) tides.

Such variability determines the tidal wave excursion on the flooding zones and a high flushing variability, being of relevance to the mangrove colonization, sediment dynamics and to water quality within the system (section 3.4).\nTo evaluate the spatial variability of the complex CMB estuarine system, its dynamical and hydrographic structure were surveyed along the main channels, covering September (2004) and July (2005) conditions. Basing on the pluviometric and fluviometric data concurrent the survey period (section 3.5) and on the regional pluviometric (section 3.2.2) and fluviometric (section 3.2.3) regimes, we found that September (2004) survey was performed under typical dry pluviometric condition while the July (2005) survey occurred under extreme rainy conditions. By using the Cachoeira Grande fluviometric regime as reference (section 3.2.3), the dry period survey discharge correspond to 50% time flow permanence while the rainy period amount corresponds to 8% time flow permanence (section 3.5), denoting to be an extreme event.\nThe along system hydrographic structure remarks the strong marine influence along the September, 2004, dry period survey (section 3.6.1) or alternatively, a distinguished runoff signature, prevalent on the July 2005, rainy survey (section 3.6.2). In September 2004, salinity higher than 30 persists for over 25 km towards the inner Marauu channel, the water column stratification is weak and the spatial salinity gradient was similar on neap and spring tides, with a maximum of 35 and a minimum of 24 in spring (section 3.6.1). In july 2005, the Marau along-system salinity distribution shows a marked spatial variation and the gradient reaches a maximum of 24 (from 10 to 34) in neap, although a nearly homogeneous vertical structure remains. In Spring, the along-channel salinity gradient of 14.2 (from 22 to 36.2) is found along the Marau channel (section\n3.6.2).\nIn the Serinhaem, salinity higher than 30 persists for about 10 km in September 2004, although a gradient of 13.8 (19 - 32.8) occurs towards the innermost channel during the spring tidal period (section 3.6.1). In the July 2005, the Serinhaem channel presented salinity lower than 30 and a marked vertical stratification along most of its extension. The spatial gradient reaches a maximum of 19 (12 to 31) in neap. In spring, the along-channel salinity gradient was lower, being of 15 (19 to 34) at the Serinhaem (section 3.6.2).\nOne of the most accepted classification of estuary systems is based on the Hansen and Rattray\u2019s stratification and circulation diagram [Hansen and Rattray, 1966] that allows the characterization of an estuary based on non-dimensional parameters, related to the salinity (stratification) and dynamical (circulation) structure.\nBy considering the Hansen and Rattray\u2019s diagram, the Serinhaem channel may be classified as partially mixed in most of the September 2004 (red dots) and July 2005 (blue dots) conditions (Figure 3.18). Partially mixed estuaries have a tidal energy that provides a means of compensating the stratification, raising the salt wedge. The salt water is mixed upward and fresh water is mixed downward. Exceptions for this behavior are found on the right (deeper) side of the channel under neap, along the rain period (CTD Cast 2 or blue square) or, at the left (shallower) side of the channel under spring, along the dry period (CTD cast 1 or red crossed circle), when the system behaves as well-mixed estuary (Figure 3.18 and Figure 3.17, for the CTD cast location).\nSerinha\u00e9m\n10\n10\no\nw\nw\nE 10\n\u25a1)\nV)\n10~2\n10\u20193\nUs/Uo\nBarra do Muta\n10\n10\n10\n10\nUs/Uo\n102\n103\no W w\nE 10 \u25a1)\nm\n10~2\n10-3\n10'\n\t\t\\\tEHHfi\t\t\t\t\n\t1b\t\t2b\t\t3b\t\n\t\t\t\u00d3-.\t\u25a1 ,\t0.01\t\t\n\t1a\t\t2a\t.\t\t\t3a\n\t\u25a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\to\t\t\t\t\n\t\tn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t1.0\t\t\t\t\n\t\u25a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUs/Uo\nFigure 3.18: Hansen and Rattray\u2019s stratification and circulation diagram for Serinhaem, Marau and Barra do Muta channels. CTD casts 1 (2) represented as circle (square); neap (spring) tides as empty (cross) dots; rain (dry) sampling as blue (red) dots.\nWell-mixed estuaries are found when either tidal forcing or water runoff are effective in promoting mixing on the water column, so that the salinity tends to be vertically homogeneous and decreases from the ocean to the river, along the channel. The net flow is weak and tends to be seaward. On the rain period, neap conditions, the net transport was seaward, at 21 m3s-1 (Table 3.5) while on the dry period spring conditions, the net transport was seawards, at 325 m3s-1 (Table 3.4). In the first case, the system is type 1b, while on the second is type 1a, denoting a higher stratification on the rain survey.\nThe spatial dynamical variance on both cases with the left (right) channel side be\ning partially mixed along rain (dry) conditions, while the right (left) being vertically homogeneous reflects the bathymetric differences along the Serinhaem channel and, the effectiveness of turbulence, associated to higher discharge, in promoting mixture along the channel. The Serinhaem only gets vertically homogeneous at its deeper channel due to the increase of discharge at the rain period, being spatially non-homogeneous.\nOn the Marau channel, the Hansen and Rattray\u2019s diagram points to vertically homogeneous conditions over spring tides and partially mixed conditions over neap (Figure 3.18). Exception to this pattern is the partially mixed condition found on the left channel side (CTD cast 1 or blue crossed circle) at the rain July (2005) survey . The Maraeu presented lower stratification than the Serinhaeem channel with the most stratified conditions occurring on the rain survey and neap tides (blue empty dots). The dry survey (red dots) presented conditions vertically and laterally more homogeneous than the rain period, being located on the lower left part of the diagram (Figure 3.18). The net transport was seaward on the dry period neap (502 m3s-1) and, landward on the remaining sampling periods. The Flood transport estimative however was larger than the Ebb transport in every sampling period (Table 3.4 and 3.5).\nPonta do Muta, at the Bay entrance presents a ~6400 m wide entrance channel being around 15 m deep on its eastern and deeper side. On its western portion the topography is very irregular with depths as low as 3 m. The Hansen and Rattray\u2019s diagram classifies this channel, at most of the sampling conditions, as vertically homogeneous (Figure 3.18). Considering the relatively large channel length, it does not shows large horizontal variability (Figure 3.18). The Flood transport estimative was larger than the Ebb transport for most of the time (except on neap, on the dry period), reaching values as high as 26,631 m3s-1 on the spring dry survey (Table 3.4). Our estimative of residual flow is upwards in all monitored conditions, varying from -54 m3s-1 (Table 3.5) at July (2005) spring to -977 m3s-1 at September (2004) spring (Table 3.4).\n3.8\tConcluding remarks\nIn this work we summarized the regional physical setting and investigated the inner Baia de Camamu hydrographic and flow dynamics along two distinctive sampling periods, covering Sept. (2004) and July (2005), dry and rainy condition, respectively. By using the available fluviometric data as reference, we estimated the dry period discharge to correspond to 50% time flow permanence while the rainy period discharge corresponds to 8% time flow permanence, suggesting to be an extreme event.\nThis sampling effort has provided the first insight on Baia de Camamu structure and variability. The along system hydrographic structure remarks the strong marine influence along the September (2004) dry survey or alternatively, a distinguished runoff signature, prevalent on the July (2005) rainy survey, depicting the intense temporal variability of inner Baia de Camamu due to high variable discharge conditions.\nThe hydrodynamical structure is large depended on the freshwater inputs as well as on the tidal wave characteristics. For instance, the Serinhaem channel behaves mostly as a partially mixed system, only getting well mixed at its deeper channel side due to the freshwater discharge at the rain period or alternatively, to spring tidal forcing on the shallower side, on the dry period. On the Marau, the tidal wave influence is evident. Vertically homogeneous conditions are prevalent over spring tides while partially mixed conditions are prevalent over neap tides. Lower stratification are prevalent on the Marau than on the Serinhaem. Ponta do Muta, at the bay mouth behaves mostly as a vertically homogeneous system and does not shows large horizontal variability, considering its relatively large length.\nTherefore, besides the intense temporal variability related to the high variable discharge, Baia de Camamu also depicted a very marked spatial variability, evident on the distinguished dynamical character found for Marau,, Serinhaem and Ponta do Muta channels.\n3.9\tAppendix: Basin discharge estimate based on instantaneous point sources, soil composition and relative sub-basin areas.\nTypical Ba\u00eda de Camamu inflow values were estimated from the Cachoeira Grande discharge series data and from instantaneous runoff values, collected at point sources distributed around the drainage area (Figure 3.2) on Feb. 13 and 19, 2000 CRA [2000]. The point sources included river Cachoeira Grande and smaller tributaries such as the Jatiman, Piabas and Cachoeira do Barro, at the Serinha\u00e9m sub-basin and river Igrapi\u00fana, at CMB central sub-basin (Table 3.6).\nTable 3.6: Point source discharge and time permanence along Baea de Camamu drainage basin . The time prevalence for each point source was estimated by correlation with the Ituberu flow permanence curve (Figure 3.5), defining the local permanence coefficient, K=Qgo(Itubera)/Qgo(local). Reference discharge was monitored on Feb., 13 and Feb., 19 of 2000.\nPoint Source\tDischarge (m3.s-1)\tDate (Feb, 2000)\tTime Preval.

The local discharge estimative, Qn, is thus the result of the product between K and the local discharge value (Qn = K * Qlocal), for any given period. On the Cachoeira grande, the runoff of 5.24 m3.s-1 and 5.00 m3.s-1 , corre-\nsponds to a flow permanence of 48% and 49% respectively, while the discharge with 90% time permanence corresponds to 2.10 m3.s-1 (Section 3.2.3).\nSpecific discharge was estimated by considering the type of soil on every sub-basin area (Figure 3.19). For instance, an area covered by clay soils may have an specific discharge 50% larger than an area covered by latosol. The latosol zones however were typically larger than the clay soil zones and an adjustment curve, relating the area and runoff distribution on those zones was also established (Figure 3.20).\nFigure 3.19: Soil sectorization of Baia de Camamu major tributaries basin, based on SRH [2003] geographic database. On map is also represented the Itubera fluviometric station[ANA, 2009] and the runoff point sources, used to estimate the total discharge.\nBy following this methodology, the mean discharge at each Camamu sub-basin, was estimated as a composition of the runoff estimative (related to the reference station), soil composition and relative drainage area sizes (Table 3.7). The mean discharge at the Serinhaem basin is estimated at 18.1 m3.s-1 on the rain period, which is about 9% larger than the dry period discharge of 16.5 m3.s-1 (Table 3.7). At the central bay zone, the total discharge on the rain period sums 25.5 m3.s-1, against 23.3 m3.s-1 on the dry period. On this zone, the largest contribution comes from the Sorojo, that drains an area of 392.30 km2 (about 70% of the drainage), 84% over latosol and have an estimated discharge of 12.6 m3.s-1 on the dry period and 13.7 m3.s-1 on the rain period (Table 3.7).\nThe Marau, at the south bay zone, presents mean discharge of 11.20 m3.s-1 on the dry period and, 12.1 m3.s-1 on the rain period (Table 3.7). On this sub-basin, the clay soil zones, that covers about 14% of the total drainage basin are responsible for about 49% of the total runoff (Mean of 5.5 m3.s-1 for the dry period and, 6.06 m3.s-1 on the rain (Table 3.7). Finally, the total CMB discharge was estimated on 51 m3.s-1 on the dry period and, 55.7 m3.s-1 for the rain period. These are conservative values but establishes a reference for the seasonal Baia de Camamu inflow.\nTable 3.7: Seasonal mean runoff for the main Baua de Camamu tributaries.

The model, which is configured from the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS), a three dimensional community model designed for coastal applications [Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005], has two separated one-way off-line nested domains with resolution of ~ 3km and ~ 1km in the horizontal direction and 30 vertical sigma levels, comprising the coastal and estuarine systems in the zone between the cities of Salvador and Ilh\u00e9us and higher resolution focus on Baia de Camamu(Figure 4.1).\ntidally driven and not varying significantly seasonally or Barroso Junior [2009] that suggests a methodology for prognostic tidal current charts, using Baia de Todos os Santos as a case study. Baia de Camamu, the second largest EBM embayment system was first investigated on a data analysis basis, in Chapter 3, revealing to be subject to micro tidal regime on neap and to meso tidal on spring. Such variability determines the tidal wave excursion on the flooding zones and a high flushing variability, being of relevance to the mangrove colonization, sediment dynamics and to the water quality within the system. On the Southern EBM, Pereira et al. [2005] applied a three dimensional model, suggesting that tidal currents and steep topography may enhance upwelling, increasing local primary productivity on the zone around the Abrolhos bank.\nIn many predictive tidal surface applications two dimensional models have traditionally been applied, giving adequate results. But, due to the much smaller scale variability of tidal currents, in comparison to tidal elevations, tidal currents studies over shelf and near coastal zones invokes a three dimension tidal model implementation [Prandle,\n1997]. Recent applications of ROMS with this purpose includes Marta-Almeida and Dubert [2006] and Wang et al. [2008].\nIn the present study, the model tidal response is compared against short period tidal gauge data from stations along the EBM and to one year long Baeia de Camamu pressure sensor data. The primary objective is to evaluate the model response by using a simple configuration (that considers constant bottom stress and homogeneous hydrographic conditions) and to investigate the nature of the barotropic tidal propagation along different spatial scales on the Eastern Brazilian Margin and towards inner Baia de Camamu. Secondly, its discussed the paths to follow in order to establish a realistic coastal modeling system that allows estuarine connections and some work science hypotheses to follow.\n4.2\tModel setting\nA nested general oceanic model was configured for the Eastern Brazilian Margin, with the objective of establishing a model view of the lesser investigated regional mesoscale dynamics, retaining on the solution the connections from the large-scale circulation (Chapter 2). In the current experiment, a third (L2) and fourth (L3) level was set in the previous configuration to investigate the tidal propagation along different spatial scales and towards more realistic and shallower bathymetry on the shelf, near shore and estuarine inner-bay system. The oceanic general circulation model used is ROMS, a free surface, s-coordinates, hydrostatic, community model designed for coastal applications [Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005].\nThe nesting of the model domains is accomplished through the Adaptive Grid Refinement in Fortran (AGRIF), which is based on the use of pointers to successively address the variables of the different grids, keeping most of the original code unchanged (Debreu et al. [2008], Blayo and Debreu [1999]). ROMS AGRIF provides a continuous transition from the coarse resolution to the fine resolution solution [Penven et al., 2006]. As described in Chapter 2, the nesting between L0 and L1 is online and one-way, which allows the two grids to run simultaneously with the coarse-resolution domain providing the boundary conditions to the finer-resolution domain and not backwards. In contrast, the nesting down-scale to L2 and L3 is one-way and off-line, stoping and restarting the nested domains at a fixed time interval.\nmodeling technique [Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002] and presents a 1/4\u00b0 resolution for the South Atlantic. The tidal-permitting grid domains (grids L2 and L3) are presented in Figure 4.1.\nFigure 4.1: The modeling system, focusing on the off-line nesting, tidal-permitting domain (grids L2 and L3). The position for the tidal station of Garcia d\u2019Avila (T1), Porto de Salvador (T2), Ba\u00eda de Camamu (T3), Porto de Ilh\u00e9us (T4), Canavieiras (T5) and the sites of Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo and Ilha de Itaparica are indicated on grid L2. The complete grid system with the online and offline nesting framework is depicted in Figure 1.1.\nThe L2 grid covers the middle EBM, from the latitudes of 12\u00b0 to 15\u00b0S and the longitudes of 36.5\u00b0 to 39.5\u00b0W, covering the coastal zone from North of Salvador to Ilh\u00e9us, while the finest-resolution L3 grid, focuses on the inner Ba\u00e9a de Camamu and its connection with the coastal ocean, from 13.5\u00b0 to 14.3\u00b0S and from 38.3\u00b0 to 39.3\u00b0W. L2 resolution is of ~ 3 km consisting of 107 by 148 grid points and L3 resolution is of ~ 1 km, consisting of 315 by 261 grid points. All domains have 30 vertical levels following the bottom topography, with Qs = 4.0 and = 0.4, indicating increased resolution in surface and bottom [Song and Haidvogel, 1994].\nGrid topography, derived from ETOPO1, a 1 arc-minute global relief model of\nEarth\u2019s surface [Amante and Eakins, 2009] was merged with locally surveyed data for the near shelf and, inner Baia de Camamu. The bathymetric data was smoothed using a hanning filter, ensuring the bathymetric gradient fits to a maximum slope factor (r = Vh/h = 0.2), which is an empirical criterion to compute pressure gradient force accurately [Beckman and Haidvogel, 1993]. In this experiment, a linear bottom friction parametrization (rb =rub, where ub stands for the velocity on the bottom level) with a typical bottom drag coefficient of r= 3.0 x 10-4m.s-1 was applied. A nonlocal, K-profile planetary (KPP) boundary layer scheme [Large et al., 1994] parameterizes the vertical mixing processes.

[2002] to retrieve short period tidal harmonic components (M2, S2, K1, O1) on every grid points.\n4.3\tTidal data\nExcept for Ba\u00eda de Camamu, the tidal data used for comparison are mostly published harmonic analysis from Salles et al. [2000]. These data, mainly used for navigation purposes, were obtained from short period tidal gauge series from the tidal station of Garcia d\u2019Avila, from 12/06/62 to 13/07/62 (T1), Porto de Salvador, from 01/01/60 to 23/12/60 (T2), Porto de Ilh\u00e9us, from 10/11/76 to 11/12/76 (T4) and Canavieiras, from 01/01/55 to 31/12/55 (T5). Dates are indicated in the format DD/MM/YY. The Ba\u00eda de Camamu (T3) data used is the one year pressure sensor series discussed on Chapter\n3.\tThe tidal stations geographical reference is indicated in Figure 4.1.\n4.4\tResults\nThe amplitude and co-phase charts of the modelled M2 and 01 are presented in Figure\n4.2.\tFor both constituents we observe an equatorward signal propagation (clearer on the 01), with increased amplitudes on the coastal systems of Baia de Camamu and Baia de Todos os Santos. The S2 and K1 (not shown) show similar spatial pattern to the M2 and 01 respectively, but smaller amplitudes.\nFigure 4.2: Amplitude (m) and Greenwich phases (G\u00b0) charts of the modeled M2 (left) and 0i (right) constituents along the central zone of the Eastern Brazilian Margin (L2 grid).\nThe comparison of the model amplitude (cm) and Greenwich phases (G\u00b0) with the data from five tidal stations (see Figure 4.1 for location) are presented in Table 4.2. The computed values were obtained from the closest grid points to the tidal stations.\nTable 4.2: Observed and Modeled tidal amplitude (cm) and Greenwich phases (G\u00b0) for Garcia D\u2019Avila, Porto de Salvador, Ba\u00eda de Camamu, Porto de ilh\u00e9us and Canavieras (Figure 4.1).

Among the other major constituents analyzed, the largest and lowest amplitude discrepancies are found for the K1 and O1 along the three coastal stations. The mean amplitude ratio between M2 (O1) is of 10.2, being lowest (9.4) within Baia de Camamu.\nComparison in terms of Greenwich phases, denotes a good response for most constituents and stations. Discrepancies lower than 20\u00b0 are found for the M2 in every station and for the K1 along four tidal stations (Porto de Salvador, Baia de Camamu, Porto de ilheus and Canavieras). Nevertheless, relatively high phase discrepancy are found for the S2 constituent along the stations. By comparison, Pereira et al. [2005] modelling a region south of our domain but using some common data (Canavieras and Porto de Ilheus), presents model results with considerable higher phase discrepancies.\nTherefore, regarding the quantitative amplitude and phase response , the model reproduces the observed values reasonably well. The differences found, may be ascribed to many factors, as to the differences in position and depth between the model and the tidal station (the model results being for the closest grid point); to the usage of a linear and constant drag coefficient; to the usage of minimum model depth of 2 m within Baia de Camamu (by the lack of bathymetric data in some zones) or, to inaccuracies in the prescribed free surface elevations along the boundaries. Adjustment to the boundary forcing elevation are pointed by Pereira et al. [2005] as a way of improving phase discrepancies. Considering all these possible interferences, our model response is quite robust.\nRegional barotropic tidal current ellipses are depicted for M2, S2, K1 and O1 constituents in Figure 4.3. Tidal ellipses over oceanic regions are weak for all four constituents, with typical values around of 1.5 cm-1 for M2 and, 0.5 cm-1 for the O1. The ellipses presents a predominant clockwise rotation for the M2 constituent and counterclockwise rotation for the remaining.\nOver the shelf zones the tidal currents ellipses show a significant increase in magnitude, specially on the semidiurnal constituents. The M2 presents a great polarization (large eccentricity) in the entrance vicinity to Baia de Camamu and Baia de Todos os Santos and, in the shelf zone comprised between Morro de Sao Paulo to Ilha de Ita-parica (See Figure 1.1 for geographical reference), suggesting intense cross-shelf tidal currents. The tidal currents attain values around 10 to 12 cm-1 along the shelf zone and values higher than 30 cm-1 on Baia de Todos os Santos entrance channel and interior. The S2 constituent presents a similar spatial distribution, but reduced values (Figure 4.3).\nIn the shelf zone, comprised between Morro de Sao Paulo to Salvador, a series of steep submarine channels, known as Salvador Canyon are active, transporting sediments to the deep oceanic deposits. The remarkable semidiurnal polarization and intense cross-shelf flow are possibly a major physical intervenient in this process, whose role is still to be investigated.\nFigure 4.3: Barotropic tidal ellipses for the main semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal components (M2, S2, O1, K1) along the central zone of the Eastern Brazilian Margin (L2 grid). Tidal current ellipses expresses the major and minor axis length while the radial line inside indicates the phase relative to greenwich (G \u00b0).

Note the different scale on semidiurnal and diurnal components.\nThe tidal ellipses results for the L3 grid (~ 1km), focusing on the inner Baea de Camamu and on the adjacent coastal ocean, are presented in Figure 4.4. From these results, its noticeable the amplification on the semidiurnal and diurnal constituents along the shelf and the great amplification and polarization on the semi-diurnal components along the system mouth and towards the inner bay system. On the diurnal components, a higher polarization occurs toward the inner bay but not an amplification. According to Prandle [1997], the diurnal currents are more sensitive to friction than the semidiurnal ones of the same magnitude. The semi-diurnal amplification is also remarkable on the sea surface height at the inner bay stations, compared to the along-coast ones (Table 4.2).\n-39.2\t-39.1\t-39\t-38.9\t-38.8\t-38.7\t-38.6\n38.5\nFigure 4.4: Barotropic tidal ellipses for the main semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal components (M2, S2, O1, K1,) in the shelf vicinity and inner Baea de Camamu (L3 grid).

In the current experiment, a third and fourth level nested grids was set over a ROMS coastal system, with the purpose of investigating the barotropic tidal propagation along different spatial scales on the Eastern Brazilian Margin and, towards the shallower domains on the shelf, near shore and inner Baia de Camamu.\nThe results indicate that the model tides compares quantitatively well with observations in terms of sea-surface height, with discrepancies in amplitude of the most energetic M2 constituent varying from 8.5% at the Northernmost station to less than 6% at the Southernmost coastal station. For the S2 constituent, discrepancy value lower than 1% is found at the inner Baia de Camamu station. Comparison in terms of Greenwich phases, denotes a good response for most constituents and stations and discrepancies lower than 20\u00b0 are found for the M2 in every five tidal stations and for the K1 along four tidal stations. Considering all possible interferences on the model results and the relatively simple configurations adopted, the model response is quite robust, showing lesser quantitative discrepancies on phase and amplitude than previews modeled results from the literature.\nFor instance, the remarkable semidiurnal polarization and intense cross-shelf flow in the shelf vicinity of submarine canyons may be an active physical process in the sediment and debris flow dynamics, whose dynamics is still to be investigated. The stratification was not considered in this study because the interaction of barotropic tides and steep topography has the potential of generating internal tides, making the flow pattern complex with the presence of time dependent stratification. Nevertheless, internal waves has also the potential of intensifying the bottom currents and generate more polarization, as evidenced by Vitorino et al. [2002] along the Porto Canyon, in the northern Portuguese shelf.\nChapter 5\nFinal remarks and future work perspectives\nAlong the development of this thesis many science ideas came up. While some were incorporated into the work others although scientifically interesting were far too broad and possibly could be the theme of a dissertation itself. Some of the ideas that I believe deserves to be considered as motivations for future works or as complementary efforts on the achieved work, are discussed bellow.\nIn a mesoscale perspective, the implementation of a automated method for eddy identification, or even the combination of different ones, for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, isolating and tracking the seasonal eddies translation along the EBM (as evidenced on Chapter 2), on a series of consecutive years, would define the seasonal dynamics with greater precision. One objective method, the OkuboWeiss, which defines a vortex as a simple connected region with values of OkuboWeiss parameter weaker than a given threshold, was applied by Henson and Thomas [2008] for identifying and tracking anticyclonic eddies along 15 years of satellite sea level anomaly data, on the Gulf of Alaska, allowing a precise definition on the spatial and temporal variability and providing the first systematic census of anticyclonic eddies for that region. Nevertheless, Chaigneau et al. [2008], working with the same subject along the coast of Peru, shows that the rarely-used geometrical or winding-angle method, based on the curvature of the\nstreamline functions, was more accurate than the OkuboWeiss algorithm. This is a subject of fast growing literature, whose achievements have never been applied to the EBM.\nEstuaries are transitional and complex water bodies that differ considerably from the neighboring fluvial or from the adjacent coastal marine systems on its character and management. In the present thesis, Baeia de Camamu was investigated based on the analysis of an relatively extensive field data set covering dry (September, 2004) and rainy (July, 2005) conditions. In general, the findings of a study at one estuary can not be easily transferred to another due to its unique physical setting. In this work, a great effort was done to summarize Baia de Camamu physical setting (Chapter 3), establishing a basis for comparison.\nOn estuaries, water quality or sediment dynamics are complex to monitor due to both upstream (fluvial) and downstream (oceanic) sources. The tidal forcing and the fresh water discharge are key factors determining its dynamics [Miranda et al., 2002], emphasizing the estuarine transitional nature. The implementation of a numerical modelling is a necessary step forward on the science and on the monitoring Baeia de Camamu effort. Nevertheless, due to the complex dynamical character, oversimplified models are not always suitable to investigate the hydrodynamics of an estuary while complex models are of difficult implementation due to intrinsic estuarine factors such as the variable watershed (wet and dry zones), low depth, variable river discharge or complex geomorphology, among others.\nThe addition of tide signal in a regional modeling system is a necessary step on the establishment of a realistic coastal model, specially when you wish to consider estuarine connections, as on the case of Central Eastern Brazilian Margin. In Chapter 4, a third and fourth level grids was set over a ROMS configuration as step forward in the process of developing a tide-permitting model response for the zone.\nFurthermore, in Chapter 4 we have focused on barotropic tidal ellipses patterns on shelf and near coast zones. We understand that there are still room for improvements towards more realistic condition that may lead to stronger environmental ties and to fully characterization of tidal currents in the margin. Future steps on this purpose must face with sensitivity evaluation of tidal currents to varying drag coefficients and to stratification. Because the interaction of barotropic tides, stratification and steep topography has the potential of generating internal tides, intensifying the bottom currents and possibly strengthening the polarization, this is a step to be followed if the intense cross-shelf flow in the shelf vicinity of submarine canyons is to be considered. Once these steps were accomplished, the vertical structure of tidal ellipses parameters in shelf zones shall also be investigated, taking full advantage of a three dimensional simulation.\nLast, because of the lack of references we could not adequately compare Chapter 4 model solution. Time-series of shelf and estuarine currents are a must for accurate validations of tidal current ellipse components. Some efforts have been done by Universidade Federal da Bahia to fill this gap. The author hopes that future cooperation and personal efforts at Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, will provide the means for making novel measurements efforts on Baia de Camamu and adjacent shelf zone, allowing a deeper analysis of our modelling work and enhancing new objectives and studies. The present thesis however, establishes a reference for the Eastern Brazilian Margin multi-scale dynamics oceanography.\nBibliography\nAlencastro, L. F., 2000.
