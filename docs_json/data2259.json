Creio que eles deram a mim ambas primorosamente. Al\u00e9m dos meus\n\npais, posso citar o apoio das av\u00f3s sempre muito queridas, bem como de outros familiares\n\nque sempre depositaram em mim esperan\u00e7a para dar-me for\u00e7as de seguir meus sonhos.\n\nMuito h\u00e1 o que agradecer ao meu orientador professor Celso Pesce. Um homem\n\nde vis\u00e3o que sempre viu em mim algo que ainda n\u00e3o consegui e, ao depositar sua f\u00e9\n\nem mim, deu-me oportunidades, oportunidade para ser orientado, para crescer, para\n\ntrabalhar com outros tantos colegas geniais. Ainda assim, creio que o mais caro que\n\npude receber dele foram palavras em momentos dif\u00edceis. Fora meus pais, acho que\n\napenas Celso realmente acredita e deposita tua f\u00e9 em mim t\u00e3o sinceramente.\n\nN\u00e3o poderia deixar de agradecer minha terapeuta Carol porque, sem a ajuda dela,\n\neu n\u00e3o teria conseguido sobreviver aos meus 20-e-poucos at\u00e9 o presente momento. Os\n\nanos 2007 da Britney chega para todos.\n\nSeguindo aos colegas, o primeiro n\u00e3o poderia deixar de ser o professor Guilherme\n\nFranzini por ter tanta paci\u00eancia para conseguir acompanhar-me com passos muito mais\n\nlentos do que os dele. Aos colegas Caio e Luzia, apenas penso em v\u00f3s como figuras\n\nangelicais que foram postas no meu dia-a-dia.\n\n\u00c0 equipa do LMO por estar presente em diversos momentos da minha vida\n\nacad\u00eamica.

Riser dynamics is essentially non-linear\n\nand experimental tests in real scale are almost impossible due to a great variety of\n\ncontrol parameters acting concomitantly. Small-scale models are a better experimental\n\napproach. Nevertheless, there are many structural and hydrodynamical parameters\n\nto be evaluated. Considering only vertical risers in the present work, Galerkin\u2019s modal\n\ndecomposition is used in order to reduce the dynamics of a vertical flexible cylinder to a\n\nfew linear modes in which the majority of energy and information are contained. From\n\nthe modal analysis, added mass and structural parameters damping of a vertical flexible\n\ncylinder using data obtained from free-decay tests performed both in water and in air are\n\nevaluated. Finally, a modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator with non-linear damping is constructed\n\nand, based on a Strutt diagram, modal stability under parametric resonance is discussed.\n\nKeywords: Flexible pipes, Riser, Fluid-structure interaction, Offshore structure,\n\nMathieu instability.\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nExplora\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo e g\u00e1s em bacias de \u00e1guas profundas tem-se tornado mais\n\ndo que apenas uma economia lucrativa, para ser uma necessidade di\u00e1ria, j\u00e1 que\n\na matriz energ\u00e9tica mundial est\u00e1 baseada em componentes f\u00f3sseis. Risers s\u00e3o\n\nestruturas offshore ligadas intimamente com a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo e g\u00e1s e essas est\u00e3o\n\nsujeitas a uma grande variedade de efeitos na opera\u00e7\u00e3o, e.g., correntes mar\u00edtimas,\n\nVibra\u00e7\u00f5es Induzidas por V\u00f3rtices (VIV), movimento de heave causado por ondas\n\ngravitacionais, contato n\u00e3o-linear com o solo marinho, entre outros. Din\u00e2mica de risers\n\n\u00e9 essencialmente n\u00e3o-linear e testes experimentais em escala real s\u00e3o praticamente\n\nimposs\u00edveis devido a uma enorme variedade de par\u00e2metros de controle agindo\n\nconcomitantemente. Modelos em escala reduzida s\u00e3o uma abordagem experimental\n\nmais conveniente. N\u00e3o obstante, h\u00e1 muitos par\u00e2metros estruturais e hidrodin\u00e2micos\n\na serem determinados. Considerando apenas risers verticais no trabalho presente,\n\na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o modal de Galerkin \u00e9 usada a fim de reduzir a din\u00e2mica de um\n\ncilindro fl\u00e9xivel vertical a alguns modos lineares em que a maior parte da energia e\n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e3o contidos. A partir da an\u00e1lise modal, par\u00e2metros de massa adicional\n\ne amortecimento estrutural de um cilindro flex\u00edvel vertical s\u00e3o obtidos usando testes\n\nde decaimento livre conduzidos na \u00e1gua e no ar.

The LIFE&amp;MO has dedicated its lifetime to study fluid-structure\ninteraction phenomena and many aspects of offshore mechanics since 1990. Such\nthemes include structural mechanics of risers, pipes and mooring lines, dynamic\npositioning of floating stations, non-linear dynamics and hydrodynamics. Its main subject\nis Offshore Engineering in deep water, patronized by institutions such as: Prysmian,\nPetrobras, FAPESP, CNPq and FINEP. Some pioneering works developed by the LMO\ngroup culminated with, just to cite a few:\n\n\u2022 The Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) draft which, pioneering, was installed on a\nsemi-submersible platform (the P-18), see Pesce et al. (1994);\n\n\u2022 A first methodology establishment for design of a SCR, see (Pesce et al., 1996);\n\n\u2022 The analytical treatment of riser dynamics, see Pesce (1997), Aranha et al. (1997),\nPesce and Fujarra (1997), Fujarra et al. (1997), Pesce et al. (1998), Pesce et al.\n(1999), Ramos Jr. and Pesce (2003), Pesce et al. (2006a) and Silveira et al. (2007).;\n\nConcerning experimental activities, LMO and LIFE&amp;MO have been pioneers at\nusing several new monitoring techniques for VIV in flexible cylinders and riser models\nsince 1997. Among those techniques, some uses accelerometry and conventional\nextensometry installed and distributed along the tested cylinder length; for further details,\ne.g., Fujarra (1997), Fujarra et al. (1998), Pesce and Fujarra (2000), Fujarra et al.\n(2001) and Fujarra (2002). The aforementioned experimental tests were performed at\nfacilities, such as: Institute for Technological Research (IPT), the Michigan University\nand the Cornell University. The distributed extensometry technique were considered an\ninnovation within the international community, as references such as Pesce and Fujarra\n(2000) and Fujarra et al. (2001) are acknowledged on important papers on VIV; see\nWilliamson and Govardhan (2004). Those techniques are still used nowadays at LMO,\ne.g., Franzini et al. (2008), Franzini et al. (2009) and Franzini et al. (2011a), and other\nresearch groups, e.g., Morooka et al. (2009).\n\nThe LMO was also internationally pioneer using the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)\nin order to analyze non-linear phenomena such as VIV; see Pesce et al. (2006), Silveira et\nal. (2007), Franzini et al. (2008), Franzini et al. (2010),Franzini et al. (2011a) and Franzini\net al. (2011b). The HHT is a technique in which it is possible to obtain a time-frequency\nspectral analysis from extremely non-ergodic signals. This signal analysis tool was\nsuccessfully employed on studies of offshore platforms Vortex-Induced Motion (VIM)\nphenomena; see Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2012).\n\nHereupon, the R&amp;D project entitled \u201cNon-Linear Dynamics of Risers: non-linear\ninteractions of hydro-elastic and contact nature\u201d1 was contracted to Universidade de S\u00e3o\nPaulo (USP) by Petrobras in late 2009, under the Offshore Structures Thematic Network.\nIts scope is based on four complementary activities, as follows:\n\n1. Mathematical modeling of risers dynamics with reduction techniques by using\nnon-linear modes representation;\n\n1The original title is in Portuguese: \u201cDin\u00e2mica n\u00e3o-linear de Risers: Intera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o-lineares de\nnatureza hidro-el\u00e1stica e de contato\u201d.\n\n\n\nxxii\n\n2. Parametric excitations and internal resonant responses, arising from dynamical\ninteraction in several time and space scales, between heave imposed at the top\nand Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV);\n\n3. Analysis of typical cases, focusing on non-linear dynamics of risers;\n\n4. Experimental dynamics tests with riser small-scale model.\n\nIt is worthy mentioning that the \u201cNon-Linear Dynamics of Risers\u201d project has enabled\nthe LIFE&amp;MO to advance on state-of-art researches on VIV and riser dynamics,\nimproving technical and scientific topics related to theoretical models, modeling and\nmonitoring techniques, as well as on several experimental analysis techniques applied\nto tests with small-scale riser models with catenary-shape and vertical configurations. It\nmight be remarked the following advances:\n\n1. Small-scale modeling and monitoring techniques\n\n(a) Development of a new methodology for designing a small-scale riser models\nin which a silicon tube is filled with stainless steel micro-spheres, providing a\ngeometrical, structural and dynamical hydro-elastic Froude similitude with a\nriser in real scale; see LIFE&amp;MO (2012b) and Pereira et al. (2012);\n\n(b) Development and consolidation of displacement measurement technique\nalong the model span, using an optical tracking system of cameras placed\non air and immersed at different laboratory facilities: a Water Channel (NDF),\na Hydrodynamic Calibrator (CH-TPN), and a Towing Tank (IPT); further details\non LIFE&amp;MO (2012a, 2012b), Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013)\nand Pereira et al. (2013).\n\n2. Experimental analysis techniques\n\n(a) Consolidation of an analysis methodology in which conventional techniques\nare merged, such as: statistical methods, spectrum analysis (energy\nspectrum along model span) and time-domain analysis (amplitude-time\nscalograms); see LIFE&amp;MO (2012c, 2012d);\n\n(b) Crystallization of the time-frequency spectrum analysis using the HHT;\nLIFE&amp;MO (2012b), Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013), Pereira\net al. (2013) Franzini et al. (2015) and Franzini et al. (2016);\n\n(c) Development of a modal decomposition method in VIV studies in flexible\ncylinders; as it may be regarded in LIFE&amp;MO (2012d) and Franzini et al.\n(2014).\n\nAmong those advances enumerated before, the particular design of a small-scale\nexperimental model based on a silicon tube filled with stainless steel micro-spheres might\nbe pointed out as a great innovation on the experimental field. The author had the chance\nof a life time to be part of the group who developed such experimental method, being able\nto collaborate actively; see Pereira et al. (2012).\n\nAll work carried out on the aforementioned project might be summed up on the series\nof technical reports LIFE&amp;MO (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f, 2012a,\n2012b, 2012c, 2012d) and a colossal and unique amount of experimental data, including\nseveral appendices. An interesting note might be made, quoting the preface from\nLIFE&amp;MO (2012d), which says:\n\n\n\nxxiii\n\nThe specific results obtained [on the technical reports LIFE&amp;MO\n(2012c, 2012d)] [...] are unique, since they came from a thorough\nplanning and testing which were conducted systematically with a\ngreat degree of comprehensiveness and completeness.\nThe reader will be able to verify that the huge experimental data\nbase [...] will serve not only to technical and scientific insights of\nexperimental nature, however primarily to verification of theoretical\nmodels, whether numerical or analytical, being able to become an\nimportant source of benchmarking to industry, with consequent\nimpact assessments on risers design meyhodology. (LIFE&amp;MO,\n2012d, p. 12, own translation)\n\nIt is possible to affirm that the regarded R&amp;D project is unique and its large\nexperimental data base will provide bright scientific insight for the next years. At least,\nthat is what it is hoped.\n\n\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe dynamics of risers is eminently of nonlinear character, since it deals with vibration\nphenomena on large aspect ratio, L/D ? 100, flexible cylindrical structures, associated\nwith interactions with the fluid medium surrounding them and the combined support\nexcitations and internal resonances of parametric nature. The complexity of these\nconcurrent interactions - associated with its practical relevance in ocean engineering\n- makes the research topic in screen to remain in full development, both nationally and\ninternationally, as evidenced by the long list of publications in the field, which forms part\nof Chapter 2.\n\nFigure 1.1: Typical riser configurations: vertical and SCR.\n\n(a) Vertical riser. (b) SCR, lazy-wave and other riser configurations.\n\nSource: Extracted from (a) \u2013 Kuiper (2008); (b) \u2013 Orcina Software.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 2\n\nRisers are structures that transport, from the ocean floor till the ocean surface,\neconomical commodities, e.g., oil and gas. Together with oil and gas, sea water, salt,\nsand, sediments, are also conveyed. Risers might be presented as a nearly rigid\nstructure, for shallow waters, or flexible, for deep-water and ultra deep-waters fields.\nBesides, there are different configurations according to which a riser may be installed,\nsuch as, the Steel \u201cCanetary\u201d Riser (SCR), lazy-wave, top tensioned vertical riser, and so\non; see Figure 1.1. What will determine the riser configuration is the sort of floating unit\nfrom which is suspended, the local depth and other in financial parameters.\n\nAs mentioned before, the riser dynamics is a subject in which several phenomena\noccur with different time and space scales. Among all sorts of Fluid-Structure\nphenomena, Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) over the spanwise and parametric\nresonance due to heave motion imposed at the top of the line by gravitational waves over\nthe vessel in which risers are suspended; are to be emphasized Figure 1.2. Generally,\nVIV and heave play concomitant action on the structure, however the present work will\nonly deal with effects due to parametric resonance, modal structural parameters and\nhydrodynamical coefficients in still water.\n\nFigure 1.2: Plataform and other ocean units on which risers might be used.\n\nSource: Extracted from Assi (2009).\n\nThe small-scale model developed back in 2011 to conduct experimental campaigns\nat NDF, TPN and IPT will be soon detailed in Chapter 4. In order to study the elastica\ndynamical behavior in the experiments, it was proposed a non-intrusive observation\nusing cameras capturing the Cartesian motion of an amount of optical targets attached in\nthe model. The number of optical targets is 43 (experiments in water) and 54 (experiments\nin air).\n\nAnalyzing around 50 temporal series for each Cartesian direction of each target\nwould be a huge work that not necessarily would show some correlations, or internal\nresonances easily. Following the Zeitgeist proposed in LIFE&amp;MO (2012d), the modal\ndecomposition is studied and it is used to condensate the most part of the information\ncontained in all temporal series of each target in a few modal ones.\n\nThe choice of a modal basis to conduct a modal decomposition is properly discussed\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 3\n\nin the light of Galerkin\u2019s method. The climax of modal decomposition is reached when\na modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator is determined from a proposed theoretical continuum\nformulation of a heavy vertical line with imposed motion at the top in Chapter 3.\n\nConsidering initially the experimental results obtained in LIFE&amp;MO (2012d) from\nthe perspective of the modal oscillator, it exists the possibility to define a few modal\nparameters, e.g., total modal mass, structural linear modal damping, modal structural\nstiffness and hydrodynamical non-linear damping. The total modal mass parameter\nis consisted of the structural mass (known) and the added mass (unknown) and\nthe damping effect from both structural and hydrodynamical is amalgamated, being\nimpossible to isolate one from the other without previously evaluating the structural linear\ndamping.\n\nThe experimental campaign conducted in air comes to attention in order to evaluate\nthe modal structural damping coefficient using a simple free-decay test. Besides, it is\nshown that it is also possible to estimate directly the modal added mass parameter when\nboth experiments in water and in air are compared one to the other in a certain physical\ncondition of modal structural stiffness equivalence between the experiments proposed.\n\nExploring the modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator, the experiment in water presents a\nnon-linear term due to hydrodynamical damping mainly caused by drag forces, being\nnecessary to use a perturbation techniques proposed by Ramani et al. (2004), yielding\nto a local solution in the instability area in Strutt diagram. Finally, it is possible to study\nthe modal stability by means of Strutt diagram, looking for results that might be inside any\ninstability tongue.\n\nThe text is organized as follows:\n\nChapter 1: This is the present Chapter, dealing with this text context and main points of\norganization;\n\nChapter 2: The Literature Review is dedicated to invite the reader to discuss about the\nfundamental bibliography of topics that will be presented in this work. The\nauthor aimed at giving some historical and philosophical context, with some\ncontemplative and reflexive thoughts;\n\nChapter 3: The Theoretical Background chapter acts as door into the mathematical and\nphysical realms, from which the fundamental theoretical basis to deal with\nthe phenomenology that appears inhere arises;\n\nChapter 4: The presentation of the methodology used to conduct an experimental test of\nfree-decay and imposed heave motion at the top, similar to the one described\nin (LIFE&amp;MO, 2012d) is given;\n\nChapter 5: The Analysis and Experimental Methodology chapter brings a discussion\nabout the work carried out in the present work;\n\nChapter 6: The Results obtained using the methodology described in the previous\nchapters and a few suggestions of further works are addressed;\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 4\n\nChapter 7: The References section presents an unique survey of works from which some\nuseful insights, data, figures, thoughts, or any other form of acknowledgment\nhas been extracted.\n\n\n\n5\n\nChapter 2\n\nLiterature review\n\nThe stilly murmur of the distant Sea\n\nTells us of silence.\n\nAnd that simplest Lute,\n\nPlaced length-ways in the clasping casement,\n\n[ hark!\n\n[...]\n\nO! the one Life within us and abroad,\n\nWhich meets all motion and becomes its soul,\n\nA light in sound, a sound-like power in light,\n\nRhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere\u2013\n\nMethinks, it should have been impossible\n\nNot to love all things in a world so filled;\n\nWhere the breeze warbles, and the mute still air\n\nIs Music slumbering on her instrument.\n\n\u201cThe Eolian Harp\u201d (excerpt) by Samuel Taylor\n\nColeridge, 1795.\n\nOne might say the natural order of nature is to have no order at all. The apparent\n\norder humankind supposes to perceive is an illusion caused by the absence of two very\n\nconflicting panoramas, by being unable to regard the whole universe at once, or to see on\n\nquantum scale. However, it is possible to find some order on the way in which mankind\n\ninteracts and this fact could be pointed out as a great sparkle that has puzzled many\n\ningenious minds since the establishment of the human race.\n\nPhilosophy and Mathematics are not the same, although they have a non-empty\n\nintersection. Clearly both subjects are infinite on their very own way, having a lot in\n\ncommon, but mathematics has some impishness that the other does not. If it is possible to\n\nconceive the idea that all sciences have come from the marriage between philosophy and\n\nmathematics, mechanics would have been their first child. In this context, Mathematics\n\nshall be understood as a language to express natural phenomenon concepts which one\n\nmay gaze through Philosophy, as far as art, music and literature are a sort of language\n\nwith whom one desires to express what their soul longs to say.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 6\n\nHistorically, the first mathematical language well defined was geometry, as it may\n\nbe regarded with fundamental works of Euclid (c. 300 BC, 2002) and many others\n\nmathematicians. Geometry is a powerful language that has been found on all mechanical\n\nworks since the Archimedes\u2019 Principle of the Levers, one of the most fundamental\n\nprinciples of statics, as it is said by Lagrange (1736\u20131813):\n\nArchim\u00e8de, le seul parmi les anciens qui nous ait laiss\u00e9 quelque th\u00e9orie sur\n\nla m\u00e9canique dans ses deux livres de \u00c6quiponderantibus, est l\u2019auteur du\n\nprincipe du levier, lequel consiste, comme tout le monde fait, en ce que si\n\nun levier droit est charg\u00e9 de deux poids quelconques plac\u00e9s de part et d\u2019autre\n\ndu point d\u2019appui \u00e0 des distances de ce point r\u00e9ciproquement proportionnelles\n\naux m\u00eames poids, ce levier sera en \u00e9quilibre et son appui sera charg\u00e9 de la\n\nsomme des deux poids. (LAGRANGE, 1989, p. 2)1\n\nAs Dark Ages rose, science found a rich nest among Arabs, Chineses and Indians.\n\nThe most significant contributions were led by Arabs who took into advantage all\n\nacknowledgment acquired by the Romans and placed in libraries across the Empire,\n\ne.g. Library of Alexandria. Among a few notable Arab mathematic findings, it is possible\n\nto mention: the definition of the zero number; algebraic notations which are used still\n\nnowadays; extensive studies with polynomials and their roots; numerical methods for\n\nevaluating square and cubic roots; and even introduction of the proof by induction.\n\nThe 17th century Enlightenment brought a breath of fresh air to science and, by the\n\nend of that century, mechanics would have been metamorphosed into a solid ground for\n\nthose who wanted to wonder about the universe; the triad of works developed by Galilei\n\n(1638), Huygens (1673) &amp; Newton (1687) opened doors to a whole new world.\n\nA truly important question had risen: what would the fundamental principle of\n\nmechanics be? Such an idea came from a principle Fermat (1601\u20131665) derived from\n\nHuygens-Fresnel principle in which light should always take a path between two points\n\nthat can be transversed in the least time. Lanczos, in his masterpiece The Variational\n\nPrinciples of Mechanics, (Lanczos, 1970), wrote a brief introduction very clarifying about\n\nthe philosophical evaluations of mechanics at the 17th\u201318th centuries.\n\n1Archimedes, the only one among the ancients who has actually left us some theory about\nmechanics on his two books of \u00c6quiponderantibus, is the author of the principle of the lever, which\nconsists on the statement, as everyone does, that if a straight lever is to be loaded by any two weights\nplaced on either side of its support point, placed at distances reciprocally proportional to those weights,\nthe lever will be in equilibrium and its support point will be loaded with the sum of both weights. (Own\ntranslation)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 7\n\nThe keynote of that entire period was the seemingly per-established harmony\n\nbetween \u201creason\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d. The great discoveries of higher mathematics\n\nand their immediate application to nature imbued the philosophers of those\n\ndays with an unbounded confidence in the fundamentally intellectual structure\n\nof the world. [...] But this is not surprising if we observe how the\n\npurely \u00e6sthetic and logical interest in maximum-minimum problems gave\n\none of the strongest impulses to the development of infinitesimal calculus,\n\nand how Fermat\u2019s derivation of the laws of geometrical optics on the\n\nbasis of his \u201cprinciple of quickest arrival\u201d could not fail to impress the\n\nphilosophically-orientally scientists of those days. (LANCZOS, 1970, p. xxvii)\n\nThe principle of least action appeared on mechanics, establishing a dual\n\ncorrespondence with Fermat\u2019s principle on geometrical optics2. This principle has many\n\nforms of being presented, but, for the sake of simplicity, it will be considered as Hamilton\u2019s\n\nprinciple. It is noteworthy that the principle of least action was misused by Maupertuis\n\n(1698\u20131759) and others on a metaphysical context; Lanczos, in (Lanczos, 1970, p.\n\nxxvii), also wrote about it arguing: \u201c[...] the dilettante misuse of these tendencies [of\n\nworld intellectual structure] [sic] by Maupertuis and others for theological purposes has\n\nput the entire trend into disrepute, is not the fault of the great philosophers\u201d. Lagrange,\n\nin his headstone M\u00e9canique Analytique (Lagrange, 1989, p. 189), mentioned that \u201c[...]\n\nest le Principe auquel je donne ici, quoique improprement le nom de moindre action, &amp;\n\nque je regarde non comme un principe m\u00e9taphysique, mais comme un r\u00e9sultat simple &amp;\n\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral des loix [sic] de la M\u00e9chanique\u201d, consolidating the principle of least action only\n\nas a scientific principle on the analytical mechanics realm.\n\nAlthough the classical holonomic Hamilton\u2019s principle is applicable for arbitrary\n\nsystems, it is not quite general, because it only holds for systems characterized by\n\nmonogenic forces and holonomic auxiliary conditions3. As a matter of fact, Hamilton\u2019s\n\nprinciple may be derived by the Principle of Virtual Work (PVW), already known in\n\nstatics, together with d\u2019Alembert (1717\u20131783) principle4. D\u2019Alembert\u2019s principle is a\n\nbridge between dynamics and statics, bringing into light the possibility of finding a system\n\nof differential equations which describes the system dynamics, as much as the PVW\n\nshall be employed in order to find a system of algebraic equations which solves a static\n\nproblem.\n\nOn the mechanics realm, it may be pointed out d\u2019Alembert\u2019s principle and the PVW\n\nas fundamental principles of statics and dynamics. These two principles reproduce the\n\nHamilton\u2019s principle and, by doing so, they reduce the fundamental problem of dynamics\n\nas a calculus of variations problem, a branch of calculus developed by Euler (1707\u20131783)\n\n2In this case, the principle of least action shall be understood as Jacobi\u2019s principle.\n3Conditions that can be written upon a differential form which may be integrated, also known as\n\nPfaffian form.\n4Later, by using a proper treatment on the Hamilton\u2019s principle, it has been generalized for systems\n\nwith changing mass \u2013 e.g., McIver (1973) \u2013 and for non-material systems; see Casetta and Pesce\n(2013).\n\n\n\n2.1. APPROACHES TO MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS 8\n\nand Lagrange. This leads to Euler-Lagrange equations of movement, or even Hamilton\n\nequations; further acknowledgments may be obtained in Goldstein (1965), Lanczos\n\n(1970), Gantmacher (1975), Meirovitch (1980, 2003), Dugas (1988), Whittaker (1988),\n\nLagrange (1989) &amp; Gelfand and Fomin (2000).\n\n2.1 Approaches to modeling and dynamical experimental analysis\n\nInroads at the flexible cylinder system have been done over time using analytical,\n\nsemi-analytical and numerical models. There are structural models from the simplest\n\ncable \u2013 under small displacement and linear-elastic behavior assumptions \u2013 in which the\n\nrepresentation is done using bars and Euler-Bernoulli tensioned beams, to more complex\n\nmodels in which geometric non linearities or even non linear rheological behavior is taken\n\ninto account.\n\nCalling attention to the analytical and semi-analytical models, it is usual to consider\n\na linear-elastic material. Asymptotic methods and perturbation techniques, e.g., WKB,\n\nallow to reach closed modal representations of the structure dynamics; see Pesce et\n\nal. (1999), Pesce and Martins (2005) &amp; Chatjigeorgiou (2008a, 2008b), all inspired\n\non Triantafyllou (1984). The bending stiffness effect may also be taken into account\n\nanalytically, by introducing an integral concept of equivalent geometric rigidity, as it might\n\nbe seen in Mazzilli et al. (2014).\n\nMore sophisticated approaches, using non-linear modes, e.g., Shaw and Pierre\n\n(1991, 1993), have also reached interesting results. The counterpart of those\n\napproaches is the need for highly complex mathematical techniques, whereas they are\n\nbased on the use of multiple scales methods or a proper finite-element formulation; see\n\nSanches et al. (2007), Mazzilli (2009), LIFE&amp;MO (2011c, 2011d), Mazzilli and Sanches\n\n(2011), Mazzilli et al. (2011) &amp; Prado et al. (2013).\n\nOn the other hand, high-hierarchy numerical model approaches are based on a\n\ngeneral Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation. This is an usual and classical\n\napproach; further acknowledgment might be seen on Pesce and Martins (2005),\n\nHuera-Huarte (2006), Pesce et al. (2006b), Silveira et al. (2007), Rustad et al.\n\n(2008), Morooka and Tsukada (2011), Takafuji and Martins (2012), Main\u00e7on and\n\nBernardo-Viljoen (2013) &amp; Prado et al. (2013). Numerical models that consider large\n\nrotations have shown to be a good approach for some stability investigations; see Gay\n\nNeto and Martins (2013).\n\nRegarding the structure dynamical experimental analysis, several techniques have\n\nbeen employed. From classical techniques, e.g., Galerkin methods, achieving modal\n\ndecomposition representations on a finite Hilbert space \u2013 e.g., Huera-Huarte (2006), Gu\n\net al. (2013) &amp; Franzini et al. (2014) \u2013 to identification techniques of other natures, e.g.,\n\nKassen (2002), Lucor et al. (2006), Lucor and Triantafyllou (2008), Mukundan (2008),\n\n\n\n2.2. SIGNAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 9\n\nMukundan et al. (2009) &amp; Main\u00e7on and Bernardo-Viljoen (2013).\n\nThe modal decomposition has been widely used in recent publications in which\n\nexperimental approaches are dealing with modal parameters as added mass and\n\ndamping; see Franzini et al. (2015). There is also a branch using Reduced Order Models\n\n(ROMs) obtained from modal decomposition in order to study modal added mass and\n\nmean drag force affect; see Franzini et al. (2015) Franzini et al. (2016).\n\n2.2 Signal analysis techniques\n\nInasmuch as the present work gets along with experimental data, it is also important to\n\nuse proper signal analysis techniques which are more suitable for each modal or target\n\ntime series. The experimental database obtained in LIFE&amp;MO (2012c, 2012d) shows a\n\ngreat deal of displacement signals, along with a load cell signal. As it may be seen in\n\nFranzini et al. (2014), such signals are extremely non-ergodic in some cases, presenting\n\namplitude modulation and spectral effects from a different assortment of harmonics; in\n\nfact, Modarres-Sadeghi et al. (2011), via Poincar\u00e9 mapping, have shown that there is a\n\npossible switch behavior on a same signal in which the structure might be periodical at\n\none moment, being followed by a quasi-periodical or even chaotic behavior at another.\n\nSpectral techniques as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform\n\n(STFT), Gabor Transform5 (GT) and Wavelet Transform (WT) might be used somehow to\n\ngive a glimpse of the system dynamical behavior. A simple FFT can, at a first sight, tell a\n\nlot from the signal spectra, however the FFT analysis is best suitable for ergodic signals\n\nwith no amplitude modulation; see Proakis and Manolakis (2007). On the other hand,\n\nthe STFT and the GT would exhibit more reliable results, giving a Joint Time-Frequency\n\nAnalysis (JTFA) with more details about the dynamics hidden on the temporal series; see\n\nHamdan et al. (1996), Jubran et al. (1998) &amp; Ikoma et al. (2012). About JTFA using STFr\n\nand GT, Jubran et al. said:\n\n5Gabor Transform is a special case of a Short Time Fourier Transform in which the window used is\na Gaussian-type function.\n\n\n\n2.2. SIGNAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 10\n\nIt is to be noted that STFT method is one of the most widely used classical\n\nmethods of JTFA, which is also used, for the analysis of nonstationary signals\n\nwhere the time series is scanned in overlapping windows. Thus, STFT\n\ngives a redundant information and only a part of it is sufficient to synthesize\n\nexactly the input signal using the inverse STFT. Although, STFT suffers from\n\nmany pitfalls, such as aliasing, time window effect, picket fence effects, and\n\nbandwidth-localization tradeoff. For example, for a large analysis window, low\n\nfrequencies can be calculated, while high frequencies are poorly localized. On\n\nthe other hand, the STFr in time and frequency domains can not be arbitrarily\n\nsmall because their product is lower banded [...]\n\nThus, for impulsive and nonstationary signals which requires good time\n\nfrequency resolution, classical STFT ceases to be productive, since STFr\n\ncan not either provide good frequency-resolution nor good time resolution.\n\n(JUBRAN ET AL., 1998, p. 585, emphasis added)\n\nThereby, a properly chosen wavelet base would be a better choice than a simpler STFr.\n\nAs an alternative, there is the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) which has been used on\n\nexperimental data from fluid-structure interaction phenomena, specially VIV and VIM,\n\nsince Pesce et al. (2006). The HHT has shown to be a very useful and reliable technique\n\nfor the interpretation of phenomena in which amplitude-frequency modulation occurs;\n\nsee Franzini et al. (2011a), Franzini et al. (2011b), Franzini et al. (2012), Gon\u00e7alves et al.\n\n(2012), Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013) &amp; Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2013).\n\n\n\n11\n\nChapter 3\n\nTheoretical background\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, there is no mystery about these distortions of nature about\n\nwhich we still hear complaints in discussions on modern art. Everyone who\n\nhas ever seen a Disney film or a comic strip knows all about it. [...] Mickey\n\nMouse does not look very much like a real mouse, yet people do not write\n\nindignant letters to the papers about the length of his tail.\u201d\n\nThe Story of Art (excerpt) by Sir Ernst H. Gombrich.\n\nFollowing, it will be presented the theoretical background of this present work, but,\n\nfirstly, it shall be remarked how this chapter is organized. There are four main subjects to\n\nbe placed on the theoretical background which refer to:\n\n1. Development of small-scale model for the flexible vertical cylinder;\n\n2. Experimental mathematical formulation:\n\n(a) Approaches from different models;\n\n(b) Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions: the Sturm-Liouville problem associated to\n\neach sort of model;\n\n(c) Defining the suitable modal decomposition;\n\n3. Modal oscillator\n\n3.1 Modal mathematical formulation\n\n3.1.1 The classical vibrating string\n\nThe vibrating string is a mechanical system in which there is a material medium, the string,\n\nthat is able to transfer information from one point to another through a wave. That system\n\nis essentially one-dimensional, but it can be extended to higher dimensional applications\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 12\n\non the theory of vibrating plates or bodies. The information is propagated along the\n\nvibrating string at the sound velocity, which is a directed function of the material medium\n\n(string) mechanical properties; see Rayleigh (1896). The called classical vibrating string\n\npresents axial constant tension at each point of the string.\n\nA phenomena such as the string vibration and its effects over nature should be\n\nregarded as a puzzle that has been bewitching philosophers since Pythagoras (c.\n\n570BC-\u2013c. 495BC). Historically, Pythagoras was the first philosophically oriented\n\nmathematician to demonstrate a proportional relationship between sound and the\n\nwavelength of a stationary vibrating string. Such proportional relationship is known as\n\nharmonic series; e.g., the harmonic series of C2, see Figure 3.1, also known as C on\n\nHelmholtz designation, Helmholtz (1885).\n\nFigure 3.1: Harmonic series of C2\n\nThe idea behind the harmonic series is ingenious: Pythagoras stated that, given an\n\nideal string with a fundamental frequency, every rational multiple of this fundamental\n\nfrequency is related to a wavelength inversely proportional to the integer chosen; see\n\nFigure 3.2. From the harmonic series, it is possible to determine the perfect fifths1 chain\n\n(F-C-G-D-A-E-B) and, then, it is also possible to find the seven natural pitches of the\n\ndiatonic scale, that are still used nowadays in music. Besides the chain of perfect fifths,\n\nthe diatonic scale and harmonic series, Pythagoras\u2019 works on the vibrating string precede\n\nthe Major scale, the Ionian mode, a basis for musical composition.\n\n1A perfect fifth is related to the third harmonic of the harmonic series proposed by Pythagoras;\nactually, the third harmonic is the perfect fifth of the second harmonic, so there is a ratio 2 : 3 between\na pitch and its perfect fifth. For example, if C3 (130.81Hz) is considered to be the fundamental note, its\nperfect fifth would be the G3 (196.15Hz); see Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 13\n\nFigure 3.2: Pythagorean relationship between frequency and wavelength in a ideal vibranting string\n\nAfter this brief introduction, it will be presented a mathematical model to the classical\n\nvibrating string. The schematic model is seen in Figure 3.3.\n\nFigure 3.3: Schematic model of a classical vibrating string bi-articulated with constant distributed mass,\n\u00b5, and constant traction, T.\n\nThe string is supposed to have constant length, even when it is transversally deformed\n\nand it is considered bi-articulated in order to neglect flexural effects near its ends. The\n\ntransversal displacement is given by u (z,t). The stationary wave equation, eq. 3.1, will\nbe used as a mathematical model.\n\n\u00b5 (z)\n?2u\n\n?t2\n=\n\n?\n\n?z\n\n[\nT (z)\n\n?u\n\n?z\n\n]\n(3.1)\n\nFor constant tension, it is possible to rewrite eq. 3.1 as follows:\n\n?2u\n\n?t2\n=\nT\n\n\u00b5\n\n?2u\n\n?z2\n= c20\n\n?2u\n\n?z2\n(3.2)\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 14\n\nIn which c0 = T/\u00b5 is the wave celerity. The variable separation method is employed\non u (z,t) = ? (z) ? (t) in order to uncouple both variables; see Tikhonov and Samarskii\n(1980). Using the variable separation proposed before on eq. 3.2, it is possible to write2:\n\n? (z) ?? (t) = c20?\n?? (z) ? (t) ?\n\n?? (t)\n? (t)\n\n= c20\n??? (z)\n? (z)\n\n= ??2 = cte (3.3)\n\nAfter some algebraic manipulation, regarding ? (t) = A exp [j (?t + ?)] with j2 = ?1,\n? (z) = B cos (kz) + C sin (kz) and boundary conditions u (0, t) = u (L,t) = 0, leading to\nB = 0, the solution 3.3 takes form of a infinite series given by:\n\nu (z,t) =\n??\nn=1\n\nDnR\n[\nej(?nt+?n)\n\n]\nsin\n\n(\ni\n?\n\nL\nz\n)\n\n, where ?n = n\n?\n\nL\nc0 = n?, n = 1, 2, . . . (3.4)\n\nThe Pythagorean harmonic series aforementioned is given in eq. 3.4 as a natural\n\nresult, ?n = n?. In addition, it is also evaluated the eigenfunction for each modal shape,\n?n (z) = sin (n?z/L). In practical methods, the infinite sum presented on eq. 3.4 will\nbecome finite, being truncated some high-harmonic, N ? N; see eq. 3.5.\n\nu (z,t) =\nN?\nn=1\n\nDnR\n[\nej(?nt+?n)\n\n]\nsin\n\n(\nn\n?\n\nL\nz\n)\n\n, where ?n = n\n?\n\nL\nc0 = n?, i = n, 2, . . . ,N\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe equation 3.2 is a 2nd order equation in t and z, which means it would be necessary\n\n4 informations in order to evaluate all constants \u2013 Dn, ?n, An and Cn \u2013 and find the\ndynamical response of the system. Two informations were given as boundary conditions,\n\nwhich determine the coefficients An and Cn. Initial conditions are missing in order to\n\ndetermine the other two coefficients. For the present work, only the Sturm-Liouville\n\nproblem is necessary; therefore, the modal shapes (eigenfunctions), ?n, and natural\n\nfrequencies (eigenvalues), ?n, evaluated using the boundary conditions are desirable.\n\n3.1.2 Vertical string\n\nNext, it will be introduced the vertical string, a vibrating string in which the effect of\n\nits own weight causes a variable traction along its span; see Figure 3.4. Some of the\n\nassumptions made for the classical vibrating string still holds, as: constant length (even\n\nwhen deformed), flexural effects on both endings are neglected and stationary waves.\n\n2In this text, ?? refers to temporal derivatives; and ??, to space derivatives.\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 15\n\nFigure 3.4: Vertical tensioned string subjected to its own weight\n\nSimilarly to that was done before, the main idea is to start with the wave equation,\n\nsee eq. 3.1, in order to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the vertical\n\nvibrating string. Again it will be supposed a transversal displacement along the string,\n\nu (z,t), which can be decomposed into the Cartesian directions presented in Figure 3.4,\nas ~u (z,t) = ux (z,t)~? + uy (z,t)~?. The traction on the vertical string shall be presented\nas a function of the position of the string, T (z), due to the effect of its own weight; see\neq. 3.6.\n\nT (z) = T0 + ?z = T0 + \u00b5gz (3.6)\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to rewrite the wave equation, considering a non-constant\n\ntraction and, after that, the separation variable method shall be employed as well,\n\nu (z,t) = ? (z) ? (t); see eqs. 3.7\u20133.8 and Tikhonov and Samarskii (1980).\n\n\u00b5\n?2u\n\n?t2\n= T ? (z)\n\n?u\n\n?z\n+ T (z)\n\n?2u\n\n?z2\n(3.7)\n\n?? (t)\n? (t)\n\n=\nT ? (z) ?? (z) + T (z) ??? (z)\n\n\u00b5? (z)\n= ??2 (3.8)\n\nAfter some trivial algebraic manipulation, it is possible to find eq. 3.9 which is a\n\nmodified Bessel equation3. In order to reach the traditional Bessel equation, it will be\n\nnecessary to introduce two change of variables, as follows; see 3.8.\n3As said before, the main purpose is to reach the eigenvalues and the eigenfunction of the\n\n\n\n3.1.

(z) = ?? =\n?\nT0\n?\n\n+ z\n\nThe following algebraic steps will be omitted due to a tedious process of\n\ndifferentiations and substitutions that will result in eq. 3.11, a Bessel equation whose\n\nsolution is given by eq. 3.12; further discussion in Bowman (1958) and Pesce et al. (1999).\n\n??2\nd2?\n\nd??2\n+\nd?\n\nd??\n+ 4????2??2? = 0, where ??2 = ?2\n\n\u00b5\n\n?\n(3.11)\n\n? (z) = C1J0\n(\n2???? (z)\n\n)\n+ C2Y0\n\n(\n2????

It is possible\nto write the boundary conditions in matrix form, see eq. 3.13, and, ignoring the trivial\n\nanswer, it will be determined a sufficient condition given by eqs. 3.14\u20133.15.\n\n?\n?J0\n\n(\n2????

Thereby, it will be considered only\nthe function ? (z) on the analysis. For further discussion about the Sturm-Liouville problem, see H\u00f6nig\n(1978).\n\n4The requirement that ? (0) > 0 means that the traction at the bottom must never be null, T0 > 0.\nSuch deficiency of the model comes from the neglected flexural rigidity near the ends.\n\n\n\n3.1.

It is noteworthy\n\nthat the parameter ??n is related to the eigenvalues, ?n, of the problem; see eq. 3.11.

Finally, a normalized\neigenfunction, see eq. 3.18, might be presented to the vertical heavy string problem in\n\nwhich the tension on the bottom end is always positive (under traction), T0 > 0.

Another\n\nvery interesting approach was proposed by Mazzilli et al. (2014) in which the flexural\n\nrigidity is considered along the cylinder span as a \u201cdistributed load\u201d and this load is\n\napproximated by an equivalent normal force proposed in their work. Doing such a\n\ntrick, the fourth-order beam equation becomes a second-order one, resembling the\n\nBessel formulation. Mazzilli et al. (2014) approach calls the eigenfunctions obtained\n\nas quasi-Bessel modes, from which they developed asymptotic expansions, reaching a\n\nclosed analytical form for those.\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 19\n\n3.1.3 Modal decomposition\n\nModal decomposition is a powerful tool developed in late nineteenth century and early\n\ntwentieth century, with contributions from Rayleigh (1896), Ritz (1909) &amp; Galerkin\n\n(1915). Modal analysis is intimately related to musical acoustics. As it might be seen\n\nin publications of middle-late nineteenth century, musical related studies, e.g., sound\n\nphenomenology, instruments and concert hall acoustics, were very common, since\n\nscience also reflects the Zeitgeist.\n\nAt that time, analytical mechanics and the Hamilton theory of quaternions, see\n\nHamilton (1853), were well-established among scientists. Ritz (1909) showed that the\n\nmodal shape was directly linked to the minimization of a functional, being possible to\n\nanalytically determine the mode of a mechanical system. The Rayleigh-Ritz method5\n\nand the Galerkin-Ritz, see Galerkin (1915), are attempts to analyze a continuum problem\n\nfrom a discrete mesh, reducing the order of the system. Both methods are numerical\n\nand iterative, based on the search for three parameters: eigenvalues (frequencies),\n\neigenfunction (modal shapes) and damping coefficients.\n\nIn order to find any of those parameters, it is necessary to guess how the modal\n\nshape would be like. The only restriction for a function to be candidate to represent a\n\nmodal shape is to satisfy all boundary constraint. The quality of the method is defined by\n\nhow better was the modal shape function (educated) estimation.\n\nComputational methods, e.g., FEM, are based on Rayleigh-Ritz-Galerkin method\n\ninasmuch as they use a discrete mesh to discretize the continuum. The quality of a FEM\n\nanalysis is related to the number of mesh elements, because they try to use as simple as\n\npossible polynomial functions to interpolate the continuum behavior: with a more refined\n\nmesh, the result will be better. There is a computational cost discussion that should be\n\nregarded, but it is not the main subject of the present work.\n\nExperimental analysis commonly uses modal techniques, trying to reduce the order\n\nof a continuum system into a finite number of dof discrete system. Ewins (2000) is a\n\nmasterpiece for experimental modal analysis, showing the fundamental points to perform\n\na good experimental test and a posterior analysis.\n\nThe experimental data collected in LIFE&amp;MO (2012d) used a model in which discrete\n\noptical targets were fixed. The optical tracking system, Qualys R\u00a9, recorded displacement\n\ndata from 43 discrete points of the tested model elastica. As it has been said, the\n\nphenomenon observed is complex, with many nuances and different response types,\n\nso that it is nearly impossible to extract much information when it is necessary to analyze\n\n43 temporal series in parallel. An interesting manner to filter the data, minimizing the loss\n\n5In a recent article, Leissa (2005) discuss that, in fact, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is strictly Ritz\nmethod. The Ritz method is similar to Rayleigh method \u2013 both minimize an energy functional \u2013 but they\nare different one from another. The aforementioned article has promoted a discussion on the same\nJournal years later, see Ilanko (2009), with some other considerations about the historical analysis of\nRayleigh-Ritz method.\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 20\n\nof information, is changing the analysis point of view from the physical model to a modal\n\nmodel.\n\nThe continuum model has infinite modes, it has infinite dof. As much as the tested\n\nmodel is continuum, it was necessary to fix discrete targets on it, then what really exists\n\nis a finite number of dof from which it is possible to interpolate an elastica at each time\n\ninstant. Therefore, with the data obtained, it would be possible to study the same finite\n\nnumber of modes. Would it be necessary to regard all 43 modes?\n\nThe answer is clearly negative, because it is possible to create a criteria of choosing\n\nonly the most significant modes. A significant mode would present non-negligible\n\namplitudes (or energy), which can be verified by a spectral analysis, such as FFT; see\n\nFigure 3.6. Another way to check if a certain amount of modes is sufficient to represent\n\nthe whole model dynamics is comparing the elastica from the modal reconstitution with\n\nthe experimental at each time increment.\n\nFigure 3.6: Free-decay test in water on the experimental model. Power spectrum of the transversal\nmovement amplitude along the model spanwise.\n\nSource: Extracted from LIFE&amp;MO (2012d).\n\nFigure 3.6 shows that the structure keeps the main energy introduced in it at the first\n\nthree modes. It would be needed a similar analysis to every experimental test, with\n\nVIV, imposed heave, concomitant VIV and heave, to conclude if only those modes are\n\nsufficient to represent the model dynamics. However an educated estimation would be\n\nthat it is not many more modes than those, perhaps some mode should be included, but\n\nthe first three should probably not be excluded. Another interesting thing can be seen\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 21\n\nfrom Figure 3.6 is that the experimental mode is very similar to sine and Bessel modes\n\ndiscussed earlier. In special, it resembles the Bessel mode asymmetry.\n\nRegarding the continuum hypothesis, any solution, u (z,t), for the vertical flexible\ncylinder elastica shall also be continuous and have continuous derivatives. It will be\n\nrequired that the solution is in a subset of Hilbert space, ? ? H2(R). There is a norm\ndefined on ?, such as:\n\n?u? = ?u,u?1/2 ,?u ? ? (3.19)\n\nIn which? \u00b7 , \u00b7? represents an inner product still to be defined. Using the separation of\nvariables method, it is considered that any vector, u\u02dc (z,t) ? ?, can be decomposed as:\n\nu\u02dc (z,t) = ?\u02dc (z) ? (t) = A (t) ?\u02dc (z) (3.20)\nIn which ? (t) = A (t) is the amplitude temporal series. Thereby, the modal\n\ndecomposition is defined as a projection of the elastica displacement, u\u02dc (z,t), at each\ninstant of time to a finite base formed with chosen modal shapes, {?? (z)}; see eqs.\n3.21\u20133.24.\n\n{\n?\u02dc (z)\n\n}\n=\n{\n?\u02dc1 (z) ,?\u02dc2 (z) , . . . ,?\u02dcN (z)\n\n}\n(3.21)\n\nu\u02dc (z,t) =\nN?\nn=1\n\nAn (t) ?\u02dcn (z) = A\nn (t) ?\u02dcn (z) (3.22)\n\nAn (t) = proj?\u02dcnu (z,t) =\n?\nu (z,t) ,?\u02dcn (z)\n\n?\n?\n?\u02dcn (z) ,?\u02dcn (z)\n\n? (3.23)\n\n?u,v? =\n? L\n\n0\nw (z) u (z) v (z) dz,?(u,v) ? ? \u00d7 ? (3.24)\n\nThe inner product6 is the typical function space inner product with a weighting\n\nfunction, w (z). The weighting function is considered to show some versatility of the\n\n6If the normalized length, z?, is used, the inner product will be rewritten considering the Jacobian of\nthe variable transformation, ?J (z, z?)?:\n\n\n\n3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 22\n\nmethod, although it is usual to choose a unitary weight. In the case of Bessel functions,\n\nthe natural weighting function would be w (z) = z, as it can be seen in Bowman (1958)\n&amp; Abramowitz and Stegun (1972). A suitable choice of an inner product can simplify\n\nanalytical expressions. However, in the modal decomposition case, all calculations will\n\nbe performed numerically, so it is not necessary to choose a natural weighting function.\n\nThe last, but not the least, point to be discussed is about the Galerkin method and\n\nthe experimental tests with imposed heave motion. As it was mentioned before, the\n\nsufficient condition on Galerkin decomposition is to use a function which does not violate\n\nthe systems constraint, a condition that resembles the analytical mechanics concept of\n\nvirtual displacement, e.g., ?u.\n\nThe modal representation base, {?? (z)}, see eq. 3.21, is chosen to be only a vector\nof the spanwise curved; being a fixed base for every time instant, it is time-invariant.\n\nAccordingly, it has emerged a dichotomy: is it possible to use such modal base to analyze\n\nexperimental tests in which occur heave motion?\n\nHeave motion simulates the effects of floating units in which a real riser might be fixed\n\nand those effects are crucial on riser dynamics, inasmuch as they represent external\n\nforces that may act on internal and parametric resonances. Trigonometric and Bessel-like\n\nmodes use a fixed model length, L, in their closed-form solution. On the other hand, there\n\nis an elongation in heave tests in which the length becomes a function of time. Therefore,\n\nit would be possible to obtain a time-variant modal base.\n\nIn order to project in a time-invariant modal base, it is necessary to choose a length\n\nmean value. Galerkin\u2019s method is still valid, as the longitudinal displacement varies, the\n\ntransversal does not violates the system constrains. Mazzilli et al. (2014) presents a\n\nclosed-form solution for modes in which the elongation is considered and it is expected\n\nthat the quality of a quasi-Bessel projection for a heave test should be better than a\n\ntrigonometric ou Bessel-like.\n\nIn fact, the Rayleigh quotient might help to justify the use of the time-invariant base\n\non the imposed heave tests. By choosing any close-to-the-mode function, the iterative\n\nmethod will present an error of second-order on the eigenvalue. Therefore, the error\n\ncaused on the analysis using the time-invariant base with 1% of model length heave\nmotion should not have any significant effect on the temporal modal amplitude series\n\nobtained.\n\n?u,v? =\n?

MODAL OSCILLATOR 23\n\n3.2 Modal oscillator\n\nThe following section is devoted to propose a modal oscillator, based on a continuum\n\nmodel, T (z,t). On the other hand, the heave will be considered as an axial tension\nmodulation of the model. A damping term proportional to the velocity, csu?\u02dc, is considered\nas an approximation of a viscous structural damping and a damping term proportional\n\nquadratically in the velocity (hydrodynamical drag force \u2013 Morisson\u2019s drag) is also present\n\non the continuum model.\n\n3.2.1 Mathematical formulation from the continuum\n\nThe continuum mathematical formulation is made from a wave equation with damping\n\nterms, considering the added mass effect; see eq. 3.25, Tikhonov and Samarskii (1980).\n\n(\u00b5 + ma)\n?2u\u02dc\n?t2\n\n+ cs\n?u\u02dc\n?t\n\n+\n1\n2\n?wDCD\n\n?u\u02dc\n?t\n\n??????u\u02dc?t\n????? = ??z\n\n(\nT (z,t)\n\n?u\u02dc\n?z\n\n)\n(3.25)\n\nThe tension term is defined in eq. 3.26 in which Tt = T (z = L) is the tension at\nthe experimental top, At; the heave motion amplitude; and ?t, the imposed movement\n\nfrequency (in rad/s). As presented in Table 4.3, EA is the axial stiffness of the\nexperimental model (as built), the traction modulation is evaluated based on a simply\n\nrod model in which EA/L would represent an equivalent spring constant.\n\nT (z,t) = Tt ??

As it has\n\nbeen already mentioned, the present work is a direct consequence from the R&amp;D project\n\n\u201cNon-Linear Dynamics of Risers: non-linear interactions of hydro-elastic and contact\n\nnature\u201d, sponsored by Petrobras; see the preface on pg. xxi for further acknowledgments.\n\n4.1.1 Froude similitude\n\nIn order to perform the experimental tests, it was developed a similitude algorithm in order\n\nto represent a regular 8in diameter Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) as a small-scale model,\nfor laboratory practical uses. After some analysis, a collection of dimensionless control\n\nparameters was proposed to analyse the non-linear dynamics of risers (on still water),\n\nincluding non-linearities of geometric, hydro-elastic and contact nature; see Table 4.1.\n\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to reach a model in which both Reynolds (Re) and Froude\n\n(Fr) similarities are satisfied. Thereby, the Froude scale was chosen in order to simulate\n\nthe dynamical load due to vertical motions imposed at the top of the riser, mainly caused\n\nby the effect of gravity waves on the floating structure to which the riser is fixed.\n\n\n\n4.1.

The scale\n\nchosen was ?Fr = 1 : 100 which leads to non-practical external diameter order of about\nO = 2mm. The solution proposed by Pereira et al. (2012) was to increase the external\ndiameter, keeping constant three physical quantities from the scaled-model; they are:\n\ni. Axial stiffness: EA;\n\nii. Flexural length: ?f ;\n\niii. Added mass coefficient: Ca or a.\n\nIn order to achieve such small-scale model, it was used an iterative algorithm in which\n\nthe external and internal diameters of a silicon tube were given as known and the method\n\nwould evaluate what would be the necessary model density.\n\nTable 4.2: Quantities feautures and Froude similarity.\n\nQuantity Physical dimension Scale\n\nLength L ?Fr\nMass M ?M\n\n?\n(?Fr)\n\n3\n\nTime T (?Fr)\n1/2\n\nSource: Extracted from Pereira et al.

The silicon tube chosen presented a viscous-elastic rheological\n\nbehavior, see Figure 4.2, something that was not expected a priori, since the majority of\n\nexperimental models in this field are considered to be linear-elastic.\n\nFigure 4.2: Viscous-elastic behavior of experimental model under cyclic tension test. Maximum\nengineering deformation of ? ? 0.1% at f = 1.5Hz.\n\nAs much as the small-scale model aims at an operational riser, they will not establish\n\na full similarity to each other, inasmuch as it is impossible to match the Re using the\n\nFroude scale adopted. If the total length of the small-scale model tested is considered,\n\nL = 2602mm, see Table 4.4, which would be equivalent to a depth of approximately\n? 260m on the ocean. It would not be considered as very deep waters. Such details would\ncause a raid in some readers who would argue that the model does not represent a SCR,\n\nconsequently a flexible vertical riser, and, in fact, the model does not; at least not strictly.\n\nNevertheless, the small-scale model is as close as possible of a real riser, providing\n\nexperimental results at a laboratory facility that could even be used as benchmarking\n\nfor other analytical, semi-analytical or numerical models. Thereby, in order to be more\n\nconsistent, it will be understood from now on that the present work is focused on the\n\ndynamics of a flexible vertical cylinder, which was designed and built inspired in a real\n\nriser with a good degree of the Froude similitude linking them.\n\n\n\n4.1.

The vertical model was assembled at the NDF water channel\n\nand some preliminary experimental analyses were made at that time. A preparation for\n\nthe experimental set-up that would be mounted on the Towing Tank from IPT.\n\nRegarding now the experimental set-up at IPT facility, it is necessary identify some\n\nbasic general data about the methodology used. First, using the previous analyses made\n\nwith the model at NDF and TPN facilities, it was determined that the phenomena studied\n\nwould concentrate their frequency spectra within a range between 0.5Hz up-tp 6.0Hz.\nOverestimating the sampling frequency, it was chosen the value of Fs = 60Hz, which it is\nnot the best suitable choice, since the electric power supply has the same frequency, the\n\nmultiplicity by 1/3 might promote some truncate error on numerical algorithms and the\nnext power-of-two number is very close.\n\nFor the purpose of measuring the elastica dynamics, it was used an optical tracking\n\nsystem, by Qualisys\nTM\n\n, which captures the displacement of each discrete optical target\n\nattached to the experimental model. Two aerial cameras were used to measure the\n\nelastica displacement of the above water model segment, and more 6 submerged\ncameras in order to capture the elastica under water; see Figures 4.3\u20134.4. Besides, it\n\nis possible to mention that the accuracy of the optical system is about \u00b10.1mm. The\nrelative flow around the model was created by the moving towing tank carriage, with the\n\nvelocity controlled.\n\n\n\n4.1. EXPERIMENTS IN WATER 32\n\nFigure 4.3: Vertical model.

The text will be organized on\n\nfour sections which are dedicated to:\n\n1. Modal representation;\n\n2. Imposed heave and modal Mathieu instability;\n\n3. Experimental tests with flexible vertical cylinder in air:\n\n(a) Free-Decay test and structural damping;\n\n(b) Comparison to tests in water in order to estimate modal hydrodynamic\n\ncoefficients.\n\n5.1 Modal representation\n\nPreviously, two simplified mathematical models have been presented which lead to\n\ntwo different eigenfunction bases: the classical vibrating string and the vertical string,\n\nreaching trigonometric and Bessel-type modes, respectively. Which modal base\n\nrepresents the experimental elastica better?\n\n5.1.1 Imposed heave motion at the top\n\nIn this section, the effects of imposed heave on the structural dynamics will be analysed.\n\nThe following cases will be considered:\n\ni. ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1;\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 40\n\nii. ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1;\n\niii. ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1.\n\nInitially, observing the heave imposed at ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1, see Figure 5.1a\u2013b, it is\npossible to regard some interesting phenomena.\n\nFigure 5.1: Scalograms of imposed heave \u2013 ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1.\n\n(a) Scalogram of x? displacement. (b) Scalogram of y? displacement.\n\nSource: Extracted from LIFE&amp;MO (2012d)\n\nKeeping in mind it is a heave test, it could be asked why there is a difference between\n\ndirections x and y, inasmuch as the cylinder has a circular section. Considering now the\n\nPSD of the in-line motion, the one in which occurred the travelling wave, see Figure 5.2,\n\nshows that there is a main frequency on the response and the following harmonics are\n\npresent, but with less energy. It is interesting to think the experimental model is similar to\n\na piano/harp string which presents a proper energy distribution on each harmonic, as the\n\nexperimental apparatus has its own timbre.\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 41\n\nFigure 5.2: PSD of imposed heave \u2013 ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1.\n\nSource: Extracted from LIFE&amp;MO (2012d)\n\nFollowing, it shall be considered the case in which ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1. The PSD of the\nin-line direction, see Figure 5.3, shows a monochromatic response, all energy within the\n\nthird mode. The harmonic series should also appear, however, if the third harmonic is\n\nconsidered as fundamental, the next frequency would be twice its value, thus, the sixth\n\nmode. The sixth mode has little energy on it and it was not considered on the PSD plot.\n\nIs is also not observed any super-harmonic.\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 42\n\nFigure 5.3: PSD of imposed heave \u2013 ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1.\n\nSource: Extracted from LIFE&amp;MO (2012d)\n\nThe case ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 was left to be presented last on purpose, inasmuch as\nsomething really beautiful appears: Mathieu instability.\n\nFigures 5.4a\u2013d show much information about the model dynamics. The first\n\nphenomenon that calls attention is the \u201cfork pattern\u201d that can be seen on Figure 5.4a.\n\nThe fork pattern indicates a Mathieu instability at the lower half of the model. Although\n\nthe Mathieu instability occurs in the whole model,it appeared more visually in 5.4a at the\n\nlower half of the model.\n\nHereupon, whether it is considered the PSD of the crossflow motion plane, see\n\nFigure 5.4d, it might be seen a high energy peak in the second harmonic, but it is\n\nalso possible to identify a weak energy peak of the fundamental mode. There is no\n\ncoincidence and that might be seen regarding the PSD of the in-line direction, Figure 5.4c,\n\nwhere the fundamental mode is the high energy peak, followed by the second harmonic.\n\nThis shows that the modes are linked to each other, being able to transfer energy from\n\none to the other.\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 43\n\nFigure 5.4: Scalograms and PSD spectra from imposed heave \u2013 ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1.\n\n(a) Scalogram of x? displacement. (b) Scalogram of y? displacement.\n\n(c) PSD of x?. (d) PSD of y?.\n\nSource: Extracted from LIFE&amp;MO (2012d)\n\nConsidering imposed heave, there was not any frequency above the third mode that\n\ncould be seen in Figures 5.2, 5.3 &amp; 5.4c\u2013d. If it is considered only phenomena related\n\nto heave, as shown, there is no necessity to use more than three modes to represent\n\nsuccessfully the experimental elastica and there is a huge gain of analysis improvement,\n\ninasmuch as it is no longer necessary to analyse 43 temporal series in parallel, being\nsufficient only 3 up-to 4 modal temporal series to represent the same amount of dynamical\ninformation.\n\nOne final question remains about the modal representation: which modal\n\neigenfunctions bases should be used in order to achieve a reliable result? According to\n\nwhat was discussed previously, the only requirement an eigenfunction base shall present\n\nis related to the Galerkin condition.\n\nIn Figure 5.5, it may be seen two different experimental data on the legend:\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 44\n\n1. Experimental (Exp.);\n\n2. Experimental filtered (Exp. filt.).\n\nThe one called \u201cexperimental\u201d refers to data without any pre-processing signal\n\nanalysis, such as, filtering and windowing; the other data was processed using a\n\nband-pass filter, in order to give it a smoother aspect. In the end, the filtered data was not\n\nnecessary, because the experimental data did not introduced much numerical error on\n\nthe modal decomposition method.\n\nVisually, the two modal bases are equivalent, but which one is more suitable? The\n\nanswer is both are equivalently suitable. The argument to verify the equivalence comes\n\nfrom the Galerkin method. It is only necessary to a set of functions does not violate\n\nkinematical constrains in order to be a good base choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the sine base has shown to be a better modal decomposition\n\nchoice for eigenvalues due to its simplicity. The Bessel-type eigenfunction requires the\n\nnumerical solution of eq. 3.14, in order to determine the eigenvalue by the transcendental\n\nequation and, then, to obtain the modal shapes. On the other hand, the sine base does\n\nnot require any of this, being much simpler to use numerically and analytically.\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 45\n\nFigure 5.5: Modal representation using three harmonics. Experimental data and Bessel-type\neigenfunction base. VIV \u2013 VR,1 = 6.00.\n\n(a) x? displacement.\n\n(b) y? displacement.\n\nThe number of modes considered in which decomposition is related to how simpler the\n\nmode is. Sine modes are the simplest and they require a major number of harmonics in\n\norder to represent satisfactorily the elastica dynamics recomposition. More sophisticated\n\nmodes as quasi-Bessel approach, see Mazzilli et al. (2014), have a closed-form solution\n\n\n\n5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 46\n\nthat may be able to reduce the total number of harmonics. A non-linear mode would\n\nreduce the harmonic number even more. A small number of harmonics is desirable in\n\norder to obtain Reduced Order Models (ROMs) as compact as it is possible.\n\nHereupon, only the trigonometric base will be considered in modal analysis. It might\n\nbe prudent testing the minimal number of harmonics, 3 up-to 4, suggested before is\nsufficient.\n\nFor the sake of imposed heave, it can be remarked 3 harmonics are sufficient to\nrepresent the ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 case; see eq. 5.6. Despite the fact ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 case is\nnot shown, it was also well-represented by only 3 harmonics.\n\nFigure 5.6: Modal representation using three harmonics.

Whether the 3 harmonics representation is regarded, Figure 5.7, it will be\nseen that it is quite not as good as the others previously mentioned. Actually, in this\n\nparticular case, the four harmonics modal decomposition is more suitable, reaching a\n\nvery satisfying result; see Figure 5.8.\n\n\n\n5.1.

If it was used,\n\ne.g. quasi-Bessel modes, the total amount of harmonic could be less than four.\n\n\n\n5.2. FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 48\n\nFinally, the modal decomposition used might be summed-up as:\n\ni. Sine modal eigenfunctions;\n\nii. Number of harmonics to be used: 3 up-to 4.\n\n5.2 Free-Decay Test in air\n\nUsing a free-decay test in air, it is possible to isolate the effect caused from structural\n\ndamping, since it is possible to neglect drag force due to the air. The modal structural\n\ndamping coefficients will be the first result that follows. Then, it is evaluated the modal\n\nadded mass coefficient for the experiment in water, relating it with the experiment in air.\n\nThere are three different experimental tests that consist the free decay in air, called:\n\nTest 4; Test 5; and Test 6. The difference among them are simply the position in the\n\nmodel spanwise in which the initial impulse was given. Figure 5.9 shows schematically\n\nthe impulse position in each test.\n\nFigure 5.9: Free-Decay Test \u2013 Initial impulse position along spanwise.

Such behavior\n\nis confirmed analyzing the amplitude spectra1of all tests, see Figure 5.12\u20135.14, in which\n\nthe power is evaluated in dB, showing that the great majority of energy is confined in the\n\nfirst mode, being necessary to decay almost two decades to reach the energy levels of\n\nsecond and third modes.\n\n1The amplitude spectrum was obtained using the Hilbert-Huang transform; see Gon\u00e7alves et al.\n(2012) for more details of the technique.\n\n\n\n5.2.

FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 53\n\nFigure 5.15 shows that the first mode behaves very smoothly, but the second and third\n\nmodes show evidences of being polichromatic. Besides, the movement is larger in the Y\n\ndirection, as the free-decay impulse was given in that direction.\n\nNow considering only de Y direction movement and looking more closely to the\n\nmodal series, Figures 5.16\u20135.27 show that the chosen modal decomposition using a\n\ntrigonometric base produces a modal amplitude series that is not monochromatic. The\n\namplitude spectrogram shown in Figures 5.16\u20135.27 were obtained by creating a classic\n\nFFT spectrum of each one and, by windowing samples, one-by-one. In order to evaluate\n\nthe FFT in each sample, a Kaiser window was used, so the spectra information is centered\n\nin the middle of the sample. The energy within each frequency in the amplitude spectrum\n\nis given in dB/Hz.\n\nUsing Test 4 as an example, Figures 5.17, 5.19 and 5.21 bring attention to some\n\ninteresting aspects of each modal amplitude series. The first mode is essentially\n\nmonochromatic and it is a general decaying response, as aforementioned when the\n\nFigure5.15 was presented. The next modes do not have the same fortune, needing\n\nmore attention.\n\nThe second mode has a composition of frequencies in which the dominant response\n\nhas the frequency of the first mode. The damping effect of each mode appears to increase\n\nwith the number mode, inasmuch as the higher modes seems to decay faster than the\n\nfirst. In order to estimate the damping coefficient of any mode, the initial signal interval\n\nis necessary, but that is the region where the mixture of harmonics causes a unsuitable\n\nsignal behavior to be analyzed.\n\nA simple band-pass filter was applied in the signal FFT spectrum, trying to reach a\n\nmodal series suitable for the decaying analysis. The second mode is filtered as shown in\n\nFigure 5.19 and the filtered temporal series is simply evaluated with the inverse FFT. The\n\nresult obtained is not close to the original signal and it leaded to a damping coefficient\n\nthat needs to be analyzed together with the damping coefficient obtained with the other\n\ntests.\n\nWhen the same procedure is used with the third mode, see Figure 5.21, the\n\nreconstructed signal is very close to the original, providing a damping coefficient more\n\nsuitable.\n\nTable 5.1 presents a summary of all damping coefficients and natural frequencies\n\nestimates using data from Figures 5.18, 5.20, 5.22, 5.24\u20135.26, 5.28\u20135.30. Adopting\n\na visual criteria when comparing the reconstructed filtered signal in time domain, the\n\nmore suitable results considered to be valid are emphasized in Table 5.1 and the mean\n\nvalues of modal structural linear damping coefficients and natural frequencies are given\n\nin Table 5.2.\n\n\n\n5.2.

FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 64\n\n5.2.2 Modal Added Mass\n\nResetting the added mass parameter has a direct influence on the eigenvalues of the\n\nsystem. Moreover, the buoyancy effect changes the immersed weight of the model, also\n\nchanging some modal parameters, e.g., modal rigidity; see eq. 3.30.\n\nIt will be considered that the fundamental link between the model immersed in water\n\nand the other in air is their geometric rigidity. Using eq. 3.30 notation:\n\n?nw = ?nair (5.1)\n\nConsidering only the sine eigenfunction, setting the weight function of the inner\n\nproduct to be unitary, w (z) = 1; see eq. 3.24, Equation 5.1 can be stated as:\n\n?nw =\n? L\n\n0\n{?i?n,z + [Ttw ??i (L?z)] ?n,zz}?ndz =\n\n=\n? L\n\n0\n{??n,z + [Ttair ?? (L?z)] ?n,zz}?ndz = ?nair (5.2)\n\nUsing now the eigenfunction definition, ?n (z) = sin (n?z/L), and evaluating its first\nand second derivative, it is possible to perform the integral in eq. 5.2 analytically, reaching\n\nthe following result shown in Table 5.3.\n\nTable 5.3: Modal parameters eq. 3.30 analytical expressions, using sine eigenfunction base.\n\nParameter Symbol Analytical expression\n\nModal mass Mn\n(\u00b5+ma)L\n\n2\n\nModal rigidity ?n\n(\nn?\n2\n\n)2 (2Tt\nL\n??\n\n)\n\nModal rigidity (modulation) ?n\n(\nn?\n2\n\n)2 (\nEA\nL0\n\n)\n2At\nL\n\nBy definition, the immersed weight (per unit of length) is the structural weight\n\ndecreased of the buoyancy effect, thus: ?i = (\u00b5???wD2/4) g and ? = \u00b5g. Finally,\ntogether with eq. 5.3, it is possible to find the value of the traction at the top of the model\n\nwhich sets the same axial rigidity for both environments; see eq. 5.4.\n\n2Ttair\nL\n?? =\n\n2Ttw\nL\n??i ?

The mean value of the tension is T = 47.36N, being very\nclose to the predicted value; see eq.5.5.\n\nFigure 5.31: Free-Decay Test \u2013 Tension imposed at the top.\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nt[s]\n\nT\nt\n[N\n\n]\n\nTable 5.4 shows numerical values of axial stiffness for both experimental set-ups in\n\nwater and in air. The axial rigidity equivalence is shown evaluating the parameter in both\n\ncases and noting that they are equivalent mode by mode.\n\n2In fact, given the elastic behavior of the material, the solution is iterative, since the model will stretch\nwhen solicited.\n\n\n\n5.2.

The first is quite immediate that the added\n\nmass an increases with higher modes. On the other hand, the added mass a?n decreases.\n\nBoth approaches lead to an equivalent result for the first mode, but the discrepancy of\n\nothers results only increases higher the next mode is. The coefficient order is the same\n\nin both methods.\n\nConsidering the experiments presented in Sarpkaya (1977) with a rigid\n\ncylinder in a constant oscillatory flow, non-dimension numbers as Reynolds (Re),\n\n\n\n5.2. FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 68\n\nKeulegan-Carpenter (KC) and the frequency parameter (?KC)3give a hint of what should\n\nbe obtained for added mass coefficient and drag coefficient.\n4\n\nThe free-decay test is non-stationary, so it is outside the experiments described in\n\nSarpkaya (1977). On the other hand, the free-decay is asymptotic to the trivial equilibrium\n\nresponse and there is a possibility to find a initial range of the inertial coefficient in order\n\nto inspect consistency with respect to the results shown in Table 5.5.\n\nFigure 5.32: Hydrodynamics coefficients vs. Keulegan-Carpenter number for constant values of the\nfrequency parameter and Reynolds number\n\n(a) Drag coefficient, Cd\n\n(b) Inertia coefficient, Cm = Ca + 1\nSource: Extracted from Sarpkaya (1977).\n\n4In Figures 5.32a\u2013b, ?KC is called ?.

Choosing a modal amplitude of\n\napproximately Ay1/D = 0.05 and Ay1/D = 0.04, the KC number order is less than the\nunity (O (KC) = 10?1). Looking at Figure 5.32, the Cm curve is asymptotic near 2 to low\nKC number and all Re range considered. The inertia coefficient indicates that CaN ? 1\nfor both modes (Cm = Ca + 1).\n\n\n\n5.2.

In fact, the added mass evaluated from both experimental\n\napproaches are greater than the unity suggested by Sarpkaya (1977). Nevertheless,\n\nPesce and Fujarra (2000) have also found an added mass value for a flexible cantilever\n\ngreater than the unity (Ca,1 = 1.17). Thorsen et al. (2016), analyzing experimental data of\na flexible cylinder subjected to an oscillatory flow presented by Fu et al. (2014), also found\n\nadded mass coefficient value greater than the unity (Ca = 1.53). It should be recalled that\nthe Sarpkaya charts were obtained for rigid cylinders under oscillatory flow, not for flexible\n\ncylinders.\n\n\n\n5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 71\n\n5.3 Parametric resonance and Mathieu instability\n\nThis section is dedicated to explore the possibility to occur a modal Mathieu instability\n\ndue to imposed heave motion. Mathieu instability is caused by a bifurcation on the\n\ndynamical system, in which the stable center turns into unstable focus with a limit cycle\n\n(Hopf bifurcation) for the trivial solution.\n\nThe Strutt diagram relates the Mathieu oscillator parameters, see eqs. 3.32\u20133.33, into\n\na chart-guide which can predict whether the system will be on a stable or unstable region\n\nfor the trivial solution. The Strutt diagram is determined by a linear oscillator, with or\n\nwithout an equivalent damping term. However what would be the effects of considering\n\na non-linear oscillator with a quadratically damping term, as the hydrodynamic drag?\n\nThis question might be answered by parts, using local pertubation techniques.\n\nRamani et al. (2004) presented an approach in which, by considering the quadratically\n\ndamping term, the Strutt diagram shows a second bifurcation, see Figure 5.34,\n\ndetermined by the red line. This line is evaluated using a local perturbation method and\n\nthe bifurcation line is better defined when closer to the point P. The point P is determined\n\nin the critical point where the derivative change its signal in the Strutt diagram first stability\n\ntongue.\n\n\n\n5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 72\n\nFigure 5.34: Second bifurcation on Strutt diagram by introducing a quadratically damping term.\n\nSource: Adapted from Ramani et al. (2004), Franzini et al. (2014) &amp; Franzini et al. (2015).\n\nThe modal oscillator presented in Ramani et al. (2004) uses ?? =\n(\n?N\n?t\n\n)2\n. The\n\ndifference between ?? and ? defined in eq. 3.32 is a factor of four, leading to a Strutt chart\n\nequivalent, however in a different scale.\n\nThe \u201ccorrection\u201d provided by the method is interesting, inasmuch as, for a linear\n\nsystem, whether it is located in the area above the second bifurcation line, but outside\n\nthe tongues, the Strutt diagram would predict a stable behavior for the trivial solution;\n\ninstead, the quadratically damping term causes the same region to be unstable.\n\nConsidering the Mathieu-Hill oscillator in eq. 3.33, the Strutt diagram seen in fig.\n\n5.35 shows that the bifurcation occurs every time the system leaves the dashed area.\n\nConsidering the tongue tips at the line ? = 0, it is possible to determine the relation\nbetween driven frequency and natural frequency necessary to leads the system into a\n\nMathieu instability analyzing the oscillator ?-parameter.\n\n\n\n5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 73\n\nFigure 5.35: Strutt diagram of classical undamped Mathieu-Hill oscillator.\n\nThe Mathieu instability occurs every time the following relation is given:\n\n?n =\n(2?N,1\n\n?t\n\n)2\n= k2 with k ?

In ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 and ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 cases, whether the trivial\nsolution becomes unstable, it will be caused by a Mathieu instability; otherwise any other\n\ninstability can not be Mathieu-type. The modal Strutt diagrams for the flexible vertical\n\ncylinder in water can be seen in fig. 5.36.\n\n\n\n5.3.

PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 75\n\nConsidering the first mode, the reader can identify the blue square data (ft : fN,1 = 3 :\n1) in Fig. 5.36a. Only the red square (ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1) and green square (ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1)\nare to be considered as Mathieu instability if they are inside a unstable region. A close look\n\ncan assure that both points are inside a unstable region. Therefore the trivial solutions for\n\nfirst mode in the ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 and ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 parametric excitation are unstable.\nThe second mode eigenfrequency ?N,2 ? 2?N,1, inasmuch as the model in water\n\nholds the Pythagorean harmonic series. In that case only there is only one Mathieu\n\ninstability due to the ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 that corresponds to the ft : fN,2 = 2 : 2; the green\nsquare in Figure 5.36b.\n\nThe same procedure for the third mode leads to ?N,3 ? 3?N,1 and, among the driven\nfrequencies, only ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft : fN,3 = 3 : 3) and ft : fn,1 = 2 : 1 (ft : fN,3 = 2 : 3)\nare Mathieu instabilities of the trivial solution; respectively, the blue square and green\n\nsquare in Figure 5.36c.\n\nThe results obtained with the Strutt diagram is summed up in Table 5.6. Those results\n\nobtained are consistent with the power spectra shown in Figures 5.2, 5.3, 5.4c\u2013d where\n\nthe trivial solution is unstable and the system finds another periodic solution for each\n\nmode. The composition of modes provides scalograms as shown in Figures 5.4a\u2013b in\n\nwhich the coexistence of more than one mode in the elastica dynamics can be verified.\n\nTable 5.6: Modal Strutt diagram stability of the trivial solution for experiments in water\n\nn\nft/fN,n\n\n1 : 1 2 : 1 3 : 1\n1 Unstable Unstable Stable\n2 Stable Unstable Stable\n3 Stable Unstable Unstable\n\nIntroducing Reduce Order Models (ROMs) similar to the ROM described in eq. 3.32,\n\nFranzini et al. (2015) has reached to numerical simulations of each mode, as seen in\n\nFigures 5.37\u20135.39; see Table 5.7.\n\nTable 5.7: Parameters of Mathieu-Hill oscillators (ROMs) studied in Franzini et al.

Furthermore,\n\n\n\n5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 76\n\nmultifrequency response composed of subharmonics are also found, a result that the\n\nStrutt diagrams could not anticipate. Quoting Franzini et al. (2015):\n\nAnother interesting finding is that, whenever the Strutt diagram\n\ndid not clearly predict a single periodic solution for a given\n\nmode, the spectral analysis revealed a multifrequency response\n\nin that mode. In other words, periodic solutions emerging\n\nfrom Mathieu-like instabilities appear to dominate other possible\n\nharmonic components in a given mode. (FRANZINI ET AL., 2015,\n\np. 11).\n\nIn the first mode, see Figure 5.37, there are periodic solutions for ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 and\nft/fN,1 = 2 : 1, as predicted in Table 5.6. Also as expected by Strutt diagram analysis,\nthe ft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 is stable.\n\nThe second mode is a little more interesting as there is a subharmonic response,\n\nsee Figure 5.38. There are periodic solutions for ft/fN,1 = 2 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 2 : 2) and\nft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 3 : 2) as also predicted by the Strutt diagram. In addition,\nthere is a quasi-periodic solution for ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 1 : 2) in which the power\nspectrum shows a composition of the harmonic fr/fN,2 = 2 : 2 with a subharmonic\nfr/fN,2 = 1/2.\n\nFigure 5.39 shows results for the third mode. By Strutt diagram analysis, the ft/fN,1 =\n2 : 1 (ft/fN,3 = 2 : 3) and ft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft/fN,1 = 3 : 3) trivial solutions are known to\nbe unstable. Besides, subharmonics fr/fN,3 = 1/3 and fr/fN,3 = 2/3 can be seen\nin the ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 case; and a subharmonic fr/fN,3 = 4/3 is associated with the\nft/fN,3 = 2 : 3 in the response of ft/fN,1 = 2 : 1.\n\nThe results obtained using Strutt diagram analysis and the spectral analysis of ROMs\n\nresponse are summarized in Table 5.8.\n\n\n\n5.3.

The results obtained by using the trigonometric base\n\nwere both satisfactory in the experiments in water and in air.\n\nThe experimental test conducted in air provided, successfully, modal structural\n\ndamping, when subjected to a free-decay test. The modal damping coefficients are\n\nshown in Tab.5.2. These coefficients will be of importance in further analysis in order\n\nto understand how much damping is caused by the structure itself, or by the drag\n\nforce in water. Understanding the difference between structural and hydrodynamical\n\ndamping is crucial, inasmuch as the structural damping is considered to be proportional\n\ndo the relative velocity of the structure, while the hydrodynamic damping is essentially\n\nnon-linear.\n\nThe most interesting result obtained using the free-decay test in air was the evaluation\n\nof the modal added mass coefficient in still water. Such prediction is said to be in still water,\n\nsince it would be necessary a different experimental procedure to capture damping during\n\na towing-tank run, by studying transitory responses.\n\nAs discussed before, there are some important points to be considered in the added\n\nmass results. The first is the difference between the increasing (aN ) or decreasing (a?N )\n\nbehavior of added mass coefficient with increase of the mode number. Such behavior\n\ncould not be explained with the present work. Additional analysis, including numerical\n\nmodels, could be used in order to verify which of the results are more consistent. However\n\nthe first mode added mass is equivalent in both approaches used, a1 = 0.4158 ? 0.4201 =\na?1.\n\nThe second important consideration to be done about the added mass coefficient\n\nrefers to Sarpkaya (1977) results for a rigid cylinder under the effect of a oscillatory flow\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 82\n\naround it. Sarpkaya showed that the inertia coefficient has a asymptotic value (Cm =\n1 + Ca ? 2, Ca ? 1) for low KC number at any Reynolds number considered.\n\nThe added mass, Ca found in Table 5.5 is greater than the unity predicted by Sarpkaya.\n\nHowever another experiment with a flexible structure presented in Pesce and Fujarra\n\n(2000) has also shown a added mass coefficient greater than the unity. The case\n\npresented in Pesce and Fujarra (2000) is a cantilever and the added mass was evaluated\n\nusing a relation between natural frequencies in air and in water likewise performed in the\n\npresent work.\n\nThe discussion about the value of flexible cylinder added mass coefficient is not a\n\nclosed subject. In fact, the recent work by Thorsen et al. (2016), e.g., on flexible cylinders\n\nin oscillating flows, still uses Ca = 1 in its proposed empirical hydrodynamic model. The\nexperimental work by Fu et. al (2014), where a flexible cylinder is transversally excited\n\nwith sinusoidal displacements applied at the extremities, does not investigate the modal\n\nadded mass, also using Ca = 1.\nFranzini et al. (2016), using nonlinear oscillators obtained through the Galerkin\u2019s\n\nprojection technique, using sinusoidal modes, investigate the response sensitivity of the\n\nvertical flexible cylinder subjected to parametric excitation to the parameters CD and Ca,\n\nvaried within a significant interval.\n\nIn the present work the modal added mass coefficients, Ca, are larger than unity, the\n\nasymptotic limit when KC goes to zero for rigid cylinders subjected to oscillatory flows;\n\nSarpkaya (1977).\n\nReasons for that are not clear at this point and could be related to the choice of\n\nthe modal basis. A more represantive basis, as that called quasi-Bessel, could lead\n\nto dinstinct results; see Dias (2015).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the methods applied in the present work to obtain\n\nthe modal added mass coefficients rely on decay tests only. Such point is essential\n\nin the definition of representative KC and Reynolds numbers, inasmuch as the amplitude\n\nvaries in the free-decay and many of the hydrodynamic coefficients are function of the\n\namplitude.\n\nParametric resonance and Mathieu instability of the heave imposed experimental\n\ntests in water were also explored in the present analysis. Strutt diagram predicted\n\nunstable trivial solutions for some modes, leading to periodic solutions. The Mathieu\n\ninstability was discussed in the previous chapter; see p. 71.\n\nNumerical results obtained with reduced-order models in Franzini et al. (2015) show\n\nthat, even in situations when the Strutt diagram does not predict instability of the trivial\n\nsolution, a response dominated by subharmonics is possible, leading the system to a\n\nnew quasi-periodical modal amplitude solution; see Table 5.8.\n\nThe presence of dominant subharmonic response in cases in which Strutt diagram did\n\nnot predict any stable periodical solution is a very interesting result found. This is closely\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 83\n\nlinked to the process of choosing a modal basis in order to decompose the movement.\n\nThe trigonometric base used has monochromatic modes and the experimental analysis\n\nindicates the presence of subharmonics, associating the structure frequency modes with\n\nthe driven frequency.\n\nIn fact, the discussion on the proper modal basis choice permeates the whole\n\nanalysis. The Galerkin criteria must hold for any Eigen function chosen and the\n\ntrigonometric modes are, in fact, the simplest possible. The finite number of modes\n\nnecessary in order to reconstruct the elastica dynamics would decrease with a better\n\nchoice of modal shapes. Quasi-Bessel modes appear as a good choice, since written in\n\na closed-form and they already including non-linear effects of curvature and elongation;\n\nsee Mazzilli et al. (2014).\n\nAs further topics of research, a few are mentioned in the following paragraphs.\n\nSimilar to the study of parametric resonance and Mathieu instability of the\n\nexperiments with imposed parametric heave in water, there is a database of experiments\n\nin air with parametric imposed heave. The difference between being immersed in water\n\nand air will be to enlarge the Strutt diagram unstable tongue regions as effect of the\n\ndamping be greater in water than in air. Such difference might bring more subharmonics\n\nto the response, or cause parametric resonance in modes that were stable in water.\n\nIt is also possible to use a non-linear Reduced Order Model (ROM) in order to evaluate\n\nthe effect of some hydrodynamical coefficients, as added mass and non-linear damping;\n\nFranzini et al. (2015) and Franzini et al. (2016). It would be interesting to compare the\n\nresults obtained using the analytical-numerical ROM with the experimental results in\n\nwater obtained with modal decomposition techniques.\n\nThe use of Floquet theory and evaluation of characteristic exponents to study the\n\nstability of trivial solution of a modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator can also provide a new\n\nmethodology to predict when the bifurcation will occur in some mode for a certain imposed\n\nheave, complementary to the use of Strutt diagram.\n\nOther possible inroad to take is using some better representation base for the modal\n\ndecomposition. The quasi-Bessel base has a closed-form solution, being very easy to be\n\nadapted to the modal decomposition algorithms. Some advantages of the quasi-Bessel\n\nmode was already mentioned, but it is very useful to point out again that those modes\n\ninherited properties of a non-linear beam model, which is more robust than any cable\n\nmodel using trigonometric ou classical Bessel modes; see Mazzilli et al. (2014).\n\nNumerical models (CFD) could be used in order to assess the added\n\nmass experimental estimates. Besides, numerical models could lead to a full\n\ncharacterization of hydrodynamics coefficients in a wide range of Reynolds number and\n\nKeulegan-Carpenter number.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 84\n\nFu et al. (2014) and Thorsen et al. (2016) present interesting results of hydrodynamic\n\nforces on a flexible cylinder. Further experiments in order to assess the inertia coefficient\n\nwould assist towards a deeper understanding of added mass results obtained in the\n\npresent work.\n\nAnother topic that may be addressed is the experimental tests with incident flow,\n\ndealing with concomitant fluid-structure phenomena, as Vortex Induced Vibration and\n\nparametric resonance. This can be carried out by analysing the enormous experimental\n\ndata base already available from the experiments at IPT; see LIFE&amp;MO (2012d).\n\nIn the present work, only the vertical flexible cylinder was studied. However, as\n\npresented in the Preface, p. xxi, experimental tests were also carried out for \u201ccatenary\u201d\n\nconfigurations at the IPT facility; see LIFE&amp;MO (2012c). Pereira (2014) has already\n\ncarried out an extensive experimental analsyis ov VIV of \u201ccatenary\u201d configurations,\n\nby using Galerkin\u2019s projections on proper numerically determined modes. Further\n\nmodal analysis with the \u201ccatenary\u201d model in order to assess hydrodynamics coefficients,\n\nnumerical calibration of modal phenomenological models, parametric resonance and\n\nMathieu instabilities, as well as the effects of modal decomposition using non-linear\n\nmodes.\n\n\n\n85\n\nReferences\n\nAbramowitz, M. and I.A.
