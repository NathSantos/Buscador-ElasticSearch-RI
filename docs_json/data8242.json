We re p o rt on a nine-year-old girl with clinical and radiological features of FOP. She was\nb o rn with bilateral hallux valgus and at the age of nine presented an indurate mass in the left cervical re-\ngion that was painful. A significant decreased range of motion in all levels of the spine and shoulder gir-\ndle was found. The radiographs showed heterotopic ossification in the thoracic region. The patient had\ntwo outbreaks of the disease (\u201cflare-ups\u201d) that were treated with prednisone 2 mg/kg/day for four days.\nAfter the \u201cflare-ups\u201d, she had a continuous therapy with a Cox-2 inhibitor (25 mg/day) and a leukotriene\ninhibitor, montelukast (10 mg/day). \n\nKEY WORDS: fibrodysplasia ossificans pro g ressiva, myositis ossificans pro g ressiva, myositis ossificans, hetero-\ntopic ossification.\n\nFibrodisplasia ossificante progressiva: relato de caso\n\nRESUMO - A fibrodisplasia ossificante pro g ressiva (FOP) \u00e9 doen\u00e7a rara, autoss\u00f4mica dominante, caracteri-\nzada por ossifica\u00e7\u00e3o heterot\u00f3pica pro g ressiva p\u00f3s-natal do tecido conjuntivo e malforma\u00e7\u00e3o cong\u00eanita\ndos h\u00e1luces. Relatamos o caso de menina de nove anos com o quadro cl\u00ednico-radiol\u00f3gico t\u00edpico de FOP,\nnascida com h\u00e1lux valgo bilateral e que aos 9 anos de idade apresentou massa dolorosa, de consist\u00eancia\ne n d u recida, sem sinais inflamat\u00f3rios, situada na regi\u00e3o cervical. Adicionalmente, era poss\u00edvel observar di-\nminui\u00e7\u00e3o importante da movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o em todos os n\u00edveis da coluna vertebral e da cintura escapular. A\navalia\u00e7\u00e3o radiol\u00f3gica revelou a presen\u00e7a de ossifica\u00e7\u00f5es heterot\u00f3picas na regi\u00e3o tor\u00e1cica e malform a \u00e7 \u00e3 o\nbilateral dos h\u00e1luces. A paciente teve outros dois surtos da doen\u00e7a, que foram tratados com cort i c o s t e r \u00f3 i d e\noral por quatro dias, (2 mg/kg/dia) seguido por tratamento prolongado com inibidores da Cox-2 (25 mg/dia)\ne com inibidor de leucotrienos (10 mg/dia). \n\nPA L AV R A S - C H AVE: fibrodisplasia ossificante pro g ressiva, miosite ossificante pro g ressiva, miosite ossifican-\nte, ossifica\u00e7\u00e3o heterot\u00f3pica.\n\nFibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a\nr a re autosomal dominant disorder in which cong e-\nnital abnormalities of the big toes are associated w i-\nth pro g ressive heterotopic ossification of the con-\nnective tissue stru c t u res including those related to\nthe striated muscles, leading to permanent disabi-\nl i t y. Studies from Europe and United States conclu-\nded that the estimate incidence of FOP is one in t w o\nmillion birt h s1. In Brazil there are some cases relat-\ned in literature like publish by Tonholo et al. in 1 9 9 42,\nNucci et al. in 20003, and Araujo et al. in 20054. C u r-\n\nre n t l y, the Brazilian FOP Association (FOP BRASIL)\nhas 49 registered cases of FOP.\n\nMost cases of FOP are due to new gene muta-\ntions, but genetic studies confirm the autosomal\ndominant nature and variable expression of the\np resumed defective gene. Genetic analysis re v e a l e d\nthat the FOP phenotype is linked to markers locat-\ned in chromosome 45. It is believed that a gene m u-\ntation causes an overe x p ression of a bone morpho-\ngenetic protein (BMP4)6.\n\n\n\nArq Neuropsiquiatr 2005;63(4) 1091\n\nCASE\nA nine-year-old girl presented the initial symptoms\n\nof FOP with tender and painful masses on the anterior\nabdominal wall accompanied by warm overlying skin\nand erythema. These masses pro g ressively appeared on\nthe thoracic and dorsal regions with the same clinical\nf e a t u res. At that time she was admitted to hospital for\ntwo weeks. Her blood and urinary tests were norm a l\nand no abnormal sign was seen on the magnetic reso-\nnance imaging of the abdomen. No history of local trau-\nma was re p o rted. Later the patient had two \u201cflare - u p s \u201d\n\nof the disease in the right and left cervical regions that\ndisappeared after two weeks. Physical examination sho-\nwed a hard mass on the left side of the cervical re g i o n .\nThe mass was tender and painful, but no warmth or in-\nflammation was noted (Fig 1A). Palpation revealed stiff-\nness of all abdominal and paraspinal muscles. Abduction\nof the shoulders was restricted to a 45\u00ba (Fig 1B). The pa-\ntient had bilateral hallux valgus but no other abnorm a l i-\nty of any other toes (Fig 2). Her parents didn\u2019t show any\nsimilar abnormalities on the physical examination. No h e-\nt e ropic ossification was observed in two radiographic\n\nFig 3.

Axial tru n k\ncomputerized tomography (CT) showed points of ossi-\nfication (Fig 3A). The three-dimensional (3D) surf a c e\nshaded display of the trunk CT showed multiple hetero-\ntopic ossifications in the spine and scapulas (Fig 3B). The\npatient took Vi o x x\u00ae for 6 months without any side e ff e c t s\nand now is taking Montelukast (10 mg/daily) and cort i-\ncosteroids (2 mg/Kg/4 days) for \u201cflare-ups\u201d. \n\nThis case re p o rt was approved by the hospital ethic\ncommission and the parents gave informed consent for\npublication.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGuy Patin first described FOP in 1692 in a young\npatient who \u201cturned to wood\u201d7. The autosomal d o-\nminant inheritance of FOP was first described by\nSympson in a case re p o rt of a 7-year-old boy with\nclassic features of FOP whose father had the same\ncongenital deformity of the great toes but no oth-\ner characteristics of this disorder8.\n\nGenetic linkage analysis has shown that the FOP\nphenotype is heterogeneous linked to markers\nlocated in the long arm of chromosome 4. In 2000,\nFeldman et al. described four affected families with\nmarkers located in the 4q27-315. Lucotte et al. pub-\nlished in 2000 that the FOP gene was related to\nc h romosome 17q21-229. Further studies, published\nby XU et al. and Kaplan et al. showed that there is\nno link between FOP and this gene1 0 , 1 1.\n\nA b n o rmalities of the great toes are observ e d\nat birth in most cases of FOP (bilateral hallux val-\ngus - microdactylia with hypoplasia or synostosis\nof the phalanges or both). In our case, the pare n t s\nreported that the patient had hallux valgus since\nb i rt h1 2. The initial symptoms of FOP are painful a n d\nh a rd soft tissue swellings over the affected m u s c l e s\nthat lead to ossification. It usually occurs from birt h\nup to the age of 16 years (mean age 4.6 years), fol-\nlowing spontaneous or trauma-induced \u201cflare -\nu p s \u201d1 , 1 3. Heterotopic ossification usually begins in\nthe cervical paraspinal muscles and later s p re a d s\nf rom axial to appendicular, cranial to caudal and\np roximal to distal sites. Scoliosis is a common find-\ning and is often the result of asymmetric hetero t o-\npic bones connecting the trunk and pelvis1.\n\nConductive hearing impairment is a common\nf e a t u re associated with this condition1 4 and it pro b-\nably occurs due to the fusion of the ossicles of the\ne a r1 5. Pro g ressive episodes of heterotopic ossifica-\ntion lead to ankylosis of all major joints of the axi-\nal and appendicular skeleton, rendering move-\nment impossible. Generally, in the second decade\n\nof life, FOP patients are confined to bed or wheel-\nc h a i r s1 6. Card i o p u l m o n a ry problems may occur and\na re associated with severe restrictive disease of\nthe chest wall17.\n\nFOP diagnosis is clinical and it is usually made\nbased on the presence of three major criteria1 5: C o n-\ngenital malformation of the great toes, pro g re s-\nsive heterotopic endochondral ossification (hetero-\ntopic bones that gradually form from cart i l a g e )\nand pro g ression of the disease in well-defined ana-\ntomical and temporal patterns. Laboratory tests m a y\nshow a discrete increase of ESR during the \u201cflare -\nups\u201d. Imaging exams like radiographs and tomo-\ngraphies shows the heterotopic bones and are use-\nful to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nD i ff e rential diagnosis includes other genetic ill-\nnesses that also cause the development of hetero-\ntopic ossifications, such as pro g ressive osseous het-\ne roplasia (POH), Albright here d i t a ry osteodystro-\nphy (AHO), osteoma cutis, ankylosing spondylitis,\nS t i l l \u2019s disease and Klippel-Feil-syndro m e1 5. The \u201c f l a re -\nups\u201d of FOP must be diff e rentiated from the inf l a m-\nm a t o ry processes of osseous tumors, and aggre s-\nsive juvenile fibromatosis.\n\nTreatment of FOP is multifactorial and is based\non injury prevention and clinical therapy. Pre v e n-\ntion of soft tissue injury and muscle damage, as\nwell as the prevention of falls, is extremely impor-\ntant. Intramuscular injections, including vaccines,\nmust be avoided. More o v e r, in routine dental care ,\no v e r s t retching of the jaw and intramuscular local\nanesthetic injections should also be avoided.\n\nPatients with FOP may have an additional risk\nof \u201cflare-ups\u201d after influenza-like illness. Thus, a\nsubcutaneous influenza vaccine could help these\npatients, particularly those who have severe re s t r i c-\ntive disease of the chest wall and are at a gre a t e r\nhigh risk of presenting complications of re s p i r a t o-\nry infections that are a frequent cause of death. \n\nD rug treatment of our patient was based initia-\nlly on the guidelines published by Kaplan et al.1 8\n\nand currently on the new guidelines published by\nthe same authors1 9. The patient received cort i c o s t e-\nroids in the acute phases of the disease and a long-\nt e rmtreatment using a combination of a leukotrie-\nne inhibitor and a Cox-2 inhibitor.\n\nC o rt i c o s t e roids given within the first 24 hours of\nf l a re-up may reduce the intense lymphocytic in-\nfiltration and tissue edema1 8. Prednisone is given for\nfour days, 2 mg/kg/day, and should be restricted to\nthe early symptomatic \u201cflare-ups\u201d that affect major\n\n\n\nArq Neuropsiquiatr 2005;63(4) 1093\n\nj o i n t s1 8. When prednisone is discontinued, a non-\ns t e roidal anti-inflammatory drug or a Cox-2 inhibitor\nmay be used symptomatically for the duration of\nthe \u201cflare-up\u201d. None of these drugs avoided the pro-\ng ression of the disease in our patient. Non-stero i d a l\na n t i - i n f l a m m a t o rydrugs like ibuprofen and indo-\nmethacin can be used the doses of 4-10 mg/kg (every\n6 hours) and 2-4 mg/kg/day, re s p e c t i v e l y.\n\nThe Cox-2 inhibitors restrain the activity of in-\nf l a m m a t o ryprostaglandins, which are potent co-\nstimulatory molecules along with BMPs in the in-\nduction of the heterotopic bone. Recently, after\nthe Vi o x x\u00ae recall, the use of Cox-2 inhibitors in the\npediatric population change to Celebrex\u00ae (altho-\nugh it has been used compassionately in childre n ,\nit is not approved for pediatric use). The dose ran-\nge is from 100 to 200 mg per day and can not exce-\ned a maximum total daily dose of 600 mg for more\nthan 16 months or maximum anti-angiogenic dose\nof 6 mg/kg or 250 mg/m2.\n\nLeukotriene inhibitors may reduce the down-\ns t ream effects of released mast cell mediators that\na re involved in the pathological process of hetero-\ntopic bone form a t i o n1 8. Montelukast, a leukotriene\ninhibitor may be prescribed in a dose of 5 or 10\nmg/day.\n\nF i b rodysplasia ossificans pro g ressiva is a rare\nand disabling disease that still does not have an\ne ffective treatment that can cure it or stop its pro-\ng ression. Physicians, health care pro f e s s i o n a l s ,\npatients and their families must be educated about\nthe disease. Although drugs can be used to de-\nc rease some symptoms, the best approach is still\nthe early diagnosis and prevention of trauma that\ncan provide a better quality of life. \n\nREFERENCES\n1.
