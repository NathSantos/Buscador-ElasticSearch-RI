A \n\nintrodu\u00e7\u00e3o de emendas org\u00e2nicas que podem fornecer nitrog\u00eanio dispon\u00edvel e a potencial \n\nadicion de microorganismos  pode contribuir para melhorar o processo de biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o. No \n\nentanto, pouco trabalho considerou quais emendas org\u00e2nicas s\u00e3o melhores em termos de sua \n\nabund\u00e2ncia relativa de degradadores para poluentes espec\u00edficos. Neste trabalho, os compostos \n\nde res\u00edduos verdes (GW) de diferentes estabilidades foram avaliados pelo potencial de \n\nbiorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o. Doze amostras de compostagem foram caracterizadas por par\u00e2metros \n\nincluindo estabilidade (usando uma configura\u00e7\u00e3o modificada validada neste projeto), \n\ncontagens de placas de Pseudomonas e Actinomicetos cultiv\u00e1veis e abund\u00e2ncia degradativa \n\nde gene (alkB, PAH-RHD GP e PAH-RHD GN). Estes s\u00e3o importantes para a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nalcanos e PAH, respectivamente. Comparando os compostos de residuos verdes acabado e \n\nn\u00e3o acabado do mesmo site, os resultados mostraram que a abund\u00e2ncia de alk B (codificando \n\nalcano monoxigenase) foi maior nas amostras de compostagem menos est\u00e1veis, o que \n\ncorresponde \u00e0 maior contagem de Pseudomonas. Resultados semelhantes foram obtidos para \n\no PAH-RHD GN (que codifica a Dioxigenase Hidroxilante de hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos \n\npoliarom\u00e1ticos em bact\u00e9rias Gram negativas), as amostras  menos est\u00e1veis apresentaram \n\nmaior abund\u00e2ncia de genes degradantes. Para PAH-RHD GP (codificando a Dioxigenase \n\nHidroxilante de hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos poliarom\u00e1ticos em bact\u00e9rias Gram positivas), \n\nn\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel ver uma diferen\u00e7a clara entre amostras acabadas e n\u00e3o acabadas. Dado que \n\nos composts menos est\u00e1veis tendem a ter maior Nitrogenio dispon\u00edvel, isso apoiaria o uso \n\ndesses compostos para a biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos de \n\npetr\u00f3leo alif\u00e1ticos e com hidrocarbonetos poli arom\u00e1ticos. \n\n \n\nKeywords: biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o, composto, alk B, PAH RHD GN, PAH RHD GP, alcanos, \n\nHAPs, qPCR \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nV \n\n    \n\n \n\nAssessment of compost for bioremediation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and \n\npetroleum hydrocarbon soils \n\nDiana Guillen Ferrari a, Isabel Cavaco a and Thomas J. Aspray b \n\n(a)Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, Portugal \n\n(b)Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK EH14 4AS \n\n \n\nBioremediation of petroleum and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated soils can be \n\na cost effective and efficient treatment approach. The introduction of organic amendments \n\nwhich can provide available nitrogen, and potentially additional microorganisms, can \n\ncontribute to improve the biodegradation process. However, little work has considered which \n\norganic amendments are best in terms of their relative abundance of degraders for specific \n\npollutants. In this work, green waste (GW) composts of different stability were assessed for \n\ntheir bioremediation potential. Twelve compost samples were characterised for parameters \n\nincluding stability (using a modified set up validated in this project), culturable microbial \n\nPseudomonas and Actinomycetes plate counts and degradative gene (alkB, PAH-RHD GP \n\nand PAH-RHD GN) abundance. These are important for the degradation of alkanes and PAH \n\nrespectively. Comparing finished and un-finished green compost from the same site, results \n\nshowed that the abundance of alkB (encoding alkane monooxygenase) was highest in the less \n\nstable compost samples, which corresponds with the higher Pseudomonas counts. Similar \n\nresults were obtained for PAH-RHD GN (encoding Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon-Ring \n\nHydroxylating Dioxygenase in Gram negative bacteria), the less stable samples presented \n\nhigher abundance of degrading genes. For PAH-RHD GP (encoding Polycyclic Aromatic \n\nHydrocarbon-Ring Hydroxylating Dioxygenase in Gram positive bacteria) abundance, it was \n\nnot possible to see a clear difference between finished and un-finished samples.  Given that \n\nless stable composts tend to have higher available N this would support the use of these \n\ncomposts for bioremediation of aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon and Poly aromatic \n\nhydrocarbon contaminated soils.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Bioremediation, compost, alk B, PAH RHD GN, PAH RHD GP, PAHs, alkanes, \n\nqPCR \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVI \n\n    \n\n \n\nSubject Index \n\nDeclaration of Authorship.........................................................................................................

INTRODUCTION \n\nBioremediation can be defined as the use of bacteria or plants to degrade, remove or \n\nneutralise chemical compounds from soil or water (Collin, 2004). Two methods used for \n\nbioremediation of environmental pollutants using microbes are biostimulation and \n\nbioaugmentation. Biostimulation consists in the introduction of nutrients, such as nitrogen \n\nand/or phosphorus, to enhance the remedial activity of the microorganisms. On the other \n\nhand, bioaugmentation involves the introduction of organisms, that are known to degrade the \n\ncontaminant chosen, into the contaminated soil. (Collin, 2004; Wu et al., 2016).     \n\nPolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are organic compounds that contain two or more fused \n\nbenzene rings; they are toxic and persistent pollutants, some of them with carcinogenic or \n\nmutagenic potential (Gupta et al., 2015; White &amp; Claxton, 2004). Their occurrence is natural \n\nand also anthropogenic, being the increase in the concentration in the environment caused by \n\nthe latter. Petroleum is composed by a mixture of hydrocarbons; aliphatic (e.g. alkanes, \n\ncycloalkanes) , aromatic, PAHs, and asphaltenes; these compounds are easily degraded by \n\nmicroorganisms, particularly the alkanes and low molecular PAHs, being the higher \n\nmolecular PAHs and asphaltenes more recalcitrant to biodegradation.(Ward &amp; Singh, 2003). \n\nThe introduction of organic amendments (e.g. composts, manure, municipal waste) which can  \n\nadjust the organic matter content, providing available nitrogen, phosphorus and other \n\nnutrients to stimulate the growth of native bacteria, and  additional microbial consortium \n\ninstead of a single microorganism, can contribute to improve the biodegradation process \n\n(Namkoong et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2001)  Generally,  pollutant removal and its \n\ndegradation efficiency, is positively related to the population of degrading microorganisms \n\n(Ghosal et al., 2016) , which makes more interesting to explore the potential of compost to \n\nincrease the population of degraders.  \n\nBioremediation of petroleum and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) , contaminated soils can \n\nbe a cost effective and efficient treatment approach (Wu et al., 2013). The use of \n\nconventional technologies that include removal, modification or isolation (e.g. incineration, \n\nlandfill) are expensive and could transfer the contaminant from one site to another, or \n\nbetween phases (Haritash &amp; Kaushik, 2009; Ward &amp; Singh, 2003). \n\nBioremediation has been used successfully for the degradation of PAH contaminated soils \n\n(Antizar-Ladislao et al, 2006; Chen et al., 2015;  K\u00e4stner &amp; Mahro, 1996) and of alkanes \n\n(Diplock et al., 2009; Namkoong et al., 2002; Taccari et al., 2012). Although many sites are \n\n\n\n2 \n\n    \n\n \n\ncontaminated with both aliphatic and aromatic contaminants, few relatively articles deal with \n\ndegradation of PAH and alkanes (Shahi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017). \n\nCompost Maturity and Stability \n\nMaturity and stability in compost, have been used sometimes as synonyms, but are two \n\ndifferent parameters that should be determined separately (Wichuk &amp; Mccartney, 2010; Wu \n\n&amp; Martinez, 2000). BSI PAS 100:2011 defines mature compost as material with low rate of \n\nbiodegradation, absence of pathogens and no phytotoxicity and stable compost as material \n\nwith biodegradation rate lower than 16 mg CO2 gOM\n-1 d-1. For (Wichuk &amp; Mccartney, 2010) \n\na mature compost is ready for a particular use. Many authors have mentioned the use of \n\nmature compost for biodegradation (Gomez &amp; Sartaj, 2013; K\u00e4stner &amp; Miltner, 2016; Taccari \n\net al., 2012; G. Wu et al., 2013), but the use of phytotoxicity as a maturity indicator is not a \n\ngood choice for compost applicated to bioremediation, because this material is going to be \n\ndegraded even further, and the salts that contribute to phytotoxicity could be useful as \n\nnutrients in this process. \n\nBeing compost stability the meassurement of the oxigen comsumption, CO2 production or \n\nself-heating  from the decomposition of the organic matter by the microorganisms (Barrena-\n\nGomez, et al., 2006) and this decomposition is linked to the abundance of degradable organic \n\nmatter and microorganisms, stability seems to be the key measure for the assesment of the \n\npotencial of compost for bioremediation.  \n\nTo assess the bioremediation potential of green waste and green and food waste compost \n\nsamples the aims of this research were: \n\n \n\n1)  Improve the robustness of ORG0020 compost stability determination. \n\n2) Assess the relationship between compost stability with the abundance of PAH and alkane \n\ndegraders using qPCR. PCR methods allow specific and sensitive detection of degrading \n\ngenes in bacteria from different taxonomic group, including non-culturable microorganisms \n\n(Perez-de-Mora et al., 2010) and is less time consuming. \n\n3) Assess the relationship between culturable microbial Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes \n\ncount in compost and contaminates soil and the abundance of catabolic genes. \n\n4) Assess the potential increment of alkane and PAH degraders of adding compost samples to \n\nknown contaminated soil samples. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n    \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1 Compost sample characterisation \n\nGreen, and food and green waste (GW and FGW respectively) compost samples, finished and \n\npost-sanitised, were collected from seven UK composting sites. \n\nTable 2.1 Compost identification, type, source and status. \n\nSample     Site Process type Feedstock Status \n\nA 1 In-vessel FGW Finished \n\nB 2 Ex situ GW Finished \n\nC 3 In-vessel FGW Finished \n\nD 4 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised \n\nE 4 Ex situ GW Finished \n\nF 1 In-vessel FGW Post sanitised \n\nG 1 In-vessel FGW Finished \n\nH 5 Ex situ GW Finished \n\nI 5 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised \n\nJ 6 Ex situ GW Finished \n\nK 7 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised \n\nL 7 Ex situ GW Finished \n\nFGW: food and green waste, GW: green waste. \n\nThe following assays were carried out on the 12 samples. \n\nDry matter was carried out according to BS EN 13040:2007 with the following \n\nmodifications: weight of sample approximately 9 g, dried for 20 h, weighted, the tray was \n\nplaced in the oven for an additional h, weighted, the difference between the two weights was \n\nnot more than 0.1 g. \n\nDetermination of laboratory bulk density was carried out according to BS EN 13040:2007. \n\nOrganic matter content was carried out according to BS EN 13039:2011 with the following \n\nmodifications: the sample was dried for 20 h at 103 \u00b0C, then placed in the desiccator and \n\nallowed to cool to room temperature, weighted, then placed again in the oven for 1 h more, \n\nplaced back in desiccator and allowed to cool to room temperature, weighted, the difference \n\nbetween the two weights was not more than 0.01 g.   \n\n\n\n4 \n\n    \n\n \n\npH: It was carried out according to BS EN 13037:2011 (HI 8424 pH meter, Hanna \n\nInstruments, USA). Commercially available buffers pH 7 and 10 were used for calibration. \n\n(Hanna Instruments, UK).  \n\nElectrical conductivity:  according to BS EN 13038:2011 (HI 99301 EC/TDS meter, Hanna \n\nInstruments, USA).  Unfiltered water extracts were used. \n\n2.2 Microbial plate counts \n\nSample aliquots, 1 g fresh weight were suspended in 9 ml of 0.85% (w/v) NaCl and shaken \n\nfor one min. Dilutions were made in decimal steps and cultured in triplicate on \n\nActinomycetes Isolation Agar (Fluka-Sigma Aldrich, India) and Pseudomonas Isolation agar \n\n(Fluka- Sigma Aldrich, India) for 48 h at 25 \u00b0C. Colonies were counted manually with \n\ncolony-forming units based on single dilutions, less than 300 CFU per plate. \n\n2.3 Compost stability  \n\n2.3.1 Compost stability was assessed using two set ups. \n\nEleven experiments were run, three (no. 9, 10 and 11) of which were done at low flow rate \n\n(?25 ml min-1) and nine (no. 1,2,3,4,5,7,12 and 13) at high air flow rate (45-50 ml min -1). \n\nOriginal set up (figure 2.1.A): It was done according to ORG0020  standard laboratory based \n\ntest to measure compost stability by measurement of evolved carbon dioxide (Llewelyn, \n\n2005). (Hailea V10 diaphragm pump, Guangdong Hailea Group Co., Ltd., China). \n\nStandardisation procedure of 1M solutions of HCl and NaOH can be found in appendix.   \n\nModified set up (figure 2.1.B): Instead of the diaphragm pump a multichannel peristaltic \n\npump head (205CA12, Watson Marlow Limited, UK.) connected to either a 502S or 520 Du \n\npump (Watson Marlow Limited, UK) was used. Marprene manifold tubing 2.79 mm bore and \n\n0.8 mm wall thickness, (part no 905.0027.008; Watson-Marlow Limited, UK) was used. \n\nMonitoring and adjustment (as necessary) of flow rate were done daily before and after \n\nchanging the NaOH traps in both setups. Monitoring was carried out at the exit pipe of the \n\nCO2 traps using an Ellutia 7000 flow meter. The flow rate and time taken for monitoring and \n\nadjustment were recorded. \n\n2.3.2 Compost stability modifying the flow \n\nA short experiment (no. 3) only until day four using the original set up but modifying the \n\nflow on day two was run. The flow was adjusted to&lt;10 ml/min in three vessels, the other \n\nfour (three replicates and one blank) were maintained within method range. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Compost stability set ups \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 Contaminated soil characterisation \n\nSoil samples (31 in total) were provided by industrial contacts and collaborators from three \n\ncontaminated sites from the U.K. and Switzerland. \n\npH: 1g fresh weight of contaminated soil sample vas suspended in 5 ml of distilled water, \n\nshaken for 30 s then let settled for 30 min and shaken again for 30 s before pH was measured \n\n(HI 8242 pH meter, Hanna Instruments, USA). Commercially available buffers pH 7 and 10 \n\nwere used for calibration (Hanna Instruments, UK). \n\n2.5 Soil microbial plate counts \n\nThe method used for compost samples was used. \n\nB \n\nA \n\n\n\n6 \n\n    \n\n \n\n2.6 DNA extraction and quantification \n\nStandards: DNA was extracted from bacterial culture of Pseudomonas putida (NCIMB 9816, \n\nculture collection) and Rhodococcus sp. (NCIMB 12038, culture collection) in nutrient agar \n\ngrown for 48 h at 30 \u00b0C, using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). \n\nCompost: Genomic DNA was extracted from compost samples in duplicate (0.25 g fresh \n\ncompost each) and then pooled, using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, \n\nInc., USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 \n\n(Thermo Scientific). \n\nContaminated soil: Genomic DNA was extracted from soil samples (0.25 g fresh soil each) \n\nusing PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., USA) according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). \n\n2.7 Detection of alk B, PAH-RHD GN AND PAH-RHD GP genes \n\nTo obtain the standards for Real time PCR, End point PCR was carried out with Veriti, 96 \n\nwell thermal cycler (AB Applied Biosystems).

IMPROVEMENT OF ORG0020 SETUP FOR COMPOST STABILITY \n\nDETERMINATION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1 Compost characterisation \n\nFive finished and unfinished compost samples from four composting sites were used for the \n\nstability experiments. The dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) content were measured, \n\nas they are necessary for the calculation of compost stability, results are shown in table 3.1. \n\nThe compost samples stability ranged from 0.48 to 7.93 mg CO2 g OM\n-1d-1 and therefore fall \n\nwithin the  PAS 100:2011 (BSI, 2011) limit of 16 mg CO2 g OM\n-1d-1.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Characterisation of samples used for compost stability experiments  \n\nSample Feedstock Size   \n\n(mm) \n\nDM        \n\n          (%) \n\nOM     \n\n   (%) \n\nStability                     \n\n(mgCO2 gOM--1 d-1) \n\nA FGW 0-20 54.63 36.04 0.48 \n\nB GW 0-10 43.89 43.59 2.49 \n\nC FGW 0-20 58.58 64.34  3.95* \n\nD GW 0-20 34.93 43.67 7.93 \n\nE GW 0-20 42.85 33.74 2.39 \n\n*with low flow (25 ml/min), the rest of the samples were measured at high flow = 45-50 ml min-1. GW: green waste, FGW: \n\nfood and green waste. The results presented of DM, OM and Stability are the average among three replicates. \n\n \n\n3.2 Equilibration experiments \n\n3.2.1 Equilibration experiments with both set ups \n\nTo study the impact of the flow behaviour during the equilibration period, experiments were \n\nrun until day 4, the air flow was measure twice a day for the four days. As shown in figure \n\n3.1. the air flow of the original set up (dotted line) was variable, the vessels that don\u2019t appear \n\nin the graph fell out of range:  airflow lower than the method\u2019s minimum (25 ml min-1) in \n\nexperiments 1 and 2, and higher than the maximum (75 ml min-1) in experiment 2. The \n\nmodified set up air flow rate (solid lines) was within method range throughout this period. \n\nThe hollow squares represent the blanks of each set up. \n\nThe results of the CO2 evolution after the equilibration period are shown in table 3.2., they \n\ncorrespond to the average of three replicates. In experiment 1 the standard deviation is \n\nsignificantly higher in the original set up than in the modified, this could be due to the \n\n\n\n10 \n\n    \n\n \n\nvariation of the airflow during the equilibration period, falling out or range in the four vessels \n\nof the original set up. Less precision is also observed in the original set up of experiment 2 \n\n(table 3.2.), probably influenced by lower and higher flowrate in some vessels (figure 3.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Air flow in equilibration experiments with both set ups \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Equilibration experiments: modifying the flow, only original set up \n\nAfter observing this rise in the standard deviation of the CO2 evolved on experiments 1 and 2 \n\n(table 3.2.), when during the equilibration period the air flow rate was lower than method\u2019s \n\nrange; an experiment using the original set up but modifying the flow on day 2 was run, \n\nfigure 3.2. The flow was adjusted to&lt;10 ml/min in 3 vessels, the other 4 (3 replicates and 1 \n\nblank) were maintained within method range. \n\nThe stability results are shown in table 3.2. Higher CO2 evolution, about 20%, was observed \n\nfor the vessels with the modified flow than with the original set up. Therefore, it seems to be \n\na relation between airflow within method range and accuracy of CO2 evolution measurement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\n35\n\n45\n\n55\n\n65\n\n75\n\nA\nir\n\n f\nlo\n\nw\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\nm\n\nl \nm\n\nin\n-1\n\n) E X P E R I M E N T  1\n\n25\n\n35\n\n45\n\n55\n\n65\n\n75\n\n0 1 A 1 B 2 A 2 B 3 A 3 B 4\n\nA\nir\n\n f\nlo\n\nw\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\nm\n\nl \nm\n\nin\n-1\n\n)\n\nDays\n\nE X P E R I M E N T  2\n\n  0.4 \n\n \n  0.5 \n\n \n\n 13 0.3 \n0.4 \n\n \n\n 6 \n\n \n\n 23 \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n  4 \n\n \n\n   17 \n\n \n\n19 \n\n1 \n\n23 \n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n1 \n\n \n\n0.7 \n\n \n\n  2 \n\n \n\n  149 \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Air flow in experiment modifying the flow \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 CO2 evolution after equilibration period with standard deviations in parentheses \n\nExperiment number 1 2 3 \n\nCompost sample B B D \n\nDay four (mgCO2 gOM-1) \n\nOriginal 8.31 (4.73) 1.97 (0.54) 8.99 (0.44) \n\nOriginal* n/a n/a 10.90 (0.24) \n\nModified 2.74 (0.22) 2.16 (0.30) n/a \n\nhigh flow = 45-50 ml min-1 per vessel. n/a: not applicable.

In these experiments, the flow \n\nduring equilibration was not measured, following the standard protocol. Experiments 4, 6, \n\nand 7 were run in triplicate plus one blank in both set ups. Experiments 12 and 13 were run \n\nwith five replicates (one outlier on both set ups was eliminated) and one blank. \n\nIn all the experiments shown, there was variation of the airflow rate during the equilibration \n\nperiod in the original set up.

(Llewelyn, 2005) reported an in-house precision of 0.906 mg CO2 gOM\n-1 d-1, this \n\nvalue was assessed using a water bath at 25\u00b0C with 8 replicates, since the method\u2019s bath \n\ntemperature is 30\u00b0C and samples are run in 3 replicates, the value of precision doesn\u2019t seem \n\nappropriate to assess the performance of the OG0020 test.  \n\nSample homogeneity and the measurements of dry matter and volatile solids are important \n\nfactors influencing the precision of this method (Llewelyn, 2012). However, in the \n\nexperiments of this work, the value of dry matter and volatile solids used were applied \n\nconsistently to both set ups, therefore, the factors influencing the precision would be sample \n\nhomogeneity and air flow rate within range. When the flow was lower than the required by \n\n\n\n14 \n\n    \n\n \n\nthe method there could have been a CO2 accumulation in the vessels during the equilibration \n\nperiod, and once the airflow was restored to the value needed this CO2 was collected in the \n\nNaOH traps which could affect the accuracy of the measurement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n    \n\n \n\n4. ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL OF COMPOST \n\nBASED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPOST STABILITY AND \n\nCATABOLIC GENE ABUNDANCE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n4.1 Compost characterisation \n\nCharacterisation results of ten finished and post sanitised compost samples from six \n\ncomposting sites are shown in table 4.1.  The pH range is between 7.11 and 8.65 for samples \n\nfalling within the PAS 100:2011 stability limit of 16 mg CO2 gOM\n-1 d-1. By comparing the  \n\nmore active samples F and G, one unfinished and one finished, the pH is 6.59 and 6.19 \n\nrespectively, which could be explained by the abundance of organic acids during the first \n\nstages of decomposition, lowering the pH, as degradation proceeds organic acids are \n\nneutralized and ammonia mineralized (Beck-Friis et al., 2003) and mature compost can have \n\npH between 7 and 9.  Food compost samples tend to have higher concentration of nitrate \n\nwhich can lead to lower pH and higher EC ( sample G) (Sanchez-Monedero, et al. , 2001).

EC: electrical conductivity, DM: dry \n\nmatter content, OM: organic matter content. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n    \n\n \n\ndegraders, and samples F and G, from the same site, have approximately the same stability \n\nvalue, although one of them is finished and the other un finished, they are discarded from the \n\nstudy. \n\n4.2 Quantification of degrading genes:  alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP \n\nReal time PCR was run to quantify the abundance of the alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes. \n\nAlk B gene is an indicator of the presence of alk B degraders (Kloos et al., 2006) \n\n(Guermouche M\u2019rassi et al., 2015) and  PAH RHD genes of PAH degraders (C\u00e9bron et al., \n\n2008) respectively. \n\n4.2.1 Melt curve analysis and amplification efficiency \n\nMelt curve analysis is an important quality control aspect for SYBR green based qPCR. The \n\nanalysis of the alk B curves showed only one peak present in all the samples. The melting \n\ntemperature of the product of the standards, made with pure cultures, is slightly lower than of \n\nthe product of the environmental samples. In absence of samples, it seems there is some \n\nprimer dimer amplification (negatives). The standard curve was linear, data shown in table \n\n4.2. and the efficiency close to other study (where reported) using the same primers and \n\nmethod (Schulz et al., 2012; Wallisch et al., 2014). These primers were used for \n\ncontaminated soil amended with compost (Wallisch et al., 2014) and in soil and maize and \n\npea plant litter (Schulz et al., 2012), they have performed well in compost samples. \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 Real time PCR standard curves data and efficiency \n\nGene Slope R2 Efficiency                     \n\n(%) \n\nAlk B \n\nPAH RHD GP \n\n? - 3.695 ?0.966 ?78.37 \n\n? - 4.385 ?0.941 ?60.07 \n\nPAH RHD GN ? - 4.57 ?0.929 ?52.46 \n\n \n\nIn the PAH RHD GN melt curve analysis samples D, the one with higher abundance (table \n\n4.3), K and L showed a single peak (data not shown). Samples A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I and J \n\npresented multiples peaks, one of them in the melting temperature of the product desired and \n\nthe rest around 74 \u00b0C. Multiple peaks were also observe for the standard at low concentration \n\n103 and in absence of samples (negatives). Although the standard curve was linear (table \n\n4.2.), the efficiency was low (?52.46).  The curve for PAH RHD GP showed one peak for \n\nsamples A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, K and L in the same temperature of the products of the \n\n\n\n17 \n\n    \n\n \n\nstandards, and multiple peaks for sample F (lowest abundance) and for the negatives (absence \n\nof sample). The standard curve was linear with low amplification efficiency, but better than \n\nfor PAH RHD GN. (C\u00e9bron et al., 2008) reported variation in DNA amplification efficiency \n\ndue to presence of PCR inhibitor substances (e.g. humic acids) in soil and sediments samples, \n\nthis could explain the low efficiency showed in this study for compost samples. Because the \n\namplification efficiency is low, the values of the concentration of PAH RHD GN and GP \n\ncould be higher if they were corrected measuring the value of inhibition. \n\n4.2.2 Catabolic genes\u2019 abundance \n\nThe abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes can be found on table 4.3 (the data \n\nrepresents the mean between two replicates).  The alk B gene presence range was from 1.23 x \n\n105 to 1.53 x 108 copies g-1 compost dw. The PAH RHD GN presence range from 1.59 x 105 \n\nto 6.75 x 106 copies g-1 compost dw. The PAH RHD GP presence range from 1.96 x 105 to \n\n3.39 x 107 copies g-1 compost dw. Standard deviation between replicates was done as part of \n\nthe qPCR program (CT st deviation &lt;0.50), for alk B all samples were within range; for PAH \n\nRHD GN there was high standard deviation between replicates in samples B, I, J and L, and \n\nfor PAH RHD GP in sample G. In all samples, the difference between replicates was lower \n\nthan one order of magnitude. This could be due to Ct values higher than 30, or error in \n\npipetting. \n\n4.3. Relationship between compost stability and degrading gene abundance \n\nPlots of catabolic gene abundance vs compost stability were made to explore if there is a \n\ncorrelation. As we can observe in figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, apparently there is no linear \n\ncorrelation between these variables. Further analysis considered whether there was a \n\ncorrelation for specific feedstocks (GW and FGW) derived compost. Samples A, C and J \n\n(FGW) have no apparent correlation in any of the degrading genes. Samples B, D, E, H, I, K \n\nand L (GW) didn\u2019t show any linear correlation either (data not shown). Because compost \n\ncomposition changes depending on when the process started (availability of feedstocks, \n\ntemperature), to study if there is a correlation it was necessary to reduce variables, the \n\napproach taken for this was comparing gene abundance and compost stability between \n\nfinished and un-finished samples from the same site. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Alk B abundance vs compost stability \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 PAH RHD GP abundance vs compost stability \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 PAH RHD GN abundance vs compost stability \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nH\nIJ\n\nKJ\n\nR\u00b2 = 0,0018\n\n0,00E+00\n\n2,00E+07\n\n4,00E+07\n\n6,00E+07\n\n8,00E+07\n\n1,00E+08\n\n1,20E+08\n\n1,40E+08\n\n1,60E+08\n\n1,80E+08\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\na\nlk\n\n B\n  \n\n(c\no\n\np\nie\n\ns \ng\n\n-1\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\no\n\nrs\n d\n\nw\n)\n\nStability (mg CO2 gOM\n-1 d-1)\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n\nDE\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\nK\n\nL R\u00b2 = 0,07\n\n0,00E+00\n\n5,00E+06\n\n1,00E+07\n\n1,50E+07\n\n2,00E+07\n\n2,50E+07\n\n3,00E+07\n\n3,50E+07\n\n4,00E+07\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16P\nA\n\nH\n R\n\nH\nD\n\n G\nP\n\n (\nco\n\np\nie\n\ns \ng\n\n-1\nco\n\nm\np\n\no\nst\n\n d\nw\n\n)\n\nCompost stability (mg CO2 gOM \n-1 d-1)\n\nA\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nH\n\nIJ\n\nK\nL\n\nR\u00b2 = 0,0555\n\n0,00E+00\n\n5,00E+05\n\n1,00E+06\n\n1,50E+06\n\n2,00E+06\n\n2,50E+06\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\nP\nA\n\nH\n R\n\nH\nD\n\n G\nN\n\n  \n(c\n\no\np\n\nie\ns \n\ng\n-1\n\n c\no\n\nm\np\n\no\nst\n\n d\nw\n\n)\n\nStability (mg CO2 gOM\n-1 d-1)\n\n\n\n19 \n\n    \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 Compost stability and alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP gene abundance \n\nGW: green waste, FGW: food and green waste. \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Relationship between compost stability and alk B abundance \n\nComparing GW finished and un-finished samples from sites 4 and 5 (figure 4.4), the \n\nunfinished and more active (D, I) have higher quantity of alk B genes (one order of \n\nmagnitude) than the finished and less active (E, H). A similar result has been shown by \n\n(Wallisch et al., 2014)  who found significantly higher gene numbers (one order of \n\nmagnitude) in contaminated soil treated with immature compost compared to that with \n\nmature compost. (Franke-Whittle et al, 2009) have also found that in GW compost, the \n\nnumbers of known compost microorganisms were higher for 2-week compost than 16-week \n\nsamples, however, they didn\u2019t characterise them as alk B degraders. There is also the \n\npossibility of presence of alkane degraders that don\u2019t present the alk B gene, these \n\nmicroorganisms wouldn\u2019t be detected by this method. For site 7, samples K and L the \n\nabundance of alk B is higher in sample L, the less active, finished compost. The alk B \n\nabundance in the samples from this site are two and one orders of magnitude lower than in \n\nthe sites 4 and 5 respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSite Feedstocks Sample Status Stability \n\n(mgCO2 g \n\nOM-1 d-1) \n\n      alk B            PAH RHD GP     PAH RHD GN \n\n                       (copies g-1 compost dw) \n\n \n\n4 GW D Un finished 7.93 1.53 x 108 3.34 x 107 2.34 x 106 \n\n GW E Finished 2.39 3.86 x 107 3.39 x 107 1.75 x 106 \n\n5 GW I Un finished 6.50 1.16 x 107 1.14 x 107 6.75 x 106 \n\n GW H Finished 3.25 3.12 x 106 5.10 x 106 3.75 x 106 \n\n7 GW K Un finished 14.69 1.22 x 106 1.04 x 106 4.32 x 105 \n\n GW L Finished 2.11 5.19 x 106 4.20 x 106 3.57 x 105 \n\n1 FGW A Finished 0.48 6.83 x 107 2.28 x 107 1.89 x 106 \n\n2 GW B Finished 2.49 4.26 x 107 2.43 x 107 1.79 x 106 \n\n3 FGW C Finished 3.95 1.33 x 108 9.20 x 106 1.28 x 106 \n\n6 GW J Finished 3.62 7.50 x 106 3.02 x 106 6.21 x 105 \n\n\n\n20 \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4.

Finished and un-finished compost PAH RHD GN abundance vs compost stability \n\n \n\n4.4 Assessment of bioremediation potential \n\nThe results showed that there is apparent relationship between compost stability and Alk B \n\nand PAH RHD GN abundance, in more active samples the number of degrading genes is \n\nhigher, which would support the use of less stable (immature) composts for bioremediation of \n\nPAH and petroleum hydrocarbon soils. Nevertheless, future work should prove if this \n\ncorrespond to abundance of expressed genes and therefore, the potential of augmenting the \n\ndegraders population on soil, and as a result if the biodegradation rate is enhanced. \n\n4.5 Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes microbial plate count \n\nSince most of the alk B and PAH known degraders correspond to the genera Pseudomonas \n\nand Actinomycetes, cultural microbial plate were counted, data in table 4.4. \n\nComparing the microbial count between samples D and E, from site 4, the actinomycetes \n\ncount is higher in samples D (un-finished). In sites 5 and 7,  the CFUs is higher in the \n\nsamples H and K (less active, finished) than in I and L (more active, immature), this finding \n\nagrees with (Franke-Whittle et al., 2009), who found higher number of actinomycetes in \n\nmature compost  (16-week) than in fresher samples (2-week) and it\u2019s consistent with (Antil \n\n&amp; Raj, 2012) who includes the increase of actinomycetes count at the end of the composting \n\nprocess, as one of the indicators of compost maturity. \n\nThe pseudomonas count in sites 4 and 7 is one order of magnitude higher in the more active \n\nsamples D and L than in the finished samples E and K. For samples I and H of site 5, the \n\npseudomonas count is almost one order of magnitude higher in the finished sample (H), but \n\nthe standard deviation (89.80) of the measurement in this sample, is too high to be reliable. \n\nThis results are comparable to (MacCready et al., 2013) who have found higher numbers of \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n0,00E+00\n\n5,00E+05\n\n1,00E+06\n\n1,50E+06\n\n2,00E+06\n\n2,50E+06\n\nD E I H K L\n\nsite 4 site 5 site 7\n\nS\nta\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n C\n\nO\n2\n\n g\nO\n\nM\n-1\n\nd\n-1\n\n)\n\nP\nA\n\nH\n R\n\nH\nD\n\n G\nN\n\n (\nco\n\np\nie\n\ns \ng\n\n-1\nd\n\nw\n)\n\nSamples\n\n\n\n22 \n\n    \n\n \n\npseudomonas in the mesophilic phase, their numbers decreased after the temperature rises \n\nhigher than 55\u00b0C, finding lower quantity in finished compost.

COMPARISON OF ALK B, PAH RHD GP AND PAH RHD GN GENE \n\nABUNDANCE IN PAH CONTAMINATED SOILS AND COMPOSTS. RESULTS \n\nAND DISCUSSION. \n\n5.1. Quantification of degrading genes:  alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP. \n\nIn order to compare gene abundance in contaminated soils to those in composts as an \n\napproach to bioremediation, quantification of the abundance of degrading genes alk B, PAH \n\nRHD GN and GP in contaminated soils sample was done using Real time PCR.  As was \n\nmentioned in chapter 4, Alk B gene is an indicator of the presence of alk B degraders (Kloos \n\net al., 2006) (Guermouche M\u2019rassi et al., 2015) and  PAH RHD genes of PAH degraders \n\n(C\u00e9bron et al., 2008) respectively.  \n\n5.1.1. Melt curve analysis \n\nTo check if the right product was amplified and the performance of the primers and the \n\nmethod, a melt curve analysis was made. \n\n5.1.1.1 Contaminated soil site 1 \n\nThe analysis of the Alk B melt curve showed only one peak in all the samples, at around the \n\nsame temperature of the products of the standards. The standard curve was linear, data shown \n\nin table 5.1, and the efficiency lower than others studies (Schulz et al., 2012; Wallisch et al., \n\n2014), this could be because environmental samples are sensitive to inhibition. \n\nIn the melt curve analysis of PAH RHD GN one peak appeared for samples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, \n\n9, 12, 14, 15 16, 17 and 18. Multiple peaks were present for samples: 10 (lowest abundance, \n\ntable 5.3), 11 and 13 and for low concentration standard 103. The standard curve was linear, \n\nand the efficiency was low, but higher than the one with the compost samples. PAH RHD GP \n\nmelt curve showed multiple peaks for all the samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, \n\n15, 16, 17 and 18. The standard curve was linear, and the efficiency was low, but higher than \n\nwith the compost samples. Low efficiencies with these primers and its possible causes were \n\ndiscussed in section 4.2.1. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 Contaminated soil site 1, amplification curve data and efficiency  \n\nGene Slope R2 Efficiency (%) \n\nAlk B \n\nPAH RHD GP \n\n-4.371 ?0.947 ?69.34 \n\n-4.712 ?0.959 ?63.015 \n\nPAH RHD GN  -4.975 ?0.941 ?58.51 \n\n\n\n26 \n\n    \n\n \n\n5.1.1.2 Contaminated soil sites 2 and 3 \n\nThe analysis of the melt curve for Alk B gene showed one peak  for samples: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. \n\nMultiples peaks were present samples 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The standard curve was \n\nlinear, data in table 5.2 and the efficiency was lower than in other studies (Wallisch et al., \n\n2014)  \n\nFor PAH RHD GN gene all the samples presented one peak. The standard curve was linear, \n\ndata in table 5.2 and the efficiency low, even lower than in chapter 4 with compost samples. \n\nAs mentioned before, this could be due the presence of inhibitors in the environmental \n\nsamples (C\u00e9bron et al., 2008). The analysis of the melt curve for PAH RHD GP showed \n\nsingle peaks for samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Multiple peaks were present for samples 9, \n\n10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The standard curve was linear, and the efficiency comparable as the \n\nones obtained with the compost samples. \n\nTable 5.2 Contaminated soils sites 2 and 3, amplification curves data and efficiency \n\nGene Slope R2 Efficiency (%) \n\nAlk B \n\nPAH RHD GP \n\n-4.282 ?0.908 ?71.21 \n\n-4.71 ?0.999 ?63.048 \n\nPAH RHD GN  -6.142 ?0.857 ?45.486 \n\n \n\n5.1.2.

The alk B gene presence range was from 2.92 x \n\n10 5 to 1.52 x 10 8 copies g-1dw., high standard deviation for samples 1,9, 10, 12, 16, and 18. \n\nThe PAH RHD GN presence range from 6.05 x 10 5 to 1.13 x 10 9 copies g-1 soil dw, high \n\nstandard deviation for samples 1, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 18. The PAH RHD GP presence range \n\nfrom 2.54 x 104 to 7.46 x 10 5 copies g-1 soil dw and showed high standard deviation for the \n\nsamples 8, 10, 12 and 13. Lower values of PAH RHD genes were obtained by (C\u00e9bron et al., \n\n2008) 4.4 x 104 (\u00b12.4 x 104) to 4.7 x 107 (\u00b12.4 x 107) copies g? 1 soil or sediment dw for \n\nhighly contaminated soils. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n    \n\n \n\n5.3 PAH concentration and degrading gene abundance in contaminated soil site 1 \n\n*data provided by industrial contacts and collaborators \n\n \n\n5.1.2.2 Contaminated soil sites 2 and 3The abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes \n\nfor sites 2 and 3 can be found on table 5.4 (the data represents the mean between two \n\nreplicates).

This value is a fine balance between providing optimal \n\nquantities of nutrients and microorganisms, and keeping the amount of extra contaminated \n\nmaterial to a minimum. \n\nComparing compost\u2019s D, E, I and H abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GP and GN genes and \n\nthe range of these genes abundance in site 1 (table 5.5) we can conclude that the amendment \n\nwith these composts would increase the degrading genes in this site. For samples K and L and \n\nsite 1 the augmentation would occur for genes alk B and PAH RHD GP, for PAH RHD GN \n\nthis would not be the case due since the abundance of this gene in these samples falls out of \n\nthe range of the abundance in site 1. \n\nIn site 2 none of the compost samples would increase the abundance of PAH RHD GN, the \n\nrange of these genes is higher in the soil than in the compost samples. For the alk B gene \n\nsamples D, E, I and L could increase the abundance. For the PAH RHD GP gene all of the \n\ncompost samples would increase the abundance of the gene. \n\nSample Site alk B \n\n \n\nPAH RHD GP             \n\n(copies g-1 soil fw) \n\nPAH RHD GN \n\n1 2 7.70 x 107 \n\n7.62 x 107 \n\n3.69 x 107 \n\n7.49 x 107 \n\n4.38 x 107 \n\n8.27 x 107 \n\n2.45 x 106 \n\n2.59 x 106 \n\n4.03 x 106 \n\n23.94 x 106 \n\n23.86 x 106 \n\n2.62 x 106 \n\n1.93 x 107 \n\n1.28 x 107 \n\n7.21 x 105 \n\n1.92 x 106 \n\n1.68 x 106 \n\n2.62 x 106 \n\n1.54 x 106 \n\n1.80 x 106 \n\n6.11 x 105 \n\n5.97 x 105 \n\n4.99 x 105 \n\n3.65 x 105 \n\n1.70 x 105 \n\n4.32 x 105 \n\n1.15 x 106 \n\n9.73 x 105 \n\n2.58 x 107 \n\n5.33 x 107 \n\n1.95 x 107 \n\n2.16 x 107 \n\n1.32 x 107 \n\n4.79 x 107 \n\n2.17 x 107 \n\n2.60 x 107 \n\n1.61 x 107 \n\n1.83 x 107 \n\n1.10 x 107 \n\n3.01 x 107 \n\n9.32 x 106 \n\n4.76 x 107 \n\n2  \n\n3  \n\n4  \n\n5  \n\n6  \n\n7  \n\n8  \n\n9  \n\n10  \n\n11 3 \n\n12  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n    \n\n \n\nIn site 3 samples D, E, I, H, and L would increase the quantity of alk B gene, for PAH RHD \n\nGP all of the compost samples would contribute to the augmentation of the degrading genes, \n\nthis is not the case for PAH RHD GN, where none of the samples could increase the \n\nabundance on the contrary samples K and L could decrease it. \n\nConsidering finished and un-finished compost for all the sites compost sample D (un-\n\nfinished) would increase more the abundance of the catabolic genes than sample E (finished). \n\nBetween samples I and H, sample I (un-finished) would increase the catabolic gene \n\nabundance.

As we can observe in figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 there \n\nappear to be no linear correlation. For alk B and PAH RHD GN it seems to be a maximum \n\nconcentration where the abundance of these genes is the highest and after this they start to \n\ndecrease and then remain at about 105  copies g-1 dw, this could be related to high \n\nconcentration of PAH which could inhibit its degradation (Providenti et al., 1993).

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \n\nIn this work twelve compost samples of different type and age were characterised in order to \n\nanalyse their bioremediation potential comparing compost stability and abundance of alk B, \n\nPAH RHD GN and PAH RHD GP genes. By comparing different types of compost, too \n\nmany variables were present which made impossible to find a clear trend, therefore the \n\npotential was only analysed in Green compost, comparing finished and un-finished samples \n\nfrom the same site. \n\n\u2022 A modified setup of the compost stability measurement ORG0020 was developed and \n\nfound to be more precise than the original setup. With new set up, also the accuracy \n\nhas been improved. \n\n\u2022 Three primers have been tried in compost samples, the alk B having good results and \n\nthe PAH RHD GN and GP with apparent inhibition, sample dilution or other methods \n\nto reduce the interference could be used to get more accurate results. \n\n\u2022 Given that the results showed higher alkB and PAH RHD GN degrading gene \n\nabundance in less stable GW composts, and that these composts tend to have higher \n\navailable N, this would support the use of these composts for bioremediation of \n\naliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated \n\nsoils. \n\n\u2022 For PAH RHD GP gene abundance and compost stability there was no clear \n\nrelationship, the abundance values were similar between finished and un-finished \n\nsamples. \n\n\u2022 While this study shows that the abundance of degrading genes (alk B and PAH RHD \n\nGN) is higher in less stable compost, future work should prove if this correspond to \n\nabundance of expressed genes and therefore, the potential of augmenting the \n\ndegraders population on soil, and as a result if the biodegradation rate is enhanced. \n\n\u2022 Post-sanitised compost shouldn\u2019t contain pathogen microorganisms, to assure the \n\nunfinished (more active) compost doesn\u2019t spread E. coli or Salmonella, a microbial \n\ncount and presence test should be made. \n\n\u2022 Another approach it would be to do next generation sequencing or DGGE to identify \n\nthe microorganisms to check if they have been proved to be alkane or PAH degraders \n\nor to reveal unknown or uncultured bacteria. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n    \n\n \n\n\u2022 Comparing the abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP in know contaminated \n\nsoils and compost, the potential of the increment of alkane and PAH degraders is \n\nhigher with un-finished composts. \n\n\u2022 Pseudomonas plate count was higher in the more active composts, similar to results \n\nfound in other studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n    \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAntil, R.
