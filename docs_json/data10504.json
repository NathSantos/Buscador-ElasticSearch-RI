In this\nstudy, we investigated the period of activity and the habitat use of two species of the genus Potamotrygon in the upper\nParan\u00e1 River basin, Southeastern Brazil. Potamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro are similar to each other as far as the\nanalyzed behavior is concerned. Individuals of both species segregate according to their size, and in function of the depth\nand period of the day. Younger individuals inhabit mostly sandy beaches and places that are no deeper than four meters\nthroughout the whole day. Bigger stingrays realize bathymetric migrations, alternating their position between places\ndeeper than eight meters during the day, and shallow areas at night. Individuals of intermediate size inhabit transition\nenvironments that have greater habitat diversity. Both species presented mostly nocturnal habits, especially regarding\ntheir feeding behavior. The behavioral patterns observed seem to go through ontogenetic variations and probably change\nthroughout the year, between dry and wet seasons.\n\nInforma\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o modo de vida das raias de \u00e1gua doce (Potamotrygonidae) sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais s\u00e3o escassas.

Knowledge of fishes\u2019 way of life in nature and\ntheir preference for particular types of environments have\nalso been used to identify and protect specific habitats and\nto support actions of management and conservation of\nspecies in different parts of the world (Steimle &amp; Zetlin, 2000;\nSimpfendorfer &amp; Heupel, 2004; Aguiar et al., 2009).\n\nIn Brazil, research into the behavior of fish in the natural\nenvironment is recent but has been steadily growing from\n\n\n\nActivity and habitat use of two species of stingrays82\n\nyear to year, normally focusing on species of teleostean\nfish (Sazima, 1986; Casatti &amp; Castro, 1998; Sabino, 1999;\nTeresa et al., 2011). Information of this kind is scarce when\ndealing with elasmobranchs, particularly with stingrays of\nthe family Potamotrygonidae (Castex, 1963; Achenbach &amp;\nAchenbach, 1976; Rosa, 1985). Only in recent years, the\nsurveys of Brazilian fish species, and particularly of\nfreshwater stingrays, were intensified. In the last years, the\npotamotrygonids have rekindled the interest of researchers,\nenabling the generation of data on the biology, ecology,\ntaxonomy, and toxicology of some species (see Garrone Neto\n&amp; Haddad Jr., 2010; Rosa et al., 2010; Carvalho &amp; Lovejoy,\n2011 and references therein).\n\nHowever, the life history of the family Potamotrygonidae\nunder natural conditions has been poorly studied (Garrone\nNeto &amp; Sazima, 2009a, b), since the majority of existing data\nare based on indirect observations, with this methodology\u2019s\ninherent limitations. In this sense, we have aimed to present\ninformation on patterns of activity and forms of habitat use\nby two co-occurring species of potamotrygonids, thereby\ncontributing to the better understanding of the way of life\nof these animals in their natural environment.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nStudy area. The present study was carried out in the upper\ncourse of the Paran\u00e1 River, Southeastern Brazil, between\n2005 and 2008. The investigations were concentrated in the\nmunicipalities of Castilho, SP and Tr\u00eas Lagoas, MS (about\n20\u00b047\u2019S 51\u00b037\u2019W), on the border of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo\nand Mato Grosso do Sul. Additional information was\nobtained from expeditions conducted in the municipality of\nPanorama, SP (21\u00b022\u2019S 51\u00b054\u2019W), in the region comprising\nthe lower reaches of the Tiet\u00ea (20\u00b040\u2019S 51\u00b025\u2019W) and\nParanapanema (22\u00b039\u2019S 53\u00b005\u2019W) rivers, and in the Ilha\nGrande National Park (24\u00b000\u2019S 54\u00b007\u2019W). These expeditions\ncomprised a stretch of approximately 350 kilometers which\nare under the influence of two hydroelectric dams:\nEngenheiro S\u00e9rgio Motta (Porto Primavera) and Engenheiro\nSouza Dias (Jupi\u00e1) (Fig. 1).\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification (Peel et\nal., 2007), the region has a Cfa or humid sub-tropical climate,\ncomprising two clearly defined seasons: one hot and rainy,\nwhich runs from the beginning of November through April,\nand the other dry and cooler, beginning in May and ending\naround October. In the dry period, when the underwater\nobservations were concentrated, the water from the rivers\nand marginal lakes has excellent transparency, which may\nreach depths of 6 to 8 meters, mainly in October.\n\nThe region comprising the upper Paran\u00e1 River has a long\nhistory of human occupation, with the deployment of large\nhydroelectric projects and few locations which have\nmaintained the original environmental characteristics (e. g.\nrapids and waterfalls). The substrate and the composition of\nthe banks range from muddy bottom with pasture present at\nthe water\u2019s edge, to sandy substrate with the presence of\n\nrocks, aquatic macrophytes and riparian vegetation. In order\nto represent a large number of these features, different\nlocations for observational studies were explored, with depths\nranging from 0.5 to 18 meters.\n\nPotamotrygonids species in the studied area. Of the three\nspecies of stingrays recorded in the upper Paran\u00e1 River\nbasin (Garrone Neto &amp; Haddad Jr., 2010), two were selected\nfor this study: Potamotrygon falkneri Castex &amp; Maciel, 1963\nand P. motoro (M\u00fcller &amp; Henle, 1841) (Fig. 2). Potamotrygon\nfalkneri is endemic to the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay River basin and\nits specific identity is well corroborated (Rosa, 1985; Silva\n&amp; Carvalho, 2011). Potamotrygon motoro integrate a set of\nmorphotypes widely distributed through the rivers of South\nAmerica and at least one new form was identified in the\nParan\u00e1 River basin, requiring further investigation for its\ndetermination (Rosa, 1985; Loboda, 2010). Therefore, two\nspecimens of each studied species were collected and stored\nin the fish collection of the Museu de Zoologia Prof. Dr.\nAd\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso - ZUEC/UNICAMP (voucher-specimens:\nZUEC 6331 - P. falkneri, and ZUEC 6332 - P. motoro), in a\n\nFig. 1. Illustrative map of the upper Paran\u00e1 River in the\nSoutheastern Brazil, showing the main rivers in the basin, the\nstudy location, and the places where expeditions were\nconducted to obtain additional data.\n\n\n\nD. G. Neto &amp; V. S. Uieda 83\n\nway to enable future verification and the potential revision\nof their identification.\n\nUnderwater observations. Data concerning activity and\nhabitat use were obtained during 112 hours of underwater\nobservations, comprised through random transects with the\nuse of self-contained diving technique (scuba diving) and\nfree diving (snorkeling) (Sabino, 1999). In order to detect\npossible temporal variations, we divided the daily cycle into\nthree time periods: day - from the total sunrise to the\nbeginning of sunset; dusk - from the period in which the\nsun is near to and below the horizon; night - from the total\nsunset until the beginning of sunrise. Data on the water\ntemperature and depth of the observation sites were obtained\nduring the dives using mercury thermometer and a graduate\nlead line, respectively, in order to verify possible correlations\nof these environmental variables with the behavior of the\nrays. In addition, data on the habitats occupied by the\nanimals at the time of the sightings were collected, aiming to\ninvestigate the use of the different types of environments\n(beach, flooded forest, stone, or grass), substrate type (sand,\nmuddy, or gravel), and places with presence or absence of\nhorizontal and/or vertical restrictions (i.e. structures used\nas shelters, like rocks, trunks, and macrophyte banks).\n\nThe scuba diving totaled 15 hours (day = 08 hours;\nnight = 05 hours; dusk = 02 hours) and was performed in\nlocations where the depth of the water was between eight\nand 18 meters. The free diving totaled 97 hours (day = 52\nhours; night = 29 hours; dusk = 16 hours) and was carried\no u t  i n  l o c a t i o n s  w i t h  d e p t h  l e s s  t h a n  1 2  m e t e r s .\nObservations were described according to a standard\nprotocol built for this study and recorded using digital\nphotography and video, and notes were made on PVC\nboards, based on methodology presented by Sazima (1986)\nand Sabino (1999). During the dives carried out at dusk\nand at night, we used indirect lighting and lamps with red\ncellophane filter in order to reduce the disturbance by the\nobserver (Helfman, 1992; Sabino, 1999).\n\nSpecies identification (based on the coloration of the animals\u2019\ndorsum) and sex identification (based on the presence of claspers\nin the males - easily observed dorsally) were done in situ during\nthe underwater observations, without the necessity of catching\nthe animals. The size of the observed individuals was estimated\nusing a hand net of known dimensions placed close to the\nanimals in a way to determine the disc width (DW, i.e. the distance\nbetween the extremities of the stingray\u2019s pectoral fins). A similar\nmethod has been successfully used to estimate the disc length\nof marine rays (e.g. Aguiar et al., 2009).\n\nFig. 2. Potamotrygon falkneri Castex &amp; Maciel, 1963 (female; DW = 43 cm) (a), and P. motoro (M\u00fcller &amp; Henle, 1841) (male;\nDW = 32 cm) (b).\n\n\n\nActivity and habitat use of two species of stingrays84\n\nData analysis. To ascertain potential relationship between\nthe observed individuals and environmental variables as\ntime period, depth, type of environment, substrate, and\nlocal with presence or absent of horizontal and/or vertical\nrestrictions, a Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA)\nwas conducted using the software Statistica 7.0\u00ae. Data\nabout temperature were not included in this analysis, but\nwere used to correlate this variable to the others analyzed.\nDuring underwater observations it was observed a similarity\namong species - but a difference between individuals of\ndifferent sizes - in relation to distribution and habitat use.\nIn function of these observations, the FCA analysis was\napplied to data grouped by size, without differentiation by\nspecies. According to disc width (DW) and sexual maturity\n(Garrone Neto, 2010), the individuals were divided into three\nsize classes: f1 (DW 15-25 cm), f2 (DW 26-45 cm) and f3\n(DW 46-65 cm).\n\nThe FCA is a graphical procedure which aims to represent\nthe associations of a contingency table; therefore it does\nnot take absolute values into consideration, but rather the\ncorrespondence between characters. This method analyses\nthe data frequency table via the chi-square distance, thereby\npermitting the object of the study to be linked to different\nvariables.\n\nResults\n\nIn total, 132 animals were observed, 62 of which were\nidentified as P. falkneri (males = 14; females = 48) and 70 as\nP. motoro (males = 17; females = 51; unidentified = 02). Of\nt h e s e  1 3 2  s i g h t i n g s ,  8 7  c o r r e s p o n d e d  t o  d a y t i m e\nobservations (65.9%), 34 at night time (25.8%), and 11 at\ndusk (8.3%). From the daytime observations, 42 were related\nto stationary animals (48.3%), 23 to roaming animals (26.4%),\n18 foraging (20.7%), and four were buried (4.6%). At night,\n24 stingrays were foraging (70.5%), five were roaming\n(14.7%), four were stationary (11.8%), and one was buried\n(3.0%). At dusk, eight individuals were involved in foraging\nactivity (73%), two were roaming (18%), one was stationary\n(9%), and none was buried.\n\nThe two studied species presented very similar patterns of\nnumber of individuals observed per size class, sex and time of\nthe day. They also presented very similar behavior. For both\nspecies there was a variation in the spatial distribution of the\nindividuals and the ways in which they use the habitat related\nto the size (disc width, DW), as shown in a schematic diagram\nproduced with the results of underwater observation (Fig. 3)\nand in the graphic representation of FCA analysis (Fig. 4).\n\nIn the main river channel, stingrays belonging to the\nsmaller size class (f1) were associated with the riverbanks,\nat depths between zero and four meters, in waters with about\n24\u00b0C (x = 23.8\u00baC; sd = 0.64) and over a predominantly sandy\nsubstrate, throughout the day cycle. For this size class, it\nwas common to observe intra-specific aggregations of up to\nfive stingrays resting, sometimes close to some kind of\nshelter, particularly tree trunks. Otherwise, in marginal lakes\n\nand in some stretches of the impoundment areas, these\nsmall stingrays showed behavioral variation related to time\nperiod, depth and temperature. In these lentic environments,\nwhere the temperature of the water approached 27\u00b0C in\ndepths up to three meters (x = 26.5\u00b0C; sd = 0.53), the\nindividuals remained in deeper places during the day, in\nwaters of about 24\u00baC (x = 24.2\u00b0C; sd = 0.70) and over muddy\nsubstrate. However, these small-sized stingrays were more\nactive at night and were observed approaching to shallow\nbanks, when the temperature of the water was about 24\u00baC\n(x = 23.7\u00baC; sd = 0.48).\n\nIntermediate-sized individuals (size class f2) were also\nfound in the river channel and in marginal lakes, frequently\nbetween zero and four meters depth and temperatures near\n23\u00baC (x = 23.3\u00baC; sd = 0.52), and showed greater activity during\nthe night. These individuals were associated to different types\nof environments, which ranged from rocky banks and stony\nbottom to places with low-growing riverbank vegetation,\nsandy substrates, tree trunks and macrophyte banks. In this\ngroup, many individuals were observed moving or foraging\nand, in some cases (n = 07), interacting with species of\nCichlidae during their feeding activity.\n\nLarge individuals (size class f3) were observed only in the\nriver channel. These stingrays were usually solitary and were\nrarely seen totally or partially buried in the substrate. For this\nsize class, the spatial distribution showed variation related to\ndepth and time period, with individuals occurring in deeper\nlocations (more than eight meters) during the day and in\nshallower sites (between 3-8 meters) during the night. During\nthe day they were observed over muddy or sandy substrates\nat the bottom of the river channel, resting in deeper waters at\ntemperatures around 22\u00baC (x = 21.6\u00b0C; sd = 0.74), sometimes\nnear some type of vertical restriction (e. g. shelters like rocks\nand macrophyte banks). These large stingrays were more\nactive at night, when they forage in shallow marginal places\nand temperatures near 24\u00baC (x = 24.2\u00b0C; sd = 0.70).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe use of underwater observation was shown to be of\ngreat relevance for the study of freshwater stingrays in their\nnatural environment, enabling the pioneering collection of\ndata related to their way of life. Excepting for difficulties during\nthe peak of the wet period (December to March), when there\nis a natural tendency for river visibility to be drastically\nreduced, the use of scuba and free diving techniques provided\nvaluable information about the periods of activity and the\nways of habitat use of P. falkneri and P. motoro, and made\npossible a preliminary understanding of their spatial\ndistribution in lentic and lotic environments.\n\nBoth species presented very similar patterns of spatial\ndistribution and of ways in which they use the habitat.\nPotamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro were considered\npredominantly nocturnal animals, particularly regarding\nfeeding activity. Studies suggested that various species\nof elasmobranchs are active during different periods of\n\n\n\nD. G. Neto &amp; V. S. Uieda 85\n\nt h e  d a y,  n o t a b l y  a t  n i g h t  ( A c k e r m a n  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ;\nSimpfendorfer &amp; Heupel, 2004). In many cases, this pattern\nof movement seems to be associated with different factors,\nsuch as foraging, thermoregulation, and anti-predation\nstrategies (Silliman &amp; Gruber, 1999; Matern et al., 2000;\nAguiar et al., 2009), or having a close relationship with\nenvironmental factors, such as the lunar phases or tide\nmovements (Smith &amp; Merriner, 1985; Cartamil et al., 2003;\nSimpfendorfer &amp; Heupel, 2004).\n\nThe behavior of P. falkneri and P. motoro showed\nontogenetic differences and a clear spatial segregation of\nindividuals, mainly in relation to water depth and period of\nday. The spatial distribution and period of activity of the\nstingrays also presented an interesting relationship with\nthe diet and the hunting tactics employed by P. falkneri and\nP. motoro in the study area. Class f1 stingrays are mainly\ninsectivorous (Silva &amp; Uieda, 2007) and use the hunting\ntactic namely \u201cundulate disc and stir substrate\u201d to uncover\nhidden prey in unconsolidated substrata (Garrone-Neto &amp;\nSazima, 2009a), both in lentic and lotic environments. As a\nresult, these individuals probably prefer to inhabit the\nriverbanks and shallow areas with predominantly sandy or\nmuddy substrate due to their feeding behavior during this\nstage of maturity.\n\nAguiar (2005) and Aguiar et al. (2009), studying the\nbehavior of the ray Dasyatis americana (Dasyatidae) on an\noceanic island in Northeastern Brazil, observed that the\nspatial distribution of young individuals (disc length &lt;35\ncm) was closely related to sandy beaches and shallow\nwaters, and that this size class was commonly observed in\naggregations in these sites. These authors assigned this\nfact primarily to anti-predatory strategies and secondarily\n\nto feeding strategies, and suggested the use of sandy\nbeaches by young individuals as nursery areas (Aguiar,\n2005; Aguiar et al., 2009). Despite P. falkneri and P. motoro\nnot being native to the upper Paran\u00e1 River basin and\npossessing a relatively recent history of occurrence in the\nstudy area (Vazzoler et al., 1997; Garrone Neto et al., 2007),\nit is possible that this behavior is also recurrent in these\ntaxa and among other species of potamotrygonids, with f1\n\nFig. 3. Distribution of individuals of P. falkneri and P. motoro of three size classes ((f1 = DW 15-25 cm, f2 = DW 26-45 cm, and\nf3 = DW 46-65 cm)) in the upper Paran\u00e1 River, illustrating the daily variation (day and night) in the occupation of shallower\nmarginal areas (in white) and deeper central areas (in gray), both in marginal lakes and in the main river channel.\n\nFig. 4. Graphical representation of the results of a Factorial\nCorrespondence Analysis (FCA): projection in factorial axes 1\nand 2 of frequencies of size classes (f1 = DW 15-25 cm, f2 = DW\n26-45 cm, and f3 = DW 46-65 cm) of the individuals according\nto habitat use, regarding period of the day, water depth, type of\nenvironment, and vertical and horizontal restrictions.\n\n\n\nActivity and habitat use of two species of stingrays86\n\nindividuals normally forming aggregations or looking for\nshelter in shallow waters in lotic environments, associated\nw i t h  s a n d y  b e a c h e s ,  o r  i n  d e e p e r  w a t e r s  i n  l e n t i c\nenvironments, associated with muddy substrates.\n\nThe large stingrays realized daily bathymetric migrations,\noccupying locations with different depths during the day\nand at night, especially for feeding purposes. At night, they\nwere observed searching for preys in shallow waters, mainly\nfreshwater shrimps (Palaemonidae) and small fishes (mostly\nCharaciformes), using predominantly the hunting tactic\nknown as \u201ccharging in the shallows\u201d (Garrone Neto &amp;\nSazima, 2009a). During the day, those individuals were\nobserved resting in deeper places, eventually moving and\nusing the hunting tactic known as \u201cundulate disc and stir\nsubstrate\u201d to prey upon aquatic insects and mollusks\n(Ampullariidae) (Garrone Neto &amp; Sazima, 2009a).\n\nMatern et al. (2000), in a study of movement patterns of\nthe bat ray Myliobatis californica (Myliobatidae) in Tomales\nBay (California/USA), based on information obtained by\nmeans of ultrasonic telemetry, suggested that the individuals\nof this species carried out daily movements with the aim of\nmaking the capture and digestion of food more efficient. In\nthis case, one of the factors which apparently exert a strong\ninfluence on the animals\u2019 patterns of movement is the water\ntemperature, with stingrays alternating their behavior\nbetween foraging in shallow warmer waters, located in the\nbay, and digestion in the open sea, with greater depth and\ncolder waters (Matern et al., 2000). This search for optimum\nfeeding temperatures seems to fit the model originally\ndescribed by McLaren (1963), where the post-foraging\nrelocation to cooler places reduces the energy demands of\nthe metabolism, by providing additional energy on account\nof the reduction in the rate of gastric evacuation (Parrish &amp;\nMargraf, 1990; Cortes &amp; Gruber, 1992), while food\nassimilation efficiency is maintained (Brett, 1971) or possibly\nintensified (Wetherbee &amp; Gruber, 1990). To the size class f3\nthe temperature variation was not significant in this study,\nalthough large individuals of P. falkneri and P. motoro\nshowed a strong association of feeding activity with depths\nunder four meters and at temperatures close to 24\u00b0C at night,\nand resting activity with places where the depth is over\neight meters and the temperatures are near 22\u00b0C at day.\n\nThe intermediate-sized stingrays (class f2) occupied a\ngreat diversity of environments and comprised the most\nactive of the three studied size classes. Individuals of this\nsize class are known to eat a wide variety of items in the\nstudy area, including aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans,\nsmall fishes, and even residues of artisanal and sport fisheries\n(Silva &amp; Uieda, 2007; Garrone Neto &amp; Uieda, 2009), using\nthe two hunting tactics mentioned previously and another\none, least common, known as \u201cpicking up prey on vertical\nand inclined substrata above water surface\u201d (Garrone Neto\n&amp; Sazima, 2009a). Those behaviors demonstrated the great\nflexibility of these individuals in the exploitation of resources\n(habitat and food), while f1 individuals were basically\n\nrestricted to shallow areas and to a diet composed mainly of\ninsects, and f3 individuals consumed snails, shrimps and\nsmall fishes. The versatility of the hunting behavior of\nPotamotrygon spp. (Garrone Neto &amp; Sazima, 2009a) also\ncontributed to the interspecific interactions observed\nbetween P. falkneri and P. motoro and some species of\ncichlids (Garrone Neto &amp; Sazima, 2009b), and to their recent\nand successful colonization of new areas and habitats in\nthe upper Paran\u00e1 River basin (Garrone Neto et al., 2007;\nGarrone Neto &amp; Haddad Jr., 2010).\n\nOntogenetic variations in diet and in feeding behavior are\nknown for some species of elasmobranchs (e.g. Ebert, 2002;\nSisneros &amp; Tricas, 2002; Wetherbee &amp; Cort\u00e9s, 2004). The\ndistribution of individuals in the environment may also have a\nclose relationship with their stage of development, as indicated\nby the data obtained for P. falkneri and P. motoro in this study.\nThe field observations and the FCA analysis (see Fig. 4)\nshowed that f3 individuals alternate their position throughout\nthe day cycle (bathymetric migration), approaching the banks\nduring the night, whereas f1 stingrays are strongly associated\nwith beach and sandy substrate environments, and the f2 class\nis present in different environments and depths, associated\nwith rocks and vegetation. Seasonal variations in activity,\nspatial distribution and habitat use of the species of stingrays\nhere studied may likely occur, but as the peak of the rainy\nperiod impairs the use of underwater observations in the\nupper Paran\u00e1 River basin, only the use of biotelemetry or\nother similar technology (see Simpfendorfer &amp; Heupel, 2004\nfor overviews) may enable the acquisition of these information\nand expand our knowledge of the behavior of\npotamotrygonids in their natural environment.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe gathering of data would not have been possible without\nthe exceptional collaboration of Cl\u00e1udia E.
