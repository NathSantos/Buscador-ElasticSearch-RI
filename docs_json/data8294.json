The ray species involved in such association are Potamotrygon falkneri\nand P. motoro, whose activity attract four cichlid species, namely Crenicichla britskii, Satanoperca pappaterra, Cichla\nkelberi, and Geophagus proximus, the two latter non-native species to the study area. The cichlids approach a ray when it\nbegins to stir the substrate and form sediment clouds, and remain close to the ray during this activity only. The association is\nhere regarded as following behavior even if very transient.\n\nUma t\u00e1tica de ca\u00e7a das raias de \u00e1gua doce (Potamotrygonidae), chamada de \u201condular o disco e agitar o substrato\u201d, \u00e9 aqui\nrelatada como atrativa para Cichlidae em dois locais da bacia do alto rio Paran\u00e1.

So called following association comprise a fish or a\nfish group that excavate or otherwise disturb the substrate\nwhile foraging, and one or more opportunistic species that\ncapitalize on the small animals and other food types displaced\nby the foraging activity of the former (Strand, 1988; Lukoschek\n&amp; McCormick, 2000). This association is a well-known one in\nthe marine environment (see Strand, 1988; Sazima et al., 2007\nfor overviews), although a few instances are reported from\nfreshwater habitats as well (e.g., Sazima, 1986; Baker &amp; Foster,\n1994; Leit\u00e3o et al., 2007; Teresa &amp; Carvalho, 2008).\n\nSeveral species of rays (particularly of the Myliobatoidei)\nforage with use of a tactic we termed \u201cundulate the disc and\nstir substrate\u201d, as illustrated by species of the freshwater\n\nPotamotrygonidae (Garrone-Neto &amp; Sazima, 2009). Here we\nreport on four cichlid species attracted to the stirring by two\nPotamotrygon species at two sites in the upper rio Paran\u00e1,\nSouthwestern Brazil.\n\nThe study sites are in the vicinity of Campinal, SP (about\n21\u00b032\u2019S 52\u00b003\u2019W) and Tr\u00eas Lagoas, MS (about 20\u00b047\u2019S\n51\u00b037\u2019W) on the border of S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do\nSul, Southeastern Brazil. The association and the behavior of\nthe fishes were recorded underwater while snorkeling or\nscuba-diving (Sabino, 1999) at day and night hours in the\nmiddle of the dry season in August and at the onset of the\nrainy season in November 2007 and 2008. A total of 84 h of\nunderwater observations was made through the study, most\nof them with snorkeling (78 h at depths of 0.5 to 12 m) and the\nremainder time with scuba-diving (6 h at depths of 8-18 m).\n\n\n\nCichlid fishes associate with foraging potamotrygonid rays500\n\n\u201cAd libitum\u201d and \u201cbehaviour\u201d sampling rules (Martin &amp;\nBateson, 1986) were used throughout the observational\nsessions, mostly recorded on a plastic slate (Garrone-Neto &amp;\nSazima, 2009). Size estimates (total length TL for the cichlids,\nand disc width DW for the rays) were calibrated against actual\nspecimens or objects of known size.\n\nThe beginning of association may be conveniently\nexemplified by a ray stirring the unconsolidated (loose)\nsubstrate to uncover small invertebrates such as insect larvae,\ncrabs, and snails. This activity stirs the substrate particles\nand discrete sediment clouds are formed near the foraging\nray (Fig. 1). These clouds apparently catch the attention of\nnearby cichlids that approach the ray and feed on small preys\nand other food types exposed this way (Fig. 2). Clouds of\nsand and other sediment types are one of the most important\nvisual cues for followers to approach a substrate-disturbing\nfish (e.g., Fricke, 1975; Fishelson, 1977; Sazima et al., 2006;\nLeit\u00e3o et al., 2007).\n\nCichlids were attracted to foraging activity of P. falkneri (n\n= 6) and P. motoro (n = 1). We recorded four cichlid species\nattracted to rays, namely Crenicichla britskii, Satanoperca\n\nfood types such as plant debris (see Sazima, 1986 for S.\npappaterra). The duration of the association varied 8-1,320 sec\n(x = 12,1; sd = 4,94; N = 7). While close to the ray, the cichlids\nwere unusually wary and do not allowed close approach of the\nobserver (this behavior also precluded photographs). No\ncichlid or any other fish was recorded close to rays foraging at\nnight. From a total of 42 recorded instances of rays\u2019 foraging\nover unconsolidated bottoms, association with cichlids was\nrecorded for only seven (17%) of these. Thus, the association\nmay be regarded as rare, possibly related to the recent\ncolonization of the upper Paran\u00e1 River by potamotrygonid rays\n(Garrone-Neto et al., 2007; Garrone-Neto, 2009).\n\nAlthough the cichlids only approached the ray while it\nwas already stirring the substrate, the association is here\nregarded as following behavior even if a very transient one\n(see Sazima et al., 2007; Leit\u00e3o et al., 2007; Teresa &amp; Carvalho,\n2008). The association between cichlids and rays was recorded\nin still water (marginal ponds and dammed river portions),\nwhich favors sediment deposition. This latter, in turn, favors\n\u201ccloud\u201d formation during foraging by rays and attracts\nzoobenthivorous and opportunistic cichlids. No association\n\nFig. 1. A freshwater ray (Potamotrygon motoro) forages with\nuse of \u201cundulate the disc and stir substrate\u201d tactic. Note fine\nclouds of sediment adjacent to the ray.\n\nFig. 2. Association between a foraging freshwater ray\n(Potamotrygon falkneri) and two species of cichlid fishes\n(Crenicichla britskii on the left and Geophagus proximus\non the right). The ray settles close to the bottom, begins to\nundulate the disc and stir the substrate, which cause the\ncichlid to approach (a); as the ray proceeds foraging and\nforms a fine sediment cloud, the cichlids hover head-down\nclose to the disc and watches potential prey to be uncovered\nby the ray\u2019s movements (b).\n\npappaterra, Cichla kelberi and Geophagus proximus, the two\nlatter non-native species introduced about a decade ago in the\nupper Paran\u00e1 River for fishery purposes (Gra\u00e7a &amp; Pavanelli,\n2007). From these, the species most commonly recorded\nassociated with a ray were C. britskii (n = 3), Geophagus\nproximus (n = 2), and C. kelberi (n = 2). The cichlids\u2019 sizes\nvaried from about 6 cm TL (C. britskii, G. proximus, and S.\npappaterra) to about 14 cm (C. kelberi), and the rays\u2019 sizes\nvaried from 32 to 45 cm DW. Thus, in most instances both the\nrays and the cichlids were juveniles.\n\nUp to four individuals of two cichlid species were attracted\nto a single ray (Fig. 2). Once close to a foraging ray (Fig. 2a),\nthe cichlids hovered head-down near the ray\u2019s undulating disc\n(Fig. 2b), watched intently and lunged forwards to snatch\ndisturbed small prey (mostly larval aquatic insects) and other\n\n\n\nD. Garrone-Neto &amp; I. Sazima 501\n\nwas ever recorded for rays hunting in flowing water.\nIt is noteworthy that no characid species was recorded\n\nclose to foraging rays, as tetras are opportunistic foragers\nand a few species are already reported as followers of\nsubstrate-disturbing fishes (Sazima, 1986; Teresa &amp; Carvalho,\n2008). Although not much probable, one explanation could\nbe that the rays prey occasionally on small characids\n(Lonardoni et al., 2006; Garrone-Neto, 2009). However, further\nfield studies may disclose additional associations of fishes\nother than cichlids and even other aquatic animals with\nforaging freshwater rays.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe greatly thank Ottilie Carolina Forster e Laura Furlan\nLuvisoto for help during fieldwork at the Tr\u00eas Lagoas area;\nMarcos Teixeira da Silveira, diving fisherman of the Col\u00f4nia\nZ-3/MS gave us valuable information about the rays and the\nstudy sites; logistic support at the Universidade Federal de\nMato Grosso do Sul - Campus Tr\u00eas Lagoas was possible\nthrough the kindness of Maria Jos\u00e9 Alencar Vilela; part of\nfinancial support went through the kindness of Virg\u00ednia\nSanches Uieda (PROAP-CAPES/UNESP); both authors are\ngrantees of the CNPq; two anonymous referees provided their\ntime and valuable suggestions.\n\nLiterature Cited\n\nBaker, J.
