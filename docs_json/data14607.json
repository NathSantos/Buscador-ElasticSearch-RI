Purpose: The aim\nof this in vitro study was to perform a qualitative analysis of the human enamel after the application of in-office bleaching agents, using Scanning\nElectron Microscopy (SEM). Materials and Methods: Twenty intact human third molars extracted for orthodontic reasons were randomly divided\ninto four groups (n=5) treated as follows: G1- storage in artificial saliva (control group); G2- four 30-minute applications of 35% carbamide\nperoxide (total exposure: 2h); G3- four 2-hour exposures to 35% carbamide peroxide (total exposure: 8h); G4- two applications of 35% hydrogen\nperoxide, which was light-activated with halogen lamp at 700mW/cm2 during 7min and remained in contact with enamel for 20min (total\nexposure: 40min). All bleaching treatments adopted in this study followed the application protocols advised by manufacturers. Evaluation of\ngroups submitted to 35% carbamide peroxide was carried out after two time intervals (30 minutes and 2 hours per session), following the extreme\nsituations recommended by the manufacturer. Specimens were prepared for SEM analysis performing gold sputter coating under vacuum and were\nexamined using 15kV at 500x and 2000x magnification. Results: Morphological alterations on the enamel surface were similarly detected after\nbleaching with either 35% carbamide peroxide or 35% hydrogen peroxide. Surface porosities were characteristic of an erosive process that took\nplace on human enamel. Depression areas, including the formation of craters, and exposure of enamel rods could also be detected. Conclusion:\nBleaching effects on enamel morphology were randomly distributed throughout enamel surface and various degrees of enamel damage could be\nnoticed. Clinical significance: In-office bleaching materials may adversely affect enamel morphology and therefore should be used with caution.\nUniterms: Hydrogen peroxide; Carbamide peroxide; Tooth bleaching.\n\n  esde o aumento da popularidade de tratamentos clareadores, o interesse em se pesquisar os efeitos dos per\u00f3xidos nos tecidos dentais duros \u00e9\ncrescente.

Inevitably, the request of whiter teeth\nhas become a major concern in dental practice since\ndiscoloration of a single tooth or a group of teeth negatively\ninterferes with the harmony of smile. Although tooth color\nis only one of the aspects involved in facial harmony, it\nrepresents the most important isolated factor because it is\nimmediately noticed1.\n\nEsthetic dentistry has introduced various corrective\nmeasures to treat discolored teeth, such as laminate veneers,\ndirect resin restorations, crowns or fixed prostheses. Dental\nbleaching represents a conservative treatment option or may\nbecome an auxiliary therapy when restorative procedures\nare required to eliminate color abnormalities2.\n\nBleaching agents are provided for in-office or at-home\ntherapies. In-office bleaching requires less patient\u2019s\ncooperation, but longer sessions are necessary in the dental\noffice, which increases the treatment costs. Otherwise, at-\nhome bleaching is less expensive, but patient\u2019s collaboration\nis essential to obtain successful treatment results3.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is the main active ingredient of\nbleaching agents and the whitening effect it produces is\ndue to its low molecular weight and its ability to penetrate\nthrough enamel and dentin1,4. The basic process involves\noxidation and reduction reactions that convert organic\npigments into carbon dioxide and water1,5. Carbamide\nperoxide decomposes into urea and hydrogen peroxide5.\nTherefore, products containing the same concentration but\ndifferent active ingredients are expected to behave\ndifferently on dental hard tissues. Such behavior might\nbecome even more evident when considering regular or\nlight-activated gels or distinct exposure periods.\n\nAlthough dental hard tissues are highly mineralized, their\norganic content can play an important role in the bleaching\nprocess. It is speculated that the reaction between peroxide\nand organic materials on the surface or in the subsurface of\nenamel can result in morphological alterations6.\n\nDespite the advantages offered by the bleaching\ntreatment, the effect of bleaching agents on dental hard\ntissues is rather controversial. Some studies have\ndemonstrated no significant effects of bleaching agents on\nhuman enamel 4,7. Contrary results have shown\nmorphological alterations on bleached enamel, thus\nsuggesting an erosive process8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nSince bleaching has been widely advocated by dental\nprofessionals, the effect of bleaching agents on dental hard\ntissues is of great interest in research. Therefore, the purpose\nof this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of in-\noffice bleaching agents on human enamel morphology,\ncomparing 35% carbamide peroxide or 35% light-activated\nhydrogen peroxide.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis study was developed in accordance with the Code\nof Ethics in Research (n\u00ba063/2001 PH/CEP). Twenty intact\nhuman third molars extracted for orthodontic reasons were\nselected for this study. Immediately after extraction,\nperiodontal tissue was removed and teeth were stored in\nsaline solution at -20\u00b0C for a maximum period of 28 days12.\nPrior to group division, teeth were examined at a\nstereomicroscope Stemi 2000 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at\n20x magnification to select teeth without cracks or structural\ndefects that could compromise the results of the study.\n\nAll teeth were submitted to mesio-distal crosscut\nsections to separate buccal and lingual fragments. Horizontal\nsections were performed at the cementoenamel junction,\nseparating coronary and root pieces. Buccal sections were\nselected for the SEM analysis and randomly divided into\nfour groups of five specimens each, treated as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Group 1: no bleaching treatment was performed. All\nbuccal sections were kept in artificial saliva at 37\u00baC until\nSEM analysis was performed.\n\n\u00b7 Group 2: buccal sections were placed in contact with\n35% carbamide peroxide (Opalescence Quick, batch #479B,\nUltradent, South Jordan, Utah, United States), facing a Petri\ndish containing the gel. Product was heated in warm water\nprior to use, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation.\nSpecimens were kept in contact with the bleaching agent\nfor 30 minutes. Next, specimens were rinsed with distilled\nwater and stored in artificial saliva at 37\u00b0C. This procedure\nwas repeated weekly in four applications (total exposure:\n2h).\n\n\u00b7 Group 3: bleaching protocol followed steps determined\nfor group 3, but adopting a longer exposure period. Two-\nhour applications of 35% carbamide peroxide (Opalescence\nQuick, batch #479B, Ultradent, South Jordan, Utah, United\nStates) were performed weekly for four weeks (total exposure:\n8h). Variation in the exposure period was determined since\nthe manufacturer suggested a minimum of 30-minute and\nmaximum of 2-hour exposure. Therefore, minimum time\nexposure was investigated in group 2 while maximum\nexposure period was evaluated in group 3.\n\n\u00b7 Group 4: two 20-minute applications of 35% hydrogen\nperoxide (Opalescence X-tra, batch #532B, Ultradent, South\nJordan, Utah, United States) were performed in accordance\nto manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Gel was applied on\nenamel specimens and light-activation was performed\ninitially for 5 minutes. The light source used was Curing\nLight XL3000 (3M ESPE) at 700mW/cm2. Four extra 30-\nsecond light-activations were carried out every 3.5min during\nthe 15-minute period that the gel remained in contact with\nenamel. Therefore, total light activation was performed for 7\nminutes during gel contact of 20 minutes. Teeth were rinsed\nwith distilled water to remove the gel and bleaching protocol\nwas repeated (total exposure: 40 minutes).\n\nAfter carrying out bleaching protocols, teeth were rinsed\nand stored in artificial saliva at 37\u00baC for 24 hours. The artificial\nsaliva contained calcium chloride (0.16g), sodium benzoate\n(1g), carboxymethyl cellulose (10g), magnesium chloride\n\n205\n\nEVALUATION OF THE BLEACHED HUMAN ENAMEL BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY\n\n\n\n(0.05g), potassium chloride (0.62g), sodium chloride (0.82g),\nsodium fluoride (4.29g), sorbitol (42.74g), potassium\nphosphate (1.12g), and distilled water up to 100ml. Teeth\nwere rinsed thoroughly prior to SEM investigation.\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\ninvestigation\n\nTwenty-four hours after bleaching, specimens were\ndehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol. Twenty-minute\nimmersion in each solution was performed at concentrations\nof 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% ethanol. Sixty-minute\nimmersion in 100% ethanol was carried out. Specimens dried\nat room temperature during 12 hours. Crowns were fixed in\naluminum stubs and then sputter-coated with gold-\npalladium (Desk II, Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ, United\nStates) during 2 minutes.\n\nEnamel surface was examined at 500x and 2000x\nmagnification with scanning electron microscope (JMS 5310,\nJEOL, Tokyo, Japan), using 15kV. A scanning of the entire\nbuccal surface was performed and most critical areas were\nselected for scanning electron microscope\nphotomicrographs.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 1 depicts unbleached enamel. Although the\nsurface is not completely smooth, uniformity of the aprismatic\nsurface layer can be observed. Pores and superficial\nirregularities were also present.\n\nEffects of bleaching were randomly distributed on enamel\nsurface after the application of in-office products (Figures\n2, 3, 4, and 5). In fact, different types of defects and distinct\nseverity of such events could be observed throughout the\nenamel surface. Modification of enamel morphology was\n\ndetected either after 35% carbamide peroxide (Figures 2 and\n3) or 35% hydrogen peroxide applications (Figures 4 and 5).\nIn general, it seems that bleaching evidenced original\nirregularities present on enamel surface. Morphologic\nsurface alterations became much more pronounced after\nbleaching, including partial removal of the aprismatic layer,\nincreased depth of enamel grooves, and exposure of the\nenamel prisms (Figures 2B, 4A, 4B and 5B). An increased\nnumber of porosities on enamel surface could be noticed\n(Figures 2A and 5A), when compared to the control group\n(Figure 1). Intermittent depressions of various depths were\npresent (Figures 3A, 3B, 4A and 5B); craters (Figure 2B),\nand shallow erosions (Figures 2A and 5A) could also be\nobserved.\n\nSimilar observations were detected on enamel\nmorphology of teeth treated with either conventional\ncarbamide peroxide gel or light-activated hydrogen peroxide.\nIt must be emphasized, however, that the irregularities found\non enamel surface  were more frequently distributed in the\nexperimental groups, but were also detected on the\nunbleached enamel.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEffects of bleaching agents on enamel surface have been\ndiscussed recently. When considering in-office bleaching\nagents, controversial results have been reported. Thirty-\nfive percent hydrogen peroxide applications did not produce\nmorphological alterations on enamel in research conducted\nby Ernst, el al.7. Likewise, Gultz, et al.13, who adopted the\nsame methods of this study and tested the same bleaching\nagents (Opalescence Quick and Opalescence X-tra), did not\nreport significant alterations on the enamel surface. However,\nexposure periods determined in their study were shorter\n(total exposures of 2 hours for 35% carbamide peroxide and\n\nFIGURE 1- Photomicrographs of unbleached enamel (control group) at 500x (A) and 2000x magnifications (B)\n\n206\n\nMIRANDA C B, PAGANI C, BENETTI A R, MATUDA F da S\n\n\n\n8 to 10 minutes for 35% light-activated hydrogen peroxide)\nthan those stipulated for this investigation (total exposures\nof 2 or 8 hours for 35% carbamide peroxide and 40 minutes\nfor 35% light-activated hydrogen peroxide).\n\nIn this study, defects could be randomly detected on the\nenamel surface with distinct severity after bleaching. Similar\nbehavior has been reported in previous studies, even after\n10% carbamide peroxide bleaching, which releases lower\namounts of hydrogen peroxide when compared to in-office\nbleaching agents. Surface erosion9, depressions14, porosity,\nand increased depth of enamel grooves6 were some of the\nalterations mentioned.\n\nMore severe alterations could be expected on enamel\nsurface after in-office bleaching. Increased porosity14,15 and\nprecipitate deposition16 characterized enamel erosion9,17,18.\n\nDepressions6, 19 with crater formation, removal of the\naprismatic layer and exposure of the enamel prisms15,17 could\nalso be detected. Heged\u00fcs, et al.6 detected a pronounced\nincrease in the depth of enamel grooves after 30% hydrogen\nperoxide bleaching. McGuckin, et al. 1 9 reported\nmorphological alterations on enamel surface, describing\nenamel patterns similar to type II acid etching, after 30%\nhydrogen peroxide applications.\n\nAlthough 35% hydrogen peroxide presents higher\nconcentration of free hydrogen peroxide when compared to\n35% carbamide peroxide gel, no visual difference was\ndetected between groups treated with such products. Similar\nresults were probably observed due to the shorter exposure\nperiods and fewer sessions determined for the light-activated\ngel.\n\nFIGURE 2- Photomicrographs of bleached enamel after 35% carbamide peroxide applications at 500x (A and B) and 2000x\nmagnifications (C and D): removal of the aprismatic layer, craters, pores, and erosion\n\n207\n\nEVALUATION OF THE BLEACHED HUMAN ENAMEL BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY\n\n\n\nAuthors believe that enamel alterations are probably\ndue to an initial process of demineralization. McCracken\nand Haywood20 and Rotstein, et al.21 have proven loss of\ncalcium in teeth exposed to peroxide. Rotstein, et al.22\nobserved lower resistance and higher solubility of dental\nhard tissues after bleaching procedures, possibly due to\nmodification of the organic and inorganic ratio of the tissues.\nOltu and G\u00fcrgan23 observed changes in the inorganic\ncomposition of the bleached enamel after 35% carbamide\nperoxide exposure. Indeed, most bleaching agents are acidic,\nwhich is not favorable to enamel, dentin, and cement. The\npH of bleaching agents investigated in this study was 6.4\nand 3.8 for 35% carbamide peroxide (Opalescence Quick)\nand 35% hydrogen peroxide (Opalescence X-tra),\nrespectively.\n\nAlthough artificial saliva was used in this study to\nsimulate oral conditions, its remineralization potential is not\nequivalent to natural saliva in vivo. Fewer alterations are\nexpected in vivo, due to the buffer capacity of saliva.\nRodrigues, et al.24 reminded that saliva and fluoride ions\npresent in oral care substances are essential to equilibrate\nthe demineralization and remineralization processes.\nAccording to Lopes, et al.25, pH values as low as 6.4 may\nremove minerals from teeth in in vitro situations; thus,\nartificial saliva might not be able to guarantee remineralization.\n\nIn vivo or in vitro bleaching, various concentrations\nand exposure periods to bleaching agents, use of different\nsubstances prior to treatment, sample size, and evaluation\ncriteria are distinct among different research studies. Thus,\na comparison between studies becomes rather difficult.\n\nFIGURE 3- Photomicrographs of bleached enamel after 35% carbamide peroxide applications at 500x (A and B) and 2000x\nmagnifications (C and D): depressions and increased depth of enamel irregularities\n\n208\n\nMIRANDA C B, PAGANI C, BENETTI A R, MATUDA F da S\n\n\n\nHowever, most papers are in agreement with findings\nreported in this study, which detected significant changes\non the enamel surface after bleaching with concentrated\nhydrogen or carbamide peroxide. Therefore, caution is\nrequired when performing in-office bleaching.\n\nSignificant changes in the enamel morphology and\nmicrostructure produced by bleaching agents are\nsuggestive of alterations in physical and mechanical\nproperties of dental hard tissues10, 25, 26, 27. Indeed, further\nstudies are necessary to completely understand the effects\nof bleaching agents on dental tissues.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSEM qualitative investigation demonstrated that in-\noffice bleaching agents affected human enamel morphology,\nproducing porosities, depressions, craters, increased depth\nof enamel grooves, and partial removal of enamel prisms.\nThese defects were randomly distributed and affected the\nenamel surface at various degrees.\n\nClinical implications\n\nIn-office bleaching materials may adversely affect enamel\nmorphology and therefore should be used with caution.\n\nFIGURE 4- Photomicrographs of bleached enamel after 35% hydrogen peroxide applications at 500x (A and B) and 2000x\nmagnifications (C and D): depressions, removal of the aprismatic layer, and increased depth of enamel irregularities\n\n209\n\nEVALUATION OF THE BLEACHED HUMAN ENAMEL BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY\n\n\n\nFIGURE 5- Photomicrographs of bleached enamel after 35% hydrogen peroxide applications at 500x (A and B) and 2000x\nmagnifications (C and D): partial removal of the aprismatic layer, pores, depressions and erosions\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1- Baratieri LN.
