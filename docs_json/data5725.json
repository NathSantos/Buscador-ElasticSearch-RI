Tns study aimed to compare reproductive traits associated to life-history theory for three Hyphessobrycon species from two lentic environments (four natural oxbow lakes and a manmade reservoir) of Mogi Gua\u00e7u River, upper Paran\u00e1 River basin. Methods: Specimens were collected with four minnow traps between August 2005 and July 2006 to cover dry and wet seasons (three samples in each season, and three samples in each environment). Results: Reproductive strategy of H. bifasciatus and H. eques, which predominated in the oxbow lakes, differed from H. anisitsi in the reservoir. Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus and H. eques were single spawners with lower fecundity and size at sexual maturity, but invested more in number of eggs per body gram, while H. anisitsi was a multiple spawner species with higher fecundity, larger size at sexual maturity and body size. Conclusions: In seasonal environments, single spawners are synchronized with the floods to maximize juvenile survivorship, while reservoirs harbors multiple spawners' fish due to the reduced fluctuation between high and low floods resulting from dam operation. Therefore, the seasonal condition in the oxbow lakes due to the flood pulse favored single spawners' tactic, as showed by H. bifasciatus and H. eques. In contrast, the multiple spawning of H. anisitsi seems to be related to the more stable environmental condition throughout the year provided by the dam. Life-histories reported herein to Hyphessobrycon species must be common to other characid fishes inhabiting similar environments.\nKeywords: tetra fishes, spawning, fecundity, body condition.\nResumo: Objetivo: Em peixes, as estrat\u00e9gias de hist\u00f3ria de vida incluem par\u00e2metros relacionados com a sobreviv\u00eancia da prole, fecundidade e per\u00edodo reprodutivo, e representam caracter\u00edsticas adaptativas que permitem uma esp\u00e9cie lidar com a variabilidade espacial e temporal das condi\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas.

M\u00e9todos: Os exemplares foram coletados com quatro armadilhas do tipo covo entre Agosto de 2005 e Julho de 2006 para abranger as esta\u00e7\u00f5es seca e chuvosa (tr\u00eas amostras em cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o e tr\u00eas amostras em cada ambiente). Resultados: A estrat\u00e9gia reprodutiva de H. bifasciatus e H. eques, que ocorreram principalmente nas lagoas marginais, diferiu de H. anisitsi no reservat\u00f3rio. Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus e H. eques foram classificados como desovadores\n\u00fanicos, com fecundidade e tamanho de matura\u00e7\u00e3o gonadal menor, mas investiram mais em n\u00famero de ov\u00f3citos por peso corp\u00f3reo, enquanto H. anisitsi foi classificado como desovador m\u00faltiplo, com fecundidade, tamanho de matura\u00e7\u00e3o gonadal e corp\u00f3reo maior. Conclus\u00f5es: Em ambientes sazonais, os desovadores totais est\u00e3o sincronizados com o per\u00edodo de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o para maximizar a sobreviv\u00eancia da prole, enquanto reservat\u00f3rios abrigam desovadores m\u00faltiplos, devido \u00e0 flutua\u00e7\u00e3o reduzida entre inunda\u00e7\u00f5es resultante da opera\u00e7\u00e3o da represa. Dessa forma, a condi\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal das lagoas marginais devido ao pulso de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o, favorece a t\u00e1tica reprodutiva dos desovadores totais, como apresentado por H. bifasciatus e H. eques. Ao contr\u00e1rio, a desova m\u00faltipla de H. anisitsi parece estar relacionada com a condi\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental mais est\u00e1vel do ambiente ao longo do ano devido ao represamento. As hist\u00f3rias de vida registradas aqui para as esp\u00e9cies de Hyphessobrycon devem ser comuns para outras esp\u00e9cies de carac\u00eddeos que habitam ambientes similares.\nPalavras-chave: carac\u00eddeos, desova, fecundidade, condi\u00e7\u00e3o corp\u00f3rea.\n1.\tIntroduction\nThe Neotropical region has the most diversified freshwater fish fauna in the world (Leveque et al., 2008) accompanied by an important diversity of life-history patterns (Winemiller, 1989). Lifehistory strategies in fish include essential parameters related to offspring survivorship, fecundity and time of reproduction, which represent adaptive traits that enable a species to deal with spatial and temporal variability of abiotic conditions, food availability and predation pressure (Winemiller, 1989, 1992, 2005; Winemiller and Rose, 1992). A current life-history model for fish (Winemiller, 1989; Winemiller and Rose, 1992) describes a \u201ctriangular pattern\u201d in which three endpoints classifies the species as \u201cequilibrium\u201d, \u201copportunistic\u201d, or \u201cseasonal\u201d strategists, according to fishes' mortality, generation time, fecundity, and other factors. Vila-Gispert et al. (2002) showed that basic lifehistories patterns of fishes from North and South America, Europe, and Atlantic and Pacific oceans are convergent, i.e., fishes exhibit similar responses to equivalent selection pressures, reinforcing that the three endpoints model represent a general pattern in nature. Reproductive traits can be related to some environmental constraints (Wootton, 1992), allowing a better understanding of the responses of the species to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. Such knowledge may also facilitate management decisions regarding the mitigation of environmental impacts on aquatic systems (Olden and Kennard, 2010; Winemiller, 2005).\nRivers damming is one of the most impacting actions upon lotic ecosystems across the world. Damming disrupts the longitudinal continuum of physical and biological features of the river basin (Dugan et al., 2010; Welcomme et al., 2006), and creates a new environment with different\nhydrologic condition, deeply modifying the original fish communities (Agostinho et al., 2008). The hydrological variability may act as a selective filter for fish species in function of its life-histories traits (i.e. reproductive strategies) (Tedesco et al., 2008). In this sense, both floodplain dynamic and habitat heterogeneity are important factors influencing fish reproduction in river-floodplain systems (Zeug and Winemiller, 2007). Therefore, damming a river stretch can influence a whole set of life-history traits of fishes, especially those related to reproduction (Agostinho et al., 1999).\nThe genus Hyphessobrycon Durbin includes 97 valid species distributed from southern Mexico to the La Plata River in Argentina, and is by far one of the most speciose genera within the Characidae (Lima and Moreira, 2003). The diversity of this genus provides an opportunity to investigate life-history variation among related species across a wide variety of environmental conditions. Hyphessobrycon anisitsi (Eigenmann, 1907), H. bifasciatus Ellis, 1911 and H. eques (Steindachner, 1882) are originally found in Paran\u00e1 and Uruguay River basins (H. anisitsi), rivers of eastern Brazil and upper Paran\u00e1 (H. bifasciatus), and in Amazon and Paraguay basins (H. eques). Actually, H. eques are widespread through the upper Paran\u00e1 River basin and rivers of eastern Brazil as a result of introductions (Buckup et al., 2007). These smallbodied sized species are quite abundant in the Mogi Gua\u00e7u River, in which they have been recorded in different kinds of environments such as streams, rivers, oxbow lakes and reservoir (Meschiatti and Arcifa, 2009). Gon\u00e7alves and Braga (2008) verified that these Hyphessobrycon species are among the most abundant fishes in lentic environments (oxbow lakes and a reservoir) in Mogi Gua\u00e7u River.\nIn the present study, life-history patterns of H. anisitsi, H. bifasciatus and H. eques were investigated based on fecundity, spawning type, body size, body condition, and size at sexual maturity, in four oxbow lakes and in the reservoir of a Small Hydroelectric Power plant (SHP) of the Mogi Gua\u00e7u River (S\u00e3o Paulo State, southeast Brazil), in order to compare their reproductive strategies in these lentic environments.\n2.\tMaterial and Methods\n2.1.\tStudy area\nThe Mogi Gua\u00e7u River has an extension of 473 km, and rises in the Mantiqueira mountain range at 1,650 m (Minas Gerais State), southeast Brazil. The four oxbow lakes studied (Pedra, Catingueiro, Barrinha and Fund\u00e3o) are located at Mogi Gua\u00e7u Ecological Station (Mogi Gua\u00e7u municipality, S\u00e3o Paulo State), a conservation unit with 980.71 ha, also known as Campininha farm (22\u00b0 16' S and 47\u00b012\u2019 W). These are small permanent oxbow lakes seasonally connected to Mogi Gua\u00e7u River according with the flood pulse intensity during summer months (wet season) (C. S. Gon\u00e7alves personal observation). Their physical, chemical and structural features are presented in Table 1, which are quite similar to other oxbows of the upper Paran\u00e1 River floodplain (Agostinho and J\u00falio Junior, 1999). The Mogi Gua\u00e7u Reservoir (22\u00b0 21\u2019 S and 46\u00b0 51\u2019 W) is a run-of-the-river impoundment and was formed in 1994 by the damming of the Mogi Gua\u00e7u and Peixe rivers in order to supply the neighboring municipalities and generate 7.2 MW of electric power. The water residence time is 72h. The studied oxbows are located in the upper reach of Mogi\nGua\u00e7u River and 43 km downstream Mogi Gua\u00e7u Reservoir (Gon\u00e7alves and Braga, 2008).\nThe damming regulates the natural river flow, and thus the oxbow lakes may eventually suffer the effects of this control. Despite this, the oxbow lakes studied herein can still be influenced by the flood pulse of the Mogi Gua\u00e7u River during rainfall peak in the summer; only Barrinha was not affected by overflow during the study period (C. S. Gon\u00e7alves personal observation). The composition of fish assemblage of these oxbow lakes and reservoir was described by Gon\u00e7alves and Braga (2008); other characteristics of the studied area are presented in Table 1.\n2.2.\tSampling methods and data collection\nSamples were taken in oxbow and reservoir between August 2005 and July 2006 to cover the dry and the wet seasons, i.e., three samples in each season, and three samples in each environment, totaling twelve samples. Specimens were collected with four baited minnow traps (approximately 60 cm long and 20 cm wide, without meshes), using dog food as bait. The traps were set during the afternoon, near the marginal vegetation, and collected in the following morning after ~18h exposure (see Gon\u00e7alves and Braga, 2008 for detailed sampling procedure). Dry and wet periods in the study area was determined according to methodology proposed by Walter and Lieth (I960), using the average of 30 years of rainfall and air temperature, and data provided by the meteorological station (D4-100) located on the Campininha farm. The dry period corresponded from April to September, and the wet period from October to March.\nTable 1.

Voucher specimens are deposited in the fish collection of Departamento de Zoologia e Bot\u00e2nica, UNESP \u2014 S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto (DZSJRP 012378, DZSJRP 012384, DZSJRP 012385).\nIn the laboratory, we obtained the standard length (mm), total weight (g), and sex of each specimen. Gonadal maturation stages were defined macroscopically according to oocyte's appearance, color, vascularization and transparency of the gonads, in the following categories: A (immature), B (maturing), C (mature) and D (spent) (cf. Vazzoler, 1996). To assess fecundity, only mature ovaries characterized by the presence of vitellogenic oocytes, i.e., stage C, were removed from the visceral cavity, weighted and kept in Gilson's solution until complete detachment of oocytes from epithelium and ovarian follicles.\n2.3.\tData analyses\nTotal fecundity (calculated for both ovaries) was estimated using the volumetric method (Vazzoler, 1996). The total count of vitellogenic oocytes, i.e., perinucleolar oocytes were not considered, was performed under a stereomicroscope (40x magnification); 100 of these oocytes were randomly selected to be measured with an ocular micrometer (10x magnification). The spawning type (single or multiple) was determined according to the frequency distribution of oocytes by diameter classes. Single spawners are species that mature and spawn only one batch of oocytes per spawning season, and multiple spawners release its oocytes in more than one batch during the spawning season (Godinho et al., 2010).\nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by a posteriori Tukey test was used to compare the mean fecundity (log transformed) among Hyphessobrycon species. Simple linear regressions were used to verify the dependence of fecundity on total weight for each species, following the model: Ln (F) = a + b Ln (W) + e, were F is the fecundity estimated for the mature females, W is the total weight, e is the error (with normal distribution and constant variance), and a and b are the model parameters representing the intercept and the slope, respectively. The slope b was compared among the three species using an Analysis of Covariance model (ANCOVA) (Zar, 2010).\nThe average length between sexes for each species was compared using t-tests (Zar, 2010). The body condition was assessed to identify differences in\nthe relationship between length and weight of the three species. It was evaluated by ANCOVA models in order to determine whether the total weight (dependent variable) varied among species or sexes (factors) when controlling for the effect of standard length (covariate) (Cetra, 2005), according to the model: log (W, = p + S. + fl. (log L.. \u2014 log L) + s., where Wi is the total weight of the individual j in sex i (male or female), p is the population mean, S, is the effect of sex i, L,. is the standard length of\ni\tij\nindividual j in sex i, Li is the mean standard length of sex i and s,, is the random error associated to ij\nindividual j in sex i.\nSize at first sexual maturity was calculated by means of a logistic regression according to the a+bL\nmodel: MAT = - -\t, were MAT is the response\n1 + ea\nvariable (0 for immature and 1 for mature fishes), L is the standard length, and a and b parameters of the equation. After adjusting this equation for each species, the size at first sexual maturity (i.e. the length at which 50% of the fishes are expected to be mature) was calculated by substituting MAT by 0.5 and finding the corresponding L.\nAll statistical analyses were performed in R software, version 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2013), considering the significance level at 5%.\n3.\tResults\nA total of 552 specimens were collected (Table 2). Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus occurred only in oxbow lakes (112 specimens). Hyphessobrycon eques predominated in oxbow lakes (354 specimens) but was also captured in the reservoir (25 specimens), while H. anisitsi predominated in the reservoir (58 specimens) but also occurred in oxbow lakes (3 specimens).\nFecundity was estimated from the analysis of 32, 111 and 17 mature ovaries of H. bifasciatus, H. eques and H. anisitsi, respectively, and ranged from 151 to 1,017 (mean = 482 \u00b1 221sd), 137 to 848 (486 \u00b1 159), and 298 to 2,040 (931 \u00b1 521) oocytes for each species (Table 2). The distribution of oocytes diameters (Figure 1) showed only one batch of mature oocytes for H. bifasciatus and H. eques, which ranged from 216 to 360 pm and 600 to 768 pm, respectively, suggesting that they are single spawners. Hyphessobrycon anisitsi evidenced two batches; one composed by several small oocytes (between 144-432 pm) that are still under development, and another batch with larger oocytes (between 504-816 pm) in advanced stage of\nTable 2.

The opposite was recorded for H. eques and H. anisitsi: mature females predominated during the wet season (four mature females of H. eques occurred in the dry season and none for H. anisitsi). Mean fecundity was higher for H. anisitsi than for H. bifasciatus and H. eques (F2 = 12.97, p &lt;0.001) and increased with weight for H. eques and H. anisitsi (p &lt;0.001), but not for H. bifasciatus (p = 0.148) (Table 2, Figure 2) (ANCOVA: F .\t= 11.52, df .\t= 2,\ndf ., , = 157, p &lt;0.001).\nresidual\nHyphessobrycon anisitsi had the greatest length range and H. eques the lowest (Table 2). Females were on average larger than males in H. anisitsi (t = 3.70, df = 47, p = 0.001, n females = 30, n ma[es = 19) and H. eques (t = 3.32, df = 358, p = 0.001, n fl = 198, n l = 162), but not in H. bifasciatus (t = 0.33, df =90, p = 0.738, n , , = 50, n . = 42). The significant interaction females\tmales\nterm in the ANCOVA model indicated that the slope of length-weight relationship is not the same for all three species (F = 6.27, df = 2;\ninteraction\tinteraction\ndfresiduai = 489, p = 0.002). Linear regressions for each species showed a lower and similar relationship for H. bifasciatus (b = 2.85) and H. eques (b = 2.61) and a greater inclination for H. anisitsi (b = 3.27) (Table 2). There was no significant difference in the length-weight slope between sexes for H. bifasciatus (p = 0.273), H. eques (p = 0.316), or H. anisitsi (p = 0.904).\nThe size at first sexual maturity was similar for H. bifasciatus and H. eques (19.4 cm and 20.0 cm, respectively), while H. anisitsi attained the largest size (27.8 cm) (Figure 3).\n4.\tDiscussion\nAmong the life-history traits, fecundity, oocytes\u2019 size, the number of clutches, and the reproductive season possibly affects the reproductive success of a species in a particular environment (Matthews, 1998), and are expected to evolve as an adaptative responses to environmental pressures (Winemiller, 2005). The results obtained herein indicated that the two Hyphessobrycon species that predominated in the oxbow lakes (H. bifasciatus and H. eques) were single spawners (i.e. a single bout of reproduction per year) whereas H. anisitsi that predominated in the reservoir was a multiple spawner (i.e. repeated reproductive bouts per year). In seasonal environments, single spawners are synchronized with the floods to maximize the juvenile survivorship (Agostinho and J\u00falio Junior, 1999), while reservoirs harbors multiple spawners\u2019 fish due to the reduced fluctuation between high and low floods resulted from dam regulation (Petesse et al., 2007). Considering that river damming control the riverflow (Agostinho et al., 2008), the studied oxbow lakes herein may eventually suffer the effects of this control since they are located 43 km downstream reservoir. However, during the study period we observed that the oxbow lakes were influenced by overflow of Mogi Gua\u00e7u River all over the rainfall peak in the summer. Therefore, the seasonality of flood imposed to the oxbow lakes may favor single spawners as H. bifasciatus and H. eques, while the\nIn(Wt)\nFigure 2.

According to Agostinho and J\u00falio Junior (1999), several biological processes that occur in the floodplain of the upper Paran\u00e1 River are dependent on the flooding regime, as evidenced by the adjustment of the biological cycle of several species to river fluctuations. Fishes inhabiting seasonal environments are exposed to periodical fluctuations of environmental parameters of river-floodplain systems (Junk et al., 1989), which are supposed to represent the main selective pressures acting on the biological strategies of the aquatic organisms.\nFecundity, body size, body condition and size at sexual maturity varied among Hyphessobrycon species. The body size differences between sexes and the relationships between fecundity and body weight may be related to the reproductive strategy adopted by fish populations. For instance, the largest body size reached by H. eques and H. anisitsi females compared to males is a reproductive strategy related to sexual dimorphism (Agostinho and J\u00falio Junior, 1999). In fish, fecundity depends on the size of coelomic cavity to accommodate mature ovaries (which are bigger than immature ovaries), thus, larger females are more fecund (Wootton, 1992), as evidenced by fecundity-weight relationships to H. eques and H. anisitsi. For H. bifasciatus, body size was not different between males and females, and there was no relationship between female fecundity and body size.\nWe also verified that mean fecundity was higher for H. anisitsi but regression analyses revealed that this was a consequence of the larger body sizes attained by mature females. Conversely, when comparing the fecundity for individuals of the same weight, we verified that the reproductive effort (number of oocytes per gram) for H. bifasciatus and H. eques was higher than H. anisitsi. The larger size of sexual maturity estimated for H. anisitsi is in accordance with their higher fecundity and, in opposition, the smaller size of sexual maturity estimated for H. bifasciatus and H. eques agrees with their smaller fecundity. Hence, we suggest that the higher reproductive effort of H. bifasciatus and H. eques is also a response to the flood seasonality in the oxbow lakes that limit the extension of favorable conditions for reproduction.\nEnvironmental conditions may either impose constraints on certain life-history traits or increase the fitness of a species, depending on how their feeding and reproductive habits interact to determine\nits persistence and abundance (Matthews, 1998). According to Godinho et al. (2010), lentic habitats allow a greater diversity of reproductive styles to fishes than lotic environments. Furthermore, fishes inhabiting similar habitats may have different lifehistory traits, and even closely related species can exhibit different life-history patterns (Wootton, 1992). The life-history traits analyzed in the present study were essential to the comprehension of how species are favored in environments they inhabit depending on their reproductive strategies. Similar responses in those traits may be common to other characid fishes inhabiting similar environments.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Dr. Francisco Langeani for fish identification, Campininha's staff support, IBAMA (02027.000991/2005-71) and COTEC (42.042/2005) for licenses, Dr. Mauricio Cetra for helpful comments, CAPES to the graduate scholarship given to the senior author, and Dr. Fernando Pelicice for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.\nReferences\nAGOSTINHO AA., MIRANDA, LE., BINI, LM., GOMES, LC., THOMAZ, SM. and SUZUKI, HI. 1999.
