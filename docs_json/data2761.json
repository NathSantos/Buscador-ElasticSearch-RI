However, little paleontological data is available from this formation, preventing accurate biostratigraphic and paleoecological interpretations. An abundant, diversified and well preserved assemblage of palynomorphs was recognized from sampling conducted in an outcrop section in Cipol\u00e2ndia District of Aquidauana Municipality, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. A total of 35 indigenous palynomorph taxa was recognized, comprising 6 species of spores (related to 5 genera), 28 species of pollen grains (14 genera) and 1 species of chlorophycean algae. Monosaccate pollen grains are exceptionally dominant, representing 90.38% of the association, particularly constituted by species of the genera Cannanoropollis (30.41% of the total assemblage), Potonieisporites (28.14%) and Plicatipollenites (19.52%). This quantitative overrepresentation is not usual from Gondwana deposits, revealing a particular plant dominance of Cordaitales in the terrestrial flora. These results are interpreted as an upland ecology characterized by plants with a moisture-independent reproduction strategy, under a glacial climate influence. Certain species of pollen allow assignment of this assemblage to the Crucisaccites monoletus Zone (Late Pennsylvanian), which had been recognized only in the middle portion of the Itarar\u00e9 Group at the northeastern margin of the basin.\nKey words: biostratigraphy, paleoecology, palynology, Pennsylvanian.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe northwestern margin of the Paran\u00e1 Basin exhibits a thick section of sedimentary outcrops, related to the Furnas, Ponta Grossa (both of Devonian age) and the Aquidauana (Permo-Carboniferous) formations. The Aquidauana Formation is mainly composed of sandstones and diamictites, and it is laterally\nCorrespondence to: Paulo Alves de Souza\nE-mail: paulo.alves.souza@ufrgs.br\ncorrelated with the Itarar\u00e9 Group (Fran\u00e7a and Potter 1988, Milani et al. 2007). This unit, as well as the Itarar\u00e9 Group and correlated units in South America and Africa are representatives of the Upper Paleozoic glacial event in the Western Gondwana. Fossils of different nature are well known from these glaciogenic units, such as those from the Itarar\u00e9 Group, comprising plant remains, palynomorphs, vertebrates and invertebrates, allowing significant\nbiostratigraphic and paleoecological contributions (see summary in Holz et al. 2010). However, paleontological records from the Aquidauana Formation are very scarce and when present, they describe sporadic isolated few fossil specimens.\nThe fossil content ofthe Aquidauana Formation in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul comprises one record of an ichnofossil (invertebrate traces), records of fish scales (Paleoniscids), one fragment of insect wing, indeterminate plant remains (see synthesis in Scheffler et al. 2010), and limited palynomorphs (Daemon and Quadros 1970). These scarce, low variety and sparse occurrences prevent adequate age attributions as well as limiting paleoenvironmental reconstructions.\nPalynomorphs listed from the Aquidauana Formation concern few specimens of pollen grains, some of them with open nomenclature (Daemon and Quadros 1970). This palynological content is relatively poor when compared with associations derived from the northeastern and south portions of the basin, preventing accurate correlations.\nEfforts have been made recently, attempting new palynological studies from outcrop samples of the Aquidauana Formation. However, samples are generally barren of palynomorphs, with only semidestroyed phytoclasts and amorphous organic matter recorded. These limitations are attributed to the lithological nature of the outcrops, with sediments primarily comprised of red to yellow sandstones and diamictites with high degree of weathering, indicating deposition in oxidizing conditions (see Milani et al. 2007), where palynomorphs are generally destroyed by oxidation.\nThis paper presents new palynological records from the Aquidauana Formation derived from an outcrop section located at Cipolandia, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, from an expressive and unusual layer of shale, once this lithology is rare or absent in the Aquidauana Formation. These data were preliminarily presented by Souza et al. (2013), who registered several species of spores and\npollen grains, which amplify the paleontological content to this unit, with biostratigraphical and paleoenvironmental significance.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe outcrop section studied comprises ca. 50 m of sediment, exposed on the state road MS-447, approximately 12 km from the east/northeast of the Cipolandia District, in the municipality of Aquidauana, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Fig. 1). The sampled section (Fig. 2a) is comprised, in ascending stratigraphic order, of a massive diamictite (Fig. 2b), with faceted and striated polymitic pebbles, cobbles and boulders, of variable dimensions (decametric to metric), chaotically distributed within a silty-sandy matrix. This diamictite is stratigraphicaly followed by a sandstone package (Fig. 2c and d), of varied granulometry, exhibiting planar and trough cross-stratification (in sets sometimes separated by marked surfaces of pebbles and cobbles), with rare matrix and dispersed pebbles. A thin layer of dark grey to greenish shale occurs in the upper portion of the section (Fig. 2e), with varying degrees of weathering, and rare dropstones.\nThree samples (AQ-84, 86 and 87, see figs. 1c and 2a) were processed according to the standard palynological technique for Paleozoic materials (Quadros and Melo 1987), which comprises the removal of carbonates and silicates by using hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. Palynomorphs within the 10-250 pm size range were concentrated in the final organic residues, from which glass slides were mounted with polyester resins. Taxonomic identifications and photomicrographs were made under a standard optical microscope. The slides are housed at the Paleontological Museum of the Rio Grande do Sul Federal University (UFRGS), under codes MP-P (AQ-84: MP-P 8920, 10259; AQ-86: 8921; AQ-87: 8919, 10257, 10258). All palynomorphs recorded from the AQ-87 outcrop (geographic coordinates 678,346 E and 7,773,846 N) were considered in the quantitative analysis,\nAquidauana\nParan\u00e1\nParan\u00e1 Basin\nCampo Grande\nBRAZIL\n<\u2014(.Brasili.\nAQ-87\nAQ-84\nCIPOL\u00c2NDIA\n668 E\n670\n672\n674\n678\nGoi\u00e1s\nPARAGUAY\nRoad\n670\n672\nSao Paulo\n674\n676\n678\nLegend\n\u2022 Outcrops\n0\t0.5\t1 km\nBorehole location\n2-TQ-1-MT\nFigure 1 - Location of study area.

The other samples presented limited palynomorphs, with poor preservation, dominated by degraded phytoclasts and amorphous organic matter.\nThe AQ-87 assemblage is composed of diverse, well preserved and abundant palynomorphs, comprising 35 species of indigenous taxa, related to 6 species of spores (related to 5 genera), 28 species of pollen grains (14 genera) and 1 species of chlorophycean algae, as listed in table I.\nFurthermore, reworked species of spores, acritarchs and prasinophycean algae were also registered. Photomicrographs of selected species are presented in figures 3 and 4.\nPalynomorphs from AQ-87 outcrop are very well preserved, rarely showing fragmentation or corrosion. Phytoclasts are subordinate, comprising opaque and non-opaque (brown to dark yellow) types, including fragments of cuticles and tracheids, generally with angular sides, elongated to equidimensional in shape. Interestingly and exceptionally, three specimens of indigenous pollen grains, present evidence of shearing, containing breaking but with no complete fragmentation of the grain. This is a type of taphonomic damage compared to those in Devonian palynomorphs described by Arai and Melo (2003).\n50 m \u25a0\n\u2014 AQ-87\nAQ-86\nO O O O\n\u25a1\nA\n\u25a1\nA\nA\n\u25a1\nA\n\u25a1\n-AQ-84\nA\nA\n\u25a1\n0 m\nLegend\nGray shale\nSandstone with cross-stratification\nA \u25a1\nDiamictite\no o o\nPebbles\n\u2014AQ-84 Palynological sampling\n1 thin to coarse sand\n\u25a1 r\nX\u2019\nV\nFigure 2 - Outcrops and general stratigraphy.

In comparison with the coeval palynomorphs, no difference was observed in their preservation (color or fragmentation degree).\nDISCUSSION\nBiostratigraphy\nThe palynostratigraphic proposal of Daemon and Quadros (1970) is the only available zonation that encompasses the Aquidauana Formation in the north and northwestern portion of the basin (Fig. 5).

These intervals were mainly recorded from core samples of the 2-TL-1-MT borehole (Tr\u00eas Lagoas). Palynomorphs were also recorded by those authors from the 2-TQ-1-MT boherole (Taquari) and the A284 outcrop (\u201cCol\u00f4nia Merure\u201d), but assemblages are scarcer and lack diversity and are less accurate for biostratigraphy. The approximate location of these last boreholes is indicated in Fig. 1b; location of the A284 outcrop is not available from the original paper of Daemon and Quadros (1970).\nTaking into account the assemblage recorded here, a general correlation could be made with the subsurface cores T19 to T21 of the 2-TL-1-MT, where the intervals G-H3 were recognized. A correlation with a younger interval is unable due the presence of Stellapollenites talchirensis (originally designated as \u201cP393\u201d by Daemon and Quadros 1970) and Protohaploxypinus goraiensis (designated as Protohaplypinus sp. \u201cP391\u201d) from the samples of this borehole. Both species are absent in the\nAQ-87 assemblage and they are, according to new palynostratigraphic interpretations presented here, guide species for higher stratigraphic levels within the correlated Itarar\u00e9 Group, as discussed below.\nAccording to Souza and Marques-Toigo (2005) and Souza (2006), four interval zones based on spore-pollen taxa are distributed through the Gondwana I Supersequence of the Paran\u00e1 Basin (see Fig. 5): Ahrensisporites cristatus (AcZ), Crucisaccites monoletus (CmZ), Vittatina costabilis (VcZ) and Lueckisporites virkkiae (LvZ). The AcZ and CmZ are Pennsylvanian in age (equivalent to the G-H2 intervals of Daemon and Quadros 1970), whilst VcZ and LvZ (equivalent to the H3-L3 intervals) are Cisuralian to early Guadalupian in age (Early to Middle Permian), according to Holz et al. (2010) and Mori et al. (2011). The Pennsylvanian zones of Souza (2006) are yet to be found outside the area where they were erected, stratigraphically corresponding to the basal to middle deposits of the Itarar\u00e9 Group, in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1.\nIn general, both AcZ and CmZ as well as the intervals G-H3 present palynological assemblages dominated by spores and monosaccate pollen grains. Among the latter, radiometric and bilateral taxa are more common, mainly represented by species of Plicatipollenites, Cannanoropollis and Potonieisporites, as verified in the AQ-87 assemblage of the Aquidauana Formation.\nCertain guide palynomorph from the zonation of Souza (2006) were recorded from the AQ-87 sample assemblage, allowing biostratigraphic calibration. Among them, Crucisaccites monoletus and Scheuringipollenites maximus are the only pollen species stratigraphically restricted to the CmZ, confirming this biozone attribution. This biostratigraphic assignment represents a more detailed refinement in comparison to the intervals of Daemon and Quadros (1970), whereby the association of the AQ-87 would correspond to the G-H intervals, with ages between the Late Pennsylvanian to the Early Permian.\nFigure 3 - Photomicrographs of selected palynomorphs.

For the most part, these specimens are well preserved with no evidence of damage during reworking, such as color differentiation or fragmentation. These features are very common from the basal and middle portions of the Itarar\u00e9 Group (see Souza and Petri 1998, Souza 2006), where AcZ and CmZ are present.\nPaleoecology and Palaeoenvironment\nSpores and monosaccate pollen grains are dominant within the palynological assemblages from Pennsylvanian to early Permian Gondwanan deposits. This pattern of representation is interpreted as a general tendency for spore-pollen distribution across Gondwana (Venkatachala et al. 1995, Felix et al. 2007, Stephenson 2008).

In these cases, radiosymetric and bilateral monosaccate pollen mostly belonging to the genera Cannanoropollis, Plicatipollenites and Potonieisporites are well represented in terms of abundance and/or diversity.\nIn the Brazilian area of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, dominance of monosaccate pollen grains over spores was presented from distinct deposits of the glaciogenic Itarar\u00e9 Group, in different stratigraphical levels, concerning its basal (Souza et al. 2003), middle\n(Di Pasquo et al. 2003) and upper (Gandini et al. 2007) portions. Although absolute frequencies were not always stated by those authors, none of these records from the Paran\u00e1 Basin exhibit such dominance by this group of pollen grains, as observed herein.\nPollen related to Plicatipollenites, Cannanoropollis and Potonieisporites were derived from a primitive, monosaccate-producing gimnosperm (Balme 1995), related to Late Paleozoic arboreal plants (probably Cordaitales) characterized by a moisture-independent reproduction strategy, representing an upland flora (Stephenson and Osterloff 2002). Cordaitales are an extinct group of Gymnosperm, of widespread distribution within Pennsylvanian to Permian deposits, variable in habit (mainly arboreal) and ecological requirements. These plant remains have also been reported from\ndeposits of poorly drained soils (Wagner 2001). Although macrofloristic remains of this taxon are more frequent in swamp environments, as a coalforming component, palynological associations are generally dominated by spore-producing taxon, mainly lycopsids and subordinately sphenopsids and filicopsids as demonstrated by Cazzulo-Klepzig et al. (2005) and Boardman et al. (2012) from Permian coals of the Paran\u00e1 Basin.\nThus the higher frequency of these monosaccate three genera in the AQ-87 Aquidauana association is unusual in palynological records from Pennsylvanian to Permian Gondwana strata. This evidence can be explained, according to Stephenson and Osterloff (2002), by a monosaccate-producing upland ecology and a lowland fern ecology in Gondwana, being influenced by a cold climate during the Permo-Carboniferous. According to those authors, the monosaccate-producing flora was present in upland areas during occupation of floodplains by the cold climate fern community; lacustrine flooding resulting from minor deglaciation events could prevent the persistence of lowland spore-producing plants and, consequently, the increase in representation of the upland flora. Spores and bisaccate pollen grains are very scarce, both representing less than 8% of the total assemblage (see table II). Bisaccate pollen grains are more abundant in Gondwana basins from deposits overlying glaciogenic units, as a result of climate amelioration, representing a changeover of the upland ecology.\nThis scenario is also supported by the lithofa-ciological analysis. The section is interpreted as representing a fining upward cycle, as result of a decrease energy, characterizing an event in the front of glacial retreat and subsequent flooding. Although rare, dispersed dropstones within the shale, indicates glacial influence. The continental nature of the sedimentation is confirmed by the presence of Botryococcus, a chlorophycean algae typical of freshwater (Batten and Grenfell 1996). No marine sedimentary or palynological evidence was recorded.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis paper examines a well preserved assemblage of palynomorph, comprised by taxa of spores, pollen grains and chlorophycean algae which contribute new ideas concerning the relative age and paleoecology of the Aquidauana Formation, northwestern Paran\u00e1 Basin. Predominance of oxidized sandstones, conglomerates and diamictites harms preservation of palynomorphs, which become very rare in the Aquidauana Formation; here we sampled a productive shale layer, which is an uncommon lithology in this unit.\nThe presence of Crucisaccites monoletus and Scheuringipollenites maximus allowed correlation with the Crucisaccites monoletus interval Zone (CmZ) previously established in the northeastern area of the basin. It implies a late Late Pennsylvanian age and a biostratigraphical correlation of the studied section of the Aquidauana Formation with the middle portion of the Itarar\u00e9 Group, both glaciogenic in origin. It is the first recognition of this Pennsylvanian interval zone outside the area it was erected (states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1), demonstrating a wider area of continuous deposition. However, the age span of Aquidauana Formation reaches the Early Permian, when taking into account previous subsurface data with typical guide species of the Vittatina costabilis Zone.\nAn unusually dominant monosaccate pollen grain representation (90.38%) was recorded from the Aquidauana association, particularly Cordaitales pollen types, such as Cannanoropollis, Plicatipollenites and Potonieisporites, which represent up to ca. 78% of the total assemblage. Considering other similar records throughout Gondwanan basins, a relationship with glaciogenic deposits of Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian ages is inferred. The paleoecological significance of these data suggests predominance of an upland ecology characterized by plants with a moistureindependent reproduction strategy. A continental\ninterpretation is indicated by palynological and sedimentological evidence, characterizing deposition in the front of retreating glacier, with consequent flooding of the lowland areas. Palynological association is derived almost exclusively from upland surrounding areas, where a Cordaitales flora was dominant.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAuthors would like to thank to Adam D.

Entretanto, poucos dados palinol\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis para esta forma\u00e7\u00e3o, limitando interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es bioestratigr\u00e1ficas e paleoecol\u00f3gicas acuradas. Uma abundante, diversificada e bem preservada assembleia de palinomorfos foi registrada a partir de uma amostragem de uma se\u00e7\u00e3o aflorante realizada no Distrito de Cipol\u00e2ndia, cidade de Aquidauana, Estado do Mato Grosso do Sul, Brasil. Um total de 35 t\u00e1xons de palinomorfos ind\u00edgenas foi reconhecido, compreendendo seis esp\u00e9cies de esporos (relacionados a cinco g\u00eaneros), 28 esp\u00e9cies de gr\u00e3os de p\u00f3len (14 g\u00eaneros) e 1 esp\u00e9cie de alga clorof\u00edcea. Gr\u00e3os de p\u00f3len monossacados s\u00e3o excepcionalmente dominantes, representando 90,38% da associa\u00e7\u00e3o, particularmente constitu\u00eddos por esp\u00e9cies dos g\u00eaneros Cannanoropollis (30.41% do total da assembleia), Potonieisporites (28,14%) e Plicatipollenites (19,52%). Esta super\nrepresentatividade quantitativa n\u00e3o \u00e9 usual em dep\u00f3sitos do Gondwana, revelando uma domin\u00e2ncia especial das Cordaitales no na flora terrestre. Estes resultados s\u00e3o interpretados como resultante de condi\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas caracterizadas por plantas que ocupavam terras altas, com independ\u00eancia de umidade na estrat\u00e9gia de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, sob influ\u00eancia clim\u00e1tica glacial. Certas esp\u00e9cies de gr\u00e3os de p\u00f3len permitem posicionamento na Zona Crucisaccites monoletus (Pennsilvaniano tardio), a qual tem sido reconhecida somente na por\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia do Grupo Itarar\u00e9 na margem nordeste da bacia.\nPalavras-chave: bioestratigrafia, paleoecologia, palino-logia, Pennsilvaniano.\nREFERENCES\nArai M AND Melo JHG. 2003.
