Fine mesh bags (0.5 mm) containing native alder leaves from tropical (Alnus \n\nacuminata Kunth) and temperate (Alnus incana (L.) Moench) zones were incubated in five \n\nlocations along the altitudinal gradient at each latitude and retrieved at selected sampling \n\ndates to decomposition rates and diversity of decomposers.  \n\nDecomposition rates (k) were faster in Colorado (0.0197 - 0.0453 range) than in \n\nEcuador (0.0065 - 0.014 range). In Ecuador litter decomposition decreased with elevation \n\n(linear regression, p &lt;0.001; R\n2 \n\n= 0.95), which was explained by temperature difference \n\nacross sites. In Colorado litter decomposition did not change with altitude (linear \n\nregression, p = 0.48; R\n2 \n\n&lt;0.001) and was not related to any of the measured environmental \n\nparameters. Nitrates in Colorado were ~30 fold higher than in Ecuador (11.28 vs. 0.40 \n\n\u00b5g/L; t-test, p = 0.04) and might be overridden the temperature effect.  \n\nMicrobial decomposers diversity was estimated applying the denaturing gradient gel \n\nelectrophoresis (DGGE) technique and assessing the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for aquatic \n\nfungi (ITS2 region) and bacteria (V3 variable region). Aquatic fungi diversity in Ecuador \n\nincreased with elevation (linear regression, p = 0.03; R\n2 \n\n= 0.83), whereas in Colorado the \n\nmaximum number of taxa peaked at middle altitudes (polynomial regression; p = 0.7; R\n2 \n\n= \n\n0.57). The three PCA axis in Ecuador explained 93% of the total variability and the number \n\nof fungal OTUs related with PO4. In Colorado, the three PCA axis explained 92% of the \n\ntotal variability and taxa richness was related with CPOM standing stock, shallow waters \n\nand moderate concentrations of NO3. The number of fungal taxa recorded in Ecuador and \n\nColorado (13.3 and 15.2 OTUs) was not statistically different (t-test; p = 0.2; t =1.43;         \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\ndf  = 8). The MDS analysis using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient determined that fungi \n\ntaxa is biogeographically distributed by latitude.  \n\nBacteria taxa units in Ecuador and Colorado decreased with altitude (linear \n\nregression; p = 0.0001; R\n2 \n\n= 0.58 and p = 0.0004; R\n2 \n\n= 0.99). The higher number of OTUs \n\nalong the Ecuadorian gradient was primarily correlated with the 2\nnd\n\n PCA axis, which in turn \n\nwas correlated with CPOM standing stock, NO3 and NO2. In Colorado the taxa variability \n\nwas negatively correlated with the first PCA axis, which was mainly correlated with \n\ntemperature and NO3 concentrations. Bacteria community exhibited a cosmopolitan \n\ndistribution (MDS; stress value: 0.19).  \n\nThe dissimilarity among communities along the altitudinal gradients (? diversity) \n\nwas lower in Ecuador than in Colorado for aquatic fungi (ANOSIM, p = 0.51; Global R= \n\n0.004 vs. p = 0.003; Global R= 0.54) and bacteria (ANOSIM, p = 0.54; Global R= -0.021 \n\nvs. p = 0.003; Global R= 0.51). \n\nThese results suggest that (1) litter decomposition is a temperature dependent \n\nprocess, which can be overridden by other factors such as nutrients in the water. (2) Species \n\nrichness and the community composition of microbial decomposers may be controlled by \n\nlocal environmental variables, such as dissolved nutrients in water and substrate \n\ncharacteristics (leaf quality), which may imply that broadly patterns observed on large \n\norganisms might not affect small size organisms. Besides, latitudinal species richness \n\ntendency might be barely observed along an altitudinal gradient, considering the \n\ntemperature as the mainly environmental factor driving the diversity and the taxa turnover.  \n\n \n\nKey words: microbial decomposition, temperature, latitude, altitude, OTUs. \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana de folhas senescentes em rios e a riqueza em taxa \n\nde fungos e bact\u00e9rias aqu\u00e1ticas foram estudados ao longo de um gradiente de altitude em dois \n\nsistemas, 1600-3800 m snm no Equador (ecossistema tropical a 0 \u00b0 Lat) e 1992-3200 m snm em \n\nColorado EUA (ecossistema temperado a 40 \u00b0 N). Sacos de malha fina (0,5 mm) contendo \n\nfolhas de amieiro nativo em cada una das zonas (Equador: Alnus acuminata Kunth; Colorado: \n\nAlnus incana (L.) Moench) foram incubadas em cinco locais ao longo do gradiente de altitude \n\nem cada latitude e recuperados em datas de amostragem selecionados para determinar as taxas \n\nde decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a diversidade de decompositores. \n\nAs taxas de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o (k) foram mais r\u00e1pidos em Colorado (0,0197-0,0453 gama de \n\nvalores) do que no Equador (0,0065 - 0.014). No Equador a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o diminuiu com a \n\neleva\u00e7\u00e3o (regress\u00e3o linear, p&lt;0,001; R\n2\n = 0.95), o que foi explicado pela diferen\u00e7a de \n\ntemperatura entre locais. Em Colorado a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o mudo com a altitude (regress\u00e3o \n\nlinear, p = 0,48; R\n2\n&lt;0,001) e n\u00e3o esteve ligada a nenhum dos par\u00e2metros ambientais \n\nregistrados. Os nitratos no Colorado foram ~ 30 vezes mais elevada do que no Equador (11,28 \n\nvs 0,40 mg / L; t-test, p = 0.04) podendo o seu efeito sobrepor-se ao da temperatura. \n\nA diversidad de microrganismos decompositores foi estimada aplicando a eletroforese \n\nem gel com gradiente desnaturante (DGGE), avaliando o DNA ribossomal (rDNA) para fungos \n\naqu\u00e1tico (regi\u00e3o ITS2) e bact\u00e9rias (V3 regi\u00e3o vari\u00e1vel). A diversidade de fungos aqu\u00e1ticos no \n\nEquador aumentou com a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (regress\u00e3o linear, p = 0.03; R\n2\n = 0.83), enquanto no \n\nColorado o n\u00famero m\u00e1ximo de taxa atingiu um pico em altitudes m\u00e9dias (regress\u00e3o polinomial; \n\np = 0.7; R\n2\n = 0.57). Os tr\u00eas primeiros eixos de uma \u201can\u00e1lise de componentes principais\u201d (PCA) \n\nno Equador explicaram 93% da variabilidade total e o n\u00famero de OTUs em fungos esteve \n\nrelacionada com PO4, que foi maior nos locais mais altos e desceu para os locais mais baixos. \n\nNo Colorado, os tr\u00eas eixos da PCA explicaram 92% da variabilidade total e a riqueza de taxa \n\nfoi relacionada com CPOM, baixa profundidade da \u00e1gua e concentra\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas de NO3. O \n\nn\u00famero de taxa para fungos registrados no Equador e no Colorado (13.3 e 15.2 OTUs) n\u00e3o foi \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nestatisticamente diferente (teste t; p = 0.2; t = 1.43; df = 8). A an\u00e1lise MDS usando o coeficiente \n\nde similaridade de Bray-Curtis mostrou que a identidade dos OTUs em Colorado e Equador foi \n\ndiferente. \n\nAs unidades taxon\u00f3micas das bact\u00e9rias no Equador e Colorado diminuiu com a altitude \n\n(regress\u00e3o linear; p = 0,0001; R\n2\n = 0.58 e p = 0.0004; R\n\n2\n = 0.99, respetivamente). O maior \n\nn\u00famero de OTUs ao longo do gradiente equatoriana foi correlacionado principalmente com o \n\nsegundo eixo do PCA, que por sua vez se correlaciona com CPOM, NO3 e NO2. Em Colorado a \n\nvariabilidade dos taxa foi negativamente correlacionada com o primeiro eixo do PCA, o qual foi \n\ncorrelacionado principalmente com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura e NO3. A comunidade das \n\nbact\u00e9rias exibiu uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o cosmopolita, i.e., n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7as na identidade entre \n\nEquador e Colorado (MDS; stress value: 0.19). \n\nA dissimilaridade entre as comunidades ao longo dos gradientes de altitude (? \n\ndiversidade) foi menor no Equador do que em Colorado para fungos aqu\u00e1ticos (ANOSIM,        \n\np = 0.51; global R = 0.004 vs p = 0.003; global R = 0.54) e bact\u00e9rias (ANOSIM, p = 0.54;         \n\nR = -0.021 global vs. p = 0.003; global R = 0.51). \n\nEstes resultados sugerem que (1) A taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo dependente da \n\ntemperatura, mas que pode ser mascarada por outros fatores, tais como nutrientes na \u00e1gua. (2) A \n\nriqueza de esp\u00e9cies e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade de microrganismos decompositores pode ser \n\ncontrolada por vari\u00e1veis ambientais locais, como os nutrientes dissolvidos na \u00e1gua e \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas de substrato (qualidade das folhas), o que sugere que os padr\u00f5es observados em \n\norganismos de grandes dimens\u00f5es pode n\u00e3o afetar aos organismos de menor tamanho. Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, a riqueza latitudinal de esp\u00e9cies pode ser dificilmente observada ao longo de um \n\ngradiente de altitude, caso a temperatura seja o principal fator ambiental que controla a \n\ndiversidade e o turnover de esp\u00e9cies, uma vez que as altera\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9rmicas na \u00e1gua s\u00e3o menores \n\ndo que for a dela. \n\nPalabras-chave: decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana, temperature, latitude, altitude, OTUs.  \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\nINDEX \n\n1.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.1 Latitudinal Patterns in Ecology  \n\nOne of the most recognizable ecological patterns on the earth is the variation in \n\nspecies composition and diversity among geographic locations (Willig et al. 2003; \n\nHawkins and Felizola 2004). These patterns, depending on the scale, are mostly controlled \n\nby geographic isolation, evolutionary history, global and local climate and species \n\ninteractions (Willig et al. 2003).  \n\nVon Humboldt described higher diversity patterns at tropical latitudes and a gradual \n\ndecrease towards to the poles. Subsequently, numerous examples in a wide range of taxa \n\nhave been documented (Rosenzwig 1992; Rex et al. 2005; Willig 2003). For instance, in \n\nNorth America higher diversity of butterflies occurs at lower latitudes (Kocher and \n\nWilliams 2000) and on a global scale this gradient is corroborated in gastropods, \n\nfreshwater and marine fishes, amphibians, certain migrant and non-migrant birds, bats and \n\nmany other mammals, as well as with plants in terrestrial ecosystems (Gaston 2000; Willig \n\net al. 2003; Rex et al. 2005). However, there are exceptions to the latitude-richness trend.  \n\nFor instance, aquatic macrophytes are more diverse in the median - higher latitudes  and \n\nparasite richness is not directly related with latitude (Willig et al. 2003).  \n\nSeveral explanations have been proposed to explain the taxa richness \u2013 latitude \n\nrelationship. One of the explanations is the species-area relationship, which states that \n\nlarger areas house larger number of species because of larger populations sizes and lower \n\nextinction rates (MacArthur and Wilson 1963). The terrestrial and ocean areas in the \n\ntropics have larger areas that higher latitudes and therefore most likely to harbor a larger \n\nnumber of taxa (Rex et al. 2005; Brown 2014). Another theory relates species richness \n\nwith primary production (Waide et al. 1999; Brown 2014) because allows large \n\npopulations and narrower niches (Waide et al. 1999; Mittelback et al. 2001; Schmid \n\n2002). Other theories relate taxa richness with climatic stability (Hawkins and Felizola \n\n2004; Brown 2014), the diversification time and biotic factors such as competition and \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\npredation (Pianka 1966; Molles 2010). Nevertheless, the species richness distribution can \n\nbe the consequences of several non-exclusive factors.  \n\nThe mean and annual temperature variations differ along the latitudinal gradient. In \n\nthe tropics, temperature tends to be more stable along the year compared with the higher \n\nlatitudes where larger annual seasonality is recorded. Hence, tropical species are \n\nevolutionary adapted to experience narrow changes of temperature and as a consequence, \n\nthese organisms might show limited dispersion ability (Janzen 1967). Thereby, \n\ntemperature regimes would be determining the distribution of species because of their \n\nthermal tolerance ranges.  \n\n \n\n1.2 Altitudinal patterns of species richness \n\nSince the temperature decreases with the latitude and with the elevation, is it could \n\nbe expected that the altitudinal gradient would mirror the latitudinal pattern in biological \n\nstructural and functional parameters. On the other hand, if species dispersion depends of \n\nphysiological constrains (narrower thermal niche) more than geographical barriers \n\n(mountains) as Janzen proposed (1967) and temperature fluctuation in altitude do not  \n\nmirror temperature fluctuations in latitude, at lower latitudes I expect a higher species \n\nreplacement across  altitudinal gradients than at higher latitudes (see Chapter II). \n\nFurthermore, according to the Island Biogeography theory developed by MacArthur and \n\nWilson (1963) that predict that higher number of species are likely to inhabit in larger \n\nspatial areas;  as the elevation increases, the surface area becomes narrow (K\u00f6rner 2007) \n\nand as a consequence, the lower altitudes would support higher diversity than higher \n\naltitudes. \n\nAs expected, species riches in hummingbirds in the Andean mountains in South \n\nAmerica and wild bees in the German Alps decrease with altitude (Graham et al. 2009; \n\nHoiss et al. 2012). Nonetheless, other taxonomic groups like leaf litter ants in the Western \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nUSA and non-endemic birds in the Hendgduam Mountains at East Asia, display a hump \n\nshaped curve, a peak of diversity in middle elevations (Sanders 2002; Wu et al. 2013). \n\n \n\n1.3 Stream ecosystem processes at different latitudes and elevations \n\n \n\nAs the diversity increases from the poles toward to the equatorial line and from \n\nhigh to lower altitudes, it is plausible that temperature (and other related factors) would be \n\npivotal variables controlling key ecosystem processes; thus biological rates might be \n\nhigher near to the tropics and at lower altitudes, as predicts the metabolic theory of \n\necology (MTE; Brown et al. 2004). The transformation (uptake and allocation) from food \n\nresources into energy by organisms is catalyzed by enzymatic activities, which obeys to \n\nthe physic laws. Thus, the rate of the reactions would depend of the kinetic energy \n\navailable in the environment, meaning that higher temperatures will accelerate the \n\nmetabolic rates, as is explained by the Boltzmann factor (e\n-E/kT\n\n) (Brown et al. 2004). \n\nFreshwater lotic systems, receive at least 2 billon tons of terrestrial organic and \n\ninorganic carbon inputs each year. This material is transported by streams, rivers and \n\ngroundwater fluxes to the sea (Cole et al. 2007) or processed (decomposed, incorporated \n\ninto living mass) in situ. In forested low order streams, allochthonous organic matter make \n\nup around 41-98% of energy incorporated into the aquatic food web by many \n\nmicroorganisms and macroinvertebrates (Fisher and Likens 1973; Abelho 2005). Once \n\nthat the leaves enter into streams, their soluble compounds are released into the water \n\n(leaching), they are colonized by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, consumed by \n\nmacroinvertebrate shredders and fragmented by physical abrasion (Hieber and Gessner \n\n2002). High water temperatures (Suberkropp and Chauvet 1995; Fernandes et al. 2009; \n\nGeraldes et al. 2012) dissolved nutrients in streams (Gulis and Suberkropp 2003; Ferreira \n\net al. 2006; Ferreira and Chauvet 2011a) and flow (Ferreira and Gra\u00e7a 2006; dos Santos \n\nFonseca et al. 2013), enhance litter decomposition rates. In addition, intrinsic leaf features \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nthat encompasses chemical and physical characteristics, such as toughness and defense \n\ncompounds also control the rates of litter decomposition (Ferreira and Chauvet 2011b; \n\nRezende et al. 2014).  \n\n \n\n1.4 Microbial communities as key players of organic matter processing \n \n\nStudies carried out in temperate streams have determined the major decomposer of \n\nleaf litter is a group of microorganisms identified as aquatic hyphomycetes, which \n\nmacerate the organic substrate and improve its palatability for other consumers, \n\nparticularly macroinvertebrates (Maharning and Barlocher 1996; Gra\u00e7a and Canhoto \n\n2006; B\u00e4rlocher 2010; Ferreira and Chauvet 2011b).  Environmental variables such as pH, \n\noxygen saturation, nutrient availability in the water and particularly the temperature, play \n\na pivotal role determining rates of microbial activities and shaping species assemblages, \n\nspecifically regarding aquatic hyphomycetes (Dangles et al. 2004; Medeiros et al. 2009; \n\nDuarte et al. 2013; Mart\u00ednez et al. 2014). \n\nMicrocosms assays revealed that several fungi species differ in their optimal \n\ntemperature for growth and sporulation, displaying optimal performance within variables \n\nranges of temperature depending of their origin (Duarte et al. 2006; Geraldes et al. 2012; \n\nFerreira et al. 2014). If temperature affects biological performance of aquatic fungi, it also \n\nhas the capability to affect ecological functions such as litter decomposition. In fact, this \n\nassumption has been corroborated by some authors who report a positive relationship \n\nbetween higher loss mass rate and fungal biomass (Maharning and Barlocher 1996; \n\nFerreira et al. 2012).  \n\nThere is a succession in fungal communities through the decomposition, in which \n\ntaxa specialized in lignin and cellulose are more frequent at the end of the process due to \n\nthe rapid loss of easily digested compounds at the beginning of the process (Dodds 2002; \n\nRoyer and Minshall 2003). In more advanced stages of decomposition, bacteria start \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nreplacing fungi as the main decomposers of small particles of organic matter (Gessner \n\n1997). Laboratory experiments have determined that temperature modify the aquatic \n\nfungal community composition and the litter processing can be stimulated, inhibited or \n\naffected depending of the thermal conditions tested (5-24\u00b0C) and the species identity \n\ninvolved in the assays (Fernandes et al. 2012; Geraldes et al. 2012; Duarte et al. 2013; \n\nMart\u00ednez et al. 2014).  \n\nSince aquatic fungi species differ in their temperature niche (Fernandes et al. 2012; \n\nJabiol et al. 2013) and assuming that their thermal tolerance range is wider in the species \n\nfrom temperate than from tropical latitudes (Sridhar and B\u00e4rlocher 1993), it is likely to \n\nexpect faster replacement of species along the tropical gradient than in the temperate one.  \n\n \n\n1.5 Molecular techniques \n\n \n\nTraditionally, the identification of aquatic hyphomycetes has been performed \n\nmicroscopically by conidia (asexual spores) morphology recognition, which makes it a \n\nhigh consuming method (Maharning and Barlocher 1996). Moreover, it is plausible that \n\nmany species are unable to produce spores under laboratory conditions and others have \n\nnot been described in the available keys (Duarte et al. 2007; B\u00e4rlocher and Marvanov\u00e1 \n\n2010). Molecular techniques has become a useful, quick and reliable tool to overcome \n\nthese drawbacks, because they allow to distinguish between genotypes within a \n\ncommunity, assessing an specific DNA region called genetic or molecular marker \n\n(Maharning and Barlocher 1996; B\u00e4rlocher 2007; Duarte et al. 2012), which is defined as \n\na gene or non-coding segment within the genome of organisms that displays enough \n\ngenetic variability (Schl\u00f6tterer 2004). \n\nDifferent markers have been developed for fungi and bacteria identification, based \n\non the polymorphism of the ribosomal genes, located within the RNA sequence (rRNA) \n\n(White et al. 1990; Karp 2005; B\u00e4rlocher 2007). The nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacer \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nor known as ITS region is useful for fungal phylogenetic and taxonomical analysis (White \n\net al. 1990; Bruns et al. 1991; Muyzer et al. 1993) and specifically the ITS2 region (Annex \n\n1.a) has proved to be a suitable sequence to assess the taxa diversity in aquatic fungi \n\n(Belliveau and B\u00e4rlocher 2005; B\u00e4rlocher 2007, 2010; Duarte et al. 2007, 2010). Unlike \n\neukaryotic organisms, the bacteria identification is assessed amplifying the variable \n\nregions from the 16S rRNA sequence (Annex 1.b), which encodes the small ribosomal \n\nsubunit in prokaryotes (Muyzer et al. 1993; Karp 2005). Both molecular markers display \n\nslow mutation rates that allow the identification of taxonomical units within a microbial \n\ncommunity (White et al. 1990; Muyzer et al. 1993). \n\nThe target sequences are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and \n\nthen resolved in a polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis, which allows the separation of \n\nthe segments through the pores of the matrix applying electric fields. The amplified \n\nsequence are visualized as bands in the gel (Karp 2005) and they are consider as \n\noperational taxonomic unit (OTU), which are not equivalent to species in large organisms \n\n(Fuhrman 2009). The use of fingerprinting techniques, such as the denaturing gradient gel \n\nelectrophoresis (DGGE), provide the genetic diversity profile of the microbial community \n\n(Muyzer and Smalla, 1998). In this technique, the amplified fragments with the same \n\nlength are denatured by the chemical gradient (formamide and urea concentrations) and \n\nthen each molecule gets halt when the double strand is separated according to the Guanine \n\n(G) and Citocine (C) content. It means that GC- rich sequences stop the migration in the \n\ngel at higher denaturing gradients, which remains attached by a GC tail of 40-bp added \n\nduring the amplification reaction (Muyzer et al. 1993; Muyzer and Smalla 1998; Duarte et \n\nal. 2007).  \n\nMolecular techniques allow inferences of taxa richness and environmental factors \n\nin situations in which poor taxonomical expertise are limiting factors and in which there \n\nfauna and flora are poorly known. This is particularly important when dealing with \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nmicroorganisms in the environment. It is plausible that is short time molecular techniques \n\nwill be common in studies addressing the identity and the role of microorganisms in the \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\n1.6 Thesis hypotheses \n\n \n\nHere I am testing five hypothesis relating diversity, function and biogeography. \n\nThe two first hypotheses relate temperature with function. If temperature controls \n\nmetabolism then, within a same geographic area, litter decomposition should decrease \n\nwith an increase in elevation since temperature predictably decrease with altitude \n\n(Hypothesis 1).  In the same way, microbial decomposition rates are expected to be faster \n\nat lower than higher latitudes (Hypothesis 2). The other two hypotheses relate diversity \n\nwith elevation. If the distribution of species richness depends of the thermal tolerance of \n\norganisms then, species diversity (? diversity) of bacterial and fungi would decrease with \n\nincreasing elevation because thermal fluctuations increase with elevation (Hypothesis 3) \n\nand higher microbial diversity is expected toward to the tropics (Hypothesis 4). Finally, \n\nmicrobial species turnover rates would be higher in the tropical gradients (? diversity) \n\nwhile we expect them to be lower at temperature gradients (Hypothesis 5). \n\nTo test these previous hypotheses I run litter decomposition experiments in two \n\nlatitudes: tropical (Ecuador) and temperate (United States, Colorado) systems and along \n\nan elevation gradient in both latitudes. Hypotheses 1 and 2 will be addressed in chapter 1 \n\nwhereas hypotheses 3, 4 and 5 will be addressed in chapter 2.  \n\nThis research is part of a large scale project called EVOTRAC (Evolutionary and \n\nEcological Variability in Organismal Trait Response with Altitude and Climate; Poff, et \n\nal. 2010), which main goal is predict the vulnerability of the organisms associated to the \n\nfreshwater systems due to the climate change using elevation gradients as a model to \n\nforesee changes in the biological processes and community structure.\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2. CHAPTER I \n\n \n\n \n\nMicrobial leaf litter decomposition along altitudinal gradients in \n\ntropical and temperate streams \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nThe main energy source of the aquatic organisms in low order streams is the organic \n\nmatter produced in the riparian zone (Vannote et al. 1980). Leaf litter material is \n\ntransformed and incorporated into higher levels of the food web by the action of microbial \n\ndecomposers and detritivores (Baldy et al. 1995; Gessner 1997; Gra\u00e7a et al. 2001). In the \n\nfirst stages of the decomposition, aquatic hyphomycetes colonize the leaves (conditioning) \n\ndecomposing the substrate due to their exoenzymes activity and enhancing the palatability \n\nfor macroinvertebrates (Gra\u00e7a 2001; Hieber and Gessner 2002; B\u00e4rlocher 2010). Variables \n\nsuch as leaf quality (Lecerf et al. 2007), nutrients dissolved in water (Gulis and \n\nSuberkropp 2004; Ferreira et al. 2006) and temperature (Boyero et al. 2011; Ferreira and \n\nChauvet 2011b; Mart\u00ednez et al. 2014) can retard or hasten the litter breakdown. \n\nLeaves with high leaf quality (high nitrogen concentration and low lignin content) \n\ntend to decompose faster than low quality leaves (Hobbie 2005; Lecerf et al. 2007; \n\nSchindler and Gessner 2009). Since aquatic hyphomycetes are the main microbial \n\ndecomposer in low order streams, their activity has being associated with the intrinsic leaf \n\nfeatures and its influence with the decomposition rate. Aquatic fungi grow faster and \n\nreproduce earlier on leaf substrates rich in nutrients with low concentrations of \n\npolyphenolic compounds (Canhoto and Gra\u00e7a 1996; Ferreira et al. 2012). Likewise,  \n\ntougher leaves are also more difficult to decompose by fungi (Ferreira and Chauvet \n\n2011a). \n\nAlthough nutrients in the leaves are important determining the decomposition rates, \n\naquatic hyphomycetes are also able to uptake nutrients from the water column (Ferreira et \n\nal. 2014). Nitrogen enrichment in streams stimulates fungal activity (e.g. growth, conidia \n\nproduction) and accelerate the decomposition rates despite the poor quality of the substrate \n\n(Gulis and Suberkropp 2003; Taylor and Chauvet 2014). Similar observations were \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nreported for phosphorous (Grattan and Suberkropp 2001). Consistently, microcosms and \n\nfield studies revealed that an increment of both, nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations \n\nin water, increase fungal biomass, sporulation and microbial respiration; and consequently, \n\nstimulate litter breakdown. The effect of higher levels of nutrients in the decomposition \n\nrates is more noticeable when the background conditions have lower concentrations \n\n(Ferreira and Chauvet 2011a; Grattan and Suberkropp 2001; Ferreira et al. 2014). \n\n Temperature also affects litter decomposition under laboratory conditions (Ferreira \n\nand Chauvet 2011b; Fernandes et al. 2012) and large scale studies suggest that \n\ntemperature microbial stimulation is more important at lower latitudes (Irons et al. 1994; \n\nBoyero et al. 2011). However, even when microbial activity seems to hasten leaf litter \n\nprocessing near to the equatorial line, others studies have reported lower microbial \n\ndecomposition rates and lower fungal activity (e.g. sporulation) in the tropics compare \n\nwith higher latitudes (Ferreira et al. 2012; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006, 2007). These results \n\nsuggesting that aquatic hyphomycetes may be playing a minor role in litter processing at \n\ntropics streams in contrast with previous reports.  \n\nSince temperature decreases 6\u00baC every 900 m in altitude increase (Sarmiento 1986; \n\nDudgeon 2008; NASA 2014), I may speculate that changes in altitudinal gradients in \n\nmountains could mirror changes in latitudinal gradients regarding biological diversity and \n\necological functional parameters, given the relationship between temperature and \n\nmetabolism (Brown et al. 2004). In a recent study, Taylor and Chauvet (2014) documented \n\nan increase of microbial litter breakdown rates along a river altitudinal gradient, with \n\nhigher rates in downstream sites. Authors concluded that temperature was the main \n\nenvironmental factor driving the decomposition. At present, it would be critical to analyze \n\nwhether microbial litter breakdown decreases in a similar fashion along both latitudinal \n\nand altitudinal gradients. \n\nGiven that litter breakdown is a biological process that depends on the enzymatic \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nactivity of microbial decomposers and knowing that the rate at which the molecules are \n\ntransformed depend of the kinetic energy available, which is measured as temperature; \n\nhigher metabolic rates are expected at higher temperatures due to an increment of the \n\nenzymatic transformations (Brown et al. 2004).  \n\nThe objective of this study was to test whether litter breakdown in streams changes \n\nalong an altitudinal gradient in lower and higher latitudes according to the metabolic \n\ntheory. If temperature is the major controller of microbial decomposition, I am expecting \n\nhigher decomposition rates in the tropical streams than in the temperate ones, and a \n\ndecrease in litter decomposition with an increase in elevation. In order to test these \n\nhypotheses, this study was carried out in low order streams within an altitudinal gradient \n\n(from 1600 to 3800 m.a.s.l.) in two latitudes: the tropic (Ecuador) and the temperate \n\n(Colorado, USA) zones using native congeneric Alnus species as the substrate deployed in \n\nlotic ecosystems. \n\n \n\n2.2 Methodology \n\nStudy sites \n\nThe hypothesis was tested in 10 first order streams located along an elevation \n\ngradient in two latitudes: Ecuador (tropical ecosystem at 0? Lat; five streams) and \n\nColorado, United States (temperate ecosystem at 40? Lat; five streams). The tropical sites \n\nare localized in Oyacachi sub-basin at the Andean Cordillera in the Napo catchment area \n\n(Amazon Basin) within a gradient from 1645 to 3847 m.a.s.l. The temperate streams are \n\nlocated at the Rocky Mountains Range in the Cache Poudre Basin along an altitudinal \n\ngradient spanning from 1992 to 3200 m.a.s.l. (Table 1, Annex 2). The tree line was located \n\nat 3000 m.a.s.l. in Ecuador and the riparian vegetation was composed by herbaceous plants \n\nin the upper sites, whereas in the lower locations the streams were covered by dense tree \n\ncanopy. There is a gradual increase in shrub and tree diversity along the gradient being \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nalways higher at the tropical site compared with the temperate region. In Ecuador the \n\nvegetation in the highlands was characterized for scrublands such as Calamagrostic sp.and \n\nFestuca sp., Andean bogs (Azorella spp.) and several shrubs (Gynoxis spp., Diplostephium \n\nspp.). In the lower sites the arboreal vegetation includes species such as Symplocos \n\nquitensis, Buddleja bullata, Alnus  acuminata Kunth., Weinmannia sp. and Myrica \n\npubescens.  Wider daily temperature fluctuations is registered between 3000 and 4500 \n\nm.a.s.l. (Rend\u00f3n 2012). Higher rainfall was registered along the gradient. In Colorado the \n\nvegetation above the 2700 m is mainly dominated by Picea abies, whereas the lower sites \n\nare characterized by Pinus spp. and Alnus incana. Markedly seasonality is recorded during \n\nthe year, with intermediated (&lt;2700) and persistent (>3000 m.a.s.l.) snow cover areas \n\n(Harrington et al. 2015). Geology in Ecuador is characterized by inceptisol type (MAGAP \n\n2012) and by gypsiferous for Colorado (Waltz 1969). \n\n \n\nStreams characterization  \n\nSelected streams for both latitudes were pristine or with low anthropogenic impact. \n\nFor each sampling site, canopy cover was estimated with a spherical densiometer in three \n\npoints of the stream within a 100 m section and then averaged to obtain the total measure \n\nfor each sampling site. At each location 4 counts were made facing upstream, right, left \n\nand downstream. For tropical sites, two indices were applied to characterize the quality of \n\nthe stream bed (fluvial habitat quality index; IFH; Annex 3) and the quality of the riparian \n\nvegetation  (QBR; Acosta et al. 2009; Annex 4).   \n\nDuring the study period (see below) stream water temperature was recorded hourly \n\nfor each site with submersed data loggers (Solinst Levelogger Junior Edge Water Level \n\nLoggers). Only for one tropical site E1805, the temperature was registered in situ with \n\npoint measurements using a field probe (YSI 63) once at each sampling date.  \n\nFor tropical streams, conductivity and pH (field probe YSI 63), dissolve oxygen \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n(field probe YSI 550A) as well as water discharge, were measured five times during the \n\nexperiments (details below). For nutrients analysis, 150 mL of stream water were \n\ncollected, filtered through fiber glass filters (47 mm \u00f8, pore size 0.7\u00b5m; Milipore, MA, \n\nUSA), transported in an ice chest to the laboratory, and frozen at -20\u00b0 C until being \n\nprocessed. Phosphorus was determined using the ascorbic acid method and read at 885 nm \n\n(Algilent Technologies, Cary 60 UV-Vis). Nitrates were measured with the cadmium \n\nreduction method (detection limit: 0.3 to 30.0 mg/L NO3\n-\nN), nitrites were determined with \n\nthe diazotization method (detection limit: 0.002 to 0.300 mg/L NO2\n-\nN), sulfates by the \n\nSulfaVer 4 method (detection limit: 2 to 7 mg/L SO4\n2-\n\n) and ammonia measurements were \n\nperformed by salicylate method (detection limit: 0.01 to 0.50 mg/L NH3-N), all of them \n\nusing a Hatch kit (Hatch Company). \n\nIn the temperate streams, all physic-chemical measurements were performed only \n\nonce during the experiment: conductivity and pH (field probe YSI30), dissolve oxygen \n\n(field probe YSI proODO) and discharge. For the nutrients analysis, water was collected \n\nin the same fashion than in the tropical sites and once in the laboratory water nitrates were \n\nmeasured using a Dionex 1100 ion chromotography  and phosphates were analyzed by the \n\nascorbic acid method using the Asoria2 Segmented flow analyzer (Astoria-Pacific, \n\nClackamas, OR).  \n\nAt both, tropical and temperate sites, fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) was \n\nsampled using a hollow cylinder device placed in a flat area on the stream bed. Sediments \n\nin the bottom were vigorously agitated and 1L of the confined water was filtered (250 mL) \n\nusing pre-weighed glass fiber filters (47 mm diameter GFF Whatman filters, USA) with a \n\nfield vacuum pump. Three samples were collected at each sampling occasion. Each filter \n\nwas transported to the laboratory into an aluminum envelope within an ice cooler and \n\nfroze at -20\u00b0 C until be oven dried (70\u00b0 C for 48 h), burned (550\u00b0 C for 4 h) and weighed \n\nto estimate ash free dry mass (AFDM), which was expressed in mass weight per area \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n(g/m\n2\n) for each date. FBOM was averaged for the dates collected at each sites to perform \n\nfurther analyses (detailed below).  \n\nAt both, tropical and temperate sites, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) \n\nwas collected along three random transects perpendicular to the stream, using a surber net \n\nbottom sampler (30 cm x 30 cm; 0.5 mm pore size). The CPOM samples collected across \n\neach transect were transported in individual Ziploc bags to the laboratory in an ice chest. \n\nOnce in the laboratory, samples were air dried for 24 hours, oven dried (70\u00b0 C for 48 h), \n\nweighed and ignited (550\u00b0 C for 4 h) to calculate the AFDM. Due to logistical constrains \n\nthe CPOM samples in Colorado were not ignited, but their AFDM was calculated \n\nmultiplying the DM coefficient of Colorado samples by a correction factor (0.77), which \n\nwas obtained from the relationship between DM/AFDM in the Ecuadorian samples \n\ncollected in this study and calculated with unpublished data collected in a decomposition \n\nexperiment carried out in Portugal by several authors (Capps et al. 2011; Gra\u00e7a and \n\nPoquet 2014; Ferreira 2014, personal communications). \n\n \n\nLitter decomposition experiment  \n\nMicrobial litter decomposition was measured using the litter bag method (15 x 17 \n\ncm, 0.5 mm mesh size). Alnus acuminata Kunth (tropical species) leaves were gathered \n\ndirectly from trees in two locations (0?14?46\u201dS; 78? 0?21\u201dW and 0?22?0\u201dS; 78? 8?0\u201dW) \n\nduring April and May 2013. Leaves were dry stored until needed. Bags containing 5.00 g \n\n(\u00b1 0. 02 S.D.) of litter were deployed in the streams on August 29\nth\n\n of 2013 and six \n\nreplicates were retrieved from each stream and at each sampling time after 3, 12, 30 and \n\n60 days. Alnus incana (L.) Moench (temperate species) leaves were collected directly \n\nfrom several threes (40\u00b0 49?48\u201dN; 105?43?32\u201dW) during June 2013. Five replicates with \n\nportions of 4.00 g (\u00b1 0. 02 S.D) were deployed in each stream site on July 26\nth\n\n of 2013 and \n\nthen recouped after 3, 12, 23 and 28 days. Experimental time in the temperate site was \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nshorter due to fast decomposition rates, even when the planned dates were the same as the \n\ntropical latitude.  \n\nLitterbags were placed in stream sections with moderate velocity and depth; they \n\nwere laid on the bottom and tied to a rod. Samples were recovered according the \n\nscheduled dates in individual Ziploc bags and transported to the laboratory inside a chest \n\nwith ice. In the laboratory they were gently washed with abundant distilled water to \n\nremove sediments. Leaf material was air dried for 24h and then oven dried (70\u00b0 C for 48 \n\nh), weighed, ignited in a muffle (550\u00b0 C for 4 h) and weighed again to calculate the ash \n\nfree dry mass (AFDM). Three additional replicate bags were transported to the field and \n\nreturned to the laboratory the first date of the experiment (Day 0) to calculate the loss \n\nmass by handling and to determine the corrections for air:oven dry mass (AFDM).  \n\n \n\nComparison of litter decomposition between Alnus species \n\nSince litter breakdown is affected by the chemical and physical quality of the \n\nleaves and by environment conditions, I carried out a second essay with leaves from both \n\nplant species in a same location (under identical environmental conditions) to investigate \n\nthe importance of the environment and intrinsic leaf characteristics differences in \n\ndecomposition rates. Fine mesh litter bags containing leaves of Alnus acuminata Kunth. \n\nand of Alnus incana  (5 and 3 replicates of each) were incubated in the Ecuadorian site \n\nE2838. The leaves were deployed in 5 October and recovered in 7 November 2014. They \n\nwere transported to the laboratory, dried and weighed as before to determine mass loss.  \n\n \n\nInitial litter quality \n\nInitial specific leaf area (SLA; as a surrogate of toughness), expressed as cm\n2\n g\n\n-1\n \n\nwas determined in 10 leaf discs (10 mm) taken with a cork borer from different leaves. \n\nLeaf discs were oven dried, weighted and registered. Initial concentration of Nitrogen (N), \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nCarbon (C), Phosphorus (P), total phenols and lignin content was determined from grinded \n\n(Retsch, ZM100) and oven dried at 105\u00b0 C, 24 h (total phenols, lignin and phosphorus) \n\nand at 60\u00b0C, 7 days (nitrogen and carbon). Polyphenolics were extracted from 100 mg of \n\nleaf powder (n=4) with 70% acetone and quantified by the Folin Ciocalteu method g \n\n(B\u00e4rlocher and Gra\u00e7a 2005). Lignin was extracted from 0.5 g (\u00b10.1 mg) leaf powder  \n\nportions (n=6) with 72% H2SO4 and quantified by the Klason lignin method (Goering and \n\nVan Soest 1970). Phosphorous was extracted from 0.002 (\u00b10.1) mg leaf powder portions \n\n(n=4) with NaOH 1M and Na2S2O8 0.5M (American Public Health Association 1998). \n\nCarbon and nitrogen were measured from 0.5 (\u00b10.2) mg leaf powder (n=4), were weighted \n\nand measured in an EA-IRMS (Thermo Delta V Advantage Conflo III and Flash EA 1112 \n\nseries). \n\nConsidering that Alnus acuminata Kunth leaves (tropical species) were collected in \n\ntwo localities but did not show significant differences of remaining mass loss in the first \n\nexperiment (p = 0.66; t-test), the leaf quality analyses were carried out with no distinction \n\nbetween sites. \n\n \n\nData analyses  \n\nEnvironmental parameters: In the tropical sites, stream physical and chemical parameters \n\nacross the five sites were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallys \n\n(H) when the data was not normally distributed. Dissolved oxygen data was subjected to \n\narc-sin transformation since original data was in percentage. Analyses were computed \n\nwith SigmaStat 3.5 statistical software. ANOVA tests were not calculated for the \n\ntemperate system since parameters were measured only once.   \n\n \n\nLitter decomposition: Decomposition rates (k/d) were computed as the slope of the \n\nregression of ash free dry mass remaining (log) over time. To account for temperature \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nvariations across sites, decomposition rates were also normalized using degree days \n\n(k/dd), substituting in the previous model the time for accumulative mean daily \n\ntemperature. In the case of the site E1805 (that did not have the temperature logger) the \n\naccumulated temperature during the experiment was determined assuming an average \n\ntemperature from one date to the next one.  \n\n \n\nRelation between the environment and decomposition: To determine the importance of \n\nenvironmental factors on litter breakdown, I performed a linear regression between decay \n\nrate (k/d) and the environmental variables which were significant different in the ANOVA \n\ntest with STATISTICA 7 software (StatSoft, OK, USA). Since dissolved oxygen and \n\nconductivity were autocorrelated with temperature in the tropical stream (Pearson and \n\nSpearman coefficients; SigmaStat 3.5 software), they were not considered as variable \n\nresponses.  \n\n \n\nTemperature coefficient (Q10) \n\nTemperature coefficient was computed for both latitudes using the following \n\nfunction: \n\n \n\nWhere k2 and k1 are the observed decay rates constant for the decomposition \n\nprocess at two temperatures, T2 and T1. Values of Q10 >1 means that the rate of the \n\nreaction is completely dependent  of the temperature (Kirschbaum 1995). \n\nToughness, nitrogen, phosphorous, polyphenolics and lignin content for both \n\nspecies of leaves, were compared by a pair unbalance t-test of two tails. T-test was also \n\nused to compare decomposition rates of A. incana in Ecuador and Colorado, and \n\ndecomposition rates of A. acuminata in both experiments. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Results \n\nStreams characterization   \n\nStream water temperature in Ecuador ranged from 6.9 \u00b0C in the highest site to 17.4 \n\n\u00b0C in the lowest site, whereas in Colorado it ranged from 6.5 \u2013 14.9 \u00b0C (Table 1). \n\nEcuadorian streams? substrate was composed mainly by cobble and pebbles and densely \n\ncovered by vegetation, except in the highest site where the boulder was the main substrate \n\nand the canopy cover was scarce. In Colorado substrate was dominated by sand and gravel \n\nand all sites were canopy covered (Table 2).    \n\nIn Ecuador streams were moderate alkaline and oxygenated (Table 3).  They were \n\nnot different in terms of CPOM (p = 0.249; F = 1.476; df = 4) nor FPOM (p = 0.190; \n\nF=1.705; df = 4); the variability was high in some streams (Figure 1). \n\nOnly four parameters differed along the gradient: temperature, conductivity, \n\ndissolved oxygen and levels of phosphates and sulfates in the water (Table 4). \n\nTemperature, conductivity, sulfates and oxygen decreased, while phosphorous increased \n\nwith elevation.  Some of such relationships were linear (temperature p = 0.002; R\n2 \n\n= 0.87; \n\ndissolved oxygen p = 0.001; R\n2 \n\n= 0.99; phosphorous; p = 0.016; R\n2 \n\n= 0.23). Additionally, \n\nconductivity and pH displayed a significant negative relationship with the altitude            \n\n(p = 8E-06; R\n2 \n\n= 0.68 and p = 0.013; R\n2 \n\n= 0.25, respectively), as well as sulfates               \n\n(p = 0.005; R\n2 \n\n= 0.29). In Colorado the environmental data set was nor so complete, but \n\ntemperature also decreased with altitude (regression analysis, p = 0.010; R\n2\n = 0.92) no \n\ntendency for altitudinal changes was observed (Table 5). None of the other parameters \n\nwere linearly related with elevation (p > 0.05). \n\nNitrates in Colorado were one order of magnitude higher than in Ecuador (11.28 \n\nvs. 0.40 \u00b5g/L; balance t-test with one tail, p = 0.04), but levels of phosphates were not \n\nstatistically different (6.75 \u00b5g/L in Colorado vs.11.29 \u00b5g/L Ecuador; t-test, p = 0.05), as in \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\ndischarge (0.017 in Colorado vs 0.14 m\n3\n/s in Ecuador; t-test, p = 0.05).  \n\n \n\nLitter decomposition \n\n In Ecuador, breakdown of Alnus acuminata leaves ranged from 0.0065 to 0.0144 \n\nk/d and decreased with increased altitude (linear regression, p = 0.00064; R\n2\n = 0.96). In \n\nColorado, the breakdown rates of Alnus incana ranged from 0.0197 to 0.0453 k/d without \n\nany tendency along the altitudinal gradient (linear regression, p = 0.48; R\n2 \n\n= 0.0005; Table \n\n6; Figure 2).  \n\nWhen the decay rates (k/d) were expressed in terms of degree days (k/dd), \n\ndifferences of decomposition rates among the tropical streams and along elevation \n\ndisappeared (linear regression, p = 0.002; R\n2 \n\n= 0.036). The global decomposition rate in \n\nk/dd for the Ecuadorian was -4E-08. In Colorado the faster decomposition in degree days \n\nwas observed in the three highest sites, compared with the two lowest sites (0.0016 \u2013 \n\n0.0044 k/dd; p = 0.76; R\n2 \n= 0.402; Figure 3).  \n\nLitter decomposition rates in Ecuador and Colorado were not related with \n\nphosphorous levels (linear regression; p = 0.17; R\u00b2 = 0.04 and p = 0.20; R\u00b2 = 0.633) and \n\nnether with nitrogen (linear regression; p = 0.80; R\n2 \n\n= 0.003 and p = 0.68; R\n2 \n\n= 0.06). The \n\nsame applies when the results were expressed in degree days (linear regression; \n\nphosphates: p = 0.08; R\n2 \n= 0.13 and p = 0.57; R\n\n2 \n= 0.19; nitrates: p = 0.63; R\n\n2 \n= 0.01 and p \n\n= 0.20; R\n2 \n\n= 0.47). \n\nTherefore only in the tropical streams litter breakdown were explained by \n\ntemperature. In the temperate streams other environmental factors seems to be influencing \n\nstrongly the decomposition  \n\nFinally, the Q10 in tropical and temperate streams were 1.89 and 1.27, respectively. \n\nBoth factors calculated to determine the dependence of the decomposition rate with the \n\ntemperature were above 1, which means that litter breakdown in both latitudes are \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\ncompletely dependent of the temperature.  \n\nThe analyses of these contradictory results will be discussed later on. \n\n \n\nComparison of litter decomposition between Alnus species \n\nLitter decomposition was faster in Ecuador than in Colorado (k = 0.0098 vs. \n\n0.0262; p &lt;0.0001 \u2013 t-test). To investigate whether differences were due to (a) litter \n\nquality, (b) environmental conditions or (c) latitude, I firstly analyzed the litter properties. \n\nA. acuminata leaves had higher lignin content and low SLA compared with A. \n\nincana which was soften.  Polyphenolics content in A. acuminata was three times higher \n\nthan its counterpart. A. incana had lower nitrogen and high phosphorous than A. \n\nacuminata (Table 7). Therefore, except for nitrogen, A. incana was a better quality \n\nsubstrate for decomposers than A. acuminata. \n\nWhen exposing leaves of both species under the same environmental conditions \n\n(site E2838, Ecuador), breakdown rates of the tropical A. acuminata were still slower than \n\nA. incana (unbalance t-test with two tails; p = 0.038), although its k values increased 61% \n\ncompared with the first experiment. There were no differences in breakdown rates of A. \n\nincana leaves when exposed in both latitudes (unbalance t-test with two tails; p = 0.11; \n\nFigure 4). \n\n \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\nSince the latitude and the elevation can be used as a surrogate of the temperature \n\n(Rahbek 2004) and considering that metabolic activity lies in the thermodynamic laws \n\n(Brown et al. 2004), this study assessed the relevance of the temperature as the main \n\nenvironmental factor controlling the microbial decomposition in freshwater systems along \n\nan altitudinal gradient in the tropical and temperate latitude. \n\nAs hypothesized, for the tropical system, decomposition decreased with increased \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\naltitudes. The results, were consistent with the study carried out along an altitudinal \n\ngradient in a temperate river by Taylor and Chauvet (2014), in which small rises of \n\ntemperature increased the litter breakdown rates. This trend was confirmed when the \n\ntemperature effect were factored out (degree days-1). However, contrary to my \n\nhypothesis, Colorado streams did not exhibited the expected tendency despite the water \n\ntemperature changes with elevation. Considering that the positive trend was deployed only \n\nin the tropical system, other variables might be influencing strongly the breakdown rates. \n\nSuch variables will be discussed further down. \n\nAccording to the MTE, microbial metabolism is predicted to increase with \n\ntemperature and consequently, accelerating the litter processing. Since the enzymatic \n\nactivity depends directly on temperature to degrade the substrate (Peterson et al. 2004), \n\nfungal enzymes would catalyze faster the transformation of organic matter as the \n\ntemperature increases. Laboratory experiments have determined that the magnitude of the \n\nstimulation on litter decomposition depends on the fungal optimum ranges of the aquatic \n\nhyphomycetes species involved (Fernandes et al. 2009, 2012; Geraldes et al. 2012), \n\nconsidering that sensitivity of the enzymatic activity is affected when the temperature rises \n\nor decreases out of their optimal limits (around 10\u00b0 C; Ferreira et al. 2014) . Therefore, the \n\nhigher decomposition rates recorded at lower altitudes in the Ecuadorian gradient, suggest \n\nthat fungal communities at higher elevations might be still below of their thermal \n\noptimum limit, which is translated in lower metabolic activity of aquatic hyphomycetes \n\nthat slowdowns the leaf litter processing.  \n\nThe temperature dependence of the microbial leaf litter decomposition in Ecuador \n\nwas corroborated with the thermal coefficient value (Q10= 1.89), which is comparable with \n\nother biological processes such as soil respiration (Q10= 2.4; Raich and Schlesinger 1992) \n\nand terrestrial  decomposition (Q10 = 2.12; K\u00e4tterer et al. 1998). \n\nContrary to the tendency found between the decomposition rates and the \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\ntemperature along the altitudinal gradient in Ecuador, Colorado streams did not display \n\nany relationship with the temperature as the main variable controlling this process, despite \n\nthe Q10 value (1.27) determined the opposite. Probably, there are other environmental \n\nfactors such as nutrients in water (Ferreira  et al. 2014), in this case specifically the high \n\nnitrogen concentration and microbial community assemblages (Fernandes et al. 2012) that \n\nare affecting the decomposition, overriding the temperature effect determined by the \n\nthermal coefficient. \n\n Nitrogen and phosphorous have been identified as limiting macronutrients \n\nresponsible to affect decomposition in lotic freshwater ecosystems (Suberkropp and \n\nChauvet 1995; Gulis and Suberkropp 2004; Hobbie 2005; Ferreira et al. 2006). However, \n\nnone of these nutrients were correlated with the litter breakdown. Studies of litter \n\ndecomposition in terrestrial systems reveal that limiting concentrations of micronutrients \n\nmight affect the litter breakdown rates (Hobbie 2008; Kaspari et al. 2008; Powers and \n\nSalute 2011). For instance, Manganese (Mn) constrains could reduce the  lignolytic \n\nactivity of microorganisms (Kaspari et al. 2008) and the lower levels of Postasium (K) \n\ncould diminish the cytoplasmic transmission, restricting the substrate colonization and \n\nresource uptake (Powers and Salute 2011). Probably, the absence of the trend along the \n\ntemperate gradient could be the result of a great variability of the local environmental \n\nvariables, which should be investigated further.  \n\nIn terms of latitudinal comparisons, lower decomposition rates were recorded in \n\nEcuador than in Colorado, contrary to the expectations. Decay rates (k/d) values recorded \n\nin the current study for tropical and temperate streams were consistent with the literature \n\n(0.0060 and 0.017, respectively) using Alnus leaves as substrate (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006; \n\nFerreira et al. 2012). Some studies have documented slower microbial litter breakdown \n\nrates in tropical streams compared with their counterparts in the temperate areas \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Boyero et al. 2011). Then, even when the microbial decomposition \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\ndepends of the temperature and should be faster as it increases toward to the tropics, the \n\nopposite pattern recorded in this study might be the result of certain regional factors that \n\ncould override the temperature effect. \n\nThe incubation of both leaf species in the same stream site (E2838) in Ecuador \n\nreveled that differences in litter breakdown between Ecuador and Colorado were partially \n\ndue to litter quality and partially due to environmental local conditions. Since the litter \n\nprocessing is affected by the leaf quality (Baldy et al. 1995; Ferreira et al. 2012; Schindler \n\nand Gessner 2009), researchers have employed the use of a single species (e.g. Alnus \n\nglutinosa) to compare the decay rate among different ecosystems (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; \n\nBoyero et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the use of exogenous species may lead to misconstrue \n\nthe results because the performance of the decomposers will not reflect what happens in \n\nnatural conditions. In order to overcome this issue, the current research used native Alnus \n\nspecies.  \n\nThe high lignin content and the elevated production of secondary metabolites \n\n(polyphenolics), as well as the poor nutrient quality (low C:N ratio) of the leaves in \n\ntropical areas, have been documented as an evolutionary strategy of plants against the high \n\nherbivory rates (Coley and Barone 1996).  The higher concentrations of polyphenolics in \n\nA. acuminate might retard the microbial colonization. However, due to these secondary \n\ncompounds are easily washed out in the leaching phase of the process (Gra\u00e7a and Cressa \n\n2010), others intrinsic leaf factors seems to be more relevant. In lotic systems, the lignin \n\ncontent has been identified as the major factor limiting the decomposition (Hobbie 2005; \n\nSuberkropp and Chauvet 1995; Fernandes et al. 2012). Since the lignin-rich content in the \n\nleaf provides higher toughness (Perez et al. 2000), higher investment of microbial \n\ndecomposers to degrade this constitutive compound is required (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; \n\nGra\u00e7a and Cressa 2010; Ferreira et al. 2012). Despite A. acuminate had higher nitrogen \n\ncontent compared with A. incana, the higher toughness in the tropical leaf might be \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nlimiting the fungal activity and as result, the litter decomposition was slower in the \n\ntropical latitude. Lower phosphorous levels in the tropical leaf would be an unlikely \n\nexplanation limiting the decomposition because it is quickly washed in the initial stage of \n\nthe leaching phase (Sangkyu and Kang?Hyun 2003; Gessner et al. 2010). \n\nThe higher loss mass exhibited by A. acuminata leaf in this second experiment is \n\nbeyond of my scope, nonetheless it might be due to higher nutrients in the water (data no \n\nrecorded) and the increment of 2.3\u00b0 C of temperature that correspond to 52.4 degree days \n\nof difference (data not shown) between the experiments, which may lead to hasten the \n\nprocess. The synergistic effect of both variables might enhance the microbial activity and \n\nas a result, the decomposition process was faster (Ferreira and Chauvet 2011a) . On the \n\nother hand, the lower decomposition rate of A. incana might be related with the fungal \n\nassemblage community in the site, which probably was not efficient enough to degrade \n\nthis foreign substrate, as have been suggested by Gon\u00e7alves and collaboratores (2007). \n\nConsidering the higher energy cost that represents to uptake nutrients directly from \n\nthe substrate (Ferreira, et al. 2014), microbial decomposers may be using preferentially \n\nnitrates from the water to compensate the low nitrogen content of A. incana leaf. The \n\nvelocity of the enzymatic reaction can be measured based on the substrate availability by \n\nthe Michaelis-Mentel model and according to the results published by Ferreira and \n\ncollaborators (2006), the litter breakdown rate (degree days\n-1\n\n) increases exponentially \n\nwhen the concentrations of nitrates in water range between 0 and 100 \u00b5g/L. The higher \n\nlevels of nitrates registered in Colorado streams suggest that even when decomposition is \n\ndependent of the temperature (Raich and Schlesinger 1992; Tjoelker et al. 2001), nitrates \n\nconcentrations in water hasten the process, as reported for other authors (Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n\n2006, 2007). Because in the tropical sites the nitrates levels in water were significantly \n\nlower (one order of magnitude difference), the temperature effect in the decomposition \n\nrates was clearly detected. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nIn summary, the results obtained in this study suggest that microbial \n\ndecomposition is ruled by the temperature, as predicts the MTE. Nevertheless, leaf \n\nphysical and chemical features such as the poor leaf quality (high lignin content) (Hobbie \n\n2005; Fernandes et al. 2012) on the tropical leaves, delayed the litter breakdown. \n\nConcurrently, in the temperate system the microbial decomposition was hasten by the \n\nhigher nitrogen concentrations dissolved in water. It seems that even when the microbial \n\ndecomposition is temperature dependent, this process is strongly influenced by inherent \n\nlocal factors that can nullify the temperature effect along the altitudinal gradients. \n\nConsidering that decomposition includes microbial and macroinvertebrates decomposers, \n\nfuture experiments are required to determine if the overall process would exhibit the same \n\ntemperature dependence obtained in this study.  \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3. CHAPTER II \n\n \n\nMicrobial decomposers diversity in tropical and temperate streams \n\nalong an altitudinal gradient \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe latitudinal increment in species richness towards the equator, has been \n\nrecorded for several organisms in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments (Gaston \n\n2000; Hawkins 2001; Hawkins and Felizola 2004). Nevertheless, this unimodal trend \n\ndiffers among taxonomic groups (Willig et al. 2003) and have not been well stablished for \n\nmicroorganisms such as fungi and bacteria, probably because their lack of knowledge, \n\nhigh abundance and cosmopolitan distribution (Fierer et al. 2007, 2011). \n\nDifferent hypotheses have been proposed to explain the latitudinal variation in \n\nspecies richness. Those include the larger areas of tropical systems, primary production \n\ngradients, climate patterns and stability, biotic interactions such as the intensity of \n\npredation and competition, as well as the evolutionary history of the species (Krebs 2001; \n\nMolles 2010). If high number of taxonomical groups follow this ubiquitous tendency, \n\nthere should be a prevailing  component along the different geographical habitats shaping \n\nthis patterns of species richness (Hawkins 2001; Martiny et al. 2006). Then, since \n\ntemperature changes gradually from the poles towards to the tropics, as happens with the \n\nspecies richness, the evolutionary adaptations of the organisms and their habitat \n\ncolonization might be explained broadly by this environmental factor and others that \n\ncovariate with it (Rosenzwig 1992; Gaston 2000).  \n\nHigher latitudes exhibit larger annually temperature fluctuations compared with \n\nthe tropics, where only daily seasonality is documented (Janzen 1967; Sarmiento 1986; \n\nGhalambor et al. 2006). Consequently, due to evolutionary adaptations, tropical organisms \n\nliving at lower latitude should experience narrow thermal tolerance ranges that constrain \n\ntheir habitat niche and  lead to harbor higher species diversity (Janzen 1967).  \n\nAdditionally, since the temperature also decreased with elevation, is reasonable to expect \n\nthat the altitudinal gradients mirror the latitudinal species richness changes. High altitude \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nsites can be considered as isles from the biogeographic point of view (MacArthur and \n\nWilson 1963), because their smaller area (Lomilino 2001) and their distance between \n\nmountain tops, lower number of species is likely to inhabit high elevation sites. \n\nThe spatial distribution patterns of the local species richness (? diversity) and \n\nwithin a region (? diversity) has been widely documented (Rosenzweig and Sandlin 1997). \n\nHowever, less attention has been given to the variation of species along habitat gradients \n\nsuch as the elevation. The degree of species changes across habitats and along gradients is \n\nknown as ? diversity (Whittaker 1972).  Since species are evolutionary adapted to occupy \n\na certain niche constrained by their physiological adaptations (Janzen 1967), along an \n\nhabitat gradient the species composition is likely to experience changes because they \n\nmight display niches overlap.  \n\nThe rate at which the air temperature changes in terrestrial systems are more \n\nextreme than in the aquatic environments (Molles 2010), due to the thermal capacity of \n\nwater (Doods 2002). As a consequence, aquatic species are likely to exhibit different \n\npatterns of adaptations in response of these temperature variations. Hence, the thermal \n\ntolerance limits in the tropical organisms might be expected to be wider, but there is still \n\nexpected to find differences between the tropical and temperate latitudes if the \n\ntemperature is leading the species distribution. \n\nIn low order streams, the input of allochthonous organic matter is consider one of  \n\nthe main energy source for aquatic biota, which include aquatic fungi and bacteria. \n\nAquatic hyphomycetes, accounts more than the 87% of the total microbial biomass \n\nassociated to the decomposing leaves in forested streams in temperate systems (Baldy et \n\nal. 1995), for that reason, and because they produce enzymes capable of decomposing \n\nleaves, they are considered to be the main decomposers in stream (Hieber and Gessner \n\n2002; Baldy et al. 1995), increasing the nutrient content and facilitating \n\nmacroinvertebrates feeding through softening the leaves (Gra\u00e7a 2001). However, bacteria \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nmain gain more relevance at later stages of leaf litter decomposition (Baldy et al. 1995; \n\nGessner and Chauvet 1997). Hence, fungi could be important decomposers of CPOM \n\nwhile bacteria in FPOM (Gessner and Chauvet 1997). Therefore, both would have \n\ncomplementary roles in the lotic decomposition (Gra\u00e7a 2001). \n\nAquatic hyphomycetes and bacteria may exhibit synergistic relationships if their \n\nenzymatic capabilities are complementary (Bengtsson 1992; Gulis and Suberkropp 2003). \n\nNonetheless, it was also postulated that fungi and bacteria may interact antagonistically \n\n(Gulis and Suberkropp 2003) and compete for the limited amount of nutrients in leaf \n\nsubstrate (Schneider et al. 2010).  \n\nThe potential dispersion and the high density described by microorganisms, may \n\nexplain the ubiquitous distribution of unicellular organisms such as bacteria. In marine \n\nenvironments, the richness of planktonic bacteria  displays a strong positive correlation \n\nwith temperature as  the latitude decreases (Fuhrman et al. 2008).  In lentic freshwater \n\nsystems, the distribution of bacteria is mainly controlled by pH and temperature \n\n(Lindstr\u00f6m et al. 2005). The positive correlation between the bacteria distribution with the \n\npH has also been described for terrestrial bacterial communities, which tend to decreases \n\nas the soils becomes more acid independently of the altitude, the latitude and temperature \n\n(Lindstr\u00f6m 2000; Fierer and Jackson 2006; Fuhrman 2009). Bacterial decomposers vary \n\ngreatly according the substrate characteristics and contrary to fungi, the richness of  \n\nbacteria taxa tend to increase toward the end of the decomposition (Das et al. 2007). \n\nStudies along an altitudinal gradient and between different latitudes with terrestrial \n\nbacteria colonizing the surface soil and leaves demonstrated the absence of the unimodal \n\npattern described for larger organisms (Fierer and Jackson 2006). However, there is still a \n\nbarely knowledge regarding how the species richness and composition of bacteria \n\ninvolved in the litter breakdown in streams vary along temperature gradients in a broad \n\nspatial scale. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nRegarding aquatic hyphomycetes, they exhibited a cosmopolitan distribution, \n\nalthough some taxa may have a more restricted distribution (Wong et al. 1998). In the \n\nonly study across several latitudes, aquatic hyphomycetes were shown to be more diverse \n\nat middle latitudes, around the temperate and Mediterranean areas (Jabiol et al. 2013). \n\nNevertheless, the lack of studies comparing the fungal species richness along an \n\naltitudinal gradient and nether the thermal tolerance limits of taxa at different latitudes. \n\nTraditionally, the identification of aquatic hyphomycetes was based on the conidia \n\nmorphological characteristics (asexual spores), which is highly time consuming and \n\ndepends on the capability to obtain conidia under laboratory conditions (Duarte et al. \n\n2007; B\u00e4rlocher and Marvanov\u00e1 2010). Fingerprinting techniques allow the identification \n\nof genetic variation within a community and for this reason, the use of molecular \n\ntechniques assessing the polymorphisms of the ribosomal genes, located within the RNA \n\nsequence (rRNA), have been implemented as a useful tool for phylogentic and \n\ntaxonomical analyses (White et al. 1990, Belliveau and B\u00e4rlocher 2005; B\u00e4rlocher 2010). \n\nNuclear Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2 region) is a suitable marker to assess the \n\naquatic hyphomycetes taxa diversity (Belliveau and B\u00e4rlocher 2005; Duarte et al. 2007, \n\n2010). For bacteria the marker is the 16S rRNA sequence within the small ribosomal \n\nsubunit (Muyzer et al. 1993; Karp 2005). In microorganisms the use of fingerprinting \n\ntechniques, such as the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) allow to visualize \n\nbands, which are considered as operational taxonomic unit (OTU), which are not \n\nequivalent to species in large organisms (Fuhrman 2009). \n\nHere I test several hypotheses regarding the biodiversity changes along altitudinal \n\ngradients in two latitudes, using molecular biology techniques to assess decomposers \n\ndiversity. Since prevailing temperatures may determine the thermal tolerance ranges of the \n\norganisms as was proposed by Janzen, the temperature is likely to affect the number of \n\nmicrobial species and the community composition, which can be translated in the \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nmodification of the leaf litter decomposition. Laboratory experiments have determined \n\nthat the identity of species involved in this process, matters more than the species number \n\n(Fernandes et al. 2012; Geraldes et al. 2012; Duarte et al. 2013). Considering that higher \n\nlatitudes exhibit higher seasonality during the year compared with the tropical systems, \n\nwhere the organisms? dispersion is constrained by their thermal tolerance ranges, the \n\nspecies richness of microbial decomposers (aquatic hyphomycetes and bacteria) is \n\nexpected to be higher in the tropical latitude than in the temperate regions, according the \n\nJanzen hypothesis (Janzen 1967). In the same way, due to the temperature variation as the \n\nelevation increases, the number of microbial taxa (fungi and bacteria) would decrease with \n\nthe altitude, as has also predicted by the Biogeography Island theory, because the area is \n\nlarger in the lowlands. Furthermore, due to the physiological constrains of the organisms, \n\nthe species turnover in the tropics is likely to be higher than in the temperate areas, where \n\nhigher similarity of taxonomical groups are expected to be shared within the gradient. \n\nTo test these hypotheses I assessed the taxa richness and community composition \n\nof microbial decomposers (aquatic fungi and bacteria) involved in the leaf litter processing \n\nin10 low order streams along an altitudinal gradient in a tropical (Ecuador) and temperate \n\nlatitude (Colorado, USA; see previous chapter) by the DGGE technique. Leaves of Alnus \n\nacuminatada and Alunes incana were deployed in fine mesh bags (0.5 mm) in 5 sites \n\nalong altitudinal gradients in Ecuador (1645-3847 m.a.s.l.) and Colorado, USA (1992-\n\n3200 m.a.s.l.), respectively. The methodology is detailed in chapter 1. \n\n \n\n3.2 Methodology \n\n \n\nGeneral information \n\nLeaves of two riparian trees in Ecuador and Colorado were used in litter \n\nbreakdown experiments. Portions of leaves were enclosed in fine mesh bags and incubated \n\nin streams along altitudinal gradients in both systems to measure decomposition and \n\nassociated microbial communities. The experimental design is detailed in chapter 1. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nMicrobial DNA samples \n\nPrimary material for DNA extraction was obtained from three replicate of fine \n\nmesh bags (0.5 mm mesh size; 5 x 5 cm) containing 2 to 3 alder leaves: Alnus acuminata \n\nin Ecuador and Alnus incana in Colorado (Table 1, chapter 1). Replicate bags were \n\nrecovered after 3, 12 and 32 days in tropical and 3, 12, 23 and 28 days in temperate \n\nstreams. Samples were washed with distilled water, placed into an aluminum envelope, \n\ntransported in liquid nitrogen to the laboratory and storage at -80\u00b0 C until being processed. \n\n \n\nMicrobial DNA extraction and amplification \n\nFungal and bacteria DNA extraction was performed with MoBio Power Soil DNA \n\nIsolation Kit\u2122 using 3 freeze-dried leaf discs of 12 mm of diameter (\u00bc of 4 leaf discs was \n\ncut from each replicate and pooled) following the manufacturer?s instruction (Annex 5). \n\nDNA was eluted in 100 \u00b5l of 10mM Tris buffer, storage at -20\u00b0C and used as template for \n\nPCR amplifications. Replicates bags were pooled and treated as one sample to maximize \n\nthe number of taxonomical units by site. \n\nMicrobial diversity of the 35 samples was assessed in two independent \n\namplification reactions with different primer sets.  To assess the fungal assemblage the \n\nITS2 region of the rDNA sequence was amplified using ITS3GC/ITS4 pair primers. \n\nBacteria were analyzed with the primer set 338GC/518 that targets the V3 region located \n\nin the 16S rDNA sequence. The total volume of the amplification reaction was performed \n\nin 25 \u00b5l containing 1X of GoTaq\u00ae Green Master Mix (Promega), 0.4 \u00b5M of each primer \n\nset and 1 \u00b5L of template DNA. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in a T100\u2122 \n\nthermocycler (BIO-RAD) following the protocol detailed by Sahadevan et al. (2012) with \n\nan initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes; 36 cycles with a denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 \n\nseconds, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute; and a \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nfinal  polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. To confirm the amplification of the target \n\nsequences with both primer sets, PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 2% \n\nagarose gel at 80 V for 30 minutes with an expected size product between 380 and 400 bp \n\nfor fungi and 200 bp for bacteria. \n\n \n\nDenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) \n\nPCR confirmed products (20 \u00b5l) were resolved in an 8% polyacrylamide \n\ndenaturing gel in 1X TAE (Tris Acetate-EDTA) and run at 56\u00b0C, 55 V during 16 hours in \n\na DCode\u2122 Universal mutation Detection System (BIO-RAD). Three acrylamide gels \n\nwere prepared for fungi and bacteria, separately. The denaturing gradient used for fungal \n\namplification products was 40% to 70% and for bacteria 30% to 70%, where 100% \n\ndenaturant corresponds to 40% formamide and 7M urea (Annex 6).  For gels alignment \n\npurposes, the extremes lines of each gel were occupied by 20 \u00b5l of a DNA mixture \n\ncontaining 4\u00b5l of 9 aquatic hyphomycetes species and 4 bacteria species, pooled \n\nseparately according the electrophoresis run. The species used for the DNA mixtures were \n\nextracted and amplified with the same protocol described above from isolated strands \n\nwhich are deposited in the Biodiversity Laboratory at the University of Braga (Annex 7).  \n\nTo visualize the fingerprinting pattern on the polyacrylamide matrix, the gel was \n\nstained with 10 \u00b5l of Midora Green\u00ae and incubated during 10 minutes at 18\u00b0C in \n\ndarkness and agitation at 40 RPM. The images were captured under UV light in a \n\ntransiluminator (Molecular imager\u00ae Gel Doc\u2122 XR, BIO-RAD) using the Quantity One \n\nXMS software (BIO-RAD). \n\n \n\nStatistical analyses \n\nFor the microbial analyses, the alignment and normalization of the acrylamide gels \n\nwere performed with the BioNumerics software (version 5.0). To align the three gels of \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nfungi and bacteria, the bands selected in the reference line were the ones strongly marked \n\nand clearly separated from each other. Once that the bands were selected in the first gel, \n\nthe same bands were chosen in the reference lines from the remaining gels, in order to \n\nmake the comparisons possible among them. Band selection in the samples lines were \n\naccomplished with the following criteria: 1) clearly and defined bands with black and \n\nwhite background; 2) ambiguous bands were marked if they showed a define peak \n\ncomparable with the bands previously selected. Smearing was assumed when the profile \n\nof the peak was bolder and excluded from the analyses. The software generates a matrix \n\nbased on the height and intensity of the bands, which was used for further analyses \n\n(BioNumerics software 5.0 Manual). \n\nEach DGGE band selected was considered as an operational taxonomic unit \n\n(OTU), taking into account that more than one species could migrate to the same position \n\nin the gel. The number of OTUs for each stream was recorded by time counting the bands \n\nin the respectively line, whereas the total number of OTUs by site was determined \n\nconsidering that DGGE bands that appear at the same height for all sampling dates must \n\nbe counted only once. Fungal and bacteria assemblages were analyzed independently. \n\nTo determine if the time or the altitude influences on the number of microbial \n\ntaxonomic units (fungi and bacteria, independently), an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) \n\nwas performed for Ecuador and Colorado. The homocedasticity assumption of the data \n\nwas corroborated with the Barlett test, as well as the normality of the model applying the \n\nShapiro test (R studio). The relationship between total number of OTUs at stream and the \n\nelevation was investigated with a regression analysis (OTUs vs. elevation). To identify the \n\ncauses of OTUs along the altitudinal gradient in Ecuadorian and Colorado, environmental \n\nparameters were normalized and related using the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) \n\nwith Primer v6. Afterwards, the five first axes scores obtained from the PCA were \n\ncorrelated with the total number of OTUs for fungi and bacteria, separately. For Ecuador \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nthe conductivity and oxygen were excluded of the analyses because were highly correlated \n\nwith temperature. In the case of Colorado, the PCA was performed excluding phosphates \n\nbecause of missing data in site C1992. \n\nIn a next step and to investigate taxa turnover along the elevation gradient, only \n\nthree comparable altitudes were selected (3415, 2838 and 1805 m in Ecuador and 3200, \n\n2798 and 1992 m in Colorado) to allow further comparisons between latitudes. The \n\nsimilarity among samples was calculated with the Bray Curtis index followed by \n\nANOSIM analyses, in which values near to 1 means higher separation among factors, \n\nallowing the identification of taxa composition of microbial decomposers at each \n\naltitudinal gradient (indirect measure of taxa turnover). \n\nSince fungi from terrestrial origin may remain in litter substrates during early \n\nstages of decomposition (Ferreira et al. 2012), day 3 was not included in data analyses. \n\nThis assumption was confirmed in the exploratory analyses, in which samples from day 3 \n\ntended to form groups (cluster analysis). For consistency, the same was applied to \n\nbacteria. Two samples, one from Colorado (2590m, day 23) and one from Ecuador \n\n(1645m, day 32), were excluded from the fungal and bacteria analyses respectively, due to \n\nthe methodological drawbacks in the PCR. \n\nThe total number of OTUs in Ecuador and Colorado were compared by a pair t-\n\ntest. To identify the differences of species composition between latitudes, the output \n\nmatrix from the BioNumerics software was exported, square root transformed and \n\nnormalized using Bray-Curtis similarity to perform a metric multidimensional scaling \n\n(MDS) with 999 permutations and to build cluster applying the Unweightened Paire-\n\nGroup Method Average (UPGMA) in Primer v6 software package. The differences among \n\ngroups were calculated by the analyses of similarities (ANOSIM) using the same \n\nstatistical software.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n3.3 Results \n\n3.3.1 Aquatic fungi \n\nAltitudinal gradients \n\nEcuador \n\nThe number of fungal OTUs were not significantly different across sampling dates \n\nand altitudes (one way ANOVA; p = 0.54; F = 0.68; df = 2 for time and p = 0.11; F = 2.7; \n\ndf = 4 by altitude; Figure 5.a). However, when the total number of OTUs is considered for \n\neach stream (all samples pooled), the number of aquatic fungi increased with the elevation \n\n(p = 0.03; R\n2 \n\n= 0.83; Figure 6.a).  \n\nThe two first axis of PCA explained 74% of the variability (three axis = 93%; \n\nFigure 7; Annex 9). The number of fungal OTUs was inversely correlated with the first \n\nPCA axis (r = -0.97; Annex 10). FPOM and PO4 decreased along this axis. These results \n\nsuggest that the main environmental factor influencing the OTUs numbers along the \n\naltitudinal gradient in Ecuador were phosphates in water. \n\nFungal composition on the three selected altitudes (3415, 2838 and 1805 m) along \n\nthe tropical gradient were similar (ANOSIM; p = 0.5; R\n2 \n\n= 0.004), meaning that streams \n\nshare many taxonomical units of aquatic fungi among the analyzed streams. \n\n \n\nColorado  \n\nThere were not significantly differences in the number of OTUs for the aquatic \n\nfungi when time and altitude were analyzed independently in Colorado (ANOVA;            \n\np = 0.71; F = 0.47; df  = 3 for time and p = 0.16; F = 1.97; df = 4 by altitude; Figure 5.b). \n\nUnlike of the unimodal tendency recorded in the tropical gradient between elevation and \n\nthe overall OTUs number by stream, the fungal richness in the temperate sites displayed a \n\nGaussian curve with the elevation (p = 0.7; R\n2 \n\n= 0.57), in which the maximum number of \n\ntaxa was attained at 2212 m and then decreasing above and below this value (Figure 6.b).  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nThe two main axis of the PCA for Colorado streams explained 82% of the \n\nvariability (three axis = 92%; Figure 8, Annex 11). The number of fungal OTUs was \n\nstrongly correlated with the third axis (correlation; r = -0.88), which, in turn, was \n\ncorrelated positively with NO3 (0.629) and negatively with CPOM standing stock (-0.545; \n\nAnnex 11). These results suggested that moderate concentrations of nitrate in water, \n\nhigher amounts of CPOM and shallow waters could be responsible for the higher number \n\nof taxonomical units of aquatic fungi in the temperate studied system.  \n\nSpecies composition of aquatic fungi along the elevation zones (3200, 2798 and \n\n1992 m) were different (ANOSIM; p = 0.003; global R= 0.5), particularly the highest and \n\nthe lowest sites (p = 0.03; global R= 0.57 between 3200-1992 and p = 0.03; global R = \n\n0.57 between 2798 and 1992). \n\n \n\nLatitudinal comparisons \n\nThe number of fungal taxonomic units (OTUs) recorded in Ecuador (n = 13.3) and \n\nColorado (n = 15.2) was not statistically different (t-test; p = 0.2; t =1.43; df = 8) between \n\nlatitudes. The community composition of aquatic fungi differed between the tropical and \n\nthe temperate latitude (ANOSIM; p = 0.001; global R = 0.69; Figure 9; see also Annex \n\n13).  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Bacteria \n\nAltitudinal gradients \n\nEcuador \n\nThe number of bacteria taxonomical units did not significantly differ across time \n\nnor altitude in the five tropical streams (ANOVA; p = 0.57; F = 0.61; df = 2 for time and p \n\n= 0.08; F= 3.2; df = 4 by altitude; Figure 10.a). However, when the total number of OTUs \n\nrecorded in the three sampling dates were pooled, lower altitudes in the gradient harbored \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nhigher number of bacterial taxa (p = 0.0001; R\n2 \n\n= 0.58; Figure 11.a).  \n\nThe number of bacterial OTUs primarily correlated with the 2\nnd\n\n PCA axis (0.64), \n\nwhich in turn was correlated with CPOM standing stock (0.46), NO3 (0.55) and NO2 \n\n(0.53). Therefore lower number of bacterial OTUS tended to occur in sites with high \n\nconcentrations of nitrates and nitrites, as well as with larger amounts of CPOM and lower \n\nconcentrations of phosphates dissolved in water (Figure 7; Annex 9). ANOSIM analysis \n\nsegregated bacterial communities among the three altitudes in the gradient (p = 0.54; \n\nglobal R\n \n= -0.021).  \n\n \n\nColorado \n\nBacterial species richness (in terms of OTUs) did not change significantly with \n\ntime and elevation (ANOVA; p = 0.13; F = 2.3; df = 3 by time and p = 0.12; F = 2.3; df = \n\n4 by altitude; Figure 10. b). However, when OTUs were pooled by elevation, it was clear a \n\nstrong decline with altitude (linear regression; p = 0.0004; R\n2 \n\n= 0.99; Figure 11.b).  \n\nThe variability of bacteria species richness in Colorado was strong and negatively \n\ncorrelated with the first PCA axis (r = -0.95; Annex 11). PCA analysis associated lower \n\nsites of the gradient (C1992 and C2212; high OTUs number), with high temperature and \n\nlow discharge. Additionally, those sites were positive related with higher concentrations \n\nof nitrates in water and CPOM. Low OTUs, number were associated with deeper streams \n\nand higher current velocity (Figure 8; Annex 12).  \n\nCommunity identity changed significantly among the three selected streams (p = \n\n0.003; global R\n \n= 0.51). Site C2798 was similar of C3200 and C1992 (ANOSIM; p = 0.11; \n\nglobal R = 0.27 between 3200 and 2798 and p = 0.06; global R\n \n= 0.41 between 2798 and \n\n1992), whereas the extreme sites of the gradient were statistically different (p = 0.03; \n\nglobal R= 0.76).  \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nLatitudinal comparisons \n\nWhen Ecuador and Colorado samples are jointly analyzed, the number of bacterial \n\ntaxonomical units (33 vs 32) were not significantly different (t test; p = 0.84; t = 0.21 df = \n\n8). MDS analysis (stress value: 0.19) depicted no significant difference between latitudes \n\n(ANOSIM; p = 0.41; global R= 0.008; Figure 9 and Annex 15). It means that both systems \n\nharbor similar bacterial species in the both studied systems, the tropical and the temperate \n\nlatitude. \n\n \n\n3.4 Discussion \n\n3.4.1 Aquatic fungi \n\nAltitudinal gradients \n\nHere I predicted a decrease in taxonomical units with increased elevation. \n\nHowever, this was not the case for aquatic fungi in Ecuador, where the number of OTUs \n\nincreased with altitude, whereas in Colorado higher number of OTUs peaked in \n\nintermediate sites.  \n\nIt is plausible that, besides (a) the increased daily temperature variation with \n\naltitude and (b) the island effect, other factors could be more important determining \n\ndiversity. The evidences from this study are that nutrients could be such factors.  \n\nMicrocosms experiments have shown that high levels of nutrients (nitrates and \n\nphosphates) allow the coexistence of a larger number of aquatic fungi species (Grattan and \n\nSuberkropp 2001; B\u00e4rlocher and Corkum 2003). In Ecuador, phosphorous in water \n\nincreased with elevation, and so the number of fungal taxonomical units, suggesting this \n\nnutrient could be controlling for fungal diversity. The importance of phosphorus to fungal \n\ngrowth was previously demonstrated in foregoing studies  (e.g. Suberkropp and Chauvet \n\n1995; Kavahagh 2005).  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nThe same could explain changes in OTUs numbers in Colorado, although with \n\nlesser intensity. Moderate concentrations of nitrates and high quantities of CPOM standing \n\nstock were associated with the increment of fungal OTUs number. The outlier of this \n\nrelationship is the lowest site (C1992) which exhibited the highest nitrate concentrations \n\n(50.9 \u00b5g/L) and the lowest number of taxonomical units (7). Some studies have \n\ndocumented that fungal diversity tend to increases at moderate eutotrophic conditions \n\n(Pascoal and C\u00e1ssio 2004; Sridhar et al. 2005; Ferreira et al. 2014). I do not know why the \n\nsite with highest nitrogen was the one with lower OTUs number. Potential explanations \n\ncould be limitation by other factors (e.g. P, not measured), or an unmeasured perturbation. \n\nThe role of aquatic fungi as main decomposers of particulate organic matter in \n\ntemperate streams has been widely recognized, as well as their association to the CPOM \n\n(Gulis and Suberkropp 2003; Krauss et al. 2011). The successful strategy to colonize a \n\nvariety of substrate consists in the ability to get attach to the detritus by their conidia \n\nshapes and penetrate the vegetative tissues with the hyphae to uptake nutrients during the \n\ngrowth stage of their life cycle (Wurzbacher et al. 1998). The strong correlation of higher \n\nfungal taxonomic units to higher quantities of CPOM standing stock found in Colorado \n\nstreams, suggests that nutrients may interact with substrate availability to explain fungal \n\ntaxonomic richness.  \n\nWhatever the explanations for the OTUs distribution along the altitudinal \n\ngradients, it is clear that, although temperature daily variation and biogeography could be \n\nimportant, other factors are more prominent.  \n\n \n\nCommunity composition along altitudinal gradients \n\nAssuming that the thermal tolerance range of the organisms would control the taxa \n\ndistribution along the altitudinal gradient, I was expecting to find higher fungal taxa \n\nturnover in Ecuador than in Colorado, because the organisms would tend to occupy \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nnarrow niches as a consequence of the temperature stability in the tropical regions. In \n\nEcuador, taxonomical dissimilarities (as a measurement of ? diversity) across sites were \n\nlower (i.e. higher similarity) than in Colorado, contrary to my expectations. The two \n\nhighest Colorado streams were very similar, whereas the lowest site harbored different \n\nfungal taxa.  \n\nThe most parsimonious explanation may be the geographic distance between the \n\nhighest and lowest sites in the gradients (shorter in Colorado). There should be also \n\nconsider that the Janzen proposal may not apply to aquatic fungi. Two reasons can be \n\ninvoked. Firstly, the thermal range in the water is lower than on land, with minimum \n\ntemperature never below 0\u00ba C and the maxima most likely never exceeding the 25\u00ba C (in \n\nthe studied area). Hence, temperature limitation is less important for stream organisms. \n\nSecondly, microorganisms may have a larger thermal tolerance than large size organisms. \n\nIf this is the case, then we should not expect differences in ? diversity between tempered \n\nand tropical streams.  \n\n \n\nLatitudinal comparisons in taxa numbers \n\nIf the temperature is the main environmental factor leading the variability of \n\nspecies richness between latitudes, higher number of fungal taxonomic units will be \n\nexpected in the tropical region, due to the narrow thermal tolerance of the organisms. \n\nHowever, Ecuador and Colorado had similar OTUs numbers. It has been proposed that \n\nhighest species diversity of freshwater fungi is localized in temperate regions, at middle \n\nlatitudes between 40-50\u00b0 (Shearer et al. 2006). It is possible that fungal decomposers \n\ndiversity do not follow the pervasive species richness gradient reported for the majority of \n\nthe eukaryotic species (Willig 2003), as has been reported in the meta-analysis conducted \n\nby Hillebrand (2004), in which this pattern becomes weaker as the organism size \n\ndecreases, an explanation fitting as well in the results discussed above.  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nThe currently results should be interpreted with caution, considering that diversity \n\nin Ecuador could be underestimated due to the earlier stage of decomposition compared \n\nwith Colorado, where the process was faster. For instance, in Ecuador by day 30 leaves \n\nalready lost 30% of their mass, whereas in Colorado they lost 50% of their mass. It is \n\nplausible that in a comparable stage of decomposition, leaves in Ecuador could harbor a \n\nlarger number of OTUs than the observed. Higher number of aquatic fungi recovered from \n\nsubmerged wood and identified by morphological techniques, was documented by Ho and \n\ncollaborators (2001) in tropical and subtropical streams than in temperate sites for the \n\nnorth and south hemisphere, suggesting that longer tracking time in the process is required \n\nfor future studies. \n\nThere were no differences in the number of taxa between Colorado and Ecuador, \n\nbut the overall fungal community analysis (Cluster) segregated Ecuador and Colorado \n\nsamples in two clades. This suggest that the two areas harbor unique fungal taxa, as has \n\nbeen reported on the literature for subtropical and temperate region (Ho et al. 2001).  \n\nSince this work assessed the ITS2 region that is common for fungi, the use of molecular \n\ntechniques allowed to identify that the fungal community composition in Ecuador an \n\nColorado were different, but further studies should be performed in order to determine the \n\ndifferent taxa identity focused in aquatic hyphomycetes. Given the methodology used, I \n\nwas unable to identify the species, but in a side experiment carried out in Ecuador, in \n\nwhich fragments of leaves recovered from the five streams studied in this work were \n\nincubated to obtain spores and then isolated, I observed the presence of Lunulospora \n\ncurvula (E2839), Clavatospora longibrachiata, (E3415), Tetrachaetum elegans, \n\nTetracladium marchalianum, Heliscus lugdunensis and Lemoniera spp. (E1805 and \n\nE1645; Annex 16). The occurrence of these aquatic hyphomycetes species have been \n\nreported for temperate streams (Duarte et al. 2006; Garnett et al. 2000), corroborating that \n\ntropical streams share some aquatic hyphomycetes with temperate latitudes. However, \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\ntropical systems may greatly differ from each other. For instance, Ferreira et al. (2012) \n\nrecord no colonization of litter by aquatic hyphomycetes. \n\nDifferences between Ecuador and Colorado in terms of fungi, could also been \n\nrelated with the litter substrate. Despite the nitrogen content was higher in A. acuminata \n\n(from Ecuador) than in A. incana (from Colorado; Table 7 chapter 1), which encourages a \n\nfaster colonization of aquatic fungi (Fellman et al. 2013), the toughness and lignin were \n\nhigher in the Ecuadorian species. Tough and lignin rich leaves are low quality substrate \n\nfor fungi (Ferreira and Chauvet 2011a).  Because of structural compounds (Andrew and \n\nHughes 2005) and polyphenolics tropical litter has been classified as poor quality (Ferreira \n\net al. 2012), which can constrain the number of fungal taxa in the tropics (Jabiol et al. \n\n2013) as well as it may be influencing the fungal taxa identity (B\u00e4rlocher 2005).  \n\nAnother factor that could explain fungal differences between Ecuador and \n\nColorado was water nutrient content. Nutrients were shown to be important controllers  of \n\nfungal taxa in previous studies (Ferreira and Chauvet 2011b). Nutrient concentrations \n\ndifferences observed in Ecuador and Colorado (0.4 \u00b5g/mL vs. 18.02 \u00b5g/mL; Table 5 \n\nchapter 1), may influence taxa numbers and taxa identity in those sites. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Bacteria \n\nAltitudinal gradients \n\nThe number of bacteria taxonomical units decreased along the altitudinal gradient \n\nin Ecuador and Colorado, as hypothesized. This result conforms with the predictions of \n\nthe Island Theory (MacArthur and Wilson 1963) and the temperature effect. Indeed, PCA \n\nanalysis in both areas related OTUs richness with bacterial OTUs numbers (higher at \n\nlower sites). Nevertheless, it is plausible that temperature was not the pivotal \n\nenvironmental variable leading this biological variability. Higher quantities of CPOM \n\nstanding stock and higher nitrates concentrations in water also influenced the diversity of \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nbacteria in lower sites at both gradients.  \n\nStudies have demonstrated that higher bacteria abundance and metabolic activity \n\nare positive correlated with larger surface areas of sediments and organic debris (Hargrave \n\n1972; Yamamoto and Lopez 1985). Since heterotrophic bacteria require substrates with \n\norganic compounds as source of energy (Molles 2010) and higher quantities of coarse \n\norganic matter in tropical and temperate streams were associated with higher number of \n\nbacteria taxa, is likely to infer that more availability of organic substrate in the sites \n\nenhanced the probability to colonize organic substrates such as leaves, resulting in higher \n\nnumber of bacteria OTUs. \n\nIn both, Ecuador and Colorado, PCA suggest a relationship between nitrogen and \n\nOTUs numbers. Nutrients may allow high production and therefore high numbers and \n\nhigh diversity. However, most likely ecosystems are co-limited by several factors. For \n\ninstance, Farjalla et al. (2002) observed that bacteria production is not stimulated by the \n\naddition of nitrogen in Amazonian freshwater ecosystems. \n\nAdditionally, the high number of OTUs recorded in the lower Ecuadorian  site \n\n(E1645) might be interpreted with caution, because the assessed V3 region within the \n\nbacterial 16 rDNA sequence is common for any bacteria taxa (Case et al. 2007), meaning \n\nthat the identification of OTUs is not selectively only for the bacteria associated with the \n\nlitter decomposition, which may overestimated the number of taxonomical units in the \n\nsite. Furthermore, higher number of fecal coliforms are apparently natural abundant in \n\ntropical systems (Boulton et al. 1998) and since the mentioned stream was near a farm, \n\nOTUs numbers may be responding to animal waste, which is consistent with higher \n\nconcentrations of nitrites at this site (Table 3 Chapter 1). \n\nIn summary, although different environmental variables can be controlling OTUs \n\nnumbers along the gradients in Ecuador and Colorado, results suggest that temperature \n\nmay be a prominent factor, followed by CPOM standing stock, and nitrogen. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nCommunity composition along altitudinal gradients \n\nIn Ecuador, OTUs similarity along the altitudinal gradient was high (i.e. low ? \n\ndiversity) whereas in Colorado the similarity was lower across sites, particularly the sites \n\nlocated at 2798 m and 3200 m, with lower similarity with the lowest site (1992 m). \n\nTherefore, ? diversity in Colorado was higher than in Ecuador.  \n\nThese results lesser the importance of temperature as a main environmental factor \n\ncontrolling bacterial species diversity, as expected if local organisms would be adapted to \n\noccupy narrow (Ecuador) or wide (Colorado) niches as a consequence of their thermal \n\ntolerance ranges (Janzen 1967).  \n\nThese results were consistent with the observed for fungi and the explanations \n\ncould be the same: (1) low thermal range of aquatic systems, (b) wide thermal tolerance \n\nfor microorganisms and (3) other factors may override temperature effects. Probably the \n\nmoderate levels of nitrates recorded in the stream C2798 offer more suitable conditions for \n\ndifferent taxa which are restricted only in the highest and the lowest sites, constrained by \n\nthe contrasting levels of nitrates (5.8 vs 50.9 \u00b5g/mL).  \n\n \n\nLatitudinal comparisons \n\nThe latitudinal gradient in species richness have been corroborated for larger and \n\nsmall organisms, such as planktonic marine bacteria and zooplankton (Fuhrman et al. \n\n2008). Notwithstanding, this study recorded similar quantities of freshwater bacteria taxa \n\nin the tropical and the temperate latitude, which is consistent with other studies indicating \n\nnull or weak latitudinal pattern (Hillebrand and Azovsky 2001; Hillebrand 2004; Fierer et \n\nal. 2007, 2011). The similarity on the taxa identity between Ecuador and Colorado streams \n\nstablished in this study, suggest that freshwater bacteria had a cosmopolitan distribution, \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nas has been documented in the literature for small size organisms. The most probable \n\nexplanation for the absence of differences between latitudes in terms of OTUs number and \n\ntaxa identity, might be due to the small organisms usually exhibit higher dispersal ability \n\nand may be less influenced by broader scale variables that regulates larger individuals \n\n(Hillebrand and Azovsky 2001; Hillebrand 2004; Fierer et al. 2007, 2011), making them \n\ncapable to colonize broader areas  and as consequence, diminishing spatial differentiation \n\nworldwide (Fuhrman et al. 2008). \n\n \n\nConclusive remarks \n\nThe present work reveals that biogeography of the aquatic fungi is highly \n\ninfluenced by the substrate type available (Alnus species) and by local factors such as \n\nnutrients dissolved in water (particularly phosphates in Ecuador). Because organisms at \n\nhigher latitudes, experienced wider variability of temperature during the year and \n\nincreasing their thermal tolerance ranges (Janzen 1967; Ghalambor et al. 2006), the \n\nspecies richness of fungi in the tropics was expected to be higher than the temperate \n\nregion. However, the same number of taxa richness in terms of OTUs was recorded for \n\nEcuador and Colorado. Given the temperature decreased with the elevation, the altitudinal \n\ngradient was expected to mirror the latitudinal gradient pattern described for larger \n\norganisms. Nevertheless, this trend was absent in this study for aquatic fungi along the \n\naltitudinal gradient. In Ecuador, the number of fungal taxa increased with the elevation \n\nand was strongly correlated with higher phosphates concentrations in water; whereas the \n\nmoderate levels of nitrates influenced the Gausian curve depicted in Colorado. \n\nOn the other hand, the high similarity of bacteria between the tropical and the \n\ntemperate latitude suggest that unicellular organisms display a cosmopolitan distribution. \n\nAs was hypothesized, the temperature at lower altitudes was consistence with the raise in \n\nthe number bacteria taxa in Ecuador and Colorado, despite this pattern was no find in a \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nbroader scale, in which the diversity was similar between latitudes. The PCA analysis \n\nrelated temperature with the number of bacteria OTUs in Ecuador and Colorado, but in the \n\nsame way the higher amounts of CPOM standing stock in the streams were highly \n\ncorrelated with this result.  \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, the latitudinal pattern of species richness for larger organisms was \n\nno corroborated for microbial decomposers assessed in this study (aquatic fungi and \n\nbacteria), confirming that small organisms had a null relationship with the large scale \n\npatterns as has been reported in the literature (Hillebrand and Azovsky 2001; Hillebrand \n\n2004) and rejecting the hypothesis that the latitude variability in temperature mirror the \n\naltitudinal gradient in species richness. The current results suggest that the number and the \n\ndistribution of fungal and bacteria taxa, as well as the community assemblage depends of \n\nlocal environmental variables more than broadly factors that apparently influenced larger \n\norganisms, which confirming that small size organisms do not follow the pervasive \n\nspecies richness trend (Fuhrman et al. 2008). The lower dissimilarities recorded in the \n\ntropical streams along the altitudinal gradient suggest that the distribution of \n\nmicroorganisms nether respond to the temperature influenced as the main factor. Given \n\nthat the thermal tolerance ranges were not measured specifically for representative species \n\nof bacteria and fungi in the studied sites, further research should be done in order to reveal \n\nthe influence of temperature in the microorganisms distribution and its consequently effect \n\nin the microbial decomposition on leaf litter in streams. \n\nTo confirm the results recorded in the current study future studies should assess \n\nlonger time of decomposition in the tropics, because earlier stages of the process might be \n\nunderestimate the diversity and influencing the temporal community composition of \n\ndecomposers. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n4. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n1. In Ecuador, the decrease of microbial decomposition rates with elevation and the \n\nrelationship between elevation and temperature strongly suggests that temperature is an \n\nimportant factor controlling litter decomposition. This was not the case for Colorado where \n\nfastest decomposition rate was attained at middle altitude. Litter decomposition was not \n\ncorrelated with temperature not with any of the measured variables. Further studies should \n\nbe carried out in order to elucidate the reasons for these results. The difference between \n\nColorado and Ecuador data could be related with nutrient availability. Since nitrates were \n\n~30 fold higher in Colorado than in Ecuador, it is plausible that nutrients override the \n\ntemperature effect on litter decomposition.  \n\n \n\n2. In terms of latitudinal comparisons, microbial decomposition rates were faster in \n\nColorado than in Ecuador. Two factors could explain this difference. (1) As mentioned \n\nabove, the higher nitrogen concentrations in Colorado than in Ecuador could be responsible \n\nfor faster decomposition in Colorado. (2)  Better quality if Colorado leaves (Alnus incana) \n\nthan leaves from Ecuador (A. acuminata), which were tougher and had higher \n\nconcentrations of polyphenolics. \n\n \n\n3. Contrary to my expectations, the number of fungal taxonomic units along altitudinal \n\ngradient in Ecuador increased with elevation, whereas in Colorado the number of OTUs \n\npeaked at middle altitudes. In Ecuador differences in OTUs can be explained by differences \n\nin phosphorus (which increases with altitude). In Colorado, there was not a clear \n\nrelationship between OTUs numbers and any of the environmental parameters, except \n\nmoderate concentrations of nitrates and higher quantities of CPOM standing stock.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n4. ? Diversity (measured as dissimilarity relationships across altitudinal gradients) was \n\nlower in Ecuador than in Colorado, suggesting that Janzen proposal (thermal tolerance \n\nrange of the organisms) may not apply to aquatic fungi.  The taxonomical units of aquatic \n\nfungi in the tropical and the temperate latitude were similar. These results suggest that \n\nmicrobial community structure, as well as the diversity, respond to small scale variations \n\nin the environment such as nutrients concentrations in water and leaf substrates, more than \n\nthe temperature. However, future research should assess the thermal tolerance of certain \n\nfungal species to corroborate that the temperature may not play a pivotal role constraining \n\nthe aquatic fungi distribution. \n\n \n\n5. As hypothesized, the number of bacteria taxonomical units decreased along the \n\naltitudinal gradient in Ecuador and Colorado. These results agree with the Island Theory if \n\nthe taxa identity differs in the upper sites and with the temperature effect on diversity. \n\nHowever, higher quantities of CPOM standing stock and higher nitrates concentrations in \n\nwater also influenced the diversity at lower sites at both gradients.  \n\n \n\n6. In terms of identity, contrary to my expectations, the similarity of bacteria taxa within \n\nEcuador was higher than in Colorado. This result lesser the importance of the temperature \n\nas the main environmental factor controlling the distribution of bacteria taxa, because it \n\nsuggest that bacteria in the tropical gradient occupy wider niches than in the temperate \n\nsystem. On the other hand, the number of bacteria OTUs and the identity of taxa between \n\nthe two latitudes were not statistical different, suggesting that the latitudinal pattern in \n\nspecies richness observed in large individuals cannot be applied for the small size \n\norganisms, probably because of its wider capability to colonize broader areas and lower \n\ntemperature variability in waters when compared with land systems. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n7. Future works should assess the importance of aquatic fungi and specifically of aquatic \n\nhyphomycetes in the microbial decomposition in the tropical streams, as has been well \n\nstablished for the temperate systems. It would be interesting to determine the identity of \n\naquatic hyphomycetes which are playing a pivotal role in the degradation of leaf litter in \n\ntropical streams combining morphological and molecular techniques, which can allow to \n\nidentify specially the active species during the process assessing the RNA expression. \n\nGiven that the structural compounds of the vegetative organic matter are degraded by the \n\nenzymatic activity, the quantification of the gene expression of certain enzymes such as \n\ncellulase or ligninase, could be tracked during the decomposition to understand this process \n\nat molecular level and linked with the identity of the taxa in the microbial community. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Protocol of Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.)  \n\n1. Place the sample into the PowerBead Tubes and gently vortex to mix it with the buffer contained in \n\nthe tube. It will helps to protect the nucleic acid from degradation and will begin to dissolve humic \n\nacid. \n\n2. Add 60 \u00b5l of Solution C1 that contains SDS and other disruption agents for the cell lysis. If the \n\nSolution C1 is precipitated, it must be heated to 60\u00b0 C until the SDS gets dissolved and it can be \n\nused while it is still warm \n\n3. Vortex the tubes in a horizontal flat-bed vortex pad (Mini-Tube Vortex) during 10 min to \n\nhomogenize the content inside the tube and to complete the cell lysis \n\n4. Centrifuge tubes at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds at room temperature \n\n5. Transfer the supernatant (around 450 \u00b5L) to a clean 2 mL collection tube and add 250 \u00b5L of \n\nSolution C2. This reagent contains a solution called Inhibitor Removal Technology (IRT) that \n\nprecipitates the inorganic and non DNA organic material such as humic substances, cell debris and \n\nproteins which could interfere in the subsequent DNA applications \n\n6. Vortex for 5 seconds and incubate the samples at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes \n\n7. Recovered around 500 \u00b5L of the supernatant to a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube avoiding the contact of \n\nthe pellet which contains the precipitated substances \n\n8. Add 200 \u00b5L of Solution C3 and invert the tubes. This solution is also an IRT reagent that \n\nprecipitates for second time the non-DNA organic substance as well as inorganic compounds. \n\n9. Incubate again the samples at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n10. Centrifuge the tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,00 x g \n\n11. Transfer around 650 \u00b5L of supernatant to a clean Eppendorf tube \n\n12. Add 1200 \u00b5L of Solution C4 to the supernatant and vortex 5 seconds to allow the DNA binding to \n\nthe membrane \n\n13. Load around 670 \u00b5L of the previous solution into the Spin Filter and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 \n\nminute at room temperature. Repeat this step three times until all the solution of each sample get \n\nprocessed \n\n14. To remove residual salts, humic acid and other contaminants the next step is going to wash the DNA  \n\n15. Add 500 \u00b5L of Solution C5 and centrifuge at room temperature for 30 seconds at 10,000 x g to \n\nremove residual salts from the DNA. \n\n16. Discard the flow and centrifuge again 1 minute under the same conditions above to complete the \n\nwash step using ethanol contained in the Solution C5 (wash solution) \n\n17. Place the Spin Filter in a clean 2 mL collection tube avoiding the contact with the wash solution \n\n18. Add 100 \u00b5L of Solution C6 in the center of the filter membrane to elude effectively the DNA from \n\nthe silica membrane. This solution contains 10 mM Tris which selectively released the DNA from \n\nthe membrane.  \n\n19.
