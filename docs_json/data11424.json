M. X-ray spectroscopy uncovering the effects of Cu and Fe based \nnanoparticles on Phaseolus vulgaris L. germination and seedling development. 2018.  \n88 p. Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o (Mestrado em Ci\u00eancias) \u2013 Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura, \nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Piracicaba, 2018. \n \n \nNanotechnology offers a great potential do design fertilizers with unique properties capable to \nboost the plant productivity. However, the nanoparticles environmental fate and their toxic \nresponses still need to be deeply investigated to their safe use. This study aims to investigate \nthe effect of copper oxide (nCuO) and magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) on the germination \nand seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Seeds were treated in nanoparticles \ndispersions in a wide range of concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg L-1) and incubated in a \ngermination chamber during 5 days. Different sized nCuO (25, 40 and&lt;80 nm) and \npolyethylene glycol (PEG) coated nFe3O4 were evaluated. Although both nCuO and nFe3O4 \ntreatments did not affected the germination rate, seedling weight gain was promoted by 40 nm \nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and inhibited by 1 000 mg Cu L-1 of 25 nm CuO and positive control \n(CuSO4). Among the tested nCuO, the higher chemical reactivity was found for the 25 nm \nCuO, and this may partially explain the observed deleterious effects. Seeds treated in nFe3O4-\nPEG at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 increased radicle elongation compared to the negative control (water), \nwhile Fe2+/Fe3+ (aq) (positive control) and bare nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1\n\n treatments reduced \nthe radicle of the seedlings. The growth promoted by the PEG-coated nanoparticles can be \njustified by the higher water uptake induced by the PEG, and also by its lower chemical \nreactivity compared to the bare nanoparticles. This was reinforced by enzymatic assays since \nnFe3O4-PEG treatment was also the least harmful to the ?-amylase activity. X-ray \nfluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) showed that most of the Cu and Fe incorporated by the \nseeds remained in the seed coat, specially in the hilum region, and X-ray tomography \nindicated that Fe3O4-PEG penetrated in this structure. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) \nunraveled that the Cu and Fe chemical environment of the nCuO and nFe3O4-PEG treated \nseeds persisted mostly in its primitive form. These results contribute to the understanding of \nhow nCuO, nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG interact with common bean seeds and seedlings and \nhighlights its potential use in seed priming. \n \nKeywords: Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Contudo, o destino \nambiental e os efeitos t\u00f3xicos das nanopart\u00edculas ainda necessitam ser profundamente \ninvestigados para o seu uso seguro. Este estudo visa investigar o efeito das nanopart\u00edculas de \n\u00f3xido de cobre (nCuO) e magnetita (nFe3O4) na germina\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvolvimento das pl\u00e2ntulas \nde Phaseolus vulgaris L. As sementes foram tratadas em dispers\u00f5es de nanopart\u00edculas em \ndiversas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg L-1) e incubadas em uma c\u00e2mara de \ngermina\u00e7\u00e3o durante 5 dias. Diferentes tamanhos de nCuO (25, 40 e&lt;80 nm) e nFe3O4 \nrecoberta com polietileno glicol (PEG) e foram avaliados. Embora ambos tratamentos de \nnCuO e nFe3O4 n\u00e3o afetaram a taxa de germina\u00e7\u00e3o, o ganho de massa das pl\u00e2ntulas foi \npromovido pela nCuO de 40 nm \u00e0 100 mg Cu L-1 e inibido pelos tratamentos de nCuO de 25 \nnm e controle positivo (CuSO4) \u00e0 1 000 mg Cu L-1. Dentre as nCuO testadas, a maior \nreatividade qu\u00edmica foi encontrada para a nCuO de 25 nm, e isso pode explicar parcialmente \nos efeitos delet\u00e9rios desta nanopart\u00edcula. Sementes tratadas com nFe3O4-PEG \u00e0 1 000 mg Fe \nL-1 aumentaram o alongamento das rad\u00edculas em compara\u00e7\u00e3o ao controle negativo (\u00e1gua), \nenquanto que os tratamentos Fe2+/Fe3+ (aq) (controle positivo) e nFe3O4 sem recobrimento \u00e0 1 \n000 mg Fe L-1 reduziram as rad\u00edculas das pl\u00e2ntulas. O crescimento promovido pelas \nnanopart\u00edculas recobertas com PEG pode ser justificado pela maior absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua induzido \npelo PEG, e tamb\u00e9m pela sua baixa reatividade qu\u00edmica comparada \u00e0s nanopart\u00edculas sem \nrecobrimento. Isso foi refor\u00e7ado por ensaios enzim\u00e1ticos uma vez que o tratamento de \nnFe3O4-PEG foi tamb\u00e9m o menos prejudicial \u00e0 atividade da ?-amilase. A espectroscopia de \nfluoresc\u00eancia de raios-X (XRF) mostrou que a maior parte do Cu e do Fe incorporados pelas \nsementes permaneceu no tegumento, especialmente na regi\u00e3o do hilo, e a tomografia de raios-\nX indicou que nFe3O4-PEG penetrou nesta estrutura. A espectroscopia de absor\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X \n(XAS) revelou que o ambiente qu\u00edmico do Cu e do Fe das sementes tratadas com nCuO e \nnFe3O4-PEG persistiram majoritariamente em sua forma primitiva. Estes resultados \ncontribuem para o entendimento de como nCuO, nFe3O4 e nFe3O4-PEG interagem com \nsementes de feij\u00e3o e destaca seu potencial uso no tratamento de sementes.  \n \nPalavras-chave: Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Namely, macronutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, \n\npotassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. Micronutrients comprise zinc, copper, iron, \n\nmanganese, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, and nickel.1 \n\nCopper (Cu) is an essential redox-active element required for several biochemical and \n\nphysiological process like photosynthesis, respiration, carbohydrate, lipid and nitrogen \n\nmetabolism, protection against oxidative stress and lignification of plant cell walls. It is a \n\ncofactor in many enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase.1; 2 Iron \n\n(Fe) is a cofactor in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and it is essential for the structure and \n\nfunction of the photosynthetic apparatus. It is an important constituent of enzymes involved in \n\nredox reactions like cytochromes and iron-sulfur proteins, and many others proteins \n\nparticipants of photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and respiration.1; 3; 4 \n\nTo improve the plant nutritional status fertilizers are commonly supplied through soil \n\nor foliar application. The former present some limitations since some soil properties can \n\ninterfere in element solubility and take up by plant roots.1 Whilst the latter needs higher leaf \n\narea index for absorption, several sprays sessions for macronutrients, caution when applying \n\nhigh concentrated nutrient solutions to avoid leaf damage and, besides that, fertilizer can be \n\nwashed out by rain.5 \n\nPriming seeds with nutrient-containing solutions is an attractive and easy alternative to \n\ncomplement these methods. Seed treatment requires few external inputs and low cost \n\ntechnologies. It is a simple and effective method of nutrient application.6 \n\nThe seed priming consists in exposing the seeds to a certain solution, or dispersion, for \n\na certain period. Meanwhile, the seed is partially hydrated but the radicle emergency does not \n\nhappen. Although the germination process does not occur, this moisture level triggers pre-\n\ngermination metabolic activity such as nucleic acid and protein synthesis and repair, that \n\ngenerally favor germination rate and seedling development.7 The major seed priming \n\ntechniques include hydropriming (seeds are soaked in water), osmopriming (osmotic solutions \n\nlike polyethylene glycol), halopriming (salt solutions such as CuSO4 and CaCl2) and solid \n\nmatrix priming (using solid carriers).8 \n\n\n\n12\t\n \u00a0\n\nIn general, the germination process is triphasic: phase I, or imbibition, is when the dry \n\nseed take up water and the metabolic activities are low, whereas during phase II, there is little \n\nwater uptake but intense metabolic activities. In phase III water content increases again \n\nconcomitantly with radicle emergence and growth.9 Regarding Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, the \n\nseed coat becomes wrinkled and the embryo starts to swell in the earlier hours of imbibition. \n\nAfter 48 and 72 hours, the radicle emerges and secondary roots are formed.10 \n\nIn the last ten years, many efforts have been devoted to investigate how agriculture \n\ncan be benefited by nanotechnology. A nanoparticle is typically defined as a material with a \n\ncharacteristic dimension from 1 to 100 nm.11 Due to their high surface area and nanoscale size, \n\nthey usually differ from their bulk counterparts presenting new chemical and/or physical \n\nproperties, such as mechanical strength,12 optical absorption or emission energy shifts,13 \n\nchemical reactivity,14 surface charges,15 magnetism,16 higher thermal conductivity17 and \n\nsolubility.18 Some of these features, as surface charges, solubility and chemical reactivity can \n\nbe suitable and desired to develop new fertilizers, including those targeted to seed treatment. \n\nStudies about seed priming with nanoparticles mostly observed beneficial and detrimental \n\neffects on seed germination and plant development, which may vary according to the plant \n\nspecies, tested material, nanoparticle size, time of exposure and applied concentration. Table \n\n1 shows that nanotechnology can enhance crops yield if such parameters are well established.  \n\nSeeds soaked in zinc oxide nanoparticles at 10 mg L-1 elongated roots of corn \n\nseedlings.19 Zinc (50-500 mg L-1) and silver (20 and 50 mg L-1) nanoparticles enhanced okra20 \n\nand pearl millet21 seeds germination, but decreased seedlings growth. Cucumber seeds \n\nexposed to copper oxide (100, 200, 400 and 600 mg L-1)22 and zinc oxide (10, 100 and 1 000 \n\nmg L-1)19 presented decreased root elongation. Although many reports showed that \n\nnanoparticles can positively or negatively affect seed germination and seedling development, \n\nthe mechanisms behind these phenomena are still poorly understood. \n\nAlong with the crop yield increase appeal, there are the health and environmental \n\nissues related to the possible negative effects that nanomaterials can bring.23 Nanoparticles \n\nreleased in the aquatic environment can be harmful to their organisms,24 in soil can be toxic \n\nfor earthworms25; 26 and beneficial rhizosphere bacteria27 which indirectly affect plants growth. \n\nOn the plant level, nanoparticles can induce genotoxicity,28; 29 alteration in nutritional status,30 \n\noxidative stress,29 and may result in decreased plant growth and biomass. \n\n \n\n\n\n13\t\n \u00a0\n\nTable 1 - Bibliographic survey of nanoparticle seed treatment.

Plant mineral analysis is commonly \n\ncarried out by means of spectroscopy techniques like inductively couple plasma mass \n\nspectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively couple plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) \n\nand electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ET-AAS). Each of them presenting their \n\nown advantages and limitations, but they all have in common the sample preparation step as a \n\nmandatory procedure. In this operation the sample matrix are destroyed by the digestion with \n\nstrong acids, which is laborious and time-consuming.    \n\nOn the other hand, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) requires minimum or none \n\nsample preparation. This non-destructive feature property makes it a very suitable technique \n\nfor plant analysis in vivo and even in situ, when acquired with handheld devices. Moreover, \n\nthe multielemental and simultaneous capability, high throughput and low cost features make it \n\neven more attractive.  \n\nThere are several variants of XRF systems. In the context of this dissertation, the use \n\nof benchtop energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and energy dispersive \n\nmicroprobe X-ray fluorescence (\u00b5-XRF) systems are highlighted. Besides providing quali-\n\nquantitative information, \u00b5-XRF is an important tool for seed studies because of its capability \n\nof elemental distribution mapping.38; 39 It can be useful to investigate the mineral distribution \n\nin seeds during its development,40 evaluate the elemental distribution between distinct \n\ngenotypes41 and patterns during germination.42 \n\nBesides XRF techniques, this dissertation also employed synchrotron-based X-ray \n\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS). XAS is widely used to determine the average local structural \n\nand chemical environment of an absorbing atom. In this method the X-ray beam scans the \n\nsample over a range of energies below and above the absorption edge of the element of \n\ninterest and a spectrum is created. The absorption edge refers to a sharp increase in the \n\nabsorption coefficient, which occurs when the core electron absorbs energy equal to or greater \n\nthan its binding energy. The energy region of the spectrum from the absorption edge to about \n\n50 eV above it is the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), which is used to \n\ndetermine the oxidation state, geometry and nature of ligands around the element of \n\ninterest.43; 44\t\n \u00a0\n\n  \n\n\n\n15\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nCommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most consumed food legume in the \n\nworld and is the major source of dietary protein in Latin America and Eastern Africa.45 \n\nBesides that, this seed was chosen as model species because it presents low dormancy, and it \n\nresults in a plant of small size and short cycle, which makes it easy to be employed in \n\nlaboratory studies.  \n\n \n\n1.1 Hypothesis \n\t\n \u00a0\n\nThis study raised the following hypothesis: \n\n\t\n \u00a0i) Nanoparticles (CuO and Fe3O4) can penetrate within the seeds; \n\nii) Nanoparticles can enhance seed germination and seedling growth; \n\niii) Nanoparticles can be biotransformed after seed soaking. \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\n \n\nThe general objective of this Masters dissertation was to assess the effect of copper \n\noxide (nCuO) and magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) on the germination and seedling \n\ndevelopment of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Thus, a series of experiments were designed to tests the \n\nabovementioned hypothesis. Seeds were treated in a wide range of concentrations. Different \n\nsized nCuO and coated nFe3O4 were evaluated. \n\nTo achieve the objectives, the biometric parameters germination rate and seedling \n\nweight gain were determined. XRF measured the Cu and Fe uptake and pointed out their \n\nstorage location. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the Cu and Fe chemical environment \n\nof the nCuO and nFe3O4 treated seeds, while X-ray tomography showed the 3D distribution of \n\nFe in the nFe3O4 treated seeds. Radicle elongation and ?-amylase activity were also recorded \n\nfor the nFe3O4 treated seedlings. \n\nA comprehensive nanoparticle characterization was accomplished through dynamic \n\nlight scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), EDXRF, scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM) for nCuO and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for nFe3O4. \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0  \n\n\n\n16\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.3 Structure of the dissertation \n\n \n\n This dissertation comprises an introductory text followed by two chapters.

Nevertheless, these unique \n\nproperties may also bring risks to the environment since the fate of nanoparticles is poorly \n\nunderstood. This study investigated the impact of a range of CuO nanoparticles sizes and \n\nconcentrations on the germination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. \n\nNanoparticles did not affect seed germination, but seedling weight gain was promoted by 40 \n\nnm CuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and inhibited by 1 000 mg Cu L-1 of 25 nm CuO and CuSO4. Most \n\nof the Cu taken up remained in the seed coat with Cu hotspots in the hilum. X-ray absorption \n\nspectroscopy unraveled that most of the Cu remained in its pristine form. The higher surface \n\nreactivity of the 25 nm CuO nanoparticles might be responsible for its deleterious effects. The \n\npresent study therefore highlights the importance of the nanoparticle structure for its \n\nphysiological impacts.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Phaseolus vulgaris L. CuO nanoparticle. Germination. X-ray based spectroscopy.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.1 Introduction  \n\nIn the past few years, a wide range of engineered nanoparticles, with unique \n\nphysicochemical properties, has been launched on the market and consequently to the \n\nenvironment. Such properties make these materials suitable for applications that  substantially \n\ndiffer from those of the usual bulk form. The nanoscale particle size of these materials \n\nincreases the surface to volume ratio, thus an important fraction of the atoms lies on  the \n\nsurface. These surface atoms have different properties that   those in bulk, thus affecting their \n\nsolubility, light scattering and absorbance, conductivity, melting point, and catalytic \n\nproperties.1 Being present also in many daily life goods, nanoparticles  can easily be released \n\ninto the environment and reach the entire  food chain. This possibility, which may result in \n\ntoxicological effects on consumers,2 remains so far uncertain and has been a  matter of intense \n\ndebate in recent years.   \n\nThe development of nanotechnologies tailored for agricultural purposes can result in a \n\nmore rational use of pesticides,  biocides, and fertilizers,3; 4 potentially reducing the usage of \n\nthese hazardous products in agricultural practices. Such innovations could lead to cost \n\nreduction, less nutrient leaching, and preservation of the desirable soil microbiota. In this \n\n context, we highlight the possibility of employing nanotechnology for seed coating.5 Seed \n\ncoating is an attractive  way for micronutrient delivery. It has the potential to improve \n\n seedling growth and crop productivity6 while treated seeds  generally germinate faster and \n\nmore synchronized than nontreated seeds.7 Compared to soil fertilization, seed treatment is an \n\neasier and cost-effective way requiring a lower quantity of nutrients.6 A significant yield \n\nincrease was observed when wheat seeds were treated with a low dose of Cu-EDTA  \n(0.04 kg ha-1).8  \n\nThe uptake of nanoparticles by plants occurs not only through the root system9 but \n\nalso via leaves10 and seeds.11 Studies regarding the effects of the interaction between \nnanoparticles and plants are not consensual. While some studies show that nano ZnO \n\npromoted root elongation in peanut12 and soybean,13 others showed similar results of nano \nCeO2 treatments on coriander,\n\n14 corn, and cucumber,15 while studies on tobacco16 and basil17 \n\nshowed detrimental effects on germination and growth upon exposure to nano TiO2.  \n\nThe effects of nanoparticle exposure do not only vary with the plant species, they also \n\ndepend on the chemical composition, reactivity, size, and morphology of the particles as well \n\nas on aggregation state, applied concentration, and experimental conditions. Inside living cells, \n\n\n\n23\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nthey can influence crucial processes like oxidative balance, genomic, proteomic, and \n\nmetabolomic. The nanoparticles can be  internalized by endocytosis, and depending on their \n\nnature,  can be located in different types of organelles. The entrance is controlled by \n\nbiological and physicochemical attributes such as  the cell type, surface chemistry and charge, \n\nsize, shape, and  mechanical properties of the nanoparticles.18  \n\nSpecifically regarding the interaction between nanoparticles and seeds, the literature is \n\nstill scarce. Depending on nanoparticle size, composition, and  concentration, germination and \n\nroot elongation can be either favored or reduced. Studies on Cu-based nanoparticles are even \n\n scarcer.   \n\nNanometric copper is broadly used in catalysts, coatings,  electronic components, \n\nmedicines, and lubricant compounds.19 It means that regardless of their potential application \n\nfor seed  treatment, copper-based nanoparticles will ultimately reach the  environment and \n\nend up interacting with plants. Therefore, we  must investigate and understand how these \n\nnanoparticles affect  seed germination and seedling development. Albeit found only  as a trace \n\nelement in many plant tissues, copper is considered  essential for vegetal life, being a \n\ntransition metal involved in  several metabolic processes like photosynthesis, mitochondrial \n\nrespiration, oxidative stress protection, and protein synthesis.20 Nonetheless, most reports in \n\nthe literature show an increased  toxicity in plants exposed to copper nanoparticles. \n\nThese reports emphasize an inhibitory effect on seedling growth in  different species such as \n\nblack mustard,21 green peas,22 mung  beans, and wheat.11  \n\nThe present study aimed at investigating the effect of commercial Cu-based \n\nnanoparticles, used for seed priming, on  the germination and seedling development of \n\nPhaseolus vulgaris, also known as common bean or kidney bean. In order to verify their \n\npotential use as seed fertilizer and the possible high doses  impairments, we evaluated the \n\nimpact of three nanoparticle sizes (25, 40, and&lt;80 nm) at four concentrations (1, 10, 100 and \n\n1000 mg Cu L-1). Besides monitoring biometric parameters such as germination rate and \n\nseedling weight gain,  a comprehensive characterization was carried out using X-\n\nray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) seeking to trace the Cu \n\nuptake, storage location, and  biotransformation.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n24\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.2 Materials and Methods \n\n2.2.1 Characterization of pristine CuO nanoparticles and dispersions \n\nCopper oxide and passivated CuO nanoparticles (herein all  referred as nCuO) were \n\npurchased from US Nanomaterials Research  Inc. (USA), in three different sizes: 25, 40, and \n\n<80 nm. Copper sulfate (CuSO4\u00b75H2O) was purchased from MERCK KGaA (Germany) \n\nand used as a copper ionic reference treatment.  \n\nThe purity of each nCuO was determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence \n\nspectroscopy (EDXRF; EDX-720 Shimadzu, Japan). Two hundred milligrams of pristine \n\npowders were weighted in a 6.3 mm aperture X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) sample \n\ncup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with a 5 \u00b5m thick polypropylene film (no. 3520 - \n\nSpex Ind. Inc., USA). The samples were analyzed under vacuum, in triplicate, using a \n\nrhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable current adjusted for a detector deadtime \n\nbelow 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing \n\na Si (Li) detector for 300 s. The quantification was carried out using the fundamental \n\nparameters method.  \n\nThe crystal structure of the nCuO was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) \n\nemploying a PW 1877 diffractometer (Philips,  The Netherlands) with Cu?K? radiation. \n\nUsing the peak width it was possible to estimate the crystallite size by the Scherrer equation:  \n\nD(hkl) = K? / ?cos? \n\nwhere D is the mean crystal size of the nanoparticles, K the Scherrer constant (0.94 for \n\nspherical crystals with cubic symmetry ), ? the wavelength of light used for the diffraction \n\n(0.154184 nm to Cu), ? the full width at half maximum of the peak, and ? refers to the angle \n\nmeasured. \n\nNanoparticle morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; \n\nInspect F50, FEI Company, ?USA) at the Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory \n\n(LNNano, Campinas, Brazil). The CuO nanoparticles were suspended in deionized water and \n\ndispersed using an ultrasonic processor (model 705 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific, \n\nUSA) under 50% amplitude for 8 min at 1, 10, 100, and 1 000 mg Cu L-1. The hydrodynamic \n\nsize and the zeta potential were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Zetasizer Nano, \n\nMalvern Instruments, U.K.) at the Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory (LNBio, \n\nCampinas, Brazil). \n\n\n\n25\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.2.2 Germination assay  \n\nPhaseolus vulgaris seeds, variety BRS Cometa, were supplied by the Brazilian \n\nAgricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), having an average germination rate of 88%.  \n\nSeeds were first immersed in a 10% NaClO solution under stirring for 10 s for \n\ndisinfection, followed by rinsing with deionized water. Subsequently, 20 seeds were soaked \n\nfor 20 min in the appropriate concentration of each nCuO size. CuSO4\u00b75H2O solutions at the \n\nsame concentrations were used as a positive control, whereas deionized water was used as a \n\nnegative control. After the exposure, the seeds were placed on a 15 cm paper filter fit on the \n\nbottom of a Petri dish, and 8 mL of the soaking solution was added for moisturizing the paper \n\nfilter. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company Inc., USA), inserted \n\ninto a plastic bag for preventing water loss, and finally incubated in a germination chamber \n\n(TE-4020, Tecnal, BR) under dark and ventilation at 27 \u00b0C for 5 days. The experiment was \n\nconducted in quadruplicate per treatment. \n\nThe number of germinated seeds was counted daily to determine the rate of \n\ngermination. After 5 days, the assay was completed. Fresh mass was measured and the \n\ngerminated seeds were rinsed in deionized water to remove the surface-bound metal or nano \n\nmetal oxide and then dried in a laboratory oven (515/4A, FANEM, Brazil) at 60 \u00b0C for 2 days \n\nto obtain the dry mass.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Copper uptake quantification  \n\nDried seedlings were carefully separated in two fractions: seedling and seed coat. One \n\ngram of each component was weighted in a previously decontaminated porcelain crucible and \n\nthen digested by dry ashing method using a muffle furnace (F-2, Fornitec, Brazil) at 100 \u00b0C h-\n\n1 ramp rate up to 550 \u00b0C and ashed for 14 h. Each dry ashing digestion batch included a blank \n\nfor ensuring no contamination. The ashes were dissolved in 5 mL of 1 M HNO3(aq), and 950 \n\n\u00b5L of this solution was transferred into a 1.5 mL vial and 50 \u00b5L of 1 000 mg Ga L-1 was \n\nadded as an internal standard. Then, the sample was homogenized using a tube shaker vortex \n\n(MA162, Marconi, Brazil). \n\nThe Cu content of the digested samples was determined by EDXRF. Fifteen milliliters \n\nof the digests were pipetted into the external side window of the 6.3 mm aperture XRF sample \n\ncup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with 5 \u00b5m thickness polypropylene film  \n\n(no. 3520 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) and dried at 60\u00b0C in a laboratory oven. This procedure was \n\n\n\n26\t\n \u00a0\n\ncarried out twice. The samples were analyzed in triplicate using a rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at \n\n50 kV and auto-tunable current with a deadtime at 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray \n\nspectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing a Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The quantification \n\nwas performed using external standard calibration. The recovery of this method was assessed \n\nspiking the sample with 1 000 mg Cu L-1 before the dry ashing step.  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 nCuO solubility \n\nTo verify the Cu solubility of each nCuO powder, 50 mL of nCuO aqueous \n\ndispersions were prepared at 100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1 using a probe ultrasonic device  \n\n(Fisher Scientific\u2122 Model 705 Sonic Dismembrator). The equipment was operated at 95 W \n\n(amplitude of 50 %) and 50 J, during 4 x 5 min with an interval of 3 min between each cycle. \n\nAfter 24 hours, one milliliter of each dispersion was transferred to Eppendorf\u2122 vials  \n\nand then centrifuged by a microcentrifuge (Mikro 120, Hettich, Germany) for 60 minutes at \n\n13 000 rpm.  \n\nQuantitative analysis of the supernatants was performed by EDXRF using Ga as \n\ninternal standard. The analysis parameters and experimental setup were the same as above \n\nmentioned (copper uptake quantification).   \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Mapping the Cu accumulation spots  \n\nThe seeds were exposed to 25 and 80 nm nCuO dispersions at 1 000 mg Cu L-1 and  \n\n40 nm nCuO at 5 000 mg Cu L-1 for 20 min, dried at room temperature, and gently cut in the \n\nmiddle using a stainless steel blade. Subsequently, the seed was placed in a sample holder \n\nwith a poly(amide) tape and the cotyledon\u2019s inner side exposed for analysis. Chemical images \n\nof the primary root were also recorded at the third, fourth, and fifth day germination. For the \n\nlatter measurements, the same germination assay procedure was followed, but only the higher \n\nnCuO concentration (1 000 mg Cu L-1) treatment and copper sulfate (positive control) were \n\nanalyzed, except for the 40 nm nCuO treatment which seeds were soaked in 100 mg Cu L-1.  \n\nThe microanalysis was carried out using benchtop microprobe X-ray fluorescence \n\nsystem (Orbis PC EDAX, USA) operating with a Rh X-ray tube at 40 kV and 300 \u00b5A.  \n\nThe sample was interrogated with a 30 \u00b5m X-ray beam spot size provided by a polycapillary \n\noptic. The detection was carried out by a 30 mm2 silicon drift detector (140 eV FWHM at the \n\n5.9 keV Mn-K? line) with a deadtime of nearly 3%. Seed maps were registered using a matrix \n\n\n\n27\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nof 64x50 points (number of analyzed points on xy-axes) and dwell time per pixel of 1 s. For \n\nthe primary roots, a matrix of 32x25 points and 500 \u00b5s of dwell time were selected. \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Copper chemical speciation analysis  \n\nSample preparation for determining copper speciation by micro-X-ray absorption \n\nnear-edge structure (\u00b5-XANES) analysis was the same as used for \u00b5-XRF analysis, but the \n\nseeds only received the 1 000 mg Cu L-1 dispersion treatment. After drying, the samples were \n\nstored in sealed Petri dishes 10 days prior analysis. The analysis was accomplished using \u00b5-\n\nXANES at the D09B-XRF beamline at the 1.37 GeV Brazilian Synchrotron  Light Laboratory \n\n(LNLS, Campinas, Brazil).  \n\nAt XRF beamline, synchrotron radiation was generated by a  bending-magnet and \n\ncollimated by slits. The monochromatic beam was produced by a Si(111) crystal and a KB \n\nmirror system was used to focus it to the 20 \u00b5m diameter spot size. The \u00b5-XANES spectra \n\nwere recorded in fluorescence mode using a silicon drift detector (SDD; AXAS-A,  KETEK \n\nGmbH, Germany). The energy was calibrated utilizing a  reference Cu foil.   \n\nThe chemical maps, previously provided by \u00b5-XRF analysis, aided selecting the \n\nproper seed region for \u00b5-XANES analysis according to the Cu accumulation spots after the \n\nnCuO exposure. The \u00b5-XRF maps identified three different regions for speciation studies: \n\noutside seed coat, within seed coat, and cotyledon near seed coat.  \n\nIn order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, five XANES spectra were recorded and \n\nmerged in each sample region. Sixteen reference Cu compounds were previously synthesized \n\nin our laboratory according to Sarret et al.23 and measured for providing the model spectra. \n\nThe \u00b5-XANES spectra were normalized and subjected to linear combination fitting (LCF) \n\nanalysis using the Athena software of the IFEFFIT package.24 The uncertainties stated for the \n\nweighted  compounds correspond to 1? standard errors.   \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Root microscopic analysis \n\nTo determine the exact tissue of Cu accumulation in root samples, seedlings were \n\ncleared in a solution of 2.5% commercial bleach in deionized water for 24 h and rinsed \n\nin deionized water five times. Roots were cut from the rest of the seedling  and mounted on \n\nglass slides with 50% glycerol. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioVert 35 microscope \n\ncoupled with a Zeiss AxioCam ICc 3  digital camera in brightfield conditions.   \n\n\n\n28\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.2.8 Surface reactivity of CuO nanoparticles \n\nThe reactivity of the  CuO nanoparticles was evaluated measuring its ability to \n\ndecompose  H2O2 through a Fenton-like reaction.\n25 In a 25 mL round-bottom reaction flask, \n\n19.5 mL of a 1 000 mg Cu L-1 aqueous dispersion of the tested nanoparticle was magnetically \n\nstirred. The flask was connected to a 25 mL graduated pipet through a silicone tube. The pipet \n\nwas immersed in a measuring cylinder water column. Then, 0.5 mL of 30% v/v H2O2 solution \n\nwas inserted in the reaction flask with a syringe. The volume of the produced O2 was \n\nmonitored by following the shift of a water column in a pipet. The procedure was carried out \n\ntwice. In addition to the CuO nanoparticles, also the O2 evolution by CuSO4 was determined. \n\n \n\n2.2.9 Statistical analysis  \n\nThe number of germinated seeds and the weight data were submitted to analysis of \n\nvariance (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s multiple range tests at 95% confidence interval using the \n\nAction Stat software (version 3.3.111.1178, Estatcamp, BR). \n\n \n\n2.3 Results and Discussion  \n\n2.3.1 Characterization of the nanoparticles and dispersions  \n\nThe purity of the nanoparticles as evaluated by EDXRF was above 99.6% for all \n\nnanoparticles (Table 2.1). The contaminants found were Cr, Ca, and Sn and their \n\nconcentrations ranged from hundreds to thousands mg kg-1. XRD patterns, presented in Figure \n\n2.1, showed that crystalline phases present in the 40 and 80 nm particles corresponded to CuO \n\nin the monoclinic phase. For the 25 nm particles, besides the standard diffraction peaks \n\nattributed to CuO the XRD pattern also revealed the presence of face centered cubic metallic \n\nCu as informed by the supplier. The crystallite size in the direction of the plane 111 of the \n\noxidic phase was 3.91, 23, and 21 nm for the 25, 40, and 80 nm CuO nanoparticles, \n\nrespectively. The crystallite size in the 111 direction for the metallic fraction of the 25 nm \n\nparticles was 5.21 nm (see Table 2.2). The particle sizes measured by SEM were in agreement \n\nwith those reported by the supplier (Figure 2.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n29\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nTable 2.1 - Degree of purity of each nCuO used in this study and concentrations of contaminants \nfound \n\nCuO size \n(nm) \n\nPurity \n(%) Contaminants (mg kg\n\n-1) \n\n  Cr Ca Sn \n\n25 100% --- --- --- \n\n40 >99.9% 418 --- --- \n\n<80 >99.6% --- 1764 2095 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - XRD patterns for 25, 40 and&lt;80 nm nCuO.

These nanoparticles were dispersed without any \n\nsurfactants, and primary particle agglomeration was observed with average hydrodynamic \n\ndiameters of 428, 180, and 273 nm for 25, 40, and 80 nm nCuO, respectively. Measurements \n\nshowed that these particles presented negative zeta-potentials regardless the size, with values \n\nof ?21 \u00b1 5, ?15 \u00b1 6, and ?25 \u00b1 7 mV for 25, 40, and 80 nm nCuO, respectively. The literature \n\nreported similar  values for 20?200 nm nCuO water dispersions, for which a hydrodynamic \n\ndiameter of 480 nm and a zeta potential of ?21  \u00b1 2 mV were found.26   \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 - Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of the nCuO (25, 40 and 80 nm) dispersions \ndetermined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) \n\nNominal size (nm) Zeta-potential (mV) \nHydrodynamic diameter (nm) \n\nPeak 1 Peak 2 \n\n25 -21 \u00b1 5 428 (98.1%) 5 477 (1.9%) \n\n40 -15 \u00b1 6 180 (100%) --- \n\n80 -25 \u00b1 7 273 (100%) --- \n\n \n\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements for the pristine 25 nm nCuO \n\nshowed that this nanoparticle contained  metallic Cu, Cu2O, and CuO, as shown in Figure 2.3. \n\nThe linear  combination analysis of the XANES spectra revealed the  following proportion: \n\nCuO (65 \u00b1 2%), Cu2O (18 \u00b1 4%), and  Cu (17 \u00b1 10%). The XRD input and XAS analysis \n\n\n\n31\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nallowed us  to conclude that the structure of the 25 nm nCuO consisted of  a metallic core \n\nmade of Cu covered by oxidized layers of Cu2O  and CuO. Therefore, the results obtained for \n\nthe 25 nm nCuO  may not only be a consequence of their size but may also be  influenced by \n\nthe chemical composition of its core. One should keep in mind that the core properties can \n\naffect the surface of  the material.   \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Linear combination fit for Cu-K edge XAS spectra recorded for the 25 nm CuO based \nnanomaterial. The 25 nm CuO nanoparticle was a mixture of CuO (65 \u00b1 2 %), Cu2O (18 \u00b1 4%) and Cu \n(17 \u00b1 10%) R-factor= 0.31%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Effects of nCuO on seed germination and seedling growth \n\nFigure 2.4 shows the root development on the fifth day  after the seeds were exposed \n\nto the Cu treatments. Qualitative measurements of growth parameters pointed out that 1 and \n\n10 mg Cu L-1 nCuO promoted root elongation in comparison to  the water control. Root \n\nelongation inhibition was noticed from 100 mg Cu L-1 nCuO upward. The only exception was \n\nthe 100 mg Cu L-1 treatment with 40 nm nCuO that did not affect root  elongation.   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.4 - Morphological characteristics of germinated P. vulgaris seeds soaked in (a) 25 nm, (b) 40 \nnm, (c)&lt;80 nm CuO nanoparticles, and (d) CuSO4. Concentrations of the treatments varied from 1 to \n1 000 mg Cu L-1 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 presents both (a) germination rate and (b) fresh  mass gain on 5th day after \n\ngermination. For the water control, the  average germination rate was 80%. All the nCuO \n\ntreated seeds  had higher or comparable values compared to the negative  control, except for \n\nthe 40 nm nCuO treatment at 1 mg Cu L-1 that had only 70% germination. The highest and the \n\nlowest germination rates were found for the CuSO4 treatments at 100 (92.5%) and 1 000 mg \n\nCu L-1 (65%), respectively.  \n\nFigure 2.5b displays the fresh weight gain in a 2D plot as a function of the \n\nconcentration of Cu in the dispersion and particle size. For the negative control (water), we \n\nconsidered  zero entry values for particle size and concentration. For the  positive control \n\n(CuSO4), we considered a size of 0.8 nm based  on the diameter of CuSO4 molecule\n27 and the \n\nseveral  concentrations employed in the test.  \n\nThe 2D plot interpolates sizes and concentrations revealing the trends between \n\nthe actual tested points. Figure 2.5b shows that on the fifth day of the  germination assay, \n\nsome treatments tended to promote fresh  mass gain (reddish areas) whereas others tended to \n\nprevent it  (bluish areas). Seeds exposed to 80 and 40 nm nCuO at 1 and 100 mg Cu L-1, \n\nrespectively, had the highest mass gain. The 25 nm CuO nanoparticles were deleterious at 100 \n\nand 1 000 mg  Cu L-1, while the&lt;80 nm nCuO and CuSO4 reduced seedling  development at \n\n\n\n33\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n1 000 mg Cu L-1. The difference between the  higher and lower mass gain was statistically \n\nsignificant according to the Tukey test (p &lt;0.05). Figure 2.6 shows that  low concentrations \n\nand higher particle size improved mass gain whereas higher concentrations regardless of the \n\nparticle size,  including CuSO4, reduced the mass gain. A similar trend was  found for the dry \n\nmass (data not shown here).   \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - (a) Germination rate and (b) fresh mass gain of P. vulgaris seeds exposed to 25, 40,&lt;80 \nnm CuO nanoparticles, CuSO4 (1?1 000 mg Cu L\n\n-1), and H2O (control) after 5 days of germination \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Weight gain of P. vulgaris seeds as function of the concentration of nCuO and CuSO4 (in \nmg Cu L-1).

As discussed below, the copper nanoparticles were \n\nreactive (in terms of H2O2 decomposition), it is currently known that radicals may also act as \n\nsingling molecule and therefore, under certain conditions, they could promote the \n\ngermination.31  \n\nContrary to our findings, low doses of&lt;50 nm CuO nanoparticles decreased the \n\ngermination of rice (Oryza sativa L.); the concentrations used were 0.5?1.5 mM (39.8 to \n\n119.3 mg L-1). Root mass and length were equally affected under nCuO stress. Copper \n\nstressed roots showed loss of viable cells as established by Evans blue staining.32 In green \n\npeas (Pisum sativum L.), mass gain was also impaired at higher nCuO  concentrations (from \n\n100 to 500 mg L-1). An increase in  reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and gene \n\nexpression  in the roots were found.22 Lower concentrations (10 and 20 mg  L-1) of 20?30 nm \n\nnCuO reduced the root length and mass  gain of lettuce (Lactuca sativa), accompanied by \n\nincreased  catalase activity and decreased ascorbate peroxidase activity.33   \n\nThus, in addition to our results that showed that dose and  type of nanoparticles play a \n\nrole in the seed germination and  growth effects, the literature indicated that the effects may \n\nalso  vary from one plant species to another.   \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Determination of Cu uptake by Phaseolus vulgaris  seeds  \n\nTo determine the Cu content of seedlings exposed to nCuO, CuSO4, and water by \n\nEDXRF, the seed coat was removed to enable separate analysis of the seedling and respective \n\nseed coat (Figure 2.8).  \n\nFigure 2.8 - Seed coat and seedling of a common bean.

Copper was much more concentrated in the \n\nexternal than in the inner part of the seeds. It means that the seed coat was an effective barrier \n\nfor nCuO absorption, but this was less evident for CuSO4. In the case of  ZnO nanoparticles, \n\nZn uptake by the endosperm of corn without seed coat during germination was about six \n\ntimes higher than in the whole grain.34  \n\nDeionized water treatment (negative control) gave concentrations of 14.8 \u00b1 0.5 mg Cu \n\nkg-1 in the seedling and 8.2 \u00b1 1.6 mg Cu kg-1 in the seed coat. Concentrations close to the \n\nnegative control were observed for the seeds exposed to nCuO at 1 and 10 mg Cu L-1, \n\nsuggesting that at these concentrations Cu hardly managed to enter and cross the seed coat. \n\nThe concentration of Cu incorporated by the seeds sharply rose at nCuO exposure levels of \n\n100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1. Compared to the other two nanoparticles sizes, the 40 nm nCuO \n\nseemed to be less incorporated by the seeds.  \n\nA linear correlation was found between the content of Cu taken up by the seed \n\ncoat/seedling and the concentration of CuSO4 solution used for seed priming. Both adjusts \n\n(not shown here) gave Pearson\u2019s r > 0.98. The slope for the relationship between Cu \n\nconcentration in the embryo and exposure concentration (Figure 2.9a) was 11.2 times lower \n\nthan that found for the seed coat (Figure 2.9b).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Copper concentrations in the (a) seedling and (b) seed coat of germinated common bean \nseeds treated with 25, 40,&lt;80 nm CuO nanoparticles, CuSO4 (1?1 000 mg Cu L\n\n-1) and H2O (control)  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nCu solubility tests were carried out to evaluate the fraction of soluble Cu ions released \n\nby the nCuO. They indicated that the smaller the nCuO size, the greater the solubility  \n\n(Figure 2.10). At 100 mg Cu L-1, the supernatant fraction of the 25 nm nCuO dispersion \n\ncontained 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 mg Cu L-1 compared with 0.18 \u00b1 0.01 mg Cu L-1 for the 80 nm nCuO \n\ndispersion. Such low concentrations in solution suggest that Cu incorporated by the seedling \n\ncorresponded mainly to dispersed nCuO rather than only to ionic Cu in solution. For \n\ncucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L.), which seeds were exposed to ZnO nanoparticles, \n\nthe Zn content was significantly correlated with the soluble Zn found in the solution, which \n\nindicates that cucumber seeds uptake Zn mainly in the soluble form.34  \n\nExposure to the 80 nm nCuO led to concentrations of 40 \u00b1 9 and 1 500 \u00b1 400 mg Cu \n\nkg-1 in the embryo and seed coat, respectively. Different from the 25 nm nCuO, no effect on \n\ngermination or weight was found for 80 nm nCuO at 1 000 mg Cu L-1. These results suggest \n\nthat these latter nanoparticles may be used in seed priming when it is aimed at overcoming Cu \n\ndeficiency.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - Cu soluble fraction in the supernatant of nCuO (25, 40 and 80 nm) dispersions and \nCuSO4 solution  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0  \n\n25\n n\n\nm\n \n\n25\n n\n\nm\n \n\n40\n n\n\nm\n \n\n40\n n\n\nm\n\n80\n n\n\nm\n \n\n80\n n\n\nm\n \n\nCu\nSO\n\n4\n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n200\n400\n600\n800\n\n1000\n 1000 mg L-1\n\n 100 mg L-1\n\nC\non\n\nce\nnt\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \nof\n\n C\nu \n\n(m\ng \n\nL-\n1 )\n\nSize (nm)\n\n\n\n38\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.3.4 Spatial distribution of Cu in the soaked seeds  \n\n\u00b5-XRF is a nondestructive microanalytical method that allows evaluating the spatial \n\ndistribution of elements in for instance biological tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is \n\nthe first \u00b5-XRF mapping of treated seeds. This technique has been commonly used to \n\ninvestigate the allocation of elements in nontreated seeds like wheat,35 rice,36 soybean,37 and \n\nArabidopsis thaliana.38 However, most of these studies employed synchrotron X-ray sources. \n\nHere we show results acquired using an X-ray tube excitation laboratory benchtop facility that \n\nuncovered the pattern of distribution of Cu in the nCuO and CuSO4 exposed bean seeds.  \n\nFigure 2.11 shows the mapped area of the seed and the corresponding Cu chemical \n\nimage for a seed soaked in CuSO4 (a) nCuO 25 nm (b) and nCuO 40 nm (c). The images were \n\nrecorded 24 h after the soaking and prior to seed germination. The \u00b5-XRF maps confirmed the \n\nEDXRF results (shown above) that the Cu was mostly concentrated in the seed coat but also \n\nrevealed the presence of Cu hotspots in the hilum region.   \n\nTo be absorbed by the seeds, the water-dispersed nanoparticle must cross the seed coat \n\n(or testa). This structure is composed by a layer of sclerenchyma cells, similar to the palisade \n\ncells, with a thick cell wall. Below this layer, there is another layer characterized by smaller \n\ncells and finally a parenchyma composed of elongated outer cells and smaller internal cells \n\nwith irregular or branched shapes. Common beans have a hilum associated with the seed coat, \n\nwhich is a scar left by the funiculus, the structure that connects the seed to the placenta. Just \n\nbelow the hilum there is the micropyle, a small pore that allows water uptake into the seed.39 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n39\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.11 - Pictures and \u00b5-XRF chemical maps for Cu in common bean seeds exposed to (a) CuSO4 \nat 1 000 mg Cu L-1, (b) nCuO 25 nm at 1000 mg Cu L-1, and (c) nCuO 40 nm at 5 000 mg Cu L-1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe chemical images also revealed the existence of a concentration gradient from the \n\nouter to the inner region of the seed. This indicates that movement of Cu is driven by the \n\nhigher chemical potential of the nCuO dispersion or CuSO4 solution. Since the seed coat is \n\nnot a homogeneous structure, the nCuO particles or Cu ions may find preferential channels, \n\nsuch as through the micropyle.  \n\nDifferently from the EDXRF assessment, which gave the average concentrations of \n\nCu in the seedling (comprising the storage tissue and emerging root) (Figure 2.9a), the spatial \n\nresolution provided by the 30 \u00b5m X-ray beam shows that Cu is concentrated in a small \n\nfraction of the embryo. Therefore, although Cu is not well distributed along the seedling \n\ntissue, its presence in very specific regions of the tissue was sufficient to affect seedling \n\nweight gain at 1 000 mg Cu L-1. \n\n  \n\n\n\n40\t\n \u00a0\n\nBecause of its high solubility, Cu from the CuSO4 treatment was more prone to be \n\nabsorbed than from the nCuO treatment. This indicates that Cu transport through the seed \n\noccurs by diffusion, since the transport of Cu ions is much faster and easier than that of \n\nnanoparticles. \n\n \n\n2.3.5 Chemical speciation of the incorporated Cu  \n\nOnce Cu accumulation spots were located, we determined its chemical form using \n\nXAS, which is a nondestructive tool. Figure 2.12a shows the spots measured in the treated \n\nseeds. Figure 2.12b?d  shows the spectra recorded in the outside, seed coat, embryo,  radicle, \n\nand pristine nanoparticles used to produce the 1 000 mg Cu L-1 dispersions. Figure 2.12b \n\npresents data for treatments with 25 nm nCuO, Figure 2.12c for 40 nm nCuO and Figure \n\n2.12d for 80 nm nCuO.   \n\nFigure 2.12b indicates that the chemical environment on the  outside of the seed coat, \n\nin the hilum region (seed coat) and  inside the seed (embryo) treated with 25 nm nCuO was \n\nthe  same. The spectra recorded in these regions are slightly different from the spectra \n\nobtained for the pristine 25 nm nCuO. The observed differences are the decrease of the pre-\n\nedge feature at 8 982 eV assigned to the 1s to 4p electronic transition in Cu1+ followed by an \n\nincrease of the white line  intensity. These two spectral changes are related to the  oxidation of \n\nCu1+ to Cu2+.40 The spectrum recorded in the radicle presented the features of the pristine \n\nmaterial.  \n\nFigure 2.12c shows a pronounced shoulder feature for the Cu located in the embryo of \n\nthe seed primed with nCuO. This feature is associated with Cu1+ and indicates that 40 nm \n\nnCuO was reduced compared to that found in the seed coat and outside of the seed. The linear \n\ncombination analysis (Figure  2.13) showed that spectra recorded in the embryo could be \n\n described as a mixture of 34 \u00b1 1% Cu2O and 66 \u00b1 1% CuO. Figure 2.12d shows that the \n\nchemical neighborhood of Cu incorporated by the seed tissues and radical in the samples \n\ntreated with 80 nm nCuO did not change and remained as CuO. The spectra recorded in the \n\nsamples perfectly overlapped that recorded for the pristine 80 nm nCuO powder.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n41\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.12 - Cu?K edge XAS spectra recorded in different regions of P. vulgaris seeds treated with 1 \n000 mg Cu L-1 dispersions of CuO nanoparticles. (a) Picture of a bean seed pointing out the three \nregions measured, (b) spectra recorded of the 25 nm nCuO treatment, (c) spectra recorded of the 40 \nnm nCuO treatment, and (d) spectra recorded of the 80 nm nCuO treatment  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 - Linear combination fit for Cu-K edge XAS spectra recorded in the embryo of a P. \nvulgaris seed treated with 40 nm nCuO at 1 000 mg Cu L-1 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n42\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe copper chemical environment in harvested Arabidopsis  thaliana seeds treated \n\nwith 20 and 50 mg L-1 nCuO was also  mostly in the form of CuO (88.8%), with some \n\nCu2(OH)PO4 (2.0%), Cu-acetate (3.2%), and Cu2O (6.0%).\n41 This suggests that nCuO can be \n\nalso accumulated in plant progeny.   \n\nAlthough our results showed a slight redox behavior for 40  and 25 nm nCuO in a \n\nphysiological environment, the Cu-based  nanoparticles used in this study were not as reactive \n\nas ZnO.37 This can be partially explained by the low solubility of the CuO  based \n\nnanoparticles. However, one has to keep in mind that the  sensitivity of XAS would hardly be \n\nable to identify the presence  of Cu factions below 5 wt %.   \n\nThe combined data supplied by EDXRF, \u00b5-XRF maps, \u00b5-XANES, and literature \n\nbackground on seed morphology39 suggested that the main Cu uptake mechanism takes place \n\nthrough diffusion driven by the concentration gradient. The main entrance region was the \n\nhilum spongy tissue. The  presence of CuO and Cu2O most likely indicated that the CuO \n\nnanoparticles were incorporated as entire particles instead of  anions. In addition to the \n\nspectroscopic speciation, this  hypothesis was supported by the hilum pore size, \n\nwhich reaches tens of micrometers (see the electronic Supporting Information of Duran et \n\nal.42). The presence of Cu  in the endosperm region away from the hilum (Figure 2.11c) also \n\nimplied that possibility of Cu to cross the seed coat structure. Nevertheless, the extent of the \n\npenetration into the endosperm was smaller. In this context, it is worth mentioning that \n\nthere are many pathways of Cu transportation in plants. In cell-to-cell  migration, Cu can be \n\ncoordinated by proteins like Cu  chaperones and Cu carriers, which transport Cu to the \n\norganelles.43   \n\n \n\n2.3.6 In vivo spatial distribution of Cu in the seedlings  \n\nIn  addition to the chemical maps that uncovered the spatial distribution of Cu in the \n\nseeds after the priming, we mapped the in vivo chemical distribution of Cu in the primary root \n\nof the seedling under development. We monitored seedlings primed in CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu \n\nL-1 and 40 nm nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 since these treatments showed significant effects \n\ncompared to the control according to the Dunnett\u2019s test.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n43\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.14a-c shows the pictures and corresponding Cu?K? chemical images for the \n\nemerging primary root of the seedling primed in CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L\n-1 on the third, \n\nfourth, and fifth day of germination, respectively. The chemical images revealed a hotspot of \n\nCu on the tip of the primary root, which remained on the same location along the monitored \n\nperiod and was not diluted during the growing process. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14 - Pictures and \u00b5-XRF chemical maps for Cu in the primary root of a P. vulgaris seed \nexposed to CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L\n\n-1 on the (a) third, (b) fourth, and (c) fifth day of germination \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 presents the pictures and chemical maps for the tip of the primary root of \n\nthe seedling treated with 40 nm nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 on the third (a), fourth (b), and fifth \n\n(c) day of the seedling growth. The results were similar to those found for CuSO4.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n44\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.15 - Pictures and \u00b5-XRF chemical maps for Cu in the primary root of a P. vulgaris seed \nexposed to nano CuO 40 nm at 100 mg Cu L-1 on the (a) third, (b) fourth, and (c) fifth day of \ngermination \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16 presents an optical microscope image that was allowed to precisely \n\nidentify the tissue in which the Cu spots were found. It corresponded to the root cap. We \n\nbelieve that the root cap incorporated Cu from the seed coat during the radical emergence. It \n\nis also noteworthy mentioning that the incorporation and diffusion of Cu could be favored by \n\nthe chemical properties of mucilage, especially in the soluble form. The chemical images also \n\nshowed that the Cu transferred to the root cap had low mobility. Part of the Cu could have \n\nbeen transferred to the meristem, site of intense cell division activity, which at low \n\nconcentrations may have favored root growth while at high concentration it might have \n\nprevented it. Previous experiments carried out by Wang and colleagues, in the model species \n\nArabidopsis thaliana, showed that nCuO treatments induce modulation of auxin related genes, \n\nsupporting the idea  that changes in root growth rates are related to the modulation  of auxin \n\nsensing and root size control.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n45\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.16 - Optical microscopy of primary roots of the common bean. The root cap is the site that \ncontained the highest Cu concentrations after exposure of the beans to CuO nanoparticles or CuSO4 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.7 Chemical reactivity of Cu based nanoparticles and  physiological effects \n\nThe deleterious effects of the 25 nm  CuO nanoparticles at 100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1 \n\ncould not be explained by the treatment concentration, since a different  behavior was found \n\nfor 40 and 80 nm nCuO. The crystal phase  effects could not be accessed in the present study \n\nsince for all particles the CuO were monoclinic. However, the literature indicated that for \n\nrutile and anatase TiO2 the crystal phase did not influence the uptake and translocation of \n\nTiO2 in wheat.\n44   \n\nFigure 2.17 shows the degradation of H2O2 by the CuO nanoparticle dispersions used \n\nto prime the seeds. The 40 and  80 nm nCuO presented similar behavior, taking nearly 300 \n\nmin  to produce 7.9 and 8.5 mL of O2, respectively. CuSO4 produced 18.5 mL of O2 in 180 \n\nmin. The most reactive nanoparticle was the 25 nm CuO that readily produced 18.5 mL of O2 \nin 30 min. The surface properties of core?shell structures can greatly differ from those \n\nexhibited by single phase materials. For example, the catalytic activity of Ru?Cu \n\nnanoparticles in converting NH3 into N2 and H2 depends on the number of Cu layers on top of \n\nRu.45 Facing the low solubility shown by all Cu-based nanoparticles used in the present study \n\nand the similar results obtained for the 40 and 80 nm CuO particles, we hypothesize that the \n\ndeleterious effects of the 25 nm particles may be caused by their modified surface properties. \n\n \n\n\n\n46\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 2.17 - H2O2 degradation rate in the presence of CuSO4 and 25, 40 and 80 nm nCuO \n\n \n\n \n\nConsidering the excess of Cu ions, the deleterious effects can be explained in the light \n\nof previous studies. The literature reports after 5 days of germination under normal conditions, \n\nan increase in protein and aminoacid content in Phaseolus beans.46 On the other hand, \n\ncotyledons of germinating bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) exposed to 200 \u00b5M CuCl2 (26.9 \n\nmg L-1) showed protein damage and oxidative stress. In common beans, Cu toxicity caused \n\ninactivation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an important nonlysosomal proteolytic \n\nsystem, and inhibition of leucine and proline aminopeptidase activities. These injuries led to a \n\ndeficiency in the cell\u2019s capability to remove oxidatively damaged proteins.47 Oxidative stress \n\nwas also found in lettuce treated with nCuO at 20 mg L-1. Cu reduced catalase and ascorbate \n\nperoxidase activities, two important antioxidant enzymes.33 Nevertheless, our chemical \n\nspeciation did not detect Cu binding to proteins. The chemical environments were mostly \n\nsimilar to those of pristine materials. It means that in the case Cu?protein interaction actually \n\nhappened, the fraction of Cu playing this role was below the XAS detection limit. In linear \n\ncombination analysis of XAS, a component weighting less than 5% would be hardly \n\ndetectable, since normalization can introduce errors on the order of 10%. \n\nBesides preventing the development of P. vulgaris, Cu based treatments led to \n\nreduction of the content of Ca, Fe, K, Mn, Zn, carbohydrates, and amino acids as was also \n\nobserved in the embryonic axis of seeds exposed to excess Cu (5 mmol L-1 or 672.2 mg L-1 of \n\nCuCl2). Oxidative damage may be enhanced in Cu-intoxicated tissues and affect membrane \n\nintegrity due to the lipid peroxidation process, which induces solute leakage from germinating \n\nseeds.48  \n\n\n\n47\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nChemical imaging combined with spectroscopic speciation showed that although Cu \n\nwas located in small hotspots instead of being spread homogeneously throughout the tissues, \n\nand most of the incorporated Cu remained in its pristine form, it strongly affected the \n\ngermination of the seeds and the growth of the seedlings. As discussed above, it is likely that \n\nlow  concentrations of promptly available Cu ions may have  impaired the proper functioning \n\nof proteins.  \n\n \n\n2.4 Conclusions \n\nIn agreement to the published literature, the present study  shows that much attention \n\nhas to be paid to the concentration  of the nanoparticles used in seed priming. At \n\nconcentrations  from 1 to 100 mg Cu L-1, 40 and 80 nm nCuO did not harm  the seed \n\ngermination and seedling development, while 40 nm  nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 favored weight \n\ngain. The 80 nm  nCuO did not affect weight gain, although it was able to increase \n\nconcentrations in the embryo to 40 \u00b1 9 mg Cu kg-1.  This might be a consequence of the slow \n\nrelease of Cu ions  from the oxide structure to the physiological solution.  Therefore, Cu in \n\nthese oxide forms can be used by the  developing seedling instead of intoxicating it, different \n\nfrom what happened for CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L\n-1 which prevented seedling growth. Hence, \n\ndepending on its physical-chemical  properties, CuO based nanoparticles might be considered \n\nfor  seed priming rather than soluble Cu sources, since the possibility of phytotoxicity by the \n\nlatter is higher.  \n\nThe current study also highlighted the importance of the  structure and chemical nature \n\nof the nanoparticle. The effects of 25 nm nCuO, which presented a metallic core covered by \n\nan  oxide shell structure, deserve further investigation. This  nanoparticle, probably due to its \n\nhigher surface reactivity, had  deleterious effects on bean seedling development. These results \n\nreinforce the necessity of care regarding the disposal of  nanoparticles in the environment and \n\ntheir usage as fertilizers.  \n\nReferences \n\n1 BORM, P. J. et al.

Although the \n\ngermination rate was not affected by the treatments (1 to 1 000 mg Fe L-1), seed soaking in \n\nFe3O4-PEG at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 increased radicle elongation (8.1\u00b1 1.1 cm vs. 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 cm for \n\nthe control). Conversely, Fe2+/Fe3+(aq) and bare Fe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 prevented the growth. \n\nX-ray spectroscopy and tomography showed that Fe penetrated in the seed. Enzymatic assays \n\nshowed that Fe3O4-PEG was least harmful treatment to ?-amylase. The growth promoted by \n\nthe Fe3O4-PEG might be related to water uptake enhancement induced by the PEG coating. \n\nThese results show the potential of using coated iron nanoparticles to enhance the growth of \n\ncommon food crops. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Phaseolus vulgaris L. Fe3O4 nanoparticle. Polyethylene glycol. Germination. X-\n\nray spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n\n\n54\t\n \u00a0\n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe population growth is pushing agriculture worldwide to intensify the use of \n\nchemical fertilizers in order to meet the increasing food demand. A large portion of fertilizers \n\napplied into the soil is lost by water leaching, strong adsorption, or in case of nitrogen \n\nsources, by evaporation. This loss affects negatively the environment, the sustainability of \n\nmineral inputs and the economic performance of agricultural activity. In this context, nano-\n\nsized fertilizers can become an alternative to increase plant uptake ratio. Thus, paving the way \n\nto a more sustainable strategy to improve nutrient delivery.1 \n\nNutrient seed priming is an option to deliver micronutrients to plants. A proper supply \n\nof micronutrients during the earlier growth stages may improve seedling emergence, grain \n\nyield and nutritional content.2 Nutrient primed seeds have been shown to increase yield of \n\nmaize,3 oat,4 wheat5; 6 and rice.7 Seedlings obtain nutrients partly from seed reserves and \n\npartly from soil. An adequate nutrient reserve in the seed is necessary to sustain seedling \n\ngrowth until roots starts the nutrient supply function.8 Although seed priming is commonly \n\npracticed by farmers, and a fairly investigated topic, we did not find any model explaining \n\nhow the nutrients applied to seeds migrate to the plant.  \n\nFe is mostly found as Fe3+ oxides and oxyhydroxides in cultivated (aerated) soils.9 \n\nDespite of their abundancy, compounds such as goethite, ferrihydrite and hematite presents \n\nKsp values ranging from 10-37 to 10-44, which make them virtually insoluble. Even though the \n\ntotal Fe content is high, its availability to plants is still low. The availability of Fe is also \n\ninfluenced by the crystallite size and degree of isomorphic substitution.10 It has been reported \n\nthat rates of dissolution decrease with the following order: ferrihydrite > lepidocrocite > \n\nmagnetite > hematite > goethite.11 \n\nEven though Fe3+ is more available than Fe2+, for most plants the preferred absorption \n\nform is Fe2+.9 Iron uptake differs for nongraminaceous and graminaceous plants. For the \n\nformer, plant species take up Fe via three mechanisms: (i) excreting protons from the roots to \n\nthe rhizosphere, reducing the soil solution pH and thus increasing Fe3+solubility; (ii) reducing \n\nFe3+ to Fe2+ by Fe3+-chelate reductase; and (iii) plasmalemma transport of Fe2+ by iron \n\ntransporters. On the other hand, roots of graminaceous species release phytosiderophores that \n\nchelate Fe3+ in the rhizosphere, and then specific plasmalemma transporters take the Fe3+-\n\nphytosiderophores complexes.1; 12 \n\n  \n\n\n\n55\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nIron is an essential element for plants. Its deficiency can limit plant development and \n\nreduce grain yield.13 It plays an important role in the photosynthetic activity, biosynthesis of \n\nmany enzymes, Fe-S protein clusters and hemeproteins like cytochromes. It is required in \n\nchloroplast thylakoids structure and chlorophyll synthesis.9 The legume\u2013rhizobium  \n\nsymbiosis is sensitive to Fe deficiency,14 Fe seems to be involved in nitrogen fixation through \n\nenzymes such as nitrogenase, nitrogen reductase and leghemoglobin.15 \n\nIn common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) Fe concentration in grains and shoot tissue is \n\naround 76 mg kg-1 and 154 mg kg-1,16 respectively. It means that at least ca. 653 g Fe ha-1 are \n\nnecessary for the proper culture development (the consulted data did not include Fe \n\nconcentration in roots, thus this is a lower boundary estimation). Since this nutrient is required \n\nin large quantities, seed priming can only supply part of plants requirements, especially for \n\nthe early phenological states. High loads of nutrients via seed treatment can induce phytotoxic \n\neffects.17; 18; 19  \n\nMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are currently used in drug delivery systems, \n\ncontrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, hyperthermia treatments, the production of \n\nmagnetic inks and magnetic seals in motors, to name a few applications.20 In all instances, \n\niron nanoparticle effects vary according to their chemical composition, size, morphology, \n\naggregation state, applied concentration as well as experimental conditions like temperature \n\nand time of exposure. Nano magnetite was chosen for this study because of it is a well-\n\ncharacterized nanomaterial. It is easy to synthetize, relatively cheap and used in several types \n\nof applications, especially biotechnological ones.21; 22; 23; 24; 25   \n\nIn the agricultural scenario, the effects of iron nanoparticles have been observed in the \n\nuptake, transport, accumulation and development of plant species. It has been previously \n\ndemonstrated that iron oxide nanoparticles accumulated in pumpkin plants tissues,26 \n\nstimulated the development of peanut27 and watermelon28 seedlings, but did not affect growth \n\nand chlorophyll content of lettuce.22  \n\nMagnetite nanoparticles are prone to aggregation due to a combined effect of their \n\nhigh surface area to volume ratio and their strong magnetization, which however limits t \n\nheir use for bio-applications.29 To address the former problem, magnetite nanoparticles are  \n\nusually synthesized in the presence of surfactants, forming a coating layer preventing \n\naggregation. Common surfactants are polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), \n\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), chitosan and dextran.21  \n\n  \n\n\n\n56\t\n \u00a0\n\nAmong them, PEG is a hydrophilic polymer widely used for biomedical applications, \n\nbeing biocompatible, non-immunogenic, and non-antigenic.30 \n\nIn this work, we report the effect of Fe3O4-PEG and bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the \n\ngermination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds. The effects of 1, 10, \n\n100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 seed soaking treatments were observed on the germination rate, \n\nradicle elongation and ?-amylase activity of 5-days old seedlings. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) \n\nand absorption (XANES) spectroscopy, X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM-EDX) uncovered the Fe uptake and spatial distribution. \n\n \n\n3.2 Materials and Methods \n\n3.2.1 Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles \n\nBare magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) were synthetized by a co-precipitation method \n\nusing a mixture of iron (III) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2\u00b74H2O) and iron (II) chloride \n\nhexahydrate (FeCl3\u00b76H2O), both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich at a 2:1 molar ratio of \n\nFe3+:Fe2+, mFeCl3 = 7.00 g, mFeCl2= 2.58 g in 300 ml DI water. The solution was poured in a \n\nthree-neck round bottom flask provided with a condenser, nitrogen and liquid inlets. Then  \n\n0.5 ml of a 37 % wt. HCl were added under gentle agitation. Oxygen was purged using \n\nnitrogen for 20 minutes prior the addition of 100 ml 1.5 M NH4OH. The solution quickly \n\nturned black, indicating the beginning of the production of the nanoparticles. The reaction \n\nlasted 1 hour at 20 ?C and nitrogen was supplied during the whole reaction. After the \n\nsynthesis, the nanoparticles were washed using cycles of deoxygenated DI water and \n\nmagnetic decantation. Then, the nanoparticles were dried at room temperature under vacuum \n\nfor 24 h and immediately characterized. \n\nA slightly modified procedure was used to produce Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles  \n\n(nFe3O4-PEG), which consisted in dissolving the iron salts in 300 ml of a 10 % wt PEG \n\n(Mw10 000) in DI water solution prior the addition of NH4OH. Reaction and washing \n\nconditions were the same as described above.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Characterization of pristine Fe3O4 nanoparticles and dispersions \n\nThe composition of each set of nanoparticles was determined by energy dispersive  \n\nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF; EDX-720 Shimadzu, Japan). Two hundred \n\nmilligrams of pristine powders were weighted in a 6.3 mm aperture X-ray fluorescence \n\n\n\n57\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nspectroscopy (XRF) sample cup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with a 5 \u00b5m thick \n\npolypropylene film (no. 3520 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA). The samples were analyzed using a \n\nrhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable current adjusted for a detector deadtime \n\nbelow 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing \n\na Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The analyses were carried out in triplicate and the quantitative \n\nmethod selected was the fundamental parameters. \n\nNanoparticle size and morphology were evaluated via transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100 Plus, USA). \n\nCrystal size and phase identification were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), \n\nusing a Bruker D8-Advance diffractometer (Bruker-AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with \n\nCu K? radiation. Measurements were recorded for 2? values from 20 to 80?. Using the \n\nbroadening of the peaks it was possible to estimate the crystallite size by the Scherrer \n\nequation:  \n\nD(hkl) = K? / ?cos? \n\n \n\nwhere D is the mean crystal size of the nanoparticles, K the Scherrer constant (0.94 for \n\nspherical crystals with cubic symmetry ), ? the wavelength of light used for the diffraction \n\n(0.154184 nm to Cu), ? the full width at half maximum of the peak, and ? refers to the angle \n\nmeasured. \n\nThe coated and uncoated magnetite nanoparticles were suspended in deionized water \n\nand dispersed using an ultrasonic processor (model 705 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher \n\nScientific, USA) under 50% amplitude for 15 min, with 30 s interval every minute, at 1, 10, \n\n100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The hydrodynamic size and the zetapotential of the nanomaterials at \n\n100 mg Fe L-1 were analyzed via dynamic light scattering (DLS; Zetasizer Nano, Malvern \n\nInstruments, UK). \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Germination assay \n\nThe effects of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG on the germination of Phaseolus vulgaris L. \n\nseeds were evaluated. Since one-third of the Fe atoms in magnetite occurs as Fe2+ and two-\n\nthirds occur as Fe3+,31 an iron ionic reference treatment (herein referred as soluble-Fe)  \n\nwas prepared as a mixture of one-third of FeSO4.7H2O and two-thirds of Fe2(SO4)3.nH2O, \n\nboth purchased from Reagen (Brazil). \n\n  \n\n\n\n58\t\n \u00a0\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris L. seeds, cultivar Sintonia, were supplied by the Agronomic \n\nInstitute of Campinas (IAC), presented an average germination rate of 80%. This seed was \n\nchosen as model species because of its low dormancy, which results in a plant of small size \n\nand short growth cycle, i.e. an ideal test case. In addition, P. vulgaris is an important and \n\naccessible source of protein.32   \n\nSeeds were first immersed in a 10% NaClO solution under stirring for 10 s for \n\ndisinfection, followed by rinsing with deionized water. Subsequently, twenty seeds were \n\nsoaked for 20 min in the appropriate concentration of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG dispersions. \n\nSoluble-Fe solutions at the same concentrations were used as a positive control, whereas \n\ndeionized water was used as a negative control. After exposure, the seeds were placed on a \n\n15-cm paper filter fitted on the bottom of a Petri dish, and 8 mL of the soaking solution was \n\nadded to moisturize the paper filter. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis \n\nCompany Inc., USA), inserted into a plastic bag preventing water loss, and finally incubated \n\nin a germination chamber (TE-4020, Tecnal, BR) under dark and ventilation at 27 \u00b0C for five \n\ndays. Five replicates of the experiment were conducted per treatment. \n\nFive days after the sowing the assay was completed and the number of germinated \n\nseeds counted to determine the rate of germination. The radicle length of the seedlings was \n\nmeasured, manually removed and weighted. Afterwards, radicles and seeds were both rinsed \n\nwith deionized water to remove the surface-bound metal or nano metal oxide and then dried \n\nin a laboratory oven (515/4A, FANEM, Brazil) at 60 \u00b0C for two days.  \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Radicle length determination \n\nAt the end of the germination period, the five replicates of seedlings from each \n\ntreatment were separately transferred to a black cardboard, then a HP Scanjet 2410 scanner \n\noperated by Photosmart software was used to obtain scanned images of the seedlings. The \n\nradicle length (cm) of the seedlings was determined through the digitized images using the \n\nSeed Vigor Imaging System software (SVIS\u00ae).33 \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Iron uptake quantification \n\nEach treatment replicates were grouped and the dried seedlings carefully separated in \n\nthree fractions: cotyledon, seed coat and radicle. The cotyledons were then ground using a \n\nmortar mill (MA890, Marconi, Brazil). One gram of each component was weighed in a \n\ndecontaminated porcelain crucible and then digested by dry ashing method using a muffle \n\n\n\n59\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nfurnace (F-2, Fornitec, Brazil) at 100 \u00b0C h-1 ramp rate up to 550\u00b0C and then ashed for 14 h. \n\nEach dry ashing digestion batch included a blank to ensure no contamination. The ashes were \n\ndissolved in 5 mL of 1 M HNO3(aq), then 200 \u00b5L of this solution plus 750 \u00b5L of ultra pure \n\nwater was transferred into a 1.5 mL vial, and 50 \u00b5L of 1 000 mg Ga L-1 was added as an \n\ninternal standard. Then, the sample was homogenized using a tube shaker vortex (MA162, \n\nMarconi, Brazil). \n\nThe Fe content of the digested samples was determined by EDXRF. For that, 10 \u00b5L of \n\nthe digests were pipetted on the external side of the window of a 6.3 mm XRF sample cup \n\n(no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) and sealed with a 5 \u00b5m thick polypropylene film (no. 3520 - \n\nSpex Ind. Inc., USA). The cups were then left drying in a laboratory oven at 60\u00b0C. The \n\nsamples were triplicate analyzed using a rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable \n\ncurrent with a deadtime at 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample \n\nwas acquired utilizing a Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The quantification was performed using \n\nexternal standard calibration. The trueness of this method was assessed analyzing two \n\ncertified reference materials: apple leaves (NIST 1515) and peach leaves (NIST 1547). \n\n \n\n3.2.6 nFe3O4 solubility \n\nTo verify the Fe solubility of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG, aqueous dispersions of 15 mL \n\nwere prepared at 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 using a probe ultrasonic device (Fisher Scientific\u2122 \n\nModel 705 Sonic Dismembrator). The equipment was operated at 95 W (amplitude of 50 %) \n\nand 50 J, during 15 x 1 min with an interval of 30 s between each cycle. After 24 hours, one \n\nmilliliter of each dispersion was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and then centrifuged by a \n\nmicrocentrifuge (Mikro 120, Hettich, Germany) for 60 minutes at 13 000 rpm.  \n\nQuantitative analysis of the supernatants was performed by EDXRF (EDX-720, \n\nShimadzu, Japan). Fifteen milliliters of the supernatants were dripped in a 6.3 window cuvette \n\n(no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) assembled with a five micrometer thick polypropylene film, \n\nand dried at 60\u00b0C in a laboratory oven. After repeating this procedure twice, the samples were \n\nmeasured using the same experimental condition of nFe3O4 characterization. The \n\nquantification was performed using external standard calibration and Ga as internal standard. \n\nThe measurements were performed in triplicate.  \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0  \n\n\n\n60\t\n \u00a0\n\n3.2.7 Mapping Fe accumulation spots \n\nThe seeds were exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for \n\n20 min, dried at room temperature and gently cut in the middle using a stainless steel blade. \n\nSubsequently, the seeds were placed on a sample holder with a Kapton tape and the \n\ncotyledon\u2019s inner side exposed for analysis. \n\nThe microanalysis was carried out using a benchtop microprobe X-ray fluorescence \n\nspectrometer (\u00b5-XRF) system (Orbis PC EDAX, USA) operated with a Rh X-ray tube  \n\nat 40 kV and 300 \u00b5A and using a 25 \u00b5m Ni filter. A polycapillary optic provided a 30 \u00b5m  \n\nX-ray beam spot size. The detection was carried out by a 30 mm2 silicon drift detector  \n\n(140 eV FWHM at the 5.9 keV Mn-K? line) with a deadtime of nearly 3%. Maps were \n\nregistered using a matrix of 64x50 pixels (number of analyzed points on xy- axes) and dwell \n\ntime per pixel of 1 s.  \n\nAdditionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a \n\nJEOL JSM-5600LV SEM. The hilum of the bean seeds was removed using a razor blade and \n\ntransversally cut. The samples were coated with Au and placed in the stubs for measurements. \n\nThe chemical composition of specific parts of the imaged tissues were determined using the \n\nX-ray energy disperse detector (EDX) of the microscope.  \n\n \n\n3.2.8 3D distribution and chemical speciation of Fe in the hilum \n\nCommon beans have a hilum associated to the seed coat, and near the hilum there is \n\nthe micropyle, a small pore that allows water uptake into the seed.34 We employed X-ray \n\ntomography to verify the 3D distribution of Fe in the hilum region of treated seeds, and the \n\nchemical speciation of Fe in the hilum was performed by means of X-ray absorption near \n\nedge spectroscopy (XANES). \n\nCommon bean seeds were exposed to nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 \n\nfor 20 min and dried at room temperature. A small fraction of the seed coat containing the \n\nhilum were carefully collected and cut using a razor blade. \n\nTomograms were acquired at the X-ray imaging beamline (IMX) at the 1.37 GeV \n\nBrazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). At IMX beamline, \n\nsynchrotron radiation was generated by a bending-magnet. The measurements were carried \n\nout using a pink beam from 4 to 14 keV and 1024 projections were taken under 180o rotation. \n\nThe exposure time was 300 ms per projection. The image was magnified and focused on a \n\n\n\n61\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\ncooled camera detector (CCD; PCO.2000, PCO, Germany). Pictures of the sample holders \n\ncontaining the seed coat fractions and the experimental X-ray tomography setup are presented \n\nin the electronic Supporting Information of Duran et al.35 \n\nTo complement these data, the same samples were also submitted to \u00b5-XRF mapping. \n\nThe analysis parameters and experimental setup were the same as above mentioned (mapping \n\nFe accumulation spots). \n\nThe XANES measurements were carried out at the Fe K edge in fluorescence mode at \n\nXAFS2 beamline of LNLS (Brazil). At this experimental station the X-rays are generated by \n\ndipole bending magnet, the higher harmonics are rejected by a set of mirrors, the energy was \n\nselected by a Si(111) monochromator and the X-ray beam was focused to a spot of ca.  \n\n500 \u00b5m by a Rh coated mirror. The fluorescence was detected by a 15 element Ge solid state \n\nCanberra detector. The spectra were energy calibrated using a Fe foil, normalized and \n\nsubjected to linear combination analysis from -20 to 50 eV above the edge. The reference \n\ncompounds were nFe3O4-PEG and the pristine bean. We also measured pelletized nFe3O4 and \n\niron (II) and (III) sulfates. The analysis was accomplished using the IFEFFIT code.36  \n\n \n\n3.2.9 Reactivity of soluble-Fe and magnetite nanoparticles  \n\nThe reactivity of the soluble-Fe and magnetite nanoparticles was evaluated measuring \n\ntheir ability to decompose H2O237 through a Fenton-like reaction.38 In a 25 mL round-bottom \n\nreaction flask, 19.5 mL of a 1 000 mg Fe L-1 aqueous dispersion of the tested nanoparticles \n\nand soluble-Fe solution was magnetically stirred. The flask was connected to a 25 mL \n\ngraduated pipette through a silicone tube. The pipette was immersed in a measuring cylinder \n\nwater column. Then, 0.5 mL of 30% v/v H2O2 solution was inserted in the reaction flask with \n\na syringe. The volume of the produced O2 was monitored by following the shift of a water \n\ncolumn in pipette.  \n\n \n\n3.2.10 ?-amylase activity  \n\nThe evaluations for the ?-amylase enzyme followed the recommendations of Fuwa.39 \n\nP. vulgaris seeds were soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for \n\n20 min and then germinated in paper rolls inside a germination chamber (Mangelsdorf, \n\nDeLeo, Brazil) at 25\u00b0C. The experiment was quadruplicate conducted with 20 seeds per \n\nreplicate. The seedlings were collected on the 7th day after sowing, subsequently nearly 1 g \n\nwere weighed and macerated using a mortar and pestle in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.9) \n\n\n\n62\t\n \u00a0\n\nat a 9:1 (distilled water: buffer) ratio. This material was centrifuged for 4 min at 12 000 g  \n\n(NT 805, Novatecnica, Brazil), then the supernatant was removed for the enzymatic analysis, \n\nand 1% starch solution was used as substrate. The value of 1 U (Enzymatic Unit) was \n\nconsidered to be the reduction of 10% of the colorimetric intensity of the amylose-iodine \n\ncomplex. \n\n \n\n3.2.11 Statistical analysis  \n\nThe number of germinated seeds and the radicle length and weight data were \n\nsubmitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s multiple range tests at 95% \n\nconfidence interval using the Action Stat software (version 3.3.111.1178, Estatcamp, BR). \n\n \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\n3.3.1 Characterization of the nanoparticles and dispersions \n\nThe purity of the nFe3O4 and Fe3O4-PEG was determined by EDXRF. Considering the \n\nlimits of detection of the method, ca. of mg kg-1, no contaminants were found in the \n\nnanoparticles. Figure 3.1 presents the XRF spectra of these samples. XRD patterns, presented \n\nin Figure 3.2, showed an average crystallite size in the direction of the plane (220) of 11.6 nm \n\nfor the uncoated and 13.9 nm for coated magnetite nanoparticles, respectively (see the \n\ncrystallite size in the direction of the other planes in Table 3.1). These results were in \n\nagreement with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations (Figure 3.3),  \n\nwith presumed average particle size of 11 nm for nFe3O4 and 12 nm for Fe3O4-PEG. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - XRF Spectra of the magnetite nanomaterials used in this study.

The discrepancy between nanoparticle size shown by \n\nTEM and that measured by the DLS indicates particle aggregation. Such behavior and \n\naggregate sizes are in agreement with reported values of 208 \u00b1 15 nm for 50-60 nm nFe3O4 \n\nsuspended in water at 10 mg L-1 and 438 \u00b1 13 nm at 20 mg L-1.22 One could visually observe \n\nthat such aggregates make these magnetite dispersions very unstable. At 1 000 mg Fe L-1, \n\nmost particles were settled after 60 min, even in the nFe3O4-PEG case.  \n\nThe aggregation is controlled by an equilibrium between particles attraction (Van der \n\nWalls forces) and repulsion (surface changes or steric hindrance).40; 41 The pH registered for \n\nthe uncoated magnetite dispersion and coated one were 5.58, and 5.08, respectively. \n\nNormally, for a same material lower pH values should lead to more positive zeta potentials.42 \n\nZeta-potential measurements indicated that the uncoated magnetite presented a negative \n\nvalue, whereas the PEG coated presented positive value. Thus, the sign of surface charges of \n\nFe3O4-PEG was determined by the coating rather than by the pH. The measured ?-potential \n\nfor the uncoated samples was different from values reported in the literature, 4.31 \u00b1 0.05 mV \n\nfor the less concentrated dispersion (10 mg L-1) and 3.99 \u00b1 0.4 mV for the highest one  \n\n(20 mg L-1).22 \n\n\n\n65\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nTable 3.2 - Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG dispersions \ndetermined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) \n\nMagnetite type \nZeta-\n\npotential \n(mV) \n\nHydrodynamic Diameter (nm) \n\nPeak 1 Peak 2 Peak 3 \n\nnFe3O4 -14 \u00b1 7 71 \u00b1 10 (12%) 310 \u00b1 60 (88%) -- \n\nnFe3O4-PEG 9 \u00b1 6 170 \u00b1 60 (54%) 480 \u00b1 150 (41%) 2 700 \u00b1 160 (5%) \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Effects of magnetite nanoparticles on P. vulgaris seed germination and radicle \ngrowth \n\nThe number of germinated seeds was counted daily and all the radicles emerged \n\nalmost in the same period. At the end of the germination assay, the deionized water treatment \n\ncontrol gave an average germination rate of 88.8% (Figure 3.4). All the others treatments had \n\nhigher or comparable values to the negative control. The highest germination rate was found \n\nfor 1 mg Fe L-1 of nFe3O4 and 10 mg Fe L-1 of nFe3O4-PEG (97 and 96%, respectively). \n\nHowever, under ANOVA statistical analysis, no difference was found among treatments and \n\ncontrols (p&lt;0.05). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Germination rate of P. vulgaris seeds exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe (1, 10, \n100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1) and H2O after 5 days of germination \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n66\t\n \u00a0\n\nAlthough the treatments did not affect the germination rate, a different scenario was \n\nobserved in the radicle elongation of the seedlings. The phenotypic images of the seedlings \n\nafter 5 days of Fe treatments exposure (Figure 3.5) indicate that the highest applied \n\nconcentration was toxic for the seedlings development, while it was not observed for the \n\nnFe3O4-PEG treatment. \n\nFigure 3.5 - Seedlings of P. vulgaris whose seeds were soaked in (a) H2O, (b) nFe3O4, (c) nFe3O4-PEG \nand (d) soluble-Fe. Applied concentrations were 1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe average length of the radicle of negative control was 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 cm long, whilst \n\nnFe3O4 and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 shortened it, yielding 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 cm, \n\nrespectively. Conversely, PEG improved the radicle development even at its higher \n\nconcentration, where the highest radicle elongation of 8.1 \u00b1 1.1 cm was observed (Figure \n\n3.6a). One of the hypotheses to explain this result regards the hydrophilic nature of the PEG.43 \n\nThe polymeric coating might have reduced the water potential, which caused greater water \n\nabsorption by the tissues. If so, it may have aided the root growth by redirecting water to a \n\nregion close to the root of the seedlings. Furthermore, the nanoparticles distribution on seed \n\ncoat was more homogeneous where PEG was added. This allowed a controlled absorption of \n\nnFe3O4, by reducing the water surface tension.44 \n\nAfter the length measurements, the radicles were removed and weighed (Figure 3.6b). \n\nThe same trend was observed for length and weight, radicles from water treatment presented \n\n1.94 \u00b1 0.13 g and nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 had 0.82 \u00b1 0.09 g. According to the Tukey's test \n\n(p&lt;0.05), radicle length was significantly different from the control at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for all \n\n\n\n67\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nthe tested materials, positively for nFe3O4-PEG and negatively for nFe3O4 and soluble-Fe \n\ntreatments (Figure 3.7). However, radicle weight data were only statistically different from \n\ncontrol for nFe3O4 and soluble-Feat 1 000 mg Fe L-1 (Figure 3.8). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 - (a) Radicle length and (b) weight of P. vulgaris seedlings whose seeds were soaked in \nnFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L\n\n-1) and H2O (control) \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Radicle lenght of P. vulgaris seedlings as function of the applied concentration of \nmagnetite nanoparticles and soluble-fe (mg Fe L-1).

The data points followed by the same letter were \nsignificantly different according to the Tukey (p &lt;0.05) \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\nThe phytotoxicity observed for high concentrations of soluble-Fe and nFe3O4 might be \n\nrelated to the Fe accumulation in the seed tissues. Such conclusion is reinforced by the fact \n\nthat the absorption of soluble-Fe occurs mainly by the micropyle, determinant structure for \n\nwater imbibition by seeds,45 mainly in the initial stages of the germination process as will be \n\ndiscussed in depth below. \n\nStudies reported root shortening as a response to the increase of nanoparticles \n\nconcentration in the dispersion, as demonstrated for ZnO,46; 47 Ag,48 CuO17; 49 and TiO2.50  \n\nThe anomalous behavior found for Fe in the present study was also observed for white \n\nmustard, where the root elongation of the seedlings treated with the highest nFe3O4 \n\nconcentrations (100 and 1 000 mg L-1) was higher than the lower tested concentration  \n\n(10 mg L-1), however the difference was not statistically significant.25 On the other hand, \n\nsoybean and rice seeds treated with ?-Fe2O3 nanoparticles at 500, 1 000 and 2 000 mg L-1 \n\ndeveloped seedlings with the root elongation significantly higher than the control.51; 52 \n\nNano zerovalent iron at 5 000 mg L-1 also promoted the root elongation of Arabidopsis \n\nthaliana by 150-200% compared to the control, with the elongation caused by hydroxyl \n\nradical-induced cell-wall loosening.53 Other authors observed that ?-Fe2O3 nanoparticles \n\npromoted the growth of peanut by regulating the antioxidant enzyme activity and the content \n\n\n\n69\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nof abscisic acid, a phytohormone that stimulates the senescence and reduces the metabolism. \n\nThe peanut root dry biomass was increased by Fe2O3 nanoparticles at 1 000 mg kg-1 applied to \n\nthe soil.54 \n\nSince PEG is hydrophilic, it can prevent the nFe3O4-PEG from interacting with cells \n\nand/or proteins.30 The surface chemistry modification of iron oxide nanoparticles by PEG \n\nreduced the cytotoxicity and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the cell length \n\nbeing not affected compared to the ones treated with bare nanoparticles.55 Also, it was \n\npreviously shown that the uptake of PEG-coated magnetite by macrophage cells was much \n\nlower than that of uncoated nanoparticles.23; 24 \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Determination of Fe uptake by P. vulgaris seeds \n\nAfter the germination assays, the seedling tissues were divided and the Fe content was \n\ndetermined. Figure 3.9 presents the concentration of Fe in the (a) seed coat, (b) cotyledon and \n\n(c) radicle of the seedlings exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe and water negative \n\ncontrol.  \n\nThe negative control (deionized water) revealed that Fe was more concentrated in the \n\nseed coat of the tested common beans than in the other tissues analyzed. It presented  \n\n92.3 \u00b1 0.6 mg Fe kg-1 in contrast to 46.6 \u00b1 1.4 mg Fe kg-1 in the cotyledons and 72.8 \u00b1 0.5 mg \n\nFe kg-1 in the radicle. In the case of the seedlings with nanoparticle treatment, the ones soaked \n\nin nFe3O4 presented similar Fe content in the three analyzed regions regardless of the applied \n\nconcentration. The difference between the water control and nFe3O4 treatment reached a \n\nmaximum value of 50% in the seed coat sample soaked in 1 000 mg Fe L-1. It reached more \n\nthan 6000-fold higher for the soluble-Fe treatment. For the highest treatment concentration, \n\nthe incorporation of Fe from the nFe3O4-PEG in the seed coat and in the radicle was \n\nintermediate between those of nFe3O4 and soluble-Fe.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n70\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 3.9 - Iron concentration in the (a) seed coat, (b) cotyledon and (c) radicle of germinated P. \nvulgaris seeds soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L\n\n-1 and H2O \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPriming rice seeds with Zn also substantially increased the Zn concentration in the \n\nhusk, but not in the endosperm. This study suggests that part of the Zn accumulated in the \n\nhusk during the priming process can be transported to the endosperm during the germination. \n\nIt was stated since the Zn concentration declined at the same time that increased in the \n\nendosperm, and this was not the case of unprimed seeds.56 \n\nTo estimate the contribution of dissolved Fe on the seedling development and  \n\nFe uptake, solubility tests in deionized water were performed. For nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG \n\ndispersions at 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1, the soluble Fe fractions were not quantitatively \n\ndetected, i.e. they were below the limit of quantification of the method (0.15 mg Fe L-1).  \n\nA study carried out by Landa et al.25 found soluble-Fe fractions at 6.51 \u00b1 2.24 mg Fe L-1 in \n\nthe supernatant of a cultivation medium supplemented with nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg L-1.  \n\n\n\n71\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nAnyhow, it is important to keep in mind that the presence of other molecules can induce the \n\ngeneration of soluble complexes with Fe. \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Spatial distribution and chemical speciation of Fe in the primed seeds \n\nFigure 3.10 presents the internal side of the cotyledon of a P. vulgaris seeds soaked for \n\n20 min in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The results corroborate the \n\nquantitative analysis, indicating that the treatments concentrated Fe in the seed coat, mainly in \n\nthe hilum region, and the number of XRF counts was almost 5-fold higher for the soluble-Fe \n\ntreatment compared to the nanoparticle one.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 - \u00b5-XRF chemical maps for Fe in P. vulgaris seeds soaked in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) \nsoluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n72\t\n \u00a0\n\nAdditional \u00b5-XRF chemical maps were recorded specifically in the hilum region of the \n\ntreated seeds. The images of the Fe distribution in the hilum revealed a different pattern of \n\ndistribution between seeds soaked in nFe3O4-PEG dispersion and soluble-Fe solution at 1 000 \n\nmg Fe L-1 (Figure 3.11). The nanoparticle treatment presented Fe mainly concentrated in the \n\nedge around the hilum (Figure 3.11a), while soluble-Fe presented a hotspot in the micropyle \n\n(Figure 3.11b). Another study using magnetic resonance microscopy showed that during the \n\nimbibition process, water enters the P. vulgaris seed through the micropyle57. Thus, we \n\nconclude that this structure acted also as a channel for soluble Fe ions. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 - Pictures of the hilum of P. vulgaris seeds soaked in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) soluble-Fe \nat 1 000 mg Fe L-1 and its corresponding \u00b5-XRF chemical maps for Fe \n\n \n\n \n\nThe hilum is a sponge-like tissue, thus besides sticking on the tissue\u2019s outer surface, \n\nthe nanoparticles can penetrate through the channels reaching the seed\u2019s internal layers.  \n\nIn spite of X-ray fluorescence\u2019s high analytical sensitivity, it yielded only 2D maps. The  \n\n6.4 keV K? photons emitted by Fe atoms embedded in the seed coat can escape from a depth \n\nthat lies in the mm range. Images such as these shown in Figure 3.11 cannot specify whether \n\nFe is only adsorbed on the surface of the seed coat or also inside the hilum tissue. \n\n  \n\n\n\n73\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nHence, the hilum region of treated seeds was subjected to further X-ray tomography \n\nanalysis. Figure 3.12 shows 3D projections and slices of phase contrast tomography for the \n\nseed coat of seeds soaked in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for  \n\n20 min. The green regions, highlighted by the red circles, indicate the presence of Fe that \n\npenetrated within the hilum sponge tissue. This can be observed for both nFe3O4-PEG and \n\nsoluble-Fe. The combination of \u00b5-XRF and X-ray tomography unequivocally showed that Fe \n\nsupplied under nanoparticle format could enter in the seeds. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 - X-ray tomograms of the hilum of a P. vulgaris seed treated with (a) Fe3O4-PEG \nnanoparticle and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 dispersion for 20 min. The green spots highlighted \nby the red circles indicates the presence of Fe embedded in the organic tissue \n\n \n\n \n\nX-ray tomography was previously employed to understand physiological seed \n\ndevelopment of rice,58 maize59 and oilseed rape,60 observe germination behavior of sugar beet \n\nseeds,61 and also to analyze archaeological seeds in the investigation of crop domestication.62; \n\n63 However, to the best of our knowledge, no other study examined 3D images of a \n\nnanoparticle-treated bean seed, although some researchers used this technique to verify the \n\nuptake and distribution of gold and yttrium nanoparticles in Arabidopsis thaliana64 and \n\ncabbage plants.65 \n\n  \n\n\n\n74\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe chemical form of Fe trapped in the hilum was evaluated by Fe K edge XANES. \n\nFigure 3.13a shows the XANES spectra for the control bean (pristine without any treatment), \n\nnFe3O4-PEG, Fe2(SO4)3 and Fe(SO4) reference compounds. The spectral features are a \n\nfunction of the chemical environment. The energy of the threshold depends on the oxidation \n\nstate, this is the reason why Fe2+ (Fe(SO4)) is shifted towards lower energies compared to \n\nFe2(SO4)3. The threshold energy for the control bean and nFe3O4-PEG fall in between Fe2+ \n\nand Fe3+, which indicates that these two latter samples are composed of mixed iron oxidation \n\nstates. This is well known for magnetite, but to the best of our knowledge it has never been \n\nreported for bean seeds.   \n\nFigure 3.13b presents the XANES spectrum for the hilum of a seed treated with \n\nnFe3O4-PEG and its respective linear combination analysis fit. The Fe in the treated hilum can \n\nbe defined as mixture of 75 wt% nFe3O4-PEG and 25 wt% control bean. In spite of its \n\ncapabilities, the XANES ability to distinguish fractions in a linear combination analysis is \n\nlimited. Due to its intrinsic sensibility, XANES would hardly detected fraction below  \n\n5 wt%.66 To assure that the detected Fe was not simply adsorbed on the surface of the hilum, \n\nthe tissue was carefully washed and measured again. Figure 3.13c shows that after successive \n\nrising, the fraction of nFe3O4-PEG decreased to 47 wt%. This happened because the iron \n\nparticles lying on the surface were removed during the washing process.  \n\nThe presence of Fe within the hilum was also confirmed by SEM-EDX. Figure 3.14 \n\nshow the images for nFe3O4-PEG treated hilum cross sections. It is possible to distinguish an \n\nagglomerate of particles; the EDX detector confirmed that this structure was a Fe hotspot \n\n(Figure 3.14e).  \n\nThanks to the complementary of spectroscopic and imaging tools, we can state that the \n\nFe structures within the hilum are magnetite particles incorporated during the seed treatment.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n75\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 3.13 - (a) Fe K edge XANES spectra for the control bean (pristine without any treatment), nFe3O4-PEG, \nFe2(SO4)3 and Fe(SO4) reference compounds; (b) Linear combination fit for Fe K edge XANES spectrum for the \nhilum of a seed treated with nFe3O4-PEG; (c) Linear combination fit for the hilum of a seed treated with nFe3O4-\nPEG after washing \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n76\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 3.14 - SEM image of the hilum cross section of a P. vulgaris seed treated with nFe3O4-PEG at \n1 000 mg Fe L-1.

The most reactive nanoparticle was nFe3O4 which produced 12.4 mL of O2 \n\nin 300 min, while nFe3O4-PEG produced 7.5 mL in the same time. On the other hand, \n\nsoluble-Fe readily produced 22.1 mL in 8 min (Figure 3.15). Iron catalyzes the decomposition \n\nof H2O2 trough Fenton reaction. The high reactivity of the soluble-Fe is due to the availability \n\nof free ionic Fe that leads to homogenous Fenton reaction, which is faster than the \n\nheterogeneous one.67 On the other hand, the lower reactivity of the PEG coated nanoparticles \n\nmay be the result of a lower number of available Fe sites, since the nanoparticle surface is \n\nsterically hindered by the polymeric chains. This result may explain the non-deleterious \n\neffects caused by the coated nanoparticles in the radicle elongation, even at high \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 - H2O2 degradation rate in the presence of nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe. The \nuncoated magnetite decomposed the H2O2 faster compared to the coated one. However, the former \nwere much slower compared to the O2 release from the soluble-Fe \n\n \n\n3.3.6 ?-amylase activity \n\nThe energy source necessary for the germination and early seedling development of \n\nleguminous comes mainly from the degradation of proteins and carbohydrates present  \n\nin the seed reserves. Protein and starch comprise about 20% and 40% of the whole  \n\nP. vulgaris seed, respectively.68 Here we evaluated the ?-amylase (starch degrading enzyme) \n\n\n\n78\t\n \u00a0\n\nactivity in the seedlings whose seeds were soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at  \n\n1 000 mg Fe L-1. \n\nCompared to the result that was obtained for the non-treated seeds (1600 \u00b1 300 U), \n\nsoluble-Fe treatment presented the lowest enzymatic activity, followed by nFe3O4 (730 \u00b1 30 \n\nand 760 \u00b1 140 U, respectively). Reinforcing what was observed in the radicle development \n\nand in the chemical reactivity analysis, nFe3O4-PEG treatment was the least harmful to  \n\nthe ?-amylase activity (900 \u00b1 180 U) (Table 3.3). \n\n?-amylase is a metalloenzyme which needs Ca2+ to its activity and stability, its affinity \n\nis much stronger than that with others ions.69 Since Fe2+ is also a divalent ion, its presence in \n\nabundance could provoke a competition with Ca2+ during the ?-amylase biosynthesis, leading \n\nto enzymatic activity loss. This possibility is supported by the previously observed reduction \n\nof amylase activity in vitro in fish intestine after Fe2+ addition (50 mg kg-1).70 \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 - ?-amylase activity in P. vulgaris seedlings whose seeds were soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-\nPEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The value of 1 U (enzymatic activity unit) is the reduction of \n10% of the colorimetric intensity of the amylose-iodine complex \n\nTreatment Enzymatic activity (U) average \n\nControl 1600 \u00b1 300 \n\nnFe3O4 760 \u00b1 140 \n\nnFe3O4-PEG 900 \u00b1 180 \n\nSoluble-Fe 730 \u00b1 30 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 attempts to correlate the radicle length and weight to the content of Fe \n\nincorporated by the seedling tissues. Although the Fe amount in the seedling tissues was very \n\nsimilar, the biologic effects were distinct: The deleterious effects caused by 1 000 mg Fe L-1 \n\nsoluble-Fe can be attributed to phytotoxicity due the excess of this element, as previously \n\ndiscussed. However, the growth promotion induced by nFe3O4-PEG cannot be explained \n\nsolely by the content of Fe incorporated by the seedlings. Since the highest seedling growth \n\nand weight gain were observed for the nFe3O4-PEG, and this treatment did not yield the \n\nhighest ?-amylase activity, one can infer that the decomposition of starch was not the limiting \n\nfactor for the seedling development. \n\n\n\n79\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 3.16 - Correlation between radicle length and weight with the content of Fe incorporated by the \nfollowing seedling tissues: (a) and (b) cotyledon; (c) and (d) seed coat; (e) and (f) radicle \n\n       \n\n       \n\n        \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nc) d) \n\ne) f) \n\n\n\n80\t\n \u00a0\n\n3.4 Conclusions \n\nIt was previously demonstrated that Cu from CuO nanoparticles was mostly \n\nconcentrated in the seed coat of P. vulgaris seeds after soaking, especially in the hilum \n\nregion.17 In this work, X-ray microtomography and SEM have shown that Fe from magnetite \n\nnanoparticles was not only absorbed on the surface of the seed coat, but also penetrated the \n\nhilum tissue, evidence that nanoparticles do enter into the seeds. The chemical identity of the \n\nincorporated Fe was confirmed by XANES.   \n\nAltogether, the results showed that nanomaterials are potential candidates for seed \n\npriming. The deleterious effects of magnetite nanoparticles were smaller than those  \n\nshown by aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+. Thus, the supplying of nutrients through sources of intermediate \n\nsolubility makes phytotoxicity less prone to occur. Rather than only transferring nutrients to \n\nthe roots, X-ray fluorescence, XANES, SEM and tomography showed that the  \n\nnanoparticles can penetrate within the seed structure and thus modify the seedling \n\ndevelopment. Finally, the PEG coating played a major role on the properties of the magnetite \n\nnanoparticles and might be responsible for the growth promotion reported in this study.  \n\n \n\n3.5 References \n\n1 RALIYA, R. et al.

The results here presented indicate that, beyond the nanoparticle type \n\n(Cu or Fe), the priming effects on the seedling development of P. vulgaris are strongly \n\ninfluenced by the nanoparticle size, surface coverage and the applied concentration.  \n\nThe seed priming not only supplied Cu and Fe as nutrient to the seedlings, but also \n\naffected its growth. Exposing seeds to 40 nm nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and nFe3O4-PEG  \n\nat 1 000 mg Fe L-1 positively affected the seedling development after 5 days of germination, \n\nwhereas 1 000 mg Cu/Fe L-1 for the 25 nCuO and bare magnetite treatments prevented it. \n\nAlthough most of the metal oxides are virtually insoluble in water, solubility tests \n\ncarried out by XRF analysis indicated that a small amount of Cu ions were released from \n\nnCuO dispersions. Interestingly, in this case, the smaller the nanoparticle size, the greater the \n\nsolubility. Albeit ions release may occur in the soaking solution, the promotion and inhibition \n\nof the seedling development might be a consequence of the slow release of ions from the \n\noxide structure to the physiological solution during the germination process.  \n\nThe XRF results indicated that most of the incorporated Cu/Fe remains in the seed \n\ncoat, especially in the hilum region, which is the structure responsible for the water entrance \n\nduring the imbibition process. X-ray tomography complemented this data by demonstrating \n\nthat Fe from nFe3O4-PEG can penetrate within this tissue, whereas XAS and SEM-EDX \n\nconfirmed the presence of magnetite inside the hilum. XAS also unraveled that most of the Cu \n\nincorporated by the seeds soaked in nCuO dispersions remained in its pristine form, except \n\nfor the 40 nm nCuO treatment that presented in the embryo of the seeds Cu slightly reduced \n\ncompared to that found in the seed coat, an evidence that nanoparticles can be biotransformed \n\nafter seed soaking. \n\nMuch attention must be paid to the core shell effects. Differently from the others, the \n\n25 nm nCuO consisted of a metallic core made of Cu covered by oxidized layers of Cu2O and \n\nCuO, which made this treatment the most harmful to the seedling development and also the \n\nmost chemically reactive. The final disposal of that kind of nanoparticle is an environmental \n\nissue to be addressed. \n\n  \n\n\n\n88\t\n \u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, the surface chemistry modification by hydrophilic materials like \n\nPEG can be a promise way to boost seedling development. The highest radicle elongation \n\ncaused by nFe3O4-PEG might be the outcome of a higher water uptake by the seedlings \n\ntissues induced by the PEG. This coating material provided magnetite nanoparticles less \n\nreactive and less toxic to the seedlings. \n\nTherefore, depending on its physical-chemical properties, the use of CuO and \n\nmagnetite nanoparticles on seed priming can be a promise way to enhance P. vulgaris \n\ndevelopment since, in general, toxicity caused by nanoparticles was less prone to occur than \n\nby conventional soluble sources (CuSO4 and Fe3+/Fe2+).  \n\nFurther investigations are necessary once the results here presented concern only for \n\nthe early growth stages of the plant and the effects for the advanced ones still unknown. \n\nBesides that, these responses may vary according to the crops and genotypes."}]}}}
