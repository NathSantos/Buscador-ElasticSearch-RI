It is defined as an infection of bone tissue and it is an aggravated condition in \n\ndiabetic patient due to their poor blood flow and elevated blood glucose levels, which can \n\nincrease biofilm formation. In general, osteomyelitis cannot be eradicated merely by \n\nintravenous administration of antibiotics. A successful treatment will include a combination \n\nof surgical procedures, usually surgical debridement of dead infected tissue and local \n\nantibiotic therapy. Non-degradable delivery devices are currently used for local antibiotic \n\nadministration. The poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) is widely used to develop \n\ngentamicin-loaded beads that are implanted on the local of infection. Even though these \n\nbeads are routinely used to treat osteomyelitis, they present several disadvantages, including \n\nthe requirement for a second surgery to remove the beads after treatment. Hence, the use of \n\nbiodegradable devices for antibiotic delivery in osteomyelitis is a very attractive alternative. \n\nThe poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) is an enzymatically biodegradable polymer that \n\ndoes not produce acidic degradation products. In the current thesis, the suitability of PTMC \n\nto function as an antibiotic delivery device for the local treatment of osteomyelitis was \n\nexplored. Gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads were produced and their release kinetics was \n\nassessed. The inhibition of biofilm formation was also evaluated for these beads and \n\ncompared with the commercially available PMMA Septopal\u00ae beads. Additionally, the \n\nglucose influence in biofilm growth was also studied, namely medium with and without 2.6 \n\ng/L concentration of glucose was used to grow the biofilm The results showed that the mass \n\nof biofilm (Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus) increased when glucose was \n\npresent in the culture medium, which may explain the difficulties that are observed in the \n\ntreatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. The antibiotic release profile and inhibition of \n\nbiofilm formation by the PTMC beads was found to be similar to the PMMA beads. \n\nTherefore, PTMC seems a promising biodegradable carrier to be used in the local treatment \n\nof osteomyelitis. \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\nResumo \n\nA osteomielite \u00e9 uma complica\u00e7\u00e3o frequente em \u00falceras e/ou infe\u00e7\u00e3o do p\u00e9 diab\u00e9tico. \n\n\u00c9 definida como uma infec\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido \u00f3sseo, agravada em pacientes diab\u00e9ticos devido ao \n\nbaixo fluxo sangu\u00edneo e elevado n\u00edvel de glucose no sangue, o que pode contribuir para a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de biofilme. Em geral, a osteomielite n\u00e3o pode ser erradicada meramente com \n\nadministra\u00e7\u00e3o intravenosa de antibi\u00f3ticos. Um tratamento bem-sucedido inclui uma \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o de procedimentos cir\u00fargicos, geralmente remo\u00e7\u00e3o cir\u00fargica do tecido infectado \n\ne morto, seguido de terapia antibi\u00f3tica local. Dispositivos de administra\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o-\n\nbiodegrad\u00e1veis s\u00e3o actualmente utilizados para a administra\u00e7\u00e3o de antibi\u00f3ticos no local \n\ninfectado. O poli (metacrilato de metilo) (PMMA) \u00e9 amplamente utilizado para desenvolver \n\nsistemas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o controlada de antibi\u00f3ticos, e estes s\u00e3o implantados no local infetado. \n\nEmbora as part\u00edculas de PMMA sejam utilizadas com frequ\u00eancia no tratamento da \n\nosteomielite, estas apresentam v\u00e1rias desvantagens, incluindo a exig\u00eancia de uma segunda \n\ncirurgia para as remover, ap\u00f3s o tratamento. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dispositivos biodegrad\u00e1veis para \n\na liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de antibi\u00f3ticos no tratamento da osteomielite \u00e9 uma alternativa muito atraente. O \n\npoli (carbonato de trimetileno) (PTMC) \u00e9 um pol\u00edmero enzimaticamente biodegrad\u00e1vel que \n\nn\u00e3o produz produtos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cidos. No presente trabalho foi explorada a adequa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde PTMC para funcionar como um dispositivo de administra\u00e7\u00e3o de antibi\u00f3tico para o \n\ntratamento local da osteomielite. Foram produzidas part\u00edculas de PTMC carregadas com \n\ngentamicina e a cin\u00e9tica de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do antibi\u00f3tico foi avaliada. Adicionalmente, a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda forma\u00e7\u00e3o de biofilme foi estudada e comparada com as part\u00edculas de PMMA Septopal\u00ae \n\ncomercialmente dispon\u00edveis. Al\u00e9m disso, a influ\u00eancia da glucose no crescimento de biofilme \n\ntamb\u00e9m fez parte deste estudo e por conseguinte, desenvolveu-se um biofilme em meio sem \n\ne com glucose com uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 2.6 g/L Os resultados mostraram que a massa de \n\nbiofilme (Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus) aumentou na presen\u00e7a de glucose \n\nno meio de cultura, o que pode explicar a dificuldade observada no tratamento da \n\nosteomielite do p\u00e9 diab\u00e9tico. O perfil de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do antibi\u00f3tico e a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nbiofilme para as part\u00edculas de PTMC foi semelhante ao encontrado para as part\u00edculas de \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n\nPMMA. Nesse sentido, as part\u00edculas de PTMC parecem ser um transportador biodegrad\u00e1vel \n\npromissor no tratamento local de osteomielite. \n\n\n\n \n\nix \n\nList of Contents \n\nAcknowledgements iii \n\nAbstract  v \n\nResumo vii \n\nList of Contents ix \n\nList of Tables  xi \n\nList of Figures xii \n\nList of abbreviations xv \n\nScope xvi \n\nChapter 1.

INTRODUCTION \n\nDiabetes is known for its complications, it increases the risk for many serious health \n\nproblems. Diabetic foot infections are one of the most common problems in diabetic patients \n\nand they are responsible for most of amputation cases in these patients.  \n\n1.1. DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS \u2013 AETIOLOGY AND PRECIPITATING FACTORS \n\nA diabetic foot ulcer is a thick wound located below the ankle in a diabetic patient. It \n\ncommonly appears in pressure points such as plantar surfaces, metatarsal heads, heels and big \n\ntoe. This wound is characterized by a loss of epithelium that extends through the dermis \n\nreaching deeper tissues. Chronic ulcers fail to progress through an orderly and timely sequence \n\nof repair, and so heal slowly [1]. \n\nFoot ulcers are the most common cause of diabetes associated hospital admissions and \n\nthe lifetime incidence of foot ulceration is around 25 %. This condition is responsible for 85 % \n\nof major amputations in diabetic patients [2]. These patients have a 30-fold higher risk of lower \n\nlimb amputation due to infection, as compared with patients without diabetes [3]. \n\nFurthermore, diabetic foot ulcers are associate with a negative psychological and social \n\neffect on the patients namely increased family tensions, reduced social activities, limited \n\nemployment and financial burden [1].  \n\nAround half of all foot wounds will become infected during therapy which decreases the \n\nquality of life and contribute to a high morbidity and premature mortality among the diabetic \n\npatients [1].  \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\nMultiple causes contribute to diabetic foot ulceration, predominantly peripheral \n\nneuropathy and ischemia from peripheral vascular disease [4].  \n\nThe peripheral neuropathy is present in more than 80 % of diabetic patients with foot \n\ndisease, as a consequence of the metabolic disorders [5]. Neuropathy affects peripheral \n\nsensation, innervation of the small muscles of the foot and fine vasomotor control of the pedal \n\ncirculation. The motor neuropathy is characterized by the alteration of the distribution of forces \n\nduring walking leading to a reactive thickening of skin at sites of abnormal overload. \n\nFollowing, ischemic necrosis of tissues beneath the callus causes the breakdown of the skin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue, consequently forming a neuropathic ulcer (Figure 1) [6].  \n\nDiabetic patients are twice more prone to have a peripheral arterial disease, which is also \n\na key risk factor for lower extremity amputation [7]. \n\nMacrovascular (atherosclerosis) and microvascular disease might cause the foot tissues \n\nto become ischemic. The ischemic foot loses its protective sweeting, is dry, red, thin with \n\ndystrophic nails and susceptible to the pressure from a shoe or even an adjacent toe leading to \n\nthe appearance of an ischemic ulcer (Figure 2) [6].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Ischaemic diabetic foot ulcer \n(Taken from [7]). \n\nFigure 1. Neuropathic ulcer in a \n\ntypical position, i.e. under second \nmetatarsal head and surrounded by \n\ncallus (Taken from [6]). \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nNeuroischemia is the combined effect of diabetic neuropathy and ischaemia, by virtue of \n\nmacrovascular disease and in some cases, microvascular dysfunction impair perfusion in a \n\ndiabetic foot and a neuroischemic ulcer is formed (Figure 3) [7].  \n\nThe initial injury to provoke an ulcer, can be caused by acute mechanical or thermal \n\ntrauma when continuous or repetitive mechanical \n\nstress is applied [6]. \n\nImpaired wound healing is a major factor that \n\ncontributes to the augment of chronic foot ulceration \n\nand amputation. Diabetic patients have functional \n\nchanges in the microcirculation and in cellular \n\nactivity, the expression of the various growth factors \n\nand cytokines that are normally involved in tissue \n\nrepair and wound healing. A normal process of \n\nwound healing entails a complex interplay between connective tissue formation, cellular \n\nactivity and growth factor activation; however these physiological processes are altered in these \n\npatients thus preventing the ulcer to heal [8].  \n\nNosocomial infection rate has been reported to increase 2.7-fold when glucose blood \n\nlevels are above 220 mg/dL. Diabetes mellitus has been linked to the development of these \n\ninfections [9]. \n\nElevated blood glucose causes endogenous glycation leading to cellular dysfunction in \n\nsoft tissues and decreases cellular and humeral immune response [8].  \n\nPolymicrobial infections dominate diabetic foot infections and the diversity of bacterial \n\npopulations in chronic wounds appears to be important to the chronicity of wounds. The biofilm \n\nmode of growth of the infecting organism represents another obstacle to heal a chronic wound \n\n[2].  \n\nFigure 3. Neuroischemic ulcer (Taken \nfrom [7]). \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nPrevious studies reported that biofilm formation in vitro increases with increasing \n\nglucose concentrations through the accessory gene regulator (agr) pathway [8]. Cellular \n\nenvironment containing glucose and at a low pH has been found to increase biofilm formation \n\nresulting from the decreased agr expression [10]. \n\nEven though the reported data suggests that biofilm formation increases in the presence \n\nof higher glucose concentration, only few concentrations were studied in the hyperglycemic \n\nrange of 100 to 500 mg/dL and additional information about the dose response of biofilm \n\nformation to glucose levels in the clinically relevant range of 20 to 300 mg/dL, is still \n\nuncovered. The severity of anomalous glucose levels, affecting microbe pathogenicity is \n\nimportant to know specially when dealing with diabetic patients with an infected wound [8].  \n\n1.2. CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS \n\nA classification of foot ulcers is important in the selection of comparable populations for \n\nurgently needed multicenter trials. In this respect, two international working parties are trying to \n\ndefine a system that describes individual ulcers to develop a classification for audit and \n\nresearch. Even though there is no commonly accepted method for classification or description \n\nof foot ulcers yet [6]. \n\nEarly and assertive diagnostic aids in the development of a proper management plan and \n\ncan be crucial in preventing the formation of a chronical wound. There are some systems of \n\nulcer classification based on a variety of physical findings such as size, depth, appearance and \n\nlocation. The classification system of Wagner Ulcer (Table 1) is the most well-known being \n\nbased on wound depth and the extent of tissue necrosis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTable 1.

With increasing grade and stage of the \n\nwound, the difficulty to heal increases and vascular repair or amputation might be needed [4]. \n\nTable 2.

CLASSIFICATION OF INFECTION \n\nWhen an ulcer is formed, interior tissues are exposed to bacterial colonization, which \n\ncan lead to an infection and this infection can further reach deeper tissues [11].  \n\nAn infected ulcer must be diagnosed clinically when purulent secretions are present or at \n\nleast 2 of the cardinal manifestations of inflammation are observed. An early diagnose and \n\ncuring of the infection often contributes to healing of the ulcer [12]. \n\nOnce an infection is installed, it typically takes the form of cellulitis, deep-skin and soft-\n\ntissue infections, acute osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis. \n\nCellulitis is defined as an acute infection of the skin involving the subcutaneous tissues. \n\nClinically it is characterized by erythema (>2cm in diameter) in association with purulent \n\ndischarge, with or without lymphangitis. The diagnostic is generally based on the morphologic \n\nfeatures of the lesion and the clinical setting. If drainage or an open wound is present, most \n\nprobably there is an infection. The infection may be caused by indigenous flora colonizing skin \n\nand appendages as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, or by a wide variety of \n\nexogenous bacteria [13,14]. \n\nSkin and soft-tissue infections are defined as a suppurative microbial invasion of the \n\nepidermis and subcutaneous tissues that induce either a local or systemic host response. This \n\ntype of infections are characterized by induration, erythema, warmth and pain or tenderness and \n\nrange from mild self-limiting furunculosis to life threatening necrotizing fasciitis [15, 16].  \n\nOsteomyelitis (OM) derivate from Greek words: osteon, myelos and itis and it refers to \n\nthe infection of the bone and bone marrow. Even though bone is normally resistant to bacterial \n\ncolonization, some events as trauma, surgery or prosthesis may disrupt the bone and lead to an \n\ninfection [17]. \n\nDiagnosing osteomyelitis in a diabetic patient with a foot infections is difficult, \n\ntherefore it is frequently missed and underdiagnosed [5]. Undiagnosed and untreated OM often \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nleads to limb amputation; the risk for amputation in acute diabetic infections is four times \n\nhigher with OM than with soft tissue infection alone. Furthermore, the presence of OM requires \n\na longer duration of antibiotic therapy and a longer duration of hospital stay, thereby raising the \n\nhospitalization costs [18]. \n\nOM can be found in 15 % of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, and in 20 % of patients \n\nwith diabetic foot infections. The risk of developing OM is higher at the presence of ulcers \n\nlarger than 2 cm\n2\n or a diabetic foot ulcer with exposed bone or joint [18]. Although efforts have \n\nbeen made to reduce incidence and consequences of OM, there is still a large proportion of the \n\nworld population suffering from chronic OM, due to a vast increase in reconstructive orthopedic \n\nprocedures and higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, together with longer life-expectancies \n\n[19].  \n\nThe most common sites of OM are in the forefoot (90 %) followed by the midfoot (5 %) \n\nand hindfoot (5 %). The bones usually more involved are the weight-bearing bones of the foot, \n\nparticularly to what it is referred as the \u2018tripod of the foot\u2019 that includes the first metatarsal \n\nhead, fifth metatarsal head, and the calcaneum [18]. \n\nHistologically, OM is characterized by the \n\npresence of leukocytes or inflammatory cells, such as \n\nlymphocytes and plasma cells, and by the presence of \n\nbone necrosis (Figure 4).  \n\nAn inadequate treatment of the acute phase \n\npermits OM to persist and become chronic or \n\n\u201cdormant\u201d for a considerable period of time, only to \n\nmanifest again at a later stage [19]. \n\nOM can be classified according to duration (acute or chronic), pathogenesis (trauma, \n\ncontiguous spread, hematogenous, surgical), site, extent or type of patient. Although several \n\nclassifications of OM have been described by different authors, the classification of Cierny and \n\nFigure 4. Infected ulceration and osteomyelitis \n\n(Taken from [39]). \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nMader is one of the most widely used. Under this system, OM is classified according to the \n\nanatomic involvement of the infected bone, in four types [20]:  \n\nType 1 \u2013 Medullary OM, infection confined to the medullary cavity of the bone; \n\nType 2 \u2013 Superficial OM, involves only the cortical bone and often originates from a \n\ndirect inoculation or a contagious focus infection; \n\nType 3 \u2013 Localized OM, the infectious process does not involve the entire bone \n\ndiameter; \n\nType 4 \u2013 Diffuse OM, involves the entire thickness of the bone characterized for loss of \n\nstability. \n\nOM of the foot is a very serious and common problem in diabetic patient and a high \n\nindex of clinical suspicion is required for diagnosis [5]. \n\n1.4. OSTEOMYELITIS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \n\nThe pathophysiology of chronic OM is multifactorial beginning with the spread of \n\nbacteria that can reach the bone by hematogenous seeding, followed by direct inoculation, or \n\nairborne contamination [21]. Whatever the route of access, bacteria must be able to \n\nsubsequently adhere to components of the bone matrix in order to start the infection [22]. \n\nThe most common pathogens responsible for OM are the Staphylococcus species, \n\nfollowed by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. S. aureus is the main causative \n\nstrain of chronic bacterial OM and around 90 % cases of OM associated with implants are \n\ncaused by S. epidermidis [22]. \n\nSuperficial fungal skin infections are common in diabetic patients, contributing to the \n\nentry of bacteria through macerated or broken skin. Furthermore, these patients have a high rate \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nof nasal and skin colonization with S. aureus, who is more likely to be present on the skin and \n\ntake advantage of any disruptions [5]. \n\nS. aureus is known for its capacity to bind fibrinogen which can provide an explanation \n\nfor this microorganism ability to survive in body fluids. Bacteria clump together and are \n\ncovered in a layer of fibrinogen, hence protected from the host defense mechanisms and \n\nantibiotics [22].  \n\nDiabetic foot infections are mostly polymicrobial with mixed gram-positive and gram-\n\nnegative bacteria, of both aerobic and anaerobic types [21].  \n\nOnce bacteria are in contact with the bone and/or implant it may use different \n\nmechanisms to facilitate cell-cell and/or cell-implant adhesion. Bacteria become sessile, reduce \n\ntheir metabolic rate, and produce a biofilm that protects them from antimicrobials, opsonization \n\nand phagocytosis [21].  \n\nBiofilm is defined as a multistage process in which microbial cells adhere to a surface or \n\nto the surface of other organisms (initial reversible attachment), with subsequent production of \n\nan extracellular matrix that contains polysaccharides, proteins and DNA (extracellular \n\npolymeric substance \u2013 EPS) [2]. Cells embedded in this matrix, also referred to as \u2018slime\u2019, \n\ncommunicate with each other and show a coordinated group behavior. The biofilm cells are \n\nphenotypically and physiologically different from non-adhered (planktonic) cells. One of their \n\ntypical properties is the increased resistance to antimicrobial agents [23].  \n\nAn estimated 65-80 % of all infections is thought to be biofilm-related, being the \n\nbiofilm formation often considered as the underlying reason why the treatment with \n\nantimicrobial agents fails [23] since the embedded organisms are extensively protected by their \n\nslimy layer [19]. \n\nThe protective mechanism found in a biofilm appears to be distinct from the \n\nmechanisms responsible for conventional antibiotic resistance, making biofilm bacteria 800-\n\nfold less susceptible to antibiotics than the planktonic ones [19]. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n1.5. TREATMENT OF OSTEOMYELITIS \n\nIn the early 1900s, around 20 % of patients suffering from OM died, while the survivors \n\nremained with significant morbidity. Nowadays, the mortality and morbidity of these patients is \n\nlower due to surgical treatment together with prolonged antibiotic treatment [24].  \n\nA successful treatment of OM in the diabetic foot is a combination of antibiotic therapy \n\nand surgical procedures. A surgical intervention is almost always required due to the impaired \n\nblood supply of the affected regions and the low ability of the host immune system to clear \n\ninfections [21]. The procedure includes surgical debridement, drainage of pus, excision of the \n\nosteomyelitic bone and/or minor amputations. Debridement is essential and is often the first \n\nfactor in the elimination of an infection [24].  \n\nIn addition, stabilization of the foot is also an important factor in the surgical \n\nmanagement, since debridement often causes a large dead space that needs to be managed \n\neffectively to prevent the infection to resurge. The dead space management includes closed \n\nirrigation systems, local soft tissue flaps, vascularized free flaps, as a variety of methods for \n\nlocal antibiotic delivery [21].  \n\nChronic OM cannot be eradicated alone by intravenous administration of antibiotics, \n\nsince the infected necrotic focus in the bone, is usually surrounded by sclerotic avascular bone, \n\nwhich is almost unreachable using systemic antibiotics. Also, the necrotic bone is a suitable \n\nsubstrate for biofilm formation, reducing the antibiotic sensitivity of the infecting pathogens \n\nand making the infection difficult to treat [25]. \n\nLocal delivery of antibiotics is a novel therapeutic procedure in chronic OM, allowing \n\nhigh antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection without systemic antibiotic toxicity [24], \n\n[19]. \n\nAntibiotics incorporated in local delivery systems have shown broad and sufficient \n\nantibacterial efficacy. The requirements of these antibiotics are that they must be heat stable and \n\nhydrophilic [21]. Aminoglycosides in general, mainly gentamicin, are preferred antibiotics from \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nbacteriological and physico chemical point of view. Nevertheless, the increasing gentamicin \n\nresistance of staphylococci in bone infections requires the use of a different antibiotic. \n\nVancomycin is the antibiotic used as last resort for the treatment of clinically resistant \n\nbacteria, like methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [26].  \n\nLOCAL ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY  \n\nGentamicin-loaded bone cement beads were first created by Klemm in 1979 and these \n\nwere used to fill the dead space after debridement of dead bone with a successful cure rate of \n\n91,4% in more than 100 patients [21]. \n\nSystemic therapy has been left behind due to the numerous advantages achieved with \n\nthe use of antibiotic-loaded beads. These beads are placed by a simple procedure and usually \n\nperformed at time of the initial debridement of chronic OM or open fracture [21].  \n\nCurrently, the standard procedure of OM treatment includes the traditional systemic \n\nantibiotic regimes associated with implant removal and/or tissue debridement, and bone void \n\nfillers absorbed with antibiotics, antibiotic-infused collagen sponges, or antibiotic-loaded bone \n\ncement [27]. Drawbacks of these systems are the fact that they require a second surgery for \n\nremoval [21] and/or, they lack in controlled pharmaceutical release strategies needed for an \n\neffective local dosing and duration. Low and short antibiotic release can boost the development \n\nof antibiotic resistance and persistence infection [27]. \n\nIn order to achieve the therapeutic drug concentrations in the infected area, high \n\nsystemic doses are needed which can further worsen toxic side effects. Nonetheless, normal \n\ndoses of systemic antibiotics may not be enough to breach the glycocalyx of the biofilm \n\nproduced by the infecting bacteria [28]. \n\nThe selection of the appropriate antibiotic has to be made by understanding the \n\nmicrobiology of bone and soft tissue infections [28]. Antimicrobial agents used in local delivery \n\nsystems should present specific features such as available solid dosage form; wide bacterial \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nspectrum; bactericidal potency low concentrations; elution from carrier in high concentrations \n\nfor prolonged periods; low/no risk of allergy or delayed hypersensitivity; low influence on the \n\nmechanical properties of the carrier; and low drug serum protein binding [24], [27]. \n\nFurthermore, an ideal local antibiotic device system must provide reliable pathogen \n\nkilling via immediate burst release within the first 24 hour period after administration, followed \n\nby sustained drug release above the tissue bed\u2019s minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to \n\naddress the remaining microbial threat [27].  \n\nSeveral antibiotic\u2013releasing systems are currently marketed as bone void fillers, they \n\nrelease antibiotic over short periods of time  and may degrade quickly [27].  \n\nEven though the ideal local antibiotic delivery system has not been discovered yet, a \n\nselection of very promising materials is currently in place. Table 1 lists the most successful \n\ncarriers for the release of antibiotics according to the dosage prescribed [28]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 3.

NON-BIODEGRADABLE ANTIBIOTIC DELIVERY SYSTEMS: PMMA BASED \n\nThe poly(methyl methacrylate) (IUPAC name) also designated as PMMA is a non-\n\nbiodegradable and biocompatible polymer. It is a synthetic homopolymer of methyl \n\nmethacrylate monomer (MMA) (Figure 5), classified as hard, rigid, but brittle material, with a \n\nglass transition temperature of 105 \u00b0C [29].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe PMMA polymer is considered hydrophobic although it can become slightly \n\nhydrophilic when in contact with water as indicated by a decrease in the contact angle and a \n\npronounced contact angle hysteresis. It is currently accepted as a non-toxic polymer with a very \n\ngood toxicological safety record in biomedical applications and without references to severe \n\nadverse effects [29]. \n\nPMMA was first used by Charnley in 1958 to anchor joint replacements; it is commonly \n\ncalled bone cement and it is often used in orthopedics [19]. This polymer has the ability to \n\nsuccessfully consolidate implants in bone in a handler and host-friendly manner, with limited \n\nadverse and rare allergic reactions [19]. \n\nSince 1970, PMMA has been used as a local delivery system of antibiotics in two \n\ndifferent ways, namely as antibiotic-loaded bone cement applied in joint replacements and \n\nchains of antibiotic-loaded beads for musculoskeletal infections [29]. \n\nFigure 5. Chemical structure of the repeating unit of  poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer (Taken \n\nfrom [29]). \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nThe first applications of PMMA as a particulate carrier material were on the \n\ndevelopment of nanoparticles for vaccination purposes and on beads to fill defects related to \n\nsurgical resection of chronic OM [29].  \n\nAntibiotics most commonly used have been the aminoglycosides; gentamicin or \n\ntobramycin. Even though its use as a drug particulate carrier system has been somehow \n\nneglected due to the fact that it is (bio)inert and non-biodegradable, this polymer is still an \n\neligible candidate as biomedical material because of its biocompatibility [29].  \n\nThe selection of the antibiotic to be used in PMMA must be carefully considered since it \n\nhas to present chemical and heat stability, since PMMA polymerization often reaches 80\u00b0C, and \n\nit has also to be able to diffuse through the pores of the polymer providing a local concentration \n\nthat exceeds the MIC for the infecting organisms [30]. Additionally, the antibiotic must be \n\navailable in the powder form since liquid antibiotics weaken the cement matrix and finally, it \n\nhas to be water-soluble and hydrophilic to potentiate the release [19]. \n\nGentamicin sulfate is the antibiotic most commonly used; it is an excellent additive to \n\nPMMA due to its broad spectrum of action, bactericidal properties, low rate of primarily \n\nresistant pathogens and good thermostability. Vancomycin and tobramycin are also eligible \n\noptions, they are both water soluble and available in powder form [21]. Nevertheless the use of \n\nvancomycin in non-biodegradable carriers is limited, especially in bone cement applications \n\nbecause it shows poor release due to the antibiotic high molecular weight [26]. \n\nAntibiotic release from bone cement will depend on how the body fluid is capable of \n\nreaching the regions of the cement matrix. In the first hours or days after implantation it is \n\nobserved a burst release, since the antibiotic at the cement surface is easily available. The \n\ndissolution fluid penetrates the bone cement dissolving the antibiotic within superficial regions, \n\nwhile the interior usually remains unreached [30]. Often, only 10 % of the total amount of \n\nantibiotic incorporated is released from bone cement [19].  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n1.7. PMMA CARRIERS TO TREAT OSTEOMYELITIS \n\nPMMA can be used in the treatment of OM as chains of beads or spacers [19].  \n\nBeads of PMMA can be used for all kinds of chronic OM and are commercially \n\navailable as chains of gentamicin-loaded PMMA spheres (Septopal\u00ae) or handmade from \n\ncommercially available antibiotic-loaded bone cement [19].  \n\nAlthough PMMA beads are frequently used for OM, they are not specialized in the \n\ntherapy of resistant infections, presenting restrictions mainly regarding the use of various \n\nantibiotics [19]. Septopal\u00ae beads demonstrate a good antibiotic release due to a porous cement \n\nmatrix and the addition of glycin yielding gentamicin tissue levels above MIC for non-resistant \n\nbacterial strains, for 30 days. These beads are routinely used to treat OM with no regard about \n\nthe infecting bacterial strains that are present or their sensitivity to gentamicin. The augmenting \n\nof gentamicin-resistant staphylococci related with the use of PMMA beads has been raising \n\nconcerns about the choice of such therapeutics. Another disadvantage of PMMA beads is the \n\nfact that they can provide a substratum for bacterial colonization, mainly because the amount of \n\nantibiotic release decreases over time thus becoming ineffective [19].  \n\nThe major drawback of PMMA beads is the need for a second surgical procedure to \n\nremove the beads after treatment, since the polymer is non-biodegradable [21], [25]. \n\nAdditionally, the beads do not release all of their antibiotic content, reportedly after 2 weeks in \n\nsitu, only 20-70 % of the total amount of gentamicin loaded is released and the concentration of \n\nthe antibiotic drops considerably afterwards [25].  \n\nThe PMMA spacers are a temporary implant to maintain the joint space and soft-tissue \n\ntension, besides being used in joint replacement infections. They decrease the morbidity and the \n\nimplantation of a new prosthesis, during the second surgery, is less complicated. for the patient \n\n[19]. \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe spacer can be modified by using commercially available mould kits. This enables \n\nthe clinicians to alter the antibiotic composition and dosage according to the size of the implant \n\n[19].  \n\nThe advantages of this method are the immediate treatment of the source of infection, \n\nreaching high antibiotic levels locally; maintenance of joint mobility; limitation of scar \n\nformation; absence of soft tissue contraction and easy re-implantation [31]. However, the \n\nantibiotic sustained release from the spacers is lower when compared to the beads, due to their \n\nlower surface area [19]. \n\nThe use of low-dose antibiotic bone cement for handmade spacers or beads results in a \n\nsub-therapeutic antibiotic release that can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. \n\nOn the other hand, the addition of more than 10 % of antibiotic in PMMA weakens significantly \n\nthe weight-baring carrier and the toxicity risk increases when the overall antibiotic loading is \n\ntoo high [32]. Furthermore, unpredictable release rates are expected when there is an uneven \n\ndistribution of the antibiotic and a variable surface area [19]. \n\nBIODEGRADABLE ANTIBIOTIC DELIVERY SYSTEMS: PTMC BASED  \n\nThe use of biodegradable devices as antibiotic carriers to treat OM is very appealing \n\nsince these carriers are able to fulfill the dead space result ing from the surgical debridement \n\nand, more importantly, they release all their entire antibiotic content and a second surgical \n\nremoval after treatment is not required [26], [19]. \n\nThe most frequently investigated biodegradable antibiotic carriers are the poly(lactic \n\nacid) (PLA) and/or poly(glycolic acid) (PGA). However, the use of these polymers as bone \n\nimplants are controversial due to the bone resorption, that can occur as a result of a decrease in \n\npH while the polymer degrades [26]. Further, some studies have reported an inflammatory \n\nforeign-body reaction, related with PLA and PGA implants [25]. Therefore, these polymers are \n\nnot ideal for the local treatment of bone infections. Carriers that do not produce acidic \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\ndegradation products are highly preferable. This requirement is satisfied with the biodegradable \n\npoly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) [26]. \n\nPTMC (Figure 6) is a resorbable, amorphous and flexible polymer with a glass transition \n\ntemperature of approximately -17 \u00b0C. Also, it degrades in water, CO2 and propanediol, and it is \n\na relatively new polymer in biomedical applications [26], [33]. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Chemical structure of poly(trimethylene carbonate) (Taken from [34]). \n\nThe degradation of PTMC in vitro at pH 7 and 37 \u00b0C is quite low compared to the in \n\nvivo degradation, thus suggesting enzymatic involvement [25, 26]. In fact, enzymes play an \n\nimportant role in the in vivo degradation which can be simulated in vitro by the use of a lipase \n\nsolution. PTMC hardly degrades in vitro without the presence of lipase and it is known also to \n\nbe susceptible to cholesterol esterase [26], [35].  \n\nPTMC degrades enzymatically in a uniform manner by surface erosion providing \n\nsustained high antibiotic release rates [25]. Enzymatic surface erosion by cholesterol esterase \n\nand superoxide anion radicals, mediated by macrophages, was only recently reported and \n\nPTMC appears to degrade completely in bone and assist in promoting bone regeneration [19], \n\n[25]. \n\nIn vitro data suggests that molecular weight of PTMC can be adjusted to control the \n\nrelease rate of various antibiotics with an ideal and sustained, zero order release profile [19]. \n\nThe in vivo degradation behavior of PTMC seems to be molecular weight dependent, as \n\nthe degradation has been found to occur faster in PTMC with higher molecular weights [26], \n\n[35],[36]. This result can be due to the greater hydrophilicity of the lower molecular weight \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nafter aqueous conditioning, which might induce conformational changes on the enzyme when \n\nabsorbed at PTMC interface, reducing its activity [35].  \n\nAnother possible explanation is the oxidation of PTMC as the primary in vivo \n\ndegradation mechanism. Oxidative degradation occurs as a frustrated phagocytosis when \n\nmacrophages attach to the material surface and secrete reactive oxygen species. Among these, \n\nsuperoxide anion is believed to be responsible for the in vivo oxidative degradation of PTMC. \n\nThe third explanation proposed is the fact that macrophages preferentially attach to, or are more \n\nactive on, PTMC with molecular weights greater than 100 Kg/mol [35]. \n\nIn short, PTMC appears to be a promising biodegradable carrier in the local treatment of \n\nOM presenting good biocompatibility and the ability to degrade in a uniform manner potentially \n\nreleasing all its antibiotic content. Finally, due to its surface erosion, PTMC is not expected to \n\nlimit the release of high molecular weight drugs [25, 26]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nChapter 2.

The gentamicin release profile of Septopal beads was determined and they \n\nwere used for anti-biofilm efficacy test. \n\n2.3. GENTAMICIN LOADED PTMC BEADS \n\nHigh purity, polymerization grade 1,3 \u2013 trimethylene carbonate was purchased from \n\nMedisse (Medisse BV, Ede, The Netherlands) and was used to prepare poly(trimethylene \n\ncarbonate) (PTMC) polymer with MW 556 g/mol and Mn 439 g/mol.  \n\nPTMC polymer, 1 g, was dissolved in 38 mL of tetrahydrofuran (purchased from Merck, \n\nDarmstadt, Germany, used as received) under magnetic stirring at 250 rpm for 24 h. \n\nSeptopal PMMA bead contains 2.8 mg of gentamicin sulfate, the weight of one PTMC \n\nbead is approximately 52 mg which corresponds to 5 % of gentamicin content in each bead.  \n\nTo the dissolved polymer 0.055 g of gentamicin sulfate (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, \n\nSt. Louis, USA) was added, in order to create PTMC beads with the same gentamicin content as \n\nPMMA beads. After gentamicin addition the solution was mixed for 5 min in ultrasonic bath \n\nfollowed by magnetic stirring for 24 h. \n\nThe solution containing the antibiotic dispersion was precipitated into 400 mL of \n\nanhydrous hexane (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, \n\nUSA, used as received). Once PTMC and gentamicin sulfate \n\ndo not dissolve in hexane, this induces precipitation of the \n\npolymer - through which gentamicin is homogeneously \n\ndistributed. The composite was then collected and dried under \n\nvacuum at room temperature in a Heraus oven (Jott. Wilten- \n\nUtrecht N.V.) \n\nFigure 7. Stainless steel molds \n\nused to prepare PTMC beads. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nPTMC beads with dispersed antibiotic particles incorporated were prepared by \n\ncompression-molded at 70 \u00baC, using a stainless steel molds (see Figure 7) and a laboratory press \n\n(Carver Inc., Wabash, IN, USA). From this procedure were created 10 PTMC beads loaded \n\nwith 5 % of gentamicin. \n\nPTMC beads with 7.5 % of gentamicin and without antibiotic were also made following \n\nthe previous procedure. \n\n2.4. RELEASE OF GENTAMICIN \n\nEnzymes seem to play an important role in in vivo degradation of PTMC which can be \n\nsimulated in vitro by the use of a lipase solution. Cholesterol esterase is one of the enzymes \n\nresponsible for in vivo degradation.  \n\nGentamicin release was determined at 37 \u00baC in lipase solution from \n\nThermomyceslanuginosus (EC 3.1.1.3., minimum 100.0 units/g, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, \n\nused as received) and in cholesterol esterase from porcine pancreas (minimum 30.9 units/mg, \n\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich, diluted to a final concentration of 1 U/mL).  \n\nGentamicin-loaded PTMC beads (n=3) were immersed in 5 mL of lipase or cholesterol \n\nesterase solution and incubated at 37 \u00baC under 150 rpm stirring (shaker incubator Innova 4000, \n\nNew Brunswick scientific) for 2 weeks. Liquid samples of 1mL were taken every 24 h and then \n\nstored at 4 \u00baC before analysis. After taking the sample the entire solution medium was replaced. \n\nThis procedure was done to 5 % and 7.5 % gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads in lipase solution.  \n\nThe release of PTMC beads 7.5 % gentamicin loaded was also performed in cholesterol \n\nesterase solution in order to compare to the release in lipase solution.  \n\nFor comparison, the gentamicin release from PMMA (n=3) was determined in \n\npotassium phosphate buffer (PBS).  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nGentamicin concentrations in lipase or cholesterol esterase solution could not be \n\ndetermined spectrophotometrically due to interference of the enzyme. An indirect \n\nbacterialinhibition assay was used to determine gentamicin concentrations in these samples. The \n\nsame process was used to determine gentamicin release from PMMA beads. \n\nPre-culture of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 was incubated for 24 h, this species is highly \n\nsensitive to gentamicin. The pre-culture was smeared on nine TSB agar plates with a cotton \n\nswab.  \n\nGentamicin stock solution with a concentration of 5 mg/mL was made out of 0.005 g of \n\ngentamicin diluted in 10 mL of PBS. The stock solution was diluted 10 times for a solution with \n\n500 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin concentration. This last solution was diluted 2 times to obtain a solution \n\nwith 250 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin concentration and this was sequentially repeated until a \n\nconcentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL. From each known gentamicin concentration solutions 15 \u00b5gL was \n\ndropped on TSB agar plates, and the plates were incubated for 24 h. The antibiotic inhibits \n\nbacteria growth during incubation which resulted in zones of inhibition. The areas of the \n\ninhibition were clear around the position of the samples droplets, the diameter was measured in \n\ntwo perpendicular directions and a calibration curve was made. \n\nThe previous procedure was repeated with the samples taken from PTMC in lipase and \n\ncholesterol esterase solution, also for PMMA beads in PBS. Gentamicin concentration in each \n\nsample was deduced by comparison with the inhibition zones corresponding to the known \n\ngentamicin concentrations and using the calibration curve. \n\n2.5. MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION AND GROWTH CURVES \n\nGentamicin sensitivity of each clinically isolated strains was evaluated with Etest\u00ae \n\n(purchased from bioM\u00e9rieux, USA, used as received). \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nIn 5 TSB agar plates each diluted pre-culture (24 h of incubation at 37 \u00baC) was smeared \n\nand the Etest was then placed in the middle of each plate. The plates were incubated for 24 h \n\nand MIC value was measured afterwards. \n\nThe species S. aureus, E. cloacae, S. epidermidis were sensitive to gentamicin (MIC-\n\nvalue below 4 \u00b5g/mL) and therefore selected to be used throughout this work.  \n\nIn this study, it was also our intention to test the influence of glucose on biofilm growth \n\nsince diabetic patients have elevated blood glucose levels.  \n\nNutrient broth glucose free medium (10 mL) was used for pre-culture of each selected \n\nspecies and after 24 h of incubation they were seeded in NB agar plates and in NB agar plates \n\nwith 2.6 g/L of glucose, a clinically relevant concentration. New Etest was performed to test if \n\ngentamicin sensitivity of this species was affected by the presence of glucose. \n\nGrowth curves of planktonic bacteria were created to assess the glucose influence on \n\nbacterial growth. Pre-cultures of the 3 species were made in 10 mL of NB medium for 24 h of \n\nincubation.  \n\nIn sterile containers (Greiner, NL), 500 \u00b5L of each pre-culture was added to 22.5 mL of \n\nNB medium and NB medium with 2.6 g/L of glucose. The solutions were stored in the stirring \n\nincubator (Shaker incubator Innova 4000, New Brunswick scientific, 37 \u00baC, 150 rpm) and the \n\nabsorbance was measured at the wavelength of 600 nm in spectrophotometer (Spectronic \n\nInstruments, Beun, DeRonde, Abcoude) at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 23, 25, 26, 27 h. \n\n2.6. BIOFILM GROWTH \n\nAfter testing the glucose influence on planktonic bacteria this effect was tested in \n\nbiofilm growth.  \n\nIn 96-well plates with flat bottom (microtest tissue culture plate, Becton Dickinson \n\nLabware, USA), 200 \u00b5L of diluted pre-cultures were seeded and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 1 h. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nWells were washed with buffer and 200 \u00b5L of NB medium with 2.6 g/L glucose and without \n\nglucose was added. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00baC for 24 h and 48 h (medium was refreshed \n\nafter 24 h). The medium was removed and the wells were gently washed 3 times with 200 \u00b5L of \n\nPBS. Each well was stained with 200 \u00b5L of 1 % crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. \n\nAfter staining, the plates were gently rinsed 3 times with demineralized water. Quantitative \n\nanalysis of biofilm formation was performed by adding 200 \u00b5L of ethanol/acetone (80:20) to \n\nsolubilize the crystal violet. The absorbance of this solution was measured using a FLUOstar \n\nOptima plate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 575 nm. \n\nThe absorbance is proportional to the amount of crystal violet, which is directly proportional to \n\nthe amount of biofilm growth in each well. This procedure was done to 24 and 48 h plates. \n\nCrystal violet stains the living and dead bacterial and also the slime of the biofilm, to \n\nmeasure only the living bacteria present in the biofilm, a metabolic activity assay (MTT \n\nstaining) was performed after 24 and 48 h. After seeding 200 \u00b5L of pre-cultures for 1 h in the \n\n96-well plate the supernatant was removed from the wells and these were washed with 200 \u00b5L \n\nof PBS. Biofilms were stained with 200 \u00b5L of MTT solution for 1 h at 37 \u00baC in the dark. MTT \n\nsolution was previously made with 10mL of PBS, 0.005 g of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-\n\nyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, Sigma Aldrich St. Louis, USA), 0.100 g glucose \n\nmonohydrate (purchased from Merck, Darmstadt) and 100 \u00b5L of menadione. The wells were \n\nwashed with 200 \u00b5L of demineralized water and MTT was solubilized in 200 \u00b5L of acid \n\nisopropanol (5 %, 1 M, purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, used as received). The \n\nabsorbance was measured using a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, \n\nOffenburg, Germany) at the wavelength of 575 nm. \n\n2.7. BIOFILM MODEL \n\nA biofilm model was developed to evaluate gentamicin concentration necessary to \n\nprevent biofilm growth and to treat the biofilm. Also, the influence of glucose on gentamicin \n\nsensitivity was studied. \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nS. epidermidis has a MIC value in NB medium lower than the value that is possible to \n\nmeasure in Etest. Also, the MTT or crystal violet stain results from the biofilm growth of this \n\nspecies were inconclusive so we did not proceed with this strain to further develop the biofilm \n\nmodel. Therefore, the biofilm model was developed with S. aureus and E. cloacae. \n\n2.7.1. PREVENT BIOFILM \n\nFor the prevention of biofilm growth, 1 mL of pre-cultures of S. aureus and E. cloacae \n\nwere seeded for 1 h at 37 \u00baC in 6-well plates with flat bottom (culture multiwell plate, Sigma-\n\nAldrich, St. Louis, USA).  \n\nA gentamicin stock solution of 1000 \u00b5g/mL was previously made with 0.02 g of \n\ngentamicin and 20 mL of NB medium with 2.6 g/L glucose and without glucose, this solution \n\nwas diluted to make solutions with the concentration of 5 and 10 \u00b5g/mL. \n\nPre-cultures were removed from the wells and gentamicin solutions (with and without \n\nglucose) were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 24 h. For the control wells \n\nonly medium with and without glucose was added. After incubation, the number of bacteria in \n\nthe biofilm was determined by CFU counts (serial dilutions and plate counting). Gentamicin \n\nsolutions were removed from these wells and they were gently washed with 2 mL of PBS, then \n\n1 mL of PBS was added and the bottom of the wells were scraped with a cell scraper. From the \n\nwells 400 \u00b5L of solution was removed, stored in Eppendorf\u00b4s and diluted according to Figure 8. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n2.7.2. BIOFILMS TREATMENT \n\nGentamicin solutions of 500 \u00b5g/mL and 1000 \u00b5g/mL in NB medium with and without \n\nglucose were made using a previously prepared stock solution. Diluted pre-cultures were seeded \n\nin 6-well plates for 1 h (37 \u00baC), medium with and without glucose was added and then plates \n\nwere incubated. After 24 h of biofilm growth, the medium was removed and gentamicin \n\nsolutions were added for a 24 h treatment.  \n\nThe treatment was also performed for a 48 h old biofilm, so the medium from these \n\nplates was refreshed after 24 h and the same procedure described above was made. Control \n\nwells containing only medium with and without glucose were used. \n\nThe number of bacteria was determined by CFU count with the same dilution scheme as \n\nthe one illustrated in Figure 8. \n\nFigure 8. Serial dilutions: A- Control wells; B- Gentamicin concentration 5 and 10 \u00b5g/mL wells \n(Adapted from [39]). \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n2.8. ANTI-BIOFILM EFFICACY \n\nAfter establishing the biofilm model, the anti-biofilm efficacy was evaluated. The \n\nprevention and treatment of biofilm were tested once again, but the gentamicin solutions were \n\nreplaced with gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads and Septopal PMMA beads. \n\n2.8.1. PREVENTION OF BIOFILM GROWTH \n\nFor the prevention of biofilm growth model, we used gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads \n\nand PTMC beads with no gentamicin content, were used as control.  \n\nThe results of the release profile of loaded PTMC beads in cholesterol esterase, showed \n\nthat one bead releases 585 \u00b5g of gentamicin in cholesterol esterase solution. In order to have a \n\ngentamicin concentration of 7.5 \u00b5g/mL approximately, 226.5 \u00b5L of cholesterol esterase was \n\nadded to 78 mL of NB medium with and without glucose in sterile bottles. After 24 h of stirring \n\nincubation (37 \u00baC, 150 rpm), the content of the bottles was removed and stored at 4 \u00baC for \n\nfurther use. \n\nIn 12-well plates with flat bottom (culture multi-well plate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, \n\nUSA) pre-cultures were seeded for 1 h. After removing the pre-cultures 2 mL of previously \n\nstored solutions were added to each well and plates were incubated for 24 h.  \n\nBiofilm was scraped from the bottom of the wells and the number of bacteria was \n\ndetermined by CFU count as previously described and confocal laser scanning microscopy \n\nimages were taken. \n\n2.8.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILMS \n\nAfter 1 h of incubation of pre-cultures in 12-well plates, 1 gentamicin-loaded PTMC \n\nbead was placed in the well and 2 mL of cholesterol esterase solution (1 U/mL) in NB medium \n\nwith and without glucose (2.6 g/L) was added. The same procedure was made with PMMA \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nbeads, although cholesterol esterase solution was replaced by NB medium with and without \n\nglucose.  \n\nAfter 24 h and 48 h of treatment, the biofilm was scraped from the bottom of the wells \n\nand the number of bacteria was determined by CFU count as previously described. \n\n2.9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS \n\nDue to time restrictions and limited availability of materials for the development of the \n\ncurrent work, only the gentamicin release profiles from PTMC and PMMA beads were \n\ndetermined in triplicate. \n\nA confidence level of 95 % interval was applied for statistical significance and student's \n\nt-test for independent samples was used. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nChapter 3. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nIn this chapter the results are presented and discussed, namely the gentamicin release \n\nprofile from PMMA Septopal\u00ae beads and its comparison with the release profile of the \n\nproduced PTMC beads, with different gentamicin concentrations and erosion mediums. \n\nThe results related to the biofilm model developed are also provided, for the treatment \n\nand prevention of biofilm formation with different gentamicin concentrations and at last, the \n\nanti-biofilm efficacy using the PTMC and PMMA beads for treatment and prevention of \n\nbiofilm formation.  \n\n3.1. RELEASE PROFILE FROM PTMC VERSUS PMMA BEADS \n\nPMMA beads constitute an effective drug delivery system for local antibiotic therapy in \n\nbone infection. However, after high initial gentamicin concentration release at the site of \n\ninfection (approximately 2 weeks), this concentration drops considerably. Therefore, the \n\nefficacy of gentamicin is observed immediately after implantation of the beads [25]. \n\nPTMC degrades very slowly by hydrolysis in vitro, however in vivo the degradation of \n\nPTMC subcutaneously implanted was found to be very fast. This difference suggests that \n\nenzymes are involved in the degradation process [25]. PTMC is well-known for its \n\nsusceptibility to lipase and cholesterol [33]. \n\nPrevious studies attempted to mimic the in vivo enzymatic degradation of PTMC using \n\nlipase solutions. In the presence of lipase, PTMC degrades by surface erosion which is \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\naccompanied by a high rate of antibiotic release and has been found to be similar to the \n\nobserved for Septopal\u00ae PMMA beads [26]. \n\nPTMC beads containing 5 wt% gentamicin were made and immersed in lipase solution, \n\nthe release profile (Figure 9) shows a lower gentamicin release when compared with PMMA \n\nSeptopal\u00ae beads (immersed in PBS). \n\nGentamicin release from PMMA beads are consequently higher than from PTMC beads \n\nwith the same initial gentamicin content. However, the differences observed were not \n\nstatistically significant (p>0.05). PMMA beads show a burst release, namely within the first 24 \n\nh about 30 % is released and this gradually increases to 85 % after 2 weeks. \n\nIn order to reach a similar gentamicin release from the two types of beads, new PTMC \n\nbeads were made with higher gentamicin contents (7.5 wt% instead of 5 wt%). In this case, the \n\nrelease profile achieved for PTMC was found to be very close to the PMMA release (Figure \n\n10), although the gentamicin content in PTMC is higher than in PMMA Septopal\u00ae. \n\nFigure 9. Cumulative gentamicin release from PTMC beads (containing 5 wt % gentamicin) in lipase \n\nsolution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent assays \u00b1 \nstandard deviation. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nCholesterol esterase is one of the enzymes that has been implicated in the in vivo \n\ndegradation of PTMC [35]. In the Figure 11, a comparison between the release profile of \n\ngentamicin from PTMC beads (7.5 wt% gentamicin) immersed in lipase solution and immersed \n\nin cholesterol esterase solution is provided. \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Cumulative gentamicin release from PTMC beads (containing 7.5 wt % gentamicin) in lipase \n\nsolution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent assays \u00b1 \n\nstandard deviation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nPTMC beads show higher gentamicin release in the presence of lipase solution than in \n\ncholesterol esterase. Even though, the lipase solution used is much more concentrated (100 U/g) \n\ncompared to the cholesterol esterase solution (30.9 U/mg \u2013 which is approximately the same \n\nconcentration that can be found in human blood). PTMC beads should have been made with a \n\nnew adjusted gentamicin concentration to reach a higher release profile in the presence of \n\ncholesterol esterase. \n\nGentamicin-loaded PTMC beads in cholesterol esterase showed a lower release than \n\nPMMA beads (Figure 12). Gentamicin concentration should be adjusted once again, so we \n\ncould have an antibiotic release from PTMC similar to the one observed from PMMA.  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n r\n\ne\nle\n\na\nse\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nTime  (h)\n\nPTMC (Lipase) PTMC (Cholesterol esterase)\n\nFigure 11. Cumulative gentamicin release from PTMC beads (7.5 wt % gentamicin) in lipase and \ncholesterol esterase solutions. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent assays \u00b1 standard \n\ndeviation. \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nThe mode of enzymatic surface erosion by cholesterol esterase and superoxide anion \n\nradicals, mediated by macrophages, was only recently discovered and PTMC appears to fully \n\ndegrade in bone and assist in promoting bone regeneration [19]. \n\nThe in vivo degradation of PTMC appears to be molecular weight dependent. Previous \n\nstudies have showed that the polymer with greater molecular weight degrades faster in vivo than \n\nthe lower molecular weight. A possible explanation is that a greater hydrophilicity of the lower \n\nmolecular weight surface after aqueous conditioning, alters the conformation of the enzyme \n\nwhen absorbed, thus reducing its activity [35].  \n\nIn the present work, only one molecular weight for PTMC (556 g/mol) was used, \n\nnevertheless it would have been interesting to use different molecular weights with different \n\ndegradation rates to evaluate different release profiles for the produced beads. However, due to \n\ntime restrictions and materials availability restrictions this was not possible. \n\nFor drug delivery applications, surface erosion is desirable since it provides controllable \n\nand sustained high drug release [26]. In this study, PTMC surface eroding was not tested as it \n\nwas not part of our goal. However, the beads could have been weighed before and after release, \n\nFigure 12. Cumulative gentamicin release from PTMC beads (7.5 wt% gentamicin) in cholesterol \nesterase solution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent \n\nassays \u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nalso scanning electron micrographs could have been taken before and after incubation in \n\nenzymatic solution to evaluate surface topographies [26]. \n\n3.2. CLINICALLY ISOLATED STRAINS \n\nIn the current study, 5 different isolated strains from diabetic patients were available. An \n\nEpsilometer test (Etest\u00ae) was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of each strain to gentamicin. \n\nThe strains selected to be further used were the ones with the lowest MIC values and are \n\npresented in Table 4. \n\nTable 4. Minimum inhibitory concentration values (\u00b5g/mL) for Staphylococcus .aureus and \n\nEnterobacter cloacae in NB medium without and with the addition of 2.6 g/L of glucose. \n\nS. aureus E. cloacae \n\nMIC-value \n\n(NB) \n\nMIC-value \n\n(NB + Glucose) \n\nMIC-value \n\n(NB) \n\nMIC-value \n\n(NB + Glucose) \n\n0,125 0,19 0,125 0,38 \n\nThe test was performed in medium without and with glucose to assess the glucose effect \n\non the sensitivity of each strain to gentamicin. It was possible to conclude that the presence of \n\nglucose decreases the sensitivity of all strains to gentamicin, which can explain the difficulty \n\nobserved in the treatment of an infection by these strains in diabetic patients exhibiting elevated \n\nblood glucose levels [9].  \n\nThe glucose influence on the biofilm mass and its effect on gentamicin sensitivity has \n\nalso been assessed. \n\nGrowth curves for the selected strains are presented in Figure 13 enabling the \n\nvisualization of the glucose impact in planktonic bacteria.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 13, both strains grow faster and to a higher cell density in the \n\nmedium containing glucose. \n\n3.3. BIOFILM GROWTH \n\nBiofilm bacteria are phenotypically different from planktonic cells of the same species, \n\ntherefore their response to the environment is different [37]. \n\n(A) \n\nFigure 13. Growth curves (A) Enterobacter cloacae; (B) Staphylococcus aureus, in NB medium with \n\n(+Glucose) and without glucose (-Glucose). \n\n(B) \n\n6\n0\n0\n n\n\nm\n \n\n6\n0\n0\n n\n\nm\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nAfter selecting the strains and observing the growth of their planktonic bacteria in \n\nmedium with and without glucose, the biofilm behavior of these strains was studied.  \n\nIt is known that the biofilm mass increases with increasing glucose concentrations \n\nthrough the accessory gene regulatory (agr) pathway. However, few concentrations that span \n\nthe hyperglycemic range of 100 \u2013 500 mg/dL have been studied and no additional details \n\nregarding the dose response of biofilm formation to glucose levels in the clinically relevant \n\nrange of 20 \u2013 300 mg/dL have been reported [9]. \n\nThroughout the present study, only one concentration of glucose 260 mg/dL, between \n\nthe relevant range was tested.  \n\nTwo different stains were used to evaluate biofilm growth, namely crystal violet staining \n\n(stains the entire biofilm) and MTT staining (stains only metabolic active and thus living \n\nbacteria). Both species formed more biofilm when glucose was added to the medium (Figure \n\n14). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n+ \n\nGlucose  \n\n+ \n\nGlucose  \n\n+ \n\nGlucose  \n\n(\n\n2) \n\n+ \n\nGlucose  \n\n(2) \n\n(1) \n\nFigure 14.

Results correspond to the average of 6 counts \u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n6\n0\n0\n n\n\nm\n \n\n6\n0\n0\n n\n\nm\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nSince the biofilm mass increases in the presence of glucose, it would be important to \n\nevaluate the response to different concentrations of glucose and the response of a multi-species \n\nbiofilm to these concentrations. It is important to notice that a mono-species biofilm was used in \n\nthe current study. \n\nDiabetic foot infections are predominantly polymicrobial, the diversity of bacterial \n\npopulations in chronic wounds may be an important contributor to the chronicity of wounds and \n\nthe biofilm mode of growth of the infecting organisms appears to have a great influence on \n\nchronic wound healing process [2]. Bacterial species interact extensively with each other and \n\nthese interactions determine the structure development of multi-species biofilms [38]. \n\nTherefore, the reaction to glucose and the response to the prevention and treatment of a multi-\n\nspecies biofilm would be different from a mono-species one. \n\n3.3.1. PREVENTION OF BIOFILM GROWTH \n\nBiofilm prevention was performed with two gentamicin concentrations (5 and 10 \n\n\u00b5g/mL) in the presence and without glucose. Strains were seeded for 1 h and immediately after, \n\ngentamicin was added starting the prevention treatment. \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\n\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\n5 \u00b5g/mL 10 \u00b5g/mL (A) \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nFigure 15 indicates a higher number of cells in the presence of glucose. Nevertheless, \n\nthis number is lower when the gentamicin concentration used is higher, as expected.  \n\nThe control (without gentamicin) was used to test the gentamicin effect on the biofilm \n\ngrowth. For E. cloacae a reduction in the number of cells was observed, namely from 8.5 to 4.3 \n\nwithout glucose and from 8.9 to 4.7 with glucose, when 5 \u00b5g/mL of gentamicin was added. The \n\nsame outcome was obtained with the higher gentamicin concentration and for S. aureus. A \n\nreduction with the addition of 5 \u00b5g/mL of gentamicin was found from 8.6 to 5.4 without \n\nglucose and 8.8 to 7.7 with glucose. \n\n3.3.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILMS \n\nBiofilms were grown for 24 and 48 h and were further treated with two different \n\ngentamicin concentrations, 500 and 1000 \u00b5g/mL. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\n\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\n5 \u00b5g/mL 10 \u00b5g/mL\n\n(B) \n\nFigure 15.

ANTI-BIOFILM EFFICACY \n\nA biofilm model was developed by testing the glucose addition and different gentamicin \n\nconcentrations effects. The results were used to design an anti-biofilm strategy to prevent and \n\ntreat the biofilm, using the gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads previously produced and degraded \n\nin cholesterol esterase. \n\n3.4.1. PREVENT BIOFILM GROWTH \n\nThe release profile of gentamicin from PTMC loaded beads in cholesterol esterase \n\nsolution showed a release of approximately 100 \u00b5g/mL. The beads were kept in a cholesterol \n\nesterase solution (78 mL) until a final release gentamicin concentration of approximately 7.5 \n\n\u00b5g/mL was reached. The elution media of the beads was used to prevent biofilm growth for 24 \n\nh and was applied after 1 h of pre-culture seeded (Figure 18).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\n\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\n \n\nPTMC control PTMC loaded\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\n \n\nPTMC control PTMC loaded\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA reduced number of cells was observed in the presence of gentamicin compared with \n\nthe control (elution media of PTMC bead without gentamicin). The same trend was observed \n\nwhen glucose was added to the medium, namely the biofilm mass was higher. \n\nConfocal images were taken (Figure 19) only for S. aureus, in order to have a clearer \n\nresult of the gentamicin effect and glucose influence on the biofilm growth.  \n\n(\n\nA) \n\nFigure 18.

When gentamicin is added to the medium there is a \n\nreduction in the number of cells, even though this was not so pronounced when glucose was \n\npresent. The strain recognizes the hostile environment and forms clusters in an attempt to \n\nprotect itself from the antibiotic (Figure 19 B).  \n\n3.4.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILM \n\nBiofilm treatment with PTMC loaded beads was compared wit h PMMA Septopal\u00ae \n\nbeads and S. aureus was the only strain tested. The treatment was performed for 24 h and 48 h.  \n\nIn these experiments, the beads were used directly to treat the biofilm. These were \n\nplaced in the wells where the biofilm was grown, together with the cholesterol esterase \n\ndegradation solution (in the cases where PTMC beads were used). \n\nAfter 24 h of treatment (Figure 20), the results suggest that PMMA beads are more \n\nefficient in the biofilm treatment, being more evident in the situation where no glucose was \n\nadded to the medium. \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nThe treatment proceed for another 24 h (Figure 21) and in this case, PTMC completely \n\neradicated the biofilm when glucose was not present, thus appearing to be more effective than \n\nPMMA Septopal\u00ae beads. \n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\n\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\nPTMC loaded PMMA\n\nFigure 20.

Results \n\ncorrespond to the average of 3 counts \u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nIn the presence of glucose, the treatment with both beads was similar. However, this was \n\nnot tested in the assays designed for studying the biofilm prevention. The glucose effect, \n\naugmenting biofilm mass, was notable once again. \n\nThe glucose influence on the biofilm growth was only tested in vitro and the culture \n\nmedium used did not include many of the dissolved proteins or antibacterial peptides that are \n\ncommonly present in the human blood and extracellular fluids [9]. This is a limitation of this \n\nstudy since it is not known yet, the effect of this environment on the findings herein reported. \n\nMoreover, most of the biofilm experiments were not performed in triplicate due to time \n\nrestrictions and therefore, no statistical analyses could be done. \n\nFurthermore, in vivo the treatment with the beads would take approximately 2 weeks. \n\nHowever, in this model the beads were only tested for 2 days at most, so the anti-biofilm \n\nefficacy is expected to be increased by prolonging the treatment period.  \n\nIn this study, we used two different bacterial strains, the Gram-positive cocci S. aureus \n\nand the Gram-negative rods E. cloacae. From the results gathered, it was possible to observe \n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n - Glucose  + Glucose\n\nL\no\n\ng\n C\n\nF\nU\n\nPTMC Loaded PMMA\n\nFigure 21.

Conclusions and Future Perspectives \n\nIn the current work, gentamicin loaded PTMC beads were made with the same size as \n\nPMMA Septopal\u00ae beads. The release profile of both beads was compared and this release was \n\noptimized for the PTMC beads by adjusting the gentamicin content so their release would \n\nmatch the one found in the PMMA beads.  \n\nThe release profile for PTMC beads was studied in the presence of concentrated lipase \n\nsolution mimicking the in vivo release, as well as in the presence of cholesterol esterase an \n\nenzyme involved in the degradation of PTMC and that can be found in the human body. \n\nPTMC holds a great potential to be used as a drug delivery device due to its surface \n\neroding degradation that allows the release of small and large compounds. The polymer also \n\npermits the combination of antibiotics which is not possible with the PMMA Septopal\u00ae beads. \n\nDiabetic patients have high blood glucose level which seems to increase the \n\npathogenicity of infecting microbes through a greater biofilm formation. This study also aimed \n\nto evaluate the biofilm response to a specific glucose concentration. It was possible to conclude \n\nthat the mass of the biofilm increased when 2.6 g/L of glucose was added to the culture medium \n\nalthough, in the future, it would be important to test this response to different glucose \n\nconcentrations and in different growth media to extend the conclusions herein drawn. The \n\ncomparison between the biofilm mass when grown in a normal glucose level and at a high \n\nglucose level should also be pursued. \n\nThe biofilm model developed showed that S. aureus and E. cloacae biofilm mass \n\nincreased when glucose was added to the culture medium, resulting in reduced gentamicin \n\nsensitivity. This fact contributes to the difficulty in treating the diabetic foot osteomyelitis. \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nA similar release profile and biofilm inhibition between PTMC beads and PMMA \n\nSeptopal\u00ae was possible to achieve, hence the former polymer seems a very promising \n\nbiodegradable carrier for the in situ treatment of osteomyelitis. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n References \n\n[1] White, R. and McIntosh, C.
