Seven surgeries were done due to bilateral \ninvolvement of the cranial cruciate ligament in one dog. Clinical \nevaluation was performed on postoperative days 3, 10 and 40, \nand radiographic evaluation was done at 5 and 24 months after \nsurgery in five dogs, where signs of progressive degenerative \njoint disease were confirmed. Resolution of clinical signs was \nobserved from 25 to 68 days after surgery as evaluated by dog \nowners. Overall function of joint movement after surgery was \nclassified as good. Two dogs presented fraying of the implant \nafter surgery. It was concluded that the polyester prosthesis, as \nimplanted in these dogs, was not a satisfactory replacement for \nthe injured ligament, as better results may be obtained with less \ninvasive and simpler techniques.  \n \nKey words : polyester prosthesis, cranial cruciate ligament, dog. \n \nRESUMO  \n \n Os achados cl\u00ednicos e radiogr\u00e1ficos ap\u00f3s reparo \nintra -articular do ligamento cruzado cranial com pr\u00f3tese de \npoli\u00e9ster, utilizando a t\u00e9cnica over-the-top modificada, foram \navaliada em seis c\u00e3es. Sete cirurgias foram realizadas devido ao \nacometimento bilateral em um dos animais.

Older dogs \nmay present an insidious episode of lameness \n\n\n\nSelmi et al. \n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 5, 2002. \n\n794 \n\nprobably associated with degenerative changes \nwithin the joint prior to CCL rupture (DENNY, \n1993). Pain is normally observed during palpation \nafter a traumatic rupture (MOORE &amp; READ, 1996b) \nand dogs will start to use the limb again within two \nto three weeks; however, as degenerative joint \ndisease (DJD) progresses, hindlimb lamenes will \nbecome evident. DJD may be present at the time of \nrupture (MOORE &amp; READ, 1996b) or result from \ninstability caused by primary incompetence of the \nCCL (ELKINS et al., 1991; VASSEUR &amp; BERRY, \n1992; FITCH et al., 1995; METELMAN et al., \n1995).  \n\nCranial drawer sign is normally present in \na CCL-deficient stifle and diagnosis of a ruptured \nligament is confirmed after arthrotomy (HULSE, \n1995; MOORE &amp; READ, 1996b; PIERMATTEI &amp; \nFLO, 1997). Recent studies have shown that \nradiographic evaluation of affected joints does not \nconsistently assess joint instability (ROOSTER &amp; \nVAN BREE, 1999), but it may be indicated to \nevaluate secondary degenerative changes within the \njoint (HULSE, 1995; RACKARD, 1996). \n\nNon-surgical treatment of CCL ruptures \nmay be effective in dogs weighing less than 15kg \n(VASSEUR, 1984), however, heavier or active dogs \nwill benefit from surgical stabilization of the \naffected joint (HULSE, 1995; MOORE &amp; READ, \n1996a; PIERMATTEI &amp; FLO, 1997). Described \nsurgical techniques are divided into two major \ngroups: intra or extra -articular procedures. Extra-\narticular techniques rely on placement of a lateral \nband of biological tissue or synthetic material for \nlimiting cranial translation and internal rotation of \nthe tibia, resulting in periarticular fibrosis (AIKEN \net al., 1992; RACKARD, 1996; VASSEUR et al., \n1996), whereas intra -articular repair is theoretically \npreferable as it provides a more accurate function of \nthe created neoligament (A RNOCSKY, 1996; \nVASSEUR et al., 1996). \n\nMaterials used as substitutes for the \nruptured CCl include autogenous fascia lata \n(ELKINS et al., 1991; ARNOCSKY, 1993; \nCOETZEE &amp; LUBBE, 1995; METELMAN et al., \n1995; MOORE &amp; READ, 1996a) and synthetic \nreplacements (MOORE &amp; READ, 1996a, \nVASSEUR et al., 1996; CAMARGO et al., 2001). \nSynthetic materials are advantageous in comparison \nwith biological materials because they can be made \nto meet requirements of intra -articular placement \nand surgery is less traumatic as it is related to \ncollection of biological grafts (VASSEUR et al., \n1996). The Leeds-Keio implant was experimentally \nused in dogs (FUJIKAWA &amp; ISEKI, 1991; \nVASSEUR et al., 1996) and sheep (SCHINDHELM \n\net al., 1991) with the purpose of serving as a \nscaffold for ingrowth of pre -placed autogenous \ntissue resulting in formation of a biological \nligament.  \n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate \nt h e  clinical and radiographic results after repairing \nof the CCL-deficient stifle in dogs using a polyester \nprostheses. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHOD \n \nCase details and evaluation \n This study was conducted in six \nconsecutive dogs suspected of having cranial \ncruciate ligament rupture presented to the Veterinary \nTeaching Hospital of the Universidade Estadual \nPaulista at Jaboticabal, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \nData obtained from clinical files included breed, sex, \nbody weight, age at presentation, clinical signs, \nduration of symptoms and previous treatments. \nClinical diagnosis was based in the presence of \nhindlimb lameness associated with a positive cranial \ndrawer sign. Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament \nwas confirmed during exploratory arthrotomy. \n\nThe degree of lameness was recorded and \nclassified as: grade 0 (free of lameness), grade 1 \n(lameness only after exercise), grade 2 (weight-\nbearing with intermitent lameness), grade 3 \n(continuous weight-bearing lameness) and grade 4 \n(non-weight-bearing lameness). Radiographs taken \nin cranio-caudal and medio -lateral projections were \nused to assess any secondary osteoarthritic changes \nat the time of presentation and after surgery. \nDegenerative changes were classified according to \nCOETZEE &amp; LUBBE (1995) as: absent (no \nosteophytes ), mild (osteophytes visible on the patella \nonly), moderate (osteophytes on the patella and \ntrochlear ridges of the femur) and severe (severe \nosteophyte formation, sclerosis and irregularities on \nthe fabelllae). \n\n \nSurgical procedure \n\nDogs were anesthetized and the affected \nlimb prepared for asseptic surgery. Amoxicilin -\nclavulanatea was given subcutaneously and flunixin \nmeglumineb was given intravenously at the time of \ninduction. A lateral parapatellar approach to the joint \nwas used. After incision of the join t capsule, the \npatella was luxated medially for exploration of the \njoint. Remnants of the cranial cruciate ligaments \nwere excised and the joint flushed with 0,9% saline. \nA tibial tunnel was prepared by drilling a hole in the \ncranio-medial portion of the tibial insertion of the \nCCL so that the distal portion of the hole emerged in \nthe medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis. \n\n\n\nClinical and radiographic evaluation of a polyester prosthesis in dogs... \n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 5, 2002. \n\n795 \n\nA drill hole was then made in the lateral aspect of \nthe lateral femoral condyle and one of the \nextremities of the prosthesis c was secured in place \nwith a washer and screw. The free end of the \nprosthesis was directed from caudal to cranial, over \nthe top of the lateral femoral condyle, emerging in \nthe intercondylar fossa, passing through the tibial \ntunnel, pulled snugly from within the joint, and fixed \nin place with a washer and a screw with the limb in \nexternal rotation and slight flexion, while the tibia \nwas pushed caudally. \n\nAfter thorough lavage of the joint with \n0.9% saline, the joint capsule was closed using \npolyglactin d in a simple continuous pattern. The \nretinaculum was sutured in a similar manner using a \npolydioxanonee suture. Subcutaneous and skin were \nsutured in a routine manner. Limbs were not \nbandaged after the surgery and dogs were dismissed \nfrom hospital immediately after recovery from \nanesthesia. Owners started passive range of motion \nat postoperative day 1. Exercise was limited to leash \nwalks for 6 weeks after surgery. \n\nDogs were evaluated clinically on \npostoperative days 3, 10 and 40. In four animals, \nclinical and radiographic evaluations were \nperformed at 5 and 24 months after surgery. \n\n \nRESULTS \n \n All dogs had a complete rupture of the \nCCL as observed intra -operatively. In this study, \nseven joints were operated, as dog # 2 presented a \ncontralateral rupture 4 months after initial \npresentation. The mean age of dogs was 4.8 \u00b1 0.48 \nyears with a mean body weight of 40 \u00b1 16.5kg. \nEqual distribution of males and females was \nobserved. Dogs did not present \na meniscus lesion at time of \nsurgery. Dog # 1 was presented \nseven months after initial \nsurgery with ipsilateral \nhindlimb lameness and was \nsubmitted to an exploratory \nstifle arthrotomy. Rupture of \nthe polyester prostheses was \nobserved and a lateral fabello -\ntibial suture was used to \nstabilize the joint. Dog # 5 died \n18 months after initial surgery \nfrom unrelated causes and at \nnecropsy, severe osteophytosis \nand complete rupture of the \nprostheses was observed. In \nboth cases where rupture of the \nprosthesis was observed, it \n\noccurred proximal to the insertion at the tibial \ntunnel. \n On presentation, one dog presented grade \n1 lameness, two had grade 2 lameness and three had \ngrade 3 lameness (Table 1). A positive cranial \ndrawer sign was observed in all affected stifles in \nboth extension and flexion, indicating complete \nrupture of the CCL. \n\nDogs were bearing weight on the operated \nlimbs 3 to 10 days after surgery. Cranial drawer sign \nwas not observed at this time interval, however, by \nday 40 postoperatively, it increased in all of the \nstifles as compared to immediate postoperative \nevaluation. Limb use was consistently poorer on \npostoperative day 3, but it progressively improved \nafter 10 to 40 days when lameness was absent in \nthree dogs and had diminished by at least one grade \nin the others (Table 1). Continuous weight-bearing \nwas observed starting from day 25 to 68 as reported \nby owners. Dogs # 1, 2, and 3 were clinically and \nradiographically assessed at 5 and 24 months after \nsurgery. Dogs # 4 and 6 were not evaluated at 5 \nmonths but were at 24 months postoperatively. Dog \n# 1 was also evaluated seven months after initial \nsurgery. All dogs were classified as having good \nlimb function according to their owners, however, \njoint laxity accompanied by crepitation and \ndiminished range of motion was observed in all \ndogs. Pain was not elicited on manipulation of the \noperated joints. Thickening of medial aspect of the \njoint was observed in all dogs. Dog # 1 was \nclinically normal 19 months after the extra-articular \nfabello-tibial suture.  \n Signs of degenerative joint disease were \npresent in different degrees but in one dog (dog #1) \nat initial presentation. Three dogs had a mild \n\nTable 1 - Data summary of patients treated with a polyester prosthesis for surgical stabilization \nof cranial cruciate-deficient stifle. \n\n \nDOG # 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\nSEX F M F M M F \nAGE (YEARS) 5 4.3 4.2 4.8 5.5 5 \nWEIGHT (KG)  46 34 19 32 68 41 \nTIME FROM INJURY TO PRESENTATION (DAYS) 2 4 14 21 3 20 \nLAMENESS AT PRESENTATION (GRADE) 2 3 1 2 3 3 \nLAMENESS AT DAY 3 (GRADE) 3 3 2 2 4 3 \nLAMENESS AT DAY 10 (GRADE) 2 2 2 2 3 2 \nLAMENESS AT DAY 40 (GRADE) 1 0 0 0 1 1 \nDJD AT PRESENTATION A MI MI MI MO MO \nDJD AFTER SURGERY (5 MONTHS)  MO MO MI N/A SE N/A \nDJD AFTER SURGERY (24 MONTHS)  MO MO MO MO N/A MO \n\n \nA \u2013 absent; Mi \u2013 mild; Mo \u2013 moderate; Se \u2013 severe; F \u2013 female; M \u2013 male; grade 1: lameness \nonly after execise; grade 2: weight-bearing with intermitent lameness; grade 3: continuous \nweight-bearing lameness; grade 4: non-weight-bearing lameness; Djd \u2013 degenerative joint \ndisease; N/A \u2013 not available. \n\n\n\nSelmi et al. \n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 5, 2002. \n\n796 \n\nosteophytosis, whereas two had a moderate lesion. \nRadiographic signs of progression of degenerative \nchanges at 5 and 24 months after surgery were \nobserved in five dogs by at least one g rade (Table 1). \n A limb bandage was not applied \npostoperatively in order to allow early mobilization \nof the operated limbs. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n This study suggests that the use of a \npolyester prosthesis is not a satisfactory replacement \nfor the cruciate ligament, as observed by VASSEUR \net al. (1996) using similar prostheses in a canine \nmodel. CAMARGO et al. (2001) recently described \nlack of satisfactory results using the same prostheses \nin human patients. \n\nSuccesful management of a ruptured cranial \ncruciate ligament depends upon the re -establishment of \njoint stability. Factors as mechanical properties of the \ngraft, the type of graft -bone fixation, isometricity, \ntension applied to the autograft during fixation and \nfilling of the intercondylar fossa with osteophytes may \ninfluence the outcome (COETZEE &amp; LUBBE, 1995; \nFITCH et al., 1995; VASSEUR et al., 1996). Ideally, \nthe initial mechanical strenght of the synthetic graft \nshould be great enough to maintain an adequate degree \nof stability as peri-articular fibrosis may ultimately \nprovide the final stabilization of surgically treated \nstifles. \n\nConsidering the fact that a similar implant \nknown as the Leeds-Keio prostheses was not intended to \nbe a permanent replacement for the CCL (FUJIKAWA \n&amp; ISEKI, 1991; VASSEUR et al., 1996), it is important \nthat the stifle is returned to a relatively stable condition \nwhile fibrosis of the joint capsule occurs. \n\nComplete rupture of the Leeds-Keio \nimplant in dogs has been attributed to excessive strain \nduring joint flexion as a result of incorrect isometric \nplacement (VASSEUR et al., 1996). Cruciate \nligaments have a multi-bundle design so each fiber \nbundle is stressed or relaxed during a particular joint \nmovement (ARNOCSKY, 1996). Correct isometric \nplacement of the grafts may not be possible because \nthe cruciate ligament has a multi-bundle design, \ntherefore a ligament substitute would need to have a \nsimilar design in which each bundle would work \nindependently. Also, isometric placement of implants \nimplicates that the graft would be under even tension \nat all degrees of joint movement, however, the \nprosthesis used in this study is not constructed as an \nindependent collection of bundles, therefore, some \nportion of the implant would be subjected to \nexcessive strain during joint motion. \n\nOther causes for implant failure are \nabrasion of the implants at the margin of the drill \nholes (VASSEUR et al., 1996; CAMARGO et al., \n2001) or filling of the intercondylar fossa with \nosteophytes (FITCH et al., 1995). Notchplasty is \nperformed commonly in human patients to minimize \nimpingement of the graft during extremes of joint \nmotion (VASSEUR &amp; BERRY, 1992). By using an \nover-the-top procedure and not drilling a femoral \ntunnel, as described by VASSEUR et al. (1996), less \ncontact of the prosthesis and bone was achieved. \nAccording to ARNOCSKY (1996) this approach \nwould also place the graft as close to the isometric \ncondition as possible. In this clinical study, despite \nthe fact that neither rounding of the edges of the \ntibial drill holes nor notchplasty were performed, \nresults were similar to that described by VASSEUR \net al. (1996) and CAMARGO et al. (2001) who \nobserved complete rupture or fraying of the \nimplants. In the two cases where rupture of the \nprostheses was observed, it occurred just proximal to \nthe tibial tunnel. Abrasion at the tibial drill holes \ncould be implied as the cause for this complication. \nHowever, excessive cyclic deformation compressing \nthe caudal portion of the prosthesis against the tibial \nplateau during flexion could explain the mode of \nfailure observed in this study. Beveling of the tibial \ntunnel could have been beneficial in preventing this \ncomplication. In spite of the small number of clinical \ncases in this study, or experimental situations, at \nwhat point notchplasties would be beneficial in \npreventing implant failure in the dog is still unclear. \n\nSigns of progression of degenerative joint \ndisease are commom in radiographic studies \nconcerning the postoperative evaluation of stifle \nsurgery (ELKINS et al., 1991; VASSEUR &amp; BERRY, \n1992; DOVERSPIKE et al., 1993; CHAUVET et al., \n1996; VASSEUR et al., 1996; ROOSTER &amp; Van \nBREE, 1999). Progression of osteophytosis following \nimplantation of the polyester prosthesis in dogs \ntherefore demonstrates that the technique is not \nadequate in preventing joint instability as observed by \nVASSEUR et al. (1996) and CAMARGO et al. (2001) \nwhen using a similar prosthesis. \n\nA positive cranial drawer sign is the most \nimportant finding in a dog with a ruptured cranial \ncruciate ligament, and immediate evaluation \nfollowing surgery usually reveals a stable joint. \nHowever, as limb use improves, more weight is put \non it and the implant becomes more prone to \ndeformation, which usually is observed as joint \nlaxity at subsequent evaluations following surgical \ntreatment. Unsufficiently secure methods of fixation \nof the graft, stretching, fraying or deformation as \nwell as complete rupture have been implicated as \n\n\n\nClinical and radiographic evaluation of a polyester prosthesis in dogs... \n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v. 32, n. 5, 2002. \n\n797 \n\ncauses of increased joint instability in the long-term \nevaluation (AIKEN et al., 1992; COETZEE &amp; \nLUBBE, 1995; VASSEUR et al., 1996).  \n\nClinical evaluation of gait in dogs might \npresent errors, as the mood of the dog, location of \ntesting, weather and many other factors can affect \narthritic pain besides being a subjective evaluation \nof lameness (CHAUVET et al., 1996). Thus, \nimprovement in gait, as observed in this study, \nsimply demonstrates adaptation from individual \ndogs to the condition where shifting the weight \ncould result in a better clinical evaluation, or it \ncould represent stability after joint capsule \ntickening, or both. Although dogs in this study \npresented mild cranial drawer instability, crepitus \nand reduced range of motion following surgery, \nlimb usage and degree of lameness were considered \nsatisfactory, which is consistent with other study \nthat showed poor correlation between pre sence of \ndegenerative changes and clinical lameness \n(AIKEN et al., 1992). \n\nIngrowth of autogenous tissue around the \nsynthetic replacement for the cranial cruciate \nligament has been observed (FUJIKAWA&amp; ISEKI, \n1991; SCHINDHELM et al., 1991). Evaluation of \ntis sue ingrowth was not intended in this clinical \nstudy, however, as observed by CAMARGO et al. \n(2001) formation of a neoligament around the \nimplant was not observed in the two cases that were \navailable for macroscopic examination. \n\nDog # 1 was treated after rupture of the \npolyester prosthesis by means of a lateral fabello -\ntibial suture and did not show any complication after \nthe second surgery; however, conclusions cannot be \nmade due to the limited number of dogs that \nrequired a second surgery in the same limb , and \nvariability of the care after surgery. \n\nIn conclusion, the polyester prosthesis \nused in this study did not prevent joint instability \nand progression of DJD, and could not be considered \na satisfactory replacement for the cranial cruciate \nligament in dogs as simpler techniques present \ncomparable results. \n \nSOURCES AND MANUFACTURERS \n \na Clavamox; Smithkline Beecham.  \nb Banamine; Schering-Plough.  \nc Pr\u00f3tese Engimplan; Engimplan.  \nd Vicryl; Ethicon.  \ne PDS II; Ethicon.  \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAIKEN, S.W., BAUER, M.S., TOOMBS, J.P.
