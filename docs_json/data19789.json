MATERIALS\nAND METHODS: Initially, 21 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and diagnosed with splenic siderotic\nnodules by magnetic resonance imaging were ultrasonographically evaluated for determining the method\nsensitivity. In a second phase, the method reproducibility in the detection and quantification of siderotic nodules\n(A: 1\u20135 nodules; B: 6\u201320 nodules; C: > 20 nodules) was evaluated in 30 patients who were submitted to\nultrasonography blindly and independently assessed by two observers. Interobserver agreement was measured\nby kappa statistics. RESULTS: Ultrasound sensitivity was 95.2% (95% confidence interval [77.3%; 99.2%]).\nIntermethod agreement in the detection of siderotic nodules was 96.7% (95% confidence interval [82.8%;\n99.9%]). For classification of nodules according to their quantification, the kappa test demonstrated a\nstatistically significant interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.67).

Portal hyperten-\nsion is the most frequent cause of splenic\nsiderotic nodules(7).\n\nGamna-Gandy bodies may be evaluated\nby different imaging methods(8), but pres-\nently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)m\nespecially with gradient-echo sequences is\nconsidered as the method of choice in the\ndetection of these nodules(9,10). The US\nvalue in the assessment of Gamna-Gandy\nbodies has been discussed in the literature\nwith controversial results and sensitivity\nranging between 12% and 70.6%(10,11).\n\nAs regards diagnostic tests, a decisive\nparameter to be taken into consideration is\nthe method accuracy that can be evaluated\nby means of its reproducibility. No study is\navailable in the current literature evaluat-\ning the US reproducibility based on the\nmeasurement of interobserver agreement\nfor detection of splenic siderotic nodules.\n\nThe present study was aimed at measur-\ning the sensitivity and reproducibility of US\nin the detection of splenic siderotic nodules\nin comparison with magnetic resonance\nimaging as standard method.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatients\u2019 selection\n\nIn the first phase of the present study, 20\npatients with hepatosplenic schistosomia-\nsis (11 men and nine women in the age\nrange between 23 and 87 years, mean age\n= 44 years), diagnosed with siderotic nod-\nules at MRI and submitted to ultrasono-\ngraphic evaluation in a term of less than\nthree months for determining the sensitiv-\nity of the method. MRI studies were uti-\nlized as a reference standard in the research,\nand evaluated in consensus by two experi-\nenced observers with more than five years\nof practice in abdominal radiology.\n\nThe second phase of the study was\naimed at evaluating the US reproducibility\nin the detection and quantification of sid-\nerotic nodules in other 30 patients diag-\n\nnosed with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis\n(15 men and 15 women with ages ranging\nbetween 25 and 68 years, mean age = 45\nyears) submitted to ultrasonographic evalu-\nation. All of the US studies were performed\nby two observers with four-year residency\nin imaging diagnosis and previously trained\nto identify and quantify splenic siderotic\nnodules.\n\nAll of the selected patients were above\n18 years of age and being followed-up in\nthe departments of Clinical and/or Surgi-\ncal Gastroenterology at Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo\n\u2013 Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo. Ex-\nclusion criteria were the following: contin-\nued utilization hepatotoxic pharmaceuti-\ncals, positive serology for hepatitis B or C\nviruses, and history of chronic alcoholism.\nThe present study was previously approved\nby the Committee for Ethics in Research of\nthe Institution and a term of free and in-\nformed consent was signed by all of the\npatients.\n\nMRI evaluation\n\nMRI studies were performed in high\nmagnetic field (1.5 tesla) Magnetom Sym-\nphony\u2122 system (Siemens; Erlangen, Ger-\nmany), with multiplanar (axial and coro-\nnal), turbo spin-echo and gradient-echo T1-\nand T2-weighted sequences, before and\nafter intravenous paramagnetic contrast\n\ninjection. The diagnosis of siderotic nod-\nules was defined by the presence of small\nfoci of low-intensity signal on all of the\nsequences, especially on gradient-echo\nT2*-weighted sequences without signifi-\ncant enhancement after contrast injection\n(Figure 1)(9,10). The MRI studies analysis\nwas performed on a Leonardo (Siemens)\nworkstation.\n\nUltrasonographic evaluation\n\nUltrasonography studies were per-\nformed on an EnVisor\u2122 (Philips Medical\nSystems; Bothell, WA, USA) equipment\ncoupled with a convex, multi-frequency\ntransducer.\n\nThe diagnosis was considered as posi-\ntive for siderotic nodules in the presence of\ndispersed, hyperechogenic, parenchymal\nfoci non-attributable to thickened vessels\nwalls in the spleen (Figure 2). Siderotic\nnodules identified were classified accord-\ning to methodology already proposed(12), as\nfollows:\n\n\u2013 Category A: a transverse section of the\nspleen demonstrating &lt;5 nodules (focal);\n\n\u2013 category B: a transverse section of the\nspleen demonstrating 6-20 nodules (scat-\ntered);\n\n\u2013 category C: a transverse section of the\nspleen demonstrating > 20 nodules (dif-\nfuse).\n\nFigure 1.

Mar/Abr;41(2):69\u201373\n\nThe evaluation of the US reproducibil-\nity in determining the presence of siderotic\nnodules in the 30 patients included in the\npresent study demonstrated an interob-\nserver agreement of 96.7% (confidence\ninterval at 95% [82.8%; 99.9%]). The re-\nproducibility of the classification of sid-\nerotic nodules into categories according to\ntheir quantity, demonstrated a substantial\ninterobserver agreement (kappa = 0.672;\nconfidence interval at 95% [0.374; 0.970]).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nUS is considered as the method of\nchoice in the evaluation of schistosomal\npatients, considering its wide availability,\nexcellent cost-benefit ratio, and non-inva-\nsiveness(6). Sonographic alterations de-\ntected in these patients have already been\ndescribed and currently are widely utilized\n\nFigure 2. US imaging of\n\nspleen: longitudinal section\n\ndemonstrating enlarged spleen\n\ndimensions associated with the\n\npresence of several (> 20)\n\nhyperechogenic foci (crossed\n\nmarkers) compatible with sid-\n\nerotic nodules (category C).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe interobserver agreement was mea-\nsured by means of kappa index, an useful\ntest for classifying the variability in the\ninterpretation of different data sets includ-\ning categorical variables(13). Kappa indices\nwere classified as follows: non-significant\n(0.0\u20130.2), median (0.21\u20130.40), moderate\n(0.41\u20130.60), substantial (0.61\u20130.80), and\nalmost-perfect (0.81\u20131.00).\n\nRESULTS\n\nTwenty of the 21 patients with siderotic\nnodules detected by MRI were correctly\nevaluated by US, whereas in only one pa-\ntient ultrasound could not detect these nod-\nules, giving the method a sensitivity of\n95.2% (confidence interval at 95% [77.3%;\n99.2%]).\n\nboth for evaluating the hepatic involve-\nment, determining the level of portal hyper-\ntension and characterizing splenic siderotic\nnodules(4,6,14). However, for establishing\nthe validity of a diagnostic test, it is impor-\ntant to define, besides its efficacy, its accu-\nracy, which can be determined by calculat-\ning the method reproducibility. The present\nstudy has been driven particularly by the\nabsence, in the medical literature, of a sys-\ntematic evaluation of the US reproducibil-\nity by means of the measurement of\ninterobserver agreement as regards the de-\ntection of splenic siderotic nodules.\n\nSiderotic nodules, or Gamna-Gandy\nbodies, were firstly described by Marini, in\n1902, but this entity became actually\nknown with the studies developed in 1905\nand 1921 by Charles Gandy and Carlo\nGamna, giving rise to the eponym(9). Sid-\nerotic nodules consist in small fibrotic nod-\nules impregnated with hemosiderin and, in\nsome cases with calcifications resulting\nfrom focal micro-hemorrhages in the\nsplenic parenchyma, generally related to\ncongestive splenomegaly (Figures 3 and 4).\nMost rarely, siderotic nodules may be\nfound in other tissues such as thymus,\nlymphonodi, liver, heart, and in conditions\nsuch as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobi-\nnuria, leukemia and lymphoma(7,15\u201319).\nHowever, portal hypertension is the most\nfrequent cause of these nodules, which are\npresent in about 9% to 12% of patients with\nportal hypertension for causes unrelated to\nschistosomiasis(9,10).\n\nFigure 3. Macroscopic, axial 10 mm-thick section of spleen showing sid-\n\nerotic nodules (arrows).\n\nFigure 4. Histopathological study of spleen: hematoxilin-eosin stained sec-\n\ntion showing siderotic nodules (arrow) \u2013 optical microscopy, 80\u00d7 magnifica-\n\ntion.\n\n\n\n72\n\nGonzalez TD et al.\n\nRadiol Bras. 2008 Mar/Abr;41(2):69\u201373\n\nThe relevance of detecting the presence\nof splenic siderotic nodules by means of\nimaging methods is related to the fact that\nthese nodules represent a morphological\nevidence of a long lasting portal hyperten-\nsion process(20).\n\nCurrently the relevant role of MRI as a\nreference method in the detection of sid-\nerotic nodules is a consensus in the litera-\nture(8\u201310,20\u201323). MRI is extremely sensitive to\nparamagnetic contrast agents; hemoglobin\nproducts (for example, hemosiderin) have\na paramagnetic effect, being easily detected\non RM images (especially the high field\nones), were they appear like low-signal\nintensity nodules or absent signal on spin-\necho and especially gradient-echo T1- and\nT2-weighted images(8,9,20) (Figure 1). These\nnodules also can be evaluated by other\nimaging methods such as computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) and US. On US images, the\nnodules appear as small, punctate hy-\nperechogenic foci sparsely scattered in the\nsplenic parenchyma, with or without pos-\nterior acoustic shadowing, non-attributable\nto small vessels walls(7) (Figure 2).\n\nThe incidence of these nodules initially\ndescribed in the literature for schistosomal\npatients in the hepatosplenic phase, was of\n7% in studies utilizing US as imaging\nmethod(14). Most recently, studies utilizing\nMRI have found a much higher incidence\nof siderotic nodules (84.2%) in schistoso-\nmal patients(21). In the present study, the\nfrequency of detection of siderotic nodules\nby US and MRI in patients with hepato-\nsplenic schistosomiasis was also very high,\nranging between 96.6% and 100%.\n\nUltrasonography sensitivity in the de-\ntection of siderotic nodules also has been\ndiscussed. Differently from previous stud-\nies developed in the eighties, reporting sen-\nsitivities between 10.5% and 25%(9,10), the\ncurrent literature describes a high diagnos-\ntic accuracy for this method, with 70.6%\nsensitivity, 78.9% specificity, and 85.7%\npositive predictive value(11). The results of\nthe present study surpassed these latter,\nwith 95.2% sensitivity. This discrepancy in\nrelation to the US frequency and sensitiv-\nity in detecting siderotic nodules can be\nattributed to the utilization of observers\nspecifically trained for researching these\nnodules, and, also, to the technological\ndevelopments of US systems over the last\n\ntwo decades, with an expressive improve-\nment in their images resolution.\n\nApparently, in cirrhotic patients, the\npresence and number of siderotic nodules\nare associated with their level of portal\nhypertension(20). The quantification of\nthese nodules and their classification into\ncategories according to the number of nod-\nules found had been already proposed for\nthe liver(12), but had not been utilized for the\nspleen yet. The present study found a high\ninterobserver agreement as to the overall\npresence or absence of siderotic nodules\n(96.7%). Regarding the US reproducibility\nfor the quantification and classification of\nsiderotic nodules into categories, the kappa\nindex showed a substantial interobserver\nagreement (0.67). Additional studies are\nrequired for determining the significance of\nthis quantification and its actual correlation\nwith the level of portal hypertension.\n\nIn addition, in the present study, a ten-\ndency towards a higher interobserver\nagreement was observed in relation to pa-\ntients with a higher number of siderotic\nnodules (category C). In the patients with\nlower number of siderotic nodules (espe-\ncially in those of category A), the main dif-\nficulty found by the observers was the dif-\nferentiation between true nodules and small\nvessels walls; color Doppler US may be\nuseful in this differentiation. In the present\nstudy, however, color Doppler US could\nnot be utilized, considering that this previ-\nously unforeseen difficulty occurred only\nwith some patients evaluated late in the\ndevelopment of the study.\n\nAmongst the differential diagnoses for\nsplenic siderotic nodules observed at US,\ntuberculotic calcified granulomas should\nbe considered. These granulomas tend to be\nlarger and more hyperechogenic than sid-\nerotic nodules, besides presenting an evi-\ndent acoustic shadowing, a feature that is\nnot present in the case of non-calcified si-\nderotic nodules(9), which represented the\nmajority in the present study. Additionally,\nbecause of the paramagnetic effect of he-\nmosiderin products, siderotic nodules are\nclearly visualized on T1- and T2-weighted\nimages as small foci of low-intensity or\nabsent signal and without contrast-en-\nhancement after intravenous gadolinium\ninjection(9,10). Conversely, non-calcified\ntuberculotic nodules tend to present a vari-\n\nable signal on T1- and T2-weighted im-\nages, and most frequently with hyper-in-\ntense signal and ring-shaped contrast-en-\nhancement after gadolinium injection(24).\nCalcified siderotic nodules may not be dis-\ntinguishable from different types of calci-\nfied granulomas, like those resulting from\ntuberculosis and histoplasmosis (9).\n\nAmongst the limitations of the present\nstudy, it is important to note the restricted\nnumber of patients included in the sample,\nas well as the absence of a control group\nwhich would allow the addition of other\nuseful information (for example, specific-\nity, positive and negative predictive values)\nfor determining the US diagnostic accuracy\nin the detection of these nodules. Certainly,\nMRI cost and availability represent a lim-\niting factor for the further expansion of the\nsample. Notwithstanding, it is important to\nnote that the group of patients included in\nthe present study reflects the reality of our\ninstitution, as it may be evidenced by other\nstudies in this same research line(25,26).\nConsidering the lack of previous experi-\nments, the quantitative classification of\nsplenic siderotic nodules was adapted from\na classification proposed for hepatic sid-\nerotic nodules in cirrhotic patients(12), and\nthat was not previously validated in schis-\ntosomal patients. Another type of classifi-\ncation could demonstrate results different\nfrom the ones in the present study.\n\nFinally, just as demonstrated by other\nauthors(4), the present study demonstrated\nthat ultrasonography, besides being a low-\ncost, non-invasive and widely available\nimaging method, is highly sensitive and\nreproducible in the evaluation of splenic\nsiderotic nodules in patients affected by\nschistosomal portal hypertension.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
