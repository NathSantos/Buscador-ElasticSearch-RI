For the \n\nassessment of the touristic value four main criteria were used: a) Availability; b) Use; c) \n\nLogistics; d) Perceptiveness. These criteria include eighteen sub-criteria: 1. Seasonal \n\noccupancy; 2. Terrestrial availability; 3. Availability according with people\u00b4s physical \n\nconditions when the activity is walking or hiking; 4. Boat and/or canoe access; 5. \n\nVisibility; 6. Safety in case of an accident; 7. Safety in the site and its access; 8. \n\nSignage; 9. The current use of the site in terms of geological/historical interest; 10. The \n\ncurrent use of the site for other interests; 11. Use limitations of the site; 12. Cleanliness; \n\n13. Toilets; 14. Restaurants; 15. Accommodation; 16. Local buses; 17. Aesthetics and \n\n18. Interpretative potential. The results obtained following the percentage and points \n\nmethodologies were grouped in five categories for a better guidance: Insufficient \n\n(values between 0% - 49% and 0 \u2013 4.8 points); Sufficient (values between 49.5% - 69% \n\nand 4.9 \u2013 5.9 points ); Good (values between 69.5% - 79% and 6 -7.9 points); Very \n\nGood (values between 79.5% - 89% and 8 \u2013 8.9 points) and finally Excellent (values \n\nbetween 89.5% - 100% and 9 \u2013 10 points). It was possible to find that the average \n\ntouristic value of geosites and gold historical sites is not high using both methodologies, \n\nbeing included in the category \u201cSufficient\u201d (58.34% and 5.86 for the geosites and \n\n59.64% and 5.79 points for the gold historical sites).  Best results in touristic value were \n\nobtained by the other sites, with their average value being included in the \u201cGoo?\u201d \n\ncategory (70.33% and 7.07 points). Analyzing all the 57 sites, the average score of the \n\ntouristic potential was 62.77% and 6.24 points, corresponding to t?? \u201cSuff?c??nt\u201d \n\ncategory in percentage methodology but in t?? ?n \u201cGoo?\u201d cat??ory ?n the points \n\nmethodology.  Based on the data obtained regarding tourism value and degradation risk, \n\nsome actions were proposed to improve the sites. \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nAvalia\u00e7\u00e3o do valor tur\u00edstico dos s\u00edtios do projecto de Geoparque de Ouro da \n\nLap\u00f3nia (Finl\u00e2ndia): avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e promo\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nResumo \n \n\n Os 57 s\u00edtios (24 geos\u00edtios, 25 s\u00edtios hist\u00f3ricos do ouro e 8 outros s\u00edtios) do \n\nprojecto Geoparque de Ouro da Lap\u00f3nia (\u201cGolden Geopark of Lapland\u201d) foram \n\navaliados em termos do seu valor tur\u00edstico e do seu risco de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o. Foram usadas \n\nduas metodologias: pontos e percentagem. Para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do valor tur\u00edstico foram \n\nusados quatro crit\u00e9rios principais: a) Disponibilidade; b) Uso; c) Log\u00edstica; d) Sentidos. \n\nEsses crit\u00e9rios incluem dezoito subcrit\u00e9rios: 1. Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal; 2. Acessibilidade \n\nterrestre; 3. Acessibilidade de acordo com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsicas da pessoa quando a \n\nactividade \u00e9 caminhar ou excursionismo; 4. Acessibilidade atrav\u00e9s de barco e/ou canoa; \n\n5. Visibilidade; 6. Seguran\u00e7a em caso de acidente; 7. Seguran\u00e7a no s\u00edtio e no seu \n\nrespectivo acesso; 8. Sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o; 9. Uso actual do s\u00edtio em termos de interesse \n\ngeol\u00f3gico/hist\u00f3rico; 10. Uso do s\u00edtio para outros tipos de interesse; 11. Limita\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nuso do s\u00edtio; 12. Limpeza; 13. Instala\u00e7\u00f5es sanit\u00e1rias; 14. Restaurantes; 15. Alojamento; \n\n16. Transportes p\u00fablicos; 17. Est\u00e9tica e 18. Potencial interpretativo. Os resultados \n\nobtidos foram divididos em cinco categorias para uma melhor organiza\u00e7\u00e3o: Insuficiente \n\n(resultados entre 0% e 49% e 0 \u2013 4.8 pontos); Suficiente (valores entre 49.5% - 69% e \n\n4.9-5.9 pontos); Bom (resultados entre 69.5% - 79% e 6 \u2013 7.9 pontos); Muito Bom \n\n(resultados entre 79.5% - 89% e 8 \u2013 8.9 pontos) e Excelente (resultados entre 89.5%- \n\n100% e 9-10 pontos). Foi poss\u00edvel verificar que o valor tur\u00edstico m\u00e9dio dos geos\u00edtios e \n\ns\u00edtios hist\u00f3ricos do ouro n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito elevado, sendo inclu\u00eddo na categoria \u201cSuf?c??nt?\u201d \n\n(com 58.34% e 5.86 pontos para os geos\u00edtios e 59.64% e 5.79 pontos para os s\u00edtios \n\nhist\u00f3ricos do ouro). Os melhores resultados foram obtidos pelos outros s\u00edtios, com um \n\nvalor m\u00e9dio inclu\u00eddo na categoria \u201cBom\u201d (com 70.33% e 7.07 pontos). No total, os \n\nvalores m\u00e9dios dos 57 s\u00edtios analisados s\u00e3o de 62.77% e 6.24 pontos, correspondendo \u00e0 \n\ncategoria \u201cSuf?c??nt?\u201d na metodologia da percentagem e \u00e0 categoria \u201cBom\u201d na \n\nmetodologia dos pontos. Com base nos resultados obtidos no que diz respeito ao valor \n\ntur\u00edstico e ao risco de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, algumas ac\u00e7\u00f5es foram propostas no sentido de \n\nmelhorar o valor tur\u00edstico dos s\u00edtios. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nContent \n\n \nAcknowlegdments ...................................................................................................................... iii \n\nAbstract ........................................................................................................................................iv \n\nResumo ......................................................................................................................................... v \n\nContent ........................................................................................................................................ vii \n\nFigure Content ............................................................................................................................. ix \n\nTable Content .............................................................................................................................. xi \n\n \n\n1.

Introduction \n \n\n1.1. Scope, goals and methods  \n \n This work has as main goal to create a quantitative assessment of the touristic \n\nvalue and the degradation risk of the 57 inventoried sites (24 geosites, 25 gold historical \n\nsites and 8 other sites) of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project. The quantification of \n\nthe scientific value of the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites is not included \n\nthough it could be added afterwards to a more effective management of the sites.  \n\nTherefore this work has as main goals: \n\n? The touristic value assessment of the sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nproject. \n\n? Development of proposals for valuing geotourism. \n\n \n\nThe specific goals are: \n\n(i) characterization of the sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project; \n\n(ii) implementation of a quantitative methodology for the touristic value using \n\ncriteria of use and vulnerability; \n\n(iii) development of interpretative material for the sites according to their \n\ntouristic value; \n\n(iv) proposals of improvements in the sites (signs, access, infrastructures, among \n\nothers); \n\n(v) proposal of interpretative trails according to the type of sites and their \n\ntouristic value. \n\n \n \n \n\n1.2. Geoconservation, geotourism and geoparks  \n \nGeoconservation is related with the need of conservation of a certain geosite \n\nwhere the value of the geosite and its threats are taken into consideration, being the \n\ngeoparks an important tool to develop strategies of conservation (Brilha, 2005). The \n\norigins of the geoparks started in June of 2000 when it was created the European \n\nGeoparks Network (EGN) by four members: Res\u00e9rve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n(France); The Petrified Forest of Lesvos (Greece); Geopark Gerolstein/Vulkaneifel \n\n(Germany) and Maestrazgo Cultural Park (Spain), as a volunteer organization with \n\nmutual cooperation and founding from an European program, later under the auspices of \n\nUNESCO the program was extended to all world creating in this way the Global \n\nGeoparks Network (Carcavilla Urqu\u00ed and Garc\u00eda Cort\u00e9s [no date]). On November 2015 \n\nin the UNESCO General Conference, the 195 Member States of UNESCO ratified the \n\ncreation of a new label The UNESCO Global Geoparks, until this moment there is 120 \n\nUNESCO Global Geoparks in 33 countries (www.unesco.org).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Global Geoparks Network (http://www.globalgeopark.org/). \n\n \n\nA geopark is a well-defined territory with clear boundaries where the \n\noutstanding Geological Heritage is the basis for a sustainable strategy to promote the \n\nwell-being of the population and the respect for the environment (Carcavilla Urqu\u00ed and \n\nGarc\u00eda- Cort\u00e9s [no date]). In this way the three main goals of a geopark are: \n\n? Geoconservation: creation of a strategy to preserve and promote the geosites as \n\na way to protect the geological heritage for future generations \n\n(www.azoresgeopark.com). \n\n? Environmental education: creating knowledge and consciousness in \n\npopulation about the importance of the geological heritage as well as promoting \n\nhttp://www.unesco.org/\nhttp://www.azoresgeopark.com/\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nthe scientific research and dissemination, the sharing of the information between \n\nscientists and local community (www.azoresgeopark.com). \n\n? Sustainable development: concerning for the creation of a sustainable \n\ndevelopment and well-being of local population, where the geotourism is the \n\nmain key to give value to geological heritage and cultural heritage while benefits \n\nthe well-being of the local population and where a good geotourism strategy can \n\nbe sustainable (www.azoresgeopark.com). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. Sites value and assessment criteria \n \n\nFor a correct and sustainable management of the geosites it is need to have a \n\nmanagement plan made by six different stages: inventory, quantification, classification, \n\nconservation, promotion and monitoring (Brilha, 2005), the first two stages are related \n\nwith the geosites assessment and the last four are related with their management \n\n(Pereira, 2006). This work is focused in the management (second part of the \n\nmanagement plan) specifically in the touristic quantification of the 24 geosites, 25 gold \n\nhistorical sites and 8 other sites as well as their degradation risk of the Golden Geopark \n\nof Lapland project sites, selected previously in the inventory stage. The quantitative \n\nassessment of the scientific value of the 57 sites is not developed in this work.  \n\nThere are still few works related with the development of a quantitative \n\nmethodology for touristic value like for example Pralong (2005), Ryb\u00e1r (2010), Pereira \n\nand Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013). The present work will do an adaptation from \n\nthe previous works done by Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013) with some \n\nadaptation to the reality of the Finnish Lapland.  \n\nhttp://www.azoresgeopark.com/\nhttp://www.azoresgeopark.com/\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n2. Golden Geopark of Lapland Project \n \n\n2.1. Location and description of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Location of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project (Golden Geopark of Lapland brochure [no date]). \n\n \n\nLapland - located on north of Finland (Figure 2.1.) inside of the Arctic Circle \n\nand heart of a wilderness area \u2013 is home of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project. The \n\ngeopark project has 5125 km2 of area, comprises two municipalities, Inari and \n\nSodankyl\u00e4, and it is home of 24 geosites, 25 gold historical sites and 8 other sites \n\n(Figure 2.2.), the geosites represent the ancient bedrock, gold deposits, the weathering \n\nprocesses and the Quaternary geology, and the gold historical sites and other sites the \n\nrich Gold History of Lapland, the S\u00e1mi Culture and a glimpse of the Lapland War. In \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nthis far north where the geopark is located there is huge contracts during all year round \n\nbeing the summertime with the midnight sun while in wintertime is quite much the \n\nopposite, the night stays for couple months giving origin to the polar nights well known \n\nin Finnish language as \u201cKaamos\u201d. Besides the contrasts between day and night, also it \n\nhas a rich nature where in summer time the ground is made of ground-hugging shrubs, \n\nmosses and lichens, lakes and native birch and pine forest; in autumn the colors of \n\nnature turn to red and yellow  and the time when it starts to get dark \u2013 September - the \n\nbest northern lights begin. In winter, which is the longest season of the year, everything \n\nis covered by snow, hard low temperatures that can reach sometimes -40 degrees \n\nCelsius and the sky gives dark and with luck the famous northern lights, the spring time \n\nthe snow starts to melt and the lighter days announces the coming of warmer days.  \n\nThey were three projects with the aim to establish the Golden Geopark of \n\nLapland being the first one in 2011-2012 under the administration of the Gold Museum \n\nFoundation; the second one from July until December of 2013 under the administration \n\nof Inari Municipal Business &amp; Development Nordica and finally the third from January \n\n2014 until April 2015. After the projects, since January until December of 2015 the \n\ngeopark project operated under Inari Municipal Business &amp; Development Nordica and \n\nfunded by Inari and Sodankyl\u00e4 municipalities and Mets\u00e4hallitus. In September 2015 in \n\nthe European Geoparks Network held in the only Finnish Geopark (Rokua Geopark) \n\nwhen announcing the new geopark members the Golden Geopark Project did not \n\nentered (www.goldengeopark.fi). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.goldengeopark.fi/\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nLegend: \n\n?

Geological Setting \n \n\n In the area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project is possible to observe: a) a \n\nvery old Precambrian bedrock, older than many geoparks in Middle and Southern \n\nEurope; b) weathering processes; c) the Ice Age that left its legacy on top of the old \n\nbedrock and d) the gold deposits that also created a huge historical background in \n\nLapland. \n\n The bedrock of northern Finland belongs to the Fennoscandian Shield, also \n\ncalled Baltic Shield (Figure 2.3.), which is an ancient shield area similar to the Canadian \n\nand Australian shields and it corresponds to the bottom of an ancient mountain range \n\nlike the one nowadays in Alps. The Fennoscandian Shield is in south of Norway, \n\neastern Finnmark, the southern and eastern parts of Sweden, all Finland and parts of \n\nnorthwest of Russia being the oldest rocks of this shield formed between 3.2 and 2.5 \n\nbillion years ago and occurred in eastern Finmark, north-eastern Finland and north-\n\nwestern Russia. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. \u201cGeology and major structural units of the Fennoscandian shield. PAC\u2014Primitive arc complex; WAC\u2014\n\nArc complex of western Finland; SAC\u2014 Arc complex of southern Finland; CFGC\u2014 Central Finland granitoid \n\ncomplex; CLGC\u2014 Central Lapland granite complex; LGB\u2014Lapland granulite belt. Right-diagonal ruling marks the \n\nnort??rn ???? of platform s???m?nts.\u201d (From Koistinen et al. (2001) and Vaasjoki et al. (2005)). \n\n \n\n The area of the Geopark of Lapland is in the Paleoproterozoic Lapland \n\nGreenstone Belt (LGB) where underlies the Archean rocks. The greenstone belts are a \n\ncharacteristic of all Archean terraces of the world (Vaasjoki et al., 2005) and the LGB is \n\nthe largest coherent greenstone terrain exposed in the Fennoscandian Shield \n\n(Schl\u00f6glova et al., 2014) comprising northern Norway, the geopark area and finally \n\nRussia in Kola Peninsula (Johansson [no date]), with 400 km long and 90 km wide \n\n(Tuisku et al., 2006) being the main rock quartz feldspar gneiss (Figure 2.4.). The LGB \n\nhas been affected by the intensive deformed and metamorphosed Svecokarelian orogeny \n\n(a continent-continent collision between the Karelian province and Kola province) of \n\nabout 1.9 billion years ago where volcanic activity took place and the rocks went in the \n\ndeep Earth\u00b4s crust suffering a tremendous pressure and heat, reason for the strong \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nfoliation nowadays in the rocks. It was in this environment described before that gave \n\norigin to the rocks and its minerals in present day. The LGB also presents intercalations \n\nnorites and enderbites (Barbey and Raith, 1990). In the southern part of the geopark it is \n\npossible to observe a younger rock, a granite intrusion of 1.77 billion years old, the \n\nNattaset fells and on the margins of the Granulite belt garnet-hornblende gneiss and \n\nhornblende gneiss (Johansson [no date]). \n\n The Svecokarelian orogeny, besides the rock types in the area of the geopark, \n\ncreated mountains chains that eroded down to its roots during hundreds of millions of \n\nyears giving place to a peneplane - it is important to mention that the erosion and \n\nweathering processes were faster when Finland was in southern parts of the globe \n\n(Johansson [no date]; Tikkanen, 2002). In 30-50 million years ago, in Tertiary period, \n\nthere were block movements that made the fells rose above their surrounding area and \n\nthe fractures zones and faults formed at their edges originated valleys like Ivalojoki, \n\nLemmenjoki, Tolosjoki, among others. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4. Lapland Greenstone Belt (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application). \n\n \n\n The history of the rocks in this area is far from its end, a very important factor \n\nhappened here as well, the weathering. The rocks suffered chemical and mechanical (or \n\nphysical) weathering during millions of years, which made the granulite rock into loose \n\nmaterial, in some places the rock is so loose that is possible to excavate it with a shovel \n\n(Johansson et al., 2009).  Many of this weathering, known as frost weathering, can be \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nseen on the tops of upper slopes of the fells where it is possible to observe a field of \n\nblocks, this happened when the water enters in fractures of the rock, freezes, increases \n\nits size and after that breaks the surface of the rock, examples of geosites are the geosite \n\nnumber 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells, geosite number 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi \n\ncollapsed cliff and other example to observe is on top of the J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 fell. Other rocks \n\nare more resistant against weathering, for example the geosite number 15. Tor \n\nformations at Pyh\u00e4-Nattanen where the weathering has been slower than the \n\nsurrounding area. In other areas the weathered rock, loosened by frost weathering, falls \n\nfrom vertical canyon walls and stays in the shores of the rivers like it happens on the \n\ngeosite number 23. Talus deposit on the shore of Morgamj\u00e4rvi lake. This process \n\n(weathering) is very slow in nature.  \n\n Also the ice age played a crucial rule here. The area has been place for many ice \n\nages during the times, being the oldest signs of glaciation about 2.3 billion years ago \n\n(Luhta, 2003). The last glaciation, the Weichselian Glaciation, is responsible for many \n\nQuaternary deposits (the most common one is till), various landforms and erosional \n\nforms (Figure 2.5.). The Weichselian Glaciation started more than 110 000 years ago \n\nreaching its peak about 18 000-20 000 years ago and ended about 9000 years ago, \n\nhaving at least 10 different stages and the same amount of warm stages, called \n\ninterglacial stage- nowadays we are living an interglacial stage. The northern Lapland, \n\nwhere the geopark project is, the ice melted in a supra-aquatic environment that resulted \n\nin erosional and depositional landforms (Johansson, 2007), different from what \n\nhappened in central and southern parts of Finland, where in south existed subaquatic \n\nenvironment (Johansson, 2007). In this far north only small episodes of subaquatic \n\nenvironment happened here when the Arctic Ocean entered in the river valleys of Teno \n\nand Lutto and into the Inari Lake basin (Nikonov 1964, Saarnisto 1973, cited in \n\nJohansson, 2007 p. 48).  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5. Quaternary  deposits in the area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland ( Golden Geopark of Lapland \nApplication). \n\n \n\nSome examples of evidences of the ice age: \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nEskers: long, narrow hill of gravel and sand which is formed by waters that flow in the \n\nmelting ice penetrating into cracks of the ice and depositing debris on the bottom of the \n\nmeltwater tunnels. The eskers are in the same direction with the melting ice.  \n\nKames: small cone shaped hills made of sand and gravel by the streams on top of the \n\nglaciers.  \n\nSubglacial gorges: very deep and narrow valleys with very steep valley side slope. It \n\nforms when the meltwater of the glaciers and its materials (debris) crosses a fell ridge \n\nand the rock on tunnel floor is already fractured, the water erodes it for a long time \n\nforming in this way deep gorges.  \n\nPotholes: circular or cylindrical hole in the riverbed produced by the force of a very \n\nturbulent water and abrasion. Very turbulent quantities of melt water from a glacier and \n\nits sediments start to spin with the eddy and since it is greater than the resistance of the \n\nrock drills down forming in this way potholes.  \n\nLateral drainage: parall?l \u201cl?n?s\u201d an? slop? ??ntly ?ownwar? form?? ?ur?n? t?? \n\ndeglaciation stage when the ice progressively got thinned each year and eroded a \n\nchannel in the slope parallel to the edge of the ice (Johansson et al., 2009). This \n\nhappened   between the ice margin of the glacier and the adjacent hillside.   \n\nOverflow channels: formed when the ice sheet starts to melt and the meltwater \n\naccumulates between the ice sheet and the lowest parts of the fell, eroding what is in \n\ntheir way and creating deep gorges (Johansson et al., 2009). \n\nAapa mires: areas with large watery flarks and its middle parts without trees, also there \n\nare between them low ridges called strings (Johansson [no date]). This type of mire is \n\nformed when the ice melts and dead plants starts to accumulate in the wet environment \n\nand during thousands of years originates a peat. They can be found in depressions in the \n\nlandscape and in areas with water between hills for example.  \n\nHummocky moraines:  also named as dead-ice moraine or moraine mounds are a \n\ngroup of moraines with no specific orientation or organization, size, spacing or slope.  \n\nGlacial deltas: formed when streams of meltwater coming from the ice entered into the \n\nlakes or when it is associated with an esker chain, being the delta in this way the final \n\nstage of the esker formation. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nMarginal channels: formed in the margin of the ice sheet the same way as the lateral \n\ndrainage, the difference between both rely on the fact that in the marginal channels the \n\nquantity of water is much bigger.  \n\nErratics: a rock/ boulder transported and deposited by a glacier in a different area than \n\nthe original having in this way a different lithology than the bedrock.  \n\n To finalize the geological setting it is crucial to mention the gold plays a very \n\nimportant rule in this area in terms of geology as well as history. Gold is a yellow and \n\nshinning precious metal, being one of the heaviest metals in nature and considered to be \n\na \u201cnobl?\u201d m?tal (an alc??m?st?c t?rm) b?caus? ?t ?o?s not ox???z? un??r or??nary \n\ncon??t?ons. Its c??m?cal symbol ?s \u201cAu\u201d from t?? Lat?n wor? \u201caurum\u201d an? ?t ?s a ?oo? \n\nconductor of electricity and heat. The gold also is used in many other areas such as \n\njewelry, gilding, dentistry, coins, aircraft-aerospace industry, arts, medical and chemical \n\nfields and electronics.  \n\n It is believed this precious metal has extraterrestrial origin which means that \n\ngold is formed when a supernova star explodes or collides and creates all heavier \n\nelements beyond iron (Fe), where the atoms of the gold originated as well. An \n\ninterstellar gas cloud travels into the space and ended up in Earth at about 4.6 billion \n\nyears ago. When the Earth was not in a solid state gold and other heavier elements went \n\nto the centre of the Earth, while lighter elements stayed on the surface.  \n\n The gold was formed during millions of years where it precipitated on the ocean \n\nfloor or into deep volcanoes and it was able to rise high in the mountains. The \n\nweathering and erosion in the mountain region during a period of hundreds of millions \n\nof years and in the Tertiary Period when block movements made the fells rose above \n\ntheir surroundings the gold nuggets detached from the weathering rocks and ended up in \n\nthe crustal faults (Halla and Wuthenau, 2015).  \n\n Other ore formations processes, besides the orogenic (above explained), forms \n\nthe gold in Lapland, like for example porfyric, hypotermic, mesotermic, epitermic, \n\nsedimendic, among others. The sedimentic process has a sub-group, the placer process, \n\nwhich is divided in many placers but here the most important are the glasifluvial, glasial \n\nand alluvial to understand the journey of the gold in this area. Even though there is \n\nplacer gold formations, until today was not found their mother lodges (primary ores).  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Geosites description \n \n\n1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops: in the Ivalojoki canyon is possible to \n\nobserve the strong schistose appearance and mineral content of the granitic gneiss and \n\nquartz diorite gneisses resulted of the tremendous pressure and heat the rock suffered.  \n\nWhen hiking the 12 km trail from Pahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village visitors can \n\nsee this geosite, also on the other side of the river, when crossing the suspension bridge \n\nthat links the two shores is possible to visit the Kultala Gold Village (Golden Geopark \n\nof Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n2. Potholes at Ivalojoen Kultala: the potholes here are about 0.1-1.2 metres deep and \n\nwith a diameter vary between 0.2 and 1.5 metres. They were formed by the last ice age \n\nabout 11,000 years ago in the marginal zone of the melting ice sheet produced by the \n\nforce of the very turbulent water and abrasion where boulders carried by those waters \n\nstarted to spin with the eddy and since this force is greater than the resistance of the \n\nrock drills down forming in this way the potholes. It is possible to see this geosite under \n\nthe suspension bridge that leads to Kultala Gold Village, the geosite belongs to the 12 \n\nkm trail from Pahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: this esker is part of an esker sequence \n\nover 100 km long that extends from south-west to north-east towards Inari Lake and the \n\nvillage of Nellim. From Ritakoski Gold Village down to the river valley, the esker ridge \n\nenlarges into a valley train. This originates due to the glacial river that transports the \n\nsediments and deposited on the bottom of the valley, these eskers reach the surface level \n\nat about 155 m, w??c? ?s t?? wat?r l?v?l of t?? anc??nt ?c? lak? at Inar?. \u201cWhen the level \n\nof the water later lowered, the Ivalojoki river began to carve its channel through the \n\ngravel and sand deposits.\u201d (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n4. The Saarnak\u00f6ng\u00e4s rapids: on the western side of the Ivalojoki river bank there is a \n\nlarge pothole carved in the cliff, also there are more potholes on the banks of the river \n\nwhich depths vary between 0.1 and 0.3 metres and with diameters of 0.2 -0.7 metres. \n\nSaarnak\u00f6ng\u00e4s ?n F?nn?s? m?ans \u201cs?rmon rap??s\u201d ?u? to t?? fact t?at ?t ?s b?l??v?? t?? \n\npriest used this pothole to deliver his sermons to the gold-prospectors of the area \n\n(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n5. The Ainikkaharju esker: it is an esker ridge of 7 km long belonging to a long esker \n\nsequence that extends from south-west to north-east towards the Ivalojoki river valley. \n\nIt was formed when the debris were transported on the bottom of the meltwater channel \n\nand after that deposited as an elongated ridge of gravel and sand (Golden Geopark of \n\nLapland Application [no date]). \n\n6. The Puoliv\u00e4li spring: springs occur mostly on the lower slopes of fells, hills and at \n\nthe foot of eskers when the groundwater reaches the ground surface (Johansson et al., \n\n2009). At the bottom of Patatunturi fell the waters of Puoliv\u00e4li spring goes in its way to \n\nthe surface through the sandy layers on the bottom. This geosite is in the 12 km trail \n\nfrom Pahaoja to Gold Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n7. The Kulmakuru gorge: this gorge has an angular form as a result of the crossing \n\nfracture zones in the bedrock, it is a gorge more than 20 metres deep with very steep \n\nslopes and in the bottom is covered with jagged stones that have fall down from the \n\nslopes. Also in this area there is a small esker ridge formed in the meltwater conduit at \n\nthe bottom of the retreating glacier that goes into the Kulmakuru meltwater gorge at the \n\n375 m level and runs further to the Eskottijoki river valley where there are again \n\nglaciofluvial hillocks, proving in this way that esker ridges and this gorge belong to the \n\nsame sub-glacial meltwater system (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n8. The Kiilop\u00e4\u00e4 ice lake and its spillways: when continental ice sheet from the last \n\nglaciation was melting, about 10, 500 years ago, the ground started to be exposed and \n\nthe water was collected into ice lakes between the margin of the glacier and the fells, \n\nlike it happen in Kiili-oja river valley. This ice lake discharged its waters over the \n\nlowest points of the fell range towards northeast eroding deep gorges (overflow \n\nchannels) into the bedrock (Johansson et al., 2011). North of Kiilop\u00e4\u00e4 exists a series of \n\noverflow channels at heights between 446 m and 336 m which functioned one after the \n\nother as a discharge channel for the Kiilop\u00e4\u00e4 ice lake (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n9. The Rumakuru gorge: this gorge due to its orientation and location was formed \n\nearly than the melting stage of the last glaciation, when the last glaciation was in his \n\narea it was not able to destroy it or fill it, with the exception of the floors and slopes \n\nwhich are partially covered by a thin blanket of till. This gorge has 50 metres deep \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nbecause of the long time of erosion made by the meltwater and the underlying rock was \n\nalready fractured (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  \n\n10. The quartz vein at Hangasoja: when the gold in the riverbanks started to be scarse \n\nthe attention turned to the gold in the bedrock. In this way in 1898, a geological \n\nexpedition was send to search for minerals in Lapland and it was found close to \n\nHangasoja brook a spot where a white quartz vein cut through the syenite bedrock, \n\nconsidering this a very promising chance for gold prospecting, the gold miner Henry \n\nKerkel\u00e4 had the information and made a claim in the place in May of 1902. This geosite \n\nbelong to the Laanila Gold trail were is possible also to see some historical sites \n\n(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n11. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4aapa mire: this mire was formed in the depressions of the terrain and in \n\nwaterlogged areas that were left as the glacier melted. Remnants of dead plants \n\naccumulates on the humid substrate and during a period of thousands of years several \n\nmetres of peat were formed by the process of huminification (Johansson, 2009). The \n\nmire, like the others, is an open bog without tress in the middle, watery flarks and \n\nbetween them  low ridges called strings.  \n\n12. The Kopsusj\u00e4rvi delta: is a glaciofluvial delta that was formed at the margin of the \n\ncontinental ice sheet. There is an esker chain running from south-west representing the \n\nfinal stage of the esker formation, and the delta is composed by sand and gravel material \n\nrising 315 metres above sea level (refers to the water level elevation in the Kopusj\u00e4rvi \n\nice lake during the deglaciation). The sides of the delta are steep and the surface flat \n\n(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  \n\n13. Lateral drainage channels at Ter\u00e4v\u00e4kivenp\u00e4\u00e4: \u201cglacial meltwater channels \nwhich are almost parallel and slope gently down the sides of the fell.\u201d (Ann?x?s, \n\nGolden Geopark of Lapland [no date]). Each channel is few hundreds of metres to a \n\nkilometre long, open at the both ends, 1-3 metres deep and having a distance between \n\nthem that varies between 10 and 20 metres. The lateral channels are very important for \n\ncalculat? t?? annual r?tr?at of t?? ?c? mar??n. \u201cThey were formed in spring by meltwater \n\nflowing from the ice sheet and eroding a channel in the slope parallel to the edge of the \n\nice. When became thinner in summer, its surface sank a few metres. The next spring a \n\nnew channel was again formed below the preceding one.\u201d (Jo?ansson ?t al., 2009). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n14. Melt water erosional forms on Tankavaara fell: when the deglaciation came to \n\nthis area the waters from the glacier crossed Tankavaara fell under an huge pressure that \n\ncarried away rock material that eroded from the walls and the bottom of the gorge and \n\nwere deposited at its mouth. Marginal channels were formed later and since the amount \n\nof water flowing in those channels was huge originated channels with several metres \n\ndeep and frequently over a kilometre long (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no \n\ndate]). \n\n15. Tor formations at Pyh\u00e4-Nattanen: is a group of high cone shaped hills in Sompio \n\nNature Reserve with about 500 metres high being the highest Ter\u00e4v\u00e4-Nattanen with  \n\n544 metres, it belongs to a 1. 77 billion years old granite intrusion that is one of the \n\nyoun??st rock typ?s ?n t?? ar?a. \u201cThe Nattaset fells consist of red, coarse-porphyritic or \n\neven-grained, homogeneous granite that is composed of plagioclase, quartz and K-\n\nfeldspar in equal proportions. Biotite is the main mafic mineral and accessory phase \n\ninclude magnetite, allanite, titanite, and zircon\u201d (Front ?t al., cited in Johansson et al., \n\n2014, p.34). These tors probably belong to the most durable parts of the granitic rock, \n\nbeing the weathering process slower here than in the surrounding area. There is an \n\nhiking trail to this geosite (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: the frost weathering that occurs in this area \n\nmakes the surface of the rock shrink and expand forming in this way small fractures, \n\nafter this the water penetrates on these fractures freezes and widens breaking the rocks. \n\nThis is what happened in this geosite, and still going on in a very slow process. There is \n\na hiking trail to see this geosite as well as to geosite number 15 (Golden Geopark of \n\nLapland Application [no date]). \n\n17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi: in En?l?s? m?ans t?? \u201cb?ar\u00b4s D?n Rock\u201d and it is situated near the \n\nlake My\u00f6ss\u00e4j\u00e4rvi in Inari on the slope of My\u00f6ss\u00e4vaara hill and it is well-known for \n\nbeing the largest cavity of a tafone weathering formation in Finland. When the \n\ncontinental ice sheet flowed to the area, from the southwest, carried with it many \n\nerratics in its melting process, one of the most famous and largest is the Bear\u00b4s Dan \n\nCave with 6m x 6m x 4m in outer extend and 2m x 2m x 3m inside cavity (Johansson et \n\nal., 2014). It is formed through tafoni weathering mainly by disintegration due to the \n\ndifferences in temperature between the surface of the cavity and the inner rock, the \n\nchanges in temperature and humidity still erode the walls of the cavity (Kielosto et al. \n\n1985, cited in Johansson et al., 2014, p. 56). This erratic was before mistaken as a \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\npothole that had been turned upside down. It is possible to visit the inside of the erratic \n\nthrough a hole, there are stairs that lead to this geosite and it is not far from a parking \n\ncar area. \n\n18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s: this area is characterized by tens of \n\nhills and ridges of 5 -15 metres high and composed by very stony and blocky till. The \n\nstones are angular, originating from the local bedrock meaning that the rock underneath \n\nis fractured and the glacial erosion in the area was very strong mixing till with the \n\nangular rocks. (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed cliff: this geosite is a result of physical weathering. When \n\nthere are differences of temperature the surface of the rock expands and contracts \n\nalternately resulting in this way in small fractures in the rock. When it rains the water \n\nenters in this fractures and when temperatures are below zero the water freezes and \n\nexpands in the fractures, after this the fracture becomes so big that the rock splits and \n\nthe break piece rolls down to the bottom of the slope and spilt into dozens of pieces. \n\nThis process is very slow (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n20. The Sotkaj\u00e4rvi esker and kames: this esker is part of a long esker sequence, 150 \n\nkm, running from south-west to north-east rising in Lemmenjoki canyon about 30 \n\nmetres. \u201cAt Njurkulahti, the unbroken, steep-sided ridge enlarges into rolling kame \n\ntopography consisting of several parallel ridges. Dead ice holes are found between \n\nthem that formed as ice blocks transported by the meltwater stream were buried in the \n\ngravel.\u201d (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n21. The Ravadask\u00f6ng\u00e4s waterfall: this geosite has several falls in a row being \n\noriginally an old glacial meltwater channel. In addition, there is in the upper part of the \n\nwaterfall potholes-like forms made by the erosive action of the glacial meltwater in the \n\nfinal phase of the last glaciations. The Ravadask\u00f6ng\u00e4s gorge and the 7 metre high \n\nwaterfall cascade situated near the mouth of the Ravadasjoki river are a very famous \n\ndestination in Lemmenjoki, being possible to see this geosite through a hiking trail or in \n\nan easier way by boat (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n22. A cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream: three small waterfalls with \n\ntheir steep and narrow channels indicating the brooks are young. The highest and most \n\nimpressive is situated at the mouth of the Morgam-Viibus stream. (Golden Geopark of \n\nLapland Application [no date]).  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n23. Talus deposit on the shore of Morgamj\u00e4rvi lake: the talus deposit on the south-\n\neastern shore of Morgamj\u00e4rvi lake are the result of the physical weathering, having the \n\nmaterial fallen from the vertical canyon walls and came to the lower parts of the canyon \n\nforming in this way talus deposits. Rock and snow avalanches in late winter are also \n\ncommon events in this area.  \n\n24. Lateral drainage channels on the top of the J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 fell: \u201cglacial meltwater \n\nchannels which are almost parallel and slope gently down the slopes of the J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 \n\nfell\u201d (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).). Each channel is a few \n\nhundreds of metres to a kilometre long, open at the both ends and 1-3 metres deep. The \n\nlateral channels are very important for calculate the annual retreat of the ice margin. \n\n\u201cThey were formed in spring by meltwater flowing from the ice sheet and eroding a \n\nchannel in the slope parallel to the edge of the ice. When became thinner in summer, its \n\nsurface sank a few metres. The next spring a new channel was again formed below the \n\npreceding one.\u201d (Jo?ansson ?t al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6.

Gold History: Past and Present \n \n\n Even though the discovery of gold in Lapland had a shy start with some failed \n\nattempts (the oldest reference about gold dates back in 1546 by Georg Agricola), its \n\nofficial beginning came much later, in 1868 in Ivalojoki River and continued after that \n\nin other areas like Lemmenjoki, Laanila and Tankavaara bringing a new fascinating \n\nchapter in Lapland History. Nowadays visitors can see some buildings, ruins, engines, \n\nshafts, piles of stones, among others in the gold fields throughout the good hiking trails \n\nin the area, like for example Lemmenjoki trail (49, 20 km all hiking route, shorter if \n\nvisitors take boat and hike for a while), Pahaoja \u2013 Kultala Gold Mining Village trail (12 \n\nkm) and the Golden Route of Laanila  (8.10 km); pan for gold in some places and \n\nunderstand a little bit more of gold history thanks to the International Gold Museum of \n\nTankavaara.   \n\nIvalojoki: the gold was found in 1868 in Nulkkamukka by Joahn Conrad Lihr (a mining \n\nengineer and the manager of the Mint) and his team and the gold rush reached its climax \n\nGeosite n\u00ba21 Geosite n\u00ba22 \n\nGeosite n\u00ba23 Geosite n\u00ba 24 \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nin 1880s (http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm).

Nowadays the area has \n\nthe Gold Village with restaurant and accommodation and the Gold Museum. In his \n\nmuseum visitors can find the history of gold in Lapland and in other countries around \n\nthe world and some temporary exhibitions are developed, like for example the one \n\nwhich explains geologically the origin of gold in Lapland. Besides these two \n\ninfrastructures \u2013 Gold Village and Museum- a Mineral exhibition and \u201cAuraria\u201d (a \n\nsquare with scale model replicas of buildings from gold rush centres all over the world) \n\ncan be seen in Tankavaara.

Near \n\nthis place, at the Timanttik\u00f6ng\u00e4s rapids there is a traditional S\u00e1mi-style dwelling, a \n\n\u201cKammi\u201d, which has been dug partially underground and lined with timber and peat \n\nalso there is a sauna and an underground cellar (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]).  \n\n2. Ruikanmutka: this place has been one of the most productive gold sites on the river \n\nIvalojoki. Here many gold prospectors staked their claims due to its richness, being \n\nUnto Koivunen the most recent permanent gold prospector in this area living in his \n\ncabin all year round. It is possible to s?? t?? r?ma?ns of Ko?vun?n\u2019s ol? ?ut, \n\nchimneyless sauna, cold cellar, shed and outhouse in Ruikanmutka. The newer hut \n\nburned down in 1995. Also here was built a big house but few evidences have been \n\npreserved until these days, the house belonged to Matti Yliruikka which found so much \n\ngold that made him able to build here a house (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application \n\n[no date]). \n\n3. The Lappi Farm at the Mouth of the Appisjoki: in this place lived the Lappish \n\nfamily of Gabriel Aikio at the beginning of the 20th century. Gabriel sold food and other \n\nsupplies to local gold prospectors who paid their purchases in gold (Launonen and \n\nPartanen, 2000). According to the legend, he hid his gold by the path running from the \n\nmouth of Appisjoki to Kultala. Only two more people knew it where it was, his \n\nfarmhand and his maid, when Gabriel died the maid went in search for the treasure and \n\nfound it but gave her such a fright that she fled from the side. Until this day the gold is \n\nstill there if the rumors are truth. This place is in ruins  (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\nhttp://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n4. Kultala Crown Station: on the spring of the year 1868 the Senate send an official \n\nexpedition led by Joahn Conrad Lihr, a mining engineer and the manager of the Mint, to \n\nexplore the rivers of Lapland to find gold and on September of the same year the \n\nprecious metal was found on the River Ivalojoki in a place called Nulkkamukka \n\n(http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm), giving in this way birth to the gold rush in \n\nLapland. The gold rush in Ivalojoki took about 3 summers with an amount of 500 gold \n\ndiggers, some of them were lucky enough to get 2 kilos of gold in a short period of time \n\n(couple weeks). With the huge number of prospectors in the area it was necessary to \n\nkeep the order and support people\u00b4s needs in the gold fields, in this way in 1870 on the \n\nbank of Ivalojoki river many infrastructures were created like for example the Kultala \n\nCrown Station, the headquarters for government officials to control the area (e.g.: \n\nissuing licenses for gold prospecting, purchased all the gold recovered on the claims, \n\nplotted maps of the claims, etc.), as well as a sauna, a saloon, a bakery, log cabins to \n\naccommodate gold prospectors and a small hospital built further down on this river. \n\nWhen the gold rush was over, the Kultala building was renovated to serve as an \n\ninvestigation centre for Finnish geophysicists to study northern lights in 1882. It is \n\npossible to visit this place and see the buildings through the 12 km hiking trail from \n\nPahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no \n\ndate]). \n\n5. The River Bank of the Sotajoki Confluence: at the mouth of Sotajoki people have \n\nbeen here to prospect for gold since the early days of the gold rush (1870s). The first \n\nperson to stake a claim at the mouth of Sotajoki was Johan Tallgren from Helsinki being \n\nthe results of the first 10 years over 30 kilos of gold. In 1879 Tallgren sold his claim to \n\na baker, Fredrick Ekberg, founder of Helsinki\u00b4s well-known Ekberg\u00b4s coffee house. At \n\nthe end of the 1880s the northern bank of the mouth of Sotajoki was claimed by \n\nXenofon Nordling the head of the Ivalo-Sotajonen huuhdontayhti\u00f6 gold panning \n\ncompany where several-kilometre-long ditches along which water was led from the \n\nSotajoki to the panning site and huge piles of rock, the ruins of the cabins and huts also \n\nprobably date back to those days. Also two mining companies, Prospector Oy and \n\nIvalojoki Oy, worked in this area (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  \n\n6. The Liljeqvist Dredge and its Surroundings: the engineer Toivo Liljeqvist built \n\nthis large dredger (known also as \u201ct?? ??nosaur\u201d) ?n 1953-54 in Tolonen and dragged it \n\nalong a cable wire upstream to the Vaskisuvanto backwater, it had a bucket and an \n\nhttp://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nextractor operated by a diesel-powered engine. It was believed the machine could \n\ncollect gold from the river that was left in the ground from digging by hand but the \n\ndredge did not worked as planned. The dredge was abandoned being gradually damaged \n\nby the years and floods in spring time, fortunately in 1992 this incredible machine was \n\nrestored. Nowadays is possible to see this machine on the shore of Vaskisuvanto \n\n(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  \n\n7. Ritakoski\u2019s Kultala Gold Village: Ritakoski has been a very important location for \ngold prospecting. Feodor Oesterreich of Saint Pertersburg was the first who staked a \n\nclaim in this area, quitting quite soon after his bad results of prospecting. The busiest \n\ntimes came with Heikki Kivek\u00e4s in 1914 who had big plans to this place, building all \n\nkinds of houses in the place like for example a cowshed, stable and a barn as well as a \n\nsauna, a mining cabin, a timber hut, a workshop, a peculiar dog house that stood on a \n\npedestal, a sawmill and a planning mill. He also started to build his own gold village but \n\nhe never managed to finish. After Kivek\u00e4s was the time for mining companies like for \n\nexample Ivalojoki Oy and Luttojoen Kulta Oy, the second company mentioned here \n\nemployed, among others, Laura Francisca Elvira Bono, known as Moppe. She was a \n\nwife of a famous Finnish painter, she had a private little cabin at the bank of Ritakoski. \n\n(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). Of the old buildings in this area, the main building, a \n\nstorehouse and the cowshed and stable were restored being the storehouse used as a hut \n\nfor hikers. The doghouse and the log restroom also can been seen until nowadays, the \n\nrest of the buildings are in ruins around the place.  \n\n8. Ritakoski steam engine: the steam engine was made by the English company R. \n\nGarret &amp; Sons Engineers from Leiston with the main goal of starting a major mining \n\nactivity. This machine was carried to Ritakoski during winter time, through a wide path \n\nstamped by reindeers, in a sleigh transported by horses and the river Ivalojoki was \n\ncrossed on the ice. The steam engine is in an open shelter possible to be visited (Golden \n\nGeopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n9. Palsinoja (Raahe cabin): Palsinoja is a tributary of the river Ivalojoki, having the \n\ngold history started here in 1871 when an engineering student, Johan Albert Piponious, \n\nstaked a claim along Palsinoja, near the mouth of the tributary, and panned almost 100 \n\ngrams of gold in the first few days. Next summer Piponius sold the claim to the police \n\nofficer Xenofon Nordling who hired 25 men to work on the claim and received 3.4 \n\nkilograms in gold. Slightly higher upstream along Palsinoja, Anders Lepp\u00e4luoto, a \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nsailor from Raahe, staked his claim in the summer of 1873 and had a crew of eleven \n\npeople to dug up more than two kilos of gold at the claim. The workers from Raahe left \n\nbehind a hut, known as Raahen Pirtti, on the site. The hut was renovated in 1980 decade \n\nand again in 2012 serving today as a Mets\u00e4hallitus rental hut and other remnants of old \n\nbuildings built by the men from Raahe can be seen in the area. A road to Palsinoja was \n\nbuilt in 1980 decade and a former helicopter pilot, Heikki Korhonen, established a \n\ntourism centre and an automated gold panning facility by the river, the business was a \n\nsuccess but in autumn of 1985 the Katriina cabin that served as the touristic caf\u00e9 burned \n\ndown coming to an end his career in this area. Until today gold prospectors continue to \n\nwork in Palsinoja (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n10. Nulkkamukka - the Birth Place of the Gold Rush: the Senate of the then Grand \n\nDuchy of Finland send an expedition led by Johan Conrad Lihr, assistant Director of the \n\nMint and mining engineer, in 1868 to explore the big rivers of the north in hopes to find \n\ngold. On 16th of September of 1868 gold was found and a new chapter in Ivalojoki \n\nregion started with this. With the discovery of gold in this area, the International Gold \n\nProspector Museum of Tankavaara erected in 1986 a monument in honour of Lihr, \n\nlocated about 300 metres up-stream from the mouth of Louhioja and it can be seen until \n\nnowadays (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n11. Kultala (Gold Village) along Pahaoja Brook: gold digging in the area became \n\nmore efficient when the company Lapin Kulta Oy built a base in this area in 1925. The \n\ngold prospecting through machines made that railways, bucket conveyors and steam \n\npower machines were transported here, unfortunately without success - not much gold \n\nwas found and rocks made the mechanical digging difficult. In 1948 a team of gold \n\nprospectors, Jaakko Isola, Heikki Kokko, Kullervo Korhonen and Jukka Pellinen in \n\nhigh hopes to find more gold collected an huge amount of land mines, grenades and \n\nother explosives abandoned by the German army few years earlier. The explosives were \n\ndug into a long row, wired together to explode and for the explosion it was used a \n\nbicycle dynamo. This experiment was not succeed as expected and these gold \n\nprospectors moved the following year to the gold fields of Lemmenjoki (Launonen and \n\nPartanen, 2000). The 300 metre channel that was exploded across a spit of land \n\ndownstream from Pahaoja brook is an evidence of their activities that can be still seen \n\nuntil nowadays. As this place was abandoned when other areas in Lapland were more \n\nappealing to search for gold, the buildings fell into ruin and in 1970s by the initiative of \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nthe Lapin Kultala Foundation, the National Board of Antiquities renovated the buildings \n\nand a shelter was built for the steam engine and a suspension bridge across the River \n\nSotajoki, also a trail was created (12 km long) to link this place with Kultala Crown \n\nStation. To see this site, visitors walk short path and easy and is quite near to a parking \n\nplace (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).   \n\n12. The Kerkel\u00e4 mining village: t?? ma??c wor? \u201c?ol?\u201d spr?a? ?n t??s ar?a and gold \n\nmining companies came to try their luck. Henry Kerkel\u00e4 (an experienced gold \n\nprospector who worked as a miner in America and searcher for rock gold in the \n\nIvalojoki gold fields) founded the Kerkel\u00e4n Kultakaivos Oy Pohjola gold company \n\nhaving in 1902 150 claims and employing 45 men but without any success (only 25 \n\ngrams of gold were found). Due to his failure, the shareholders hired Hans von Post, a \n\nmining engineer, from Stockholm to inspect the job sites and Hans after take several \n\nsamples conclude that there was a very few amount of gold in the area. Even though the \n\nresults were unsatisfactory, von Post advised to Kerkel\u00e4 continue to prospect because \n\nhis lack of success may have been due to this lack of experience, inadequate equipment \n\nand the methods used. The report made by von Post did not convince the partners and \n\nthe business was closed, still some of the shareholders had faith in Kerkel\u00e4 and he was \n\nable to establish another mining company that soon proved to be hopeless. Kerkel\u00e4 \n\nmanaged to sell his mine in 1906 to the Finnish-American Mining company, involving \n\nthe Joutsen brothers, two men who had struck it rich in Klondike gold fields. This \n\ncollaboration ended up in the courthouse of Inari, where  the company was sued for \n\nhundreds of thousands of marks in unpaid shares. The six mine shafts in the area and \n\nremnants of a dam and a building of Kerkel\u00e4 can be seen in this area through the 7 km \n\ntrail, Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]; Launonen \n\nand Partanen, 2000). \n\n13. The Laanila white quartz rock and shaft: the discovery of gold brought many \n\npeople into the gold fields to try their luck and also the curiosity to find the mother \n\nlodge. In 1898 the geologist J.J. Sederholm detected syenite and quartz seams that cut \n\nacross each other by the Hangasoja brook and decided it could be better to have a look \n\nin this area. When Kerkel\u00e4 was in the area he had a mine shaft that reached a depth of \n\n10 metres and he said he had seen quartz, iron glance and gold in the cracks of the \n\ngranulite gneiss. Before other people could prove what he was saying the shaft filled \n\nwith water. Kerkel\u00e4 dug another 125 metres from the previous one and found large \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\namounts of gold, in this way he continued to dig more shafts finding iron ore seams and \n\nsend the samples to be analyzed. The analyzes concluded that the gold in the samples \n\nwas significant and people believed in the mother lodge of Lapland. This gold historical \n\nsite belongs to the 7 km Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application \n\n[no date]). \n\n14. The Kuivakuru panning facility: this gold historical site is one of the most famous \n\nand richest gold panning areas, being many of the largest nuggets in Finnish gold \n\nprospecting history found here. Here is possible to observe ruins of several old cabins \n\nand a newer one built in 1960s and still used by gold prospectors in 2000s, as well as \n\nsteam-powered machines and more modern ones. This site belongs to the 7 km Lannila \n\nGold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n15. General\u2019s mine shaft: gold digging is still an active activity in present days in \n\nnearby areas of this gold historical site. The mine mineral of the shaft is goethite having \n\non the waste area of the shaft plenty of goethite crystals. This site belongs to the 7 km \n\nLaanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft: this site is located near Kuttura road, probably the name \n\ncomes from Carl-Gustaf Standertskj\u00f6ld, one of the shareholders of the mining company \n\n(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). The best samples were proven to have more than 50 \n\ngrams of gold per tonne. Digging was quite intensive in this site and the deepest shafts \n\nin the area are found here. In this way is possible to see here the shafts and pile of waste \n\nstone. This site belongs to the 7 km Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n17. Prospector\u2019s mine shaft: the Prospektor Oy mining company was established in \n1901 influenced partially by the promising gold findings of Henry Kerkel\u00e4. The \n\ncompany acquired 470 claims with the goal of prospecting for rock and river gold. As in \n\nthat time the place was in pure wilderness the company had to build living quarters for \n\nworkers and clerks, laboratories and smelters. Other important detail to live in such a \n\nremote area was the creation of roads, organization of post and food deliveries and have \n\neducated engineers. In 1902 the company employed 78 men and the most important of \n\nthe six shafts was in Laanila, which employed 30 men. As the company paid to its \n\nemployees, the machinery as well as payments for research expeditions in America, the \n\nmoney problem started to appear and to solve it was needed to convince the \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nshareholders that more gold would be found. The company received more money and in \n\nthis way more machines were bought and more workers hired. The mining focused \n\nmainly on the shafts by the Luttojoki and Hangasoja, reaching the Lutto shaft more than \n\n50 metres and the Carl Gustaf shaft by the Hangasoja more than 30 metres. The \n\ncompany ran out of money again despite the efforts and the mining company had to sell \n\noff its equipment and the funds collected from the selling and those collected from \n\nshareholders allowed the company close with honor. The trails in Saariselk\u00e4 area and \n\nLannila lead to this site. It is possible to see the Prospektor mining shaft which is inside \n\nof a cabin and in the surrounding area some objects and a pile of stones from the \n\nprospecting activity (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  \n\n18. The old cabin at Suomunruoktu: this site is in the Urho Kekkonen National Park \n\nand has witnessed many different uses. It is believed that originally was built as a sauna \n\nfor gold prospectors in 1935 being in the following decade renovated for hiking \n\npurposes and in the war time was used as a military patrol base. Today is a historical \n\nsite from the national park (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: in Tankavaara the gold was found thanks to a \n\ndream that Aslak Peltovuoma (a smith and joiner) had. In his dream there was an old \n\nman with white beard showing him a place to find gold. As he used crutches, Aslak sent \n\nhis nephew  to the place he dreamt about but the boy came back without any gold \n\n(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). In this way Aslak went himself to the place and for his \n\nsurprise he found gold and after his discovery the deposit of gold was worked by people \n\nfrom Aslak village and later outsiders also went to explore the place staking their claims \n\nhere. \n\n20. Kultahamina: is the starting point for the Gold Trail in Lemmenjoki National Park. \n\nHere people can reach the site by tourist boat or by hiking (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n21. The site where gold was first found: Lemmenjoki had its first gold experience in \n\n1902 without any further success, being this area forgotten for four decades. Only in \n\n1945 when three brothers, Niilo, Uula and Veikko Rantilla found gold in the tributary of \n\nMorgamoja (Lemmenjoki), this area entered in the gold History of Lapland. With the \n\ndiscovery of gold by the three brothers the news spread out bringing in this way more \n\ngold prospectors to the area and originated the gold rush in Lemmenjoki. A small metal \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nplaque is mounted on a stone near the site of the discovery. The site belongs to the \n\nLemmenjoki Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n22. Morgamoja Kultala: the site is famous for receiving four famous gold diggers, \n\nJukka Pellinen, Heikkki Kokko, Kullervo Korhonen and Jaakko Isola. Being the cabin a \n\ncentral spot during the gold rush times it housed a post office, cafeteria and even a \n\ngeneral store. From the original buildings, only the traditional Lapland storehouse, \n\nsauna and cellar still exist and the existing hut was constructed to resemble the old \n\ncabin. This belongs to the Lemmenjoki Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]).  \n\n23. Pihlajam\u00e4ki: this site is valuable for its old buildings and structures which includes \n\nthe Pihlajam\u00e4ki cabin, a traditional storehouse from Lapland, a sauna, a cellar for \n\nsmoking fish and meat, a swing and a doghouse, besides this buildings and structures, \n\ngold prospecting objects are on display on the yard. A machine to prospect gold is still \n\nworking in this area. People can reach this place by hiking (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]).  \n\n24. Karhu Korhonen\u2019s Library: near J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 fell stands the former service building \nof the J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 fell wilderness airfield owned by the Union of Lapland Gold \n\nProspectors and the Finnish Transport Safety Agency/Trafi. This building is well known \n\nas \u201cKar?u Kor?on?n L?brary\u201d or the J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4 Cultural Centre, having inside books that \n\nhikers can borrow and in return, if they want, leave their own books for others to read. \n\nPictures about gold prospecting are in the walls. A trail leads to this site (Golden \n\nGeopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n25. Korhonen: this gold historical site has the cabin of the late gold prospector Yrj\u00f6 \n\n\u201cKar?u\u201d Kor?on?n an? it is the operational machine prospecting area of Joukko \n\nKorhonen.

This indigenous people are more and more in \n\ntourism sector due to the recent decline in reindeer herding and the increase of interest \n\non tourism entrepreneurship showed by younger S\u00e1mi (Pettersson, 2007). In this way \n\nS\u00e1mi people are in the tourism sector increasing and developing activities such as \n\nguiding, handicraft, exhibitions, among others and the area of the geopark is inside of \n\ntheir land. Actually one of the main S\u00e1mi towns is also inside of the geopark area, Inari \n\nvillage, and Siida Museum is a partner of the future geopark. This Museum which is a \n\nmuseum which shows to the visitors the culture of these indigenous people and the \n\nnature of northern of Lapland (the permanent exhibition) also it shows changing \n\nexhibitions on culture, art and nature all year round and in summer time there is an \n\noutside exhibition where visitors can find many different types of constructions like \n\n\u201ckota\u201d, house for horses, traps for some animal, house, etc. Also the geopark has some \n\nsites to represent the S\u00e1mi culture like for example the Ukonsaari Island, the Pielpaj\u00e4rvi \n\nWilderness Church, the Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up and the ground of Kaapin Jouni \n\nsite. \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Other Sites description \n \n\n1. The korkia-Maura Ice Cave: this cave is famous for its permafrost. The layer of ice \n\non the bottom of the 15 metre long, 1-3.5 metre wide and 1.5-4 metre high cave never \n\nmelted for hundreds of years. This kind of permafrost is called microclimatic permafrost \n\nand can be seen in caves, eskers and mines. This is formed when the winter cold is \n\npreserved throughout the summer, but in the recent years this cave has begun to thaw \n\nduring summer due to the heat that visitors bring with them. This place also was known \n\nas a fish cellar for fisherman of Inarij\u00e4rvi in the old times. This cave is in an island on \n\nthe Lake Inarij\u00e4rvi and in summer visitors can go to visit the cave with a local boat and \n\nin spring (when the ice is still hard) with skis (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application \n\n[no date]). \n\n2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site: this is a site representing the S\u00e1mi culture and \n\nthe traditions of their ancestors like the reindeer husbandry. It comprises buildings and \n\nstructures that gives the idea how people lived and still live. The fences and the cabins \n\nwere restored in late 1980s and the structures are protected as a monuments to S\u00e1mi \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nreindeer husbandry with valuable industrial and cultural history. There is a 6 km hiking \n\ntrail that leads to this place (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n3. The Pitfalls at the Sotkaj\u00e4rvi Ridge Chain: settlements in river valleys have been \n\nchosen since the prehistoric times. Here is possible to see signs of human activities from \n\nhundreds of years ago, being found about 700 pitfalls used for hunting wild forest \n\nreindeer until 1800s. In the village of Njurkulanti the main source of livelihood today is \n\nstill reindeer herding and tourism. The trail to this place starts in Njurkulahti village and \n\nit is well-marked (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n4. Ruijanpolku trail: this trail has 35 km being the starting point in Laanila and its end \n\nin Sompioj\u00e4rvi Lake. This trail was originally part of an ancient route named \n\nRuijanreitti which before ran from the Botnian Bay, cross Saariselk\u00e4 fell area and all the \n\nway to Finnmark by the Arctic Ocean, and it is believed to be the oldest route in \n\nLapland (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).   \n\n5. The Grounds of Kaapin Jouni: this site is the homestead of a famous S\u00e1mi family, \n\nbeing Jouni Aikio (better known as Kaapin Jouni) the most well-known man of the \n\nfam?ly. H? was t?? \u201cr??n???r lor?\u201d of ??s t?m? an? t?? ??a? of t?? fam?ly. H?s fam?ly \n\nwas not the first who lived here, being the founder of the homestead Antti Juhaninpoika \n\nMorottaja, the homestead was established on late 19th century and remained occupied \n\never since. The last member of the founding family moved away from the homestead in \n\n2004. The buildings and the homestead are preserved. It is possible to see this place \n\nwith local enterprises (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). \n\n6. Pielpaj\u00e4rvi Wilderness Church: this church was built in 1760 and it is one of the \n\noldest buildings in northern Lapland. This church is the old centre of the old winter \n\nvillage of Inari. This church and the nearby areas form a nationally valuable cultural \n\nheritage area. To reach this church there is a well- marked hiking trail with few \n\nkilometres (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).    \n\n7. Ukonsaari Island: this site is the most famous sacred place for worshiping amongst \n\nS\u00e1mi people in Finland. Families and individual people made sacrifices on this place \n\nuntil the 19th century and it is known that reindeer antlers were still brought here later. \n\nFishermen, according with some legends, used to throw a coin in the Lake Inarij\u00e4rvi \n\nclose to this island and wish for fair winds. Also it was found a silver filigree head \n\njewelry belonging to a lady\u00b4s circlet, which was not worn in Finland or in the rest of the \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nNordic countries, similar jewelry was worn in Russia in 13th century and it is believed \n\nthe circlet may have come in a barter deal to Inari \n\n(http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/ukonsaariisland). Today it is an important site to S\u00e1mi \n\npeople, an archeological site and a touristic destination, been proposed to made into a \n\nUNESCO world heritage site for its cultural values. It is possible to visit this island \n\nthrough a boat connection from Inari village to the island (Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nApplication [no date]). \n\n8. Geological Trail: the trail has 7 km, is marked and presents information boards \n\nexplaining the geology during the trail. In this trail hikers learn about the geological \n\nevolution of the area including information about gold as well as mires, weathered \n\nbedrock and Quaternary deposits formed by the continental ice sheet and its meltwaters \n\n(Johansson et al, 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.8.

Touristic Value Assessment \n\n3.1. Methodology  \n\n3.1.1. Touristic Value Assessment \n\nT?? scarc? numb?r of works r?lat?? to ??os?t?s\u2019 tour?st?c valu? ass?ssm?nt may \n\nreflect the little attention that has been given to this subject by geopark managers and \n\nresearchers. This work intends to be a contribution to that theme, following previous \n\nproposals by Pralong (2005), Ryb\u00e1r (2010), Pereira and Pereira (2012) or Gon\u00e7alves \n\n(2013). Regarding the reality and specificities of the Finnish Lapland environment, the \n\napplied methodology was slightly modified from these proposals, mainly from those of \n\nPereira and Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013).  \n\nThe touristic value assessment was applied to the 24 geosites, 25 gold historical \n\nsites and 8 other sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project and the same criteria, \n\nsub-criteria and scores (Table 3.1.) were used for all sites (57 in total) for a better \n\ncomparison between them. Four main criteria were used: A. Availability, B. Use, C. \n\nLogistics and D. Perceptiveness (with some subjectivity, depending on the sensitivity \n\nand understanding by the person who is seeing the site). Each of the main criteria is \n\ndivided in sub-criteria. The \u201cA. Availability\u201d criterion includes six or seven (depending \n\nif the site has boat and/or canoe access or not) sub-criteria: A.1 Seasonal Occupancy \n\n(Pralong, 2005); A.2. Terrestrial Accessibility; A.3. Availability according with \n\npeople\u00b4s physical conditions when the activity is hiking or walking (adapted from \n\nRyb\u00e1r, 2010); A.4. Boat and/or canoe access (optional); A.5. Visibility; A.6. Safety (in \n\ncase of an accident); A.7. Safety in the geosite/gold historical site/other site and its \n\naccess. The \u201cB. Use\u201d criterion includes four sub-criteria: B.1. Signage; B.2. The current \n\nuse of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site in terms of geological/historical interest; \n\nB.3. The current use of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site for other interests and \n\nB.4. Use limitations of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site for other interests. The \n\n\u201cC. Lo??st?cs\u201d criterion includes five sub-criteria: C.1. Cleanliness, C.2. Toilets; C.3. \n\nRestaurants; C.4. Accommodation; and C.5. Local buses. The \u201cD. Perceptiveness\u201d \n\ncriterion includes two sub-criteria: D.1. Aesthetics and D.2. Interpretative potential. A \n\nscore ranging from 0 to 10 was used, where 0 is the minimum and 10 the maximum \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\npoints for each sub-criteria, making the total of 170 or 180 points (depending if a site \n\nhas or not the boat/canoe access). \n\nFrom the criteria proposed by Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013) \n\nnew sub-criteria were added. In the criterion \u201cA. Availability\u201d four new sub-criteria \n\nwere created: A.1. Seasonal Occupancy, A.3. Availability according with people \n\nphysical conditions when the activity is hiking or walking, A.4. Boat or canoe access, \n\nand A.6. Safety (in case of an accident). The sub-criterion \u201cA.1. Seasonal Occupancy\u201d \n\nhad to be considered here since the Golden Geopark of Lapland has some sites that can \n\nbe closed in winter time and sometimes in other seasons as spring and autumn due to \n\nthe thick snow cover and the potential danger linked with that, like for example \n\navalanches. It is also important to refer that, in some cases, when a site has open-access \n\nall year round it is very important to check every time the safety of the site when \n\nplanning a trip. Sometimes the site can be safe to visit in winter but in some night or \n\nweek it snowed more than the usual and it can happen to be closed due to the high \n\nquantities of snow, danger of an avalanche, trees possible falling due to the huge weight \n\nof snow, among others. In this sub-criterion it was not possible to check if the sites \n\nwhich are closed in winter time could be open in winter and if they were safe to be open \n\nin this time of the year. Other sub-criterion added in the criterion \u201cA. Availability\u201d was \n\n\u201cA.2. Availability according with people\u00b4s physical conditions when the activity is \n\nhiking or walking\u201d. It was important to add this sub-criterion since the area of the \n\ngeopark is a wilderness area full of good hiking trails and most of the sites are far, \n\nrequiring a hike to be seen. The addition of the sub-criterion \u201cA.4. Boat and/or canoe \n\naccess\u201d was also considered necessary because some sites can be visited during summer \n\ntime only by boat and/or canoe, like the case of  Korkia-Maura ice cave and Ukonsaari \n\nIsland. Other sites can be visited by aquatic and terrestrial access, boat and/or canoe and \n\nby car or hiking. Unfortunately it was not possible to add a sub-criterion about the \n\n\u201cavailability according to people\u00b4 physical conditions when the activity is canoeing\u201d \n\nlike it was made for hiking and walking. Another item added was the criterion \u201cA.6. \n\nSafety (in case of an accident)\u201d, which is related with the possibility of a visitor to call \n\nan ambulance or go to a near hospital when suffering an accident. Even in the summer \n\ntime it is possible to face some risks like for example getting lost. Wild animals like \n\nwolves and bears live in the area of the geopark but they weren\u00b4t take into account in \n\nthis method since the attacks from those animals are extremely rare and they are afraid \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nof humans. In the criterion \u201cC. Logistics\u201d the sub-criterion \u201cC.5.Local bus?s\u201d was \n\nadded, since the distances in Lapland are very long and the public transportation is \n\nscarce, worthing the consideration of this item. In the criteria \u201cB. Use\u201d and \u201cD. \n\nPerceptiveness\u201d the sub-criteria were the same used in the original proposal (Pereira and \n\nPereira, 2012; Gon\u00e7alves, 2013).  \n\n  Besides adding new sub-criteria, the items of some sub-criteria proposed in \n\nPereira and Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013) were changed to better adapt to the \n\nreality of Finnish Lapland. In the \u201cA.2. Terrestrial accessibility\u201d the ?t?m \u201ct?? acc?ss to \n\nthe geosite/gold historical site/other site is possible but the route in winter time is longer \n\nthan the other used in the rest of the year\u201d was added. It is due to the fact that some \n\nroads in winter are closed or transformed into snowmobile routes. Besides, the term \n\n\u201cforest vehicle road\u201d is used to describe those roads where cars can go but are made \n\nwith gravel. In the sub-criterion \u201cA.5. Visibility\u201d t?? ?t?m \u201cT?? v?s?b?l?ty of t?? \n\ngeosite/gold historical site/other site is good to all or the most important \n\ngeological/historical element(s) even with snow and darkness (in the dark it is used \n\nart?f?c?al l???t to obs?rv? t?? ??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?/ot??r s?t?)\u201d was a????. The \n\nvisibility in winter time was considered since some geosites/gold historical sites/other \n\nsites can be quite difficult to see in this time of the year while others are easily seen \n\neven in the dark hours and/or covered with snow, with a support of an artificial light. In \n\nthe sub-cr?t?r?on B.2. \u201ct?? curr?nt us? of t?? ??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal site/other site in \n\nt?rms of ??olo??cal/??stor?cal ?nt?r?st\u201d ?t was ??c???? to join the internet promotion and \n\nthe information board in same item \u201c??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?/ot??r s?t? w?t? \n\ngeological/historical promotion only in internet and leaflets, books, maps and/or in the \n\nsite, e.g.: informat?on boar?\u201d. R??ar??n? t??s, Gon\u00e7alves (2013) proposed that the \n\ninformation panels should be more valued than the internet and leaflets. Our proposal is \n\nrelated to the fact that mostly of the sites are in the wilderness far away from the main \n\nroads and putting there an information board could affect the sensation of wilderness \n\nBesides, the maintenance cost of this boards in such far areas is quite high. In the sub-\n\ncr?t?r?on \u201cB.3. The current use of the geosite/gold historical site/other site for other \n\ntyp?s of ?nt?r?sts\u201d the types of hiking trail, sky trail and boat and/or canoe route were \n\nconsidered, as well as their circularity by the possibility of the visitors to leave the car \n\non the same place without doing an extra walk or route to get into the transportation. In \n\nthe sub-criterion \u201cC.1.Cl?anl?n?ss\u201d som? a?aptat?ons were also considered as necessary \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nto be closer to the reality of Lapland. The infrastructures for making pic-nicks and the \n\npossibility to swim were desconsidered being only mentioned the existence of rubbish \n\nbins on or near the sites. In the sub-criteria \u201cC.3. R?staurants\u201d an? \u201cC.4. \n\nAccommo?at?on\u201d t?? influence of seasonality led to the necessity of adaptions because \n\ninfrastructures like restaurants and hotels can be closed in specific times of the year. \n\nOther minor changes were made from the Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves \n\n(2013) proposals, as presented in the Table 3.1.   \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

Degradation Risk \n\n Also the degradation risk was taken into consideration in this work to help to \n\nhave a clearer idea of the sites with higher and lower risk of degradation. The \n\ndegradation risk here will be related with the probability of the geological and historical \n\nfeatures being damaged or destroyed due to human activity and due to natural processes. \n\nThis procedure is important for a clearer and better management, where the degradation \n\nrisk shows sites with low degradation risk and high touristic potential should be \n\npromoted being in this way in tourism plans like for example new routes, interpretative \n\ninformation, among others; on the other hand, sites with high degradation risk, even if \n\nthey have high touristic potential, should be promoted only after being created \n\nconditions for protection and conservation (Brilha, 2005).    \n\n In the degradation risk the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites will have \n\nthe same criteria, sub-criteria and scores. The proposal chosen here was from Brilha \n\n(2016) with some adaptations to better represent the reality of the area of the Golden \n\nGeopark of Lapland. It was used five main criteria: \u201cA. Legal Protection\u201d; \u201cB. \n\nProximity to areas/activities with potential to cause degradation\u201d; \u201cC. Deterioration of \n\nthe geological/historical elements\u201d; \u201cD. Prox?m?ty w?t? v?lla??s, cities and touristic \n\nplac?s\u201d; \u201cE. Accessibility\u201d with the sub-criteria: \u201cE.1. Terrestrial accessibility\u201d and \n\n\u201cE.2; Accessibility by boat and/or canoe\u201d. In terms of scores it was used a score from 0 \n\nto 10, where 0 is the minimum and 10 the maximum points, for each criteria and sub-\n\ncriteria making the total of 150 or 160 points (depending if a site has or not the boat \n\nand/or canoe access). On the criterion \u201cB. Proximity to areas/activities with potential to \n\ncause degradation\u201d ?a? to b? a???? t?? ?t?m \u201csmall scal? ???ra??n? ar?a/act?v?ty \n\n(?xampl?: ?ol? ?????n?)\u201d b?caus? ?ol? ?????n? can\u00b4t be compared with other big \n\nindustrial mining activities. In gold digging the use of machines is extremely rare and \n\nthere is an huge environmental control on this activity being a very green type of gold \n\ndigging (only water from the rivers is used not being aloud any kind of chemicals, when \n\nfinishing the activity it is a rule to leave the landscape clean and in its original state \u2013try \n\nto put it equal of what it was before the digging activity-, among other many rules \n\nwhich help to protect the environment, not forgetting to mention that the gold digging is \n\nonly possible during summer time). The big industrial mining activities are outside of \n\nthe geopark area and the urban areas are quite small populated being mostly small \n\nvillages and quite far from each other, there are no railways and there is only a main \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nroad (highway E75) which runs close to the east edge of the area of the geopark and \n\nother small roads link to the main road, making in this way the area of the geopark in \n\nwilderness.

T?? last cr?t?r?on \u201cE. Acc?ss?b?l?ty\u201d was ??v???? ?n two sub-criteria \n\nas some sites are easier to reach by water than terrestrial access or the only way to visit \n\nthem is via a boat and/or canoe or by land.

Terrestrial accessibility (7.5%) Score \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located less than 100 metres from a paved \n\nroad with a bus parking area. \n10 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located less than 100 metres from a paved \n\nroad. \n7 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located less than 100 metres from a forest \n\nvehicle road or geosite/gold historical site/other site located between 100-500 \n\nmetres from a paved road. \n\n5 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located more than 100 metres from a forest \n\nvehicle road or geosite/gold historical site/other site located more than 500 metres \n\nfrom a paved road. \n\n1 \n\nE.2. Accessibility by boat and/or canoe (7.5%) Score \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located less than 100 metres from a boat \n\nand/or canoe place. \n10 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located between 100-500 metres from a boat \n\nand/or canoe place. \n7 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located between 500 metres and 1 km from a \n\nboat and/or canoe place. \n5 \n\nGeosite/gold historical site/other site located more than 1 km from a boat and/or \n\ncanoe place. \n1 \n\n \n \n\nThe quantification of each geosite, gold historical site and other site was based \n\non two numerical methodologies: points and percentage, like it happened in the touristic \n\nvalue assessment of the sites. The use of two numerical methodologies is important to \n\ncompare the similarity (or not) of the results. The points methodology considers a \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nweight of 20% to the criterion \u201cA. Legal Protection\u201d; a weight of 20% to the criterion \n\n\u201cB. Proximity to areas/activities with potential to cause degradation\u201d; a weight of 35% \n\nto the criterion \u201cC. Deterioration of the geological/historical elements\u201d; a weight of 10%  \n\nto the criterion \u201cD. Prox?m?ty w?t? v?lla??s, cities an? tour?st?c plac?s\u201d; and finally, a \n\nweight of 15% to the criterion \u201cE. Accessibility\u201d. The last criterion was divided in two \n\nsub-criteria \u201cE.1. Terrestrial accessibility\u201d and \u201cE.2. Accessibility by boat and/or \n\ncanoe\u201d, where each one have a weight of 7.5%. If there is no boat and/or canoe access \n\nthe sub-criterion E.1. will have a weight of 15%.  \n\nThe final score of the site is the result of the sum of the points given to each item \n\nmultiplied by the weight of each sub-criterion. The other type of numerical \n\nquantification (the percentage) uses the sum of each score, divide for 150 points or 160 \n\npoints (depending if the site has or not boat and/or canoe access) and multiply by 100.  \n\nAfter these calculations, it is necessary to have guidelines to express the results, \n\nmeaning if a geosite, gold historical site and other site is low, medium or high regarding \n\nof degradation risk.  \n\nFor this, different categories are considered (Table 3.4.) where: \n\n100%-49.5% or 10-4.9 points (in red color) ?n??cat?s t?? s?t? ?s ?n \u201cH??? \n\nDan??r\u201d meaning is the worst scenario for a site and rules of protection and \n\nconservation are a must before promoting the site to the public;  \n\n49%- 36.5% or 4.8-3.9 points (in orange color) the site is in \u201cDanger\u201d meaning \n\nrules of protection and conservation are still necessary and the site here should be the \n\nnext ones to take care of after the sites in \u201cH???

Results  \n\n The assessment of the touristic value and the degradation risk of all geosites, \n\ngold historical sites and other sites (57 in total) are expressed in the tables 3.5 to 3.10. \n\nTo perform this assessment various field trips were made in the field, with some made \n\nin the month of October of 2015 but mostly of them in May, June and July of 2016. \n\nSome sites were checked in winter time (December) to confirm if they were open or not \n\nbecause of the winter season. The field work form and record performed to each site is \n\npresented in the Annexe I. The distances between the sites and other places were made \n\nwith the help of the website http://www.retkikartta.fi. For the assessment of the \n\ndegradation risk the website http://gtkdata.gtk.fi/kaivosrekisteri/ was used to see where \n\nthe gold panning places were and to measure the distances between the gold panning \n\nsites and the sites.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.retkikartta.fi/\nhttp://gtkdata.gtk.fi/kaivosrekisteri/\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nTable 3.5.

Degradation Risk  \n\nIn the degradation risk was used both methodologies too, percentage and points, \n\nfor the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites, the only difference between the \n\ntouristic value assessment and the degradation risk assessment is that in the touristic \n\nvalue assessment when higher the results better the site in terms of touristic potential, in \n\nthe degradation risk is exactly the contrary, when lower the results better the site, \n\nmeaning that it can be promoted to the public but if there is an high value the site has to \n\nbe taking care of instead of being promoted to the public. \n\n \n\nDegradation Risk of the Geosites \n\nA) Percentage Methodology \n\nHere is possible to observe that none of the geosites was ?ns??? of \u201cH??? \n\nDan??r\u201d category, only one ?n t?? \u201cDan??r\u201d category with 45% (18.

A good option could be the final \n\nranking developed by Pereira (2006) who created a ranking obtained due to the sum of \n\nthe positions of each indicator (the touristic value, the scientific value and the \n\ndegradation risk) being the final value better ranked when lower is the value of this \n\nsum. Below there is a simple example of the final ranking made for the other sites only \n\nfor the percentage methodology and only with the touristic value and degradation risk. \n\nIf in the final ranking there are two sites with the same value, one thing that could make \n\nthe difference is the degradation risk, in this way the one which had less degradation \n\nrisk stays higher in the ranking than the one with higher degradation risk.

In the percentage methodology, the average \n\nof the gold historical sites was 59.64% and the geosites was a little bit less, with \n\n58.34%, but in the points methodology the geosites has higher points, 5.86 points than \n\nthe gold historical sites with only 5.79 points. Both methodologies makes the average of \n\nthe geosites and gold historical sites inside of the category of \u201cSuff?c??nt\u201d.  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nIn the degradation risk when comparing separately the average of the 24 \n\ngeosites, 25 gold historical sites and 8 other sites, it shows that the gold historical sites \n\nhad the highest degradation risk average in both methodologies, with 33.29% and 3.51 \n\npoints being both in the cat??ory of \u201cMo??rat?

Geotourism promotion \n \n\nWhen thinking about Finnish Lapland and the Golden Geopark area, tourists are \n\nattracted by the wilderness and by the very different environment being the nature \n\ntourism a key of development for Lapland since the beginning of the 1980s \n\n(Pashkevich, 2014). In summer time tourists (mostly from Finland) are interested in \n\nexplore the wilderness doing hiking, camping, canoeing and gold panning; in autumn \n\ntime is mostly the autumn colors that gives to the landscape colors like red and yellow \n\n(majority are Finnish hikers); in winter and spring time the snowy environment and \n\nnorthern lights are sold with activities like snowmobiling, skiing, snowshoeing, reindeer \n\nand husky safaris and the famous Santa Klaus, attracting mostly foreigners (Pashkevich, \n\n2014).  \n\nIn terms of  the area of the geopark and related with geotourism, it is possible to \n\nsee some trails \u2013being or not geosites - with some information board with geological \n\nexplanation like for example in Tankavaara Geological trail, Lemmenjoki trails and in \n\nsome of Saariselk\u00e4 trails (Figure 4.1.). Besides the geological trail of Tankavaara, the \n\nInternational Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara has a temporary exhibition with \n\nthe explanation of how gold came to our Planet and to Finland and has a mineral \n\nexhibition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Geological information on the trails of Tankavaara (a) and (b); Lemmenjoki (c) and Saariselk\u00e4 (d); \n\nexhibition in the International Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara with the explanation of the origins of gold (e). \n\n \n\nRelated with published materials already developed about geological \n\ninterpretation and/ or geotourism in the area of the geopark, the first steps took place \n\nwith two geological outdoor maps with guide books. The first map was created in the \n\nyear 2000 and covers the western part of Urho Kekkonen National Park and Ivalojoki \n\nar?a \u201cKultakaira Ivalojoki-Saariselk\u00e4 Geological Outdoor Map 1: 50 000\u201d (Figure 4.2. \n\n(a)) and the second was developed two years later from the area of Lemmenjoki \n\nNational Park (Figure 4.2.(a)), on these maps is showed rock types and glacial and \n\npostglacial formations (Johansson et al., 2015) as well as gold historical sites, some \n\ntouristic infrastructures like campfires, parking places, information boards, marked \n\ntrails, accommodation, among others. The guidebook explains geology, gold history \n\namong other important characteristics of each place. Other publication was taken in \n\n2014 w??n a ?u???book \u201cBar?nts Tour for G?otour?sts\u201d ?n English, Norwegian, Finnish \n\nand Russia languages was created to explore nature, landscape history and geological \n\nsights comprising northern Norway and Finland and north-western Russia, where it is \n\ndescribed 26 places in those countries with a circular route\u2013 14 in Finland, 4 in Norway \n\n(e) \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nand 8 in Russia with the main goals to preserve the nature (biotic and abiotic) and make \n\npeople aware of the nature and its features (Figure 4.2. (b)). Other materials are \n\npublished by the Geological Survey of Finland for the general public.  \n\n \n\n   \nFigure 4.2. Geological guide books and maps (a) and a guidebook comprising northern Norway and Finland and \nnorth \u2013western Russia (b).  \n\n \n\nBesides the information boards and published materials, also in some guiding \n\ntours like for example in Tankavaara when visitors pan for gold, they receive geological \n\ninformation from a geologist. During the gold panning activity it is compared the \n\nweight of gold with other materials (Figure 4.3. (a)); an explanation of gemstones that \n\nvisitors can find in their pan (Figure 4.3. (b)) and comparison between different types of \n\ngold from Finland and other countries (Figure 4.3. (c)). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. Material presented while visitors pan for gold in Tankavaara. \n\n \n\nIn this way it is possible to see inside of the area of the geopark are already some \n\nactions made to interpret the geology and develop the geotourism, the creation of the \n\ngeopark will improve the information and services. \n\n \n\n4.1. Priority actions in the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites \n \n\n As the Golden Geopark of Lapland is still a project \u2013 at its beginning stage - \n\nsome of the cr?t?r?a ???n\u2019t ?a? so ?oo? r?sults, this is the reason the work developed \n\nbelow analyzes every single criteria (from the tables 3.5 to 3.10) and see which are the \n\ncriteria that could be improved through the creation of some solutions for the geosites, \n\ngold historical sites and other sites. In this way this will increase the touristic value and \n\nminimize the degradation risk.  \n\n(c) \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Touristic Value Assessment  \n \n\nTouristic Value Assessment of the Geosites \n\nIn all four criteria the ones which had better average was D. Perceptiveness with \n\n7.37 points, next A. Availability with 6.36 points; B. Use with 6.12 points and finally C. \n\nLogistics with 4.15 points. When the four main criteria have different weights is \n\npossible to observe the A. Availability had 3.76 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.66 points \n\nin 1 point; C Logistics 1.02 in 2.5 points and finally in the criterion D. Perceptiveness \n\n0.36 points in 0.5 points.  \n\n \n\nA. Availability (60%):  \n\nA.1. Seasonal Occupancy (20%):  \n\n More than half of the geosites (sixteen) had 5 points due to the fact they open \n\nonly two seasons, the rest of them \u2013 8 geosites \u2013 open all year round. So none of the \n\ngeosites had the minimum points 2.5 (open one season) and none had 7.5 points (open \n\nthree seasons). This happens because many sites are quite danger to visit in winter time \n\nand also some of them are quite expensive to maintain open in this season, only very \n\nfew which are closed in winter could be changed and be open all year round.  This sub- \n\ncriterion received as an average of 6.6 points or 1.32 points in a maximum of 2 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.1.: \n\n? 17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi: open all year round instead of two seasons, making the \n\ncleaning of the snow from the stairs which lead to the cave and the cave itself, \n\nhaving 10 points instead of 5 points. \n\n? 19. Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed cliff: open all year round and clean the road and \n\nparking place, having 10 points instead of 5 points.  \n\n \n\nThese two sites could be open all year round, in this way the average would not \n\nchange so much but it could get 7.08 points or 1.41 points in a maximum of 2 points. \n\n \n\nA.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) \n\nThis sub-criterion had a considerable number of geosites (8 geosites) located \n\nmore than 4 kilometres from a paved road or a forest vehicle road  (3 points) due to the \n\nfact that many are integrated in hiking trails. Three geosites had 1 point, 3. The \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nIvalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids, 4. The Saarnak\u00f6ng\u00e4s rapids and 22. A cascade at \n\nthe mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream because it is very difficult to visit them, the only \n\nway is to cross the river and there is no bridges, the only safer way to go is by boat or \n\ncanoe; the geosite n\u00ba 7. The Kulmakuru gorge had only 2 points because in summer \n\ntime the trail is shorter (a little bit more than one kilometre) than the one in winter time \n\n(more or less 8 km). Three geosites had 4 points (between 2 and 4 km from a paved \n\nroad or forest vehicle road); four geosites had 5 points (between 1 and 2 km from a \n\npaved road or forest vehicle road). Only five geosites were about 1 km and less than 1 \n\nkm, and none reaching the maximum points, 10 points.  \n\nIn general the geosites are quite far forcing a hike, making the average of this \n\nsub-criterion 4.08, which is not so high, or 0.102 points in 0.25 points.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.2.:  \n\n? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: construction of a bridge for \n\npeople to cross the river, if this is possible it will have instead of 1 point, 5 \n\npoints;  \n\n? 4. The Saarnak\u00f6ng\u00e4s rapids: construction of a bridge near this geosite, having \n\nin this way instead of 1 point, 3 points. \n\n \n\nRelated with the distances, it is quite difficult to change them, the only thing that \n\nwas possible to do was improve the access when this one is no so easy, like it happen \n\nwith the geosite number 3 and 4 above mentioned. The average here also doesn\u00b4t \n\nchange so much but it could have 4.33 points or 0.108 points in 0.25. \n\n \n\nA.3. Availability according with people\u00b4s physical conditions when the activity is \n\nhiking or walking (2.5%) \n\n In this sub-criterion none of the geosites received the lowest points (1 point: \n\nbeing very difficult to reach the geosite only for people with excellent physical \n\nconditions) starting with thirteen geosites with 5 points (moderate difficulty, at least \n\ngood physical condition); four with 7.5 points (geosites are easy to hike or walk not \n\nrequiring huge physical conditions), in the geosite number 3. The Ivalojoki esker at \n\nToloskoski rapids is difficult to cross the river and it is not a good idea to do it, the \n\nhiking is very short and easy. A good quantity of geosites, seven, were very easy even \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nfor children, receiving in this way 10 points. Making the average of this sub-criterion \n\n6.87 or 0.17 points in 0.25 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.3.:  \n\nHere nothing was changed because it depends mostly of the person\u00b4s good \n\nphysical conditions or not, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child \n\ncan manage to do some small distances, and mostly of the paths are in good conditions \n\nonly having in some of them longer distances, rocky places and some with parts \n\nrequiring more physical effort.  \n\n \n\nA.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) \n\n In this sub-criterion there were 10 geosites with boat and/or canoe access and the \n\nrest of them no boat and/or canoe access at all. The ones which have the option of boat \n\nand/or canoe, three geosites where situated more than 4 km from a boat and/or canoe \n\nhaving in this way the lowest points (1 point); one between 1 and 2 km (5 points); one \n\nbetween 500 metres and 1 km (7 points);  one between 50 and 200 metres (9 points) and \n\nfour reaching the maximum points (10 points) which are located less than 50 metres \n\nfrom the boat and/ or canoe, making this sub-criterion with a good average of 6.4 or \n\n0.16 points in 0.25.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.:  \n\n Also here nothing could be done because it is impossible to change the distance \n\nbetween a canoe and/or boat place and the geosite. \n\n \n\nA.5. Visibility (2.5%) \n\nThe results here were very satisfactory, starting with two geosites  with 5 points, \n\nmeaning the visibility is medium requiring a closer look to see better the geosites; three \n\nwith 7 points where the visibility was good to all geological elements; a big number of \n\ngeosites, sixteen, had an excellent view to all geological elements (9 points) and the \n\nonly geosites with the maximum points (10 points) being the visibility good even with \n\nsnow and darkness were three because they were the only ones even covered with snow \n\nit was possible to observe them, they are: 7. The Kulmakuru gorge; 9. The Rumakuru \n\ngorge and 14. Melt water erosional forms on Tankavaara fell. This sub-criterion had \n\nquite good results being the average 8.54 points or 0.21 in 0.25 points. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.:  \n\n? 17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi: if it is possible to open this geosite all year round, the \n\nvisibility will be also improved because to access this geosite the entrance has to \n\nbe clean and the cave too, in this way it will have instead of 9 points, 10 points. \n\n? 22. A cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream: as the only way is \n\ngoing by canoe or boat to see this geosite and there are trees covering the \n\ngeosite, one possibility is to cut some trees and other vegetation which hides this \n\ngeosite. In this way the geosite instead of 5 points could reach 9 points. \n\n \n\nThe rest of the geosites don\u00b4t need improvements due to the good results on this \n\nsub-criterion and the ones which are impossible to observe in winter time is  not \n\npossible to do something because of the high danger on doing it and in some cases the \n\nimpossibility to provide a better visibility in winter time but if the geosites above could \n\nbe improved (geosites number 17 and 22) this sub-criterion could have an average of \n\n8.75 points or 0.21 of 0.25 points. \n\n \n\nA.6. Safety \u2013 in case of an accident (15%) \n\n As many geosites are in the wilderness, the distances are quite long to reach \n\nthem, the phone coverage many times does not exist and to access an hospital is quite \n\ndifficult because it is far, these were the reasons why this sub-criterion didn\u00b4t had so \n\ngood average. This sub-criterion doesn\u00b4t mean the geosites are dangerous or safe to \n\nvisit, it means in case of an accident or emergency if it is easy to call the emergency \n\nnumber and go to hospital. In this way there are eleven geosites with 1 point meaning \n\nthe sites are without any safety facilities, no mobile phone coverage and more than 50 \n\nkm from the nearest hospital; two with 2 points, geosites with no safety facilities, more \n\nthan 50 km from the nearest hospital but with mobile phone coverage; two with 3 \n\npoints, geosite with safety facilities but no mobile phone coverage and more than 50 km \n\nfrom the nearest hospital; one with 5 points, geosite with safety facilities, mobile phone \n\ncoverage but more than 50 km from the nearest hospital; seven with 7 points, geosite \n\nwhithout any safety facilities but with mobile phone coverage and located less than 50 \n\nkm from the nearest hospital and finally the best ranked was geosite number 17. \n\nKarhunpes\u00e4kivi with 9 points having safety facilities, mobile phone coverage and \n\nlocated less than 20 km from the nearest hospital. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n This sub-criterion had very low results making it with an average of 3.5 points or \n\n0.52 in 1.5 points.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: \n\n? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: the creation of a bridge to cross \n\nthe river, in this way it could have instead of 7 points, 8 points. \n\n? 15. Tor formations at Pyh\u00e4-Nattanen: this geosite doesn\u00b4t  need a safety \n\nfacility but in its access is necessary because near this geosite there is a block \n\nfield that visitors have to cross to reach the tor formations and when it is raining \n\nor starts to have ice it is quite slippery making it necessary to create for example \n\na wooden boardwalk. In this way it could have instead of 2 points, 5 points.  \n\n? 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: as this is a block field, when it rains \n\nor there is frost it is quite danger and very slippery, so it could be important to \n\ncreate a wooden boardwalk in this geosite, making it instead of 2 points, 5 \n\npoints. \n\n? 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed cliff: some stairs to make easier the access of the \n\ngeosite and a fence to protect people from the falling rocks from the cliff, in this \n\nway it could have instead of 7 points, 8 points. \n\n \n\nRelated with the cellphone coverage and the hospitals, nothing can be done. \n\nSome geosites didn\u00b4t had safety facilities but they are not dangerous. In this way with \n\nthe improvements above described the average could rise a little bit, being 3.83 points \n\nor 0.57 in 1.5 points. \n\n \n\nA.7. Safety in the geosite and its access (15%) \n\nThe safety in the geosite and its access had better results than the safety in case \n\nof an accident (A.6.). This sub-criterion starts with one geosite with 5 points (site with \n\nmoderate danger) geosite number 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed cliff where it is advised \n\nto have some attention when it comes to be closer to the geosite, some rocks can fall, \n\nand when there is snow more danger is added. Three geosites with 6 points having \n\nmoderate danger in their access; four with 8 points, means the geosite requires a little \n\nbit of precaution and the access is safe; nine sites with 9 points, being the access safe \n\n(requiring a little bit of precaution) and safe geosite. Finally, seven geosites reached the \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\nmaximum points (10) being the geosite as well its access safe. This sub-criterion \n\nreached a high average with 8.58 or 1.28 on 1.5 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: \n\n? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: the creation of a bridge to cross \n\nthe river and a good well-marked trail, in this way it could have instead of 6 \n\npoints, 10 points. \n\n? 5. The Ainikkaharju esker: there is no marked trail to this geosite making it \n\ndifficult to find if a person doesn\u00b4t have good orientation skills, so it will be \n\nimportant to have a well-marked trail that leads to this geosite, in this way the \n\ngeosite instead of 6 points could have 9 points. \n\n? 11. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4aapa mire: there is no marked trail to this geosite making it \n\ndifficult to find if a person doesn\u00b4t have good orientation skills, so it will be \n\nimportant  to create signs showing in a clear way where the geosite is, in this \n\nway instead of 6 points, the geosite could have 8 points. \n\n? 15. Tor formations at Pyh\u00e4-Nattanen: this geosite doesn\u00b4t  need a safety \n\nfacility but in its access is necessary because near this geosite there is a block \n\nfield that visitors have to cross to reach the tor formations and when it is raining \n\nor starts to have ice it is quite slippery making it necessary to create for example \n\na wooden boardwalk, in this way it could be instead of 9 points, 10 points.  \n\n? 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: as this is a block field, when it rains \n\nor there is frost it is quite danger and very slippery, so it could be important to \n\ncreate a wooden boardwalk in this geosite, making it instead of 8 points, 10 \n\npoints. \n\n? 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed cliff:  some stairs to make the access easier and a \n\nfence to protect people from the falling rocks from the cliff, in this way it could \n\nhave instead of 5 points, 10 points. \n\n \n\nHaving the geosites above improved the average can reach 8.58 or 1.28 points to \n\n9.29 points or 1.39 in 1.5 points. \n\n \n\nB. Use (10%) \n\n \n\nB.1. Signage (2%) \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\n As the geopark is at the beginning stage, none of the geosites have yet the sign \n\nsay?n? \u201c??os?t?\u201d, some of them which has some kind of sign are not well signed, others \n\ndon\u00b4t have signs at all and few have clear signs making this sub-criterion not so good \n\nranked. Twelve geosites had 0 points due to the fact that there is no signs in the access \n\nroad to the geosite neither in the geosite, making it quite impossible to locate; two \n\ngeosites with 2.5 points, with sings only in the access roads; two with 5 points, which \n\nmeans there is signs only near the geosite or in the geosite; and finally, eight reached the \n\n7.5 points which means there is signs in the main road which lead to the site and in the \n\nsite showing it as a touristic place or a geological site; none reaching the maximum \n\npoints (10 points: signs showing it is a \u201cgeosite\u201d). The lack of signs in access roads to \n\nthe geosites and also in the geosites gave a very low average in this sub-criterion, only \n\nwith 3.12 points or 0.06 in 0.2 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: \n\n? All the geosites must ?av? t?? s??n say?n? \u201c??os?t?\u201d of the Golden Geopark and \n\nas there is only a main road in the geopark that links to secondary ones it is \n\n?mportant to put ?n t?? ma?n roa? (E75) s??ns say?n? \u201c??os?t?\u201d an? ?n t?? roads \n\nthat leads to the geosites. Related with the trails, mostly of them have a board \n\ninformation at the starting point of the trail being important to mention the \n\ngeosites on them. \n\n \n\nThis is a sub-criterion that can have 10 points or 0.2 in 0.2 points, having in this \n\nway the maximum points. \n\n \n\nB.2. The current use of the geosite in terms of geological interest (2%) \n\n Fortunately this sub-criterion was good, being all geosites (24 geosites) with 7.5 \n\npoints meaning that the geological information is in internet, leaflets, maps, books and \n\nalso in some board information, not having reached the 10 points - an interpretative \n\ncentre for the geosites. In this way it had an average of 7.5 points or 0.15 in 0.2 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.2.: \n\n? Having a small interpretative centre for example in Tankavaara Visitor Centre or \n\nin the mineral exhibition from Tankavaara International Gold Museum or other \n\npartner with a space to do an exhibition, could rise the points from 7.5 or 0.15 to \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\n10 or 0.2 points but of course it is not a must cause the information is already in \n\ninternet, leaflets, books, maps and it is very easy to access. \n\n \n\nB.3. The current use of the geosite for other types of interest (2%) \n\n In this sub-criterion none of the geosites had the minimum points (0 points) - \n\nany kind of type of interest, promotion and/or use; starting with four with 1 point, \n\ngeosite with other types of interest but without promotion and/or use; eight geosites \n\nwith 3 points, meaning that the geosite is integrated in a non-circular walking trail and \n\nski trail or non-circular trail (walking or ski trail) and non-circular boat/canoe route; five \n\ngeosites with 5 points, geosite integrated in a circular walking trail or sky trail or geosite \n\nintegrated in circular boat/canoe route; four with 7 points, meaning that the geosite has a \n\ncircular walking trail and ski trail or circular trail (walking or ski trail) and circular \n\nboat/canoe route. None having 9 points, meaning the geosite has other type of interest, \n\nwith promotion but not use; the best points (10) geosite with other type of interest(s), \n\npromotion and use being here three geosites. This sub-criterion had an average of 4.41 \n\npoints or 0.08 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: \n\n? 5. The Ainikkaharju esker: this geosite is not signed at all, so it could be \n\nimportant to create a well-marked trail showing this geosite, having in this way \n\ninstead of 1 point, 3 points. \n\n? 11. The N\u00e4lk\u00e4aapa mire: the creation of a small hiking trail to see this geosite, \n\nin this way it could have instead of 1 point; 3 points. \n\n?  18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s and 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi \n\ncollapsed cliff: the creation of a circular hiking trail to link these geosites and \n\nthe 17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi geosite too, it could be developed two routes - one \n\nsmaller and other bigger - linking those three geosites, having in this way \n\ninstead of 1 points, 5 points. In the future a circular ski trail could be also \n\nimplemented here having in this way 7 points the geosites n\u00ba 18 and n\u00ba19. \n\n \n\nWith small improvements this sub-criterion can have 5.12 points or 0.10 in 0.2 \n\npoints and if the geosite number 17, 18 and 19 can have a circular hiking trail and ski \n\ntrail the average will rise a little bit more reaching 5.29 points or 0.10 points in 0.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nB.4. Use limitation of the geosite (4%) \n\n The sub-crierion of use limitations has a really good score with most of the \n\ngeosites being possible to visit without any restrictions (10 points), only one had \n\nrestrictions like private property (2.5 points: 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids) \n\nand two had physical restrictions (7.5 points: like fences, obstacles). This sub-criterion \n\nhad maximum of 9.47 or 0.37 points in 0.4 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: \n\n As this sub-criterion had really good average nothing was changed. The geosites \n\nwith physical restrictions are possible to be visited and even the 3. The Ivalojoki esker \n\nat Toloskoski rapids has private properties before reaching the geosite is still possible to \n\nbe visited and there is the option of canoe where there is no private properties to cross. \n\n \n\nC. Logistics (25%) \n\nC.1. Cleanliness (5%) \n\n Here the results were satisfactory, there weren\u00b4t dirty geosites, full of rubbish \n\nspread all over the place giving a bad look to the site. All the geosites were clean, and \n\nthe ones with less points, seven geosites with 5 points, were clean only without rubbish \n\nbins; the majority of the geosites, fifteen geosites, had 7.5 points, meaning that the \n\ngeosites were clean without a rubbish bin but they were located less than 5 km from the \n\ngeosite. Only two reached the 10 points, meaning that the geosite had rubbish bins. This \n\nsub-criterion had an average of 6.97 or 0.34 points in 0.5 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: \n\nHere nothing needs to be changed, of course to reach the 10 points all the \n\ngeosites must have a rubbish bin but as all the geosites are clean even if they don\u00b4t have \n\na rubbish bin, it is not so important to improve this sub-criterion.  \n\n \n\n \n\nC.2. Toilets (5%) \n\nHere the results were in the middle (not so good but also not so bad) due to the \n\nfact that even in the wilderness the trails are prepared with dry toilets for outdoor \n\npeople, so there were sites with the minimum points (1 point) and maximum as well (10 \n\npoints), being a big part of the geosites with 2.5 points. In this way two geosites had 1 \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\npoint meaning that the geosites have toilets more than 5 km; ten with 2.5 points, toilets \n\nless than 5 km; four geosites with 5 points, toilets less than 1 km from the geosites; four \n\ngeosites with 7.5 points, toilets less than 200 metres from the geosite; four geosites with \n\n10 points, toilets on the geosite. The average here is 4.87 points or 0.24 points in 0.5 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: \n\n Even though the average of this sub-criterion was not so high, it is not a must to \n\nimprove it since in the wilderness far from the cities and villages there are always dry \n\ntoilets for people when hiking, canoeing, etc. One thing which could justify the creation \n\nof more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the number of visitors doing \n\noutdoor activities increases in a considerable number.  \n\n \n\nC.3. Restaurants (5%) \n\n The sub-criterion here was not good, being the maximum points 5 and only for \n\ntwo geosites and the rest under this value. In this way there were seven geosites with 0 \n\npoints, meaning there is no restaurants less than 20 km; two geosites with 1 point, being \n\nthe nearest restaurants between 5 km and 20 km but opening seasonally; seven geosites \n\nwith 2 points, being the nearest restaurant between 5 km and 20 km open all year round; \n\ntwo geosites with 3 points, having a restaurant between 1 km and 5 km opening \n\nseasonally; four geosites with 4 points, having a restaurant between 1 km and 5 km \n\nopening all year round; finally two geosites with 5 points (only a caf\u00e9 in the geosite or \n\nless than 1 km from the geosite and it opens seasonally), the two geosites with 5 points \n\nare: 17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi and 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s. The sub-\n\ncriterion had so few points that makes the average here quite low, having only 2 points \n\nor 0.1 points in 0.5 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: \n\n This was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the \n\ntrails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and of course it \n\nwould be very expensive to create a restaurant in the geosites which are far. Also here \n\nonly when the geopark starts to work and there is a justification for that it could be \n\nchanged something, for example opening a caf\u00e9 or restaurant all year round instead of \n\nshorter time or the construction of a new one. \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nC.4. Accommodation (5%) \n\n In the accommodation the results were not so good but better than in C.3. In this \n\nway there are seven geosites with the minimum points (1 point), meaning there is a hut \n\nfor hikers in the hiking trail or in the geosite; one geosite with 4 points, many types of \n\naccommodation less than 20 km and it opens seasonally; twelve geosites with 5 points \n\nhaving many types of accommodation less than 20 km; and finally, four geosites with 7 \n\npoints having many types of accommodation less than 5 km. Having in total of 4.12 \n\npoints or 0.2 points in 0.5 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: \n\n Here, like it happened in the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the moment, \n\nmaybe in the future if it justifies. \n\n \n\nC.5. Local buses (5%) \n\n As the public local buses are quite few and working only couple hours per day, \n\nthis sub-criterion was low ranked having ten geosites with 0 points, geosite more than \n\n20 km from the bus stop for a local bus; six geosites with 2 points, geosite between 10 \n\nkm and 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus; one geosite with 4 points, between 5 \n\nkm and 10 km from a bus stop for a local bus; four geosites with 6 points, geosite \n\nbetween 1 km and 5 km from a bus stop for a local bus; one with 8 points, geosite less \n\nthan 1 km from the bus stop for a local bus; finally, two reached the maximum points \n\n(10 points), there is a bus stop in the geosite (less than 300 metres): 17. Karhunpes\u00e4kivi \n\nand 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s. This sub-criterion received an \n\naverage of 2.83 points or 0.14 points in 0.5 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: \n\n Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment only in the \n\nfuture if it justifies, the other options is to rent a car or go by taxi. \n\n \n\nD. Perceptiveness (5%) \n\nD.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) \n\n This sub-criterion was the most subjective (based on the opinion of one viewer) \n\nand according to the viewer\u00b4s point of view the results here were not so satisfactory \n\nbeing only a geosite with 10 points and mostly of them with 4 points, fortunately none \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\nof them had 0 points. In this way three geosites had 1 point, being a geosite without any \n\nkind of beauty; eleven with 4 points, being a pleasant geosite, without any outstanding \n\nbeauty; two with 5 points, pleasant geosite, with some moderately attractive elements \n\n(small dimension); four geosites with 7 points being a pleasant geosite, with attractive \n\nelements, with visual impact; three with 8 points being very attractive geosite, with a \n\nstrong visual impact; and only one geosite reached 10 points, being all the elements of \n\nthe geosite extremely attractive, with a huge visual impact: 15. Tor formations at Pyh\u00e4-\n\nNattanen. This sub-criterion had an average of 4.95 points or 0.12 points in 0.25 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: \n\n As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the person\u00b4s opinion when is \n\nlooking to the geosite, it can\u00b4t be changed and since there is no geosite with negative \n\nimpact (rubbish spread all over the place) this sub-criterion will have the same results as \n\nbefore. \n\n \n\nD.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) \n\n In this one, twenty three geosites had the maximum points, all the geological \n\nelements are presented in a very clear way and understandable for all types of public, \n\nonly one geosite had 5 points, the visitor need to have some geological background to \n\nunderstand the geological element(s) of the geosite: 1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock \n\noutcrops. This sub-criterion had a successfully 9.79 points average or 0.24 in 0.25 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion D.2.: \n\n? 1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops: was the only geosite \n\nreceiving 5 points instead of 10 points due to the fact that is a little bit \n\ndifficult to understand its features but with a good geological explanation \n\nit can reach the 10 points easily, making in this way an average of 9.79 or \n\n0.24 points to 10 points or 0.25 points in this sub-criterion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\n \n\nTouristic Value Assessment of the Gold Historical Sites \n\n In all four criteria the one which had better average was B. Use with 7.12; next \n\nD. Perceptiveness with 7.1; A. Availability with 6.05 and finally C. Logistics with 4.1 \n\npoints. When the four main criteria have different weights is possible to observe the A. \n\nAvailability had 3.67 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.74 points in a total of 1 point; C. \n\nLogistics 1.01 in 2.5 points and finally in the criterion D. Perceptiveness 0.35 points in \n\n0.5 points. \n\n \n\nA. Availability (60%) \n\nA.1. Seasonal Occupancy (20%) \n\n In the seasonal occupancy the average was the same as in the geosites, being 6.6 \n\npoints or 1.32 in 2 points.  In this way seventeen sites were open two seasons (5 points) \n\nand eight all year round (10 points), none of them being open one season (2.5 points) or \n\nthree (7.5 points).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.1.: \n\n? 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: could be open all year round, so \n\ninstead of 5 points it could have 10 points.  \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to know if the ones with 5 points could be open all year round \n\nbecause the costs to maintain them and the safety can be factors to keep them closed. If \n\nthis gold historical site above mentioned could be open all year round the points will not \n\nchange so much but this sub-criterion could have 6.8 points or 1.36 points in 2 points. \n\n \n\nA.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) \n\n In this sub-criterion the results were not satisfactory, with an average of 3.72 or \n\n0.09 points, being lower than in the geosites. The gold historical sites are between 1 \n\npoint and maximum 7 points, none reaching more than this, this happens due to the fact \n\nthat many gold historical sites are in the wilderness having the visitor to walk to see \n\nthem. In this way there is three gold historical sites with 1 point, 2. Ruikanmutka; 7. \n\nR?takosk?\u2019s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine being the access to \n\nthese sites very difficult only possible with special equipment like for example a boat or \n\ncanoe; twelve gold historical sites with 3 points being the access possible and located \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nmore than 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road; three with 4 points, being the \n\nhistorical site located between 2 km and 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road; \n\none gold historical site with 5 points, being the site located between 1 km and 2 km \n\nfrom a paved road or a forest vehicle road; five sites with 6 points, being the site \n\nbetween 500 metres and 1 km from a paved road or a forest vehicle road and finally the \n\nonly site reaching 7 points, located between 200 and 500 metres from a paved road or \n\nforest vehicle road, site number 16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.2.: \n\n? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge because it is very difficult \n\nand dangerous to cross the river to see this site, having instead of 1 point, \n\n3 points. \n\n? 7. Ritakoski\u2019s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine: \n\nthe construction of a bridge near these two sites since the nearest bridge \n\nto cross the river stays quite far (about 10 km), having both in this way \n\ninstead of 1 point, 2 points each. \n\n \n\nThe distances to reach the gold historical sites can\u00b4t be changed, only the \n\nnumber 2, 7 and 8 were changed due to its difficult access. In this way the average \n\ndidn\u00b4t increase so much having  3.96 points or 0.099 in 0.25 points. \n\n \n\nA.3. Availability according to people\u00b4s physical conditions when the activity is hiking \n\nor walking (2.5%) \n\n This sub-criterion didn\u00b4t had so much difference from the geosites, being here \n\nthe average of 6.28 points or 0.15 in 0.25 points while in the geosites it was 6.87 or 0.17 \n\npoints. This is related with the long distances to reach the gold historical sites, like it \n\nhappened with the geosites. In this way there are two sites with 1 point, being the site \n\nvery difficult to reach only possible for people with excellent physical conditions; \n\nfifteen with 5 points, being the site with moderate difficulty at least for people with \n\ngood physical conditions; and finally eight sites reached the maximum points (10 \n\npoints), being those sites very easy, even for children, in these sites the distances are \n\nquite short and the paths are in good conditions.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.3.: \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\nHere nothing was changed because it depends mostly on the person\u00b4s physical \n\nconditions, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child can manage \n\nsome small distances, and mostly of the paths are in good conditions only having in \n\nsome of them (mostly on the shores of Ivalojoki River) some ups and downs, rocky \n\nparts and very steep areas which requires from the person a good physical preparation \n\nand good outdoor gear.  \n\n \n\nA.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) \n\n In twenty five gold historical sites, seventeen had the option of boat and/or \n\ncanoe being here the average of 4.6 or 0.16 points in 0.25. There were four sites with 1 \n\npoint, being the site more than 4 km from a boat and/or canoe; two with 3 points, site \n\nbetween 2 and 4 km from a boat and/or canoe; one with 5 points, site between 1 km and \n\n2 km from a boat and/or canoe; and finally, ten had 10 points being very close to a boat \n\nand/or canoe (less than 50 metres).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.: \n\n Also in this sub-criterion nothing could be changed relatively to the distances \n\nbetween the gold historical sites and the boat and/or canoe place. \n\n \n\nA.5. Visibility (2.5%) \n\n In this sub-criterion the average was very good being 9.24 points or 0.23 in 0.25 \n\npoints, better than in the geosites. Here, only a site had 5 points having the need to go \n\ncloser to see better all the historical elements and the rest of them with 9 and 10 points. \n\nThe ones which received 9 points are fourteen, the visibility to all historical elements is \n\nexcellent; with 10 points are ten, the visibility of the gold historical site is good to all or \n\nthe most important historical elements even with snow and darkness.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.: \n\n? 2. Ruikanmutka: cleaning the vegetation around the buildings, in this \n\nway could have 9 points instead of 5.  \n\n \n\nIn the rest of the sites nothing was changed since they are good ranked and if \n\nthey are not so perfectly visible in winter time is not a problem at all, in this way the \n\naverage could slightly rise from 9.24 or 0.23 points to 9.4 or 0.23 in 0.25 points. \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nA.6. Safety - in case of an accident (15%) \n\n In the safety in case of an accident the results were very bad, only with 2.96 or \n\n0.44 in 1.5 points, being even lower than in the geosites. This low results are related \n\nwith the fact that many of the gold historical sites are in the wilderness far from \n\nhospitals and without cellphone coverage. None of the sites had 0 points (site \n\nimpossible to visit due to the high danger on it); starting with thirteen sites with 1 point \n\n(site without any safety facilities, no mobile phone coverage and located more than 50 \n\nkm from the nearest hospital); one with 2 points (no safety facilities, more than 50 km \n\nfrom the nearest hospital but with mobile phone coverage); four with 3 points (with \n\nsafety facilities but more than 50 km from the nearest hospital and no mobile phone \n\ncoverage); one with 5 points (with safety facilities, mobile phone coverage but located \n\nmore than 50 km from the nearest hospital); and finally, six sites reached 7 points (site \n\nwith no safety facilities but with mobile phone coverage and located less than 50 km \n\nfrom the nearest hospital).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: \n\n? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the \n\nriver, having in this way instead of 1 point, 3 points. \n\n? 7. Ritakoski\u2019s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine:  \n\nthe construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, having in this \n\nway instead of 1 point, 3 points each site. \n\n \n\nThe rest of the gold historical sites nothing much could be done since the mobile \n\nphone coverage and the distances from the nearest hospital are quite difficult to change \n\nand the gold historical sites which don\u00b4t have safety facilities don\u00b4t make them \n\ndangerous, actually mostly of the paths are quite well preserved and taking care of. If \n\nthe gold historical sites above mentioned could be improved, the average could change \n\nslightly having 3.2 points or 0.48 in 1.5 points. \n\n \n\nA.7. Safety in the gold historical site and its access (15%) \n\n The results were really good being the average of 8.4 points or 1.26 in 1.5 \n\npoints, slightly lower than in the geosites. In this way, only one gold historical site had 2 \n\npoints (high danger in the access to the site): 2. Ruikanmutka, very dangerous to cross \n\nthe river; five with 6 points (moderate danger in the access to the site); the rest of the \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nsites had good points having twelve 9 points (safe access only with a little precaution \n\nand safe site) and seven 10 points (safe access and site). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: \n\n? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, \n\nhaving in this way instead of 2 points, 9 points. \n\n? 7. Ritakoski\u2019s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine: the  \n\nconstruction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, having in this way instead \n\nof 9 points, 10 points each.  \n\n? 18. The old cabin at Suomunruoktu: as this cabin is in the wilderness, \n\norientation skills are required to find this site, in this way it will be better for the \n\nsafety of the hikers to have a well-marked path, having this gold historical site \n\ninstead of 6 points, 9 points. \n\n? 23. Pihlajam\u00e4ki: in the area where this gold historical site is located is quite \n\ncommon to have thick fog making quite difficult to see something, so it will be \n\nimportant to mark quite well the trail with poles closer to each other showing the \n\nway. This will make instead of 6 points, 9 points.  \n\n? 24. Karhu Korhonen\u2019s Library: having poles closer to each other to sign the \npath because is quite common fog and bad weather in this area, having in this \n\nway instead of 6 points, 9 points. \n\n \n\nIf this actions above mentioned could be practiced the average will rise from 8.4 \n\npoints or 1.26 points to 9.12 points or 1.36 points in 1.5 points.  \n\n \n\nB. Use (10%) \n\nB.1. Signage (2%) \n\n The results here were quite spread, having some sites low points and others high \n\npoints making in this way an average of 4.8 or 0.096 in 0.2 points, more than in the \n\ngeosites. As the gold history in this region is very rich, some of the gold historical sites \n\nhave good signage, the only thing missing in all of them are signs showing that they are \n\ngold historical sites from the geopark. In this way there are six gold historical sites with \n\n0 points (no signs in the access road to the site neither in the site); one with 2.5 points \n\n(signs only in the access road); seven with 5 points (signs only near the site or in the \n\nplace); eleven sites with 7.5 points (signs on the main road access and in the site \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nshowing it is a touristic place, historical site or geological site); and none reaching the \n\n10 points. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: \n\n? All the gold historical sites need signs in the access roads and in the site saying \n\nis a gold historical site from the Golden Geopark. As there is only a main road \n\nthat links to secondary ones it is important to put in the main road (E75) and in \n\nthe roads that leads to these sites the signs. Related with the trails, mostly of \n\nthem have a board information at their starting point where it is necessary to \n\nmention the historical sites. In this way the average will be 10 points or 0.2 in \n\n0.2 points. \n\n \n\nB.2. The current use of the gold historical site in terms of historical interest (2%) \n\n Until now this was the best sub-criterion from the gold historical sites and from \n\nthe geosites, with all the sites having 10 points, making in this way the average of 10 \n\npoints or 0.2 points in 0.2 points due to the fact that all gold historical sites are \n\nrepresented in a museum, the International Gold Museum of Tankavaara.  \n\n \n\nB.3. The current use of the gold historical site for other interests (2%) \n\n The results here were not good, with 4.6 or 0.09 points in 0.2 points, a little bit \n\nlower than in the geosites. Mostly of the sites (nineteen sites) had 3 and 5 points and \n\nonly three reached the 10 points. In this way there is one site with 0 points (site without \n\nother type of interest, promotion and/ or use); one site with 1 point (site with other types \n\nof interest but without promotion and/ or use); nine with 3 points (site integrated in a \n\nnon-circular walking trail and ski trail or non-circular trail, walking or ski trail, and non-\n\ncircular boat/canoe route); ten sites with 5 points (site integrated in a circular walking \n\ntrail or sky trail or site integrated in circular boat/canoe route); one with 7 points (site \n\nwith a circular walking trail and ski trail or circular trail, walking or ski trail, and \n\ncircular boat/canoe route) and three with 10 points (site with other type of interest(s), \n\nwith promotion and use). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: \n\n? 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: on the path that leads to this memorial there \n\nis some remains of the Lapland War like old bombs, mines, grenades that could \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nbe better preserved and with some structure like showcases in the trail instead of \n\nbeing on the floor and getting damage like it happens right now (Figure 4.4.). In \n\nthis way not only gold history will be held but also a little bit of Lapland War \n\nhistory, having this sub-criterion instead of 1 point, 10 points.  \n\n \n\nRelated with the other gold historical sites, is not a must to change them since \n\nthey are already integrated for example in hiking trails, ski trails, canoe routes. The \n\naverage can rise  a little bit from 4.6 or 0.092 points to 4.96 or 0.099 points if the site \n\nabove could be improved.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4. Bombs, grenades, mines from the Lapland War left on the path. \n\n \n\n \n\nB.4. Use limitations of the gold historical site (4%) \n\n In this sub-criterion the average of the sites was very good, having 9.1 points or \n\n0.36 in 0.4 points, a little bit less than in the geosites. The majority of the sites (twenty \n\nsites) had 10 points (site without any restrictions); three with 7.5 points (site with \n\nphysical restrictions like fences, obstacles, etc.) and two with 2.5 points (site with \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\nrestrictions like opening hours, private property, etc.), none of them having 0 points \n\n(without any possibility to visit the site).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: \n\n Here nothing needs to be changed since the average is very good and all gold \n\nhistorical sites can be visited even if they have restrictions.  \n\n  \n\nC. Logistics (25%) \n\nC.1. Cleanliness (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion has a good average of 7.9 points or 0.39 points in 0.5 points, a \n\nlittle bit more than in the geosites. Being none of the gold historical sites with 0 points \n\n(site without any cleanliness, full of rubbish spread all over the place) and 2.5 points \n\n(site not so clean but with rubbish bins), being the minimum points 5 for three sites \n\n(clean site but without rubbish bins); fifteen with 7.5 points (clean site without rubbish \n\nbins but located less than 5 km from the site) and seven with 10 points (clean site with \n\nrubbish bins).   \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: \n\nLike it happened in the geosites, this sub-criterion doesn\u00b4t need changes, of \n\ncourse to reach the 10 points it could be arrange in every sinlge gold historical site a \n\nrubbish bin but as all the sites are clean even when they don\u00b4t have a rubbish bin, it is \n\nnot a must to change this sub-criterion.  \n\n \n\nC.2. Toilets (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion had not so bad results, having an average of 6.54 points or \n\n0.32 points in 0.5 points, higher than in the geosites. There is only one site with the \n\nminimum points (1 point) having the toilets more than 5 km from the site; eight with 2.5 \n\npoints, toilets less than 5 km from the site; three with 5 points, toilets less than 1 km \n\nfrom the site; one with 7.5 points, toilets less than 200 metres from the site; and twelve \n\nwith 10 points, toilets in the site.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: \n\nIn this sub-criterion is not a must to improve it since there is always dry toilets in \n\nmostly of the trails for people when hiking, canoeing, etc. One thing which could justify \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\nthe creation of more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the amount of \n\nvisitors doing outdoor activities increases in a considerable number. \n\n \n\nC.3. Restaurants (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion had very bad average, only reaching 1.28 points or 0.06 in 0.5 \n\npoints, worse than in the geosites. As many gold historical sites are in the wilderness the \n\nrestaurants are quite far from the sites, in this way seventeen gold historical sites have 0 \n\npoints (there is no restaurants less than 20 km from the site); two with 2 points \n\n(restaurant between 5 km and 20 km); five with 4 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 \n\nkm from the site); one with 8 points (restaurant less than 1 km from the site); and none \n\nreached the 10 points (restaurant in the site, less than 300 metres). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: \n\n This was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the \n\ntrails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and it would be very \n\nexpensive to create a restaurant in such a remote areas. Also here only when the geopark \n\nstarts to work it could be changed something, for example opening a caf\u00e9 or restaurant \n\nall year round instead of shorter time or a construction of a new one if it justifies. \n\n \n\nC.4. Accommodation (5%) \n\n Here the results were lower than in the geosites, being the average of the gold \n\nhistorical sites for accommodation only 2.8 points or 0.14 points in 0.5, being seventeen \n\nsites with 1 point (there is a hut for hikers in the hiking trail and/or in the site); three \n\nwith 5 points (many types of accommodation less than 20 km); four with 7 points (many \n\ntypes of accommodation less than 5 km) and only one with 10 points (many types of \n\naccommodation less than 1 km).   \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: \n\n Here, like it happened with the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the \n\nmoment, maybe in the future if it justifies. \n\n \n\nC.5. Local buses (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion had very low average due to the same thing that happened in \n\nthe geosites, few buses working in a very short time and long distances from the sites. \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\nIn this way this sub-criterion had 2 points or 0.1 points in 0.5 points, a little bit lower \n\nthan in the geosites. None of the gold historical sites reached the 10 points (bus stop in \n\nthe site, less than 300 metres); seventeen had 0 points (site more than 20 km from a \n\nlocal bus stop); one with 2 points (site between 10 km and 20 km from the bus stop for a \n\nlocal bus); four with 6 points (site between 1 km and 5 km from a local bus stop); and \n\nfinally, three sites with 8 points (site less than 1 km from the bus stop for a local bus).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: \n\n Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment, only in the \n\nfuture if it justifies, the other options is to rent a car or go by taxi.  \n\n \n\nD. Perceptiveness (5%) \n\nD.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) \n\n In the aesthetics, the gold historical sites had 4.2 points of average or 0.1 in 0.25 \n\npoints, a little bit lower than in the geosites. Here there was no site with 10 points being \n\nthe highest points 7 and the majority of the sites were between 4 and 5 points. In this \n\nway there is three sites with 1 point (site without any kind of beauty); ten sites with 4 \n\npoints (pleasant site, without any outstanding beauty); ten sites with 5 points (pleasant \n\ngold historical site, with some moderately attractive elements \u2013 small dimension); and \n\nfinally two with 7 points (pleasant site, with attractive elements, with visual impact). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the gold historical to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: \n\n As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the viewer\u00b4s point of view when \n\nis looking to the gold historical sites, it won\u00b4t be changed and since there are no gold \n\nhistorical sites with negative impact (rubbish spread all over the place, for example) this \n\nsub-criterion will have the same average as before. \n\n \n\nD.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) \n\n As there is a museum (Tankavaara Gold Museum), publications, among other \n\nmaterials explaining the gold historical sites, it is easy to general public understands in a \n\nvery clear way all gold historical sites, having in this way the average of 10 points or \n\n0.25 in 0.25 points. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\nTouristic Value Assessment of the Other Sites \n\nHere the highest sub-criterion was D. Perceptiveness with 8.37 points; after that \n\nA. Availability with 7.61; B. Use with 7.35 and C. Logistics with 5.54 points. When the \n\nfour main criteria have different weights is possible to observe the A. Availability had \n\n4.52 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.71 points in a total of 1 point; C. Logistics 1.36 \n\npoints in a total of 2.5 points and finally the criterion D. Perceptiveness 0.41 points in a \n\ntotal of 0.5 points.  \n\n \n\n \n\nA. Availability (60%) \n\nA.1. Seasonal occupancy (20%) \n\n The average for this sub-criterion was 8.43 points or 1.68 points in 2 points, \n\nbetter than in the gold historical sites and the geosites. Being only two sites with 5 \n\npoints (open two seasons); one with 7.5 points (open three seasons) and the rest of the \n\nfive with 10 points (open all year round).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.1.: \n\n? 2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site: it could be open all year round, having \n\nin this way instead of 5 points, 10 points. \n\n? 4. Ruijanpolku: it could be open all year round, having in this way instead of 5 \n\npoints, 10 points. \n\n \n\nIn this way the average will rise from 8.43 points or 1.68 points to 9.68 or 1.93 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\nA.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) \n\n In the terrestrial accessibility the results were not so satisfactory, having an \n\naverage of 4.25 or 0.1 in 0.25 points, not so different from the geosites and the gold \n\nhistorical sites. None of the sites had 0 points but the results were quite spread, three \n\nwith 1 point (the access to the site is very difficult, only possible with special \n\nequipment: boat, canoe, etc.); one with 3 points (the access to the site is possible and it \n\nis located more than 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road); one with 4 points \n\n(site located between 2 km and 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road); one with \n\n6 points (site located between 500 metres and 1 km from a paved road or forest vehicle \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nroad); one with 8 points (site located between 50 metres and 200 metres from a paved \n\nroad or forest vehicle road); and one with 10 points (site located less than 50 metres \n\nfrom a paved road or forest vehicle road with a parking area for a bus).   \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.2.: \n\nThe accessibility is quite good and the sites which had 1 point have already \n\ntransportation like boats from local enterprises, the rest of the sites the distances can\u00b4t \n\nbe changed. \n\n \n\nA.3. Availability according with people\u00b4s physical conditions when the activity is \n\nhiking or walking (2.5) \n\n Here the average was quite good having 8.12 points or 0.2 in 0.25 points, better \n\nthan in the geosites and the gold historical sites. None of the sites had 1 point (very \n\ndifficult to reach the site, only for people with excellent physical conditions); starting \n\nwith 5 points one site (moderate difficulty, at least good physical conditions); four with \n\n7.5 points (easy even for people with no great physical conditions) and three with 10 \n\npoints (very easy, even for children).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.3.: \n\nHere nothing was changed because it depends mostly on the person\u00b4s good \n\nphysical conditions or not, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child \n\ncan manage some small distances, and the trails are in good conditions and mostly of \n\nthem without big difficulties. \n\n \n\nA.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) \n\n  Here in eight sites, five had canoe and/or boat access being four with the \n\nmaximum points, 10 points (site located less than 50 metres from a boat and/or canoe) \n\nand one with 5 points (site located between 1 km and 2 km from a boat and/or canoe) \n\nhaving an average of 9 points or 0.22 in 0.25 points, better average than in the geosites \n\nand gold historical sites.  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.: \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n Nothing will be changed since this sub-criterion had very good average and also \n\nit is quite difficult to change the distances between the sites and the boat and/or canoe \n\nplaces. \n\n \n\nA.5. Visibility (2.5%) \n\n In the visibility the average was very good having 9.5 points or 0.23 in 0.25 \n\npoints, being similar with the geosites and gold historical sites. Here none of the sites \n\nhad 0 or less than 9 points, being four sites with 9 points (the visibility is excellent to all \n\ngeological/historical elements) and four reached the 10 points (good visibility to all or \n\nthe most important historical/ geological elements even with darkness and snow).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.: \n\n Since the visibility results were quite satisfactory, changes in this sub-criterion \n\nwere not necessary. \n\n \n\nA.6. Safety (15%) \n\n The average here was a little bit better than in the geosites and the gold historical \n\nsites, having an average of 4.37 points or 0.65 in 1.5 points and none of the sites had 0 \n\npoints neither reached the 10 points. In this way the sites with less points were two with \n\n2 points (site with no safety facilities and more than 50 km from the nearest hospital but \n\nwith mobile phone coverage); one with 3 points (site with safety facilities - fences, \n\nstairs, handrails, etc.- but no mobile phone coverage and located more than 50 km from \n\nthe nearest hospital); four with 5 points (site with safety facilities - fences, stairs, \n\nhandrails, etc. -, mobile phone coverage but located more than 50 km from the nearest \n\nhospital)  and one with 8 points (site with safety facilities, with mobile phone coverage \n\nand located less than 50 km from the nearest hospital).   \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: \n\n Here nothing needs to be changed even when the sites don\u00b4t have safety facilities \n\nbecause they are not dangerous. Related with the distances from the hospital and mobile \n\nphone coverage, these factors are quite difficult to change. \n\n \n\nA.7. Safety in the other site and its access (15%) \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n In this sub-criterion the results were better than in the geosites and the gold \n\nhistorical sites, having an average of 9.62 points or 1.44 in 1.5 points. Here none of the \n\nsites had 0 points or less than 8, starting from 8 points one site (safe site \u2013 only with a \n\nlittle precaution- and safe access); one with 9 points (safe access \u2013 only with a little \n\nprecaution- and safe site) and six sites with 10 points (site and access without any \n\ndanger for the visitor). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: \n\n Another sub-criterion where nothing needs to be done. The site which received 8 \n\npoints, 1. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave, visitors should be careful to not fall in the rocks \n\nwhen entering in the cave but is still quite safe, and the site which received 9 points, 4. \n\nRuijanpolku, is a safe hiking trail well singed and with some support structures for \n\nhikers but is always important when hiking to pay attention to the surrounding \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nB. Use (10%) \n\nB.1. Signage (2%) \n\n Here the average was higher than in the geosites and the gold historical sites, \n\nhaving in this way 6.87 points or 0.13 in 0.2 points. None of the sites had 0 points or \n\n2.5, starting with two sites with 5 points (signs only near to the site or in the site) and \n\nsix with 7.5 points (sings on the main road access and in the site showing it is a touristic \n\nplace, historical place or geological site). \n\n  \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: \n\n? All must have sings s?ow?n? \u201cot??r s?t?s\u201d from t?? Gol??n Geopark. Since there \n\nis only a main road that links to secondary ones it is important to put in the main \n\nroad (E75) and in the roads that leads to these sites signs showing is \u201cother site\u201d \n\nfrom the Golden Geopark. Related with the trails, mostly of them have a board \n\ninformation at their starting point being also important to mention the other sites \n\non these information boards. \n\n \n\nIn this way the average could rise from 6.87 or 0.13 points to 10 points or 0.2 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\nB.2. The current use of the other site in terms of geological/historical interest (2%) \n\nHere the average was very good with 9.68 points or 0.19 points in 0.2 points, \n\nbetter than in the geosites but lower than in the gold historical sites. None of the sites \n\nhad 0 or 2.5 points (site without any type of promotion or site with promotion only in \n\ninternet); being only one site with 7.5 points (promotion in internet and books, leaflets, \n\nmaps or in information board), and seven with the maximum points (interpretative \n\ncentre explaining the site).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.2.: \n\n? 1. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave: having a small interpretative centre for \n\nexample in Tankavaara Visitor Centre or in the mineral exhibition from \n\nTankavaara International Gold Museum or other partner with a space to do an \n\nexhibition could rise the points of this site from 7.5 to 10, but as there is already \n\na board information in this site and all information centres know this place is not \n\na must to create something more. \n\n \n\nThis sub-criterion could have instead of 9.68 or 0.19 points, the maximum points \n\n10 or 0.2 points. \n\n \n\nB.3. The current use of the other site for other types of interests (2%) \n\n This sub-criterion didn\u00b4t had so much high average being only 6 points or 0.12 \n\nin 0.2 points but still better than in the geosites and in the gold historical sites. The \n\nresults vary between two sites with 3 points (site integrated in a non-circular walking \n\ntrail and ski trail or non-circular trail, walking or ski trail, and non-circular boat/canoe \n\nroute); three with 5 points (site integrated in a circular walking trail or sky trail or site \n\nintegrated in circular boat/canoe route); one with 7 points (site with a circular walking \n\ntrail and ski trail or circular trail, walking or ski trail, and circular boat/canoe route) and \n\nfinally two with 10 points (site with other type of interest(s), with promotion and/ or \n\nuse). Fortunately, none had 0 or 1 points (site without any kind of interest, promotion \n\nand/or use or site with other types of interest without promotion and/ or use).   \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: \n\nAs mostly of the sites have some kind of hiking trail, ski trail or canoe route \n\neven if they are not all circular routes it is not a must to do alterations in the sites. \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nB.4. Use limitations of the other site (4%) \n\n In this sub-criterion the average was lower than in the geosites and in the gold \n\nhistorical sites, with 6.87 or 0.27 in 0.4 points. None of the sites had 0 points (site \n\nimpossible to be visited); starting with three sites with 2.5 points (site with restrictions \n\nlike private property, opening hours, etc.); one with 7.5 points (physical restrictions like \n\nfences, obstacles, etc.) and four with 10 points (without any restrictions).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: \n\nHere nothing needs be changed since all the sites can be visited. \n\n \n\nC. Logistics (25%) \n\nC.1. Cleanliness (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion had an average of 8.43 or 0.42 in 0.5 points, higher than in the \n\ngeosites and in the gold historical sites. There was no sites with cleaning problems (0 or \n\n2.5 points) being all the sites clean but with some differences between them, one \n\nreceived 5 points being clean but without rubbish bins; three with 7.5 points being clean \n\nand with a rubbish bin less than 5 km from the site, and four with 10 points, clean site \n\nwith rubbish bins. \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: \n\nLike it happened in the geosites and gold historical sites, here is not necessary to \n\ndo alterations, of course to reach the 10 points it could be placed in every single site a \n\nrubbish bin but as all sites are clean even when they don\u00b4t have a rubbish bin, it is not a \n\nmust to do changes in this sub-criterion.  \n\n \n\nC.2. Toilets (5%) \n\n Here the average was 7.93 points or 0.39 in 0.5 points, better than in the geosites \n\nand gold historical sites. Having here one site with 1 point (site located more than 5 km \n\nfrom a toilet); one with 2.5 points (site located less than 5 km from a toilet); none of the \n\nsites had 5 points (toilets less than 1 km from the site) or 7.5 points (toilets less than 200 \n\nmetres from the site), and being the rest of the sites (six) with 10 points (toilets in the \n\nsite).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\nIn this sub-criterion is not a must to improve since there is always dry toilets in \n\nmostly of the trails for people when hiking, canoeing, etc., one thing which could justify \n\nthe creation of more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the number of \n\nvisitors doing outdoor activities increases considerably.  \n\n \n\nC.3. Restaurants (5%) \n\n In this sub-criterion the average was quite low, with 2.75 points or 0.13 in 0.5 \n\npoints but still a little bit better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. None of the \n\nsites reached the 10 or 9 points (restaurant less than 300 metres from the site and open \n\nseasonally or all year round); being one site with 8 points (restaurant less than 1 km \n\nfrom the site); one site with 4 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 km); two sites with \n\n3 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 km and it opens seasonally); two sites with 2 \n\npoints (restaurant between 5 km and 20 km) and two sites with 0 points (no restaurants \n\nless than 20 km from the site).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: \n\nThis was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the \n\ntrails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and of course it \n\nwould be very expensive to build a restaurant in such a remote area. Also here only \n\nwhen the geopark starts to work it could be changed something, for example opening a \n\ncaf\u00e9 or restaurant all year round instead of shorter time or a construction of a new one if \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nC.4. Accommodation (5%) \n\n The average here was not so much satisfactory having only 4.87 points or 0.24 \n\nin 0.5 points, still a little bit better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. Here is \n\npossible to observe two sites with 1 point (there is a hut for hikers in the trail or in the \n\nsite); four sites with 5 points  (many types of accommodation less than 20 km); one with \n\n7 points (many types of accommodation less than 5 km) and one with 10 points (many \n\ntypes of accommodation less than 1 km).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: \n\n Here, like it happened with the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the \n\nmoment, maybe in the future if necessary. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nC.5. Local buses (5%) \n\n This sub-criterion had also very low average, only with 3.75 points or 0.18 in 0.5 \n\npoints but the results were better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. Being \n\nthree sites with 0 points (site more than 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus); one \n\nwith 2 points (site located between 10 km and 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus); \n\none with 4 points (site between 5 km and 10 km from a local bus stop); one with 6 \n\npoints (site between 1 km and 5 km from the bus stop); one with 8 points (site less than \n\n1 km from a bus stop) and one with 10 points (site with a bus stop \u2013 less than 300 \n\nmetres).  \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: \n\n Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment, only in the \n\nfuture if necessary, the other options is renting a car or go by taxi.  \n\n \n\nD. Perceptiveness (5%) \n\nD.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) \n\n The results here were better than in the geosites and gold historical sites, with an \n\naverage of 6.75 points or 0.16 points in 0.25 points, having three sites 5 points  \n\n(pleasant site, with some moderately attractive elements -small dimension); two 7 points \n\n(pleasant site, with attractive elements, with visual impact); two 8 points (very attractive \n\nsite, with a strong visual impact); and one 9 points (site extremely attractive, with a \n\nstrong visual impact); none reaching the maximum points (10 points). \n\n \n\nPriority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: \n\n As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the person\u00b4s opinion when is \n\nlooking to the sites,  it will not be changed and since there is no sites with negative \n\nimpact (rubbish spread all over the place) this sub-criterion will have the same average \n\nas before. \n\n \n\nD.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) \n\n This one had an average of 10 points or 0.25 in 0.25 points, the same as in the \n\ngold historical sites only being the geosites with lower results, this means that all the \n\ngeological or historical elements are understandable to all types of public.   \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nTable 4. 1.

Degradation Risk  \n \n\nDegradation Risk of the Geosites  \n\n \n\nA. Legal Protection (20%) \n\nMostly of the geosites are located in an area with legal protection but no control \n\nof access, having here twenty geosites with 5 points and the rest of the sites had 10 \n\npoints (sites in an area with no legal protection and without control of access). The \n\naverage here is not so low but also not so high, having 5.83 or 1.16 points in 2 points. \n\n \n\nB. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas \n\nnear, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)): \n\nThe average here was quite low having only 0.79 points or 0.15 in 2 points, this \n\nhappens because in the area of the geopark there is only gold panning made by \n\nenthusiasts but nothing related with big industrial mining. In this way, ten geosites had \n\n0 points (geosite located more than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or \n\nsmall scale degrading area/activity like for example gold prospecting); nine with 1 point \n\n(geosite located between 1 km and 5 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for \n\nexample gold digging); and finally five geosites with 2 points (geosite located between \n\n50 metres and 1 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for example gold \n\ndigging); none having more than this.  \n\n  \n\nC. Deterioration of geological elements (35%) \n\n Here were the best results (0 points) being all geosites safe, without danger of \n\ndeterioration. Of course in a future it is important to create a geoconservation plan to \n\nmanage these geosites but fortunately the scenario is not an emergency.  \n\n \n\nD. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) \n\n Here none of the geosites was close to a bigger city (more than 15000 \n\ninhabitants) or a bigger village (smaller than 15000 and bigger than 5000 inhabitants), \n\nbeing only three geosites less than 5 km from a village with couple hundred inhabitants \n\nor a touristic place (5 points); eight more than 5 km from a city, village or touristic \n\nplace (2.5 points); and finally, thirteen in the wilderness (0 points). This makes this \n\ncriterion with 1.45 points or 0.145 points in 1 point. \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nE. Accessibility (15%) \n\nE.1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) \n\n Here mostly of the geosites, twenty one, were located more than 100 metres \n\nfrom a forest vehicle road or geosite located more than 500 metres from a paved road (1 \n\npoint); two with 5 points, located less than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or \n\ngeosite located between 100-500 metres from a paved road; and only one with 10 \n\npoints, located less than 100 metres from a paved road with bus parking area (18. \n\nHummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s). The average here is very low having 1.70 \n\nor 0.12 points in 1 point. \n\n \n\nE.2. Boat and/or canoe access (7.5%) \n\n In twenty four geosites, ten have boat and/or canoe access being four geosites \n\nwith 10 points (located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or canoe place); one with 7 \n\npoints (located  between 100-500 metres from a boat and/or canoe place); one with 5 \n\npoints (located between 500 metres -1 km from a boat and/or canoe place); and finally, \n\nfour with 1 point (located more than 1 km from a boat and/or canoe place). Having here \n\nan average of 5.6 points or 0.42 points in 0.75 points.  \n\n \n\nThe nature conservation and protection in Finland is very effective and strict \n\nresulting in a very impressive variety of protected areas. Furthermore, the population in \n\nthis far north is quite sparse with some villages and no big cities, and all geosites are in \n\nquite good conditions making in this way an easier task to conserve the geosites. Of \n\ncourse it will be important in the future to create a specific plan to manage all the \n\ngeosites since there is not yet one developed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nDegradation Risk of the Gold Historical Sites \n\n \n\nA. Legal Protection (20%) \n\n In terms of legal protection there is nineteen gold historical sites with 5 points \n\n(located in an area with legal protection but no control of access) and six with 10 points \n\n(located in an area with no legal protection and no control of access), none being locate \n\nin an area with legal protection and control of access or in an area without legal \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\nprotection but with control of access, making the average of 6.2 points or 1.24 in 2 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\nB. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas \n\nnear, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)) \n\n In the area of the geopark there is only gold panning made by enthusiasts but \n\nnothing related with big industrial mining activities, in this way none of the gold \n\nhistorical sites had more than 2 points. Having 2 points nineteen gold historical sites \n\n(site located between 50 metres and 1 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for \n\nexample gold prospecting); five 1 point (located between 1 km and 5 km from a small \n\nscale degrading area/activity, for example gold prospecting); and one 0 points (located \n\nmore than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or small scale degrading \n\narea/activity, for example gold prospecting). In this way the average here is very low, \n\nwith 1.72 points or 0.34 points in 2 points. \n\n \n\nC. Deterioration of the historical elements (35%) \n\n Unfortunately here there were gold historical sites with 10 points, three sites \n\n(deteriorated/in ruins already); five with 9 points (site already deteriorated/in ruins but \n\nwith some small actions of protection and conservation); one with 8 points (possibility \n\nof deterioration of the main historical elements); two with 7 points (small possibility of \n\ndeterioration of the main historical elements); and fourteen with 0 points (any danger of \n\ndeterioration). Having in this way 3.88 of average or 1.35 points in 3.5 points.  \n\n \n\nD. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) \n\nHere none of the gold historical sites was close to a bigger city (more than 15000 \n\ninhabitants) or a bigger village (smaller than 15 000 inhabitants and bigger than 5000 \n\ninhabitants), being only six sites less than 5 km from a small village with couple \n\nhundred inhabitants or a touristic place (5 points); one site more than 5 km from a city, \n\nvillage or touristic place (2.5 points); and finally, eighteen in the wilderness (0 points). \n\nHaving a good average here with 1.875 or 0.14 points in 1 point.  \n\n \n\nE. Accessibility (15%) \n\nE.1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n In this sub-criterion only one site had 5 points (located less than 100 metres from \n\na forest vehicle road or located between 100-500 metres from a paved road, gold \n\nhistorical site n\u00ba 16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft) and the rest of them with 1 point (located \n\nmore than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or located more than 500 metres from a \n\npaved road), having this sub-criterion 1.16 of average or 0.087 in 0.75 points. \n\n \n\nE.2. Boat and/or canoe accessibility (7.5%) \n\n In twenty five gold historical sites, seventeen had boat and/or canoe access, \n\nbeing ten sites with 10 points (sites located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or \n\ncanoe place) and seven with 1 point  (gold historical sites located more than 1km from a \n\nboat and/or canoe place), being the average of 6.29 or 0.47 points in 0.75. \n\n \n\n Even though mostly of the gold historical sites are in an area with  legal \n\nprotection (like it happens with the geosites), they are in remote areas and mostly of \n\nthem are made of wood \u2013 material which gets bad with time. The critical cases are for \n\nexample the sites 12. The Kerkel\u00e4 mining village; 13. The Laanila white quartz rock and \n\nshaft; 14. The Kuivakuru pann?n? fac?l?ty; 15. G?n?ral\u2019s m?n? s?aft an? 16. Carl Gustaf \n\nmine shaft (all belong to Laanila Gold Trail), those sites have board information and \n\nfences to protect the ruins (Figure 4.5.) still they are open (exposed to weathering that \n\nmakes them degrading faster) and made of wood, in this way it could be implemented a \n\nmore effective method to protect the ruins, like for example some kind of glass structure \n\nto cover the sites and people still could see them. The other gold historical sites which \n\nare in bad shape (already in ruins) because it is difficult to reach them and take care of \n\nall, the best scenario would be the restoration of all or, the other solution, the creation of \n\nsome replicas but since this is a difficult task, the best option could be the continuation \n\nof the restoration and preservation works of some sites. The ones which are already in \n\nruins and nothing can be done, a memorial on the place where they were could be a \n\ngood idea. The International Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara does research and \n\nmapping of the old gold fields and with the collaboration of National Heritage Services \n\n(Mets\u00e4hallitus) creates volunteer camps to restore some historical buildings, it could be \n\ndeveloped more camps and including now the younger generations like for example \n\nstudents and scouts to create consciousness and awareness about these sites. \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Wood from the shaft exposed to the weathering in the Gold Trail of Laanila. \n\n \n\nOther Sites Degradation Risk \n\n \n\nA. Legal Protection (20%) \n\n Here, mostly of the sites were in an area with legal protection but no control of \n\naccess (five sites with 5 points); two with 7.5 points (being in a rea with no legal \n\nprotection but with control of access); and one with 1 point (having control of access as \n\nwell as being in an area with legal protection); none of them being in an area with no \n\nlegal protection and no control of access (10 points). Having in this way an average of \n\n5.12 or 1.02 in 2 points. \n\n \n\nB. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas \n\nnear, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)) \n\n In this criterion the results were very good being seven sites with 0 points \n\n(located more than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or small scale \n\ndegrading area/activity, for example gold prospecting) and only one with 1 point (site \n\nlocated between 1 km and 5 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for example \n\ngold digging); having this criterion a very low average of 0.12 points or 0.024 in 2 \n\npoints. \n\n \n\nC. Deterioration of geological/historical elements (35%) \n\n Also here the average was very good having only 0.87 points or 0.3 points in 3.5 \n\npoints, being seven sites with 0 points (with no danger of deterioration) and only one, 1. \n\nThe Korkia-Maura Ice Cave, with 7 points (having a small possibility of deterioration of \n\nthe main geological elements).  \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nD. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) \n\n Here none of the sites had more than 2.5 points, having 2.5 points five sites \n\n(more than 5 km from a city, village or touristic place); and three with 0 points (site in \n\nthe wilderness), reaching in this way an average of 1.56 points or 0.156 points in 1 \n\npoint.  \n\n \n\nE. Accessibility (15%) \n\nE. 1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) \n\n The accessibility was quite good having only an average of 1.5 or 0.11 points in \n\n0.75 points, being seven sites with 1 point (located more than 100 metres from a forest \n\nvehicle road or site located more than 500 metres from a paved road) and one with 5 \n\npoints (located less than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or located between 100-\n\n500 metres from a paved road).  \n\n \n\nE.2. Boat and/or canoe access (7.5%) \n\n In eight sites, five have canoe and/or boat access being four sites with 10 points \n\n(located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or canoe place) and only one with 1 point \n\n(located more than 1km from a boat and/or canoe place), being the average here quite \n\nhigh with 8.2 or 0.61 in 0.75 points. \n\n \n\n Here mostly of the sites are in an area with legal protection and the degradation \n\nrisk is very low. The most problematic site is the number 3. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave \n\nsince its permafrost started to thaw in summer time due to the visits of tourists to this \n\ncave, even if the only way to go to this site is by boat which controls a little bit the \n\nnumber of visitors, maybe in the future it will be necessary to have a more strict \n\nentrance in the cave (for example: only one time per week with a little amount of people \n\nvisiting or visitation only two times per month). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\n4.2. Interpretative contents for visitors (leaflets, panels, trails)  \n \n\n? H\u00e4rk\u00e4sel\u00e4n Kultala \u2013 Gem and Mineral Exhibition of Tankavaara \nInternational Gold Prospector Museum \n\nThe Gem and Mineral Exhibition is a separate building from the museum which \n\nis going to hold an improved exhibition. There are three floors, the first one is not going \n\nbe renovated due to the good quality of the exhibition but the last two are going to be \n\nrebuilt next summer (2017). Some ideas from the museum are being developed and \n\nothers in this work (next it will be presented both, ideas from the museum and from this \n\nwork): the second floor will hold some stones from Lapland with a very small \n\nexplanation of each one and a simple geological time scale that tells the geological \n\nhistory of Finland, maybe this geological time scale could be done by  students from a \n\nlocal school. The third floor will be presented with some history of geology where it is \n\nplanned to show some cases of the most notorious Finnish geologists as well as other \n\nprominent scientists in this area. Also in a different building from this museum or even \n\nin the interpretative centre of Tankavaara could be developed the explanation of each \n\ngeosite of the Golden Geopark.  \n\n \n\n? S\u00e1mi Museum and Northern Lapland Nature Centre Siida \n\nAs this museum has a permanent and temporary exhibition, in the temporary one \n\ncould be developed diferent types of exhibitions in different times of the year with \n\nsubjects like geoparks, geoconservation, geotourism, among others related with those \n\nsubjects. It could have also a temporary exhibition for a photograph competition  for the \n\ngeosites, gold historical sites and other sites, and the best photos receive a prize. \n\n \n? Information boards: \n\nRelated with the information boards in the Golden Geopark of Lapland, it could \n\nbe used only in the geosites (mostly because the gold historical sites and the other sites \n\nhave more information boards) nearer the road (less than 2 km from the road) like for \n\nexample 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkak\u00f6ng\u00e4s; 19. The Rahaj\u00e4rvi collapsed \n\ncliff, among others. In the most remote geosites no information boards at all because the \n\ncreation for each geosite an information board takes the feeling of being in such a \n\nremote area (in the wilderness) and of course the costs to maintain them are higher than \n\nthe ones nearer the road.   \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n? Books \n\nIt could be developed a practical book with a map to take to the \n\nhiking/canoeing/boat trip. The visitors could buy or borrow these materials from an \n\ninformation centre (partner of the geopark) or from the nearest point of the trail like an \n\naccommodation place, restaurant, etc. The book and the map should have three levels \n\nfor three different types of public (level 1, 2 and 3 - like it happens with some materials \n\nof the Basque Coast Geopark where they develop information for different types of \n\npublic): the first level is a very basic map and book for children and people who wants \n\nsimple information, the second level is more difficult for children to understand and \n\nadults have to have a certain interest for the subject and the third level is for adults who \n\nknows at least a little bit more geology than the rest of the general public, being this last \n\nlevel the information more detailed. The books and maps should be made from a \n\nmaterial very resistant to water and practical to open and read. \n\n \n? Downloaded information \n\nAs many sites are in the wilderness and there is no internet connection at all, one \n\nthing that could be developed is for example information to be downloaded for the \n\ncellphone before starting a trail. This could be created to Lemmenjoki area and Ivalojoki \n\narea too, where information about geosites, gold historical sites, other sites and other \n\nhelpful content are presented. People should be aware that there is no electricity in the \n\ntrails, so saving the battery of the cellphone is something important.  \n\n \n? Hiking trails, ski trails and canoe routes \n\nThe area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland is an excellent place for nature \n\nlovers providing good hiking trails, ski trails, canoe routes (many well-marked and \n\nothers not marked for people with more experience and orientation skills); trails for \n\ndifferent types of public (adventure people, families, among many others) all with day \n\nhuts and overnight huts, fireplaces and dry toilets, having this area many ways to see the \n\ngeosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites. Some details need to be improved \n\nin the trails, like for example in the Lemmenjoki trail and the Pahaoja \u2013 Kultala \n\nGold Mining Village trail, at the beggining of both there is an information board (Figure \n\n4.6.) for hikers about the rules, the infrastructures (huts, firepalces, dry toilets, among \n\nothers) and a map showing everything in the area, for a better map should be mention \n\nthe geosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites of the area as well as the canoe \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\nand ski routes. Some parts of these trails should be better signed and it is necessary to \n\ncreate in some areas new trails (already explained in 4.1.1.Touristic value assessment).  \n\nFinishing the ideas about the trails, the trails in the area of the geopark don\u00b4t \n\nneed to have a specific theme (e.g.: one trail talks about the ice age; other about the \n\nGreenstone belt), instead of this one trail can be used for different types of themes (e.g.: \n\nin one trail is possible to talk about the Ice Age, the Greenstone Belt, The Era of \n\nWeathering, among others). Some geosites are far from the road so there is no \n\ninformation boards making in this way more flexible to explain different types of \n\nthemes, if it has a board information is not a problem because is still possible to connect \n\nto other subjects. \n\n \n\n  \n(a) \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 4.6. Lemmenjoki map (a) and Pahaoja \u2013 Kultala Gold Mining Village map (b). \n\n \n\nRelated with the canoe and boat routes, there should be signs like an high pole \n\nwith a distinctive color that is not similar with the colors of the surrounding nature on \n\nthe river banks to show the geosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites for \n\ncanoeists and people with a boat.  \n\n \n\n? Other interpretative materials and activities \n\nIn the geological trail of Tankavaara there is an information board at the \n\nbeginning of the trail about the geological features of the area as well as six boxes under \n\nit that are made for play a game (Figure 4.7). In this game, inside of those boxes are \n\nsome leaves, stones, wood sticks among other natural materials and people have to try \n\nwith their hands to guess what it is inside of each box. This game could be changed a \n\nlittle bit to geological purposes, like for example guessing by taking a stone away from \n\na box which stone it is and after that check the information about the stone which is \n\ninside of each box, other idea could be a game where outside of each box there is an \n\nimage (without a name) of  some geological features like an esker, gorge, hill, and so \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\non, and students should guess which image is by writing down in a paper the name \n\n(esker, gorge, hill, etc.) and put it inside of the box where they think is the right image \n\n(this game could be played with teachers). This system could be implemented in more \n\ntrails.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7. Begining of the Geological trail with a board information about the geology of the place and six boxes \n\nwith some stones, leaves, among other materials from nature. \n\n \n\n? Libraries \n\nPublications of the Golden Geopark (eg.: application, papers from symposiums, \n\nconferences and future works) could stay in the library of Ivalo village in a small corner. \n\nAlso the library car (a car that stops in each village and city to provide books for \n\npeople) could have a place with the geopark publications or at least people could order \n\nthem from this car. \n\n \n\n4.3. Definition of a geotourism strategy (web, marketing, publications, \nevents, etc.) \n \n \n\n? Promotion  \n\n The Golden Geopark should promote itself as an area in the wilderness where \n\npeople can explore the nature doing outdoor activities like hiking, canoeing, bicycling, \n\ngold prospecting, skiing, snowshoeing, among others, in a safe environment and with \n\nfacilities for all kinds of public (outdoor people, families, younger and older groups) \n\nwhere geology, gold history and indigenous people are the main theme of the geopark. \n\nAs the tourism in this area is quite seasonal, the geopark can help to promote Lapland \n\nall year round due to the creation of more activities and quality service. \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n? Website of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project \n \n Related with the website of the Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\n(http://goldengeopark.fi), some parts have to be improved. One of these parts is in the \n\ndescription of each geosite, gold historical site and other site and their accesses, where \n\nthere is a map of the access (Figure 4.8.), these maps should show better how to get to \n\nthe sites or at least a link to the Excursion maps (https://www.retkikartta.fi); other \n\ncrucial point is to show which sites are open or not all year round because in the website \n\nis not so well explained.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8.  Map on the Golden Geopark of Lapland website showing how to reach one of the sites. Some \n\nimprovements should be done.  \n\n \n\nOther small improvements should be done like for example in the introduction \n\nof the geopark. The website when speaks about the Golden Geopark of Lapland it just \n\nexplains the projects which aimed to establish the geopark in this area, informing which \n\nwere the responsible entities for the projects and its collaborators but it doesn\u00b4t say \n\nmore, the only place which clarifies more is a link for the application of the geopark. \n\nFor this reason, inside of the geopark website, it should have a little bit more of \n\nexplanation about the geopark (a brief description of which is the main goal of the \n\ngeopark, its philosophy, what is interesting to see in terms of geology, gold history and \n\nS\u00e1mi culture) not being only this information in the application form. Another idea, in \n\nthe future, that could be applied in the geopark website, is a link promoting the partners \n\nwith touristic activities (snowshoeing, snowmobile, ice-fishing, gold panning, etc.) and \n\nhttp://goldengeopark.fi/\nhttps://www.retkikartta.fi/\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nthe partners with accommodation. One other good idea in the future, used in the Basque \n\nCoast Geopark, is to create a calendar in the website of the geopark showing its \n\nactivities and people could book directly from the website. Also this website should be \n\npromoted in the touristic websites of the area as well as the activities of the geopark \n\n(eg.: inarisaariselka.fi).  \n\n \n\n? Touristic magazines, newspapers and other places \n\nThe geopark should promote itself in local touristic magazines and newspapers \n\nas well as its activities and events. Taking the idea from the Azores Geopark, where \n\nthey have in their regional newspaper a regular page published twice a month talking \n\nabout the geosites, other geoparks, promotion of the partners, events/actions made by \n\nthe geopark, etc., the Golden Geopark could also promote itself in regional newspapers \n\nand magazines with interesting subjects. With this newspapers and magazines create \n\ncompetitions, quizzes too, involving in this way more people in the subjects of the \n\ngeopark.  \n\nThe \u201ccapital\u201d of Lapland is Rovaniemi (outside of the area of the geopark), \n\nbeing the entrance to Lapland, this makes this place an important point for information, \n\nfor example put geopark information in the information centres of the city to promote \n\nthe geopark. \n\n \n\n? Works to be developed by students \n\nIt is a very important task for all geoparks to involve younger generations, for \n\nthis reason the Golden Geopark should promote works/activities with students. One \n\nexample that can be practiced is with the students of the University of Lapland in areas \n\nsuch as marketing, tourism, geology and environment. The activity/works can include \n\nwork groups under the supervision of professors from the university and the groups \n\ncould try to develop ideas, activities, strategies of nature conservation, marketing, \n\namong others in the area of the geopark. Also the development of summer camps or \n\nstudents exchange programs where students from other countries visit the Golden \n\nGeopark and develop some work related with the areas above mentioned it is an \n\ninteresting task. \n\n \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\n? For bus groups and individual visitors who do not want to do outdoor \n\nactivities  \n\nAs many geosites, gold historical sites and other sites are quite far from a road, \n\nrequiring in this way at least an hike, it should be developed some sites near the roads \n\nfor these kind of public to explain the geology of the area as well as the gold history and \n\nthe S\u00e1mi culture. The sites can be sites already existed in the geopark (near to the road, \n\nnot requiring big effort or long time to reach them) or new ones, like for example in \n\nKaunisp\u00e4\u00e4 view point (where it is possible to see a 360\u00ba view of the area), the Ukonj\u00e4rvi \n\nPanorama Caf\u00e9, the view point near Karhunpes\u00e4kivi, among other points where a bus \n\ncan stop and people don\u00b4t need to walk so much. Related with the gold historical sites \n\nand the other sites there is already museums, so the creation of points to see them is not \n\nso necessary as in the geosites. \n\n \n\n \n\n? Development of touristic packages for different groups \n\nThe Golden Geopark should create packages for different groups like for \n\nexample families, schools, bus groups, people who like nature, very adventurous people \n\nand for different times of the year (winter, spring, autumn and summer). It should \n\ninclude accommodation, restaurants, trails, other nature activities and a different \n\npackage for the most adventurous ones who like to spend the night in nature and like to \n\ndo long distances.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\nConclusions \n \n\n The work developed here had the 57 sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland \n\nproject assessed in terms of their touristic value as well as their degradation risk. For the \n\ntouristic value assessment this work was mainly based on the proposals by Pereira and \n\nPereira (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves (2013) and for the degradation risk an adaptation was \n\nmade from the proposal of Brilha (2016). The scientific value assessment was not \n\ndeveloped here but it is a very important item to take into consideration in the future \n\nbecause it may give a clearer idea of the value of the sites.  \n\n For the touristic value assessment and the degradation risk it was necessary to do \n\nfield work to check each geosite, gold historical site and other site. The field work took \n\nplace in October of 2015 and May, June and July of 2016 since in winter time is quite \n\ndifficult to check the sites. For the touristic value assessment it was defined four main \n\ncriteria and eighteen sub-criteria using two methodologies, percentage methodology and \n\npoints methodology, to compare the results. The results obtained were placed in \n\ndifferent categories (\u201cInsufficient\u201d, \u201cSufficient\u201d, \u201cGood\u201d, \u201cVery Good\u201d and \n\n\u201cExcellent\u201d). The geosites and the gold historical sites in both methodologies did not \n\nhave so good results being the other sites with better values. When analysing all of them \n\n(57 sites) the results were not so high but also not so low being 62.77% and 6.24 points. \n\nRelated with the degradation risk, the gold historical sites had higher values than the \n\ngeosites and the other sites. \n\n As the Golden Geopark of Lapland is at a beginning stage and still a project \n\n(failing to achieve the membership of the Geoparks Network in September 2015) more \n\nwork has to be developed. The Geopark is already in an area with a very strong link to \n\nthe tourism; great network of trails (marked ones and for the more adventurous and with \n\norientating skills not marked trails), canoe routes, bike routes, ski routes, among others; \n\nwith infrastructures to support people\u00b4s needs during the outdoor activities; good \n\ninterpretative centres and a network of hotels, restaurants and other infrastructures for \n\ntourists.  On the other hand, the long distances to reach the sites; the long distances to \n\nreach infrastructures like hotels, restaurants, hospitals, among others; the lack of \n\nrecognition of the geopark in the area (for example none of the sites had the logo of the \n\ngeopark and some were quite difficult to locate due to the lack of signs) are negative \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\npoints that can be changed during the time finding the right solutions, the work created \n\nhere can be a step for improving some of these gaps on the geopark. \n\n To conclude, the main goals of this work were achieved and it has the main \n\npurpose to help the geopark to improve. In this way, the geopark can implement and \n\ncreate actions of conservation, promotion and mostly the valorisation of the sites. With \n\nthe touristic improvement of the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites the \n\ngeopark can provide a quality product and different in Lapland, enriching the area, \n\nalways being the main goals the conservation and valorisation of the sites of the \n\ngeopark. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n \n\nBibliographic references \n\nBarbey, P. &amp; Raith, M.
