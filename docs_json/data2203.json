O VP tem formato el??ptico com maior e menor eixos medindo 330 e\n\n130 km, aproximadamente, intensificado em subsuperf??cie. O vo?rtice se estende verticalmente de\n\n100 a 400 metros, com velocidades ma?ximas de 0,6 m.s?1, recirculando cerca de 2 Sv das a?guas da\n\nSNB. Apesar da presenc?a do vo?rtice na termoclina, o fluxo em superf??cie e? para noroeste durante\n\ntodo o ano. A ana?lise da variabilidade da velocidade coletada em fundeio na Bacia Potiguar revela\n\ndois principais modos estat??sticos de variabilidade; um com maiores amplitudes na porc?a?o da co-\n\nluna da?gua correspondente ao VP, e um outro modo, que explica menor porcentagem da varia?ncia\n\nda se?rie de dados original, associado a processos ligados a? camada de superf??cie. O primeiro EOF\n\ne? associado a oscilac?o?es barocl??nicas com per??odos de 25 a 35 dias. Este sinal tambe?m e? identi-\n\nficado em altimetria no Atla?ntico. No?s caracterizamos esses sinais como expressa?o de ondas de\n\nRossby, e especulamos que o gatilho para a gerac?a?o das mesmas seria instabilidade barotro?pica\n\ngerada pelo cisalhamento de correntes no Atla?ntico Tropical.\n\nAdicionalmente, com o intuito de analisar o processos de gerac?a?o do VP, no?s desenvolve-\n\nmos modelos de feic?a?o da SBN e Corrente Profunda de Contorno Oeste (CCP), para serem usados\n\ncomo base para o deselvolvimento do campo inicial para simulac?o?es de modelagem nume?rica em\n\numa abordagem de estudo de processo dina?mico. Os Modelos de Feic?a?o, desenvolvidos a partir de\n\ndados de velocidade, com densidade e temperatura calculados a partir da relac?a?o do vento te?rmico\n\ne salinidade da climatologia WOA (2013), capturam os principais atributos das feic?o?es de inter-\n\nesse com sucesso, sendo adequados para a investigac?a?o das principais caracter??sticas do campo de\n\ncorrentes na Bacia Potiguar.\n\nDois nume?ricos experimentos foram realizados: (i) Somente SNB, com profundidade\n\nma?xima de 1500 m, e (ii) SNB + CCP, com profundidade ma?xima de 5500 m. O VP foi gerado em\n\nambos os experimentos, com velocidade ma?xima, profundidade do nu?cleo e tamanho consistentes\n\ncom observac?o?es sino?ticas. Assim, temos que o VP pode ser gerado em um campo de velocidades\n\ncontendo somente a SNB, e que o cisalhamento vertical induzido pela presenc?a da CCP parece ter\n\num papel importante nas caracter??sticas do mesmo (extensa?o vertical, velocidades ma?ximas, etc,\n\netc), uma vez que o VP teve um processo de formac?a?o diferente em cada experimento.\n\nPalavras Chave: Mesoescala, Vo?rtice, Subcorrente Norte do Brasil.\n\n\n\nxix\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this dissertation we describe a newly discovered subsurface frontal meander of the\n\nNorth Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC), centered at about 4 oS, 36.5 oW, hereafter Potiguar Eddy (PE).\n\nThe Potiguar Eddy is an elliptically-shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately\n\n330 and 130 km, with a subsurface signature. It extends vertically from 100 m to 400 m, with\n\nmaximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 and recirculates about 2 Sv of waters from the NBUC. Despite\n\nthe presence of the PE in subtermocline waters, the surface flow is northwestward throughout\n\nthe year. The analysis of variability of mooring velocity data in the Potiguar Bight revealed two\n\nmost important statistical modes of variability (EOFs); one with high amplitudes over most of the\n\nportion of the water column which corresponds to the PE, and another one, explaining a lower\n\npercentage of the variance, associated with upper-layer processes. The first EOF mode is found\n\nto be associated with baroclinic oscillations with periods of about 25-35 days. This signal is also\n\nseen in altimetric fields in the Atlantic Ocean. We characterize these signals as Rossby waves,\n\nand speculate that the trigger for their generation would be barotropic instability generated by the\n\ncurrent shear in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAditionally, with the intent of analyzing the generation process of the PE, we developed\n\nFeature Models of the NBUC and Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), to be used as basis\n\nfor developing the initial field for numerical model simulations in a dynamical process-study ap-\n\nproach. The Feature Models, developed from observed velocity data, with temperature calculated\n\nthrough the thermal wind equation, and salinity from WOA (2013) climatology, successfully cap-\n\nture the main attributes of the features of interest, and thus are suitable for the investigation of the\n\nmain characteristics of the flow in the Potiguar Bight.\n\nTwo numerical experiments were set up; (i) a NBUC-only experiment, with maximum\n\ndepth of 1500 m, and (ii) a NBUC-DWBC experiment, with a maximum depth of 5500 m. The\n\nPotiguar Eddy was formed in both experiments, with maximum velocity, core depth and size\n\nconsistent with synoptic observations. As a result, the PE can be generated by a velocity field con-\n\ntaining only the NBUC; and the DWBC - induced vertical shear seems to play a part on the eddy\u2019s\n\ncharacteristics (vertical extent, maximum velocities, etc), since the PE had different formation\n\nprocesses in the two experiments.\n\nKeywords: Mesoscale, Eddy, North Brazil Undercurrent.\n\n\n\nxx\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis dissertation analyzes the Potiguar Eddy, a subsurface anticyclone within\n\nthe North Brazil Undercurrent domain, on the northeast coast of South America. In the\n\nfollowing sections, we describe the main characteristics of the current field in the area,\n\nstressing the ones that might influence the Potiguar Eddy. In this Chapter we also state\n\nour goals and scientific hypothesis for the present work.\n\n1.1 Equatorial Current System\n\nThe South Equatorial Current (SEC) crosses the Atlantic Ocean zonally west-\n\nward, meridionally extending from about 20o S to 4o N (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI,\n\n2005). Because of its meridional extent, the SEC is divided into three branches by Moli-\n\nnari (1982) and four branches by Stramma and Schott (1999). Here, we will use the\n\ndivision proposed by the latter authors (Figure 1.1):\n\n\u2022 South South Equatorial Current (sSEC): The sSEC is the portion of the SEC\n\nwhich extends from about 8o S to 20o S, located south of the South Equatorial\n\nCounter Current (SECC) (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005).\n\n\u2022 Central South Equatorial Current (cSEC): The cSEC is the portion of the SEC\n\nlocated north of the SECC and south of the South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC),\n\ncentered at about 4o S, reaching 34\u00b15 cm.s?1 velocities at 30o W (LUMPKIN and\n\nGARZOLI, 2005) with a transport of about 29 Sv (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u2022 Equatorial South Equatorial Current (eSEC): The eSEC is the portion of the\n\nSEC located north of the SEUC and south of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC),\n\nbeing located along about 1-2o S (SCHOTT et al., 2003).\n\n\u2022 North South Equatorial Current (nSEC): The nSEC, the only branch of the SEC\n\nlocated on the northern hemisphere, flows north of the EUC and south of the North\n\nEquatorial Undercurrent (NEUC). Molinari (1982) does not distinguish between\n\neSEC and nSEC. The nSEC has velocities of about 33 \u00b1 11 cm.s?1 at 2o N (LUMP-\n\nKIN and GARZOLI, 2005).\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic map of the currents in the upper Western Equatorial Atlantic\n\nOcean. Solid lines represent surface-intensified currents, and dashed lines, subsurface\n\ncurrents. Shown are the South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC), central, equatorial and\n\nnorth branches of the South Equatorial Current (cSEC, eSEC and nSEC, respectively),\n\nSouth Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC), Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), North Equato-\n\nrial Undercurrent (NEUC), North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), and North Brazil\n\nCurrent (NBC). Based on Goes et al (2005), Stramma and Schott (1999) and Schott et al\n\n(1998).\n\nThe currents which separate the different branches of the SEC are mostly sub-\n\nsurface currents, and so the limits of most of the SEC branches are not always very clear\n\n\n\n3\n\nat the surface. The nSEC and cSEC become clearly distinguishable, in the mean, only\n\nat about 30o W, separated by an eastward velocity core of 6 \u00b1 12 cm.s?1 at 1o S. How-\n\never, this clear distinction does not happen with the other SEC branches. As a whole,\n\nthe highest westward velocities in the SEC are at the cSEC core, at 4o S, where they are\n\nabout 34\u00b15 cm.s?1 at 30o W, linearly decreasing to about 8 cm.s?1 at 8o S, remaining ap-\n\nproximately at this value until 20o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005). The distinction\n\nbetween cSEC and eSEC is also not clear at the surface.\n\nThe variability of the SEC system is driven by i) resonant response to semiannual\n\nvariations in equatorial wind forcing (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980), and ii)\n\nannual variations in South Atlantic wind stress. The second process is important because\n\nit connects the southern hemisphere subtropical gyre to the equatorial gyre through the\n\nNBC. Both processes influence on the strength of the SEC branches (LUMPKIN and\n\nGARZOLI, 2005).\n\nThe largest values of seasonal variations occur in the nSEC, which strenghtens\n\nin boreal fall (Sep/Oct/Nov) and reverses in boreal spring (Mar/Abr/May). According\n\nto Lumpkin and Garzoli (2005), this mode corresponds to the equilibrium response to\n\nthe annual variation of winds (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980). Lumpkin and\n\nGarzoli (2005) point that specifically in the western tropics, the wind stress curl reverses\n\nin boreal spring, which forces thermocline depth changes consistent with the reversing\n\nNECC (GARZOLI and KATZ, 1983) and nSEC (KATZ, 1981). The nSEC also has high\n\namplitudes of semiannual fluctuations (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), which are a\n\nresonant response to the semiannual component of equatorial wind forcing in the eastern\n\nAtlantic (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980). It is important to note that in the\n\nmean field, the nSEC feeds into the North Brazil Current (NBC) at 0-2o N, so its reversal\n\nduring boreal spring deprives the NBC of this input (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005).\n\n1.2 The Origins of the North Brazil Undercurrent\n\nThe sSEC reaches the Brazillian coast at approximately 10o S, according to Pe-\n\nterson and Stramma (1991), 12-20o S, according to Stramma and Schott (1999), and ap-\n\n\n\n4\n\nproximately 12-14o S, on the mean, according to Lumpkin and Garzoli (2005). With the\n\nEkman transport removed, these authors indicate that the sSEC bifurcates further south,\n\nat about 15-17o S. At this bifurcation, the sSEC divides into a southern branch, which is\n\ncalled the Brazil Current (BC), and a northern branch, called the North Brazil Undercur-\n\nrent (NBUC) (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).\n\nThe Rodrigues et al. (2007) numerical model results suggest that there is a\n\nseasonal variation of the position of the bifurcation, and that this variation is related to\n\nchanges in the local wind stress curl due to annual north-south excursion the the In-\n\ntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). More specifically, their results show that as the\n\nSEC bifurcation latitude moves south (north), the NBUC transport increases (decreases)\n\nand the BC transport decreases (increases). The southernmost position of the bifurca-\n\ntion latitude, in the first 200 m of the water column, is reached in July (? 17o S) and its\n\nnorthernmost location is reached in November (? 13o S).\n\nEven though the sSEC has surface expression, the Ekman drift in the region is\n\nsouthwestward, therefore the surface expression of the NBUC is weakened. The eastern\n\ncoast of Brazil then has a subsurface-intensified boundary current, with its core located at\n\napproximately at 100-200 m depth (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).\n\n1.3 NBUC Characterization\n\nAt 11o S, the core of the NBUC is found at 200 m depth, with a transport of 12.3\n\nSv between the isopicnals 24.5 kg.m?3 (? 70m) and 26.8 kg.m?3 (? 250 m) (GOES et\n\nal., 2005). The NBUC surface-layer transport at this latitude is less than 2.5 Sv - evidence\n\nof its subsurface nature. From the surface down to about 1000 m, Silveira et al. (1994)\n\nfound at 10.5o S a total transport of 23.7 Sv, with a 50 cm.s?1 core somewhat shallower, at\n\n150 m depth. The mean total NBUC transport at 11o S (from five realizations) is reported\n\nby Schott et al. (2005) as 25.4 \u00b1 7.4 Sv above 1100 m.\n\nFrom a 4-year-long transport time series at 11o S, Schott et al. (2005) found a\n\n2.5 Sv amplitude seasonal variation in the NBUC transport, with maximum northward\n\ntransport in July. This corroborates the numerical results of Rodrigues et al. (2007),\n\n\n\n5\n\nwho relate the NBUC maximum transport in July to the southernmost position of the\n\nsSEC bifurcation. Variability of the NBUC at 11oS was also investigated by Veleda et\n\nal. (2012), who describes intraseasonal variability with periods of two-three weeks in the\n\nalongshore velocity component measurements, consistent with Coastally Trapped Wave\n\ntheory.\n\nThere are no dramatic changes in the NBUC on its northward pathway. At about\n\n5o S, its core is still located at the subsurface, at about 100-150 m depth, with a transport\n\nof 19.9 Sv above 1000 m (SILVEIRA et al., 1994). At the same latitude, Schott et al.\n\n(2002) found a 25.0 \u00b1 4.4 Sv transport above 1100 m, with only 2.7 \u00b1 1.8 Sv between\n\nthe surface and the 24.5 isopicnal, and 13.4\u00b1 2.7 Sv between 24.5 and 26.8 isopycnals,\n\nwhich is the density range that feeds the EUC (SCHOTT et al., 1998). It is noteworthy\n\nthat Schott et al. (2002), from 5 realizations, did not find a seasonal signal at 5o S in the\n\nNBUC transport.\n\nThe water mass structure of the NBUC at 5o S is characterized by Tropical Water,\n\nSubtropical Underwater, South Atlantic Central Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water ,\n\nwith a transport of 26.5\u00b13.7 Sv above 1100 m (SCHOTT et al., 2005), from 9 sections. At\n\nthe same latitude, Goes et al. (2005) found a smaller (compared to their 11o S estimate)\n\ntransport, of 12.6 Sv, between the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 and ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopicnals.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that these authors calculated the NBUC transport down to the\n\n?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopicnal, which at this region is located approximately at 700 m depth.\n\nTherefore, their total transport for the NBUC is calculated in a smaller portion of the\n\nwater column than the calculations from other authors.\n\n1.4 The cSEC and its Influence on the NBUC\n\nAs the cSEC approaches the equator, it begins to influence the transport, velocity\n\nand core depth of the NBUC. Therefore, it becomes important to know the characteristics\n\nof the cSEC in order to understand the effects it will have on the NBUC.\n\nThe westward cSEC flows zonally along about 4o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI,\n\n2005) with a transport upper bound of 26 Sv according to Molinari (1982) and a 29 Sv\n\n\n\n6\n\ntransport indicated by Silveira et al. (1994) at the western part of the Atlantic, where it\n\nreaches the Brazillian coast. At 30o W, this surface-intensified current has 34\u00b15 cm.s?1\n\nvelocities, and is separated from the nSEC by a mean eastward speed of 6\u00b112 cm.s?1 at\n\n1o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), even though it must be noted that these authors\n\napparently do not differenciate the cSEC from the eSEC.\n\nAt 35o W, Schott et al. (1995) found in March, 1994 a combined cSEC and eSEC\n\ntransport of 18.6 Sv, with a surface core of 0.4 m.s?1 and a weaker subsurface core of 0.2\n\nm.s?1, extending from the surface to about 400 m depth. On the other hand, Schott et\n\nal. (2003) describe the mean (from 13 sections) transport associated with the cSEC and\n\neSEC as much smaller, of only 7 Sv between 4 and 2o S, and not clearly distinguishable\n\nfrom the NBC, which they consider to flow south of 4 o S. Even though there is not a\n\nclear distinction, the authors associate a 50 cm.s?1 surface core identified at 35o W to the\n\ncSEC. It is noteworthy that in the study of Schott et al. (2003) the SEUC was connected\n\nto the EUC, therefore limiting the vertical extent of the eSEC and cSEC, thus reducing its\n\ntransport, which may be the cause for such a difference between the calculated transport\n\nfrom Schott et al. (2003) and from Schott et al. (1995). Both cSEC and eSEC extend\n\ndeeper than the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 isopicnal, as described by Goes et al. (2005) and Schott\n\net al. (2003), and since the eSEC is considered to be the flow north of the SEUC and the\n\ncSEC is defined as the flow south of SEUC, once the SEUC has no surface expression, the\n\ncombined mean flow is also over the SEUC, extending from about 2o S to 4o S (SCHOTT\n\net al., 2003) (Figure 1.2).\n\nMesoscale activity has been reported upon the arrival of the cSEC on the western\n\nboundary. Silveira et al. (1994) found that, in May-July 1986, this current bifurcates at\n\nabout 6-5o S into two branches at 31o W. One of them (with a transport of about 14 Sv)\n\nflows southwestward until 9.5o S and them makes a cyclonic turn and coalesces with the\n\nNBUC, already formed by the sSEC. The other branch of the cSEC (with a transport of\n\nabout 15 Sv) flows northwestward and coalesces with the NBUC north of 5o S, where the\n\nNBUC had already been originated by the sSEC and fed by the other branch of the cSEC.\n\nHowever, only Silveira et al. (1994) identified this bifurcation, suggesting that it might be\n\nseasonal/occasional. The superposition of the cSEC and NBUC cores was also reported\n\n\n\n7\n\nby, for example, Stramma et al. (1995), and the current originated by the superposition of\n\nthese two cores is then called North Brazil Current (NBC) (SCHOTT et al., 1998).\n\nFigure 1.2: Mean 35o W velocity section from Schott et al (2003) (from 13 sections).\n\nShown are the North Brazil Current (NBC), South Equatorial Current (SEC), South Equa-\n\ntorial Undercurrent (SEUC), South Intermediate Countercurrent (SICC), Equatorial Un-\n\ndercurrent (EUC), Equatorial intermediate Current (EIC), North Intermediate Counter-\n\ncurrent (NICC), upper, middle and lower North Atlantic Deep Water (uNADW, mNADW\n\nand lNADW, respectively), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Positive values indi-\n\ncate eastward flow.\n\n\n\n8\n\n1.5 The NBUC North of 5o S\n\nNorth of about 6-4o S, the NBUC receives contribution from the cSEC (SIL-\n\nVEIRA et al., 1994; LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), which greatly increases the\n\nNBUC transport, also being capable of originating a double-core current system. This\n\nkind of structure was observed, for example, in March 1994 at 35o W, by Schott et al.\n\n(1995), who found the NBUC/NBC system with a 0.6 m.s?1 core at about 150 m depth\n\nand a surface core of about 0.3 m.s?1. The total transport for the NBUC/NBC system\n\nin this realization was 26.2 Sv. Transport increase due to the superposition of the cSEC\n\nand NBUC cores is large not only at the surface layer: Goes et al. (2005), for instance,\n\nreported an increase from 12.6 Sv at 5o S to almost 17 Sv at 35o W within the ?0 = 24.5\n\n- 26.8 kg.m?3 layer, implying that the cSEC extends deeper than the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3\n\nisopicnal.\n\nIn the upper layer (surface-?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3) at 35o W, the boundary transport\n\nis also enhanced, increasing from less than 2.5 Sv to 12.3 Sv (GOES et al., 2005). This\n\nresults in a contribution of about 14 Sv between the surface and the ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3\n\nisopicnal by the cSEC. In the study of Schott et al. (2003), due to the cSEC contribu-\n\ntion, the NBC/NBUC system at 35o W transports 32.2 Sv above 1200 m depth. Sum-\n\nming the mean transport found by the same authors in the cSEC and eSEC (7 Sv) to the\n\nNBC/NBUC system transport, the mean northwestward transport at 35o W south of 2o S\n\nis 39.2 Sv above the ?1 = 32.15 kg.m?3 isopycnal, with a 60 cm.s?1 core at about 100 m\n\ndepth (SCHOTT et al., 2003).\n\n1.6 Dissertation Hypothesis\n\nAs mentioned on the previous sections, most of the information on the NBUC\n\nbefore its coalescence with the cSEC is found at approximately zonal sections at 11o S\n\nand 5o S. Information on the horizontal synoptic structure of the NBUC, as well as its\n\nvertical structure, is scarse between those latitudes - the only NBUC description between\n\n11o S and 5o S is by Silveira et al. (1994). In addition, the subsurface nature of the\n\ncurrent prevents altimetry-based studies of the NBUC in this area. Further downstream,\n\n\n\n9\n\non the region of superposition of the cSEC and NBUC cores, the information is even\n\nmore scarse. West of 35o W, the next section in which the NBUC was repeatedly studied\n\nwas 44o W, where the NBUC and cSEC are already merged and are, on the mean, not\n\ndistinguishable (SCHOTT et al., 1998). Between 35o W and 44o W the only study that\n\naddresses the horizontal structure of the NBUC is Goes et al. (2005).\n\nThis data scarcity leaves a knowledge gap on the three dimensional synoptic\n\nstructure and time variability of the NBUC on the region between 35o W and 44o W, i. e.,\n\nbetween the latitudes where the cSEC reaches the western boundary and where these two\n\ncurrents are already merged. In this context, in this dissertation we describe the Potiguar\n\nEddy (PE), a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy identified at the Potiguar Bight, centered at\n\nabout 36.5o W, 4o S. Considering the existence of this feature, we hypothesize that\n\nThe NBUC has important mesoscale activity in the Potiguar Bight region, and this activ-\n\nity, on the form of meandering, is associated with the interaction of the NBUC with the\n\ncontinental margin physiography and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC).\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we describe the Potiguar Eddy based on synoptic hydro-\n\ngraphic and current data, moored current data, and global numerical model simulation\n\nresults. Besides describing the eddy through observational data, we also characterize it\n\nthrough a process-oriented study approach, carrying out simulations with the Regional\n\nOcean Modeling System (ROMS).\n\n1.7 Objectives\n\nThis dissertation aims to characterize the mesoscale feature referred here as Po-\n\ntiguar Eddy as well as investigate its formation, maintenance, and recurrence processes.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we analyze hydrographic and current synoptic data, moored current\n\ndata, altimetry data, and global numerical model outputs. Furthermore, for a better un-\n\nderstanding of the feature, we turn to idealized numerical model simulations, using the\n\nprocess-study approach with the oceanic feature modeling technique.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSpecifically, the objectives of the dissertation research are:\n\n\u2022 to three-dimensionally characterize the PE based on hydrographic and vessel-\n\nmounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data;\n\n\u2022 to assess the dynamical regime of the PE based on in situ synoptic data;\n\n\u2022 to analyze moored current data and altimetry data in terms of the PE persis-\n\ntence/recurrence and its intraseasonal variability;\n\n\u2022 to understand the processes involved on the PE persistence/recurrence through\n\nlonger time scales (semiannual and annual variabilities) by way of an analysis on\n\nglobal numerical model outputs;\n\n\u2022 to address the importance of the vertical shear due to the interaction with the\n\nDWBC on the dynamics of the PE through idealized experiments, by applying a\n\nFeature Model technique in a primitive-equation numerical model.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we characterize synoptically the eddy and investigate its vertical\n\nstructure, based on data from two oceanographic cruises. In Chapter 3, the temporal\n\nvariability is analyzed, using moored and altimetry data, as well as model results. In\n\nChapter 4, we describe and analyze the results of numerical simulations carried out using\n\nthe process-study approach. The summary and conclusions are presented in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCharacterization of the Potiguar Eddy\n\nIn this chapter we characterize the PE based on synoptic data collected by two\n\noceanographic cruises. These observations are, together with the ones described by Goes\n\net al. (2005), the only data available to us on the region in which the NBUC subsurface\n\ncore and the cSEC surface core are superposed but still distinguishable. In this chapter we\n\nanalyze these observations using them as basis for investigating the spatial distribution of\n\nthe ocean currents and the mesoscale activity in the region.\n\n2.1 Data set\n\nTwo surveys of the PE region were carried out from RV Antares by the Brazil-\n\nian Navy, during February 26th - March 21st, 2002 (ONEI cruise) and October 26th-\n\nDecember 20th, 2004 (ONEII cruise). During both surveys, Conductivity-Temperature-\n\nDepth (CTD) data was acquired, as well as current data from a vessel-mounted Acoustic\n\nDoppler Current Profiler (VMADCP).\n\nThe VMADCP profiling of the near-surface layer was carried out by a 75 kHz\n\nRD-Instruments system. The ADCP was configured for 8 m - depth cells and its depth\n\nrange was about 450 m for ONEI and 300 m for ONEII, and the data were processed\n\nusing the Common Ocean Data Access System (CODAS) software. The sampling grid\n\ndiffered between cruises; 8 transects were sampled during ONEI and 13 during ONEII\n\n(Figure 2.1).\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\nFigure 2.1: Trajectory of the vessel while acquiring ADCP data and location of CTD\n\nstations during ONEI (February 26th - March 21st 2002, left panel) and ONEII (Octo-\n\nber 26th- December 20th 2004, right panel) cruises. Light gray areas indicate regions\n\nshallower than 60 m.\n\nFor these VMADCP sections, due to instrument noise, objective analysis was\n\nperformed on the velocity data, considering a correlation function of the form 2.1:\n\nC(x,z) = (1 ? ?2)e\n(\n?( xLx )\n\n2\n?( zLz )\n\n2\n)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ? is the data random error variance, and Lx and Lz are the correlation lengthscales\n\nin x (cross-shore) and z (vertical) directions, respectively (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).\n\nSpecifically for the case of the velocity sections, considering the anisotropy be-\n\ntween the vertical and the horizontal cross-shore axes, the possibility of choosing different\n\ncorrelation legthscales for different axes is crucial. Here we use values of 100 km and 50\n\nm on the x- and z-axis, respectively. The squared variance of the error considered is 0.02.\n\nWe also use objective analysis to perform extrapolation between the first velocity profile\n\nacquired and the coast, applying a no-slip boundary condition at the bottom.\n\nBesides the VMADCP data, hydrographic data were collected by a Sea Bird\n\nElectronics 9 plus CTD with a sampling frequency of 24 Hz, temperature accuracy es-\n\n\n\n13\n\ntimated at \u00b1 0.001 oC, and salinity accuracy, at \u00b1 0.001. During both cruises a series\n\nof CTD profiles were sampled at the locations indicated by the black dots in Figure 2.1.\n\nThe CTD data were processed using the Sea Bird Electronics software. Horizontal dis-\n\ntributions of temperature, salinity and potential density were obtained through objective\n\nmapping with an assumed isotropy of a correlation function of the same form as the one\n\npresented in Equation 2.1 with the y-coordinate substituting the z-coordinate.\n\nDue to the depth reach of the equipment, the water column below ? 300-450 m\n\nwas not sampled by the VMADCP. We then use the CTD data in order to estimate the\n\nvelocities in a larger portion of the water column, using the geostrophic aproximation.\n\nThe geostrophic aproximation assumes that the flow is steady, friction is neg-\n\nligible, vertical velocities are negligible (i. e., hydrostatic approximation), and the ratio\n\nbetween the advective and coriolis acceleration (i. e., the Rossby number) is much smaller\n\nthan one. These characteristics are typical of regions of open ocean, far from the surface\n\nand bottom boundary layers. This relation is mathematically expressed by Equation 2.2.\n\nu = ?\n1\n\nf\n\n???\n\n?y\n; v =\n\n1\n\nf\n\n???\n\n?x\n(2.2)\n\nwhere u is the cross-shore velocity; v is the alongshore velocity; f is the coriolis acceler-\n\nation; and ?? is the geopotential anomaly inferred from hydrographic data.\n\nConsidering the limitations of the geostrophic approximation, mainly that the\n\nRossby number should be smaller than one, and the proximity between the equator and\n\nthe study region, we make an assessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation\n\nfor this study through computations of the Rossby number from the observed data, prior\n\nto the computation of the geostrophic velocity sections. We also compare the calculated\n\ngeostrophic velocities and the VMADCP velocities.\n\nFor the computation of the geostrophic velocities, we follow Stramma (1991)\n\nand Stramma et al. (2005) level of no motion of ?1 = 32.15 kg.m?3. The resulting\n\ngeostrophic sections were then regridded using objective analysis (Equation 2.1), with\n\ncorrelation lengthscales on the x- and z-axes of 300 km and 70 m, respectively, and error\n\nsquared variance of 0.1. After regridding, the geostrophic velocities were extrapolated up\n\nto the coast and a no-slip boundary condition was enforced. For this procedure, 80 km\n\n\n\n14\n\nand 10 m lengthscales were used for the x- and z-axis, respectively. The velocity sections,\n\nobserved as well as geostrophic, allow the investigation of the vertical extent of the eddy.\n\nIn order to investigate the horizontal patterns of flow, the ADCP-derived stream-\n\nfunction distribution was calculated for all levels in which ADCP data was acquired. For\n\nthe mapping, we employ the so-called direct objective mapping, as described by Brether-\n\nton et al. (1976) and later successfully applied by Silveira et al. (2000) to the NBC\n\nretroflection region (5?-8?N). This technique uses the kinematic relationship between hor-\n\nizontal velocities and streamfunction to derive a correlation function for the latter quantity\n\nonce the correlation function of the former quantities are known from the observations.\n\nWe closely follow Silveira et al. (2000) by assuming an isotropic streamfunction correla-\n\ntion function with lengthscale of 125 km for both the x and y directions. The squared vari-\n\nance of the error considered was 0.2678. The streamfunction mapping reveals mesoscale\n\nspatial patterns that aid the interpretation of the information from the velocity sections.\n\n\n\n15\n\n2.2 Results\n\nWe start our analyses with the description of the horizontal distribution of the\n\nhydrographic variables collected during ONEI and ONEII cruises. Then we analyze the\n\nhorizontal ADCP-derived streamfunction distribution for both cruises, at the near-surface\n\nand at the depth of the highest PE velocities, i. e., ? 150 m. We then turn to the ADCP\n\nvelocity sections to aid our understanding of the circulation in the area, specifically the\n\nPotiguar Bight. Considering the limited ADCP depth reach, in order to have a better\n\nunderstanding of the circulation on a larger portion of the water column, we apply the\n\nClassical Dynamic Method to obtain geostrophic velocities from the surface down to\n\nabout 1500-1800 m. That is done after an assessment of the dynamical regime of the PE\n\nis made, to assure that the geostrophic aproximation is reasonable in the area.\n\nThe near-surface temperature distribution for ONEI as well as for ONEII cruise\n\n(Figures 2.2 and 2.3, left panels) does not show a clear pattern that can be associated with\n\nthe circulation in the area. During ONEI, the highest values of about 28.4 oC occur on the\n\nsouthern portion of the domain, around 8oS. During ONEII the near-surface water is not\n\nas warm as during ONEI, presenting maximum values of about 27.5 oC on the northern\n\nportion of the domain. At 144 m (Figures 2.2 and 2.3, right panels), the temperature\n\nfields present much greater gradients than at the near-surface. On both cruises, the highest\n\ntemperatures are found on the southern portion of the sampling grid, and a patch of higher\n\ntemperature values is seen along the coast on the NBUC domain, suggesting that these\n\nhigh temperature values are advected northward by the NBUC. The lowest temperature\n\nvalues are found, in both instances, on the northeastern portion of the domain. Also,\n\nduring ONEI the temperature at the near-surface layer is higher, and at the 144 m level\n\nit is lower than during ONEII. Therefore, the water column had stronger stratification\n\nduring ONEI (February-March).\n\nThe near-surface salinity fields for ONEI and ONEII (Figures 2.4 and 2.5, left\n\npanels) show the highest salinity values on the southern portion of the sampling grid, and a\n\npatch of relatively high salinity values along the coast, on the NBUC domain. The lowest\n\nsalinity values, on the other hand, are located, on both instances, on the north/northeastern\n\nportion of the sampling grid for each cruise. It is interesting to notice that the near-surface\n\n\n\n16\n\nsalinity distribution for ONEI shows much larger gradients than during ONEII. On 144\n\nm (Figures 2.4 and 2.5, right panels), the gradients do not differ as much between the\n\ncruises; the salinity values during ONEI and ONEII are approximately within the same\n\nrange. As at the near-surface, the higest values are located on the southern portion of the\n\nsampling grid as well as close to the coast, on the NBUC domain. The highest gradients\n\nare found on the offshore side of the NBUC, between 5oS and 10oS.\n\nFigure 2.2: Temperature and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m (right\n\npanel) during ONEI. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\nFigure 2.3: Temperature and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m (right\n\npanel) during ONEII. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\n\n\n17\n\nFigure 2.4: Salinity and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m (right\n\npanel) during ONEI. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\nFigure 2.5: Salinity and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m (right\n\npanel) during ONEII. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\n\n\n18\n\nThe potential density near-surface distribution (Figures 2.6 and 2.7, left panels)\n\nis quite different between the ONEI and ONEII cruises. During ONEI, larger gradients are\n\nfound, since the potential density presents a much wider range of values when compared\n\nto ONEII. In general, for both cruises the higher potential density values occured along\n\nthe coast and close to the southern portion of the domain, while the lowest values are\n\npresent on the northeastern portion of the sampling grid. At 144 m depth (Figures 2.6 and\n\n2.7, right panels), the distributions for both cruises are more alike; the lowest potential\n\ndensity values are located on the southern portion of the sampling grid and they follow\n\nthe path of the NBUC northward, as the sSEC low density waters are transported by the\n\nNBUC. The highest potential density values are located on the same area where the lower\n\ntemperature and salinity values occur, i. e., the northeast corner, around 5oS - 3oS.\n\nTherefore, from the hydrografic fields for both cruises, we can see that the sSEC\n\nsignature (high temperature, high salinity, low potential density) is transported northward\n\nalong the coast by the NBUC. Also, the subsurface nature of the NBUC caused these\n\nsignatures not to be very distinguishable, or not visible at all, at the near-surface. It is\n\nalso noteworthy that the Potiguar eddy, in spite of being present in the area, has a subtile\n\nsignature on the temperature, salinity of potential density fields relative to the NBUC but\n\ncontrasts importantly with the lower-density surface-intensified inpinging cSEC.\n\nFigure 2.6: Potential density and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m\n\n(right panel) during ONEI. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\n\n\n19\n\nFigure 2.7: Potential density and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m\n\n(right panel) during ONEII. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.\n\nAfter analyzing the hydrographic properties, we turn to the horizontal distribu-\n\ntions of the ADCP-derived streamfunction. The near-surface streamfunction distribution\n\nfor both cruises (Figures 2.8 and 2.9, left panels) depict the cSEC impinging on the north-\n\neastern tip of South America. The expression of the NBUC is either very weak or absent,\n\ndue to the subsurface nature of its core. Suggestions of a recirculation, especially on the\n\nnorthern part of the domain, which might be associated with the retroflection that origi-\n\nnates the EUC, are identified. Also, a cyclonic turn of the cSEC, in agreement with the\n\none observed on the study of Silveira et al. (1994), is seen during ONEI (Figure 2.8, left\n\npanel). Other than that, suggestions of a few weaker recirculations on the domain are\n\nidentified.\n\nAt ? 150 m (Figures 2.8 and 2.9, right panels), the streamfuncion distribution\n\nchanges dramatically. The path of the NBUC, following the coast of Brazil in its path\n\nnorthward, is clearly identified in both instances. Also, the PE, as an anticyclonic re-\n\ncirculation confined between the coast and the NBUC, is observed during ONEII, and\n\nsuggestions of its existence are seen on the distribution for the ONEI period. This ellipse-\n\nshaped eddy is centered at approximately 4o S, 36o 30\u2019 W, with major axis parallel to the\n\ncoast. We estimate from the streamfunction maps the minor and major axis of the PE\n\nto be 136 km and 330 km, respectively. To perform this calculation we considered the\n\n\n\n20\n\noutermost closed streamline, with a value of -4.104 m2s?1, as the limit of the eddy.\n\nFigure 2.8: ADCP-derived streamfunction distribution during ONEI (February - March\n\n2002) at 32 m ( ? surface, upper panel) and 144 m ( ? depth of the PE core, lower panel)\n\ndepth.\n\nFigure 2.9: ADCP-derived streamfunction distribution during ONEII (October - Decem-\n\nber 2004) at 32 m ( ? surface, upper panel) and 144 m ( ? depth of the PE core, lower\n\npanel) depth.\n\n\n\n21\n\n2.2.1 VMADCP Vertical Sections\n\nAfter analyzing the horizontal circulation patterns, we turn to ADCP-acquired\n\nvelocity sections in order to characterize three-dimensionally the flow on the study area.\n\nOn the velocity sections from ONEI (Figures 2.10-2.12), the NBUC is clearly identified,\n\nwith intense velocities of about 1.1 m.s?1 at the subsurface. The depth of the NBUC core\n\nvaries between 250 m on section 1 and 100 m on section 8, with a general tendency of\n\nshoaling on the downstream direction, as expected (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; SCHOTT et\n\nal., 1998). Even though the NBUC signature is very clear at the nearshore portion of the\n\nsections, the flow on the offshore portion does not present a clear pattern, specially for the\n\nsections 1-5 (Figures 2.10 -2.11). The flow on the eastern part of these sections is much\n\nweaker than on the western part, and there is no clear correspondence between the flow on\n\nthe eastern part of different sections. Section 2, in particular (Figure 2.10, middle panel),\n\nshows a structure that may be interpreted as an anticyclonic eddy, with a core beyond the\n\ndepth reach of the ADCP and similar velocity magnitudes in both positive and negative\n\nvelocity cores. It is likely, by the latitude of this feature, that it is part of a DWBC deep\n\neddy as described by Dengler et al. (2004). However, there is no sign of this structure on\n\nsections 1 or 3.\n\nFurther downstream, sections 6-8 (Figures 2.11 - 2.12) present a quite different\n\npattern from the previous sections. Sections 6 and 7, which show the NBUC going around\n\nthe Calcanhar Cape at the northeastern tip of Brazil, show a consistent 0.4 m.s?1 south-\n\neastward/eastward velocity core at the offshore part of the section, at 200-250 m depth,\n\nwhich corresponds to the subpycnocline retroflection of the NBUC to form the SEUC.\n\nSection 8 is a unique section in the sense that the NBUC is detached from the coast. This\n\nis the only ONEI section in which there is actually an eastward flow near the coast in-\n\nstead of westward. The NBUC then, located at about 120 km from the coast, spreads\n\nover a much larger horizontal area then on previous sections. Also, its core is consider-\n\nably closer to the surface than on previous sections, as well as stronger, with velocities of\n\nabout 1.3 m.s?1. The shoaling of the core and the intensification of the current are both\n\ndue to the presence, in this region, of the central branch of the South Equatorial Current.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the downstream strenghtening of the surface expression of the NBUC:\n\n\n\n22\n\non section 1 (Figure 2.10, top panel) the NBUC surface velocities are about 0.2 m.s?1\n\nin contrast to section 7, where the surface velocities reach about 1 m.s?1, decreasing to\n\nabout 0.6 m.s?1 on section 8.

As a consequence, inferences\n\nabout the NBUC vertical structure could not be made for the isopycnal interior of ?0 =\n\n24.5 - 26.8 kg.m?3. The NBUC during ONEII (Figures 2.13-2.17) has roughly the same\n\nstrength as during the ONEI cruise, with the core velocity ranging between 0.7 m.s?1 and\n\n1.2 m.s?1. As done for the sections from ONEI cruise, for ONEII cruise we will separate\n\nthe sections for analysis purposes.\n\nOver sections 1-5 (Figures 2.13 - 2.15), the NBUC is attached to the coast, with\n\nits core at aproximately 200 m depth, with similar magnitudes to the ones during ONEI\n\n(? 0.6 - 1 m.s?1). The eastern part of the sections presented velocities even weaker than\n\nthose during ONEI, and a flow pattern is not identifiable.\n\nFigure 2.14: ADCP velocity sections 3 (top panel) and 4 (bottom panel) from ONEII\n\ncruise (October - December 2004).

Shaded areas indicate regions where the percent good from the ADCP data\n\nwas lower than 50.\n\n\n\n28\n\nOn sections 6 and 7 (Figure 2.15), the NBUC has a stronger core than on previous\n\nsections, presenting velocities of about 1.1-1.2 m.s?1. This suggests that, since section\n\n6 is located at about 5o S, the contribution from the cSEC is responsible for the NBUC\n\nintensification. However, no significant change on the depth of the core can be identified;\n\non the other hand, the NBUC surface expression (0.4 m.s?1) becomes stronger when\n\ncompared to upstream sections (?0.2 m.s?1). On the eastern portion of the sections,\n\nthe east/southeastward core associated to the SEUC formation is observed, stronger (0.5\n\nm.s?1) on section 6. On both sections 6 and 7 this core is present at about 200 m depth.\n\nThe fact that the NBUC suffers dramatic changes as it passes Cape Calcanhar is\n\nnoticeable when comparing sections 8-10 (Figures 2.15 - 2.17) with upstream sections.\n\nSections 8-10 are on the domain of the Potiguar Eddy, therefore their main characteristic is\n\nthat the NBUC is detached from the coast and there is an eastward/southeastward velocity\n\ncore close to the continental slope, associated with the nearshore lobe of the Eddy. The\n\neastward flow observed has maximum velocities of about 0.4-0.6 m.s?1, at about 170 m\n\ndepth, with the exception of section 8, in which it has a second core that reaches the\n\nsurface. As mentioned, on these sections the NBUC is detached from the continental\n\nslope, being located at about 150 km from the coast on sections 8 and 9, and closer (?50\n\nkm) to the coast on section 10.\n\nFigure 2.16: ADCP velocity section 9 from ONEII cruise (October - December 2004).\n\nValues are in m.s?1.

Shaded areas indicate regions where the percent good from the\n\nADCP data was lower than 50.\n\n\n\n30\n\nOn sections 11-13 (Figures 2.17), the NBUC goes back to being attached to\n\nthe slope, but with a larger horizontal extent, reaching up to about 200 km from the\n\ncoast. Another noticeable change on the NBUC is the increasingly higher velocity at the\n\nsurface, which culminate on section 13 (approximately at 40o W) in which two cores are\n\nobserved: a subsurface one, associated to the NBUC, and a surface one, associated with\n\nthe cSEC and eSEC. This surface northwestward expression can reach about 0.8 m.s?1\n\non the portion closest to the coast. However, no significant change in depth is seen on\n\nthe subsurface core, which is still found at about 120-150 m depth. Table 2.1 presents the\n\ntransports for the NBUC and PE for all the transects.\n\n2.2.2 The Rossby and Burger Numbers\n\nEven though the streamfunction maps and the velocity sections help us charac-\n\nterize the NBUC, the finite ADCP reach limits the description of the vertical extent of\n\nthe currents as well as of the PE. In order to estimate the velocities on a larger part of\n\nthe water column for investigation of the PE vertical structure and water mass transport,\n\nwe use the classical dynamic method. However, due to the proximity to the equator, we\n\nfirst make an assessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation for the Potiguar\n\nBight. As part of this assessment, we calculate the Rossby number of the PE by getting\n\nthe mean magnitude of the velocity on a ring of the Potiguar eddy with mean width of\n\n70 km, using the -4 \u00d7 104 m2s?1 streamline as outer limit. Then, we divide by the value\n\nof the Coriolis parameter on the area multiplied by the mean distance between the corre-\n\nspondent streamline and the eddy core, i. e., its radius (Equation 2.3). The values used on\n\nthe Rossby number calculation are presented on Table 2.2.\n\nRo =\nU\n\nfoR\n(2.3)\n\nwhere U is the mean velocity magnitude between two closed streamlines; fo is the Coriolis\n\nparameter at the eddy center; and R is the mean radius of the Potiguar Eddy.\n\nFigure 2.18 shows the area used for the calculation of the Rossby number on the\n\nassessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation for the Potiguar Bight. As a\n\nresult, we got a mean Rossby number of ? 0.4 for the eddy core depth and of ? 0.22\n\n\n\n31\n\nif averaged over the eddy thickness of 250 m (i.e., averaged over H, which is the mean\n\nthickness between the 24.5-26.8 kg.m?3 isopycnal interval).\n\nFigure 2.18: Map with the ADCP-derived velocity vectors at 150 m for ONEII cruise\n\n(October - December 2004). The area used for the Rossby number calculation is in blue.\n\nBesides the Rossby number, in order to evaluate the role of stratification on the\n\nmaintainance of the PE, the Burger number was calculated, according to Equation 2.4,\n\nwith the values presented on Table 2.2. The Burger number was calculated with informa-\n\ntion from three hydrographic sections that were sampled within the eddy (sections 8, 9\n\nand 10, Figure 2.1, right panel) during ONEII. The mean Burger number for the PE sam-\n\npled during ONEII is approximately 1. Therefore, we conclude that the stratification is as\n\nimportant as the horizontal velocity shear on the maintainance of the PE, characterizing\n\nthe PE as a typical mesoscale structure of the tropical-equatorial region.\n\nBu =\n\n????g ????

The general pattern from the ADCP sections is well represented\n\nin the geostrophic velocities, even though the geostrophic NBUC is weaker and closer to\n\nthe shore in both sections. The weaker NBUC reflects in smaller transports in geostrophic\n\nsections when compared to the ADCP data. In ONEI Section 8, the geostrophic NBUC\n\ntransports 18.56 Sv, in comparison to 26.39 from ADCP data. The geostrophic eddy,\n\non the other hand, is stronger than the one shown in ADCP data, transporting 1.74 Sv,\n\ncompared to 0.92 Sv. On ONEII Section 9, the geostrophic NBUC transports 22.49 Sv in\n\ncontrast to 26.91 shown in ADCP data. The geostrophic eddy in this instance is somewhat\n\nweaker than shown in ADCP data, transporting about 1.61 Sv compared to 2.37 Sv from\n\nADCP data. All these transport values were calculated between the surface and 300 m\n\ndepth, in order to compare the geostrophic and ADCP velocity fields. We consider the\n\nagreement reasonable, so we analyze the geostrophic velocities down to 1500 m (ONEI)\n\nand 1800 m (ONEII), beyond the ADCP reach.\n\n\n\n33\n\nFigure 2.19: Comparison between the geostrophic velocity referenced to the ?1=32.15\n\nkg.m?3 isopycnal (middle and bottom panels) and ADCP velocity (top panel) for tran-\n\nsect 8 from ONEI (February - March 2002).

The isopycnals ??=24.5 kg.m?3\n\nand ??=26.8 kg.m?3 are also shown.\n\n\n\n34\n\nFigure 2.20: Comparison between the geostrophic velocity referenced to the ?1=32.15\n\nkg.m?3 isopycnal (middle and bottom panels) and ADCP velocity (top panel) for tran-\n\nsect 9 from ONEII (October - December 2004).

The shaded area on the middle and bot-\n\ntom panels indicates the portion of the plot which is generated by extrapolation. Inverted\n\ntriangles indicate the location of oceanographic stations. The isopycnals ??=24.5 kg.m?3\n\nand ??=26.8 kg.m?3 are also shown.\n\n\n\n35\n\nThe geostrophic velocity sections (Figures 2.19 and 2.20, middle and bottom\n\npanels) show the NBUC reaching 800 and 1100 m in ONEI and ONEII, respectively,\n\nconsidering the 0.1 m.s?1 isotach as the limit of the current. In both sections the NBUC\n\ntransports Tropical Water (TW), South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and Antarctic\n\nIntermediate Water (AIA). The NBUC transport varies between sections: on ONEI it is\n\n24.78 Sv (7.5 Sv AT, 10.35 Sv SACW, 6.95 Sv AIA) and during ONEII it increases to\n\n43.35 Sv (7.8 Sv AT, 15.06 Sv SACW, 20.47 Sv AIA). So the large difference in transport\n\nis mostly due to an increase of the transport in the AIA layer during ONEII. The difference\n\nbetween the transport calculated from ADCP velocities (between the surface and 300 m,\n\ntherefore not accounting for any transport in the AIA range) between both cruises is not\n\nnearly as large; only about 0.5 Sv.\n\nIn both sections the eddy has no surface signature, with the velocity transition\n\nfrom the northwestward surface flow to the southeastward subsurface flow at about 80-\n\n100 m. The eddy is confined between the coast and 40 km off the coast, and in both\n\ngeostrophic sections it appears with two cores; one closer to the surface, at about 100-200\n\nm, and another at about 350 m. In addition, on the ONEI geostrophic velocity section\n\n8 a possible third core of the eddy can be identified at approximately 550 m. The trans-\n\nport of the eddy is 1.97 Sv and 2.07 Sv during ONEI and ONEII, respectively, mostly\n\nmade of SACW (approximately 1.7 Sv) with a smaller amount of water in the AIA layer\n\n(approximately 0.7 Sv).\n\n\n\n36\n\n2.3 Discussion\n\nThe Western Equatorial Atlantic has been a region of great interest of the oceano-\n\ngraphic community due to its importance in the Interhemispheric heat and mass transport.\n\nWith the intent of investigating the role of this region on the Conveyor belt, most studies\n\nfocus either on the northeast coast of South America, or in an equatorial section along\n\n44oW (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; STRAMMA et al., 1995; SCHOTT et al., 1995; FIS-\n\nCHER and SCHOTT, 1997; SCHOTT et al., 1998; SCHOTT et al., 2002; SCHOTT et\n\nal., 2003; SCHOTT et al., 2005; GOES et al., 2005; RICHARDSON and FRATANTONI,\n\n1999). The flow south of the equator, specifically, was mostly investigated with repeated\n\nzonal sections at 10oS and 5oS, and a meridional section at 35oW, preventing the detailed\n\nanalysis of mesoscale horizontal structures in this region. The only study that focuses on\n\nmesoscale features between 5o and 10oS is the study of Silveira et al. (1994), in which\n\nthe fine sampling grid allowed the authors to identify the previously unknown subsurface\n\ncharacter of the NBC in its formation area, as well as other mesoscale features such as\n\nthe retroflection to generate the SEUC. With a finer sampling grid than most of the previ-\n\nous studies in the region, in this dissertation we were able to identify the changes on the\n\nNBUC regime that take place as this current flows equatorward.\n\nThe analysis of the data-set between 11o S and 6oS showed the NBUC with\n\nits core at approximately 200 m, presenting no shoaling in the downstream direction.\n\nDuring ONEI cruise the core was slightly (? 50 m) deeper and the near-surface velocities\n\nstronger, yielding a larger transport of the NBUC on this realization. This seems to be\n\nrelated to the seasonal variation of the winds over the Equatorial Atlantic. With weaker\n\nwinds during February, the Ekman transport during ONEI was weaker, allowing for the\n\nnear-surface northward velocities to be stronger. In both cruises, the NBUC core was\n\nattached to the continental slope. Our results corroborate previous studies (SILVEIRA et\n\nal., 1994; GOES et al., 2005; STRAMMA et al., 1995; SCHOTT et al., 2002; SCHOTT\n\net al., 2005). Also, the near-surface ADCP-derived streamfunction maps for this region\n\nfor the ONEI cruise (February-March, 2002), show a bifurcation of the cSEC, with one\n\nbranch going south and then making a cyclonic turn to feed into the NBUC; this is very\n\nsimilar to the observed by Silveira et al. (1994), whose data acquisition months (May-\n\n\n\n37\n\nJuly) were similar to the ONEI cruise (February-March). The presence of this cyclonic\n\nturn in ONEI cruise and during Silveira et al. (1994)\u2019s cruise may indicate a seasonality of\n\nthis feature. During ONEII cruise, which took place in October-December, this cyclonic\n\nturn of the cSEC was not identified.\n\nBetween 6o and 4oS, we identified significant changes in the NBUC regime, as\n\nit receives large contribution from the cSEC (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; LUMPKIN and\n\nGARZOLI, 2005), increasing its transport. Another difference between the flow in this\n\nregion and the upstream NBUC is the flow in its opposite direction, with a core of ?\n\n0.4 m.s?1 at 200-250 m depth, at approximately 160 km off the coast. The analysis\n\nof streamfunction and velocity maps for both cruises at 144 m indicate that this flow\n\ncorresponds to the SEUC, being fed into by a retroflection of the NBUC, as also indicated\n\nby Silveira et al. (1994) and Stramma et al. (1995).\n\nNorth of 4oS, one of the main studies on synoptical horizontal distribution of\n\nocean currents is from Goes et al. (2005). These authors use ADCP, CTDO2, and XBT\n\ndata to analyze the source waters of the currents in the region and identify their pathways\n\nclose to the Equator. They also calculate the streamfunction distribution for the flow in\n\nthe area between 35oW and 44oW, but were not able to describe in detail the circulation\n\nin the region of the Potiguar Bight due to the lack of data in this area. The finer resolution\n\nof the sampling grid of the data-set analyzed in this dissertation allowed a more thorough\n\ninvestigation of the mesoscale structures on the northeastern coast of South America,\n\nspecially in the region between 36oW and 37oW, where we found that the NBUC presents\n\na particular and previously undescribed behavior.\n\nThis region, as we found in this dissertation, is unique in the sense that the NBUC\n\nis not attached to the coast, but located at about 150 km from it. The NBUC core in these\n\nsections has strong velocities of about 0.8-1.3 m.s?1, at 100-150 m depth, with a near-\n\nsurface (32 m) signature of 0.4-0.6 m.s?1. Attached to the coast is a 0.3-0.6 m.s?1 core\n\nof southeastward velocities, at approximately 150-200 m depth, which, after analysis of\n\nstreamfunction maps, we found to be a recirculation of the NBUC, which we named\n\nPotiguar Eddy (PE). This feature had not been described by any of the previous studies in\n\nthe area; specifically, the study from Goes et al. (2005) lacked enough data to analyze in\n\n\n\n38\n\ndetail the ocean currents in this region.\n\nThe PE is an elliptical shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately\n\n330 and 130 km, with a subsurface signature. It is centered at about 36oW, 4oS, and ex-\n\ntends from 100 m to 400 m, with maximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1, recirculating about 2\n\nSv of the water from the NBUC. The subsurface nature of this feature is not something un-\n\nprecedent in the Western Equatorial Atlantic. Subsurface-intensified rings with no surface\n\nsignature have been reported to pinch off the NBC retroflection, further north of our study\n\narea, and translate northwestward (GARRAFFO et al., 2003). Johns et al. (2003), specifi-\n\ncally, report a NBC retroflection ring with characteristics that resemble the PE. Their \u201dring\n\n1\u201d was identified at ? 8oN with maximum velocities at approximately 150 m, extending\n\nvertically from 50-100 m to about 400 m. This eddy, as the PE, was assymetric, with a\n\nstronger and deeper-reaching nortwestward velocities lobe when compared to the south-\n\neastward velocities one, with both lobes with velocities comparable to the ones present in\n\nthe PE. This feature has a ? 200 km diameter, which also makes it comparable to the PE,\n\neven though their process of generation clearly differ. As the PE, Johns et al. (2003)\u2019s\n\nring 1 had no signature in altimetry data. The lack of altimetry signature is probably one\n\nof the main reasons why subsurface-intensified NBC rings as well as the PE remained un-\n\ndetected for so long. After the estimation of its Rossby and Burger numbers, we reach the\n\nconclusion that, as expected, this is a typical mesoscale feature of the Western Equatorial\n\nAtlantic, with reasonable correspondence between geostrophic velocities within the eddy\n\nand global numerical model outputs due to a dominant geostrophic balance. As a matter\n\nof fact, the upper-bound Rossby number value of about 0.4 is comparable with the 0.36\n\nestimated by Silveira et al. (2000) for the NBC retroflection deep eddies at 5oN. These\n\nauthors used quasi-geostrophic theory to investigate the anticiclone dynamics. Moreover,\n\nif the PE depth-average Rossby number is considered, the value of 0.22 is very typical\n\nfrom the supbtropical western boundary currents at temperate latitudes. As examples, the\n\nBrazil Current semi-permanent anticiclones off the Eastern Brazilian continental margin,\n\npresented by Soutelino et al. (2013) at 15oS-20oS have Ro of about 0.20.\n\nFurther downstream, between 38oW and 41oW, the southeastward flow from PE\n\nis not detected close to the coast; instead, the NBUC is again attached to the continental\n\n\n\n39\n\nslope. The surface expression of the NBUC, in this case caused by the contribution from\n\nthe cSEC, increases, reaching 0.7 m.s?1 at 41oW. The NBUC on these sections occupy\n\na much larger portion of the water column, with a width of about 200 km compared to\n\naproximately 100 km on the previous transects. There is not a clear surface core; the\n\nNBUC core is still located at about 150 m depth. Only in 41oW there seems to be a\n\nsurface core being formed, which is in agreement with Schott et al. (1998), who indicate\n\nthat the NBUC/cSEC turns into the surface-intensified NBC only at 44oW.\n\nAditionally, at about 1oS, between 37oW - 39oW, a flow in the opposite direction\n\nof the NBUC is identified. This flow increases in velocity northwestward, reaching maxi-\n\nmum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 at about 39oW. The analysis of streamfunction maps indicate\n\nthat this flow corresponds to the retroflected thermocline portion of the NBUC to form\n\nthe Equatorial undercurrent, corroborating the study of Goes et al. (2005); Schott et al.\n\n(1998); Urbano et al. (2008).\n\nThis chapter presented the characteristics and changes of the NBUC along its\n\npath equatorward, and some features associated with this current, such as the retroflec-\n\ntions to feed into the EUC and SEUC. The NBUC main characteristics, such as transport,\n\ncore depth, and width are in agreement with previous studies, as well as the location,\n\ntransport and depth of the two mentioned retroflections. Here we stress the identification\n\nof the Potiguar Eddy, due to the fact that it had not been yet described in the scientific\n\nliterature. On this chapter we were only able to provide evidence of its existence from\n\ntwo oceanographic cruises; on the next, we will adress its permanence/recurrence and\n\ntemporal variability.\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTemporal Variability\n\nAfter characterizing the eddy, a few questions remain unanswered. We can esti-\n\nmate the transport and the water masses transported by the PE observed in oceanographic\n\ncruises, but is that feature permanent in the Potiguar Bight? The evidence of its existence\n\nin both cruises suggests so, but the analyses of current meter time series are necessary for\n\nmaking definitive statements. In this section we use moored and altimetry data, as well as\n\nnumerical model outputs, in order to investigate whether the PE is stationary or recurrent,\n\nas well as address the intraseasonal variability that the PE may present.\n\n3.1 Data sets\n\n3.1.1 Mooring Data\n\nData from two moorings, hereafter Potiguar Basin 1 (PBM1) and Potiguar Basin\n\n2 (PBM2), from PETRO?LEO BRASILEIRO S.A., were analyzed in terms of the vertical\n\nstructure of the Potiguar Eddy as well as its time-dependent behavior. The two moorings\n\nwere deployed on the continental slope of the Potiguar Bight, and the detailed information\n\nabout period of data acquisition, sampling frequency, instruments used, and other details\n\nare presented on the following paragraphs.\n\nThe PBM1 mooring had upward-looking 75kHz Teledyne RD-Instruments ADCP\n\nand Aquadopp instruments. It was deployed approximately over the 1000 m isobath at\n\n4.2o S, 37.2o W (Figure 3.1), with ADCP data from the near-surface (44 m) down to 444\n\n41\n\n\n\n42\n\nm, with 10-meter cells. At 800 and 995 m, hourly currents were measured by Aquadopp\n\ncurrent meters. All instruments were set to acquire velocity data hourly. This mooring\n\nwas deployed on April 6th, 2008 and retrieved on April 12th, 2009, and had three cam-\n\npaigns for data recovery and redeployment. Due to instrument failure, the dataset could\n\nonly be used until November 8th, 2008.\n\nMooring PBM2 also had upward-looking 75kHz Teledyne RD-Instruments ADCP\n\nand Aquadopp instruments, and was deployed close to mooring PBM1, approximately\n\nover the 2000 m isobath at 3.9o S, 37o W (Figure 3.1). Velocity data were acquired by an\n\nADCP system from the near-surface (35 m) down to 365 m, with 10-meter cells. Further\n\ndownward, velocity data at 800, 1200, 1600, and 1995 m were acquired by Aquadopp\n\ncurrent meters, with all instruments set to acquire velocity data hourly.\n\nThe PBM2 mooring was deployed and retrieved on the same dates as mooring\n\nPBM1 (April 6th, 2008 - April 12th, 2009), also with three campaigns for data recovery\n\nand redeployment. There was no instrument failure in PBM2, therefore the dataset could\n\nbe used in its entire extent. The site of the deployment of both moorings is close to\n\nONEII section 9, as shown on Figure 3.1. It is noteworthy that both moorings are located\n\non the area that the ADCP sections indicate as the nearshore lobe of the PE, therefore the\n\nmooring-acquired velocities are southeastward over the vertical extent of the eddy.\n\nFigure 3.1: Location of the PBM1 and PBM2 moorings, with the mean velocity vectors\n\nfor 44 m (blue) and 144 m (red).\n\n\n\n43\n\n3.1.2 Numerical Model Outputs\n\nConsidering the coarse oceanographic cruise data and the small time span of the\n\nmooring data, we use the outputs of a global model to address the longer variability and\n\npersistence of the Potiguar Eddy. We analyze 8 years of results from a Hybrid Coordinate\n\nOcean Model (HYCOM) assimilative run, carried out by the HYCOM Consortium with\n\nresults available on the web (HYCOM, 2014). This run has a 1/12o horizontal resolution,\n\nwhich translates to a 8 km spacing near the equator, and is configured vertically for 32\n\nhybrid layers. The surface forcing is from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Pre-\n\ndiction System (NOGAPS) including wind stress, wind speed, heat flux and precipitation.\n\nThe data assimilation scheme used is the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation\n\n(NCODA) system (CUMMINGS, 2005), which assimilates alongtrack satellite altimeter\n\nobservations, satellite and in-situ Sea Surface Temperature, as well as temperature and\n\nsalinity profiles from expendable bathythermographs (XBTs), ARGO floats and moored\n\nbuoys. The downward projection of the surface information is made using Cooper and\n\nHaines (1996) scheme. A total of 8 years (Nov/2003-December/2011) of daily temper-\n\nature, salinity, altimetry, zonal and meridional velocity model results were analyzed, on\n\nthe Potiguar Bight (35o W - 38o W; 6o S, 3o S, and on a zonal section at 4o S.\n\n3.1.3 Altimetry Data\n\nIn order to characterize the variability found in mooring velocities, we turn to\n\nsatellite sea level anomaly data. The altimetry data that we use are merged dual-satellite\n\nanomalies referenced to the 1993-2012 period from the Archiving, Validation and Inter-\n\npretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO). The product that we used is level\n\n4, delayed-time, with a 0.25 degree zonal and meridional resolution, part of project\n\nSSALTO/Duacs (AVISO, 2014). We use altimetry data over the 4o S latitude, over the\n\nentire Atlantic Ocean, between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st, 2009. The 4o S\n\nsection was chosen in order to investigate processes that could be originated in the At-\n\nlantic Ocean, propagate westward, and reach the locations of the moorings, which are\n\napproximately at 4o S. The time span was chosen to include the time-period of the HY-\n\nCOM numerical model results, ONEII cruise synoptic data, and mooring data.\n\n\n\n44\n\n3.2 Observed Intraseasonal Variability\n\n3.2.1 Current meter mooring mean patterns\n\nThe velocity vectors of the mooring acquired data were rotated (65 degrees anti-\n\nclockwise) into alongshore and crossshore components, conventioned that the southeast-\n\nward velocities are positive. The rotated mean profiles for moorings PBM1 and PBM2\n\n(Figures 3.2 and 3.3, respectively) show the mean magnitude of the NBUC and the PE.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 3.2, right panel, the PE is present on the southeastward\n\nmean moored velocity profile, extends from about 60 m to 264 m on PBM1, with its 0.46\n\nm.s?1 core located at 144 m depth. On PBM2 (Figure 3.3, right panel), further offshore,\n\nthe PE is also identified on the mean profile, occupying a larger portion of the water\n\ncolumn and extending from 100 m to 430 m, with a deeper and weaker 0.32 m.s?1 core\n\nat 200 m depth. Below the PE, westward/northwestward mean velocities are observed,\n\nstronger on PBM1 (? 0.2 m.s?1) than on PBM2 (? 0.15 m.s?1). The (northwestward)\n\nmean surface flow, on the other hand, is stronger on PBM2 (0.45 m.s?1) than on PBM1\n\n(0.2 m.s?1).\n\nFigure 3.2: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for mooring PBM1. Positive\n\nvalues of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeastward) flow.\n\n\n\n45\n\nFigure 3.3: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for mooring PBM2.\n\nPositive values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeast-\n\nward) flow.\n\nComparing the mean velocity profile of PBM1 (Figure 3.2) and ONEII section 9\n\n(Figure 2.16), it is noticeable the resemblance between the mean profile from the mooring\n\nline and the nearshore portion of the ONEII velocity section. In both the velocity inversion\n\nassociated with the upper limit of the eddy is at about 50-100 m, and in both the core of\n\nthe PE is at about 150 m depth. The signature of the PE on the mean alongshore velocity\n\nprofiles for both moorings strongly suggest that this is a permanent feature in the area.\n\n3.2.2 Current Meter Mooring Time Series Analysis\n\nIn order to investigate the variability of the system, we performed Empirical\n\nOrthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the alongshore velocity data of both moorings.\n\nAfter the EOF analysis of the data, we followed Preisendorfer (1988) and used Montecarlo\n\nsimulations in order to assure which EOF modes are significant at the 95% confidence\n\nlevel.\n\nFor PBM1, we found four statistically significant modes of variability (Figure\n\n3.4), explaining 60%, 16%, 8%, and 5% of the variance of the original series. For PBM2\n\n\n\n46\n\ndata, on the other hand, 5 statistically significant modes were found (Figure 3.5), sug-\n\ngesting that more processes take place on mooring PBM2, therefore that the variability\n\npattern is more complex at this location.\n\nWe focus on the two modes that have the highest explained variance percentage,\n\ni. e., the first and second EOF modes. Since the vertical structure for the first two modes\n\nof the moorings is similar, we describe them together.\n\nFigure 3.4: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the observed\n\nPBM1 data and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained\n\nvariance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents\n\nthe mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo\n\nsimulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the\n\nmean.\n\nOn the vertical structure of the first EOF for PBM1 (Figure 3.6), the highest\n\namplitude is located at the part of the water column corresponding to the lower half of\n\nthe eddy, with peak amplitude at about 270 m depth. On the remaining of the water\n\ncolumn, the amplitude decreases considerably, reaching values very close to zero close to\n\nthe surface and at the bottom.\n\nThe vertical structure of the first EOF for PBM2, explaining 37% of the variance\n\nof the original time-series, is shown on Figure 3.7. It presents high values over the water\n\n\n\n47\n\ncolumn corresponding to the lower half of the mean PE (compare Figures 3.7 and 3.3,\n\nright panel) , with highest values at about 350 m depth, corroborating the information\n\npresented by the first EOF for PBM1.\n\nFigure 3.5: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the observed\n\nPBM2 data and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained\n\nvariance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents\n\nthe mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo\n\nsimulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the\n\nmean.\n\nThe vertical structure of the second EOF (Figure 3.8) for PBM1 has as main\n\nfeature its peak amplitude approximately at the depth of the upper boundary of the eddy,\n\nwith relatively high values between the near-surface layer and about 200 m. The ampli-\n\ntude zero-crossing takes place at approximately 250 m, close to the lower boundary of\n\nthe mean PE. On the remaining of the water column the amplitude presents small values,\n\nvirtually reaching zero at the bottom.\n\n\n\n48\n\nFigure 3.6: Vertical structure of the first EOF for mooring PBM1 (top panel) and ampli-\n\ntude time series for the first EOF mode for PBM1 (bottom panel).\n\nFigure 3.9 shows the vertical structure of the second EOF for PBM2. This EOF\n\nexplains 19% of the variance of the original data, with highest amplitude at about 100 m,\n\ndecreasing sharply and presenting low values on the remainder of the water column. The\n\n100 m depth is roughly the depth of the first velocity inversion on the mean alongshore\n\nprofile, i. e., the upper boundary of the PE. This also corroborates the information given\n\nby the EOF analysis of PBM1, in which the second EOF represents variability on the\n\ndepth of the upper limit of the eddy.\n\n\n\n49\n\nFigure 3.7: Vertical structure of the first EOF for mooring PBM2 (top panel) and ampli-\n\ntude time series for the first EOF mode for PBM2 (bottom panel).\n\nThe comparison between the mean alongshore velocity profile of both moorings\n\n(Figures 3.2 and 3.3, right panels) and the vertical structure of the EOFs (Figures 3.6,\n\n3.8,3.7 and 3.9) allows a better interpretation of these patterns of variability. The verti-\n\ncal structure of the first EOF, with highest amplitudes close to the lower boundary of the\n\nmean PE, indicates that the main pattern of variability (explaining 60% and 37% of the\n\nvariance of the time-series of PBM1 and PBM2, respectively) at the location of the moor-\n\nings is associated with the increase/decrease of the vertical extent of the eddy, due to the\n\nvariation on the depth of its lower boundary. The vertical structure of the second EOF, on\n\nthe other hand, indicates that lower, but still important variability (16% and 19% of the\n\n\n\n50\n\nvariance of the time-series of PBM1 and PBM2, respectively) is due to the variation of\n\nthe depth of the upper boundary of the PE by upper layer processes, which also implicates\n\nin an increase/decrease of its vertical extent. In short, these two modes combined have an\n\neffect of increasing/decreasing of the PE vertical extent, mainly due to variations on its\n\nlower limit, with a smaller contribution from variations on its upper limit. Considering\n\nthe subpycnoclinic nature of the eddy and that the first EOF mode explains a larger per-\n\ncentage of the variance of the original time-series for PBM1 as well as PBM2, here we\n\nwill concentrate on the analysis of the first EOF mode, for both moorings.\n\nFigure 3.8: Vertical structure of the second EOF for mooring PBM1 (top panel) and\n\namplitude time series for the second EOF mode for PBM1 (bottom panel).\n\n\n\n51\n\nFigure 3.9: Vertical structure of the second EOF for mooring PBM2 (top panel) and\n\namplitude time series for the second EOF mode for PBM2 (bottom panel).\n\nTo evaluate the periodicity of the identified variability, we performed wavelet\n\nanalysis on the amplitude time-series of the first EOF mode for both moorings. Classi-\n\ncal Fourier analysis was not performed due to the non-stationary character of the series,\n\nas shown in Figures 3.6 and 3.7, bottom panels). The resuls of the wavelet analysis are\n\nshown in Figures 3.10 and 3.11 for PBM1 and PBM2, respectively. Also, for compar-\n\nison between the plots for PBM1 and PBM2, it must be stressed that the length of the\n\ntime- series differ between the moorings (eight months for PBM1; one year for PBM2).\n\nAfter these considerations, the analysis of the plots show that the highest energy of the\n\namplitude time series of the first EOF is concentrated at periods of 25-35 days, for both\n\n\n\n52\n\nmoorings, between July and December. For the remainder of the year, these oscilations\n\nare either absent or much weaker. Data from PBM1 presents these oscilations also on the\n\nperiod between May and August, weaker than during July-December. For both moorings,\n\nthe period of the oscilation remains at about 25 days until the end of September, when it\n\nincreases to about 35 days.\n\nFigure 3.10: Wavelet analysis of the amplitude time-series for the first EOF for the along-\n\nshore velocity data for PBM1.\n\nIn order to better understand the EOF-derived variability found on the PE, we\n\ncalculate the dynamical modes on the area of the moorings\u2019 deployment, following the\n\nprocedure of Silveira et al. (2008). For the calculation, we use the ONEs cruises temper-\n\nature and salinity profiles located closest to the location of deployment of the moorings,\n\nusing a total of four profiles. The vertical structure of the dynamical modes for moorings\n\nPBM1 and PBM2 are shown on Figures 3.12 and 3.13, respectively.\n\nAfter calculating the dynamical modes, in order to understand which ones play\n\nkey roles on the variability of the system, we project the dynamical modes onto the EOF\n\nvertical structures. This enables us to characterize physically the variability experienced\n\nby the system.\n\n\n\n53\n\nFigure 3.11: Wavelet analysis of the amplitude time-series for the first EOF for the along-\n\nshore velocity data for PBM2.\n\nFigure 3.12: Vertical structure of the barotropic and first three baroclinic modes for\n\nmooring PBM1.\n\n\n\n54\n\nThe projection of the dynamical modes onto the first EOF for moorings PBM1\n\nand PBM2 (Figures 3.14 and 3.15) suggests a predominance of the second baroclinic\n\nmode on their vertical structures. The barotropic and first baroclinic modes have little\n\ncontribution; the resemblance with the vertical profile of the EOF just visibly increases\n\nwhen the second baroclinic mode is taken into account. Surely, with the addition of the\n\nthird baroclinic mode, the similarity between the recomposed and the original EOF profile\n\nincreases. Therefore, the variability presented by the PE is primarily a second baroclinic\n\nmode one.\n\nFigure 3.13: Vertical structure of the barotropic and first three baroclinic modes for\n\nmooring PBM2.\n\nAfter identifying which dynamical mode plays the key role on the variability in\n\nthe system, we turn to the linear wave theory in order to determine if the signal that reaches\n\nthe Potiguar Eddy can be interpreted as a linear wave. We use the linear Rossby wave\n\ndispersion relationship (e.g., PEDLOSKY, 1986), considering no meridional propagation\n\n(meridional wavenumber equal to zero). If the signals in the EOF mode amplitudes are\n\nindeed from Rossby waves, they can just be generated eastward of the Potiguar Bight and\n\nthen propagate westward. We thus choose a second-mode Rossby deformation radius Rd2\n\n\n\n55\n\nfor the Atlantic Ocean at 4oS, ? 20o W, of 206 km. The depth considered was 3300 m.\n\n? =\n??k\n\nk2 + R?2d2\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere ? is the wave frequency, ? is the meridional gradient of planetary vorticity, k is the\n\nzonal wavenumber, and Rd2 is the second baroclinic Rossby deformation radius. We then\n\nplot the dispersion curve for such waves. The peak of the curve corresponds to 29-day\n\nwaves. Hence, only waves longer than this period are associated to the linear Rossby\n\nwaves. We thus take the value for the period of 35 days from the wavelet analysis of\n\nthe amplitude time series of the first EOF mode. We then use the dispersion relation to\n\nobtain the two k values via Equation 3.1 corresponding to the 25-day and 35-day waves.\n\nAs a result, we present the linear Rossby wave dispersion diagram in Figure 3.16. The\n\nwavelengths associated with these 35-day waves are shown in Table 3.1. We therefore\n\nconclude by inspection of Figure 3.16 that linear free second-mode Rossby waves can be\n\nused to approximate to the signal that dominates the first EOF mode amplitude time series\n\nof both moorings.\n\nFigure 3.14: Projection of the dynamical modes onto the first EOF for mooring PBM1.\n\n\n\n56\n\nFigure 3.15: Projection of the dynamical modes onto the first EOF for mooring PBM2.\n\nTable 3.1: Properties of the 35-day linear free second-mode Rossby waves in the Tropical\n\nAtlantic.\n\nProperty name Property symbol Larger root Smaller root\n\nzonal wavenumber k 8.0 \u00d7 10?3 km?1 9.9 \u00d7 10?4 km?1\n\nwavelength ? 790 km 2118 km\n\nphase velocity cph -0.37 m.s?1 -0.98 m.s?1\n\nThe two roots of Equation 3.1 and listed in Table 3.1 are related to dispersive\n\nRossby waves. The larger one is of a 790 km wave. Half wavelength corresponding to\n\nalternate cyclones and anticyclones are about 395 km. The size of the Rossby vortical\n\nstructures then approximately matches the PE major axis and is likely to either enhance\n\nor decrease its signal. The phase speed is about 0.37 m.s?1 in the westward direction\n\nwhile the group speed is in the eastward direction. The smaller root is associated with a\n\n2118 km wave that propagates both phase and energy westward. The question posed now\n\nis which of these two affects the Potiguar Eddy.\n\nWe now turn to altimetry data in order to look for signals with similar period-\n\nicity and seek to find its wavelength. Here we use a finite impulse response (FIR) filter\n\n\n\n57\n\n(POLITO and LIU, 2003) to investigate these oscillations. For this filter, we use a value\n\nas a first guess, and then through Radon transform the filter does some \u201dfine tunning\u201d and\n\nreturns the filtered field and the periods and wavelengths contained in the data that are\n\nwithin a previously specified uncertainty range from the first guess.\n\nFigure 3.16: Dispersion relation for second-mode baroclinic Rossby Waves. The black\n\nbar denotes the frequency corresponding to the period of 35 days, as estimated from\n\nthe currentmeter mooring time series. The black cross denotes the period of 33.8 days\n\ndepicted from the altimeter data analysis.\n\nThe filtering of the altimetry data (Figure 3.17) reveals ? 34-day signals west\n\nof 15oW in the Atlantic Ocean. As shown in Figure 3.17, these waves are not generated\n\nthrougout the year, but mostly during June-July, reaching the northeastern tip of South\n\nAmerica during September-December. This information corroborates the findings from\n\nthe wavelet analysis of the amplitude time series of the first EOF; both altmetry and ampli-\n\ntude time series present a very similar period of oscillation and seasonality on its intensity.\n\nConsidering these similarities, we believe the 34-day signals to be clearly associated with\n\n\n\n58\n\nthe ? 35-day oscillations found on the velocity data.\n\nFigure 3.17: Time-Longitude diagram 33-day waves along 4oS from AVISO altimetric\n\nSea Surface Height data (in meters).\n\n\n\n59\n\nIn summary, the comparison of the wavelength and frequency found by the FIR\n\nfilter and the values from the linear wave theory show very good agreement. The theoreti-\n\ncal wavelength for the 34-day period yielded a 790 km wavelength, very similar to the 811\n\nkm found by the FIR. The FIR-estimated phase speed of about 0.30 m.s?1 is also similar\n\nto the 0.37 estimated theoretically. The fact that information from the linear wave theory,\n\namplitude time series of EOF from velocity data, and altimetry converge is an indication\n\nthat our results are robust, as the process under investigation indeed consists in Rossby\n\nWaves reaching the continental margin.\n\n3.3 Modeled Temporal Variability\n\n3.3.1 Model Validation\n\nAfter characterizing the PE through mooring data, due to the short period of data\n\nacquisition (8 months for PBM1, one year for PBM2), we analyze 8 years (Nov/2003-\n\nDecember/2011) of HYCOM model results in order to investigate annual and interannual\n\nvariability associated with the PE. The HYCOM results, with its 1/12o horizontal reso-\n\nlution, help on the characterization of the regional scenario in order to better understand\n\nthe processes causing variability on the PE. We first perform a validation of the model\n\nresults, to assure that they are a good tool for analyzing the kinematics and the dynamics\n\non the Potiguar Bight region. Figure 3.18 shows the mean streamfunction map for model\n\nresults, which pattern closely resembles the ONEII streamfunction map at 144 m (Figure\n\n2.9, bottom panel), even though with lower magnitude (i. e., less shear). The clear signa-\n\nture of the PE in a 8-year mean streamfunction field, as well in a series of streamfunction\n\nsnapshots over these 8-years (not shown), are an indication that the modeled eddy, as well\n\nas the observed eddy, is a permanent feature is the region. The PE on model results is, as\n\non the ONEII data, confined within the Potiguar Bight, with a size comparable to the size\n\nof the PE depicted on ONEII data: major axis measures ? 330 km; minor axis measures\n\n93 km.\n\nIn order to investigate if the modeled and observed PE are in the same dynamical\n\nregime, we use the same methodology as used for the obervational data: we calculate the\n\n\n\n60\n\nRossby number using the mean velocity magnitude in concentric streamlines of the eddy,\n\non the mean streamfunction map at ? 150 m depth (Figure 3.19).\n\nFigure 3.18: Mean (2003-2011) streamfunction map from HYCOM results at 150 m\n\ndepth.\n\nThe first difference between Figure 3.19 and its counterpart from ONEII data\n\n(Figure 2.9) is the intensity; as noted earlier, the observed eddy is stronger than the mod-\n\neled one. Also, the observed NBUC seems to detach more from the coast, resulting in a\n\nlarger minor axis in observational data than in model results, therefore a more rounded\n\nshape of the PE in observational data. After calculating the Rossby number, we obtained a\n\nmean value of 0.35, which suggests that the modeled eddy in fact is in a similar dynamical\n\nregime as the observed PE.\n\n\n\n61\n\nAnother part of the validation is the mean cross-eddy section of the modeled\n\nPE (Figure 3.20). The mean cross eddy HYCOM velocity section shows a weaker NBUC\n\nthan the geostrophic sections, but the flow pattern is realistic. The transport of the modeled\n\nPE is 1.3 Sv, slightly lower than that indicated by the observational data, and the major and\n\nminor axis are in reasonable agreement, measuring 300 and 130 km, respectively (Figure\n\n3.18). Considering the similarity between the observed and modeled eddy concerning\n\ndynamical regime, size, transport and vertical extent, we turn to investigate the model\n\nresults for variability of the PE of longer time scales.\n\nFigure 3.19: Map with the mean (2003-2011) velocity vectors at 150 m for HYCOM\n\nresults. The area used on the calculation of the Rossby number is in blue.\n\n\n\n62\n\nFigure 3.20: Mean (2003-2011) cross-eddy velocity section from HYCOM results. Dashed\n\nvelocities are northwestward. The ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 and ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopycnals are plotted.\n\n3.3.2 Analysis of the HYCOM Model Time Series\n\nIn order to investigate the time-variability of the model eddy we consider two\n\nsynthetic moorings, in the same location as the PBM1 amd PBM2 moorings. The mean\n\nrotated velocity profile for synthetic moorings PBM1 and PBM2 (Figures 3.21 and 3.22)\n\nprovide more evidence that, on the mean, the PE is present on the model results, with its\n\ncore at slightly less than 200 m depth. Also, we see that, in agreement with the observed\n\neddy, the mean model PE does not have surface expression, presenting its upper boundary\n\nat about 100 m depth, in both synthetic moorings. Also, the mean vertical extent of the\n\nmodeled eddy is about 250 m, somewhat less than the observed PE. Another difference\n\nbetween the synthetic and the observed moored velocity data is the velocity magnitude.\n\nThe modeled PE has at the depth of its core maximum (mean) velocities of about 0.2\n\nm.s?1, while the observed eddy has maximum velocities of about 0.4 - 0.5 m.s?1. In spite\n\nof the small differences, the gereral agreement on the mean profile allows us to investigate\n\n\n\n63\n\nthe variability of the synthetic moooring velocity.\n\nFigure 3.21: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for PBM1 synthetic mooring.\n\nPositive values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeastward) flow.\n\nFigure 3.22: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for PBM2 synthetic mooring.\n\nPositive values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeastward) flow.\n\n\n\n64\n\nAn EOF analysis of the model-moored velocity time-series reveals three statisti-\n\ncally significant modes at both PBM1 (Figure 3.23) and PBM2 (Figure 3.24). The vertical\n\nstructure of the EOFs are very similar between both moorings. The vertical structure of\n\nthe first EOF (Figures 3.25 and 3.26) has maximum amplitude at the surface, monoton-\n\nically decreasing until about 200 m, when it reaches zero and aproximately maintains\n\nthis value throughout the rest of the water column. This structure is the same for both\n\nsynthetic moorings; for the synthetic PBM1 it explains 53 % of the time-series, and for\n\nsynthetic mooring PBM2, it explains 49 %.\n\nFigure 3.23: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the synthetic\n\nPBM1 and from a random time-series.

It has greater amplitude\n\nbetween 100 m and 400-500 m depth, with maximum velocities at about 200 m, which\n\n\n\n65\n\nclosely coincides with the depth of the modeled PE maximum velocities. This second\n\nEOF explains 28% and 27% of the variance of the series for the synthetic moorings PBM1\n\nand PBM2, respectively.\n\nFigure 3.24: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the synthetic\n\nPBM2 and from a random time-series.

The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the\n\nmean.\n\nThe comparison between the statistical modes of the velocity time series from\n\nthe observed and synthetic moorings reveals high correspondence between the first (sec-\n\nond) EOF of the observed moorings and the second (first) EOF of the synthetic ones.\n\nThe first EOF of the observed moorings, as previously stated, is associated with Rossby\n\nWaves propagating westward in the Equatorial Atlantic. The main period found for the\n\nfirst EOF for the observed moorings (25-35 days) is also found on the amplitude time\n\nseries for the second EOF of the synthetic moorings, which strongly suggests that they\n\nare associated with the same process. The second EOF of the observed moorings is re-\n\n\n\n66\n\nlated to upper-ocean processes, envolving the Ekman layer and the seasonal variability of\n\nthe trade winds over the Tropical Atlantic. We believe that the first EOF from the model\n\noutputs is associated with this process, and probably has higher explained variance due\n\nto the time-limited observed mooring data which prevented from resolving the seasonal\n\ncycle in a 8-month or one-year long time series.\n\nFigure 3.25: Vertical structure of the first EOF for synthetic mooring PBM1.\n\nWe also analyze the model results for lower-frequency variability. Figure 3.29\n\nshows an annual and a semiannual wave fit on the amplitude time-series of the two EOFs\n\nfor the synthetic mooring PBM1. The amplitude time series of the first EOF presents a\n\nlarger annual signal than the second mode, which indicates that the first mode from the\n\nsynthetic moorings is indeed related to upper ocean processes and therefore subject to\n\nthe annual signal of the trade winds in the Atlantic. The same behavior is seen on the\n\namplitude time series for synthetic mooring PBM2.\n\n\n\n67\n\nFigure 3.26: Vertical structure of the first EOF for synthetic mooring PBM2.\n\nFigure 3.27: Vertical structure of the second EOF for synthetic mooring PBM1.\n\n\n\n68\n\nFigure 3.28: Vertical structure of the second EOF for synthetic mooring PBM2.\n\n\n\n69\n\nFigure 3.29: Fit of annual and semi-annual signals on the amplitude time series for the\n\nfirst (top panel) and second (bottom panel) EOF for synthetic mooring PBM1.\n\n\n\n70\n\n3.4 Discussion\n\nIn this chapter we were able to address the PE stationarity and variability through\n\nthe analysis of two (one 8-month long and another one-year long) time series of current\n\nmeter moorings. The PE appears clearly in the mean profile of mooring velocity, with\n\nan about 250 m vertical extent (60-264 m in PBM1 and 100-430 m in PBM2), strongly\n\nsuggesting that it is a permanent feature in the region. This is a subsurface frontal me-\n\nander, with the mean current speeds at the surface on the opposite direction of that of its\n\nnearshore lobe. The PE southeastward velocity core is attached to the coast, as shown\n\nin the previous chapter, and extends offshore at least up to 50-100 km. The PE\u2019s highest\n\nvelocities, on the mooring data, occur on the mooring line closer to the coast (PBM1), as\n\nwas suggested by the synoptical velocity sections shown in chapter 2.\n\nOnce the stationarity of the PE has been established, we turn to its temporal\n\nvariability. The PE presents mainly two modes of variability, both affecting its vertical\n\nextent. The first mode is associated with the variation of the depth of the lower boundary\n\nof the PE, while the second mode, explaining less variance, is related to the variation of\n\nthe upper limit of the eddy, and probably associated with upper-layer processes. In this\n\ndissertation, we focus on the first mode of variability.\n\nThis first mode of variability explains about 60% and 37 % of the variance of the\n\noriginal series for PBM1 and PBM2, respectively. It has maximum amplitude close to the\n\nlower limit of the PE, being associated with the increase/decrease of the vertical extent,\n\ndue to the variation on the depth of its lower boundary. Wavelet analysis of the EOF\n\namplitude time-series reveal that most of the energy of this first mode is concentrated in\n\nperiods of 25-35 days, with a modulation: the 25-day period is predominant during July-\n\nSeptember, while the 35-day period oscilation is prevalent during September-December.\n\nThe vertical profile of this mode of variability is dominated by the second baroclinic\n\nmode, with maximum amplitude concentrated on the lower half of the eddy.\n\nKnowing that there is a second-mode signal impinging variability on the PE, and\n\nwith the urge to understand which phenomenon could cause such variability, we turned\n\nto altimetry data. Using the technique of Polito and Liu (2003) we were able to detect\n\n34-day waves along a zonal section located at 4oS. The filtered altimetry data indicate\n\n\n\n71\n\nthat these waves are generated west of 15o W mostly during the month of June. They then\n\npropagate westward and reach the Potiguar Bight during August-September.\n\nIntraseasonal variability have been previously reported on the NBUC/cSEC and\n\nNBC system. At 4o N, Johns et al. (1998) found two distinct modes of variability in\n\ncurrent meter mooring data; a baroclinic deep-reaching 60-90 day mode and a surface\n\ntrapped, 25-40 day mode. The 25-40 day mode is most energetic in May-June, related to\n\nthe eddy shedding of the NBC retroflection. The 60-90 days mode, on the other hand, is\n\npresent year-round, and is associated with the propagation of eddies, having a wave-like\n\ncharacter. Further south, aproximately at the equator, Schott et al. (1993) found near-\n\nsurface currents dominated by ? 30-day periodicity, with maximum energy occurring in\n\nMay-July. At 11o S, Veleda et al. (2012) report oscilations with a 14-21 day period,\n\nrelated to the lagged correlation structure between meridional wind stress and alongshore\n\ncurrents, consistent with Coastal Trapped Wave theory.\n\nThe period of the oscilations reported by Johns et al. (1998) and Schott et al.\n\n(1993) match the periods we found in the Potiguar Bight, but the processes envolved\n\nare clearly different. The 25-40 day mode from Johns et al. (1998) is strongly surface\n\ntrapped, resembling the first baroclinic mode, as are the oscilations reported by Schott\n\net al. (1993). Even though the periods are similar, these oscilations are dynamically\n\ndifferent from the ones we identified in the Potiguar Bight.\n\nFrom the dispersion relation, the oscilations we report here have a second-mode\n\nRossby Wave behavior. This result does not disagree with the findings of Schott et al.\n\n(1993) and Johns et al. (1998), since they reported first-mode waves, instead of second-\n\nmode ones. After identifying the waves, we speculate their generation process.\n\nLumpkin and Garzoli (2005) study of drifter trajectories indicate that the maxi-\n\nmum speeds in the cSEC occur in mid-July. Considering the modulation of the variability\n\nmode we that found (with most energy in this frequency band during July-December),\n\nwe argue that these second-mode Rossby Waves are generated by barotropic instability in\n\nthe Equatorial Current System, as the Tropical Instability waves reported by Schott et al.\n\n(1993).\n\nAfter characterizing the intraseasonal variability, we turn to an analysis of the\n\n\n\n72\n\nlower-frequency signals in the HYCOM global model results. The HYCOM outputs\n\npresent neither significant annual nor interannual variability in the Potiguar Bight, as in-\n\ndicated by a number of studies on the NBUC (SCHOTT et al., 1998; JOHNS et al., 1990;\n\nJOHNS et al., 1998).\n\nIn this chapter we analyzed the variability of the PE through observational data,\n\nsatellite altimetry and global numerical model results. On the following chapter we ana-\n\nlyze the PE generation process within a process-study numerical model framework.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nDynamical Process Studies\n\nHere we address the issue of the dynamics of the PE in terms of numerical ex-\n\nperiments carried out using the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS). To develop\n\nthe initial fields for these simulations, we use the Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling\n\nSystem (FORMS) technique. Section 4.1 describes the development of Feature Models\n\nfor NBUC and DWBC. In section 4.2 we present the numerical experiments set up carried\n\nout to address a set of science questions related to the eddy phenomenon. In section 4.3\n\nwe discuss the calibration and sensitivity of the numerical model to the choice of numer-\n\nical parameters for establishing a realistic dynamic simulation. In section 4.4 we present\n\nthe results of the analysis of numerical simulations.\n\n4.1 Development of Feature Models\n\nFor the numerical experiments using ROMS, we applied the Feature-Oriented\n\nRegional Modeling System (FORMS) approach (GANGOPADHYAY et al., 1997; GAN-\n\nGOPADHYAY and ROBINSON, 2002; GANGOPADHYAY et al., 2003). This tech-\n\nnique consists of empirically and analytically creating Feature Models to develop initial\n\nand boundary conditions for primitive equation numerical simulations. We applied this\n\ntechnique in a feature-oriented process study approach, in which one is able to build a\n\nconceptual scenario to reproduce and study the feature(s) of interest.\n\nIn this approach, an analytical formulation is developed for the synoptic features\n\nof interest, based on information from previous studies and observations. This analyt-\n\n73\n\n\n\n74\n\nical formulation of the three-dimensional velocity and mass field (the Feature Model -\n\nFM) is then used as initial field for process study numerical experiments, enabling the\n\ninvestigation of the dynamical processes taking place.\n\nA main advantage of the feature-oriented process study approach is the possi-\n\nbility of filtering and/or enphasizing certain characteristics of the flow which, in spite of\n\nbeing realistic, may not be of fundamental importance for the process(es) of interest. For\n\nexample, if one is studying a process which is dominated by barotropic instability, Feature\n\nModel parameters can be tuned to accentuate only the barotropic component of currents,\n\neven though the currents have a strong baroclinic component. This way, only the variables\n\nwhich are believed to play a crucial role on the process of interest will play dominant role\n\nin the simulations and can be studied dinamically. It must be stressed that, even though\n\nsuch process study Feature Models do not necessarily contain all the observed charac-\n\nteristics in nature, the FM does need to be based on the observed features and validated\n\nagainst actual data.\n\nIn the Potiguar Bight, the Potiguar Eddy is a recirculation of the NBUC waters;\n\ntherefore, the first feature in the region that demands understanding is the NBUC. At\n\ndeeper levels, on the other hand, the main feature of the circulation is the DWBC and, in\n\nspite of the fact that the PE only extends up to 400 m depth, this current might also play\n\na role on the PE dynamics. The DWBC may influence the vertical shear to induce baro-\n\nclinic instability and thus influence the generation of the PE. Additionally, the cSEC flows\n\nwestward in the study domain to feed into the variability of these two dominant boundary\n\ncurrents in the region. With the knowledge of the main features that are present on the\n\nregion and might influence the PE, we address the following questions using the FORMS\n\ntechnique and dynamical studies using ROMS, through the process study approach:\n\n\u2022 Is the NBUC alone capable of generating the PE?\n\n\u2022 How important is the vertical shear for the generation of the PE?\n\nIn order to address these questions, we use the information that we have from\n\nobservations and past synthesis studies, of each of the main currents in the area, namely,\n\nthe NBUC, the DWBC, and the cSEC, to develop individual Feature Models. These\n\n\n\n75\n\nFeature Models are then used to set up the initial field for numerical simulations, and the\n\nresults help understanding the role of each feature on the PE dynamics.\n\n4.1.1 NBUC Feature Model Formulation\n\nThe NBUC FM is developed based on the observed data from ONEI (February -\n\nMarch, 2002) and ONEII (October - December, 2004) cruises, as well as information from\n\nprevious studies (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; SCHOTT et al., 2003; SCHOTT et al., 2005).\n\nWe select the maximum speed, core depth, transport, horizontal and vertical extent from\n\neach source in order to develop the Feature Model, following earlier FM developments of\n\nBC, NBC (CALADO et al., 2008; SOUTELINO et al., 2013). Table 4.1 shows the values\n\nof these variables for each study, as well as the ones used for the NBUC Feature Model\n\nitself.\n\nThe values of the maximum speed, core depth, and western and eastern width of\n\nthe current for the ONEI and ONEII cruises shown in Table 4.1 were estimated taking into\n\naccount only sections 1-5 of each cruise, instead of all sections. This was done in order\n\nto extract and preserve the characteristics of the NBUC before the influence of the cSEC,\n\ni. e., south of ? 4o S. This care was also taken for the estimated values for the studies of\n\nSilveira et al. (1994) and Schott et al. (2005). Caution was taken when considering the\n\ninformation from the study of Schott et al. (2003), since it is based on a mean meridional\n\nsection at 35oW, area in which the NBUC is under the strong influence of the cSEC.\n\n\n\n76\n\nTa\nbl\n\ne\n4.\n\n1:\nIn\n\nfo\nrm\n\nat\nio\n\nn\nfr\n\nom\nth\n\ne\nda\n\nta\nan\n\nd\nli\n\nte\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\nfo\nr\n\nth\ne\n\nN\nB\n\nU\nC\n\nF\nM\n\nfo\nrm\n\nul\nat\n\nio\nn.\n\nP\nar\n\nam\net\n\ner\nS\n\nil\nve\n\nir\na\n\net\nal\n\n.\n(1\n\n99\n4)\n\nS\nch\n\not\nte\n\nta\nl.\n\n(2\n00\n\n3)\nS\n\nch\not\n\nte\nta\n\nl.\n(2\n\n00\n5)\n\nO\nN\n\nE\nI\n\nO\nN\n\nE\nII\n\nN\nB\n\nU\nC\n\nF\nM\n\nT\nra\n\nns\npo\n\nrt\n23\n\n.7\nS\n\nv\n(0\n\n-1\n00\n\n0\nm\n\n10\n.5\n\no\nS\n\n)\n32\n\n.2\nS\n\nv\n35\n\no\nW\n\n25\n.4\n\u00b1\n\n7.\n4\n\nS\nv\n\n(0\n-1\n\n10\n0\n\nm\n11\n\no\nS\n\n)\n-\n\n-\n24\n\nS\nv\n\n19\n.9\n\nS\nv\n\n(0\n-1\n\n00\n0\n\nm\n5o\n\nS\n)\n\n26\n.5\n\u00b1\n\n3.\n7\n\nS\nv\n\n(0\n-1\n\n10\n0\n\nm\n5o\n\nS\n)\n\nM\nax\n\nim\num\n\nve\nlo\n\nci\nty\n\n0.\n5\n\nm\n.s\n?\n1\n\n(\n10\n\n.5\no\n\nS\n)\n\n0.\n6\n\nm\n.s\n?\n1\n\n35\no\n\nW\n0.\n\n7\nm\n\n.s\n?\n1\n\n11\no\n\nS\n1.\n\n2\nm\n\n.s\n?\n1\n\n1.\n2\n\nm\n.s\n?\n1\n\n0.\n76\n\n-\n0.\n\n84\nm\n\n.s\n?\n1\n\n0.\n9\n\nm\n.s\n?\n1\n\n5o\nS\n\nC\nor\n\ne\nde\n\npt\nh\n\n10\n0-\n\n20\n0\n\nm\n(\n\n11\no\n\nS\n-\n\n5o\nS\n\n)\n10\n\n0\nm\n\n35\no\n\nW\n25\n\n0\nm\n\n11\no\n\nS\n20\n\n0-\n10\n\n0\nm\n\n20\n0\n\n-\n10\n\n0\nm\n\n25\n0-\n\n13\n0\n\nm\n\n10\n0\n\nm\n5o\n\nS\n\nW\nes\n\nte\nrn\n\nw\nid\n\nth\n50\n\nkm\n50\n\nkm\n50\n\nkm\n?\n\n30\nkm\n\n?\n30\n\nkm\n50\n\nkm\n\nE\nas\n\nte\nrn\n\nW\nid\n\nth\n70\n\nkm\n10\n\n0\nkm\n\n10\n0\n\nkm\n?\n\n10\n0\n\nkm\n?\n\n10\n0\n\nkm\n50\n\nkm\n\nV\ner\n\nti\nca\n\nle\nxt\n\nen\nt\n\n0\n-\n\n10\n00\n\nm\n12\n\n00\nm\n\n0\n-\n\n11\n00\n\nm\n-\n\n-\n10\n\n00\nm\n\n\n\n77\n\nBased on the information from the data and previous studies, we developed an\n\nanalytical function that represents the along-stream velocity structure of the NBUC (Equa-\n\ntion 4.1). The orientation of the system is a natural coordinate frame of reference, in which\n\ns is the along-stream axis, n is the cross-stream axis, and z is the vertical axis.\n\n?(s,n,z) = ?max(s)exp\n[\n?\n(\n\n(n ? nc)2\n\n2?2n\n+\n\n(z ? zc(s))2\n\n2?2z\n\n)]\n(4.1)\n\nwhere:\n\n?(s,n,z) is the velocity of the current, which varies in the along-stream (s),\n\ncross-stream (n), and vertical (z) axes;\n\n?max(s) is the maximum velocity of the current;\n\nnc is the distance of the NBUC core from the coast;\n\nzc(s) is the linear function for the NBUC core lifting;\n\n?n/2 is the horizontal width of each side of the current:\n\nfor n &lt;nc (onshore part of the current): ?n/2 = 50 km;\n\nfor n > nc (offshore part of the current): ?n/2 = 50 km;\n\n?z/2 represents the upward/downward vertical extent of the current from the\n\ncore:\n\nfor z > zc: ?z/2 = 100 m;\n\nfor z &lt;zc: ?z/2 = 360 m;\n\nAs previously stated, the formulation for the NBUC FM was based on informa-\n\ntion from the literature, as well as from ONEI and ONEII cruises. On Figures 4.1 and 4.2,\n\npart of the analysis of the cruise data in order to develop the FM analytical formulation is\n\nexemplified. A simple best-fit is done on the data, to find parameters that matched with\n\nrelevant information from the literature and cruises. Based on the vessel-mounted ADCP\n\ndata from ONEII cruise, we calculated statistical fit to the curves, obtaining the values\n\nof the parameters for the analytical function in Equation 4.1, to be used as shape of the\n\nNBUC, vertically as well as horizontally.\n\n\n\n78\n\nFigure 4.1: Feature Model Characteristics based on ONEI measurements. Upper panel:\n\ncross section velocity at section 6 of ONEI (Feb-Mar, 2002). Middle panel: observed\n\n(solid line) and FM (dashed line) velocity profile at the location indicated by the vertical\n\nblack line on the upper panel. Lower panel: observed (solid line) and FM (dashed line)\n\nhorizontal velocity distribution at the depth indicated by the horizontal black line on the\n\nupper panel. Positive velocities indicate northward flow.\n\nAccording to the information from the literature and from ONEI and ONEII\n\ncruises, we set the parameters for the depth of the NBUC core (zc) to be 250 m at the\n\nsouthern (about 10oS), and shoal up to 130 m at the northern boundary of the domain.\n\nAlso, the maximum velocity of the NBUC (?(s,n,z)) was set at about 0.8 m.s?1, in order\n\nto yield a realistic transport of about 24.5 Sv. The analytical function used for the NBUC\n\nFM was applied over various sections along the brazilian coast, as shown in Figure 4.3.\n\nAs a result of the solution of the analytical velocity formulation for each transect,\n\nwe have a current flowing along the coast, with the aforementioned characteristics which\n\nare specific to the NBUC. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 present the NBUC FM velocity through the\n\nsouthern and northern parts of the domain, respectively. The first characteristic to notice\n\nis the subsurface character of the NBUC core throughout the domain. Also, the modeled\n\nNBUC has a ? 1000 m vertical extent (?z) on the southern portion of the domain; as\n\nthe current flows northward, due to the shoaling of its core, its vertical extent is linearly\n\n\n\n79\n\nreduced, reaching a minimum of about 850 m. The horizontal width (?n/2) used was\n\nconstant over the domain, and the same for the western and eastern sides of the current.\n\nThis fixed value was adopted even though realisticaly the width of the current is smaller\n\non the onshore than on the offshore portion and varies along the currents\u2019 path due to\n\ncontributions from different currents (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). This choice was based on\n\ntwo assumptions: (i) the difference of horizontal width between the onshore and offshore\n\nportions of the NBUC are not fundamental for the generation and maintenance of the PE,\n\nand (ii) the along-stream variation of the width of the current is due to contributions from\n\nother currents. Considering that in this work we develop an individual Feature Model for\n\neach current, it would be undesirable to insert on the NBUC FM characteristics which\n\nare due to the existence of other currents. The NBUC transport increases slightly in the\n\nalong-stream direction, from ? 24.4 Sv at 11oS to ? 25 Sv at 2oS.\n\nFigure 4.2: Feature Model Characteristics based on ONEII measurements.

On this process, the thermal wind relation (Equation 4.2)\n\nfo\n?v\n\n?z\n= ?\n\ng\n\n??\n\n??\n\n?n\n, (4.2)\n\nwhere:\n\nfo is the Coriolis parameter;\n\n?? is the reference density;\n\n? is the density.\n\nis integrated with respect to x to find density (Equation 4.3):\n\n?(s,n) = ?(0,z) ?\nfo??\n\ng\n\n?

(2013) (Equation 4.4) to calculate the temperature field:\n\nT(s,n) =\n\n??\n??\n\n+ 1 + ??So(z)\n\n??\n(4.4)\n\nwhere:\n\nT(s,n) is the temperature;\n\n?? is the mean haline contraction coefficient;\n\nSo(z) is a mean salinity profile computed from climatology;\n\n?? is the mean thermal expansion coefficient.\n\n\n\n82\n\nFigure 4.5: Velocity section 44 (northernmost) of the NBUC FM.\n\nThe near-equatorial salinity field has complications that were not captured by\n\nthe feature model formulation; therefore, we use the climatological salinity field from\n\nWOA (2013). This process is described in detail in Section 4.3. After the FM velocity\n\nand temperature fields were developed, they were gridded to the domain (40oW-26oW,\n\n11oS-1oS) by repeating the last (easternmost) values of temperature and velocity of each\n\nthe FM transects up to the eastern edge of the domain. This procedure was not necessary\n\nfor the salinity field, since the WOA salinity field spans the entire domain.\n\n\n\n83\n\nThe gridded FM temperature and salinity fields for the surface and 200 m are\n\nshown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. The salinity field shows a larger spatial vari-\n\nability at both levels, since it is itself the WOA(2013) salinity field. The temperature field,\n\non the other hand, has much less structures, with lower values confined close to the coast.\n\n4.1.2 DWBC Feature Model Formulation\n\nThe DWBC FM was developed like that of the NBUC FM, but all the parameter-\n\nrelated information (Table 4.2) was derived from previous studies only. That was neces-\n\nsary because the depth reach of the ADCP during ONEI and ONEII was much shallower\n\nthan the upper layer of the DWBC (? 1200 m).\n\nTable 4.2: Information from the literature for the DWBC FM formulation.\n\nParameter Schott et al.

Also, as the DWBC\n\ncrosses the equator, its path is not very clear, as it may follow an eastward path as well\n\nas southward. Besides, some water mass transformations take place close to the equator.\n\nPrimarily we used the two consecutive studies by Schott et al. (2003) and Schott et\n\nal. (2005) for DWBC FM development. Note that Schott et al. (2003) describes the\n\nDWBC in a mean sense at 35oW and Schott et al. (2005) describe a data-based synoptic\n\ncharacterization of the DWBC at 5oS and 11oS. For implementing the synoptic DWBC\n\nFM, we thus chose Schott et al. (2005) mainly for extrating the parameters. See Figure\n\n4.10 for observed depictions of DWBC from Schott et al. (2005).\n\n\n\n84\n\nThe adopted DWBC formulation is very similar to the NBUC formulation, with\n\nthe main difference that the core depth does not vary along the path of the current. The\n\nformulation is the following (Equation 4.5):\n\n?(s,n,z) = ?max(s)exp\n[\n?\n(\n\n(n ? nc)2\n\n2?2n\n+\n\n(z ? zc(s))2\n\n2?2z\n\n)]\n, (4.5)\n\nwhere ?max(s) is the maximum velocity of the current; nc is the distance of the\n\nDWBC core from the coast; zc is the core depth of the DWBC; ?2n represents the horizontal\n\nwidth on either side of the current at the depth of the core:\n\nfor n &lt;nc (onshore part of the current): ?x/2 = 40 km,\n\nfor n > nc (offshore part of the current): ?x/2 = 75 km;\n\nand ?z represents the vertical width of the current from the core, which differs on\n\nthe upper and lower part of the current:\n\nfor z > zc: ?z/2 = 500 m\n\nfor z &lt;zc: ?z/2 = 800 m\n\nBased on the information from the literature (Schott et al. (2003) and Schott et\n\nal. (2005)), the NBUC FM was chosen to have a 0.25 m.s?1 core (?max) at 2000 m depth\n\n(zc), extending from 1200 to 3500 m and yielding a transport of about 20 Sv (Table 4.2).\n\nAs done for the NBUC FM, the DWBC FM velocity formulation was solved for various\n\nsections along the coast, the same ones used for the NBUC (Figure 4.3). Also, considering\n\nthat the PE is a feature within the depth range of the NBUC, we apply the DWBC together\n\nwith the NBUC FM, since without the NBUC there would be no possibility of the PE to\n\nexist. To apply both FMs, we simply sum the NBUC FM and the DWBC FM.\n\nThe southernmost and northernmost sections of the combination of the DWBC\n\nand NBUC FMs (Figures 4.8 and 4.9, respectively), show the DWBC further offshore\n\nfrom the coast than the NBUC. Since the velocity and the vertical extent of the DWBC do\n\nnot change along the current\u2019s path, the transport of the DWBC is constant througout the\n\ndomain. The core is vertically located at 2000 m and the symetry of the current is visible\n\nthrough the fixed horizontal width, which is the same for both sides of the current.\n\nUnfortunatly, the DWBC FM could not be validated against the ONEI or ONEII\n\ndata, due to the depth reach of the ADCP equipment. Therefore, in Figure 4.10 we present\n\n\n\n85\n\nSchott et al. (2005)\u2019s sections at 5o S and 11o S, to compare to the sections of our NBUC\n\nFM.\n\nThe comparison between the DWBC FM (Figures 4.8 and 4.9) and the mean\n\nobserved DWBC (Figure 4.10) demonstrates that the parameters used for the development\n\nof the Feature Model were valid. The core velocity, 0.25 m.s?1, is the same for the FM\n\nand the observations; the depth of the core, at approximately 2000 m depth, is coincident\n\nas well. The width of the current, somewhat over 100 km, is also similar, yielding a\n\nsimilar transport for the feature model and the observed mean section at 5 oS. The upper\n\nand lower limits of the current, ? 1200 m and ? 3500 m, also match between model and\n\nobservations.\n\nAs was done for the NBUC FM, the temperature was calculated through the\n\ninversion of the thermal wind relation (Equation 4.2), also with a mean T-S profile from\n\nthe WOA (2013) climatology. Then the velocity and temperature fields were gridded to\n\nthe domain (40oW-26oW, 11oS-1oS) by repeating the last (easternmost) values of each\n\nof the FM transects up to the eastern edge of the domain. For the salinity field, the\n\nWOA (2013) salinity field, which spanned the entire domain, was used. Therefore, just\n\ninterpolation to the bathymetry values was performed on the salinity values.\n\n\n\n86\n\nFigure 4.6: FM-derived potential temperature field of the NBUC FM for the entire do-\n\nmain at the surface (top panel) and 200 m (bottom panel).

Each\n\nquestion was addressed with a particular combination of NBUC-DWBC feature model\n\ndiscussed in the previous section. We describe these in detail below.\n\nQuestion 1: Can the NBUC alone generate the PE?\n\nTo address this question, we set up an experiment with an initial field com-\n\nposed by just the NBUC FM, with the topography truncated at 1500 m and no islands\n\nor seamounts offshore the continental slope, as well as no wind stress. The chosen do-\n\nmain is between 10o S and 1o S; 27o W and 40o W, with a 5-km horizontal spaced grid\n\nand 30 sigma layers vertical resolution. In this set-up, the flow coming in from the south\n\ncorresponds to 24.77 Sv and the flow going out on the western boundary is 25.13 Sv,\n\nyielding an imbalance of 0.36 Sv (Figure 4.11). The difference in transport results from\n\nthe increase in the NBUC core velocity.\n\nFigure 4.11: Transport values imposed on the edges of the domain for Experiment # 1.\n\nThe boundary conditions were clamped on the southern and western boundaries\n\n(where there are inflow and outflow, respectively, on the initial field) and nudging on the\n\neastern and northern boundaries. At these boundaries there is no inflow or outflow on the\n\n\n\n92\n\ninitial field, so the nudging was enforced in order to maintain this condition throughout\n\nthe run. A 6-point sponge layer was imposed, with nudging time scales of 6 days 6 points\n\naway from the boundary, and 1 day at the boundary itself. This run was also set up with a\n\nfree-slip condition, being called Experiment # 1. Figure 4.11\n\nQuestion 2: How important is the vertical shear on the generation of the\n\nPE?\n\nTo address this question, we set up an experiment with an initial field built with\n\nthe composition of the NBUC and DWBC FMs. The horizontal limits of the domain\n\nand its horizontal resolution were the same as in Experiment # 1, but on the vertical, the\n\ndomain extended from the surface down to 5500 m, with computations performed in 50\n\nsigma layers. The boundary conditions enforced were the same as in Experiment # 1, i. e.,\n\nclamped on the southern and western boundaries, and nudging on the eastern and northern\n\nboundaries. This run was also set up with a free-slip condition and no wind stress, and\n\nwas called Experiment # 2. The schematics for the mass balance for this experiment\n\nis shown on Figure 4.12, demonstrating a total imbalance of about 0.85 Sv, which we\n\nconsider to be small enough not to cause mass-imbalance problems.\n\nFigure 4.12: Transport values imposed on the edges of the domain for Experiment # 2.\n\n\n\n93\n\nThese experiments are carried out with the Regional Ocean Modelling System\n\n(ROMS) (SHCHEPETKIN and MCWILLIAMS, 2005), which is a primitive- equation\n\nnumerical model developed from the S-Coordinate Rutgers University Model. ROMS\n\nhas stretched coordinates in the vertical and curvilinear coordinates on the horizontal, and\n\nuses an Arakawa-C grid. The domain, as cited on the previous sections, extended between\n\n10o S and 1o S; 27o W and 40o W, with different discretizations on the vertical - 30 sigma\n\nlevels for Experiments #1 and 50 for Experiment # 2. For Experiment # 1 the batimetry\n\nwas smoothed until the maximum topographic gradient was 0.2, for Experiment #2, we\n\nuse a 0.15 gradient.\n\n4.3 Calibration of Numerical Model and Sensitivity\n\nstudies for long-term simulations\n\nGenerally, in a FORMS approach for synoptic ocean prediction, there are three\n\ndistinct steps; (i) Validation, which is the physical validation of occurence and mainte-\n\nnance of realistic size and shape of the reproduced features; (ii) Calibration, which would\n\nbe the changing and tuning parameter values to achieve validation, and (iii) Verification,\n\nwhich is realistically reproducing past observed events to verify that the prediction sys-\n\ntem has skill of forecasting as evidenced from hindcasts. In a process-study approach, the\n\n\u201dverification\u201d step is replaced by \u201dinvestigation\u201d, over which we analyze the processes\n\nenvolved on the features of interest.\n\nIn the previous sections we describe the development of the Feature Model and\n\ncompare it with available data/information, thus completing step (i). After this step, we\n\nturn to the calibration phase, in which we develop a calibrated system to its dynamical\n\nequilibrium for investigating processes of interest with dynamical realizations. In step\n\n(ii), we configured a series of numerical simulations with the developed Feature Models,\n\nanalyzing the requirements and the changes necessary for the dynamical equilibrium to be\n\nreached. In this sense, Tables 4.3 and 4.4 list all the sensitivity experiments that were car-\n\nried out before the working set-up was achieved, with the boundary and initial conditions\n\nthat are most

developing the initial fields for the simulations, we considered a series of\n\nissues, including mainly: (a) salinity feature model derivation based on a single linear\n\nt-s relationship; (b) salinity feature model with two linear t-s relationships (one for the\n\nshelf and another for the deep ocean); (c) addition of a bottom boundary layer (BBL);\n\n(d) free-slip vs. no-slip; (e) use of salinity climatology from WOA 2009; (f) use of salin-\n\nity climatology from WOA 2013; (g) maximum bottom slope allowed, and finally (h)\n\nseamounts vs. no-seamounts.\n\nWe found that both (a) and (b) resulted in multiple issues with generation of high-\n\nsalinity regions and unrealistic salinities near the bottom. The enforced bottom boundary\n\nlayer (with an exponential decay to zero velocity at the bottom from a specified depth)\n\nhelped for a little while; but not for the long-term. We then used free-slip boundary con-\n\ndition, and no bottom boundary layer. The use of WOA2013 climatology finally helped\n\nthe evolution of salinity near the western boundary (high-current) regions. However, at\n\nthis time, we had issues with anomalous salinity concentrations around seamounts. So,\n\nin the final simulation for the 1500 m run (Experiment #1), the WOA 2013 salinity field\n\nis used in a model domain without any seamounts. This simulation was stable and repet-\n\nitive in its performance for over 500 days. For the Experiment # 2, the seamounts were\n\nmaintained, but the maximum model bathymetric slope alowed was reduced from 0.25 to\n\n0.15. Similar long-term runs were carried out in parallel with the 5500 m set up and all\n\nof the sensitivity studies are listed in Table 4.4.\n\n4.4 Model results\n\nTwo experiments were conducted, with distinct vertical domain (H = 1500 m\n\nand H = 5500 m ) and small differences on the set-up, as indicated in section 4.2. On\n\nthe following sections we describe the results of the model experiments # 1 and # 2 and\n\ncompare them with information from observed data, focusing on the Potiguar Bight area.\n\n\n\n97\n\n4.4.1 Experiment # 1 (NBUC only, H = 1500 m)\n\nThe kinetic energy in Experiment # 1 stabilized after 100 days (Figure 4.13).\n\nThis experiment was run for about 550 days, a time span within which the model seemed\n\nto have reached dynamical equilibrium.\n\nFigure 4.13: Time evolution of domain-averaged kinetic energy for Experiment # 1. Note\n\nthat the dynamical equilibrium of the simulation is reached after about 100 days.\n\nIn this experiment, the surface current field remained highly variable throughout\n\nthe simulation, with the flow dominated by quasi-stationary and propagating eddies along\n\nthe coast, specially on the northern part of the domain. A representative picture of the\n\nsurface velocity field after the kinetic energy stabilization is given on Figure 4.14.\n\nAt a depth of 200 m, before the kinetic energy stabilization, the NBUC meanders\n\nclose to the northeast tip of South America, generates dipoles in the Potiguar Basin area,\n\nand sheds eddies that move to the northwestern part of the domain, as shown on the\n\nsequence presented on Figure 4.15. Around day 100, the PE becomes a stationary eddy\n\nconfined on the Potiguar Basin, and remains that way for the remainder of the run. The\n\nprocess of eddy generation, which happened before the onset of dynamical equilibrium\n\nwas reached, can be followed in the 200 m horizontal velocity and temperature field in\n\n\n\n98\n\nFigure 4.15 and on cross-eddy velocity and temperature sections in Figures 4.16 and 4.17,\n\nrespectively, and is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFigure 4.14: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at the surface for Experiment #\n\n1.\n\nIn the beginning of the run, during day one, the velocity field at 200 m shows the\n\nNBUC very similar to that of the initial field developed based on the Feature Model; no\n\neddy is seen on the Potiguar Bight. On the following days, there are eddies formed in the\n\nregion as part of a dipole structure with an anticyclone on the nearshore side of the current\n\nand a cyclone on the offshore side. The vertical velocity sections depict the perturbation\n\non the velocity field with depth by the dipole structure as the eddy formation evolves. The\n\ntemperature sections also show the perturbation on the isotherms caused by the instability\n\nof the field. On day 101 the field reaches a stable configuration, with the NBUC flowing\n\nnorthwestward along the coast and the stationary PE is confined to the Potiguar Bight.\n\nAfter this stable configuration is reached, the flow field does not change significantly over\n\nthe integration period (up to day 500). Also, it should be stressed that the time required\n\nfor the PE to become stationary coincides with the time required for the domain-averaged\n\n\n\n99\n\nkinetic energy to stabilize (Figure 4.13).\n\nFigure 4.15: Evolution of the temperature and velocity fields at 200 m during Experiment\n\n# 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71 (lower\n\nleft), and 101 (lower right).\n\n\n\n100\n\nFigure 4.16: Evolution of the velocity field over a cross-eddy section during Experiment\n\n# 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71\n\n(lower left), and 101 (lower right).\n\nAs suggested by the mean cross-eddy section after the stabilization of the run\n\n(Figure 4.18), the modeled PE seems to have a very weak surface signature and a deep-\n\nreaching structure. However, the sole analysis of the mean cross-eddy velocity section\n\nto infer the vertical extent of the eddy can be misleading. The horizontal temperature\n\nand velocity fields for day 101 for 500, 900 and 1000 m (Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21,\n\nrespectively), show that, even though there is a deep southeastward flow attached to the\n\ncontinental slope in the Potiguar Bight, this flow does not necessarily correspond to a part\n\nof the eddy. The PE is clearly seen on the 500 m field (Figure 4.19), but on the 900 m and\n\n\n\n101\n\n1000 m there is no eddy structure on the Potiguar Bight. The southeastward velocities are\n\ncaused by a southward-flowing current along the coast, probably generated by the bathy-\n\nmetric constraints (1500 m maximum depth) imposed for this run. Therefore, caution\n\nmust be exercized when delimiting the part of the water column over the influence of the\n\neddy. Here, after analyzing horizontal velocity fields, we delimit the eddy as between 50\n\nand 750 m for transport calculation.\n\nFigure 4.17: Evolution of the temperature field over a cross-eddy section during Exper-\n\niment # 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right),\n\n71 (lower left), and 101 (lower right).\n\nThe flow at 500 m presented on Figure 4.19 is representative of the flow at this\n\ndepth after the run reaches stabilization. The field is similar to the 200 m field, with\n\n\n\n102\n\nthe Potiguar eddy clearly formed. On 1000 m (Figure 4.21), however, no PE is seen\n\nand a continuous southward current is identified along the coast, which is probably due\n\nto the continuity requirement from the bathymetric constraints imposed for this run, as\n\npreviously stated. The mean modeled NBUC after the run reached dynamical equilibrium\n\nhas a transport of 27 Sv, comparable to the values indicated by Silveira et al. (1994);\n\nSchott et al. (2002), for example. Its path is also realistic, as well as its core depth and\n\nwidth.\n\nFigure 4.18: Mean cros-section for Experiment # 1, over days 201-360.\n\nIn Experiment # 1 we investigate whether or not the NBUC alone would be\n\ncapable of generating the Potiguar Eddy. As a result of our analysis we reach the conclu-\n\nsion that the PE formation process does not require the presence of the DWBC, since its\n\ngeneration is observed in this NBUC-only configuration. On Figure 4.22 we analyze the\n\nformation of the PE at 200 m in the relative vorticity field. Figure 4.23 shows a cross-eddy\n\nrelative vorticity profile at 200 m during the same days as Figure 4.22.\n\n\n\n103\n\nFigure 4.19: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at 500 m for Experiment # 1.\n\nThe shear of the flow field on the Potiguar Bight during the process of eddy\n\nformation is revealed in the horizontal relative vorticity field at 200 m (Figure 4.22). On\n\nday 1, only the patches of positive and negative relative vorticity associated with the\n\nNBUC are seen in the Potiguar Bight, following the topographic contours. On Figure\n\n4.23 this is more evident, with the positive relative vorticity on the nearshore side of the\n\ncurrent, the sign change (representing the location of the NBUC core), and the negative\n\nrelative vorticity on the offshore side of the current.\n\nOn day 7 the field is already disturbed, as the NBUC starts to meander and flow\n\nfurther away from the coast. During days 15, 51 and 71 the NBUC does not follow\n\nthe topography, flowing without much meandering further from the coast. The relative\n\nvorticity horizontal distribution close to the coast seems to be in a transient state, without\n\na clear pattern close to the shore. On the cross-eddy profile, the slow development of a\n\npatch of negative relative vorticity close to the coast is more evident.\n\n\n\n104\n\nFigure 4.20: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at 900 m for Experiment # 1.\n\nFinally, on day 101, a steady state is reached, with the positive and negative\n\npatches representing the positive and negative relative vorticity areas on either side of the\n\nNBUC core, and a large area of positive relative vorticity over the Potiguar Bight on the\n\nhorizontal distribution. On the cross-eddy profile (Figure 4.23, lower right panel), the\n\nsignature of the now formed PE is seen as the profile presents a (i) negative (cyclonic)\n\nrelative vorticity near the coast, followed by (ii) positive (anticyclonic) relative vorticity\n\nfurther offshore, which is followed by (iii) another patch of negative (cyclonic) relative\n\nvorticity. (i) represents the nearshore portion of the nearshore lobe of the PE, with (east-\n\nward) velocity increasing northward. After the peak velocities of the nearshore lobe of the\n\nPE are reached, the relative vorticity changes sign and becomes positive, (ii) associated\n\nwith the (westward) velocity increase in the northern direction. At the location of the core\n\nof the NBUC, the relative vorticity changes sign again (iii), due to the (westward) velocity\n\ndecrease in the northern direction.\n\n\n\n105\n\nFigure 4.21: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at 1000 m for Experiment # 1.\n\n\n\n106\n\nFigure 4.22: Evolution of the relative vorticity field at 200 m during Experiment # 1\n\nduring days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71 (lower\n\nleft), and 101 (lower right).\n\n\n\n107\n\nFigure 4.23: Evolution of the relative vorticity field at 200 m during Experiment # 1\n\nduring days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71 (lower\n\nleft), and 101 (lower right).\n\n\n\n108\n\n4.4.2 Experiment # 2 (NBUC + DWBC, H = 5500 m)\n\nExperiment # 2 was run for 420 days, which corresponds to about 320 days\n\nafter the stabilization of the domain-averaged kinetic energy, around day 100 ( Figure\n\n4.24). Note that both Experiments # 1 and #2 took about 100 days to reach dynamical\n\nequilibrium and this is the same time-period for the PE to be established.\n\nFigure 4.24: Time evolution of domain-averaged eddy kinetic energy for Experiment #\n\n2.\n\nFor this experiment, as done for Experiment # 1, we explain in detail the gener-\n\nation of the modeled PE based on the 200 m horizontal velocity and temperature fields\n\n(Figure 4.25), cross-eddy velocity sections (Figure 4.26) and cross-eddy temperature sec-\n\ntions (Figure 4.27) over the first days of the simulation.\n\nOn day 1, the field is very similar to the initial field, since the flow has not yet\n\nhad time to adjust. As days go by, the NBUC starts to flow further from the coast on the\n\nPotiguar Bight area, and on day 13 an eddy is formed in the region. However, it seems\n\nthat the current takes a few more days to adjust to the bathymetry (Potiguar Bight), and\n\ntherefore the nearshore eddy velocities oscillate in a strengthening and weakening cycle,\n\nuntil reaching an equilibrium around day 121.\n\n\n\n109\n\nFigure 4.25: Evolution of the temperature and velocity fields at 200 m during Experiment\n\n# 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25 (lower\n\nleft), and 121 (lower right).\n\n\n\n110\n\nFigure 4.26: Evolution of the velocity field over a cross-eddy section during Experiment\n\n# 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25\n\n(lower left), and 121 (lower right).\n\n\n\n111\n\nAfter the dynamical equilibrium is reached, the modeled NBUC offshore of the\n\nPotiguar Bight (Figure 4.28) presents realistic maximum velocities, but with a vertical\n\nextent, from the surface to 3000 m, larger than indicated by observational studies. This\n\nlarger vertical extent yields a transport of of about 50 Sv, which is higher than most\n\nestimates in the literature. The DWBC, on the other hand, presents realistic velocities\n\nand transport, with a vertical extent matching the estimates from previous studies such as\n\nSchott et al. (2002).\n\nThe mean PE, after stabilization of the kinetic energy (Figure 4.28), has a core\n\nof 0.3 m.s?1 at 250 m, which is in agreement with the observations presented in chapters\n\n2 and 3 . It extends from 50 to 550 m, with major and minor axes measuring 300 km and\n\n140 km, respectively, which are also realistic according to the observations presented in\n\nthe previous chapters.\n\nOn the first few days of the run, a retroflection on the first 500 m of the water\n\ncolumn is developed. This retroflection remains present during the entire run, between the\n\nsurface and 500 m depth, as shown in Figure 4.30. At the surface, besides the retroflec-\n\ntion, the signature of the NBUC can be seen, northward of 6oS. At 500 m, the flow is very\n\nsimilar to the 200 m flow shown in Figure 4.25; the NBUC following its path northward\n\nalong the coast, with a retroflection on the northwest corner of the domain, after which\n\nthe current follows an eastward path paralel to the northern boundary. The flow after the\n\nretroflection occasionally is disturbed by wave-like signals, which can generate recircula-\n\ntions, as seen on Figure 4.30, lower panel and reported on observational data by Stramma\n\net al. (2005).\n\nThe flow field at 1000 m (Figure 4.31, top panel) shows the NBUC flowing\n\nnorthward, with maximum velocities of about 0.2 m.s?1. At the northwest corner, this\n\ncurrent turns eastward and seems to permanently recirculate back into the NBUC at about\n\n34 oW. On the rest of the domain there are no significant currents. At 2000 m (Figure 4.31,\n\nbottom panel), the DWBC signature is present, with a realistic path southward, velocity\n\nmagnitudes and transport, in agreement with previous observational studies in the area (e.\n\ng., Schott et al. (2002)).\n\n\n\n112\n\nFigure 4.27: Evolution of the temperature field over a cross-eddy section during Experi-\n\nment # 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 ( middle left), 21 (middle right),\n\n25 (lower left), and 121 (lower right).\n\nThe relevance of the vertical shear on the PE generation and maintenance is\n\ninvestigated in this experiment. The analysis of Experiment # 1 results show that the PE\n\ngeneration is independent of the presence of the DWBC. Now, we compare the results\n\nfrom both experiments to assess the influence of the vertical shear induced by the DWBC\n\non the generation of the eddy.\n\n\n\n113\n\nFigure 4.28: Mean cros-section for Experiment # 2, over days 101-361.\n\nWe have seen from the detailed description of the eddy generation process in\n\nboth simulations that the mechanism for the eddy formation differ between the Experi-\n\nments. The horizontal evolution of the relative vorticity at 200 m (Figure 4.32) and the\n\ncross-eddy relative vorticity profile at the same depth (Figure 4.33) during the first days\n\nof Experiment # 2 show the process of generation of the PE through a relative vorticity\n\nperspective. As during Experiment # 1, on the first day of the run there is just the rel-\n\native vorticity gradient associated with the NBUC itself, with the positive patch closest\n\nto the coast and the negative one, further away. The cross-eddy relative vorticity shows\n\nthe same bahavior; a positive patch near the coast, a sign inversion at the location of the\n\nNBUC core, and a negative patch of relative vorticity further offshore. During the fol-\n\nlowing few days, the field is disturbed, but not in the same way as in Experiment # 1;\n\nno eddy-pinching is observed. The PE is formed by itself, without a dipole structure, on\n\nthe Potiguar Bight, and no northwest propagation is seen. Once the eddy is formed, this\n\nfeature becomes stationary in the area, with a cross-eddy relative vorticity profile similar\n\nto that of Experiment # 1: a negative region close to the coast, representing the portion\n\n\n\n114\n\nFigure 4.29: Mean cros-section for Experiment # 2, over days 101-361 (Same as Figure\n\n4.28, different axis).\n\nclosest to the shore of the nearshore PE lobe; a positive relative vorticity region due to the\n\nincrease in (westward) velocities within the eddy, and, at the location of the NBUC core,\n\na sign inversion, followed by a negative patch associated with the decreasing (westward)\n\nvelocities in the northern direction.\n\n\n\n115\n\nFigure 4.30: Velocity and temperature fields on day 121 at 1 m (top panel) and 500 m\n\n(bottom panel) for Experiment # 2.\n\n\n\n116\n\nFigure 4.31: Velocity and temperature fields on day 121 at 1000 m (top panel) and 2000\n\nm (bottom panel) for Experiment # 2.\n\n\n\n117\n\nFigure 4.32: Evolution of the relative vorticity field at 200 m during Experiment # 2\n\nduring days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25 (lower\n\nleft), and 121 (lower right).\n\n\n\n118\n\nFigure 4.33: Evolution of the relative vorticity field at 200 m during Experiment # 2\n\nduring days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25 (lower\n\nleft), and 121 (lower right).\n\n\n\n119\n\n4.5 Discussion\n\nThe Feature Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS) (GANGOPADHYAY\n\nand ROBINSON, 2002) is a useful tool that can be applied in a forecasting framework as\n\nwell as in a process-study aproach. In this dissertation, we apply this methodology with\n\nthe latter approach, in a similar fashion as Calado et al. (2008); Soutelino et al. (2013).\n\nWe develop NBUC and DWBC Feature Models based on observational data and informa-\n\ntion from the scientific literature in order to develop an initial field as realistic as possible\n\nfor our domain while filtering certain characteristics of the flow which, in spite of being\n\nrealistic, are not of fundamental importance for the process(es) of interest. After that, we\n\nconducted experiments using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), similarly\n\nto Soutelino et al. (2013).\n\nHere we use the process-study approach to investigate the generation and main-\n\ntenance of a frontal meander of the North Brazil Undercurrent off the northeastern tip of\n\nSouth America. The initial field for the numerical experiments was developed based on\n\na number of observational studies in the area, as well as in situ data presented in the pre-\n\nvious chapters. The developed Feature Models, for the NBUC as well as for the DWBC,\n\nseemed to successfully capture the main attributes of the features of interest, being suit-\n\nable for a process-study assessment of the main characteristics of the flow in the Potiguar\n\nBight.\n\nAfter a long calibration procedure, stable configurations for the experiments\n\nwere reached, yielding realistic mean current speeds and transports, as well as current\n\nwidth and location, according to extensive literature (e. g. Silveira et al. (1994); Schott et\n\nal. (2002)). Therefore, we regard the model results as realistic, considering the process-\n\nstudy aproach here employed. The PE was formed in both experiments, with maximum\n\nvelocity, core depth and size consistent with synoptic observations.\n\nAfter the PE existence, stationarity and variability were adressed in the previous\n\nchapters, we move on to numerical simulations using the process-study aproach in order to\n\nexamine the formation process of this feature. In this process-study approach we intended\n\nto answer two questions. The first one was if the NBUC alone could generate the PE. Our\n\nresults from Experiment # 1 show that the PE is successfully reproduced by the dynamical\n\n\n\n120\n\ninteraction between the parameterized NBUC and local topography. According to the\n\nresults, there is no absolute necessity of the DWBC for the PE to be generated.\n\nThe other question we addressed on this study was about how important the verti-\n\ncal shear is on the generation of the PE, related to the existence of the DWBC. Our results\n\nfrom Experiment # 1 indicate that the DWBC is not essential for the PE generation. How-\n\never, the slight different characteristics of the eddy generated in each experiment suggest\n\nthat the shear induced by the DWBC does modify the PE configuration in comparison to\n\nthe NBUC-only set-up.\n\nBased on the preliminary investigations of the model results presented here, we\n\npropose to address a few more scientific issues with the robust numerical set up estab-\n\nlished in this dissertation. These are identified below as four distinctively separate but\n\nlinked issues. First, we would like to establish the dominant mechanism of instability\n\nfor generation of the PE. From a first-order potential vorticity analysis (not presented)\n\nof Experiment #1, it seems barotropic instability, where the pv changes sign across the\n\ncurrent (CUSHMAN-ROISIN and BECKERS, 2011) might be the dominant mechanism.\n\nHowever, from Experiment # 2, the set-up of potential vorticity shows a possible con-\n\ntribution towards modifying the strength and horizontal/vertical extent of the eddy from\n\na baroclinic shear (dv/dz) perspective between NBUC and DWBC. It is further interest-\n\ning to note the vertical extent of the simulated NBUC being deeper than observations.\n\nThis could be an effect of over-smoothing of the topography, or other numerical set-up\n\n(mixing, resolution, missing flow structure?). We would also like to investigate the con-\n\ntribution of topographic beta in forming the eddy in a meander-eddy-topography related\n\nvorticity analysis, in evaluating and contributing each term of the vorticity balance equa-\n\ntion of both of the experiments carried out so far.\n\nFurthermore, the present set-up allows for changing the feature model param-\n\neters to modify the relative shear between NBUC and DWBC. Observational evidence\n\nfrom Dangler et al. (2004) suggests that the DWBC might break up into eddies south of\n\n8oS when the DWBC is of weaker transport in some seasons. Preliminary evidence of\n\neddy formation from the DWBC is noted from our simulations in Experiment # 2 south\n\nof 8oS for a DWBC transport of 20 Sv. We would like to carry out a third experiment with\n\n\n\n121\n\na DWBC transport of more than 25Sv (also observed at times) to investigate this issue.\n\n\n\n122\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOver this study we were able to achieve the objectives set on Chapter 1, which\n\nwere:\n\n\u2022 to characterize three-dimensionally the PE based on hydrographic and vessel-\n\nmounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data\n\nIn this dissertation we analyzed in situ and altimetry data, as well as numerical\n\nmodel results, with the intent of describing the main characteristics of a subsurface frontal\n\nmeander of the NBUC centered at about 4 oS, 36.5 oW, hereafter Potiguar Eddy (PE). The\n\nPE was first identified in synoptic cruises data, in VMADCP velocity fields. Here we\n\nshow, from these fields, that this feature was observed during two cruises in different\n\ntimes of different years, suggesting a possibly stationary character. The synoptic data\n\nserved to characterize spatially and vertically the PE, specially considering its subsurface\n\ncharacter, which prevents the study of this feature through altimetric data. The Potiguar\n\nEddy is an elliptically shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately 330 and\n\n130 km, with a subsurface signature. It extends vertically from 100 m to 400 m, with\n\nmaximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 and recirculating about 2 Sv of waters from the NBUC.\n\nAs a frontal meander of the NBUC, the PE is assymetric, with a stronger and deeper-\n\nreaching nortwestward (offshore) velocities lobe when compared to the southeastward\n\n(nearshore) velocities one. It must be stressed that, being a subsurface feature, there is no\n\nsignature of the PE at surface near the shelf break; the surface velocity field is persistently\n\nnorthwestward throughout the year.\n\n123\n\n\n\n124\n\n\u2022 to assess the dynamical regime of the PE based on in situ synoptic data\n\nAfter obtaining the general synoptic characteristics of the PE, we used the cruises\n\ndata to make an assessment of the dynamical regime of this feature. A simple calculation\n\nof the Rossby and Burger numbers confirmed that the feature of interest is an anticyclone\n\nwith typical mesoscale characteristics; estimated Rossby number ? 0.3 and Burger num-\n\nber of ? 1, comparable to that estimated by Silveira et al. (2000) for the NBC retroflection\n\ndeep eddies at 5o N. Due to the dominant geostrophic balance in the PE, we also found\n\nreasonable correspondence between geostrophic velocities within the eddy and global nu-\n\nmerical model outputs.\n\n\u2022 to analyze the PE persistence/recurrence and its intraseasonal variability through\n\nmoored current data and altimetry data\n\nAfter the synoptic description of the PE, we turn to the investigation of its vari-\n\nability and persistence. For that, we use currentmeter mooring data from two lines de-\n\nployed in the Potiguar Bight, with an 8-month and a 12-month long time series, which\n\nconfirmed the stationary character of the PE, with a slightly larger vertical extent than that\n\nseen on the VMADCP velocity sections.\n\nAn EOF analysis of the variability of the moored velocity data revealed two im-\n\nportant statistical modes of variability (EOFs); the first with high amplitudes over most of\n\nthe portion of the water column which corresponds to the PE, and the second, associated\n\nwith upper-layer processes. The amplitude time series of the first mode of variability is\n\nfound to have a distinct 25 to 35 day period of oscillation. In order to identify these os-\n\ncillations, we project the dynamical modes onto the statistical ones, to find that the first\n\nEOF is related with the second baroclinic mode. We then hypothesize that second-mode\n\nbaroclinic waves are reaching the Potiguar Bight and imposing variability of the vertical\n\nextent of the PE by deepening and shoaling its lower limit. With the assumption that these\n\noscillations are due to westerward phase-propagating waves, we apply a finite-impulse-\n\nresponse (FIR) filter to the altimetry data. The goal is to investigate the existence of\n\nsignals with periods coincident with the ones we found on the EOF amplitude time series.\n\nThe altimetry filtering revealed 34-day waves in the region, generated west of 15oW in\n\n\n\n125\n\nthe Atlantic and propagating westward along 4oS. These waves are generated during the\n\nmonth of June and reach the Potiguar Bight during September-December, corroborating\n\nthe high energy patches during these months found in the wavelet analysis conducted\n\non the amplitude time series of the first EOF. In order to further investigate the physical\n\nnature this variability, we calculate the wave number from the dispersion equation for\n\nsecond-mode baroclinic Rossby waves. As a result, we obtain the confirmation that the\n\n35-day variability seen on the EOF amplitude time-series is associated with linear free\n\nplanetary Rossby waves about 800 km in length, and probably generated by barotropic\n\ninstability caused by the shear between different zonal currents in the Equatorial Current\n\nsystem.\n\n\u2022 To understand the processes involved on the PE persistence/recurrence through\n\nlonger time scales (semiannual and annual variabilities) via performing analysis of\n\nglobal numerical model outputs\n\nThe limited duration of the currentmenter mooring velocity time series prevented\n\nthe investigation of longer-period variability. Considering that we had found reasonable\n\nagreement between the synoptically-observed PE and global numerical model outputs,\n\nwe analyze the model outputs for lower-frequency variability. We found that the second\n\n(first) numerical model statistical mode is associated with the first (second) EOF mode\n\nfrom the observed mooring data. Fitting an annual signal to the amplitude time series,\n\nwe find that the surface-trapped mode (first EOF mode for model outputs, second EOF\n\nmode for observed mooring data) has a strong component of annual period, confirming\n\nour suspicions that the surface-trapped mode would be related to upper layer processes\n\nand consequently to the trade winds annual cycle over the Atlantic. On the other hand,\n\nthe second EOF mode is associated with the deep structure variability, and therefore more\n\nclosely affecting the PE. For this second mode, the annual harmonic amplitude is virtually\n\nnegligle compared to the intraseasonal variability due to the planetary Rossby waves.\n\n\u2022 To address the importance of the vertical shear due to the interaction with the\n\nDWBC on the dynamics of the PE through idealized experiments, applying a Fea-\n\nture Model technique in a primitive-equation numerical model.\n\n\n\n126\n\nIn order to develop insight into the PE generation, we apply the Feature Oriented\n\nRegional Modeling System (FORMS) (GANGOPADHYAY and ROBINSON, 2002) tech-\n\nnique within a process-study framework. The Feature Models for the NBUC and DWBC\n\nwere defined based on a number of observational studies in the region. The developed\n\nFeature Models seemed to successfully capture the main attributes of the features of in-\n\nterest, being suitable for a process-study assessment of the main characteristics of the flow\n\nin the Potiguar Bight.\n\nWe set up two experiments, i. e., a NBUC-only set up, with a maximum depth\n\nof 1500 m, and a NBUC+DWBC set up, with a maximum depth of 5500 m, in order\n\nto investigate if (i) the PE would be generated in a velocity field which contained only\n\nthe NBUC, and (ii) which is the influence, if any, of the NBUC-DWBC shear for the\n\ngeneration and maintenance of the eddy. After a long calibration procedure, stable con-\n\nfigurations for the experiments were reached, yielding realistic mean current speeds and\n\ntransports, as well as current width and location, according to extensive literature (e. g.\n\nSilveira et al. (1994); Schott et al. (2002)). Therefore, we regard the model results as\n\nrealistic, considering the process-study aproach here employed. The Potiguar Eddy was\n\nformed in both experiments, with maximum velocity, core depth and size consistent with\n\nsynoptic observations. As a result, we conclude that the PE can be generated in a velocity\n\nfield containing only the NBUC; and the DWBC - induced shear seems to play a part on\n\nthe eddy\u2019s caracteristics (vertical extent, maximum velocities, etc), since the PE had a\n\ndifferent formation processes in each experiment.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAVISO.
