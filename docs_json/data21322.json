Materiais PMOs, com \ngrupos fenileno e bifenileno bissililados, foram modificados por introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de \ngrupos funcionais amina, utilizando uma das seguintes metodologias: \ni) rea\u00e7\u00e3o de co-condensa\u00e7\u00e3o;  \nii) p\u00f3s-modifica\u00e7\u00e3o da ponte org\u00e2nica;  \niii) \"grafting\". \nO tamanho dos poros das PMOs funcionalizadas e n\u00e3o funcionalizadas foi \ndefinido pelo tamanho da cadeia alquilada da mol\u00e9cula molde (surfactante) \nutilizada na s\u00edntese do material poroso. Estudou-se o efeito do di\u00e2metro dos \nporos na separa\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2/CH4. Investigou-se tamb\u00e9m estrat\u00e9gias alternativas \npara modificar as propriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas dos materiais atrav\u00e9s de rea\u00e7\u00f5es \nde superf\u00edcie utilizando irradia\u00e7\u00e3o de micro-ondas; deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de camada \nat\u00f3mica (ALD) de \u00f3xido de alum\u00ednio; e carboniza\u00e7\u00e3o dos materiais em atmosfera \ninerte. \nA investiga\u00e7\u00e3o experimental foi efectuada em paralelo com estudos \ncomputacionais. Realizou-se um estudo de simula\u00e7\u00e3o molecular recorrendo ao \nm\u00e9todo de DFT, e usando um arranjo regular de grupos fenileno-s\u00edlica, para \ndeterminar as caracter\u00edsticas ideais dos materiais para promover a separa\u00e7\u00e3o \nde metano do di\u00f3xido de carbono em misturas destes gases. Foi utilizado um \nmodelo simples, obtido pela repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de uma c\u00e9lula unit\u00e1ria com 3 an\u00e9is \nfenileno, para simular a parede dos materiais PMOs e desta forma selecionar e \navaliar as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os gases e os grupos funcionais presentes na \nsuperf\u00edcie dos materiais. A tend\u00eancia do r\u00e1cio entre energias de intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre \na estrutura da parede do fenileno - PMO e as mol\u00e9culas de CO2 e de CH4 foi \nconcordante com os r\u00e1cios das constantes de Henry obtidos pela t\u00e9cnica de \nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o. Demonstrou-se uma boa sinergia entre tarefas experimentais e \ncomputacionais, o que permite a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos, evitando a s\u00edntese \ndesnecess\u00e1ria de materiais que se antecipem serem pouco eficazes para o \nprocesso de separa\u00e7\u00e3o de misturas gasosas CO2 e CH4. \nAssim, a abordagem seguida nesta tese para alcan\u00e7ar adsorventes eficazes foi \nbaseada numa conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o interdisciplinar envolvendo troca de informa\u00e7\u00e3o entre \nas tarefas de s\u00edntese, modela\u00e7\u00e3o computacional e adsor\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nPeriodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs), amination, microwave, catalysis, \nadsorption, density functional theory (DFT), periodic model approach. \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe main objective of this PhD Thesis was the design of periodic mesoporous \norganosilicas (PMOs) for applications in carbon dioxide and methane separation. \nNovel PMOs were prepared by the modification of phenylene and biphenylene \nPMO materials with different amine functionalities through one of the three \nfollowing synthetic strategies: \ni) co-condensation reaction; \nii) organic bridge post-modification; or/and \niii) grafting. \nThe pore size of both functionalized and non-functionalized phenylene PMOs \nwas regulated by the size of the alkyl-chain in the surfactant template. Materials \nwith different pore sizes were used to understand the influence of the pore \ndiameter on the CO2/CH4 separation. Additionally, it was aimed to explore \nalternative strategies to modify the physical-chemical properties of the materials \nsuch as microwave-assisted functionalization; atomic layer deposition (ALD) of \naluminum oxide at the PMO surfaces; and carbonization of the PMO materials. \nThe experimental research was performed in parallel with computational studies. \nA molecular simulation study, using the DFT method and a regular arrangement \nof phenylene-silica groups, of the ideal characteristics of the adsorbent materials, \nfor CO2/CH4 separation was performed. It was used a simple model of the wall \nof the PMO materials obtained by the repetition of a unit cell with 3 phenylene \nrings, to select and evaluate interactions between gases and functional groups \nin the surface of the materials. The tendency between the ratio of the interaction \nenergies between the wall structure of the phenylene-PMO and the CO2 and CH4 \nmolecules was in good agreement with the ratio of the Henry constants achieved \nby the adsorption technique. Therefore, a good synergy between experimental \nand computational tasks was implemented to optimize the resources, avoiding \nthe synthesis of ineffective materials. \nThus, the strategy of this PhD Thesis to achieve effective adsorbents was based \non an interdisciplinary approach and on the ability to link and interchange \ninformation between synthetic, computer modeling and adsorption experiments. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \nFigure 1.1.

Several concerns have been associated to the expanding of the population \n\nwhich together with the strong economic progress leads to an increase of the world energy \n\ndemand. Associated to the growth of the number of the humans there are also concerns \n\nassociated with the rising production of organic waste and the intensive animal agriculture \n\nthat all together foment the production of greenhouse gases. The emission of these gases to \n\nthe atmosphere promotes the greenhouse effect and, consequently, leads to an increase of \n\nthe temperature of our planet, promoting climate changes. Thus, a possible solution is to take \n\nadvantage of these gases for energy production. Biogas is an alternative energy source, \n\nproduced through the anaerobic digestion process of large variety of organic waste, such as \n\nsewage, animal byproducts, agricultural, industrial, and municipal solid wastes,  \n\nFigure 1.1.[1\u20137] Biogas is mainly composed by methane (60-70%) and carbon dioxide  \n\n(30-40%), and presents also trace gases such as H2S, CO, H2 and N2, dust and dirt particles. \n\n \nFigure 1.1. Biogas: a renewable energy. \n \n\nSince impurities may cause corrosion, deposits and damage to equipment, it is required the \n\ncomplete removal of all the contaminant species in biogas to produce biomethane. \n\nAdditionally, if the biogas is to be upgraded for household applications (standard natural \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n3 \n\n \n\ngas) or car fuel, it is also critical the removal of CO2 since it reduces the energy content of \n\nbiogas.[1\u20134,8,9] For example, to introduce the biogas at the natural gas pipelines, the methane \n\ngas needs to present a level of purification of 97%. Therefore, an energy efficient process to \n\nuptake CO2 from CH4 is required to spread the application of biogas, avoiding the corrosion \n\nof equipment and pipelines by the CO2 acidic gas.[10,11] Moreover, up-taken CO2 can be then \n\nused as refrigerant or at the agriculture production (through adsorption of CO2 by the green \n\nplants) together with the biofertilizer obtained during the anaerobic digestion of the organic \n\nwaste.[1,12] Current methodologies to purify off-gas (the effluent gas produced from the \n\nanaerobic digestion process of organic matter) and to increase its caloric value[1] are \n\nabsorption, cryogenic distillation, membrane separation, and adsorption.[12,13] The main \n\ncommercial solutions available for CO2 uptake from biogas use absorption process through \n\nthe use of amine based solvents able to react chemically with CO2, such as monoethanol \n\namine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyl diethanolamine (MDEA), with chemical \n\nstructures represented in Figure 1.2. \n\n \nFigure 1.2. Chemical structures of MEA, DEA and MDEA. \n \n\nMonoethanol amines are the most common solvents used due to their low cost. The available \n\ncommercial technologies for CO2/CH4 separation present several drawbacks associated to \n\nthe low CO2 loading capacity of the solvent (0.40 kg CO2 / kg MEA); degradation of the \n\namine solvent in contact with NOx, SOx, O2 gases; high cost of solution regeneration \n\n(concomitantly the CO2 absorption capacity of the regenerated amine solution decreases); \n\ncorrosion of the equipment by the amine solution and the scale up of the process. An \n\nalternative technology uses sterically hindered amines for CO2 absorption. These have a low \n\ncorrosive nature and less degradation from O2 when compared to MEA as a solvent. \n\nHowever, the capacity to adsorb CO2 is lower than the capacity observed for the MEA \n\nsolution. Another process, aqua ammonia (NH3), has been attracting attention due to the \n\nassumption that it could simultaneously remove NOx and SOx along with CO2 from flue \n\ngases. This process presents high CO2 loading capacity when compared to other absorption \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n4 \n\n \n\nprocesses (1.20 kg CO2 / kg ammonia), and enables the control of several different pollutants \n\nat the same time. Additionally, it does not present equipment corrosion issues or absorbent \n\ndegradation by oxygen. The resulting ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate \n\n(subproducts from the adsorption process) can be used as fertilizers. Although this process \n\nalso presents some disadvantages, for instance i) the flue gas must be cooled to 15\u201327 \u00b0C \n\ndue to volatility of ammonia, ii) additional equipment is necessary due to precipitates \n\nformation upon CO2 capture and iii) high ammonia vapor losses occur during stripping.[13]  \n\nBased on the limitations associated with the absorption technologies described above, the \n\ndevelopment of solid adsorbents to uptake CO2 via adsorption separation has been thought \n\nas an alternative. The adsorption technology is a very attractive technique from small to \n\nmedium-scale operations, but it relies on the availability of highly effective adsorbent \n\nmaterials, requiring the preparation of materials with different nature and structure.[14] \n\nVarious mesoporous and microporous adsorbents, Figure 1.3, such as activated  \n\ncarbons[15\u201319], metal organic frameworks (MOFs)[15,20,21], zeolites and zeolitic imidazolate \n\nframework (ZIFs)[10,15,22\u201325], clays[26,27], and silica-based mesoporous materials[28,29] have \n\nbeen proposed for CO2 adsorption/separation from biogas. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.3. Development timeline of the porous material families according to the pore size. \n \n\nThe CO2 capture capacities on several different materials, e.g. carbons, MOFs, zeolites and \n\nZIFs, clays and silicas, have been reported in the literature.[30] Selected data for materials \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n5 \n\n \n\nused in the separation of CO2/CH4 are presented in Table 1.1. As it can be observed, all \n\nmaterials exposed adsorb more CO2 than CH4 at temperatures between 25 and 35 \u00b0C. In the \n\ncase of the MAC (microwave activated carbon) material, the data were determined at \n\ndifferent temperatures with concomitant effects on the values of the capacities. For instance, \n\nMAC shows a 20% reduction in the CO2 capacity upon temperature increase from 25 to 35 \n\n\u00b0C. The CO2/CH4 adsorption capacity ratio also decreases with the increase of temperature.  \n\nMOFs materials presenting Ni[31] or Mg[31] as metal centers adsorb higher amounts of CO2 \n\nthan MOFs prepared with Cu[32] or Al[33], but the ratio of the CO2/CH4 capacities is very low, \n\nwhen compared with the MOF with amine functionalities. \n\nZeolites and ZIFs adsorbents demonstrate CO2 capacities inferior to those displayed by the \n\nMOFs CPO-27-Ni[31] and CPO-27-Mg[31], but the former also adsorb much smaller amounts \n\nof CH4, giving rise to a larger ratio between the CO2 and CH4 capacities. \n\n \nTable 1.1.

A material showing high molar selectivity ratio is \n\nAPTES@STMBF[38], which is an SBA-15 pore expanded silica prepared by condensation \n\nreaction of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under the presence of P123 as structure directing \n\nagent, trimethylbenzene as swelling agent and ammonium fluoride as solubility enhancer, \n\nfollowed by grafting of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). Although, these adsorbents \n\nare still not ideal for CO2 uptake from biogas mainly due to the following reasons: the ideal \n\nadsorbent needs to present the optimal features as high capacity, perfect selectivity, long-\n\nterm durability, good mechanical stability, fast uptake processes, easy regeneration \n\nconsistent with negligible capacity loss on multiple adsorption/desorption cycles and low \n\ntoxicity.[40] \n\nIn order to attain these aims, the aromatic bridged-PMOs incorporating some modifications \n\nare proposed as adsorbents for CO2/CH4 gas separation. PMOs are easy to prepare and \n\nexhibit crystal-like walls, high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and high thermal \n\nstability.[41\u201343] Additionally, a good diffusion of the molecules can be achieved within the \n\nchannels of the Ph-PMOs as the organic functions are an integral part of the walls of these \n\nmaterials. The control of the porosity of the PMOs is made through the use of template-\n\nassisted self-assembly method. Likewise on silica materials, the amine chemical \n\nmodification of the Ph-PMO[44] can be done to improve the affinity of the materials to \n\ninteractions with CO2 without changing that with CH4. \n\nThe novelty of the present PhD work is the tuning of the adsorption properties of PMOs \n\nthrough functionalization of their organic groups, using new synthetic strategies. Thus, the \n\ninclusion of different amino groups in PMOs is investigated for creating materials with high \n\n?-? conjugation and different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character. To the best of our \n\nknowledge, only a few examples of the preparation of amine-functionalized PMOs were \n\nreported in the literature and none of them were tested in the proposed applications. \n\nMoreover, all experimental work is performed in close synergy with the theoretical \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n7 \n\n \n\ncalculations. Additionally, other non-conventional approaches were also used to improve the \n\nCO2 adsorption properties of the PMOs and their selectivity for the CO2/CH4 separation. \n\nThe following section starts with a brief review of the history of how PMO materials \n\nemerged from silica, which organic functions were introduced in these materials, and which \n\ntextural, physical and chemical properties were expected to be obtained with such \n\nmodifications. \n\n \n\n1.3 Ordered mesoporous silica materials \n\nNanostructured porous materials have been prepared by a bottom-up approach,[45\u201348] such as \n\ntemplate-assisted self-assembly method,[46,48] in which the nanomolecular blocks are \n\narranged around surfactant micelles via weak interactions.[49] This procedure allows the \n\ntuning of the pore shape, size and connectivity, as well as of the chemical composition. \n\nIn this PhD Thesis, the self-assembly methodology is extensively used to prepare organic-\n\ninorganic hybrid nanoporous material such as PMOs. These materials combine organic and \n\ninorganic properties and have received much attention in the last two decades. \n\nPMOs, discovered in 1999[41\u201343], are mesoporous 2D structures formed by bissilylated \n\norganic bridges linked to each other by silica moieties,[50] which resemble periodic \n\nmesoporous silicas (PMS).[51\u201353] The M41S family of materials denoted as MCM (Mobil \n\nComposition of Matter)[54,55] and SBA (Santa Barbara amorphous)[54,55] materials are the \n\nmost known PMSs.[50,55] PMSs and PMOs can have different shapes and pore sizes \n\ndepending on the choice of the structured directing agent (SDA) and reaction conditions (pH, \n\ntemperature, reaction time and precursors). Many similarities are found between the \n\nsynthetic procedures of PMOs, SBAs and MCMs.[55] Their formation occurs through \n\nhydrolysis and condensation of the silica precursors around the supra-molecular assembly \n\nformed from a wide range of anionic and cationic surfactants, or gemini or triblock \n\ncopolymers or oligomers under basic, acid or neutral conditions.[56,57] The porous material \n\ncan be obtained by hydrothermal treatment or evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA),[50] \n\nand the free porosity is achieved through surfactant removal by solvent extraction in acidic \n\nmedia or calcination.[54] Two different mechanisms were proposed to explain the formation \n\nof these materials as presented in Figure 1.4. The first is a true liquid-crystal templating \n\n(TLCT) mechanism, which is observed in the absence of inorganic species under very high \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n8 \n\n \n\nconcentrations of the surfactant (Figure 1.4a).[57\u201359] The second mechanism occurs at low \n\nconcentration of template, and involves the formation of the lyotropic liquid-crystalline \n\nphase by self-assembly cooperation of the template and inorganic precursor. This one is \n\ndesigned as cooperative liquid crystal template (CLCT) mechanism (Figure 1.4b). The \n\nformation of the porous material via TLCT or CLCT is still a matter of scientific debate but \n\nrecent computational studies support the latter (please refer to Ref. [60] and references \n\ntherein). \n\n \nFigure 1.4. Preparation of periodic mesoporous materials in the presence of supramolecular \nstructure-directing agents following a) TLCT or b) CLCT mechanisms. Adapted from reference [61]. \n \n\nHexagonal, cubic, or laminar pore arrangements can be obtained, Figure 1.5.[57,62] \n\n \nFigure 1.5. Hexagonal, cubic and laminar pore arrangements reported in the literature. Adapted from \nreference [57]. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n9 \n\n \n\nBesides a narrow distribution of the pore sizes and are higly ordered, PMSs present very \n\ninteresting properties such as large specific surface areas, and  as they possess a large number \n\nof free silanols, they can be easily modified to incorporate functional groups for the desired \n\napplication. \n\n \n1.3.1 Introduction of functional groups into porous materials \n\nMCMs and SBAs have been largely applied in catalysis and adsorption, using polymeric, \n\ninorganic, organic and organometallic hosts into the pores.[41] The combination of inorganic \n\nand organic functionalities can be made through i) grafting or ii) co-condensation \n\nreaction.[63] In this way, the PMS materials can be tuned to obtain different polarities and/or \n\nnew reaction centers. \n\n \n1.3.2 Post-grafting functionalization of parent silica materials \n\nThe grafting[45] takes place when an organic silylated precursor (with a formula \n\n(R\u2019O)3Si-R) is added to the parent silica and reacts with the free silanols, Figure 1.6. Other \n\nprecursors can be used to modify the silica materials, such as chlorosilanes (ClSiR3), long-\n\nchain alcohols and silazanes (HNSiR3).[57,58,63,64] Hence, a variety of organic groups, from \n\nacid to basic functionalities, can also be introduced inside the pores by changing the nature \n\nof the R groups in the material. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6. Functionalization of the PMS materials with terminal organosilanes using the grafting \nmethod. R is the organic function. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n10 \n\n \n\nAlthough, the grafting typically leads to a decrease of specific surface area depending on \n\nboth content and size of the group introduced. A drawback of the grafting technique is related \n\nwith the diffusion of the species inside the pores since pore blockage may occur, especially \n\nwhen bulky species are used, reacting preferentially at the extremities of the channels. \n\nMoreover, heterogeneous distribution of the introduced organic moieties tends to arise from \n\nthe grafting method[57] and the thermal stability of the materials is usually affected by the \n\nintroduction of the organic moieties. \n\n \n1.3.3 Co-condensation synthesis \n\nAn alternative process for the incorporation of functional groups into PMSs is the  \n\nco-condensation reaction. The functionalities are introduced in the material during the \n\nsynthesis by adding to the silica precursor a terminal trialkoxysilanes (R\u2019O)3Si-R, where R \n\nis the organic group. The hydrolysis and condensation of the two precursors takes place in \n\nthe presence of SDA under basic, acid or neutral conditions.[57,58,63,64] The resulting material \n\ndisplays organic groups distributed along the pore walls, Figure 1.7. The advantages of the \n\nco-condensation reaction when compared to the grafting methodology are the absence of \n\npore blocking and bulkier organic groups and higher loading of organics can be introduced \n\nin the material. As a result, functional groups are usually more homogeneously distributed \n\nin the framework. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7. Co-condensation synthesis of Si(OR\u2019\u2019)4 with organosilanes precursors in the presence of \nSDA. R is the organic function. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\nHowever, the mesostructure order of the material is affected when the concentration of the \n\norganic precursors increases by more than 40 mol%. High contents of organic functions also \n\ncan promote the reduction of the specific surface areas and originate broad pore-size \n\ndistributions, which limit the shape, size and selectivity of these materials.[17] Moreover, a \n\nhuge increase of the terminal organic silanes leads to different rates in the hydrolysis and \n\ncondensations of different precursors favoring the homocondensation reaction of both \n\nprecursors. [17] When this takes place the homogenous distribution of the precursor can be \n\nhardly achieved. In this synthetic approach the SDA removal must be done by extraction.[57] \n\nAs in the case of the grafting, co-condensation method can be used to prepare organic-\n\ninorganic hybrid silicas incorporating a vast range of organic functionalities under well-\n\nchosen synthetic conditions. \n\n \n\n1.4 Crystal-like periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) \n\nAs organic functionalized PMSs present several drawbacks, such as low organic content \n\n(less than 20%), reduced specific surface area, heterogeneity, potential leaching of organic \n\nspecies during application, PMOs appear as an interesting alternative to PMSs since the \n\norganic moieties are important elements of the skeleton of the material. The most dramatic \n\nchange between the synthetic strategies of PMS and PMO materials is the use of a \n\nbissilylated organic precursor in the latter, instead of a pure inorganic silica source in the \n\nformer. The organic moiety in the case of PMOs is strategically placed between the silicon \n\natoms in order to directly integrate the wall of the material, keeping the pore channel free \n\nfor potential applications.[41\u201343] Still, it is important to note that the distribution of functional \n\ngroups in the walls of PMO materials is quite uniform while in the case of functionalized \n\nPMS materials, the functional groups essentially appear at the surface of the material.[41\u201343] \n\nDespite the high concentration of organic groups, PMOs usually present high thermal \n\nstability. This occurs due to the intercalation of organic/inorganic groups in the pore walls, \n\nenhancing the stability of the material. \n\nA large number of bissilylated precursors has been used to prepare PMOs with different \n\ntextural, physical and chemical characteristics with some examples being shown in  \n\nFigure 1.8.  \n\nStudies in the field not only aim the synthesis of novel PMOs based on new bissilylated \n\nprecursors, but also aspire the modification of the known precursors to improve properties \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n12 \n\n \n\nof these materials. Despite the appearance of numerous reports in the literature showing that \n\nPMOs bring important advantages when compared to other commercial materials, PMOs \n\nhave not yet been introduced into the commercial market. The properties of these materials \n\nin some cases (for example for microelectronics) bring numerous advantages when \n\ncompared to alternative products already under commercialization. However, the high price \n\nrequired to produce PMOs is a major drawback. \n\n \n \nFigure 1.8. Structures of typical bissilylated precursors used to prepare PMOs. \n \n\nFor catalysis and adsorption applications, the properties of these materials are not yet the \n\ndesirable ones having into account the high price when compared with those of alternative \n\nmaterials under use. Tuning the properties of PMOs for adsorption applications was the \n\nultimate objective of this PhD Thesis. This was done by considering several synthetic \n\nprocedures to introduce the desired functionalities into the materials, which were selected \n\nby previous analysis of the literature. A short review of the most remarkable advances in the \n\nfield is provided below, together with suggested ways to improve the characteristics of \n\nPMOs, with special attention for materials prepared from nitrogen source precursors. \n\n \n1.4.1 Single source precursor \n\nOzin et al.[41] described the synthesis of the ethene-PMO by hydrolysis and condensation of \n\n1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethene (BTEE) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide \n\n(CTAB) under aqueous basic conditions. The free pores were obtained by solvent extraction. \n\nThe ethene-PMO displayed well-ordered hexagonal mesostructure (Table 1.2) and high \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n13 \n\n \n\nsurface area (637 m2\u00b7g-1). Then, the ethene bridge was brominated, rendering further \n\nchemical transformations readily accessible. \n\nInagaki et al.[42] reported the preparation of the ethane-PMO using as bissilylated precursor \n\nthe 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane (BTME). The variation of the synthesis conditions \n\n(varying the proportion of the reagents, the ageing time and the hydrothermal time) led to \n\nthe formation of two materials, one possessing 2D hexagonal mesophase and the other \n\ndisplaying 3D hexagonal mesophase, Table 1.2.[42] \n\n \nTable 1.2.

The (110) and (200) reflection are expected for a \nhexagonal order material.  gThis information is not given in the report. The unit cell size was calculated from \nd100 reflection pattern obtained from the report. hPore diameter calculated using classical density functional \ntheory (DFT). \n \n\nStein et al.[43] also synthetized the ethane-PMO material but using different reaction \n\nconditions, such as pH, stirring time, reagents concentrations, and in the absence of \n\nhydrothermal treatment. The same authors also obtained the ethylene-PMO (a.k.a. ethene-\n\nPMO) with wormlike channels having uniform diameter.[43] Interestingly, the materials \n\nprepared by Stein and co-workers[43] were not as ordered as the materials prepared by \n\nInagaki[42] and Ozin[41] groups, which suggests that the reaction conditions used to prepare \n\nthese materials have huge influence in the mesostructures obtained. Ozin et al.[70] reported \n\nthe preparation of phenylene- (Ph-), thiophene-, ferrocene-, bithiophene- and acetylene-\n\nPMOs. Despite the attempts in changing the synthetic conditions to obtain well-ordered \n\nmaterials, these authors could only prepare the Ph- and the thiophene-PMO with 2D \n\nhexagonal symmetry mesophase. The ferrocene- and the bithiophene-PMOs displayed poor \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n14 \n\n \n\norder, while the acetylene-PMO was difficult to control under aqueous media since it \n\npresented labile Si\u2013C bonds. \n\nIn 2002, Inagaki and co-workers[51] synthetized, for the first time, a Ph-PMO showing meso- \n\nand molecular-scale periodicities. The Ph-PMO possesses a 2D p6mm symmetry lattice and \n\na structural periodicity in the wall along the channel direction with a spacing of 7.6 \u00c5, Table \n\n1.2. In addition, these authors were able to sulfonate the aromatic benzene groups, paving \n\nthe way for further synthetic modifications in these materials. In the same year, Inagaki et \n\nal.[65] also reported the preparation of p-biphenylene-PMO (Bph-PMO) using a similar \n\nsynthesis procedure. Bph-PMO also displayed meso- and molecular-scale (interlayer \n\nspacing of 11.9 \u00c5) periodicities and 2D hexagonal structure. Recently, Comotti et al.[71] \n\ndemonstrated that this material stands out for its ability to present rotation motion. Through \n\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy the authors proved the dynamic behavior \n\nand verified the existence of parallel and aligned molecular rotors along the mesochannel \n\naxes. \n\nHa and co-workers[66] synthetized a non-ordered PMO with basic functionalities by \n\ncondensation of bis[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]amine (BTMSPA) using P123 under acidic \n\nconditions, Table 1.2. The BTMSPA-PMO displayed hydrophilic silicate layers and it was \n\ntested, together with Ph-PMO and Bph-PMO materials, in the adsorption of lysozyme. They \n\nfound that the amine moieties of the BTMSPA-PMO material did not interact with the \n\nlysozyme, and preferential lysozyme-PMO interaction was observed for the Ph-PMO and \n\nBph-PMO, wich displayed hydrophobicity superior to BTMSPA-PMO. But, the interaction \n\nwas suggested to be related also with the silanols groups as displayed by the different loading \n\nin each material. In fact, the BTMSPA-PMO only possesses 30% free silanols groups against \n\nabout 70% of free silanols observed in the other PMOs. Therefore, in order to obtain \n\nadditional information about the preferential interaction mechanism, the same authors[72] \n\nreported the use of these three materials in the adsorption of L-lysine (strong hydrophilicity), \n\nisoleucine (strong hydrophobicity) and glycine (intermediate character, i.e., weak \n\nhydrophobic/hydrophilic properties). L-lysine was mainly adsorbed by BTMSPA-PMO, \n\nwhile isoleucine adsorbed more into Bph-PMO. Although, glycine was preferentially \n\nadsorbed by hydrophobic Ph- and Bph-PMOs in comparison to BTMSPA-PMO. The authors \n\nshowed the importance of electrostatic interactions between PMOs and the adsorbed amino \n\nacids; they observed that the maximum amount of amino acid adsorbed occurs in the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n15 \n\n \n\nisoelectric point of the amino acid. Furthermore, the pore size diameter of the materials also \n\nhad significant contribution in the adsorption of the amino acids. More recently, Ha and  \n\nco-workers[73] explored the capability of these three PMOs to adsorb nicotine from aqueous \n\nsolution. The nicotine exhibits hydrophobic character being strongly adsorbed by Ph-PMO \n\nand, as in the case of the amino acids, it was observed a strong dependence between \n\nadsorption properties and isoelectric point and hydrophobicity of the PMOs. \n\nDuan et al.[67] prepared a PMO material based on [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-\n\nethylenediamine (TMSEN) precursor in the presence of non-ionic P123 surfactant and water. \n\nThe disordered material presented a BET surface area of 310 m2\u00b7g-1 and an average pore \n\ndiameter of 107 \u00c5 (c.f. Table 1.2). They tested the TMSEN-PMO material in heavy metal \n\nion removal from water (ultra-pure water). The adsorbent showed high adsorption capacity \n\nfor CuII (1.2 mmol\u00b7g-1) and PbII (1.3 mmol\u00b7g-1) ions and could be reused for several times \n\nwithout minimal loss of its capacity as an adsorbent. Additionally, high selectivity for CuII \n\nover NiII and CoII was found, which turns this material a potential candidate for wastewater \n\ntreatment, drinking water purification and soil remediation. \n\nBeretta et al.[68] prepared divinylaniline organic bridging PMO (BTEVA-PMO) with 2D \n\nhexagonal mesostructure, with three reflections indexed having Miller indices (100), (110) \n\nand (200) and with a unit cell dimension of 47.8 \u00c5, Table 1.2. Additionally to the meso-\n\nordering of the pores, this PMO also presents crystal-like pore walls with a molecular-scale \n\nperiodicity of 11.8 \u00c5. This material has specific surface area of 900 m2\u00b7g-1 and a pore \n\ndiameter of 28 \u00c5. The access of the amino group in the aniline moieties of the BTEVA-PMO \n\nto further modifications was tested through chemical functionalization of the amine group \n\nwith the amino-acid L-alanine by formation of an amide bond. Thus, the authors \n\ndemonstrated that BTEVA-PMO is a good candidate for the formation of oligopeptides \n\nwithin the pores. \n\nIn 2015, Mizoshita and Inagaki[69] prepared a new PMO (CHTC-PMO) with  \n\nN,N',N''-tris(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxamide precursor \n\n(CHTC) in the presence of octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ODTMA) surfactant \n\nunder basic conditions. The prepared functional material showed both meso- and molecular-\n\nscale orders. The authors only observed a strong (100) reflection in powder X-ray \n\ndiffractometer (PXRD), but using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) they observed \n\nsome PMO areas with 2D hexagonal packing and a lattice constant of 62.0 \u00c5 (d = 53.6 \u00c5), \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n16 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2. The authors also observed the molecular-scale periodicity along the channel \n\ndirection with a lattice constant of 16.5 \u00c5 (d = 14.3 \u00c5). Thus, the CHTC-PMO presents both \n\nmeso- and molecular-scale orders and this was possible due to the high self-assembly \n\nbehavior of the precursor. Additionally, the authors found that the pore walls of this material \n\ncould bind strongly silane-free guest molecules through H-bonded intercalation. This fact is \n\nvery interesting due to the potential combination of H-bonded intercalation with chemical \n\nmodification of silanol groups for constructing multifunctional PMOs. \n\nKuschel and Polarz[74] developed a new PMO with increased chemical versatility, containing \n\nbrominated-phenylene moieties that can be accessible to further modification reactions. To \n\nprepare such material these authors started from a new precursor, 5-bis(triisopropoxysilyl)-\n\n3-bromobenzene, in the presence of Pluronic F123 triblock copolymer in ethanol under \n\nacidic conditions. Beside the efforts to obtain a material with ordered pores, they could only \n\nobtain a bromine-phenylene-PMO with worm-like ordering. \n\nBion et al.[75] considered different SDAs (alkyltrimethylammonium halides) to obtain  \n\nPh-PMO materials with 2D hexagonal mesostructure, but with different pore sizes. They \n\nobserved that changing the alkyl-chain of the surfactant resulted in Ph-PMOs presenting \n\ndifferent physical and textural properties. The alkyl-chain of the surfactants varied from \n\nfourteen to eighteen carbons. The surfactant with the biggest alkyl-chain promoted the \n\nformation of a Ph-PMO with large pore size, Table 1.3.  \n\n \nTable 1.3.

The authors found that the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n17 \n\n \n\nphenylene-PMO materials with 2D hexagonal pore order and varied pore sizes present a \n\nspecific surface area between 640 and 782 m2\u00b7g-1, while the disordered phenylene-silica \n\nmaterials have specific surface areas between 650 and 910 m2\u00b7g-1. It was observed that the \n\nmaterials exhibit a reversible hydrogen excess surface adsorption capacity up to 2.10 wt% \n\nat 6 MPa and 77 K and the increase of the alkyl length of the surfactant seems to increase \n\nthe hydrogen molecules on the adsorbent. Additionally, a direct correlation between physical \n\nproperties of the prepared materials and the hydrogen adsorption behavior was found. For \n\nthe case of the phenylene-PMOs, the authors observed an increase of the hydrogen capacity \n\nwith the increase of the specific surface area, while the hydrogen capacity of the disordered \n\nmesoporous phenylene-silica adsorbents increases with the increase of pore volume and pore \n\nsize. \n\nFr\u00f6ba et al.[76] also prepared the Ph- and the thiophene-PMO with different pore sizes but \n\nextremely ordered. The authors promoted the hydrolysis and the condensation of the \n\nprecursors (1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, BTEB, or 2,5-bis(triethoxysilyl)thiophene, \n\nBTET) in the presence of P123 and Brij 76 copolymers as SDA under acidic conditions. \n\nOrdered materials with 2D hexagonal (p6mm) mesoporous structures were formed. It was \n\npossible to control the pore sizes by changing the SDA. The P123 promoted the formation \n\nof PMOs with pore sizes larger than those obtained with Brij 76. P123 led to larger pore \n\nsizes when the organic moiety of the bissilylated precursor is changed from thiophene to \n\nphenylene, Table 1.3. With Brij 76, the size of the pores remained unchanged independently \n\nof the precursor used. So, the consideration of different bissilylated precursors, SDAs and \n\nreaction conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) allows the preparation of novel PMOs with \n\ndifferent chemical, physical and textural properties.  \n\nOther developments to create PMOs with advanced functional bridges have been reported \n\nin the last few years.[50] These are the cases of the inclusion of heteroatoms such as N, S and \n\nP, or of moieties such as metal complexes, metal nanoparticles or chiral bridges for creating \n\nmaterials with high ?-? conjugation and/or different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, for \n\nadsorption and catalysis applications.[50] \n\nThere are three different methodologies to make possible the introduction of advanced \n\nfunctional groups into the channels of the PMOs: i) co-condensation, ii) organic bridge post-\n\nsynthetic modification and iii) grafting reaction. These three approaches are described \n\nbelow. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n18 \n\n \n\n1.4.2 Co-condensation reaction \n\nCo-condensation synthesis allows the combination of two or more different mono- or \n\nbissilylated organic precursors to produce PMOs with functionalities well distributed into \n\nthe matrix of the material, Figure 1.9. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9. Schematic representation of functionalized-PMOs synthetized via co-condensation \nreaction. R, R\u2019, R\u2019\u2019 represent different organic functions. \n \n\nIn 2002, Inagaki et al.[78] showed for the first time the preparation of a PMO with acidic \n\nfunctionalities using the co-condensation reaction. The novel material was obtained by \n\ncombination of BTEB and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in the presence of \n\nODTMA under basic conditions. It presented the meso- and molecular-scale observed for  \n\nPh-PMO material. The authors varied the proportion of the precursors and found that, as the \n\nMPTMS amount increased, the degree of the mesoscopic order decreased. The 2D hexagonal \n\narrangement of the pores was only well observed at 0.40 mol% of MPTMS, presenting  \n\n0.30 mmol\u00b7g-1 of H+, Table 1.4. Materials with 0.70 mmol\u00b7g-1 of H+ content were also \n\nobtained, but the mesostructure was perturbed. Moreover, the reduction of both surface area \n\nand pore diameter was observed with increasing acid content. After nitric acid treatment, the \n\noxidation of the thiol group was observed with formation of the sulfonic acid group. The \n\nformed material, Ph-PMO_PrSO3H, possessed thermal stability up to 300 \u00b0C. The oxidation \n\nof the thiol group led to a decrease of surface area and pore diameter, and also to a reduction \n\nof the organization degree of the pores mesostructure. The final PMO conjugated the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n19 \n\n \n\nmolecular-scale periodicity with the flexibility of the sulfonic arms. Other bissilylated \n\nprecursors with biphenylene[79] and ethane[80,81] bridges where reacted with MPTMS to give \n\nrise to materials with 2D hexagonal arrangement and different degrees of hydrophobicity, \n\nthermal stability and flexibility in the framework structure. These materials were tested in \n\nwater-generating reactions. Moreover, different SDA, as for instance, cationic alkyl \n\nsurfactant[80] and triblock copolymers,[81] were employed to obtain such acid functionalized \n\nordered materials. \n\n \nTable 1.4.

The authors found that the catalytic \n\nactivity of these materials relies on: i) the density of the sulfonic groups; ii) the location of \n\nthe sulfonic sites and iii) the hydrophobicity of the surface. The material that presented the \n\nhighest activity had phenylene moieties in the pore walls, propyl sulfonic sites grafted to the \n\nsilanols of the Ph-PMO and an acid loading of 0.36 mmol\u00b7g-1. \n\nMaterials showing basic functionalities in the framework of the PMOs were also reported in \n\nthe past few years. In 2006, Wahab et al.[83] reported the formation of well-defined 2D \n\nhexagonal order PMOs fibers when BTEE was mixed with 1-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] \n\nurea (UREDO) or (3-triethoxysilylpropyl) isocyanate (ICP) in the presence of CTAB/Brij30 \n\nsurfactant mixture under basic conditions (Table 1.5, Et-PMO_UREDO and Et-PMO_ICP). \n\nThey showed the influence of the amount of the nitrogen containing precursor in the \n\nformation of the PMOs meso-scale order. Disordered materials were formed with molar \n\npercentages of nitrogen precursors higher than 25 mol%. The basic nature of UREDO or ICP \n\nprecursors led to an increase of the pH during the synthesis, which hindered the organization \n\nof the micelles in a 2D-hexagonal arrangement. The influence of the reaction temperature \n\non the formation and the internal pore architecture was also observed. The change of the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n20 \n\n \n\nreaction temperature from 55 to 75 \u00b0C originated pore channels aligned parallel to fiber axis \n\nwith hexagonal arrangement. Li et al.[84] synthetized the aminopropyl-functionalized ethane-\n\nbridged PMO (Ethane-PMO_APTES) with spherical morphology and cubic Pm3n meso-\n\norder, Table 1.5. The Ethane-PMO_APTES was achieved by co-condensation of  \n\n1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTSE) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in the \n\npresence of ODTMA surfactant and methanol as co-solvent in basic medium. The authors \n\nobserved that methanol was crucial in the formation of spherical morphology and that the \n\nparticle size could be tuned through variation of the aging temperature and time. This \n\nmaterial showed a good mechanical and chemical stability, a specific surface area of  \n\n765 m2\u00b7g-1 and a pore diameter of 40.9 \u00c5. This material was tested in liquid chromatographic \n\nseparation and compared to a commercial APS-2 HYPERSIL NH2 column. The authors \n\ntested the separation of benzene derivatives (toluene, biphenyldimethylesterate and \n\nnitrobenzene) at different flow rates, the separation of metronidazole, fluconazole and \n\nisonicotinic acid under high pH mobile phase (pH 11.8), and the separation of matrine and \n\noxymatrine, sophocarpine and N-oxysophocarpine, under low pH mobile phase (pH 1.6). \n\nThey found that the Ethane-PMO_APTES has a high chemical stability in a wide pH range \n\nand the order of the peaks is the same as in the case of the commercial NH2 column for all \n\nseparations. \n\n \nTable 1.5.

Thus, the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n21 \n\n \n\nauthors concluded that the performance of this material makes it a potential candidate to \n\nsatisfy more rigorous needs in chromatographic analysis. \n\nRecently, Suriyanon et al.[85] prepared three amine-functionalized PMOs via  \n\nco-condensation reaction of BTSE and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS), \n\n[3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane, (APAETMS) and \n\n3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyltrimethoxysilane (APAEAETMS) in the \n\npresence of CTAB under basic conditions. Besides the number of amines in the amino-\n\norganosilane precursor, the amount of these precursors were also varied between 10 and 40 \n\nmol%. All prepared materials presented a hexagonal order of the pores and a high Brunauer\u2013\n\nEmmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area (between 963 and 1230 m2\u00b7g-1). Table 1.5 shows the \n\nphysical properties of the amine modified-PMOs prepared with 40 mol% of amine-\n\nprecursor. The authors observed that the amount of nitrogen on the amine-functionalized \n\nPMOs augmented with the molecular size and the concentration of the amino-organosilanes \n\nused. The increase of the latter parameter also promoted the growth of the wall thickness \n\nand the contraction of the unit cell. Suriyanon and co-workers[85] indorsed the latter behavior \n\nto the decrease of the pore size diameter and suggested that the changes in the physical and \n\ntextural properties were related to the hydrogen bonding ability of the amine-functional \n\ngroups around the micelles of the surfactant. \n\nCoutinho et al.[86] reported the synthesis of Ph-PMOs containing propylamine, \n\npropylethylenediamine, and propyldihydroimidazole groups in the framework by  \n\nco-condensation reaction in the presence of ODTMA surfactant (Table 1.5,  \n\nPh-PMO_APTMS, Ph-PMO_EDATMS and Ph-PMO_ImTES, respectively). These three \n\namine-PMOs displayed both meso- and molecular-scale up to 10 mol% of functional groups. \n\nWhen the amine functional precursor loading increased above that value, the mesoscopic \n\norder was lost, while the molecular periodicity was maintained. This study showed the \n\ndifficulty to prepare PMOs with both high amine-loadings into the framework pore wall and \n\nhigh mesopores order. \n\n \n1.4.3 Organic bridge post-synthetic modification \n\nThe organic post-synthetic modification involves a transformation of the organic bridge after \n\nthe PMO synthesis, Figure 1.10. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10. Schematic representation of post-synthesis modification of the organic bridges of \nPMOs. R and R\u2019 are different organic functions. \n \n\nThe modification of the organic bridges in the PMO materials was successfully attained \n\nimmediately after Stein et al.,[43] Inagaki et al.[42] and Ozin et al.[41] reported the preparation \n\nof the first PMOs. Stein and Ozin and their co-workers showed the bromination of the \n\nethylene moieties and the opportunity to tune the properties of PMOs for a given \n\napplication.[41,43] The insertion of a bromine group into the bridge of PMOs enables the \n\nincorporation of many other functional groups since bromine is a very good leaving group. \n\nNakai et al.[87] reported the bromine addition and successive ethylenediamine (EDA) \n\nsubstitution of the ethylene bridge in the ethylene-PMO, Table 1.6. The authors \n\ndemonstrated that the bromination reaction had little influence on the 2D hexagonal \n\nmesostructure. In contrast, the reaction with EDA leads to an extensive modification of the \n\nmesostructure with perturbation of the pores hexagonal arrangement. The authors also \n\nreported the synthesis of other PMO materials by direct substitution of EDA with chloro-\n\npropyl-ethane resulting in the Cl-Pr-Et-PMO material. The latter presented only a broad low-\n\nangle diffraction peak in the PXRD patterns (Table 1.6) and the substitution of chloride by \n\nEDA did not affect the structure of this material, which was subsequently tested in the \n\nadsorption of arsenate from water. The authors observed that the distance between the amine \n\nfunctional group and the surface of the pore walls had influence in the adsorption of the \n\narsenate. The EDA-Pr-Et-PMO displayed higher capacity in the adsorption of arsenate when \n\ncompared with EDA-Et-PMO due to the distance between the propyl and the silanol groups, \n\nwhich prevented the interaction of those groups. \n\nDe Canck et al.[88] reported the bromination of ethylene bridges followed by nucleophilic \n\nsubstitution of the bromide by diaminobutane (DAB), diaminohexane (DAH), \n\ndiaminododecane (DADD), diethyltriamine (DETA) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n23 \n\n \n\nBy varying the reaction conditions, e.g. temperature and reaction time, different nitrogen \n\ncontent was achieved for each functionalized PMO.  \n\n \nTable 1.6.

DAB substitution reaction resulted in higher nitrogen content \n\nthan with DADD. The difficulties obtained in the substitution of bromide by DADD were \n\nsuggested to be due to poor diffusion of the dodecane chain within the pores of the PMO. \n\nMoreover, the nitrogen content of the material is lower for nucleophiles with long alkyl-\n\nchain than for the other cases considered. All amine materials presented clear 2D hexagonal \n\nmesoporous ordering, with exception of the PMO prepared with the TEPA ligand, which \n\nexhibited just a single reflection in the PXRD patterns assigned to the (100) of the 2D \n\nhexagonal arrangement, Table 1.6. The materials also revealed type IV N2 isotherms \n\ntypically observed for mesoporous materials. The authors observed a decrease on the BET \n\nsurface area (SBET), pore volume (Vp) and pore diameter (dp) values upon functionalization, \n\nwhich indicates the anchorage of the functional groups inside the pores. These five PMOs \n\nwere tested in the CO2 adsorption with the aim of understanding which of the following \n\nproperties, e.g. nitrogen loading, variation in chain length and the presence of primary and \n\nsecondary amines, was the most important to obtain a good adsorbent for this gas. When \n\ncompared with the aminopropyl functionalized SBA-15, De Canck et al.[88] found that \n\nDADD-Et-PMO presented slightly higher adsorption efficiency with a CO2/N ratio of 0.42. \n\nDADD-Et-PMO, with the lowest nitrogen loading (0.33 mmol\u00b7g-1), the longest alkyl-chain \n\nand the smallest amount of secondary amines, seems to be the most interesting PMO for CO2 \n\nadsorption. The reason for the better performance of the latter material was suggested to be \n\nrelated with the presence of amines, at optimal distances (hence, optimal amount) from each \n\nother, so that they could interact simultaneously with the same CO2 molecule. If very large \n\namounts of amines are present in the material, hydrogen bonding between neighboring amine \n\ngroups is more probable to occur, which deactivates the amine moieties for CO2 adsorption. \n\nAdditionally, hydrophobic interactions between long alkyl-chains were suggested to avoid \n\nchain folding, preventing the formation of hydrogen bonding between amines and silanols \n\ngroups; hence, with long alkyl-chain, amines are free to interact with CO2. \n\nRecently, Esquivel et al.[89] showed the ability of the ethene-PMO to be transformed into \n\npyrrole bridge PMOs through Diels-Alder reaction between the former and a family of \n\npyrrole derivatives (pyrrole, methylpyrrole, dimethylpyrrole, trimethylpyrrole and  \n\n1-phenylpyrrole). The obtained pyrrole-PMOs displayed the 2D hexagonal arrangement of \n\nthe pores, showing the preservation of the meso-order of the parent ethene-PMO. They also \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n25 \n\n \n\nobserved reduction in the d spacing value after the chemical modification of the double bond \n\nof the ethene-PMO, which seems to be associated to the structural contraction as a \n\nconsequence of the thermal conditions used during the Diels-Alder reaction. This \n\nfunctionalization process also promoted the reduction of the pore size from 71 \u00c5 to \n\n53-56 \u00c5, which confirms the formation of surface adducts. Additionally, the pore wall \n\nthickness increased in all cases after the chemical modification of the surface as a \n\nconsequence of the volume occupied by the organic groups introduced. The success of the \n\nchemical modification of the Et-PMOs was also confirmed by elemental analysis (EA), \n13C NMR and 29Si NMR spectroscopies. \n\nHoriuchi et al.[90] also modified the ethene-PMO with ethylenediamine (ED) basic sites by \n\nepoxidation of ethylene moieties of the Et-PMO followed by nucleophilic addition,  \n\nTable 1.6. The resultant ED-Et-PMO, presenting a type IV isotherm and a pore diameter of \n\n62 \u00c5, was tested as a solid base catalyst in the Kn\u00f6venagel condensation reaction between \n\nbenzaldehyde and various active methylene compounds. They also produced a material with \n\nbifunctional catalytic properties by introducing Au nanoparticles into the ED-Et-PMO. The \n\nobtained Au-ED-Et-PMO displayed a reduction of the pore size to 54 \u00c5, which is in \n\nagreement with the insertion of gold nanoparticles into the PMO. This material was \n\nsuccessfully tested on both alcohol oxidation and Kn\u00f6venagel condensation in a one-pot \n\ntandem reaction. Horiuchi et al.[90] also prepared a second bifunctional PMO, using the same \n\nprocedure, where the Et-PMO was functionalized with N,N-dimethylethylenediamine \n\nfollowed by introduction of Pd nanoparticles into the pores to catalyze the Tsuji\u2013Trost \n\nreaction. \n\nIn 2002, Inagaki\u2019s research group demonstrated the versatility of the phenylene moieties in \n\nthe Ph-PMO material, through the introduction of functional groups by electrophilic \n\nsubstitution attack of the phenylene bridge. They showed that chemical modification was \n\npossible by post-synthetic sulfonation of the phenylene bridge to offer the \n\nSO3H-Ph-PMO.[42] In 2008, the same group reported the amination of 28% of phenylene \n\nmoieties of PMO, in a two-step chemical transformation process without destroying both \n\nmeso- and molecular-scales periodicities.[44] The NH2-Ph-PMO was successfully applied in \n\nthe Kn\u00f6venagel condensation reaction of malononitrile with benzaldehyde. The possibility \n\nto reutilize this material for further use was also revealed. Moreover the amination of the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n26 \n\n \n\nphenylene moieties provides the possibility to transform the amine group into other \n\nfunctional groups. \n\nIn order to make the phenylene-PMO even more appellative to catalysis, sorption, \n\nscavenging and other applications, Smeulders et al.[91] attempted the bromination of the \n\nphenylene moieties of the Ph-PMO using different post-modification methodologies. The \n\nfirst method used AlCl3 as a catalyst in combination with Br2. The second approach relies in \n\nthe use of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as bromine source combined with the radical initiator \n\nazobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The third and last procedure pretended to generate bromine, \n\nin situ, by adding sulfuric acid to sodium bromate (NaBrO3). The authors observed that the \n\nprinciples of organic chemistry are not directly transported to nanoporous material science \n\nas occurred with the sulfonation and nitration reactions modifications of phenylene bridge \n\nPMOs. The bromination reaction using the NBS and AIBN reagents was not effective, while \n\nthe methods that used Br2 and NaBrO3 as bromine sources promoted the bromination of the \n\nphenylene moieties of PMO. However, these two last procedures gave rise to a huge amount \n\nof silicon\u2013carbon bond cleavage and this fact had a destructive effect on the PMO \n\nframework. \n\n \n1.4.4 Grafting \n\nThe grafting procedure comprises the chemical modification of the surface free silanols after \n\nthe PMO synthesis through addition of an organosilicate agent, Figure 1.11. \n\n \nFigure 1.11. Schematic representation of post-synthesis modification of the surface chemistry of \nPMOs via grafting methodology. R and R\u2019\u2019 are different organic functions. \n \n\nIn 2005, Zhang et al.[92] synthetized a bifunctional material by grafting the MPTMS to free \n\nsilanols of the methylene-bridge PMO, previously prepared in the presence of structural \n\ndirecting agent P123 under acid conditions. The grafting reaction occurred in the presence \n\nof toluene under reflux. The resulting material, SH@Me-PMO, preserved the 2D hexagonal \n\narrangement of the pores observed in the parent material and the SBET and dp decreased \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n27 \n\n \n\nproviding further evidence that the methylene-PMO was efficiently functionalized via \n\ngrafting. It was possible to introduce into the channels 0.8 mmol\u00b7g-1 of S content, Table 1.7. \n\nDub\u00e9 et al.[93] prepared the PFSO3H@ethane-PMO, with a loading of 0.8 mmol H+\u00b7g-1, by \n\ngrafting reaction of the ethane-PMO with the perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid group. This \n\nmaterial revealed high catalytic activity in self-condensation of heptanal and heptanal \n\nacetalization by 1-butanol, but some problems of lixiviation of the organic functionalities \n\nfrom the PMO were reported by the authors upon the reutilization of the material. \n\n \nTable 1.7.

The material was tested in the Diels-Alder \n\ncycloaddition of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with trans-cinnamaldehyde and reused several times. \n\n \nTable 1.8.

This material was obtained by grafting of trimethylsilyl \n\n(TMS), benzyldimethylsilyl (BzDMS) and dimethylsilyl ferrocene (DMSFc) groups to the \n\nPh-PMO, Table 1.8. The insertion of these functional groups along the pore wall channels \n\noriginated a decrease of the intensity of the (100) reflection, a contraction of the unit cell \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n28 \n\n \n\nparameter and reduction of the BET surface area and pore diameter as expected for this type \n\nof grafting reaction. The success of the chemical modifications was followed by Fourier \n\ntransform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopies. The DMSFc@Ph-PMOs was tested as \n\nsolid catalyst in the oxidation of styrene and presented moderate activity and high selectivity. \n\nRecently, Sim et al.[96] grafted alkyl amine functionalities (APTES, APAETMS and ImTES) \n\nonto the silanols of phenylene-bridged PMO and of SBA-15. Ph-PMOs based materials \n\npossess a unit cell parameter in the range of 116.0 and 126.7 \u00c5, while the values determined \n\nfor the amine-modified SBA-15 are in the range of 116.0 and 118.9 \u00c5. All amine-\n\nfunctionalized materials preserved the hexagonal order of the mesopores of the parent-\n\nPMOs. The amine-functionalized Ph-PMO and silica were tested in the adsorption of pure \n\nCO2 at 25 \u00b0C in a pressure range up to 1.2 atm. The authors observed that the \n\nAPAETMS@Ph-PMO (see physical properties in Table 1.8) adsorbs a larger amount of CO2 \n\nat a faster adsorption rate when compared with APAETMS@SBA-15, which demonstrates \n\nthat the functionalization of PMOs with amines is more relevant than a similar degree and \n\nnature of functionalization in pure silica for the adsorption of CO2. Interestingly, the \n\nunmodified SBA-15 silica also adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 when compared with the \n\nunmodified PMO. This behavior was explained by the higher hydrophobicity of the PMO \n\npore wall when compared with that of SBA-15. Hence, water adsorption is expected to be \n\nmore acute in SBA-15 than in PMO materials, competing more with CO2 for available \n\nadsorption sites on the former class of materials, so, organosilica instead of pure silica \n\nsupports were proposed for immobilization of amines groups aiming materials for CO2 \n\nadsorption/separation. Despite the fact that PMOs are more expensive than silica, the \n\nsuperior ability of amine modified PMOs to adsorb CO2 can be transferred and should be \n\nexplored for such applications. \n\nIn summary, the introduction of acidic or basic groups into the PMO frameworks can be \n\nmade using different methods. The post-functionalization methodologies have been given \n\nmuch attention due to the opportunity to introduce interesting functionalities onto the surface \n\nof the pores, and to create different degrees of porosity in the materials, without affecting \n\nsignificantly the arrangement of the pores. Additionally, the possibility to extend typical \n\nhomogeneous phase reactions to functionalize hybrid materials has been successfully \n\nreported in the literature and opens an avenue to tune the materials properties for new \n\napplications. The co-condensation of different bissilylated precursors can offer novel PMOs \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n29 \n\n \n\nwith better performances that those prepared by post-modified materials, due to the \n\nintroduction of the functionality as part of the PMO framework, remaining the pores free for \n\nthe desired application. The development of acid- or amine-PMO materials with optimal \n\nfeatures for different applications needs to take into account several different factors, such \n\nas, functional group loading, surface area, pore volume and pore size, distances between \n\nfunctional groups and between functional groups and silanols, and the \n\nhydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the framework. \n\nAs it is understood from Section 1.2, the presence of amines is mostly a requisite in the \n\npreparation of adsorbents for biogas upgrading. Thus, besides the factors described above, \n\nthe tuning of the PMOs properties must also have into account the nature of the amino groups \n\nto maximize interactions with CO2. The ideal PMO adsorbent must be chemically stable and \n\nreused in multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. Despite the interest of PMOs for biogas \n\nupgrading, no literature was found for the preparation and utilization of PMOs in the \n\nseparation of CO2 and CH4. There are only, two studies where amine modified-PMOs were \n\ntested in the CO2 adsorption. \n\nTable 1.9 summarizes the nitrogen containing PMOs previously described and their possible \n\napplications. The presentation of these materials is made through type of synthesis used: \n\ncondensation, post-synthesis modification of the organic bridge, co-condensation and \n\ngrafting reaction. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n30 \n\n \n\nTable 1.9.

Most studies used approaches based \n\non the density functional theory (DFT) together with small, finite size, molecular models \n[97\u2013102] but, more recently, studies appeared in the literature relying on classical molecular \n\ndynamics (MD) approaches[103] or models repeated periodically in three-dimensions[103\u2013105]. \n\nThe computational studies also focused on the primer steps of the synthesis of PMO \n\nmaterials, i.e., the interaction between silica monomers or small oligomers and their \n\ncondensation in order to produce organosilica. \n\nShirai et al.[101] studied the cleavage of Si-C bond in various organosilane precursors  \n\n(Figure 1.12), with general structure RSi(OH)3, by DFT calculations. Considering the \n\nB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) methodology the authors determined the proton affinities of the \n\ncarbon atom at the ipso-position and of the carbanion produced after Si-C bond cleavage in \n\nthe precursors.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.12. Models of organosilane precursors with formula RSi(OH)3, where R is: a) phenyl;  \nb) terphenyl, c) biphenyl, d) anthranyl, e) naphthyl and f) N-methylcarbazolyl. Adapted from \nreference [101]. \n \n\nThe selection of the proton affinities at these two sites was taken as they act as indices for \n\nthe stability of Si-C bond in the presence of acidic and basic conditions, respectively. The \n\nobtained computational and experimental results were found to be in qualitative agreement. \n\nThe authors observed that the terphenyl and N-methylcarbaxole R groups are the least stable \n\nunder acidic conditions, and the terphenyl and anthranyl R groups are the least stable under \n\nSi(OH)3\n\nSi(OH)3\n\nSi(OH)3\n\nSi(OH)3\n\nSi(OH)3\n\nSi(OH)3\n\na)\n\nc)\n\ne)\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nf)\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n32 \n\n \n\nbasic conditions. Curiously, the cleavage of Si-C bond was observed experimentally for \n\nthese cases, while the Si-C bond in the other precursors was stronger. Accordingly, the \n\ncomputational study confirmed that the reaction giving rise to the cleavage of Si-C bond, \n\nunder acid conditions, results via formation of ?-complex by introduction of H+ at the carbon \n\natom at the ipso-position in the organosilane precursors, (Figure 1.13a). The cleavage of  \n\nSi-C bond, under basic conditions, occurs through generation of the intermediate complex, \n\nwhere the OH\u2013 species links directly the Si atom of the organosilane precursors  \n\n(Figure 1.13b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.13. General mechanism for Si-C bond cleavage in the reaction of organosilane \npolycondensation to organosilica under a) acidic and b) basic conditions proposed in reference [101]. \n \n\nVery Recently, S\u00e1nchez et al.[60] developed a theoretical model to understand the synthesis \n\nmechanism of PMS that is believed to be similar to that of the PMOs. This study was made \n\nusing a multiscale simulation strategy to describe the molecular-level routes behind the \n\nconstruction of silica/cationic surfactant mesophases during the preparation of templated \n\nMCM-41 materials. The authors considered a new coarse-grained explicit-solvent model for \n\nthe synthesis solution with coarse-grained parameters for silicate species tuned with \n\nreference to a detailed atomistic model[106,107] that was derived from quantum mechanical \n\ncalculations.[108,109] The usage of a coarse-grained approach allowed to reach the time and \n\nthe length scales required for the spontaneous formation of mesophase structures with a \n\nrealism that enables direct comparison with experimental systems. S\u00e1nchez and  \n\nco-workers[60] observed that at low-concentration surfactant solution, the silica oligomers \n\npresent an important factor in the formation of hexagonal arrangement of the pores. The \n\nsilica oligomers present multiple negative charges and are capable to connect to adjacent \n\nmicelles through the head-group areas, acting as multidentate binding spots. This was found \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n33 \n\n \n\nto be crucial for micelle overcoming their mutual repulsion, due to the positively charged \n\nhead-groups, to create larger surfactant aggregates. This fact promotes the separation of the \n\nsystem into a dilute solution and a concentrated silica/surfactant ordered mesophase, as \n\nobserved experimentally. In the case of addition of silica monomers to a low-concentration \n\nsurfactant solution, these authors observed that the small spherical micelles are fused to form \n\nelongated rod-like aggregates, but the presence of monomers only is not enough to form an \n\nHLC phase. For occurrence of phase formation it was necessary at least 15-33% of silicate \n\noligomers either in the form of dimers or larger silicate species. Without changing any \n\nparameter in the model, they could find different mesophase structures by changing the \n\ncharge density of the silicate oligomers, either by increasing their degree of condensation or \n\ntheir degree of deprotonation. For instance, with oligomers displaying high silica charge \n\ndensity, the curvature of the mesophase structures is reduced and a lamellar system is \n\nobtained. The degree of flexibility of the mesophase could also be modified by changing the \n\ncomposition of the synthesis solution; for instance, by addition/removal of a co-solvent (e.g. \n\nbenzene) to the solution, it was possible to describe the reversibility of the hexagonal phase \n\nto lamellar structure as observed experimentally.[110] \n\nFutamura et al.[103] studied the effect of the nature of the organic linker in the early stages of \n\nthe templated synthesis of PMO materials. They considered a classical MD approach to \n\nsimulate the surfactant\u2013bromide\u2013water solutions with several different organosilicate \n\nprecursors based on 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene or  \n\n1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (Figure 1.8). The choice of these three precursors was made \n\nhaving into account different degrees of molecular-scale periodicity found in the materials \n\nsynthetized experimentally: high degree, low degree, and no molecular-scale periodicity, \n\nrespectively.[51] Futamura et al.[103] observed that the presence or absence of the molecular-\n\nscale periodicity in the pore walls of PMOs is defined by tight interaction between the \n\nsurfactant micelle and the organosilica and by a certain flexibility and orientation of the \n\norganic linker. Experimentally, it was found that the PMOs prepared using the  \n\n1,1-bis(triethoxysilyl)methane and 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane precursors, did not present \n\nmolecular-scale periodicity, and this fact could be explained by the size of the organic linker \n\nand the strength of the interaction between the precursor molecules when compared with the \n\nphenylene- and ethylene-PMOs.[51] In addition, the presence of molecular-scale periodicity \n\nwas endorsed to the surfactant mesostructure. Notice, however, that phenylene- and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n34 \n\n \n\nbiphenyl- PMOs with high degree of molecular scale periodicity were prepared without the \n\npresence of surfactants.[111] The classical MD simulations by Futamura et al.[103] considered \n\nsystems composed of water, decyltrimethylammonium surfactants and deprotonated \n\norganosilicates obtained from 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene \n\nor 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane. The results demonstrated that the organic and inorganic \n\nfragments of the benzenesilicates and of the ethylenesilicates were evidently introduced \n\nbetween the cationic surfactant head-groups in the micelles, while in the case of \n\nethanesilicates, only the inorganic part interacted with the surface of the micelle. \n\nRemarkably, this leads to the construction of micelles taking more surfactants (i.e., larger \n\namount of average micelle size along the simulation) in the former cases comparatively to \n\nthe latter. These interpretations can be associated to a more efficient screening of the \n\nsurfactant head-group repulsion, which stimulates the reduction of the curvature of the \n\nsurface and therefore the formation of bigger micelles.[103] Futamura et al.[103] found also \n\nthat the ordering of the organosilicates in the solutions with benzenesilicates or \n\nethylenesilicates, was much superior when comparing to the organosilicates organization of \n\nthe solution with ethanesilicates. Such differences were related to the way how the \n\norganosilicates are oriented relatively to the micelles. In the cases of the solutions with \n\nbenzenesilicates or ethylenesilicates, the silicate-organic-silicate axis approximated parallel \n\nto the micelle surface, while ethanesilicates prefer to orient their silicate-organic-silicate axis \n\nperpendicularly to the surface, which was suggested to be a possible cause for the inferior \n\nordering of the synthetized materials with the ethane linker. In this way, the presence or \n\nabsence of the periodicity of the molecular order along the channel direction was suggested \n\nto be highly dependent of the interactions between surfactant micelles and organosilicates \n\nand the relative flexibility and orientation of the organic moieties, i.e., organosilicates with \n\nless flexibility interacted strongly with the micelle surface of the surfactant, leading to the \n\npreparation of PMOs with higher degrees of molecular-scale periodicity when compared to \n\nPMO materials synthetized using more flexible organo-bridged silicates that interacted \n\nweakly with the surfactant micelles surface.[103] In summary, the studies above suggest that \n\nthe hexagonal-order and the periodicity of the molecular-scale in the pore walls of PMOs \n\nare defined during the first steps of the templated synthesis process. \n\nThe structure of PMOs can be modeled with cluster or periodic model approaches. The first \n\none pretends to study a small portion of the PMO in vacuum and the second one pretends to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n35 \n\n \n\nmodel an infinite repetition of a suitable unit cell in the three spatial dimensions. Both \n\napproaches present benefits and drawbacks,[112] and the choice of one or another depends on \n\nseveral factors, as for example, computational code and approach, and the property that one \n\nwants to calculate. \n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) provides a very good compromise between the quality of \n\ncalculated data and the computational resources requirements. Moreover, modern DFT \n\napproaches can take into account dispersion interactions which affect dramatically weakly \n\nbonded systems.[112] Since molecular systems like PMO materials are composed of millions \n\nof atoms, only small portions of the materials, e.g. isolated finite clusters or small unit cells \n\nrepeated periodically, can be used in computer calculations. The simulation of models based \n\non large clusters or large unit cells requires the reduction of the complexity of the \n\ncomputational approach, either by reducing the quality of the grids used in the calculations \n\nor by considering less expensive approaches, e.g. semi-empirical or classical methods.[113]  \n\nThere are few examples of works based on the application of DFT approaches to study \n\nPMOs. Onida et al.[97] combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nspectroscopy and DFT to study the surface properties of the Ph-PMO material, having into \n\naccount both meso- and molecular-scale periodicities. The FTIR and computational studies \n\nwere made in the pristine material and also in the material interacting with CO, H2CO and \n\nNH3 molecules. The authors used the DFT calculations (achieved at the B3LYP/6-31+G* \n\nlevel of theory) to assign the infrared (IR) modes experimentally observed. The calculations \n\nemploying the molecular models represented in Figure 1.14 were used to compare the \n\nvibrational shifts in Ph-PMOs with those obtained for amorphous silica. \n\nThe assignment of the most important bands in the Raman and IR spectra of Ph-PMO,  \n\nEt-PMO, Bph-PMO and thiophene-PMO throughout DFT calculations was conducted by \n\nHoffman et al.[98] also using the B3LYP hybrid approach. The authors found that vibrational \n\nspectroscopy is unable to provide conclusive observations that can be used to understand the \n\nintegrity of the Si-C bonds in PMO or similar organosilica materials because wavenumber \n\nshifts change from precursors to the corresponding PMO materials. In this way the modes \n\nare unpredictable, making each material a single case. Thus, Hoffman and his co-workers \n\nproposed the use of solid-state NMR for similar studies.[98]  \n\nTheoretical studies are also very useful to understand where functionalization in the organic \n\nmoieties can occur and which are the preferential sites for adsorption in the functionalized- \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n36 \n\n \n\nor non-functionalized PMOs. This can be done by comparison of the calculated energies for \n\nmaterials having substitutions at different materials or of the calculated energies for \n\nadsorbates at different locations in the PMO material, respectively. \n\nCamarota et al.[99] studied the low-temperature adsorption of CO on Ph-PMO by FTIR \n\nspectroscopy and by theoretical calculations. Again, these authors considered the DFT \n\nhybrid B3LYP approach, but incorporating dispersion corrections based on the ideas of  \n\nGrimme et al.[114], and the same cluster model employed by Onida et al.[97], which is \n\ndisplayed in Figure 1.14. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.14. Molecular structures of cluster models for Ph-PMO (left) and for amorphous silica \n(right). Color code for atomic spheres is: H, white; C, black; O, red; and Si, yellow. Adapted from \nreference [97]. \n \n\nThey observed the presence of three kinds of adsorbed CO molecules at low coverage: the \n\nfirst one corresponds to the physisorbed CO, which interacts with the benzene moieties, \n\nperforming as Lewis bases, and with the H-bonded to the silanol group, acting as week Lewis \n\nacidic centers. The second and the third ones correspond to stronger interactions via carbon \n\nand oxygen atoms. Camarota et al.[99] verified that at low CO coverages, both C-bonded and \n\nO-bonded species displayed double interaction, promoting an interaction enthalpy higher \n\nthan that of CO with the isolated silanol of amorphous silica. The enthalpies observed for \n\nthese interactions are similar, leading to the simultaneously occurrence of the three types of \n\nCO adsorption processes mentioned above. \n\nMartinez and Pacchioni[104] studied the interaction of CO, CO2 and CH4 molecules with the \n\nflat areas of the nanopores of the three-dimensional periodic lattice of p-Ph-PMO through \n\nthe use of a periodic unit cell and DFT calculations (where they applied specific corrections \n\nto include dispersion forces). The construction of the models had into account the \n\nexperimental structural information available in the literature.[51,115] The authors considered \n\ntwo models of p-Ph-PMO with different amounts of Tm species of silanols in the surface of \n\nthe material and different sequences of silica bonded to the aromatic moieties, Figure 1.15. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.15. Models of the walls of phenylene-PMO formed by six-member rings (a) or formed by \na sequence of six- and four-member rings (b). Color code for atomic spheres is: H, white; C, black; \nO, red; and Si, yellow. Adapted from reference [104]. \n \n\nThe three molecules presented preferential interaction with the silanol groups and displayed \n\nadsorption energies characteristic of physisorbed states. The authors pretended with this \n\ncomputational study to understand the possibility of the PMO material to store or to separate \n\nthe molecules previously mentioned. Furthermore, the choice of these three molecules was \n\nestablished on their inherent features, i.e., the CO presents a small permanent dipole \n\nmoment, the CO2 manifests a quadrupole moment and the CH4 displays an apolar nature. \n\nThe authors observed a similar interaction of the Ph-PMO with the CO and CO2 molecules, \n\nwhich are considerably stronger than the interaction with the CH4 molecules. With this study, \n\nMartinez and Pacchioni[104] demonstrated that the dispersion part of the interaction is \n\nconsiderable high (about one half of the total value). In order to interpret the influence of \n\ndispersion in the adsorption of these molecules, they performed additional calculations \n\nwhere the walls of the PMO were changed either by doping or transforming the inorganic or \n\norganic parts of the framework. In the case of the introduction of Ti\u2013OH, Si\u2013O or Al\u2013OH \n\ngroups they did not observe significant changes in the adsorption energies when compared \n\nwith the parent material. Martinez and Pacchioni[104] also reported the effect of the organic \n\nfunctionalization of the material in the adsorbate-substrate interaction. In this way, the \n\norganic part was modified by the authors through substitution of the C-H in the phenylene \n\nbridge by N, giving rise to the pyridine group and by substitution of the phenylene bridge by \n\nthe biphenylene organic linker. The introduction of the pyridine group as linker instead of \n\nthe phenylene group originated an increase of the interaction energies with the CO and CO2 \n\nmolecules and the opposite effect is verified for the interaction energy with CH4. In the case \n\nof the use of the biphenylene bridge, a reduction of the calculated interaction energies was \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n38 \n\n \n\nfound. Despite the change of the organic bridge of the PMOs, the interaction energies of the \n\nmolecules with the silanols  are more than twice bigger than with the organic functions, \n\nremaining the silanols groups the preferential adsorption sites as observed for the  \n\nPh-PMO.[104] \n\nKalantzopoulos et al.[77] used DFT calculations (PBE functional without dispersion \n\ncorrections) to elucidate the hydrogen adsorption on phenylene-PMO. They calculated a \n\nbinding strength of hydrogen with the pore walls of the PMO of -0.55 kcal\u00b7mol-1, which is \n\nhigher than the computed interaction energies for hydrogen interaction with a single benzene \n\nmolecule or with the aromatic bridge of IRMOF-1. The same authors also performed grand \n\ncanonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations using a simplistic periodic model derived by \n\nInagaki et al. and observed that no hydrogen molecules could be introduced inside the wall \n\nstructure of the PMO materials. \n\nIn summary, computer simulations can be very useful to find locations in the PMO materials \n\nwhere interaction with adsorbates would be enhanced. They can also be employed to predict \n\nwhich chemical groups are able to increase the adsorption capacity and to enhance the \n\nselectivity towards a specific adsorbate. \n\n \n\nIn this PhD Thesis it is expected to find different strategies for the synthesis and modification \n\nof aromatic bridged-PMOs in order to tune their properties and to improve their ability for \n\nadsorption/separation of CO2 from CH4. Thus, the preparation of PMOs with different pore \n\nsizes, the inclusion of different amino groups, the introduction of aluminum oxide species \n\nand the carbonization of PMOs are investigated for creating materials with high ?-? \n\nconjugation and different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character. \n\nA PhD Thesis Roadmap for the synthesis, functionalization and characterization of PMO \n\nmaterials is displayed in Figure 1.16, to guide the reader in this journey, and to present the \n\nPMOs materials that are reported in each Chapter. In this PhD Thesis Roadmap, it is also \n\npossible to known which are the materials that were studied by DFT modelling and tested in \n\nthe CO2 and CH4 adsorption. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n39 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.16.

Characterization of PMOs \n\nThe PMO materials present high specific surface areas, narrow distribution of pore sizes, \n\ntuneable pore size and arrangement, good thermal stability, alternating hydrophobic and \n\nhydrophilic bits and the organic moieties are modifiable. In this way, Transmission Electron \n\nMicroscopy[1] (TEM); Scanning Electron Microscopy[2] (SEM); Powder X-Ray \n\nDiffraction[3] (PXRD); -196 \u00b0C nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms[4,5] (N2 sorption \n\nisotherms); Nuclear Magnetic Resonance[6\u20138] (NMR) and Fourier Transformed Infrared[9] \n\n(FTIR) spectroscopies; Elemental Analysis[10,11] (EA); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy[12] \n\n(XPS) and ThermoGravimetric Analysis[13] (TGA) are the common techniques necessary to \n\nevaluate the physical, textural and chemical properties of this kind of materials. PXRD and \n\nTEM provide information about the pore arrangement and the molecular-scale periodicity \n\nof the material, while TGA affords evidences about the thermal stability of the material and \n\nalso about the amount of the organic groups incorporated in the PMO. FTIR, NMR \n\nspectroscopies and EA give information on the functional groups, local environment of the \n\nchemical elements and quantitative chemical elemental data of the material, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n48 \n\n \n\n2.1 Synthesis of bissilylated precursors \n\nThe 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB) and 4,4?-bis(triethoxysilyl)-1,1?-biphenyl \n\n(BTEBP) were prepared via the Grignard reaction which was followed by distillation in \n\nvacuum using a procedure described in literature.[14] \n\n \nChemicals reagents \n\nMagnesium, (purum, Aldrich), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%, Aldrich), iodine (99.8%, \n\nFluka), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.5%, molecular sieves, Sigma-Aldrich),  \n\n1,4-dibromobenzene (98%, Aldrich), hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) and  \n\n4,4'-dibromobiphenyl (95%, Aldrich) were used as received. \n\n \n1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene synthesis \n\nA typical synthesis starts with the addition of 3 small crystals of iodine to a mixture of dry \n\nmagnesium turnings (5.14 g), TEOS (60 mL) and dry THF (40 mL) under nitrogen. Then \n\nthe temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to 50 \u00b0C and a solution of  \n\n1,4-bromobenzene (16.45 g) in dry THF (31mL) was added dropwise over 2 h. After, the \n\nreaction mixture was kept under reflux overnight. The resulting grey-greenish mixture was \n\ncooled to room temperature and followed by removal of the THF under vacuum. Then, \n\nhexane (80 mL) was added to precipitate any remaining magnesium salts in solution, and \n\nthe mixture was quickly filtered under nitrogen to afford a clear, light brown solution. \n\nAfterwards, the hexane and the remaining TEOS were distilled off under vacuum leading to \n\na brownish oil. The oil was distilled (1.5 torr, 200-205 \u00b0C) to give a clear and colorless oil \n\n(BTEB, approx. 6.4 g). The characterization of BTEB was in concordance to the one \n\npreviously described in the literature.[14] \n\n \n4,4'-bis(triethoxysilyl)biphenyl synthesis \n\nA solution of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl (15 g) in dry THF (113 mL) and TEOS (75 mL) was \n\nadded to dry magnesium turnings (4.5 g). The reaction mixture was kept at reflux (75 \u00b0C) \n\nfor 5 days. The resulting turbid, grey-greenish mixture was worked up as with BTEB to \n\nafford a viscous brown oil. Distillation (0.3 torr, 205-210 \u00b0C) yielded a clear and colorless \n\noil (BTEBP, approx. 1.5 g). The characterization of BTEBP was in concordance with the \n\none previously described in the literature.[14] \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n49 \n\n \n\n2.2 PMO material synthesis and functionalization \n\nThe synthesis of the phenylene- and biphenylene- PMOs and their functionalizations are \n\ndetailed in the following chapters.

All chemicals were used as received. \n\n \n\n2.3 Structural and morphological studies \n\nTransmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy \n\nThe PMOs prepared in this PhD Thesis have a 2D hexagonal symmetry lattice (so, they have \n\nuniform mesopores with a determined diameter arranged in a hexagonal manner), which is \n\nexpected to be observed using high-resolution TEM with a [001] incident beam, parallel to \n\nthe channels (Figure 2.2a).[15]  \n\nUsing high-resolution TEM with [100] incident beam, perpendicular to the channels, we \n\nmay visualize the molecular-scale order along the channels (Figure 2.2b).[15] \n\nThe surface, shape, topography, size and level of aggregation of the powder particles of the \n\nPMOs were also studied. The SEM technique was used to obtain this kind of information.[2] \n\nMicroscopy techniques can also be used to obtain a chemical characterization of the samples, \n\ni.e., it is possible to observe the mapping areas of different elemental composition. This \n\nrequires the usage of an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector with the TEM \n\nor SEM equipments.[1,2] \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Schematic models of mesoporous phenylene-silica resulting from the data collected from \nTEM images and electron diffraction patterns. The images and the patterns are collected in the correct \norientation relation, i.e., the diffraction spots and corresponding lattice planes are normal to each \nother. a) Image and pattern taken with [001] incidence, parallel to the channels. The pores are \norganized uniformely and in the hexagonal manner and present a diameter of ? 38 \u00c5; b), Image \nobtained with [100] incident beam, perpendicular to the channels. The circles represent the lattice \nfringes with a spacing of 7.6 \u00c5 that are observed in the pore walls. In this case, the wavy contrast \nthat is perpendicular to the lattice fringes and with a spacing of 45.5 \u00c5 (d ? ?3a/2) is not observed as \nreported previously by Inagaki and co-workers.[15] The contrast of spacings at 7.6 \u00c5 and 45.5 \u00c5 \ncannot be observed simultaneously even using the best conditions, once the contrast transfer function \nof the objective lens on focus condition is different for both. \n \n\nTEM images were recorded using three different equipments: a 300 kV Hitachi  \n\nH-9000-NA instrument equipped with CCD camera, a 200 kV High Resolution (HR) and \n\nenergy filtered (EF) TEM JEOL 2200FS instrument equipped with digital camera, Orius \n\nSC1000B, and a TEM JEOL 2100 UHR equipped with analysis EDX Si(Li) and camera \n\nCCD Gatan ultrascan (2k x 2k).  \n\nThe preparation of the samples was done as follows: first, PMO samples shown in  \n\nChapter 4.1 were inserted into a polymeric resin and cut by ultramicrotomy with a diamond \n\nknife to have a thickness between 50 nm and 70 nm; then, the sections cut were deposited \n\non grids with holey carbon film. The remaining samples considered in this PhD Thesis were \n\ndeeply crushed using mortar and pestle, dispersed in ethanol and, then, a few drops of the \n\nsuspensions were placed on holey carbon copper microgrids. \n\nThe SEM micrographs were acquired on a SEM-FEG Hitachi SU-70 microscope operated \n\nat 25 kV equipped with microanalysis system for energy dispersive spectrometry of \n\nX-rays/EDS from Bruker Quantax 400 EDS detector, using the same TEM copper grids. \n\n \nPowder X-ray diffraction \n\nThe structural order of the samples was also studied by PXRD and N2 sorption-isotherms. \n\nFrom PXRD it can be extracted information about the lattice parameters of the materials and \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n52 \n\n \n\nalso about the observed mesoporosity and molecular periodicity of the materials prepared. \n\nDespite PMO materials do no present the crystalline arrangement of the atoms, they show \n\norganization of the pores and the electron density contrast created by such periodicity (2D \n\nhexagonal symmetry in the case of the materials studied in this PhD Thesis) can be detected \n\nby the PXRD technique.[15] Thus, we can use the Bragg\u2019s law equation: \n\n \nn?Cu = 2d sin(?) (Equation 2.1) \n\n \nto determine the inter-planar distance d, in which n is an integral multiple of the wavelength, \n\n?Cu is the wavelength of the X-ray (in the case a Cu K? signal) and ? is the incidence angle. \n\nThe lattice constant (a0) characteristic of a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) \n\nlattice is determined from the d spacing of the 100 reflection using the following equation: \n\n \na0 = 2d100/?3 (Equation 2.2) \n\n \nFurthermore, the samples prepared in this study are expected to possess the molecular-scale \n\nperiodicity, which is related to the very regular alternation of the hydrophobic and \n\nhydrophilic layers. These are expected to be detected using the PXRD technique, by \n\nobservation of an additional peak at the medium-scale angle range, corresponding to the size \n\nof the repeating unit. This periodicity is represented in Figure 2.3 by the interplanar distance \n\nd001. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Representation of the meso- and molecular- scale orders of a PMO material with 2D \nhexagonal symmetry. Adapted from reference [15]. \n \n\nMost of the PXRD data were gathered with a Rigaku Geigerflex D Max-C Series \n\ndiffractometer using Cu-K? radiation (?Cu = 1.5406 \u00c5). The diffractograms were acquired \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n53 \n\n \n\nwith 2? from 1-40 \u00b0, with a step size of 0.02 \u00b0 and acquisition times between 3 and 60 s per \n\nstep. \n\nAs example, a typical diffractogram of PhC18PMO is shown in Figure 2.4. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.4. PXRD diffraction patterns of PhC18PMO, showing the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the \npores by observation of d spacing of the 100, 110 and 200 reflections and also the molecular-scale \nperiodicity through the presence of the interplanar distance d001. \n \n\nLow temperature (-196 \u00b0C) nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms \n\nThe N2 sorption isotherms provide information about the type of isotherm (Figure 2.5) and \n\nof the presence or absence of hysteresis loops.[4,5] \n\nA brief description of each type of isotherm is provided below as this technique is important \n\nin the characterization of PMO materials. \n\nReversible type I isotherms are observed for microporous solids with rather small external \n\nsurface area (e.g., some activated carbons, molecular sieve zeolites and certain porous \n\noxides). As can be observed in Figure 2.5, the type I isotherm presents a concave form and \n\nthe quantity adsorbed gets close to a limit value. The approximation to this limiting uptake \n\nis ruled by the accessible micropore volume and not by the internal surface area. The uptake \n\nsteep observed at very low relative pressure is related to the improved adsorbent-adsorptive \n\ninteractions in narrow micropores (micropores of molecular dimensions). The type I \n\nisotherms can be divided in type Ia and Ib isotherms for -196 \u00b0C nitrogen and -186 \u00b0C argon \n\nadsorption. Type Ia isotherms is usually detected for microporous materials having mainly \n\nnarrow micropores (of width &lt;? 1 nm) while the type Ib isotherms are observed in materials \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n2?

Types of physisorption isotherms. Adapted from reference [5]. \n \n\nThe reversible type II isotherms are observed in nonporous or macroporous materials that \n\nadsorb most gases by the physisorption mechanism. The shape is the result of unrestricted \n\nmonolayer-multilayer adsorption up to high relative pressure. This type of curve shows a \n\npoint B, and if the lap is loud, point B generally agrees to the achievement of monolayer \n\ncoverage. \n\nType III isotherm does not present monolayer formation because point B is absent. Materials \n\npresenting this kind of isotherm curve show relatively weak adsorbent-adsorbate interactions \n\nand the adsorbed molecules are gathered around the most promising locations on the surface \n\nof the materials. This type of isotherm curve is typically observed in nonporous or \n\nmacroporous solids. \n\nMesopores adsorbents show type IV isotherms. The adsorption performance in mesoporous \n\nmaterials results from the adsorbent-adsorptive interactions and also from the interactions \n\namong the molecules in the condensed state. In this kind of isotherm, the initial monolayer-\n\nmultilayer adsorption on the mesoporous walls is followed by pore condensation.  \n\nA distinctive characteristic of this kind of isotherms is a final saturation plateau, of variable \n\nlength. As type I isotherms, type IV isotherms can be divided in type IVa and type IVb \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n55 \n\n \n\nisotherms. The type IVa isotherm presents capillary condensation due to hysteresis.  \n\nThis happens when the pore width exceeds a determined critical size, depending on the \n\nadsorption system and temperature. For adsorbents presenting small mesopores, fully \n\nreversible type IVb isotherms are observed. Type IVb isotherms are also observed in \n\nmaterials showing conical and cylindrical mesopores that are closed at the tapered end. \n\nType V isotherm form is similar to type III isotherm and this can be endorsed to quite weak \n\nadsorbent\u2013adsorbate interactions. These isotherms are archetypal for water adsorption on \n\nhydrophobic microporous and mesoporous adsorbents. \n\nThe reversible stepwise type VI isotherm is typically observed in highly uniform nonporous \n\nsurface materials due to layer-by-layer adsorption. The height of step denotes the capacity \n\nof each layer to adsorb, but the step sharpness is dependent on the system and the \n\ntemperature. This isotherm type is typically observed in the adsorption of argon or krypton \n\nin graphitized carbon blacks at low temperature. \n\nThe -196 \u00b0C N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms technique allows also to determine specific \n\nsurface area (SBET), size distribution of the pores and pore volume of the PMO materials.[16] \n\nPMO materials usually display type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) because of the \n\nnarrow distribution of pore sizes as typically observed for conventional mesoporous \n\nmaterials such as MCM-41. To calculate the specific surface area, the most used method is \n\nthe Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET),[17,18] and to determine the pore size distribution the \n\nKelvin equation is usually utilized.[16] For the specific case of mesoporous materials, the \n\npore size distribution is determined employing also the mathematic correction method KJS \n\n(Kruk, Jaroniec, and Sayari).[19,20] \n\nAdditionally, type I isotherms can be also observed in some of the PMO materials presented \n\nin the following chapters. The adsorption data of PMO materials displaying both mesopores \n\nand micropores can be treated with quenched solid classical density functional theory \n\n(QSDFT)[21] that is another method used to determine the pore size distribution. This method \n\nis better suited than the KJS one once it takes into account the effects of surface \n\nheterogeneity, which significantly improve the reliability of the pore size analysis of \n\nheterogeneous micro- and meso- porous materials.[18,22] \n\nN2 sorption isotherms were recorded at -196 \u00baC using a Gemini V 2.00 instrument model \n\n2380. Functionalized PMO materials were dehydrated overnight at 120 or 150 \u00baC to an \n\nultimate pressure of 1024 mbar and then cooled to room temperature prior to adsorption. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n56 \n\n \n\n2.4 Chemical studies \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy \n\nSolution and solid state NMR studies were made in order to obtain information of the \n\nchemical structure of the prepared bissilylated precursors and materials, respectively. \n\nDifferent chemical reactions were performed in this PhD Thesis in order to tune the \n\nproperties of the materials. The solid state NMR spectroscopy allows to observe the chemical \n\nenvironments of the different nuclei in the materials.[6\u20138] The appearance of peaks at different \n\nchemical shifts is expected when a chemical modification is introduced in the PMOs.

Despite being a quantitative technique, the acquisition of spectra with acceptable \n\nsignal to noise ratio, requires long time once the natural abundance of 29Si is of ? 4.7 %, \n\nwhich is quite low. 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra were acquired with a 4 \u00b5s 1H 90\u00b0 pulse, a \n\nCT of 8 ms, a ?R of 5 kHz and 5 s of RD. The 29Si CP-MAS NMR is just a qualitative \n\ntechnique because it involves the transference of polarization between 1H and 29Si nuclei. \n\nThe spectra are obtained in a short period of time with improved signal to noise ratio, being \n\nvery useful to clearly identify the chemical environments that can be quantified in the  \n29Si MAS NMR spectra. \n\nThe 13C and 29Si NMR spectra were quoted in ppm from trimethylsilane. \n\n15N CP-MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 4  \u00b5s 1H 90\u00b0 pulse, CT of 8 ms, a ?R of \n\n5 kHz and a RD of 5 s. These spectra took long time to be acquired due to the really low \n\nnatural abundance of 15N (?0.37%), resulting in a sensitive penalty. 15N NMR spectra were \n\nreferenced against a solid sample of natural abundance L-glycine, a secondary reference \n\nstandard with respect to nitromethane. \n\n27Al MAS NMR spectra were done employing a 10\u00ba flip angle pulse, a ?R of 14 kHz and RD \n\nof 1 s. In this case, a MAS quantitative technique was used due to the high natural abundance \n\nof 27Al, which is 100%, being the acquisition of the spectra much faster than in the cases \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\nThe FTIR spectroscopy is a versatile tool and was used here as a complementary technique \n\nto NMR for confirming the introduction of new functional groups into the PMO materials. \n\nThe FTIR generated spectra can be acquired through three different ways: \n\ntransmission/absorption, reflection and emission modes.[9] In the transmission/absorption \n\nmode, radiation goes through the sample, and some part of the radiation can be absorbed \n\nwhile another part can be transmitted. In reflection mode, the incident beam penetrates the \n\nsurface of the sample and interacts with the matrix and, after partial absorption of the \n\nradiation, returns to the surface. The emission mode, which is rarely used, consists in sample \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n58 \n\n \n\nheating in such a way that the functional groups of the sample can emit at characteristic \n\nwavelength.[9] The FTIR spectroscopy in reflectance mode was used throughout the different \n\nstudies in this PhD Thesis. Also, the transmission/absorption mode with attenuated total \n\nreflectance (ATR) technique was used. The ATR technique is usually associated with the \n\nacquisition of spectra of unwieldy samples, but its use has been spreading, because the \n\nspectra generated by this technique are obtained quickly in a wide range of samples without \n\nminimal preparation. \n\nThe typical FTIR spectroscopy absorption bands of the parent and of the functionalized \n\naromatic-PMO materials prepared in this PhD Thesis are presented in Table 2.2. \n\n \nTable 2.2.

The samples were dehydrated overnight at \n\n100 \u00b0C before analyses. \n\n \n\nElemental analysis \n\nEA enables the determination of the percentage of each atom in the PMO.[10,11] In this work, \n\nthis technique was extremely important i) for quantifying the amount of nitrogen species \n\nintroduced in the materials during the amination reactions via distinct synthesis conditions \n\nand ii) for attaining the amine densities. \n\nElemental analysis CHN were carried out with a TruSpec 630-200-200 CNHS Analyser. \n\nAnalysis Parameters: sample amount was between 1 and 2 mg; combustion furnace \n\ntemperature was 1075 \u00baC; afterburner temperature was 850 \u00baC.

M. S\u00e1 at Centro de Materiais da Universidade \n\ndo Porto (CEMUP), using a Kratos Axis Ultra HAS spectrometer, with monochromatized \n\nAl Eo radiation (15 eV). All the materials were compressed into pellets prior to the XPS \n\nstudies. In order to correct possible deviations, produced by electric charge of the materials, \n\nthe C 1s line at 285.0 eV was taken as internal standard. The percentage of each element into \n\nthe materials was determined from the areas of the relevant bands in the survey XPS spectra. \n\n \n\n2.5 Thermal stability studies \n\nThe thermal stability studies are important to extract information of the degradation \n\ntemperature of the materials.[13] This information is important to understand if the expected \n\nchemical functionalities were inserted in the material and to define the conditions to be used \n\nunder the different techniques to avoid material degradation. The desorption temperature \n\nused during the adsorption measurements took always into account the thermal stability of \n\neach material. To study the thermal stability of the materials, TGA analyses were performed \n\non a Shimadzu TGA-50 instrument with a program rate of 5 \u00baC\u00b7min-1 in air. \n\n \n\n2.6 CO2/CH4 adsorption studies \n\nThe adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured using two different \n\napparatuses, namely, the manometric and the volumetric one, as described below. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n60 \n\n \n\nManometric experimental setup \n\nAdsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured on PMO materials, at \n\n308 K and pressures up to 2 bar, using an in-house built manometric apparatus, Figure A1 \n\n(c.f. Appendix A). The samples were activated, according to the heating program shown in \n\nFigure A2 (first at 80 \u00b0C during 5 hours and then at 160 \u00b0C during 10 hours), under vacuum \n\nof ca. 14 mbar. The CO2 and CH4 gases were used as provided by Air Liquide (France), with \n\na purity of 99.998% and 99.95% respectively. \n\nThe experimental adsorption measurement technique adopted was previously described in \n\ndetail[23] and, therefore, is shortly summarized here. Before performing each adsorption \n\nmeasurement, the void volume was determined by helium picnometry. To perform an \n\nadsorption experiment, the gas to be adsorbed is fed into the gas tank until an initial pressure \n\nP is reached while the sample is kept isolated, in another tank, by a closed valve. After the \n\ngas feed, the pressure in the gas tank is allowed to stabilize over a given period of time.  \n\nThe adsorption process starts when the valve isolating the sample is opened, and a pressure \n\ndecrease is observed until a plateau is reached. Pressure and temperature readings are \n\nconstantly recorded over time, so that the adsorption uptake can be computed as a function \n\nof time. This procedure is repeated sequentially for different values of pressure, starting from \n\nthe previously equilibrated pressure point. \n\nEach experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted to a Langmuir model. \n\nThe fitting parameters were then used to calculate the Henry\u2019s constant of adsorption  \n\n(KH, in mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7bar-1) for each gas and each adsorbent by taking the slope of the isotherm \n\nin the limit of zero coverage. The Henry constant thus measures the affinity of each gas \n\ntoward the solid surface. The Langmuir equation is expressed in Equation 2.3: \n\n \n\n? =  \n?? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ?\n\n1 + ? \u00d7 ?\n (Equation 2.3) \n\n \nwhere q is the amount adsorbed, qS is the Langmuir saturation capacity, b is the Langmuir \n\nsurface affinity parameter and P is the pressure. \n\nWe then estimated the low-coverage CO2 selectivity (S) of each material by taking the ratio \n\nof the Henry\u2019s constants for the two gases (Equation 2.4): \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n61 \n\n \n\n??\n?/??? =\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n???\n=\n\n??\n?\n? \u00d7 ??\n?\n\n??\n??? \u00d7 ????\n\n (Equation 2.4) \n\n \nThe measurements made using this equipment were performed by our collaborators at the \n\nLaborato?rio Associado LSRE-LCM, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto,  \n\nChristophe Siquet, Jo\u00e3o Santos and Miguel Jorge. \n\n \nVolumetric experimental setup \n\nAdsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 on prepared samples were measured up to 1000 kPa \n\nat 25 \u00b0C, using the volumetric method. These experiments were done on a custom-made \n\nstainless steel volumetric apparatus, with a pressure transducer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, APR 266), \n\nand equipped with a vacuum system that allows a vacuum better than 10-2 Pa. The \n\ntemperature was controlled with a stirred thermostatic water bath (Grant Instrument, \n\nGD-120) and before every experiment the samples were degassed for 2.5 h at 150 \u00b0C. Each \n\nexperimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted using the virial model, where \n\nthe non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third virial \n\ncoefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the absolute \n\nadsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the density \n\nof the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using a \n\nmethod proposed by Myers[24] and the implementation is described in detail in previous \n\nworks.[25] The virial equation of state fitted to the adsorption data is in the form: \n\n \n\n( )33\n2\n\n21exp\nadsadsads\n\nH\n\nads\n\nnCnCnC\nK\n\nn\np ++=\n\n \n\n(Equation 2.5) \n\n \nwhere, KH is the Henry constant, and C1, C2, and C3 are the constants of the virial-series \n\nexpansion. \n\nThe CO2 and CH4 adsorption measurements made using this technique were performed \n\nunder supervision of Mois\u00e9s Pinto and Jo\u00e3o Pires at CCB \u2013 Center of Chemistry and \n\nBiochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n62 \n\n \n\n2.7 Computational studies \n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) is currently one of the most effective and also most \n\ncommon quantum mechanical methodologies to matter. Its applications go from atoms to \n\nmolecules and solids. Currently, DFT is regularly used for calculating a wide range of \n\nproperties in chemistry (e.g. molecular structures, reaction paths, etc.) and in physics  \n\n(e.g. band structures of solids). \n\nThe final aim of most approaches in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the \n\nresolution of the time-independent, non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation,[26] toward \n\nobtaining relevant information about a system. However, for non hydrogenoid species, a \n\nprecise solution of Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not possible and several approximations need to \n\nbe made. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation,[27] is the approximation most accepted, \n\nbeing centered on the fact that nuclei are several thousand times heavier than electrons, \n\ntherefore the system wave function is allowed to be fragmented into its electronic and nuclear \n\ncomponents. Then, for a system with many-electrons and assumed nuclear potential, the \n\nvariational principle describes a procedure to obtain its estimated ground-state energy and \n\nwave function, besides other important properties. \n\nTwo large classes of conventional electronic structure methods were developed to tackle \n\nmany-body problems and can be divided into wave function-based methods and DFT \n\nmethods. The former class comprise the often called ab initio approaches like the  \n\nHartree-Fock (HF), M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP), configuration interaction (CI), \n\nand coupled cluster (CC) methods.[28] For these methods, the system wave function with N \n\nelectrons depends on 3N spatial variables (and the spin in case of the unrestricted \n\nformalisms), and so their complexities grow with the increase of number of electrons. \n\nDifferently in the other class, DFT methods,[29] use functionals of the electron density, which \n\nis a function of only 3 spatial variables. \n\nThe DFT theory relies on the Hohenberg and Kohn (H-K) theorems. The first H-K theorem \n\nvalidates that the electron density exclusively controls the Hamiltonian operator and \n\nconsequently all the properties of the system, while the second theorem states that the \n\nfunctional relating to the ground-state energy of the system brings the lowest energy if and \n\nonly if the input density is the true ground state density (i.e. nothing but the variational \n\nprinciple). Currently, the precision and efficacy of DFT-based approaches depend not only \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n63 \n\n \n\non the basis-set for the expansion of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, but also on the quality of the \n\napplied exchange-correlation (XC) functionals.[30] \n\nThe first DFT approach proposed was the local density approximation (LDA)[31], which was \n\nfollowed by the local-spin density approximation (LSDA) proposed by Slater[32]. Both, \n\nfound vast application in physics but the consideration of an homogeneous electron density \n\nwas demonstrated to be inadequate (and inaccurate) for most applications in chemistry. \n\nThen, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) appeared, which has into account the \n\nnon-homogeneity of the true electron density, i.e, it incorporate also the gradient of the \n\nelectron density with the distance from the nucleus. Between the most frequently used \n\ncombinations of XC functionals of the GGA family are the BP86 (exchange from Becke\u2019s \n\nB88 functional with correlation from Perdew\u2019s P86 functional), PW91 (exchange-\n\ncorrelation from Perdew-Wang 91), PBE (exchange-correlation from Perdew, Burke, and \n\nErnzerhof), RPBE (revised version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional due to \n\nHammer and Norskov), and BLYP (B88 exchange with correlation from Lee, Yang and \n\nParr).[33\u201346] For example, the most applied functional to model metallic surfaces is the PW91, \n\nfollowed closely by PBE and RPBE.[47] GGA functionals usually provide better atomization \n\nenergies, and structural properties, when compared to LSDA functionals. Nevertheless, \n\nGGA functionals give too small barrier heights and fail in describing van der Waals \n\ninteractions. \n\nMore flexible XC functionals, labelled meta-GGAs (e.g. TPSS)[48,49] and hybrid (or meta-\n\nhybrid) functionals with nonlocal HF exchange[41] (e.g. hybrid B3LYP and meta hybrid \n\nM06) appeared to offer better accuracy, although they may present convergence problems. \n\nThey are also more computationally costly than approaches based on the GGA. \n\nIn order to solve the GGA limitations to describe systems where van der Waals interactions \n\n(vdW) assume an important role, i.e. weakly bonded systems, several different strategies \n\nhave been introduced in the last decade. In the case of DFT-D2, that is the approach used in \n\nthe PMO modeling studies performed in this PhD Thesis, it is considered a simple empirical \n\ndispersion correction, which was suggested by Grimme et al.,[50] where the dispersion \n\ncontributions are considered by pairwise interactions from the London formula.[51] Other \n\napproaches with different degrees of empiricism have been proposed to introduce the effects \n\nof dispersion in DFT calculations and were the focus of a recent review.[52] \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n64 \n\n \n\nBased on the description above, the choice of the most suitable DFT method for a specific \n\napplication is based on a compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Figure 2.6 \n\nillustrates the variation of the XC functional simplicity and expected accuracy on going from \n\nthe earth of Hartree (null exchange, null correlation) to the heaven of chemical accuracy, \n\nwith errors in energy differences lower than 1 kcal\u00b7mol-1; the green steps illustrate that the \n\ninclusion of dispersion corrections to any of the DFT classes in principle leads them closer \n\nto the heaven of accuracy in case of weakly bonded systems. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6.

Adapted from reference [54]. \n \n\nTherefore, if a DFT user climbs the ladder will get better accuracy at the expenses of a larges \n\ncomputational resources. Thus, for very accurate calculations, the DFT studies are limited \n\nto structural models of up to a few tens of atoms while standard DFT calculations (c.f. those \n\nusing approaches at the bottom of the ladder) can tackle much larger systems that can reach \n\nup to hundreds or a few thousands of atoms, when using standard computational systems. \n\nTwo approaches can be considered to model extended surfaces (which is the case in this PhD \n\nThesis): the so-called i) cluster model and ii) periodic slab model (c.f. sub-chapter 1.5).[55] \n\nThe results for a cluster model are critically dependent on the choice of the cluster size, \n\nstoichiometry and shape.

The infinite repetition \n\neliminates the limitations affecting the cluster models, i.e., the so-called border effects.  \n\nIn the periodic model approach, the computational cost is directly dependent on the number \n\n(size) and the symmetry of the elements in the unit cell. Bulk crystalline systems can be \n\nstudied with the periodical repetition of just a few atomic positions, e.g. by using their \n\nprimitive cells. The study of alloys, contaminants, or vacancies can be made by increasing \n\nthe model and substituting or removing one or more atoms in the periodic system. In the \n\nmethodologies repeating periodically in the three spatial dimensions a specific unit cell, the \n\nsurfaces of the materials can be generated by using a unit cell consisting of several layers of \n\nthe material (slab) and a vacuum region in the direction normal to the surface (Figure 2.7).  \n\nThis strategy has been considered to model an infinite wall of the PMO materials and to \n\nobtain atomic level information of their surface chemistry. Note, that for studying \n\nadsorption, the sizes of the slabs in the X and Y directions, assuming that the vacuum section \n\nis in the Z direction, are dependent on the volumes of the adsorbates and on the surface \n\ncoverage, i.e., larger unit cells have to be employed in the case of large adsorbates in order \n\nto avoid spurious adsorbate-adsorbate interactions with their images in the neighboring \n\nrepeated cells. By playing with the sizes of the slabs in the X and Y directions it is possible \n\nto simulate easily the effects of surface coverage. Also, the vacuum region in the Z direction \n\nmust be the smallest as possible to make the DFT computations feasible when plane-waves \n\nbasis sets are employed since these will be filling the entire unit cell space. Vacuum regions \n\nof ? 10 \u00c5 were found to sufficient to study small adsorbates but larger regions are required \n\nto study larger adsorbates. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n66 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.7.

I have also performed all the density functional theory calculations. The \n\nexperimental adsorption studies using a manometric apparatus were performed by \n\nChristophe Siquet, Jo\u00e3o Santos and Miguel Jorge at the University of Porto. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n73 \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Motivation \n\nAs it was seen in Sub-chapter 1.2 the biogas is a renewable energy source that is composed \n\nmainly by methane but presents also a large amount of carbon dioxide as the main \n\ncontaminant. It was also demonstrated the needs of removal CO2 from CH4 and the \n\ndrawbacks associated to the systems that are being employed to separate these gases. \n\nTherefore, an energy efficient process to uptake the CO2 contaminant from CH4 is required \n\nfor the wide application of biogas with the purpose of increasing the purity of the gaseous \n\nstream. It is well known that the adsorption process is a very attractive technique for small \n\nto medium-scale operations, but it relies on the availability of highly effective adsorbent \n\nmaterials. \n\nThe development of adsorbents to uptake the CO2 gas from biogas via adsorptive separation \n\ninvolves the preparation of materials with different nature and structure.[1] Various \n\nmesoporous and microporous adsorbents (carbons[2\u20136], MOFs[2,7,8], zeolites[2,9\u201313], clays[14,15], \n\nand silica-based mesoporous materials[16,17]) have been proposed for CO2 \n\nadsorption/separation from biogas as it was demonstrated in Sub-chapter 1.2. Although, \n\nthese adsorbents are still not ideal for CO2 uptake from biogas mainly due to their \n\nunsatisfactory performances. Thus, the ideal adsorbent is still undiscovered and, in an \n\nattempt to achieve a material with better ability to uptake CO2 from biogas, it is explored the \n\npossibility of applying periodic mesoporous phenylene-silicas (PMOs)[18\u201320] as adsorbents \n\nfor CO2/CH4 gas separation. The interest to use PMOs as adsorbents in this field relies in the \n\nassumption that these materials possess high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and \n\nare easy to be modified as it was possible to observe in Sub-chapter 1.4.[18\u201324] Additionally, \n\nPMOs also have the advantages of exhibiting meso- and molecular-scale periodicities that \n\ncan promote a good diffusion of the molecules (adsorbates but also the reagents required to \n\nmodify the PMOs) within the channels of the PMO because of the increased organization of \n\nthe pores and of the presence of the organic functions (such as ethylene, phenylene, \n\nbiphenylene, etc.) that are well integrated in the walls of this class of materials. Moreover, \n\nthe molecular-scale periodicity resulting from the alternating organic-inorganic groups along \n\nthe pore wall, assigns alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic character. Furthermore, it is \n\npossible to control the porosity of the PMOs using the template-assisted self-assembly \n\nmethod.[18\u201324] All of the features above increase the attractiveness of PMOs as potential \n\nadsorbents for CO2/CH4 adsorption/separation. Recently, alkyl amine functionalities (more \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n74 \n\n \n\nspecifically the N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-ethylenediamine) grafted on the silanols of \n\nphenylene-bridged PMO and of SBA-15 were tested in the adsorption of pure CO2 at 25 \u00b0C \n\nin a pressure range up to 1.2 atm.[25] It was observed that the alkyl amine-PMO adsorbs a \n\nlarger amount of CO2 at a faster adsorption rate when compared with SBA-15, which \n\ndemonstrates that the functionalization of PMOs with amines is more relevant than a similar \n\ndegree and nature of functionalization in silica for the adsorption of CO2. Interestingly, the \n\nunmodified SBA-15 silica also adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 when compared with the \n\nunmodified PMO. This behavior was explained by the higher hydrophobicity of the PMO \n\npore wall when compared with that of SBA-15. Hence, water adsorption is expected to be \n\nmore acute in SBA-15 than in PMO materials, competing more with CO2 for available \n\nadsorption sites on the former class of materials, so, organosilica instead of pure silica \n\nsupports were proposed for immobilization of amines groups aiming materials for CO2 \n\nadsorption/separation.[25] Despite the fact that PMOs are more expensive than silica, the \n\nsuperior ability of amine modified PMOs to adsorb CO2 can be transferred and should be \n\nexplored for these applications. \n\nHere, it is considered the phenylene-bridged PMOs as potential candidates for the CO2/CH4 \n\nseparation. In this way, phenylene-bridged PMO with different pore sizes were prepared by \n\nchanging the alkyl chain length of the cationic surfactant[26] since the pore size and pore \n\ncurvature may play an important role on the diffusion of the reagents or gas molecules inside \n\nthe pores. Additionally, the amount of amine functionalities into the materials, their locations \n\nand the type of silanols are certainly important variables on the adsorptive properties of these \n\nmaterials. So, after the synthesis of the PMOs, the mono-nitration of the phenylene bridges \n\nwas performed with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid. Then, the nitro group was \n\nreduced to the amine in the presence of tin chloride and hydrochloric acid.[27] To the best of \n\nour knowledge, the amination of the phenylene bridge in the PhCnPMOs with n &lt;18, was \n\nnot attempted before. Hence it is described for the first time the synthesis and \n\ncharacterization of aromatic amine-funtionalized PMOs with pore sizes ranging from 2.4 \n\nand 3.7 nm. All materials are tested on the CO2 and CH4 adsorption. The physicochemical \n\ncharacterization is performed to fully understand the potential of these materials for \n\nCO2/CH4 separation. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n75 \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Experimental section \n\nMaterials synthesis \n\nPhCnPMO adsorbents preparation: phenylene-bridged PMOs with different pore sizes \n\n(hereafter denoted PhCnPMOs, n = 12, 14, 16 or 18) were prepared following procedures \n\npreviously described in literature,[27,28] with slight modification in the amount of NaOH and \n\nsurfactant used (c.f. Table 3.1.1). The home-made 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene  \n\n(BTEB, c.f. Chapter 2.1) precursor[29] is hydrolyzed and condensed around a surfactant, the  \n\nCn-trimethylammonium bromide template (Cn-TMA, n =12, 14, 16 or 18), Figure 3.1.1. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.1. Synthesis route for PhCnPMOs, n = 12, 14, 16 and 18, prepared with C12-TMA,  \n\nC14-TMA, C16-TMA and C18-TMA surfactants, respectively. \n \n\nIn a typical synthesis of the PhCnPMO materials, the surfactant is dissolved in a mixture of \n\ndistilled water and 6 M aqueous sodium hydroxide at 20 \u2013 60 \u00b0C. BTEB was subsequently \n\nadded dropwise under vigorous stirring, at room temperature. The molar ratio BTEB: water \n\nis always constant and equal to 1 : 531 (molar ratio corresponding only to the distilled water), \n\nwith the quantities of surfactant and NaOH adjusted according to the surfactant used  \n\n(c.f. Table 3.1.1).  \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.1.

The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature, and was \n\nthen transferred into a Teflon lined autoclave for additional 24 hours at 100 \u00b0C. The final \n\nprecipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with warm distilled water and dried at \n\n60 \u00b0C. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n76 \n\n \n\nTo obtain porous PMO materials, the surfactants were removed through solvent \n\nextraction.[18\u201320,26,28] An aliquot of 0.5 g of the as-synthesized powder was stirred in a \n\nsolution of 4.5 g of 37% HCl and 125 mL ethanol, for 8 hours at 80 \u00b0C. The powder was \n\nfiltered off, washed with ethanol and water and dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C. The confirmation \n\nof the template removal was made through 13C NMR spectroscopy and TGA analysis. \n\nNH2PhCnPMO adsorbents preparation: the amine phenylene-modifications (to prepare \n\nNH2PhCnPMO, n =12, 14, 16 or 18) were made using the same two-step procedure reported \n\nby Inagaki et al.[27] First a strong acid treatment with HNO3/H2SO4 was used to incorporate \n\nthe nitro groups into the phenylene moieties of PMO followed by treatment with SnCl2/HCl \n\nto reduce the nitro groups to the desired amine functionalities (Figure 3.1.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.2. Synthesis route for the amine functionalization of the PhCnPMOs, n=12, 14, 16 and \n18. \n \n\nMaterials characterization \n\nAll PMO materials were evaluated by PXRD, -196 \u00b0C N2-sorption isotherms and TEM. The \n\nchemical properties of the materials were evaluated by elemental analysis, 13C, 15N and 29Si \n\nNMR and FTIR spectroscopies. The thermal stability was evaluated by TGA. The  \n\nN2-sorption isotherms, TEM, 13C CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, TGA, EA and CO2 and CH4 \n\nadsorption data are available in the Appendix A. \n\n \nAdsorption measurement procedure \n\nAdsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured on as-synthesized and \n\namine-modified PMO materials, at 308 K and pressures up to 2 bar, using an in-house built \n\nmanometric apparatus, using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6.  \n\nEach experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted to a Langmuir model. \n\nThe fitting parameters were then used to calculate the Henry\u2019s constant of adsorption (KH, \n\nin mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7bar-1) for each gas and each adsorbent by taking the slope of the isotherm in the \n\nlimit of zero coverage. The Henry constant thus measures the affinity of each gas toward the \n\nsolid surface. The Langmuir equation is expressed in Equation 3.1.1: \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n77 \n\n \n\n? =  \n?? \u00d7 ? \u00d7 ?\n\n1 + ? \u00d7 ?\n (Equation 3.1.1) \n\n \nwhere q is the amount adsorbed, qS is the Langmuir saturation capacity, b is the Langmuir \n\nsurface affinity parameter and P is the pressure. \n\nWe then estimated the low-coverage CO2 selectivity (S) of each material by taking the ratio \n\nof the Henry\u2019s constants for the two gases (Equation 3.1.2): \n\n \n\n\n??\n/??? =\n??\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n???\n=\n\n??\n??\n \u00d7 ???\n\n??\n??? \u00d7 ????\n\n (Equation 3.1.2) \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Results and discussion  \n\nCharacterization of materials \n\nThe structural order of the non-modified samples was studied by PXRD. Figure 3.1.3a shows \n\nthe PXRD patterns of surfactant-free PhC12PMO, PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO \n\nsamples. The patterns are in agreement with those reported in previous studies,[26,28] being \n\ncompatible with a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice. The d spacing of \n\nthe strong low-angle (100) reflection changes slightly from sample to sample. The lattice \n\nparameters, a, calculated from the 2? values of the (100) peaks for the surfactant-free \n\nPhC12PMO, PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO materials are 4.14; 4.32; 4.76; and  \n\n5.36 nm, respectively (Table 3.1.2). The increase of the lattice parameters results in larger \n\npore sizes (Figure 3.1.3d) as a function of the alkyl-tail lengths. The evidence for the \n\nhexagonal arrangement of the pores is obtained from the presence of the tiny (110) and (200) \n\nlow-angle reflections observed in Figure 3.1.3a.[26,28] In addition to the low-angle peaks, the \n\nPXRD patterns display medium-range reflection at d ~ 0.76 nm, due to molecular-scale \n\nperiodicity in the PMO pore walls along the channel direction.[28] \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.3. PXRD patterns of the: a) PhCnPMOs; b) and c) NH2PhCnPMOs.

The structural order \n\nof the aminated samples was studied by PXRD and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. \n\nFigure 3.1.3b and c shows the PXRD patterns of NH2PhCnPMO materials. As in the simple \n\nPMOs, the first strong low-angle (100) reflection peak associated to the (110) and (200) \n\nsmall reflections are characteristic of a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) \n\nlattice, Figures 3.1.3b and c. Thus, the hexagonal arrangement is maintained upon amination. \n\nThe d spacings in the aminated samples are similar to the d spacings of the pristine PMOs. \n\nThe lattice parameters, a, of the hexagonal array of mesopores obtained for the \n\nNH2PhC12PMO, NH2PhC14PMO, NH2PhC16PMO and NH2PhC18PMO materials are 4.19, \n\n4.37, 4.88 and 5.34 nm, respectively, which means that the presence of the amino group does \n\nnot significantly change those values relatively to the pristine materials (Table 3.1.2). In \n\naddition to the low-angle peaks, the PXRD patterns of all aminated samples display medium-\n\nrange reflections at d ~ 0.760 \u00b1 0.002 nm, which are identical to those of the initial PMO \n\n1 3 5\n\n2?

Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra support the amination of PhCnPMOs \n\nmaterials. The pristine materials present a typical resonance at 133 ppm of the aromatic \n\ncarbons as reported in the literature.[28] Tiny peaks can be detected in the region 0 to 50 ppm \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n80 \n\n \n\nin the spectra of PhC18PMO sample, which are associated to the residual presence of non-\n\nextracted template molecules. These resonances are not observed in the spectra of the other \n\nPhCnPMOs. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of NH2PhCnPMO materials exhibit resonances \n\nat ca. 122, 133 and 150 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons of the phenylene ring. These values \n\nare in agreement with the results previously reported for the NH2PhC18PMO.[27]  \n\nThe 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PhCnPMO and NH2PhCnPMO exhibit peaks at ca.  \n\n-81, -70 and -61 ppm attributed to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous species  \n\n [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m], respectively, which are illustrated in Figure 3.1.4. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.4. 29Si CP-MAS and MAS NMR spectra of PhCnPMOs and NH2PhCnPMO.

The success of the \n\namination of the phenylene moieties in the PMOs was also verified by Fourier infrared \n\ntransform (FTIR) spectroscopy, Figure A1.6 (Appendix A). \n\nFigure A1.7 (Appendix A) presents the TGA analysis of the pristine and amine modified  \n\nPhCnPMOs. The first weight loss observed below 100 \u00b0C is related to desorption of \n\nphysisorbed water. No weight loss from 100 to 300 \u00b0C, which is due to the small quantity of \n\nremained surfactant, was detected for pure PMOs with exception of PhC18PMO (2% weight \n\nloss), confirming the 13C CP-MAS NMR results. The decomposition and release of the \n\norganic moieties from the framework takes place above 600 \u00b0C in the parent PhCnPMOs. \n\nThe introduction of the amino groups in the PMOs leads to a reduction of thermal stability \n\nfrom 600 to 400 \u00b0C for all NH2PhCnPMOs as observed by TGA, Figure A1.7 (Appendix A). \n\nTable A1.2 (Appendix A) displays the density of the amino group linked to the phenylene \n\nmoieties into the PMOs materials. The PMO with the smallest pore size presents the lowest \n\ndensity of NH2 groups. This probably occurs as a consequence of steric hindrance during the \n\nfunctionalization. \n\n \nExperimental pure-component adsorption isotherms \n\nPure-component adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 at 35 \u00b0C on the PhC12PMOs, shown \n\nin terms of absolute amount adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent (q), are displayed in  \n\nFigure 3.1.5. The introduction of the amino group into the channels of the PhC12PMO leads \n\nto an increase in the adsorption of CO2 (uppermost curves in Figure 3.1.5). Additionally, the \n\nadsorption of methane in the NH2PhC12PMO is slightly lower than in the as-synthesized \n\nmaterial (lowermost curves in Figure 3.1.5). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.5. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms of pure CO2 (closed symbols) and CH4 (open \nsymbols) molecules in the as-synthesized (squares) and amine functionalized (spheres) PhC12PMOs. \nSolid lines represent the fits to Langmuir model. \n \n\nTable 3.1.3 depicted the calculated Henry\u2019s constants of adsorption for pure CO2 and CH4 \n\nmolecules in the pristine and amine functionalized PhCnPMOs adsorbents. Considering the \n\nlow CH4 adsorption values obtained for all prepared PMOs, it is possible to generalize that \n\nthese materials are weak CH4 adsorbents. Additionally, the amination in the PhC12PMO \n\nprovides an improvement in the adsorption of the material. It should be emphasized that this \n\nevidence is not observed for all PhCnPMOs. The amination of the PhCnPMOs is favoring \n\nthe adsorption of CO2 in the case of the materials with the smallest pores such as \n\nNH2PhC12PMO and NH2PhC14PMO (Figure 3.1.5, Figure A1.8 and Table 3.1.3), while an \n\nopposite effect is observed in the materials with the largest pore sizes (c.f. NH2PhC16PMO \n\nand NH2PhC18PMO). A systematic analysis of the features of these materials is necessary to \n\nunderstand other reasons besides pore size and BET surface area factors that may be \n\ninfluencing the adsorption profiles recorded in this work. \n\nThe Henry\u2019s constants of PhC18PMO, PhC16PMO, Ph C14PMO and PhC12PMO for CO2 are \n\n0.40, 0.48, 0.41 and 0.46 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7bar-1 respectively (Table 3.1.3). As it can be seen, these \n\nvalues seem to be fairly independent of the pore size. Although the size of the pores can \n\ninfluence the distance between functional groups and, consequently, the Henry\u2019s constants, \n\nit is often observed that in materials with large pores, low-coverage adsorption is dominated \n\nby surface chemistry. As such, the variation of KH may be related with the concentration of \n\nsilanols (T1 and T2 species, Figure 3.1.4), phenylene density and nitrogen density (in the case \n\nof the amine functionalized PhCnPMOs) of each material.

The \n\npercentages of nitrogen and carbon were taken directly from elemental analyses. The \n\npercentage of silanol species was calculated from 29Si MAS NMR by deconvolution of the \n\nT1 and T2 species in the NMR spectrum of each material (denoted as T1NMR and T2NMR, Table \n\nA1.1, Appendix A). As the percentages of siliceous and of oxygen species vary from sample \n\nto sample, the Tm siliceous species percentages were converted to the percentages of Tm \n\nsiliceous species present in the sample (denoted here as T1SMP and T2SMP) by combining the \n\nNMR results with the elemental analysis data. It is hypothesized that the CO2 molecules \n\ninteract more favorably with the T1 and T2 siliceous species in each sample. Therefore, the \n\ntotal percentage of siliceous species (denoted here as %Si-O) of each material (Table A1.2, \n\nAppendix A) was calculated using the following Equation 3.1.3: \n\n \n%Si-O = %Si + %O = 100% - (%N + %C + %H)    (Equation 3.1.3) \n\n \nTable 3.1.3.

Then, the percentage of TmNMR species was multiplied by the percentage \n\nof Si-O to obtain %TmSMP. The evident correlation between the percentage of Tm species in \n\neach sample and the corresponding KHCO2 values supports the hypothesis raised above.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n84 \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the data in Table 3.1.3 shows that the presence of T2 silanol species in the \n\nPMO is correlated with the amount of adsorbed CO2, i.e., in general the KHCO2 augments \n\nwith the increase of %T2SMP. \n\nThis observation is consistent with a picture that the presence of 29Si T2 silanol species in \n\nthe PMO brings a positive effect on the adsorption of CO2 by creating hydrogen bonds with \n\nthe acidic CO2. Curiously, KHCO2 reduces with the increase of the percentage of the silanediol \n\nspecies, i.e., with the amount of silanols with T1 environments (c.f. Figure 3.1.4). This \n\nsuggests that when two hydroxyl groups are linked to the same silicon atom, they are very \n\nprobably establishing intramolecular bonds of the type O\u2013H.\u2026O,[31] hence, less Si\u2013O\u2013H \n\nmoieties are available to interact with CO2. As the T1 species content in the different PMO \n\nis inversely proportional to the T2 species content (c.f. Table A1.1, 1st and 2nd column), the \n\namount of adsorbed CO2 by each PMO is influenced mainly by the number of basic T2 silanol \n\nspecies. The correlation between the percentage of T2SMP silanol on each sample and the \n\nHenry constants is presented in Figure A1.9a. \n\nThe CO2 molecules can also interact with the organic moieties but such interaction is \n\nexpected to be much weaker than that with the silanol species. In fact, Martinez et al.[32] \n\nfound through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the adsorption energy \n\nbetween CO2 and silanols with the T2 environment was twice that occurring between CO2 \n\nand the organic bridges. Preliminary DFT calculations (PBE-D2 level of theory) employing \n\na computational recipe and a PMO model similar to those used by Martinez et al.[32] show \n\nthat CO2 is positioned close to a T2 silanol species in the pristine PMO material, as can be \n\nobserved in Figure 3.1.6a. Although at low pressure it is not expected interaction between \n\nthe organic bridges and CO2 molecules, the presence of the organic moieties may contribute \n\nto enhance the interaction of CO2 with the T2 silanols by interrupting long range hydrogen \n\nbond interaction within silanols. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n85 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 3.1.6. CO2 preferential location on a) PhCnPMOs and b) NH2PhCnPMOs. The CO2 is \nhighlighted in yellow. \n \n\nTherefore, at low pressure, the CO2 molecules interact only with available silanols on the \n\nsurface of the materials while regions close to the organic moieties will be populated only at \n\nhigh pressure. Based on these premises, it is tentatively defined a correlation equation \n\n(Equation 3.1.4) that may represent the number of CO2 preferential adsorption sites in the \n\nnon-aminated PMO materials, fOH, as: \n\n \nfOH ? %T2SMP / %C (Equation 3.1.4) \n\n \nwhere %T2SMP and %C correspond to the percentages of T2 silanols and carbon atoms on the \n\nPMO material. The %C appears as uniformed weight factor of the materials. The fOH values \n\nfor the non-aminated PMOs are compared in Table 3.1.4 with the Henry constants for the \n\ncorresponding materials. Interestingly, the ordering of the calculated fOH values is identical \n\nto that of the Henry\u2019s constants of pure CO2. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.4.

Moreover, the aminated phenylene \n\nmotifs interact much more strongly with CO2 molecules than the bare phenylene moieties. \n\nThus, the aminated PhCnPMOs present different degrees of hydrophobicity and different \n\ndegrees of acidity in the same material when compared with the pristine materials. \n\nAdditionally, different interactions between amino groups, silanol species and phenylene \n\nmoieties can occur due to the distribution of the amino groups on the walls of the materials. \n\nThese factors increase the degree of complexity in the determination of fOH. Still, DFT \n\ncalculations (Sub-chapter 3.2) for the adsorption of CO2 on a periodic model of the walls of \n\nthe aminated phenylene PMO, derived from the model developed by Mart\u00ednez et al.[32] by \n\nsubstitution of a phenyl hydrogen atom with an amino group, show that the CO2 adsorbate \n\ninteracts preferentially with the isolated T2 silanol species, in a bridging configuration where \n\nit also interacts with a neighboring amino group (c.f. Figure 3.1.6b). So, the main difference \n\nto the corresponding non-aminated PMOs is the strength of the interaction, which is slightly \n\nhigher in the aminated materials than in the pristine PMOs. In principle, this simultaneous \n\ninteraction of the CO2 with silanols and amino groups will have a greater probability of \n\noccurrence in materials having smaller pore sizes, because the pore curvature is expected to \n\nallow these two functional groups to be closer to each other than in the materials with larger \n\npore sizes. Positively, our assumptions seem to be supported by the b affinity parameters \n\n(Table A1.3, Appendix A), which are found to only increase upon amination in the case of \n\nthe C12 materials, to be similar in the case of C14 PMOs, and to decrease in the cases of the \n\nC16 and C18 materials. So, in the case of the materials with the largest pore sizes, the \n\ncoefficient related to the affinity between the sorbent and the sorbate decreases upon the \n\namination reaction. Thus, it can be approximated that, at low pressure, the number of sites \n\nfor CO2 adsorption in the aminated samples is identical to the number of T2 type silanols.  \n\nIn fact, as it can be seen in Figure A1.8b, the percentage of T2SMP silanol types on the \n\naminated samples is correlated with the values of the Henry constants. In this way,  \n\nEquation 3.1.4 can also be used to calculate the number of CO2 preferential adsorption sites \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n87 \n\n \n\nin the aminated PMO materials. The calculated fOH values for the NH2PhCnPMOs materials \n\nare compared in Table 3.1.5 with the Henry\u2019s constants of pure CO2. \n\n \nTable 3.1.5. Correlation of chemical properties with the calculated low-coverage adsorption \ncapacities of pure CO2 for the NH2PhCnPMOs adsorbents. \n\nPMO \nfOH \n\n(%T2 / %C) \nKHCO2 \n\n(mmol?g-1?bar-1) \n\nNH2PhC18PMO 0.43 0.34 \n\nNH2PhC16PMO 0.46 0.42 \n\nNH2PhC14PMO 0.55 0.47 \n\nNH2PhC12PMO 0.65 0.56 \n \n\nEncouragingly, as found for the as-synthesized materials, the latter quantities are in excellent \n\nqualitative agreement, again suggesting that the amounts of adsorbed CO2 in these materials \n\nare correlated with the percentages of T2 silanols divided by the % of carbon determined by \n\nEA, which is a normalizing factor. As expected, the discrepancies between the two quantities \n\nare larger in the aminated materials than in the as-synthesized ones because of the \n\nheterogeneous distribution of the amino groups and of possible formation of structural \n\ndefects upon the amination reaction. Once again, the adsorption of carbon dioxide at low \n\npressure in materials displaying a large variety of organic and inorganic adsorption sites can \n\nbe described by a very simple correlation (Equation 3.1.4). This observation is a convincing \n\nsign of the local nature of the adsorption mechanism, which involves a quite limited number \n\nof surface atoms, and it is in agreement with recent theoretical studies on these materials.[32] \n\n \nComparison to other materials \n\nThe capacity of NH2PhC12PMO to capture carbon dioxide and methane is compared in Table \n\n3.1.6 with the capacities reported in the literature for other classes of adsorbents, namely, \n\nmetal organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs), silicas, \n\ncarbons and clays. Notice that data were determined at different temperatures with \n\nconcomitant effects on the values of the capacities. For instance, in the case of the MAC \n\n(microwave activated carbon) material, a 20% reduction in the CO2 capacity is found on \n\nincreasing temperature from 25 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C. A similar reduction (of 27%) was also found \n\nfor the PhC18PMO when enhancing the temperature from 25 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C. Although, the ratio \n\nof adsorption capacity of CO2/CH4 is improved with this increase of temperature. The results \n\nobtained for the PMO materials in this work were obtained at the 35 \u00b0C and a pressure of  \n\n1 bar. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n88 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.6. Capacities of different adsorbents in the CO2/CH4 separation at 1 bar. \n\n \n\nThe data in Table 3.1.6 show that the capacity of the NH2PhC12PMO material to adsorb \n\neither CO2 or CH4 is quite low when compared to the other materials, but the ratio between \n\nthe capacities for CO2 and CH4 is among the best. Importantly, the capacity to adsorb \n\nmethane is very low which may be seen as very convenient for separation processes. If one \n\ncompares the ratios of the capacities for capturing the two gases by different materials \n\nreported in literature with our best material (NH2PhC12PMO), measured at the same \n\ntemperature and pressure (35 \u00b0C, 1 bar), it is possible to verify that the NH2PhC12PMO \n\nmaterial presents a relatively high capacity ratio, being superior than both MAC and \n\nactivated carbon, 5.8 versus 2.1 and 2.3, respectively. Additionally, the capacity ratio of \n\nNH2PhC12PMO is similar to those obtained in most of zeolites presented in Table 3.1.6 at \n\nthe same working conditions, showing that PMO materials incorporating different \n\nfunctionalities can be good candidates for CO2/CH4 separation processes. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nType Materials \nCO2 capacity \n\n(mmol\u00b7g-1) \nCH4 capacity \n\n(mmol\u00b7g-1) \nTemperature \n\n??2 ????????\n\n??4 ????????\n \n\nCarbons \nMAC[6] \n\n2.13 0.98 25 \u00b0C 2.2 \n\n1.69 0.81 \n35 \u00b0C \n\n2.1 \n\nActivated Carbon[33] ?2.1 ?0.9 2.3 \n\nClays PILC Alw[15] ?0.40 ?0.07 \n\n25 \u00b0 \n\n5.7 \n\nMOFs \n\nMOF-14(Cu)[34] ?2.50 ?1.00 2.5 \n\nCPO-27-Ni[35] ?7.50 ?4.38 1.7 \n\nCPO-27-Mg[35] ?8.75 ?4.29 2.0 \n\namino-MIL-53(Al)[36] 1.96 ?0.30 30 \u00b0C 6.5 \n\nSilicas a-MCMBs[4] 1.97 1.23 25 \u00b0C 1.6 \n\nZeolites \n\nand ZIFs \n\nH?-zeolite[37] 1.76 0.38 \n30 \u00b0C \n\n4.6 \n\nNa?-zeolite[37] ?2.80 ?0.70 4.0 \n\nZIF-7[38] 2.34 0.13 25 \u00b0C 18.0 \n\nT-type zeolite[39] ?1.90 ?0.30 \n\n35 \u00b0C \n\n6.3 \n\nLiX zeolite[33] ?3.90 ?0.69 5.7 \n\n13X zeolite[10] ?4.08 ?0.50 8.2 \nChabazite zeolite \n\n(r2KCHA)[40] \n?3.70 ?1.10 3.4 \n\nPMOs \nPhC18PMO \n\n0.49 0.11 25 \u00b0C 4.5 \n\n0.36 0.07 \n35 \u00b0C \n\n5.1 \n\nNH2PhC12PMO 0.46 0.08 5.8 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n89 \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Conclusions \n\nTo summarize, amine-modified phenylene PMOs with different pore sizes were successfully \n\nsynthetized and characterized. All pristine and amine-modified phenylene PMO materials \n\nshowed two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice and molecular-scale \n\nperiodicities observed by PXRD and TEM. It was evaluated the performance of the materials \n\non adsorption of pure carbon dioxide and methane at 35 \u00b0C at low pressure. The adsorption \n\nof CO2 was much higher than that of CH4, anticipating high CO2 selectivity. Direct \n\ncorrelations between the amounts of CO2 adsorbed and material pore sizes or specific surface \n\nareas were not found. In order to understand the differences obtained for the CO2 adsorption \n\nwithin all materials, the Henry\u2019s constants of adsorption were determined, as well as their \n\nchemical features. A simple expression considering the % of T2SMP silanol species was found \n\nto provide a good prediction of the experimental Henry\u2019s law constants for pure CO2 \n\nadsorption on each material. The adsorbent with the best chemical features to adsorb CO2 \n\nwas the NH2PhC12PMO, presenting a Henry constant of 0.56 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7bar-1 at 35 \u00b0C. \n\nHowever, the corresponding Henry constant for CH4 is extremely low (0.06 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7bar-1 \n\nat 35 \u00b0C), turning it potentially interesting for the separation of this gas from CO2. \n\nPMOs can be used as adsorbents with improved characteristics for CO2 \n\nadsorption/separation from CH4 at low pressure. For that, they should present high degree \n\nof silica condensation (high amounts of T2 silanols and small quantities of T1 silanols). In \n\naddition, the pore sizes and BET surfaces seem not to play a direct role on the adsorption \n\ncapacities, our results may indicate the existence of an indirect relation. Thus, the pore size \n\nshould affect the curvature of the pore, the degree of condensation and thus the silanol type \n\ncontent. This information may be used in the future to design more effective functionalized \n\nPMO materials for biogas upgrading.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n90 \n\n \n\n3.2 Interaction of CO2 and CH4 with functionalized periodic mesoporous \n\nphenylene\u2013silica: Periodic DFT calculations and gas adsorption \n\nmeasurements \n\n \n\n \n\nAdapted from: \n\nMirtha A.

I also carried out the experimental CO2 and CH4 pure \n\nadsorption using a volumetric apparatus under guidance of Mois\u00e9s L. Pinto and Jo\u00e3o Pires \n\n(University of Lisbon). The experimental adsorption studies using a manometric apparatus \n\nwere performed at the University of Porto by Christophe Siquet, Jo\u00e3o Santos and Miguel \n\nJorge. The NMR studies were performed at the University of Aveiro by Mariana Sardo and \n\nLu\u00eds Mafra. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n91 \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Motivation \n\nHaving into account the strong need for a major breakthrough in finding an optimal \n\nadsorbent for the CO2/CH4 separation, the chemical modification of the benzene moieties in \n\nthe PMO framework with, for instance, basic amino groups, can be accomplished to optimize \n\ntheir features for the separation of these gases, i.e., by enhancing interactions with one of the \n\ngases.[25] These functional groups can additionally display interesting synergistic effects in \n\nmaterials that already exhibit high ?-? conjugation and mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic \n\ncharacter. \n\nOur main aim in this work is to introduce amine modifications in PhPMO in order to \n\nincrement the interactions with CO2 without improving those with CH4 gases. This strategy \n\nwill improve the potential of these materials to separate CO2/CH4 mixtures, i.e., making these \n\nmaterials candidates for biogas upgrading. As it was described and understood in  \n\nSub-chapter 3.1, the amination of the PhPMO (NH2PhPMO) is only effective on materials \n\nwith small pore size, improving the affinity to the CO2 gas. In the present work, non-\n\nfunctionalized (PhC12PMO) and amine functionalized PhC12PMOs (NH2PhC12PMO), \n\nhaving pore sizes of approximately 2.5 nm, were synthesized following the strategy reported \n\nin Sub-chapter 3.1. Two additional materials, i.e., APTMS@PhC12PMO and \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO, were obtained by post-grafting 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane \n\n(APTMS) into the PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO materials. Thus, different kinds of amines \n\nwere incorporated into the PhC12PMO through two different methodologies. Theoretical and \n\nexperimental gas adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the affinities of these \n\nmaterials towards CO2 and CH4, and to understand the interactions between the materials\u2019 \n\nfunctional groups and these two gases. To the best of our knowledge only a single previous \n\nexperimental study describes the grafting of the APTMS to the free silanols of the \n\nPhC12PMO, but the resulting material (APTMS@PhC12PMO) presented large pore sizes and \n\nwas only tested in the adsorption of CO2.[25] Similarly, few theoretical studies of PMOs were \n\npublished in the literature,[22] and none of them evaluate phenylene bridge or silanol \n\nfunctionalized PMO materials for gas adsorption/separation. After validation of the \n\ncomputational approach, additional calculations were performed to predict if other \n\nfunctional groups, e.g. \u2013NO2, \u2013SO3H, \u2013NH(iPr) and \u2013CH2NH2, were also effective in \n\npromoting selective interactions with CO2. The results of our study highlight the potential of \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n92 \n\n \n\na synergistic approach involving theory and experiment to guide the rational design of \n\nmaterials for gas separation applications. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Experimental and computational details \n\nSynthesis of PMOs. \n\nThe syntheses of PhC12PMO and the NH2PhC12PMO are described in Sub-chapter 3.1.2. The \n\nmaterials APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO were obtained from \n\nPhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO, respectively, as can be observed in Figure 3.2.1. To prepare \n\nthe APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials, 1 g of PhC12PMO and \n\nNH2PhC12PMO were dried at 80 \u00b0C under vacuum atmosphere during 3 h. After the \n\nactivation of the pores, dry dichloromethane (10 mL) was added and \n\n(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (0.439 g) was added drop wise to the suspension. The \n\nmixtures were vigorously stirred for 48 h. The obtained materials were filtered off and \n\nfurther washed with a large amount of distilled water and dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C overnight. \n\nThe APTMS post-grafting reaction was repeated for two additional cycles. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.1. Functionalization of PhC12PMO material with amino groups. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n93 \n\n \n\nCharacterization of PMOs. \n\nThe structural order and the textural physical properties of all PMO materials were evaluated \n\nby PXRD, -196 \u00b0C N2-sorption isotherms and TEM. 29Si MAS NMR and 13C and  \n29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra were collected to check the stability of the Si-C bonds in the \n\nPMOs and to verify the chemical structure of the organic bridge, respectively. FTIR \n\nspectroscopy was also used to verify the chemical bonds of all prepared PMOs. The nitrogen \n\ndensity was determined by EA. PXRD, N2\u2013sorption isotherms, 29Si NMR, FTIR, TGA and \n\nEA and some other data is presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\nGas adsorption details. \n\nAdsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 on prepared samples were measured up to 1000 kPa \n\nat 25 \u00b0C, using the volumetric method, using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6. \n\nEach experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted using the Virial model, \n\nwhere the non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third \n\nvirial coefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the \n\nabsolute adsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the \n\ndensity of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using \n\na method proposed by Myers[41] and the implementation is described in detail in previous \n\nworks.[15] The virial equation of state fitted to the adsorption data is in the form: \n\n( )33\n2\n\n21exp\nadsadsads\n\nH\n\nads\n\nnCnCnC\nK\n\nn\np ++=\n\n \n(Equation 3.2.1) \n\n \nwhere KH is the Henry constant, and C1, C2, and C3 are the constants of the virial-series \n\nexpansion. \n\nAdsorption isotherms of pure CO2 and CH4 were also measured on as-synthesized and \n\namine-modified PMO materials at 35 \u00b0C and pressures up to 200 kPa using an in-house built \n\nmanometric apparatus. The samples were activated first at 80 \u00b0C during 5 h and then at  \n\n160 \u00b0C during 10 h, under vacuum of ca. 1.4 kPa. The CO2 and CH4 gases were used as \n\nprovided by Air Liquide (France), with a purity of 99.998% and 99.95%, respectively. The \n\nexperimental adsorption measurements technique adopted was also previously described.[30] \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n94 \n\n \n\nDFT calculations. \n\nPeriodic slab calculations were performed with the VASP computer code.[42\u201344] DFT \n\ncalculations considered the PBE exchange-correlation functional,[45] based on the GGA. The \n\nnon-spin polarized DFT calculations include a correction for the van der Waals interactions \n\naccording to the D2 method proposed by Grimme using the default parameters.[46\u201348] The \n\nsuitability of the PBE-D2 approach is supported by results in a previous study where the \n\ncalculated adsorption energy for CO with PhPMO (-14.3 kJ\u00b7mol-1)[32] was found to be in \n\nclose agreement with the experimental adsorption enthalpy (-13.2 kJ\u00b7mol-1)[24] obtained from \n\nvariable temperature infrared (VTIR) spectroscopy and with the range of binding energies \n\ncalculated with the B3LYP-D approach for CO interacting with cluster models.[22,24] Valence \n\nelectrons were described by plane-wave basis sets and core electrons with projector-\n\naugmented wave (PAW) potentials.[49] A kinetic energy cutoff of 415 eV was used. The \n\natomic positions in the supercells used to model the walls of the different PMO materials \n\nwere fully relaxed with the quasi-Newton algorithm, and the stopping-criteria for electronic \n\nand ionic updates were 10-7 eV and -0.05 eV/\u00c5, respectively. Dipole corrections in the \n\ndirection perpendicular to the PMO wall were applied. \n\nThe cell dimensions and the atomic coordinates for the structural model of the walls in the  \n\nPhPMO material were kindly provided by Mart\u00ednez and Pacchioni.[32] The structure is shown \n\nin Figure 3.2.2 and corresponds to a sequence of six and four member rings of organosilica \n\ntetrahedra with T3 to T2 [Tm=RSi(OH)(3-m)(OSi)m, in which R represents an organic group] \n\nsilicon environments in a ratio of 2:1, grounded on information from solid state NMR \n\nobtained by Comotti et al.[50] Notice that Mart\u00ednez and Pacchioni[32] considered also a \n\nstructural model of the walls of the nanopores based on a sequence of six member rings only, \n\nwith T3 to T2 in a ratio of 1:1, derived from the three-dimensional periodic lattice having the \n\nplanes of the aromatic rings parallel to each other reported by Inagaki et al.[28], but found the \n\nformer structure, with non-planar benzene moieties, to be more stable (~ 30 kJ\u00b7mol-1 per \n\nformula unit) than the latter. Important for the discussion below is the fact that the adsorption \n\nenergy of CO2 \u2013 either in the model with six and four member rings or with six rings only \u2013 \n\nis about 50% larger than that corresponding to CH4. Thus, the information obtained with one \n\nor the other model is expected to be qualitatively similar. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n95 \n\n \n\n    \n\nFigure 3.2.2. Side (left) and top (right) views of the unit cell (inline) used to model the PhPMO \nmaterial with fully-optimized atomic positions. Color code for atomic spheres is: H, white; C, grey; \nO, red; and Si, pink. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.3. Functionalization of the PhPMO by post-modification, i.e., by replacement of a single \nH atom in the aromatic rings with an R group (R = NH2, NO2, NH-i-Pr, CH2NH2 and SO3H) and by \ngrafting, i.e., by substitution of a silanol H atom by an R\u2019 group (R\u2019 = APTMS). Purple is used for \nthe substituent groups and color code for remaining spheres as in Figure 3.2.2. \n \n\nThe structures of the functionalized materials were obtained by single substitution of protons \n\nin the aromatic rings of the unit cell of PhPMO shown in Figure 3.2.2 by different functional \n\nR groups, e.g. \u2013NH2, \u2013NO2, \u2013NH-i-Pr, \u2013CH2NH2 and \u2013SO3H (c.f. Figure 3.2.3). The \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n96 \n\n \n\nselection of the functional groups considered above was primarily based on their different \n\npolarities and on the presence of amine moieties, which in principle will be beneficial for \n\nimproving the interactions with CO2 without changing significantly those with CH4. The \n\nsubstitution was made at several different positions and the structures of the models obtained \n\nwere fully relaxed. Since the unit cell in Figure 3.2.2 contains three phenyl groups, this \n\nstrategy led to the functionalization of 33% of the aromatic rings, which is similar to the \n\nmaximum functionalization obtained experimentally (see below). The model corresponding \n\nto the functionalization with the APTMS group (R\u2019) was obtained by introduction of this \n\ngroup at the free silanol (substitution of the proton by APTMS) available in the structure of \n\nthe PhPMO model (c.f. Figure 3.2.3). The percentage of APTMS groups grafted to the PMO \n\nwas 50%. \n\nThe models described above were used to study separately the adsorption of CO2 and CH4 \n\nby fully optimizing the atomic positions of the adsorbate/adsorbent complex. The adsorption \n\nenergies were calculated as standard practice by subtracting the energies of the individual \n\nadsorbate and adsorbent fragments from the energy of the complex. Thus, negative values \n\nof the energy correspond to favorable gas/PMO interactions. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Results and discussion \n\nCharacterization of materials. \n\nThe structural integrity of the prepared adsorbents was determined from the combination of \n\nPXRD and N2 sorption isotherms. Figure A2.1 (Appendix A) shows the PXRD diffraction \n\npatterns of PhC12PMO, NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials. The pristine PhC12PMO possesses a two-dimensional \n\nhexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice with a d spacing of 3.59 nm for the strong (100) \n\nreflection at low-angle (Table A2.1, Appendix A). In the case of the aminated samples, slight \n\nchanges are observed in the PXRD (Figure A2.1, Appendix A) corresponding to the loss of \n\ndefinition of the 2D hexagonal arrangement, which is in agreement with the introduction of \n\nthe amine functional groups inside the pores since some loss of regularity in the structure is \n\nexpected during the amination reactions.[51] The lattice parameters of the hexagonal array of \n\nmesopores (calculated from the 2? values of the (100) peaks) obtained for the \n\nNH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO samples are 3.63, \n\n3.34 and 3.50 nm, respectively (Table A2.1, Appendix A). The molecular-scale periodicity \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n97 \n\n \n\nin the PhC12PMO pore walls along the channel direction is observed by the presence of a \n\nmedium-range reflection at d ~ 0.76 nm.[28] The pristine material and all amine \n\nfunctionalized materials present these peaks at the same d spacing. Thus, the preparation of \n\ndifferent amine functionalized phenylene PMOs is made with the preservation of both meso- \n\nand molecular-order. \n\nThe presence of different amine functional groups inside the pore was confirmed by N2 \n\nadsorption\u2013desorption experiments, with isotherms depicted in Figure A2.2 (Appendix A). \n\nThe parent PhC12PMO exhibits a type IV isotherm[52], typically detected for conventional \n\nmesoporous materials such as MCM-41[53], indicating narrow distribution of mesopores of \n\nuniform size. The introduction of the amine functional groups (NH2 group in the aromatic \n\nmoieties or/and APTMS covalently bonded to the free silanols) into the mesochannels is \n\nsupported by the reduction of the BET surface area and pore volume (Table A2.1 and Figure \n\nA2.2, Appendix A). The PhC12PMO, NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials present BET surface areas of 1004, 924, 634 and \n\n305 m\u00b2?g-1, respectively (Table A2.1, Appendix A). The reduction in surface area and pore \n\nvolume is much more pronounced for the APTMS-containing materials, due to the bulky \n\nnature of this group, which protrudes within the pore space. A comparison of the pore size \n\ndistribution (PSD) curves of pristine PMO and amine functionalized PhC12PMO materials \n\nis presented in Figure A2.3 (Appendix A) and in Table A2.1, and reveals a maximum shifting \n\nfrom 2.54 to 2.23 nm, respectively. \n\nSolid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of PhC12PMO,  \n\nNH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@C12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials are displayed \n\nin Figures 3.2.4 and A2.4 (Appendix A), respectively. 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra support \n\nthe different amine functionalizations of PhC12PMO materials. The parent PMO \n\n(Figure 3.2.4a) shows a characteristic resonance at 133 ppm that corresponds to the C of the \n\nphenylene bridge as reported in the literature.[28]  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.4. 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of a) PhC12PMO, b) NH2PhC12PMO,  \n\nc) APTMS@PhC12PMO and d) APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO. The asterisks correspond to the spinning \nside bands. The number symbol denotes traces of surfactant. \n \n\nOn the other hand, the spectra for the NH2PhC12PMO material presents resonances at ca. \n\n121, 133 and 151 ppm assigned to the distinct sp2 carbons associated to the amine \n\nfunctionalized phenylene group. These results are in agreement with previous reports for \n\nNH2PhC12PMO.[27] As expected, the spectrum for APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO also displays \n\nthe three characteristic peaks corresponding to aminated phenyl groups, while that of \n\nAPTMS@PhC12PMO displays the single resonance at 133 ppm. The grafting of the APTMS \n\nto the free silanols in both PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO is verified by \n\n29Si NMR measurements (Figure A2.4, Appendix A). The three resonances appearing at ca. \n\n10, 22 and 43 ppm in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra correspond to the carbons of the propyl \n\nchain of the APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials \n\n (Figure 3.2.4c-d). Figure 3.2.4d shows a tiny peak at around 164 ppm that is assigned to \n\namines binding CO2 from the atmosphere. \n\nThe 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure A2.4, Appendix A) of the pristine \n\nPhC12PMO display resonances at ca. -82, -71 and -61 ppm assigned to T3, T2 and T1  \n\n(Tm = SiR(OSi)m(OH)3-m) organosiliceous species, respectively.

The grafting of the APTMS to the T1 and T2 silanols of \n\nboth PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO leads to the reduction in intensity of the resonances \n\ncorresponding to these species (see Figure A2.4 and Table A2.2, Appendix A) with respect \n\nto T3 environments. In addition, a new resonance appears at ca. -58 ppm, labeled as T2\u2019 in \n\nthis work (Figure A2.4, Appendix A), corresponding to the silanol species of the APTMS \n\nsilicon atom. It is worth mentioning that the difference between T2 and T2\u2019 species is due, \n\nrespectively, to the presence of an aromatic and an alkylamine carbon residue bonded to the \n\nSi center. \n\nThe functionalization of the PhC12PMO material was also followed by FTIR (Figure A2.5, \n\nAppendix A). The presence of aromatic primary amines in the NH2PhC12PMO is confirmed \n\nby the C\u2013N stretching band at 1265 cm-1 and the in plane N\u2013H bending vibration close to \n\n1620 cm-1. This latter band overlaps with the band of H\u2013O\u2013H bending vibrations and the  \n\nN\u2013H stretching modes appearing at 3400 and 3352 cm-1. The amino group of the APTMS in \n\nAPTMS@PhC12PMO and in APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials presents N\u2013H stretching \n\nmodes appearing at 3356 cm-1and at 3354 and 3402 cm-1, respectively. The aromatic C\u2013H \n\nstretching bands appear in the parent PMO at 3065 cm-1, while in the NH2PhC12PMO they \n\nappear at 3066 cm-1 and in the APTMS grafted amine functionalized and non-functionalized \n\nPhC12PMOs they appear at 3064 cm-1. The APTMS@PhC12PMO and the \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials present the C\u2013H stretching vibrations for saturated \n\naliphatic species at 2862 and 2928 cm-1 and at 2867 and 2939 cm-1, respectively. \n\nThe introduction of the amino group in the phenylene moieties of PhC12PMOs and the \n\ngrafting of APTMS to the free silanols of PhC12PMO lead to a reduction of thermal stability \n\nfrom 600 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C and to 300 \u00b0C, respectively, as observed by TGA \n\n(Figure A2.6, Appendix A). The PhC12PMO material presenting both types of amines  \n\n(NH2 and APTMS) is thermally stable only up to 250 \u00b0C. \n\nTable A2.3 (Appendix A) presents the density of amino groups in the PhC12PMO materials \n\ndetermined by EA. The NH2PhC12PMO has a nitrogen percentage of 2.58% that corresponds \n\nto amine density of 1.85 mmol?g-1. The grafting of APTMS into the PhC12PMO leads to a \n\ndensity of amino groups of 1.39 mmol?g-1. The APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO has a total amine \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n100 \n\n \n\ndensity of 2.60 mmol?g-1, which results from the sum of the aromatic amine density of  \n\n1.85 mmol?g-1 and of the APTMS amine density of 0.75 mmol?g-1. \n\n \nExperimental pure-component adsorption isotherms. \n\nPure-component adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 at 25 \u00b0C are shown in Figure 3.2.5. \n\nThe Henry\u2019s constant (KH) was determined for each pure gas adsorbed in each material using \n\nthe Virial model in order to evaluate the interaction of the chemical surface of our materials \n\nwith pure CO2 and pure CH4 at low coverage. The fitting parameters for the Virial model are \n\nprovided in Table 3.2.1. \n\nThe adsorption isotherms in Figure 3.2.5 suggest that the introduction of the amines into the \n\nPhC12PMO material leads to an increase in the amount of adsorbed CO2 and in the Henry\u2019s \n\nconstants, increasing in the order PhC12PMO &lt;NH2PhC12PMO &lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO \n\n&lt;APTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the non-functionalized material presents less affinity for CO2 \n\nthan the aminated samples. In the case of methane adsorption, the PhC12PMO material has \n\nthe highest adsorption affinity, manifested in the highest Henry\u2019s constant (Table 3.2.1), \n\nalthough the differences observed for the different materials suggest that in all cases the \n\nadsorption is significantly lower than that observed for CO2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.5.

This is a consequence of the \n\nintroduction of amino groups covalently bonded to the phenylene bridges of the PhC12PMO \n\nmaterial, corresponding to a nitrogen content of 2.58% (Table A2.3, Appendix A). This is \n\nbetter noticed when the adsorption isotherms are normalized by the BET surface area (Figure \n\n3.2.5b). Therefore, the introduction of an aromatic amine into the PMO channels reveals that \n\nthe chemical functionalization of the PMO material is more important for CO2 capture than \n\nthe amplitude of textural properties such as the surface area and pore diameter. This is a \n\nconsequence of the energetically more important interactions between the CO2 molecules \n\nand the amino groups than with other sites available in the parent PhC12PMO material. \n\nTable 3.2.1 demonstrates that the NH2PhC12PMO material has slightly lower affinity for \n\nCH4 than PhC12PMO, suggesting that the introduction of the amine moiety at the aromatic \n\nrings weakens the interaction of PMO with CH4. This tiny reduction in the CH4 adsorption \n\nis also in accordance with the decrease in the BET surface area and pore volume. Still, the \n\nadsorption of CH4 is small in both cases. The grafting of the APTMS onto the silanols of the \n\npristine PhC12PMO to obtain the APTMS@PhC12PMO material is accompanied by a very \n\npronounced decrease of its surface area and pore volume. \n\n \nTable 3.2.1.

Interestingly, the former \n\ndisplays higher adsorption capacity and Henry\u2019s constant for CO2 than the latter material, \n\nthus revealing that the type of amine has a stronger influence on the sorption capacity for \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n102 \n\n \n\nCO2 than the amount of nitrogen introduced in the PMO channels, suggesting that alkyl \n\namines interact more favorably with CO2 than the aromatic amines, because the former \n\namines present higher basicity than the latter.[54] \n\nThe APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material shows lower adsorption capacity for CO2  \n\n(c.f. Figure 3.2.5a) than APTMS@PhC12PMO, but when the adsorption isotherm is \n\nexpressed taking into account the BET surface area (Figure 3.2.5b) a substantial increase in \n\nthe adsorption of CO2 can be perceived. This is likely to be due to the larger degree of \n\namination resulting from the simultaneous presence of aromatic and alkyl amines in the same \n\nPMO material, despite the concomitant lower BET surface area (305 m2?g-1) and pore size \n\n(2.23 nm) when compared with the other materials described above, c.f. Table A2.1 \n\n(Appendix A). Note that this material only presents 0.75 mmol\u00b7g-1 of APTMS amine density, \n\nmuch lower than in APTMS@PhC12PMO (1.39 mmol\u00b7g-1), and this type of amine interacts \n\nmore strongly with the CO2 molecule than the aromatic amine. \n\nThe Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST)[55] was applied to the analysis of the adsorption \n\ndata by fitting the Virial equation to the pure-component isotherms and calculating the \n\nselectivity of the separation and the equilibrium phase diagrams using a method proposed \n\nby Myers[41] with the implementation described in detail in previous works.[14,15] As can be \n\nseen in Figure 3.2.6, the differences in the predicted selectivities exhibited by the different \n\nmaterials for the CO2/CH4 separation can be quite large. In fact, the materials with APTMS \n\ngroups grafted to the silanols of the PMO present much higher selectivity values than \n\nPhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO. These two latter materials present similar selectivity, but it \n\ncan be noticed that there are a slight increase in the selectivity at low pressures for \n\nNH2PhC12PMO (3.6 at 100 kPa) when compared with PhC12PMO (3.2 at 100 kPa). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n103 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2.6. Average selectivity for the CO2/CH4 separation on the different materials at 25 \u00b0C.  \n? labels correspond to PhC12PMO, \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 labels correspond to NH2PhC12PMO, ? labels correspond to \nAPTMS@PhC12PMO, and ? labels correspond to APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO. \n \n\nThis indicates that the aromatic amine is not bringing the desired effect in the selectivity \n\nover the entire range of pressures (Table 3.2.1). Variation of selectivity with pressure is also \n\nseen in the case of the APTMS materials. At low pressures, APTMS@PhC12PMO presents \n\nhigher selectivity than APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO but this ordering is reversed at higher \n\npressures. This is most probably related with the kind of amines and their amount present on \n\nthe materials. The APTMS@PhC12PMO material presents only alkyl amines that seem to \n\ninteract more strongly with CO2 than aromatic amines. Alkyl amines are also available in \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material but their amount, determined by EA, is one half of the \n\namount of aminopropyl groups presented in APTMS@PhC12PMO (Table A2.3,  \n\nAppendix A). Thus, at low pressure, APTMS@PhC12PMO shows better selectivity than  \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO because of the more important role of the type of amine than of \n\nits quantity. Still, the nitrogen content in the latter PMO is larger than that in the former  \n\n(2.60 versus 1.39 mmol?g-1). The interaction of CO2 with the aromatic amines is less \n\nfavorable than with the alkylamines of grafted APTMS moieties but is more stable than any \n\nother site available in these PMOs. Hence, at high pressure, the larger amount of amines in \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhC12PMO dictates a better selectivity for CO2. These effects are even clearer \n\nin the ratio of the values of the Henry constants determined for CO2 and CH4 adsorption on \n\neach of the materials studied experimentally in this work (Table 3.2.1), which can be also \n\nused as an estimate of the ability of the materials for separating these gases.

Thus, the adsorbed phase is much richer in carbon dioxide than in methane for both \n\nmaterials with an adsorption of almost pure carbon dioxide (about 0.94 \u2013 0.98 molar \n\ncomposition at 500 kPa and 25 \u00b0C) at 0.5 composition in the gas phase. Complete phase \n\ndiagrams were also obtained (Figure A2.7, Appendix A), which confirm a similar \n\nperformance of these two materials. \n\nImportant for establishing the adequacy of these materials for typical adsorptive applications \n\nis the understanding of any structural changes upon degasification.

Upon grafting \n\nwith APTMS (APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO), four peaks were observed at ca. -262, -295,  \n\n-320, and -348 ppm (Figure 3.2.8b). The latter two resonances are assigned to the aromatic \n\namine and to the propylamine groups, respectively. The remaining resonances at ca. -262 \n\nand -295 ppm are assigned to species containing a carbonyl group resulting from the \n\nchemisorption of the CO2 molecules. The presence of such species is also evident in the \n\n 13C CP-MAS NMR showing resonances at ca. 178 and 164 ppm (Figure A2.8, Appendix \n\nA), confirming the observations in the 15N CP-MAS spectra, i.e., a minor quantity of CO2 \n\nremains bonded to the amines after activation at 100 \u00b0C. The 13C resonance appearing at  \n\n164 ppm has been assigned to carbamate species by solid-state NMR and FTIR,[56] and is \n\nassociated to the presence of the peak at -265 ppm in the 15N CP-MAS NMR. The peak at \n\n178 ppm appears only when CO2 is adsorbed into the APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material, \n\nwhich coincides with the presence of a distinct resonance at -262 ppm in the 15N CP-MAS \n\nNMR for this same material. Thus, it is assumed that this resonance, in a chemical shift \n\nregion typical of carbonyl groups, is due to a chemisorbed CO2 species involving the \n\nsimultaneous participation of the aromatic and aliphatic amines. The nature of such species \n\ncannot be unambiguously assigned from the data in the present study as this would require \n\nfurther experiments under well controlled conditions (pressure, temperature, moisture \n\nlevels). The spectrum of APTMS@PhC12PMO after material activation shows the presence \n\nof two peaks at ca. -293 and -352 ppm (Figure 3.2.8c). The latter peak is assigned to APTMS \n\nattached to the surface of the material, while the former peak corresponds to carbamate \n\nspecies as observed for analogous materials also functionalized with the aminopropyl \n\ngroup.[56] The persistence of CO2 species after the degassing procedure above-mentioned is \n\nnot surprising. Indeed, it was previously shown that higher temperature was needed (about \n\n150 \u00b0C) to completely remove the CO2 from amine functionalized materials, and at 100 \u00b0C \n\nonly about 91% of bonded CO2 could be removed.[56] \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n106 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2.8. 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra of the reactivated materials: a) NH2PhC12PMO;  \nb) APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO; and c) APTMS@PhC12PMO after a first cycle of CO2 adsorption. \n \n\nAll prepared materials were also tested for adsorption of pure CH4 and CO2, but measured \n\nin a pressure range between 0 and 200 kPa at 35 \u00b0C. Figure A2.9 and Table A2.4 (Appendix \n\nA) show the results obtained for the most promising material, APTMS@PhC12PMO. As \n\nexpected, APTMS@PhC12PMO adsorbs more CO2 amount at 25 \u00b0C than at 35 \u00b0C, given that \n\nadsorption is an exothermic process. The CH4 pure adsorption capacities and the related \n\nHenry\u2019s constant are similar for both temperatures (25 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C), but this is most likely \n\nbecause of the low adsorbed amounts of this gas together with the relatively small \n\ntemperature difference between isotherms (10 \u00b0C), which makes it difficult observe the \n\neffect of temperature. \n\n \n\nComputer simulations of all prepared functionalized PMO materials. \n\nComputational tools were used to understand the interaction between CO2 and CH4 \n\nmolecules and the different functionalities in the prepared PMOs.

Several \n\ndifferent starting configurations of the APTMS moiety were considered because of the high \n\nnumber of degrees of freedom of this group. The two most favorable positions for each \n\nAPTMS functionalized PhPMO are presented in Figure 3.2.10. The adsorption energies for \n\nthe CO2 and CH4 molecules interacting with each of the PMO models described above are \n\nreported in Table 3.2.2, and views of the most favorable locations are given in Figure 3.2.11.  \n\nThe PBE-D2 energies for CO2 adsorption vary between -19.8 kJ\u00b7mol-1 in the case of the \n\nparent PhPMO and -29.0 kJ\u00b7mol-1 for the APTMS@PhPMO material, while for CH4 the \n\nadsorption energies are in the interval between -9.5 and -13.7 kJ\u00b7mol-1 for \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhPMO and APTMS@PhPMO, respectively. Thus, the adsorption energies \n\nof CO2 with the different materials are much higher than the adsorption energies obtained \n\nfor CH4 and, despite the limitations associated to the structural models used and the \n\nnon-consideration of kinetic data, the calculated results are in line with the strength of the \n\nHenry\u2019s constants calculated from experimental adsorption isotherms (Table 3.2.1). \n\nIn particular, the adsorption energies for CO2 increase in the order PhPMO &lt;NH2PhPMO &lt;\n\nAPTMS@NH2PhPMO &lt;APTMS@PhPMO, which is the same order obtained for the \n\nHenry\u2019s constants for the CO2 gas.

In the case of NH2PhPMO, the CO2 \n\ninteraction occurs with both the silanol and amino groups at nearest-neighbor distances of \n\n2.45 and 2.60 \u00c5, respectively. For APTMS@PhPMO, CO2 interacts with both the amino \n\ngroup and an acidic hydrogen (H20) of the alkyl chain of the APTMS group at nearest-\n\nneighbor distances of 2.58 and 2.75 \u00c5, respectively. The CO2 in APTMS@NH2PhPMO \n\ninteracts with the silanol group and an acidic hydrogen (H20) of the alkyl chain of the \n\nAPTMS group, at nearest-neighbor distances of 2.45 and 2.62 \u00c5, respectively. A direct \n\nrelationship between geometric parameters and calculated adsorption energies is unclear, \n\nwith the exception that in the case of the parent compound the CO2 molecule is interacting \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n109 \n\n \n\nwith a single site on the PMO wall while in the aminated materials the most favorable \n\ninteractions involve two sites. This is likely to be the main cause for the significantly more \n\nfavorable adsorption energies observed in all the aminated materials with respect to the \n\npristine PhPMO (Table 3.2.2). \n\n \nTable 3.2.2.

The nearest-neighbor distances \n\n(Table A2.5, Appendix A) are 3.07, 2.36, 2.58 and 2.14 \u00c5, respectively. \n\nAs in the case of CO2, a direct relationship between the calculated energies and the selected \n\ngeometrical parameters is not evident. Nevertheless, it arises that the interaction of methane \n\nwith the models having an amino group in the aromatic ring is weaker than those calculated \n\nfor the corresponding materials without such groups (c.f. compare adsorption energies \n\nreported in Table 3.2.2 for PhPMO and APTMS@PhPMO with those for NH2PhPMO and \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhPMO). \n\nFrom the pure CO2 and CH4 experimental adsorption in the prepared PMO, it is possible to \n\nconclude that all these materials adsorb similar amounts of methane, in very small quantities, \n\nwhile the CO2 adsorption is much higher. Therefore, it is more relevant to examine the CO2 \n\nadsorption energies calculated for the prepared materials than the adsorption energies \n\nobtained for CH4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n110 \n\n \n\n-R / R\u2019 \ngroups \n\nClean CO2 CH4 \n\n-H / -H \n\n   \n\n-H / -NH2 \n\n   \n\n-APTMS / \n-H \n\n   \n\n-APTMS / \n-NH2 \n\n   \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.11. Top views of the optimized clean, and CO2 or CH4 covered aminated PhPMO \nmaterials. Color code for adsorbent atoms as in Figure 3.2.9, and light green and light blue are used \nfor atoms in CO2 and CH4 adsorbates, respectively. The numbering is the same as used in Table A2.5 \ncontaining selected geometrical parameters. \n \n\nThe correlation between the adsorption energies obtained for the CO2 molecules and the \n\nHenry\u2019s constants for the CO2 adsorption in each material are in good agreement, showing \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n111 \n\n \n\nthat despite the inherent limitations of the computational model (for example, consideration \n\nof a single lowest energy adsorption site, thus neglecting entropic factors), it can be used to \n\npredict the potential of other functionalized phenylene-PMOs for the adsorption of CO2 or \n\nfor the separation of CO2 from CH4. \n\n \nMolecular simulation of other R functionalized PhPMO materials. \n\nSince the adsorption energies calculated with DFT for CO2 and CH4 in the parent and \n\naminated PhPMOs compared well with the experimentally determined gas adsorption \n\ncapacities of such materials, further DFT calculations were performed to understand how \n\nother functional groups (e.g. \u2013NO2, \u2013NH-i-Pr, \u2013CH2NH2 and \u2013SO3H) interact with CO2 and \n\nCH4, with the purpose of optimizing resources and avoiding the synthesis of ineffective \n\nmaterials. These functional groups were chosen on the basis of their different polarities and \n\nof the ease of preparation of PMO-functionalized materials.[27,28] To enable direct \n\ncomparison with the results presented in the previous section, only one third of the aromatic \n\nphenylene moieties were functionalized with such groups. The two most favorable \n\nconfigurations for each new PMO derived from PhPMO obtained after full optimization are \n\npresented in Figure 3.2.12. The interaction of CO2 and CH4 molecules with the two \n\nconfigurations in Figure 3.2.12 for each RPhPMO was analyzed by DFT. The calculated \n\nadsorption energies are reported in Table 3.2.3 and the final configurations for the two \n\nadsorbates interacting with each material are depicted in Figure 3.2.13. Selected geometrical \n\nparameters are supplied in Table A2.6 (Appendix A). \n\nThe comparison of the energetic data in Tables 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 shows that the introduction \n\nof the nitro group (\u2013NO2) in the phenylene moieties of the PhPMOs increases slightly the \n\ninteraction of both CO2 (-2.1 kJ?mol-1) and CH4 (-0.4 kJ?mol-1). These tiny differences seem \n\nto be associated to the interaction of the carbon atom of CO2 and one of the hydrogen atoms \n\nof CH4 with an oxygen atom of the nitro group (Table A2.6, Appendix A). The DFT results \n\nsuggest that nitrated materials are less promising than the aminated PMOs for this separation. \n\n \nTable 3.2.3.

Side views of the two most favorable configurations for R functionalized PhPMOs. \n \n\nThe introduction of an iso-propylamine group in the phenylene bridge of PhPMO leads to \n\nsignificant increases in the adsorption energies calculated for both CO2 (-7.8 kJ?mol-1) and \n\nCH4 (-4.7 kJ?mol-1) when compared with the parent PhPMO value. However, relative to \n\nNH2PhPMO, the CO2 energy is only slightly increased, while that of methane increases more \n\nsignificantly. These changes are most likely a consequence of improved interactions of CO2 \n\nwith the amine moiety and of methane with the propyl groups. Indeed, some  \n\nauthors,[16,57] reported that propyl amines can improve the interaction with CO2. \n\nNevertheless, based on the DFT adsorption energies calculated in this work, the  \n\ni-PrNHPhPMO material is anticipated to present similar CO2 adsorption capacity but poorer \n\nselectivity for CO2/CH4 separations than those observed for NH2PhPMO. Since an additional \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n113 \n\n \n\nsynthetic step is required to obtain i-PrNHPhPMO, the latter becomes less interesting than \n\nNH2PhPMO for this adsorption application. \n\n \n\n-R \ngroup \n\nClean CO2 CH4 \n\n-NO2 \n\n   \n\n-NH-i-\nPr \n\n   \n\n-\nCH2NH2\n\n   \n\n-SO3H \n\n   \n\n \nFigure 3.2.13. Top views of the most stable configurations for clean and CO2 or CH4 covered \nRPhPMOs optimized at the PBE-D2 level of theory. The numbering is the same as used in Table \nA2.6 containing selected geometrical parameters. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n114 \n\n \n\nThe material with the \u2013CH2NH2 functional group shows the strongest adsorption energy with \n\nthe CO2 molecule of all PhPMOs studied in this work. The adsorption energy is  \n\n-31.1 kJ?mol-1, i.e., an increase of -2.1 kJ\u00b7mol-1 when compared with APTMS@PhPMO, \n\nsuggesting that the former material may show more interesting CO2 adsorption affinity than \n\nthe latter without significantly changing the selectivity of the CO2/CH4 separation. \n\nFinally, the calculated energies for the substitution of a hydrogen atom in the phenylene ring \n\nby a sulfonic acid group (\u2013SO3H) suggest that the resulting material will have adsorption \n\nprofiles for CO2 and CH4 similar to those displayed by NH2PhPMO and  \n\nAPTMS@NH2PhPMO. Interestingly, the CO2 molecule interacts with the hydrogen atom \n\nfrom the -SiOH group but not with that from the \u2013SO3H group. This suggests that the \n\ninteraction with the former is more important and that the quite short distance between the  \n\n\u2013SiOH and the -SO3H groups hinders the formation of simultaneous contacts with these two \n\ngroups. \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Conclusions \n\nPhC12PMOs functionalized with different types of amines were successfully prepared and \n\ncharacterized. The pristine and amine-functionalized PhC12PMO materials exhibit both \n\nmeso- and molecular-scale orders observed by PXRD. These materials were tested for \n\nadsorption of pure CO2 and CH4 at 25 and 35 \u00b0C. All prepared materials presented much \n\nhigher CO2 adsorption than that of CH4. The introduction of amines into the PhC12PMO \n\nmaterial generally gave rise to an increase in the quantity of adsorbed CO2 over the studied \n\npressure range. More importantly, it significantly increased the Henry\u2019s constants of CO2, \n\ngrowing in the order PhC12PMO &lt;NH2PhC12PMO &lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO &lt;\n\nAPTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the APTMS@PhC12PMO material has more affinity for CO2 \n\nthan any other PMO material. Thus, it was observed that the type of amine presents a \n\ndominant effect on the CO2 sorption affinity, more so than the nitrogen content in the PMO \n\nchannels, demonstrating that alkyl amines interact more favorably with CO2 than aromatic \n\namines. Furthermore, the observed reduction in surface area and pore volume upon \n\nfunctionalization is more than compensated by the increased affinity under the conditions \n\nstudied here. After the adsorption study, the chemical integrity of the amine modified PMOs \n\nwas evaluated by 13C CP-MAS and 15N CP-MAS NMR, indicating that PMO materials \n\nrelease the CO2 after activation and can be reused. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n115 \n\n \n\nPeriodic DFT calculations were successfully used for the first time to evaluate the behavior \n\nof different kinds of amine-functionalized PhPMO on the CO2 and CH4 adsorption and \n\ncorrelated with the Henry\u2019s constants. The same trend was found in both DFT calculations \n\nand gas adsorption measurements, showing that this type of theoretical studies can be used \n\nto predict if a chemical modification of the PMO promotes an increase in the selectivity of \n\nCO2 relative to CH4. Furthermore, DFT calculation were also used to studied the preferential \n\nadsorption sites and adsorption energies of CO2 and CH4 molecules on PMOs functionalized \n\nin the phenylene moieties with different groups (\u2013NO2, \u2013NH-i-Pr,\u2013CH2NH2, and \u2013SO3H), in \n\norder to guide the synthesis of new promising materials. It was found that the PhPMO \n\nfunctionalized with CH2NH2 is most likely to enhance CO2 adsorption without changing \n\nsignificantly the adsorption of CH4, and is thus a promising candidate for future experimental \n\nstudies. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n116 \n\n \n\n3.3 Bibliography \n\n1 A.E.

The ALD \n\ndepositions were performed by Ricardo Silva under supervision of Nicola Pinna and  \n\nRui F. Silva. Stephane Pronier collected the TEM images. I have characterized all the \n\nmaterials prior and after the deposition of the aluminium oxide. Using a volumetric \n\napparatus, I also carried out at the University of Lisbon the CO2 and CH4 pure adsorption \n\nexperiments under the guidance of Mois\u00e9s L. Pinto and Jo\u00e3o Pires. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n123 \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Motivation \n\nAs it was seen in Chapter 3, PMOs with phenylene-bridge (PhC18PMO) can be easily \n\nmodified[1\u20133] to turn its surface prompt to adsorb selectively CO2. To date, enhancement of \n\nthe selectivity of porous materials towards CO2 has mainly been attempted by organic \n\nmodifications.[4\u201311] Zeolites and MOFs with aluminium (Al) open centres incorporated into \n\ntheir matrix structure have been shown to improve the adsorption of CO2.[12\u201318] Herein, it is \n\ndescribed for the first time the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to modify the \n\nPhC18PMO surface with Al2O3 in order to design a novel CO2 adsorbent. ALD comprises a \n\nsequence of self-limiting chemical reactions between gas-phase precursor molecules and the \n\nsolid surface. The self-limiting nature of ALD gives rise to a conformal growth and an \n\nadditional control over the total stack thickness. The film thickness in a planar substrate can \n\nbe determined precisely by the number of coating cycles.[19] In this work, by varying the \n\nnumber of ALD deposition cycles, the quantity of aluminium oxide deposited as well as the \n\ntype of aluminium species on the PhC18PMO were studied. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Experimental details \n\nPMO synthesis \n\nThe mesoporous phenylene bridged PMO was synthesized according to the literature \n\nprocedures with slight modifications.[20\u201322] The synthesis of PhC18PMO started with the \n\nhydrolysis and condensation of home-made 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB, c.f.  \n\nSub-chapter 2.1, 4.78 g) precursor[23] in the presence of octadecyltrimethylammonium \n\nbromide surfactant template (C18-TMA, 4.8 g) in 124 mL of distilled water with 8 mL of  \n\n6 M NaOH solution. This solution was kept for 20 minutes in an ultrasonic vessel and stirred \n\nfor 24 hours at room temperature. After 24 hours of ageing, the solution was transferred to \n\nTeflon-lined stain-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal treatment \n\nbegins with a pre-heating of the autoclave in an oven at 200 \u00b0C during 40 minutes, and then \n\nit was transferred to another oven at 100 \u00b0C. After 24 hours, the solid was filter and washed. \n\nThe template was extracted by an ethanol/HCl solution to obtain a free-pore PhC18PMO. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n124 \n\n \n\nAl2O3-PMO preparation \n\nALD was performed with a cross flow home-made reactor working in continuous mode, \n\nusing water and trimethylaluminium (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) as precursors. The precursors \n\nwere alternately introduced through ALD pneumatic valves from their reservoirs, which \n\nwere kept at room temperature. Alumina (Al2O3) was deposited onto the PhC18PMO at \n\n200 \u00b0C, under 100 sccm of N2 flow, using reactant pulse times of 0.05 s and 0.10 s for water \n\nand trimethylaluminium, respectively, and 30 s between pulse times. The typical operating \n\npressures varied from 1.6 to 2.0 Pa during the precursor pulses. The quantity of Al2O3 \n\ndeposited by ALD onto the PhC18PMO was determined by direct measurements performed \n\nbefore and after the ALD coating using an analytical balance with a precision of 0.1 mg. The \n\nresultant composite materials are denoted from now on as Al-PhC18PMO#x, where x \n\ncorresponds to the number of deposition cycles. \n\nAn additional sample, PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a was prepared by physical mixture of PhC18PMO \n\nand amorphous Al2O3. The amorphous alumina was synthetized according to the literature[24] \n\nwith some experimental modifications. The aluminium isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3, Aldrich,  \n\n1 g) was solubilized in ethanol (EtOH, PA, Carlo Erba, 9.75 mL). Then, 0.46 g of nitric acid \n\n(HNO3, 65 %, Panreac) was added to the solution, and the solution was vigorous stirred \n\novernight at room temperature (RT). Then, the solution was transferred to an oven for 2 days \n\nat 60 \u00b0C to induce the controlled evaporation of the solvent and to obtain the dry material. \n\nThe obtained material was calcined at 400 \u00b0C during 4 h with a heating ramp of 5 \u00b0C?min-1. \n\n \nMaterials characterization \n\nThe physical, textural and chemical properties of the pristine PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO \n\ncomposites were evaluated by SEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), \n\nPXRD, N2 sorption isotherms, TEM, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR, 13C CP-MAS \n\nand 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopies. The thermal stability of materials was evaluated by \n\nTGA. Description of the experimental conditions is presented at Chapter 2 and some of the \n\ncharacterization data is presented in Appendix B. \n\n \nHigh pressure adsorption of CO2 and CH4 \n\nAdsorption experiments of CO2 and CH4 on selected samples were conducted up to 1000 \n\nkPa at 25 \u00b0C, using the volumetric method using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6. \n\nThe non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third virial \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n125 \n\n \n\ncoefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the absolute \n\nadsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the density \n\nof the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using a \n\nmethod proposed by Myers[25] and the implementation is described in detail in previous \n\nworks[26]. \n\n \n\n4.1.3 Results and discussion \n\nThe influence of ALD deposition cycles on the morphological changes of PhC18PMO was \n\ninvestigated with a particular focus on the decrease of the surface area and pore volume. A \n\nseries of Al2O3 depositions onto the PhC18PMO were performed using different number of \n\ncycles (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cycles). Weight gain measurements were performed on 25 mg \n\nPhC18PMO samples after the ALD coating to establish a relation with the number of cycles \n\nand the quantity of Al2O3 (here denoted as Al) deposited as shown in Table 4.1.1. This Table \n\nshows that the weight gain increases with the number of coating cycles. \n\n \nTable 4.1.1. Weight gain measurements between 0 and 100 Al2O3 ALD cycles and Si/Al ratios \ndetermined by EDS. \n\nSample \nWeight \n\n(mg) \n???? weight \n\n(mg) \n[Si/Al]EDS \n\nPhC18PMO 25.0 - 0 \nAl-PhC18PMO#2 n.m.a n.m.a n.m.a \nAl-PhC18PMO#10 28.7 + 3.7 10.47 \nAl-PhC18PMO#20 31.8 + 6.8 2.54 \nAl-PhC18PMO#50 32.6 + 7.6 1.87 \nAl-PhC18PMO#100 35.3 + 10.3 0.94 \n\nanot measured. \n\n \nThe Si/Al ratios determined by EDS (Table 4.1.1) reveal that the Al contents in the \n\nPhC18PMO increase with the number of applied ALD cycles. The difference between these \n\nvalues proves that the ALD precursors modified the pristine PhC18PMO material. It is \n\ninteresting to note that Si/Al ratio does not decrease linearly with the weight gain. \n\nThe top surface morphology of the PhC18PMO coated with Al2O3 after 50 ALD cycles, i.e., \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 sample, was analysed from SEM and STEM bright field images  \n\n(Figure 4.1.1a and b) and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, which show the \n\nhomogeneous distribution at \u00b5m-scale of both aluminium and silicon on the composite \n\n(Figure 4.1.1c and d). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n126 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1.1. a) SEM and b) STEM bright field micrograph images of Al-PhC18PMO#50. The \nelemental map reveals the homogeneous distribution of aluminium (c) and of silicon (d). \n \n\nPXRD patterns of PhC18PMO, Al-PhC18PMO#2, Al-PhC18PMO#10, Al-PhC18PMO#20,  \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100, c.f. Figure 4.1.2, show the two-dimensional \n\nhexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice for all materials due to the presence of the first strong \n\nlow-angle (100) reflection with d100 = 4.82 nm and the two much less intense (110) and (200) \n\npeaks. It is possible to observe in Figure 4.1.2 the decrease of intensity of the peaks with the \n\nincrease of the number of Al2O3 deposition cycles. In addition, Figure 4.1.2 and numerical \n\nvalues in Table 4.1.2 display a slight shift to higher angles in the d100 diffraction peak as the \n\nnumber of deposition cycles increase. The peak at d = 0.762 nm corresponds to the \n\nmolecular-scale crystal-like structure. The reduction in the intensity of this peak is also \n\nobserved upon modification by Al2O3. A slight shift to higher angles is again observed. \n\nPeaks associated to both meso- and molecular- scale periodicities are preserved after \n\nmodification suggesting that the PhC18PMO structure is not affected by the ALD conditions. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n127 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.2. X-ray diffraction patterns of PhC18PMO, Al-PhC18PMO#2, Al-PhC18PMO#10,  \nAl-PhC18PMO#20, Al-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100. \n \n\nFor CO2 adsorption application, it is of crucial importance that the pores are still accessible \n\nafter ALD modification. The low temperature (-196 \u00b0C) nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption \n\nisotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) curves (Table 4.1.2 and Figure B1.2, Appendix \n\nB) confirm the type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) for PhC18PMO and ALD modified \n\nPhC18PMO with narrow distribution of pore sizes, typically observed for conventional \n\nmesoporous materials such as MCM-41, with a hexagonal structure. After 100 cycles of \n\nAl2O3 deposition, a significant decrease in the N2 adsorbed amounts is observed. This may \n\nindicate that some of the pores are clogged. \n\n \nTable 4.1.2.

This effect was most pronounced for the sample Al-PhC18PMO#100. \n\nThe TEM cross-section image and corresponding EDS analyses of the pristine PhC18PMO \n\nand the composites Al-PhC18PMO#2, Al-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100 are shown \n\nin Figures 4.1.3 and B1.3. The collected images show the hexagonal arrangement of the \n\npores for all materials suggesting that the Al modification using ALD technology is not \n\ncontributing to disrupt of the pore structure of the parent PhC18PMO (c.f. Figure 4.1.3), \n\nwhich is in agreement with the PXRD diffractograms (c.f. Figure 4.1.2). Additionally, it is \n\nalso possible to observe the mass contrast in the images of the Al-PhC18PMO composites. \n\nThe darker zones correspond to the Al content inserted into the pores or present at the surface \n\nof the materials, Figures 4.1.3 (Al-PhC18PMO#100) and B1.3 (Appendix B). TEM EDS \n\nanalyses seem to indicate a low degree of aluminium impregnation inside the pores of the \n\nPhC18PMO. The aluminium oxide is mostly deposited at the external surface of the particle \n\nfor all composite materials, Figure B1.3 (Appendix B). This behaviour is more evident for \n\nthe composite materials obtained with larger number of deposition cycles, e.g.  \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100. The insets illustrate the FFT of hexagonal \n\narrangement of the pores of the composites. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.1.3.

The spectra (Figure B1.4a) obtained with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\n(FTIR) show that the PhC18PMO parent material displays adsorption bands assignable to the \n\nphenylene ring vibrations (1300\u20132000 cm-1) and strong adsorption bands (900-650 cm-1),  \n\nC\u2013H species (2980-3060 cm-1, Figure B1.4b), and stretching modes of silanol (3632 cm-1,  \n\nFigure B1.4b). The increase of the amount of Al2O3 deposited in the pristine PhC18PMO is \n\nobserved in the FTIR spectra by the reduction of the intensity of the bands between 350 and \n\n1200 cm-1. The 29Si and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.5 and \n\nFigure B1.6) were also collected for comparison with the already described pristine PMO.[20] \n29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum of Al-PhC18PMO#50 exhibits the typical peaks at ca. -81, -72 \n\nand -61 ppm attributed to T3, T2 and T1 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m] organosiliceous species, \n\nrespectively, without any alteration comparing with the parent material.[2,20] The material \n\nobtained from deposition of Al2O3 by ALD at 200 \u00b0C does not present resonances in the \n\nregion of the Qn species [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] proving that the C-Si bonds are intact.  \n\nTable B1.1 shows the percentages of Tm species in PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO#50. These \n\npercentages are calculated from the deconvolution of the 29Si MAS NMR spectra, using the \n\ncommon assumption of Gaussian distributions of isotropic chemical shifts for each type of  \n\nTm species. Usually, the overlapping of Tm resonances is noticed, leading to small variations \n\nbetween best-fit intensity parameters and, consequently, to uncertainties associated with the \n\nrelative populations of the Tm sites. The degree of condensation is 59% for the PhC18PMO \n\nand 64% for the Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite. The increase of approximately 5% in the T3 \n\nsilicon species and the reduction of T2 site in the Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite are probably \n\ndue to some condensation of alumina to the free hydroxyl group of the T2 silicon \n\nenvironment of the PhC18PMO. Furthermore, 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum supports the \n\npreservation of the material chemistry displaying only one peak at ca. 133 ppm that is \n\nassigned to the carbons of the phenylene bridge. 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 4.1.4) \n\nshows the presence of three peaks at 5, 38 and 62 ppm assigned to the AlVI octahedral, AlV \n\nbipyramidal and AlIV tetrahedral coordinated aluminium, respectively. Note that the Al2O3 \n\ndeposited by ALD is amorphous. However, the tetrahedral and the bipyramidal Al-sites can \n\npromote acidity in the material. This property can allow the use of Al-PhC18PMO composites \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n131 \n\n \n\nin CO2/CH4 separation once promotes the interaction between composite and the CO2 \n\nquadrupole and consequently improves the selectivity. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.4. 27Al MAS NMR spectra of Al-PhC18PMO#2 (green line) and Al-PhC18PMO#50 \n(orange line). \n \n\nFigure 4.1.4 also shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of the Al-PhC18PMO#2 composite. \n\nThis material presents two main distinct peaks, which are assigned to the AlVI octahedral \n\nand AlIV tetrahedral coordinated aluminium species. A third peak attributed to \n\npentacoordinated aluminium species (AlV) grows in importance with the increase of the \n\nnumber of cycles, which is a sign of the formation of defects. \n\nThe TGA curve of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.7) exhibits a first weight loss below  \n\n100 \u00b0C due to desorption of physisorbed water. It is possible to observe a 3 % weight loss \n\nfrom 100 to 250 \u00b0C due to the presence of a small quantity of non-extracted template. At 400 \n\nand 630 \u00b0C, it is possible to observe two weight losses of 23 % due to the decomposition and \n\nrelease of the organic moieties from the bridges of the PhC18PMO material. Note that the \n\npristine PhC18PMO material presents a thermal stability up to 550 \u00b0C and above that \n\ntemperature only one weight loss is observed.[2,20] Thus, the introduction of the Al content \n\ndecreases the thermal stability of the material. This means that the degradation of the organic \n\ncontent is aided by the deposited Al2O3 in two steps due to the presence of different types of \n\nAl coordination. The first step of degradation of the phenylene bridges occurs probably due \n\nto the contact of infiltrated pentacoordinated alumina (AlV) with the organic moieties of the \n\nPhC18PMO. The other weight loss at 630 \u00b0C corresponds to the degradation and release of \n\nthe remaining phenylene moieties. These organic moieties probably are in contact with the \n\n-150-5050150\n\n? (ppm)\n\n6\n2\n\n3\n8\n\n5\n\nAlIV\n\nAlV\n\nAlVI\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n132 \n\n \n\noctahedral alumina (AlVI). Note that this temperature of degradation is superior to the \n\ntemperature needed to promote the degradation of phenylene bridges of the pristine \n\nPhC18PMO (550 \u00b0C). This picture is supported by the larger stability of the AlVI species \n\nwhich presumably protect the organic bridges in their vicinity with a concomitant increase \n\nin their thermal stability. \n\nHigh pressure adsorption of methane and carbon dioxide was performed on samples  \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50, Al-PhC18PMO#2 and parent PhC18PMO. These PMOs modified with \n\nALD were chosen because they presented different properties as above discussed, but they \n\nstill maintained a significant surface area and pore volume (Table 4.1.2). The adsorbed \n\namounts on the samples modified with ALD (Al-PhC18PMO#50, Al-PhC18PMO#2) \n\ndecreased for both carbon dioxide and methane (Figure 4.1.5). It can be noted that the \n\ndecreasing is more pronounced on the sample treated with more ALD cycles  \n\n (Al-PhC18PMO#50). This is expected taking into account the significant decrease in pore \n\nvolume comparing with that determined for the parent PhC18PMO (about 60 %, Table 4.1.2). \n\nHowever, the decrease in the adsorbed amounts is different for carbon dioxide and methane. \n\nComparing the isotherms for PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO#50, it becomes clear that the \n\ndecrease is less pronounced with carbon dioxide, probably because of the specific interaction \n\nof this molecule with the surface of the materials. In fact, the isotherm data was fitted with \n\na virial equation (lines in Figure 4.1.5; parameters in Table 4.1.3) and observed that the \n\nHenry constant (KH), which is sensitive to the interaction of the molecules with the surface \n\nof the materials, increases with the number of ALD cycles for the carbon dioxide case and \n\nconversely decreases for the methane case. This indicates that the surface of the PhC18PMO \n\nis increasing the affinity for carbon dioxide with the number of ALD cycles, while the \n\ncontrary is observed for methane. Another way to ascertain this increase is to represent the \n\nadsorbed amounts per surface area of the materials (SBET) instead of mass, in order to take \n\ninto account the decrease of the surface observed due to ALD treatment and to normalize the \n\nresults by surface affinity. These results (Figure B1.8) clearly show a significant increase of \n\nabout two times from PhC18PMO to Al-PhC18PMO#50 in the adsorbed amount of carbon \n\ndioxide per surface area when more Al2O3 is introduced in the pores of PhC18PMO. This \n\nchange has a dramatic impact on the separation properties of the materials as it will be \n\ndiscussed below. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n133 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.5.

This is most probably related with the aluminium pentacoordinated \n\nspecies (AlV) that are present in large amount in the Al-PhC18PMO#50 and almost absent in  \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#2. This type of aluminium oxide species is very acidic[29,30] and can interact \n\nstrongly with the carbon dioxide quadrupolar moment (3.3\u00d710-16 cm2).[31] It is worth \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nn\n a\n\nd\ns\n\n(m\nm\n\no\nl\u00b7\n\ng\n-1\n\n)\n\np (kPa)\n\nPMO\nAl-PMO#2\nAl-PMO#50\n\nCO2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nn\n a\n\nd\ns\n\n(m\nm\n\no\nl\u00b7\n\ng\n-1\n\n)\n\np (kPa)\n\nPMO\n\nAl-PMO#2\n\nAl-PMO#50\n\nCH4PhC18PMO\nAl-PhC18PMO#2\nAl-PhC18PMO#50\n\nPhC18PMO\nAl-PhC18PMO#2\nAl-PhC18PMO#50\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n134 \n\n \n\nmentioning that the selectivity values found for the CO2/CH4 separation on  \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 sample are similar to those found on some pillared clays with aluminium \n\noxide pillars.[26,28] \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.6.

Complete phase diagrams can also be obtained (Figure B1.9), which confirm the \n\nbest performance of the Al-PhC18PMO#50 sample. Thus, the small decrease in adsorption \n\ncapacity due to the ALD treatment is largely compensated by the increase in the selectivity. \n\nThe application of adsorbent materials on the separation of gases is only industrially viable \n\nif the material can be easily regenerated with minimum loss of capacity after each \n\nregeneration cycle. Here, it was tested the regeneration possibility on the Al-PhC18PMO#2 \n\nand Al-PhC18PMO#50 composites using just vacuum during a half hour at ambient \n\ntemperature. This corresponds to what happens industrially during the regeneration step of \n\na vacuum swing adsorption process (VSA).[32] From the presented results (Figure 4.1.8), \n\nonly a slight decrease in the high pressure region can be noted in both composites, although \n\nmore significant in Al-PhC18PMO#50. This is a first good indication that these materials can \n\nbe easily regenerated and that they are stable to be used under cyclic separation processes. \n\nAdditional confirmation using a higher number of cycles would be needed to confirm the \n\nstability required for application in industry. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1.8.

For a \n\nmore realistic comparison, the amorphous alumina used presents a similar chemical \n\ncomposition to that of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (see Figure B1.10). In addition, the physical \n\nmixture of PhC18PMO and amorphous alumina is made in the same ratio obtained for the \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 composite. This is possible having into account the weight gain presented \n\nin Table 4.1.1. The mixture of PhC18PMO with amorphous alumina is here denoted as \n\nPhC18PMO+Al2O3_a and was tested for the CH4 and CO2 adsorption at 25 \u00b0C. It is possible \n\nto observe that PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 and a larger quantity \n\nof CH4 when compared with Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.11a). The presence of nearly  \n\n25 % of amorphous alumina induces a negative effect in the CO2 adsorption in the \n\nPhC18PMO. In addition the selectivity for PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a, presented in Figure B1.11b, \n\nis about 1.86 at 500 kPa, while the PhC18PMO presents a selectivity of approximately 4 and \n\nthe Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents a selectivity of 13 at the same range of pressure. Furthermore \n\nthe PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a showed the worst separation performance among all materials \n\n(Figure B1.12a) and the equimolar composition in the adsorbed phase is achieved at about \n\n0.70 molar composition of methane in the gas phase, at 500 kPa and 25 \u00b0C (Figure B1.12b), \n\nwhich is significantly lower than those observed for the other materials tested. Having into \n\naccount the performance of PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a material on the CO2 adsorption, the \n\npresence of the same alumina/PhC18PMO ratio and same chemical composition achieved for \n\nthe Al-PhC18PMO#50, it is possible to conclude that the use of ALD to deposit alumina in \n\nthe PhC18PMO powder brings benefits for the CO2/CH4 separation. This can be due to a \n\ngood dispersion of nanoparticles of amorphous alumina that is achieved with the ALD \n\nmethod not only in the surface, but also inside the pores of Al-PhC18PMO#50, probably \n\npromoting some roughness and microporosity. The interactions of the alumina and the gas \n\nmolecules are then increased, since the alumina particles are very small. Another \n\nconsequence of this type of deposition is the eventual chemical reaction of some alumina \n\nwith some of the T2 free silanols of PhC18PMO giving rise to some Si-O-Al chemical bonds. \n\nIn this way, the ALD allows the deposition of amorphous alumina on the PhC18PMO, in \n\norder to produce composites with interesting physical and chemical characteristics to be \n\nselective in the CO2/CH4 separation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n137 \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Comparison to other materials \n\nThe capacity of Al-PhC18PMO#50 to capture carbon dioxide and methane is compared in \n\nTable 4.1.4 with the capacities reported for other types of adsorbents. Notice that data were \n\ndetermined at different temperatures, thus, some differences on the values of the capacities \n\ncan be due to the temperature. \n\n \nTable 4.1.4. Capacities of different adsorbents in the CO2/CH4 separation at 100 kPa. \n\naSelectivity at 100 kPa. bThis value correspond to the CO2/CH4 capacity ratio.  \n \n\nThe Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents slightly better results in the CO2 and CH4 adsorption \n\ncapacities than PILC-AlB and PILCw. The Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents at 100 kPa a \n\nselectivity of 9 which is lightly smaller than the selectivity reported for the PILCs at the \n\nsame range of pressure. Although, the selectivity of the Al-PhC18PMO#50 increases with \n\nthe pressure and at near of 1000 kPa these materials has a selectivity of 15 while the \n\nselectivity of these PILCs remains constant in the all range of pressure (100-1000 kPa). The \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 adsorbs less CO2 than PCH clay, SC700P activated carbon,  \n\namino-MIL-53(Al) and MIL-53(Al) pellets (Basolite\u00ae A100) MOFs and a-MCMBs Silicas, \n\nbut it is much superior in selectivity. The ZIF-7 is the only material that presents better CO2 \n\nadsorption and selectivity at the same temperature and pressure.

The meso-structure order and \n\nmolecular-scale periodicity of the pore walls of PhC18PMO are preserved after modification \n\nof high Al content (Al-PhC18PMO#100 with [Si/Al] = 0.94). The ALD method allows \n\nincreasing the amount of the Al2O3 on the composite varying the number of cycles, proving \n\nto be a robust method for tailoring the content of Al2O3 amount on the PhC18PMO. The \n\nreduction of the surface area and pore volume is observed with the increase of Al content. \n\nIn the case of a large number of ALD cycles (i.e., 50), the formation of AlV aluminium oxide \n\nspecies is observed. The acidity of these species is most probably responsible for the \n\nobserved increase in the CO2/CH4 separation selectivity. The Al-PhC18PMO#50 sample has \n\ninteresting properties for application into methane purification (upgrading and sweetening) \n\nthat is essential before bio and natural gas commercialization. The regeneration of the \n\nmodified materials was easy under vacuum and showed good stability. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n139 \n\n \n\n4.2 Carbonization of periodic mesoporous phenylene- and  \n\nbiphenylene-silicas for CO2/CH4 separation \n\n \n\n \n\nAdapted from: \n\nMirtha A.

I also carried out the experimental CO2 and CH4 pure adsorption measurements at \n\nthe University of Lisbon using a volumetric apparatus, under guidance of Mois\u00e9s L. Pinto \n\nand Jo\u00e3o Pires. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n140 \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Motivation \n\nPeriodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials have been proposed as potential \n\nadsorbents due to their high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and good thermal \n\nstability.[22,39,40] These materials also allow good diffusion of the molecules through the \n\nchannels, since the organic functions are integrated within the walls. Moreover, PMO \n\ncharacteristics can be tuned by changing the bissilylated organic bridge and the template \n\nmolecule, which define the type of porous structure and the pore size[20] as it was seen in  \n\nSub-chapter 3.1. The introduction of amino groups into the organic bridge has been one of \n\nthe ways to improve selectivity of PMOs towards CO2 adsorption[1] as we could observe in \n\nSub-chapters 3.1 and 3.2. Additionally, alkyl amine groups have been grafted to the free \n\nsilanols at the PMO hydrophilic part[41] as demonstrated in Sub-chapter 3.2. The addition of \n\naluminium oxide to the PMO surface using atomic layer deposition makes the phenylene-\n\nPMO (PhC18PMO) was effective for the CO2/CH4 separation as could be observed in the \n\nprevious Sub-chapter 4.1. Despite all the attempts to improve efficiency of PMOs for CO2 \n\nadsorption, thus improving its separation from CH4, significant additional work is required \n\nin order to make them competitive with zeolites and activated carbons in terms of capacity \n\nand cost efficiency. Therefore, in the present work the surface and structural properties of \n\nPMOs are modified through pyrolysis with the aim of improving their capabilities for gas \n\nadsorption and gas separation applications. PMOs with two different aromatic bridges, \n\nphenylene and biphenylene moieties were prepared. The carbonized PMOs were prepared \n\nusing two different structure-directing agents (C12-TMA and C18-TMA) in order to obtain \n\ndifferent pore sizes. As the alkyl chain length of the surfactant and the nature of the bridge \n\nof PMOs were varied, it was studied their influence on the morphology, on the surface \n\nproperties (surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and particle type) and on the \n\nthermal stability of the prepared PMOs. The pyrolysis process was made on the as-\n\nsynthetized PMOs (with surfactant within the channels) and on the surfactant-extracted \n\nPMOs, at two different temperatures (800 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C) under inert conditions. \n\nAdditionally, PMOs were chemically modified before pyrolysis, aiming to improve the \n\ncapacity and selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation. \n\nThis study is focused on the understanding of the physical and chemical modifications \n\npromoted in the aromatic bridged PMO materials as a consequence of the carbonization \n\nprocess and the concomitant effects in the CO2 capacity and CO2/CH4 selectivity. To the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n141 \n\n \n\nbest of our knowledge, only the pyrolysis of non-aromatic PMOs was reported in the  \n\nliterature[42\u201348] and none of such pyrolysed materials was tested for the CO2/CH4 separation. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Experimental details \n\nPMO synthesis \n\nThe phenylene[20,22] (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1) and biphenylene[49] bridged PMOs were \n\nsynthesized according to the literature procedures, starting by with the hydrolysis and \n\ncondensation of bissilylated precursors in the presence of supramolecular structure agent, \n\nthe C18-TMA or C12-TMA. After 24 hours of stirring at room temperature, the solution was \n\ntransferred to Teflon-lined stain-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 \u00b0C. After \n\n24 hours, the solid was filtered and washed. The as-prepared materials are denoted as \n\nPhCnPMO_AS or BphCnPMO_AS, where n is the number of carbons of the alkyl chain of \n\nthe selected surfactant. The templates were removed using an ethanol/HCl solution, giving \n\nrise to PhCnPMO and BphCnPMO materials. The introduction of the amino group into the \n\nphenylene moieties (to obtain NH2PhC12PMO) was made upon two-step treatment with very \n\nstrong acid solutions of HNO3 and H2SO4 and also of SnCl2 and HCl using the procedure \n\nreported by Ohashi et al.[1] \n\n \nCarbonization of PMOs \n\nThe prepared PMOs materials were carbonized in an alumina crucible at 800 \u00b0C or 1200 \u00b0C \n\nunder nitrogen atmosphere. The pyrolysis was performed in two steps. Initially the \n\ntemperature was raised up to 200 \u00b0C using a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1. The materials were \n\nkept at this temperature over 2 hours. Then, the temperature was increased at 5 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1 till \n\nit reaches the final temperature (800 or 1200 \u00b0C), at which the material was maintained for \n\n2 h. Natural cooling to the room temperature was made under nitrogen flow. The pyrolysed \n\nPMOs are denoted by the suffix PT, where P means pyrolysed material and T indicates the \n\ntemperature of the carbonization process (T = 800 or 1200 \u00b0C). \n\nIn the case of the PMO submitted to acid chemical treatment, the materials were previously \n\nheated with the H2SO4 at 160 \u00b0C during 6 h and then carbonized at 800 \u00b0C. \n\n \nMaterials characterization \n\nThe properties of the carbonized PMOs were assessed by PXRD, -196 \u00b0C N2 sorption, TEM, \n\nFTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies and TGA \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n142 \n\n \n\nanalysis. TEM, N2-sorption isotherms, 13C CP-MAS NMR, TGA, EA and some CO2 and \n\nCH4 adsorption data can be assessed in the Appendix B. \n\n \nHigh pressure CO2 and CH4 adsorption \n\nAdsorption experiments of CO2 and CH4 were performed at 25 \u00b0C up to 1000 kPa, using the \n\nvolumetric method presented in the previous Chapter (Sub-chapter 2.6). The non-ideality of \n\nthe gas phase was taken into account through the use of the second and third virial \n\ncoefficients. Additionally, the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the \n\nabsolute adsorbed amounts having into account the pore volume of the each sample and the \n\ndensity of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Each experimental pure component \n\nadsorption isotherm was fitted using the Virial model. Selectivity values were estimated \n\nusing a method proposed by Myers34 and the implementation is described in detail in \n\nprevious works35. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Results and discussion \n0 \n\nThe surfactant-extracted PMOs, PhC18PMO (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1), PhC12PMO  \n\n(c.f. Chapter 3) and BphC18PMO[50] possess 2D hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice with d \n\nspacings associated to the (100) reflection (c.f. Figure 4.2.1) of 4.65, 3.59 and 4.96 nm, \n\nrespectively (Table B2.1 in the Appendix B). These materials also present molecular-scale \n\nperiodicity observed by the presence of a medium range reflection at d ? 0.76 nm for the  \n\nPhCnPMOs (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1) and at 1.19 nm for the BphC18PMO[50]. The as-prepared \n\nand surfactant-extracted PMO materials were pyrolysed at 800 \u00b0C. The two most promising \n\nmaterials were further pyrolysed at 1200 \u00b0C. The structural order of the carbonized samples \n\nwere studied by PXRD, TEM and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. Figure 4.2.1 also \n\nshows the PXRD patterns of the pyrolysed samples. It is possible to observe that all materials \n\npreserved the (100) reflection, indicating that the meso-scale periodicity is preserved after \n\nthe pyrolysis conditions. The materials PhC18PMO_P800, PhC12PMO_P800 and \n\nBphC18PMO_P800 have d spacings of 4.09, 3.27 and 4.20 nm, respectively (Table B2.1). \n\nThe slightly reduction of the d spacing values on the pyrolysed samples is compatible with \n\nthe reduction of the pore diameter during the pyrolysis process at 800 \u00b0C. The use of the \n\nsurfactant, the increase of temperature to 1200 \u00b0C or even the use of H2SO4 chemical \n\ntreatment before carbonization leads to a reduction of intensity of the (100) reflection in the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n143 \n\n \n\nPRXD. This reduction is more pronounced for the materials pyrolysed at 1200 \u00b0C and may \n\nindicate a partial collapse of the porous structure. The medium-range reflections at d ~ 0.76 \n\nand 1.19 nm can be observed in the PXRD pattern of phenylene- and biphenylene- PMOs, \n\nrespectively, after pyrolysis at 800 \u00b0C. The phenylene-PMO treated at higher temperature \n\n(PhC12PMO_P1200) does not present this reflection, pointing to the loss of the molecular-\n\nscale periodicity after such hard conditions. However, in the case of the biphenylene-PMO \n\nthe molecular-scale periodicity peak is always present in the diffraction patterns even after \n\ntreatment at 1200 \u00b0C.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.1. X-ray diffraction patterns of pyrolysed PMO materials: a) phenylene-PMOs; and  \nb) biphenylene-PMOs. \n \n\nTEM images of pyrolysed PMOs are showed in Figure B2.1 in the Appendix B. TEM images \n\nof PhC18PMO_P800 and the PhC12PMO_P800 show high order of the pores along the \n\nchannel direction. Additionally, both materials show the hexagonal arrangement of the pores \n\nand present particles with elongated form such as the parent PMOs. Interesting, the use of \n\nsurfactant during the pyrolysis process and the use of amine linked to the phenylene moieties \n\nof the PhC12PMO gives rise to carbonized materials with lower mesoporous organization \n\nthan the PhC12PMO_P800, corroborating the PXRD results. Moreover, the \n\nPhC12PMO_AS_P800 and NH2PhC12PMO_P800 present particles with both elongated and \n\nspherical shapes. The increase of the pyrolysed temperature from 800 to 1200 \u00b0C \n\n(PhC12PMO_P1200) leads to the appearance of smaller particles.

Furthermore, the \n\nTEM image in the direction parallel to the channels of the BphC18PMO_P1200 supports the \n\nmaintenance of the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the pores. Curiously, the shape of the \n\nparticles of these materials change with the temperature. The parent biphenylene-PMO \n\npresents particles with helical form,[50] but during the heating process at 800 \u00b0C under inert \n\natmosphere, the BphC18PMO_P800 starts showing particles with spherical shape. The \n\nspherical particles are more evident on biphenylene-PMOs carbonized under extreme \n\nconditions (pyrolysis at 1200 \u00b0C or at 800 \u00b0C in the presence of the surfactant). \n\nThe N2 adsorption\u2013desorption experiments of carbonized PMOs are presented in  \n\nFigure B2.2 in the Appendix B, and the pore size distribution (PSD) curves are showed in \n\nFigure 4.2.2. The free surfactant parent PMOs, PhC18PMO (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1), PhC12PMO  \n\n(c.f. Chapter3) and BphC18PMO[50] samples display type IV isotherms (IUPAC \n\nclassification),[51] as shown previously, typically detected on conventional mesoporous \n\nmaterials. In Figure B2.2, it is possible to observe that the PhC18PMO_P800 presents a type \n\nIV isotherm similar to what happens with the parent material. A slightly reduction of the \n\nBrunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET)[52,53] specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vp) \n\ncan be observed after pyrolysis, but a significant decrease of the pore diameter (dp) from \n\n3.70 to 3.02 nm is evident (Table B2.1). The presence of microporosity was also studied by \n\napplying the t-plot method to the N2 adsorption curve of the material. In the case of \n\nPhC18PMO_P800 signs of microporosity were not observed. Since difficulties in applying \n\nthe t-plot method to type IV isotherms are common,[51] the quenched solid density functional \n\ntheory (QSDFT)[54,55] was then applied to the N2 adsorption isotherm of the pyrolysed PMOs \n\nto evaluate both micro- and meso-pores size distribution, as represented in Figure 4.2.2. \n\nFigure 4.2.2a shows that the pyrolysis of PhC18PMO at 800 \u00b0C originates a material with \n\ndifferent types of porosities. Two mesopore sizes are obtained at ca. 3.4 nm (in small \n\namount) and at ca. 2.1 nm (in major quantity). The pore diameter around 1.1 nm is assigned \n\nto the presence of micropores. In the case of PhC12PMO the carbonization at 800 \u00b0C leads \n\nto a material with an isotherm that resembles a type Ib isotherm, typical of microporous \n\nmaterials with wide micropores and possibly narrow mesopores (Figure B2.2), which agrees \n\nwith the pore size distribution that displays mainly pores around 1.1 nm (Figure 4.2.2a). \n\nInterestingly, the PhC12PMO_P800 presents a reduction of SBET, but an increase of Vp when \n\ncompared to the parent PhC12PMO (Table B2.1) that could eventually be ascribed to the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n145 \n\n \n\ndecrease in the particle size. The effect of the surfactant presence within the channels of the \n\nPhC12PMO during the pyrolysis at 800 \u00b0C is minimal. Both PhC12PMO_P800 and \n\nPhC12PMO_AS_P800 display similar PSD curves (Figure 4.2.2a). Nevertheless, \n\nPhC12PMO_AS_P800 presents higher SBET and Vp and lower Vmicro than the \n\nPhC12PMO_P800 material (Table B2.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.2. Pore size distribution profiles calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm of \ncarbonized: a) phenylene-PMOs and b) biphenylene-PMOs. The PSD curves were calculated using \nthe QSDFT method for carbon surfaces. \n \n\nThe presence of amines in the phenylene moieties of PhC12PMO also produces a material \n\nwith an isotherm similar to a type Ib isotherm[51] after pyrolysis, but with a more pronounced \n\nreduction of SBET, Vp and Vmicro than the sample without amine groups (please compare \n\nNH2PhC12PMO_P800 and PhC12PMO_P800 samples in Figure 4.2.2a and Table B2.1). The \n\nreduction of the specific surface area and of the pore volumes may result from the collapse \n\nof some pores during the pyrolysis[42] and/or may occur by the presence of amines, which \n\nincrease the reactivity of the material upon carbonization of the phenylene moieties to form \n\ncarbon[56] giving rise to silica/carbon framework. When the carbonization of the organic \n\nmoieties is fast, the free carbon can be deposited on the pores leading to their blockage. Note, \n\nthat the presence of amines during the pyrolysis process originated smaller micropores,  \n\nFigure 4.2.2a.

A reduction of the SBET and Vmicro is also observed when the \n\ntemperature is increased (Table B2.1). \n\nThe textural properties of pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs were also studied and are represented \n\nin Figure 4.2.2b. Similarly to the results obtained for the pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs, it is \n\nverified a contraction of the pore structure upon pyrolysis of biphenylene-PMOs  \n\n(Figure 4.2.2b and Table B2.1). The pyrolysis of BphC18PMO at 800 \u00b0C gives rise to a \n\nmaterial with a isotherm resembling a type Ib isotherm although with some type II character \n\n(Figure B2.2), and presenting higher SBET, but lower Vp and dp than the parent material  \n\n(c.f. Table B2.1). The shrinkage of the pores is observed in Figure 4.2.2b, where the \n\nBphC18PMO_P800 shows mainly micropores. The observed micropores in this material \n\nvaries between 1 and 2 nm, with maxima of pore size distributions centered at 1.0 nm and \n\n1.7 nm. The presence of the surfactant (BphC18PMO_P800_AS) only promotes a reduction \n\nof the SBET and Vp of the sample when compared to the BphC18PMO_P800 materials  \n\n(Table B2.1). This can be related to the carbonization of the surfactant species at 800 \u00b0C \n\nremaining inside the pores, which eventually leads to their obstruction. Interestingly, and \n\nopposite to the observed for the pyrolysed phenylene-PMO samples, it is possible to perceive \n\na slightly increase in the Vmicro. The increase in the microporosity when the surfactant is \n\npresent in the BphC18PMO_P800 material (c.f. compare Vmicro of BphC18PMO_P800_AS \n\nand BphC18PMO_P800 in the Table B2.1) during the pyrolysis process can be associated to \n\nthe formation of smaller micropores during the surfactant carbonization (c.f. Figure 4.2.2b, \n\nBphC18PMO_P800 material presents micropores with 1.0 nm while the \n\nBphC18PMO_P800_AS sample has micropores with 0.9 nm). Curiously, the chemical attack \n\nof BphC18PMO with H2SO4 before pyrolysis also stimulates a reduction of SBET and Vp and \n\nan increase of the Vmicro. Thus, the BphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800 has more micropores  \n\n(Table B2.1) and they are faintly smaller than those observed in the BphC18PMO_P800,  \n\n(Figure 4.2.2b). The increase of the temperature from 800 \u00b0C to 1200 \u00b0C has higher impact \n\nin the formation of a material with more micropores than the use of surfactant or the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n147 \n\n \n\nconsideration of chemical attack by sulfuric acid before pyrolysis. In this way, \n\nBphC18PMO_P1200 is the carbonized biphenylene-PMO material with the highest Vmicro \n\nprepared in this study (Table B2.1). The reduction verified on the micropore size  \n\n(Figure 4.2.2b) is in agreement with the progressive contraction of structure upon increasing \n\ntemperature treatment. These results are in line with the deviation of the d100 reflection for \n\nhigher 2? values in the PXRD shown in Figure 4.2.1. \n\nSolid-state 29Si CP-MAS NMR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of pyrolysed PMOs \n\nmaterials are shown in Figures 4.2.3 and Figure B2.3 in the Appendix B, respectively. The  \n29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PhCnPMO (Chapter 3 and Appendix A) and \n\nBphC18PMO[50] display resonances at ca. -81, -70 and -61 ppm which are attributed to T3, \n\nT2 and T1 organosiliceous species of the type Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m, respectively. In both \n\nparent PMO materials no peaks endorsed to Qn [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] chemical \n\nenvironments were detected. After pyrolysis of the materials, the patterns of the 29Si NMR \n\nspectra became considerably noisy, displaying in general broader peaks. This observation \n\nmay be related with the partial formation of graphitic carbon species known to be \n\nparamagnetic. Moreover, the pyrolysis treatment promotes Si-C cleavages observed by the \n\nappearance of Qn chemical environments. Although, different degrees of Si-C cleavage are \n\nobserved when the pyrolysis conditions are varied. The phenylene-PMOs with different pore \n\nsizes originate similar ratios of Tm: Qn species after pyrolysis at 800 \u00b0C. The presence of \n\namines and/or surfactant molecules, and the increase of the temperature from 800 to  \n\n1200 \u00b0C give rise, in the phenylene-PMO, to an increase of the Qn species, which indicates \n\nan enhancement of the cleavage of the Si-C bonds within these conditions. The presence of \n\nsurfactant inside the channels of the biphenylene-PMO samples does not intensify the Si-C \n\nbond cleavage. Contrarily, the use of sulfuric acid to promote dehydration or the increase of \n\ntemperature from 800 to 1200 \u00b0C promote the formation of larger amount of Qn species, \n\nwhich means that these extreme conditions stimulate the cleavage of the Si-C bonds. \n\nSolid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of the pristine PhCnPMO materials present a typical \n\nresonance at 133 ppm of the aromatic carbons as reported in Chapter 3. In the case of the \n\nparent BphC18PMO the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra exhibit resonances at ca. 126, 130, 135 \n\nand 141 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons, which are related with the biphenylene group.[50] \n\nTiny peaks can be detected in the region 0 to 50 ppm. Figure B2.3 in the Appendix B shows \n\nthat the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs samples carbonized at 800 \u00b0C only display one \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n148 \n\n \n\nbroad resonance at ca. 132 ppm (Figure B2.3b, d and f) and at ca. 129 ppm (Figure B2.3h), \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.3. 29Si MAS (left) and CP-MAS (right) NMR spectra of A) phenylene-pyrolysed PMOs: \na) PhC18PMO; b) PhC18PMO_P800; c) PhC12PMO; d) PhC12PMO_AS_P800; e) PhC12PMO_P800;  \nf) PhC12PMO_P1200; g) NH2PhC12PMO; and h) NH2PhC12PMO_P800, and B) biphenylene-\npyrolysed PMOs materials: a) BphC18PMO; b) BphC18PMO_AS_P800; c) BphC18PMO_P800;  \nd) BphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800; and e) BphC18PMO_P1200. \n \n\n-150-100-500\n\n?

The parent PhCnPMOs (c.f. Chapter 3) and \n\nBphC18PMO[50] materials are stable up to 550 \u00b0C. After pyrolysis, all PMOs are found to be \n\nthermally stable up to ca. 300 \u00b0C as observed by TGA (Figure B2.4). The first weight loss, \n\noccurring below 100 \u00b0C in all materials, is associated to desorption of physisorbed water. \n\nThen, at 300 \u00b0C most of the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs present an increase of weight \n\nthat is related to the oxidation of carbon in oxygen atmosphere. This effect is more \n\npronounced in phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs treated at 1200 \u00b0C. Above 300\u00b0C, the \n\ndecomposition and release of the organic moieties from the framework take place, which \n\nhappens at lower temperatures than in the parent PMOs. This lowering in the temperature \n\nfor the release of organic moieties is compatible with the breakage of Si-C bonds as \n\nsuggested above. \n\nTable B2.2 in the Appendix B presents the elemental analysis results of the pyrolysed PMO \n\nmaterials, demonstrating the significant reduction on C and H content comparatively to the \n\nparent PhCnPMOs (c.f. Chapter 3) and parent BphC18PMO[50]. This loss probably occurs due \n\nto some carbonization of the organic bridges and consequently volatilization of the burnt \n\nproducts. Furthermore, both NH2PhC12PMO_P800 and BphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800 have the \n\nmajor loss of C amount on the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs carbonized materials, \n\nmeaning that the chemical attack of the bridges before carbonization facilitated the burnt of \n\nthe chemical species. Comparatively to the parent NH2PhC12PMO (c.f. Chapter 3), the \n\namount of N in the case of the NH2PhC12PMO_P800 material is decreased, which suggests \n\noccurrence of C-N bond cleavage during the carbonization. Additionally, the pyrolysis of \n\nboth as-synthetized PMOs (PhC12PMO_AS_P800 and BphC18PMO_AS_P800) do not lead \n\nto materials with representative nitrogen content, meaning that the surfactant is somehow \n\nlost during the process. \n\nFigure 4.2.4 presents the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of both \n\nNH2PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO_P800, in order to observe which kind of amines are \n\ninto the PMO material after the pyrolysis. Signals of Si 2p, Si 2s, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s were \n\nobserved in the XPS spectrum of both samples (c.f. Figure 4.2.4). It can be seen in  \n\nFigure 4.2.4a that the N 1s signal appears at 400.36 eV, which corresponds to the N atom in \n\nthe amino groups (NH2) linked to the phenylene moieties of the NH2PhC12PMO material. \n\nThis material also shows ?* features in the range above of ~ 405 eV, that can be related to \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n150 \n\n \n\nits highly conjugated character (?-?*). Note, that this signal at higher binding energies is \n\nfrequently observed in the C 1s, O 1s and S 2p regions of materials with poor electrical \n\nconductivity (which is the case) and can be associated to the existence of zones of different \n\nconductivity resulting from X-ray irradiation and differential charge accumulation in the \n\nsurface of the material. In the case of the NH2PhC12PMO_P800 material (c.f. Figure 4.2.4b), \n\nthe N 1s signal appears at 400.58 eV (which is similar to the value obtained for the \n\nNH2PhC12PMO), indicating that the N atom remains mainly in the form of amino group. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.4.

The evaluation \n\nof the surface interaction of each materials with pure CO2 and pure CH4 at low coverage was \n\nmade through the determination of the Henry\u2019s constant (KH) using the Virial model. The \n\nfitting parameters for the Virial model are presented in Table 4.2.1. \n\nFigure 4.2.5a shows the CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms of each pyrolysed  \n\nphenylene-PMO.

Thus, any modification on the pyrolysis \n\nconditions (increase of the pore size, use of template, incorporation of amines in the \n\nphenylene moieties or increase of temperature) gives rise to materials with less CO2 \n\nadsorption capacity (Figure 4.2.5a and Table B2.2). The PhC18PMO_P800 and \n\nPhC12PMO_P1200 are the materials demonstrating lower CO2 adsorption in the range of \n\npressure considered and present the smallest KH values ((0.36 x 10-2 and 0.34 x 10-2 mmol\u00b7g-\n\n1\u00b7kPa-1, respectively, Table 4.2.1) for the materials considered in this work. Curiously, the \n\nPhC18PMO_P800 does not present Vmicro and the PhC12PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed \n\nphenylene material with the lowest amount of micropores from the C12 family (Table B2.1). \n\nAdditionally, these materials have a significant amount of mesopores, indicating that this \n\ntype of pores is not beneficial for CO2 adsorption. \n\nAs observed for the adsorption of CO2, the PhC12PMO_P800 is also the material which \n\nadsorbs more CH4 at high pressures, but presents one of the lowest KH  \n\n(0.21 x 10-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1) found in this study. The use of the surfactant, the introduction \n\nof amines in the phenylene bridge, and the increase of pyrolysis temperature promote an \n\nincrease of KH. Thus, PhC12PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed phenylene-PMO presenting the \n\nhighest KH (0.30 x 10-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1). Interestingly, a relation between the microporosity \n\nof the pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs and the CH4 adsorption was found: materials with the \n\nlowest Vmicro tend to present improved properties to adsorb more CH4 than materials with \n\nhighest Vmicro. \n\nFigure 4.2.5b shows the CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms for carbonized  \n\nbiphenylene-PMOs. The BphC18PMO_P800 presents similar CO2 adsorptive properties and \n\nthe same KH relatively to its phenylene counterpart (Table 4.2.1). Remarkably, the \n\nBphC18PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed biphenylene-PMO with the best CO2 adsorptive \n\nproperties and the highest KH (2.34 x 10-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1) of this family of materials and \n\nalso of all PMOs materials prepared in this study.  \n\nThe enhancement of the pyrolysis temperature of biphenylene-PMOs improves the CO2 \n\nadsorption. This result is in the opposite direction to what was observed in the case of \n\nmaterial PhC12PMO_P1200, c.f. Table 4.2.1. \n\nThe increase of temperature from 800 to 1200 \u00b0C may intensify the formation of micropores \n\non the structure of BphC18PMO_P1200, favouring the CO2 adsorption (Figure 4.2.1 and  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n152 \n\n \n\nTable B2.1). In the case of CH4 adsorption, the pyrolysed biphenylene-PMO shows a \n\ndifferent behaviour. BphC18PMO_P800 is the material which adsorbs more CH4 in all \n\npressure range, with a KH of 0.59 x 10-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1. The pyrolysis of the BphC18PMO \n\ncontaining surfactant within the pores results in a material presenting inferior CH4 adsorption \n\nperformance (Figure 4.2.5b and Table 4.2.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.5.

Thus, the increase of Vmicro on the pyrolysed \n\nbiphenylene-PMOs reduces the CH4 adsorption performance (Table 4.2.1 and Table B2.1). \n\nIn general, the increase of microporosity on the pyrolysed PMOs improves the CO2 \n\nadsorption properties and diminishes the CH4 adsorption behaviour. This is in agreement \n\nwith results found on carbon-based adsorbents where it was found that narrow micropores \n\nfavours CO2 adsorption while large micropores are more suitable for CH4  \n\nadsorption.[34,57\u201359] \n\nThe selectivity of the separation and the equilibrium phase diagrams are also determined in \n\nthis study from the analysis of the adsorption data using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution \n\nTheory[27], by fitting the Virial equation to the pure-component isotherms and also by using \n\nthe method proposed by Myers[25,26,60]. Figure 4.2.6 shows the differences in the selectivities \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n154 \n\n \n\ndisplayed for the CO2/CH4 separation by pyrolysed PMO adsorbents. The differences \n\nbetween the values of selectivity can be quite large. In fact, the BphC18PMO_P1200 \n\nadsorbent has superior selectivity (9.5 at 500 kPa) to all other pyrolysed phenylene- or \n\nbiphenylene-PMOs. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.6. Average selectivity for the CO2/CH4 separation on the different pyrolysed PMOs at  \n25 \u00b0C. \n \n\nPhC12PMO_P800 displays a selectivity of 4.6 at 500 kPa. It is noteworthy that the materials \n\nwith the highest selectivity on the CO2/CH4 separation are the materials with highest \n\nmicroporosity of each PMO family. Curiously, the amount of micropores (Vmicro) on the \n\nmaterial is not directly proportional to the CO2 and CH4 adsorption ability and also to the \n\nselectivity to separate these gases. This means that behind the microporosity factor there are \n\nother potential features influencing the CO2 and CH4 adsorption namely the pore diameter \n\nand the chemical nature of the moieties. \n\nThe ability of the materials to separate CO2 and CH4 can be also estimated by the ratio of \n\nthe KH values, determined for CO2 and CH4 adsorption on each adsorbent experimentally \n\nconsidered in this work (c.f. Table 4.2.1). The results obtained present the same trend as \n\nobserved before. The biggest ratio was determined for BphC18PMO_P1200, which seems to \n\nbe the most remarkable adsorbent for CO2/CH4 separation. \n\nFigure 4.2.7 demonstrates the influence of all variables on the separation, where the \n\nBphC18PMO_P1200 presents slightly improved behaviour than PhC12PMO_P800. \n\nFurthermore, these two adsorbents present better results than any other PMO prepared in \n\nthis study. \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nS\ne\n\nle\nc\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\np (kPa)\n\nPhC18PMO_P800\n\nPhC12 PMO AS 800\n\nPhC12PMO_P800\n\nPhC12PMO_P1200\n\nNH2PhC12PMO_P800\n\nBphC18PMO_AS 800\n\nDphC18PMO-P800\n\nDphC18PMO+H2SO4_P800\n\nDphC18PMO-P1200\n\nPhC18PMO_P800\n\nPhC12PMO_AS_P800\n\nPhC12PMO_P800\n\nPhC12PMO_P1200\n\nNH2PhC12PMO_P800\n\nBphC18PMO_AS_P800\n\nBphC18PMO_P800\n\nBphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800\n\nBphC18PMO_P1200\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n155 \n\n \n\nHaving into account a 0.5 molar composition of methane (yCH4), which is a realistic value \n\nfor biogas composition and for some natural gas sources, the composition in the adsorbed \n\nphase (xCH4) is 0.08 on BphC18PMO_P1200 and 0.15 on PhC12PMO_P800, at 500 kPa and \n\n25 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.7.

The reduction of pore size \n\nto micro-pores is the most significant difference observed when compared with the \n\nunpyrolysed materials, but the surface areas and the particles size are also smaller. \n\nInteresting, the highest carbonization temperature; the presence of the surfactant and amine \n\ngroups; and the use of H2SO4 during the carbonization process lead to the production of \n\nmaterials with small pore size and high amount of micropores.

Herein, it is reported the first example of the N-alkylation of the periodic mesoporous \n\nphenylene silica with an amino group at the aromatic ring. It is also a novelty the use of \n\nmicrowave irradiation in the functionalization of PMO materials. There are only few reports \n\nusing the microwave-assisted synthesis in PMOs, most in the preparation of the PMO \n\nmaterial.[8\u201310] Smeulders et al.[8] demonstrated that this unconventional fast heating approach \n\nkept unchanged the structure of this kind of hybrid materials during the hydrothermal step \n\nsynthesis. Additionally, when compared with the conventional synthesis, the usage of \n\nmicrowave irradiation promoted narrower distribution of pore sizes, higher surface area and \n\nlarger pore volumes.[8] \n\nDue to the dielectric heating, chemical reactions under microwave radiation generally occur \n\nmuch faster.[11] Molecules possessing a permanent dipole moment tend to become aligned \n\nwith the microwave electromagnetic field and, during this motion, they suffer frictions and \n\ncollisions, with consequent heat generation. The efficiency of microwave heating is strongly \n\ndependent on the dielectric properties and on the relaxation times of the reaction components \n\n(namely reactants, functional groups and solvents).[12\u201314] Additionally, as the majority of the \n\nmicrowave ovens work at 2.45 GHz, the molecules exposed to this radiation are able to \n\ngenerate a strong internal heat with a heating rate up to 10 \u00b0C per second. Using conventional \n\nheating, the temperature of the surface of the reaction vessel becomes higher than its internal \n\ntemperature and the transfer of the heating is made via thermal conduction. Therefore, the \n\nmicrowave radiation is a non-contact heating source allowing a more selective and effective \n\nheating than the conventional sources. Reaction vessels can be chosen to permit the \n\nmicrowave energy to go through it and heat only the reactants. Specific microwave effects \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n164 \n\n \n\ncan also occur during the reaction due to the presence of polar molecules in the mixture or \n\nif the polarity of the transition state is higher than the polarity of the ground state.[15,16] \n\nThis work combines the know-how obtained from the organic and inorganic chemistry to \n\ndevelop the PMO materials that even after one decade of research remains largely \n\nunderexploited. A microwave-assisted reaction used in organic synthesis for the \n\nmonoalkylation of aniline[17] is adapted to the functionalization of NH2PhC18PMO to achieve \n\nthe N-alkylation of the amine group as depicted in Figure 5.1.1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.1. Schematic representation of the synthesis of iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. \n \n\n5.1.2 Experimental details \n\nMaterials synthesis \n\nThe phenylene PMO (PhC18PMO) was obtained following the literature procedures[18\u201320] by \n\nhydrolysis and condensation of home-made BTEB precursor[21] in the presence of \n\noctadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant template (C18-TMA). After synthesis the \n\ntemplate was extracted by an ethanol/HCl solution. The incorporation of functional amino \n\ngroups into the phenylene rings was achieved upon treatment with very strong acid solutions \n\nof HNO3\u2013H2SO4 and SnCl2\u2013HCl using the same procedure of Inagaki et al.[7] The final \n\nmaterial is denoted NH2PhC18PMO. The N-alkylation of NH2PhC18PMO was carried out by \n\ntwo reaction cycles under microwave irradiation. To a suspension of NH2PhC18PMO  \n\n(278 mg) in acetonitrile (3 mL), 2-bromopropane (285 mg) and KI (40 mg) were added. A \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n165 \n\n \n\nvial containing the previous mixture was then sealed and heated at 170 \u00b0C for 20 minutes in \n\na CEM Discovery SP microwave. The reacted powder was filtered, washed successively \n\nwith CH2Cl2 (20 mL), NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution), brine and dried overnight at \n\n60 \u00b0C. The dried powder was collected and subjected to a second reaction cycle in the same \n\nconditions as the first one but only with 70% of the initial 2-bromopropane quantity. The \n\nalkylated samples are denoted iPrNHPhC18PMO_C1 or iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 after cycle 1 \n\nor cycle 2, respectively. \n\n \nMaterials characterization \n\nThe physical, textural and chemical properties of the prepared PMO materials were \n\nevaluated by N2 sorption isotherms, TEM, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR,  \n13C CP-MAS and 15N CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The thermal stability of materials was \n\nevaluated by TGA. Description of the experimental conditions is presented at Chapter 2 and \n\nthe data obtained by PXRD, TEM, N2 sorption isotherms, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR and \n\nFTIR spectroscopies and TGA and EA analyses are presented in Appendix C. \n\n \n\n5.1.3 Results and discussion \n\nThe structural order and the textural physical properties before and after functionalization \n\nwere evaluated by PXRD, TEM and -196 \u00b0C N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. PXRD \n\npatterns of PhC18PMO, NH2PhC18PMO and iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 (Figure C1.1, Appendix \n\nC) reveal for all materials the first strong low-angle (100) reflection and the two much less \n\nintense (110) and (200) peaks, all characteristic for a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry \n\n(p6mm) lattice. The characteristic low angle diffraction peaks at d = 4.48 nm (in the pristine \n\nPhC18PMO material) and at d = 4.53 nm (after functionalization) (Table C1.1, Appendix C) \n\nallowed the calculation of the lattice parameter a (a = 2d100/?3), which is 5.17 nm and  \n\n5.23 nm for the as-synthesized and functionalized PhC18PMOs, respectively. The peaks at  \n\nd = 7.58 nm are due to the molecular-scale crystal-like structure. Both meso- and molecular-\n\nscale periodicities are preserved after amination and monoalkylation under microwave \n\nconditions and high temperatures. The TEM images (Figure C1.2, Appendix C) support the \n\norder along the channel for all materials. The inset in Figure C1.2d shows the hexagonal \n\narrangement of pores corroborating the 1D hexagonal structure of the N-alkylated \n\nPhC18PMO. The -196 \u00b0C N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and PSD curves (Figure C1.3, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n166 \n\n \n\nAppendix C) also confirm type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) for all materials with \n\nnarrow distribution of pore sizes as typically observed for conventional mesoporous \n\nmaterials such as MCM-41. The pore size profiles (Figure C1.3 and Table C1.1, Appendix \n\nC) suffer from a maximum shifting from 3.55 to 3.41 nm with the introduction of the \n\nisopropyl group into the amine. \n\nThe 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure 5.1.2) support the amination of the PhC18PMO and \n\nthe N-alkylation of amine moieties in NH2PhC18PMO. The pure PhC18PMO display the \n\ntypical resonance at 134 ppm of the aromatic carbons as reported in literature  \n\n(Figure 5.1.2a).[3,20] Small peaks can be observed in the region 0 to 50 ppm that are related \n\nto the presence of some non-extracted template. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.2. 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of a) PhC18PMO, b) NH2PhC18PMO,  \nc) iPrNHPhC18PMO_C1 and d) iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2.

The 15N NMR \n\nspectrum of NH2PhC18PMO (Figure 5.1.3a) presents a single peak at ca. -325 ppm, which \n\ncorresponds to the primary amine group (NH2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.3. 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra of a) NH2PhC18PMO, b) iPrNHPhC18PMO_C1 and  \nc) iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. \n \n\nAfter one cycle of N-alkylation, a new 15N resonance arises at ca. -292 ppm, associated to \n\nthe partial formation of secondary amine groups (Figure 5.1.3b). In a second cycle of \n\nalkylation, the 15N resonance at ca. -325 ppm is almost vanished, while the peak of the \n\nsecondary amine (-292 ppm), comparatively, increases in intensity (Figure 5.1.3c). \n\nThe 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of all materials are shown in Figure C1.4 \n\n(Appendix C). The parent PhC18PMO exhibits peaks at ca. 81, 71 and 61 ppm assigned to \n\nT3, T2 and T1 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m] organosiliceous species, respectively, as described \n\nin the literature[3,20]. The assignment of the faint T1 peak observed in the 29Si MAS NMR \n\nspectrum was further supported by the 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum where it appears \n\nenhanced. The amination of PhC18PMO produces significant changes in the spectra. The T1 \n\npeak almost disappears and the intensity of T2 decreases with respect to T3 sites. This means \n\nthat the high acid treatment promotes the further condensation of the free silanol groups. \n\nAfter N-alkylation of NH2PhC18PMO, a faint resonance in the region of the Qn species  \n\n[Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] is observed in the 29Si spectra of N-alkylated materials, which \n\nindicates a small amount of carbon-silicon bond cleavage during the N-alkylation reaction \n\n-400-350-300-250-200\n\n?

The functionalization of the PhC18PMO material was also \n\nfollowed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure C1.5, Appendix C). The presence of amine \n\nfunctionalized PhC18PMO aromatic rings is confirmed by the C-N stretching band displayed \n\nat 1267 cm-1 and the in plane N-H bending vibration (\u201cscissoring\u201d mode) near 1633 cm-1, \n\ntypical of an aromatic primary amine. This later band is overlapped with the band of  \n\nH\u2013O\u2013H bending vibrations. The band at 1633 cm-1 decreases intensity when the amine is \n\nalkylated, which corroborates the partial transformation of primary to secondary amine as \n\nsecondary amines do not show a band in this region. The N-H stretching modes of aromatic \n\nprimary amines appear at 3408 and 3367 cm-1. The aromatic C-H stretching bands appear in \n\nthe parent PhC18PMO at 3070 cm-1 and at ~3100 cm-1 in the NH2-PMO and N-alkylated \n\nmaterials. With the N-alkylation, the C-H stretching vibrations for saturated aliphatic species \n\noccur at 2980 cm-1. \n\nElemental analysis results are presented in Table C1.2 (Appendix C). NH2PhC18PMO has \n\nan amino group density close to 2 mmol\u00b7g-1 (3.2% of NH2), indicating that 47% of phenylene \n\nbridges were functionalized with the amine group. Using this technique it was confirmed \n\nthat about 87% of NH2PhC18PMO was converted into iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. The isopropyl \n\ngroup appears with a density close to 0.52 mmol\u00b7g-1. \n\nThe TGA curves (Figure C1.6, Appendix C) exhibit a first weight loss below 100 \u00b0C due to \n\ndesorption of physisorbed water. From 100 to 300 \u00b0C a 2% weight loss occurs in the case of \n\npure PhC18PMO due to the small quantity of non-extracted template. The parent PhC18PMO \n\nmaterial has a thermal stability up to 550 \u00b0C. Above this value the decomposition and release \n\nof the organic moieties from the framework takes place. The introduction of the amine group \n\nand the alkylation of the amine led to an expected decrease of the thermal stability. For \n\nexample, the iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 is only stable up to 350 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n5.1.4 Conclusion \n\nIt was demonstrated that well-ordered amine functionalized periodic mesoporous phenylene-\n\nsilica can be modified into the monoalkylated counterpart, by a simple microwave-assisted \n\nreaction, maintaining its structural integrity. This work proves that it is possible to extend \n\ntypical homogeneous phase reactions to hybrid material design with potential to open an \n\navenue toward new applications. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n169 \n\n \n\n5.2 Microwave-assisted N,N-dialkylation of amine-functionalized periodic \n\nmesoporous phenylene-silica \n\n \n\n \n\nAdapted from: \n\nMirtha A.

Gomes and Paula Ferreira \n\n \nMicrowave-assisted N,N-dialkylation of amine-functionalized periodic mesoporous \n\nphenylene-silica: An easy and fast way to design materials \n \n\nSubmitted for publication, 2016 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMy direct contribution: \n\nI declare that I have prepared and characterized all the PMO materials described in this  \n\nSub-chapter. This work was made in collaboration with Lu\u00eds Mafra, Mariana Sardo and  \n\nMaria Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, who were responsible for the 15N solid-state NMR experiments. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n170 \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Motivation \n\nAs demonstrated in Sub-chapter 5.1, microwave-assisted synthesis is a fast and simply way \n\nto modify the amine-phenylene-C18PMO with preservation of both meso- and molecular-\n\nscale periodicities. In the present Sub-chapter, it is used the microwave-assisted synthesis to \n\nmanipulate the amine-phenylene moieties in the NH2PhC18PMO as a versatile approach to \n\nintroduce new physical and chemical properties into PMOs. Novel functional groups may \n\nbe added to the PhC18PMOs by this methodology, which would be unreachable by \n\nconventional synthetic approaches. Hence, the N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with two \n\ndifferent alkyl agents is made in order to obtain N,N-dialkylated amine materials with \n\ndifferent features: i) the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO; and ii) the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO \n\nmaterials. The latter material is especially interesting since there is the possibility to convert \n\nthe CN moieties into other functional groups for creating novel PMOs with on-demand \n\nproperties to be considered mainly in catalysis and adsorption applications. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Experimental details \n\nPMO synthesis \n\nThe PhC18PMO[3,20] and the NH2PhC18PMO[7] were prepared according to the literature \n\nprocedures as described in Sub-chapter 5.1.2. \n\nThe microwave-assisted N,N-dialkylation on the NH2PhC18PMO was performed in a CEM \n\nDiscovery SP microwave. The reaction procedure starts with the addition of 1.107 g  \n\n(9.00 \u00d7 10-3 mol) of 2-bromopropane and 0.155 g (9.34 \u00d7 10-4 mol) of KI to a suspension of \n\n300 mg of NH2PhC18PMO in 3 mL of acetonitrile. The vial is then closed and heated at \n\n175 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was filtered, washed sequentially with CH2Cl2  \n\n(20 mL), NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution) and brine. Finally, the obtained powder was \n\ndried overnight at 60 \u00b0C. The material was exposed to a second reaction cycle in the same \n\nconditions, being denoted hereafter as (iPr)2NPhC18PMO. The same procedure was applied \n\nto the N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with 3-chloropropionitrile, using the same \n\nstoichiometry. The obtained material was denoted (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. \n\nThe (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO was prepared by gentle addition of 20 mL of HCl to  \n\n200 mg of (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. The reaction was stirred during 4 h at 45 \u00b0C. The \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n171 \n\n \n\nreaction mixture was washed with NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution), filtered-off and \n\nfurther washed with distilled water. The final powder was dried at 60 \u00b0C. \n\nAn additional sample, the iPrNHPhC18PMO, was prepared to demonstrate the possibility to \n\nobtain this material in a single cycle only. In this way, 6.82 \u00d7 10-3 mol of 2-bromopropane \n\nand 5.89 \u00d7 10-4 mol of KI were added to the previous NH2PhC18PMO and acetonitrile \n\nsuspension. The microwave-assisted reaction was performed at 165 \u00b0C during 20 min. The \n\nsame procedure previously described was used to wash and to dry the obtained material. \n\n \nMaterials characterization \n\nThe samples prepared were characterized by PXRD, -196 \u00b0C N2 adsorption-desorption \n\nisotherms, TGA, EA, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR, 13C CP-MAS NMR and  \n15N CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The experimental parameters used for each \n\ncharacterization technique are described in Chapter 2 and the data of -196 \u00b0C N2-sorption \n\nisotherms, 29Si NMR, FTIR, TGA and EA techniques are presented in Appendix C. \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Results and discussion \n\nN,N-dialkylated amine-PMOs can be obtained from NH2PhC18PMO by nucleophilic \n\naliphatic substitution of an alkyl halide under microwave irradiation. Figure 5.2.1 shows the \n\nsynthetic paths used in this work to prepare (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO \n\nand the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPMO materials. \n\nThe physical and textural features of the prepared PMOs were evaluated by PXRD,  \n\nN2-sorption isotherms and TEM. Figure 5.2.2 shows the PXRD patterns of the synthetized \n\nPhC18PMO materials. It is possible to observe in Figure 5.2.2 that the parent PhC18PMO \n\npresents a 2D hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice characterized by the presence of the \n\nstrong (100) reflection at low-angle range (with a d-spacing of 4.46 nm) followed by two \n\nless intense (110) and (200) reflections (Figure 5.2.2a). A medium range reflection at  \n\nd ? 0.76 nm is also detected which means that the PhC18PMO also has molecular-scale \n\nperiodicity as reported in the literature.[7] The post-functionalization of the phenylene \n\nmoieties of the PhC18PMO material leads to the preparation of functionalized PhC18PMOs \n\nwith (100) reflections that can be compatible with preservation of the 2D hexagonal \n\nsymmetry (p6mm) lattice, Figure 5.2.2. The NH2PhC18PMO is prepared by amination of the \n\nphenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO and presents a d-spacing of 4.41 nm (Figure 5.2.2b \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n172 \n\n \n\nand Table C2.1 Appendix C). The N,N-dialkylation with isopropyl group or with the \n\npropionitrile alkyl agent led to the preparation of the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO materials with d-spacings of 4.55 and 4.65 nm, respectively \n\n(Figure 5.2.2c-d and Table C2.1). \n\n \nFigure 5.2.2. Schematic representation of the preparation of N,N-dialkylated  \namine-C18PMOs by microwave-assisted reaction: i) amine functionalization of the phenylene \nmoieties of PMO; ii) dialkylation of the amine group with a) 2-bromopropane or  \nb) 3-chloropropionitrile; and iii) hydrolysis of nitrile group. \n \n\nThen, the hydrolysis of the nitrile group on the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO was carried out \n\nin order to synthetize the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to show the possibility of \n\nconverting the nitrile species into other functional groups. The mesopore-order of the latter \n\nmaterial is maintained after acid treatment and displays a d-spacing of 4.50 nm (Figure 5.2.2e \n\nand Table C2.1). Additionally, it is possible to observe in Figure 5.2.2 a reduction of intensity \n\nof the (100) reflection of the functionalized materials. This result may be associated to the \n\ninsertion of functional groups into the pores of the PhC18PMO, which causes a reduction of \n\nthe X-ray scattering contrast between the organosilica walls and the added functional \n\ngroups.[22] The prepared materials also show a reflection at d ~ 0.76, which indicates \n\nmolecular-scale periodicity typically observed in this type of PMOs and demonstrating that \n\nNH2\n\niib)\n\ni)\n\niii)\n\niia)\n\nN N\n\nN\n\nPhC18PMO\n\nNH2PhC18PMO\n\n(iPr)2NPhC18PMO (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO\n\n(HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n173 \n\n \n\nthe reaction conditions used on the N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO leave unaffected the \n\nperiodicity along the channel direction. \n\n \nFigure 5.2.2. X-ray diffraction patterns of a) PhC18PMO, b) NH2PhC18PMO, c) (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, \nd) (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO and e) (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. \n \n\nThe N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and the PSD curves of functionalized amine-\n\nPhC18PMO are depicted in Figure C2.1 (Appendix C). The synthetized PMOs exhibit a type \n\nIV isotherm, suggesting the presence of mesopores. The PSD curves confirm a narrow \n\ndistribution of the pore diameter. The N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with the \n\nisopropyl group leads to a reduction of the SBET, from 658 to 552 m2\u00b7g-1. The Vp and dp were \n\nfound to decrease from 0.65 to 0.56 cm3\u00b7g-1, and from 3.24 to 3.18 nm, respectively. These \n\nresults prove the insertion of the bulk functional groups into the pores (Figure 5.2.2a and \n\nTable C2.1, Appendix C). The use of 3-chloropropionitrile as alkyl halide agent gave also \n\nrise to the reduction of the SBET and Vp, corroborating the successful alkylation of the amine \n\nfunctionalities of the NH2PhC18PMO (Figure C2.1b and Table C2.1, Appendix C). The \n\nhydrolysis of the nitrile functional group in the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to obtain the \n\ncarboxylic acid functional group promotes again a decrease on the SBET, Vp and dp, as can be \n\nexplained by the much bulkier nature of this group relatively to that of nitrile (Figure C2.1b \n\nand Table C2.1). \n\nSolid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 5.2.3a) of the NH2PhC18PMO shows four \n\ntypical resonances at ca. 122, 124, 133 and 151 ppm, assigned to the sp2 aromatic carbons \n\nbonded to the amine group as reported in the literature.[7] The N,N-dialkylation reactions led \n\neither to slight changes in the chemical shifts or to the presence of additional resonances \n\n1 4 7 10 13\n\n2? (\u00b0)\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n174 \n\n \n\nwhen compared to the parent material. The N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with \n\nisopropyl groups yielded two additional peaks at ca. 21 and 44 ppm (Figure 5.2.3b), \n\nassociated to the CH3 and CH carbons, respectively, which is in good agreement with results \n\npreviously reported in Sub-chapter 5.1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.3. 13C CP-MAS of a) NH2PhC18PMO, b) (iPr)2NPhC18PMO,  \nc) (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO and d) (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. The 13C CP-MAS NMR \nspectra were acquired with a MAS rate of 12, 10, 7 and 10 kHz, respectively. The * denotes spinning \nsidebands. \n \n\nThe reaction of the NH2PhC18PMO using the 3-chloropropionitrile also promotes differences \n\nin the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum. Two resonances are observed at 17 and 21 ppm  \n\n(Figure 5.2.3c) corresponding to the NCCH2CH2- in slightly different chemical \n\nenvironments. The resonance associated to the CH2 covalently bonded to the aromatic amine \n\nappears at ca. 39 ppm. The CN quaternary carbon is not observed in the 13C CP-MAS NMR \n\nspectra, as it resonates in the same chemical shift range of the sp2 carbons associated to the \n\namine phenylene moieties. In order to prove the existence of the CN group in \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO, it was performed the hydrolysis of the nitrile group into COOH, \n\nwhich yields the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material. The resulting carboxylic acid \n\nshould be easily detected in the spectrum since it is expected to resonate at higher chemical \n\nshifts (c.f. > 170 ppm). This reaction brings differences to the spectrum (Figure 5.2.3d) as \n\nwell, i.e., the 13C resonances associated to the HOOC-CH2-, and to the -CH2-N- functions \n\nappear at ca. 23 and 39 ppm. The third peak associated to the presence of COOH groups is \n\nobserved at ca. 176 ppm. An additional resonance at ca. 172 ppm is only observed in the \n\n140160180\n\n?

Note that tertiary amines can remove stoichiometric \n\namounts of CO2 in the presence of moisture and may form bicarbonate ions as reported in \n\nthe literature.[23,24] \n\nThe 15N CP-MAS NMR (Figure 5.2.4) can be used to confirm if N-monoalkylation or \n\ncomplete/incomplete N,N-dialkylation occurred in NH2PhC18PMO. The spectrum of \n\nNH2PhC18PMO shown in Figure 5.2.4a exhibits a single peak at ca. -321 ppm, confirming \n\nthe presence of the primary amine group (NH2). In Figure 5.2.4b, the resonance observed at \n\nca. -292 ppm corresponds to the secondary amine (iPrNHPhC18PMO) obtained after  \n\nN-monoalkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with 2-bromopropane. This shift is in good \n\nagreement with the results showed in Sub-chapter 5.1. The dialkylated (iPr)2NPhC18PMO \n\nmaterial presents a single resonance at -244 ppm, that corresponds to the tertiary amine. This \n15N resonance is shifted ~50 ppm towards higher chemical shifts when compared to \n\nsecondary amines (c.f. Figures 5.2.4b and 5.2.4c) and indicates that the dialkylation reaction \n\nwas complete.  \n\n \nFigure 5.2.4. 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra of a) NH2PhC18PMO, b) iPrNHPhC18PMO,  \nc) (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, d) (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO_C1 and e) (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO.

Three resonances at -320, -270 and  \n\n-244 ppm are observed after the first reaction cycle, associated with primary amines (NH2), \n\nsecondary amines (NCCH2CH2-NH) and tertiary amines ((NCCH2CH2)2-N), respectively \n\n(Figure 5.2.4d). The second reaction cycle promotes a complete conversion of the primary \n\nand secondary amines into tertiary amines, which is corroborated by the presence of a single \n\nresonance at -244 ppm (Figure 5.2.4e). The resonance related to the nitrile group is not \n\nobserved in the 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra. This may happen due to the absence of proton, \n\nclose enough of this quaternary nitrogen, to promote the cross polarization during the \n\nacquisition of the spectrum. However, the presence of this specie in the material was proved \n\nin the 13C CP-MAS NMR, presented before, by observation of the resonance associated to \n\nthe carboxylic acid group whose formation occurs due to hydrolysis of the nitrile group.  \n\nThe 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure C2.2, Appendix C) of the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO, (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO show resonances at ca. -81,  \n\n-70 and -61 ppm corresponding to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous species  \n\n [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m], respectively. The applied strong microwave conditions promoted \n\nsome Si-C bond cleavages as concluded from the observed tiny peaks assigned to  \n\nQn [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] sites. \n\nThe N,N-dialkyaltion modification of the amine group in the NH2PhC18PMO was also \n\nfollowed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure C2.3, Appendix C). The NH2PhC18PMO shows the  \n\nC\u2013N stretching vibration displayed at 1298 cm-1 and the N\u2013H bending vibration \n\n(\u201cscissoring\u201d mode) near 1625 cm-1, confirming the presence of the aromatic primary amine \n\nin the framework of the PhC18PMO. The N\u2013H stretching modes of aromatic primary amines \n\nin the NH2PhC18PMO are observed at 3430-3367 cm-1. The C=C stretching modes of the \n\naromatic groups in the framework are observed at ca. 1600 cm-1. The N,N-dialkylation of \n\nthe amine groups promotes the disappearance of the band at 1625 cm-1, additionally, \n\ndifferent C=C stretching modes are observed between 1500 and 1680 cm-1 that are due to \n\nnon-aminated phenylene groups and N,N-dialkylated phenylene moieties in the PhC18PMO. \n\nThe aromatic C\u2013H stretching bands appear at 3050-3060 cm?1 in the NH2PhC18PMO and \n\nN,N-dialkylated materials. The N,N-dialkylation promotes the appearance of C\u2013H stretching \n\nvibrations bands at 2935-3000 cm?1 attributed to saturated aliphatic species of the  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n177 \n\n \n\nN,N-dialkylated PhC18PMO materials. The (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO presents a C\u2013O \n\nstretching peak at 1263 cm?1, a C=O stretching band at 1664 cm?1, and a O\u2013H stretching \n\nband at 2963 cm?1; all these bands are consistent with carboxylic acid formation from nitrile \n\ngroup. \n\nThe thermal stability of the N,N-dialkylated PMOs was assessed by TGA and the results are \n\nshown in Figure C2.4, Appendix C. The amine functionalized NH2PhC18PMO is stable up \n\nto 350 \u00b0C.[7] After N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO the thermal stability suffers a \n\nhuge decrease, independently of the alkyl halide agent. The (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and the \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO are stable up to ca. 180 \u00b0C as observed in Figure C2.4. The \n\nconversion of the CN group into the COOH functionality did not affect the thermal stability \n\nof the material. The first weight loss observed in the TGA of all materials is concomitant \n\nwith desorption of physisorbed water, which occurs below 100 \u00b0C. Then, the cleavage and \n\nrelease of the alkyl functional groups starts above 180 \u00b0C, which is followed by the cleavage \n\nand release of the amine group directly linked to the phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO at \n\nca. 350 \u00b0C. Finally, at about 500 \u00b0C, the decomposition and release of the phenylene bridges \n\nfrom the framework take place. \n\nTable C2.2 (Appendix C) displays the EA of the NH2PhC18PMO and N,N-dialkylated \n\nNH2PhC18PMO materials. NH2PhC18PMO displays an amino group density of  \n\n1.68 mmol\u00b7g-1, which corresponds to about 40% of phenylene moieties that suffered \n\namination. The N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with the isopropyl group leads to an \n\nincrease in the carbon (%C) and hydrogen (%H) percentages and to a decrease in the nitrogen \n\npercentage (%N), which is in agreement with the substitution of the hydrogens of the primary \n\namine by the isopropyl groups. The EA results indicate the conversion of 94% of primary \n\namine groups into tertiary amines. The (iPr)2NPhC18PMO material displays an isopropyl \n\ndensity close to 1.12 mmol\u00b7g-1. The (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO shows an increase in the C, \n\nH and N density as expected once the propionitrile groups are being introduced into the \n\nNH2PhC18PMO. This material presents a propionitrile density of 1.10 mmol\u00b7g-1, \n\ncorresponding to an amine conversion close to 92%. The hydrolysis of the CN group of the \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to prepare the (HOOCCH2CH2)2-N-PMO material is also \n\nconfirmed by the EA technique, by reduction of the %N. The %C and %H also suffer a \n\nreduction, associated to the introduction of oxygen atoms into the material. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n178 \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Conclusions \n\nThe N,N-dialkyaltion of NH2PhC18PMO was explored for the first time using a  \n\nmicrowave-assisted modification synthesis. (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and the \n\n(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO materials were achieved and fully characterized, indicating the  \n\ndi-alkylation of the aromatic amino groups of the PMOs, while maintaining integrity of the \n\nmeso and molecular orders of the starting materials. \n\nThe nitrile group of the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material can be further modified. \n\nTherefore, this work provides indication of the potential of the microwave-assisted post-\n\nsynthesis modification of the organic bridges of PhC18PMO to introduce alternative \n\nfunctional groups. Hence, on-demand PMOs may be developed for a wide range of \n\napplications. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n179 \n\n \n\n5.3 Microwave-assisted amination of the phenylene-PMO \n\n \n\n \n\nAdapted from: \n\nMirtha A.

In order to make these materials (e.g. NH2PhC18PMO) more \n\ncompetitive, it would be important to reduce their synthesis time. This functionalization \n\nreaction consists first of a strong acid treatment to introduce the nitro group in the phenyl \n\nring, which is followed by its reduction to the amine.[7] \n\nThe effect of the temperature and time of reaction together with the microwave radiation on \n\nthe quantity of nitro groups incorporated in the phenyl bridge of the PMO and their reduction \n\nto amines is an important aspect since it would make the synthesis of these materials faster \n\nand, consequently, PMOs would become more attractive for the several foreseen \n\napplications.  \n\nIn this Sub-chapter, it is presented a systematic optimization study of the nitration of \n\nPhC18PMO at four different temperatures and different reaction times using microwave \n\nheating treatment. The effects of microwave radiation, synthesis temperature and time on \n\nthe chemical and structural stability of NO2PhC18PMOs were evaluated and correlated with \n\nthe amount of nitro groups introduced in the phenylene moieties. The reduction reaction of \n\nthe nitro group to the amine group was also made at four different temperatures during 15 \n\nminutes. \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Experimental details \n\nPMO synthesis \n\nThe phenylene PMO (PhC18PMO) was synthesized according to the procedure described in \n\nSub-chapter 4.1. The surfactant template was extracted using an ethanol/HCl solution. The \n\nnitro functional groups were incorporated into the phenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO by \n\ntreatment with a strong acid solution of HNO3\u2013H2SO4 using a procedure from the literature[7] \n\nwith subtle modifications. The NO2PhC18PMO was obtained by dropping a solution of \n\nHNO3 (0.7 mL) and H2SO4 (2.2 mL) into PhC18PMO (250 mg). Vials (10 mL) containing \n\nthe previous mixtures were then sealed and heated at 37, 60, 75 and 90 \u00b0C for 15, 120 and \n\n360 min in a CEM Discovery SP-D microwave apparatus, operating at a frequency of 2.45 \n\nGHz with continuous radiation power from 0 to 300W. By the end, the reaction mixtures \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n181 \n\n \n\nwere transferred into cold distilled water (150 mL) and were then filtered and successively \n\nwashed with large amounts of water. All samples were dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C. The samples \n\nobtained in this first step of the work are named \u201cNO2PhC18PMO_y/T\u201d, where y is the \n\nheating time expressed in minutes (min) and T is the heating temperature expressed in degree \n\nCelsius (\u00b0C). The reduction of the nitro to the amine group was accomplished by treatment \n\nof the different NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C with HCl/SnCl2 solution.[7] The \n\nNH2PhC18PMO was obtained by drop wise of a solution of HCl (3.13 mL) and SnCl2  \n\n(0.33 g) to the NO2PhC18PMO (100 mg). Vials (10 mL) having the above mixtures were \n\nthen closed and heated at 37, 60, 75 and 90 \u00b0C during 15 min in a CEM Discovery SP-D \n\nmicrowave apparatus. The reaction mixtures were poured into distilled water (100 mL) and \n\nwere then filtered, washed with large amounts of water and followed by washing with a \n\nsolution of isopropylamine (2.5 mL) in ethanol (25 mL). All samples were dried overnight \n\nat 60 \u00b0C. The different samples are denoted \u201cNH2PhC18PMO_15min/T\u201d, where T is the \n\nheating temperature expressed in \u00b0C. \n\nThe conventional syntheses to obtain the NO2PhC18PMO were performed according to  \n\nRef. [7], at room temperature during 72 h. The syntheses required additional 72 h to attain the \n\nNH2PhC18PMO (total time was 8640 min). The two samples resulting from the conventional \n\nsynthetic procedure are named NO2PhC18PMO_C and NH2PhC18PMO_C, respectively.  \n\nIn order to further check the microwave effect on the nitration of the phenylene bridge of the \n\nPhC18PMO, a conventional reaction was performed during 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. The material \n\nwas denoted NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37\u00b0C_C. \n\n \nMaterials characterization \n\nThe samples prepared in this study were characterized by PXRD, TEM, SEM, -196 \u00b0C \n\nnitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, TGA, EA, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR \n\nand 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The experimental parameters used for each \n\ntechnique in this study are described in Chapter 2 and some data of 13C CP-MAS NMR,  \n29Si NMR, FTIR, PXRD, -196 \u00b0C N2-sorption isotherms, TGA, SEM techniques are \n\npresented in Appendix C. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n182 \n\n \n\n5.3.3 Results and Discussion \n\nThe nitration of phenylene bridges in PhC18PMO and the subsequent nitro reduction to the \n\namine groups under microwave irradiation were successfully accomplished after reaction \n\nduring a total time of only 30 min at 60 \u00b0C as confirmed by 13C CP-MAS NMR  \n\n(Figures 5.3.1 and C3.1, Appendix C) and FTIR (Figures 5.3.2, 5.3.6, C3.2 and C3.3) \n\nspectroscopies. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the parent PhC18PMO displays one peak \n\nat 133.5 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons from the phenylene bridge.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.3.1. 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PhC18PMO, NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C and \nNH2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C. \n\n \n\nThe nitration reaction changes the chemical environment of the carbons of the phenylene \n\ngroup. In this way, the NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C presents four peaks at ca. 151, 137, 133 \n\nand 129 ppm. The reduction of the nitro group to the amine group is also accompanied by \n\nchanges in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum. Thus, the NH2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C \n\nexhibits five resonance peaks at 150, 133, 124, 122 and 119 ppm that are assignable to the \n\ncarbons in the phenylene moieties with amine groups linked. Thus, when compared with the \n\nconventional synthesis, microwave heating opens an avenue for faster functionalization of \n\nthe phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO materials with nitro or amine groups. Using the \n\nmicrowave procedure, with only 15 min of reaction for each step at 60 \u00b0C, it was possible to \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n183 \n\n \n\nachieve the same degree of amine functionalization as that obtained after six days of the \n\nconventional synthesis, c.f. Table 5.3.1. \n\nThe NO2PhC18PMO_y/T materials were also characterized by FTIR spectroscopy to \n\ncorroborate the nitro functionalization of PhC18PMO, Figures 5.3.2 and C3.2. The \n\nPhC18PMO presents overtones of phenyl vibrations between 1300-2000 cm-1, absorption \n\nmodes assigned to the silanol stretching bands at 3200-3800 cm-1 and C-H aromatic \n\nstretching bands at 3028 and 3066 cm-1. These values are similar to those described \n\npreviously for PhC18PMO.[7] \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.2. FTIR (ATR) spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_y/T at a) 37 \u00b0C and b) 60 \u00b0C for two different \nreaction times and c) NO2PhC18PMO_15min/T at different temperatures. The region of 1250 \u2013 1700 \ncm-1 was chosen to better observe the main bands of functionalization. Black curves are for the parent \nPhC18PMO material. \n \n\nSome changes in the FTIR spectra of PhC18PMO appear after the nitration reaction. The \n\npresence of nitro groups in the aromatic rings of the PhC18PMO is confirmed by the C-N \n\nstretching mode displayed at 1267 cm-1, and by the appearance of strong bands due to N-O \n\nsymmetrical and asymmetrical stretchings at 1352 and 1541 cm-1, respectively. These two \n\nNO stretching bands are more intense in the case of nitrated PMOs with time reaction of  \n\n360 min than in the materials functionalized during 15 min. It is seen that the spectrum for \n\nNO2 PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C, presents NO stretching bands with similar intensities to that \n\nof the NO2PhC18PMO_360min/37\u00b0C material, c.f. Figures 5.3.2a and 5.3.2b. The nitrated \n\nPhC18PMO with NO stretching bands with the highest intensities corresponds to that \n\nobtained with the largest reaction time and temperature, i.e., 360 min and 60 \u00b0C.  \n\nFigure 5.3.2c displays the FTIR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_15min/T materials in which it is \n\npossible to observe the increase of intensity of the two NO stretching bands with increasing \n\ntemperature. Consequently, the increase of the number of nitrated phenylene moieties is \n\n1250 1450 1650\n\nA\nb\n\ns\no\n\nrb\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n15min\n\n360mina)\n\n1250 1450 1650\n\nA\nb\n\ns\no\n\nrb\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n360min\n\n15min\n\nb)\n\n1250 1450 1650\nA\n\nb\ns\no\n\nrb\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n37\u00b0C\n\n60\u00b0C\n\n75\u00b0C\n\n90\u00b0Cc)\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n184 \n\n \n\ndirectly correlated with the increase of temperature and in turn it can be correlated with the \n\ninjection of microwave irradiation power. The microwave radiation effect is observed \n\nthrough the comparison of the FTIR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37\u00b0C and the NO2 \n\nPhC18PMO_15min/37\u00b0C_C, Figure C3.2d. The material prepared under microwave-assisted \n\nheating presents much intense NO stretching bands than the material prepared using \n\nconventional heating at the same temperature, which corroborates the favorable effect of the \n\nmicrowave irradiation on speeding up the nitration of the bissilylated phenylene bridge of \n\nthe PhC18PMO. \n\nTable 5.3.1 shows the results of the elemental analyses for the PhC18PMO parent material \n\nand for the materials aminated under different reaction conditions. \n\n \nTable 5.3.1.

Assuming an incorporation of just one amine group per \n\nphenylene bridge, this density value indicates that ~42% of phenylene bridges were \n\nsuccessfully functionalized. Under microwave irradiation at 37 \u00b0C, such a high value of \n\nfunctionalization (maximum was 1.16 mmol\u00b7g-1) could not be reached. It is also concluded \n\nthat the irradiation time strongly influences the nitration reaction at 37 \u00b0C since an increase \n\nin the density of amine groups from 1.16 to 1.59 mmol\u00b7g-1 is obtained with the increase of \n\nthe nitration reaction from 15 to 120 min, respectively. The increase in the density of amine \n\ngroups obtained upon incrementing the time of reaction from 120 to 360 min is less evident, \n\ni.e., a slight increase of 0.20 mmol\u00b7g-1 is found in the latter. When the synthesis is carried \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n185 \n\n \n\nout at 60 \u00b0C, the density of amine groups in the PhC18PMO after 15 min of reaction reaches \n\na value of 1.76 mmol\u00b7g-1, which is similar to the density in the sample obtained by \n\nconventional synthesis. This demonstrates that the reaction is extremely dependent on the \n\ntemperature and heating source. Note that the microwave injected 230 W of power to achieve \n\n60 \u00b0C, which is 140 W higher than the value required to reach 37 \u00b0C. The higher amount of \n\namine groups introduced into the phenylene moieties may be due to the faster diffusion of \n\nthe amine contents into the PhC18PMO at 60 \u00b0C. The increase of amine groups in the \n\nphenylene moieties takes place when the time is raised from 15 to 120 min with a difference \n\nof 0.26 mmol\u00b7g-1, corresponding to a percentage of phenylene bridges nitrated close to 6%. \n\nThe difference is even lower when the time is extended to 360 min, with a density of amine \n\ngroups of approximately 2.11 mmol\u00b7g-1, i.e., an increase of only 0.09 mmol\u00b7g-1 when \n\ncompared to the NO2PhC18PMO_120min/60\u00b0C material (Table 5.3.1). The use of \n\nmicrowave power to reach 60 \u00b0C leads to a higher nitro content than the use of conventional \n\nheating to reach the same temperature. This was observed for the synthesis of the material \n\nNO2PhC18PMO_C_4320min/60\u00b0C (conventional synthesis during 3 days made at 60 \u00b0C) \n\nwhich has similar amount of nitro groups than the material NO2PhC18PMO_240min/60\u00b0C. \n\nMoreover, the NO2PhC18PMO_C_4320m/60\u00b0C material loose the meso-scale periodicity \n\n(not shown) which is a huge disadvantaged comparing with the similar material made by \n\nusing microwave heating. \n\nTable 5.3.1 also reveals the amount of nitro groups incorporated in the phenylene moieties \n\nof the PhC18PMO material with the increase of the temperature for similar reaction time  \n\n(15 min). The consideration of high temperature is found to promote the introduction of \n\nhigher amounts of nitro groups into the PhC18PMO channels. Since \n\nNH2PhC18PMO_15min/75\u00b0C presents a nitrogen density of 2.11 mmol\u00b7g-1 which is similar \n\nto that for NH2PhC18PMO_360min/60\u00b0C, it suggests that the temperature is very important \n\nto control the nitrogen density into the PhC18PMO for short times of reaction. By increasing \n\nthe temperature reaction to 90 \u00b0C resulted in a PhC18PMO material having the highest \n\ncontent of nitro groups linked to the phenylene bridge of the PhC18PMO. The nitrogen \n\ndensity of 2.26 mmol\u00b7g-1 determined for NH2PhC18PMO_15min/90\u00b0C corresponds to a total \n\nof nitrated phenylene moieties of more than 50%. \n\nThe 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of PhC18PMO, NO2-PMO_15min/37\u00b0C and \n\nNO2PhC18PMO_360min/60\u00b0C are shown in Figure 5.3.3. The pure PhC18PMO exhibits \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n186 \n\n \n\npeaks at ca. 81, 71.5 and 61.5 ppm, which correspond to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous \n\nspecies, respectively. As expected taking into account the literature, significant changes are \n\nintroduced in the 29Si NMR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_y/T materials upon the nitration \n\nreaction.[7] Peaks related with the presence of Qn species are absent in the 29Si spectra for all \n\nmaterials, which is a strong evidence that carbon-silicon bond cleavage is not happening \n\nduring the nitration reaction under microwave conditions. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.3.3. 29Si MAS (left) and CP-MAS NMR (right) spectra of PhC18PMO (bottom) and \nNO2PhC18PMOs_y/T (top) obtained at two different reaction times and temperatures. \n \n\nPXRD was used to evaluate the structural order of all materials. Figure 5.3.4 shows the \n\nPXRD patterns of the PhC18PMO and NO2PhC18PMO_y/T obtained at different reaction \n\nconditions (temperature and time). All prepared materials displayed an intense low angle \n\nreflection and two much less intense peaks all corresponding, respectively, to the (100), \n\n(110) and (200) reflections characteristic of the two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry \n\n(p6mm) lattice. The PhC18PMO and the two most extreme NO2PhC18PMO samples, i.e., \n\nNO2PhC18PMOs synthesized during 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C or during 360 min at 60 \u00b0C, exhibit \n\nthe first strong characteristic low angle (100) reflections at d = 4.55 nm, 4.70 nm and 4.55 \n\nnm, respectively. From the spacing (d) of the (100) peak it can be calculated the hexagonal \n\nunit cell lattice parameter, a, which is equal to 2d100/?3 (Table C3.1). For the samples \n\nPhC18PMO, NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37\u00b0C and NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C, the first sharp \n\ndiffraction at medium-range reflection can be detected at d = 0.761, 0.762  and 0.758 nm, \n\nrespectively, which is attributed to the periodic arrangement of the organic bridge within the \n\npore walls of these materials.

Attempts were made for fast synthesis \n\n(15 min) of materials with more than 50% of phenylene moieties mono-nitrated into the \n\nPhC18PMO channels by increasing the temperature of the nitration reaction to 75 and 90 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.4.

The 2D \n\nhexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice is attained for all the materials as supported by the \n\nobservation of the first strong peak corresponding to the (100) reflection and two less intense \n\npeaks corresponding to the (110) and (200) reflections.

TEM micrographs of NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C. The inset displays a micrograph \nperpendicular to the pores where it is clear their 2D hexagonal arrangement. \n \n\nThe -196 \u00b0C N2 sorption isotherms and PSD curves (Figure C3.5) confirm the characteristic \n\ntype IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) and narrow distribution of pore sizes for the pure \n\nPhC18PMO and NO2 PhC18PMO_y/T materials commonly seen in mesoporous materials.[3] \n\nA decrease of the SBET and Vp upon increase of the temperature and reaction times is \n\nconsistent with the enhancement of the degree of functionalization with nitro groups. The \n\nSBET of the materials synthetized at 37 \u00b0C decreases with the increase of the reaction time. \n\nThe increase in the reaction temperature from 37 to 60 \u00b0C is also accompanied by a decrease \n\nof the SBET. The N2 sorption isotherms display the increase of the SBET with the increase of \n\nthe reaction time for the nitrated materials prepared at 60 \u00b0C (Table C3.1), which is the \n\nopposite of what is expected. This can be attributed to the splitting of the large aggregates \n\ninto small particles due to the microwave irradiation as observed before by Smeulders  \n\net al.[8] in the microwave-assisted synthesis of PhC18PMO under long reaction times. \n\nFigure C3.6 shows the TGA curves for PhC18PMO and NO2PhC18PMO at 37 and 60 \u00b0C for \n\ntwo different time extremes. The first weight loss for all materials corresponds to desorption \n\nof physisorbed water occurring below 100 \u00b0C. The PhC18PMO material presents a thermal \n\nstability up to 550 \u00b0C. Above this temperature, all materials suffer decomposition due to the \n\ndegradation of the phenylene bridges from the framework. The nitro group introduction in \n\nthe phenylene moieties decreases the thermal stability of all materials and a new weight loss, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n189 \n\n \n\ncorresponding to the cleavage of nitro group in the phenylene bridge of the material, is \n\nobserved at approximately 400 \u00b0C. \n\nSEM images for NO2PhC18PMO materials obtained using different synthetic conditions are \n\nshown in Figure C3.7. The SEM images reveal the high order along the channels for all \n\nmaterials. The particle size of the different materials as a function of the reaction conditions \n\ncould not be determined due to formation of ordered aggregates. \n\nThe reduction of the nitro groups is a very important step for obtaining the aminated \n\ncompounds and the decrease of the reaction time will have obvious implications for the \n\nconsideration of these materials in catalysis and adsorption applications. \n\nThe nitro to amine reduction was followed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, Figure 5.3.6. Upon \n\ntreatment with SnCl2\u2013HCl, the N\u2013O stretching vibrations disappeared completely in the case \n\nof reaction at 60 \u00b0C while new bands attributable to the bending and stretching modes of  \n\nN\u2013H appeared at 1633 and 3340\u20133487 cm-1, respectively. It was also possible to observe the \n\nimportance of the microwave heating in this reaction.  \n\n \nFigure 5.3.6.

The molecular periodicity is \n\npreserved with the increase of the reaction temperature. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.7. a) X-ray diffraction patterns for PhC18PMO, NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C and \nNH2PhC18PMO_15m/T and b) TEM images of NH2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C. \n \n\nThe TEM images observed in Figure 5.3.7b support the preservation of the order along the \n\nchannels and also the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the pores of the \n\nNH2PhC18PMO_15min/60\u00b0C material. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n191 \n\n \n\nThe PhC18PMO and the NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T synthesized at 37, 60, 75 and 90 \u00b0C exhibit \n\nthe first strong characteristic low angle (100) reflection at d = 4.55, 4.37, 4.41, 4.37 and 4.46 \n\nnm, respectively, Table C3.2. \n\nThe -196 \u00b0C N2 sorption isotherms shown in Figure C3.9 confirm the type IV isotherms for \n\nthe synthetized NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T materials and PSD curves confirms the narrow \n\ndistribution of pore sizes. \n\nThe thermal stability of the amine PhC18PMO is similar to that of the PhC18PMO nitrated, \n\nFigure C3.10. The cleavage of the amine group in the phenylene bridge of the aminated \n\nmaterial, is observed at approximately 400 \u00b0C. The thermal stability of the NH2PhC18PMO \n\nis not affected by the use of different reaction temperatures using the microwave heating. \n\nThe thermal stability is similar to that of the aminated PhC18PMO material prepared \n\nconventionally.[7] \n\n \n\n5.3.4 Conclusions \n\nThis study shows that the time and the temperature of reaction are essential factors in the \n\nnitration of phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO materials and subsequent reduction of the \n\nnitro groups to amines. The information gathered from different experimental techniques, \n\nnamely elemental analysis, TGA, and 13C CP-MAS NMR, 29Si CP-MAS NMR and FTIR \n\nspectroscopies, shows that changing the time and temperature of the nitration reaction under \n\nmicrowave irradiation has a huge influence on the amount of nitro groups incorporated into \n\nthe PhC18PMO without cleavage of the Si-C bond. Both meso- and molecular-scale \n\nperiodicities are preserved after strong acid treatment under microwave heating (observed \n\nby PXRD patterns and TEM images).  \n\nThe temperatures used in the microwave heating (37 and 60 \u00b0C) are accompanied by \n\ndifferent behaviors of the kinetic profiles. It was possible to find a clear dependence of the \n\namount of nitro groups incorporated into the PhC18PMOs with the reaction time (up to 120 \n\nmin) for reactions carried out at 37 \u00b0C comparing with reactions made at 60 \u00b0C. SEM does \n\nnot show differences on the particles of parent and functionalized materials. A significant \n\nreduction in the time required for the nitration of phenylene bridges in PhC18PMO was \n\nobserved upon microwave irradiation. Characterization with several different techniques \n\nsuggests that nitration occurs without modification of the structural properties of the parent \n\nPhC18PMO. Importantly, in some cases, e.g. microwave-assisted reaction at T = 60 \u00b0C and \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n192 \n\n \n\ny = 120 min, the nitro groups content incorporated into the PhC18PMO channels was larger \n\nthan that achieved under conventional conditions (3 days at room temperature), while similar \n\ncontents between microwave-assisted and conventional heating were found when the \n\nsynthesis used microwave irradiation during 15 min at 75 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the nitration \n\nreaction carried out at 90 \u00b0C during 15 min resulted in a content of nitrated phenylene \n\nmoieties above 50%. \n\nThe microwave synthesis method presents clear advantages when compared with the \n\nconventional synthesis approaches, both in time and in the amount of nitro groups \n\nincorporated in the phenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO material. The use of the microwave \n\nheating promotes a high control of the nitro groups incorporated into the phenylene moieties \n\nof the PhC18PMO material. Additionally, the reduction of the nitro to the amine groups was \n\nalso successfully achieved after treatment with SnCl2/HCl under microwave irradiation with \n\npreservation of the structural order. \n\nThe use of microwave heating speeds up the nitration of the phenylene-C18PMO probably \n\ndue to the presence of polar intermediate species, such as nitronium ion and water molecules. \n\nMoreover the transition state of the material should be more reactive under microwave \n\nirradiation when compared to thermal heating due to the specific microwave absorption by \n\nthe polar reactants. In addition, it is believed that the diffusion of the reactant species through \n\nthe mesochannels of the phenylene-C18PMO is improved using the microwave irradiation, \n\nallowing a fast access of the nitronium ion to the phenylene bridges for the nucleophilic \n\nattack, which is a determinant rate step. \n\nAlthough phenylene-C18PMO is considered an apolar substance, i.e. being a weaker \n\nmicrowave irradiation absorber, it must be considered that the silanols and the delocalization \n\nof the electrons by the approximation of the positive nitronium ion can play a beneficial role \n\nin the local heating. In the amination step, the nitro groups attached to the phenylene bridges \n\nare also important for the generation of local heating which will speed-up the reaction. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n193 \n\n \n\n5.4 Bibliography \n\n1 M.

It is proposed a list of possible research lines that may be \n\nfollowed in the future aiming the improvement of the properties of PMO materials, not \n\nonly in adsorption and separation applications, but also in catalysis.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n196 \n\n \n\n6.1. General Conclusions \n\nIn this PhD Thesis, the synthesis and modification of several PMO materials were \n\nsuccessfully accomplished using different synthetic approaches. Figure 6.1 summarizes the \n\nwork performed over the last 4 years and presents the main conclusions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Preparation of novel PMOs using different synthetic strategies and their main physical \n\nor chemical characteristics for the CO2 and CH4 separation. \n \n\nThe materials were fully characterized; they showed two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry \n\n(p6mm) lattice and molecular-scale periodicities as observed by PXRD and TEM. Most of \n\nthe prepared materials were tested in the CO2 and CH4 adsorption/separation at 35 or 25 \u00b0C \n\n(Chapters 3 and 4). All tested materials are selective for CO2, i.e., they are able to adsorb \n\nmuch larger amounts of CO2 than of CH4 and, therefore, they can be considered as \n\npromising candidates for the separation of mixtures of these two gases. In fact, the amount \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n197 \n\n \n\nof adsorbed methane in all the materials tested was found to be very low. Additionally, \n\nDFT modelling was performed for the materials presenting mainly amino groups in order \n\nto understand how the surfaces of the pristine and modified materials interact with the CO2 \n\nand CH4 molecules (Chapter 3). In the case of the synthetized amine-modified phenylene \n\nPMOs having different pore sizes, a direct correlation between the amounts of CO2 \n\nadsorbed and the pore sizes or the specific surface areas of the PMO materials was not \n\nfound. However, the differences in the adsorbed quantities of CO2 could be related with the \n\npercentage of T2SMP silanol species, providing a good prediction of the experimental \n\nHenry\u2019s law constants for pure CO2 adsorption on each material (Sub-chapter 3.1). Thus, \n\nthe best adsorbent properties are correlated with the largest degrees of silica condensation. \n\nThe amination of the phenylene moieties of the PhCnPMO was more effective on materials \n\ndisplaying smaller pore size, which was accompanied by the concomitant increase of the \n\nKH for the CO2.  \n\nThe grafting of the alkyl amines to the materials with smaller pore size to offer \n\nAPTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO adsorbents improved the adsorption \n\nof CO2 without increasing the adsorption of CH4 (Sub-chapter 3.2). It was observed that \n\nthe introduction of amines into the PhC12PMO material is in general accompanied by an \n\nincrease of the quantity of adsorbed CO2 over the studied pressure range. The Henry\u2019s \n\nconstants for CO2 adsorption were significantly increased, growing in the order PhC12PMO \n\n&lt;NH2PhC12PMO &lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO &lt;APTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the \n\nAPTMS@PhC12PMO material has more affinity for CO2 than any other amine-modified \n\nPMO material (with a KH for CO2 of 1.83 \u00d7 10\n-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1). The results suggested \n\nthat the type of amine presents a dominant effect on the CO2 sorption affinity, more than \n\nthe nitrogen content in the PMO channels, demonstrating that alkyl amines interact more \n\nfavorably with CO2 than aromatic amines. Periodic DFT calculations confirmed the \n\nbehavior observed for the amino-functionalized PhPMO presented above on the CO2 and \n\nCH4 adsorption. Furthermore, the strengths of the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions were \n\nfound to correlate well with the Henry\u2019s constants from the experimental adsorption \n\nstudies. \n\nThe Al-PhC18PMO#50 material (Chapter 4) showed acidic Al\nV aluminium oxide species \n\nthat are probably responsible for the observed increase in the CO2/CH4 separation \n\nselectivity. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n198 \n\n \n\nThe pyrolysis of phenylene- and biphenylene- PMO families resulted in carbonized PMO \n\nmaterials with differences in both the chemistry and the textural properties of the materials \n\n(Chapter 4). The reduction of pore size to micro-pores was the most significant difference \n\nobserved when compared with the starting materials, leading to an improvement of the \n\nCO2 adsorption capacity and the selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation. The highest selectivity \n\non the CO2/CH4 separation was observed for materials with the highest microporosity. The \n\nmost interesting material for CO2/CH4 separation is the biphenylene-PMO pyrolysed at \n\n1200 \u00b0C, presenting the highest KH for the CO2 (2.34 \u00d7 10\n-2 mmol\u00b7g-1\u00b7kPa-1) observed in \n\nthis PhD study (Chapters 3 and 4), which is remarkable for a material without further \n\namine functionalization and showing that the relation between micro- and meso-porosity \n\nplays an important role in the adsorption of CO2 and CH4. \n\nTable 6.1 presents a comparison of the materials prepared in this PhD Thesis and tested in \n\nthe CO2 and CH4 adsorption. \n\n \nTable 6.1.

The presence of a good relation \n\nbetween micro- and meso- porosity improves the adsorption of CO2, while the presence of \n\nalkyl amines allows a reduction of the CH4 adsorption. Thus, the preparation of an alkyl \n\namine grafted BphC12PMO material could be remarkable in the CO2/CH4 \n\nadsorption/separation, through creation of microporosity originated by the introduction of a \n\nsignificant amount of alkyl amines. The preparation of these material it was not yet \n\npossible due to difficulties found in the preparation of BphC12PMO material with highly \n\nordered pores. \n\nIn order to make the PMO materials more interesting for adsorption or even catalytic \n\napplications, the microwave-assisted synthesis was utilized to introduce different kinds of \n\namine groups into the PMOs in a fast and easy way (Chapter 5). Using this type of heating \n\nit was possible the modification of the amine moieties of the NH2PhC18PMO with different \n\nalkyl groups (iPr- and NCCH2CH2- groups), through N-monoalkylation or  \n\nN,N-dialkylation, without destroying the structural integrity of the parent PMO  \n\n(Sub-chapters 5.1 and 5.2) and to prepare NH2PhCnPMOs in 30 min. of microwave heating \n\nin a two-step amination process (Sub-chapter 5.3). Furthermore, it was proved that the \n\nnitrile group of the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material remains intact on the surface of \n\nthe materials, which may enable additional functionalization, as for instance, by chemical \n\nmodification into carboxylic acids, amines or even transformation into amino acids. \n\nTherefore, this work provides indication of the potential of the microwave-assisted post-\n\nsynthesis modification of the organic bridges of PhC18PMO to introduce alternative \n\nfunctional groups. Hence, on-demand PMOs may be developed for a wide range of \n\napplications. \n\n \n\n6.2. Recommendations for further research \n\nIn terms of future work, it is suggested the improvement of the PMO features for the CO2 \n\nand CH4 adsorption. In fact, from this PhD Thesis it becomes clear that the preparation of \n\nadsorbents for biogas upgrading needs to have into account several different factors, such \n\nas, functional group loading, surface area, pore volume and pore size, distances between \n\nfunctional groups and distances between functional groups and silanols. \n\nIn this way, it is proposed to modify the PMO features in order to: \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n200 \n\n \n\ni) reduce even more the pore size of the aromatic-bridge PMOs (PhCnPMO and \n\nBphCnPMO with n &lt;12); \n\nii) create microporosity in the PMO using bissilylated precursor with different alkyl \n\namines by grafting reaction; \n\niii) prepare PMOs with amine functional groups introduced in favorable positions to \n\nconnect with CO2 molecules, i.e., place functional groups at an adequate distance \n\nfrom each other  for enhancing the chemical characteristics for CO2 adsorption. \n\nThus, the preparation of PMOs materials with amino acids (tyrosine, histidine, \n\nalanine, arginine, etc.), amino alcohols or pyridine and indole compounds bonded to \n\nthe amines of the NH2PhCnPMOs is proposed, as well as, the evaluation of the \n\nresulting materials in the adsorption of CO2 and CH4; \n\niv) impregnate a fine layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the pores of PMO, in order \n\nto incorporate significant amounts of alkylamines and to generate microporosity into \n\nthe PMO without clogging the pores; \n\nv) prepare selective nanocomposite-PMOs using the ALD technique. To accomplish \n\nsuch goal the study of surface dependency in the aluminium oxide deposition must \n\nbe made (i.e. deposition of aluminium oxide into BphCnPMO, SBA-15, MCM-41, \n\netc). Additionally, the creation of defects in the aluminium oxide layer can improve \n\nthe CO2 adsorption; such creation of defects can be done by chemical attack of the \n\nAl-PhC18PMO#50 composite. Alternatively, a different metal oxide can be inserted \n\ninto the PMO materials; \n\nvi) introduce nitrogen functional groups which are not easily labile in pyrolysis process \n\n(by preparation of pyridine- or bipyridine- PMOs or even by post-synthetic \n\nfunctionalization of PMO with N2 or NH3 cold plasma treatment);  \n\nvii) create biocomposites-PMOs with introduction of a fine layer of chitosan or chitosan \n\nand melanine into the PMO materials and to proceed to the pyrolysis of the resulting \n\nmaterials. This can be an interesting approach since it has been demonstrated that the \n\npyrolysed chitosan presents interesting CO2 adsorption properties. Also, this polymer \n\nis a cheap raw material that can be used to insert amine groups and to create \n\nmicroporosity into the PMOs. These chitosan-PMO composites may display \n\nelectrical conductive features and can be also good candidates for the \n\nelectroreduction of CO2.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n201 \n\n \n\nIn parallel with this, it is also important to continue the computer simulation using the \n\nsame approach considered in this PhD Thesis, for screening other phenylene-PMO \n\nfunctionalizations or of other organic bridged PMOs, with the desired characteristics for \n\nCO2/CH4 separation. Additionally, as the computational cost is an important factor for \n\nscreening purposes, small but appropriate cluster models centered on the organic or \n\ninorganic moieties are thought to study the surface of PMO materials with large organic \n\nbridges and their interactions with CO2 and CH4. State-of-the-art DFT functionals need to \n\nbe tested as well as the cluster size, stoichiometry and shape of the PMO cluster model. \n\nAs referred in Chapter 1, several PMO materials present intrinsic structural features for \n\ncatalytic applications (Kn\u00f6venagel condensation, kinetic resolution of hydrobenzoin or of \n\n1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol, etc.), and adsorption of metal ions (Hg(II), Cu(II), etc.) or \n\norganic compounds (naproxen, etc.) when compared with other kinds of materials (silicas, \n\nMOFs and zeolites). It will be interesting to test the prepared PMOs in these applications.  \n\nAs it is understood from this PhD Thesis, the preparation of different kinds of PMO \n\nmaterials, using different functionalization strategies, to change their physical, chemical \n\nand textural properties is an important way to find new remarkable materials for a wide \n\nrange of applications. In this way, the search for new strategies targeting the synthesis \n\nand/or the modification of novel PMOs is a step to be explored in the future for obtaining \n\nmaterials with enhanced adsorptive properties. \n\n\n\n \n\n202 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendices \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendices \n\n204 \n\n \n\nAppendix A \n\n \n\n \n\nA1.1.

E290A794) while the remaining are normally closed (ref. \n\nE290A791). \n\nValves 1 and 3 enable the introduction of the gas (from Gas Inlet) or evacuation of the system \n\n(towards the atmosphere, through valve 6, or towards the vacuum pump, through valve 7). \n\nValves Val 2 and 4 allow the isolation of the samples of adsorbent in the sample tanks when \n\nfeeding or evacuating the gas tanks.  \n\nThe oven used for adsorbents activation and temperature control is a GC 1000 from Dani \n\n(Dani Instruments Spa, Milan, Italy). \n\nTemperature sensors TS are PT-100 Resistance Temperature Detector probe (type PR-11-2-\n\nM30-300-MI-B) from Omega (Omega Engineering Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom). \n\nStainless steel tubing, tanks and fittings are from Swagelok. \n\nThe pressure transducers PS (Unik 5000, PMP 5013-TB-A3-CA-HO-PA, 0-2.5 bar (A) and \n\n0-10 bar (B), absolute) from GE are used to follow the pressure inside the tanks along the \n\nexperiment.  \n\nThe volume of the gas tanks (volume between valves 1 and 2) is 73.4 cm3 and 71.3 cm3, and \n\nthe volume of the sample tanks (including free volume of the tubes until valves 2 and 4) is \n\nof 24.8 cm3 and 26.4 cm3 for unit 1 and 2, respectively. These volumes were determined by \n\ntwo independent helium picnometry experiments. \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendices \n\n205 \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure A1.1. Manometric apparatus.

In this way, based on the molecular \nformula of organosilicas SiO1.5-R-SiO1.5, the percentage of carbon can be calculated as %C = [3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C / \n(1.5 \u00d7 At.Wt.O + 1 \u00d7 At.Wt.Si + 3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C + 2 \u00d7 At.Wt.H)] \u00d7 % T3 + [3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C / (2 \u00d7 At.Wt.O + 1 \u00d7 At.Wt.Si \n+ 3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C + 3 \u00d7 At.Wt.H)] \u00d7 % T2 + [3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C / (2.5 \u00d7 At.Wt.O + 1 \u00d7 At.Wt.Si + 3 \u00d7 At.Wt.C + 3 \u00d7 \nAt.Wt.H)] \u00d7 % T1, where At.Wt. stands for the atomic weights of the elements and % T3, % T2 and % T1 are \nthe percentages of Tm silanol species reported in Table A1.1. For instance, in the case of the C12-PMO material, \nthe formula above gives %C = [3 \u00d7 12.011 / (1.5 \u00d7 15.999 + 1 \u00d7 28.085 + 3 \u00d7 12.011 + 2 \u00d7 1.008)] \u00d7 66.58 + \n[3 \u00d7 12.011 / (2 \u00d7 15.999 + 1 \u00d7 28.085 + 3 \u00d7 12.011 + 3 \u00d7 1.008)] \u00d7 31.40 + [3 \u00d7 12.011 / (2.5 \u00d7 15.999 + 1 \u00d7 \n28.085 + 3 \u00d7 12.011 + 3 \u00d7 1.008)] \u00d7 2.02 = 38.70 %. The % C for the remaining samples are 38.68 %, 38.73 \n% and 38.39 %, respectively for PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO. The maximum difference observed \nbetween theoretical and experimental %C is 2.35 % for PhC16PMO. The good qualitative agreement supports \nthe consideration of the % T3, % T2 and % T1 for providing a quantitative measurement of the Tm environments \nin each sample, which is essential to support the function described by equation 3.1.4. bThe percentage of Si-\nO was determined by the equation % Si-O = 100 % - % C - % H - % N. \n \n\n\n\nAppendices \n\n213 \n\n \n\n \nFigure A1.8.
