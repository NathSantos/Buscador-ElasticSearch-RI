SOUTH-CENTRAL BRAZIL, CONSIDERING THE \n\nMANAGEMENT AND EXPANSION \n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \u2013 The substitution of fossil fuel with sugarcane ethanol aiming to reduce \nemissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has recently been debated because of the \npossible emissions incurred from land use change (LUC). This work was based on \nGHG inventory from cultivation and LUC of recently established sugarcane plantation \nin south-central Brazil, with the purpose of estimating the impact of expansion on GHG \nbalance, including emissions and removals due to LUC. Changes in quantity and \nquality of soil carbon (C) upon conversion of diverse agricultural systems (coffee, \ncitrus, annual crops and pasture) to sugarcane in southern Brazil were also assessed \nthrough field experiments. The estimates show that sugarcane cultivation and its \nexpansion during 2006-2011 in south-central Brazil presented an overall accumulated \nGHG balance of 217.1 Tg CO2eq by 2030, including emissions from cultivation \nactivities and emissions/removals due to LUC. Expansion of sugarcane plantation \ncontributed to attenuate part of GHG emissions from agricultural production phase. \nSimilarly, the ethanol C offset by displacing fossil fuels could readily payback that C \ndeficit. The data obtained by field experiments show that the LUC of coffee and citrus \nto sugarcane depleted soil C stock by 21.5% (26.8 Mg C ha-1) and 23.6% (34.9 Mg C \nha-1) in the 0-100 cm layer after a period of 3 and 4 years, respectively. In contrast, \nthere was no significant difference in soil C stocks in 0-100 cm depth upon conversion \nof pasture and annual crop into sugarcane. However, only the conversion of pasture \ninto sugarcane decreased soil C stock in 0-20 cm depth, with depletion of 13.3 Mg C \nha-1 (43.9%) over 8 years after the LUC. With regard to the quality of soil C, the data \nof Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) showed that the higher the losses \nof soil C, the greater was the humification index (HLIFS) of soil organic matter (SOM). \nIn general, conversion of the agrosystems (e.g., coffee, citrus, annual crop and \npasture) into sugarcane increased HLIFS of SOM. For some depths, HLIFS more than \ndoubled in comparison with the previous land uses. We expect that the results \nachieved in this work may contribute to the development of actions and public policies \nto strengthen strategies for GHG mitigation and ensure the environmental benefits of \nsugarcane ethanol in Brazil. \n \n\nKeywords: ethanol production, inventory, land use change, mitigation, sugarcane \nmanagement, climate change \n\n\n\nxiii \n\nBALAN\u00c7O DE GASES DE EFEITO ESTUFA ASSOCIADO \u00c0 PRODU\u00c7\u00c3O DE \nCANA-DE-A\u00c7\u00daCAR NO CENTRO-SUL DO BRASIL, CONSIDERANDO-SE O \n\nMANEJO E A EXPANS\u00c3O \n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \u2013 A substitui\u00e7\u00e3o dos combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis pelo etanol de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar \nvisando \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o das emiss\u00f5es de gases de efeito estufa (GEE) tem sido \nrecentemente questionada devido \u00e0s poss\u00edveis emiss\u00f5es decorrentes da mudan\u00e7a do \nuso da terra (MUT). Este trabalho se baseou no invent\u00e1rio de GEE do cultivo e da \nMUT associada \u00e0 expans\u00e3o da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no centro-sul do Brasil, com a \nfinalidade de estimar o impacto dessa expans\u00e3o no balan\u00e7o de GEE, incluindo as \nemiss\u00f5es e remo\u00e7\u00f5es devido \u00e0 MUT. Objetivou-se tamb\u00e9m, por meio de experimento \nde campo, avaliar as mudan\u00e7as na quantidade e qualidade do carbono (C) do solo \nap\u00f3s a convers\u00e3o de diferentes agrossistemas (caf\u00e9, citros, cultura anual e pastagem) \npara cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no sudeste do Brasil. As estimativas apontam que o cultivo da \ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar e sua expans\u00e3o durante 2006-2011 no centro-sul do Brasil resultaram \nno balan\u00e7o acumulado total de GEE de 217,1 Tg CO2eq em 2030, incluindo as \nemiss\u00f5es das atividades de cultivo e as emiss\u00f5es/remo\u00e7\u00f5es associadas \u00e0 MUT. As \nestimativas indicam que a expans\u00e3o dos canaviais contribuiu para atenuar parte das \nemiss\u00f5es de GEE da fase de produ\u00e7\u00e3o agr\u00edcola. Do mesmo modo, o uso de etanol \nem substitui\u00e7\u00e3o aos combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis poderia facilmente compensar esse d\u00e9ficit \nde C. Os resultados das avalia\u00e7\u00f5es de campo apontam que a convers\u00e3o de caf\u00e9 para \ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar resultou na deple\u00e7\u00e3o dos estoques de C do solo de 21,5% (26.8 Mg \nC ha-1) e 23,6% (34.9 Mg C ha-1) na camada de 0-100 cm ao longo dos per\u00edodos de 3 \ne 4 anos ap\u00f3s a MUT, respectivamente. As convers\u00f5es de pastagem e cultura anual \npara cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar n\u00e3o apresentaram diferen\u00e7as significativas na camada de 0-100 \ncm. Entretanto, apenas a transi\u00e7\u00e3o de pastagem para cana apresentou diferen\u00e7as \nsignificativas na camada de 0-20 cm, resultando na deple\u00e7\u00e3o dos estoques de C do \nsolo de 43,9% (13.3 Mg C ha-1) durante 8 anos ap\u00f3s a convers\u00e3o. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \nqualidade do C do solo, a t\u00e9cnica de espectroscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia induzida por \nlaser mostrou que quanto maior a perda de C no solo devido \u00e0 MUT para cana, maior \no \u00edndice de humifica\u00e7\u00e3o (HFIL) da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica do solo (MOS). Em geral, a \nconvers\u00e3o dos agrossistemas (caf\u00e9, citros, cultura anual e pastagem) para cana-de-\na\u00e7\u00facar promoveu o aumento do HFIL da MOS. Em algumas profundidades, o HFIL mais \ndo que dobrou em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos usos anteriores. Espera-se que os resultados gerados \nneste trabalho contribuam para o desenvolvimento de a\u00e7\u00f5es e pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas \nvisando fortalecer estrat\u00e9gias que possam potencializar ainda mais a mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o de \nGEE, e garantir os benef\u00edcios ambientais do etanol de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no Brasil. \n \n\nPalavras-chave: produ\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol, invent\u00e1rio, mudan\u00e7a do uso da terra, mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o, \nmanejo da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar, mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. \n\n \n\n\n\nxiv \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\n \n\n \n\nPage \n\nFigure 1 (Chapter 1).

The \n\natmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gases (GHG) has increased since 1750, \n\nmostly due to human activity. In 2011, the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), \n\nmethane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were 391 ppm, 1803 ppb, and 324 ppb, and \n\nexceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, 150%, and 20%, respectively (IPCC, \n\n2013). \n\nThe additional greenhouse effect has been largely driven by the burning of \n\nfossil fuels since the mid-20th century. Likewise, agriculture directly contributes with \n\n14% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and accounts for an additional emission \n\nof 17% when the conversion of land-use to agricultural production is taken into account \n\n(LYBBERT; SUMNER, 2012). The increased concentration of anthropogenic \n\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) is reported as a causal link between external drivers of climate \n\nchange and observed changes in climatic variables (e.g., precipitation intensity, \n\ncyclones, floods and droughts; IPCC, 2013). \n\nBeyond of its contribution to climate change, agriculture is also affected by \n\nthose impacts, with projections of additional risks for food security in the near future \n\n(SCHMIDHUBER; TUBIELLO, 2007). The effects of climate change on tropical \n\nagriculture could lead to decreased productivity and quality of agricultural goods, \n\nchanges in crop management and reduction of areas suitable for agricultural \n\nproduction, with social, economic and political consequences (CERRI et al., 2007a). \n\nUnfavorable climatic conditions over the last few years are among several other \n\naspects that have affected sugarcane plantations (Saccharum officinarum) with regard \n\nto productivity declines in different regions of Brazil (CONAB, 2014), dropping from \n\n115 ton ha-1 in 2008 to 69 ton ha-1 in 2012 (ANGELO, 2012). Simulations presented \n\nby ASSAD et al. (2004) indicate that the increased temperature over the next years \n\n\n\n2 \n\ncan result in a reduction of areas suitable for agricultural production in Brazil on more \n\nthan 95% in the states of Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo, and about 75% in \n\nParan\u00e1. \n\nUnlike the developed countries, climate change issues in Brazil are mostly \n\nrelated to land use and land-use change (LUC) as approximately 80% of the national \n\nGHG emissions in 2005 were sourced from agriculture and LUC sectors (MCT, 2010). \n\nHowever, public policies and interventions in beef and soy supply chains have already \n\ncontributed for the recent 70% decline in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia, and \n\nthis target may reach to a 90% reduction in 2018 (NEPSTAD et al., 2014). Even \n\nholding the largest potential for agricultural expansion in the coming years, Brazil has \n\nachieved impressive results in reducing GHG emissions by 40% since 2005 through \n\nthe reduction of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazonia (LAPOLA et al., 2013). \n\nThe characterization of how the changes on the soil use and management \n\naffects the dynamics of GHG emissions over time is something of great importance, \n\nespecially in tropical regions, to determine the impact of LUC on global climate. Soils \n\naccount for around 1,550 Pg of organic carbon (C), more than twice the amount of C \n\npresent in the atmosphere (720 Pg) and about three times more than the C of the \n\nterrestrial biota (LAL, 2001; FOLLETT, 2001). \n\nGreenhouse gas fluxes in agriculture are complex and heterogeneous, but \n\nmanagement practices in agricultural systems could offer mitigation opportunities. \n\nMoreover, practices that reduce the GHG emission at the same time they enhanced \n\nthe adaptive capacity of agricultural systems to climate change. This would increase \n\nagricultural yields and lead to increased food security (HARVEY et al., 2014). \n\nThe global technical potential for mitigation options in agriculture by 2030, \n\nconsidering all gases, was estimated to be ~5500-6000 MtCO2-eq year-1 (SMITH et \n\nal., 2008). Of the technical potential (\"high agreement, much evidence\") estimated by \n\nSMITH et al. (2008), about 89% is from restoring soil carbon (soil C sequestration), \n\nabout 9% from mitigation of CH4 and about 2% from mitigation of soil N2O emissions. \n\nLimiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of \n\nGHG emissions. Some options to mitigate climate change in agricultural areas include: \n\nimproved management of agricultural lands; improved pasture management, \n\nrestoration of cultivated organic soils; recovery of degraded lands, management of \n\n\n\n3 \n\nlivestock, manure/biosolid management and bioenergy production (IPCC, 2007). \n\nSMITH et al. (2008) estimated a global potential mitigation of 770 MtCO2-eq year-1 by \n\n2030 from improved energy efficiency in agriculture (e.g., through reduced fossil fuel \n\nuse). \n\nAs soil is the compartment where C is more concentrated in the terrestrial \n\nenvironment, and it is prone to LUC (CERRI et al., 2007b; MAIA et al., 2010), global \n\ninitiatives have arisen aiming to investigate the effects of LUC and its results in terms \n\nof GHG balance, considering emissions and sequestration (MILNE et al., 2007). \n\nMoreover, changes in management practices in the sugarcane cultivation have been \n\nconsidered as important as to the current expansion of the agricultural frontier (CERRI \n\net al., 2007b), since large areas are being converted from a burned harvest regime to \n\na non-burned green mechanized harvest in south-central Brazil. \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural areas \n\n \n\nAwareness of environmental issues in the medium and long term is essential \n\nfor sustainable development. It is necessary to develop a set of strategies that include \n\nadaptation, mitigation, and new researches to mitigate climate change. The United \n\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main \n\nmultilateral forum focused on addressing climate change. Guided by the uncertainties \n\nof the future and a strong concern on global climate, a common and differentiated \n\ncommitment has been established among all members, such as the reduction and \n\nstabilization of GHG concentrations in order to ensure the food security and economic \n\ndevelopment by limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2\u00b0C relative to pre-\n\nindustrial levels. \n\nIn the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) recently published \n\nby Brazilian government, and submitted to the UNFCCC under the Conference of the \n\nParties in Paris (COP21), Brazil has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 43% below \n\n2005 levels in 2030 and adopt further measures with a 2\u00b0C-increase temperature goal, \n\nin particular to restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forest by 2030 and \n\nstrengthen policies and measures to achieve zero illegal deforestation by 2030 in the \n\nBrazilian Amazonia (UNFCCC, 2015). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGovernment requirements for mitigation and adaptation to climate change \n\nresulted in methodologies as the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas \n\nInventories (IPCC, 2006). This is an important tool for estimating national inventories \n\nof anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHG, assisting \n\nparties in fulfilling their commitments under the UNFCCC. Such methodology is also \n\nimportant for quantifying and analyzing the potential impacts in terms of GHG balance \n\nassociated with agricultural production, aiming to guide the formulation of public \n\npolicies. \n\nThe determination of the potential GHG mitigation and the effective substitution \n\nof fossil fuels using sugarcane ethanol should be supported by studies of \n\nenvironmental impacts, particularly by methodologies aimed at analyzing the GHG \n\nbalance and consumption of fossil energy in different production systems. Studies of \n\nGHG inventories are adequate in this context as they allow a comprehensive analysis \n\nof the entire production chain. \n\nThe quantification of GHG emission from sugarcane ethanol has been triggered \n\nby the need of new studies in the scientific community. Several have demonstrated \n\nthe strategic advantages of sugarcane ethanol for mitigating GHG compared to other \n\nbioenergy crops in substitution of fossil fuels (NGUYEN et al., 2007; RENOUF et al., \n\n2008; B\u00d6RJESSON, 2009; GOLDEMBERG; GUARDABASSI, 2010). However, the \n\nrapid changes in both industrial and agricultural sectors continue to raise debate and \n\nrequire further analysis and discussion. \n\nFor instance, legal restrictions regarding the sugarcane pre-harvest burning, \n\nand the consequent increase of mechanical harvesting without burning could influence \n\nthe GHG balance in agricultural areas in various forms, since the quantities of diesel \n\nand agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilizer, vinasse, filter cake, limestone and pesticide) \n\nconsumed in the crop production vary according to the management system adopted, \n\nnamely with or without the burning practice. \n\nBORDONAL et al. (2012) reported that the conversion from a burnt to an \n\nunburnt sugarcane harvesting system, including the adoption of recommended \n\nmanagement practices (e.g., reduced soil tillage and crop rotation with N-fixing crops \n\nduring sugarcane field renovation), could save from 1223.6 to 1587.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 \n\nyear-1. In S\u00e3o Paulo state, GHG emissions from harvesting operations in sugarcane \n\n\n\n5 \n\nfields have decreased by approximately 37.6% over the last 20 years, from 1.015 ton \n\nCO2eq ha-1 in 1990 to 0.633 ton CO2eq ha-1 in 2009 (CAPAZ et al., 2013). Government \n\nactions are already becoming effective for reducing sugarcane straw burning \n\n(FRAN\u00c7A et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n1.1.3 Sugarcane ethanol and the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation \n\n \n\nIncreases in energy supply from solar, wind, hydraulic and bioenergy sources \n\nhave been enhanced by the growing concern on GHG emissions from fossil fuels, \n\ndepletion of petroleum reserves, and risks of climate change and extreme events \n\n(LAL, 2014). Biofuels are one of the few technologies that may result in negative \n\nGHGs emissions through replacement of fossil fuels, and a reduction of up 85% has \n\nbeen reported for sugarcane-based ethanol (B\u00d6RJESSON, 2009). In addition, they \n\nare widely propounded by presenting potential benefits such as restoring degraded \n\nsoils, increasing both C budgets in soil and biomass, and also cooling the local climate \n\n(LOARIE et al., 2011; LAL, 2014). \n\nBrazil already has one of the largest and most successful biofuel programs to \n\ndate, including cogeneration of electricity using biomass. The sugarcane production \n\nis mostly concentrated in the south-central region of Brazil, accounting for about 90% \n\nof the total cultivated area in 2015. S\u00e3o Paulo is the state with the largest expansion \n\nof sugarcane plantation during the last years, holding around 60% of the cultivated \n\narea in south-central Brazil (UNICA, 2015). \n\nThe Brazilian Alcohol Program (Pro\u00e1lcool) was launched in 1975 aiming to \n\nreduce the reliance on oil imports through production of sugarcane-based ethanol, \n\nand the environmental benefits were soon recognized by presenting an avoided \n\nemission of 27.5 Tg CO2equivalent in 2003 due to substitution of gasoline use in Brazil \n\n(MACEDO, 2005). On a global scale, Brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol \n\nand represents nearly 33% of the worldwide production, which could play an important \n\nrole in supplying future ethanol needs (CERQUEIRA LEITE et al., 2009). \n\nSeveral food crops are used for biofuels production, including grains (maize, \n\nsorghum and wheat), sugar crops (sugarcane, sugar beet), starch crops (cassava), \n\nand oilseed crops (soybean and oil palm). Nevertheless, the GHG savings achieved \n\n\n\n6 \n\nby biofuels are strongly reliant on the feedstock alternative considered and the \n\nmanagement practices associated to its agricultural production (DAVIS et al., 2013). \n\nRecent analysis of the energy balance and GHGs emissions from alternative options \n\nof biofuels started a major controversy and discussions about the true outcomes \n\nrelated to its sustainability (MACEDO et al., 2008; RENOUF et al., 2008; SEABRA et \n\nal., 2011; TSAO et al., 2011; DUNN et al., 2013). \n\nCertain basic issues on the expansion of biofuels remain under debate \n\nworldwide, especially regarding the land requirements to supply the future demand of \n\nethanol (LEAL et al., 2013). Ethanol production from corn and sugarcane is expected \n\nto increase from 80 to approximately 200 billion liters in 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., \n\n2014). In order to achieve this target in an environmentally sound manner, several \n\naspects regarding the production of sugarcane ethanol must be assessed, i.e., land \n\nuse change (FARGIONE et al., 2008; LAPOLA et al., 2010; MELLO et al., 2014), air \n\nquality (TSAO et al., 2011), GHG balance associated with sugarcane cultivation \n\n(BORDONAL et al., 2012), farm inputs (LAL, 2004) and, the energy balance and C \n\nfootprint (LAL, 2014). \n\nThere is a growing need for all productive sectors to develop GHG mitigation \n\ntechniques to combat global warming. Inventorying the potential for GHG mitigation in \n\nsugarcane fields in southern Brazil, BORDONAL et al. (2013) estimated that changes \n\nin management practices during the sugarcane cultivation, such as the conversion of \n\nharvest system from a burnt to an unburnt regime and the reduced soil tillage in \n\naddition to the introduction of an N-fixing crop during crop renovation, if adopted, could \n\nresult in GHG mitigation potentials ranging from 50.5 to 70.9 Mt CO2eq over the period \n\nfrom 2012 to 2050 (Figure 1). Therefore, the adoption of management practices that \n\nlead to a reduction of GHG emissions in sugarcane areas could contribute \n\nconsiderably to achieving the objectives set by Brazilian government to curb \n\nemissions, in addition to promoting sustainable production of sugar and ethanol in \n\nBrazil. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Avoided greenhouse gas emissions (in Mton CO2equivalent) from 2012 to \n2050 due to the conversion of remaining sugarcane areas harvested with \nburning (2011 harvest season \u2013 1,670,521 ha) to green harvest scenarios \nin S\u00e3o Paulo State \u2013 Brazil, S1 (conventional soil tillage) or S2 (reduced soil \ntillage and crop rotation), based on three conversion rates (red bar based \non State Law \u2013 rate 1; green bar based on Protocol \u2013 rate 2; and blue bar \nbased on real data observed \u2013 rate 3). Source: BORDONAL et al. (2013). \n\n \n\nHowever, concerns regarding the extent to what the expansion of sugarcane \n\nplantation have caused deforestation and/or displacement of food crops arise \n\nquestions about its sustainability (NGUYEN et al., 2010; WALTER et al., 2011). \n\nEnergy crops have expanded significantly in Brazil. Between 2005 and 2010 about 4 \n\nmillion hectares of sugarcane were incorporated into the existing cultivated areas in \n\nsouth-central Brazil (ADAMI et al., 2012), totaling 9.6 million hectares cultivated in \n\n2015 (UNICA, 2015). Such expansion has turned the sugarcane as the main source \n\nof renewable energy in Brazil, accounting for 15.7% of the domestic energy supply in \n\n2014 (BRASIL, 2015). \n\nThe LUC due to agricultural expansion can result in GHG emissions, mainly \n\nCO2. Such emissions derive from the burning of native vegetation, decomposition of \n\nplant material and oxidation of soil organic matter (CERRI et al., 2007b; FEARNSIDE \n\net al., 2009). This is due to the change of organic material input in the production \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsystem, and can be altered in a negative way, with a reduction of carbon stocks, or \n\npositively, with an increase of carbon stocks (MAIA et al., 2010). \n\nGHGs emissions from LUC may be significant depending on how biofuels are \n\nproduced (SEARCHINGER et al., 2008), so that the carbon savings from sugarcane \n\nethanol could be negated by any pressure of the production expansion over native \n\nforests or grasslands (LAPOLA et al., 2010). The soil C debt associated with the \n\nconversion from native vegetation and pastoral lands to sugarcane plantation has a \n\npayback time of 8 and 2-3 years, respectively (MELLO et al., 2014). Additionally, \n\nFARGIONE et al. (2008) reported that the conversion from Cerrado wooded to \n\nsugarcane plantation in Brazil releases ~165 Mg CO2 ha-1 over 50 years and requires \n\n17 years to repay the \"carbon debt\". \n\nConversely, the replacement of marginal or degraded lands by sugarcane \n\nplantation can offset some anthropogenic emissions by recycling atmospheric CO2 \n\n(LAL, 2014). Sugarcane plantation has a potential to store from 15.9 to 29.2 Mg C    \n\nha-1 yr-1 into biomass (BEEHARRY, 2001; RONQUIM, 2007), and the replacement of \n\necosystems with the lowest C stocks (e.g., degraded grasslands) by energy crops with \n\nhigher yields (e.g., sugarcane and oil palm), may reduce or even eliminate the \n\npayback time of the C debt incurred from LUC (GIBBS et al., 2008). \n\nThe magnitude of changes in both C reservoirs (e.g., biomass and soil) \n\nfollowing LUC can directly affect the GHG balance associated with sugarcane \n\ncultivation and is relevant for assessing the C savings from sugarcane ethanol use in \n\nsubstitution of fossil fuels. Remote sensing satellite images are an effective tool in \n\nmonitoring the management and expansion of sugarcane plantation (RUDORFF et \n\nal., 2010; AGUIAR et al., 2011; ADAMI et al., 2012), allowing the generation of \n\naccurate information that can serve as a basis for studies on GHG balance. \n\nSince 2006, the National Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional de \n\nPesquisas Espaciais; INPE) monitors the direct land use change (dLUC) associated \n\nwith sugarcane expansion and delineates areas under sugarcane cultivated with \n\nspecific management and harvest practices (e.g., manual harvest with prior burning \n\nvs. green mechanized harvest without burning) in south-central Brazil. \n\nIn this context, there are consolidated methodologies to assess the impact of \n\ndLUC and sugarcane cultivation in terms of GHG balance, as proposed by the \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC (2006)\". This methodology \n\nentitled \"IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories\" allows \n\ndetermining GHG emissions from agricultural production, and losses or gains of C \n\nstocks in biomass (above- and below-ground) and soil following the dLUC. \n\n \n\n1.2 General goals \n\n \n\nThe objectives of this work were: (i) to estimate the greenhouse gas balance \n\nfrom cultivation and direct land use change of recently expanded sugarcane plantation \n\nin south-central Brazil (Chapter 2); and (ii) to assess the changes in quantity and \n\nquality of soil carbon due to the main land-use conversions to sugarcane plantation in \n\nsouthern Brazil (Chapter 3). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n1.3 References \n\n \n\nADAMI, M.; THEODOR RUDORFF, B.
