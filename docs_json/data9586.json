The purpose of this study was to evaluate the photosynthetic rate of E. densa in two rivers (Aguape\u00fa and \nMambu) with different limnological features, both located  in the Itanha\u00e9m River Basin. This species is abundant in \nboth rivers without causing damages to their multiple uses. Photosynthetic rates were analysed in February, May, \nAugust and November 1998 and limnological variables of the water and sediment were also measured. The highest \nvalue of gross photosynthesis (GP) was detected in May (10.06 in Aguape\u00fa and 6.10 mgO2/gDW/h in Mambu), when \nunder-water photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was also high (1,126.7 and 895.8 \u00b5mol/m/s, respectively). GP, \ntotal phosphorous, total CO2 and PAR were always higher in Aguape\u00fa River.  \n \nKey words: Aquatic macrophyte, Egeria densa, photosynthetic rate, Brazil \n \n \n\n                                                        \n*Author for correspondence \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \nAquatic macrophytes are considered to be one of \nthe main primary producers in shallow water \necosystems; they show a great capacity to adapt to \nchanging environmental conditions and, as a \nconsequence, show a great ecological amplitude \n(Camargo and Esteves, 1995; Esteves, 1998). \nThese characteristics, together with modifications \nof the environment caused by man, result in an \nundesirable growth of several species in some \naquatic ecosystems. \nThe excessive growth of aquatic macrophytes is a \nresult of human activities, which create favourable \nconditions for their growth (Seshavatharam, 1990). \nAccording to Madsen (1998), the nonnative \nsubmerged species which cause most problems \n\n(affecting navigation, hydroelectric power \ngeneration, water supply, recreation and flood \ncontrol) in the United States are Hydrilla \nverticillata (L.f.) Royle, Myriophyllum spicatum \nL. and Egeria densa Planch, known as Brazilian \nelodea. These three species have biological and \nphysiological  characteristics  that  enable  them to \nexploit the aquatic environment in an opportunistic \nway, growing and reproducing in sub-optimal \nconditions, even when in competition with other \nspecies (Spencer and Bowes, 1990). \nFor the management of submerged species, it is \nimportant to know about the conditions that favour \nand/or limit their growth, and one way is to \nestimate the photosynthetic rate. The \nphotosynthesis and respiration rates of submerged \nmacrophytes are directly related to temperature \n\n\n\nPezzato, M. M. and Camargo, A. F. M. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n154 \n\nand light (Menendez and Pe\u00f1uelas, 1993; \nMenendez and Sanches, 1998), as well as to \nnutrient availability, including dissolved carbon \nand oxygen (Sand-Jensen, 1989; Madsen and \nSand-Jensen, 1994; Feijo\u00f3 et al., 1996; Madsen et \nal., 1998). These variables can affect the \nphotosynthetic characteristics of the plant, both \nseasonally (e.g. light and temperature) and diurnally \n(e.g. O2 and CO2), and as such they can have \ncombined effects in modifying the photosynthetic \ncharacteristics (Sand-Jensen, 1989). \nE. densa and Egeria najas Planch. are two \nsubmerged macrophyte species that have been \ngrowing   abundantly in some of the Brazilian \nreservoirs, and so having adverse effects on the \nhydroelectric power generation (Thomas et al., \n1999). However, studies about limnological \nfeatures that influence their growth and \nphotosynthetic rates are few, especially, in their \nnative habitats.  \nThe objective of this study was to measure the \nphotosynthetic rates of E. densa and to determine \nthe main limnological variables involved in the \ncontrol of the photosynthesis and respiration of \nthis species. \n \n \nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n \nThe measurements of photosynthesis, respiration \nand of the physicochemical characteristics of the \nwater and sediment were taken in quarterly \nintervals during 1998: February (summer), May \n(autumn), August (winter) and November (spring). \nThe photosynthetic rate was measured in sites \nwhere E. densa occurred in both rivers using water \nfrom their own environment. Clear (97% of \ntransparency) and dark flasks with ca. 2000 ml \ncapacity were filled up with water using a siphon. \nApical branches of E. densa, with approximately \n15 cm length (0.35 g of dry weight) were placed in \neach flask. The incubations were done in triplicate. \nFor further correction of the photosynthesis and \nrespiration of the macrophyte, the production and \nrespiration of the phytoplankton was measured \nfrom one clear and one dark flask that did not \ncontain the plant. The incubations were placed on \nthe surface and at the bottom of the river (0.9 to \n1.8 m depending on the river and sampling \nperiod), in horizontal position, for a period of 4 h \n(approximately 10:00 to 14:00 h).  Afterwards the \nwater from the flasks was siphoned to 150 ml \nflasks for the measurements of dissolved O2 \n\n(mg/L) using the Winkler\u2019s method (Golterman   \net al., 1978). The titration was made by an \nelectronic burette (Scohtt Gerate, model T 80/10). \nDry weight of the plant material used in the \nincubations was obtained by drying it at 60\u00baC until \nconstant weight. \nThe gross and net photosynthesis and the \nrespiration were calculated using the following \nequations described in Vollenweider (1974): \n\n \nNP = (c-i)v/(t.DW) \nR = (i-d)v/(t.DW) \nGP = NPP + R \n\n \nNP being the net photosynthesis (mgO2/gDW/h), \nR: respiration (mgO2/gDW/h), GP: gross \nphotosynthesis (mgO2/gDW/h), c: O2 \nconcentration in the clear flask and d in the dark \nflasks (mg/L), i: initial O2 concentration in the \nflasks (mg/L), v: flask volume (L), t: incubation \ntime (h) and DW: plant dry weight (grams).  \nAt the beginning of the incubation, values of pH, \nelectrical conductivity (El. cond.) (\u00b5S/cm), \ntemperature (\u00b0C) and turbidity (NTU) were taken \nin triplicates, using the Water Quality Checker, \nHoriba (model U10). The photosynthetic active \nradiation (PAR) (\u00b5mol/m2/s) was measured with \nthe Light Meter LiCor (model 189) coupled to an \nunderwater Quantum Sensor Licor (model 192) \nand the coefficient of the vertical attenuation (k) \nwas calculated using the following equation: k = \n(ln.Io - ln.I)/z, where ln is the natural logarithm, I \nis the PAR at a determined depth (m), Io is the \nPAR at the surface and z is the depth (m) (Wetzel, \n1975). Water (1 L) for further measurement of the \ntotal alkalinity (meq/L), by titration, and total CO2 \nconcentration (mg/L), according to Mackereth et \nal. (1978) was sampled, in triplicates, from the site \nwhere the incubation had been carried out. \nApproximately 0.5 L  of the water sample was \nfiltered (Whatman GF/C) in the field laboratory, \nkept in polyethylene flasks and frozen to -20 \u00baC. \nNon filtered samples (0.5 L) were also frozen in \nthe same manner. \nThe concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen (N-\nammoniacal) (\u00b5g/L) (Koroleff, 1976), nitrite (N-\nNO2) (\u00b5g/L), nitrate (N-NO3) (\u00b5g/L) and total \ndissolved N (TDN) (mg/L) (Mackereth et al., \n1978) as well as total dissolved P (TDP) (\u00b5g/L) \nand orthophosphates (P-PO4) (\u00b5g/L) (Golterman  \net al., 1978) were measured from the filtered \nsamples in the Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology \n\n\n\nPhotosynthetic Rate of the Aquatic Macrophyte Egeria densa Planch. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n155 \n\nfrom the Department of Ecology of UNESP/Rio \nClaro-SP. The total suspended matter (Susp. \nmatter) (\u00b5g/L) was determined according to \nClesceri et al. (1989). The non-filtered water \nsamples were used to determine total nitrogen \n(TN) (mg/L) (Mackereth et al., 1978) and total \nphosphorus (TP) ( \u00b5g L-1) (Golterman et al., 1978).  \nSamples sediment were also collected in triplicates \nto measure total nitrogen (TN) (%PS), using the \nKjeldahl method (Allen et al., 1974), and total \nphosphorus (TP) (%PS) (Esteves, 1980) and \norganic matter (Org. matter) (%PS) by incineration \nat 500 \u00b0C. \nApical branches of E. densa were also collected in \ntriplicate from the banks of the two rivers, near the \nsite where the incubation was carried out, for \nfurther measurement of chlorophyll a and b (%PS) \nusing the method by Vollenweider (1974). For \nthese measurements, fresh branches of E. densa \nwere washed to remove periphyton and debris and \nkept frozen in the dark to avoid chlorophyll \ndegradation. \nThe Principal Components Analysis (Ludwig and \nReynolds, 1988), based on the abiotic variables \nmeasured, was used to ordinate the sites (rivers) and \ndata collection times. For this analysis and for the \nvariance analysis (ANOVA), the statistic software \nSYSTAT (version 5.03) was used (Wilkinson, \n1990). For the analysis of variance the data were \ntransformed, if necessary, and   differences were \nconsidered significant when p &lt;0.05. \n \n \nSTUDY AREA \n \nThis study was carried out in the Aguape\u00fa and \nMambu rivers located in the hydrographic basin of \nthe Itanha\u00e9m River. In these rivers, E. densa grows \nin dense stands but does not influence the river\u2019s \nmultiple uses. This hydrographic basin has a total \narea of 900 km2 and it is located on the South \ncoast of S\u00e3o Paulo State, South-eastern Brazil \n(Camargo et al., 1997). \nFifty percent of the basin is located in a mountain \nrange region with altitudes varying between 500 \nand 1000 m, covered by dense vegetation of a well \npreserved area of tropical rain forest in the State \nPark of the Sea Range (Parque Estadual da Serra \ndo Mar). The remaining 50% of the area of the \nbasin are located in the coastal plain with an \n\naltitude up to 20 m and a well preserved       \nnatural vegetation in some parts and disturbed \nareas consisting of banana farms. The middle    \nand final sections of the two rivers meander    \nthrough the coastal plain with a slow current \n(Camargo et al., 1997). \nAguape\u00fa River has black water while Mambu \nRiver has clear water, both rivers have low current \nvelocity (0.4 cm/s in Aguape\u00fa River and 0.3 cm/s \nin Mambu River). In the coastal plain, the \nAguape\u00fa River is colonised by several macrophyte \nspecies, including floating species (e.g. Pistia \nstratiotes L., Salvinia molesta D.S. Mitchell, \nEichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms), emergent \nspecies (e.g. Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth), \nfloating leaves species (e.g. Nymphaea rudgeana \nC. F. Mey) and submerged species (Cabomba   \nfurcata Schult and Schult. f., Egeria densa \nPlanch.), while the Mambu River is colonised  \nonly by submerged species (Cabomba furcata, \nEgeria densa). \nAccording to Lamparelli and Moura (1998), the \nclimate of the region presents little variation due to \nits latitude and the proximity to the Atlantic \nOcean. Rain is abundant (annual mean of 2183 \nmm) and well distributed throughout the year, with \nmore rainfall in March (279.9 mm) and less in \nAugust (84.7 mm). The atmospheric temperature \nin the region is high, with a minimum mean of \n19.0 \u00baC (July) and a maximum mean of 26.2 \u00baC \n(February). There is little variation of the annual \nphotoperiod with slightly longer days in summer \n(13 h) than in winter (11 h). Solar radiation varies \nmainly according to the alternation of sunny and \nrainy days during all seasons of the year.  \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe values of the physical and chemical variables \nof the water and the sediment of the Aguape\u00fa \nRiver are presented in Table 1. The water \ntemperature variation was small during the period \nof analysis, with a maximum of 23.7 \u00baC in \nFebruary and a minimum of 20.2 \u00baC in August and \nNovember. The highest amount of dissolved CO2 \nwas found in the water of the Aguape\u00fa River, with \na maximum of 5.45 mg/L in November and a \nminimum of 3.08 mg/L in August.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPezzato, M.

On the left side of \nFactor I, are the data for Mambu River (13/02/98, \n01/05/98, 12/08/98 and 04/11/98) and 13/08/98 in \nthe Aguape\u00fa River showing lower temperatures, \ntotal CO2 and phosphorous concentrations in the \nwater and sediment and higher levels of dissolved \n\nO2 in the water. On the right side of Factor I are \nthe data taken from the Aguape\u00fa River (12/02/98, \n02/05/98 and 05/11/98) showing to have opposite \ncharacteristics compared to the ones from the left \nside. In relation to Factor II, it was observed that \nin May, in both rivers, the values obtained for \nPAR in the surface were higher than the values \nobtained in the other months, whereas TN \nconcentration in the water were lower.  \nThe concentrations of chlorophyll a and b in E. \ndensa in the Aguape\u00fa and Mambu rivers are \npresented in Table 5.

At \nthe same time, a small variation in the contents of \nchlorophyll a and b of E. densa from both rivers \nwas also observed implying that there were no \n\nperiods of growth and senescence (Table 5). It has \nbeen reported that in tropical regions, there was no \nsignificant seasonal changes in the biomass of \nemergent and submerged species of macrophytes \nand that the growth of the aquatic vegetation \noccurred throughout the year (Payne, 1986; \nEsteves and Camargo, 1986). Menendez and \nSanches (1998) noticed differences between the \nminimum and maximum NP for Potamogeton \n\nF a c t o r  I\n\nF\nac\n\nto\nr \n\nII Mb. 08/98 \n\nAg. 08/98 Mb. 02/98 \n\nMb. 11/98 \n\nMb. 05/98 \n\nAg. 05/98 \n\nAg. 11/98 \n\nAg. 02/98 \n\n\n\nPezzato, M. M. and Camargo, A. F. M. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n160 \n\npectinatus (approximately 10 times) and for Chara \nhispida (approximately 5 times). They also \nobserved that the values for photosynthetic rates, \ntemperature and chlorophyll a and b were \ngenerally higher in spring and summer. In a \ncoastal lake in the Northeast of Spain, Menendez \nand Pe\u00f1uelas (1993) measured a NP two times \nhigher for Ruppia cirrhosa in spring than in \nautumn and winter. These differences have been \nattributed to the seasonal variations of light  and \ntemperature (minimum 7\u00b0C and maximum 30\u00b0C) \nand to the stage of the plant development, autumn \nand winter coinciding with the senescence period.  \nComparison of the data obtained in this study for \nNP (maximum and minimum) with data from \nother investigations, carried out in temperate \nregions, showed evidence of a small amplitude \nbetween maximum and minimum values of NP for \nE. densa (Table 6). This small annual range of NP \nwas probably due to the climatic conditions with \nnarrow seasonal variation.  \nThere was a small difference in E. densa \nphotosynthetic rates measured on the surface of \nthe water in both rivers among the periods of \nanalysis. However, in May the measurements for \nGP, NP and R taken from the Mambu River were \nsignificantly higher from those obtained in the \nother months.  \nThe higher values of photosynthetic rates obtained \nin May were probably related to the higher values \nof PAR measured in the same month. It could be \nimportant to mention that the measurements taken \non May 1998 (01 and 02) were the only ones taken \non sunny days and the PAR in the study area was \nmainly correlated to the occurrence of sunny and \nrainy days. The lowest value for GP was measured \nat the bottom of the Aguape\u00fa River in February \nand this coincided with the lowest PAR measured. \nOther authors like Madsen and Sand-Jensen \n(1994), working with Elodea canadensis and \nCallitriche cophocarpa, also observed a positive \nrelationship between photosynthesis and light \nintensity. \nIt was observed that there was a difference \nbetween the GP values from the surface and       \nthe ones from the bottom of the Aguape\u00fa River \n(the former being nine times higher) while the \nresults obtained from the Mambu River were \nalmost the same. The low values for the bottom of \nthe Aguape\u00fa River were probably related to the \nlow PAR attributed to the high value of k in this \nriver.  The high k value was probably due to the \ndark colour (black) of the water from this river, \n\nbecause the values obtained for the suspended \nmatter and the depth for the two rivers were \nsimilar. The lowest GP values were measured at \nthe bottom of Aguape\u00fa River, but the values for \nthe GP on the surface of this river were in average, \napproximately two times higher than the ones from \nthe Mambu River. \nThe higher gross photosynthesis of E. densa in the \nAguape\u00fa River was also probably related to the \nhighest amounts of total CO2 in the water of this \nriver. The inorganic carbon concentration in the \nwater was an important factor that controlled the \ngrowth of the submerged macrophyte. Steemann-\nNielsen (1960) stated that the elodeid angiosperms \nwere rare or absent in lakes with low levels of total \nCO2. Madsen and Sand-Jensen (1987) observed \nthat the growth of Elodea canadensis was very \nslow in low total CO2 concentrations, whereas \nMadsen and Sand-Jensen (1994) measured, under \nlaboratory conditions, increased photosynthesis in \nE. canadensis and C. cophocarpa following an \nincrease in total inorganic carbon. The higher \nphosphorus concentrations in the water and \nsediment of the Aguape\u00fa River could also explain \nthe higher GP from the surface of this river.  \nIt was possible to conclude, based on the results \npresented in this paper, that the parameters which \ncontrolled the photosynthetic rate of E. densa were \nthe PAR and the total CO2 and phosphorous \nconcentration in the water and sediment. E. densa \nalso grew in less favourable conditions, but with \nlower values of net photosynthesis. The survival \nability of E. densa under unfavourable conditions \nwas also demonstrated by Feijo\u00f3 et al. (1996) and \nthis could explain the undesirable growth of E. \ndensa in some aquatic ecosystems when the \nconditions are sub-optimal. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe thank Ana Maria Monteiro for the translation \nthe manuscript into English and Prof. Dr. Orlando \nNecchi Junior for the constructive comments and \nCarlos Fernando Sanches for the help in the field \nwork.
