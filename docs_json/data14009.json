Few studies establish relative efficiency of reactivity (RER) for\nsilicate particle-size fractions, therefore, the RER applied for lime are used. This study aimed to evaluate the reactivity\nof silicate materials affected by particle size throughout incubation periods in comparison to lime, and to calculate\nthe RER for silicate particle-size fractions. Six correction sources were evaluated: three slags from distinct origins,\ndolomitic and calcitic lime separated into four particle-size fractions (2, 0.84, 0.30 and&lt;0.30-mm sieves), and\nwollastonite, as an additional treatment. The treatments were applied to three soils with different texture classes.\nThe dose of neutralizing material (calcium and magnesium oxides) was applied at equal quantities, and the only\nvariation was the particle-size material. After a 90-day incubation period, the RER was calculated for each particle-\nsize fraction, as well as the RR and ECC of each source. The neutralization of soil acidity of the same particle-size\nfraction for different sources showed distinct solubility and a distinct reaction between silicates and lime. The RER\nfor slag were higher than the limits established by Brazilian legislation, indicating that the method used for limes\nshould not be used for the slags studied here.\n\nKey words: soil acidity, steel slag, ECC.\n\nAng\u00e9lica Cristina Fernandes Deus2, Leonardo Theodoro B\u00fcll3, Juliano Corulli Corr\u00eaa4, Roberto Lyra Villas Boas3\n\n\n\n266 Ang\u00e9lica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSoil acidity is one of the major chemical attributes\nrelated to plant growth as it affects the occurrence of\nphytotoxic elements and the availability of most nutrients.\nLime is the most used corrective to neutralize soil acidity.\nHowever, studies show that silicate materials have great\npotential to improve soil chemical characteristics, mainly\nby increasing the pH. SiO\n\n3\n2- is the neutralizing agent in\n\nsilicates, which reacts with water releasing OH- ions that\nneutralize H+ and Al3+ phytotoxic (Prado et al., 2001),\nconsequently increasing Ca, Mg and base saturation\n(Brassioli et al., 2009; Corr\u00eaa et al., 2009). Slags are a silicon\nsource (Souza &amp; Korndorfer 2010) as well as enhancing\nnutrient uptake by plants (Fonseca et al., 2011).\n\nIn Brazil, steel mills provide slag, an abundant silicate\nsource, at a very low cost. Slag has already been used in\nagriculture in the United States, Japan, and China. Many\nstudies have recently reported on the viability of using\nslag in several crops such as soybean (Corr\u00eaa et al., 2008),\nrice (Barbosa Filho et al., 2004), sugar cane (Brassioli et al.,\n2009), and sorghum (Barbosa et al., 2008), among others.\nYet further information on these materials is required,\nespecially related to RER for particle-size fractions.\n\nEfficiency and quality of sources used in soil acidity\ncorrection are indicated by ECC and depend on the RER of\nparticle-size fractions, (LOPES et al., 1990). No information\nis available regarding the reactivity of silicate particle-size\nfractions, thus carbonate reactivity rates are used.\n\nThe RER of corrective sources established for particle-\nsize fractions are determined based on liming materials.\nReactivity values established by ABNT (Brazilian\nTechnical Standards Association) standard sieves are: 0\nfor particles retained in sieve #10, fractions > 2.00 mm;\n20% for retention in sieve #20, fractions from 2.00 to 0.84\nmm; 60% for retention in sieve #50, fractions from 0.84 to\n0.30 mm; and 100% for fractions &lt;0.30 mm sieved through\n#50. These values represent the percentage of reaction in\nthe soil for three months (Brasil, 2006). However, particles\nfrom silicate sources are more porous, due to the fusion\nduring the steel making processes, which increases the\nspecific surface area of the slag fractions ensuring greater\nreaction speed of dissociation. The presence of the\naccompanying anion SiO\n\n3\n confers a six or seven-fold\n\nincrease of solubility compared to lime, where CO\n3 \nis the\n\nanion (Alcarde, 1992). Therefore, rates of RER applied to\nlime are not appropriate to determine silicate reactivity,\nbecause the rates underestimate the neutralization capacity\nof silicate sources and, consequently, overestimate the\namount to be applied for soil acidity correction.\n\nIt is essential to study the RER for silicate particle-size\nfractions to establish appropriate recommendations for\nsoil acidity correction. This study aimed to evaluate the\nreactivity of silicate materials affected by particle size\n\nduring incubation periods in comparison to lime reactivity,\nand to calculate the RER for silicate particle-size fractions.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThe study was conducted under greenhouse\nconditions in Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. Treatments\nwere tested in three soils collected in Botucatu: Rhodic\nHapludox (RH), Typic Quartzipsamment (TQ) and Alfisol\nFerrudalfs (AF) (Soil Taxonomy, 2010) (Table 1). The ex-\nperimental design was completely randomized with four\nreplications, analyzed as a 5 x 4 +1 factorial, five sources\nfor soil acidity correction (Table 2) and four particle-size\nfractions, and an additional treatment (wollastonite).\n\nIt was used three slags from distinct origins (slags 1\nand 2, originated from steel provided by Mannesmann\u00ae\n\nand Silifertil\u00ae, respectively and slag 3 originated from\nstainless steel provided by Recmix \u00ae), as well as\nwollastonite, dolomitic lime, and calcitic lime. Wollastonite\nis an international standard of calcium silicate, mostly used\nin studies to compare different silicate sources.\n\nExcept for wollastonite, the sources were separated\ninto four particle-size fractions established by Brazilian\nlegislation for lime (Brasil, 2006), described as ABNT #10\n- corresponding to particles retained by #10 sieve, with\ndiameter > 2 mm; ABNT #20 - corresponding to particles\nsieved through #10, but not #20, with diameter between\n2-0.84 mm; ABNT #50 - corresponding to particles sieved\nthrough #20, but not #50, with diameter between 0.84-0.30\n\n\n\n267Determination of Reactivity Rates of Silicate Particle-size Fractions\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nmm; ABNT &lt;50 - corresponding to particles sieved\nthrough #50, with diameter &lt;0.30 mm.\n\nA previous experiment was carried out for three months\nto establish the doses to be used. The same materials\ntested in this experiment were separated in particle-size\nfractions and applied at increasing amounts (0, 1, 2, 4, and\n8 t ha-1) in the three soils. The previous study allowed to\nobtain the neutralization fitting curve for each source and\nparticle-size to calculate the dose to increase the pH (CaCl\n\n2\n)\n\nof each soil class to 5.5 (Table 3). In the first experiment,\nthe 2-mm fraction of slag 1 and lime, except calcitic lime\napplied in TQ, did not influence soil pH; therefore, the\ndose could not be calculated. In this case, it was used the\ndose calculated for the 0.84-mm fraction.\n\nThe experimental units consisted of plastic pots with\npunched lids. Each filled with 1 kg of soil and the material\nto increase the pH (CaCl\n\n2\n) to 5.5, according to particle-\n\nsize and source (Table 3). The soil moisture was kept at\n70% of field capacity, through weekly weighing. At the\nend of each incubation period (30, 60, and 90 days), soil\nsamples were collected to determine the pH (CaCl\n\n2\n) (Raij\n\net al., 2001). Considering the pH variations after 90 days,\nit was evaluated the RER for particle-size fractions.\nAccording to Brazilian legislation, reactivity of dolomitic\nlime is considered 100% for particle-size fractions &lt;0.30\nmm. Therefore, this was considered the reference value to\ncalculate the increase in all other fractions and corrective\nsources.\n\nIt was analyzed the RER for each fraction and source\nto calculate an average value for all three soils. This value\nwas used to calculate the RR of corrective sources\naccording to their particle size (Table 2) in the equation:\n\nbeing: F1, F2 ..... Fn = rate of particle-size fractions\n   RE1, RE2 ..... REn = rate of relative efficiency\n\nreactivity for each particle-size fraction\n\nAfterwards, the ECC was calculated for each correction\nsource, hereby denominated Experimental ECC, in the\nfollowing equation:\n\n\n\n268 Ang\u00e9lica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nbeing: NP = neutralization power, obtained in\nlaboratory\n\n           RR = reactivity rate\n\nThe NP was determined by the acid base titration\nmethod (Alcarde, 2009). The results were submitted to\nthe analysis of variance (F test). The means were compared\nin the Tukey test (p &lt;0.05) whenever significant differences\noccurred.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nConsidering the same particle-size fraction of\ncorrective sources (Tables 4, 5 and 6), the pH results\nshowed distinct solubility and reaction between silicates\n\nand carbonates. Therefore, physical characteristics of\ndifferent fractions may have affected the speed of reaction\nand solubilization, given that amounts of Ca and Mg oxi-\nde were applied equally in all treatments. Particle-size\nfractions smaller than 0.30 mm (ABNT &lt;50) showed higher\npH at the beginning of the incubation period and small\nvariations between correction sources, this particle size\nis thinner and showed greater surface contact with the\nsoil, increasing solubility. However, over time, larger\nparticles were soluble and modified the pH. This shows\nthat the particle size can influence reactivity, even after\nthe use of high doses. Larger fractions take a longer time\nto start neutralizing soil acidity and reach pH 5.5, compared\nto thinner particles. Longer incubation periods of larger\nparticles possibly increase pH values more than thinner\nparticles, which immediately influence soil properties, but\ndo not extend residual effects.\n\n\n\n269Determination of Reactivity Rates of Silicate Particle-size Fractions\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. (2011) studied limes of different\nparticle sizes and observed a quick increase of the lime\npH in thinner particles. This is explained because the\nreaction of corrective sources is highly affected by the\nmaterial grinding and smaller-size particles react quickly,\nhowever, the residual effect is kept for a shorter period than\nin materials with larger-size particles. Except for fractions\nbetween 2-0.84 mm (ABNT #20) in RH and TQ, calcitic and\ndolomitic limes showed similar effects on soil correction,\nwithin the same particle size fraction, regardless of the\nincubation period and soil type. Slags showed distinct\neffects depending on particle size (Tables 4, 5 and 6).\n\nThe chemical component of slags varies according to\nthe furnace type, steel grades, and pretreatment method\n(Yi et al., 2012), which may justify these differences\nbetween slags. Besides, slags are obtained through\ndistinct industrial processes, which leads to\n\nrecrystallization affected by Ca and Mg levels and cooling\ntime, influencing solubility (Pereira et al., 2010). Materials\nare submitted to different types of cooling processes that\nmay also affect slag composition, by either air or\nquenching. When slag is cooled by air, recrystallization\nof its components occurs reducing solubility when applied\nto the soil, consequently, decreasing the material reactivity\n(Prado et al., 2001).\n\nSlag 1 and both limes with particle size fractions greater\nthan 2 mm (ABNT #10) did not affect the pH in RH and\nAF. This was expected once it was not possible to\nestablish appropriate doses to increase the pH to 5.5 in\nthe previous experiment. Conversely, slags 2 and 3 that\nhad established doses to increase the pH to 5.5 did show\npositive effects in neutralizing soil acidity.\n\nThe RER was influenced by sources for soil acidity\ncorrection and varied depending on soil type (Table 7).\n\n\n\n270 Ang\u00e9lica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nHence, it is essential to study soils with distinct chemical,\nphysical, and mineralogical attributes, to estimate the RR\nof corrective sources.\n\nAlthough this study did not aim to evaluate the\ninfluence of soil type on reactivity of correction sources,\nit was observed that the effects of particle-size fractions\non acidity correction varied between soil types. Slags with\nparticles varying from 0.84-0.30 mm (ABNT #50) did not\ndiffer from each other in RH, however, they differed in TQ\nand AF. Slags 1, 2 and 3 with particle-size fractions\nbetween 2.0-0.84 mm (ABNT #20) showed similar behavior\nin AF in all incubation periods. Nevertheless, in RH, slag\n1 showed lower RER than in the other slags. These results\ncan be explained by the distinct mineralogy of the clay\nfraction in all three soil types. Pandolfo &amp; Tedesco (1996)\nreported that climate and soil conditions also influence the\nefficiency of corrective sources in neutralizing soil acidity.\n\nThe RER of silicate was higher than in carbonates,\nmainly in larger particle-size fractions, considering the\naverage from all soil types (Table 7). These results do not\ncorroborate Prado et al. (2004). The authors applied the\namounts 0.00, 5.04, and 10.08 t ha-1 for ABNT sieves #10,\n#20, #50 and&lt;50 of steel slag in an dystrophic Red Latosol\nand found RER close to the values established by Brazilian\nlegislation for lime. The same amounts for each ABNT\nsieve and the evaluation only in one soil may have\ncontributed to the differences between the results obtained\nby the authors and our results.\n\nThe RER of lime reactivity increased with smaller\nparticle-size fractions. Slag particles between 0.30-0.84\nmm and 0.84-2.0 mm showed higher RER than sizes\nsmaller than 0.30 mm.  RER in slag 3 was higher in particle\nsizes > 2.0 mm. Increasing RER of lime materials through\nreducing particle size is a consequence of lower solubility\n\n\n\n271Determination of Reactivity Rates of Silicate Particle-size Fractions\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nand faster acidity neutralization caused by enhanced\nsurface contact between the soil and the source.\nHowever, the number of pores in silicates may also have\ninfluenced the silicate effects, improving hydrolysis and\ndissolution speed. Larger particles had their size reduced\nas internal specific surface increased, therefore, soil\nacidity correction was enhanced. Studies conducted\nunder controlled conditions (Ramos et al., 2006) and in\nthe field (Corr\u00eaa et al., 2007) showed that silicate sources\nare more efficient to correct soil acidity than lime. As\nmentioned before, abundant pores and increased surface\narea of silicates increase solubility and RER. Therefore,\nproducts from the dissociation process show higher\n\nmobility in deeper soil layers (Corr\u00eaa et al., 2007, 2008,\n2009; Castro &amp; Crusciol, 2013).\n\nThe RER of particles mainly for silicates sources was\nhigher than reference values established by Brazilian\nlegislation. Particle reactivity determined in laboratory is\noften higher than under field conditions, since the\ncorrective source is mixed in the soil and moisture is kept\nat an appropriate level (Alcarde et al., 1989). Considering\nthe mean of the soils the RER of lime and wollastonite was\nsimilar to the values established by Brazilian legislation\n(Table 7). The higher RR increased ECC values in silicates\n(Table 8), reducing the doses required for acidity\ncorrection.\n\n\n\n272 Ang\u00e9lica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.\n\nRev. Ceres, Vi\u00e7osa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDolomitic and calcitic limes tend to show similar RER\nfor a given particle-size fraction whereas slags have their\nRER varying to the same particle size. Additionally, RER\nof slags used in this study are higher than the reference\nvalues established in Brazilian legislation, which shows\nthat the method used for lime should not be used for the\nslags studies. Further studies should be conducted to\nverify whether the RR obtained experimentally could be\nconsidered in the ECC calculation for soil liming and\nappropriate plant growth.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nTo FAPESP (The State of S\u00e3o Paulo Research\nFoundation), for providing scholarship and financial\nsupport for this research.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlcarde JC (1992) Corretivos da acidez do solo: Caracter\u00edsticas e\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas.
