Phosphorous \n\ncontaining probes show great potential to achieve a comprehensive \n\ncharacterization of zeolite\u2019s acidic features, via solid-state NMR. New results \n\npresented in this thesis reveal that the interaction of TMPO with Br\u00f8nsted and \n\nLewis acid sites, does not result in two distinct regions in the \n31\n\nP NMR spectra, \n\nin contrast with literature reports. 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR experiments were \n\nused for the first time in TMPO-loaded zeolites to gain more information on the \n\ninteraction of TMPO molecules with the zeolite centers. Combining 1D and 2D \n\nexperiments obtained for a group of ZSM-5 zeolites with tuned acidic \n\nproperties, provided results that refute or solve certain controversial literature \n\nassignments. Cluster-based DFT computational methods were also used to \n\ninvestigate the interaction between TMPO and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nContents \nTable of Figures........................................................................................................................... i \n\nList of Tables ............................................................................................................................. iv \n\nAcronyms .................................................................................................................................... v \n\n1.

Brief Introduction to Solid-State NMR \n\n1.1. Basic Theory \n\nSince its first reports in the mid-1940s,\n1,2\n\n nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \n\nbecame one of the most powerful and used spectroscopic tools in chemistry. Unlike \n\nsolution-state NMR, where the rapid molecular tumbling reduces the isotropic interactions \n\n(angle depending interactions) giving an easily interpretable NMR spectra, solid-state \n\nNMR (SSNMR) had less impact at the early stages, due to the complex nature of their \n\nnuclear spin Hamiltonian in the absence of molecular tumbling.\n3\n  \n\nSeveral technological and methodological developments, such as superconducting \n\nmagnets attaining higher magnetic fields, probes able to rotate at higher spinning speeds \n\nand new pulse sequences, have contributed to overcoming some of the limitations of \n\nSSNMR, yielding NMR spectra with narrower resonances. Such advances made the \n\ntechnique a powerful tool to characterize several types of materials such as polymers, \n\norganic molecules, porous materials, organometallics, pharmaceuticals, biological systems, \n\netc.\n4\n \n\nThe NMR phenomenon depends on a nucleus intrinsic property, the spin angular \n\nmomentum (I). Nuclei with I?0 are called NMR active nuclei and can be exploited to \n\ndetect NMR signal. A general rule can be used to determinate if a nucleus is NMR active, \n\nrelating the mass number and the number of neutrons (Table 1). The next topics provide an \n\noverview of nuclear interactions and some of the most common techniques used in \n\nSSNMR.\n5\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - General rule to predict spin angular moment from an isotope \n\nAtomic Mass Number of Neutrons Nuclear spin (I) \n\nEven Even 0 \n\nEven Odd Integer (1, 2, 3, etc) \n\nOdd Odd \nHalf-integer (1/2, 3/2, etc) \n\nOdd Even \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.2. SSNMR Interactions \n\nNMR interactions can be classified into two different types: external and internal \n\ninteractions. External interactions concern the interaction of one nucleus with an external \n\nmagnetic field, such as the external static magnetic field (B0) or the radiofrequency \n\nmagnetic field (B1). On the other hand, internal interactions are those pertaining the \n\nnucleus magnetic or electronic environment. These interactions can be approximated by \n\nthe following Hamiltonians.\n6\n \n\n NMR       r                       ( 1 ) \n\nWhere HNMR represent the total Hamiltonian, HZ the largest interaction, called \n\nZeeman interaction, Hrf the interaction resulting from applied radio frequency pulses, HCS \n\nthe chemical shift, HD both homo and heteronuclear dipolar couplings, HJ the J-coupling \n\nand HQ the quadrupole interaction \n\nMost of the times, the larger spin nuclear interaction is the Zeeman interaction, thus \n\nmost of the times the other interactions are considered as small perturbations to this greater \n\ninteraction. This interaction can be expressed by Equation 2, where ? is the gyromagnetic \n\nratio and Iz is the projection of the spin angular momentum along the B0 magnetic field z-\n\naxis.  \n\n   - ?I  0   ( 2 ) \n\nAll the Hamiltonian equations reported in this work are in energy units; although \n\nboth terms o  the equation should be multiplied by Planck\u2019s constant ( ), this will be \n\nomitted for the sake of simplicity. \n\nWhen a nucleus is subjected to an external magnetic field B0, a splitting of energy \n\nlevels, proportional to the magnetic field strength occurs, called Zeeman splitting. The \n\nequation that defines the energy levels for this splitting (Equation 3) can be obtained from \n\nthe previous equation, and depend on the nuclear spin magnetic quantum number mI, \n\nwhere mI= I, I-1, \u2026, -I. \n\nEm - ? mI 0   ( 3 ) \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Heteronuclear Dipolar Coupling \n\nNuclear spins produce small local magnetic fields that influence neighbor spins \n\nwith different magnitudes, depending on the internuclear distances (rIS) (Equation 4). \n\nHeteronuclear coupling corresponds to the interaction between two different nuclear spins.  \n\nThis interaction is proportional to the product of the gyromagnetic ratios of I and S spins \n\n(?I and ?S). Iz and Sz are the spin components in the z-axis of the spins I and S, whilst ? is \n\nthe angle between the external magnetic field and the internuclear vector rIS. \n\n \n\n IS -(\n \n0\n\n  \n)\n ?\n\nI\n?\nS\n\nrIS\n ( cos\n\n2?- )I S  ( 4 ) \n\n \n\n1.2.2. Homonuclear Dipolar Coupling \n\nUnlike heteronuclear coupling, that arises from an interaction between two \n\ndifferent nuclear spins, homonuclear dipolar coupling refers to an interaction between two \n\nlike spins. The Hamiltonian that describes this interaction (Equation 5), is similar to the \n\nheteronuclear interaction Hamiltonian, however, an additional term is added referring to \n\n\u201c lip- lop\u201d interaction, meaning that the system can now exchange magneti ation through \n\nenergy conserving \u201c lip- lop\u201d transitions. \n\n \n\n II -(\n \n0\n\n  \n)\n ?\n\nI\n?\nS\n\nr\nIS\n \n( cos2?- )(2I  I2 -\n\n \n\n2\n(I \n\n \nI\n2\n\n-\n I\n\n \n\n-\nI2\n ) ) ( 5 ) \n\nThe term I\n+\n re ers to an operator that  lips a spin  rom the \u201cdown\u201d to the \u201cup\u201d \n\norientation, and I\n- \n\nrefers to the opposite effect. It is important to underline that this \n\ninteraction only occurs for like spins with similar resonance frequencies. \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Chemical-Shift Anisotropy \n\nWhen a molecule is exposed to an external magnetic field B0, both the nuclei and \n\nthe electrons interact with the external field. The interaction of B0 with surrounding \n\nelectrons induces small local magnetic fields, that influence the effective magnetic field \n\nfelt by the nucleus. Thus, the chemical shift can be understood as an interaction between \n\nthe nucleus and the external, mediated by the surrounding electrons.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nGenerally, molecules possess non-spherical electronic distribution, thus the \n\ninteraction between B0 and the nucleus, mediated by the non-spherical electronic cloud, \n\nbecome dependent on the orientation (anisotropic). This interaction has no visible effect on \n\nliquid state NMR because the randomly and rapid molecular tumbling eliminates the \n\ninteraction. Chemical shift Hamiltonian (Hcs) is divided in two parts (Equation 6), one \n\nisotropic term and one anisotropic term (orientation dependent), where ?iso is the isotropic \n\nchemical shi t and ?CSA is the anisotropic chemical shift. \n\n \n\n  S  ?I  0 ?iso \n \n\n2\n ? S ( cos\n\n2?- )    ( 6 ) \n\n \n\n1.2.4. Quadrupolar Interaction \n\nThe interactions discussed above focused on spin-\u00bd nuclei (I = \u00bd), however, most \n\nof the NMR active isotopes have nuclear spins higher than \u00bd, with 2nI+1 spin states, called \n\nquadrupolar nuclei. The nuclear spin from these nuclei can be both integer (I = 1, 2, \u2026) or \n\nhalf-integer (I    /2, 5/2, \u2026), thus have more spin states more and a larger number of \n\npossible transitions. Quadrupolar nuclei have a unique nuclear spin interaction, called \n\nquadrupolar interaction, that often has a much larger magnitude compared to the other \n\ninteractions.\n7\n \n\nQuadrupolar nuclei have a non-spherical charge distribution, which creates an \n\nelectric quadrupole moment (Q) that interacts with the local electric-field gradient, which \n\ngives rise to quadrupolar interaction. The Hamiltonian that describes this interaction is \n\nquite complex, so a general approach considers only two orientation dependent terms, \n\ncalled first- and second-order quadrupole interactions. While the former, can be suppressed \n\nusing magic-angle spinning (MAS), the latter can not be completely suppressed with this \n\ntechnique (discussed the topic 1.3.1) and therefore advanced techniques such double \n\nrotation (DOR), dynamic magic angle spinning (DAS) or multiple-quantum MAS \n\n(MQMAS) are required to obtain high-resolution spectra with quadrupolar nuclei. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n1.3. Solid-State NMR Techniques \n\n1.3.1. Magic-Angle Spinning \n\nMagic-angle spinning (MAS) technique consists in rotating the sample holder \n\nseveral kHz around an angle ?M = 54.736\u00ba with the external magnetic field at which the \n\nHamiltonian orientation depend term (3cos\n2 \n?\u20131), present on hetero and homonuclear \n\ndipolar coupling, 1\nst\n order quadrupole coupling and CSA, averages to zero. This method \n\ntries to mimic the effect of rapid and isotropic molecular tumbling, observed in solution  \n\nNMR, giving sharper peaks. At sufficiently low MAS rates the signal produces a manifold \n\nof spinning sidebands separated by integer multiples of the spinning speed fr equency, \n\ncreating an envelope resembling the static line shape. The discovery of MAS contributed to \n\nextreme line narrowing of resonances, giving rise to high-resolution SSNMR spectra, \n\nespecially in \u00bd spins.\n7\n \n\n \n\n1.3.2. Decoupling Techniques \n\nBoth hetero and homonuclear dipolar interactions contribute to peak broadening in \n\nSSNMR spectroscopy, sometimes resulting in uninterpretable NMR spectra. Continuous-\n\nwave (CW) heteronuclear decoupling was been widely used in I-S spin systems,\n8\n where a \n\nradio frequency field irradiates the nuclei with the higher gyromagnetic ratio, thus \n\nremoving the heteronuclear coupling between the I and S spins. In this technique, the \n\ndecoupling efficiency is in general proportional to the irradiation power amplitude. Even \n\nthough, the heteronuclear dipolar coupling can be removed using the CW approach, more \n\nsophisticated and efficient methods have been developed, such two-pulse phase \n\nmodulation (TPPM)\n9\n and small phase incremental alternation (SPINAL-n)\n\n10\n. \n\nHomonuclear decoupling of nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratio can be obtained \n\nwith MAS, however solid-state samples presenting strong homonuclear dipolar couplings \n\nbetween like spins I-I with the high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. \n1\nH) need a different approach. \n\nThese stronger interactions require more elaborated homonuclear decoupling techniques \n\ncombining rotation and multipulse sequences (CRAMPS),\n11\n\n such as WAHUHA\n12\n\n or Lee-\n\nGoldburg\n13\n\n based methods. Technological advances allowed ultra-fast MAS rates (ca. 100 \n\nkHz) that increase greatly the spectral resolution, e.g. in \n1\nH MAS NMR.\n\n14,15\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.3.3. Cross Polarization \n\nSince its first reports, cross polarization (CP) technique became one of the most \n\nimportant techniques in SSNMR.\n16\n\n Most of the times this double resonance technique is \n\nused to enhance the sensitivity of a diluted nucleus (S) by transferring polarization from an \n\nabundant spin (I), however, CP can be also used to transfer magnetization between two \n\nabundant spins, e.g. from \n1\nH to \n\n31\nP. Most of the S spins that suffer from low sensitivity, \n\nalso have a low gyromagnetic ratio and a long spin-lattice relaxation time, which results in \n\ntime-consuming SSNMR experiments.  Using CP technique, the spectrum can be obtained \n\nwith a considerably shorter experimental time mainly due to two combining advantages: \n\nthe sensitivity enhancement of S spins (e.g., \n13\n\nC,\n29\n\nSi) and the shorter spin-lattice relaxation \n\ntime from I spins (e.g., \n1\nH), resulting in spectra with lower signal to noise ratio even with \n\nless acquisition time (Figure 1). Information about the proximity between the I and S spins \n\ncan be obtained from the CPMAS spectrum. In these experiments the magnetization is \n\ntransferred through space, S spins near abundant spins are easily polarized, while those \n\nfurthest require longer contact periods to be polarized.\n7\n For this reason, no information \n\nabout the stoichiometry of a system can be readily obtained from the intensity of the \n\nsignals, as shown in Figure 1A where the most intense peak in the single pulse experiment \n\nbecomes one of the less intense peaks in the CPMAS experiment. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Comparison of CP and single pulse experiments; a) \n31\n\nP CPMAS and \n31\n\nP spectra, b) \n\n29\nSi and \n\n29\nSi spectra of HZSM-5 zeolite loaded with TMPO. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nFigure 2 illustrates a pulse sequence that can be used in a typical CP experiment, \n\nwith an abundant spin I, trans erring its magneti ation to the diluted spin S. First, a  /2 \n\npulse is applied at the I channel to bring magnetization to the xy plane. Second, a radio-\n\nfrequency irradiation is applied simultaneously to both spins over a period, ?cp, where the \n\nmagnetization is transferred from the abundant to the diluted spin. Then the signal of S \n\nspin is acquired, while the I spin is subject to heteronuclear decoupling irradiation.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Schematic representation of a typical CP pulse sequence in a I-S spin system. \n\n \n\n1.3.4. Two-Dimensional NMR Spectroscopy \n\nTwo dimensional (2D) experiments can give new information that helps overcome \n\nsome difficulties or doubts from the analysis of 1D spectra, allowing the increase of \n\nspectral resolution due to the correlation in the indirect dimension. Although there are \n\nseveral 2D experiments in both liquid and solid-state NMR, the basic procedure is the \n\nsame for all these experiments. Figure 3 shows a typical 2D experiment where four time \n\nperiods can be distinguished. In this work 2D CP-Heterocorrelation (CP-HETCOR) \n\nexperiments where used (Section 3.2.1.3), where the first period (Preparation; tp) is a ?/2 \n\npulse followed by a second period (Evolution; t1), where the magnetization can evolve for \n\na period t1 under a specify Hamiltonian, for example under a homonuclear spin \n\ndecoupling Hamiltonian. The 2D experiment result from a combination of several 1D \n\nexperiments where the t1 period is increased (Figure 3). The third period (Mixing, tm), \n\ndepending on the experiment can also be a single or a group of pulses that convert \n\ncoherence into observable magnetization for the last period (Detection; t 2), in this work \n\nthe tm period is a spinlock block where the magnetization is transferred from I to S spins. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nIn the last period each t1 increment is detected separately, resulting in time-dependent \n\nsignal S(t1,t2).\n17\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Schematic representation of the typical four periods in 2D NMR experiments: \n\npreparation (tp), evolution (t1), mixing (tm) and detection (t2) \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n2. Zeolites Acidity \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nAluminosilicate zeolites are microporous materials with a three-dimensional \n\nframework structure and a well-defined channels and pores. These molecular sized pores \n\nand channels are one of the most differentiating features in zeolites, allowing them to act as \n\nmolecular sieves, adsorbing molecules smaller than the fitting size and excluding \n\nmolecules with larger dimensions. The shape and size of the pores and channels are \n\ncharacteristic of each zeolite, for example, the Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) has 10-\n\nmembered pores (used in this work) while the zeolite Y has a 12-membered ring (number \n\nof oxygens). \n\nAmong a large variety of applications,\n18\u201320\n\n zeolites had a large impact on \n\npetrochemical industries due to their acidic characteristics. Most of the studies concerning \n\nzeolites properties focus on the acidic properties of these materials. Generally, zeolites \n\nhave two types of acid sites (Figure 4), Br\u00f8nsted (proton donors) and Lewis (electron pair \n\nacceptors) acid sites.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Representation of different types of acid sites. a) terminal silanol hydroxyls, b) \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites (bridging hydroxyls); c) Lewis acid sites. \n\nFigure 4 shows the most common sites that can be found in a zeolitic structure. \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acidity arises from bridging hydroxyl groups (Figure 4b) and from terminal \n\nhydroxyls groups (silanol; Si-OH) (Figure 4a), since the latter are very weak Br\u00f8nsted \n\nsites, some authors refer to these as non-acidic groups. The formation of Lewis acid sites \n\noccurs in the dealumination process and is associated with defects in the framework, also \n\ncalled extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species (Figure 4c). The dealumination \n\ntreatment usually removes framework aluminum atoms with thermal dehydroxylation \n\nforming silanol nests and EFAL species with different structures, e.g., AlO\n+\n, Al(OH)2\n\n+\n, \n\nAlOH\n2+\n\n, AlOOH and Al(OH)3.\n21,22\n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe formation of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites occurs when a silicon atom is replaced with a \n\ntrivalent aluminum, in a framework containing only tetrahedral SiO4 units (Figure 4) \n\nbounded by corner-sharing oxygens. When the Si atom is replaced with a trivalent \n\naluminum, the framework becomes negatively charged and a cation (e.g. H\n+\n, Na\n\n+\n, K\n\n+\n) is \n\nneeded to balance the structure. In their protonated form, zeolites belong to a class of \n\nmaterials called solid acid catalysts.\n23\n\n These solid-state catalysts appear as an alternative to \n\nthe highly toxic and corrosive liquid acid catalysts, such H2SO4 and HF, used as \n\nhomogeneous catalysts in petrochemical industry.\n24\n\n  \n\nThe performance of solid-state acid catalysts depends on their acidic features \n\nnamely, the acid type (Br\u00f8nsted or Lewis), acidic strength, distribution, accessibility and \n\namount of acid sites. Therefore, a complete understanding of these properties is needed to \n\ndesign highly efficient solid acid catalysts. Although there is a variety of techniques \n\ncapable of characterizing the acidity of this type of materials, solid-state NMR is the most \n\nversatile technique as it may, for instance, probe the local defects (catalytic sites) of \n\nzeolitic structures.\n25,26\n\n  \n\n \n\n2.2. Acidity characterization using Framework Nuclei \n\nOver the past decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts for hydrocarbons \n\ntransformations, as an alternative to the more toxic and corrosive liquid acid catalysts.\n27,28\n\n \n\nAlthough is well accepted that zeolites act as catalysts in cracking processes, the \n\nmechanism and involvement of the acid sites still present many challenges to overcome.  \n\nZeolites acidity can be characterized by a variety of analytical and spectroscopic \n\ntechniques such microcalorimetry, temperature programmed desorption (TPD),\n29,30\n\n Fourier \n\ntransform infrared (IR),\n31,32\n\n and NMR. Although most of these techniques are well \n\ndescribed in the literature and can obtain accurate information about the amount, strength \n\nand type of acid site, other important features such as distribution and location of acid sites \n\ncan be efficiently probed by SSNMR spectroscopy. \n\nA variety of SSNMR techniques have been applied and developed to study zeolites \n\nacidity, reflecting the great interest in this topic. The evaluation of zeolitic acidity through \n\nSSNMR can be made by direct observation of nuclei involved in the acidic groups, such \n\n1\nH, \n\n29\nSi or \n\n27\nAl or through the observation of adsorbed basic probes such as acetone,\n\n33\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\npyridine\n34,35\n\n and phosphorous-containing probes.\n36\u201338\n\n In the next sections, the pros and \n\ncons of these methods will be briefly reviewed. \n\n \n\n2.2.1. \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nThe simplest approach to investigates zeolite acidity is to look directly into the \n\nacidic protons, using \n1\nH MAS NMR. Unlike other zeolites nuclei (e.g., \n\n29\nSi, \n\n27\nAl, \n\n17\nO), \n\n1\nH \n\n(I=1/2) is a nucleus with a high gyromagnetic ratio and almost a 100% natural abundance, \n\nthus reflecting a high sensitivity. Unfortunately, \n1\nH NMR has a narrow chemical shift \n\nrange (?? ~ 20 ppm), which compromises the spectral resolution when compared to other \n\nspin-1/2 nuclei such as \n13\n  (?? ~ 250 ppm) or \n\n31\nP (?? ~ 650 ppm).\n\n24\n  \n\nAs shown in Figure 5, some typical groups can be identified in the \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nspectra of H-form zeolites. \n1\nH NMR resonances at lower chemical shifts are usually \n\nassigned to non-acidic hydroxyls groups (?H: 1.5-2.0 ppm), on the other hand, acidic \n\nprotons have higher \n1\nH resonances (?H: 3.6-5.6 ppm). Other minor peaks can also appear, \n\nfor example, disturbed acid sites usually appear at higher chemical shifts (?H > 6 ppm) and \n\narise from acidic groups that participate in hydrogen bonds with neighbor oxygens. The \n1\nH \n\nMAS NMR spectra of dealuminated zeolites might also show resonance associated with \n\nLewis acid sites (?H: 2.4-3.6 ppm).\n39\u201341\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Schematic representation of some typical groups in H-form zeolites; (blue) bridging \n\nhydroxyl, (green) silanol and (red) disturbed bridging hydroxyl group. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nIn NMR spectroscopy, the surrounding environment has a large influence on \n\nexperimental parameters. Generally, low field peaks (higher chemical shifts) are associated \n\nwith stronger acids, however, the interaction of acidic protons with neighbor oxygens, in \n\nsmall pores, lead to higher chemical shifts than those in larger cages.\n42\n\n For instance, the \n1\nH \n\nMAS NMR spectrum of the HY zeolite shows two peaks appearing at 4.2 and 5.2 ppm, \n\nassigned to bridging hydroxyls in super (larger) cages and sodalite (smaller) cages, \n\nrespectively.\n40,41\n\n \n\nAlthough this approach is suitable for obtaining preliminary information and a \n\nwell-resolved spectrum with a short acquisition time, detailed information about the acid \n\nsites features such acid type, strength and distribution are precluded by the poor spectral \n\nresolution offered by \n1\nH MAS NMR spectra. In this work 2D \n\n1\nH-X CP-HETCOR (X = \n\n29\nSi \n\nor \n31\n\nP) experiments are used to distinguish acidic environments ( sections 4.1.1 and \n\n4.1.4.1). \n\n \n\n2.2.2. \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR \n\nSilicon is one of the most abundant elements in zeolites and it is involved in \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acid groups structure, however, the \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra of zeolites give no \n\nrelevant information about the acidic features. Despite this, the \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra are \n\nusually used to estimate the Si/Al ratio,\n43\n\n that has an inverse relationship to the amount of \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites in the framework. \n\nThe zeolite framework is composed of TO4 groups, where T= Si or Al, connected \n\nvia corner sharing. Silicon atoms are usually labeled according to the number of \n\nsurrounding aluminum atoms Si(nAl), where n = 0, 1, 2,3 or 4 and refers the number of \n\naluminum atoms surrounding the SiO4 groups. The \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra of zeolites \n\npresent peaks between -75 and -125 ppm, corresponding to the different Si(nAl) groups.\n44\n\n \n\nThe \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectrum can be used to estimate the Si/Al ratio, using the peaks \n\nintensities (Equation 7), where ISi(nAl) is the peak intensity for the Si(nAl) atom,\n45\n\n this \n\nequation only applies to materials with Si/Al ratios lower than 10.\n46\n\n \n\nSi\n\n l\n  \n\n?

The NMR active aluminum isotope \n\n(\n27\n\nAl), is a half-integer quadrupolar nucleus (I = 5/2) with 100% natural abundance.  \n\nFramework aluminum atoms are tetra-coordinated (AlO4\n-\n) and as proven by \n\nLoewenstein, tetrahedral aluminum can not be connected to other tetrahedral aluminum via \n\nAl-O-Al bonds.\n47\n\n Usually, the spectrum of zeolites without EFAL has one or more peaks \n\nbetween 50-65 ppm, assigned to framework tetrahedral aluminum species. Extra-\n\nframework aluminum species appear at lower chemical shifts, depending on their structure; \n\noctahedral species appear around 0 and 10 ppm and distorted four-coordinated and five-\n\ncoordinated species around 30 and 50 ppm.\n44,48\n\n Figure 6 shows the \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR \n\nspectrum of a hydrated HZSM-5 zeolites dealuminated using strong acidic conditions, that \n\ncan remove some of the framework species, forming EFAL species. The spectrum shows \n\nboth tetrahedral (FAL) and octahedral (EFAL) aluminum species. \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR spectrum from a dealuminated HZSM-5 zeolite with Si/Al ratio ca. \n\n20 (sample MFI64 see experimental chapter) obtained at a B0 field of 16.4 T, showing both \n\nFAL and EFAL species. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nUnder MAS, the second-order quadrupolar interaction is only partially averaged \n\nout, in some cases, severe line broadening of the \n27\n\nAl central transition may generate the \n\nso-called \u201cinvisible aluminum\u201d species.\n49\n\n This is often the case of EFAL sites with less \n\nsymmetric geometries showing a much larger quadrupolar interaction.\n50,51\n\n In hydrated \n\nzeolites the water molecules can coordinate to EFAL species, forming more stable species \n\nwith increased symmetry that leads to a decrease of quadrupolar interaction and hence to a \n\ndecrease in \u201cinvisible aluminum\u201d species. Yu and coworkers used two-dimensional (2D) \n\ndouble-quantum single-quantum (DQ-SQ) MAS techniques to investigate the formation of \n\nextra framework species in an HY zeolite upon calcination at different temperatures, 500, \n\n600 and 700 \u00baC.\n52\n\n In this study, the authors concluded that calcination at 500 \u00baC yields \n\nspecies around 0 ppm (octahedral Al), other species, i.e., distorted four and five-\n\ncoordinated, are formed only at higher temperatures.\n52\n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Acidity Characterization using Probe Molecules \n\nEven though some information can be obtained using a direct observation of the \n\nacidic groups, over the past few years the use of different molecular probes showed \n\npromising results to obtain a better characterization of the acidic features in zeolites. In \n\norder to find a suitable molecular probe, it is required that the probe has basic properties \n\nand interact with zeolite acid sites forming acid-base pairs. This interaction can provide \n\nadditional information into the nature of acid sites, that is almost impossible to obtain with \n\nthe direct observation of the acid sites using SSNMR.   \n\nOver the past few year, several probes molecules have been used to overcome the \n\nlimited spectral resolution from \n1\nH MAS NMR and the explore the acidic features of \n\ndifferent zeolites.\n42\n\n Several studies used \n13\n\nC-labeled acetone to investigate the \n13\n\nC MAS \n\nNMR spectra of acetone-loaded zeolites.\n33,53\n\n Unfortunately, these \n13\n\nC NMR experiments \n\nrequire \n13\n\nC isotopic enrichment to obtain one spectrum in a reasonable time. Other studies \n\nused amines as probe molecules, such as ammonia, n-butylamine, pyridine and \n\nmethylamine.\n42,54\n\n Nitrogen has two NMR active nuclei, however, both of them have some \n\ndisadvantages, \n14\n\nN is a quadrupolar nucleus (I=1) and \n15\n\nN (I=1/2) has a very low natural \n\nabundance (0.4 %).\n34,55\n\n \n\nPhosphorous containing probes appeared as an alternative to the above-mentioned \n\nmolecules. These probes were successfully used to obtain information about the acid type \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nand strength and, when combined with elemental analysis data, information about the \n\nconcentration and distribution can be easily obtained.\n24,56\n\n  \n\nTable 2, present the pros and cons from the above-mentioned probes to access a \n\nspecific feature from an acid site. Even though each of these probing nuclei has inherent \n\nadvantages and disadvantages, it seems that \n31\n\nP MAS NMR is the better approach to \n\ninvestigate zeolites acidity, thus will be discussed in more detail in the next in the next \n\nsection. \n\n \n\nTable 2 -  Comparison of different SSNMR experiments used in zeolites acidity \n\ncharacterization. \n\nMethod Probe \n\n \n\nAcid Type \nAcid \n\ndistribution \n\n Acid \n\nconcentration \n\nAcid \n\nstrength \nBr\u00f8nsted Lewis  \n\n1\nH NMR pyridine \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n13\n\nC NMR acetone \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n31\nP NMR \n\nTMP \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(B) \n \n\n \n\n(L) \n\n \n\n \n\nR3PO \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(B) \n  \n\n(L) \n  \n\n \n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n2.3.1. Phosphorous containing probes \n\nPhosphorous active NMR isotope (\n31\n\nP) has 100% natural abundance (\n31\n\nP, I=1/2), a \n\nbroad chemical shift range (?? > 650 ppm)\n42\n\n and a large gyromagnetic ratio. The intrinsic \n\nproperties from \n31\n\nP make these probes more desirable than those using that use \n13\n\nC and \n15\n\nN \n\nNMR.\n54\n\n Two main types of phosphorous containing probes have been used to investigate \n\nzeolites acidity (Figure 7), trimethylphosphine (TMP) and trialkylphosphine oxides \n\n(R3PO), being trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) the most extensively used, among R3POs \n\nprobes, to investigate not only in zeolites but in solid acids in general.\n26\n\n   \n\nLegend:       good,        bad,       fair, (B) Br\u00f8nsted, (L) Lewis, TMP \u2013 trimethylphosphine, \nR3PO trialkylphosphine oxide \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Molecular structure of a) trimethylphosphine and b) trialkylphosphine oxides, where \n\nR represent an alkyl chain that can have different sizes and shapes. \n\nDifferent complexes are formed depending on the type of interaction between \n\nTMP/TMPO and the acid site (Figure 8),\n57\n\n that can easily lead to the identification of the \n\nacid type and strength. The interaction of TMP molecules with Lewis acid sites gives rise \n\nto a broad chemical shift range, between -20 and -60 ppm, thus allowing the determination \n\nof the relative acidic strength for Lewis acid sites. On the other hand, when adsorbed onto \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acid sites (Figure 8B), TMP forms protonated complexes (TMPH\n+\n) that have a \n\nnarrow chemical shift range, between -2 and -5 ppm, making the identification of Br\u00f8nsted \n\nacid strength quite difficult.\n24\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Representation of the interaction between phosphorous-containing probes and acid \n\nsites a) physisorbed at Br\u00f8nsted acid site, b) chemisorbed at Br\u00f8nsted acid site and c) \n\nchemisorbed at Lewis acid site. \n\nAlthough TMP allows an easy identification of the acid type and can distinguish \n\nbetween subtle differences in the Lewis acid strength, R3PO probes can differentiate \n\nbetween Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites and also obtain information about the Br\u00f8nsted \n\nacidity strength and the distribution of these acid sites.\n42\n\n In addition, TMP molecules are \n\noxidized when exposed to air, making the sample preparation more difficult.\n58\n\n For these \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nreasons, the following discussion focus on the use of R3PO as probes, more specifically in \n\nthe use of TMPO. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.1. Identification of Acid Types \n\nIn the literature is mentioned that TMPO-loaded zeolites have two distinct regions \n\nin the \n31\n\nP MAS NMR spectrum that can be assigned to the interaction of TMPO either with \n\nLewis (ca. 50 ppm) or Br\u00f8nsted (above 55 ppm) acid sites.\n59\n\n Most of the times, the \n\nidentification of the acid type using TMPO, or other R3PO probes, require sample \n\nmanipulation and two different experiments. The interaction of TMPO with Br\u00f8nsted acid \n\nsites, via strong hydrogen bonds, forms TMPOH\n+\n complexes that spread along the \n\n31\nP \n\nNMR spectra according to the acid site strength. On the other hand, the weaker interaction \n\nbetween TMPO and the Lewis acid sites can be easily dissociated when exposed to air \n\nhumidity,\n60\n\n where the TMPO molecules are replaced with one water molecules, forming \n\nweak Br\u00f8nsted acid sites.\n42\n\n Therefore, peaks related to Lewis acid sites tend to decrease in \n\nintensity after the sample being exposed to air humidity (Figure 9), thus allowing the \n\nidentification of acid types. \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - \n31\n\nP MAS NMR spectra of a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5 zeolite, before (red) and after \n\n(blue) being exposed to air humidity. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nEven though this method allows the differentiation between Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted \n\nacid sites, new methods that do not require sample manipulation are preferred. Huang et at. \n\nused a Lee-Goldburg Cross-polarization (LG-CP) experiment combined with a selective \n\npulse targeted to non-acidic protons to remove their effect on CP.\n61\n\n With this experiment \n\nthe authors achieved a selective detection of the desired acid sites in an HY zeolite loaded \n\nwith TMPO. The use of more advanced SSNMR techniques, for example, 2D experiments, \n\nshow a great potential to investigate acidic properties in these systems. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.2. Investigate Acidic Strength \n\nPhosphine oxide molecules, which have a hydrogen bond acceptor (oxygen), can \n\ninteract with the acidic groups, forming different TMPOH\n+\n complexes. Slight variations in \n\nthis complexes result in electron density changes around the phosphorous nucleus, thus \n\nshifting the peaks in the \n31\n\nP spectrum.\n62,63\n\n Stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites give rise to stronger \n\nhydrogens bond in these complexes and usually yield resonances at higher \n31\n\nP chemical \n\nshifts.\n38\n\n A theoretical study confirmed the correlation between the interaction of TMPO \n\nwith stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and the \n31\n\nP resonances at higher chemical shifts,\n64\n\n \n\nsuggesting a linear correlation between the \n31\n\nP isotropic chemical shift and the acidic \n\nstrength. In solid acids, the deprotonation energy (DPE) and proton affinity (PA), are \n\nwidely used as a measure of the acid strength. \n\n \n\n?P   2. 666( 5.   )-0.  02( 0.020) P   ( 8 ) \n\nIn contrast to what happens with Br\u00f8nsted acid sites,  TMP is superior to TMPO for \n\ndeterminating Lewis acid strength.\n24\n\n To the best of my knowledge, there is no study in \n\nzeolites, that correlate the probe chemical shift to the Lewis acid site strength. However, a \n\ntheoretical study was able to correlate the Lewis acidic strength to the probe chemical shift, \n\nin Lewis acid sites models with different metal atoms.\n57\n\n This study presents a linear \n\ncorrelation between the \n31\n\nP chemical shift and the binding energy (BE) of TMP complexes \n\nwith different Lewis acids. Qualitative information about the Lewis acidic strength can be \n\nobtained from this correlation, higher BEs values correspond to stronger Lewis acid site, \n\nhence a higher \n31\n\nP chemical shift. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n2.3.1.3. Investigate Distribution of Acid Sites \n\nSeveral studies showed that quantitative information about the distribution and \n\nconcentration of acid sites can be obtained by choosing the proper R3PO probe \n\nmolecule.\n63,65\n\n Zhao et al. used TMPO and TBPO to investigate the distribution of acid \n\nsites.\n63\n\n The smaller kinetic diameter (KD) of TMPO (0.55 nm), that is comparable to the \n\nsize of a 10-membered ring of a ZSM-5 zeolite, and therefore it is capable to access inside \n\nthese pores.\n42\n\n On the other hand, TBPO has a larger KD (0.82 nm), so it is not capable to \n\npenetrate in the 10-membered ring and access the smaller channels. Since TBPO is too \n\nbulky to enter the 10-member rings of ZSM-5, the molecules can only interact with \n\nexternal acid sites, whereas the smaller TMPO molecules can interact both with the \n\nexternal and internal acid sites. Hence, information about the location of the zeolite sites \n\ncan be readily accessible using this approach. \n\nA typical spectrum from a TMPO-loaded ZSM-5 shows five peaks at 86, 75, 67, 63 \n\nand 53 ppm associated to Br\u00f8nsted acid sites with different acid strengths.\n38,63\n\n On the other \n\nhand, the \n31\n\nP NMR spectrum from TBPO adsorbed on an HZSM-5 shows only three \n\nresonance peaks associated with Br\u00f8nsted acidity, at 92, 75 and 71 ppm.\n63\n\n One downside \n\nof this approach is that TBPO and TMPO show resonances at different chemical shifts for \n\nthe interaction in the same acid site. This offset reflects differences in the strength of the \n\nhydrogen bond between the acidic hydrogen and the probe oxygen.\n24\n\n Wiper et at. \n\nsuggested an alternative using only TMPO to probe external and internal acid site.\n60\n\n In this \n\napproach an as-synthesized zeolite (before being calcinated), that has the internal surface \n\noccupied with template molecules is loaded with TMPO, leaving only the external sites \n\naccessible to TMPO adsorption. \n\nAnother crucial acid site feature, that can have a large influence on the catalytic \n\nperformance, is the distance between acid sites. Grey et al used diphenyldiphosphines \n\n(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2 (n = 1, 3 and 6) as probes to investigate the distance between acid sites, \n\nusing 2D double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR.\n66\n\n Using this approach the \n\nauthors were able to probe the proximity of several acid sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n2.4. Acidity characterization using Computational Methods \n\nNowadays, modelling methods are well established and are an essential tool for \n\nresearchers in the study of different types of compounds, materials, reactions and \n\nspectroscopy. Combining computational and experimental results can be quite useful in the \n\nstudy of materials with complex structures and properties. Several computational studies \n\nabout the structure, properties and reactions of zeolites using molecular mechanics and \n\ndynamics have been done in the past. However, the evolution of computational resources \n\nand efficiency allowed the use of methods with heavier demands on computer power, such \n\nas ab initio and semi-empirical calculations.\n67\u201370\n\n \n\nQuantum mechanics calculations should arise from the result of Schr\u00f6dinger \n\nequation; however, no analytical result has been accepted as a solution of this equation for \n\na many-electrons system. Since most of the systems used in quantum chemistry \n\ncalculations are multi-electrons systems, some approximations to obtain a result from \n\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation are required. Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation,\n71,72\n\n assumes that \n\nmany-electrons systems can be represented as a determinant from the single-electron \n\nwavefunction from each electron. This approximation, look at electrons as individual \n\nidentities, ignoring the interaction between electrons, which may result in significant \n\nerrors. Post-HF methods such as M\u00f8ller-Plesset (e.g. MP2 and MP4),\n73,74\n\n are used to \n\novercome some limitations from HF calculation. These methods have some corrections to \n\nHF model, usually introducing electron-electron interactions, that lead to very time \n\nexpensive calculations. \n\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) methods were developed to overcome some \n\nlimitations of HF method and minimize the computational demand from post-HF methods. \n\nUnlike wavefunction-based methods where the system representation depends on three \n\nspatial variables for each electron, DFT calculations take a simpler approach by replacing \n\nthe system wavefunction with an electronic density distribution.\n75\n\n Besides being able to \n\ndecrease the computational demand, this modification can also indirectly introduce \n\nelectron correlations, ignored in simpler approaches. \n\nA common approach to modulate zeolites acidity uses clusters that mimic a \n\nBronsted acid site, instead of using all the zeolite structure.\n76\u201378\n\n Although some properties \n\nfrom the zeolite can be better estimated using periodic boundary calculations (PBC), for \n\nlocal properties, such as the zeolite acidity, it is convenient to use the cluster approach, \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nwhich can simplify the calculations. In general, it is required a model with at least 8 \n\ntetrahedral (8T) units to obtain an accurate description of the acidic site.\n79\n\n Figure 10 shows \n\none 8T and one 49T model that can be used to investigate properties from HZSM-5. Most \n\nof the times, these models are extracted from crystallographic structures and to preserve \n\nthe structure, that largely influences the properties of the material, the terminal atoms are \n\nfixed along their crystallographic direction, preserving structural integrity. The cluster \n\napproach has been successfully applied to investigate the interaction between probe \n\nmolecules and the acid sites.\n80\u201383\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Two examples of HZSM-5 model clusters that can be used for investigating \n\nzeolites acidity and other properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n3. Materials and Methods \n\n3.1. Materials \n\n3.1.1. Zeolites Preparation \n\nZSM-5 was synthesized hydrothermally. Sodium aluminate was used as Al source, \n\nwhile TEOS or Ludox HS-30 were used as silicon source. Tetrapropyl-ammonium (TPA\n+\n) \n\nor n-butylamine (BTA) were used as templates. ZSM-5 samples were done as follow. 0.10 \n\ng of sodium aluminate (54 m/m % Al2O3, 41 m/m % Na2O), 0.68 g of NaF and 0.68 g of \n\ntetrapropylamine bromide (TPABr, 98 wt%, Aldrich) were dissolved in 16.87 mL of H2O. \n\nThen 3.13 g of tetrapropylamine hydroxide solution (1 M TPAOH in H2O, Aldrich) was \n\nadded to above solution. Finally, the mixture of 6.47 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (98 wt%, \n\nAldrich) and 5.62 g of ethanol was added. The resulting precursor was agitated in a \n\ncovered container for 4 hours and then treated at 180\u00baC for 3 days without agitation. The \n\nBTA-ZSM-5 was done as follow. 0.25 g of sodium aluminate and 0.75 g of NaOH were \n\ndissolved in 63.5 mL of H2O. Then 19.80 g of Ludox HS-30 (30 wt% SiO2) was added to \n\nabove solution with agitation. After 15 minutes, 2.94 g of n-butylamine (BTA) was added. \n\nThe resulting precursor was agitated for 60 minutes and then treated at 180\u00baC for 4 days \n\nwithout agitation.  \n\nThe removal of the organic template was carried out at 550\u00baC 8 h for TPA\n+\n samples \n\n(MFI8 and MFI20), or 700\u00baC 2 h for BTA sample (MFI64). Ion exchange was carried out \n\nat ambient temperature. The pre-calcined samples were mixed with 0.17 M (NH4)2SO4 \n\nsolution (solution to solid ratio is ca. 40) for proper time, after washing and drying, the \n\nresulting powder was calcined at 350\u00baC for 5 h to get H-form products. NH4ZSM-5 and \n\nNaZSM-5 were prepared by dispersing 0.19 g of calcined ZSM-5 into 10 mL H2O with \n\n0.11 g of (NH4)2SO4 (or 0.24 g of Na2SO4) at ambient temperature. The Si/Al ratios of all \n\nstudied samples range from 19 to 20, these ratios were obtained using Inductively Coupled \n\nPlasma (ICP) prior to the NMR analysis. All the samples used in this thesis were \n\nsynthesized by Dr. Zhi Lin. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Information about the nomenclature, acidic properties and synthesis template from \n\nthe ZSM-5 samples used in this work; NP \u2013 samples synthesized without template. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Zeolites Dehydration \n\nAround 3,5 g of a zeolite sample was placed in a quartz Schlenk and heated in a \n\ntubular hoven to 380 \u00b0C for 3 hours at a rate of 1 \u00b0C per minute under vacuum. After \n\ncooling down the sample to room temperature the Schlenk tube was sealed and transferred \n\nimmediately to an Ar glove box. The sample was then packed into a MAS rotor and stored \n\nin the Ar box until needed to the NMR experiments. \n\n1\nH MAS NMR experiments require fully dehydrated samples, for this experiment \n\nthe unloaded samples were placed inside an in-situ MAS rotor loading apparatus (Figure \n\n11) and degassed in a vacuum line at 10\n-2\n\n Pa and 300 \u00b0C for 6 hours. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Experimental apparatus used to fully dihydrate the unloaded ZSM-5 samples used \n\nin \n1\nH MAS NMR experiments.

TMPO Adsorption \n\nTMPO is often dissolved in a solvent (e.g CH2Cl2) and then adsorbed into the \n\nmaterials. However, this procedure can lead to the adsorption of solvent molecules and a \n\ngas phase adsorption protocol was adapted (Figure 12).\n84\n\n In a typical procedure, 0.3 g of \n\nTMPO were weighed and transferred to a quartz Schlenk, inside an Ar glove box. After \n\nbeing completely sealed the Schlenk is placed in a vacuum line and the samples are dried \n\nfor 2 hours at room temperature. A dried zeolite sample was placed under N2 atmosphere \n\nand the dried TMPO was transferred to the same Schleck. The mixture was heated in a \n\ntubular oven to 150 \u00b0C for 3.5 hours at a rate of 3 \u00b0C per minute, where the last 30 minutes \n\nwere under vacuum. The loaded material was left to cool down to room temperature and \n\nimmediately transferred to the Ar glove box where it was packed into a MAS rotor and \n\nstored until needed. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Experimental apparatus used for samples/TMPO dehydration and TMPO \n\nadsorption.

Solid-state NMR Measurements \n\n1\nH, \n\n27\nAl, \n\n29\nSi and \n\n31\nP NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance III 400 and \n\n700 spectrometers operating at B0 fields of 9.4 and 16.4 T (the latter was used only for \n1\nH \n\nexperiments), respectively, with \n1\nH, \n\n27\nAl, \n\n29\nSi and \n\n31\nP Larmor frequencies of 400.1 and \n\n700.1, 104.3 and 182.4, 79.5 and 139.1, 161.9 and 283.4 MHz, respectively. All \n\nexperiments performed at B0 = 9.4 T were recorded on a triple-resonance 4 mm Bruker \n\nMAS probe and at B0= 16.4 T on a triple-resonance 2.5 mm Bruker MAS probe. The \n\nsamples were packed into ZrO2 rotors with Kel-F (4 mm) or Vespel (2.5 mm) caps in the \n\nB0 fields of 9.4 and 16.4 T, respectively. Spinning rates between 12 and 35 kHz were \n\nemployed to record all the spectra. Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm using the following \n\nsecondary references: solid adamantane (1.85 ppm), aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 (0 \n\nppm), solid Q8M8 (-109.68 ppm for the furthest upfield resonance) and solid Na4P2O7 (-\n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n2.09 ppm for the furthest upfield resonance) for \n1\nH, \n\n27\nAl and \n\n29\nSi and \n\n31\nP, respectively. The \n\ndeconvolution and simulation of the NMR spectra were carried out using the program \n\nDMFIT.\n85\n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1.1. Single Pulse Experiments \n\n1\nH single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate of 15 kHz \n\nusing a 2.   s pulse ( 0\u00b0  lip-angle) that corresponds to a radio frequency (rf) field strength \n\nof ca. 89 kHz. A recycle delay (RD) of 2 s was found to be sufficient and used for all \n\nsamples. \n27\n\nAl single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate of 14 kHz \n\nusing a quantification pulse of ca. 0. 6  s ( 0\u00b0  lip angle) corresponding to a r   ield \n\nstrength of 77 kHz. A RD of 2 s was used. \n29\n\nSi single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were \n\nacquired at a spinning rate o   2 k   using a 2.6  s pulse ( 0\u00b0  lip angle) that corresponds \n\nto a rf field strength of ca. 42 kHz. A RD of 60 s was used. \n31\n\nP single-pulse excitation \n\nM S NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate o   5 k   using a  .2  s pulse ( 0\u00b0 \n\nflip angle) that corresponds to a rf field strength around 78 kHz. A RD of 20 s was used. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2. Cross-polarization Experiments \n\n29\nSi CPMAS spectra were acquired using a \n\n1\n  2.6  s pulse width ( 0\u00ba  lip angle) \n\ncorresponding to a rf field strength of ca. 96 kHz; the CP step was performed using a \n\ncontact time ( T) o   000  s with a 70? 00% R MP shape at the \n1\nH channel and a square \n\nshape pulse of 42 kHz on the \n29\n\nSi channel, a RD of 3 s and a spinning rate of 12 kHz. A \n\nSPINAL-64 decoupling scheme was used with pulses lengths o   0.5  s at a r   ield \n\nstrength of 40 kHz. \n\n31\nP CPMAS spectra were acquired using a\n\n 1\n  2.   s pulse width ( 0\u00ba  lip angle) \n\ncorresponding to a rf of ca.  0 k  , the  P step was per ormed using a  T o  2000  s with \n\na 70? 00% R MP shape at the \n1\nH channel and a square shape pulse of 51 kHz on the \n\n31\nP \n\nchannel, a RD of 2.25 s and a spinning rate of 15 kHz. A SPINAL-64 decoupling scheme \n\nwas used with pulses length o  6  s at a r   ield strength o   0 k  . \n\n \n\n3.2.1.3. Two-dimensional Experiments \n\n1\n ?\n\n29\nSi CP-HETCOR spectra were also acquired using similar conditions to those \n\nused in the 1D CP experiments; 32 t1 points with 176 scans each were recorded along the \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nindirect \n1\nH dimension. \n\n1\n ?\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR spectra were also acquired employing the \n\nsame experimental conditions as described above for the 1D CP experiment; 32 t1 points \n\nwith 176 scans each were recorded along the indirect dimension. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Computational Calculations \n\n3.2.2.1. Deprotonation Energy Calculations \n\nThe orthorhombic unit cell of a pure silica ZSM-5 has 96 tetrahedral sites (T) and \n\n12 inequivalent T sites.\n86\n\n Although the distribution of aluminum and the counter balance \n\nproton remains under discussion, several reports point as preferential sites those in the \n\ninterception between the straight and zig-zag channels of ZSM-5 (Figure 13).\n87\u201389\n\n \n\nMost of the theoretical studies that investigate the acidity from HZSM-5 clusters \n\nuse the T12 site, according to the numbering of Olson et al.,\n90\n\n as a preferential T site for \n\naluminum substitution.\n91\u201393\n\n The incorporation of one Al atom in the T12 site gives rise to \n\nfour possible centers (C1, C2, C3 and C4) that differ in the location of the counterion (H\n+\n) \n\nin neighbor oxygen atoms (O11, O12, O20, O24). \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - Representation of ZSM-5 straight channels (left) and zig-zag channels (right.

DPE can be calculated using Equation 9 where E ZH is the \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nenergy obtained for the protonated cluster and EZ the energy obtained for the unprotonated \n\ncluster (negatively charged).\n94\n\n \n\n            ( 9 ) \n\n \n\nFour 8T clusters, obtained from the crystallographic structure of ZSM-5,\n95\n\n were \n\nused to investigate the possible Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and their DPE. The terminal silicon \n\natoms were saturated with hydrogen atoms and these terminal groups ( -SiH3) were fixed in \n\ntheir crystallographic position to mimic the zeolite structure. In order to find the better \n\nmethod to optimize the structure and calculate DPE (best accuracy/calculation demand \n\nratio), some widely used DFT functionals, Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91PW91),\n96\n\n Becke \n\nLee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP),\n97,98\n\n and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE1PBE),\n99\n\n combined with \n\nthe 6-31G(d,p) basis set,\n100\n\n were tested and compared to the more time-consuming method \n\nMP2. All the calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 Rev. B.01.\n101\n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. Calculation of TMPO Adsorption \n\nIn this work, computational calculations followed the methodology used by Z heng \n\net al., that uses small clusters with a range of acidic strengths to investigate the adsorption \n\nof TMPO.\n64\n\n A 8T clusters, mentioned in the section 3.2.2.1, was chosen to investigate th e \n\ninteraction with TMPO. Figure 14 shows the cluster used in our calculations, that was \n\nchosen among the four possibilities because the acidic proton is placed at the straight \n\nchannel and near the interception with a zig-zag channel. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Representation of two TMPO-loaded ZSM-5 clusters with different Si-H bond \n\nlengths used in this work, before geometry optimization. \n\nKramer et al. found that the acidic strength in a cluster can be tuned by changing \n\nthe length from the cluster terminal Si-H bonds.\n102\n\n In this study, the same methodology \n\nwas used to investigate the interaction between TMPO and the clusters with different \n\nacidic strengths. The central part from the bare clusters (O3-Si-O(H)-Al-O3) was allowed to \n\nrelax while the terminal -SiH3 groups were fixed in the crystallographic direction and with \n\nSi-H bond lengths between 1.30 and 2.75 angstroms (\u00c5).  \n\nAfter geometry optimization, one TMPO molecules was placed at 1.0 \u00c5 from the \n\nacidic proton from each cluster, and the loaded clusters were allowed to relax while \n\nkeeping the terminal groups fixed at the same positions as in the first geometry \n\noptimization. Zheng et al. used a PW91PW91/6-31G(d,p) method to investigate the \n\nproperties from these loaded clusters.\n64\n\n In this study, two additional combinations of two \n\nwidely used DFT functionals, B3LYP and PBE1PBE, with the same basis set were tested \n\ninstead, to compare the results to those reproduced from the published methodology.\n64\n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3. Modelling \n31\n\nP NMR \n\nSeveral theoretical studies used the cluster approach to investigate the interaction of \n\nmolecules with the acid site from zeolites and obtain NMR data, providing additional \n\ninformation to the experimental results.\n64,103\n\n Zheng et al. propose a superacidity threshold \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nfor TMPO-loaded zeolites that can be observed from  \n31\n\nP MAS NMR spectra.\n64\n\n The \n\noptimized structures for the TMPO-loaded zeolites, mentioned in the previous section, \n\nwere used to predict  \n31\n\nP chemical shifts. \n\nMost of the times the NMR calculation step have lower computational demand than \n\nthe geometry optimization, hence this type of calculations used a basis set with moderate \n\nsize for the geometry optimization step and a larger one for the chemical shielding \n\ncalculation. Zheng et al. used the combination HF/TZVP//PW91PW91/6 -31G(d,p) \n\n(Chemical shifts//Geometry Optimization) to obtain theoretical NMR parameters for the \n\nTMPO-loaded cluster.\n64\n\n In this study, the same combination was applied in order to \n\nreplicate these published results and other combinations were tested. \n\nNMR calculations require the use of a reference to obtain the chemical shift; in this \n\nwork we have used two references: TMPO (41 ppm) and H3PO4 (0 ppm). In this study, the \n\nNMR calculations were performed using the gauge including atomic orbital (GIAO) \n\nmethod,\n104,105\n\n as implemented in Gaussian 09 Rev. B.01..\n101\n\n The chemical shifts were \n\nobtained by using two references, TMPO (41 ppm) and H3PO4 (0 ppm). The chemical shift \n\nfor a given nucleus X (?X) can be obtained with Equation 10,\n106\n\n where ?ref and ?X are the \n\nabsolute chemical shielding obtained from the calculation of the reference compound \n\nand the nucleus X, respectively, and ?ref stands for the experimental chemical shift. \n\nBoth the reference and the molecule shielding should be calculated using the same \n\ncombination (NMR and geometry optimization).  \n\n \n\n                 ( 10 ) \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\n4.1. Solid-state NMR Results \n\n4.1.1. Characterization of Silicon Environments \n\nSilicon is one of most abundant elements on the zeolite structure, however, the low \n\nnatural abundance of the NMR active isotope and the narrow chemical shift range from \n\nsilicon atoms onto the zeolitic framework, make the identification of acid sites using \n29\n\nSi \n\nMAS NMR very difficult. Usually, the \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectrum from zeolites is used to \n\nestimate the Si/Al ratio, however, all the samples used in this study have ratios ca. 20, \n\nobtained by ICP analysis, thus the Si/Al ratio for these samples can not be obtained from \n\nthe \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra using Equation 7. \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra (A and B) and \n29\n\nSi CPMAS NMR (C and D) spectra of \n\n29\nSi-enriched MFI20 sample before (A and B) and after (C and D) TMPO adsorption. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nFigure 15 shows the \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR and \n29\n\nSi CPMAS NMR spectra from the \n\nsample MFI20 (a sodic sample NaZSM-5) before and after adsorption of TMPO probe \n\nmolecules. The spectra show two regions with intense peaks between -108 and -120 ppm, \n\nwith two major \n29\n\nSi resonances around -112 and -115 ppm, and a less intense region \n\nbetween -97 and -108 ppm, showing a broad distribution of different silicon sites. As \n\nshown in the spectra, an additional resonance at ca. 98 ppm appears in the \n29\n\nSi CPMAS \n\nNMR spectrum (Figure 15D) from the loaded zeolite that should arise from the interaction \n\nof a TMPO molecule with a Si(1Al) site (Br\u00f8nsted acid site). This peak is enhanced in the \n\nCPMAS experiment because the large number of hydrogens from TMPO molecule can \n\ntransfer magnetization to the near silicon atom.  \n\n Since the \n29\n\nSi MAS NMR spectra of zeolites have a narrow chemical shift range, it \n\ncan be a challenge to assign all the Si(nAl) species, especially in materials with higher \n\nSi/Al ratios, where the Si(0Al) is predominant. A 2D \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi CP-HETCOR NMR \n\nexperiment was performed to assign the Si(nAl) sites. The TMPO-loaded sample was used \n\nin this experiment to take advantage from the large number of protons in the probe methyl \n\ngroups, that act as an \u201cantenna\u201d that trans er polari ation to the near silicon atoms, via CP. \n\nThe 2D \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi CP-HETCOR of the unloaded sample has not afforded enough sensitivity \n\nto obtain a high-quality spectrum.  The 2D \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi CP-HETCOR spectrum (Figure 16) \n\nshows a broad \n29\n\nSi resonance containing multiple Si(0Al) sites (between -101 and -118 \n\nppm),\n107\n\n which correlates with the \n1\nH resonance at ca. 2.2 ppm, associated with terminal \n\nsilanol protons (Si-OH).\n108\n\n On the other hand, the \n29\n\nSi resonance at -98.7 ppm correlates \n\nwith protons at 4.8 ppm; a typical \n1\nH resonance (4.3 ppm) for acidic bridging hydroxyls in \n\nZSM-5,\n108\n\n therefore the \n29\n\nSi peak can be assigned to Si(1Al) sites. Since the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi \n\nCP-HETCOR spectrum of Figure 16 refers to a NaZSM-5 sample, the number of bridging \n\nhydroxyls is residual; an HZSM-5 zeolite, that has a larger number of acidic protons, \n\nwould have given a stronger \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi correlation between this spin pair. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - \n1\nH-\n\n29\nSi CP-HETCOR spectrum from a TMPO-loaded MFI20 sample, showing the \n\ncorrelations of Si(0Al) groups with silanol protons and of Si(1Al) groups and bridging \n\nhydroxyl protons. \n\n4.1.2. Characterization of FAL and EFAL species \n\n27\nAl MAS NMR experiments from unloaded zeolites can provide information about \n\nthe type and geometry of the aluminum species, thus allowing the identification of acid \n\ntypes. Generally, these spectra have typically three main chemical shift regions around 50, \n\n30 and 0 ppm, corresponding to tetrahedral framework aluminum (FAL), distorted \n\ntetrahedra or pentacoordinate EFAL and octahedral EFAL species, respectively.\n21\n\n \n\nHowever, the low symmetry of EFAL species leads to stronger quadrupolar environments, \n\nwhich broadens the \n27\n\nAl NMR signal precluding its observation. These species are often \n\nknown as \u201cinvisible\u201d aluminum species,\n49\n\n thus making the identification of Lewis acid \n\nsites harder. When exposed to humidity, the EFAL species coordinate to the water \n\nmolecules that increase their symmetry giving narrower \n27\n\nAl resonance.\n49\n\n \n\nOver the course of this work, several zeolite samples were prepared with different \n\nproperties to better exploit SSNMR experiments in the study of acid species. The different \n\nsamples prepared are listed in Table 3, which shows what chemical information was \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nobtained by specific SSNMR methods.  For example, different templates or/and \n\ncounterions were employed. Although many different templates (Figure S1 and S2) were \n\nused to synthesize HZSM-5 (Table 3), the main focus will be on TPA\n+\n and BTA templates. \n\nThe \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR spectra of  MFI64 (BTA) and MFI8 (TPA\n+\n) zeolite samples (Figure \n\n17) show a common resonance at around 55 ppm while the \n27\n\nAl spectrum of the former \n\nsample shows a peak at 0 ppm, generally assigned to FAL and EFAL species,\n21,51\n\n \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR spectra of hydrated ZSM-5 zeolites: dealuminated sample MFI64 \n\n(red) and sample MFI8 (blue). \n\nThe distinct structure of the template molecules (Figure S2) seems to have an \n\ninfluence on the type of acids formed in the zeolite samples. Thermogravimetric analysis \n\n(TGA) results, from several ZSM-5 samples synthesized with different templates, showed \n\nthat the calcination temperature (temperature required to fully remove the template), \n\ndepends on the chosen template (Figure S1). The analysis from TGA results shows that \n\nZSM-5 zeolites synthesized with TPA\n+\n template require a temperature of 500 \u00baC, while \n\nthose synthesized with BTA template require a higher temperature of 700 \u00baC, to fully \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nremove the template. Other templates such as ETA, IPA and DEA also required higher \n\ncalcination temperatures. In order to increase the amount of EFAL species, the HZSM-5 \n\nsample synthesized with BTA template was subjected to two additional dealumination \n\ntreatments with acetylacetone and a strong solution of HCl (more details in Appendix F). \n\nThe \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR spectra showed no increase of the 6-coordinated Al site (ca. 0 ppm) \n\nfor the sample treated with acetylacetone and a slight increase for the sample treated with \n\nat strong acidic conditions, meaning that either the acidic treatment removes a small \n\namount o  F L atoms or most o  the EF L generated with this treatment are \u201cinvisible \n\naluminum\u201d species, even when the samples are hydrated (Figure S12). Usually, ZSM-5 \n\nzeolites are quite resistant to dealumination treatments and require strong treatments to \n\nobtain a large amount EFAL species.\n109\n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.3. Characterization of Acid Sites using \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nAs mentioned before, \n1\nH MAS NMR limitations make it hard to get detailed \n\ninformation about the acidic feature of zeolites acid sites. Nonetheless, \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nmeasurements have been intensively used in the past to investigate zeolites acidity,\n39,108,110\u2013\n\n112\n giving good preliminary information. In this work, one HZSM-5 sample (MFI8) was \n\nused to investigate zeolites acidity using \n1\nH MAS NMR experiments. \n\nThe spectrum from the HZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 18) shows four main resonances \n\ncentered at 1.4, 1.9, 4.1 and 6.4 ppm. As expected, the spectrum shows multiple resonances \n\nbetween 1 and 2 ppm, corresponding to non-acidic protons from silanol groups (Si-OH)  at \n\nthe external surface or from framework defects.\n41\n\n Strongly acidic protons appear in the \n1\nH \n\nMAS NMR spectrum of well-dehydrated HZSM-5 typically at 4.3 ppm, which is assigned \n\nto the bridging hydroxyl group (Si-O(H)-Al), whereas a broader \n1\nH resonance at 6.4 ppm \n\narises from disturbed bridging hydroxyl groups interacting with neighbor oxygen atoms.\n39\n\n \n\nThe \n1\nH MAS NMR spectra of the HZSM-5 sample (MFI8) dehydrated at distinct \n\nconditions showed significant differences (Figure S5). In this work, only the stronger \n\ndehydration procedure (300 \u00b0C for 6h at 10\n-2\n\n Pa) gives rise to the typical \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nspectrum of a dehydrated HZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 18). In contrast, the \n1\nH MAS NMR \n\nspectra of the HZSM-5 dehydrated with weaker conditions (Figure S5), show a downfield \n\nshift for the \n1\nH resonance, resulting for the rapid exchange between the water protons and \n\nboth the silanol and Br\u00f8nsted sites protons.\n41\n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - \n1\nH MAS NMR spectrum of a fully dehydrated HZSM-5 zeolite (sample MFI8). \n\nThe dashed red curve corresponds to the simulated spectra and the black curves to either \n\nLorentzian or a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. \n\nEven though several studies used phosphorous probes to investigate zeolites \n\nacidity, very few reports of \n1\nH MAS NMR spectra of TMPO-loaded zeolites can be found \n\nin the literature.\n61\n\n In this work, the \n1\nH MAS NMR spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI8 \n\nsample (Figure 19) is used to observe the differences before and after the adsorption of \n\nTMPO and obtain information that can help in the interpretation of results from the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP HETCOR experiments (section 4.1.4.3). The results from Gaussian peaks \n\ndeconvolution revealed five major resonances at 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, 1.4 and 1.3 that arise from \n\nTMPO methyl groups in distinct chemical environments. The \n1\nH chemical shifts at 13.0, \n\n8.1, 6.8 and 6.0 ppm (Figure 18) are tentatively assigned to \n1\nH environments with different \n\nacid strengths interacting with TMPO. It is important to point that the resonance at 4.3 ppm \n\nfrom the TMPO-unloaded zeolite vanished, indicating that all bridging hydroxyls are \n\ninteracting with TMPO molecules. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - \n1\nH MAS NMR spectra deconvoluted using Gaussian curves (black) of a TMPO-\n\nloaded HZSM-5 sample (MFI8).

Characterization of Acid Sites using \n31\n\nP MAS NMR \n\nEven though TMPO probe molecules have unique characteristics that allow the \n\nidentification of several acidic features from both Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites, some of \n\nthe assignments found in the literature remain somewhat controversial.\n63\n\n In order to \n\naddress this problem, a combination of materials with different features were prepared and \n\nloaded with TMPO (Figure 20). As mentioned before, aluminum atoms act as a source of \n\nacidity in zeolites, both Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis. In principle, if we can replace, at least, all \n\nprotons from bridging hydroxyls with other non-acidic counterions (e.g. Na\n+\n and K\n\n+\n), it \n\nwould be possible to remove all the Br\u00f8nsted acid centers. Usually, zeolites have a low \n\namount of Lewis acid centers, that can be enhanced by dealuminating zeolites, a process \n\nthat generates EFAL species by expelling FAL species. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20 - Schematic representation of the chosen strategy used to investigate the interaction \n\nof TMPO with acid and non-acidic sites. The spectra are color coded accordingly to \n31\n\nP \n\nenvironments, red for environments that appear in the NaZSM-5 zeolite, blue for the HZSM-5 \n\nzeolite and green for the dealuminated HZSM-5. \n\n4.1.4.1. One dimensional experiments \n\nDespite the efforts of several authors, the assignments of \n31\n\nP environments in \n\nTMPO-loaded zeolites remain to some extent controversial.\n42,63,113\n\n The approach used in \n\nthis work tries to provide additional data about \n31\n\nP MAS NMR spectra of TMPO loaded \n\nzeolites, using ZSM-5 zeolites with different acidic features. Figure 21 displays the \n31\n\nP \n\nCPMAS NMR spectra of MFI20 (A; NaZSM-5), MFI8 (B; HZSM-5) and MFI64 (C; \n\ndealuminated HZSM-5) samples. The \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR spectrum shows from the \n\nNaZSM-5 sample shows no \n31\n\nP resonance higher than 60 ppm, which usually indicate the \n\nabsence of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites.\n24,42\n\n On the other hand, both the \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR spectra \n\nof HZSM-5 and the dealuminated samples show resonances higher than 60 ppm. Often this \n\nregion, ?31P > 60 ppm, is assigned to TMPO interacting with distinct strength Br\u00f8nsted acid \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nsites, however, this work shows that the interaction of TMPO with Lewis acid sites might \n\nalso generate species resonating at \n31\n\nP chemical shifts higher than 60 ppm.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 - \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectra of three ZSM-5 samples loaded with TMPO a) a NaZSM-5 \n\n(MFI20), b) HZSM-5 (MFI8) and dealuminated HZSM-5 (MFI64). \n\nEight \n31\n\nP resonances around 54, 48, 43, 41, 37, 35, 30 and 29 ppm, can be \n\nidentified in the deconvoluted \n31\n\nP CPMAS\n \nNMR spectrum for the TMPO-loaded MFI20 \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nsample. Based on the results from Zhao et al., the resonance at ca. 29 ppm can be assigned \n\nto \u201cmobile\u201d TMPO weakly adsorbed on the channel opening or in the intercrystalline \n\nvoids.\n63\n\n Results presented in the next section (section 4.1.4.3) show that this resonance \n\narises from TMPO interacting with the zeolite internal surface and not from the interaction \n\nin intercrystalline voids. The assignment from resonances around 36 ppm remains \n\nsomewhat controversial. Hayashi et al. assigned this resonance to TMPO physisorbed into \n\na small site of a silicalite sample (pure silica material analogue to ZSM-5),\n114\n\n refuting the \n\nassignment made earlier by Rakiewicz et al.,\n37\n\n that assigned the same resonance to an \n\ninteraction between TMPO and a Lewis center. This resonance has considerable less \n\nrelative intensity in the \n31\n\nP NMR spectra from the MFI64 sample (Figure 21C), that have a \n\nlarger amount o  EF L species than both MFI  and MFI20 samples, thus shouldn\u2019t arise \n\nfrom TMPO interacting with a Lewis acid site. The resonance at 41 ppm can be easily \n\nassigned to crystalline TMPO (Figure S4) and the small shoulder at 43 ppm to physisorbed \n\nTMPO,\n37,63\n\n this latter assignment was assigned with a triple resonance \n1\nH/\n\n31\nP/\n\n27\nAl \n\nTRAPDOR, that revealed no correlation between this resonance with aluminium atoms.\n37\n\n \n\nLang et al. also used TMPO to investigate Lewis acidity in several materials,\n59\n\n founding a \n\nresonance around 48 ppm was consistent along the tested materials. Early reports from \n31\n\nP \n\nMAS NMR of loaded amorphous silica-alumina samples assigned the peak at around 54 \n\nppm to TMPO interacting with Lewis centers,\n115\n\n other studies suggested that this \n\nresonance arises from TMPO interacting with weak Br\u00f8nsted acid sites.\n37,63\n\n The \n\nassignment of these latter resonances (48 and 54 ppm) can be quite challenging using only \n\n1D \n31\n\nP NMR experiments, thus additional 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP NMR experiments were performed, \n\nproviding more information about these environments (section 4.1.4.4.).  \n\nThe \n31\n\nP CPMAS\n \nspectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI8 sample loaded shows \n\neight main resonances at 86, 76, 68, 65, 48, 43, 36, 28 ppm and two additional peaks at 75 \n\nand 53 ppm were obtained from peak deconvolution using Gaussian curves (Figure 21B). \n\nThis spectrum produces similar results to those reported by Zhao et al.,\n37,63\n\n with two \n\nadditional resonances around 68 and 36 ppm. As expected, this TMPO -loaded sample has \n\n31\nP resonance at chemical shifts higher than 60 ppm, usually assigned to TMPO interacting \n\nwith Br\u00f8nsted acid sites with increasing strength, from 60 to 80 ppm.\n24,42\n\n However, several \n\nresults in this work show that the interaction of TMPO with Lewis acid sites might result in \n\nresonance in this spectral region. Furthermore, the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR experiments \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nshowed that the Br\u00f8nsted acidic strength has no proportional correlation with the \n31\n\nP \n\nchemical shift, detailed discussion in section 4.1.4.4. \n\nIn order to investigate the influence EFAL species (Lewis acid sites) in the \n31\n\nP \n\nNMR spectra of ZSM-5 zeolites, a dealuminated HZSM-5 zeolite was prepared (MFI64). \n\nRecently, Zhao et al. reported one \n31\n\nP above 80 ppm that was assigned to TMPO \n\ninteracting with a strong acid center, arising from a Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis syner gic center.\n116\n\n \n\nFigure 21C shows the \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI64, showing a \n\ncharacteristic profile from a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5 sample with an additional peak at 93 \n\nppm. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first report of a \n31\n\nP resonance higher than 86 \n\nppm, that was suggested as the threshold for superacidity in TMPO -loaded HZSM-5 \n\nzeolites.\n64\n\n Since this resonance appears only on a sample with a considerable amount of \n\nEFAL species (Figure 17), is expected that this resonance arises from TMPO interacting \n\nwith these species. Usually, TMPO-loaded zeolites are exposed to humidity, because the \n\nTMPO interact weakly with Lewis acid sites and are replaced by water molecules, \n\nresulting in a significant decrease of \n31\n\nP resonance associated with this interaction. Figure \n\n22 shows \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI64 sample before and after \n\nbeing exposed to air overnight. This procedure resulted in an overall decrease in intensity, \n\nbeing more evident for the resonance at 75 ppm that before air exposure is the more intense \n\npeak and after appears only as a shoulder from the resonance at 63 ppm. An important \n\nresult from this experiment is that both resonances at 86 and 93 ppm disappeared \n\ncompletely upon sample hydration, which might indicate that these resonances are \n\nassociated with TMPO interacting with Lewis centers. However, the large difference for \n\nthe peak at 75 ppm, usually assigned to TMPO interacting with Br\u00f8nsted sites, indicates \n\nthat long periods of humidity exposure can affect also the stronger interaction between \n\nTMPO molecules and the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. Hence it is important to find new methods \n\nthat can unambiguously identify the acidic centers that interact with TMPO molecules, like \n\nthose presented in section 4.1.4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectra from a dealuminated sample (MFI64) loaded with TMPO \n\nbefore (top) and after (bottom) being exposed to air humidity overnight. \n\n4.1.4.3. Assessing Acid Sites Location \n\nAn alternative approach that avoids the use of different molecular probes was used, \n\nin this work, to discriminate external and internal acid sites.\n63\n\n This approach was suggested \n\nby Wiper et al.,\n60\n\n and requires one as-synthesized sample and one calcinated sample. \n\nBefore the calcination step the inside volume of a pore is totally occupied with template \n\nmolecules, thus only the external sites are accessible to TMPO molecules. Using this \n\napproach, it is possible to discriminate internal from external acid sites. \n\nFigure 23 shows the deconvoluted \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectrum from the as-synthesized \n\nZSM-5 zeolite (MFI17), that exhibit that exhibits eight \n31\n\nP resonance at ca. 60, 56, 50, 43, \n\n41, 37, 35 and ppm that can be assigned to TMPO interacting with the external surface of \n\nthe zeolite. The resonances at 50, 43, 41 and 37 ppm dominate the \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR \n\nspectrum of the as-synthesized sample and can be assigned to TMPO interacting with the \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nexternal surface of the zeolite. Additional data obtained with this experiment indicates that \n\nthe \n31\n\nP resonances at 43 and 41 ppm previously assigned to physisorbed and crystalline \n\nTMPO, arise from TMPO at the external surface of the zeolite. Since the resonances at ca. \n\n60, 56 and 50 ppm only appear in the spectrum of the as-synthesized sample, these can be \n\nunambiguously assigned to TMPO at the external surface of the material.  \n\nOn the other hand, the \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR spectrum from the calcinated analogue \n\nmaterial (MFI20, Figure 21B) shows additional peaks at 66, 54, 48 and 29 ppm that can be \n\nassigned to TMPO adsorbed into internal acid site. This spectrum shows one intense \n\nresonance at ca. 30 ppm that are faint in the \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR spectrum from the MFI17 \n\n(material with occupied pores) zeolite, thus can be assigned to TMPO interacting with an \n\ninternal site. In their work, Wiper et al. mentioned that the template molecules leave some \n\nempty space near the pore opening, allowing the interaction of TMPO molecules with  \n\nsome internal acid sites.\n60\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23 - \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectrum of an as-synthesized sample (MFI17) with blocked pores \n\nloaded with TMPO. \n\n4.1.4.4. Two-dimensional experiments \n\n2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR experiments from TMPO-loaded zeolites provide \n\ninformation about the chemical environment surrounding the phosphorous probe, allowing \n\nthe identification of the acidic centres in close proximity to the phosphorous sites.  Figure \n\n24 and 25 show the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO-loaded as-\n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nsynthesized ZSM-5 (Figure 24A), calcined NaZSM-5 (Figure 24B), HZSM-5 (Figure 25A) \n\nand a dealuminated HZSM-5 (Figure 25B) samples. As expected, the most intense cross-\n\npeak in all 2D spectra is the correlation between methyl protons from TMPO, around 1 and \n\n2 ppm, and the phosphorous nucleus. \n\n  \n\nFigure 24 - 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR spectra of a) an as-synthesized ZSM-5 sample (MFI17) \n\nwith occupied pores and b) a calcined NaZSM-5 sample (MFI20), showing the major \n\ncorrelations in blue. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe results from the \n31\n\nP CPMAS NMR spectrum (Figure 23) from the as-\n\nsynthesized sample (blocked pores) revealed the \n31\n\nP resonances that can be assigned to \n\nTMPO interacting with external sites. However, no information about the specific protons \n\ninvolved in the \n1\n ?\n\n31\nP polarization can be obtained from the 1D spectrum and therefore \n\n2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR experiments on the pore blocked ZSM-5 were performed. Figure \n\n24A shows \n31\n\nP resonances at ca. 43 and 37 exhibiting correlations with \n1\nH resonances at \n\nca. 10.0 and 8.6 ppm, respectively, while the broad \n31\n\nP resonance at 49 ppm correlates with \n\nprotons resonating around 7 ppm. These extremely faint resonances (the external sur face is \n\nmuch lower than the internal one) should arise from TMPO near either weak acidic \n\nprotons, such as terminal Si-OH or near template molecules (more detailed discussion \n\nbelow). In addition, a faint cross-peak appearing at a \n1\nH chemical shift of ca. 14 ppm is \n\nalso correlated with \n31\n\nP resonances at ca. 48, 42 and 39 ppm, which may arise from TMPO \n\ninteracting with Bronsted acid sites as a higher \n1\nH deshielding usually reveal the presence \n\nof stronger acid sites. \n\nOn the other hand, the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR NMR spectrum of the TMPO-\n\nloaded NaZSM-5 (empty pore) is similar to the \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR spectrum of the pore \n\nblocked zeolite, except for the resonances at ca. 54 and 29 ppm, that have a significant \n\nincrease in intensity when the template is removed, thus corresponding to internal sites. \n\nThe 31P resonance at ca. show no correlation with a \n1\nH environment and thus can be \n\nassigned to TMPO interacting with a Lewis center. The \n31\n\nP resonances observed in Figure \n\n24B are likely associated with TMPO interacting at the external surface of the material, \n\nexcept for resonances at ca. 29 and 54 ppm.  \n\nThe 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR spectrum of a NaZSM-5 zeolite synthesized without \n\ntemplate (ALM40, Figure S6) shows no \n31\n\nP-\n1\nH cross peaks ranging from 5 to 11 ppm, in \n\ncontrast to the analogue MFI20 sample. Other zeolites synthesized without template, \n\nALM40H (Figure S7) and ALM39H (Figure S8), showed fewer cross peaks, in the \n\nmentioned range, then the analogue HZSM-5 materials synthesized with template (Figure \n\n25, S10 and S11). It is possible that the cross peaks in this range arise from TMPO \n\ninteracting with template molecules, however, additional data is required to unambiguously \n\nassign these peaks. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25 - 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR spectra of a) HZSM-5 sample (MFI8) and b) a \n\ndealuminated HZSM-5 sample (MFI64), showing the major correlations in blue. \n\nFigure 25 displays the 2D spectra of two HZSM-5, MFI8 and MFI64 \n\n(dealuminated) samples. This figure shows clearly that when a NaZSM-5 zeolite (Figure \n\n24B) is converted to its HZSM-5 counterpart (Figure 25) and loaded with TMPO, the 2D \n\n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-HETCOR NMR spectra shows a new set of \n\n31\nP resonances appearing above 60 \n\nppm associated to Br\u00f8nsted acidity as shown previously.  Several papers state that, in these \n\nsystems, Br\u00f8nsted acidity strength is directly correlated with the \n31\n\nP chemical shift and that \n\n31\nP resonances in the ranges of 90-80, 80-70 and 70-60 ppm arise from TMPO interacting \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nwith very strong, strong and weak Br\u00f8nsted acid sites, respectively.\n117\n\n The 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP CP-\n\nHETCOR NMR spectrum of MFI8 sample (Figure 25A) exhibits a strongly distributed \n\ncross-peak covering a range of highly deshielded \n1\nH chemical shifts (ca. 12 to 17 ppm) that \n\ncorrelate with various \n31\n\nP resonances higher than 60 ppm revealing the proximity between \n\nTMPO molecules and strong acid centers. It is generally accepted in the literature that \n\nhigher \n31\n\nP and \n1\nH chemical shifts are associated to stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. Analyzing \n\nthe 2D spectra of Figure 25 this is not the case, i.e., we observe that as \n31\n\nP chemical shifts \n\nare increasing within the  r\u00f8nsted region (?P > 60 ppm) the \n1\nH chemical shifts are \n\ndecreasing. For example, the most deshielded \n31\n\nP resonance at 87 ppm is correlated with a \n\n1\nH resonance ca. 8 ppm while a cross peak between a \n\n31\nP resonance at ca. 48 ppm and a \n\n1\nH \n\nresonance at ca. 14 ppm. The 2D spectrum reveals correlations between \n31\n\nP resonances \n\noutside the region of stronger Br\u00f8nsted sites (?P  &lt;60 ppm) and highly acidic protons. In \n\naddition, the resonance at 86 ppm, that has been pointed out as the threshold to \n\nsuperacidity,\n64\n\n shows no correlation in the 2D  HETCOR spectrum, indicating that this \n\nresonance can be assigned to TMPO interacting with a Lewis acid center. In fact, only a \n\nminor shoulder at 87 ppm exhibits a correlation with an intermediate strength Br\u00f8nsted \n\nacid site (8 ppm). These new results also reveal the presence of two \n31\n\nP resonances at 86 \n\nand 87 ppm indicating that the former arises from the interaction of TMPO with a strong \n\nLewis acid site, while the latter resonance could be associated to an interaction of TMPO \n\nwith a synergic Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis center.\n116\n\n \n\nAs mentioned in the previous topic, the \n31\n\nP CPMAS spectrum from the \n\ndealuminated sample (MFI64) showed for the first time a resonance at ca. 93 ppm (above \n\nthe superacidity threshold ?P = 86 ppm) for a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5. During this work, \n\nonly the dealuminated sample showed this peak at 93 ppm, which strongly indicates that \n\nthis \n31\n\nP resonance arises from the EFAL species originated during the dealumination \n\nprocess. Since the 2D \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP HETCOR spectrum (Figure 25B) shows no cross-peak \n\ninvolving the \n31\n\nP peak at 93 ppm and the acid sites (protons > 5 ppm) this \n31\n\nP resonance \n\ncan be unambiguously assigned to TMPO adsorbed into a Lewis acidic center.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n4.2. Computational Results  \n\n4.2.1. Modelling Br\u00f8nsted sites in HZSM-5 \n\nIt is known that DPE converges both with the increase of the cluster and basis set \n\nsize,\n118\n\n thus it is possible to obtain accurate results with moderate size basis sets and \n\nclusters. In this study, three widely used DFT functional were tested to obtained DPE \n\nvalues for the four-possible locations where the balancing H\n+\n can be placed, when the T12 \n\nsite is replaced with an aluminum atom. Results from this study pointed DPE values \n\nbetween 1142 and 1279 kJ mol\n-1\n\n, that agree with a previous report around 1200 kJ mol\n-1\n\n \n\nfor a larger Al-ZSM-5 cluster (51T) optimized also with a large basis set (6 -\n\n311++G(3df,3pd)).\n118\n\n Several studies investigate the influence of aluminum distribution, \n\nplace where the Si???>Al substitution occurs, in the acidic strength of a cluster.\n76,77,119\n\n The \n\nresults presented in this section show that the H\n+\n location can also influence the cluster \n\nacidic strength. \n\nAs shown in Figure 26 all the DFT functionals and the MP2 methods tested pointed \n\nthe centers C2 (Si11-O11-Al12) and C3 (Si20-O20-Al12) (see section 3.2.2.1.) as the \n\nweakest and the strongest acid centers, respectively. Most of the times, the calculation \n\nusing MP2 method can obtain high accuracy results with very long calculations times. In \n\nthis system, the DFT calculations using both B3LYP and PBE1PBE functionals gave \n\nresults close to those obtained with the more computational demanding method MP2, with \n\nthe larger difference being 4 kJ?mol\n-1\n\n. Thus, DFT calculations will be used in the next \n\nsection because they were almost 20 times faster than using MP2 method. Even though the \n\nC3 center showed a stronger acidic strength, most of the times the center C1 (Si24-O24-\n\nAl12) is chosen in ZSM-5 cluster, because in it is located at the intersection of the straight \n\nand zig-zag channels, and is widely accessible to adsorb molecules. Thus, in the next \n\ncalculations this will be the used center. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Comparison between three different DFT functionals and an MP2 method used to \n\nobtain DPE (kJ?mol-1) values for an 8T ZSM-5 cluster with an Al placed in the T12 site. \n\nAs shown in Table 4, the increase of the Si-H terminal bond, from the bare zeolites, \n\nleads to an increase of the bridging hydroxyl bond length between 0.969 and 0.981, that \n\nlies in the range proposed for O-H distance from acid groups in HZSM-5 zeolites.\n118,120\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the elongation of Si-H bonds from SiH3 terminal groups leads to a decrease \n\nin DPE value, except in the earlier stages, reflecting an increase in acidity strength.

This increase in OZH bond length is accompanied by a \n\ndecrease in the distance between the acid proton and the probe oxygen (HOT), however, \n\nneither the increase or decrease in O ZH and HOT lengths is linear as a function of the Si-H \n\ndistances. The exchange functionals PBE1PBE and B3LYP showed similar variations for \n\nboth OZH and HOT distances (Figure 27). For these two functionals the OZH distance \n\nincrease slowly from Si-H lengths between 1.3 and 1.5 \u00c5, then increase rapidly as the Si -H \n\ndistance increases from 1.5 to 1.6 \u00c5 and then the O ZH increases again slowly until the last \n\nSi-H bond length (2.75 \u00c5). On the other hand, results obtained with the exchange \n\nfunctional PW91PW91 have a distinct behaviour for the initial Si-H distances (Figure 27). \n\nThe computational results show that the increase of Si-H length results in a decrease of the \n\ndistance between the acid proton and the probe molecule (HOT), resulting in the formation \n\nof a TMPOH\n+\n complex, for Si-  ? 2. 5 \u00c5 (Figure S3).  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Influence of increasing the terminal groups length (Si-H) in the bond length of the \n\nacidic group (O-H), both the distances are quoted in angstroms \u00c5. \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Modelling \n31\n\nP NMR \n\nIn this work, the results obtained with 2D SSNMR experiments supported some of \n\nthe assignments made so far, however, some new results contradict other assignments. \n\nAiming to reproduce the results reported by Zheng et al.,\n64\n\n the same procedure was \n\nadopted to calculate the \n31\n\nP NMR resonances for TMPO adsorbed at an 8T cluster with \n\ntuned acidic strength. This methodology was applied to calculate chemical shielding from \n\nthe TMPO-loaded clusters to solid-state TMPO (41 ppm), that with the reported exchange-\n\ncorrelation/basis set combination for the calculations of \n31\n\nP chemical shifts (HF/TZVP) \n\nand geometry optimization (PW91PW91/6-31G(d,p)). The calculated absolute \n31\n\nP \n\nchemical shielding value for solid TMPO was 407.394 ppm, using the same level of \n\ntheory. \n\nAs shown in Table 6, the results obtained, using the suggested method, showed a \n\nsignificant distance from those reported in the literature. This variation may arise from the \n\nuse of a different T site for Al substitution or the use of a different software. A well-\n\naccepted \n31\n\nP NMR reference, phosphoric acid (H3PO4), was used to investigate the \n\ninfluence of a different \n31\n\nP NMR reference in these results. Presumably, the NMR \n\ncalculations should give similar results, with either reference. However, the results \n\nobtained using H3PO4 and TMPO as references showed surprisingly distant results, which \n\nmight indicate a poor description of the phosphorous atom in this TMPO systems, using \n\n1,00\n\n1,10\n\n1,20\n\n1,30\n\n1,40\n\n1,50\n\n1,60\n\n1,70\n\n1,80\n\n1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00\n\nO\nZ\n\n-H\n \n\nSi-H \n\nPW91PW91/6-31G(d,p) B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) PBE1PBE/6-31G(d,p)\n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nthis combination.

The calculation resulted in a \n31\n\nP chemical shift of 3.2 \n\nppm, that is substantially different from the experimental results for both TMPO in \n\nsolution (36.2 ppm)\n124\n\n and crystalline TMPO (41 ppm). However, some studies reported \n\nthat the calculation of \n31\n\nP chemical shift requires more complex methods and larger basis \n\nsets.\n106,123\n\n A calculation using more demanding method for the GIAO calculation (MP2) \n\nwith the same basis set and geometry optimization combination, resulted in a chemical \n\nshift of 1.4 ppm for TMPO when referenced against H3PO4. Thus, it is possible that the \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nTZVP basis set lack in the representation of the phosphorous atom and its interaction. It is \n\nthus surprising that many examples in the literature use this combination to calculate \n31\n\nP \n\nchemical shifts. \n\nSeveral combinations have been tested in this work, using different methods (DFT \n\nand MP2), functionals (PBE1PBE, B3LYP and PW91PW91) and basis sets, to find the \n\nbetter combination that can accurately describe the TMPO molecule with a reasonable \n\ncomputational cost. As shown in Table 7, even computational demanding methods with \n\nlarger basis sets give rise to \n31\n\nP chemical shifts with a significant difference from those \n\nobserved in NMR experiments for TMPO. These calculations showed also that B3LYP \n\nfunctional gives rise to theoretical chemical shifts closer to the experimental values than \n\nthe ones obtained by MP2 calculations, not because it is a suitable level of theory but \n\nbecause B3LYP functional leads to an overestimation of the \n31\n\nP chemical shift, as \n\ndiscussed in a previous report.\n123\n\n Ideally, the results obtained for both references and \n\nloaded systems, should be compared with results from gas phase NMR. Unfortunately, \n\nthere is no report of gas state NMR experimental results for TMPO or TMPO -loaded \n\nzeolites, which can lead to inaccurate results. Most of the times, gas phase calculations can \n\ngive similar results to liquid and solid-state NMR results, however, for polar molecules, \n\nsuch as TMPO, this difference is larger and cannot be ignored.\n106\n\n Since none of the \n\ncombinations showed good agreement with experimental results, none of them was applied \n\nto TMPO-loaded clusters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nTable 7 - Comparison between different combinations of methods, functionals and basis set \n\n(NMR//Geometry optimization) tested to obtain calculated \n31\n\nP chemical shift results using \n\nGIAO method.

Conclusions and Future Work \n\n5.1. Main Conclusions \n\nThe main objective of this work was to obtain new insights into zeolites acidity \n\nusing SSNMR, more precisely the study of acidity using a phosphorous basic probe \n\n(TMPO). Even though zeolites have been extensively studied in the past, achieving a \n\ncomplete characterization of their structure and properties can be quite challenging. In this \n\nwork, a series of \n1\nH and \n\n31\nP NMR techniques were employed. In particular, 2D \n\n1\nH-\n\n31\nP \n\nHETCOR NMR experiments were used for the first time to investigate TMPO-loaded \n\nzeolites. This technique is sensitive to \n31\n\nP\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n1\nH proximities, providing chemical \n\ninformation about the acid sites where the TMPO is adsorbed. In addition, the 2D s pectra \n\nwere also able to differentiate between stronger and weaker Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. The \n\nexperiments presented in this thesis provide new data that may support or refute some of \n\nthe resonance assignments made earlier. Two results presented in this thesis were \n\nespecially revealing: First, the peak at 86 ppm, that was pointed out as the threshold for \n\nsuperacidity,\n64\n\n exhibited a correlation with a \n1\nH resonance at an intermediate chemical \n\nshift of ca. 8 ppm (not typical of a highly acidic proton strongly H -bonded to the TMPO \n\nbase), indicating that this resonance arises from a synergic Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis acid site;\n116\n\n \n\nSecond, dealuminated HZSM-5 zeolites loaded with TMPO, may give \n31\n\nP resonances \n\npertaining with the formation of a very strong Lewis acid site, in a region usually assigned \n\nto strong Br\u00f8nsted acid sites ( > 80 ppm). \n\nIn this work, a successful strategy was implemented to investigate the acidic \n\nproperties of zeolites, that takes advantage of the influence of the counterions in the \n\nmaterial acidity, the presence of an organic or inorganic template or chemical \n\ntransformations such as dealumination. Combining this workflow with the 2D experiments \n\nallows an easy assessment of the influence of these variables through \n31\n\nP SSNMR \n\nspectroscopy leading to a deeper structural insight of zeolite acidity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n5.2. Future Work \n\n5.2.1. Future NMR studies in TMPO-loaded zeolites \n\nIn addition to the materials used in this work, another material with the same MFI \n\nmorphology but with a pure silica framework, called silicalite, will be used to gain more \n\ninformation about the interaction with TMPO with MFI type materials. Since silicalite has \n\nnone or very low amounts of aluminum atoms, the material framework should lack both \n\nBr\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites. Combining the results from this material with the \n\nmentioned along this work will provide a representation of TMPO interactions with \n\ndifferent frameworks with the same MFI morphology, leading to a better understanding of \n\nzeolites acidic characterization using trialkylphosphine oxides. \n\nSome of the dipole-dipole coupling interactions that are averaged-out with MAS \n\ncan be reintroduced using REDOR-like methods, such as TRAPDOR, REAPDOR, etc. \n\nThese recoupling techniques provide information about the interatomic distances, which \n\ncan be used to support or give more insights to the results reported in this work. The \n\ndifference spectrum (S-S0) in \n1\nH-\n\n31\nP-\n\n27\nAl CP-TRAPDOR experiment, with \n\n27\nAl irradiation \n\nand \n31\n\nP NMR observation, will show only \n31\n\nP resonances from TMPO near aluminum \n\natoms, signals that disappear with \n27\n\nAl irradiation. Thus, allowing the identification of \n\nTMPO molecules adsorbed near aluminum species. \n\nThe distance between FAL and EFAL play a major role in synergic Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis \n\nacid centers, this distance can be estimated using a single quantum-double quantum \n\nexperiment (\n27\n\nAl SQ-DQ). This experiment can also provide information about the \n\nformation of the strong Lewis acid centers observed in a dealuminated sample of ZSM-5. \n\nA similar experiment, \n31\n\nP SQ-DQ NMR, can provide also information about the distance \n\nbetween different TMPO molecules and the formation of (TMPO)2H\n+\n complexes. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Future Modelling studies in TMPO-loaded zeolites \n\nThe results reported in this work showed that some of the most frequently used \n\nfunctionals and basis sets lack in the representation of phosphorous atoms, which leads to \n\ninaccurate results for the determination of \n31\n\nP chemical shielding. In order to obtain better \n\nresults for the \n31\n\nP chemical shift calculations, two main strategies can be used. First, the \n\nuse of NMR oriented functionals, such as Keal and Tozer (KT2 and KT3),\n125\n\n showed better \n\nresults estimating \n31\n\nP chemical shielding calculations and can be tested in these systems.\n123\n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nSecond, a benchmark with several small phosphorous-containing molecules can provide a \n\nlinear scaling that should result in better chemical shift calculations for both TMPO and \n\nTMPO-loaded systems.\n106\n\n  \n\nSeveral papers report that long-range interactions might play a major role in \n\nzeolites acidic properties, therefore, larger clusters should be tested to investigate these \n\nlong-range interactions. Since TMPO occupies a large part of the ZSM -5 pores (Figure \n\n28), it is possible that these small clusters misrepresent the interactions in TMPO-loaded \n\nzeolites. Using these larger models, the influence of aluminum distribution in the different \n\nT sites can be tested, which should provide a better way of mimicking the zeolite acidic \n\nstrength than varying the length of terminal bonds in small clusters. The influence of \n\nEFAL species should also be tested, using large models with EFAL species places near the \n\nprobe molecule. \n\nAnother important aspect that can improve the results for the modelling TMPO interactions \n\nand the \n31\n\nP NMR for TMPO-loaded systems, is using software that is specially designed \n\nfor modelling solid systems, such as Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). \n\n \n\nFigure 28 - Representation from a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5 model showing the volume of the \n\nchannel occupied by the TMPO molecule. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n6.

The mixture was treated at 75\u00baC for 5 hours. Then, the mixture was washed with \n\nca. 10 mL distilled water and dry at ambient temperature. The dried sample was calcined at \n\n550\u00baC for 8 hours with temperature increasing rate of 3\u00baC per minute. Threefold treatment \n\nby HCl was done as follows. The mixture (100 ml of 1 N HCl per gram of HZSM-5) was \n\ntreated 80\u00baC for 1 day, after which the suspension was left to settle. The acid solution was \n\ndecanted, fresh acid solution was added, and the whole procedure was repeated. Finally, \n\nthe suspension was filtrated, and the zeolite was washed thoroughly with water. Samples \n\nwere dried at ambient temperature. Figure S12 shows that the treatment with acetylacetone \n\ndoes not increase the amount of EFAL species. On the other hand, the sample subjected to \n\nstrongly acidic conditions increased slightly the amount of EFAL species. Since the \n\namount of EFAL species generated with these treatments is low, the sample without any \n\ndealumination treatment was selected for additional studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nS10 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure S12 - \n27\n\nAl MAS NMR spectra from three HZSM-5 zeolites synthesized with BTA \n\ntemplate and subjected to different post-synthesis treatments; as-synthesized sample treatment \n\n(green), dealuminated using acetylacetone (red) and dealuminated using HCl (blue)."}]}}}
