By combining three-\n\ndimensional structures (3D) \u2013 scaffolds, autologous cells and growth factors, bone \n\ntissue engineering seeks to achieve a long lasting and fully functional regeneration of \n\nbone. The selected scaffold should be biodegradable, allowing cells to adhere, \n\nproliferate and differentiate into the osteogenic phenotype, producing a mineralized \n\nextracellular matrix (ECM), to be later implanted into the bone defect. The rate of \n\ndegradation of the scaffold should, therefore, be compatible to the rate of neo-tissue \n\ningrowth. \n\n The rationale of the experimental work of this thesis was designed to study a \n\nbone tissue engineering strategy by combining chitosan based scaffolds and human \n\nbone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), aiming bone tissue regeneration. \n\n Blends of chitosan with different types aliphatic polyesters were produced by \n\nextrusion. Afterwards, scaffolds were produced by compression molding followed by \n\nsalt leaching. Several scaffolds formulations were produced and subjected to \n\ncytotoxicity and cytocompatibility tests, allowing selecting the most suitable \n\nformulation in terms of biological response. From the results obtained, the chitosan-\n\npoly(butylene succinate) (PBS) formulation presented the most promising results in in \n\nvitro cell studies with relevant cell lines. To understand why this formulation has \n\nenhanced cell performance, several formulations using different percentages of \n\nchitosan (0, 25 and 50%) and PBS (100, 75 and 50%) were used to produce \n\nscaffolds. The influence of chitosan content was evaluated with hBMSCs in vitro. All \n\nin vitro results evidenced a better performance for the highest chitosan containing \n\nscaffolds, as for cell adhesion and proliferation, as for osteogenic differentiation. \n\nScaffolds containing chitosan (50% chitosan-50% PBS) and without chitosan (100% \n\nPBS) were implanted in different anatomic regions (cranial defect, auricular pocket \n\nand submuscular) of rats. The tissue response was evaluated by studying the \n\ninflammatory response to the implanted scaffolds. Again, scaffolds with higher \n\nchitosan amounts evidenced superior results, with a mild inflammatory response \n\n\n\n xii \n\nwithout cell necrosis, in vivo, as compared to PBS scaffolds, that evidenced tissue \n\nnecrosis in all implantation regions. \n\n A different morphology of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was developed by fiber \n\nbonding to improve the porous structure. These scaffolds were clearly non-cytotoxic \n\nand cytocompatible. Furthermore, chitosan-PBS scaffolds seeded and cultured with \n\nhBMSCs in osteogenic conditions, showed an excellent cell performance. \n\n The biodegradation of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was assessed in vitro using \n\nenzymes responsible for the degradation of chitosan (lysozyme) and PBS (lipase), in \n\nsimilar concentrations to the ones found in human body. The cocktail of both \n\nenzymes induced a superior effect on the scaffolds biodegradation. The in vivo \n\nbiodegradation and biocompatibility of the scaffolds were evaluated. The in vivo \n\nmodel applied to this study was the rat subcutaneous model. Results showed that the \n\nin vivo degradation was much slower than in vitro. The host tissue response was the \n\ntypically associated with biomaterials? implantation, with the presence of foreign body \n\ngiant cells and an inflammatory response that progressed over time. The in vivo \n\nresponse was similar to those observed for biodegradable fixation devices or \n\nbioresorbable sutures. \n\n The final study included in this thesis was performed to confirm the tissue \n\nengineering strategy followed in this work. The potential of chitosan-PBS scaffolds \n\ncombined with hBMSCs, as previously demonstrated, was studied in a relevant \n\nanimal model. A critical size cranial defect in nude mice was used. This model \n\nallowed evaluating the in vivo matured construct using human cells. The results \n\nshowed that constructs were able to promote bone regeneration in a superior level \n\nthan scaffolds without cells. The strategy followed under the scope of this PhD thesis \n\nwas successfully validated in this small animal model, using a combination of \n\nchitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds with hBMSCs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n xiii \n\n \n \nPotencial de c\u00e9lulas estaminais de medula \u00f3ssea associadas a \nscaffolds biodegrad\u00e1veis \u00e0 base de quitosano para engenharia de \ntecido \u00f3sseo. \n \nRESUMO \n A \u00e1rea de engenharia de tecidos \u00f3sseos surgiu como uma alternativa de \n\ntratamento em casos cl\u00ednicos de perdas \u00f3sseas, evitando problemas de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nmorbidez associada a enxertos \u00f3sseos obtidos do pr\u00f3prio paciente. Combinando \n\nestruturas tridimensionais (3D) porosas, c\u00e9lulas aut\u00f3logas e factores de crescimento, \n\na engenharia de tecidos \u00f3sseos visa encontrar solu\u00e7\u00f5es para a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o de osso \n\nneste tipo de pacientes. O suporte 3D seleccionado dever\u00e1 ser biodegrad\u00e1vel, \n\npermitindo a ades\u00e3o, prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica das c\u00e9lulas, de forma \n\na produzir uma matriz extracelular mineralizada, sendo posteriormente implantada \n\nno defeito \u00f3sseo. A taxa de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do suporte 3D poroso dever\u00e1 ser compat\u00edvel \n\ncom a taxa de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido \u00f3sseo. \n\n O objectivo do trabalho experimental desenvolvido nesta tese foi planeado \n\nde forma validar uma estrat\u00e9gia de engenharia de tecidos \u00f3sseos, atrav\u00e9s da \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes 3D porosos biodegrad\u00e1veis \u00e0 base de quitosano e c\u00e9lulas \n\nestaminais adultas de origem humana obtidas a partir de medula \u00f3ssea.  \n\n Neste trabalho foram produzidas v\u00e1rias misturas de quitosano com \n\ndiferentes tipos de poli\u00e9steres alif\u00e1ticos usando a t\u00e9cnica de extrus\u00e3o. Usando estas \n\nmisturas desenvolveram-se suportes tridimensionais que foram processados por \n\nmolda\u00e7\u00e3o por compress\u00e3o com part\u00edculas de sacrif\u00edcio de sal. As misturas \n\nproduzidas foram avaliadas em termos de citotoxicidade e citocompatibilidade. Desta \n\nforma, foi poss\u00edvel seleccionar a formula\u00e7\u00e3o mais adequada em termos de resposta \n\nbiol\u00f3gica. A formula\u00e7\u00e3o de quitosano e polibutileno succinato (PBS) foi a formula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nseleccionada para posterior desenvolvimento da estrat\u00e9gia de engenharia de \n\ntecidos. Por ter tido consistentemente os melhores resultados biol\u00f3gicos in vitro, a \n\nmistura seleccionada foi usada para produzir suportes porosos contendo diferentes \n\npercentagens de quitosano (0, 25 and 50%) e PBS, de forma a estudar a import\u00e2ncia \n\ndo quitosano nas formula\u00e7\u00f5es. A influ\u00eancia da percentagem de quitosano nos \n\nsuportes porosos foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s de estudos in vitro com culturas prim\u00e1rias de \n\n\n\n xiv \n\nc\u00e9lulas estaminais mesenquimais de origem humana. Os resultados celulares \n\nobtidos mostraram um melhor desempenho em termos de ades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nassim como na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica das c\u00e9lulas nos suportes 3D com maior \n\npercentagem de quitosano. Tendo-se observado uma maior efic\u00e1cia no desempenho \n\nbiol\u00f3gico dos suportes porosos contendo quitosano, interessava confirmar estes \n\nresultados in vivo, tendo como controlo suportes sem quitosano, s\u00f3 com PBS. \n\nSuportes porosos sem quitosano e com quitosano (50%), uma vez que foram \n\naqueles para os quais se obteve o pior e o melhor comportamento celular in vivo \n\nrespectivamente, foram implantados em diferentes regi\u00f5es anat\u00f3micas (defeito \n\ncraniano, implanta\u00e7\u00e3o auricular e submuscular) em ratos. A resposta inflamat\u00f3ria foi \n\navaliada, tendo os suportes porosos com quitosano evidenciado uma resposta \n\ninflamat\u00f3ria moderada, n\u00e3o se observando necrose celular. Suportes porosos com \n\napenas PBS na sua constitui\u00e7\u00e3o, mostraram necrose celular em todos os locais \n\nanat\u00f3micos implantados.  \n\n O passo seguinte passou por optimizar a morfologia  dos suportes, tendo \n\nsido neste caso desenvolvida uma estrutura porosa de malha de fibras de quitosano \n\ne PBS, por compress\u00e3o a quente. Estes suportes porosos foram avaliados e \n\nconfirmou-se tamb\u00e9m que n\u00e3o eram citot\u00f3xicos e que eram citocompat\u00edveis. \n\nAdicionalmente, foram cultivadas c\u00e9lulas prim\u00e1rias humanas de medula \u00f3ssea \n\nnestas estruturas tridimensionais, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica, \n\nmostrando um excelente desempenho in vitro. A biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o destes suportes \n\nporosos de quitosano-PBS foi estudada usando enzimas respons\u00e1veis pela \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do quitosano (lisozima) e PBS (lipase) em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es id\u00eanticas \u00e0s \n\nencontradas no corpo humano. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que um cocktail \n\ndas duas enzimas teve um efeito pronunciado no que respeita \u00e0 taxa de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos suportes porosos. O estudo foi complementado pela an\u00e1lise da biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nbiocompatibilidade dos suportes tridimensionais in vivo. O modelo in vivo escolhido \n\npara este estudo foi o implante subcut\u00e2neo em ratos. Os resultados obtidos \n\nmostraram que a taxa de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o in vivo foi consideravelmente menor \n\ncomparativamente com os estudos efectuados in vitro. A resposta in vivo foi \n\nsemelhante \u00e0 observada em implantes de placas de fixa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea biodegrad\u00e1veis \n\nou em suturas bioabsorv\u00edveis.  \n\n O \u00faltimo estudo inclu\u00eddo nesta tese foi realizado para confirmar a estrat\u00e9gia \n\nde engenharia de tecidos proposta neste trabalho: a associa\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes porosos \n\nbiodegrad\u00e1veis de quitosano e PBS e c\u00e9lulas estaminais humanas de medula \u00f3ssea \n\n\n\n xv \n\ndiferenciadas para a linhagem osteog\u00e9nica. O potencial desta estrat\u00e9gia foi \n\nestudado num modelo animal relevante: um defeito craniano de tamanho cr\u00edtico em \n\nratinhos imunocomprometidos. Este modelo permitiu avaliar o efeito da implanta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos suportes porosos cultivados com c\u00e9lulas humanas naqueles defeitos \u00f3sseos. Os \n\nresultados obtidos mostraram que esta associa\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes porosos de \n\nquitosano-PBS com c\u00e9lulas humanas pr\u00e9-cultivados in vitro em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nosteog\u00e9nicas, promoveram regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea de uma forma mais significativa \n\nquando comparados com suportes porosos implantados sem c\u00e9lulas. A estrat\u00e9gia de \n\nengenharia de tecidos seguida no \u00e2mbito desta tese de doutoramento, atrav\u00e9s da \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes porosos de quitosano-PBS e c\u00e9lulas estaminais humanas \n\nde medula \u00f3ssea foi validada com sucesso neste modelo animal de pequeno porte.\n\n\n\n xvi \n\n\n\n xvii \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nAcknowledgements vii \n\nAbstract xi \n\nResumo xiii \n\nTable of contents xvii \n\nList of abbreviations xxvii \n\nList of figures xxxiv \n\nList of tables xlii \n\nShort curriculum vitae xliv \n\nList of publications xlv \n\nStructure of the thesis l \n\n  \nSECTION 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I  \n\nINTRODUCTION \nChitosan based scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n \n\nAbstract 5 \n\n1.

The structure of the thesis was adopted having in mind the \n\nfinal objective of this PhD research, leading to a successful bone tissue engineering \n\nstrategy. The experimental part was divided in 3 sections, 3, 4 and 5. In each of \n\nthese sections it is described each one of the phases of the work developed in this \n\nthesis. The contents of each section are summarized below. \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION 1 (Chapter I) \n\n Chapter I is based on a review paper, presenting an overview on bone tissue \nengineering using chitosan based scaffolds. Bone biology is briefly analyzed to clarify \n\nthe role of the various components required to achieve a successful bone tissue \n\nengineering strategy. These components are discussed in detail, covering from the \n\ntype of scaffold to the in vivo proof of concept. The choice of cells, type of biomaterial \n\nused to produce the scaffold and its in vivo validation, as well as the type of animal \n\nmodels are also presented. In all these aspects, a special attention was given to \n\nchitosan as a suitable biomaterial to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. It \n\nis also included a review of the literature on the different types of chitosan processing \n\nmethodologies. The review also discusses the reports in vitro and in vivo on bone \n\ntissue engineering strategies using chitosan. \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION 2 (Chapter II) \n Chapter II presents the materials and experimental procedures used in the \n\npresent thesis. This chapter contains additional information about the experimental \n\nmethods used in the various chapters of the thesis. Furthermore, it aims also at \n\nproviding a general framework for the testing of new tissue engineering strategies in \n\na comprehensive and structured way.  \n\n \n \n\nSECTION 3 (Chapters III and IV)  \n\n Chapter III describes the in vitro testing of scaffolds produced with various \nchitosan-polyester formulations (PBS, PCL and PBTA) using in all cases the same \n\n\n\n xlviii \n\npercentage of chitosan (50% wt). The scaffolds were processed by compression \n\nmolding and particulate leaching. The eventual cytotoxicity of extracts from the \n\nscaffolds is evaluated with a L929 cell line. This chapter also presents the results of \n\nthe first biological evaluation of these scaffolds, by using a mouse MSC cell line \n\n(BMC9) to select the most adequate scaffold formulation for bone tissue engineered \n\napplications. These in vitro results evidenced a superior performance for chitosan-\n\npoly(butylene succinate) scaffolds. The next step aimed at clarifying why this specific \n\nscaffold formulation evidenced a superior cell performance. \n \n\n Chapter IV presents further in vitro studies using primary cultures of human \n\nMSCs differentiated into the osteogenic lineage on scaffolds produced with different \n\nchitosan percentages (0, 25 and 50%). The in vitro results allowed concluding that \n\nchitosan containing scaffolds have stronger biological performance than 100% PBS \n\nscaffolds. This work also reports an experimental design to assess the in vivo effect \n\nof the chitosan, by implanting the scaffolds without and with 50% chitosan. The trend \n\nalready observed in vitro was further confirmed in vivo, showing that the chitosan \n\ncontaining scaffolds elicit a milder inflammatory response and no signs of tissue \n\nnecrosis when compared with scaffolds of PBS (without chitosan). \n \n\n \n\nSECTION 4 (Chapters V and VI) \n Chapter V reports the results of the in vitro testing of scaffolds produced by \n\nfiber bonding, with an optimized porous morphology and with the formulation having \n\nthe strongest performance in previous experiments (chitosan-PBS 50% wt). These \n\nscaffolds have enhanced porosity and interconnectivity, facilitating the cell ingrowth. \n\nIn fact, the previous in vitro results obtained in chapter IV evidenced some difficulty of \n\nthe cells to penetrate the porous structure of the scaffolds produced by compression \n\nmolding/salt leaching. The results obtained in vitro using human MSCs differentiated \n\ninto the osteogenic lineage evidenced a superior cell ingrowth throughout the entire \n\nscaffolds structure. This evidence showed that the optimized morphology indeed was \n\nable to facilitate the cell migration into the porous structure of the scaffold. \n\n  \n\n Chapter VI reports the results of the study of the biodegradation of the \n\nscaffolds previously tested in chapter V, both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies \n\nwere intended to model the degradation in vivo, using specific enzymes. The \n\n\n\n xlix \n\nselected enzymes (lysozyme and lipase) are known to degrade the two polymers \n\nused to produce the scaffolds. The concentrations of enzymes used in vitro were \n\nsimilar to those found in the human serum, to predict the degradation of the \n\ndeveloped scaffolds. The in vivo analysis was performed to assess the \n\nbiodegradation of the scaffolds and to compare its kinetics with the one obtained in \n\nthe in vitro results. Furthermore, it was also evaluated the tissue response to the \n\nimplantation of the new scaffold morphology, comparing the inflammatory response \n\nwith the one previously obtained for the scaffolds with similar composition but with \n\ndifferent porous morphology. \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION 5 (Chapter VII) \n\n Chapter VII describes the in vivo validation of the tissue engineering strategy \nproposed in this thesis. After studying the in vitro performance and the in vivo tissue \n\nresponse of the developed scaffolds, in the context of bone tissue engineering, it was \n\nnecessary to demonstrate if the strategy would be effective in a relevant in vivo \n\nmodel. For that, it was used an orthotopic model in the calvaria of nude mice to verify \n\nif pre-cultured human bone MSCs on chitosan-PBS scaffolds were able to stimulate \n\nbone regeneration in vivo. The scaffolds used in this model were produced by \n\ncompression molding and salt leaching, being the preferred morphology enabling \n\nproducing a scaffold with the geometry required to fit into the bone defect used.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION 6 (Chapter VIII) \n Chapter VIII contains the general conclusions and final remarks regarding \n\nthe series of studies performed under the scope of this thesis. It is intended to \n\nprovide a general summing up of the conclusions extracted in the various sections \n\nand allowing a complete analysis of the progress obtained in the framework of this \n\nthesis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n SECTION 1\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\nChitosan based scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Costa-Pinto AR, Reis RL, Neves NM. \u201cChitosan based \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications\u201d 2010; Submitted. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 5\u00a0\n\nCHAPTER I \nINTRODUCTION \n \nABSTRACT \n\n As life expectancy increases, malfunction or loss of tissue caused by injury or disease \n\nleads to reduced quality of life in many patients at significant socio-economic cost. Even \n\nthough major progresses have been made in the field of bone tissue engineering during the \n\nlast few years, current therapies such as bone grafts still have limitations. Current research \n\non biodegradable polymers is emerging, combining these structures with osteogenic cells, as \n\nan alternative to autologous bone grafts.  \n\n Different types of biodegradable materials have been proposed to be used as three-\n\ndimensional (3D) porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Among them, natural \n\npolymers are one of the most attractive options, mainly due to their similarities with \n\nextracellular matrix (ECM), chemical versatility, good biological performance and inherent \n\ncellular interactions. In this review, special attention is given to chitosan as a biomaterial for \n\nbone tissue engineering. An extensive literature survey was performed about the processing \n\nof chitosan scaffolds and its biological performance in vitro as well as its in vivo bone \n\nregeneration potential.  \n\n The present review also aims to offer the reader a general overview on all \ncomponents needed to engineer new bone tissue, giving a brief background on bone biology, \n\nfollowed by an explanation of all components in bone tissue engineering, as well as \n\ndescribing different tissue engineering strategies. Moreover, it will be exploited the typical \n\nmodel to evaluate the in vitro functionality of a tissue engineered construct and the in vivo \n\nmodels to assess the potential to regenerate bone tissue.  \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n Bone tissue, when injured, leads to dramatic changes in the quality of life of patients. \n\nIt can limit the ability to perform basic tasks, such as walking and frequently causes social \n\nand psychological problems. The current clinical available solutions for these problems rely \n\non bone graft transplants (autologous, allogenous and xenogenic), bone transport methods \n\n(Ilizarov technique) and implants based on different types of materials. More than 2.2 million \n\nbone graft procedures (autologous bone graft and banked bone) take place annually \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 6\u00a0\n\nworldwide (1, 2). Those procedures ensure adequate bone healing in many skeletal \n\nproblems, such as non-union fractures, cervical and lumbar spine fusion, joint arthrodesis or \n\nrevision arthroplasty. Bone grafting is a strong and mature business generating sales of more \n\nthan $2.5 billion a year (3). Autografts are considered the gold standard for bone repair. \n\nHowever, some complications may occur, such as bone non-unions and blood loss, which \n\nincreases the need for blood transfusions (4-7). Moreover, besides being an expensive \n\nprocedure, there is a limited supply of tissue and it causes significant donor site morbidity (6, \n\n8). Allografts are typically non-vital (dead) bone harvested from a cadaver and then \n\nprocessed using a freeze-drying method that extracts all the water via a vacuum drying \n\nprocess. These type of grafts avoid donor site morbidity, but present a potential risk for \n\ndisease transmission and severe immune response by the patient (9). Similar to allogeneic \n\nbone, xenogenic bone is non-vital bone derived from other species, mainly from bovine \n\norigin. Because the potential for immune rejection and contamination by viral proteins is \n\nhigher in bovine bone than in human cadaver bone, xenograft material is processed at very \n\nhigh temperatures. The Ilizarov methodology consists of an osteotomy followed by bone \n\ndistraction by extendable fixation devices. This technique avoids problems related with the \n\nosteointegration of bone grafts, but requires longer periods of treatment (12-18 months) and \n\ncan be quite painful for the patient (10). The aforementioned limitations justify the need to \n\ndevelop new therapies using alternative concepts that are currently the focus of intense \n\nresearch efforts. \n\n Bone has a notable regenerative ability but a considerable amount of bone loss or the \n\ndevelopment of an adverse microenvironment can hinder this capacity, such in cases of \n\nsevere trauma, developmental deformities, revision surgeries and tumor resection (11, 12). In \n\nthese cases, bone tissue engineering holds the promise of great therapeutic potential (13). \n\nBone tissue engineering may constitute the needed breakthrough technology to solve the \n\nproblem of bone shortage in various destructive clinical conditions and deformities, by \n\nproviding functional tissue engineered biological substitutes (14). The most promising \n\nstrategy used in this field is based on the seeding and in vitro culture of primary osteoblasts \n\nor adult stem cells, differentiated into the osteogenic phenotype on three-dimensional (3D) \n\nscaffolds (synthetic, natural or ceramics). These constructs will be further implanted into a \n\nbone defect. The cells will synthesize the ECM of the new bone tissue, while the scaffold will \n\nprovide the adequate 3D environment for the cells to adhere, proliferate and differentiate. \n\nThe scaffolds will be not only temporary 3D supports for the cells to create new bone, but \n\nalso space filling and local controlled release devices of signaling molecules. To accomplish \n\nall these goals, the scaffold should meet stringent requirements, such as biodegradability at \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 7\u00a0\n\nsuch rate that is compatible to the rate of new tissue formation. Other important properties \n\ninclude the biocompatibility with host tissues, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity, \n\nappropriate mechanical properties, adequate porosity and morphology (15-17). All these \n\nproperties are essential to facilitate and guide cell ingrowth, transport of gases, metabolites, \n\nnutrients and signaling molecules, both within the scaffold and between the scaffold and the \n\nnative local environment. \n\n The selection of the most suitable material to produce a scaffold to be used in bone \n\ntissue engineering applications is a determinant step, since its properties will determine its \n\nfinal characteristics. Biodegradable polymers, either synthetic or natural, are the most \n\nappropriate substrates for the cells to attach, grow and maintain a differentiated phenotype. \n\nIn the last years, natural origin polymers have been increasingly proposed for the referred \n\napplication. In our group, we have been working with natural based polymers, such as starch \n\n(18-22), chitosan (23-27), gellan gum (28-31), soy (32) or silk (33, 34). Our strategy is to \n\nmimic nature and, for that, we have been using those polymers to design functional \n\nmicroenvironments stimulating tissue morphogenesis. In particular, chitosan has shown an \n\nexcellent combination of properties and it has been demonstrated that it is a suitable \n\nbiomaterial to develop scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Chitosan can be used either \n\nalone (23, 35-41) or in combination with other biodegradable polymers, such as aliphatic \n\npolyesters (25, 42-47), other natural polymers such as starch (26, 48, 49) or silk (50, 51), or \n\nwith ceramics, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) (24, 52-60). \n\n This manuscript aims to provide an overview of the most important concepts in bone \n\ntissue engineering and a review on chitosan based scaffolds proposed in the literature to \n\nregenerate bone tissue. The potential of this biomaterial as a suitable substrate to support \n\nosteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will also be explored. \n\n \n\n2. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF BONE BIOLOGY \n\n Bone is a dynamic and complex tissue evolving and adapting to various stimuli \n\nthroughout the entire lifetime (61). It plays crucial roles in both mechanical support and \n\nmineral homeostasis (62). Within a skeletal element, there are different morphologies of \n\nbone, such as cortical and trabecular bone. Cortical bone is a compact structural tissue, with \n\nonly 10% porosity, being 80% of the mass of an adult human skeleton. Trabecular bone is a \n\nspongy structure with 50-90% porosity, filled with bone marrow. The majority of bones are \n\ncovered by a highly vascularized fibrous connective tissue, the periosteum (63). Five different \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 8\u00a0\n\ncell types are involved in bone maintenance and remodeling: MSCs, bone-lining cells, \n\nosteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Within the bone structure, MSCs are found in the \n\nbone marrow (64-67) and also in the periosteum (68). The bone marrow is composed of \n\nhematopoietic tissue and the supporting stroma (69). Marrow stromal cells, originally thought \n\nto only contribute to the hematopoietic microenvironment, later came to the center stage with \n\nthe recognition of being the stem/progenitor cells of skeletal tissues (65). Human autologous \n\nbone marrow associated with macroporous hydroxyapatite scaffolds were implanted in large \n\nbone segmental defects and shown to promote bone regeneration (70). After a 7 years follow \n\nup (71), the patients presented a complete healing of the defects. Bone-lining cells are flat \n\ncells that cover all bone surfaces and are believed to have origin from osteoblasts that \n\nbecome inactive (72, 73). These cells form an important cellular barrier that divides the \n\ncanalicular network (where osteocytes are present) from other fluids (63). Osteoblasts are \n\ncells derived from MSCs that synthesize the osteoid (non-mineralized organic matrix of the \n\nbone, i.e. type I collagen, osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialoproteins and bone \n\nmorphogenetic proteins) (74). Osteoblasts also have an active role in the vascularization \n\nprocess by secreting morphogens that activate angiogenesis by signaling endothelial cells \n\n(75-77). Osteocytes are terminally differentiated osteoblasts entrapped within the bone ECM, \n\nthat are involved in the maintenance of ECM and calcium homeostasis (63). Osteocytes are \n\nalso the cells sensing mechanical stress and communicating signals for bone remodeling \n\nand tissue maintenance (78). The fifth cell type is the osteoclast, responsible for bone \n\nresorption that is the first stage of the bone remodeling process, followed by bone \n\nhomeostasis. These cells are large multinucleated cells differentiated from a fraction of \n\nmonocytes found in the peripheral blood (63).  \n\n As many other connective tissues, one of the main components of bone is its ECM, \n\nthat in this case is mineralized. Bone ECM is composed of 35% of organic matrix and 65% of \n\nmineral matrix. The most abundant mineral in bone ECM is HA, a calcium phosphate \n\ncrystallized at the surface of collagen fibrils, required to resist to bending and compression \n\nstresses (61). The organic matrix is mainly proteic composed of type I collagen (90%) and \n\nthe remaining fraction includes up to 200 other non-collagenous proteins, such as \n\nglycoproteins, proteoglycans, integrin-binding proteins and growth factors (61). \n\n Bones are developed by two main processes: intramembranous and endochondral \n\nossification (79, 80). Intramembranous ossification is a process that generates flat bones and \n\nthe skull structure. In this pathway, the embryonic mesenchyme condenses and develops in \n\nprimary ossification centers, which will eventually fuse to form a network of anastomosing \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 9\u00a0\n\ninterconnected trabeculae made of woven bone (79). After that, periosteum is formed at the \n\nsurface of trabeculae, further mineralized and part of the intertrabecular connective tissue is \n\ntransformed in hematopoietic tissue (80). Finally, the woven bone is remodeled into a \n\nlamellar type of bone (81). Endochondral ossification is an osteogenic process through which \n\nlong bones, vertebrae and pelvis are generated from their precursor cartilaginous tissue. \n\n(82). This process starts in the fetus stage where MSCs differentiate into chondrocytes, \n\nconverting the condensed mesenchyme into a cartilaginous model of bone that will expand in \n\nits extremities, while becoming hypertrophic in the center. These hypertrophic chondrocytes \n\nwill promote primary ossification by secreting molecules (such as alkaline phosphatase, type \n\nX collagen or vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGF) that will induce calcification of \n\ncartilage. This tissue will be resorbed, becoming a structure onto which progenitor cells \n\ndifferentiate into osteoblasts that start to deposit osteoids. After birth, the secondary \n\nossification centers are developed at the extremity of long bones allowing the development \n\nand growth of bone structure (81). \n\n \n\n3. BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES \n\n Bone has an intrinsic self-ability to regenerate, but over a large defect, inherent \n\nosseous processes are not able to repair the defect during the patient\u00b4s lifetime (83). \n\nFurthermore, diseased bones do not heal properly, and under certain pathological conditions \n\nstart damaging themselves (83-85). Tissue engineering has emerged as a possible solution \n\nfor these clinical conditions. Several strategies can be employed to develop new bone tissue. \n\nThose strategies may involve the use of an ECM-like structure (scaffold), cells, and/or growth \n\nfactors. These three basic components need to be well synchronized in order to achieve a \n\nsuccessful tissue engineering therapy. The strategy used for a specific bone defect must be \n\nadapted to the clinical state of the patient. There are three main approaches originally \n\ndescribed for tissue engineering: 1) to use engineered matrices alone, in order to guide \n\ntissue regeneration; 2) to inject autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic cells alone; 3) to \n\ndevelop constructs of cells seeded on those matrices (14). The first method involves \n\nimplanting the scaffold at the site of interest, allowing host cells to migrate from the \n\nsurrounding tissues to colonize the scaffold. The second strategy has the advantage of \n\ninvolving minimal surgical invasion and cells can be manipulated by recombinant gene \n\ntechnology or clonal expansion prior to injection or infusion. However, this methodology has \n\nlimitations for bone critical size defects, due to the absence of the supporting matrix to keep \n\ncells at the defect site. In the last approach, cells are seeded onto scaffolds (construct) and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 10\u00a0\n\nlater implanted into the bone defect. Usually constructs are produced ex vivo prior to \n\ntransplantation to a bone defect and over time cells will synthesize a new ECM, as the \n\nscaffold degrades, creating a new functional tissue. This review will focus on the third tissue \n\nengineering strategy, exploring the potential use of autologous stem cells cultured onto \n\nbiodegradable scaffolds that will act as extracellular matrices, supporting cell growth and \n\ntissue development.  \n\n \n\n4. NATURAL BASED POLYMERS FOR SCAFFOLD DESIGN  \n\n Nature offers a remarkable set of materials with great potential to be used in different \n\nfields. The study and use of natural materials comes from ancient times, such as cellulose, \n\nthat is used to produce paper or silk to produce clothes. In medicine for example, chitosan is \n\nused as wound dressing material and collagen as a substitute in reconstructive surgery. \n\nToday, powerful tools are available and the micro and nanostructures of these materials were \n\nalready clarified. The new level of knowledge brought new opportunities to develop materials \n\nfor other applications, such as scaffolds for tissue engineering. Great efforts have been made \n\nto recapitulate the key features of bone ECM by developing structures that mimic this \n\nnaturally occurring matrix. ECM plays an important role over cell activities, modulating their \n\nbehavior (86). One difficulty in developing such scaffolds is the complexity to recreate a \n\nsimilar microenvironment to the tissue of interest. A simple approach to mimic nature is to \n\nuse naturally occurring materials. Moreover, natural polymers have different functions, such \n\nas the role of polysaccharides in the cell membranes, intracellular communication and \n\nstorage, or proteins that are structural materials and catalysts (enzymes) (87). Natural \n\npolymers such as starch (18-20, 22, 88-90) or chitosan (91-94) have been described as \n\nbiocompatible, biodegradable and having tailored degradation rate (88, 92). Some \n\ndrawbacks of these biomaterials are the limited mechanical properties and processability or \n\nvariability between different batches (15). Examples of natural polymers commonly used to \n\nproduce scaffolds are collagen (95-99), hyaluronan (100, 101), alginate (102), silk (50, 103, \n\n104) and chitosan (23, 37, 41). These polymers can be combined with other synthetic \n\nmaterials, to improve their processability and mechanical properties. Combinations with HA \n\n(105), aliphatic polyesters (25, 27, 106, 107) or composites of different natural polymers (26, \n\n48) have also been described. Herein a special focus will be given to the natural \n\npolysaccharide chitosan, the deacetylated product of chitin obtained from the exoskeleton of \n\ncrustaceans. \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 11\u00a0\n\n5. CHITOSAN AS A NATURAL ORIGIN BIOPOLYMER \n\n The history of chitosan dates back from the 19th century when Rouget discussed its \n\ndeacetylated form (108). Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide, obtained from the deacetylation \n\nof chitin, the primary structural polymer of the exoskeleton of crustaceans, cuticles of insects \n\nand cell wall of fungi (109, 110). Chitosan is composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl \n\nglucosamine with ? (1-4) link (111). Chitosan is the common name for the family of \n\ndeacetylated chitins, with different degrees of deacetylation. By definition, when the number \n\nof N-acetyl glucosamine units is higher than 50%, the polymer is considered chitin. On the \n\nother hand, when the number of N-glucosamine units is superior, its name is chitosan (112). \n\nThe molecular weight of chitosan may range from 300 to more than 1,000 kDa, depending on \n\nits origin and on the preparation method (35). The solubility of chitosan depends on the free \n\namino and N-acetyl groups, being soluble in acidic pH (35). The cationic nature of chitosan \n\nallows electrostatic interactions with anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans. \n\nNatural polymers are known to influence cell morphology, modulation and differentiation \n\n(113, 114), as referred previously. This property is of crucial importance in tissue engineering \n\nfield, because GAGs molecules modulate the action of several cytokines and growth factors \n\n(115).  \n\n Chitosan presents a wide range of properties that makes it suitable for tissue \n\nengineering applications, namely its biodegradability (91, 116, 117), biocompatibility (93, 94, \n\n118-120), antibacterial activity (121-123), wound healing properties (124-130) and easy \n\naccessibility.  \n\n Chitosan can be hydrolyzed by chitosanases (131), which are absent in mammals. It \n\nis well documented that lysozyme is responsible for the biodegradation of chitosan in vitro \n\n(91, 92, 132, 133). The degradation rate of chitosan is inversely related to the degree of \n\ndeacetylation (132), which represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units to the \n\ntotal number of units (131). Lysozyme is ubiquitous in the human body (134). It is found in \n\nlacrimal gland, middle ear, nose, bronchus, bronchiole, bone marrow and digestive tract \n\n(135). Lysozyme has an important role in inflammatory response, being secreted by \n\nmacrophages, monocytes, and granulocytes (136, 137). Monocytes and macrophages are \n\nthe main contributors to the presence of lysozyme in human serum in concentrations \n\nbetween 7 and 13 mg/L (134).  \n\n Chitosan has intrinsic anti-microbial properties against several microorganisms, \n\nnamely fungi and bacteria (138). The accurate mechanism is still unknown, although its \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 12\u00a0\n\ncationic nature associates with anions in bacteria cell wall, suppressing biosynthesis and \n\nalso disrupting the mass transport across the cell wall, leading to the death of bacteria (138). \n\n  Chitosan has been described as a potent wound healing accelerator (139), and to \n\npossess immunological activity, by activating macrophages (140), to produce cytokines (141) \n\nand to inhibit infection (142).  \n\n One of the most important characteristics of chitosan, for tissue engineering \n\napplications, is its ability to be shaped into various structures, such as microspheres (143), \n\npaste (144), membranes (113), sponges (37, 145-148), fibers (27, 38, 149) and porous \n\nscaffolds (25, 27, 56, 150, 151). Several processing methodologies have been used to \n\nproduce chitosan porous scaffolds and will be herein further discussed in detail. \n\nNevertheless, before describing the scaffolds processing techniques, it is important to \n\nunderline the properties that a scaffold must possess to be successfully applied in bone \n\ntissue engineering applications. \n\n \n\n6. SCAFFOLD REQUIREMENTS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING \n\n Bone is a 3D tissue and cells alone do not grow in a 3D manner in vitro. For that \n\nreason, a tridimensional structure is required to support the formation of new functional bone \n\ntissue. This structure should provide a suitable environment for cell attachment, proliferation, \n\ndifferentiation and ECM deposition. The in vitro cultured constructs, when implanted into the \n\ndefect must be vascularized and osteointegrated into the host bone (152). The 3D structures \n\nshould be biocompatible, i.e., not evoking an immune response when implanted in the host \n\ntissue. When a scaffold is implanted into the defect to restore bone functionality, it should \n\nactivate the healing mechanisms (inflammatory response). The time course of healing is \n\ninfluenced by interactions between blood, scaffold surface and degradation products, which \n\nare released from the scaffold and therefore, influencing biocompatibility. The ideal scaffold \n\nshould degrade in a rate compatible with the rate of bone growth, physically creating open \n\nspace for the new bone formation, until full regeneration is achieved. The process of polymer \n\ndegradation follows the mechanisms through which polymer chains are cleaved into \n\noligomers and finally to monomers, that can be metabolized by natural mechanisms (153). If \n\na biological process mediates the degradation process, it is designated by biodegradation \n\n(153). Several factors influence the kinetics of degradation: type of chemical bonds, pH, \n\npolymer composition, crystallinity, molecular weight, porosity, water uptake and anatomical \n\nlocation of the implant (153). Ideally, natural pathways of the animal body should eliminate \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 13\u00a0\n\nthe degradation products. \n\n As previously discussed, bone is a highly vascularized tissue, relying on the \n\ninteractions between bone cells and blood vessels. In this way, angiogenesis and \n\nneovascularization play a crucial role in bone repair, and should be taken into account when \n\ndesigning a scaffold. Angiogenesis is mainly characterized by the protrusion and outgrowth \n\nof capillary buds and sprouts from pre-existing blood vessels, while neovascularization \n\ncomprises the formation of functional microvascular networks with red blood cell perfusion \n\n(154). Both processes are required to ensure successful engraftment of the construct into the \n\nsurrounding host tissue. A vascular network can be included in a biodegradable and \n\nbiocompatible scaffold by microfabrication techniques (155). The main property of the \n\nscaffold that is directly related to vascularization is its porosity (156). Scaffolds should have \n\nhighly interconnected porosity to promote cell ingrowth and distribution throughout the matrix, \n\nas well as facilitating the development of neovascularization. The minimum pore size is \n\nconsidered to be approximately 100-150 ?m (157), due to cell size, migration requirements \n\nand fluid transport. However, due to vascularization requirement, pore sizes were shown to \n\naffect the course of osteogenesis (156). Large pores rapidly become well-vascularized \n\nleading to direct osteogenesis (158, 159). In contrast, small pores lead to hypoxic conditions, \n\nwhich tend to induce the development of osteochondral process, before osteogenesis \n\noccurs. The porosity strongly influences scaffold mechanical properties. High porosity and \n\npore size facilitates tissue ingrowth, but the consequence is a drastic reduction of mechanical \n\nproperties, compromising the structural integrity of the scaffold (160). The mechanical \n\nproperties of a scaffold should be compatible with those of the native tissue, maintaining its \n\nstructural integrity after implantation (161). In general, the scaffold should be strong enough \n\nto not only resist to stresses that may cause important dimensional changes, but also to \n\novercome the contraction that will exist during the in vivo tissue healing. Scaffold integrity is \n\ncritical, since cells and tissue remodeling are important to achieve stable biomechanical \n\nenvironment and vascularization at the host site. The topography and surface chemistry of \n\nthe scaffold play a crucial role in its performance, since those are the first elements that cells \n\nrecognize when in contact with the scaffold surface. The type of proteins that will adsorb to \n\nthe surface of the material, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity will modulate to a great extent the \n\nprotein adsorption, which will influence cell activity upon seeding (162).  \n\n The methodology used to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering must not \n\nadversely affect biocompatibility or physical and chemical properties of the biomaterials used. \n\nDifferent scaffold batches should exhibit minor variations in their properties, when processed \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 14\u00a0\n\nwith similar processing parameters and conditions (163). Different processing methodologies \n\nfor chitosan based scaffolds were already reported in the literature and will be further \n\ndiscussed in detail.  \n\n \n\n7. CHITOSAN SCAFFOLDING METHODOLOGIES \n\n The most common processing methodology described for chitosan scaffolds is \n\nfreeze-drying. This process consists in the lyophilization of a frozen chitosan solution, where \n\nthe chitosan acetate salt is induced by the freezing conditions to phase-separate from the ice \n\ncrystal phase. The ice phase is further sublimated, producing a porous structure (24, 35, 37, \n\n51, 56, 148, 151, 160, 164-175). In most cases, the scaffolds can still have chitosan acetate \n\nthat will cause fast swelling and subsequently dissolution in a neutral aqueous medium. This \n\ncan be overcomed by crosslinking upon immersion in sodium hydroxide (35, 169), sodium \n\nsulfate (38), tripolyphosphate (37, 148), ethanol series (35), or with a combination of \n\ncrosslinking with rehydration (164). The freeze-drying technique requires a very tight control \n\nof the temperature. If the temperature is not sufficiently low, the matrix will not become rigid \n\nenough to support the interfacial tension caused by the evaporation of the solvent without \n\ncollapsing, creating a surface skin. Another limitation of the structures produced by this \n\ntechnique is that the size of the pores is not very large. Also the mechanical properties of the \n\nporous structures are very limited, even after cross-linking. Due to the susceptibility of freeze-\n\ndrying methodology, solvent exchange phase separation has been proposed as an \n\nalternative methodology. This technique is based in the gelation of a solution of chitosan \n\nusing an alkaline solution below its gelation point (26, 36, 53, 176). In freeze-drying process, \n\nthe choice of the solvent is limited, since the solvent vapor pressure at the drying \n\ntemperature (usually low) must be high enough to allow its removal (36). With this alternative \n\nmethod, less time consuming and more economic, the choice of the solvent is wider (36).  \n\n Another processing methodology of chitosan is wet spinning, allowing producing \n\nfibers. Due to the strong inter-chain forces derived from the hydroxyl and amino groups, \n\nchitosan tends to degrade at temperatures below its melting temperature, limiting its \n\nprocessability by melt or dry spinning methods (38, 41, 149, 177-179). Basically, chitosan is \n\ndissolved in a solution of diluted acetic acid. This solution is spun through a spinneret into a \n\ncoagulation bath, in this way producing fibers. Chitosan can also be processed by \n\nelectrospinning into a nanofiber mesh scaffold. This method uses an electrical field created \n\nbetween a collector and a capillary connected to a reservoir with the polymer solution. The \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 15\u00a0\n\nelongation of the drop of solution caused by the electrical field leads to the formation of very \n\nthin fibers with nanometer scale diameters. Electrospinning of pure chitosan (39, 180-183) is \n\nconsidered to be quite difficult, since the resulting chitosan salt is soluble in water. Its stability \n\nin solution requires neutralization or crosslinking in a post-processing stage that frequently \n\nhas an impact in the morphology of the mesh. Several studies report the blending of chitosan \n\nwith other polymers, being easier to process by electrospinning, namely silk fibroin (184), \n\npoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (185, 186), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (187), collagen (188) or \n\npolycaprolactone (189).  \n\n Less conventional is the particle aggregation method (Figure 1) proposed by \n\nMalafaya et al. (23). This process relies on the bioadhesive character of chitosan that confers \n\na strong bonding between individual particles. The scaffolds produced by this method have \n\nshown very interesting mechanical properties. In another study, chitosan-poly(lactic-co-\n\nglycolic acid) (PLAGA) microspheres were molded by mixing them with acetic acid solution, \n\nin a stainless steel mold (190). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Micro computed tomography image of a cross-section of chitosan scaffolds \n\nobtained by particle aggregation method (A) and interface between particles stained with \n\neosin (B).  \n\n \n\n Rapid prototyping is a processing route enabling also to develop chitosan porous \n\nscaffolds. This methodology is based on the production of a 3D physical model from \n\ncomputer aided design data (CAD software), which is generated in a layer-by-layer \n\ndeposition process (150, 191). Theoretically, a great variety of morphologies and shapes can \n\nbe created by different variants of these techniques, and the scaffolds will be highly \n\nreproducible.   \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 16\u00a0\n\n Our group developed different chitosan based scaffolds by melt based routes (42, \n\n44). The vast majority of the processing methods used to produce chitosan scaffolds involve \n\nthe use of solvents. Those solvents are frequently harmful for cells, because residual solvent \n\nmay be entrapped in the scaffold and these are toxic for the cells. We developed various \n\nblends of chitosan with different aliphatic polyesters. Those blends can be processed by \n\ncompression molding followed by salt leaching (42) and by melt spinning and fiber bonding \n\n(27, 44) into porous scaffolds with different morphologies and mechanical properties (Figure \n\n2).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Chitosan based scaffolds produced by compression molding followed by particle \nleaching (A) and fiber bonding (B) methodologies. \n\n \n\n A systematic list of various porous scaffold compositions using chitosan, the \n\nprocessing methods used to obtain the scaffolds and the in vitro evaluation with different cell \n\ntypes is provided in Table I. It is clear from the table that the most used processing method to \n\nobtain chitosan-based porous scaffolds is freeze drying or freeze related processes.

Introduction  \n\n 18\u00a0\n\n8. IN VITRO CELLULAR APPROACH IN BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING  \n\n The development of new scaffolds follows a typical evaluation routine. The first step is \n\nthe assessment of the eventual cytotoxicity. This initial screening is based on the use of \n\nextracted leachables from the scaffold, i.e., substances that leach out of the biomaterials. \n\nThese leachables are added in defined concentrations to standard culture medium and \n\nplaced in contact with a cell line for a determined period of time. After this, cell viability and \n\ncell morphology are evaluated to determine the eventual toxicity to the cells. The use of cell \n\nlines is recommended in a first stage, given that these cells are reproducible and can be \n\nexpanded into large numbers. Cell lines, such as mouse fibroblast cells (L929) or human \n\nosteosarcoma cells (SAOS-2), are frequently used. If the scaffolds show no signs of cell \n\ncytotoxicity or morphology changes, the next step involves direct contact assays with an \n\nappropriate cell type to evaluate the cytocompatibility and phenotype functionality. A valid 3D \n\nconstruct for bone tissue engineering applications should have a positive outcome from this \n\nsequence of initial in-vitro tests.  \n\n \n\n8.1. SELECTION OF CELLS  \n\n The cell source should be ideally non-immunogenic, easily available, non-\n\ntumorogenic and with defined and adequate characteristics. It should be expandable into \n\nlarge numbers and have demonstrated osteogenic potential. Autologous cells, from each \n\npatient, are the most preferred (198-202). These cells may be isolated from a biopsy of tissue \n\n(e.g. cartilage, bone, skin) from the patient. The tissue obtained is dissociated and the \n\nisolated cells are expanded in culture for later implantation into the same patient (29, 70, \n\n198). The use of autologous cells eliminates the risk of immune rejection, avoiding the need \n\nof using immunosuppressive drugs. For bone tissue engineering applications, osteoblasts \n\nare the most obvious selection, since those cells are responsible for the bone formation (74). \n\nHowever, these cells have limited availability since the number of cells that are obtained after \n\nthe isolation procedure is low and the expansion rate is slow (203). In the last years, stem \n\ncells appeared as a valid alternative (203). The term stem cell is used to describe \n\nundifferentiated cells with ability to self-renew and maintain itself for long periods of time \n\nkeeping its multilineage differentiation capacity (65). Stem cells can be classified as \n\nembryonic or adult. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells derived from the inner \n\ncell mass of the blastocyst stage of an embryo (204). These cells possess long-term \n\nproliferation potential and are able to differentiate into all the types of somatic cells in the \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 19\u00a0\n\norganism. Nevertheless, ethical issues regarding its source restrain its use in regenerative \n\nmedicine. Adult stem cells (ASCs) are a valid and alternative option to ESCs. These cells can \n\nbe isolated from different adult tissue sources such as bone marrow (65), peripheral blood \n\n(205), adipose tissue (206), or fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (207), amniotic fluid (208) \n\nor placenta (209). ASCs are multipotential cells, capable of differentiating into several cell \n\nlineages such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes (210). Recent reports sustain the \n\nplasticity of these cells, i.e. the ability of differentiate into other cell types rather than the ones \n\nthey are committed (211).  \n\n  The process of osteogenic differentiation of stem cells may be achieved by expanding \n\nthe cells in standard culture medium, supplemented with ?-glycerophosphate (212), ascorbic \n\nacid (213), and dexamethasone (67, 213). These agents activate the osteogenic commitment \n\nof stem cells. Culture of osteogenic cells depends on the adequate supplementation of their \n\ngrowth medium with a source of inorganic phosphate (214), ?-glycerophosphate, a non \n\nphysiological organic substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (215), in order to produce \n\nmineralized ECM. Ascorbic acid is essential for the survival of human osteoblasts in vitro \n\n(216). This osteogenic inducing agent is required for collagen synthesis and alkaline \n\nphosphatase activity (213). Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that increases the expression \n\nof several genes associated with osteogenic differentiation (217). Moreover, the timing, size \n\nand number of bone like nodules is affected by the dose of dexamethasone used (218). \n\nOsteogenic medium can also be supplemented with growth factors, naturally existent in the \n\nbone structure, such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), \n\nplatelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) and insulin \n\ngrowth factors (IGFs) (219-226). The process of osteogenic differentiation is coordinated and \n\ninvolves three main stages: i) cell proliferation; ii) ECM deposition and maturation; and iii) \n\nmineralization (227). During cell proliferation, growth genes are expressed (228). \n\nImmediately following the down-regulation of the proliferation, the expression of ALP \n\nincreases (227). During this period, the ECM undergoes a series of events that renders it \n\ncompetent for mineralization (ECM maturation and hydroxyapatite formation) (228). After this \n\nstage ECM becomes mineralized (227, 228). With the onset of mineralization, the ECM \n\nprotein genes become up-regulated, like osteopontin and osteocalcin that are increasingly \n\nexpressed with the accumulation of mineral (227). ALP activity prior to the onset of the \n\nmineralization suggests that this enzyme is involved in the preparation of the ECM for \n\nmineral deposition (227). This enzyme is considered to be an early marker of osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation and used to assess in vitro the osteogenic differentiation (20, 229, 230). The \n\nmineral content of the bone ECM can be qualitatively assessed by alizarin red or von Kossa \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 20\u00a0\n\nstaining and the calcium content can be quantitatively assessed. This information can be \n\ncomplemented by the analysis of the mineral fraction by energy dispersive spectroscopy to \n\ndetect the presence of calcium and phosphorous elements, thin-film X-ray diffraction to \n\nanalyze the crystallinity of the ECM and Fourier-transformed spectroscopy to detect the \n\ncarbonate and phosphate groups (27, 231). \n\n \n\n8.2. In vitro studies with chitosan as a biomaterial \n\n It is well accepted that the cells strongly interact with their environment, namely with \n\nneighboring cells, ECM and the surface to which they adhere (232). Chitosan as a \n\nbiomaterial, like previously mentioned, has an analogous structure to the GAGs present in \n\nthe ECM of connective tissues. Several studies describe the positive influence of chitosan \n\nover cell attachment, proliferation and over the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs (Table I). \n\nMouse MSCs in contact with a chitosan suspension were shown to facilitate its osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation, when compared to cells seeded onto polystyrene culture wells (233). Lahiji et \n\nal. reported that chitosan, coated in coverslips, is an appropriate substrate for the growth of \n\nhuman osteoblasts and chondrocytes (110). Poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) films modified with \n\nchitosan solution evidenced improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and biosynthetic activity, \n\nusing human osteoblasts (234). Moreover, neonatal rat calvaria osteoblasts proliferate at \n\nsuperior rates on titanium surfaces coated with chitosan compared with titanium alone (235). \n\nIn fact, coating of titanium pins with chitosan, induced minimal inflammatory response and a \n\npositive healing of a rabbit tibia bone defect (236). MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells \n\nproliferated and evidenced increased ALP activity, as well as up-regulation of osteogenic \n\ngenes expression in composite chitosan/poly(lactide-co-glicolic acid) (PLAGA) scaffolds as \n\ncompared to PLAGA scaffolds (190). Chitosan\u2013collagen sponges with higher concentration \n\nof chitosan positively promoted osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs and improved the \n\nmechanical and physical properties of the matrices (173). Previous studies from our group, \n\nusing flat discs obtained by injection molding composed of chitosan-PBS and PBS blends, \n\nshowed that chitosan had a positive effect on osteoblast like cells (237). Furthermore, in \n\nliterature, PCL nanofibrous scaffolds containing chitosan, revealed that stem cells adhered, \n\nproliferated and expressed phenotypic markers of osteogenic differentiation in a superior way \n\nwhen compared to nanofibrous scaffolds alone (189, 238). The ability of chitosan to support \n\ncell adhesion and influence osteogenic differentiation of cells can be attributed to its chemical \n\nproperties.  \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 21\u00a0\n\n  The in vitro testing systems are inevitably limited in their capacity to recreate the \n\ncomplex in vivo environment. Therefore, these tests are unable to predict accurately the in \n\nvivo performance, particularly in the context of tissue engineering and regeneration of \n\nfunctional tissues. Thus, in a later stage of development it is critical to test the developed \n\nstrategies in vivo. \n\n \n\n9. IN VIVO ANIMAL MODELS \n\n The general trend in bone tissue engineering after successful in vitro testing of the \n\nconstructs is to implant the tissue-engineered construct into a relevant animal model. First, it \n\nis necessary to obtain a proof of concept of the tissue engineering strategy, in vivo. For this, \n\nan ectopic model in a small animal (mouse or rat) is commonly used. The constructs are \n\nimplanted into a non-bone related anatomic location of the animal body (90, 239-241). These \n\nareas can be intraperitoneal, intramuscular, mesenteric or subcutaneous. This model is also \n\ninteresting to determine if a scaffold has adequate properties namely porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity, to allow tissue ingrowth and neovascularization. It is important to conclude \n\nabout the biodegradation of the implanted material, in terms of degradation products and also \n\nthe host immune response. If the aim is to use human cells, nude mouse/rat models are the \n\nmost commonly used, because these animals do not have thymus, being unable to produce \n\nmature T lymphocytes, compromising the immune system. Therefore, its immune system is \n\nnot able to react against xenogeneic cells (89, 220, 242). The purpose of using such model is \n\nto conclude about the ability of the tissue-engineered constructs to form ectopic bone and \n\nalso to verify about osteoinductivity, i.e. the ability of the scaffold to induce proliferation of \n\nundifferentiated stem cells, as well as their differentiation into the osteogenic lineage (243-\n\n245).  \n\n The in vivo approach should mimic as close as possible the real clinical situation. \n\nFrequently, it is created an intraosseous wound that will not heal spontaneously during the \n\nlifetime of the animal (critical size defect) (83). The minimum size considered being a critical \n\nsize defect is not absolute clear. The defect cannot be defined only by size, it is dependent \n\non various variables, such as type of specie, anatomic location, among many others (246). \n\nGuidelines are available for the dimensions of implants based on the size of the animal, type \n\nof bone chosen and on the implant design to avoid pathological fracture of the test location \n\n(247). It is important to include controls in the experimental design. These controls should be \n\nof a material already in clinical use and also a control consisting of an empty defect, to prove \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n 22\u00a0\n\nthat the bone defect is not able to regenerate by itself (247). There are several types of bone \n\ndefects that can be used, such as cranial, segmental, partially cortical and cancellous bone. \n\nThese locations can be subjected to load or non-load bearing (e.g. femur or calvarial, \n\nrespectively). The type of animal can be small (mouse or rat) (90, 104, 226, 248, 249) or \n\nlarge (rabbit, sheep, goat, dogs or primates) (146, 198, 250-255). Typically, researchers start \n\nwith a smaller model mainly with less costs involved but also because it is easier to compare \n\nresults between a wealth of experiments reported in the literature. One of the most accepted \n\nnon-loading bearing models is the calvaria bone defect. This bone is a flat bone, allowing the \n\ncreation of a uniform circular defect, and has an adequate size for easy surgical procedure \n\nand specimen handling. The dura mater and the overlying skin provide fixation of the \n\nscaffold. The model has been systematically studied and is very well established (83, 84, \n\n256, 257). This model can be performed in small animals using rat (258, 259) or mouse (226, \n\n248). It can be also applied to large animals, like rabbit (260-262) or sheep (202).  \n\n The last stage of preclinical trials of a bone tissue engineering strategy should be \n\nperformed in animals that are believed to be more similar to humans, in terms of metabolism, \n\nphysiology, anatomy, etc. Bones of small animals are more reactive to specific stimuli and \n\nare not subjected to comparable stresses. For example, a femur defect in rats (263-265) is \n\nbelieved to heal faster that in larger animals (256). However, in a study where the authors \n\ncompared the bone ingrowth using the same chamber, in rats and in goats, no significant \n\ndifferences were observed between the two animals (266). In vivo experimentation design is \n\ntherefore not an easy task, it is necessary to balance all the variables and decide which \n\nanimal models suits better the specific goals of the experiment. Surgeries involving load-\n\nbearing conditions, involving stabilization with internal or external fixation devices, require the \n\npresence of experts to perform the surgery. The maintenance of the animals is expensive \n\nand variations within the same group may be larger as compared to those that are found in \n\nsmall laboratory animals. A countless number of variables need to be addressed to assure \n\nthat the chosen model is the most appropriate for testing a specific situation. Consequently, \n\nvariables should be minimized and very well controlled to reduce the random effects and to \n\nensure as much as possible statistical significance. It is also very important to moderate the \n\nnumber of variables, such as physical condition of the animal (nutritional status, diet, age, \n\nsex), anesthesics and analgesics, type of bone defect (location, use of fixation) and, finally, \n\nthe methodologies used to assess the sample collection and characterization. Despite the \n\nissues aforementioned, the final pre-clinical tests should be performed in large animals, \n\nsubjected to load bearing comparable to the human case. For this proposes, the sheep or \n\ngoat may be a good option. Both have a similar metabolism and bone remodeling rate to \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 23\u00a0\n\nhumans, as well as a comparable weight (12, 18, 199, 202, 252). \n\n \n\n9.1. In vivo bone regeneration studies with chitosan material \n\n  As described before, chitosan is already used in medicine, as a biomaterial for \n\nwound dressings. However, there are several reports in the literature showing the ability of \n\nchitosan to be used as material to regenerate bone (Table II). The first report describing the \n\nattempt to in vivo regenerate bone using chitosan structures dates back from 1988 (113), \n\nwhen Muzzarelli and colleagues implanted chitosan membranes and chitosan ascorbate gel \n\ninto cranial defects in cats. Their findings suggested that chitosan seems to induce some \n\ntype of stimulatory and/or attractive effect over the stromal cells of the surrounding tissues.  \n\n \n\nTable II.

Introduction  \n\n 24\u00a0\n\nchitosan in defects created in the tibia of rabbits (146) and in the femoral head of sheep \n\n(147). These studies confirmed the previous results (113) about the possible stimulatory \n\nand/or attractive effect of chitosan over cells. Chitosan has been also used as carrier for \n\ngrowth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to promote bone \n\nformation in a calvaria critical sized defect in rats (221, 268). Osteoconductive \n\nchitosan/tricalcium phosphate (TCP) sponges promoted osseous healing of the rat calvarial \n\ndefects as compared to controls (without scaffolds) and the addition of PDGF-BB to the \n\ncarrier further enhanced bone regeneration, favoring its osteoinductivity (268). These authors \n\nobserved that chitosan/TCP sponge with PDGF-BB promoted more bone formation of the \n\ndefects as compared to chitosan-TCP without the bioactive agents (221). PDGF growth \n\nfactor is produced by platelets, osteoblasts and monocytes/macrophages and it is believed to \n\nhave a role in the migration of MSCs to the wounding sites (272). Electrospun chitosan \n\nnanofiber membranes evidenced new bone formation at four weeks in calvaria defects of \n\nrabbits when compared to the controls (empty bone defects), where only soft tissue formation \n\nwas observed (182). Chitosan combined with nano-hydroxyapatite in the form of \n\nmicrospheres were implanted in rat calvaria defects for twelve weeks, being able to promote \n\nbone regeneration (54). Moreover, chitosan-PLAGA microspheres conjugated in a scaffold \n\nby particle aggregation, with or without heparin and recombinant human bone morphogenetic \n\nprotein 2 (rhBMP-2) showed to promote bone regeneration in vivo (271). More pronounced \n\nresults were obtained for the scaffolds with the incorporated growth factor (271). A study by \n\nR\u00edos and co-workers (50) used a model mimicking the clinical bone free flaps, by flap \n\nprefabrication technique, which involves the design of the desired tissue at an ectopic site in \n\nthe patient own body. This study used chambers containing silk fibroin-chitosan scaffolds \n\nimplanted on top of the grafted periosteum over the latissimus dorsi muscle of sheeps (50). \n\nBone grafts were used as positive controls and empty defects as negative controls. The \n\nauthors found that the same amount of bone was regenerated in the defects with the tested \n\nscaffolds, as for the defects with the bone grafts (50). \n\n\u00a0\n\n10. CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n The developments in bone tissue engineering were considerable but there is not yet a \n\ntissue-engineered product that has reached clinical application. Both cells and biomaterial \n\ncomponents need to be optimized to produce a functional bone tissue engineered therapy. \n\n New stem cell sources are being explored, such as the extra-embryonic tissues, \n\n\n\n CHAPTER I. Introduction \n\n 25\u00a0\n\nplacenta, amniotic fluid or umbilical cord. These stem cells have been shown to express \n\npluripotent markers and low immunogenicity, evidencing a more primitive state. These cells \n\nare usually discarded, which make these sources attractive candidates for tissue engineering \n\napplications. Moreover, the low immunogenic potential could enable the use of these cells as \n\nan allogenic cell source for successful bone repair. \n\n A new generation of biodegradable natural biomaterials is emerging, being chitosan \n\none of the most interesting. Chitosan has been extensively studied as a biomaterial for bone \n\ntissue engineering scaffolding, but in practice it is still and only used as a wound dressing \n\nand hemostatic agent in medicine. Several morphologies can be successfully obtained by \n\ndifferent processing techniques, which turn this material attractive for this end. Although \n\nseveral studies reporting the biological enhancement by chitosan and its influence over \n\nosteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration, still remains unclear the mechanism of \n\naction. It is worthwhile to continue to pursuit research over this interesting natural polymer in \n\norder to clarify its function over cell performance, as well as, to improve the scaffold \n\nprocessing methodologies, that will lead to the clinical use in the bone regeneration field. \n\n \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n This review was supported by the FCT grant (SFRH/24735/2005) attributed to Ana \nCosta-Pinto.

Materials and methods \n\n 45\u00a0\n\nChapter II \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n The main aim of this chapter is to describe in more detail the experimental work and \n\nprotocols related to the experiments performed and the obtained results. Together with \n\nchapter I, it will establish the rationale of the research reported in this thesis, which was the \n\nbiological evaluation of chitosan based scaffolds, in vitro and in vivo, envisioning bone tissue \n\nengineering applications. For that, it will be briefly described the materials used and the \n\nscaffolds processing methodologies. It will be explained in more detail the in vitro biological \n\ncharacterization techniques and the in vivo animal models used and respective \n\ncharacterization methodologies. \n\n \n\n1. Materials \n\n1.1. Chitosan \n\n Chitosan (Ch) is a linear polysaccharide, obtained from the alkaline deacetylation of \n\nchitin, composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine linked in a ? (1-4) link (1). \n\nImportant parameters affecting the characteristics of chitosan are its molecular weight (Mw) \n\nand its degree of deacetylation (DD) (2). The degree of deacetylation of chitosan refers to the \n\nratio between the deacetylated and acetylated units. The solubility of chitosan depends on \n\nthe free amino and N-acetyl groups being soluble in acidic pH (3). Chitosan is a semi-\n\ncrystalline polymer and the degree of crystallinity depends on the degree of deacetylation. \n\nChitosan is a biodegradable polymer being degraded by lysozyme (4). The degradation rate \n\nof chitosan is inversely related to the degree of deacetylation (5). \n\n Chitosan presents a wide range of biological properties, which makes it one of the \n\nmost promising materials for tissue engineering applications. Important characteristics to be \n\nhighlighted are its biodegradability, biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, wound healing \n\nproperties and easy accessibility (low cost). Moreover, the chemical structure of chitosan \n\n(Figure 1) resembles the structure of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and these molecules play \n\nan important role in the modulation of various cell functions, morphology and differentiation \n\n(6). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 46\u00a0\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of chitosan \n \n\nThe chitosan herein used was purchased from France Chitine (Orange, France). \n\nFirstly, chitin was isolated from shrimp shells and squid bones by deproteinization and/or \n\ndemineralization, respectively. The chitosan was further obtained by the removal of enough \n\nacetyl groups (CH3-CO) from the chitin molecule (deacetylation process), releasing the amine \n\ngroups (NH) and giving to chitosan a cationic characteristic. \n\n \n\n1.2. Aliphatic polyesters \n Synthetic polymers have been extensively studied in tissue engineering field, such as \n\npoly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) and their copolymers. These \n\npolymers are biodegradable, because the ester bonds present in its structure are hydrolyzed \n\ninto non-toxic natural metabolites and are eliminated from the body via respiration. In the \n\npresent thesis the synthetic materials used were PCL, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and \n\npoly(butylene terephthalate adipate) (PBTA). More detail and special emphasis will be given \n\nto PBS, since it was the material used in the majority of the studies due to its biological \n\nperformance. \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Poly(butylene succinate) \n\nPoly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is an aliphatic polyester (Figure 2), commercially \n\navailable under the trademark Bionolle\u00ae. It was obtained from Showa Highpolymer Co. Ltd. \n\n(Tokyo, Japan), with the reference 1050, a polybutylene succinate copolymer. Bionolle\u00ae has \n\nbeen shown to be biodegradable in a variety of natural environments, decomposing into \n\nwater and carbon dioxide. It has been processed into films, sheets, filaments, nonwoven \n\nfabrics, laminates, molded foams and injection-molded products for diverse applications, \n\nnamely in agriculture, fishery, forestry, civil engineering and for common household goods. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 47\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2. Chemical \n\nstructure of poly(butylene succinate). \n\n \n\nPure PBS presents a hydrophobic behavior with low water uptake (~ 1.5%) and after \n\n60 days of immersion in the isotonic saline solution it displays a decrease in the mechanical \n\nproperties without any appreciable weight loss (~ 0.5%). This polymer presents a melting \n\ntemperature (Tm) of 104.3\u00baC.  \n\n \n\n2. Processing methods \n\n The materials used in this thesis were, always composed by chitosan and a synthetic \n\npolymer. The compositions were prepared by extrusion prior to be processed into a three \n\ndimensional (3D) structure. For the scaffolds production two different methodologies were \n\nused: compression molding followed by salt leaching and fiber bonding. Chitosan and \n\npolyester blends used for the production of the scaffolds are described in chapters III, IV, V, \n\nVI and VII. Those materials were compounded in a twin-screw extruder. Blends of chitosan \n\nwith poly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) were mixed at two different ratios - 25/75 wt% and \n\n50/50wt%, blends of chitosan with poly(caprolactone) (Ch-PCL) and poly(butylene \n\nterephthalate adipate) (Ch-PBTA) were mixed at 50/50 wt%. In chapter IV, it was used \n\npoly(butylene succinate) to produce scaffolds to be used as controls in an experiment \n\ndesigned to test the relevance of chitosan in biological terms. \n\n \n\n2.1. Compression molding/particulate leaching  \n\n The scaffolds described in chapters III, IV and VII were prepared after grinding the \n\ncompounded blends by solid mixing with NaCl particles, loaded into a mold that was further \n\nheated, and molded into large discs by compression. The salt content was 60% by weight \n\nand the size range of NaCl particles was 250\u2013500 \u00b5m for all the blends. These compression-\n\nmolded discs were further sliced to obtain different types of geometrical structures used in \n\ndifferent chapters, because of the size required to in vivo models employed. In chapter III, \n\ncubes of 5 mm3 were used, in chapter IV were used discs of 8 mm of diameter and 1 mm \n\nthick and in chapter VII were used small discs with 5 mm of diameter and 1mm thick were \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 48\u00a0\n\nused (Figure 3). These structures were then immersed in distilled water to leach out the \n\nporogen particles. The cubes were dried to constant weight and used for further tests. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Scheme of the scaffolds produced by compression molding followed by salt \nleaching used in different chapters. \n\n \n\n2.2. Fiber Bonding \n\n The chitosan/polyester blends used to process the scaffolds presented in chapters V \n\nand VI were compounded as previously described. The mixture of chitosan with \n\npoly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) (50-50% wt) was extruded into fibers, by using a single \n\nscrew micro-extruder. The obtained fibers were cut into 1 cm long and loaded into a Teflon \n\nmold. This mold was heated at 150\u00baC during a previously optimized time period. After that, \n\npressure was applied to allow fibers to weld at the junctions, forming a stable fiber mesh \n\nstructure. The porous mesh was further cut into discs with diameter of 6.5 mm and 1.5 mm \n\nthick. \n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Scaffolds Characterization \n\n When new polymeric scaffolds are developed, it is imperative to characterize these \n\nnovel structures. Physical and chemical characterization is performed to determine the \n\nsurface topography, morphological properties, 3D architecture, porosity and pore size, \n\ninterconnectivity and mechanical properties. The following techniques were used to \n\ncharacterize the developed scaffolds used in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 49\u00a0\n\n3.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\nAll the developed chitosan based scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM). This methodology is extremely important to study the morphology of \n\npolymeric materials and structures. This technique allows to analyze the morphology of the \n\nspecimen, at large magnifications and also the details of the structure up to the sub-micron \n\nlevel. Polymeric structures are non-conductive, being generally coated with conductive \n\nmaterials, such as gold or carbon. This fact is due to the fact that the intensity of the electron \n\nbeam can damage the thin polymeric samples, which can lead to the deformation and even \n\nmelting of the polymer. Furthermore, the accumulation of electrons at the surface of the \n\nspecimen causes the loss of image formed at the detector. \n\nThe developed scaffolds were sputter-coated with gold (Fisons Instruments, model SC502; \n\nEngland) for 2 minutes at 15 mA. The samples were further analyzed by scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (Leica Cambridge, model S360; England). Micrographs were recorded at 15 kV \n\nwith magnifications ranging from 100 to 5000 times. \n\n \n\n3.2. Micro computed tomography \n\n Micro computed tomography (\u00b5CT) technique was used to recreate 3D images of the \n\nscaffolds. This methodology is based on the use of a X-ray source to create shadow \n\nimages/projections of a 3D object that later can be used with an appropriate software to \n\nrecreate a virtual model. It is named micro because pixel sizes of the cross-sections are in \n\nthe micrometer range. The X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan, \n\nwhile the sample rotates, to allow obtaining the slices of the object morphology.  \n\n The scaffolds used in chapter III, V and VI were evaluated by \u00b5-CT, carried out by \n\nscanning in high-resolution mode of 8.7 \u00b5m x/y/z and an exposure time of 1792 ms. The \n\nenergy parameters defined in the scanner were 63 keV with a current of 157 \u00b5A. Data were \n\nobtained by the system and reconstructed in 2D images. These slice images were further \n\ncompiled and analyzed to render 3D images and obtain quantitative architecture parameters. \n\nA ?CT analyzer and a ?CT Volume Realistic 3D Visualization, both from SkyScan, were used \n\nas image processing tools for both ?CT reconstruction and to create/visualize the 3D \n\nrepresentation. Regions of interest (square of 4.5x4.5 mm2) were selected in each slice \n\nimage and thresholded to eliminate background noise. This threshold (to distinguish polymer \n\nmaterial from pore voids) was selected and maintained constant for all the scanned \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 50\u00a0\n\nspecimens and samples. The threshold was also inverted to obtain pore volume and to \n\nanalyze both the pore morphology and its interconnectivity. \n\n Chitosan-based fiber mesh scaffolds, exploited in chapter IV and VII, were scanned in \n\nhigh resolution mode using a pixel size of 8.24 ?m and integration time of 2.0 ms. The X-ray \n\nsource was set at 80 keV of energy and 124 ?A of current. For all the scanned specimens \n\nrepresentative data sets of 150 slices were transformed into binary using a dynamic \n\nthreshold of 60-255 (grey values) to distinguish polymer material from pore voids. This data \n\nwas used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyzer v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). 3D virtual models of \n\nrepresentative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were also created, visualized and \n\nregistered using both image processing softwares (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan). Five \n\nscaffolds were examined for each type of scaffolds. \n\n \n\n3.3. Mechanical properties \n\n The mechanical testing of the scaffolds was performed under compression loading \n\nusing a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min and the results presented are the average of at least \n\nfive specimens. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before \n\ntesting. The values reported are the average of at least five specimens per condition. The \n\ncompressive modulus was determined in the most linear region of the stress\u2013strain graph \n\nusing the secant method. In the cases that the yield stress was not clearly defined, it was \n\ncalculated as the stress at the intersection of a line drawn parallel to the linear region and \n\nintercepting the x-axis at 1% strain. \n\n \n\n3.4. In vitro degradation studies \n\n The biomaterials used in this PhD thesis were biodegradable polymers. These \n\nmaterials degrade over time in a way that the neo-tissue can develop, without long-term \n\npresence of foreign components and finally cleared from the organism. Biodegradation of \n\npolymeric biomaterials requires cleavage of hydrolytically or enzymatically sensitive bonds in \n\nthe polymer, leading to polymer erosion (7). Degradation products should be non-toxic and \n\nnon-immunogenic, therefore not inducing strong inflammatory reaction. These products \n\nshould be small enough to dissolve in the body fluids and, after transportation via lymphatic \n\nsystem into kidneys, these should be able to excrete them from the body (8). Polymers that \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 51\u00a0\n\nare known to degrade in the body, either by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation can be \n\nmodeled in vitro, in order to predict their behavior when implanted in vivo. \n\n The degradation studies described in chapter VII were performed by incubating the \n\nscaffolds in phosphate buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) (control), with lipase from Aspergillus \n\noryzal (Fluka) and/or lysozyme from chicken egg white (Sigma, St. Louis), at concentrations \n\nsimilar to the ones found in human blood serum (110 U/L for lipase and 13 mg/L for \n\nlysozyme), at 37\u00baC in dynamic conditions (60 rpm) for 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. In one \n\nexperiment the solutions were changed every 7 days, while in the other the solutions were \n\nnot changed throughout the experiment. At the end of each degradation period, the samples \n\nwere removed, gently blotted to eliminate the water excess and immediately weighed for \n\ndetermination of water uptake and dried for later calculation of weight loss.  \n\n \n\n3.4.1. Water uptake and weight loss measurements \n\nAt the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately \n\nweighed for determination of water uptake (Equation 1) (Chapter V), washed thoroughly with \n\ndistilled water and dried for later calculation of weight loss (Equation 2) (Chapters III, V, VI, \n\nand VII): \n\n \n\nWater uptake (%) = [(ww \u2013 wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) \n\n \n\nWeight loss (%) = [wi \u2013 wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) \n\n \n\nwhere wi is the initial weight, ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. \n\n \n\n4. In vitro biological characterization  \n\n All the scaffolds used in the next sections of this thesis were sterilized by ethylene \n\noxide. The routine followed in biological assessment of the developed scaffolds included \n\ncytotoxicity evaluation, direct contact tests with cell lines and in a later stage with human \n\nprimary cells. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 52\u00a0\n\n4.1. Cytotoxicity assessment \n\n After the development of the scaffolds, the next step is the assessment of the \n\neventual cytotoxicity. This initial screening is based on the use of the scaffold leachables, i.e., \n\nsubstances that leach out of the biomaterials. These leachables are placed in contact with a \n\ncell line, for a determined period of time. After that time, cell viability and morphology are \n\nevaluated, to determine the eventual toxicity to the cells. In this first stage it is recommended \n\nthe use of cell lines, because these cells are reproducible, well characterized in the literature \n\nand large amounts of cells can be obtained with cell expansion. \n\n In the work developed in this thesis it was used a rat lung fibroblast cell line -L929, \n\nacquired from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, to perform the initial cytotoxicity \n\nevaluation of the developed scaffolds. Cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco?s \n\nmodified eagle?s medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine \n\nserum (FBS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 1% of antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (10,000 \n\nU/mL penicillin G sodium; 10,000 U/mL streptomycin sulphate; 25 \u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) \n\n(Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). Trypsin/EDTA (0.25% w/v trypsin/0.02% EDTA, Sigma) was used \n\nto detach the cells from the culture flasks before the experiments were conducted. \n\n Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (n=6) at a density of 1.8 x 104 cells/well and \n\nincubated for 24 h at 37\u00baC, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The ratio of material \n\nweight to extract fluid was constant and equal to 0.25 g/mL. Latex rubber was used as a \n\npositive control of cell death, because it has a strong cytotoxic effect leading to extensive cell \n\ndeath. The ratio of latex material outer surface to extraction fluid was 2.5 cm2/mL. Culture \n\nmedium was used as negative control of cytotoxicity, considered to be the ideal condition for \n\ncell growth. Test scaffolds (n=6) and positive control were extracted for 24 h at 37\u00baC, using \n\ncomplete culture medium as the extraction fluid. Before the tests, culture medium was \n\nremoved from wells with cells adhered, and an identical volume (200 \u00b5L) of extraction fluid \n\nwas added. The cells were left to proliferate in the extract fluid for 72 h. After this period, the \n\nextraction fluid was removed, and the metabolic activity and, consequently, cell viability was \n\ndetermined by a colorimetric assay named CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell \n\nProliferation Assay (Promega, USA). Briefly, this assay is based on the bioreduction of a \n\ntetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-\n\nsulfofenyl)-2H tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS)) into a brown formazan product that is soluble in \n\nculture medium. This conversion is accomplished by the production of nicotinamide adenine \n\ndinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by the \n\ndehydrogenase enzymes existing in the metabolically active cells. The quantity of formazan \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 53\u00a0\n\nproduct bioreduced is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture, as \n\nmeasured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, model \n\nSynergie HT, USA), after 3 h of incubation at 37\u00baC. Triplicates were made for each sample \n\nand per culture time. \n\n \n\n4.2. Direct cell contact tests \n\n4.2.1. Mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell line - BMC9 \n\n If the scaffolds show no signs of cell cytotoxicity or morphological changes, the next \n\nstep will be to proceed for direct contact assays with an appropriate cell source to develop a \n\nvalid 3D construct for bone tissue engineering applications. \n\n The developed scaffolds were composed of several aliphatic polyesters and chitosan. \n\nFirst all of these scaffolds were evaluated in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation and \n\nosteogenic potential. For this initial screening, described in chapter III, it was used a mouse \n\nmesenchymal stem cell line \u2013 BMC9. These cells were previously shown to be able to \n\ndifferentiate into several phenotypes, including the osteogenic lineage (9).  \n\n Cells were grown in DMEM, supplemented with 10% of FBS and 1% of antibiotic\u2013\n\nantimycotic mixture. When the adequate number of cells was obtained, they were detached \n\nwith trypsin, and seeded at a density of 5x105 cells per scaffold. The seeding methodology \n\nconsisted in dropping an aliquot of 10 \u00b5L on top of the scaffolds. After 2 h, 1 mL of \n\nosteogenic inducing culture medium was added to each well. The cell-seeded scaffolds were \n\nmaintained at 37\u00baC, and 5% CO2. The osteogenic medium consisted in the same medium \n\ndescribed before, but supplemented with osteogenic agents, dexamethasone 10-8 M, \n\nascorbic acid 50 \u00b5g/mL and ?-glycerophosphate 10 mM. These supplements are required for \n\na successful osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that \n\nincreases the expression of several different genes associated with osteogenic differentiation \n\n(10). Ascorbic acid is essential for collagen synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity (11). \n\nCulture of osteogenic cells depends on supplementation of their growth medium with a \n\nsource of inorganic phosphate (12) - ?-glycerophosphate, a non-physiological organic \n\nsubstrate of alkaline phosphatase, allowing to produce mineralized ECM. To simplify the \n\nnomenclature of the cell seeded and cultured scaffolds in vitro, these will be identified as \n\n\u201cconstructs\u201d in the next chapters. \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 54\u00a0\n\n4.2.2. Primary cultures of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells \n\n The subsequent work developed after the screening of the best scaffold formulation \n\nfor bone tissue engineering, was performed with primary cultures of human bone marrow \n\nmesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). These cells were isolated from human bone marrow \n\naspirates obtained during routine surgical procedures involving knee arthroplasties. The \n\ncollection of samples was approved by the ethical committee of the S\u00e3o Marcos hospital in \n\nBraga, under the cooperation agreement established between the 3B\u00b4s research group-UM \n\nand that hospital. A detailed informed consent was signed by each donor. The isolation \n\nprocedure relies on the principle that from the several cell populations existent in bone \n\nmarrow, only the adherent fraction will be isolated, being considered marrow stromal cells \n\n(13). Briefly, the bone marrow aspirate was centrifuged and all the fat tissue fraction, as well \n\nas cartilage and bone remnants were discarded. The cell suspension was incubated with \n\neritrocytes lysis buffer to lyse these cells. The resultant cell suspension was plated and \n\ncultured. The cell population characterized by flow cytometry for stemness markers (clusters \n\nof differentiation-CD) CD29, 44, 73, 90, 105 and 106 and as well for the hematopoietic \n\nexclusion markers CD34 and 45. These adherent cells showed spindle-shape morphology \n\nand colony-forming unit (CFU) capacity. The isolated cells were also characterized for its \n\nmultipotential ability, being differentiated for osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic \n\nlineages. \n\n \n\n4.3. hBMSCs culture, seeding into the scaffolds and differentiation into the osteogenic \n\nlineage \n\n High numbers of hBMSCs are required to perform cell seeding into the developed \n\nscaffolds, for all quantitative and qualitative analysis. The isolated cells were expanded in \n\nbasal medium consisting of alfa Eagle?s medium (?-MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) \n\nsupplemented with 10% FBS and 1 % antibiotic/antimyotic solution. Cells were cultured at \n\n37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. \n\n When cells reached confluency, at passages 4-5 they were harvested for static \n\nseeding onto the scaffolds, at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold. The constructs were \n\ncultured under static conditions, in standard osteogenic differentiation medium, described in \n\nsubsection 4.2.1. The constructs were collected at different culture times: 7, 14 and 21 days, \n\nbecause it is expected that by the end of the experiment, the cells already show a definied \n\nosteogenic phenotype (14).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 55\u00a0\n\n4.3.1. Evaluation of cell morphology and distribution \n\n SEM was used to analyze the level of cell attachment and its morphology, as well as \n\ndistribution on the surface of the scaffolds. To achieve those goals it is required the use of \n\nmethods of fixation or stabilization of the cells on the scaffolds to obtain biological samples in \n\ntheir natural state. Coating of the mples with gold was performed as described in subsection \n\n3.1. Additionally, due to the non-electric conductivity of those samples it is also needed to \n\ncoat the samples with a conductive material such as gold or carbon. The constructs were \n\nfixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, USA) \n\nsolution, during 15 min at RT. Then, they were dehydrated through graded series of ethanol \n\nand let to dry overnight. Finally, they were gold or carbon sputter coated (Fisons Instruments, \n\nmodel SC502; England) during 2 min at 15 mA, and analyzed by SEM (Leica Cambridge, \n\nmodel S360; England) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS; link-eXL-II). \n\n The constructs were also analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy \n\n(FluoView1000, Olympus, Germany) in chapters III and IV. Cells were stained with calcein \n\nAM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). This molecule is hydrolyzed by endogenous \n\nesterases into the highly negatively charged calcein, which is retained inside the cells. In this \n\nway, it is possible to observe the distribution of viable cells throughout the scaffold structure. \n\n Histological analysis of the scaffolds was reported in chapter III. Hematoxylin-Eosin \n\n(H&amp;E) staining was performed to observe the cell morphology and its distribution into the \n\ndeveloped scaffolds. Basically, constructs were stained with Harris hematoxylin (Merck, \n\nGermany) during 1 to 3 minutes, until reaching the desired staining intensity. They were \n\nfurther washed in running tap water and afterwards a blue stain enhancement was performed \n\nby an immersion in 0.5% ammonia (Aldrich, Germany) for 5\u201310 seconds. The constructs \n\nwere washed again in running tap water, followed by an immersion in alcohol 96 %, and \n\nstained in Shandon Eosin-Y (Thermo Scientific, UK) for 30 seconds. The samples were again \n\nwashed in alcohol 96% and dehydrated through two immersions in alcohol 100 %. Before \n\npermanent mounting in Histomount\u2122 (National Diagnostics, UK), the stained constructs were \n\nimmersed in xylene for 1-2 min. Stained sections were observed under an optical microscope \n\n(BX61, Olympus Corporation, Germany) and images captured with a digital camera (DP70, \n\nOlympus Corporation, Germany). \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 56\u00a0\n\n4.3.2. Cell viability assay \n\n Cell viability was assessed by indirect measurements based on its metabolic activity, \n\nat each time period by CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay \n\n(Promega; USA), as described in subsection 4.1. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Cell proliferation assay \u2013 DNA quantification \n\n Measurements of DNA synthesis are frequently taken to be representative of the \n\namount of cell proliferation (15). Cell proliferation rate determination is often used to \n\ndetermine the response of cells to a particular stimulus, i.e., physical (e.g. topography of a \n\nsubstrate) or chemical (toxin or growth/differentiation factor).  \n\n In the present work, cell proliferation was quantified by the total amount of double-\n\nstranded DNA (dsDNA) using an ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain. Quant-iT\u2122 \n\nPicoGreen\u00ae dsDNA reagent was selected since it enables to quantify as little as 25 pg/mL of \n\ndsDNA (50 pg dsDNA in a 2 mL assay volume) with a standard spectrofluorometer and \n\nspecific fluorescein excitation and emission wavelengths. Additionally, dsDNA can be \n\nquantified in the presence of equimolar concentrations of ssDNA and RNA with minimal \n\neffect on the quantitative results obtained. The Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit \n\n(Invitrogen\u2122, Molecular Probes\u2122; Oregon, USA) was used according to the manufacturer?s \n\ninstructions. Briefly, cells in the construct were lysed by osmotic and thermal shock and the \n\nsupernatant used for the DNA quantification assay. A fluorescent dye, PicoGreen, was used \n\nbecause of its high sensitivity and specificity to double-stranded DNA. The fluorescence of \n\nthe dye was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485/20 nm and at an emission \n\nwavelength of 528/20 nm, in a microplate reader (Synergie HT, Bio-Tek, USA). The DNA \n\nconcentration for each sample was calculated using a standard curve (DNA concentration \n\nranging from 0.0 to 1.5 ?g/ml) relating quantity of DNA and fluorescence intensity. Triplicates \n\nwere made for each sample and per culturing time \n\n \n\n4.3.4. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) quantification \n\n A detailed analysis of the mineralization and of the progression of differentiation can \n\nbe obtained by biochemical assays. Routine assessments involve the quantification of total \n\ncalcium content and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a cell surface protein bound \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 57\u00a0\n\nto the plasma membrane though phosphatidylinositol phospholipid complexes (16). High ALP \n\nactivity is associated with the active formation of mineralized matrix and highest levels are \n\nfound in the mineralization front of the bone healing process. \n\n The concentration of ALP was determined for all time culture periods, using the same \n\nsamples used for DNA quantification. Briefly, the activity of ALP was assessed using the p-\n\nnitrophenol assay. Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (pnPP; Fluka BioChemika, Austria) is \n\ncolourless, is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase, produced by cells, at pH 10.5 and \n\ntemperature of 37\u00baC, to form free p-nitrophenol, which is yellow. The reaction was stopped by \n\nthe addition of 2 M NaOH (Panreac Quimica, Spain) and the absorbance read at 405 nm in a \n\nmicroplate reader (Bio-Tek, Synergie HT; USA). Standards were prepared with 10 ?mol/ml p-\n\nnytrophenol (pNP; Sigma, USA) solution, to obtain a standard curve ranging from 0 to 0.25 \n\n?mol/ml). Triplicates of each sample and standard were made, and the ALP concentrations \n\nread off directly from the standard curve. \n\n \n\n4.3.5. Extracellular matrix mineralization content by energy dispersive spectroscopy \n\n(EDS) \n\n Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) methodology was used to detect the presence \n\nof calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) elements by analyzing the surface of the constructs. \n\nThese two chemical elements are constituents of the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite) of bone \n\nECM. Their presence positively indicates the formation of mineralized ECM at the surface of \n\nthe constructs. As controls, it was analyzed the surface of unseeded scaffolds immersed in \n\nosteogenic medium for the same time periods, showing that the presence of P and Ca were \n\nthe result of cellular activity. \n\n The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM in subsection 3.1. \n\nThe samples were sputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100) with the purpose of \n\nanalyzing the presence of Ca and P elements at the surface by EDS with a Leica Cambridge \n\nS360 scanning electron microscope. Sputter coating with carbon avoids overlapping of \n\nsignals of the coating with the elements being analyzed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 58\u00a0\n\n4.3.6. Extracellular matrix mineralization crystallinity by fourier transform infra-red \n\nspectroscopy (FTIR) \n\n Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method is used to study the chemical \n\nstructure of a polymer, but it can also be used to analyze the chemical composition of the \n\nsurface of a scaffold. In the present thesis it was used to confirm the results obtained from \n\nEDS analyses, indicating the presence of phosphate and carbonate groups, which are typical \n\nfor carbonated apatite (17). Briefly, constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline and \n\nfixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The samples were pressed into pellets with potassium bromide \n\n(KBr; Riedel-de Haen, Germany) and further analysed by FTIR. The infrared spectrum was \n\nmeasured using a FTIR Spectrometer (model IRPrestige-21, Shimadzu; Germany) in the \n\nwavelength range of 4000\u2013400 cm?1. The same controls (acellular scaffolds) used for the \n\nEDS analysis were used in tests. \n\n \n\n4.3.7. Gene expression analysis of specific osteogenic genes \n\n The constructs cultured in vitro in osteogenic inducing medium were evaluated by \n\nanalyzing the expression of genes encoding specific proteins during osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of hBMSCs. This process is characterized by three sequential periods: \n\nproliferation, ECM maturation and mineralization (18). The osteogenic phenotype is \n\nrecognized by cell maturation coordinated with the secretion of specific proteins, in a process \n\nthat is asynchronously acquired as the progenitor cells successfully differentiate and the \n\nmatrix matures and mineralizes (19). To evaluate the transient state of the stem cells during \n\nthe differentiation process polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, by amplifying \n\nspecific sequences of a target osteogenic specific gene. \n\n \n\n 4.3.7.1. RNA isolation  \n\n\u00a0 Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the constructs was extracted using the Trizol\u00ae \n\n(Invitrogen, Life Technologies Inc., UK) method according to the manufacturer?s protocol. At \n\neach time point, the constructs were washed with phospate buffered saline, immersed in \n\nTrizol and stored at -80\u00baC until further use. Proteins were removed with chloroform extraction \n\nand the RNA pellets were washed once with isopropyl alcohol and once with 70 % ethanol. \n\nThe total RNA pellets were reconstituted in RNAase free water (Gibco, Invitrogen, UK). \n\nDetermination of the RNA concentration for each scaffold replica (triplicates of each scaffold \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 59\u00a0\n\nper time point) was performed by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000, USA). The \n\nintegrity of the RNA samples was checked using agarose 1.2% gel electrophoresis.  \n\n \n\n4.3.7.2. Reverse-transcriptase and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction \n\n In chapter V, it was used non-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain \n\nreaction (PCR). Briefly, aliquots of the total RNA (100 ng/?l) were used to synthesize \n\ncomplementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) and amplified by PCR, in one step RT-PCR \n\nbeads (Amersham Biosciences, USA). The cDNA synthesis was executed by incubating the \n\nreaction mixture 5 min at 25\u00baC, followed by 30 min at 42\u00baC and terminated by an incubation \n\nat 85\u00baC for 5 min, using a termocycler (MyCycler\u2122, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). \n\nSpecific osteogenic gene sequences (primers) were used in PCR reaction. Human \n\nspecific primers used were: for runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin, type I \n\ncollagen, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-\n\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Each cDNA sample was run in triplicate for every PCR. \n\nAmplification was performed using a termocycler (MyCycler\u2122, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). The \n\nfirst reverse transcription step at 42\u00baC for 30 min was followed by a step of denaturation at \n\n95\u00baC during 5 min. After this, 35 cycles of PCR were performed, each consisting of a \n\ndenaturation stage at 95\u00baC for 1 min, annealing at a given temperature accordingly with the \n\nspecific primer used and then an extension stage at 72\u00baC for 2 min. In all cases, a final \n\nextension at 72\u00baC for 5 min was performed before storing the samples at 4\u00baC.  \n\n PCR products were separated by 1% agarose (Biorad, USA) at least twice. The \n\nseparated DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (Sigma, St Louis, \n\nMO) and observed with Eagleye software (Alpha Innotech, USA) using excitation at 514 nm \n\nand emission at 610 nm.  \n\nIn chapter IV, it was used quantitative real-time PCR. This technology presents \n\nseveral advantages over traditional PCR (reverse-transcriptase PCR). The measurement of \n\nthe amount of amplified product is carried out with a quantitative laser-based method, and \n\ndata collection is performed in the early exponential phase of the reaction, when none of the \n\nreagents is rate-limiting. The genes analyzed were Runx2, osterix (OSX), osteocalcin, type I \n\ncollagen, BSP, osteopontin (OPN) and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-\n\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Real time PCR was performed accordingly to the \n\nprotocol from iScript\u2122 cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Succinctly, a \n\nreaction mixture consisting of 1X iScript Reaction Mix, 1 \u00b5l iScript Reverse Transcriptase, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 60\u00a0\n\nRNA template (1 \u00b5g total RNA) and nuclease-free water was prepared, in 40 \u00b5l of total \n\nvolume. The single-strand cDNA synthesis occurred as described for conventional PCR.  \n\nAmplification of the target cDNA for real-time PCR quantification was performed \n\naccording to manufacturer protocol, using 2 \u00b5l RT cDNA products, 1 ?M each primer, 1X iQ \n\nSYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and nuclease-free water, in a final \n\nvolume of 25 ?L. Forty-four cycles of denaturation (95\u00baC, 10 s), annealing (temperature \n\ndependent on the gene, 30 s) and extension (72\u00baC, 30 s) were carried out in the gradient \n\nthermocycler MiniOpticon real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for \n\nall genes. The transcripts expression data were normalized to the housekeeping gene \n\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehygrogenase (GAPDH) for each time point and relative \n\nquantification calculated by the ?CT method. \n\n \n\n5. In vivo studies \n\n In vitro experimentation is limited in recreating the complex in vivo environment, being \n\nmost of the times incapable of predicting in vivo performance in many settings, particularly in \n\ntissue engineering and regeneration of functional tissues.  \n\n All procedures were conducted in accordance with European regulations for animal \n\ntesting (European Union Directive 86/609/EEC).  \n\n \n\n5.1. In vivo tissue response in different locations \n\n This work was developed in chapter IV. Twelve Wistar rats were used. This study was \n\nconducted after receiving approval from the Animal Ethical Committee of the K?r?kkale \n\nUniversity, Ankara, Turkey. The scaffolds (8 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick) were sterilized \n\nby ethylene oxide. Animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a mixture \n\nof ketamine HCl (Parke Davis, 50 mg/ml, Taiwan) and Rompun (2%, Bayer, Germany). The \n\nscaffolds were implanted in 3 different regions per animal:  \n\n (i) single critical size defect with 8 mm diameter in crania;  \n\n (ii) pocket incision between perichondrium and ear cartilage, the scaffold being \nplaced on the 1/3 proximal cartilage of the pocket;  \n\n (iii) incision of 10 mm close to iliac bone, the scaffolds being placed between \n\nperiosteum and iliac bone (onlay model) (21).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 61\u00a0\n\n A total of 3 scaffolds per animal were implanted (one in each location).  In all cases, \n\nthe incisions were closed using 5.0 silk sutures. After one month of implantation, the animals \n\nwere sacrificed and implants were collected with the surrounding tissue and processed for \n\nhistological processing. \n\n \n\n5.2. In vivo degradation studies and evaluation of the host response \n\n In vivo implantation of developed scaffolds was performed in parallel with in vitro \n\ndegradation studies. Biocompatibility is directly related with degradation process of the \n\nscaffolds. This is due to the fact that degradation of a biomaterial implanted in a host is \n\ninfluenced by the presence and recruitment of inflammatory cells and consequently by the \n\nproduction of inflammatory mediators. One of the most important requisites for clinical \n\napplication of a biomaterial is its biocompatibility, that is defined as the ability of a material to \n\nperform with an appropriate host response in a specific application (22). The local reaction of \n\nan implant is studied histologically after a 3 months implantation period, as described in ISO \n\nstandard 10993-6 (23). \n\n For this study, described in chapter VII, Wistar rats were used. Scaffolds were \n\nimplanted subcutaneously and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, samples were retrieved for further \n\nanalysis. Animals were anesthetized by an IP injection of a solution of 75//0.5 mg/kg body \n\nweight ketamine:metedomidine (Imalgene\u00ae:Dorbenvet\u00ae). Subcutaneous (SC) pockets were \n\ncreated and 4 scaffolds were placed in each animal, away from the sutures site (incision) to \n\navoid inflammation of the wound. The anaesthesia was then reverted with a SC injection of \n\n0.25 mg/kg Atipamezol (Antisedan\u00ae). After recovering from anaesthesia, animals were \n\nplaced in their home cages and water and food were supplied ad libitum. Each animal \n\nreceived an SC injection of 1mg/kg analgesic Butorphanol (Torbugesic\u00ae) administered \n\nimmediately after surgery and 24 h later, to avoid post-operative pain. At each time point, 3 \n\nanimals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium penthobarbital, at a lethal \n\ndose and the respective implants were retrieved.  \n\n \n\n5.3. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice \n The in vivo approach should mimic the future clinical application envisaged and the \n\nbone defect must not heal spontaneously, i.e., a critical size defect (CSD) should be created \n\n(20). The work developed was described in detail in chapter VII. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n 62\u00a0\n\n Athymic nude mice were used to examine the healing of cranial critical size bone \n\ndefects filled with transplants of pre-cultured constructs. All procedures involving the use of \n\nanimals were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care \n\nand Use Committee of the Technion, Haifa in Israel. In brief, the in vitro constructs (with \n\n1x106 cells) were cultured in osteogenic inducing medium for 2 weeks prior to implantation. \n\nThe surgery consisted on drilling 2 bilateral critical size circular defects (5 mm diameter and \n\n1mm thick) in the parietal bones of the skull on either side of the sagittal suture line, with a \n\nhand drill and trephine bit. Extremely care was taken to not damage the sagittal suture or to \n\ninterrupt the dura matter beneath the bone. During procedure, sterile saline was dripped over \n\nthe drilling site, in order to avoid extensive heating and to protect brain tissue. Surgeries were \n\nperformed under general anesthesia (xylazine: ketamine 1:1 solution in saline) by IP \n\ninjection. Scaffolds (scaffolds seeded and cultured for 2 weeks with 1x106 hBMSC and \n\nscaffold without cells) were implanted into the defects. A total of 6 nude mice were used and \n\n12 cranial defects were created. Animals were kept under aseptic conditions. After 8 weeks \n\npost-surgery, animals were euthanized and crania were removed, cleaned and fixed \n\nimmediately in formalin to be further analyzed by micro computed tomography analysis. \n\n \n\n5.4. In vivo results analysis \n\n5.4.1. Histological evaluation \n\n Histological sections show the tissue inside of implant as well as the tissue \n\nsurrounding it. To further identify the resident cells of those tissues, sections must be stained \n\nwith specific staining. Retrieved samples at each time point were fixed in 10% neutral \n\nbuffered formalin. The fixed samples were dehydrated and further embedded in paraffin, as \n\ndescribed in subsection 4.3.1. The specimens were sectioned to obtain 3 \u00b5m thick \n\nlongitudinal and transverse sections. \n\n\u00a0\n\n5.4.1.1. Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining \n\n H&amp;E staining is a standard protocol to identify microscopically the morphology of the \n\ncells in tissues. Haematoxylin stains the nucleus with a dark blue color. Eosin stains the \n\ncytoplasm of the cell with a pink colour. Thus, the main cell structures are easily indentified. \n\nA standard protocol for H&amp;E staining was used. Stained sections were observed by light \n\nmicroscopy. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n 63\u00a0\n\n5.4.1.2. Masson\u00b4s trichrome staining \n\n Masson\u00b4s trichrome stain was performed to analyze the amount and distribution of \nmature collagen, differentiating the collagen fibers from smooth muscle and elastin fibers. \n\nSections were stained with Weigert?s haematoxilin at RT, for 5 min and washed with water. \n\nAfter that, slides were stained with ponceau-fucsin solution and washed. Then, slides were \n\nimmersed in phosphomolibdic acid to remove the previous stain. Finally, sections were \n\nstained with light green, washed and immediately placed in ethanol 95% and then in xylene. \n\nFinally, they were mounted with Histofluid (Marienfeld GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany) and \n\nobserved by light microscopy (BX61, Olympus Corporation, Germany) and images captured \n\nwith a digital camera (DP70, Olympus Corporation, Germany). \n\n \n\n5.4.1.3. Immunohistochemistry \n\n Immunohistochemistry principle is based on a highly specific reaction antigen-\n\nantibody, which implies that a determined antibody only reacts with a specific antigen. For \n\nformalin fixed and paraffin embedded sections, the most used protocol involves the use of an \n\nenzyme conjugated with a secondary antibody with specificity to the primary antibody used. \n\nThis enzyme reacts with a specific protein (avidin or streptavidin), which will be revealed by a \n\ndye, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Immunolocalization of a specific antibody is \n\ndetected by a brown staining visible at light microscopy. \n\n Immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) antibody was performed to \n\nevaluate the new vascularization (24). In order to perform immunohistochemistry, paraffin \n\nwas removed. The antigen retrieval was heat induced in a water bath at 96\u00baC for 20 min, with \n\nincubation of the slides in citrate buffer (pH=6). The slides were washed with phosphate \n\nbuffer saline and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) \n\nin methanol, at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. R.T.U. Vectastain\u00ae Universal Elite ABC \n\nKit (Vector, VCPK-7200, USA) was used for antibody incubation, according to the \n\ninstructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, sections were incubated with ?-SMA primary \n\nantibody (Abcam, ab5694, UK) overnight at 4\u00baC, in a humidified atmosphere. After washing \n\nwith phosphate buffered saline, antibody detection was revealed by using the Peroxidase \n\nSubstrate Kit DAB (Vector, VCSK-4100). Slides were washed in water for 5 minutes and then \n\ncounterstained with Harris? haematoxylin for nuclear contrast, at RT for 2 min. After this, \n\nsamples were washed with water, dehydrated in graded ethanol (50, 70, 95 and 100%), \n\ncleared with xylene, and mounted with Histofluid (Marienfeld GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

Cytotoxicity assays were carried out using standard tests \n\n(accordingly to ISO/EN 10993 part 5 guidelines), namely MTS test with a 24 h extraction \n\nperiod, revealing that L929 cells had similar metabolic activities to that obtained for the \n\nnegative control.  \n\n Cell culture studies were conducted using a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line \n\n(BMC9). Cells were seeded onto the scaffold and allowed to proliferate for 3 weeks, under \n\nosteogenic conditions. SEM observations demonstrated that cells were able to proliferate \n\nand massively colonize the scaffolds structure. The cell viability assay MTS demonstrated \n\nthat BMC9 cells were viable after 3 weeks in culture. The cells clearly evidenced a positive \n\ndifferentiation towards the osteogenic lineage, as confirmed by the high ALP activity levels. \n\nMoreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed the presence of Ca and \n\nP in the elaborated extracellular matrix (ECM). \n\n These combined results indicate that the novel melt based chitosan/polyester \n\nscaffolds support the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the mouse \n\nMSCs and shows adequate physicochemical and biological properties for being used as \n\nscaffolds in bone tissue engineering related strategies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n72 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n The last 15 years have witnessed the emergence of a novel multidisciplinary field of \n\nscience called Tissue Engineering that has been in the forefront of a new wave of \n\ntherapeutic/regenerative approaches for a variety of tissues, including bone. Its main \n\npurposes are the production of tissues and organs substitutes/equivalents that can replace or \n\nrestore the natural features and physiological functions of natural tissues in vivo (1, 2).   \n\n The most common approach used in the bone tissue engineering field is based on the \n\nseeding of cells with osteogenic potential, commonly mesenchymal stem cells, on three \n\ndimensional (3D) scaffolds followed either by direct implantation on the injury site or by an in \n\nvitro culturing period upon which the construct is implanted (3). Ultimately, these so-called \n\nbone tissue engineering constructs should have two main functions when implanted in vivo \n\n(4-6): 1) provide structural support until the neotissue can assure it by itself and 2) promote \n\nosteoinduction, meaning in a simplistic way, the promotion of migration and differentiation of \n\nmesenchymal stem and osteoprogenitor cells, which later will lead to new bone formation. \n\nFrom the lines above it can be clearly concluded that 3D scaffolds play a major role within \n\nany bone tissue engineering concept. Ideally these temporary scaffolds should be porous in \n\norder to accommodate cell growth and facilitate both tissue regeneration and vascularization \n\n(1, 2, 7). Furthermore, they should also be biocompatible, mechanically stable under loads \n\nand have a physiologic biodegradation rate similar to the cell/tissue growth rates (1, 2, 7, 8). \n\n Up to now, several materials, such as titanium alloys (9-11), ceramics (12-14) and \n\nbiodegradable polymers (15-18) have been used to obtain these 3D structures. Among those \n\nmaterials, and due to their intrinsic characteristics, biodegradable polymers are those that \n\nhave been used more frequently. The most widely used are poly(?-hydroxy acids), such as \n\npoly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), and their copolymers because they have been already \n\naccepted by regulatory agencies. In spite of the fact that these materials have been \n\nthoroughly studied and extensively used in the clinical practice, it is also true that upon \n\ndegradation they release acidic by-products, which may trigger inflammatory responses and \n\ncompromise the needed integration by the host tissue (19, 20). \n\n Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new biomaterials with \n\nscaffolding potential for bone tissue engineering. It is in this context that natural based \n\npolymers have been put forward in the last few years. Within this group, the polysaccharides, \n\nlike starch (19, 21, 22) and chitosan (23-29) have been highlighted as the most promising, as \n\nthey may act as analogs of polyssacharides present in vivo and adopt their roles (24). An \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n73 \n\nexample of such affinity is the structural similarity observed between chitosan and \n\nglycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (29). Several reports about chitosan (23-29), the alkaline \n\ndeacetylated product of chitin, have shown that this polymer might have a range of \n\ninteresting properties, from biodegradability to biocompatibility, considered to be suitable for \n\nbone tissue engineering scaffolding. Nevertheless, chitosan still presents a challenge when \n\ncompared to other materials, that is, the inability of being processed by means other than by \n\nsolvent based technology, which frequently leads to the development of scaffolds with poor \n\nmechanical properties and insufficient control of its morphology.  \n\n Since 2005, we have developed a new concept based on the development of \n\nthermoplastic chitosan polymers (30-33). This was achieved by melt-blending chitosan with \n\ndifferent aliphatic polyesters, poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), \n\npoly(butylene terephthalate adipate) (PBTA), and poly(butylene succinate adipate) (PBSA). \n\nBy doing this, we conjugated the favourable biological properties of chitosan with the \n\npredictable degradative behavior of the aliphatic polyesters. Further information on the \n\nphysical and chemical properties of these materials can be found in the reports of Correlo et \n\nal. (30-33).  \n\n The present study reports on the morphology, mechanical properties, \n\ncytocompatibility, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mesenchymal stem cell \n\nline - BMC9 - on novel compression molding/salt leaching scaffolds based on blends of \n\nchitosan with PCL, PBS, PBTA and PBSA. Results have showed that the developed \n\nscaffolds had the adequate mechanical properties. Furthermore, they disclosed a non-\n\ncytotoxic behavior and simultaneously supported the growth and osteogenic differentiation of \n\nmouse mesenchymal stem cells within its structure. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Scaffolds production and processing \n\n Chitosan was melt blended with several biodegradable polyesters for the first time by \n\nour group (31) a twin screw extruder with the purpose of producing scaffolds for tissue \n\nengineering applications. For the development of this work, the polyesters compounded with \n\nchitosan (ch) were PBS, PCL and PBTA. In all of these blends there was a rate of 50% (wt%) \n\nchitosan with 50% (wt%) polyester.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n74 \n\n The methodology used for the scaffolds production was melt based compression \n\nmolding followed by salt leaching. The details of the processing conditions are described \n\nelsewhere (32). Briefly, the developed blends were grained and the powder mixed with salt \n\nparticles with sizes between 250 and 500 \u00b5m. The chitosan based blends mixed with salt \n\nwere loaded into a mold that was further heated and compression molded into discs. The salt \n\ncontent was 60% by weight. The discs were cut into 5x5x5 mm3 cubes. These cubes were \n\nthen immersed in distilled water to leach out the salt, dried, sterilized by ethylene oxide and \n\nused for cell culture studies.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Scaffolds characterization \n\n The cross-section of all the developed scaffolds was analyzed using a Leica-\n\nCambridge S-360 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for preliminary assessment on the \n\nscaffolds morphology. All the samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to SEM \n\nobservations. \n\n To investigate the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds, Micro-Computed Tomography \n\nequipment (SkyScan, Belgium) was used as a non-destructive technique. Four scaffolds of \n\neach condition were scanned in high resolution mode of 8.7 \u00b5m x/y/z and an exposure time \n\nof 1792 ms. The energy of the scanner used was 63 keV with 157 \u00b5A current. \u00b5CT scans \n\nfollowed by 3D reconstruction of serial image sections allowed to analyze 3D \n\nmicroarchitecture of the scaffolds, pore morphology as well as the determination of the \n\nporosity. \n\n Uniaxial compression tests were performed on a square cross-section specimen of \n\nscaffolds using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal Machine). A \n\ncrosshead speed of 2 mm/min was used. The values reported were the average of at least \n\nfive specimens. The compressive modulus was determined by selecting the linear region of \n\nthe stress-strain graph. \n\n \n2.3. Cell culture \n\n A fibroblast cell line of rat lung - L929 -, acquired from the european collection of cell \n\ncultures (ECACC), was used for cytotoxicity tests. The cells were grown as monolayers in \n\nDulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium (DMEM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% \n\nfoetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n75 \n\nmixture (10000 U/ml penicillin G sodium; 10000 U/ml streptomycin sulphate; 25 ?g/ml \n\namphotericin B) (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). Trypsin/EDTA (0.25% w/v trypsin/0.02% EDTA, \n\nSigma) was used to detach the cells from the culture flasks before the experiments were \n\nconducted. \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Cell viability assay - MTS test  \n\n           The ratio of material weight to extract fluid was constant and equal to 0.25 g/ml. Latex \n\nrubber and standard culture medium were used as positive and negative controls, \n\nrespectively. Latex rubber is known to have a strong cytotoxic effect leading to extensive cell \n\ndeath. For the positive control the ratio of material outer surface to extraction fluid was 2.5 \n\ncm2/ml. Test material (n=6) and positive control were extracted for 24 h at 37\u00baC, using \n\ncomplete culture medium as extraction fluid. Before the tests, culture medium was removed \n\nand an identical volume (200 ?l) of extraction fluid was added to each well. \n\n Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (n=6) at a density of 1.8x104 cells/well and \n\nincubated for 24 h at 37\u00baC, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. A kit (CellTiter 96 One \n\nsolution Cell Proliferation Assay kit - Promega, Madison, WI) was used and it is based on the \n\nreduction of the substrate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-\n\nsulfofenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), into a brown formazan product by dehydrogenase enzymes \n\nactive in the viable cells. After 72 h, the extraction fluid was removed and 200 ?l of a serum-\n\nfree culture medium without phenol red and MTS, in a proportion of 5:1, was added to each \n\nwell. Cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% \n\nCO2. After this time, optical density (O.D.) was measured with a plate reader (Bio-tek, model \n\nSynergy HTi, USA) at 490 nm. The O.D. values obtained were standardized taking into \n\naccount the values for the negative control. \n\n \n\n2.4. Cell culture studies \n\n2.4.1. Cell seeding and culture \n\n A mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) was used. This conditionally \n\nimmortalized clone was shown to exhibit four mesenchymal cell phenotypes: chondrocyte, \n\nadipocyte, stromal (support osteoclast formation), and osteoblast (34). The cells were grown \n\nas monolayer cultures in a culture medium consisting of DMEM medium, 10% FBS and 1% \n\nantibiotic/antimycotic mixture. When the adequate cell number was obtained, cells at \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n76 \n\npassage 10 were trypsinized, centrifuged and ressuspended in cell culture medium. Cells \n\nwere seeded at a density of 5x105cells/scaffold under static conditions, using for this purpose \n\naliquots of 10 ?L loaded on the top of scaffolds. Two hours after seeding, 1 ml of culture \n\nmedium was added to each well. The cell-seeded scaffolds were maintained in a humidified \n\natmosphere at 37\u00baC, containing 5% CO2, under osteogenic differentiation inducing medium, \n\nduring 21 days. The culture medium consisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone \n\n10-8 M (Sigma), ascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma) and \u00df-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma), and \n\nwas changed every 3 to 4 days until the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Cellular viability assay - MTS test \n\n Cell viability was assessed after 3 h, 7, 14 and 21 days, by using the MTS test. The \n\ncell-seeded scaffolds (n=6) were rinsed in 0.15M phosphate buffered saline (Sigma) and \n\nimmersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent at 5:1 \n\nratio and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After this, \n\n200 ?l (n=6) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) determined at \n\n490 nm.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM \n\n Cell adhesion, morphology and average distribution were observed by SEM. The cell-\n\nseeded scaffolds were washed in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline.  \n\n After rinsing 3 times in phosphate buffered saline, the constructs were dehydrated \n\nusing a series of graded ethyl alcohols (30, 50, 70, 90, 100% ethanol) for 15 minutes each, \n\ntwice. Then, the samples were subjected to 2 changes for 15 minutes each with 100% \n\nhexamethyldisilazane (HDMS; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, USA). Finally \n\nHDMS was removed and let to air dry for 2h. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated \n\nwith gold (JEOL JFC-1100) and analyzed with a Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron \n\nmicroscope. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n77 \n\n2.4.4. Cell adhesion and cell viability by calcein AM staining through confocal laser \n\nmicroscopy  \n\n Cells were incubated with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Oregan, USA). Once inside \n\nthe cells, this compound is hydrolyzed by endogenous esterase into the highly negatively \n\ncharged green fluorescent calcein, which is retained in the cytoplasm. The cell-seeded \n\nscaffolds were sectioned and cell adhesion and viability was observed in the inner regions of \n\nthe scaffolds using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser microscope. \n\n \n\n2.4.5. Histology \n\n Eight-micron-thick sections from the 3 weeks culture of the constructs were cut with a \n\ncryomicrotome (CM 1900; Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and mounted on poly-L-lysine \n\n(Sigma) coated slides. Slides were stained with H&amp;E and observed under optical microscope. \n\n \n\n2.4.6. Alkaline phosphatase quantification \n\n A description of the assay can be found elsewhere (35). Briefly, the level of alkaline \n\nphosphatase (ALP) activity from the constructs (n=3) was quantified by the specific \n\nconversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) into p-nitrophenol (pNP). The cell-\n\nseeded scaffolds were allowed to thaw at room temperature and then were sonicated for \n\nroughly 15 min. The enzyme reaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml \n\nof substrate buffer containing 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNPP. The \n\nsolution was incubated at 37\u00baC for 1 h and the reaction was then stopped by a solution \n\ncontaining 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The optical density was \n\ndetermined at 405 nm. A standard curve was made using pNP values ranging from 0 to 20 \n\n?mol/ml. The results are expressed in ?mol of pNP produced/ml/h. \n\n \n\n2.4.7. Mineralization content by EDS \n\n The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM. The samples were \n\nsputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100), in order to verify the presence of calcium and \n\nphosphate elements with a Leica Cambridge S360 electronic microscope.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Statistical analysis \n\n Statistical evaluation was performed using 2 tailed paired t-student tests, to assess \n\nthe statistical differences between each two groups of different time points.

Pores resulting from the leaching of the NaCl particles \n\nmimic the cubic shape of the porogen used. The scaffolds have a very narrow distribution of \n\npores dimensions coincident with the NaCl particles size. Two dimensional binary images \n\nwere analyzed for total porosity calculations. The porosity values presented in table I are the \n\naverage of the individual porosity of 300 slices per scaffold. For each processing condition, 4 \n\nscaffolds were analyzed. As expected, porosity depended on the amount of porogen used. In \n\nall the cases the porosity was very similar to the amount of salt used.  \n\n \n\n3.2. Mechanical properties \n\n The nominal stress \u2013 nominal strain curves for the developed chitosan-polyester \n\nscaffolds are shown in figure 2. The compressive modulus was calculated as the slope of the \n\nlinear most region of the stress-strain curve prior to the yield point and their value is shown in \n\ntable I. As expected, the shape of the stress-strain curve, and consequently the modulus, \n\nvaries with the type of polyester. Scaffolds with higher and lower compressive modulus are \n\nthe ones obtained using the blends Ch-PBS and Ch-PBTA, respectively. These results are in \n\naccordance with previous results obtained with compact injection molded samples (31). \n\nNevertheless, the compressive modulus of the thermally produced scaffolds is in the range of \n\nthe trabecular bone modulus (36). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

In vitro cytotoxicity tests \n\n In the MTS test (Figure 3), L929 cells produced large amounts of the brown formazan \n\nproduct after incubation with the tested extract. This fact shows that cells had similar \n\nmetabolic activities (about 80%) to those obtained by the negative control and were able to \n\nincorporate and metabolize MTS and hence, showed their viability. Therefore, the leachables \n\nreleased from the tested scaffolds could be considered as non-cytotoxic. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Cytotoxicity results of the 72 h extracts of the Ch-PBS, Ch-PCL and Ch-PBTA \n\nscaffolds. Results are based on optical density measurements, at O.D. of 490 nm and \n\nnormalized for the negative control (n=6; \u00b1sd; p<0.05). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM \n\n Regarding the present experiment, SEM observations allowed to determine that \n\nmouse MSCs were able to adhere to the surface of the chitosan-polyester based scaffolds, \n\nwhere a monolayer of cells could be observed after 1 week in culture (Figures 4a, 4b, 4c). \n\nFurthermore it should be highlighted that there was no pore occlusion by the cells (Figure \n\n4d), which demonstrated the adequacy of the pore size range within the scaffolds (250-500 \n\n?m).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4. SEM micrographs of BMC9 cells adhesion and proliferation, under osteogenic \nstimulation, on the 50% wt Ch-PBS scaffolds after a) 1 b) 2 and c) 3 weeks of culture; on the \n\n50% wt Ch-PCL scaffolds after d) 1 e) 2 and f) 3 weeks of culture and on the 50% wt Ch-PCL \n\nscaffolds after g) 1 h) 2 and i) 3 weeks of culture.  \n\n \n\n By week 2 it was possible to observe a higher degree of colonization, denoting a \n\nmultilayer of cells and the onset of elaboration of extracellular matrix (ECM), at the surface of \n\nall the scaffolds obtained from different chitosan based blends (Figures 4e, 4f). A closer \n\nobservation demonstrated that in the blend composed by chitosan and PBS there was a \n\nhigher degree of proliferation of the cells including the ones in the inner regions of the \n\nscaffolds (Figure 4g). Furthermore, by observing the inside scaffold?s inner regions (Figure 5) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n82 \n\nit was shown that the cells were also capable of colonizing these areas, without occluding the \n\npores of the scaffolds structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Original magnification \n\n100X. \n\n \n\n After 3 weeks, further development of the cell number and surface density were \n\nobserved, indicating that the BMC9 cells massively adhered and proliferated within all the \n\nchitosan based scaffolds, also showing a calcified ECM elaboration (Figure 9).  \n\n The scaffolds composed by Ch-PBS showed cell adhesion and colonization of the \n\nsurface and inner regions (Figure 5), and simultaneously evidencing the elaboration of a \n\nmineralized extracellular matrix, shown by the presence of Ca and P, by EDS analysis \n\n(Figure 9a).  \n\n \n\n3.5. Cell viability by MTS assay/ calcein AM staining \n\n Tracking the survival/activity of the cells seeded on the scaffolds from the time of \n\nseeding until implantation might be helpful for the optimization on the development of bone \n\ntissue engineered constructs (37).  \n\n Results showed that the tested MSCs were able to reduce MTS, showing increasing \n\nmetabolic rates with increasing time of culture (Figure 6), and denoting a high viability and \n\nproliferation profile.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Moreover, with these results it can be established a time dependent cell \n\nproliferation, as it is notorious the presence of a higher number of cells for the latest time \n\nperiod.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Alkaline phosphatase quantification \n\n For all tested blends, ALP activity (Figure 8) increased until the second week, \n\nreflecting probably the early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. After this period, \n\nALP activity decreased, presumably due to the onset of the mineralization process (36), \n\ndenoting in this sense a positive indication of the transient character of the differentiation of \n\nthe cells into the osteogenic lineage. Once more, the best results were evidenced by the \n\nscaffolds produced from the Ch-PBS blend, which showed the higher values of the ALP \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay: supernatants were weekly collected and \nfrozen. After 3 weeks, supernatants were thawed. The results are shown in p-nitrophenol \n\n(?mol/ml/h) as a function of days. On day 7, cells were stimulated with 10 mM \n\nglycerophosphate (Sigma), 50 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 10-8 M dexamethasone \n\n(Sigma). The ALP levels increased, reaching the highest values after 2 weeks in culture (n=6; \n\n\u00b1sd; p<0.05). \n\n \n\n3.7. Mineralization content by EDS analysis \n\n The EDS analysis of the surface of the seeded and cultured scaffolds with mouse \n\nMSCs under osteogenic conditions for 21 days (Figure 9) detected the presence of Ca and P \n\nelements on the surface, being therefore, a clear indication of the formation of a mineralized \n\nECM.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

DISCUSSION \n\n In the last few years, natural based polymers have been presented as biomaterials for \n\ntissue engineered scaffolding. Among these, chitosan has emerged as one of the most \n\npromising, namely by its biodegradability, biocompatibility and its resemblance to GAGs (23). \n\n In this study we report the biological performance, in terms of cell adhesion, \n\nproliferation and differentiation of mouse MSCs seeded and cultured onto the newly \n\ndeveloped chitosan based scaffolds. \n\n The melt based approach used to produce the scaffolds allowed us to obtain 3D \n\nporous structures without the use of organic solvents that could remain in the structure and \n\ndamage the transplanted cells or the surrounding tissues (after transplantation). The \n\nmechanical properties, in terms of compressive modulus, were in the range of those for \n\ntrabecular bone properties (36). \n\n The developed scaffolds revealed to be non-cytotoxic to fibroblast cells, since the \n\nleachables released during the extraction period did not affect cell viability as well as did not \n\ninflict changes in cell morphology. \n\n Cells were able to colonize the scaffolds structure up to periods of 3 weeks. The cell \n\nproliferation was gradual and continuously increasing over time of culture, being more \n\nevident on the ch-PBS scaffolds. The differences observed for the different blends are \n\nprobably related with the different surface chemistry and mechanical properties of the 3D \n\nscaffolds with the best results being noticed for the scaffolds produced from ch-PBS blend.  \n\n It is known that if cells are undergoing osteogenic differentiation, ALP is considered to \n\nbe one of the early markers (38). Although not being specific for the osteoblast lineage, ALP \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on \nnovel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds \n\n86 \n\nis used typically to illustrate the early differentiation into a bone related phenotype, which is \n\nnoticed by the increase of the enzyme activity until the second week.  \n\n The presence of Ca and P elements on the surface of the cell-seeded scaffolds \n\nrevealed the presence of a mineralized ECM. This fact is in agreement with the data obtained \n\nfor alkaline phosphatase experiments, showing that cells had undergone an osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation and were elaborating mineralized ECM. \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\n With the present study it was possible to show that the scaffolds based on 50:50 \n\n(wt%) blends of chitosan and synthetic polyesters (PBS, PCL and PBTA) present a range of \n\nproperties that are considered to be adequate for bone tissue engineering applications. \n\n Scaffolds produced by compression molding followed by salt leaching were shown to \n\nbe non-cytotoxic and clearly cytocompatible. The results of the direct contact assays under \n\nosteogenic conditions revealed that the three types of chitosan-based scaffolds selected for \n\nthis study promoted the attachment and proliferation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells. \n\nFurthermore, they also presented high indexes of alkaline phosphatase activity and the \n\nproduction of a calcified ECM, which is due to the differentiation towards the osteogenic \n\npathway. From the three tested blends, the chitosan-PBS blend showed the best results, \n\nnamely in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation. Nevertheless the other blends also \n\npresented adequate properties for bone tissue engineering. \n\n Due to the good combination of properties and excellent biological performance, it is \n\nstrongly believed that the scaffolds herein proposed will be a valid alternative to the currently \n\nused materials when considering bone regeneration/tissue engineering applications. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n Ana Costa-Pinto was supported by scholarship SFRH/24735/2005 from the \n\nPortuguese research council \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia\u201d (FCT). \n\n This work was partially supported by the EU Integrated Project GENOSTEM (Adult \n\nMesenchymal Stem Cells Engineering for connective tissue disorders: from the bench to the \n\nbed side), and the European Network of Excelence EXPERTISSUES. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Previous results from our group evidenced that chitosan poly(butylene succinate) \n\nmelt based scaffolds showed remarkable biological performance. This fact brought up the \n\nquestion of the role of chitosan in this specific blend. For this purpose scaffolds with 50% of \n\nchitosan (Ch) and 50% poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), 25% of Ch and 75% of PBS and \n\n100% PBS were produced by compression molding and salt leaching. These scaffolds were \n\nevaluated in vitro with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and in vivo \n\nby implanting them in different anatomical regions (cranial defect model, iliac submuscular \n\nand auricular areas) in Wistar rats. Higher percentages of chitosan favoured better biological \n\nperformance, when compared to PBS scaffolds alone. Cells showed enhanced viability over \n\ntime, evidencing superior cell adhesion and proliferation. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase \n\n(ALP) activity and gene expression showed that cells were undergoing osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation in chitosan containing scaffolds. For all in vitro studies, PBS scaffolds \n\npresented inferior biological performance when compared to chitosan based scaffolds. \n\n Scaffolds displayed a normal and mild inflammatory response after one month \n\nimplantation and integrated well with the surrounding tissues. Connective tissue cells \n\ncolonized the scaffolds structures. Tissue responses were milder in auricular and calvaria \n\nimplantations when compared to the submuscular. Chitosan scaffolds evidenced better \n\nresults, with enhanced cell penetration, without cell necrosis and large number of blood \n\nvessels in the proximity and inside the scaffolds.  \n\n The addition of chitosan positively influenced the osteogenic differentiation of \n\nhBMSCs, and also showed enhanced tissue biocompatibility, as compared to PBS alone. \n\nConsidering the results herein reported it is reasonable to state that chitosan-PBS scaffolds \n\ndemonstrate appropriate properties both in vitro and in vivo to be used in bone tissue \n\nengineering applications. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n94 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n A new field known as Tissue Engineering has recently emerged, having potential to \n\novercome the increasing number of clinical needs for bone regeneration mainly due to the \n\naging of population. This multidisciplinary approach involves the basic principles of \n\nengineering and life sciences, in order to develop biological substitutes aimed at restore, \n\nmaintain or improve a tissue function or a whole organ (1). Firstly, a tissue construct is \n\ncreated, using cells and scaffolds. This scaffold is further matured in vitro, and then \n\ntransplanted and integrated into the host defect site (2). Frequently, the cells are seeded and \n\ncultured onto a natural or synthetic biodegradable scaffold. The ideal scaffold must fulfill a \n\nnumber of requirements that include being biocompatible with specific biodegradability \n\nkinetics and should possess adequate porosity, pore size and mechanical properties \n\ncompatible with the loads to which will be subjected (3).  \n\n Among the various natural polymers available, chitosan has emerged as a candidate \n\nbiomaterial to produce biodegradable scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. The first \n\nreport about the partially deacetylated form of chitin (chitosan) dates back from the 19th \n\ncentury (4). Chitosan presents biological properties that makes it appropriated to develop \n\nscaffolds for tissue engineering, including its biodegradability (5, 6), antibacterial activity (7, \n\n8), haemostatic and wound healing properties (9, 10), biocompatibility (11, 12) and easy \n\naccessibility. It is a linear polysaccharide composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl \n\nglucosamine with a ? (1-4) link (13). Chitosan has a cationic character, which allows \n\nelectrostatic interactions with anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans. \n\nMoreover, the chemical structure of chitosan has similarities with the structure of GAGs (14). \n\nThese molecules play an important role in the modulation of cell function, morphology and \n\ndifferentiation.(13).  \n\n Interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide essential cues used \n\nby the cells to influence and adapt its intra and extracellular environment (15). Chitosan by \n\nitself or in combination with other biomaterials has been reported to have a positive effect \n\nover the cell behavior. Polystyrene coated with chitosan solution has shown cytocompatibility \n\nas a substrate for growth of human osteoblasts and chondrocytes (16). Poly-(L-lactide acid) \n\n(PLLA) films modified with chitosan evidenced improved cell adhesion, proliferation and \n\nbiosynthetic activity, using articular chondrocytes (17). Commercially available chitosan \n\nsupports the initial attachment and spreading of osteoblasts preferentially over fibroblasts \n\n(18). MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic-like cells proliferated and evidenced increased alkaline \n\nphosphatase activity, as well as up-regulation of osteogenic gene expression, in composite \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n95 \n\nchitosan/poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) scaffolds as compared to poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) \n\nscaffolds (19). In fact, in a recent study by Wu and co-workers, different proportions of \n\npoly(caprolactone)/chitosan scaffolds evidenced better results for the blends with higher \n\nchitosan content, using rat osteoblasts (20). Moreover, nanofibrous scaffolds containing \n\nchitosan revealed that stem cells adhere, proliferate and express phenotypic markers of \n\nosteogenic differentiation in a superior level than synthetic nanofibrous scaffolds without \n\nchitosan (21, 22). It has been described in the literature that combined chitosan\u2013collagen \n\nmatrices, with higher proportion of chitosan promoted osteoblastic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand improved the mechanical and physical properties of the sponges (23). Previous studies \n\nfrom our group, using chitosan particle aggregated scaffolds, evidenced good results favoring \n\nosteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of adipose derived stem cells (24). Another work \n\nfrom our group reported that discs composed of chitosan-PBS and other biodegradable \n\npolyesters, obtained by injection molding, showed that chitosan had a positive effect over \n\nosteoblast-like cells activity in vitro (25). \n\n Chitosan is difficult to be processed by methods that do not require the use of \n\nsolvents. Accordingly, there is the need to combine it with other polymers to improve its \n\nprocessability. By this combination, the mechanical properties of the resulting biomaterial can \n\nalso be improved to become adequate for load bearing tissues, such as bone (26). \n\nPreviously, we proposed a methodology to process chitosan with aliphatic polyesters, \n\nfacilitating its processing by melt and avoiding the need of solvents (27, 28). This processing \n\nroute involves melt-based compression molding followed by particle leaching. Details about \n\nthis technique were described elsewhere (28). Briefly, several aliphatic polyesters in different \n\npercentages were blended with chitosan. These various scaffold formulations were evaluated \n\nin vitro for osteogenic applications, using a mouse MSC cell line (BMC9). The composition \n\nhaving chitosan\u2013PBS (50% wt) evidenced the strongest results, in terms of both cell \n\nadhesion and proliferation (29). These results raised the question of why this specific blend \n\nshows such enhanced cell behavior. We herein addressed this important question by \n\nstudying different blends with two different concentrations of chitosan: chitosan-PBS (25-75% \n\nwt) and chitosan-PBS (50% wt), as well as, without chitosan, with only PBS (100% wt), with \n\nhuman MSCs seeded and cultured in osteogenic conditions. In vivo tissue response was \n\nevaluated by implanting scaffolds with the extreme compositions, chitosan-PBS (50% wt) and \n\nscaffolds without chitosan (PBS 100) in Wistar rats. The implantation locations were defined \n\nto evaluate the inflammatory response in regions with different degrees of vascularization. \n\nThe regions were the cranial bone that is a region with relevance for the intended application, \n\nsubmuscular, a highly vascularized location and auricular area, which is a region with lower \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. Scaffolds processing  \n\n The aim of this specific study required the production of scaffolds with different \n\ncompositions of chitosan and PBS. Namely, we produced scaffolds having 100% of polyester \n\n(PBS 100); 25% of chitosan and 75% of PBS (Ch-PBS 25-75); and 50% of chitosan and 50% \n\nPBS (Ch-PBS 50-50). In both cases, the composition is in a weight basis.  \n\n Chitosan and PBS powder were melt blended by extrusion. The extrudate was \n\nsubsequently grinded into powder. This powder was physically mixed with NaCl particles with \n\ncontrolled sizes (obtained by sieving) and processed by compression molding into large \n\ndiscs. These large discs were subsequently sectioned to obtain the required geometry for the \n\nfinal scaffolds. The sectioning was performed using a CNC equipment (3D Plotter MDX-20 \u2013 \n\nRoland), which allows cutting solid objects in a controlled and reproducible manner. In a first \n\nstage, the outer skin of the large disk produced initially by compression molding was \n\nremoved. A plate with the final required thickness was obtained from where smaller discs \n\nwere cut with the desired geometries to be used as scaffolds. A subsequent salt leaching \n\nprocess was performed by immersion in water during a sufficient period to allow all NaCl \n\nparticles to be dissolved and leached out. In this way, porous scaffolds with controlled \n\ngeometry are obtained. Specific details of the processing conditions are described elsewhere \n\n(28). Taking into account the final applications, we herein produced discs with diameters of 8 \n\nmm and two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm. Finally, the discs intended to be used in \n\nfurther cell culture studies or for in vivo implantation were sterilized by ethylene oxide. \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Scaffolds characterization by micro computed tomography (\u00b5CT) \n\n A micro computed tomography equipment \u00b5CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, \n\nKnotich, Belgium) was used to analyze the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds. Three \n\nscaffolds of each formulation were scanned in high-resolution, using a resolution pixel size of \n\n8.79 \u00b5m and exposure time of 1.792 ms. The energy of scanner was selected to use 63 keV \n\nand 157 \u00b5A current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a rotation range of \n\n180\u00ba with a rotation step of 0.45\u00ba. \u00b5CT scans were reconstructed using a cone-beam \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n97 \n\nreconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, also from SkyScan). Representative data sets of \n\n200 sections were segmented into binary images with a dynamic threshold of 150 to 255 \n\n(grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis including porosity, pore \n\ninterconnectivity and mean pore size (CT analyzer, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to reconstruct 3D \n\nmodels (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Mechanical tests  \n\n Compression tests were performed for determining the compressive modulus of the \n\ndeveloped scaffolds using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal \n\nMachine, USA). Tests were performed using a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min until 60% of \n\nstrain was reached. Tested scaffolds were cylinders of approximately 8 mm in diameter and \n\n3 mm in thickness. The results presented are the average of testing at least five specimens. \n\nThe compressive modulus was determined by selecting the most linear region of the stress-\n\nstrain graph. \n\n \n\n2.2. Cell studies \n\n The biological performance of the scaffolds was assessed by in vitro assessment of \ncell adhesion, viability and osteogenic differentiation. Biocompatibility was analyzed by \n\nimplanting the scaffolds in different body regions of Wistar rats. The parameters and \n\nconditions used in those tests will be described in detail in the current section. \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Cell seeding and cell culture \n\nHuman bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) cells were grown in a \n\nculture medium consisting of alpha medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% fetal bovine serum \n\n(Biochrom AG, Germany), 5 mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast \n\ngrowth factor (bFgF) (PeproTech, USA) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. \n\nLouis, MO).  When an adequate cell number was obtained, cells at passage 2 were detached \n\nwith trypsin/EDTA. Cells were seeded by means of a cell suspension at a density of 2.8x105 \n\ncells/scaffold under dynamic conditions (orbital shaker), during 24 h. The constructs were \n\nplaced in new 24-well plates and 1 ml of osteogenic medium was added to each well. The \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n98 \n\nosteogenic culture medium consisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone 10-8 M \n\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and \u00df-\n\nglycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The cell-constructs were cultured for \n\nperiods of up to 7, 14 and 21 days in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00baC, containing 5% CO2. \n\nThe culture medium was changed every 2 to 3 days until the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Cell viability  \n\n Cell viability was assessed after 7, 14, and 21 days using the MTS test. The cell-\n\nscaffold constructs (n=3) were rinsed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline solution (Sigma, \n\nUSA), and immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS \n\nreagent in a 5:1 ratio. After that, the samples were incubated during 3 hours at 37\u00baC in a \n\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The optical density (O.D.) was measured on a \n\nmicroplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Cell adhesion and morphology - scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\n The adhesion, morphology and spatial distribution of cells on the scaffolds were \n\nanalyzed by SEM. The constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline solution and \n\nfixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. After that, the constructs were dehydrated with increasing \n\npercentages of ethanol and let to air dry. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated with \n\ngold (JEOL JFC-1100) and analyzed using a SEM Leica Cambridge S360. \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Early osteogenic marker - alkaline phosphatase  \n\n Samples were collected as previously described. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity \n\nof the constructs (n=3) was measured by the specific conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate \n\n(pNpp) (Sigma, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The constructs were thawed at room \n\ntemperature and sonicated during 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was set up by mixing 100 \n\n\u00b5l of the sample with 300 \u00b5l of substrate buffer containing 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) \n\nand 2 mg/ml of pNpp. The solution was further incubated at 37\u00baC during 1 hour and the \n\nreaction was stopped by the addition of a solution containing 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared using \n\npNp values ranging from 0 to 20 ?mol/ml.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Osteogenic gene expression -\u2013 real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) \n\n Samples were collected after 7, 14 and 21 days of culture and Trizol\u00ae (Invitrogen, Life \n\nTechnologies Inc., UK) was added to the constructs and immediately placed at -80\u00baC. Total \n\nRNA was isolated from cells with Trizol according to the manufacturer protocol. A NanoDrop \n\nmicrospectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Alfagene, USA) was used \n\nto measure the total RNA concentration. The integrity of the RNA samples was checked \n\nusing denaturing agarose 1.2% gel electrophoresis. \n\n The real time PCR analysis used in this work consisted of a two-step fluorogenic \n\nassay using the SyberGreen system (BioRad, USA). All the reagents used in this procedure \n\nwere obtained from Bio-Rad in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.  \n\n cDNA synthesis was performed using iScriptTMcDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, USA). \n\nBriefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using a reaction mixture consisting of 1X iScript \n\nReaction Mix, 1?L iScript Reverse Transcriptase, RNA template (1 ?g of total RNA) and \n\nnuclease-free water was prepared to a final reaction volume of 40 ?L. After that stage, the \n\nobtained cDNA was used as template for the amplification of the genes.

Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n100 \n\n Each real time PCR run was carried out with an initial incubation at 95\u00baC for 10 min \n\nfollowed by forty cycles of denaturation (95\u00baC, 10 s), annealing (temperature accordingly with \n\nthe specific primer used, 30 s) and extension (72\u00baC, 30 s) in the gradient thermocycler \n\nMiniOpticon real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, USA). At the end of each cycle, the \n\nfluorescent products were detected and quantified. \n\n GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene and the expression of all the target \n\ngenes was normalized to the GAPDH of that sample in the respective time point. The \n\nobtained results were further analyzed with CFX Manager Software \u2013 version 1.5 (BioRad, \n\nUSA).  \n\n \n\n2.3. Animal model and surgical protocols \n\n Twelve Wistar rats weighing between 250-300 g were used in the in vivo studies. All \n\nrats were fed ad libitum during the experiments. The animals were maintained in a \n\ntemperature and humidity controlled environment at the animal research center of Hacettepe \n\nUniversity. The study was conducted after receiving approval from the Animal Ethical \n\nCommittee of the K?r?kkale University. A sterile surgical technique was applied \n\nthroughout the surgical procedures. The scaffolds (8 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick) were \n\npreviously sterilized by ethylene oxide. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection \n\nwith a mixture of ketamine HCl (Parke Davis, 50 mg/ml, Taiwan) and Rompun (2%, Bayer, \n\nGermany). The implantation site of the tested animals was shaved and disinfected with \n\nBaticon solution (Droksan, 10%, Turkey). The scaffolds were implanted in 3 different \n\nanatomical regions (Figure 1) to analyze the inflammation extent in zones with different \n\ndegrees of vascularization:  \n\n(i) Cranial critical size defect: the periosteum was pulled back from the cranial \n\nsurface, the cranial bone was removed by using a circular driller and the scaffold \n\nwas immediately placed in the defect (inlay model), covered by the periosteum; \n\n(ii)  Auricular \u2013 ear: a pocket was made between the perichondrium and the ear \n\ncartilage and the scaffold was placed on the 1/3 proximal cartilage in the pocket;  \n\n(iii) Submuscular: an incision of 10 mm was made to reach the iliac bone. The \n\nscaffold was placed between the periosteum and the iliac bone (onlay model). A \n\ntotal of 3 scaffolds per animal were implanted.  In all cases, the incision was \n\nclosed using 5.0 silk sutures.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Statistical analysis \n\n Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistic software (Release 15.0.0 \nfor Windows). A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to ascertain about the data normality and \n\nvariance equality. The normality was strongly rejected and for the results obtained for cell \n\nviability and ALP assays, the non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis followed by Tukey?s HSD \n\ntest was applied to compare the three independent groups of samples for each variable. P \n\nvalues lower than 0.01 were considered statistically significant in the analysis of the results. \n\nIn the case of gene expression results, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. \n\n  \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Scaffolds characterization by \u00b5CT \n\n The morphological analysis of the scaffolds was performed by \u00b5CT, by reconstructing \n\nscaffolds? tridimensional morphology (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n102 \n\n The qualitative analysis of scaffolds morphology showed the consistency of the \n\nporous morphology of the produced scaffolds. The material composition does not affect the \n\nmorphology and structure of the scaffolds developed by compression molding followed by \n\nsalt leaching.  \n\n Individual 2D analysis of the binary images obtained along the scaffold cross-section \n\nconsisting of 300 slices was carried out for morphometric calculations (Table II).  \n\n  \n\nTable II.

The level of interconnectivity of the porosity ranges from 86.8\u00b11.9% to 92.8\u00b10.9%, \n\nwhich is adequate to allow the diffusion of cells into the inner regions of the scaffolds. The \n\npercentage of porosity was directly proportional to the quantity of the porogen used \n\n(approximately 60%), with a small but not statistically significant increase for higher \n\npercentages of chitosan. Pore sizes were in general lower than the size range of the salt \n\nparticles used. This is maybe due to the fact that compression molding process tends to \n\nbreak down some salt particles, resulting in a pore size in the scaffolds slightly lower than the \n\noriginal size of the porogen particles (28). The pore range of 100-250 \u00b5m was already shown \n\nin literature to be suitable for bone regeneration (30). The values for the compressive \n\nmodulus of the various scaffolds are also shown in Table II.  \n\n We observed that the formulation with lower chitosan content (25% wt) has the lowest \n\ncompressive modulus of all produced scaffolds. The formulation with higher amount of \n\nchitosan (50% wt) shows the highest elastic modulus. However, it should be noted that the \n\npore size and level of porosity, as well as the interconnectivity of the scaffolds produced with \n\nformulations including chitosan have consistently larger values. These differences in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n103 \n\nmorphology may be responsible for the lower level of reinforcement achieved with chitosan \n\ncompounds in this study. The mechanical properties are within the levels required for its \n\napplication, as scaffolds for bone regeneration, since its values are compatible with those of \n\ntrabecular bone (31).  \n\n \n\n3.2. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM \n\n The morphology of the cells and the extent of cell adhesion were analyzed by SEM \n\n(Figure 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 3. SEM micrographs showing the morphology of the seeded and cultured hBMSCs \nafter 1, 2 and 3 weeks in PBS 100 scaffolds (a, b and c); Ch-PBS 25-75 (d, e and f); and Ch-\n\nPBS 50-50 (g, h and i), respectively. \n\n Cells adhered in larger numbers to the chitosan containing scaffolds (Figures 3d and \n\n3g) when compared to the PBS formulation (Figure 3a). Practically no cell colonization is \n\nvisible in PBS 100 scaffolds (Figures 3a, 3b and 3c) for all time points. The formulation Ch-\n\n101the cultured scaffolds (Figures 3e and 3f). The stronger results in terms of cell adhesion \n\nwere obtained for the formulation with the highest percentage of chitosan, showing that the \n\npresence of chitosan promoted cell adhesion and proliferation over time. Those results \n\nconfirm our previous data (29) and clearly indicate a positive influence of chitosan over the \n\nadhesion and proliferation of hBMSCs seeded on the scaffolds. A study with chitosan-\n\ncoralline scaffolds with a similar porosity evidenced a similar cell behavior (32). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Cell viability \n\n Cell viability results (Figure 4) corroborate the SEM observation, showing that higher \n\nchitosan content has a positive influence on the viability of hMSCs. The absolute values \n\nobtained for chitosan based scaffolds were indeed high (Figure 4). At all time points, Ch-PBS \n\n25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50 displayed significantly higher cell viability than PBS 100. After 7 \n\nand 14 days of culture, Ch-PBS 50-50 scaffolds shown a significantly higher amount of cell \n\nviability than Ch-PBS 25-75. After 21 days of culture, no significant difference was obtained \n\nbetween Ch-PBS 25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50. For PBS 100 scaffolds, the values of viability \n\nwere quite low for all time points and even decreased with time, which correlates with the \n\nSEM images showing almost no cells at the surface of the scaffolds. The Ch-PBS 25-75 \n\nformulation evidenced increasing cell viability with time, even though the highest value \n\nobtained after 21 days of culture is still lower than the one obtained for the first time point (7 \n\ndays) of the Ch-PBS 50-50 formulation. Ch-PBS 50-50 evidenced the highest values of cell \n\nviability, although there is a slight decrease of cell viability corresponding to the longer time \n\npoint. This may be explained by the surface of the scaffold being already fully covered by the \n\ncells at this longer time point.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n105 \n\n3.4. Early osteogenic marker- ALP \n\n ALP activity has been used as an indicator of osteogenic cell differentiation (33, 34). \nThis membrane bound enzyme, which is expressed at relatively high levels in the \n\nosteoblasts, has long been recognized as a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, since it has \n\nbeen implicated in the mineralization process (35). ALP is upregulated in the early stages of \n\nbiomineralization in order to form a large pool of inorganic phosphate, from which the ECM \n\ncan be mineralized (36). An increasing ALP activity was observed over time for all scaffolds \n\nformulations. Similar trends were also observed for hMSCs cultured onto collagen-HA (37), \n\nsilk (38) and chitosan (21, 23) 3D scaffolds. As expected from the SEM analysis and by data \n\nobtained from the viability tests, the seeded PBS 100 scaffolds presented the lowest values \n\nof ALP (Figure 5), corroborating the low cell adhesion detected in those scaffolds (Figures \n\n3a, 3b and 3c). \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Osteogenic differentiation - gene expression \n\n Bone cell differentiation is characterized by three different periods: proliferation, ECM \nmaturation and mineralization (39). The osteogenic phenotype is recognized by cell \n\nmaturation coordinated with the secretion of specific proteins, in a process that is \n\nasynchronously acquired and/or lost as the progenitor cells differentiate and the matrix \n\nmatures and mineralizes (40). A preferred method to evaluate the transient state of the stem \n\ncells during differentiation is by analyzing gene expression profile during its culture in \n\nosteogenic differentiating conditions, as shown in Figure 6. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Gene expression for the formulation PBS 100 was \n\nnot analyzed, due to the fact that these scaffolds did not support cell adhesion in sufficient \n\namounts to obtain the quantity of mRNA to synthesize the minimum cDNA. The genes \n\nanalyzed included Runx-2, Osterix, Alkaline phosphatase, Osteopontin, Bone Sialoprotein \n\nand Osteocalcin. The relative quantification of each gene was normalized against the \n\nexpression of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) for each time point. A constitutive expression \n\nof all mRNA transcripts was detected during the 21 days of the experiment. Runx-2 is \n\nexpressed in an early multipotential mesenchymal cell population that can give rise to \n\nchondrogenic, osteogenic, and dentinogenic tissues as well as other lineages (41). Both \n\nchitosan scaffolds formulations presented a similar Runx-2 expression trend, with minor \n\nvariation over time. Osterix is a transcription factor that is expressed in osteoblasts of all \n\nendochondral and membranous bones (42), acting during the stage of commitment of the \n\nosteoprogenitor cell into a pre-osteoblast (43). This gene was expressed in comparable \n\nlevels for both Ch-PBS 25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50 scaffolds. Osteocalcin gene is considered \n\nan important marker of the mineralization phase, reaching its maximum level before or during \n\nthis process (39). In the present work this gene reached its maximum at 14 days of culture \n\nfor both types of scaffolds. Osteopontin is one of the most abundant non-collagenous \n\nproteins in bone, binding to various extracellular molecules, including type I collagen, \n\nfibronectin or osteocalcin and contributes to the physical strength of the extracellular matrices \n\n(44). Osteopontin mRNA peak was at 14 days of hBMSCs culture, determining the end of the \n\nmatrix deposition and the initiation of the mineralization stage. Higher values were obtained \n\nfor Ch-PBS 50-50 formulation. Both osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNA maximum transcripts \n\ndetermine the presence of mature ostoblasts and the beginning of the mineralization. \n\nAlkaline phosphatase is localized in the plasma membrane of osteoblasts and although its \n\nprecise function is not clearly understood, there are studies suggesting its involvement in \n\nmineralization process (33). It is an enzyme expressed by osteoblasts and it is considered a \n\nmarker of osteogenic differentiation (45). Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be \n\nresponsible for the cleavage of pyrophosphate, a molecule that binds to hydroxyapatite \n\ncrystals preventing further incorporation of phosphate into the crystals (46). This mRNA \n\ntranscript evidenced opposed trends for the different scaffolds formulations, i.e., for Ch-PBS \n\n25-75, ALP expression decreased with time, whereas for Ch-PBS 50-50 increased with time, \n\nalso presenting higher absolute values for the latest culture periods. Bone sialoprotein is an \n\nadhesive bone ECM protein exclusively associated with mature osteoblasts and suggested to \n\nbe also involved in the mineralization phase of bone formation (47). This mRNA transcript \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n108 \n\nshowed a similar profile for both types of scaffolds, increasing from 7 to 14 days and with a \n\nslight decrease at 21 days. This decrease can be considered relative, given the standard \n\ndeviation associated. This is in accordance of what was expected, since this protein is \n\nexpressed by mature osteoblasts (43). The whole set of genes consistently upregulated, \n\nstrongly evidences a successful osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs at the surface of \n\nchitosan containing scaffolds. \n\n  \n\n3.6. Host tissue response to the implanted scaffolds \n\n  The implantation of a biomaterial scaffold in a tissue is performed to verify the local \n\neffects on host tissues. The biocompatibility of a device in a tissue is assessed in terms of \n\nacute and chronic inflammatory responses, granulation tissue development, foreign body \n\nhost reaction and potential of integration of the implanted scaffold with host tissue (49). The \n\nevaluation of the local pathological effects was carried out at both tissue level (macroscopic) \n\nand at microscopic level. The histological evaluation is used to characterize various important \n\nbiological response parameters (50).  \n\n The tissue biocompatibility was evaluated in vivo by implanting Ch-PBS 50-50 and \n\nPBS 100 scaffolds in relevant tissue locations, including hard tissue in the cranial defect \n\n(Figure 7) and soft tissues in auricular (Figure 8) and submuscular (Figure 9) regions. The \n\nCh-PBS 25-75 condition was excluded based on the in vitro results, since this condition \n\nevidenced a similar performance to Ch-PBS 50-50 and to minimize the number of animals \n\nused. All surgical incisions healed without evidence of infection or other complications. \n\nRetrieved implants showed no signs of serious inflammation.  \n\n Tissue reaction to an implanted biomaterial is often characterized by an initial acute \n\ninflammatory response, with the presence of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs or neutrophils) \n\nthat migrate from blood to the tissue (51). Acute inflammation is the immediate response to \n\ninjury and most of the times destroy the foreign material. However, the implant may act as a \n\npersistent stimulus to inflammation, and the host response will evolve into a chronic \n\ninflammation response. The chronic inflammation is associated to angiogenesis, fibrosis or \n\neventually, tissue necrosis (52). The leukocyte infiltration is composed by lymphocytes, \n\nmacrophages and plasma cells, that in combination with angiogenesis and fibroplasia \n\nconstitutes the granulation tissue (53). This chronic reaction has also another particularity, \n\nthe possibility of recruiting giant cells (G), formed by macrophage fusion, mostly associated \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n109 \n\nto the failure of phagocytosis of large particles released from the device (54). This reaction is \n\ndenominated by foreign body reaction (FBR).  \n\n After one month of implantation, an invasion of host cells throughout the implanted \n\nporous structures was visible for all tissue locations (Figures 7, 8 and 9). The implanted \n\nscaffolds caused mild inflammation, characterized by infiltration of mononuclear phagocytic \n\ncells, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and some polymorphonuclear leukocytes in \n\nhard and soft tissues at the implantation site. For each implantation location:  \n\n \n\ni) Cranial defect  \n\n Both types of scaffolds were placed in close contact with the cortical bone of the \n\ncalvaria. It is visible a significant ingrowth of connective tissue cells into the scaffolds porous \n\nstructure (Figures 7a and 7d). Furthermore, new blood vessels were present (Figures 7b and \n\n7e) and collagen is present in both type of scaffold (Figures 7c and 7f) formulations but in a \n\nhigher amount for chitosan based scaffolds (Figures 7c). Foreign body giant cells were \n\nobserved, being more pronounced for chitosan based scaffolds (Figure 7b) and it was \n\nalready reported that chitosan may induce the formation of granulation tissue in vivo (55).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

This lower tissue response may be in part related to the fact that ear tissue is not \n\nintensely vascularized. PBS scaffolds evidenced lower cell colonization (Figures 8d and 8e), \n\nthan Ch-PBS scaffolds. At high magnifications it was possible to observe cell necrosis inside \n\nthe pores of PBS implants (Figure 8e). On the other hand, it was visible a massive \n\ncolonization of inflammatory giant cells in chitosan implants (Figure 8b). Previous results \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \n\nand in vivo tissue response  \n\n112 \n\ninflammatory cells, namely neutrophils (Figure 9). This result may be due to the fact that this \n\nparticular region has higher tissue vascularization, as well as higher tissue stresses caused \n\nby locomotion. Ch-PBS scaffolds evidenced robust infiltration by the host cells (Figures 9a \n\nand 9b), compared to PBS scaffolds that showed also in this implantation site some cell \n\nnecrosis inside the implant (Figures 9d and 9f). Residual neutrophils were present in Ch-PBS \n\nscaffold implants (Figure 9b) caused by the presence of chitosan that is known to be \n\nattractive to neutrophils upon implantation (12, 57). It was also visible more collagen in \n\nchitosan based scaffolds (Figure 9c) in comparison with the PBS ones, where only residual \n\ncollagen is observed (Figure 9f). \n\n \n\nFigure 9.

Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs \nand in vivo tissue response \n\n113 \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\n Different chitosan and poly(butylene succinate) formulations were used to produce \nscaffolds by compression molding followed by salt leaching. The aim was to study the \n\ninfluence of chitosan over the viability, adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and \n\nin vivo tissue biocompatibility. Chitosan based scaffolds evidenced superior results in terms \n\nof in vitro cell performance, with PBS 100 scaffolds showing consistently inferior results. \n\n Overall, a higher content of chitosan induce a stronger cellular performance in terms \n\nof cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, when using the produced scaffolds for the \n\nstrategy presented in this work. \n\n For all types of scaffolds tested in vivo, the tissue response was lower in calvaria and \n\nin auricular implantations when compared to the submuscular region. Chitosan based \n\nscaffolds evidenced more cell penetration, without any signs of cell necrosis. Furthermore, \n\nmany blood vessels were observed in the immediacy of the scaffolds. A chronic inflammatory \n\nresponse without fibrosis was developed. Therefore, it is concluded that chitosan exerts a \n\nstrongly positive effect over the cell performance in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, the \n\ndeveloped chitosan based scaffolds are strong candidates to be used in the bone tissue \n\nengineering field. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n\u00a0 Ana Costa-Pinto was supported by scholarship SFRH/24735/2005 from the \n\nPortuguese research council \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia\u201d (FCT).

Cells \n\nwere able to reduce MTS and demonstrated increasing metabolic rates over time. SEM \n\nobservations showed cell colonization at the surface as well as within the scaffolds. The \n\npresence of mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) was successfully demonstrated by peaks \n\ncorresponding to calcium and phosphorous elements detected in the EDS analysis. A further \n\nconfirmation was obtained when carbonate and phosphate group peaks were identified in \n\nFourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra. Moreover, by Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR \n\nanalysis it was observed the expression of osteogenic gene markers, namely Runt related \n\ntranscription factor 2 (Runx2), type 1 collagen, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin. \n\n Chitosan-PBS (Ch-PBS) biodegradable scaffolds support the proliferation and \n\nosteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs cultured at their surface in vitro, enabling future in vivo \n\ntesting for the development of bone tissue engineering therapies.  \n\n \n\n1.INTRODUCTION \n\nMesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow stroma have the \n\ncapacity to differentiate into cells of connective tissues, namely into osteoblasts, \n\nchondrocytes and adipocytes (1-4). However, recent studies (5), indicate that they may have \n\na much broader differentiation potential. Accordingly, the multipotential capacity of MSCs, \n\ntheir accessible origin, high ex vivo expansive potential, and ethical acceptance, make these \n\ncells attractive tools for tissue engineering and cell-based therapies.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n \n\n122 \n\nAnnually, more than 2.2 million bone grafting procedures (autologous bone graft and \n\nbanked bone) are performed worldwide to ensure adequate bone healing in many skeletal \n\nproblems, such as nonunion fractures, cervical and lumbar spine fusion, joint arthrodesis, \n\nrevision arthroplasty (6). Unfortunately, the gold standard of bone grafting (autologous bone) \n\nrequires an extra surgery to retrieve it from the patient. This leads to an increase in surgical \n\nand recovery times. Potential complications, such as chronic pain at the donor site, \n\ninfections, and eventual disability (7) can occur. Tissue engineering offers a strategy to \n\ncircumvent those problems. The concept involves the use of a porous and biodegradable \n\nscaffold, allowing cells to adhere and proliferate, creating conditions for the formation of \n\nECM-like structures (8-10). Previous studies have shown that natural based polymers such \n\nas starch (11-18) or chitosan (19-28) have great potential for bone tissue engineering \n\napplications. The main advantages of these materials include low immunogenic potential, \n\nbioactive behavior, good interaction with host tissues, chemical versatility and high \n\navailability in nature (7).  \n\nChitosan has already shown a range of properties, including its non-antigenicity (24) \n\nand cytocompatibility (21, 29), that suggest having adequate properties for  bone tissue \n\nengineering applications. However the material offers limited versatility in its processability. \n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose a novel methodology to process chitosan by \n\ncompounding this material with biodegradable aliphatic polyesters (26). The blend combines \n\nthe favorable biological properties of chitosan with the good mechanical properties and \n\nprocessability of polyesters (26, 28, 30-33), leading to a chitosan based material with \n\nadjustable properties for tissue engineering applications (30-32).  \n\nThe purpose of the present work is to evaluate the performance of the developed \n\nmicrofiber mesh scaffolds. For that, we assess the cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of human MSCs isolated from bone marrow and seeded onto novel \n\nchitosan/polyester micro fiber mesh scaffolds aimed to be used in bone tissue engineering \n\nfield. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1.  Scaffold processing  \n\nNew chitosan based scaffolds were, developed by a fiber bonding technique. The \n\nprocessing methodology is entirely melt based, thus avoiding the limitations of solvent-based \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n123 \n\nprocessing, and it is described in detail elsewhere (26). Briefly, chitosan was melt blended \n\nwith polybutylene succinate (PBS) (50/50 wt%) in a twin-screw extruder. The extrudate was \n\ngrinded into powder and further processed into microfibers, using a microextruder. The \n\ndiameter of the fibers was controlled by the diameter of the die. After that, Ch-PBS fibers \n\nwere cut and submitted to hot compression. This last step (15) consisted in applying \n\ntemperature and pressure to obtain a fiber mesh scaffold with inherent porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity. The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide and used for cell culture \n\nstudies.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Scaffolds characterization \n\nChitosan-based fiber mesh scaffolds were analysed using a high-resolution micro-\n\ncomputed tomography Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Five scaffolds \n\nwere scanned in high resolution mode using a pixel size of 8.24 ?m and integration time of \n\n2.0 ms. The X-ray source was set at 80 keV of energy and 124 ?A of current. For all the \n\nscanned specimens representative data sets of 150 slices were transformed into binary \n\nusing a dynamic threshold of 60-255 (grey values) to distinguish polymer material from pore \n\nvoids. This data was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). The \n\nmorphometric analysis included porosity, scaffolds interconnectivity and mean pore size \n\nquantification. Three dimensional (3D) virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of \n\nthe scaffolds were also created, visualized and registered using the image processing \n\nsoftware (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan).  \n\nThe mechanical properties of the scaffolds were tested on compression tests carried \n\nout in a universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505, Universal Machine). A crosshead \n\nspeed of 5 mm/min was used and the compression modulus was determined from the most \n\nlinear region of the stress-strain curve and averaged from the results obtained with five \n\nspecimens.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Cell culture studies \n\n2.3.1. In vitro cytotoxicity tests \n\n A rat lung fibroblast cell line (L929), acquired from the european collection of cell \n\ncultures (ECACC), was used for the initial standard cytotoxicity assays. Tests were carried \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n \n\n124 \n\nout following the international standard ISO 10993. The procedure and methods are \n\ndescribed elsewhere (27).  \n\n \n\n2.3.2. hBMSCs seeding and culture onto the scaffolds \n\nPrimary cultures of hBMSCs were used. The cells were characterized by flow \n\ncytometry for MSCs markers (CD31, CD34, CD45-negative and CD13, CD29, CD73, CD90, \n\nCD105, CD166-positive cells) and differentiation studies into osteogenic, chondrogenic and \n\nadipogenic lineage (34). The cells were grown in a culture medium consisting of alpha \n\nmedium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Germany), 5 mM L-\n\nglutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFgF) (PeproTech, \n\nUSA) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).  When an adequate \n\ncell number was obtained, cells at passage 2 were detached with trypsin/EDTA. Cells were \n\nseeded at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold under static conditions, by means of a cell \n\nsuspension. After 24 hours of attachment, constructs were placed in new 24-well plates and \n\n1 ml of osteogenic medium was added to each well. The osteogenic culture medium \n\nconsisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone 10-8 M (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \n\nascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and \u00df-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. \n\nLouis, MO). The constructs were cultured for periods of up to 7, 14 and 21 days in a \n\nhumidified atmosphere at 37\u00baC, containing 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every \n\n2 to 3 days until the end of the experiment. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Cellular viability assay - MTS test \n\nCell viability was assessed after 3 hours, 7, 14 and 21 days, using the MTS test. The \n\nconstructs (n=3) were rinsed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \n\nand immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent in \n\na 5:1 ratio and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. \n\nAfter this, 200 \u00b5l (n=3) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) was \n\nmeasured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n125 \n\n2.3.4. Cell adhesion and cell viability stained with calcein-AM using confocal laser \n\nmicroscopy  \n\nCells were incubated with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). Inside the \n\ncells, calcein-AM is hydrolyzed by endogenous esterases into the highly negatively charged \n\ngreen fluorescent calcein, which is retained inside the cytoplasm. The constructs were \n\nsectioned and cell adhesion, proliferation and viability were observed in the inner regions of \n\nthe scaffolds using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. \n\n \n\n2.3.5. Cell adhesion and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nCell adhesion, morphology, and spatial distribution were observed by SEM. The \n\nconstructs were washed in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde. After that, the constructs were dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol \n\n(30, 50, 70, 90, 100%) for 15 minutes, twice. Then, the samples were immersed in \n\nhexamethyldisilazane (35) (HDMS; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, USA), and \n\nlet to air dry for 2 h. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated with gold (JEOL JFC-\n\n1100) and analyzed using a Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscope. \n\n \n\n2.3.6. Cell proliferation by DNA quantification \n\nhBMSCs proliferation on the Ch-PBS scaffolds was determined using a fluorimetric \n\ndsDNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). Samples collected \n\nat days 7, 14 and 21, were washed twice with a sterile phosphate buffered saline solution \n\nand transferred into 1.5 ml microtubes containing 1ml of ultra-pure water. Constructs were \n\ncryopreserved at -80\u00baC for further analysis. Prior to DNA quantification, samples were \n\nthawed and sonicated for 15 min. Standards were prepared with concentrations ranging \n\nbetween 0 and 2 mg/ml. Per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 \u00b5l of \n\nsample (n=3) or standard, 71.3 \u00b5l of PicoGreen solution, and 100 \u00b5l of Tris\u2013EDTA buffer. The \n\nplate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and fluorescence was measured using an \n\nexcitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n \n\n126 \n\n2.3.7. Alkaline phosphatase quantification \n\n Samples were collected as previously described. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity \n\nof the scaffolds/cells constructs (n=3) was measured by the specific conversion of p-\n\nnitrophenyl phosphate (pNpp) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The \n\nconstructs were thawed at room temperature and sonicated for 15 min. The enzymatic \n\nreaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml of substrate buffer containing \n\n1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNpp. The solution was further incubated at \n\n37\u00baC for 1 hour and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a solution containing 2 M \n\nNaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard \n\ncurve was made using pNp values ranging from 0 to 20 ?mol/ml. The results were \n\nnormalized by DNA values and expressed in ?mol of pNp produced/?g ds DNA. A detailed \n\ndescription of the assay can be found elsewhere (36). \n\n \n\n2.3.8. Mineralization content by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) \n\n The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM. The samples (n=3) \n\nwere sputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100) with the purpose of analyzing the \n\npresence of Ca and P elements at the surface by EDS with a Leica Cambridge S360 \n\nscanning electron microscope. Sputter coating with carbon avoids overlapping of signals of \n\nthe coating with the elements being analyzed. \n\n \n\n2.3.9. Mineralization crystallinity by fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\n The constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde. The samples were pressed into pellets with potassium bromide (KBr; Riedel-\n\nde Haen, Germany). The IR spectrum was measured using a FTIR Spectrometer (model \n\nIRPrestige-21, Shimadzu; Germany) in the wavelength range of 4000\u2013400 cm?1. \n\n \n\n2.3.10. Osteogenic differentiation by reverse transcriptase PCR \n\n Total RNA was isolated from cells with Trizol (Sigma, St Louis, USA), according to the \n\nmanufacturer protocol. A NanoDrop Microspectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n127 \n\nSpectrophotometer, Alfagene, USA) was used to measure the total RNA amounts (ng/\u00b5l). \n\nAliquots of the total RNA (100 ng/?l) were transcripted into cDNA and amplified in each PCR \n\nin one step RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) and gene specific primers were added. \n\nEach cDNA sample was run in triplicate for every PCR. Amplification was performed using a \n\nMastercycler gradient (MyCycler\u2122, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). The first reverse transcription \n\nstep at 42\u00baC for 30 min was followed by a step of denaturation at 95\u00baC during 5 min. After \n\nthis, 35 cycles of PCR were performed, each consisting of a denaturation stage at 95\u00baC for 1 \n\nmin, annealing at a given temperature accordingly with the specific primer used, and then an \n\nextension stage at 72\u00baC for 2 min. In all cases, a final extension at 72\u00baC for 5 min was \n\nperformed before storing the samples at 4\u00baC. Specific primers used were: for human Runx2, \n\nosteocalcin, type 1 collagen, BSP and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-\n\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).\u00a0 PCR products were separated by 1% agarose (Biorad, \n\nUSA) at least twice. The separated DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide \n\n(Sigma, St Louis, MO) staining and observed with an Eagleye software (Alpha Innotech, \n\nUSA) using excitation at 514 nm and emission at 610 nm.  \n\n \n\n2.3.11. Statistical analysis \n\n Results of MTS and ALP are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation with n=3 for \n\neach group. Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student?s t-test \n\nmultiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS  \n\n3.1. Scaffolds characterization \n\nPorous chitosan based fiber mesh scaffolds used in this study were produced with a \n\nblend of 50% chitosan and 50% of poly(butylene succinate). The scaffolds were prepared \n\nusing melt extrusion, followed by hot compression (fiber bonding).  Scaffolds were cut into \n\ncylinders of approximately 6.5 mm diameter and thickness of 1.5 mm. Figure 1 shows the top \n\nsurface of the novel chitosan based fiber mesh scaffold produced by the described melt \n\nbased process. Scaffolds show a large porosity and inherent interconnectivity, as well as an \n\nirregular distribution of the fiber orientation as intended. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Three-dimensional (3D) images obtained by \u00b5-CT reconstruction model (a) and \n\nSEM photomicrograph of Ch-PBS (50% wt) fiber mesh scaffold (b).  \n\n \n\nThe \u00b5CT technology allows obtaining series of X-ray slice images covering a \n\nrepresentative volume region of the porous scaffold. The solid volume representation and the \n\nquantitative data is obtained following image processing using specific software and the X-\n\nrays micrographs obtained in each slice. This technique was used to obtain 3D images of the \n\nnovel chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds (Figure 1a) and to quantitatively determine the average \n\nporosity (44.8% \u00b1 2.1) and the interconnectivity of 89.6% \u00b1 1.9. Compression mechanical \n\ntests have shown that scaffolds have a compression modulus of 32.6 \u00b1 12.8 MPa, which is \n\nwithin the range of interest for bone applications (37).  \n\nThe fibers used to produce these scaffolds have an average diameter of 450 \u00b5m and \n\nas can be seen in Figure 1b, evidence an interesting surface roughness that may contribute \n\nto enhance the cell adhesion by increasing the surface area. Moreover, detailed observations \n\nusing \u00b5CT equipment show that microfibers in addition to the surface roughness also \n\npossess some microporosity at the surface that further enhances the surface area (Figure \n\n1a).  \n\n \n\n3.2. In vitro cytotoxicity tests \n\n In the MTS test (data not shown), L929 fibroblasts metabolized MTS into brown \n\nformazan product after incubation with the scaffold?s extract. This fact evidences that the \n\ncells have metabolic activities (around 80%) similar to those obtained by cells grown in \n\nDMEM (negative control). Moreover, they were able to incorporate and metabolize MTS, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM \n\nAfter 1 week, hBMSCs cultured under osteogenic conditions, were able to adhere to \n\nthe fibrous surface and inner pores of the scaffolds and to proliferate during the subsequent \n\nperiods in culture (Figures 4A, 4D and 4G). The production of ECM can be analyzed in more \n\ndepth at higher magnifications (Figures 4C, 4F and 4I). Furthermore, it is observed that the \n\ncells were able to create \u201cbridges\u201d between neighboring fibers, but without occluding the \n\npores (Figures 4B and 4E). Cells were also capable of colonizing the inner regions of the \n\nscaffolds, keeping the viability on those inner pores (Figures 4J, 4K and 4L).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Alkaline phosphatase quantification \n\nThe expression of ALP is typically used as an early marker of the osteogenic \n\nphenotype. The ALP expression shows the typical pattern of expression (Figure 5), \n\nincreasing until the second week, where it reached its maximum. This observation reflects \n\nthe early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. After this period, ALP activity \n\ndecreased, probably due to the onset of the mineralization process (36). This observation is a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Mineralization content of ECM by EDS and FTIR analysis \n\nEDS analysis of the surface of constructs detected the presence of Ca and P \n\nelements (Figure 6 A). Acellular scaffolds (control) do not show any presence of those two \n\nelements during the same period of immersion in osteogenic inducing culture medium. These \n\nresults clearly indicate the formation of mineralized ECM at the surface of cell seeded \n\nscaffolds. These results were further confirmed by FTIR analysis (Figure 6C), showing the \n\npresence of phosphate and carbonate groups, which are typical for carbonated apatite (38). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs upon chitosan based scaffolds \n\nTo further analyze the differentiation towards the osteogenic phenotype, the RNA of \n\nthe cell cultured in the scaffolds is analysed by reverse transcriptase PCR (Figure7).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Its expression was detected at all time points, \n\nbeing more pronounced at the third week of culture. The gene expression patterns of the \n\nvarious extracellular proteins, including osteocalcin, type 1 collagen and BSP, was detected \n\nat all time points and in increased levels at the latest time point. This indicates a successful \n\ndifferentiation into the osteogenic phenotype. \n\n \n\n4. DISCUSSION \n\nThe demand for new therapies for diseases affecting musculoskeletal tissues is \n\ncontinuously increasing, especially considering the high number of patients suffering from \n\nskeletal degenerative diseases. Bone tissue engineering has been proposing solutions to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n \n\n134 \n\naddress those clinical problems. The strategy could combine cells with a 3D scaffold and \n\ngrowth factors, seeking to achieve the regeneration of bone tissue. \n\nNatural-based polymers such as chitosan, a polymer produced by partial \n\ndeacetylation of chitin, have been proposed as having potential for tissue engineering \n\napplications. Chitosan is characterized by its good biocompatibility, low immunogeneicity, \n\nnon-cytotoxicity and wound healing capability. These properties make chitosan a strong \n\ncandidate material for bone tissue engineering applications. Due to its limited mechanical \n\nproperties and process ability, scaffolds produced only with chitosan are more difficult to \n\noptimize for hard tissue applications. An alternative methodology to overcome those \n\nlimitations consists in blending chitosan with synthetic and biodegradable aliphatic polyesters \n\n(26, 33). Thermoplastic biodegradable polymers have already shown great potential in the \n\nclinic as implantable biomaterials due to their reported non-cytotoxicity and biodegradability. \n\nTheir degradation products are also non-cytotoxic, although they lack the cell recognition \n\naffinity typically provided by natural polymers. Thus by blending chitosan with synthetic \n\npolyesters it is possible to obtain a good balance between biological affinity (30-32) and \n\nprocessability, not compromising the biodegradability. \n\nThe developed fibrous scaffolds showed a significant interconnectivity (Figure 1), \n\nwhich is known to be a critical condition for successful cell colonization and viability. Extracts \n\nfrom the developed scaffolds are non-cytotoxic in contact with L929 cells (data not presented \n\nherein).  \n\nHuman MSCs showed high metabolic levels when adhered onto the scaffolds both by \n\nthe reduction of the MTS substrate (Figure 2) and also by the calcein-am staining (Figure 3).  \n\nSEM micrographs (Figure 4) show that hBMSCs adhered at the surface of the \n\nscaffolds and were able to \u201cbridge\u201d between fibers without occluding the pores (Figure 4C). \n\nThe proliferation of hBMSCs and the production of ECM showed increased levels over time \n\n(Figures 4A, 4D and 4G). SEM observations and cell viability results can help to establish a \n\ntime dependent cell proliferation patterns as showing the presence of higher number of cells \n\nat late time periods. It was also observed that cells proliferated and colonized the inner \n\nregions (Figures 4J, 4K and 4L) of the scaffolds, which demonstrate that porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity exhibited by the scaffolds are adequate for cell infiltration and ingrowth. \n\nALP activity measurements (Figure 5) showed a maximum at the second week of \n\nculture, reflecting the early osteogenic differentiation stage of hMSCs (36). After this period, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n\n135 \n\nALP activity decreased due to the onset of the mineralization process, which is a typical \n\npositive indication.  \n\nhBMSCs were able to produce mineralized ECM confirmed by the presence of Ca \n\nand P elements (Figure 6a). Furthermore, the existence of characteristic peaks of carbonate \n\nand phosphate groups in FTIR spectra (Figure 6C) indicates the presence of carbonated \n\napatite at the surface of constructs. \n\nThe differentiation of the hBMSCs towards the osteogenic lineage was ultimately \n\ndemonstrated by the expression of genes that are usually associated with the mineralization \n\nduring osteogenesis, such as the transcription factor Runx2, and the matrix proteins \n\nosteocalcin, type 1 collagen and BSP (Figure 7). Runx2 is essential for the differentiation of \n\nMSCs into mature osteoblasts in the skeletal development of numerous mammalian \n\norganisms (39, 40). Osteocalcin, one of the few osteogenic specific genes, is a bone matrix \n\nprotein and it is known to play an important role in the differentiation of osteoblast progenitor \n\ncells, with significant up-regulation observed both in matrix synthesis and in the \n\nmineralization process (39). BSP is secreted, bind cell surface integrin receptors, and \n\nregulate mineralization and type I collagen represents the majority of the organic part of bone \n\nmatrix (41).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications \n \n\n136 \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n Chitosan\u2013poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds were successfully produced \n\nby a melt based routine, avoiding the use of solvents. The scaffolds presented a high degree \n\nof interconnectivity (89,6% \u00b1 1.9) and adequate mechanical properties (32.6 \u00b1 12.8 MPa) for \n\nbone tissue engineering applications. \n\n It was demonstrated that chitosan-PBS scaffolds are cytocompatible, both with L929 \n\ncells and hBMSCs. The scaffolds support hBMSCs adhesion and proliferation under \n\nosteogenic inducing conditions. The cells presented high levels of viability, demonstrating \n\nthat besides the remarkable colonization of the scaffold structure, the cells were \n\nmetabolically active.  \n\n ALP expression a mineralized ECM is detected by the presence of Ca and P \n\nelements in EDS spectra, and also confirmed by FTIR. The expression of osteogenic related \n\ngenes (Runx2, osteocalcin, type 1 collagen and bone sialoprotein) show successful \n\ndifferentiation of the cells in the scaffolds towards an osteogenic phenotype. \n\n Due to the extremely well balanced combination of properties and excellent biological \n\nperformance, it is strongly believed that the scaffolds herein proposed in combination with \n\nhuman adult mesenchymal stem cells will provide new therapies for the development of \n\ntissue engineering solutions for bone regeneration. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nAna Costa-Pinto was supported by a grant (SFRH/24735/2005) from the Portuguese \n\nFoundation for Science and Technology \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia\u201d (FCT). \n\nThis work was partially supported by the EU Integrated Project GENOSTEM (Adult \n\nMesenchymal Stem Cells Engineering for connective tissue disorders: from the bench to the \n\nbedside, LSHB-CT-2003-5033161), and the European Network of Excellence \n\nEXPERTISSUES (NMP3-CT-2004-500283).

Furthermore, the evaluation of a \n\nhost response to the implantation of the biomaterials must be performed to understand the \n\nextent of the inflammatory reaction. \n\n Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds, in previous studies evidenced \n\nenhanced biological performance, not only in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation, but \n\nalso as supporting the osteogenic differentiation of mouse and human MSCs. The following \n\nstep consisted on the study of the degradation process in vitro using relevant enzymes, \n\nlipase and lysozyme, responsible for the degradation of the poly(butylene succinate) and \n\nchitosan, respectively. Moreover, subcutaneous implantation of the scaffolds was performed \n\nto assess the tissue response. Histology and immunoshistochemistry were used to visualize \n\nthe type of inflammatory cells present in the surrounding tissue, as well as within the \n\nscaffold.. \n\n In the presence of lipase, or with lysozyme, water uptake of the scaffolds increased. \n\nThis phenomenon is probably due to the degradation of scaffolds by the enzymes. Weight \n\nloss results and scanning electron micsoscopy (SEM) analysis evidenced that lysozyme \n\ncombined with lipase have a notable effect on the degradation of the scaffolds in vitro. \n\n In vivo implantation showed a normal inflammatory response with the typical \n\npresence of neutrophils in a first stage and macrophages, lymphocytes and giant cells in a \n\nlater stage. Vascularization was observed, increasing with time, by the presence of blood \n\nvessels in the surrounding tissue and within the implant. Moreover, collagen deposition, \n\nvizualized by Masson trichrome stain, increased over time inside of the implant. During the \n\nentire in vivo experiment the scaffolds maintained the structural integrity, although after 12 \n\nweeks it was possible to observe cell colonization inside the fibrous structure. In vitro results \n\nshowed a faster and greater degradation compared to those observed in vivo. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 144\u00a0\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n Many biodegradable polymers have been proposed to produce scaffolds in Tissue \nEngineering field. These structures sustain the extracellular matrix (ECM) production by cells \n\nand at the same time, it is expected to degrade gradually to allow the surrounding tissue to \n\nreplace the supporting function of the scaffold (1).  \n\n Biodegradable polymers are able to act as a a temporary substrate that will degrade \n\nover time, in a controlled way into products, which will be eliminated by regular metabolic \n\npathways in the body (biodegradation) (2). Furthermore, the biological performance of some \n\nbiomaterials depends on their degradation behavior, since this process influences cell \n\nperformance and inflammatory response. Therefore, it is crucial to study the degradation \n\nproperties of the scaffold for a long term success of the tissue engineered construct (3). \n\n In the last years, natural biodegradable polymers have been used to produce \n\nscaffolds for tissue engineering. Due to their resemblance with the ECM, natural polymers \n\nmay avoid the stimulation of chronic inflammation or toxicity, generally found out for synthetic \n\npolymers (4). Chitosan, the partially deacetylated product of chitin, has emerged as one of \n\nthe favorites, mainly because of the similarity to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), native \n\ncomponents of ECM (5). Additionally, the cationic nature of chitosan allows electrostatic \n\ninteractions with anionic GAGs and proteoglycans (6). \n\n In our group, we have been working with chitosan based scaffolds (7-15). One of the \n\nmost promising biomaterials is the chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) processed into \n\nscaffolds by melt based technology (16-18). These scaffolds combine the biological \n\nproperties of chitosan and the mechanical properties of aliphatic polyesters (17, 18). In vitro \n\nstudies performed with different cell types showed a remarkable cell colonization of these \n\nscaffolds (10, 13, 14, 19). Chitosan has been proposed as a biomaterial for biomedical \n\napplications mainly due to its biocompatibility (20). Furthermore, it has been described as a \n\npotent wound healing accelerator (21-26), as well as to modulate the immune system by \n\nactivating macrophages (27) to produce cytokines (28) and to inhibit infection (29).  \n\n Poly(butylene succinate) is a biodegradable synthetic polymer with good \n\nprocessability when compared to poly(lactic acid) or poly(glycolic acid) (30). Moreover, it \n\nshows good mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering, comparable to those of poly-\n\ncaprolactone (31). The degradation profile of poly(butylene succinate) in the environment has \n\nbeen widely studied (32-34). Succinic acid is the main degradation product, which is an \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 145\u00a0\n\nintermediate of the tricarboxilic acid cycle, that ultimately degrades into carbon dioxide and \n\nwater (32, 34).  \n\n Some biomaterials are degraded by hydrolysis, a non-enzymatic degradation, whose \n\nmaterials are mainly decomposed by contact with water or serum, being this process non \n\nspecifically regulated (35). Biodegradation of polymeric biomaterials requires cleavage of \n\nhydrolytically and/or enzymatically sensitive bonds in the polymer, leading to polymer erosion \n\n(36). Degradation products should be non-toxic and free of immunogenicity. The resulting \n\nproducts should be small enough to dissolve in the body fluids and, after transportation via \n\nlymphatic system, the kidneys should be able to excrete them from the body (37). The \n\ndegradation behavior of polymers can be tested previously in vitro, in order to predict their \n\nbehavior when implanted in vivo. Usually, biomaterials are incubated in phosphate buffered \n\nsolution, with or without enzymes, at 37\u00baC, under static and/or dynamic conditions to better \n\nsimulate the in vivo conditions. It is common that degradation studies are performed in \n\nparallel with biocompatibility tests, both in vitro and in vivo. This close relation is due to the \n\nfact that the degradation of a biomaterial implanted in a host is influenced by the presence \n\nand recruitment of inflammatory cells and, consequently, by the production of inflammatory \n\nmediators.  \n\n In vivo, chitosan was shown to be degraded mainly by lysozyme (38-40). The \n\ndegradation kinetics of chitosan is inversely related to the degree of deacetylation (39, 41), \n\nsince this enzyme targets the acetylated residues of chitosan polymer (38, 40). Human \n\nlysozyme is found in several body fluids, including serum (42, 43), tears (42, 43), saliva (42, \n\n43) and other fluids, like those surrounding cartilage (44). It is also important to highlight the \n\nfact that during inflammation process, neutrophils and macrophages cells will release \n\nenzymes, namely lysozyme and reactive oxygen species (45). On the other hand, PBS is an \n\naliphatic polyester and these polymers are known to be degraded by lipases (46). This \n\nenzyme is water soluble, hydrolyzing ester bonds of triglycerides, phospholipids and \n\ncholesteryl esters (47, 48). Human lipases include pre-duodenal lingual, gastric, extra-\n\nduodenal pancreatic, hepatic, lipoprotein and endothelial lipases (49). Serum lipase is mainly \n\nderived from pancreatic cells, but tissues such as digestive track, adipose tissue, lungs and \n\nleucocytes also contain lipase (50, 51). \n\n One of the most important requisites for clinical application of a biomaterial is its \n\nbiocompatibility, that is defined as the ability of a material to perform, with an appropriate \n\nhost response, in a specific application (52). The implantation of a biomaterial device sets off \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 146\u00a0\n\na cascade of events that starts with an acute inflammatory response that may lead to a \n\nchronic inflammatory response. Polymorphonucleated cells (PMNs), macrophages and new \n\nblood vessels are present and granulation tissue can be developed, with subsequent foreign \n\nbody reaction and fibrous capsule development (53). The inflammation process serves to \n\ncontain, neutralize or dilute the injurious agent or process. Thus, the intensity and the \n\nduration of the inflammatory reaction may characterize the biocompatibility of a biomaterial \n\n(54). In the case of biodegradable polymers, the intensity of these responses may be \n\nmodulated by the biodegradation process that can cause changes in shape, size, surface \n\nroughness, porosity and release of degradation products (54). Generally, the local reaction of \n\nan implant is studied after a 3 months implantation period, as described in the ISO standard \n\n10993-6 (55). This time frame usually reflects a steady state, where the local \n\nacceptance/rejection can be evaluated.  \n\n In this work we studied the biodegradation process, as well as the biocompatibility of \n\nchitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds. The tests in vitro involved enzymes \n\nresponsible for the degradation of chitosan and PBS, lysozyme and/or lipase, respectively. \n\nThe in vitro degradation studies were carried out using the enzymes in concentrations similar \n\nto those present in the human blood serum. In vivo studies were performed with the main \n\naims of studying the biodegradation and the biocompatibility of these scaffolds, using a \n\nsubcutaneous model in Wistar rats during 3 months of implantation. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Scaffolds production \n\n The processing methodology is described in previous works from our group (19). \n\nBriefly, chitosan was melt blended with polybutylene succinate by extrusion (50% wt). The \n\nresulting extrudate was grinded into powder and processed into microfibers also by \n\nextrusion. The fibers were cut and submitted to hot compression. In this study the scaffolds \n\ndimensions were 6.5 mm diameter and 1 mm. The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide \n\nto be further used in subsequent tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 147\u00a0\n\n2.2. In vitro degradation studies \n\n Degradation studies were performed in triplicate by incubating the scaffolds in \n\nphosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) (control), with lipase from aspergillus oryzal \n\n(Fluka) (110 U/L) and/or lysozyme chicken egg white (Sigma) (13 mg/L). The concentrations \n\nused were similar those found in human blood serum, at 37\u00baC in dynamic conditions (60 rpm) \n\nfor 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. At the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed \n\nand immediately weighed to determine the water uptake and dried for later calculation of the \n\nweight loss.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Water uptake and weight loss measurements \n\n All samples were weighed before incubation in phosphate buffered saline or \nenzymatic solutions (initial weight). After 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, three samples of each \n\ncondition were removed and immediately weighed for determination of water uptake \n\n(Equation 1), washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried for later calculation of weight \n\nloss (Equation 2),  \n\n \n\nWater uptake (%) = [(ww \u2013 wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) \n\n \n\nWeight loss (%) = [wi \u2013 wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) \n\n \n\nwhere wi is the initial weight,  ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Analysis of sample morphology by scanning electron microscopy \n\n The samples morphology, before and after degradation with the different solutions \n\nwas analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (NanoSEM, FEI company, USA). \n\n \n\n2.3. In vivo degradation studies \n\n One day before subcutaneous implantation surgery the implants were immersed in \n\nphosphate buffered saline solution under sterile conditions. Twelve adult male Wistar Han \n\nrats (41-44 days old at the beginning of the experiment), Specified Pathogen Free, were \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 148\u00a0\n\npurchased from Charles River Laboratories, France. The animals were kept one week in a \n\nquarantine room and transferred to a conventional maintenance room of the experimental \n\nunit of the animal facility, where they were housed for the all period of the experiment. \n\n For the present study, 12 animals were used for subcutaneous implantation of \n\nacellular scaffolds. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, samples were retrieved for further analysis. \n\nAnimals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution of 75//0.5 mg/kg body \n\nweight ketamine/metedomidine (Imalgene\u00ae/Dorbenvet\u00ae). After confirming depth of \n\nanesthesia by pedal reflex, the dorsum of the animals was shaved and they were placed in \n\nventral position. The incision site at the dorsal skin was disinfected with clorohexidine and 2 \n\nmedial longitudinal incisions were performed. Subcutaneous pockets were created and 4 \n\nscaffolds were placed in each animal, away from the suture site (incision) to avoid \n\ninflammation of the wound. The incisions were closed with a 4.0 silk suture (Look, Harvard, \n\nUSA), which was removed 10 days after surgery in the animals with longer implantation \n\nperiods. The anesthesia was then reverted with a subcutaneous injection of 0.25 mg/kg \n\nAtipamezol (Antisedan\u00ae). Once animals become active, they were placed in their home \n\ncages and water and food were supplied ad libitum. Each animal received a subcutaneous \n\ninjection of 1mg/kg analgesic Butorphanol (Torbugesic\u00ae) administered immediately after \n\nsurgery and 24h later, to avoid post-operative pain. At each time point, animals were \n\neuthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium penthobarbital, at a lethal dose, and the \n\nrespective implants retrieved.  \n\nAll procedures were conducted in accordance with European regulations for animal \n\nlaboratory testing (European Union Directive 86/609/EEC).  \n\n \n\n2.4. Histological evaluation \n\n2.4.1. Implants processing and H&amp;E staining \n\n The implants were collected with the surrounding tissues and processed for histology. \n\nThe retrieved implants together with the surrounding tissue were fixed in 10% neutral \n\nbuffered formalin. The specimens were cut to obtain 3 \u00b5m thickness longitudinal and \n\ntransverse sections to analyse the kinetics of degradation of the scaffolds. Sections were \n\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to evaluate the in vivo degradation and cellular \n\ninfiltration throughout the implants.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

Masson?s trichrome staining \n\n Masson?s trichrome stain was used to evaluate the amount and the distribution of \n\nmature collagen. This stain is useful to differentiate collagen fibers from other fibers, \n\nparticularly smooth muscle and elastin. Masson trichrome stains collagen green, nuclei black \n\nand cytoplasm red.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Immunohistochemistry \n\n Immunostaining for ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) antibody was performed to \n\nassess the vascularization degree. Antigen retrieval was heat induced in a water bath at \n\n96\u00baC for 20 min, with incubation of the slides in citrate buffer (pH=6). The slides were washed \n\nwith phosphate buffer saline and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen \n\nperoxide (H2O2) in methanol, at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. R.T.U. Vectastain\u00ae \n\nUniversal Elite ABC Kit (Vector, VCPK-7200) was used for antibody incubation, according to \n\nthe instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, sections were incubated with primary antibody \n\n(Abcam, ab5694) overnight at 4\u00baC, in a humidified atmosphere. After washing with \n\nphosphate bufferes saline, antibody detection was revealed by using the Peroxidase \n\nSubstrate Kit DAB (Vector, VCSK-4100). Slides were washed in water for 5 minutes and then \n\ncounterstained with Harris? haematoxylin for nuclear contrast. All images were obtained using \n\nan Olympus BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera (Olympus \n\nDP70).  \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Weight loss and water uptake \n\n In this study, scaffolds based on chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) were prepared by \nmelt spinning and fiber bonding (18, 19). The main aim of the in vitro degradation studies \n\nwas to simulate physiological conditions using enzymes present in human serum, which are \n\nresponsible for the degradation of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds. \n\n Degradation studies using lysozyme and/or lipase were performed using dynamic (60 \n\nrpm). No differences were observed in the pH of the different degradation solutions after \n\neach incubation time.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 150\u00a0\n\n The ability of a material to absorb water and its water permeability are important \n\nparameters to be studied, since it will influence the absorption of body fluids and the transfer \n\nof cell nutrients and metabolites throughout the materials. The water uptake data (Figure 1) \n\nshows that scaffolds immersed in phosphate buffered saline solution (control) in dynamic \n\nconditions without changing the solutions, have a hydration degree of approximately 40%. \n\nThose scaffolds were blends of chitosan (50% wt), an extremely hydrophilic material and \n\npoly(butylene succinate), known to be more hydrophobic than chitosan. When only lysozyme \n\nwas present, the degradation of the scaffolds was quite similar to the control (Figure 1). \n\nHowever, in the presence of lipase or lipase with lysozyme, the water uptake of the materials \n\nhad a remarkable increase (Figure 1). This behaviour might be due to degradation of the \n\nscaffolds in the presence of these enzymes.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1. Water uptake of the scaffolds as a function of immersion time in PBS with \nlysozyme (13 mg/L), lipase (110 U/L) and both lipase and lysozyme. PBS alone was used as \n\na control (pH 7.4, T=37\u00baC), in dynamic conditions. \n\n \n\n When analyzing the weight loss profile using lysozyme or lipase, few differences were \n\nobserved (Figure 2). The degradation of chitosan in the human body has been reported to be \n\nmediated by lysozyme (39, 40). The scaffolds immersed in phosphate buffered saline \n\nsupplemented with lysozyme presented the highest weight loss (5%) in the first week, as \n\ncompared with the other conditions. The weight loss remained constant until the end of the \n\nexperiment (Figure 2). It was clear that degradation of the scaffolds in the presence of \n\nlysozyme it was not pronounced. This result might be explained by the degree of \n\ndeacetylation of chitosan used in this study. This chitosan has 85% deacetilation degree and \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n120 \n\n0 1 3 6 12 \n\nW\nat\n\ner\n u\n\npt\nak\n\ne \n(%\n\n) \n\nTime (weeks) \n\ncontrol Lysozyme Lipase Lipase and lysozyme \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 151\u00a0\n\nit is well documented in the literature that the degree of deacetylation is inversely related to \n\nthe degradation rate (38, 41, 43). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Weight loss of the scaffolds as a function of immersion time in PBS with lysozyme \n(13 mg/L), lipase (110 U/L), and both lipase and lysozyme. PBS alone was used as a control \n\n(pH 7.4, T=37\u00baC), in dynamic conditions. \n\n \n\n Lipase is an enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of ester bonds in polyesters (46, \n\n56). In the presence of lipase the values of weight loss were higher than those obtained in \n\nthe presence of lysozyme, increasing as a function of immersion time (Figure 2). \n\nNevertheless, immersion periods up to 12 weeks did not cause the scaffolds to loose their \n\nstructural integrity in the presence of either lysozyme or lipase.  \n\n In order to investigate the effect of an enzyme cocktail containing lipase and \n\nlysozyme, the scaffolds were also incubated with both enzymes. The highest weight loss was \n\nobserved in the presence of lipase and lysozyme together (Figure 2). These results are in \n\nagreement with previous studies using different enzymatic cocktails (57, 58). In contrast with \n\nthe other conditions, lipase and lysozyme together induced the loss of structural integrity of \n\nthe scaffolds after 3 weeks. At the 6th week, all scaffolds lost their structural integrity in the \n\npresence of both enzymes.  \n\n \n\n3.2. Morphology of the scaffolds before and after in vitro degradation  \n\n The morphology of the scaffolds was studied before and after degradation with the \n\ndifferent solutions by SEM (Figure 3).

In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 152\u00a0\n\ndegradation (Figures 3A and 3B). The surface of the fibers showed fractures as a result of \n\ndegradation (Figures 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 3I and 3J). It is possible to observe that the \n\nsamples incubated in phosphate buffered saline, evidence a rougher surface (Figures 3C \n\nand 3D). The scaffolds incubated with lysozyme solution (Figures 3E and 3F) presented \n\ncracks at the surface of the fiber, at the same level than in those incubated in phosphate \n\nbuffered saline. This result may be explained by the fact that the chitosan used has a high \n\nlevel of deacetylation and it is well documented in the literature that for high degrees of \n\ndeacetylation, lysozyme has a minimal effect on the polymer degradation (38). However for \n\nscaffolds incubated with lipase solution (Figures 3G and 3H) more cracks are visible at the \n\nsurface of the fibers, which confirms that lipase, is attacking the polyester phase. The \n\ncombination of both lysozyme and lipase (Figures 3I and 3J), as expected by the water \n\nuptake and weight loss results, evidenced larger cracks at the surface of the fibers. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. SEM micrographs showing the morphology of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) \nscaffolds before degradation (A and B), after 12 weeks in PBS (C and D), plus lysozyme (E \n\nand F), lipase (G and H) and both lysozyme and lipase (I and J). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 153\u00a0\n\n3.3. Biocompatibility assessment by histological analysis \n\n No signs of infection were observed during the study or after surgery. Scaffolds were \nimplanted subcutaneously and explants were retrieved after 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Local \n\ntissue integration, inflammatory response and degradation behavior were assessed by \n\nhistological stains (H&amp;E and Masson\u00b4s thricrome). \n\n The implantation of a biomaterial may result in injury to tissues or organs (53, 59). \n\nThe tissue response to injury depends on various factors, including the extent of the injury, \n\nblood-material interactions, extent or degree of cellular necrosis, provisional matrix formation \n\nand the inflammatory response (54). Materials currently used in clinical applications \n\nconsidered non-immunogenic, non-toxic and chemically inert, elicit frequently acute and \n\npotential chronic inflammatory response (60).  \n\n Chitin and chitosan have been shown to accelerate wound healing and the attainment \n\nof a good healing surface. Histological findings suggest that these substances stimulate \n\nmigration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells and accelerate connective tissue \n\nregeneration and angiogenesis (61). It is also known that chitosan has the ability to attract \n\nneutrophils and activate macrophages (27, 62).  \n\n Histological sections of implanted scaffolds revealed that the porous morphology of \n\nthe scaffolds is maintained after 7 days of implantation (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

Ch \u2013 chitosan, PBS \u2013 poly(butylene \n\nsuccinate). \n\n \n\n A detailed observation of the sections evidenced that the inflammatory infiltrate is \n\nmainly constituted of neutrophils (Figure 4B). Those cells are characterized by multilobulated \n\nnuclei, recruited from blood circulation, reacting to the implantation of chitosan-poly(butylene \n\nsuccinate) scaffolds. These cells are characteristic of the acute inflammatory response, \n\nwhich is the initial process of inflammation process. Acute inflammation has short duration \n\n(hours to days) and is characterized by exudation of fluid and plasma proteins (edema) and \n\nthe emigration of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils. The major role of these cells in acute \n\ninflammatory response is to phagocytose microorganisms and foreign materials. In the case \n\nof biomaterials, neutrophils are not able to phagocytose them because of the size disparity \n\n(Figure 4B).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 155\u00a0\n\n At 3 weeks of implantation, the presence of neutrophils was almost residual. It was \n\nclear the presence of blood vessels within the scaffold structure (Figures 5C and 5D). \n\nFurthermore, smooth muscle actin immunostaining is visible inside the fibers of the scaffold \n\n(Figure 5B), which indicates that connective tissue is growing and vascularization is \n\nincreasing throughout the scaffold (11). At the same time, collagen is being deposited by \n\nfibroblasts (Figure 6B). The appearance of blood vessels and fibrosis is an indication of a \n\nchronic inflammatory response. This type of response emerges when a persistent stimulus is \n\npresent (59). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.

Ch \u2013 chitosan, PBS \u2013 poly(butylene succinate). \n\n \n\n After 6 weeks of implantation (Figures 7A and 7B), it was possible to observe the \n\nevolution of the acute inflammatory response into a chronic response, by the presence of \n\ngranulatomous tissue and giant cells. Chronic inflammatory response is longer than acute \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 156\u00a0\n\nand it is characterized by the presence of mononuclear cells, which includes macrophages, \n\nlymphocytes and plasma cells (63). Implantation of foreign materials elicits the normal foreign \n\nbody reaction (FBR), i.e., foreign body reaction composed of foreign body giant cells and \n\ngranulation tissue development, constituted by macrophages, fibroblasts and capillaries (54). \n\nBiodegradable materials elicit a FBR that, with time will become chronic until final \n\ndegradation. In the case of non-degradable materials, the reaction continues until a capsule \n\nis formed around the implant, isolating it and FBR from the local tissue environment (60). \n\nForeign body giant cells are formed when material particles are too large to be phagocytosed \n\nby macrophages and these cells fuse. In figure 5C it could be observed the phagocytosis of a \n\nchitosan particle by giant cells (dashed arrow). A major organization of the tissue within the \n\nimplant was observed, with marked presence of ?-SMA (Figure 5C) and collagen deposition \n\n(Figure 6C). \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Masson\u00b4s thricrome stained sections of tissues of chitosan-poly(butylene \nsuccinate) mesh scaffolds after (A) 1 week, (B) 3 weeks, (C) 6 weeks and (D) 12 weeks of \n\nimplantation.

In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 157\u00a0\n\n Up to 3 months, implanted scaffolds did not show evident signs of significant \n\ndegradation. Histological findings only presented the ingrowth of cells within each fiber of the \n\nscaffold (Figures 8C and 8D). Giant cells attempted to phagocytose the particles of the \n\nscaffold, with some evidence, as presented in figure 6C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Representative H&amp;E stained histological sections of tissues surrounding chitosan-\n\nbased implants after (A, B) 6 week and (C, D) 12 weeks of subcutaneous implantation in \n\nWistar rats. B and D represent the magnified sections of selected areas (square) of A and B, \n\nrespectively. Black arrows point to new blood vessels. Ch \u2013 chitosan, PBS \u2013 poly(butylene \n\nsuccinate). \n\n \n\n After 12 weeks of implantation (Figures 7C and 7D), all scaffolds maintained its shape \n\nand structure, in contrast with the in vitro results, which after 6 weeks incubated in lipase and \n\nlysozyme, the scaffolds lost their structural integrity (Figure 2). Thus, it is clear that in vitro \n\ndegradation was much faster than in vivo degradation. One fact that must be highlighted is \n\nthat the magnitude of tissue response to a biodegradable material depends upon the site of \n\nimplantation (64). Another issue is the type of the enzymes used, that even at concentrations \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber \nmesh scaffolds \n\n 158\u00a0\n\nsimilar to the ones found in human serum, are not from human origin and its action may be \n\nslightly different. Furthermore, in vitro tests provide a much more hydrated environment than \n\nthe host environment in vivo. It is important to state as well that pH did not change during the \n\nentire in vitro experiment, being this a major factor contributing to medium acidification and \n\naccelerating the degradation effects (autocatalytic effect) (65). Since in vivo the degradation \n\nwas slower it seems that pH also did not change, otherwise the scaffolds would evidence a \n\nhigher degree of degradation.  \n\n \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\n The degradation rate of the scaffolds must be tailored appropriately accordingly with \n\nthe growth rate of the new tissue. It was shown that an enzymatic cocktail with lysozyme and \n\nlipase (in concentrations equivalent at the ones found in human body) had a strong positive \n\neffect on the scaffolds degradation in vitro. After 12 weeks of implantation, scaffolds did not \n\nlose their structural integrity. It should be noted the difference in kinetics of biodegradation in \n\nvitro and in vivo. A fast degradation in vivo is not desirable, since the degradation should be \n\ncompatible with the rate of tissue formation and bone defects may require some months to \n\nheal. \n\n The implanted scaffolds displayed a normal and mild tissue response, with the \n\ndevelopment of chronic inflammatory response and foreign body reaction.  \n\n It is therefore worthwhile continuing to investigate the functional performance \n\npotential of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds for bone tissue \n\nengineering and regenerative medicine. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDEGMENTS \n\nAna Costa-Pinto was supported by a grant (SFRH/24735/2005) from the Portuguese \n\nFoundation for Science and Technology \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia\u201d (FCT). \n\nThis work was partially supported by the European Network of Excellence \n\nEXPERTISSUES (NMP3-CT-2004-500283).

Usually, scaffolds are seeded with an adequate cell \n\npopulation allowing its growth and maturation upon implantation in vivo.  \n\n Previous studies obtained by our group evidenced significant growth patterns and \n\nosteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) when \n\nseeded and cultured on melt based porous chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds. Therefore, it is \n\ncrucial to test the in vivo performance of the in vitro 3D constructs.  \n\n In this study, chitosan based scaffolds were seeded and cultured in vitro with \n\nhBMSCs for 3 weeks under osteogenic stimulation conditions and analyzed for cell adhesion, \n\nproliferation and differentiation. Implantation of 2 weeks pre-cultured constructs in osteogenic \n\nculture conditions was performed into critical cranial sized defects in nude mice. The \n\nobjective of this study was to verify the scaffold integration and new bone formation. At 8 \n\nweeks of implantation, scaffolds were harvested and prepared for micro computed \n\ntomography analysis (\u00b5CT). Retrieved implants showed good integration with the \n\nsurrounding tissue and significant bone formation, more evident for the scaffolds cultured and \n\nimplanted with human cells. \n\n Results of this work demonstrated that chitosan based scaffolds, besides supporting \n\nin vitro proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, induced bone formation in \n\nvivo. Thus, it was validated its osteogenic potential in orthotopic location in immunodeficient \n\nmice, evidencing good prospects for its use in bone tissue engineering therapies.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n168 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n Tissue Engineering has emerged in the last 17 years as a new regenerative approach \nfor the treatment of a variety of tissues, including bone. The concept is based on the \n\ndevelopment of strategies aimed at obtaining tissue and organ equivalents, that can replace \n\nor restore the natural features and physiological functions of natural tissues in vivo (1). One \n\nof the fundamental principles relies on the need of a specific cell population in combination \n\nwith a 3D structure, in order to promote, in volume, tissue regeneration (2) \n\n The ideal cell population is considered to be autologous undifferentiated stem cells \n\nthat can be isolated from adult sources. Although embryonic stem cells display an enormous \n\npotential, they raise ethical and moral issues, mainly because of the removal and destruction \n\nof human embryos (3). In this context, adult stem cells present an alternative option, being \n\nisolated from several sources, such as bone marrow (4), brain, liver, skin, skeletal muscle, \n\nintestine, pancreas, peripheral blood, dental pulp (3), adipose tissue (5) or fetal tissues such \n\nas umbilical cord (6) or amniotic fluid. Stem cells are defined as cells that have clonogenic \n\nand self-renewing capabilities and that differentiate into multiple cell lineages (7). \n\n Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be combined with appropriate carriers \u2013 \n\nscaffolds \u2013 where a cell population will be grown and further implanted in vivo. Scaffolds \n\nused for tissue engineering purposes mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the \n\nregenerating bone environment. Selection of the material for scaffold production in bone \n\nrelated applications is a very important step towards the creation of a tissue-engineered \n\nconstruct (8). \n\n In the last years, natural polymers emerged as an alternative to synthetic polymers, \n\nmainly due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Most of the synthetic biomaterials \n\nare effective in supporting bone regeneration, either alone or in conjunction with growth \n\nfactors, although they display limitations. Ideally this structure should be biodegradable, \n\nallowing cells to adhere and proliferate, leading to the formation of ECM (9). Different natural \n\nbased polymers have been proposed for this demanding application, such as starch (10, 11) \n\nand chitosan (12-15). Chitosan has shown an excellent combination of properties, including \n\nnon-antigenicity and non-cytotoxicity, making this biomaterial quite attractive for bone tissue \n\nengineering applications (16, 17).  \n\n We have developed a set of biomaterials using the thermal based processing of \n\nthermoplastic polymers, by blending chitosan (Ch) with different aliphatic polyesters such as, \n\npoly-(?-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene terephthalate \n\nadipate) (PBTA), and poly(butylene succinate adipate) (PBSA) (18, 19). After testing the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n169 \n\neventual cytotoxicity of the developed scaffolds, the next step consisted on the biological \n\nscreening of the most suitable scaffold formulation for bone tissue engineering applications. \n\nFor that, we tested several blends with a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9), \n\npromoting the differentiation into the osteogenic lineage. Results evidenced that the \n\nchitosan\u2013PBS blend formulation, 50% wt, and 60% porosity, showed the best performance in \n\nterms of cell behavior (13). Further studies were performed using human bone marrow \n\nmesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in fiber mesh scaffold morphology, with excellent results, \n\nin terms of cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation (15). Also, osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of these cells onto the scaffolds was consistently detected by the presence of \n\nmineralized ECM (20, 21). Therefore, the fibrous morphology enhanced conditions to \n\npromote cell infiltration into the inner regions of the scaffold. \n\n Thus, the next step is to evaluate this tissue engineering strategy in vivo, using a \n\nfeasible animal model. For that, we have selected the cranial defect in nude mice (22, 23) \n\nsince it enables testing several aspects of this strategy. Calvaria is a flat bone, which allows \n\nthe creation of a uniform circular defect with an adequate size for easier surgical procedure \n\nand specimen handling. Fixation is provided by the dura mater and the overlying skin. The \n\nmodel has been thoroughly used and studied and is well reproduced (22-24). The low \n\nvascularization in cranial area turns this model one of the toughest to evaluate the in vivo \n\nperformance of tissue engineered constructs (25). The nude mouse model is required since \n\nhuman cells will be implanted, avoiding graft rejection responses from the host (20). The \n\ncritical size defect (CSD) for this model is 4-5 mm. A CSD is defined as the intraosseous \n\nwound in a specifically bone and species of animal without spontaneous healing during the \n\nlifetime of the animal (21). \n\n Herein, we have selected compression molded - salt leaching scaffolds. We \n\nconsidered this production method as the most appropriate for the development of scaffolds \n\nthat meet the required dimensions to fit into the animal calvaria defect. In the present study, \n\nwe have assessed the in vitro biological behavior of hBMSCs cultured on Ch-PBS scaffolds, \n\nand these 3D constructs were validated in an in vivo model of a critical cranial defect in nude \n\nmice.  \n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n170 \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Scaffolds production \n\n The scaffolds used in this study were produced by melt based compression molding \n\nfollowed by salt leaching. Briefly, chitosan was melt blended with PBS (50% in weight) by \n\nextrusion and further grinded into a powder. This powder was subjected to a solid mixing with \n\nsalt particles with size between 250 and 500 \u00b5m, and a salt content of 60%. Details on the \n\nprocessing methodology can be found elsewhere (19).  \n\n \n\n2.2. Scaffolds characterization \n\n Cross-sections of all the developed scaffolds were analyzed using a Leica-Cambridge \n\nS-360 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for preliminary assessment on their morphology. \n\nAll the samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to the SEM analysis. \n\n To evaluate the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds, micro computed tomography \n\nequipment (SkyScan, Belgium) was used as a non-destructive characterization methodology. \n\nThree scaffolds were scanned in high resolution mode of 8.7 \u00b5m x/y/z and an exposure time \n\nof 1792 ms. The scanner energy was set to 63 keV with 157 \u00b5A current. \u00b5CT scans followed \n\nby 3-D reconstruction (\u00b5CT analyzer and a \u00b5CT Volume Realistic 3D Visualization, from \n\nSkyScan) of serial image sections allowed to reconstruct and analyze the 3D \n\nmicroarchitecture of the scaffolds, pore morphology, determination of porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity. \n\n \n\n2.3. In vitro cell culture \n\n Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from bone marrow and \n\ncharacterized for the MSC phenotype (26). Cells were expanded in alpha minimum essential \n\nmedium (?-MEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, \n\nGermany), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (PeproTech, USA) and 1% of \n\nantibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).  When a sufficient cell number was \n\nobtained, cells at passage 2 were seeded onto scaffolds at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold. \n\nAfter 24 hours of attachment, constructs were placed in new 24-well plates and 1 ml of \n\nosteogenic medium containing dexamethasone 10-8 M (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ascorbic acid \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n171 \n\n50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ?-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was \n\nadded to each well. The constructs were cultured for 7, 14, and 21 days in a humidified \n\natmosphere at 37\u00baC, containing 5% CO2.  \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Cell adhesion and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\n Cell adhesion, morphology and distribution throughout the scaffolds were analyzed by \n\nSEM. Constructs were fixed and dehydrated using a sequence of ethanol gradients and \n\nfurther sputter coated with gold (JEOL JFC-1100) to analyze using a Leica Cambridge S360 \n\nscanning electron microscope. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Cell viability assay - MTS test \n\n Cell viability was assessed after 3 hours, 7, 14, and 21 days using the MTS test. \n\nConstructs (n=3) were washed in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \n\nimmersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent in a 5:1 \n\nratio and incubated for 3 hours at 37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. \n\nScaffolds alone incubated for the same time in osteogenic medium were used as controls. \n\nAfter this, 200 \u00b5l (n=3) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) was \n\nmeasured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) quantification \n\nSamples were washed with phosphate buffered saline solution and transferred to 1.5 \n\nml microtubes containing 1ml of ultra-pure water. Constructs (n=3) were cryopreserved at -\n\n80\u00baC for further analysis. Prior to ALP quantification, samples were thawed and sonicated for \n\n15 min. \n\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured by the specific conversion of p-\n\nnitrophenol phosphate (pNpp) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The \n\nenzymatic reaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml of substrate buffer \n\ncontaining 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNp. The solution was further \n\nincubated at 37\u00baC for 1 hour and the reaction was stopped by adding a solution containing 2 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n172 \n\nM NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA. The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard curve was \n\nmade using pNp values ranging from 0 to 20 \u00b5mol/ml.  \n\n \n\n2.4. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice \n\n Athymic nude mice with 7 weeks old (Harlan, Jerusalem, Israel) were used to \n\nexamine the healing of cranial critical size bone defects in response to transplants in the \n\ndefects according to the method described previously (20). All procedures involving the use \n\nof animals were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care \n\nand Use Committee of the Technion, Israel.           \n\n The in vitro cell-scaffold constructs were cultured in osteogenic inducing medium for 2 \n\nweeks prior implantation. Each scaffold was seeded with 1x106 cells. All surgeries were \n\nperformed under a protocol approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of the Technion, \n\nIsrael. \n\n Two bilateral critical-size circular defects (5 mm diameter and 1 mm thick) were \n\nperformed with a hand drill and trephine bit in the parietal bones of the skull on either side of \n\nthe sagittal suture line (Figure 1). Care was taken not to damage the sagittal suture or to \n\ninterrupt the dura mater beneath the bone. During the procedure, sterile saline was dripped \n\nover the drilling site in order to avoid extensive heating and to protect the brain. Figure 1 \n\nillustrates the location of the defects in the mice crania. Surgeries were performed under \n\ngeneral anesthesia (xylazine:ketamine, 1:1 solution in saline) by intra peritoneal injection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n173 \n\ndefects were created. Animals were kept under aseptic conditions. After 8 weeks post-\n\nsurgery, animals were euthanized and crania were removed, cleaned, and fixed immediately \n\nin formalin for 24 h to be analyzed by \u00b5CT analysis. Briefly, the mice crania (with or without \n\ncells) were also analyzed using a high-resolution \u00b5CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, \n\nKontich, Belgium). Six specimens were scanned in high resolution mode using a pixel size of \n\n19.13 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source was set at 91 keV of energy and \n\n110 ?A of current. For all the scanned specimens representative data sets of 1023 slices \n\nwere transformed into binary using a dynamic threshold of 255-120, to distinguish bone from \n\npolymeric material. This data was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyzer v1.5.1.5, \n\nSkyScan). 3D virtual models of the mice crania were created, visualized, and registered \n\nusing image processing software (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan).  \n\n \n\n2.5. Statistical analysis \n\nResults of MTS and ALP are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation with n=3 for \n\neach group. Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student?s t-test \n\nmultiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p<0.01). \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Scaffolds characterization \n\n SEM micrographs of the porous scaffolds are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows \n\nscaffolds morphology with 4 mm diameter and 1 mm thick. Previous studies (13, 27, 28) \n\ndemonstrated that these scaffolds had adequate porosity to allow extensive cell proliferation \n\n(Figure 2b). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n174 \n\n  For a detailed characterization of the scaffolds? internal structure, \u00b5CT studies were \n\nconducted. Images of the region of interest were acquired and transformed into binary \n\nimages (Figure not shown). For all scaffolds, a dynamic threshold ranging from 255\u2013150 gray \n\nscale values was used to distinguish polymer material from pore voids. Individual 2D analysis \n\nof the binary images (with a circle of interest of 4.5 mm2) (Figure 2a) was obtained from the \n\nscaffold cross-sections (Figure 2a), consisting of 300 slices (Figure 2b) and used for \n\nmorphometric analysis (Table I). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Representative 2D \u00b5CT image (a) and 3D \u00b5CT image of the scaffold obtained from \n\nthe sequence of 2D sections (b). \n\n \n\nTable I.

The level \n\nof interconnectivity indicates that most of the pores are open and probably allow cell \n\ninfiltration into the scaffold? inner pores.   \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n175 \n\n3.2. In vitro cell culture studies \n\n3.2.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\n SEM analysis showed that cells present a great affinity to the scaffolds surface, which \n\nis evident by the massive cell adhesion at the surface of the scaffolds (Figure 4).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. SEM micrographs of the seeded scaffolds cultured under osteogenic induction, \nafter 1 week (a and b), 2 weeks (c and d) and 3 weeks (e and f).  \n\n \n\n Previous results also showed this cell behavior at the surface of similar scaffolds (15). \n\nAfter only 1 week of culture (Figures 4a and 4b) it was already visible a remarkable cell \n\nproliferation on the 3D structures. At the second week of culture, it was shown that a \n\nmultilayer of cells is covering the surface of the 3D scaffold (Figures 4c and 4d). After 3 \n\nweeks of culture, it was visible that cell proliferation further developed into a dense multilayer \n\ncell structure (Figure 4e). Furthermore, it was clear the presence of Ca-P deposits (Figure \n\n4f), corresponding to the produced mineralized ECM that was visible at higher \n\nmagnifications. These results were confirmed by EDS analysis performed in samples \n\ncultured up to 21 days (Figure 5). Unseeded scaffolds (kept immersed in osteogenic medium \n\nfor the same period of time) were used as control of EDS analysis. The presence of Ca and P \n\npeaks in the spectrum confirmed the presence of Ca and P elements at the surface of the \n\ncell seeded scaffolds, which indicated that cells are producing mineralized ECM and thus \n\nconfirming the osteogenic differentiation after 21 days of culture.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n177 \n\n Cell viability assay (MTS) was used to assess the activity of the cells over time. \n\nResults demonstrated that hBMSCs seeded onto chitosan-PBS scaffolds were able to reduce \n\nMTS substrate and progressively increased its metabolic activity during the time of culture \n\n(Figure 6). The obtained optical density values show a significant increase after 21 days of \n\nculture. These results were corroborated by SEM images (Figure 4), with the increase of cell \n\ncolonization over time. Furthermore, the presence of such active cells just after seeding (time \n\n0), corresponded to a great seeding efficacy, which was due to the preference of the cells for \n\nthese scaffolds, instead of the tissue culture plate. These results were in accordance with \n\nprevious results using different cells cultured onto similar scaffold (13, 15, 27, 28). \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) \n\n The ALP activity of human MSCs cultured onto the scaffolds did not follow the typical \n\ntrend of this marker of osteogenic differentiation, as it is demonstrated after 21 days (Figure \n\n7). After this time point, a significant increase in ALP activity was observed (Figure 7). \n\nUsually, ALP reaches a peak at an earlier time point. However, the presence of visible \n\ndeposits of mineralized matrix after 21 days (SEM images, cell viability and EDS results) \n\nsuggests that cells were viable and continued to deposit matrix, thereby indicating the cells? \n\nosteogenic differentiation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n178 \n\n\u00a0\n\n3.3. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice  \n\n After in vitro studies, the following step involved the in vivo validation, using a suitable \n\nanimal model. For that, constructs were tested using a critical size cranial defect. Briefly, we \n\nplanned a study using the critical size calvaria bone defect in nude mice, using Ch-PBS \n\nscaffolds and human cells. In this way, we were able to test both the viability of the 3D cell-\n\nconstruct in vivo, as well as the ability of those constructs to regenerate bone tissue. Cranial \n\nreconstruction represents a unique model to study bone regeneration, mainly because the \n\ncalvaria is an anatomic area under limited mechanical stress, quite unlike the axial skeleton, \n\nwhich is subjected to long periods of compressive load (29). We used a 5 mm diameter \n\ndefect, based in previous data found in the literature, showing that adult nude mice did not \n\ndemonstrate significant calvaria bone healing in defects of 3, 4 and 5 mm in diameter (20).  \n\n Scaffolds? diameter was optimized to enable some swelling before implantation. \n\nPrevious studies showed that these scaffolds have approximately 21% of water uptake. \n\nBased on these findngs, we have implanted scaffolds with 4.5mm of diameter to match the \n\nsize of the defect at the time of implantation. \n\n Bone formation was evaluated by \u00b5CT. This methodology is a low radiation and a non \n\ninvasive method for studying the structure of bone samples. This technique can generate \n\nhigh-resolution images and provide the accurate quantitative analysis of the bone structure \n\nparameters (30). \n\n Bone possesses some self-healing capacity. However, there is a limit to the size of \n\nbone fractures and defects that can be self-repaired. This limit is designated \u201ccritical size \n\ndefect\u201d (21, 23) and will not heal completely during the lifetime of the patient. For large bone \n\ndefects, medical intervention is often necessary to repair the bone. In this study we have \n\nused hBMSCs cultured onto chitosan based scaffolds, in order to assess the ability of these \n\ntissue engineered constructs to induce bone regeneration in nude mice cranial critical size \n\ndefects. To our knowledge, there are few studies documenting the use of xenogeneic grafs \n\n(i.e., human cells and scaffolds) on the athymic nude mouse model (31-34). We have used \n\nnude mice in order to study the osteogenic potential of the hBMSCs seeded and cultured on \n\nCh-PBS scaffolds, when implanted in a critical size defect. The \u00b5CT results suggested that \n\nafter 8 weeks of implantation, constructs promoted bone regeneration of the calvaria critical \n\nsize defect (Figure 8). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model  \n\n179 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

E \u2013 empty; Sc \u2013 scaffold alone; Sc+MSCs \u2013 scaffolds with \n\nhBMSCs pre-cultured in vitro in osteogenic medium.  \n\n \n\n Micro CT images also support that scaffolds cultured with MSCs presented enhanced \n\nbone ingrowth. Some of the images clearly show an almost complete healing of the defect \n\n(Figures 8b and 8c). These findings are in accordance with previous results where scaffolds \n\nseeded with pre-induced osteogenic MSCs enhanced bone regeneration in critical size defect \n\nwhen the same animal model was used (32). Scaffolds per se were able to induce some \n\nbone regeneration/ingrowth (Figure 8c). New bone formation could be due to invading \n\nreparative cells from the dura or from adjacent host tissues. The selected implantation time \n\nseemed to be adequate for assessing the complete bone healing at the site defect, as shown \n\nin figure 8c. Further studies need to be addressed using these scaffolds without cells, in \n\nimmunocompetent animals, to confirm the tissue regeneration ability of Ch-PBS scaffolds. \n\n \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\n In the present study, chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds were successfully \nproduced by melt-based compression molding followed by salt leaching. The \n\nmicroarchitecture of the scaffolds was assessed by SEM and \u00b5CT, revealing a fully porous \n\nand interconnected 3D structure.  \n\n In vitro cell culture studies using hBMSCs have shown properties compatible with \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone \nrepair in a mouse calvaria model \n\n180 \n\nbone engineering applications. Cells evidenced high levels of viability as a function of \n\ncultured time and well correlated with SEM images that showed extensive cell colonization of \n\nthe scaffolds. The produced ECM showed the presence of Ca and P elements, detected in \n\nEDS spectra of cultured scaffolds? surface, which confirmed the mineralization. Successful \n\nbone regeneration was achieved using the critical size defect in calvaria of nude mice, with \n\nprominent results for the in vitro cell construct compared to the scaffold without cells. \n\n The combination of good biological performance of hBMSCs cultured onto chitosan \n\nbased scaffolds and the ability to regenerate bone tissue in a critical size defect, significantly \n\nexpands previous evidences that these materials can and will have a role to play in bone \n\ntissue engineering strategies.  \n\n This study evidenced very positive results that highlight the possibility of chitosan-\n\nPBS-hBMSCs constructs to be used as implants for non load-bearing bone defects. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\n Ana Costa-Pinto was supported by the scholarship SFRH/24735/2005 from the \n\nPortuguese research council ??Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia??

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n187 \n\nCHAPTER IX \nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n Bone is a complex and dynamic tissue composed of different cell types contributing to \n\nthe maintenance of homeostasis throughout life. Fractures are one of the most common \n\noccurrences associated with the musculoskeletal system. They can result from trauma or \n\nthey can be a side effect of bone related diseases, such as osteoporosis or bone cancer, \n\nwhich weakens the bone and compromises its integrity. One of the most promising therapies \n\nis bone tissue engineering. There are several strategies within this field such as delivery of \n\nisolated autologous cells, associate these autologous cells to an appropriate three-\n\ndimensional (3D) support - scaffold, and/or by incorporating bioactive molecules into \n\nscaffolds in order to promote bone regeneration. \n\n The bone tissue engineering strategy followed under the scope of this thesis was \n\nbased on the use of a biodegradable scaffold that will act as a support for cells to adhere, \n\nproliferate and differentiate into an osteogenic phenotype, creating a bone extracellular \n\nmatrix (ECM). These in vitro structures (constructs) were ultimately implanted in a relevant \n\nanimal model, validating the tissue engineering strategy.  \n\n  The scaffold has a major importance in this strategy and several properties are \n\nrequired in order to be functional. It must have adequate mechanical properties to support the \n\ntissue growth at the bone defect. A highly porous and interconnected structure is required for \n\ncell ingrowth. Furthermore, it should be biodegradable in the human body at a similar rate to \n\nneo-tissue formation. The material used for scaffold production should be non-toxic, non-\n\nimmunogenic and biocompatible. The natural occurring polymer chitosan has emerged as a \n\nsuitable biomaterial to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, since it presents the \n\nadequate characteristics.  \n\n In this thesis, the osteogenic potential of chitosan based scaffolds seeded and \n\ncultured with primary cultures of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) \n\nwas evaluated. In chapter III, different scaffolds containing the same percentage of chitosan \n\nand different aliphatic polyesters poly(butylene succinate), poly(butylene terephtalate \n\nadipate) and poly(caprolactone) were studied, by means of cytotoxicity and direct contact \n\ntests using cell lines. It was demonstrated that all scaffolds produced by compression \n\nmolding followed by salt leaching were cytocompatible and clearly non-toxic to the cells. The \n\ndirect contact evaluation with a mesenchymal stem cell line, under osteogenic culture \n\nconditions, showed that chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) formulation evidenced \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n \n\n188 \n\nsuperior results, when compared to all studied formulations. The previous results raised the \n\nfollowing question: why Ch-PBS formulation promoted superior in vitro cellular response? In \n\norder to answer that question, the work described in chapter IV was designed to study the \n\ninfluence of different percentages of chitosan (0, 25 and 50%) and PBS (100, 75 and 50%) \n\non cell behavior in vitro. The main aim of this study was to analyze the influence of chitosan \n\ncontent on cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of primary cultures of hBMSCs. \n\nScaffolds containing a higher content of chitosan showed greater cell performance, by \n\npresenting major cell adhesion and enhanced cell viability. Furthermore, it evidenced higher \n\nlevels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and upregulation of ostegenic genes. PBS scaffolds \n\n(100%) consistently showed the inferior results in terms of cell performance. Additionally, the \n\nin vivo tissue response was evaluated by implanting the higher chitosan containing \n\nformulation and PBS only, for one month, in different anatomic regions (cranial, auricular and \n\nsubmuscular) of rats. The selection of these regions was performed to verify about different \n\ninflammatory response, based on the degree of vascularization of each tissue. The resident \n\ninflammatory cells were macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and foreign body giant \n\ncells. These types of cells are presented when chronic inflammatory reaction is developed, \n\nand is typical for implanted biomaterials, considered to be normal. The implanted scaffolds \n\ndid not evidence fibrotic encapsulation. PBS scaffolds showed cell necrosis in all tissue \n\nlocations, which is not a positive indication. These results demonstrated that chitosan \n\nshowed a superior effect in terms of cell behavior, both in vitro as in vivo. After the initial \n\nscreening of the proposed chitosan based materials for bone tissue engineering scaffolding it \n\nwas possible to conclude that chitosan is, indeed, relevant to improve the biological \n\nperformance of the scaffolds both in vitro as in vivo in terms of inflammatory response. \n\n In chapter V, chitosan\u2013poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds with a different morphology \nwere produced to optimize cell ingrowth in the previous morphology. The scaffolds were \n\nprepared by a fiber bonding methodology, which allowed obtaining a fiber mesh porous \n\nstructure, with an adequate porosity and interconnectivity. Several studies were conducted to \n\nconclude about cell adhesion, viability, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation onto these \n\nscaffolds structure. The developed scaffolds also evidenced cytocompatibility and no signs of \n\ncytotoxicity by showing excellent cell behavior, in terms of adhesion, proliferation and \n\nviability. Moreover, hBMSCs seeded and cultured onto the 3D structures in osteogenic \n\nculture conditions, evidenced successful osteogenic differentiation by expressing osteogenic \n\nrelated genes, as well as production of a mineralized ECM. This optimized scaffold \n\nmorphology kept the excellent in vitro biological performance of the scaffolds. The next step \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n189 \n\nwas to evaluate the degradation of those scaffolds, both in vitro and in vivo, as reported in \n\nchapter VI. It is known that biodegradation of the scaffold must be at a similar rate as new \n\ntissue is developed, which turns the study of the degradation of the scaffolds used in tissue \n\nengineering a key issue to be analyzed. To study chitosan-PBS degradation in vitro, \n\nenzymes responsible for the degradation of both scaffold components (lipase and lysozyme, \n\nrespectively) were used, in concentrations similar to those in human serum. The weight loss \n\nand water uptake results showed that an enzymatic cocktail with lysozyme and lipase \n\nevidenced a greater effect on the scaffolds degradation in vitro. Moreover, in scanning \n\nelectron microscopy (SEM) micrographs, it was possible to observe cracks in the fibers of the \n\nscaffold structure, being more pronounced for the condition with lipase and lysozyme \n\ntogether. The biodegradation of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was also evaluated in vivo by a \n\nperiod of three months. For that, a subcutaneous rat model was used. After 12 weeks all \n\nscaffolds maintained their structural integrity, denoting a slower degradation kinetics that the \n\none observed in vitro. Host tissue response evidenced a normal chronic inflammatory \n\nresponse. The host tissue response was also assessed. After one week of implantation, it \n\nwas visible an acute inflammatory reaction with the main cells being neutrophils. The \n\nevolution to a chronic inflammatory response was observed at the third week, when the \n\npresence of neutrophils was almost residual and the resident cells were macrophages, \n\nlymphocytes, plasma cells and foreign body giant cells. Alpha smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) \n\nimmunostaining was visible throughout the implant, indicating that connective tissue was \n\ngrowing and the degreed of vascularization increased as a function of time. At the same time, \n\ncollagen was being deposited by fibroblasts, confirmed by Masson\u00b4s thricrome staining that \n\nspecifically stains mature collagen. After 12 weeks, the connective tissue became more \n\norganized, by marked presence of ?-SMA and more giant cells were observed. Longer time \n\nperiods of implantation are required to investigate about the biodegradation of these \n\nscaffolds, both in vitro as in vivo. However, the results obtained showed that the slower rate \n\nof degradation in vivo, as compared to the studied model in vitro, is positive, since the \n\nkinetics of biodegradation needs to match to the kinetics of the neotissue formation. Being \n\nthe scaffolds a temporary support for tissue ingrowth, in the specific case of bone tissue, this \n\ntime frame is not fast. \n\n In the last chapter of this thesis, the tissue engineering strategy herein described was \nvalidated in vivo. For that, it was used a critical size defect in calvaria of nude mice, which \n\nallows to use human MSCs by excluding the immune response mediated by T cells. The \n\ncranial defects used were considered critical size defects with a diameter of 5 mm and two \n\nfor each animal. The hBMSCs were pre-cultured in osteogenic conditions on chitosan-PBS \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\n \n\n190 \n\nscaffolds obtained by compression molding followed by salt leaching. After assessing the in \n\nvitro biological performance of the hBMSCs seeded and cultured onto the scaffolds, in \n\nosteogenic culture conditions, these constructs were implanted into cranial defects in nude \n\nmice, demonstrating some bone regeneration with chitosan-PBS scaffolds per se, although \n\nthe most prominent results were observed for in vitro matured constructs. These results \n\nconfirm several reports described in the literature, where cell perform a key role in bone \n\nformation.  \n\n The work developed in this PhD thesis leads to the conclusion that chitosan-\n\npoly(butylene succinate) scaffolds in combination with autologous bone marrow MSCs have \n\nall the requisites in vitro as in vivo to design effective bone tissue engineering strategies.  \n\n It is, however, important to continue the research on these chitosan based scaffolds. \n\nOne of the hypotheses is to assess the degree of bone regeneration in large animal models, \n\ncombining the scaffolds with autologous cells pre-cultured in osteogenic culture conditions. \n\nOther hypothesis is to use other source of cells, different from bone marrow. Fetal stem cells \n\nare in the front line of regenerative medicine field, mostly due to its easy accessibility and \n\nassociated non-immunogenicity, which turns these cells adequate to be used in an allogenic \n\nsetting, avoiding issues of donor morbidity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4\n\ttese  ana rita.pdf\n\tChapter 0_vf.pdf\n\tChapter I.pdf\n\tChapter II_vf.pdf\n\tChapter III.pdf\n\tChapter IV.pdf\n\tChapter V.pdf\n\tChapter VI.pdf\n\tChapter VII.pdf\n\tChapter VIII.pdf"}]}}}
