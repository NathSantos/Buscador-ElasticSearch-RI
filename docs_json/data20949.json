Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa, February, 2004. Physiological \nand morphological adaptations as associated with drought tolerance in robusta coffee \n(Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou). Major Advisor: F\u00e1bio Murilo DaMatta. Advisors: \nElizabeth Pacheco Batista Fontes and Marcelo Ehlers Loureiro \n \n\n \n\nClones of Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou with contrasting tolerance to drought stress \n\nhave been chosen on the basis of their productivities under rainfed conditions. As little is \n\nknown about physiological mechanisms associated with differences in drought tolerance in \n\nthose clones, this work aimed to examine morphological traits, stomatal responses to both soil \n\nand atmosphere drought, water relations, water-use efficiency (WUE) and, in addition, \n\nwhether drought tolerance in C. canephora may be linked to protection against oxidative \n\ndamage. For these purposes, four clones of C. canephora representing drought-tolerant (14 \n\nand 120) and drought-sensitive (46 and 109A) genotypes were grown under screen house \n\nconditions, in 120 L pots, during eight months. Drought stress was imposed by withholding \n\nirrigation until leaf water potential at predawn (?pd) reached about \u20133.0 MPa. Under full \n\nirrigation, soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (KL), midday leaf water potential and total \n\nbiomass were all greater in clones 109A and 120 than in the other clones. After 14 days \n\nwithout irrigation, ?pd decreased significantly in clone 109A in comparison with the other \n\nclones; seven days latter, ?pd dropped to about \u20132.3 MPa in clones 46 and 109A, against \u20130.8 \n\nMPa in clone 14 and \u20131.7 MPa in clone 120. Clone 109A attained \u20133.0 MPa at predawn \n\nearlier, followed by clone 46, clone 120, and then clone 14, in this order. Under drought \n\nstress, there was no elastic adjustment, while a slight osmotic adjustment was only noted in \n\nthe clone 109A. Stomatal conductance (gs) was strongly decreased with decreasing ?pd; it \n\ndeclined modestly with increasing leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit. Stomatal sensitivity to \n\nboth soil and atmospheric drought was lower in clone 109A and similar among the other \n\nclones. Drought stress led to a significant increase in carbon isotope composition (?13C) for all \n\n\n\n 2\n\nclones, suggesting an increased WUE; however, absolute values of ?13C were lower in clone \n\n109A than in the other clones irrespective of the irrigation treatments. Clones 14 and 120 \n\nexhibited deeper root systems than drought-sensitive clones. This at least partially explain \n\ntheir better avoidance to drought as compared with the sensitive clones. On average, the larger \n\nKL in clone 120 than in clone 14 might largely explain why the latter was better able to \n\npostpone dehydration. For all clones, water potential, gs and KL recovered rapidly following \n\nre-watering; these facts, associated with the remarkable stomatal sensitivity to drought, should \n\nexplain greatly why C. canephora responds strongly to irrigation. Independently of the clone \n\nexamined, little or no effect of drought on the quantum yield of electron transport, \n\nphotosystem II photochemical efficiency and photochemical and non-photochemical \n\nquenching coefficients was observed. Comparatively, the clone 120 showed a more tolerant \n\nphotosynthetic apparatus to both drought and paraquat-induced oxidative stress, with no clear \n\ndistinction among the other clones in this regard. Drought triggered increases in superoxide \n\ndismutase (clones 109A and 120), ascorbate peroxidase (clones 14, 46 and 109A), catalase \n\nand guaiacol peroxidase (clones 46 and 109A), and glutathione reductase (clone 46). \n\nMonodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase were not induced in \n\ndrought-stressed plants; their maximal activities were much lower than that of ascorbate \n\nperoxidase, irrespective of the clone investigated. Oxidative damage, however, appeared to be \n\nevident only in clone 109A. In general, the clones herein investigated were able to preserve, \n\nor even to increase, their antioxidant defences at water potentials as low as \u20133.5 MPa. The \n\ncombination of mechanisms that effectively postpone dehydration, associated with deep root \n\nsystems, should contribute to survival and/or stability of crop yield of drought-tolerant clones \n\nin regions with unpredictable precipitation. Attributes such as osmotic and elastic adjustments \n\nand protection against oxidative damage induced by drought should be of minor importance to \n\ndrought tolerance in this specie. \n\n\n\n 3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEXTRATO \n\n \n\n \n\nPINHEIRO, Hugo Alves, D.S.

Para isso, quatro clones (46 e 109A, sens\u00edveis; 14 e 120, tolerantes \u00e0 seca) foram \n\ncultivados em casa de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, em vasos de 120 L, durante oito meses. O d\u00e9ficit h\u00eddrico foi \n\nimposto via suspens\u00e3o da irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, at\u00e9 que o potencial h\u00eddrico na antemanh\u00e3 (?am) atingisse \n\n\u20133,0 MPa. Os clones 109A e 120, sob irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, apresentaram maior condut\u00e2ncia hidr\u00e1ulica \n\nentre a raiz e a parte a\u00e9rea (KL), maior potencial h\u00eddrico ao meio-dia e maior ac\u00famulo de \n\nbiomassa. Ap\u00f3s 14 dias de suspens\u00e3o da irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, ?am foi significativamente mais negativo \n\nno clone 109A que nos outros clones; sete dias ap\u00f3s, ?am decresceu para \u20132,3 MPa nos clones \n\nsens\u00edveis \u00e0 seca, contra \u20130,8 MPa e \u20131,7 MPa nos clones 14 e 120, respectivamente. O clone \n\n109A foi o primeiro a atingir \u20133,0 MPa na antemanh\u00e3, seguido pelo clone 46, clone 120 e, por \n\nfim, pelo clone 14. N\u00e3o foi observado ajustamento el\u00e1stico em nenhum dos clones, enquanto \n\num ajuste osm\u00f3tico de pequena magnitude foi limitado ao clone 109A, sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de seca. \n\nA condut\u00e2ncia estom\u00e1tica (gs) foi reduzida fortemente em resposta aos decr\u00e9scimos em ?am e, \n\nem menor extens\u00e3o, aos incrementos no d\u00e9ficit de press\u00e3o de vapor entre folha e atmosfera. A \n\nsensibilidade estom\u00e1tica \u00e0 seca, tanto do solo quanto da atmosfera, foi menor no clone 109A e \n\nsimilar entre os demais clones. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica do carbono (?13C) aumentou \n\n\n\n 4\n\nsignificativamente, sob seca, em todos os clones, sugerindo incrementos em EA; o clone \n\n109A, entretanto, apresentou valores mais negativos de ?13C, independentemente do regime \n\nde irriga\u00e7\u00e3o. A profundidade do sistema radicular foi substancialmente maior nos clones \n\ntolerantes que nos sens\u00edveis \u00e0 seca. Isso pode explicar, pelo menos em parte, a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\num status h\u00eddrico mais favor\u00e1vel nos clones tolerantes. O maior valor m\u00e9dio de KL no clone \n\n120, sob seca, poderia explicar as diferen\u00e7as de status h\u00eddrico entre ele e o clone 14. Em todos \n\nos clones, gs, KL e o potencial h\u00eddrico recuperaram-se rapidamente ap\u00f3s a re-irriga\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nplantas sob d\u00e9ficit h\u00eddrico; isso, aliado \u00e0 forte sensibilidade estom\u00e1tica \u00e0 seca, pode estar \n\nassociado \u00e0 resposta not\u00e1vel dessa esp\u00e9cie \u00e0 irriga\u00e7\u00e3o. Independentemente do clone estudado, \n\na seca pouco ou nada afetou o transporte de el\u00e9trons, a efici\u00eancia fotoqu\u00edmica do fotossistema \n\nII e os coeficientes de extin\u00e7\u00e3o fotoqu\u00edmico e n\u00e3o-fotoqu\u00edmico. Comparativamente, o clone \n\n120 apresentou maior toler\u00e2ncia de seu aparelho fotossint\u00e9tico ao estresse oxidativo mediado \n\npela seca ou por a\u00e7\u00e3o do paraquat, com poucas diferen\u00e7as observadas entre os demais clones \n\nnesse contexto. Sob seca, observaram-se incrementos significativos nas atividades da \n\ndismutase do super\u00f3xido (clones 109A e 120), peroxidase do ascorbato (clones 14, 46 e \n\n109A), catalase e peroxidase do guaiacol (clones 46 e 109A), e redutase da glutationa (clone \n\n46). As atividades da redutase do monodesidroascorbato e da redutase do desidroascorbato \n\nn\u00e3o foram afetadas pelos tratamentos aplicados; as atividades dessas enzimas foram \n\nsubstancialmente menores que a da peroxidase do ascorbato. O d\u00e9ficit h\u00eddrico acarretou danos \n\noxidativos apenas no clone 109A. De modo geral, os clones avaliados foram capazes de \n\nmanter, ou mesmo de aumentar, a atividade de seus sistemas de defesa contra danos \n\noxidativos, mesmo a potenciais h\u00eddricos da ordem de \u20133,5 MPa. Em suma, a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmecanismos que efetivamente restringem a perda d\u2019\u00e1gua, associada a sistemas radiculares \n\nprofundos, deve ser decisiva para a sobreviv\u00eancia e, ou, relativa estabilidade da produ\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nclones de C. canephora tolerantes \u00e0 seca, quando cultivados em ambientes sujeitos a secas \n\nprolongadas. Atributos como ajustes osm\u00f3tico e el\u00e1stico e prote\u00e7\u00e3o contra danos oxidativos \n\nmediados pela seca teriam uma import\u00e2ncia secund\u00e1ria na determina\u00e7\u00e3o da toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 \n\ndefici\u00eancia h\u00eddrica nessa esp\u00e9cie. \n\n\n\n 5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\nAmong more than 90 species of Coffea, only C. arabica L. and C. canephora Pierre \n\n(robusta coffee) are economically important worldwide. The volume of business generated \n\nfrom robusta on the international coffee market has been steadily increasing for half a century, \n\nand presently this species accounts for about 35% of the coffee consumed worldwide. \n\nRobusta coffee is believed to have evolved in a lowland forest of the Congo river basin \n\n(Africa), with a typical equatorial climate in which average temperature is between 24 and 26 \noC, and with abundant rainfall distributed over a 9-10 month period, and atmospheric \n\nhumidity at a nearly constant level approaching saturation (Coste 1992, Willson 1999). Under \n\nplantation schemes, a necessary minimum annual rainfall of 1250 mm, or even 1550 mm, has \n\nbeen quoted, but this would require an even distribution (Coste 1992). \n\nThe most cultivated variety of C. canephora in the world is robusta and, thus, it \n\ndesignates the common name of this specie. However, in the main Brazilian area producing C. \n\ncanephora (Esp\u00edrito Santo State), kouillou is the single variety cropped. Despite a large \n\nsimilarity between these two varieties, kouillou differs from robusta particularly by presenting \n\nlonger leaves and smaller fruits and beans. Furthermore, kouillou is considered to be more \n\nresistant to drought than robusta (Coste 1992). In Esp\u00edrito Santo State, there is an increasing \n\ntrend in expanding cultivation towards marginal and degraded area lands where water \n\navailability constitutes the bottleneck to crop yield. In these areas, during the dry season, \n\nwhich lasts from four to seven months, evaporation by far exceeds rainfall and, within the \n\nrainy season, rainfall pattern and amounts are to a great extent unpredictable. Such conditions \n\ncould be expected to largely restrict the productive potential of robusta coffee. Local \n\nexperience has shown that crop yield under rainfed conditions may decrease by about 40% or \n\neven as much as by 80% in dry years. Irrigation has been successfully employed, enabling the \n\nplant to be a profitable crop and preventing crop failure in dry years. However, costs involved \n\nfor purchasing and installing irrigation equipment are rather expensive and immediately pose \n\na problem for the profitability of its use, particularly in small farms where robusta coffee is \n\n\n\n 6\n\nmostly cultivated. In addition, a permanent, reliable source of water for irrigation is not \n\nalways available. \n\nRobusta coffee is an obligate cross-pollination species and, therefore, a wide population \n\nvariation in morphological/physiological traits to cope with drought is to be expected \n\n(DaMatta and Rena 2001). Plant breeders of INCAPER (Institute for Research and Rural \n\nAssistance of the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo) have successfully explored such genetic variability, \n\nso that clones of robusta coffee with superior performance under rainfed conditions have been \n\nrecently selected, what may render coffee cultivation less dependent on irrigation. \n\nNonetheless, such selection has been conducted largely in terms of saleable crop (e.g. Ferr\u00e3o \n\net al 2000a, b), without physiologically examining how clones respond to soil drought. \n\nThe ability for a crop to produce satisfactorily in areas subjected to water deficit has been \n\ntermed drought tolerance regardless of how the ability develops (Kramer and Boyer 1995). \n\nPlants may develop morphological and/or physiological mechanisms to cope with a limited \n\nwater conditions. These involve maximisation in water uptake by growing deep roots and/or \n\nminimisation of water loss by way of an effective stomatal closure and reduced leaf area \n\n(Kramer and Boyer 1995), improving plant water status and turgor maintenance. In any case, \n\nin the field, water deficit is generally combined with high solar radiation, triggering an \n\nenhanced production of reactive oxygen species, which may result in oxidative damage to cell \n\ncompartments, especially chloroplasts (Smirnoff 1995) and, ultimately, in decreases in crop \n\nyield. To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress, plants must dissipate \n\nexcess light energy. This can be achieved by down-regulation of the photochemical efficiency \n\nby way of the xanthophyll cycle (Demming-Adams et al. 1996) or by maintenance of electron \n\nflux involving alternative routes such as photorespiration and the Mehler-peroxidase pathway \n\n(Asada 1999, Ort and Baker 2002). Morphological adaptations such as leaf rolling and \n\nalterations in leaf orientation can also contribute to decrease photo-inhibitory damage and \n\nexcessive transpiration. \n\nIn this work, it were explored the extent and mechanisms of intra-specific variation of \n\nwater use in C. canephora var. kouillou by examining how stomatal behaviour and leaf water \n\nrelations are adjusted to changes in soil water supply and evaporative demand, and how \n\ndifferences in drought tolerance is associated with morphological characteristics such as root \n\ndepth and leaf area. In addition, it was also examined whether differences in clonal tolerance \n\nto drought stress could be associated with an enhanced protection of the photosynthetic \n\napparatus against oxidative stress. For these purposes, drought-tolerant genotypes (clones 14 \n\nand 120) and drought-sensitive ones (clones 46 and 109A) of robusta coffee were compared. \n\n\n\n 7\n\nThese clones have been shown to produce a good crop when grown under irrigation; under \n\nlimited soil water, however, both survival and productivity (Ferr\u00e3o et al. 2000a, b) as well as \n\nmaintenance of tissue water status (DaMatta et al. 2000, 2003) are impaired to a greater extent \n\nin the drought-sensitive than in the drought-tolerant clones. The clones were grown in large \n\ncontainers in an attempt to simulate a natural development of drought down a root profile, so \n\nthat the plants could acclimate to decreasing soil water availability. \n\n\n\n 8\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\nAsada, K., The water-water cycle in chloroplasts: scavenging of active oxygen and dissipation \n\nof excess photons, Annu.

Four clones representing drought-\n\ntolerant (14 and 120) and drought-sensitive (46 and 109A) genotypes were grown in 120-l \n\ncontainers under screen house conditions. Drought was imposed by withholding watering \n\nuntil xylem pressure potential (?x) reached about \u20133.0 MPa at predawn. Under full irrigation, \n\nsoil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (KL), midday ?x and total biomass were all greater in \n\nclones 109A and 120 than in the other clones. For all clones, dehydration postponement was \n\nmore important than dehydration tolerance. This was associated with (i) strong stomatal \n\nsensitivity to soil drying and, to a lesser extent, to leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit; (ii) \n\nincreases in leaf carbon isotope composition in stressed plants, suggesting higher water-use \n\nefficiency; and (iii) relatively high modulus of elasticity. Dehydration postponement was less \n\ndeveloped in drought-sensitive clones than in drought-tolerant ones, which might in part to be \n\n\n\n 11\n\nassociated with shallower root systems in the former than in the latter. Clone 109A had the \n\nleast conservative water-use characteristics and, thus, it showed a faster decline in ?x than \n\nclone 46 after suspending irrigation. On average, the larger KL in clone 120 than in clone 14 \n\nmight explain why the latter was better able to postpone dehydration. There was no evidence \n\nof elastic adjustment in response to drought, whereas osmotic adjustment was small and \n\nlimited to clone 109A.

Plants may develop morphological and/or physiological mechanisms \n\nto cope with a limited water supply. These involve maximisation in water uptake by growing \n\ndeep roots and/or minimisation of water loss by way of an effective stomatal closure and \n\nreduced leaf area (Kramer and Boyer 1995), improving plant water status and turgor \n\nmaintenance. Turgor maintenance, which provides the potential for keeping physiological \n\nactivity for extended periods of drought, may be achieved through an osmotic adjustment \n\nand/or changes in cell wall elasticity (Kramer and Boyer 1995, Turner 1997). \n\nRobusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre), which accounts for about 35% of the coffee \n\nconsumed worldwide, is native to typical African equatorial climate zone with abundant \n\nrainfall distributed over a 9-10 month period, and atmospheric humidity at a nearly constant \n\nlevel approaching saturation (Willson 1999). For this reason, robusta is thought to have \n\nevolved as a water-profligate species (DaMatta and Rena 2001). However, in Brazil it has \n\nbeen largely cultivated in marginal areas where water availability constitutes the major \n\nenvironmental constraint affecting crop production. Consequently, irrigation has been \n\nindispensable for production in those areas where even short periods of drought can largely \n\ndecrease coffee yields. \n\n\n\n 12\n\nRobusta coffee is an obligate cross-pollination species and, therefore, a wide population \n\nvariation in morphological/physiological traits to cope with drought is to be expected \n\n(DaMatta and Rena 2001). Plant breeders have successfully explored such genetic variability, \n\nso that clones of robusta with superior performance under rainfed conditions have been \n\nrecently selected, what may render coffee cultivation less dependent on irrigation. \n\nNonetheless, such selection has been conducted largely in terms of harvestable crop (e.g., \n\nFerr\u00e3o et al 2000a, b), without examining physiologically how clones respond to soil drought. \n\nIn this work, drought-tolerant genotypes (clones 14 and 120) and drought-sensitive ones \n\n(clones 46 and 109A) of robusta coffee were compared. These clones have been shown to \n\nproduce a good crop when grown under irrigation; under limited soil water, however, both \n\nsurvival and productivity (Ferr\u00e3o et al. 2000a, b) as well as maintenance of tissue water status \n\n(DaMatta et al. 2003, Pinheiro et al. 2004) are impaired to a greater extent in the drought-\n\nsensitive than in the drought-tolerant clones. Comparatively, however, maintenance of water \n\nstatus is better, but stability of crop yield is poorer, in clone 14 than in clone 120. An initial \n\nobjective of this study was to identify mechanisms of intra-specific variation of water use by \n\nexamining how stomatal behaviour and leaf water relations are adjusted to changes in soil \n\nwater supply and evaporative demand. A second objective was to assess whether differences \n\nin drought tolerance is associated with morphological characteristics such as root depth and \n\nleaf area. For these purposes, morphological traits, leaf xylem pressure potential (?x), \n\nstomatal conductance (gs), hydraulic conductance (KL), stable carbon isotope composition, \n\n?13C (to study integrated plant water use; Farquhar et al. 1989), and water relations \n\nparameters derived from pressure-volume curves were evaluated. The clones were grown in \n\nlarge containers in an attempt to simulate a natural development of drought down a root \n\nprofile, so that the plants could acclimate to water shortage. Leaf water relations were \n\nexamined at a similar internal water status, thus allowing more reliable comparisons among \n\nclones to be made. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nGeneral \n\nClones of C. canephora Pierre var. kouillou (known in Brazil as Conilon) raised as rooted \n\nstem cuttings were obtained from the Institute for Research and Rural Assistance of Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto State (INCAPER), Brazil. Forty plants (10 per each clone) were grown under screen \n\nhouse conditions in Vi\u00e7osa (20o45\u2019 S, 650 m a.s.l.), southeastern Brazil, with an average \n\nmidday photosynthetic photon flux about 900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, in large containers (0.8 m high, \n\n\n\n 13\n\n0.44 m internal diameter) filled with an 120 l mixture of soil, sand and hardened manure \n\n(3:1:1, v/v/v) and a gravel layer at the bottom. The walls of the screenhouse consisted of \n\ncoarse mesh screen, which permitted free exchange of air with the external environment. \n\nWhen plants were 12-months old, water deficit was imposed by withholding watering until ?x \n\nat predawn (?pd) reached about \u20133.0 MPa. Throughout the dry-down period, five sets of \n\nmeasurements of ?x and gs were performed using leaves from the third or fourth pair from the \n\napex of plagiotropic branches. Once the desired ?pd was reached, expanding leaves (less than \n\nhalf of their final size) were collected and their ?13C was estimated; expanded leaves were \n\nalso collected for obtaining pressure-volume relationships. All the plants were then irrigated \n\n(at about 1800 h) and ?x and KL were estimated in the following two consecutive days (?pd \n\nmeasured at about 12 and 36 h after irrigation). \n\n \n\nBiometric measurements \n\nThree branches per tree were tagged when water was withheld, and their growth was \n\nestimated as the difference between initial and final length, as measured 21 days latter. At the \n\nend of the experiment, well-watered plants were harvested and separated into aboveground \n\nparts and roots. Leaf area was measured with an area meter (Area Measurement System, \n\nDelta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Roots were washed thoroughly with tap water above a \n\n0.5-mm screen sieve. Plant tissues were then oven-dried at 72 \u00b0C for 72 h, after which dry \n\nmatter was determined. Shoot height and root depth were also measured. \n\n \n\nWater relations \n\nXylem pressure potential was measured at predawn (0430-0530 h), between 0700-0900 h and \n\nat midday (?md) using a Scholander-type pressure chamber. To obtain pressure-volume \n\ncurves, fully expanded leaves were collected by cutting their petioles under deionised water \n\nand brought to the laboratory. This was done at about 12 h after irrigating both control and \n\ndrought-stressed plants (?x typically above \u20130.10 MPa). Subsequently, fresh weight and ?x \n\nwere taken at intervals during dehydration process (free transpiration technique) until a ?x of \n\nabout \u20133.5 MPa was reached. Turgid weight was estimated from the linear relationship \n\nbetween fresh weight and ?x in the positive turgor range, by extrapolating to ?x = 0. The \n\ninverse of ?x was plotted as a function of relative water content (RWC). From the pressure-\n\nvolume curves, the osmotic potential at full (?? (100)) and zero (?? (0)) turgor, RWC at zero \n\n\n\n 14\n\nturgor (RWC(0)) and the bulk modulus of elasticity (?; Melkonian et al. 1982) were estimated. \n\nFurther details are described in DaMatta et al. (1993). \n\n \n\nStomatal and hydraulic conductance \n\nStomatal conductance to water vapour was measured with a portable open-system infrared gas \n\nanalyser (LCA-4, ADC, Hoddesdon, UK), as described in DaMatta et al. (1997). \n\nMeasurements were made between 0700 and 0900 h (25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C air temperature, 90 \u00b1 2% air \n\nrelative humidity) and between 1100 and 1300 h (30 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C air temperature, 80 \u00b1 2% air \n\nrelative humidity). \n\nLeaf specific hydraulic conductance from soil to leaf (KL = (gs x ?w)/(?pd \u2013 ?md)) was \n\ncalculated using ?pd to approximate soil water potential, and gs and ?w (leaf-to-air vapour \n\npressure deficit, estimated according to Landsberg (1986)), measured at the same time as ?md \n\n(Hubbard et al. 1999, Donovan et al. 2000). \n\n \n\nCarbon isotope composition \n\nLeaf ?13C was measured relative to the international PBD standard using a mass spectrometer \n\n(Delta-S, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany), as previously described (DaMatta et al. 2002). \n\nDifferences in ?13C from duplicates for each sample were below 0.2\u2030. \n\n \n\nStatistics \n\nThe experiment was set up in a completely randomised design, with eight treatment-\n\ncombinations, forming a 4 x 2 factorial (four clones and two watering regimes) with five \n\nplants per treatment-combination. The experimental plot was constituted by one plant per \n\ncontainer. Significant differences among treatment means were tested by the Newman-Keuls \n\nand F tests, at P ? 0.05. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between \n\nphysiological and/or environmental variables. The relationship between gs and ?pd was non-\n\nlinear and data were natural log transformed for the analysis. Based on regression analysis, ln \n\ngs was found to be significantly linearly related to ?pd. \n\nA test for the equality of the regression models was performed using the indicator variable \n\ntechnique (Neter and Wasserman 1974), at P ? 0.05. Regression models for clones 14, 46 and \n\n120 did not differ statistically to each other. Therefore, data for these clones were pooled \n\ntogether and single regressions were fitted to the lumped data. \n\n\n\n 15\n\nResults \n\nThe selected clones (14 and 120, drought-tolerant; 46 and 109A, drought-sensitive) could be \n\ngrouped into two types of contrasting canopy morphologies, with clones 109A and 120 being \n\ntaller (Table 1) with less dense crowns than clones 14 and 46. There was no significant \n\ndifference in both total leaf area and specific leaf area among the clones investigated, but total \n\ndry matter and root biomass were greater in clones 109A and 120 than in clones 14 and 46, \n\nwhereas root to shoot biomass ratio were larger in clone 109A than in the other clones (Table \n\n1). In any case, the drought-tolerant clones exhibited a considerably deeper (Table 1), more \n\nregularly distributed root system down a pot profile than the drought-sensitive clones (not \n\nshown). \n\nFor control plants, ?pd was always above \u20130.08 MPa. In these plants, average ?md tended \n\nto be lower in clones 14 and 46, respectively \u20130.89 and \u20131.06 MPa, against \u20130.65 MPa in \n\nclones 109A and 120 (Figure 1). On average, KL tended to be higher in these clones (about 3.0 \n\nmmol m-2 s-1 MPa-1) than in clones 14 and 46 (about 1.7 mmol m-2 s-1 MPa-1). Under drought \n\nstress, average KL tended to be greater in clone 120 than in the other clones (Figure 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

See details in Figure 1. \n\n\n\n 18\n\nAfter withholding irrigation for 14 days, ?pd was significantly lower in clone 109A than \n\nin the other clones; seven days latter, ?pd dropped to about \u20132.3 MPa in clones 46 and 109A, \n\nagainst \u2013 0.8 MPa in clone 14 and \u20131.7 MPa in clone 120. A similar trend, but obviously \n\nshifted to lower values, was found for ?md (Figure 1). As could be expected from the above, \n\nclone 109A attained \u20133.0 MPa at predawn earlier, followed by clone 46, clone 120, and then \n\nclone 14 in this order (Figure 1). A prompt recovery of ?x and KL was found for all clones in \n\nthe first two days upon re-watering (Figures 1 and 2). \n\nStomatal conductance decreased curvilinearly as ?pd declined (Figure 3).

Values of gs were taken at 0700-0900 h and represent \n\nthe entire data set from plants subjected to a dehydrating cycle after selecting a narrow range \n\nof leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (1.5 kPa at most). The data were fitted by a power \n\nfunction of the form y = axb by nonlinear regression in the insets, and by linear regression in \n\nthe main panels. The explained variance (r2) was similar for both linear and nonlinear \n\nregressions. \n\n\n\n 19\n\nAs ?w increased, gs decreased linearly in a similar way in clones 14, 46 and 120. By \n\ncontrast, there was no relationship in clone 109A between gs and ?w (Figure 4). In spite of ?w \n\nand leaf temperature being greatly associated to each other (r2 = 0.920, P &lt;0.001), co-\n\nvariation analysis revealed no direct effect of leaf temperature in the response of gs to ?w (P = \n\n0.173). \n\nClonal differences in drought tolerance could hardly be associated with either or both \n\nosmotic and elastic adjustments, since ?? (100), ?? (0) and ?  did not differ significantly among \n\nclones under full irrigation or drought conditions, with exception of the clone 109A, in which \n\ndrought resulted in a slight, significant decrease (0.19 MPa) in ?? (0) (Table 2).

Stomatal conductance (gs) in relation to leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (?w) in \n\nfour clones of robusta coffee under irrigated conditions. Data were obtained over several days \n\nunder conditions of naturally fluctuating ?w; they were collected at 1100\u20131300 h in plants \n\ngrown under full irrigation to insure a comparable internal water status (xylem pressure \n\npotential = -0.8 \u00b1 0.2 MPa). For clone 109A, relationship between gs and ?w was not \n\nsignificant. \n\n\n\n 20\n\nAfter imposing water deficit, ?13C increased significantly (1.48 to 2.22\u2030; Figure 5) in all \n\nclones, suggesting an increased long-term water-use efficiency (WUE). Nonetheless, absolute \n\nvalues of ?13C were lower in clone 109A than in the other clones irrespective of the irrigation \n\ntreatments. There was no difference in ?13C among clones 14, 46 and 120 (Figure 5). Overall, \n\ngs decreased to a greater extent than net carbon assimilation rate (data not shown) and, thus, \n\nadjustments in ?13C should have been predominantly from changes in gs. \n\nUnder continuous irrigation, clone 109A showed a larger branch growth (28%) than the \n\naveraged growth of the other clones, in which branch growth did not differ regardless of the \n\nwatering treatments (Figure 6). Under drought conditions, branch growth decreased by about \n\n45% in drought-sensitive clones against a 31% reduction in clone 14 and 37% in clone 120. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nPlant water stress developed more slowly in the drought-tolerant than in the drought-sensitive \n\nclones. Morphological traits such as leaf area, root mass or root to shoot mass ratio were not \n\nassociated with that response. Instead, the much deeper root system of the tolerant clones \n\nshould have enabled them to gaining a greater access to soil water and, therefore, maintaining \n\na more favourable internal water status longer than in drought-sensitive clones. Differences \n\nbetween drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive clones in postponing tissue dehydration are \n\neven more evident in the field (DaMatta et al. 2000, 2003), where the development of the root \n\nsystem is much less restricted. Differences in dehydration postponement were also linked to \n\nstomatal control on transpiration (see below). \n\nHydraulic conductance is positively associated with rates of water use, as has been found \n\nin genotypes of C. arabica (Tausend et al. 2000). Thus the larger KL, as observed in clones \n\n109A and 120 under full irrigation, might at least partially explain their smaller variations in \n\n?x (as indicated by higher ?md values) than in clones 14 and 46, which may help to avoid \n\nlimitations to photosynthesis. As a consequence, the clones 109A and 120 might have \n\nachieved a greater carbon gain, which would to some extent explain their greater biomass \n\naccumulation. This would be advantageous with non-limiting soil water or with brief periods \n\nof water deficit, but disadvantageous with long-term drought since a high KL may hasten the \n\ndevelopment of severe internal water deficit. This could be partially offset by a deeper root \n\nsystem as is the case of clone 120. \n\nStomatal conductance decreased sharply with decreasing ?x, with no apparent threshold \n\nvalue of ?pd at which stomatal closure was observed. This behaviour had been already \n\n\n\n 21\n\nreported for young plants of three coffee species, including robusta (Kanechi et al. 1995b), \n\nand also for other tree species (e.g., Menzel and Simpson 1986, Gucci et al. 1996, Arndt et al. \n\n2001, Xu and Balocchi 2003). The positive relation between gs and ?x is expected when soil \n\nmoisture changes and indirectly affects stomata through a hydraulic feedback (Jones 1998). \n\nThe rapid recovery of ?x after re-watering, which was accompanied by the recovery of gs, \n\nemphasise the role of leaf water status on stomatal control, as suggested by Fuchs and \n\nLivingston (1996). When considered together, these responses should explain greatly why \n\nrobusta coffee responds strongly to irrigation (DaMatta 2004).  \n\nStomatal sensitivity to evaporative demand, as observed in clones 14, 46 and 120, might \n\nindicate the setting up of a feedforward response that would allow them to avoid large internal \n\nwater deficits (Meinzer et al. 1993). Such a sensitivity appears to be weaker in robusta coffee \n\nthan in C. arabica since in the latter gs decreases curvilinearly with increasing ?w (Guti\u00e9rrez \n\net al. 1994, Kanechi et al. 1995a). Because C. arabica evolved in a region relatively drier than \n\nrobusta, the requirement for an efficient stomatal control on transpiration would not thus be as \n\nimperative in robusta as in C. arabica (DaMatta 2003). In fact, the lower sensitivity of gs to \n\n?w in the clone 109A might represent an adaptation to the humid climate of the equatorial \n\nregion where robusta coffee is believed to have evolved. In this clone, stomatal responses to \n\nboth soil and atmospheric drought should have resulted in a more prodigal use of water and, \n\nas a consequence, in more negative ?13C (lower long-term WUE) regardless of the watering \n\nregime. This observation is partially in line with those of Meinzer et al. (1990a). They showed \n\nthat genotypes of C. arabica with higher carbon isotope discrimination (lower ?13C) under \n\nfull irrigation depleted soil water more rapidly and experienced symptoms of physiological \n\nstress earlier when water was withheld. One must be cautious, however, since this study was \n\nsmall to provide a conclusive answer about the usefulness of ?13C as an index for ranking \n\nclones of robusta coffee in terms of drought tolerance. \n\nOsmotic adjustment has been associated with reduced stomatal sensitivity and maintenance \n\nof gas exchange under drought conditions (Turner 1997). In this work, however, its amplitude \n\nwas too small and limited to clone 109A. Thus osmotic adjustment could hardly explain the \n\nlow stomatal sensitivity to drought in this clone. Incidentally, development of increased leaf \n\nwater deficits upon discontinuing irrigation may be faster in coffee genotypes having greater \n\namplitude of osmotic adjustment (Meinzer et al. 1990b, DaMatta et al. 1993). Therefore, \n\nosmotic adjustment should be of limited importance (Munns 1988) in determining drought \n\ntolerance in robusta coffee, as has also been reported for several other woody species (Fan et  \n\n\n\n 22\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Where it occurs, osmotic adjustment either may not persist for long under drought, \n\nor functions over a limited range of ?x-values (Blake et al. 1991). \n\nThe clones herein evaluated lost turgor at values of ?x between \u20132.1 and \u20132.4 MPa. They \n\nshowed relatively high values of ? (i.e., greater tissue rigidity), which resulted in high RWC(0), \n\nas already reported earlier (DaMatta et al. 1993, 2002, 2003). These traits were consistent \n\nwith the strong stomatal sensitivity to water deficit mediated by rapid loss of turgor as a \n\nconsequence of inelastic leaf tissues (White et al. 2000). One must be cautious, however, \n\nbecause changes in relative symplast volume rather than changes in leaf turgor per se were \n\nassociated with stomatal aperture, as shown by Meinzer et al. (1990b) working with cultivars \n\nof C. arabica subjected to drought. In any case, maintenance of high RWC at low ?x appears \n\nto be a means of the coffee tree avoiding, instead of tolerating, dehydration (DaMatta et al. \n\n1993). \n\nThe drought-induced reduction in branch growth could not be associated with adjustments \n\nin cell wall extensibility or in osmotic properties. Since elongation growth is sensitive to \n\nchanges in turgor pressure (Kramer and Boyer 1995), the smaller decreases in growth of the \n\ndrought-tolerant clones than those of the drought-sensitive ones should have been largely a \n\nconsequence of the maintenance of a better water status for longer in the former. Such \n\nassumption might also explain, at least in part, the differences in branch growth between the \n\nclones 14 and 120. \n\nIn conclusion, clonal ability to postpone dehydration was more important than dehydration \n\ntolerance, and cell water relations were largely unable to adjust to drought stress in either \n\nclone. The clone 109A, although possessing greater root to shoot mass ratio, is shallow-rooted \n\nand showed a relatively poor stomatal control on transpiration; these features could explain \n\nwhy it experienced symptoms of drought stress earlier after suspending irrigation. The clone \n\n46 is also shallow-rooted but exhibited a better stomatal sensitivity to both soil and \n\natmospheric drought; hence the clone 46 was better able to delay dehydration than the clone \n\n109A. Similarly to clone 46, stomatal sensitivity to drought was well developed in clones 14 \n\nand 120, but these clones showed a remarkably deeper root system than the drought-sensitive \n\nclones, which could explain their better avoidance to drought. In any case, the larger KL in \n\nclone 120 than in clone 14 might be involved in the faster decrease in ?pd in the former. \n\nFinally, the direct response of stomata to changes in ?x and ?w should have important \n\nconsequences for clonal ability to support relatively long periods of soil drought associated \n\nwith high atmospheric evaporative demand. Such behaviour would be advantageous for the \n\ncoffee clones, allowing for maximisation of WUE and survival as soil water availability \n\n\n\n 25\n\ndecreases. In this case, stomatal sensitivity to soil drying should be negatively associated with \n\nstability of crop yield under rainfed conditions. However, stomata may not respond to soil \n\nwater limitations as readily and dramatically in mature field-grown trees as in young plants \n\nlike those of this study with less expanded root systems (Gucci et al. 1996, DaMatta 2003). If \n\nso, a deeper root system compensating for water loss during the day would be of paramount \n\nimportance. Of course, this should be possible if the plant maintains a sufficient KL. Thus, \n\ncombination of deep roots with relatively large KL should contribute to dampen variations \n\nboth in plant water status and productivity, as particularly observed in the clone 120 grown in \n\nseasonally-dry regions that experience satisfactory annual precipitation (Ferr\u00e3o et al. 2000a, \n\nDaMatta et al. 2003). \n\n \n \nAcknowledgements  \n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Institute for Research and Rural Assistance of the \n\nState of Esp\u00edrito Santo (INCAPER) \u2013 Brazil, for providing the coffee seedlings.

Drought-\n\ntolerant clones were better able to maintain their leaf water status than drought-sensitive \n\nclones after withholding irrigation. Regardless of the clones investigated, the net carbon \n\nassimilation rate decreased under drought stress, but little or no effect of drought on the \n\nquantum yield of electron transport was observed. The photosynthetic apparatus of clone 120 \n\nwas more tolerant to both drought and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, with no clear \n\ndistinction amongst the other clones in this regard. Drought triggered increases in superoxide \n\ndismutase (clones 109A and 120), ascorbate peroxidase (clones 14, 46 and 109A), catalase \n\nand guaiacol peroxidase (clones 46 and 109A), and also in glutathione reductase (clone 46) \n\nand dehydroascorbate reductase (clone 109A). Activity of monodehydroascorbate reductase \n\nwas not induced in drought-stressed plants. Maximal catalytic activities of the two last \n\nenzymes were much lower than that of ascorbate peroxidase, irrespective of the clone \n\ninvestigated. No drought-induced decrease in enzyme activity was found, except for \n\nglutathione reductase in clone 120. In any case, oxidative damage appeared to be evident only \n\nin clone 109A. Overall, there was no apparent link between protection against oxidative stress \n\nwith differences in clonal tolerance to drought.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Acclimation; Antioxidant enzymes; Coffee; Gas exchange; Paraquat; Water deficit \n\n__________________________________ \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nUpon moderate drought conditions, photosynthesis decreases mainly due to stomatal \n\nclosure. As the stress progresses, biochemical constraints may limit the photosynthetic CO2 \n\nfixation more directly [1]. Excess energy may result, which is potentially harmful to \n\nphotosystem (PS) II because of over-reduction of photosynthetic electron chain and increased \n\nproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts [2]. Additionally, mitochondria \n\nand peroxisomes are also potential producers of ROS [2,3]. \n\nTo protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress, plants must dissipate excess \n\nlight energy. This can be achieved by down-regulation of the photochemical efficiency by \n\nway of the xanthophyll cycle [4] or by maintenance of electron flux involving alternative \n\n\n\n \n\n 31\n\npathways such as photorespiration and the Mehler-peroxidase reaction [2,5]. However, both \n\npathways lead to an increased production of ROS such as superoxide (O2\n\u00b7\u2014) and H2O2. To \n\ncope with ROS, plants are endowed with a complex enzymatic antioxidant system including \n\nsuperoxide dismutases (SOD), which catalyse the reaction from O2\n\u00b7\u2014 to H2O2, and catalase \n\n(CAT) and enzymes of the ascorbate (Asc)/glutathione (GSH) cycle, which function to \n\ndetoxify the H2O2 produced [2,6]. A guaiacol-type peroxidase (GPX) can also participate in \n\nH2O2 scavenging. In addition, detoxification of ROS can be conducted by means of \n\nantioxidant molecules, both lipophilic (?-tocopherol, ?-carotene) and hydrophilic (Asc, \n\nGHS). The latter can act as direct scavengers for ROS, and both compounds are also \n\nreductants in the Asc/GSH cycle [6]. Failure in antioxidant defence system may result in \n\noxidative damage to several cell constituents such as proteins, DNA and membrane lipids [2]. \n\nIf drought stress proceeds slowly, an array of time-dependent morphological and \n\nphysiological acclimation responses may occur, thus largely expanding the range and kind of \n\nplant responses that can take place with soil water shortage [7]. Despite this, many studies \n\nconcerning drought effects on tree crop physiology have been conducted using plants grown \n\nin small containers that limit root growth. Such an approach does not allow the phenomenon \n\nof acclimation to occur, with observations largely dependent on the rate of stress progression \n\n[7]. Another feature of many experiments resides in comparisons among species or genotypes \n\nafter they suffer from a given period without irrigation. Comparisons made under such \n\ncircumstances may be misleading since plants ordinarily show quite variable internal water \n\nstatus. \n\nRobusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre) is largely cultivated in drought-prone areas, thus \n\nleading to crop failure in dry years. There seems to be considerable clonal variation in drought \n\ntolerance within this species [8]. Working with two clones submitted to rapidly imposed \n\ndrought, Lima et al. [9] proposed that drought tolerance in Robusta coffee might be at least \n\npartially associated with enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. In fact, increased \n\nexpression of the antioxidant system has been associated with decreased oxidative damage in \n\ndifferent drought-tolerant species or genotypes [10]. In this study, the major goal was to test \n\nthe hypothesis that drought-tolerant clones differ from drought-sensitive ones at a biochemical \n\nlevel, through enhanced protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress. \n\nFor this purpose, leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, the enzymatic \n\nantioxidant system, Asc redox state, lipid peroxidation, as well as tolerance to oxidative stress \n\nmediated by paraquat were investigated. The clones were grown in large containers in an \n\nattempt to simulate a natural progression of drought down a root profile, so that the plants \n\n\n\n \n\n 32\n\ncould acclimate to water shortage. Plant responses were also measured at a similar internal \n\nwater status allowing more reliable comparisons among clones to be made. \n\n \n\n \n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Plant material, growth conditions and sampling procedures \n\nFour coffee clones representing drought-tolerant (14 and 120) and drought-sensitive (46 \n\nand 109A) genotypes were used. The selected clones have been shown to produce a good crop \n\nwhen grown under irrigation; under limited soil water, however, both survival and \n\nproductivity are severely impaired in the drought-sensitive clones, with minor effects in the \n\ndrought-tolerant ones, as has been observed in field experiments of the Institute for Research \n\nand Rural Assistance of the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil [Rom\u00e1rio Ferr\u00e3o, personal \n\ncommunication]. In addition, tolerant clones are better able to maintain their tissue water \n\nstatus upon discontinuing irrigation than drought-sensitive clones [11].  \n\nPlants obtained as rooted stem cuttings were four months old at planting. They were grown \n\nunder greenhouse conditions, with an average midday photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) \n\nabout 900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, in large containers (0.8 m high, 0.44 m internal diameter) filled with \n\nan 120 l mixture of soil, sand and hardened manure (3:1:1, v/v/v) and a gravel layer at the \n\nbottom. When the plants were 12 months old, water deficit was imposed by withholding \n\nwatering until leaf water potential (?w), as measured periodically with a Scholander-type \n\npressure chamber, reached around \u20133.0 MPa at predawn (about \u20133.5 MPa at midday). All \n\nsampling and measurements were made using leaves from the third or fourth pair from the \n\napex of plagiotropic branches. For biochemical analyses, leaf tissue (0.3 g FW per tree for \n\neach parameter), collected at about midday, was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \n\n\u201380oC until processing. For paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, four leaf discs (1 cm2 each) \n\nper tree were collected and immediately assayed. \n\n \n\n2.2. Biometric data \n\nLeaf area was measured with an area meter (Area Measurement System, Delta-T Devices, \n\nCambridge, UK). Roots were washed thoroughly with tap water above a 0.5-mm screen sieve. \n\nPlant dry mass was determined after drying plant material at 72oC for 72 h. Shoot height and \n\nroot depth were also measured. \n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\n2.3. Responses to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress \n\nLeaf discs, collected from well-watered plants, were floated with adaxial side up on 0, 5 \n\nand 15 \u00b5M paraquat. In a preliminary experiment, discs vacuum-infiltrated with paraquat \n\nsolutions were compared with discs to which paraquat was allowed to be absorbed freely, \n\ngiving similar results. Discs  were then exposed for 16 h at 25\u00b0C in the dark to allow paraquat \n\ndiffusion into them, following by incubation for 3 h at PPF of 200 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. \n\nSubsequently, leaf discs were dark-incubated for 3 h at 25oC. The paraquat-dependent ROS \n\ndamage was estimated according to [12], from the reduction of the variable to maximum \n\nfluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm), measured as described below. \n\n \n\n2.4. Photosynthetic parameters \n\nThe net carbon assimilation rate (A), internal to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (Ci/Ca) \n\nand stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) were measured at 0800-0900 hours under \n\nartificial, saturating PPF (850-900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) with a portable open-system infrared gas \n\nanalyser (LCA-4, ADC, Hoddesdon, UK), as described in [13]. Chlorophyll a fluorescence \n\nwas measured with a portable pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer (FMS2, Hansatech, \n\nKing\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) using actinic PPF of 900 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 for 480 s and an 1-s pulse \n\nof saturating light of 6000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Measurements of the Fv/Fm ratio were made \n\nfollowing dark-adaptation for 30 min. Further technical details have been given previously \n\n[9,14]. Photochemical quenching coefficient (qp), Stern-Volmer non-photochemical \n\nquenching coefficient (NPQ) and the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (?PSII) were \n\ncalculated as described in [15]. The fraction of PPF absorbed in PSII antennae that was \n\nneither used in photochemistry nor dissipated thermally (PE) was calculated according to [4]. \n\nAll the above measurements were carried out at ambient CO2, 25 \u00b1 2 \noC air temperature and \n\n80 \u00b1 2% relative humidity. \n\n \n2.5. Biochemical assays \n\nLeaf tissue was ground in a cold mortar and pestle using polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and the \n\nfollowing extraction buffers: SOD, EC 1.15.1.1 [100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 \n\nmM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; CAT, EC \n\n1.11.1.6 and Asc peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) [50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mM \n\nEDTA, 20 mM Asc and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) \n\n[100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 \u00b5M EDTA, 10 mM isoascorbate, 9 mM 2-\n\nmercaptoethanol, 3 mM DTT and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; monodehydroascorbate (MDA) \n\n\n\n \n\n 34\n\nreductase (MDAR, EC 1.6.5.4) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) \n\n[100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Asc and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-\n\n100]; and GPX, EC1.11.1.7 [50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Asc \n\nand 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]. The resulting slurry was centrifuged at 20000 g for 20 min. \n\nSupernatants were collected and used for enzymatic assays and determination of protein \n\ncontent [16]. For MDAR and DHAR, enzyme extract was previously gel-filtered over \n\nSephadex G-25 columns. All the above operations were conducted at 0-4 \u00b0C. \n\nActivities of total SOD, APX and CAT were determined as described earlier [9]. Activities \n\nof GR and DHAR and activity of MDAR were assayed by measuring the rate of NADPH and \n\nNADH oxidation, respectively, both at 340 nm. A suitable amount of enzyme extract and the \n\nfollowing reaction media were used: GR (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM oxidised GSH, 3 \n\nmM MgCl2, and 0.15 mM NADPH) [17], MDAR (50 mM K-phosphate buffer under N2 \n\natmosphere, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NADH, 400 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM \n\nAsc and 0.14 units Asc oxidase for generating MDA) [18] and DHAR (50 mM K-phosphate \n\nbuffer, pH 6.1, 0.2 mM NADPH, 2.5 mM GSH, 2.5 mM DHA and 0.6 units GR) [19]. GPX \n\nactivity was determined following the increase in absorbance at 470 nm using a reaction \n\nmixture containing 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM guaiacol and \n\n10 mM H2O2 [20]. Where appropriate, controls were run to correct for interferences. Enzyme \n\nactivities were expressed on a total protein basis since the overall leaf protein concentration, \n\neither on a dry mass or on an area basis, remained largely unaffected under drought \n\nconditions. Indeed, enzyme activities were quite similar regardless of expressed on an area or \n\non a protein basis (data not shown). \n\nAsc and DHA were determined as described in [21], with some modifications. Leaf tissue \n\nwas ground in 6 ml 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and the resulting slurry was centrifuged at \n\n10000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. A 20 \u00b5l aliquot of the supernatant was diluted to 500 \u00b5l using 5% \n\n(w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Total Asc (Asc + DHA) was determined after reduction of DHA by \n\nDTT. To 500 \u00b5l diluted sample extract were added 250 \u00b5l 0.06% (w/v) DTT/ethanol and 250 \n\n\u00b5l 0.2 M Na2HPO4-1.2 M NaOH. The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C. \n\nSubsequently, the following reagents, dissolved in absolute ethanol, were added: 250 \u00b5l \n\n0.24% (w/v) N-ethylmaleimide, 250 \u00b5l 4% (v/v) H3PO4, 500 \u00b5l 0.5% (w/v) \n\nbathophenanthroline and 500 \u00b5l 0.03% (w/v) FeCl3, in a 2.5 ml final volume. The mixture \n\nwas vigorously mixed and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 90 min. The resulting absorbance was read at \n\n\n\n \n\n 35\n\n534 nm. Asc was determined as described above, with omission of DTT. DHA was deduced \n\nfrom the difference of total Asc and Asc. \n\nMalondealdehyde (MAld), assayed as described in [9], was used as an estimation of lipid \n\nperoxidation. \n\n \n\n2.6. Statistics \n\nThe plants were distributed over a completely randomised single-tree plot design, with \n\neight treatment-combinations, forming a 4 x 2 factorial (four clones and two watering \n\nregimes) with four or five replicates. For biochemical data, each replicate represented the \n\nmean of three determinations on the same sample. Data were statistically examined using \n\nanalysis of variance and tested for significant (P ? 0.05) clone and irrigation treatment \n\ndifferences using Newman-Keuls and F tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Biometric traits and water status \n\nThe selected clones (14 and 120, drought-tolerant; 46 and 109A, drought-sensitive) could \n\nbe grouped into two types of contrasting canopy morphologies, with the clones 109A and 120 \n\nbeing taller (Table 1) with less dense crowns than the clones 14 and 46. There was no \n\nsignificant difference in total leaf area among the clones evaluated, but root biomass and root \n\nto shoot biomass ratio were greater in clone 109A than in the other clones (Table 1). \n\nHowever, the root system was about 50% deeper in the drought-tolerant than in the drought-\n\nsensitive clones (Table 1); additionally, the tolerant clones exhibited a more regularly \n\ndistributed root system down a pot profile than the drought-sensitive ones (not shown). This \n\nmight be partially linked to the slower rate of decline in predawn ?w in the former than in the \n\nlatter clones after withholding irrigation (Table 2). In fact, in the field, where the development \n\nof the root system is much less restricted, tolerant clones appear to postpone tissue \n\ndehydration to a remarkable greater extent than sensitive clones [11]. Thus, in addition to \n\npossessing a deeper root system, the tolerant clones might also deplete accessible soil water \n\nmore sparingly than the drought-sensitive clones. These features may contribute to buffer crop \n\nyield of the tolerant clones when compared with the sensitive clones in drought-prone areas \n\n[Rom\u00e1rio Ferr\u00e3o, personal communication]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 36\n\n3.2. Responses to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress \n\nParaquat was used in order to test the hypothesis that clones of Robusta coffee considered \n\nto be drought-tolerant would have higher inherent ability to cope with oxidative stress than \n\nclones considered to be drought-sensitive. As deduced from the decreases in Fv/Fm ratio (Fig. \n\n1), clones 14 and 46 suffered from a similar oxidative stress, regardless of the paraquat \n\nconcentration employed. At 5 \u00b5M paraquat, clones 109A and 120 were better protected \n\nagainst paraquat than clones 14 and 46. However, defence mechanisms were not as effective \n\nin clone 109A as in clone 120 since Fv/Fm decreased further in the former, but not in clone \n\n120, as paraquat concentration was increased from 5 to 15 \u00b5M. As a whole, no clear \n\ndistinction concerning differential tolerance to paraquat between drought-sensitive and \n\ndrought-tolerant clones could be established. However, defence mechanisms to scavenge ROS \n\nwere comparatively more effective in clone 120, affording better protection to its \n\nphotosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress. \n\n \n\n3.3. Photosynthetic parameters \n\nWith the exception of clone 120, drought led to approximately parallel decreases in both gs \n\nand A, 81 and 75% for clone 14, 93 and 83% for clone 46, and 58 and 51% for clone 109A, \n\nrespectively. However, Ci/Ca did not decrease accordingly (Table 2). This could mean a \n\nhigher inhibition of photosynthesis by non-stomatal factors than by stomatal ones. It is  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

In contrast, in clone 120 gs \n\ndecreased to a greater extent than A (respectively 73 and 40%), which was accompanied by a \n\nsignificant decrease (14%) in Ci/Ca (Table 2). Thus it may be proposed that stomatal \n\nlimitations rather than stress-induced dysfunctions at the chloroplast level accounted largely \n\nfor the reductions in A in clone 120. \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n14 120 46 109A\n\nF\nv\n\n / \nF\n\nm\n\nAaAa AaAa\n\nAb\n\nBb\nBb\n\nAb\n\nBb\n\nBb\n\nBc\n\nAb\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nDrought-tolerant\nclones\n\nDrought-sensit ive\nclones\n\n1.0\n\n0 \u00b5M PQ 5 \u00b5M PQ 15 \u00b5M PQ\n\n\n\n \n\n 38\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Each value represents the mean \u00b1 SE of five replicates. \n\n\n\n \n\n 39\n\nIn spite of the strong decreases in A, only minor changes in photochemical parameters \n\nwere observed in drought-stressed plants (Table 2), as already shown for Robusta coffee \n\n[9,14]. In clone 14, a slight decline (35%) in ?PSII was greatly associated with decreased \n\navailability of electron acceptors downstream of PSII, as deduced from the 29% reduction in \n\nqP. In clone 120, only a discrete depression (28%) in thermal energy dissipation, analysed as \n\nNPQ, was found. Overall, the present results indicate that electron transport under drought \n\nstress was maintained, similarly as in control plants. Since photosynthetic CO2 fixation \n\ndeclined sharply, a surplus of excitation light energy should have occurred, which could \n\npotentially lead to photoinhibition and photodamage. However, PE increased significantly \n\n(34%) only in clone 14. Because treatment effect on Fv/Fm was not found (suggesting that \n\nphotoinhibition did not occur) and leaf gas exchange and photochemical parameters returned \n\nto control levels rapidly upon rewatering (measured 12 h latter; data not shown), it may be \n\nsuggested that drought stress in this experiment did not cause a long-term effect on the \n\nphotosynthetic apparatus. In any case, since electron transport continued at high rates in \n\ndrought-stressed plants, an increase in the capacity of alternative electron acceptor routes such \n\nas photorespiration and Mehler-peroxidase pathway is to be expected [2,5,10]. \n\n \n\n3.4. Drought-induced defence mechanisms against oxidative stress \n\nUnder drought conditions, SOD activity was not induced in clones 14 and 46, but increased \n\nabout 45% in clones 109A and 120, as compared with control plants (Fig. 2). This increase \n\nleads to enhanced production of H2O2 [6,10]. Thus in clone 109A, the possible H2O2 build-up \n\ncould be attended by increases in activities of APX (45%), CAT (74%) and GPX (43%) (Fig. \n\n3). By contrast, protection against oxidative stress mediated by SOD might be at first glance \n\nlimited in clone 120 since no co-ordinate increase in H2O2 scavenging system was observed \n\n(Fig. 3). However, there was no apparent oxidative damage in clone 120, conversely to what \n\nhappened in clone 109A (see below). \n\nNon-SOD scavenging of O2\n\u00b7\u2014 may also occur through direct reactions with Asc or GSH \n\n[6,10]. This suggests that non-enzymatic O2\n\u00b7\u2014 removal might be possible, particularly in \n\nclones 14 and 46 in which SOD activity was not induced by drought. Since this alternative \n\npathway also leads to H2O2 production, corresponding increases in antioxidants and/or \n\nenzymes involved in H2O2 removal are to be expected [22]. In clone 14 of the six enzymes \n\nherein evaluated involved in post-SOD reactions only APX, which has a much higher affinity \n\nfor H2O2 than either CAT or GPX, increased (38%) as a result of drought (Fig. 3).

Effects of drought on concentration of ascorbate \u2013 Asc (A), Asc redox state (B), and \n\nmalondealdehyde \u2013 MAld (C), of four clones of Robusta coffee (white columns, control \n\nplants; grey columns, drought-stressed plants). Statistics as in Fig. 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 43\n\nof the actual activities in vivo, they do reflect the potential and, thus, the capacity for the use \n\nof different substrates. \n\nChanges in APX were not accompanied by alterations in MDAR (Fig. 3B), while DHAR \n\ntended to increase in response to drought, but only in clone 109A it increased (55%) \n\nsignificantly (Fig. 3C). GR activity increased (67%, clone 46), decreased (48%, clone 120) or \n\nremained unaffected (clones 14 and 109A) in drought-stressed plants when compared with \n\nirrigated ones (Fig. 3D). In addition, maximal extractable activities of MDAR, DHAR and GR \n\nwere considerably lower than that of APX (Fig. 3). When taken together, these data support \n\nthe hypothesis that direct photoreduction of MDA (probably by ferredoxin), which is formed \n\nupon peroxidation of Asc, has predominated over enzymatic routes. Similar assumptions have \n\nbeen reported for other species [23,24,25]. \n\nDifferences in Asc levels were not significant among clones regardless of the watering \n\nregime (Fig. 4A). Drought caused a decrease in DHA in clone 46 (data not shown) and, as a \n\nresult, an increase in Asc redox state (Asc/Asc + DHA) was only observed in this clone (Fig. \n\n4B). In clone 109A, drought induced an 18% increase in lipid peroxidation (estimated as \n\nMAld), but not in the other clones. Also, absolute values of MAld in clone 109A were about \n\n34% larger than those averaged over the drought-stressed plants of the other clones (Fig. 4C). \n\nThis could be an indication that leaf tissues from clone 109A suffered from oxidative stress. \n\nBy contrast, acclimatory changes in antioxidant system appeared to be sufficient to prevent \n\noxidative damages in the other clones investigated. \n\nIt was previously demonstrated that rapid imposition of water deficit (predawn ?w = \u20133.0 \n\nMPa) in clones 109A and 120 resulted in considerable increases in some antioxidant enzyme \n\nactivities, especially in clone 120 (e.g. 2- and 5.6-fold for SOD in clones 109A and 120, \n\nrespectively), but changes in enzyme activities did not prevent cellular damages, particularly \n\nin clone 109A [9]. The present results indicate that, if water deficit proceeds slowly, the \n\ncoffee plants can acclimate to drought and, as a consequence, they could largely avoid \n\noxidative stress. This is in agreement with the fact that plants are more tolerant of a water \n\nshortage when the stress is imposed gradually [26,27]. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n\nUnder the experimental conditions, drought-tolerant clones were better able to maintain \n\ntheir leaf water status than drought-sensitive clones after withholding irrigation. In part, this \n\nmight be associated with a deep root system in the former. Induction of defence mechanisms \n\n\n\n \n\n 44\n\nagainst oxidative stress triggered by drought was greater in drought-sensitive than in drought-\n\ntolerant clones. This might be an indication of increased oxidative processes suffered by the \n\nsensitive clones. However, there was no apparent link between oxidative damage with \n\ndifferences in clonal tolerance to drought. For example, no clear distinction between the \n\ndrought-tolerant clone 14 and the drought-sensitive clone 46, in terms of defence mechanisms \n\nto cope with oxidative stress, could be established. Clone 120 showed a comparatively more \n\ntolerant photosynthetic apparatus to both drought and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress. The \n\ndata presented allow other physiological insight into high degree of drought tolerance in \n\nRobusta coffee [8,28] taking into consideration that no long-term effect of drought on the \n\nphotosynthetic apparatus had occurred; additionally, the clones herein investigated were able \n\nto preserve, or even to increase, their antioxidant defences at ?w as low as \u20133.5 MPa. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge the Institute for Research and Rural Assistance of the State of Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto (INCAPER), Brazil, for providing the coffee seedlings.

The clone 109A, although possessing greater root to shoot mass ratio, is \n\nshallow-rooted and showed a relatively poor stomatal control on transpiration; these features \n\ncould explain why it experienced symptoms of drought stress earlier after suspending \n\nirrigation. The clone 46 is also shallow-rooted but exhibited a better stomatal sensitivity to \n\nboth soil and atmospheric drought; hence the clone 46 was better able to delay dehydration \n\nthan the clone 109A. Similarly to clone 46, stomatal sensitivity to drought was well developed \n\nin clones 14 and 120, but these clones showed a remarkably deeper root system than the \n\ndrought-sensitive clones, which could explain their better avoidance to drought. In any case, \n\nthe larger soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance in clone 14 might be involved in the slower \n\ndecrease in its predawn xylem pressure potential than in the clone 120. The prompt recovery \n\nof water potential, stomatal conductance and soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance following re-\n\nwatering, altogether with the remarkable stomatal sensibility to soil drought, should explain \n\ngreatly why robusta coffee responses strongly to irrigation. \n\nInduction of defence mechanisms against oxidative stress triggered by drought was greater \n\nin drought-sensitive than in drought-tolerant clones. This might be an indication of increased \n\noxidative processes suffered by the sensitive clones. However, there was no apparent link \n\nbetween oxidative damage with differences in clonal tolerance to drought. For example, no \n\nclear distinction between the drought-tolerant clone 14 and the drought-sensitive clone 46, in \n\nterms of defence mechanisms to cope with oxidative stress, could be established. Overall, the \n\npresent data lend support to explain the high degree of drought tolerance in robusta coffee \n\ntaking into consideration that no long-term effect of drought on the photosynthetic apparatus \n\nhad occurred. Additionally, the clones herein investigated were able to preserve, or even to \n\n\n\n \n\n 48\n\nincrease, their antioxidant defences at water potentials as low as \u20133.5 MPa. In any case, clonal \n\ndifferences in drought tolerance in robusta coffee should be greatly determined by the \n\ncombination of mechanisms that effectively postpone dehydration and, associated with deep \n\nroot systems, they should contribute to survival and/or stability of crop yield of drought-\n\ntolerant clones in regions with unpredictable rainfall. Attributes such as osmotic and elastic \n\nadjustments and protection against oxidative damage induced by drought are unlikely to be of \n\nmajor importance to drought tolerance in this specie."}]}}}
