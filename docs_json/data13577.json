Each month 18 biologic samples \nwere taken, six substrate samples were analyzed for sediment grain size and organic matter \ncontent and sediment deposition rates were determined by 12 sediment traps every two \nweeks. Salinity, water temperature, water level and estuarine freshwater discharge were \nmeasured daily. Abiotic parameters and bivalve densities were tested among months with \nregistered mortality events by ANOVA (One-way, p = 0.05), being the E.\u00a0 mactroides \nseasonal variability tested by Kruskal-Wallis (p = 0.05). Regression analyses among abiotic \nparameters and Spearman\u2019s \u201cR\u201d correlation analyses between biological and environmental \ndata were both performed; Results: Two periods were identified with distinct features: \none at the beginning of the study when observed limnetic conditions in the estuarine \nregion were caused by the ENSO - El Ni\u00f1o 2002/2003 phenomenon when an absence \nof E. mactroides was registered as well as a higher percentages of fine sediments and lower \npercentages of organic matter. The second period was characterized by a decreasing \ninfluence of the El Ni\u00f1o and predominance of mixohaline conditions, recruitments and \nincreasing densities of E. mactroides with a successive decrease of mean densities due to \nthree mortality events, lower percentages of fine sediments and higher percentages of \norganic matter; Conclusions: The present study provides evidences that the occurrence \nof E. mactroides in the southern estuarine region depends on the water flow regime from \nthe drainage basin, which characterizes species recruitment as temporally unpredictable \nand affects its persistence through time due to adverse conditions that influence species \ndevelopment like events of fine sediment deposition.\n\nKeywords: Erodona mactroides, recruitment, El Ni\u00f1o, estuary, Patos Lagoon.\n\nResumo: Objetivo: O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a \nvariabilidade temporal de Erodona mactroides e os par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos da coluna d\u2019\u00e1gua \ne do substrato em uma enseada rasa da regi\u00e3o estuarina da Lagoa dos Patos, sul do Brasil; \nM\u00e9todos: As amostras foram coletadas com um extrator de PVC (10 cm de di\u00e2metro), \nenterrado a 10 cm no interior do sedimento, entre Outubro/02 e Dezembro/04.

This bivalve inhabits large areas \nat the Patos Lagoon upper portion, where all \nsize classes are found and high densities of adults \noccur, while southwards in the estuarine region \nonly juveniles were observed (Bemvenuti\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n1978; Cap\u00edtoli\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1978). Recently, temporal \nvariability analysis of macrozoobenthos in Patos \nLagoon estuary showed that high densities of the \nbivalve occur associated with limnetic conditions \n(Colling\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007).\n\nThe larvae of E. mactroides of the adult \nreproductive stock in the upper estuary which are \ncarried by ebb tides to the south during spring and \nsummer, give origin the observed recruitments \nin sheltered embayments in southern estuarine \nregions. At these sites, juvenile massive mortalities \nwere observed on later autumn, suggesting that the \nobstruction of their filtration system apparatus may \nbe the cause of death due to deposition of suspended \nmatter (Bemvenuti, 1997b).\n\nConcerning the general size, the bivalve \nlengths range between 0.42-43.22 mm in Laguna \nRocha - Uruguay (Jorcin, 1996) and between \n1.00-35.00\u00a0 mm in the Patos Lagoon, where \nindividuals smaller than 20 mm were considered \njuveniles (Geraldi, 2002). Inside the Pando Stream, \nUruguay, Passadore\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2007) reported organisms \nsmaller than 14 mm as recruits.\n\nConsidering that larval input from the upper \nestuary to the southern region depends on the \ntemporal variability of the systems water discharge, \nthe present work aimed to evaluate if recruitment \nof E. mactroides at the lower estuary during spring/\nsummer may be influenced by stochastic events \nlike the El Ni\u00f1o phenomena. Besides the water \ncolumn characterization, recruitment periods and \nbivalve densities, this work also aimed to investigate \nthe temporal variability of E. mactroides densities \n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe mollusc Erodona mactroides Bosc, 1802 is \none of the most abundant bivalves found at the \nmixohaline regions of rivers, lagoons and estuaries \nin southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina (Costa, \n1971; Jorcin, 1996), occurring at Rio de la Plata \naffluent rivers near Buenos Aires (Carcelles, 1941) \nand also at Laguna Rocha, as well as streams and \nrivers along the Uruguayan coast (Jorcin, 1996; \nMuniz and Venturini, 2001). Along the coast of \nthe State of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil, \nthe species is found at high densities in the Patos \nLagoon estuary (Rosa-Filho and Bemvenuti, 1998; \nBemvenuti and Netto, 1998), where is a common \nmacrobenthic species (Rosa and Bemvenuti, 2007; \nColling\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007).\n\nThis Erodonidae species is inequivalve with the \nright valve large and convex, displaying subtrigonal \nshells with anterior side rounded and posterior \nrostrate (Rios, 2009). As a subsurface inhabitant and \nsuspension feeder, this species plays an important \necological role in the Patos Lagoon due to the \nexposure of its shell in the bottom surface, which can \nbe considered the unique biological hard substrate \nfor macrobenthic communities on soft bottoms, \nallowing the attachment of epibionthic organisms \n(Bemvenuti\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1978). As a consequence of \nits high abundance and wide distribution in the \nPatos Lagoon, E. mactroides is considered the main \nphytoplankton consumer among macrobenthic \ninvertebrates (Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), being \nresponsible for an important energy flux from the \nwater column to the benthic environment, in which \nthe species is reported as an important food item \nfor major decapod and fish species (Ara\u00fajo, 1984; \nBemvenuti, 1997a).\n\nThe first records of E. mactroides in the Patos \nLagoon were reported by von Ihering (1885), \nwhile another study, concerning the distribution of \nThecamoeba and Foraminifera species, mentions the \npresence of this species in the southern portion of \nthe lagoon (Closs, 1962). The spatial distribution \nof the macrobenthic fauna in the Patos Lagoon \n\ndo El Ni\u00f1o e predomin\u00e2ncia de condi\u00e7\u00f5es mixohalinas, recrutamentos e pelo aumento \ndas densidades m\u00e9dias de E. mactroides com sucessivos decr\u00e9scimos no n\u00famero de \norganismos devido a tr\u00eas eventos de mortalidade, menores percentuais de sedimentos finos \ne maiores percentuais de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica; Conclus\u00f5es: O presente estudo evidencia que \na ocorr\u00eancia de E. mactroides na por\u00e7\u00e3o sul da regi\u00e3o estuarina, que depende do regime de \nvaz\u00e3o da laguna, caracteriza os recrutamentos como temporalmente imprevis\u00edveis, e sua \npersist\u00eancia \u00e9 afetada por condi\u00e7\u00f5es desfavor\u00e1veis a seu desenvolvimento como eventos \nde deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos finos.\n\nPalavras-chave: Erodona mactroides, recrutamento, El Ni\u00f1o, estu\u00e1rio, Lagoa dos Patos.\n\n\n\n412 Colling, LA., Bemvenuti, CE. and Pinotti, RM.

The temporal variability \nof E. mactroides densities was tested by Kruskal-\nWallis non-parametric analyses (p = 0.05), since \nnormality and homogeneity of these data were not \nattained, even after several transformations.\n\nRegression analyses were pairwisely executed \nto the monthly means of silt + clay percentages, \nOM contents, fluvial discharge, salinity and water \nlevel, being used for each pair of data the best R2 \nmathematical equation. In order to determine \npossible significant correlations between biological \nand environmental data (Zar, 1984) the Spearman\u2019s \n\u201cR\u201d correlation coefficient (p = 0.05) were used \nto compare the monthly means of E. mactroides \ndensities to the following standardized abiotic data \n(Clarke and Warwick, 1994): silt + clay percentages, \nOM contents, fluvial discharge, salinity and water \nlevel.\n\nTo evaluate the significance of declining in \nthe E. mactroides densities there were performed \nANOVA tests (One-way; p = 0.05) on each pair \nof the following months: August-September 2003, \nApril-May 2004 and October-November 2004, all \nconsidered here as mortality events due to expressive \nreductions in the bivalve densities.\n\nTo quantify the depositional processes that are \nable to interfere in the survival and persistence \nof E.\u00a0 mactroides through time, experiments on \nsediment deposition were fortnightly executed \nutilizing 12 particle interceptor traps. These \nsediment traps were built using an external PVC \npipe (7.5 cm diameter \u00d7 15 cm high) with 10 PVC \ntubes inside of it (1 cm diameter \u00d7 10 cm high) \nfixed on a solid base buried into the substrate. These \ntraps were placed on the sampling site 15 days \nbefore the biological sampling and then removed \nto the laboratory, where the caught sediments were \n\nand evaluate possible mortality events related to \nsubstrate dynamics like fine sediment depositions.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\nLocated at the coastal plain of southern Brazil, \nthe Patos Lagoon is classified as the world\u2019s largest \nchoked lagoon (Kjerfve, 1986). With a surface \narea of 10,227 km2, this coastal lagoon stretches \nin a NE-SW direction from 30\u00ba 30\u2019 S to 32\u00ba\u00a012\u2019 \nS near the city of Rio Grande. Inside its southern \nportion an estuarine region of 971 km\u00b2 is found \n(approximately 10% of the lagoon) which exchanges \nwaters with the Atlantic Ocean through a 20 km \nlong and 0.5-3 km wide inlet. Through tributary \nrivers and the S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo channel (Lagoa \nMirim watershed), this lagoon receives freshwater \nfrom a 201,626 km\u00b2 drainage basin, in which \nhigh precipitation and complex patterns of river \ndischarge result in highly dynamic hydrographic \nprocesses (Asmus, 1997).\n\nThe present study was performed along a 450 m \ntransect of a sheltered shallow plain in the Saco do \nArraial embayment (see map in Colling\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007).\n\nSamples were taken monthly from October \n2002 to December 2004 in an area with 0.8 m mean \ndepth. At each month, sediment samples (n = 6) were \ntaken using a PVC corer (10 cm diameter) buried 10 \ncm into the bottom to analyse granulometric and \norganic matter content (OM). Sand, silt and clay \nproportions were determined according to Suguio \n(1973) through sieving (particles > 0.062 mm) and \npipette analyses (particles &lt;0.062 mm) while OM \ncontents were determined through weight loss by \ncombustion according Davies (1974).\n\nDaily water temperature (\u00baC), salinity and \nwater level (cm) were provided by the Brazilian \nLong-Term Ecological Program databank (PELD \n\u2013 Programas Ecol\u00f3gicos de Longa Dura\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 Site\u00a08 \u2013 \nFURG; www.peld.furg.br). Fluvial discharge data \nfrom the Patos Lagoon main tributary rivers Jacu\u00ed, \nTaquari and Camaqu\u00e3 (Vaz\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006) were taken \ndaily from the Brazilian Waters Agency (ANA \u2013 \nAg\u00eancia Nacional de \u00c1guas; www.ana.gov.br), being \nused here to represent the Patos Lagoon drainage \nbasin monthly runoff mean (sum of Jacu\u00ed, Taquari \nand Camaqu\u00e3 river discharges).\n\nBiologic samples were taken monthly (n = 18) \nusing the same PVC corer used in the sediment \nsamples, being sieved in the field through a \nnylon sieve with 0.3 mm mesh size and then \nfixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution. In the \nlaboratory, E.\u00a0 mactroides individuals were sorted \n\nhttp://www.peld.furg.br\nhttp://www.ana.gov.br\n\n\n2010, vol. 22, no. 4, p. 410-423 Temporal variability of the bivalve Erodona mactroides... 413\n\nwere registered during the winter/02 (previously to \nthe sampling period), along spring/02 and on early \nsummer/03, with fortnightly means not higher than \nfive, except on September 2002. Increasing salinities \nwere observed from later summer/03 (fortnightly \nmeans between 5 and 15) to early summer/04, \nwhen low salinity values were registered, followed \nagain by an increase in salinity from summer/04 to \nwinter/04, period when were registered fortnightly \nmeans often higher than 15.\n\nIt was calculated for the Patos Lagoon estuarine \nregion a decadal mean of water level (MWL) \ncomprising the daily values registered in the PELD \ndatabank between January 1994 and December \n2004, from which it was calculated a MWL equal \nto 48.7 cm. For the spring/02 and summer/03, the \nmean water level registered were 70.0 cm, a value \nhigher than that decadal mean due to the great \nfreshwater discharge (Figure 1c). On the other \nhand, from the spring/03 to spring/04 there were \nregistered water levels between 30 and 50 cm, values \nsignificant lower than those observed in the early \nsampling period (Table 1).\n\nPercentages of fine sediments (silt + clay) as \nwell as the percentages of organic matter in the \nsediment varied significantly among the analyzed \nperiods (Table 1). Higher percentages of silt and clay \n\nweighted (total weigh expressed in g) and their \ngranulometric fractions were determined. These \nexperiments were executed between December 2002 \nand August 2004, except for January, March, June \nand October 2003 and July 2004.\n\n3. Results\n\nHigher water temperatures were registered \nduring summer/03 (25.8 \u00b0C) and summer/04 \n(24.8 \u00b0C) while lower ones were observed during \nwinter/03 (13.6 \u00b0C) and winter/04 (13.1 \u00b0C). The \nwater temperature along spring seasons were always \nwarmer than those registered in autumn seasons.\n\nSignificant differences in the mean freshwater \ndischarge were found among the evaluated periods \n(Table 1; Figure 1a). From spring/02 to summer/03 \nthere were registered the highest values of discharge, \nas observed on October 2002 (5,982 m3/s). After \nthese elevated runoff rates in the begging of the \nstudy, it was observed significant decreasing \ndischarges with the lowest rates being registered \nfrom summer/04 to autumn/04, like those on \nMarch 2004 (about 307 m3/s).\n\nSalinity data showed significant differences \namong seasons (Table 1) and great temporal \nvariability (Figure 1b), ranging from zero (spring/02 \nand summer/03) to 35 (autumn/04).

The second period \nwas characterized by a decreasing influence of the \nEl Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, predominance of mixohaline \nwaters, lower percentages of fine sediments and \nhigher percentages of organic matter.\n\nThe Patos Lagoon presents low tidal amplitude \nand salinity variations strongly influenced by the \naction of winds (seasonal scale) and hydrological \ncycles on its drainage basin (interannual scale), in \nwhich the predominance of freshwaters inside the \nestuarine region are associated to NE winds and \nelevated fluvial discharge; on the other hand, the \npredominance of marine waters inside the estuary \nare found to be related to S winds and droughts on \n\nfor the substrate an increase on its fine sediment \nrates (Figure 2), ranging from 1.98% on August to \n4.75% on September 2003.\n\nIn the second mortality event (April-May 2004) \nthe weight of deposited silt + clay fractions raised \nfrom 40.54 g on April to 59.08 g on May, with \nfine sediment percentages increasing from 39.37\u00a0to \n67.39% (Figure 8).

Likewise, the period \nbetween later autumn/02 and later summer/03 was \nagain influenced by this phenomenon (NOAA, \n2006), with consequent maintenance of freshwater \ninside the estuarine region until the end of \nsummer/03, as well as a mean water level higher \nthan the decadal mean (Cap\u00edtoli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008).\n\nHigh rates of pluviometric precipitation in the \nPatos Lagoon are responsible for a considerable \ntransport of silt and clay towards the estuarine \n\nthe drainage basin of this lagoon (Niencheski and \nBaumgarten, 1997).\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon can be considered as \nthe main source of great pluviometric events at the \nSouth America (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; \nGrimm\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2000), increasing the precipitation \nrates in southern Brazil during the spring seasons and \nintensifying rains from May to July. As a consequence \nto the hydrographic regime inside the Patos Lagoon, \nthe continental discharge rather exceeds its mean \nvalues (Garcia, 1997) and the water level presents \na pronounced positive anomaly (Costa\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; \nColling\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007).

Changes in the \nictiofaunal structure were found inside the Patos \nLagoon southern portion as a consequence of the \nlower salinity caused by the ENSO phenomenon, \nbeing registered species from limnetic regions and \nreductions on marine and estuarine species\u2019 richness \n(Garcia\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001).\n\nLate recruitments in the macrobenthic fauna, \nwhich occurred only on later summer/03 and \nearly autumn/03 in the Patos Lagoon estuary, \nevidenced that environmental changes like those \non salinity, hydrodynamics and in the bottom \nsediments are able to influence the variability of \n\nregion, which come from many sources within the \nextensive Patos-Mirim drainage basin (Calliari, \n1997). In the present work, higher percentages of \nfine sediments were registered in the same periods \nthat there were observed limnetic conditions inside \nthe southern portion of the lagoon, reinforcing \n\na b\n\nc d\n\ne\n\nFigure 6.

Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\nfor the recruitments observed at the southern shoals \n(Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), in which the success \nof the bivalve recruitments is found to be related \nto the hydrologic conditions (Bemvenuti\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n1978, 1992).\n\nThe larval settlement registered in the present \nstudy occurred simultaneously to the environmental \nchanges on later summer/03-autumn/03, when \nthere were registered increments in the salinity \nvalues and decreasing percentages of fine sediments \ninto the substrate. Taking into account that the \nrecruitments of E. mactroides generally occur on \nspring and summer seasons, post-settled juveniles \ncould have been experienced several displacements \ncaused by the intense freshwater discharge in this \nperiod.\n\nThese post-settled individuals could also have \nbeen subjected to mortality events after settlement \ndue to the El Ni\u00f1o harsh conditions, like high \nwater discharges and elevated percentages of fine \nsediments. These mortality events at the initial life \nstages of the bivalves are not easy to detect due to \ntheir small body size and the absence of a calcified \nshell, characteristics that difficult their conventional \nsampling and accelerate their decomposition.\n\nGreater densities of E. mactroides were found \nduring autumn-winter/03 due to recruitments \nand consequent development of their initial life \nstages. From winter/03 throughout the study, there \nwere observed successive reductions in the species \ndensities, suggesting the existence of conditions \nthat do not afford the persistence in time of these \npopulations inside the estuarine region.\n\nIn a spatial-temporal evaluation concerning \nE.\u00a0mactroides in Laguna Rocha (coastal region from \nUruguay), it was found that the species is adapted \n\nthe macrobenthic assemblages at the shoals inside \nthis lagoon (Colling\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). The influence of \nthe El Ni\u00f1o anomaly was also evaluated by a long-\nterm study concerning the temporal variability of \nthe macrofauna from Port Curtis estuarine region \n(Australia), where there were registered negative \nconsequences to the macrozoobenthic communities \ndue to the increase of freshwater inflow towards the \nestuary (Currie and Small, 2005), as well as observed \nto the Tamar Estuary, England (Bale\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006).\n\nThe beginning of E. mactroides recruitments \nwere observed on later summer/03, being the first \norganisms found on February 2003, the same period \nin which it was registered the lower influence of the \nEl Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, with increasing salinity and \nOM contents; and decreasing discharges, water \nlevel rates and fine sediments percentages. New \nrecruitments (by the input of juvenile organisms) \nwere not observed until the end of this study.\n\nThrough sur veys on distribution of the \nmacrobenthic fauna inside the Patos Lagoon, it was \nobserved a wide spatial distribution of E.\u00a0mactroides \nalong the whole lagoon area and inside its southern \nestuarine region (Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998). This \nbivalve species occupies great areas in its oligohaline \nnorthern portion, where there were found at all the \nsize classes, high density of adults (reproductive \nstock) and elevated biomass due to the large size of \nthe individuals. On the other hand, only juvenile \nbivalves younger than one year old are registered \nin the southern portion, in which the species \nrecruitment is considered potentially unsuccessful \n(Bemvenuti\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1978).\n\nFollowing the freshwater discharge during the \nspring-summer periods, the larvae of E. mactroides \nthat come from the northern region are responsible \n\nFigure 8. Silt + clay sediment percentages (green bars) and total sediment weight (black lines) monthly registered in \nthe experiments on sediment deposition.\n\n\n\n2010, vol. 22, no. 4, p. 410-423 Temporal variability of the bivalve Erodona mactroides... 421\n\nInstability at the bottom\u2019s surface can also be \na cause of stress to suspension feeder bivalves due \nto post-settled larvae ressuspension, burying and/\nor recruitment suppression (Rhoads and Young, \n1970). Moreover, suspension feeder organisms \nare sensible to intense silt and clay depositions, \npresenting then severe mortality (Levinton, 1995). \nIn this sense, short-siphon bivalves like E. mactroides \nare also susceptible to massive mortalities due \nto the clogging of their filter-feeding apparatus, \nlike previously observed for the bivalve Rangia \ncuneata Sowerby, 1831 (Peddicord, 1977). Field \nexperiments on adults of R. cuneata have shown \nthat mortality was higher and growth was slower \nfor those individuals on fine sediments than for \nthose growing on sandy substrate (Tenore, 1968). \nFurthermore, the growth of R. cuneata adults was \nfaster in clams placed in sand than those in mud \n(Peddicord, 1976), evidencing a great recruitment \nsuccess associated to coarse sediments.\n\nThis work showed that the input of juveniles \ninto the southern estuary, which depends of \nthe discharge regime from its upper portion, \ncharacterizes the recruitments of E. mactroides as \ntemporally unpredictable southwards. The present \nevaluation concerning the interactions between \nthe species temporal variability and the hydrologic \ncharacteristics of the estuarine region give support \nto understand the dynamic from one of the \nmajor macrobenthic components, evidencing the \nspecies relationship to small-scale environmental \nparameters and global events of low predictability \nlike El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. Moreover, mortality \nevents and substrate dynamics were found to be \nlinked, evidencing that fine deposition processes can \ninterfere in the recruitment success and temporal \npersistence of E. mactroides at shoals inside estuarine \nregions.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTo Nilton Ara\u00fajo de Abreu for his valuable \nfield effort, to Lauro Barcellos for the support \nfrom MOFURG (Museu Oceanogr\u00e1fico da \nUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande) and also to \nCNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento \nCient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico) for the financial support.\n\nReferences\n\nALLEN, GP., SALOMON, JC., BASSOULET, P., Du \nPENHOAT, Y. and De GRANDPR\u00c9, C. 1980. \nEffects of tides on mixing and suspended sediment \ntransport in macrotidal estuaries. Sedimentary Geology, \n\nto the continuous changes in such system, being \nfavored by the open/close regimes of a sandy bar \nthat separates the lagoon from the adjacent marine \nenvironment. Furthermore, the adaptability of this \nbivalve to colonize mixohaline environments, in \nwhich salinity values range from near zero to 20, \nsuggests that salinity in Laguna Rocha apparently \ndo not interfere in the spatial distribution of this \nspecies (Jorcin, 1996).\n\nIn estuarine environments, the suspended \nmatter experience depositional processes due to the \nreduction in the flux velocity and flocculation of \nparticles when in contact to salty waters (Postma, \n1980; Niencheski and Windom, 1994). Regular \ndeposition and ressuspension of fine sediments are \nable to result in fluid mud deposits (Allen\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n1980), determining dynamic events on the shallow \nestuarine bottoms that can directly interfere in the \ndevelopment of macrobenthic species (Ysebaert \nand Herman, 2002; Teske and Wooldridge, 2003; \nThrush\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2003) and sub-superficial bivalves \nlike E. mactroides. Mortality events were previously \nobserved in the Patos Lagoon estuarine shoals after \nE. mactroides recruitments (Bemvenuti\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1978; \nBemvenuti and Netto, 1998), being suggested the \nrelationship between mortality and deposition of \nfine sediments at shallow embayments (Bemvenuti, \n1997a), besides not quantified. The mortality events \nregistered in the present work on August-September \n2003, April-May 2004 and October-November \n2004 evidenced the occurrence of adverse conditions \nto the species development at the shoals in the \nsouthern estuarine portion. Simultaneously to the \nmortality events, the quantification of depositional \nevents evidenced that the input of fine sediments \n(silt + clay) in the substrate interferes negatively on \nthe bivalves\u2019 survival.\n\nThe winter/03 was also marked by a pronounced \nsalinity variation inside the estuarine region, \nwith fortnightly means ranging from near zero \nto 10\u00a0 during short periods. Periods of freshwater \ndischarge associated with marine water inflows \ninduced by S winds cause a vertical stratification \nwhich results in a saltwedge formation (Niencheski \nand Baumgarten, 1997). Furthermore, the \ninteractions between the geomorphologic features \nof the estuary in its southern portion and the \npenetration of marine water during strong S winds, \ncan both favor the ressuspension of fine sediments \ndeposited inside the estuarine area (Niencheski \nand Windom, 1994; Niencheski and Baumgarten, \n1997).\n\n\n\n422 Colling, LA., Bemvenuti, CE. and Pinotti, RM.
