I have drawn inspiration and ideas from \n\nmany people through the years. I would like to acknowledge individually to each person, but \n\nunfortunately, a few pages would not be enough.   \n\n \n\nI would like to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Rui Reis, for all the opportunities that he gave \n\nme. Looking back, after all these years, I can say that he was my best professor. It is because of \n\nhis classes I chose his lab to do my internship. His enthusiasm, motivation, dynamism, youth, and \n\nstrategy influenced my decision to join the 3B\u00b4s Research Group a few years ago. He always \n\nbelieved in me more than I did. I also thank his support and the opportunity to spend almost one \n\nyear and half abroad without an FCT grant. He also gave me the opportunity to present my work \n\nand participate in the best conferences of the field and always gave me the necessary freedom to \n\nguide my research and to explore my ideas. \n\n \n\nDuring my visits to Rice University, USA, Professor Mikos accepted to supervise my work and \n\nalways made all the efforts to make my life there pleasant. I would like to express my sincere \n\nthanks for his help and crucial guidance. The thoughtful discussions and meetings will be never \n\nforgotten. These several visits had a remarkable input in my research work and allowed me to \n\ngrow as a scientist. I deeply enjoyed working in Mikos lab. The courteousness and friendly \n\nenvironment of the Mikos lab was extremely appreciated. The time that I spent at Rice University \n\nwas the happiest days of my professional life. And I really loved the extremely warm weather of \n\nHouston. \n\nI want also to thank Kurt Kasper who helped me in the preparation of protocols and the in vivo \n\nsurgeries. His pertinent suggestions, availability and support revising the manuscripts significantly \n\nincrease their quality. \n\nTo my colleagues and friends at Mikos lab who helped me to feel at home and taught me so \n\nmany things that I needed to know. My several periods abroad were great and successful mainly \n\nbecause of you. I want to deeply acknowledge all their attention and friendship, but also for \n\nholding me up through difficulties mainly when I felt sick and during the Ike hurricane that I was \n\nwithout power energy at home for 3 weeks. I will never forget what you did for me in the more \n\nadverse times.   \n\n \n\nTo my co-advisor and friend Catarina who taught me so much. Your contribution in my life is \n\nbeyond words. I learned how to plan everything in detail and to be organized. Our fruitful \n\ndiscussions and scientific plans have been memorable. I am tremendously grateful for your belief \n\nin me even when I had so many doubts. You are an example of strength and courage. I deeply \n\nacknowledge your optimism and confidence. You will never know how important you were in \n\ncertain moments of my life. I cannot quantify how many hours we spent together (when we were \n\n\n\nii \n\nboth in Portugal) or on the phone. We never had a schedule. You always had time!!! I will never \n\nforget our endless discussions, \u201cblood sessions\u201d, washing hands with EtOH (always!!!), and how \n\ngood Technovit is!!! \n\n \n\nAna M.

I must say that I have many special \n\npeople around me. But a special word is addressed to Ana Rita and Rui Pereira. My dearest Ana \n\nRita needs to read how important she has been in my life. They have been through these years\u2019 \n\nunimaginable friends. We have been together in the wonderful and bad times. They have been \n\nvery special friends and they share with me the same values. Thank you for your patience (in this \n\nlast months I almost did not have social life), true opinion, and loyalty. Our friendship is a proof \n\nthat the distance means nothing. Thank you so much my compagnons de route.  \n\n \n\nTo my twin brother, my mother, and my father, this thesis is dedicated to you. I am everything I \n\nam because I have you. You always have been supporting my dreams, choices, and decisions. \n\nThis thesis would not exist without you.

I was always awake for your each 2 hours meal.  \n\n \n\n\n\niii \n\nStimulus Responsive Smart Supports and Scaffold/Cell Constructs for Bone \n\nTissue Engineering \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nTissue engineering (TE) has emerged as a new interdisciplinary science for the repair of various \n\ntissues, restoring their functions by means of using biomaterials, cells, and/or bioactive factors. Three \n\nmain general strategies have been adopted for the creation of new bone tissue: i) direct in vivo \n\nimplantation of isolated cells; ii) direct in vivo implantation of scaffolds; and iii) cells placed on or within \n\nscaffolds. In the bone tissue engineering approach, a temporary scaffold is required to serve as an \n\nadhesive substrate for the implanted cells and a physical support to guide the formation of the new \n\ntissue. In the second and third approaches, a porous material acts as a scaffold, serving in the later \n\ncase as transplant vehicle for cultured cells and template to guide tissue regeneration, playing an \n\nimportant role in transforming the cell seeded scaffolds in to a new tissue. \n\nThe present thesis is divided in two main groups of studies: in the first one we describe the TE \n\nstrategy of using scaffold and seeded cells with osteogenic media supplemented with several \n\nenzymes (Chapter III and IV). The second part describes the development of acellular scaffolds with in \n\nsitu pore forming ability in vitro, improvement of their properties (namely degradation and \n\nosteoconductivity) and finally the validation of in situ pore forming concept in vivo (Chapters V, VI, VII \n\nand VIII).  \n\nPreviously, it was demonstrated that starch/poly(?-caprolactone) fiber mesh scaffolds have induced \n\nosteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) when cultured in flow perfusion \n\nbioreactors. The studies described in Chapters III and IV aimed to investigate the effect of complete \n\nosteogenic media supplemented with different enzymes in physiological concentrations similar to \n\nthose found in human serum. The influence of these enzymes on the degradation of SPCL fiber \n\nmeshes and on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs seeded onto scaffolds was assessed. These \n\nstudies were performed in static cultures and in flow perfusion bioreactors. After degradation studies in \n\nstatic and dynamic conditions in the presence of enzymes showed that SPCL did not lose its structural \n\nintegrity. ?-amylase had a remarkable effect on the degradation, increasing porosity and pore size of \n\nSPCL in both static and dynamic conditions. It was demonstrated that supplementation of culture \n\nmedia with lipase enhances the osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix \n\nmineralization in static cultures. When flow perfusion bioreactors were used, the flow enhanced the \n\ninfiltration of cells and facilitated better distribution of extracellular matrix throughout the scaffolds in \n\nthe presence/absence of enzymes. The presence of flow and lipase improved the osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of MSCs as compared with the other groups, enhanced mineralization and promoted \n\nuniform matrix distribution. \n\nThe second part of this thesis (Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII) described the development of almost non-\n\nporous chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds, with the ability of forming a porous structure in situ due \n\nto the attack by specific enzymes present in the human body (?-amylase and lysozyme). The results \n\nof the compressive tests showed that these scaffolds exhibit very good mechanical properties in both \n\nthe dry and wet state. Degradation studies were performed using ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at \n\n\n\niv \n\nconcentrations similar to those found in human serum and showed that after enzymatic degradation \n\nthere was the formation of a porous structure, indicating the potential of this methodology to obtain in \n\nsitu forming scaffolds. Citotoxicity test revealed that the extracts of the materials were clearly non-toxic \n\nto L929 fibroblast cells. Analysis of cell adhesion and morphology of seeded osteoblastic-like cells in \n\ndirect contact tests showed that the number of cells on chitosan/starch scaffolds was noticeably higher \n\nthan that on chitosan scaffolds, which suggest that starch containing materials may promote cell \n\nadhesion and proliferation. \n\nIn order to improve the in situ pore forming scaffolds, a self-regulated degrading material with gradual \n\nin situ pore formation were developed. This approach is based on the incorporation of the lysozyme \n\nenzyme into biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings. These coatings were prepared on the \n\nsurface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling \n\ntheir degradation rate and preventing infection upon implantation. Two different environments were \n\nsimulated: normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and inflammatory response (pH 5). At pH 7.4, the \n\nscaffolds remained more stable than those incubated at pH 5, which showed a rapid decrease in their \n\ninitial weight and the formation of a highly porous structure.  \n\nAdditional studies investigated the influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on osteogenic differentiation \n\nof rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat MSCs seeded on the \n\nCaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated. At all culture times, CaP coated \n\nchitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, \n\nbone matrix production, and mineralization. The ability of these CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds \n\nwith incorporated lysozyme to create an interconnected pore network in situ coupled with its positive \n\neffect on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and the production of mineralized matrix illustrate the \n\nstrong potential of these scaffolds for application in bone tissue engineering strategies. \n\nIn order to validate the concept in vivo, a rat subcutaneous model was used to investigate the \n\ndegradation of the scaffolds and the in situ pore formation. All scaffolds showed pronounced weight \n\nloss and pore formation as a function of time. All group conditions showed a significant increase in \n\nporosity after 12 weeks. After all time points no adverse tissue reaction was observed, and as \n\ndegradation increased, histological analysis showed cells ingrowth throughout the implants. Using this \n\ninnovative methodology, the ability of gradual in situ pore formation of these novel scaffolds was \n\ndemonstrated in vivo.  \n\nAs a concluding remark, it can be stated that the studies performed in this thesis proposed several \n\nsuccessful strategies that might find application in a bone tissue engineering scenario. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nv \n\nSuportes Inteligentes com Capacidade de Responder a Est\u00edmulos e Novas \n\nCombina\u00e7\u00f5es Suportes/C\u00e9lulas para Engenharia de Tecidos \u00d3sseos \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA Engenharia de Tecidos \u00e9 uma ci\u00eancia interdisciplinar recente que visa reparar diferentes tecidos, \n\nrecuperando as suas fun\u00e7\u00f5es usando biomateriais, c\u00e9lulas e/ou agentes bioactivos. As tr\u00eas \n\nestrat\u00e9gias que t\u00eam sido usadas para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de novo tecido \u00f3sseo incluem: i) implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nc\u00e9lulas; ii) implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes tridimensionais; e iii) combina\u00e7\u00e3o das duas estrat\u00e9gias anteriores, \n\nusando c\u00e9lulas cultivadas nos suportes. Na engenharia de tecidos \u00f3sseos, os suportes s\u00e3o usados \n\ncomo substrato para c\u00e9lulas e tamb\u00e9m como suporte f\u00edsico para as mesmas de forma a induzir a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de novo tecido \u00f3sseo. Na segunda e terceira estrat\u00e9gias, descritas anteriormente, um \n\nmaterial poroso funciona como suporte para cultura de c\u00e9lulas e para induzir a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea, \n\ntendo um papel importante na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas no tecido desejado. \n\nEsta tese divide-se em dois estudos principais: o primeiro que descreve a estrat\u00e9gia de engenharia \n\nde tecidos utilizando um suporte poroso e c\u00e9lulas cultivadas no mesmo, usando meio osteog\u00e9nico \n\nenriquecido com diferentes enzimas (Cap\u00edtulos III e IV). A segunda parte desta tese descreve o \n\ndesenvolvimento de suportes n\u00e3o porosos com a capacidade de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros in situ, \n\naperfei\u00e7oamento das suas propriedades (nomeadamente no que respeita a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nosteoconductividade) e por \u00faltimo, a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o do conceito de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros in situ nos \n\nsuportes inteligentes quando implantados in vivo (Cap\u00edtulos V, VI, VII e VIII). \n\nOs estudos apresentados nos Cap\u00edtulos IIII e IV tiveram como objectivo investigar o efeito do meio \n\nosteog\u00e9nico enriquecido com diferentes enzimas em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas semelhantes \u00e0s \n\nencontradas no soro humano. Estudou-se a influ\u00eancia destas enzimas na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de suportes \n\nporosos \u00e0 base de amido e policaprolactona (SPCL) e na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica de c\u00e9lulas da \n\nmedula \u00f3ssea de rato. Estes estudos foram efectuados em condi\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1ticas e usando bioreactores \n\nde perfus\u00e3o. Os estudos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1ticas e din\u00e2micas mostraram que na \n\npresen\u00e7a das enzimas, os suportes de SPCL n\u00e3o perderam a sua estrutura f\u00edsica. A ?-amilase teve \n\num efeito significativo na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos suportes de SPCL, aumentando a sua porosidade e o \n\ntamanho de poros em condi\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1ticas e din\u00e2micas. Demonstrou-se tamb\u00e9m que a lipase no meio \n\nosteog\u00e9nico melhorou a diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica das c\u00e9lulas cultivadas nos suportes de SPCL e \n\nestimulou a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz extracelular em condi\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1ticas. Quando foram usados \n\nbioreactores de perfus\u00e3o, verificou-se que o fluxo melhorou a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas e permitiu uma \n\nmelhor distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de matriz extracelular no interior dos suportes. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o do fluxo (gerado \n\npelos bioreactores) e a presen\u00e7a de lipase permitiram obter melhores resultados no que respeita a \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica das c\u00e9lulas da medula \u00f3ssea em todos os grupos estudados, induzindo \n\nmais mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz extracelular. \n\nA segunda parte desta tese (Cap\u00edtulos V, VI, VII and VIII) descreve o desenvolvimento de suportes \n\nn\u00e3o porosos \u00e0 base de quitosano e combina\u00e7\u00e3o de quitosano com amido, com a capacidade de \n\nformarem uma estrutura porosa in situ devido \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas espec\u00edficas (?-amilase e lisozima \u2013 \n\nenzimas existentes no corpo humano). Os resultados dos estudos de compress\u00e3o mostraram que \n\n\n\nvi \n\nestes suportes t\u00eam propriedades mec\u00e2nicas adequadas quando estudados nos estados seco e \n\nmolhado.  \n\nOs estudos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o foram efectuados usando ?-amilase e/ou lisozima em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nsemelhantes \u00e0s encontradas no soro humano e mostraram que induziram a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma \n\nestrutura porosa, demonstrando o potencial destes suportes inteligentes com capacidade para \n\nresponder a est\u00edmulos. Os testes de citotoxicidade com fibroblastos L929 mostraram a aus\u00eancia de \n\ntoxicidade dos extractos dos materiais. Os testes de contacto directo com uma linha celular de \n\nosteoblastos mostraram que o n\u00famero de c\u00e9lulas nos suportes \u00e0 base de quitosano e amido era \n\nmaior do que nos suportes de quitosano, sugerindo que o amido pode promover a ades\u00e3o e \n\nprolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular. \n\nDesenvolveram-se suportes inteligentes com capacidade de responder a est\u00edmulos de forma a \n\nmelhorar o comportamento dos suportes com capacidade de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros in situ. Esta \n\nestrat\u00e9gia incluiu a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de lisozima em revestimentos de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio na superf\u00edcie de \n\nsuportes de quitosano usando a t\u00e9cnica de revestimentos biomim\u00e9ticos com o objectivo de controlar a \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos suportes e prevenir infec\u00e7\u00f5es. Foram simuladas duas condi\u00e7\u00f5es: condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nfisiol\u00f3gicas normais (pH 7.4) e de resposta inflamat\u00f3ria (pH 5). A pH 7.4, os suportes mantiveram-se \n\nest\u00e1veis comparativamente aos estudados a pH 5, que mostraram um decr\u00e9scimo de peso e a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas porosas. \n\nEstudos adicionais investigaram a influ\u00eancia dos revestimentos de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nosteog\u00e9nica de c\u00e9lulas da medula \u00f3ssea e mostraram que estas diferenciaram-se na presen\u00e7a de \n\nlisozima. Em todos os tempos de cultura observou-se que os suportes de quitosano revestidos com \n\nfosfatos de c\u00e1lcio e na presen\u00e7a de lisozima tiveram um melhor comportamento do que os restantes \n\ngrupos estudados, nomeadamente na produ\u00e7\u00e3o e mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz extracelular. A capacidade \n\ndestes suportes inteligentes em responder a est\u00edmulos e formar estruturas porosas, juntamente com o \n\nefeito positivo na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica de c\u00e9lulas da medula \u00f3ssea, ilustram o potencial destes \n\nsuportes para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es na \u00e1rea de engenharia de tecidos \u00f3sseos. \n\nPor \u00faltimo, pretendeu-se confirmar o conceito de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros in vivo. Diferentes tipos de \n\nsuportes \u00e0 base de quitosano e amido, revestidos ou n\u00e3o com fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio e na \n\npresen\u00e7a/aus\u00eancia de lisozima foram implantados em ratos usando um modelo subcut\u00e2neo. Os \n\nprincipais objectivos inclu\u00edram o estudo da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o in vivo dos suportes e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros in \n\nsitu. Todos os suportes apresentaram elevada perda de peso e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ntempo de implanta\u00e7\u00e3o.

Martins was born on May 21, 1979, in Braga, Portugal. She is currently a PhD \n\ncandidate at the 3B\u2019s Research Group (Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics), \n\nUniversity of Minho, Portugal. Her doctoral work has been supervised by Prof. Rui L. Reis \n\n(also the Director of 3B\u2019s Research Group), Dr. Catarina Alves (Post-Doctoral Research \n\nFellow at the 3B\u00b4s Research Group and Harvard University), and Prof. Antonios G. Mikos \n\n(Director of John W. Cox Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering and of the Center for \n\nExcellence in Tissue Engineering) from the Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, \n\nUSA. She has just submitted her PhD thesis on Biomedical Engineering to the University of \n\nMinho, which was prepared in cooperation with Rice University, Houston, USA.  \n\nAna Martins received her Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Biology from the \n\nUniversity of Minho in 2004. As her senior research project she spent one year at the 3B\u00b4s \n\nResearch Group under the supervision of Prof. Rui L. Reis, with her project graded with 19 \n\n(0-20 scale). In 2006, she also completed a Post-graduation Course on Processing and \n\nCharacterization of Materials (first year of the Masters in Processing and Characterization \n\nof Materials), University of Minho, Portugal, with a final score of 15 (0-20 scale). \n\nIn April 2006, she formally started her PhD at the 3B\u2019s Research Group where she has \n\nbeen working on the development, characterization and modification with biomimetic \n\ncoatings of novel scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. At the same time she received a \n\nscholarship for her doctoral research studies from the European Network of Excellence, \n\nEXPERTISSUES, which enabled her to perform her studies at Rice University, USA. \n\nDuring her PhD work she spent several periods in a total of almost one year and half at \n\nRice University, under the supervision of Prof. Antonios G. Mikos. She was also mentor of \n\nan undergraduate student (Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering) at Rice University. \n\nAdditionally, at Rice University she learned and mastered procedures associated with the \n\noperation of a novel flow perfusion bioreactor system, she has acquired a firm foundation of \n\nknowledge and experience in the harvest and expansion of bone marrow stromal cells from \n\nrats and in the subcutaneous implantation of tissue engineering constructs in a rat animal \n\nmodel. Indeed, apart from knowledge and experience in progenitor cell biology, advanced \n\ncell culture techniques and animal models, Ana Martins has acquired training in natural \n\nbased materials, enzymes and their biomedical applications through her research activities \n\nat the 3B\u2019s Research Group at the University of Minho in Portugal.  \n\n \n\nAna M. Martins has been also involved in the writing and preparation of several grant \n\nproposals, both at National (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) and \n\nEuropean levels (Framework Programme VI). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxxx \n\nAs a result of her research she attended the most important international conferences in \n\nthe field of Biomaterials, Tissue Engineering, and Regenerative Medicine. Presently, she is \n\nthe first author of 7 papers in international refereed journals (2 published, 3 in press, and 3 \n\nsubmitted) and 1 book chapter (in press). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxxxi \n\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS \n\nThe work performed during this PhD studies resulted in the following publications: \n\n \n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL WITH REFEREE \n\nA.M.

The contents of each section are summarized below. \n\n \n\nSECTION 1 (Chapter I) \n\nIn the first part (Part I) it is discussed the preparation of naturally derived scaffolds of \n\npolysaccharide origin, the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells cultured on \n\nbiomimetic calcium phosphate coatings, and the delivery of biomolecules associated with \n\nECM mineralization. The second part (Part II) gives an overview of strategies that can \n\nmodulate bone tissue regeneration by using naturally derived in situ-forming scaffolds. \n\n \n\nSECTION 2 (Chapter II) \n\nChapter II contains the materials and experimental procedures used within the scope of \n\nthis thesis, detailing what is included in the manuscripts that compose the results sections. \n\n \n\nSECTION 3 (Chapter III and IV) consists of two chapters of experimental work. \n\nChapters III and IV describes the studies using starch/ poly(?-caprolactone) fiber mesh \n\nscaffolds and osteogenic culture media supplemented with ?-amylase and/or lipase in static \n\ncultures and flow perfusion bioreactors using rat bone marrow stromal cells. Degradation \n\nstudies with ?-amylase or lipase were also performed in static and dynamic conditions. \n\n \n\nSECTION 4 (Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII) consists of four chapters of experimental \n\nwork. \n\nChapter V describes the development of several scaffolds formulations based on chitosan \n\nand starch with the ability of forming a porous structure in situ due to the attack of specific \n\nenzymes present in the human body (?-amylase and lysozyme). Compressive analysis, \n\ndegradation studies with ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at concentrations similar to those \n\nfound in human serum, extracts tests with L929 cells and direct contact tests with \n\nosteoblast-like cells were performed. \n\n \n\nChapter VI describes an innovative self-regulated degrading material with gradual in situ \n\npore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications. In this work, lysozyme was \n\nincorporated into calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, on the surface of chitosan scaffolds \n\nusing biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling their degradation rate, \n\nsubsequent formation of pores and to prevent infection upon implantation. To prove the \n\nconcept of in situ pore formation, the coated scaffolds (with and without lysozyme) were \n\nincubated in two different solutions at different pHs to simulate normal physiological \n\nconditions (pH 7.4) and inflammatory response (pH 5).  \n\n\n\n \n\nxxxvi \n\n \n\nChapter VII reports the use of CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated \n\nlysozyme. This study was designed in order to assess the influence of lysozyme on the \n\nformation of pores in chitosan scaffolds, using a similar concentration to the one \n\nincorporated into CaP coatings. Additional studies investigated the influence of a CaP \n\nbiomimetic coating and lysozyme on osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nChapter VIII presents the final experimental study performed for this thesis. This last study \n\nintends to validate the concept of in situ pore forming in vivo using a rat subcutaneous \n\nmodel. It was investigated the degradation of the scaffolds in vivo and the in situ formation \n\nof pores. \n\n \n\nSECTION 5 (Chapter IX)  \n\nChapter IX contains the general conclusions and final remarks regarding the overall work \n\ncarried out under the scope of this thesis. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION 1\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nPART I.  \n\nTowards Osteogenic Differentiation of Marrow Stromal Cells and In Vitro \n\nProduction of Mineralized Extracellular Matrix onto Natural Based Scaffolds \n\n \n\nPART II. \n\nNaturally Derived Responsive and In Situ-Forming Scaffolds for Bone Tissue \n\nEngineering Applications: An Overview of the Last Decade \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

INTRODUCTION \n\nBone is a dynamic, highly vascularized tissue with a unique capacity to heal and \n\nremodel without leaving a scar. It is the structural framework of the body and is composed of \n\nan inorganic mineral phase of hydroxyapatite and an organic phase of mainly type I collagen. \n\nBone continuously resorbs and reforms in a remodeling process that is carried out by two \n\ntypes of bone cells: the bone-building osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Slowly \n\nand insidiously, bone deteriorates, losing minerals and structure. Bone injuries produced as a \n\nresult of disease and/or trauma present a major health concern. A fracture, usually of the hip, \n\nwrist, or a vertebra, is often the first indication that osteoporosis has been weakening the \n\nbones of a patient for years (1). Treatment options include transplantation, surgical repair, \n\nprostheses, mechanical devices, and drug therapy (2). However, major damage to a tissue \n\nor organ can neither be repaired nor long-term recovery effected in a truly satisfactory way \n\nusing these methods.  \n\nIn this context, an emerging field of science termed \u201ctissue engineering,\u201d defined as \n\nan \u201cinterdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward \n\nthe development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function\u201d \n\n(3) has been gaining significant recognition. Tissue engineering uses organ-specific cells for \n\nseeding a scaffold ex vivo, however it may also involve the implantation of an acellular \n\nconstruct for guided tissue regeneration (4).  Indeed, a wide range of strategies exist for \n\ntissue engineering in general, and bone tissue engineering specifically.  \n\nBone tissue engineering is a rapidly expanding field, full of innovative ideas for \n\ntreating bone trauma and pathologies. Selection of the most appropriate material to produce \n\na scaffold in bone related applications is a very important step toward the construction of a \n\ntissue engineered construct. There is an increasing interest in the production of novel \n\nscaffolds from renewable resources. Natural polymers are an attractive alternative to \n\nsynthetic polymers for various clinical applications partly due to their biocompatibility and \n\nalso because they are typically biodegraded by \u201cnormal\u201d and/or enzymatic hydrolysis (carried \n\nout, in the majority of cases, by specific enzymes also present in the human body). Some of \n\nthe advantages associated with naturally derived biomaterials are their cost effectiveness as \n\nwell as the wide range of properties and structures attainable with these materials. A large \n\nnumber of different naturally derived biomaterials have been studied and proposed for bone \n\ntissue engineering applications, namely polysaccharides (chitosan, starch, alginate, \n\nhyaluronic acid, and cellulose, among others) and proteins (soy, collagen, fibrin). \n\nPolysaccharides, in particular, have some attractive properties, such as nontoxicity (pertinent \n\nmonomer residues are not hazardous to health), high swelling ability and stability over a \n\nrange of pH values.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n7 \n\nFor successful bone replacement, the ideal scaffold should be biocompatible (5-8) \n\nwith the surrounding biological fluids and tissues to avoid any detrimental tissue response. \n\nThe scaffolding material should degrade into nontoxic residues that can be easily removed \n\nfrom the body through normal excretion processes (5, 6, 8, 9). The scaffolds serve as \n\ntemporary substrates for living cells as well as physical supports for tissue regeneration (10). \n\nAdequate surface area and appropriate surface energy are also needed to permit cell \n\nadhesion, promote cell proliferation, and allow retention of differentiated cell functions (5-8, \n\n10). In addition, sufficient mechanical stability of the scaffold is necessary to maintain the \n\ndesired shape and structure during cell culture in vitro and transplantation in vivo. Control of \n\nscaffold pore morphology is critical for controlling cell colonization rates and maintaining \n\ntransport of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste, as well as for supporting organization of \n\nthe engineered tissue. Furthermore, angiogenesis, a requirement for survival and success of \n\nvascularized tissues, can be affected by the porosity of the scaffold. Pore morphology can \n\nalso be expected to significantly affect scaffold degradation kinetics and the mechanical \n\nproperties of the developing tissue (6, 11). \n\nThe scaffolds used for tissue engineering purposes mimic the extracellular matrix \n\n(ECM) of the regenerating bone environment. Thus, in addition to serving as a mechanical \n\nsupport, a tissue engineering scaffold may also be \u201cinformative\u201d to the cells. An ideal three-\n\ndimensional construct for bone tissue engineering, above all discussed pertinent \n\ncharacteristics, should be simultaneously osteoinductive (capable of recruiting \n\nosteoprogenitor cells and stimulating their differentiation down the bone-forming cell lineage), \n\nosteoconductive (capable of supporting the formation of bone at the surface of the scaffold), \n\nand also resorbable and amenable to gradual replacement by newly formed bone (12). In the \n\nmedical field, consideration of biodegradation is a priority on the list of safety standards when \n\nchoosing polymers as potential biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. Naturally \n\nderived materials have recently gained interest, as they are structurally similar to the native \n\nextracellular matrix of many tissues; exhibit excellent biocompatibility; and induce minimal \n\ninflammatory response and tissue damage. Natural polymers may present a biologically \n\nactive environment to the cells, since they usually contain domains that provide cues and can \n\nsend important signals to guide cells at various stages of development (10). \n\nA method to potentially increase the biological activity of a bone tissue engineering \n\nscaffold is to coat the surface of the scaffold with calcium phosphate.  One of the main goals \n\nof calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings on bone tissue engineering scaffolds is to promote \n\nosteoconduction and by enhancing adhesion of osteogenic cells and ingrowth of bone into \n\nbiomaterials (13). New technologies have been developed to promote osteogenic activity of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n8 \n\nbone tissue engineering scaffolds. These approaches tend to integrate into the coatings \n\nosteoinductive or bioactive agents (e. g., enzymes and antibiotics), to immobilize \n\nconstitutional elements of bone (e.g., growth factors including bone morphogenetic proteins \n\n[BMPs] and other members of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-? superfamily, adhesion \n\nproteins (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin) and peptides (e.g., the arginine-\n\nglycine-aspartic acid [RGD] sequences) on the surface of biomaterials. Immobilization and/or \n\ndelivery of bioactive molecules at specific sites have been exploited to enhance cell \n\nadhesion, differentiation, and other cell functions as well as to promote mineralization of the \n\nECM of the tissue engineered bone constructs. \n\n \n\n2. SCAFFOLDS OF NATURAL ORIGIN \u2013 POLYSACCHARIDES \n\nA large number of natural polymers, including polysaccharides, have been suggested \n\nas candidates for the production of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering purposes. \n\nPolysaccharides are relatively complex carbohydrates. They are high molecular weight \n\npolymers having one or more monosaccharide repeating units joined together by glycosidic \n\nbonds. Polysaccharides tend to be amorphous and insoluble in water. Some of the main \n\nadvantages associated with this class of polymers are wide availability, cost effectiveness, \n\ngood hemocompatibility (probably because of their similarities with heparin), nontoxicity, and \n\na wide range of properties and structures suitable for biomedical applications. These \n\npolymers have been proposed as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications as well \n\nas carriers for cells and bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, enzymes, and growth factors) for \n\ncontrolled release systems.  \n\nChitosan, starch and alginate, three examples of polysaccharide materials, will be \n\ndescribed in detail in the sections that follow. \n\n \n\n2.1. Chitosan \n\nChitosan, a naturally derived polymer, is a partially deacetylated derivative of chitin, \n\nfound in crustacea exoskeletons (e.g., shrimp, crab, and lobster), cell walls of fungi, and \n\ncuticles of insects (14, 15). Depending on the source and preparation procedure, the \n\nmolecular weight of chitosan may range from 300 to more than 1,000 kDa (11). Chitosan is a \n\nsuitable functional biomaterial because it is biocompatible, biodegradable, minimally \n\nimmunogenic, nontoxic, and hydrophilic. Moreover, it has adsorption properties with \n\nremarkable affinity for proteins, and is not expensive (16-21). Some studies report that \n\nchitosan enhanced osteogenesis (22-24) and improved wound healing (25, 26). In addition, \n\nchitosan is a hemostatic agent (11, 16), with antithrombogenic properties (27). It has proved \n\nto be a useful excipient in various drug delivery systems due to its nontoxicity, high cohesive \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n9 \n\nand hydrophilic properties, and polycationic character resulting from primary amine groups, \n\nwhich provide a high charge density in acidic solutions (pH &lt;6.5) (18, 28). It is soluble in \n\ndilute or weak acids (such as acetic and formic acid), but it is normally insoluble in aqueous \n\nsolutions above pH 6.5. \n\nChitosan is a binary polyheterosaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine \n\nwith a ?1?4 linkage. The superior tissue compatibility of chitosan can be partially attributed \n\nto its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans, which are major components of the ECM of \n\nbone and cartilage (15, 29). Chitosan is easily hydrolyzed by various chitosanases (30), \n\nwhich are completely absent in mammals, and is biodegraded in the presence of lysozyme in \n\naqueous medium in vitro (17, 31-35); this degradation process depends on the degree of \n\ndeacetylation (31), which represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units with \n\nrespect to the total number of units (30). Chitosan degradation kinetics are inversely related \n\nto the degree of deacetylation (31, 32). In vitro and in vivo, chitosan is degraded by \n\nenzymatic hydrolysis; the primary agent of this process is lysozyme, which targets acetylated \n\nresidues (36). Chitosan and glucosamine, its biodegradation product, are not toxic in vivo \n\n(37). Lysozyme, or muramidase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the \n\npeptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls (38). This enzyme is active over a broad pH range \n\n(from 3 to 8) and hydrolyzes its substrates both inside and outside cells. Lysozyme is widely \n\ndistributed in the human body (39). It is found to occur in the nose the bronchus, bronchiole, \n\nmiddle ear, lacrimal gland, bone marrow and digestive tract (16), and in lymphocytes; \n\nlysozyme is also secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which are the \n\nlargest source of the enzyme (40, 41). Monocytes and macrophages are the primary \n\ncontributors to the lysozyme content in human serum (41); the concentration in serum is in \n\nthe range of 7 to 13 mg/L (39). The susceptibility of chitosan to degradation induced by \n\nlysozyme make the protein an attractive target for incorporation into this biodegradable \n\nmaterial (29, 42-44).  \n\nIncorporation of active biomolecules, such as growth factors, has been used as a \n\nhighly beneficial strategy for improving bone regeneration in tissue engineering applications. \n\nThe biological activity of chitosan on bone regeneration has been confirmed in many studies \n\n(18, 45). Chitosan can be easily fabricated into bulk porous scaffolds, films, microparticles, \n\nsponges and beads. The feasibility of forming porous scaffolds permits wide application of \n\nthis polymer in tissue engineering. This is mainly true for bone tissue engineering \n\napplications, because chitosan supports osteoblast proliferation and phenotypic expression \n\n(15). Chitosan fiber meshes with appropriate mechanical properties, developed by \n\nTuzlakoglu et al. (46) exhibited bioactivity; this is very important aspect for biomaterials used \n\nas bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Martins et al. (35) proposed the development of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n10 \n\nchitosan-based scaffolds with the capability of forming porous structures in situ following \n\nattack by specific enzymes (namely, ?-amylase and lysozyme) present in the human body. In \n\naddition to the capability of forming pores in situ, other advantages these scaffolds have \n\nwhen compared with other conventional materials are their suitable mechanical properties \n\nand lack of toxicity. Coutinho et al. (47) studied the function of an osteoblastic-like cell line \n\n(SaOs-2) on chitosan blends with synthetic biodegradable polymers, and reported enhanced \n\nosteoblastic activity. Costa-Pinto et al. (48) formulated scaffolds based on blends of chitosan \n\nand synthetic polyesters, and provided evidence that these scaffolds are cytocompatible. \n\nFurthermore, chitosan-based scaffolds promoted the attachment and proliferation of mouse \n\nmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (48), which exhibited high levels of alkaline phosphatase \n\nactivity and produced a mineralized ECM (48). \n\n \n\n2.2. Starch \n\nStarch is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polymers with properties that \n\nmake it attractive for several biomedical applications. Starch is found as insoluble granules of \n\n?-amylose (20-30%) and amylopectin (70-80%) (49). Amylopectin polymers are highly \n\nbranched structures containing (1?4)-?-D-glucose and (1?6)-?-D-glucose linkages, \n\nwhereas amylose is much more linear with long stretches of (1?4)-?-D-glucose-linked \n\nmonomer units. Starch is extremely difficult to process and is brittle when used without the \n\naddition of a plasticizer (49). Over the years, several other materials have been blended with \n\nstarch to improve its processability, including several synthetic (50-54) and natural polymers, \n\nsuch as polysaccharides (35, 55) and proteins (56). Reis and co-workers (35, 57-70) have \n\nproposed use of starch-based scaffolds for biomedical applications. Starch exhibits low \n\ntoxicity (35, 64), biodegradability (35, 70-72), and biocompatibility (73-75), which are \n\nexcellent characteristics for bone tissue engineering applications. Compared with other \n\nbiodegradable polymers, starch is inexpensive, and above all, reusable. Specific enzymes \n\npresent in the human body, namely ?-amylase in the blood plasma, can easily degrade \n\nstarch. The main enzymes involved in starch degradation are ?-amylases, ?-amylases, ?-\n\nglucosidases, and other debranching enzymes. \n\n An important consideration of biodegradable materials of natural origin being \n\nconsidered for use in the biomedical field is the host response to the degradation products. \n\nStarch degradation products are oligosaccharides that can be metabolized to produce \n\nenergy. Due to their degradation by ?-amylases, this constitutes another strategy to control \n\nand tailor the degradation of starch-based scaffolds. Martins et al. (35) developed a novel \n\nbiodegradable matrix based on chitosan and starch, with the ability of forming a porous \n\nstructure in situ following attack by specific enzymes (namely, ?-amylase and lysozyme) \n\npresent in the human body. These researchers showed that pore size and distribution in the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n11 \n\nchitosan matrix is controlled by the location of the \u2018\u2018sacrificial\u2019\u2019 phase (i.e., native starch) that \n\nis enzymatically degradaded (35). This same study reported an interesting approach for the \n\ncontrol of matrix degradation in situ and consequent pore formation, which could result in \n\nscaffolds with mechanical properties appropriate for the initial stage of implantation (35). \n\nMartins and co-workers (76) also studied the influence of ?-amylase on the degradation of \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds based on a blend of starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL) and \n\ndemonstrated enhanced scaffold porosity and pore size and decreased average fiber \n\ndiameter with time. Furthermore, culture of rat marrow stromal cells on SPCL fiber meshes \n\n(in medium supplemented with ?-amylase) resulted in enhanced cell proliferation (76). \n\n \n\n2.3. Alginate \n\nAlginate (alginic acid or algin) is a linear polyuronate containing D-mannuronic acid \n\nand L-guluronic acid that is abundant in the cell walls of brown algae. Due to the \n\nbiocompatibility and gelation of alginate with certain divalent cations, it is widely used for cell \n\nimmobilization and encapsulation. Alginate is soluble in aqueous solutions at room \n\ntemperature and forms stable gels in the presence of calcium, barium, and strontium without \n\nchemical crosslinking agents (77); for this reason, the viability and biological activity of \n\nentrapped cells and biochemical agents are maintained in alginate gels. As a biomaterial, \n\nalginate has a number of advantages including biocompatibility and nonimmunogenicity, \n\nwhich are related to its hydrophilicity (78, 79).  \n\nSeveral studies examined alginate sponges as scaffolds for tissue engineering \n\napplications (78) and reported that their structural and morphological properties are \n\nappropriate for cell culture and proliferation as well as for neovascularization (78). Other \n\nstudies reported that alginate supports synthesis of pertinent ECM components by various \n\ncell types, and provides an amenable environment for cell encapsulation, drug delivery, and \n\ngene delivery (80). Alginate also permits the cotransplantation of multiple cell types and \n\nappropriate growth stimuli to promote, for example, the osteogenic phenotype (81). \n\nEncapsulated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were studied for the purpose of healing \n\nbone defects in orthopedics (82). Studies with gels containing MSCs and alginate beads \n\nloaded with vancomycin (a treatment for bone infections), reported that bone marrow-derived \n\nMSCs proliferated and expressed alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and type I collagen \n\ngenes (83). Cai et al. (84) reported expression of bone specific ECM markers when they \n\nexamined the ectopic bone forming ability of BMSc in combination with scaffolds made from \n\nalginate gel and implanted subcutaneously in nude mice for 8 weeks. Moreover, hydrogels \n\nsuch as alginate are effective cell substrates for both two dimensional (2D) (85) and 3D (78, \n\n85) cell cultures, indicating the suitability of alginate for tissue engineering applications. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n12 \n\n 3. CaP BIOMIMETIC COATINGS \n\nIdeally, tissue engineering scaffolds should mimic, to the greatest degree possible, \n\nthe properties of the native target tissue in an effort to promote, direct, and control \n\nregeneration of a specific, desired type of tissue. The term \u201cbiomimetics\u201d is used to describe \n\na branch of science that seeks to produce such \u201cbioinspired\u201d materials for a variety of \n\napplications.  \n\nCompared with other biomaterals, CaPs have a unique characteristic for bone \n\nmimicry and substitution. Their composition resembles that of bone mineral; most \n\nimportantly, they can induce a biological response similar to that generated during bone \n\nremodeling, which involves resorption and formation of new bone tissue (86). Osteoclasts \n\nare responsible for bone mineral degradation, resulting in bone resorption (86). During bone \n\nresorption, the degradation products of CaP (calcium and phosphate ions) are naturally \n\nmetabolized but do not cause abnormally increased calcium and phosphate levels in urine, \n\nserum, or organs (87). It should be noted that osteoclasts degrade CaP in a similar fashion \n\nas they degrade natural bone (88-90). \n\nIn 1972 Hench et al. (91) showed that \u201cBioglass\u201d (that is, glass in the Na2O-CaO-\n\nSiO2-P2O5 system), spontaneously bonded to living bone without formation of surrounding \n\nfibrous tissue. In the early 1990s, Kokubo and co-workers (92, 93) proposed that the \n\nessential requirement for a biomaterial to bond to living bone is the formation of bone-like \n\napatite on the surface of the biomaterial when implanted in vivo. This in vivo apatite \n\nformation can be reproduced in vitro using a simulated body fluid (SBF), which is a solution \n\ncontaining inorganic ion concentrations similar to those of human extracellular fluids but \n\nwithout any cells or proteins (94). Under such in vitro conditions, the formed layer consists of \n\ncarbonate apatite with small crystallites and low crystallinity (94). This apatite is referred to \n\nas \u201cbone-like apatite\u201d due to its similarity to apatite present in natural bone.  \n\nBiomimetic methodology for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite layer has \n\nbeen described in several publications (92, 95-98). This technique mimics the natural \n\nbiomineralization processes, which involve controlled crystal phase nucleation and growth. \n\nThe main advantage of the biomimetic methodology is the use of physiological conditions \n\n(pH 7.4 at 37\u00baC) simulating the conditions under which apatite is formed in bone. Moreover, \n\nthis technique allows the incorporation of proteins and bioactive agents without \n\ncompromising the activity of the agents (96, 98-101). In 1997, Reis et al. (95) adapted the \n\nmethodology developed by Kokubo and used bioactive glass as a precursor of the nucleation \n\nand growth of CaP films on starch-based polymers. Briefly, for the preparation of the \n\nbiomimetic CaP coatings based on the methodology previously developed by Abe et al. (92) \n\nand Kokubo (93) and adapted by Reis et al. (95), the materials under consideration were first \n\nimpregnated with bioactive glass, and were then immersed in simulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n13 \n\nsolution for several days at 37\u00baC; this phase is known as the \u201cnucleation stage\u201d and allows \n\nformation of CaP nuclei. In order to accelerate apatite formation, the biomaterials were \n\nsubsequently immersed at 37\u00baC in simulated body fluid solution (1.5 SBF) with an ionic \n\nconcentration 1.5-fold greater than physiological; this condition enhances CaP nuclei growth. \n\nThe CaP biomimetic coatings, which are thus formed, exhibit osteoconductive properties that \n\nwill be discussed later in this chapter. \n\n \n\n3.1. Osteoconductivity \n\nScaffolds for bone tissue engineering should be osteoconductive; that is, able to \n\nsupport the formation of bone within and/or upon the scaffold. Osteoconductivity has been \n\nobserved when porous structures were implanted into or adjacent to bone. In such cases, \n\nosteoprogenitor cells migrated into pores and filled the porous structure with newly formed \n\nbone. This process is characterized by an initial ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue that invades \n\nthe porous structure followed by later development of new bone directly within it (102). \n\nHydroxyapatite-based materials are osteoconductive, provided that fully differentiated \n\nosteogenic cells are available at the site of implantation (12). Adsorption of growth factors \n\nfrom the local milieu and from the blood circulation contributes to the osteoconductivity of \n\nhydroxyapatite by creating suitable conditions for bone formation when implanted in an \n\nosseous environment in vivo. Many relatively insoluble CaP materials are osteoconductive, \n\nand, in some cases, may induce extraskeletal new bone formation (i.e., they are \n\nosteoinductive). \n\n \n\n3.2. Osteoinductivity \n\nOsteoinduction is the process by which stem and osteoprogenitor cells are recruited \n\nto the bone healing site and stimulated to undergo osteogenic differentiation (103). \n\nOsteoinductivity implies the ability of chemical compounds to induce osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of uncommitted progenitor cells (12). It has been proposed that biomaterials do \n\nnot have an osteoinductive character in the absence of appropriate osteoinductive agents, \n\nsuch as certain BMPs and other bioactive molecules (104). However, several studies have \n\nreported that some CaP biomaterials (105-107), namely CaP coatings (107, 108), may be \n\nosteoinductive. These CaP biomaterials may induce bone formation at extraskeletal sites \n\nwithout addition of osteogenic cells or bioactive agents. Hydroxyapatite is not osteoinductive \n\nbecause it cannot induce osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells when implanted in a \n\nnonosseous environment, such as skin and muscle (12).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n14 \n\n3.3. Incorporation of biomolecules into CaP biomimetic coatings  \n\nNumerous attempts have been made to improve the osteoconductivity of \n\nbiomaterials. Coatings of CaP expedite osteoconduction and bone ingrowth at the surface of \n\nbone substitutes and, therefore, are useful strategies in tissue engineering endeavors for the \n\nregeneration of bone tissue. However, a methodology that enables regeneration of bone \n\ntissue should not only expedite osteoconduction, but also osteoinduction through \n\nbiochemical pathways (109-112). It is known that BMPs can be incorporated into CaP \n\nimplants (with adequate 3D geometry) to promote osteogenesis (112, 113); the surface of \n\nsuch implants, however, will be rapidly conditioned by several highly concentrated molecules \n\n(114). For this reason, other types of delivery-specific approaches have been investigated as \n\nalternatives that further functionalize and enhance the potential of CaP coatings. Specifically, \n\nthe CaP biomimetic coatings have been used as a carrier of molecules including \n\nosteoinductive agents such as BMPs (115-117), other proteins (101, 118, 119, 120), \n\nenzymes (96, 98, 121), and antibiotics (122, 123).  \n\nBiomimetic CaP coatings, produced as described in early parts of this chapter, are \n\ndeposited onto surfaces under physiological temperature and pH (110), enabling the \n\ncoprecipitation and consequent incorporation of biologically active molecules (99). This \n\napproach circumvents difficulties common to plasma spraying techniques. By using low \n\ntemperatures, biomimetic processes can be applied not only to highly resistant materials \n\n(e.g., metallic alloys) but also to polymeric and naturally derived implants (e.g., chitosan, \n\nstarch, and collagen) for implantation (124).  \n\nThe major objective of CaP coating is to provide appropriate biological composition \n\nand to improve the quality of the surfaces of various materials used for orthopedic \n\napplications. The conditions under which such a coating is prepared affects conformational \n\nstability of incorporated biomolecules, and thus the bioactivity and shelf-life of the final \n\nproduct. Such coatings, which are structurally and chemically comparable to the mineral \n\ncomponent of bone, can possess favorable bioactive properties that may facilitate outcomes \n\nin cases of critical clinical need (122, 125). \n\nThis alternative coating technique may be used to produce systems with several \n\nadvantages, such as reduction of burst release of incorporated molecules into the biological \n\nmilieu. In this case, biomolecules incorporated in the inorganic phase are gradually released \n\nas the latticework undergoes degradation. The advent of the slow degradation of the coating \n\nmodulates delivery of bioactive agents. Slow release of these chemical compounds may \n\nimprove the osteoinductive capacity of the implant material (100, 126). \n\nOne of the potential applications of CaP coatings relates to the incorporation of \n\nbioactive agents and proteins. Azevedo et al. (121) used a biomimetic technique pertains to \n\nincorporate of bovine serum albumin and ?-amylase into a CaP coating on the surface of a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n15 \n\nstarch-based polymer. In that study, the properties of resultant biomaterial were tailored by \n\njudicious choice of specific enzymes and their incorporation at different compositions and \n\ncombinations into CaP coatings that retained their bioactivity (121). Efficient incorporation of \n\nactive ?-amylase into biomimetic coatings controlled the degradation rate of starch-based \n\nbiomaterials. Similar results and applications were achieved with chitosan scaffolds after the \n\nincorporation of lysozyme (96, 98). Martins et al. (96, 98) incorporated lysozyme on the \n\nsurface of chitosan scaffolds in order to control the degradation rate of chitosan and \n\nsubsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since lysozyme has antibacterial properties, \n\nthese coatings may be used as a carrier for its sustained release, potentially mitigating \n\ninfection at the implantation site. Several studies reported in the literature addressed \n\nincorporation of BMPs into biomimetic CaP layers (110, 116, 125, 127). These studies \n\nindicated that CaP coatings have the potential for sustained delivery of many other bioactive \n\nagents. Liu and co-workers (99) demonstrated that BMP-2 retained its osteoinductivity when \n\ndelivered from biomimetic systems and that the osteoconductivity of implant material \n\nsurfaces was affected by BMP-2 and its delivery mode (125).  \n\nIn summary, the results discussed in this section support the strategy of adding \n\nosteoinductive signaling molecules into CaP biomimetic coatings for the purpose of inducing \n\nbone growth. \n\n  \n\n4. OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF MARROW STROMAL CELLS AND \n\nMINERALIZED ECM PRODUCTION IN VITRO  \n\nBiomaterials and scaffolds considered for bone tissue engineering are often \n\nevaluated in vitro for their ability to support adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of \n\nprogenitor cells along the osteogenic pathway prior to being evaluated in vivo. In vitro cell-\n\nscaffold interactions are determined using osteoblasts, osteosarcoma cell lines, and \n\nosteoprogenitor cells. The scaffolds used for this purpose mimic the ECM of bone and play a \n\ncrucial role in supporting cell functions and differentiation, but may also be used to deliver \n\nbiomolecules.  \n\nOsteoblastic differentiation of MSCs comprises cell proliferation, cell maturation, and \n\nmatrix mineralization. During these phases, cells synthesize and secrete alkaline \n\nphosphatase, type I collagen, and other noncollagenous ECM proteins, such as osteocalcin, \n\nosteopontin, osteonectin, and bone sialoprotein. Mineralization occurs through accumulation \n\nof calcium and phosphorous in the ECM. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n16 \n\n4.1. BMSCs versus MSCs \n\nThe osteoprogenitor cells used for bone tissue engineering purposes are derived from \n\na various tissue sources. Bone marrow stroma consists of a heterogeneous population that \n\nprovides structural and physiological support for hematopoietic cells (128). Bone marrow \n\ncontains three main cell types: endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells, and stromal cells. \n\nFriedenstein et al. (129, 130) was the first to identify in bone marrow cell populations with \n\nstrong osteogenic potential. When marrow cells are plated at low cell densities, bone marrow \n\nstromal cells (BMSCs) form colonies and are defined as \u201ccolony forming unit-fibroblasts\u201d \n\n(CFU-Fs); this term indicates that each colony derives from a single proliferating progenitor \n\n(131). The term \u201cBMSCs\u201d is applied to isolated bone marrow cells with potential to form \n\nconnective tissues (131).  \n\nDue to their high proliferation potential, BMSCs can be expanded in culture to obtain \n\nlarge numbers of cells starting from a small sample of bone marrow aspirate. The BMSC \n\npopulation contains precursor cells capable of extensive proliferation and differentiation into \n\nseveral phenotypes. Furthermore, BMSCs maintain their multipotential capacity during \n\nprolonged culture and multiple passages in vitro. Among these BMSCs there is a \n\nsubpopulation of undifferentiated multipotent cells able to generate \u2018\u2018mesenchyme\u2019\u2019, the mass \n\nof tissue that develops from the mesoderm of an embryo. This cell population is present in all \n\npostnatal tissues and is referred to as the \u201cmesenchymal stem cell\u201d (MSC) (132, 133). In the \n\npast, researchers working with cells from the bone marrow used different names to refer to \n\nthe same cells. This practice leads to nomenclature confusion; for example, BMSCs have \n\nbeen reffered to as multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), MSCs, bone marrow stromal \n\nstem cells (BMSSCs), and mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) (134). What s presently \n\nknown is that, if appropriately induced, these cells can also differentiate along multiple \n\npathways to form various cells from a number of tissues, including bone, cartilage, and fat \n\n(135).  \n\nStem cells are able to provide replacements for various differentiated cell types. The \n\nuse of MSCs has several advantages, as they have unique biological properties, are capable \n\nof extensive replication in culture in an undifferentiated state, and can differentiate along \n\nmultiple pathways to form various cells from a number of tissues, including bone, cartilage, \n\nand fat (4). Identification of stem cells using surface markers has not been definitive either, \n\nbecause similar markers are also present on nonstem cells, or because a particular marker \n\nmay only be temporarily expressed on a stem cell at a certain stage or under specific \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n17 \n\n4.2. Osteogenic differentiation \n\nIn addition to being osteoconductive and osteoinductive, an ideal scaffold for bone \n\ntissue engineering application, should also be osteogenic (that is, containing living cells \n\ncapable of differentiation into osteoblasts). Differentiation of MSCs along the osteoblastic \n\nlineage in vitro starts with a period of cell proliferation followed by synthesis and deposition of \n\nECM components by the cells; accumulation of calcium finally leads to mineralization of the \n\nECM. To induce osteogenic differentiation in MSCs, the culture medium is usually \n\nsupplemented with osteogenic agents such as dexamethasone, ?-glycerophosphate, and \n\nascorbic acid. \n\nDexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, stimulates MSC proliferation and \n\nsupports osteogenic lineage differentiation (136-138). Organic phosphates, such as ?-\n\nglycerophosphate, also support osteogenesis by contributing to mineralization of the ECM \n\nand modulating osteoblast function (138-140). Free phosphates can also induce expression \n\nof osteogenic protein markers, such as osteopontin (138, 141). Other supplements, such as \n\nascorbic acid, enhance collagen synthesis and upregulate alkaline phosphatase expression \n\nin bone cells. Ascorbic acid stimulates marrow stromal cells to differentiate along the \n\nosteoblast lineage (141-143). Furthermore, ascorbic acid promotes osteogenic induction \n\nevidenced by increased alkaline phosphatase activity and production of osteocalcin in \n\nosteogenic cultures (144). \n\nMartins et al. (76) used marrow stromal cells cultured on blends of starch with poly(?-\n\ncaprolactone) scaffolds in static cultures and reported that the enzyme lipase enhanced \n\nosteogenic differentiation and promoted deposition of mineralized ECM. The BMP family of \n\ngrowth factors is frequently used for osteoinduction. BMP-2 increases calcium-containing \n\nnodule formation and the calcium content of osteogenic cultures in vitro (138). The TGF- ? \n\nsuperfamily contains a large number of growth factors with different functions, many of which \n\nregulate cell proliferation and ECM production. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), namely \n\nFGF-1 and FGF-2 are produced by osteoblasts and are constituents of the bone matrix. \n\nInsulin-like growth factor (IGF) stimulates osteogenesis; IGF-2 is the most abundant growth \n\nfactor found in bone matrix. Gomes et al. (145) demonstrated that an in vitro generated \n\nbone-like ECM produced by marrow stromal cells contains bioactive growth factors including \n\nTGF-?1, FGF-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and BMP-2. Pham et al. (146) \n\nreported that the gene expression profiles of various bone-related growth factors and ECM \n\nproteins in MSCs cultured in osteogenic media were upregulated; these chemical \n\ncompounds are present in native bone tissue. Costa-Pinto et al. (48) studied the osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of a mouse MSC line (BMC9) cultured on novel melt-based chitosan/polyester \n\nscaffolds and reported high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n18 \n\ncalcified ECM; these results are evidence of differentiation of the cells along the osteogenic \n\npathway. \n\nExpression of osteoblastic phenotype markers in culture defines three different \n\nphases of bone-related activities: cell proliferation, ECM maturation, and ECM mineralization. \n\nDuring active cell proliferation, growth-related genes are expressed, and minimal levels of \n\ntype I collagen are observed (147). Following this phase, a period of matrix maturation \n\noccurs when alkaline phosphatase is maximally expressed. Finally, the ECM becomes \n\nmineralized, the third period of the bone developmental sequence (147). There are two \n\ntransition periods between the aforementioned developmental periods: the first occurs at the \n\nend of proliferative period and the second when expression of osteoblastic phenotype \n\nmarkers (such as osteocalcin and osteopontin), become significantly elevated with the onset \n\nof mineralization (147). \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker of the osteoblastic phenotype, is \n\nupregulated at the onset of cell differentiation but subsequently decreases as cell \n\ndifferentiation progresses. Another marker of bone formation is calcium-containing mineral \n\ndeposits in the ECM. To detect mineral deposition, tetracycline-HCl is added to the \n\nosteogenic culture media (148). Tetracycline acts as a fluorochrome-labeling agent for bone \n\ntissues (149). Tetracycline accumulates sites of bone formation and fluoresces brightly when \n\nactivated with appropriate fluorescent light. Qualitative (or semiquantitative) analysis of \n\ncalcium-containing mineral deposits in bone cell cultures uses von Kossa, alizarin red, and \n\nmethylene blue/basic fuchsin staining methods (148, 150).  An important artifact, which \n\nshould be kept in mind when using these analyses, is that the ECM uptakes calcium \n\nindependently from cell-mediated mineral deposition. For this reason, confirmation of the \n\nresults obtained using the aforementioned staining methods should be complemented with \n\ndata either diffraction or spectroscopy methods such as thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD) \n\nand Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (76, 150, 151). \n\n  Expression of osteopontin occurs during the mid- to late-stages of osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of MSCs (152). Osteopontin is an extracellular protein secreted by \n\ndifferentiating osteoblasts that is upregulated both during cell proliferation and at the onset of \n\nECM mineralization. Osteocalcin, another late-stage marker of osteoblastic differentiation, \n\ncan be assessed using commercially available immunoassays. Immunohistochemistry using \n\nspecific antibodies to detect the presence of growth factors, bone- and ECM-related proteins, \n\nand enzymes is well established and widely used. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain \n\nreaction (RT-PCR) is used to determine expression of bone-related genes, such as \n\nosteoblast marker genes, growth factors, and ECM biomolecules, in MSCs (146). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n19 \n\n4.3. Bone-specific matrix proteins \n\nThe bone matrix is not only composed of a mineralized phase, but also of an organic \n\nphase containing collagenous and other noncollagenous proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, \n\nproteoglycans, and glycoproteins. Bone formation involves regulated secretion, deposition, \n\nand removal of a complex array of these matrix proteins, which appear in a defined temporal \n\nand spatial sequence (12). Mineralization also dictates the spatial orientation of matrix \n\ndeposition (12). Most proteins originally thought to be unique to the bone ECM were \n\nsubsequently proven to be expressed in many other tissues of the body. Osteocalcin is the \n\nonly protein still considered to be bone specific in bone mineralization (12). \n\nAs discussed previously, alkaline phosphatase is considered an early-stage marker of \n\nosteoblastic differentiation (147) and is expressed during the postcell proliferative period of \n\nECM deposition. Type I collagen, the major ECM protein of bone, provides a template for \n\nsubsequent mineralization (153). Alkaline phosphatase, collagen, and osteonectin are \n\nexpressed at high levels near the end of cell proliferation and during the period of ECM \n\ndeposition and maturation (141). \n\nOsteopontin and bone sialoprotein, N-linked glycoproteins containing integrin-binding \n\nRGD motifs, are involved in cell-matrix interactions. Osteopontin is widely distributed in \n\ndifferent tissues, whereas bone sialoprotein is highly enriched in bone and skeletal cartilage \n\n(154). Osteopontin, a phosphorylated glycoprotein associated with the early stages of \n\nosteogenesis that precede mineralization, is secreted by osteoblats into the mineralizing \n\nECM during bone development (141, 155). In bone, bone sialoprotein is expressed by fully \n\nmature osteogenic cells capable of depositing mineralized matrix (154). Extracellular bone \n\nsialoprotein localizes to newly formed, mineralized bone matrix; its distribution coincides with \n\nthat of mineral deposits (156). Bone sialoprotein, a protein expressed during early phases of \n\nbone deposition, controls both mineral formation and cell-matrix interactions (157). This \n\nprotein is used as a marker of initial bone formation (157). The function of bone sialoprotein \n\nin bone, which is not been completely elucidated yet, may be related to the regulation of \n\nphysiological mineralization of skeletal ECMs (156, 158). Osteocalcin is another marker of \n\nlate-term osteogenic differentiation associated with osteoblast-mediated matrix deposition \n\nand mineralization (159, 160). Expression of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein \n\noccurs later during the third period of ECM mineralization. \n\n \n\n5. SUMMARY \n\nSurface modification of biomaterials uses methods that mimic biomineralization and \n\nenable the incorporation of bioactive molecules and agents; such treatments can improve \n\nboth in vitro and in vivo osteogenic differentiation. The main objective of CaP coatings is \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n20 \n\nosteoconduction and enhanced adhesion of osteogenic cells onto biomaterial surfaces. \n\nBecause CaP coatings have structures and chemical properties similar to those of native \n\nbone, they have great potential and promise to increase bone ingrowth in areas of clinical \n\nneed. \n\nBecause they lack essential properties, such as bioactivity and osteoinductivity, most \n\ncurrently available polymers present limitations for bone-related biomedical application. In \n\nthis respect then, the biomimetic coating technique discussed in the present chapter has the \n\npotential to impart these essential properties to biomaterials. Since CaP layers can be on 3D \n\nscaffolds the biomimetic coating approach has been receiving increased attention in the \n\nbone tissue engineering field.  \n\nMoreover, CaP coatings have been considered as a potential carrier for the delivery \n\nof various biomolecules, chosen for their physicochemical and biological properties, as well \n\nas for their osteoconductivity. Complementing the CaP biomimetic coating approach, \n\nincorporation of biomolecules provides osteoinductive properties to biomaterials. Since this \n\nmethod is carried out under physiological conditions, proteins, enzymes, and other bioactive \n\nagents can be incorporated into CaP layers without loss of their activity. A major advantage \n\nis the fact that the biomaterial-CaP coating-biomolecule can simultaneously exhibit \n\nosteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, because it can act as a carrier system for the \n\ncontrolled release of multiple biologically active proteins. Incorporation of enzymes into CaP \n\nlayers coated on the surface of scaffolds (using the biomimetic coating technique) can be \n\nalso used to control the degradation rate of the material substrate in vivo. An integrated \n\napproach combining a scaffold, CaP coatings, bioactive molecules and/or enzymes, and in \n\nvitro cultures may provide an optimal environment for cell adhesion and osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation as well as generate a mineralized ECM containing select bioactive molecules. \n\nIncorporation of bioactive molecules into CaP coatings on scaffolds for bone tissue \n\nengineering applications has the potential to provide advanced tissue-specific constructs to \n\npromote improved alternative treatment of bone pathologies and trauma. The present \n\nchapter summarized the results of studies that used biomolecules important to elucidate \n\nimportant aspects such as details of the release profiles of entrapped bioactive molecules \n\nand retention of their bioactivity. Establishment and further development of nature-inspired \n\ntechniques to design and formulate novel biomaterials could provide the next generation of \n\neffective scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

Martins, C.M. Alves, F.K. Kasper, A.G. Mikos, R.L. Reis. Naturally Derived Responsive and In \n\nSitu-Forming Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications: An Overview of the Last Decade, \n\nsubmitted.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n36 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nBone is a highly vascular, living and dynamic tissue remarkable for its combination of \n\nmechanical properties and regenerative capacity. Bone possesses self-regeneration \n\ncapacity. However, there is a limit to the size of bone fractures and defects that can be self-\n\nrepaired. This limit is designated as the \u201ccritical size defect\u201d1-3 and will not heal during the \n\nlifetime of the patient. For large defects medical intervention is often necessary to repair the \n\nbone. A new field of research that proposes the regeneration of the tissue instead of its \n\nsubstitution is defined as tissue engineering: \u201can interdisciplinary field of research that \n\napplies the principles of engineering and the life sciences towards the development of \n\nbiological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function\u201d4.  Tissue engineering \n\nstrategies involving scaffolds include two general categories: (1) the use of acellular matrices \n\n(artificial scaffolds or decellularized tissues), which depend upon the natural ability of the \n\nbody to regenerate for proper orientation and direction of new tissue growth, and (2) the use \n\nof scaffolds with cells4, 5. But the most classical paradigm of Tissue Engineering for tissue \n\nregeneration implies the use of a degradable support or scaffold material, bioactive factors \n\nand cells4, 6, 7. Several characteristics and properties have been described 8, 9 as sine qua \n\nnon requirements for a suitable scaffold to be used in bone tissue engineering: \n\nbiocompatibility, biodegradability into nontoxic products, and the ability to resorb at the \n\nadequate rate follow the repair of bone; adequate surface characteristics for cell adhesion \n\nand proliferation; an interconnected porous structure that enable tissue ingrowth, \n\nvascularisation, exchange of nutrients, oxygen and metabolites; and suitable mechanical \n\nproperties matching those of the native tissue. The biomaterial must maintain its structural \n\nintegrity during the first stages of the new bone formation. The main aim behind the different \n\napproaches of bone tissue engineering consists of developing a functionalized responsive \n\nand bioresorbable scaffold able to stimulate cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, \n\nwith the objective that osteoblasts produce bone extracellular matrix (ECM). \n\nLearning from Nature is a concept that implies mimicking Nature to develop novel \n\nfunctional biomaterials such as biomineralized, \u201csmart\u201d or bonelike composite materials10-15. \n\n\u201cSmart\u201d scaffolds and bioreactors are being developed to enable advanced procedures for \n\ndelivery of bioactive molecules and mechanical stimuli to cultured cells in order to direct \n\nosteogenic differentiation13, 14, 16-19. It has been stimulated increased attention for responsive \n\nstrategies in vitro, such as the use of flow perfusion bioreactors. The strategy includes the \n\nculture of bone marrow stromal cells onto scaffolds under flow conditions which allow a \n\nbetter distribution of nutrients and oxygen and the necessary mechanical stimuli for cellular \n\ndifferentiation along the osteogenic lineage20-22. This approach is an ideal system for the ex \n\nvivo production of bone constructs23-25. Notwithstanding the deeply discussed typical bone \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n37 \n\ntissue engineering strategy, which involves the use of a porous scaffold, cells and bioactive \n\nmolecules, this review will focus on alternative approaches, such as the use of \n\n\u201csmart\u201d/responsive acellular scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. \n\nThe role of naturally derived materials and environmental stimuli in modulating bone \n\nregeneration will be discussed. While many excellent biomaterials have been developed in \n\nrecent years, their translation into clinical practice has been slow. Chitosan was the selected \n\nnatural polymer to be explored in this review mainly because of its pH responsive properties \n\nand biodegradability. The present review intends to provide an overview of the current state \n\nof the art of naturally derived responsive scaffolds and in situ-forming concepts for bone \n\ntissue engineering applications, their aims and limitations. \n\n \n\n2. SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING \n\nThe simplest way to define a scaffold for tissue engineering is that it should provide \n\nmechanical support, shape, and cell-scale architecture for neo-tissue construction in vitro or \n\nin vivo as seeded cells expand and organize26. Scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix and \n\nhave a crucial role to play in supporting cell growth, differentiation and in delivering growth \n\nfactors or other bioactive molecules. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in bone formation, \n\nremodelling, and repair and its components include minerals, ions, proteins, and enzymes. \n\nThe traditional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering should present standard parameters \n\nsuch as high porosity, large surface area, mechanical properties and pore sizes appropriate \n\nfor the intended application, and a highly interconnected pore structure4, 7, 27. It has been \n\nreported that high porosity and pore sizes of 100-400 ?m in the scaffold are necessary for \n\nbone ingrowth7, 28. In addition, biocompatibility and biodegradability are also required \n\nproperties of scaffolds13, 14. In this review we will highlight some characteristics of acellular \n\nscaffolds, such as mechanical properties and biodegradability.  \n\nThe degradation rate of the scaffolds must be tuned appropriately with the growth rate \n\nof the new tissue, by the time the injury site is totally regenerated the scaffold should be \n\ntotally degraded2, 13, 14. If the degradation is faster than the tissue regeneration, the scaffolds \n\nwill loose its support function for tissue growth. On the other hand, if the degradation is too \n\nslow compared to tissue formation, the scaffold will compromise the regeneration of the \n\ntissue. Mechanical properties of bulk materials represent an important group of \n\ncharacteristics to considerer in three-dimensional (3D) artificial ECM (scaffold) design29. Bulk \n\nmaterials are fundamental contributors to the mechanical integrity of the scaffold. This \n\nproperty is especially important for tissue engineering of structural tissues. Thus, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n38 \n\nscaffolds should have mechanical properties resembling those of healthy tissue during the \n\nperiod of tissue regeneration7, 27. Mechanical strength is needed for the creation of a 3D \n\nstructure that will retain its structure after implantation, particularly in the reconstruction of \n\nhard and load-bearing bone tissues28.  \n\n \n\n2.1. Mechanical properties \n\nThe mechanical properties of the implanted scaffold should ideally match those of \n\nliving bone7, 27, 30. This demanding balance represents one limitation of scaffolds intended for \n\nbone regeneration and generally leads to mechanical biomaterial failure. Low mechanical \n\nstrength of porous scaffolds may not be suitable for the repair of load-bearing tissues in \n\nsome clinical applications31. Depending upon the application, mechanical properties should \n\nbe studied keeping in mind the surrounding environment of the scaffold once placed in an in \n\nvivo system. The initial mechanical properties of the scaffold to be implanted are extremely \n\nimportant and ideally should be similar to those of the bone that is intended to be \n\nregenerated. Besides providing appropriate support in the early stages of healing, the long-\n\nterm success of the biomaterial will depend on the efficacious graded load transfer needed in \n\nthe later stages of the remodelling process32. The mechanical properties of the two types of \n\nbone, i.e., the cortical (compact) and cancellous (spongy) bone, are listed in Table 1. Highly \n\nporous structures with interconnected pores may fail their objective due to poor mechanical \n\nproperties.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Mechanisms of polymer biodegradation \n\nControlling the degradation of scaffolds to match the rate of bone growth, to create \n\nspace for the new bone formation until full regeneration is reached, remains a major \n\nchallenge in scaffold design. The ideal degradable material degrades during its intended \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n39 \n\napplication or immediately after it. The process of polymer degradation describes the \n\nmechanisms through which polymer chains are cleaved to form oligomers and finally \n\nmonomers34. The process of erosion designates the loss of material owing to monomers and \n\noligomers leaving the polymer34, 35.  All biodegradable polymers have hydrolysable bonds. \n\nTheir most important degradation mechanism is enzymatic hydrolysis. The latter effect is \n\ndesignated as biodegradation meaning that the degradation is mediated by a biological \n\nprocess34. Several factors influence the kinetics of degradation: the type of chemical bonds, \n\npH, polymer composition, crystallinity, molecular weight, porosity, water uptake and location \n\nof the implant34. Hydrophilic polymers absorb large quantities of water and increase \n\ndegradation rates. Resorbable biomaterials have the ability to resorb over time. This \n\nbehaviour is necessary to support the gradual ingrowth of cells and complete replacement of \n\na regenerated matrix by normal tissue, and to avoid risk of complications that can be \n\nassociated with the long-term presence of foreign material36. Scaffold evaluation also \n\nincludes studying the appropriate degradation rate, which is important because as the \n\nscaffold degrades it is replaced by natural tissue. Biodegradation is generally required for a \n\ntissue engineering scaffold material, and the degradation rate also needs to match the neo \n\ntissue formation rate to ideally serve the template purpose27, 28, 37. Bone tissue engineering \n\ngenerally requires an artificial extracellular matrix (scaffold) to regenerate tissue at the site of \n\nimplantation. This scaffold should disappear through absorption into the body as the new \n\ntissue is regenerated37.   \n\n \n\n3. \u201cSMART\u201d AND RESPONSIVE SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING  \n\nStimuli-responsive, \u201csmart\u201d, \u201cintelligent\u201d or environmentally-sensitive polymers \n\nrespond with large property changes to small chemical, physical or biochemical stimuli \n\n(Table 2). The concept of \u201csmart\u201d polymers derived from the development of biomaterials that \n\nshow large conformational changes in response to small environmental stimuli such as \n\ntemperature, ionic strength, pH, or light26, 38. The materials that respond to changes in their \n\nsurrounding environment are very attractive because these changes, mainly in vivo, can be \n\nexploited to control parameters such as drug delivery, cell adhesion, mechanical properties, \n\nand permeability, among others39. The responses of the polymer may include precipitation or \n\ngelation, reversible adsorption on a surface, collapse of a hydrogel or surface graft, and \n\nalternation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states26, 40. Natural polymers may present a \n\nmore appropriate biological environment to the cells, since they usually contain domains that \n\ncan send important signals to guide the cells at various stages of development41. Collagen \n\nand fibrin, natural ECM molecules, have been used as scaffolds for tissue engineering. They \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n40 \n\nhave interesting biological properties for tissue engineering research42-45. However, their low \n\nmechanical properties, the risk of viral infection, antigenicity, instability and deterioration that \n\nfollow long-term implantation limit the clinical applications of these natural biomaterials37. \n\n \n\nTable 2.

CHITOSAN SCAFFOLDS AS A RESPONSIVE BIOMATERIAL  \n\nPolysaccharides are very attractive for tissue engineering applications mainly \n\nbecause of their biodegradability, biocompatibility and resemblance with the environment of \n\nthe extracellular matrix47, 48. Examples of anionic naturally derived polymers are alginate, \n\nhyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and carragenans48. However chitosan is the only \n\ncationic polysaccharide found in Nature. In the last decade, significant attention has been \n\ngiven to chitosan-based biomaterials13, 49-55 in the field of bone tissue engineering. This \n\nreview will focus on chitosan, a polycationic natural-origin polymer produced by the \n\ndeacetylation of chitin, a natural component of crustacea exoskeletons (e.g. shrimp, crab, \n\nlobster, etc.), cell walls of fungi and cuticles of insects54, 56. Chitosan is a binary \n\npolyheterosaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine with a ?1?4 linkage. The \n\nsuperior tissue compatibility of chitosan can be partially attributed to its structural similarity to \n\nglycosaminoglycans, which are major components of the ECM of bone and cartilage54, 57. \n\nChitosan exhibits a pH-sensitive behavior due to the large quantities of amino groups on its \n\nchains. It is a biocompatible, pH-dependent cationic polymer, which is insoluble in aqueous \n\nsolutions above pH 755. However, in dilute or weak acids (pH<6), the protonated free amino \n\ngroups of glucosamine facilitate solubility of the molecule55. Above pH 6.2 chitosan aqueous \n\nsolutions lead to the formation of a hydrated gel-like precipitate58, 59. Temperature and pH \n\nhave been extensively studied in the biomedical field because these two parameters can be \n\neasily controlled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo. Dias et al.60 reported the use of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n41 \n\nchitosan, a natural and pH-responsive polymer, grafted onto a biodegradable bioactive \n\ncomposite and investigated the effect of pH on the biomineralization process. The authors \n\nsuccessfully developed \u201csmart\u201d biodegradable surfaces that respond to pH and that could be \n\nused to control the biomineralization process. They also found that the formation of \n\nbiomimetic apatite was dependent on the conformational changes of chitosan across its \n\ncritical pH and could be controlled by pH switching.  \n\nChitosan hydrogels have been used in a number of gene and drug delivery \n\napplications and can deliver growth factors and pharmaceutical agents in a controlled \n\nfashion61-63. Due to its cationic nature and predictable degradation rate, chitosan-based \n\nmaterials bind growth factors and release them in a controlled manner64.  \n\nChitosan is degraded, depending on degree of deacetylation by enzymes such as \n\nlysozyme, N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase and lipases61. In vivo, chitosan is degraded by \n\nenzymatic hydrolysis, primarily by lysozyme which appears to target acetylated residues65, 66. \n\nDegradation kinetics seem to be inversely related to the degree of deacetylation65. The \n\ndegree of deacetylation represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units with \n\nrespect to the total number of units67. Lysozyme breaks down the chitosan polymer chain, \n\ndiminishing its molecular weight until it becomes short enough to be processed by cells. \n\nGlucosamines, the final degradation products of chitosan, are nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, \n\nand noncarcinogenic68. In vivo, the final degradation products undergo normal metabolism \n\npathways and may be incorporated into glycoproteins or excreted as carbon dioxide gas \n\nduring respiration69, 70. Lysozyme or muramidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis \n\nof the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls71. This enzyme is active over a broad pH \n\nrange from 3 to 8 and is suited to hydrolyze its substrates both inside and outside cells. \n\nLysozyme is ubiquitous in the human body72. It is present in lymphocytes and also secreted \n\nby monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which account for the largest source73, 74. \n\nMonocytes and macrophages are the dominating contributors to the lysozyme content in \n\nserum73. Human serum lysozyme is found in concentrations from 7 to 13 mg/L72. \n\nChitosan possesses interesting characteristics, such as its ability to induce a minimal \n\nforeign body reaction, an intrinsic antibacterial nature75, 76, and the ability to be molded in \n\nvarious shapes, namely porous structures, suitable for cell ingrowth and osteoconduction. \n\nThe mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds are dependent on the pore size and pore \n\norientation75.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n42 \n\n5. NATURALLY DERIVED IN SITU FORMING SCAFFOLDS  \n\nThe goal of the in situ generated implant strategy is used to engineer biomedical \n\nsystems at their site of performance using minimally invasive surgeries77. Several \n\napproaches have been developed78-80 namely synthetic in situ scaffolding materials that \n\ncould deliver cells or provide a structure for tissue infiltration. Naturally occurring polymers \n\nthat form thermoreversible gels include gelatine, carrageenan, cellulose derivatives, \n\nxyloglucan and chitosan with glycerophosphate58. Moreover, several natural biomaterials, \n\nincluding collagen, heparin, hyaluronate, and fibrin have been used for the preparation of \n\ninjectable in situ-forming scaffolds81-86. Besides eliminating the need for ex vivo implant \n\nfabrication, the contact and adhesion between the biomaterial and native bone may be \n\nenhanced with a polymer formed directly in the bone defect (in situ)87. Current approaches \n\nfor implanting medical devices often require complex surgeries. In the past few years, an \n\nincreasing number of in situ-forming systems have been proposed for various biomedical \n\napplications, including drug delivery88-90, cell encapsulation58, 91, and tissue repair83, 92, 93. \n\nThere are several possible mechanisms leading to in situ implant formation. It has become \n\nincreasingly apparent that scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications should provide \n\nmore than temporary 3D structure for developing tissue construct. Due to the pH-sensitive \n\ncharacter of chitosan, this polymer has great potential to be used in the fabrication of scaffold \n\nand gels that respond to localized conditions of pH in the human body. Hai Bang Lee et al.94 \n\nstated that it is difficult to perform ex vivo fabrication of certain complex scaffold geometries. \n\nAs an alternative, they reported the use of in situ\u2013forming scaffolds as a promising approach \n\nfor the fabrication of complicated scaffold geometries. The in situ\u2013forming scaffold is based \n\non the idea that if a biomaterial undergoes a simple liquid-to-gel phase transition under \n\nphysiological conditions, it can be injected as a liquid, and then form the desired gel in situ94-\n\n96. As previously reported, Ruel-Gariepy et al.58, 97 demonstrated that a mixture of chitosan \n\nand glycerol phosphate disodium salt (?-glycerophosphate) is capable of forming a gel \n\nscaffold in situ. These formulations possess a neutral pH, remain liquid at or below room \n\ntemperature, and form monolithic gels at body temperature58. The stability of the solution at \n\nroom temperature and the gelation time increases as the degree of deacetylation \n\ndecreases58, 97. Hai Bang Lee et al.94 described the development of in situ\u2013forming chitosan \n\ngels, and their ability to offer a suitable scaffold for rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) \n\nin vitro and in vivo. The in situ-forming scaffold provides numerous benefits, such as its being \n\na noninvasive alternative for tissue engineering applications. These results showed that \n\nchitosan gel can serve as an in situ\u2013forming gel scaffold for entrapped rBMSCs in vivo. \n\nStudies dealing with the role of stem/progenitor cells in osteogenesis show that chitosan has \n\nthe ability to promote osteogenic progenitor cell recruitment and attachment, facilitating bone \n\nformation98.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n43 \n\nAs cell and molecular biology converge with materials science and biomedical \n\nengineering, new applications will benefit from interactive biomaterials that serve to \n\norchestrate cell attachment, growth and differentiation26. Recently, a considerable interest \n\nhas been given to the development of \u201csmart\u201d materials with the ability to instruct the \n\nbehaviour of cells by releasing bioactive molecules into the local environment99, 100.  \n\n \n\n6. IN SITU PORE-FORMING SCAFFOLDS \n\nOne of the major challenges of bone tissue engineering is the development of \n\nscaffolds capable of promoting the differentiation of immature progenitor cells down an \n\nosteoblastic lineage (osteoinduction) encouraging the ingrowth of surrounding bone \n\n(osteoconduction) and integration into the surrounding tissue101, 102. The main goal of the in \n\nsitu forming scaffolds strategy is to generate systems at their site of implantation using \n\nminimally invasive surgical procedures or eliminate some steps of the common strategies \n\nused in bone tissue engineering applications (i.e., cell seeding onto scaffolds ex vivo).  \n\nAcellular scaffolds with properties capable to induce bone regeneration could be an \n\ninteresting alternative. \n\nOne innovative approach was described by the group of by the group of Robert \n\nLanger103 for the first time in 2003 proposing in situ pore formation in a polymer matrix by \n\ndifferential degradation. The common approaches have been developed to introduce porosity \n\nin a polymer matrix ex vivo and thus facilitate cell seeding either in vitro or in vivo. In that \n\npaper, the authors stated that controlling pore formation in vivo with specific tissue ingrowth \n\ncould be beneficial for bone tissue engineering and presented a new paradigm for the \n\nformation of pores in a polymer matrix in situ 103. For that, polymer microspheres were used \n\nas a pore-forming agent (porogen)103. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that hydrophilic polymers such as chitosan, depending on \n\nthe processing method and shape present suitable mechanical properties for bone tissue \n\nengineering applications13.  \n\nThe inclusion of enzymatically degradable phases in biomaterials seems to be a very \n\npromising approach to obtain scaffolds with adequate mechanical properties in the initial \n\nstage of implantation and with a gradual in vivo pore-forming ability. Martins et al.13 described \n\nthe development of a biodegradable matrix, based on chitosan and starch with the ability of \n\nforming a porous structure in situ due to the attack by specific enzymes present in the human \n\nbody, taking advantage of the inflammatory response. One of the critical factors that can \n\ncontrol bone tissue regeneration is the degradation rate of the scaffold, as previously \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n44 \n\ndiscussed. Tailoring the degradation rate of scaffolds can facilitate scaffold remodelling and \n\nreplacement by cells in situ, enhancing bone tissue regeneration. Inflammation is often \n\nviewed as a negative event, but it is fundamental for tissue regeneration processes104. \n\nConsequently, modulating the response of implanted material by harnessing characteristics \n\nof the inflammatory response is a powerful tool for driving tissue regeneration in situ. In this \n\nsection alternative strategies will be discussed, such as the potential of using responsive \n\nscaffolds to take advantage of the host inflammatory response and thus obtain a beneficial \n\noutcome for bone tissue engineering applications. When a material is implanted, an acute \n\ninflammation is initiated involving several cell types105-107. During inflammation neutrophils, \n\nmonocytes and macrophages are present. These cells release lysosomal enzymes, such as \n\nlysozyme, into the surrounding tissue108. It has been suggested that macrophages and \n\nneutrophils produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl free radicals which \n\ncontribute to the biodegradation of implanted materials108. The results of the compressive \n\ntests showed that these materials, based on chitosan and starch exhibited very interesting \n\nmechanical properties in the dry and even in the wet state13. The mechanical properties \n\nexhibited by the scaffolds in the wet state fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus \n\nfor trabecular bone7, 28. This approach seem to be a promising strategy to produce an in vivo \n\nresponsive scaffold, the properties of which may be regulated by the bone regeneration \n\nprocess, with gradual formation of pores in situ and consequent resorption. Using this \n\ninnovative methodology, the developed scaffolds can exhibit suitable mechanical properties \n\nat the initial stage of implantation due to the inexistence of macroporosity. The porosity will \n\nbe formed in situ by enzymes present in the human body. In this work, authors aimed at \n\ndeveloping a biodegradable matrix based on chitosan and native starch that forms a porous \n\nstructure in vivo due to the incorporation of the \u201csacrifice\u201d phase (native starch) that will be \n\npreferentially attacked by specific enzymes and other reactive species present in the human \n\nbody during the inflammatory response (Figure 1). \n\nBiomimetic coating\n\nLysozyme\n\nSBF\n\n36.5 \u00baC\n\nChitosan \nscaffold\n\nIn vitro\n\nCa-P coating\n\nChitosan\n\nEnzymes\n- Lysozyme\n\nCoating \n\ndissolution/resorption\n\nIn vivo In vivo\n\nBiomimetic coating\n\nLysozyme\n\nSBF\n\n36.5 \u00baC\n\nChitosan \nscaffold\n\nIn vitro\n\nCa-P coating\n\nChitosan\n\nEnzymes\n- Lysozyme\n\nCoating \n\ndissolution/resorption\n\nIn vivo In vivo\n\n \n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of in situ pore forming concept. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n45 \n\nAn alternative approach, involving the concept of bioactivity and osteoconduction, is \n\nto let degradation proceed along a coordinate of the healing process by making the material \n\nsensitive to the feedback provided by the cells involved in the healing response109. A \n\nbiomimetic scaffold for bone tissue engineering can be any scaffolding material that mimics \n\none or multiple characteristics of the natural ECM110. Functional materials such as calcium \n\nphosphate (CaP)111 and hydroxyapatite112 are often mixed with bulk materials to mimic bone \n\nECM composition. CaP has a composition similar to bone mineral and can induce a \n\nbiological response identical to that generated in bone remodelling113. The process of \n\nresorption of old bone mineral and formation of new bone is designated as bone \n\nremodelling113. The biomimetic technique for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite \n\nlayer is well described18, 114-116 and has been applied for the first time to biodegradable \n\nsubstrates and then to scaffolds by Reis et al.18, 51, 61, 115, 117, 118. Biomimetic CaP coating \n\ninvolves immersion of polymers in simulated body fluid (SBF), a solution with ion \n\nconcentration identical to human plasma. CaP coatings have shown high efficiency in \n\nexpediting bone osteoconduction119. However, for the regeneration of bone, osteoconduction \n\nis also important100. The incorporation of proteins and enzymes18, 120-127 into CaP coatings is \n\nwell documented.  Further studies proposed an innovative self-regulated degrading material \n\nwith gradual in situ pore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications. In this \n\nstudy127 one of the main aims was to improve the osteoconductive properties of chitosan \n\nscaffolds. For that, lysozyme was incorporated into CaP coatings, prepared on the surface of \n\nchitosan scaffolds using a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling their \n\ndegradation rate and subsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since lysozyme has \n\nantibacterial properties, these coatings may act as carriers for its sustained release, \n\npreventing infection upon implantation. Moreover, CaP coatings will enhance the \n\nosteoconductive properties of the chitosan scaffolds. Mineral deposition has been shown to \n\nslow scaffold degradation, probably by creating a barrier between the scaffold surface and \n\nsurrounding environment128. In order to avoid this, one possible solution was the \n\nincorporation of the enzyme lysozyme to enhance degradation of chitosan scaffolds and \n\nsubsequent formation of pores in situ (Figure 2). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

Schematic representation of a self-regulated degrading material with gradual in situ pore \n\nformation ability. \n\n \n\nResponsive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering do not need to show the stimulus-\n\ndependent change in a reversible fashion. For example, after the cells or bioactive molecules \n\nare delivered, the scaffolds do not need to reverse the process. As it was discussed above, \n\nbiodegradability and lack of cytotoxicity are required characteristics of bone tissue \n\nengineering scaffolds.  \n\n\u201cSmart\u201d/responsive polymers may offer promise for revolutionary improvements in \n\ntissue engineering scaffolds. Beyond the physical properties of polymers, a major goal is to \n\nimprove the mechanical properties at the initial stage of implantation and if possible to avoid \n\none of the most critical steps of the tissue engineering approach, that is the pre-seeding of \n\nthe scaffolds with cells. Creating scaffolds with specific properties that per se could recruit \n\ncells to the site of implantation is in our opinion one of the main current challenges in the \n\nfield.  \n\n \n\n7. CONCLUSIONS \n\nTherapies for the treatment of lost tissue include tissue transplantation, surgical \n\nreconstruction, drug therapy, synthetic prostheses and medical devices or associations of \n\nthose. The efforts to address their limitations have elicited the development of different \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Introduction  \n\n\u00a0\n\n47 \n\nbiomaterials and therapies. In this review we aimed at presenting as alternative approaches \n\nthe engineering of responsive and in situ-forming scaffolds for bone regeneration. \n\nChitosan is one of the most promising natural polymers for bone tissue engineering \n\ndue, in part, to its particular ability to form various shapes and structures. The predictable \n\ndegradation rate and the ability of forming a porous structures and scaffolds in situ makes \n\nchitosan interesting alternative biomaterial for orthopaedic applications.  \n\nIn the first part of this review, biodegradation and mechanical properties were \n\nhighlighted as necessary requirements for the implantation of acellular scaffolds. In the \n\nsecond part, we presented developments and examples of naturally derived responsive \n\nscaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Finally, we described a new strategy for bone tissue \n\nengineering: the in situ pore-forming concept. Despite the recent advances, future research \n\nfocusing on the development of novel scaffolds that per se could recruit the desirable cells, \n\nregenerate the site of implantation and reabsorb as a function of degradation time still \n\ncomprises one of the most demanding and challenging strategies in the field of bone tissue \n\nengineering.  \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n59 \n\nCHAPTER II \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n1. PRODUCTION OF THE MATERIALS \n\n1.1. SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds \n\nPorous scaffolds used in the Chapters III and IV were based on a blend of corn starch \n\nand poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70%) prepared using a fiber bonding technique [1]. \n\nSPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were cylinders with 8-mm diameter and thickness of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1mm \n\n[2]. Previous studies have demonstrated that these scaffolds were able to induce ostegenic \n\ndifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells when flow perfusion bioreactors were used, as well \n\nas, to express in vitro, several bone growth factors that are usually associated with bone \n\nformation in vivo [1, 3, 4].  \n\n \n\n1.2. Chitosan-based scaffolds \n\nFinely ground chitosan (DD of 95%) powder was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to \n\nobtain a 5% (w/v) clear solution (CH) without any particulate material. Because of the \n\nrelatively high concentration, these solutions are quite viscous and consequently can be \n\nstirred only slightly. However, flow is still observed and it is still possible to inject such \n\nviscous solutions to fill out the moulds. Then, using the same procedure, other formulations \n\nwere prepared using native corn starch with the following ratios: 80/20 chitosan/starch \n\nscaffolds (CS80-20) and 60/40 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS60-40). The solutions were \n\ncasted into moulds and frozen (-18 \u00baC) overnight. \n\nTo produce chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds, the solutions were immersed in a \n\nprecipitation solution with containing 25% NaOH 1M and 75% of Na2SO4 0.5M (Panreac, \n\nBarcelona, Spain) adapted from Tuzlakoglu et al. [5]. After precipitation, the samples were \n\nwashed repeatedly with distilled water to remove excess of salts, dried at 37 \u00baC and followed \n\nby successive washings for 5 days until no pH changes were detected. These scaffolds were \n\nused in the studies presented in Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n60 \n\n1.3. Chitosan-based scaffolds coated with CaP coating and incorporated lysozyme \n\nThe method to prepare the biomimetic CaP coatings was based on the methodology \n\npreviously developed by Abe and Kokubo et al. [6] and adapted by Reis et al. [7, 8] \n\nconsisting in an impregnation of the materials with bioactive glass (Bioglass?45S5, NovaMin \n\nTechnology Inc or NOVABONE, Alachua, Florida, USA) followed by immersion in a \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF, 37 \u00baC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human \n\nblood plasma. Prior to the coating process, chitosan scaffolds (CH) and chitosan/starch \n\nscaffolds (CS) were sterilized by ethylene oxide. Bioglass? 45S5 was sterilized by immersion \n\nin ethanol solution (70% v/v) and then dried inside the hood. All the subsequent work was \n\nperformed under sterile conditions in a hood. Briefly, CH and CS scaffolds were rolled in a \n\nwet bed of Bioglass? for the studies described in Chapter VI or in a rotator for 6 hours \n\n(Chapters VII and VIII). After that, the scaffolds where immersed in simulated body fluid (1.0 \n\nSBF) solution with and without lysozyme from chichen egg white (1 g/L) for 7 days at 37\u00baC \n\n(nucleation stage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP nuclei while lysozyme is \n\nincorporated. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with distilled water and \n\nimmersed in a concentrated simulated body fluid solution (1.5 SBF) for 7 days at 37\u00baC in \n\norder to enhance CaP nuclei growth (growth stage). Four different samples were obtained \n\nusing the biomimetic coating technique: CaP chitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP \n\nchitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme \n\n(CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS \n\n+ lysozyme). All the solutions were sterilized by filtration prior use.  \n\n \n\n1.4. Reagents \n\nAll chemical reagents used in the experimental results were purchased from Sigma \n\n(St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. \n\n \n\n2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED SCAFFOLDS \n\n \n\n2.1. Mechanical properties \u2013 compression tests \n\nThe mechanical properties of the materials described in Chapter V were evaluated on \n\ncompression tests carried out in the dry and wet state in an Instron 4505 universal \n\nmechanical testing machine at a controlled environment (23 \u00baC and 55% RH). The crosshead \n\nspeed was 2 mm min-1 1% strain. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n61 \n\n2.2. Degradation studies \n\nSeveral degradation studies were carried out with and without enzymes in Chapters \n\nIII, V, VI, and VII. \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Degradation studies with ?-amylase or lipase in static and dynamic conditions \n\nDegradation studies were carried out by incubating samples in phosphate buffered \n\nsaline (PBS) solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L) [9, 10] from Bacillus sp. \n\nor lipase (110 U/L) [10] from Aspergillus niger, both concentrations similar to those found in \n\nhuman serum, and sodium azide (0.2%), to avoid contamination, at 37 \u00baC up to 30 days \n\nunder static and dynamic conditions (shaker at 70 rpm).The studies were performed in \n\ntriplicate. The enzymatic degradation solutions were changed every 7 days to restore the \n\noriginal level of enzymatic activity. At the and of the degradation period, the samples were \n\nremoved, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried in graded series of ethanol for \n\nlater calculation of weight loss. These results are described in Chapter III. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Degradation studies with ?-amylase and lysozyme \n\nDegradation studies were carried out by incubating the scaffolds in phosphate \n\nbuffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L [9]) and/or lysozyme \n\n(13 mg/L [11, 12]) at concentrations similar to the ones found in human serum, at 37 \u00baC up to \n\n90 days. A control was also performed by incubating the samples in buffer alone. \n\nDegradation solutions were also analyzed to measure the concentration of reducing sugars, \n\nreleased into the solution as a result of starch hydrolysis by ?-amylase, using the \n\ndinitrosalicylic acid method. These studies are described in Chapter V. \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Degradation studies at pH 7.4 and pH 5 \n\nIn order to simulate in vivo conditions, degradation studies were carried out by \n\nincubating uncoated chitosan scaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, with and without \n\nincorporated lysozyme, in two different buffer solutions: (i) Tris-HCl buffer (0.22 mM, pH 7.4) \n\nto simulate the normal pH found in human body and (ii) citrate buffer (1.0 mM, pH 5.0) to \n\nsimulate the inflammatory response at 37 \u00baC for different periods of time. These studies are \n\ndescribed in Chapter VI. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n62 \n\n2.2.4. Degradation studies with lysozyme \n\nDegradation studies presented in Chapter VII were performed by incubating the \n\nchitosan scaffolds (CH) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) with lysozyme \n\n(1.5 g/L), a concentration similar to the ones incorporated into CaP biomimetic coatings, at \n\n37 \u00baC up to 21 days. Lysozyme solution was changed every 7 days.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Water uptake and weight loss measurements \n\nAt the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately \n\nweighed for determination of water uptake (Equation 1) (Chapter V), washed thoroughly with \n\ndistilled water and dried for later calculation of weight loss (Equation 2) (Chapters III, V, VI, \n\nand VII): \n\n \n\nWater uptake (%) = [(ww \u2013 wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) \n\n \n\nWeight loss (%) = [wi \u2013 wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) \n\n \n\nwhere wi is the initial weight,  ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.6. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nThe morphology of the samples described in Chapters V and VI and CaP coatings \n\ndescribed in Chapter VI were mounted on aluminium stages, sputter with gold, and analysed \n\nby scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Leica Cambridge S-360, UK).  \n\n \n\n2.2.7. Thin-film X-Ray diffraction (TF-XRD) and Fourier Transformed infrared \n\nspectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nIn order to characterize the crystalline/amorphous nature of the CaP films described \n\nin Chapter VI, thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD, Philips X\u2019Pert MPD, The Netherlands) was \n\nused. The data collection was performed by 2? scan method with 1\u00ba as the incident beam \n\nangle using CuK? X-Ray line and a scan speed of 0.05\u00ba/min in 2?. In addition, Infrared \n\nanalysis (FTIR) of the coatings was performed in a Perkin- Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer \n\n1600 series equipment, USA) to examine the chemical structure of the obtained CaP \n\nbiomimetic coatings (Chapter VI). Coatings were scraped from the chitosan scaffolds, mixed \n\nwith KBr (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) and then formed into a disc in a press. All spectra were \n\nobtained between 4400 and 450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n63 \n\n2.2.8. Determination of lysozyme release and activity in solution  \n\nIn order to evaluate the lysozyme activity and release from the CaP coating at pH 5 \n\nand pH 7.4 (Chapter VI), the Micrococcus lysodeikticus assay was used. This assay is based \n\non the ability of lysozyme to hydrolyse the cell wall fragments of bacteria. For determining the \n\nactivity of released lysozyme, coated scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were immersed in \n\nbuffer solution (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 30 days. The released lysozyme (150 \u00b5L) \n\nwas added to a 100 \u00b5L of Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension (2.3 mg/mL, pH 7.4) in a 96-\n\nwell plate. The decrease in turbidity at 37 \u00baC was measured at 450 nm (Microplate Reader, \n\nSynergyTM HT, BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., USA) at 1 min intervals during 30 minutes. The \n\nsame procedure was used to determine the enzyme activity at pH 5 and pH 7.4. For that, \n\nknown enzyme concentrations were prepared in buffers at pH 5 and pH 7.4 and added to the \n\nbacteria suspension in the same buffer. The initial kinetic rate (OD slope at t = 0) was \n\nmeasured for each sample and a standard curve (lysozyme activity vs lysozyme \n\nconcentration) was constructed. The activity of the lysozyme released after 30 days was \n\ndetermined from the standard curve. \n\n \n\n2.2.9. Micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis \n\nThe porosity, pore interconnectivity, pore size, and 3D structures of SPCL fiber \n\nmeshes (Chapter III) and chitosan scaffolds (Chapter VII) were analyzed before and after in \n\nvitro degradation by microcomputed tomography (?-CT). \u00b5-CT was carried out with a high-\n\nresolution ?-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Data sets were \n\nreconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, \n\nSkyScan). Representative data sets were segmented with a dynamic threshold of 40-255 \n\n(grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) \n\nand to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis \n\nincluded porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. 3D virtual \n\nmodels of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created and registered \n\nusing both image processing software (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator).

Cell lines  \n\nFor biocompatibility assessment of the scaffolds studied in Chapter V, two different \n\ncell types were used: L929 (ECACC, European Collection of Cell Cultures), a mouse \n\nfibroblast cell line commonly used in cytotoxicity screenings, and SaOs-2 (ATCC, American \n\nType Culture Collection), a cell line derived from human osteosarcoma. L929 and osteoblast-\n\nlike SaOs-2 cell lines were selected because they are a model of a relevant cell type for the \n\nmedical application of the implant. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified \n\nEagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrome) and 1% \n\nantibiotic/antimicotic solution. In all the experiments cells were kept in an incubator at \n\nconstant temperature (37 \u00baC) and CO2 concentration (5%). \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Biocompatibility assays: extracts and cell adhesion studies \n\nBiocompatibility screening was performed according to ISO guidelines. Two \n\ncategories of in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate scaffolds developed in \n\nChapter V: extract and direct contact tests. The scaffolds, previously sterilized by ethylene \n\noxide, were immersed in complete culture medium for 24 h at constant temperature (37 \u00baC) \n\nand agitation (60 rpm). L929 cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (10,000 cells cm-\n\n2), in order to reach 80% confluence in 24 h. The extracts were filtered and placed in contact \n\nwith the monolayer of L929 cells for 72 h. A control, with cells grown in the presence of \n\ncomplete culture medium, was included. Afterwards, the viability test MTT was performed. \n\nBriefly, the culture medium was replaced by a solution of MTT and the cells were incubated \n\nfor 4 h. The viable cells, those with functional mitochondrial dehydrogenase, were able to \n\nreduce the yellow MTT into a purple formazan product. The end product was quantified by \n\nspectroscopy and the results expressed as percentage of cell viability. In the direct contact \n\ntest, scaffolds were seeded with L929 cells (8 x 104/50 ?l) and with osteoblast-like SaOs-2 \n\ncells (5 x 105 cells/ml) for 3 and 7 days. Prior to cell seeding, the chitosan/starch scaffolds \n\nwere immersed in DMEM culture medium overnight. This step is intended to reduce culture \n\nmedium uptake by the highly hydrophilic materials.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n65 \n\n3.2. Culture of rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) under static and flow perfusion \n\nconditions \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Isolation, expansion and seeding of rat MSCs \n\nRat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were harvested from the tibiae and femora of 41-44 \n\ndays old (151-175 g) male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using previously \n\nestablished methods [13]. Briefly, rats were euthanized using 4% isofluorane in CO2. The leg \n\nbones were excised, the soft tissue was removed and the leg bones were placed in \n\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 200 ?g/ml of penicillin \n\nstreptomycin fungizone antibiotic cocktail (PSF). This concentration of antibiotics is 4 times \n\ngreater than the normal concentration used in cell culture to avoid contamination during the \n\nharvest process. The proximal end of each femur and distal end of each tibia were clipped. \n\nAn 18-gauge needle was inserted into the hole in the knee joint in each bone, and the bone \n\nwas flushed with 5 ml of complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD, USA), 50 ?g/ml \n\ngentamicin, 100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-\n\nglycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone]. The resulting marrow pellet was broken up \n\nby trituration, and cell suspensions from all bones were combined in a centrifuge tube. The \n\ncells were plated in 75 cm2 flasks and cultured for 6 days in complete osteogenic media at 37 \n\n\u00baC  in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 to allow the expansion of the cells. \n\nMedium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove the non-adherent cell population. In the \n\ncase of Chapters III and VII, after 6 days, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged and \n\nresuspended in a known amount of medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a \n\nfinal concentration of 3x106 cells/ml. Cells were aliquoted into cryotubes for storage (~ 1 ml \n\ncell suspension/crytube). Each cryotube of cells was stored at -80\u00baC overnight and then \n\nstored in liquid nitrogen. A known amount of cells were thawed and plated in 75 cm2 culture \n\nflasks and cultured until confluence. At the end of this primary culture period, cells were lifted \n\nwith trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA), centrifuged and resuspended in a known \n\namount of medium. In the case of studies reported on Chapter IV, cells were not frozen. \n\nScaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium overnight and on the following day \n\nwere press fit into 6 or 8 mm diameter cassettes [for chitosan-based scaffolds (Chapter VII) \n\nand SPCL fiber meshes (Chapters III and IV), respectively]. Cassettes were placed into 6-\n\nwell plates. Then, chitosan-based scaffolds were seeded with 280,000 cells in 100 ?l and \n\nSPCL fiber meshes were seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of complete osteogenic \n\nmedium. Cells were allowed to attach for 2-3 hours before adding 10 ml of osteogenic \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n66 \n\nmedium to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the scaffolds were \n\nplaced in new 6-well plates:  \n\n \n\ni) for 7 and 15 days with 3 different media conditions: complete osteogenic media with \n\n(1) lipase (110 U/L) [14], (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L) [9, 14], or (3) without enzymes to study the \n\ndegradation of SPCL fiber meshes under conditions simulating those found in vivo. Media \n\nwere changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. This description \n\ncorresponds to static culture conditions in Chapter III. \n\n  \n\nii) static culture condition or in a flow perfusion bioreactor for 7 and 15 days with four \n\ndifferent media conditions in the presence of complete osteogenic media (1) without \n\nenzymes, with (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L) [10], (3) lipase (110 U/L) [14], or (4) ?-amylase and \n\nlipase in concentrations similar to those found in the human blood serum. Media were \n\nchanged every 2-3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. These studies were \n\nperformed with SPCL fiber meshes and are well described in Chapter IV. \n\n \n\niii) for 7, 15, and 20 days with complete osteogenic medium. Media were changed \n\nevery 3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. Chitosan scaffolds uncoated and \n\ncoated with CaP and with and without incorporated lysozyme were used in this study. The \n\nresults of this study are described in Chapter VII.  \n\n \n\nAt the end of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and \n\nrinsed with PBS solution. Three samples from each group were stored at -20 \u00baC in ddH2O \n\nuntil analyses were performed. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Analysis of cultured scaffolds \n\n3.2.2.1. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nAfter each time period, SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, \n\nwere washed twice in PBS and were immersed in PBS with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, \n\nInvitrogen, USA) for 45min for observation under laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss \n\nLSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Once inside the cells, calcein-AM is \n\nhydrolized by endogenous esterase into the highly negatively charged green fluorescent \n\ncalcein, which is retained inside the cytoplasm.  \n\nOther samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the scaffolds were \n\nwashed with PBS and dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, dried by \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n67 \n\nhexamethyldisilazane, mounted on aluminium stages, sputter with gold, and examined with \n\nan FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Hillsboro, OR, USA).  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. DNA analysis \n\nThe cells in the constructs were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in ddH2O. The \n\nDNA content of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (Picogreen, \n\nMolecular Probes) and correlated to a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. Frozen \n\nscaffolds were thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed to allow \n\ncellular DNA into solution. Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and placed in \n\neach well of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in \n\nconcentrations from 0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to \n\neach well of the 96-well plate. Picogreen dye solutions were prepared according to the \n\ninstructions of the manufacturer using reagents provided in the kit and added at 150 ?l/well. \n\nAll these procedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark \n\nroom, the fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments \n\nInc., Winooski, VT, USA) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor \n\nof 2.7 pg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity  \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an \n\nestablished protocol [15].  Briefly, all samples were prepared in triplicate and compared \n\nagainst p-nitrophenol standards. For the assay, 96-well plates were used. In each well 80 ?l \n\nof sample or standard, 20 ?l of buffer solution, and 100 ?l of substrate solution were added, \n\nand the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00baC. Each sample and standard was prepared in \n\ntriplicate. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of stop solution (0.3 N NaOH). The \n\nstandard curve was generated by preparing dilutions of p-nitrophenol (0-250 \u00b5M). \n\nAbsorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., \n\nWinooski, VT, USA) to determine the alkaline phosphatase activity per scaffold. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4. Calcium deposition measurements \n\nCalcium content in the scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium Kit (Diagnostic \n\nChemical Limited). After the ALP and DNA assays, a volume of 1N acetic acid equal to the \n\nvolume remaining in each well was added to each sample (final concentration of 0.5N), and \n\nthe plate was placed on an orbital shaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay \n\nreagent was added to 20 ?l of sample solution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To generate a \n\nstandard curve, serial dilutions of calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n68 \n\nAbsorbance was read at 650 nm in a spectrophotometric plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek \n\nInstruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The calcium deposition in each scaffold is reported as \n\n?g Ca2+. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance \n\n(FTIR-ATR) \n\nThe cell/scaffold constructs after 16 days of culture were analysed by FTIR-ATR. The \n\nscaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and \n\ndried at room temperature. All spectra were recorded using 64 scans and 4 cm-1 in a FTIR \n\nspectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, Shimadzu).  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.6. Histology (H&amp;E, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence) \n\nLight microscopy analysis was used to evaluate the morphological appearance and \n\ninfiltration of the bone marrow stromal cells and deposited matrix. Cultured samples were \n\nrinsed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin solution and embedded in HistoPrep freezing medium \n\n(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Frozen sections of ~10-15 ?m thickness were \n\nobtained using a cryostat (HM500, Microm, Walldorf, Germany) operating at -23 \u00baC and \n\nmounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and \n\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for histological evaluation. For visualization of \n\nmineralized tissue, additional sections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV \n\nfor 25 min and counterstained with 0.5% safranin O solution. Von Kossa stained sections \n\nwere observed using a light microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY) and attached \n\nvideo camera (3CCD Color Video Camera DXC-950P; Sony, Park Ridge, NJ). Mineral \n\ndeposition was also visualized in unstained sections under fluorescent light after adding \n\ntetracycline-HCl to the culture media at final concentration of 10 ?g/mL [1, 16]. All the \n\nhistological sections, except von Kossa stained sections were visualized using Olympus \n\nBX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera Olympus DP70 equipped \n\nwith a fluorescence lamp. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods \n\n\u00a0\n\n69 \n\n4. IN VIVO STUDIES \n\n \n\n4.1. Implant preparation \n\nIn Chapter VIII, scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm thick were \n\nused. All scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide gas for 14 h prior to implantation. One \n\nday before subcutaneous implantation surgery, the implants were removed from sterile bags \n\nand prewetted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in 24-well plates overnight under \n\nsterile conditions. The different experimental conditions evaluated in vivo were: chitosan \n\nscaffolds (Ch), chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS), CaP chitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP \n\nchitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme \n\n(CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS \n\n+ lysozyme). \n\n \n\n4.2. Subcutaneous implantation \n\nAll animal manipulations were approved by Rice University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care \n\nand Use Comitee. Twenty four male Wistar rats 41-44 days old (Charles River Laboratories, \n\nUSA) were used for subcutaneous implantation of acellular scaffolds. Three implantation \n\nperiods were used: 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Animals were anesthetized with a 4% \n\nisoflurane/oxygen mixture, which was reduced to 2% during surgical manipulation. The rats \n\nwere monitored to ensure that an appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained. \n\nPreviously, the dorsum of the rat was shaved. Then, the animals were placed in a ventral \n\nposition, the backs clipped and disinfected with povidone-iodine and six small longitudinal \n\nincisions were made. A pocket was created on each incision using blunt dissection, and one \n\nscaffold was placed in each pocket. One implant from each experimental condition was \n\nimplanted in twenty four rats (six implants per rat). Each rat received 6 implants, 1 from each \n\nexperimental group. A total number of 8 scaffolds per experimental group per time point were \n\nimplanted. Previous studies reported successfully implantation of 6 materials in rat dorsal \n\nsubcutaneous pockets using Wistar rats with similar or lower size [17-20]. The incisions have \n\nbeen closed with Vicryl 5-0 sutures. Each animal received a subcutaneous injection of sterile \n\nsaline to aid post-operative recovery (1 ml/100 g/hour of anesthesia). Each animal received \n\nalso a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) 8-12 hours after surgery. On \n\nthe following day, two additional doses of buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) have been injected \n\nfor continued post-operative analgesia (i.e. at 20-24 and 32-36 hours post-op). Once animals \n\nbecome active they returned to their cages. Animals were placed one per cage with water \n\nand food ad libitum. At each time point, animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n70 \n\nand euthanized with carbon dioxide inhalation. The implants were retrieved after a bilateral \n\nthoracotomy has been performed to ensure death.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Preparation of specimens for weight loss measurements and ?-CT \n\nAfter each implantation time, three scaffolds of each group condition were subjected \n\nto a decellularization process for weight loss measurement and micro-computed tomography \n\nanalysis. Briefly, the scaffolds were immersed in ddH2O and placed in 24-well plate at -20 \u00baC. \n\nAfter that, scaffolds underwent three freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and in a 37 \u00baC \n\nwater bath, respectively, to disrupt attached cells and remove cellular debris [15]. After this \n\nprocess scaffolds were air-dried in a laminar flow hood. \n\n \n\n4.4. Histological analysis \n\nAfter euthanasia, the implants were retrieved along with the surrounding tissue and \n\nhistologically processed. Five specimens of each group condition per time point were fixed in \n\n10% neutral buffered formalin until further processing. The specimens were dehydrated in \n\ngraded series of ethanol, immersed in infiltration solutions, embedded in Technovit glycol \n\nmethacrylate (kit 8100, Heraeus Kulzer, EBSciences, CO) and subsequently polymerized. \n\nThree specimens of each group condition per time period were cut to obtain longitudinal \n\nsections and two specimens were cut to obtain transverse sections of 7 ?m thickness using a \n\nmodified microtome equipped with a tungsten blade (Leica RM 2155). \n\nSections were stained with H&amp;E to evaluate the in vivo degradation, formation of pores and \n\ninfiltration of cells through the implants. For visualization of the CaP coating, additional \n\nsections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for 25 min and counterstained \n\nwith 0.5% safranin O solution (von Kossa staining). All images were obtained using Olympus \n\nBX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera Olympus DP70. Histological \n\nsections from all time points were scored by three observers (AMM, ARP and CMA) blinded \n\nfor group conditions and implantation time, and reached consensus on the final score. The \n\ncellular ingrowth within the implants and the degradation of each sample was qualitatively \n\nscored based on dissolution, cracks, fragmentation on a scale modified from De Jong as \n\nshown in Table 1 [21]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

The biodegradation profile of SPCL fiber meshes was investigated using \n\nenzymes that are specifically responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of SPCL using \n\nconcentrations similar to those found in human serum. These degradation studies were \n\nperformed using both static and dynamic conditions. After several degradation periods (3, 7, \n\n14, 21, and 30 days) weight loss measurements and micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) \n\nanalysis (specifically porosity, interconnectivity, mean pore size and fiber thickness) were \n\nperformed. The SPCL scaffolds were seeded with rat MSCs and cultured for 8 and 16 days \n\nusing complete osteogenic media with and without enzymes (?-amylase or lipase). Results \n\nindicate that culture medium supplemented with enzymes enhanced cell proliferation after 16 \n\ndays of culture as compared with samples cultured without enzymes. With respect to the \n\ncalcium content of the constructs, no calcium was detected in scaffolds cultured with ?-\n\namylase or without enzymes after each time period. However, SPCL scaffolds cultured with \n\nlipase presented calcium deposition after the 8th day, showing a significant increase at the \n\n16th day. Lipase appears to positively influence osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and to \n\nenhance matrix mineralization. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy images showed \n\nthat the enzymes do not have a deleterious effect on the 3D structure of SPCL fiber meshes, \n\nmeaning that the scaffolds after 16 days did not lose their structural integrity. Confocal \n\nmicrographs have shown cells to be evenly distributed and infiltrated within the SPCL fiber \n\nmeshes up to 410 ?m from the surface.

The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n80 \n\nculture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering \n\nconstructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber meshes, as lipase enhances the osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without deleteriously \n\naffecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. \n\n\u00a0\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nTissue engineering, as it was defined by Langer and Vacanti (1) in 1993, \u201cis an \n\ninterdisciplinary field of research that applies the principles of engineering and the life \n\nsciences towards the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve \n\ntissue function.\u201d Specific tissue engineering applications, such as bone regeneration, often \n\nneed a temporary scaffold with a three-dimensional architecture to support tissue growth. \n\nThe ideal scaffold should be biodegradable and bioresorbable to support the growth of new \n\nbone.  The scaffold degradation rate should complement the growth rate of the new bone in \n\na manner that, by the time the defect/injury site is completely regenerated, the scaffold is \n\ntotally degraded (1, 2). Biodegradable materials have the capacity to temporarily mimic the \n\noriginal structural function of the tissue and to degrade by controlled mechanisms into \n\nproducts easily eliminated by the body\u2019s metabolic pathways (3). In this perspective, we used \n\nenzymes present in human serum that are responsible for the enzymatic degradation of \n\nstarch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL) (?-amylase and lipase, respectively) in order to \n\nsimulate conditions found in vivo. In this study, we used SPCL, a blend of starch with poly(?-\n\ncaprolactone). Starch itself is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polymers, \n\npresenting a combination of attractive properties that is increasingly advancing its use in a \n\nvariety of applications. Starch-based biomaterials are biocompatible (4, 5) and biodegradable \n\n(6, 7). Studies with starch-based scaffolds showed that their degradation products do not \n\nhave a negative effect on human osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2 cell line) (8). Previous studies \n\nwith SPCL fiber meshes have also shown that these scaffolds were able to support the \n\nattachment, proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) (9, 10). \n\nBiomaterials based on starch degrade by ?-amylase. In principle, the in vivo resorption rate \n\nof blends based on starch can be regulated by controlling the percentage of starch in the \n\nmaterial, preferentially attacked by enzymatic hydrolysis. \n\nPCL is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester currently used in an array of biomedical \n\napplications. Several studies have reported that PCL is degraded by lipase (11-14). Lipases \n\nare water-soluble enzymes that hydrolyze ester bonds of water soluble substrates such as \n\ntriglycerides, phospholipids and cholesteryl esters (15, 16). The lipase gene family consists \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n\u00a0\n\n81 \n\nof multiple lipases that share a similar sequence structure at the genetic and protein level \n\nthus indicating a common ancestral origin. However, these lipases have disparate and organ \n\nspecific expression, indicating that they may have evolved relatively specific roles. The \n\nhuman lipases include the pre-duodenal lingual and gastric lipase and the extra-duodenal \n\npancreatic, hepatic, lipoprotein (LPL) and endothelial lipase (17). The pancreatic, hepatic, \n\nlipoprotein and endothelial lipase are members of the lipase gene family (17). Lipoprotein \n\nlipase has been described as a marker of adipogenic differentiation (18-20). Serum lipase is \n\nmainly derived from pancreatic cells, while other sources in the human body are the digestive \n\ntrack, adipose tissue, lung, milk and leucocytes (3, 21). Several authors have described \n\ndifferent enzymatic effects of lipase on PCL using species of lipase obtained from diverse \n\nsources (12, 13). The experimental results obtained with lipase seem to be influenced by \n\nenzyme characteristics such as source and specificity. Some studies have also reported that \n\nthe biodegradation rate of PCL depends on the shape and inherent surface/volume ratio of \n\nthe PCL substrate, with films being slowly degraded, while nano/microparticles are very \n\nquickly degraded (13).   \n\nPrevious studies using static and dynamic (flow perfusion bioreactor) culture \n\nconditions for rat marrow stromal cells on SPCL fiber meshes have shown that flow perfusion \n\nconditions enhance differentiation of marrow stromal cells with subsequent formation of a \n\nbone-like extracellular matrix (9, 10). Holtorf et al. (22) showed that flow perfusion culture \n\ninduced osteoblastic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells seeded on scaffolds, even in \n\nthe absence of dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid media supplement that promotes \n\nosteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells in culture).  \n\nIn this work we propose a novel approach, using static cultures and complete \n\nosteogenic media supplemented with enzymes to study simultaneously the influence of ?-\n\namylase and lipase on the degradation of SPCL fiber meshes as a function of immersion \n\ntime and on the osteodifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells. \n\nThis work intends to mimic in vitro the in vivo degradation of the SPCL fiber meshes \n\nusing enzymes responsible for their degradation at the same concentrations as those found \n\nin human serum. Besides characterizing the susceptibility of SPCL fiber meshes to \n\nenzymatic degradation, this study aims also to investigate the osteogenic differentiation of rat \n\nmarrow stromal cells (MSCs) and subsequent formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) under \n\nstatic conditions in the presence of hydrolytic enzymes (lipase or ?-amylase). By seeding rat \n\nMSCs onto SPCL fiber meshes and culturing them under static conditions using osteogenic \n\nmedia supplemented with lipase and ?-amylase enzymes, we aimed to answer the following \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n82 \n\nquestions: 1) What is the role of lipase and ?-amylase in the degradation of SPCL fiber mesh \n\nscaffolds? 2) Is the integrity of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds rapidly compromised by enzymatic \n\ndegradation, and if so, which enzyme is the most influential? 3) Is there any effect of ?-\n\namylase and lipase on the osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells? \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. Scaffolds preparation and characterization \n\nPorous scaffolds used in this study were based on a blend of corn starch and poly (?-\n\ncaprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70 %) prepared by a fiber bonding technique (9). Scaffolds were \n\ncylinders with 8 mm diameters and heights of 1-1.5 mm. Prior to cell seeding, scaffolds were \n\nsterilized by ethylene oxide gas for 14 hours. All chemical reagents were purchased from \n\nSigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. \n\n \n\n2.2. Degradation tests \n\nSerum ?-amylase and serum lipase in healthy adults are in range of 46-244 U/L (3, 23) \n\nand 30-190 U/L (3, 24), respectively. Degradation studies were carried out by incubating \n\nsamples in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (0.1M, pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase \n\n(150 U/L) (3, 23) from Baccillus sp. or lipase (110 U/L) (3, 24) from Aspergillus niger, both \n\nconcentrations similar to those found in human serum, and sodium azide (0.2%), to avoid \n\ncontaminations, at 37\u00baC up to 30 days under static and dynamic conditions (shaker at 70 \n\nrpm). The studies were performed in triplicate. The enzymatic degradation solutions were \n\nchanged every 7 days to restore the original level of enzymatic activity.  At the end of the \n\ndegradation period, the samples were removed, washed thoroughly with distilled water and \n\ndried in a graded series of ethanol for later calculation of weight loss (1). \n\n \n\n(1) Weight loss (%) = Initial weight \u2013 Final weight \n\n                                   Initial weight \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Micro-Computed  Tomography (?-CT) \n\nThe scaffolds (n=3) were analysed using micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) before \n\nand after degradation with both enzymes (lipase or ?-amylase) for the different periods of \n\nimmersion (0, 3, 14 and 21 days) in both static and dynamic conditions. ?-CT was carried out \n\nwith a high-resolution ?-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) using a \n\nresolution of pixel size of 8.79 ?m and integration time of 1.9 ms. The X-ray source was set \n\nat 40 keV of energy and 250 ?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired \n\nover a rotation range of 180\u00b0 with a rotation step of 0.45\u00b0. Data sets were reconstructed \n\nusing standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The \n\noutput format for each sample was 300 serial 1024x1024 bitmap images. Representative \n\ndata sets of 200 slices were segmented into binary images with a dynamic threshold of 40-\n\n255 (grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, \n\nSkyScan) and to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric \n\nanalysis included porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. \n\n3D virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, \n\nvisualized and registered using both image processing softwares (CT Analyser and ANT 3D \n\ncreator). \n\n \n\n2.4. Isolation and expansion of rat bone marrow stromal cells  \n\nRat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were harvested from the tibiae and femora of 41-44 \n\ndays old (151-175 g) male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using established \n\nmethods (25).  Briefly, rats were euthanized using 4% isofluorane in CO2. The leg bones \n\nwere excised, the soft tissue was removed and the leg bones were placed in Dulbecco's \n\nModified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 200 ?g/ml of penicillin streptomycin \n\nfungizone antibiotic cocktail (PSF). This concentration of antibiotics is 4 times greater than \n\nthe normal concentration used in cell culture to avoid contamination during the harvest \n\nprocess. The proximal end of each femur and distal end of each tibia were clipped. An 18-\n\ngauge needle was inserted into the hole in the knee joint in each bone, and the bone was \n\nflushed with 5 ml of complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD), 50 ?g/ml gentamicin, \n\n100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, \n\nand 10-8 M dexamethasone]. The resulting marrow pellet was broken up by trituration, and \n\ncell suspensions from all bones were combined in a centrifuge tube.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n84 \n\nThe cells were plated in 75 cm2 flasks and cultured for 6 days in complete osteogenic \n\nmedia at 37 \u00baC  in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 to allow the expansion of the \n\ncells. Medium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove the non-adherent cell population. \n\nAfter 6 days, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in a known amount of \n\nmedium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a final concentration of 3x106 cells/ml. \n\nCells were aliquoted into cryotubes for storage (~ 1 ml cell suspension/ crytube).  Each \n\ncryotube of cells was stored at -80\u00baC overnight and then stored in liquid nitrogen.  \n\n \n\n2.5. Cell seeding \n\nA known amount of cells were thawed and plated in 75 cm2 culture flasks and \n\ncultured until confluence. At the end of this primary culture period, cells were lifted with \n\ntrypsin solution (0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA), centrifuged and resuspended in a known \n\namount of medium. \n\nSPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium overnight \n\nand were pressed fit into 8 mm diameter cassettes on the following day. Cassettes were \n\nplaced into 6-well plates. Then, SPCL scaffolds were seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of \n\ncomplete osteogenic medium. Cells were allowed to attach for 3 hours before adding 10 ml \n\nof osteogenic medium to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the \n\nscaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates for 7 and 15 days with 3 different media \n\nconditions: complete osteogenic media with (1) lipase (110 U/L), (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L), or \n\n(3) without enzymes to study the degradation of SPCL fiber meshes under conditions \n\nsimulating those found in vivo. Media were changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n \n\n= 6 samples.  \n\n \n\n2.6. DNA analysis \n\nThe cells in the cell/scaffold constructs were lysed by freeze-thaw in ddH2O. The DNA \n\ncontent of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (Picogreen, Molecular \n\nProbes) and correlating to a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. Frozen scaffolds \n\nwere thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed to allow cellular \n\nDNA into solution.  Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and placed in each \n\nwell of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in concentrations from \n\n0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to each well of the 96-\n\nwell plate. Picogreen dye solutions were prepared according the instructions of the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

All these \n\nprocedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark room, the \n\nfluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., \n\nWinooski, Vermont) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor of 2.7 \n\npg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. \n\n \n\n2.7. Alkaline phosphatase activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined using an established protocol \n\n(26) by measuring the conversion of p-nitrophenylphosphate to p-nitrophenol. All reagents \n\nwere purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For the assay, 96-well plates were used. In \n\neach well 80 ?l of sample or standard, 20 ?l of buffer solution, and 100 ?l of substrate \n\nsolution were added, and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00baC. Each sample and \n\nstandard was prepared in triplicate. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of stop \n\nsolution (0.3 N NaOH). The standard curve was generated by preparing dilutions of p-\n\nnitrophenol (0-250 \u00b5M). Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader to determine \n\nenzyme concentration per construct. \n\n \n\n2.8. Calcium deposition measurement \n\nCalcium content in the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium \n\nKit (Diagnostic Chemical Limited). After the ALP and DNA assays, a volume of 1N acetic \n\nacid equal to the volume remaining in each well was added to each well (final concentration \n\nof 0.5N), and the plate was placed on an orbital shaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of \n\ncalcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample solution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To \n\ngenerate a standard curve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance \n\nwas read at 650 nm in a spectrophotometric plate reader.

Depth projections of the surface (up to 410 ?m) were obtained and the cells were \n\ncolored as a function of their distance from the surface. \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the morphological \n\nappearance of the rat bone marrow cells. Samples for SEM analysis were washed twice in \n\nPBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Degradation studies \n\nThe main aims of the degradation studies were to simulate physiological conditions \n\nusing enzymes present in human serum that would be responsible for enzymatic hydrolysis \n\nof SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds in vivo, to control and tailor the degradation rate of the SPCL \n\nscaffolds, and finally to evaluate the possibility of increasing their porosity and pore \n\ninterconnectivity through degradation.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n\u00a0\n\n87 \n\nSPCL is a blend of starch with poly(?-caprolactone). In this study, scaffolds based on \n\nSPCL were prepared by a fiber bonding process that uses heat to promote the bonding of \n\nthe fibers previously obtained by melt-spinning (9).  \n\nWhen analysing weight loss profiles using ?-amylase and lipase, few differences \n\nwere observed between static and dynamic conditions for each enzyme (Figure 1). One of \n\nthe enzymes responsible for starch hydrolysis is ?-amylase. The scaffolds immersed in ?-\n\namylase presented the highest weight loss as compared with lipase. In presence of this \n\nenzyme it was observed after 3 days a weight loss of approximately 25%, which slightly \n\nincreases to 30% weight loss upon 30 days of immersion (Figure 1). Nevertheless, \n\nimmersion periods up to 30 days did not cause the scaffolds to lose their structural integrity. \n\nThese observed results are in agreement with previous studies using ?-amylase (3, 7).  \n\nLipase is an enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of ester bonds in polyesters, and \n\nsome studies have shown that lipase enhances PCL degradation (7, 27, 28). PCL is a \n\nhydrophobic crystalline polymer that degrades very slowly in vitro in the absence of enzymes \n\nand in vivo as well. The in vitro degradation can be enhanced in the presence of the enzyme \n\nlipase (28). The values of weight loss in the presence of lipase are not so pronounced \n\ncompared with those obtained in presence of ?-amylase but these values are in agreement \n\nwith other studies (27). Weight loss remains constant up to 21 days, slightly increasing after \n\nafterward (Figure 1). The enzymatic degradation of PCL by lipase has been reported by \n\nseveral studies (11-14, 29). It is apparent from Figure 1 that the degradation of SPCL occurs \n\nin the presence of lipase, this enzyme being responsible for only 7.7 ? 1.6 % weight loss \n\nafter 30 days of immersion under dynamic conditions. These results are in accordance with \n\nseveral published studies (12, 13). Hoshino et al. (12) showed the influence of different \n\ncommercially available lipases on degradation of PCL. They presented the results of \n\nbiodegradability of PCL films after 100 days incubation at 37\u00ba C and some commercial lipase \n\nspecies were able to degrade PCL completely, namely from alcaligenes sp., Rhizopus \n\nniveus, Rhizopus oryzae, Chromobacterium viscosum and Candida rugosa. However, they \n\npresented different results with other lipases that showed values of weight loss below 5%, as \n\nwhen using the same lipase employed in this study - Aspergillus niger. These results are in \n\naccordance with the weight loss after 30 days reported here. In contrast to its slow hydrolytic \n\ndegradation, other studies with PCL showed high values of weight loss during enzymatic \n\ndegradation when using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase, which has a specific activity on PCL \n\nsegment degradation (14).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n88 \n\nIt is obvious that ?-amylase and lipase contributed to different degrees to the \n\ndegradation of the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds and the studies presented here with ?-amylase \n\nshow that this enzyme is responsible for higher values of weight loss as compared to the \n\nones obtained with lipase (Figure 1).   \n\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. Weight loss profile (pH 7.4, 37\u00baC) of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds using ?-amylase (150 U/L) \n\nand lipase (110 U/L) under static and dynamic conditions up to 30 days. \n\n \n\nThe morphological changes induced by degradation with these enzymes can be \n\nfurther confirmed by virtual 3D models obtained by ?-CT, where it can be seen that SPCL \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds were affected by ?-amylase and lipase (Figure 2). However, as \n\nconfirmed by weight loss results, ?-amylase had a great effect in SPCL fiber meshes mainly \n\nat day 21 (Figure 2K) and day 30 (Figure 2F and 2L).   In Figure 3, it is possible to observe \n\nthe 3D virtual models obtained by ?-CT as a function of immersion time in PBS using lipase \n\nsolution.  The effect of lipase is not so pronounced as compared with images obtained after \n\ndegradation with ?-amylase, nevertheless slight changes in SPCL fiber meshes were \n\nobserved as a function of immersion time (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

Porosity results (Figure 4A) show that both enzymes \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

When lipase was used a significant increase in porosity was observed as a \n\nfunction of immersion time using dynamic conditions compared with control samples. \n\nFurthermore, a significant difference in porosity was obtained using lipase and dynamic \n\nconditions compared to results obtained with the same enzyme using static conditions. \n\nLipase seems to be influenced by agitation (dynamic conditions) as seen in Figure 4A, the \n\nporosity increases when compared with both control samples and static conditions. In \n\naddition, no effect of lipase upon SPCL porosity using static conditions was observed. \n\nIn contrast with results obtained with lipase, ?-amylase has a significant effect on \n\nSPCL degradation using either static or dynamic conditions (Figure 4A). Moreover, results \n\nwhen ?-amylase was used, show that all time periods (except day 30 using dynamic \n\nconditions) under static or dynamic conditions presented a significant increase in porosity \n\nwhen compared with control samples (Figure 4A). The effect of ?-amylase on porosity seems \n\nto be independent of using static or dynamic conditions, being obvious when analysing \n\nFigure 4A. When comparing results obtained after degradation with lipase or ?-amylase for \n\nthe same period of time, a significant increase in porosity was observed only for the 3rd and \n\n7th day using ?-amylase in static conditions. Some differences can be observed between \n\nstatic and dynamic conditions for both enzymes: the positive effect of lipase on the porosity \n\nof the scaffolds is higher for dynamic conditions, while the effect of ?-amylase on porosity \n\nappears to be less dependent on the circulation (static/dynamic) of the degrading media \n\n(Figure 4A).  \n\nThe interconnectivity of SPCL scaffolds before degradation is very high (around \n\n97%), and for all periods, the interconnectivity increases both under static and dynamic \n\nconditions with ?-amylase (Figure 4B), although such differences are not easily perceptible \n\nthrough visual inspection due to the high range of interconnectivity. The same trend was \n\nobserved for lipase (Figure 4B), and no significant differences were observed. However, the \n\ninterconnectivity when ?-amylase or lipase was used seems to be influenced by dynamic \n\nconditions. \n\nThe average pore size also increases upon degradation with lipase. According to \n\nporosity results (Figure 4A) the same trend is observed for pore size when lipase is used \n\n(Figure 5A). The pore size increase upon degradation with lipase is more pronounced for \n\ndynamic conditions (Figure 5A), being significantly different when compared with control \n\nsamples or static conditions (Figure 5A). In this respect, dynamic conditions enhance the \n\nsize of the pores (Figure 5A) relative to static conditions. As observed in Figure 4A, static \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes and the \nOsteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  \n\n92 \n\nconditions seem to not interfere with the size of pores when lipase was used (Figure 5A).  \n\nThe pore size of the scaffolds increases upon degradation with ?-amylase as compared with \n\ncontrol samples, however this difference is only significant for the 7th and 14th day either \n\nusing static or dynamic conditions. A significant increase in pore size is also observed when \n\n?-amylase was used in static conditions when compared with lipase (7th and 14th day).  \n\nThe thickness of the fibers remains more or less constant using lipase (Figure 5B), \n\nwhich supports the low weight loss observed for lipase degradation media (Figure 1).  No \n\nsignificant differences are observed between static or dynamic conditions. ?-amylase \n\ndecreases the thickness of the fibers both using static and dynamic conditions compared \n\nwith control samples as a function of time. It is evident that fiber diameter decreases upon \n\ndegradation with ?-amylase, however differences between static and dynamic conditions are \n\nnot significant, except for the 3rd day of degradation using dynamic conditions. Comparing the \n\naction of lipase and ?-amylase on fiber thickness, it is possible to observe a significant \n\ndecrease when lipase was used under either static or dynamic conditions. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The alkaline phosphatase expression showed highest values at \n\nday 8 of culture for all conditions (Figure 8). According to Figure 8, ALP activity without \n\nenzymes (control) is significantly higher than in groups with enzymes. Usually a maximum \n\nvalue of ALP coincides with early osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells. There \n\nwas a significant difference between the scaffolds cultured with and without enzymes for \n\neach time period. The presence of each enzyme decreased the ALP activity with respect to \n\nthe control. All conditions presented a decrease of ALP at day 16, which was expected as \n\nafter this period, ALP activity usually decreases and mineralization starts to take place (9). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-\n\nATR) \n\nIn this study, FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from SPCL cultured for 16 days under \n\nstatic conditions with and without enzymes (?-amylase or lipase). This method was used as \n\na complement to the calcium assay.  When ?-amylase or lipase were added to osteogenic \n\nmedia, it was possible to see  bands centered at 1650 and 1542 cm-1 that can be attributed \n\nto amide I and amide II. The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of C=O bonds \n\nin the backbone of the proteins (33).  Furthermore, the amide II band arises from the \n\ncombination of C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of the protein backbone (33). \n\nAnalysing the spectra when enzymes were added to culture media, it is possible to detect \n\namide I and amide II bands, which confirms that these enzymes were able to adsorb to the \n\nSPCL fiber mesh surfaces. In addition, these bands can be correlated to the protein matrix \n\nformation. Moreover, phosphate bands located at 1020 cm-1 similar to the ones found in \n\ncarbonate apatite were observed in SPCL fiber meshes cultured with lipase, clearly \n\nsuggesting the presence of mineralized extracellular matrix and corroborating the results \n\nobtained from the calcium assay. \n\n \n\nFigure 12.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis study demonstrates the effect of lipase and ?-amylase on degradation of SPCL \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds, showing that after 30 days these enzymes did not have a negative \n\neffect on SPCL fiber integrity. The positive effect of lipase on the porosity and size of pores \n\nwas clearly visible when dynamic conditions were used. Porosity, pore size and fiber \n\nthickness were also enhanced by ?-amylase. However, no significant differences were \n\nobserved under static and dynamic conditions, when ?-amylase solution was used. SPCL \n\nfiber meshes cultured with media supplemented with ?-amylase or lipase revealed that these \n\nenzymes promoted the proliferation of rat marrow stromal cells. Furthermore, this study \n\nconfirms by calcium content measurement and FTIR analysis that lipase has a superior \n\neffect in osteodifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells and promotes extracellular matrix \n\nmineralization when added to osteogenic culture medium as compared with results obtained \n\nwithout enzymes or with ?-amylase.  These results demonstrate that supplementation of \n\nculture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering \n\nconstructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds, as lipase enhances the \n\nosteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without \n\ndeleteriously affecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Helena Azevedo and Dr. Serena Danti.

This study investigated the effect of flow \n\nperfusion bioreactor culture in combination with enzymes such as ?-amylase and lipase on \n\nthe osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs. SPCL fiber meshes were seeded with rat MSCs \n\nand cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with ?-amylase, lipase or a combination \n\nof the two for 8 or 16 days using both static or fluid flow perfusion conditions. It was found \n\nthat lipase and its combination with ?-amylase enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days.  In \n\naddition, the flow perfusion culture enhanced the infiltration of cells and facilitated greater \n\ndistribution of extracellular matrix throughout the scaffolds in the presence/absence of \n\nenzymes. A significant amount of calcium was detected after 16 days in all groups cultured in \n\nflow perfusion conditions compared with static cultures. Nevertheless, when ?-amylase and \n\nlipase were included in the flow perfusion cultures, the calcium content was 379 \u00b1 30 \n\n?g/scaffold after as few as 8 days. The highest calcium content (1271 \u00b1 32 ?g/scaffold) was \n\nobtained for SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the presence of lipase and flow. \n\nFurthermore, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence of histological sections \n\ndemonstrated mineral deposition within the scaffolds for all groups cultured for 16 days under \n\nflow perfusion conditions.

INTRODUCTION \n\nAn ideal scaffold for bone tissue engineering should be biodegradable and \n\nbioresorbable while being able to support the growth of new bone.  The scaffold degradation \n\nrate should complement the growth rate of the new bone  such that the scaffold degrades in \n\ntime for the new bone to occupy the site of defect or injury.1 In the case of starch and poly(?-\n\ncaprolactone)  (SPCL) scaffolds2,3, ?-amylase4-8 and lipase5,9,10  have been shown to facilitate \n\nthe enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch and PCL components of the scaffold, respectively. \n\nAdditionally, studies have also shown pronounced degradation of SPCL biomaterials when \n\nlipase and ?-amylase were used together.5,6 Since these enzymes are naturally present in \n\nhumans, lipase and ?-amylase were used in this study at human blood serum concentrations \n\nto simulate in vivo conditions. In vitro, these enzymes have previously induced the \n\ndegradation of SPCL scaffolds under static as well as dynamic conditions, as is indicated by \n\nthe enhanced porosity and pore size of the scaffolds. In addition, the presence of these \n\nenzymes in culture media has induced the proliferation of rat marrow stromal cells cultured \n\non SPCL scaffolds.  \n\nIn this study we were interested in examining the osteogenic potential of ?-amylase \n\nand lipase when added to osteogenic culture media in flow perfusion culture of MSCs. The \n\nosteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro starts with a period of cellular proliferation, \n\nfollowed by extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and maturation, and ultimately \n\nmineralization of the matrix.11,12 To induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, the culture \n\nmedium is typically supplemented with osteogenic agents such as ascorbic acid, ?-\n\nglycerophosphate, and dexamethasone. To further facilitate osteogenesis, growth factors \n\nsuch as BMP-2 and BMP-4 have been added to culture media.  However, most studies do \n\nnot take into account the effect of physiological enzymes on cellular differentiation and \n\nscaffold degradation; two events that are integral to designing successful strategies for bone \n\ntissue engineering. For example, a previous study in our laboratory described that lipase \n\npositively influences osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and enhances matrix \n\nmineralization under static conditions when added to osteogenic culture medium. Previous \n\nstudies with SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds using flow perfusion bioreactors have shown that \n\nflow perfusion conditions enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal \n\ncells (MSCs)2,3 due to the improved mass transport to the scaffold interior13 and to the \n\nmechanical stimulation of cells caused by the fluid shear force within the scaffold.14 \n\nDue to previous promising results indicating the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs  \n\nin the presence of lipase under static conditions, it was hypothesized in the present study \n\nthat the addition of mechanical stimulation of MSCs via fluid flow in the bioreactor would \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Specifically, this study was designed to investigate the \n\nfollowing: (1) The efficacy of ?-amylase and/or lipase enzymes as osteogenic supplements in \n\nculture media for osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and (2) the effect \n\nof lipase and ?-amylase at physiological concentrations, in combination with flow perfusion \n\nconditions, on the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. Scaffold preparation  \n\nBlends of corn starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70%) fiber mesh scaffolds \n\nwere prepared by a fiber bonding technique with a porosity of 60 \u00b1 3% and an average fiber \n\ndiameter of 226 \u00b1 1 ?m. The porosity and fiber diameter were determined using micro-\n\ncomputed tomography (?-CT) as previously described.8 The average pore size was 339 \u00b1 31 \n\n?m.8 Scaffolds were die-punched into 8 mm diameter discs (thickness = 1-1.5 mm). Further \n\ndetails on the scaffolds can be found elsewhere.2,3 Prior to cell seeding, scaffolds were \n\nsterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide gas for 14 hours. All chemical reagents were \n\npurchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise specified. \n\n \n\n2.2. Isolation, expansion and seeding of rat bone marrow stromal cells  \n\nRat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were obtained from femura and tibiae of 41-44 \n\nday-old male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using the method described by \n\nManiatoupoulos et al.15 The harvested cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with \n\n5% CO2 at 37\u00baC until they were confluent. Medium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove \n\nthe non-adherent cell population.  \n\nSPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM \n\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, \n\nMD, USA), 50 ?g/mL gentamicin, 100 ?g/mL ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/mL L-\n\nascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone] overnight and were \n\npress fit into 8 mm diameter cassettes on the following day. Cassettes were placed into 6-\n\nwell plates. Each scaffold was seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of complete osteogenic \n\nmedium as described previously.8 Cells were allowed to attach for 2 hours before adding 10 \n\nml of osteogenic medium to each well of the 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Combination of Enzymes and Flow Perfusion Conditions Improves Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow \nStromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes \n\n108 \n\nscaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates (static culture condition) or in a flow perfusion \n\nbioreactor for 7 and 15 days with four different media conditions; specifically, complete \n\nosteogenic media (i) without enzymes, (ii) with ?-amylase (150 U/L)8,16, (iii) with lipase (110 \n\nU/L)8,17, or (iv) with ?-amylase and lipase in concentrations similar to those found in human \n\nblood serum. \n\nMedia were changed every 2-3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. At the \n\nend of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and rinsed with \n\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Three samples from each group were stored at -\n\n20\u00baC in ddH2O for biochemical analysis. The remaining samples were fixed with 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis or with 10% formalin \n\nsolution for histological evaluation.  \n\n \n\n2.3. DNA analysis \n\nThe cells in the constructs were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in ddH2O. The \n\nDNA content of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, \n\nMolecular Probes) and correlated to DNA from a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. \n\nFrozen scaffolds were thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed \n\nto allow cellular DNA into solution.  Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and \n\nplaced in each well of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in \n\nconcentrations from 0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to \n\neach well of the 96-well plate. PicoGreen dye solutions were prepared according to the \n\ninstructions of the manufacturer using reagents provided in the kit and added at 150 ?l/well. \n\nAll these procedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark \n\nroom, the fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments \n\nInc., Winooski, VT, USA) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor \n\nof 2.7 pg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. \n\n \n\n2.4. Alkaline phosphatase activity \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an \n\nestablished protocol.18  All samples were prepared in triplicate and compared against p-\n\nnitrophenol standards. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of 0.3 N NaOH. \n\nAbsorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., \n\nWinooski, VT, USA) to determine the alkaline phosphatase activity per scaffold. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Combination of Enzymes and Flow Perfusion Conditions Improves Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow \nStromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes \n\n \n\n109 \n\n2.5. Calcium deposition measurement \n\nCalcium content in the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium \n\nKit (Diagnostic Chemical Limited, Oxford, CT, USA). After the ALP and DNA assays, a \n\nvolume of 1 N acetic acid equal to the volume remaining in each well was added to each \n\nsample (final concentration of 0.5 N), and the plate was placed on an orbital shaker \n\novernight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample \n\nsolution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To generate a standard curve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 \n\nwere prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance was read at 650 nm using a spectrophotometric \n\nplate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The calcium deposition \n\nin each scaffold is reported as ?g Ca2+. \n\n \n\n2.6. Histological and microscopic analysis \n\nAfter each time period, SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, \n\nwashed twice in PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the scaffolds \n\nwere washed with PBS and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, dried by \n\nhexamethyldisilazane, mounted on aluminium stages, sputter coated with gold, and \n\nexamined with an FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Hillsboro, \n\nOR, USA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy were used to evaluate \n\nthe morphological appearance and infiltration of the bone marrow stromal cells and \n\ndeposited matrix. The samples for SEM observation were cut in half for analysis of both the \n\ntop and bottom; additionally, cross-sections were cut. The samples were sputter-coated with \n\ngold, examined and photographed with an FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscope (Hillsboro, OR, USA). \n\nThe remaining cultured samples were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin solution \n\nand embedded in HistoPrep freezing medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). \n\nFrozen sections of ~10-15 ?m thickness were obtained using a cryostat (HM500, Microm, \n\nWalldorf, Germany) operating at -23 \u00baC and mounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides \n\n(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for \n\nhistological evaluation. For visualization of mineralized tissue, additional sections were \n\nexposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for 25 min and counterstained with 0.5% \n\nsafranin O solution. von Kossa stained sections were observed using a light microscope \n\n(Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) and attached video camera (3CCD Color Video \n\nCamera DXC-950P; Sony, Park Ridge, NJ, USA). Mineral deposition was also visualized in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Statistics \n\nResults of DNA, ALP, and calcium assay are expressed as mean ? standard \n\ndeviation with n = 3 for each group. Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to \n\ndetermine statistical significance within a data set. If ANOVA detected a significant difference \n\nwithin the data set, Tukey\u2019s honestly significantly different (HSD) multiple comparison test \n\nwas used to determine significant differences between groups and conditions. All tests were \n\nconducted with a confidence interval of 95% (p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. DNA assay \n\nA significant improvement in cell number was generally observed in flow perfusion \n\nconditions when compared with static cultures (Figure 1). SEM images and H&amp;E stained \n\nsections also confirm these results (Figures 2, 3 and 4). The SPCL/cell constructs cultured \n\nwithout enzymes or with ?-amylase in flow perfusion conditions reached their peak \n\ncellularities at day 8, and after that point they demonstrated a significant decrease in the \n\nnumber of cells measured in each scaffold (Figure 1), in agreement with previous \n\nexperiments.2,3 In contrast, the DNA results showed an increase in cell numbers after 16 \n\ndays for SPCL scaffolds cultured with lipase or with both enzymes. Scaffolds cultured in the \n\npresence of lipase or with both enzymes, under flow conditions after 16 days, had almost 3 \n\nand 2 times higher cellularity, respectively, when compared with SPCL/cell constructs \n\ncultured for 16 days under flow conditions without enzymes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Microscopic analysis \n\nCross-sections of all groups were visualized using SEM to evaluate cell morphology \n\nand infiltration and deposition of extracellular matrix. Culturing the constructs in a flow \n\nperfusion bioreactor enhanced the infiltration of MSCs for all groups (Figure 3). Previous \n\nstudies have also demonstrated that flow perfusion culture increased the distribution and \n\ninfiltration of cells as compared with static culture.2,19-21 This was further confirmed by \n\nhistological evaluation of the scaffolds (Figure 4).  The cellular distribution observed in static \n\nas well as flow conditions was not influenced by the presence of the enzymes. Cross-\n\nsectional images of all groups cultured under flow perfusion conditions revealed infiltration of \n\ncells through the bottom of the scaffolds and the presence of matrix between fibers deeper \n\nwithin the scaffolds (Figure 3) as compared to constructs that were cultured statically (Figure \n\n2). Furthermore, SEM images indicated that the enzymes did not have a deleterious effect on \n\nthe structure of SPCL fiber meshes, meaning that the constructs did not loose their structural \n\nintegrity after 16 days, even when flow perfusion conditions and enzymes were used (Figure \n\n3). This was further confirmed with histological cross sections, which additionally showed that \n\nthere were no observable differences between scaffolds cultured in flow conditions with \n\nrespect to the distribution and infiltration of cells (Figure 4).  \n\n \n\n* * \n\n#\n*, **\n\n#\n*, **\n\n#\n\n*, #\n\n0\n\n500000\n\n1000000\n\n1500000\n\n2000000\n\n2500000\n\n3000000\n\n3500000\n\nWithout enzymes Alpha-amylase  Lipase  Alpha-amylase and\nlipase \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\nc\ne\nll\n\ns\nStatic 8 days\nStatic 16 days\nFlow 8days\nFlow 16 days\n\n* * \n\n#\n*, **\n\n#\n*, **\n\n#\n\n*, #\n\n0\n\n500000\n\n1000000\n\n1500000\n\n2000000\n\n2500000\n\n3000000\n\n3500000\n\nWithout enzymes Alpha-amylase  Lipase  Alpha-amylase and\nlipase \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\nc\ne\nll\n\ns\nStatic 8 days\nStatic 16 days\nFlow 8days\nFlow 16 days\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Alkaline phosphatase activity \n\nALP is considered to be an early stage marker of osteogenic differentiation.12 \n\nTypically a rise and fall of ALP activity is characteristic of osteoblastic differentiation.2,3 \n\nHowever, ALP can be expressed at high levels near the end of the proliferative period and \n\nduring the period of extracellular matrix deposition and maturation.12 Such a trend is \n\nobserved in Figure 5, where all groups cultured under flow conditions, with the exception of \n\nSPCL/cell constructs supplemented with both enzymes, had a significant increase of ALP \n\nactivity at day 16. The highest peak of ALP activity was observed for SPCL/cell constructs \n\ncultured without enzymes in flow perfusion conditions. The ALP activity was normalized to \n\nreflect the ALP activity per cell. Results show significant differences between flow perfusion \n\nand static cultures for complete osteogenic media without enzymes, with ?-amylase and with \n\nlipase. Flow significantly enhanced the ALP activity for all groups, with the exception of \n\nSPCL/cell constructs cultured with ?-amylase and lipase. There was no apparent positive \n\neffect of adding enzymes to culture media on ALP activity implying that the influence of \n\nenzymes predominantly affected the later osteoblastic differentiation, as characterized by \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Calcium deposition measurement \n\nThe calcium content in scaffolds is an indication of the production of mineralized \n\nmatrix and a marker of the late-stage osteoblastic differentiation of cells.11,14  Even in static \n\ncultures, there was a significant increase in the mineralization of SPCL/cell constructs in the \n\npresence of either enzyme between day 8 and 16. It has been previously reported that lipase \n\nenhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs under static conditions.8 A similar increase in \n\ncalcium deposition under static conditions with ?-amylase was observed in the present study \n\nas well, although a combination of the enzymes failed to produce a similar increase in \n\ncalcium deposition. The calcium data were corroborated by SEM images where it is possible \n\nto see the cross-sections of the constructs and the enhanced distribution of MSCs and ECM \n\nthroughout the constructs when flow perfusion bioreactors were used (Figure 3). In flow \n\nperfusion conditions, the mineralized matrix content of all groups (with or without enzyme \n\nsupplementation) cultured for 16 days was greatly increased over those cultured in static \n\nconditions (Figure 6).

Combination of Enzymes and Flow Perfusion Conditions Improves Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow \nStromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes \n\n \n\n115 \n\nSPCL cultured without enzymes (907 \u00b1124 ?g/scaffold). In addition, SPCL/cell constructs \n\ncultured in flow perfusion bioreactors with both enzymes (?-amylase and lipase) showed \n\nsignificantly greater calcium deposition at 8 days when compared with other groups.  The \n\ncalcium data were further corroborated by SEM images, where cross-sections of the \n\nconstructs showed deeper and more extensive distribution of mineralized ECM throughout \n\nthe constructs when flow perfusion bioreactors were used (Figure 3). \n\nOne of the objectives of this study was to examine the efficacy of the enzymes in \n\ninducing osteogenic differentiation. The literature indicates that besides being responsible for \n\npoly(?-caprolactone) degradation, lipase plays an important role in osteoblastic differentiation \n\nof rat bone marrow stromal cells when added to culture media.8 Under flow perfusion \n\nconditions and in the presence of lipase, SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the \n\npresent study showed the highest amount of calcium (1271 \u00b1 32 ?g/scaffold). However, the \n\ncalcium content of SPCL/cell constructs cultured under flow perfusion condition with culture \n\nmedium supplemented with both enzymes (?-amylase and lipase) was 737 \u00b1 25 ?g/scaffold, \n\nonly slightly higher than that obtained with culture medium supplemented with ?-amylase. \n\nThis indicates that the presence of ?-amylase does not enhance the deposition of calcium \n\nand therefore the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Furthermore, ?-amylase does not \n\nappear to improve the cellularity of MSCs on the SPCL constructs. Considering these results, \n\nit can be hypothesized that the lower calcium amount could be related to the lower cell \n\nnumber obtained with cellular scaffold constructs treated with ?-amylase. The decrease in \n\ncell number observed with ?-amylase could be attributed to the loss of surface area of SPCL \n\nfiber scaffolds, due to the dissolution of starch present within the scaffold in the presence of \n\n?-amylase. It has been previously shown that SPCL scaffolds, which are a blend of 30% \n\nstarch and 70% PCL, undergo significant weight loss in the presence of ?-amylase.8 A \n\nweight loss of approximately 25% was observed between day 7 and 14 in ?-amylase, which \n\nwas significantly greater than the weight loss observed in the presence of lipase alone. This \n\nstudy indicated that the weight loss in the presence of ?-amylase was mainly due to the \n\npartial degradation and release of starch present in the SPCL scaffolds. Moreover, when \n\nSPCL/cell constructs were cultured under flow and in the presence of ?-amylase, the number \n\nof cells was lower when compared with the other groups. For this condition, the calcium data \n\nreflected a lower degree of mineralization. One possible explanation could be related to the \n\ndegradation of starch by ?-amylase after 16 days of culture under flow conditions. Previous \n\ndegradation studies with ?-amylase showed a pronounced weight loss of approximately 25% \n\nafter 3 days which increased slightly to 30% after 30 days.8 Since SPCL is a blend of 30% \n\nstarch and 70% poly(?-caprolactone), this weight loss might be related with the degradation \n\nof starch.  Based on this hypothesis, ?-amylase does not have a negative effect on \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

The von Kossa stained sections of all \n\ngroups cultured for 16 days demonstrated that flow perfusion had a positive effect in the \n\ndeposition of extracellular matrix, in agreement with the previous results.2 \n\nTetracycline is a fluorochrome-labeling agent for bone tissues.22 Tetracycline \n\naccumulates at bone forming sites and fluoresces brightly when activated with fluorescent \n\nlight.  Figure 8 indicates numerous regions in the interior of the scaffolds from all groups \n\ncultured under flow conditions where mineral deposition has occurred after 16 days in \n\nculture. In contrast, minimal tetracycline fluorescence appeared in scaffolds cultured under \n\nstatic conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, tetracycline fluorescence shows that mineral \n\nwas more evenly distributed within the scaffold when the constructs were cultured in flow \n\nconditions, whereas constructs cultured statically had fluorescence limited to the outer edges \n\nof the scaffold. As noted previously, Figure 8A and Figure 8C show an enhanced distribution \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Osteogenic culture \n\nmedium supplemented with lipase did not only stimulate enhancement of mineralized matrix \n\ndeposition (Figure 6) but also generated mineralized extracellular matrix that was distributed \n\nthroughout the porosity of the scaffolds (Figures 7C and 8C). Lipase is a molecule previously \n\nshown to be capable of directing osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs cultured statically.8 \n\nThis work corroborates these previous findings and further shows that lipase promotes the \n\nosteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs, especially when coupled with flow perfusion culture. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis work demonstrates that osteogenic media supplemented with ?-amylase, or with ?-\n\namylase and lipase together, and cultured in flow perfusion bioreactors did not enhance \n\nosteoblastic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells compared with SPCL/cell constructs \n\nwithout enzymes. However, it was observed that SPCL fiber mesh scaffold/MSC constructs \n\ncultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with lipase under flow perfusion were more \n\nmineralized than the other groups examined, which indicates late-stage osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation of MSCs. This study demonstrates that lipase and flow perfusion conditions act \n\nas effective osteogenic stimuli in the differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells, also \n\npromoting the production of mineralized extracellular matrix. This strategy of using scaffolds \n\nthat are enzymatically degraded by enzymes naturally present in the human blood serum, \n\ntogether with demonstrated improvement of osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs by lipase \n\nunder flow perfusion conditions shows promising results for bone tissue engineering \n\napplications. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Scaffolds with three \n\ndifferent compositions were developed: chitosan (C100) and chitosan/starch (CS80-20, \n\nCS60-40). Compressive tests results showed that these materials exhibit very promising \n\nmechanical properties, namely a high modulus in dry and wet state. The compressive \n\nmodulus in dry state for C100 was 580\u00b133 MPa, CS80-20 (402\u00b162 MPa) and CS60-40 \n\n(337\u00b178 MPa). Degradation studies were performed using ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at \n\nconcentrations similar to those found in human serum, at 37 \u00baC up to 90 days. SEM \n\nmicrographs showed that after enzymatic degradation there was the formation of a porous \n\nstructure, indicating the potential of this methodology to obtain in situ forming scaffolds. In \n\norder to evaluate the biocompatibility of the scaffolds, extracts and direct contact tests were \n\nperformed. Results with MTT test showed that the extracts of the materials were clearly non-\n\ntoxic to L929 fibroblast cells. Analysis of cell adhesion and morphology of seeded \n\nosteoblastic-like cells in direct contact tests, at day 7, showed that the number of cells on \n\nCS80-20 and CS60-40 was noticeably higher than that on C100, which suggests that starch \n\ncontaining materials may promote cell adhesion and proliferation.

INTRODUCTION \n\nTissue engineering has recently emerged as a new interdisciplinary science to repair \n\ninjured body parts and restore their functions by using laboratory-grown tissues, materials \n\nand artificial implants. An ideal scaffold to be used for bone tissue engineering should \n\npossesses characteristics of excellent biocompatibility, adequate pore size, controllable \n\nbiodegradability and suitable mechanical properties 1-3. The choice of the appropriate \n\nfabrication technique is critical because it can significantly influence the properties of the \n\nimplant and its degradation characteristics. There is, therefore, an increasing need to look for \n\nnew materials and methodologies to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. One \n\ninteresting possibility is to develop an in vivo responsive scaffold which properties may be \n\nregulated by the bone regeneration process, with gradual formation of pores in situ and \n\nconsequent resorption. This hypothesis seems to be very promising due the control of \n\ndegradation in situ and consequent pore formation, which allows to have scaffold with the \n\nrequired mechanical properties in the initial stage of implantation.  \n\nOne of the present trends in implantable applications requires materials that are \n\nderived from nature. Natural origin materials have been demonstrated to promote healing at \n\na faster rate and are expected to exhibit greater compatibility with human tissues. The \n\ncombination of chitosan with other materials appears to be a common theme in a various \n\nreports 4,5. Chitosan is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine and \n\nit is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. The degree of deacetylation (DD) represents the \n\nproportion of D-glucosamine units with respect to the total number of units. DD is a structural \n\nparameter which influences physicochemical properties 6 such as solubility, crystallinity, \n\nswelling behavior and  biological properties 6, namely the biodegradation by lysozyme 7,8, the \n\nwound healing properties 9 and the osteogenesis enhancement 10. One of the interesting \n\nfeatures of chitosan is its cationic nature, resulting from primary amine groups, thus forming \n\nwater-insoluble ionic complexes with a variety of a polyanionic substances. It is normally \n\ninsoluble in aqueous solution above pH 7. However, in diluted acids (pH &lt;6), the free amino \n\ngroups are protonated and polymer becomes soluble. Chitosan has been applied to induce \n\nthe extracellular matrix formation in tissue regenerative therapy 11. The degradation of \n\nchitosan in the human body has been reported to be carried out by lysozyme 7,8. The \n\ndegradation kinetics appears to be inversely related to degree of deacetylation 8,12. \n\nLysozyme, or muramidase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan \n\nlayer of bacterial cell walls. Human lysozyme is found in various body fluids in concentrations \n\nfrom 7 to 13 mg/l13-15  in serum and from 450 to 1230 mg/l in tears13,14, saliva13,14 and other \n\nfluids including those surrounding cartilage 16. Following implantation of a biomaterial, \n\nneutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages will be present around the foreign material \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n127 \n\nin both the acute and chronic phases of inflammation. A number of enzymes, such as \n\nlysozyme, and reactive species will be released from these cells. \n\nBiodegradable starch-based polymeric biomaterials have been studied and proposed \n\nfor a wide range of biomedical applications. Starch is one of the most abundant naturally \n\noccurring polymers, presenting a combination of properties that is steadily increasing its uses \n\non several technologies. Starch is a natural polymer that presents excellent characteristics to \n\nbe applied in the biomaterials field, which are mainly low toxicity17,18, biodegradability19, \n\nbiocompability20,21. It is inexpensive and above all reusable. The main enzymes involved in \n\nstarch degradation are ?-, ?-, amylase, glucosidase and other debranching enzymes. Starch \n\nis hydrolysed to glucose, maltose and dextrin. It is well known that salivary amylase is \n\ninvolved in the gastric and intestinal digestion of starch in food components. Amylase can \n\nalso be found in human serum. \n\nThe aim of this work was to develop a biodegradable matrix, based in chitosan and \n\nnative starch, that will form a porous structure in vivo by the preferential attack of the matrix \n\nby specific enzymes present in the human body (namely the ?-amylase and lysozyme). The \n\ninclusion of an enzymatically degradable phase in biomaterials may constitute an interesting \n\napproach to obtain scaffolds with adequate mechanical properties and with a gradual in situ \n\npore forming ability. Using this innovative methodology, the developed scaffolds can exhibit \n\nvery promising mechanical properties, due the inexistence of macroporosity, at the initial \n\nstage of implantation. The porosity will be formed in situ by enzymes present in human body.  \n\nIn this work, chitosan/starch scaffolds were developed by using a precipitation \n\nmethod. These systems were analyzed in terms of morphology, degradation behavior and \n\nmechanical properties. This study also addressed the effect of leachables from developed \n\nscaffolds on the viability of mouse fibroblasts and the influence of the constructs surface on \n\nthe morphology, adhesion and spreading of fibroblast and human osteoblasts. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nChitosan with DD of 92% (determinated by the titration method as described in 22) and \n\nnative corn starch were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \n\nand sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) were supplied from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) ?-amylase \n\nfrom Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was obtained by Genencor International, Inc. (Rochester, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n128 \n\nNY, USA); egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from \n\nSigma (St. Louis, USA). \n\n \n\n2.2. Scaffolds preparation \n\nChitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution (C100). \n\nThen, using the same procedure other formulations were prepared with the following ratios: \n\n80/20 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS80-20) and 60/40 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS60-40). \n\nThe solutions were casted into moulds and frozen (-18\u00baC) overnight. They were then \n\nimmersed in a precipitation solution (25% NaOH 1M and 75% Na2SO4 0.5M) overnight, \n\nadapted from Tuzlakoglu et al.23. After precipitation, the samples were washed repeatedly \n\nwith distilled water to remove excess of salts, dried at 37\u00baC and followed by successive \n\nwashings for 5 days until no pH changes were detected.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Degradation studies \n\nDegradation studies were carried out by incubating the scaffolds in phosphate \n\nbuffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L15,24) and/or lysozyme \n\n13 mg/L13-15), at concentrations similar to the ones found in human serum, at 37\u00baC up to 90 \n\ndays. A control was also performed by incubating the samples in buffer alone. At the end of \n\nthe degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately weighed for \n\ndetermination of water uptake, washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried for later \n\ncalculation of weight loss. Degradation solutions were also analyzed to measure the \n\nconcentration of reducing sugars, released into the solution as result of starch hydrolysis by \n\n?-amylase, using the dinitrosalicylic acid method. \n\n \n\n2.4. Analysis of sample morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nThe cross-sections morphology, before and after degradation, was observed by \n\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a Leica Cambridge S360. All samples were \n\npreviously coated with a gold layer (Fisons Instruments, Sputter Coater SC502, UK). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n129 \n\n2.5. Mechanical properties \u2013 compression tests \n\nThe mechanical properties of the materials were evaluated on compression tests \n\ncarried out in the dry and wet state in an Instron 4505 universal mechanical testing machine \n\nat a controlled environment (23\u00baC and 55% RH). The cross-head speed was 2 mm/min until \n\n1% strain. \n\n \n\n2.6. Cell lines used for biocompatibility testing  \n\nFor biocompatibility assessment of the different formulations of the developed \n\nscaffolds two different cell types were used: L929 (ECACC, European Collection of Cell \n\nCultures), a mouse fibroblast cell line and SaOs-2 (ATCC, American Type Culture \n\nCollection), a cell line derived from human osteosarcoma. L929 is a cell line commonly used \n\nin cytotoxicity testing and osteoblast-like SaOs-2 cells were chosen because they are a \n\nmodel of a relevant cell type for the medical application of the implant. Both cell lines were \n\ncultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, Sigma, St Louis, USA), \n\nsupplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Biochrome) and 1% \n\nantibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma, St. Louis, USA).  In all the experiments cells were kept \n\nin an incubator at constant temperature (37\u00baC) and CO2 concentration (5%). \n\n \n\n2.7. Biocompatibility evaluation: extracts and cell adhesion studies   \n\nIn the scope of biocompatibility assessment, and according to ISO norms, two \n\ncategories of in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed: extract and direct contact tests. The \n\nscaffolds, previously sterilized by ethylene oxide, were extracted in complete culture medium \n\nfor 24h at constant temperature (37\u00baC) and agitation (60 rpm). L929 cells were seeded in 96 \n\nwells cell culture plates (10 000 cells/cm2), in order to reach 80% confluence in 24h. The \n\nextracts were filtered and placed in contact with the monolayer of L929 cells for 72hrs. A \n\ncontrol, with cells grown in the presence of complete culture medium, was included. \n\nAfterwards, the viability test MTT was performed. Briefly, the culture medium was replaced \n\nby a solution of MTT and the cells were incubated for 4 hrs. The viable cells, those with \n\nfunctional mitochondrial dehydrogenase, were able to reduce the yellow MTT into a purple \n\nformazan product. The end product was quantified by spectroscopy and the results \n\nexpressed as percentage of cell viability. \n\nIn direct contact test, the developed scaffolds were seeded with L929 cells (8x 104/50 \n\n\u00b5L) and with osteoblast-like cells (5x105 cells/mL), for 3 and 7 days. Prior to cell seeding, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n130 \n\nchitosan/starch scaffolds were immersed in culture medium overnight. This step intends to \n\nreduce culture medium uptake by the highly hydrophilic materials. After each time point, the \n\nsamples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, critical point dried and gold sputtered \n\nfor SEM observation. \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Characterization of the scaffolds morphology \n\nIn this work, degradable scaffolds based on chitosan and native corn starch were \n\ndeveloped aimed to be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Three different \n\ncompositions were prepared and tested. Figure 1 shows the interior morphology of the \n\nobtained scaffolds. C100 material exhibits a smooth surface (Figure 1A), whereas in the \n\nmicrographs of CS80-20 and CS60-40 scaffolds (Figure 1B and 1C) it is possible to observe \n\nthat the starch granules are homogenously distributed along the chitosan matrix, as well its \n\nincorporation in the chitosan matrix. Starch granules have dimensions from 0.5 to 175 \u00b5m 25 \n\nthat is main dependent from its origin. SEM micrographs (Figure 1B and 1C) shows that \n\nstarch granules from native corn starch have dimensions from 5-10 \u00b5m. The proposed \n\nprocessing technique is based in a precipitation solution. This technique was used with the \n\naim of promoting the ionic complexation. This precipitation method does not allow to obtain a \n\nmacroporous structure (Figure 1). The macroporosity will be formed in situ by human \n\nenzymes present in human serum.   \n\n \n\nFigure 1. SEM micrographs of the developed scaffolds (transversal sections) before degradation: \n\nC100 (A), CS80-20 (B) and CS60-40 (C). The scale bar is 50 \u00b5m and applies to all images. \n\n \n\n3.2. Degradation behavior  \n\nThe main aim of these degradation studies, using ?-amylase and lysozyme with \n\nsimilar concentrations to the ones found in human serum, is to simulate the physiological \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n131 \n\nconditions and subsequent pore formation. It is expected that this innovative methodology \n\nwill induce the formation of pores. The pore size and its distribution in the scaffold can be \n\ncontrolled by the location of the \u2018sacrifice\u2019 phase (native starch) that will also control the \n\nwater uptake behavior due to the different hydrophilic nature of the materials. The hypothesis \n\nof this work is related with the formation of pores due to the degradation induced by specific \n\nenzymes ubiquitous in the human body. After implantation it is expect that a porous structure \n\nwill formed in situ allowing the penetration of the cells deep into these scaffolds. \n\nConcerning the water uptake in PBS, the C100 scaffolds present the highest \n\nhydration degree, of about 140% (Figure 2). The ability of a material to keep water and its \n\nwater permeability are important parameters to be studied, since it will influence the \n\nabsorption of body fluids and the transfer of cell nutrients and metabolites through the \n\nmaterials. The diffusity of nutrients is a very important parameter since in an in vivo situation, \n\na porous structure will be formed, induced by enzymes present in human body allowing the \n\npenetration of cells deep into the scaffolds. As expected, the water uptake of CS80-20 and \n\nCS60-40 is lower than C100, which is due to the presence of starch that is less hydrophilic \n\nthan chitosan (Figure 2). The weight loss in PBS was not significant (data not shown). The \n\nhighest weight loss was observed in CS60-40. This fact can be explained by the presence of \n\nstarch granules that are physically distributed. These results suggest that different \n\npercentages of starch influence the degradation rate.  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nTime  (days)\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr \n\nu\np\n\nta\nk\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nC100\n\nCS80-20\n\nCS60-40\n\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Water uptake of scaffolds as a function of immersion time in PBS (pH 7.4, T = 37\u00ba C). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n132 \n\n  All scaffolds were sectioned to observe the interior morphology and formation of \n\npores induced by enzymes at similar concentrations to those found in human serum. By SEM \n\nobservation it was detected, as expected, the attack of the native starch phase (CS80-20 and \n\nCS60-40) (Figures 3C and 3D) in the presence of ?-amylase. It was also observed that ?-\n\namylase induced the formation of pores in C100 material (Figures 3A and 3B). It was also \n\nreported by Muzzarelli et al. 26 that ?-amylase was able to attack the chitosan material.  \n\nIn the presence of lysozyme, it was possible to detect the preferential attack of C100 \n\n(Figure 3E) since this enzyme is able to hydrolyse chitosan in some extend. It is expected \n\nthat, when the scaffolds will be implanted in the body, the chitosan would be degraded \n\ngradually by lysozyme and then reabsorbed.  Lysozyme is known to be ubiquitous in the \n\nbody13,27. The main advantage of biodegradable over non-biodegradable materials is the \n\ndisappearance of implanted foreign materials which might elicit foreign body reactions from \n\nthe host\u2019s defence system during their long term contact with a living structure. Since \n\nlysozyme is present in cellular lysosomes and lysosomal rupture is associated with \n\ninflammation, it has been assumed that the source of the increased lysozyme activity is the \n\nrelease of enzyme from the lysossomes of phagocytic cells28. When any material is \n\nimplanted an acute inflammatory response will occur, and it is known in this situation the pH \n\nvalues will decrease and high levels of lysozyme are secreted to the surround medium. \n\nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that the initial degradation rate of chitosan at pH 4.5 \n\nis about five times higher than the rate at pH 7.014.  The results obtained in this work showed \n\nthe attack of C100 by lysozyme and the consequent pore formation.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n133 \n\n \n\nFigure 3. SEM micrographs showing the morphology of chitosan-based scaffolds after 14 days in PBS \n\nwith ?-amylase solution (A-C100, C- CS80-20, D- CS60-40); after 30 days in same solution (B- C100); \n\nafter 14 days in PBS with lysozyme solution (E- C100, F- CS80-20) and in the same period in PBS \n\nwith ?-amylase and lysozyme solution (G-C100, H-CS60-40). \n\n \n\n In order to investigate the effect of an enzyme cocktail, containing ?-amylase and \n\nlysozyme together, on the overall degradation rate of the materials, as well as on the type of \n\nporosity obtained, the materials were also simultaneously incubated with these enzymes. \n\nAnalysing the results presented in Figure 4 it is possible to observe that CS60-40 showed the \n\nhighest weight loss, when compared with CS80-20 and C100. The higher susceptibility of \n\nCS60-40 to enzymatic degradation may be related with the presence of a higher surface \n\narea for preferential attack, due to the interface between the two components. SEM \n\nmicrographs (Figures 3G and 3H) show that after enzymatic degradation there is the \n\nformation of a porous structure. Some studies showed that pore sizes less than 15-50 \u00b5m \n\nresult in fibrovascular ingrowth, pore sizes of 50-150 \u00b5m encourage osteoid formation, and \n\npore sizes greater than 150 \u00b5m encourage the ingrowth of mineralized bone29. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n134 \n\nSince the formation of pores in the presence of lysozyme was not so pronounced \n\ncompared to those obtained with ?-amylase or the two enzymes together (?-amylase and \n\nlysozyme) these studies must be improved. One possible alternative could be the \n\nincorporation of lysozyme in higher concentrations at the surface of these materials. It might \n\nbe adequate to enhance the in vivo performance using a CaP coating since these materials \n\nitself are not osteoconductive/osteoconductive. Several papers report the incorporation of \n\nenzymes or bioactive agents into CaP coatings in order to promote their degradation and/or \n\ntheir osteoconductive/osteoinductive potential30-32. It is expected also that in an in vivo \n\nsituation the pore formation will occur more rapidly, due the inflammatory response that \n\ndecreases the pH and also because high levels of lysozyme will be released by several cells \n\nsuch as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages.  \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nTime (days)\n\nW\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n\nlo\ns\ns\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nC100 CS80-20 CS60-40\n\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Weight loss of chitosan/starch scaffolds as function of time in PBS with ?-amylase (150 U/L) \n\nand lysozyme (13 mg/L) (pH 7.4, T = 37\u00ba C). \n\n \n\nAfter enzymatic degradation it was observed the formation of a porous structure, \n\nindicating the potential of this methodology to obtain \u201csmart\u201d in vivo forming scaffolds for \n\nbone tissue engineering applications. \n\nThe in vitro pore formation in the presence of enzymes at the similar concentration to \n\nthose found in human plasma is clear. It is expected that in an in vivo situation the pore \n\nformation will occur more rapidly, due to the presence of other enzymes and cells.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n135 \n\n3.3. Mechanical properties \n\nA hard material, with a high initial mechanical strength and an adequate degradation \n\nrate, is normally required for bone tissue engineering applications. The results of the \n\ncompressive tests showed that these materials exhibit very interesting mechanical properties \n\nin the dry and even in the wet state. The highest compressive modulus was observed for \n\nC100 (580\u00b133 MPa) in the dry state. For CS80-20 and CS60-40, the compressive moduli in \n\nthe dry state were 402\u00b162 MPa and 337\u00b178 MPa, respectively (Figure 5). The values found \n\nare higher than the typical values presented for chitosan-based materials. The modulus \n\ndecreased with increasing amounts of starch present in the scaffolds. This can be due to the \n\npoor adhesion between the phases, since it is a physical mixture, i.e., the \u2018sacrifice\u2019 phase is \n\nacting as nucleation site for fracture propagation. In the wet state, it was observed the same \n\ntendency, but the values were lower, as it was expected (C100: 107\u00b115 MPa, CS80-20: \n\n53\u00b13 MPa and CS60-40: 31\u00b11 MPa) (Figure 5). The mechanical properties exhibited by the \n\nscaffolds in the wet state fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus for trabecular \n\nbone  which are about 0.02-0.5 GPa 1,3 for compressive modulus and 2-12 MPa 1,3 for \n\nstrength.  \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\nC100 C80-20 CS60-40\n\nM\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n\n) \n\nDry Wet\n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Cytotoxic assessment of the extracts \n\nIn order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the substances that leach out of the developed \n\nscaffolds the viability assay (MTT test) was performed. This test is based on mitochondria \n\nviability, where only functional mitochondria can oxidize an MTT solution, giving a typical \n\nblue-violet end product.  Figure 6 shows that for CS80-20 and CS60-40 the percentage of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n136 \n\nviable cells was around 100%, thus comparable to the control. On the other hand, the value \n\nof viable L929 cells in contact with C100 leachables was lower (75%). MTT assay suggested \n\nthat the extracts from the developed scaffolds, produced by precipitation method, were non-\n\ntoxic towards mouse fibroblasts.   \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n%\n C\n\ne\nll\n\n V\nia\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\nC100\n\nCS80-20\n\nCS60-40\n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Cell morphology evaluation \n\nThe absence of cytotoxicity, however, does not confer knowledge about the \n\nbiocompatibility of a biomaterial33. In order to verify if the developed scaffolds support the \n\nfunctions shared by many cell types such as membrane integrity, adhesion to surfaces and \n\nreplication, adhesion studies with the cell line L929 were performed. At the end of 7 days, \n\nregardless of the scaffold formulation, all constructs were covered with a monolayer of cells \n\n(Figure 7). The fibroblasts had a typical spindle-shape morphology and exhibited \n\ncytoplasmatic projections strongly attached to the scaffolds. Only in CS80-20 there were \n\nsome rounded cells denoting that they were in an earlier adhesion step (Figure 7B). L929 \n\ncells were able to adhere, spread filopodia and stretch over the surface of the developed \n\nscaffolds. The slight toxicity of C100 extracts detected in MTT assay did not have any \n\nnegative effect on the ability of L929 cells to adhere and spread on the surface of the \n\nconstruct. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n137 \n\n \n\nFigure 7. SEM micrographs of the developed scaffolds surfaces, C100 (A and D), CS80-20 (B and E) \n\nand CS60-40 (C and F), before cell culture (A-C) and after 7 days of culture with L929 cells (D-F). \n\n \n\nCellular attachment and migration of osteoblast cells over the bone substituting \n\nmaterial surface are essential to obtain effective wound filling and bone tissue adaptation34. \n\nFor that, osteoblast-like cells were seeded on C100, CS80-20 and CS60-40 and the \n\nadhesion profile, as well as cell morphology was documented by SEM. On day 3 of culture, \n\nSEM examination revealed osteoblasts aggregates sparsely distributed over the surface of \n\nC100 (Figure 8A). At the same time point, the amount of cells attached to the surface of \n\nCS80-20 was higher, although cells did not cover the entire surface of the scaffold (Figure \n\n8B). Figure 8C shows the surface of CS60-40 covered by a compact monolayer of \n\nosteoblasts just after 3 days of culture. At this time point is quite notorious the differences \n\nbetween the chitosan scaffold (C100) and the chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS80-20 and CS60-\n\n40). The same trend was observed at the end of 7 days. On the C100 scaffold the growth \n\nwas limited to some restricted areas and probably these areas were the result of the \n\nexpansion of the cellular aggregates seen after 3 days (Figure 8D). On the other hand, in \n\nchitosan-starch scaffolds (CS80-20 and CS60-40) the surface was homogenously covered \n\nby a multilayer of osteoblast-like cells (Figures 8E and 8F). \n\nCell adhesion and spreading are influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of \n\nthe underlaying solid surface35. CS80-20 and CS60-40 supported in the same extent the \n\nadhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts. However, SaOs-2 behaved in a different way on the \n\nsurface of C100 scaffold. The poorer spreading on C100 maybe related with the higher \n\nchitosan content that renders the surface more hydrophilic. This impairs the adsorption of \n\nserum proteins and consequently cell adhesion35. Another explanation to the difference \n\nbetween the starch blended scaffolds and chitosan scaffold could be the topography. A \n\nhigher level of roughness appears capable of enhancing osteoblast adhesion and \n\nsubsequent proliferation and differentiation36. The starch granules present in CS80-20 and \n\nCS60-40 increase the roughness of the surface and therefore improve cell growth and \n\nattachment (Figures 8E and 8F). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nScaffolds based on chitosan and starch were developed and characterised to be used \n\nin bone tissue engineering applications. The results of the compressive tests showed that \n\nthese materials exhibit very promising mechanical properties in dry and wet state. After \n\nenzymatic degradation there was the formation of a porous structure, indicating the potential \n\nof this methodology to obtain \u201csmart\u201d in situ forming scaffolds. These \u201csmart\u201d scaffolds, with \n\nin situ pore forming capability and interesting mechanical properties, seem to be \n\nadvantageous when compared with other conventional materials. Regarding the \n\nbiocompatibility studies, the extracts of the developed scaffolds were not toxic and \n\nconcerning the osteoblast attachment, CS80-20 and CS60-40 showed to be a better \n\nsubstratum than C100. These results indicate that the incorporation of starch has a \n\nfavourable affect in the interaction with osteoblasts.    \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n139 \n\nThis combination of properties seems to be a very promising approach to obtain \n\nscaffolds with gradual in situ pore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThis work was supported by the European NoE EXPERTISSUES (NMP3-CT-2004-500283), \n\nthe European STREP HIPPOCRATES (NMP3-CT-2003-505758), and the Portuguese \n\nFoundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through POCTI and/or FEDER programmes. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

In order to prove the concept of in situ pore \n\nformation, the coated scaffolds (with and without lysozyme) were incubated in two different \n\nsolutions at different pH to simulate normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and \n\ninflammatory response (pH 5). The weight loss and morphology of the scaffolds was \n\nmonitored over time. At pH 7.4, the scaffolds remained more stable than at pH 5. The \n\nscaffolds incubated at pH 5 showed a rapid decrease in their initial weight and scanning \n\nelectron microscopy imaging revealed the formation of a highly porous structure. \n\nFurthermore, evaluation of the activity of the incorporated lysozyme revealed that the \n\nenzyme was able to hydrolyse the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell walls (as detected by the \n\ndecrease in optical density with time), indicating that the enzyme remained active after being \n\nincorporated into the CaP coating. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1 This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nA.M.

Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n146 \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nA novel concept in tissue engineering which proposes in situ pore-forming scaffolds \n\nhas been reported previously1. Chitosan has been considered a promising material for tissue \n\nengineering applications. It is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-\n\nglucosamine, derived from chitin by a deacetylation reaction. The degree of deacetylation \n\n(DD) measures the percentage of glucosamine units in the polymer chain and influences its \n\nphysicochemical properties such as solubility, crystallinity, and swelling behavior and \n\nbiological properties2, namely osteogenesis enhancement3. The degradation kinetics appear \n\nto be inversely related to the DD4. It has been demonstrated that chitosan is degraded in vitro \n\nand in vivo by lysozyme4,5, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body6,7. Lysozyme can attack \n\ncell wall polysaccharides of different bacterial species, especially Gram-positive bacteria, \n\nleading to rupture of the cell wall and killing of the micro-organism8,9. This study proposes the \n\nincorporation of the lysozyme enzyme into calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, prepared on \n\nthe surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of \n\ncontrolling their degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since \n\nlysozyme has antibacterial properties, these coatings may act as a carrier for its sustained \n\nrelease, preventing infection upon implantation. An improvement in the osteoconductivity of \n\nimplants has been achieved by coating their surfaces with CaP layers10-12. The biomimetic \n\nmethodology for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite layer has been described in \n\nseveral publications13-17. This technique mimics natural biomineralization processes, \n\ninvolving controlled crystal nucleation and growth control over the phase of the mineral \n\ndeposited18. The main advantage of the biomimetic methodology is the use of physiological \n\nconditions (pH 7.4 at 37 \u00baC) simulating the manner in which apatite is formed in bone. \n\nMoreover, this technique allows the incorporation of proteins and bioactive agents into CaP \n\ncoatings without compromising their activity19-22. An ideal material for the purpose of a \n\ntemporary support for bone replacement should feature an adequate range of mechanical \n\nproperties with convenient degradation kinetics, bone-bonding behavior and biocompatible \n\nperformance23. \n\nIn order to enhance the formation of pores in situ, chitosan scaffolds coated with CaP \n\nlayers and lysozyme incorporated into the coatings were developed, presenting properties \n\nthat promote degradation and osteoconductive potential. Lysozyme enzyme was \n\nincorporated into CaP coatings on the surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a \n\nbiomimetic route13,14,22. Moreover, CaP coatings enhance the osteoconductive properties of \n\nthe chitosan scaffolds. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n147 \n\nThis study was designed to answer the following questions: Can a hydrolytic enzyme be \n\nincorporated at the surface of chitosan scaffolds without compromising its activity? Is it \n\npossible to develop a non-porous scaffold with in situ pore-forming ability? How many days \n\ndoes it takes to have a porous scaffold in situ fully interconnected simulating in vivo \n\nconditions? \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nChitosan with a DD of 92% and medium molecular weight was obtained from Sigma \n\n(St. Louis, USA). Bioglass? 45S5 with the following composition: 45 SiO2, 24.5 CaO, 24.5 \n\nNa2O and 6.0 P2O5 (in wt.%)  was supplied by NovaMin Technology Inc. (Alachua, FL). \n\n \n\n2.2. Preparation of chitosan scaffolds \n\nChitosan scaffolds were prepared as previously described by Martins et al.1. Briefly, \n\nchitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution. Then, the \n\nsolution was casted into polyethylene moulds and frozen (-18\u00baC) overnight. After that, they \n\nwere  immersed in a precipitation solution (25% NaOH 1M and 75% Na2SO4 0.5M) overnight, \n\nadapted from the method developed by Tuzlakoglu et al.24. After precipitation, the samples \n\nwere washed several times with distilled water and dried at 37 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n2.3. Preparation of CaP biomimetic coatings \n\nThe method of preparing the CaP coatings was based on the methodology previously \n\ndeveloped by Abe et al.13 and adapted by Reis et al.14,15 consisting in impregnation of the \n\nmaterials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? 45S5, followed by immersion in a simulated \n\nbody fluid (SBF, 37 \u00baC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human blood \n\nplasma. Prior to the coating process, chitosan scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide. \n\nBioglass? 45S5 was sterilized by immersion in ethanol solution (70% v/v) and then dried \n\ninside the hood. All the subsequent work was performed under sterile conditions in a hood. \n\nBriefly, chitosan scaffolds were rolled in a wet bed of Bioglass? 45S5. After that, the scaffolds \n\nwere immersed in a 1.0 SBF solution, without (control) and with lysozyme (1 g/L) from \n\nchicken egg white (Fluka, USA), for 7 days at 37 \u00baC, a period known as the nucleation stage, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n148 \n\nwhich allows CaP nuclei formation. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with \n\ndistilled water and immersed in a concentrated 1.5 SBF solution for 3, 7 and 14 days at 37\u00baC, \n\nin order to enhance CaP nuclei growth. All the solutions were sterilized by filtration prior to \n\nuse. After each time period, chitosan scaffolds were washed with distilled water and dried \n\nuntil surface characterization was performed. The morphology of the CaP coatings obtained \n\nwas analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Leica Cambridge S-360, UK). Prior to \n\nmicrostructure analysis, specimens were coated with gold using a Fisons Instruments Coater \n\n(Polaron SC 502, UK). In order to characterize the crystalline/amorphous nature of the films, \n\nthin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD; Philips X\u2019Pert MPD, The Netherlands) was used. Data \n\ncollection was performed by 2? scan method with 1\u00ba as the incident beam angle using CuK? \n\nX-Ray line and a scan speed of 0.05\u00ba/min in 2?. In addition, infrared analysis (FTIR) of the \n\ncoatings was performed in a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 1600 series \n\nequipment, USA) to examine the chemical structure of the CaP biomimetic coatings \n\nobtained. Coatings were scraped from the chitosan scaffolds, mixed with KBr (Riedel-de \n\nHa\u00ebn, Germany) and then formed into a disc in a press. All spectra were obtained between \n\n4400 and 450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Degradation studies \n\nIn order to simulate in vivo conditions, degradation studies were carried out by incubating \n\nuncoated chitosan scaffolds and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, with and without \n\nincorporated lysozyme, in two different buffer solutions: (i) Tris-HCl buffer (0.22 mM, pH 7.4) \n\nto simulate the normal pH found in human body; and (ii) citrate buffer (1.0 mM, pH 5.0) to \n\nsimulate the inflammatory response at 37 \u00baC for different periods of time. At the end of each \n\ndegradation period, the samples were removed, washed with distilled water and dried for \n\nlater calculation of weight loss (1). The morphology of the scaffolds after degradation was \n\nanalysed by SEM.  \n\n \n\n(1) Weight loss (%) = Initial weight \u2013 Final weight \n\n                                   Initial weight \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n149 \n\n2.5. Determination of lysozyme activity in solution and released from the CaP coatings \n\nIn order to evaluate the lysozyme activity and that released from the CaP coating at \n\npH 5 and pH 7.4, the Micrococcus lysodeikticus assay was used. This assay is based on the \n\nability of lysozyme to hydrolyse the cell wall fragments of bacteria. For determining the \n\nactivity of released lysozyme, coated scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were immersed in \n\nbuffer solution (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 30 days. The released lysozyme (150 \u00b5L) \n\nwas added to a 100 \u00b5L of Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension (2.3 mg/mL, pH 7.4) in a 96-\n\nwell plate. The decrease in turbidity at 37 \u00baC was measured at 450 nm (Microplate Reader, \n\nSynergyTM HT, BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., USA) at 1 min intervals during 30 minutes. The \n\nsame procedure was used to determine the enzyme activity at pH 5 and pH 7.4. For that, \n\nknown enzyme concentrations were prepared in buffers at pH 5 and pH 7.4 and added to the \n\nbacteria suspension in the same buffer. The initial kinetic rate (OD slope at t = 0) was \n\nmeasured for each sample, and a standard curve (lysozyme activity vs lysozyme \n\nconcentration) was constructed. The lysozyme activity released after 30 days was \n\ndetermined from the standard curve. \n\n \n\n2.6. Statistics \n\nResults of weight loss are expressed as means ? standard deviation with n=3 for \n\neach group. The statistical significance of differences was determined using Student\u2019s t-test \n\nmultiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &lt;0.05).  \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Development of CaP biomimetic coatings  \n\nFigure 1 shows SEM images of the uncoated chitosan scaffold (Figure 1A) and CaP \n\ncoated chitosan scaffolds after immersion in SBF solution in the presence (Figures 1C and \n\n1E) and absence (Figures 1B and 1D) of lysozyme. At the nucleation stage, it is possible to \n\nobserve for both conditions (with and without lysozyme) the formation of apatite nuclei \n\n(Figures 1B and 1C). Lysozyme incorporation in the nucleation stage did not significantly \n\naffect the morphology of the coatings (Figure 1C).  In the first 7 days of the growth stage for \n\nboth conditions, it is possible to observe that the size of CaP nuclei increased, forming a \n\ndense and compact CaP film. This means that immersion in SBF solution promotes the \n\ngrowth of CaP layer over time.  At higher magnifications, after 7 days of growth, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

Lysozyme \n\nincorporation into the coatings did not affect the morphology and growth of the coatings as a \n\nfunction of immersion time.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1. SEM images of the surface of  chitosan scaffolds: uncoated (A); coated with  CaP layer at \n\nnucleation stage (B, B1) and after 7 days in the growth stage (D, D1); and coated with CaP layer with \n\nincorporated lysozyme at nucleation stage (C, C1) and after 7 days in the growth stage (E, E1). The \n\nscale bar is 50 ?m for images A-E and 5 ?m for images B1-E1. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n151 \n\nFigure 2A presents the infrared spectra of CaP coatings with and without lysozyme \n\n(control) at nucleation stage.  Analysis of CaP coatings in absence of lysozyme shows the \n\npresence of phosphate (PO4\n3-) groups (bands at 1055, 602 and 556 cm-1). Moreover, the \n\npresence of carbonate (CO3\n2-) bands (1492 cm-1 and 1441 cm-1) was detected. When \n\nlysozyme was added at nucleation stage, the same phosphate and carbonate groups were \n\nalso detected (Figure 2A). In the spectrum of CaP coating with lysozyme, the appearance of \n\namide I band (1656 cm-1) was observed indicating that lysozyme is incorporated in the \n\ncoating. The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of C=O bonds in the backbone \n\nof the proteins 22,25. FTIR spectra of both CaP coatings, with and without lysozyme, confirmed \n\nan apatite layer formation on the surface of the scaffolds, with similar composition of the \n\nmajor mineral component of the bone26.  \n\nTF-XRD analyses were performed to determine whether the CaP coatings were \n\ncrystalline or amorphous.  Figure 2B shows TF-XRD patterns of CaP coatings in the absence \n\nand presence of lysozyme. No crystalline peaks were detected for CaP coated chitosan \n\nscaffolds with or without incorporated lysozyme at nucleation stage (Figures 2Bb and 2Bc). \n\nAfter 7 days of growth, two characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite are visible in the diffraction \n\npatterns of CaP coatings in the presence and absence of lysozyme, which are confirmed by \n\ncomparison to an XRD pattern of standard hydroxyapatite (JCPDS 9-432) (Figures 2Bd and \n\n2Be). These TF-XRD patterns confirm the formation of apatite layer owing to the presence of \n\napatite peaks. However, the apatite formed appears to be mainly amorphous. These results \n\ntogether with FTIR spectra suggest that the mineral formed is a carbonate apatite mineral \n\nsimilar to the major mineral component of bone. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. FTIR spectra of CaP coatings, with and without incorporated lysozyme at nucleation stage \n\n(A) and TF-XRD spectra (B) of uncoated chitosan scaffolds (a); CaP coated chitosan scaffolds at \n\nnucleation stage (b) and after 7 days of growth (d); CaP coated chitosan with incorporated lysozyme \n\nat nucleation stage (c) and after 7 days of growth (e). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n152 \n\n3.2. Degradation studies \n\nThe degradation behavior of the chitosan scaffolds developed (uncoated chitosan \n\nscaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with and without incorporated lysozyme) was \n\ninvestigated by incubation in buffer solutions for different periods of time. To simulate in vivo \n\nconditions and the ability of in situ pore formation, two different pHs were tested: pH 7.4 to \n\nsimulate normal physiological conditions; and pH 5 to simulate inflammatory response. \n\nOn analysis of the weight loss profile at pH 7.4 (Figure 3A), all scaffolds presented \n\ngradual weight loss as a function of degradation time. The lowest weight loss was observed \n\nfor uncoated chitosan scaffolds, with almost 4% after 60 days. The corresponding SEM \n\nimages show an increase in the surface roughness as a function of immersion time (Figures \n\n4D, 4G and 4J). These observations are in accordance with weight loss results (Figure 3A). \n\nThe CaP coated chitosan scaffolds presented a significant weight loss of 7.6 \u00b1 0.2% after 60 \n\ndays (Figure 3A).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Weight loss profile of uncoated chitosan scaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, CaP \n\ncoated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme as a function of immersion time at pH 7.4 (A) \n\nand pH 5 (B). (*) indicates a significant difference between time points for each condition. At pH 7.4 for \n\neach time point all difference between conditions is significant. (**) indicates a significant difference \n\nbetween conditions at the same time point. The weight loss at pH 5 for chitosan scaffolds is \n\nsignificantly different when compared with pH 7.4. \n\n \n\nSEM images show several changes in the CaP coatings morphology after only 3 days \n\nof immersion at pH 7.4, suggesting that the coatings may be gradually dissolved with time \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n153 \n\n(Figures 4E, 4H and 4K). CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme \n\npresented the highest weight loss as compared with the other two conditions (uncoated \n\nchitosan and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds), presenting a significant weight loss of \n\napproximately 9% after 14 days, which slightly increases to 11.5 \u00b1 1.0 % upon 60 days of \n\nimmersion (Figure 3A). Analysing SEM images (Figures 4C, 4F, 4I and 4L), some differences \n\nbetween the coatings in Tris-HCl pH 7.4 were observed as a function of immersion time. \n\nHowever, these differences are not pronounced when compared with CaP coatings in the \n\nabsence of lysozyme. Lysozyme seems to promote the degradation of chitosan scaffolds \n\nsurfaces, as it is possible to observe the highest weight loss when lysozyme is present. \n\nThese findings are corroborated by the results of enzyme activity that showed that the \n\nenzyme present on the coatings was still active after 30 days (Figure 6A). Nevertheless, \n\nimmersion periods at pH 7.4 up to 30 days induced roughness in the surface of uncoated \n\nchitosan scaffolds (Figures 4D, 4 G and 4J), and changes of the CaP coating morphology (in \n\nthe case of CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with and without incorporated lysozyme). \n\nHowever, all scaffolds were coated with a CaP layer, meaning that the coatings are quite \n\nstable at normal physiological pH. \n\nThe results of degradation studies performed at pH 5 are shown in Figure 3B. The \n\nsame trend was observed for the weight loss results at pH 7.4. Coated scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme exhibited a faster degradation rate, when compared with the other \n\ntwo conditions (uncoated chitosan and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds) (Figure 3B). This \n\nindicates the role of this enzyme on the hydrolysis of chitosan. These results are confirmed \n\nby the results of enzyme activity at pH 5, which show that lysozyme is active at that pH \n\n(Figure 6B). Independent of the pH, the presence of lysozyme seems to control the \n\ndegradation rate of the scaffolds. \n\nAnalysing the SEM images of uncoated chitosan scaffolds after 14 days of \n\ndegradation at pH 5, it is possible to observe increased degradation with immersion time \n\n(Figures 5A, 5D, 5G, 5J and 5M). After only 3 days, evident changes are observed on the \n\nsurface of uncoated chitosan scaffolds (Figure 6D). This appears to be related with high \n\nsusceptibility of chitosan at acidic pH. In Figures 5E, 5H, 5K and 5N, the images of CaP \n\ncoated chitosan scaffolds after different times at pH 5 are presented. After 1 hour almost all \n\nCaP layer was dissolved (data not shown), and it was non-existent after 1 day of degradation \n\n(Figure 5E). SEM images evidence the formation of pores after only 1 day, but the formation \n\nof interconnected pores is not clearly visible (Figures 5E, 5H, 5K and 5N). \n\nThe most interesting results were obtained for CaP coated scaffolds with incorporated \n\nlysozyme (Figures 5F, 5I, 5L and 5O).  The degradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan is \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

After 1 hour, it is possible to observe a CaP layer on the surface of scaffolds (data \n\nnot shown). However, after 1 day, as previously described, the dissolution of the coatings \n\nand pore formation as a function of degradation time was observed.  In this case, the \n\nformation of pores is clearly visible after 7 days with a structure having interconnected pores \n\n(Figures 5L and 5L1). After 14 days, the scaffolds exhibit pores with diameter of \n\napproximately 50-300 ?m (Figure 5O1). This pore formation is corroborated by the weight \n\nloss results. The CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme presented the \n\nhighest weight loss. In addition, lysozyme activity measurements at pH 5 showed that this \n\nenzyme is active.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel \nConcept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation \n\n156 \n\nThe incorporation of lysozyme into CaP coatings, grown on the surface of chitosan \n\nscaffolds may be used as a strategy to control their degradation rate better. Both degradation \n\nstudies (pH 7.4 and pH 5) show that the presence of lysozyme enhanced the degradation of \n\nchitosan scaffolds. The pH of the degradation media has a remarkable influence on CaP \n\ncoatings. At pH 7.4, all scaffolds remained coated up to 60 days. However, at pH 5, after 1 \n\nday, the dissolution of the coatings and formation of pores was observed mostly when due to \n\nthe presence of lysozyme. These results show that lysozyme has an important role in the \n\ndegradation of chitosan scaffolds. CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme \n\npresented the highest values of weight loss at both pH 7.4 and pH 5. At pH 7.4, no effect of \n\nlysozyme on the scaffold morphology was evident. Nevertheless, it enhanced the formation \n\nof a porous structure with interconnected pores at pH 5. \n\n \n\n3.3. Lysozyme activity in solution and released from the coatings  \n\nEvaluation of the activity of the lysozyme released from the coatings (Figure 6A) \n\nrevealed that the enzyme was able to hydrolyze the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell walls \n\n(as detected by the decrease in optical density with time). The results of this study (Figure \n\n6A) showed that the enzyme remained active after 30 days of immersion in buffer solution \n\n(pH 7.4). \n\n  Changes in the pH of the environment can alter or inhibit enzyme activity. In order to \n\nconfirm that lysozyme is active at both pH 5 and pH 7.4, known lysozyme concentrations \n\nwere used to construct a calibration curve. OD slopes were determined for different lysozyme \n\nconcentrations (Figure 6B) and an increase in enzymatic activity as a function of increasing \n\nlysozyme concentration was observed. Lysozyme is active at pH 5 and pH 7.4. The OD \n\nslope for the first 5 minutes in the graph was also calculated (Figure 6A) to determine \n\nlysozyme activity released from the coatings. The activity of lysozyme released from the \n\ncoatings was 0.0375 U (1U corresponds to the amount of enzyme which decreases the \n\nabsorbance at 450 nm per minute at pH 7.4, 37\u00baC using a suspension of Micrococcus \n\nlysodeikticus as substrate). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn this work, lysozyme was successfully incorporated into CaP coatings produced on \n\nthe surface of chitosan scaffolds, using a biomimetic technique. Degradation studies at pH \n\n7.4 to simulate normal physiological conditions showed that the morphology of uncoated \n\nscaffolds and CaP coatings changed. However, the formation of pores as a function of \n\nimmersion time was not observed.  Moreover, CaP coatings are very stable at pH 7.4 and, \n\nafter 30 days, all scaffolds remained covered with a CaP layer. At pH 5, to simulate an in vivo \n\ninflammatory response, a porous structure was formed when lysozyme was incorporated into \n\nthe CaP coatings. The degradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan at pH 5 is clearly visible \n\nfrom the appearance of pores. In addition, at high magnifications, SEM images suggest that \n\nthese pores are interconnected. It was also shown that lysozyme incorporated into the \n\ncoatings was active after 30 days of immersion in buffer solution (pH 7.4). This approach is \n\nvery promising, as the presence of lysozyme incorporated into the coatings will allow \n\nchitosan scaffolds with gradual in vivo pore-forming ability and antibacterial properties that \n\ncan simultaneously exhibit osteoconductive properties via the presence of CaP coating to be \n\nobtained.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThis work was supported by the European NoE EXPERTISSUES (NMP3-CT-2004-\n\n500283), the European STREP HIPPOCRATES (NMP3-CT-2003-505758), the Portuguese \n\nFoundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through POCTI and/or FEDER programmes. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

The overall vision is to use \n\nbiodegradable scaffolds based on chitosan and starch that present properties that will be \n\nregulated by bone regeneration, with the capability of gradual in situ pore formation. \n\nBiomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings were used as a strategy to incorporate \n\nlysozyme at the surface of chitosan-based materials with the main objective of controlling \n\nand tailoring their degradation profile as a function of immersion time.

Degradation studies with lysozyme (1.5 \n\ng/L) showed the formation of pores, indicating an increase of porosity (~5% - 55% up to 21 \n\ndays) resulting in porous three-dimensional (3D) structures with interconnected pores. \n\nAdditional studies investigated the influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat \n\nMSCs seeded on the CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated.

INTRODUCTION \n\nTissue engineering strategies include two general categories: (1) the use of acellular \n\nmatrices (artificial scaffolds or decellularized tissues), which depend upon the natural ability \n\nof the body to regenerate for proper orientation and direction of new tissue growth, and (2) \n\nthe use of scaffolds with cells (1, 2). The typical strategy involves the use of a porous \n\nscaffold, which serves as a transplantation vehicle for cultured cells and a template to guide \n\ntissue regeneration, thereby playing an important role in transforming the cell seeded \n\nscaffold into a new tissue. To allow a high density of colonizing cells and to promote \n\nneovascularization when implanted in vivo, the scaffolds should have high porosity, large \n\nsurface area, mechanical properties and pore sizes appropriate for the application, and a \n\nhighly interconnected pore structure (1). In addition, biocompatibility and biodegradability are \n\nalso required properties. Bone regeneration is a complex series of events involving \n\nproliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, bone matrix \n\nproduction and mineralization (3). \n\nAs extensively described in the literature, scaffold porosity is inversely related to the \n\nmechanical properties of the scaffold, thus it is necessary to balance the mechanical needs \n\nof the particular tissue that is going to be replaced and the scaffold porosity sufficient to allow \n\ntissue growth (4, 5). Therefore, this work proposes the use of non-porous scaffolds \n\ncomposed of an in vivo responsive material that will be regulated by bone regeneration, with \n\ngradual in situ pore formation and consequent scaffold resorption (6). This novel approach \n\nincludes the use of \u201csmart\u201d and stimulus responsive scaffolds that might be \u201cintelligent\u201d \n\nenough to control their degradation profile as a function of implantation time and to induce \n\nosteogenic differentiation of MSCs. \n\nChitosan has been considered to be a promising material for tissue engineering applications \n\n(7-9). It is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine, derived from \n\nthe deacetylation of chitin. The deacetylation degree measures the percentage of \n\nglucosamine units in the polymer chain and influences its physicochemical properties such \n\nas solubility, crystallinity, swelling behaviour and biological properties (10), such as \n\nosteogenesis enhancement (11-13). The N-acetylglucosamine present in chitosan is also \n\nresponsible for nitric oxide production by rat peritoneal exudate macrophages (14) at \n\nreasonable levels in terms of inflammatory response but very effective in terms of wound \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Natural Stimulus Responsive Scaffolds/Cells for Bone Tissue Engineering: Influence of Lysozyme upon Scaffold \nDegradation and Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells Induced by CaP Coatings \n\n165 \n\ntissue repair (15). It has been also demonstrated that chitosan is degraded in vitro and in \n\nvivo by lysozyme (15-17), an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body. Moreover, hydrolytic \n\nactions of lysozyme are able to activate macrophages and to promote collagen deposition. \n\nThe biocompatibility of chitosan might be attributed to its structural similarity to \n\nglycosaminoglycan, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone \n\nand cartilage (12).   \n\nStarch was used as a component of the scaffolds presented in this study as a sacrifice \n\nmaterial that will be easily degraded by several enzymes occurring in the human body (6). \n\nSeveral in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that starch-based biomaterials are \n\nbiocompatible (18-20) and biodegradable (6, 21, 22). The main enzymes involved in starch \n\ndegradation are ?-amylases, ?-amylases, ?-glucosidases, glucoamylases, and other \n\ndebranching enzymes (pullulanase and isoamylase) (23, 24).  The enzymatic degradation \n\nproducts of starch hydrolysis are mainly glucose, maltose and dextrin (24). \n\nChitosan and starch scaffolds typically do not present adequate bone bonding, \n\nosteoconductive or osteoinductive properties for bone tissue engineering applications. One \n\npossible solution is to apply on the surface of 3D structures a calcium phosphate (CaP) \n\nbiomimetic coating with a composition similar to the major inorganic component of bone, \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA). In addition, biomimetic CaP coatings have been considered as potential \n\ncarriers of bioactive proteins without compromising their activity, as they are generated under \n\nphysiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37\u00baC) (22, 25-28). It has been shown that different proteins \n\ncan be directly integrated into the structure of CaP coatings without compromising their \n\nactivity, and their release is mainly controlled by the dissolution mechanism of the coating \n\n(22, 25-27). In this sense, biomimetic coatings were used to tailor the material surface \n\nproperties or to directly enhance cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. \n\nMoreover, CaP coatings are used as a means to functionalize biomaterials with biological \n\naffinity and protein adsorption properties, as previously mentioned (28). The incorporation of \n\ndifferent enzymes into CaP coatings, prepared on the surface of scaffolds by means of a \n\nbiomimetic coating technique seems to be a very interesting strategy to control their \n\ndegradation rate. In this work, lysozyme was incorporated into the coatings with the aim of \n\ndeveloping a self-regulating degradable material with a capacity for gradual in situ pore \n\nformation. In addition, this system can simultaneously exhibit osteoinductive and \n\nosteoconductive properties in the sense that it can act as a carrier system for the controlled \n\nrelease of multiple biologically active proteins. In the past decade, a large number of \n\npublications showed osteoinduction by calcium phosphate coatings in several animal models \n\n(29, 30). Recent research has shown that the biological performance of osteoinductive \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Natural Stimulus Responsive Scaffolds/Cells for Bone Tissue Engineering: Influence of Lysozyme upon Scaffold \nDegradation and Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells Induced by CaP Coatings \n\n166 \n\nbiomaterials, namely on new bone growth orthotopically, is significantly better than non-\n\nosteoinductive biomaterials (30). \n\nThe present study reports the use of CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme. This study was designed to answer the following questions: How \n\ndoes lysozyme influence the formation of pores in chitosan scaffolds, using a similar \n\nconcentration to the one incorporated into CaP coatings? 2) Does this concentration of \n\nlysozyme allow the formation of interconnected pores? 3) Are CaP coated chitosan-based \n\nscaffolds able to enhance osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs compared with uncoated \n\n(without CaP coating) scaffolds? \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nIn this work, degradable scaffolds based on chitosan and corn starch were \n\ndeveloped. Two different compositions were prepared using a precipitation method (7): \n\nchitosan (Ch) and chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS). Briefly, chitosan was dissolved in acetic \n\nacid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution. Then, using the same procedure, another \n\nformulation was prepared with the following ratio: 60/40 chitosan/starch. The chitosan and \n\nchitosan/starch solutions were cast into moulds and frozen (-18\u00baC) overnight (6). They were \n\nthen immersed in a precipitation solution (25% (v) NaOH 1M and 75% (v) Na2SO4 0.5M) \n\novernight, adapted from (7). After precipitation, the samples were washed several times with \n\ndistilled water to remove excess salt from the precipitation solution.  After this procedure, two \n\nother formulations were prepared based on biomimetic coating methodology (31, 32), \n\nconsisting of an impregnation of the materials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? (45S5) \n\nsupplied by NovaMin Technology (Alachua, Florida, USA) followed by an immersion in a \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF, 37\u00baC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human \n\nblood plasma. Briefly, chitosan (Ch) and chitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds were immersed in a \n\nwet bed of bioglass for 6 hours in a rotator. After that, the scaffolds where immersed in \n\nsimulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) solution with lysozyme (1 g/L) for 7 days at 37\u00baC (nucleation \n\nstage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP nuclei. After the nucleation stage, all \n\nsamples were washed with distilled water and immersed in a concentrated simulated body \n\nfluid solution (1.5 SBF) for 7 days at 37\u00baC in order to enhance CaP nuclei growth. Two \n\ndifferent samples were obtained after the biomimetic coating technique: CaP chitosan \n\nscaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaP/Ch + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch \n\nscaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaP/CS + lysozyme) (33). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Degradation studies \n\nDegradation studies were performed in triplicate by incubating the chitosan scaffolds \n\n(Ch) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) with lysozyme (1.5 g/L), a \n\nconcentration similar to the ones incorporated into CaP biomimetic coatings, at 37\u00baC up to 21 \n\ndays. Lysozyme solution was changed every 7 days. At the end of the degradation period, \n\nthe samples were removed, washed with distilled water and dried in a graded series of \n\nethanol for later calculation of weight loss. The porosity, pore interconnectivity, pore size and \n\nthree-dimensional structures of dry chitosan scaffolds were analysed before and after \n\ndegradation by micro-computed tomography (\u00b5 -CT). \n\n \n\n2.3. Micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) \n\nThe scaffolds were analysed using micro-Computed Tomography (\u00b5-CT) before and \n\nafter degradation with lysozyme for the different periods of immersion (0, 3, 14 and 21 days). \n\n\u00b5-CT was carried out using a Skyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) (pixel size \n\nresolution of 6.59 ?m), with X-ray source settings of 40 keV and 250 ?A. The data sets were \n\nacquired over a rotation range of 180\u00b0 (0.45\u00b0 rotation step) and reconstructed with software \n\n(NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). Representative data sets were segmented with a dynamic \n\nthreshold of 40-255 and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, \n\nSkyScan) and to build the 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric \n\nanalysis included porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. \n\n3D virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, \n\nvisualized and registered using both image processing software packages to access the \n\nmorphological changes after degradation (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator).  The \n\ninterconnectivity was quantified as the accessible void fraction over a range of minimum \n\nconnection sizes using an analysis software tool (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). A 3D \n\nshrink-wrap process was performed to shrink the outside boundary of the volume of interest \n\n(VOI) in a scaffold through any openings whose size was equal to or larger than ~50 \u00b5m. Any \n\npore size below this value was considered to be a closed pore, based upon reported \n\nminimum pore interconnection sizes for bone tissue ingrowth (34). Interconnectivity was \n\ncalculated as follows (35): \n\nInterconnectivity = (Vt -Vsw)/(Vt - Vm) \u00d7 100% \n\nwhere Vt is the total volume of the VOI, Vsw is the VOI volume after 3D shrink-wrap \n\nprocessing, and Vm is the volume of scaffold material. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Natural Stimulus Responsive Scaffolds/Cells for Bone Tissue Engineering: Influence of Lysozyme upon Scaffold \nDegradation and Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells Induced by CaP Coatings \n\n168 \n\nThe wall thickness was defined as the pore wall thickness and was quantified with ?-\n\nCT analysis based upon structural indices using a software tool (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, \n\nSkyScan). Specifically, quantitative analysis of the pore wall thickness was retrieved from the \n\n3D analysis using structure thickness (St.Th) parameters. \n\n \n\n2.4. MSCs isolation \n\nRat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were obtained from femurs and tibias of 41-44 days \n\nold male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using the method described by \n\nManiatoupoulos et al. (36). The harvested cells were cultured until confluence in a humidified \n\natmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00baC. Non-adherent cells were removed after 1 and 3 days. \n\nUpon reaching confluence, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in a \n\nknown amount of medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a final concentration \n\nof 3x106 cells/ml. This cell suspension was then aliquoted into cryotubes for storage in liquid \n\nnitrogen (~1 ml/cryotube).  \n\n \n\n2.5. Cell seeding \n\nChitosan-based scaffolds with 6 mm diameter and thickness of 0.8-1.0 mm were \n\npress fit into 6 mm diameter cassettes and covered with complete osteogenic medium [?-\n\nMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker \n\n(Walkersville, MD), 50 ?g/ml gentamicin, 100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-\n\nascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone] overnight. After 1 \n\nday, each scaffold was seeded with 280,000 cells contained in 100 ?l of complete osteogenic \n\nmedia in accordance with previous studies (37, 38). Three hours after cell seeding, 10 ml of \n\ncomplete osteogenic media was added to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of \n\nattachment, the scaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates for 8, 16 and 21 days with \n\ncomplete osteogenic medium. Media were changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n \n\n= 6 samples. \n\nAt the end of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and \n\nrinsed with phosphate buffered saline solution. Three samples from each group were stored \n\nat -20\u00baC in ddH2O until analyses were performed. One of the remaining 3 samples was \n\nimmersed in PBS with calcein-AM for 45 minutes for observation under confocal microscopy, \n\nand the other two samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for FTIR analysis and for \n\nobservation under SEM. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

DNA analysis \n\nMeasurement of the cell number in chitosan-based scaffolds was assessed from cell \n\nlysates using the Picogreen dsDNA Quantification Kit according to the instructions of the \n\nmanufacturer (Molecular Probes). All standards and samples were prepared in triplicate. The \n\nfluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., \n\nWinooski, Vermont) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. The cellularity of each \n\nscaffold was calculated by correlation with the DNA concentrations measured from a known \n\nnumber of marrow stromal cells.  \n\n \n\n2.7. Alkaline phosphatase activity measurements \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an \n\nestablished protocol (37). All reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All \n\nsamples were prepared in triplicate and compared against p-nitrophenol standards. The \n\nreaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of 0.3 N NaOH. Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a \n\nplate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, Vermont) to determine the alkaline \n\nphosphatase activity per scaffold. \n\n \n\n2.8. Calcium deposition measurement \n\nCalcium deposition measurements were made in triplicate. CaP coated chitosan-\n\nbased scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme without cells at the end of each time period were \n\nused as controls to determine the calcium content of the coating. Then, these values were \n\nsubtracted from the calcium content obtained by CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme cultured with cells to normalize the data. Calcium deposition was \n\nevaluated using a calcium assay from Diagnostic Chemicals Limited. After ALP and DNA \n\nassays were completed, a volume of 1N acetic acid equal to the remaining volume was \n\nadded to each well (for a final concentration of 0.5 N), and the plate was placed on an orbital \n\nshaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample \n\nsolution in 96-well plates. All samples were assessed in triplicate.  To generate a standard \n\ncurve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance was read at 650 nm \n\nwith a spectrophotometer plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, Vermont). \n\nThe calcium deposition in each scaffold is reported as ?g Ca2+. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Microscopy analysis \n\nAfter each time period, chitosan-based scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, \n\nwashed with PBS and stained with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) according to the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 45 minutes immersion in PBS with calcein-AM, images \n\nwere recorded using a laser scanning confocal microscope with a 10x APO objective (Zeiss \n\nLSM 510 Axiovert, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nwere washed twice in PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes.

The scaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in a \n\ngraded series of ethanol and dried at room temperature. All spectra were recorded using 64 \n\nscans and 4 cm-1 in a FTIR spectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21, Fourier Transformer infrared \n\nspectrophotometer, Shimadzu).  \n\n \n\n2.11.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Degradation studies \n\nThe degradation of chitosan in the human body has been reported to be carried out \n\nby lysozyme (16, 17). Previous studies have identified the optimal concentration of lysozyme \n\nfor the degradation of chitosan-based scaffolds in vitro to be 1.5 g/L (33).  Accordingly, a \n\nlysozyme concentration of 1.5 g/L was used in the present study for optimal degradation of \n\nthe chitosan-based scaffolds, as well as to approximate the concentration of similar enzymes \n\npreviously incorporated into biomimetic CaP coatings (22) and the concentration of lysozyme \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

As observed in Figure 1, \n\nchitosan scaffolds were degraded gradually as a function of immersion time in lysozyme \n\nsolution (1.5 g/L). The weight loss (%) after 3, 7, 14 and 21 days was: 11.6 \u00b1 0.5, 14.9 \u00b1 0.4, \n\n15.6 \u00b1 0.4 and 18.2 \u00b1 1.1, respectively (Figure 1). This gradual weight loss is confirmed by \n\nimages obtained by ?-CT, where an almost non-porous structure before degradation was \n\nobserved (Figure 2A) with a significant increase in porosity after different time periods, being \n\nobvious after 14 days (Figure 2D) and 21 days (Figure 2E). These results demonstrate the \n\nability of lysozyme to induce degradation and subsequent formation of pores into chitosan \n\nscaffolds. \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\nTim e  (days)\n\nW\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n\nlo\ns\ns\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nlysozyme 1.5 g/L\n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Images of chitosan (Ch) scaffolds obtained by ?-CT: before degradation (A),  after  3 days (B), \n\n7 days (C), 14 days (D), and 21 days (E) of degradation with lysozyme (1.5 g/L). Lysozyme solution \n\ninduced degradation and enhanced subsequent formation of pores in chitosan scaffolds as a function of \n\nimmersion time. \n\n \n\nUpon analysing the images of chitosan (Ch) scaffolds obtained by ?-CT, it is possible \n\nto see the increase of porosity as a function of immersion time (Figure 2). The control \n\nscaffolds (before degradation) presented ~5% porosity. According to Figure 3A lysozyme \n\nenhanced the porosity of the scaffolds as a function of degradation time. After different time \n\npoints, lysozyme had a significant effect on chitosan scaffolds, inducing the formation of a \n\nporous structure (Figure 2 and Figure 3A). Furthermore, the interconnectivity of chitosan \n\nscaffolds increased significantly after 21 days (Figure 3B). Moreover, the effect of lysozyme \n\nwas also detected in pore size and wall thickness results (Figures 4A and 4B), where a \n\nsignificant increase in size of pores (Figure 4A) and a significant decrease of wall thickness \n\n(Figure 4B) was evident compared with control scaffolds (before degradation). These results \n\nwere expected since after different periods of degradation with lysozyme the formation of \n\npores was observed, evidencing a significant increase of porosity as a function of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Assays \n\nConfocal microscopy images after 8 days show that rat marrow stromal cells were \n\nable to adhere to all scaffold formulations and maintain their viability. Cells covered the \n\nsurface of all scaffolds, and no differences can be observed among groups (Figure 5).  \n\n CBA DCBA D\n\n \n\nFigure 5. Laser scanning confocal microscope images of cells stained with calcein-AM at the top \n\nsurface of scaffolds after 8 days: (A) chitosan (Ch); (B) CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated \n\nlysozyme; (C) chitosan/starch (CS) and (D) CaP coated chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated \n\nlysozyme. All images obtained 45 minutes after incubation with calcein-AM using a 10X APO objective. \n\nThe scale bar is 100 \u00b5m and applies to all images. Rat MSCs adhered to all scaffold formulations and \n\nmaintained viability after 8 days of culture, with no differences observed among the groups. \n\n \n\n Scaffold cellularity is presented in Figure 6. It should be noted that for cases in which \n\ncells were completely entrapped within extracellular matrix produced during culture, such that \n\nthe DNA therein could not be fully liberated for inclusion in the lysate for assessment of \n\ncellularity, then the measured results may reflect an underestimation of the actual number of \n\ncells on/within the scaffold, especially at later time points. However, an increase in cell \n\nnumber indicating cell proliferation was observed between day 16 and day 21 for all groups. \n\nThe number of cells after 8 days was lower than was expected, except for CaP coated \n\nchitosan/starch with incorporated lysozyme. This can be related to the small surface area of \n\nscaffolds where cells were seeded and explained by a lack of initial porosity in these \n\nscaffolds. However after 21 days, a significant increase was observed in the number of cells \n\nfor CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme which corresponds to the \n\nincrease in porosity as a function of time, as was shown in the degradation results (Figure 1). \n\nDuring the time of culture with MSCs, it was expected that lysozyme would be able to \n\ndegrade CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds, inducing the formation of pores by lysozyme \n\nand allowing the penetration and colonization of cells into the scaffolds, as shown in Figure \n\n7B after 21 days. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

The SEM \n\nimages after 8 days show cells attached to scaffold surfaces, however after 16 and 21 days \n\nall surfaces were completely colonized by the cells, and after 21 days mineralized matrix was \n\nobserved on CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds (Figure 7A), clearly visible at high \n\nmagnifications for scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (Figure 7B). These results \n\ncorroborate the calcium content measurements, where calcium was detected after 16 and 21 \n\ndays (Figure 9). Additionally, small pores were observed in the dense layer for CaP/CS + \n\nlysozyme at high magnifications after 8 and 21 days.

CaP/CS + lysozyme and uncoated scaffolds (Ch \n\nand CS) reached their maximum measured ALP activity on day 8 and 16, respectively \n\n(Figure 8), reflecting the early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. The highest \n\nvalue of ALP activity for CaP/Ch + lysozyme was obtained at day 21, however the difference \n\nbetween the 16th and 21st days was not statistically significant. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

No calcified extracellular matrix deposition was \n\nobserved at day 8 (Figure 9). After 16 days calcium deposition was detected for CaP coated \n\nchitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme. At the end of the 3rd week, the calcium \n\nmeasurements indicated the deposition of significant amounts of mineralized matrix for all \n\nscaffolds, with a significant increase for CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme (Figure 9). The amount of calcium detected on CaP coated scaffolds \n\nwas higher for both time points of CaP/Ch + lysozyme, however when comparing cellularity \n\n(Figure 6), it is apparent  that the number of cells was also higher, indicating that the lower \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Nevertheless, when comparing the number of cells present in these two \n\nscaffolds with the calcium content, both scaffolds had a similar effect on the cells. Indeed, \n\ncomparison of cellularity results (Figure 6) and ALP activity results (Figure 8) reveals that the \n\nmaximum ALP activity occurred at either day 16 or 21 for all groups except the CaP/CS + \n\nlysozyme group.  As ALP activity is an early marker of osteoblastic differentiation of cells, \n\nand as cellular differentiation and proliferation are inversely proportional, it follows that a \n\nminimum in cellularity at day 16 may reasonably correspond with a peak in ALP activity at \n\nday 16.  Further, the presence of mineralized matrix, as measured by calcium content of \n\nconstructs, increased with time for all groups, indicating the osteogenic differentiation of cells \n\nin all groups, although this effect was most pronounced in the CaP coated scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.

Natural Stimulus Responsive Scaffolds/Cells for Bone Tissue Engineering: Influence of Lysozyme upon Scaffold \nDegradation and Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells Induced by CaP Coatings \n\n179 \n\n3.3. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-\n\nATR) \n\nAnalysing FTIR-ATR spectra of controls (without cells) of chitosan (Ch) and \n\nchitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds, the characteristic bands of chitosan (1150\u2013890 cm-1) were \n\ndetected (Figures 10A and 10C). After 16 and 21 days of culture (Figures 10A and 10C), \n\nthese spectra showed the presence of amide bands: 1650 cm-1 (amide I) and 1542 cm-1 \n\n(amide II), which can be related to protein matrix formation.  Carbonate groups at 1500-1418 \n\ncm-1 were also detected (Figures 10A and 10B).  These carbonate groups are related to \n\ncarbonate apatite, one of the calcium phosphates present in bone tissue, suggesting the \n\npresence of mineralized extracellular matrix. In Figures 10B and 10D are presented the \n\nspectra of CaP/Ch with incorporated lysozyme and CaP/CS with incorporated lysozyme \n\nscaffolds. In FTIR-ATR spectra of the CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds when lysozyme \n\nwas incorporated, the presence of amide I and amide II in uncultured scaffolds (controls) was \n\ndetected (Figures 10B and 10D). The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of \n\nC=O bonds in the backbone of the protein (40). Furthermore, the amide II band arises from \n\nthe combination of C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of the protein backbone (40). \n\nThese bands obtained in the case of the control samples could indicate the adsorption of \n\nlysozyme on the surface of chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds. However, an increase of \n\nintensity of these bands was observed as a function of culture time (Figures 10B and 10D). \n\nAs previously mentioned, these might indicate a protein matrix formation. In the spectra of \n\ncontrol scaffolds (Figures 10B and 10D), carbonate bands (1500-1418 cm-1) were also \n\ndetected, which are associated with CaP coating on the surface of the scaffolds. In addition, \n\nthese bands became more intense with culture time, suggesting the formation of mineralized \n\nextracellular matrix. However, phosphate bands (1190-976 cm-1) were not clearly detected, \n\nwhich was likely related to overlapping with the polysaccharide ring band of chitosan (1150-\n\n890 cm-1). \n\nFTIR-ATR results confirm the calcium measurements results, clearly suggesting \n\nprotein matrix formation and the presence of mineralized extracellular matrix. Furthermore, \n\nthese results suggest that the mineral formed by rat marrow stromal cells cultured for 16 and \n\n21 days is carbonate apatite mineral similar to the major mineral component of bone. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe degradation studies performed with lysozyme using similar concentration to \n\nthose incorporated into CaP coatings showed the formation of pores as a function of \n\nimmersion time, indicating an increase of porosity ~5% - 55% up to 21 days. Lysozyme had a \n\nsignificant effect on chitosan scaffolds resulting in porous 3D structures with interconnected \n\npores (~78%). On the basis of these studies it was concluded that CaP biomimetic coatings \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

The demonstrated ability of \n\nthese novel surface coated scaffolds to form an interconnected pore structure in situ coupled \n\nwith the positive effect of these scaffolds on the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and \n\nmineralized matrix production clearly illustrate the strong potential of these scaffolds for \n\napplication in bone tissue engineering strategies. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Serena Danti.

INTRODUCTION \n\nThe evaluation of a bone tissue engineering constructs in a subcutaneous model in \n\nvivo is often the first step following in vitro characterization. In previous studies we proposed \n\nthe use of non-porous, stimulus responsive chitosan-based scaffolds with self-regulated \n\ndegradation for bone tissue engineering applications [1, 2]. Additional studies [3] investigated \n\nthe influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone \n\nmarrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat MSCs seeded on \n\nthe CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated to aid degradation. \n\nWhen compared with cells seeded onto control (uncoated) scaffolds, cells seeded onto CaP \n\ncoated chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme demonstrated at all culture \n\ntimes greater osteogenic differentiation, bone matrix production and mineralization as \n\ndemonstrated by calcium deposition measurements [3]. \n\nThis approach is based on the use of a material that exhibits both self-regulated \n\ndegradation and gradual in situ pore formation ability [1, 2]. It has been demonstrated that \n\nlysozyme, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body [4, 5], degrades chitosan in vitro and in \n\nvivo [6, 7]. Lysozyme can attack cell wall polysaccharides of different bacterial species, \n\nespecially Gram positive species, leading to rupture of the cell wall and subsequent death of \n\nthe microorganism [8, 9]. The anti-inflammatory action of lysozyme is based on the \n\nneutralization of acidic substances released in the inflammatory process [10]. Previously, \n\nusing a biomimetic technique, the surface of the scaffolds was coated with a calcium \n\nphosphate with a composition similar to the major inorganic component of bone, \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA) [2, 3, 11]. The main advantage of the biomimetic method [12-14] is the \n\nuse of physiological conditions (pH 7.4 at 37\u00baC) that simulate the manner that apatite is \n\nformed in bone [15]. Moreover, this technique allows the incorporation of proteins and \n\nbioactive agents into CaP coatings without compromising their activity [2, 16, 17]. Chitosan \n\nand starch by themselves or in combination do not have adequate bone bonding, \n\nosteoconductive or osteoinductive properties for bone tissue engineering applications, and \n\nCaP coating may give raise to such key properties. \n\nThe incorporation of lysozyme into CaP coatings prepared at the surface of chitosan-\n\nbased scaffolds using a biomimetic methodology was employed to control and tailor the \n\nscaffolds\u2019 degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores [2, 3, 11]. In vitro, these \n\nscaffolds gradually exhibit in situ pore formation [2]. Based on previous work [1, 2], it is \n\nhypothesized that following implantation of the scaffold, an acute inflammatory response will \n\noccur with a subsequent pH decrease, and neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages \n\nwill be recruited. Different enzymes, such as lysozyme, and other reactive species will be \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n191 \n\nreleased in high levels from these cells, inducing degradation of the scaffolds in situ with \n\nsubsequent pore formation. To prove the concept of in situ pore formation in vitro, previous \n\nstudies simulating the inflammatory response were performed, and the formation of pores \n\nwas clearly visible when CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were used [2]. \n\nHighly porous structures were formed as a function of degradation time, with pore diameters \n\nranging from 50-300 ?m, suggesting that the pores were fully interconnected [2]. This size of \n\npores greater than 150 ?m encourages the ingrowth of mineralized bone [18]. \n\nThe combination of chitosan with other biodegradable materials has already shown to \n\nbe effective for bone-related applications [19-21]. \n\nThe inclusion of starch in chitosan matrices constitutes an interesting approach \n\ntowards obtain scaffolds with enhanced degradation rates since starch is acting as a sacrifice \n\nmaterial [1]. Furthermore, starch is enzymatically hydrolysed by ?-amylase, an enzyme \n\npresent in blood serum. Starch is a natural polymer that presents excellent characteristics for \n\nbiomaterials applications, such as low toxicity [22, 23]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies \n\nhave shown that scaffolds produced from starch-based biomaterials are biocompatible in \n\nspecific applications [24-26] and biodegradable in different conditions [1, 3, 27, 28].  \n\nIn order to prove the concept of in situ pore formation within chitosan-based scaffolds \n\nin vivo, a rat subcutaneous implantation model was employed. It was hypothesized that using \n\nthis innovative methodology, the scaffolds, which at the time of implantation exhibit very \n\npromising mechanical properties due to the absence of macroporosity [1], will exhibit in situ \n\npore formation facilitated by enzymes present in the body (namely the ?-amylase and \n\nlysozyme). This study was designed to investigate the following specific aims: (i) assess the \n\ndegradation of the scaffolds in vivo, (ii) characterize the in situ formation of pores, and (iii) \n\nassess in vivo the concept of in situ pore-formation. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nDegradable scaffolds based on chitosan and corn starch were used. Two different \n\ncompositions were prepared using a precipitation method: chitosan (CH) and chitosan/starch \n\nscaffolds (CS) [1]. Briefly, chitosan was dissolved in 1% (v/v) acetic acid to obtain a 5% (w/v) \n\nsolution. Then, using the same procedure, another formulation was prepared with the \n\nfollowing ratio: 60/40 chitosan/starch. The chitosan and chitosan/starch solutions were cast \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering\u00a0\n\n192 \n\ninto moulds and frozen (-20 \u00baC) overnight [1]. They were then immersed in a precipitation \n\nsolution (25% (v) NaOH 1M and 75% (v) Na2SO4 0.5M) [1, 29] and washed several times \n\nwith distilled water. After this procedure, four other formulations were prepared based on \n\npreviously used biomimetic coating techniques [2, 3, 11] consisting of an impregnation of the \n\nmaterials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? (45S5; NOVABONE Alachua, Florida, USA) \n\nfollowed by an immersion in a 1? simulated body fluid (SBF, 37\u00baC, pH 7.4), which has ionic \n\nconcentrations similar to those of the human blood plasma. Briefly, chitosan (CH) and \n\nchitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds were immersed in a wet bed of bioglass for 6 hours on an \n\norbital rotator. After that, the scaffolds where immersed in 1? SBF with and without lysozyme \n\n(1 g/L) for 7 days at 37\u00baC (nucleation stage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP \n\nnuclei. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with distilled water and \n\nimmersed in 1.5? SBF for 7 days at 37\u00baC in order to enhance CaP nuclei growth (growth \n\nstage). Four different samples were obtained using the biomimetic coating technique: CaP \n\nchitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds \n\nwith incorporated lysozyme (CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with \n\nincorporated lysozyme (CaPCS + lysozyme) [2, 3, 11]. All chemical reagents were purchased \n\nfrom Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. \n\n \n\n2.2. Implant preparation \n\nIn this study 5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm thick scaffolds were used. All \n\nscaffolds were sterilized with ethylene oxide gas for 14 h prior to implantationin conditions \n\ndescribed elsewhere [30, 31]. One day before subcutaneous implantation surgery, the \n\nimplants were prewetted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in 24-well plates \n\novernight under sterile conditions.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Subcutaneous implantation \n\nAll animal manipulations were approved by Rice University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care \n\nand Use Committee. Twenty four male Wistar rats 41-44 days old (Charles River \n\nLaboratories, USA) were used for subcutaneous implantation of acellular scaffolds. Three \n\nimplantation periods were used: 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Anesthesia was induced with a 4% \n\nisoflurane/oxygen mixture, and maintained with 2% isoflurane during surgical manipulation. \n\nThe rats were monitored to ensure that an appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia was \n\nmaintained. The fur on the dorsum of the rat was clipped closely prior to surgery. Then, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n193 \n\nanimals were placed in a ventral position, the clipped dorsum was disinfected with povidone-\n\niodine and six small longitudinal incisions were made as described in Figure 1. A pocket was \n\nbluntly dissected at each incision, and one scaffold was placed in each pocket. One implant \n\nfrom each experimental group was implanted in twenty four rats (six implants per rat). A total \n\nof 8 scaffolds per experimental group per time point were implanted. Previous studies \n\nreported successful implantation of 6 materials in rat dorsal subcutaneous pockets using \n\nWistar rats of similar or lower size [32-35]. The incisions were closed with simple interrupted \n\n5-0 Vicryl sutures. Each animal received an intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline to aid \n\npost-operative recovery (1 ml/100 g/hour of anesthesia) and a subcutaneous injection of \n\nbuprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) both before and 8-12 hours after surgery for analgesia. On the \n\nfollowing day, two additional doses of subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) were \n\ninjected for continued post-operative analgesia (i.e., at 20-24 and 32-36 hours post-op). Care \n\nwas taken to give all subcutaneous injections caudal to the implantation sites. Animals were \n\nhoused individually with water and food given ad libitum. At each time point, animals were \n\nanesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and euthanized with carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The \n\nimplants were retrieved after a bilateral thoracotomy was performed to ensure death. \n\n \n\n2.4. Preparation of samples for weight loss and micro-computed tomography (?-CT) \n\nanalysis \n\nAfter each implantation time, three scaffolds from each group were decellularized \n\nprior to weight loss measurement and micro-computed tomography analysis. Briefly, the \n\nscaffolds were immersed in double-distilled water (ddH2O) and placed in a 24-well plate at -\n\n20 \u00baC. After that, scaffolds underwent three freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and in a 37 \n\n\u00baC water bath, respectively, to disrupt attached cells and remove cellular debris [36]. After \n\nthis process scaffolds were air-dried in a laminar flow hood. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

The \n\nX-ray source was set at 70 keV of energy and 142 ?A of current. Approximately 400 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n195 \n\nprojections were acquired over a rotation range of 180\u00b0 with a rotation step of 0.45\u00b0. Data \n\nsets were reconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon \n\nv1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was 400 serial 1024x1024 bitmap \n\nimages. Representative data sets were segmented into binary images using a dynamic \n\nthreshold of 40-255 for polymer and 130-255 for CaP coating (grey values). These \n\nrepresentative data sets were used for morphometric 3D analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, \n\nSkyScan) and to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric \n\nanalysis included porosity and pore interconnectivity. 3D virtual models of representative \n\nregions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, visualized and registered using image \n\nprocessing software (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator). \n\n \n\n2.7. Histology \n\nAfter euthanasia, the implants were retrieved along with the surrounding tissue and \n\nprocessed for histology. Five specimens from each group per time point were fixed in 10% \n\nneutral buffered formalin and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, immersed in \n\ninfiltration solutions, embedded in Technovit glycol methacrylate (kit 8100, Heraeus Kulzer, \n\nEBSciences, CO, USA) and subsequently polymerized. Three specimens from each group \n\nper time period were cut to obtain longitudinal sections and two specimens were cut to obtain \n\ntransverse sections of 7 ?m thickness using a modified microtome equipped with a tungsten \n\nblade (Leica RM 2155). \n\nSections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to evaluate the in vivo \n\ndegradation, pore formation and cellular infiltration through the implants. For visualization of \n\nthe CaP coating, additional sections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for \n\n25 min and counterstained with 0.5% safranin O solution. All images were obtained using an \n\nOlympus BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera (Olympus DP70). \n\nHistological sections from all time points were scored by the authors (AMM, ARP and CMA) \n\nblinded for group conditions and implantation time, and consensus was reached on the final \n\nscore. The cellular ingrowth within the implants and the degradation of each sample was \n\nqualitatively scored based on dissolution, cracks, and fragmentation on a scale modified from \n\nDe Jong, as shown in Table 1 [37]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n197 \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Weight loss measurements \n\nLysozyme, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body [5, 38], has been reported to be \n\nresponsible for the in vivo degradation of chitosan [6, 39]. As observed in Figure 2, all groups \n\ndegraded gradually as a function of implantation time. Statistically significant weight loss (p &lt;\n\n0.05) was observed for chitosan/starch scaffolds with and without CaP coating and both in \n\nthe presence and in absence of lysozyme after 12 weeks of implantation. The highest weight \n\nloss after 12 weeks was 29.8 \u00b1 1.5% for CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with lysozyme \n\nincorporated (Figure 2). It is expected that for longer implantation times, the degradation and \n\nthe in situ formation of pores will be greater that the obtained in the herein presented studies \n\nperformed up to 12 weeks. Comparing all groups at the same time point, chitosan scaffolds \n\nhad the lowest weight loss overall, but this was, as expected, slightly increased when \n\nlysozyme was present. Chitosan/starch scaffolds with and without CaP and in the presence \n\nor absence of lyzozyme demonstrated significantly greater weight loss than chitosan \n\nscaffolds for all time points (Figure 2).  \n\nPrevious studies investigated the degradation of chitosan scaffolds with and without \n\nCaP coating and in the presence and absence of lysozyme at pH 5 to simulate the \n\ninflammatory response [2]. The weight loss in vitro was not as pronounced as that observed \n\nin vivo. Similar to the in vivo experiments described herein, in vitro CaP coated chitosan \n\nscaffolds with incorporated lysozyme had the highest weight loss [2]. However, the complete \n\ndissolution of the CaP coatings was not observed in vivo, although it was in vitro at pH 5, \n\npossibly indicating that the inflammatory response following implantation in vivo does not \n\nachieve such a low pH or does not sustain this low pH for as long as the previously \n\nperformed in vitro study [2]. \n\nThis study also examined the effect of the addition of starch into the chitosan phase \n\ncompared with chitosan scaffolds alone. The presence of starch in addition to chitosan \n\nseems to accelerate the degradation of scaffolds compared to that of chitosan alone (Figure \n\n2). Starch is degraded by ?-amylase, an enzyme also present in the human body namely in \n\nthe human blood [40]. Starch granules with 5-10 \u00b5m dimensions were homogeneously \n\ndistributed throughout the chitosan matrix enhancing hydrolysis by enzymes existing in vivo, \n\nnamely lysozyme and ?-amylase [1]. The pore size and distribution in the scaffold are \n\ncontrolled by the location of the \u201csacrifice\u201d phase (starch), the degradation of which increases \n\nthe microporosity by the release of starch granules (small dots visible at high magnifications \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

After 3 weeks post-\n\nimplantation, degradation was observed in 3D images for chitosan-based formulations \n\ncompared with controls (Figure 3). After 6 weeks, results indicated increased degradation for \n\nall the materials. The trend towards an accelerated increase in porosity/degradation was \n\nobserved for all conditions up to week 12. Nevertheless, analysis of the 3D images did not \n\nindicate a remarkable effect for the presence of lysozyme in chitosan scaffolds, but there did \n\nappear to be enhanced degradation after 6 and 12 weeks when lysozyme was incorporated \n\nin CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds (Figure 3). Furthermore, the CaP coating (dark grey) was \n\nobserved in 3D images at all time points for CaP coated scaffolds, indicating the \n\naforementioned lack of coating degradation as was seen in vitro  (Figure 3). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

This condition (CaPCS + lysozyme) \n\npresented significant higher porosity (p<0.05) compared with chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS) \n\n(43% \u00b1 7 and 27% \u00b1 4, respectively). Lysozyme seems to positively enhance porosity after 6 \n\nweeks of implantation, corroborating the weight loss results (Figure 2). After 3 weeks, no \n\nsignificant differences were found for all studied groups when compared with the porosity of \n\nthe control (non-implanted) samples. However, after 6 weeks of implantation, porosity \n\nsignificantly increased for chitosan (CH), chitosan/starch (CS) and CaP chitosan/starch \n\nscaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS + lysozyme) (Figure 4A). The same trend was \n\nobserved after 12 weeks of implantation, showing significantly higher porosity for all scaffolds \n\ncompared to that of control samples. These results indicate that all groups have the ability to \n\nform pores in situ as a function of implantation time. All groups presented a significantly \n\nincreasing porosity over time ranging at least from 22% (chitosan/starch scaffolds with an \n\ninitial porosity of 10 \u00b1 8% increased after 12 weeks to 32 \u00b1 10%)  up to 32% observed for \n\nCaPCS+lysozyme with 9 \u00b1 5% prosity before implantation and 43 \u00b1 7% after 6 weeks.  The \n\ndegradation and consequently the porosity is expected to be greater for longer implantation \n\ntimes. Furthermore, results suggested that lysozyme positively affected pore formation by \n\nenhancing porosity in the case of chitosan/starch scaffolds.  \n\nThe interconnectivity of chitosan (CH) scaffolds significantly increased with increased \n\nimplantation time when compared to the interconnectivity of control samples (Figure 4B). No \n\nsignificant differences in interconnectivity were observed between groups at the same time \n\npoint. After 12 weeks all groups demonstrated an increase in interconnectivity with the \n\nexception of chitosan/starch scaffolds and CaPCS + lysozyme. Lysozyme seems to have no \n\neffect on interconnectivity; however, interconnectivity increased for all groups over time with \n\na range of values from 24-31% and 43-79%, before and after 12 weeks implantation, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

Microscopic analysis \n\nAt retrieval of the implants, no macroscopic signs of infection were seen at the \n\nsurgical sites (Figure 1C). Furthermore, no adverse tissue reactions (toxic effects) were \n\nobserved with light microscopy. Specimens for microscopy were retrieved at 3, 6 and 12 \n\nweeks post-implantation. Polymer and CaP coating degradation and cellular ingrowth within \n\nthe implants were assessed using histological techniques. Remaining scaffolds were easily \n\nidentified after H&amp;E staining, as chitosan and chitosan/starch stained red, and cells stained \n\nblue and pink. In Figure 5, CaP coatings are not easily identified (appear in dark blue/black) \n\nbut in order to specifically stain calcium, several sections were stained with von Kossa \n\n(Figure 7). For all scaffold formulations, even at the earliest implantation time, the formation \n\nof pores and the infiltration of cells throughout the scaffolds (clearly visible at high \n\nmagnifications) were evident (Figure 5). Degradation of scaffolds within the initially almost \n\nnon-porous network of chitosan or chitosan/starch is evident through the presence of circular \n\nor irregular structures (pores) filled with cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, as a function of \n\nimplantation time, scaffolds have changed their shape and size, meaning that the scaffolds \n\nhave been degraded and subsequently resorbed (Figure 5). The infiltration of cells as a \n\nfunction of time is clearly visible (Figure 6A), and occurred mainly when lysozyme was \n\npresent. The progression of in vivo degradation was also evident by the formation of pores \n\n(Figure 5). The increased scoring of degradation, especially when lysozyme was present, \n\ncorroborated these data (Figure 6B). The degradation of scaffolds did not elicit a severe \n\ninflammatory response. For the success of a bone tissue engineering implant, the scaffold \n\nmust have a rate of degradation that corresponds to the rate of new bone ingrowth. This \n\nstrategy seems to be very useful since the ideal scaffold should have appropriate mechanical \n\nproperties for the site of implantation. It was previously demonstrated that in both dry and wet \n\nstates these CaP coated chitosan scaffolds have appropriate mechanical properties for bone \n\napplications [1].  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

(**) indicates a significant difference (p &lt;0.05) between the same condition at \n\ndifferent time points. \n\n \n\nDuring resorption, the degradation products of CaP coatings (calcium and phosphate \n\nions) are naturally metabolized and do not induce abnormal calcium and phosphate levels in \n\nurine, serum, or organs [41, 42]. The dissolution of CaP coatings depends on the particle \n\nsize, crystallographic features, density and the nature of the solution used to make the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n205 \n\ncoating (composition, pH and temperature) [42, 43]. Highly soluble and poorly crystalline \n\ncoatings might accelerate the dissolution process and consecutively favor osteoconduction \n\n[44]. These CaP coatings are partially amorphous and quite stable at pH 7.4 [2]. Figure 7 \n\nshows von Kossa stained sections with CaP coating that remained on or within the implants. \n\nThe material is stained in grey, cells in pink and CaP coating in black. All sections, with the \n\nexception of the controls (without CaP coatings), have black regions around or within the \n\nimplants, meaning that the CaP coating did not dissolve completely. Signs of degradation of \n\nCaP coating were evident in Figure 7 but some CaP coating remained on the implants. \n\nThese results are corroborated by 3D images obtained with ?-CT (Figure 3). Complete loss \n\nof the coatings was not observed (Figure 7), as illustrated in 3D images obtained by ?-CT \n\n(Figure 3). Furthermore, we can state that in vivo the pH did not seem to decrease to 5 \n\nbecause these biomimetic CaP coatings are soluble at pH 5 or below as it was demonstrated \n\npreviously [2]. Or, perhaps the pH did drop below 5 but not for a sufficiently long period of \n\ntime to dissolve the coatings. Von Kossa stained sections also support the H&amp;E results and \n\nhistological scoring showing pronounced implant degradation as a function of implantation \n\ntime and infiltration of cells throughout the implants (Figures 6 and 7). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy \nfor Bone Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\n207 \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn vivo degradation of all specimens was clearly demonstrated by weight loss \n\nmeasurements, porosity increase, and images of H&amp;E stained sections where there were \n\nvisible pores completely filled with cells. Porosity significantly increased after 12 weeks of \n\nimplantation, ranging from 22% up to 32% for all conditions. This strategy, using \n\nbiodegradable naturally occurring polymers such as chitosan and starch, seems to maintain \n\nstructural support throughout the implantation period tested, with the formation of pores in \n\nsitu allowing for the penetration of cells into the implants. The gradual in situ pore forming \n\nability of chitosan-based scaffolds was clearly demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, this \n\napproach is very promising since incorporated lysozyme has antibacterial properties and \n\nCaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds can simultaneously exhibit osteoconductive properties. \n\nWhile further in vivo characterization within an orthotopic site is needed, these findings \n\nindicate that in situ pore-forming CaP coated chitosan-based materials have potential for \n\nfuture use in bone tissue engineering applications.   \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Goreti Pinto, Lu\u00eds Martins and Deolinda \n\nTeixeira (Life and Health Sciences Research Institute \u2013 University of Minho, Portugal) for \n\nexcellent technical assistance on histological sectioning and microscopy analysis; the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for the Postdoctoral Grant to \n\nCatarina M.

General Conclusions and Final Remarks \n\n217 \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS \n\nThe main aims of the developed studies reported in this thesis were the successful \n\nuse of natural based scaffolds by means of applying two main bone tissue engineering \n\nstrategies. The experimental work presented in this thesis is divided in two main parts: 1) \n\nThe first strategy involves the culture of cells onto natural-based scaffolds with osteogenic \n\nmedia supplemented with several enzymes that mimic the physiological concentrations, \n\nunder static cultures and flow perfusion conditions (Section 3); 2) The second strategy \n\ndescribes the development and applications of naturally derived scaffolds, based on chitosan \n\nand starch, and validation of in situ pore forming concept in vitro and in vivo  (Section 4).   \n\n \n\nIn the first part of this thesis (Section 3), we have used SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds known \n\nto be degraded by enzymes present in the human blood serum, namely ?-amylase and \n\nlipase. Culture of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) on flow perfusion conditions enhances \n\ndifferentiation of marrow stromal cells with subsequent formation of a bone-like extracellular \n\nmatrix. This work intended to mimic the in vitro and in vivo degradation of the starch/poly(?-\n\ncaprolactone) (SPCL) fiber meshes using enzymes responsible for their degradation at the \n\nsame concentrations as those found in human serum. Besides characterizing the \n\nsusceptibility of SPCL fiber meshes to enzymatic degradation, this study aimed also to \n\ninvestigate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and subsequent formation of extracellular \n\nmatrix (ECM) under static and flow perfusion conditions in the presence of hydrolytic \n\nenzymes (lipase and/or ?-amylase). The degradation studies performed in static and \n\ndynamic conditions demonstrated the effect of lipase and ?-amylase on degradation of SPCL \n\nfiber mesh scaffolds, showing that after 30 days these enzymes did not have a negative \n\neffect on SPCL fiber integrity. Lipase had a positive effect on the porosity and size of pores \n\nwhen dynamic conditions were used. Porosity and pore size were also enhanced by ?-\n\namylase. When SPCL fiber meshes were cultured with osteogenic media supplemented with \n\nseveral enzymes in static and flow perfusion conditions, the following was concluded: \n\n- culture media supplemented with ?-amylase or lipase revealed that these enzymes \n\npromoted the proliferation MSCs on SPCL when cultured under static conditions \n\n- cuture media supplemented with lipase and with both ?-amylase and lipase enzymes \n\nenhanced the proliferation MSCs when cultured on SPCL on flow perfusion \n\nbioreactors \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. General Conclusions and Final Remarks \n\n \n\n218 \n\n- lipase had a superior effect in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and on the \n\nmineralization of the extracellular matrix when added to osteogenic culture medium \n\nas compared with the results obtained without enzymes or with ?-amylase or both \n\nenzymes together under static and flow perfusion conditions. \n\n- flow perfusion culture dramatically improved the distribution of ECM through the \n\ncultured scaffolds and mineralized matrix production. \n\nThese results demonstrated that supplementation of culture media with lipase holds great \n\npotential for the generation of bone tissue engineering constructs from MSCs seeded onto \n\nSPCL fiber mesh scaffolds under static or flow perfusion conditions. Lipase enhanced the \n\nosteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promoted matrix mineralization without \n\ndeleteriously affecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. \n\n \n\nIn Section 4, the second part of experimental results of this thesis, we have proposed \n\nnovel responsive scaffolds based on chitosan and starch with an in situ pore forming ability. \n\nThe results of the compressive tests showed that these materials exhibited mechanical \n\nproperties that fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus for trabecular bone. \n\nDegradation studies using ?-amylase and lysozyme with similar concentrations to those \n\nfound in human serum were selected in order to simulate the physiological conditions and \n\nsubsequently assess pore formation. It was demonstrated that these scaffolds were \n\nsusceptible to these enzymes and were able to degrade and to induce the formation of pores \n\nusing enzymatic physiological concentrations. Biocompatibility studies showed that the \n\nextracts of the scaffolds were non cytotoxic.    \n\nSince the formation of pores in the presence of lysozyme in conditions similar to those \n\nfound in human blood serum was only moderate compared to those obtained with ?-amylase \n\nor with the two enzymes together (?-amylase and lysozyme), an alternative approach was \n\nselected to improve these results. The alternative was to incorporate lysozyme at high \n\nconcentrations in CaP coatings prepared at the surface of these materials. Our hypothesis \n\nproposed that a biomimetic CaP coating would further enhance the in vivo performance of \n\nusing a CaP coating since these materials, which per se are not osteoinductive and \n\nosteoconductive. Degradation studies at pH 7.4, to simulate normal physiological conditions, \n\nshowed that in these conditions, CaP coatings are very stable as the materials remained \n\ncovered with a CaP layer. At pH 5, to simulate an in vivo inflammatory response, a porous \n\nstructure was formed when lysozyme was incorporated into the CaP coatings. The \n\ndegradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan scaffolds at pH 5 was clearly visible by the \n\nappearance of pores.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. General Conclusions and Final Remarks \n\n219 \n\nDegradation studies performed with lysozyme using similar concentration to those \n\nincorporated into CaP coatings showed the formation of pores as a function of immersion \n\ntime, indicating an increase of porosity from 5% to 55%. Lysozyme had a significant catalytic \n\neffect on chitosan scaffolds resulting in porous 3D structures with interconnected pores \n\n(~78%). On the basis of these studies it was concluded that CaP biomimetic coatings with \n\nincorporated lysozyme enhance osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells. \n\nTherefore, the use of a CaP biomimetic coating strategy with incorporated lysozyme on the \n\nsurface of chitosan-based scaffolds is able to provide an improved environment for rat MSCs \n\ndifferentiation along the osteogenic lineage when compared with uncoated scaffolds. \n\nFinally, to validate the in situ pore forming concept in vivo chitosan-based scaffolds with \n\nor without CaP coating and in the presence and absence of lysozyme, a rat subcutaneous \n\nmodel was used. In vivo degradation of all scaffolds was clearly demonstrated by weight loss \n\nmeasurements, porosity increase, and images of H&amp;E stained sections where were visible \n\npores completely filled out with cells. Porosity significantly increased after 12 weeks ranging \n\nfrom 22% up to 34%. It is expected that for longer implantation times, the degradation and \n\nthe in situ formation of pores will be greater than the obtained in the herein presented studies \n\nperformed up to 12 weeks. These findings indicate the potential that CaP coated chitosan-\n\nbased materials can have in bone tissue engineering applications and further motivates \n\nfuture in vivo studies using an orthotopic model. \n\n \n\nAs final remarks, it can be stated that the work developed and included in this thesis \n\nprovided interesting results on different types of natural based scaffolds and targeted two \n\ndifferent bone tissue engineering strategies. In the first strategy we tried to simulate \n\nphysiologic enzymatic conditions, since the ideal scaffold for bone tissue engineering should \n\nbe biodegradable and bioresorbable while being able to support the growth of new bone. \n\nStatic culture conditions and flow perfusion bioreactor cultures were successfully used in \n\ncombination with enzymes such as ?-amylase and/or lipase on the osteogenic differentiation \n\nof rat bone marrow stromal cells. \n\nLastly, we have proposed the use of a self-regulating degrading material with gradual in \n\nsitu pore formation ability in vitro and in vivo. The success of this approach is mainly dictated \n\nby the presence of lysozyme incorporated into the coatings that will grant chitosan scaffolds \n\nwith a gradual in vivo pore forming ability and antibacterial activity, while the presence of the \n\nCaP coating can simultaneously enable osteoconductive properties to the scaffolds. The \n\ndemonstrated ability of these novel surface coated scaffolds to form an interconnected pore \n\nstructure in situ coupled with their positive effect on the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. General Conclusions and Final Remarks \n\n \n\n220 \n\nand mineralized matrix production clearly illustrate the strong potential of these scaffolds for \n\napplication in bone tissue engineering strategies. These \u201csmart\u201d and responsive scaffolds, \n\nwith in situ pore forming capability and interesting mechanical properties, seem to be \n\nadvantageous when compared with other presently available conventional materials.  \n\n\n\tAna Margarida Martins de Sousa.pdf\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4\n\n\ttese_AnaMartins.pdf\n\tChapter0 catarina_VF\n\tChapterI_Introduction\n\tChapterII_Materials and methods\n\tChapter III_SPCL static\n\tChapter IV_SPCL_FLOW\n\tChapter V_in situ 1\n\tChapter VI_CH_CaP_Acta\n\tChapter VII_CH_MSC_TE\n\tChapter VIII_In vivo\n\tChapter IX_Conclusions"}]}}}
