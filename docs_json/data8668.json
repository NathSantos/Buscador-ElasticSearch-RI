This work, as all scientific studies, didn't \n\ncome from just one person, it's the result of the work and dedication of many, many \n\npeople. \n\nFirstly, the one person to actually give me the idea to do this project, Dr Mark \n\nFernandez. You said I'd feel like hitting you for giving me this idea and I'd feel \n\nfrustrated and desperate at some point and I just laughed, but I want to tell you that you \n\nwere so, so right. It really was a good idea though, so thanks anyway. \n\nI owe a special thanks Dr Colin MacLeod for all the help you gave me, the advice \n\nand replies to all those emails I sent, thank you so much for your patience and kindness. \n\nWithout your help these maps would have never seen the light of day. \n\nI would also like to thank the Sea Watch Foundation staff and volunteers for \n\ngathering all the data throughout the years, specially the 2017 volunteers for period 1. \n\nThose many days at sea and on landwatch were very important for keeping my sanity \n\nwhen computer work started. A very special thanks to Rhodri  and Steph for the help \n\nwith the Arc GIS program, without you I don't know how I would have done those \n\ndamned maps. \n\nTo Professor Peter Evans and Katrin Lohrengel from the SWF for supervising and \n\nproviding all the data necessary for this study to happen. A big thanks for professora \n\nEster Serr\u00e3o from UAlg for looking at my draft. \n\nTo everyone at the MBM in UAlg, particularly Monica, Maya, In\u00eas and Teo for \n\nall the help with the exams and presentations we did and for all the fun we had.  \n\nTo my favourite cousin, Olivier for the help with my computer issues. \n\nA very very heartfelt thanks to whoever wrote the website \n\nhttp://abacus.bates.edu/~ganderso/biology/resources/writing/HTWsections.html, thank \n\nyou so much, you are awesome!! \n\nA great thanks for all the dolphins who let themselves be photographed by the \n\nSWF, believe it or not some of them were not very good dolphins and wouldn't let us \n\nphotograph them, so those who did deserve all the affection I have for them, especially \n\nthe ones bow ridding and staying close to the boat for a long time, they are really nice \n\ngood dolphins.  \n\nLastly, to those people that lost hours and days, if not weeks, trying to give all the \n\nhelp they could, for putting up with me all those years, my parents and my brother. It \n\n\n\niii \n \n\nwas never easy, I know, but they say the hardest things in life are the best. If we all had \n\nto choose a family, I'd never hesitate to choose you three. Thank you for all the support, \n\nall the worries you had for me, for letting me scuba dive and drive my motorbike and all \n\nthat crazy stuff I wanted to do. Most importantly for the support when I was eight and \n\ntold you I wanted to be a marine biologist. You didn't laugh or said I shouldn't do it, you \n\njust supported and encouraged me and I thank the ocean every day for the gift I was \n\ngiven to be part of your family. \n\nTo all this people and maybe some that I'm forgetting, thank you for all the help. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"What is a scientist after all? It is a curious man looking through a keyhole, the \n\nkeyhole of nature, trying to know what's going on.\" \n\nJacques-Yves Cousteau \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\n ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) belongs to \n\nthe sub-order Odontoceti and is one of the most widely distributed species of cetaceans. \n\nWithin this species it is possible to find strict resident populations, semi-resident \n\npopulations or transient communities. The Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphin population \n\nis one of the two semi-resident populations in the United Kingdom. \n\nWith the increasing anthropogenic disturbance, particularly significant for \n\ncetacean communities whose geographic ranges are limited or decreasing, the survival \n\nof a certain population depends a great deal on its habitat. As a result, understanding the \n\nhome range of a population is crucial in order to attempt any protection and monitoring \n\nmeasures. Also known as pattern of residency, the home range is the area where the \n\nindividual spends its time feeding, breeding and nursing the young. \n\nThe purpose of this work is to estimate the home range of the bottlenose dolphin \n\npopulation by comparing different group sets in order to infer if there are any \n\ndissimilarities between the distributions of the selected groups. \n\nUsing photo-identification data from 2007 to 2016 obtained from surveys, \n\ncombined with other information regarding the individuals, Minimum Convex Polygons \n\nand Kernel Density Estimators were calculated and mapped for each group and then \n\ncompared. Both mean home range (95% KDE) and core areas (50% KDE) were \n\ninferred. Mean water depths were also determined for each group. \n\nNo significant differences were obtained for gender, markings in the dorsal fin \n\nand presence or absence of calf. There were, however differences in distribution for the \n\nsummer and winter sightings.  \n\nAdditional important areas for this bottlenose dolphin populations were \n\ndetermined, as well as seasonal differences in distribution. Further surveys are required, \n\nmainly at the areas outside the Special Areas of Conservation in Cardigan Bay. \n\n \n\n \n\nKEY WORDS: Bottlenose dolphin, Home range, Core Area, Kernel density \n\nestimators (KDE), Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP), Cardigan Bay.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nO Golfinho-Roaz comum (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) pertence \u00e0 sub-\n\nordem Odontoceti e \u00e9 uma das esp\u00e9cies de cet\u00e1ceos mais amplamente distribu\u00eddos. Pode \n\nser encontrado em \u00e1guas costeiras e oce\u00e2nicas nas regi\u00f5es tropicais e temperadas dos \n\noceanos e mares. Dentro desta esp\u00e9cie, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel encontrar popula\u00e7\u00f5es residentes, cuja \n\nfaixa residencial \u00e9 limitada a um local espec\u00edfico, residentes sazonais, que s\u00f3 podem \n\ngastar parte do tempo na \u00e1rea e comunidades transit\u00f3rias. A popula\u00e7\u00e3o de golfinhos \n\nroazes de Cardigan Bay (CB), utilizada para este estudo, \u00e9 uma das duas popula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nsemi-residentes no Reino Unido, sendo a outra em Moray Firth, na Esc\u00f3cia. Atualmente \n\nexistem duas \u00c1reas Especiais de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o (SACs) implementadas em Cardigan \n\nBay: o Cardigan Bay SAC e o Pen Ll?n a'r Sarnau SAC. Apesar das constantes medidas \n\nde monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o e prote\u00e7\u00e3o aplicadas, essa popula\u00e7\u00e3o tem sofrido um forte decl\u00ednio \n\ndesde 2007. \n\nCom o aumento do impacto antropog\u00e9nico, particularmente significativo para as \n\ncomunidades de cet\u00e1ceos cujas amplitudes geogr\u00e1ficas s\u00e3o limitadas ou decrescentes, a \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia de uma determinada popula\u00e7\u00e3o depende muito do seu habitat. Como \n\nresultado, a compreens\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es de resid\u00eancia de uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 crucial para \n\ntentar qualquer prote\u00e7\u00e3o e medidas de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Tamb\u00e9m conhecido como padr\u00e3o \n\nde resid\u00eancia, o home range \u00e9 a \u00e1rea onde o indiv\u00edduo gasta o seu tempo a alimentar-se, \n\na reproduzir-se e a criar as crias. \n\nO objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 identificar o home range da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de golfinhos \n\nroazes de CB. Ao comparar diferentes grupos, de acordo com certas caracter\u00edsticas \n\n(g\u00e9nero, data de avistamento, grau de marca\u00e7\u00f5es de barbatanas dorsais e presen\u00e7a de \n\ncrias), \u00e9 poss\u00edvel inferir as \u00e1reas que s\u00e3o mais importadas para cada grupo ou para toda \n\na popula\u00e7\u00e3o, avaliando as desigualdades entre as distribui\u00e7\u00f5es dos grupos selecionados, \n\na fim de verificar quais as medidas que podem ser aplicadas para diminuir o impacto \n\nexercido sobre estes animais. O uso de dados de foto identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de 2007 a 2016 \n\nobtidos a partir de pesquisas, combinadas com outras informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os indiv\u00edduos, \n\nos Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP) e os Kernel Density Estimators (KDE) foram \n\ncalculados e mapeados para cada grupo, sendo depois comparados. O MCP \u00e9 usado para \n\ndelinear a \u00e1rea total onde os animais s\u00e3o encontrados, enquanto o KDE determina quais \n\nas \u00e1reas que s\u00e3o mais utilizadas pela popula\u00e7\u00e3o. O intervalo m\u00e9dio dos padr\u00f5es de \n\nresid\u00eancia, que representa as \u00e1reas sem os locais pouco comuns e  distantes \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nrelativamente \u00e0 \u00e1rea de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o normal do indiv\u00edduo, corresponde a 95% de KDE, \n\nenquanto a core area, que representa as \u00e1reas mais ocupadas pela popula\u00e7\u00e3o, onde \n\nocorreram 50% dos avistamentos, \u00e9 representada por 50% do KDE. Ambos os home \n\nrange m\u00e9dio (95% KDE) e core area (50% KDE) foram inferidos. As profundidades \n\nm\u00e9dias da \u00e1gua tamb\u00e9m foram determinadas para cada grupo. Quanto \u00e0 compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre f\u00eameas e machos, a \u00e1rea total, a m\u00e9dia dos padr\u00f5es de resid\u00eancia obtidos e a core \n\narea foram ligeiramente maiores para os machos e as \u00e1reas de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m \n\nforam semelhantes. Como as diferen\u00e7as n\u00e3o foram significativas, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial \n\n\u00e9 semelhante para ambos os sexos. A maior limita\u00e7\u00e3o foi o maior n\u00famero de f\u00eameas em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00famero de machos estudados.  \n\nO home range relativo aos encontros ocorridos durante os meses mais quentes (1 \n\nde Abril at\u00e9 31 de Outubro - Ver\u00e3o) est\u00e1 localizada principalmente em ambos os SAC e \n\nem menor grau no norte de Anglesey. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, o home range dos meses de \n\nInverno (1 de Novembro at\u00e9 31 de Mar\u00e7o) foi mais dispersa, com menor presen\u00e7a na \n\n\u00e1rea de Cardigan Bay e maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de golfinhos desta popula\u00e7\u00e3o em torno \n\nde Anglesey, perto de Liverpool Bay e da Isle of Man. Estes resultados implicam que a \n\nmaioria dos animais passa o ano em locais completamente diferentes, durante o Inverno \n\nencontram-se no norte e passam o Ver\u00e3o no sul, em Cardigan Bay. \n\nOs golfinhos com barbatanas dorsais bem marcadas foram contrastados com \n\ngolfinhos sem uma barbatana dorsal marcada. As \u00e1reas ocupadas pelos golfinhos sem \n\nmarcas nas barbatanas dorsais sobrepuseram-se com as \u00e1reas ocupadas por indiv\u00edduos \n\nbem marcados. O facto dos animais bem marcados terem uma \u00e1rea estimada maior n\u00e3o \n\nsignifica que eles s\u00e3o mais ou que se expandam em \u00e1reas maiores. Os animais bem \n\nmarcados s\u00e3o muito mais f\u00e1ceis de identificar, enquanto que uma barbatana dorsal n\u00e3o \n\nmarcada \u00e9 muito mais dif\u00edcil de usar como caracter\u00edstica identific\u00e1vel. Deste modo, a \n\n\u00e1rea determinada pelos golfinhos sem marcas vis\u00edveis nas barbatanas dorsais \u00e9 menor \n\ndevido ao menor n\u00famero de identifica\u00e7\u00f5es ocorridas quando os encontros ocorreram. \n\nAs f\u00eameas com crias foram avistadas em locais muito mais pr\u00f3ximos da costa e \n\nmais concentrados nos dois SAC de Cardigan Bay, com algumas f\u00eameas sendo \n\navistadas na costa norte de Anglesey, enquanto que durante os anos sem crias, as f\u00eameas \n\nn\u00e3o eram apenas vistas nesses locais mas tamb\u00e9m em Liverpool Bay e na Isle of Man. A \n\nsobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o indicou que as f\u00eameas com crias n\u00e3o procuram \u00e1reas diferentes das \n\nocupadas por outros golfinhos f\u00eameas sem crias. Em vez disso, as f\u00eameas sem crias \n\ntendem a dispersar-se mais para fora, ocupando toda a \u00e1rea da ba\u00eda, enquanto as f\u00eameas \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\ncom crias tendem a ficar mais perto da costa em locais mais protegidos. Esta \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o foi limitada pelo, por vezes, reduzido n\u00famero de avistamentos de m\u00e3es com \n\ncrias, dado que, em alguns anos, os encontros n\u00e3o eram suficientes para determinar se a \n\nf\u00eamea tinha crias ou n\u00e3o. \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s profundidades, a maioria dos grupos apresentou faixas de \n\nprofundidade semelhantes com desvios padr\u00e3o semelhantes. A \u00fanica diferen\u00e7a not\u00e1vel \n\nfoi a profundidade m\u00e9dia dos avistamentos realizados no Inverno, por\u00e9m a varia\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \n\nfoi significante, pois o valor do desvio padr\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m foi maior para este grupo. Isso \n\npode ser devido ao facto da maioria dos golfinhos estarem localizados fora da \u00e1rea de \n\nCardigan Bay durante o estes meses. Como algumas \u00e1reas em torno de Anglesey s\u00e3o \n\nligeiramente mais profundas do que a \u00e1rea de CB, a profundidade seria ligeiramente \n\nmaior do que nos locais de ver\u00e3o. \n\nNeste estudo foram determinadas \u00e1reas importantes para esta popula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngolfinhos roazes, bem como diferen\u00e7as sazonais na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o. Pesquisas adicionais \n\nser\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias, principalmente fora das \u00c1reas Especiais de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o em Cardigan \n\nBay. \n\n  \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n                                                                                                                                   Page \n\nDeclara\u00e7\u00e3o de autoria de trabalho i \n\nAcknowledgments ii \n\nAbstract iv \n\nResumo v \n\nTable of contents viii \n\nList of Figures x \n\nList of Tables xii \n\nList of Appendices xiii \n\nList of Abbreviations xiv \n\n1 - Introduction 1 \n\n1.1.Cetaceans 2 \n\n1.2.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nDespite being an emblematic and widespread group, small cetaceans are heavily \n\nimpacted by anthropogenic activities (Cheney et al., 2013). The life history \n\ncharacteristics of these animals, since they are K-selected species, as well as the impacts \n\ncaused by human activities on the marine habitats, particularly in near-shore \n\nenvironments, are reasons for their vulnerability (Ross et al., 2011). \n\nHuman disturbance causes a particularly significant impact on cetacean \n\ncommunities whose geographic ranges are limited or decreasing. It is important to \n\nunderstand that the survival of a certain population depends a great deal on its habitat \n\n(Ross et al., 2011). Consequently, understanding the home range of a population is \n\ncrucial in order to attempt any protection and monitoring measures (Ingram and Rogan, \n\n2002; Ross et al., 2011; Dwyer et al., 2016; Sprogis et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs the population is presently declining (Feingold and Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel \n\nand Evans, 2015), more conservation measures are necessary in order to reverse this \n\ntrend, as these animals are being increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities. \n\nThis study aims to estimate the home range of the bottlenose dolphin population \n\nby comparing different group sets in order to infer if there are any dissimilarities \n\nbetween the distributions of the selected groups. By analysing the core areas it is \n\npossible to determine the most important areas to protect, assessing if there are different \n\nareas for opposite groups and how best to manage them, decreasing the pressure exerted \n\non the population. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\n1.1.Cetaceans \n\nThe order Cetacea, comprised of 87 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises \n\n(Hoyt, 2011) is divided into two sub-orders, the Mysticeti (baleen whales) and the \n\nOdontoceti (toothed whales), which include dolphins and porpoises (Evans and Raga, \n\n2012). The two suborders have radiated during the Oligocene from the archaeocetes, \n\nprimitive toothed cetaceans that emerged from terrestrial mammals (Fordyce, 1980). \n\nCetaceans vary in length, from 1.5m to 33m and inhabit marine ecosystems, \n\nalthough some species can be found in lakes and river systems. Having descended from \n\nmammals, cetaceans share certain traits with their terrestrial relatives, such as being air-\n\nbreathing homeotherms (Alves, 2013). \n\nThese aquatic mammals are well adapted to living in aquatic ecosystems, with a \n\nstreamline shaped body, flat paddle-shaped forelimbs and no external hindlimbs, having \n\na horizontal tail - the fluke. In some species it is possible to find a dorsal fin. The nasal \n\nopening is located on top of the head in addition to reduced appendages (internal \n\nreproductive organs as well as internal ears) in order to decrease the water resistance \n\n(Fordyce, 1980; Evans and Raga, 2012; Jefferson et al., 1993). Furthermore, insulation \n\nis provided through a thick layer of sub-dermal fat named blubber, allowing these \n\nanimals to occupy a wide variety of temperatures, from 2\u00baC to over 30\u00baC (Evans and \n\nRaga, 2012; Alves, 2013). \n\nDespite all this similarities, there are quite a few differences between the two sub-\n\norders. The mysticetes are often larger than the toothed whales and possess baleen \n\nplates, a feeding apparatus that allows the animal to filter prey organisms present in the \n\nwater column. On the other hand, odontocetes feed on individual large food items, such \n\nas fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, using their teeth. Exceptions can be found, as \n\nthese do not erupt through the gums of the females of the family Ziphiidae (Fordyce, \n\n1980; Evans and Raga, 2012). \n\nThe other main distinction regards the nasal cavity, known as blowhole. \n\nMysticetes have two blowholes, whereas odontocetes only possess one (Jefferson et al., \n\n1993; Evans and Raga, 2012).  \n\nDiverse studies have been conducted in order to gather knowledge on these \n\nanimals, however, in opposition to terrestrial animals, aquatic mammals are not \n\nfrequently visible, since they spend most of their time underwater (Gowans et al.,2007). \n\nTheir aquatic lifestyle presents a challenge for scientific studies, as it is often \n\ncomplicated to observe or detect the animals. Moreover, these species are highly mobile \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nand may occupy a wide geographical area, including sometimes great depths. Most \n\nresearch studies are concentrated in small areas, which can hinder the possibility to \n\ngather information if the animals occur in a greater range or even in neighbouring \n\ncountries (Evans and Hammond, 2004; Alves, 2013; Nuuttila et al., 2013). \n\nIn addition, the large body size, fragility, endangered status and the high levels of \n\npublic attention towards these aquatic mammals can lead to a more demanding way to \n\nacquire knowledge from cetaceans (Alves, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. The bottlenose dolphin  \n\nThe common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) belongs to \n\nthe sub-order Odontoceti and is one of the most widely distributed species of cetaceans \n\n(Fig. 1). It can be found in both coastal and oceanic waters in the tropical and temperate \n\nregions of oceans and seas. Some populations reside in rivers and estuaries (Gregory \n\nand Rowden, 2001; Santos et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is probably the most recognised species of cetaceans, featuring in several \n\nmovies and due to its captivity in zoos and dolphinariums. Despite this, there has been a \n\ndebate in the scientific community regarding the systematics of this genus. Presently, \n\nthe genus Tursiops consists of three distinct species: Tursiops truncatus, T. aduncus and \n\nT. australis (Connor et al., 2000; Charlton-Robb et al., 2011). \n\nFigure 1 - Map with the distribution of the common \n\nbottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in grey. \n\nSource: Perrin et al., 2009, p.251  \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nMembers of this species display great variation in size and coloration. Adults can \n\nmeasure between 1.9 to 4.1meters and weigh between 150 to 650kg, with the males \n\ntypically slightly larger than the females. Coloration can range between dark gray to \n\nlight grey with a white belly (Fig.2). Individuals are usually found in groups (Shirihai, \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this species, two disparate strategies have been considered: the coastal resident \n\npopulations and the wide ranging oceanic populations. In resident populations, since the \n\namount of prey and resources available is relatively small, large groups would be \n\ndisadvantageous. For that reason, group size in these communities is reduced, leading to \n\nlower competition for food. Since these populations inhabit locations with lower risk of \n\npredation, safety in numbers is not a necessity. On the other hand, oceanic groups have \n\na tendency to expand over large areas, as prey availability is often irregular and in low \n\nconcentration. Frequently, these communities must rely on a big group, as refuge from \n\npredators is scarce and prey schools tend to concentrate in small regions, with large \n\nareas without any food available. In both these cases, a large community provides \n\nprotection and increases foraging and ability to catch prey (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; \n\nGowans et al., 2007).  \n\nIt is, however, quite complicated to conclude with certainty the strategies and \n\npatterns of movement of the oceanic groups, as the act of studying them is complex, \n\nparticularly considering its large area of distribution. Furthermore, offshore bottlenose \n\ncommunities have a tendency to present a dissimilar social structure, exhibiting \n\nFigure 2 - Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Source: Ana \n\nRita Correia/CRRU. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nrelatively lower low-term associations and greater ranges (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; \n\nGowans et al., 2007). \n\nGowans et al (2007) have also referred that, based on genetic studies, inshore and \n\noffshore ecotypes display marked genetic differences. For that reason, both are isolated \n\nfrom each other on a reproductive level.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. Group living in bottlenose dolphins \n\nWhen encountering members of the species Tursiops truncatus, it is possible to \n\nobserve several individuals. Like most delphinids, these animals form groups or pods. A \n\ngroup is a set of individuals that display stronger associations amongst each other than \n\nwith the other members of the population over large periods of time (Connor et al., \n\n1998). \n\nThere are several advantages in forming groups such as the decrease in mortality \n\ndue to predation, increase in detection and acquisition of prey and other resources and a \n\nbigger amount of individuals for reproduction. Moreover, the probability of acquiring \n\nknowledge through learning and social interactions increases when an individual is \n\ninserted in a group (Gowans et al., 2007).  \n\nHowever, group living may increase competition for food and other resources as \n\nwell as probability of spreading certain illnesses or parasites (Gowans et al., 2007). \n\nDespite the existence of a few disadvantages, grouping is quite common in \n\ncetaceans. In fact, Connor et al (2000) refers that all populations of bottlenose dolphins \n\nappear to form what was called fission-fusion groups. In this grouping strategy, \n\nassociations formed between different animals often change in composition for small \n\nperiods of time.  \n\nDepending on the activity in progress at the time, different groups may be \n\ndefined, nevertheless each individual can be considered to be in more than one \n\nsimultaneously (Gowans et al., 2007). One example could be of a nursery group, where \n\nseveral females have grouped to take care of calves, that join a feeding group. \n\nThe decrease or absence of competition is quite beneficial for the success of the \n\ngroup or groups and cooperation can exist even when the animals are not related to each \n\nother (Gowans et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n1.4. Photo-identification \n\nPhoto identification is a method based on the analysis of photographs whose goal \n\nis to identify and recognise different individuals (Fig.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson (1990) studies comparing natural marks in \n\ncetaceans have started in the early 1970's.  \n\nOne main advantage to using this particular method is that it does not harm the \n\nanimals sampled. It also provides an array of information with a relatively low cost \n\n(Evans and Hammond, 2004). \n\nPhoto-identification can be useful in assessing movement and population \n\nparameters, namely life history information, such as age of sexual maturity, \n\nreproductive and total life span, calving intervals, length of nursing, and, in some cases, \n\nmortality and disease rates. Group composition and behaviour of the population is \n\npossible to be inferred when all the individuals are accounted for. Area distribution as \n\nwell as short term movement patterns and migrations are also possible to be determined, \n\nFigure 3 - Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) dorsal fins for photo-\n\nidentification purposes. a and b are photos of dolphin 014-94W (Gandalf); c and d \n\ncorrespond to dolphin 152-05W. Photo a was taken on July 15\nth\n, 2003. Photo b was taken on \n\nMay 24\n th\n\n, 2017. Photo c was taken on August 14\n th\n\n, 2016. Photo d was taken on August 6\n th\n\n, \n\n2009. Source: Katrin Lohrengel, SWF. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nwhen the photo-identification occurs in different locations (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990; \n\nEvans and Hammond, 2004; Connor and Krutzen, 2015).  \n\nReliable data must be attained for these studies, in order to avoid getting biased \n\ninformation. The natural marks used for the recognition of the animal must be \n\ndiscernible over time as well as be unique to that specific individual. In most cases this \n\ncondition is easily met, since most marks will seldom change beyond recognition even \n\nwhen other marks appear in the dorsal fin/fluke. In addition, most marks will be present \n\nthroughout the individual's lifetime (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990; Evans and Hammond, \n\n2004). \n\nAnother consideration when photographing the individuals is that most dolphins \n\nor whales acquire marks or nicks as they get older, hence the probability to recognise a \n\ncalf or a juvenile is much lower. Fortunately, marks tend to appear as the individual gets \n\nolder, improving the possibilities of identification (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990). \n\nDespite most photo-identification work only accounting for the marks, nicks and \n\namputations present in flukes or dorsal fins as well as its shape, some studies (Katona \n\nand Whitehead, 1981; W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990; Hartman et al., 2014) have pointed \n\nout other ways to positively identify cetaceans, such as using pectoral fins in order to \n\nidentify Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), as well as pigment patterns in \n\ndifferent species of whales. In addition, shading of the fin and upper body, wounds and \n\nforeign objects present in the animal can be useful when recognising a specific \n\nindividual. One trait more commonly found in the Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) is \n\nthe scarification pattern present on the animal's dorsal fins and bodies.  \n\nDespite all the different characteristics, all these must be identifiable and \n\nincluding poor quality photographs may lead to animals not being recognized or \n\ncorrectly named. Even when the photographs have a good quality, not all animals in the \n\npopulation may bear distinguishable markings along with the fact that in some species \n\nmost individuals do not hold natural lasting marks or scars. (Evans and Hammond, \n\n2004). \n\nMoreover, other approaches have been used in order to collect the same type of \n\ninformation as the one gathered through photo-identification. Some whale species have \n\nbeen identified from airplanes, however delphinids are not possible to identify using this \n\nmethod. Another method used is underwater acoustics, which does not require \n\nvisualisation of the animals. However, the animals must be vocalising for this method to \n\nbe successfully employed and some species only do so throughout specific times of the \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nyear. Underwater photography is also a potentially important method, as the animals are \n\nmore frequently under water (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990; Evans and Hammond, 2004). \n\nDespite having some disadvantages, photo-identification can be applied to several \n\nstudies, such as habitat preference (MacLeod et al., 2007). By understanding the \n\nspecies' habitat preference, it may be possible to predict its response to changes of the \n\nenvironment, mitigating the impact of human interactions with cetaceans. Another use \n\nof employing photo-identification is to ascertain home range as well as determining \n\nresident and non-resident cetacean populations (Hartman et al., 2014; Hartman et al., \n\n2015). Additionally, mark-recapture methods applied to photo-identification are \n\nfrequently used in monitoring programs, often improving conservation efforts (Evans \n\nand Hammond, 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5. Home range \n\nBurt (1943) has defined home range, also known as pattern of residency, as the \n\narea where the individual spends its time feeding, breeding and nursing the young \n\n(Defran et al., 1999; Ingram and Rogan, 2002).  \n\nIn the past this concept has been used in studies of terrestrial mammals (Ingram \n\nand Rogan, 2002), however residence patterns have increasingly been used to determine \n\nimportant habitats for populations of aquatic mammals (Dinis et al., 2016). \n\nNevertheless, not all species and even populations of the same species will occupy \n\nthe same exact locations: some populations can use the same home range for decades \n\nand other populations may display temporary or seasonal migrations away from the \n\narea. Sometimes it is even possible to find different home ranges for different \n\nindividuals in the same geographical area (Defran et al., 1999).  \n\nIn bottlenose dolphins, it is possible to find strict resident populations, whose \n\nhome range is limited to a specific location, seasonal residents, which may only spend a \n\nportion of time in the area and transient communities (Papale et al., 2016).  \n\nUsing location data, the home range can be estimated through two simple widely \n\napplied methods: MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon) and KDE (Kernel Density). MCP \n\nis used to outline the total area where the animals are found. However, this approach \n\ntends to overestimate the home range, as it builds a convex polygon of the area used, \n\nassuming that the animals use this area equally. Odd locations, far away from the \n\nnormal area used will induce a biased home range, as MCP does not take into account \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nthat most animals tend to spend more time in some areas than other (Anderson, 1982; \n\nMacLeod, 2013; Sprogis et al., 2016).  \n\nIn order to determine which areas are more frequently used by the population a \n\ndifferent method must be applied. The KDE assumes the areas with a greater number of \n\nsightings are more important for the individuals than the areas with low density of \n\nrecords. In this approach, 50% and 95% KDE polygons are created. Mean home range, \n\nthat represents the areas without the odd locations far away from the individual's normal \n\nrange, corresponds to 95% KDE whereas the core area, which stands for the most \n\noccupied areas by the population, where 50% of the total number of sightings occurred, \n\nis represented by 50% KDE (Anderson, 1982; Hauser et al., 2007; MacLeod, 2013). \n\nThe original KDE was used for populations within study areas that did not contain \n\nany barriers to movement. For offshore cetacean species, whose habitat allows them to \n\nmove freely, this method can be used. However, for coastal cetacean population, such as \n\nthe Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphins, this implies an overestimation of the home range, \n\nas the coastline acts as a barrier to the movement. In order to avoid a biased home range \n\nestimation the method used must take into account the presence of barriers in the study \n\narea (MacLeod, 2013; Sprogis et al., 2016). \n\nOther than the presence of barriers to the movements of the animals, home range \n\nmay be affected by physical habitat features, such as depth, variability in climate, \n\ntemperature, salinity, tidal cycles and other ocean processes (Ingram and Rogan, 2002; \n\nHauser et al., 2007). \n\nIndividuals use their home range to gather food and other resources, to avoid \n\npredators and attain conditions for their survival. Therefore, home range is not a fixed \n\nlocation in time. Ecological conditions may alter, causing modifications on the \n\ndistribution patterns with the goal to increase the group's chances of survival and \n\nreproductive success (Lusseau, 2005; Hauser et al., 2007; Powell and Mitchell, 2012).  \n\nThese changes in distribution may also include areas known by the animal, yet \n\nwere not visited before (Powell and Mitchell, 2012). By studying home range, \n\nparticularly in cetaceans, the researcher must take into account not only the areas where \n\nthe animals can be found, but also the social organisation and behaviour of the \n\npopulations (Hauser et al., 2007).  \n\nIn an innovative study, Powell and Mitchell (2012) have attempted to determine \n\nhow an individual would perceive its home range and have presumed that a residence \n\npattern originates from a combination of resource availability (the environment) and the \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nanimal's understanding of that environment, its cognitive map. By determining how the \n\nindividual's decision-making process works in regards to changes in the environmental \n\nconditions, home range would be more accurately estimated. \n\nIt is, however, still not possible to determine a home range based on this method. \n\nConsequently, quantitative statistical approaches are presently used. One other \n\ndisadvantage is the dynamism of residency patterns, often altering in a timescale that \n\nwould not allow an effective data collection for its estimation (Powell and Mitchell, \n\n2012). \n\nThere are several methods that can be used to obtain information to estimate a \n\npopulation's home range. Previously, visual data was the main method used (Sveegard \n\net al., 2011). Nevertheless, other techniques started being employed in order to attain \n\nthe same information. These include use of telemetry (Powell and Mitchell, 2012) and \n\nmultiple acoustic methods (Sveegard et al., 2011; Nuuttila et al., 2013). \n\nAlthough a decrease in resource availability can play an important role in shifting \n\na population's home range (Defran et al., 1999; Gowans et al., 2007; Sveegard et al., \n\n2011), anthropogenic disturbance caused by fishery activities as well as overall boat \n\ntraffic and noise are cause for concern regarding the dolphin's welfare. For dolphins, \n\nboat presence could lead to physical injuries from collisions, hearing problems from the \n\nexcessive noise, more time spent foraging due to avoidance of areas with large amounts \n\nof boats (Lusseau, 2005; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Papale et al., 2016). \n\nInformation regarding residency patterns can be applied in conservation and \n\nmanagement efforts of resident populations. By determining the most frequently used \n\nareas for a certain population or group, considered to be the locations where food and \n\nother resources are more abundant, it would be possible to more effectively protect it, \n\ncreating Marine Protected Areas or decreasing anthropogenic impact close to that area \n\n(Sveegard et al., 2011; Hartman et al., 2015).  One example was the creation of the \n\nGully Marine Protected Area, in Nova Scotia due to the presence of a resident \n\npopulation of the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) (Hartman et al., \n\n2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n1.6. The study population \n\nThe Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphin population is one of the two semi-resident \n\npopulations in the United Kingdom, the other being the Moray Firth, in Scotland \n\n(Feingold and Evans, 2014a).  \n\nEstimates of the size of the population vary between 121 and 230 individuals, \n\nwith a greater presence during the summer season. On the other hand, some individuals \n\nkeep being sighted in the bay during the winter months (Feingold and Evans, 2014a). \n\nPrevious studies have determined that several individuals have been moving \n\ntowards the north, mostly at the north coast of Anglesey, with sightings recorded as far \n\nas Liverpool Bay and the Isle of Man during the summer months, which leads to the \n\nconclusion that these dolphins no longer inhabit the Cardigan Bay area during the \n\nsummer (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Feingold and Evans, \n\n2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). \n\nUntil recently the dolphin population was growing in numbers. However, with the \n\nincrease in boat disturbance, the decrease in prey and overall anthropogenic impact the \n\npopulation has suffered a decline (Feingold and Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, \n\n2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7. Objectives \n\nThe present study aims to assess the home range of the bottlenose dolphin \n\npopulation of Cardigan Bay using long-term photo-identification data in order to \n\nimprove the knowledge of this population and contribute for its conservation.  \n\nThe objectives of this study are as follows: \n\n - Compare the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) as well as 50% and 95% \n\nKernel Density Estimators (KDE) of males vs females. \n\n - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of the individuals sighted in \n\nthe summer vs individuals sighted in the winter. \n\n - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of the dolphins without marks \n\nin the dorsal fin vs heavily marked dolphins. \n\n - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of females with calves vs \n\nfemales without calves. \n\n - Determine the mean depths for each group.  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\nThese objectives are designed to answer the following questions: \n\n(1) Do females and males occupy the same areas and where do they stay? \n\n(2) Does the population remain at the same location during the summer and the \n\nwinter? If not, where do they go? \n\n(3) Is there a difference in identification between dolphins with a well-marked \n\ndorsal fin and dolphins without marks in their dorsal fins? \n\n(4) Do bottlenose dolphin mothers stay in different locations with their calves than \n\nwhen they don't have a calf? Is there a place in Cardigan Bay where mothers do not go \n\nwith their calves or a place only mothers and calves go to? \n\n(5) Is there a different depth range for any of the groups previously mentioned?  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n2.1. Study Area \n\nLocated in West Wales, Cardigan Bay is the largest bay of the British Isles with \n\nan estimated area of 5000 km\n2 \n\nmeasuring over 100km between its northern (the Ll?n \n\nPeninsula) and southern boundaries (St David\u2019s Head). It is surrounded by the coastline \n\nof Wales on three sides and opens to the Irish Sea on its western border (Fig.4). Its \n\ngreatest depth reaches about 50 m, however the average depth is approximately 40 \n\nmeters. Its depth increases from east to west with very gentle slopes (Gregory and \n\nRowden, 2001; Anon, 2007; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCardigan Bay is relatively sheltered, having calm waters, particularly at small \n\nembayments within the bay. Salinity is greater in the south and lower near the coast due \n\nto freshwater input from rivers and rainfall (Anon, 2007). \n\nThe seabed of the bay is diverse in its nature, being comprised of sand and broken \n\nshells, gravel, shingle and mud (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; Anon, 2007). \n\nBoat traffic is frequent, mainly in the summer months, with tourist activities such \n\nas water sports and recreational boat trips, with wildlife boat trips actively chasing the \n\nsemi-resident population of bottlenose dolphins present in the bay (Gregory and \n\nRowden, 2001). \n\nFigure 4 - Map of the study area: Cardigan Bay, Wales. \n\nAnglesey \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nUnder the European Community's Habitats Directive, two Special Areas of \n\nConservation (SACs) were implemented in Cardigan Bay: the Cardigan Bay SAC in the \n\nsouth and the Pen Ll?n a\u2019r Sarnau SAC in the north (Fig.5). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed in 1996, both officially started in 2004, with the main purpose of \n\nprotecting the marine wildlife present in both areas (Anon, 2007; Evans and Pesante, \n\n2008; Pierpoint et al., 2009) \n\nThe Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation is located from the Teifi Estuary \n\nto Aberaeron. It has approximately 960km\n2 \n\nand its primary objective is to protect the \n\nsemi-resident bottlenose dolphin population as well as other species and habitat \n\nfeatures, such as the Atlantic Grey Seal (Halichoerus grypus), the River Lamprey \n\n(Lamptera fluviatilis), the Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), reefs, submerged sea \n\nbanks and submerged or partially submerged sea caves (Anon, 2007; Evans and \n\nPesante, 2008; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  \n\nThe Pen Ll?n a\u2019r Sarnau Special Area of Conservation, between the Dovey \n\nEstuary and around the Lleyn Peninsula, has an estimated area of 1460km\n2\n. Originally \n\ndesigned to protect mostly habitat features, such as estuaries, reefs, shallow bays and \n\ninlets, mudflats and subtidal sand banks, as well as the European Otter (Lutra lutra) it \n\nFigure 5 - Map of the two Special Areas of Conservation in \n\nCardigan Bay, Wales (Cardigan Bay SAC and Pen Ll?n a\u2019r \n\nSarnau SAC). \n\nIrish Sea \n\nCardigan \n\nBay \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nlater encompassed the Bottlenose Dolphin (Pen Ll?n cSAC Plan, 2001; Evans and \n\nPesante, 2008; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  \n\n \n\n2.2. Data collection, treatment and analysis \n\nThe dataset used in this study was collected by the Sea Watch Foundation (SWF) \n\nbetween 2007 and 2016. Land-based and boat-based surveys were conducted \n\nthroughout the year in Cardigan Bay, around the coast of Anglesey, in Liverpool Bay \n\nand at the Isle of Man.  \n\nSurveys occurred mainly between April and October, however there have been \n\nsightings in other months, particularly in the north of Anglesey.  \n\nWhile collecting data, environmental conditions need to be favourable, with sea \n\nstate 3 or less, the visibility must be over 1.5km and absence of precipitation (Lohrengel \n\nand Evans, 2015).  \n\nBoat-based data was collected from dedicated line transect surveys aboard \n\nmotorised vessels with members of the SWF as well as trained volunteers. The line \n\ntransects had been previously defined (Figures 6 and 7) and are chosen at random at the \n\nbeginning of each survey.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Map of the inner and outer transects to be selected at random at \n\nthe beginning of each line transect survey conducted in the Cardigan Bay \n\nSAC.

Environmental data such as visibility, \n\nprecipitation, glare, sea state and swell are recorded on the effort forms every 15 \n\nminutes. Other information such as boat speed and course, location coordinates and \n\npresence or absence of other vessels in the area is also registered (Fig. 3.1 - Appendix \n\nIII). When bottlenose dolphins are present, effort must be done every three minutes. \n\nData recorded includes location (geographical coordinates), behaviour, group size and \n\ncomposition, video and underwater video recordings. Occasionally, underwater acoustic \n\ndata and drone footage can also be attained. Information such as the distance from the \n\nboat, first cue the observer spotted (dorsal fin, fluke, back, head, blow,...), reaction to \n\nthe boat and the angle where the animal was first spotted is also part of the data \n\ncollected. \n\nPhoto-identification is also carried out, when possible, both in the line transect \n\nand the ad libitum surveys. The latter are conducted when weather conditions are not \n\nideal or aboard wildlife watching vessels. Photographs were taken using a Canon EOS \n\n40D or a Canon EOS 7D camera body with 18-200mm, 18-300mm or 75-300mm \n\nFigure 7- Map of the transects to be selected at random at the \n\nbeginning of each line transect survey conducted in the Pen Ll?n \na\u2019r Sarnau SAC.  Souce: Lohrengel and Evans (2015). \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\ntelephoto zoom lens (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). The trips aboard the whale watching \n\nvessels are only carried out at the near-shore area of the Cardigan Bay SAC. \n\nOn land-based surveys it is necessary to document the number of animals (adults \n\nand calves) that can be seen along with the location they were first spotted. \n\nAdditionally, all boat encounters must be registered as well as the distance of the \n\nanimals to the boats. The number of vessels present in the water is another feature that \n\nmust be written down. \n\nAll research was carried out under licence from Natural Resources Wales and \n\nfollowing all the rules regarding interactions with cetaceans.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter the encounters, all data is treated. Each dorsal fin photograph must have \n\nenough quality so that it can be used to confidently identify the individual. If this is not \n\npossible, the photo must be deleted. After the photographs are determined to have \n\nsufficient quality, each one is given a code. An example of the code is \n\n160124_001_dunbar_RCO_001, where 160124 is the date (year 2016, on January 24\nth\n\n), \n\n001 represents the encounter number, dunbar is the name of the boat (when the survey \n\nis land-based, this should be replaced with \"land\"), RCO corresponds the initials of the \n\nphotographer (Rita COrreia) and the last three numbers stand for the consecutive order \n\nof the photograph. \n\nAfter the photographs are batch renamed, they must be cropped in order to obtain \n\na photograph that shows the fin and any scars present on the body that could be used to \n\nmore easily identify the individual. All pictures of the same individual must be given \n\nthe same code at the beginning of the name. \n\nThe dorsal fin is then compared with the photographs catalogued. There are three \n\ndifferent catalogues: two containing all the unmarked dorsal fins, divided into the left \n\nand right catalogues, corresponding to the side represented in the photograph. The third \n\ncatalogue is divided into two sub-catalogues, the well-marked and the slightly marked. \n\n After a match is found or the animal is not on the catalogue, it must be validated. \n\nThe validation process will be completed by someone else, in order to have certainty \n\nthat the identification is correct. Afterwards, the sighting information is stored to be \n\nused for future studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nIn this study the dataset had the following information: name, sex, date of sighting \n\nand geographic coordinates. All sightings from the marked catalogue were used, \n\nhowever, in order to prevent using the same animal more than once, only data from the \n\nleft catalogue was analysed.  \n\nAll dolphins not sighted a minimum of 4 years between 2007 and 2016 were \n\nexcluded from the dataset. The individuals had to have seen sighted in at least four \n\ndifferent years in order to insure that these were not transients or occasional visitors.  \n\nAll the dolphins present in the dataset were divided into several different \n\ndatasheets, according to the characteristics analysed. A minimum of 30 sightings were \n\nused for determining home ranges, as done in other studies (Hartman et al., 2014; \n\nHartman et al., 2015), in order to obtain an accurate analysis.  \n\nIn order to compare females and males, the dataset was divided into only females \n\nand only males. Possible females and possible males were excluded from this study, as \n\nsexing is often difficult and no confirmation of these animals' gender could lead to a \n\nbiased home range estimation. \n\nWhen comparing summer and winter, all the sightings were ordered by their date \n\nof occurrence. Sightings between April 1\nst\n and October 31\n\nst\n were classified as summer \n\nsightings. Between November 1\nst\n and March 31\n\nst \noccurred the winter sightings. All \n\ndolphins that did not have both winter and summer sightings were excluded. \n\nIn the well-marked against not-marked study, only the well-marked and the non-\n\nmarked left catalogued individuals in the dataset were included. \n\nAs for the females with calves and females without calves, every female that had \n\nbeen seen next to calf at least 3 times in the same year was considered a mother in that \n\nyear. Only females who had previously been mothers were used in the comparison. \n\nFurthermore, information regarding females and calves from the year 2016 was not \n\navailable for this study, as a result the sightings used occurred between 2007 and 2015.  \n\nAll data was analysed using the ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 software. The geographic \n\ncoordinate system used was WGS 1984 whereas the projected coordinate system was a \n\ncustom Transverse Mercator (Latitude of Origin: 51; Central Meridian: -1). \n\nIn order to calculate the total area used by each group of individuals an MCP \n\n(Minimum Convex Polygon) was estimated (Hartman et al., 2015). Considering the fact \n\nthat cetaceans are exclusively aquatic mammals, all areas of the MCP that fall on land \n\nwere removed. For each group to be compared a map was created and the total area was \n\ncalculated. \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nThe residency patterns are calculated using kernel density estimators (KDE) in \n\norder to determine the distributions and space use of each group (Hauser et al., 2007; \n\nDwyer et al., 2016). Once again, all areas that fall on land must be excluded, making \n\nthis a kernel analysis with barriers. To remove the land from the study a polygon data \n\nlayer, whose coordinate values are as follows: Top: 300000; Right: 90000; Bottom: -\n\n60000; Left: -170000. \n\nSubsequent to attaining the map with the KDE values with barriers, two PVCs \n\n(Percentage Volume Contours) were created for each group of dolphins, the 95%PVC \n\nthat represents the mean home range and the 50%PVC, which corresponds to the core \n\narea (Hauser et al., 2007). Using the 50% and 95% polygons previously created, the \n\nwhole area was then calculated for each different group.  \n\nThe areas for each set of individuals to be compared were combined into a single \n\npolygon in order to determine the overlap between each set of dolphins. Percentage of \n\noverlap was also determine for both methods. \n\nAfter all the comparisons, a water depth raster was added in order to determine the \n\nmean depth for each group, using the 95% PVCs previously attained, with the \n\ndetermination of the mean water depth and standard variation of each group. \n\nThe standard error for each group was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n               \n  \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nwhere    corresponds to the standard deviation obtained and n is the total number \n\nof sightings for the group. \n\nBoth MCP and KDE were determined following MacLeod (2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n \n\nThe main dataset contained a total of 4232 sightings from 189 dolphins. As \n\npreviously stated, the dataset was divided into several groups.

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThe present study has determined the home range of the semi-resident population \n\nof bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay. As previously stated, some of these animals \n\nspend the entirety of their time in the Cardigan Bay (CB) area. However, many \n\nindividuals have been seen outside the bay at some point around the years (Feingold and \n\nEvans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). Taking this into account, I have decided to \n\ninclude the sightings from the north coast of Anglesey, Liverpool Bay and the Isle of \n\nMan, in order to determine the real extent of these dolphin's home range, including \n\nlocations outside the study area. These animals inhabit a specially changeable habitat \n\ndue to the increasing anthropogenic disturbance, hence all data available must be used \n\nin the efforts to improve the conservation measures for this population. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Females vs Males \n\nRegarding the Minimum Convex Polygon comparison between females and males \n\nof the population, the greater area of MCP for the males was mostly caused by a few \n\nsightings of male dolphins between north Anglesey and the Liverpool Bay, as visible in \n\nfigure 9. Further information is required in order to determine if only males are present \n\nin the area or if these sightings correspond to an uncommon occurrence.  \n\n \n\nIn respect to the core area and home range estimation, despite males having larger \n\nareas, these differences were not high enough to be significant, as the percentage of \n\noverlap is similar for both groups. A percentage of overlap of 69.5% means that the area \n\nof overlap constitutes 69.5% of the male's total home range while the females' area of \n\noverlap corresponded to 73% of their total mean home range area. \n\nThus, despite the slight difference in home range areas, males and females do not \n\nseem to use different areas, both inside and outside the bay. These results are in \n\naccordance with a previous masters thesis study on the relationship between \n\nreproductive success and home range (Baylis, 2013). \n\n \n\nThe number of females and males was not proportionate in this study, as fewer \n\nmales were used (16 males and 55 females). As previously stated, possible males and \n\nfemales were excluded from this comparison. This marked difference in number of \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nindividuals used was a result, as stated in Feingold and Evans (2014a) of the difficulty \n\nin gender determination of male dolphins. The genital area is not often seen and females \n\nare easier to identify when they are seen with their calves.  \n\nIn order to attain better data, gender determination must be improved. As \n\nsuggested by Feingold and Evans (2014a), genetic sampling would contribute to the \n\nincrease in information regarding the population studied.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Summer vs Winter \n\nThe greater MCP area for the winter sightings suggest that the population is much \n\nmore dispersed between November 1\nst\n and March 31\n\nst\n. As seen in figure 10, the summer \n\nsightings were mostly concentrated in Cardigan Bay, with a few dolphins spotted \n\naround Anglesey and two sightings in the Liverpool Bay area. The absence of sightings \n\nat the Isle of Man also contributes to the lower MCP area determined.  \n\nMoreover, the overlap between the winter and summer MCPs was much greater \n\nfor the summer locations than the winter (79.3% for summer and 62.1% for winter), \n\nmeaning the area of overlap makes up 79% of the summer area and only 62% of the \n\nwinter area.  \n\n \n\nConcerning the home range estimations, as seen in figure 1.3 (Appendix I), the \n\nsummer mean home range is located mostly in both SACs and in north Anglesey.  The \n\ncore area is located in the coastal area of Cardigan Bay SAC. On the contrary, the \n\nwinter home range is more disperse, with a lower presence in the Cardigan bay area and \n\ngreater dolphin concentrations around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle of \n\nMan. The winter core areas were mostly at the northern coast of Anglesey and, on a \n\nlower level, at the Cardigan Bay SAC. The presence of bottlenose dolphins in these \n\nareas is in line with previous works. Feingold and Evans (2014a) and Lohrengel and \n\nEvans (2015) have mentioned the presence of individuals from the CB area at the \n\npreviously mentioned areas during the winter time, as shown in this study, as well as \n\nduring the summer. The data used for this study, however did not contain summer \n\nsightings at such locations. This may be due to the fact that only dolphins sighted both \n\nduring the winter and the summer were selected or due to the low coverage of the \n\nnorthern areas.  \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nThe mean home range is greater for the summer sightings, as there are more \n\nindividuals that occupy the whole bay, in opposition to the winter home ranges, where \n\nthe animals are mostly concentrated around the northern coast of Anglesey and a few \n\nanimals are scattered between the two Special Areas of Conservation and the Isle of \n\nMan. The greater concentration of dolphins around Anglesey, however, leads to a \n\nslightly greater core area, as the summer core area is only found at the coastal area of \n\nthe Cardigan Bay SAC. The overlap in core areas was extremely low but similar for \n\nboth groups, meaning the majority of the animals spend the year in completely different \n\nlocations: winter in the north and summer in the south.  \n\n \n\nDespite demonstrating a clear difference between summer and winter sightings, \n\nadditional data is necessary, especially in the winter time and at the northern areas \n\noutside Cardigan Bay, as surveys were mostly conducted in the summer and at the CB \n\nSAC area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Well marked vs Non-marked \n\nAs the percentage overlap for the non-marked MCP corresponds to the entirety of \n\nthe area we can determine that there is no difference in distribution of non-marked and \n\nwell marked animals, as both well-marked and non-marked animals were sighted in the \n\nexact same places where the areas overlap. However, as the overlap only corresponds to \n\nless than half of the well marked MCP area (46,8%),  these dolphins can be found \n\nacross a much greater area.  \n\n \n\nThe home range and core area are in line with the MCPs obtained, with slight \n\ninsignificant variations, with similar percentage overlaps and similar areas for both, \n\nonly smaller for the non-marked animals.  \n\nThe fact that well-marked animals have a greater estimated area does not mean \n\nthey are greater in numbers or expand in greater areas. Well-marked dolphins are much \n\neasier to identify and most photographs taken will lead to a correct identification, even \n\nif the photograph does not have excellent quality, whereas a non-marked dorsal fin is \n\nmuch harder to use as an identifiable feature. Using non-marked unidentifiable dorsal \n\nfins is even discouraged for population size estimations (W\u00fcrsig and Jefferson, 1990).  \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nAll non-marked dolphins used in this study were positively identified, through \n\nother distinct features, such as dorsal fin shape, distinctive markings in their body or \n\neven particular pigmentations patterns unique to the individuals. \n\nThe lower number of non-marked animals with lower home ranges derives from \n\nthe low level of certainty from the identification of these dolphins. At the SWF, a \n\ngreater number of marked individuals were positively identified than un-marked \n\nindividuals during a portion of the years used at this study (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). \n\n \n\nThough there has been an improvement in technology in relation to photographic \n\nequipment, in order to obtain better identification features for non-marked dolphins, \n\ngreater improvements must be attained in order to get better quality photographs. Other \n\nequipment, as drone footage and better quality underwater video cameras, would be \n\nuseful for spotting more defining features in the body of unmarked individuals. \n\n  \n\n \n\n4.4. Females with calves vs Females without calves \n\nAs seen previously, the MCP percentage overlap for females with calves was \n\napproximately 99.5% whereas the females without calves overlap was 56.8%. As \n\nrepresented in figures 14 and 15, the females with calves were sighted in locations much \n\ncloser to shore and more concentrated at the two Cardigan Bay SACs, with a few \n\nfemales being spotted at the northern coast of Anglesey, whereas during the years \n\nwithout a calf, females were also seen at Liverpool Bay and the Isle of Man. \n\n \n\nWhen observing the home range and core area estimations, the females with \n\ncalves had an almost total overlap while the overlap for females without calves was \n\naround 50% for both 95% and 50% KDE, which indicates that the females with calves \n\ndo not seek different areas than the ones occupied by other females dolphins without \n\ncalves. Instead, females without calves tend to spread further away offshore, occupying \n\nthe whole bay area, while females with calves tend to stay closer to shore at more \n\nsheltered locations. These locations may be more attractive to mothers, providing the \n\nopportunity to forage more quickly, leaving the calves alone for less time as well as \n\nallowing the calves to start learning how to catch prey (Feingold and Evans, 2014a). \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nThe northern areas (Liverpool Bay and Isle of Man) were not represented, as the \n\nnumber of encounters was not sufficient for establishing this area as important for these \n\nanimals. \n\nThe females with calves had a much smaller home range and core areas than the \n\nfemales without calves, which corresponds to the results obtained by Baylis (2013) that \n\nhas stated that females with greater reproductive success tend to have smaller home \n\nranges and core areas.  \n\nThe Cardigan Bay area is an important nursery area for the bottlenose dolphins \n\n(Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). The presence of mothers and calves at the Pen Ll?n a\u2019r \n\nSarnau SAC suggests this area is also used as a nursery in opposition to being \n\nexclusively used for socialization and mating, which further strengthens the hypothesis \n\nmentioned at Feingold and Evans (2014a).  \n\n \n\nFurther studies must be conducted at the northern coast of Anglesey, as several \n\nfemales with calves encounters have occurred at this location. Possible conservation \n\nmeasures may be applied in order to protect the areas if they are in fact important for \n\nthis species. Also, surveys must be also done at the northern locations (Liverpool Bay \n\nand Isle of Man), in order to determine of this is in fact an area with a regular presence \n\nof individuals from this population. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5. Water depth \n\nMost groups had similar depth ranges with similar standard deviations. The only \n\nnoticeable difference was the winter depth, of -26.6m. The variation was not significant, \n\nhowever, as the standard deviation value was also greater for this group (Table 6). \n\nThe greater depth is in line with the fact that most dolphins are located outside the \n\nCardigan Bay Area during the winter time. As some areas surrounding Anglesey are \n\nslightly deeper than the CB area, the depth would be slightly higher than at the summer \n\nhome range locations.  \n\n \n\nStudies conducted on other resident populations show a variable array of depths \n\nfor this species. The resident population of bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay \n\n(Florida) prefer sites with a depth lower than 3 meters whereas the populations of the \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nMoray Firth (Scotland) and Shannon estuary (Ireland) prefer deep waters with steep \n\nslopes (Wilson et al., 1997; Ingram and Rogan, 2002). \n\nIngram and Rogan (2002) have determined that the depth preferred by the \n\nShannon Estuary resident bottlenose dolphin population was of 30m to 50m, slightly \n\ngreater than the depths determined in this study. However, this preference was \n\ncorrelated to the greater prey availability. Further studies must be conducted in order to \n\ndetermine if prey availability in the Cardigan Bay area corresponds to the depths \n\nattained in this study or if there are other factors that contribute for the lower depth \n\npreference.    \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6. Data gathering \n\nThe processing of acquiring data is extremely complex in cetacean research as, \n\nunlike terrestrial animals, cetaceans are hidden beneath the surface most of the time, \n\nonly becoming visible for a few moments each time. Consequently, some errors and \n\nrestrictions are bound to occur.  \n\nFirstly, boat traffic has been known to have an impact on behaviour and \n\ndistribution of bottlenose dolphins, especially with a great number of vessels (Feingold \n\nand Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). When aboard the whale watching \n\nvessels, this influence is greater, namely at the New Quay bay, where boat density is \n\nhigh mainly in the summer months. This disturbance, though in a smaller scale, also \n\nextends to the presence of the research vessels. It is, however, not possible to study \n\nthese animals without some degree of disturbance. Nevertheless, researchers always \n\nseek to keep the impact to a minimum.  \n\nSome errors in the dataset were deleted, such as a dolphin encounter near \n\nBirmingham (central England). The volunteer's lack of experience may lead to errors \n\ncommitted during data collection or at the data treatment. The most detectable errors \n\ncan be excluded, yet other less perceptible errors are often included in research data. On \n\nthe other hand, these errors are rare and volunteers gain experience doing consecutive \n\nsurveys. \n\nAdditionally, sampling during the years analysed was not even for all locations, as \n\ncoverage of the Cardigan Bay SAC was higher than for all other locations, since surveys \n\noutside this Special Area of Conservation only started in 2011 (Feingold and Evans, \n\n2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  The offshore area was also under-surveyed when \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nin comparison with the coastal area sampled. Time and money constraints as well as the \n\npoor weather conditions typical of this area contributed to the lower offshore coverage \n\n(Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  \n\nUsing opportunistic platforms, namely the land-watches and the whale watching \n\ntrips, the effort was most frequently concentrated in the New Quay bay and the coastal \n\narea of the Cardigan Bay SAC. However, these data gathering methods were the most \n\nfrequently employed as they are a highly cost effective way to record dolphin sightings. \n\nOne consequence of using these means frequently to acquire data is the overestimation \n\nof the core areas in almost all groups. In order to more accurately assess unbiased core \n\nareas, it is necessary to conduct more surveys at the other areas and less at the New \n\nQuay bay and the near shore area of the Cardigan Bay SAC. \n\n \n\nWith the population's decrease in numbers in Cardigan Bay and the apparent shift \n\nin the individual's locations (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015), it is imperative to increase \n\nsurvey coverage in other areas of Cardigan Bay as well as the other areas where \n\nencounters occurred (north Anglesey, Liverpool Bay, Isle of Man).  \n\nPrey availability also seems to be decreasing (Feingold and Evans, 2014a) and, as \n\na result, measures that prevent overfishing should be implemented. Vessel speed and \n\ndriver's behaviour should also be monitored by the authorities, in order to insure a lower \n\nlevel of disturbance towards the animals, as sometimes excesses may be committed, \n\noften out of ignorance for the established rules. \n\n  \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n5. CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nThe present study aimed to determine the home range of the bottlenose dolphins \n\npopulation of Cardigan Bay, in Wales. By comparing different groups, according to \n\ncertain characteristics (gender, time of sighting, degree of dorsal fin markings and \n\npresence of offspring), it is possible to assess the areas that are more import to each \n\ngroup or to the entire population and ascertain which measures can be applied in order \n\nto decrease the impact exerted in these animals. \n\n \n\nMCP (Minimum Convex Polygon), the total area where the animals were sighted \n\nand KDE (Kernel Density Estimators), the locations the animals use more, were \n\ndetermined for each group and the pairs were compared. \n\nRegarding the comparison between females and males, the total area, mean home \n\nrange and core area were slightly higher for males. The overlap areas were also similar. \n\nAs a result there were no significant differences in spatial distribution in both sexes. The \n\ngreater limitation was the greater number of females relatively to the number of males \n\nstudied. Gender determination is hard to achieve for males when the genital area is not \n\nvisible during the observation.  The presence of calves near an individual several times  \n\nensures an easier identification of female dolphins, but there is no such way to \n\ndetermine when a dolphin is male. \n\nWhen comparing sightings between April 1st to October 31s (summer) and \n\nNovember 1\nst\n to March 31\n\nst\n (winter), the locations obtained were quite different. The \n\nsummer mean home range is located mostly in both SACs and in north Anglesey.  The \n\ncore area is located in the coastal area of Cardigan Bay SAC. On the contrary, the \n\nwinter home range is more disperse, with a lower presence in the Cardigan bay area and \n\ngreater dolphin concentrations around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle of \n\nMan. The winter core areas were located mostly at the northern coast of Anglesey and, \n\non a lower level, at the Cardigan Bay SAC. The lack of constant survey coverage of the \n\nlocations outside the Cardigan Bay area and, to an extent, outside the Cardigan Bay \n\nSAC limit the number of sightings used for this study. More surveys would probably \n\nlead to a much more reliable conclusion regarding these two groups.  \n\nAnimals with well marked dorsal fins were contrasted with dolphins without a \n\nmarked dorsal fin. The areas overlapped, with further areas occupied by well marked \n\nindividuals. However, this does not mean they are greater in numbers or expand in \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\ngreater areas. Well-marked animals are much easier to identify, whereas a non-marked \n\ndorsal fin is much harder to use as an identifiable feature. The areas estimated were the \n\nsame but the well marked dolphins had a greater area since these animals are more \n\neasily identifiable. \n\nConcerning the females with calves vs females without calves, the females with \n\ncalves do not seek different areas than the ones occupied by other females dolphins \n\nwithout calves. Instead, females without calves tend to spread further away offshore, \n\noccupying the whole bay area, while females with calves tend to stay closer to shore at \n\nmore sheltered locations. This comparison was limited by the sometimes low number of \n\nsightings of mothers and calves as, in some years, encounters were not enough to \n\ndetermine of the female had a calve or not.  \n\nWhen determining the mean depth for each group, most groups had similar depth \n\nranges with similar standard deviations. The only noticeable difference was the winter \n\ndepth, however the variation was not significant. The greater depth is in line with the \n\nfact that most dolphins are located outside the Cardigan Bay Area during the winter \n\ntime. As some areas surrounding Anglesey are slightly deeper than the CB area, the \n\ndepth would be slightly higher than at the summer home range locations.  \n\nThe core areas were mostly located at the coastal area of the Cardigan Bay SAC, \n\nas both land-based surveys and whale watching trips were conducted exclusively at this \n\nlocation. The effort regarding all the surveys conducted throughout the years was, as a \n\nresult, much more concentrated around this area than all the remaining locations. In \n\naddition, due to several constraints, surveys were mostly conducted both during the \n\nsummer time as well as inshore.  \n\nDespite all the limitations, conclusions were drawn regarding the population \n\nstudied.  \n\n \n\nRegarding the similarity between females and males' home range, these results are \n\nsimilar to a previous masters thesis study on the relationship between reproductive \n\nsuccess and home range (Baylis, 2013), conducted in the Cardigan Bay dolphins.  \n\nThe presence of individuals around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle \n\nof Man is in line with previous works. Feingold and Evans (2014a) and Lohrengel and \n\nEvans (2015) have mentioned the presence of the Cardigan Bay dolphins in these areas \n\nas well as the conclusion that most animals spend the winter in the north and summer in \n\nthe south.  \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nThe home range estimation regarding the presence of females and calves at the \n\nPen Llyn a\u2019r Sarnau  SAC is in line with a hypothesis from a previous work (Feingold \n\nand Evans, 2014a) that stated that this Special Area of Conservation was not only used \n\nfor socialization and mating, but also as a nursery.  \n\nThe results obtained in this comparison correspond to the results found by Baylis \n\n(2013) that has stated that females with greater reproductive success tend to have \n\nsmaller home ranges and core areas.  \n\nThe average depths determined were in opposition with results found in Sarasota \n\nBay (Florida), where preferred depths were lower than 3 meters, however were closer to \n\nthe average 30-50meters found at the Shannon Estuary (Ireland) (Ingram and Rogan, \n\n2002). \n\n \n\nAs suggested by Feingold and Evans (2014a), genetic sampling would contribute \n\nto the increase in information regarding the population studied, mainly for gender \n\ndetermination. The use of underwater cameras would also be an important tool to both \n\ndetermine gender and, when close enough, determine other ways to identify an \n\nindividual, particularly when the dorsal fin does not present visible marks or nicks. \n\nIn addition, further surveys outside the Cardigan Bay SAC are required, mainly \n\naround Anglesey, as this location seems an important place for dolphin population. If \n\nthis is the case, further protection measures are required for this region and possibly \n\nestablishing a Special Area of Conservation, particularly for the north coast of this \n\nisland. Other areas would also require further coverage, as Liverpool Bay, the Isle of \n\nMan and the Pen Llyn SAC, both during the winter and summer and specially the \n\noffshore areas of the two SACs. Furthermore, since dolphins were encountered outside \n\nboth Special Areas of Conservation, other transects outside these areas could prove \n\nbeneficial to estimating the real range of these individuals. \n\nFurthermore, further studies must be conducted on prey availability in the \n\nCardigan Bay area, since prey seems to be decreasing (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).    \n\nThis study is intended to be continued so other discoveries regarding this \n\npopulation can lead to its increase in numbers and habitat quality improvement. \n\n  \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n6.
