Detecting these kind of practices has become a priority within antitrust \nagencies around the world. Regulators are constantly after effective ways to punish companies so \nthat the costs of colluding outweighs its benefits. These punishments usually come in the form of \nfines or compensation payments that are calculated based on the estimated damages caused by \nthe colluding firm. However, detecting cartel can pose a challenge to economists; it is a data \nintensive and time consuming process that involves estimating a competitive benchmark to \ncompare with the suspected collusive behavior.   \n\nThe aim of this paper is to review the methods available for cartel damage quantification and \napply it on a practical case. We start this study by understanding the harm that collusive practices \nused by cartels cause to economy and society. We then explore the different types of empirical \nmethodologies used in calculating the estimated damages and the trade-offs of employing them. \nNext, we compare how antitrust agencies operate in the United States, European Union and \nBrazil and discuss their roles in calculating the damages and setting an appropriate fine to an \nantitrust violating firm. Finally, we take make an in depth analysis of a cartel in the Liquefied \nPetroleum Gas distribution market from February 2003 to April 2005 in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil, \nemploying the multivariate before and after and the difference-in-difference approaches. We \nfound that the price overcharge for the cartel was between 10% to 13% in the first methodology \nand 16% to 17% in the latter.      \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nAs pr\u00e1ticas colusivas utilizadas pelos cart\u00e9is revelaram-se extremamente prejudiciais \u00e0 efici\u00eancia \necon\u00f4mica e ao bem-estar social. A detec\u00e7\u00e3o desse tipo de pr\u00e1tica tornou-se uma prioridade das \nag\u00eancias antitruste em todo o mundo. Os reguladores est\u00e3o constantemente em busca de \nmaneiras eficazes de punir as empresas, para que os custos do conluio superem seus benef\u00edcios. \nEssas puni\u00e7\u00f5es geralmente v\u00eam na forma de multas ou pagamentos de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o que s\u00e3o \ncalculados com base nos danos estimados causados pela empresa em conluio. Por\u00e9m, a detec\u00e7\u00e3o \nde um cartel pode representar um desafio para economistas pois \u00e9 um processo demorado que \ninvolve a estima\u00e7\u00e3o de um mercado contrafatual para ser comparado com o mercado onde se \nsuspeita um comportamento colusivo.  \n\nO objetivo deste artigo \u00e9 revisar os m\u00e9todos dispon\u00edveis para a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de danos de cartel e \naplic\u00e1-lo a um caso pr\u00e1tico.

Exploramos, ent\u00e3o, os diferentes tipos de metodologias \nemp\u00edricas utilizadas para calcular os preju\u00edzos estimados e as vantagens e desvantagens de cada. \nEm seguida, comparamos a atua\u00e7\u00e3o das ag\u00eancias antitruste nos Estados Unidos, na Uni\u00e3o \nEurop\u00e9ia e no Brasil e, sobretudo, a forma em que calculam os danos e estabelecem uma multa \napropriada para uma empresa que viola a legisla\u00e7\u00e3o antitruste. Finalmente, realizamos uma \nestudo de caso de um cartel no mercado de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e1s liquefeito de petr\u00f3leo que ocorreu \nentre fevereiro 2003 a abril de 2005 no Par\u00e1, Brasil, empregando as v\u00e1rias metodologias \nestudadas acima e abordando as metodologias do before and after econom\u00e9trico e o diferen\u00e7a em \ndiferen\u00e7a.

The act of two or more competing firms to coordinate decisions allows them \n\nto earn higher profits than they would have in a competitive environment. By forming a cartel, \n\nfirms aim at maximizing their joint profits. In such cases, the colluding firms may exercise \n\nmarket power by increasing price above marginal costs and consequently decreasing supply \n\nbelow the competitive equilibrium1. Not only does this decreases total welfare generated by the \n\nmarket, but it also allows cartel firms to appropriate most of the consumer surplus. \n\nDetecting these kind of practices has become a priority within antitrust agencies around the \n\nworld. Most countries have created laws that prohibit firms from coordinating with their \n\ncompetitors in order to decrease competition. However, detecting collusion is not so \n\nstraightforward as one might think. According to Harrington (2004), there are two general ways \n\nof detecting a cartel: observing the means by which firms coordinate and observing its end \n\nresult2. It is a very data-intensive and time consuming process since it involves estimating a \n\ncompetitive benchmark and comparing it to the behavior of the suspected infringers.  \n\n In addition, since colluding is highly lucrative when successful, it is attractive for firms to \n\nengage in the practice when they see an opportunity. In a study performed by Ivaldi et al. (2016), \n\non average, competition authorities do not recuperate excess profits gained by cartel members, \n\neven in developed countries.3 Therefore, regulators try to find effective ways to punish \n\ncompanies so that the costs of colluding outweighs its benefits. These punishments usually come \n\nin the form of fines or compensation payments that are calculated based on the estimated \n\ndamages caused by the colluding firm. However, imposing a penalty that is too high can have a \n\ncontrary effect, undermining the firm's ability to be an efficient market player, hindering the \n\n                                                 \n1 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis.

Switzerland:  Springer, 2016. pp. 103-133 \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nmain objective of bringing the economy back to fair competition.4 Therefore, antitrust agencies \n\nmust balance these two objectives.   \n\nA lot of controversy has surfaced concerning the role of the antitrust agency in calculating the \n\nestimated damages. Some experts argue that the sole role for an antitrust agency is to implement \n\na fine to punish the infringers. Others argue that in order to set an appropriate fine, regulators \n\nmust be able to calculate the estimated damage cause by the collusion. \n\nCalculating damages caused by a cartel is an important step in the direction of establishing an \n\nappropriate level of compensation to award the plaintiff or estimating the illegal profits obtained \n\nby the cartelized industry so to impose a fine. The nature of damages calculation will depend on \n\nthe legal framework in place; each country have different provisions as regarding to who can \n\nbring a claim and to what kind of damages may be vindicated5. It will also depend on the type of \n\ndata that is available and the time and human resource constraints in each case. When selecting a \n\nsuitable approach to calculate estimated damages, analysts will have to aim for a method that can \n\nlead to accurate results without hindering practicality and at the same time taking into \n\nconsideration the legal constraints, such as information asymmetry and burden of proof.      \n\nThe objective of this paper is to review the methods available for cartel damage quantification. \n\nThe text is organized in the following way: In Chapter 1 we carry out a microeconomic analysis \n\nof the effects of cartels on the economy and social welfare. Chapter 2 discusses the trade-offs of \n\nemploying the different evaluation methods and takes a detailed look into the most commonly \n\nemployed empirical methods in cartel cases worldwide - namely: (i) Before and After Time \n\nSeries Methodology; (ii) Multivariate Before and After Approach; (iii) Yardstick Approach and \n\nthe Difference-in-Difference Method; (iv) Cost-plus Approach; and (v) Structural models and \n\nMarket Simulation. Following in Chapter 3, this paper will compare the strengths and \n\nweaknesses of each empirical method and how they are employed in different legislations: \n\nUnited States, European Union and Brazil. Finally, Chapter 4 will analyze a cartel case tried by \n\nthe Brazilian antitrust agency, Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ\u00f4mica - \"CADE\", in the \n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (\"LPG\") distribution market in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil.   \n\n                                                 \n4 Ivaldi, M. et al, \"Cartel Damages to the Economy: An Assessment for Developing Countries,\" Competition Law \nEnforcement in the BRICS and in Developing Countries.

On Figure 1 we have price represented by the vertical y-axis \n\nand quantity by the horizontal x-axis. The negative relationship between price and quantities is \n\nrepresented by the downward-sloping demand curve. This demand curve shows that buyers will \n\npurchase greater quantities at lower prices. The graph shows the observed prices and quantities \n\nimplemented by the cartel, p1 and Q1, and the estimated counterfactual prices and quantities, p0 \n\nand Q0 that would have been observed had there not been a cartel. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Cartel Damage \n\n \n\n \n\nThe areas of rectangles A and B represent the total estimated damage incurred by consumers. \n\nRectangle A represents the transfer of consumer surplus to the producer additional profits and B \n\nthe deadweight loss from goods that would have been sold at p0 but are no longer sold at p1. \n\nEquation 1 illustrates a rent transfer from the consumer to the producer: \n\nSource: Davis and Garc\u00e9s (2010) \n\nc\t\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n\t \t \t      ( 1 ) \n\nThe term (p1 - p0) in equation 1 is denoted as the \"price overcharge;\" consumers will pay p1 \n\ninstead of p0 and purchase quantity Q1 instead of Q0. In other words, consumers are charged a \n\nhigher price than they would have been under competition and have a lower quantity available in \n\nthe market6. By adding the two areas, you get the total damage to consumer from the cartel. \n\nTriangle C, on the other hand, represents the deadweight loss to the producer, or what it could \n\nhave sold at p0 but didn't at p1.    \n\nDeadweight loss is inefficient because it restricts the output available in the economy and pushes \n\nout of the market potential consumers, who would be willing to purchase the good at the price \n\ninterval [p0, p1]. The producer also suffers with the deadweight loss, however, since the transfer \n\nin consumer surplus to the producer (area A) is always larger than the deadweight loss to the \n\nsupplier (area C), the cartel is still worthwhile for them. While the deadweight loss is considered \n\na problem by antitrust authorities, it is rarely included in the damage calculations due to the \n\ndifficulty of accurately measuring it. In order to calculate the total amount of deadweight loss, \n\none has to estimate five elements caused by the infringement: (i) the market output with the \n\nviolation; (ii) the amount of the overcharge; (iii) what the market output would have been in a \n\nviolation-free world; (iv) the price that would have been charged had there not been the \n\nviolation; (v) the shape of the demand curve between (i) and (iii)7. In particular, items (iv) and \n\n(v) pose a seriously challenge, since they require the analyst to estimate the elasticity of demand.   \n\nSome scholars argue that trebling actual damages may serve as a surrogate measure to actually \n\ncalculating the deadweight loss8. Others argue that if antitrust violators are not held accountable \n\nfor the deadweight loss their actions inflict on consumers and the market, the damages owed \n\n                                                 \n6 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380 \n7 Leslie, C.R., \"Antitrust damages and deadweight loss,\" The Antitrust Bulletin, 51(3), pp. 521-567, 2006. \n8 The employment of trebling in place of actually calculating the damages caused by the deadweight loss is still a \nvery controversial issue among scholars. While some argue that trebling damages can mitigate the effect of DWL, \nothers argue that it does not, since it still excludes consumers that were forced out of the market. In addition, they \nargue that since many collusion cases are settled, trebling doesn't even take place so it does not provide full \ncompensation for the higher prices consumers who continued to buy the product had to pay (Leslie 2006) \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nwould be an insufficient deterrent9. For the purposes of this study, we will exclude the \n\ndeadweight loss from the damages calculation.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Cartel formation in intermediary markets \n \n\nNow, we extend the previous analysis to the context of a production chain, where the cartel is \n\nestablished in an intermediary market. If we consider the cartelized product as an intermediate \n\nproduction good, used as an input factor by a downstream firm in the production of a final good, \n\nthe direct cartel effect will be reflected by an increase of the direct purchasers\u2019 variable costs10. \n\nAssume that a firm in a competitive market sells its good to a downstream firm at a wholesale \n\nprice wcomp. The retailer (the downstream firm) sells its good to its end consumer at a retail price \n\nrcomp. Assuming for simplicity that the retailer has no cost other than its input cost wcomp the \n\nfirm's profit would be rcomp - wcomp.  \n\nNow, if the upstream firm decides to enter into collusive agreement setting its prices at a higher \n\nlevel than the competitive price as an attempt to raise its profits, that will affect its direct \n\npurchasers profit. In this case, the cost for the downstream firm will rise to wcartel and it will have \n\nto increase its retail price in order to minimize its loss.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9 Leslie, C.R., \"Antitrust damages and deadweight loss,\" The Antitrust Bulletin, 51(3), pp. 521-567, 2006. \n10 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee (2011) \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nFigure 2: Damages with two layers of downstream purchasers \n\n \n\n \n\nThis market dynamics is illustrated in Figure 2. The shaded area A represents the overcharge \n\nearned by the cartel practiced by the upstream firms. Rectangle B shows the fraction of the \n\novercharged that is passed-on from the downstream firm to the final customer. The increase in \n\ncosts of its input will make the retailer increase its price by a fraction of the overcharge so as to \n\nminimize the loss resulting from the collusive prices. It is important to highlight that the shaded \n\narea B, or the pass-on, will almost always be smaller than that of A, since retailers can only \n\ntransfer a portion of the price increase to the final consumer11. The amount that will be passed \n\non, will depend on the demand elasticity of the good; the more inelastic the product's demand \n\ncurve is, the larger the pass-on will be. Rectangle C represents the output effect, or the additional \n\nprofit that the retailer would have made if he could have bought the inputs from the upstream \n\nfirm at the competitive wholesale price (wcomp). Lastly, the shaded area D represents the output \n\neffect for the end-consumer. It represents the additional utility that the final consumer would \n\nhave gained at a higher consumption level, had there not been a collusive agreement at the \n\nupstream level. Not only does the price of the final good increase but the quantity of goods \n\n                                                 \n11 Unless the demand is perfectly inelastic, the pass-on will always be smaller than the price overcharge \nimplemented by the cartel.  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nsupplied will decrease, having a serious effect on consumer's utility and total welfare12. The total \n\nharm to the final consumer is represented by the shaded areas B+D.  \n\nAlthough the bulk of the social costs of cartels resides in the aggregate overcharge, the potential \n\neffects of a cartel can be even larger than that. The market power gained by firms engaging in \n\ncartel activity can lead to indirect effects (also known as umbrella effects13), where non-\n\nconspiring firms are enabled to charge higher prices. Not only does it affect direct and final \n\nconsumers, it may also affect the cartel's upstream supplier. A cartel may enforce lower input \n\nprices from its upstream supplier, either by reducing its overall demand or simply by negotiating \n\nprice as a single entity. The upstream suppliers can pass on these worsened sale conditions to its \n\nupstream supplier and so on. It also may have an exclusionary effect on a potential competitor \n\noutside the cartel and their potential consumers.   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee (2011) \n13 The umbrella effect is a strongly debated issue regarding the estimation of damages. The question of whether the \ncartel participant should be liable to pay damages to a direct buyer of an output from a non-participating seller under \nthe argument that this seller increased price under the protection of a \"price umbrella\" created by the cartel raises \nmany unanswered questions. (Clark 2004)  \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nFigure 1: Downstream and upstream cartel direct and indirect effects14 \n\n \n\nSource: European Commission: OECD Competition Committee (2011) \n\n \n\nWe summarize the potential effects of a cartel into three main parts, as illustrated by Verboven \n\nand Van Dijk (2009)15. First, there is the price overcharge or price effect. The price overcharge \n\ncan be translated into the decline in downstream profits due to higher costs from buying input at \n\na higher price from the cartel. If the cartelized product is an intermediate good considered as an \n\ninput factor to an end product, it will also have an effect on the final consumer. Which leads us \n\nto the second effect, the pass-on effect. This happens when downstream firms increase their price \n\nin order to pass-on to the final consumer some of their cost due to the increase in the cartel price. \n\nThis decreases the damage caused to the downstream firm but leads to an indirect effect on the \n\nfinal consumer. It is important to highlight that in many jurisdictions, namely the US, the pass-on \n\ndefense is not allowed in courts. In such cases, cartel members are held accountable for the entire \n                                                 \n14 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011 \n15 Verboven, F. and  Dijk, van T., \"Cartel Damages Claims and the Passing on Defense.\" SSRN Eletronic Journal, \n2009. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\ndamage caused by the overprice, even if it was not entirely incurred by the downstream firm. \n\nFinally, there is the output effect: a price increase in a product from a cartelized industry will \n\nusually have a negative effect on the quantity produced. Therefore, the output effect considers \n\nthe lost margins on units no longer sold due to the decrease in supply under a cartel. \n\nAs we have seen before, in most cases, the customer of the cartel may be a downstream firm that \n\nmay transfer some or all of the increase in the price of their inputs to the final customer. This is \n\ncalled the pass-on effect. In a potential damage claim, the defendant might use this as a defense \n\nto decrease the magnitude of the damages owed to the plaintiffs. To measure the pass-on effect \n\ninvestigators have to be able to measure the price increase of the good that was sold from the \n\ndownstream firm to the final consumer. From the point of view of the downstream firm, the price \n\nincrease of the input bought from the cartel is equivalent to an increase in their marginal cost. \n\nOften, the downstream firm is only able to pass on a portion of the price increase (shaded area B \n\nin Figure 2). However, the more market power the downstream firm possesses the larger the \n\npass-on will be16. As a general rule, the pass-on defense is not allowed in US antitrust cases. In \n\nEurope, however, it is more common to see the pass-on defense being used in courts.  \n\n Still, determining which concepts should be incorporated in the process of calculating the \n\ndamages is essential. The first and foremost step requires that the antitrust authority defines the \n\nconcept of \"damages\". The anticompetitive price overcharge has frequently been key for \n\ncomputing damages claims, but simply using overcharge to quantify damage might seriously \n\nunderestimate the true damage caused by a cartel. Looking solely at the overcharge to the direct \n\ncustomer of the cartel does not take into consideration the deadweight loss and ignores the loss \n\nof total welfare. The calculation could also become more complex if one considers the potential \n\ndynamic effects. These effects might increase damages if a competitive environment could have \n\ncontributed positively to technological advances. On the other hand, it could mitigate damages if \n\nthe higher profits earned by the cartelized firms contributed to higher investments in R&amp;D17.  \n\n                                                 \n16 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380. \n17 A studied performed by Andrea G\u00fcnster, Mathijs van Dijk and Martin Carree concluded that in general cartels \nhinder innovation by decreasing investments in R&amp;D because there is lower incentives to invest in new products and \ntechnologies. However, in some rare cases, higher profits could contribute to R&amp;D investments.  \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nSince these effects are far too complex to be measured, they are usually ignored when calculating \n\ndamages. One might also discuss if the pass-on effect could be used by defendant in attenuating \n\nthe potential damage. Answering these questions is imperative in order to define the theoretical \n\nframework in which the damage calculation will take place. In this study, we will not incorporate \n\nthe pass-on in the damages calculation.   \n\n \n\nChapter 3 - Empirical Methods in Cartel Damage Evaluation \n\n \n\n3.1 Trade-offs Between Empirical Methods: accuracy and practicability \n \n\nWhen deciding on which approach will best be suited to estimate the damages, analyst face \n\ntrade-offs that have to be taken into consideration during the empirical economic analysis. While \n\nsome trade-offs are related to the economic methodology itself, others concern the legal \n\nconstraints, such as the burden of proof, that will define the economic approach. \n\nCartel damage estimation requires the analyst to reconstruct a situation that would have occurred \n\nif there had been no infringement \u2013 the counterfactual - and calculate the price that would have \n\nprevailed had the markets been acting competitively. In order to calculate these counterfactual \n\nprices, analysts have to choose from a variety of available techniques. \n\nThe first and main concern when calculating the counterfactual in cartel cases is to be as accurate \n\nand close to the truth as possible. In order to get there, experts have to balance the trade-off \n\nbetween accuracy and practicality18. Quantifying the effects of a collusive conduct requires the \n\ncreation of a counterfactual scenario, where you try to estimate what the prices would have been \n\nif there had been no cartel. The closer to the real world a model gets the more complex it \n\nbecomes. In statistical terms, accuracy can be defined as being correct on average and precise. \n\nBeing correct on average is not the same as being close to the truth; you could be greatly over or \n\nunderestimating the true value of the damages in one case and still be statistically correct on \n\n                                                 \n18 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\naverage. This is why one also has to consider the precision of the calculation, or how close to the \n\ntruth is the estimate. Note that it is better to have a biased and precise estimate than to have an \n\nunbiased but imprecise one. The more economic assumptions that is employed in the calculation \n\nthe more precise the estimation will be. However, if the assumptions are incorrect, you will \n\nobtain biased results.  \n\nThis leads us to the concept of practicality19. The damage calculation process should be \n\nconducted within a reasonable timeframe and with the available resources. Antitrust authorities \n\nexperience time constraints and have a limited amount of manpower that can be allocated to a \n\nspecific project. Therefore, it is very important that the company makes the necessary \n\ninformation readily available to the authorities or economic analyst. Another key factor that \n\nhelps ensure practicality is proper data submission and presentation style. Economists must \n\nprovide the raw data and any adjustments made to the data and the statistical method used to \n\nderive your results so that a second expert can easily verify the results. This also facilitates the \n\ncomprehension of the methodology and results by judges and lawyers. The expert must be \n\nprepared to explain the logic behind the chosen method, so the more practical the approach the \n\neasier it is to explain. The choice between accuracy and practicality will vary on a case-by-case \n\nbasis and will be highly influenced on the data available. Sometimes, it will not be possible to \n\nobtain an accurate empirical estimate within a reasonable timeframe or with the available \n\nresources. In such cases, it is up to the legal system to determine how to proceed. \n\nFinding a reasonable balance between accuracy and practicality affects how each expert tailors \n\nhis economic analysis. It includes the decision of which data to use and which ones to leave out, \n\nthe number of variables and which method to employ. Working with data submitted by parties \n\ninvolved in the investigation will most likely lead to more accurate estimations. However, \n\nworking with public data not only shortens the data collection period, but also makes you less \n\nsusceptible to data manipulation and allows for cross-firm comparisons20.    \n\nThe number of variables to include in your analysis is also key to achieving unbiased and \n\naccurate results. Although it is important to control for factors that affect price, including all \n\n                                                 \n19 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n20 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\ndemand and cost shifters, not only leads to an intensive data collection process but also may \n\nreduce the accuracy of the estimates. If the variables are highly correlated and the individual \n\nimpact of each variable is not of interest in the analysis, it would be enough to include only the \n\nrepresentative variables and control for the combined effect. On the other hand, omitting an \n\nimportant variable will lead to biased estimates.  \n\nFinally, in many jurisdictions, empirical economic evidence is not sufficient to prove a \n\nmisconduct in cartel cases. Investigators are required to present evidence of explicit \n\ncommunication between infringing firms in order to meet the legal standard of proof21. In Brazil, \n\nalthough rare, it is possible to prosecute and condemn a cartel even when there are no concrete \n\nevidence of exchanges between colluding firms. In some few cases it has been enough to be able \n\nto demonstrate economic indicators of a collusion, however in these cases the burden of proof \n\nwere much higher22. The burden of proof for proving a collusive conduct is also higher when \n\nquantifying damages but that also varies among jurisdictions. Once the antitrust authority has \n\nbeen able to achieve the required standard of proof, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant, \n\nwho will then have to prove that the authority's assertions are wrong. When legal standards are \n\nhigher, experts might be required to present more accurate results, which may lead them to rely \n\non more than one empirical approach. This brings us back to the trade-off of practicality and \n\naccuracy.  \n\nInformation asymmetry is an important element to consider when discussing the burden of proof. \n\nIn cartel cases, the plaintiff does not hold all the information necessary to prove the damage; \n\nusually the defendant is the one who holds the information required to calculate the overcharge \n\nand quantify the damages of the infringement. On the other hand, the plaintiff holds the data on \n\nthe pass-on that could potentially mitigate the damages owed by the defendant23. This creates a \n\ntrade-off on information disclosure among the parties. Tight disclosure rules assures that both \n\nparties have access to the information they need to make their case but it also results in excessive \n\ntransparency. There have been cases where excessive transparency led to tacit collusion and \n\n                                                 \n21 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n22 CADE: Administrative Process no. 08012.001273/2010-24 \n23 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nhigher prices post-intervention, which although not illegal also leads to anticompetitive effects. \n\nTherefore, it lies within the courts and judges to offer guidance in such matters and it will vary \n\ncase-by-case.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Empirical Approaches for Calculating Damages \n \n\nTo understand the robustness of any economic model one has to take into account three \n\nimportant issues: i) the data used; ii) the assumptions made by the investigator; and iii) \n\ninferences that can be drawn from the outputs. A model is only as good as the data input used to \n\npopulate it and the theory used to provide the assumptions24.   \n\n \n\n3.2.1 \"Before and After\" Time Series Methodology \n\nA possible simplistic approach in quantifying price overcharge is to compute the difference \n\nbetween the cartel price and the perfect competitive price. Under perfect competition, assuming \n\nno fixed costs, price will be equal to marginal cost. For illustration purposes, we assume a linear \n\ninverse demand function, pt = at - bQt. In order to maximize profits, the cartel acts as a \n\nmonopolist and chooses joint production quantity such that marginal revenue equals marginal \n\ncost25.  \n\n\t  \n\n2  \n\n                        ( 1 ) \n\nBy substituting the cartel output choice into the demand function and assuming a > c: \n\n2 \t                  ( 2 ) \n\n                                                 \n24 Komninos, A., et al, \"Quantifying Antitrust Damages Towards Non-Binding Guidance Courts.\" Oxera. 2009. \n25 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380.   \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nIn a perfect competition world, pt = ct\n26, therefore the overprice per unit will be the difference \n\nbetween the average price in the cartel period and the average price in free competition: \n\nOverprice per unit = pCartel - pComp     ( 3 ) \n\nMultiply equation ( 3 ) by the total quantity sold in the cartel  period to get the total overcharge. \n\nThe Before and After method is a time series based approach that can be understood as the \n\nempirical counterpart of the analytical discussion above. It basically compares average prices \n\nbetween specific periods. First, the analyst will collect the historical prices practiced by the \n\ncompanies participating in the cartel, both before and after the cartel began and then compare it \n\nto the prices practiced during the time the cartel was in place.  \n\nThe straight-line method assumes that prices in a competitive environment would have grown or \n\ndecreased at a constant rate. Then, the expert will draw a line from the point before the anti-\n\ncompetitive practice started to the period after the practice ended27. The difference between the \n\nactual cartel price and the counterfactual price will allow for the calculation of the damage: \n\nDamages = (pCartel - pComp)*Qcartel \n\n                                                 \n26 Note that the marginal cost in competitive equilibrium is not a given but can be calculated based on the \ninformation on cost. \n27 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Straight-line approach \n\n \n\n                                        Source: OECD \n\nIn countries where before prices are not available, a more simplistic approach can be applied. \n\nAssuming that prices are constant you can set price during infringement period equal to price \n\nafter the conduct. \n\nThe Before and After method assumes that the benchmark period represents a reasonable price \n\nestimate for the counterfactual. It also provides a good estimate when the cartel is stable and the \n\nbasic conditions of supply and demand do not change too much. However, the longer a cartel has \n\nbeen active, the less reliable this method becomes. In this case, historical prices are not the best \n\nindicative of what prices would have been under a competitive market28. Furthermore, this \n\nmethod disregards price change due to external factors, such as change in demand structure, \n\ncosts, or in the competitive environment. In order to address such shortcomings, more \n\nsophisticated econometric models that allow to control for these factors are required29.  \n\nAnother relevant issue when dealing with the Before and After model is the difficulty of \n\ndetermining the exact date of the beginning and end of the cartel. Many scholars claim to be able \n\n                                                 \n28 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n29 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nto deliver a rough estimate of the period a cartel was active, but when the cartel is defined with \n\nmultiple price wars and constant breakdowns and regrouping, it is impossible to determine a \n\nspecific date of its establishment30. Transforming this approach into a simple regression \n\nframework using dummy variables can mitigate this problem. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Multivariate \"Before and After\" Approach  \n\nThe Multivariate Approach is an advanced extension of the Before and After method. It has the \n\nadvantage of not being limited to perfectly competitive markets for the price benchmark. In fact, \n\nit assumes an oligopolistic behavior of the relevant market. In this approach, the economist will \n\nrun a reduced form regression of the price level on demand and cost factors that affect price but \n\nare not controlled by the cartel31. This allows the specialist to control for various exogenous \n\ninfluences on price, which posed a problem in the previous model. It is important to note that \n\neconometric analysis does not prove causality but it seeks to establish statistically significant \n\nrelationship between the dependent variable and the other explanatory variables.  \n\nUsing the dummy variable model, price is set as a dependent variable.  The investigator then \n\nincludes a dummy variable that will represent the period of cartel activity; Dt = 1 means Active \n\nand Dt = 0 means otherwise. The coefficient of the dummy variable will capture the magnitude \n\nof the unexplained increase in prices during the cartel, giving us the overcharge per period. In \n\nthis model, it is important to use only relevant variables so that you do not reduce the size and \n\nsignificance of the coefficient, giving a result that translates into little or no damages due. One \n\nmust keep in mind that the dummy variable coefficient will only capture the average price \n\nincrease during the entire duration of the cartel, independent of changes in market conditions. \n\nAlso, the dummy variable is not so efficient in capturing the exact period in which the cartel \n\n                                                 \n30 Grossman, Peter, \"Why One Cartel Fails and Another Endures: The Joint Executive Committee  and the Railroad \nExpress,\" How Cartels Endure and How They Fail: Studies of Industrial Collusion, Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar \nPublishing, 2004. p. 111-129 \n31 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nended. Cartels may wind down gradually and not immediately, with prices decreasing slowly as \n\nthe cartel reaches its end32. \n\nOn the downside, this model requires an extensive data base and a large amount of market \n\ninfluence factors have to be taken into account. The analyst must be attentive to correlation \n\namong variables and must have an extensive knowledge of the relevant market and institutions.   \n\n\t \t \t     ( 4 ) \n\n = vector of demand and cost factors that affect price \n\n = dummy variable representing active cartel period \n\n \n\nIf the model results in a positive ?, there is sufficient evidence for the existence of a cartel. \n\nOverall, the before and after models are practical and lead to sufficiently accurate results without \n\nrequiring too much data or human resources. However, differently from the structural model that \n\nwe are going to see further ahead, it ignores the deadweight loss from the calculation so that \n\ndamages would be equal to the estimated overcharge.   \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Yardstick and the Difference-in-Differences Methodology \n\nWhen dealing with a cartel that has not been stable throughout its existence or when supply and \n\ndemand conditions fluctuated in a significant way along the years, a better way to estimate the \n\ncounterfactual price is to use the Yardsticks approach. This method quantifies damages by \n\ncomparing the collusive prices with the ones that were practiced in other competitive, but \n\ncomparable, markets. It can be considered an extension to the Before and After model with the \n\naddition of cross-sectional comparison. First, you get the price of a related product that did not \n\ntake part in the cartel and use it as a benchmark. This method is challenging because the two \n\nproducts must be similar in terms of demand, costs and market structure and should at least be \n\nfrom the same country so that institutional shocks are similar.  \n\n                                                 \n32 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: \nPrinceton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380 \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nThe downside of this method is that you have to control for the variances inherent to different \n\nproducts or geographical market. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the benchmark chosen \n\nis cartel-free or unbiased. If the cartel has effects on related market (umbrella effect) estimators \n\nof price effect may be biased.  \n\nTransforming the yardstick approach into a multivariate regression allows us to control for some \n\nof the factors that may influence price. The basic assumption in this model is that all differences \n\nin price that cannot be explained by exogenous factors are a result of an anticompetitive behavior \n\nand can thus be translated into overcharge.   \n\nYou can also unify the Before and After approach with the Yardstick approach into a single \n\nframework known as the difference-in-difference. The difference-in-difference approach is an \n\neconometric method that uses panel data to run cross-sectional data from different periods and \n\nmarkets, which increase the validity of the results. If you have relevant data on various regions \n\n(some that are affected by the cartel and some that are not), the difference-in-difference method \n\nwill allow you to compare the differences in both markets.  \n\nThe purpose of implementing this approach is to evaluate the impact of a treatment on an \n\noutcome Y across different groups. In this case, we will be dealing with two groups: one that has \n\nreceived treatment, or a shock, denominated T=1, and another that does not receive the \n\ntreatment, T=0, which will be our control group. The analysis will be performed in two periods \n\nwhere t=0 indicates the pre-treatment period, and t=1, indicates the post-treatment period33. Each \n\nindividual or group will have two notations, one pre-treatment and one post-treatment. To \n\nsimplify, let us have ?0\nT and ?1\n\nT as the sample averages of the outcome for the treatment group \n\nbefore and after treatment, respectively, and ?0\nC and ?1\n\nC the sample averages for the control \n\ngroup.  \n\nThe outcome Yi can be modeled as: \n\n?      ( 5 ) \n\nThe coefficients ?, ?, ?, ? are unknown parameters representing: \n\n                                                 \n33 Albouy, David. \"Program Evaluation and the Difference in Difference Estimator,\" Economics 131 Section notes \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n? = constant term  \n\n? = treatment group specific effect \n\n? = time trend common to control and treatment groups \n\n? = true effect of treatment \n\nThe purpose of the model is to arrive at an appropriate estimate for ?, that is , given the data \n\navailable.  \n\nThe difference-in-difference estimator is defined as the difference in average outcome in the \n\ntreatment group before and after treatment minus the difference in average outcome in the \n\ncontrol group before and after treatment.  \n\n\t      ( 6 ) \n\nGiven the unbiased estimator assumption, if we take the expectation of the  estimator we get: \n\n     ( 7 ) \n\n\t  \n\n\t             \n\n                    ( 8 ) \n\nThe estimator in Equation 7 is basically taking the average difference in outcome Yi for the pre \n\nand post-treatment period in the treatment group  and subtracting the average difference for the \n\npre and post-treatment period for the control group.  \n\nAnother way to look at the difference-in-difference estimator is as follows: \n\n Pre Post Post-Pre Difference \n\nTreatment    \n\nControl    \n\nT-C Difference    \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nHowever, like with any other model, the difference-in-difference approach also has its \n\ndownsides. Two assumptions must hold in order to guarantee an unbiased difference-in-\n\ndifference estimators:  i) there must be a common trend between prices from the control group \n\nand the treatment group in the periods before the shock, i.e. treatment and control groups should \n\nbe expected to follow similar factor processes prior to the treatment period; and ii) treatment and \n\ncontrol groups should not, on average, experience differential shocks in the post-treatment \n\nperiod. If any of these assumptions do not hold, then there is no guarantee that the DD estimator \n\nis unbiased. A second caveat is related to the control group formation. Finding a relevant and \n\naccurate benchmark, that has similar characteristics to the market in question without having \n\nbeen affected by a cartel is not an easy task. As we will see ahead, this discussion was brought \n\nby one of CADE's advisors in his vote concerning that LPG cartel in the state of Par\u00e1.    \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Cost-plus Approach \n\nThe Cost-based Approach uses financial information of an industry or company to calculate the \n\ncounterfactual price using a bottom-up analysis. The analyst will take the relevant production \n\ncosts and add a reasonable profit margin that could have emerged in an otherwise competitive \n\nmarket. Typically, the average costs will be calculated based on accounting data or information \n\navailable from management reports.  \n\nHowever, it is a somewhat challenging method to employ. First, calculating an appropriate profit \n\nmargin to add to the average unit cost of production can be quite difficult in practice. Also, since \n\nin most cases the accounting costs do not reflect actual economic costs it becomes extremely \n\ndifficult for investigators to calculate a robust cost estimates. In addition, some may consider this \n\nmethod an oversimplification of the factors that affect price in a cartel-free world - it assumes \n\nthat competitive costs and price-cost margin are constant when the cartel is in place34. It is also a \n\nmethod with high data requirement and is time consuming. However, it could be a good proxy \n\nfor a counterfactual when dealing with companies in markets where there is a constant \n\nrelationship between price and cost.   \n\n                                                 \n34 Clark, E. et al, \"Study on the Conditions of Claims for Damages in Case of Infringement of EC Competition \nRules: Analysis of Economic Models for the Calculation of Damages.\" Ashurt, 2004. \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n3.2.5 Structural Models and Market Simulation  \n\nContrary to the yardstick, a comparator-based model, the structural model relies on a simulated-\n\nbase benchmark to calculate damage. The Simulation method, also known as the \"Oligopoly \n\nModel Method,\" as described by Clark et al (2004), aims at calculating the relevant market data \n\non costs, price, quantities, and profits in a collusion-free world. It uses economic models based \n\non industrial organization theory to predict the effect of the shock on prices and output35. It is \n\nworth highlighting that this approach is the only one discussed in this paper that has the capacity \n\nof measuring the deadweight loss. \n\nThe economic analyst will build an economic equilibrium model to determine prices, quantities, \n\ncosts and marginal costs in a cartelized industry. Once assumptions are specified and the model \n\nis laid out, the prices that would have been under competition can be calculated and compared to \n\nthose practiced during the cartel. This model also assumes an oligopolistic behavior, so it is \n\nimportant to decide whether you are dealing with a Bertrand or Cournot competition. This \n\nmethod requires information on costs, market structure and demand and a profound \n\nunderstanding of the market.  \n\nEven though it has an unique capacity of capturing a parcel of the damage that cannot be \n\nmeasured by the other models, it is a much more complicated and time consuming method. It is \n\nhighly sensitive to the assumptions made about cost and demand parameters and how they affect \n\nprices. Also, since it is a data-intensive method it is sensitive to changes in its settings and \n\nparameter values. Damage quantification based on simulation methods might be closest to real-\n\nworld competitive market outcomes, since they do not rely on cost data provided by defendant \n\nand are very transparent for outsiders. However, not only does it present the largest challenges \n\nfor economists with regard to the high level of market knowledge that is required,36 it also faces \n\ndifficulties in being validated in court as an appropriate damage calculation method. Since it is a \n\nmore complex method that involves strong assumptions on a \"would be\" demand, it tend to be \n\nmore vulnerable towards courts. Judges and other non-experts may face some difficulty in \n\ninterpreting the results and the model specifications, therefore economists have to be very \n\n                                                 \n35 Clark, E. et al, \"Study on the Conditions of Claims for Damages in Case of Infringement of EC Competition \nRules: Analysis of Economic Models for the Calculation of Damages.\" Ashurt, 2004. \n36 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garc\u00e9s, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis.

In general, different methods applied to identical cartel \n\nepisodes did not result in significantly different estimates. \n\nThe most common method used among the studies was the Before and After where the price \n\nduring the cartel period is compared to a counterfactual price. The second most commonly \n\nemployed method, accounting for 20 percent of the estimates, was the statistical modeling, \n\nincluding the multivariate before and after. The Yardstick approach accounted for 10 percent of \n\nthe samples while the Cost Based method accounted for 3 percent.    \n\nConnor and Lande (2008)38 concluded that the Before and After time series method usually \n\nprovided overcharges estimates that were higher than other econometric models applied to the \n\nsame cartel episode. One possible reason for such result is that analysts using the Before and \n\nAfter Method may have failed to adjust for all competitive factors that influence the competitive \n\nbenchmark price. The Cost-based and Yardstick approaches yielded even higher overcharge \n\nestimates. One explanation for these higher estimates is that using cost or profits fail to fully \n\naccount for all competitive industry cost. In the Yardstick approach cases, analysts may have \n\nunderestimated quality differences between the products.   \n\nOn Lucinda and Seixas (2016)39 three different methods were tested to calculate overcharges \n\nestimates for a peroxide cartel in Brazil. Investigators arrived at similar results when applying \n\nthe three distinct methodologies, however, just like in Connor's study, some led to higher \n\n                                                 \n37 Doose, Ana Maria. \"Methods for Calculating Cartel Damages: A Survey.\" Ilmeneau Economics Discussion \nPapers, Vol 18, No. 83, 2013. \n38 Connor, J., and Lande, R., \"Cartel Overcharges and Optimal Cartel Fines.\" Issues in Competition Law and Policy \n2203, Chapter 88, 2008. \n39 Lucinda, C. and Seixas, R., \"Preven\u00e7\u00e3o \u00d3tima de Cart\u00e9is: O Caso dos Per\u00f3xidos no Brasil.\" Departamento de \nEstudos Econ\u00f4micos do CADE, 2016. \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\novercharges estimate than others. The time series model resulted in a decrease in price of \n\nsomething in between 15.5 to 22 percent after the end of the cartel40. The average corresponding \n\ndamage caused by the cartel was R$109.93/ton. \n\nThe second method tested was the Difference-in-Difference. In this case the investigators \n\ncollected evidence on a market that could be used as a counterfactual both in South America and \n\nthe United States. The price reductions for a counterfactual market in the United State was R$ \n\n54.8/ton while the scenario with a South American counterfactual was R$ 75.2/ton. When using \n\nboth markets as counterfactuals the price reduction was R$ 67.5/ton.  \n\nAt last, investigators applied the structural models to estimate the overcharges for the peroxide \n\ncartel. To do so, they had to  construct an equation system that reflected the supply and demand \n\nrelation.  \n\n\t \t \t \t \t      ( 5 ) \n\nwhere, \n\n = quantity of Hydrogen Peroxide sold \n\n = price per ton of Hydrogen Peroxide \n\n = demand driver (production in the cardboard sector) \n\n         ( 6 ) \n\nwhere Wt is the cost of labor and Pt = f(Qt,Wt). \n\nThe structural model resulted in an estimated damage of R$ 68.67/ton.   \n\nThese results allows us to conclude that the time series model resulted in a somewhat higher \n\novercharge than the other models.  \n\nFor practicality purposes, many countries recur to more straightforward methods when \n\ndetermining cartel damage in cases of relatively minor economic importance. A simple method \n\nrelies on results from previous cartel cases. This method takes into account the average \n\n                                                 \n40 The values differ depending on the month established for the end of the carte. Three possible cartel end dates were \ntested.  \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\novercharge observed in past known cartels and apply it to any current case. There is an \n\nincreasing number of data on overcharge estimation available in cartel cases which allows us to \n\nestimate the average overcharges. We can see from Figure 4 that the majority of detected cartels \n\nhave an estimated overcharge between 10% to 20%.41 The empirical evidence of existing \n\novercharge estimations suggests a high variation of overcharges across various cases, \n\nhighlighting the need for case specific estimates. Given the high variation and the lack of \n\nprecision of this method in determining the actual overcharge in any given case, not all \n\njurisdictions admit it as an adequate measure of effective damage. \n\n   \n\nFigure 3: Historical overcharge estimations \n\n \n\n \n\nThe United States Sentencing Guidelines established an overcharge estimate of 10 percent of the \n\ntotal volume of commerce. They then doubled that amount to apply the base fine for infringing \n\nfirms42. Recent studies, however, have concluded that an overcharge estimate of 10 percent is \n\nexcessively low43. Surprisingly, 79 percent of the overcharges were above 10 percent and 60 \n\npercent were above 20 percent. The median cartel overcharge for all types of cartels in the period \n\n                                                 \n41 Connor, J. and Lande, R., \"Cartel Overcharges and Optimal Cartel Fines.\" Issues in Competition Law and Policy \n2203, Chapter 88, 2008. \n42 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, (Nov. 2015) \n43 Connor, J., and Lande, R., \"Cartel Overcharges and Optimal Cartel Fines.\" Issues in Competition Law and Policy \n2203, Chapter 88, 2008. \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nstudied was 25 percent44. This shows that the fines being currently applied on cartels are not \n\nnearly enough to hinder the practice. \n\nIn the following sections, we review the approaches that different antitrust agencies apply to \n\ncartel detection, damage evaluation and punishment.  \n\n  \n\n3.3.1 United States and European Union \n\nIn the United States the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") is not required to quantify the actual \n\ndamages that were caused by the conspiracy in order to prove an antitrust infringement; showing \n\nactual or threatened harm to the competitive process is sufficient. Damage quantification is only \n\nrequired in lawsuits where plaintiffs sue for damage recovery. Since damage claims are almost \n\nalways private, it does not lie within the scope of the antitrust authority to quantify that harm45. \n\nAs a matter of fact, civil plaintiffs often build their case upon the DOJ\u2019s investigations and sue \n\ncompanies and individuals that have already been prosecuted criminally. This allows them to use \n\ncriminal fines as a benchmark for damages calculation.46  \n\nIn order to avoid the complex and time consuming process of estimating the illegal gains \n\nobtained from the conspiracy, the US Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\") set the base fine for \n\ncriminal antitrust violation at 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce as a proxy for \n\npecuniary losses. According to the USSG, \"[for] the purpose of this guideline, the volume \n\nattributable to an individual participant in a conspiracy is the volume of commerce47 done by him \n\n                                                 \n44 This study contained 674 observations of average overcharges and included all types of cartels (price fixing, bid-\nrigging, etc). The investigators focused solely on injuries deriving from the transfer of income or wealth from \npurchasers to cartel. For the purposes of simplicity in the calculation, the study disregarded other potential harms \nsuch as umbrella effect, allocative inefficiency, less innovations, managerial slack, and non-price harms to quality \nand variety, among others (Connor and Lande).  \n45 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: \"Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and \nCompetition Agencies.\" OECD Competition Committee, 2011. \n46 Behre, Kirby et al., \"International cartel investigations in the United States,\" The Investigations Review of the \nAmericas 2017, Aug 2016. Accessed on April 2017 from http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/insight/the-\ninvestigations-review-of-the-americas-2017/1067471/international-cartel-investigations-in-the-united-states \n47 The DOJ tends to assume that the volume of commerce affected should consider 100 percent of the sales of the \ngood or services involved in the conspiracy. This approach is not always precise and may lead to unfairly high fines. \nSometimes, only a fraction of the participant's sales has been affected by the collusive conduct. However, \ndetermining specific ways sales were affected by the violation is not only time consuming and complex, it still does \nnot guarantee fair results. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nor his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation\"48. The base fine level is \n\nderived from the estimate that the average gain from price fixing is 10 percent of the selling \n\nprice. The USSG doubled that estimate to 20 percent in order to account for other harms inflicted \n\non consumers such as the deadweight loss. This broad definition gives room for discussion on \n\nhow to calculate the actual volume of commerce affected by the illegal conduct. After \n\nestablishing the base fine, the court calculates a culpability score, based on the level of the \n\noffense and defendant's criminal history. This score is then used establish the minimum and \n\nmaximum multipliers that will determine fine rage49.   \n\nWhen injury complained by a plaintiff is simply the overcharge, little in required under the US \n\nantitrust law. Litigants will have to estimate the counterfactual price using any defensible method \n\nthey choose. The most commonly used method is the Multivariate \"Before and After\" Approach. \n\nThe Difference-in-Difference approach is also frequently used, especially in cases where a \n\nproduct is simultaneously sold in different locations under both cartel and non-cartel prices. \n\nObtaining the data to run these models does not pose a significant difficulty. Usually, the \n\nplaintiff has the data from their purchases, which makes it easier to calculate the overcharge. \n\nThey can rely on public sources or obtain the necessary documents from the defendant. In \n\naddition, even if there are significant uncertainty about the extent of the damages it does not \n\nstand in the way of recovery. Although actual harm cannot be merely speculated, a reasonable \n\ninference with approximate results should suffice.     \n\nThe passing on defense has not been an issue in court proceedings for at least half a decade. \n\nSince calculating the pass on complicates the litigation, it has been precluded by court. \n\nAccording to the Illinois Brick ruling, final or indirect purchasers could not recover overcharges \n\npassed on to them by the direct purchasers. It followed the Hanover Shoe decision, where courts \n\nmade the cartel liable for the entire damages to the direct purchasers. However, this defense \n\ncould be argued under state law50. In the current legislation, in theory, direct purchasers may \n\nclaim the full price overcharge, whether there was pass-on or not, and the indirect purchasers \n\nmay claim a part of that overcharge (that was passed on to them) duplicating a portion of the \n\n                                                 \n48 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, \u00a73E1.1 (Nov. 2015) \n49 Doose, Ana Maria. \"Methods for Calculating Cartel Damages: A Survey.\" Ilmeneau Economics Discussion \nPapers, Vol 18, No. 83, 2013. \n50 Verboven, F. and  Dijk, van T., \"Cartel Damages Claims and the Passing on Defense.\" The Journal of Industrial \nEconomics, Vol LVII, No 3, 2009. pp. 457-491. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\ndamages due. In regard to the deadweight loss, no damage recovery can be claimed for input \n\npurchases not made. The Courts claimed that measuring the relevant elasticity are far too \n\ncomplex and they were not willing to make the drastic simplifications to the economic models in \n\norder to incorporate them51.  \n\nThe European Union has a similar approach in setting fines for antitrust infringers. The EU \n\nCommission is also not required by law to estimate a precise or approximate quantum of \n\nconsumer harm. Given the difficulty on quantifying harm to consumers and to competition, the \n\nCommission takes into consideration the gravity and the duration of the infringement  and  series \n\nof other proxies to set an approximate fine. The Commission analyzes the value of the sales \n\ngenerated by the company during the period of infringement with the product or service \n\ninvolved. Depending on the gravity of the violation they apply a fine of up to 30  percent of \n\nsales. Cartels are considered to be more grave violations and lie in the upper spectrum of the fine \n\nscale, between 15 to 30 percent52.  \n\nHowever, just like in the United States, consumers that were harmed by the infringement have \n\nthe right to sue for damages recovery. The methods used by experts to reach an appropriate \n\nestimate for the damages incurred will vary on the applicable legal rule and the factual \n\ncircumstances of the case. The most common methods used in the quantification of damages are \n\nthe comparator based methods, which can be further refined by applying econometric techniques. \n\nThese methods include the Before and After and Yardstick as well as the Differences-in-\n\nDifferences.  \n\nAnother common method is the Simulation model. Experts simulate a market outcome based on \n\neconomic models of competition that replicate drivers of supply and demand conditions. \n\nHowever, the simulation model faces more scrutiny from courts and are often times disregarded \n\nas an appropriate method. This is due to the difficulty that non-experts face in understanding the \n\nmodel and its assumptions and also due to the strong assumptions that are made regarding the \n\n\"would-be\" demand curve in a competitive economic environment. A third common method is \n\nthe Cost-plus approach.  \n\n                                                 \n51 Clark, E. et al, \"Study on the Conditions of Claims for Damages in Case of Infringement of EC Competition \nRules: Analysis of Economic Models for the Calculation of Damages.\" Ashurt, 2004. \n52 Verboven, F. and  Dijk, van T., \"Cartel Damages Claims and the Passing on Defense.\" The Journal of Industrial \nEconomics, Vol LVII, No 3, 2009. pp. 457-491. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nIt is important to observe that differently from the United States law, the European law allows \n\ninfringers to use the pass-on defense in order to reduce the amount of damages due.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Brazil \n\nEven though Brazil's competition regime has been developing into a more mature regulatory \n\nsystem, it is still lagging behind other major countries in terms of antitrust enforcement. Antitrust \n\nlaw enforcement was first created in 1994, following the opening of the Brazilian economy in the \n\nlate 1980s53. It constituted of 3 agencies whose enforcement responsibilities constantly \n\noverlapped, leading to an inefficient and time consuming process. In 2011, the new Competition \n\nLaw reconstructed the antitrust system, centralizing all preventive and repressive functions under \n\none single agency, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica (\"CADE\"). Under the \n\nformer Competition Act, antitrust violations were subject to fines of 1% to 30% of gross \n\nrevenues registered by the violating firm in the year before the initiation of investigations54. \n\nHowever, this guideline was so broad that it led to series controversies and inconsistencies when \n\ncalculating the fines. CADE sometimes considered the firm's entire revenue, whereas other times \n\nit just included the firm's revenues derived directly from the  infringement. Therefore, the 2011 \n\nCompetition Act narrowed down its guidelines in order to establish a closer link between fine \n\nand the amount of commerce affected. Under the new law, violations are subject to fines ranging \n\nfrom 0.01% to 20% of annual gross revenues registered by the company in the year before the \n\ninitiation of investigations in the field of business of the infringement. This led to an open \n\ninterpretation on how to define the \"field of business\". Some experts argue that fields of business \n\nencloses only the products and services affected by the company's anticompetitive conduct. \n\nHowever, a broader interpretation, usually the one antitrust authorities follow, argues that it can \n\ninclude other product or services that may be considered part of the same activity involved in the \n\nillegal conduct. This uncertainty on how to apply the fields of business to calculate fines leads to \n\n                                                 \n53 Duarte, Leonardo Maniglia and Rodrigo Alves dos Santos, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil, \"Cartel \nSettlements in Brazil: Recent Developments and Upcoming Challenges,\" S\u00e3o Paulo: IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, \npp. 285-313 \n54 Martinez, Ana Paula and Mariana Tavares de Araujo, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil,  \"Anti-cartel \nEnforcement in Brazil: Status Quo &amp; Trends,\" S\u00e3o Paulo:IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, pp. 257-274 \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nrisks of including unrelated businesses in the calculation and thus the application of \n\ndisproportional fines.  \n\nEven though major developments in the regulatory system is still required, since 2003, hard core \n\ncartels has been gaining growing attention from antitrust authorities. Authorities implemented \n\nthe leniency program and built a strong network with criminal prosecutors in order to gain access \n\nto more sophisticated investigative techniques55. To determine a fair and proportional fine the \n\nCADE takes into account a series of factors: i) level of seriousness of the infringement; ii) good \n\nfaith of the defendant and its wiliness to help with the investigations; iii) gains or potential gains \n\nobtained from the violation; iv) whether or not the conduct has actually been consummated; v) \n\nlevel of actual or potential harm to competition, the economy, consumers and other third parties; \n\nvi) detrimental effects to the economy; vii) economic situation of the defendant; viii) recidivism \n\n(if defendant has a prior history of anticompetitive behavior, fines can be doubled). The level of \n\nfines when the case is supported with direct evidence tend to be higher. Also, payment of \n\nantitrust fines does not release defendant from having to repair damages in a potential private \n\nlawsuit56. \n\nBesides being an administrative offense, cartel is also considered a crime punishable by \n\nimprisonment. Usually, the penalty ranges from 2 to 5 years but it may increase by up to 50% if \n\nillegal conduct caused serious harm to consumers or were active in markets essential to life. \n\nIn recent years, antitrust authorities have also been encouraging damage litigation by potential \n\ninjured parties leading to a surge in class actions aimed at the recovering of collective or \n\nindividual damages. By encouraging victims to claim damages, the CADE is able to amplify its \n\ndeterrence effect. CADE's function are restricted to preventing and repressing anticompetitive \n\nconducts, therefore it is not concerned with the measurement and quantification of actual damage \n\nthat may have been caused by an offender; damage recovery is addressed in private class or \n\nindividual actions. Victims of anticompetitive behavior are allowed to file suit even of CADE \n\nhas decided no violation has occurred, and they do not have to wait for CADE's final decision. \n\n                                                 \n55 Duarte, Leonardo Maniglia and Rodrigo Alves dos Santos, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil, \"Cartel \nSettlements in Brazil: Recent Developments and Upcoming Challenges,\" S\u00e3o Paulo:IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, \npp. 285-313 \n56 Martinez, Ana Paula and Mariana Tavares de Araujo, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil,  \"Anti-cartel \nEnforcement in Brazil: Status Quo &amp; Trends,\" S\u00e3o Paulo: IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, pp. 257-274 \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nThe Brazilian Civil Code set out the right for victim to obtain compensation for any damages \n\nsuffered due to wrongful and unlawful behavior. Plaintiffs may seek damages of all types, \n\nincluding pecuniary losses or pain-and-suffering. As a general rule, the burden of proof lies with \n\nthe plaintiff, however, it may shift to the defendant if the courts find that there is a significant \n\nasymmetry of information and economic means. \n\nThe evidences usually included in collusion cases include testimony of relevant witnesses, any \n\ndocuments from the participating firms, and expert examinations. Economic experts may request \n\nany economic information of the parties involved in order to calculate loss profits or illegal \n\novercharges applied to the goods and services in question. There are no mandatory form of \n\nquantifying damages; experts have to consider the benefits and challenges of each method and \n\nchoose which one they deem more appropriate.   \n\nFinally, Brazilian law also allows for the introduction of the pass-on defense. The Civil Code \n\nstates that indemnification must be measured according to the extent of the damage, which \n\nmeans it cannot exceed what was in fact lost by the victim. Therefore, whatever fraction of the \n\novercharge that was passed-on to the end consumer should not be incorporated in the damage \n\ncalculation. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to show that there was no overcharge \n\npassed on to the end consumer57.          \n\n \n\n3.4 Administrative vs. Judicial: Defining their role in cartel punishment \n\n \nA lot of discussion has been arising in recent years over the role of the antitrust agency \n\nconcerning the calculation of damages and punishment for an infringing firm. Many experts \n\nargue that the role of a competition authority is solely to investigate and punish an antitrust \n\nviolator. Others argue for a broader scope in the role of the agency in quantifying the damages to \n\nsociety. In Brazil, Law no. 12.529/11 states that what matters when determining the penalty for \n\nan antitrust violation is the undue advantages gained by the company and not necessarily the \n\nharm that the conduct caused to society. \n\n                                                 \n57 Magalh\u00e3es, C., et al, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil. \"Private Antitrust Damages.\" S\u00e3o \nPaulo:IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, pp 395-414. \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nEven though calculating damages is not a specified role for the CADE, Ms. Cristiane Alkmin, \n\nadvisor to the CADE, highlighted that damage quantification by antitrust agencies is becoming \n\nan international trend and Brazil should follow suit. She argues that not only should CADE be \n\nresponsible for the damage calculation, but also that the Judiciary branch should take into \n\nconsideration their calculation when awarding damages in civil suits.  \n\nA similar stand was taken by Auriol et. al (2016) in their working paper. They defend that a more \n\nefficient solution for penalizing antitrust infringers and to strengthen the regulation of a \n\nmisconduct is to establish a better collaboration and integration of different law enforcement \n\nfunctions and institutions. In other words, the different Government institutions must work \n\ntogether and in the same direction instead of opposing each other. They argue for a centralized \n\ndatabase where Government share information on firm's offenses and leniency agreements or \n\nsettlements with antitrust authorities in order to strengthen coordination.    \n\n \n\nChapter 4 - A Case Study on Liquefied Petroleum Gas Cartel \n\n \n\nThis chapter gives an overview on the liquefied petroleum gas market and analyze the LPG \n\ndistribution price cartel instated in Par\u00e1, Brazil. We will then apply some of the empirical \n\nmethods previously discussed in order to calculate the estimated damages of the collusion. \n\n     \n\n4.1 The LPG Market in Brazil: An Overview \n \n\nThe liquefied petroleum gas, commonly known as cooking gas, can be resold in liquid form in \n\npressure canisters after it has been produced or imported. The 13 Kg canister (P13) is normally \n\nused in households for cooking and it is one of the most commonly used gas in Brazil58.  \n\n                                                 \n58 LPG may also be stored in recipients that vary from 2 to 90kg to be consumed in industrial or commercial areas. \nHowever, this study will focus on the P13 cylinders, which are more widely consumed in Brazil. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nFigure 5 illustrates the chain of production of LPG. The producer or importer sells the product to \n\nthe distributing companies and the distributors resell it to the industrial segment, retailers or \n\ndirectly to consumers in the commercial, residential or institutional segments. In addition from \n\nbeing able to buy the LPG directly from the distributors, consumers can also buy it from several \n\nretailers registered by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo (\"ANP\"). The most common form of \n\nLPG found in the retail segment is the 13 Kg pressure cylinders or canisters, exclusively for \n\nhousehold use.   \n\nFigure 4: LPG chain of production and distribution \n\n \n\n \n\nTo analyze the competitive environment of LPG distribution, one has to look at three \n\nfundamental aspects: the nature of the product, the logistics in distribution and the characteristics \n\nof the regulation in the sector. It is important to note that from the point of view of the consumer, \n\nSource: Petrobras website \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nthe competition that matters is the one that takes place in the level of distribution and not in the \n\nresale59. The LPG is a homogenous product with qualities that are not differentiable to the \n\nconsumer in the purchasing act. For this reason, the company's only way of distinguishing itself \n\nfrom its competitors lies in the quality of the distribution services rendered to consumers. This \n\nmakes the LPG a product with very low substitutability and no alternative service to the \n\ndistribution service provided. In addition, since it is a highly regulated market, there is a high \n\nbarrier to entry in the market of LPG distribution. In the state of Par\u00e1, there are three main LPG \n\ndistributors that have complete control over the market: Minasgas, Paragas and Tropigas. Due to \n\nthe inelastic demand of the product and to the high concentration of the market, it becomes easy \n\nfor companies to determine not only the price that retailers pay for the product but also the price \n\nthey sell it to consumers.  \n\nSince 1954 up to the mid 1990s, the price policy for petroleum derivatives, including the LPG, \n\nhad been strongly regulated by government agencies as a strategy to standardize price throughout \n\nthe country. Throughout the 1980s, the LPG market was regulated by Resolution no 13/76, which \n\nnot only regulated the price practiced by distributors and resellers, but also determined that the \n\nresellers were only allowed to represent one distributor. They also established the necessary \n\nrequirements for a company to operate as a distributor and reseller, determining specifics for the \n\nstorage and handling, transport and sale of the product. In 1989, Resolution no 04/89 revoked the \n\nprevious resolution proposing a new system where retailers were allowed to buy from more than \n\none distributor. The price deregulating process, however, initiated in the mid 1990s with the new \n\nregulation Ordinance from the Brazilian Treasury Bureau (\"Ordinance MF\") no 195/96, which \n\nfixed the revenues from LPG ex-refineries and ended price control over the transportation and \n\ndistribution and resale margins. A couple of years later, the Ordinance MF no 322/98 deregulated \n\nthe price of LPG sold in bulk or packed in pressure canisters to wholesalers and retailers from \n\nthe South and Southeast of Brazil which would later extend to the whole country in 2001. In \n\n2003 Ordinance from Brazilian Oil and Gas Agency (\"Ordinance ANP\") no 297/2003 expressly \n\nallowed retailers to buy from more than one distributor, with the intent that a bigger pressure \n\nfrom resellers would eventually decrease the final price of the product. However, distributors \n\noperating in the state of Par\u00e1 were not satisfied with this new resolution and started creating \n\n                                                 \n59Ara\u00fajo, J. Tavares, \"O Papel da Marca no Setor GLP,\" Ecostrat Consultores. 2010. \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\ndifficulties for retailers to obtain a license from more than one distributor. Based on evidence \n\ncollected during the investigations, whenever a reseller would request to work with an additional \n\ndistributor, they would be denied for various unfounded reasons, which made it quite impossible \n\nfor them to work with a multi-distributor system. In addition, Tropig\u00e1s, one of the distributors in \n\nthe state, requested that their resellers sign an exclusivity agreement. Whenever the resellers \n\nrefused to sign the document, they would face several retaliation from the distributors; they \n\nwould be charged a higher price on the LPG or the distributor would sell directly to clandestine \n\nresellers at a lower price, basically leading the old resellers to bankruptcy60.   \n\n \n\n4.2 The Case \n \n\nIn March 2005, the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Revendedores de G\u00e1s Liquefeito de Petr\u00f3leo \n\n(\"Fergas\"), made a complaint to CADE about potential anticompetitive practices being carried \n\nout by the three mains gas distributors in the state of Par\u00e1: Tropig\u00e1s, Minasg\u00e1s and Par\u00e1gas. \n\nIn December 2016, CADE sentenced the company Par\u00e1gas Distribuidora Ltda. for the formation \n\nof an illegal cartel in the liquefied petroleum gas distribution market.61 According to the leading \n\nopinion, the evidence in the case files showed that Par\u00e1gas was guilty of implementing a price \n\nfixing scheme with its competitors. Furthermore, the firm was found guilty of creating vertical \n\nrestrictions, such as fixing retail prices, refusing to supply the LPG to retailers from other \n\ndistributors, for requiring its retailers to sign exclusivity agreements, and finally for selling the \n\nLPG to unauthorized retailers, as means to enforce the collusion. \n\nThe CADE advisor responsible for the leading opinion, Ms. Cristiane Alkmin, interpreted that in \n\norder to apply an appropriate fine to the colluding firm, the best approach is to calculate the \n\nestimated overcharge and undue gains for the firm. She suggests that, \"when pecuniary sanctions \n\nare not a function of the damage caused to society, one can make the mistake of charging beyond \n\n                                                 \n60 CADE Administrative Process 08012.006043/2008-37 \n61 According to the case files, all three companies in the cartel were found guilty of the collusion, however, Tropigas \nand Minasgas entered into a leniency agreement and settled with CADE and were therefore not tried together with \nPar\u00e1gas. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nor below the 'appropriate penalty' for that damage that was caused to society.62\" If the fines paid \n\nby the infringing firms  are equal to the overcharge sum, the damage to society will not even be \n\nrepaired. The advantage gained through an illicit act is different than the actual damages suffered \n\nby society as a whole; it only accounts for the sum of the overcharge (total overprice observed \n\nduring the cartel x total quantity sold during the cartel), disregarding the deadweight loss. \n\nHowever, in her opinion, calculating damages, even if just an estimate, can serve as a reference \n\nfor the establishment of the fine.   \n\nIn the LPG case, the variables for cartel duration, quantity sold, and the price fixed by the cartel \n\nwere available in the evidence collected. The counterfactual price was to be calculated by a \n\nchosen method for damage estimation. For this case, she chose the difference-in-difference \n\napproach. The damage calculation will be a proxy of the sum of the undue gains by the \n\nparticipating firms in the cartel during its duration.  \n\nThe relevant market considered for the calculation was the LPG distribution in the state of Par\u00e1. \n\nThe selected period for the cartel was from February 2003 to April 2005 and the non-cartel \n\nperiod was August 2001 through January 2003. For the control group, she used two criteria for \n\nselection. In the first group, she selected the states that showed the most competitive prices, \n\ntaking the average LPG price in each state and comparing it to the HHI. As she observed, the \n\nmore companies acting in that market, the lower was the average price of the state. The chosen \n\nstates were: RJ, AL, SP, and MG. For the second control group, she selected all the states in \n\nBrazil where there had been no cartel condemnations during the period.     \n\n However, her methods were scrutinized by another voting member, Mr. Marcio Oliveira. \n\nAlthough both advisors agreed on the fact that the companies were guilty of cartel formation, \n\nMr. Oliveira disagreed with some of the premises of the model applied in the calculation as well \n\nas with the chosen method for setting the fine.  \n\nFirst, he interprets that it is not CADE's role to recover damages but in fact to establish a penalty \n\nfor these anticompetitive practices. When relying solely in overcharges to calculate the penalty, \n\none is not taking into consideration other undue advantages gained from the collusion, such as \n\nthe exclusion of a potential competitor from the market. In addition, one cannot guarantee that all \n\n                                                 \n62 CADE Administrative Process 08012.006043/2008-37  - Vote 0255038 \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\novercharges will eventually become an undue gain to the company; part of the increase in the \n\nequilibrium price may be due to shocks that would have affected the market regardless of the \n\ncartel. In Baker (1989), he elaborated on the difficulty of identifying cartel formation when there \n\nis an environment of uncertainty concerning price.63 Simply calculating estimated overcharges \n\ndoes not allow you to differentiate undue gains from natural market fluctuations. Therefore, Mr. \n\nOliveira argued that a better method would be to take an average of the overcharges result from \n\nmultiple approaches, so to avoid under or oversetting the fine. \n\nFurthermore, Mr. Oliveira showed concerns on Ms. Alkmin's choice for the control group. He \n\nstated that it is impossible to know for a fact whether a specific state was a good counterfactual \n\nfor the estimate, since even if there was no cartel condemned in the chosen states during the \n\nperiod of the study, it does not guarantee that no cartel was in place. This is a common criticism \n\nto the difference-in-difference method; although there are some steps that can be taken to secure \n\na control group with benchmarks that have not be affected by the shock, it is impossible to know \n\nfor sure.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Empirical Analysis \n \n\nIn this section, we revisit Ms. Alkmin's calculations in order to provide more robustness to the \n\nresults. First, besides using the difference-in-difference method as the only means of calculation \n\nas was done by the CADE, we added a second model to estimate the damage. We start the \n\ndamage evaluation with a multivariate before and after approach and then move on to the \n\ndifference-in-difference to corroborate our results. All the calculations were performed using the \n\nStata v.14 software and the results can be found in Appendix A.  \n\nTo mitigate the concerns raised by Mr. Oliveira on the validity of the benchmark for the \n\ndifference-in-difference model, the states chosen for the control group were selected with more \n\nscrutiny. In addition to choosing states based on their market competitiveness, like was done by \n\nCADE, we also tested for a common tendency in those states to avoid using a control group that \n\n                                                 \n63 Baker, Jonathan, \"Identifying Cartel Policing under Uncertainty: The U. S. Steel Industry, 1933-1939,\" The \nJournal of Law and Economics Vol 32, no. 2, Part 2 (1989): S47-S76. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nhad factors influencing price that were absent in the treatment state. This allows us to test for the \n\ncommon trend hypothesis in the difference-in-difference method and to increase the robustness \n\nof our results.            \n\nIn order to estimate the damage caused by the LPG cartel in Par\u00e1 we used the information \n\navailable in the discovery process as well as data collected from public sources. The dates \n\nestablished for the cartel period were the same ones used by CADE in their damage calculations, \n\nFebruary 2003 to April 2005. Analyzing the cartel in the same time interval as CADE allows for \n\nthe comparison of our results with the ones obtained by Ms. Alkmin. We used the ANP64 portal \n\nto obtain monthly data for the distribution and retail price of LPG sold in pressure canisters (P-\n\n13) in each state from July 2001 to December 2016. Figure 6, illustrates the behavior of the two \n\nprice series. Although there are evidences of price fixing at the retail level (a demand by the \n\ndistributors themselves),65 it was chosen to use the series for distribution price, where there are \n\nconcrete evidence of a price fixing scheme.  \n\nFigure 5: Average Distribution and Retail LPG Price in Par\u00e1 \n\n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n64 Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo - Brazilian Oil and Gas Agency \n65 In the discovery process, retailers claimed that distributors would determine the prices that should be practiced \nwith the final consumer. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nJu\nl?\n0\n1\n\nA\np\nr?\n0\n2\n\nJa\nn\n?0\n3\n\nO\nc\nt?\n0\n3\n\nJu\nl?\n0\n4\n\nA\np\nr?\n0\n5\n\nJa\nn\n?0\n6\n\nO\nc\nt?\n0\n6\n\nJu\nl?\n0\n7\n\nA\np\nr?\n0\n8\n\nJa\nn\n?0\n9\n\nO\nc\nt?\n0\n9\n\nJu\nl?\n1\n0\n\nA\np\nr?\n1\n1\n\nJa\nn\n?1\n2\n\nO\nc\nt?\n1\n2\n\nJu\nl?\n1\n3\n\nA\np\nr?\n1\n4\n\nJa\nn\n?1\n5\n\nO\nc\nt?\n1\n5\n\nJu\nl?\n1\n6\n\nAvg\u00a0Distribution\u00a0Price Avg\u00a0Retail\u00a0Price\n\nSource: Data collected from ANP \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nBesides LPG distribution price, proxies for demand shifters were used as independent variables \n\nto control for exogenous factors that could affect the dependent variable and potentially mislead \n\nthe final conclusions on the effect of the cartel. For such, were used LPG consumption, provided \n\nby the ANP, income and industrial production, collected from IPEA Data and IBGE, \n\nrespectively. This data can be found in Appendix B. \n\nFor LPG apparent consumption, data was only available from 2007 to 2016, in Kilogram units. \n\nTherefore, LPG distribution sales was collected from the ANP website and used as a proxy for \n\nconsumption from 2000 to 2006. This data came in m3 units, therefore it was converted to \n\nKilograms using 550 Kg/m3.  \n\nAlso, a dummy variable was created to indicate the periods in which the cartel was active.  \n\nUnfortunately, data on cost shifters were not publicly available and they were not included in our \n\nempirical analysis. In the case of the LPG distribution market, the main cost variable that could \n\npotentially affect price would be the transportation cost, which constitutes of over 50% of the \n\ntotal cost of the product66. This raises a couple of problems: first, the cost is a determinant of \n\nLPG prices and therefore our regression estimates may be plagued by omitted variable bias. This \n\nmay create endogeneity issues in both the before and after multivariate analysis and the \n\ndifference-in-difference approaches. This should not be a problem in the difference-in-difference \n\nmethod if the unobserved cost shifters vary in similar way across cartelized and non-cartelized \n\nmarkets. If the cost structure is similar, than they would cancel out when calculating the \n\ndifferences. However, it may become a problem for the difference-in-difference approach if cost \n\nstructure of the LPG distributors in Par\u00e1 are different than those in the control group. Second, \n\nlack of cost information prevents us from employing structural methods such as the cost-plus or \n\nsimulation approaches. Therefore, in this study we will work with an implicit assumption that the \n\ntransportation costs for LPG firms vary in a similar way across treatment and control groups \n\nmarkets.     \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n66 http://www.petrobras.com.br/pt/produtos-e-servicos/composicao-de-precos/gas-liquefeito-de-petroleo-glp/ \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n4.3.1 Multivariate \"Before and After\" Approach Applied \n\nFor this approach, we ran a regression with the LPG distribution price in Par\u00e1 against the \n\nindependent variables in the periods before and after the cartel, represented by the dummy \n\nvariable. The model specification follows: \n\n    \n\n\t \t \t  \n \n\n = vector of demand factors that affect price \n = dummy variable representing active cartel period (Dt =1 active cartel; Dt = 0 no cartel) \n\n \n \n\nThe coefficients ? and ? are the parameters to be estimated. The vector of demand factors that \naffect price include industrial production , LPG consumption and income. \n\nIn this case, we are looking to analyze the coefficient ?, since it will represent the magnitude of \n\nthe price increase during the cartel period. The results are shown in Table 1:  \n\nTable 1: Regression Output \n\n \n\n1 2 3 4\n\nLog\tIncome 0.131* 0.0163 0.0174 ?0.0352\n\n[.0515] [.0633] [.0632] [.0544]\n\nIndustrial\tProduction 0.0086*** .0075*** .0075*** \t.0034***\n\n[.00044] [.00055] [.00057] 0.00071\n\nCartel\tPeriod .132*** 0.127*** .1302*** .1015***\n\n[.0162] [.0159] [.0158] [.014]\n\nConsumption 0.00000758**\n\n[2.54e?06]\n\nLog\tConsumption .2029** \t?.2525**\n\n[.0683] [.0821]\n\nTrend .0027***\n\n[.000345]\n\nConstant 1.561*** 2.305*** ?0.842 7.155***\n\n[.3595] [.4307] [.8821] [1.264]\n\nN 168 168 168 168\n\nR\n2\n\n0.8073 0.8172 0.8171 0.8677\n\nF 228.97 182.21 182.11 212.57\n\n*\tp\t<\t0.05,\t**\tp\t<\t0.01,\t***\tp\t<\t0.001\n\nDependent\tVariable:\tLog\tDistribution\tPrice\n\nDamage\tEstimation\n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nResults from Table 1 show that an increase in income and industrial production seems to lead to \n\nan increase in the LPG distribution price. This seems to be the case with consumption as well. \n\nHowever, when trend is added to the regression, the signs for consumption and income change, \n\nwhich could be a consequence of the endogeneity problem.   \n\nNow observing the dummy coefficient, it is possible to conclude that LPG distribution prices \n\nwere between 10% to 13% higher while the cartel was active. Not only were all the ? coefficient \n\nstatistically significant but also they showed little variation given the different independent \n\nvariable used, corroborating the robustness of the model.  \n\nFollowing Ivaldi et al. (2016) and Levenstein, Suslow and Oswald (2003)67, it was considered \n\nsales affected by the collusive practice in order to calculate the cartel's excess profits derived \n\nfrom the price overcharge.68 Total LPG sales throughout the cartel period was of R$ \n\n7,722,887,257 amounting damages to something in between R$ 783,873,056 to R$ \n\n1,016,331,963.69  \n\nHowever, the multivariate before and after methodology can be somewhat limited when \n\nestimating damages since it only analyzes the market in Par\u00e1, where the cartel was instated. In \n\norder to have a more reliable estimate for the damages, it is important to compare the affected \n\nmarket with a market that has been operating cartel free.  \n\nThe difference-in-difference method, takes into consideration cartel-free markets that can be \n\nused as a counterfactual for the analysis.   \n\n \n \n\n \n                                                 \n67 Ivaldi, M. et al, \"Cartel Damages to the Economy: An Assessment for Developing Countries,\" Competition Law \nEnforcement in the BRICS and in Developing Countries. Switzerland Springer, 2016. pp. 103-133 \n68 The value for total LPG sales in the distribution level was arrived at by multiplying the LPG sales from February \n2003 to April 2005 with the respective monthly LPG distribution price. To arrive at the damages, we used a \nvariation of Equation 1, but in percentage, where A = (p1-p0) x Q1 or the total sales multiplied by the ? = (p1-p0)/p0 , \nin this case 10% to 13%.  \n69 LPG sales are described in the values of 2005, when the cartel ended. If we update these values up to December \n2016 using the IPCA, LPG sales would have been R$ 14,929,176,194 in today's terms. That would equal damages in \nbetween R$ 1.5 - R$ 1.9 billions. \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n4.3.2 Difference-in-Difference Applied \n\n In order to apply the difference-in-difference approach to estimate cartel damage, one must first \n\nidentify the treatment and control groups, as well as the period the cartel was active. In addition, \n\nthe analyst has to determine the method and model specifications. It is important to point out that \n\nthe choice of control group was an important element of discussion between CADE advisors in \n\ntheir opinion. As previously mentioned, the difference-in-difference method requires two basic \n\nassumptions: i) the markets for the control group must not be affected by the cartel; and that ii) \n\nthe prices in the different markets must follow a common trend70. These groups should have \n\nsimilar characteristics, except for the price shock. The treatment group, in this case, will be the \n\nstate of Par\u00e1 and the endogenous variable the LPG distribution price. The period of the cartel \n\nconsidered will be from February 2003 to March 2005 (27 months), the same period used by \n\nCADE to calculate the damage.71 The data collected for the control group was retrieved from the \n\nsame sources used to collect the data for the state of Par\u00e1: ANP, IPEA Data, IBGE.    \n\nIn order to satisfy the first requirement for the difference-in-difference method, the first objective \n\nwas to select states where there had been no cartel activity in the market in question during the \n\nperiod being studied. However, knowing for a fact that a market is cartel free is nearly \n\nimpossible. Just because no cartels had been condemned during that period, it does not mean that \n\nthere was no cartel. Due to the difficulty of detecting cartels, it is possible that a cartel could be \n\noperating in any given state without the knowledge of the authorities. Therefore,  the states \n\nwhich demonstrated to have a lower market concentration based on the Herfindahl Index (HHI) \n\nwere the main focus of the analysis. The HHI was calculated for all the states in Brazil in 200772 \n\nand in 2016. Although this method does not eliminate the danger of using a state where a cartel \n\nwas active but unknown, it is a way to mitigate these risks. Based on the HHI, were chosen the \n\nstates of S\u00e3o Paulo, Pernambuco, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1, which were the only four states \n\nwhich presented a HHI below 0.25 in 2007 and maintained a similar level of competitiveness in \n\n2016, as seen on Figure 7.  \n                                                 \n70 Lucinda, Claudio and Renato Seixas, \"Preven\u00e7\u00e3o \u00d3tima de Cart\u00e9is: O Caso dos Per\u00f3xidos no Brasil.\" \nDepartamento de Estudos Econ\u00f4micos do CADE. (2016). \n71 In order to determine the estimated period for the cartel activity, CADE used evidence collected during the \ninvestigation, including recordings from company employees and other documents that indicated a February as the \nmost probable date for the beginning of the cartel and March 2005 as its dissolution.  \n72 The year of 2007 was the earliest data available for LPG consumption. As mentioned earlier, for the years \nbetween 2000 to 2006, a proxy was used.  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nFigure 6: Herfindahl Index \n\n \n\n \n\nTo satisfy the second condition for the difference-in-difference model, the prices for the state of \n\nPar\u00e1 and the control group were tested for a common trend. The first analysis consisted of a \n\nvisual inspection of the LPG distribution prices in both the treatment and control groups.  \n\nIn Figure 8, it is possible to see that Par\u00e1's price curve becomes steeper than that of the other \n\nstates around March 2003. Although there is an upward trend in price among all the states, it \n\nseems that the increase in Par\u00e1 around the period of the beginning of the cartel was more \n\nsignificant than in the others state of the control group.  \n\n \n\nSP 0.2368 GO 0.2047\n\nPE 0.2406 MG 0.2122\n\nSC 0.2412 SP 0.2154\n\nPR 0.2424 PR 0.2216\n\nGO 0.2504 MT 0.2256\n\nMT 0.2578 SC 0.2264\n\nMS 0.2645 PE 0.2446\n\nMG 0.2736 MS 0.2452\n\nRS 0.2943 MA 0.2493\n\nRJ 0.2987 RS 0.2604\n\nMA 0.3044 AL 0.2665\n\nAL 0.3078 DF 0.2715\n\nES 0.3096 RJ 0.2735\n\nBA 0.3112 ES 0.2767\n\nSE 0.3155 CE 0.28\n\nRN 0.3204 BA 0.285\n\nPI 0.3382 PB 0.3075\n\nCE 0.3423 PA 0.3154\n\nTO 0.3532 TO 0.3201\n\nPB 0.3534 SE 0.3203\n\nPA 0.3632 RN 0.3229\n\nDF 0.4773 PI 0.325\n\nRO 0.5016 AP 0.3856\n\nRR 0.564 RO 0.5209\n\nAM 0.6004 AM 0.5442\n\nAP 0.638 AC 0.5939\n\nAC 0.6495 RR 0.6832\n\nHHI\u00a02007 HHI\u00a02016\n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nFigure 7: LPG Distribution Prices \n\n \n\n Source: Data collected from ANP \n\n  \n\nIn addition, a more formal trend test was performed in order to confirm the conclusions from the \n\nvisual inspection and give us more reliable results.

The coefficients for Santa Catarina and \n\nParan\u00e1, on the other hand, strongly suggest the contrary, which means that some shock other than \n\nthe cartel is making the trend in these states diverge from the one in Par\u00e1. This leads us to \n\nreconsider them as a good benchmark for the control group.      \n\nLastly, a local common trend test, which allows for the treatment variable to interact with time \n\ndummies, was carried out. The objective of this test was to create interactions of time dummies \n\nand the treatment indicator for the first two pre-treatment periods and two post-treatment periods. \n\nAfter creating the pre and post-treatment dummies, the following model was regressed:        \n\n  ( 6 ) \n\nwhere y is the outcome for state i at time t and ? and ? are state and time fixed effects. \n\nIn order to validate the difference-in-difference assumption, the pre-treatment dummies should \n\nbe the same for both the control and treatment groups, which means that they should not be \n\nstatistically significant. In addition, the post-treatment coefficients, ?+1 and ?+2, should be \n\npositive and statistically significant. The intuition here is that prices should follow a common \n\ntrend in the pre-treatment period and diverge after the shock in the post-treatment period.       \n\n Table 3 shows the results of the local common trend test. Column 1 includes all four states in the \n\ncontrol group throughout the entire period, July 2001 through December 2016. Column 2 \n\nshortens the time frame of the analysis to a short period before and after the beginning to the \n\ncartel, that is January 2002 through December 2003.73 The reason for decreasing the range period \n\nbeing analyzed was to avoid capturing any other shocks that might have taken place in the LPG \n\ndistribution price besides the cartel in the post-treatment period. Columns 3 and 4 follow the \n\nsame considerations as Columns 1 and 2, respectively, but only include S\u00e3o Paulo and \n\nPernambuco in the control group.    \n\n                                                 \n73 Remembering that according to the evidence collected by CADE, the beginning of the cartel was dated in \nFebruary 2003 and its dissolution was considered to have taken place in April 2005. Therefore, I chose to consider a \nperiod one year before its beginning and 10 months after. Columns 2 and 4 of the local common trend test does not \nconsider the entire period of the cartel. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nTable 3: Local Common Trend Test \n\n \n\n \n\nBased on the results for Column 1, we reject the null hypothesis at a 90% confidence level for \n\nthe month of  April 2003, but not at 95%. This seems to be saying that the price increase of the \n\ncartel started to pick up at around the month of April and not in February when the cartel was \n\nactually instated. Moreover, in the joint significance test for the months of December 2002 and \n\nMarch 2003, we do not reject the null hypothesis, ?-1= ?-2=0, reinforcing the conclusions from \n\nthe previous tests that there is in a common tendency between the treatment and control groups \n\nbefore the cartel shock. However, for the post treatment joint significant test, ?1= ?2=0, we reject \n\nthe null hypothesis, proving that there was in fact a shock in that period. \n\nThe joint significance tests performed for the data in Columns 2 and 4 showed similar results. \n\nWe do not reject the null hypothesis for the pre-treatment period at a 5% significance level but \n\n1 2 3 4\n\nTrend 0.0803*** 0.3452*** 0.0764*** 0.3837***\n\n[\t0.0013] [0.0170] [0.0018] [0.0218]\n\nSP ?1.7163*** ?0.1163 ?1.7227*** ?0.1279\n\n[0.2235] [0.3898] [0.239] [0.3869]\n\nPE \t?.92683*** 0.6964 0.6849\n\n[0.2235] [0.3898] [0.3869]\n\nSC 2.6851*** 2.403***\n\n[0.2235] [0.3898]\n\nPR 0.0585 0.9112*\n\n[0.2235] [0.3898]\n\nDec?02 1.9969 2.1828 1.6923 2.1905\n\n[2.1571] [1.3192] [2.3085] [1.3092]\n\nJan?03 2.1702 2.0912 1.87 2.0604\n\n[2.1571] [1.3192] [2.3084] [1.3093]\n\nMar?03 2.9273 2.3185 2.6344 2.2108\n\n[2.1571] [1.32] [2.3082] [1.3106]\n\nApr?03 3.7493 2.8756* 3.4603 2.7294*\n\n[2.1569] [1.3207] [2.3081] [1.3118]\n\nConstant ?19.50*** ?156.11*** ?17.18*** ?175.93***\n\n[0.79] [8.77] [1.09] [11.24]\n\nN 935 120 561 72\n\nR\n2\n\n0.8207 0.8146 0.7697 0.8392\n\nF 470.45 53.72 264.02 47.73\n\n*\tp\t<\t0.05,\t**\tp\t<\t0.01,\t***\tp\t<\t0.001\n\nCommon\tTrend\n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nreject it for the post-treatment period.

As we can see from the output in Column 4, the overprice \n\nwas similar to that in Column 3, however slightly smaller.

This could \n\nindicate that there probably were other shocks influencing the LPG distribution prices in the two \n\nstates we excluded from the analysis.   \n\nAs we can see from the results, the price overcharge calculated by the difference-in-difference \n\nmethod utilizing a more restricted and scrutinized control group gave us a value much larger than \n\nwhat was estimated by Ms. Alkmin in her calculations for the CADE. However, it was consistent \n\nwith the conclusions arrived by Connor and Lande in their study in which they calculated the \n\nmodal average overcharges in between 10 to 20 percent. This shows how the difference-in-\n\ndifference model can be sensitive to the choice of a control group; restricting the control group \n\nmay have a significant influence on the results. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\nQuantifying cartel damages has been gaining momentum among antitrust authorities around the \n\nworld, Brazil included. Even though there have been major discussions on the role of a \n\ncompetition agency, more specifically on whether it has jurisdiction to calculate estimated \n\ndamages or not, it seems that more and more agencies been bringing it upon them to do so.  \n\nGiven the several different methodologies available for that purpose, analysts face the difficult \n\ntask of choosing the most appropriate approach for calculation while at the same time finding \n\nbalance between accuracy and practicality. As discussed along this paper, some methods are able \n\nto return more accurate results but they also require more data and assumptions and are much \n\nmore time consuming. On the other hand, there are other methods, such as before and after \n\napproaches and difference-in-difference methods, used in this paper to estimate damages, that are \n\nmore practical and less data intensive but gives less accurate results.      \n\nThe objective of this paper was to select among the existing methods, one that could give us \n\naccurate results in a timely manner. The Multivariate Before and After method indicated an \n\n                                                 \n75 Updating the damages up to December 2016 using the IPCA, we arrive at damages amount in between R$ 2.2 to \nR$ 2.4 billions. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\novercharge of between 10% to 13% in the distribution prices of LPG in Par\u00e1. The difference-in-\n\ndifference model estimated an overcharge of something in between 15.97% to 16.96%. These \n\nresult is consistent with the study performed by Connor and Lande (2008) where they caclulated \n\nthe mode of overcharges in between 10 to 20 percent. However, our results showed some \n\ninconsistencies with the same study; Connor and Lande concluded that the Before and After \n\nmethod gave higher overcharge results on average than other econometric models, such as the \n\ndifference-in-difference. Yet, results for our difference-in-difference method showed higher \n\nresults than the multivariate before and after method. Also, the results obtained in our study were \n\nhigher than the the results obtained by Ms. Alkmin in her difference-in-difference model: 4% to \n\n8.2%.      \n\nEven though the results from this study seem to be consistent with average overcharges found in \n\nthe academic literature and with the results calculated by CADE, there are always improvements \n\nthat can be made to refine the calculations even further. First, we could adopt the synthetic \n\ncontrol method in the difference-in-difference estimation to improve the results. The synthetic \n\ncontrol method builds on the difference-in-difference model to evaluate the causal effects of \n\nshocks. It makes two essential changes to the model: i) it allows for time-varying individual-\n\nspecific heterogeneity; and ii) takes a serious, data driven approach to forming counterfactuals. It \n\nbasically uses longitudinal data to build a weighted average of non-treated units that best \n\nreproduces the characteristics of the treated unit over time, prior to the treatment.76 This \n\napproach relaxes the previous hypothesis that the benchmark market should not be affected by \n\nthe shock and that there must be a common tendency between the treatment and control groups \n\nin the pre-treatment period. Therefore, it allows us to forgo the common tendency tests that were \n\nperformed in this study. However, like all other methods, it comes at a cost: its computational \n\ntime far exceeds that of the difference-in-difference estimation, leading us back to the \n\npracticality versus accuracy issue.    \n\nIn addition, it would be important that in future studies we find available data on cost shifters, \n\nmainly transportation costs, so to enable us to calculate the deadweight loss using the structural \n\nmodels. This would allow for the construction of a supply and demand structural model that \n\n                                                 \n76 Robbins, Michael et al., \"A Framework for Synthetic Control Methods with High-Dimensional, Micro-Level \nData,\" Rand Working Paper, 2015.   \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\ncould potentially calculate the impact of the total loss of welfare to society.
