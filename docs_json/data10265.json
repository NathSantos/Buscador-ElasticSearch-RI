This study represents one of the first contributions to the knowledge on the quantitative fidelity of the Recent freshwater\nmolluscan assemblages in subtropical rivers. Thanatocoenoses and biocoenoses were studied in straight and meandering to braided sectors,\nin the middle course of the Touro Passo River, a fourth-order tributary of the Uruguay River, located in the westernmost part of the State\nof Rio Grande do Sul. Samplings were carried out through quadrats of 5 m2, five in each sector. A total area of 50 m2 was sampled. Samplings\nwere also made in a lentic environment (abandoned meander), with intermittent communication with the Touro Passo River, aiming to\nrecord out-of-habitat shell transportation from the lentic communities to the main river channel. The results show that, despite the\nfrequent oscillation of the water level, the biocoenosis of the Touro Passo River shows high ecological fidelity and undergoes little\ninfluence from the lentic vicinal environments. The taxonomic composition and some features of the structure of communities,\nespecially the dominant species, also reflect some ecological differences between the two main sectors sampled, such as the complexity\nof habitats in the meandering-sector. Regarding the quantitative fidelity, 60% of the species found alive were also found dead and 47.3%\nof the species found dead were also found alive, at river-scale. However, 72% of the dead individuals belong to species also found alive.\nThis value might be related with the good rank order correlation obtained for live/dead assemblages. Consequently, the dominant species\nof the thanatocoenoses could be used to infer the ecological attributes of the biocoenoses. The values of all the indexes analyzed were\nvery variable in small-scale samplings (quadrat), but were more similar to others registered in previous studies, when they were analyzed\nin a station and river scale.\n\nKEYWORDS. Freshwater mollusks, taphonomy, death assemblages, life assemblages.\n\nRESUMO. Fidelidade quantitativa de associa\u00e7\u00f5es de moluscos l\u00edmnicos recentes na bacia do rio Touro Passo, Rio Grande\ndo Sul, Brasil. O presente estudo teve como objetivo apresentar uma das primeiras contribui\u00e7\u00f5es ao conhecimento sobre a fidelidade\nquantitativa de associa\u00e7\u00f5es de moluscos recentes em rios subtropicais. Tanatocenoses e biocenoses foram estudadas em se\u00e7\u00f5es retil\u00ednea e\nmeandrante tendendo a anastomosada, no curso m\u00e9dio do rio Touro Passo, um tribut\u00e1rio de 4\u00aa ordem do rio Uruguai, localizado no\nextremo oeste do Rio Grande do Sul. As amostragens foram realizadas por meio de quadrats de 5 m\n\n2\n, cinco em cada se\u00e7\u00e3o, amostrando-\n\nse um total de 50 m?. Tamb\u00e9m foram feitas amostragens em um ambiente l\u00eantico, com comunica\u00e7\u00e3o intermitente com o Touro Passo,\nobjetivando detectar a exist\u00eancia de transporte de comunidades l\u00eanticas para o interior do rio. Os resultados obtidos mostram que, apesar\nda freq\u00fcente oscila\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua, a biocenose do Touro Passo apresenta uma alta fidelidade ecol\u00f3gica e sofre pouca influ\u00eancia de\nesp\u00e9cies de ambientes l\u00eanticos. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f4mica e caracter\u00edsticas de estrutura de comunidades, especialmente as esp\u00e9cies\ndominantes, refletem, ainda, diferen\u00e7as ecol\u00f3gicas relacionadas \u00e0s duas se\u00e7\u00f5es amostradas, como a maior complexidade de habitats da\nesta\u00e7\u00e3o meandrante. Quanto \u00e0 fidelidade quantitativa, 60% das esp\u00e9cies encontradas vivas tamb\u00e9m foram encontradas mortas e 47,3%\ndas esp\u00e9cies encontradas mortas tamb\u00e9m foram encontras vivas em escala de rio. Por\u00e9m, 72% dos exemplares coletados mortos s\u00e3o\nrepresentantes de esp\u00e9cies encontradas vivas. Essa percentagem alta pode estar relacionada \u00e0 boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre o ranking de\ndomin\u00e2ncia das associa\u00e7\u00f5es vivas e mortas e, conseq\u00fcentemente, as esp\u00e9cies dominantes das tanatocenoses podem ser utilizadas para\ninferir caracter\u00edsticas ecol\u00f3gicas das biocenoses. Todos os \u00edndices analisados variaram muito em escala local (quadrat) e seus valores s\u00e3o\nmais aproximados aos de outros, registrados em estudos pr\u00e9vios, apenas quando analisados em escala mais ampla (se\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e1rea total).\n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE. Moluscos l\u00edmnicos, tafonomia, associa\u00e7\u00f5es mortas, associa\u00e7\u00f5es vivas.\n\nAccording to BEHRENSMEYER et al. (2000), the\nquantitative fidelity is \u201c ... the quantitative faithfulness of\nthe record of morphs, age classes, species richness,\nspecies abundance, trophic structure, etc. to the original\nbiological signal\u201d. In other words, it is the degree of the\nsimilarity between the life assemblage and the potential\ndeath assemblage. This \u201c degree of similarity\u201d is governed\nby an interaction of multiple extrinsic/intrinsic factors,\nsuch as (a) the source and rate of shell supply, (b) the\nvulnerability of skeletal hard parts to post-mortem\ndestruction or modification, and (c) the taphonomic\nconditions that the bioclasts are exposed in the\nenvironment of depositon (KIDWELL &amp; BOSENCE, 1991).\nTime-averaging (or temporal-mixing) is another important\nissue affecting the fidelity of death assemblages (WALKER\n\n&amp; BAMBACH, 1971). This phenomenon promotes the mixing\nof multiple non contemporaneous generations of shelly\norganisms and/or communities. Time-averaged death\nassemblages can be a product of multiple processes,\nincluding (a) the out-of-habitat transport of skeletal\nremains by storm-induced flows and currents, (b) extensive\nreworking by waves and currents, (c) intrastratal\nbiological activity, (d) selective destruction of species\nand/or preferable size-classes, and (e) sea-level\nfluctuations and rates of sedimentation (CUMMINS, 1994;\nKIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995; BEHRENSMEYER et al., 2000;\nKOWALEWSKI et al., 2003).\n\nThe vast majority of the studies on compositional\nfidelity has been conducted in shallow water marine to\ntransitional settings, including estuaries, lagoons, bays\n\n\n\n454\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9r. Zool., Porto Alegre, 96(4):453-465, 30 de dezembro de 2006\n\nMARTELLO, KOTZIAN &amp; SIM\u00d5ES\n\nand continental shelves. These focus primarily on\nmollusks, especially bivalves (KIDWELL &amp; BOSENCE, 1991;\nCUMMINS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995; BEHRENSMEYER\net al., 2000; KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003). Hence, as\nhighlighted by KOWALEWSKI et al. (2003), our view of this\nissue is biased toward specific taxonomic groups\n(bivalvocentric) and environments, lacking data for\nseveral shelly groups both from marine and continental\nenvironments. In spite of that, the data available shown\nthat the live/dead agreement is high (KIDWELL &amp; BOSENCE,\n1991; KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995) for the marine molluscan\nassemblages, but the dead/live agreement is variable\n(high, KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003 or low, KIDWELL &amp; BOSENCE,\n1991; KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995). Results may vary,\nhowever, according to the spatial scale employed in the\nanalysis (CUMMNIS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995;\nKOWALEWSKI et al., 2003). For example, low dead/live\nagreement is generally shown by assemblages\nrepresenting limited sampling strategies and\nencompassing small-scale coverage. Normally, the\ncommonest species with preservable hardparts are the\none better represented in the death assemblages,\nshowing good fidelity to the original life assemblages\n(KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995; KIDWELL, 2001).\n\nDespite its importance providing essential\npaleoecological and paleoclimatological information,\nshelly assemblages from freshwater systems have\nreceived far less attention in taphonomic studies than\nthe marine ones. The limited fidelity data available for\nmolluscan assemblages of this system have shown that\nthe live/dead agreement can be high (CUMMINS, 1994) or\nlow (PIP, 1988). However, these studies are also limited in\nterms of facies coverage, focusing primarily on lentic\nsettings (PIP, 1988; COHEN, 1989; CUMMINS, 1994). Here\nagain the taphonomic knowledge is biased toward some\nfacies or subenvironments. For typical lotic fluvial\nenvironments, where the currents can be an important\nagent of post-mortem out-of-habitat transportation of\nshells, only a few studies provided scarse, but important\ndata (e.g., BRIGGS et al., 1990; WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS,\n1994). These studies suggest that the different types of\nthe molluscan life and death assemblages tend to\naccumulate in distinct depositional settings (e.g., channel,\nflood plains, oxbow lakes) and are influenced by several\nbiotic and abiotic agents (see PIP, 1988, for a revision).\n\nThe Touro Passo River, a tributary of the Uruguay\nRiver basin, in the west of the State of Rio Grande do Sul,\nBrazil, provides a good opportunity for accessing the\nquantitative fidelity of fluvial molluscan shelly\nassemblages. According to \u00c9dson Oliveira (pers. comm.),\nat least three families and six genera of bivalve mollusks\nare thriving in the river nowadays. Because the low depth\nof the channel (~6 m) and the dry seasons, these shells\ncan be easily collected. In addition, several information\non the biology and ecology of the southern Brazilian\nfreshwater mollusks are available in the literature (e.g.\nVEITENHEIMER &amp; MANSUR, 1978; SILVA &amp; THOM\u00c9, 1981;\nLOPES-PITONI et al., 1984; LANZER &amp; VEITENHEIMER-\nMENDES, 1985; MANSUR &amp; GARCES, 1988; MANSUR et al.,\n1987, 1988, 1991, 1994, 2001, 2003b; PEREIRA et al. 2000a,b,\n2001; VEITENHEIMER-MENDES et al., 1990, 1992; LANZER,\n1991, 1996; OLIVEIRA &amp; MANSUR, 2001; FOCHT &amp;\n\nVEITENHEIMER-MENDES, 2001), complemented by studies\nin adjacent areas of the Uruguay and Argentina (see\nrevision in MARTINEZ &amp; ROJAS, 2004). Finally, the presence\nof Cenozoic Touro Passo Formation outcrops along the\nriver\u2019s margin, including mollusk-dominated assemblages\nof Pleistocene/Holocene ages (BOMBIN, 1976; OLIVEIRA &amp;\nMILDER, 1990), can offer valuable data for future\ncomparisons with the fidelity data presented here.\n\nIn the context above, the purpose of this\ncontribution is to analyze the quantitative fidelity of the\npresent-day molluscan assemblages that occur in distinct\nfluvial environments of the Touro Passo River in order to\nverify: (a) the ecological fidelity (sensu DAJOZ, 1978) of\nthe biocoenoses; (b) the paleoecological fidelity by\nmeans of live/dead and dead/live comparisons among\nthe biocoenoses and thanatocoenoses found in channels\nwith distinct morphologies and bottom types; and (c)\nthe percentage of dead individuals from species found\nalive.\n\nMATERIAL  AND  METHODS\n\nThe Touro Passo River is a tributary of the left\nmargin of the Uruguay River basin, located in Uruguaiana\nCounty, State of Rio Grande do Sul (Fig. 1). Its springs\nare located 140 meters above sea-level, changing to 60 m\nin the mid course and to 40 m in the river\u2019s mouth (BOMBIN,\n1976). Floodings are frequent and are, in part, caused by\nfloods of the Uruguay River or are a consequence of\ntorrential rains. Also, these may be caused by the low\ncapacity of the hydrological system, with the river\noverruning all the flood plains (BOMBIN, 1976).\n\nThe course of the Touro Passo River shows a varied\nof morphologies, including straight and meandering to\nbraided sectors. Hence, the river includes several fluvial\nsubenvironments, supporting different types of\nfreshwater communities. The channels have a great range\nof depth and their margins are covered by riparian\nvegetation (BOMBIN, 1976). Sandy bottoms predominate,\nand aquatic plants are rare (Tab. I).\n\nIn the studied sectors, the Touro Passo River is a\nforth-order river (see STRAHLER &amp; STRAHLER, 1989), which\nsupposedly favour the deposition of great amount of\nlive materials and dead skeletal remains (see\nCHRISTOFOLETTI, 1980).\n\nThe climate of the region is subtropical, type Cfa\nII2a (K\u00f6ppen\u2019s classification, MORENO, 1961). The mean\nannual precipitation value is 1350 mm, with rains equally\ndistributed during the year. The mean annual temperature\nis 19\u00b0C (maximum averages of 26\u00b0C, in January, and\nminimum averages of 12\u00baC, in July), with the humidity\nreaching 70% (SARTORI, 2003).\n\nThe area is represented by the grasslands (locally\nnamed Campanha), with stony fields and shallow soils\n(PORTO, 2002). The vegetation includes deciduous woody,\ngenerally thorny, including arboreal/shrub species, as the\n\u201c espinilho\u201d [Acacia farnesiana (L.)] (Fabaceae), and wild\nand succulent plants, showing grassy/herbaceous\ncoverings, typical of subtropical areas (BOMBIN, 1976;\nLEITE, 2002; PORTO, 2002).\n\nSamplings were carried out in two different river\nsectors, with distinct channel morphologies: straight (SS)\n\n\n\n455\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9r. Zool., Porto Alegre, 96(4):453-465, 30 de dezembro de 2006\n\nQuantitative fidelity of Recent freshwater mollusk assemblages...\n\nand meandering-sectors (MS), both located in the mid-\ncourse of the Touro Passo River (Fig. 1). We also sampled\na partially dammed channel. There an artificial dam was\nbuilt to supply water to local agricultural activities, during\nthe dry seasons. Thus, during the water-deficienty periods\nthe channel looses connection with the main river channel,\nacting as an abandoned meander channel (AMS) (Fig. 1).\n\nThe collecting stations in the SS include two sites,\nboth with low sinuosity. Although sandy bottoms\npredominate, fine-grained (muddy) compacted substrates\nare also present (\u00c9dson Oliveira, pers. comm.). In some\nsites, the margins show steep slope and the channel\nreaches nearly 1.60 m of depth. The current velocities range\nfrom moderate to strong with continuous flow (Tab. I).\n\nThe collecting station in the MS is located in the\nmeandering to braided sector of the river (BOMBIN, 1976)\n(Fig. 1). Small and shallow channels, some with braided\npattern, occur in the alluvial island that separates the\nmain channel from the secondary one (Fig. 1). The island\nis characterized by the presence of riparian vegetation,\noffering little shadowing for the river\u2019s margins. Physical\nand hydrological properties of each channel are very\ndistinct (Tab. I).\n\nSampling in the MS included five substations for\neach station (Fig. 1). The molluscan fauna of the AMS\nwas sampled to record possible out-of-habitat species\nthat were transported during floods. The vegetation of\nthe AMS is characterized by riparian coverage and by\nthe presence of the aquatic macrophyte Nymphoides\nindica (L.) O. Kuntze (Menyanthaceae). The site is\ncharacterized by low luminosity, less than 60 cm of depth,\nand organic-rich bottoms.\n\nThe biocoenoses (life assemblages) and\nthanatocoenoses (death assemblages) were sampled in\nFebruary (dry period) and May (flood period) of 2003, and\nin April (dry period) of 2004. In the MS, samplings were\nconducted only during the dry season. During the May\nfloodings the water level rises and associated with the strong\ncurrents made impossible the sampling of the MS bottoms,\ndue to the steep margins of this sector. It is important to\nemphasize that in the SS sector the oscilation of the water\nlevel is smaller than in the MS, and the shells were captured\nat the same sites during the flood and dry periods.\n\nIn each substation (SS 01 to 05 and MS 01 to 05),\nthe mollusks were collected using quadrats with sampling\narea of 5 m2. This area is adequate to the low abundance\nof freshwater mollusks, such as Unionacea (CUMMINS,\n1994). Consequently, an area of 25 m\n\n2\n was sampled for\n\neach station. In the AMS, samplings included three\nquadrats only.\n\nThe mollusks were collected with sieves (mesh of 1\nmm) especially in the river\u2019s margins, not overstepping 1\nm of depth. In the AMS, the macrophytes were removed\nand examined individually, and the mollusks were handly\ncollected. In the substation MS 02, adjacent to a\nfossiliferous outcrop of the Touro Passo Formation, the\nfossil mollusks, whenever identified, were removed of\nthe sampling.\n\nLive-collected specimens were preserved in 80%\nethyl alcohol, and the dead ones stored in plastic bags.\nThe specimens (shell fragments included), were identified\nto species level, whenever possible.\n\nTaxonomic identification was conducted using the\nextensive malacological literature available and with help\n\nFig. 1.

The studied mollusks were deposited in\nthe \u201c Cole\u00e7\u00e3o de Invertebrados, Setor de Zoologia,\nDepartamento de Biologia, Universidade Federal de Santa\nMaria (UFSM)\u201d.\n\nFor each mollusk assemblage, analyses included\n(a) the number (n) of individuals, (b) the relative frequency\n(%), and (c) the numeric dominance (the numerically\ndominant species in each site sampled).\n\nTo determine the number of bivalves in the death\nassemblages, for each station, the disarticulated matching\nvalves (right/left) were considered as one individual.\nAccording to KOWALEWSKI et al. (2003) \u201c although all valves\n(including fragments) may represent unique individuals\nwhen the sampling domain is large, some correction for\ndisarticulated elements still needs to be applied when\nbivalved organisms are analyzed together with univalved\norganisms. This is because univalved specimens are half\nas likely to be sampled as bivalved organisms\u201d.\nConsequently, the number of disarticulated valves, with\nno matching valves, was corrected by a factor of 0.5 (see\nKOWALEWSKI et al., 2003 for this methodological procedure).\nBecause shell fragments were extremely rare, exhaustive\nanalyses were not employed (KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003).\n\nSpecies diversity and richness were calculated for\nthe evaluation and comparison of diversity of each\nstudied station. The richness (S) was measured,\naccording to the number of different species in each\nstation. The diversity index applied was the Shannon-\nWiener (H\u2019 = - ? p\n\ni\n . log\n\ne\n p\n\ni\n) index, where p\n\ni\n is the\n\nproportion of individuals found in the n species\n(MAGURRAN, 1988).\n\nThe analysis of the ecological fidelity of the\nbiocoenoses (i.e., the intensity in which each species is\nassociated with the biocoenoses) followed the Dajoz\u2019s\nclassification (DAJOZ, 1978). According to this, the\nfollowing species are present: (a) characteristic species\n(eucoen) \u2013  exclusively occurs in one biocoenosis or is\ncommonly abundant in certain associations; (b)\npreferential species (tychocoen) \u2013  occurs in several\nbiocoenoses, but showing preference for one of them;\n(c) strange (xenoecic) \u2013  accidentally occurs in the\nbiocoenoses and, (d) indifferent species \u2013  indifferently\noccurs in several biocoenoses.\n\nThe Sorensen index of similarity was used to\ncompare the species composition of the life and death\nassemblages, in terms of the number of species present\n\nTable I.

In the MS site, 66.6% of species found alive were\nalso found dead (F1), and 61.5% of the dead ones were\nrecorded alive (F2) (Tab. IV). The similarity of these values\nis probably related to the same richness observed (S=11)\nfor both assemblages (Tabs. II, III). It is important to\nemphasize here that the assemblages found in the MS\nsite showed significantly higher fidelity (p=0.012) than\n\nthe assemblages of the SS site. For example, nine species\n(P. canaliculata, P. aff. orbigny, Potamolithus sp.,\nBiomphalaria sp., D. delodontus wymani, C. fluminea,\nC. largillierti, E. klappenbachi and P. sterkianum) found\ndead in the assemblages of the meandering-sector were\nalso recorded in the live assemblages (F2).

The similarity\namong the live/dead fidelities (F1) of both sectors was\nnot significantly different (p=0.911).\n\nAmong the bivalve species found by BOMBIN (1976)\nand \u00c9dson Oliveira (pers. comm.) for the Touro Passo\nRiver, some were not recorded in the studied life\nassemblages, including: Leila blainvilliana (Lea, 1834),\nDiplodon variabilis (Maton, 1811), D. parallelopipedon,\nD. rhuacoicus (Orbigny, 1835), Castalia ambigua inflata\n(Orbigny, 1835), A. tenebricosus, A. ferrarisi (Orbigny,\n1835), A. patagonicus, A. trapezeus (Spix, 1827),\nMycetopoda legumen (Martens, 1888), M. siliquosa, M.\nminuana and Monocondylaea corrientesensis (Orbigny,\n1835). However, some of them (D. delodontus wymani,\nD. parallelopipedon, C. fluminea, N. limosa) were\nassigned in the studied death assemblages. Yet, it is\nnoteworthy that some bivalve species in the studied\nmolluscan fauna (e.g., A. ferrarisi, A. trapesialis\nforbesianus, L. blainvilliana, M. legumen and M.\nsiliquosa) are declining or even disappearing (MANSUR\net al., 2003a), due to human induced environmental\nchanges and/or due to competition with alien species [C.\nfluminea and Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857)] (MANSUR\n&amp; VEITENHEIMER-MENDES, 1976; MANSUR et al., 2003b).\n\nThe low levels of richness observed may be a result\nof the short extension of the Touro Passo River (~55 km),\nand the typical water volume oscillation along the seasons\n(BOMBIN, 1976). This may generate adverse environmental\nconditions to some species.\n\nAs far as the ecological fidelity, the presence of a\nhigh number of species classified as preferential is an\nunexpected characteristic of the studied life assemblages.\nThis is because freshwater mollusks are usually\nconsidered generalists (DUARTE &amp; DIEFENBACH, 1994;\nMANSUR et al., 1994; PEREIRA et al., 2000a), and thus not\nrestricted to a particular fluvial environment. The unique\n\nstrange species found (Biomphalaria sp.) is a\nrepresentative of a genus whose species are common in\na wide variety of lentic environments. Species of\nBiomphalaria are especially common in settings\ncharacterized by slow current and marked by\nanthropogenic influence (PEREIRA et al., 2000b). The shells\nof Biomphalaria sp. might have been carried out into\nthe river from vicinal lentic settings (e.g., AMS), during\nfloodings. Similar lateral shell transport was already\nrecorded for this genus by CHIEFFI &amp; MORETTI (1979). The\nspecies classified as indifferent (P. canaliculata) inhabits\nlotic and lentic environments, and also shows a wide\nenvironmental distribution. This species can cope with\nthe dry conditions among seasons, and eutrophic\nconditions (CAZZANIGA, 1987; ESTEBENET &amp; CAZZANIGA,\n1992; MART\u00cdN et al., 2001; PEREIRA et al., 2000a, 2001).\nThe presence of a large number of species assigned as\npreferentials indicates the high ecological fidelity of the\nbiocoenosis of the Touro Passo River.\n\nAmong the three species recorded in the AMS site,\nthe dominant species (G. moricandi), and also\nBiomphalaria sp., are commonly associated with aquatic\nvegetation (BONETTO et al., 1982; SANTOS &amp; FREITAS, 1986;\nLANZER, 1996; PEREIRA et al., 2000a,b). Therefore,\nenvironments such as the abandoned meander could be\na favorable place to species assigned as strange or\nindifferent to thrive. These settings could also act as a\nplace to shell dispersion to other nearby environments\nas well.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the taxonomic\ncomposition of the studied molluscan assemblages is not\nthe one expected for a fourth-order river. In such rivers,\naccording to the River Continumm Concept, the richness\nand abundance of scrapers/grazers (gastropod) and\ncollectors (bivalve) species are expected to be similar\n(ALLAN, 1996; NAIMAN &amp; BILBY, 1998). In general, the\npredominance of the latter suggests the presence of large\nsections and/or the proximity of the river\u2019s mouth (NAIMAN\n&amp; BILBY, 1998).\n\nAt the station-level, the higher richness and\nabundance showed by the substations of the MS site,\nalthough not significantly different (see results), seems\na reflection of the higher habitat diversity of this river\nsector. This includes settings with different bottom types,\nvariable current velocities (lentic and lotic facies) and\nthe ephemerous presence of isolated water pools. Also,\nthe higher Shannon-Wiener index obtained (Tab. IV)\nsuggests that the MS life assemblages are more\nhomogeneous, regarding the species frequency.\n\nIn general, the species P. aff. orbigny, Potamolithus\nsp. and C. largillierti were dominant in the MS life\nassemblages and in the whole Touro Passo River as well.\nThe substations MS02, MS04 and MS05 showed,\nsimultaneously, the three species, reinforcing their\necological preference for sites with coarse sands, shallow\nwater conditions with intermitent water flows (ITUARTE,\n1994; L\u00d3 PEZ ARMENGOL &amp; DARRIGRAN, 1998). In the\nstraight-sector, only one species (P. aff. orbigny) is\ndominant. This was recorded in the substations SS01,\nSS02 and SS03, where silt-dominated bottoms (sometimes\nwith coarse to fine sands), no aquatic plants, and strong\nand continuous currents prevail (Tab. I). These\n\nTable IV.

II,\nIII). In fact, both share nine species at river-scale, differing\nonly by the presence of the utmost four species (Heleobia\naff. bertoniana, D. parallelopipedon, M. siliquosa and\nN. limosa). The abundance of the thanatocoenoses was\nalso lower than that already reported in the literature.\nThis may reflect the differences in the sedimentary regime\nof the studied freshwater environments. Due to the\ndifferences in the sedimentary processes (e.g., net\nsedimentation rate) shell accumulation rates in freshwater\nenvironments are usually lower than in the shelf marine\nenvironments (PETERSON, 1976; COHEN, 1989; BRIGGS et\nal., 1990; WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp;\nFLESSA, 1995).\n\nStudy in reservoirs, east-central Ohio, USA (see\nCUMMINS, 1994), showed that death and life assemblages\nof Unionacea exhibit high ranges of rank order correlation\n(rs=-0.06 to 0.57), especially to the non-regulated courses.\nOn the other hand, the regulated ones showed lower\nranges, but with positive and high values at site-scale\n(rs=0.67 a 0.89, CUMMINS, 1994). These differences are\ninterpreted as response to the water energy, particularly\nto the low-energy conditions that prevails in the\nreservoirs (CUMMINS, 1994). At river-scale, the rank order\n\ncorrelation recorded by CUMMINS (1994) was rs=0.64.\nSimilarly, the rank order correlation recorded to the Touro\nPasso River was rs=0.56. Hence, despite of the unexpected\nvalues of the richness and abundance of the studied\ndeath assemblages, the ranking of dominance was similar\nto that previously recorded in the literature for other\nfreshwater shelly thanatocoenoses (WARREN, 1991;\nCUMMINS, 1994). Additionally, our data also show that\namong the six dominant species (Potamolithus sp., P. aff.\norbigny, C. largillierti, Biomphalaria sp., C. fluminea\nand P. canaliculata) of the thanatocoenoses of the Touro\nPasso River, five (the exception is Biomphalaria sp.) are\nalso dominants in the biocoenoses. Corbicula largillierti\nshows the third order position in both assemblages. This\nis in accordance with the general idea that the ranking of\ndominance at river-scale is preserved in the\nthanatocoenosis.\n\nThe index of similarity among the live and death\nassemblages of the Touro Passo River was high (0.72),\nand similar to that observed by CUMMINS (1994) for the\nnon-regulated areas of Ohio reservoirs (0.67 to 0.70). In\nthe Touro Passo River, the recorded indexes for each\ncollecting stations were 0.50 (SS) and 0.73 (MS), ranging\nfrom 0.28 (SS01) to 0.90 (MS02) among the substations\n(Tab. IV). At station-level, the differences are probably\nrelated to the less energetic conditions that prevail in the\nmeandering-sector. At substation-level, the differences\nmight be associated with particular local conditions (e.g.,\nmargin declivity, bottom type and the presence/ausence\nof terrestrial and aquatic plants) (see also BRIGGS et al.,\n1990). Consequently, despite of the discontinuous\ndistribution of the species in the sampled death\nassemblages from the SS and MS sectors, the\nthanatocoenoses yielded nearly similar abundance and\nrichness with the local life assemblages.\n\nFigs. 14-19.

Zool., Porto Alegre, 96(4):453-465, 30 de dezembro de 2006\n\nQuantitative fidelity of Recent freshwater mollusk assemblages...\n\nOur fidelity (F1, F2) results (Tab. IV), at river-scale,\nare somewhat distinct of those previously reported in\nthe literature. For example, CUMMINS (1994) obtained F1\nand F2 values of 83% to 100%, and of 50% to 58%,\nrespectively for freshwater assemblages of US-reservoirs.\nOther authors (KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA, 1995) noted that, as\ngeneral condition, assemblages generated under\nfreshwater environments yield the following values: F1\n(=95%), and F2 (=55%). Assemblages of the Touro Passo\nRiver, yielded F1 values as low as 60%, and F2 values\n(=47.3%), nearly comparable with those previously\nreported by CUMMINS (1994) and KIDWELL &amp; FLESSA (1995).\nHowever, it should be stressed that the slightly low F1\nand F2 values noted here may be due to the adoption of\ndistinct methodological decisions among studies,\nincluding exhaustive analyses, which include fragments\n(BRIGGS et al., 1990; CUMMINS, 1994; KOWALEWSKI et al.,\n2003), and the use of target taxa, especially among bivalve\nmollusks (Unionacea) (WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS, 1994).\nBesides this, it should be also remembered that the\nsedimentary environments are not the same for all those\nstudies. Hence, the differences may reflect the distinct\nsedimentary/taphonomic processes that operate in each\nenvironment (see also PIP, 1988; BRIGGS et al., 1990). On\nthe other hand, the low number of species found alive\nthat are also found dead (F1), can be attributed to the\nfactors that may control the abundance and/or the\ntemporal- and spatial-mixing of the shells. These include\nthe downstream drifting and the fast dissolution of the\nshells under freshwater conditions (COHEN, 1989; BRIGGS\net al., 1990; WARREN, 1991). However, it is also important\nto emphasize that the numerically dominant species are\nmore easily recorded than the others, as indicated by the\nSpearman rank correlation and F3 values (Tab. IV).\n\nAt station-scale, the higher percentages of dead\nspecies also found in the life assemblages (F2) and the\nnumber of dead individuals representing species also\nfound alive (F3) recorded in the MS site could be\nassociated with the continuous downstream flow, from\nthe straight-sector, that probably transports the shells,\nand with the physical properties prevailing in the\nmeandering-sector. In the latter, the presence of coarse\nbottoms and riparian vegetation (Tab. I) may provide\nstable conditions, allowing the trapping of the shells,\nfavoring its accumulation (see BRIGGS et al., 1990, for a\nsimilar example).\n\nAt river-scale, 72% of the dead individuals\nrepresented species found alive (F3), while at substation-\nscale, F3 values range from 29.2% to 87.6%. These results\nare in the range of the data available in the literature. For\nexample, CUMMINS (1994) reported F3 values ranging from\n58% to 97% to the non-regulated streams of the North\nAmerica reservoirs. KIDWELL &amp; BOSENCE (1991) assigned\nF3 values ranging from 70% to 90% for assemblages\ngenerated in marine environments.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe taxonomic composition of the analyzed\nmolluscan biocoenoses of the Touro Passo River is\ncharacteristic of the lotic settings that prevail in the study\narea. However, it does not reflect the river-order, and is\n\nnot consistent with the River Continuum Concept.\nEcological attributes (abundance, richness and\n\ndiversity) of the studied biocoenoses are not sensitive\nto particular environmental conditions (e.g., channel\nmorphology). However, they may reflect the complex\ninteraction among the natural factors, including the\npresence/absence of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation,\ndifferences in current velocity and bottom type of the\ndifferent studied river-sectors.\n\nThe rank order of the dominant species of the Touro\nPasso River in the thanatocoenoses could be used to\ninfer the ranking of the most abundant species in the\noriginal life assemblages.\n\nThe low number of species found alive that were\nalso found dead (F1) in the studied assemblages may be\na result of the lotic environmental conditions prevailing\nin the Touro Passo River. This may favor quick shell\ndissolution, avoiding the accumulation of the non-\ncontemporaneous remains. Hence, rates of time-averaging\nmay be low for those assemblages.\n\nThe low values of dead/live agreement reported\nhere are quite similar to that already published in the\nfreshwater molluscan literature. Hence, the studied death\nassemblages are not faithful mirrors of the original\nbiocoenoses. However, the number of dead individuals\nthat are also found alive (F3) is high. Consequently, this\nmay be a useful tool in the reconstruction of some\nparticular attributes of the original biocoenoses (e.g., the\ndominant species and their ranking order).\n\nAcknowledgments .
