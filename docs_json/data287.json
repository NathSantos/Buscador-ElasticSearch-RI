Nitrogen is being used as a replacement for natural gas injection to increase the recovery from oil, condensate and gas reservoirs. Pure dry cryogenic nitrogen can now be obtained from air separation plants at the oilfield site. Nitrogen from this source, delivered at high pressure, may cost less than one dollar per thousand cubic feet. One cubic foot of natural gas can produce about eight cubic feet of nitrogen.\nCarbon dioxide gas has been replacing the ethane, propane and butane hydrocarbons normally required to miscible displacement in enhanced oil recovery programs. This gas works at low pressures of 1,000 to 3,000 psi, and its cost represents only a small fraction of the cost of the ethane, propane or butane, normally used in this type of application, and an important saving of hydrocarbons. To reduce costs, carbon dioxide slugs pushed by nitrogen are also being used.\nCrude oil has been burned to obtain the steam required for the production of the heavy oils of low API gravity. As this production is expensive and requires the combustion of one-third of the oil produced, plans are now being made to replace the oil fired steam plants with coal-fired steam plants. This will save the liquid hydrocarbons.\nAir injection is also being used both as trial, for pressure maintenance, and in a continuous basis, for in situ combustion to produce heavy oils. Pure oxygen is now also being tried in the field on two in situ combustion projects.\n(Originais recebidos em 25-X-84.)\n1 - INTRODUCTION\nThis paper will show methods of saving valuable hydrocarbon fluids in practicing enhanced oil and gas recovery. In addition it will indicate the costs and show the type of fluids which are now being used to save the scarce hydrocarbon fluids which have been used previously when practicing\nsecondary and tertiary oil recovery methods.\n2 - NITROGEN REPLACES NATURAL GAS\nOne of the topics which will be addressed relates to the substitution of nitrogen for natural gas injection into reservoirs of almost all types in which\nnatural gas has been injected previously. This method of oil recovery results in very substantial savings in our scarce and valuable natural gas. Nitrogen for injection comes from cryogenic air separation plants which are located at the site of the reservoir. The cryogenic plant will take in air and cool the air down to approximately \u2014 300\u00b0F, where it liquefies and becomes somewhat like water. The pure nitrogen is boiled off; the cold nitrogen is warmed, compressed to several thousand pounds pressure and injected underground into the reservoir. See figure 1 for sketch of the process.\n3\t- NITROGEN FROM AIR\nSEPARATION PLANTS\nNitrogen plants may be designed for capacities of less than one million cubic feet to more than 100 million cubic feet per day. Nitrogen plants may be powered by electricity, by natural gas or diesel oil. It is of interest to note that if natural gas is used as a fuel a nitrogen plant will produce of the order of 6 to 10 cu. ft. of nitrogen per cu. ft. of natural gas burned, so there can be quite a saving in hydrocarbons by generating nitrogen even when natural gas is used for fuel.\n4\t- COST OF NITROGEN\nWhen the use of nitrogen was first announced a few years ago nitrogen costs were very nominal. If you needed approximately 10 to 15 million std cu. ft. of nitrogen per day delivered at 3,000 to 6,000 psi the total cost of nitrogen at that time was of the order of 60c! per mcf delivered at high pressure, and this included the electrical power cost. Approximately 30cf mcf of this cost is devoted to amortization of the plant and the other 30^/mcf is devoted to electrical power cost. Since that time there has been inflation and an increase in the electrical power cost, but still the costs of nitrogen will be of the order of 80 cents to $1.00 per mcf for ten to fifteen million cubic feet per day based on current costs. This cost may be compared with natural gas costs which will be several times that of nitrogen. In parts of our state the average natural gas price is near $2.75 an mcf, but we also have natural gas at over $7.00 an mcf, so, it is easy to see that there can be a great monetary saving between nitrogen and natural gas. In addition, natural gas is not available in many areas, so nitrogen is selected.\nNITROGEN\nHIGH PRESSURE NITROGEN\nHIGH PRESSURE\nNITROGEN INJECTION\nAIR SEPARATION PLANT\nRESERVOIR OIL\nFig. 1 - This figure shows an artist's sketch of the use of nitrogen to replace natural gas for enhanced recovery. The nitrogen is obtained from the air in an air separation plant. The nitrogen is warmed and compressed to the required reservoir pressure.\n5\t- EFFECT OF PRESSURE ON OIL RECOVERY\nIn conducting our early laboratory work we studied the effect of pressure on oil recovery by high pressure nitrogen injection. Some of our early studies were made at temperatures of approximately 250\u00b0F. We studied an oil of approximately 54.4\u00b0 API gravity, with a gas-oil ratio of approximately 700 cu. ft. per barrel of oil.\nWe operate two sand packs in the laboratory: one sand pack is 40 feet long; the second sand pack is 100 ft long. In some early displacement tests we found that when using nitrogen at a pressure of approximately 2,500 psi the oil recovery was only approximately 56 percent of the oil-in-place. By increasing the pressure to 3,000 psi, the oil recovery increased to 68 percent of the oil-in-place. On increasing the nitrogen\npressure to approximately 4,000 psi we recovered approximately 86 percent of the oil-in-place. We then increased the pressure to approximately 5,000 psi and obtained a recovery of more than 90 percent of the oil-in-place. The high oil recovery is indicative of miscibility and .shows the possible benefits which may be obtained when injecting nitrogen into some oil reservoirs. The results are shown in figure 2. This process of miscible displacement of oil by nitrogen injection is now being initiated in the U.S.\n6\t- USE OF NITROGEN FOR\nVOLATILE OIL DISPLACEMENT\nHistorically, volatile oils have been displaced using this pressure natural gas. Volatile oils are intermediate between condensate fluids and the usual black oil systems. Nitrogen has been used to\nPRESSURE PSI (1,000'S)\nFig. 2 - This figure shows the effect of pressure on oil recovery by high pressure nitrogen injection. It is seen that the oil recovery was more than 90% of the original oil-in-place as the nitrogen pressure reached 5 000 psi. From work by Rushing, Thomasson, Reynolds and Crawford.\n9 - SUBSTITUTE FLUIDS FOR ETHANE, PROPANE AND BUTANE FOR OIL RECOVERY\nThe price of ethane, propane and butane has increased so greatly that it is vitally important that substitute fluids be developed. Carbon dioxide has been studied and is now being used to replace ethane, propane and butane for miscible displacement of oil. If one injects carbon dioxide into an oil sand at pressures of the order of 2,000 to 3,000 psi, it will be found that many crudes may be displaced miscibly by the carbon dioxide. When miscible displacement occurs, \u2019\u25a0he oil recovery becomes greater than 90% of the oil-in-place. We have observed this high oil recovery in long sand packs in the laboratory. Carbon dioxide for this purpose may come from natural carbon dioxide deposits underground. Carbon dioxide may come from chemical plants, or it may be extracted from the flue gas from power plants or other plants which burn coal or hydrocarbons.\nstudy the oil recovery for a volatile oil system. It was found that after injecting approximately thirty percent of a hydrocarbon pore volume of nitrogen approximately thirty percent of the volatile oil was produced. After injecting approximately 60 percent of a pore volume of nitrogen approximately 60 percent of the oil was produced. On injecting 1.2 to 1.4 pore volumes of nitrogen the volatile oil recovery was of the order of 92 to 98% of the original oil-in-place. There was a slight difference in the oil recovery using natural gas, but the difference was fairly small.\n7\t- USE OF NITROGEN IN CONDENSATE RESERVOIRS\nNitrogen has also been studied for its possible use to displace condensate fluids. Nitrogen was compared with natural gas for this purpose. The condensate fluid had a temperature near 150\u00b0F, and a dewpoint of approximately 3,200 psi. Tests were made injecting both nitrogen and a natural gas above the dewpoint. The natural gas was composed of approximately 95 percent methane and five percent ethane. It was learned that when 40 percent of a hydrocarbon pore volume of either natural gas or nitrogen was injected, approximately 40 percent of the pore volume of condensate fluid would be produced. At 80 percent injection of\neither nitrogen or natural gas the oil recovery was approximately 80 percent of the condensate fluid in place.\nBy the time one displaceable pore volume of gas was injected, regardless of whether the gas was nitrogen or natural gas, one would recover almost 100 percent of the condensate fluid present. Large volumes of nitrogen are now being injected into condensate wells to displace the condensate fluids. The nitrogen is replacing natural gas for this application. The natural gas is available for sale providing immediate income.\n8\t- NITROGEN CLEAN-UP\nEventually the injected nitrogen will break through at a nearby producing well. Once the nitrogen does break through and reach a certain level the nitrogen must be removed from the \u2014 natural gas. The technology is available for nitrogen removal. A nitrogen rejection plant is very similar to a natural gas plant, with the exception that a nitrogen separation column must be added to the gasoline plant. In addition the CO2 and hydrogen sulfide must be removed. Where the nitrogen rejection project is designed from the beginning it adds only a nominal cost to increase the gasoline plant design to handle the nitrogen.\nwork\nwe first\nIn our laboratory reported on oils of approximately 45\u00b0 API gravity at a reservoir temperature of approximately 105\u00b0F. When the pressure was of the order of 600 to\n1,000 psi the oil recovery was approximately 60 percent of the\noil-in-place. However, as we increased\nthe pressure in the laboratory up to approximately 1,200 psi we obtained an oil recovery of the order of 88\npercent and by increasing the pressure to 1,400 psi we achieved an oil recovery of over 93% of the oil-in-place. This is shown in figure 3. We have made studies on quite a number of crudes, and the same general phenomena have occurred. This means that carbon\ndioxide can be used for miscible\ndisplacement of crude oils in much the same manner as ethane, propane and butane. Many oil reservoirs in the U.S. are now being prepared for oil recovery by the use of carbon dioxide.\n10- COST OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWhen we first started our work using CO2, the cost of CO2 was approximately $1.25 per mcf. You must realize there is a price range. If you could find a low price source of CO2 near your oil field you might get a price of only 35 to 50 cents an mcf. But, if you must truck in liquid carbon dioxide the price would be of the order\nFig. 3- This figure shows the oil recovery by injecting carbon dioxide at various pressures. Note that the oil recovery was greater than 90% when the carbon dioxide pressure approached 1400 psi. From work by O'Leary, Murray, Guillory, greive, Reece, Nugent, Perkins and Crawford.\nof $3.50 per mcf. For large sources of CO2 which must be piped in a few hundred miles the cost is now approximately $1.75 per mcf of CO2. By contrast the cost of nitrogen from air separation plants will be approximately half the cost of CO2.\nIn addition to costing half the CO cost, when one looks at th compressibility factors of nitrogen and CO2 one finds that the compressibility factor of nitrogen may be greater than 2.0, perhaps 1.05 to 1.1. By contrast the compressibility factor of CO2 at a temperature of 105\u00b0F and near 1,500 psi may be only 0.35 or even less. This means that one mcf of nitrogen can easily occupy the volume of three mcf of CO2. Stated conversely, itwill require only one-third as much nitrogen to occupy the same reservoir space as it does CO2. For this reason, for many applications the cost of nitrogen may be only about 15% of the cost of CO2 for the same reservoir volumes.\nNITROGEN\nCARBON DIOXIDE SLUGS PUSHED BY NITROGEN\n11- CARBON DIOXIDE SLUGS PUSHED BY NITROGEN\nCARBON DIOXIDE SLUG\nI\n0\n\u2666\n\u2666\nNITROGEN\n\u2666\n\u2666\nCARBON\nDIOXIDE \u2019\u00e8\nSLUG \u25ba&lt;\noil of approximately 34\u00b0API gravity. The reservoir temperature was 107\u00b0F, and we used a stock tank oil. There was no gas in solution. Our core length was 100 feet long. All CO2 slugs were pushed by nitrogen. In our first tests we used a CO2 slug of approximately 25% of the hydrocarbon pore volume. The slug was pushed by nitrogen. The oil recovery for this crude was of the order of 98% of the oil initially in place. We reduced the CO2 slug size down to 10% of the hydrocarbon pore volume, and we found that the oil recovery was of the order of 97% of the oil-in-place. We reduced the slug size down to 5% and obtained an oil recovery of approximately 90% of the oil-in-place. By using a slug of only 2.5 to 3.0 percent we obtained an oil recovery of over 80%. Without CO2 we obtained an oil recovery close to 60% of the oil-in-place. The above results were\nWe have made many studies on the use of carbon dioxide slugs pushed by nitrogen. See figure 4.

By using a ten percent slug of CO2 pushed by nitrogen we obtained an ultimate oil recovery of approximately 99% of the oil-in-place. By using a five percent slug of CO2 pushed by nitrogen we obtained a recovery of approximately 97% of the oil-in-place. These results occurred at the higher pressure of 1,850 psi, compared to the previous results which occurred at 1,250 psi.\n12-\tSUMMARY\nIt has become vitally important that enhanced oil recovery methods be developed which would save our scarce and valuable hydrocarbons.\nFrom a study on the use of nitrogen it would appear that nitrogen will be used in condensate reservoirs, for miscible displacement of some crude oil systems, for volatile oil systems, for injection into ' gas caps, for pressure maintenance, for attic oil recovery, for secondary recovery of gas and in addition as a pusher gas for miscible slugs. I^jtrogen will also be used in gas reservoirs having a water drive.\nFor the medium API gravity oils it appears that carbon dioxide will be used as a substitute for ethane, propane and butane to achieve miscibility of those oils. The carbon dioxide may be used as a slug pushed by nitrogen. Coal will likely be used as a fuel to replace the use of crude oil as fuel when generating steam for steam driven oil recovery processes.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nGreive, C. et alii.
