No entanto, este tipo de imagens sa?o desenvolvidas e op-\ntimizadas para o ce?rebro adulto que se sabe ter tempos de relaxac?a?o difer-\nentes daqueles presentes no ce?rebro de um rece?m-nascido. Esta diferenc?a e?\ninerente ao alto teor em a?gua presente no ce?rebro de um rece?m-nascido. O\nprincipal objectivo deste projecto e? enta?o proceder a? optimizac?a?o de te?cnicas\navanc?adas de RM como susceptibilidade magne?tica (SWI) e de quantificac?a?o\ndos tempo de relaxac?a?o (DESPOT1 e DESPOT2) para o ce?rebro de rece?m-\nnascidos.\n\nO sinal de RM e? medido sob a forma de um nu?mero complexo caracteri-\nzado por uma intensidade e uma fase. Normalmente em RM, o sinal de fase\ne? ignorado e apenas a intensidade do sinal e? utilizada para proceder a? recon-\nstruc?a?o das imagens. No entanto, a fase do sinal complexo e? extremamente\nrica em informac?a?o relativa a?s diferenc?as de susceptibilidade entre tecidos\ndiferentes, sendo por isso bastante u?til para realc?ar este tipo de contraste.\nUma das questo?es que dificulta a utilizac?a?o das imagens de fase e? o facto\nde apenas poderem registar valores no intervalo de [??,?) o que resulta no\nmapeamento de valores que caiam fora desse intervalo para o seu interior.\nUma vez que a informac?a?o de interesse nas imagens de fase corresponde a\nestruturas de pequena dimensa?o, caracterizadas por freque?ncias elevadas no\nespac?o de Fourier, SWI consiste na utilizac?a?o de imagens de fase sujeitas a\num filtro passa-alto simples (janela rectangular. Tal permite extra??r a in-\nformac?a?o de interesse, que posteriormente e? utilizada para realc?ar contraste\nde susceptibilidade em imagens de intensidade. Este mapeamento da in-\nformac?a?o de susceptibilidade na imagem de intensidade e? realizado atrave?s\nda multiplicac?a?o da mesma por uma ma?scara extra??da da imagem de fase\nfiltrada para as baixas freque?ncias. Isto tem um particular interesse para a\nvisualizac?a?o do sistema vascular venoso uma vez que diferenc?as de suscep-\ntibilidade entre sangue venoso e os tecidos envolventes permitem identificar\nestruturas venosas mesmo em vasos com dimenso?es inferiores a? resoluc?a?o de\naquisic?a?o. Isto e? possivel grac?as a?s propriedades paramagne?ticas da deox-\n\ni\n\n\n\nihemoglobina presente no sangue venoso. Neste trabalho o protocolo nor-\nmalmente utilizado para SWI foi adpatado e implementado a? realidade dos\nrece?m-nascidos. Ao mesmo tempo foi tambe?m desenvolvida uma interface\ngra?fica de modo a facilitar o processamento e construc?a?o de imagens ponder-\nadas em susceptibilidade. Este processamento foi desenvolvido integrando\na FSL-FMRIB Software Library 5.0 juntamente com MatLab2012a. A in-\nterface gra?fica foi desenvolvida em ambiente de programac?a?o MatLab2012a\ncom o aux??lio da ferramenta guide. Uma pequena discussa?o sobre o efeito da\ndimensa?o do voxel de aquisia?o tambe?m e? inclu??da neste trabalho. E? pra?tica\ncomum os voxeis das imagens de SWI serem adquiridos com um quociente\nentre a resoluc?a?o do plano de visualizac?a?o e a espessura dos cortes (AR, do\ningle?s voxel aspect ratio) apresentar valores entre 2 e 4. No entanto, este\ntipo de aquisia?o induz uma excelente visualizac?a?o apenas para um dos (nor-\nmalmente o plano transversal) e uma muito ma? visualizac?a?o nos restantes\nplanos. Com isto em mente, resolveu-se tambe?m neste projecto, propo?r a\nutilizac?a?o de um voxel de aquisic?a?o isotro?pico em detrimento do que e? pra?tica\ncomum na literatura. Espera-se que este tipo de aquisic?a?o isotro?pica reduza\num pouco o contraste de susceptibilidade obtido, no entanto apo?s inspec?a?o\nvisual de algumas imagens obtidas em volunta?rios decidimos que o ganho em\ninformac?a?o nos dois restantes planos de visualizac?a?o ortogonais justificaria\nessa pequena perda de contraste. Este facto na?o foi no entanto devidamente\navaliado e mais estudos seriam necessa?rios para uma correcta avaliac?a?o desta\ncaracter??tica.\n\nNa segunda parte do projecto apresentado nesta tese, foi implementada\numa te?cnica de quantificac?a?o em RM conhecida por \u201cDriven Equilibrium\nSingle Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 - DESPOT1 e DESPOT2 \u201d. Esta\nte?cnica (neste trabalho referida como DESPOT) permite de forma bastante\nra?pida estimar T1 e T2. Mais uma vez, devido ao facto de o ce?rebro de rece?m-\nnascidos ter um conteu?do superior em a?gua relativamente ao ce?rebro adulto,\numa adaptac?a?o deve ser feita de modo a garantir a qualidade das imagens\nobtidas. Esta te?cnica consiste na utilizac?a?o de seque?ncias de RM conhecidas\ncomo Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) e Spoiled Gradient Echo (SPGR)\npara obter imagens mantendo todos os para?metros constantes, ao mesmo\ntempo que se variam os Flip Angles (FA). Isto permite ajustar um modelo\nmatema?tico que melhor explique as medic?o?es realizadas de modo a estimar\nos tempos de relaxac?a?o T1 e T2. Para garantir a precisa?o da estimac?a?o dos\npara?metros T1 e T2, simulac?o?es de Monte Carlo foram criadas onde se verifi-\ncou que, usando a ferramenta de MatLab2012a fminsearch, como algoritmo\nde optimizac?a?o e? poss??vel obter uma precisa?o de estimac?a?o (quociente entre\nvaria?ncia de estimac?a?o e o quadrado do valor correcto) de aproximadamente\n5% relativamente ao valor correcto. Uma avaliac?a?o da capacidade de estimar\nT1 e T2 foi realizada com modelos matema?ticos de um e dois compartimen-\ntos que procuram explicar o sinal de RM medido em DESPOT. O modelo\n\nii\n\n\n\nde dois compartimentos foi publicado por Deoni et al. em 2008, onde foi\nsugerido que e? poss??vel estimar as fracc?o?es relativas de cada um dos com-\npartimentos em cada voxel medido. No entanto, os resultados obtidos para\no modelo de dois compartimentos na?o foram satisfato?rios. Foi decidido que\numa avaliac?a?o mais profunda e tentativa de resoluc?a?o deste problema sa??a\nfora dos objectivos do projecto.\n\nO Cra?mer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) (em portugue?s limite inferior de\nCra?mer-Rao), e? uma ferramenta estat??stica que permite estimar qual a\nvaria?ncia min??ma alcanc?a?vel aquando da estimac?a?o de para?metros com base\nno ajuste de um modelo matema?tico a um conjunto de medic?o?es. De modo\na finalizar o trabalho apresentado nesta tese, propose?mo-nos a utilizar a\nminimizac?a?o do CRLB para seleccionar o conjunto de FA que permite es-\ntimar T1 e T2 com melhor precisa?o. Em primeiro lugar mostramos que a\nvaria?ncia prevista pelo CRLB se encontra em concorda?ncia com a varia?ncia\nobtida com as simulac?o?es de Monte Carlo. Isto permite confirmar a via-\nbilidade da utilizac?a?o do CRLB para optimizar o protocolo de estimac?a?o\nde T1 e T2. Para tal, foi desenvolvida uma func?a?o de custo utilizando o\nCRLB para optimizar o conjunto de FA que minimiza e garante a melhor\nprecisa?o considerando de uma matriz de combinac?o?es de T1 e T2. A func?a?o\nde custo consiste em minimizar o maior valor de precisa?o (definida como o\nquociente entre a varia?ncia e o quadrado do valor correcto para o para?metro)\ne? calculada numa grelha de combinac?o?es de para?metros T1 e T2, garantindo\nassim, que a cada iterac?a?o do processo de optimizac?a?o o pior cena?rio era\nminimizado. Os resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que e? poss??vel opti-\nmizar o protocolo de DESPOT garantindo uma precisa?o minima num grelha\nde combinc?o?es de diferentes T1 e T2. Foi tambe?m poss??vel concluir que se\npode reduzir significativamente o nu?mero de medic?o?es necessa?rias para a\nestimac?a?o sem aumentar significativamente a precisa?o desta. Este facto e? de\nextrema importa?ncia para obter imagens de RM em rece?m nascidos onde e?\nnecessa?rio reduzir o tanto quanto poss??vel os tempos de aquisic?a?o de modo\nevitar artefactos de movimento.\n\nAmbas as vertentes (SWI e DESPOT) deste projecto foram avaliadas\npela equipa te?cnica e esta?o aptas a serem incorporadas em ambiente cl??nico\npermitindo o desenvolvimento de futuros projectos nestas a?reas.\n\nPalavras-Chave: MRI, Optimizac?a?o, Estimac?a?o, SWI, DESPOT\n\niii\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWith recent increase of clinical MR field strength and gradient performance,\nadvanced imaging techniques have been proposed that allow new types of\ncontrast and tissue parameter quantification. However this advanced tech-\nniques are typically optimized to the adult brain which is known to have\ndifferent relaxation times T1 and T2 relative to the neonatal brain because\nof its higher water content. The main purpose of this work is to optimize\nadvanced imaging techniques such as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)\nand driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT1\nand DESPOT2) in order to be applied to the neonatal brain.\n\nIn this work, a neonatal SWI protocol was developed by adapting a\ngold standard adult protocol presented in the literature. Also a graphical\nuser interface was developed in order to provide an easy tool to reconstruct\nsusceptibility weighted images. Single compartment and multi-compartment\nDESPOT estimation precision was estimated from both a Monte Carlo (MC)\nand Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) approaches. CRLB is a statistical\ntool that allows us to estimate the minimum possible variance that can be\nobtained when estimating parameters of a mathematical model given a set\nof independent noisy measurements. Furthermore, the CRLB was used as a\ntool to optimize the DESPOT protocol regarding both precision and acqui-\nsition time.\n\nIn this work a neonatal SWI protocol is proposed. Also we show that the\nCRLB can be used to optimize the DESPOT1 and DESPOT2 acquisition\nscheme and that the number of measurements usually made can be reduced\nwithout significantly compromising parameter estimation.\n\nKeywords: MRI, Optimization, Estimation, SWI, DESPOT\n\niv\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIn this section of the thesis I want to thank everyone whom I feel to be\nimportant and that in some way or another helped me out during the real-\nization of this project.\n\nIn first place I must thank my family who always supported me and en-\ncouraged me to take risks and go abroad in order to grow as human being,\nwithout their support I would have never been able to enrol in this project.\n\nI must also thank my supervisors Jo and Rita who where amazing dur-\ning my stay at the CDB, they have both always shown great interest and\nsupport during this project and I would have never been able to grow as\nmuch as I did as a scientist without them.

As will be explained in section 2.1 each MR image voxel is recorded\nin the form of a complex number where magnitude and phase information\nreflect the interaction between specific nuclei and the applied magnetic fields.\n\nOn conventional MR techniques, often used in a clinical setting, phase\ninformation is discarded and only the magnitude image, composed of a mix-\nture of contrasts caused by different tissue properties, is used to probe the\ndesired information[1]. Advanced imaging techniques allow us to further\nimprove the quality of information obtained from MR imaging, and to eval-\nuate a larger range of tissue parameters. The ability to probe tissue specific\nproperties such as magnetic susceptibility, and relaxation times T1 and T2,\nhas been proven to be useful in detecting and understanding diseases [2, 3, 4].\n\nBeing able to quantify tissue properties is of special importance in the\nneonatal brain, because it opens a window of opportunity to study in vivo\nhow the human brain matures with age. The main goal of this project is\ntherefore to be able to adapt advanced imaging techniques such as Sus-\nceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse\nObservation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT), initially developed for adult imag-\ning, to visualise the newborn brain and how it matures with age.\n\nIn chapter 2 a brief explanation of the background necessary to intro-\nduce the work presented within this thesis is shown.\n\nChapter 3 will focus on the development of a SWI neonatal proto-\ncol. This involved proposing a dedicated neonatal protocol, including a\nre-evalution of the effect of varying slice thickness, developing a graphical\n\n1\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW\n\nuser interface to allow users to produce filtered images that emphasise sus-\nceptibility effects from raw SWI data.\n\nWithin chapter 4 it is discussed how to correctly process a set of multi-\nangle SPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimateT1andT2for both a one\ncompartment and two compartment model.\n\nChapter 5 focused in the use of the CRLB as an optimization tool for\nDESPOT.\n\n2\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nBackground Material\n\nWithin this chapter, the basic principles of magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) necessary to understand the work presented in this thesis are pre-\nsented.\n\nAs stated in [5] the idea of using spatial varying magnetic fields in order\nto obtain information about a given object was first proposed and demon-\nstrated by Lauterbur and Mansfield in 1973. This moment in history may\nbe considered as the birth of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which\nquickly evolved into the technique which is is nowadays used in Hospital\nenvironment.\n\n2.1 Basic Principles of MRI\n\nThe fundamental principals of MRI are based on the interaction between\natomic nuclei and external magnetic fields. When subjected to a static\nmagnetic field, some atomic nuclei present energy states with different en-\nergy levels, whose energy difference is proportional to the applied magnetic\nfield [6]. This effect is known as the Zeeman effect [6], and is direct conse-\nquence of the atomic nuclei intrinsic angular momentum also known as Spin.\n\n2.1.1 Larmor Frequency\n\nConsidering the case of a single proton, since it is a charged particle, its\nspin property can be related to a circulating electric current, and, therefore\nan associated magnetic moment [5]. The relationship between the magnetic\nmomentum and the spin angular momentum is defined as shown in Equation\n2.1.\n\n3\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\n~\u00b5 = ? ~J (2.1)\n\nIn Equation 2.1 the proportionality constant ? between the magnetic\nmoment ~\u00b5 and the spin angular moment ~J is called the gyromagnetic ratio\nand its value depends on the atomic nuclei under consideration[5]. The hu-\nman body has a very high content of water and therefore the gyromagnetic\nratio for the hydrogen nucleus which has a value ? = 42.58 MHz/T is a very\nimportant parameter in MRI. By combining Equation 2.1 with the expres-\nsion for torque on a magnetic moment due to an external magnetic field ~B0,\noriented along the z axis, we obtain the relationship shown in Equation 2.2\nwhich describes the rotation and precession movements of atomic nuclei.\n\nd~\u00b5\n\ndt\n= ?~\u00b5\u00d7 ~B0 (2.2)\n\nWhich can also be represented as,\n\nd\u00b5x\ndt\n\n= ?\u00b5yB0 (2.3)\n\nd\u00b5y\ndt\n\n= ??\u00b5xB0 (2.4)\n\nd\u00b5z\ndt\n\n= 0 (2.5)\n\nand by combining the first two equations gives,\n\nd2\n\ndt2\n\n(\n\u00b5x\n\u00b5y\n\n)\n+ (?B0)\n\n2\n\n(\n\u00b5x\n\u00b5y\n\n)\n= 0 (2.6)\n\nwhich has the solution,\n\n~\u00b5 =\n\n(\n\u00b5x0 cos ?t + \u00b5y0 sin ?t\n\u00b5y0 cos ?t?\u00b5x0 sin ?t\n\n)\n(2.7)\n\nwhere,\n\n? = ?B0 (2.8)\n\nThe quantity ? in equation 2.8 is known as the Larmor frequency and\nrepresents the resonance frequency at which the magnetic nuclei precess\naround the main magnetic field.[6] This frequency is also the basic prin-\nciple behind all MR imaging methods as it allows us to discriminate the\nsample in frequency steps by applying a gradient field B0 + r.G.[5, 6] For\nexample if we were to select a single slice, located at position z0, from a\nsample then, by adding a gradient Gz to the main field, it is possible to\ndiscriminate different Larmor frequencies along the z direction of the sam-\nple. Frequency discrimination is possible because only excitation pulses with\n\n4\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nfrequencies very similar to the Larmor frequency significantly interact with\nthe precessing atomic nuclei.[6]\n\n2.1.2 Free Induction Decay\n\nWhen in the presence of a static magnetic field, due to the generated torque\nprotons tend to align themselves with its direction, depending on their in-\ntrinsic spin, either along the parallel direction (low energy state) or the\nanti-parallel direction (high-energy state) (Figure 2.1). Through the inter-\n\nFigure 2.1: Two possible orientations for a proton when subjected to an\nexternal magnetic field. Adapted from [7]\n\naction with applied excitation pulses (also known as RF pulses) it is possible\nto disturb this equilibrium state and flip the magnetic moments. The most\ncommon flip pulses are the ?/2 pulse and the ? pulse that are responsible for\nflipping the magnetization vector by respectively 90o and 180o. Nevertheless\nit is possible to flip the magnetization moment by any angle by changing\nthe RF pulse accordingly.[5]\n\nWhen applying an ?/2 pulse the magnetization vector which was oriented\nalong the B0 field flips towards the transverse plane xy as shown in Figure\n2.2.

This signal is\nmodelled by the Bloch equations as explained in [5] and in [6]. This set of\nequations may be written as[6]:\n\ndMx,y\ndt\n\n= ?( ~M \u00d7 ~B0)xy ?\nMx,y\nT2\n\n(2.9)\n\ndMz\ndt\n\n= ?( ~M \u00d7 ~B0)z ?\nM0 ?Mz\n\nT1\n(2.10)\n\nwhere T2 and T1 are denominated, respectively, as the transverse and the\nlongitudinal relaxation times, and M0 is the equilibrium magnetization as-\nsumed to lie along the z axis. The application of a ?/2 pulse to the system\nalong the transverse plane results in:\n\ndMx\ndt\n\n= ?MyB0 ?\nMx\nT2\n\n(2.11)\n\ndMy\ndt\n\n= ??MxB0 ?\nMy\nT2\n\n(2.12)\n\nwith their respective solutions:\n\nMx(t) = M0e\n? t\nT2 cos(?B0t) (2.13)\n\nMy(t) = ?M0e\n? t\nT2 sin(?B0t) (2.14)\n\nfrom which we can extract the oscillating FID solution presented in Fig-\nure 2.3. We still need to consider the longitudinal solution of the Bloch\nequations. Since ~B0 lies entirely along the z axis Equation 2.10 becomes:\n\ndMz\ndt\n\n=\nM0 ?Mz\n\nT1\n(2.15)\n\nand by considering Mz(0) = 0 we obtain,\n\nMz(t) = M0[1 ?e\n?( t\n\nT1\n)\n] (2.16)\n\n6\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nwhich explains the longitudinal relaxation rate caused by \u201cspin-lattice\u201d in-\nteractions that induce the decay of the magnetization vector back to its\nresting state oriented along the B0 field.[6] \u201cSpin-spin\u201d interactions result\nin another relaxation effect that must be taken into account in order to\nobtain a more realistic assessment of the MR signal. After the ?/2 pulse\napplied at each time interval TR, spins interact with each other causing local\nmagnetic field variations and consequently, due to precessment movement\ndifferences, local Larmor frequencies changes arise.[5] This attenuation is\nmodeled by e?TE/T2 , where TE is the instant at which the data is sampled,\nallowing us to obtain the following expression to describe the transverse\nmagnetization evolution,\n\nMx,y(TE) = M0(1 ?e?TR/T1 )e?TE/T2 (2.17)\n\nThe T2 effect does not account for field inhomogeneities which produce ad-\nditional signal suppression. With this in mind it is of special importance to\ndefine a more global relaxation rate: the T?2 capable of taking into account\nexternal field induced effects (T ?2) and \u201cspin-spin\u201d interactions (T2).[5]\n\n1\n\nT?2\n=\n\n1\n\nT2\n+\n\n1\n\nT ?2\n(2.18)\n\nAs will be further explained in section 2.2.2, magnetic susceptibility di-\nrectly relates to local magnetic field inhomogeneities. Taking these signal\neffects into account is of special importance since different local field in-\nhomogeneities produce different levels of signal attenuation and dephasing,\nand therefore different levels of susceptibility contrast.\n\n2.1.3 Frequency Encoding\n\nAs stated in section 2.1.1 the addition of a linear varying field to the main\nmagnetic field allows us to create a linear space dependent Larmor frequency\ndistribution as shown in Equation 2.19.\n\n?G(z,t) = ?zG(t) (2.19)\n\nThe use of a gradient to establish a relation as shown in 2.19, where the\nposition of spins along a known direction results in a specific precessional\ndistribution is referred to as frequency encoding along that direction[5].\n\nFor the one dimensional case (1D) Equation 2.19 allows us to measure\nthe signal as being:\n\ns(k) =\n\n?\n?(z)e?i2?kzdz (2.20)\n\nhere, the time dependence is implicitly defined in the spatial frequency k :\nk(t) = ?\n\n? t\n0\ndt?G(t?).[5] Equation 2.20 is one of the main building blocks of\n\n7\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nMR imaging reconstruction when linear gradients are applied. The measured\nsignal s(k) is the Fourier transform of the spin density of the sample and as\na consequence the spin density can be determined by applying the inverse\nFourier transform of the signal s(k). [5]\n\n?(z) =\n\n?\ns(k)(e)+i2?kzdk (2.21)\n\n2.1.4 Gradient Echo\n\nGradient echo sequences are of special interest in the measurement of T?2 ef-\nfects since they are extremely sensitive to this relaxation rate. As stated in\nsection 2.1.2, T?2 is strongly correlated with field inhomogeneities and there-\nfore, by using acquisition sequences sensitive to this parameter it is possi-\nble to map local field variations. Haemoglobin (Hb) is an oxygen carrying\nmolecule present in red blood cells, whose magnetic properties depend on the\npresence or absence of oxygen. Oxyhaemoglobin (oHb) is diamagnetic and\nDeoxyhaemoglobin (dHb) is paramagnetic, therefore local magnetic proper-\nties are modified by the oxygenation state allowing Susceptibility Weighted\n(SW) imaging to make use of gradient echo sequences to map local magni-\ntude and phase changes that naturally occur in the human brain.[6] Thanks\nto dHb presence in venous blood vessels and bleeds, SW imaging is able to\nproduce reliable venographic images of the human brain as well as detecting\nmicro-bleeds inside it.\n\nIn a simple gradient echo sequence (Figure 2.4), an excitation pulse is\napplied (also known as RF-pulse), followed by a gradient field which is su-\nperimposed with B0. The RF-pulse causes the magnetization to flip towards\nthe xy plane. Nuclei found in more intense fields start precessing at larger\nfrequencies compared to the ones found in weaker fields resulting in spin\ndephasing. The applied gradient is then reversed at a later time allowing\nthe \u201cfast \u201d nuclei to be placed in a weaker field and vice-versa inducing as a\nresult a gradual rephasing of spins. [6] Nevertheless the rephasing gradient\nonly compensates the dephasing that is consequence of the first gradient\nlobe. Dephasing caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities or spin-spin in-\nteractions still cause a gradual signal intensity loss governed by[7],\n\nSGE = S(?,T1,S0)e\n?TE\nT?\n2 (2.22)\n\nwhere TE represents the echo time, S(?,T1,S0) is the signal immediately\nafter the application of the RF-pulse which tips the magnetization vector\n? degrees towards the xy plane. This equation reflects why susceptibility\neffects are so well enhanced by gradient echo sequences since they strongly\naffect T?2 .\n\n8\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nFigure 2.4: Example of a simple gradient-echo sequence. In b spins are initially\npositioned along the y axis and are rapidly dephased by the negative lobe as\nshown in c. When the positive gradient is switched on (d), the spins begin to\nrephase, forming an echo (e). If the positive gradient is left on as show in f\n\ndephasing will occur again. Adapted from [7]\n\nThis signal attenuation effect is characteristic of magnitude images, how-\never, in SWI we are interested in the full complex description of the MR\nsignal. With this in mind it is important to define the full signal-intensity\nresponse to a gradient echo sequence. For a right handed system as described\nin [5] we have:\n\nSGE(?) = ?m(?)e\n?i??BTE (2.23)\n\nwhere ? is the flip angle induced by the RF-pulse and ?B represents the\nlocal field deviation caused by the susceptibility differences.\n\n2.1.5 SPGR - Spoiled Gradient Echo\n\nFor a gradient echo sequence with TR >> T2, all transverse magnetization\nis zero before the next RF-pulse is applied, this is known as a spoiled gra-\ndient sequence. However this results in long acquisition times which is not\npractical if we want to do a certain amount of measurements with different\nFA. We are interested in a regime where TR &lt;T2 (fast sequence), however\n\n9\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nthis implies that there is still some transverse magnetization prior to each\nRF pulse. In this situation spoiling may be obtained by applying a spoiler\ngradient that forces the transverse magnetization to be zero.[5]\n\nIt is important to guarantee that spoiling occurs before each RF pulse\nbecause it allows the magnetization vector to evolve towards a steady-state\nsolution that is well known throughout the literature [5, 9, 10, 11, 12] and\nshown in the following equation:\n\nSGE ? SPGR = ?0\n1 ?E1\n\n1 ?E1 cos(?)\nsin(?) (2.24)\n\nwhere, ? is the voxel proton spin density, ? is the applied flip angle and E1\nis e?TR/T1 .\n\nEquation 2.24 is actually known as the Ernst formula [12] and can\nonly be applied as long as the correct spoiling before each RF pulse is\nguaranteed. If no spoiling is applied a transverse magnetization interfer-\nence appears altering the expected signal behaviour either constructively or\ndestructively[5, 12].\n\n2.1.6 SSFP - Steady State Free Precession\n\nThe steady state free precession (SSFP) is a very fast gradient echo sequence,\nthat makes use of both longitudinal and transverse magnetization to pro-\nduce a dynamic equilibrium state for a fixed TR&lt;&lt;T2 &lt;T1 [10, 12, 13].\n\nBecause both longitudinal and transverse magnetization need to be taken\ninto account on this type of MR sequence a more complex mathematical\ndescription of this signal is necessary. Assuming an initial magnetization\nM0, relaxation variables E1 = e\n\n?TR/T1 and E2 = e\n?TR/T2 it is possible\n\nto write out the individual components of the magnetization vector in its\nsteady-state [5]:\n\nMSSx = M0(1 ?E1)\nE2 sin ? sin(?)\n\nd\n(2.25)\n\nMSSy = M0(1 ?E1)\nE2 sin ?(cos(?) ?E2)\n\nd\n(2.26)\n\nMSSz = M0(1 ?E1)\n[1 ?E2 cos(?)) ?E2 cos(?)(cos(?) ?E2)]\n\nd\n(2.27)\n\nwhere,\n\nd = (1 ?E1 cos(?))(1 ?E2 cos(?)) ?E2(E1 ? cos(?))(E2 ? cos(?)) (2.28)\n\nHere, ? = ??t = ??Bt is defined as the resonance offset frequency.\nThis parameter is strongly dependent on the static field and since it changes\n\n10\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nFigure 2.5: SSFP signal variation with offset frequency for different flip angles.\nT1 = 1086ms, T2 = 69ms and TR = 3.567ms are fixed.\n\nwith position along the object the resulting SSFP signal is also position de-\npendent. Figure 2.5 illustrates the SSFP signal behaviour for fixed T1 and T2\nparameters over different flip angles as a function of offset frequency. With\nthis in mind it is easy to anticipate that as the static field changes around an\nobject significantly the measured signal will also change accordingly. This\nhowever, can be avoided by performing a good shimming inside the object\nguaranteeing as low field variation as possible.[5]\n\n2.2 SWI - Susceptibility Weighted Imaging\n\nOne of the goals of this thesis is to adapt SWI, initially developed for the\nadult brain, to the neonatal brain. In order to accomplish this objective a\ngood understanding of how this kind of images are obtained is required, and\ntherefore a introductory discussion of the concepts needed to understand\nthis type of MR imaging is presented within this section.\n\n2.2.1 Comprehending SWI\n\nInterpreting SW images for clinical diagnostic purposes, requires special\ncare so that correct information is obtained. There are 3 major compo-\nnents that must be taken into account[1], the first component is the magni-\ntude data. Gradient echo magnitude images clearly reflect areas with either\nshort T?2 or an oscillatory signal intensity caused by the presence of de-\noxyhaemoglobin(dHb) in the major veins, with the latter being the main\nresponsible factor for the signal loss visible in these images. For a sub-\nvoxel sized vein, this signal loss results in hypointense voxel relative to its\n\n11\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nsurroundings, while on the other hand, a voxel containing only intravenous\nsignal will not show this cancellation effect, and therefore the vein appears\nbright inside with a hypointense ring around it.[1]\n\nThe second relevant component is the phase image. Depending on the\nscanner manufacturer\u2019s adopted convention,[14] veins will have negative\nphase values (because of the paramagnetic property of dHb) while calcium\ndeposits will have positive phase values (because calcium is diamagnetic)[1],\nor vice-versa.\n\nThe third component is the processing required to obtain the final SW\nimage. By combining T?2 decay suppression effects presented on the magni-\ntude information and venous blood susceptibility differences relative to its\nsurroundings recorded in the phase image, one single set of SW images is\nproduced that enhances small veins present in the human brain. The venous\nvessels usually appear as black dots across each imaged slice representing\ncross-sections of them. The mIP is therefore performed in order to check\nthe connectivity of these dots along different slices, and allowing clinicians\nto distinguish between blood vessels and micro-bleeds.[1]\n\nWithin the following sections a more complete description of what mag-\nnetic susceptibility is as well as of each component will be presented, so that\na correct understanding of the work presented in Chapter 3 is accomplished.\n\n2.2.2 Magnetic Susceptibility\n\nSusceptibility information complements that available with conventional\nspin density, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging.[1] In order to understand how\nSWI may provide different clinical information it\u2019s important to understand\nwhat susceptibility is and how it can help us map different tissues when in\nthe presence of deoxygenated blood, iron or calcium.\n\nMagnetic susceptibility is related to the conformational response of a\nsubstance when placed inside an external magnetic field. When inside an\nuniform magnetic field the bulk magnetization ~MB induced on a substance\nis given by,\n\n~MB = ?~H (2.29)\n\nrecalling that the magnetic field induced ( ~B) on a substance exposed to a\nmagnetic field strength ~H is ~B = \u00b50( ~H + ~MB) we obtain,\n\n~B = \u00b50( ~H + ~MB) = \u00b50(1 + ?) ~H = \u00b50\u00b5r ~H = \u00b5~H (2.30)\n\nwhere \u00b5, \u00b5o and \u00b5r are respectively the magnetic permeability of the sub-\nstance, the magnetic permeability in vacuum and the relative magnetic per-\n\n12\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nmeability. From Equation 2.30 we may obtain,\n\n~MB = ?~B/\u00b50(1 + ?) (2.31)\n\nwhich for linear materials where ? ? 1, leads to\n\n~MB = ?~B/\u00b50 (2.32)\n\nfrom which we may conclude that the induced magnetization is directly\nproportional to the main magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility[1]\nsuggesting that depending on the tissue composition we may obtain different\nlocal fields, therefore opening a window for susceptibility mapping since the\nLarmor frequency is directly dependent on the local field.\n\n2.2.2.1 Geometry Effects\n\nMagnetic susceptibility distorts the uniform field outside an object as a\nfunction of its geometry. Following the description presented in [1] and [15],\nthe local field variation inside a cylinder placed at an angle ? relative to the\nmain field B0 is given by[1], [5],\n\n?Bin = ??B0(3 cos\n2 ? ? 1)/6 + ?eB0/3 (2.33)\n\nwhere ?? = ?i ? ?e and ?e and ?i are the susceptibilities outside and\ninside the cylinder. Usually when looking at local field changes, the term\n?eB0/3 is constant both inside and outside the cylinder and therefore may\nbe dropped when considering field variations between different tissues. ??\nmay be estimated for the case of deoxygenated blood as,\n\n?? = 4?A(0.18ppm)Hct(1 ?Y ) (2.34)\n\nwhere A is a constant determined by the susceptibility of blood in vivo, Hct\nis the hematocrit, and Y is the oxygen saturation.[1, 16, 17]\n\nFor the field variation outside the considered vessel, by taking a as the\nvessel radius, which is considered as a long cylinder positioned at an angle ?\nrelative to the main field, r is the distance perpendicularly from the axis of\nthe cylinder to the considered position and ? is the angle between the vector\nr and the projection of the main field direction onto a plane perpendicular\nto the axis of the vessel[1, 5], we obtain the following relationship resulting\nin the field distribution shown in Figure 2.6:\n\n?Bout = ??B0 sin\n2 ? cos(2?)a2/(2r2) (2.35)\n\nThe key point of presenting this field variation with geometry is to relate\nthis information to the signal phase of equation 2.23 and verify that:\n\n?? = ???BTE (2.36)\n\n13\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nFigure 2.6: Magnetic field distribution resulting from a cylinder placed\nperpendicular to B0. Adapted from [18].\n\nand therefore, the phase variation is dependent on the vessel geometry.[1,\n18, 19, 20]\n\nWhen susceptibility-induced local field variations are present within an\nimaging voxel, there is a resulting distribution of Larmor frequencies for\nthe protons within that voxel, resulting in signal loss which is the source of\nBlood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast.[21] In 1997, Reichenbach\net al.[22], showed that with the right pulse sequence, it is possible to depict\nblood vessels with diameters of less than a millimeter by making use of the\nBOLD effect. The next section shows how this signal variation in the phase\nimage can be used to identify signal variations produced by dHb in order to\nenhance visualization of small veins in the human brain.\n\n2.2.2.2 Phase Filtering for Highlighting Susceptibility Variations\n\nBackground field inhomogeneities tend to cause low spatial frequency phase\nvariations[19]. Also, because one is only capable of mapping phase varia-\ntions within the [??,?) interval phase wrappings occur, making it harder\nto identify useful phase information. Fortunately we are only interested\nin highlighting local susceptibility variations which correspond to high fre-\n\n14\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nquency information in the phase image. With this in mind, as described in\n[19] it is possible to remove phase wrapping and inhomogeneity effects by\ncomplex dividing the original image with the image obtained by low-pass-\nfiltering (LP-filter) k-space data, and therefore, obtaining a high-pass-filter\n(HP-filter) effect on the image.\n\nTaking a more mathematical approach, if we consider the original com-\nplex signal ?0(x),\n\n?0(x) = |?0(x)|ei?f (x)+i?v(x) = F?1[S(k)] (2.37)\n\nas being the complex image information, where F is the Fourier transform\noperator, ?f (x) is the phase component which we assume to correspond to\nbackground variations, ?v(x) contains local susceptibility variations of in-\nterest such as venous blood information, and S(k) is the original k-space\ninformation. For simplicity only these two components are considered but\nother sources of magnetic field variations also contribute to both ?f (x) and\n?v(x)\n\nAs stated above we assume that background field inhomogeneities only\ngenerate low frequency variations and therefore, by truncating the original\ndata and zero padding the resulting k-space to have the same size as the\noriginal k-space information, we obtain a low-pass filter effect (n point H(k)\nfilter). The obtained low-pass filtered image is then:\n\n?lp(x) = |?lp(x)|ei?f (x) = F?1[S(k)H(k)] (2.38)\n\nWe may then use this information to complex divide the original image so\nthat,\n\n?hp(x) =\n|?0(x)|ei?f (x)+i?v(x)\n\n|?lp(x)|ei?f (x)\n? |?hp(x)|ei?v(x) (2.39)\n\nThe phase ?v(x) is now approximately free of low-frequency variations. An\nexample of this process is demonstrated in Figure 2.7. As seen in Figure 2.7\n(b) vessel information is highlighted suggesting that this approach may allow\nvessel topography with deoxygenated blood as a natural occurring contrast\nagent.\n\n2.2.3 Creation of SWI\n\nSWI aims to create a different type of MRI contrast that complements the\ninformation from conventional T1 and T2 sequences. This is done by making\nuse of both magnitude and phase information of a transversal 3D spoiled\ngradient echo MR signal with low white matter to gray matter contrast,\nallowing susceptibility effects to be mapped in the magnitude image after\n\n15\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.7: (a) Raw phase image of an adult human brain. It is possible to see\nphase wraps specially close to the border of the brain. (b) Same image presented\nin (a) after applying the High Pass filter discussed in section 2.2.2.2. It is possible\n\nto see that vessel information is highlighted (black arrows).\n\nsome post-processing.\n\nIn 2000, Y. Wang et al.[19], suggested using HP-filtered phase images in\norder to produce phase masks that could be applied to the commonly used\nmagnitude image in order to enhance susceptibility effects and therefore\ndepict small blood vessels. This so called phase-masks[1, 19, 14, 23] are the\nkey-point of SWI\u2019s ability to produce venographic images. Once they are\napplied to the magnitude image they enhance small vessel contrast relative\nto the background and therefore increase the ability to depict them.\n\n2.2.3.1 Phase Mask\n\nFigure 2.8: Brain mask extracted from HP-filtered image show in Figure 2.7 b).\nAll positive phase values were linearly scaled to the [0, 1] interval as described in\n\nthis section. The black arrows indicate areas where vessels are present and\ntherefore they were linearly scaled to values close to 0 in the phase mask.\n\nThere are several different phase masks that may be extracted from the\nphase image depending on what phase information is considered relevant to\n\n16\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nenhance venographic contrast. According to [19], and because of the local\nfield behaviour discussed in section 2.2.2.1, the venous blood phase should\nbe either negative or positive depending on the vein orientation relative to\nthe main magnetic field.\n\nMore precisely three orientation intervals should be considered, corre-\nsponding to angles smaller than 55? (positive phase), values close to 55?\n\n(null phase) and values larger than 55? (negative phase).[19] However, this\npredicted behaviour is not respected thanks to partial volume effects that\nmust be taken into account.[18] Y. Xu et al.[18], studied how different voxel\nsizes and positions relative to a long cylinder positioned perpendicularly to\nthe main magnetic field change the measured phase, introducing the concept\nof voxel aspect ratio. Also, it is important to note, that the convention used\nto define positive phase is not the same for all vendors and therefore special\ncare must be taken in order to accommodate this issue[14].\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 2.9: Comparison between different phase masks proposed by different\nauthors in literature. a) negative phase mask, b) positive phase mask, c)\n\nasymmetric negative phase mask, d) asymmetric positive phase mask\n\nOnce the correct phase of interest is chosen the phase mask (Figure 2.8)\nis generated by performing a linear scaling that sets to 1 the pixels with\nphase values that we want to keep unchanged and sets to 0 pixels with\nphase values that we want to suppress (Figure 2.9). By selecting an appro-\npriate voxel aspect ratio it is possible to obtain phase values that lie in the\n\n17\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\n[??, 0) or in the (0,?] interval[18]. Therefore, as an example, if the phase of\ninterest lies within the (0,?] interval, the phase mask is defined by setting\nall values on the [??, 0) interval to unity, and setting the (0,?] interval as\n?scaled = ??measured/? + 1. An example of this so called positive filter, or\npositive phase mask applied to an adult human brain is shown in Figure 2.8.\nThis approach leads to a maximum signal cancellation for veins in parallel\norientation relative to the main magnetic field, and also gives good results\nfor vessels perpendicular to B0[20]. More examples of proposed phase masks\nfound in the literature are presented in Figure 2.9.\n\n2.2.3.2 Minimum Intensity Projection - mIP\n\nAfter selecting the appropriate phase mask, the SWI processing assembly\nline ends with a minimum intensity projection (mIP) of a selected range\nof contiguous slices of the image that results from the multiplication of the\noriginal magnitude image by the extracted phase mask[20]. Since the phase\nmask was designed to suppress high susceptibility pixels while maintaining\nthe rest intact, this multiplication enhances venographic contrast, by im-\nposing a susceptibility weighting on the magnitude image. A mIP is then\nperformed in order to project a topographic effect that helps keep track of\nthe vessels through different imaged slices therefore giving a 3D angiography\neffect. An example of the mIP projection can be seen in Figure 2.10.\n\nFigure 2.10: Minimum Intensity Projection of the multiplication of Figure 2.8\nby its respective magnitude image. It is possible to track some venous paths\n\nsuggesting SWI is a good tool for venographic mapping.\n\n2.2.3.3 Voxel Aspect Ratio\n\nOne important aspect of SWI that was not yet discussed within this thesis\nis the role of the acquisition voxel size and position relative the imaged ves-\nsels. Because of the variety of vessel sizes presented inside the human brain,\nstudies which aim to optimize acquisition voxel size in order to obtain good\n\n18\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nglobal vessel visualization, have been previously presented [18, 24]. Defining\nvoxel aspect ratio (AR) as being the ratio between voxel thickness and voxel\nin-plane resolution, the work published by Yingbiao Xu in 2005 [18], sug-\ngests that a theoretical AR of 2 should be used for best vessel visualization,\nhowever they found that in practice an AR of 4 gives better visualization.\nTherefore it is common practice to acquire SWI with an AR of either 2 or\n4.\n\n2.2.4 SWI - Neonate Approach\n\nThe neonatal brain has a higher water content (92 ? 95%) than the adult\nbrain (82?85%), and as a consequence of that T1 and T2 values are larger.[25]\nThis means that when scanning neonates optimal TE and TR must be chosen\nto compensate for this higher water content. For an adult SW brain scan\nat 3T field strength, the typical MR parameters are TR = 30ms and TE =\n20ms as presented in [1], on the other hand, typical neonatal SW imaging\nacquisition parameters as presented by [26] are TR = 52ms and TE = 30ms.\n\n2.3 DESPOT - Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse\nObservation of T1 and T2\n\nDriven equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT) origi-\nnally called variable nutation angle method was first introduced as a way to\nestimate T1 by applying a set of spoiled gradient echo sequences (SPGR) over\ndifferent flip angles [9]. The DESPOT nomenclature was first introduced by\nJohn Homer and Martin S. Beevers in 1985 [9] and further expanded to\nDESPOT1 and DESPOT2 by Deoni et al. in 2003 [10] when they suggested\nthe use of a steady-state free precession sequence (SSFP) to map T2 infor-\nmation after T1 had been assessed.\n\nIn simple terms DESPOT1 and DESPOT2 (referred to as DESPOT in\nthis text) consists in acquiring a set of measurements over different flip an-\ngles (FA) and fitting the expected behaviour in order to estimate T1 and T2\nrelaxation times inside each voxel. To fully understand how this is possible\nit is important to comprehend the physical processes behind each signal in\norder to be able to predict the obtained results.\n\n2.3.1 Obtaining T1 and T2 from collected data\n\nThe parameters of interest T1 and T2 are obtained from a set of SPGR and\nSSFP images acquired at fixed TR and incrementally increased flip angle ?.\n\n19\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nFollowing the description presented in [10] the SPGR can be represented in\nthe linear form by:\n\nSSPGR\nsin(?)\n\n= E1\nSSPGR\ntan(?)\n\n+ M0(1 ?E1) (2.40)\n\nfrom which the slope m and Y-intercept b can be estimated by linear regres-\nsion, allowing us to extract T1 and M0 as being:\n\nT1 = ?TR/ln(m) (2.41)\n\nM0 = b/(1 ?m) (2.42)\n\nAfterwards, T1 is used in order to fit T2 from the linearised version of the\nSSFP equations:\n\nSSSFP\nsin(?)\n\n=\nE1 ?E2\n1 ?E1E2\n\n\u00d7\nSSSFP\ntan(?)\n\n+\nM0(1 ?E1)\n1 ?E1E2\n\n(2.43)\n\nwhere, also by linear regression we obtain a new m and b resulting in,\n\nT2 = ?TR/ln(\nm?E1\nmE1 ? 1\n\n) (2.44)\n\nM0 = b(E1E2 ? 1)/(1 ?E1) (2.45)\n\nWithin this thesis, it was decided that instead of linearising the problem\nand fitting first for T1 and then for T2 a more interesting approach would be\nto simultaneously fit for T1 and T2 using MatLab 2012a optimization routine\nfminsearch. A more complete description of this optimization procedure is\ndescribed in Chapter 4.\n\n2.3.2 mcDESPOT - Multi Component DESPOT\n\nA limitation of the DESPOT method for estimating T1 and T2 is the as-\nsumption of a single source of signal inside each voxel[27]. This assumption\nignores the inherently complex structure of biological tissues. In order to\novercome this issue, Deoni et al. presented in 2008 a very interesting paper\n[27] in which a two exchanging water-pools model was proposed in order to\nexplain the observed signal inside each voxel. Following previous work pre-\nsented by Spenser and Fishbein [11] and Deoni et al.[28, 29], a fast decaying\npool corresponding to trapped water inside myelin (F) and a slower decaying\npool corresponding to water outside the myelin sheet (S) where considered.\nWith this in mind the total equilibrium magnetization M0 results from the\nsum of individual fractional proton densities (fF and fS) with their corre-\nsponding decay rates T1,F = 1/R1,F , T1,S = 1/R1,S, T2,F = 1/R2,F and\n\n20\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\nT2,S = 1/R2,S. Assuming a constant exchange rate (k) between the two\npools (kFS = 1/?FS and kSF = 1/?SF ) at equilibrium we have\n\nfFkFS = fSkSF (2.46)\n\nand,\nfS = 1 ?fF (2.47)\n\nresulting in a seven dimensional problem that needs to be solved for M0,\nkFS, fF , T1,F , T2,F , T1,S and T2,S. By incorporating this set-up into the\nBloch-McConnell equations (Equation 2.48) we obtain:\n\ndM\n\ndt\n= AM + C (2.48)\n\nAssuming a periodic instantaneous excitation along the x-axis, the steady\nstate solution to this problem may be found as [11, 27, 29, 30, 31]\n\nMSSSSFP = [I ?e\nASSFPTRR(?)]?1(eASSFPTR ?

The\n\nSPGR signal can be viewed as a more specific solution to the Bloch-McConnell\nequation where all transverse magnetization is set to zero prior to each rf-\npulse. In this case the solution to Equation 2.48 becomes[27, 31]\n\nMSSSPGR = M0 sin ?[I ?e\nASPGRTR cos ?]?1(I ?eASPGRTR)\n\n[\nfF\nfS\n\n]\n(2.54)\n\nwith,\n\nASPGR =\n\n[\n?R1,F ?kFS kSF\n\nkFS ?R1,S ?kSF\n\n]\n(2.55)\n\nThis set of equations constitute the two-pool model of DESPOT. One flaw\nthat can be assigned to this two-pool model is that it doesn\u2019t take into ac-\ncount partial volume effects i.e., voxels containing brain tissue and ventricle\nor meninges, result in myelin water fraction underestimation [30]. In order to\novercome this issue, Deoni et al. presented in 2012 a three-pool model that\nincorporated a new, non-exchanging \u201cfree water\u201d component. The three-\npool model is similar to the two-pool model and a complete description may\nbe found in [30].\n\n22\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSusceptibility Weighted\nImaging of the Neonatal\nBrain\n\nAs stated in section 2.2, SWI is very sensitive to susceptibility variations\nbetween oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin.[32] In the same section\nthe common SWI processing pipeline was also described. In this chapter the\ngold standard SWI protocol for the adult brain is presented alongside with\nits adaptation to the neonatal brain which is known to have longer relaxation\ntimes.[25]\n\n3.1 SWI Adult Protocol\n\nA review of the literature confirmed that the protocol provided by Haacke\net al. in their 2009 review paper [1] is in fact standard. Here, they stated\nthat in order to obtain optimum vein contrast at 1.5T, an echo time (TE)\nbetween 40 and 80 ms must be chosen. Furthermore, if we recall from sec-\ntion 2.2.2.1 the linear relationship between phase and field strength it is\nstraightforward to understand that with a field strength of 3T the optimal\nTE values would drop to between 20 and 40 ms.\n\nAccording to [15, 33, 34], the typical SWI adult protocol on a 3T MR\nsystem involves a 3D, fully flow-compensated gradient echo sequence using\nthe following parameters:\n\n\u2022 TE ? 20 ms\n\n\u2022 TR ? 30 ms\n\n\u2022 Flip Angle ? 15?\n\n23\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

It is possible to see blood vessels as hypo-intense signals. (b)\nPhase image of the same brain presented in (a). It is possible to see that vessel\n\ninformation is highlighted.\n\nAs a first step towards implementing SWI in the neonatal brain, a neona-\ntal protocol was proposed based on simulations over a range of T1 and T2\ntissue parameters expected in the neonatal brain as described further in this\nthesis (section 3.4):\n\n\u2022 TE = 25 ms\n\n\u2022 TR = 32 ms\n\n\u2022 Flip Angle = 12?\n\n\u2022 voxel size 0.5 mm \u00d70.5 mm \u00d72 mm\n\n\u2022 SENSE factor 2\n\nThis protocol was used as starting point for developing the SWI post-\nprocessing pipeline and protocol adaptation towards the neonatal brain.\n\n24\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nIn order to have some test data to develop the necessary post-processing\nscripts the proposed neonatal protocol was tested on an adult volunteer\n(Figure 3.1). The data was acquired on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner and\ninformed consent was given by the volunteer according to a local ethical\napproval. A magnitude and phase image obtained with this protocol is\npresented in Figure 3.1.\n\n3.2 Exploring Phase Information\n\nAs stated in [14], phase information depends on manufacturer convention.\nThis means that the same venous vessel may appear with positive phase on a\nPhillips scanner and negative on a Siemens scanner depending on the phase\nconvention that each system uses. Therefore it is of highest importance to\nfully understand which phase information we are interested in so that we\ncan correctly apply the filters described in section 2.2.2.2. Looking more\ncarefully to the phase image obtained (Figure 3.2) we can see that the vessel\ninformation is positive and therefore the phase mask in the post-processing\npipeline (section 2.2.2.2) should also be positive.\n\nFigure 3.2: Transversal slice of an adult brain phase image. In the image scale\nall values range from ?? to ?. It is important to see that vessel information has\n\npositive phase.\n\n25\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\n3.3 Development of a Graphical User Interface\n\nThe post-processing scripts that allow the creation of SWI from both the\nmagnitude and phase images, were developed by integrating MatLab 2012a\nwith FSL-FMRIB Software Library v5.0. However for users which are not\nfamiliar with programming environment the use of scripts to obtain clinical\nrelevant data may become confusing. With this in mind, in order to facili-\ntate this processing step a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in\nMatLab 2012a with the guide toolbox environment(Figure 3.3).\n\nFigure 3.3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed in order to facilitate the\napplication of the SWI processing pipeline.\n\nThis interface assumes a .PAR/.REC image file, as exported from Philips\nScanners. The \u201cSelect File\u201d and \u201cImport File\u201d buttons, allow the user to\nbrowse until finding the desired file and import it. The Display section\n(Figure 3.4) has a drop-box that allows the user to switch between different\ntypes of images that will be displayed in the blank space in Figure 3.3.\nInitially, it only allows the user to chose between magnitude and phase\nimages, after the SWI is created then it also allows the user to view the\nsusceptibility weighted image, the high-pass filtered image and the positive\nand negative phase mask images.\n\nThe Homodyne Filtering Approach Section (Figure 3.5) allows the user\nto easily define the homodyne filtering parameters, where the filter size must\n\n26\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nFigure 3.4: SWI GUI Display Section. Allows the user to select which images\nshould be displayed by the interface.\n\nFigure 3.5: SWI GUI Filtering Section. This section allows the user to easily\ndefine the homodyne filtering parameters, the filter size must be defined as a\n\nfraction of the phase encoding steps, SWI-factor is defined as the number of times\nthe phase-mask is applied to the magnitude image, the Image Resolution\n\nparameters needs to be defined by the user.\n\nbe defined as a fraction of the phase encoding steps. SWI-factor is defined\nas the number of times the phase-mask is applied to the magnitude image,\nwhile the Image Resolution parameters must be defined by the user. The\n\u201cGenerate SW Image\u201d button uses the defined parameters to generate the\nsusceptibility weighted image.\n\nFigure 3.6: SWI GUI Tools Section. This section offers the possibility to define\ntwo points and compute the contrast by difference (CD) and the contrast ratio\n\n(CR) between them. The \u201cLOI\u201d and \u201cPlot LOI\u201d buttons allow the user to draw,\ncompute and plot the CR along the line length.\n\nThe Tools section in Figure 3.6 allows the user to analyse the displayed\nslice. Two points can be be selected by pressing the \u201cSelect P1\u201d and \u201cSelect\nP2\u201d buttons, or by typing the image pixel coordinate in the respective space,\nin order to compute the contrast by difference (CD = |P1 ? P2|) and the\n\n27\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nFigure 3.7: Example of the plot obtained from the \u201cLOI\u201d and \u201cPlot LOI\u201d\nbuttons. The plot in blue (left-top corner) is the CR over the length of the red\n\nline drawn in the image.\n\ncontrast ratio (CR = (P1 ?P2)/(P1 + P2)). The \u201cChange Contrast\u201d button\nopens a small MatLab tool named imcontrst that allows the user to change\nthe displayed image contrast to better view some structures. The \u201cLOI\u201d\nand \u201cPlot LOI\u201d buttons allow the user to draw a line, compute and plot the\nCR along the line length (Figure 3.7).\n\nFigure 3.8: SWI GUI export section, this allows the user to export the ticked\nimages.\n\nThe export section in Figure 3.8 allows the user to export the ticked\nimages either in \u201cNIFTI\u201d format or in \u201c.bmp\u201d format.\n\nTo finalize there is the Figure Options section (Figure 3.9). This sec-\n\n28\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\ntion has three buttons that allow the user to show the previous selected\npoints and line (\u201cShow P1 and P2\u201d and \u201cShow Line\u201d buttons) and a \u201cGen-\nerate mIPs\u201d button that generates a minimum intensity projection image\nof the previously computed SWI. The tick-boxes \u201cInvert mIP Range\u201d and\n\u201cInvert Phase Mask Range\u201d allow the user to invert the image scale of the\nminimum intensity projection and the phase masks in order to give a more\nangiography-like effect. The tick-box \u201cRecord LOI output in file\u201d when\nticked records the data analysed along each drawn line to an output file in\norder to be analysed later.\n\nFigure 3.9: SWI GUI Figure Options sections.\n\n3.4 Neonatal Protocol\n\nFigure 3.10: This figure represents how the signal and relative contrast changes\nover different echo times and flip angles.\n\n29\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nAs stated previously in this text(section 2.2.4) the relaxation times in the\nneonatal brain are different from the adult brain.[25] Therefore it is neces-\nsary to optimize the sequence parameters (TE and FA) in order to obtained\na low WM/GM contrast with as high signal intensity as possible, the low\nWM/GM contrast is important because in SWI we are not interested in this\ntype of contrast but on using the magnitude image to map susceptibility ef-\nfects. In order to assess this a plot of the CR over different TR = TE + 7 (the\nnumber 7ms is the minimum time difference allowed by the scanner between\nTR and TE) ms and FA parameters was done (Figure 3.10). This simulation\nassumed white matter relaxation times of T1 = 2500 ms and T2 = 240 ms\nand gray matter relaxation times of T2 = 1800 ms and T2 = 144 ms [35].\n\nBy analysing Figure 3.10 one can decide on a good compromise between\nexpected signal intensity and desired contrast. As stated above in this text,\nin SWI we are interested in obtaining images with as low WM/GM contrast\nas possible while guaranteeing a good signal intensity, it was therefore de-\ncided, by inspecting Figure 3.10 to test a range of repetition times between\n28 ms and 32 ms and a range of flip angles between 10? and 14?. This range\nof parameters was tested on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner and data was\nobtained on newborns less than one week old with informed consent given\nby their parents according to local ethical approval requirements, in order\nto assess which set of parameters would give a good result.\n\n3.5 Revisiting Voxel Aspect Ratio\n\nIn section 2.2.3.3 a small introduction on the gold-standard SWI voxel ac-\nquisition size was presented. This kind of voxel ratio allows an excellent\nvisualisation of the transversal plain, however, information from the other\ntwo planes of view (Sagittal and Coronal) is much worse.\n\nFigure 3.11: Susceptibility Weighted Image of a baby brain acquired with\nin-plain resolution of 0.65 mm \u00d70.65 mm and a voxel thickness of 2.6 mm.\n\nLooking at Figure 3.11 we can see that the obtained SNR is very good\n\n30\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nand the vessel structures are very well depicted. But we are interested in\nbeing able to visualize these structures over all three planes, so, in order\nto accomplish this goal we suggest to, instead of acquiring images with a\n1:4 voxel ratio, to do it with a 1:1 voxel ratio. Deistung et al. showed in\ntheir 2008 paper [24] how SWI contrast changes with different voxel AR.\nAccording to this study, best SWI contrast is obtained for AR larger than 2,\nhowever within this thesis it was decided that the predicted loss in contrast\nfrom an AR of 1 compared to an AR > 2 does not compensate the loss of\nrelevant information in the Sagittal and Transversal planes of view. An AR\nof 1 will reduce the SNR per voxel but, on the other hand, it will allow us\nto visualise vessel information on all three directions.\n\nFigure 3.12: Magnetic field distribution resulting from a cylinder perpendicular\nto a static magnetic field B0. The white boxes indicate voxels with aspect ratios\nof 0.5, 1, 2, and 4. The geometric relationship voxels, vein and field distribution\n\nare shown in the right side figure. Adapted from [24]\n\nSpecial care must be taken when changing the AR to 1 because of the\nexpected phase distribution shown in Figure 3.12. When using an AR of 4\nthe positive mask was more favourable in order to guarantee that only the\nsignal at the center of the vessels is decreased. However for a 1:1 ratio we\nfound it to be more favourable to adopt a positive phase mask to enhance\nvessels in transverse plane, while using a negative phase mask to enhance\nvessels in the Sagittal and Coronal planes (Figure 3.13). In this way the\ncenter of the vessels is enhanced on all three planes of view, while if we\nhad adopted only a positive phase mask we would have produced a signal\ndecrease at the center of the vessels when viewing from the transverse plane,\nand at the borders of the vessels when viewing from the coronal and sagittal\n\n31\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nplanes. This guarantees that the signal of the vessels is always decreased at\ntheir center avoiding the overestimation of their diameter.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.13: (a) Newborn magnitude image obtained with 1:1 voxel ratio. (b)\nNewborn positive phase mask SWI with 1:1 voxel ratio. (c) Newborn negative\n\nphase mask SWI with 1:1 voxel ratio.\n\n3.6 Minimum Intensity Projection of 1:1 voxel ra-\ntio images\n\nWhen acquiring images at 1:4 voxel ratio, because the voxel thickness is so\nmuch bigger than the in-plane resolution, usually it is only useful to cre-\nate minimum intensity projections along the transverse plane. On the other\nhand, when acquiring images at a 1:1 ratio it becomes reasonable to produce\nminimum intensity projection images along the three different planes of view.\n\nThe GUI \u201cGenerate mIPs\u201d button (recall Figure 3.9) was hence modified\nin order to produce minimum intensity projections along the three planes of\nview, and therefore, allowing us to obtain images such as shown in Figure\n3.14.\n\n32\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE\nNEONATAL BRAIN\n\nFigure 3.14: Minimum intensity projection of a SWI of a newborn brain\nacquired with a 1:1 voxel ratio.\n\nThese images allow the user to have a sense of how each vessel or struc-\nture relates to each other over the entire brain. This is of special interest for\ndepicting when small bleeds occurs inside the brain, because having a view\nover different three planes allows an easier differentiation of their shape and\nsize.\n\n3.7 Neonatal Brain SWI\n\nWithin this chapter it was discussed how it is possible to obtain a SWI\nneonatal protocol from the commonly used adult one. The main goal of this\nchapter was to implement a neonatal protocol that could be used in a clinical\nsetting. In order to test and probe a satisfactory protocol, 13 volunteer\nbabies with informed consent given by their parents where scanned on a\nPhilips 3T Achieva scanner according to local ethical approval requirements.\nThis way it was possible to test a range of repetition times between 28ms\nand 32ms as well as a range of FA between 10? and 14? in order to obtain\na good compromise between acquisition time and signal to noise ratio. This\nallowed us, after visual inspection between different exams, to obtain the\nfollowing protocol:\n\n\u2022 3D sagittal spoiled gradient echo sequence\n\n\u2022 TE = 25 ms\n\n\u2022 TR = 32 ms\n\n\u2022 Flip Angle = 12?\n\n\u2022 voxel size 0.65 mm \u00d70.65 mm \u00d70.65 mm\n\n\u2022 SENSE factor 2.1 \u00d7 2.1\n\nThis set-up allows a full 3D image of the neonatal brain with an acquisition\ntime below 5 minutes.\n\n33\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nDESPOT Versus Multi\nComponent DESPOT\n\nIn this chapter the issue of how to correctly process a set of multi-angle\nSPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimate T1 and T2 maps is covered.\nWe start be describing the implementation of a single component signal\nmodel and in section 4.1 we show how this can be used to generate test data\nwith noise added that is then fitted with a suitable model to explore the\nprecision and accuracy of the results. In section 4.2 this is extended to a 2\ncomponent model and an evaluation of its estimation precision and accuracy\nis performed. Having demonstrated some basic properties of the parameter\nestimation methods under 1 or 2 component scenarios, a systematic explo-\nration of how to optimize DESPOT is presented in chapter 5.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, along this chapter all simulations and process-\ning steps were done in MatLab 2012a environment.\n\n4.1 Estimation of T1 and T2\n\nIn order to produce a processing tool that correctly estimates T1 and T2\nfrom a given data-set, a computer model of the one compartment expected\nsignal behaviour inside a given voxel was generated. This allows us to have\na data-set with known T1 and T2 parameters that can easily be tested under\nreal-life settings.\n\nThe noise of magnitude MR images noise has been shown to follow the\nRice distribution[31, 36] (Equation 4.1)\n\nP(M) =\nM\n\n?2\nI0(\n\nAM\n\n?2\n)e\n\n(?A\n2+M2\n\n2?2\n)\n\n(4.1)\n\n34\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\nwhere, M is the apparent measured signal, A is the true signal, ? is the\nstandard deviation of the noise added to both the real and imaginary parts\nof the MR signal (which we assume to be the same) and Ii, i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,\nare the modified Bessel functions of the first kind.\n\nIn order to generate SPGR and SSFP signals with Rician noise, normal\ndistributed noise N(0,?) was added to both the real and imaginary parts of\nthe signals. Following the notation presented in section 2.3 we defined our\nnoisy model as:\n\nS\nnoisy\nSPGR = |(SPGR + i0) + (N(0,?) + iN(0,?))| (4.2)\n\nS\nnoisy\nSSFP = |(M\n\nSS\nx + iM\n\nSS\ny ) + (N(0,?) + iN(0,?))| (4.3)\n\nFigure 4.1: Example of a simulated DESPOT data-set for both white matter\n(dark blue and green curves) and gray matter (red and light blue curves). This\n\nset of signals was generated considering M0 = 1 arbitrary unit and with an added\nnoise of ? = 1 \u00d7 10?3.\n\nRecalling from section 2.3 that DESOPT1 and DESPOT2 consist of esti-\nmating T1 and T2 from a set of signal measurements over different flip angles,\nit is possible to use Equations 4.2 and 4.3 to simulate this experiment and\ncreate model fitting routines.\n\n35\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\nBased on the work presented by Stanisz et al. in 2005 [37] two sets\nof tissue relaxation times were considered in an adult brain: White mat-\nter (WM) with a T1 = 1084 ms and a T2 = 69 ms, and Gray matter\n(GM) with a T1 = 1820 ms and a T2 = 99 ms. Assuming a repetition\ntime of TR = 4.36 ms for the SPGR signal and TR = 4.567 ms (mini-\nmum TR times allowed by the scanner) for the SSFP signal and a set of\nflip angles such that ?SPGR = (3\n\n?, 4?, 5?, 6?, 7?, 9?, 13?, 18?) and ?SSFP =\n(10?, 13?, 17?, 20?, 23?, 30?, 43?, 60?)[30], for an added noise of ? = 1 \u00d7 10?3\nwith an assumed M0 = 1 it is possible to obtain the signal curves presented\nin Figure 4.1, which represent the signal variation of the SPGR and SSFP\ncurves for both white matter and gray matter (respectively dark blue, green,\nred and light blue curves) over different flip angles.\n\nFigure 4.2: This figure shows the obtained fitted model (red curves) obtained\nusing the MatLab2012a fminsearch tool superimposed over the original noisy\n\nSPGR (dark blue) and SSFP (green) data. The estimated parameters are\nT1 = 1053ms and T2 = 68ms which are close to simulated white matter values.\n\nTo derive the estimates of T1 and T2 parameters used to generate the\nsignals presented in Figure 4.1 a fit of the SPGR and SSFP models was\nperformed using MatLab2012a\u2019s \u201csimplex\u201d algorithm implemented as fmin-\nsearch tool. The cost function was defined as the minimization between the\ndifference of the model and the data, and the stopping criteria was set as\n1 \u00d7 10?6 of the obtained solution or to a maximum number of iterations of\n200 \u00d7 Number of variables. Applying this to the white matter data shown\nin Figure 4.1 we were able to obtain the fitted model presented in Figure\n4.2.\n\n36\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.3: (a) DESPOT estimation of T1 histogram, \u00b5\u00b1? = 1083 \u00b1 51ms. (b)\nDESPOT estimation of T2 histogram, \u00b5\u00b1? = 69 \u00b1 3ms. The obtained \u00b5 and ?\n\nvalues were obtained by fitting the histogram to a Rice distribution.\n\nThe obtained estimated parameters in the case presented in Figure 4.2\nwere T1 = 1053ms and T2 = 68ms which represents a T1 deviation of 2.9%\nand a T2 deviation of 1.4. One obvious question that arises is how does\nthis fitting procedure behave over a large number of noisy tests. In order to\nanswer this question Monte Carlo simulation were done where 10000 noisy\nsets where simulated and fitted. The estimated parameters histograms can\nbe seen in Figure 4.3.\n\nThe histograms presented in Figure 4.3 represent more clearly the ac-\ncuracy and precision of the fitting procedure. If we define the variation\ncoefficient as p = ?/true value then we can see that when estimating T1 we\nobtain p = 0.047 and for T2 we obtain p = 0.050, which indicates a good\nestimation precision for this method.\n\nSo far we have assumed that the SSFP signal was on resonance (offset\nfrequency band with high signal - recall Figure 2.5), however, in general\nthere is a frequency offset variation along the human brain and this factor\nneeds to be taken into account. One way to overcome this issue is to produce\ntwo sets of SSFP curves and making sure that they have a frequency offset\nshift of ?, this allows a third parameter to be estimated which tells us in\nwhich frequency position of the graph presented in Figure 2.5 we are.\n\nWith this extra parameter to fit the problem dimensionality rises to three\nunknown parameters, however we found that the \u201csimplex\u201d fminsearch tool\nstill allows an easy and precise convergence towards the right solutions, we\nwere therefore able to try this set-up in a healthy volunteer and obtain the\nT1, T2 and frequency offset (?) maps shown in Figure 4.4. This data was\n\n37\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\n4.2 Evaluation of mcDESPOT model\n\nIn the previous section the precision of the single component DESPOT model\nto estimate T1 and T2 was evaluated. In this section we evaluate the precision\nof the two-pool model proposed by Deoni et al. in 2008 [27].\n\nFigure 4.5: This figure represents the normalized SPGR (dark blue),\nSSFP-0?, 180? (red) and SSFP-0? (green). The set of parameters used to generate\n\nthese signals was: T1,F = 465ms, T1,S = 1070ms, fF = 0.2, ?F,S = 100ms\n?1,\n\nT2,F = 26ms, T2,S = 117ms,? = 0rad\n\nAs done in the previous section we start by implementing a two-pool\nsignal model over different flip angles with added normal distribution noise\nto both the real and imaginary parts of the signals in order to obtain a Rice\ndistribution after calculating the image magnitude. This two-pool model ex-\npands the problem dimensionality from three unknown parameters to seven\nunknown parameters, making the fitting procedure much harder and requires\nmore creative approaches to obtain the correct estimation of parameters.\n\nWe first start by simulating the two-pool model. For reproducibility\nreasons we chose the set of parameters presented by Deoni et al. in their\n2008 paper [27]. After this, the SPGR and the SSFP signals are normal-\nized relative to their respective mean value (the SSFP-0? and SSFP-0?, 180?\n\nwere considered coupled and the mean signal over all SSFP flip angles was\nconsidered in order to reduced noise scaling - Figure 4.5). This is done in\norder to avoid fitting for M0 and reduce the dimensionality of the problem.\n\n39\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\nFor the two-pool model we found that the \u201csimplex\u201d fitting procedure\nno longer converged to a solution with the desired accuracy and precision.\nTo overcome this issue a more creative approach was designed in order to\nguarantee a correct estimation. When running optimization routines on non-\nlinear search spaces, the starting point is a crucial factor towards finding\na correct solution. In order to make sure the best solution was obtained a\ndictionary was generated over a grid of physiologically meaningful relaxation\nparameters. Using an orthogonal matching pursuit approach [38, 39] we\nwere able to select of parameters that best explain the collected data. This\nset of starting point candidates where then rank-ordered by a least-squares\ncriteria, and the best 100 candidates were used as starting points for a non-\nlinear least-squares optimization, MatLab 2012a routine lsqnonlin tool. We\nthen picked the rank-ordered obtained solutions by a least-squares difference\ncriteria in order to select the solution that better explained the data as the\ncorrect one.\n\nFigure 4.6: Example of the obtained fit solution (red) plotted against the\nsimulated SPGR (green), SSFP-0? (dark blue)and SSFP-0?, 180? (black). The\n\ncorrect solution is also shown in light blue. The obtained solution is:\nT1,F = 465ms, T1,S = 1070ms, fF = 0.20, ?F,S = 100ms, T2,F = 26ms,\n\nT2,S = 117ms and ? = 1.6 \u00d7 10?6rad.\n\nIn order to test this fitting procedure we first applied it to a practically\nnoiseless case (added ? = 1\u00d710?7) and we realised that the fitting procedure\n\n40\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\nwas able to find the correct solution (Figure 4.6).\n\nFigure 4.7: Example of the obtained fit solution (red) plotted against the\nsimulated SPGR (green), SSFP-0? (dark blue) and SSFP-0?, 180? (black). The\n\ncorrect solution is also show in light blue. The obtained solution is:\nT1,F = 769ms, T1,S = 1055ms, fF = 0.62, ?F,S = 659ms, T2,F = 53ms,\n\nT2,S = 151ms and ? = ?0.0002rad.\n\nThe next step was to try and apply this same procedure to a data-set\nwith a small amount of noise added (? = 1 \u00d7 10?4). Figure 4.7 shows the\nresult for that fitting procedure. As can be seen the correct answer was\nno longer found, however what is very concerning is that the curves of the\nfitted model, and of the correct model are practically overlapping. In or-\nder to assess this, it was decided to try and visualize how the cost-function\nsearch space behaves along a straight line that connects the 100 best found\nsolutions and the correct answer. The results are shown in Figure 4.8 and it\nis astonishing to see that no significant differences seen between the found\nsolutions and the correct solution.\n\nLooking carefully at Figure 4.8 it can be seen that the found solutions\ngive a lower cost-function value than the correct answer, which suggests that\nthis is an intrinsic problem of the model and not of the way we are searching\nfor the correct parameter estimates.\n\nThese results agree with what is discussed in the paper published by\n\n41\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT\n\nFigure 4.8: Representation of the mcDESPOT search-space topography along\nlines between the 100 best found solutions (? = 0) and the correct answer\n\n(? = 100). The found solutions are ordered from the best found solution (left) to\nthe worse found solution (right). The color-bar represents the cost-function values\n\nscaled from the lowest obtained value to the highest.\n\nChristopher L. Lankford and Mark D. Does in 2013 [31]. This paper sug-\ngests that mcDESPOT-derived estimates of tissue parameters do not have\nenough precision to be related to specific tissue characteristics. Their re-\nsults indicate that previously published results, may have used data fitting\nmethods that implicitly constrained parameter solution, or that the two-\npool model may not be sufficient to describe the observed SPGR and SSFP\nsignals.\n\nIn 2012 Deoni et al. proposed a three-pool mcDESPOT model, stating\nthat it should be able to more precisely estimate water-pool parameters,\nhowever it was decided that this approach would make the fitting procedure\neven more difficult and was not relevant to follow this even more complex\nmodel line of thought within the scope of this work. Rather, it was decided\nto implement a framework to explore systematically a set of flip angles that\nguarantee a low estimation variance over different tissue parameters.\n\n42\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nOptimizing DESPOT\n\nIn the previous chapter it was discussed how to implement the standard\nDESPOT and mcDESPOT protocol and an assessment was done of the ac-\ncuracy and precision of both methods.\n\nIn their 2013 paper[31], Christopher L. Lankford and Mark D. Does,\nused a statistical tool known as the Crame?r-Rao Lower bound (CRLB) as a\nway to predict the minimum possible variance one can obtain when estimat-\ning parameters using the mcDESPOT two-pool model. The CRLB has been\nused in previous work as an optimization tool for MR protocols[36, 40, 41].\nIn this chapter we adapted this statistical tool to both verify and optimize\nthe DESPOT protocol precision and accuracy.\n\nOne important question that arises is how can the CRLB be computed\nand once this is done, how can we use it as an optimization tool for our\nprotocol? These are the main issues which are discussed in the following\nsections.\n\n5.1 Crame?r-Rao Lower Bound - Gaussian noise\n\nThe most common way to derive the CRLB is assuming a Gaussian dis-\ntributed noise level[31, 36]. Following the notation presented in [31], if we\nassume a model g(x,?), where x ?&lt;N is an independent parameter vector\n(for what this work is concerned the flip angles) and ? ?&lt;M is a vector of\nmodel parameters (T1 and T2). Considering a set of N noisy observations\ny ?<N from which we obtain a random estimate ??, the estimated parameter\nvector covariance matrix is bounded by:\n\n?\n??\n?\n?E[??]\n\n??\nF?1\n\n?E[??]\n\n??\n\nT\n\n(5.1)\n\n43\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\nwhere, F is the Fisher information matrix (FIM), E[.] is the expectation\noperator, and the derivative of one vector with respect to another follows\nthe convention (?a/?b)ij ? ?ai/?bj.\n\nThe FIM is a matrix built from the parameter vector ? log-likelihood\nhyper-surface (L) curvature[31]. Which in the case of Gaussian distributed\nnoise of the observed data yi, i = 1, 2, 3, ...,N simplifies into [31, 36, 42]:\n\nFjk = E(\n?2L\n\n??j??k\n) =\n\nN?\ni=1\n\n(\n1\n\n?2i\n\n?gi\n??j\n\n?gi\n??k\n\n) (5.2)\n\nIn Equation 5.1 the CRLB also includes the estimator gradient matrix,\nhowever for unbiased estimators this term reduces to an identity matrix.\nUnless stated otherwise, along this work this unbiased condition is consid-\nered true and therefore ?E[??]/?? is considered to be the identity matrix.\n\nBecause all signals are considered to be magnitude signals, and we add\nGaussian distributed noise to both the real and imaginary signal compo-\nnents, the resulting measured signal noise follows a Rician distribution. This\nmeans that the Gaussian CRLB model is only valid for signals with inten-\nsities at least two times bigger than the noise floor [31], therefore we found\ninstructive to estimate the CRLB assuming also a Rice distribution of the\nnoise model. A small overview of how this is achieved is discussed in the\nnext section.\n\n5.2 Crame?r-Rao Lower Bound - Rician noise\n\nThe Rice distribution follows the distribution shown in equation 4.1. The\nlog-likelihood of a set of N measurements can therefore be expressed as:\n\nL =\nN?\ni=1\n\n[log Mi ? 2 log ? + log I0(\nAiMi\n?2\n\n) ?\nA2i + M\n\n2\ni\n\n2?2\n] (5.3)\n\nWith this in mind the FIM may be computed by:\n\nFjk = E(\n?2L\n\n??j??k\n) =\n\n? ?\n0\n\n?2L\n\n??j??k\nP(M)dM (5.4)\n\nwhich according to [36] can be expressed as:\n\nE(\n?2L\n\n??j??k\n) =\n\nN?\ni=1\n\n1\n\n?4\n?Ai\n??j\n\n?Ai\n??k\n\n(Zk ?A2k) (5.5)\n\n44\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\nwhere,\n\nZk =\n\n? ?\n0\n\nA2iI\n2\n1 (\nAiM\n\n?2\n)I?20 (\n\nAiM\n\n?2\n)P(M)dM (5.6)\n\nThe function Zk must be numerically computed, since it does not have a\nclosed form. Also, as suggested in [36], a look-up table was pre-computed\nand linear interpolation was used to assess Zk values in order to save com-\nputing time and resources.\n\n5.3 Selection of optimized Flip Angle set\n\nThe main goal of the work presented in this chapter is to optimize the\nDESPOT protocol by selecting in a rigorous way the combination of flip\nangles that allow us to obtain the lowest estimation variance possible.\n\n5.3.1 Defining Cost Function\n\nIn order to find a set of N flip angles that minimizes the predicted CRLB\nand at the same time ensure that the relative precision of each parameter\n(T1,T2) is equally weighted, we normalize the CRLB of each parameter by\nits respective squared value. As the brain has a heterogeneous range of T1\nand T2 values that we wish to optimize for. We consider a cost function\nthat computes the CRLB over a T1 and T2 grid and selects the combination\nof parameters that gives the highest CRLB. Minimizing the output of this\ncost function guarantees the optimization of the worst case scenario in each\nstep of the optimization procedure[42].\n\n5.3.2 Simulated Annealing\n\nSimulated annealing is an optimization routine that is known to be suitable\nfor large scale problems, since it doesn\u2019t rely on gradient estimation to find\na global minimum solution.\n\nThis method is inspired on thermodynamics, more specifically on how\nmetals cool and anneal, or liquids freeze and crystallize. At high temper-\natures, the liquid molecules are able to freely move with respect to each\nother, however when the temperature drops slowly, this mobility is lost.\nDuring this process the atoms are able to line themselves and form a pure\ncrystal (lowest energy state). Mimicking this natural process is the heart\nof simulated annealing. This process can be modelled by the Boltzmann\ndistribution,\n\nP(E) ? e?E/kT (5.7)\n\n45\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\nwhich describes the idea that a system in thermal equilibrium at a temper-\nature T has a probability to be distributed over different energy states E.\nThis allows the systems to leave low energy states (local minima) in favour\nof finding better ones (global minima)[43].\n\nThis optimization routine is implemented in MatLab2012a optimization\ntoolbox optimtool, and was used to evaluate the previously discussed cost\nfunction in order to find a set of flip angles that allow low T1 and T2 esti-\nmation variances.\n\n5.3.3 Verifying the CRLB\n\nOne important first step is to verify if the predicted bound agrees with the\nfitting procedure implemented. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed in\norder to compare the predicted bound with the obtained fit standard devi-\nation over a large number of trials.\n\nThe Rice distribution is known to converge towards a Gaussian distribu-\ntion for SNR > 3 [44], and therefore for simplicity we assumed the Gaussian\ndistributed CRLB. Because this model does not assume the data is normal-\nized prior to the fitting procedure, in order to maintain equity between\nobtained standard deviation and predicted CRLB, the data was fitted with-\nout the normalization step, and M0 was considered as an extra parameter.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation was set-up as followed: 10000 noisy SPGR\nand SSFP-0?, 180? trails were generated. Correct knowledge of ? was con-\nsidered since it can be assessed with B0 mapping techniques. The considered\nparameters were ? = 1 \u00d7 10?3, M0 = 1, T1 = 1083ms and T2 = 69ms. The\nsimulated data was fitted using fminsearch tool for M0, T1 and T2 parame-\nters using the correct answer as the starting point. The obtained histograms\nand predicted CRLB can be seen in Figure 5.1. This Figure shows that\nthe CRLB and the obtained histograms standard deviation are in excellent\nagreement and therefore the CRLB can be used as a means to predict the\nparameter estimation error given a set of parameters.\n\nOnce this was verified, the CRLB was used to select an optimized set of\nFA that would give a good compromise between parameter estimation error\nand acquisition time. Using the approach described in section 5.3.1 a grid\nof expected WM and GM parameters expected in the neonatal brain was\nconsidered. T1,WM ? T1,GM = [2300; 2700] ? [1600; 2000]ms in increments\nof 50ms and T2,WM ?T2,GM = [20; 200]ms in increments of 20ms [35]. The\noptimization was performed for sets of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, and 4 FA. Each\nset had equal number of SPGR and SSFP measurements. The optimized\n\n46\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\nFigure 5.1: This Figure show the CRLB predicted distribution (red) versus the\nobtained histograms from the Monte Carlo simulations (blue), for T1 (top), T2\n\n(middle) and M0 (bottom).\n\nset of 16 FA is:\n\n\u2022 SPGR:4.60?, 5.32?, 5.51?, 5.86?, 6.14?, 6.88?, 9.93?, 21.47?\n\n\u2022 SSFP:6.67?, 14.97?, 16.24?, 20.12?, 22.80?, 23.70?, 33.63?, 84.87?\n\nIn order to compare the optimized FA with the original set, the predicted\nprecision (CRLB/TrueV alue) for both T1 and T2 was plotted over a grid\nof relaxation times (Figure 5.2). It can be seen that the optimized FA guar-\nantee a lower CRLB over the range of relaxation times when compared with\nthe original set. Looking more carefully at the obtained set of FA it is strik-\ning to see some of them are very close together, perhaps suggesting that the\nactual number of measurements can be reduced without strongly affecting\nthe estimation precision. In fact, performing the optimization with only 2\nSPGR (optimized to:5.7? and 7.3?) and 3 SSFP (optimized to:14.3?, 24.0?\n\n47\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\nand 60.0?) measurements still allows a predicted precision bellow 10% (Fig-\nure 5.3).\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 5.2: This figure shows how the estimated precision (precision\np = ?2/T21,2, where red represents worse precision and dark blue best brecision\nobtained over the grid) and T2((b) and (d)) changes over a grid of T1 and T2\n\nparameters ranging from 1600ms to 2800ms (horizontal axis) and 20ms to 300ms\n(vertical axis) respectively. (a)(b) Gold-standard set-up. (c)(d) Optimized set-up.\n\nFigure 5.3 shows that even with only 5 FA the model only has estimation\nerrors larger than 10% for very high T1 and low T2 parameters.\n\nThe results shown so far indicate that the DESPOT1 and DESPOT2\nset-up can be optimized using the CRLB. Picking the correct set of FA al-\nlows estimation of T1 and T2 parameters with an error bellow 10% with only\n2 SPGR and 2 SSFP measurements.\n\nIt must be noticed that this optimization set-up is too simplistic, as in\na clinical scanner the MR system performs internal receive and transmit\ncalibrations at the beginning of each acquisition sequence resulting in dif-\nferent gain factors that may corrupt the estimation and should be taken\n\n48\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.3: (a) T1 and (b) T2 estimation precision (precision p = ?\n2/T21,2, where\n\nred represents worse precision and dark blue best brecision obtained over the grid)\nwith two SPGR flip angles (5.7? and 7.5?) and three SSFP (14.3?, 24.0? and\n60.0?) over a grid of T1(horizontal axis) and T2 (vertical axis) parameters.\n\ninto account. This issue is usually overcome by normalizing the data by its\nrespective mean, therefore one way to further improve this work would be\nto develop and implement a normalized signal CRLB model.\n\n49\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThis work has described how to apply advance MR techniques to image the\nneonatal brain.\n\nIn Chapter 3 it was discussed how to adapt standard adult SWI protocol\nto the neonatal brain. The goal was to create a SWI capability for use on\nneonatal brain. This involved proposing a dedicated neonatal protocol, in-\ncluding a re-evaluation of the effect of varying slice thickness and developing\na GUI to allow users to produce filtered images that emphasise susceptibility\neffects from raw SWI data. The developed GUI will allow future systematic\nclinical testing and further explore some of the issues intrinsic to this type of\nMR imaging. Also we demonstrated that voxel size plays a very important\nrole when SWI is concerned and that for isotropic ratios it should be taken\ninto account not only positive phase information but also negative phase\ninformation. This however was not systematically evaluated and should be\nexplored in future work.\n\nWithin Chapter 4 it was described how to correctly process a set of\nmulti-angle SPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimate T1 and T2 for both\na one compartment and two compartment models. We concluded that the\nsingle pool model can correctly estimate parameters with a precision around\n5%. We were not able to obtain satisfying results from the two-pool model\napproach and decided that further work on the topic would not be impor-\ntant for the scope of this project.\n\nIn Chapter 5 the use of the CRLB as an optimization tool for DESPOT\nwas discussed. Along this chapter we showed that the CRLB is in good\nagreement with the obtained estimation standard deviation from Monte\nCarlo simulations. Further we showed that it can be used to optimize the\nDESPOT acquisition protocol for a range of T1 and T2 parameters. We also\nconcluded that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of FA samples\n\n50\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nwithout significantly affecting the estimation of T1 and T2 precision.\n\nIn the end of this project both SWI and DESPOT, have been set-up with\ntechnical testing that provides the basis for full scale tests of the methods\non neonatal subjects.\n\n51\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] E.
