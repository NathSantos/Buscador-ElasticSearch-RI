EG is frequently reported \nin humans (MORETTI et al., 2006; ZHOU et al., \n2014) with few reports in dogs (MCTAVISH, 2002; \nFONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). The condition can \naffect multiple segments of the digestive system \nconcomitantly or individually, causing distinct \ngastrointestinal clinical manifestations (HSU \n&amp; LO, 1998; MCTAVISH, 2002; TEMIZ et al., \n2012; FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). Scirrhous \neosinophilic gastritis (SEG) is a subtype of EG \ncharacterized by diffuse infiltration of eosinophils \nand concomitant fibrous tissue proliferation in \nthe stomach wall (HAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN, \n1977). The condition has unknown cause, and \nthere are few studies describing this type of EG in \ndogs (HAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). Dogs \naffected by SEG show clinical signs similar to those \npresented by dogs with chronic gastrointestinal \ndiseases (MCTAVISH, 2002).

On clinical examination, the dog \npresented marked cachexia, apathy and melena. \nThe blood cell count revealed marked eosinophilia \n(4936mm-3, reference values (RV): 100 to \n1240mm-3), marked decreased hemoglobin (3.8g \ndL-1, RV: 12 to 18g dL-1) and decreased hematocrit \n(15%, RV: 37 to 55%). Serum biochemistry showed \nreduced albumin (15.33g L-1, RV: 26 to 33g L-1). \nAbdominal ultrasonography examination revealed \nthickening of the gastric wall (2.8cm), and the \nspleen was enlarged and multinodular with irregular \nborders. Dog 2 was a six year old male, mixed-breed, \nwith a history of weight loss, anorexia and vomiting \nfor 30 days and melena for three days. On physical \nexamination the dog presented marked cachexia, \ndehydration and pale mucous membranes. Blood cell \ncount revealed eosinophilia (2400mm-3), decreased \nhemoglobin (10.8g dL-1) and decreased hematocrit \n(31%). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed that \nthe gastric wall was 1.9cm thick, and the spleen was \nenlarged with irregular borders. Based on the clinical \nand ultrasonography examination in both of the \ncases, a presumptive diagnosis of gastric neoplasia \nor chronic gastritis was established. Euthanasia was \nperformed in both of the cases due to a deteriorating \nquality of life and poor prognosis.\n\nThe dogs were necropsied, and the tissue \nsamples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral \nbuffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at \n5\u00b5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). \nSections of the stomach and spleen were also stained \nwith Masson\u2019s trichrome (MT), Periodic acid-Schiff \n(PAS) and Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver (GMS).\n\nAt necropsy, both of the dogs presented \nsimilar lesions. The stomach was markedly enlarged \nwith hemorrhages on the serosa (Figure 1A), and \nthe stomach wall was diffusely thickened (2 to \n4cm). On the cut surface the gastric wall was firm, \nwhite to yellow with multifocal small cystic areas \n(Figure 1B). The gastric mucosa presented multiple \nulcerations ranging from 0.2 to 1cm in diameter. \nThe spleens were markedly enlarged, showing a \nmultinodular aspect with white, firm tissue on the \ncapsule (Figure 1C). The other viscera were normal.\n\nHistological evaluation of the stomach of \nboth dogs revealed transmural eosinophilic infiltration, \nwhich was severe in the mucosa and submucosa \nlayers and mild in the muscular and serosa layers. The \n\nsubmucosa also presented marked fibrous connective \ntissue proliferation (evidenced with MT stain) and \nneovascularization (Figure 1D-E). Dog 1\u2019s stomach \nalso presented discrete mast cells and Mott cell \ninfiltration, multifocal areas of necrosis in the mucosa \nwith neutrophil infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis \nof submucosal arteries (evidenced by PAS stain). \nSplenic lesions consisted of connective fibrous tissue \nproliferation, multifocal areas of hemorrhage, arterial \nfibrinoid necrosis and moderate multifocal infiltrating \ninflammatory cells composed of numerous eosinophils, \nmoderate plasma cells, foamy macrophages and Mott \ncells (Figure 1F). Mild eosinophilic infiltration in \nthe duodenum and liver of dog 1 was also observed. \nThe GMS stain did not show fungal structures in the \nstomach and spleen of either dog 1 or 2.\n\nSEG is a subtype of EG that affects dogs \nand is a rare occurrence with few cases described \n(HAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). The diagnosis \nof SEG in the cases reported here was based on clinical \nsigns, blood count, ultrasonography examination, \nnecropsy and histopathological findings (HSU &amp; LO, \n1998; FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012).\n\nIn humans, EG is defined based on the \nfollowing criteria: 1) gastrointestinal tract symptoms; \n2) eosinophilic infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract \n(more than 20 eosinophils per high power field); and \n3) exclusion of other general causes of eosinophilia \n(parasitic infestations, connective tissue disease, \nhypereosinophilic syndrome, lymphoma and other \nintestinal tumors, primary amyloidosis and celiac \ndisease (HSU &amp; LO, 1998; PENNINCK, 2005). \nClinical signs, laboratory test results and post-mortem \nfindings of both cases reported are according to the \ncriteria above mentioned. \n\nThe cause of EG is not elucidated; however, \nfood allergens, hypersensitivity reactions and \nparasite migration are suggested as etiologies in dogs \n(HAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977; FONSECA-\nALVES et al., 2012). Some of the gastrointestinal \nparasites that may cause EG in humans and dogs \nare Ancylostoma caninum, Ascaris lumbricoides, \nTrichuris trichiura and Toxocara canis (HONG et al., \n2003; CHIRA et al., 2005). Dog\u2019s owners reported no \nhistory of hypersensitivity reactions, and the dogs did \nnot present gastrointestinal parasites at necropsy. The \netiology of SEG in these cases thus remains uncertain.\n\nClinical signs presented by the dogs \ncorroborate with those previously reported in other \ncases of EG in dogs (MCTAVISH, 2002; FONSECA-\nALVES et al., 2012). Vomiting, weight loss and \nabdominal discomfort are usually observed early in \nthe disease course, while tenesmus, hematochezia \n\n\n\nScirrhous eosinophilic gastritis in two dogs.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.46, n.5, mai, 2016.\n\n883\n\nand melena are observed in the latter stages as the \ndisease progresses. In both cases reported here, the \nhematochezia and melena resulted in anemia, which \nwas severe in dog 1 because it was presented to the \nveterinary in a later stage of the disease, presenting \nsevere gastric ulcers. Based on the clinical and \nultrasound examination, in both cases the presumptive \ndiagnosis was gastric neoplasm. When there is a \nmarked thickening of the gastric wall, inflammatory \ndiseases of the gastrointestinal tract may mimic \ninfiltrative neoplasms (PENNINCK, 2005).\n\nHypereosinophilia is a common finding \nin cases of EG in humans and dogs (HSU &amp; LO., \n1998; MORETTI et al., 2006; TEMIZ et al., 2012; \nFONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). Low albumin \nlevels in the blood of dog 1 may be associated with \nthe loss of appetite, vomiting and malabsorption due \nto gastric lesions. \n\nIn other cases of SEG, the gastric wall \nthickness ranged from 2 to 2,5cm (HAYDEN &amp; \nFLEISCHMAN, 1977). In both dogs, the stomach \nwall was diffusely thickened, affecting the \n\nFigure 1 - Scirrhous eosinophilic gastritis in dogs. A.

HAYDEN &amp; \nFLEISCHMAN (1977) and RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al. \n(l995) reported marked thickening in the fundic \nregion, while FONSECA-ALVES et al. (2012) \nfound that the stomach wall was only thickened \nin the pyloric region. As in the cases we report, \nHAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN (1977) described an \nenlarged and nodular spleen; however, the splenic \nlesion physiopathology is not clear.\n\nHistologically, eosinophilic infiltration was \nobserved in the stomach, spleen (dog 1 and  2), duodenum \nand liver (dog 1). The stomach and duodenum are the \nmost affected gastrointestinal segments in the cases of \nEG in dogs and humans (HAYDEN &amp; FLEISCHMAN, \n1977; MORETTI et al., 2006; FONSECA-ALVES et \nal., 2012). Eosinophil infiltration in the gastrointestinal \ntract is mainly observed in the mucosa and submucosa \n(25-100%) followed by the muscle layers (13-70%) \nand serosa (10-40%) (KHAN, 2005). In humans, EG \nis histologically classified into mucosal, muscular, and \nsubserosal (RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 1995). In the cases \ndescribed, the stomach lesions were transmural. \n\nIn this report, EG was classified as \n\u201cscirrhous\u201d due to the marked fibrovascular tissue \nproliferation observed in the gastric wall (HAYDEN \n&amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). SEG should be considered \nin the differential diagnosis of tumor-like lesions that \npresent eosinophil infiltration in the stomach wall \nincluding gastric pythiosis (TROST et al., 2009) and \ngastric mast cell tumors. The diagnosis of gastric \npythiosis was excluded because no fungal structures \nwere observed upon GMS staining. The stomach of dog \n1 presented some mast cell infiltration, but these cells \ndid not present malignant features. Histopathological \nexamination allowed the differentiation of SEG from \nother disorders that cause gastrointestinal signs and \nstomach wall thickening associated with eosinophil \ninfiltration in dogs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nTo Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico \ne Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) and Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de \nPessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCHIRA, O. et al.
