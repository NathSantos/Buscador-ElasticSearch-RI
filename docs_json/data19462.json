The uncertainties inherent to production \n\nare related to the uncertainties in the physical state of the reservoir and external variables. \n\nReservoir uncertainty can be reduced as new production and dynamic data become available. 4D \n\nseismic technology has been used in the petroleum industry because the integration of geophysics \n\nand engineering information increases the predictive capability of reservoir simulations. \n\nHowever, there are technical issues to be addressed before starting a 4D seismic project. Several \n\ngeophysical studies use the chance of success concept to identify the favorable cases; evaluating \n\nthe seismic survey and the magnitude of seismic changes. From the engineering point of view, it \n\nis important to evaluate the impact of new information on field operations and the consequent \n\nmonetary benefit. The estimation of 4D seismic data chance of success before its acquisition is a \n\nchallenge. Therefore, the thesis presents a methodology to estimate the chance of success of a 4D \n\nseismic project from the reservoir engineering perspective. The methodology was developed in \n\nthree phases. The first phase shows that water saturation error can measure the improvement on \n\nthe fluid behavior understanding due to 4D seismic data. Moreover, it shows that the time for 4D \n\nseismic data acquisition affects its value. The second phase presents the methodology to estimate \n\nthe best time to acquire 4D seismic data. The best time estimation is determined by evaluating \n\ntime for water breakthrough and the water saturation error curves. Finally, the chance of success \n\nmethodology is presented. The methodology is simple and an iterative process. It is divided in six \n\nsteps, in which some of them are well established in the literature. The thesis incorporates the \n\ndate of 4D seismic data acquisition in the process and assesses the chance of success through the \n\nvariation in the economic benefit caused by the reservoir uncertainties. The methodology was \n\napplied to a synthetic reservoir model, showing a procedure to estimate the expected value of \n\ninformation and the probability of success.  \n\n \n\nKey Word: 4D Seismic, Reservoir Simulation, Chance of Success, Value of Information.  \n\n\n\nxiv \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos \u00e9 um neg\u00f3cio que envolve muitos riscos. As incertezas inerentes \n\n\u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e3o relacionadas \u00e0s incertezas no estado f\u00edsico do reservat\u00f3rio e vari\u00e1veis externas. \n\nA incerteza do reservat\u00f3rio pode ser reduzida conforme dados de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e din\u00e2micos s\u00e3o \n\nadquiridos. A s\u00edsmica 4D (S4D) tem sido utilizada na ind\u00fastria de petr\u00f3leo, pois a integra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o geof\u00edsica e de engenharia aumenta a capacidade preditiva da simula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nreservat\u00f3rios. Entretanto, h\u00e1 quest\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas que devem ser avaliadas antes de se iniciar um \n\nprojeto de S4D. V\u00e1rios estudos geof\u00edsicos usam o conceito de chance de sucesso para identificar \n\nos casos favor\u00e1veis onde s\u00e3o avaliados o levantamento s\u00edsmico e a magnitude das mudan\u00e7as \n\ns\u00edsmicas. Por\u00e9m, do ponto de vista de engenharia \u00e9 importante avaliar o impacto da nova \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o na opera\u00e7\u00e3o do campo e o consequente benef\u00edcio financeiro. A estimativa da chance \n\nde sucesso de um projeto de S4D \u00e9 um desafio. Portanto, este trabalho apresenta uma \n\nmetodologia que estima a chance de sucesso sob a perspectiva da engenharia de reservat\u00f3rios. A \n\nmetodologia foi desenvolvida em tr\u00eas fases. A primeira fase mostra que o erro de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1gua pode ser utilizado para medir a melhora no entendimento da movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos no \n\nreservat\u00f3rio devido \u00e0 aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da S4D. Al\u00e9m disso, mostra que o momento em que a s\u00edsmica 4D \n\n\u00e9 adquirida impacta no valor da informa\u00e7\u00e3o. Na segunda fase a metodologia para determinar o \n\nmelhor momento para a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da S4D \u00e9 apresentada. O melhor momento \u00e9 determinado \n\navaliando o tempo para a chegada de \u00e1gua nos po\u00e7os e as curvas de erro de satura\u00e7\u00e3o. Por fim, a \n\nmetodologia para a estimativa da chance de sucesso \u00e9 apresentada. A metodologia \u00e9 um processo \n\niterativo simples. A metodologia \u00e9 composta por seis etapas, no qual algumas s\u00e3o bem \n\nestabelecidas na literatura. A tese incorpora a data que aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da s\u00edsmica 4D no processo e \n\navalia a chance de sucesso por meio da varia\u00e7\u00e3o do beneficio econ\u00f4mico ocasionado pelas \n\nincertezas do reservat\u00f3rio. A metodologia foi aplicada para um caso sint\u00e9tico para ilustrar o \n\nprocedimento do c\u00e1lculo do valor da informa\u00e7\u00e3o e da probabilidade de sucesso. \n\n \n\nPalavras Chave: S\u00edsmica 4D, Simula\u00e7\u00e3o de Reservat\u00f3rios, Chance de Sucesso, Valor da \n\nInforma\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n\n\nxvi \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxvii \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n4D seismic is increasingly being used as qualitative and quantitative description of the \n\nreservoir behavior for management and decisions making purposes. 4D seismic refers to \n\nrepeating seismic acquisition over time. It provides unique information regarding the dynamic \n\nproperties variations (such as pressure and saturation changes) due to production.  \n\n4D seismic is used to constrain or update a model of the reservoir, to locate undrained oil, \n\nto optimize well planning and minimize the effect of unexpected events, such as an early \n\nbreakthrough of injected fluids. Knowledge of reservoir connectivity, flow barriers, or bypassed \n\nhydrocarbons is the kind of information that is expected from 4D seismic data (Waggoner, 1998 \n\nand Kawar et al., 2003).  \n\nSuch knowledge helps to optimize reservoir investment decisions and increases the average \n\nrecovery. Due to the actual complexity of the reservoirs, the current average recovery is about \n\n35%. 4D seismic is an important contribution to increase the recovery factor (Oldenziel, 2003).  \n\nStatoil states that 4D seismic contributes to reach the ambition of increasing the oil \n\nrecovery rate to 60% on the Norwegian shelf. A permanent seismic tool will be used to increase \n\nthe recovery rate; 700 kilometers of seismic cables will be installed on the seabed on the Snorre \n\nand Grane fields in the North Sea (Statoil, 2014). \n\nRegarding the Brazilian oil fields, 4D seismic has an important role in the Marlim field \n\nmanagement. The integration of 4D seismic and production data provided a more realistic \n\nreservoir model and assisted the optimization of well planning: two wells were canceled, five \n\nnew wells were drilled and many wells were repositioned. The total oil production increased \n\n4.76% and the production per well increased 24%. Most of the improvement can be attributed to \n\nthe 4D seismic interpretation (Johann et al., 2009). \n\nSeveral published cases show that 4D seismic can improve reservoir management and \n\nincrease production efficiency. The following fields can be mentioned: Marlim Sul in Campos \n\nBasin; Gulfaks in the North Sea; Oseberg, Heidrun and Ekofisk in Norway (Thedy et al., 2007; \n\nRoste et al., 2006; Sando et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nHowever, the use of 4D seismic data to monitor carbonate reservoirs in the published \n\nliterature is limited. The time-lapse monitoring in carbonate reservoir is a challenge, because the \n\nacoustic response is highly variable and there is some debate about the applicability of \n\nGassmann\u2019s equation (Chen et al., 2008; Guimar\u00e3es, 2013). \n\n4D seismic can be used with commercial advantage in reservoir monitoring; but it is \n\nnecessary to identify the favorable cases before starting a project. Many of the existing \n\napproaches focus on the geophysical issues of comparing two 3D images. The main objective is \n\nto verify if it will be possible to detect changes in the seismic response. Without a meaningful \n\ntime-lapse change, there is no useful information derived from 4D seismic processing \n\n(Waggoner, 1998). \n\nBehrens et al. (2001) present the key elements of a successful 4D seismic project: \n\nfeasibility, acquisition, processing and interpretation. Feasibility analysis is performed to evaluate \n\nseismic data ability to identify changes in the reservoir during production. It comprises two \n\nfactors: detectability and repeatability.  \n\nDetectability is the amount of change in the elastic properties of the reservoir associated \n\nwith production. The detectability is determined by evaluating the following characteristics: \n\n? Reservoir: depth, net pressure, bubble point, temperature, thickness of the reservoir zone \n\nto be monitored; \n\n? Rock: dry bulk modulus and porosity; \n\n? Fluid: gas oil ratio, salinity, fluid saturation change, fluid compressibility contrast; \n\n? Seismic: dominant seismic frequency, average resolution, image quality, fluid contact \n\nvisibility, travel time change, impedance change. \n\n \n\nThe repeatability is a measure of similarity of the seismic response between two or more \n\nseismic surveys. The optimal 4D seismic imaging requires seismic acquisition and processing to \n\nbe \u201crepeatable\u201d from survey to survey, so that differences between time-lapse images can be \n\n\u201ctrusted\u201d.  \n\nEnhanced acquisition repeatability includes using the same acquisition method for each \n\nsurvey, accurate source and receiver positioning, shooting seismic lines in the same direction and \n\nusing the same bin spacing and offset (Lumley, 1998).  \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nUnwanted differences in the amplitude and timing of seismic reflections can be created by \n\ndifferences in seismic acquisition and processing. In order to interpret amplitude and time \n\ndifferences created by the changes in the reservoir properties it is necessary to minimize these \n\neffects.  \n\nSome of the acquisition effects on 4D seismic data are reduced by minimized streamer \n\ncable feather, improved design of ocean-bottom and land positioning methods, and installation of \n\npermanently emplaced receiver arrays. Regarding to the processing phase, the goal is to obtain \n\nexcellent 3D seismic images for each data set, and simultaneously optimize time-lapse \n\nrepeatability in regions of no subsurface change (Behrens et al.,2001 and Lumley, 2001). \n\nInterpretation of 4D seismic data can be subdivided into qualitative and quantitative. \n\nQualitative interpretation recognizes where changes detected by seismic are happening, but only \n\ninfers the significance of those changes. Quantitative interpretation attempts to quantify those \n\nchanges in seismic properties to reservoir properties. \n\nFrom the moment that 4D seismic is considered feasible in the geophysical approach, it is \n\nnecessary to evaluate whether the acquisition of new information will be useful for field \n\nmanagement. \n\nTwo are the benefits that 4D seismic data can bring to the field management. It mitigates \n\nthe risk and increases the economic value of the project. The combination of 4D seismic and well \n\ndata enormously reduces reservoir uncertainty; however, the information increases the economic \n\nvalue only if it influences decisions (Pickering, 2003 and Kawar, 2003).  \n\nMarques (2012) presents a method to quantify the risk mitigation. The risk is associated \n\nwith the net present value variability. The variability is measured using the standard deviation. \n\nThe value of information (VOI) quantifies the increase in the economic value of the project. \n\nThe value of 4D seismic data is simpler to determine after data acquisition, because the impact on \n\nfield operations is known. The VOI estimation before data acquisition is more complex due to the \n\nmany possibilities that can come from the process; it may require several simplifications to make \n\nthe process viable.  \n\nThe literature does not distinguish between the terminologies used to define the value of \n\ninformation calculated before or after data acquisition. Thus, the thesis considers that the value \n\ncalculated after and before data acquisition are termed: value of information (VOI) and expected \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nvalue of information (EVOI), respectively. The inclusion of the word expected is necessary \n\nbecause the value calculated is a weighted measure.  \n\nThe expected value of 4D seismic data depends on four factors presented in Figure 1.1. \n\nThese factors should be included in the EVOI analysis and are described as follows: \n\n(1) Date of acquisition: the amount of useful information that can be obtained is related to the \n\nreservoir fluid flow which is variable over the production period; \n\n(2) Impact on field management: the provided information should impact on field operations \n\nand generate more monetary benefit than the cost of its acquisition; \n\n(3) Reservoir uncertainties: if there is a high level of confidence in the reservoir \n\ncharacterization, there is no need of additional costs due to the acquisition of new \n\ninformation; \n\n(4) Other source of data: several potential sources of information can improve the decision \n\nmaking process and reduce the reservoir uncertainty. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Factors that influence the expected value of 4D seismic data. \n\n \n\nThe first feasibility analysis of a 4D seismic project shall be assessed during the field \n\ndevelopment phase, due to the high costs involved in the acquisition and processing of 4D \n\nseismic data (seabed or towed streamer acquisition). \n\nA 4D seismic project is approved if: the reservoir under analysis is feasible from the \n\ngeophysical perspective, the new information mitigates the risk of the project and/or the impact \n\non the reservoir management increases the economic return.  \n\nEVOI\n\nDate of \nAcquisition\n\nImpact on \nField \n\nManagement\n\nReservoir \nUncertainties\n\nOther \nSource of \n\nData\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nThe thesis aims to quantify the increase in the economic return due to the acquisition of 4D \n\nseismic data and determine the chance that the quantified value is higher than the costs of \n\nacquisition and processing.  \n\nThe EVOI and the probability density function of the increase on the net present value are \n\ncalculated to incorporate the economic aspect. The methodology to determine the EVOI shall \n\nconsider all aspects mentioned in Figure 1.1, however the literature does not present a method \n\nthat considers the \u201cdate of acquisition\u201d aspect. Thus, the thesis also improved the EVOI \n\nmethodology by estimating the best time to acquire 4D seismic data. \n\n1.1. Motivation \n\nCurrently, the average recovery is quite low due to the complexity of the reservoirs. \n\nAdvances in technologies are continuously occurring at several fronts to assist in increasing the \n\nproduction of hydrocarbons. 4D seismic emerged as an important tool because it captures the \n\ndynamic behavior of the reservoir and aids reservoir management. \n\nBesides of the many successful reported cases, the feasibility of the acquisition of new \n\ninformation must be evaluated. There are two main motivations for conducting a feasibility study. \n\nFirst, to determine whether the 4D signal generated by production effects in the reservoir is \n\ndetectable. Second, to assess the impact on field management and the impact on the risk of the \n\nproject. \n\nThere are several methods that assess the feasibility from the geophysical perspective, such \n\nas the ones presented by Lumley (1998) and Blonk et al. (1998). From the engineering \n\nperspective, the evaluation is performed by comparing the EVOI with the acquisition and \n\nprocessing costs.  \n\nHowever, the existing methods to calculate the EVOI do not consider the \u201cdate of \n\nacquisition\u201d aspect. Another important issue is that the EVOI is a weighted value. It does not \n\nshow the variability of the increase on the economic return caused by the reservoir uncertainties.  \n\nDue to the importance of assessing the feasibility of a new 4D seismic project, the thesis \n\npresents a methodology to estimate the chance of success from the reservoir engineering \n\nperspective. The methodology includes the \u201cdate of acquisition\u201d aspect into the process and \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\ndetermines the probability of the increase on the economic return be higher than the acquisition \n\ncosts. \n\n1.2. Objectives \n\nThe objective of the thesis is to develop a methodology to estimate the chance of success of \n\na 4D seismic project before the information acquisition. The methodology determines the chance \n\nof success for the first acquisition of 4D seismic data and uses a probabilistic approach of the \n\neconomic benefit to assist the decision maker. Moreover, the methodology is applied to a \n\nsynthetic reservoir model in order to test it in a case with known reservoir. \n\n1.3. Premises \n\nThe following assumptions are made in order to apply the proposed methodology to \n\nestimate the chance of success of a 4D seismic project: \n\n\u2022 Pressure and saturation data without noise can be successfully obtained from 4D seismic. \n\nSeveral studies present methods to map and quantify these changes using different seismic \n\nattributes (Tura and Lumley, 1999; Rojas, 2008; Landro, 2001, Trani et al., 2011 and \n\nDavolio, 2013); \n\n\u2022 All reservoir model uncertainties are identified and quantified; \n\n\u2022 The chance of success estimation considers the first acquisition of 4D seismic data.  \n\n1.4. Outline of the Thesis  \n\nThe chance of success methodology is developed in three phases. The first phase evaluates \n\nthe impact of 4D seismic data on the history match process in comparison to the use of only \n\nproduction data. Chapter 2 discusses the improvement on predicting the production behavior \n\nwhen 4D seismic data is used and evaluates the impact of the date of acquisition on the value of \n\n4D seismic project.  \n\nThe second phase develops a methodology to estimate the date of acquisition in which the \n\nvalue of 4D seismic data is maximum. Chapter 3 describes the proposed methodology and its \n\napplication to a synthetic reservoir model. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThe last phase develops the methodology to estimate the chance of success. A variety of \n\ndisciplines are involved: uncertainty and risk analysis, selection of representative models and \n\nproduction strategy optimization. The methodology incorporates the process presented in \n\nChapter 3 and evaluates the number of reservoir model scenarios used to calculate the EVOI.  \n\nChapter 4 describes the methodology to estimate the chance of success and presents the \n\nresults of its application to a synthetic case. The last chapter presents the conclusions and \n\nsuggestions for future work. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n2. IMPACT OF 4D SEISMIC DATA IN THE HISTORY \n\nMATCHING PROCESS \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nWith the advent of 4D seismic surveys in the early 1980`s, the oil industry began using this \n\ntechnology as an indirect tool for monitoring fluid flow (Fahimuddin, 2010). Assuming that 4D \n\nseismic signals can be interpreted in terms of reservoir properties, the large amounts of data are \n\nintegrated with production and other data available to improve the reservoir simulation model. \n\nConstraining the reservoir model to the historical data is referred to as history matching. \n\nThe objective is to obtain a better match between the observed data and reservoir simulation \n\nresults by iteratively perturbing the uncertain model parameters. The reservoir model has to \n\ncorrespond to the historical behavior of the actual reservoir, before one may trust production \n\nforecasts and handle accordingly.  \n\nReservoir management is a complex task that heavily depends on the reservoir simulation \n\nmodel. A reservoir simulation model is used to analyze the behavior of the reservoir and to \n\nforecast future behavior. Constraining the model to all available information raises confidence in \n\nits forecasting capabilities.  \n\nThe combination of 4D seismic data (high lateral resolution) with well data (high vertical \n\nresolution) enormously reduces uncertainty and increases the accuracy of the production forecast \n\n(Stephen et al., 2006). Reservoir management benefits from the reservoir model improvement \n\nbecause decisions can be made to increase the economic return of the project, such as well \n\noptimization, identification of remaining oil and drilling potential areas. \n\nTime lapse seismic is available in a qualitative and quantitative form in a number of North \n\nSea, Gulf of Mexico and Campos Basin fields (Johnston et al., 2000; Thedy et al. 2007; Roste \n\nand Husby, 2006; Smith et al., 2010). The integration of 4D seismic data has been made with \n\ndifferent history matching methodologies.  \n\nStephen (2006) presents an automatic history matching method based on an integrated \n\nworkflow. The method uses a quasi-global stochastic method for choosing new models based on \n\ncalculated misfits between observed and predicted data.  \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nFahimuddin (2010) performed 4D seismic history matching of a sector model based on \n\nNorth Sea reservoir in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework. The work of Roggero et \n\nal. (2012) focused on the advance parametrization technique to constrain fine scale geo-statistical \n\nmodel by means of gradual deformation method in the framework of history matching of the \n\nGirassol field. \n\nA model conditioned to 4D seismic data has an improved accuracy of the production \n\nforecast. Thus, this Chapter evaluates the improvement on the accuracy of the production forecast \n\nby including 4D seismic data into the history matching process. Moreover, discuss the utility of \n\n4D seismic regarding to the date of seismic acquisition. \n\n2.2. Objective \n\nChapter 02 aims to: (1) compare the improvement of the reservoir model obtained using \n\nonly production data and using production data along with 4D seismic data in the history \n\nmatching process (2) evaluate the impact of the date of 4D seismic acquisition on the value of \n\ntime lapse data. \n\n2.3. Assumptions  \n\nIn order to perform the study some simplifications and assumptions are made: \n\n\u2022 The model used is synthetic and simple, representing a specific part of the field, in order to \n\nmake the analysis simpler;  \n\n\u2022 Eight simulation models are used: base model, base model history matched using two, four \n\nand six years of production data; base model history matched using two, four and six years \n\nof production data along with seismic data and the reference model (true earth model); \n\n\u2022 The base model is not history matched. It is known that such model gets closer to the \n\nreference model as long as the history matching process is done using production data; \n\n\u2022 Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic. Water saturation \n\nand pressure maps are generated from the reference model simulation; \n\n\u2022 The time for acquiring and processing the 4D seismic information is not considered in the \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n\u2022 The study is performed after the information acquisition to evaluate the impact of the \n\nresulting data; \n\n\u2022 It is known that the history matching process is a non-unique process. However, the \n\nanalysis is performed in a deterministic manner to make the analysis simpler. \n\n2.4. Methodology \n\nThe study is divided into two cases and the evaluation of both is based on the mismatch in \n\nthe output of the reference reservoir model and the history matched models. The description of \n\neach case is as follows: \n\n(1) Case 1: comparison of the results obtained from the history matched models using only \n\nproduction data and using production data along with seismic data acquired at four years of \n\nproduction; \n\n(2) Case 2: comparison of the results obtained from the history matched models using only \n\nproduction data and using production data along with seismic data at two, four and six \n\nyears of production. \n\n \n\nIn order to evaluate how seismic can improve the initial simulation model, pressure and \n\nsaturation differences are analyzed by generating error maps and calculating the mismatch \n\nbetween the simulated models. \n\n2.4.1. History Matching Methodology \n\nHistory match is one of the most important activities during petroleum reservoirs \n\ndevelopment and management. Matched models are fundamental to ensure reliable forecasts, and \n\ngive an idea of the level of understanding of the geological models. The history match process \n\nconsists in changing uncertain field simulation model attributes, respecting its uncertainty limits, \n\nto match the historical data (Netto et al., 2003). \n\nThe history match process aims to improve the reservoir model quality. When performed \n\nonly with production data, the main objective is to minimize the difference of production data \n\n(well pressure, oil, water and gas rate) between observed and simulated data. When performed \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nwith seismic data, the objective includes the reduction in the differences of reservoir saturation \n\nand pressure maps.  \n\nThe literature presents some methodologies for history matching using seismic data. The \n\nconditioning may be introduced at different levels corresponding to where the mismatch between \n\nsimulated and measured data is evaluated.  \n\nAn illustration of the different mismatch levels is shown in Figure 2.1 the levels are: \n\namplitude, elastic parameters and fluid changes domain. Methodologies that evaluate the \n\nmismatch in the amplitude and elastic domain are presented by Stephen et al. (2006) and \n\nFahimuddin (2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Different levels of 4D seismic integration (Skjervheim, 2007). \n\n \n\nThe present study integrates seismic data in the fluid changes domain, as presented by \n\nMachado (2010). The methodology for history matching is shown in Figure 2.2. Real seismic \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\ndata is not acquired; the saturation and pressure maps are generated from the reference model \n\nsimulation.  \n\nThe process remains the same for history matching using only production data, except that \n\nwater and pressure saturation maps are not included. In both cases, wells are controlled by liquid \n\nrate (computed from the reference model) and the parameters to be matched are the water rate \n\nand well pressure. It is considered that once the liquid rate is informed and the water rate is \n\nmatched, the oil rate is matched as a consequence. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2. History matching process. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe assisted history matching is performed in three steps: data acquisition (historical and \n\nsimulated data), parameterization and optimization. The parameterization phase stands out for its \n\nimportance in the process and requires more dedication of the professional involved. The \n\nparameterization steps are: \n\n? Reservoir Zoning: the reservoir is divided into regions according to the type of information \n\navailable. When seismic data is used, two types of regions are considered: attribute regions \n\nand parameter regions.  \n\n \n\nA parameter region is the reservoir simulation region where the error is measured and its \n\nvalue is incorporated into the objective function. Attribute regions are those where changes \n\nin the reservoir model attributes are made in the process. These regions are determined \n\nfrom the analysis of differences in saturation and pressure maps and streamline \n\ninformation;  \n\n \n\n? Objective Function (FO): the FO is a quantitative evaluation of the history matching. It \n\nmeasures the mismatch between simulated and observed data. The FO used is  \n\nMMPP\nFOwFOwFO ??\n\n,                                                                                                                (2.1) \n\nwhere, wP and wM are the production and maps objective function weights, respectively.

Critical Attributes Definition: because of the model simplicity the sensitivity analyses is not \n\nperformed. The parameters to be adjusted are the absolute permeability and heterogeneities \n\ncharacteristics. \n\n \n\nAfter the parameterization phase, the search for a combination of attributes that minimizes \n\nthe error measured can be done through optimization methods. In the present study, the local \n\nsearch algorithm is used; because the history matching is performed to a reservoir specific region \n\nand with few parameters. The method uses the algorithm developed by Leit\u00e3o e Schiozer (1998) \n\nand Schiozer (1999) which is based on sequences of exploratory and linear search within a \n\ndiscretized solution space. \n\n2.4.2. Error Map \n\nThe error map defines the parameter and the attribute regions. It also analyzes the reservoir \n\nmodel quality. The error map is generated from the water saturation differences between the \n\nreference model data and the history matched models data to each simulation grid cell, in \n\naccordance with  \n\nreference\n\ni\n\nel\n\nii\nSwSwSw ???\n\nmod\n,                                                                                                              (2.4) \n\nwhere the subscript i represents the cell grid model number, ? is the difference between the \n\nreference model and the model analyzed, Sw\nmodel\n\n is the water saturation from the model analyzed \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nand Sw\nreference\n\n is the reference model water saturation. Error values lower than 20% of the highest \n\nvalues are not considered in the definition of the parameter and attribute regions. \n\n2.4.3. Error Function \n\nThe error curve over a production period is given by an error function, defined as the \n\nquantity that represents the mismatch between real data (reference model) and the simulated data \n\n(models studied). The error function used to evaluate the water saturation and pressure maps \n\nmismatch is defined as \n\n? ??\n?\n\n??\nNg\n\ni\n\nreference\n\ni\n\nel\n\ni\nXX\n\n1\n\n2mod\n? ,                                                                                                    (2.5) \n\n \n\nwhere Ng is the number of grid cells, X is the property analyzed (water saturation or pressure); \n\nXi\nmodel\n\n and Xi\nreference\n\n are the model simulated and reference data, and ? is the error. \n\n2.5. Application \n\nThe base reservoir simulation model and reference model were built by Risso (2007) and \n\nmodified by Machado (2010). They consist of a five-spot configuration and are structurally \n\nrepresented by a horizontal top at -1000 m, discretized with a 45x45x1 grid in the x, y and z \n\ndirections, respectively, with a dimension of 40 m in the three orthogonal directions, totaling \n\n2025 blocks.  \n\nThe reservoir permeability (k) and porosity (?) of the models are: \n\n\u2022 Base model: k = 500mD, ??= 20%; \n\n\u2022 Reference model: k = 200 mD, except the channel with high permeability (1000 mD) and \n\nthe impermeable barriers, ? = 20%. \n\n \n\nThe model permeability maps are shown in Figure 2.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 2.3. Reservoir model permeability maps: (a) base model and (b) reference model. \n\n \n\nThe reservoir hydrocarbon fluid is light oil with a viscosity equal to 0.78 cP in the initial \n\nreservoir conditions (static pressure equal to 98 kgf/cm\u00b2 and temperature equal to 50 \u00b0C). The \n\ninitial solubility ratio is equal to 83 m\u00b3/m\u00b3 and there is no water-oil contact. The Black Oil fluid \n\nmodel is used. The production wells are constrained by the liquid rate and the injector well is \n\nconstrained by the water rate. \n\n2.6. Results \n\n2.6.1.

Also the reservoir pressure is higher than the historical data, these are \n\nHM \n\nPeriod\n\nHM \n\nPeriod\n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nexplained by the non-identification of a high permeability channel and barriers by the initial \n\nmodel (Figures 2.14 to 2.17). \n\nWater breakthrough was observed at production well PROD3 during the period considered. \n\nThe information allowed a good water rate match at production well PROD3 for the history \n\nmatched model using only production data. However, water rate forecast was not accurate for \n\nproduction wells PROD 2 and PROD 4. \n\nThe integration of 4D seismic data with production data increased the accuracy in the \n\nproduction forecasts; especially in the prediction of time to breakthrough for the remaining \n\nproduction wells. The oil rate forecast also presented more accurate results. \n\nAn important contribution of 4D seismic data is to better capture the fluid flow behavior \n\nduring production. Such can be seen by evaluating the water saturation error curves presented in \n\nFigure 2.18 and the water saturation maps at different production periods from the history \n\nmatched models presented in Figure 2.19.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.18.

Water saturation map from the reference model and the history matched models. \n\n \n\nThe water saturation error increases up to a peak and then decreases over the production \n\nperiod, since at the beginning of production there is low fluid flow movement and at the end of \n\nproduction the reservoir is almost totally flooded (Figure 2.18).  \n\nThe water saturation error curve obtained from history matched model using only \n\nproduction data presented higher values than the curve obtained from the base model. Even \n\nthough production data enabled the identification of the high permeability channel existence, its \n\nposition and shape are more difficult to determine without spatial data. \n\nThe water saturation error decreases significantly when 4D seismic data is used in the \n\nhistory matching process. Seismic data contributed to better characterize the spatial distribution \n\nof heterogeneities in the field and consequently the fluid flow movement (Figure 2.19).  \n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nINJECTOR\n\nPROD1 PROD2\n\nPROD3 PROD4\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n0 1.000 2.000\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nCombined with reservoir modeling, time-lapse seismic monitoring enables reservoir \n\nengineers to improve reservoir characterization and to reduce uncertainty in production forecasts. \n\nThe quantification of uncertainty reduction can be performed using the emulator technique.  \n\nThe emulator was applied to the same synthetic reservoir model in order to quantify the \n\nuncertainty reduction due to production data over different production periods.

PROD 4 BHP: 4D seismic history matched models. \n\n \n\nEvaluating the prediction period, 4D seismic data improves water breakthrough prediction \n\nfor the production wells PROD2 and PROD3 considering two years of historical data \n\n(Figures 2.25 and 2.26). The improvement in the production forecast is achieved for the history \n\nmatched models using production data when breakthrough occurs; this occurs for production well \n\n2 yr\n\n4 yr\n\n6 yr\n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nPROD3 with four years of historical data (Figure 2.22). At this moment, seismic value decreases \n\nbecause production data itself shows that the base model is inadequate. \n\nAfter four years of production, history matching can be started with the calibration of \n\nproduction well PROD3. However, as production data provides information at a specific \n\nreservoir location several alternatives could explain this early breakthrough, such as: high \n\npermeability channel, higher permeability of the reservoir near the production well and fractures. \n\nThe quantity of data used in history matching increases with six years of production. The \n\nproduction behavior is more accurate for the history matched models using only production data, \n\neven though the barriers were not identified in the process. The increase in the amount of \n\navailable information impacts on the value of 4D seismic data. Other source of data can be used \n\nto identify and characterize the uncertain reservoir heterogeneities. \n\nThe prediction of the bottom-hole pressure is accurate for most of history matched models. \n\nThe results obtained for the models history matched with two years of production were lower \n\nthan the historical data. As the reservoir isn\u2019t compartmentalized, pressure is not a critical issue. \n\n \n\nDynamic Data Analysis \n\nAnother value derived from the integration of 4DS with production data is the improvement \n\non the simulation model quality, generating more accurate pressure and saturation information. \n\nThe improvement on the dynamic data from the history matched models were evaluated by \n\ncomputing the water saturation and pressure error curves over the production period \n\nThe water saturation error curves are presented in Figures 2.36 and 2.37 while the pressure \n\nerror curves are shown in Figures 2.38 and 2.39. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.36.

This occurs because well data do not capture the fluid flow behavior during production, \n\nmaking it difficult to identify the correct position and shape of the high permeability channel. \n\nWhen 4D seismic data is used, water saturation error decreases significantly for the history \n\nmatched model with two years of historical data.

The understanding of \n\nthe reservoir fluid flow movement assists the decision maker to improve the production strategy \n\nand increase the NPV as a consequence. \n\nThe evaluation of the date for 4D seismic data acquisition must consider the economic \n\nimpact of the new information in the reservoir management. The revenue percentage to be \n\nobtained from oil was calculated for the reference model to illustrate how 4D seismic value is \n\nrelated to the production strategy flexibility. The results obtained are presented Figure 2.41.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.41.

Thus, the improvement of the production strategy at this moment can increase \n\nthe NPV since there is a significant amount of remaining oil in the reservoir. \n\nHowever, at eight years of production changes in production strategy are limited, having \n\nonly 20% of the revenue to be obtained. Thus, the utility of seismic data acquired at this period \n\ndecreases significantly.  \n\nThe production period in which the acquisition of 4D seismic data has the highest impact \n\nwas determined based on the production, dynamic and the simple economic analysis. The \n\nacquisition period is between 2 and 4 years of production to the case studied. In summary: \n\n? The history matched model using 4D seismic data acquired at two years of production \n\npresented an improvement on the prediction capability; \n\n? After four years of production an improvement on the prediction capability is also \n\npresented by the history matched model using only production data, because water \n\nbreakthrough had occurred; \n\n? The history matched models using only production data for all historical periods analyzed \n\ndecreased water saturation maps quality; \n\n? The history matched models using production data and 4D seismic data for all historical \n\nperiods analyzed increased water saturation maps quality; \n\n? If the production strategy was flexible, it would be possible to implement operational \n\nchanges related to water breakthrough prediction. Between two and four years of \n\nproduction there is a range of approximately 75% to 50% of remaining revenue. \n\n2.7. Conclusions \n\nThe use of production data for history matching did not identify the barriers and some \n\nchannel characteristics such as, angle and width. The history matching performed with four years \n\nof production data improved the production forecast. However, the prediction of the movement of \n\nfluid flow decreased significantly, because the water saturation errors increased at least 105%.  \n\nThe acquisition of 4D seismic data at 4 years of production improved the production \n\nforecast and reduced the water saturation errors at least 76%. However, at this production period \n\nthe water breakthrough had occurred. The water breakthrough occurrence reduces the impact on \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nthe reservoir management. Thus, it is an important factor that affects the value of 4D seismic \n\ndata. \n\nThe acquisition of 4D seismic data at an early production stage improves the reservoir \n\nmodel. The history matching using 4D seismic data acquired at two years of production provided \n\nbetter production forecast than using only production data, especially for the water rate at \n\nproduction wells PROD 2, 3 and 4.  \n\nThe water saturation errors decreased at least 38%. The reduction on the water saturation \n\nerrors shows that the reservoir model better predicts the fluid flow behavior. However, it was not \n\npossible to identify the exact moment of water breakthrough at production well PROD 3.  \n\nThe period of highest impact for 4D seismic acquisition is between 2 and 4 years of \n\nproduction. It would be possible to predict the water breakthrough at production wells and \n\nconsequently make decisions that would delay the breakthrough. Also, the revenue to be obtained \n\nfrom oil decreases significantly at later times. There would be only 20% of remaining revenue to \n\nbe obtained after eight years of production. \n\nThe water saturation error curve quantifies the quality of the dynamic data from a reservoir \n\nsimulation model. It also provides important information about the possibility of remaining oil \n\nareas. \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n3. ESTIMATION OF THE BEST PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR \n\n4D SEISMIC DATA ACQUISITION  \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nChapter 2 showed that the date for 4D seismic acquisition affects the value of 4D seismic \n\ndata. If seismic data identifies changes in reservoir properties in the initial production phase, the \n\nproject return increases through improvements in production strategy. On the other hand, if these \n\nchanges are identified too late, the flexibility in decision making is reduced; consequently, few \n\nchanges can be made in the production strategy.  \n\nAlso, the availability of other source of data reduces reservoir uncertainties and improves \n\nfield development. Thus, the utility of 4D seismic is related to the period for 4D seismic data \n\nacquisition and, if done at the appropriate time, this tool has positive impacts on field \n\nmanagement. \n\nThe analysis of the improvement on the production data and dynamic data forecast, \n\npresented in Chapter 02, assumed that the true earth model was known. However, this is not what \n\nhappens in practice.  \n\nThe estimation of the value of 4D seismic data shall be determined before its acquisition. \n\nTherefore, the best period for 4D seismic acquisition shall be identified without knowing the \n\nreference model. \n\nThe estimation of the period for 4D seismic acquisition is a challenge task, because it is a \n\nproblem of decision making under uncertainty. The acquisition of 4D seismic data in different \n\nproduction periods impacts the reservoir management in different manners.  \n\nThus, the present Chapter describes a methodology to estimate the best production period \n\nfor 4D seismic acquisition. The evaluation process is simple and the methodology is divided in \n\nthree steps: uncertainty analysis; production data analysis and water saturation error analysis.  \n\nThe proposed methodology is applied to a simple and synthetic reservoir model is order to \n\nexemplify the process. The results obtained are also shown in the present Chapter. The \n\nmethodology will be incorporated in the chance of success methodology that is presented in \n\nChapter 4.  \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n3.2. Objective \n\nThe objective is to describe the methodology that estimates the best production period for \n\n4D seismic data acquisition considering the reservoir uncertainties and to present its application \n\nto a simple synthetic reservoir model. \n\n3.3. Assumptions  \n\nThe following assumptions are adopted: \n\n? The model used is synthetic and simple. It represents a specific part of the field in order to \n\nmake the analysis simpler;  \n\n? The reservoir model uncertainties are properly quantified; \n\n? Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic without noise. \n\n3.4. Proposed Methodology \n\nThe proposed methodology comprises four stages; as described in the following sections. \n\n3.4.1. Uncertainty Analysis \n\nThe base deterministic reservoir model is a simulation model constructed with the most \n\nprobable values of all input values. The base model is analyzed in order to define the reservoir \n\nuncertainties. Depending on the amount of uncertainties, a sensitivity analysis can be performed \n\nto identify the most critical attributes to be considered in the process.  \n\nThe critical attributes must be combined through a statistical technique, among the existing \n\nones: derivation tree, Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube. Depending on the number of uncertain \n\nattributes the use of derivation tree leads to a high number of scenarios. Monte Carlo is a tradition \n\ntechnique to sample randomly within the range of the input distribution. However, a high number \n\nof iterations are needed to sample enough quantities to accurately represent the input distribution. \n\nLatin Hypercube sampling is designed to accurately recreate the input distribution through \n\nsampling in less iteration when compared to Monte Carlo method. The key is stratification of the \n\ninput probability distributions.  \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nStratification divides the cumulative probability curve into equal intervals. A sample is \n\nrandomly taken from each interval of the input distribution. The technique being used during \n\nLatin Hypercube sampling is \u201csampling without replacement\u201d. The number of stratifications of \n\nthe cumulative distribution is equal to the number of iterations performed (University of Oslo, \n\n2005). \n\nAs more efficient sampling method, Latin Hypercube is used in the methodology to \n\nestimate the best time for 4D seismic acquisition. The scenarios generated are then simulated \n\nusing commercial simulation software to obtain the production outputs.  \n\n3.4.2. Production Data Analysis \n\nChapter 2 showed that production data itself can reduce the reservoir uncertainties and \n\nimprove the production forecast. Time for breakthrough has indicated to be an important \n\nparameter. It increases the production data capability to identify the reservoir heterogeneities and \n\nto improve the knowledge of the geological framework.  \n\nThe acquisition of 4D seismic data before water breakthrough occurs improves the \n\nproduction well operational parameters. Decisions can be made in order to delay the \n\nbreakthrough and increase the oil production rate as a consequence.  \n\n4D seismic data gives information about the evolution in space and time of the fluid \n\ndistributions inside the reservoir. Thus, the value of 4D seismic data increases when its \n\nacquisition is made at a moment in which production data does not provide a good \n\ncharacterization of the reservoir. \n\nTherefore, water rate of each production well for all scenarios must be evaluated. The \n\nprobability of water breakthrough occurrence at different production periods shall be determined. \n\nThe acquisition period is determined based on these probabilities, depending on the decision \n\nmaker risk aversion. \n\n3.4.3. Dynamic Data Analysis \n\nThe best time for 4D seismic acquisition is the one that only 4D seismic data is able to \n\nidentify that the base model does not represent the true earth model and there is enough time to \n\nmake decision changes in field operations.  \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nThe calculation of the water saturation error between each scenario and the base model is \n\nnecessary to estimate the best period for 4D seismic acquisition. The water saturation error curve \n\nover a production period is given by an error function.  \n\nThe error function is defined as the quantity that represents the mismatch between the \n\nreservoir simulation scenario and the base model water saturation maps; each scenario is \n\nconsidered as a true earth model. The error function used is defined as  \n\n? ??\n?\n\n??\nNg\n\ni\n\nscenario\n\ni\n\nbase\n\ni\nXX\n\n1\n\n2\n?                                                                                                                                   (3.1) \n\nand the normalized error function is  \n\n)(?\n\n?\n?\n\nhighest\nnorm\n\n? ,                                                                                                                                             (3.2) \n\nwhere Ng is the number of grid cells, X is the property analyzed (water saturation); Xi\nbase\n\n and \n\nXi\nscenario\n\n are the base and scenario model data, and ? is the error. \n\nThe water saturation error graph shows, for each possible scenario, if there is significant \n\ninformation about the reservoir fluid flow to identify that the model considered (base model) is \n\ndifferent from the true earth model.  \n\nThe information is considered perfect, thus the acquisition of information identifies the true \n\nearth model represented by each scenario. It is known that in practice history matching would be \n\nperformed and the resulting reservoir model would be closer to the true earth model.  \n\nThe normalized water saturation error graph is used to identify the moment in which the \n\nwater saturation is highest and assists the estimation of the acquisition period. This period shall \n\nbe between the moment in which there is enough water saturation error and enough time to \n\nimplement actions that improve the reservoir management. \n\n3.4.4. Acquisition Period Estimation \n\nThe results obtained in production and dynamic analyses are evaluated. An upper limit for \n\n4D seismic acquisition is the one that the probability of water breakthrough occurs at any \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nproduction wells is high. The definition of the probability value depends on the decision maker \n\nrisk aversion. The lower limit is the one that there is enough water saturation error between the \n\nbase model and the true earth model to identify that the base model is incorrect. \n\n3.5. Application \n\nThe methodology to estimate the best time for 4D seismic acquisition is applied to a \n\nsynthetic model.

Production Data Analysis \n\nThe date for 4D seismic acquisition is limited to the time for water breakthrough for non-\n\nmature reservoirs. The date for water breakthrough at each production well for each scenario was \n\ndetermined. The water rate for each production well is presented in Figures 3.8 to 3.11. \n\nIt can be seen that time for BT is highly variable. The probability of water breakthrough at \n\ndifferent production periods was determined. Water breakthrough is one of the parameters \n\nanalyzed to estimate the acquisition period and the estimation is based on BT probabilities, \n\ndepending on the decision maker risk aversion.  \n\nThe probabilities were computed by quantifying the number of scenarios in which the BT \n\noccurred in any production well at a specific production period. The values obtained are:  \n\n? Before four years of production: 1 scenario, 0.5% of probability; \n\n? Before six years of production: 11 scenarios, 5.5% of probability. \n\n? Before eight years of production: 94 scenarios, 47% of probability. \n\n \n\nThe reduction of the uncertainty of the breakthrough prediction is one of 4DS utility in non-\n\nmature fields. Decisions can be made in order to delay the breakthrough and increase the oil \n\nproduction rate as a consequence.  \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nIn the case studied, the production strategy is not flexible and only well operational changes \n\ncan be made to increase field profitability. Assuming that 47% of BT probability is a high level \n\nof risk, eight years of production would be the limiting to acquire seismic data.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8.

Dynamic Data Analysis \n\nThe water saturation error curve was obtained by comparing the water saturation map from \n\nthe base model and the water saturation map from each scenario; these curves are presented in \n\nFigure 3.12.  \n\nThe graph shows, for each possible scenario, if there is significant water saturation error to \n\nidentify that the base model is different from the true earth model. It can be seen that there are \n\nscenarios with fluid distributions highly different from the base model and scenarios that are \n\ngeologically similar resulting in low error values. \n\nThe water saturation curves were normalized to identify the appropriate acquisition period. \n\nThe normalized curve identifies the moment in which the water saturation error is highest and are \n\npresented in Figure 3.13. \n\nIt was considered that 70% of the highest error value would be enough for the true earth \n\nmodel identification. Figure 3.14 shows a histogram of production time in which normalized \n\nwater saturation error is equal 70%. It can be seen that the highest number of scenarios occurs at \n\nfive years of production. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12. Water saturation error curves. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13.

Acquisition Period Estimation \n\nThe period for the first 4D seismic data acquisition is between five and eight years of \n\nproduction, based on the production and the dynamic data analysis. The period was determined \n\nconsidering a non-mature reservoir without production strategy flexibility.  \n\nThe inferior limit, five years, is the minimum time at which variations in the reservoir \n\ndynamic properties occurred. The superior limit, eight years, indicates the time at which there is a \n\nhigh probability of breakthrough. The production period obtained is different from the one \n\npresented in Chapter 2. Such can be justified by the neglected barriers in the scenarios. \n\n3.7. Conclusions \n\nThe proposed methodology to estimate the best time for 4D seismic data acquisition \n\nincorporates common routines used in the industry, such as uncertainty analysis, and it adds a \n\nnew procedure through the dynamic data analysis. \n\nTwo are the main factors that define the acquisition period: the water breakthrough and the \n\nwater saturation error. The acquisition of 4D seismic data shall be before water breakthrough. \n\nThe identification of the water flow path improves the well operational parameters and \n\nconsequently increases the project economic return.  \n\nThe appropriate acquisition period is also limited to the time at which 4D seismic data \n\nidentifies that the base model does not represent the true earth model. The time is defined by \n\nconsidering that 70% of the maximum normalized water saturation error is sufficient to identify \n\nthe true earth model. \n\nThe acquisition period obtained for the synthetic reservoir model is between five and eight \n\nyears of production. Such period is different from the one presented in Chapter 2 because the \n\nbarriers were neglected. At five years, the normalized water saturation error is equal 70% for \n\nmost of the scenarios and at eight years there is 47% of probability of water breakthrough. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n4. METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE THE CHANCE OF \n\nSUCCESS OF A 4D SEISMIC PROJECT  \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nA 4D seismic project is considered successful from the reservoir engineering perspective \n\nwhen 4D seismic data mitigates the risk and/or increases the economic value of the project. \n\nMeasuring and, especially, predicting the economic impact of new information is complex; \n\nwithin such setting the value of information (VOI) concept rises as an important decision-making \n\ntool.  \n\nIt is simpler to quantify 4D seismic data value after the data acquisition. A deterministic \n\nvalue is calculated by quantifying the impact that the new information had in the field \n\nmanagement. Even though the quantification is simpler, it is difficult to define the decisions that \n\nwould have been taken if no information had been acquired.  \n\nIn contrast, the quantification of the EVOI before the data acquisition is more complex and \n\nmust consider the reservoir model uncertainties and the uncertainty in future information (Dunn, \n\n1992; Gerhardt and Haldorsen, 1989).  \n\nCurrently the concept of EVOI is widespread over the oil and gas literature. The EVOI \n\nmust take into account the potential benefits. Waggoner (2002) listed and discussed some of the \n\nmost beneficial and common impacts of 4D seismic acquisition in reservoir management: \n\n? Avoid poor well placement: 4D results can prevent poor well placement by assessing the \n\nstate of the reservoir at a planned well location. The value of the 4D information saves the \n\ncost of an unnecessary well; \n\n? Optimize placement of new wells: when 4D results are used to plan a new well location, it \n\nis possible to optimize the placement of that well; \n\n? Locate undrained reservoir compartments: when 4D data indicates no reservoir change in \n\nareas expected to be in production, it is likely that those areas of the reservoir are isolated \n\ncompartments. By locating the compartment, 4D data quantifies the lost reserves and allow \n\nplacement of a well to access it. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n? Identify drained areas/fluid fronts: it is possible to anticipate early breakthrough, potentially \n\nin time to adjust field production rates to prevent breakthrough from occurring. 4D seismic \n\ninformation is also important for locating new wells away from fluid fronts to extend the \n\nplateau and accelerate production; \n\n? Reduce uncertainty in reservoir models: reservoir models always contain a degree of \n\nuncertainty, but 4D results can reduce that. With less uncertainty, there is less risk in many \n\nreservoir development and production decisions, which could result in accepting rather than \n\nrejecting an economically viable project. \n\n \n\nDecision trees, developed as a concept in the 1960\u2019s, have gradually become the most \n\nwidely accepted tool in the petroleum industry to assess the value of information (Ballin et al., \n\n2005). Decision tree models have been used to quantify the economic impact of seismic imaging \n\non reservoir management (Waggoner, 2002) and the key to their successful use is to frame the \n\nproblem, understand key sensitivities and keep it simple. \n\nA widely used method to determine the VOI calculates the difference between expected \n\nmonetary value with and without information for possible scenarios through a decision tree. The \n\nmain differences observed in the literature lies on how the impact of information acquisition is \n\nconsidered in the decision tree, the integration of uncertainty in the process and the estimation of \n\nreliability of information. \n\nWaggoner (2002) considered the impact of 4D seismic data acquisition in two different \n\nways: 4D information can (1) increase the net present value and (2) increase the chance of \n\nsuccess. The increase on the net present value is included in the decision tree by using a larger \n\nvalue of oil production in the branch considering the information gathering.  \n\nBallin et al. (2005) evaluated the impact of 4D seismic data in the compartmentalization \n\nrisk, the decision is related to drill/recomplete a well or not. The main value comes from \n\nchanging the probability of the well\u2019s economic failure. The uncertainty is included in the process \n\nby combining regional database with reserve uncertainty to estimate the risk of well failure.  \n\nCoopersmith and Cunningham (2002) and Bratvold et al. (2009) include the concept of \n\nimperfect information by incorporating the Bayes\u2019 theorem in the analysis. Pinto et al (2011) also \n\npresented a method to quantify the monetary value of imperfect information provided by time-\n\nlapse seismic data acquisition. The proposed method is a simple application of real option \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nanalysis in which the value of perfect information is obtained and then the value of imperfect \n\ninformation is determined using a transfer factor.  \n\nThe method presented by Pinto et al. (2011) generates a group of possible scenarios along \n\nwith all possible production strategies for the reservoir. The scenarios generation considered only \n\nthree variables: production, cost and oil price. The expected value without information is \n\ndetermined by weighting the net present value obtained from the scenarios using the base \n\nproduction strategy.  \n\n4D seismic data identifies the state of nature, therefore a specific production strategy is \n\nconsidered. The expected value with information is determined by weighting the net present \n\nvalue obtained from the scenarios using the specific production strategy. The value of perfect \n\ninformation is the difference between the expected values with and without information. \n\nA transfer factor is used to compute the value of imperfect information. It represents a \n\nlearning measure and indicates how effective the information is in reducing the uncertainty in the \n\ndecision making process. The transfer factor is determined through a regression model derived \n\nfrom the technical scoring criteria introduced by Lumley et al. (1997). \n\nThe EVOI assessment of 4D seismic data is complex and requires several simplifications to \n\nmake the process viable. However, it should consider the four aspects mentioned in Chapter 1: \n\n \n\n? Date of acquisition: Chapter 2 discussed the impact that the date of 4D seismic acquisition \n\nhas on the value of 4D seismic data. In summary, the acquisition cannot be too early \n\nbecause seismic data may not identify variations in the reservoir dynamic properties, or too \n\nlate because major changes may no longer be detected and the flexibility in decision \n\nmaking is reduced; i.e., few changes can be made in the production strategy; \n\n? Impact on field management: for a 4D seismic project to be considered an economic \n\nsuccess, the provided information should impact field operations and should generate more \n\nmonetary benefit than its acquisition cost; \n\n? Reservoir uncertainties: the reservoir model used to assist the decision making process is \n\ndeveloped under several physical uncertainties. Thus, the VOI should be assessed under \n\nuncertainty. The term Expected Value of Information (EVOI) should be used in this \n\ncontext; \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n? Other source of data: there are several potential sources of information that can improve the \n\ndecision making process and can reduce the reservoir uncertainty. \n\n \n\nA methodology to determine the EVOI that considers all aspects mentioned above is \n\nneeded. The present chapter describes a methodology that estimates the EVOI considering the \n\n\u201cdate of acquisition\u201d aspect. The methodology also incorporates a probabilistic approach in the \n\nestimation of the chance of success.  \n\nThe chance of success methodology is applicable to projects in the development phase. The \n\nevaluation is performed considering the best production period to acquire 4D seismic data. If the \n\nresult obtained does not indicate that 4D seismic data would improve the economic return of the \n\nproject, the use of continuous acquisition also would not be viable. \n\n4.2. Objective \n\nThe objective of the present Chapter is to describe the methodology that estimates the \n\nchance of success of a 4D seismic project before having 4D seismic data. The methodology uses \n\nthe concept of EVOI and incorporates the methodology described in Chapter 2. Moreover, \n\npresent its application to a synthetic reservoir model in order to test the methodology in a case \n\nwith known answer. \n\n4.3. Assumptions \n\nThe following assumptions are made: \n\n? Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic data; \n\n? 4D seismic data is considered as perfect information; \n\n? All reservoir model uncertainties are identified and quantified. \n\n4.4. Theoretical Concepts \n\nThe process comprises several methodologies used in reservoir engineering which are \n\ndescribed in the next sections. \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n4.4.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis \n\nUncertainty is related to the lack of knowledge about reservoir properties, economics or \n\ntechnology. The uncertain attributes affect the decision-making during reservoir management. \n\nThe uncertainty and risk analysis involve: identifying the reservoir uncertain attributes, \n\ngenerating scenarios through statistical combination, running the numerical simulation and \n\ndetermining the risk curve. \n\nA team of geologists, geophysicists and engineers is responsible for the definition of the \n\nuncertain attributes. The uncertainty concerning the attributes value can be expressed in terms of \n\nprobabilistic distributions; and each attribute can be discretized into uncertainty levels according \n\nto its probability density function (pdf). Usually three uncertainty levels are considered for each \n\nattribute: probable, optimistic and pessimistic (Steagall, 2001). \n\nDepending on the quantity of uncertain attributes; it is necessary to perform a sensibility \n\nanalysis, because not all uncertain attributes generate risk to a project (Becerra, 2011). Thus, the \n\nquantity of uncertain attributes can be reduced as soon as an uncertainty generates low or none \n\nvariation in the reservoir simulation outputs.  \n\nThe model is evaluated at lower and upper bounds of each uncertainty in turns. The results \n\nare traditionally displayed in a tornado plot, also known as Pareto. This type of plot helps the \n\nidentification of the variables that have the most impact. \n\nThe critical attributes must be combined to generate scenarios that represent the reservoir \n\nuncertainty. Statistical techniques such as, derivation tree, Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube are \n\nused. Among these techniques, the results obtained using the Latin Hypercube are more accurate \n\n(Risso et al., 2011). \n\nThe Latin Hypercube Technique is characterized by the division of the uncertainties range \n\ninto sub-regions, and the sample is realized in each region. The trials number in each region is \n\ndefined proportionally to the probability of the specific region and each model probability of \n\noccurrence is defined by 1/N, where N is the total number of trials. \n\nThe risk curve that quantifies the project risk is obtained from the simulation results of the \n\ngenerated scenarios. The curve relates the objective function of each model to a cumulative \n\nprobability of occurrence. An example of objective function is the net present value (NPV). \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n4.4.2. Representative Models \n\nIt is inefficient to estimate the 4D seismic chance of success considering all scenarios in the \n\nprocess. The number of scenarios generated in the uncertainty and risk analysis is high. Thus, \n\nrepresentative models (RM) (that represent the reservoir uncertainties behavior) become \n\nnecessary to guarantee a reliable analysis,  \n\nAccording to Ligero et al. (2005), the selection of representative models consists of \n\nchoosing, among the simulated reservoir scenarios, the ones that better represent the variability of \n\nthe attributes and the variability of the objective function. For this, cross plots of the objective \n\nfunction (NPV in the current study) and simulated production results (BHP and oil rate, for \n\nexample) are obtained.  \n\nReservoir models are chosen close to the scenarios considered as P10, P50 and P90. The \n\npercentile P90 means that there is a 90% probability of obtaining higher values than those \n\nassociated with the index P90. The number of representative models depends on: (1) reliability \n\nneeded, (2) objective of the analysis needed, and (3) variability of the objective function and the \n\nuncertain attributes. \n\n4.4.3. Water Saturation Error Analysis \n\nThe concept of water saturation error and its use to evaluate the quality of a reservoir model \n\nconsidered as base model is presented in the section 3.4.3 in Chapter 3. The saturation error curve \n\nover a production period is used to identify if scenarios present a reservoir fluid flow movement \n\ndifferent from that expected. If the water saturation error is low, the impact of 4D seismic \n\ninformation on the identification of the true earth model decreases.  \n\n4.4.4. Economic Analysis.  \n\nA parameter used in the economic evaluation of oil and gas projects is the Net Present \n\nValue (NPV). NPV is the discounted value of investment cash inflows minus the discounted \n\nvalue of its cash outflows. An investment should have a net present value greater than zero to be \n\nadequately profitable. The NPV is expressed as \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n     ?\n   \n\n(   )  \n \n   ,                                                                                                                                            (4.1) \n\nwhere, CF is the cash flow, i is the production period interval, t is the time related to the interval \n\nconsidered, r is the discount rate and N is the number of intervals considered. \n\nAnother important economic concept is the Expected Monetary Value (EMV). It is defined \n\nas the total of the outcomes multiplied by the corresponding probability of occurrence associated \n\nwith a decision. The EMV is determined by \n\n    ?        \n \n   ,                                                                                                                                         (4.2) \n\nwhere, N is the number of possible scenarios, j represent a specific scenario and P is the \n\nprobability of occurrence. \n\n4.4.5. Value of Information \n\nThe estimation of the expected value of information (EVOI) is an important tool used in the \n\ndecision making process. The risk level can be high in the field development phase, depending on \n\nthe reservoir uncertainties. The acquisition of new information can increase the project\u2019s \n\neconomic return due to the reduction of uncertainty and to the impact on reservoir management.  \n\nBratvold et al. (2009) commented that the fundamental question for any information \n\ngathering process is whether the likely improvement in decision-making is worth the cost of the \n\ninformation. The EVOI technique is designed to answer this question. \n\nThe methodology used to estimate the EVOI is based on Ligero et al. (2005), which \n\nintegrates the decision tree analysis, risk analysis, uncertainty probabilistic approach and the \n\nproduction strategy optimization into the process. As the EVOI methodology is assessed under \n\nuncertainty and uses a probabilistic approach, the term Expected Value of Information (EVOI) is \n\nused. If the decision maker is risk neutral, EVOI is obtained by  \n\nEVOI=EMVwith information - EMVwithout information .                                                                                 (4.3) \n\nThe change of the EMV is linked to the impact on the field management due to the \n\nacquisition of new information. Moreover, if the decision maker makes the same decision no \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nmatter how the test results, then EVOI is equal to zero and the acquisition of new information is \n\nworthless. \n\nThe EMVwithout information is determined by applying a fixed production strategy, which \n\nmaximizes the EMV, to all representative models. It is assumed that the base model production \n\nstrategy maximizes the expected monetary value (EMV). It is represented by \n\n                       ? (                           )\n   \n   ,                                                              (4.4) \n\nwhere, P is the probability of the representative model, NRM is the number of representative \n\nmodels. \n\nThe EMVwith information is determined by applying a specific production strategy developed \n\nfor each representative model. It is represented by \n\n                    ? (               )\n   \n     ,                                                                                   (4.5) \n\nwhere, s is the specific production strategy for each representative model. \n\nEven when the economic parameter EVOI does not indicate that the acquisition of new \n\ninformation can improve the project economic return, the impact on the project risk should be \n\nevaluated. \n\nAccording to Marques et al. (2013), the concept of risk varies depending on the decision \n\nmakers\u2019 profile and objective of the study. The standard deviation normalized by the EMV is \n\nused to quantify the risk; however this concept was not applied in the thesis. \n\n4.5. Proposed Methodology \n\nThe proposed methodology follows the process described in Figure 4.1. The process \n\ncomprises six stages in which two of them (highlighted in red) are the main contributions of the \n\nthesis.  \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Methodology to estimate the 4D seismic chance of success. \n\n4.5.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis \n\nThis first stage defines the reservoir model uncertainty parameters. Using a statistical \n\nprocedure to combine these uncertainties, all possible scenarios are generated and the base model \n\nis chosen (usually the scenario with a probability of occurrence of 50%). \n\nThe production strategy is optimized considering only the base model to determine the base \n\nproduction strategy. With an economic analysis the NPV of each scenario is determined \n\nconsidering the base production strategy.  \n\nThe range of NPV obtained indicates the projects risk level. The decision maker risk profile \n\ndefines if the NPV range represents high risk or not. If the project is considered high risk, the \n\nacquisition of 4D seismic data would reduce the risk and improve reservoir management, so the \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nestimation process proceeds. For low risk, the decision maker can decide to not acquire 4D \n\nseismic data. \n\n4.5.2. Representative Models Definition \n\nThe many possible scenarios make the selection of representative models necessary. The \n\nchance of success estimation includes the evaluation of the impact on the reservoir management \n\nthrough the strategy optimization. Thus, it would be time consuming to analyze all possible \n\nscenarios.  \n\nThe selection of the representative models is done by plotting the main objective function \n\n(e.g. NPV) against the secondary objective function (e.g. RF, Np) and choosing scenarios that \n\nrepresent both values variation. The minimum number of representative models must be the one \n\nin which there is no significant variation on the EVOI result (Schiozer et al., 2004; Costa &amp; \n\nSchiozer, 2008). \n\n4.5.3. Acquisition Period Estimation (Engineering Perspective) \n\nThe utility of 4D seismic data varies depending on the date of 4D seismic data acquisition. \n\nThe importance of estimating the best time to acquire 4D seismic data was described in Chapter 2 \n\nand the methodology to determine the acquisition period was presented in Chapter 3.  \n\nThe chance of success methodology provides a first estimative of the economic benefits \n\ndue to 4D seismic data, thus the evaluation is performed considering the best period for 4D \n\nseismic data acquisition. The period is such that there is significant variation in the dynamic \n\nproperties and there is enough time to impact on the reservoir management. \n\nThe information that comes from 4D seismic data is evaluated in terms of water saturation \n\nmap. A production period is considered the best for 4D seismic data acquisition when it is \n\npossible to identify that the base reservoir model does not represent the true earth model and \n\nenables to anticipate the breakthrough at production wells.  \n\nThe best production period estimation is done at the development phase and it is assumed \n\nthat the period is suitable from the geophysical perspective. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n4.5.4. Strategy Optimization \n\nThe production strategy of each representative model is optimized from the moment of data \n\nacquisition and processing to quantify the economic impact of the acquired 4D seismic data. The \n\ninformation is considered perfect, thus 4D seismic data identifies the true earth model represented \n\nby the representative models.  \n\nThe objective of the optimization process is to improve the production strategy and increase \n\nthe objective function until a predefined criterion is obtained. Net Present Value (NPV) is the \n\nobjective function considered in this study. \n\n4.5.5. Chance of Success (COS) Analysis \n\nThe net present values of each representative model obtained applying the base production \n\nstrategy and the specific production strategy are compared. The increment on the NPV is the \n\neconomic benefit due the information acquisition.  \n\nIn general the impact on the reservoir management is measured by quantifying the expected \n\nvalue of information (EVOI). However, the EVOI is a mean value and does not show the \n\nvariability of the economic impact on the project.  \n\nThus, the chance of success methodology introduces a new way to analyze the increase on \n\nthe economic value of the project due to new data. The production strategy optimization of each \n\nrepresentative model provides the increase of the NPV and its probability of occurrence, a \n\nprobability density curve is then calculated. It shows the variability of the economic impact and \n\nthe probability that the increase on the NPV is higher than the cost of data acquisition and \n\nprocessing.  \n\n4.5.6. Decision Maker Evaluation \n\nBased on the data provided in the chance of success analysis stage, the decision maker may \n\ntake the following actions: \n\n? End the process: the decision maker decides to acquire or to not acquire 4D seismic data; \n\n? Continue the analysis: the decision maker decides to continue the process. Three are the \n\npossibilities: (1) to improve the evaluation accuracy by selecting more representative \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nmodels, (2) to evaluate a different acquisition period or (3) to improve the strategy \n\noptimization procedure. \n\n4.6. Application \n\nThe chance of success methodology was applied to a synthetic model. The reservoir model \n\ndescription and uncertainties are presented in the next sections. \n\n4.6.1. Reservoir Model Description \n\nThe reservoir model was generated with information from three exploratory wells \n\naccording to a prior geological and structural interpretation. The reservoir model presents two \n\nfacies: Facie 1 corresponds to a sandstone type rock and Facie 2 corresponds to a shaly sandstone \n\ntype. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 show the reservoir model properties and PVT table, respectively. \n\nFigure 4.2 shows the relative permeability curves for the oil and water phases for both facies and \n\nFigure 4.3 presents the porosity, permeability, NTG and facies for the third layer. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

Reservoir Model Uncertainties \n\nThe reservoir model uncertainties definition and quantification is done in the developing \n\nphase, so there are many associated uncertainties. The uncertain attributes of the reservoir model \n\nunder analysis were divided into two groups: discrete attributes and map attributes. \n\nThe discrete uncertain attributes were divided into six levels and are presented in Table 4.4; \n\nwhile the maps attributes are: (1) permeability map; (2) porosity map; (3) NTG map and (4) \n\nfacies distribution. Five hundred maps of each map type (1, 2, 3 and 4) were generated using the \n\nPetrel Software.  \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nTable 4.4.

Results \n\nThe results obtained for each methodology stage applied to the synthetic reservoir model \n\nare presented in the next sections. \n\n4.7.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis \n\nDue to the many uncertainty attribute levels, the Latin Hypercube was used to generate 500 \n\nscenarios. All attributes have a uniform distribution. The field production results from all \n\nscenarios and from the base model are presented in Figures 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7. The base model is \n\none combination of all uncertainties. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Scenarios and base model field cumulative oil. \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6. Scenarios and base model field cumulative water. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7. Scenarios and base model reservoir pressure. \n\n \n\nThe NPV was calculated using the UNIPAR-MEC software and the base model production \n\nstrategy was applied to each scenario. The price context and the costs are presented in Table 4.5. \n\nAlthough the production costs vary with oil prices, this was not considered to keep it simple. The \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nrisk curve obtained is shown in Figure 4.8 along with the values of NPV for the representative \n\nmodels. \n\nAt the end of the uncertainty and risk analysis stage, the decision maker decides whether to \n\ncontinue or to end the process based on the risk curve. The risk level indicates if the acquisition \n\nof new information is necessary to reduce the reservoir uncertainties.  \n\nIn the case studied, the NPV has a variation of approximately US$ 3 billion. The NPV \n\nvariation was considered a high value confirming the need for more information. Thus, the \n\nprocess to estimate the chance of success continues. \n\n \n\nTable 4.5.

Representative Models Selection \n\nIn the case studied the acquisition of 4D seismic data shows which of the possible scenarios \n\nrepresents the true earth model. The chance of success is related to the impact on the reservoir \n\nmanagement after the acquisition of the information. \n\nAs it would be time-consuming to estimate the impact of 4DS acquisition for all possible \n\nscenarios for a specific production period, it is necessary to select simulation models that \n\nrepresent the reservoir uncertainties variation. \n\nThe representative models were chosen based on production data (RF, Np and Wp) versus \n\neconomic data (NPV) cross plots. The selection of the representative models can be done several \n\ntimes, with the objective to improve the EVOI accuracy (Figure 4.1). Each loop is called a stage, \n\nthe number of stages is such that the difference between the EVOI calculated from consecutive \n\nstages is less than 5%.  \n\nIn the current study, the representative models selection was done in four stages. The \n\nproduction and economic results of all representative models are presented in Table 4.6.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.6.

Acquisition Period Estimation \n\nThe ability of seismic data to identify heterogeneities and to improve reservoir modeling \n\nvaries over the production period. The relationship between the reservoir fluid flow and 4D \n\nseismic data capacity to improve the reservoir model was described in Chapter 2. A first \n\nestimative of the best time for 4D seismic acquisition was obtained applying the methodology \n\ndescribed in Chapter 3. \n\n4.7.3.1. Dynamic Data Analysis \n\nThe water saturation error was obtained by comparing the water saturation map from each \n\nscenario with the water saturation map from the base model. The comparison is made with the \n\nbase model because the production strategy applied to each scenario is the same as the base \n\nmodel production strategy. \n\nThe water saturation curves and the normalized curves were computed using Equation 3.1 \n\nand 3.2. The graphs obtained are shown in Figures 4.24 and 4.25. The black curves are the \n\nrepresentative models considered in Stage 04. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24. Water saturation error. \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25. Normalized water saturation error. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 shows if there will be a significant difference between the fluid flow to identify \n\nwhether the model considered (base model) is incorrect (that is, different from the true earth \n\nmodel).  \n\nIn practice a history matching process would be performed and the resulting reservoir \n\nmodel would be closer to the true earth model. In this work, as the information is considered \n\nperfect, the acquisition of information allows to identify the true earth model represented by each \n\nscenario.  \n\nThere are scenarios in which reservoir characteristics are similar to the base model resulting \n\nin low errors and, on the other hand, scenarios highly different from the base model resulting in \n\nhigh errors. \n\nFigure 4.24 also shows that in the initial production phase the errors values are not \n\nsignificant. This occurs due to the low fluid flow and indicates the absence of significant \n\nuncertainties, such as a secondary reservoir.  \n\nHowever, at the end of production there are high values of water saturation errors. The high \n\nvalue indicates the existence of remaining oil areas. The identification of remaining oil areas is \n\nmore difficult to be obtained with other sources of data than 4D seismic data. \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nIn Figure 4.25, the normalized water saturation error identifies when the difference between \n\nthe base model and each scenario is highest (normalized error equal to one). A first estimative of \n\nthe period to acquire 4D seismic data would be at 70% of the normalized water saturation error.  \n\nFigure 4.26 shows the histogram of normalized errors at five years of production. The error \n\nis between 60 and 95%, indicating that the water saturation difference between the scenarios and \n\nthe base model may be enough to identify that the base model does not represent the true earth \n\nmodel.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26. Histogram of normalized Sw error at five years of production. \n\n \n\n4.7.3.2. Production Data Analysis \n\nThe second factor to be analyzed is the time for breakthrough. Figure 4.27 shows a \n\nhistogram of breakthrough time. The production wells of all scenarios were considered.  \n\nFigure 4.28 shows the cumulative distribution of BT: with five years of production, the \n\nbreakthrough had occurred to approximately 55% of the production wells. \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27.

Acquisition Period Estimation \n\nA first estimate of the acquisition period is before five years of production. The acquisition \n\nperiod was estimated based on: (1) the fluid flow differences between the base model and the \n\nreservoir scenarios and (2) the time for breakthrough. \n\nWithin this period, the benefits provided by the acquisition of new information depend on \n\nthe production strategy optimization. The chance of success of 4D seismic data was estimated for \n\nfive years of production. Such period indicates some potential to mitigate the development risk.  \n\n4.7.4. Production Strategy Optimization \n\nThe acquisition of new information at the production period defined in the previous step \n\nimpacts the production strategy. The identification of the true earth model represented by each \n\nscenario improves the reservoir management from the moment that information is obtained. \n\nThe time to process 4D seismic data was not considered because the case analyzed is \n\nsynthetic. Thus, the optimization was performed after five years of production.  \n\nThe objective function was the NPV and the costs considered in the analysis are presented \n\nin Table 4.5. The optimization considered the following actions: \n\n \n\n? Drilling of a new well (addition or replacement): consists of stopping production or \n\ninjection wells and drilling a new well to replace it. The drilling of one new well was \n\nconsidered due to the high number of production and injection wells; \n\n? Production or injection wells recompletion: shutting off one or more production or injection \n\nperiods; \n\n? Production constraints changing: variations on the water cut and maximum surface oil rate \n\nvalues in order to improve the production efficiency. \n\n \n\nAppendix C presents the description of the production strategy improvement for the \n\nrepresentative models RM1 and RM2. It describes the well control constrains, the objective \n\nfunctions that were evaluated and the results obtained for each action. The same procedure was \n\nused to optimize the production strategy from RM3 to RM11. \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nFigures 4.29 to 4.39 show the final production strategy with the position of the new well \n\ndrilled after five years of production for all representative models.  \n\nTable 4.12 shows the water cut considered in the optimized production strategy for the \n\nrepresentative models RM1 and RM5 and maximum surface oil rate considered for RM1.  \n\nThe water cut considered in the production strategy for the representative models RM2 to \n\nRM4 and RM6 to RM11 is equal 0.95. The maximum surface oil rate was not included in the \n\nproduction strategy of the representative models RM2 to RM11. \n\nTable 4.13 presents the economic and production results obtained with the optimized \n\nproduction strategy. The index ?NPV represents the difference between the NPV using the base \n\nproduction strategy and the NPV using the specific production strategy for each model. \n\nThe ?NPV from the base model is equal to zero; in such case if the information identifies \n\nthat the base model represents the true earth model the same production strategy would be used in \n\nthe reservoir management. The results obtained for the remaining representative models vary \n\nconsiderably. \n\n \n\nTable 4.12.

The process of regenerating the \n\nreservoir scenarios considering a new base model production strategy occurred in the current \n\nstudy.  \n\nHowever, sections 4.6.1 and 4.6 showed the results obtained considering the optimal base \n\nproduction strategy. The initial base model production strategy description and production data \n\nresults from the corresponding scenarios are presented in Appendix B. \n\n4.7.5. Chance of Success  \n\nThe expected value of information and the cumulative probability of the increase on the \n\neconomic return were determined to estimate the chance of success.  \n\n4.7.5.1. Expected Value of Information \n\nA decision tree was used to represent the decision process of whether or not acquire 4D \n\nseismic data to estimate the EVOI.  \n\nIn the decision tree, the branch called \u201cDo not acquire 4DS\u201d represents all possible \n\noutcomes if no information is acquired. In such case, it is assumed that the base model production \n\nstrategy maximizes the expected monetary value (EMV).  \n\nThus, the production strategy applied to obtain all possible outcomes considers the \n\nproduction strategy of the base model, as shown in Equation 4.4. If the true earth model is not \n\nrepresented by the base model, but instead, by any of the representative models, the opportunity \n\nof improving the production strategy is lost.  \n\nThe branch called \u201cAcquire 4DS\u201d represents a decision node. In such case, the decision \n\nmaker chooses after the information gathering which strategy to use in the reservoir management.  \n\nThe possible outcomes were determined by applying the production strategy specifically \n\ndesigned for each possible scenario as shown in Equation 4.5. The improvement in the \n\nproduction strategy indicates the impact of new information on reservoir management. \n\nThe decision tree for the four stages of representative models selection are presented in \n\nFigures 4.40 to 4.43. The EVOI obtained for Stage 1 is much lower than the EVOI obtained using \n\nmore representative models. Stage 01 was performed as a test to verify if the increment on the \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nNPV for the extreme models would be the maximum possible values. The verification is done in \n\nthe Section 4.7.5.2. \n\nThe difference in the EVOI values between Stages 2 and 3 is equal 19% and the difference \n\nbetween Stage 3 and 4 is equal 4%. There is a variation on the EVOI as more representative \n\nmodels are added to the process. It was assumed that the maximum difference between the stages \n\nwas 5%, in order to obtain an accurate EVOI.  \n\nThe EVOI is equal to US$28.9 million for the acquisition of information at five years of \n\nproduction,. The EVOI obtained was compared to the VOI considering the true earth model. The \n\ntrue earth model is known because the methodology was applied to a synthetic reservoir model.  \n\nThe VOI obtained was equal to US$25.5 million. The VOI was determined by comparing \n\nthe NPV applying the base production strategy and the NPV applying a production strategy that \n\nmaximizes the economic results for the true earth model. The number of representative models \n\nused to calculate the EVOI provided an accurate value. \n\nUsually the EVOI is compared to the cost of 4D seismic data acquisition and processing to \n\ndefine whether or not acquire the information. It was considered that the cost of 4D seismic data \n\nis equal to US$30 million, with the reference date at 01/01/2008.  \n\nHowever, the EVOI is a weighted measure. It does not show the variation on the NPV \n\nincrease due to the information acquisition. Thus, a new method of evaluation that considers the \n\nNPV increase variation was designed and is presented in the Section 4.7.5.2. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.40.

Increase on the Economic Return \n\nThe evaluation of the increase on the economic return is performed through the cumulative \n\nprobability of the increment on the NPV. The probability distribution curve is determined using \n\ninverse cumulative probability and associated ?NPV values for the representative models. It \n\nidentifies the minimum and maximum possible increase on the economic return that the \n\nacquisition of new information would provide.  \n\nThe cumulative probability curve was determined for Stages 1 to 4 and is presented in \n\nFigure  4.44. Comparing all stages, there is a high variation on the values of ?NPV for a specific \n\nprobability value. The more representative models are used, the more accurate is the cumulative \n\nprobability curve.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.44.

However, Stages 2, 3 and 4 showed the existence \n\nof representative models with higher values of ?NPV. It was not possible to define a correlation \n\nbetween the representative models and the increase on the economic return. \n\nFigure 4.44 shows that another Stage should be evaluated, because there is a high variation \n\nin the probability density curves. However, it was assumed that Stage 4 can be used to evaluate \n\nthe chance of success, because the variation on the EVOI was lower than 5%.  \n\nEvaluating Stage 4 curve, the probability of the increase on the NPV to be higher than 4D \n\nseismic acquisition and processing costs is equal to 44%. Such information better supports the \n\ndecision maker on whether or not acquire 4D seismic data. The decision depends on the risk \n\naversion of the decision maker. \n\n4.7.6. Decision Maker Evaluation \n\nBased on the data provided by the chance of success analysis, the decision maker can \n\nchoose the following actions: \n\n? End the evaluation process: \n\no Acquire 4D seismic data; \n\no Do not acquire 4D seismic data. \n\n? Continue the evaluation process: \n\no Select more representative models to improve the estimation accuracy;  \n\no Evaluate a different acquisition period; \n\no Improve optimization process. \n\n \n\nIn the current study, the EVOI is lower than the acquisition and processing costs and the \n\nprobability that the increase on the economic return is equal 44%. If the decision maker is risk \n\nneutral and the minimum probability acceptance is equal 50%, it could be decided not to acquire \n\n4D seismic data.  \n\nMoreover, production data itself could reduce the reservoir uncertainties at the beginning of \n\nproduction. The production results for all scenarios (Figures 4.5 to 4.7) shows that Np and BHP \n\nresults could be used to reduce reservoir uncertainty. \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\nHowever, the benefit of risk mitigation was not considered and it can justify the acquisition \n\nof new information. Furthermore, other the existence of unknown unknowns can increase the \n\nEVOI and the economic return.  \n\n4.8. Conclusions \n\nDetermine the chance of success of a 4D seismic project before the information acquisition \n\nis necessary to support the decision maker on whether or not acquire new data. A methodology is \n\nproposed to determine a first estimative and it is applicable to fields in the development phase.  \n\nThe methodology is simple and is divided into six steps. Some of the procedures used in the \n\nmethodology are well established in the literature, such as the decision tree technique and value \n\nof information calculation. Three are the main contributions provided by the thesis: \n\n \n\n? The chance of success analysis is performed at the best time for 4D seismic acquisition. If \n\nthe result obtained at such period does not indicate that 4D seismic data can improve the \n\neconomic return of the project, the use of continuous acquisition also would not be viable. \n\nThe methodology to determine the best time to acquire 4D seismic data is described in \n\nChapter 3 and it is incorporated to the chance of success methodology; \n\n? The chance of success is determined by calculating the probability of the increase on the \n\neconomic return to be higher than the acquisition and processing costs. The use of only \n\nEVOI does not show the variation in the increase on the economic return and does not \n\ndetermine the probability of success; \n\n? It is an iterative process in which the evaluation can be performed to different production \n\nperiods and the accuracy of the results can be increased with the selection of more \n\nrepresentative models. \n\n \n\nThe number of representative models is an important step in the methodology. The more \n\nrepresentative models are selected the more accurate are the results obtained. The selection can \n\nbe done in stages until the variation of EVOI between the stages is less than 5%. However, \n\nfurther studies are necessary to determine the minimum number of representative models in order \n\nto obtain an accurate cumulative probability curve \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\nThe methodology was applied to a synthetic reservoir model in order to test its \n\napplicability. The chance of success was determined considering the acquisition at five years of \n\nproduction.  \n\nThe selection of representative models was performed in four stages. The variation on the \n\nEVOI due to the number of representative models considered could be verified.  \n\nThe EVOI obtained is equal US$28.9 million and it is similar to the VOI calculated \n\nconsidering the true earth model that is US$25.5 million.  \n\nA better way to evaluate the chance of success is to obtain the cumulative probability curve \n\nof the increase on the economic return. The probability of success is equal 44% to the case \n\nstudied, considering the acquisition and processing costs equal to US$ 30 million,.  \n\nThe EVOI and probability obtained are low because approximately 98% of the \n\nrepresentative models have a recovery factor of more than 50% and there is low flexibility on the \n\nproduction strategy improvement.  \n\nThe main benefit of 4D seismic data relies on identifying the remaining oil areas. However, \n\nother factors that influence on the results obtained should be considered. There are many \n\ninfluence factors that can increase or decrease the value of information.  \n\nThe quantification of such factors should be subject of further studies. The EVOI can be \n\nincreased due to the existence of unknown uncertainties and the existence of future uncertainties, \n\nsuch as oil price. The EVOI can be reduced because 4D seismic data is imperfect information and \n\nother sources of data can reduce the reservoir uncertainties. \n\n  \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe present thesis describes the development of a methodology to estimate the chance of \n\nsuccess of a 4D seismic project from the reservoir engineering perspective. The methodology was \n\ndeveloped in three phases, each one described in Chapters 2 to 4. \n\nChapter 2 evaluated the impact of 4D seismic data in the history matching process. 4D \n\nseismic data improved the production forecast and most importantly improved the fluid behavior \n\nunderstanding for all production periods analyzed.  \n\nAlthough production data itself improved the production forecast when breakthrough \n\noccurs, the water saturation error increased at least 105% while the use of 4D seismic data \n\nreduced the error at least 76%. \n\nThe water saturation error quantifies the improvement on the reservoir model dynamic data. \n\nMoreover, it identifies which scenarios have a fluid flow different from the base model and the \n\nexistence of remaining oil areas. \n\nThe time for 4D seismic data acquisition affects the value of 4D seismic data. The best \n\nperiod for the information acquisition was between 2 and 4 years of production, for the case \n\nstudied in Chapter 2. \n\nAt such period, it is possible to predict the water breakthrough occurrence and consequently \n\nmake decisions that could delay it. There is enough water saturation error to identify that the base \n\nmodel is incorrect and the revenue to be obtained from oil is between 70% and 45%. \n\nAs Chapter 2 showed the importance of the acquisition period on the 4D seismic value, \n\nChapter 3 treated this task in a more practical condition. It was developed a methodology to \n\nobtain a first estimative of the best time for 4D seismic data. The estimative of the best time is \n\ndetermined by evaluating the production and dynamic data of all possible scenarios. \n\nThe production data analysis evaluates the time for water breakthrough at production wells. \n\nThe acquisition of 4D seismic data shall be before water breakthrough occurs because decisions \n\ncan be made in order to delay the breakthrough and increase the oil production rate as a \n\nconsequence. \n\nThe dynamic data analysis evaluates the water saturation error curves. The acquisition \n\nperiod shall be at the moment in which only 4D seismic data identifies that the base model does \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nnot represent the true earth model and there is enough time to make decision changes. It is \n\nconsidered that a normalized water saturation error equal 70% is sufficient to the true earth model \n\nidentification. \n\nChapter 3 presented a general methodology to estimate the chance of success of 4D seismic \n\ndata acquisition. It was designed to perform the evaluation before the data acquisition and at the \n\nfield development phase.  \n\nThe methodology is simple and iterative process. It is dived in six steps in which some of \n\nthem are well established in the literature. The optimization of production strategy is the most \n\ntime-consuming step. Three are the main contributions provided by the thesis:  \n\n \n\n? The analysis is performed at the best time for 4D seismic acquisition;  \n\n? In general, the decision of whether or not acquire 4D seismic data is based on the EVOI. \n\nHowever, the EVOI is a weighted measure. It does not show the variation in the increase on \n\nthe economic return and does not determine the probability of success. Thus, the \n\nprobability of the increase on the economic return to be higher than the acquisition and \n\nprocessing costs is determined; \n\n? It is an iterative process in which the evaluation can be performed to different production \n\nperiods and the accuracy of the results can be increased with the selection of more \n\nrepresentative models. \n\n \n\nThe number of representative models used in the methodology affects the EVOI and the \n\nprobability of success results. The representative models selection can be done in stages until the \n\nvariation of EVOI between the stages is less than 5% and there is no variation on the probability \n\ndensity curve. \n\nThe methodology was successfully applied to a synthetic reservoir model. The chance of \n\nsuccess was determined considering the acquisition at five years of production. There is no \n\ncorrelation between the representative models and the increase on the economic return due to \n\ninformation acquisition. \n\nThe EVOI obtained is equal US$28.9 million and it is similar to the VOI calculated \n\nconsidering the true earth model that is US$25.5 million. The probability of success is equal \n\n44%, considering the acquisition and processing costs equal to US$ 30 million.  \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\nThe EVOI and probability obtained are low because approximately 98% of the \n\nrepresentative models have a recovery factor of more than 50% and there is low flexibility on the \n\nproduction strategy improvement. The main benefit of 4D seismic data relies on identifying the \n\nremaining oil areas  \n\nDetermine chance of success of a 4D seismic project is important to support the decision \n\nmaker in the industry daily routine. The methodology presented in the thesis was developed \n\nconsidering important assumptions that affect the final results. Below is a list of \n\nrecommendations for future work: \n\n \n\n? Quantify the impact of the existence of unknown uncertainties, the fact that information is \n\nnot perfect and the capacity of other source of data to reduce the reservoir uncertainties; \n\n? Evaluate the impact of the number of representative models on the cumulative probability \n\ncurve and define the minimum number to obtain an accurate value; \n\n? Incorporate the risk mitigation benefit into the valuation of the information. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBALLIN, P. R.; WARD, G. S.; WHORLOW, C.

These models are complex systems, typically \n\ncharacterized by a vast number of input parameters. Usually the physical state of the reservoir is \n\nhighly uncertain, and thus the appropriate parameters of the input choices. The uncertainty \n\nanalysis often proceeds by first calibrating the simulator against observed production history and \n\nthen using the calibrated model to forecast future well production. Most models go through a \n\nseries of iterations before being judged to give an adequate representation of the physical system. \n\nThis can be a difficult task since the input space to be searched may be high dimensional, the \n\ncollection of outputs to be matched may be very large, and each single evaluation may take a \n\nlong time. As the uncertainty analysis is complex and time consuming; in this appendix, a \n\nstochastic representation of the computer model was constructed, called an emulator, to quantify \n\nthe reduction in the parameter input space due to production data over different production \n\nperiods. The emulator methodology represents a powerful and general tool in the analysis of \n\ncomplex physical models such as reservoir simulators. Such emulation techniques have been \n\nsuccessfully applied across a large number of scientific disciplines. The emulator methodology \n\nwas applied to evaluate the production data capacity to identify uncertain reservoir physical \n\nfeatures over the production period for a synthetic reservoir simulation model. The synthetic \n\nmodel was built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. In the case studied, \n\nthousands of realizations were required to identify certain physical reservoir features. This \n\njustifies the use of emulation and shows the importance of this technique for the identification of \n\nregions of feasible input parameters. Moreover, the impact on the input space reduction due to \n\ndifferent production periods was determined. The emulator methodology used assists in carrying \n\nout tasks that require computationally expensive objective function evaluation, such as \n\nidentifying regions of feasible input parameters; making predictions for future behavior of the \n\nphysical system and investigating the reservoir behavior.  \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nReservoir simulators are important and widely-used in reservoir management. It is used in \n\nthe reservoir performance prediction and in the decision making process. These simulators are \n\ncomputer implementations of high-dimensional mathematical models for reservoirs, where the \n\nmodel inputs are physical parameters and the outputs are observable characteristics such as well \n\npressure measurements, fluid production and so forth. The uncertainties are always present in the \n\nreservoir characterization process, thus the input parameters are usually uncertain so is the \n\nsimulator output.  \n\nThe procedure to calibrate the reservoir simulation model is called history matching. Based \n\non observed data, the set of possible input choices for the reservoir model is identified. Two \n\ndifferent procedures can be used to perform the history match process: the deterministic and the \n\nprobabilistic approach. \n\nThe deterministic approach involves running the initial simulation model with different \n\ninput values to obtain one simulation model between many probable matches to the field data. \n\nAccording to Elrafie et al. (2009), the conventional procedure does not handle the uncertainty of \n\nall model variables and the possibility to identify and carry forward a set of multiple history \n\nmatch model scenarios to predictive forecasting. \n\nIn a probabilistic approach, in which several reservoir model scenarios are considered, the \n\nuncertainty analysis procedure is used in the process. Identifying the input parameters for which \n\nthe simulation outputs match the observed data, can be a difficult task because the input space to \n\nbe searched may be high dimensional, the collection of outputs to be matched may be very large, \n\nand each single evaluation may take a long time. \n\nTo deal with the large number of iterations and high computational resources commonly \n\nencountered in the probabilistic approach, proxy models are used. Zubarev (2009) define proxy \n\nmodels as a mathematically defined function that replicates the simulation model output for \n\nselected input parameters. Several papers show the use of different proxy-modeling algorithms in \n\nthe history matching process (Cullick, 2006; Junker et al., 2006 and Slotte and Smorgrav, 2008). \n\nAs the history match process and uncertainty reduction quantification is complex and time \n\nconsuming; the current appendix shows the workflow used to quantify the reduction in the \n\nparameter input space due to production data over different production periods. The workflow \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\ncomprises the construction of a proxy model called an emulator. The emulator technique was \n\napplied to a synthetic reservoir simulation model, built to represent a region of an injector and \n\nrelated producers. \n\nThe emulator represents a powerful and general tool in the analysis of complex physical \n\nmodels such as reservoir simulators. Such emulation techniques have been successfully applied in \n\nreservoir simulation problems, as seen in Cumming &amp; Goldstein (2009), and references therein. \n\nObjective \n\nDescribe a workflow to evaluate the production data capacity to identify uncertain reservoir \n\nphysical features over the production period using the emulation technique. Moreover, show the \n\napplication for a synthetic reservoir simulation model built to represent a region of an injector \n\nand related producers. \n\nProposed Methodology \n\nThe workflow used to construct the emulator is presented. It is important to highlight that a \n\nsynthetic reservoir model is used. There is no historical data available in the process, thus the \n\nproduction data considered as historical data derived from a hypothetical reality selected from \n\npossible scenarios. These scenarios were obtained through an uncertainty analysis performed on \n\nthe initial reservoir simulation model. \n\nThe workflow was designed to quantify the simulation reservoir model uncertainty \n\nreduction due to production data. The objective was to identify the inputs of a reservoir \n\nsimulation model, within a possible input parameter space, whose outputs match to the \n\nhypothetical historical production data. The workflow used is shown in Figure  A1. Each stage is \n\ndescribed as follows. \n\n \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\n \n\nFigure A.1. Process to perform uncertainty reduction quantification. \n\n \n\nInput and Output Parameter Definition \n\nIn reservoir simulation, uncertain inputs are physical parameters determined through an \n\nuncertainty analysis performed on the base model. The outputs of the model are observable \n\ncharacteristics such as well-bottom-hole pressure, water rate at production wells and water \n\nsaturation maps. The input variable selection depends on the underlying problem and knowledge \n\nof the engineer. \n\nThe physical state of the reservoir uncertainty varies due to the amount of information \n\navailable and production period. As in the current study, the analysis is being performed in the \n\nfield development phase; the uncertainty of the appropriate choices of the input parameters for \n\nthe reservoir model is high. \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\nInput Data Set Sampling \n\nThe input data set sampling is an important stage in creating an adequate emulator. \n\nDifferent sampling methods exist and have been applied in reservoir simulations. The Latin \n\nHypercube Design (LHD) is efficient and was selected as a sampling method to this work. \n\nScenarios were generated based on the input parameter space and sampled using the LHD. The \n\nselected scenarios were simulated using commercial simulation software to obtain the production \n\noutputs. The sampled input parameters and resulting simulation outputs were used to construct \n\nthe emulator. \n\nEmulator Estimation \n\nThe emulator is an approximation of the existing numerical reservoir model. It should be \n\nable to replicate the response of a simulated model. The general structure to develop the emulator \n\nwas based on Cumming &amp; Goldstein (2009) and Vernon et al. (2013) and is as follows. \n\nThe simulator is represented by a vector function, taking inputs x which represent the \n\nvector of reservoir input parameters, and return the output parameter f(x). The output parameter \n\nf(x) intends to represent the real physical system output y. The field observed outputs is \n\nrepresented by z, as field observation is susceptible to measurement errors, the difference \n\nbetween z and y is represented by \n\nz=y+e,                                                                                                                                                       (A1) \n\n \n\nwhere e is the vector of random observational errors, taken to be independent of y. If f(x) was a \n\nperfect representation of the system, then an input vector x* only would be accepted as \n\nrepresenting the system if f(x*) = y. In practice, however, the simulation reservoir model f \n\nsimplifies the physics and approximates the solution of the resulting equations. Therefore, the \n\nstructural discrepancy is represented by \n\ny=f(x*)+?,                                                                                                                                                 (A2) \n\n \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\nwhere ? is the random structural discrepancy vector and is independent of f(x*). Combining \n\nEquation A1 and Equation A2 the input parameters x* is acceptable if it is probabilistically \n\nconsistent with the relation \n\nz=f(x*)+?+e,                                                                                                                               (A3) \n\n \n\nThe objective is to identify all choices of x* which would give acceptable fits to available \n\nproduction data or to identify a wide range of elements x* belonging to the input parameter space \n\nX(z). If the input parameter space was low dimensional, and the function was very fast to \n\nevaluate, then it would be possible to estimate X(z) by evaluating the function in the entire space \n\nand identify the collection of all x* choices consistent with Equation A3. However, for a \n\nreservoir simulation model it is infeasible to evaluate the simulator at enough choices to search \n\nthe input space exhaustively. Therefore, a representation of the output uncertainty at each input \n\nchoice must be constructed. This representation is termed an emulator. \n\nThe emulator both suggests an approximation to the function and also contains an \n\nassessment of the likely magnitude of the error of the approximation. The form for emulation of \n\noutput component   ? is \n\n  ?( )  ?        ( )    ( ),                                                                                                      (A4) \n\n \n\nwhere x are the input variables, i is the output being emulated, j is the number of function \n\nelements, B = {?ij} are unknown scalars, gij are known deterministic functions of x and ui(x) \n\nexpress local variation with constant variance. In this work multiple linear regression was used to \n\ndetermine B, gij and ui; therefore the following assumptions must be satisfied: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Linearity: expected value of u(x) must be equal zero, E(u)=0; \n\n\u2022 Homoscedasticity and Independence of Errors: Var(u) = ?\u00b2 and Cov(ui,uj) = 0. \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\nEmulator Diagnostics \n\nEmulator diagnostics is the process of assessing an emulator\u2019s prediction accuracy and \n\nquality. The response values predicted by the emulator must comprise the results of the full \n\nnumerical simulation for the input dataset. Moreover, two measures were evaluated. The first is \n\nthe squared multiple correlation (R\u00b2); according to Rice (1995) this coefficient is used as a crude \n\nmeasure of the strength of a relationship and the second measure is the standard error (?) which \n\noffers a first handle on how well the fitted equation fits the sample data. These measures are \n\n     \n   \n\n   \n and                                                                                                                       (A5) \n\n \n\n  ?\n   \n\n   \n                                                                                                                                    (A6) \n\n \n\nwhere RSS is the residual sum of squares obtained by calculating the square difference between \n\nthe fitted and observed value; RYY is the total sum of squares obtained by calculating the square \n\ndifference between the fitted and mean observed value; n is the number of data points and p is the \n\nnumber of parameters to be estimated (ZUBAREV,, 2005). \n\nRice (1995) comments that, it is necessary to evaluate the residuals to assess the quality of \n\nthe fit. Plots of the residuals versus the fitted values were used to find failures of assumptions. \n\nIdeally the residual should show no relation to the x values, and the plot should look like a \n\nhorizontal blur.  \n\nImplausibility Analysis \n\nThe implausibility analysis is performed to obtain the input parameters whose outputs \n\nmatch the hypothetical historical data. The hypothetical historical data is derived from a \n\nhypothetical reality selected from all possible scenarios generated in the uncertainty analysis; \n\nmoreover these inputs are obtained to improve the emulator reliability and to evaluate the \n\nuncertainty reduction at the end of the process. \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\nThe range of input parameters that are member of X(z) is determined through the \n\nimplausibility value calculation (I). For each set of input parameters an emulator output   ?( ) is \n\nobtained; with this data the implausibility value is \n\n  \n ( )  \n\n(      ? ( ) )\n \n\n   [ ? ( )]                \n,                                                                                                           (A7) \n\n \n\nwhere zi is the hypothetical historical output value, E[  ?( )] is the emulator output expected value \n\nand    [ ? ( )]                     are the variances of the emulator output value, structural \n\ndiscrepancy (?) and observational errors (e) respectively. \n\nLarge values of   \n ( ) suggest that it is implausible that x ?  X(z). As for each vector of \n\ninputs x there are many implausibility values, one for each output, the implausibilities are then \n\ncombined. The implausibility value I(x) for a vector of inputs x is considered as being the \n\nmaximum value among all Ii(x) obtained.  \n\nThe input parameters x that satisfy x ?  X(z) are called non-implausible parameters, since in \n\nthe next iteration the same input may be found to be no longer plausible. If the emulator is not \n\naccurate enough or X(z) does not enable a better understanding of the reservoir\u2019s physical \n\nfeatures, more simulation runs are designed within the \u2018non-implausible\u2019 regions in the input \n\nspace and the emulation analysis is repeated iteratively; each iteration is called a Wave \n\n(Cumming &amp; Goldstein, 2009; Vernon et al., 2013) \n\nThe maximum acceptable implausibility value cutoff determines whether an input \n\nparameter vector (x) is viewed as non-implausible or not. This value can be defined based on \n\nvarious considerations as discussed in Vernon et al. (2013), but often the cutoff used is equal to \n\nthe critical value of some appropriate distribution, for example the standard normal distribution. \n\nNon-Implausible Inputs Evaluation \n\nThe \u2018non-implausible\u2019 input parameters obtained at the end of the process represent the \n\ninput parameters of the reservoir simulation model, whose outputs match to the hypothetical \n\nhistorical production data. These parameters are evaluated to identify how much production data \n\nimproved the reservoir model understanding.  \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nWhile carrying out these analysis considering different production periods, it is possible to \n\nevaluate the impact of the production period over the reservoir uncertainty reduction. \n\nResults \n\nIt is shown the application of the workflow described in the previous topic to a synthetic \n\nreservoir model built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. The uncertainty \n\nreduction was quantified considering two different production periods: the first at an early stage \n\nof production (1000 days) and the second at an intermediate stage of production (3500 days). \n\nBase Model \n\nThe reservoir simulation model designed in the field development phase is called base \n\nmodel. In this study the base model consists of a five-spot configuration and is structurally \n\nrepresented by a horizontal top at -1000 m, discretized with a 45 x 45 x 1 grid in the x, y and z \n\ndirections, respectively, with a dimension of 40 m in the three directions, totaling 2025 blocks. A \n\nlight oil and Black Oil fluid model was used and presents a constant permeability equal to \n\n500 mD and a constant porosity equal to 20%. The model takes approximately 10 seconds to be \n\nsimulated. The base model were built by Risso (2007) and modified by Machado (2010). The \n\npermeability map is presented in Figure  A2. \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \nFigure A.2. Base model permeability map. \n\nInput and Output Definition \n\nThe reservoir model uncertain input parameters that make up the vector x and that \n\nparameterize the reservoir geology containing a channel, are shown in Figure  A3; a description \n\nand the ranges of these inputs are shown in Table A1. \n\nTable A.1.

Uncertainties sketch. \n\n \n\nSeventeen production output parameters were selected to evaluate the impact of production \n\ndata acquisition in the reservoir model uncertainty reduction. The definition of each is as follows: \n\n? f1(x) to f4(x): production well 01 to 04 bottom-hole pressure (BHP); \n\n? f5(x): injector well bottom-hole pressure (BHP); \n\n? f6(x) to f9(x): production well 01 to 04 water rate; \n\n? f10(x) to f13(x): production well 01 to 04 time to breakthrough (BT). \n\nInput Data Set Sampling \n\nThe selection of the first input data sampling was obtained through the Latin Hypercube \n\nsampling method. Two hundred vectors of inputs x, from the initial input space, were sampled \n\ngenerating 200 scenarios. The probability distribution of all uncertainties was considered \n\nuniform. Figure  A4 shows two dimensional projections of the locations of the 200 input vectors \n\nused. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\n \nFigure A.4. First set of input data values, generated from a LHD of size 200. \n\n \n\nThe generated scenarios were simulated to obtain the production outputs f(x). The sampled \n\ninput parameters and resulted simulation outputs were used to estimate the emulator in the first \n\niteration (Wave 1). The initial input space is reduced at the end of the Wave 1 analysis due to the \n\nimposition of the implausibility cutoff; the new input space then consists of the non-implausible \n\ninput parameters: those whose outputs may match the hypothetical historical data. \n\nIn order to improve the emulators\u2019 quality and reduce even more the input space, a new \n\ndata sample is obtained using the LHD from the non-implausible input space derived from the \n\nWave 1 analysis. The Wave 2 analysis consists of estimating new emulators using this new Wave \n\n2 data sample. The quantity of iterations (Waves) depends on the emulator quality needed, \n\nreduction in the input parameter space, computational and time resources. \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\nEmulator Estimation and Diagnostic \n\nTo estimate the emulator some assumption were adopted: \n\n \n\n? As the study is performed with hypothetical historical data, no measurement errors are \n\nconsidered. Therefore, in this study the observational error is equal to zero; \n\n? There is no structural discrepancy between the simulator and real physical system output, \n\nthus, ? is equal to zero. \n\n \n\nThree interactions (Wave 1, 2 and 3) were needed to obtain the non-implausible input space \n\nX(z) for each of the production period analyzed. For the period of production equal 1000 days, \n\nthe output f10(x) to f13(x) were not used, since there is no water breakthrough at the production \n\nwells up to this period. Moreover, in both cases for Wave 1 analysis only BHP outputs were \n\nemulated; the water rate linear models obtained were not judged to be accurate enough based on \n\ntheir diagnostics. \n\nImplausibility Analysis \n\nTo determine the \u2018non-implausible\u2019 inputs a hypothetical reality was selected from the \n\ninitial input space. The hypothetical reality used has a high permeability channel; its position and \n\npermeability values are shown in Figure  A5 and its input values are presented in Table A2. \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\n \nFigure A.5.

This evaluation \n\nis performed by analyzing the implausibility value obtained. In the case studied the maximum \n\nimplausibility value cutoff was chose to be equal to the 99% critical value of the corresponding \n\nstandard normal distribution, and hence set to 2.576. \n\nA vector from the initial input parameter space is considered non-implausible if the \n\nimplausibility value is less than the cutoff using the emulators obtained in Wave 1, 2 and 3 \n\nanalyses. Table A3 shows the reduction in the parameter space as the implausibility analysis is \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\nperformed over the three waves. The results obtained show the importance of using an emulator \n\nin the uncertainty quantification reduction. The volume of input parameter space considered non-\n\nimplausible was found to be a small proportion of the original input space. \n\n \n\nTable A.3.

The input space considered non-implausible after all Waves analyses \n\nfor the production periods equal to 1000 and 3500 days is shown in Figures A6 and A7, \n\nrespectively. \n\nEach square shows the relation between the corresponding variables; the colors are related \n\nto how close the emulator output obtained using a certain input parameter value match the \n\nhypothetical output value. Red and pink colors represent values closer and not so close, \n\nrespectively, to the hypothetical output value. \n\nAt an early stage of production, Figure A6, it was possible to identify with high accuracy \n\nthe field permeability. The range of x and y channel position was narrowed, but channel length \n\nvalues equal to zero was possible to obtain. Zero values to channel length indicate no channel \n\nexists. It was not possible to obtain significant information about the channel permeability, angle \n\nand width at this stage. \n\n \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n \n\nFigure A.6.

Non-implausible inputs for period of production equal 3500 days. \n\n \n\nFor an intermediate production period, Figure A7, a significant uncertainty reduction is \n\nobtained using production data. In addition to the field permeability, x and y channel position are \n\nclose to the hypothetical reality values. It was possible to better understand the channel length, \n\nhowever no significant information was obtained about the channel permeability and width, \n\nperhaps suggesting a limit to the amount of information that can be obtained from this production \n\ndata (or that more waves could be required). \n\nThe uncertainty reduction can also be seen in Figures A8, to A19. The cumulative oil \n\nproduction, bottom-hole pressure and water rate for the production wells are presented for the \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\ninitial input data set (red lines), scenarios obtained after the uncertainty reduction at 1000 (green \n\nlines) and 3500 (cyan lines) days, with the reality model shown as a single dark blue line. The \n\nproduction data results were obtained by simulating the scenarios using a simulation software. \n\nThere is a significant uncertainty reduction using production data up to 1000 days for most \n\nof the wells, however for production well 03 there are still high uncertainty. The uncertainty at \n\nproduction well 03 was reduced using production data up to 3500 days. Note the strong \n\nagreement for several outputs between the cyan lines and the dark blue line of the reality model, \n\nimplying that we have found many locations in input space that are consistent with the observed \n\ndata. The agreement at late times also implies that we could make accurate predictions of the \n\nfuture behavior of the reality model based solely on the data at 1000 and 3500 days. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A.8.

The workflow was successfully applied to a five-spot \n\nsynthetic case that was built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. The \n\nuncertainty reduction of a reservoir model due to new information acquisition for different \n\nproduction periods was quantified. The field production data used was obtained by considering a \n\nhypothetical reality among all possible scenarios, since the analysis was performed at the \n\ndevelopment stage and used a synthetic model. Two periods of production were evaluated: at an \n\nearly production stage (1000 days) and at an intermediate production stage (3500 days). \n\nThe results obtained showed the importance of using emulators in the uncertainty reduction \n\nquantification and history matching process. The number of input parameters considered non-\n\nimplausible was a small set of the initial input space. At an early stage it was possible to reduce \n\nthe uncertainty by identifying the hypothetical real field permeability and identifying possible \n\nvalues for channel positioning. However, other important physical features were not identified, \n\nsuch as the channel permeability, width and length. At an intermediate stage, the uncertainty \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\nreduction was higher. However, still some important physical features that impact on production \n\nprediction, such as channel permeability and width were not identified; therefore, further steps of \n\nthis research will test the application of the emulation technique with seismic 4D  data to reduce \n\nuncertainty. \n\nNomenclature \n\ne random observational errors vector \n\nf(x) output vector \n\n ?( ) emulated output  \n\ng deterministic function \n\ni output emulated \n\nj number of functions \n\nkc channel permeability \n\nk reservoir permeability \n\nn number of data points  \n\np number of parameters to be estimated  \n\nu local variation \n\nx input vector \n\nx, y, z Cartesian directions \n\nxc channel Cartesian x center value \n\nyc channel Cartesian y center value \n\ny real physical outputs vector \n\nz field observed outputs vector \n\nwc channel width \n\nCov covariance \n\nE expected value \n\nI implausibility value \n\nLc channel length \n\nLDH Latin Hypercube Design \n\nR\u00b2 squared multiple correlation  \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\nRSS residual sum of squares  \n\nRYY total sum of squares  \n\nVar variance \n\nX(z) input parameter space \n\n? scalar \n\n? random structural discrepancy vector \n\n? standard deviation \n\n? channel angle \n\nReferences \n\nCULLICK, A.

It occurred because in the phase of production strategy improvement it was \n\nfound out that the optimal production strategy of the representative model improved the \n\neconomic results from the base model. The reservoir scenarios were generated again considering \n\nthe optimal base production strategy and used in the following chance of success methodology \n\nsteps. The appendix shows the initial base model production strategy description and production \n\ndata results from the corresponding scenarios. \n\nInitial Base Model Production Strategy Description \n\nThe geological and structure of the reservoir model is the same presented in the Item 4.6.1. \n\nThe initial production strategy used consists of eleven production wells and eight water injector \n\nwells. Figure B1 shows a 3D view of the reservoir base model with the injector and production \n\nwells. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B.1. Reservoir initial base model permeability map 3D view. \n\n\n\n148 \n \n\nUncertainty and Risk Analysis \n\nThe reservoir model uncertainty considered was the same presented in the Item 4.6.2. \n\nDiscrete Latin Hypercube was used to generate 500 scenarios. It was considered that all attributes \n\nhave a uniform distribution. The field production results for all scenarios and base model are \n\npresented in Figures B2 to B4. The curves pattern remained the same; however the range of the \n\ncumulative oil production and reservoir pressure presented lower values to the initial production \n\nstrategy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B.2.

There was an increase of \n\n21.2% in the NPV and 7.7% of oil production; thus the chance of success methodology presented \n\nin Chapter 4 used the base model optimal production strategy. \n\n \n\nTable B.1.

The production of the reservoir presents some \n\nconstraints related to the platform size and reservoir properties. The constraints considered in the \n\nreservoir simulation model are: \n\n \n\n? Production well minimum bottom-hole pressure (BHP): 215 kgf/cm\u00b2; \n\n? Production well maximum bottom-hole pressure (BHP): 350 kgf/cm\u00b2; \n\n? Platform maximum total production liquid rate (STL): 23.000 m\u00b3/day; \n\n? Platform maximum total injector water rate (STL): 23.000 m\u00b3/day. \n\n \n\nThe optimization process considered the following actions due to the high number of \n\nproduction and injector wells: \n\n \n\n? Drilling of a one new production or injector well; \n\n? Maximum surface oil rate limitation; \n\n? Water rate control. \n\n \n\nThe performance indicator that defines the best production strategy is the NPV, however \n\nother indicators were verified: \n\n \n\n? Cumulative Oil Production (Np); \n\n? Recovery Factor (RF); \n\n? Cumulative Water Production (Wp). \n\n\n\n152 \n \n\nRM1 Strategy Optimization \n\nThe performance indicators obtained using the base production strategy are presented in \n\nTable C1. The RM1 model quality map (total oil per unit area) was evaluated to identify possible \n\ndrill positions to new production or injector well. The quality maps obtained after 30 years of \n\nproduction from Layers 1 and 6 are presented in Figures C1 and C2.  \n\n \n\nTable C.1.
