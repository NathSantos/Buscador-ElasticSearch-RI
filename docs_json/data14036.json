Nos \nsedimentos marinhos, os hidrocarbonetos s\u00e3o usados como fonte de carbono \ne energia por comunidades bacterianas complexas. Contudo, a efici\u00eancia de \nbiodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o poder\u00e1 ser limitada por fatores ambientais. Este trabalho \naborda o previs\u00edvel impacto das condi\u00e7\u00f5es particulares do mar profundo, da \nacidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos e da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de dispersantes qu\u00edmicos nos processos \nde biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos em ambientes marinhos. Numa primeira \nfase, a fun\u00e7\u00e3o de destoxifica\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria das bact\u00e9rias degradadoras de \nhidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos (HAP) nos sedimentos do mar \nprofundo foi avaliado atrav\u00e9s de uma compila\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel na \nliteratura cient\u00edfica e tamb\u00e9m atrav\u00e9s de uma an\u00e1lise dependente do cultivo \nenvolvendo culturas de enriquecimento de sedimentos de vulc\u00f5es de lama do \nmar profundo. Posteriormente, o impacto interativo da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do oceano e \nda contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por hidrocarbonetos petrog\u00e9nicos em comunidades \nbacterianas b\u00eanticas foi avaliado, em experi\u00eancias de simula\u00e7\u00e3o multifatorial \nem sistema de microcosmo previamente executadas, com sedimentos \nsubsuperficiais estuarinos. Finalmente, foi executado uma experi\u00eancia \nmultifatorial em sistema de microcosmos para avaliar o impacto da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \nde dispersantes qu\u00edmicos em situa\u00e7\u00f5es simuladas de derrame de \nhidrocarbonetos em sedimentos estuarinos portu\u00e1rios. \nOs resultados obtidos, atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise da fra\u00e7\u00e3o cultiv\u00e1vel, indicam que nos \nsedimentos do mar profundo a comunidade bacteriana degradadora de HAP \u00e9 \ndistinta da encontrada noutros sedimentos marinhos devido \u00e0 predomin\u00e2ncia \nde bact\u00e9rias relacionadas com o g\u00e9nero Bacillus. Nos ensaios de \nmicrocosmos, apesar das diferen\u00e7as entre os cen\u00e1rios testados, as \ncomunidades bacterianas revelaram-se em geral, est\u00e1veis. Nos sedimentos \nsubsuperficiais estuarinos, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas impostas foram \nprovavelmente atenuadas pela barreira sedimentar sobrejacente e a \ncomunidade bacteriana pareceu ser est\u00e1vel em termos de estrutura e \natividade. Do mesmo modo, a dispers\u00e3o qu\u00edmica de hidrocarbonetos \npetrog\u00e9nicos, apesar de aumentar a biodisponibilidade de PAH, n\u00e3o alterou \nsignificativamente a composi\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades bacteriana de sedimentos \nsuperficiais estuarinos. Possivelmente, a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via do sedimento \nportu\u00e1rio a polui\u00e7\u00e3o por hidrocarbonetos poder\u00e1 ter condicionado a resposta \nda comunidade b\u00eantica bacteriana \u00e0 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por petr\u00f3leo. \nEm conclus\u00e3o, a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana de hidrocarbonetos \u00e9 um processo \nub\u00edquo em sedimentos marinhos e as comunidades bacterianas degradadoras \nrevelam elevada estabilidade relativamente \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores ambientais.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nOil hydrocarbon biodegradation, Bacterial community, Deep sea sediments, \nEstuarine sediments, Ocean acidification, Chemical dispersants. \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nThe marine sediment compartment is a key sink for naturally and accidentally \nreleased oil hydrocarbons in the marine environment. Here, complex \ncommunities of interacting bacterial species will efficiently use oil hydrocarbons \nas sources of carbon and energy. However, the efficiency of the biodegradation \nprocess can be limited by some near-future scenarios. This work addresses \ndifferent environmental scenarios regarding oil hydrocarbon biodegradation in \nmarine sediments. First, the role of bacteria as primary detoxifiers of polycyclic \naromatic hydrocarbons in deep-sea sediments was evaluated through the \ncompilation of available data and through a culture-dependent analysis of \nenrichment cultures derived mud volcano sediments. Next, the impact of the \ninteractive effects of ocean acidification and oil hydrocarbon contamination was \nfurther analyzed in subsurface estuarine sediments. Finally, the impact of \nchemically dispersed oil in estuarine port sediments is evaluated through a \nmulti-factorial microcosm simulation. \nResults show that , in deep sea mud volcano sediments, the culturable fraction \nof the PAH-degrading bacterial community seems distinct from other \nenvironments, with a predominance of Bacillus-like bacteria. In the microcosm-\nbased assays, despite the differences between them, the overall bacterial \ncommunity exhibit a reliable stability. In subsurface sediments, abiotic changes \ntested were possibly attenuated by the superficial sediment barrier and \nbacterial seem stable to environmental changes. Also, the chemical dispersion \nof oil, despite enhancing PAH concentration, did not impose significant \nalterations to the bacterial community composition at the marine sediment \nsurface. The potential pre-exposure of the port sediment to oil hydrocarbon \npollution may have preconditioned the response of the benthic bacterial \ncommunities to oil contamination. \nIn conclusion, oil-hydrocarbon biodegradation is ubiquitous and communities \nexhibit a structural stability to environmental changes. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nContents \n\nList of Publications

The \n\nextensive documentation of underwater seepage systems and of the most catastrophic oil spills (and the \n\nresearch and technological development they have sparked), has progressively enlarged our knowledge \n\non the biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons at marine sediments. However, much is still unknown \n\nconcerning the metabolic turnover of oil hydrocarbons at the marine sediments and new challenges that \n\nhave or will emerge, will bring new disruptions to the system. For example, although natural seepage \n\nsystems might be the most significant source of oil hydrocarbons in the ocean, a substantial fraction of \n\nthe seeped oil will be degraded immediately at the sediment layer by the local microbial communities. \n\nHowever, the functional role of its heterotrophic members is frequently unknown and considering the \n\nextreme abiotic conditions present in these environments, the bacteria involved in oil hydrocarbon \n\ndegradation here may be useful in biotechnological applications. Also, the rise of carbon dioxide \n\nemissions is projected to reach unprecedented rates, indirectly acidifying the world ocean. This \n\nphenomenon, in combination with oil hydrocarbon pollution, has previously been shown to alter the \n\ncore composition of the active microbial communities at superficial estuarine sediments, potentially \n\naffecting oil hydrocarbon biodegradation. Yet, at the underlying subsurface sediments, where inhumed \n\noil hydrocarbons can persist for decades because of a slow and thermodynamically unfavourable \n\nanaerobic biodegradation, this effect has never been demonstrated. Furthermore, chemical dispersants, \n\nalthough frequently used in the context of emergency responses to oil spill, are controversial since their \n\nnet benefit is uncertain. Their application, in contrary to expectations, has been shown to suppress oil \n\nhydrocarbon biodegradation and increase oil hydrocarbon transfer to sediments, where its impact has \n\nnever been evaluated. \n\nObjectives \n\nThis thesis will broaden our comprehension on the effects of oil hydrocarbon contamination \n\non sediment bacterial communities and its removal by bacterial biodegradation in marine sediments. \n\nMore specifically, three main objectives are proposed: \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n? To determine the bacteria potentially involved in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons at deep sea mud volcano sediments. \n\n? To determine if the surface sediment barrier attenuates the impact of the interactive effects of \n\noil hydrocarbon contamination and acidified seawater on subsurface benthic bacterial \n\ncommunity composition. \n\n? To determine the effect of chemical dispersion of oil contamination on the fate of oil \n\nhydrocarbons and on the bacterial community composition from estuarine sediments obtained \n\nfrom a chronically contaminated port area. \n\nThese proposed objectives will be addressed in Chapter II, Chapter III and Chapter IV, respectively. \n\nThesis Outline \n\nChapter I is composed of two parts. In the first part, a brief and informative literature review \n\nof topics that are considered essential to the understanding of the subsequent chapters is presented. In \n\nthe second part, existing information regarding the role of the deep sea sediments as a potential sink \n\nfor oil hydrocarbons in marine environments is summarized. Here, the interactions between \n\nrecalcitrant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), deep sea sediments, and the local bacterial \n\ncommunity are examined, with emphasis on the functional role of bacteria in the fate of these \n\npollutants considering both current and future climate conditions. \n\nChapter II analyzes the cultivable fraction of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading \n\nbacterial community from in vitro enrichment cultures with added phenanthrene and chrysene as the \n\npredominant carbon sources. Results show that the culturable fractions of the enrichment cultures were \n\ndominated by Bacillus-like isolates. This result was unexpected since Bacillus-like isolates are not \n\ncommonly detected as PAH-degraders in marine environments but is coherent with some studies from \n\nsimilarly extreme environments. \n\nChapter III examines the interactive and independent effects of oil hydrocarbon contamination \n\nand reduced seawater pH on the core bacterial community composition of subsurface estuarine \n\nsediments at two time points. Here, the bacterial community from the subsurface sediments involved in \n\na previously executed multi-factorial microcosm simulation was analyzed through a 16S gene-based mass \n\nsequencing approach. Results revealed that, despite some taxa-specific alterations, the overall bacterial \n\ncommunity was stable to the factors tested, which contrasts with indications from the most superficial \n\nsediments. It is speculated that the super-adjacent sediment barrier may function as a buffer, thus \n\nattenuating the effects of both oil hydrocarbon pollution and reduced seawater pH. \n\nChapter IV examines, for the first time, the potential impact of chemically-dispersed oil on the \n\nbenthic bacterial community composition in estuarine superficial port sediments. A multi-factorial \n\nmicrocosm simulation was planned and executed to test the interactive and independent effects of oil \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nhydrocarbon contamination and dispersant addition. The results obtained indicate the chemical \n\ndispersion of oil increased the mass transfer of PAH to the sediment phase during the experiment and \n\naltered the relative abundance of some lesser abundant putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. \n\nHowever, the overall bacterial community was not affected by t the factors independently and in \n\ninteraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter I \n\n\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nChapter I \n\nI. Bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons in marine environments \n\nOil hydrocarbon contamination in marine environments can be derived from both natural and \n\nanthropogenic sources. Naturally occurring seeps are responsible for an estimate of 47% of the total oil \n\nhydrocarbons released into the ocean [(Kvenvolden and Cooper 2003); Figure I-1]. However, since seep \n\ndistribution may be substantially underestimated, their ultimate contribution may be higher (Kvenvolden \n\nand Cooper 2003). Despite their magnitude, a substantial fraction of oil hydrocarbons emitted are totally \n\nconsumed at the seabed by the local microbial communities, which transfer the assimilated energy and \n\ncarbon into the higher trophic levels, ultimately having a fertilizing effect on the local ecosystem (Coelho \n\net al. 2016b; D'souza et al. 2016; Hovland and Thomsen 1989). Anthropogenically-derived oil \n\nhydrocarbons in marine environments are expected to increase concurrently to the global rise in oil \n\nconsumption (International Energy Statistics 2015; Transportation Research Board and National \n\nResearch Council 2003). Although the stricter maritime vessel regulations, approved in the last decades, \n\nhave considerably reduced oil tanker related spills, new threats are emerging [e.g. riskier offshore oil \n\nextraction projects, a deteriorating infrastructure (Jernel\u00f6v 2010) and the anarchic regulation of vessels \n\nby some flag states (Miller et al. 2015)]. The recent 2010 Deepwater horizon oil spill (DWH) is an \n\nexample that major marine oil spills can recur and still be catastrophic. Also, the continuous release of \n\noil hydrocarbons through minor spills that may occur during production, transport, refining and storage \n\nof petroleum or its derived products, and through the atmospheric deposition of combusted \n\nhydrocarbonous soot is also likely to increase [(Transportation Research Board and National Research \n\nCouncil 2003); Figure I-1]. These sources can chronically contaminate coastal marine environments sited \n\nnear high density urban and industrial areas, seaports and at the mouth of major rivers (Lipiatou et al. \n\n1997; Telli-Karako\u00e7 et al. 2002). Here, hydrocarbon concentrations can be similar or even reach values \n\n100 times higher (He et al. 2014; Telli-Karako\u00e7 et al. 2002) than those measured in sediments surrounding \n\nthe DWH epicentre, one year after blowout (Liu et al. 2012b). \n\nThe Portuguese exclusive economic zone (PEEZ), given its central location in the north \n\nAtlantic, is susceptible to major oil hydrocarbon events. The PEEZ is both a passageway, in the Atlantic \n\nOcean, for vessels moving north to south and east to west, and vice-versa. More importantly, the \n\ncoastline of mainland Portugal is located near a vessel corridor, with intense traffic, that links the North \n\nAtlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through the Gibraltar strait. The \n\nsusceptibility of this region to oil spills is further aggravated by the rough sea conditions found during  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I-1 - Sources of oil in the ocean.

The Iberian western coast has experienced 4 of the 20 largest tanker related \n\noil spills, namely the Jacob Maersk (1975), the Uriquiola (1976), the Aegean Sea (1992) and the most \n\nrecent Prestige (2002) (ITOPF 2013).  \n\nMajor oil spills, although not the main source of oil hydrocarbons in marine environments \n\n(Figure I-1), are catastrophic to local environments since they release a substantial amount of oil in a \n\nrestricted location. To minimize their socio-economic and environmental impact and/or accelerate \n\nrestoration, environmental and civil protection agencies employ a diverse array of oil spill response \n\nstrategies. First response frequently relies on the physical containment and the quick recovery of spilled \n\noil, by use of boomers and skimmers, respectively. These strategies are environmentally benign, but they \n\nare ineffective in harsh meteorological conditions and when spilled oil is substantial and/or outspreaded. \n\nIn these situations, biodegradation by autochthonous heterotrophic microorganisms will be the most \n\nrelevant removal process for oil hydrocarbons (Head et al. 2006). Nonetheless, if not intervened, the \n\ndepletion of some essential metabolic factors (e.g. nutrients and oxygen) and/or the limited \n\nbioavailability of the substrate may limit and retard biodegradations full potential. The use of \n\nbioremediation strategies will attempt to enhance and accelerate this natural biodegradation by \n\ncountering its limiting factors. The application of chemical dispersants is the most frequently employed \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nstrategy (National Research Council 2005; Prince 2015). Nonetheless, its use is controversial among \n\nscientists (Kleindienst et al. 2015a; Kleindienst et al. 2016; Prince 2015; Prince et al. 2016) since its \n\nbenefits may not compensate its increased environmental impact. Chemical dispersants will promote the \n\nformation and the stabilization of micron-size oil-in-water droplets that will increase oils bioavailability \n\nand buoyantly entrain the micelles in the water column, thus restraining them from reaching the seabed. \n\nHowever, although an increase in bioavailability will undoubtedly benefit biodegradation, it may also \n\nincrease the exposure of the marine biota to the toxic constituents of oil (Barron et al. 2003; Shimada \n\nand Fujii?Kuriyama 2004; Wolfe et al. 2001). Chemically dispersed oil has been repeatedly measured to \n\nbe more toxic to marine biota in general (Almeda et al. 2014; Anderson et al. 2014; Barron et al. 2003; \n\nGardiner et al. 2013; Goodbody-Gringley et al. 2013; \u00d6zhan et al. 2014; Rico-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2013) than \n\nnon-dispersed oil and has, inclusively, been found to suppress the activity of hydrocarbon-degrading \n\nbacteria (Kleindienst et al. 2015b). This enhanced toxicity has been correlated with the concentration of \n\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) in the water-accommodated fraction (Gardiner et al. 2013; \n\n\u00d6zhan et al. 2014; Radniecki et al. 2013), which are known to be enhanced by the application of chemical \n\ndispersants (Gong et al. 2014b; Zhao et al. 2016). Also, since biodegradation may instead be limited by \n\nnutrient (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus and iron) and/or oxygen deficiencies, the unnecessary application of \n\ndispersant can further delay biodegradation by augmenting the carbon ratio in the system (Kleindienst \n\net al. 2015a). In this situations, the exogenous supplementation of deficit nutrients (biostimulation) and \n\noxygenation has proved to be more beneficial (Coulon et al. 2007). \n\nOil is a complex carbon-rich mixture of hydrophobic constituents which can be divided into \n\nfour main classes, based on structural properties: aliphatics, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. Each class \n\nhas distinct physico-chemical properties that will influence their ultimate environmental fate. The \n\nconstituents of each class can be progressively divided based on their volatility, solubility and \n\nbiodegradability. Because of this physico-chemical heterogeneity, spilled oil will, with time, change its \n\ncomposition in a process known as weathering. Through weathering, most volatile and most soluble oil \n\nconstituents will progressively evaporate and dissolve. Also, biodegradation will act on oil hydrocarbons \n\ndifferentially, with mid-range saturated linear aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) being preferentially \n\nbiodegraded than, for example, the PAHs and the alkylated aliphatic hydrocarbons (iso-alkanes) (Garrett \n\net al. 1998). Eventually, weathering will reduce oil to a tar remnant, composed by its heaviest and most \n\nrecalcitrant constituents that, by adhering to suspended particulate matter, may settle at the sediments \n\n(Gong et al. 2014a). PAHs, in particular, will be enriched in this remnant. PAHs are problematic \n\nenvironmental pollutants, mainly because their partial metabolism and photooxidation originates \n\noxygenated and highly reactive metabolites (Aeppli et al. 2012; Knecht et al. 2013; Lee 2003; Toyooka \n\nand Ibuki 2007). Consequently, PAHs are considered carcinogenic, mutagenic and overall toxic to \n\nhumans (IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans 2010) and, thus, \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\ntheir concentrations in soil and water are routinely monitored and regulated by public environment and \n\nfood safety agencies (Code of Federal Regulation 2015; Lerda 2010). \n\nDespite environmentally nefarious, oil hydrocarbons are a rich source of carbon and energy for \n\nthe heterotrophic microorganisms capable of degrading them. However, their degradation is limited by \n\npoor bioavailability and low chemical reactivity (Widdel and Musat 2010). Therefore, oil hydrocarbon-\n\ndegrading microorganisms will need to dispend some energy to counter these limitations (Rojo 2009; \n\nWiddel and Musat 2010). For example, by producing biosurfactants , oils bioavailability will increase and \n\nthe transmembrane uptake of oil hydrocarbons by microorganisms will be facilitated (Bouchez et al. \n\n1997; Bouchez Na\u00eftali et al. 1999; Chrzanowski et al. 2012; Noordman and Janssen 2002). In marine \n\nsediments, biosurfactants may further enhance the desorption of oil hydrocarbons from sediment \n\nparticles (Mnif et al. 2014; Nakazawa et al. 2016). Also, due to the absence of a functional group, that \n\nwould facilitate the enzymatic cleavage of their carbon bonds, in hydrocarbon molecule, oil hydrocarbon-\n\ndegrading microorganisms are required to perform an initial metabolic endergonic reaction that would \n\nlead to the formation of an alcohol functionality (Himo 2005; Widdel and Musat 2010). This initial \n\noxygenation involves the activity of oxygenases and requires molecular oxygen as a reactant (Seo et al. \n\n2009). It will increase the chemical reactivity of the oil hydrocarbon (Widdel and Musat 2010), and from \n\nhere a subsequent carboxyl group is enzymatically obtained and the carbon-bond can be cleaved (Seo et \n\nal. 2009). Although it involves a slight input of energy from the bacteria, this oxygenation step is crucial \n\nin oil hydrocarbon biodegradation since, in the end, the energy yield is substantially higher in comparison \n\nto that calculated for direct carboxylation (Rojo 2009; Seo et al. 2009; Widdel and Musat 2010). However, \n\nsince required enzymes are not widespread among microorganisms, as in comparison to those for \n\nsubsequent steps, the initial oxygenation step can be a bottleneck in oil hydrocarbon biodegradation \n\n(Rojo 2009; Seo et al. 2009). \n\nOil hydrocarbons, due to their hydrophobicity and consequent immiscibility with water, have \n\nthe propensity to concentrate at the interfaces. Spilled oil will initially float at the air-water interface but, \n\nwith time, it will accumulate at the sediment-seawater interface, horizontally through the action of waves \n\nand tides and vertically through the sinking of oil-sediment aggregates (Gong et al. 2014a; Romero et al. \n\n2015). Simulations estimate that 65% of spilled oil in the water column will reach sediments through \n\nvertical settling (Bandara et al. 2011). Here, organic particles and clay will adhere strongly to oil \n\nhydrocarbons and entrap them. These adhesion forces between oil hydrocarbons and sediment particles \n\nwill strengthen with time through a phenomenon known as aging (Kim et al. 2009) and will ultimately \n\nlimit oil hydrocarbon bioavailability and, consequently, its biodegradation (Semple et al. 2003). In low \n\nenergy environments (e.g. estuaries), because the organic and clay contents are higher, oil hydrocarbon \n\npollution can be particularly problematic (Semple et al. 2003). Therefore, the sediments are considered \n\nthe most sensitive areas to oil spills and their protection is prioritized during decision-making (Adler and \n\nInbar 2007). Here, the sediment-bound hydrocarbons are quickly inhumed, by sedimentary accretion, \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nfrom a narrow superficial oxic layer to the adjacent anoxic sediments. If not resuspended, they can persist \n\nfor decades (Reddy et al. 2002) because biodegradation is substantially slower in anoxic conditions \n\n(Duran and Go?i-Urriza 2010) and they are occluded from photooxidation (Kim et al. 2009). \n\nThe marine sediment surface is a biological hotspot, where the benthic microbial community is \n\ndenser and more diverse that in adjacent compartments (Duran and Go?i-Urriza 2010; Paiss\u00e9 et al. 2008). \n\nHere, the interactive effort of a multitaxon microbial mat will synergistically enhance oil biodegradation \n\n(Coelho et al. 2016a; McGenity et al. 2012). In this heterotrophic consortium, Bacteria are of vital \n\nimportance because of their versatile enzymatic capabilities (Head et al. 2006; Schmidt et al. 1998). Their \n\npossible functional replacement by Fungi has been shown to comparatively decrease n-alkane removal \n\nin sediments (Coelho et al. 2016a). In Bacteria, aerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation can occur through \n\nthe action of generalist heterotrophic bacteria (e.g. genera Pseudomonas and Bacillus), which are capable of \n\noxidizing other carbon substrates in the absence of oil, and/or through the action of hydrocarbonoclastic \n\nbacteria (Yakimov et al. 2007). Hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria are specialized in the biodegradation of \n\nspecific classes of oil hydrocarbons [e.g. Alcanivorax sp. degrades saturated mid-range n-alkanes and \n\nCycloclasticus sp. specifically degrades PAHs; (Schneiker et al. 2006; Yakimov et al. 2007; Yakimov et al. \n\n1998)] and are more ubiquitous in marine aerobic environments than in terrestrial soils (Rojo 2009). \n\nThey are sparsely present in non-contaminated environments and will respond rapidly to oil input \n\n(Yakimov et al. 2007). As crucial intervenients in the first metabolic step of aerobic hydrocarbon \n\nbiodegradation (oxygenation), they will initially bloom but, gradually, as diversity rises, other \n\nheterotrophic bacteria will appear and feed on oils metabolic intermediates (Vila et al. 2010). Also, with \n\ntime the predominant aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria will change concurrently with oil weathering \n\n(Dubinsky et al. 2013). The initially dominant alkane-degrading bacteria (i.e. Alcanivorax) are progressively \n\nreplaced by PAH-degrading bacteria (e.g. Cycloclasticus) as the concentration of alkanes decreases \n\n(Dubinsky et al. 2013; Terrisse et al. 2017). In the end, as oil disappears, microbial communities may \n\nreturn to its initial pre-spill state (Yang et al. 2014). \n\nUnder anaerobic conditions, biodegradation will occur, but it will be comparatively slower than \n\nin aerobic conditions (Vitte et al. 2011; Widdel and Musat 2010). Alternative electron acceptors to \n\nmolecular oxygen are abundant in sediments and microorganisms are known to efficiently use them in \n\nother metabolic pathways. Yet, in aerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation molecular oxygen is also used as \n\na reactant in the initial activation step. In anaerobic conditions, alternative reactants (more commonly \n\nfumarate, but also water and nitrate) are used, but their energetic yields are substantially lower (Rojo \n\n2009; Widdel and Musat 2010). For example, in hexadecane biodegradation, activation with fumarate \n\nhas a potential free energy gain for the bacteria ten-fold lower than to aerobic oxygenation (Rabus et al. \n\n2001). Anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation is predominantly achieved directly by sulfate-reducing \n\nbacteria in marine intertidal sediments (Davidova et al. 2006) or indirectly through syntrophic \n\nrelationships with these and methanogenic archaea (McInerney et al. 2009). Other common metabolic \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\npathways include hydrocarbon biodegradation coupled to metal reduction [e.g. Fe(IV) and Mn(IV)] \n\n(Dorer et al. 2016). Despite its poor energetic gain, anaerobic biodegradation is still an important via for \n\noil hydrocarbon removal in sediments, particularly in fine-grained sediments. Here, a more superficial \n\nredoxcline layer limits aerobic biodegradation to the most superficial sediments, which in oil \n\ncontaminated environments can be quickly depleted of oxygen because of an increased heterotrophic \n\nactivity. \n\nIn sum, the restoration of oil-impact marine environment can be achieved through the metabolic \n\ninteraction of a multitaxon microbial community. However, and despite the substantial amount of \n\nresearch dedicated to the theme, the mechanistic details of the biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons in \n\nmarine environments are still poorly understood. The functional role of specific microbial groups and \n\nthe microbial dynamics inside the community, remain elusive. Although catastrophic incidents are ideal \n\nsources of new data for research, their occurrence is both undesirable and unpredictable in time and \n\nspace. Therefore, validated microcosm simulations of oil spills are required to answer these surging \n\nquestions. Also, climate alterations induced by global warming (e.g. ocean acidification) may alter the \n\nbaseline of the microbial dynamics of oil hydrocarbon biodegradation in marine environment and should \n\nbe considered when designing these experiments. In the end, a more thorough understanding of the \n\nbiodegradation of oil hydrocarbons in marine environments will incite new oil response strategies and a \n\nmore informative decision-making, certainly benefiting environmental protection. \n\nLiterature Cited \n\n1.

PAHs bioaccumulate through \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\ntrophic webs (Clements et al. 1994; Kanaly and Harayama 2000) and exert acute toxic, mutagenic, \n\nteratogenic and carcinogenic effects on living organisms (Kanaly and Harayama 2000; Menzie et al. 1992; \n\nNeff 2002). PAHs with two and three aromatic rings are considered low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs, \n\nwhile compounds with four or more aromatic rings are known as high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs. \n\nIn Table I-1, we listed the 16 priority PAHs as classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency \n\n(EPA) along with measured and estimated physico-chemical data. Overall, organic carbon-water \n\npartition coefficient (Koc), octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) and half-life values increase with \n\nincreasing numbers of rings, whereas vapour pressure decrease. An increasing number of rings reduces \n\nvolatility, solubility and biodegradation rates, and increases hydrophobicity, adsorption to particulate \n\nmatter, toxicity and recalcitrance (Seo et al. 2009). \n\nBioavailability refers to the forms and quantity of chemicals that biota can take up during their \n\nlives and thus determines how and to what extent these chemicals enter the food chain. In the \n\nbiodegradation of hydrophobic pollutants, bioavailability is important and is expressed as the relative \n\nfraction of a specific pollutant that is available to microbes. Solubility and sorption are important \n\nparameters when considering bioavailability. The first is directly correlated with bioavailability, while the \n\nsecond is affected by various external factors. All PAHs are hydrophobic and lipophilic, and adhere to \n\nsoil particles, if available, in a seawater environment. The 'strength' of this association varies and is \n\nrelated, among other things, to soil properties (Semple et al. 2003). Koc (Table I-1) directly reflects the \n\nsorption capacity of PAHs and increases with increasing number of rings. Sorption also increases with \n\nincreasing soil organic carbon content (Wang et al. 2001) and decreasing pore size (Semple et al. 2003). \n\nIn soot, a carbon-rich matrix, pyrolytic PAHs are highly sorbed and occluded, which reduces their \n\ndegradation in comparison to other surfaces (Kim et al. 2009). At DSS organic carbon content is lower \n\nthan at coastal marine sediments (Nagata et al. 2010) thus PAHs are more bioavailable. Over time, the \n\nrate of desorption of organic pollutants from the matrix decreases exponentially (aging). Aging \n\nfunctionally resumes to the shift from weaker hydrogen and van der Waals to covalent bonds. By aging, \n\nPAH-soil interaction becomes more stable and irreversible (Semple et al. 2003). \n\nPAHs are introduced into the marine environments sporadically through marine oil spills and \n\ncontinuously through urban run-off, industrial and domestic wastewater/sludge discharge, atmospheric \n\ndeposition, ship ballast cleaning, offshore oil exploration and natural seepage (Guitart et al. 2007; Guitart \n\net al. 2010; Notar et al. 2001). PAHs inputs into marine environments can be classified into two groups: \n\npetrogenic and pyrolytic (Ke et al. 2002). Petrogenic sources derive directly from petroleum and \n\nderivatives, while pyrolytic sources derive from the combustion of fossil fuels.

Remediation of oil pollution response rely on physical, \n\nbiological and chemical processes. Biological methods mainly focus on enhancing natural biodegradation \n\nthrough the supplementation of nutrients, surfactants (biostimulation) or microorganisms \n\n(bioaugmentation). Nutrient biostimulation approaches rely on N and P supplementation in the form of \n\ninorganic salts to contaminated areas. Microbial biodegradation of oil pollutants is often limited by the \n\nlow concentrations of bioavailable nitrogen in comparison to carbon. Supplementation of N and P \n\nincreases microbial degradation but is only effective when these elements are limiting. This approach is \n\nmore effective in soil, sand and embayments. In the open ocean, nutrient dispersion significantly reduces \n\nits effectiveness and requires continuous supplementation, which raises costs (Nikolopoulou et al. 2007). \n\nOil degradation is also limited by the reduced oil-water interface, where biodegradation occurs. \n\nApplication of surfactants reduces the interfacial tension and increases oil-water emulsification, \n\nenhancing biodegradation (Hazen et al. 2010). Bioaugmentation (addition of exogenous or endogenous \n\nbacteria) is an overlooked tool in oil spill response and has been deemed ineffective and relatively \n\nexpensive (Megharaj et al. 2011). Maladaptation of the inoculated microorganisms to the new \n\nenvironment constitutes a major barrier to successful bioaugmentation (Churchill et al. 1995). However, \n\nthe use of autochthonous strains could help to overcome this limitation and improve bioremediation \n\nefficiency (Hosokawa et al. 2009) and bioaugmentation with PAH-degrading bacteria, immediately after \n\nspill, can minimize persistent PAH afterwards (Ron and Rosenberg 2014). \n\nThe extension of oil exploration towards deeper ocean introduces novel technological \n\nchallenges and environmental concerns. Therefore, in depth scientific knowledge and new technological \n\nskills need to be developed. Here we focus on the particular features of the deep sea that make it a \n\nrelevant bioremediation site: the origin and fate of PAHs in deep sea sediments and the microbial players, \n\npathways and genes involved in PAHs biodegradation. \n\nBacterial life in the deep sea \n\nIn the present review, deep sea sediments refer to the sea floor below 1000 m depth. This \n\nenvironment is considered extreme because of the challenging conditions to microbial life in terms of \n\nnutrient supply, electron donors and acceptors, and exposure to physical factors such as temperature \n\nand pressure. \n\nThe DSS environment is characterized by high pressure (10\u201350 MPa), low temperatures (2-3\u00baC, \n\nexcept in hydrothermal vents) and low concentration of labile organic carbon. Salinity varies between \n\n34.3\u201335.1 g L-1 and pH between 7.5\u20138.0 (Nagata et al. 2010). Collectively, the data indicate that physico-\n\nchemical conditions of the deep sea environment are more stable than the ocean surface (Nagata et al. \n\n2010). Although the abyssal plains form the major part of the deep sea, other habitats are present and \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\ninclude hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, mud volcanoes, Fe(III)-Mn(IV) nodules, trenches, seamounts \n\nand canyons (Nagata et al. 2000). \n\nMarine sediments, in general, are covered with biofilms of dense and diverse microbial \n\ncommunities (Chipman et al. 2010). They are efficient players in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, \n\nnitrogen and phosphorus (Kostka et al. 2011; Shao et al. 2010; Silva et al. 2003). Life in the deep sea \n\nmainly depends on the input of organic carbon from the ocean above. Dissolved organic carbon in the \n\nsuperficial deep sea sediments varies from 509-1038 \u00b5mol L-1 in the Atlantic Ocean and 672-1529 \u00b5mol \n\nL-1 in the more eutrophic Arabian Sea (Lahajnar et al. 2005). Exogenous organic carbon inputs into the \n\ndeep sea derive from lateral advection from slopes and shelves, diffusion and sinking. Resuspension \n\nfrom bottom sediments by turbulence mixing, chemosynthetic activity and hydrocarbon seeps also \n\ncontributes to the microbial food web. \n\nOrganic matter is continuously degraded by microbes while sinking, leaving behind a refractory \n\nremnant (Nagata et al. 2010). Bacteria in the deep sea are adapted to degrade these recalcitrant \n\ncompounds. Specific adaptations to oligotrophic environments, such as the production of \n\nbioflocculants, have been reported in deep sea bacteria and assist in nutrient and carbon sequestration \n\n(Wu et al. 2013). Deep sea microbial communities have been reported to decompose biodegradable \n\nplastics (Sekiguchi et al. 2011), hydrocarbons, PAHs (Cui et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2008) \n\nand polychlorinated biphenyls (Froescheis et al. 2000). \n\nThe microbial community in the bathypelagic environment has been shown to be surprisingly \n\ndiverse (DeLong et al. 2006; Sogin et al. 2006). Although microbial abundance is relatively stable at 104-\n\n105 cells cm-3 and biomass decreases with depth (Nagata et al. 2000; Nagata et al. 2010; Sogin et al. 2006), \n\nmicrobial diversity has been shown to increase due to the preponderance of low abundance operational \n\ntaxonomic units (OTU) also known as the \"rare biosphere\" (Sogin et al. 2006). The \"rare biosphere\" is \n\nthought to serve as a microbial seed-bank which may increase in relative abundance in response to \n\nenvironmental change (Agogu\u00e9 et al. 2011). Deep sea microbial communities contain numerous novel \n\ntaxa; for example, a culture-independent analysis of an extinct hydrothermal field, revealed that only 4% \n\nof the bacterial sequences had > 94% sequence similarity to sequences from NCBI database (Nercessian \n\net al. 2005).  \n\nA number of studies have reported the composition of DSS bacterial communities (Table I-2) \n\nHowever, these results should be compared with caution due to the variation in molecular techniques \n\nemployed and biases in DNA extraction and PCR amplification protocols that may over- or under-\n\nrepresent certain taxa (Al-Awadhi et al. 2013; Hazen et al. 2013). Overall, Proteobacteria, particularly \n\nbelonging to the ?-, ?- and ?- classes are the most abundant taxa in molecular surveys of DSS microbial \n\ncommunities (Jamieson et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2007; Li et al. 1999; Nercessian et al. 2005; Pachiadaki et \n\nal. 2011; Wu et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2005; Zeng et al. 2005). ?-Proteobacteria the most abundant group in \n\nthe mid-Atlantic ridge's Rainbow hydrothermal vent (?50% of total OTU) (Nercessian et al. 2005), the \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nTable I-2 - List of culture-independent studies of the deep sea benthic bacterial community. \n\nMatrix Location Method Main conclusions Reference \n\nHydrothermal \nvents \n\nRainbow \nHydrothermal \nvent field, Mid \nAtlantic Ridge \n(2300m) \n\n16S rRNA clone \nlibrary \n\nClones correspond to sequences classified as ?- (?50%), \n?-(12%) and ?- Proteobacteria (6%), Planctomycetes \n(8%) and Bacteriodetes (6%) \n\n(Nercessian et al. 2005) \n\nDSS Western Pacific \n\"Warm Pool\" \n(1901m) \n\n16S rRNA clone \nlibraries \n\nClones correspond to ?- (45.3%), ?- (17%) and ?- \n(12.3%) Proteobacteria.

Other relatively abundant taxa include the \n\nCytophaga/Flavobacteria/Bacteroidetes group (Li et al. 1999; Mart\u00edn-Cuadrado et al. 2007; Nercessian \n\net al. 2005; Xu et al. 2005; Zeng et al. 2005), Planctomycetes (DeLong et al. 2006; Jamieson et al. 2013; \n\nMart\u00edn-Cuadrado et al. 2007; Nercessian et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2013; Zeng et al. 2005), Chloroflexi (mainly \n\naffiliated with Dehalococcoidetes (Inagaki and Nakagawa 2008)) (DeLong et al. 2006; Mart\u00edn-Cuadrado \n\net al. 2007; Pachiadaki et al. 2011), Acidobacteria (Mart\u00edn-Cuadrado et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2013), \n\nFirmicutes (Li et al. 1999; Mart\u00edn-Cuadrado et al. 2007; Zeng et al. 2005), CFB group (Xu et al. 2005; \n\nZeng et al. 2005), JS1 candidate division (previously joined with the OP9 candidate division) (Inagaki \n\nand Nakagawa 2008; Inagaki et al. 2006; Inagaki et al. 2003) and Actinobacteria (Jamieson et al. 2013; \n\nWu et al. 2013). Functions such as sulfate reduction in hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have been \n\nmainly attributed to ?- and ?-Proteobacteria (Desulfococcus and Desulfosarcina) (Inagaki et al. 2002; \n\nLongnecker and Reysenbach 2001; Zeng et al. 2005), sulfur oxidation to ?- and ?-Proteobacteria (Inagaki \n\nand Nakagawa 2008), methane oxidation to members of the uncultured candidate division JS1 (Inagaki \n\net al. 2002), ?- and ?-Proteobacteria (Xu et al. 2005) and dechlorination to members of ?-Proteobacteria \n\nand Chloroflexi (Inagaki and Nakagawa 2008). Archaea are also crucial players in the chemosynthetic \n\nactivity of the DSS microbial community, e.g., in the fixation of dissolved inorganic carbon (Herndl et \n\nal. 2005), methane oxidation (Havelsrud et al. 2011) and nitrification (Beman et al. 2008). Archaea have \n\nalso been shown to be relatively more abundant components of DSS microbial communities (Herndl et \n\nal. 2005). The unique physico-chemical conditions of the DSS induce a selective pressure on the resident \n\nmicrobial community (Table I-3). There are a number of pronounced differences between microbial \n\ncommunities in DSS and surface waters (Konstantinidis et al. 2009). Microbial communities from the \n\ndeep sea maintain higher metabolic activity under pressurized conditions than under normal atmospheric \n\npressure, which indicates an adaptation to a piezophilic environment (Nagata et al. 2010). Furthermore, \n\nmetagenomic and biochemical analysis of the microbial community has unveiled a number of distinct \n\nfeatures. The occurrence of surface attachment and biofilm associated genes encoding for pilus, \n\npolysaccharide, and antibiotic synthesis suggest surface-attachment and biofilm organization as \n\nimportant lifestyles in bathypelagic microbial communities (DeLong et al. 2006). The absence of genes \n\nthat encode for proteins involved in light driven DNA repair (DeLong et al. 2006), a higher metabolic \n\ndiversity (Konstantinidis et al. 2009), cell membranes with a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids \n\nsuited to sustain cold and high pressure conditions (Wang et al. 2008), enzymes with weaker \n\nintermolecular interactions favouring molecular flexibility and catalytic efficiency, and larger genomes \n\n(1.35\u00b10.25 fold in comparison to bacteria from surface waters) with extensive intergenic regions and \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nTable I-3 - List of unique phenotypical features found in the DSS microbial community indicative of adaptation to this extreme \n\nmarine habitat. \n\nFeatures  \nReferences \n\nGenes associated to surface attachment and biofilm lifestyle (DeLong et al. 2006) \n\nAbsence of genes involved in light driven reactions (DeLong et al. 2006) \n\nHigher metabolic diversity (Konstantinidis et al. 2009) \n\nHigher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in cell wall (Wang et al. 2008) \n\nWeaker intramolecular enzymatic interactions (Nagata et al. 2010) \n\nLarge genomes (Konstantinidis et al. 2009) \n\n \n\nlarge numbers of rRNA genes (Konstantinidis et al. 2009; Nagata et al. 2010) are also characteristic \n\nfeatures of bacteria from DSS. \n\nAccumulation of PAHs in deep sea sediments \n\nDespite its remoteness, the deep sea has been an overlooked sink for PAHs (Bouloubassi et al. 2006; \n\nShao et al. 2010). In Table I-4 a list of studies measuring ?PAHs in DSS is available. Overall, \n\nconcentrations of ?PAHs in DSS are lower than those measured in other marine sediments, particularly \n\nwhen compared to salt marshes and estuaries (Yuan et al. 2014), although in coastal shelf sediments, \n\nrelatively low concentrations of ?PAHs have been measured (Wang et al. 2014). Nevertheless, it may \n\nprove incorrect to generalize information, since the quantity and quality of PAHs pollution in DSS \n\ndepends on the distance from land-based sources, anthropogenic pressure, natural seepage and \n\nhydrological circulation. The Mediterranean Sea has been relatively well-studied due to the relatively high \n\nanthropogenic impact and low water exchange (Bouloubassi et al. 2006; Mandalakis et al. 2014; Parinos \n\net al. 2013). Here, a 1-year sediment trap at 2850 m revealed a mean daily flux of 53 \u00b1 39 ng m-2 d-\n\n1(Bouloubassi et al. 2006) . HMW PAHs and LMW PAHs were dominating winter and summer sampling \n\nevents, respectively, indicating the main source of PAH varied with season and climate (Bouloubassi et \n\nal. 2006). An extensive survey in the Mediterranean measured ?PAHs from 11.6-223 ng g-1 (mean of \n\n63.9 ng g-1); the mean ?Phenanthrene/?HMWPAHs ratio was 0.45 \u00b1 0.19 indicating that pyrolytic \n\nsources were  dominant (Parinos et al. 2013). With the exception of a single dataset (Bouloubassi et al. \n\n2006), this seems to be the general consensus of all studies in the Mediterranean Sea (Bouloubassi et al. \n\n2012; Mandalakis et al. 2014; Tolosa et al. 1996). PAHs concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea are \n\nsimilar to those found in distant mid-Atlantic sub-surface sediments (455 ng g-1) (Shao et al. 2010), in at \n\nArctic Sea surface sediments (113-2504 ng g-1) (Yunker et al. 2011) and the Gulf of Mexico (Soliman and \n\nWade 2008).

Air-sea exchange may also be an important contributor when LMW are dominant, as \n\nexplained below. \n\nGeochemical processes such as hydrothermal activity and, especially, cold seeps, are an \n\nimportant source of PAHs in offshore sites such as the mid-Atlantic ridge (Cui et al. 2008; Konn et al. \n\n2009). Here, PAHs have been reported to accumulate in surrounding sediment (Burns et al. 2010; Etkin \n\n2009), despite natural communities degrading a significant fraction of the pollutant (Kappell et al. 2014). \n\nNatural seepage represents 47% of the oil introduced to marine environments (Kvenvolden and Cooper \n\n2003; National Academy of Science 2002). The estimated quantity of seep oil has been reported to be \n\nbetween 108-109 L annually) (Kvenvolden and Cooper 2003). However, estimations are based on \n\navailable data, mostly from continental margins and in oil producing regions, and omit the vastness of \n\nthe ocean realm including the deep sea. Therefore, overall marine seepage is probably higher. \n\nOf the remaining oil introduced in the marine environments, only 2.9% and 11.5% result from \n\nthe production and transportation of oil, respectively. Nonetheless, major oil spills represent a major \n\nthreat to marine ecosystems, especially near oil production areas and vessel corridors, because of the \n\nrapid release of high volumes of oil over a limited area and the frequency of spills near coastal regions. \n\nEven in areas with abundant natural seep sites (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico) the capacity of microbes to \n\nremove high amounts of oil has been questioned, due to limited dispersion and low oxygen \n\nconcentrations at some depths (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). During oil spills, physical weathering \n\ncompletely or partially removes the more volatile and polar hydrocarbons, namely small chain alkanes \n\n(&lt;C14) and LMW PAHs (Ke et al. 2002), while biodegradation removes long chain alkanes and some \n\nbranched alkanes (Reddy et al. 2002). Subsequently, a remnant fraction that includes HMW PAHs and \n\naPAHs, among others, persists (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2006; Teira et al. 2007; Yamada et al. 2003) and will tend \n\nto adhere to the sediment (Bouloubassi et al. 2006). In the recent Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, \n\nHMW PAHs represented 31% of ?PAH in the particulate phase while their relative abundance in oil \n\nwas only 8% (Boehm et al. 2011). Traces of PAHs, mainly HMW and aPAHs have been found in marshes \n\n30 years after oil spill incidents (Peacock et al. 2007; Reddy et al. 2002).  \n\nThe remaining hydrocarbons that enter marine environments are derived from land run-off and \n\natmospheric deposition. Here, rivers are important contributors of PAHs, particularly HMW PAHs with \n\nhigh Koc, to deep sea basins near river mouths. Rivers concentrate and transport these pollutants from \n\ntheir basin to the river mouth (Lipiatou et al. 1997; Scheringer et al. 2004). As an example, the sub basin \n\nof the Adriatic Sea (75 m) is enriched in PAHs derived from the agro-industrialized Po Valley \n\nhydrological system (Marini and Frapiccini 2013). When freshwater reaches the sea, the increase in \n\nsalinity causes mass transfer of PAHs to the particulate phase and subsequent sedimentation (Marini and \n\nFrapiccini 2013). Sedimentation is the main process by which PAHs enter marine sediments (Lipiatou \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\net al. 1997). The concentration of PAHs in marine sediments is positively correlated with the \n\nconcentration of particles &lt;15 \u00b5m (Charlesworth et al. 2002) and organic carbon (Mandalakis et al. \n\n2014). PAHs fluxes to the deep sea are influenced by size and degree of pollution of nearby rivers and \n\ncan be enhanced by natural meteorological events such as typhoons, hurricanes and floods (Lin et al. \n\n2013). PAHs are transported to the deep sea by lateral advection from the continental shelf, mainly \n\nthrough submarine canyons (Bouloubassi et al. 2012). Atmospheric deposition is an important \n\ncontributor of PAHs in oceans (Tsapakis et al. 2006). Atmospheric deposition consists of three \n\nprocesses: wet deposition and dry deposition that mainly transports PAHs with higher Koc, and air-sea \n\ngaseous exchange processes that mainly transport PAHs with higher vapour pressure (Tsapakis et al. \n\n2006). In contrast to what was initially assumed, air-water exchange is a significant source of PAHs into \n\noceans (mean 706 \u00b5g m-3 yr-1) and accounts for ? 76% of atmospheric deposition in the Eastern \n\nMediterranean Sea (?200 km) (Tsapakis et al. 2006). At sites further from pollution sources, air-sea \n\nexchange represented almost the totality of PAHs in atmospheric deposition (Ma et al. 2013). A 0.7% \n\nfraction (8 \u00b5g m-3 yr-1) of the total atmospheric deposition (929 \u00b5g m-3 yr-1) of PAHs reached sediment \n\ntraps located at 1440 m of depth and phenanthrene (associated to air-gas exchange) was the most \n\nabundant PAH (92 ng g-1) (Tsapakis et al. 2006). \n\nPAHs are known to bioaccumulate in macrofauna in rivers, estuaries and coastal marine habitats \n\n(Bandowe et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). In DSS, PAHs and other organic pollutants such as \n\norganochlorinated compounds (Froescheis et al. 2000) tend to bioaccumulate in deep sea organisms \n\n(Escart\u00edn and Porte 1999; Soliman and Wade 2008). At 480 m depth in the Mississippi Canyon, Gulf of \n\nMexico (before the DWH incident), PAHs were quantified in deep sea amphipods and results revealed \n\na mean bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of 4.37 \u00b1 2.55, with higher values for aPAHs in comparison to \n\nthe respective parent-PAHs (Soliman and Wade 2008). This was attributed to the high impact of oil \n\nexploration and natural oil seepage present in the area and reduced rates of degradation of aPAHs \n\n(Soliman and Wade 2008). BAFs were positively correlated with logKow (Soliman and Wade 2008); \n\nhowever, in another study using marine fish samples aPAHs were excluded from the analysis and BAF-\n\nlogkow correlation was parabolic with a peak estimated at a log Kow value of 5 (Li et al. 2014). Overall, \n\naPAHs and HMW PAHs have a higher tendency to bioaccumulate, but this relationship is not always \n\nlinear and may depend on the type of fauna sampled (Li et al. 2014). \n\nThe half-lives of PAHs increase in deep sea environments due to low temperature, high salinity \n\nand absence of light (Tansel et al. 2011). High salinity increases adsorption, due to the salting out effect, \n\nand consequently reduces bioavailability and increases persistence, particularly among HMW PAHs \n\n(Marini and Frapiccini 2013). Low temperature and absence of light favours PAHs persistence in deep \n\nsea environments due to lower metabolic activity of PAH-degrading organisms and, possibly, reduced \n\nsolubility and absence of photodegradation (Marini and Frapiccini 2013). \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nDegradation of PAHs under hydrostatic high pressure (HHP) and low temperature \n\n(LT). \n\nPAHs degradation in the deep sea is often assumed to be similar to surface waters. However, \n\nsimilarly to what was proposed for the ecotoxicological impact to marine macrobiota (Mestre et al. 2014), \n\nHHP and LT, may synergistically affect hydrocarbon degradation (Boesch and Rabalais 1987). HHP in \n\nDSS increases 10 MPa km-1 and temperature is 2-3\u00baC (Nagata et al. 2010). HHP is used to increase yield \n\nin biotechnological applications by enhancing oxygen rate in high-density bioreactors (Follonier et al. \n\n2012). Nonetheless it has also been shown to reduce poly-?-hydroxybutyric acid degradation by deep \n\nsea fungi (Gonda et al. 2000). Meanwhile, LT is known to universally reduce the kinetics of biochemical \n\nreactions, and thus, to reduce PAHs degradation under aerobic conditions (Brakstad and Bonaunet 2006; \n\nEriksson et al. 2003; Weissenfels et al. 1990) thereby leading to a build-up of dead-end metabolites \n\n(Eriksson et al. 2003). Synergistically, HHP and LT can affect PAH degradation reactions by 1) affecting \n\ncell physiology; 2) affecting catabolic enzymes and 3) affecting substrate bioavailability (Eisenmenger \n\nand Reyes-De-Corcuera 2009). \n\nHHP and LT affect biological activity in mesophilic bacteria by reducing membrane \n\nfunctionality (Barria et al. 2013), and by denaturing proteins leading to a reversible inactivation (Privalov \n\n1990). As an acclimation reaction, bacteria alter their membrane composition and synthesize protective \n\ncold-shock proteins (Barria et al. 2013). Monomeric proteins are generally well preserved by HHP, while \n\npressure can affect the supramolecular configuration and catalytic site of polymeric enzymes and, \n\nconsequently, reduce substrate affinity (Eisenmenger and Reyes-De-Corcuera 2009; Follonier et al. \n\n2012). In dioxygenases(Seo et al. 2009), HHP can induce the release of iron from Fe-S clusters (Malone \n\net al. 2006). PAHs degradation relies on Fe-S clusters to initially oxygenate PAHs. \n\nSolubility is an important aspect of PAHs degradation in DSS. In DSS, LT reduces PAHs \n\nsolubility differently (41.2% and 35% reduction for anthracene and pyrene, respectively, between 25\u00baC \n\nand 9\u00baC; (Bamford et al. 1999; Reza et al. 2002) and thus affects bioavailability. The overall effects on \n\nPAHs bioavailability may depend on the quality of the PAHs pool. The influence of an increase of HPP \n\non PAHs solubility at low or ambient temperature has, to our knowledge, not been reported. \n\nFew PAHs-degrading DSS strains have been tested under simultaneous HHP and LT \n\nconditions. Recently, the PAHs degrading strain Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1, isolated from a polluted \n\nstream (Gibson et al. 1973), was grown in naphthalene minimal medium at HHP ranging from 0.1-13 \n\nMPa and LT of 4\u00baC (Schedler et al. 2014). Results show a reduction in cell growth and naphthalene \n\ndegradation at 13.9 MPa in comparison to 0.1 MPa. Bacterial growth was also shown to slightly decrease \n\nuntil 8.8 MPa followed by a sharp reduction in growth until 12 MPa. The final naphthalene concentration \n\nwas below the detection limit from 0.1 to 12 MPa, but was 25.2% and 17.9%, respectively, at 12.5 and \n\n13 MPa (Schedler et al. 2014). HHP reduced growth and, above 12 MPa, reduced PAHs degradation \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n(Schedler et al. 2014). This represented the first evidence of a reduction in PAHs degradation under DSS \n\nconditions. Future work employing DSS isolates or the DSS microbial community, without \n\ndepressurization, is necessary to elucidate the fate of PAH in abyssal marine sediments. \n\nThe combined effect of LT and HHP can reduce PAHs biodegradation, since the reduction in \n\npermeability may hamper PAHs uptake; this is essential for the initial oxygenation reaction that occurs \n\nintracellularly, and the alteration of PAH-dioxygenase supramolecular conformation and/or catalytic site \n\nmay inactivate essential enzymes. It is plausible that PAH-degrading bacteria are adapted to these \n\nconditions. Microbial communities from deep sea maintain higher metabolic activity under pressurized \n\nconditions than under atmospheric pressure, which indicates adaptation to a piezophilic environment \n\n(Nagata et al. 2010). This may be similar to adaptations found in psychrotrophic environments (e.g. \n\nArctic), because similar taxa are found in both types of environment (McFarlin et al. 2014). It would be \n\ninteresting to assess these psychro-piezophilic adaptations in PAHs degradation and outline their \n\nbenefits for bioremediation or other biotechnological process applications. \n\nPAH-degrading marine bacteria \n\nPAH-degrading strains have been isolated from numerous marine environments including \n\nseawater, marine sediments, saltmarshes and estuaries. These isolates are phylogenetic distributed to \n\nphyla Proteobacteria (?, ? and ? classes), Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. \n\nSeveral genes encoding for PAH-degradation, that have been identified from different bacterial species \n\nshare high homology, thus suggesting that PAHs catabolic genes are transferred horizontally - [horizontal \n\ngene transfer (HGT)] - this is acquired through conjugal transfer of plasmids (Anokhina et al. 2004; \n\nCoelho et al. 2011; Jutkina et al. 2011). Genes encoding PAH-degrading enzymes are often located in \n\nIncP plasmids, that are prone to broad range HGT and insertion in DNA sequences (Dennis 2005). For \n\nexample, in a microcosm experiment, the nah gene detected in Shewanella oneidensis and Bacillus sp. was \n\nsimilar to that detected in Pseudomonads from the same sample (Ben Said et al. 2008). Similar results \n\nwere obtained in a microcosm seeded with sea surface samples (Coelho et al. 2011) and in saltmarsh \n\nrhizospheres (Oliveira et al. 2014a). PAH-degrading bacteria are generally found in low abundance in \n\nmicrobial communities from non-impacted marine environments (Yang et al. 2014). \n\nThe dynamics in the microbial community, following an acute PAH pollution event, is \n\ncharacterized by a rapid shift in composition, due to sudden dominance of the pioneer degrading strains \n\npresent (Vila et al. 2010). As PAHs are gradually degraded, other taxa, such as Roseobacter (Buchan and \n\nGonz\u00e1lez 2010), start to recover and feed on the PAHs intermediates as secondary consumers (Wang \n\nand Tam 2011). At the end of this process, the bacterial community has been reported to return to its \n\noriginal state (Kasai et al. 2001; Yang et al. 2014). \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nPAH-degrading isolates are frequently found within the ?- and ?-Proteobacteria classes, \n\nalthough this may be related to their ease of cultivability. The genera Cycloclasticus, Pseudomonas and some \n\ngenera of the Sphingomonadaceae family (Novosphingomonas, Sphingomonas and Sphingobium) are also frequent \n\namong marine PAH-degrading isolates (Dyksterhouse et al. 1995; Kasai et al. 2002). The genus \n\nCycloclasticus is widely distributed in marine environments and has been isolated from estuarine \n\nenvironments (Chung and King 2001; Dyksterhouse et al. 1995; Niepceron et al. 2010), sea sediments \n\n(Cui et al. 2014) and DSS (Wang et al. 2008). Cycloclasticus is considered an obligate marine PAH-degrader \n\nand the chlorinated derivatives thereof (Yakimov et al. 2007). It is frequently found during the mid-\n\nsuccession stages of oil degradation (Yakimov et al. 2007) and in cold environments (Coulon et al. 2007; \n\nLozada et al. 2008). The genera Novosphingomonas, Sphingomonas and Sphingobium (Sphingomonadaceae) are \n\nknown to use many organic compounds including PAHs (Huang et al. 2008; Kertesz and Kawasaki 2010; \n\nLeys et al. 2005). Sphingomonads have been isolated from various marine environments including DSS. \n\nThey are efficient PAH-degraders in oligotrophic environments because they possess a high-affinity \n\nuptake system (Johnsen et al. 2005). In Pseudomonas, PAHs degradation genes and biochemical pathways \n\nare extensively studied (Gomes et al. 2005; Suen and Gibson 1993). Pseudomonas spp. are ubiquitous and \n\nare described as competitive PAH-degrading bacteria in polluted terrestrial soils and sediments (C\u00e9bron \n\net al. 2008; Daane et al. 2001), in estuarine water (Coelho et al. 2011; Niepceron et al. 2010), sediments \n\n(Oliveira et al. 2014a) and in seawater (Uad et al. 2010). Although apparently ubiquitous, Pseudomonads \n\nwere absent in enriched consortia from DSS in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Cui et al. 2008; Wang \n\net al. 2008), but were found in DSS from the Arctic (Dong et al. 2014c). Pseudomonads are considered \n\nuseful for biotechnological applications due to extensive data available on their activity and metabolome, \n\nease of cultivation, stress resistance and presence of genetic mobile elements (Pucha?ka et al. 2008). \n\nPAH-degrading marine bacteria have been used in bioaugmentation approaches to mitigate \n\nenvironmental contamination, but the results have been disappointing so far (Kadali et al. 2012). \n\nComplete mineralization tends to be slow (Wang et al. 2008), or cannot be achieved by a single strain, \n\nbecause of the accumulation of toxic intermediates (Festa et al. 2013; Tixier et al. 2002). Under these \n\ncircumstances, mineralization is better achieved by consortia (Cui et al. 2014; Festa et al. 2013; Gallego \n\net al. 2013; HuiJie et al. 2011; Mao et al. 2012; Nzila 2013; Vallero 2010). Bioaugmentation with bacterial \n\nconsortia will have a synergistic effect because complementary PAHs degradation pathways promote \n\ncross-feeding and avoid the build-up of inhibiting metabolites (Bouchez et al. 1999). Also, the inclusion \n\nof secondary strains with, for example, high cell hydrophobicity and biosurfactant production in the \n\nconsortia will enhance the efficiency of the bioaugmentation process (Pedetta et al. 2013; Sorensen et al. \n\n2005) by increasing PAHs bioavailability (Pedetta et al. 2013) and providing essential growth factors and \n\nnutrients (Sorensen et al. 2005). \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nPAH-Degrading Bacteria in Deep Sea Sediments \n\nPAH-degrading isolates from deep sea environments known to date are listed in Table I-5. \n\nFifteen PAH-degrading strains from deep sea microbial communities were classified as novel species. \n\nIsolation efforts have focused on the 4 major ocean basins: Arctic, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific. Some \n\nreported isolates were not included in Table I-5 because they had low similarity with sequences from the \n\nNCBI database or were not classified by the authors. PAH-degrading isolates from the deep sea were \n\nmainly classified as ?- and ?-Proteobacteria, which are abundant classes in deep sea environments. \n\nRepresentatives of the ?-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Flavobacterium have also been found. \n\nOther abundant taxa found in DSS, such as Chloroflexi, ?- and ?-Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, \n\nhave no reported PAH- degrading isolates. Several marine PAH-degrading genera including \n\nCycloclasticus, Sphingomonas/Novosphingobium/Sphingobium, Halomonas, Alcanivorax, Thalassophira and \n\nMarinobacter have been found in DSS and are often similar to their coastal counterparts (Cui et al. 2008). \n\nOthers, such as Oceanicola, Parvibaculum, Nitratireductor (?-Proteobacteria) and Bowmanella (?-\n\nProteobacteria), were first reported as PAH-degraders in DSS. During the DWH oil spill, the first major \n\ndeep sea (?1500 m) oil pollution event, strains classified as Colwellia, Cycloclasticus and Pseudoalteromonas \n\ndominated in the oil-degrading community when the relative aromatic (mono- and PAHs) content was \n\nthe highest (Hazen et al. 2010). \n\nAn OTU assigned to the genus Cycloclasticus, from DSS of the Western Pacific Ocean (Wang et \n\nal. 2008) and Mid Atlantic Ocean Ridge (Cui et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2010), had 99-100% similarity with \n\na strain of Cycloclasticus spirillensus M4-6 (AY026915) isolated from the intertidal sediments of Lowes Cove, \n\nMaine (Chung and King 2001). In addition to Cycloclasticus, other OTU were similar to the following \n\nsequence in NCBI database: Flavobacterium frigoris (AJ601393) (92.6%), Novosphingobium pentaromativorans \n\n(AF502400) (98.8%), Halomonas alimentaria (AY553075) (96.9%), an uncultured proteobacterium \n\n(DQ230971) (98.2%) and Roseovarius tolerans (Y11551) (94.7%) (Wang et al. 2008b). In the Western \n\nPacific Ocean, a pyrene-degrading microbial consortium degraded 93.87% of pyrene in 7 weeks, with \n\n60% removal by week 2. Overall, a reasonable amount (46%) of the sequences obtained from DGGE \n\nhad low similarity (<97%) with sequences available at NCBI database (Wang et al. 2008).In the universe \n\nof the 21 genera represented, the proteobacteria phylum (?- (53.8%) ?- (38.6%) and ?- classes (3.8%)) \n\n(Wang et al. 2008) was dominant. \n\nPAH-degrading microbial consortia from two subsurface sediment samples from the mid-Atlantic ridge \n\nrevealed a dominance of ?- and ?-Proteobacteria using DGGE (Cui 2008; Shao 2010).In addition to the \n\nmain band, associated with Cycloclasticus spirillensus M4-6, other DGGE bands had high similarity with \n\nAlcanivorax venusti ISO4 (98-100%), Marinobacter alkaliphus (100%), M. viniformis FB1 (99%), \n\nMarinobacterium georgiense (100%) and Tistrella mobilis (99%) (Cui et al. 2008). At a different location in the \n\nmid-Atlantic ridge OTU were assigned to the taxa Cycloclasticus sp.

Genes pheA1a (UniProt accession n\u00ba G4WYQ4) and pheA1b (UniProt accession n\u00ba \n\nG4WYQ4), that encode for the ?- and ?- subunits of phenanthrene dioxygenase, respectively, were \n\ndetected in the transposon tnp1 (JF710635.1) in strain TVG9-VII isolated from a deep sea hydrothermal \n\nvent (Dong et al. 2011). This strain was closely related to the isolate Novosphingobium indicum H25, also \n\nfrom the deep sea (Jun et al. 2008). BLAST similarity search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) \n\nindicated a 99% similarity between partial sequences (query coverage - 63%) of these two genes (pheA1a \n\nand pheA1b) and those detected in the large plasmid pNL-1, which is commonly detected in \n\nsphingomonads, inclusively in N. aromaticivorans DSM 12444 [NCBI accession n\u00ba CP000676, isolated \n\nfrom subsurface sediments from Atlantic coastal plains (Balkwill 1989)]. The pNL-1 plasmid is \n\ntransferred among many strains belonging to the Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas genera (Basta et al. 2005). \n\nHowever, this similarity may be limited to the nah gene, and not to the mobile genetic element itself, \n\nsince the transposases of TVG9-II have no similarity with those of N. aromativorans. The aminoacid \n\nsequence of both genes (pheA1a and pheA1b) have a 99% sequence similarity to aromatic degrading \n\nenzymes from strains DSM 12444, N. indicum H25 and Sphingobium sp. C100, all isolated from deep sea \n\nwaters from the Indian or Arctic Ocean, and with Sphingobium strains PNB and LH128 isolated from \n\nwastewater treatment plant (Roy et al. 2013b) and contaminated soil (Schuler et al. 2009). \n\nA total of 6 strains from the deep sea environment have a draft or complete genome publicly \n\navailable (Table I-5): Sphingobium sp. C100, Marinomonas profundimaris D104, Alcanivorax pacificus W11-5, \n\nThalassopira profundimaris WPO11, Cycloclasticus sp. P1 and Oceanibaculum indicum P24. Using this public \n\ninformation we performed a BLAST (http://www.uniprot.org/blast/) analysis of the putative catabolic \n\nenzymes\u2019 aminoacid sequences involved in initial steps of PAHs degradation [as determined by gene \n\nannotation in bacterial.ensemble.org] (Curwen et al. 2004; Kersey et al. 2012; Potter et al. 2004). Results \n\nrevealed a high similarity with sequences from UNIPROT database. Enzymes of strains Sphingobium \n\nC100 and M. profundimaris D104 had 100% similarity with enzymes from Sphingobium strains PNB and \n\nLH128 (Roy et al. 2013b), and from Alteromonas sp. SN2 (Math et al. 2012), respectively. Strain SN2 was \n\nisolated from petroleum contaminated tidal flats and its genes involved in PAHs degradation are located \n\nat genomic island GI-11 flanked by two transposases, indicative of a past HGT event (Math et al. 2012). \n\nFor Cycloclasticus sp. P1, the aminoacid sequences of estradiol dioxygenase, ?- and ?- subunit dioxygenase, \n\ncatechol dioxygenase and ferredoxin reductase, all had high similarity (between 99 to 100%) with \n\nsequences from C. zancles 7-ME, isolated from marine sediment at the site of the MT Hazen oil tanker \n\nshipwreck (78 m depth), and with sequences from Cycloclasticus sp. PY97M, isolated from Yellow Sea \n\nsediments [17.8 m depth; (Cui et al. 2014)]. Additionally, gene clusters encoding ?- and ?- subunits of \n\ndioxygenase and ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase in the isolate Cycloclasticus P1 were previously reported \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nto have 98.8% and 99.8% similarity with equivalent genes in Cycloclasticus sp. A5, isolated from seawater \n\n(15m) (Kasai et al. 2002). In T. profundimaris WPO11, the aminoacid sequences of protein involved in \n\nPAH-degradation by gene annotation had 74-82% similarity with sequences from T. xiamensis M-5. M-5 \n\nwas isolated from oil wastewater and both were initially reported to be similar on the basis of morphology \n\nand 16S rRNA gene similarity (98.5%) (Wang et al. 2008). \n\nIn A. pacificus W11-5 and O. indicum P24, the aminoacid sequences of proteins involved in PAH-\n\ndegradation had low similarity (<51% and&lt;58%, respectively) to database sequences. Deep sea bacteria \n\nthus contain PAH degrading genes that are similar to and markedly different from genes encountered in \n\nshallow water bacterial communities. Enzymes unique to the deep sea bacterial community can be availed \n\nfor biotechnological applications and promoting DSS as a relevant habitat for bioprospection effort. \n\nPathways of PAH degradation in marine environments. \n\nThe fate of PAHs, after entering the marine environment, is determined by various processes, \n\nincluding sedimentation, volatilization, sinking, resuspension, photo- and biodegradation. Bacterial \n\nbiodegradation strongly depends on chemical properties such as molecular size (number of aromatic \n\nrings) and molecule angularity (Kanaly and Harayama 2000). Generally, an increase in size and angularity \n\nleads to an increase of toxicity (Table I-1; (Banerjee et al. 1995; Kanaly and Harayama 2000), chemical \n\nreactivity and a reduction in aqueous solubility and volatility (Kanaly and Harayama 2000; Seo et al. \n\n2009). In soil, the estimated half-lives of 3-ring phenanthrene and 5-ring benzo[a]pyrene range from 16 \n\nto 126 days and 229 to 1400 days, respectively (Peng et al. 2008b; Shuttleworth and Cerniglia 1995). In \n\nsitu biodegradation of PAHs in nature also depend on environmental factors, such as nutrient and \n\nsubstrate bioavailability, oxygen availability, electron acceptors and temperature (Quan et al. 2009). PAHs \n\nbiodegradation involves metabolic reactions catalysed by a variety of enzymes. \n\nGenerally, the initial step of PAHs catabolism is crucial and, although varying among substrates \n\nand microorganisms (Seo et al. 2009), in aerobic conditions always involves the introduction of one or \n\ntwo oxygen molecules in the ring structure of the PAHs with formation of a metabolite with one or two \n\n-OH radicals, in a reaction known as oxygenation, catalyzed by di- or monooxygenases (Kanaly and \n\nHarayama 2000; Seo et al. 2009). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in PAHs biodegradation and is \n\ncarried out by the ?- subunit of the aromatic ring dioxygenases (ARD) with a non-heme iron catalytic \n\ndomain (Deman\u00e8che et al. 2004). Iron and oxygen availability are thus vital in aerobic PAHs catabolism. \n\nThe diversity of genes encoding ARD among PAH-degrading bacteria from soil has been clustered into \n\ntwo groups associated with gram-negative and gram positive bacteria (C\u00e9bron et al. 2008). ARD of gram-\n\nnegative bacteria is further clustered into various subtypes, three of which are well-defined: phnAC, \n\nphnA1 and nahAC, related to Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2, genus Cycloclasticus and genus \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nPseudomonas/Sphingomonas, respectively (Lozada et al. 2008). In DSS, ARD sequences related to \n\nphnAC/phnA1 and nahAc subtypes are encountered in draft genomes of previously mentioned isolates. \n\nSubstrate specificity of ARD varies widely among PAHs (Peng et al. 2008b). Microbial \n\ncommunities potentially harbour a wide array of organisms with distinct ARD and that can shift quickly \n\nin response to PAH inputs (Kimura and Kamagata 2009; Selvakumaran et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2008). \n\nAfter the oxygenation step, the dihydrodiol intermediate ring structure is cleaved by intradiol- or estradiol \n\noxygenases in between the hydroxyl groups (meta-cleavage) or before the hydroxyl groups (ortho-\n\ncleavage) yielding protocatechuate and catechol intermediates that can be further converted to \n\ntricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2004; Nzila 2013; Seo et al. 2009). Frequently, PAHs \n\nfrom three to n benzenic rings form sequentially, intermediate dihydriol with n-1 aromatic rings until \n\nreaching 1,2-naphthalene dihydrodiol from which the pathway proceeds as described in naphthalene \n\nbiodegradation (Nzila 2013). In PAHs degradation, the intermediate metabolic products and enzymes \n\nare similar to other metabolic pathways and are widespread among bacteria (de Lorenzo 2008). \n\nThere is little information on the metabolomics of PAH-degrading isolates in DSS. In \n\nCycloclasticus sp. P1, some metabolites from pyrene biodegradation identified by GC-MS (Wang et al. \n\n2008) were distinct from those previously reported (Kweon et al. 2011; Moscoso et al. 2012; Seo et al. \n\n2009). A pathway involving an initial dioxygenation of the pyrene molecule to form a pyrene-4,5-\n\ndihydrodiol, which was further metabolized to cyclopenta(def)phenanthrone (main metabolite) was \n\nproposed. This was followed by cyclopenta(def)phenanthrone metabolization to a lactone and \n\nsubsequently to a 4-phenantrenol (secondary metabolite). The subsequent pyrene biodegradation \n\npathway would follow the most usual phenanthrene degradation pathway via 3,4-dioxygenation (Seo et \n\nal. 2009). Although many intermediates lack analytical confirmation, DSS may harbour unknown \n\nmetabolic pathways since the main metabolite (cyclopenta(def)phenanthrone) has not yet been detected \n\nin pyrene degradation pathways in the available literature. \n\nFuture perspectives: PAHs biodegradation in DSS within a global change context. \n\nFuture climate scenarios have proposed an increase in partial CO2 pressure (pCO2), which will \n\nlead to a reduction in oceanic pH (Rhein et al. 2013). Mean pH values for ocean waters have already \n\ndecreased from 8.21 to 8.10 from pre-industrial times until present and will be further reduced by 0.3-\n\n0.4 units by 2100 (Caldeira and Wickett 2003; Doney et al. 2009). Under this scenario, some biological \n\nprocesses in the marine environment are predicted to increase, namely the production of extracellular \n\npolymeric substances (EPS), nitrogen fixation and enzyme activity (Liu et al. 2010), while calcification in \n\nthe majority of calcifying organisms will be adversely affected (Doney et al. 2009). Iron bioavailability \n\nwill also be reduced, particularly in distant offshore waters, by increasing the adsorption by organic \n\nparticles, (Shi et al. 2010). UV radiation (UVR) is currently higher than in pre-industrial times, but \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nbecause of the recovery of the ozone layer is expected to regress and stabilize to levels of the 1980s (and \n\npossibly to 1960s levels) in high an mid latitudes and an increase in 3% in the tropics by the end of the \n\n21st century, but also be adversely affected by an increase in greenhouse gases and pollution (Bais et al. \n\n2011). \n\nTo our knowledge, the impact of future climate scenarios on the biodegradation of PAHs in \n\nDSS has not been addressed in the scientific literature. Climate change is thought to synergistically \n\nexacerbate overall marine pollution, by adversely affecting the biodegradation of oil and other pollutants \n\n(Coelho et al. 2013). However, few studies have experimentally measured this impact and interlinked the \n\ncompilation of direct and indirect impacts that result from the rise in greenhouse gases. The integration \n\nof the predicted effects of the interplay of climate change and pollution on the structure and activity of \n\nmicrobes in the water column and in marine sediments may provide the basis for a theoretical model on \n\nthe fate of PAHs in DSS in future climate scenarios. \n\nIn the deep sea, the direct impacts of global warming are expected to be mild. Although future \n\nscenarios for the deep sea environment are not consensual, the rise in temperature is expected to occur \n\nat a reduced rate (0.03\u00baC per decade) when compared to the ocean surface (Rhein et al. 2013). However, \n\nat a regional scale, abrupt temperature shifts can occur (Danovaro et al. 2004). Also, the concentration \n\nof the carbonate ion and salinity are expected to decrease at a depth range of 1000 \u2013 4000 m and >4000 \n\nm, respectively (Rhein et al. 2013), while pH is predicted to slightly increase (Rhein et al. 2013). However, \n\nthe impact of climate change effect on surface waters will affect marine primary production (PP), which \n\nwill impact deep sea ecosystems due to shifts in chemical energy derived from the sedimentation of \n\ndetritus (McClain et al. 2012). Increased pCO2 is expected to directly increase marine primary production \n\n(PP) (Riebesell et al. 2007). However, increased pCO2 rise will also increase surface water temperatures \n\nleading to stratification that will adversely affect PP and increase the relative abundance of pico- and \n\nnanoplankton (Smith et al. 2008). Any alteration in PP will affect heterotrophic activity, organic carbon \n\ncontent and bacterial respiration (Joint et al. 2011) and bacterial community structure (Endo et al. 2013) \n\nin the overall ocean. Additionally, an increase in atmospheric pCO2 will increase terrestrial PP and \n\nincrease organic carbon fluxes to DSS, particularly via the major rivers. An increase in particulate matter \n\nmay increase PAHs adhesion and thus reduce its bioavailability due to strong adhesion of PAHs to \n\nparticles, particularly HMW PAHs (Nam et al. 1998). Also, a more prolonged and defined thermal \n\nstratification, as a result of an increase in surface water temperature, and a reduction in upwelling may \n\nreduce total PP (Chavez et al. 2011). Ocean stratification and the overall warming of seawater will also \n\nreduce oxygen by 6 to 12 ?mol kg\u20131 by the year 2100 (Fr\u00f6licher et al. 2009), mainly at 200 \u2013 400 m depth \n\nand at mid-latitude, expanding the marine hypoxic and suboxic zones (Rhein et al. 2013; Stramma et al. \n\n2010). Because oxygen is an important element in the initial steps of PAHs biodegradation, PAHs \n\ndegradation may be limited by oxygen in some marine areas and depths under future climate scenarios. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nLong term studies on the impact of a pCO2 increase on bacterial processes of degradation and \n\nmineralization of organic matter are, however, lacking (Witt et al. 2011). \n\nA mesocosm study provided evidence that the interactive effect of reduced pH and oil \n\ncontamination can adversely affect the structure and functioning of sediment benthic communities in \n\nmarine coastal ecosystems(Coelho et al. 2015). This study also showed that reduced seawater pH caused \n\na significant change in the structure of the active bacterial communities, with a marked reduction in the \n\nrelative abundance of the anaerobic oil-degrading and sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales. This effect \n\nwas, however, negated in the reduced seawater pH and UV-B treatment (Coelho et al. 2015). The \n\npresence of UVR can thus potentially alleviate the impact of ocean acidification on oil-degrading \n\norganisms. This may be because photooxidation converts oil compounds, including PAHs, into more \n\nwater soluble metabolites that are more reactive and toxic (Mallakin et al. 2000) (namely epoxides and \n\nquinones (Petersen and Dahll\u00f6f 2007)) but are also more bioavailable (Yu 2002). This is particularly the \n\ncase for recalcitrant HMW PAHs (Guieysse et al. 2004; Lehto et al. 2000). PAHs bioavailability is the \n\nmost limiting factor in PAHs removal in polluted environments (Pedetta et al. 2013), thus UVR can \n\naccelerate the overall PAHs detoxification (Zhang et al. 2008). We speculate that when oil pollution \n\noriginates from natural seepage and leakage or blowout of oil extraction at aphotic depths, the absence \n\nof photooxidation will lower its degradation rate under reduced pH conditions. \n\nIn addition to UVR, PAHs bioavailability, solubility and volatility will increase because of an \n\nincrease in water and atmospheric temperature and therefore, the amount of HMW PAHs that reach \n\nDSS may be reduced. Additionally, changes in PAHs toxicity in the deep sea environment may occur as \n\na result of interactions between high hydrostatic pressure and the physiological adaptations of DSS \n\norganisms (Mestre et al. 2014). If, as observed in shallow sediments, the synergy between acidification \n\nand pollution leads to a change in the structure of the active bacterial community, the interaction between \n\nchanging pCO2, UVR and temperature may have site or region specific effects on the amount, \n\ncomposition and rate of biodegradation of the PAHs pool in DSS. \n\nConclusions \n\nInputs of PAHs in marine environments are likely to increase and this represents a long-term \n\nenvironmental risk. During descent, recalcitrant compounds are little affected by biodegradation in \n\ncomparison to the more labile organic carbon. Thus, the DSS can be considered a \"sink\" for PAHs in \n\nthe marine environment. The source and quality of the PAHs pool encountered at DSS may vary \n\nbetween locations. DSS nearer to land have higher relative abundance of HMW PAHs derived from wet \n\nand dry deposition and from land run-off, while land-distant DSS have higher relative abundance of \n\nLMW PAHs and aPAHs that derive from gas-water exchange and underwater oil seeps. Theoretical \n\nmodels of PAHs biodegradation in DSS neglect the importance of the abiotic conditions, namely HPP \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nand LT. More realistic data on biodegradation rates of PAHs in DSS are needed to understand the \n\nultimate fate of PAHs there. Here, we assume that, although these abiotic conditions complicate PAHs \n\ndegradation, bacterial adaptation may counter this. Overall, many novel isolates have been obtained in \n\nthe DSS and are mainly related to phylum Proteobacteria, particularly the ?- and ?- classes. PAH-\n\ndegrading isolates in DSS harbour genes and enzymes involved in initial steps of PAHs degradation, \n\nhave low and high similarity to those present in the NCBI database, while others have high similarity \n\nwith known genes encoded in mobile genetic elements. Thus, the DSS gene pool simultaneously \n\nharbours genes indicative of past HGT of mobile genetic elements and genes that are unreported and \n\npotentially novel. \n\nIt is still difficult to predict the role of DSS on hydrocarbon biodegradation under future climate \n\nscenarios, and field and laboratory results are urgently needed. However, from the integration of field \n\nevidence with experimental results obtained from the water column and in shallow sediments, local or \n\nregion-specific effects may be expected. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nA.

Among the oil hydrocarbons emitted are include, in small \n\namounts of other hydrocarbons, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Yet, in contrary to \n\nthe other hydrocarbons, the bacterial players involve in PAH turnover has never been accessed. \n\nFurthermore, these bacteria may possess interesting adaptations to the extreme abiotic conditions and \n\nthus have potential biotechnological adaptations. In this study we isolated and identified PAH-degrading \n\nbacteria from sediment samples obtained from apparently active and inactive craters of the Mikhail \n\nIvanov mud volcano and a reference site (abyssal plain). Minimal medium containing phenanthrene and \n\nchrysene as primary sources of carbon were used to enrich and isolate PAH-degrading bacteria. Our \n\nresults revealed that the isolates from all enrichment cultures were mostly composed by members of the \n\nfamily Bacillaceae (Bacillus and Virgibacillus genera) and, in most of the cases, capable of producing \n\nbiosurfactants. Additionally, in the inactive crater and in the reference site, isolates from Acinetobacter and \n\nRhodococcus genera, respectively, were obtained. Our results indicated that Bacillus-like bacteria may \n\ncontribute for the metabolic turnover of seeped PAHs in the deep sea Mikhail Ivanov mud volcano and \n\nin surrounding environments. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, Cold seeps, Virgibacillus, Bacillus, Biosurfactant, Bathyal \n\nzone \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nAn extensive occurrence of mud volcanoes (MV) has been reported, at depths between 200 m \n\nand 5000 m, in vicinities of strike-slip fault lines at the frontier of the Eurasian and African tectonic \n\nplates in the southwest Iberian margin of the gulf of Cadiz (Hensen et al. 2015; Le\u00f3n et al. 2012; Pinheiro \n\net al. 2003). MV where first reported at the accretionary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz, but during the \n\nSWIMGLO/Transflux M86/5 cruise, three new MV [Abzu, Tiamat and Mikhail Ivanov (M. Ivanov)] \n\nwere discovered at the outer margins of the accretionary wedge, in the Horseshoe valley (Hensen 2014). \n\nMV are piercement structures created by compression forces (e.g. tectonic force) that propel upward, \n\nthrough a soft sediment layer (e.g. accretionary wedges or deltas), a pressurized fluid mostly composed \n\nof water and hydrocarbons, thus creating mud seepage (Dupr\u00e9 et al. 2014; Mazzini et al. 2009). This \n\npressurized hydrocarbon flux will feed a diverse heterotrophic benthic microbial community that will \n\ntransfer the assimilated carbon and energy up to the higher trophic levels, thus supporting an oasitic \n\nbiological hotspot in the, usually barren, deep sea surface (Coelho et al. 2016b; Gibson et al. 2005). This \n\nmicrobial community has been frequently analyzed through mass-sequencing approaches (Coelho et al. \n\n2016b; Pachiadaki et al. 2011); however, this information, although valuable, provides limited \n\ninformation regarding the functional role of the microorganisms present. These metabolism-microbe \n\nassociations can be instead better established through culture-dependent analyses. \n\nUnderwater seepage system are spread throughout the marine sediments and the documented \n\nsites alone are estimated to represent 47% of all oil hydrocarbons emitted into the marine realm \n\n(Kvenvolden and Cooper 2003). The gaseous hydrocarbons methane, ethane, propane and butane are \n\nprogressively the most predominant oil hydrocarbons expelled at MV. Yet, other hydrocarbons such as \n\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected at sediments of MVs and other seepage \n\nphenomena (Geptner et al. 2006; Lorenson et al. 2002; Polonik et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2011) and in the \n\ntissues of sessile organisms in various cold seeps systems (Powell et al. 1999; Serafim et al. 2008; Wade \n\net al. 1989). Curiously, in contrast to the gaseous hydrocarbons, the microbial communities involved in \n\nthe degradation of PAH in MV have been largely overlooked. To our knowledge, only a few studies have \n\nreported PAH degrading isolates from hydrocarbon seepage system, all from hydrothermal vents (Dong \n\net al. 2011; Dong et al. 2010). These bacteria may have interesting biotechnological applications given \n\ntheir capability to efficiently degrade xenobiotics under extreme environment conditions (Deming 1998) \n\n[e.g. low temperatures, high hydrostatic pressure and potentially high sulphide and methane \n\nconcentrations (Van Gaever et al. 2006)]. \n\nPAHs comprise hydrocarbons with two or more merged benzene rings (Wang et al. 2003). They \n\nare environmentally problematic pollutants, because their partial degradation produces toxic \n\nintermediates that increase macrofauna mortality (Gardiner et al. 2013; \u00d6zhan et al. 2014) and can alter \n\nthe bacterial community core composition, potentially disturbing key biogeochemical cycles (Lindgren \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\net al. 2014; Pietroski et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2014). In marine environments, PAH-biodegradation is \n\ninitially achieved through the action of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (Yakimov et al. 2007). These initially \n\nlatent, but will respond quickly to exogenous oil input and bloom (Yakimov et al. 2007). However, due \n\nto unique abiotic conditions present in deep sea MV, the PAH-degrading microbial communities may \n\nbe distinct from those typically found in contaminated coastal areas. Bacteria from ?- and ?-\n\nProteobacterial classes, most notably the Cycloclasticus genus, are typically found in contaminated coastal \n\nareas and that they are important players in the process of sediment decontamination here (Louvado et \n\nal. 2015). In addition, these bacteria are usually able to produce extracellularly biosurfactants, amphiphilic \n\nmolecules that will increase oil in water micellization and, consequently, enhance oils bioavailability, thus \n\ncontributing to speed up the process of oil degradation (Ron and Rosenberg 2001).  \n\nCuriously, despite of all the knowledge on PAH degradation in coastal areas there is a shortage \n\nof information on the composition of PAH degrading communities in MV areas and their ability to \n\nproduce biosurfactants. In this study we aimed at isolating and identifying PAH-degrading bacteria from \n\nsediment samples obtained from M. Ivanov mud volcano area (active and apparently inactive craters) \n\nand in a reference site (located in the surrounding abyssal plain of the Horseshoe valley) and their ability \n\nto produce biosurfactants was also evaluated. \n\nMethods \n\nMedium and chemicals \n\nEnrichment culture (EC) medium was adapted from M9 medium (Notomista et al. 2011) \n\ncontaining NaH2PO4 (7 gL-1), K2HPO4 (3 gL-1), NH4Cl (1 gL-1), peptone (0.1 gL-1), yeast extract (0.1 gL-\n\n1), MgSO4 (0.1365 gL-1), FeNH4 citrate (0.0214 gL-1), CaCl2 (5 mgL-1), ZnSO4.7H2O (3.5 mgL-1), \n\nMnSO4.H2O (2.8 mgL-1), Co(NO4)2.6H2O (0.7mgL-1), CuSO4 (0.625mgL-1), H3BO3 (0.15mgL-1), \n\nNa2MoO4.2H2O (60 \u00b5gL-1) and NiCl2.6H2O (20 \u00b5gL-1). M9 solid medium was prepared by adding 1.2% \n\nagarose (Fischer scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). After autoclave sterilization, filter sterilized \n\ncycloheximide solution at a final concentration of 0.1 g L-1 was added. Cooled enrichment culture \n\nmedium was spiked with phenanthrene (98%) and chrysene (99%) at final concentrations of 100 and 5 \n\nmg L-1, respectively, from 200 x concentrated acetone-dissolved stock solutions (20 g L-1 and 1 g L-1 for \n\nphenanthrene and chrysene, respectively). For solid medium, cycloheximide, phenanthrene and chrysene \n\nwere added to molten solid M9 medium at ?50\u00baC, and immediately poured into petri dishes. After the \n\naddition of the PAHs, the acetone was left to evaporate in a laminar-flow chamber for approximately 10 \n\nminutes. Phenanthrene, chrysene and cycloheximide were all supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, \n\nUSA). \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nSampling \n\nThe M. Ivanov mud volcano is one of the three new MV discovered ?90 km west of the limit \n\nof the accretionary wedge of the gulf of Cadiz during the SWIMGLO/Transflux M86/5 cruise (Hensen \n\n2014; Hensen et al. 2015). Sediment samples used in the enrichment cultures were obtained from two \n\ndistinct craters in the M. Ivanov mud volcano (Figure II-1): the NW crater, which was apparently inactive \n\nbecause no chemotrophic fauna was visually detected (M.R. Cunha, personal observation) - \"inactive \n\nmud volcano\" (IMV) - (35\u00ba44\"41'N 10\u00ba12\"18'W) and the SE crater, which was apparently active because \n\nthe presence of mud breccia, gas hydrates and chemotrophic fauna was confirmed by box core sampling \n\n(M.R. Cunha, personal observation) - \"active mud volcano\" (AMV) - (35\u00ba44\"34' N 10\u00ba12\"06'W) on \n\n05/03/2012; and from a reference site (RS - 35\u00ba42\"00'N 09\u00ba57\"93'W) distant from any known MV on \n\n27/02/2012 (Hensen 2014). Cores were obtained using a box-corer for the MV samples and a TV guided \n\nmultiple cores for RS samples. Final sample was composed of four 0.5-1 g of sub-samples, from the top \n\nsediment layer (0-1 cm b.s.f.) of each core, that were pooled, homogenized with 1 mL glycerol and \n\nimmediately deep-frozen and stored at -80\u00baC, first on board and later in laboratory, until further use. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II-1 - Map of Gulf of Cadiz. Sampling site (M. Ivanov MV) is located southwest of the Iberian Peninsula \n\non the SWIM 1 fault line.

Ten mg of sediment inoculum was seeded in \n\n100 mL Erlenmeyer containing 50 mL of EC and incubated at room temperature for 8 weeks. Culture \n\nmedium was renewed at the second and fourth weeks. For the renewal, 0.5 mL of previous EC was \n\ninoculated into 50 mL of fresh EC medium containing the same concentration of PAH and \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\ncycloheximide. Cultures were maintained in the dark and without agitation, to mimic deep sea conditions. \n\nFor bacterial isolation, 1 mL aliquots were taken in triplicate (at day 3 and weekly, afterwards), serially \n\ndiluted and spread-plated on solid M9 medium with added PAHs (Sanders 2012). Plates were incubated \n\nat 25\u00baC and, after visible growth (3-7 days), distinctive colonies were obtained and streaked on agar EC \n\nmedium to obtain pure cultures using streak plate procedure by the quadrant method (Sanders 2012). \n\nGenotyping and 16S RNA gene sequencing of isolates \n\nFor DNA extraction, isolates were inoculated in LB medium (Merck, USA) spiked with PAHs \n\nand grown overnight. Cells were collected from the liquid cultures and DNA was extracted through the \n\nphenol-chloroform method [adapted for bacteria (Ghosh et al. 2013)]. To exclude clones, the DNA from \n\neach isolate was PCR-amplified using BOXA1R primer (5\u2019-CTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGACG-3\u2019) \n\n(Versalovic et al. 1991). Extracted DNA (1 \u00b5L) was used as template in a 25 \u00b5L reaction containing 12.5 \n\n\u00b5L of Master mix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 2.5 \u00b5L of DMSO and 2 \u00b5L of primer solution \n\n(Rademaker et al. 2000). Amplification was performed with initial denaturation at 94\u00baC during 5 min, \n\nfollowed by 40 cycles of 94\u00baC/1 min; 53\u00baC/1 min; 72\u00baC/8 min and ended with an final extension at 72\u00bac \n\nduring 15 min. Electrophoresis was performed in agarose gel 1% with GelredTM (Biotium, Fremont, \n\nCA, USA), at 80 V during approximately 160 min in TAE buffer 1 x [from a 50 x stock solution (Fisher \n\nScientific, Hampton, NH, USA); final concentration was 40 mM Tris-acetate and 1 mM EDTA], with 2 \n\n\u00b5L of DNA size marker (GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder, ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, \n\nUSA) that was added in the outer sockets of the agarose gel. Gels were digitalized, and bands were \n\naligned, using the DNA size marker as reference, and analyzed in BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, \n\nSint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). Dendrograms were constructed by applying presence/absence Jaccard \n\nindex with minimum correlation of 5%. The 16S rRNA gene of representative isolates was PCR-\n\namplified using primers 27F (5\u2019-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG -3\u2019) and 1492R (5\u2019-\n\nCTACGGRTACCTTGTTACGAC-3\u2019) and 1 \u00b5L of DNA template in a 25 \u00b5L reaction containing 12.5 \n\n\u00b5L of Master mix (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 0.5 \u00b5L of bovine serum albumin and \n\n0.25 \u00b5L of each primer solution. Resulting amplicon was sequenced externally at GATC-Biotech \n\n(Konstanz, Germany). The obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared with those available on \n\nthe NCBI database using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi - Accessed 17-04-2017).  \n\nPhylogenetic tree was constructed using the selected 16S rRNA sequences of bacterial isolates \n\nobtained in this study and some of their closest relatives in GenBank [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/] \n\n(Tamura et al. 2013). All sequences were aligned using ClustalW and a phylogenetic analysis was \n\nconducted using MEGA 6 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/; version 6.06). A phylogenetic tree \n\nwas constructed using the neighbour-joining method and evolutionary distances were computed using \n\nthe maximum composite likelihood with discrete Gamma distribution. In the results, a bootstrap \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nconsensus tree based on 1000 replicates is presented. The bootstrap value is shown next to each branch \n\nwhen it exceeds 50% and represents the percentage of replicates in which the associated taxa clustered \n\ntogether. \n\nTest for biosurfactant production \n\nBiosurfactant production was tested by the atomized oil assay (Burch et al. 2010) as described \n\nin Domingues et al 2012 (Domingues et al. 2012). Escherichia coli DH5? was used as negative control and \n\nsolutions of commercial surfactants were used as positive controls: 0.008 mM Tween 80 (Merck, \n\nDarmstadt, Germany), 10 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), 1 mM cetyl \n\ntrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,USA) and 15.4 nM surfactin \n\n(Sigma- Aldrich, USA, St. Louis, MO,USA). The negative control and the isolates were inoculated using \n\na sterile toothpick on LB agar medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and grown overnight at 25\u00baC, \n\nwhile for positive controls 10 \u00b5L of solution were added to agar and air-dried. Afterwards, an airbrush \n\n(model BD-128P, Fengda, United Kingdom) was used to nebulise the liquid paraffin (Merck, Darmstadt, \n\nGermany) over the colonized solid medium. The presence of biosurfactants was detected by the presence \n\nof a halo surrounding the colony visible under indirect light. \n\nResults and discussion \n\nA total of 39 bacterial strains were isolated from all enrichment cultures and, through BOXA1R \n\ngenotyping analysis, these were reduced to 14 representative isolates. The partial 16S sequencing results \n\nof these isolates was compared with sequences available on the NCBI database and their closest \n\nphylogenetic relatives are listed in Table II-1. The phylogenetic relations between isolates and some of \n\ntheir closest relatives is presented in Figure II-2 and phylogenetic classification by RDP classifier \n\n(https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/classifier) is listed in Table II-2. The majority of the isolates (nine) were \n\nretrieved from the enrichment cultures using IMV samples and all except um were affiliated with the \n\nfamily Bacillaceae. Only one isolate was retrieved from the AMV enrichment culture and its closest \n\nrepresentative was B. baekryungensis T10-3M (Na et al. 2011). Unfortunately, geochemical data that could \n\ndetermine the degree of seepage activity at each crater were not available and their classification as active \n\nor inactive was based solely on the visual presence or absence of gas hydrates and meiofauna (M.R. \n\nCunha, personal observation). However, previous mass-sequencing data revealed a significant higher \n\nabundance of the methane-oxidizing order Methylococcales (Redmond et al. 2010) in the AMV \n\nsediments, comparatively to sediment from the IMV and the RS (Coelho et al. 2016b), therefore \n\nsupporting this visually-based classification. From the RS samples 4 strains belonging to Bacillus spp. (2 \n\nisolates), Virgibacillus spp. and Rhodococcus spp, were isolated. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nTable II-1 - Similarity results using BLAST on NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi - Accessed 17-04-2017) and biosurfactant production of all representative isolates with \n\nvalid DNA sequences.

The 16S rRNA amplicon \n\nsequence from these isolates were highly similar (>99%) with those retrieved from both terrestrial (Baig \n\net al. 2012; Yu et al. 2014) and marine environments (Yoon et al. 2003) (Table II-1). Some of these \n\nsequences were related with heavy metal tolerance (Yu et al. 2014) and halophilic environments (Li and \n\nYu 2012; Na et al. 2011; Sahay et al. 2012).

All isolates had high similarity (>99%) with sequences in the database. \n\nTable II-2 - Identification and characterization of all representative isolates with valid DNA sequences \n\nRepresentative \nisolate \n\nRDP Classification \n\nFamily Genus \n\nCE34a Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPD13rab Bacillaceae 100% Virgibacillus 100% \n\nCE14a Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nCD21ab Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPE11db Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nCD31d Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPE14b Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPE23rab Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPE14a Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nPE11dc Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nCA14aa Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nCE21a Bacillaceae 100% Bacillus 100% \n\nD18a Corynebacterineae 100% Rhodococcus 100% \n\nCE11a Moraxellaceae 100% Acinetobacter 100% \n \n\nPreviously reported mass-sequencing data of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the bacterial \n\ncommunity in the IMV, AMV and RS samples (and in other MV discovered) has a low percentage of \n\nFirmicutes (Coelho et al. 2016b). Firmicutes, Bacilli and Bacillaceae were not among the most abundant \n\nphyla, classes and orders in any of the MV samples and reference site (Coelho et al. 2016b). This is \n\ncoherent with other marine mud volcano sediments (Pachiadaki et al. 2011) and with other deep sea \n\nsediments, which are normally dominated by the Proteobacteria phylum (Li et al. 1999). However, high \n\nthroughput 16S rRNA gene analyses are speculated to under-represent endospore-forming bacteria from \n\nFirmicutes, possibly because of the difficulties in disrupting the hardy outer cortex of the endospores by \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nmany traditional DNA extraction methods (Filippidou et al. 2015). Also the abundance of PAH-\n\ndegrading bacteria may be niche-specific, since PAHs, although detected (Geptner et al. 2006; Lorenson \n\net al. 2002; Polonik et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2011), are extremely less concentrated in MV sediments in \n\ncomparison to the C1-C4 gaseous hydrocarbons (Lein et al. 1999; Niemann et al. 2006). However among \n\nthe culturable fraction, bacteria from the phyla Firmicutes are recurrently isolated from deep sea \n\nenvironments (da Silva et al. 2013; Lu et al. 2001), inclusively in situ (G\u00e4rtner et al. 2011).  \n\nPAH-degrading bacteria affiliated with the Bacillaceae family have rarely been isolated from deep \n\nsea sediments (Louvado et al. 2015) and the same applies to other gram-positive bacterial groups \n\n[exception include a two actinobacterial strains (Peng et al. 2008a; Wang et al. 2008)]. In both terrestrial \n\nand marine environments, gram positive PAH-degrading bacteria are more commonly found among the \n\nhigh G+C Actinobacteria phylum (Vila et al. 2015) and known encoding genes of the PAH-dioxygenase \n\nenzyme in gram positive bacteria seem limited to actinobacterial strains from terrestrial environments \n\n(C\u00e9bron et al. 2008; Ding et al. 2010; Iwai et al. 2011). Although infrequent, some exceptions have been \n\nreported in marine environments, as members of the Bacillaceae family have been previously isolated from \n\nPAHs enrichment cultures using various mesophilic marine sediments as inoculum (Daane et al. 2002; \n\nLin and Cai 2008; Marcos et al. 2009; Zhuang et al. 2003). For example, in a culture independent analysis \n\nof anaerobic sediment, the Firmicutes phylum (mainly represented by the Peptostrepococceae family of \n\nthe Clostridiales order) was a predominant bacterial group in the oil amended microcosm (Sherry et al. \n\n2013). However, PAH-degrading isolates obtained from deep-sea sediments are normally affiliated to \n\ntaxa from the Proteobacteria phylum (Cui et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2008), possibly because \n\nefforts to isolate PAH-degrading bacteria here have been mostly focused on the abyssal plains (Louvado \n\net al. 2015).  \n\nBacillus-like isolates with PAH-degrading capacity may possibly be more frequently detected in \n\nenvironments with potentially extreme abiotic conditions. In terrestrial environments, Bacillus-like \n\nbacteria have been repeatedly reported as a key xenobiotic degrader under thermophilic and alkaliphilic \n\nconditions (Annweiler et al. 2000; Margesin and Schinner 2001). Coherently, in marine extreme \n\nenvironments, the Bacillus genus comprised the majority of the cultivable heterotrophic bacterial \n\ncommunity at a deep sea brine lake [a geological phenomenon frequently associated with mud volcanism \n\n(Dupr\u00e9 et al. 2014)] (Sass et al. 2008) and at an alkaline serpentinizing fluid seepage site (Meyer-Dombard \n\net al. 2014). The Bacillaceae family was relevant in the culture-independent analysis of deep sea cold seep-\n\nassociated pockmark (Cambon-Bonavita et al. 2009). Furthermore, the Bacillaceae family was detected as \n\nthe predominant taxa in overall bacterial community of an anaerobic EC, with petroleum as it sole carbon \n\nsource, using the same IMV samples from this study, and a relevant family in similar anaerobic EC using \n\nAMV. sediments (Domingues et al. 2016). Gram-positive bacteria, potentially because of its stronger \n\nouter peptidoglycan cell wall, thrive in extreme and highly variable abiotic conditions (Zhuang et al. \n\n2003). Yet, from the RS samples Bacillus spp. isolates were also retrieved, revealing that Bacillus-like  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II-2 - Phylogenetic relations of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of bacterial isolates obtained in this study and \n\nsome of their closest relatives in GenBank [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/] (Tamura et al. 2013). All \n\nsequences were aligned using ClustalW and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA 6 \n\nsoftware (http://www.megasoftware.net/; version 6.06). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using \n\nthe neighbor-joining method and evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum \n\ncomposite likelihood with discrete Gamma distribution and a bootstrap consensus tree based on \n\n1000 replicates is presented. The bootstrap value is shown next to each branch when it exceed 50% \n\nand represents the percentage of replicates in which the associated taxa clustered together. \n\n \n\nbacteria are important PAH-degraders in these stable deep sea abyssal plains or that the RS was \n\ninfluenced by potential and undiscovered natural oil seepage sites in its surroundings \n\nBiosurfactant production by hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial communities is a strategic \n\nadaptation to cope with the low aqueous solubility and consequent bioavailability of oil hydrocarbons. \n\nIn this study, biosurfactant production (Figure II-3) was detected by the atomized oil assay in 5 \n\nrepresentative isolates: 4 were affiliated to the Bacillus genus and one to the Acinetobacter genus (Table \n\nII-2). Both genera are known to comprise biosurfactant-producing strains (Ceresa et al. 2016; Dong et \n\nal. 2016; Patowary et al. 2015). Biosurfactant-producing Bacillus spp usually produce lipo-cyclicpeptides \n\n(e.g. surfactin) (Ceresa et al. 2016), while Acinetobacter spp. produce glycolipid biosurfactants (Dong et al. \n\n KJ733979.1 Bacillus sp.

These results demonstrate a versatile metabolism of xenobiotic \n\npollutants and highlight the biotechnological potential of these isolates. \n\nOur study showed that Bacillus-like species may potentially be involved in PAH biodegradation \n\nin deep sea environments. However, although the analysis of the culturable fraction of a particular \n\nbacterial community may establish direct functional roles inside the consortium, it may only represent a \n\nminor fraction of the microorganism\u2019s present. Many bacteria may have been excluded in both the \n\nenrichment culture and in the isolation procedures because of several factors such as inappropriate \n\nculture medium composition, incapacity to grow on solid medium, not ideal in vitro abiotic conditions \n\nand strong interdependencies between organisms (Zhang et al. 2017). \n\nConclusions \n\nIsolates attributed to the Bacillaceae family dominated the culturable fraction of the \n\nPAH-degrading bacterial community from the enrichment cultures established using deep sea MV \n\nsediments. This dominance was unexpected since, to the best of our knowledge, PAH-degrading gram-\n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\npositive bacteria are rarely isolated from the deep sea environment. The potential biotechnological \n\napplication in the biodegradation of xenobiotics is promising. \n\nAcknowledgements and Funding \n\nThe M86/5 cruise was funded by the German Research Foundation (TransFlux grant) with \n\nadditional support by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) with the \n\nSWIMGLO project (FCT PTDC/MAR/100522/2008), and FLOWS (EU-COST, ES 1301).

However, the \n\nbiogeochemical characteristics of subsurface sediments may act as a potential buffer to environmental \n\nchanges. In this study, we used a microcosm experimental approach to access the independent and \n\ninteractive effects of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination on the composition of subsurface \n\nbenthic bacterial communities, at two time points, by 16S rRNA gene based high-throughput sequencing. \n\nAn in-depth taxa-specific variance analysis revealed that the independent effects of reduced seawater pH \n\nand oil contamination were significant predictors of changes in the relative abundance of some specific \n\nbacterial groups (e.g. Bacillales, Clostridiales, Rhizobiales and Desulfobulbaceae). However, overall the \n\nresults indicate that the independent and interactive effects of reduced pH and oil contamination had no \n\nsignificant impact on the subsurface bacterial communities. This study provides evidence that, despite \n\nprevious indications, bacterial communities inhabiting subsurface sediment may be less susceptible to \n\nthe effects of oil contamination in a scenario of reduced seawater pH. \n\nKeywords: Oil spill, Sulfate-reducing bacteria, Desulfobulbaceae, Ocean acidification, Climate change, \n\nSubsurface sediments \n\nIntroduction \n\nCarbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) in the atmosphere has increased from 280 to 404 ppm \n\nbetween the preindustrial era and October 2016 (Dlugokencky and Tans 2016; Indermuhle et al. 1999). \n\nThis rise was caused by fossil fuel consumption and its rate has no parallel with past events (IPCC 2013). \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nThe oceans have attenuated this rise by absorbing 30% of the CO2 emitted, but at a cost (Canadell et al. \n\n2007). In seawater, an increase in pCO2 alters the balance of inorganic carbon species and, consequently, \n\nreduces seawater pH in a process known as ocean acidification (OA) (Doney et al. 2009). It is estimated \n\nthat, in average, pH levels in ocean surface water will drop between 0.3 to 0.4 units (Hartin 2016; IPCC \n\n2013), depending on models, and by the end of this century, and up to 0.7 units by 2300 (Hartin 2016). \n\nThe total impact of OA on marine microbial communities is difficult to predict, mainly due to \n\nthe multiple environmental and biological factors involved. An increase in pCO2 is certain to have a \n\nnegative impact on all calcifying biota (Doney et al. 2009) and has the potential to augment \n\nphotosynthesis, thus indirectly increasing nitrogen fixation and additional CO2 absorption (Riebesell et \n\nal. 2007). OA may alter the speciation, solubility, organic complexation and, consequently, the \n\nbioavailability of essential and/or toxic trace metals (Hoffmann et al. 2012). This may affect lithotrophic \n\nmetabolism (Kirk et al. 2016) and, subsequently, anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation (Zeng et al. \n\n2015), which relies on nitrate, sulfate, iron(II) or CO2, among others, as electron acceptors (Wentzel et \n\nal. 2007; Widdel and Musat 2010). An increase in seawater pCO2 may differently affect these electron \n\nacceptors, increasing (e.g. CO2) or decreasing [i.e. NO42-, SO42- and Fe(II)] their bioavailability, and, thus, \n\npotentially altering the predominant metabolism in the microbial community (Kirk et al. 2016; Millero \n\n2009). OA may also reduce burrowing, and expand the suboxic and anoxic zones of sediments (Laverock \n\net al. 2013), where hydrocarbon biodegradation is substantially less efficient (Widdel and Musat 2010), \n\nbut essential (McGenity 2014). Here, the lack of disturbance and the high adhesion forces of the \n\npredominant clay/mud sediments physically entrap and occlude buried hydrocarbons from initial \n\noxygenation and photolysis (Louvado et al. 2015; McGenity 2014), promoting their persistence (Peterson \n\net al. 2003). \n\nA previous study showed that the interaction between reduced seawater pH and oil \n\ncontamination significantly altered the active microbial community at the uppermost sediment layer (? \n\n0-1cm b.s.f.) (Coelho et al. 2016a; Coelho et al. 2015). The interaction between these two factors \n\nsignificantly reduced the relative abundance of anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading sulfate reducing \n\nbacteria (Order Desulfobacterales and Desulforomonadales) (Coelho et al. 2015). This reduction was \n\nlater found to be coupled with a reduction in specific archaeal groups and an increase in putative \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic fungal OTUs (Coelho et al. 2016a). However, the implications of the potential \n\neffects of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination on microbial communities inhabiting subsurface-\n\nsediment anaerobic layers remains unknown. We suspect that the impact of OA on microbial \n\ncommunities and their functions will be attenuated in sediments (Braeckman et al. 2014), particularly at \n\nthe subsurface sediments (Dashfield et al. 2008; Widdicombe et al. 2009), by the buffering capacity of \n\nsediments constituents (Ben-Yaakov 1973; Pertusatti and Prado 2007). \n\nHere, we used a 16S rRNA gene based high-throughput sequencing approach to study the \n\nindependent and interactive effect of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination on the structure of \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nsubsurface sediment bacterial communities under controlled microcosm conditions. Taking into account \n\nthe potential buffer effect of subsurface sediments against environmental changes, we hypothesized that \n\nbacterial communities colonizing this habitat will be less susceptible to the effects of oil contamination \n\nin a climate change scenario of reduced seawater pH. \n\nMethods \n\nMicrocosm experiment \n\nThis study is based on a microcosm experiment that was previously reported (Coelho et al. \n\n2015). The microcosm platform, named experimental life support system (ELSS) is a flow-through \n\nsystem and has been previously validated to study the effects of climate change scenarios on benthic \n\nmarine communities (Coelho et al. 2013). It was originally used to investigate the independent and \n\ninteractive effects of ocean acidification, ultraviolet radiation and oil contamination in estuarine and \n\ncoastal marine benthic communities [bacteria, an epibenthic gastropod (Peringia ulvae) and a benthic \n\npolychaete (Hediste diversicolor)]. The ELSS maintains individual microcosms at a controlled temperature, \n\nby submersion in water bath, while allowing the simulation of a diurnal light and tidal cycle, and the \n\nmanipulation of pH. Full details regarding microcosm architecture and validation can be found in Coelho \n\net al. (2013). \n\nIn this study, we specifically focused on bacteria, the subsurface sediment layer (? 5 cm b.f.s.) \n\nand the independent and interactive effect of the factors: oil hydrocarbon contamination and seawater \n\npH. Each factor had two levels: normal and reduced pH; with and without oil. In total, four treatments \n\nwere tested: a) 'Cont' (normal seawater pH without oil contamination); b) 'OnpH' (reduced seawater pH \n\nwithout oil contamination); c) 'OnOi' (normal seawater pH with oil contamination); d) 'pHOi' (reduced \n\nseawater pH with oil contamination). Each treatment was replicated in four independent microcosms \n\nrandomly arranged. Seawater pH was reduced by bubbling CO2 and automatically stabilized by a V2 \n\nPressure Regulator Pro coupled to V2 Control pH Controller (TMC Iberia, Lisbon, Portugal) (Gattuso \n\nand Lavigne 2009). The average synthetic seawater pH was 7.62 \u00b1 0.11 in microcosms supplied with \n\nacidified seawater and 7.94 \u00b1 0.10 in the control microcosms. This difference falls within the 0.3\u20130.4 pH \n\ndecrease modelled for global sea surface for the year 2100 (Caldeira and Wickett 2003). The simulation \n\nof an oil spill was done by pouring crude oil (0.5% v/v) into randomly selected treatments during five \n\nconsecutive high tides. Detailed information regarding the experiment can be found in Supplementary \n\nFiles. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nSampling and DNA Extraction \n\nComposite sediment samples were collected, at the end of the high tide, seven (time point 7 - \n\nT7) and twenty-one (time point 21 - T21) days after the simulated oil spill. Four mini-cores (\u00f8 1 cm) per \n\nmicrocosm were retrieved from the sediment and a ?1 cm layer at approximately 5 cm b.s.f. was sliced, \n\ncollected and pooled. Samples were stored immediately at -80\u00baC. DNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A \n\nSoil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) following manufacturer recommendations. \n\nIllumina MiSeq sequencing \n\nThe 16S rRNA gene V4 region was PCR amplified using primers 515 (5\u00b4-\n\nGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3\u00b4) and 806 (5\u00b4-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u00b4) with barcode \n\non the forward primer in a 30 cycle PCR using the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA) \n\nunder the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 28 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 53\u00b0C \n\nfor 40 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute, after which a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C was performed during \n\n5 minutes. After amplification, PCR products were checked in 2% agarose gel. Pooled samples were \n\npurified using calibrated Ampure XP beads. Library preparation and sequencing were performed \n\nexternally (MR. DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA) on a MiSeq sequencing platform following standard \n\nIllumina protocols.  \n\nData analysis \n\nSequencing analysis was performed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology \n\n(QIIME) software package (http://qiime.org; Accessed 01 January 2014) according to published \n\nrecommendations and following previously described methods (Cleary et al. 2015; Kuczynski et al. 2011) \n\nwith the exception of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking step, where the UPARSE (Edgar \n\n2013) clustering method and chimera check was used. The most recent Greengenes database \n\n(ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/gg_13_8_otus.tar.gz) was used for \n\ntaxonomic assignment. Detailed information regarding the data analysis is available in Supplementary \n\nInformation. Sequences are available at NCBI sequence read Archive (study accession n\u00ba \n\nPRJNA391281). \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nThe OTU tables were uploaded to R software (version 3.1.1; http://www.r-project.org/) for \n\nremoval of unassigned and singleton OTUs, chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences, statistical \n\ncomputing and graphic generation. A self-written function (Gomes et al. 2010) was used to estimate total \n\nrarefied OTU richness for each treatment and timepoint. Variation in composition among treatments \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nwas assessed using principal coordinates analysis (PCO). The PCO was generated using the cmdscale() \n\nfunction in the R base package in vegan (Oksanen et al. 2012). Prior to the PCO, the raw data was \n\nlog(x+1) transformed and used to produce a distance matrix with the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() \n\nfunction in vegan. Also in vegan, the adonis() function for permutational multivariate analysis of variance \n\n(PERMANOVA) was used to test for significant variations in composition among factors (Oksanen et \n\nal. 2012). In the adonis analysis, the Bray\u2013Curtis distance matrix of OTU composition was the response \n\nvariable with factors oil and pH (oil*pH) as the independent variables. The number of permutations was \n\nset at 999. To test variation in OTU composition between time points a repeated measure permutational \n\nanalysis of variance was performed with the adonis() function in the vegan package (Oksanen et al. 2012). \n\nWe also preformed, for all relevant taxa (phylum to family with a mean relative abundance ?0.1 %) at \n\neach time point, a taxon-specific analysis, in which the significance of their compositional variation, \n\nbetween treatments, was accessed through an ANOVA. A linear regression distribution was created \n\nusing the glm() function in the stats package with the OTU matrix as the response variable and oil, pH \n\nand the interaction between these two factors (oil*pH) as independent variables. We limited our analysis \n\nby establishing a threshold (mean relative abundance ?0.1 %) to all levels. The relative abundance was \n\ncalculated for each time point as a percentage of the total number of sequences in each sample using the \n\nprop.table() function in base package and the mean relative abundance was obtain through the arithmetic \n\nmean of these percentiles for each bacterial group in samples and treatments. Next, a two-way ANOVA \n\ntest was applied to the models, using the anova() function in the stats package in R with the F test \n\n[adapted from (Roy et al. 2013a)]. The most significant (p-value ? 0.05) taxa were plotted using the \n\nboxplot() function from the graphics package. \n\nResults and discussion \n\nOverall bacterial community analysis \n\nThe sequencing effort generated ?1.9x106 sequences that, after quality screening, were clustered \n\nin 26 237 OTUs. Rarefied richness (Figure S III-1) had no asymptote for in any sample, which indicates \n\nthat the true richness is higher than reported here. These OTUs were assigned to 67 phyla (95.88% of \n\nall OTUs), 163 classes (89.80%), 233 orders (67.89%) and 281 families (38.78%). Overall, the bacterial \n\ncommunity of the anaerobic sediment fraction was dominated by Proteobacteria (mean relative \n\nabundance 53.49 \u00b1 4.29%), followed by Chloroflexi (10.62 \u00b1 4.54%), Bacteriodetes (8.94 \u00b1 2.57%), \n\nActinobacteria (6.82 \u00b1 2.61%), Planctomycetes (3.97 \u00b1 0.99%), Acidobacteria (3.79 \u00b1 0.38%), \n\nGemmatimonadetes (1.53 \u00b1 0.19%), candidate division WS3 (1.12 \u00b1 .0.26%), Cladithrix (1.03 \u00b1 0.24%) \n\nand Spirochaetes (1.03 \u00b1 0.41%). The occurrence of Proteobacteria in the subsurface sediment layer was \n\nlower than in the superficial sediment (RNA-based study) (Coelho et al. 2015). In the superficial \n\nsediment, there was a considerable increase in the relative abundance of this phylum in the end of the \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nmicrocosm system validation (95.74%) when compared with the sampling site (74.03%) (Coelho et al. \n\n2013). In the subsurface layer, however, the relative abundance of this phylum was relatively stable \n\nthroughout the experiment (T7 - 53.69 \u00b1 3.86%; T21 - 53.28 \u00b1 4.81 %). However, representativeness \n\nof the Proteobacteria phylum is similar with previous studies at the Ria de Aveiro water system (Coelho \n\net al. 2013; Gomes et al. 2013; Oliveira et al. 2014b). In our dataset, the Proteobacteria phylum was \n\nmainly represented by classes ?- (24.03 \u00b1 4.35%)and ?-(22.70 \u00b1 4.86%) proteobacteria. The \n\npredominance of deltaproteobacterial OTU is mainly attributed to the sulfate-reducing bacterial OTU \n\nfrom the Desulfobacterales order (15.13 \u00b1 3.95%) which normally dominates the bacterial community \n\nin anoxic barren wetland environments (Gomes et al. 2013). \n\nTable III-1 Output results from the Adonis statistical test for factors independently and in interaction.  \n\n Timepoint 7 Timepoint 21 \n\n F1,15 R2 p-value F1,15 R2 p-value \n\npH 0.302 0.021 0.793 0.625 0.046 0.549 \n\nOil  1.383 0.098 0.225 0.768 0.056 0.486 \n\npH and Oil  0.375 0.027 0.726 0.316 0.023 0.799 \n \n\nThe PCO analysis (Figure III-1) revealed no clear separation among treatments, thus suggesting \n\nthat the independent and interactive effect of seawater pH and oil contamination had no major effect \n\non the overall structure of the subsurface bacterial communities. This was further confirmed by the \n\nadonis statistical test (Table III-1). The repeated measures adonis analysis showed that time was not a \n\nsignificant predictor of overall bacterial OTU composition (repeated measures adonis, F1,31=0.472, \n\nR2=0.016, P=0.543), indicating that bacterial community structure was stable throughout the \n\nexperiment. The biogeochemical characteristics of subsurface sediments may have attenuated the effects \n\nof the tested factors. However, despite the lack of major changes in the subsurface communities, a group \n\nspecific analysis for each time point revealed that four phyla, seven classes, twelve orders and ten families \n\nresponded (ANOVA p-value &lt;0.05) to the independent and/or interactive effects of reduced seawater \n\npH and oil contamination. These taxa are plotted for T7 in Figure III-2 and for T21 in Figure III-3. \n\nIndependent effects of oil hydrocarbon contamination \n\nOverall, the independent effect of oil contamination did not significantly alter the subsurface bacterial \n\ncommunity composition at any of the time points (Table III-1). Despite this, the group-specific analysis \n\ndetected significant variation (ANOVA p-value &lt;0.05) in the relative abundance of some bacterial \n\ngroups by oil at T7 (Figure III-2) and T21 (Figure III-3). Some taxa previously associated with oil \n\nhydrocarbon degradation increased in relative abundance in response to oil amendment. For example, \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-1 - Principal components analysis (PCO) of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) 7 days (A) and \n\n21 days (B) after oil contamination.

Prior to the PCO, the raw data was log10(x+1)-\n\ntransformed and used to produce a distance matrix based on the Bray-Curtis distance with the \n\nvegdist() function in vegan (Oksanen 2012).

In the ANOVA, each factor \n\nindependently and the interaction had 1 degree of freedom \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\norder Sphingomonadales includes well known aerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (Kim and Kwon \n\n2010). However, order Sphingomonadales represent at most an average of 0.16 \u00b1 0.05% of the bacterial \n\ncommunity. The lack of oxygen in the subsurface sediment layer probably limited its proliferation. On \n\nthe contrary, putative anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria belonging to the Clostridiaceae, \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae families (and their respective orders) were more abundant and had \n\na significant response to oil contamination at T21 (Figure III-3). Order Clostridiales are frequently \n\ndetected in anoxic oil contaminated matrixes, including wetland sediments (Sherry et al. 2013) and \n\nanaerobic oxidation has been found to be coupled with nitrate (van der Zaan et al. 2012), thiosulfate \n\n(Sherry et al. 2013) and iron (Lentini et al. 2012) reduction. The relative abundance of Clostridiales was \n\npreviously found to increase with depth in oil contaminated microcosm sediments (Sanni et al. 2015). \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae families include known oil degrading bacteria and have been \n\nfrequently detected in anoxic oil-contaminated matrixes (Fahrenfeld et al. 2014; Jin et al. 2013; Oren and \n\nXu 2014; Pan et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2009). Representative sequences from our most abundant \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae OTUs were compared with sequences available on NCBI database and had \n\n99%sequence similarity to the 16S sequences of bacterial strains retrieved from anoxic, hydrocarbon- \n\nand sulfate-rich (2mM) port sediments (OTU 12 and 17377) . \n\nThe number of groups affected by oil and their representativeness increased substantially at T21 \n\n(Figure III-3). This late response is probably explained by a delayed migration of oil hydrocarbons \n\nthrough the sediments. However, since hydrocarbon concentration was not measured at sampling depth, \n\nthis can only be speculated. In estuarine environments, the fine-grained sediments form a compact \n\nsediment barrier that substantially slows oil migration (Cheong and Okada 2001). Furthermore, in our \n\nmicrocosms, the sediment cores were always submerged and pore saturation may have further impeded \n\noil permeation (Oliveira and Nicolodi 2017). The sediment barrier may have also reduced the quantity \n\nof hydrocarbons that reached the subsurface sediments, attenuating its overall impact. For example, in a \n\nsimilar oil spill microcosm simulation, oil hydrocarbons were percolated from the surface layer to the \n\nsubjacent layer, but, their concentrations at the subadjacent layer were considerably lower (?10-fold) \n\nthan those measured initially at the surface layer (Nakazawa et al. 2016). This attenuation in \n\nconcentrations of oil hydrocarbons may be explained by an efficient biodegradation in overlying \n\nsediments (Nakazawa et al. 2016). \n\nIndependent effects of reduced seawater pH \n\nAcidified seawater did not change the overall bacterial community composition (Figure III-1 \n\nand Table III-1). The absence of geochemical data at sampling depth limits our interpretation of this \n\nresults. Sediment pH profiles are complex and naturally variable, and their response to high-CO2 systems \n\nwill be greatly influenced by sediments physico-chemical properties (Queir\u00f3s et al. 2015).The dissolution \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-3 - Boxplot with the relative abundances of OTU classified to bacterial groups (phylum, class, order and \n\nfamily) interaction at time point 21.

In \n\nthe ANOVA, each factor independently and the interaction had 1 degree of freedom \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nof carbonate salts (Ben-Yaakov 1973; Morse et al. 2006), the absorption of [H+] ions by humic acids \n\n(Pertusatti and Prado 2007) and the high levels of pCO2 and [H+] derived from organic matter \n\nmineralization (Soetaert et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2006) all contribute to the sediment buffer capacity, which \n\nmay have stabilized porewater pH during their transit. Previous studies have indicated that porewater \n\npH decreases in the most superficial sediments (2-3 mm)but this acidification is progressively attenuated \n\nin deeper sediments (Dashfield et al. 2008; Widdicombe et al. 2009). \n\nDespite this, at both time points the group specific analysis of sub-surface sediment \n\ncommunities revealed that some bacterial groups responded to the reduction in seawater pH (Figure \n\nIII-2, Table S III-1 and Table S III-2). This compositional stability of the overall bacterial community \n\nand the some significant group-specific variations are consistent with previous studies (Kerfahi et al. \n\n2014; Queir\u00f3s et al. 2015; Raulf et al. 2015; Roy et al. 2013a; Tait et al. 2013). Among the bacterial groups \n\nthat had a significant response to reduced seawater pH is included class Bacilli, which had a significant \n\nhigher relative abundance in the reduced seawater pH treatments at both T7 (Figure III-2 - Cont: 0.19\u00b1 \n\n0.08%; OnpH: 0.35 \u00b1 0.25%; pHOi: 0.6 \u00b1 0.44%; OnOi: 0.18 \u00b1 0.07%) and T21 (Figure III-3- Cont: \n\n0.12 \u00b1 0.04%; OnpH: 0.31 \u00b1 0.23%; OnOi: 0.18 \u00b1 0.06%; pHOi: 0.27 \u00b1 0.09%). Although statistically \n\nsignificant, the relative abundance of class Bacilli had a high variation among replicates in reduced pH \n\ntreatments. Nonetheless, this trend is consistent with other studies, as bacteria associated to the phylum \n\nFirmicutes tend to increase in abundance in reduced pH conditions (Chauhan et al. 2015; Meron et al. \n\n2011; Morrow et al. 2015). For example, the relative abundance of the order Bacillales, in the bacterial \n\ncommunity associated to the coral Acropora eurystoma, increased when pH was artificially reduced from \n\n8.2 to 7.3 (Meron et al. 2011). Also, at an underwater CO2 vent (low pH marine environment), order \n\nBacillales relative abundance was the highest when pH was the lowest and it decreased along the pH \n\ngradient created by the vent (from pH 6.7 to 8.0) (Chauhan et al. 2015) \n\nAcidified seawater also caused a significant decrease (F1,16=6.991; P=0.018) of the relative \n\nabundance of the Family Desulfobulbaceae, but only at T7 (OnpH: 4.1\u00b10.67; pHOi: 4.37\u00b11.24; Cont: 5.21 \n\n\u00b1 0.84; OnOi: 6.58 \u00b1 1.95). These results are coherent with results obtained in the top layer (Coelho et \n\nal. 2015) and a negative correlation between reduced seawater conditions and these taxa may be possible. \n\nDesulfobulbaceae are obligate sulfate reducing bacteria (Kuever et al. 2015) frequently involved in \n\nsyntrophic oxidation of methane along with the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (Green-Saxena et al. \n\n2014). In this syntrophy, bacteria from the Desulfobulbaceae family characteristically use nitrate as \n\npreferential nutrient source (Green-Saxena et al. 2014). Reduced seawater pH may decrease nitrate \n\nconcentrations, since it is known to decrease ammonia oxidation (Beman et al. 2011), thus possibly \n\nexplaining the significant lower abundance of family Desulfobulbaceae in acidified seawater treatments. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nInteractive effects of reduced seawater pH and oil pollution \n\nThe interactive effects of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination were characterized by a \n\nsignificant reduction in the relative abundance of five taxa at T7 (Figure III-2, Table S III-3 and Table S \n\nIII-4) at T7. Responsive groups include some notably abundant taxa [e.g. phylum Bacteroidetes (average \n\nrelative abundance: 8.69 \u00b1 2.42%) and Gemmatimonadetes (1.57 \u00b1 0.18%)]. Bacteroidetes are \n\nheterotrophic bacteria characteristically involved in degradation of recalcitrant polymeric organic matter \n\n(Fernandez-Gomez et al. 2013), particularly polysaccharides. The catabolism of polysaccharides may be \n\nindirectly stimulated in CO2-acidified seawater by an increased activity of their catabolic enzymes \n\n(Piontek et al. 2010). Thus, reduced pH conditions and an increase in carbon inputs could explain the \n\nhigher relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes in pHOi (8.89 \u00b1 3.21%) when compared to OnpH \n\n(7.19 \u00b1 2.06%) and OnOi (7.87 \u00b1 1.52%). The Gemmatimonadetes phylum is divided into five non-\n\ncurated groups in the SILVA database (Hanada and Sekiguchi 2014) and in our results only the first \n\ngroup (Gemm-1) had a significant response to the interactive effect of reduced seawater pH and oil \n\ncontamination (Figure III-2). Gemmatimonadetes are speculated to be characteristically involved in \n\nphosphate removal through polyphosphate intracellular accumulation (Zhang et al. 2003). Nonetheless, \n\nGemmatimonadetes have been detected in hydrocarbon contaminated coastal sediments, including \n\nmangrove sediments (Gomes et al. 2008; Rosano-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2012), which may explain their slight \n\nincrease in OnOi (1.61 \u00b1 0.23%) in comparison to Cont (1.49 \u00b1 0.17%). The reason for their relative \n\nincrease in OnpH (1.72 \u00b1 0.13%) at T7 and the decrease in pHOi (1.47 \u00b1 0.01%), in comparison to \n\nOnOi and OnpH treatments, remain elusive and, since these differences are small, these variations may \n\nhave no ecological significance at all. At T21 there was no similar pattern in any of the taxa. \n\nThe previous published results obtained from superficial sediments showed that the interactive \n\neffects of oil contamination and reduced seawater pH had a significant effect on the relative abundance \n\nof active members of the order Desulfobacterales (Coelho et al. 2016a; Coelho et al. 2015). In the present \n\nstudy, the interaction between these two factors was not a significant driver of the relative abundance of \n\nthis taxon (Figure S III-2). The biogeochemical characteristics of the sediment barrier could have \n\nattenuated the effects of the factors tested. \n\nConclusions \n\nPrevious results indicated that the interaction between oil hydrocarbon contamination and \n\nreduced seawater pH may have a significant effect on the composition of the active microbial \n\ncommunities in surface sediments (Coelho et al. 2016a; Coelho et al. 2015). Here, we now show that, \n\nalthough the group specific analysis indicated some significant taxa-specific responses, namely a clear \n\neffect of low seawater pH on Desulfobulbaceae family after 7 days and the appearance of several putative \n\nanaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria after 21 days, the overall bacterial community did not \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nsignificantly change. Neither the independent nor the interactive effect of reduced seawater pH and \n\nhydrocarbon contamination had a significant compositional impact on the overall structure of the \n\nbacterial communities inhabiting the subsurface sediment. It is possible that the initial oil hydrocarbon \n\nbiodegradation in the surface layer combined with its low oil permeability and sediment chemical \n\nbuffering capacity may attenuated the effects of oil contamination and low pH on subsurface sediment \n\nbacterial communities. Overall, this study provided evidences that bacterial communities inhabiting \n\nsubsurface sediment may be less susceptible to the independent and interactive effects of reduced \n\nseawater pH and oil contamination in a scenario of ocean acidification. \n\nFunding \n\nThis work was supported by the Foundation for Science and Technology at the Portuguese \n\nMinistry of Education and Science [UID/AMB/50017 for research unit CESAM; \n\nSFRH/BD/86447/2012 for AL and SFRH/BPD/92366/2013 for FJRC], which is co-funded by \n\nnational funds and FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020.

A semidiurnal tidal regime was \n\nimplemented with individual microcosms filled and emptied in approximately 1 min, during which about \n\n50% of the water volume (1.5L) was renewed (flow-through non-recirculated). A 14-hour diurnal light \n\ncycle (average day length in summer months at Portuguese latitudes) was simulated with light intensity \n\nvarying from 50% to 100% of the total fluorescence tube intensity. A water bath ensured that sediment \n\ntemperature was maintained constant at 19 \u00baC. Synthetic seawater was prepared by dissolving a \n\ncommercially available salt mixture (Tropic Marin Pro Reef salt \u2013 Tropic Marine, Germany) into \n\nfreshwater purified by a four-stage reverse osmosis unit (Aqua-win RO-6080) at 32 ppt as measured by \n\na refractometer. Salinity and temperature were defined to correspond to conditions recorded at the \n\nsampling location and were kept constant (Coelho et al. 2013). Before the experimental spiking with oil, \n\nthe sediment was stabilized during 21 days and seawater pH was gradually adjusted in external glass \n\nreservoirs to the desired test conditions. The pH was monitored daily at the end of each low tide with a \n\ncalibrated pH meter (Orion StarTM portable pH meter, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, \n\nUSA). \n\nData analysis  \n\nIn QIIME, .fasta and .qual files were used as input for the split_libraries.py script. Default \n\narguments were used except for the minimum sequence length, which was set at 218 bps after removal \n\nof forward primers and barcodes; reverse primers were removed using the 'truncate only' argument and \n\na sliding window test of quality scores was enabled with a value of 50 as suggested in the QIIME \n\ndescription for the script. OTUs were selected using UPARSE with usearch7 (Edgar 2013). Chimera \n\nchecking was performed using the UCHIME algorithm. First reads were filtered with the -fastq_filter \n\ncommand and the following arguments -fastq_trunclen 250, -fastq_maxee 0.5 and -fastq_truncqual 15. \n\nSequences were then dereplicated and sorted using the -derep_fulllength and - sortbysize commands. \n\nOTU clustering was performed using the -cluster_otus command (cut-off threshold at 97%). An \n\nadditional chimera check was subsequently applied using the -uchime_ref command with the gold.fa \n\ndatabase (http://drive5.com/uchime/gold.fa). In QIIME, representative sequences were selected using \n\nthe pick_rep_set.py script in QIIME using the 'most_abundant' method. Reference sequences of OTUs \n\nwere assigned taxonomies using default arguments in the assign_taxonomy.py script in QIIME with the \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nrdp method (Wang et al. 2007). In the assign_taxonomy.py function, the most recent Greengenes \n\ndatabase (ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/gg_13_8_otus.tar.gz) was used \n\nfor OTU picking and taxonomic assignment.

Their application will certainly increase the bioavailability of oil, which may \n\nenhance microbial biodegradation. However, it may also increase the mass transfer of constituents of oil \n\nto the sediment surface, where their long-term environmental impact is severer. In this study, we aimed \n\nat investigating the effects of oil contamination and chemical dispersant addition on the fate of oil \n\nhydrocarbons [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and alkanes] in a estuarine port sediment. For \n\nthat a microcosms experimental setup was used to evaluate the impact of chemical oil dispersants on the \n\nstructure of the benthic bacterial communities from a port environment by a 16S rRNA gene based high-\n\nthroughput sequencing approach. In addition, the effect of oil-dispersant on putative functional traits \n\nwas evaluated. The results revealed that chemically dispersed oil, while having similar alkane \n\nconcentration, seems to enhance PAHs accumulation in sediments and altered the relative abundance of \n\nsome less abundant bacterial groups. Nonetheless, overall no significant effect was detected on the \n\nbacterial community composition at the uppermost sediment layer, which was stable to the independent \n\nand interactive effects of oil contamination and dispersant addition. In sum, chemical dispersants \n\nenhance the mass transfer of PAH to the sediment surface but do not impose a significant shift to the \n\ncomposition of the overall bacterial communities from port environments. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Alcanivoraceae, Surfactants, PAHs, Dispersant, Helicobacteraceae, Oil spill \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nChemical dispersants are used to mitigate the environmental impact of oil spills (National \n\nResearch Council 2005; Prince 2015; Walker 2017). Non-dispersed oil will agglomerate into large surface \n\nslicks and oil droplets, thus reducing the oil-water interface to a minimum (National Research Council \n\n2005). It is at this interface that bacterial biodegradation preferentially occurs (Rosenberg and Rosenberg \n\n1981). Therefore, if requirements of other potentially limiting factors (e.g. nutrients and oxygen) are \n\nfulfilled, this minimal interface will drastically reduce oil bioavailability and, consequently, limit oil \n\nhydrocarbon biodegradation. To counter this, chemical dispersants in combination with wave action will \n\nsynergistically promote the formation and stabilization of micron-size oil-in-water micelles (National \n\nResearch Council 2005). This will drastically increase the oil-water interface and may potentiate oil \n\nbioremediation. However, the use of chemical dispersants is a subject of debate among scientists \n\n(Kleindienst et al. 2015a; Kleindienst et al. 2016; Prince et al. 2016). Experimental results can be \n\ncontradictory, with biodegradation being enhanced (Brakstad et al. 2014; Ferguson et al. 2017), inhibited \n\n(Foght and Westlake 1982; Kleindienst et al. 2015b) or not significantly altered (Rahsepar et al. 2016) by \n\nthe addition of a dispersant. In the intervening time, chemical dispersants may increase the reach and \n\nexposure of  to the toxic constituents of oil (Adams et al. 2014; Carls et al. 2008; Redman et al. 2017), of \n\nwhich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are particularly problematic (Barron et al. 2003; \n\nShimada and Fujii?Kuriyama 2004). In addition, ecotoxicological studies have repeatedly shown that \n\nchemical dispersion increases oils acute toxicity to aquatic organisms (Almeda et al. 2014; Anderson et \n\nal. 2014; Barron et al. 2003; Gardiner et al. 2013; Goodbody-Gringley et al. 2013; \u00d6zhan et al. 2014; \n\nRico-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2013), with toxicological effects being frequently correlated with PAHs \n\nconcentration (Gardiner et al. 2013; \u00d6zhan et al. 2014; Radniecki et al. 2013). \n\nIn efficient oil dispersion interventions, oil-dispersant micelles are expected to be buoyantly \n\nentrained in the water column and, consequently, restrained from reaching the seabed and shorelines \n\n(Beyer et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012). Furthermore, the micellization of oil by chemical dispersants is \n\nthought to reduce oil \"stickiness\" and, consequently, reduce oil-sediment interactions (Lessard and \n\nDeMarco 2000). Yet, in vitro simulations revealed that by reducing micelle size (Khelifa et al. 2008), \n\ndispersant addition may promote the adhesion of oil to suspended particulate matter, thus facilitating \n\nmass transfer to the marine sediments (Cai et al. 2017; Gong et al. 2014b; Khelifa et al. 2008). Even in \n\nthe deep sea sediments, dispersant-enhanced mass transfer of oil hydrocarbons was found to occur in \n\nthe aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Romero et al. 2015).  \n\nThe ideal environmental fate of oil hydrocarbons is their complete oxidation. This is normally \n\nachieved through the metabolic association of a multitaxon microbial community (Coelho et al. 2016a; \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\nCoelho et al. 2016b). Bacteria, due to their versatile metabolic features, participate directly (McGenity et \n\nal. 2012; Yakimov et al. 2007), and indirectly [e.g. nitrogen cycling (Musat et al. 2006; Toccalino et al. \n\n1993) and biosurfactant synthesis (Ali Khan et al. 2017)] in this metabolic network. However, chemically \n\ndispersed oil may disrupt this network (Kleindienst et al. 2015a) by inhibiting some bacterial groups [e.g. \n\nkey alkane-degrading bacteria (Hamdan and Fulmer 2011; Kleindienst et al. 2015b) and ammonia-\n\noxidizing bacteria (Radniecki et al. 2013)]. Structural changes in the composition of bacterial \n\ncommunities are known to affect microbial processes (Kleindienst et al. 2015a) and, consequently, these \n\ncan delay or preclude a full environment restoration. \n\nThe sedimentation of oil hydrocarbons is undesirable in oil response strategies since the strong \n\nadhesion forces between oil and sediment particles decrease oil hydrocarbon bioavailability and this may \n\nconsequently perpetuate the associated environmental impact (Lee 2002). Also, with time, oil \n\nhydrocarbons will be inhumed in anoxic sediments where oil hydrocarbon biodegradation is slower \n\n(McGenity 2014). Consequently, the use of dispersants in shallow near shore waters (e.g. ports) is \n\nstrongly regulated or banned due to these concerns, despite their impact and fate have not been fully \n\nelucidated (National Research Council 2005). However, the response of the benthic bacterial community \n\nin port environments may differ from that of other less contaminated sites. Ports are particularly prone \n\nto oil spills and port activities expose surrounding benthic ecosystems to continuous xenobiotic pollution \n\nfrom the discharge bulk cargo, bilge and ballast water, soot emissions and water contamination by oil-\n\nderived fuels and lubricants and anti-fouling paints (Darbra et al. 2009). Furthermore, port sediments \n\ncan be adversely affected by anthropogenic activities from nearby industrialized and urbanized regions \n\n(Gomes et al. 2013). Therefore, the composition of the benthic bacterial communities and their catabolic \n\ngene pool at sites subject to chronic xenobiotic pollution is distinct that of less contaminated sites \n\n(Gomes et al. 2007; Gomes et al. 2008; Gomes et al. 2013; Tavares et al. 2016). Also, in response to oil \n\ncontamination events, the compositional changes in the benthic bacterial community from chronically \n\ncontaminated sites is not profound, yet their metabolic response is rapid and the oil hydrocarbon \n\nbiodegradation rate is faster than in pristine sites (Pa\u00efss\u00e9 et al. 2010). Thus, when determining the net \n\nbenefit of chemical dispersant addition in port environments it should taken in consideration the \n\nresponse of this precondition bacterial community. \n\nIn this study, we aimed at investigating the effects of oil contamination and chemical dispersant \n\naddition on the fate of oil hydrocarbons in estuarine port sediments and evaluate their impact on the \n\nstructure of the benthic bacterial communities. In addition, the effect of oil-dispersant interaction on \n\nputative functional traits was evaluated. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nMicrocosm Experiment \n\nA microcosm simulation was conducted in an experimental life support system (ELSS) that was \n\npreviously validated to test the effects of reduced seawater pH and UV radiation on the benthic \n\nbiosphere (Coelho et al. 2013). This flow-through system allows the control of light intensity, tide regime \n\nand temperature. The ELSS supports up to 32 microcosms in four independent modules, which allows \n\nthe testing of a total of eight different treatments (assuming four replicates each). More information \n\nregarding the architecture of the microcosms apparatus can be found in Coelho et al. 2013 (Coelho et al. \n\n2013). \n\nSediment cores were collected at low neap tide on the 23th of May 2016 at a branch of the Ria \n\nde Aveiro (40\u00b038'38?N 8\u00b044'53?W). The Ria de Aveiro is a shallow estuarine coastal lagoon with a mean \n\ndepth of ?1 m, but with a deeper central channel that accesses the port infrastructures. It is influenced \n\nby freshwater, through the various rivers that drain there, and by the ocean with which it communicates \n\nthrough a single artificial channel. The sampling site was a barren intertidal mudflat, briefly exposed \n\nduring low neap tide, located in between various shipping harbours and adjacent to a fuel storage facility \n\n(Figure IV-1). Sediment cores (?13 cm high) were collected intact [following guidelines (Cravo-Laureau \n\net al. 2017)], immediately placed into individual glass microcosms (glass tanks of 25 cm in height, 28 cm \n\nin length and 12.4 cm in width, and with a headspace volume of approximately 3 L) and transferred \n\ndirectly to the ELSS. At the ELSS, the 16 sediment cores were distributed equally among the four \n\nindependent modules. A semidiurnal tidal regime filled and emptied the microcosms in approximately 1 \n\nminute and renewed around 50% of the total water volume. The ELSS water flow was continuous. A \n\n14-hour diurnal light cycle was programmed with light intensity varying between 50% and 100%. The \n\ntemperature of the sediment cores was maintained at 19 \u00baC by immersion in a refrigerated water bath \n\n(Seachill TR10, Teco S.R.L., Italy). Synthetic seawater was prepared by dissolving a commercial salt \n\nmixture (Tropic Marin Pro Reef salt \u2013 Tropic Marine, Germany) in freshwater purified by a four-stage \n\nreverse osmosis unit (Aqua-win RO-6080 - Aqua-win, Taiwan) and salinity was adjusted to ?32 ppt as \n\nmeasured through a refractometer (V2 Refractometer - Tropic Marine, Germany ). Photoperiod (14 h), \n\nsalinity (32.6\u00b1 1.5 ppt) and temperature (19 \u00b1 1.5 \u00baC) were defined to simulate the conditions recorded \n\nat the sampling location and were kept constant (Coelho et al. 2015). \n\nA factorial experiment was designed using 16 microcosms with two factors: Oil and Dispersant, \n\neach with two conditions (with and without). Four experimental treatments were defined: \"Cont\" \n\n(control, without oil and without dispersant), \"OnDisp\" (without oil and with dispersant), \"OnOi\" (with \n\noil and without dispersant) and \"OiDisp\" (with oil and with dispersant). A stabilization period of 19 days \n\nwas performed before experimental oil contamination to allow the biological communities in sediment \n\ncores to acclimatize to microcosm conditions. The experiment began when the surface waters of \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nrespective microcosms were contaminated. The contamination was performed immediately following a \n\nsimulated high tide, during 5 consecutive tide cycles. Previously, oil was allowed to evaporate in an \n\naluminium tray, in a fume hood at ambient temperature, for 24 hours. This step was carry out because \n\ndispersant application guidelines advocate a window of opportunity of 1-2 days, since a too early \n\napplication will disperse the most volatile hydrocarbons (Aurand and Coelho 2005) and a too late \n\napplication will not disperse oil efficiently (National Research Council 2005). Also, in real scenarios, \n\nenvironmental protection response is lagged due to logistics and decision-making. This weathering \n\nprocess reduced oil weight by 12.53% (w/w). Next, to assure that all dispersant was used to create the \n\noil:dispersant in water emulsions, water from the system, oil and dispersant were mixed at a \n\nwater:oil:dispersant ratio of 25:7.5:0.375 in a 50 mL plastic falcon tube. The same was done with artificial \n\nseawater and oil (25:7.5) for the OnOi treatment and with artificial seawater and dispersant (25:0.375) \n\nfor the OnDisp treatment. These mixtures were mechanically shaken (Rocker-Shaker MR-12; Bioscan, \n\nRiga, Latvia) at 70 rpm at a 10\u00ba angle for one hour and immediately transferred to the respective \n\nmicrocosms. The oil:dispersant ratio applied was set at 20:1 in accordance to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines \n\nand Maritime Safety Agency recommendations (ITOPF 2014). Also, at this ratio the smallest micelle \n\ndroplet size is achieved (Khelifa et al. 2008). Arabian Light Crude oil was provided by the PETROGAL \n\nrefinery (Matosinhos, Portugal) and the chemical dispersant Slickgone NS was provided by DASIC \n\nInternational Lda (Hampshire, United Kingdom). Since this experiment objectively focuses on the \n\nimpact of chemically dispersed oil and not that of the chemical dispersant solely, this dispersant was \n\nintentionally chosen because of its lower direct toxicity to fish (juvenile sea bass) in comparison to other \n\ncommercialized chemical dispersants (Dussauze et al. 2015). \n\nSampling and DNA extraction \n\nFor DNA extraction and hydrocarbon quantification, four replicates of sediment mini-cores (of \n\n\u00f8 1.0 cm and \u00f8 1.5 cm, respectively) were extracted per microcosms 21 days after oil contamination \n\n(T21). Additional cores were extracted 1 day after oil contamination (T1) and at sampling site (Env) for \n\nhydrocarbon analysis only. The top centimetre of each core was sliced and replicates were pooled into 2 \n\nmL plastic microtubes for DNA extraction and into aluminium cartridges for hydrocarbons analysis. All \n\nsamples were immediately stored at -80 \u00baC until further use. DNA extraction was performed using \n\nFastDNATM Spin kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) for 0.5 g of sediment following instructions of the \n\nmanufacturer. DNA quality was confirmed by PCR amplification, Nanodrop and Qubit quantification \n\nbefore shipping for analysis. \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nIllumina MiSeq sequencing \n\nThe V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR (94\u00baC for 3 minutes, 28 cycles of \n\n94\u00baC for 30s, 53\u00baC for 40s and 72\u00baC for 60s, and 72\u00baC for 5 minutes) using primers 515F (5\u00b4-\n\nGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3\u00b4) and 806R (5\u00b4-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u00b4), with \n\nbarcode on the forward primer, and the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA). After \n\namplification, PCR products were checked in 2% agarose gel. Pooled samples were purified using \n\ncalibrated Ampure XP beads. Library preparation and sequencing were performed at MR DNA \n\n \n\nFigure IV-1- Sampling site (A) was barren mudflat briefly exposed during neap. It is located in Ria de Aveiro system \n\nin the central Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula (?) adjacent to fuel deposits (B) and a \n\ncommercial shipping harbour (C) \n\n \n\n(www.mrdnalab.com, Shallowater, TX, USA) on a MiSeq sequencing platform following standard \n\nIllumina protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nHydrocarbons quantification \n\nMicrocosm and environmental sediment samples were extracted using a soxhlet apparatus \n\nfollowing EPA Method 3540C (Protection and Agency 1996). Approximately 4 g of previously \n\nlyophilized sediment was extracted with 150 mL of dichloromethane for 24 h in a fume hood, \n\nmaintaining the condensers circulating water at around 4 \u00baC. Before extraction, all sediments were spiked \n\nwith 25 \u00b5L of a solution of deuterated PAHs (acenaphthene-d10, chrysene-d12, naphthalene-d8, perylene-\n\nd12, 1,4-dichlorobenzene-d4 and phenanthrene-d10 corresponding to a final concentration of 0.25 \u00b5gL-1 \n\neach) and deuterated alkanes (tetracosane-d50 and hexadecane-d34 at a final concentration of 0.52 mM \n\neach) as surrogates to determine extraction efficiency. The extract was evaporated in a rotary evaporator \n\nat 35\u00baC to ?10 mL, afterwards additional 10 mL of hexane were added and again reduced at 60\u00baC to ?2-\n\n4 mL. When required, extracts were ice-cooled to minimize volatilization of oil hydrocarbons. Extracts \n\nwere cleaned by filtering through a deactivated alumina:silica gel column (2:1) topped with anhydrous \n\nNaSO4. The column was sequentially eluted with 15 mL of hexane and 30 mL of \n\nhexane:dichloromethane (1:1), and all fractions were collected. The eluate was reduced to ?1 mL in a \n\nrotary evaporator at 60\u00baC and to ?200 \u00b5L under a gentle N2 flow. Immediately before injection in the \n\nchromatograph, each sample was spiked with 25 \u00b5L of hexamethylbenzene (final concentration of 1.5 \n\n\u00b5M) and 1,2-dibromobenzene (0.52 mM) as internal standards for PAHs and alkanes, respectively. \n\nAnalytic separation and detection was conducted on a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS \n\nShimadzu QP2010 Ultra) coupled to an AOC 20i autosampler (Shimadzu, Japan) and with the electron \n\nimpact ionization (EI) at 70 eV. Injector and transfer-line temperatures were both set a 350 \u00baC, while \n\nthe ion source was set at 230\u00baC. For PAHs, samples were injected in the splitless mode and the selected \n\nion monitoring (SIM) mode was used for the detection of all 16 EPA priority PAHs. Alkanes samples \n\nwere injected in split mode and detection was done in full scanning mode from m/z 20 to m/z 500. For \n\nboth, 1 \u00b5L of sample was injected automatically with a 10 \u00b5L glass syringe into a VF-5ms column (30 m \n\nx 0.25 mm with 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Helium was used \n\nas the carrier gas and the linear velocity was set at 40 cm s-1. The oven temperature conditions were set \n\nat 60 \u00baC for 1 min, followed firstly by a rise to 200 \u00baC at a 10 \u00baC per minute rate, then at 5 \u00baC per minute \n\nuntil 300 \u00baC where it stabilized for 8 min. All the analytes were quantified through calibration curves of \n\nanalyte/internal standard created using a range of concentrations of certified analytical standards. \n\nCertified internal standards, deuterated alkanes (tetracosane-d50 and hexadecane-d34) and deuterated \n\nPAHs solution were all supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All the deuterated surrogates \n\nwere recovered with an efficiency > 70% and the standard deviation was between 10-15%. \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\nHigh-throughput sequencing data was analyzed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial \n\nEcology (QIIME) software package (http://qiime.org; Accessed 01 January 2014) according to \n\npublished recommendations and following previously described methods (Cleary et al. 2015; Coelho et \n\nal. 2016a; Kuczynski et al. 2011) with the exception of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking \n\nstep, where the UPARSE (Edgar 2013) clustering method and chimera check were used. In QIIME, \n\n.fasta and .qual files were used as input for the split_libraries.py script. Default arguments were used \n\nexcept for the minimum sequence length, which was set at 218 bps after removal of forward primers \n\nand barcodes; reverse primers were removed using the 'truncate only' argument and a sliding window \n\ntest of quality scores was enabled with a value of 50 as suggested in the QIIME description for the script. \n\nOTUs were selected using UPARSE with usearch7 (Edgar 2013). Chimera checking was performed \n\nusing the UCHIME algorithm. First reads were filtered with the -fastq_filter command and the following \n\narguments -fastq_trunclen 250, -fastq_maxee 0.5 and -fastq_truncqual 15. Sequences were then \n\ndereplicated and sorted using the -derep_fulllength and - sortbysize commands. OTU clustering was \n\nperformed using the -cluster_otus command (cut-off threshold at 97%). An additional chimera check \n\nwas subsequently applied using the -uchime_ref command with the gold.fa database \n\n(http://drive5.com/uchime/gold.fa). In QIIME, representative sequences were selected using the \n\npick_rep_set.py script in QIIME using the 'most_abundant' method. Reference sequences of OTU were \n\nassigned taxonomies using default arguments in the assign_taxonomy.py script in QIIME with the RDP \n\nmethod (Wang et al. 2007). In the assign_taxonomy.py function, the most recent Greengenes database \n\n(ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/gg_13_8_otus.tar.gz) was used for OTU \n\npicking and taxonomic assignment. The make_otu_table.py script was used to produce an OTU by \n\nsample table containing the abundance and taxonomic assignment of bacterial OTUs. Sequences are \n\navailable at NCBI ShortRead Archive (BioProject n\u00ba PRJNA392217 and BioSample n\u00ba SAMN07285933- \n\nSAMN07285948). \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nThe OTU tables were uploaded to R software (version 3.1.1; http://www.r-project.org/) for \n\nremoval of unassigned and singleton OTU, chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences, statistical \n\ncomputing and graphic generation. A self-written function (Gomes et al. 2010) was used to estimate total \n\nrarefied OTU richness for each sample.  The top 5 most abundant phyla, classes, orders and families \n\n(excluding the \"Unclassified\" group) were determined by the overall mean relative abundance, calculated \n\nfrom the 16 datasets using the prop.table() function. Their relative abundance was plotted for each \n\ntreatment using the boxplot() function in the graphics package. Compositional differences among \n\ntreatments was assessed using principal coordinates analysis (PCO). The PCO was generated using the \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\ncmdscale() function in the R base package. Prior to the PCO, the raw data was log(x+1) transformed \n\nand used to produce a distance matrix with the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function in the vegan \n\npackage (Oksanen et al. 2012). An Adonis analysis was performed using the adonis() function in vegan \n\nto test the significance of these compositional differences to factors tested. The log(x+1) transformed \n\nBray-Curtis distance matrix was used as the response variable, oil and dispersant as factors and the \n\nnumber of permutations was set at 999. We also analyzed the differences in relative abundance for all \n\ntaxa (phylum to family) between treatments to the independent and interactive effects of oil \n\ncontamination and chemical dispersant addition, through a two-way ANOVA using the F-test [adapted \n\nfrom (Roy et al. 2013a)]. Beforehand, the scope of the analysis was set to the most relevant taxa by \n\nestablishing a threshold (overall mean relative abundance ?0.1 % all levels). ANOVA was computed by \n\nthe anova() function (stats package) applied to a linear regression model produced individually for each \n\ntaxa. The linear regression distribution was created by the glm() function (stats package) for each taxa \n\nusing relative abundance as response variable and a presence/absence matrix of oil and dispersant as \n\nfactors. An interaction term (*) was included to study the interaction between the two factors \n\n(oil*dispersant). The most significant (p-value &lt;0.05) taxa were plotted using the boxplot() function \n\nfrom the graphics package. \n\nPAHs and alkanes concentrations in the samples were calculated from the corresponding \n\ncalibration curves and then standardized for the weight of sediment analyzed (\u00b5g g-1). Concentrations \n\nwere plotted using boxplot() function from the graphics package in R. The independent and interactive \n\neffects of oil and dispersant addition were tested for significance (p-value ? 0.05) through an ANOVA \n\nF-test using the glm() and anova() functions from the stats package similarly as aforementioned above. \n\nHowever, input data for hydrocarbon quantification table was previously normalized for each \n\nhydrocarbon using this formula: ? ?\n \n;  where H is the hydrocarbon concentration and Hmax \n\nand Hmin is, respectively, the maximum and minimum hydrocarbon concentration in dataset. Variations \n\nin alkanes and PAHs concentrations between time points was measured for each microcosm as the \n\npercentile proportional difference between final and initial concentrations using this formula: ; \n\nin which Hf and Hi are, respectively, the final and initial hydrocarbon concentrations of all individual \n\nquantified hydrocarbons. These percentile differences were plotted using the boxplot() function the \n\ngraphics package. Significant differences in hydrocarbon concentrations (p-value? 0.05) between time \n\npoints were determined for each hydrocarbon and treated individually using glm() and anova() functions \n\nfrom the vegan package with oil hydrocarbon concentrations at T1 and T21 as data and time as factor. \n\nCarbon preferential index (CPI) was calculated for data from sampling site (ENV) using \n\npreviously described equation (Marzi et al. 1993). A CPI > 1 is indicative that hydrocarbons are of \n\npetrogenic origin while a CPI &lt;1 indicates that they are of biogenic origin (Pietrogrande et al. 2009). \n\nThe biodegradation was confirmed by comparing the variation of the C18/phytane ratio between \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\ntimepoints (Jones et al. 2008), assuming that linear alkanes are preferentially biodegraded, in comparison \n\nto branched alkanes (Hasinger et al. 2012; Peters et al. 2005), and that both have a similar volatilization \n\nrate (Esquinas et al. 2017). C18/phytane mean variation was calculated only for oil contaminated \n\ntreatments (OnOi and OiDisp). Pearson correlations between the relative abundance of the most \n\nrelevant classes, order, families and OTU, and hydrocarbon concentrations (\u00b5g g-1) were computed using \n\nrcorr() function from the Hmisc package and plotted using the corrplot() function from corrplot package \n\n(Wei and Simko 2016). Hydrocarbons concentrations were fit onto the PCO ordination using the envfit() \n\nfunction in the vegan package with permutations set to 999 and all other arguments set at default. Only \n\nsignificant (p-value&lt;0.05) ordinations where plotted. \n\nResults \n\nQuantification of oil hydrocarbons \n\nConcentrations for the 25 saturated linear alkanes quantified [from C12 (dodecane) to C36 \n\n(hexatriacontane) are plotted in Figure IV-2 for T1 and Env samples and in Figure IV-3 for T21 samples, \n\nwhile the statistical parameters obtained through ANOVA (F-value and p-value) are summarized in Table \n\nS IV-1 and Table S IV-2 for T1 and T21, respectively. As expected, almost all alkanes had a significant \n\nhigher concentration in oil contaminated microcosms (OnOi and OiDisp) at T1, with the exception for \n\nthe two lightest alkanes, C12 (which had a significant lower concentration) and C13. With time, \n\nconcentrations decreased and at T21 only alkanes C15 to C21 had a significant higher concentration in \n\noil-contaminated microcosm sediments. The chemical dispersion of oil only increased the concentration \n\nof some alkanes (C13 and C33-C36) at T1; and of C36 at T21 samples. Alkanes C24 to C29 had a significant \n\nhigher concentration in treatments with oil amendment (Cont and OnDisp). This reflects abnormally \n\nhigh measurements in some replicates and was interpreted as an artefact of the experimental procedure. \n\nThe concentrations of the 16 PAHs quantified are plotted alongside with ANOVA statistical parameters \n\n(F-value and p-value) in Figure IV-4 for T1 and Env samples and in Figure IV-5 for T21 samples. The \n\nresults indicate that the chemical dispersion of oil significantly increased the concentration of almost all \n\nPAHs at T1 [the exceptions are naphthalene, benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(b)fluoranthene], while at T21, \n\nonly phenanthrene and benzo(b)fluoranthene had a significant higher concentration in OiDisp. Contrary \n\nto the other PAHs, the concentration of naphthalene had a significant reduction in oil contaminated \n\nmicrocosms at T1. At Env, mean ?alkane and ?PAH concentration were 30.345 \u00b1 13.943 \u00b5g g-1 and \n\n0.518 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5g g-1, respectively, and the carbon preference index mean alkane concentration was 1.049 \n\nwhich is indicative that hydrocarbons present are of petrogenic origin. \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-2 - Boxplot of concentrations (\u00b5g g-1) of linear alkanes from C12 (dodecane) to C36 (hexatriacontane) \n\nin sediments at T1. \"Env\" (sampling site), \"Cont\" (without oil and without dispersant), \"OnDisp\" \n\n(without oil and with dispersant), \"OnOi\" (with oil and without dispersant) and \"OiDisp\" (with oil \n\nand with dispersant). \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-3 - Boxplot of concentrations (\u00b5g g-1) of linear alkanes from C12 (dodecane) to C36 (hexatriacontane) in \n\nsediments at T21. \"Cont\" (without oil and without dispersant), \"OnDisp\" (without oil and with \n\ndispersant), \"OnOi\" (with oil and without dispersant) and \"OiDisp\" (with oil and with dispersant)\n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-4 - Boxplot of concentrations (\u00b5g g-1) of the 16 PAHs labelled as priority pollutants by US-EPA in \n\nsediments from all replicates of the four treatments (Cont, OnDisp, OnOi and OiDisp) at timepoint \n\n1 and from sampling site (Env).

In general, results show that the \n\nconcentration of alkanes decreased considerably with time in oil contaminated treatments, with steeper \n\ndecrease in concentration in OiDisp. In OnOi (Figure IV-6A) the concentration of alkanes decreased \n\non average ?90% for C15-C19, >80% for C20-C22 and >70% for C14, C23 and C24, while in OiDisp C15-C22 \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-6 - Boxplot of percentile variation of hydrocarbon concentration in treatments OnOi (A and C) and \n\nOiDisp (B and D) for linear alkanes C12 (dodecane) to C36 (hexatriacontane) (A and B) and the 16 \n\nPAHs labeled as priority pollutants by US-EPA (C and D) between T1 and T21 (boxplot), and their \n\nmean concentration in sediments (\u00b5g g-1) at T1 ( )and at T21 ( ). \n\ndecreased >90% and linear alkanes C14, C23 and C24 >80% (Figure IV-6B). Nonetheless, the percent \n\nremoval was still >50% for the most abundant PAHs in petroleum [phenanthrene, fluorene and \n\nchrysene]. The influence of biodegradation in the overall hydrocarbons removal was determined by \n\ncomparing the C18/phytane ratio between timepoints T1 and T21 (Jones et al. 2008). This ratio decreased \n\non average >50% in both treatments (OnOi and OiDisp), indicating that biodegradation occurred (Snape \n\net al. 2006). The mean C18/phytane percent in OnOi decreased 55.842 \u00b1 15.694 %, which was slightly \n\nmore than in OiDisp (58.577 \u00b1 34.611 %).

The relative abundance of the \n\nfive most abundant phyla, classes, orders and families (excluding the \"unclassified\" bacterial group) were \n\nplotted in Figure IV-7. Sediment bacterial communities were dominated by the Proteobacteria phylum \n\n(mean relative abundance 52.32 \u00b1 1.77%). Within Proteobacteria, classes Gammaproteobacteria (22.82 \n\n\u00b1 2.22%) and Deltaproteobacteria (17.64 \u00b1 1.6%) were the most abundant.

Although these was no significant change in the overall structure of the bacterial \n\ncommunity, a taxon-specific analysis indicated that for the relative abundance of five less abundant (all \n\nhad a mean relative abundance below 1%) bacterial groups a significant variation occurred (ANOVA F-\n\ntest p-value ? 0.05) between treatments in response to the factor (independently and/or in interaction). \n\nThese bacterial groups are plotted alongside ANOVA parameters in Figure IV-9.

Prior to the PCO, the raw data was log10(x+1)-transformed and used to produce a distance \n\nmatrix based on the Bray-Curtis distance with the vegdist() function in vegan (Oksanen et al. 2012). \n\nThe first two explanatory axes are shown. \"Cont\" (without oil and without dispersant), \"OnDisp\" \n\n(without oil and with dispersant), \"OnOi\" (with oil and without dispersant) and \"OiDisp\" (with oil \n\nand with dispersant). Sequence read (from MiSeq Illumina) were assigned to OTU with QIIME \n\nsoftware (http://qiime.org) using the most recent Greengenes database \n\n(ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/gg_13_8_otus.tar.gz). \n\ndatasets may indicate a response from the bacterial taxon to hydrocarbon concentrations. A positive \n\ncorrelation would indicate that the bacterial taxon thrive or at least was not inhibit by higher hydrocarbon \n\nconcentrations and a negative correlation indicate that bacteria was inhibited and at least did not benefit \n\nfrom by higher hydrocarbon concentration. Notable bacterial groups that had a positive correlation with \n\nhydrocarbon concentration include the Alcanivoraceae family (Oceanospirillales order) which was \n\ncorrelated with linear alkanes C16 to C20 and Helicobacteraceae family (?-Proteobacteria class, \n\nCampylobacterales order) which was correlated with phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and  \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV-9 - Boxplot of the relative abundance of significant taxon at T21 in each datasets for the four treatments \n\n(Cont\" (without oil and without dispersant), \"OnDisp\" (without oil and with dispersant), \"OnOi\" \n\n(with oil and without dispersant) and \"OiDisp\" (with oil and with dispersant)).

Pearson correlation \n\nbetween the 50 most abundant OTUs and hydrocarbons concentrations was also calculated (Figure S \n\nIV-5). The information regarding their relative abundance and closest relative sequence obtained with \n\nNCBI-Blast is presented in Table S IV-3. The most notable correlations were the positive correlation \n\nbetween OTUs 2, 12879 and 2076 (belonging to the Helicobacteraceae family) and various PAHs (OTU_2 \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\nwith acenaphthene, fluorene and phenanthrene and OTU_12879 and OTU_2076 with acenaphthene, \n\nfluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene). \n\nDiscussion \n\nEffect of chemical dispersant on the fate of oil hydrocarbons \n\nChemical dispersants, by buoyantly entraining micelles in water column, are thought to reduce \n\nthe accumulation of oil at the sediment surface (Prince 2015). However, in in vitro simulations, chemical \n\ndispersants have been repeatedly found to facilitate the mass transfer of the micellized hydrocarbons to \n\nthe sediment surface, especially PAHs (Cai et al. 2017; Gong et al. 2014b; Khelifa et al. 2008). Our results \n\nindicate that the chemical dispersion of oil did not significantly reduce nor enhance the concentration of \n\nthe most abundant hydrocarbons (C14-C22 linear alkanes) at the sediment surface. However, an increase \n\nin the concentration was observed for almost all PAHs at T1, and for phenanthrene and \n\nbenzo[b]fluoranthene at T21. These results are consistent with those from previous experimental \n\nsimulations that indicated that chemical dispersants enhance PAHs concentration in sediments (Gong \n\net al. 2014b; Khelifa et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2016). The linear alkanes had significant higher concentration \n\nat T1, in particular for C14 to C25 alkanes, which are the most abundant hydrocarbons of weathered \n\nArabian light crude oil (Wang et al. 2003). At T21, this trend continued but the difference was attenuated \n\nand limited to alkanes C15 to C21. \n\nVariation in hydrocarbon concentration between timepoint was overall higher for linear alkanes \n\nthan for PAHs, mainly because biodegradation acts preferentially on the alkanes (Brakstad et al. 2014; \n\nHuesemann et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2016), whereas PAHs are intrinsically more recalcitrant to \n\nbiodegradation (Huesemann et al. 2004). A >50% decrease in the mean C18/phytane ratio confirms that \n\nbiodegradation was the major fate for the linear alkanes. This decrease was slightly higher in OiDisp than \n\nin OnOi, but this difference between treatments was not significant. Thus, although the application of \n\nchemical dispersants seem to enhance alkanes removal, probably by increasing in the physical desorption \n\nand percolation of alkane these hydrocarbons are ressuspended into the water column and subsequently \n\npurged out of the microcosms (Brakstad et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2016). \n\nIndependent and interactive effects of oil contamination and chemical dispersant on \n\nthe composition of bacterial communities and its putative functional traits \n\nThe dataset was overall dominated by proteobacterial OTUs, among which ?- and ?-\n\nProteobacteria were the predominant classes. This is in line with previous studies at the Ria de Aveiro \n\nwater system (Coelho et al. 2013; Gomes et al. 2013; Oliveira et al. 2014b) and other wetland sediment \n\nsamples (Mahmoudi et al. 2015; Rietl et al. 2016). Deltaproteobacterial OTU predominance is mainly \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nattributed to the sulfate-reducing bacteria from the Desulfobacterales order. This bacterial group \n\nfrequently dominates the bacterial community in anoxic barren wetland environments (Gomes et al. \n\n2013). Equally abundant was the order Acidimicrobiales, that although not frequently dominant in \n\nmarine sediments, has been reported as well expressive in the Ria de Aveiro samples (Gomes et al. 2013; \n\nOliveira et al. 2014b). \n\nPCO ordination and adonis statistical test of compositional OTU tables indicate that neither \n\nfactor nor their interaction are significant predictors of bacterial community composition at T21. This \n\ncontrasts with results from a closed pelagic microcosm simulation, where chemically dispersed oil, in \n\ncomparison to physically dispersed oil, was found to significantly alter the composition of the particle-\n\nassociated bacterial community (Kleindienst et al. 2015b). However, our results are in accordance with \n\nto those from sediment slurry incubations in arctic conditions, which showed that, despite chemical \n\ndispersants benefiting oil hydrocarbon biodegradation, the bacterial community was similar in oil-\n\ncontaminated treatments with and without chemical dispersants (Ferguson et al. 2017). \n\nCuriously, for oil contamination alone no significant change occurred in the core composition \n\nof the bacterial community. The bacterial community of oil contaminated microcosms may have been \n\nre-establishing its initial structure since hydrocarbons concentrations were substantially lower at T21. \n\nHowever, it is also possible that, since the sampling site was located in the proximity of a major fuel \n\ndepository and commercial port, chronic exposure to oil hydrocarbon pollution preconditioned the \n\nbacterial community (Pa\u00efss\u00e9 et al. 2010). Mean ?alkane and ?PAH concentration at sampling site are \n\nconsiderably higher than in many pristine sites (Louvado et al. 2015; Martins et al. 2004), yet in \n\ncomparison to other port sediments, they are of the same magnitude or higher (De Luca et al. 2004; \n\nYakimov et al. 2005), but also considerably lower than others (Bajt 2012; Tavares et al. 2016). Also, mean \n\n?PAH concentration (all PAH analyzed excluding acenaphthene and acenaphthylene) in Env was \n\napproximately 10x lower than in comparison with reference sediment NIST SRM 1941b (Wise et al. \n\n2004). Additionally, Env samples had CPI >1, which is indicative of hydrocarbons of petrogenic origin \n\n(Pietrogrande et al. 2009). Chronic oil pollution has been previously recognized to stabilize the \n\ncomposition of bacterial communities in relation to future oil contamination, not only due to a higher \n\nabundance of latent hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and generalist oil-degrading heterotrophic bacteria, but \n\nalso inducing a higher resistance of other bacteria to hydrocarbon toxicity (Pa\u00efss\u00e9 et al. 2010). In this \n\ndataset, the majority of the 50 most abundant OTU have a high similarity with sequences retrieved from \n\nhydrocarbon-contaminated environments. Although it has been demonstrated that, in chronically \n\npolluted sediments, additional oil input does not significantly change the composition of the bacterial \n\ncommunity, added hydrocarbons were found to be degraded quickly (Pa\u00efss\u00e9 et al. 2010). This contrasts \n\nwith more pristine sites accidentally contaminated with oil, where bacterial community changes more \n\ndrastically (Yakimov et al. 2004) and oil hydrocarbon biodegradation is slower (Bargiela et al. 2015). \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\nDespite the above-mentioned stability, a group-specific analysis revealed that the relative \n\nabundance of five bacterial taxa had a significant change in response to the independent and/or \n\ninteractive effect of oil hydrocarbon contamination and dispersant addition. Almost all of these bacterial \n\ngroups may be potentially involved in hydrocarbon and/or xenobiotic degradation. In example, \n\nmembers of the Alcanivoraceae family, which are considered obligate oil-degraders (Yakimov et al. 2007) \n\nand their abundance is tightly coupled to the presence of oil hydrocarbons, more specifically, to the \n\npresence of short to medium linear alkanes (Joye et al. 2014), had significant higher abundance in oil \n\ncontaminated treatments. Coherently, this family also had a positive correlation with the concentration \n\nof linear alkanes C16 to C20.  \n\nThe interactive effects of oil and dispersant addition had a significant reduction in the relative \n\nabundance of candidate division SBR1031. This bacterial group has never been described as oil \n\nhydrocarbon degrading bacterial group, yet it has been occasionally detected in hydrocarbon rich \n\nmatrixes, namely in hydrocarbon-contaminated marine environments (An et al. 2004) and in sediments \n\nnear a terrestrial gas seep (Neubeck et al. 2017). Also, members of these bacterial group are potentially \n\ninvolved in acetogenesis through the reduction of ethanol (Xia et al. 2016) and thus may have a role in \n\nthe anaerobic degradation of oil hydrocarbons. In this work, their relative abundance had a significant \n\nincrease in OnOi, but in OiDisp it was significantly lower. The addition of chemical dispersants, by \n\nsignificantly increasing PAHs bioavailability, could have impacted the relative abundance of candidate \n\ndivision SBR1031. However, candidate division SBR1031 did not have any negative correlation with \n\nPAH concentrations. Possibly, dispersant addition could have increased the concentration of other not \n\nquantified, but similarly toxic, pollutant. In contrast, order Legionellales and family Phyllobacteriaceae had \n\nsignificant higher relative abundance in OiDisp. Both have been directly or indirectly linked in oil \n\nhydrocarbon biodegradation (Bacosa et al. 2015; Lai et al. 2011c). \n\nSpearman correlation analysis between hydrocarbons concentration and bacteria abundance \n\nrevealed some interesting interactions for some bacterial groups (e.g. candidate divisions OM190, its \n\nsubtaxon agg27 and order Ignavibacteriales) that are intrinsically involved in the nitrogen cycle \n\n(Gonzalez-Martinez et al. 2015; Mardanov et al. 2016; Schmid et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2015). These \n\ngroups had a negative correlation with the concentration of 4- and 5- ring PAHs. The OM190/agg24 \n\nbacterial is characteristically involved in nitrification (Schmid et al. 2000), whereas order Ignavibacteriales \n\nhas been linked to various metabolic pathways in the nitrogen cycle (e.g. nitrification (Mardanov et al. \n\n2016), denitrification (Liu et al. 2012a; Zhang et al. 2015), and anammox (Gonzalez-Martinez et al. \n\n2015)). PAHs addition has been reported to have a negative impact on nitrification (Lindgren et al. 2014), \n\ndenitrification (Pietroski et al. 2015) and the nitrogen cycle in general (Scott et al. 2014), therefore \n\njustifying the significant and negative correlation between these taxa and PAHs concentration. \n\nMeanwhile, the Helicobacteraceae family (?-protebacteria:Campylobacterales; mean relative abundance: \n\n3.325\u00b11.333%), had a positive correlation with phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\nbenzo[b]fluoranthene. Genera from this family (e.g. Sulfurimonas and Sulfuricurvum) are frequent in marine \n\nsediments amended with 3- and 4-ring PAHs (Obi et al. 2017; Stauffert et al. 2014). Thus, a strong and \n\nsignificant correlation with PAHs concentrations may indicate that the Helicobacteraceae family may \n\ninclude putative PAH-degrading bacteria. \n\nConclusions \n\nThis study showed that chemically dispersed oil did not cause significant change to the overall \n\ncomposition of the benthic bacterial community from port sediments. The chronic oil pollution at \n\nsampling site may have preconditioned the response of benthic bacterial communities to additional oil \n\ninput. However, and despite the aforementioned stability, some changes were observed among putative \n\nhydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. Also, the overall impact on oil hydrocarbon removal is ambiguous since \n\ndespite alkane concentrations having decreased substantially with time, the concentration of \n\nphenanthrene and benzo(b)fluoranthene in sediments was significantly enhanced by dispersant addition \n\n21 days after oil contamination. In this study, it was concluded that the addition of a chemical dispersant \n\nhad no effects on the overall composition of port sediment bacterial communities after oil contamination \n\nand did not contribute to improve the process of oil hydrocarbons removal. Yet, an in-depth analysis of \n\nthe effects of chemical dispersant addition on ultimate fate of the sediment bonded oil hydrocarbons, \n\nand their turnover rate, is require to determine to the net benefit of chemical dispersant use in oil spill \n\nresponse in port areas. \n\nFunding \n\nThis work was supported by the Foundation for Science and Technology at the Portuguese \n\nMinistry of Education and Science [UID/AMB/50017 for CESAM research unit; PEst-\n\nC/QUI/UI0062/2013 for QOPNA research unit; SFRH/BD/86447/2012 for AL, \n\nSFRH/BPD/92366/2013 for FJRC and SFRH/BPD/101919/2014 for VO], which is co-funded by \n\nnational funds and FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020.

Cold seeps linked to subsurface oil reservoirs (e.g. mud volcanoes) will \n\ntrickle oil through this sediment barrier, where a dense heterotrophic microbial community will actively \n\ndegrade it, creating a local biological hotspot. Yet despite biodegradation occurring under these \n\nchallenging abiotic conditions, the bacterial players involved are poorly understood. Also, by adhering \n\nto the sinking sediment particles, accidentally released oil hydrocarbons will settle at the sediment surface, \n\nand, with time, it will be inhumed into the adjacent anaerobic layers. There, since biodegradation is \n\nsubstantially less efficient, oil may persist for long periods. Thus, although, aerobic and anaerobic \n\nbiodegradation processes are determinant for oil decontamination, the fate of oil hydrocarbons will be \n\nheavily influenced by the efficiency of the initial aerobic biodegradation by the microbial communities \n\ninhabiting the surface sediment layer. However, some present and future scenarios (e.g. deep sea \n\nconditions, ocean acidification and the application of chemical dispersants) may impose changes to this \n\nbacterial-driven metabolic turnover. Yet the biogeochemical properties of sediments and the adaptation \n\nof some benthic bacterial community may attenuate their impact. In this thesis, the bacterial response to \n\nthese scenarios was inferred by field data and/or was experimentally analyzed. In general, the results \n\nobtained indicate that the sediment bacterial communities can show a remarkable resilience to oil \n\nhydrocarbon contamination. \n\nThe deep sea sediment surface is an overlooked sink for released oil hydrocarbons. The mass \n\ntransfer of oils most recalcitrant compounds (e.g. PAH) to the deep sea sediment surface may occur \n\nthrough the vertical settling of oil-sediment aggregates. Once settled, they will be available to the local \n\nbacterial community, which is speculated to have an opportunistic life strategy as an adaptation to the \n\ndeep sea oligotrophic environment. PAH biodegradation at the DSS could be inhibited by abiotic \n\nconditions such as low temperature and hydrostatic high pressure, but the adaptation of local bacterial \n\ncommunities to these abiotic extremities may counter this. Also, occasional underwater hydrocarbon \n\nseeps can be found throughout deep sea surface. These seeps may potentially release, annually, an \n\namount of oil hydrocarbons substantially higher than that released by accidental oil spills. Mud volcanoes \n\nare included among these geological formations. At the mud volcanoes sediments, a diverse and dense \n\necosystem occurs and is sustained by the heterotrophic microbial community that actively scavenges \n\nthese seeped oil hydrocarbons. Using samples from the deep sea mud volcanoes (inactive and active \n\ncraters) and from a reference site (abyssal plains) from the gulf of Cadiz, the PAH-degrading bacterial \n\ncommunity was enriched, by using a culture medium with added phenanthrene and chrysene as main \n\ncarbon sources, and isolates were obtained. In general, the isolates were dominated by Bacillus-like \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\nbacteria. This predominance was unexpected when considering that the Bacillaceae family is, normally, \n\npoorly represented in the PAH-degrading community of marine environments in general. Nonetheless, \n\nthese results are coherent with other studies from other cold seep-related environments and reveal that \n\nin these environment, the Bacillaceae family may be involved in PAH biodegradation at the deep sea. \n\nIn contrast to current deep sea abiotic conditions, the overall impact on bacterial processes of \n\nthe predicted abiotic conditions of the future ocean are harder to assert and may require their simulation \n\nunder controlled microcosm conditions. Ocean acidification, an indirect consequence of global warming, \n\nis known to alter key biogeochemical cycles, consequently impacting marine ecosystems. In previous \n\nmicrocosm simulations, the interactive effect of seawater acidification and oil contamination was shown \n\nto alter the composition of the core active bacterial community and reduce the abundance of active \n\nmembers of the anaerobic oil-degrading Desulfobacterales order at the superficial sediments. In this \n\nthesis, using samples from the same microcosm simulations, we conclude that this effect does not seem \n\nto extend to the subsurface sediments throughout the experiment. Although a taxon-specific analysis \n\nrevealed that, although the relative abundance of some bacterial groups changed in response to the \n\nindependent and/or interactive effects of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination, these were not \n\nexpressed in the overall bacterial community inhabiting the subsurface sediments (?5 cm), which was \n\nstable to the abiotic changes imposed. It is proposed that both seawater acidification and oil \n\ncontamination were attenuated by the sub-adjacent sediment layer that may have functioned as a barrier \n\nand buffer. \n\nOil spills, although responsible for a small fraction of all oil discharged into the ocean, can have \n\ncatastrophic effect at regional scale. To mitigate this effect, response strategies are employed, often \n\ninvolving the use of chemical dispersants. However, their use is controversial because the potential \n\nbenefits may not compensate potential drawbacks. Chemical dispersants will increase oil bioavailability, \n\nwhich may enhance hydrocarbon biodegradation but may also increase the exposure of marine biota to \n\ntoxic constituents and degradation products. Also, the use of dispersants may increase the mass transfer \n\nof oil hydrocarbons to the sediment. Although some studies have addressed the fate of chemically \n\ndispersed oil, until now none had tested their potential impact on benthic bacterial communities in \n\ncoastal port areas.  \n\nHere, a multi-factorial microcosm simulation was performed to evaluate the interactive and \n\nindependent effect of oil and dispersant addition on the bacterial community composition of intact \n\nsediment cores and on hydrocarbon concentration at the sediments superficial layer. The results revealed \n\nthat chemical dispersion of oil did have a significant effect on the concentration of n-alkane in the \n\nsediments. However, chemical dispersants significantly increased the mass transfer of PAHs to the \n\nsediments. and altered the relative abundance of some putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial groups. \n\nHowever, despite the changes detected in the relative abundance of putative oil hydrocarbon degraders, \n\nthe overall composition of the bacterial community was stable to the tested experimental the \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\nindependent and interactive effects of the oil contamination and dispersant addition. The previous \n\nexposure of the sediment bacterial communities to chronic oil hydrocarbon pollution in the port area \n\nmay have preconditioned the bacterial communities to oil contamination. \n\nOverall, this report broadens our understanding of bacteria-oil interactions at the sediments. \n\nNonetheless, several questions persist. A microcosm simulation of an oil contamination event under \n\ndeep sea conditions, although logistically challenging, would provide new insights on the microbial \n\ncommunity response in field conditions. In chapter III, the microcosm experiment showed that n-alkane \n\nremoval was enhanced in microcosms contaminated by chemically dispersed oil. However, the ultimate \n\nfate of this hydrocarbons is uncertain. Oil hydrocarbons may have moved from the sediments to the \n\nwater column by desorption and purged out from the microcosms during the simulated low tides or \n\nmoved to deeper layers of the sediment by percolation. This is relevant to the prediction of the overall \n\neffects since the dispersants may facilitate the transfer of oil hydrocarbon into subsurface sediments, \n\nwhere anaerobic conditions will substantially stall biodegradation and potentially perpetuate the presence \n\nof oil in the environment. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nLiterature Cited \n\n\n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\nLiterature Cited \n\n1.
