The hypothesis is that the revolutionary biomineralisation will recover the \n\nbiomechanical properties, remineralise and increase the longevity of the bonded interfaces. \n\nIn the chapter 1 was designed to qualitatively compare the presence of phosphate and \n\ncarbonated apatite between demineralized dentin samples and experimental composite \n\n(VSG1- 0% phosphate, VSG2- 10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% phosphate e VSG4- 30% \n\nphosphate) storage in distilled water and PBS solution in 24h, 7 days, 1 e 3 months. The \n\nsamples were analyzed by (ATR/FTIR) and (ESEM/EDX). Data were subjected to variance \n\nanalysis with three factors and Tukey (? = 0.05). The results showed that in 24 hours the \n\nhigher peak related the bands of carbonated apatite (CO3\n2-\n\n - v2), phosphate (PO4\n3-\n\n - v1,v3) \n\nand brushite (DCPD- vO-H) was found to the experimental material VSG2 (distilled water) \n\nand VSG3 (PBS). After 7 days, these same peaks suffered a drop therefore having an \n\nincreased peak to control group VSG1 (distilled water), VSG2 (PBS) and VSG4 (PBS) \n\ngroups. At 1 month , the material VSG2 (PBS) showed an increase in their peak, on the \n\nother hand VSG4 group (PBS solution) was maintained as compared to results 7 days and \n\nafter 3 months, was an increase in the peaks to VSG3 materials (distilled water) and control \n\ngroup (VSG1) in PBS solution. The EDX analysis showed no statistical difference between \n\nthe groups over time. In the chapter 2, the objective was to evaluate the influence of \n\ncalcium phosphate as a filler in experimental composite and their correlation with the \n\ndegree of conversion, microhardness, flexural resistance and elastic modulus. The \n\nexperimental material VSG4 showed higher hardness values after 6 months and higher \n\ndegree of conversion at 3 months and 6 months. Further flexural strength values were found \n\nfor the experimental material VSG2 well as the commercial material Wave HV (SDI). \n\nHigher elasticity modulus was obtained for the experimental material VSG4, similar values \n\nto the commercial Filtek Supreme (Z350XT- 3M/ESPE). Thus, it can be concluded that the \n\nuse of calcium phosphate did not affect the mechanical properties after storage in PBS \n\n\n\n  viii  \n \n\nsolution. In the chapter 3, the aim was evaluated by confocal microscopy and optcial \n\nmicroscopy the micropermeability by fluorescein dye penetration and the  nanoleakage by \n\nammoniacal silver nitrate as well as the adhesive strength over 24h and 6 months in buffer \n\nsolution (PBS) by microtensile test. Data on microtensile test were subjected to variance \n\nanalysis with two factors and Tukey (? = 0.05). The results showed that the bond strength \n\nwas not statistically different between the experimental groups. The calcium phosphate \n\ninclusion as filler particles and the use of tri-sodium metaphosphate aided in the \n\nremineralization process mainly to the experimental material VSG3 and VSG4 which \n\nshowed better micropermeability and  nanoleakage reducing dentin permeability after 6 \n\nmonths. \n\nKeywords: Flowable composite.

A hip\u00f3tese desse trabalho \n\nfoi de que a inovadora metodologia ir\u00e1 recuperar as propriedades mec\u00e2nicas, remineralizar\u00e1 \n\ne aumentar\u00e1 a longevidade da interface de uni\u00e3o. No Cap\u00edtulo 1 foi realizado an\u00e1lise \n\nqualitativa em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de fosfato e apatita carbonata nas amostras de dentina \n\ndesmineralizada e ap\u00f3s contato com os comp\u00f3sitos experimentais (VSG1- 0% fosfato, \n\nVSG2- 10% fosfato, VSG3- 20% fosfato e VSG4- 30% fosfato) armazenados em \u00e1gua \n\ndestilada e solu\u00e7\u00e3o de PBS no per\u00edodo de 24h, 7 dias, 1 e 3 meses. As amostras foram \n\nanalisadas por espectroscopia (ATR / FTIR) e an\u00e1lise microsc\u00f3pica (ESEM / EDX). Os \n\ndados foram submetidos \u00e0 an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia de tr\u00eas fatores e teste de Tukey (?=0.05). \n\nEm 24h os maiores picos referentes \u00e0s bandas de apatita carbonatada (CO3\n2-\n\n - v2) fosfato \n\n(PO4\n3-\n\n - v1,v3) e bruxita (DCPD- vO-H) foram para os grupos VSG2 (\u00e1gua destilada) e \n\nVSG3 (PBS). Em 7 dias esses picos diminuiram e ocorreu aumento dos picos para os \n\ngrupos VSG1 (\u00e1gua destilada), VSG2 (PBS) e VSG4 (PBS). Ap\u00f3s 1 m\u00eas, o material VSG2 \n\n(PBS) apresentou aumento do pico, por outro lado o grupo VSG4 (PBS) manteve-se similar \n\nao do per\u00edodo de 7 dias. Aos 3 meses, nota-se aumento para o material VSG3 (\u00e1gua \n\ndestilada) e grupo controle (VSG1) em PBS. A an\u00e1lise em EDX n\u00e3o mostrou diferen\u00e7a \n\nestat\u00edstica entre os grupos no decorrer do tempo.  No Cap\u00edtulo 2, o objetivo foi avaliar a \n\ninflu\u00eancia de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio como part\u00edculas de carga em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao grau de convers\u00e3o, \n\ndureza, resist\u00eancia flexural e m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico. O material experimental VSG4 mostrou \n\nmaiores valores de dureza ap\u00f3s 6 meses e maior grau de convers\u00e3o  nos per\u00edodos de 3 \n\nmeses e 6 meses. Maiores valores de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 flex\u00e3o foram encontrados para o material \n\nexperimental  VSG2 bem como para o material comercial Wave HV (SDI). Maior m\u00f3dulo \n\nde elasticidade foi obtido para o material VSG4, valores estes similares aos obtidos para o \n\nmaterial comercial Filtek Z350XT (3M/ESPE). Assim, pode-se concluir que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfosfatos de c\u00e1lcio n\u00e3o afetou as propriedades mec\u00e2nicas ap\u00f3s envelhecimento em solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde PBS. No Cap\u00edtulo 3, o objetivo foi avaliar por microscopia de confocal e microscopia \n\n\u00f3ptica a micropermeabilidade por penetra\u00e7\u00e3o de corante fluoresce\u00edna e nanoinfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\n\n\n  x  \n \n\nnitrato de prata amoniacal na camada h\u00edbrida assim como a resist\u00eancia adesiva nos per\u00edodos \n\nde 24 h e 6 meses em solu\u00e7\u00e3o de PBS. Os dados referentes ao teste de uni\u00e3o foram \n\nsubmetidos \u00e0 an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia de dois fatores e teste de Tukey (?=0.05). Os resultados \n\nmostraram que em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 resist\u00eancia adesiva n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica entre os \n\ngrupos e per\u00edodo de armazenamento. A inclus\u00e3o de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio e o uso de tri-\n\nmetafosfato de s\u00f3dio auxiliaram no processo de remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o para o material \n\nexperimental VSG3 e VSG4 os quais mostraram melhores resultados, reduzindo a \n\npermeabilidade dentin\u00e1ria ap\u00f3s 6 meses. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Comp\u00f3sito Flu\u00eddo.

Embora o exato mecanismo de deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o da interface \n\nadesiva ainda n\u00e3o seja totalmente conhecido, sabe-se que seus componentes est\u00e3o sujeitos \n\naos efeitos delet\u00e9rios da presen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua circulante na interface (degrada\u00e7\u00e3o hidrol\u00edtica) e \n\nda a\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas proteol\u00edticas (6). \n\nA degrada\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica pode ser mediada por um grupo de enzimas que \n\nrepresentam uma fam\u00edlia de endopeptidases capazes de degradar componentes da matriz \n\nextracelular denominadas de metaloproteinases da matriz dentin\u00e1ria (MMPs). Essas \n\nhidrolases atuam nas fibrilas de col\u00e1geno expostas na base da camada h\u00edbrida devido a \n\ndiscrep\u00e2ncia entre a profundidade de desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cida da dentina e a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmonom\u00e9rica durante os procedimentos adesivos (7-9), ou ainda devido \u00e0 lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncomponentes polim\u00e9ricos resinosos em longo prazo, que ocorre como resultado da \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o hidrol\u00edtica (10). \n\nFibrilas de col\u00e1geno permanecem expostas ap\u00f3s a uni\u00e3o resina-dentina devido \u00e0 \n\nincompleta infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o da dentina desmineralizada pelos mon\u00f4meros resinosos (11). Isso \n\nocorre como resultado conjunto de uma s\u00e9rie de fatores tais como a redu\u00e7\u00e3o gradual dos \n\nespa\u00e7os interfibrilares no sentido da dentina mineralizada, o alto peso molecular e menor \n\nhidrofilia de alguns mon\u00f4meros resinosos presentes nos adesivos dentin\u00e1rios (12, 13) e o \n\ngradiente de umidade da dentina (14) o que permite a ocorr\u00eancia da separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases (13).  \n\nUma maior exposi\u00e7\u00e3o desse col\u00e1geno na base da camada h\u00edbrida tem sido \n\ndemonstrada nas interfaces produzidas sobre dentina afetada por c\u00e1rie (15). Isso ocorre \n\ndevido \u00e0 menor mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o e maior porosidade da dentina intertubular no substrato \n\nafetado por c\u00e1rie, o que favorece a difus\u00e3o do agente \u00e1cido e, consequentemente, uma \n\ndesmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o mais profunda (15). \n\nA fim de restaurar esse equil\u00edbrio e reverter a desmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um \n\nrefor\u00e7o de remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. A remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser conseguida por meio do \n\ncrescimento epitaxial de cristais minerais residuais (matriz org\u00e2nica) das les\u00f5es \n\ndesmineralizadas (16, 17). \n\nDevido \u00e0 perda mineral e diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da integridade de uni\u00e3o das interfaces, a \n\nprocura por m\u00e9todos terap\u00eauticos inovadores para repara\u00e7\u00e3o da dentina cariada \u00e9 crescente \n\n\n\n  2  \n \n\n(18, 19). Tem sido confirmado (20) (21)  que a libera\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00edons a partir de materiais \n\nrestauradores \n\npode induzir a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de minerais para dentro da interface de dentina, favorecendo a \n\nrepara\u00e7\u00e3o tecidual.  \n\nIdealmente, a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da biofuncionalidade mec\u00e2nica da dentina \n\ndesmineralizada s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel devido \u00e0 remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do col\u00e1geno a n\u00edvel intra-fibrilar; se \n\nesta condi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o for preenchida o processo deve ser considerado incompleto (20, 22).  \n\nA dentina desmineralizada sofre degrada\u00e7\u00e3o (principalmente pelo col\u00e1geno do tipo \n\nI) pela libera\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos pela ativa\u00e7\u00e3o das enzimas end\u00f3genas colagenol\u00edticas (MMPs: \n\nmetalloproteinases da matriz dent\u00edn\u00e1ria) e estas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o completamente inibidas ou \n\nfossilizadas (18). \n\nUm artigo publicado recentemente (23) demonstrou que materiais a base de resina \n\ncontendo vidros bioativos podem aumentar a durabilidade de uni\u00e3o na interface adesiva \n\natrav\u00e9s do efeito de prote\u00e7\u00e3o terap\u00eautica associados com a remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da interface.  \n\nUma boa parte das pesquisas atuais em biomateriais para uso em Odontologia \n\nobjetiva a diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o e a modifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos materiais dent\u00e1rios existentes. Um aspecto \n\nfundamental \u00e9 a estabilidade destes materiais em longo prazo e a alternativa \u00e9 minimizar a \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o (24, 25). \n\nDentre os materiais bioativos est\u00e3o os fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio que t\u00eam despertado grande \n\ninteresse e motivo de diversas pesquisas na \u00e1rea (26) (24, 25). As combina\u00e7\u00f5es de CaP \n\npodem estar organizados em v\u00e1rias fases distintas, tais como: fosfato de c\u00e1lcio dib\u00e1sico \n\nanidro (CaHPO4- DCP); fosfato de c\u00e1lcio dib\u00e1sico diidratado (CaHPO4. H2O- DCPD); \n\nfosfato de c\u00e1lcio trib\u00e1sico ou fosfato tric\u00e1lcico [Ca3(PO4)2- TCP]; fosfato de c\u00e1lcio amorfo \n\n[Ca3(PO4)2?H2O- ACP]; fosfato octac\u00e1lcio [Ca8H2(PO4)6H2O- OCP]; fosfato tetrac\u00e1lcico \n\n[Ca4O(PO4)2- TeCP]; fosfato monoc\u00e1lcio mono-hidrato [Ca(H2PO4)2.H20- MCPM]; HA \n\n[Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2- (hidroxiapatita)] e fluorapatita ou apatita FA [Ca5(PO4)3F].  \n\nAlguns CaP como ?TCP s\u00e3o considerados absorv\u00edveis, isto \u00e9, dissolvem sob \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas e a vantagem disto \u00e9 que eles podem ser usados como biomateriais \n\npara serem assimilados pelo organismo (27, 28). \n\nO objetivo deste trabalho foi gerar uma metodologia restauradora baseada em bio-\n\nremineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, por meio de um material restaurador fotopolimeriz\u00e1vel (comp\u00f3sito \n\n\n\n  3  \n \n\nresinoso flu\u00eddo) com fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio bioativos e incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de metafosfatos (tri-\n\nmetafosfato de s\u00f3dio e \u00e1cido poliacr\u00edlico) em primer autocondicionante para auto-produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde fosfoprote\u00edna biomineralizadora da matriz de col\u00e1geno dentro da interface de uni\u00e3o. \n\nA hip\u00f3tese do estudo foi de que a nova metodologia iria recuperar as propriedades \n\nbiomec\u00e2nicas e remineralizaria a dentina justaposta \u00e0 interface de uni\u00e3o.

Introduction \n\n \n\nSeveral studies have been aimed at reincorporating mineral into demineralized dentin \n\n(1-4) by inclusion of CaP powder as a filler phase in bioactive polymer composites (5-10). \n\nIn these preventive or restorative dental materials, CaP is encapsulated in a polymer binder, \n\nand is capable of slowly releasing, in aqueous environments, substantial amounts of \n\ncalcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner through the transition to apatitic phases \n\n(6, 7) where the polymer resin serves to slow down the transition, as well as providing the \n\nmechanical integrity of the composite material. These composites have been shown to \n\npromote the recovery of mineral deficient tooth structure in vitro (11). The bioactivity of \n\nthese materials originates from the propensity of CaP, once exposed to oral fluids with \n\nfluctuating pH, which include those with acidic low pH, to release calcium and phosphate \n\nions in a sustained manner while spontaneously converting to thermodynamically stable \n\napatitic structures, such as HA (11).  \n\nMost of these studies focused on conventional remineralization that is based on the \n\nreincorporation of mineral (apatite) in dental tissues (dentin or enamel) by the use of \n\ncalcium and phosphate ion-containing solution in presence of various concentrations of \n\nfluoride (12, 13). Such a remineralization does not rely on spontaneous nucleation of \n\nmineral on the organic matrix but rather on epitaxial growth of residual apatite seed \n\ncrystallites in the partially demineralized dentin (14-17). Thus, only those parts of a \n\ncollagen matrix where remnant seed crystallites are present and abundant can be effectively \n\nremineralized, such as the basal part of a carious lesion (29).  In this regard, the use of \n\nconventional remineralization strategies that do not utilize biomimetic analogs is \n\nreasonably successful.  \n\nThe guide tissue remineralization (GTR) represents a novel strategy in collagen \n\nbiomineralization. This strategy utilizes nanotechnology and biomimetic principles to \n\nachieve intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar remineralization of a collagen matrix in the abscence \n\nof apatite seed crystalittes (18-20). In this strategy, two polyanionic analogs (polyacrylic \n\n\n\n  7  \n \n\nacid or polyaspartic acid) are involved to mimic the sequestration and templating functions \n\nof matrix proteins in biomineralization. Dentin is a mineralized collagenous tissue formed \n\nby matrix-mediated mechanisms. Inorganic polyphosphates play an important role in \n\nguiding the nucleation and growth of apatite within the gap zones of collagen fibrils during \n\nbiomineralization (21). \n\nThe current study was designed to qualitatively compare the presence of phosphate and \n\ncarbonated apatite peaks between demineralized dentin and experimental flowable \n\ncomposite samples (VSG1-0% phosphate, VSG2-10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% phosphate \n\nand VSG4-30% phosphate) thereby checking the remineralization ability using Attenuated \n\nTotal Reflection by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR/FTIR) and Scanning \n\nElectron Microscopy-Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis (ESEM/EDX) was used to analyse \n\nthe chemical changes to the interface dentin-composite.  \n\nThe hypothesis that the calcium-phosphate would not induce a remineralization and the \n\nESEM-EDX analysis of the interface resin-dentin not revealed the presence of calcium and \n\nphosphate elements. \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1 Composite formulations  \n\n \n\nFour experimental composite flow (named VSG1, VSG2, VSG3, VSG4) were \n\ntested in this study. The resin matrix for all formulations can be showed in Table 1. Each \n\nexperimental composite was loaded with MCPM [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP [Fluka, Germany] \n\nand Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2). Each group had received a specific \n\nphosphate concentration to which was added Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, Joinvile, SC, \n\nBrazil) (Tab. 3). The materials were prepared by mixing powder (phosphate and silicate \n\nglass) with the resin matrix to form a homogeneous paste. \n\n2.2 Dentin Remineralization tests (DRT): ATR/FTIR vibrational of the \n\nbioactivity \n\n \n\nThe DRT was performed according to a protocol previously described Gandolfi et \n\nal., (2011) (22),  human dentin slices  (5\u00b10.2 mm and 0.8 \u00b10.1mm thick)  from  40 molar \n\n\n\n  8  \n \n\nteeth  (n=10 per group) were prepared and demineralized in EDTA 17% for 2 hours at room \n\ntemperature (Fig 1). \n\nDisks of set materials (8 mm diameter and 1.6 mm thick) were prepared using a \n\nteflon molds. Each material disk (n=10 per group) was maintained in close contact with a \n\ndemineralized dentin slice using an orthodontic elastic and 5 slices of each group soaked in \n\n15 mL PBS solution in the refrigerator, and  5 slices of each group soaked in 15 mL \n\ndistillate water at 37\u00b0C, during 24h, 7 days, 1 and 3 months (Fig. 1). \n\nThe PBS solution (pH of 7.4) it is a saline solution containing sodium chloride and \n\nsodium phosphate. Acid-base buffers are intended to maintain a substantially constant pH \n\nvalue, when added to different means.  The salt concentration present in PBS is the same \n\nthe human body (isotonic). \n\nAfter this time, the dentin slice was removed from the material disk, rinsed with \n\ndeionized water (samples soaked in PBS solution) and them analyzed in dry conditions \n\n(excess of water totally removed by 30 min. in the oven) by ATR-FTIR Spectrometer \n\n(Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer), equipped with a Smart Orbit diamond attenuated total \n\nreflectante (ATR) accessory and a DTGS detector (Fig.1).  \n\n The spectral resolution was 4 cm\n-1\n\n and 64 number of scans for each spectrum in the \n\nregion of 650-4000 cm\n-1\n\n. The ATR area had a 2 mm diameter and the IR irradiation \n\npenetration was approximately 3-5 \u00b5m. In order to place the specimens in contact with the \n\nATR crystal, a pressure was applied (5psi) during the measurement. Each specimen was \n\nanalysed in three different positions (the sample medium, up and down) before the contact \n\nwith the material disks (demineralized sample) and after contact the material disks. \n\nThe spectrum acquired at the end of the analyses represented the average of all the \n\nthree single scans. Spectra of water was obtained and subtracted from each of the original \n\nspectra, which were then processed by smoothing, baseline corrected, and normalized to the \n\namide I peak (23). The mineral matrix radio (the radio of integrated areas of the phosphate \n\nv1, v3 contour to the amide I peak, carbonated apatite- v2, and v-OH, DCPD peaks) was \n\nmeasured qualitatively in all spectra. The crystal of DCPD peaks appear at 3527, 3468, \n\n3273 and 3171 cm\n?1\n\n bands were due to ?O\u2013H vibration modes of the water in brushite. \n\n In addition, ATR-FTIR spectra from the commercial high purity (>97%) \n\nhydroxyapatite (Sigma-Aldrich) powder were also obtained to characterize their chemical \n\n\n\n  9  \n \n\nstructures. The untreated dentin slice and after demineralization were analyzed for \n\ncomparison in relation to peaks position as comparison with the experimental material \n\nwithout phosphate (VSG1- control group). \n\n \n\n2.3 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-\n\nray analysis (ESEM-EDX) \n\n \n\n24 molar teeth (n=6) was used to ESEM-EDX. The coronal dentin specimens (n=3 per \n\ngroup) were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath the cement-enamel junction \n\n(CEJ), using a hard tissue microtome (Isomet 11/180; Buehler, Coventry, UK) equipped \n\nwith a diamond embedded blade (XL-12205; Benetec, London, UK). The smear layer-\n\ncovered middle coronal dentin was exposed by a polishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC \n\npaper for 1 min. under continuous water irrigation. The specimens were divided into four \n\nexperimental groups, according to Table 3 and the etching procedures were performed by \n\nself-etching primer (Table 4).  \n\nThe self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared surfaces dentin with \n\nmicrobrush and solvent evaporated with a gentle steam air for 10 seconds. The \n\nexperimental flowable composites were used to build-up (3 layers \u2013 1mm each). Each \n\ncomposite layer was light-cured for 20s, using a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp (Optilux-\n\n501; Kerr) and the last coat was light-cured for 40s. \n\nAfter 24h and 6 months PBS solution storage, the resin-bonded specimens from each \n\ngroup were sectioned using a hard tissue microtome (Buehler, UK) in both x and y \n\ndirections across the bonding interface obtaining beams with cross-sectional areas of 0.9 \n\nmm\n2\n. Three representative beams were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (ESEM-\n\nEDX) to analyse the chemical changes to the interface dentin-composite. The beams were \n\nmounted on aluminum stubs, coated with carbon (Balzers SCD 050 sputter coater, B.U.A. \n\nCo., F\u00fcrstentum, Germany) and examined by Environmental Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscopy (ESEM, JSM-5600LV-JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), operated an accelerating voltage \n\nof 20-25kV. Each specimen was analysed in five different positions (in the material and \n\nfour position in the interface) showing the relation the Ca/P in each position. \n\n \n\n\n\n  10  \n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 FTIR spectroscopic analyses \n\nDemineralized dentin (Fig. 2- blue line): FTIR analysis confirmed that the use \n\nEDTA treatment was able to remove the mineral phase recorded in the region of 885-1180 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n and showed bands representing collagen (Amide I) in the region 1700-1600 cm\n-1 \n\n(22). \n\nThe spectral features typical of the apatite component were no longer observed.  \n\nDentin surface (Fig. 3- green line): FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of the \n\nmineral phase in the region of 885-1180 cm\n-1\n\n and lower peaks of bands representing \n\ncollagen (Amide I) in the region 1700-1600 cm\n-1\n\n [50] in comparison of the demineralized \n\ndentin.

(Fig. 4a, 4b, \n\n4c and 4d): The crystal of DCPD peaks appear at 3527, 3468, 3273 and 3171 cm\n?1\n\n bands \n\nwere due to ?O\u2013H vibration modes for all groups. Spectra recorded in the region of 873-\n\n880 cm\n-1\n\n , 1410-1412 cm\n-1\n\n 1010-1035 cm\n-1\n\n  and 1465 cm\n-1\n\n characteristic bands for \n\ncarbonate (v2; out-of-plane bend vibration) and (v3; asymmetric stretch vibration) (24). \n\n3.2 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-\n\nray analysis (ESEM-EDX) \n\nThe ESEM-EDX analysis of the dentin untreated surface (Fig. 5b) and completely \n\ndemineralized dentin (Fig. 5a) showed traces of calcium phosphate and the presence of the \n\ncarbon and oxygen peak. The EDX depth profile on demineralized dentin sections proved \n\nthat the treatment used (EDTA 17%, 2h) removed the mineral phase of dentin to 80\u00b5m \n\ndepth. Actually, Ca and P peaks were observed in lower peaks, suggesting that the water \n\nand collagen were left in place.  \n\n\n\n  11  \n \n\nThe ESEM-EDX analysis for the four experimental flowable composites (VSG1 \n\ncontrol group, VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4), soaked in PBS solution during 24h and 6 months, \n\nin relation the CA/P (mean and SDs) are shown in Table 5. Results were analysed with \n\ntwo-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test (p?0.05). \n\n Interactions between Ca/P were no significant (p ?0.05). Material and PBS solution \n\nstorage time (24h and 6 months) no influenced the CA/P results (p?0.01).  \n\nThe ESEM-EDX analysis for experimental flowable composite (VSG1, VSG2, \n\nVSG3 and VSG4) soaked in PBS solution during 24h (Fig 6a,7a, 8a, 9a) and after 6 months \n\n(Fig. 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b) showed the presence of calcium phosphate deposits (Ca/P- 2.17 [24h], \n\n1.27- [6m]),  (Ca/P- 2.25 [24h], 1.98- [6m]), (Ca/P- 2.10 [24h], 2.72- [6m]), (Ca/P- 2.26 \n\n[24h], 1.66- [6m]) on the dentin interface surface. \n\n4. Discussion \n\nThe hypothesis that calcium-phosphate (MCPM and ?-TCP) in the experimental \n\nflowable composite in contact with demineralized dentin surfaces not induce a \n\nremineralization (e.g. phosphate, carbonated apatite peaks and DCPD peaks) was rejected. \n\nThe experimental flowable composites induced an apatite formation as showed by presence \n\nof phosphate bands at 1035cm\n-1\n\n,1180cm\n-1\n\n, 1545-1450cm\n-1\n\n assigned to the phosphate v1, v3 \n\n(PO4\n3-\n\n) and carbonated apatite (v2) (CO3\n2-\n\n) by presence of  bands at 873-880cm\n-1\n\n, 1412-\n\n1465cm\n-1\n\n, 1000-1100cm\n-1\n\n representative of mineral components (Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d). These \n\nbands appeared over time independent of the storage and the phosphate concentration for \n\neach group experimental  indicating a sign of dentin remineralization which can be \n\ncompared with the demineralized dentin sample which showed collagen bands by the \n\npresence of amide bands from 1725 cm\n-1\n\n that proving the removing of mineral phase.The \n\ncrystal of DCPD peaks appear at 3527, 3468, 3273 and 3171 cm\n?1\n\n bands were due to ?O\u2013H \n\nvibration modes of the water in brushite (25).  \n\nThe FTIR spectra of the carbonate apatite are dominated by a complex band at about \n\n1000-1100 cm\n-1\n\n for the asymmetric stretch vibration of the phosphate group. The \n\ncharacteristic bands for carbonate occur in the spectra regions 1400-1600 cm\n-1\n\n (v3; \n\nasymmetric stretch vibration) and 873-880 cm\n-1\n\n (v2; out-of-plane bend vibration) (44). \n\nEarlier study on natural and synthetic HA (26) found that type A carbonate was \n\n\n\n  12  \n \n\ncharacterised by a doublet band at about 1545 and 1450 cm\n-1\n\n (v3) and a single band at about \n\n878 cm-1 (v2), whereas type B carbonate has these bands at about 1455, 1410 and 871 cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nWhen compared the samples soaked in distilled water and PBS solution during 24h, \n\nwas observed an increase in phosphate and carbonate apatite peak for (VSG2-distilled \n\nwater) and (VSG3- PBS solution). After 7 days, the same group showed a decrease in these \n\npeaks. However, the (VSG1- distilled water), (VSG2- PBS solution) and (VSG4- PBS \n\nsolution) had an increase in these peaks. At 1 month of storage, only the groups (VSG2- \n\nPBS solution) and (VSG4- PBS solution) had an increase in their peaks and after 3 months \n\n(VSG3-distilled water), (VSG4- PBS solution) and (VSG1-PBS solution) showed an \n\nincreased peak. In 3 months, there was an increase in these peaks for the material VSG3 \n\nstored in distillate water and decreased during the same period prescribed when stored in \n\nPBS solution. The crystal of DCPD peaks (?O\u2013H vibration modes) was observed in all \n\ngroups during the proposed time, both soaked in distilled water as PBS solution. \n\nThe CaP used as filler in restorative dental materials  is encapsulated in a polymer \n\nbinder, and is capable of slowly releasing, in aqueous environments, substantial amounts of \n\ncalcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner through the transition to apatitic phases \n\n(7, 19) where the polymer resin serves to slow down the transition, as well as providing the \n\nmechanical integrity of the composite material. These composites have been shown to \n\npromote the recovery of mineral deficient tooth structure in vitro (11). The bioactivity of \n\nthese materials originates from the propensity of CaP, once exposed to oral fluids with \n\nfluctuating pH, which include those with acidic low pH, to release calcium and phosphate \n\nions in a sustained manner while spontaneously converting to thermodynamically stable \n\napatitic structures (11). The MCPM and ?TCP powder (CaP) which in contact with the \n\nwater (oral fluids) react and form dicalcium phosphate dihydrate crystals [DCPD- brushite]. \n\nIt is well known that precipitated Ca-P phases in aqueous solutions mainly include \n\ndicalcium phosphate [CaHPO4.2H2O, DCPD], octacalcium phosphate \n\n[Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4. 5H2O, OCP] and hydroxyapatite [Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6, HA]. \n\nExperimental studies of Ca-P formation in simulated physiological environments have \n\nnot clearly indicated the conditions to forming specific Ca-P phases. Some investigations \n\nhave been demonstrated their stability at low pH (<4.2) (8, 9, 46, 47) or possible when \n\n\n\n  13  \n \n\nimmersed in a calcium-ion saturated solution and through pH increase (46). According \n\nXiong et al., (2005) the free energy changes of Ca-P precipitation and the Ca-P nucleations \n\nrates in aqueous solutions (i.e, simulated body fluid) are presented for a range of pH values. \n\nHowever, there is no thermodynamic driving force for the DCPD precipitation over the \n\nentire pH range. The PBS solution is composed by sodium chloride and sodium phosphate \n\nthus, the environment gets supersaturated with ions which induces the precipitation stage \n\nand the apatite nucleation.  This  explains  the  presence of   apatite carbonated bands (v2) \n\nand  phosphate bands (v1, v3)  in the experimental group (VSG1- 0% phosphate) at 7 days \n\nand 3 months, once that this group not have phosphate in their composition. \n\nVarious methods have been used for evaluating the effectiveness of the remineralization \n\nprocedure in dental tissues. Recent studies have assessed the reincorporation of mineral into \n\ndemineralized dentin using indirect qualitative analysis, such as, polarized light microscopy \n\n(27) and semiquantitative analysis such as transverse microradiography (28). Transmission \n\nElectron Microscopy (TEM) (20) and spectroscopic analyses, such as Raman and Fourier \n\ntransform infrared spectroscopy was also assessed (13, 29).  In polarized light microscopy \n\nanalyses, the quantitative relationship between changes in mineral content and \n\nbirefringence has not been established. In the present study, IR spectroscopy in the \n\nATR/FTIR technique has been used for non-destructively  analysis to verify the efficiency \n\nof the demineralization procedure as well as the extent of the remineralization process. The \n\nsame technique has been used to characterize the composition changes on the surface of the \n\ncement disks aged in PBS solution (22). \n\nOne way of classify the calcium phosphate is through molar ratio \n\ncalcium/phosphorus atoms (Ca/P ratio). According to the ESEM-EDX analysis for \n\nexperimental flowable composites (VSG1, VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) soaked in PBS \n\nsolution during 24h and 6 months, the presence of calcium phosphate deposits on the dentin \n\ninterface not showed statisticaly difference between the groups.   \n\nThe ESEM-EDX characterization capabilities are due in large part to the basic \n\nprinciple that each element has a unique atomic structure X-ray emission spectrum, \n\nallowing unique set of peaks on its (30). The apatite crystals of the carbonated apatite is \n\nsimilar to the mineral hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, but inclusions carbonate, sodium \n\nfluoride, magnesium, potassium, iron and other ion are impure form of biological apatite. \n\n\n\n  14  \n \n\nThese minerals correspond the 80%-90% of apatite carbonated (26, 31, 32). So, the \n\ncarbonated hydroxyapatite form could be chemically represented by the formula: (Ca, Mg, \n\nNa, x) 10 (PO4, HPO4 (CO3)6 (OH, CI) 2 where X is the inclusion of other ions (26, 31, 32). \n\nThus, if is compared the Ca amount by this molecule in both forms is noted that the HA has \n\n60 Ca-atoms compared with 10 Ca-atoms in apatite carbonated. Thus, if it relates the \n\npresence of Ca/P in the interface (remineralized area) according to data obtained, it \n\nsuggests that the number of these elements were the same, without difference between \n\ngroups and times (once that was used different phosphates concentrations), which could \n\nlead to one difference in remineralization procedure, favouring different action of these \n\nelements in the nucleation process. \n\nAlthough there was no statistical difference, studies report Aoki, 1991 (33) that the \n\nDCPD (dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate) molar ratio is 1.0, and hydroxyapatite (HA) is \n\n1.67. According to the data obtained in our studies, the experimental group VSG4 after 6 \n\nmonths storage in PBS solution showed molar ratio Ca/P of 1.66, suggesting the formation \n\nof hydroxyapatite. \n\nIn this methodology, two biomimetic analogs were used (polyacrylic acid and \n\nsodium trimetaphosphate). During calcium phosphate biomineralization, calcium and \n\nphosphate ions are sequesteredy by biomimetic analogs of non-collagenous proteins \n\ninvolved in hard tissue mineralization into nanoparticles that exist in nanoscopical units \n\nknown as prenucleation clusters(34, 35). These prenucleation clusters (~1nm in diameter) \n\neventually aggregate into larger (10-50nm in diameter) liquid-like CaP nanoparticles. The \n\nlatter, on penetration into the intrafibrillar water compartments of a collagen fibril, utilize \n\nthe latter as a mineralization template, and undergo self-assembly and crystallographic \n\nalignment to form a metastable crystalline phase via mesoscale assembly. These \n\nmesocrystals probably fused to form iso-oriented crystal intermediates, and finally to single \n\napatite crystallites within the 40nm wide gap zone between the collagen molecules (36, 37). \n\nThis ordered arrangement of apatite crystallites results in the manifestation of a banded \n\nappearance in unstained, mineralized fibrillar collagen (38). Thus, there is not only a \n\nremineralization mechanism but biomimetic analogs that would guide the \n\nbioremineralization, once that collagenous remineralization will occur by an assignment \n\n\n\n  15  \n \n\nnewly formed crystals, not containing a direct link with the fibrillar collagen (Dey et al., \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\n \n\n- The presence of calcium phosphate (MCPM and ?-TCP) in the experimental \n\nflowable composites in contact with the demineralized dentin induced the formation \n\nof hydroxyapatite crystals. \n\n- EDX analysis of the interface resin-dentin revealed the presence of calcium and \n\nphosphate elements but not showed statistically difference between the groups. \n\n \n\n6.

Introduction \n\n \n\n The longevity of posterior composite restorations remains a matter of concern among \n\ndentist. Surveys revealed that composite restorations placed in premolars and molars need to be \n\nreplaced after 5\u20136 years (1-3). The need for more durable restorations is one of the driving \n\nforces for the development of new materials and, though not always suitable for predicting \n\nclinical outcomes, laboratory evaluations are often used to estimate their potential by \n\ncomparison with already established commercial products (4). \n\nTherefore, it is highly desirable to develop a new class of composites that can combat \n\nrecurrent caries while sustaining the load-bearing capability (5-8). Recently developed calcium \n\nphosphate filled polymeric dental composites based on photocurable dental resins are capable of \n\nreleasing significant amounts of calcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner in aqueous \n\nmilieu (5, 9-13) (14). These bioactive composites are potentially effective anti-\n\ndemineralizing/remineralizing agents for the preservation and repair of teeth with foreseeable \n\napplications as dental restorative composites, adhesives, cements, protective liners and bases, \n\npit and fissure sealants and orthodontic bracket cements.  \n\nTo improve their mechanical properties while maintaining sustained release of Ca and \n\nPO4 ions, the researches have so far focused on: (a) synthesizing fillers with structurally \n\n\n\n  35  \n \n\nincorporated silica and/ or zirconia and (b) developing surface-modified hybrid fillers amenable \n\nto treatment by silane coupling agents (9, 14). \n\nThe improvement of the mechanical properties of bioactive composite materials has \n\nbeen a subject of extensive research for several years (15, 16). In the development of dental \n\ncomposites, Bowen, (1956, 1963) (17, 18) was the first who proved that the filler load plays an \n\nimportant role in increasing the modulus and strength of dental composite resins (17, 18). Later \n\nstudies confirmed that the volume fraction of the filler is positively correlated to the diametral \n\ntensile strength and hardness of commercial composite materials (19, 20). Besides, strong \n\ncovalent bond between the inorganic fillers and the organic matrix is considered to be essential \n\nfor obtaining good mechanical properties (21).  \n\nIt has been reported that stable filler/matrix bonds improve the distribution and \n\nstress transmission from the flexible resin matrix to the stiffer and stronger inorganic filler \n\nparticles (21). In contrast, ineffective silane coupling can result in an accelerated in vivo \n\ndegradation of dental composites (22). Unlike conventional composite materials, CaP fillers \n\ncannot be effectively silanized as this interferes with the calcium and phosphate ion release, \n\nwhich impairs the remineralizing properties while not providing a progress in mechanical \n\nproperties (14, 23-26). This is confirmed by an attempt to silanize similar calcium and \n\nphosphate releasing material, which increased the composites strength, but decreased the ion \n\nrelease (24-26).  \n\nSome studies have shown that the composite resins with calcium phosphate fillers \n\nare only useful for sealants (14, 27). One study used apatite particles combined with nanometer-\n\nscale silica whiskers as mixed filler in an attempt to overcome this loss of strength (14). These \n\nauthors found that the whiskered composite had substantially improved mechanical properties \n\nwhen compared to the reinforced fillers in the composite resins without whiskers (14, 27).  \n\nIn order to use these materials in clinical practice as a restorative material, it is \n\nnecessary to enhance the mechanical properties so that the material could withstand the \n\nmasticatory tension. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive \n\ncalcium phosphate (MCPM and ?TCP) as filler in experimental flowable composite and their \n\ncorrelation with the mechanical properties after aging. The hypothesis was that calcium \n\nphosphate used as a filler in experimental flowable composites interfere on the mechanical \n\nproperties. \n\n\n\n  36  \n \n\n \n\n2.

Each experimental composite was loaded with MCPM (Monocalcium \n\nphosphate monohydrate [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP (?-Tricalcium phosphate [Fluka, Germany] \n\nand Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2) (VSG1- 0wt% VSG2-10wt%, 20wt% and \n\nVSG3- VSG4-30wt%). After this, was added to this mixture Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, \n\nJoinvile, SC, Brazil) at a concentration of (VSG1- 50wt%, 40wt% VSG2-, VSG3- 30wt% \n\nand VSG4-20wt%) (Tab. 3); a resin blend was added in the end by 50wt% (Tab.1). The \n\nexperimental self-etching primer were obtained by adding: GDMA-P (20wt%)- hydrophilic \n\nmonomers functional acids, HEMA (10wt%), TEGDMA (10wt%), UDMA (15wt%), \n\nDistilled water (15wt%), Ethanol (20wt%), (0.5wt%)- Sodium trimetaphosphate and \n\n(0.5wt%)-  Polyacrilic acid. \n\n \n\n2.2 Sample preparation \n\n Sixteen third human molars were used in this study (n=2) under a protocol (ref. 150/2012) \n\napproved by an institutional. The teeth were stored in deionised water for 24h and 6 months. \n\nCoronal dentine specimens were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath the cement-\n\nenamel junction (CEJ). The smear layer-covered middle coronal dentine was exposed by \n\npolishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC paper for 1 minute under continuous water irrigation. \n\nThe specimens were divided into experimental groups according to Table 3. The bonded-dentin \n\nspecimens were submitted to a simulated pulpal pressure method (SPP) as previously described \n\n(Feitosa et al., 2012) (28, 29). The resin-bonded teeth were covered with two coats of nail \n\nvarnish at resin-enamel border to avoid water seepage through this margin; hence, the passage \n\nof water was possible only through dentinal tubules. The specimens were glued and positioned \n\nsideways on the lid of a cylindrical receptacle. The pulp chamber of each specimen and the \n\nreceptacle were filled with PBS solution, sealed and turned upside down. The samples had a \n\n20cm water column over them. The water pressure was maintained for 24h and 6 months.  \n\n\n\n  37  \n \n\n2.3 Dentine pre-treatment and bonding procedures \n\n \n\nThe self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared dentin surface with \n\nmicrobrush and solvent evaporated with compressed air for 10 seconds. The experimental \n\ncomposites were light cured for 20s (3 layers- 1mm) using a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp \n\n(Optilux-501; Kerr). The last coat was light-cured for 40s with 850 mW / cm\u00b2 light intensity. \n\n \n\n2.4 Knoop Hardness Analysis (KHN) \n\n \n\nThe resin-bonded specimens (N=16, n=2) were  longitudinally sectioned in 2mm-thick \n\nslabs (5 slices per teeth).The thick slabs were inserted into a polyvinylsiloxane mould and \n\nembedded in self-cure acrylic resin. The specimens were removed from the moulds and \n\npolished using #500, #1200, #2400 and #4000 grit SiC abrasive papers on an automated \n\npolisher (MetaServ 3000, Buehler) under water-cooling (30 s per abrasive papers). The \n\nspecimens were stored in PBS solution at 37\u00b0C for 24h and 6 months. The specimens were \n\ndried and submitted to Knoop hardness measurements in a hardness tester (Duramin-5, Struers \n\nA/S, DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark) using a 25gf load and 15s dwell time to produce \n\nindentations with a size suitable accurate measurements for minimising surface damage. The \n\nKnoop micro-hardness values (KHN: Kg/mm\n2\n) were recorded as the average of the three \n\nindentations executed in straight lines starting from the resin composite along four different \n\npositions (Fig. 1) of the dentine surface (interface, below interface, distance interface and hard \n\ntissue). The three measurements along each line were taken every 30\u00b5m up to 110\u00b5m in depth. \n\nFor each depth, three readings were taken and averaged to obtain a mean value (Kg.mm\n-1\n\n). For \n\neach slab was considered as a sample unit. Data were subjected to variance analysis with three \n\nfactors followed by Tukey\u2019s test (p?0.05). \n\n2.5 Degree of Conversion (DC) \n\n \n\nTwo commercially available flowable composites, one self-cure glass ionomer (GIC) \n\nalong with four experimental materials (flowable composite) were selected for this test: Filtek\nTM\n\n \n\nSupreme Flow (3M/ESPE), Wave HV (SDI), Riva self-cure HV (SDI), VSG1,VSG2, VSG3 \n\n\n\n  38  \n \n\nand VSG4. The composition of these materials is listed in Table 1, 2, 3 and 4. For each material \n\ncylindrical specimens (6mm diameter x 1 mm thickness) were built (N=126, n=3) using a \n\nTeflon mould. The composites were inserted and a Mylar strip was placed on top of the uncured \n\nmaterial. A glass slide was positioned on top of the Mylar strip. The halogen curing unit (850 \n\nmW/cm\n2\n, Optilux-501, Demetron Kerr, Orange, USA) was clamped directly over the window \n\nfilled with restorative material, and the tip of the curing unit was perpendicular to the surface of \n\nthe composites. The groups VSG1, VSG2, VSG3, VSG4, Wave HV and Filtek\nTM\n\n Supreme flow \n\nwere light-cured for 40s according by manufacturer. For the manipulation of the commercial \n\nmaterial  Riva self-cure HV (GIC) the capsule was activated by pushing the plunger, placed the \n\ncapsule in amalgamator Ultramat (4000-4800rpm)  for 10 seconds,removed the cap and placed \n\nit in Riva Applicator. The time working at 23\u00b0C was about 90 seconds (1'30 '') from the start of \n\nmixing.A small piece of the resin composite was placed between two polyethylene layers and \n\npressed to form a very thin film, and the absorbance peaks of the uncured samples were \n\nobtained. \n\nThe degree of conversion (DC) of the experimental and commercial materials was \n\nanalyzed using the Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer \n\n(Nicolet 5700, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The spectra were assessed before \n\nand subsequent to light-activation (40s; 1h, 24h, 1, 3 and 6 months). The specimens were stored \n\nin PBS solution at 37\u00b0C before testing. All spectra were obtained in a range of 1800-1500 cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nwith 64 scans at 4 cm\n-1\n\n resolution in transmission mode and 2.8 mm/s mirror speed. The \n\nresidual unreacted carbon-carbon double bond content (% C=C) was determined from the ratio \n\nof absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1637 cm\n-1\n\n) against an internal standard \n\n(aromatic carbon-carbon bond peak at 1608 cm\n-1\n\n) before and 40s after starting the light-\n\nactivation. The radio between the peak heights of the aliphatic (1638cm\n-1\n\n) and aromatic \n\n(1608cm\n-1\n\n) carbon double bond absorptions for the cured and uncured material was used to \n\ncalculate the DC according to the formula: DC= (1- polymerized/unpolymerized) x 100 \n\nPrior to the spectroscopy analysis, the specimens were rinsed with distilled water for 30s \n\nand then air dried and polished. Degree of conversion was determined by subtracting the C=C% \n\nfrom 100 %. Data were subjected to variance analysis with two factors followed by Tukey\u2019s test \n\n(p?0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n  39  \n \n\n2.6 Flexural modulus (FM) and Elastic modulus (EM) \n\n \n\nThe materials evaluated in this test were the same used to Degree of Conversion test. \n\nSpecimens were manufactured according to ISO 4049 using a Teflon mould (2 mm x 2 mm x 25 \n\nmm, N=70, n=10). Photoactivation was carried out with a halogen light-curing unit (850 \n\nmW/cm\n2\n, Optilux-501, Demetron Kerr, Orange, USA) on five overlapping spots of \u00d88mm (20s \n\neach) on both the upper and lower surfaces. Specimen edges were manually finished with #800, \n\n#1000-grif SiC paper. The specimens were stored in PBS solution at 37\u00b0C for 24h and 6 months. \n\nThe specimens were submitted to three-point bending testing in a universal testing machine \n\n(Instron 5565; Instron, Canton, MA, USA), with a 6-mm span between the supports at a \n\ncrosshead speed of 0.5mm min\n-1\n\n. The load at fracture and the specimen dimensions (determined \n\nindividually using a digital calliper) were used to calculated the FM, according the formula: FM= \n\n3 x L x D/ 2 x w x h\n2\n where: L is the load at fracture (N), D is the distance between the supports, \n\nw is the width, and h is the height of the specimen all in mm. The flexural modulus was \n\nmonitored by the software in a computer attached to the testing machine, which showed a tension \n\nx deformation graph that allowed obtaining the elastic modulus.  \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 Knoop Hardness Analysis (KHN) \n\nThe mean KHN values (Kg.mm\n-1\n\n) and the standard deviations are listed in Table 5. When \n\nwas analysed the hardness values between all groups during 24h and 6 months, the control group \n\n(VSG1) (interface region) had the highest hardness values (p?0.05) in 24h. Regarding the \n\nexperimental flowabe composite (VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) not showed statistically difference \n\nbetween 24h and 6 months comparing with the hardness values to interface region.  When \n\nanalysed the  composite region during 6 months all materials showed decrease values (p?0.05)  in \n\nrelation to 24h. The same was observed for the other depths (below the interface, far the interface \n\nand dentin). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  40  \n \n\n3.2 Degree of Conversion  \n\n \n\nTable 6 lists mean values and the SDs of percentage DC during 40s, 1h, 24h, 1, 3 and 6 \n\nmonths for each tested material. According to the DC values, the experimental group (VSG1) \n\nshowed statistically highest values during 1h and 40s, but not differed statistically after 1 month \n\nsoaked in PBS solution, remaining lower values when compared with other times. The same not \n\nhappened to 1h time showing decrease in values after 1m storage (p?0.05). There was no \n\nstatistical difference between the storage times to experimental groups (VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) \n\nand commercial material (Wave). \n\nThe commercial material (Filtek Supreme flow) showed statistically highest values during \n\nperiod 1h and 40s time. There was no statistical difference between the others storage times, \n\nalthough during 1h the DC values was considered greater. Highest values (p?0.05) were showed \n\nto the commercial material (Riva) when compared with other times, although not differed \n\nstatistically between them.   \n\nWhen was analysed the DC values between  all groups during  40s, the commercial \n\nmaterial (Riva and Filtek Supreme flow) and the experimental group (VSG4) showed highest \n\nvalues (p?0.05) in comparing to the material (VSG2,Wave and VSG1).The commercial \n\nmaterial (Wave) showed statistically lower values  between (VSG3, VSG4, Riva and Filtek \n\nSupreme flow). The same occurred in 24h, remaining the statistically lower values between \n\n(VSG1, VSG2, VSG4 and Filtek Supreme flow). The resin composite Filtek Supreme flow, \n\nVSG2 and VSG4 showed highest values (p?0.05) but not statistical difference between them. \n\nAt 1h, the commercial materials (Riva and Filtek Supreme flow) and the experimetnal group \n\n(VSG1) showed the highest values (p?0.05) without statistically difference between Riva and \n\nFiltek Supreme flow (p?0.05).  The commercial material (Wave) showed statistically lower \n\nvalues (p?0.05) between the others materials, without difference to VSG3. The same occurred \n\nin 1 month, remaining the statistically lower values between the Wave and (Riva, Filtek \n\nSupreme flow, VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4). The resin composite (Filtek Supreme flow) and \n\nexperimental material (VSG3) showed the highest values (p?0.05) in comparing to the other \n\ngroups. During 3 months and 6 months, the commercial material (Wave) showed the \n\nstatistically lower values  between the (Filtek Supreme flow and VSG4) that obtained the \n\nhighest values (p?0.05), in comparing to the other groups. \n\n\n\n  41  \n \n\n \n\n3.3 Flexural modulus (FM) and Elastic modulus (EM) \n\nThe means and SDs of flexural modulus (MPa) and elastic modulus (GPa) for each \n\ntested material are shown in Tables 8 and 9. According to the flexural strength data (Tab.7) the \n\ncomposite (Filtek Supreme flow) and the flowable resin composite (Wave) had the highest \n\nvalues in 24h, not statistically difference between them. Regarding the experimental flowable \n\ncomposite (VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) showed statistically lower values comparing with the \n\ncontrol group (VSG1), followed by the Riva material (self-cure glass ionomer cement). At 3 \n\nmonths, the composite (Riva) showed a smaller result statistically different from the other \n\nmaterials. There was no statistical difference between both groups except for experimental \n\nflowable composite (VSG4) that showed statistically lower results. During six months the \n\ncontrol group (VSG1) had the highest value without differ statistically from the experimental \n\nflowabe composite (VSG2) and flowable composite (Wave) (p?0.05) which did not differ \n\nfrom the composite (Filtek Z350XT). The experimental flowable composites (VSG3 and \n\nVSG4) did not differ statistically as well as the composite Filtek Supreme flow. The Riva \n\nmaterial shows a smaller result statistically different between both groups. \n\nAccording to the elastic modulus data (Tab.8) the composite (Filtek Supreme flow) and \n\nthe flowable resin composite (Wave) had the highest values in 24h, statistically difference \n\nbetween them. Regarding the experimental flowable composite (VSG3) and Riva showed \n\nstatistically lower values. At 3 months, there was no statistically difference between all groups \n\ntested. Regarding the experimental flowable composite (VSG1 and VSG2) and the composite \n\n(Filtek Supreme flow) showed statistically highest values in 6 months in comparing to the \n\nothers groups. There was no statistically difference between Filtek Supreme flow and VSG1. \n\nThe Riva material and the experimental group (VSG3) shows a smaller result no statistically \n\ndifferent between both groups. When was analysed the elastic modulus values in the same \n\ngroup during all time storage, the experimental flowable composite (VSG1) not showed \n\nstatistically difference between 24h and 6 months to lower values  during 3 months. The \n\nexperimental material (VSG2) showed statistically difference between 3 and 6 months \n\nshowing a decrease in their values. Regarding the experimental flowable composite (VSG3 \n\nand VSG4) not showed statistically different between the all storage period. The comercial \n\n\n\n  42  \n \n\nmaterial (Riva) showed statistically difference between 3 and 6 months showing a decrease in \n\ntheir values during 6 months. Highest values (p?0.05) was obtained to flowable resin \n\ncomposite (Wave) during 6 months, the same composite showed statistically different between \n\n24h months. The resin composite (Filtek Supreme flow) showed statistically different between \n\nthe all storage period. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\nThe hypothesis that calcium phosphate used as a filler in experimental flowable \n\ncomposites interfere on the mechanical properties was confirmed. The highest hardness value \n\nobtained in the region of interface for the control group (VSG1), once that this material had not \n\nphosphate in their composition, can be justified by the higher amount of fillers in their \n\ncomposition (50%wt of barium glass) which gives a lower light penetration and consequently \n\nlower monomers conversion. In relation the decrease values after 6 months when analysed the  \n\ncomposite region can be attributed to polymer hydrolisis and the swelling tension induced by \n\nwater (36). The swelling and the hydrolysis degradation process is also inflluenced by type, \n\nshape and surface treatment of the filler used within the composition of experimental flowable \n\ncomposite (37, 38). Indeed, durign water-induced swelling, the resin matrix decreases the \n\ncohesive forces within the polymer chains, generating tensile tensions on the bonding interface \n\nbetween silane coupling agent and fillers (39). This latter phenomenon may induce filler de-\n\nbonding and contribute to the reduction of the KHN of resin composites after prolonged water \n\nimmersion (36-38, 40). Generally, optimum silane coverage of filler particles increases the \n\nresistance of the material to hydrolytic degradation (42).  However, in prolonged exposure to an \n\naqueous environment such as 4 weeks according Marovic et al., 2014 (43), hydrolytic \n\ndegradation of composite materials can be associated with the hydrolysis of the silane layer of \n\nthe silica particles (22). In this study, the specimens were storage in PBS solution during 6 \n\nmonths, time enough that this could have been a hydrolytic degradation of the silane layer of \n\nexperimental materials. The size of the particles in nano range also means that there is a larger \n\nfiller surface area covered with silane, which is susceptible to degradation and an extra pathway \n\nis opened up for water diffusion, especially if they are agglomerated (43).  \n\nThe degree of conversion is the percentage of carbonic double bonds (C = C) converted \n\nto single bonds (C-C) during curing to form a polymeric resin. As the higher DC, better the \n\n\n\n  43  \n \n\nmechanical and wear resistance. It seems that reducing filler content together with increasing \n\nfiller size plays a crucial role in achieving higher translucency of bulk-fill resin composites. The \n\namount of light transmitted through a composite material depends on the amount of scattered \n\nand absorbed light. Light scattering is increased in materials with a large filler-matrix interface \n\narea, due to differences in the refractive index between filler particles and resin matrix (47). \n\nThus, the higher values of DC presented to the VSG4 material (Tab. 6) during the first 40 \n\nseconds, 24h, 3 and 6 months, refer to the lower amount of fillers in their composition (20%wt \n\nof barium glass) which gives a greater light penetration and consequently greater monomers \n\nconversion. The same result was obtained with the experimental material VSG3 (which has \n\n30% filler particle) during the first month. Similar to the values found to Filtek Supreme \n\nflow.According to the literature, despite the inorganic particles of composite resin are more \n\nrelated to wear resistance properties and radiopacity characteristics of the material, many \n\nauthors make a correlation between the degree of conversion and the size and heterogeneity \n\nparticles. According to Ruyter &amp; Osayed (1982) (56), the light scattering that occurs within the \n\ncomposite caused by charged particles is inversely proportional to the particle diameter and \n\ndirectly proportional to their refraction index. Another author Asmussen, 1982 (57, 58), \n\nconfirmed these findings where small diameter particles loading lead to lower depth of cure, \n\nincreased number of double bonds and therefore lower degree of conversion. It was used on this \n\nstudy the same type of filler particle, differing only on the concentration. \n\nThe flexural strength is related to the force at which the beam fails and the sample \n\ngeometry and the flexural modulus is an indication of the stiffness of the beam and is \n\ndetermined by measuring the deformation of the beam as the force is initially applied (19). \n\nModulus of elasticity has a crucial role in the deformability of a material under masticatory \n\nstresses. A material with a low modulus is desired for restorations in cervical areas (59). \n\nHowever, when placed in posterior regions, it will deform more readily under occlusal forces \n\n(19). According to ISO 4049 test methods (2009) has set 80 MPa as the minimum flexural \n\nstrength for resin-based restorative materials involving outer occlusal surfaces. Moreau et al., \n\n2012 (60) reported in their studies that the flexural strength for a traditional composite after 14 \n\ndays of immersion is 30-40 MPa. When used CaP fillers this flexural strength had higher \n\nflexural strengths of 70-110 MPa after 90 days of immersion, and 50-70 MPa after 2 years of \n\n\n\n  44  \n \n\nimmersion. All of the flowable materials tested in this study as the commercial materials \n\nexceeded this value (Tab.7). \n\nA recente study investigating experimental composite materials with various loads \n\nof silanized nanoparticles found a positive correlation between the filler mass fraction and the \n\nFM (63). The exception was the material with 50wt% of silica, which had statistically lower FM \n\nthan the material with 40wt% of filler. This effect is explained by the tendency of silica to \n\nagglomaration. The agglomerated particles were identified as strength controlling flaws which \n\ninitiated crack and consequently lead to the fracture (63). On the other hand, if not \n\nagglomerated, large surface to volume ratio of silanized s\u00edlica particles improves interface \n\nbonding and thus the resistance to fracture. In this study it was observed that the experimental \n\nmaterials with a lower percentage by weight of filler particle (barium aluminum silicate glass \n\nsilanized) had the lowest values of bending in the period of 24h, 3 and 6 month. Disagreeing \n\nwith the results (63) when referring to the material with 50 wt% silica, which obtained low \n\nvalues, which did not occur in this assessment regarding the control group (0% phosphate and \n\n50% load) and VSG2 (10% phosphate and 40% load) which showed higher flexural strength \n\nafter 6 months.  \n\nDespite achieve of minimum ISO flexural strength requirements, it is still recommended \n\nthat flowable materials be restricted to minimal or adjunctive clinical situations. The properties \n\nof resin composites depend primarily on the material composition. A correlation exists between \n\nfiller content and mechanical properties, particularly for elastic modulus (64):  the higher the \n\nfiller content, the higher the modulus and the greater the resistance to deformation. Conversely, \n\nthe lower the filler content, the greater the polymerization shrinkage and the lower the ability to \n\nresist to deformation. The best compromise for most restorations appears to be a fine hybrid \n\nresin composite with a flexural modulus of approximately 10 GPa (65). The experimental \n\nflowable composites showed stiffness values ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 GPa. This suggests that \n\nsome groups are not sufficiently rigid to withstand significant occlusal forces when used in \n\nbulk, once that the best value estimated for most hybrid composites is a flexural modulus of \n\napproximately 10 GPa (65). Thus, the experimental materials VSG1 and VSG2 appear to be the \n\nmost suitable materials for withstand significant occlusal forces when used in bulk, with values \n\nnear to Filtek Supreme flow. The groups VSG1 and VSG2 has in its composition higher filler \n\ncontent, namely 50% and 40% compared to the other groups. \n\n\n\n  45  \n \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\n \n\nIt is concluded that the use of calcium phosphate as fillers affect the mechanical \n\nproperties in some tests after aging, by contrast, there was an increase in some mechanical \n\nproperties tests. The experimental material VSG4 showed high values in the interface after 6 \n\nmonths of storage in PBS solution, suggesting a bioremineralization. High flexural strength \n\nvalues were found for the experimental material VSG2 well as the commercial material Wave. \n\nHigher elasticity modulus was obtained for the experimental material VSG4, similar values to \n\nthe commercial Filtek Supreme flow. \n\n \n\n6.

The dentin specimens were randomly divided into four groups \n\naccording to the composition (n=5) and submitted to microtensile bond strength, \n\nnanoleakage evaluation and confocal-micropermeability (CLSM). According the \n\nmicrotensile results, interactions between factors were no significant (p?0.05). The failure \n\nmode analysis presented adhesive and cohesive failure in resin for the all groups in 24h and 6 \n\nmonths. The silver uptake within the resin-dentin interface showed a lower deposition \n\nrestricted on the basis the hybrid layer to the VSG2 and VSG4 group after 6 months. CLSM \n\n(reflection/fluorescence) of the resin-dentin interface showed moderate micropermeability \n\nbetween dentin and hybrid layer specially localized at the bottom of the rhodamine and \n\nnanoleakage signs at the hybrid layer in 24h to the (VSG1), (VSG2 and VSG3) group. After \n\nprolonged 6 months, the CLMS image showed lower micropermeability between dentin and \n\nhybrid layer and nanoleakage signs at the hybrid layer. A lower micropermeability was \n\nobserved to group VSG4 in 24h and 6 month. Data were subjected to variance analysis with \n\ntwo factors and Tukey\u2019s test (? = 0.05). The inclusion of calcium phosphate -based micro-\n\nfillers within the composition of resin flowable composite and the use of metaphosphates in \n\nspecific self-etching primer might promote a therapeutic mineral deposition within the resin-\n\ndentin interface. The experimental material VSG3 and VSG4 were the most promising to \n\npromote remineralization in dentin interface / resin. \n\n \n\n\n\n  58  \n \n\nKeywords: Bonding durability. Nanoleakage. Microtensile bond strength. Resin-dentin \n\ninterfaces. Confocal-micropermeability. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction  \n\nResin-dentin bonds are less durable than resin-enamel bonds (1), because dentin \n\nbonding relies on organic components.  Bond durability is critical for the longevity of \n\nrestoratives, because degradation can weaken adhesion and lead to gaps between teeth and \n\nrestoratives (2). One of the reasons that leading to loss of the union is the incomplete \n\npermeation of resin monomers within of the hybrid layer by fluid movement within the dentinal \n\ntubule anastomosis complex during resin infiltration (3). Thus, the exposed collagen fibrils \n\nresulting from incomplete resin infiltration cannot be protected against denaturation challenges \n\nand are susceptible to creep or cyclic fatigue rupture after prolonged function (4, 5). These \n\ndenuded collagen matrices are also filled with water, which serves as a functional medium for \n\nthe hydrolysis of resin matrices by esterases and collagen by endogenous and exogenous \n\ncollagenolytic enzymes. Even when water-rich, resin-sparse collagen fibrils can be prevented \n\nfrom degradation, the mechanical properties of these denuded collagen fibrils are far inferior to \n\nthose of resin-infiltrated collagen or mineralized collagen(6). These issues are the critical \n\nbarriers to future progress in dentin bonding. \n\nBiomimetic mineralization is a proof-of-concept strategy that utilizes nanotechnology \n\nprinciples to mimic what occurs in biomineralization (7). This strategy replaces water from \n\nresin-sparse regions of the hybrid layer with apatite crystallites that are small enough to occupy \n\nthe extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar compartments of the collagen matrix, and has been adopted \n\nfor remineralization of resin-dentin interface (8). By restoring the enzyme exclusion and \n\nfossilization properties of mineralized dentin, this proof-of-concept strategy is capable of \n\npreserving the longevity of resin-dentin bonds (9-11). \n\nPartial demineralization of mineralized collagen matrix by acids derived from bacteria or \n\ndentin bonding procedures creates the seed crystallites necessary for this top-down \n\nremineralization approach. The orientation of those remineralized crystalline lattices is pre-\n\ndetermined by the lattice of the original seed crystallites. However, remineralization does not \n\noccur in locations where seed crystallites are absent, as demonstrated with the use of a glass-\n\n\n\n  59  \n \n\nionomer cement (9-11). This limitation severely restricts the apatite-sparse hybrid layers created \n\nby etch-and-rinse and moderately aggressive self-etch adhesives to be remineralized with a \n\nconventional top-down approach. During biomineralization, there are no apatite seed crystallites \n\npresent in an organic scaffold. Consequently, biomineralization has to proceed via an alternative \n\npathway that involves homogeneous nucleation. One of the mechanisms of homogeneous \n\nnucleation involves sequestration of the amorphous mineral phase by polyanionic extracellular \n\nmatrix protein molecules. Additional acidic matrix phosphoproteins are utilized as templates to \n\ninduce mineral nucleation and growth within the organic scaffold (12). \n\nThus, two biomimetic analogs (sequestration and templating) must be utilized in concert \n\nto reproduce the dimension and hierarchy of the apatite crystallites that are found in natural \n\nmineralized dentin. Both hybrid layers created by etch-and-rinse adhesives (13) and self-etch \n\nadhesives (14) have been shown to be remineralizable with a biomimetic mineralization \n\napproach.For etch-and-rinse adhesives, apatite crystallites can be detected in both extrafibrillar \n\nand intrafibrillar spaces, since denuded collagen matrices are present within those hybrid layers. \n\nIt is amazing how strikingly similar the remineralized part of the hybrid layer is when compared \n\nwith hybrid layers that have undergone degradation after aging. For self-etch adhesives, apatite \n\ndeposition is almost exclusively identified from the intrafibrillar spaces, indicating that the \n\nextrafibrillar spaces are better infiltrated by adhesive resins. In addition, water-filled spaces \n\nwithin the adhesive layers of some adhesives are also filled by apatite nanocrystals (9-11, 14).  \n\nUnlike the conventional top-down remineralization approach that proceeds rapidly via \n\nepitaxial growth over existing seed crystallites, biomimetic remineralization is a slower process, \n\nsince it involves at least two kinetically driven pathways and usually takes 3-4 months to \n\ncomplete. Thus, it is important to prevent the collagen matrix from degrading while it is being \n\nremineralized. In a proof-of-concept biomimetic remineralization strategy, polyvinylphosphonic \n\nacid has been shown to possess MMP-inhibiting properties that prevent collagen degradation \n\nduring remineralization (15, 16). \n\nIt has been stated that  CaP likely plays a special role as a precursor to bioapatite and as \n\na transient phase in biomineralization (26). In solutions, CaP is readily converted to stable \n\ncrystalline phases such as apatitic products. A variety of proteins and ions have been proposed \n\nto be involved in the biomineralization of CaP to HA (10, 11, 28-30). Of all the biologically \n\nimportant calcium phosphates is the most researched because their stoichiometry and high \n\n\n\n  60  \n \n\nrelease of calcium and phosphate ions in aqueous media exhibiting the most rapid conversion to \n\nHA. Recently was developed polymeric dental composites (31-35) that utilized these CaP \n\nproperties to remineralize bovine enamel lesions in vitro (32). However, as currently \n\nformulated, these bioactive CaP composites have relatively low mechanical strength and \n\nadhesiveness to teeth. To improve their mechanical properties while maintaining sustained \n\nrelease of Ca and PO4 ions, the researches have so far focused on: (a) synthesizing CaP fillers \n\nwith structurally incorporated silica and/or zirconia, (b) developing surface-modified hybrid \n\nCaP fillers amenable to treatment by silane coupling agents (33, 35, 36), and (c) exploring the \n\neffects of polymer matrix composition on the mechanical and physico-chemical properties of \n\nCaP composites (31-35).  \n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive calcium phosphate \n\n(MCPM and ?TCP) as a filler in experimental flowable composite on dentin bond strength and \n\nfurthermore evaluated the micropermeability and nanoleakage in hybrid layer, once that was \n\nused sodium tri-metaphosphate in specific self-primer. The first and second hypothesis was that \n\nthe presence of calcium-phosphate modified the adhesive properties, and the presence of \n\nmetaphosphates in specific primer failed to induce remineralization in the hybrid layer subjected \n\nto degradation after aging, indicating that the water-filled spaces inside the adhesive layers were \n\nnot filled by apatite nanocrystals, generated by the use of sodium tri-metaphosphate. \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1 Composite and self-etching primer formulations  \n\n \n\nThe resin matrix for all formulations can be showed in Table 1. Each composite was \n\nloaded with MCPM (Monocalcium phosphate monohydrate [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP (?-\n\nTricalcium phosphate [Fluka, Germany] and Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2). Each \n\ngroup had received a different concentration related to phosphates and calcium hydroxide \n\npowder (0wt%, 10wt%, 20wt% and 30wt%). After this, was added Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, \n\nJoinvile, SC, Brazil) powder at a concentration of (50wt%, 40wt% 30wt% and 20wt%) for each \n\nexperimental group (Tab. 3). Then a resin matrix was added in the end by 50wt%. The \n\nexperimental self-etching primer were obtained can be showed in Table 4. \n\n \n\n\n\n  61  \n \n\n2.2 Experimental design \n\nThe dentin specimens were randomly divided into four groups according to the \n\ncomposition of the experimental flowable composite (Tab.3). \n\n2.3 Sample preparation \n\nForty caries-free third human molars extracted for surgical reasons under a protocol \n\napproved by an institutional review board (ref. 150/2012) were used in this study (n=5) (20 \n\nteeth-24h and 20 teeth-6m). The teeth were stored in deionised water (pH 7.1) at 4\u00b0C, for 24h \n\nand 6 months. Coronal dentin specimens were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath \n\nthe cement-enamel junction (CEJ) using a hard tissue microtome (Isomet 11/180; Buehler, \n\nCoventry, UK) equipped with a diamond blade (XL-12205; Benetec, London, UK). The smear \n\nlayer-covered middle coronal dentin was exposed by removing the occlusal enamel with a \n\nparallel cut and by a polishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC paper for 1 min under continuous \n\nwater irrigation.  \n\nThe bonded-dentin specimens were submitted to a simulated pulpal pressure method (SPP). \n\nThe simulation of the hydrostatic pulpal pressure was accomplished as previously described por \n\nFeitosa et al., 2012 (17-19). This method is shown in Fig. 1. \n\n2.4 Dentin pre-treatment and bonding procedures \n\n \n\n  The self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared surfaces dentin with \n\nmicrobrush and solvent evaporated with compressed air for 10 seconds. The experimental \n\nflowable composites (according to each experimental group) were used to build-up (3 layers \u2013 \n\n1mm each). Each composite layer was light-cured for a period of 20s using a quartz-tungsten-\n\nhalogen lamp (Optilux-501; Kerr) and the last coat was light-cured for 40s with light intensity \n\nof 850 mW / cm\u00b2. \n\n \n\n2.5  Microtensile bond strength test (\u00b5TBS) \n\n \n\nResin-bonded teeth were sectioned in small resin-dentin beams (1mm\n2\n) suitable for the \n\nmicrotensile bond strength. After 24h and 6 months in PBS solution storage, the resin-bonded \n\n\n\n  62  \n \n\nspecimens from each group were sectioned using a hard tissue microtome (Buehler, UK) in both \n\nx and y directions across the bonding interface obtaining beams with cross-sectional areas of \n\n1mm\n2\n. The beams obtained peripherally including enamel were excluded from the \u00b5TBS test.  \n\nThe beams tested after 24h and 6 months immersion in PBS solution (37\u00b0C). After this time, \n\nthe beams were glued to a jig with a cyanoacrylate gel (Super bonder gel; Loctite Henkel, \n\nRocky Hill, CT, USA) and were subjected to tensile load in a SMAC LAL300 linear actuator \n\ntesting machine (SMAC Ltd., West Sussex, UK) with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The \n\nforce required to break the adhesive bond was recorded in MPa. The \u00b5TBS data were subjected \n\nto variance analysis with two factors and Tukey\u2019s test (? = 0.05%).  \n\n \n\n2.5.1 Failure mode analysis and scanning electron microscopy ultra-morphology \n\nSubsequent to the ?TBS tests each failed beam was evaluated by stereomicroscopy (Kyowa \n\nOptical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 \u00d7 0.75 objective, for assessment of the mode and \n\nlocus of tensile failure. The mode of failure of the fractured specimens was determined and \n\nclassified as follows: Type A: Adhesive failure at the interface among resin composite, adhesive \n\nresin and hybrid layer; Type B: Mixed failure. Both adhesive and cohesive failures observed in \n\nthe same fractured stick; Type C: Cohesive failure in resin; Type D: Cohesive failure in dentin \n\nFive representative samples exhibiting the most frequently observed failure pattern (i.e. \n\nmixed or cohesive) and the ?TBS close to the mean, were prepared for scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM) ultra-morphology analysis. The parts of the fractured samples were paired \n\nand mounted on aluminum stubs, coated with gold (Balzers SCD 050 sputter coater, B.U.A. \n\nCo., F\u00fcrstentum, Germany) and examined by SEM, JSM-5600LV (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), \n\noperated at 15 kV, with 20 mm as work distance. \n\n2.6  Nanoleakage evaluation \n\n \n\n Three central beams (n=12) were selected from the teeth of each group and processed for \n\nnanoleakage assessment as previously described by Tay et al., 2002 (17). In brief, the beams \n\nwere immersed in 50wt% ammoniacal silver nitrate [Ag(NH3)\n2\n]NO3 (aq) solution in total \n\ndarkness for 24h. Subsequently, the specimens were rinsed in H2O to remove the excess silver \n\nnitrate and then immersed in a photo-developing solution for 8h under UV-light (60 cm from \n\n\n\n  63  \n \n\nthe specimens) to reduce silver ions into metallic silver grains along the resin-dentin interface. \n\nThe silver-impregnated beams will be included in epoxy resin and wet-polished using #600, \n\n#1200, #2000 SiC papers and diamond pastes (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) 6, 3, 1 and 0.25 \n\n\u00b5m. The specimens were ultrasonically cleaned for 20min after each abrasive/polishing step. \n\nFinally, they were air-dried, dehydrated overnight, coated with carbon and observed using a \n\nSEM (JSM-5600LV; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in backscattered electron mode. \n\n \n\n2.7 Confocal micropermeability evaluation (CLSM) \n\nFour specimens for each group (two specimens- 24h and two specimens-6 months) were \n\nprepared as previously described and prepared for confocal micropermeability evaluation (18). \n\nThe resin bonded dentin specimens to evaluate the features of micropermeability along the \n\ninterface were prepared with 1g of resin blend without metaphosphate and fillers was mixed \n\nwith Rhodamine-B (0.1wt%) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA).  The resin blend labeled \n\nwith Rhodamine-B was applied in the first coat and light-cured for 20s. The experimental \n\nflowable composites were used to perform the build-up (3 layers \u2013 1mm each).  Briefly, the \n\nevaluation of micropermeability of resin\u2013dentin interfaces was performed using a 0.1wt% dye \n\nwater/ethanol (50v%/50v%) solution (FITC- fluorescein isothiocyanate; Sigma-Aldrich). This \n\nfluorescent dye was used to trace the water-filled spaces and the sealing ability from the pulp \n\nchamber through the tubules to the resin\u2013dentin interface for 3 h at 37\u00b0C able to covalently bind \n\ncollagen. \n\nThe specimens were subsequently cut into 1 mm slabs, slightly polished with wet 1200 \n\nSiC-grit paper and ultra-sonicated for 5 min. Three slabs from each specimen were selected for \n\nconfocal microscopy (6 slabs/group). Three images were obtained from each slice resulting in \n\nnine images per specimen and 18 images per group. These images were intended to be \n\nrepresentative of the most common features regarding the micropermeability observed along the \n\ninterfaces. \n\nThe microscopy examination was performed using a laser confocal scanning microscope \n\n(CLSM: Leica SP2 CLSM, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a 63x/1.4 NA oil immersion \n\nlens using 514 nm argon/helium ion laser illumination both in reflection and fluorescence mode. \n\nThe fluorescein was excited at 488-nm, while Rhodamine was used at 568-nm krypton laser. \n\nA\\Reflected and fluorescence signals were detected with a photomultiplier tube to a depth of \n\n\n\n  64  \n \n\n20 ?m and then converted to single-projection images for better visualization and qualitative \n\nanalysis (18). \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 Microtensile bond strength test (\u00b5TBS) \n\nInteractions between factors were no significant (p?0.05). Material (experimental \n\ncomposite with different concentrations of phosphate) and storage time (24h and 6 months) no \n\ninfluenced the \u00b5TBS results. Mean (\u00b1S.D.) \u00b5TBS of the resin-bonded dentin tested in this study \n\nare shown in Tab. 5.  \n\n3.2 Failure mode and SEM ultra-morphological analysis  \n\nThe failure mode analysis is presented in Tab. 6 and Fig. 2 and showed adhesive failure \n\n(Type A) and cohesive failure in resin (Type C). The control group (VSG1) in 24h showed \n\nfailure mode adhesive (80.39%) and cohesive failure in resin (17.65%). However, after 6 \n\nmonths the failured mode showed 63.38% to 32.39% adhesive and cohesive failure in resin, \n\nbesides 2.82% mixed failure (Type B). High percentage of adhesive failure mode (95.83%) \n\noccurred in 24h to the experimental group (VSG2-10% phosphate) and 4.17% cohesive failure \n\nin resin. At 6 months, the failure mode showed adhesive (46.25%) and cohesive failure in \n\nresin (53.75%). For the experimental group (VSG3- 20% phosphate) was observed (69.84%) \n\nfailure mode adhesive and cohesive failure in resin (30.16%) during 24h. After 6 months, the \n\nsamples showed (62.07% to 37.93%) failure mode adhesive and cohesive failure in resin. The \n\nexperimental group (VSG4-30% phosphate), in 24h, showed (47.06% to 50.98%) failure mode \n\nadhesive and cohesive failure in resin. After 6 months, the SEM analysis detected (48.21% to \n\n51.79%) failure mode adhesive and cohesive failures in resin. \n\n Evaluating only the cohesive failure in resin, the experimental group VSG2 at 6 months \n\nhad 53.75% failures mode compared to 4.17% in 24 hours. The group VSG3 remained their \n\nvalues near each other in relation to the storage period (30.16% and 37.93% in 24 hours and \n\nafter 6 months). The same situation occurred to the experimental group VSG4 with values \n\nfrom 50.98% and 51.79% in 24h and 6 months. Relating these failures with the control group \n\n(VSG1) in the period of 6 months (32.39%), it is seen that the values from the other groups \n\napproached and /or increased for this type C failure mode (Cohesive failure in resin). \n\n\n\n  65  \n \n\nThe photomicrographs showing the fractures types that occurred at the interfaces of the \n\nexperimental groups studied are illustrated in Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. \n\n \n\n3.3 Nanoleakage evaluation  \n\n The nanoleakage patterns observed during the SEM analysis are illustrated in Fig. 9, \n\n10, 11 and 12. The silver uptake within the resin-dentin interfaces stored in PBS solution \n\nfor 24h and 6 months showed for experimental group (VSG1) the presence of silver metalic \n\ngrains on the basis the hybrid layer but not in the rest of the hybrid layer, indicating non-\n\nuniform nanoleakage. During the 6 months were observed moderate amount silver metalic \n\ngrains in parts of the hybrid layer (Fig. 9). A large silver deposit within the layer composite \n\nclose to the adhesive layer was observed in the material (VSG2). At 6 months the amount \n\nof silver metallic grains was visually lower compared to deposition in the sample of 24 h \n\nand restricted on the basis the hybrid layer (Fig. 10). The highest silver uptake was \n\nobserved for the material (VSG3 and VSG4) with intense silver deposits filling hybrid and \n\nadhesive layer. During the 6 months were observed a lower amount silver metallic grains \n\non the basis of the hybrid layer and on top of the adhesive layer (Fig. 11 and 12). \n\n \n\n3.3 Confocal micropermeability evaluation (CLSM) \n\nCLSM single projections (reflection/fluorescence) after 24h and 6 months of the \n\nresin-dentin interfaces created using the self-etching primer with sodium trimetaphosphate \n\nand polyacrylic acid in PBS storage are illustrated in Fig. 13-16. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\nThe results of this study showed no statistical difference to the microtensile test (p \n\n?0.05), between 24 hours and 6 months (Tab.5). In this case the first hypothesis that the \n\npresence of calcium-phosphate would change the adhesive properties was confirmed. These \n\nresults were supported by the analysis of the failure mode (SEM) which showed that the storage \n\ninduced adhesive failures (Fig. 2).  \n\n\n\n  66  \n \n\nThis phenomenom may have occurred due to the inability of such materials to \n\ncompletely replace loosely bound and bulk-free water from the apatite-depleted dentin collagen \n\nmatrix during bonding procedures (19, 20). The wetness of dentin surfaces, the presence of \n\npulpal pressure, and the thickness of dentin are extremely important variables during bonding \n\nprocedures, especially when testing bond strength of adhesive materials in vitro within the \n\nintention of simulating in vivo conditions (21-26).  \n\nThe application of simulated pulpal pressure obviously increases convective fluid \n\nmovement and reveals through-and-through water-channels through some, but not all, \n\npolymerized resins, that connect underlying dentin with the outer adhesive surface (23-25, 27). \n\nThese water-filled channels are potential sites of hydrolytic degradation that may adversely \n\naffect the longevity of restorations bonded. The presence of simulated physiological pulpal \n\npressure through hybrid and adhesive layers may provide more polymer hydrolysis and \n\nplasticisation jeopardising the long-term durability of resin-dentin-interfaces (28-32). \n\nSome authors contend that a relative degree of nanoleakage correlates with dentin \n\nremineralization (19). The etiology of tubular occlusion by apatite crystallites, has been \n\ndescribed as \"dissolution and re-precipitation\" mechanism where the deposited crystals on \n\nhybrid layer occlude the dentinal tubules (21). Comparing the control group (0% phosphate- \n\nVSG1) after 6 months with the other experimental materials (10%-VSG2, 20%-VSG3 and 30% \n\nphosphate-VSG4) it was visually observed a lower amount metallic silver deposited on the \n\nhybrid layer to these materials, suggesting that the dentinal tubules were partially occluded by \n\napatite crystals. As the calcium phosphate concentrations were different for each experimental \n\ngroup, those groups with higher concentration of such elements showed lower deposition of \n\nsilver grains in the hybrid layer (Fig. 11, 12).  \n\nThe micropermeability of resin-bonded dentin can be seen using confocal laser scanning \n\nmicroscopy (CLSM), a technique that involving the filtration of a fluorescente dye from the \n\npulp chamber into the resin-dentin interface into the pulp chamber of extracted resin-bonded \n\nteeth (18, 20) without the need to immerse specimens in fluorophores or silver nitrate solution. \n\nThis analysis reveals the microporosity and pathways for water permeability in the hybrid layer \n\nbefore and after remineralization (18, 21, 22).  \n\nCLMS images of the resin-dentin interface showed a thick hybrid layer completely \n\ninfiltrated by fluorescein due to imperfect resin infiltration within the demineralised collagen \n\n\n\n  67  \n \n\nmatrix and some resin-tags penetration several microns into the dentinal tubules to the \n\nVSG1,VSG2 and VSG3 group during 24h (Fig. 13- A1, 14-B1, 15-C1) result of increased resin-\n\ninfiltrated demineralized dentin collagen and degradation of the interface after PSB storage. \n\nAfter 6 months, the interfaces showed a lower micropermeability (Fig. 13-B2, 14-C2 and 15-\n\nD2).This sight of degradation might have, additionally, resulted from the slightly acidic \n\nenvironment promoted by the permanent release of H+ from the acidic monomers (GDMAP \n\nand polyacrylic acid), and by the precipitation reaction of the brushite (phosphate and calcium), \n\nwhich caused a long-standing, MMP-mediated degradation of collagen (23).  \n\n It has been reported that supersaturated calcium (Ca) phosphate (P) solutions have little \n\neffectiveness, per se, to induce dentin remineralization. A possible explanation for this feature \n\nmay be due to mineral precipitation (Ca, P) within the organic matrix by the metaphosphates \n\n(sodium trimetaphosphate and polyacrilic acid) reducing the micropermeability as occured in \n\nthe experimental materials VSG2, VSG3 and VGS4, whereas for VSG3 and VSG4 groups this \n\ndecrease was more pronounced. The new semi-permeable physical barrier created at the bottom \n\nof the hybrid layer hindered the penetration of the green dye throughout the hybrid layer, and \n\nremained located not beyond this area. Short resin tags were, additionally, observed indicating \n\nthe formation of some partical seal and an increase in calcification in dentin tubules (24).  \n\nMineral crystallites remaining within the collagen after partial demineralisation might \n\nhave acted as seed sites for apatite growth (25). The polyacrylic acid and the acidic monomer \n\n(GDMAP) represents the most aggressive conditioning of dentin that was considered in the \n\npresent research, that dissolved a big part of both the extrafibrillar and the intrafibrillar mineral, \n\nin extension and depth, increasing the difficulty of resin infiltration throughout this \n\ndemineralisation front, showing high ratios of micropermeability as a consequence of the poor \n\nresin-infiltrated demineralised dentin collagen, comprising the stability of this interface, over \n\ntime  (26).  \n\nIt is well known that the increase in environment pH and the presence of free OH\n-\n may \n\nfacilitate apatite nucleation and reduce the solubility of intermediate Ca/P species formed during \n\nthe aging period (27). The most appropriate pH to support the formation of stoichiometric \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA) in vitro (27) and in vivo  (28) falls in range between 8 and 9. At higher pH \n\nit is common to obtain a Ca-deficient HA (lower solubility then stoichiometric hydroxyapatite) \n\n\n\n  68  \n \n\ncharacterized by higher concentration of PO4\n3-\n\n and lower Ca\n2+\n\n ions  (29-31). Thus, the second \n\nhypothesis was confirmed. \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nAccording the limitations of this study the conclusions were: \n\n- the calcium phosphate addition as a filler particles not affected the bond strength, \n\n- the use of metaphosphate in self-etching primers promoted mineral deposition on  \n\nresin-dentin interface. \n\n \n\n6.

Este cristal DCPD (ou bruxita) \n\n\u00e9 um dos mais sol\u00faveis cristais de apatita, por\u00e9m ele pode fornecer um modelo de pr\u00e9-\n\nnuclea\u00e7\u00e3o para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos cristais de hidroxiapatita. A bruxita pode ser formada por \n\nmeio da mistura equimolar de beta-tri-c\u00e1lcio fosfato (?-TCP) e mono-c\u00e1lcio fosfato mono-\n\nhidratado (MCFM) (29). A partir de uma nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o e estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos cristais de bruxita, \n\nos cristais de DCPD podem se transformar em cristais com estrutura mais organizada \n\n(menos sol\u00faveis) e mais parecidas \u00e0quela da hidroxiapatita (Ca10(PO4)6OH2). Assim a \n\npresen\u00e7a de p\u00f3 de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio bioativo (MCPM e ?-TCP) adaptados como part\u00edculas \n\nde carga nos comp\u00f3sitos flu\u00eddos experimentais em contato com as superf\u00edcies de dentina \n\ndesmineralizada induziu \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de cristais de hidroxiapatita a partir da presen\u00e7a de \n\nbandas de fosfato v1, v3 (PO4\n3\n) e apatita  carbonatada (v2) (CO3\n\n2\n) como visto no Cap\u00edtulo 1. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, foi detectado a presen\u00e7a de cristais de bruxita pela presen\u00e7a de bandas (vOH). \n\nEstas bandas foram detectadas  ao longo do tempo independente da porcentagem de fosfato \n\nde c\u00e1lcio e presen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua destilada e/ou solu\u00e7\u00e3o tamponada (PBS). A presen\u00e7a de picos \n\nreferentes \u00e0s bandas de fosfatos (v1, v3)  e apatita carbonatada  (v2) no grupo controle  \n\nVSG1-  0% fosfato durante os primeiros  7 dias e 3 meses de imers\u00e3o \u00e9 justificada por \n\narmazenar as amostras em solu\u00e7\u00e3o salina tamponada com cloreto de s\u00f3dio, fosfato de s\u00f3dio, \n\ncloreto de pot\u00e1ssio e fosfato de pot\u00e1ssio, assim, o ambiente fica sobressaturado com \u00edons de \n\nc\u00e1lcio e fornece um meio prop\u00edcio para a nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o da apatita. \n\nUma vez detectado a presen\u00e7a de apatita carbonatada e bruxita nas amostras \n\ndesmineralizadas, foi realizado uma an\u00e1lise em EDX  (Cap\u00edtulo 1) a partir de novas \n\namostras de dentina. Nesse caso, a superf\u00edcie coron\u00e1ria foi tratada com um primer \n\nautocondicionante o qual continha em sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cido poliacr\u00edlico e trimetafosfato de \n\ns\u00f3dio. O objetivo foi verificar a presen\u00e7a de dep\u00f3sitos de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio na interface \n\nremineralizada  a  profundidade de aprox. 80?m. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o Ca/P n\u00e3o mostrou diferen\u00e7a \n\nestat\u00edstica entre os grupos. Os cristais de apatita carbonatada (Ca)10 (PO4,HPO4 (CO3)6 \n\n(OH,Cl)2 s\u00e3o semelhantes \u00e0 hidroxiapatita mineral (Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2 (30). Assim, quando \n\n\n\n  92  \n \n\nse compara a quantidade de Ca por mol\u00e9cula em ambas as f\u00f3rmulas nota-se que a mol\u00e9cula \n\nde  HA (hidroxiapatita) tem 60 \u00e1tomos de Ca em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com 10 \u00e1tomos do cristal de \n\napatita carbonatada. Desse modo, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o Ca / P na \u00e1rea remineralizada de acordo com a \n\ndados obtidos sugerem que o n\u00famero desses elementos foram os mesmos, n\u00e3o havendo \n\ndiferen\u00e7a entre os grupos, o que poderia levar a uma diferen\u00e7a no processo de \n\nremineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o,uma vez que foi utilizado diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de fosfatos favorecendo \n\nmaior ou menor a\u00e7\u00e3o desses elementos no processo de nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nA remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do col\u00e1geno ocorre por aposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos cristais recentemente \n\nformados, havendo assim a necessidade de incorporar um agente terap\u00eautico que ajude e \n\nsirva de guia para que os cristais alcancem os substratos mais profundos da rede colag\u00eanica \n\ndesmineralizada.  Esses agentes s\u00e3o os an\u00e1logos biomim\u00e9ticos que simulam a a\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nfosfoprote\u00ednas dent\u00e1rias que guiam os fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio durante a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dent\u00e1ria. \n\nExistem dois tipos de an\u00e1logos: aqueles que guiam os \u00edons de fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio para a \n\ncristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o a partir da pr\u00e9-nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o (\u00e1cido poliacr\u00edlico) e aqueles que ligam as prote\u00ednas  \n\ndo col\u00e1geno com o material em cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o (\u00e1cido polivinil fosf\u00f4nico e o trimetafosfato de \n\ns\u00f3dio). Assim, tem-se n\u00e3o somente um mecanismo de remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o, como tamb\u00e9m \n\nan\u00e1logos que guiam a bioremineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. A partir disso foi utilizado um primer contendo \n\n\u00e1cido poliacr\u00edlico e trimetafosfato de s\u00f3dio em sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO fosfato monoc\u00e1lcico mono-hidratado (MCPM) (Ca(H2)PO4)2H20) e fosfato \n\ntric\u00e1lcico Ca3(PO4)2 s\u00e3o sais de c\u00e1lcio que, na presen\u00e7a do mon\u00f4mero ac\u00eddico (GDMAP) \u00e9 \n\nhidrolisado pela acelera\u00e7\u00e3o destes mon\u00f3meros (isto \u00e9, a mol\u00e9cula de \u00e1gua presente na \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica do MCPM \u00e9 \u201cquebrada\u201d liberando radicais hidroxila). Portanto, a \u00e1gua \n\ndispon\u00edvel para a rea\u00e7\u00e3o prov\u00e9m da dentina e da solu\u00e7\u00e3o salina tamponada (PBS). Assim, \n\nesta \u00e1gua ir\u00e1 reagir com ambos os sais de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio formando DCPD (bruxita). \n\nQuando utilizado \u00e1cido poliacr\u00edlico e an\u00e1logos biomim\u00e9tica (isto \u00e9, trimetafosfato de s\u00f3dio) \n\nem primers autocondicionantes, o \u00e1cido tem a capacidade de inibir a nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o da apatita \n\nantes da entrada nos compartimentos de col\u00e1geno interfibrilar intrafibrilar. O trimetafosfato \n\nde s\u00f3dio sofre quela\u00e7\u00e3o com os \u00edons de c\u00e1lcio. Assim, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de hidr\u00f3xido de c\u00e1lcio, \n\njuntamente com os fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio (MCPM) e (BTCP) t\u00eam a a\u00e7\u00e3o de supersaturar o meio \n\ncom c\u00e1lcio. Assim, o trimetafosfato de s\u00f3dio ir\u00e1 se unir com o c\u00e1lcio saturado e o \u00e1cido \n\npoliacr\u00edlico inibe a nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o da apatita de c\u00e1lcio antes dos mesmos entrarem  nos \n\n\n\n  93  \n \n\ncompartimentos de col\u00e1geno, ou seja, a  apatita se liga ao c\u00e1lcio gerando cristais de apatita \n\ncarbonatada. \n\nAlgumas pesquisas t\u00eam revelado que a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfatos bioativos em \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos odontol\u00f3gicos (31-36) apresentam baixa resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica (32, 36) e \n\nadesividade aos dentes. Um meio para melhorar  estas propriedades e manter a libera\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00edons de Ca e PO4 \u00e9 a sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das part\u00edculas de carga com s\u00edlica e/ou zirc\u00f4nia e  \n\ndesenvolvimento de part\u00edculas de carga pass\u00edveis de  tratamento por agentes silano (33, 34, \n\n37). Assim utilizou-se na referida pesquisa vidro de b\u00e1rio alum\u00ednio silanizado como \n\npart\u00edcula de carga juntamente com os fosfatos bioativos. Foi realizado o teste de \n\nmicrotra\u00e7\u00e3o (Cap\u00edtulo 3) para verificar a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o na interface resina-dentina \n\nap\u00f3s envelhecimento estrat\u00e9gico (sob press\u00e3o pulpar e solu\u00e7\u00e3o de armazenamento em PBS) \n\ne o mesmo n\u00e3o mostrou diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica entre os grupos avaliados. \n\nA micropermeabilidade foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s de microscopia confocal (Cap\u00edtulo 3), \n\numa vez que a mesma  tem a capacidade de avaliar se existe ou n\u00e3o permeabilidade mais \n\nelevada ou baixa (por penetra\u00e7\u00e3o do corante fluoresce\u00edna) e a absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua atrav\u00e9s de \n\ntoda a espessura da camada adesiva e da presen\u00e7a ou n\u00e3o de algumas micro-fissuras que \n\npodem ser respons\u00e1veis pela redu\u00e7\u00e3o da for\u00e7a de uni\u00e3o. O material experimental VSG3 e \n\nVSG4 foram os mais promissores para promover a remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o na interface \n\ndentina/resina, reduzindo a permeabilidade dentin\u00e1ria sem afetar a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o \n\n(Cap\u00edtulo 3). \n\nUma vez ocorrido falha durante o acoplamento do silano com as part\u00edculas de carga \n\nem comp\u00f3sitos convencionais estes podem causar uma acelera\u00e7\u00e3o na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncomp\u00f3sito (38, 39), por outro lado ao utilizar os fosfatos bioativos como part\u00edculas de \n\ncarga, a falha com o silano est\u00e1 relacionada com a interfer\u00eancia durante a libera\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00edons \n\nde c\u00e1lcio e fosfato, o que prejudica as propriedades remineralizantes (40-44).  \n\nAlguns autores afirmam que relativo grau de nanoinfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o correlaciona-se com a \n\nremineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da dentina (45, 46). Isto \u00e9, a nanoinfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o diminui \u00e0 medida que aumenta \n\na remineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, comparando o grupo controle (0% de fosfato), ap\u00f3s 6 meses \n\n(Cap\u00edtulo 3) com os outros materiais experimentais (10%, 20% e 30% de fosfato) foi \n\nvisualmente observada menor quantidade de prata met\u00e1lica depositada sobre a camada \n\nh\u00edbrida a esses materiais, o que sugere que os t\u00fabulos dentin\u00e1rios foram fechados por \n\n\n\n  94  \n \n\ncristais de apatita. \u00c0 medida que as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio eram diferentes para \n\ncada grupo experimental, os grupos com maior concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tais elementos mostrou \n\nmenor deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de gr\u00e3os de prata na camada h\u00edbrida. \n\nPara utilizar estes materiais na pr\u00e1tica cl\u00ednica como material restaurador flu\u00eddo \u00e9 \n\nnecess\u00e1rio que suas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas suportem os esfor\u00e7os da mastiga\u00e7\u00e3o. De \n\nacordo com os resultados, o material VSG4 mostrou valores elevados de dureza na regi\u00e3o \n\nde interface dentina/resina ap\u00f3s 6 meses (Cap\u00edtulo 2) sugerindo bioremineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao \n\nanalisar os valores de dureza na regi\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sito, foi observado queda nesses valores \n\nap\u00f3s 6 meses de imers\u00e3o em PBS; esta queda pode ser atribu\u00edda \u00e0 hidr\u00f3lise dos pol\u00edmeros \n\npela imers\u00e3o em \u00e1gua, uma vez que diminui as for\u00e7as de coes\u00e3o dentro das cadeias de \n\npol\u00edmero, gerando tens\u00f5es de tra\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a interface de uni\u00e3o entre o silano e a part\u00edcula \n\nde carga (47-50). Este \u00faltimo pode induzir \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o nos valores de dureza ap\u00f3s imers\u00e3o \n\nprolongada em \u00e1gua (48-51). \n\n Elevado grau de convers\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m foi observado para o mesmo material \n\nexperimental no per\u00edodo de 3 e 6 meses (Cap\u00edtulo 2) como aumento no seu m\u00f3dulo de \n\nelasticidade (Cap\u00edtulo 2), valores estes semelhantes ao encontrado para o material \n\ncomercial Filtek Supreme. Os maiores valores de DC apresentados ao material VSG4 \n\n(Cap\u00edtulo 2), durante os primeiros 40 segundos, 24 horas, 3 e 6 meses, acredita-se ser \n\ndecorrente da menor quantidade de cargas em sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o (20% em peso de vidro de \n\nb\u00e1rio), a qual favorece \u00e0 maior penetra\u00e7\u00e3o da luz e, conseq\u00fcentemente, maior convers\u00e3o \n\ndos mon\u00f4meros. O mesmo resultado foi obtido com o material experimental VSG3 (que \n\ntem 30% de part\u00edculas de carga) durante o primeiro m\u00eas. Parece que a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de \n\ncarga, juntamente com o aumento do tamanho de part\u00edculas de carga desempenha papel \n\ncrucial no grau de convers\u00e3o, uma vez que haver\u00e1 maior translucidez da massa do \n\ncomp\u00f3sito. A quantidade de luz transmitida atrav\u00e9s de um material comp\u00f3sito depende da \n\nquantidade de luz dispersa e absorvida. A dispers\u00e3o de luz \u00e9 aumentada em materiais com \n\ngrande \u00e1rea de interface matriz-carga, devido a diferen\u00e7as no \u00edndice de refra\u00e7\u00e3o entre as \n\npart\u00edculas de carga e matriz de resina (52).  \n\nO material VSG2 bem como o material comercial Wave obtiveram os maiores \n\nvalores de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 flex\u00e3o (Cap\u00edtulo 2).
