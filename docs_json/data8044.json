For this purpose, chitosan \n\nwas dissolved in aqueous solutions of lactic acid (LA, 1 wt.%) to reach a final \n\nconcentration of 2 wt.%. Subsequently FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 in powder form was added to \n\nchitosan solution in a chitosan/Fasto\u00aeBG-Z4 weight ratio of 50/50. The \n\nChitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 systems were cross-linked via adding different concentrations \n\n(0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 wt.%) of two kinds of cross-linking agents, genipin, a natural \n\ncomponent, and glutaraldehyde, a synthetic agent, to stiffen the chitosan network. The final \n\nmixtures were then frozen at two temperatures, ?20\u00baC and ?80\u00baC followed by freeze-\n\ndrying to obtain porous scaffolds. \n\nFor achieving the optimal Chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 scaffolds, the influences of adding \n\nFastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder and/or different amounts of crosslinking agents on the rheological \n\nproperties of chitosan/LA solutions were firstly investigated by rheological measurements. \n\nThe results showed that a strong and stable gel could not be obtained even when the \n\nhighest amount of cross-linking agents (0.5 wt.%) was added to the 2 wt.% chitosan \n\nsolution, while effective cross-linking occurred in the presence of FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder. \n\nTherefore, it was concluded that FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 plays an active role on chitosan \n\ncomplexation. The positive interactions between chitosan and the surface of FastOs\u00aeBG-\n\nZ4 particles and/or the ionic species leached out to the solution needs to be further \n\ninvestigated in future work. \n\nThe microstructural features of porous scaffolds were investigated by scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM), and the porosity assessment was made by ethanol replacement method. \n\nThe mechanical properties of porous scaffolds were investigated under \n\ncompression/swelling tests with samples immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) \n\nsolution. In vitro degradation tests were also performed by immersing the samples in \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 2 months tests and the degradation degree \n\nwas evaluated through the undergone weight changes.  \n\nThe results showed some common features among genipin or glutaraldehyde as cross-\n\nlinking agents: increasing their amounts from 0.01 to 0.5 wt.% led to reductions in gelling \n\ntime, porosity fraction, swelling and degradation rate, while cross-linking degree increased. \n\nHowever, their effects on pore size and compression strength of the scaffolds diverged. For \n\ngenipin pore size decreased and consequently the compression strength increased, while \n\nfor glutaraldehyde pore size always increased with added amounts, but compression \n\nstrength was improved with concentration increasing from 0.01 to 0.05 wt.%, decreasing \n\nwhen the added amount was further increased to 0.5 wt.%.  \n\nMoreover, ?20\u00baC was selected as the most suitable freezing temperature when \n\nconsidering the porous microstructural features and the intended applications. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nA presente tese relata acerca do fabrico e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sitos porosos \n\ntridimensionais (3D) biodegrad\u00e1veis baseados em quitosano, como matriz biopolim\u00e9rica, \n\ncarregada com part\u00edculas de um vidro bioativo (Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4). Para este efeito, o \n\nquitosano foi dissolvido em solu\u00e7\u00e3o aquosa de \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico (LA, 1% em peso) at\u00e9 atingir \n\numa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o final de 2% em peso. Subsequentemente o Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 em forma de \n\np\u00f3 foi adicionado \u00e0 solu\u00e7\u00e3o de quitosano em uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o em peso de quitosano/ \n\nFastos\u00aeBG-Z4 de 50/50. Os sistemas quitosano/Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 foram reticulados por meio \n\nde adi\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes percentagens em peso (0.01, 0.05 e 0.5) de dois tipos de agentes de \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o cruzada, um componente natural, genipin, e um agente sint\u00e9tico, glutaralde\u00eddo. As \n\nmisturas finais foram ent\u00e3o reticuladas a 60\u00baC seguido de congelamento a duas \n\ntemperaturas diferentes, ?20\u00baC e ?80\u00baC. O gelo foi depois sublimado por liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmodo a obter matrizes porosas para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es como guias em engenharia de tecidos \n\nnervosos perif\u00e9ricos. \n\nCom vista \u00e0 optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de fabrico e das propriedades das estruturas \n\nporosas de suporte (andaimes) de quitosano/Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4, estudaram-se os efeitos da \n\nadi\u00e7\u00e3o do Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 em p\u00f3 e/ou de diferentes quantidades de agentes de reticula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnas propriedades reol\u00f3gicas das solu\u00e7\u00f5es de LA/quitosano. Os resultados mostraram a \n\nimpossibilidade de obter de um gel de quitosano suficientemente forte e est\u00e1vel mesmo \n\nquando a quantidade mais elevada de agentes de reticula\u00e7\u00e3o (0.5% em peso) foi adicionada \n\n\u00e0 solu\u00e7\u00e3o de quitosano, em contraste com o que aconteceu com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o do p\u00f3 de \n\nFastos\u00aeBG-Z4 na aus\u00eancia de outros agentes de reticula\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta descoberta permitiu \n\nconcluir que o Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 desempenha um papel activo na complexa\u00e7\u00e3o do quitosano. \n\nAs interac\u00e7\u00f5es positivas entre o quitosano e a superf\u00edcie das part\u00edculas do Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 \n\ne/ou as esp\u00e9cies i\u00f3nicas lixiviadas para a solu\u00e7\u00e3o precisam de ser melhor investigadas no \n\nfuturo.  \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\nAs caracter\u00edsticas microestruturais dos materiais porosos foram investigadas por \n\nmicroscopia electr\u00f3nica de varrimento (SEM), e a porosidade foi determinada pelo m\u00e9todo \n\nde substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol. As propriedades mec\u00e2nicas dos comp\u00f3sitos porosos imersos em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o (PBS) de solu\u00e7\u00e3o salina tamponada com fosfato foram investigadas atrav\u00e9s de \n\ntestes de compress\u00e3o/inchamento. Realizaram-se tamb\u00e9m testes de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o in vitro por \n\nimers\u00e3o das amostras na mesma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de PBS durante 2 meses, e o grau de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfoi avaliado atrav\u00e9s das altera\u00e7\u00f5es de peso sofridas pelas amostras. \n\nOs resultados mostraram algumas caracter\u00edsticas comuns entre o genipin e o \n\nglutaralde\u00eddo como agentes de reticula\u00e7\u00e3o: o aumento das quantidades adicionadas \n\n(0.01?0.5% em peso) levou a redu\u00e7\u00f5es no tempo de gelifica\u00e7\u00e3o, na frac\u00e7\u00e3o de porosidade, \n\nno grau de inchamento, e na taxa de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto o grau de reticula\u00e7\u00e3o aumentou. \n\nNo entanto, os seus efeitos sobre o tamanho dos poros e a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o dos \n\nsuportes porosos divergiram. O tamanho de poro diminuiu no caso do genipin, o que se \n\ntraduziu em consequentes aumentos da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o; enquanto o tamanho dos \n\nporos aumentou sempre com as quantidades adicionadas no caso do glutaralde\u00eddo, pelo que \n\ns\u00f3 foram registadas melhorias na resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o na gama de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es entre \n\n0.01?0.05% em peso, diminuindo quando a quantidade adicionada foi aumentada para 0,5 \n\n% em peso. \n\nVerificou-se ainda que a temperatura de ?20\u00baC era a que permitia obter as \n\nmicroestruturas porosas mais adequadas para as aplica\u00e7\u00f5es almejadas. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\nAcknowledgments

In some cases permanent prostheses may be used to \n\nrestore partial function to the injured organ. However, the artificial nature of prostheses \n\ncauses several problems, which are considered to be of less importance in comparison to \n\nregeneration of the injured organ. In order to overcome the limitations of transplantation \n\nand prosthesis, a new interdisciplinary field called tissue engineering was greatly \n\ndeveloped and artificial tissues and organs have been fabricated in vitro along the last two \n\ndecades [1] [2]. \n\nThe first tissue engineering definition was made in 1988 at National Science Foundation \n\nmeeting as \u201cThe application of the principles and methods of engineering and the life \n\nscience toward the fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in normal \n\nand pathological mammalian tissue and the development of biological substitutes to \n\nrestore, maintain or improve functions\u201d [3]. The innovative approach of tissue engineering \n\nis to seed isolated cells with tissue inducing substances, such as growth and differentiation \n\nfactors, on a scaffold which mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) and acts as a cell \n\nattachment, proliferating, migrating and functioning environment (Figure 1.1) [3]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  1.1. Diagram of tissue engineering approach [3]. \n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the principal methods in tissue engineering involves the use of porous scaffolds \n\nto support and guide the in-growth of cells. Tissue scaffolds must be biocompatible, \n\nbiodegradable, bioresorbable, and sterilizable. The scaffold must provide a number of \n\nproperties and functionalities, including: (i) enough mechanical strength in order to \n\nfacilitate in vitro handling and withstand the in vivo environment; (ii) sustaining cell \n\nfunction and provide an environment suitable for cellular growth; (iii) contain suitable \n\nsurface properties (wettability, stiffness, and compliance) to support cell attachment, \n\nproliferation and differentiation. The degradation products should be biocompatible, non-\n\ntoxic, and transportable out of the body [4]. Additionally, the pore architecture of scaffolds \n\nhas been shown to have a significant effect on physical properties and cellular activities. It \n\nhas been hypothesized that the pore diameter must be large enough to allow infiltration of \n\nthe cells towards the centre of the scaffold, whilst being small enough to present sufficient \n\nligand density for cellular attachment. The optimal pore size is dependent on both the cell \n\ntype and scaffold material [2]. Lee [5] proposed a minimum pore size of 150 ?m for hard \n\ntissue and 200\u2013250 ?m for soft tissue ingrowth. \n\n \n\n3-D matrix \n\nTissue-inducing \nsubstances \n\nIsolated, \nexpanded \n\ncells \n\nCell seeding Tissue formation \n\nIn vitro \n\nIn vivo \n\nWell plate with \ncell-polymer \n\nTransplantation \n\nBasic research \n\n\n\n4 Introduction \n \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n \n\nThe aims of this project are (a) developing 3D biodegradable composite porous \n\nscaffolds made of chitosan and bioactive glass (FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4) as guides for peripheral \n\nnervous tissue regeneration; (b) microstructural and mechanical characterization of the \n\nprepared scaffolds. For this purpose, Chitosan was dissolved in aqueous solutions of lactic \n\nacid (LA) to which powdered FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 bioactive glass was added together with \n\ndifferent amounts of crosslinking agents (glutaraldehyde and genipin) to reticulate the \n\nchitosan. The final mixtures were reticulated at suitable temperature and then frozen at two \n\ndifferent temperatures (?20\u00baC and ?80\u00baC) followed by freeze-drying to obtain porous \n\nscaffolds.  \n\nFor achieving the optimal chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 scaffolds, the dependence of the \n\nrheological properties of chitosan/LA solutions with fixed chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 ratio \n\n(50:50) and different amounts of cross-linking agents (0.01, 0.05, 0.5 wt.% related to the \n\ndry weight of chitosan) will be firstly investigated. The effects of cross-linking agents and \n\ntheir concentrations on gelation time, and on the physical and structural features of \n\nscaffolds (pore size, pore size distribution, compressive strength, swelling and degradation \n\nbehaviours) will be investigated. \n\n \n1.3  Thesis Outline \n \n\nThis dissertation consists of six chapters. The present chapter gives a short general \n\nintroduction to the theme, presents the main objectives of this research work, and outlines \n\nthe content of the different parts of the document. The second chapter gives a detailed \n\naccount about the state of the arte in this specific area of human nervous system, nerve \n\ninjuries and regeneration materials/approaches. The starting materials and reagents, the \n\nexperimental procedures used in the fabrication of the polymeric/composite 3D porous \n\nscaffolds and for assessment their relevant properties are described in chapter 3. The \n\nexperimental results obtained are presented and discussed in chapter 4. Chapter 5 \n\nsummarises the findings and the main conclusions that could be drawn from all \n\nexperiments. Chapter 6 indicates research directions to further explore the most exciting \n\naspects of the present work. Finally, the document ends with a list of updated bibliographic \n\nreferences cited along the text.  \n\n\n\nState of The Art 5 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2 Chapter 2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nState of The Art \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n2.1 Nerve Tissue, Injuries and Regeneration \n\n \n\nThe human nervous system is classified into two systems, central nervous system (CNS) \n\nand the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain, spinal cord, optic, \n\nolfactory and auditory systems. Peripheral nerves are cord-like structures containing \n\nbundles of nerve fibres that carry information from regions of the body to the spinal cord \n\n(and vice versa). Peripheral nerves have a tough outer layer of connective tissue that \n\nsurrounds discrete groups of miniscule fibres, called \u201caxons,\u201d each originating from its \n\nown nerve cell (Figure 2.1) [6] [7].  \n\nEndoneurium surrounds individual axons and their Schwann cell sheaths and is \n\ncomposed predominantly of oriented collagen fibres. Next, the perineurium, formed from \n\nmany layers of flattened cells (i.e., fibroblasts) and collagen, surrounds groups of axons to \n\nform fascicles. Finally, epineurium, an outer sheath of loose fibrocollagenous tissue, binds \n\nindividual nerve fascicles into a nerve trunk [6] [7]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  2.1. Anatomical overview of the PNS [6]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nState of The Art 7 \n\n \n \n\nThe spinal cord is composed of dendrites, axons, and cell bodies (Figure  2.2). The \n\ncentre of the spinal cord, a butterfly-shaped region referred to as grey matter, contains the \n\ncell bodies of excitatory neurons, as well as glial cells and blood vessels. The grey matter \n\nis surrounded by white matter, which helps to protect and insulate the spinal cord. White \n\nmatter consists of axons and glial cells [6] [7]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  2.2. Figure Anatomy overview of the spinal cord [1]. \n\n \n\n \n\nInjuries in the central nervous system have only a very limited capacity to heal, because \n\nnerve regeneration tends not to occur. In contrast, peripheral nerves have a remarkable \n\ncapacity for regeneration. Even completely severed peripheral nerves, if repaired promptly, \n\ncan regrow, allowing the patients to enjoy complete or nearly complete recovery in many \n\ncases [6] [7]. \n\nPeripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged. A peripheral nerve, when severed, is \n\ncapable of a significant amount of regeneration. Peripheral nerves are discrete trunks filled \n\n\n\n8 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nwith sensory and motor axons, and support a number of cell types, such as Schwann cells \n\nand fibroblasts [6] [7]. The peripheral nerve trunk can be considered as a protective \n\nstructure for axons. The most popular approach in peripheral nerve tissue engineering \n\ninvolves in vivo implantation of artificial scaffolds and substrates that will guide naturally \n\nregenerating axons to the distal segment.  \n\nAs described by Seddon in 1975 [8], there are three different classifications for \n\nperipheral nerve injuries: (1) neuropraxia which is the lowest degree of nerve injury in \n\nwhich the nerve remains intact but signalling ability is damaged, (2) axonotmesis which is \n\nthe second class in which the axon is damaged but the surrounding connecting tissue \n\nremains intact, (3) neurotmesis or transection injuries where the nerve trunk is completely \n\ninterrupted, especially those resulting in large neural gaps, may have a devastating impact \n\non patients, quality of life, and in these cases reconstructive surgery is required as a \n\ntherapeutic management to achieve nerve regeneration and function restoration. In \n\nconsequence, peripheral nerve repair represents a unique challenge and opportunity to \n\nclinical and translational neurosciences [9]. \n\n \n\n2.2 Current Clinical Approaches for Treating Nerve Injuries \n\n \n\nIt is commonly accepted that physical guidance of axons is a vital component of nerve \n\nrepair. In 1960s, Millesi [6] determined that the use of nerve grafts reduced tension on the \n\ndamaged nerves in many cases and further enhanced functional recovery. Later research \n\ndemonstrated that biochemical signals as well as physical guidance are critical for nerve \n\nregeneration [7]. \n\nFor peripheral nerve injury, treatment typically consists of either direct end-to-end \n\nsuture of the damaged nerve ends (Figure  2.3) or the use of an autologous nerve graft. \n\nPerforming an end-to-end suture can repair small defects or gaps in the nerve. For longer \n\nnerve gaps, this surgical approach would induce tension of the suture site, inhibiting the \n\nnerve regeneration and promoting necrosis of the nerve stumps. Thus, for a larger nerve \n\ndefect, an autologous nerve graft that is harvested from another site in the body is used to \n\nspan the injury site. Disadvantages of this technique include loss of function at the donor \n\n\n\nState of The Art 9 \n\n \n \n\nsite, the need for multiple surgeries and the differences between the donor and the receptor \n\nnerve diameter, compromising the nerve regeneration [6]. \n\nFor central nervous system injury, and particularly spinal cord injury, clinical treatment \n\nis less promising. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment available to restore nerve \n\nfunction. After swelling from the injury subsides, patients begin a long period of \n\nrehabilitation during which time they train remaining nerves to compensate for the loss due \n\nto injury [1] [3]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.3. Perineural end-to-end suture of the peripheral nerve fascicles after a neurotmesis injury [6]. \n\n \n \n\n2.3 Challenges and Bioengineering Strategies for Nerve Repair \n\n \n\nIn the PNS, the challenge is to find an alternative to the autologous nerve graft and thus \n\neliminate the need for two surgeries and the removal of tissue from the patient. Thus, \n\nbioengineering strategies for the PNS have focused on developing alternative treatments to \n\nthe nerve graft (e.g., nerve guidance channels), especially for larger defects, and improving \n\nrecovery rates and functional outcome. Many researchers are presently focusing efforts on \n\ncreating physical or chemical pathways for regenerating axons [6] [7]. \n\nThe CNS is a greater challenge for new therapies. The ability of spinal nerves to \n\nregenerate was not decisively shown until 1980, and it was not until after this time that \n\nresearch in this area rapidly developed. In addition, results from various studies have been \n\ncontroversial and complicated. These challenges provide fertile ground for the \n\ndevelopment of therapies and devices to enhance regeneration [6].  \n\n\n\n10 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n2.4 Neural Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nNerve tissue engineering (NTE) offers great opportunities to neuroscientists and \n\nsurgeons who have been collaborating to develop tissue engineered nerve grafts [9]. It is \n\none of the most promising methods in biomedical engineering for restoring central nerve \n\nsystems in humans and for repairing or replacing the function of defective or damaged \n\ntissues or organs. Nerve tissue repair is a prized treatment concept in human health care, \n\nbecause it has a direct impact on the quality of life [10]. Tissue engineered nerve grafts are \n\ntypically composed of a physical scaffold with the introduction of support cells and/or \n\ngrowth factors or other biomolecular components [9]. \n\n \n\n2.5 Neural Scaffolds \n \n\nThe physical scaffold of tissue engineered nerve grafts, shortly called the neural \n\nscaffold, serves to: (1) direct axons sprouting from the proximal to distal nerve stump; (2) \n\nmaintain adequate mechanical support for the regenerating nerve fibres; (3) provide a \n\nconduit channel for the diffusion of neurotropic and neurotrophic factors secreted by the \n\nproximal nerve stump and a conduit wall for the exchange of nutrients and waste products; \n\n(4) obviate the infiltration of fibrous scar tissue that hinders axonal regeneration; and (5) \n\ncreate an optimal microenvironment (niche) for nerve regeneration through the \n\naccumulation and release of exogenous and endogenous biochemical effects. For the sake \n\nof clinical use, the neural scaffold is hoped to be easy to fabricate and sterilize, and simple \n\nto implant in the body by microsurgical techniques. Up to now, a diverse array of natural \n\nor synthetic biomaterials, together with well-defined fabrication techniques, has been tried \n\nto prepare neural scaffolds that possess different structures, in which tubular nerve \n\nguidance conduit (NGC) is the basic structure [9].  \n\n \n\n2.5.1 Requirements of an Ideal Scaffold \n\n \n\nAn ideal neural scaffold has to satisfy many biological and physicochemical \n\nrequirements, among which biocompatibility, biodegradability, permeability, \n\n\n\nState of The Art 11 \n\n \n \n\nbiomechanical properties, and surface properties are the major concerns. These required \n\nproperties are mainly determined by the scaffold material and scaffold structure [9].  \n\nFigure  2.4 shows the various characteristics desired for an ideal scaffold for neural \n\nregeneration [10]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  2.4. Ideal properties of a scaffold for neural regeneration [10]. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.1 Biocompatibility \n \n\nThe biocompatibility of neural scaffolds can be evaluated from three important aspects: \n\n(i) blood compatibility, (ii) histocompatibility, and (iii) mechanical compatibility. Blood \n\ncompatibility requires that the scaffold in contact with blood does not induce hemolysis, or \n\ndestroy blood components, or lead to coagulation and thrombus formation. \n\nHistocompatibility means that the scaffold has no toxic side effects on the surrounding \n\ntissues, especially neither teratogenicity nor gene mutation, while the surrounding tissues, \n\nin turn, do not induce corrosive effects or immune rejection on the scaffold.

The tuneable degradation kinetics should match the rate of nerve \n\nregeneration. The ideal neural scaffold should remain intact for the time axons need to \n\nregenerate across the nerve gap and then degrade gradually with minimal swelling and \n\nforeign body reaction [9]. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.3 Permeability \n \n\nAs a soft tissue engineered product, a neural scaffold must have a sufficient \n\npermeability for nutrient and gas exchange, including the exchange of fluids between the \n\nregeneration environment and the surrounding tissues, avoiding the build-up of pressure \n\ndue to fluid retention. Different fabrication techniques affect the permeability by altering \n\nthe porous structure of neural scaffolds, and hydrophilic property of the scaffold material is \n\nanother critical factor responsible for the permeability of neural scaffolds [9]. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.4 Biomechanical Properties \n \n\nSufficient mechanical strength needs to be considered when designing ideal neural \n\nscaffolds. A neural scaffold must be flexible to allow bending without kinking as well. It is \n\nimportant to make the right balance between the flexibility and hardness, because too stiff \n\nscaffolds are easy to cause dislocation, and too flexible scaffolds fail to support axonal \n\nregeneration [9] [11]. \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Materials Used for Neural Scaffolds \n \n\nTable 2.1 provides a summary of materials in use or under investigation for nerve repair \n\napplications [6] [7]. \n\n\n\nState of The Art 13 \n\n \n \n\nTable  2.1.Nerve grafts and nerve conduit materials [6] [7]. \n\nAutologous tissue grafts \n1.

Gore-Tex or ePTFE \n\n\n\n14 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n2.5.2.1 Natural Polymers \n\n \n\nThe selection of biomaterials is very important for the fabrication of neural scaffolds. A \n\nwide variety of biomaterials has been attempted, which are of either natural or synthetic \n\norigin. Natural polymers, such as chitosan, alginate, and especially collagen and fibrin, due \n\nto their structural similarity with the neural structure, and properties such as cell \n\nattachment, growth and proliferation, have more advantages than synthetic polymers, but \n\ntheir low mechanical properties and their tendency to swell is still a problem to overcome \n\nto foster the widespread use of such materials. However, designs with small nerve gaps \n\nhave been responsive [12] [13]. Biodegradable nerve guides must be preferred since no \n\nforeign body material will be left in the host after the device has fulfilled its task [12]. \n\n \n\n2.5.2.1.1 Collagen and Other ECM Components \n\n \n\nCollagen is the major component of the extracellular matrix and is known to promote \n\ncellular proliferation and tissue healing. Among the most promising biomimetic \n\nbiomaterials for nerve regeneration, collagen proved to lead to functional recovery similar \n\nto nerve autografts in experimental animal models. Conduits derived from biologic \n\nmolecules like collagen have demonstrated improved regeneration [14] [15]. Gelatin, \n\nderived from denatured collagen, is also the first biodegradable material examined for \n\npreparing neural scaffolds. Other ECM molecule-derived materials, for example, laminin \n\nand fibronectin, are also used for the fabrication of neural scaffolds [9].  \n\n \n\n2.5.2.1.2 Alginate \n\n \n\nAlginate, commonly purified from seaweed, is a naturally occurring copolymer [9]. \n\nPrang et al. [16] have assessed the capacity of alginate gels to promote directed axonal \n\nregrowth in the injured mammalian central nervous system. The alginate scaffolds also \n\npromoted adult peripheral nerve survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This was \n\nthe first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic-structured capillary gels, so \n\n\n\nState of The Art 15 \n\n \n \n\nfurther studies are needed to investigate the long-term physical stability of the alginate \n\nscaffolds, because central nervous system axon regeneration can take many months to \n\noccur. \n\n \n\n2.5.2.1.3 Polysialic Acid \n\n \n\nPolysialic acid (PSA) is a relatively new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for \n\nartificial nerve conduit. PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for \n\ndegradation induced by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved \n\nin steering processes like neuritogenesis axonal path finding, and neuroblast migration. \n\nAnimals (adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats) with PSA genetically knocked out express a \n\nlethal phenotype which has unsuccessful path finding, ie, the nerves connecting the two \n\nbrain hemispheres are aberrant or missing. Thus, PSA is vital for proper nervous system \n\ndevelopment [12]. \n\n \n\n2.5.2.1.4 Chitin and Chitosan \n\n \n\nChitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide found in nature next to cellulose, and \n\ncan be isolated from the outer shell of crustaceans, insect exoskeletons, and fungal cell \n\nwalls. Chitin is extensively applied in a wide range of biomedical fields [9]. Chitins and \n\nmodified chitins exert a number of beneficial actions, such as: (1) they stimulate \n\nmacrophages by interacting with receptors on the macrophage surface (2) they stimulate \n\nmacrophages to produce cytokines and other compounds that confer nonspecific host \n\nresistance against bacterial and viral infections, and antitumor activity [17]. The ideal \n\nstructure of chitin is a linear polysaccharide of ? (1?4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-\n\nglucopyranose, where all residues are comprised entirely of N-acetyl-glucosamine residues \n\nare fully acetylated. The ideal structure of chitosan, the principal derivative of chitin, is a \n\nlinear polymer of ? (1?4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, where all residues are \n\ncomprised entirely of N-glucosamine residues or are fully deacetylated. Figure  2.5 is \n\nshowing the ideal chemical representation of chitin and chitosan [18]. \n\n\n\n16 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.5. Ideal chemical representation of chitin and chitosan [18]. \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, the traditional sources of chitin and chitosan are not in fact 100% acetylated \n\nor deacetylated. They exist as a co-polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine, as \n\nrepresented in Figure  2.6. The difference between chitin and chitosan is their acetyl \n\ncontent. Chitin is made up of more than 50% (more commonly 70-90%) acetamido groups \n\nwhile chitosan commonly having 70-90% amino groups. The main parameters influencing \n\nthe chemical characteristics of chitosan are its degree of acetylation that could be within \n\nthe range of 30-95%, and molecular weight, which can vary from 300 to over 1000 kDa \n\n[18] [19] [20]. \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure  2.6. Chemical structural representation of chitin and chitosan illustrating the copolymer \n\ncharacter of the biopolymers [18]. \n\n\n\nState of The Art 17 \n\n \n \n\nChitosan is highly bioactive, biodegradable and biocompatible; so, it is widely used in \n\nbiomedical applications, such as skin substitutes, wound healing, nerve regeneration, gene \n\ndelivery, cartilage and bone tissue regeneration [18]. Chitosan has quite positive effects on \n\nthe nerve regeneration. It has been showed that when chitosan is used, it facilitates nerve \n\nhealing and improves the nerve differentiation and growth. It also shows antifungal, \n\nantitumoral, anticholesteremic, antibacterial and antimicrobial characteristics because the \n\ncationic moieties of chitosan molecules can interact with anionic cell wall of \n\nbacteria/micro-organisms and rupture their cell wall that reduces the bacteria attachment \n\nand survivability [20] [21] [22]. \n\nChitosan is insoluble in neutral or basic pH solutions, but soluble in acidic solutions (&lt;\n\npH 6.5), because of presence of primary amine groups which make chitosan a cationic \n\npolyelectrolyte (pKa ~ 6.5) and allow it to be coupled covalently to the various \n\nbiomolecules, along with its other primary and secondary hydroxyl functional groups [21] \n\n[23]. \n\n \n\n2.5.2.2 Synthetic Polymers  \n\n \n\nIn addition to naturally derived biopolymers, synthetic polymers constitute another class \n\nof promising biomaterials for fabricating neural scaffolds due to their tuneable chemical \n\nand physical properties [9].  \n\nSynthetic materials are attractive because their chemical and physical properties (e.g., \n\ndegradation rate, porosity, mechanical strength) can be specifically optimized for a \n\nparticular application [7] [12]. In some cases, synthetic biomaterials are cheaper than \n\nnatural ones, can be produced in larger quantities with uniform properties and have longer \n\nshelf life [11]. However, the biocompatibility of synthetic materials poses a challenge \n\nbecause the body\u2019s inflammatory response can vary considerably from one material to \n\nanother. In addition, some synthetic materials that are tolerated by the body\u2019s immune \n\nsystem are unfortunately incompatible with cell adhesion and tissue repair. These materials \n\nare often modified to render them more \u201ccell friendly\u201d [7] [12]. \n\n\n\n18 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nTo select an appropriate synthetic material, there are several general properties that all \n\nnerve guidance channels should possess: (1) they must be readily formed into a conduit \n\nwith desired dimensions, (2) they must be sterilizable, (3) they must be tear resistant, and \n\n(4) they must be easy to handle and suture. Permanent materials pose a higher risk for \n\ninfection, are more likely to provoke a chronic inflammatory response, and have the \n\npotential to compress the nerve over time. Thus, a nerve guide that degrades as the nerve \n\nregenerates is preferred. Additionally, guidance channels should be pliable, but should \n\nmaintain their shape and resist collapse during implantation and over the time course for \n\nregeneration. Research has also shown that guidance channels should be semipermeable \n\nand should have a smooth inner wall. Properties of the ideal nerve guidance channel are \n\nshown in Figure  2.7 [7] [12]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  2.7. Properties of the ideal nerve guidance channel [7]. \n\n \n\n \n\nSo the factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, \n\nmechanical integrity and controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization \n\n[12]. \n\n \n\n\n\nState of The Art 19 \n\n \n \n\n2.5.2.2.1 Non-absorbable Synthetic Polymers \n\n \n\nBeginning in the early 1980s, replacement surgery using artificial nerve conduits made \n\nfrom non-absorbable materials, such as silicone Figure  2.8), has been in use for the \n\ntreatment of severed nerves. All these reports, however, are of studies demonstrating \n\nrecovery in morphologic continuity of a nerve with an extremely small gap of about 10 \n\nmm in small laboratory animals, and recovery of motor function has rarely been achieved. \n\nThe outcome is in no way superior to that of nerve autografting in any of the reported \n\nstudies. Elastomer hydrogels or porous stainless steel has also been used for nerve \n\nregeneration. However, these artificial materials have the disadvantages of engendering \n\nchronic foreign body reaction due to scar tissue formation, inflexibility, and lack of \n\nstability [12] [14]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.8. Silicone tube for nerve regeneration after a neurotmesis injury [12]. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n2.5.2.2.2 Absorbable Synthetic Polymers  \n\n \n\nIt became recognized from the latter half of the 1980s onwards that degradable-\n\nabsorbable materials are preferable in the body after attaining nerve regeneration. With the \n\nprogress in material synthesis and bridging techniques, artificial nerve guides made of \n\nabsorbable synthetic materials, have been developed. Substances such as polyglycolic acid \n\n(PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxybutyrate are under investigation as \n\nbiodegradable-absorbable synthetic materials for nerve regeneration [12] [14]. Khorasani \n\net al. [24] have designed PLLA tubes for nerve regeneration and studied cellular \n\ninvestigations and in vitro assessments. These polymers are brittle, and they do not have \n\nregions permissible for chemical modification. In addition, they degrade by bulk rather \n\nthan by surface, which is not a smooth and ideal degradation process. In an attempt to \n\novercome the lack of functionality, free amines have been incorporated into their structures \n\nfrom which peptides can be tethered to control cell attachment and behaviour. Other \n\nbiodegradable poly(esters), such as poly(caprolactones), have also demonstrated promise \n\nfor nerve regeneration applications. In addition to poly(esters), biodegradable poly \n\n(urethane), poly(organo phosphazene), methacrylate-based hydrogels, and poly(3-\n\nhydroxybutyrate) have shown a capacity for guiding regeneration. Biodegradable glass \n\ntubes have also been studied, but results of pre-clinical studies have not been optimistic \n\n[12] [14]. \n\n \n\n2.5.2.3 Composite Nerve Guides \n\n \n\nComposite scaffold materials can be designed from both synthetic and natural polymers \n\nembedding particles of bioactive and biodegradable inorganic components such as calcium \n\nphosphates or bioglasses.  \n\nClinically, type I collagen conduits [25], chitosan [26] [27] [28] and polyphosphoesters \n\nsuch as poly (DL-lactide\u2013caprolactone) [29] [30] are popular resorbable biomaterials used \n\nin nerve tissue repair. However, there is significant scope for improvement with these \n\nmaterials.  \n\n\n\nState of The Art 21 \n\n \n \n\nIn addition to materials which can interact with the body to improve regeneration, it is \n\nrequired to make a balance among mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and controlled \n\ndegradability. Accordingly, composite materials offer significant opportunities for \n\ninvestigation [31]. Composites that have combined biodegradable polymers and bioactive \n\ninorganic phases such as hydroxyapatite (HA) [32] [33], ?-TCP [34] [35] or bioactive glass \n\n[36] [37] [38] have resulted in resorbable scaffolds with tailored biocompatibility and \n\nimproved physical and mechanical properties, especially in hard tissue regeneration. \n\nAdditionally, some of degradation by-products can be clinically beneficial. So, composite \n\nmaterials, if properly designed and optimized, may allow the development of scaffolds \n\nwith tailored physical, biological and mechanical properties to suitably match the \n\napplication of peripheral nerve repair [31]. \n\nGuidance of developing axons involves turning of the motile tip, the growth cone [39], \n\nand is dependent on extracellular cues, including ionic messengers. Divalent calcium ion \n\n(Ca2+) is the most widely used messenger which regulates turning (guidance) and extension \n\nof the growth cone [40] [41]. Zinc (Zn2+) is the second most existing trace element in the \n\nhuman body and is required for normal growth and correct immune function [42], it is also \n\nan effective antibacterial agent [43]. It has also been suggested that Zn2+ may be a valuable \n\nspecific therapy for uremic polyneuropathy and nerve development [42]. From a material \n\nviewpoint, the synthesis of degradable bioglasses containing these elements is a possible \n\nway to release controlled levels of these therapeutic ions in controlled levels is possible via \n\nthe synthesis of degradable bioglasses containing these elements [44] [ [45]. Therefore, \n\ncombining such bioglasses with polymers appears as a quite promising strategy to enhance \n\nthe mechanical properties of the scaffolds and their biological responses in vivo.  \n\nBioactive materials elicit an appropriate biological response when implanted in vivo, \n\nenabling the formation of bonds between materials and surrounding tissues. Bioactive \n\nglasses are commonly described as ideal materials for bone tissue regeneration due to their \n\nability to promote osteointegration, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and promotion \n\nof growth factor [46]. Bioactive glasses have been used in biological applications since \n\nHench described their use the early 70s. There have been interesting research works about \n\nbioactive glasses in science and biomedical applications over the last two decades, as \n\nevidenced by the growing number of publications in this field [47]. Bioactive glasses have \n\nshown tailored therapeutic ion release, primarily in hard tissues. However, as described \n\n\n\n22 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nbefore, controlled degradation and release of therapeutic ions from these biomaterials may \n\nalso play an important role in soft tissue regeneration such as repairing of peripheral nerve \n\ngaps [44]. There has been relatively little research on the application of bioactive glasses \n\non repairing of peripheral nerve gaps. According to Buting et al. [36], fibres of Bioglass\u00ae \n\n45S5 can form a biocompatible scaffold to guide re-growing peripheral axons in vivo. \n\nKehoe [31] has successfully designed a nerve guidance conduit consists of PLGA (lactic to \n\nglycolic acid mole ratio, 75:25) and a zinc-silicate based bioactive glass and evaluated the \n\ncytotoxicity and mechanical properties of conduit. Zhang et al. [44] have designed silica-\n\nbased glasses (Si\u2013Na\u2013Ca\u2013Zn\u2013Ce system) and investigated composition-structure-property \n\nrelationships in these systems with respect to their potential use as fillers in polymeric \n\n(PLGA) composite constructs for peripheral nerve regeneration. They have evaluated the \n\nCa2+ and Zn2+ release profile for this purpose. Release of such elements, at appropriate \n\nlevels, from peripheral nerve guidance conduits may be advantageous with respect to the \n\nrepair of peripheral nerve discontinuities. \n\nGoel et al. [45] have designed and developed alkali-free series of bioactive glasses in \n\nthe glass system CaO\u2013MgO\u2013SiO2\u2013P2O5\u2013CaF2 along the diopside (CaMgSi2O6)\u2013\n\nfluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F)\u2013TCP (3CaO.P2O5) join. FastOs\u00aeBG is a common designation for \n\nthese developed bioactive glasses, which can be doped with some other elements such as \n\nSr, Zn, Mn, etc. It was demonstrated that these glasses exhibit high rate of in vitro \n\nbioactivity, but detailed in vitro cell culture and in vivo tests need to be carried out on this \n\nbioactive glass in order to prove their efficacy for application in human biomedicine. On \n\nthe other hand, the bioactive glasses having high alkali metal content (sodium and \n\npotassium) are sensitive to water uptake resulting in swelling and cracking of the polymer \n\nmatrix embedding them in composites [48]. So, it can be concluded that by using these \n\nalkali-free bioactive glasses embedded in polymer matrix, the rate of swelling and \n\ndegradation of composites can be controlled which is important in nerve tissue \n\nregeneration. In fact, the resistance to deformation determines whether the conduit can be \n\nused in vivo due to the various stresses from the surrounding tissue while the resistance to \n\nswelling protects the regenerated nerve axons from being compressed by the conduit wall. \n\nThe swelling should be moderate [49] [50]. \n\nRecently, chitosan-based nerve conduits extensively developed to bridge large \n\nperipheral nerve gaps have achieved considerable success [50] [51] [52] [53] [54]. \n\n\n\nState of The Art 23 \n\n \n \n\nHowever, there is currently no research using the combination of chitosan and \n\nFastOs\u00aeBG in nerve tissue repair. Thus, in this study, novel biodegradable composite \n\nmembranes based on chitosan and FastOs\u00aeBG doped with 4 mol% Zn (FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4) \n\nwere synthesized aiming at nerve regeneration applications. It is hypothesized that \n\nFastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 particles will improve the mechanical properties of the membranes to resist \n\nmuscular contractions and maintain a stable support structure to provide space for nerve \n\nregeneration. It is also expected that the controlled ionic release from FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 will \n\nassist in nerve regeneration and in preventing oxidative stress [45].  \n\n \n\n2.6 Cross-linked Chitosan Scaffolds \n\n \n\nFor generating chitosan scaffolds, the polymer has to be cross-linked to raise its \n\nstability. Cross-linking treatments are split into two groups: chemical cross-linking and \n\nbiophysical cross-linking. Chemical methods include the use of various chemical reagents, \n\nwhereas biophysical methods include the use of UV light and dehydrothermal cross-\n\nlinking [2].  \n\nChitosan can be cross-linked either ionically or covalently. As ionic cross-linkers, \n\npolyanions like triphosphate, citrate or natural polymers like hyaluronic acid or chondroitin \n\nsulphate are used. In this connection the polyanion can interact with chitosan via \n\nelectrostatic forces to form an ionic cross-linked network. The other possibility is a \n\ncovalently formed network with the amino and hydroxy-groups of chitosan reacting with \n\nfunctional groups of cross-linker molecules. Covalently cross-linked networks can be \n\nformed by genipin, di- or polyaldehydes (glutaraldehyde, oxidised starch and oxidised \n\ncylcodextrin). Also, carboxylic acids, azides, epoxides, diisocyanates and silanes are \n\ncompounds that have been used as covalent cross-linkers [55] [56]. \n\n \n\n2.6.1 Glutaraldehyde \n\n \n\nGlutaraldehyde (GT) is one of the most popular cross-linking treatments for biological \n\ntissues. It is a bifunctional cross-linker, which reacts with chitosan via either a Schiff base \n\n\n\n24 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nreaction, leading to imine functionality (Figure  2.9), and/or through Michael-type adducts \n\nwith terminal aldehydes, leading to the formation of carbonyl groups. Although being \n\nwidely used, GT mediated cross-linking is often cited as being undesirable as it introduces \n\ncytotoxic aldehyde molecules [57] [58]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.9. The chemical structure of GT-cross-linked chitosan [57]. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Genipin \n\n \n\nGenipin (GP) (Figure  2.10) can be obtained from its parent compound, geniposide, \n\nwhich is isolated from the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS. GP and its related iridoid \n\nglucosides have been widely used as antiphlogistics and cholagogues in herbal medicine. It \n\nhas been used as a cross-linking agent for the fixation of biological tissues as \n\nbioprostheses. It can react spontaneously with amino acids or proteins to form dark blue \n\npigments. GP is about 5000?10,000 times less cytotoxic than glutaraldehyde [59] [60] \n\n[61]. \n\n \n\n\n\nState of The Art 25 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.10. Schematic of GP chemical structure [60]. \n\n \n \n\nMi et al. [62] have shown that cross-linking of chitosan membrane using GP reduced its \n\ntensile strain, swelling ratio and enzymatic degradability. According to Chiono et al. [63], \n\nchitosan/gelatin blends cross-linked with optimal additions of GP were able to support \n\nneuroblastoma cell adhesion and proliferation, and cross-linking degree increased with \n\nincreasing the GP amount as a result of higher water stability and mechanical stiffness. \n\nSung [64] has shown that differences in cross-linking structure may affect the mechanical \n\nproperties and the bonding characteristics of the graphs to living tissues. \n\n \n\n2.7 Fabrication Techniques for Nerve Guidance Conduit \n\n \n\nTo more accurately mimic natural repair in the body, recent studies have focused on the \n\nuse of various advanced approaches to create complex guidance channels and to combine \n\nmultiple stimuli into a single therapy. With regard to advanced guidance channel \n\nfabrication, most techniques have focused on creating intricate internal structures that more \n\naccurately mimic the nerve architecture, such as the inclusion of fibres and channels to \n\nguide individual nerve fibres. In general, researchers have attempted to improve the neural \n\nscaffold properties by several novel fabricating techniques such as magnetic polymer fibre \n\nalignment, injection moulding, solid free-form fabrication, ink-jet polymer printing, \n\nnanofibre self-assembly, solvent casting and particulate leaching, gas foaming, \n\nemulsification/freeze-drying, liquid-liquid phase separation, electrospinning, incorporating \n\nnerve growth factors in the scaffold and improving the wettability of the scaffold surface \n\nby surface modifications [10] [14]. Each technique is briefly described below. \n\n\n\n26 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\n2.7.1 Magnet Alignment and Injection Moulding \n\n \n\nNerve guidance channels have been predominantly fabricated as hollow tubes or as \n\nporous foam rods because of the ease in manufacturing these devices. For hollow tubes, it \n\nis known that the body normally generates an oriented fibrin matrix after placement of a \n\nhollow conduit across a nerve defect, which serves as a critical precursor to axonal \n\nregeneration. With regard to foam rods, it is questionable whether an amorphous irregular \n\nstructure optimally guides axonal regeneration. Thus, to mimic natural repair in the body \n\nand to shorten the time required for regeneration, more recent studies have focused on the \n\nmodification of nerve guidance channels with internal matrices of longitudinally aligned \n\nfibres or channels. These devices often require more advanced processing techniques. As a \n\nmeans to provide the necessary matrix alignment and also improve upon processing \n\nconditions, magnetic fields have been used to orient protein polymers. In a different \n\napproach, a novel foam-processing technique, utilizing low-pressure injection moulding, \n\ncreated highly porous conduits from PLGA with continuous longitudinal channels [10]. \n\n \n\n2.7.2 Phase Separation \n\n \n\nWhen using phase separation, a porous structure can be easily obtained by adjusting \n\nthermodynamic and kinetic parameters. However, because of the complexity of the \n\nprocessing variables involved in the phase separation technique, the pore structure cannot \n\nbe easily controlled. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain large pores, which may exhibit a \n\nlack of interconnectivity [65]. \n\n \n\n2.7.3 Gas Foaming \n\n \n\nGas foaming has the advantage of room temperature processing but produces a largely \n\nnonporous outer skin layer and a mixture of open and closed pores within the centre, \n\nleaving incomplete interconnectivity. The main disadvantages of the gas foaming is that it \n\noften results in a non-connected cellular structure within the scaffold [66]. \n\n\n\nState of The Art 27 \n\n \n \n\n2.7.4 Solvent Casting \n\n \n\nSolvent casting is a combination with particulate leaching method, which involves the \n\ncasting of a mixture of monomers and initiator solution and a porogen in a mould, termed \n\npolymerization, followed by leaching-out of the porogen with the proper solvent to \n\ngenerate the pores. It is inexpensive but still has to overcome some disadvantages in order \n\nto find engineering applications as structures that facilitate either tissue regeneration or \n\nrepair during reconstructive operations [66].  \n\n \n\n2.7.5 Freeze Drying \n\n \n\nFreeze drying technique is based upon the principle of sublimation to fabricate porous \n\nscaffolds. The typical process would be to dissolve the polymer into a solvent in order to \n\nform a solution of desired concentration. Then the solution is frozen and solvent will be \n\nremoved by lyophilisation under a high vacuum. In this method, the pore size and porous \n\nstructure can be controlled by the freezing rate, pH, and temperature. However, the small \n\npore size formed in this technique is a concern for some applications and also the time \n\nconsuming lyophilisation step [1].  \n\nGenerally, the freeze-drying process can be split into two parts: freezing and drying. \n\nDuring freezing the temperature of the solution is lowered and a phase change occurs, \n\nwhere liquid water is converted into ice crystals. The cooling rate is an important aspect of \n\nthe freezing cycle because it affects the ice crystal formation during freezing. Fast rates of \n\ncooling have a tendency to produce many small ice crystals. These crystals may not be \n\ncontinuous, but they are generally homogeneously distributed throughout the frozen \n\nsolution. A slow rate of freezing will result in a more connected ice crystal structure with \n\nlarger crystals [2]. \n\nSo, to produce large ice crystals, the freezing temperature should be as high as possible \n\nand the time for crystallization should be extended. To produce smaller crystals, freezing \n\nshould take place under low temperature conditions and the freezing rate should be high in \n\norder to reduce the time available for ice crystals to grow [67].  \n\n\n\n28 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nThe next step in the process is drying in which heat is added to the material under a \n\nvacuum. Under these conditions the ice crystals are sublimated from the solute. The \n\nsublimated water vapour is then trapped on a condenser, and the process is complete [2]. \n\nWith freeze drying system, two kinds of biomaterials with different properties can be \n\ncombined to produce scaffold structures with good biocompatibility in the inner layer and \n\nwith the desired mechanical strength protruded by the outer layer. The forming precision is \n\nhigh, the wall thickness can be controlled, and a tight connection between the two layers \n\ncan be achieved [66]. \n\nBoth homogeneous aqueous solutions and heterogeneous dispersions can be frozen and \n\nfreeze-dried to prepare materials with relatively disordered macroporous structures. \n\nAlternatively, the freezing process can be performed in a more controlled manner to \n\norientate the growth of the ice crystals in one direction. Zhang et al. [67] have described \n\ndevelopments in the use of directional freezing techniques to produce porous materials \n\nwhere the orientation of the crystal growth defines the pore structure. They outline how \n\nthese methods can produce complex composite materials with a range of aligned pore \n\narchitectures. Figure  2.11 shows a schematic diagram of the directional freezing process. \n\nIce crystals grow from the bottom [67].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  2.11. Scheme showing the directional freezing process [67]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nState of The Art 29 \n\n \n \n\nParticles and polymeric molecules are excluded from the ice and aggregate between the \n\ngrowing ice crystals. After the freezing is complete, removal of the orientated ice by freeze \n\ndrying leads to the formation of aligned structures. \n\n \n\n2.7.6 Electrospinning \n\n \n\nElectrospinning is a simple, unique, and efficient method which has the possibility of \n\nproducing ultrafine multicomposite fibres with spatial orientation and nanodimensions \n\nwith high surface area and controlled pore geometry [68]. A polymer solution or melt is \n\ndrawn from a nozzle by applying a force of gravity or mechanical pressure combined with \n\nan electric field of high voltage (10\u201320 kV). When the electric charge overcomes the \n\nsurface tension of the polymer solution droplet, a polymer jet is sprouted, followed by \n\nsolvent evapouration which forms the solid nanofibres [69]. The properties of the \n\nelectrospun fibres such as the diameter, orientation, and porosity influence cell adhesion, \n\nproliferation and processes such as the transportation of nutrients (e.g. metabolites, \n\noxygen) to and from the cells. The orientation of fibres within the engineered scaffold play \n\nan important role in mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM) because many tissues in the \n\nbody (e.g., endothelial and nerve cells) have regular oriented architecture, which is \n\nstrongly correlated to their distinguished mechanical properties and particular functions. \n\nThese described factors should be considered while designing and fabricating engineered \n\nscaffolds for nerve tissue engineering [68]. \n\n \n\n2.7.7 Solid Freeform Fabrication \n \n\nRecently, the emergence of advanced techniques for polymer processing such as solid \n\nfreeform fabrication (SFF) has gained tremendous attention in the bioengineering field \n\nbecause of its ability to design of intricate devices for peripheral nerve and spinal cord \n\nrepair. SFF can fabricate 3D porous scaffolds with high degree control microstructure \n\ndirectly from a computer model. Some limitations do exist, including the high cost of the \n\ninstrument and the inability to incorporate biological components under some processing \n\nconditions [6] [70]. \n\n\n\n30 State of The Art \n\n \n \n\nDifferent techniques for the tissue engineering scaffolds fabrication are summarized and \n\ncompared in Table  2.1 [1] [71]. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable  2.1.

A \n\n1 vol.% lactic acid (LA) solution was firstly prepared in distilled water. Then, a 2 wt.% \n\nchitosan was added to this 1 vol.% LA solution, which was kept under magnetic stirring \n\novernight at 50\u00baC. The as obtained chitosan solution was filtered through a 150 \u00b5m sieve \n\nand FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder was then added in order to have a chitosan:Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 \n\nweight ratio of 50:50. Different amounts of genipin and glutaraldehyde (0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 \n\nwt.% relative to the dry mass of chitosan) were separately added as cross-liking agents for \n\n\n\nExperiments 33 \n \n\n \n \n\nchitosan matrix. The as obtained composite systems were poured into closed special \n\nmoulds to avoid evapouration and left for 20 minutes in an oven at 60\u00baC to promote \n\nreticulation. The prepared gels were frozen at ?20\u00baC for 24 h and ?80\u00baC for 4 h to evaluate \n\nthe effect of freezing temperature on the membrane properties. The frozen samples were \n\nthen lyophilized in a freeze-dryer (Labconco, USA) (Figure  3.2) at ?50\u00baC, under vacuum \n\n(45\u00d710?3 mbar), for 72 h to obtain porous membranes. Dried membranes were stored in a \n\ndesiccator at room temperature until use.  \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure  3.1.

To minimize the effect of \n\nthe water evaporation, a \"solvent trap\" was used, in order to saturate the surrounding \n\nsample environment with water. The oscillatory rheological parameters used to compare \n\n\n\nExperiments 35 \n \n\n \n \n\nthe viscoelastic properties for all the systems were the storage modulus (G?) and the loss \n\nmodulus (G??).  \n\nPreliminary tests were run to determine the linear viscoelastic range in which the \n\noscillatory tests would be performed, i.e. the range where response of the sample is within \n\nthe linear viscoelastic region. \n\nTemperature sweep measurements were also performed for all the systems in order to \n\ndetermine the required temperature-time schedule for reticulation to help stipulating the \n\nexperimental conditions to be used in further experiments. Gelation experiments were then \n\nconducted at a constant frequency (1 Hz) and stress (5 Pa) by recording the variation of the \n\nelastic modulus (G?) and viscous modulus (G??) along the time at a constant temperature of \n\n60\u00baC. The gelation time for each system was considered to be the corresponding to the \n\nrespective crossover point of G? and G??.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  3.3.

For this purpose, 3 \n\nsamples GP00 (GT00), GP05-20, and GT05-20 (Table 3.1) were selected and tested within \n\nthe wavelength range 300 \u2013 4000 cm?1, using 276 scans and 4 cm?1 resolution. \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Microstructure Analysis \n\n \n\nThe morphology of the chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 scaffolds\u2019 cross-sections were observed \n\nby scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4100, Tokyo, Japan, 15-kV \n\nacceleration voltage). The samples were cut into 5 mm diameter discs and coated with a \n\nthin layer of a gold-palladium alloy by using sputter coater (Polaron Equipment Limited \n\nSEM coating unit E5000) before SEM analysis.  \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Cross-linking Degree Determination  \n\n \n\nThe cross-linking degrees of scaffolds reticulated with GP and GT were determined by \n\nthe ninhydrin (NHN) assay described elsewhere [72] [73]. The NHN solution was prepared \n\nas follows:  \n\n \n\nSolution A:  \n\n25 ml distilled H2O containing 1.05 g citric acid (99%), 0.4 g NaOH (?97%) and 0.04 g \n\nSnCl2.2H2O (98%); \n\n \n\nSolution B: \n\n25 ml ethylene glycol monomethyl (?99.5%) containing 1 g NHN.  \n\n \n\n\n\nExperiments 37 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe two solutions were mixed with stirring for 45 min and the final NHN solution was \n\nstored in a dark bottle.  \n\nBefore determination of cross-linking degree, 4 mg of the lyophilized scaffolds from \n\neach group was heated with 2 ml NHN solution to 100\u00baC in a water bath for 20 min. The \n\nsolution was then cooled down to 20\u00baC, diluted with 5 ml of 50% isopropanol, and the \n\noptical absorbance of the solution at 570 nm was recorded with a spectrophotometer (UV-\n\n210, Hitachi, Japan) (Figure 3.4) using glycine at various known concentrations (1.0, 2.0, \n\n3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/ml) as standard.  \n\nIt is known that, after heating with NHN, the amount of free amino groups in the test \n\nsample is proportional to the optical absorbance of the solution. The measured \n\nconcentration was divided by the sample weight and multiplied by the sample molecular \n\nweight to obtain the mole NH2/mole sample. The extent of cross-linking (%CL) for each \n\nsample was calculated using the following equation: \n\n \n\n \n\n% \t =\n( \t \t ) \t\u2013\t( \t \t )\n\n( \t )\n\u00d7  \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere \u2018control\u2019 is the mole fraction of free NH2 in non-cross-linked sample \n\n(chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 without GP or GT) and \u2018fixed\u2019 is the mole fraction of free NH2 \n\nremaining in cross-linked sample. Each determination was performed in triplicate (n = 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 Experiments \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  3.4.

[74]. Porosity (%) was calculated by the following equation: \n\n \n\n \n\n\t(%) = \t \u00d7 100 =\n?\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7 100 \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere  is the total volume of the chitosan scaffold (cm3),  is the pore volume of the \n\nchitosan scaffold (cm3), \tis the weight (g) of the chitosan scaffold after incubation with \n\nethanol for 24 h, \tis the original weight (g) of the chitosan scaffold, and \tis the density \n\nof ethanol (0.789 g cm?3). \n\nEquivalent circle diameter (ECD) of the pores was calculated by using ImageJ software. \n\nIn brief, the pores were manually picked by built-in drawing functions, and the area (A) of \n\n\n\nExperiments 39 \n \n\n \n \n\neach pore was subsequently measured by using \u2018Measure\u2019 function. The pore diameter was \n\nthen calculated according to following formula:  \n\n \n\n= \t 4 /  \n\n \n\nTo validate this measurement statistically, at least three images (100 pores) with the \n\nsame magnification representing different areas of the composite were analysed at each \n\ncondition. \n\n \n\n3.3.6 Mechanical Properties \n\n \n\nThe mechanical properties of composite scaffolds reported in Table  3.1 were \n\ncharacterized by using a Universal Testing Machine (Shimadzu, AGS-X STD +250) \n\n(Figure  3.5). Cylindrical samples with dimensions (diameter = 13 mm \u00b1 0.5 mm, and \n\nlength = 0.9 mm \u00b1 0.5 mm) measured using a digital calliper (J.B.S) were tested to \n\ninvestigate the effects of different added amounts of cross-linking agents (GP and GT) on \n\ncompressive strength.   \n\nSince scaffolds for nerve regeneration must be used in the hydrated state, mechanical \n\ntests were performed in wet samples. So, prior to mechanical tests, the composite scaffolds \n\nwere fully immersed into PBS for 24 h to reach equilibrium swelling as explained in 3.3.7 \n\nsection. The excess water on the surface was gently removed by a filter paper.  \n\nThe compression load applied during compression test was 5 N, the cross head speed \n\nwas set at 1 mm/min and compressive strengths were measured at strains of 20%, 40%, \n\nand 60%. The tangent slope of the stress\u2013strain curve, with stress (kPa) on Y-axis and \n\ndeformation (%) on X-axis, was measured at 30% deformation to calculate elastic \n\nmodulus. Measurements were made eight times for each composition and average values \n\nare reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 Experiments \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  3.5.

Because chitosan contains hydroxyl and amino groups, it is easily hydrated in \n\nwater. Swelling will affect the structure of the scaffold [46]. \n\nThe swelling properties of chitosan membranes were studied by immersing the \n\npreviously weighted samples (un-cross-linked chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4, and cross-linked \n\nones with the amounts of GP and GT reported in Table 3.1 and frozen at ?20\u00baC and ?80\u00baC) \n\nin 10 ml phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37\u00baC for 24 h. \n\nAt predetermined intervals (30 min, 1, 2, 3, 12 and 24 h), the samples were withdrawn \n\nfrom the PBS solution, gently dried with a filter paper to remove the water adhered on the \n\nsurface and then weighted. The swelling ratio (SR) of these samples was calculated by \n\nusing the following equation: \n\n\n\nExperiments 41 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\t \t(%) =\n?\n\n\u00d7 100 \n\n \n\nwhere  and  are the weight of swollen samples at predetermined intervals and dry \n\nsamples, respectively. Each experiment was repeated three times and the average value \n\nwas taken to validate the results. \n\n \n\n3.3.8 Weight Loss (Degradation Test) \n\n \n\nThe in vitro degradation of the samples was evaluated in phosphate buffered saline \n\n(PBS) solution (pH 7.4) by registering the weight loss evolution with time. The dried \n\nmembranes were cut into small pieces and weighted carefully before in vitro analysis. The \n\ndried samples were submerged in PBS solution (1:100 w/v) and incubated at 37\u00baC in an \n\nincubator (Edmund B\u00fchler GmbH) (Figure  3.6) with constant shaking (120 rpm) over \n\nindicated periods of time (2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks). PBS solution was refreshed weekly to \n\nkeep a constant pH of 7.4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  3.6.

The weight loss ( ) of specimens was calculated via following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n\t(%) =\n?\n\n\u00d7 100 \n\n \n\nwhere  and  are the composite weight before and after degradation, respectively. The \n\nresults reported are averages of three measurements and standard deviations were \n\ncalculated.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 43 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 Chapter 4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n\n\n44 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 Gelation Behaviour of Chitosan-based Systems \n\n \n\nThe evolution of rheological parameters (G? and G??) of chitosan solutions with different \n\nadded amounts of reticulation agents (Table  4.1) and subjected to a temperature sweep \n\n(25\u00baC ? 90\u00baC, 3\u00baC min?1) under constant oscillation conditions (frequency = 1 Hz, strain = \n\n10?3) are shown in Figure  4.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.1. Temperature sweep for chitosan solution cross-linked with different \n\nconcentrations of genipin (GP) and glutaraldehyde (GT) at different concentrations. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe curves show an initial slightly decreasing tendency with temperature increasing up \n\nto minima values that depend on the added amount and type of cross-linker used. This \n\ndecreasing trend, attributed to a reduction of viscosity of the solutions with temperature \n\nrising, is followed by gradual and then abrupt slop increases as temperature further \n\nincreases.  This last steep increase of G? and G?? is observed within the 60 ? 80\u00baC range and \n\ncorresponds to the temperature-induced reticulation of the systems. For a given added \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 45 \n \n\n \n \n\namount of cross-linking agents, reticulation reactions seem to systematically occur slightly \n\nearlier in the presence of GT in comparison to GP.  \n\nThe evolution of G? and G?? for systems with added FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder in the \n\nabsence and in the presence of the same amounts of cross-linking agents tested for chitosan \n\nsolutions are shown in Figure  4.2 and Figure  4.3, for GP and GT, respectively. Interesting \n\nfeatures can be observed: the first descending branch of G? and G?? curves observed in \n\nFigure  4.2 was eliminated in the presence of FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder, and reticulation \n\noccurred faster than when chitosan solutions with added cross-linking agents were tested. \n\nThese features can be attributed to an active reticulation role played by the surface of \n\nFastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 particles and/or by its ionic species leached to the solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.2.

Temperature sweep for chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 systems cross-linked with \n\ndifferent amounts of GT. \n\n \n\n \n\nThese observations suggest the occurrence of specific and synergetic interactions among \n\nchitosan molecules, the surface of FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 particles and/or its ionic species leached \n\nto the solution, and the GT and GP species, which should be responsible for the observed \n\nfaster gelation process. These amazing findings also suggest the possibility of preparing \n\nself-reticulation chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite scaffolds for tissue engineering, thus \n\navoiding the use of potentially cytotoxic cross-linkers such as GT [57] [58].  \n\nThis hypothesis is confirmed by the gelation temperatures estimated from all the \n\ntemperature sweep tests, which are summarized in Table  4.1. It can be seen that for a given \n\nadded amount of cross-liking agents, the gelation temperature of chitosan solutions was \n\nalways slightly lower for GT in comparison with GP, an observation that is in good \n\nagreement with the findings reported elsewhere [75]. For composite systems, gelation \n\nalways occurs at lower temperatures in comparison to the chitosan solutions, even in the \n\nabsence of cross-liking agents. These findings open further research avenues that need to \n\nbe explored in future studies. Gelation temperature further decreases with added GP and \n\nGT, being lowest in the presence of GT due to its enhanced reticulation ability.  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 47 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable  4.1.

Time sweep profile at 60\u00baC for chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 system. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 49 \n \n\n \n \n\nIt can be seen that at this relatively high temperature (60\u00baC), reticulation started \n\nimmediately eliminating any descending trend of G? and G?? derived from temperature \n\ndependent solution viscosity, and gelation times became shorter and shorter with \n\nincreasing contents of GP and GT. It is also obvious from these Figures that initially G? &lt;\n\nG??, with both G? and G?? tending to increase with increasing setting time, but G? increases \n\nfaster than G??, thus leading to gelation.  \n\nThe time sweep profile at 60\u00baC for the chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 system in absence of \n\nany cross-liking agent occurs much faster that when starting from chitosan solutions with \n\ndifferent added amounts of GP and GT, as shown in Figure 4.5. Moreover, the maximum \n\nvalues of elastic modulus (G?) measured for this system are about two order of magnitude \n\nhigher in comparison to the corresponding ones obtained from the chitosan solutions in the \n\npresence of the cross-liking agents. The estimated gelation times of chitosan solutions \n\n(Table  4.2) decrease with increasing added amounts of cross-liking agents. For a given \n\ncross-liking content, gelation times are always shorter for GT, confirming its enhanced \n\nreticulation ability in comparison to GP. No crossover point could be detected for the \n\ncomposite system within the experimental time frame along which G? and G?? were \n\nmeasured, suggesting that cross-linking has already occurred before starting the \n\nrheological measurements. \n \n\n \n\nTable  4.2. Gelation times at 60\u00baC for chitosan solutions cross-linked with different added \n\namounts of GP and GT, and for the composite system without any cross-linking agent. \n\n \nGelation time (min) at 60?C (min) \n\nGP01 ~ 32 \n\nGP05 ~ 31 \n\nGP50 ~ 22 \n\nGT01 ~ 12 \n\nGT05 ~ 8 \n\nGT50 ~ 6 \n\nChitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 (50/50) Already cross-linked \n\n \n\n\n\n50 Results and Discussion \n\n \n \n\nThe results showed that only relatively weak gels could be obtained by blending 2 wt.% \n\nchitosan solution with cross-linking agents up to 0.5 wt.%, while strong gels could be \n\nquickly achieved from the composite systems even in absence of cross-linking agents, \n\nalthough more efficiently in their presence. Therefore, it was concluded FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 \n\npowder has the ability to form complexes with dissociated chitosan molecules.  \n\nChitosan contains two different kinds of functional groups, hydroxyl (?OH) groups and \n\namino (?NH2) groups, which are responsible for the reactivity of this polymer as an \n\nexcellent natural adsorbent and give chitosan its powerful adsorptive capacity [76]. The \n\nsurface adsorption mechanism would involve coulombic interactions between the positive \n\namino groups of chitosan and the negative surface sites of FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4. Acidic pH is \n\nnecessary for the protonation of amino (?NH3+) groups of chitosan. These protonated \n\ngroups are likely to bind to the negatively charged surface FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4. On the other \n\nhand, hydroxyl (?OH) groups are also likely to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with \n\nthe surface silanol groups of FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powders, thus contributing to strengthen the \n\ncomposite gels. But the most probable gel strengthening mechanism, in the case of \n\nchitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite systems, is a cationic exchange between protonated \n\namino groups of chitosan and cationic sites onto the surface of the bioactive glass particles \n\nand/or the cationic species leached out to the solution as sketched below: \n\n \n\n2\t ? ? \t+ \t \t? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (1) \n\n \n\nA similar cationic exchange mechanism could be hypothesised for the replacement of \n\ntwo hydronium ions from different chitosan ( ? ? ) molecules by a divalent cation, \n\nwhich would involve a decrease in pH of the media:  \n\n \n\n? ? \t + \t ? ? \t +\t\t \t2 \t ? \t ? ? ? ? ? ? \t + \t2  (2) \n\n \n\nAccording to Rhazi et al.

The most intense bands within the 600 \u2013 1300 cm?1 region correspond to the \n\nstretching vibrations of the SiO4 tetrahedron with a different number of bridging oxygen \n\natoms. The 800\u20131300 cm?1 region is split in two bands centred at ~1040 cm?1 and ~920 \n\ncm?1, which can be assigned to the Si\u2013O asymmetric stretching mode of BOs, and to the \n\nSi\u2013O asymmetric stretching mode of the non-bridging oxygens (NBOs), respectively. \n\nFurthermore, the 510 cm?1 band can be attributed to Si\u2013O\u2013Si bending modes, while the \n\nweak 740 cm?1 shoulder may be due to Si\u2013O\u2013Si symmetric stretching with simultaneous Si \n\ncation motions. It is noteworthy that the band at 1040 cm?1 may also be assigned to the \n\nasymmetric stretching of PO4 units which has been reported to appear in crystalline \n\nfluorapatite at 1038 cm?1 [78]. \n\nThe FTIR spectra of chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composites exhibit characteristic bands of \n\nchitosan. The band in the region of 3400\u20133500 cm?1 corresponds to the stretching vibration \n\nof N?H peaks at around 3480 cm?1 and might be also be superimposed with the absorption \n\nband due to OH group. The peaks at around 2916 cm?1 and 2848 cm?1 are assigned to CH2 \nand CH3 groups (aliphatic group). The bands at ~1660 cm?1 and ~1585 cm?1 are \n\ncharacteristic of respectively amide I and amide II, denoting the presence of acetyl group \n\n(?CH3?C=O), so these results confirm that chitosan is partially in deacetylated form. The \n\npeaks around 1420 cm?1 are assigned to the CH3 symmetrical deformation mode, and the \n\npeaks in the range of 1155 cm?1, 1097 cm?1 and 1043 cm?1 correspond to the C?O \n\nstretching vibrations. Table  4.3 summarizes the FTIR data, identifying the main vibration \n\nbands and the corresponding assigned functional groups. The mentioned characteristic \n\nbands are in good agreement with data previously reported [79] [80]. \n\nThe spectra of chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite systems cross-linked with GP or GT \n\nalso show similar absorption bands as those identified for the composite system in absence \n\nof cross-liking agents. This suggests that the most determinant reticulation mechanisms \n\nderive from the interactions between chitosan molecules and the surface of bioactive glass \n\nparticles and/or the ionic species leached thereof, with the cross-linking agents GP and GT \n\nplaying secondary roles. This main conclusion is consistent with the rheological results \n\npresented in Figure  4.1? Figure 4.5, and data reported in Table  4.1?

Figure 4.8. \n\nThe SEM micrographs show high porosity with almost interconnected spherical pores in \n\nirregular pattern. Both the cross-linking concentration and freezing temperature seemingly \n\naffected the final porous structures of the scaffolds. Irregular porosity is mostly caused by \n\nthe freeze drying and sample preparation conditions. The pores are created by the ice \n\ncrystals that sublimate during freeze drying, leaving gaps or pores in their place. The pore \n\nstructure corresponds to the size and shape of the ice crystals. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 Results and Discussion \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.7.

This evolution can be \n\nunderstood considering that an enhanced reticulation is likely to led to finer 3D porous \n\nnetwork, and is in line with other findings reported before [73] [81]. However, there is not \n\na complete consensus in these matters. For example, the groups of Bi [72] and Gorczyca \n\n[82] reported an increase of pore size with increasing amounts of added GP used to cross-\n\nlink chitosan-collagen scaffolds. Our observations when using GP also contrast with an \n\nopposite evolution observed for the composites cross-linked with GT (Figure 4.8) in which \n\nthe pore size increased from 72 ? 16 ?m to 119 ? 30 ?m as the GT concentration increased \n\nfrom 0.01 to 0.5 wt.%. All these results suggest that the pore structure is affected not only \n\nby the type and added amount of cross-linking agent but also by other experimental factors \n\nsuch as reticulation and freezing temperatures for polymeric solutions, and the presence \n\ninorganic components or dissolves species, the separate effects of which need to be better \n\nunderstood. \n\nThe effect of freezing temperature can be evaluated by comparing the SEM micrographs \n\nshown in Figure  4.9? Figure 4.10, which correspond to chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite \n\nscaffolds frozen at ?20\u00baC and ?80\u00baC, respectively. It is clear that scaffolds frozen at ?20\u00baC \n\nhave a more opened and spaced structure. The formation of a highly closed tight network \n\nof scaffolds at ?80\u00baC could be explained as a result of faster gelation, which resulted in the \n\nformation of smaller ice crystals and restricted more their growth along the holding time at \n\nthis temperature. At ?20\u00baC the growth of ice crystals is facilitated by the higher kinetic \n\nenergy of water molecules for diffusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 57 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.9.

It can be seen that cross-linking degrees increased with increasing added \n\namounts of GP or GT. These results confirm that GP is a less efficient cross-linker in \n\ncomparison to GT, in good consistency with the finding from rheological measurements. It \n\ncan be also concluded that cross-linking degree was independent of freezing temperature, \n\nin agreement with similar observations reports elsewhere [83] [84]. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable  4.4.

According to the results, neither GP nor GT \n\ndid utilize all available amino groups at the tested concentrations and chitosan has not been \n\ncompletely cross-linked. However, GT is again confirmed to be the most efficient one. Its \n\ncapability to cross-link amine containing polymers by forming amine\u2013amine bonds, so-\n\ncalled Schiff bases, to improved mechanical properties of scaffolds and decrease chitosan \n\ndegradation in biological tissues has been widely acknowledged [85] [75]. The different \n\ncross-linking efficiencies might help explaining the differences observed in SEM \n\nmicrographs of Figure 4.1? Fugure 4.5, and data reported in Table 4.1? Table 4.2.  \n\nOn the other hand, GP consisting of a simple aromatic ring is not likely to produce \n\nhydrophobic p-stacking interactions with chitosan and, consequently, has a lower \n\ncapability to cross-link chitosan matrix in the tested condition as compared with GT [75]. \n\nFigure  4.13 shows the schematics of chitosan cross-linking with GP and GT under near \n\nneutral conditions (pH ~ 6.8) [75]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.13. Schematic representations of the most probable chemical reactions involved at the site \n\nof free amino groups of chitosan under near neutral conditions (pH ~6.8) with (a) GP, and (b) GT \n\n[75]. \n\n \n\n(a\n\n(b\n\n\n\n62 Results and Discussion \n\n \n \n\nAccording to Kil\u2019deeva et al. [80], the reactivity of GT with amino groups of chitosan is \n\ndifferent at different pH values. They have shown that in weakly acidic and neutral \n\nsolutions (pH 3.0\u20137.2), no oligomerization is promoted by GT. At pH ? 5.6, the \n\ndissociation of a proton from the OCHCH2 leads to the formation of an anion, the first \n\nstage of the aldol reaction. In a weakly alkaline medium (pH > 7.2) such as in the present \n\nwork, GT is polymerized and the products of the aldol reaction and aldol condensation are \n\nformed, in which the polymerization rate increases with the concentration of hydroxyl ions. \n\nIncreasing the pH value above 10 leads to the formation of water-soluble and -insoluble \n\npolymeric products of the aldol reaction and the condensation of GT. \n\nIn fact, the crosslinking is facilitated by formation of many irregular oligomeric \n\nglutaraldehyde molecules in which one aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde can react with \n\nchitosan while the other aldehyde group can undergo polymerization and eventually form \n\nbonds with other chitosan molecules. The mechanism leads to formation of a cross-linked \n\nstructure with longer intermolecular chain lengths than would have been expected from \n\nmonomeric glutaraldehyde. Formation of self-polymerized glutaraldehyde compounds, and \n\ntheir influence on chitosan cross-linked structures has been reported in details in some \n\nprevious works [80] [86]. \n\nThe cross-linking reaction mechanisms for chitosan with GP are also pH dependent. \n\nUnder acidic and neutral conditions, a nucleophilic attack by the amino groups of chitosan \n\non the olefinic carbon atom at C-3 occurs, followed by opening the dihydropyran ring of \n\nGP and attacked by the secondary amino group on the newly formed aldehyde group. In \n\nthe product, short chains of condensed GP act as cross-linking bridges. Under basic \n\nconditions, the ring-opening reaction of GP occurs via a nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl \n\nions in aqueous solution to form intermediate aldehyde groups, which subsequently \n\nundergo aldol condensation. The terminal aldehyde groups on the polymerized GP undergo \n\na Schiff reaction with the amino groups on chitosan to form cross-linked networks. \n\nTherefore, the pH condition plays an important role in influencing the cross-linking \n\nreactions [87], which is linked to the available number of free amino groups in solution.  \n\nUnder acidic environments the amino groups are essentially protonated and their \n\nparticipation in cross-linking process is more limited. As pH of solution increases, the \n\nnumber of free amino groups also increases leading to a consequent reduction in gelation \n\ntime. This phenomenon is true for both GT and GP.  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 63 \n \n\n \n \n\n4.5 Pore Size and Porosity Measurement \n\n \n\nIn this study, pore sizes and porosity fractions of the composite scaffolds were \n\nevaluated using cylindrical samples of (2.4 cm diameter \u00d7 0.9 cm height) immersed into \n\nethanol. The porosity values reported in Table  4.5 vary within the range of 80-92% \n\ndepending on freezing temperature and cross-liking agent used.  \n\n \n\n \nTable  4.5.

These \n\nresults are very consistent with other data reported above, namely the obtained by \n\nrheological measurements (Figure 4.1? Figure 4.5, and Tables 4.1? Table 4.2) and cross-\n\nliking degrees (Table  4.4). All these results point out to an apparent enhanced reticulation \n\nefficiency of chitosan with added FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 powder in comparison to the chitosan \n\nsolutions with added GT and GP. For an easier visualization, the porosity data of \n\ncomposites scaffolds cross-linked with GP and GT have also been plotted in Figure  4.14 to \n\nFigure 4.17 aiming at better comparing the separate effects of cross-likers and freezing \n\ntemperatures.  \n\n\n\n64 Results and Discussion \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.14.

The \n\noverall results observed in the present work are in good agreement with findings reported \n\nby Shirosaki [88], Ren [89], Kang [90] and Ho [91]. \n\nThe larger pores will provide space for the migration of cells and to improve the \n\ndiffusion of nutrients and metabolites throughout the membrane [81]. Some reports point \n\nout that multi-channel conduits with relatively higher porosity and greater average channel \n\ndiameters could provide a more permissive environment for axonal ingrowth than those \n\nhaving lower porosity and smaller average channel diameters [92] [93]. The adhesion and \n\nproliferation of cells are influenced by porosity so this is a decisive factor for absorption \n\nability of scaffolds. High porosity and interconnectivity pore structure are necessary for \n\ntissue-guided scaffold materials. The pore diameter should be in the range of cell diameters \n\nto enable cell infiltration and vascularization of the scaffold [94]. Chitosan membranes \n\nwith about 90% porosity and average pore size of ~110 ?m were reported to significantly \n\nimprove nerve fibre regeneration and the degree of functional recovery [95]. In other study \n\ndone by Wan et al. [96] the porosity and average channel diameter of the conduits were \n\nrespectively set as around 80% and 200 ?m by controlling processing parameters with \n\nrequired mechanical strength and degradation rates. In addition, it has also been observed \n\nthat the channels inside conduits would be blocked due to swelling of the conduits if the \n\nchannel diameters are too small, resulting in no nerve growth in the blocked conduits [93]. \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 67 \n \n\n \n \n\n4.6 Mechanical Properties \n\n \n\nHydrated porous chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite scaffolds were soft, spongy and \n\nvery flexible. No maximum compression strength was obtained because the scaffolds did \n\nnot break when subject to compression up to strain values of ~60%, the maximum value \n\nused for all the samples. The date plotted in Figure  4.18? Figure  4.21 are intended to \n\nconvey an easy visualization of the separate effects of added cross-likers and freezing \n\ntemperatures on the mechanical properties of chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite scaffolds.  \n\nGenerally, the mechanical compressive strength values of the cross-linked chitosan \n\nscaffolds always increases with increasing added amounts of cross-linking. The only \n\nexception was observed for the highest added amount of GT. This deviation from the main \n\ntrend can be attributed to the concomitant increase of the average size of pores formed \n\nunder these conditions. The smaller average pore sizes formed in samples frozen at ?80\u00baC \n\ncan also explain the systematically higher compressive strength values registered for these \n\nsamples in comparison to those obtained from samples frozen at ?20\u00baC. The same \n\nargument is also valid when comparing the compressive strength values of composite \n\nscaffolds reticulated with different cross-linking agents. The higher percentages of porosity \n\nmeasured for scaffolds cross-linked with GP (Table  4.6), coupled with the larger pores \n\nobserved for these scaffolds (Figure  4.7 and Figure  4.8) support the registered compressive \n\nstrength data plotted in Figure  4.18?

Hence, in order to yield ideal polymer \n\nscaffolds, the optimal crosslinking condition should be investigated.  \n\nNerve conduits with enough mechanical properties will resist muscular contractions and \n\nmaintain structural support with enough space and stability to facilitate nerve regeneration \n\n[35]. The enhanced mechanical properties of chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite \n\nmembranes will allow better shape stability in comparison to those made from chitosan \n\nalone, making them more promising for these biomedical applications. \n\n \n\n4.7 Swelling Behaviours \n\n \n\nThe swelling ratio is an important index used to evaluate the structural stability of a \n\nbiodegradable scaffold. The swelling should be moderate. If too great, the scaffold will \n\nswell much in vivo, decreasing the available space the biological processes to occur within \n\nthe scaffold. If too poor, it will cause local hydropenia at the implanting site [49]. As \n\nshown in Figure  4.30 to Figure  4.33, the scaffolds with added cross-linking agents exhibit \n\na higher swelling capacity in comparison to that obtained without cross-linkers.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.30.

Swelling ratio of chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-\n\nlinked without and with different added amounts of GT, frozen at ?80\u00baC.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe swelling data plotted in Figure  4.30 to Figure  4.33 show an abrupt initial increase \n\nof PBS solution uptake followed by an accentuated decreasing trend up to about 3 h, and \n\nthen by a slow and steadily decreasing along the remaining testing time interval (up to 24 \n\nh). It can be seen that the less swelling capacity was obtained in the absence of cross-liking \n\nagents, followed by the samples with the highest amounts of GP and GT. The differences \n\nobserved among the samples are consistent with the measured percentages of porosity \n\n(Table 4.5). In addition, the volume or shape of all scaffolds scarcely changed during \n\nsoaking in PBS. The scaffolds absorbed PBS solution without collapsing of the 3D pore \n\nstructure. \n\nThe swelling properties of porous chitosan-based scaffolds can be understood based on \n\nthe hydrophilic and cationic character of this polymer. Besides porosity, cross-linking of \n\nchitosan can also change its hydrophilicity, which, in turn will further decrease the \n\nswelling ratio scaffold [101]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the swelling behaviour of \n\nthe composite chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 membranes and their mechanical stability are \n\nmostly determined by the porous structure and the relevant factors behind it (the kind and \n\nthe added amount of cross-linker, and processing temperatures).

Figure 4.37, it can be seen that the degradation rates decrease \n\nwith increasing added amounts of cross-linking agents at constant pH = 7.4, with the \n\nhighest values being observed for the control sample reticulated without any added cross-\n\nlinker. Another important conclusion is that degradation rates are systematically slower for \n\nsamples frozen at the lower freezing temperature (?80\u00baC).  \n\nThis expected behaviour is eventually more easily observed when degradation data of \n\nchitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-linked with GP or GT, collected after \n\nsoaking for 8 weeks in PBS solution is plotted against the added amounts of cross-linking \n\nagents, as shown in Figure  4.38 and Figure  4.39.  \n\nThe results observed are according to the cross-linking degree detected by the NHN \n\nassay. The higher crosslinking degrees promoted by GT (Table  4.4) resulted in systematic \n\nlower weight losses. Regardless of the presence, or not, of cross-linking agents and of the \n\nweight losses undergone, all composite scaffolds maintained their structural integrity, an \n\nessential feature for successful applications in nerve repair. \n\n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2 4 6 8\n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt l\n\nos\ns \n\n(%\n)\n\nTime (weeks)\n\nGT00-80 GT01-80\nGT05-80 GT50-80\n\n\n\nResults and Discussion 81 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure  4.38.

Although the \n\nsetting/reticulation mechanism still demands further investigations to become fully \n\nunderstood, it was hypothesized that both active sites at the surface of bioactive glass \n\nparticles and the ionic species leached off to the solution are likely to play a cross-liking \n\nrole. These amazing findings mean that the use of potentially cytotoxic cross-linkers such \n\nas GT can be avoided, thus making the membranes for nerve regeneration innocuous and \n\nbio-friendly.  \n\nBesides this main important achievement, several other specific conclusions can be \n\ndrawn from the present work as detailed below: \n\n \n\n1. The naturally occurring genipin (GP) and the traditional synthetic glutaraldehyde \n\n(GT) revealed to be suitable cross-linkers for making 3D composite \n\nchitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 porous membranes for nerve regeneration. The cross-linking \n\nefficiency and the consequent mechanical stability are generally higher in the case of \n\nGT in comparison to GP, except for the highest added amount of GT.  \n\n \n\n2. The enhanced cross-linking efficiency of GT resulted in higher cross-linking \n\ndegrees and systematic lower percentages of porosity and swelling ratios, and slower \n\ndegradation rates upon immersion in PBS solution, as expressed by the undergone \n\nweight losses along a time period of 8 weeks. Accordingly, the higher degradation rates \n\nwere observed for the self-reticulated porous chitosan/FastOs\u00aeBG-Z4 composite \n\nmembranes. \n\n \n\n3. For both cross-linking agents used, the cross-linking degree always increased with \n\nthe added amounts, within the range of concentrations tested, with direct reflexes in \n\nterms of the overall properties of the resulting scaffolds. \n\n\n\n84 Conclusions \n \n\n \n \n\n4. The lower freezing temperature (?80\u00baC) revealed to be more effective in decreasing \n\nthe pore size and porosity fraction, thus enhancing the mechanical properties and the \n\nstability of the scaffolds when submitted to swelling and degradation tests.  \n\n \n\n5. The freezing temperature of ?20\u00baC was selected as the most suitable one when \n\nconsidering the porous microstructural features and the intended applications. \n\n \n\n6. Regardless of the presence, or not, of cross-linking agents and of the weight losses \n\nundergone, all composite scaffolds maintained their structural integrity, an essential \n\nfeature for successful applications in nerve repair. \n\n \n\n\n\nFuture Work 85 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6 Chapter 6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFuture Work and Recommendations \n  \n\n\n\n86 Future Work \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThe most salient finding of the present work opened further research avenues that need \n\nto be explored in future studies. The self-reticulation mechanism of chitosan/Fastos\u00aeBG-\n\nZ4 needs to be investigated in detail in order to clarify the relative importance of the \n\nsurface chemistry of the bioactive glass particles and of the dissolves ionic species. It \n\nwould be also important studying the influence of different chitosan/Fastos\u00aeBG-Z4 weight \n\nratios on the gelation process and on the overall properties of the resulting scaffolds.  \n\nObviously, testing the scaffolds in vitro for cytotoxicity, biocompatibility and cell \n\nproliferation, and in vivo are essential steps to be conducted in the future to evaluate the \n\nsuitability of the composite membranes for the intended clinical applications as nerve \n\nguides in peripheral nerve regeneration. \n\n  \n\n\n\nReferences 87 \n \n\n \n \n\n7 List of References \n\n \n\n[1]  N.
