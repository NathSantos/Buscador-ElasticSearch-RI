This research describes \n\nand evaluates the historical data for these E&amp;P licensing, as well as for tenders of marginal \n\noilfield accumulations, under the Brazilian economic scenario and the geologic potential of the \n\ncountry. It also compares oil companies performance regarding investment made in acquiring \n\nareas in Brazil to those in US-Gulf of Mexico. A stochastic model for block-value estimation is \n\npresented and applied to previous data from Campos Basin licensed areas. In order to estimate the \n\nlevel of competition expected for those areas, an expert system was built using Exsys Corvid\u00ae, \n\nbased on the knowledge captured from 36 specialists in Brazilian public licensing working for 20 \n\noil companies. The proposed methodology is applied to the case of Campos Basin areas and \n\nshowed to properly estimate the levels of competition expected (high, moderate or low) in the \n\nbid. By knowing the block-value and the expected level of competition, decision makers are \n\nbetter prepared for formulating bidding strategies that can result in better resources allocation and \n\nyield a better exploration portfolio management. \n\n \n\nKey Words \n\nPetroleum exploration and production, petroleum public licensing, competition, games, auction, \n\nrisk and uncertainties, economic evaluation, expert system \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nxv \n \n\nSUM\u00c1RIO \n\nLISTA DE FIGURAS................................................................................................................ xvii \n\nLISTA DE TABELAS ................................................................................................................ xxi \n\n1.

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n1.1. Motiva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nNa ind\u00fastria brasileira do petr\u00f3leo, bem como em v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses do mundo em que o estado \n\n\u00e9 o propriet\u00e1rio dos recursos minerais existentes no subsolo, a transfer6encia de direitos e \n\nobriga\u00e7\u00f5es para explorar e produzir petr\u00f3leo se d\u00e1 por meio de licita\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00fablicas de \u00e1reas pr\u00e9-\n\ndeterminadas, e segundo regras pr\u00e9-estabelecidas pela ag\u00eancia reguladora. \n\nAs companhias de petr\u00f3leo qualificadas para participar desses processos licitat\u00f3rios \n\ncompetem entre si pela aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o dessas \u00e1reas para compor / recompor seu portf\u00f3lio explorat\u00f3rio \n\nou explotat\u00f3rio. Portanto, para vencerem a competi\u00e7\u00e3o entre si, essas companhias devem \n\napresentar a oferta mais competitiva, cuja elabora\u00e7\u00e3o se baseia em dois aspectos cr\u00edticos: a \n\nvalora\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnico-econ\u00f4mica da \u00e1rea e a an\u00e1lise da competi\u00e7\u00e3o esperada para a \u00e1rea de interesse.  \n\nCada companhia faz sua estimativa de valor da \u00e1rea e compromete uma fra\u00e7\u00e3o deste valor \n\ncomo oferta na licita\u00e7\u00e3o. A estimativa desta fra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3tima \u00e9 dada por modelos matem\u00e1ticos, \n\namplamente divulgados na literatura, que visam determinar a oferta \u00f3tima capaz de maximizar os \n\ninvestimentos da companhia. Esses modelos adotam como premissa, dentre outras, que exista \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o pela \u00e1rea. Entretanto, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o conhecidos na literatura modelos que permitam realizar \n\nesta an\u00e1lise de competi\u00e7\u00e3o considerando a percep\u00e7\u00e3o dos decisores. Sabendo que a an\u00e1lise de \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um fator que pode modificar consideravelmente a oferta que a companhia \n\napresentar\u00e1 para uma \u00e1rea, esta pesquisa se dedicou ao desenvolvimento de ferramentas para o \n\nc\u00e1lculo da oferta \u00f3tima e estimativa do n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o esperado nas licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n2 \n \n\n1.2. Objetivos \n\nA presente pesquisa objetiva desenvolver um m\u00e9todo de estimativa do n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nesperado em uma determinada licita\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica brasileira para \u00e1reas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npetr\u00f3leo (E&amp;P), localizadas em uma bacia sedimentar mar\u00edtima com sistema petrol\u00edfero ativo.  \n\nSua contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para a ind\u00fastria do petr\u00f3leo, dentre outras, \u00e9 auxiliar os decisores nos \n\nprocessos de elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de estrat\u00e9gias de oferta mais competitivas que maximizem os \n\ninvestimentos e/ou aumentem a chance das empresas adquirirem \u00e1reas de E&amp;P. \n\n1.3. Estrutura do Trabalho \n\n \nPara se alcan\u00e7ar o objetivo pretendido, esse trabalho contou com uma extensa pesquisa \n\nbibliogr\u00e1fica sobre licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras de \u00e1reas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo (E&amp;P), \n\nsobre modelos e processos de licita\u00e7\u00e3o no mundo, e ouviu a opini\u00e3o de especialistas com \n\nexperi\u00eancia em leil\u00f5es no Brasil e no mundo.

Inicialmente, \u00e9 mostrado o cen\u00e1rio \n\nde pre\u00e7o do petr\u00f3leo mundial, em queda a partir da d\u00e9cada de 80, e os resultados de sucesso \n\nexplorat\u00f3rio alcan\u00e7ados simultaneamente pela Petrobras com a descoberta de campos gigantes de \n\n\u00f3leo na Bacia de Campos, que motivaram empresas estrangeiras a participarem das licita\u00e7\u00f5es \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n3 \n \n\ninstitu\u00eddas quando da san\u00e7\u00e3o da Lei 9478/97 pelo governo. A id\u00e9ia central deste cap\u00edtulo \u00e9 \n\nmostrar que o modelo adotado pela ANP, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados das licita\u00e7\u00f5es, \u00e9 considerado \n\nsucesso dentro dos conceitos te\u00f3ricos que analisam o n\u00famero de participantes no processo \n\n(competidores), a quantidade de \u00e1rea adquirida e o montante de b\u00f4nus arrecadado pelo governo. \n\nAp\u00f3s seis anos licitando com sucesso as \u00e1reas explorat\u00f3rias, a ANP ofereceu ao mercado \n\n\u00e1reas inativas com acumula\u00e7\u00e3o marginais de petr\u00f3leo sob um modelo muito semelhante ao j\u00e1 \n\nconsagrado. O cap\u00edtulo 3 apresenta as informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre este modelo e os resultados das duas \n\nlicita\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o, mostrando que devido ao car\u00e1ter de baixos volumes recuper\u00e1veis, \n\no n\u00famero e o perfil das companhias que competem por essas \u00e1reas difere daquelas que se \n\nqualificam para as licita\u00e7\u00f5es explorat\u00f3rias. Em geral, s\u00e3o companhias brasileiras de pequeno \n\nporte que competem pelas \u00e1reas, preferencialmente consorciadas entre si, e que n\u00e3o t\u00eam perfil de \n\natua\u00e7\u00e3o conhecido no segmento \u201cupstream\u201d da cadeia do petr\u00f3leo. O objetivo dessa se\u00e7\u00e3o, cujo \n\nartigo foi publicado na Revista Brasileira de Geoci\u00eancias, v. 38, no. 2 em 2008, al\u00e9m de \n\napresentar os dados compilados destas licita\u00e7\u00f5es, \u00e9 mostrar que a an\u00e1lise de competi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um \n\nestudo a ser feito para qualquer processo decis\u00f3rio de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1rea via licita\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica. \n\nEntretanto, as \u00e1reas inativas com acumula\u00e7\u00f5es marginais n\u00e3o foram alvo deste estudo devido \u00e0 \n\naus\u00eancia de um n\u00famero de dados estatisticamente significativo para a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos de \n\nvalora\u00e7\u00e3o e competi\u00e7\u00e3o aqui propostos. \n\nAssim sendo, tais m\u00e9todos foram desenvolvidos para as licita\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1reas explorat\u00f3rias da \n\nBacia de Campos, por esta ter sido ofertada em oito das dez licita\u00e7\u00f5es promovidas pela ANP, \n\nexistindo, portanto, uma massa cr\u00edtica de dados que permitiram estudar os processos decis\u00f3rios de \n\naquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas. A tomada de decis\u00e3o sobre qual a oferta mais competitiva a apresentar precisa \n\nconsiderar o valor \u00f3timo da oferta a ser comprometida como b\u00f4nus de assinatura, o montante de \n\nprograma de trabalho explorat\u00f3rio (PEM) e o n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o esperado para cada \u00e1rea. O \n\ncap\u00edtulo 4 mostra que a busca por m\u00e9todos que maximizem as ofertas apresentadas pelas \n\ncompanhias \u00e9 objeto de estudo de v\u00e1rios autores, conforme indicado na literatura deste artigo \n\npublicado na AAPG Bulletin, v. 92, no. 10 em 2008. Dentro dos conceitos de efici\u00eancia alocativa, \n\nmaximiza\u00e7\u00e3o de receitas e multidimensionalidade das informa\u00e7\u00f5es e das propostas foi \n\ndesenvolvido um m\u00e9todo, baseado na simula\u00e7\u00e3o estoc\u00e1stica utilizando o m\u00e9todo de Monte Carlo, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n4 \n \n\npara calcular a oferta \u00f3tima a partir das informa\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00fablicas (sim\u00e9tricas) existentes. Os \n\nresultados simulados s\u00e3o comparados aos b\u00f4nus efetivamente realizados e a an\u00e1lise das \n\nestrat\u00e9gias adotadas pelas companhias, permite o decisor identificar como \u00e9 poss\u00edvel elaborar \n\numa estrat\u00e9gia de oferta competitiva utilizando diferentes valores da fra\u00e7\u00e3o do valor monet\u00e1rio \n\nesperado (VME) da \u00e1rea. \n\nA partir deste ponto da pesquisa duas quest\u00f5es suscitaram interesse em se investigar: \n\na) a primeira se refere aos valores de oferta que as companhias de petr\u00f3leo est\u00e3o oferecendo para \n\nas \u00e1reas da Bacia de Campos. Partindo da premissa da licita\u00e7\u00e3o competitiva selada, ou seja, que \n\ntais companhias n\u00e3o conhecem os valores que seus competidores ir\u00e3o oferecer pela \u00e1rea, nem \n\nquais s\u00e3o estas \u00e1reas de interesse, nem quantos e quais s\u00e3o estes competidores, foi testada a \n\nhip\u00f3tese de que as empresas que participam de uma licita\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira realizam investimentos \n\npara aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas similares aos realizados para \u00e1reas no Golfo do M\u00e9xico Americano; \n\nb) a segunda diz respeito ao processo decis\u00f3rio em si que requer uma an\u00e1lise de competi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrobusta para que a oferta mais competitiva seja  vencedora, sem entretanto, deixar um montante \n\nde dinheiro desnecess\u00e1rio sobre a mesa ou que permita a companhia n\u00e3o ser v\u00edtima da maldi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo vencedor (pagamento de b\u00f4nus muito elevados que n\u00e3o retornar\u00e3o os investimentos \n\nrealizados). \n\n O cap\u00edtulo 5 aborda o teste de hip\u00f3tese supracitado, tendo sido escolhido o Golfo do \n\nM\u00e9xico Americano (US-GOM) por ter suas \u00e1reas licitadas, segundo um modelo com din\u00e2mica de \n\noferta semelhante \u00e0s licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras, por mais de 40 anos, apresentando \u00e1reas com \n\nresultados de sucesso explorat\u00f3rio, campos em produ\u00e7\u00e3o com infraestrutura de escoamento, e \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas geol\u00f3gicas para acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarboneto, similares as da Bacia de Campos \n\n(BC). A an\u00e1lise comparativa entre as ofertas do US-GOM e da BC considerou os valores de \n\nb\u00f4nus e PEM e teve seus resultados publicados sob o no. SPE 113696 dos anais do 2008 SPE \n\nEuropec / EAGE Annual Conf. and Exhibition. A an\u00e1lise foi conduzida para ofertas por \u00e1reas de \n\n\u00e1guas rasas e profundas, onde se observou que as empresas internacionais adquirem as \u00e1reas da \n\nBC desembolsando valores \u201cupfront\u201d compar\u00e1veis aos b\u00f4nus pagos por \u00e1reas no US-GOM, \n\npor\u00e9m comprometendo valores adicionais a t\u00edtulo de PEM como pagamento de longo termo.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n5 \n \n\n No cap\u00edtulo 6 \u00e9 apresentada a metodologia desenvolvida para auxiliar os decisores no \n\nprocesso de estimativa de competi\u00e7\u00e3o que suporta a escolha da melhor estrat\u00e9gia de oferta. Esta \n\nse\u00e7\u00e3o, estruturada sob a forma de artigo t\u00e9cnico ainda n\u00e3o foi publicada, mas seu conte\u00fado foi \n\nsubmetido \u00e0 aprecia\u00e7\u00e3o do editor da revista Resources Policy. Com o intuito de identificar como \n\nos decisores estimam a competi\u00e7\u00e3o, alguns m\u00e9todos de pesquisa operacional baseados em an\u00e1lise \n\nmutliatributo foram investigados (matriz de decis\u00e3o e processo anal\u00edtico hier\u00e1rquico) com o \n\nsuporte acad\u00eamico do Prof. Dr. Michael Walls na Economic and Business Division da Colorado \n\nSchool of Mines. Por\u00e9m, tais m\u00e9todos, apesar de lidar com a prefer\u00eancia dos decisores, n\u00e3o \n\nincorporam processos cognitivos como o julgamento de cada decisor (racioc\u00ednio l\u00f3gico \n\nconstru\u00eddo a partir de suas experi\u00eancias e conhecimento). M\u00e9todos como sistema especialista, \n\nramo da intelig\u00eancia artificial, capturam tais julgamentos, sendo capaz de auxiliar as tomadas de \n\ndecis\u00e3o a partir da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma base de conhecimento e da formula\u00e7\u00e3o de regras que \n\nrepresentam a l\u00f3gica racional dos decisores. A constru\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema especialista se deu a partir \n\nda captura do conhecimento de 36 representantes da ind\u00fastria do petr\u00f3leo familiarizados com os \n\nprocessos de licita\u00e7\u00e3o no Brasil. Profissionais de empresas de pequeno, m\u00e9dio e grande porte \n\nforam convidados a responder um question\u00e1rio in\u00e9dito desenvolvido especificamente para \n\nabordar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o por \u00e1reas da Bacia de Campos, o qual permitiu quantificar a percep\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de parcerias e outros. Transformando este conhecimento em vari\u00e1veis, regras \n\ne blocos l\u00f3gicos com a plataforma Exsys Corvid\u00ae, foi poss\u00edvel estimar o n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nesperado para cen\u00e1rios vari\u00e1veis do tipo de \u00e1reas ofertadas, do n\u00famero e perfil de companhias \n\nparticipantes e quanto ao tipo e proveni\u00eancia das informa\u00e7\u00f5es que circulam durante o per\u00edodo de \n\nlicita\u00e7\u00e3o e que podem impactar a an\u00e1lise de competi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n Toda a metodologia desenvolvida nesse trabalho se voltou para as licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras de \n\n\u00e1reas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o sob o modelo de concess\u00e3o adotado pela ANP. Entretanto, \n\nmotivada pelo novo marco regulat\u00f3rio que determina a assun\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo de Partilha de \n\nProdu\u00e7\u00e3o (PSC) para licitar \u00e1reas explorat\u00f3rias da camada do pr\u00e9-sal, esta pesquisa capturou o \n\njulgamento dos especialistas quanto ao poss\u00edvel impacto que este modelo e suas regras poderiam \n\ncausar na competi\u00e7\u00e3o por estas \u00e1reas.

Introduction  \n\n \nThis article proposes a method to estimate competition level for future Brazilian petroleum \n\nleases, built upon Campos Basin history data. \n\n \n\nThe method can be applied to all competitive licensing structures, independently of the type of \n\nexploration agreement used (concession or production sharing contracts), but varying the premises \n\nadopted. The level of competition in both agreement models is broadly the same, but there are \n\nsome intrinsic differences, widely reviewed by the literature, that could lead to changes in the \n\nlicensing results. \n\n \n\nThe estimation of the competition level is directly related to the definition of the winning offer. \n\nAccording to Capen et al. (1971) and Lohrenz (1987), the optimal bid estimation is based on the \n\nhighest signature bonus value. However, for the Brazilian licensing procedures, the winner bid \n\nresults from a combination of three attributes: (1) signature bonus value; (2) minimum exploration \n\nprogram; and (3) local content level. This combination makes the estimation of competition level a \n\nkey issue for decision-makers to strategically define the most competitive offer that could enhance \n\nthe possibility to win the area. \n\n \n\nAchieving more with less requires formulating and deploying sound strategies. Today\u2019s \n\nExploration and Production (E&amp;P) Licensing competition demands excellence both in strategy and \n\nin its execution by senior management to win the bid. One of the most important process for a \n\npetroleum company when planning to participate in an E&amp;P Licensing  acreage is estimate the \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n \n\n  \n\nlevel of competition it should face. As part of a whole decision making process that has long-term \n\nimplications and short time to decide, top managers should consider not only the well known \n\nmathematical techniques, but human perceptions and judgments involved to reach high risk \n\ndecisions. The focus should be on developing a comprehensive methodology for solving strategic \n\nlevel decision making problem which are at present tackled in an ad-hoc manner.  \n\n \n\nThe proposed methodology consist in capturing competitor\u2019s knowledge to build a \n\nmathematical model based on expert system, which should help decision-maker estimate the level \n\nof competition in a licensing sale. The method for capturing expert\u2019s knowledge uses both \n\ninterviews and questionnaires, was developed specifically for this purpose. These tools took into \n\nconsideration aspects raised from the literature that are identified as fundamental on the estimation \n\nof competition level. Having captured these expertise and using a computer program - EXSYS \n\nCORVID\u00ae, based on an expert system, which is a branch of artificial intelligence, it was possible \n\nto develop a knowledge automated expert system using the questionnaires\u00b4 answers to build the \n\nrule-based logic and blocks logic in order to bring the best recommendation, instead of either a \n\nguess or a trivial solution.  \n\n \n\nThe questionnaire, used to investigate the main competition variables, adopted a hypothetical \n\nscenario considering a Brazilian licensing sale for petroleum acreage located at Campos Basin, a \n\nmature offshore sedimentary basin because it has been: (1) offered in eight out of ten licensing \n\nsales held in the country, providing a significant amount of unbiased data on bid results; (2) the \n\noffshore basin with higher number of competitors bidding for areas; and (3) a successful \n\nexploration pool for the last 30 years, presently accounting for around 85% of the total Brazilian \n\npetroleum production, which positively impacts the evaluation companies  have about the areas \n\noffered in each lease sale.  \n\n \n\nThe method applied to estimate competition level for Campos Basin areas in Brazilian leases \n\ntakes into account: (1) the judgment of 36 staff individuals of super-majors, majors and \n\nindependent petroleum companies, positioned at different hierarchy levels; (2) the petroleum \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n \n\n  \n\npotential areas in each lease round; (3) E&amp;P corporate strategies, structure and size of the licensing \n\nqualified companies; and (4) the overall scenario of worldwide E&amp;P activities. \n\n \n\nThe results brought to light by this study allow companies to use a reliable method to \n\nobjectively estimate competition level for Brazilian petroleum lease sale, helping decision-makers \n\nto develop bidding strategies aligned with companies\u2019 exploration portfolio long term strategies. \n\n \n\nThis article is organized in four sections. The first section explains the role of competition in a \n\nlicensing sale, followed by another chapter dedicated to present the methodology developed to help \n\ndecision making estimates the expected level of competition. The third section points out the \n\nresults obtained with the expert\u2019s knowledge captured, which is the base of all research on \n\ncompetition. A set of conclusions wraps up the research project performed and the results \n\nachieved. \n\n \n\n2. The Role of Competition in Petroleum Licensing Environment \n \n\nAuctioning petroleum rights is a game where players take strategic decisions considering \n\nother players\u00b4 behavior, turning competition evaluation into a focal point for bidding strategies. \n\nThe game theory literature contains a number of papers about optimal common value auctions that \n\nmaximize revenues, as well as the importance of the game rules and characteristics of the \n\neconomic environment for equilibrium models. It also assumes that bidder\u2019s private information is \n\nsymmetrically distributed or bidders have no uncertainty over what the auctioned asset is worth to \n\nthem (Porter, 1995).  \n\n    \n\nAccording to Cramtom (2005), offering exploration acreage through auction is advantageous \n\ndue to the tendency this process has to transfer rights and obligations to the most capable \n\ncompanies to explore them. This can be reached through the existing competition among players. \n\nOil companies estimating higher value for a specific area can make a better offer enhancing their \n\nchance to win the willing acreage  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n \n\n  \n\nAnother advantage of competition in sealed bid auctions is to grant the success of the \n\nlicensing process. As stated by Cramtom (op.cit.), highly competitive bids always grant \n\ngovernment higher financial return drift resulting from the success of a sealed bid auction. \n\nWhenever there are more players bidding in the auction game, more amounts of cash signature \n\nbonuses are committed as a result of companies' geological evaluation of available areas. These \n\nbonuses reveal the companies' value for the area, suggesting that competitors are aware of \n\ncompanies' perception which may result in higher offer values in the upcoming auctions. As the \n\nlevel of competition increases, more aggressive optimal bids are offered, leading to the conclusion \n\nthat the best competitive bid could be a good predictor of an asset\u2019s value (Rothkopf &amp; Harstad, \n\n1994) \n\n \n\nDepending on the number of players (competitors), companies risk aversion, technical \n\nexpertise and the economic criteria of each company, the offer presented for each exploration area \n\nreflects a fraction of a market value for each company evaluation, and may vary significantly. \n\n \n\nCompetition is a parameter used by Reece (1979) to evaluate which kind of licensing model \n\ngrants a higher rent of return to the government. He developed a mathematical model using the \n\nnumber of competitors as a variable that represents competition. The assumptions adopted \n\nconsidered that companies are not acting in a \u201ccartelized\u201d manner they focus the maximum rate of \n\nreturn, make independent offers, and know the associated costs of the area they are bidding for. \n\nReece (op.cit.) also assumes identical bidding strategies for all companies. \n\n \n\nAfter analyzing the revenues captured by the government in models based on signature \n\nbonus, profit share and royalty taxes, Reece (op.cit.) concluded that the higher slice of total rent is \n\nobtained when adopting a Production Sharing Contract model and the lowest return is obtained \n\nwith a Signature Bonus model for any number of competitors playing the game. In a Signature \n\nbonus model, from competitors\u2019 side, Capen et al. (1971) suggest that they should present lower \n\noffers whenever there are a higher number of players in a particular petroleum auction to avoid the \n\nwinner\u2019s curse. According to their analyses a higher number of players implies in more acreage \n\nacquired, but with low value spent per area. As the number of players increases, competitors tend \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n \n\n  \n\nto enhance their offers paying higher values than the worth one, consequently letting money on the \n\ntable. Another negative aspect of committing a higher bonus bid is the possibility of winner\u2019s \n\ncurse. According to its technical and economic evaluation one company overestimates forecasted \n\nreserves bidding a higher bonus value for this acreage. E&amp;P activities show results below the \n\nexpected bidding profitability, i.e., the volumes are lower than forecasted causing a lower internal \n\nrate of return. This phenomenon is known as winner\u2019s curse (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic diagram from acreage evaluation up to obtain a proved reserve bearing a \n\nwinner\u2019s curse \n\n \n\nJohnston (1994) states that for a bidder having success on the auction and still have some \n\nprofits with the activities developed over the winner area it should bid below the expected \n\nmonetary value (EMV). The bonus (b) corresponds to a fraction (c) of the EMV (equation 1). This \n\n\u201cc\u201d value (bid fraction) should be comprised between 0 and 1 for EMV values ranging from 0 to \n\n100%.  Capen et alii (1971) assume \u201cc\u201d as representative of a fraction of the market reserve value \n\nthat should vary from 20% to 30% (c=0.2 up to 0.3) due to the area attractiveness, available \n\ninformation and reserve uncertainties to avoid a winner\u2019s curse. \n\nb = c x EMV                                                      (Equation 1) \n\nThe increased competition produces increased allowance for a winner\u2019s curse. According to \n\nRothkopf &amp; Harstad (1994), the winning bidders expect profit to decline approximately as the \n\nsquare of the number of bidders and decreases when estimating accuracy increases.  \n\n \n\nHartsock (1977) developes a mathematical model to help companies with bidding strategies \n\nbased on their behavior on US-GOM tenders. He was looking for answers to questions like: Should \n\na bid combine spend companies leasing budget by bidding very high on a few low-risk area, thus \n\nAcreage \nOffered \n\nOverestimated \nReserve \n\nWinner \nCompany  \n\nReserve Lower \nthan Forecasted \n\nWinner\u2019s \nCurse \n\nTechnical and \n\neconomic evaluation \nHigh Bonus Bid \n\nWorking Program \n\n(PEM) \n\nLower Internal \n\nRate of Return \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n \n\n  \n\nenhancing their chances of winning some area, or should they distribute the budget over more areas \n\nby bidding less on each area while reducing the chances of winning any single area? And, is it \n\nmore beneficial for a company to bid with a group, thereby spreading the risk by reducing the \n\nexpected cost, or should a company bid alone assuming the full risk?   \n\nHoffman et al. (1991) analyze auction games in which companies developed partnership \n\n(consortium) to present only one offer, apparently to share risk capital and information. They use \n\ndirect correlations of an auction measurement and concluded that competition is positively \n\ncorrelated with market variables. Besides this, they observe that variables such as \"number of \n\ncompetitors\" and \"number of offers\" should be considered independently one from another when \n\nanalyzing auction results in order not to mask the game comprehension. \n\n \n\nLiterature widely states that companies pool to split technical risk and commit more cash \n\nvalue for the offer (Iledare et al., 2004; Saidi &amp; Marsden, 1992). Hoffman et al. (1991) observe a \n\npositive correlation between the number of players (company presenting offer in a licensing sale) \n\nand the number of consortium attesting that making a joint bidding offer not necessarily reduces \n\nthe total number of players presenting offer. Repsold (2003) points out that consortium have a \n\ntendency to unify the proposals toward the higher one, and to, along time, disclose companies \n\ntechniques and strategies, allowing an important knowledge on competitors behavior. Conversely, \n\nRothkopf &amp; Harstad (1994) conclude that firms have concern about revealing information to rivals \n\nthat will create disadvantages during the current auction and they may go to great effort to withhold \n\nprivate information which is a key to future bidding profitability.  \n\n \n\nSaidi &amp; Marsden (op.cit.) identify that consortia formed through the association of two, \n\nthree, or even four companies presenting one offer for a specific area, tend to be the winner against \n\noffers made by sole companies. Consortium could associate companies with different profiles and \n\nfinancial support, allowing more competitive offers that could result in the area acquisition with a \n\nlower capital exposition for each company. In this sense, consortium can be considered more \n\naggressive enhancing the likelihood to win their higher priority acreage or buying higher number of \n\nlow priority areas with considerable money left on the table. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n \n\n  \n\nEmphasizing that companies participating in a petroleum exploration licensing are: a) serious \n\nand competent for doing E&amp;P activities; b) legal, technical and financially qualified for the \n\nlicensing; and c) have a firm intention to present offers and acquire acreage aligned with their \n\nstrategies; divergence of opinions among competitors could result from reasons such as the \n\nexistence of information. \n\n \n\nPorter (1995) discuss the role of information in the Outer Continental Shelf lease sales, and \n\nposted that it can play a crucial role in auctions, as information level varies among competitors. \n\nPart of the information is available for all players, but others are restricted to few companies. The \n\navailable information is called public, and is generally sold by the regulatory agency for the players \n\ninterested in making an offer which shall pay for the geological data. The restricted or private \n\ninformation one is known only by the companies performing E&amp;P activities around the area \n\noffered in the licensing. In this sense it is right to state that public information generates symmetry \n\namong competitors while private one, creates an asymmetry which is favorable for the well \n\ninformed company (Tavares, 2000). \n\n \n\nReece (1979) observes that in licensing where players have the same level of information, i. \n\ne., only symmetric information, companies tend to obtain similar values for the auctioned area, and \n\ngovernment revenue fractions are higher than the competitors, independent of the licensing model \n\napplied. For Sunnev\u00e5g (2000), to estimate competition through the number of competitors is \n\nirrelevant when only public information is available. In petroleum licensing with asymmetric \n\ninformation, companies\u00b4 evaluation may vary significantly, resulting in different values for the \n\nasset auctioned. The strategic variable, in this case, is the number of companies possessing private \n\ndata. Therefore, any asymmetric information is a competitive advantage for one company over the \n\nothers, enhancing its possibility to make profits. \n\n \n\nIt is reasonable to consider that information has a fundamental role in reducing uncertainties \n\non acreage technical and economic evaluation. Companies with more data and knowledge can \n\nmake more precise evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of an area, and decision-makers feel \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n \n\n  \n\nmore confident in ranking the areas they will bid for, and how much should be committed as \n\nsignature bonus for each one. \n\n \n\nAlthough all the authors above mentioned agree that the three more important variables to \n\nanalyze competition in a licensing round are: a) the area auctioned, b) the qualified companies, and \n\nc) the available information; in general, they developed their mathematical models for bidding \n\noptimization. Academics are interested in a methodology that could give a better offer estimation \n\nto win the bid paying as less as possible to not left money on the table. Competition is mainly \n\nevaluated from a revenue return point of view.  \n\n \n\nThe purpose of this study is, using these three main variables, estimate the expected level of \n\ncompetition in a Brazilian licensing sale. \n\n \n\n3. Research Methods and Methodology to Estimate Competition Level \n \n\nThe main purpose of this study is to estimate the expected level of competition in a particular \n\npetroleum exploration licensing sale, based on the capture of experts knowledge which are directly \n\ninvolved in the decision making process. These experts are the ones who define the most \n\ncompetitive offer that could result in winning the bid for the specific acreage.  \n\n \n\nDespite the fact that professionals of the oil industry usually do not document the way they \n\nestimate competition in the specialized literature, all companies participating in an E&amp;P \n\ncompetitive bid perform competitive analyses. Artificial intelligence and Operational Research \n\nmethods (OR) can be pointed out as the most common methods applied. \n\n \n\nDifferent from the standard optimization techniques, which are appropriate to solve problems \n\nfor predictable environments, deterministic behavior of people, or for small and narrow contents - \n\nthe multi-criteria decision making process have been studied under the general classification of OR \n\nproblems. Its purpose is to deal with taking decisions in the presence of a number of often \n\nconflicting criteria, and is divided into two groups: multi-objective and multi-attribute decision \n\nmaking (Bhushan &amp; Rai, 2004). As multi-attribute deals with discrete decision spaces, where \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n \n\n  \n\ndecision alternatives are predetermined, two analytical methods were tested to estimate the level of \n\ncompetition: 1) the weighted sum method (WSM), and 2) the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). \n\nWSM is a decision matrix approach used to evaluate each alternative with respect to each criterion \n\nand then multiplies that evaluation by the importance of the criterion. AHP is a structured \n\ntechnique for dealing with complex decisions. Rather than prescribing a \"correct\" decision, AHP \n\nhelps decision-makers find the one that best suits their needs and their understanding of the \n\nproblem (Saaty, 2008). Despite that these methods catch some characteristics of the decision \n\nmaking process, both AHP and WSM do not reach reliable results, but allow a better understanding \n\nof the decision making process and the variables involved. They do not capture the decision-maker \n\njudgment, which is a fundamental element when analyzing competition. Some of those methods \n\ndeal with preferences that differ from judgment, a cognitive aspect of the decision making process \n\n(Bazerman, 2006). \n\n \n\nAs artificial Intelligence encompasses many aspects of human behavior such as speech, \n\nlanguage, movement, among others, knowledge automation expert systems - a branch of Artificial \n\nIntelligence, which focuses on the capture and dissemination of problem solving knowledge via \n\ncomputer programs \u2013 tends to be a powerful tool for estimation of the level of competition. These \n\nexpert systems are used to advise, diagnose, or troubleshoot problems that were once only \n\nperformed by humans. This option will be used by this research project. \n\n \n\nThe method adopted by this research to collect data can be divided into two groups: \n\nquantitative or qualitative research, and deskwork or fieldwork. Among the existing research \n\napproaches, surveys were adopted to collect data by asking pre-established questions in a specific \n\norder to a group of individuals who are representative of a targeted population. This research \n\nproject applies two types of survey: questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Questionnaires, as observed by Blaxter et al. (1996, in: Asrilhant, 2001), are one of the most \n\ncommonly used research techniques in the social sciences. They are mainly used for collecting \n\nprimary data, whether they are quantitative or qualitative. Questionnaires are usually posted, \n\nbut they can also be administered by telephone, e-mail or face-to-face. Questionnaires must \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n \n\n  \n\ninvolve properly framed questions, so that the respondents can clearly and unequivocally \n\nunderstand them. A researcher must also test and amend a questionnaire before its \n\nadministration. There are two formats of questions: closed and open-ended. A type of closed \n\nquestion is the forced-choice question. This allows the respondents to select one or more \n\nresponses from an exhaustive and mutually exclusive list of alternatives. The other type of \n\nclosed question uses a response options format. Finally, open-ended questions allow for free \n\nanswers; \n\n\u2022 Interviews, another research technique, represent an extensively applied method of \n\ninvestigating the participants\u2019 experiences, perspectives and understandings in some depth. \n\nInterviews are categorized into different formats, such as structured, semi-structured or \n\nunstructured. A structured interview is a formal instrument based on an interview schedule. It \n\ncomprehends a set of clear instructions, and questions are asked in a specific order. The semi-\n\nstructured interview is less formal, including open-ended questions. Questions are not posed in \n\na rigid order, and can be re-worded for a specific interview. Unstructured interviews do no \n\nimpose clear rules. They are based on an interview agenda where open-ended questions are \n\ndeveloped during the interviews (Clarke and Dawson, 1999a, in: Asrilhant, 2001). \n\nThe proposed research methodology is divided into three phases: 1) the exploratory \n\ninvestigation, (2) the knowledge capture, and (3) the expert system development. The methodology \n\nbegan with a qualitative approach. A set of semi-structured, preliminary face-to-face interviews \n\nwere carried out to give a sense of reality to the research problem, motivate the design of the next \n\nsteps of the proposed research methodology and support the reviewed literature to describe the \n\nresearch hypotheses. The exploratory investigation was followed by a quantitative approach. A \n\nquestionnaire, which was the main source of data in the current study, tested the research \n\nhypothesis, generalized the exploratory findings, consolidated the overall findings, and supported \n\nthe development of the logic base rules to build the expert system model. Finally, a computer work \n\nwas performed based on the principles of artificial intelligence incorporating the expert knowledge \n\ncaptured by the questionnaire to help decision-makers estimate the level of competition. In this \n\nresearch project, the presence of the interviewee during the questionnaire application was \n\nfundamental to explore relevant issues that could give more details regarding the issues \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n \n\n  \n\ninvestigated by the questionnaire. Table 1 summarizes the phases of the proposed research \n\nmethodology. \n\n \n\n3.1 Exploratory Investigation \n\n \n\nThe exploratory investigation consisted of the pilot testing of the questionnaire. It was set as \n\na transition from theory to method which relates and checks theory with practice, as a prototype of \n\nthe core investigation, and motivated the design of the next phases of the current research \n\nmethodology. The exploratory investigation was performed in two stages: (1) exploratory \n\ndeskwork, and (2) exploratory fieldwork (Table 2). The exploratory deskwork aimed to seek a \n\ncorrespondence between the elements obtained from theory and practice, defining the set of main \n\nelements to be placed within a conceptual framework. The exploratory fieldwork is the part of the \n\nresearch dedicated to obtain from experts their consent on the deskwork mapped variables. The \n\ndefinition of fieldwork should consider the current fast technological evolution aggregating such a \n\nkind of work done virtually, such as telephone interviews and e-mailed questionnaires. \n\n \n\nTABLE 1 - Research Methodology Phases \n\nPhase \n\n \n\nNumber  Denomination \n\nResearch Techniques Objectives Period  \n\nI Exploratory \n\nInvestigation \n\nSemi-structured \n\npreliminary interviews \n\nTo define the relevant elements \n\nin practice and theory to design \n\na questionnaire for competition \n\nlevel estimation \n\nFebruary to  \n\nSeptember, 2009 \n\nII Knowledge \n\nCapture \n\nSemi-structured face-to-\n\nface and emailed \n\nquestionnaire \n\nTo identify the logic reasoning \n\nbehind experts\u00b4 judgments on \n\ncompetition level \n\nNovember, 2009 to \n\nFebruary, 2010 \n\nIII Building an \n\nExpert System \n\nComputer program based \n\non artificial intelligence \n\nthat uses blocks logic and \n\nrule-based logic \n\nTo build an automated system \n\nthat represents experts\u00b4 \n\nthoughts on competition to help \n\nthe decision making process. \n\nJanuary to June, 2010 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nTABLE 2 \u2013 Exploratory Investigation Stages \n\nStage \n\nNumber Denomination \n\nResearch Techniques Objectives Period \n\nI Exploratory \n\nDeskwork \n\nTheory Analysis Definition of a set of relevant \n\nelements both corresponding in \n\ntheory and practice \n\nAugust, 2008 to \n\nJanuary, 2009 \n\nII Exploratory \n\nFieldwork \n\nFace-to-face and virtual \n\ninterviews. Semi-structured \n\nquestionnaire prototype \n\nTo collect experts perception on \n\nthe variables and the level of \n\ncompetition  \n\nFebruary, 2009 to \n\nJune, 2010 \n\n \n\n \n\nExploratory Deskwork \n\n \n\nThe exploratory deskwork target was to search for the identification of a set of relevant \n\nelements from the literature and seek a correspondence between theory and practice. The elements \n\nshould be supported by the literature to ensure their completeness and credibility in order to be \n\neffective and acceptable. Elements must be carefully examined in order to assess the extent to \n\nwhich they are included, and whether any element should be combined, eliminated or re-stated, \n\nalong with the examination of potential interrelationships amongst them.  \n\n \n\nWidely discussed by the theory presented in Section 2, the elements identified were grouped \n\nin four main sets. The first one is related to the importance of the geological and economic \n\npotential of the area been offered in a particular tender (prospectivity, proximity to existing \n\nproduction facilities, among others). The second set refers to possible competitors (number of \n\nqualified companies, strategies, past tender behavior, E&amp;P activities in the basin, among others). \n\nThe third group focuses on information (symmetric or asymmetric, amount and quality, confidence \n\non information source). The last category holds joint bidding arrangements envisaging area \n\nacquisition. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n \n\n  \n\nThese necessary and sufficient sets of relevant elements for the estimation of competition \n\nlevel in decision making process are the basis for the exploratory fieldwork, which follows. \n\n \n\nExploratory Fieldwork  \n\n \n\nThe main purpose of the exploratory fieldwork is to check and calibrate the elements \n\nidentified for estimating the level of competition in E&amp;P licensing acreage. Interviewing experts, \n\nwhose knowledge rose from the business world of upstream oil and gas sector, helped achieve this \n\npurpose. \n\n \n\nThe exploratory fieldwork was conducted interviewing eight professionals of the upstream \n\noil and gas industry. It was carried out doing seven semi-structured face-to-face interviews and one \n\ne-mailed questionnaire for group of decision-makers holding top, medium and junior positions \n\n(two executive directors, two senior advisors, two business consultants, and two technicians). Each \n\ninterview lasted, on average, one hour. The relevant elements and their operational definitions were \n\nproduced, based on the ranking of the most important elements, such as: (1) the geological \n\npotential of auctioned asset, (2) the total number of companies qualified and their E&amp;P profile; and \n\n(3) the available information on companies\u00b4 E&amp;P strategies. During the questionnaire testing a \n\nsecond round of contact was conducted by e-mailing the questionnaire to four professionals, \n\namong the eight previously interviewed. This second approach supported the re-examination of the \n\nproposed set of elements and the possible interrelationships amongst them, helping the design of \n\nthe final version of the questionnaire.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Knowledge Capture \n \n \n\nThis is the core investigation methodology on this research and consisted of design and \n\nadministration of a questionnaire. \n\n \n\nAccording to Awad (2003), knowledge is human understanding of a specialized field of \n\ninterest that has been acquired through experience and study. Davenport and Prusak (2000) define \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n \n\n  \n\nknowledge as a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, and expert insight \n\nthat provides a framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. \n\nHence, a knowledge base is a set of facts and inference rules for determining new information and \n\n\u201csmarter\u201d knowledge to support decision making. It is not a simply database. It is an understanding \n\ngained through study that includes perception, skills, training, common sense, and experience.  \n\n \n\nIntelligent behavior implies the ability to understand and use language and store and access \n\nrelevant experience. Humans acquire expertise, learnt via experience. Expertise incorporates the \n\nability to reason and make deductions as well as common sense (unreflective opinions of ordinary \n\nhuman beings). Knowledge is neither data nor information. Although it is related to both, it \n\nembraces a wider sphere than information. Data are unorganized and unprocessed facts. \n\nInformation has meaning, purpose and relevance. Therefore, evaluated data becomes information \n\nwhen meaning or value is added to improve the quality of decision making.  \n\n \n\nA questionnaire is the main tool to capture expert\u2019s knowledge in the domain of competition \n\nfor petroleum acreage acquisition. It must be able to address the research question, test the research \n\nhypothesis, and catch respondents\u00b4 know-how to support the building of an expert system for \n\nexpected level of competition estimation helping decision-makers elaborate the strategies to \n\nenhance their companies chances to win the bid. The questionnaire aimed to identify: (1) the \n\nelements to which decision-makers pay considerable attention while estimating competition level; \n\n(2) the inter-relationship among these elements; (3) the level of expected competition; and (4) \n\ndecision-makers opinion about competition level and the licensing model applied by government. \n\n \n\nThe knowledge capture comprised three stages. The first stage was the questionnaire design, \n\nwhich consisted of four steps: (1) sampling procedure; (2) questionnaire structure; (3) \n\nmeasurement and operational definition of the research variables; and (4) questionnaire reliability \n\nand validity. The second stage referred to the questionnaire administration, which consisted of \n\nthree steps: (1) primary access; (2) pilot testing; and (3) main survey.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n \n\n  \n\nQuestionnaire Design \n\n \n\nIt describes the sampling procedure, as observed by Chou (1998), refers to the selection of a \n\nsubject from a population of interest. The sampling procedure is divided into four areas of \n\nconsideration: (1) unit of analysis; (2) sample size; (3) sample frame; and (4) sample design, as \n\ndiscussed in the following. This research project aims to estimate the level of competition to be \n\nused in a decision making process to define the most competitive offer for a specific area in a \n\npetroleum exploration lease. Sample size is an important step in the sampling procedure. The \n\nassumption of normality is, according to Hair et al. (1997), an influential constraint in dealing with \n\nbasic statistics. The characteristics of the distribution (e.g. mean and standard deviation) and t- and \n\nF-tests are generally based on the premise of a normal distribution. According to the Central Limit \n\nTheorem, a sample size of at least thirty observations is necessary to take normality for granted. \n\nSamples with less than thirty observations are considered small and require special tests to \n\ndetermine statistically significant findings. \n\n \n\nThis project research has a sample size of thirty-six valid observations. The sample frame \n\nrefers to the identification and description of the targeted population. The focal population of this \n\nstudy is the Brazilian upstream oil and gas sector. The selection of the representative companies of \n\nthe population was based on two complementary criteria: (1) concessionaires of E&amp;P offshore \n\nareas; and (2) corporate structure and size. The concessionaire criteria was based on the number of \n\ncurrent companies technically qualified by the petroleum regulatory agency to explore and produce \n\noil and gas offshore Brazil. Consulting the petroleum regulatory agency data base (ANP, 2010) the \n\nnumber of current 77 concessionaires could be split into 46 companies performing onshore \n\nactivities and, 31 operators or partners for E&amp;P shallow or deepwater areas. A total number of 20 \n\noffshore concessionaires was sampled corresponding to 65% of the total oil and gas companies \n\ncurrently working offshore Brazil. The second criterion was used to pick up those 20 \n\nconcessionaires according to their corporate structure and size. Six groups were formed to be \n\nrepresentative of the diversity profile of companies and Public or Government Agencies operating \n\nin the Brazilian petroleum upstream sector: Super Majors, American Independents, International \n\nOil Companies, Domestic Companies, and International Regional Companies. \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nAs it occurs in most of the companies, the decision making process is generally done by \n\nmore than one expert directly involved in the competition evaluation, it is important to sample as \n\nmuch experts as possible to obtain different judgments on competition. On the other hand, as \n\npetroleum licensing is a competitive process and any piece of information is considered to be a \n\ncompetitive advantage, experts must be confident on an interviewee\u2019s ethical behavior. This \n\nresearch surveyed 36 experts, which were assured confidentiality by not disclosing their particular \n\nand professional identities, opinions and name of companies surveyed. Only the findings of this \n\nstudy are to be published as a whole. \n\n \n\nThe main purpose of the questionnaire applied in this study is to capture how experts \n\nestimate competition level on a Concession Contract Licensing model. Considering that there were \n\nno existing questionnaires available for this purpose, the current questionnaire was an useful \n\nexploratory, descriptive instrument. The structure of the ten-page questionnaire consists of: a) \n\ncover letter, including a guidance for completing the questionnaire and a hypothetical petroleum \n\nexploration licensing round scenario; b) three sections of closed questions, and c) a fourth section \n\ncomprised of one open-ended question. The guidance for completing the questionnaire included \n\nthe aims of the research, fixed values and numbers of some discretionary variables in order to \n\nrestrict the universe of dependent variables and some variables' definitions. When presenting the \n\nquestionnaire face-to-face, the interviewee usually stated that they only need to answer questions \n\nwhich were relevant to them, and, if they had not been involved in any petroleum competitive \n\nbidding process they could either introduce the interviewee to another expert or forward the \n\nquestionnaire to someone who had been involved with this subject. \n\n \n\nThe questionnaire is structured in three main sections related to the three most important \n\nissues to be evaluated in competition level estimation: a) information; b) acreage; and c) \n\ncompanies\u2019 profile. The first section of the questionnaire referred to the companies qualified for \n\nthe licensing bid sale. The idea of this part is to capture expert judgment about the identification of \n\npotential competitors they could face according to their financial position and strategies for that \n\nspecific licensing sale. The second section referred to the areas on offer by the regulatory agency in \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\n  \n\nthe specified mature sedimentary basin. The purpose of the third section was to assess how \n\ninformation affects the competition level evaluation. These three sections also contain questions \n\nthat mix the subjects, i.e., questions involving potential area with information, and/or number of \n\npotential competitors. The rationale behind these questions was to investigate the inter-\n\nrelationships of those variables and how they may change expert's perception on the competition \n\nlevel. The fourth section, composed by just one open-ended question, envisaged to capture the \n\nindustry perception on how the new regulatory policies could impact the level of competition in the \n\nnew Brazilian licensing model such as the Production Sharing Contract, under government \n\nanalysis. Finally, respondents were advised that the research findings will be published after \n\nanalyzed, and respondents will be notified about the publication.   \n\n \n\nA total number of 25 multiple-choice questions plus some related questions were considered \n\nin the questionnaire. The multiple-choice type questions are either excludent (yes or no questions) \n\nor ranking scale questions. According to DeVellis (1991, in: Asrilhant, 2001), there are several \n\nformats for the scale items, such as the binary and the semantic differential, which are applied in \n\nthis study and briefly discussed here. The binary scale involves a \u201cyes-no\u201d format, and the semantic \n\ndifferential scales adopt a five response options.  \n\n \n\nBesides obtaining relevant information, another main goal of a questionnaire design is to \n\ncollect this information with maximum reliability and validity (Warwick and Linninger, 1975 in: \n\nKey, 1997), because in scientific research accuracy is of great importance. Generally, scientific \n\nresearches measure physical attributes, to which precise values can be assigned. As this study deals \n\nwith experts\u2019 knowledge it is essential to remind that values assigned to mental attributes can never \n\nbe completely precise. The related imprecision is often looked upon as being too small to be of a \n\npractical concern. However, the magnitude of imprecision is much greater in the measurement of \n\nmental attributes than in that of physical attributes. This fact turns very the determination of the \n\nreliability of a measuring instrument (Willmott and Nuttall, 1975 in: Key, 1997).   \n\n\u2022 Reliability is the tendency toward consistency found in repeated measurements, as defined by \n\nCarmines and Zeller (1979). A reliable research instrument is the one that yields the same \n\nresults on repeated trials. Although unreliability is always present to a certain extent, \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n \n\n  \n\nconsistency could be reached with the results of a quality instrument gathered at different \n\ntimes. There are three main methods for measuring the reliability of an instrument: retest, \n\nalternative, and internal consistent (Key, 1997). Although pilot testing increase the consistency \n\nof the questionnaire, two administrations of the same instrument for a small group was \n\nperformed to compare their past and present responses allowing the measurement of a \n\nreliability coefficient. The retest method was applied to 20% of the previous participants, and \n\nthe average index of reliability reached 77%, proving the questionnaire design to be reliabie; \n\n\u2022 Validity is the extent to which a measuring instrument measures what is supposed to measure \n\nand can be checked through three basic approaches: content, criterion-related and construct \n\nvalidity (Carmines and Zeller, 1979). The content validity measures the degree to which the test \n\nitems represent the domain of the trait been measured. It is strongly suggested to use a panel of \n\nexperts in the field to be studied to identify a content area (Key, 1997). Interviews during the \n\nexploratory fieldwork and the pilot testing of the questionnaire done with some experts \n\ncontributed to checking the questionnaire\u2019s content validity. The current questionnaire is \n\nbelieved to have sound content validity. \n\nThe total amount of 36 questionnaires was responded by qualified experts and is reliable and \n\nvalid for the purpose of this research project. \n\n \n\nQuestionnaire Administration \n\n \n\nIt is appropriated to state that obtaining a significant number of potential respondents who \n\nwould be willing to answer the questionnaire was a critical issue in this research. As the first \n\nauthor of this paper is an expert involved for more than ten years analyzing competition and \n\npartnerships developed in Brazilian E&amp;P acreage sales it was straightforward to establish a list of \n\ncontact and invite qualified professionals in a wide range of companies to participate in this \n\nresearch. Some experts that are doing similar business all over the world were also contacted and \n\nfreely accepted to contribute in both pilot test and questionnaire administration phases. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\n  \n\n        The methods or tools chosen for knowledge capture is not a straightforward routine, and \n\ndepend on the nature, personality and attitude of the expert and whether the expert system will be \n\nbuilt around a single or multiple experts, both have advantages and limitations. In spite of a single \n\nor multiple expert interviews the knowledge developer should be aware of different levels of \n\nexpertise that influence communication quality. Higher level experts generally give concise \n\nexplanations, but often skipping vital details. Moderate level experts tend to provide detailed \n\nexplanations, being quick to give answers. Conversely, new experts tend to offer brief, fragmented \n\nanswers, suggesting shallow knowledge. One possibility to improve knowledge capture by the \n\ndeveloper is eliciting an expert\u2019s knowledge through concrete case situations or scenarios.  \n\n \n\nIn this study the choice was to capture knowledge by applying a face-to-face questionnaire \n\nfor multiple experts with different levels of knowledge, working for a wide range of petroleum \n\ncompanies, such as international oil companies, majors, and government agencies, among others.  \n\n \n\nThe tactic adopted was to contact experts that have already done business together in, at \n\nleast, one of the ten previous Brazilian E&amp;P Licensing Sales. Nineteen individuals invited by \n\nphone calls freely accepted to contribute with this research project. Eight were also selected to \n\nparticipate in the pilot testing of the questionnaire. These experts work for different oil companies \n\nand hold diverse positions on the hierarchy. Acting respect and trustfully with the research project, \n\nthey recommended other experts working inside their companies or even working for other oil \n\ncompanies and/or petroleum institutions. A total number of 36 experts responded the \n\nquestionnaire, and five refused to participate in the research, despite their awareness of the identity \n\nprivacy and disclosing information policy of the project. The knowledge developer built a \n\nhypothetic scenario, presented in the questionnaire which was, even for the different companies, \n\nsubject to the same boundary conditions in order to narrow the possibility of widening answers.  \n\n \n\nThe adopted scenario considered a fixed oil price, knowing licensing date and period, and \n\ndetermined number and profile of qualified companies that could potentially bid for areas in a \n\npetroleum mature sedimentary basin, such as Campos Basin. Data like oil price, fiscal system, \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n \n\n  \n\namong others were set fixed to avoid considering economic and political risks that could imply in \n\nspread responses out. \n\n \n\nThe thirty-six questionnaires were grouped according to companies\u00b4 corporate structure \n\n(Figure 2), meaning that, out of the twenty companies surveyed, 10% of the total number of \n\nquestionnaires was responded by Super Majors workers, 15% from American Independents, 15% \n\nfrom Public or Government Agencies, 15% from International Regional Companies, 20% from \n\nBrazilian Companies and 25% from International Oil Companies. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Distribution of the 20 petroleum companies and government entities surveyed. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 presents the distribution of respondents within the 20 petroleum companies and \n\nagencies. Three out of five pieces of the graphic show a percentage around 20% consultants, \n\ntechnicians and directors collaborating in this project. The smaller fraction corresponds to the \n\namount of CEOs listened (11%) and the greatest proportion is represented by the managers sample \n\n(29%).  \n\n \n\nListening to a wide range of view points allows the knowledge developer to consider \n\nalternative ways of representing knowledge. An additional advantage was that scheduling a formal \n\nmeeting frequently creates a better environment for generating thoughtful contributions. However, \n\nthe greater the number of participants involved, the harder to retain confidentiality and get a \n\nconsensus opinion, which could jeopardize the success of the survey. The method used to approach \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n \n\n  \n\nexperts was based on individuals formal meetings, believing that it could guarantee enough privacy \n\nto experts freely share information and answer the questionnaire, besides building up a trustful lie \n\nbetween expert and knowledge developer based on ethical behavior. The option to present the \n\nsame questionnaire for all interviewees aims to avoid noise and uncertainties on the information \n\ncaptured granting a better translation of experts\u2019 judgment into logic rules. Another benefit of a \n\nstructured interview is to eliminate experts\u2019 bias getting the same understanding through a \n\nstandardized questionnaire, which ensures its validity and comparability. \n\n \n\nIndividuals are imperfect information processors tending to form a preference for one \n\noutcome justifying this preference on a fair basis. This introduces to the decision making process a \n\nbias according to their self-interest. What should be an impartial judgment than become an \n\nunconscious and powerful systematic bias leading the decision making process to fail (Bazerman, \n\n2006). Understanding and limiting this bias in judgment could break some decision making \n\npatterns avoiding mistakes when taking decisions. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Distribution per group of the 36 specialists on Brazilian petroleum licensing \n\nparticipating on the research. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n \n\n  \n\n \n3.3 Building an Expert System \n \n\nThis step of the methodology is a confirmatory investigation phase. The knowledge capture is \n\nthe investigative experimental process, involving interviews and protocol analysis, used to build a \n\nknowledge automation expert system, which consists of: \n\n\u2022 Using an appropriate tool to elicit information from an expert \u2013 the questionnaire; \n\n\u2022 Interpreting the information and inferring an expert\u2019s underlying knowledge and reasoning \nprocess; and \n\n\u2022 Using the interpretation to build the rules that represent an expert\u2019s thought processes or \nsolutions. \n\nGenerally, academics suggest that a knowledge automation expert system aims to learn how an \n\nexpert\u2019s mind works and how tough problems are conceived. It is also viewed as an engineering \n\napproach to problem solving using rules of thumb. Psychologists believe that rely heavily on \n\nmodeling human cognition. Such a program normally uses rules of thumb (heuristics) described as \n\nlogical statements to capture the decision making processes of the human expert (Awad, 2003). \n\n \n\nThe goal was to design a computer-based system that could capture and emulate a human \n\ndecision making process. A machine that can work as well as a skilled human been. However, the \n\ndistinction is that computer software can perform only that task and cannot handle new situations \n\nthat require innovation or intuition. Expert systems tend to be more effective than other computer \n\nbased applications, because they:  \n\n\u2022 may combine the knowledge of many experts in a specific field; \n\n\u2022 can store an unlimited amount of information, and works much faster, than a human;  \n\n\u2022 are  available 24 hours, and can be used at a distance over a network;  \n\n\u2022 are able to explain their information requests and suggestions;  \n\n\u2022 can process a client's uncertain responses and, by combining several pieces of uncertain \ninformation, may be able to make good recommendations; and \n\n\u2022 can accumulate the knowledge of high level employees for any company, which is  especially \nuseful  when they retire or leave company.  \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n \n\n  \n\nAlthough an expert system includes several key components (Figure 4), the essential one is the \n\nknowledge base - an organized collection of facts, heuristics and other information on the subject \n\nof a system's domain. An expert system is built in a process known as knowledge engineering, \n\nduring which knowledge about the domain is acquired essentially from human experts. The part of \n\nthe expert system that applies the knowledge to the problem's solving is called the inference \n\nengine. The explanation system explains the basis for the conclusion, reached by the expert system.  \n\n \n\nThe intellectual editor is a tool for correction, learning or self learning of the knowledge base. \n\nA friendly user interface enables inexperienced users to specify problems for the system to solve \n\nand understand the system's conclusions. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Key components of an expert system based on the judgment view (knowledge-based) of \n\npetroleum experts on competitive in petroleum lease acreage.  \n\n \n\nAiming to verify if this methodology could be applied to estimate the level of competition for \n\nE&amp;P acreage acquisition, a method for capture expert knowledge was developed in order to build \n\nan expert system. \n\n \n\nThe first step to build an expert system is to identify the problem domain to be solved. If the \n\nproblem requires years of experience and cognitive reasoning to solve, or should be considered a \n\njudgment maker rather than a calculation processor then, the domain is a qualified candidate for \n\nexpert system methodology. The second one, and most important, is to capture tacit knowledge by \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n \n\n  \n\nknowledge developers who should have an understanding of an expert\u2019s level of expertise (Awad, \n\n2003). \n\n \n\nOne of the features of a knowledge expert system is to transform information into practical \n\nadvice. Hence, it is a powerful methodology to handle complex decision making processes, as it is \n\na competitive estimation for a particular petroleum licensing. \n\n \n\nExsys Corvid\u00ae was the computer platform elected to build the expert system. It provides tree \n\nstructures to organize related rules, and logic blocks to organize the related trees. When \n\ninterviewing the experts, the knowledge developer should be directly related to the amount of time \n\nused to capture and convert knowledge into rules that computers can use. The decision making \n\nlogic is stated by \u201cif/then\u201d rules, in the same way as explaining to another person how to make a \n\ndecision. \n\n \n\nThe software applied uses an \"object-structure\" approach to design the system. Rules are \n\ndefined using various types of variables that have related methods and properties, providing a wide \n\nrange of flexibility and power. Some advantages of a full object-oriented approach are provided \n\nwithout having to understand complex programming, or describing a solution with many classes. \n\nThis is similar to the concept used in Visual Basic, widely used and accepted. The object-\n\nstructured nature of this software allows it to provide the optimum balance between power, \n\nflexibility and use. \n\n \n\nThe software inference engine runs the rules. It supports both backward \u201cgoal driven\u201d and \n\nforward \u201cdata driven\u201d chaining, or combinations of the two approaches. Backward chaining makes \n\nit particularly easy to build systems. If a system has a rule relevant to the current goal or variable, it \n\nwill be automatically found and used by the system. All developer has to do is to add the rules \n\nanywhere in the system. Questions will be focused, only asking what is needed, yet never \n\noverlooking anything that might be relevant, combining and analyzing the user information, and \n\ndisplaying the system recommendations. Probabilistic logic (\"fuzzy logic\") is supported with many \n\nways to combine confidence factors, allowing systems to find the \"best\" solution, and \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n \n\n  \n\nprobabilistically rank multiple possible solutions. Despite this power, the inference engine is small \n\nand efficient. \n\n \n\nThe knowledge automated expert system built as a result of this research is valid under a \n\nspecific scenario stated at the beginning of the questionnaire to restrict the wideness of possible \n\nanswers and different interpretations. The assumptions adopted refer to some bidding \n\ncharacteristics, as listed in Annex 1. \n\n \n\nThe creation of a knowledge base consisted in transforming an expert\u2019s knowledge acquired \n\nby the questionnaire into variables and rules which allow the inference engine to run the command \n\nblock for estimating the level of competition. A total of 14 variables was defined assuming static or \n\nnumeric values. Some of them have their values set by the user while running the software. As it is \n\nan automated program, it interacts with users searching for those answers. The variables \n\ndescription, including questions made by the program, is displayed in Annex 1.  \n\n \n\nThese variables are used by the knowledge developer to build in the \u201cif/then\u201d format rules. \n\nEach group of rules represents a logic block built according to each aspect of the licensing should \n\nbe under analysis. In this study, five logic blocks were built: 1) petroleum price scenario; 2) \n\nnumber and profile of competitors; 3) acreage attractiveness; 4) strategic information available; \n\nand 5) estimation of competition level. Annex 1 also shows the name and details for each logic \n\nblock built. Annex 2 presents the method applied specifically to the logic block \n\nESTIMA_COMPET to help the knowledge developer to structure 72 logic rules, representing all \n\npossible licensing cases, each of them resulting in one of the three levels of competition. \n\n \n\nOnce the logic blocks are built it is imperative to structure the inference engine \u2013 a group of \n\ncommands to perform the competition estimation. Although Awad (2003) has mentioned the use of \n\nbackward chaining as the most applied procedure while building an expert system, this study\u2019s \n\nexpected results were achieved applying forward chaining. Figure 5 is the image of Exsys Corvid\u00ae \n\ncommand block constructed to estimate the level of competition for the Brazilian Licensing. This \n\nroutine ask for both variables and logic blocks, in a sequence defined by the knowledge developer, \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n \n\n  \n\nto run the software using forward rules procedures to calculate: 1) the number of competitors, 2) \n\nthe area attractiveness, 3) the effect of strategic information over competition, and 4) the level of \n\ncompetition. Any user answering the question posed by the software can fast and easily reach the \n\nresults. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Exsys Corvid\u00ae Command block image executed while running the software. This \n\nroutine gives the result on the expected level of competition. \n\n \n\n4. Results for Brazilian Competitive Lease Sales \n \n \n\nIn 1997, after almost 45 years of monopoly of petroleum E&amp;P activities performed by the \n\nNational Oil Company - Petrobras, the Brazilian Government established a new petroleum fiscal \n\nregime in the country. It sanctioned the Petroleum Law 9.478/97, and also created the Petroleum \n\nNational Agency (ANP) to regulate upstream and downstream activities. ANP adopted a \n\nConcession Contract model to transfer E&amp;P from Federal Union to oil companies. The \n\nGovernment is the subsurface natural resources\u00b4 owner and concessionaires are the production \n\nowners. Government take and free commercialization of the hydrocarbon produced are both \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n \n\n  \n\nconcessionaires\u00b4 obligations and rights. This right is one of the concession model rules that mostly \n\nattract the oil industry attention. \n\n \n\nSince 1999, with oil prices raising, the Brazilian Government slice of petroleum revenues has \n\nincreased and the public debt has started its decline, positively impacting the government budget, \n\nreaching 0.76% of the 2006 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Figure 6). According to Santos \n\n(2009), this is the best criterion to evaluate the success of the new institutional system established \n\nby the Petroleum Law. \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Evolution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Government Take from petroleum \n\nrevenues since 1994. The increasing of Government Take after 1998 reflects the change from a \n\nroyalty tax based fiscal system to a mix of royalty, rentals, income and special participation taxes.  \n\n \n\nThe next section presents the results achieved when applying the methodology to the Campos \n\nbasin licensing data base for the last 10 years of petroleum acreage lease through a Concession \n\nContract model. \n\n \n\n4.1 Competition under Current Concession Contracts \n\n \n\nDefine a winner offer in a Brazilian E&amp;P acreage auction is not a simple task as it is for the \n\nmost part of Concession Contracts lease sales worldwide. Up to the fourth licensing sale ANP \n\ntransferred the rights and obligations of an area to the oil company which presented the higher \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n \n\n  \n\nbonus value. Furtado (2004) detailed the method applied by ANP, the characteristics of the tenders \n\nand performed statistical analysis to estimate each tender index of success. From the fifth auction \n\nonwards, some adjustments were made to auction rules, where the establishment of a working \n\nprogram, the most relevant biddable factor, consequently reducing the bonus weight in the bidding \n\nprocess (Rodriguez &amp; Suslick, 2009). \n\n \n\nThe success of ANP licensing model and the political stability, fiscal incentives and low risk-\n\ncountry factors lead to the promotion of two auctions for mature oilfields located onshore Brazil, \n\npositively impacting competition among small and national oil companies (Rodriguez et alii, \n\n2008). Along these ten years of acreage licensing, competition varied according to the area \n\npotentials, companies\u00b4 strategies, and the level of information available. Considering competition \n\nand the winner offers for Campos Basin, deep and shallow water areas, Furtado et alii (2008) \n\npresented a methodology to estimate the areas\u00b4 values that helps decision-makers define the \n\nbidding strategies. Focusing the same sedimentary basin, because more than 85% of Brazilian \n\npetroleum production come from oil and gas reservoirs found in both deep and shallow water \n\nareas, Rodriguez &amp; Suslick (2008) made a comparison between Campos Basin areas\u00b4 values and \n\nUS Gulf of Mexico winner offers, for the same period of time. The results achieved showed that oil \n\ncompanies bidding for Outer Continental Shelf areas are assigning a similar an amount of money to \n\nthose spent by oil companies for deep and shallow waters acreage, while adding the total value \n\ncommitted as a minimum exploratory working program (PEM). \n\n \n\nBrazilian E&amp;P acreage auctions have a different way of defining the winner offer, while \n\ncompared to a simple bonus system applied to lease sales worldwide, where the bonus is a fraction \n\nof the expected monetary value (EMV) of the area. The possibility to commit PEM and local \n\ncontent, besides the signature bonus allows companies to make long term investment in the area, \n\ninstead of committing short term cash payment. Local content accounts for 20% of the total offer \n\nweight and was considered irrelevant for the scope of this study. However, bonus and PEM \n\naccount for 40% each and therefore, are a focal point defining the most competitive offer. The \n\nwhole process of ANP licensing E&amp;P areas is presented in Rodriguez &amp; Suslick (2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n \n\n  \n\nDealing with both PEM and signature bonus became essential for companies\u00b4 success, and \n\ncompetition analyses should be precisely performed to help decision-makers develop bidding \n\nstrategies. Envisaging competition evaluation a hypothetical licensing scenario was built and \n\npresented through a questionnaire for experts involved with the Brazilian licensing process. The \n\nresults of this evaluation are discussed in this section and an automated expert system was built \n\nallowing users to perform their own estimation of competition level for the defined scenario. For \n\nBrazilian licensing with different assumptions from ones listed in Annex 1, the expert system could \n\nnot grant reliable results. It should be, therefore, adapted. \n\n \n\nAccording to experts\u2019 judgment collected from the questionnaire some relevant conclusions \n\ncan be reached in two main issues: a) what impacts the participation of a petroleum company in a \n\nparticular tender; and b) how competition can be estimated using experts knowledge. \n\n \n\nTable 3 shows five parameters experts believe could impact the decision making of a company \n\nto participate or not in an auction. They were classified according to their degree of importance and \n\nwill be discussed as a result of the experts\u2019 opinions. Three, out of five parameters, were selected \n\nto build the rules of the expert system: (1) basin and areas on offer; (2) number and profile of the \n\nqualified companies; and (3) information about companies\u2019 strategy (selling and buying petroleum \n\nassets). The expert system was run to yield estimation of the expected level of competition for four \n\nsimulated licensing cases. Finalizing this section, some evidences confirming experts\u2019 findings \n\nabout the variable that has a negative impact on competition \u2013 potential changes on game rules - \n\nwill be presented.    \n\n \n\nDespite the Rodriguez et alii (2006) observation of a positive influence of the licensing \n\nperiod on the Brazilian 7th Licensing Round results when compared with international 2005 \n\ntenders, around 45% experts pointed out the lower relevance of the tender period for competition \n\nevaluation (Table 3). Specialists (55%) reason according to their companies\u2019 strategy, which focus \n\nBrazil for reserve replacement. These companies will bid for acreage independently of tender\u2019s \n\nperiod promoted around the world. On the other hand, 63% of experts mentioned the impact of the \n\nlicensing period on competitor\u2019s participation on Brazilian lease, because they are not completely \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n \n\n  \n\naware of competitor\u2019s strategy. Maybe Brazilian tender was considered to be one among some \n\npotential countries for acreage acquisition for 37% of the experts. \n\n \n\nTABLE  3 - Degree of importance of some information about the Brazilian Petroleum \n\nLicensing \n\nDEGREE OF \n\nIMPORTANCE \n\nBRAZILIAN \n\nLICENSING vs WORLD \n\nLICENSING PERIOD \n\nOIL PROCES \n\nAND R/P \n\nSCENARIOS \n\nBASIN AND \n\nAREAS ON \n\nOFFER \n\nNUMBER AND \n\nPROFILE OF \n\nQUALIFIED \n\nCOMPANIES \n\nCOMPANIES\u2019  \n\nSTRATEGIC \n\nINFORMATION \n\nVERY \n\nIMPORTANT \n20% 34.3% 94.3% 42.9% 20% \n\nIMPORTANT 34.3% 54.3% 5.7% 48.6% 60% \n\nLESS \n\nIMPORTANT \n45.7% 11.4% 0% 8.5% 20% \n\n \n\n \n\nAlmost all experts (88.6%) do believe on world petroleum prices scenarios and reserve over \n\nproduction ratio (R/P) as important criteria for competition level analyses (Table 3).

This is seen as consequence of oil industry needs to enhance R/P using the \n\nprofit from petroleum marketing as bidding budget. Chances of winning more acreage increase \n\nwith higher bids. \n\n \n\nRegarding the areas selected by the government agency to be offered, experts were almost \n\nunanimous identifying this variable as the most important when evaluating competition. Knowing \n\nabout the areas\u2019 location makes the difference for estimating competition. If they belong to a \n\nmature sedimentary basin with a proved active petroleum system or to a new frontier basin, if there \n\nis positive results such as exploration discoveries or fields under production, and if exists flowing \n\nsystem infra-structure, besides the hydrocarbon potential of each block itself, are critical \n\ninformation for all companies. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\n  \n\nANP always set a minimum bonus value per block offered. Previously set as a constant value \n\naccording to the location of the block (onshore, offshore shallow and deep water), since 2003 it \n\nvaries according to the hydrocarbon potential of each block. Generally, blocks located in High \n\nPotential (EP) or in New Frontier areas have the same minimum bonus value per area, except for \n\nthose which ANP\u2019s technical and economic evaluation indicated higher EMV. However, expert\u2019s \n\nopinion can be grouped into two classes: a) those who believe on the credibility of minimum bonus \n\ninformation of block\u2019s geological potential (46%); and b) those that are not confident on ANP \n\ntechnical studies (54%). Figure 7 shows that while requested to estimate competition considering \n\nthe existence of blocks with high minimum bonuses, 52% of experts stated that this information \n\ndoes not impact their competitive analyses if blocks are located in EP areas. Therefore, almost 63% \n\nof the experts considered that information to have a negative impact, reducing the level of \n\ncompetition for the blocks in new frontier areas. These results can be explained by companies\u00b4 risk \n\naversion. When bidding for areas located on EP areas, companies are more confident on their own \n\ngeologic and economic evaluation, and are aware of the petroleum system and production facilities, \n\nwhich may reduce their financial exposure. Contrarily, in new frontier areas where geological \n\nuncertainties and technological challenges should be first solved, companies prefer not to bid for \n\nblocks with high minimum bonuses values to avoid a winner\u2019s curse. \n\n \n\nAccording to experts\u2019 opinion, mapping qualified companies\u2019 strategies and behavior are \n\nvery important variables for competition estimation (see Table 3 for reference). Evaluating the \n\nbidding history of each company can help the identification of potential competitors. This is \n\nreinforced by analyzing companies\u2019 behavior of buying and selling petroleum assets in the basin, in \n\nBrazil or worldwide. For example, one company that has never bided for Campos Basin bought its \n\ngeological and geophysical data or acquired working interest by faming out. This potential non- \n\ncompetitor (SPC) - a company that is familiar with Brazilian licensing, but have never bid for \n\nCampos Basin - has an increasing interest for the basin, according to around 90% of specialists, but \n\nonly little percentage believes SPC will not present an offer (Table 4). On the other hand, if a \n\ncompany is a well known potential competitor (CC), meaning companies that usually bid for the \n\nbasin, although 50% of experts pointed out the increasing interest for the basin, and 40% stated \n\nthat CC participation on the licensing is unpredictable.  \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 7 - Expert\u00b4s judgment on competition impact due to minimum bonus value for both High \n\nPotential and New Frontier Areas \n\n \n\nTABLE 4 \u2013 CC and SPC working interest acquisition that could affect licensing \n\nparticipation \n\nCOMPANY \n\nPROFILE \n\nEXPERTS BELIEVE ON THE \n\nRELEVANCE OF COMPANIES \n\nINFORMATION \n\nINCREASING \n\nINTEREST \n\nWILL NOT \n\nPRESENT OFFER \n\nUNPREDICATBLE \n\nPARTICIPATION \n\nCC > 88% 48.6% 11.4% 40% \n\nSPC 100% \n54.3% (high) \n\n37.1% (medium) \n8.6% ---- \n\n \n\nBesides companies\u00b4 activities on acquiring and selling acreage previous to a bid round, it is \n\nelementary to analyze companies\u00b4 international strategies, financial health and reserve figures. The \n\nquestionnaire asked specialists about three different companies SPC, CC and NE \u2013 a company that \n\nhas never bided in Brazil and is not used to the Brazilian fiscal system (Table 5). Regarding SPC \n\nprofile, 43% of the experts stated they prefer to monitor its behavior and they do not expect SPC as \n\na strong competitor with aggressive offers. However, respondents consider very important mapping \n\nNE, because although not knowing its strategy, they do believe in an unexpected aggressive \n\nbidding or in a strategic alliance with a potential competitor (CC). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n \n\n  \n\nCompanies, despite of being SPC, CC or NE, could bid alone or in consortia according to \n\ntheir bidding strategies. Sunnev\u00e5g (2000) and Saidi &amp; Marsden (1992) analyzed 40 years sales data \n\nbank of Outer Continental Shelf (US-GOM) and revealed that companies associate among \n\nthemselves to share information and investments. So, consortium formation reduces risk of \n\nfinancial loss and aggregates geological knowledge, enhancing the possibility a consortium has to \n\nwin acreage.  \n\n \n\nTABLE 5 \u2013 Degree of importance of qualified companies according to their profile \n\nLEVEL OF IMPORTANCE QUALIFIED \n\nCOMPANIES\u2019 PROFILE VERY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT NO IMPORTANT \n\nCC 83% 17% 0% \n\nNE 46% 48.5% 5.5% \n\nSPC 14% 43% 43% \n\n \n\nWhen argued about this issue, 80% of experts indicated that companies also associate to \n\navoid competition, besides the two above mentioned reasons. In Brazilian petroleum leases the \n\nnumber of players and the number of acreage offered differ by one order of magnitude when \n\ncompared to US-GOM leases (Rodriguez &amp; Suslick, 2008), which is a possible explanation. The \n\nlow availability of acreage leads companies to jointly bid reducing the number of potential \n\ncompetitors, as well as enhancing their possibility to win some area.  \n\n \n\nTrying to understand how companies estimate competition in a situation where competitors \n\nassociate to bid, a set of specific questions were made: \n\n a) Specialists were argued about how they classify information on companies\u2019 strategies for \n\na licensing. According to Figure 8, it is remarkable that information given by decision-makers is \n\nclassified as very important (83%), suggesting that companies rely each other. This is reinforced by \n\n69% experts, who consider \u201cimportant\u201d all information disclosed by companies\u2019 representatives \n\nother than decision makers. If information is obtained from newspaper, specialized magazines, \n\namong others, respondents split their opinion between \u201cless important\u201d (43%) to \u201cnot relevant\u201d \n\n(34%), although 23% still grade as important. The explanation stands on the source of information, \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n \n\n  \n\ni.e., news given by a trustful person or entity should be taken into account, otherwise is rumor, as \n\nwell as those coming from comments raised during the licensing period. \n\nb) Specialists were invited to play a game for estimating competition in a scenario where \n\ninformation was released by newspapers, the acreage is the same for all cases, and are offered \n\naccording to the same rules. Table 6 shows the outcomes for five different cases reflecting experts\u2019 \n\njudgments on competition estimation when companies bid jointly. \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Expert\u2019s evaluation by information source. An information gave by a decision-maker is \n\nvery important when compared with some extracted from a newspaper, for example, which is \n\nconsidered irrelevant by 34% experts. \n\n \n\nTABLE 6 \u2013 Impact of jointly bidding on competition estimation   \n\nCONSORTIA FORMED AMONG POTENTIAL COMPETITORS COMPANIES (CC) \n\nCASE \nCC \n\nEXPERT\u2019S \n\nCOMPANY \n\nNUMBER OF \n\nCONSORTION \n\nTOTAL NUMBER \n\nOF COMPANIES \n\nNUMBER OF \n\nOFFERS \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nESTIMATION \n\nCASE 1 5 1 2 6 4 HIGH = 22 / MD* = 11 \n\nCASE 2 4 1 3 5 2 HIGH = 15 / MD* = 14 \n\nCASE 3 3 1 2 4 2 HIGH = 19 / MD* = 13 \n\nCONSORTION FORMED WITH A NEWCOMER (NE) \n\nCASE 4 3 1 2 4 2 HIGH = 13 / MD* = 20 \n\nCONSORTION FORMED WITH A NON POTENTIAL COMPETITOR COMPANY (SPC) \n\nCASE 5 3 1 2 4 2 HIGH = 7 / MD* = 26 \n\n(*) MD \u2013 a moderate competition \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nCases 1 to 3 are scenarios of high competition and specialist\u2019s company is assumed to \n\nparticipate in all bids. Nevertheless, Case 2 splits expert\u2019s opinion into high and moderate. This \n\ncan be explained by the association of the specialist\u2019s company with another CC, reducing \n\ncompetition as per the experts\u2019 perception. From their point of view, as their company is jointly \n\nbidding with a CC they assess more information and enhance budget, mitigating competition and \n\nbecoming a stronger competitor.  \n\n \n\nCases 4 and 5 deal with situation where newcomers and non-competitors profile, \n\nrespectively, are also players in the bidding game. Both cases present the same conditions such as \n\nnumber of companies, consortia and offers, differing exclusively by the presence of a NE (Case 4) \n\nand SPC (Case 5). Experts consider a consortium formed between a CC and a NE to be a stronger \n\ncompetitor than another formed between CC and SPC. They estimate competition as moderate to \n\nhigh for Case 4 (57%) and 74% of specialists indicate an essentially moderate competition for Case \n\n5, when a SPC associates with any other company. This observation is in accordance to specialists\u00b4 \n\nopinion on SPC relevance as a player in Brazilian licensing, as previously expressed. \n\n \n\nThe game, above described, directly revealed experts\u2019 estimation of competition for a \n\nparticular licensing scenario when there is information regarding consortium formation. \n\n \n\nAnother set of questions retrieved valuable data on experts\u2019 knowledge, later on treated to \n\nbuild the automated computer program able to infer the expected level of competition for a specific \n\npetroleum lease. The Corvid\u00ae Expert System resulting from this research, i.e., considering expert\u2019s \n\njudgment on a variety of issues concerning historical Brazilian licensing, proved to be a powerful \n\ntool for non-specialists interested in analyzing competition in tenders with characteristics similar to \n\nthose mentioned in Annex 1. Software outcomes for four bidding cases are presented in Table 7. \n\n \n\nIn Case 1 user is willing to investigate competition for a lease sale with eight qualified \n\ncompanies competing with the user\u2019s company. Four of them are potential competitors (CC), two \n\nnewcomers (NE) and two companies with non-competitor profile (SPC). User\u2019s company is \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n \n\n  \n\ninterested in bidding for blocks located in high potential sector and close to areas with recent \n\nexploratory successful results (variable EXPSUC_EP = yes). Recently it was announced some \n\nhydrocarbon discoveries in the basin, then the variable DESCBAC was set as \u201cyes\u201d. The results \n\nachieved for CASE 1 revealed a high plus number of competitors, area of very high attractiveness, \n\nrelease of strategic information that stimulates competition, leading to an estimation of a High \n\ncompetition. \n\n \n\nCases 2 and 3 show two different licensing bid simulations, presenting the same estimation \n\nresult - a Moderate level of competition. For Case 2, there were three potential competitors \n\ncompanies (CC) and one newcomer (NE), besides the user\u2019s company, aiming to bid for blocks \n\nclose to the ring fence of oilfields located in high potential areas (RFDP_EP=yes). The third \n\nvariable that lead expert system to estimates a moderate competition was the information about a \n\nrecent discovery in a similar play, but in another basin under evaluation by user\u2019s company \n\n(DESCPLAY=yes). Despite the fact that the release of strategic information stimulates competition \n\n(DESCBAC=yes) in both cases, what differs Case 2 from Case 3 is the number of competitors - \n\nMedium level for Case 2 and Medium Minus for Case 3 (1 SPC, 2 NE and 2 CC), and the \n\nattractiveness of the area, which is High for Case 2 and Median for Case 3, due to the existence of \n\nrecent results of exploratory success in new frontier areas (EXPSUC_NF=yes). \n\n \n\nThe last case, Case 4, presents the bidding conditions for a Low level of competition, which \n\nis reached whenever the area has low attractiveness and the number of competitors is medium \n\nminus. It means, the block user\u2019s company is interested in evaluating competition is located in a \n\nnew frontier area close to ring fences of oilfields (RFDP_NF=yes) and there is no potential \n\ncompetitors (CC) qualified for the licensing round, with only 1 SPC and 3 NE.                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n \n\nThis study revealed positive aspects on a petroleum lease sale that could impact competition, \n\nand the area attractiveness was unanimously pointed out as the most impacting parameter to attract \n\ncompanies\u2019 attention. Nevertheless, there was one question addressed to specialists dedicated to \n\nassess if there was any issue they recognize as of a negative impact on lease tenders. \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n\nTABLE  7 \u2013  Simulated results of expected level of competition using an expert system built from oil industry experts\u00b4 knowledge \nCENARIO_PRECO (*) TIPO_BACIA (**) NUM_COMPETIDORES ATRATIVIDADE_AREA INFO_ESTRATEGICA \n\nOnshore Offshore EP NF \nCASE \n\nSTUDY \n<25 26<$<50 >51 \n\nMature \nNew \n\nFront. \nMature \n\nNew \n\nFront. \n\nSPC NE CC \nEXPSUC_EP RFDP_EP EXPSUC_NF RFDP_NF \n\nLEGISLA DESCBAC DESCPLAY \n\nLEVEL OF \n\nCOMPETITIO\n\nN \n\nESTIMATION \n\n2 2 4 YES NO NO NO NO YES NO \nCASE 1  40    x  \n\nHIGH PLUS VERY HIGH ESTIMULA COMPETI\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nHIGH \n\n0 1 3 NO YES NO NO NO NO YES \nCASE 2  40    x  \n\nMEDIUM HIGH ESTIMULA COMPETI\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nMODERATE \n\n1 2 2 NO NO YES NO NO YES NO \nCASE 3  40    x  \n\nMEDIUM MINUS MEDIAN ESTIMULA COMPETI\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nMODERATE \n\n1 3 0 NO NO NO YES NO NO NO \nCASE 4  40    x  \n\nMEDIUM MINUS LOW N\u00c3O AFETA PERCEP\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nLOW \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n119 \n \n\n \n\nTable 8 shows that, despite the attractiveness of the acreage on sale potential changes on \n\ngame rules are enough to create a risky environment for exploration investment. What experts do \n\nremark as strongly impacting the participation of any oil company, more than the possible \n\npresence of potential competitors or newcomers, is the Brazilian fiscal and legal environment for \n\nperforming E&amp;P activities. Any changes made by the Government on the fiscal system, the \n\nregulatory framework, or to the licensing rules, could immediately cause a retraction on \n\ncompanies\u2019 intention to participate.  \n\n \n\nTABLE 8 \u2013 Impact on companies\u00b4 participation in a licensing when the regulatory \n\nframework is subject to changes \n\nCOMPANY PROFILE \nEXPERTS TRUST ON THE \n\nIMPACT ON COMPETITION \n\nHIGH POTENTIAL AREA \n\n(EP) \n\nNEW FRONTIER AREA \n\n(NF) \n\nCOMPETITOR (CC) > 91% > 88% > 85% \n\nNEWCOMER (NE) > 94% > 86% > 86% \n\n \n\nThe Brazilian petroleum lease history data presents unusual results regarding companies \n\nbidding for acreage on the 5th Licensing Round that could be assumed as an example of that \n\nexpert perception. Rodriguez &amp; Suslick (2009) pointed out that only three oil companies, \n\namongst the eighties used to participate in Brazilian auctions, made offers in that licensing round \n\ncharacterizing a low competitive bid. These authors correlated this with: a) the changes on the \n\nfiscal system (Noel and Valentin Laws), and b) the new licensing model approved by ANP, which \n\nintroduced new criteria to define the winner offer, and changed some technical concepts (PEM as \n\nbiddable factor, area size, relinquishment policies, exploration phase duration, among others). \n\n \n\nAlthough these changes have negatively impacted competition on the 5th Licensing Round, \n\nthe oil industry reacted positively, returning to the game in the following leases. This behavior \n\ncan be assigned to the success of the petroleum exploration activities observed then. Some \n\nconstrains established for the 8th licensing round, so as the number of area acquired by the same \n\noperator, caused its suspension sine die. Just before starting the 9th Bid Round, ANP withdrew \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n120 \n \n\nfrom the auction portfolio areas with subsalt potentials after Tupi wildcatd results (Berman, \n\n2008). These unstable procedures promoted a revision on the current auction model. \n\nThe Petroleum Law 9478/97, in force for over 10 years, proved that auctioning acreage through \n\nConcession Contract agreements is a model that stimulated high risk investments in a period \n\nwhen oil prices raised from US$12,00/bbl to US$130,00/bbl. This investment in petroleum \n\nexploration lead to oil and gas field discoveries, such as Tupi - a super-giant oilfield - located in \n\ndeep water Santos Basin, with pre-salt reserves estimated from 5 to 8 Billion boe (Berman, 2008). \n\n \n\nRecently, in the same geologic play and region, a series of similar potential oilfields were \n\ndiscovered, leading Brazilian proved reserves from 14.2 Billion boe to a total reserve estimated \n\nfrom 70 to 100 Billion boe. These discoveries opened a new oil frontier, motivating the Federal \n\nGovernment to review the petroleum regulatory policy to protect Brazilian oil and gas reserves. \n\nThe proposal considers changing from Concession Contracts licensing to a Production Sharing \n\nContracts, for all acreage to be licensed in areas where the pre-salt horizons occur. \n\n \n\n4.2. Competition Expectation under Production Sharing Contracts \n\nProduction Sharing Contracts (PSC) is a petroleum exploration licensing system conceived by \n\nthe oil industry to have the rights and obligations to explore attractive acreage in high risk \n\ncountries, such as those located in Asia and Africa. Based on sharing all oil and gas produced \n\nfrom an area, it is a competitive licensing process as the Concession Contract.  \n\n \n\nAlmost all petroleum contracts in effect worldwide provide for Government Take to be a mix \n\nof financial revenues and production entitlement. As shown in Figure 9, countries adopt different \n\ncontract models the most commom being PSC and Concession Contracts. Europe and particularly \n\nUSA have more open systems for the E&amp;P activity. Middle East is the most protectionist region. \n\nOne of the most common legal arrangements between a Government (or its National Oil \n\nCompany - NOC) and a private company is the PSC. The main difference between Concessions \n\nand PSC Contracts is that under the former the Company is entitled to the hydrocarbons before or \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n121 \n \n\nupon them being produced (Johnston, 1994). Table 9 presents more details on both models of \n\ncontracts.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Map with the countries that promote licensing of exploration acreage applying \n\nConcession Contract and Production Sharing Contract models. \n\n \n\nAlthough Brazil has been successful in differentiating itself from its Latin America \n\nneighbors, a new regime is to be introduced through amendments to the existing Petroleum law \n\n(Law 9478/97), the creation of a National Oil Company (Pr\u00e9 Sal Petr\u00f3leo S.A. - PPSA), and a \n\nSocial Fund at a Federal level. This new legal framework should be applied exclusively to the \n\npre-salt areas, being the remaining onshore and the offshore shallow or deepwater areas subject to \n\nthe current regime. \n\nAs this new licensing model is still under discussion and the associated regulatory policy is \n\nessentially different from that applied for the well known Concession Contract rules, listening to \n\nthe oil industry experts about their perceptions on the expected level of competition for the new \n\nlicensing model was very opportune. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n122 \n \n\nTable 9 \u2013 Main differences between Concession Contracts and Production Sharing \n\nContracts \n\n Concession / License Contracts Production Sharing Contracts \n\nParties Grantor = Sovereign or Government \n\nAgency \n\nGrantee = Investors and possible \n\nParticipating Local Companies \n\nPrincipal = NOC or Government Agency \n\nContractor = Investors and possible NOC \n\nand/or Participating Local Companies \n\nFiscal System Royalty / Tax Cost Recovery / Profit Share \n\nGovernment Take Signature and production bonuses \n\nRoyalties (5% to 10%) \n\nProperty taxes on assets owned \n\nIncome taxes on profits from operations \n\nSpecial participation tax varying from 10% \n\nto 40% according to volumes and water \n\ndepth of the field, among others \n\nSignature and production bonuses \n\nGovernment share of production \n\nIncome taxes on Grantee\u2019 s profit from sale \n\nAsset Ownership Grantee owns the assets and has the duty \n\nto abandon and decommission \n\nNOC owns the assets from cost recovery \n\nContractor has the right to use the asset until \n\ntermination \n\nProduction \n\nOwnership \n\nGrantee owns production at wellhead  Contractor is entitled to a share of \n\nproduction \n\nManagement and \n\nControl \n\nGrantee manages and controls operations \n\nsubject to regulations \n\nGrantor manages and controls according to \n\nregulations and approved work program \n\n \n\nAll 36 experts were unanimous in referring to PSC as a familiar contract model that could \n\nbe applied for pre-salt areas with no major effect on the contractors\u2019 side. They recognized that \n\nthis licensing program, theoretically, is as competitive as the concession contracts in force. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n123 \n \n\nAmong the interviewees, some reported that majors and super majors are used to explore in \n\ncountries with PSC licensing agreements, and are familiar to Brazilian political and economic \n\nculture - once they are concessionaires of E&amp;P Brazilian assets \u2013 will comfortably deal with the \n\nregulatory changes, and consequently, continue to compete for the pre-salt acreage. On the other \n\nhand, independents and regional companies should bid in a more conservative way or make a \n\ntight sensitivity risk analysis indicating not to present an offer in the bid process. \n\n \n\nThe last question of the questionnaire was created to cover this subject. Although a \n\nmultiple-choice question, with two \"yes\" and two \"no\" options, participants were encouraged to \n\ngive their opinion regarding what is expected in terms of competition after changing the licensing \n\npolicy. \n\n \n\nThe statistics obtained during this enquire is shown in Figure 10. Sixty-four percent of \n\nexperts (64%) believe that this change will reduce the level of competition, but 20% do not see \n\nany impact. Both 8% figures reflect a percentage of experts that prefer not to respond the question \n\nand those which state that there are some aspects of the policy that could motivate companies to \n\ncompete and others that could promote the opposite effect. It means that most part (64%) believes \n\nin a negative impact reducing the level of competition, but 20% do not see any impact. A small \n\ngroup of experts (8%) states that the policy could motivate companies to compete or to decline \n\noffer. The remaining eight percent (8%) represents experts that prefer not to respond the question. \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Result of expert\u00b4s opinion about the possible impact on competition with the possible \n\nchange on the current licensing policy.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n124 \n \n\n \n\nRegarding the \u201cno\u201d responses (20%), all experts but one, indicate the high potential of pre-\n\nsalt areas as the main factor to keep competition at similar levels of such observed in previous \n\nconcession contracts bids. One expert believes in the maintenance of competition level because \n\nthese changes do not significantly affect companies\u00b4 interest even when loosing rights to oil \n\nproperty and having a maximum working interest limited to 70%.  \n\n \n\nIn respect of the \u201cyes\u201d answers, which account for 64%, most of the respondents expect a \n\nchange on the level of competition with the approval of the amendments on the Petroleum Law \n\ncurrently in force, implementing the PSC as the licensing model for the pre-salt areas. \n\nNevertheless, among these experts it is possible to group participants with different opinions.  \n\n \n\nWithin 64%, only 10% of the experts believe on the reduction on competition due to \n\nrestriction for hydrocarbon production entitlement to companies. Despite the majority not expects \n\nlack of transparency in the conduction of PSC licensing agreement among Brazilian Government \n\nand petroleum companies, twenty percent (20%) of the \u201cyes\u201d population related this negative \n\naspect with a possible impact on competition level. Their opinion are supported by Cramtom \n\n(2005) who reported that PSCs are often associated to lack of transparency, because the \n\nnegotiations between the Principal and each Contractor or Consortium while selling E&amp;P assets \n\nare developed in different occasions. However, what reinforces the majority of participants not \n\nexpecting any kind of collusion and/or corruption in the process of selling areas within the new \n\nlegal framework is ANP\u00b4s ability in sale E&amp;P acreage for the past 10 years under clear rules \n\npreviously established, and Brazilian stable fiscal system. \n\n \n\nThe large majority (70%) of oil industry representatives interviewed agreed that a change \n\nfrom a Concession Contract model to a Production Sharing is definitely not the issue when \n\nanalyzing competition. What really could impact the level of expected competition are the rules \n\nadopted for the PSC structure. They are mainly concerned with two aspects of the new regulatory \n\npolicy: 1) the power delegated to PPSA, the company proposed to be the NOC in the PSC model, \n\nand 2) the designation of Petrobras, a Brazilian state company which had the monopoly to \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n125 \n \n\nperform E&amp;P activities in Brazil for around 45 years, as the sole operator for all acreage to be \n\nlicensed under the PSC rules. \n\n \n\nAmong the four amendments seeking for congress approval, the creation of a NOC \u2013 PPSA, \n\nwhich has privileges on the voting procedure for both technical and operational decisions, is \n\npointed out as the detrimental aspect of the process. Moreover, another key issue raised by \n\nexperts is the establishment of Petrobras as the unique operator of all pre-salt areas to be licensed. \n\nA quick wrap-up of the judgment of the 33 experts giving opinion on such subject (Figure 11), \n\nlead to the conclusion that Brazilian Government intention to change the licensing model, \n\nenvisaging strategic protection of the pre-salt high oil volumes zone, is acceptable by 77% of all \n\nupstream companies currently searching for oil and gas offshore Brazil.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Graphic showing total 33 \"yes\" and \"no\" answers on policy changes on the current \n\nlicensing model. \"No\" answers (23%) are related to the high potential pre-salt areas and to the \n\nworking interest limited to 70%, as proposed by PSC rules. The \"yes\" answers (77%) as per \n\nexpert\u2019s opinion are associated with hydrocarbon entitlement and lack of transparency, and \n\nmainly with the voting procedure and unique operatorship. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n126 \n \n\n \n\nHowever, the establishment of rules that could prevent them to fully operate E&amp;P assets \n\nand voting against or in accordance with the consortium decisions, without the interference of a \n\npurely administrative company, as PPSA is supposed to be, could significantly impact the \n\ncompetition level, as perceived by experts. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\n \n\nAnalyzing competition in a petroleum lease sale is not an easy task, and this is the reason \n\nwhy the literature to generally consider its existence as an assumption for mathematical models \n\ndeveloped to define optimal bids, such that maximize revenues in a simple bonus bidding system. \n\nHowever, Brazilian licensing model is more complex and besides bonus, deal with both working \n\nprogram and local content as biddable factors. So, defining the optimal bid becomes more \n\ncomplicated, pushing companies to do a better job while evaluating competition, and helping \n\ndecision-makers find suitable bidding strategies.  \n\n \n\nThis study targets to understand how oil companies\u2019 representatives, used to participate in \n\nBrazilian lease, perceive competition, and also build a practical tool that could estimate the \n\nexpected level of competition in a Brazilian tender. \n\n   \n\nThe first objective was reached by the development of a questionnaire applied to 36 \n\nspecialists from 20 oil companies and governmental entities to investigate specialists\u2019 opinion \n\nabout competition. Questions were formulated using a database built based on ANP results in the \n\nlast eight licensing rounds in which Campos Basin acreage was offered. This method proved to be \n\neffective in assessing experts judgment on the main licensing variables that directly impact the \n\ndecision making process. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that limitations on \n\nintelligence and perception constrain the ability of decision-makers to accurately calculate the \n\noptimal choice from the available information (Bazerman, 2006). The main conclusions of the \n\ncurrent research project are the following: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n127 \n \n\n\u2022 The questionnaire successfully captured experts knowledge and is robust enough to allow a \n\ncomprehensive understanding in how specialists mind deal with technical data, strategic \n\ninformation and licensing rules to estimate competition; \n\n\u2022 There is no bias observed on the questionnaires answers neither per specialists business \n\nposition nor for their companies profile. This can be correlated to past professionals \n\nexperience of the interviewed team; \n\n\u2022 According to 94% of the assessed experts, what grants the success of a petroleum lease sale is \n\nthe quality of the auctioned asset. High potential areas attract competitors interest.  Since the \n\n80\u2019s Brazil is discovering giant to super-giant oilfields, attracting oil industry attention to \n\nBrazilian hydrocarbon potential acreage (Moraes Jr et al., 2004). This is confirmed by the \n\nhigh levels of competition for assets located at Campos Basin as shown by Furtado et al. \n\n(2008), exception made for the 5th Licensing Round;  \n\n\u2022 What do really cause a negative impact reducing competition are uncertainties, not those \n\nrelated to acreage, but to the policies, as happened during the year of the 5th tender. An \n\nunstable fiscal system or a licensing process conducted without transparency is unanimously \n\nidentified by industry representatives as key  that reduce the success of a bid round; \n\n\u2022 Almost all interviewees indicated high level of competition for acreage located in high \n\npotential areas or even in new frontiers, since they are prospectively sit on a sedimentary \n\nbasin with active petroleum system, and have production flowing systems available close by;  \n\n\u2022 More than 90% of respondents, the proper evaluation on qualified companies characteristics \n\n(strategies, budgets, exploration portfolio, etc), which is crucial for a calibrated competition \n\nestimation. Experts stated they should be aware of potential competitors (CC) movement, i.e., \n\ncompanies that usually bid in Brazil for mature basins where they already perform E&amp;P \n\nactivities and are qualified for the round. Companies that have never bided in the country, i.e. \n\nnewcomers (NE), meaning not being familiar with ANP and Brazilian policies, prefer to \n\nassociate with CC to avoid losing the bid if they make offers alone and based only in the \n\nsymmetric information they acquired from ANP database. On the other hand, companies used \n\nto bid in Brazilian tenders, but acquired data for a mature basin where they never bid before \n\n(SPC), do not demand experts attention. They do not expect SPCs competing against CCs, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n128 \n \n\nwhich has asymmetric information, but farming into opportunities in the basin, other than \n\neffectively participating in the licensing. \n\n \n\nThe second goal was accomplished by the development of an automated expert system, using \n\nCorvid\u00ae platform, which works with a knowledge database build from experts\u2019 judgment on \n\ncompetition issues that were transformed into rules. It proved to be an efficient tool, as per the \n\nfindings obtained for the four theoretical cases implemented on the software. The expert system \n\nwas able to properly estimate the level of competition level expected for each case, showing \n\ncoherent outcomes when run by non-specialists. Users must be aware that this expert system was \n\ndeveloped for Brazilian lease of Campos Basin acreage in a period of time when average oil price \n\nwas US$40,00/bbl. Results may vary according to the assumptions adopted. \n\n \n\nThe last conclusion refers to a current discussion about the newly proposed regulatory \n\nlicensing policy. As shown by this study, competition granted the success of licensing promoted \n\nby ANP under the Concession Contract model. For licensing acreage under Production Sharing \n\nContract model, specialists (64%) expect an impact in competition level due to the rules adopted \n\nby the government and not because of the model. PSC is a well known model applied in many \n\ncountries worldwide, which facilitates the bid for companies familiar with its rules. In Brazil, \n\nexperts pointed out two main reasons for reducing competition: a) the decision to have \n\nPETROBRAS as the unique operator for all acreage licensed, and b) the voting procedures for the \n\nNOC (Pr\u00e9-Sal) who can reject both technical and economic issues. If the regulatory changes are \n\napproved as is, then competition level may be affected. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nSpecial thanks for PETROBRAS - E&amp;P Corporate Managers for sponsoring this research; \n\nfor Colorado School of Mines Business and Economic Department staff members for profitable \n\ndiscussions and Unicamp/Cepetro for furnishing all support needed, and to Saul Suslick (in \n\nmemoriam) who has encouraged my ideas driving them to a concrete contribution. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n129 \n \n\n \n\n References \n\n \n\nANP, 2010.

The next step consisted in giving notes for each variable value, as \n\nseen on Table 11.

CONCLUS\u00d5ES E RECOMENDA\u00c7\u00d5ES \n\nDentre os fatores que atestam o sucesso das licita\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1reas para explora\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n(E&amp;P) de petr\u00f3leo no Brasil destacam-se a qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o de um n\u00famero elevado de companhias, \n\nque implica em competi\u00e7\u00e3o pelas \u00e1reas, e a qualidade do portf\u00f3lio explorat\u00f3rio ofertado que, com \n\nsuas conseq\u00fcentes descobertas de hidrocarbonetos, atrai o interesse dessas companhias. Aliados a \n\nesses fatores, o baixo risco-pa\u00eds, a exist\u00eancia de um regime fiscal est\u00e1vel e a clareza nas regras \n\ndas licita\u00e7\u00f5es promovidas pela ANP, propiciaram um ambiente mais seguro para os investimentos \n\ndas empresas de petr\u00f3leo de pequeno, m\u00e9dio e grande porte, gerando benef\u00edcios ao Pa\u00eds, tais \n\ncomo o desenvolvimento de setores da ind\u00fastria do petr\u00f3leo e o recolhimento de participa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ngovernamentais, dentre outros tributos. \n\nO modelo de licita\u00e7\u00e3o competitivo selado adotado pela ANP \u00e9 considerado eficiente e \n\ndifere da maioria das licita\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais por prover ao governo: a) receitas \u201cupfront\u201d \n\ndecorrentes do pagamento de b\u00f4nus para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1rea; b) informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas geol\u00f3gicas das \u00e1reas e seu potencial petrol\u00edfero, resultante das atividades \n\nexplorat\u00f3rias, e comprometidas pelas companhias, como o Programa Explorat\u00f3rio M\u00ednimo \n\n(PEM); e c) o desenvolvimento da ind\u00fastria nacional a partir da oferta de um percentual de \n\ncontrata\u00e7\u00e3o de bens e servi\u00e7os dom\u00e9sticos para a execu\u00e7\u00e3o das atividades de E&amp;P.  \n\nEm todas as dez licita\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1reas explorat\u00f3rias e nas duas licita\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1reas inativas com \n\nacumula\u00e7\u00f5es marginais observam-se movimentos de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o, com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de parcerias \n\npara dividir os riscos t\u00e9cnicos e financeiros, reduzindo, assim, o n\u00famero de competidores \u2013 e \n\nmovimentos de competi\u00e7\u00e3o entre as firmas - onde a companhia detentora de informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nassim\u00e9trica possui uma vantagem competitiva em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s demais na disputa pela aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa \u00e1rea.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n150 \n \n\nHistoricamente, analisando as ofertas para as \u00e1reas da Bacia de Campos, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel observar \n\nos comportamentos de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o e competi\u00e7\u00e3o entre as companhias. Nas \u00e1reas de maior \n\npotencial geol\u00f3gico e nas chamadas de \u201cgolden blocks\u201d, as companhias tendem a realizar ofertas \n\nassociadas entre si e a oferecer valores pr\u00f3ximos a um (1,0), que s\u00e3o muito maiores que as \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es do valor monet\u00e1rio esperado (VME) que a literatura recomenda como oferta \u00f3tima (0,3) \n\npara enfrentar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Para essas \u00e1reas, quantificar o \u201cdinheiro deixado sobre a mesa\u201d ou \n\nconsiderar a poss\u00edvel \u201cmaldi\u00e7\u00e3o do vencedor\u201d s\u00e3o dados sem valor para as pr\u00f3prias empresas e \n\npara a ANP, sendo apenas uma informa\u00e7\u00e3o que revela o grau de avers\u00e3o ao risco das empresas: \n\nalto risco x alto pr\u00eamio x alto investimento. Entretanto, para ofertas realizadas para as \u00e1reas de \n\npotencial geol\u00f3gico m\u00e9dio e baixo, o modelo de simula\u00e7\u00e3o estoc\u00e1stico constru\u00eddo mostrou ser \n\numa ferramenta robusta para auxiliar os decisores na defini\u00e7\u00e3o do b\u00f4nus \u00f3timo. A estimativa do \n\nvalor de VME/km2 permite as firmas elaborarem ofertas competitivas para o bloco de seu \n\ninteresse, em um cen\u00e1rio de alta volatilidade de pre\u00e7os de petr\u00f3leo e incertezas nos determinantes \n\ndo mercado. De acordo com a simetria entre os valores de VME/km2 efetivamente realizados e os \n\nestocasticamente simulados pode-se concluir que quanto maior o n\u00famero de competidores, \n\nmaiores os valores de VME/km2 ofertados pelas companhias, em situa\u00e7\u00f5es em que h\u00e1 simetria de \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es. Quando h\u00e1 assimetria, apesar de n\u00e3o ter sido objeto desta pesquisa, observou-se que \n\nas companhias menos informadas, em geral, realizam poucas ofertas, por\u00e9m s\u00e3o mais agressivas \n\nnos valores apresentados. Esta metodologia pode revelar a expectativa explorat\u00f3ria das \n\ncompanhias, como verificado nas licita\u00e7\u00f5es da Bacia de Campos, tornando vis\u00edvel seu \n\ncomportamento em termos de estrat\u00e9gias de oferta, aloca\u00e7\u00e3o financeira de recursos e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncons\u00f3rcios com suas prefer\u00eancias. O modelo estoc\u00e1stico proposto pode ser aplicado para \u00e1reas em \n\noutras bacias, mesmo que localizadas fora do Brasil, desde que licitadas sob um modelo \n\ncompetitivo selado. \n\nObservando-se que os valores pagos pelas firmas para as \u00e1reas da Bacia de Campos eram, \n\npor vezes, elevados, efetuou-se uma an\u00e1lise comparativa entre estas ofertas e as realizadas pelas \n\nempresas para \u00e1reas do Golfo do M\u00e9xico Americano (US-GOM), com o intuito de quantificar o \n\ninteresse das empresas no Brasil. As licita\u00e7\u00f5es escolhidas para an\u00e1lise, realizadas em 2004 e \n\n2005, consideraram a exist\u00eancia de um mesmo cen\u00e1rio de pre\u00e7os de petr\u00f3leo e potencial \n\ngeol\u00f3gico das \u00e1reas. Mesmo o US-GOM, atraindo o interesse de um n\u00famero de companhias de \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n151 \n \n\ntr\u00eas a quatro vezes maior que no Brasil, e tendo um n\u00famero de \u00e1reas ofertadas entre 200 e 400% \n\nmaior que o montante de \u00e1reas ofertadas no Brasil, identificou-se que as empresas oferecem o \n\ndobro do valor por unidade de \u00e1rea para as \u00e1reas de \u00e1guas profundas brasileiras. Em 2004, as \n\nempresas pagaram US$55.000,00/km2 para as \u00e1reas localizadas em l\u00e2mina d\u00b4\u00e1gua superior a \n\n400m de profundidade e US$25.000,00/km2 em \u00e1reas semelhantes do US-GOM. Em 2005 estes \n\nvalores foram US$160.000,00/km2 contra US$80.000,00/km2, respectivamente. Ressalta-se que, \n\npara as \u00e1reas do US-GOM os valores s\u00e3o obtidos dividindo o b\u00f4nus de assinatura pelo total de \n\n\u00e1rea arrematada com esses b\u00f4nus. Para as ofertas brasileiras esses n\u00fameros foram calculados \n\nadicionando ao b\u00f4nus, o montante comprometido como PEM, ap\u00f3s converter as unidades de \n\ntrabalho (UT) em valores monet\u00e1rios. Tais n\u00fameros confirmam a atratividade da Bacia de \n\nCampos, e do Brasil, no cen\u00e1rio mundial de oportunidades explorat\u00f3rias, atraindo assim, os \n\ninvestimentos da ind\u00fastria do petr\u00f3leo. \n\nEntretanto, para as companhias realizarem esses investimentos e adquirirem as \u00e1reas que \n\natendem ao seu portf\u00f3lio explorat\u00f3rio, ou seja, aquelas que podem maximizar suas receitas, al\u00e9m \n\nda valora\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnica e econ\u00f4mica da \u00e1rea, se faz necess\u00e1ria uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o rigorosa do n\u00edvel de \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o esperado. \n\nPara estimar o n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o, construiu-se um sistema especialista cujo insumo foi \n\num question\u00e1rio desenvolvido para capturar o conhecimento de 36 especialistas que atuam como \n\nt\u00e9cnicos, gerentes, consultores, diretores e presidentes em 20 companhias de petr\u00f3leo de pequeno, \n\nm\u00e9dio e grande porte. Tal question\u00e1rio propiciou ainda, conhecer como as companhias lidam com \n\nas informa\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas, regulat\u00f3rias e estrat\u00e9gicas para estimar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de permitir a \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das vari\u00e1veis que impactam a competi\u00e7\u00e3o nos modelos licitat\u00f3rios de concess\u00e3o e \n\nde partilha de produ\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPara 94% dos entrevistados o que mais estimula a competi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a qualidade das \u00e1reas \n\noferecidas pela ANP, ou seja, a oferta de \u00e1reas de elevado potencial geol\u00f3gico localizadas em \n\nbacias sedimentares com sistema petrol\u00edfero ativo e dispondo de infraestrutura para escoamento \n\nda produ\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s natural sugere elevada competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Por unanimidade, o que \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n152 \n \n\nnegativamente impacta a competi\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o incertezas do tipo regime fiscal inst\u00e1vel e/ou falta de \n\ntranspar\u00eancia nas regras da licita\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n O perfil estrat\u00e9gico, financeiro e explorat\u00f3rio das companhias qualificadas nas licita\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nbem como seu hist\u00f3rico de atua\u00e7\u00e3o no Brasil (compra e venda de ativos de E&amp;P) foi identificado \n\npor 90% dos especialistas como sendo a segunda mais importante vari\u00e1vel de impacto na \n\nestimativa de competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao se analisar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o para as \u00e1reas de elevado potencial e de \n\nnovas fronteiras da Bacia de Campos, 83% dos especialistas indicaram como potenciais \n\ncompetidoras (CC) as companhias qualificadas atuantes no pa\u00eds e que j\u00e1 possuem exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nexplorat\u00f3ria na bacia. Entretanto, companhias qualificadas que atuam no Brasil, mas que nunca \n\napresentaram oferta para esta bacia, foram consideradas por 46% dos especialistas como sem \n\nperfil de competidoras (SPC) por disporem apenas de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sim\u00e9tricas, ou seja, aquelas \n\nque qualquer empresa pode adquirir do banco de dados da ANP. Segundo 14% dos especialistas, \n\nas companhias conhecidas como novas entrantes (NE), i.e., aquelas que nunca participaram de \n\numa licita\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira, preferem competir em associa\u00e7\u00e3o com as CC para terem acesso a \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es privilegiadas (assim\u00e9tricas) sobre a bacia, que lhes garanta uma vantagem \n\ncompetitiva. \n\nEssas percep\u00e7\u00f5es, adquiridas atrav\u00e9s do question\u00e1rio, foram transformados em regras para a \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um sistema especialista, utilizando a plataforma Exsys Corvid\u00ae, capaz de estimar \n\no n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o para \u00e1reas da Bacia de Campos em um cen\u00e1rio de pre\u00e7o de petr\u00f3leo pr\u00e9-\n\nestabelecido a US$40,00/bbl. \n\nA simula\u00e7\u00e3o de quatro casos te\u00f3ricos em que se variou: 1) o tipo de \u00e1rea em oferta, 2) o \n\nn\u00famero e o tipo de companhias qualificadas, 3) a exist\u00eancia ou n\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre campos \n\nem produ\u00e7\u00e3o, descobertas de petr\u00f3leo na bacia ou em plays an\u00e1logos, e 4) a estabilidade do \n\nsistema fiscal e regulat\u00f3rio, mostrou resultados coerentes. Al\u00e9m da estimativa robusta do n\u00edvel de \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o, outra vantagem da ferramenta desenvolvida \u00e9 sua interatividade que permite a \n\nqualquer usu\u00e1rio n\u00e3o especialista nas licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras, atrav\u00e9s de respostas a perguntas pr\u00e9-\n\nestabelecidas, conhecer o n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o para a \u00e1rea que deseja avaliar. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n153 \n \n\nPor fim, questionados sobre o impacto da nova regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o do setor petr\u00f3leo na \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o pelas \u00e1reas do pr\u00e9-sal, 64% dos especialistas acreditam em uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o pelo modelo de Partilha de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o adotado, pois este \u00e9 mundialmente \n\nreconhecido como v\u00e1lido, apesar de ser considerado pouco transparente, mas sim pelas regras \n\nestipuladas que conferem \u00e0 Petrobras a opera\u00e7\u00e3o exclusiva das \u00e1reas licitadas, e o poder de veto \u00e0 \n\ncompanhia estatal - Pr\u00e9 Sal Petr\u00f3leo S.A..  \n\nComo recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es para trabalhos futuros sugere-se: a) desenvolver novos question\u00e1rios \n\nque possam capturar o julgamento dos especialistas em licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao \n\ncen\u00e1rio de pre\u00e7o de petr\u00f3leo vari\u00e1vel e a competi\u00e7\u00e3o em bacias terrestres, por exemplo; b) \n\nincorporar as consequentes respostas desses novos question\u00e1rios ao sistema especialista existente,  \n\nampliando seu escopo, de forma a estimar o n\u00edvel de competi\u00e7\u00e3o em outras bacias brasileiras, ou \n\noutras licita\u00e7\u00f5es mundiais, ou sob quaisquer modelos regulat\u00f3rios onde exista a competi\u00e7\u00e3o; e c) \n\ndesenvolver modelos com base na teoria dos jogos visando definir estrat\u00e9gias de oferta mais \n\ncompetitivas que usam b\u00f4nus e PEM, para as licita\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras considerando as metodologias \n\naqui desenvolvidas de valora\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea e de estimativa de competi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n155 \n \n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS \n\nAG\u00caNCIA NACIONAL DO PETR\u00d3LEO, G\u00c1S NATURAL E BIOCOMBUST\u00cdVEIS (ANP). \nRodada das Licita\u00e7\u00f5es.
