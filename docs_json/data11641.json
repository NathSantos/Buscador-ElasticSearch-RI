And I can prevent it from going bankrupt. Being happy is to \n\nrecognize that life is worth living, despite all the challenges, misunderstandings and periods of \n\ncrisis. Being happy is to stop being a victim of the problems and become an author of history \n\nitself. It is to cross deserts outside ourselves, but being able to find an oasis deep in our soul. \n\nIt is to thank God every morning for the miracle of life. Being happy is to be unafraid of our \n\nown feelings. It is to talk about ourselves. Is to have the courage to hear a \u2018no\u2019. Is to be strong \n\nenough to listen to a criticism, even if unfair... Stones on the path?

M\u00e9todos: Para o primeiro estudo, a amostra incluiu \n\n89 coordenadores pedag\u00f3gicos de escolas de nata\u00e7\u00e3o e 100 professores de nata\u00e7\u00e3o. Em ambos \n\nos grupos amostrais foram aplicados question\u00e1rios para apurar a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e metodologia de \n\nensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o. Para o segundo estudo, a amostra foi constitu\u00edda por 21 crian\u00e7as (4,70 \u00b1 \n\n0,51 anos), de ambos os g\u00e9neros e sem qualquer experi\u00eancia em programas de ensino da \n\nnata\u00e7\u00e3o. A amostra foi dividida em dois grupos experimentais, que foram sujeitos a um \n\nprograma similar de ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, durante seis meses, mas vari\u00e1vel na profundidade do \n\nespa\u00e7o aqu\u00e1tico (piscina de \u00e1gua rasa; piscina de \u00e1gua profunda). Para o terceiro estudo, a \n\namostra foi composta por 33 crian\u00e7as (4,8 \u00b1 0,5 anos). A amostra foi dividida em tr\u00eas grupos: \n\ngrupo de controlo; grupo praticante de futebol; grupo praticante de nata\u00e7\u00e3o. Foi utilizado o \n\nTest Gross Motor Development - 2nd Edition para avaliar o desenvolvimento motor global em \n\ntr\u00eas momentos distintos: ap\u00f3s cinco, dez e trinta meses de pr\u00e1tica desportiva. Resultados: Os \n\nresultados do primeiro estudo sugerem que a nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico rege-\n\nse, sobretudo, pelas orienta\u00e7\u00f5es do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o. Os principais objetivos das aulas \n\nest\u00e3o relacionados com a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o ao meio aqu\u00e1tico, privilegiando-se as habilidades aqu\u00e1ticas \n\nb\u00e1sicas (81,4%), num ensino pouco suportado em material pedag\u00f3gico. No segundo estudo, os \n\nresultados sugerem que o ensino em piscina rasa permite adquirir um n\u00edvel superior de \n\ncompet\u00eancia aqu\u00e1tica, em particular em cinco habilidades aqu\u00e1ticas b\u00e1sicas. No terceiro \n\nestudo, os dados apontam, em ambos os grupos (futebol e nata\u00e7\u00e3o), para uma melhoria \n\nsignificativa do quociente motor bruto e dos scores padr\u00e3o, na locomo\u00e7\u00e3o e controlo de objetos \n\nentre T5 e T10. Os praticantes de futebol atingem um quociente m\u00e1ximo de desenvolvimento \n\nmotor ap\u00f3s 10 meses de pr\u00e1tica. Os praticantes de nata\u00e7\u00e3o apresentaram um desenvolvimento \n\nmotor (entre T10 e T30) gradual, particularmente em habilidades de controlo de objetos. \n\nConclus\u00f5es: Os dados descritos no primeiro estudo permitiram-nos identificar algumas \n\ninsufici\u00eancias no enquadramento da nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico, provavelmente \n\npor condicionantes da efici\u00eancia do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, ao n\u00edvel da aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nhabilidades aqu\u00e1ticas mais complexas. Para al\u00e9m disso, os resultados sugerem que as sess\u00f5es \n\nde nata\u00e7\u00e3o em baixa profundidade parecem facilitar o desenvolvimento da compet\u00eancia \n\naqu\u00e1tica em crian\u00e7as, ap\u00f3s seis meses de pr\u00e1tica. Foi tamb\u00e9m conclu\u00eddo que a pr\u00e1tica \n\ndesportiva (nata\u00e7\u00e3o e futebol) durante a inf\u00e2ncia pode contribuir para um maior \n\ndesenvolvimento motor.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nix \n\nResumo Alargado \n\nObjetivos: Esta tese encontra-se dividida em tr\u00eas prop\u00f3sitos principais, consubstanciados em \n\ntr\u00eas estudos relacionados com o ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o: (i) descrever a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e metodologia \n\nde ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o desenvolvida em Portugal, no \u00e2mbito da disciplina de Express\u00e3o e \n\nEduca\u00e7\u00e3o F\u00edsica, no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico; (ii) analisar as diferen\u00e7as na compet\u00eancia \n\naqu\u00e1tica adquirida entre dois programas similares de ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, orientados em \n\ncontextos de profundidade distintos (\u00e1gua rasa e profunda); (iii) analisar as mudan\u00e7as \n\nlongitudinais no desenvolvimento motor global de crian\u00e7as, ap\u00f3s cinco, dez e 30 meses de \n\npr\u00e1tica de nata\u00e7\u00e3o e de futebol. \n\nM\u00e9todos: Para o primeiro estudo, a amostra incluiu 89 coordenadores pedag\u00f3gicos de escolas \n\nde nata\u00e7\u00e3o e 100 professores de nata\u00e7\u00e3o. Em ambos os grupos amostrais, foram aplicados \n\nquestion\u00e1rios com vista a apurar a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e metodologia de ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, no contexto \n\nparticular do primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico. O question\u00e1rio aos coordenadores incluiu os \n\nseguintes itens: (i) caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o geral dos coordenadores com e sem nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo \n\ndo ensino b\u00e1sico e professores; (ii) caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o institucional das escolas de \n\nnata\u00e7\u00e3o em estudo; (iii) enquadramento do ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico \n\n(quando existe). O question\u00e1rio aos professores que ministravam aulas de nata\u00e7\u00e3o a crian\u00e7as \n\ndo primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico (em contexto escolar) incluiu os seguintes itens: (i) \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o geral dos inquiridos; (ii) enquadramento / finalidade do ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\ncrian\u00e7as no 1\u00ba CEB; (iii) enquadramento do ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico, \n\nconhecimento das diretrizes para o ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o dadas pelo Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nPortugal; (iv) organiza\u00e7\u00e3o metodol\u00f3gica do ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, no primeiro ciclo do ensino \n\nb\u00e1sico. Tratando-se de uma pesquisa de campo, foi utilizada estat\u00edstica descritiva para a an\u00e1lise \n\ndos dados, em particular o c\u00e1lculo das frequ\u00eancias das respostas.  \n\nPara o segundo estudo, foi recrutada uma amostra de 21 crian\u00e7as portuguesas (4,70 \u00b1 0,51 \n\nanos), de ambos os g\u00e9neros e sem qualquer experi\u00eancia em programas de ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAs crian\u00e7as foram divididas em dois grupos experimentais, que foram sujeitos a um programa \n\nsimilar de ensino da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, mas vari\u00e1vel na profundidade do espa\u00e7o aqu\u00e1tico (n=10, programa \n\naqu\u00e1tico em \u00e1gua rasa; n=11, programa aqu\u00e1tico em \u00e1gua profunda). Cada participante foi \n\navaliado duas vezes na sua prontid\u00e3o aqu\u00e1tica, utilizando um formul\u00e1rio de observa\u00e7\u00e3o de 17 \n\nhabilidades motoras aqu\u00e1ticas: durante a primeira sess\u00e3o (T0) e ap\u00f3s seis meses de pr\u00e1tica \u2013 \n\nduas sess\u00f5es por semana, no total de 48 sess\u00f5es - (T1). Recorreu-se ao test t para comparar a \n\nprofici\u00eancia aqu\u00e1tica de cada habilidade entre os grupos e a uma an\u00e1lise discriminante dos \n\nregistos de profici\u00eancia aqu\u00e1tica, para construir um modelo preditivo de ambos os contextos \n\nde pr\u00e1tica. \n\nPara o terceiro estudo, a amostra foi composta por 33 crian\u00e7as (4,8 \u00b1 0,5 anos.): 11 crian\u00e7as \n\nconstitu\u00edram o grupo de controlo (5,3 \u00b1 0,2 anos); 11 crian\u00e7as eram praticantes de futebol com \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nx \n\ncinco meses de experi\u00eancia; 11 crian\u00e7as eram praticantes de nata\u00e7\u00e3o (4,6 \u00b1 0,4 anos) com cinco \n\nmeses de experi\u00eancia. Foi utilizado o Test Gross Motor Development - 2nd Edition (TGMD-2) \n\npara avaliar o desenvolvimento motor global e a profici\u00eancia motora, em 12 habilidades \n\nmotoras fundamentais [habilidades de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o e de controlo de objetos], em tr\u00eas momentos \n\ndistintos: ap\u00f3s cinco (T5), dez (T10) e trinta (T30) meses de pr\u00e1tica desportiva. Os testes foram \n\ngravados em v\u00eddeo e, \u00e0 posterior, foram analisados e avaliados de acordo com o desempenho \n\nindividual para cada habilidade motora, de acordo com os crit\u00e9rios previamente validados. Em \n\ntodos os estudos, os dados foram agrupados e analisados estatisticamente, tendo sido \n\nconsiderado significativo um valor de p ? 0,05.  \n\nResultados: Os resultados do primeiro estudo sugerem que a nata\u00e7\u00e3o no primeiro ciclo do \n\nensino b\u00e1sico rege-se sobretudo pelas orienta\u00e7\u00f5es do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o. A restri\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nor\u00e7amental (60,0%) e a dificuldade no transporte dos alunos da escola para a piscina (54,0%) \n\ns\u00e3o as raz\u00f5es mais apontadas para a supress\u00e3o da nata\u00e7\u00e3o do plano de ensino escolar. O ensino \n\n\u00e9 dirigido fundamentalmente para o terceiro e o quarto anos (80,1%), com aulas de frequ\u00eancia \n\nsemanal (64,4%), em classes com um elevado n\u00famero de alunos (13 a 16 alunos). Os principais \n\nobjetivos das aulas est\u00e3o relacionados com a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o ao meio aqu\u00e1tico, privilegiando-se as \n\nhabilidades aqu\u00e1ticas b\u00e1sicas (81,4%), num ensino pouco suportado em material pedag\u00f3gico. \n\nNo segundo estudo, os resultados sugerem que o ensino em baixa profundidade permite adquirir \n\num maior grau de compet\u00eancia aqu\u00e1tica, em particular nas seguintes habilidades aqu\u00e1ticas \n\nb\u00e1sicas (p&lt;0,05): controlo respirat\u00f3rio, imers\u00e3o da face e abertura dos olhos; flutua\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhorizontal; posi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal (equil\u00edbrio) no deslize ventral; posi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal (equil\u00edbrio) no \n\ndeslize dorsal; batimento de pernas ventral com controlo respirat\u00f3rio, sem apoio de material \n\nflutuador. A fun\u00e7\u00e3o discriminante revelou uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o significativa entre os dois grupos e \n\nem quatro fatores (habilidades aqu\u00e1ticas) (p&lt;0,001), representando (0,938) ^ 2 = 88% entre \n\nvariabilidade do grupo. A posi\u00e7\u00e3o corporal no deslize foi o principal preditor relevante (r = \n\n0,535). No terceiro estudo, os resultados sugerem que ambos os grupos (futebol e nata\u00e7\u00e3o) \n\nmelhoraram significativamente no seu quociente motor bruto e nos seus scores padr\u00e3o, na \n\nlocomo\u00e7\u00e3o e controlo de objetos entre T5 e T10. Em T10, todos os praticantes de futebol \n\nalcan\u00e7aram a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima descritiva para o quociente motor bruto. Entre T10 e T30, \n\nos praticantes de nata\u00e7\u00e3o melhoraram os scores padr\u00e3o no controlo de objetos. Ap\u00f3s 30 meses \n\nde pr\u00e1tica desportiva, n\u00e3o foram encontradas diferen\u00e7as significativas (p> 0,05) entre ambos \n\nos grupos experimentais. \n\nConclus\u00f5es: Os dados relatados no primeiro estudo permitiram-nos identificar algumas \n\ninsufici\u00eancias no enquadramento da nata\u00e7\u00e3o, no primeiro ciclo do ensino b\u00e1sico, provavelmente \n\npor condicionantes da efici\u00eancia do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, ao n\u00edvel da aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nhabilidades aqu\u00e1ticas mais complexas. No segundo estudo, os resultados demonstram que as \n\nsess\u00f5es de nata\u00e7\u00e3o em \u00e1gua rasa parecem permitir um desenvolvimento superior da \n\ncompet\u00eancia aqu\u00e1tica em crian\u00e7as, ap\u00f3s um per\u00edodo de seis meses de pr\u00e1tica. No \u00faltimo \n\nestudo, os dados sugerem que a pr\u00e1tica desportiva (nata\u00e7\u00e3o e futebol), durante a inf\u00e2ncia, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nxi \n\npode contribuir para um maior desenvolvimento motor. Apesar da pr\u00e1tica de futebol parecer \n\ninduzir um desenvolvimento motor acelerado e superior (a curto e longo prazo), em compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom a pr\u00e1tica de nata\u00e7\u00e3o, os praticantes de nata\u00e7\u00e3o apresentaram um desenvolvimento motor \n\ngradual, particularmente em habilidades de controlo de objeto. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nxii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nxiii \n\nAbstract \n\nObjective: This thesis includes three studies related to the teaching of swimming, with the \n\nfollowing objectives: (i) to describe the organization and methodology of swimming teaching in \n\nPortugal, in the context of school education (elementary school); (ii) to analyze and compare \n\nthe efficiency between the two program types of swimming teaching (practice in shallow water \n\nand practice in deep water); (iii) to analyze the longitudinal changes in the gross motor \n\ndevelopment of children, after five, ten and 30 months practicing swimming and soccer in \n\nparallel. Methods: For the first study, the sample included 89 pedagogical coordinators of \n\nswimming schools and 100 swimming teachers. We have done a survey with both groups to \n\nassess the level of organization and methodology of swimming teaching.  For the second study, \n\nthe sample was composed by 21 children (4.70 \u00b1 0.51years), of both genders and with no \n\nexperience with swimming learning programs. The sample was organized in two experimental \n\ngroups, which have followed a similar swimming learning program during six months, but using \n\ndifferent water depths (one using shallow water, the other using deep water). For the third \n\nstudy, the sample was composed by 33 children (4.8 \u00b1 0.5 years). The sample was organized in \n\nthree groups: control group, soccer group, swimming group. We have used the Test Gross Motor \n\nDevelopment \u2013 2nd Edition to evaluate the gross motor development in three different \n\nmoments: after five, ten and 30 months of practice of both sports. Results: the results of the \n\nfirst study indicate that the swimming practice in the elementary school is conducted following \n\nthe orientations from the Portuguese Ministry of Education. At this level, the swimming practice \n\nis focused on the aquatic readiness, giving more attention to basic aquatic skills (81.4%), where \n\nthe teaching model rarely includes pedagogical material. In the second study, the results \n\nindicate that we can achieve a better performance (higher level of aquatic competence) in \n\nshallow water than in deep water, especially with acquiring the five basic aquatic skills. In the \n\nthird study, the results indicate that, in both groups (soccer and swimming), there\u2019s a \n\nsignificant improvement of the gross motor coefficient and the standard scores in the \n\nlocomotion and control of objects, between T5 and T10. The soccer practitioners have reached \n\nthe higher motor development coefficient, after 10 months of practice. The swimming \n\npractitioners have a gradual motor development (between T10 and T30), especially with \n\nregards to object control skills. Conclusions: with the data of the first study, we could find \n\nsome deficiencies in the integration of swimming practice in the elementary school\u2019s program \n\nand probably those are limitations of the efficiency of the teaching method adopted, in respect \n\nto the acquisition of more complex aquatic skills. By the results of the second study, the \n\ndevelopment of aquatic skills, by children after six months of practice, seems to be easier in \n\nshallow water that in deep water. The data collected with the last study indicate that sports \n\n(both swimming and soccer) during childhood can contribute for a higher gross motor \n\ndevelopment of children. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n

The clarification of the paradigm subjacent to the swimming teaching, recognizing the \n\ncurrent methodological principals accepted among the scientific community, that can \n\nbe the guidance to both the subsequent development of scientific research and to the \n\npedagogical intervention and organization;  \n\n? The recognition of the importance of the psychomotor stimulation during childhood, \n\nemphasizing the importance of swimming practice in the global development of \n\nchildren. \n\nOver the next sections, we will briefly frame out the key information about these topics and \n\nwill finish by presenting the relevant implications on the overall structure of this thesis. \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Theoretical concepts related to the swimming teaching \n\nTheoretical knowledge of swimming teaching requires the correct understanding of the \n\nconcepts \"aquatic competence\u201d and \u201clearn to swim\", which are, in fact, conceptually different, \n\nalthough they are traditionally considered to be the same or related things. Therefore, we \n\nshould start a swimming teaching program by assuming the individual has a total inability in the \n\naquatic environment, or is not capable at all of performing any oriented action in the water \n\n(Canossa, Fernandes, Carmo, Andrade, &amp; Soares, 2007). Indeed, the movement in the aquatic \n\nenvironment is peculiar and unfriendly: the water affects and modifies the person\u2019s motor \n\ncontrol because it generates permanent lack of balance and comfort (eyes, nose, ears and \n\nmouth). In fact, this impact is caused by the physical and chemical properties of the water and \n\nits intrinsic mechanism, which are shaping the interaction of this environment with bodies in \n\ncontact with or moving through it.  Considering such differences when comparing the aquatic \n\nenvironment with the terrestrial environment, it is mandatory to develop specific skills to \n\novercome the constraint we find in this particular environment, with respect to balance, \n\npropulsion and breathing in the water. Thus, the main objective of the adaptation to the \n\naquatic environment, while an elementary step of the swimming learning, is to achieve a \n\ngradual acquisition of competences in the water, which represents the starting point and is a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\nspecific motor pre-requirement (i.e., basic movement skills in the water) for the practice of \n\nseveral water activities, such as swimming.  \n\nAccording to Campani\u00e7o (1989), we use the control of the body in the water, based on a \n\nbehavioral differentiation in five areas: balance, breathing, immersion, propulsion and jump. \n\nThis way, the ability of swimming cannot be a natural skill (Langendorfer, 2014). There\u2019s no \n\ndoubt this is an ability the individual has to acquire by himself, to allow him/her to perform \n\nthe proper actions towards achieving the required balance, breathing and propulsion (Barbosa, \n\n2005). According to several authors (Campani\u00e7o &amp; Silva, 1998; Carvalho, 1994; Catteau &amp; \n\nGaroff, 1990; Crespo &amp; Sanchez, 1998; Navarro, 1995; Moreno &amp; Sanmart\u00edn, 1998), the ability \n\nof swimming, besides representing a specific movement skill in the water, requires a previous \n\ncondition of autonomy, confidence and satisfaction in the new environment. Therefore, and \n\nregardless of the use given to the swimming practice (educational or merely utilitarian \n\npurpose), it is very important that the priority of the didactic and pedagogical organization \n\nmodel of the swimming teaching should not be the immediate achievement of formal strokes, \n\nbut, instead, the achievement of confidence by the child in the new environment. It is essential \n\nthat researchers and teachers assume a developing and holistic approach of swimming learning. \n\nIt seems that this guidance is presented on the proposal by Langendorfer and Bruya (1995), \n\nwhich is used as reference along this thesis. These authors recommend that the swimming \n\nlearning should be based on a progressive behavioral change of children, resulting from the \n\nsequential learning of basic movement patterns (skills), based on three underlying \n\ncornerstones: hierarchy, differentiation and individualization of basic aquatic skills. This way, \n\nthe aquatic skills must be considered a dynamic process that depends on the interaction of \n\neach individual with the water. This has relevant implications, including the prevention of \n\ndrowning (Langendorfer, 2014). \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Developing aquatic competence in young children \n\nA well-succeeded learning of complex motor behaviors depends on the understanding of the \n\npedagogical theory related to the sport movement education (in particular, swimming), on the \n\norganization and hierarchy of educational content and also on the correct teaching of it, which \n\nis, at the same, an importance level of the rest. \n\nWith respect to the conceptual pedagogical understanding, the previous section has already \n\naddressed some of the key aspects that sustain the consequent didactics. In fact, we previously \n\ninsisted on the importance of the aquatic competence that reflects the individual\u2019s readiness \n\nto move in the water. Nevertheless, it\u2019s also important to take into account other kind of \n\nunderstanding the teacher may have, as a person with his/her own perspective, someone who \n\ntakes decisions, makes his/her own judgments and holds a certain guidance he/she believes to \n\nbe appropriated to his/her professional activity (Carreiro da Costa, 1996). What objective do \n\nthe teachers give to the training of the adaptation to the water? This is a concern which arises \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\nfrom the known paradigm \"teacher\u2019s thought\" (Clark &amp; Lampert, 1986), which has great impact \n\nto the didactics of physical education, including, of course, the teaching of swimming. In fact, \n\nit is our perception that the technical community tends, sometimes, to disregard the basic \n\naquatic skills as a bio-behavioral requirement to learn more complex and specialized aquatic \n\nskills (including the traditional four swimming strokes). This empirical sense seems to be \n\nreflected on the results presented by Costa et al. (2012), when they inquired swimming \n\nteachers about the main objective of teaching the adaptation to the water. The results revealed \n\nthat the purpose \"learn to swim\" inevitably emerges as the most important goal of aquatic \n\nprograms developed in deep water. However, we must highlight the alarming fact of the goal \n\n\"don\u2019t be afraid of water\" doesn\u2019t collect a 100% acceptance, although the \"pleasure of practice\" \n\nis seen as a consensual point. Several unstudied individual and institutional constraints will \n\nconverge together to this conceptual misrepresentation. \n\n\u201cHow to teach aquatic skills and swimming?\u201d This is another pedagogical issue we consider to \n\nbe fundamental to the didactics of swimming, eventually delimited and included in a study \n\ncategory of the theoretical-implicit type, pre-conceptual and linked to the believing of teachers \n\nand their relationship with the teaching activity (Carreiro da Costa, 1996). The literature \n\nrelated to the teaching of swimming is poor in this topic.  However, and assuming that is only \n\naccepted systematized teaching methods, we globally consider two pedagogical perspectives: \n\nthe analytical perspective and the synthetic perspective (Catteau &amp; Garrof, 1990; Machado, \n\n1978). The validity of both perspectives to the teaching of swimming is undeniable, which \n\nmakes difficult to define the limits of the application of each one (Marques &amp; Gallardo, 2009). \n\nAccording to the authors, it is possible to speculate a bigger analytical tendency to the teaching \n\nof students already familiar with the water, more mature and wishing to learn swimming in a \n\nmore efficient way, since it allows the rationalization and fragmentation of the swimming \n\ntechnique and make it closer to the biomechanical model of reference. The syntactic \n\nperspective, based on psychological approach of Gestalt (Greco, 1998), appears to be more \n\nappropriate in the process of adaptation to water, for beginner students of young age, since it \n\nputs such exercise in a certain context, getting the student's attention to solve adaptation \n\nissues. \n\nThis logic allows us to understand the reason of certain behaviors in the teaching of swimming \n\nand, consequently, explain the swimming teaching-learning process. This leads us to several \n\nissues related to teacher\u2019s planning (Carreiro da Costa, 1996), mainly the following ones: what's \n\nthe teacher's thought when is making the plan and what are the differences of planning between \n\nteachers and in different contexts of learning? So, let\u2019s drawn our attention to the teacher\u2019s \n\nreflections when he/she is building up the teaching model \u2013 the set of specific strategies that \n\ncome up when the sequence of the important aquatic skills is defined (Campani\u00e7o &amp; Silva, \n\n1998).  \n\nThe balance between the planning, teacher\u2019s behavior and student\u2019s characteristics is another \n\nimportant concern to the teaching paradigm. This issue has a special importance in adapting \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\nchildren to the aquatic environment, given the fact that is necessary to adjust the teaching \n\nmodel according to the child\u2019s global development, especially in the cognitive, social and motor \n\ndomains (Langerdorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995). Only this way can provide relevant experiences for a \n\ngradual acquisition of movement skills in the water, adjusted to the age and suitable to a \n\ncertain level of technical proficiency. This topic is discussed in more detail along the next \n\nsection.  \n\nFinally, it is important to highlight there are several variables involved in the swimming \n\nteaching-learning process, most of them related to the particular characteristics of the water \n\nenvironment. In line with the process-product paradigm of Pi\u00e9ron (1988) (figure 1), we assume \n\nthat the final stage of the student\u2019s learning depends directly from the process\u2019s variables, \n\nwhich are in turn influenced by the variables of the presage, context and program.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Process-product paradigm (according to Pi\u00e9ron, 1988). \n\n \n\nWe are interested, in particular, in the context variables that affect the teacher's behavior, \n\nteaching organization and, as such, that determine the effectiveness of learning (Zuo, 2004). \n\nIn fact, beyond the constraints imposed directly to the child by the characteristics of the \n\naquatic environment (mentioned earlier), the teaching quality depends on the conditions \n\navailable for teaching, the space allocated to the group of students and their learning capacity \n\n(Carvalho, 1994). According to several authors (Langendorfer, 2010; Murray, 1980 cited by Costa \n\net al, 2012) these factors are: (i) the number of students in the class; (ii) the available \n\nequipment; (iii) the water temperature; (iv) the weekly frequency of classes and (v) the depth \n\nof the swimming pool. \n\nOutput variables \n\n \n\n(Short-term effects, long-\n\nterm effects) \n\n \n\nProcess variables \n\n \n\n(Teacher\u2019s behavior, \n\nstudent\u2019s behavior, \n\nobservable changes in the \n\nstudent\u2019s behavior) \n\n \n\nProgram variables \n\n \n\n(Types of goals, nature of \n\ncontent, evaluation \n\nprocedures) \n\nContext variables \n\n \n\n(Student\u2019s characteristics; \n\nequipment; educational \n\ninvolvement) \n\n \n\nPresage variables \n\n \n\n(Professional qualifications, \n\nwork experience, teacher\u2019s \n\ncharacteristics) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\nDespite of the lack of studies on this subject, the effect of some of these factors in the \n\neffectiveness of swimming teaching-learning process can be deduced based on the literature of \n\neducational sciences (Vickers, 1990). Indeed, a number of excessive class size affects \n\nundoubtedly the safety, effectiveness and quality of teaching, especially because the teacher \n\nhas to give attention to more students. Regarding the weekly frequency of classes, it is well \n\nknown that systematization of learning-teaching process (and also for successful sporting \n\nperformance) is a basic requirement for behavioral modifications \u2013 in this context, it\u2019s expect \n\nto have a bigger effect (both in the short and long term) on the acquisition of aquatic skills, \n\nwith a program composed by three weekly sessions, comparing with a program with just one or \n\ntwo sessions per week.  \n\nThere isn\u2019t much information about studies done on the effectiveness of didactic equipment to \n\nuse in the swimming learning, including floating devices (Erbaugh, 1986). One of the few studies \n\nin this domain has demonstrated the importance of the use of these devices in the horizontal \n\ndynamic balance. However, other authors (Blanksby, Parker, Bradley, &amp; Ong, 1995; \n\nLangendorfer, 1987) advise not to use these devices in the learning of fluctuation and \n\nhydrodynamic positioning. The main reason seems to be the reasonable use of auxiliary devices \n\n(Barbosa, 2004; Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno &amp; Sanmartin, 1998; Navarro, 1995), \n\navoiding student\u2019s dependence on a false perception of autonomy, which leads to the \n\ndevelopment of artificial aquatic skills (Soares, 2000). This appears to be the same \n\nunderstanding of the teachers of some Portuguese swimming schools that have a moderate use \n\nof didactic material in the adaptation to the water environment, where boards are the favorite \n\nequipment (Costa et al., 2012). \n\nWith regards to the water temperature, both the international recommendations (Water &amp; \n\nWorld Health Organization, 2006) and the national recommendations (Normative 23/93 CNQ) \n\nsuggest values between 30 \u00baC and 32\u00baC. To our knowledge there are no studies demonstrating \n\nthe effectiveness of the swimming teaching-learning process, in difference levels of \n\ntemperature. Such studies should have to consider the characteristics of the students and the \n\nteaching program, which tends to be more \"active\" with lower temperatures. According to \n\nMcArdle, Katch and Katch (2014), the ideal water temperature in competition should range \n\nfrom 28\u00baC to 30\u00baC, since the metabolic heat generated is easily transferred to the water without \n\nsignificant increases in the energy spending or reduction of the body\u2019s temperature.  \n\nFrom all context factors, the depth of the swimming pool seems to be the less studied factor. \n\nThe recent study from Costa et al. (2012), one of few existing studies in this matter, analyzes \n\nthe effects on the development of aquatic skills in two depth scenarios (shallow water and deep \n\nwater), after six, 12 and 18 months of practice. Although the study design is cross-sectional, \n\nthe results seem to indicate that children with up to 12 months of practice in shallow water \n\nhave better results.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n1.1.3 Motor development and aquatic experience \n\nMotor development, as part of the overall development of the human being, changes during \n\nperson\u2019s life. Although being frequently associated with childhood, we can see qualitative and \n\nquantitative changes in the proficiency of these motor actions from the conception of the \n\nhuman being to his death (Connolly, 2000; Santos, Dantas, &amp; Oliveira, 2004). Despite this \n\nabsolute point of view, childhood is assumed as a crucial period for the development of physical \n\nskills and basic psychomotor learning, which allow the acquisition of a diverse set of motor \n\ncapabilities that will help the child to gradually develop more complex movements. It should \n\nbe understood this is a sequential process, sustained in the child\u2019s experiences that contribute \n\nto a solid and wide set of motor capabilities (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun 2005; Le boulch, 1987; Piaget, \n\n1975; Vygotsky, 1978). \n\nThe motor development refers to changes in general categories of motor behavior (locomotion, \n\nmanipulation and stabilization) conditioned by stimulation received and by the predisposition \n\nof the child to interact with the environment (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005). In this context, the \n\nlack of motor stimulation and wrong orientation of them may have a negative impact in the \n\nmotor development expected to happen in that age (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005; Le Boulch, 1987; \n\nPiaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978), besides affecting the functional autonomy of the child in the \n\ndaily life. Therefore, it\u2019s extremely important to take good care of children\u2019s motor literacy, \n\nlooking for having good levels of development of fundamental movement skills suitable for that \n\nage.  These are considered to be building blocks of an appropriate level of physical fitness in \n\nthe health perspective, and of the learning of specific motor skills required for sports \n\nmodalities.  \n\nThe category of locomotor movements refers to the changing of body\u2019s position in respect to a \n\nfixed point on the surface. It involves the projection of the human body on an external area, \n\nby changing body\u2019s position in respect to a fixed point on the surface (e.g.: walking, running, \n\njumping or skipping). In turn, the manipulative movements involve an individual's relationship \n\nwith objects and is characterized by the force applied on them, as well as the strength received \n\nfrom them. The actions of \"launch\", \"catch\", \"kick\" and \"intercept\" objects are considered thick \n\nmanipulative movements; movements like cutting with scissors are fine motor movements. The \n\nstabilization movements are those that allow the body to assume a posture in the space, in \n\nrelation to the force of gravity. In this category, the child is involved in continuous efforts \n\nagainst the force of gravity, in an attempt to obtain and maintain bipedal posture. \n\nIt is well known that, during the typical child's development, he/she goes through several stages \n\n(Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005), where there are periods of greater physical and cognitive \n\nwillingness to assimilate and improve motor skills (Peres, Serrano, &amp; Cunha, 2009). In fact, the \n\ntheoretical model of Gallahue and Ozmun (2005) seems to be the consensus in terms of existing \n\nliterature, suggesting four major phases of stable behavior, or, at least, relatively consistent: \n\nreflex movements, rudimentary movements, basic movements and specialized movements. For \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\neach phase of the process are indicated stages with corresponding (presumed) chronological \n\nages. This phase-stage process was conceptualized in the form of a heuristic hourglass (Gallahue \n\n&amp; Ozmun, 2005), as shown in Figure 2; this framework is the typical motor development \n\nthroughout lifetime, where the inverted triangle is a schematic representation of the \n\ntransactional processes that affect the motor development (task, individual and environment). \n\nMost children have a great potential for development of fundamental movement skills, that \n\nallows the child to start his/her transaction to the phase of specialized movements, around the \n\nage of 6 years old (Gallahue, 2005). The development of fundamental movement follows a \n\nsequence of stages, characterized by gradual proficiency levels, reflecting the quality of one\u2019s \n\nmotor control (Carvalhal, 2000; Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005): \n\nInitial stage: in this stage, children try their first movements, which are incomplete and \n\nuncoordinated, with no rhythmic coordination. In a nutshell, these movements have a poor \n\nspace-time integration;  \n\nElementary stage: during this stage, children have greater control of their movements and have \n\nbetter rhythmic and space-time coordination. However, there is still a lack of spontaneity at \n\nthis stage. Most adults remain at this stage, since they progress up to it just because of the \n\ninfluence of the maturity;  \n\nMature stage: most fundamental motor skills can be reached at the age of six or seven years \n\nold, but some kids may reach this stage earlier. This stage is characterized as being more \n\neffective and revealing coordinated and controlled movements.  \n\nAccording to Gallahue (2005), the anatomical, physiological and neural characteristics are \n\nenough developed towards operating in a mature stage for the majority of fundamental \n\nmovement skills. The exceptions are mainly a result of limited opportunities to practice. For \n\nall this, the coordinated practice of sports can play a catalytic role, because it gives the \n\nopportunity of performing important motor experiences that include stimulation to develop \n\nfundamental motor skills (Martins, Silva, Marinho, &amp; Costa, 2015; Pereira, 1990) and its \n\nsubsequent optimization to the specific context of each sport. These are considered an \n\nessential part to both appropriate physical capability, in a health perspective, and to the \n\nlearning of specific movement skills necessary to the practice of the sport modalities (Flinchum, \n\n1982; Gallahue, 2006; Harrow, 1983; Tani, 2011). It is clearly a key period to contact with new \n\nsports and different contexts of practice, including swimming (Martins et al., 2015). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Descriptive model (heuristic hourglass) of a motor development during lifetime (Gallahue \n&amp; Ozmun, 2006; adapted from Gallahue, 2005). \n\n \n\nSwimming is one of the few guided physical activities that can be practiced starting from the \n\nsix months of age (Moreno, Pena, Castillo, &amp; Vegu\u00e9, 2004) and about which is believed to \n\ncontribute to the harmonious development of the child (Gallahue, 1993). However, the studies \n\nin this area are particularly rare, focusing especially on children with disabilities (Beckung, \n\nCarlsson, Carlsdotter, &amp; Uvebrant, 2007; Bredekamp, &amp; Copple, 1997; Haywood &amp; Getchell, \n\n2004). We highlight the work from Fragala?Pinkham, Haley, &amp; O\u2019Neil (2008) and Hutzler, \n\nChacham, Bergman, and Szeinberg (1998), which demonstrates the effects of water activities \n\nin the increase of mobility and muscle strength in children with physical disabilities. In respect \n\nto babies, early aquatic experience seems to improve some motor skills, such as balance, and \n\nachieve motor development of newborn babies, including the head control. The studies are \n\neven rarer in respect to the childhood phase. Even so, it is expected to have a positive effect \n\non the gross and fine motor capability of children between seven and nine years old (Paula &amp; \n\nBelo, 2009). In the school context, the aquatic experience seems to lead to an optimal state of \n\nmotor development in various skills, particularly in the manipulation of objects (Martins et al., \n\n2015). Other studies have found effects on the neuromuscular development and on the \n\nperformance of the cardiovascular and respiratory system (Zhao et al., 2005). Bernard (2010); \n\nFont-Ribera et al., (2011) ;Wang and Hung (2009) demonstrates a positive impact of swimming \n\nin children with cardiorespiratory diseases (e.g.: asthma). Other authors (Gorter &amp; Currie, 2011; \n\nEnvironment  Heredity \n\nEnvironment factors Individual factors \n\nTask\u2019s factors \n\nMotor control and \n\nMovement Skills \n\nSpecialized movements \n\n \n\nFundamental \n\nmovements \n\n \n\nRudimentary \n\nmovements \n\n \n\nReflex movements \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\nKemp &amp; Roberts, 2005; McManus &amp; Kotelchuck 2007; Wicher, et al., 2010) refer to supporting \n\neffects at different levels: reduction of behavior and sleep disorders; anorexia; neuro-\n\npsychomotor development deficits; hypotonia; orthopedic, neurological and respiratory \n\ndisorders. More recently (Jorgensen, 2012), studies have demonstrated the positive and \n\nsignificant effect of swimming (comparing with the population in general) on the intellectual \n\ndevelopment, particularly language. \n\n \n\n1.2 Problem definition and objective of this thesis \n\nThe previous theoretical framework put us under three main concerns that made us do this \n\nwork. \n\nThe first concern is closely related to the swimming in the elementary school, which was \n\nformally established by decision of the Minister of Education of Portugal (Despacho n\u00ba \n\n12591/2006 \u2013 DR n\u00ba 115, Series II, 2006-06-16), in which the physical activities are included in \n\nthe education offer. This program aimed to guarantee all students access to a set of activities \n\nthat would add value to their school program, in the elementary school, with the objective of \n\ndeveloping the child\u2019s capacity in several domains (e.g.: psychomotor, social-affective and \n\ncognitive) (Fialho et al., 2013). With respect to physical activities and sports, the available \n\nprogram guidelines (Maria &amp; Nunes, 2006) define the objectives and the program\u2019s generic \n\noperationalization, while giving great flexibility to extend the field of physical and motor \n\nexperience of children. In this context, swimming is considered optional, although this activity \n\nwas appointed as an activity \u201cnever or rarely\u201d introduced (77.3%), despite being a favorite \n\nactivity for the students (47.9%) (Fialho et al., 2013). However, we couldn\u2019t find any study \n\nabout neither the way the contents are implemented or supervised, nor the effectiveness of \n\nthe implemented programs.  It\u2019s therefore important to know how the swimming teaching is \n\norganized and the existing teaching methodologies. This need has triggered the following \n\nquestion: How is the swimming teaching included in the Physical and Motor Education program, \n\nduring elementary education in Portugal?  \n\nOur second concern is related to the fact there are almost no studies about the influence of \n\nseveral context factors that are linked to the acquisition of aquatic skills by small kids. One of \n\nthe key factors seems to be the variation of water\u2019s depth, very common in swimming schools \n\nin Portugal, both in the educational and non-educational offers. Excluding the cases where \n\nthere\u2019s no infrastructural alternative, we believe the reasons the adaptation to aquatic \n\nenvironment is done in deep water are the following: technical decision or merely commercial \n\nmanagement. The reason for the first situation is mainly empirical, because there are almost \n\nno studies about this topic and the existing ones \u2013 as far as we know \u2013 follow a basic approach \n\nand with no control of the educational program used. Regarding the second situation, technical-\n\nscientific arguments are excluded but also the regulatory ones, given the fact there\u2019s no \n\nspecific legislation about the swimming teaching, especially with regards to the safety rules \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\n(size of classes, water\u2019s depth adjusted to the leaning level). Therefore, we make the following \n\nquestion: Does the depth of water, during aquatic competence lessons, bring any impact to \n\nthe acquisition of basic water skills by children?  \n\nThe third concern of this dissertation is about the dependency of the motor development from \n\nsport practices (Kambas et al., 2012). In the same reason a reduced or inadequate physical \n\nstimulation may affect the child\u2019s motor development (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005; Williams et \n\nal., 2008), an inadequate motor development will be inhibitory for the practice of physical \n\nactivity (e.g. Stodden et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008).  In the long run, it will create a higher \n\nprobability of the child to be sedentary when he/she becomes adult (Huotari, Nupponen, Mik-\n\nkelsson, Laakso &amp; Kujala, 2011). Therefore, we must consider the childhood is not just a critical \n\nage to develop motor capabilities, but to enable the child to practice sport (Barnett, Beurden, \n\nMorgan, Brooks, &amp; Beard, 2009; Stodden et al., 2008).  \n\nLike we mentioned before, achieving a mature stage of these capabilities is closely dependent \n\non the opportunities to practice physical activities (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005). Normally, the \n\nstudies address the effects the community\u2019s intervention has on this matter, choosing \n\nexperimental designs with isolated groups (with no control group) and during small periods of \n\ntime (less than six months) (Smith et al., 2014). The catalytic role of the formal sport practice \n\nin the gross motor development is, therefore, very little known. We consider this lack of \n\nliterature of special importance mainly because several kids don\u2019t benefit from a structured \n\nsport practice at school, especially during the preschool. The motor experiences during the \n\nchildhood (especially at the age of six) result quite often from the practice of sports by the \n\ninitiative of the child and his/her family and not necessarily from an official program (for \n\ninstance at school). In this context, swimming is one of the most favorite sports. By itself, the \n\nwater seems to provide important stimulations to the body\u2019s perception, giving a positive effect \n\nover prehension and balance (Sigmundsson &amp; Hopkins, 2010). Besides that, the games and \n\nseveral other fun activities are an appropriate methodology to achieve the aquatic readiness \n\nat that age levels. Thus, it\u2019s important to evaluate the following: which effects can we expect \n\nfrom the oriented practice of sports and in particular from swimming, in the gross motor \n\ndevelopment of child? \n\nConsidering that the study\u2019s problem is defined, and aiming to bring a contribution to the state \n\nof art of this scientific domain, the study has the following objectives: \n\nTo analyze the implementation of a swimming program included in the scope of the Expression \n\nand Physical Motor Education, in the elementary school, in Portugal, specifically describing: (a) \n\nthe methodological organization of swimming teaching; (b) the methodologies of teaching \n\nswimming actually used; (c) the application of the teaching-learning process, especially by \n\nidentifying the privileged aquatic skills; (d) the reason to have a swimming program.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\nTo analyze the improvements of the aquatic skills of the kids, after they have accomplished \n\nthe aquatic competence program, conducted in different depth levels (shallow water and deep \n\nwater), during six months.  \n\nTo analyze the longitudinal changes in the gross motor development of children, after five, ten \n\nand 30 months practicing swimming and football.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Structure of the thesis \n\nConsidering the assumptions above, this document is organized in chapters, based on the North \n\nEuropean model (normally known as the Scandinavian model), that results from the compilation \n\nof three experimental studies.  \n\nThe text body of this dissertation is divided in five chapters. The \u201cchapter I\u201d has the overview, \n\nincluding the formal justification, the problem definition, the objectives and the presentation \n\nof the document\u2019s structure. The following three chapters (II, III and IV) result each one from \n\nthe three main points of this dissertation: the \u201cchapter II\u201d analyzes the organization and \n\nmethodology of the swimming teaching, in the elementary school in Portugal; the \u201cchapter III\u201d \n\npresents the analysis of the aquatic skills acquired during two equivalent programs, one \n\nconducted in shallow water and the other in deep water; the \u201cchapter IV\u201d presents the analysis \n\nof the short term, midterm and long term effects in the child\u2019s global motor development \n\nbrought by the practice of swimming and football, during childhood. The articles are written in \n\nEnglish, following the standards proposed by the University of Beira Interior, notwithstanding \n\nthe fact they have been published under a different format by specialized journals and some \n\nof them written in Portuguese. The \u201cchapter V\u201d has the final conclusions, the limitations of the \n\ndissertation as well as questions/suggestions for future research.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n1.4 References \n\n1.

The sample included 89 pedagogical coordinators of local swimming \n\nschools and 100 swimming teachers working at those schools. Two questionnaires were used to \n\nassess the organization and teaching methodology and the results were described based on \n\ndescriptive statistical analysis. The results suggest that swimming in the first level basic \n\neducation is governed according to the guidelines from Ministry of Education. The budget cut \n\n(60.0% less) and the difficulty in transporting school students (54.0%) to the swimming pool are \n\nthe main reasons mentioned for the suppression of swimming. Teaching is primarily directed to \n\nthe third and fourth grade (80.1%), with weekly frequency (64.4%) and classes with a high \n\nnumber of students (13 to 16 students). The main objective of the classes is the children\u2019s \n\nadaptation to the aquatic environment, focusing on the basic aquatic skills (81.4%), with very \n\nlittle use of pedagogic material. With the data collected, we were able to identify some \n\nweaknesses in the framework of swimming teaching, in the 1st level of basic education, probably \n\nbecause of the constraints of the teaching-learning process, at the level of more complex skills. \n\nKeywords: Swimming; teaching methods; aquatic skills; children. \n\n \n\n2.3 Introduction \n\nThe overall development of the child is sequential and cumulative, sustained in experiences \n\nthat contribute to a solid group of motor skills (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun 2005; Le Boulch, 1987; \n\nPiaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978). Childhood is seen as a critical period for the development of \n\nphysical skills and basic psychomotor learning, extending this period up to the age of the last \n\nyear of the 1st level of basic education. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\nBesides that, and according to the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (2008), the \n\nphysical exercise during childhood brings a lot of benefits to children\u2019s development (social, \n\ncognitive and physical), in the mid and long term, such as reducing the fat mass, reducing the \n\nrisk of cardiovascular diseases, type two diabetes and psychological benefits (psychological \n\nwell-being, self-esteem, reduce anxiety and depression). A recent study (Huotari et al., 2011) \n\nshows that children and adolescents that are physically active have less probability to be \n\nsedentary when they are adults. On the other hand, we also know that the lack or bad motor \n\nstimulation can have a very negative impact in the child\u2019s development (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, \n\n2005; Leboulch, 1987; Piaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978). \n\nIn this perspective, we consider the swimming practice during childhood a harmonious exercise \n\nthat contributes to the full development of the child and, at the same time, reduces the risk \n\nof drowning. However, to our knowledge there are no solid scientific evidences that aquatic \n\nactivities actually reduce the risk of drowning (Asher, Rivara, Felix, Vance &amp; Dunne, 1995). \n\nRegarding the motor development, the study of Zhao et al. (2005) reports positive effects of \n\nthe application of aquatic activity programs. Additionally, it was observed a positive impact on \n\nthe neuromuscular development and on the functional capacity of the cardiovascular and \n\nrespiratory systems. Other authors (Kemp &amp; Roberts, 2005; McManus &amp; Kotelchuk 2007 Wicher, \n\net al, 2010; Gorter &amp; Currie, 2011) refer supporting effects at different levels: reduction of \n\nbehavior and sleep disorders; anorexia; deficit of the neuro-psychomotor development; \n\nhypotonias; orthopedic, neurological and respiratory disorders. In addition to these benefits, \n\nthe practice of swimming naturally contributes to the learning of basic, specific and complex \n\nmotor skills in a wider context of aquatic competence (Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995) that should \n\nbe developed particularly during childhood (Blanksby et al., 1995). However, there are \n\nlimitations to the swimming practice, which often requires a prior medical advice. Hearing \n\nprotection should be used to prevent in the case of otitis, sinusitis and chronic rhinitis as well \n\nas appropriate water glasses to protect eye sensitivity. \n\nThe Expression and Physical Motor Education, as part of the required range of activities included \n\nin the program of the first level of basic education, which encompasses several key content to \n\nthe child's development, includes swimming as one of the optional modalities of the program. \n\nDue to the unique characteristics of this sport, the need of special facilities and teachers with \n\nthe right preparation, it\u2019s not always possible to include swimming in the regular school \n\nprogram. Besides that, the quality of the swimming teaching depends on many factors, mainly \n\nthose that directly influence its organization and, therefore, determine its effectiveness.  \n\nAccording  to Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campani\u00e7o (1989), we refer particularly to \n\nthe following factors: (i) the number of students \u2013 as a factor that determines the quality of \n\neducation; (ii) the didactic material - that allows variability of stimulations in the class; (iii) \n\nwater temperature \u2013 that should range between 30\u00ba and 32\u00ba C; (iv) the number of classes per \n\nweek - usually two times in childhood (between three and ten years old); (v) the depth of the \n\nswimming pool \u2013 making use of several methodological strategies used in deep swimming pools, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\nwhen the class is small (six to twelve students). According to Carvalho (1994), the quality of \n\neducation depends on the teaching conditions, the space available to the class and is related \n\nto the learning progress of the students. \n\nAlthough there are guidelines about how to develop physical exercise and sports during the \n\nelementary school, currently there are no studies in Portugal about how this is done on the \n\nfield and about the achievements made. Moreover, the commission that is responsible to \n\nsupervise the application of the program, which presents annual pedagogical reports, has been \n\nsaying that the mechanisms to collect report data are not compliant with the teaching program, \n\nbesides the fact that there is relevant data that is not being considered and other data that is \n\nbeing collected but not always relevant for such analysis. \n\nTherefore, in this study we have decided to describe and analyze the implementation of the \n\nswimming program in the context of the Expression and Physical Motor Education class of the \n\nelementary school in Portugal, currently conducted by the Local Administration. We aim to \n\nknow the following topics: (i) the organization of teaching methodology; (ii) the methodologies \n\napplied in swimming practice; (iii) the effective implementation of the teaching-learning \n\nprocess (identify which basic aquatic skills are preferential); (iv) find out why swimming is not \n\nincluded in the school program. \n\n \n\n2.4 Method \n\n2.4.1 Experimental design \n\nThis study is essentially a descriptive field research, with a quantitative analysis of the data \n\ncollected, which main purpose is to know the teaching of swimming, in the context of the \n\nExpression and Physical Motor Education class, in the elementary school in Portugal. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Sample \n\nData was collected during the school year of 2010/2011, in 89 Portuguese municipalities \u2013 \n\nmunicipal swimming pools that participated in this study, corresponding to 30.2% of the \n\nPortuguese municipalities (table 1). The 89 pedagogical coordinators of those swimming schools \n\nwere divided in two groups:  \n\nMunicipal swimming pools that are providing swimming classes to the local elementary school \n\n(corresponding to a total of 59 pedagogical coordinators \u2013 47 men and 12 women);  \n\nMunicipal swimming pools that are not providing swimming classes to the local elementary \n\nschool (corresponding to a total of 30 pedagogical coordinators \u2013 26 men and four women); \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\nAdditionally, 100 swimming teachers, teaching swimming in the elementary school at those \n\nlocations, agreed to participate in this study (65 men and 35 women, 31.9 + 5.5 years old, 3.19 \n\n+ 0.89 years of professional experience).  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Instruments and procedures \n\nWe submitted a questionnaire to the pedagogical coordinators of swimming schools with or \n\nwithout swimming practice in the elementary school of that area, with the objective to get \n\nfrom them the data to analyze the context of swimming practice and the factors related with \n\nteaching of swimming in the elementary school. The questionnaire was elaborated following \n\nWilkinson and Birmingham\u2019s recommendations (2003). The majority of the questions included \n\nin this questionnaire are dichotomous questions (so, closed questions), based on Rasch\u2019s model \n\n(1960) decreasing order of concordance, or even of the Likert\u2019s type, with four levels of \n\nattribution. The final version of the questionnaire has included the following topics: (i) \n\ncharacterization of the respondents (gender, age, academic degree, professional experience, \n\nnumber of teaching hours in the elementary school); (ii) characterization of the swimming \n\nlearning environment (water temperature, water depth, number of classes, weekly frequency); \n\n(iii) local learn-to-swim framework in the elementary school (if swimming exists or not in the \n\nelementary school; understanding the swimming practice guidelines from the Ministry of \n\nEducation; the number of lessons of the swimming practice; the reason behind the decision of \n\nschools that have decided to remove swimming practice from their educational program) \u2013 \n\nannex 1. \n\nIn parallel, the swimming teachers at elementary schools answered to a questionnaire with the \n\nfollowing topics: (i) characterization of the respondents (gender, age, academic degree, \n\nprofessional experience); (ii) objectives of the swimming practice in the elementary school; \n\n(iii) the context of the swimming practice in the elementary school\u2019s education program and \n\nthe understanding of the swimming practice guidelines from the Ministry of Education; (iv) \n\nmethodology of swimming practice in the elementary school (objectives, use of didactic \n\nmaterial, didactic content application, importance of basic learning acquisition by students, \n\napplication of these contents in the global learning of aquatic competences and formal \n\nstrokes/techniques) \u2013 annex 2. \n\nBoth questionnaires were adapted from Costa et al. (2012). We have used a control group in \n\nfour different municipalities not included in the study\u2019s sample, with the objective to have, \n\nlater on, a higher clearness and objectiveness of the questions included in those questionnaires. \n\nThe questionnaires were also reviewed by experts in swimming teaching.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n2.4.4 Analysis of statistics \n\nIn order to describe and summarize the data collected in this study, we used the descriptive \n\nstatistic, in particular the calculation of frequencies. \n\n \n\n2.5 Results \n\n2.5.1 General characteristics of respondents  \n\nThe following tables present the percentage of gender, age and academic degree of the \n\ninquired pedagogical coordinators and swimming teachers.  \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\nPercentage of gender, age and academic degree of the inquired swimming pool pedagogical \n\ncoordinators and swimming teachers \n\nTable 1a) \n\nCharacteristics of the inquired swimming pool pedagogical coordinators with swimming practice \n\nincluded in the elementary school of their area \n\n Count % \n\nGender Male 45 76.3 \n\nFemale 14 23.7 \n\nAge 20-25 0 0.0 \n\n26-30 11 18.6 \n\n31-35 19 32.2 \n\n35+ 29 49.2 \n\nAcademic degree Secondary school 2 3.4 \n\nBachelor degree 2 3.4 \n\nGraduation degree 42 71.2 \n\nMaster's degree 9 15.3 \n\nPhD 1 1.7 \n\nOther 3 5.1 \n\n \n\nTable 1b) \n\nCharacteristics of the inquired swimming pool pedagogical coordinators without swimming practice \n\nincluded in the elementary school of their area \n\n Count % \n\nGender Male 25 83.3 \n\nFemale 5 16.7 \n\nAge 20-25 1 3.3 \n\n26-30 7 23.3 \n\n31-35 11 36.7 \n\n35+ 11 36.7 \n\nAcademic degree Secondary school 1 3.3 \n\nBachelor Degree 0 0.0 \n\nGraduation degree 23 76.7 \n\nMaster's degree 6 20.0 \n\nPhD 0 0.0 \n\nOther 0 0.0 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\nTable 1c) \n\nCharacteristics of the inquired swimming teachers at elementary school  \n\n Count  % \n\nGender Male 65 65.0 \n\nFemale 35 35.0 \n\nAge 20-25 7 7.0 \n\n26-30 37 37.0 \n\n31-35 35 35.0 \n\n35+ 21 21.0 \n\nAcademic degree Secondary school 3 3.0 \n\nBachelor Degree 2 2.0 \n\nGraduation degree 81 81.0 \n\nMaster's degree 12 12.0 \n\nPhD 0 0.0 \n\nOther 2 2.0 \n\n \n\nThe data above demonstrates a significant dissimilarity of gender at the management level, in \n\nparticular at the pedagogical coordination level. About 50% of the pedagogical coordinators \n\nhave 35 years old or more and almost all of them are graduated.   \n\nMost of the inquired teachers have two or three years of professional experience (85%), teaching \n\nbetween six to ten hours of swimming practice in the elementary school (44%) and have a \n\ndiverse weekly distribution of teaching hours: one to five hours a week (20%), six to ten hours \n\na week (44%), 11 to 15 hours a week (22%). \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Organization of swimming schools \n\nAccording to the answers from the 89 pedagogical coordinators inquired, the water temperature \n\nin the context of swimming practice in the elementary school ranges from 28\u00baC to 31\u00baC. No \n\nschool is using only deep water pools. 73% of inquired schools use both deep and shallow water \n\npools and 27% use only shallow water pools.  \n\n55% of the inquired elementary schools have swimming practice included on their educational \n\nprogram and 36.7% have not. The number of practice sessions in the elementary school ranges \n\nfrom nine to 16 sessions, during the school year. Classes have 13 to 16 students, with one \n\npractice session per week in most cases (64.4%). Most of the municipalities have between one \n\nand 15 elementary schools with swimming practice, especially in the third and fourth years. No \n\nclass in the first year and about 20% in the second year. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Context of swimming practice in the elementary school \n\nThe following table shows the percentage of inquired schools with ongoing swimming practice \n\nand with previously swimming practice in the elementary school of their area (currently \n\nclosed). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\nTable 2 \n\nPercentage of inquired schools with ongoing swimming practice and swimming practice \n\ncurrently closed \n\nSwimming \n\npractice in the \n\nelementary \n\nschool \n\nSwimming schools with ongoing \n\nswimming practice in the elementary \n\nschool of their area \n\nSwimming schools with previously \n\nswimming practice in the elementary \n\nschool of their area (currently closed) \n\nCount % Count % \n\nAEP (*)  43 72.9 3 10.0 \n\nElementary \n\nschool  \n\n12 20.3 4 13.3 \n\nOthers 4 6.8 14 70.0 \n\nNever included - - 9 6.7 \n\n(*) AEP \u2013 Extracurricular Activities Program, swimming practice as additional educational activity, in the \nelementary school. \n\n \n\nAccording to table 2, swimming practice is essentially seen as an extra/complementary activity \n\nin about 73% of inquired schools. In those municipalities where swimming practice is now out \n\nof elementary school\u2019s program, the swimming practice was provided by the municipality as \n\nextra school activity. In only a few cases, swimming practice was included in the Extracurricular \n\nActivities Program activities or was part of the elementary school\u2019s program.

Less attention is given (\u201csometimes\u201d column) \n\nto \u201cimmersion in deep water\u201d (59%) and body rotations (61% sometimes, 13% rarely). \n\nIn respect to teaching official strokes/techniques, the most important points to the inquired \n\nswimming teachers (\u201calways considered\u201d) are the following: \u201cwater entry\u201d (60%), \u201cdynamic \n\nbalance\u201d (82%), \u201ccorrect propulsion with legs\u201d (74%) and \u201cspecific technical skills\u201d (74%). On \n\nthe other hand, results suggest that the following points are less important to these swimming \n\nteachers (\u201conly sometimes\u201d): \u201csymmetric rotations\u201d (62%), \u201ccorrect propulsion with arms\u201d \n\n(63%) and \u201crhythmic breathing control\u201d (53%). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\nTable 9 \n\nOpinion of the inquired swimming teachers about the use of pedagogic contents during the \n\nteaching-learning process of swimming \n\nTopic Teachers \n\nAlways Sometimes Rarely Never \n\nCount % Count % Count % Count % \n\nT\ne\na\nc\nh\nin\n\ng\n a\n\nd\na\np\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n t\n\no\n w\n\na\nte\n\nr \n\ne\nn\nv\nir\n\no\nn\nm\n\ne\nn\nt \n\n \n\nWater entry 72 72.0 25 25.0 3 3.0 0 0.0 \n\nTasks to acquire confident  90 90.0 10 10.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 \n\nSubmersion in apnea 46 46.0 43 43.0 10 10.0 1 1.0 \n\nBalance 70 70.0 29 29.0 1 1.0 0 0.0 \n\nPropulsion with legs 69 69.0 28 28.0 3 3.0 0 0.0 \n\nPropulsion with legs and arms 34 34.0 57 57.0 8 8.0 1 1.0 \n\nGlides  50 50.0 43 43.0 7 7.0 0 0.0 \n\nRotations 24 24.0 61 61.0 13 13.0 2 2.0 \n\nSkills 58 58.0 37 37.0 5 5.0 0 0.0 \n\nDiving 28 28.0 64 64.0 8 8.0 0 0.0 \n\nBreathing control 86 86.0 14 14.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 \n\nDeep water immersion  20 20.0 59 59.0 18 18.0 3 3.0 \n\nT\ne\na\nc\nh\nin\n\ng\n b\n\na\nsi\n\nc\n s\n\ntr\no\nk\ne\n \n\nte\nc\nh\nn\niq\n\nu\ne\n  \n\nWater entry 60 60.0 29 29.0 10 10.0 1 1.0 \n\nDynamic balance 82 82.0 16 16.0 2 2.0 0 0.0 \n\nCorrect propulsion with legs 74 74.0 24 24.0 2 2.0 0 0.0 \n\nSymmetric rotations 30 30.0 62 62.0 6 6.0 2 2.0 \n\nCorrect propulsion with arms 24 24.0 63 63.0 12 12.0 1 1.0 \n\nSpecific technical skills 74 74.0 23 23.0 2 2.0 1 1.0 \n\nRhythmic breathing control 39 39.0 53 53.0 8 8.0 0 0.0 \n\nStarts and turns 39 39.0 47 47.0 10 10.0 4 4.0 \n\nComplex skills 7 7.0 33 33.0 47 47.0 13 13.0 \n\n \n\nTable 10 shows the opinion of the inquired swimming teachers about the importance given to \n\nattitude and basic understanding during swimming learning.  \n\nThe results shown below indicates that, in general, all listed attitudes are important to the \n\ninquired teachers.

As we \n\ndiscuss below, the obtained results demonstrate that swimming practice is included essentially \n\non the extracurricular plan of the third and fourth school years/levels, with focus on the basic \n\naquatic skills, in line with the orientations given by the Portuguese Ministry of Education.  \n\nIn parallel, we have identified the causes of the inexistence of swimming practice in certain \n\neducational contexts and also some difficulties in putting it in the right position, probably \n\nbecause of some limitations of the efficiency of the teaching-learning process of swimming, in \n\nrespect to learn more complex aquatic/swimming skills.  \n\nWith regards to the profile of the inquired pedagogical coordinator and swimming teachers, we \n\nsee that the majority of them holds an academic degree on this specific field, probably due to \n\nthe fact that swimming practice is included, in most cases, in the Extracurricular Activities \n\nProgram (extra or complementary school activities) \u2013 which represents about 73% on our study, \n\nwhich requires professionals of physical activities and sports to have a specific qualification to \n\nbe entitled to teach the Physical Education discipline in the elementary school and/or holding \n\na degree in Sport Sciences. In the study by Brand\u00e3o (2010), all the teachers that have \n\nparticipated on the study hold a degree in Sport and Physical Education as well. However, not \n\nall the teachers working on the Extracurricular Activities Program are familiar with the \n\nguidelines and objectives defined by the Ministry of Education (Brand\u00e3o, 2010). We realized \n\nthat the percentage of men in this professional activity is much higher than women, in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n\nparticular in the management positions (pedagogical coordinator). This proportion is certainly \n\nsimilar to the percentage of men and women with a degree in physical education and sports, \n\nin Portugal, although the rate between men and women becomes higher as we go up on the \n\nposition level (from swimming teacher to pedagogical coordinator). \n\nWith respect to the organization of swimming schools, we found that swimming practice is more \n\nfrequent to find on the third and fourth year/level, in the elementary school. This happens \n\nprobably because the guidelines of the educational programming (Maria &amp; Nunes, 2006) only \n\nconsider swimming practice in those years/levels.  \n\nTeaching conditions appear to be globally appropriate for the purposes of the aquatic activity \n\nprogram. According to Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campani\u00e7o (1989), the main factors \n\nare the following ones: the number of student (important for the teaching\u2019s effectiveness and \n\nquality); the didactic material used (allows a wide range of activities during swimming lessons); \n\nthe water temperature (shall be around 30\u00baC to 32\u00baC); and the pool depth (mostly shallow \n\nwater). In fact, we found that in 40% of swimming pools the water temperature is around \n\n28/29\u00baC. Although Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campani\u00e7o (1989) indicate that the water \n\ntemperature should be between 30\u00baC to 32\u00baC, the Quality National Council recommends a \n\nmaximum water temperature of 30\u00baC. The swimming pools owned by the Portuguese \n\nmunicipalities seem to follow that recommendation. With regards to pool depth, none of the \n\nschools included in this study is using only deep water. About 73% of them are using both deep \n\nand shallow water, simultaneously. In fact, and according to Costa et al. (2012), the decision \n\nof combining aquatic activities in both types of depth can be an added value and an appropriate \n\noption for the objective of the adaptation to aquatic environment at these ages. We couldn't \n\nfigure out if the few schools (only 27%) that teach swimming only in shallow water are doing it \n\nbecause it was a management decision, or because they cannot access or build a swimming \n\npool with both kind of depths.  \n\nThe number of students per class (between 13 to 16 students) and the low frequency of \n\nswimming lessons per week (the majority of cases studied are having one lesson per week) seem \n\nto be a less positive point found with this study. Both facts result in a lower quality and \n\neffectiveness of the swimming learning/teaching (Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995). According to \n\nSarmento, Carvalho, Florindo and Raposo (1982), the process of acquiring skills in the aquatic \n\nenvironment depends on the use of appropriate instruments and methods. Therefore, the size \n\nof classes seems to have a relevant impact in the effectiveness of the swimming teaching, \n\nespecially during the initial phase of adaptation to water and acquisition of basic swimming \n\nskills (Campani\u00e7o, 1991). According to that, Santos, Gon\u00e7alves and Pereira (1994) found that \n\nlarge classes (about 20 students per class), in a certain school, were having a negative impact \n\nin the success of swimming learning, comparing with two other schools with smaller classes \n\n(around 11 to 13 students per class). According to Carvalho (1994), the learning progress of the \n\nclass has a direct impact from its size, independently of the qualification and experience of the \n\nteacher. In the long run, this brings a negative impact to the teaching quality. This author \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\nhighlights that deep water, i.e. where the student\u2019s foot cannot touch the bottom of the pool, \n\nrequires the teacher to provide a direct support to students. He also says that, because of \n\neffectiveness and safety, the maximum of students per teacher should be no more than four \n\nand this is the most recommended option during the phase of adaptation to water in deep \n\nswimming pools. \n\nThe cause of the absence of swimming practice in the elementary school of 30 municipalities \n\nincluded in this study seems be budgetary constraints (60% of municipalities). Another difficulty \n\nfound is the transportation of students to and from the swimming facilities. In our point of \n\nview, the absence of swimming practice during the childhood may create two problems. The \n\nfirst problem is about the lower development of motor skills, during the childhood, particularly \n\nthe aquatic skills, that are key for a healthy cognitive, affective and psychomotor stimulation \n\n(Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995). This is especially important between the end of the preschool \n\nand the beginning of the elementary school (Blanksby et al., 1995; Courage, Reynolds, &amp; \n\nRichards, 2006; Zhao et al., 2005). The second problem is the potential risk of drowning \n\n(Brenner, et al., 2009, Peden &amp; McGee, 2003). \n\nDuring this study, we have noticed that the guidelines from the Ministry of Education are \n\nglobally known and followed by swimming teachers (87%). The other teachers follow other \n\nprogram. In the majority of studied swimming schools, the swimming teaching follows a \n\nstandard didactic unit, where the swimming teacher has to strictly follow the standard \n\nprogram/guidelines. In fact, only 39% of swimming teachers are involved in the definition and \n\nsupervision of this didactic unit. \n\nAccording to our results, the two groups that participated in the survey (pedagogical \n\ncoordinators and swimming teachers) consider to be positive to acquire basic aquatic skills in \n\nthe elementary school and eventually to start learning basic stroke techniques, particularly \n\nfront crawl and backstroke. It is also important to consider the statistics about the procedures \n\nand class organization (safety rules, rescue, games and fun activities). These topics are always \n\ntaken into account, although with a lower level of importance.  \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Organization of swimming pools included on this study \n\nOne of the objectives of this study is to describe the methodology of swimming teaching for \n\nthe elementary school. Swimming lessons are related to the adaptation to water and to the \n\nteaching with little didactic material. Based on the six objectives considered in this study, the \n\nresult of the inquiries is in line with the study by Costa et al. (2012) and by Campani\u00e7o (1991), \n\nespecially in respect to the adaptation to water, mainly in shallow water, during an initial \n\nphase. The pleasure and autonomy in the water are key aspects for the development of basic \n\naquatic skills (Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995; Langendorfer, 2010). In fact, swimming practice in \n\nthe elementary school contributes to the motor development and stimulates the practice of \n\nphysical activities, specially swimming.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\nWith this study, we found a very low usage of didactic material. Boards are the most used \n\nequipment, as also reported by Costa et al. (2012). As far as we know, there are very little \n\nscientific studies about the impact of using devices (didactic material) in aquatic readiness \n\nprograms. Erbaugh (1986), one of those scarce studies, demonstrated how important is to use \n\nthis equipment during the development of horizontal dynamic body balance (glides). However, \n\nmore important is to understand the educational advantages of didactic equipment. For \n\nexample, the fun when using such devices, associated with a certain teaching methodology that \n\nassumes the game in the water as a natural educational resource, which encompasses both the \n\npractitioner\u2019s motivation and the pedagogical effectiveness, also known as compressive method \n\nby Moreno and Guiti\u00e9rrez (1998).  \n\nA few inquired teachers (even though they represent a small number) are worried with the use \n\nof arm floats. The excessive use of floating equipment (jackets and arm float) in the \n\ndevelopment of floating capability, or even body behavior in a dynamic situation, has been \n\ncriticized by several authors (Barbosa, 2004; Blanksby et al., 1995; Costa et al., 2012; \n\nLangendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995; Soares, 2000). There are distinct opinions about using auxiliary \n\nmaterial in swimming learning. Some authors discourage the use of floating equipment (Catteau \n\n&amp; Garrof, 1988) due to its negative influence in floating and propulsion. Other authors consider \n\nthat auxiliary equipment should only be used on moderated way (Barbosa, 2004; Langendorfer \n\n&amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno &amp; Sanmartin, 1998; Navarro, 1995; Sarmento &amp; Montenegro, 1992; \n\nSoares, 2000), avoiding the dependency of practitioners from a false perception of autonomy \n\nin the water, which develops an artificial aquatic competence, as a consequence of such \n\n(Soares, 2000). Nevertheless, the use of auxiliary equipment, according to Navarro (1995), \n\nincreases safety sense, reduces tiredness and, therefore, the swimming practice can be more \n\nmotivating. \n\n \n\n2.6.3 Methodology of swimming teaching in the elementary school \n\nIn the context of adaptation to water environment, the following points were found as key \n\naspects in the teaching methodology: entry in the water, tasks that help increasing confidence \n\nin the water, body balance and breathing control. These results seem to be in line with the \n\nopinion about the purpose of swimming practice during the elementary school (see table 7 \n\nabove). In fact, the pleasure of practicing such activity and the feeling of having no fear in \n\nwater are key aspects for the inquired teachers. However, the fact that the inquired teachers \n\nhave demonstrated they consider less important the body rotations in different axis (61% of \n\nanswers are \u201csometimes\u201d and 13% are \u201crarely\u201d) seems to us to be inappropriate and not \n\ncompliant with the opinion of several authors and publications in the domain of swimming, like \n\nfor instance Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Barbosa and Queir\u00f3s (2004), towards a good \n\nand complete acquisition of aquatic skills. In fact, several authors agree that the body rotation \n\nis an important target to learn more complex skills later on, like swimming strokes, starts and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\nturns (Barbosa &amp; Queir\u00f3s, 2004; Erbaugh, 1978; Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995;). The less \n\nimportance given to rotations was also detected by Costa et al. (2012), in a similar study\u2019s \n\nsample.  \n\nWith respect to the importance of content for the teaching of formal techniques/strokes, we \n\ncan see that the most important topics for the inquired swimming teachers are the following: \n\n\u201cwater entry\u201d, \u201cdynamic balance\u201d, \u201ccorrect propulsion with legs\u201d and \u201cother specific technical \n\nskills\u201d. As with the adaptation to water environment, the \u201csymmetric body rotations\u201d are \n\nconsider to be less important skills. According to the inquired teachers, also less important are \n\nthe \u201cpropulsion with arms\u201d, the \u201crhythmic control of breathing\u201d, \u201cstarts and turns\u201d and other \n\n\u201ccomplex skills\u201d. Unfortunately, with this study we cannot determinate if the importance level \n\ngiven to each topic, during the teaching of swimming, has brought a positive or negative impact \n\nto the learning of the skill.  \n\n \n\n2.7 Conclusion \n\nThe results of this study indicate that the swimming practice, in the elementary school in \n\nPortugal, preferably follows the guidelines from the Ministry of Education. The absence of \n\nswimming practice in the school program of certain municipalities seems to be caused by \n\nbudgetary and transportation restrictions. The methodology and supervision of swimming \n\nlessons are mainly accomplished by swimming school pedagogical coordinators. The application \n\nof defined aquatic programs are found, almost exclusively, in the third and fourth school \n\nyears/levels, with only a session per week and organized in classes with inadequate size, \n\nconsidering the level of aquatic skills of students. Swimming education seems to be focused on \n\nthe pleasure part of swimming practice, trying to make kids confidant with the water \n\nenvironment, drawing more attention to the acquisition of basic aquatic skills, such as the \n\nwater entry, the body balance and the breathing control, with little use of didactic equipment.  \n\nWe recommend that futures studies should try to clarify the impact of certain topics related to \n\nteaching methodology, like class size, number of sessions per week, the teaching approach or \n\neven the use of auxiliary/didactic equipment, on the success of swimming education. It would \n\nbe also very important to know the impact of swimming practice on the global motor \n\ndevelopment of children, besides its importance in the context of child safety.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter was published on a scientific journal: Rocha, H.

Twenty-one Portuguese school-aged children of both genders (4.70 \u00b1 0.51 yr), \n\ninexperienced in aquatic programs, and participated in this study. The children were divided \n\ninto two groups performing a similar aquatic program but on a different water depth: shallow \n\nwater (n=10) and deep water (n=11). Each participant was evaluated twice for their aquatic \n\nreadiness using an observation check list of 17 aquatic motor skills: during the first session (T0) \n\nand after six months of practice (two sessions per week - 48 sessions) (T1). The aquatic \n\nproficiency on each skill was compared between the groups and a stepwise discriminant analysis \n\nwas conducted to predict the conditions with higher or lower aquatic competence. Results \n\nsuggested that swimming practice contributed positively to improvements on several basic \n\naquatic skills, in both groups. Though, the results showed that shallow water group managed \n\nto acquire a higher degree of aquatic competence particularly in five basic aquatic skills \n\n(p<0.05): breath control - face immersion and eye opening; horizontal buoyancy; body position \n\nat ventral gliding; body position at dorsal gliding; leg kick with breath control at ventral body \n\nposition, without any flutter device. The discriminant function revealed a significant \n\nassociation between both groups and four included factors (aquatic skills) (p<0.001), accounting \n\nfor (0.938)^2=88% between group variability. The body position at ventral gliding was the main \n\nrelevant predictor (r=0.535). In conclusion, our results suggested that shallow water swimming \n\nlessons seemed to allow greater aquatic competence in preschool children after a period of six \n\nmonths of practice. \n\nKeywords: swimming, children, aquatic skills, shallow water, deep water \n\n \n\n3.3 Introduction \n\nSwimming is not considered a static personal ability (Langendorfer, 2014); instead, it implies \n\nan acquisition process, through practice and experience, which is built on a previous state of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n56 \n\nautonomy, confidence and satisfaction in the aquatic environment. Hence, aquatic competence \n\nis considered a bio-behavioral assumption of learning more complex and specialized aquatic \n\nskills, which also includes swimming strokes (Parker &amp; Blanksby, 1997; Warda, 2003).  \n\nThis conceptual understanding of aquatic competence is perhaps the most important in recent \n\ndecades with regard to swimming learning (Barbosa &amp; Queir\u00f3s, 2004; Barbosa et al., 2010; \n\nBarbosa et al., 2013; Langerdorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno et al., 1998). It provided a coherent \n\npedagogical foundation to reshape the \"thinking processes of teachers\u201d and therefore on what \n\nis tough and how is tough (Clark &amp; Peterson, 1986). However, there are still several pedagogical \n\nissues unanswered mainly related with the process of swimming teaching and its results.  \n\nThe uniqueness of the practice environment makes swimming a challenge for initiation of a \n\nconstructive approach to teaching (Light &amp; Wallian, 2008). Although constructivism is not a \n\nprescription for teaching (Fosnot, 1996), it is necessary to consider the teacher\u2019s role to provide \n\noptimal opportunities for learning. Therefore, proper environment conditions in a swimming \n\npool can be particular crucial to learning with effectiveness (Carvalho, 1994). One determinant \n\nfactor seems to be the variation of the water depth (Costa et al., 2012). Indeed, aquatic \n\nreadiness programs for young children can be performed in shallow water (usually from 0.65 to \n\n1.00 meter deep), usually in the beginning of the process, or in deep water (usually from 1.00 \n\nmeter to 2.00 meters deep), in the later stages. By decision of the swimming instructor or mere \n\nlack of structural alternatively, there are aquatic programs for children (for utilitarian or formal \n\neducational purposes) almost exclusively conducted in deep water. One of the few studies on \n\nthis subject compared the deep and shallow water effect on developing preschooler\u2019s aquatic \n\nskills, after six, twelve and eighteen months of practice (Costa et al., 2012). Results suggested \n\nthat water depth might affect the purchase of some basic aquatic skills, at least up to six \n\nmonths of practice. However, that was a cross-sectional study, observational, which does not \n\nprovide definitive information on the cause-effect of the conditions compared. \n\nTherefore, the purpose of our study was to analyze the differences on developing preschooler\u2019s \n\naquatic skills between deep and shallow water aquatic programs after six months of practice. \n\nIt is known that the shallow water program (while applying a controlled methodological \n\napproach) may induce an acquisition of basic aquatic skills at a higher level of proficiency. \n\n \n\n3.4 Methods \n\n3.4.1 Study sample \n\nThe study sample consisted on 21 Portuguese elementary school-aged children of both genders \n\n(4.70 \u00b1 0.51 yr) with no previous experience in aquatic programs. The children were divided \n\ninto two distinct classes with a similar aquatic program but performed on a different water \n\ndepth environment: ten and 11 children performed all the swimming lessons in shallow water \n\nand deep water, respectively.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n57 \n\nThe local swimming school board and the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Faculty of \n\nthe University of Beira Interior approved the experimental procedures, ensuring compliance \n\nwith the declaration of Helsinki. The children's parents were informed about the study design \n\nand procedures and a written informed consent was signed. Data confidentiality was \n\nguaranteed, as well as their anonymity during the treatment process and analysis. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Aquatic readiness assessment \n\nAll children were evaluated twice for their aquatic readiness using an observation checklist of \n\n17 aquatic motor skills based on Langerdorfer and Bruya (1995) and already applied by Costa \n\net al. (2012): during the first session (T0) and after six months of practice (two sessions per \n\nweek: 48 sessions; T1). The aquatic motor skills assessed were the following: water entry (Sk1); \n\nwater orientation and adjustment at vertical position (Sk2); breath control - immersion of the \n\nface and eye opening (Sk3) ; horizontal buoyancy (Sk4); body position at ventral gliding (Sk5); \n\nbody position at dorsal gliding (Sk6); body position at longitudinal rotation in gliding (Sk7); body \n\nposition at front and back somersaults (Sk8); leg kick with breath control at ventral body \n\nposition, with flutter boards (Sk9); and without any flutter device, (Sk10); leg kick with breath \n\ncontrol at dorsal body position with flutter boards (Sk11); and without any flutter device (Sk12); \n\nfeet-first entry (Sk13); head-first entry (Sk14); Autonomous in deep pool (legs and arms \n\ndisplacement) (Sk15); vertical buoyancy at deep water (Sk16); deep water immersion (Sk17). \n\nEach one of these skills was divided into increasing levels of complexity (three, four or five \n\nlevels, depending on the categorical skill) as suggested by Langendorfer and Bruya (1995): \n\nenable to perform at stage one, rudimentary movements at stage two (or three) and \n\nfundamental movements at stage three (or even four or five) that precede the specific motor \n\nskill acquisition. The children had three attempts to achieve the proposed exercises, as \n\nconducted by Costa et al. (2012). \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Swimming practice \n\n At the beginning of the study all children were in a state of total inaptness to the aquatic \n\nenvironment. The swimming sessions took place at the same time of the day, twice a week, \n\nwith 45 min duration (between 6h45 and 7h30 pm). The shallow water sessions were carried \n\nout in a 0.70 cm water depth, with the water temperature at 31 \u00baC, the air temperature at 29 \n\n\u00baC and a relative humidity of 65%. The deep water sessions occurred in a 1.30 meter water \n\ndepth, with a water temperature of temperature 29\u00baC, air temperature of 29\u00b0C and a relative \n\nhumidity was 65%.  \n\nBoth aquatic programs aimed to improve children\u2019s aquatic readiness by teaching basic aquatic \n\nskills. The number of students in each class was reduced to increase the useful time of the \n\nlesson and minimize practice waiting time among students. The swimming teacher was the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n\nsame in both groups. Therefore, the teaching methods and the skills developed in each class \n\nwere similar and based on the literature guidelines (e.g., Langendorfer and Bruya, 1995 and \n\nCanossa et al. 2007). \n\nTable 11 shows how the aquatic skills were sequenced over the six months of teaching. \n\nTable 11 \n\nAquatic program characteristics conducted in both water deep environment.  \n\nMonth 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 \n\nSk1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk4 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk5 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk6 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk7     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk8         ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk9           ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk10   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk11           ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk12   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk13 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk14     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk15*   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk16* ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nSk17*         ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nLegend: , Aquatic skill not developed; ?, Aquatic skill highly developed; ?, Aquatic skill moderately \ndeveloped; ?, Aquatic skill not directly development but consider pre-requisite.  \n\nWater entry (Sk1); water orientation and adjustment at vertical position (Sk2); breath control - immersion \nof the face and eye opening (Sk3) ; horizontal buoyancy (Sk4); body position at ventral gliding (Sk5); body \nposition at dorsal gliding (Sk6); body position at longitudinal rotation in gliding (Sk7); body position at \nfront and back somersaults (Sk8); leg kick with breath control at ventral body position, with flutter boards \n(Sk9); and without any flutter device, (Sk10); leg kick with breath control at dorsal body position with \nflutter boards (Sk11); and without any flutter device (Sk12); feet-first entry (Sk13); head-first entry \n(Sk14); Autonomous in deep pool (legs and arms displacement) (Sk15); vertical buoyancy at deep water \n(Sk16); deep water immersion (Sk17). \n\n \n\nTeaching style shifted from absolute control (command and task style) to more indirect \n\nteaching style, best known as guided discovery (Mosston and Ashworth, 1990). Indeed, the \n\nstudents mostly performed analytical tasks to development basic aquatics skills in both aquatic \n\nenvironments. However, ludic tasks were also included, leading the child to discover a \n\npredetermined \u201caquatic motor target\u201d in response to a sequence of problems presented by the \n\nteacher. Sometimes it was necessary to adjust certain aquatic tasks due to physical \n\nembarrassment imposed by depth. As such, we had to make minor changes to the task \n\norganization (i.e., smaller groups and slight changes to certain rules of play) and use some \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n59 \n\nfloating didactic material. The following didactic and floating material was used: didactic - \n\npuzzles, towers, slides, mattresses, overflow arches, rings; floating - arches, balls, small boards \n\nand noodles. \n\n \n\n3.4.4 Statistical analysis \n\nStandard statistical methods were used for the calculation of means and standard deviations. \n\nThe t test was used to compare the differences in aquatic proficiency (on each skill) between \n\ngroups. The effect size was calculated using Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988). A stepwise discriminant \n\nanalysis was also conducted with ? wilk\u2019s method to build a predictive model for group \n\nmembership (aquatic competence for shallow and deep water students). Predictor variables \n\nwere the 17 aquatic motor skills previously described. Box's M variance-covariance matrices \n\nwere used to test the multivariate homogeneity. The level of statistical significance was set at \n\np ? 0.05. \n\n \n\n3.5 Results \n\nTable 12 presents the aquatic skills acquired by shallow water and deep water students during \n\nsix months of practice.  \n\nAt the beginning of this study (T0), no differences were found in aquatic readiness between \n\nshallow and deep water. The students were not adapted to the aquatic environment and their \n\naquatic motor proficiency was zero in all aquatic skills. After six months of practice there were \n\ndifferences between the means of both groups in five aquatic skills: Sk3, Sk4, Sk5 Sk6 and Sk10.  \n\nThe stepwise discriminant analysis was used to determine which aquatic skills discriminate \n\nbetween both groups after six months of practice. The step-by-step model of discrimination \n\nwas built with four steps, including the following aquatic skills: Sk5 (F=40.151, p<0.001); Sk16 \n\n(F=34.254, p<0.001); Sk15 (F=29.237, p<0.001) and Sk13 (F=29.489, p<0.001). The canonical \n\ndiscriminant function analysis revealed a significant association between both groups and all \n\nincluded factors, accounting for (0.938)^2=88% between group variability (?=0.119, \n\nQui^2=36.124, p<0.001).  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nTable 12 \n\nAquatic skills acquired (mean \u00b1 SD) by shallow-water and deep-water students after 6 months \n\nof practice \n\nSkill \nLevels of \n\ncomplexity \n\nT0 (baseline) T1 (six months pratice) \n\nShallow \n\nWater \n\n(n=11) \n\nDeep \n\nWater \n\n(n=10) \n\nP-value \nCohen\u2019s  \n\nd \n\nShallow \n\nWater \n\n(n=11) \n\nDeep \n\nWater \n\n(n=10) \n\nP-value \nCohen\u2019s  \n\nd \n\nSk1 1 to 3 1.091\u00b1.302 1.100\u00b1.316 .947 .029 3.000\u00b10.000 2.900\u00b1.316 .306 .448 \n\nSk2 1 to 3 1.273\u00b1.467 1.000\u00b1.000 .081 .827 3.000\u00b10.000 0.000\u00b1.000 - - \n\nSk3 1 to 5 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1000 - - 4.189\u00b1.879 3.100\u00b1.137 .042* 1.73 \n\nSk4 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 2.636\u00b1.120 1.500\u00b1.850 .018* 1.87 \n\nSk5 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 2.727\u00b1.647 1.200\u00b1.422 .000* 2.79 \n\nSk6 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000+.000 - - 2.090\u00b1.831 1.100\u00b1.316 .002* 1.57 \n\nSk7 1 to 3 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.455\u00b1.522 1.300\u00b1.483 .491 .308 \n\nSk8 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - \n\nSk9 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 2.455\u00b1522 2.100\u00b1.316 .079 .823 \n\nSk10 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000+.000 - - 2.000\u00b1.632 1.400\u00b1.516 .029* 1.04 \n\nSk11 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 2.091\u00b1.701 1.700\u00b1.675 .209 .568 \n\nSk12 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.818\u00b1.874 1.200\u00b1.422 .057 .900 \n\nSk13 1 to 3 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 2.364\u00b1.505 1.800\u00b1.789 .064 .851 \n\nSk14 1 to 3 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.727\u00b1.467 1.300\u00b1.675 .105 .736 \n\nSk15 1 to 3 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.364\u00b1.505 1.500\u00b1.527 .552 .264 \n\nSk16 1 to 5 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.364\u00b1.505 1.700\u00b1.483 .136 .680 \n\nSk17 1 to 4 1.000\u00b1.000 1.000\u00b1.000 - - 1.182\u00b1.405 1.300\u00b1.483 .549 .265 \n\n \n\nTable 13 shows the pooled within-groups correlations between discriminating variables and \n\nstandardized canonical discriminant functions.  \n\nThe variables are ordered by absolute size of correlation within function; Sk5 is the main \n\npredictor with a relevant absolute size of correlation within function (r=0.535).

Results showed positive effects of swimming practice in children\u2019s aquatic \n\ncompetence from both sessions\u2019 types. However, shallow water students managed to acquire \n\ngreater aquatic competence in nearly all aquatic skills measured after six months of practice.  \n\nThe swimming programs were more than just the simple acquisition of new motor patterns that \n\nallow moving inside the aquatic environment (Langendorfer &amp; Bruya, 1995; Martins et al., \n\n2010). These are based on the need to adjust the motor behavior of the child in the water, \n\nhelping to understand the particularities of the aquatic environment, specifically the lower \n\ngravity and viscosity (Barbosa &amp; Queir\u00f3s, 2004; Holm\u00e9r, 1974). Therefore, the enjoyment for \n\nswimming practice is associated with the notion of trust about their own security in the new \n\nenvironment (Brenner, Saluja &amp; Smith, 2003; Velasco, 1994).  \n\nIn the initial phase, the confidence of the child in the aquatic environment could be easily \n\naffected when, for instance, the water depth of exercitation is changed. This constrain caused \n\nby the depth of the pool could influence their autonomy. The current study didn\u2019t have the \n\npurpose to study the variability of the pedagogic intervention or of the student\u00b4s motor \n\nbehavior in both pool environments (see Costa et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it is our perception \n\nthat the water depth seems to be an inhibitory factor to discover the aquatic environment and \n\nit\u00b4s particularities. Thus, the water depth could condition the students\u2019 creativity in the \n\nresolution of major motor problems caused by the aquatic environment, at least in the early \n\nstages of familiarization. Although our effort to provide identical pedagogic experiences in both \n\nenvironments, for safety reasons it is understandable that teaching in deep water could be less \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\nstudent-centered. There is a need to adapt the swimming tasks due to the mandatory use of \n\nfloat materials and the lack of confidence of the student. Therefore, the teaching methods in \n\nthis condition tended to be more traditional (Mosston, 1992). This occurs at least in the initial \n\nphase of development, in which the students\u2019 actions are always derived from the teacher \n\ndecisions (Quina, 2009). Considering a complete understanding of the concept of aquatic \n\ncompetence, it is not imperative that there is only one response to similar situations (Moreno \n\n&amp; Guiti\u00e9rrez 1998; Moreno &amp; Murcia, 1998). Thus, we believe that different water depths during \n\nswimming lessons inevitably provide different psychomotor experiences. Our results, as we \n\ndiscuss below, seem to support such reasoning.  \n\nAs reported in table 12, those children who attended to shallow water lessons presented greater \n\nlevel of aquatic competence in several skills, namely: breath control - immersion of the face \n\nand eye opening (Sk3), horizontal buoyancy (Sk4), body position at ventral gliding (Sk5), body \n\nposition at dorsal gliding (SK6), and leg kick with breath control at ventral body position, \n\nwithout any flutter device (Sk10). These results are consistent with the data reported by Costa \n\net al. (2012); although these authors reported differences between both session types after six \n\nmonths of practices also in the following skills: water entry (Sk1); body position at longitudinal \n\nrotation in gliding (Sk7); body position at front and back somersaults (Sk8); leg kick with breath \n\ncontrol at ventral body position, with flutter boards (Sk9); leg kick with breath control at dorsal \n\nbody position with flutter boards (Sk11); and without any flutter device (Sk12); feet-first entry \n\n(Sk13); head-first entry (Sk14); vertical buoyancy at deep water (Sk16); deep water immersion \n\n(Sk17). These substantial differences in the acquired aquatic competence as reported by Costa \n\net al. (2012) can derive from the variability of the teaching intervention, given that teachers \n\nwere not the same in both sessions\u2019 types.  \n\nThe discriminant analysis showed that the Sk5 was the main predictor with significant \n\ncorrelation within function, consistent with the data reported by Costa et al. (2012). This could \n\nbe related with the lower opportunity to develop the glide in ventral/dorsal position and in \n\ndifferent depths in the early learning stages in deep water condition. Probably, the use of \n\nfloating devices caused some changes in the horizontal position and an unreal sense of buoyancy \n\n(Blanksby et al., 1995, Langerdorfer, 1987).  \n\nOur results showed that six months of practices in both conditions allowed students to develop \n\nthe aquatic readiness of the majority of the aquatic basic skills, with exception to body position \n\nat front and back somersaults (SK8), which is in accordance with the results presented by Costa \n\net al. (2012). Moreover, the body position at longitudinal rotation in gliding (Sk7) was nearly \n\nlearned in both conditions probably because it is an aquatic motor skill conditioned by the \n\nprevious acquisition of other basic skills, as the water entry, glide, respiration and static \n\nvertical balance in deep water (Barbosa &amp; Queir\u00f3s, 2004). It would be also important to refer \n\nthat six months of practice in both swimming pool environments were not sufficient to achieve \n\nmastery on all aquatic skills. Similar data have been reported by Costa et al. (2012) after six \n\nand 12 months of aquatic practice.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\nDespite the importance of the results presented to the scientific and technical community, \n\nsome limitations should be addressed to the current study. Firstly, it was only possible to access \n\nthe aquatic competence of the students after six months of practice, ensuring the inclusion \n\ncriterion of keeping the same teacher. Also, the limitation with regard to the size of the sample \n\nobserved, conditioning the conclusions and the extrapolation of the results to other subjects. \n\nThe effect size was used to better control and analyze the differences obtained. Thirdly, no \n\ndata about the activity time devoted to swimming practice in both session types. Although the \n\nnumber of students has been reduced to enable high activity time in both sessions, we recognize \n\nthat differences regarding this variable may exist. Future studies should assess the variation of \n\nactivity time regarding to different learning contexts, number of students and teaching styles. \n\nFuture studies should also seek to analyze the effectiveness of concurrent water depth \n\nenvironments programs (shallow and deep water) and the question of timing and dosing of \n\nswimming practice. \n\n \n\n3.7 Conclusions \n\nIn conclusion, the present study suggests that a shallow water environment is more suitable for \n\nthe development of basic aquatic skills in preschool children. The stepwise discriminant analysis \n\nrevealed a significant association between both session types and four included aquatic skills \n\nfor six months of practice; the body position at ventral gliding seems to be the main significant \n\npredictor. This could mean that aquatic skills at the children beginner\u2019s level should be learnt \n\nin a shallow water swimming pool and deep water programs should be carefully planned to \n\nstimulate certain skills (i.e. body gliding) that seems to be differently exercised in both pool \n\nenvironments. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\n3.8 References  \n\n1.

The study\u2019s sample \n\nconsists of 33 preschool-aged boys: 11 children were soccer practitioners; 11 children were \n\nswimming practitioners; 11 children were controls. The Test of Gross Motor Development\u2013\n\nSecond Edition (TGMD-2) was used to assess common gross motor skills [locomotion (LC), object \n\ncontrol skills (OC)]. Both groups improved significantly in their gross motor quotient and the \n\nstandard scores for LC and OC between T5 and T10. At T10, all soccer practitioners have already \n\nreached the maximum descriptive rating for the gross motor quotient (GMQ). Between T10 and \n\nT30, swimming practitioners were able to improve the standard scores for OC. Main results \n\nshowed a positive impact of swimming and soccer participation in motor proficiency. \n\nKeywords: Swimming; soccer; motor development; childhood.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Introduction \n\nChildhood is a key phase in the lifetime of a human being for the development of physical skills \n\nand fundamental psychomotor acquisition, which will allow, further on, the acquisition of a set \n\nof skills to influence the development of more complex motor skills (Gabbard, 2000). \n\nThe gross motor development is the qualitative and quantitative progress in the motor skills, \n\nduring lifetime (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005). The life experience of children and the stimulation \n\nthey have received represent the baseline for the acquisition of more specific and critical motor \n\nskills for the different sport activities (Barnett &amp; Okely, 2010; Clark &amp; Metcalfe, 2002; Hands, \n\nLarkin, Parker, Straker &amp; Perry, 2009; Lubans, Morgan, Cliff, Robinson &amp; Goodway, 2009).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\nThe phase between three and ten years old is considered to be the critical period in the path \n\nof gross motor development and, after that, there\u2019s a period of maturity to the acquired motor \n\nskills. Gallahue and Ozmun (2005) state that the inexistence of a rich and diverse experience \n\nof physical movements may compromise the learning of perceptive, motor and cognitive skills.  \n\nDuring childhood, several important development changes take place, being well established \n\nthe positive influence of physical activity for a healthy growth (Boreham &amp; Riddoch, 2001; \n\nEisenmann, 2003; Malina, 2007; Steele, Brage, Corder, Wareham &amp; Ekelund, 2008). Motor \n\nproficiency has been related with subsequent physical activity (Barnett et al., 2009; Kambas et \n\nal., 2012). However, physical activity leads to the development of fundamental motor skills \n\n(FMS) (Smith et al., 2014), including in children with coordinative difficulties (Kane &amp; Staples, \n\n2014). Therefore, the literature seems to assume the existence of a strong synergistic \n\nrelationship between physical activity and motor development. \n\nIn this particular context, it should be also noted that the development towards specialized \n\nmotor proficiency depends on relevant previous motor experiences in a safe age-appropriate, \n\nstimulating environment (Magill, 2000; Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005). Thus, low or inadequate \n\nmotor stimulation would affect not only the child's motor development (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, \n\n2005; Williams, et al., 2008), but also his cognitive, affective and social state (Sibley &amp; Etnier, \n\n2003; Busseri, Rose-Krasnor, Willoughby, &amp; Chalmers, 2006). Likewise, it is assumed that poor \n\ngross motor development will inhibit children from regular physical activities (e.g., Stodden et \n\nal., 2008; Williams et al., 2008). In the long run, this may also determine a greater likelihood \n\nof becoming sedentary in adulthood (Huotari, Nupponen, Mikkelsson, Laakso, &amp; Kujala, 2011). \n\nFor that reason, we should consider the assumption that childhood isn't only a critical period \n\nfor the acquisition of fundamental motor skills, but also to ensure lifelong participation in sport \n\n(Stodden et al., 2008; Barnett et al., 2009).  \n\nLubans et al., (2010) have studied the relationship between motor competence and health, \n\ncomparing 21 different studies where they identified the relationship between fundamental \n\nmotor skills and self-esteem, the perception of motor competence, muscular and \n\ncardiorespiratory capacity, body mass index, flexibility, physical activity and sedentary \n\nbehavior. In general, those studies revealed a positive connection between fundamental motor \n\nskills and physical exercise, in children and teenagers, as well as a positive connection between \n\nfundamental motor skills and cardiorespiratory capacity. \n\nThe period between five and ten years of age exhibits considerable improvement in general \n\nmotor coordination, allowing the achievement of increasingly complex movements (Gallahue &amp; \n\nOzmun, 2005; Massa &amp; R\u00e9, 2010). During this period of fast neurological development and large \n\nneural plasticity, the child is able to understand the rules of sport and is able to participate in \n\nstructured programs of sport initiation (R\u00e9, 2011). Thus, active children often choose after-\n\nschool sport activities, among them swimming and soccer are the most popular sports in several \n\ncountries. These sports enhance not only motor skills but also physical abilities \u2013 but little is \n\nknown about the effects on gross motor development. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\nDespite the fact that aquatic programs can differ (Jorgensen, 2012), the teaching methodology \n\nusually seeks to introduce children to basic aquatic skills (Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005). Games \n\nand several other fun activities are often used as an appropriate methodological resource to \n\nachieve aquatic readiness (Rocha, Marinho, Ferreira, &amp; Costa, 2014). Studies about the \n\neffectiveness of aquatic interventions on gross motor development are scarce. However, water \n\nsports appear to provide important stimulation of body perception, inducing a positive effect \n\non abilities associated with apprehension and balance (Sigmundsson &amp; Hopkins, 2010). A recent \n\nstudy suggested that children with prior participation in swimming programs (within the \n\neducational context) demonstrate an optimized motor development, on several gross motor \n\nskill tests, but particularly on object control skills (Martins et al.,2015).  \n\nRegarding soccer, the pedagogical intervention values the development of individual skills \n\n(e.g., passing, dribbling, shooting and ball control), but also team effectiveness. Young players \n\nare encouraged to recognize the different game variables (e.g.: opponents, field and goalpost \n\ndimensions) and to assume a tactical collective behavior (Costa, Garganta, Greco, Mesquita &amp; \n\nMaia, 2011). For that reason, contemporary soccer teaching models are supported in tactical \n\nprinciples (Holt, Strean, &amp; Bengoechea, 2002). However, not enough is known about the \n\neffectiveness of the specific measures of soccer adopted in improving gross motor development. \n\nThe literature has sought to determine the effects of community and school physical activities \n\ninfluence on children\u2019s gross motor development. There are hardly any studies on structured \n\nprograms of sport initiation. Furthermore, study designs included randomized controlled trials \n\n(using experimental and quasi-experimental designs) and mostly single group pre-post trials \n\nduring short time scales (&lt;six months).  \n\nGabbard (2000) indicates that the gross motor development is a process of permanent changes \n\nthat occur in the motor behavior of an individual, since his conception to his death, as a result \n\nfrom the interaction between hereditary and environmental factors (Gabbard, 2000). The gross \n\nmotor development is a continuous process in the long run, with bigger changes during the early \n\nyears of life, in the childhood. Therefore, the practice of sport activity in a regular basis \n\ncorresponds to a privileged occasion for the changes of the gross motor development, because \n\nit stimulates a higher development of fundamental motor skills, mainly locomotive and \n\nmanipulative skills.  \n\nAs we see, it seems important to obtain a longitudinal perspective about the impact of specific \n\nsport interventions on motor proficiency particularly because some children unfortunately \n\nnever benefit from any kind of structured physical activity (physical education at school) until \n\nten years old. \n\nThus, this paper aims to describe the longitudinal changes in the gross motor development after \n\nfive, ten and thirty months of swimming or soccer practice. We expect that both sports \n\ninterventions will play a catalytic role in gross motor development. However, we also anticipate \n\ndifferences in the level of acquisition and degree of mastery of some fundamental motor skills. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n4.4 Method \n\n4.4.1 Participants \n\nThis research used a convenience sample of young children that were available to participate \n\nin this study and who had a known history of swimming or soccer participation. The study sample \n\nconsisted of 33 preschool-aged boys (4.8\u00b10.5 yrs.), all residents on the metropolitan area of \n\nLisbon (Portugal). At baseline, the following three groups were considered: 11 children (5.3\u00b10.2 \n\nyrs.) with no previous involvement in sports or any kind of structured physical activity (control \n\ngroup); 11 children (4.6\u00b10.4 yrs.) were involved in swimming classes at a beginner level, with \n\nfive months of practice (swimming group); 11 children (4.8\u00b10.5 yrs.) were involved in soccer \n\nclasses at a beginner level, with five months of practice (soccer group). Children with different \n\nhistory or sport experience (five months at baseline), in these or other structured exercise of \n\nprograms, weren't included in this study. Similarly, all physical or psychological diseases that \n\nmay have precluded ability to perform the requested training exercises and testing were \n\nconsidered exclusion criteria. \n\nThe study included three different moments of assessment: baseline (T5), corresponding to five \n\nmonths of previous practice of swimming or soccer, respectively; after ten months of \n\naccumulated practice (T10) swimming or soccer, respectively; after thirty months of \n\naccumulated practice (T30) swimming or soccer, respectively. The longitudinal nature of this \n\nresearch did not allow an evaluation of the control group after the T10 moment; from this \n\nperiod onwards, most of the children included in this group started practicing sports. For \n\nobvious ethical reasons, researchers didn't inhibit children and/or guardians from being \n\ninvolved in sport. Similarly, we couldn't make any follow-up assessment beyond 30 months of \n\npractice. \n\nAll experimental procedures and protocols were compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki and \n\nwere approved in advance by the Data Protection Authority in Portugal (Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de \n\nProtec\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados), by the managers of local swimming and football schools involved in this \n\nstudy and by the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Beira \n\nInterior. Data confidentiality was guaranteed as well as participant\u2019s anonymity. \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Gross motor development assessment \n\nThe \u201ctest of gross motor development 2\u201d (TGMD-2) [Ulrich, 2000] was used to assess children\u2019s \n\ncompetence of fundamental motor skills in three distinct moments: after five (T5), ten (T10) \n\nand thirty (T30) months of sports practice. The TGMD-2 is a norm-referenced measure with a \n\ngood psychometric quality to assess gross motor skills that develop early in life (Ulrich, 2000). \n\nIt has been used by several researchers in different countries, including for longitudinal follow \n\nup (Cliff, Okely, Smith, &amp; McKeen, 2009; Cliff, Wilson, Okely, Mickle, &amp; Steele, 2007; \n\nWestendorp et al., 2014). It assesses twelve fundamental motor skills typically taught in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n71 \n\nphysical education to children aged from three to ten years old (Wiart &amp; Darrah, 2001). Skills \n\nare divided into two subtests: Locomotion (run, gallop, hop, leap, horizontal jump, skip, and \n\nslide) and Object Control (two-handed strike, stationary bounce, catch, kick and the overhand \n\nthrow).  Each skill defined by the TGMD-2 consists of components that together constitute \n\nmature performance of that skill. \n\nAfter a standard warm-up, each skill was performed three times and measured with three to \n\nfour observable criteria based upon typical movement patterns identified from motor \n\ndevelopment literature and suggested by Ulrich (2000). Each criterion was rated as zero (the \n\ncriterion is observed on fewer than two of the three trials) or one (criterion is observable on at \n\nleast two of the three trials). The highest total raw score for both subtests is 48. Subtest raw \n\nscores were then converted to standard scores (ranging between one and 20) for both subtests, \n\nconsidering the child's age at the time. Subtest standard scores (locomotion and objected \n\ncontrol) are then summed and converted to calculate each child\u00b4s gross motor development \n\nquotient.  \n\nAs proposed by the author (Ulrich, 2000), all participants repeated the TGMD-2 one week later \n\n(retest) in T5, T10 and in T30. All evaluations were conducted by two researchers familiar with \n\nthe TGMD-2 battery, including the evaluation criteria for each fundamental motor skill. Even \n\nso, we performed several training sessions in our laboratory. One small pilot study was also \n\nconducted using a restricted sample of five children (4.9 \u00b10.5 years), not considered in the \n\nanalysis. These five children were evaluated twice in a weekly timeframe. The intra-class \n\ncorrelation coefficients (as a measure of reliability) were very high for all measured skills \n\n(ranged from 0.80 to 1.00). \n\nAll assessments were recorded on video (Sony camera, HDR-CX115 model) that was used only \n\nfor the purpose of this study. The two observers analyzed the images obtained and reviewed \n\nthe individual performance for each motor skill, according to the proposed criteria. Then, it \n\nwas given an opportunity to discuss each performance and the respective score.  \n\nTests and retest were applied effectively in T5, T10 and T30, always under the same conditions \n\n(outdoor sport field), at the same time of day and with similar weather conditions (without \n\nrain, light breeze and on a mild air temperature). Participants wore shorts and t-shirts. \n\n \n\n4.4.3 Swimming and soccer practice \n\nTraining sessions for swimming and soccer occurred at the same time, twice a week (between \n\n6h00 and 6h45 pm). In both sports the intervention program was elementary, following mostly \n\na mixed pedagogical concept using games to incite children to engage into learning activities \n\nbut also some individual analytical motor tasks. \n\nSwimming lessons were carried out in deep pool (plus than 1.30m) with a water temperature \n\nof 31.5\u00baC (the air temperature was 29\u00b0C\u00b11 and the relative humidity was 65%). The aquatic \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n72 \n\nprogram aimed to improve children\u2019s aquatic readiness by teaching basic aquatic fundamental \n\nskills. At the beginning of the study all children were in a state of total inaptness to the aquatic \n\nenvironment with no ability to perform intended propelling actions. The pedagogical \n\nintervention was based on Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Canossa et al., (2007). The \n\nfollowing aquatic motor skills were developed: water entry; water orientation and adjustment \n\nat vertical position; breath control - immersion of the face and eye opening; horizontal \n\nbuoyancy; body position at ventral gliding; body position at dorsal gliding; body position at \n\nlongitudinal rotation in gliding; body position at front and back somersaults; leg kick with \n\nbreath control at ventral body position, with flutter boards and without any flutter device; leg \n\nkick with breath control at dorsal body position with flutter boards and without any flutter \n\ndevice; feet-first and head-first entry; autonomous in deep pool (legs and arms displacement); \n\nvertical buoyancy at deep water and deep-water immersion.  \n\nThe soccer practice was conducted in the outdoor school sports field with synthetic grass. The \n\nsessions were planned following a coherent pedagogical approach with the latest models of \n\nsoccer teaching (e.g., Bunkerm &amp; Thorpe, 1982; Costa et al., 2011; Holt, Strean, &amp; Bengoechea, \n\n2002). Throughout the soccer study teaching program sought to develop three major \n\ncapabilities: the ability to select appropriate solutions before different game problems \n\n(decision making); the ability to perform effectively (technical training to enhance dribbling, \n\npassing, shooting, finishing and also the weak foot for youth soccer players) and the ability to \n\nplay as a team (communicate and cooperate). Hence, children\u2019s specific technical skills were \n\ndeveloped (mastery of body movement with/without the ball) but also their tactical awareness. \n\nTraining sessions for swimming and soccer occurred at the same time, twice a week (between \n\n6h00pm and 6h45pm). In both sports, the intervention program was elementary, following \n\nmostly a mixed pedagogical concept using games to incite children to engage into learning \n\nactivities, but also some individual analytical motor tasks. \n\n \n\n4.4.4 Analysis \n\nDescriptive statistics were the mean and standard deviation. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was \n\nused to evaluate the normality of the distribution of the variables. The Mann-Whitney U test \n\nwas used to compare differences between two independent groups. Kruskal-Walli?s test was \n\nused for multiple group comparisons. The intra-group difference between assessment moments \n\nwas tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank-sum test. The analyses were adjusted using the \n\nHolm\u2019s sequential Bonferroni correction (Holm, 1979); according to this sequential multiple \n\ntest procedure, the adjusted p-value for n paired comparisons is: pBonferroni C = (C ? i + 1) \u00d7 \n\np; where C correspond to number of comparisons and i rank of the pair in terms of degree of \n\nsignificance. The nonparametric effect size was obtained from the following equation \n\n(Rosenthal, 1994): r = Z/?N. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used as a measure \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n73 \n\nof consistency of ratings over time. To establish statistical significance, a p?.05 criterion was \n\nused. All data were analyzed using the software SPSS 22.0. \n\n \n\n4.5 Results \n\nTable 14 presents the subtests scores (raw and standard scores) and the gross motor quotient \n\nfor all groups and assessment moments separately. Both experimental groups showed \n\nsignificant improvements between T5 and T10 in the gross motor quotient and in the standard \n\nscores of both subtests. The control group shows no significant improvement in this regard. \n\nSignificant differences were found (p>0.05) between groups at T5, T10 and T30 for the object \n\ncontrol standard score and also for the gross motor quotient.

Between T5 and T10, one can note significant improvements (p<0.05) in \n\nrunning proficiency, in control participants. During this period, the soccer practitioners \n\nimproved significantly their standard scores in hopping. In turn, the swimmers showed \n\nimprovements (p<0.05) in running, galloping and hopping but not in leaping, horizontal jumping \n\nand sliding. Between T10 and T30, soccer players showed no significant improvements in these \n\nskills. Within a longer range (T5 versus T30), swimmers were able to improve their motor \n\nproficiency in running, galloping and hopping. As for the soccer players, locomotor skills \n\nimproved significantly (p<0.05) between T5 and T30 only for hopping. At T5, the inter-group \n\ncomparison showed no significant differences between groups in these skills. However, groups \n\ndiffer from each other in T10 (p&lt;0.05) in almost all locomotor skills, being the group of soccer \n\npractitioners more proficient (p&lt;0.05) than swimmers in hop (p =0.47, r=0.68).

Following the trend observed \n\nin the locomotor subtest, between T5 and T10 the control group didn\u2019t show any significant \n\nvariations in these object control skills. During this period, soccer players show proficiency \n\nincreases on most evaluated fundamental skills, except in underhand roll and catch (the \n\nproficiency level in T5 for the catch skill was already maximum). However, the swimmers were \n\nable to improve their motor proficiency in striking a stationary ball, in stationary dribble and \n\nalso in underhand roll. Between T10 and T30, no significant variations were identified in soccer \n\nplayer\u2019s motor proficiency for any object control skills, due to the high level already achieved \n\nin T10. In turn, the swimmers showed a significant evolution in almost all the skills tested during \n\nthis period. In a long-term perspective (T5 vs. T30), both experimental groups show significant \n\nimprovements in most object control skills. At T5 and T10, significant differences (p<0.05) were \n\nfound between groups, in most object control skills, except for striking a stationary ball (T5 \n\nand T10) and for overhand throw (T5). Actually, at T5 and T10 the group of soccer practitioners \n\nwere even more proficient than swimmers in stationary dribble (T5, p=0.021, r=0.69; T10, \n\np=0.002, r=0.95), catch (T5, p=0.002, r=0.95; T10, p=0.002, r=0.93), kick (T5, p=0.010, r=0.78; \n\nT10, p=0.002, r=0.92) and underhand roll (T5, p=0.001, r=1.05). At T30, following the trend of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\nthe previous subset, no significant differences were found between the practitioners of \n\nswimming and soccer. \n\n \n\nTable 17 \n\nRaw and standard scores for the Object Control subtest \n\n  Striking a \n\nstationary \n\nball \n\n(0-10) \n\nStationary \n\ndribble \n\n(0-8) \n\nCatch \n\n(0-6) \n\nKick \n\n(0-8) \n\nOverhand \n\nthrow \n\n(0-8) \n\nUnderhand \n\nroll \n\n(0-8) \n\nC\no\nn\ntr\n\no\nls\n\n  T5 7.09\u00b12.59 4.55\u00b13.24a 4.36\u00b11.96 a 6.73\u00b12.05 a 5.82\u00b12.75 3.27\u00b11.85 a \n\nT10 7.45\u00b13.36 3.82\u00b13.40 a 4.27\u00b11.10 a 7.555\u00b10.82 a 4.55\u00b12.84 a 4.55\u00b11.81 a \n\nPairwise \n\ncomparisons \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.722, r.11) \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.496, r=.21) \n\nT5=T10 \n\n(p=.829, r=.07) \n\nT5=T10 \n\n(p=.279, r=.33) \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.102, r=.49) \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.102, r=.49) \n\nS\nw\n\nim\nm\n\nin\ng\n g\n\nr\no\nu\np\n \n\nT5 7.27\u00b13.00 1.82\u00b13.28 a,b 3.27\u00b12.00 a,b 4.82\u00b12.14 a,b 5.55\u00b12.88 3.36\u00b12.20 a,b \n\nT10 9.27\u00b11.35 4.27\u00b12.80 a,b 4.09\u00b12.21 a,b 5.82\u00b12.14 a,b 7.09\u00b11.64 a 5.64\u00b11.50 a \n\nT30 10.00\u00b1.000 7.64\u00b1.81 5.64\u00b1.81 7.64\u00b1.81 7.64\u00b1.81 7.64\u00b1.81 \n\nPairwise \n\ncomparisons \n\nT5<T10 \n\n(p=.027, r=.67) \n\nT10=T30 \n\n(p=.102, r=.49) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.017, r=.72) \n\nT5<T10 \n\n(p=.011, r=.76) \n\nT10<T30 \n\n(p=.007, r=.81) \n\nT5<T30 (p=.006, \n\nr=.83) \n\nT5=T10 \n\n(p=.230, r=.36) \n\nT10<T30 \n\n(p=.016, r=.73) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.007, r=.81) \n\nT5=T10 \n\n(p=.139, r=.45) \n\nT10<T30 \n\n(p=.016, r=.73) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.007, r=.81) \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.078, r=.53) \n\nT10<T30 \n\n(p=.083, r=.52) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.026, r=.67) \n\nT5<T10 \n\n(p=.016, r=.72) \n\nT10<T30 \n\n(p=.005, r=.85) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.003, r=.90) \n\nS\no\nc\nc\ne\nr\n g\n\nr\no\nu\np\n \n\nT5 5.91\u00b11.30 4.18\u00b11.47 a,b 6.00\u00b11.18 a,b 7.09\u00b1.70 a,b 6.45\u00b1.93 6.91\u00b1.70 a,b \n\nT10 9.45\u00b11.29 7.64\u00b1.81 a,b 6.00\u00b1.000 a,b 8.00\u00b1.000 a,b 8.00\u00b1.000 a 6.73\u00b11.62 a \n\nT30 10.00\u00b1.000 8.00\u00b1.000 6.00\u00b1.000 8.00\u00b1.000 8.00\u00b1.000 8.00\u00b1.000 \n\nPairwise \n\ncomparisons \n\nT5<T10  \n\n(p=.005, r=.85) \n\nT10=T30  \n\n(p=.180, r=.40) \n\nT5<T30  \n\n(p=.003, r=.90) \n\nT5<T10  \n\n(p=.003, r=.89) \n\nT10=T30  \n\n(p=.157, r=.43) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.003, r=.89) \n\nT5=T10  \n\n(p=.942, r=.02) \n\nT10=T30 \n\n(p=1.00, r=.0) \n\nT5<T30  \n\n(p=942, r=.02) \n\nT5<T10 \n\n(p=0.008, r=.80) \n\nT10=T30 \n\n(p=1.00, r=.0) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.008, r=.80) \n\nT5<T10 \n\n(p=.006, r=.83) \n\nT10=T30  \n\n(p=1.00, r=.0) \n\nT5<T30 \n\n(p=.006, r=.83) \n\nT5=T10 \n\n(p=.726, r=.11) \n\nT10<T30  \n\n(p=0.38, r=.62) \n\nT5<T30  \n\n(p=.006, r=.83) \n\nNote.

In general, our results showed a positive \n\nimpact of these two sports participation in motor proficiency.  \n\nAssuming development as a dynamic system, different practice opportunities and even small \n\ndifferences in beginning states can amplify and lead to large individual differences in motor \n\ndevelopment (Smith &amp; Thelen, 2003). So, motor performance seems notably fragile and context \n\ndependent. This is an important reason why we should understand the processes by which sports \n\nactivities are influenced, leading to changes on a longer time-scale. This research aims to \n\ncontribute to this particular need, enabled us to obtain a more systematic view of the effect \n\nof sports practice over time.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\nFirst, we want to point out that even in a context of lack of sports participation (control group), \n\nfive months (between T5 and T10) were sufficient to induce a significant impact on running \n\nability (p=0.039). This seems consistent with the qualitative changes that often follows the \n\nbody size growth, leading to increased levels of strength and coordination that inherently \n\nimprove running performance (Haywood &amp; Getchell, 2004). Indeed, raw scores for five, six and \n\nseven years old children are expected to increase significantly with age (Afonso et al., 2009; \n\nAponte, French, &amp; Sherrill, 1990; Ulrich, 2000). However, five months were not enough to \n\nidentify significant variations in the other eleven fundamental motor skills that seem more \n\nstable over the times. In fact, our results showed no significant decreases in the raw score \n\nmeans for various skills, including the standard score mean for the object control subtest (see \n\ntable 14). Although we have controlled the participation in sportive activities, the \n\ncircumstances and the peculiarities of the children\u2019s play weren't assessed. We recognize that \n\nthis can, eventually, influence the results, just like the majority of the studies in this area. \n\nNevertheless, it seems justified to note that the expected evolution in motor development with \n\nage isn't merely dependent on the children\u2019s growth and maturation, but is also highly \n\ninfluenced by environmental conditions (different practice opportunities) and suitability of the \n\nmotor stimulation (e.g., Gallahue &amp; Ozmun, 2005; Clark, 2007). \n\nThe fast evolution of motor proficiency in the first few months of sport participation (between \n\nT5 and T10) seems to be another important point to note in our results. Indeed, both \n\nexperimental groups showed significant improvements between five and ten months of practice \n\nin locomotor and object control raw scores and also in the gross motor development quotient \n\n(see table 14). Between T10 and T30, motor proficiency is clearly less improved in both \n\npractitioners, but particularly in soccer practitioners. This is due to the fact that they have \n\nreached near maximum levels of proficiency in several fundamental motor skills at T10. In fact, \n\nwe found that all soccer practitioners reach a \u201cvery superior\u201d descriptive rate for the gross \n\nmotor development in T10. The TGMD-2 battery has a high degree of reliability and low-test \n\nerror (Wiart &amp; Darrah, 2001), but it seems to have little sensitivity to age-related improvements \n\nin participants with high or maximum motor development levels. In our opinion, this seems to \n\nbe the most plausible reason for the decrease in both subtest standard scores (and also in the \n\ngross motor quotient), between T10 and T30, when the raw score in most fundamental motor \n\nskills increases and reaches maximum values (or nearly that). This score limitation at the top \n\nof a scale is commonly termed \u201cceiling effect\u201d (Wang, Zhang, McArdle &amp; Salthouse, 2009). \n\nThe inter-group differences in motor proficiency are also an important outcome that should be \n\nhighlighted. The results show inter-group differences that are more evident for object control \n\nskills in T5 and for locomotion skills in T10. This seems to mean that object control skills are \n\nmore sensitive to the effects of soccer practice than actually locomotion skills, at least in these \n\nages. In fact, in T5 no differences in locomotion skills were noticed between groups. Despite \n\nthe difficulty in comparing these results due to lack of studies about this subject, the \n\ninterpretation appears to be related to the comparability of training stimulation in interaction \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n78 \n\nwith biological factors (Malina &amp; Bouchard, 2001). The object control skills are clearly \n\ndeveloped through stimulation that requires different levels of organization (e.g.: two or more \n\nchildren to play and different forms of playing), and objects availability. In turn, locomotor \n\nskills tend to be held more trivially, spontaneously and less dependent on environment and \n\ngender differences. For that reason, the locomotion subtest raw scores are converted into \n\nstandard scores, regardless of gender, and the same isn\u2019t true for the object control skills.  \n\nThe results regarding the continued evolution in object control proficiency in swimmers seem \n\nconsistent with the data presented by Martins et al. (2015). These authors showed that previous \n\nswimming practice seems to induce a positive effect on several gross motor skills, but \n\nparticularly on objects control skills. Games are used, mainly, as a natural methodological \n\napproach to teach aquatic readiness, because they combine both motivation and educational \n\neffectiveness and often the handling of several teaching materials for specific recreational \n\npurposes (Rocha et. al., 2014).  \n\nNotwithstanding, for the relevance of the present results, this study has several limitations. \n\nFirst, no information about the children\u2019s play habits and/or objectively measured physical \n\nactivity levels and patterns were available; these data would be very helpful in explaining the \n\nresults, namely the motor proficiency increases with age. Second, no follow-up assessments \n\nafter a period of no sport-specific intervention were conducted; this would allow us to observe \n\nif these effects in motor proficiency are well founded. Third, no baseline data about the \n\nparticipant\u2019s motor proficiency, before sport practice; this would be valuable to understand \n\nthe initial (first five months) effects of the practice of both sports. We may also point to a \n\nfourth and final limitation that seems to arise by the lack of sensitivity of the TGMD-2 battery \n\nto discriminate improvements in children of high-level motor proficiency. Further research \n\nattention is needed to explore possible methods of dealing with this ceiling effect in TGMD-2 \n\nlongitudinal data. \n\n \n\n4.7 Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the present study shows that sport practice during childhood seems to contribute \n\nto a higher motor development. Despite of the improved motor skill competence of soccer \n\npractitioners at short and long-term, swimming practitioners show an on-going motor \n\ndevelopment particularly on object control skills. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n79 \n\n4.8 References \n\n1.

This was a descriptive research. \n\nWith the results from that study we could find some deficiencies in the integration of swimming \n\npractice in the elementary school\u2019s program and probably those are limitations of the efficiency \n\nof the teaching method adopted, in respect to the acquisition of more complex aquatic skills. \n\nElementary schools with swimming practice in their educational program are doing it \n\nexclusively for students of the third and fourth level/year (in line with the indications from the \n\nPortuguese Ministry of Education), with weekly sessions and classes with too much students. \n\nThe swimming sessions are used basically to develop basic aquatic skills and the will of \n\npracticing this sport, using some didactic material occasionally. In those elementary schools \n\nwere swimming practice is out of school program, budget restrictions and difficulties to get \n\ntransportation for students between school and swimming pool are reasons given to exclude \n\nswimming practice.   \n\nThe second investigation topic is related to the pedagogy of swimming. We have proposed to \n\nanalyze the influence of an important variable of context \u2013 water depth \u2013 in the acquisition of \n\nbasic aquatic skills by children. In that respect, the results have shown that we get a better \n\nperformance in shallow water than in deep water, after six months of practice. We have found \n\nsignificant differences (p &lt;0.05) between the sample groups, with respect to the motor \n\nproficiency of five aquatic skills: breath control, immersion of the face and eye opening (Sk3); \n\nhorizontal buoyancy (Sk4); body position at ventral gliding (Sk5); body position at dorsal gliding \n\n(Sk6); leg kick with breath control at ventral body position, without any flutter device (Sk9). \n\nThe body position during gliding was the main relevant predictor (r = 0.535). Therefore, it\u2019s \n\nprobably more suitable to teach swimming in shallow water, during the initial phase of practice. \n\nIf we have access only to deep swimming pools, we suggest that the swimming teaching program \n\nshould focus on developing the acquisition of aquatic skills that normally draw less attention \n\nfrom teachers, like gliding, for instance. \n\nThe third as last investigation topic of this thesis is related to the motor development. With \n\nthis study, we had the objective of knowing the importance of sports in the gross motor \n\ndevelopment, by describing the impact brought by the practice of swimming or soccer, in the \n\nshort, mid and long term (five, ten and 30 months, respectively). The results indicate that \n\nsports during childhood have an important contribute to the gross motor development. Soccer \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n84 \n\nseems to have great influence on the motor development, because, after ten months of \n\npractice, soccer practitioners have achieved the highest proficiency levels in several \n\nfundamental motor skills (both at the locomotor level and object control). The impact of \n\nswimming practice on terrestrial fundamental motor skills is positive, contributing to a gradual \n\nmotor development, especially in respect to skills of object control. \n\n \n\n5.2 Limitations and directions for future research \n\nThis thesis has some relevant limitations. The critical observation of those limitations is not \n\njust desirable from a scientific accuracy perspective, but, above all, it will help opening the \n\ndoor for future research based on or in the sequence of the object of this thesis. \n\nIn relation to the first study hereby presented, the major limitation is related to the size of the \n\nsample used. Although we have collected and analyzed the data from 30% of Portuguese \n\nmunicipalities, this data is not fully representative of the current situation nationwide.  \n\nBecause the major part of the inquired municipalities didn\u2019t answer our survey, we weren\u2019t \n\nable to get a wider perspective. The same has happened with the inquired teachers. Besides \n\nthat, our study only presents descriptive data and there\u2019s no records about the effectiveness \n\nof the swimming programs used, in the long run.  \n\nFor future research, we consider it\u2019s very important to analyze the level of aquatic \n\ndevelopment of Portuguese children, in the school context. For child safety reasons, the follow-\n\nup of aquatic development during childhood is not just relevant from a scientific perspective, \n\nbut, most important, should be considered a social and political concern. It is also important \n\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the swimming teaching programs used. In the second and third \n\nyears of elementary school, swimming is considered as an optional complementary activity \n\n(sport practice at school). The characteristics of that practice and, in particular, its connection \n\nto local entities, like swimming clubs and collectivities, should be taken as an important subject \n\nof future study in more detail, with the objective of developing the practice of swimming. \n\nThe second study has three important constraints, as we have earlier mentioned: (i) the \n\nevaluation of the effectiveness of swimming teaching within a period of six months only, which \n\nis not enough to accurately assess its impact in the development of swimming skills of the \n\npractitioner, related to the context variable \u201cdepth level\u201d (shallow water, deep water), in the \n\nlong run; (ii) the small size of sample in both experimental groups; (iii) the lack of time control \n\nof motor involvement in both kind of session. This limitation is our strongest recommendation \n\nfor future studies around this subject \u2013 lesson time control in the context of different kind of \n\nteaching and different methodologies, especially with programs using both depth options \n\n(shallow water and deep water \u2013 a very common practice, as we have demonstrated in the first \n\nstudy). We consider it is also very important to measure the influence of other variables in the \n\neffectiveness of swimming teaching: number of practitioners per class, number of sessions per \n\nweek (intensive blocks vs. less intensive blocks), or the use the usage of didactic material. We \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n85 \n\nbelieve it is necessary to have a clearer understanding of the impact of different pedagogical \n\napproaches of swimming teaching in the motor, social and cognitive development of children, \n\nespecially the richness of stimulations that we see in aquatic recreation programs. Finally, we \n\nthink it is also important to point out that, although the teaching program used in both depth \n\nlevels is identical, the development of swimming practice in deep water seems to have specific \n\nconstraints, especially to beginners \u2013 the sense of unsafety (risk of drowning) is undoubtedly \n\nhigher in deep water, which may represent an inhibition factor to children, with a critical \n\ninfluence in the development of basic aquatic skills, during the initial phase of swimming \n\nlearning, which main objective is to make the child to be more confident in the aquatic \n\nenvironment. We haven\u2019t evaluated the stress level resulted from a more \u201cintensive\u201d swimming \n\nlearning context; this is, therefore, a relevant subject for future studies, especially the \n\nmeasure of the neuro-endocrine reaction before and after each swimming session and during \n\nthe whole program.  \n\nIn respect to the last study, one of the major limitations is the lack of data about the ludic \n\nhabits and the physical condition of children that have participated in the study. Such data \n\nwould be very useful in having a clear understanding of the results achieved with this study, \n\nespecially with regards to the motor proficiency, with the increasing age. The lack of data \n\nabout the gross motor development in the initial phase of the swimming program (until five \n\nmonths of practice) represents another important constraint, although both experimental \n\ngroups have initiated the program at the same time and with the same weekly frequency and \n\nduration. As we have mentioned earlier, we have faced some limitations in the TGMD-2 \n\nevaluation program in identifying improvements of motor proficiency close or even above an \n\nadvanced level. From our perspective, the solution for this issue is a good subject for future \n\nstudies, exploring possible methods to overcome the \u201ccelling effect\u201d in the TGMD-2 program, \n\nwith longitudinal data. We also consider a very good subject for future studies the elaboration \n\na clear set of factors to define the motor development during childhood, by combining physical \n\naspects, contexts and opportunities of learning and stimulation programs. This will bring \n\nimportant guidance into the definition of school and non-school swimming programs. Given the \n\nfact that the motor development is qualitative, sequential and even cumulative, it would be \n\nvery important to know better the relationship between the progress of motor proficiency in \n\nfundamental physical skills and the progress of the acquisition of specific skills in different \n\nsports, including swimming.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEXES \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n87 \n\nAnnex I: Teaching swimming practice in \n\nthe elementary school \u2013 swimming \n\nteacher survey  \n\n(translated version) \n\n \n\nI.
