Localiza-se dentro dos org\u00e3os de equil\u00edbrio, os estatocistos. \n\nApesar de terem sido j\u00e1 bem estudados na classe Cephalopoda, pouco se \n\nsabe atualmente sobre a sua estrutura, composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e poss\u00edvel uso \n\npara esclerocronologia na classe Gastropoda. O presente trabalho prop\u00f5e \n\ncaracterizar o estat\u00f3lito em diferentes esp\u00e9cies de gastr\u00f3podes, desde os que \n\nhabitam o ambiente marinho, \u00e1gua doce e terrestre. Procurou-se descrever a \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do estatocisto nas diferentes subclasses e a diversidade de \n\nestat\u00f3litos existente nesta classe. Verificou-se que nas subclasses \n\nPatellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda e Heterobranchia, as esp\u00e9cies apresentam \n\nm\u00faltiplas estatoc\u00f3nias no interior do estatocisto, que nestes casos se localiza \n\nentre os g\u00e2nglios pedais e pleurais. Na subclasse Caenogastropoda as \n\nesp\u00e9cies analisadas apresentam o estatocisto  localizado em posi\u00e7\u00e3o dorsal, \n\nsob os g\u00e2nglios pedais, e apresentam um estat\u00f3lito por estatocisto. O facto das \n\nesp\u00e9cies da subclasse Caenogastropoda terem um estat\u00f3lito em vez de \n\nestatoconia, faz com que estas esp\u00e9cies tenham um maior interesse para \n\nestudos de esclerocronologia. \n\nO estat\u00f3ltio dos gastr\u00f3podes \u00e9 uma estrutura aproximadamente esf\u00e9rica de \n\ncarbonato de c\u00e1lcio. No seu interior apresenta an\u00e9is conc\u00eantricos descritos \n\ncomo sendo poss\u00edveis an\u00e9is de crescimento. Verificou-se que na esp\u00e9cie \n\nNucella lapillus o estat\u00f3lito aumenta proporcionalmente de tamanho com o \n\ncrescimento do animal, desde o embri\u00e3o at\u00e9 a fase adulta.  \n\n\u00c9 descrita pela primeira vez a composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica do estat\u00f3lito de Nassarius \n\nreticulatus por microan\u00e1lise com microssonda eletr\u00f3nica ao longo do raio do \n\nestat\u00f3lito.  Os principais elementos qu\u00edmicos presentes s\u00e3o: c\u00e1lcio (Ca), \n\noxig\u00e9nio (O), estr\u00f4ncio (Sr), s\u00f3dio (Na) e enxofre (S). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nResumo (cont.) \n\n \nComo o estat\u00f3lito acompanha o crescimento do indiv\u00edduo pode guardar inscrito \n\nem si um importante registo qu\u00edmico caracter\u00edstico do meio em que o animal \n\nest\u00e1 inserido, desde o seu nascimento e at\u00e9 ao momento de an\u00e1lise. No \n\nentanto, no presente estudo n\u00e3o foram detetadas diferen\u00e7as significativas nas \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos elementos qu\u00edmicos acima referidos ao longo do raio do \n\nestat\u00f3lito, nos diferentes incrementos analisados, nem foi observado qualquer \n\npadr\u00e3o elementar indicativo de sazonalidade na deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos ao \n\nlongo do raio do estat\u00f3lito. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nStatolith, Statoconia, Statocyst, Gastropods \n\n \n\nAbstract The statolith, analogous to the otolith, has been shown to be an important tool \nfor age estimation and growth studies. The statolith is located inside a special \n\nchamber named statocyst. The statocyst is the organ of balance of most \n\ninvertebrates, and is present in a wide range of taxonomic groups of \n\ninvertebrates. Although there is plenty of research regarding the \n\nstatoliths/statocysts in the class Cephalopoda, there is a surprising lack of \n\ninformation regarding this structure in the Gastropoda. This work intends to \n\ncharacterize the statolith in gastropods, and assess the diversity of statoliths in \n\nthis class. It was found that in subclasses Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda \n\nand Heterobranchia, species present multiple statoconia inside the statocyst, \n\nwhich is located between the pedal and pleural ganglia; in turn, in subclass \n\nCaenogastropoda, the analyzed species present a single statolith in each \n\nstatocyst and the statocyst is located dorsally under the pedal ganglia. The fact \n\nthat species of subclass Caenogastropoda have one statolith instead of \n\nstatoconia makes them more useful for sclerochronology studies. \n\nThe gastropod statolith is a spherical structure of calcium carbonate that \n\npresents concentric rings. Although these concentric rings are reported has \n\ngrowth rings, the statolith ontogeny is not completely known. It was verified that \n\nin Nucella lapillus the statolith increases in diameter followins the growth of the \n\nanimal from the embryo to maturity.  \nFor the first time, it was described the chemical composition of the statolith of \n\nNassarius reticulatus adults by electron probe microanalysis. The major \n\nelements found in statoliths were calcium (Ca), oxygen (O), strontium (Sr), \n\nsodium (Na) and sulfur (S). \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nAbstract (cont.) \n\n \nThe statolith increments deposition follow the growth of the animal throughout life \n\nand may probably provide an important register of the chemical characteristics of \n\nthe environment in which the animal live, throughout ontogeny. However, this \n\nwork could not reveal any significant differences in these elements \n\nconcentrations throughout the statolith radius (between increments), neither \n\nevidences of any particular pattern on the occurrence of elements periodical \n\ncycles in the statolith rings.  \n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nList of Figures .............................................................................................................................................. 2 \n\nList of Tables ............................................................................................................................................... 5 \n\nChapter 1 - Introduction .............................................................................................................................. 7 \n\n1.1 References ....................................................................................................................................... 12 \n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Gastropod statocyst diversity .................................................................................................. 13 \n\n2.1.

In fact, people can easily name a body part used for each of these senses as \n\nthey can see or feel their eyes, ears, skin, nose and tongue, and they can recognize the \n\nuse of each of them to explore specific properties of objects in the surrounding \n\nenvironment. If we would then ask them to explore a set of objects spread in a given \n\nspace they would move to get close to the objects and should recognize that they were \n\nusing another crucial sense that helps them to orientate and to control their equilibrium. \n\nIn fact, while moving they feel accelerations in many directions (top/bottom, front/back, \n\nright/left) and they keep postural control in relation to gravity. This further sense is \n\nprovided by a specific mechanoreceptor organ located in the human inner ear that \n\nprovides perception of acceleration and position (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Inner ear: Cochlear and Semicircular canals. According to the movement of the body, otoconia move within \n\nthe semicircular canals. Adapted from Hain 2011. \n\n \n\nThe type of georeceptor organ described above is ubiquitous in the living world \n\nand has evolved since the dawn of life on earth. In plants (see Figure 2), the plastids, \n\nknown as amyloplasts, act for sensing gravity (Morita 2010).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Left: Root structure. Amyloplasts are visible in columella cells in the root cap. Right: Structure of the \n\ncolumella cell, showing the nucleus (N), vacuole (V), amyloplast (A), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Adapated from \n\nMorita 2010. \n\nEven free living cells like the protists are able to perceive gravity either by \n\nintracellular receptors (statocyst like organelles, see below), heavy cell organelles (such as \n\nthe nucleus) and/or by sensing the cell mass by means of ion channels located in the cell \n\nmembrane (Br\u00e4ucker et al. 2002). An evolved georeceptor organ appears in metazoans. \n\nThe simplest form of this organ - the statocyst - occurs in the invertebrates and consists of \n\na chamber containing a free solid granule or a mass of cohering grains, generally \n\ndesignated as statolith. The displacement of the statolith due to changes in the position \n\nof the animal stimulates local sensory cells, indicating the body position in respect to \n\ngravity. This organ has developed considerably through evolutionary progression from \n\ninvertebrates to vertebrates and despite great differences in its ontogeny and structure, \n\nthe physical principle of functioning remained basically the same.  \n\nThe simplest metazoans showing statocysts are the Cnidaria and the Ctenofora. For \n\ninstance, the scyphozoan jellyfishes possess statocysts within club-shaped structures \n\ncalled rhopalia, which are distributed along the margins of the swimming bell. In each \n\nrhopalia a tubular piece of tissue hangs free with a statocyst at its terminal edge. Dense \n\naggregations of nerve tissue are associated with the rhopalia and control the rhythmic \n\ncontraction of the swimming bell. When the animal tilts in a given direction the statoliths \n\nstimulates certain sensory cilia. This generates action potentials in associated nerve cells \n\nthat will trigger contractions of the bell in order to re-establish the vertical posture \n\n(Pechenik 1996). The Ctenofora is another group of animals at about the same level of \n\norganization than cnidarians, popularly known as sea-gooseberries or comb-jellies \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n(Fretter and Graham 1976) that possess one apical statocyst (Hickman et al. 2006) that \n\nalso functions as a gravity sense organ. The same general type of statocysts are present in \n\nmost of other invertebrates, such as annelids, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, \n\ntunicates, etc. (Fretter and Graham 1976; Purchon 1977; Barnes 1980), though the \n\nmicrostructure and shape of the statocyst varies amongst taxa. The statolith may consist \n\nof a single or multiple small calcareous concretions (e.g. molluscs) or cohering sand grains \n\n(e.g. crustaceans) (Fretter and Graham 1976). They may even consist of diatom shells and \n\nquartz grains covered by chitinous material in some polychaete families (Barnes 1980). \n\nStatocysts may also present a closed structure (e.g. molluscs) or may retain an opening to \n\nthe exterior (e.g. crustacean). In the latter case, the grains of sand that lie inside the \n\nstatocyst of crustaceans, which function as statolith, are lost in each molt and new ones \n\nare picked up through the statocyst opening after ecdysis (Hickman et al. 2006). Although \n\nin most invertebrate taxa statocysts typically present a simple saclike appearance, in \n\ncephalopods they are more complex and show an amazingly close resemblance to \n\nvertebrate organs (e.g. semicircular canals in Octopus spp.) (Anken and Rahmann 2002). \n\nThe most evolved equilibrium sense organs definitively occur in vertebrates. Inner ears of \n\nvertebrates present three looping semicircular canals perpendicular to each other for the \n\ndetection of angular acceleration (or rotation of the head) plus three chamber containing \n\notoliths or statoconia in lower vertebrates (utricle, saccule and lagena for the perception \n\nof linear acceleration/gravity and sound) or two chambers with statoconia and a \n\nlagena/cochlea without a otolith or statoconia for sound perception in higher vertebrate \n\nanimals. In the above chambers there are patches of sensory and supportive cells called \n\nmacula. The macula is associated to underlying sensory neurons and in the opposite side \n\nhas a cupula that is made heavy by deposits of calcareous material: in fishes these \n\ndeposits can form a solid mass (the otolith) while in amphibians, reptiles, birds and \n\nmammals the deposits remain as hundreds of thousands minute calcium carbonate \n\ncristals (the statoconia or otoconia). When the head of the animal moves, the otoliths or \n\notoconia tend to slide over the macula in response to gravity, producing a force to which \n\nhair cells are sensitive and allow the detection of postural position and acceleration \n\n(Hildebrand 1974; Anken and Rahmann 2002). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nBesides the general interest that the above mentioned equilibrium sense organs \n\nmay represent for physiology, ethology, taxonomy and other areas of biological science, \n\nthe present dissertation aims to explore the usefulness of gastropod statoliths for \n\nsclerochronology. The sclerochronology is a field of science dedicated to the study of \n\nphysical and chemical variations in calcified structures of organisms (e.g.: fish otoliths, \n\nbones and scales, mollusc shells, corals, etc.) and the temporal context in which they \n\nform. It is central for age estimation and growth analysis in studies of biology and \n\nfisheries management, to deduce organism life history traits or to reconstruct records of \n\nenvironmental and climatic change through space and time. Barroso et al. (2005) \n\ndemonstrated that statoliths of adult gastropod molluscs can be used in \n\nsclerochronology. Based on samples collected from the seacoast of Aveiro (Portugal), \n\nthese authors showed that the gastropod species Nassarius reticulatus possesses two \n\nstatocysts, each containing a spherical statolith of calcium carbonate of up to 0.22 mm in \n\ndiameter that can provide information about the age and growth of this species. \n\nRichardson et al. (2005a, b) showed that the gastropods Neptunea antiqua and Polinices \n\npulchellus possessed similar statoliths that could be used for age determinations. Later, \n\nChatzinikolaou and Richardson (2007) corroborated the results obtained by Barroso et al. \n\n(2005) for N. reticulatus collected from United Kigdom seacoast. \n\nThe application of adult gastropod statoliths in sclerochronology is recent and may \n\npresent many advantages comparing to the most traditional organisms that have been \n\nused in marine sclerochronology such as fish, bivalves cephalopods and corals. One \n\nadvantadge is the fact that gastropods are sedentary or poorly mobile organisms, unlike \n\nfish or cephalopods, and so they can describe the physical-chemical composition of the \n\nmarine environment in a particular location along time. A second advantage is the fact \n\nthat, unlike the shells of bivalves or gastropods, the statoliths are internal structures that \n\nare protected from erosion and mechanical/chemical stress and so they can register \n\naccurately information on the marine environment and can also provide good age \n\nestimations. Many aspects are still unexplored in the literature, namely if statoliths can be \n\nuniversally used for describing the age and growth in class Gastropoda. This is important \n\nbecause in most gastropod species the outer shell surface has few rings that can be used \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nreliably for age estimation and their detection in the conical spired shells of gastropods is \n\ncomplicated without serial sectioning. The annual rings present in gastropod statoliths \n\nmay overcome these difficulties as demonstrated by Barroso et al. (2005), Richardson et \n\nal. (2005a, b) and Chatzinikolaou and Richardson (2007). In this dissertation it is \n\npretended to advance furthermore this topic with the attempt to relate the rings \n\nobserved in the statolith through visual/image analysis with the chemical analysis of the \n\nstatolith, assuming that seasonal variation of chemical fingerprints may provide a good \n\nvalidation of the observed annual rings. \n\nThe general objective of this thesis is to contribute to the advance of the \n\ntechniques in sclerochronology and to improve our understanding regarding the diversity \n\nand the microstructure of gastropod statolith. The specific objectives are: (i) to provide a \n\ncomprehensive characterization of the type, shape, microstructure and chemical \n\nconstitution of the statoliths in class Gastropoda, and to (ii) improve and expand the use \n\nof statoliths for age and growth assessments in class Gastropoda. The thesis is organised \n\nin four chapters. Chapter 1 (the current one) is the general introduction of the theme of \n\nthe thesis, where the main objectives of the work are defined. Chapter 2 characterizes \n\nthe diversity of statoliths that occur in different species of gastropods collected in Aveiro \n\n(NW Portugal) and the adjacent seacoast. Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition \n\nof statoliths of Nassarius reticulatus and addresses its usefulness for age determinations \n\nand environmental monitoring. Chapter 4 states the major conclusions of the current \n\nwork and prospects complementary work to be developed in the future. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n1.1 References \n\nAnken, R.

Introduction \n\nThe Mollusca is the second largest phylum of the kingdom Animalia and one of its \n\nmost diverse groups with about 200,000 living species (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). In \n\nterms of number of species, Gastropoda is considered the major class of Mollusca (80% of \n\nall molluscs are gastropods) due to the great evolutionary radiation suffered, and is also \n\nthe second largest class of the animal kingdom. This group is generally characterized by \n\nhaving a single shell, an operculum and a larvae undergoing torsion. Gastropods vary in \n\nexternal shape, size, behavior, anatomy and physiology, and show an almost global \n\ndistribution, from marine and freshwater to terrestrial environments (Campbell 2008; \n\nPonder and Lindberg 2008). \n\n \n\n2.1 .1 . Gas tropod systema tics  \n\nTo better understand the diversity of statocysts and statolith/statocconia in \n\ngastropods, it is first necessary to describe the biodiversity in class gastropoda and clarify \n\nthe taxonomic nomenclature here adopted.  The gastropods biodiversity has been \n\ntraditionally grouped into three subclasses \u2013 Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and \n\nPulmonata \u2013 following Milne-Edwards's (1848). Thiele (1929-31) (see Figure 3) adopted \n\nMilne-Edwards\u2019s (1848) classification but further subdivided the Prosobranchia into three \n\norders: Archaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda, and Stenoglossa (this last one renamed \n\nNeogastropoda by Wenz 1938-44) (Franc 1968; McArthur and Harasewych 2003).  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3. Gastropod classification after Thiele (1929-1931). The gastropod class was divided into three subclasses: \n\nProsobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata. The subclass Prosobranchia was divided into three orders: \n\nArchaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda and Neogastropoda. \n\n \n\nThis was until recently the main classification accepted and followed in most \n\ntextbooks. However, gastropods classification has evolved in the recent years due to: (i) \n\nthe discover of new taxa, especially in deep-sea environments; (ii) the rapid increase of \n\nnew data provided by new morphological and molecular techniques; and (iii) the \n\ndevelopment of new methodologies for data analysis and phylogenetic hypotheses \n\ngeneration (McArthur and Harasewych 2003; Ponder and Lindber 2008).  \n\nOne important change to the above classification (hereafter designated as \u201cold \n\nclassification\u201d) was proposed by Yonge\u2019s (1947) that divided the Aspidobranchia \n\n(prosobranchs with bipectinate ctenidia) into four groups: (i) true limpets (now described \n\nas Patellogastropoda), (ii) ancient marine snails (now described as Vetigastropoda), (iii) \n\ncaenogastropods and (iv) neritoideans. Although the position of these groups has \n\nchanged in the following years, the main contribution of this scheme was the recognition \n\nof the neritoideans (equivalent to Neritimorpha).  \n\nOther major modification to the old classification was proposed by Cox (1960) and \n\nconsisted in the unification of the mesogastropods and neogastropods into a new group \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nnamed Caenogastropoda, which now comprises about 60% of living gastropod species. In \n\nterms of rank, Cox (1960) treated Caenogastropoda as an order, while Ponder and \n\nLindberg (1997) (see below) and Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) (see below) treated \n\ncaenogastropods as an unranked major clade comprising the majority of the \n\nMesogastropoda of Thiele (1929\u20131931) and all of the Neogastropoda, whilst several \n\ngroups (Architectonicoidea, Rissoellidae, Omalogyridae, Pyramidellidae, Valvatidae) \n\npreviously included in Mesogastropoda are now included in Heterobranchia.  \n\nAnother important change to the old classification was the recognition made by \n\nGolikov and Starobogatov (1975) that the true limpets (now described as \n\nPatellogastropoda) represent a distinct group from the remaining gastropods. \n\nSubsequently, Ponder and Lindberg (1995) grouped the gastropods into two main \n\nsubclasses: (i) the Eogastropoda, that include the true limpets (Patellogastropoda) and \n\nancestors; and (ii) the Orthogastropoda that are split among the Vetigastropoda, \n\nCocciliniformia, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (the latter includes \n\nthe Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata)(see Figure 4).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4. Gastropoda classisifcation after Ponder and Lindberg 1995. The class Gastropoda was first divided into two \n\nmain divisions Eogastropoda (= Patellogastropoda), and Orthogastropoda. Orthogastropoda includes all the other \n\ngastropods. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nBouchet and Rocroi (2005) (see Figure 5) recognized the monophyly of the six \n\ngroups scheme of Ponder and Lindberg (1995) although they consider that there are no \n\nsynapomorphies that reliably group any of these lineages. These authors proposed slight \n\nchanges in this systematics, including the elimination of the split between Eogastropoda \n\nand Orthogastropoda as in Ponder and Lindberg (1997), and recognizes six main groups: \n\nPatellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Cocculiniformia, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda \n\n(which, in the initial classification, all together constituted the subclass Prosobranchia) \n\nand Heterobranchia (combining the previous Pulmonata and Opisthibranchia subclasses). \n\nIn the Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) classification the higher taxa are expressed as unranked \n\nclades, and groups where monophyly (a single lineage) is not proved are termed \n\n\"informal groups\". \n\n \nFigure 5. Gastropoda classification after Bouchet and Rocroi (2005). The class Gastropoda was divided into six \n\nmonophyletic groups. \n\nSubsequent revisions by other authors have been made since the publication of \n\nthe above paper but this dissertation will be based hereafter on the taxonomy proposed \n\nby Bouchet and Rocroi (2005), following the adaptations performed by Gofas (2011a) that \n\nare adopted in the official site of the World Register of Marine Species \n\n(www.marinesepecies.org). Main changes adopted by Gofas (2011a) on the Bouchet and \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nRocroi (2005) scheme consisted in adding Linnean ranks above superfamily in order to \n\nallow to follow hierarchical levels after a number of branchings and also to better \n\nquantify how deep diversification goes (Figures 5 and table 2). \n\n \n\n2.1 .2 . Location,  structur e and func tion of  gastropod statocys t  \n\n2.1 .2 .1 . Sta tocyst locat ion   \n\nGastropods statocysts are intimately connected to the nervous system. The \n\nnervous system structures, including pedal, pleural and cerebral ganglia, are connected \n\nand form a ring around the esophagus (Figure 6). \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Gastropod central nervous system (schematic dorsal view, not to scale). Cg: cerebral ganglion; E: \n\noesophagus; Ey: eye; Plg: pleural ganglion; Pg: pedal ganglion; S: statocyst. Adapted from Neusser et al. 2009. \n\nThe statocysts are intimately associated with the nervous ganglia (Fretter and \n\nGraham 1962) and frequently connected to the cerebral ganglia through a fine sensory \n\nnerve that runs alongside the cerebro-pedal connective nerve (Hyman 1967; Zaitseva \n\n1994; Balaban 2011). The statocyst nerve spreads over the surface of the vesicular wall \n\nand presumably terminates in sensory cells (Hyman 1967).  The precise location seems to \n\nvary from species to species as their description in the literature is rather variable. In \n\ninfraclass Pulmonata the statocyst is a transparent vesicle that can reach 480 \u00b5m and is \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nlocated in the cerebro-pedal connective nerves of pedal ganglia (Stahlschmidt and Wolff \n\n1972; Zaitseva and Bocharova 1981; Zaitseva 1994, 2001). However, according to Chase \n\net al. (2002) opisthobranchs and pulmonates have the statocysts located on the dorso-\n\nlateral surface close to the pleural ganglion, while in the remainder gastropods they are \n\nlocated on the ventral side of the pedal ganglia. The statocyst position in several \n\ngastropod species is described in table 1. \n\n  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nTable 1. Statocyst location in some gastropods species. \n\n \n\n2.1 .2 .2 .

The epithelium contains small supporting cells carrying microvilli and giant sensory \n\nhair cells (receptor cells) (Fretter and Graham 1962; Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Gao \n\nand Wiederhold 1997; Chase 2002; Tsirulis, 1974 in Levi et al. 2004). Gastropods can have \n\nreceptor cells type 1 (\u201cProsobranchs\u201d), type 2 (Opisthobranchs and Pulmonates) or both \n\ntypes (Opisthobranchs); receptor cells type 1 are morphologically polarized and have the \n\nbasal feet of the cilia project in the same direction; receptor cells type 2 are \n\nmorphologically nonpolarized, and the basal feet of the cilia of this hair cell are radially \n\noriented and are most often oriented centripetally with the cilia arranged in a ring (See \n\nSalley 1986). \n\nIn Opisthobranchia infraclass the statocyst diameter varies with the size of the \n\nanimal and may reach 200 \u00b5m (Wiederhold et al. 1989; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Zaitseva \n\n2001). Each statocyst contains 10\u201313 disk-shaped receptor cells (or mechanoreceptor \n\ncells (Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Pedrozo et al. 1996)), the number of receptor cells \n\nvaries from species to species in the Heterobranchia subclass (Ohsuga et al. 2000). The \n\nreceptor cells are separated from each other by layers of small supporting cells \n\n(Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Zaitseva 1994; Zaitseva \n\n2001). \n\nIn the caenogastropod Pomacea paludosa the statocyst can reach a diameter of \n\n400-450 \u00b5m and contain approximately 2500-3000 small receptor cells (Stahlschmidt and \n\nWolff 1972; Gao and Wiederhold 1997). Each receptor cell has 30-40 cilia and is \n\nsurrounded by 6 supporting cells (Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972). In gastropods, the \n\nreceptor cells carry (9+2)-type kinocilia with about 0,2 \u00b5m in diameter and 15-20 \u00b5m long \n\n(Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Mckee and Wierderhold 1974; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; \n\nBalaban et al. 2011). These cells send their axons into a nerve, called the \u201cstatic nerve\u201d or \n\nstatonerve, which connects to the cerebral ganglion (Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Mckee \n\nand Wiederhold 1974; Wiederhold et al. 1989; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Barker 2001; Zaitseva \n\n2001; Chase 2002; Campbell et al. 2008). The receptor cells cilia are in direct contact with \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nthe statocyst cavity (Zaitseva 2001). Statocysts contain inside the lumen a single statolith \n\nor statoconia (Balaban et al. 2011). Upon stimulation of cilia by statoliths or statoconia, \n\nthere are substances that are activated in specific locations in the statocyst, that function \n\nas statocysts sensory transmitters to the cerebral ganglia (see Ohsuga et al. 2000; Balaban \n\n2011). Electrophysiological studies conducted by Jance (1988) demonstrated that \n\ncatecholamines play an important role in the efferent innervation of statocyst by central \n\nnervous system neurons (Jance et al. 1988 in Zaitseva 2001). \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Statolith and Statoconia.

Scale bar 50\u00b5m. B: Interior wall of statocyst with \n\nthree statoconia and several cilia of Helix lucorum, extracted from Gorgiladze et al. 2010. Scale bar 10 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nThe gastropod statolith is generally a spherical mass of calcium carbonate. The \n\nstatolith is formed by the periodically deposition of increments (Franc 1968) and often \n\nshows concentric rings, perhaps due to rhythms in the animal\u2019s growth (Fretter and \n\nGraham 1962; Maggenti 2005) (see figure 7a). These rings have been used for age \n\nestimation in larvae (Grana-Rafucci and Appeldoorn 1997) and adult caenogastropods \n\n(Barroso et al. 2005, 2011; Richardson et al. 2005a, 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson \n\n2007). The statoconia is constituted by several smaller spherical masses also of calcium \n\ncarbonate (Figure 7b).  Vast majority of statoconia have an ellipsoidal shape in \n\nOpisthobranhia infraclass that can vary between 3-20 \u00b5m in Aplysia sp (Wiederhold et al. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n1989), and in Pulmonata infraclass have an oval shape structure and can vary between 2-\n\n3 \u00b5m in diameter (Gorgiladze et al. 2010). The statoconia have a central nucleus and the \n\nnumber of layers surrounding it increase with increasing statoconium size (statoconia \n\nwith an irregular form can have 2 nucleus) (Gorgiladze et al. 2010). In Aplysia sp., the \n\nanimals starts with a single statolith (in larval stage) and reaches up to 1000 statoconia in \n\nadult life. This indicates that statoconia are added to the cyst lumen during development \n\n(Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Wiederhold et al. 1989; Chase 2002).  \n\n \n\n2.1.2.3. Statocysts function \n\nThe statocyst of molluscs was first described as a sense organ, in 1887, by the \n\nFrench zoologist Yves Delage (Franc 1968). Subsequent experimental work carried out by \n\ndifferent researchers confirmed that statocysts are organs of balance allowing most of \n\nthe invertebrates to sense gravity and to maintain the equilibrium (Hyman 1967; Franc \n\n1968; Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Wierderhold 1989; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; \n\nMaggenti 2005; Campbell et al. 2008; Gorgiladze et al. 2010). Through behavioral \n\nexperiments, especially statocyst extirpation experiments, it was possible to discover that \n\nstatocysts of molluscs control various behavioural reactions, like geotaxis (Lever and \n\nGenze in Hyman 1967; Levi et al. 2004), maintenance of equilibrium (Morton 1979) and \n\ncompensatory reactions (Barker 2001; Zaitseva 2001; Levi et al. 2004). All these findings \n\nprove the ability of the statocyst to use gravitational stimuli to spatially orient the body \n\nwith respect to the vertical axis of gravity (Salley 1986). \n\nStatoliths and statoconia move freely inside the statocyst under the influence of \n\ngravity (Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Levi et al., 2004). Inside the statocyst the \n\ncontinuous beating of the mechanosensory cilia keeps the statoconia in constant motion \n\n(Pedrozo et al. 1996). Gravity pulls the statoconia down, obstructing the beating of the \n\ncilia on the bottom of the statocyst, which causes an increase in membrane conductance \n\nto Na+ and the formation of an action potential, generating a nervous signal and \n\nactivating the sensory cells (Wiederhold 1976; Gallin and Wiederhold 1977; Zaitseva \n\n1994; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Chase 2002). However, in gastropods, no response is given by \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\neither acceleration or deceleration, and the statocyst only senses the gravity direction \n\n(Chase 2002).  \n\nIn genus Aplysia the cerebral ganglia receive information from the statocyst to \n\nregulate body movement activity (Salsnki et al. cited in Zaitseva 2001). Wiederhold (1989) \n\ndescribed that the receptor cells of Aplysia sp. statocysts react to a tilted table, \n\ngenerating action potencials. These action potentials are carried by the statocyst nerve to \n\nthe cerebral ganglia in order to convey information about animal orientation (Gallin and \n\nWiederhold 1977; Wiederhold 1989). It is well established now that the response of \n\nreceptor cells with respect to gravity is what determines the spatial orientation in \n\ngastropods (Gao and Wiederhold 1997). Because of its relatively simple structure, the \n\nstatocyst of Heterobranchia subclass has been used as a model for zoology studies \n\nregarding the basic principles and interactions between the vestibular system and other \n\nsensory systems in vertebrates during the formation of adaptive behavior (Zaitseva 2001). \n\n \n\n2.1 .2 .4 . Sta tocyst on togeny  \n\nThe ontogeny and the mechanisms of elemental deposition of gastropods \n\nstatoliths and statoconia are still poorly known. It is consensual that statocysts are \n\nformed very soon during gastropod embryonic development and are functional in the \n\nbeginning of the larval stage.  \n\nLoyd (2008) reported that in the caenogastropod Kelletia kelleti the statocysts and \n\nrespective statoliths are formed approximately within the 2 weeks after egg capsules are \n\nlaid. D\u2019Asaro (1965) refer that in the caenogastropod Strombus gigas statocysts begin to \n\nform in \u201cfour day old\u201d embryos and are functional by day six. According to Muley (1978), \n\nthe two statocysts are the most striking features in the trochophore stage (origin of \n\ndifferent organs and organ system can be traced from this stage). However, in N. lapillus \n\n(caenogastropod), the statocysts appears in the beginning of the veliger stage (Muley \n\n1978; St\u00f6ckmann-Bosbach 1988; Dickinson and Croll 2003). Then, the statocysts lie close \n\nto the pleural-pedal ganglia though they are innervated by nerves from the cerebral \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nganglia (Fretter and Graham 1962). In none of these works, on N. lapillus, is referred \n\nwhen the statocyst start to develop a statolith.  \n\nIn the opisthobranch Aplysia sp. statocysts arise 10 days after fertilization, when \n\nthe animals hatch (Wiederhold 1989). However, Bidwell et al. (1986) described the \n\npresence of a statolith in normal 5 day embryos (Bidwell et al. 1986 cited in Wiederhold \n\n1989) \n\n Gorgiladze et al. (2010) refer that the statoconia in the pulmonate Helix lucorum \n\nare formed by deposition of growth layers of mineral and organic materials. These \n\nauthors found inside the statocyst, apart from statoconia, spherical formations between \n\nkinocilia with only 0.3-2.5 \u00b5m in diameter that may correspond to the nuclei of future \n\nstatoconia. Afterwards, the supporting cells secrete the mineral component that \n\nsediments in the form of growth layers around the nuclei (Gorgliladze et al. 2010). \n\nThere are some substances known to be required for the statolith and statoconia \n\nproduction. Pedrozo et al. (1996) suggest that urease and carbonic anhydrase are \n\nrequired for statoconia formation and that they are important for regulation of statocyst \n\npH in cultured statocysts (Pedrozo et al. 1996). Campbell and Speeg (1969) proposed that \n\nammonia, produced as a consequence of urease activity, can facilitate the biological \n\ndeposition of calcium carbonate by acting as a proton acceptor (Campbell and Speeg \n\n1969; Pedrozo et al. 1996). Strontium is also required to obtain normal development of \n\nmolluscan statoconia (Wiederhold et al. 1989).  \n\nThe statocysts ontogeny in the opisthobranchs is quite different from other \n\ngastropods because in this group larvae presents a single statolith in the statocyst whilst \n\nadults possess multiple statoconia (McKee and Wiederhold 1974; Chia et al. 1981; \n\nWiederhold 1989; Wiederhold et al. 1990. The statolith is retained till the metamorphosis \n\nand afterwards statoconia begin to be produced (Wiederhold, 1974;  Wiederhold  et  al. \n\n1986).This indicates that statoconia are added to the cyst lumen during development \n\n(Wiederhold 1989). Statoconia production reaches the highest level immediately after \n\nmetamorphosis and then it slows down throughout the rest of animals\u2019s life (Wiederhold  \n\net  al. 1990).  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Objectives \n\nThe main objective of this chapter is to describe the diversity of statoliths and \n\nstatoconia among several aquatic and terrestrial gastropod species collected in Aveiro \n\n(NW Portugal). Besides the general interest in comparing these structures between \n\ndifferent species, namely in what regards to their size and external appearance, the \n\nultimate goal is to inspect the clearness of the rings they may possess and their potential \n\ninterest for sclerochronology studies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n2.3 .1  Statocon ia vs  stato li ths: the d iversity  wi thin c lass gastropoda  \n\nSamples of marine gastropods were collected by hand in Ria de Aveiro (Aplysia sp, \n\nCalliostoma zizyphinum, Crepidula fornicata, Gibulla cineraria, Gibulla umbilicallis, \n\nLittorina littorea, Monodonta lineata, Nassarius incrassatus, Nucella lapillus, Ocenebra \n\neinacea, Ocinebrina aciculata, Trivia monacha  at Praia da Barra, 40\u00ba 31\u2019 05.90\u201d N 8\u00ba 47\u2019 \n\n05.11\u201d W; Hydrobia ulvae at Gafanha da Nazar\u00e9 40\u00ba 37\u2019 16.43\u201d N 8\u00ba 44\u2019 14.69\u201d W) in \n\nNovember 2009, March 2010, and September 2011, during the low tide; species from \n\ngenus Helix terrestrial gastropods were collected in March 2011 in a garden (Santa Joana \n\n40\u00ba 37\u201940.45\u2019\u2019 N 8 \u00ba 37\u201925.18\u2019\u2019 W). Aporrhais pespelecani, Charonia lampas, Nassarius \n\nreticulatus and Ranela olearium were obtained from the seacoast of Aveiro (10-30 m \n\ndepth) in sampling surveys performed in 2006 and 2010 preserved frozen (-20\u00baC) \n\nthereafter. Specimens were frozen in the following 3-4 hours after collection and kept at -\n\n20\u00b0 till further analysis. Upon thawing, the shells were photographed and measured. The \n\nsoft body of the animals was extracted from the shell. The anterior ventral surface of the \n\nbody was dissected under a stereo-microscope to locate the statocysts. The statocysts \n\nwere gently ruptured and the statoliths were removed with forceps. Statoliths were \n\nplaced in a supersaturated NaOH solution for 3h. Subsequently, they were washed twice \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nin destilled water, and then dehydrated, first in ethanol 70% and then in 100%. The \n\nstatoliths were then mounted in a glass slide with Eukit\u00ae resin. The statoliths were \n\nphotographed under an optical microscope with a microscope camera (Motic 2300\u00ae). \n\n \n\n2.3 .2  Statocys ts location  and struc ture  \n\nIn order to observe the microscopic structure of the statocyst, we selected one \n\ngastropod species \u2013 Nassarius reticulatus - to perform histological preparations of this \n\norgan. Specimens were narcotized and afterwards the shells were cracked to remove the \n\nsoft body. The tissues envolving the statocysts were extracted and were fixed in Bouin\u2019s \n\nsolution for 24h. A total of seven pairs of statocysts (obtained from seven animals) were \n\nembedded in paraffin, sectioned (7 \u00b5m) in a microtome (Leitz 1512, Wetzlar, Germany), \n\nstained with haematoxylin\u2013eosin and mounted on a glass slide with EUKIT resin for light \n\nmicroscope observation. \n\n \n\n2.3 .3  Stato lith  morphology and onto logy  \n\nSo as to know more about the gastropod statolith ontogeny, one gastropod \n\nspecies Nucella lapillus (Linnaeus) was selected. Thus, in the laboratory, the embryonic \n\ndevelopment of these whelks was followed, from the capsule deposition to juvenile \n\nhatching, in order to define the moment when statocysts form and to study the \n\nrespective morphology of the statolith. For that we collected adults of N. lapillus from \n\nPraia da Barra and placed them in aquaria with artificial seawater (Prodac\u00ae) of 35 \n\npractical salinity units (psu), under constant aeration and at 18\u00ba C, for female spawning. \n\nEvery day egg-capsules were removed from the aquaria and kept under the same \n\nconditions but separated by date. Once a week, capsules were opened, using a scalpel, \n\nand embryonic development was observed with a stereo-microscope and photographed \n\nwith a digital camera (Moticam\u00ae 2300) adapted to the light microscope. \n\nIn complement, N. lapillus of different sizes were collected in a sheltered beach \n\n(Mar\u00e9grafo, Aveiro) in September 2011 and in an exposed beach (Costa Nova, Aveiro) in \n\nNovember 2011. In the laboratory the shells were measured and the statoliths were \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nremoved from animals and prepared as described above. The statoliths were \n\nphotographed with the digital camera (Moticam\u00ae 2300) adapted to the light microscope \n\nand all dimensions measured through image analysis using the Motic Images Plus 2.0\u00ae \n\nsoftware. \n\n \n\n2.4. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n2.4 .1 . Sta toconia vs s tatol iths:  the  diversi t y with in c lass gastropoda  \n\n  \n\nWe collected 19 gastropod species from marine, freshwater and terrestrial \n\nenvironment. A wide diversity of taxonomic groups could be sampled, covering 4 \n\nsubclasses and 13 families: subclass Patellogastropoda (Family Patellidae), subclass \n\nVetigastropoda (Families Calliostomatidae and Trochidae), subclass Caenosgastropoda \n\n(Families Calyptraeidae, Littorinidae, Hydrobiidae, Aporrhaidae, Ranellidae, Triviidae, \n\nNassariidae and Muricidae,) and subclass Heterobranchia (infraclass Opisthobranchia, \n\nfamily Aplysiidae; infraclass Pulmonata, family Helicidae). The 19 gastropod species \n\ncollected in this work are shown in figures 8-27 and their taxonomic position is listed in \n\ntable 2.The taxonomic diversity of gastropods sampled in Aveiro, although relatively short \n\nin number of species, is reasonable good to represent the main trends in statocyst \n\ndiversity in class gastropoda considering that it includes 4 of the main 6 clades of Bouchet \n\nand Rocroi (2005).  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.

It should be noted however that, according to Hess et al. \n\n(2008), subclasses Cocculiniforma and Neritimorpha (not analyzed in this work) have a \n\nsingle statolith.  \n\nOur findings also match the morphological criteria used to distinguish the \n\nhypsogastropoda that, among other diagnostic characters, present a single statolith in \n\neach statocyst rather than several statoconia (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). The \n\n\u201chypsogastropoda\u201d was a term introduced by Ponder and Lindberg (1997) to include the \n\n\u201chigher caenogastropods\u201d of Healy (1988a), i.e., the great majority of extant \n\ncaenogastropods (most \u201cmesogastropods\u201d and all neogastropods) or, in other words, all \n\ncaenogastropods other than architaenioglossans, Cerithioidea, and Campaniloidea. This is \n\nin general accordance with the criteria defined by Fretter and Graham (1962) in the sense \n\nthat these authors also exclude the Viviparidae (architaenioglossans) from the meso- and \n\nneogastropods as an exception for the statolith type, i.e., animals that possess statoconia \n\ninstead of a single statolith. \n\nIt seems that the presence of statoconia vs statolith could be used as a main \n\ndistinguishing feature in gastropods classification. A clearly a distinction between \n\nsubclasses Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda and Heterobranchia, altogether presenting \n\nstatoconia, and the Caenogastropoda, presenting statoliths, is evident in figure 24.  \n\nThough useful for systematics, we should avoid making for now any inference regarding \n\nthe evolution history of statocysts in class gastropoda because it would be surprising to \n\nobserve statoconia in heterobranchs and statoliths in caenogastropods. In fact, this \n\ncharacter (statoconia vs statolith) could represent an important drawback to the \n\nhypothesis that consider these two subclasses as sister groups. Although Heterobranchia \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nhas been regarded to be the sister group of Caenogastropoda by many paleontologists, \n\nsome evidence suggests this may not be true (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). In fact, it has \n\nbeen difficult to construct a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for gastropod evolution as \n\nrelationships among major gastropod clades vary significantly among analyses based on \n\nmorphological and molecular data sets (see Aktipis et al. 2008). Other interesting aspect \n\nis that opisthobranchs show the peculiar feature of exhibiting a single statolith within \n\neach statocyst during the larval stage and multiple statoconia afterwards (Wiederhold et \n\nal. 1990; Chase 2002). Although this aspect deserves more study, we cannot reject the \n\nhypothesis that the statolith observed in the larval stage can in fact represent a single \n\nstatoconium that evolves to a condition of multiple statoconia during ontogeny. \n\nRegardless the usefulness of using the statoconia vs statolith criteria for diagnostic \n\nproposals, phylogenetic interpretations or taxonomic rearrangements, one pragmatic \n\nconclusion of interest is that only statoliths have potential for sclerochronology and, \n\nconsequently, only the higher caenogastropods (Hypsogastropoda) are of relevance in \n\nthis respect. In fact, it does not seem reliable to use each single statoconium to track the \n\npassage of time if more and more are being continuously produced throughout gastropod \n\nlive. In this sense, only the statolith can register a continuous passage of time since the \n\nbirth of the animal untill the moment it stops growing. The remaining shelled gastropods \n\ncan still be used for sclerochronology studies but only through the use of their shells. \n\n \n\n2.4 .2 . Sta tocysts  locat ion and s tructure  \n\nThe statocysts are transparent organs and it is possible to see where they are \n\nlocated due to the disctint presence of the statoliths or statoconia. The gastropods \n\nanalysed presented statocysts close to the nervous ganglia but, as expected, in different \n\npositions depending on the species. For instance, in N. reticulatus (see figure 28) \n\nstatocysts are close to the pedal ganglia, while in Patella sp, C. zizyphinum and Aplysia sp \n\n(see Figure 29, 30 and 31, respectively ) statocysts are between the pedal and the pleural \n\nganglia, but closer to the pedal ganglia. In Helix sp statocysts are located on the side of \n\nthe pedal ganglia (Figure 32). \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28. Nassarius reticulatus.

In fact, it is possible \n\nto observe two cells layers, in the interior of the cyst (Figure 33a and 33b), but it is not \n\npossible to identify the cells types (receptor and supporting cells) nor the cilia. Figure 30a \n\nshows the N. reticulatus statocyst without the statolith as it was removed by the \n\nmicrotome knife during cutting. The N. reticulatus statocyst with a statolith is shown in \n\nfigure 30b. This statolith has been cut and this is just a part (less than a half) of the \n\nstatolith. A statocyst with a statolith in figure 33c, but in this case a fresh unfixed and \n\nunstained preparation was made and photographed immediately after extraction from \n\nthe animal where it can be observed the round structure and the transparency of the \n\nstatocyst.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33.

Sta tol ith morphology and  ontology  \n\n \n\nAs shown in figures 15-25 the morphology of statoliths is quite similar among the \n\ndifferent species of Caenogastropoda. All of them have a more or less spherical shape and \n\nexihbit a hard translucent structure. As they are transparent it is possible to perceive the \n\nexistence of several concentric layers of material that seems to be secreted with a given \n\npattern during the animal\u2019s live. These concentric layers are noticed in almost all \n\nstatoliths (Figures 14-25) and, when observed in one dimension, they appear like a series \n\nof rings that can putatively result from a discontinuous growth rate of the animal. \n\nBetween these conspicuous major rings it is possible to observe other tiny and smaller \n\nrings that apparently are formed by progressive deposition of calcareous and organic \n\nmaterial during growth. If any of these rings result from annual, monthly, fortnightly or \n\neven daily increments of time induced by environmental and astronomical pacemakers, it \n\nis possible to use them to trace the passage of time, and here resides their potential value \n\nfor sclerochronology. \n\nIn order to better understand the growth and morphology evolution of the \n\nstatolith, we followed the statolith development in one selected caenogastropod - N. \n\nlapillus \u2013 during the larval stage (retained in the egg capsule) and in adult live. N. lapillus \n\nis a predatory gastropod abundant and widespread on rocky shores in the North Atlantic. \n\nN.lapillus is dioecious, laying benthic capsules that each contains 15\u201330 shelled embryos. \n\nCrawling young emerge from the capsules and, as in other gastropods with direct \n\ndevelopment, the limited dispersal capability is correlated with pronounced spatial \n\nvariability in shell morphology (Rol\u00e1n et al.2004; Guerra-Varela et al. 2009; Galante-\n\nOliveira et al. 2011).  \n\nIt has been reported that the period between egg capsule deposition and juvenile \n\nhatching in this species may last about 4 months (Fretter and Graham 1962; St\u00f6ckmann-\n\nBosbach 1988; Pechenik et al. 1984). The embryos were observed once a week, but only \n\nin the 3rd week (after egg-capsule deposition) was possible to observe the statolith (Figure \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n34d). It was not possible to distinguish the organs that have developed in the embryos \n\nbetween the first and second week (Figure 34a and 34b, respectively) by direct \n\nmicroscope observation. In the 3rd week the statolith presented 3 rings (Figure 34d), \n\nwhich indicates that it was formed some time before, perhaps in the beginning of the \n\nsecond week. This has been confirmed for other caenogastropod, Kelletia kelleti (Loyd et \n\nal. 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34. Nucella lapillus ontogeny. A: Capsule with embryos in the first day. B: Capsule with embryos in the \n\nbeginning of 2nd week. C: Embryo in the veliger stage. D: statolith of an embryo with 24 days. \n\nThe monitoring of the continuous development of the statolith beyond the \n\njuvenile stage and up to the adult live would take a number of years, so we decided to \n\nanalyze statoliths from a wide range of animal sizes in order to cover different ages. By \n\nthis way it was possible to follow the growth of the animals (along the different cohorts) \n\nat both sampling sites (Mar\u00e9grafo and Costa Nova), although the age could not be \n\nestimated. N. lapillus is known by presenting a polymorphism associated with the degree \n\nof wave exposure: exposed ecotypes are typically small, with relatively larger apertures \n\nand thinner shells than the sheltered ecotypes. In some localities the sheltered/exposed \n\npolymorphism reaches its maximum distinctness in sub-adults and then decreases with \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nageing, probably because adults undergo shell erosion (Rol\u00e1n et al.2004; Guerra-Varela et \n\nal. 2009). Despite the specific ecotype of this specie, no difference was found in the \n\nstatolith between animals in these sites (Mar\u00e9grafo and Costa Nova). We conclude that \n\nthe morphology and external appearance of the statolith remained almost constant \n\nthroughout the live of the whelks in what regards to the shape and occurrence of rings. \n\nThe diameter of the statoliths increased with shell size (see figure 35) and the number of \n\nrings augmented proportionally. The same pattern was already reported for N. reticulatus \n\ncollected from Aveiro by Barroso et al. (2005). This result confirms that the statolith \n\nincrement follows the growth of the animal throughout life and may probably provide an \n\nimportant register of physical and chemical characteristics of the marine environment \n\nthroughout ontogeny. They could thus serve as a tool for age estimation in N. lapillus as \n\nwell as a possible archive of the environmental conditions that the whelks experienced \n\nthrough lifespan at a given site.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35 Nucella lapillus. Stn.A: Mar\u00e9grafo. Stn.B: Costa Nova. The two first points indicates the statolith size with \n\n59 and 77 day of life. The line was adjusted visually and may not represent the real trend between the left (early \n\ndevelopment inside capsules) and right points (animals collected in the field). (*) indicates the time to hatch (approx. \n\non 65th day). \n\nThe statoliths of the diverse caenogastropods species collected in Ria de Aveiro \n\nappear to have the potential to be used in sclerochronology studies as: (i) they are easy to \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\ncollect; (ii) they grow along the animals life and form in the beginning of ontogeny; and \n\n(iii) they present a hard structure that may register the history of the animal throughout \n\ntime. It is particularly interesting to note that they present rings that could be used to \n\nestimate the age of animals if they are produced with a given periodicity. For instance, if \n\neach ring observed in the statolith corresponds to the change of growth rate during every \n\nwinter, their count could easily indicate the age of the gastropods in years. Most \n\nimportantly, when the statolith is grinded to the centre it reminds a \u201cmusic CD\u201d. If any \n\nanalytical technique could analyse the chemical composition of the statolith along the \n\nradius (from the center to the edge) perhaps we could detect and validate the number of \n\nrings if they correspond to seasonal variation of growth and confirm age. If \n\nbioaccumulation rate is taken into account it could be even possible to trace temporal \n\nevolution of environmental levels of given contaminants at a given site, which would \n\nrepresent a milestone to environmental monitoring science. Hence, after this preliminary \n\napproach to understand the diversity and general characteristics of statocysts and \n\nstatoliths in class gastropoda, it is important to advance and explore new techiques that \n\ncould allow the chemical analysis of the gastropod statolith, which is the subject of the \n\nnext chapter. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n2.5 References \n\n \n\nAktipis, S.

Introduction  \n\nStatoliths are diverse amongst the Gastropoda class, namely regarding type, shape \n\nand microstructure, see chapter 2. These features have been addressed over time, mainly \n\nas part of studies on statocysts structure (e.g. McKee and Wiederhold 1974; Chia et al. \n\n1981; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; Gorgiladze et al. 2010), development (e.g. D'Asaro \n\n1965; Salley 1986; Wiederhold et al. 1990; Gao et al. 1997) and function (e.g. McKee and \n\nWiederhold 1974; Gallin and Wiederhold 1977; Wiederhold et al. 1989). However, the \n\nscenario is different regarding statoliths chemical composition and hardly any reports, \n\nspecifically on gastropods, can be found in the literature. \n\n \n\n3.2. The gastropod statolith mineral matrix \n\n \n\n There are few studies on gastropods statoliths chemical composition and the \n\navailable ones refer to a minority of species \u2013 statoconia in Helix lucorum (Gorgiladze \n\n2002) and Aplysia californica (Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1997) \u2013 and mostly in \n\nlarvae \u2013 statoliths in Strombus gigas (Salley 1986), Concholepas concholepas (Zacherl et \n\nal. 2003a) and Kelletia kelletii (Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008). \n\nGenerally, a mineral matrix of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is referred for both statoconia \n\nand statoliths but its crystalline form as aragonite was only effectively tested for Helix \n\nlucorum (Gorgiladze 2002) and Aplysia californica (Pedrozo et al. 1997), both species \n\npresenting statoconia in adult life. However, embryonic and pre-metamorphic Aplysia \n\ncontain a single statolith within each statocyst, evolving to statoconia during juvenile \n\nstage (Wiederhold et al. 1990). In this particular case, Pedrozo and co-authors (1997) \n\nshowed that statolith and statoconia differ regarding crystalline composition: statoconia \n\nwere proved to be aragonitic while statoliths were apparently of amorphous CaCO3. \n\nDespite this unique record, the assumption of an aragonitic matrix in statoliths is patent \n\n(Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997; Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n2005; Lloyd et al. 2008) possibly because the data on statoconia are on that direction \n\n(Pedrozo et al. 1997; Gorgiladze 2002) but also since detailed descriptions on the \n\nchemical composition of analogous structures are available in the literature and show the \n\npresence of aragonite crystals (For cephalopod statoliths composition see Radtke 1983; \n\nsee the comprehensive revision on fish otoliths by Campana 1999). \n\n Regarding elemental composition, the gastropod statolith is known to be \n\ndominated by the major chemical elements calcium (Ca), carbon (C) and oxygen (O) \n\n(Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1997; Gorgiladze 2002; Barroso et al. 2005b), as \n\nexpected because of the CaCO3 matrix. Nevertheless, the presence of minor (>100ppm) \n\nand trace (<100ppm) elements have been plainly reported for Aplysia californica \n\n(Wiederhold et al. 1989), Helix lucorum (Gorgiladze 2002), Strombus gigas (Salley 1986), \n\nConcholepas concholepas (Zacherl et al. 2003a) and Kelletia kelletii (Zacherl et al. 2003b; \n\nZacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008), (see Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3. Summary of the records found in literature for minor and trace elements detected in statoconia and \n\nstatoliths. Elements are presented by species and respective references are also indicated. \n\nSpecies Elements References \n\nAplysia californica Cl, Mg, Na, Sr, S \nWiederhold et al. \n\n(1989) \n\nHelix lucorum Cl, K, Si, Na, S Gorgiladze (2002) \n\nStrombus gigas Cl, Mg, Na, P, S Salley (1986) \n\nConcholepas \n\nconcholepas \nBa/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca, Zn/Ca \n\nZacherl et al. \n\n(2003a) \n\nKelletia kelletii Ba/Ca, Sr/Ca \nZacherl et al. \n\n(2003b) \n\n \n\nBa/Ca, Ce/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/ Ca, Pb/Ca, \n\nSr/Ca, Zn/Ca \nZacherl (2005) \n\n \n\nBa/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca, \n\nZn/Ca \nLloyd et al. (2008) \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n Small but significant amounts of chlorine (Cl), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), \n\nstrontium (Sr) and sulfur (S) were reported as minor elements of A. californica statoconia \n\nby Wiederhold et al. (1989); no absolute values are indicated but the authors determined \n\na Ca/Sr ratio of 97:1 \u00b1 3 (mean \u00b1 standard error). Chlorine, potassium (K), Na, S and silicon \n\n(Si) ranged from 0.1 to 0.7% of the total weight fractions (1000 to 7000 ppm) in H. \n\nlucorum statoconia (Gorgiladze 2002). Chlorine, Mg, Na, phosphorous (P) and S were also \n\ndetected in the inner matrix of a 0-10 days larval statolith of S. gigas (Salley 1986). Zacherl \n\net al. (2003a) measured barium (Ba), lead (Pb), Sr and zinc (Zn) in Concholepas \n\nconcholepas larva, presenting the results as element/Ca ratios, as it was also performed \n\nfor Kelletia kelletii larva by: (i) Zacherl et al. (2003b) for Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios; (ii) Zacherl \n\n(2005) for Ba/Ca, cerium (Ce)/Ca, Mg/Ca, manganese (Mn)/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca; \n\nand (iii) Lloyd et al. (2008) for Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca. Thus, in \n\nsummary and to date, the following elements were detected in gastropods statoconia \n\nand statoliths: Ba, C, Ca, Ce, Cl, K, Mg, Mn, Na, O, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr and Zn. \n\n \n\n3.3. Objectives \n\nThe objective of this chapter is to characterize Nassarius reticulatus statolith \n\nelemental composition by using the Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) technique. \n\nEMPA is a non-destructive approach for determining the chemical composition of \n\ncomplex solid materials (Castaing 1960) and proved to be the best method to accurately \n\nmeasure the most representative elements in fish otoliths (Campana et al. 1997). For this \n\nreason, it was used in the present work to characterise the general statolith elemental \n\ncomposition in N. reticulatus adults and by this way to perform a preliminary assessment \n\nregarding the possibility to: (i) detect annual growth rings that could be used to estimate \n\nthe age of the animals; (ii) search for trace metal contamination that could be \n\nsubsequently applied in environmental monitoring. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n3.3 Material and methods \n\nOne statolith from each of three adult specimens of Nassarius reticulatus were \n\nused to determine statolith elemental composition in this species by EPMA. Two animals, \n\nsampled at Aveiro seacoast (40\u00b038\u201950\u2019\u2019N 8\u00b047\u201908\u2019\u2019W), provided statoliths S.1 and S.2. One \n\nmore specimen, collected inside Ria de Aveiro estuarine system (40\u00b030\u201939.26\u2019\u2019N \n\n8\u00b044\u201955.64\u2019\u2019W), provided statolith S.3. After sampling, animals were frozen and kept at -\n\n20\u00b0C until further processing. Statoliths were extracted from thawed specimens, as \n\ndescribed in chapter 2. In order to digest any remaining flesh tissue from the statocyst, \n\neach statolith was placed on a single concave glass slide and immersed in a drop of \n\nsaturated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) during three hours. Then, NaOH was completely \n\nremoved and substituted by distilled water. This washing step was repeated twice and \n\nfollowed by two similar steps for dehydration: at first by immersion in 70% ethanol and \n\nthen in 100% ethanol. Afterwards, glass slides containing statoliths were placed inside an \n\noven at 60\u00b0C to dry for about 5 minutes. \n\n Dried statoliths were embedded in resin (EpoFix kit from Struers) and mounted in \n\nplain glass slides whose surface was previously sanded, washed with detergent, rinsed \n\nabundantly with water and cleaned with absolute ethanol, in order to increase adhesion \n\nof resin to glass. The resin was prepared by mixing the 2 constituents of the EpoFix kit in \n\nthe proportion 8 EpoFix resin : 1 EpoFix hardener. To get rid of air bubbles formed while \n\nmixing, the resin was kept for 2 minutes inside an oven at 60\u00b0C and then left standing at \n\nroom temperature for 15 minutes. After that, a drop of resin was gently deposited on \n\neach glass slide and each statolith was positioned inside the resin and left at room \n\ntemperature to polymerize for at least 24 hours. Subsequently, all statoliths were \n\nphotographed under a light optical microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a camera \n\n(Moticam2300) and their maximum diameter measured. \n\n EPMA requires the exposure of the statolith center to the surface. So, the resin \n\nwas sanded with Silicon carbide powder p1000 in water, always controlling the statolith \n\nmaximum diameter under the microscope so it does not pass its center. Once achieved \n\nthe center, the statolith surface was washed with distilled water and dried with 100% \n\nethanol. Then, the surface was polished on a Planopol grinder polisher (Struers), holding \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nthe glass slide with the hand and pressuring the surface being polished to the rotating \n\ncloth on the equipment at 75 rpm. Different diamond polishing pastes (DP-Pastes from \n\nStruers) were used, decreasing in grain (6\u00b5m, 1\u00b5m and \u00bc\u00b5m) in order to obtain a \n\ncompletely plain, light and bright surface for the EPMA. Each polishing paste was added \n\nto the respective Planopol cloth (one for each paste) and each statolith was polished \n\nduring 3 to 4 minutes. A lubricant solution was also added to each cloth to avoid statoliths \n\ncracking and breaking. To remove pastes residues between different grains, glass slides \n\nwere cleaned with 96% ethanol. At the end of the polishing process, glass slides were not \n\nonly cleaned with 96% ethanol but also degreased by sonication in analytical grade \n\nethanol for 15 minutes and then placed inside an oven at 40\u00b0C to dry for 5 minutes. \n\n Perfectly polished, cleaned and bright statoliths were then metalized with carbon \n\natoms (by vaporization) to guarantee the material electrical conductivity, and afterwards \n\nanalysed by EMPA. In summary, this technique consists in projecting a finely focused \n\nelectron beam (electron probe), of a diameter less than 1 \u00b5m, onto the point of the solid \n\nsurface whose chemical composition is to be examined. Subsequently, the very small \n\nvolume of material irradiated (<1\u00b5m3) emits a complex X-ray spectrum which includes the \n\ncharacteristic radiations of the various elements present at that point. Spectrographic \n\nanalysis of this X-ray spectrum allows the respective concentrations of these elements to \n\nbe determined (Castaing 1960).  EMPA analysis was performed in a JEOL 8500-F electron \n\nprobe microanalyser. This equipment is outfitted with 5 Wavelength Dispersive \n\nSpectrometers and has installed 12 analyzing crystals (PET, TAP, LIF and LDEs) that cover \n\nthe whole spectrum from Beryllium (Z=4) to Uranium (Z=92). For rapid qualitative analysis \n\nit has also installed a high sensitivity SDD type Energy Dispersive Spectrometer. Chemical \n\ncomposition is determined by comparing the intensity of X-rays (number and \n\nenergy/wavelength) from standards of known composition with those from unknown \n\nmaterials, correcting for the effects of atomic number, absorption and fluorescence in the \n\nsample using CITZAF correction program (Armstrong Program). The protocol for analysis \n\nwas as follows. \n\n Initially, the general composition of the sample was assessed by the Energy \n\nDispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDS) acquired at 15kV, of a significant area of the statolith \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nexposed surface. This energy was chosen in order to have excited K? lines of heavier \n\nelements. To improve resolution, a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectra (WDS) were also \n\nobtained under the same conditions. The spectra revealed the presence of major and \n\nminor elements that were then included in the analysis program. Before analysis, a \n\nbackscattered electron image (COMP image) was acquired at 10kV and 10nA with the \n\nsame conditions as the quantitative analysis. Whenever possible, 3 analyses (3 points) by \n\nincrement were performed, including the statolith nucleus. The analytical conditions for \n\nthe quantitative analysis involved an acceleration voltage of 10kV, a beam current of \n\n10nA and a beam diameter of 1\u00b5m. Line profiles for those elements along the statolith \n\nradius were also performed, searching for the occurrence of periodical cycles. These line \n\nprofiles were carried out at an acceleration voltage of 15kV and a beam current of 20nA. \n\n As Ba has been described as a trace element in statoliths of some gastropods \n\nlarvae (Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008), useful \n\nas a natural tag to track larval dispersal, its occurrence was also sought in one of the \n\nNassarius reticulatus (L.) statoliths (S.3). In addition, some metallic elements \u2013 aluminium \n\n(Al), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg) and tin (Sn) \u2013 known to be environmental pollutants and \n\nso potentially capable of being deposited in statoliths, were also assessed in S.3. In these \n\ncases, longer measurement times (100s), an acceleration voltage of 10Kv and a higher \n\nbeam current of 30nA were applied. \n\n The standards used for quantitative analyses were: orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) for Al, \n\nbarite (BaSO4) for Ba, calcite (CaCO3) for Ca, cuprite (Cu2O) for Cu, cinnabar (HgS) for Hg, \n\npericlase (MgO) for Mg, albite (NaAlSi3O8) for Na, pyrite (FeS2) for S, cassiterite (SnO2) for \n\nSn and tausonite (SrTiO3) for Sr. As elements were determined as oxides, O \n\nconcentrations were calculated by subtraction. \n\n \n\n3.4 Results and discussion \n\n As mentioned in chapter 2, statoliths are typically spherical and exhibit a set of \n\nconcentric layers deposited around a nucleus. In N. reticulatus this nucleus is produced \n\nduring embryonic life and its formation is completed by the appearance of the \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nmetamorphic ring at larval settlement (Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and \n\nRichardson 2007). Thus, the term \u2018ring\u2019 refers to the dark segment of a bipartite structure \n\ncalled increment (Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), which in fact corresponds to a \n\nlight band together with the adjacent dark ring. These increments are repeatedly \n\ndeposited around the nucleus, generating the statolith typical pattern, as can be observed \n\nin COMP images of Figures 36A to 36C for S.1 to S.3, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36.  Nassarius reticulatus. COMP image showing general aspect of S.1 (A), S.2 (B), S.3 (C), indicating visible \n\nrings (MR, R1, R2, R3 and R4) and increments (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), from the nucleus (N) to the statolith edge. MR: \n\nMetamorphic ring; R1: First ring; R2: Second ring; R3: Third ring; R4: Fourth ring; N: Nucleus; 1: First increment; 2: \n\nSecond increment; 3: Third increment; 4: Fourth increment; 5: Fifth increment. \n\n \n\nAll statoliths analysed show the same structural pattern: there is a nucleus \n\ndelimited by a metamorphic ring (MR) and, in addition to this core, four other rings are \n\nobserved (R1, R2, R3 and R4). Thus, the nucleus (N) is surrounded by 5 increments: \n\nincrement \u201c1\u201d from the MR to R1; increment \u201c2\u201d from R1 to R2; increment \u201c3\u201d from R2 to \n\nR3; increment \u201c4\u201d from R3 to R4; increment \u201c5\u201d from R4 to the statolith edge (see Figure \n\n36). \n\n Energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS in Figure 37 and WDS in \n\nFigure 38) confirmed C, Ca and O as major elements in Nassarius reticulatus statoliths, \n\ncorroborating the reported by other authors (Barroso et al. 2005b). Furthermore, the \n\nspectra also revealed the presence of some minor elements, namely: Mg, Na, S and Sr. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWorth mentioning that spectra did not indicate the presence of Cl, as mentioned \n\nfor Aplysia californica statoconia (Wiederhold et al. 1989) and Helix lucorum statoconia \n\nFigure 37 EDS Spectrum indicating the most representative elements in Nassarius reticulatus statoliths. C: Carbon; \n\nCa: Calcium; Mg: Magnesium; Na: Sodium; O: Oxygen; S: Sulfur; and Sr: Strontium. \n\nFigure 38 WDS Spectra indicating the most representative elements present in Nassarius reticulatus statoliths. C: \n\nCarbon; Ca: Calcium; Na: Sodium; O: Oxygen \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n(Gorgiladze 2002); nor of K and Si as for H. lucorum statoconia (Gorgiladze 2002); neither \n\nP as it was described for statoliths of Strombus gigas larva (Salley 1986). \n\n Maximum and minimum concentrations for Ca, Mg, Na, O, S and Sr by statolith are \n\npresented in Table 4. We were unable to quantify C under this protocol since our surfaces \n\nwere metalized with atoms of this element to guarantee the material electrical \n\nconductivity. Generally, concentrations of Ca and O are of the same order of magnitude \n\n(1x105 ppm), as well as of the pair Na and Sr (1x103 ppm) and Mg and S (1x102 ppm).  \n\n \n\nTable 4 Elemental analysis of Nassarius reticulatus adult statoliths (S.1, S.2 and S.3) by EPMA.

However, we \n\ncannot compare absolute values since different analytical methods were applied and \n\nresults are on different biogenic structures (statoconia and statolith) and in different \n\nspecies. In Nassarius reticulatus statoliths, Ca and O are effectively the most \n\nrepresentative elements: Ca was found at higher concentrations, varying from 371500 to \n\n422300 ppm, while O ranged between 152700 and 171800 ppm (Table 3). Sodium \n\nconcentrations varied from 2541 and 6063; Sr from 1307 and 8873 ppm; S from 469 and \n\n1309 ppm; and Mg, which was not always detected, ranged from 198 to 863 ppm. \n\n Mean concentrations of these elements by increment (N, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are \n\nshown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 for S.1, S.2 and S.3, respectively. It should be noted that the \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nnarrowness of N in S.1 (Figure 36a and Table 5), of increment 5 in S.2 (Figure 36b and \n\nTable 6) and of increments 4 and 5 in S.3 (Figure 36c and Table 7) did not allow \n\nquantitative analyses at these areas. In EPMA, analyses are performed in points of ?1\u00b5m \n\n(the electron beam diameter) although an interaction volume of ?3\u00b5m must be \n\nconsidered. Hence, the interaction volume in the aforementioned cases would certainly \n\nimply the quantification of elements contained not only in the light band of the increment \n\n(as in all other cases) but also in the adjacent dark ring, thus misleading the results.  \n\n \n\nTable 5 Elemental analysis of statolith S.1 by EPMA.

The only exception was Na concentration in statolith S.1, \n\nwhich presents a significant difference between increments 1 and 5, being higher in the \n\nlast increment (compare Table 4 and Table 8). \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding the occurrence of periodical cycles, no particular pattern was evident. \n\nFigure 39 shows the line profiles for C, Ca, O and Sr in S.3 (the most representative \n\nelements in S.3), with the indication of the dark rings along the statolith radius, as an \n\nexample of what was done to understand if any elemental pattern could be described. \n\nLikewise, Mg and S profiles (not shown in Figure 39 but also analysed) did not reveal any \n\nspecific pattern along the statolith radius. \n\n \n\n These are intriguing results since the annual periodicity of growth rings in the \n\nstatoliths of Nassarius reticulatus was already proved (Chatzinikolaou and Richardson \n\n2007) and so it was expected that at least some of the major elements would show a \n\nperiodical pattern along the statolith radius. However, there are no well marked peaks \n\nand instead several peaks are spread along the profiles: not even at rings, regions claimed \n\nto be produced annually when animals stop growing at the cold season (Barroso et al. \n\n2005a; Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), any consistent \n\ndecrease is observed. In the example of S.3 (Figure 39), Ca decreases slightly at the MR \n\nand increases at R1, having any particular variation in R2 and R3 and decreasing in R4. \n\nOxygen decreases in R1 which coincides with the increase of Ca. Yet several other peaks \n\nare observed along the Ca profile, for example around 18 and 38\u00b5m from the profile \n\nstart, where no ring is observed in the COMP image (within increments 1 and 2, see \n\nFigure 36). \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39 Line profiles of C, Sr, Ca and O along S.3 radius.

On the bottom of the figure there is also part of Figure 35 (S.3 COMP image) indicating the \n\nexact position of S.3 dark rings (MR, R1, R2, R3 and R4). \n\n \n\n The presence of other minor / trace elements \u2013 Al, Ba, Cu, Hg and Sn \u2013 was also \n\nsought in increments 1, 2 and 3 of statolith S.3. Tin was not detected in any of the nine \n\npunctual analyses conducted (three per increment).

Campana (1997; 1999) showed that there are \n\nsignificant differences in determining otoliths elemental composition by using different \n\nanalytical procedures. The author suggested that the major elements (C, Ca and O) can be \n\ntruthfully determined by several methods but minor elements such as Na can only be \n\naccurately measured with an electron microprobe, while trace elements quantification \n\nrequire proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) or inductively coupled plasma mass \n\nspectrometry (ICP-MS). The author also pointed the reduced sensitivity of most beam-\n\nbased assays compared to their solution-based counterparts, in part due to the much \n\nlower sample weights being analysed. Not only did the sensitivity of the solution-based \n\ntechniques extend over a broader range of elements, but the precision of those assays \n\nwas significantly better than those of the beam-based methods (Campana 1997; \n\nCampana 1999). In fact, looking at our results, Mg was detected in the EDS spectrum as a \n\nminor element and we were not able to quantify it in some analyses (see Table 5 and 7) \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nwhereas increasing measurement times and beam current allowed the detection and \n\nquantification of Ba and Cu in concentrations higher than those obtained for Mg in S.3 \n\n(Table 7 and 9). \n\n Of course that such a comparison of precision is not strictly valid, since the probed \n\nprocedures incorporate the biogenic material heterogeneity which is not present in the \n\nsolution-based methods. Actually, EPMA allows punctual analysis, without material loss \n\nand in specific areas, but what is an advantage in some cases can be of no value in others. \n\nEPMA allowed us to determine concentrations by increment, from the nucleus to the \n\nstatolith edge, what is impossible by other analytical methods such as ICP-MS since the \n\nentire sample is consumed during analysis. Nonetheless, we cannot assume neither that \n\nthe elements we quantified are the only ones present within our samples nor conclude \n\nthat, because we could not detect for example Sn, this element is not present in \n\nstatoliths. \n\n Even so, these technique allow the characterization of Nassarius reticulatus adult \n\nstatoliths and accurately measured the most representative elements \u2013 Ca, O, Sr, Na and \n\nS \u2013 along the structure all radius. \n\n \n\n3.5. The gastropod statolith organic matrix \n\n \n\n There are also references for the presence of an organic matrix in gastropods \n\nstatoliths, although it was not possible to find a definite work on such issue as there is for \n\ncephalopods statoliths (Radtke 1983) and fish otoliths (see review by Campana 1999).  \n\n D'Asaro (1965) noted that, after S. gigas veligers fixation in Bouin's acidic solution, \n\nall that was left of the statolith was a \u2018layered organic matrix\u2019. Some years later, Salley \n\n(1986) referred that the use of acetic acid have dissolved the mineral component of \n\nstatoliths leaving behind a shrivelled organic (outer) matrix, but just in some of the S. \n\ngigas larvae analysed. The author has then pointed, as a possible explanation for \n\ninconsistency, that the organic matrix sheathing the statolith might form an impermeable \n\ncoat, while in some statoliths a deformation of this outer layer could render their \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\npermeability to the acid (Salley 1986). Apart from these records, though without checking \n\nchemical nor organic composition, Gorgiladze et al. (2010) stated that statoconia are \n\nmicroscopic biomineral structures formed by growth layers of mineral and organic origin. \n\nNevertheless, these authors referred a previous work showing, by phase contrast \n\nmicroscopy, that statoconia consisted of alternating dark and light concentric layers \n\naround an optically dense oval core (or nucleus), often with radial streaks seen more or \n\nless clearly (Gorgiladze 2002). Actually, this internal microstructure of prominent and \n\nclearly defined concentric growth rings have been demonstrated in suitably prepared \n\ngastropod statoliths of Concholepas concholepas (Zacherl et al. 2003a), Littorina scabra \n\n(Bell 1984), Nassarius reticulatus (Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson \n\n2007), Neptunea antiqua (Richardson et al. 2005a), Polinices pulchellus (Richardson et al. \n\n2005b), Strombus costatus (Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997) and Strombus gigas \n\n(Salley 1986; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997). Hence, the gastropod statolith have \n\nbeen proposed for age and growth studies (Bell 1984; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn \n\n1997; Barroso et al. 2005b; Richardson et al. 2005a; Richardson et al. 2005b; \n\nChatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), being also pointed as having particular potential for \n\nmany others applications, namely understanding aspects of the life history and ecology of \n\ngastropods, issues previously provided only by fish and cephalopods.  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n3.6 References \n\nBarroso, C.

Geochim Cosmochim Acta 67: 4091-4099. \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Conclusion \n\nThe statoltith, on gastropods, in the four subclasses studied on the present work \n\n(chapter 2), is only present on subclass Caenogastropoda. The fact that species of \n\nsubclass Caenogastropoda have one statolith instead of statoconia makes them more \n\ninteresting for the study of sclerochronology In all caenogastropods species the statolith \n\ncan be characterized as round, translucent, with concentric rings.  \n\nThe statocyst are close to pedal ganglia, in caenogastropods are dorsal to pedal ganglia \n\nand in the others subclasses, Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda and Heterobranchia, are \n\nbetween pleural and pedal ganglia. The statocyst structure, of N. reticulatus \n\n(Caenogastropoda), is a transparent vesicle with a round shape like the found on \n\nheterobranchs. The main difference between the statocyst that have statoliths and the \n\nstatocyst that have statoconia is the number and size of the receptor cells (Stahlschmidt \n\nand Wolff 1972; Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Gao and Wiederhold \n\n1997).  \n\nIt was verified that, in the specie Nucella lapillus, the statolith follows the growth \n\nof the animal from the embryo to adulthood. A statolith with 3 rings was observed in an \n\nembryo with 24th days. It was concluded that the statolith, in this specie, is formed before \n\nthe 3rd week, probably in the beginning of the second week, as reported on Lloyd et al. \n\n(2008) for the specie Kelletia kelleti. The statolith growth is parallels to the species \n\ngrowth. This was already reported for N. recticulatus collected from Aveiro by Barroso et \n\nal. (2005b).  \n\nThe particularity, of the statolith increment follows the growth of the animal \n\nthroughout life, lead us to want to know the statoltih composition, because the statolith \n\nmay probably provide an important register of physical and chemical characteristics of \n\nthe marine environment.  \n\nThe general composition of statoliths radius from adults N. reticulatus was \n\ncharacterized: Ca, O, Sr, Na and S. No significant differences in the different elements \n\nconcentration between the increments were found. About the occurrence of periodical \n\ncycles in the statolith rings, there were no evidences of a particular pattern.  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nThe rings in the statoltith are related with the age of the species. In spite of the \n\nresults with the electron microprobe do not demonstrate the presence of seasonality in \n\nthe rings, Barroso et al. (2005b) has proven that the statoltihs rings are annual rings. In \n\nfact, Barroso et al. (2005b) was the first work that demonstrated that adult gastropods \n\nstatoliths of N. reticulatus had potential for sclerochronology.  \n\nThe study of adult gastropod statoliths is just beginning and there are many \n\nhypothesis to be tested, namely if statoliths can be accurately used as pluriannual \n\nchronometers; if they are good indicators of environmental pollution; and if, for example, \n\nthese two properties can be combined to use gastropods statoliths as archives to \n\nreconstruct marine pollution histories. Some of these hypotheses have been successfully \n\ntested in analogous structures such as fish otoliths (Campana 1999) and cephalopods \n\nstatoliths (Zumholz 2005) and also in some gastropods through monitoring annual rings \n\nproduction monthly in wild animals (Barroso et al. 2005a).  \n\n The hypothesis of using gastropods statoliths as biomarkers of marine pollution \n\nhas huge interest for environmental pollution monitoring namely in coastal waters. In \n\ncomparison with the open coast, near shore waters along coastal margins and estuaries \n\nare often rich in pollutants of anthropogenic origin (Bruland 1983) resulting in elevated \n\nconcentrations of many elements in hard parts (as it has been shown for otoliths, \n\nconsidered as metabolically inert timekeepers and environmental recorders; Campana \n\n1999). Otoliths annular structure examination offers the possibility of evaluate \n\ncontaminants incorporation over time, providing a historic record of past and recent \n\nexposure of fish to contaminants (Campana 1999). However, fishes are highly mobile and \n\nthis approach has been applied mainly to track migratory and dispersion routes (Milton \n\nand Chenery 2001; Swearer et al. 2003). Contrariwise, as referred above, gastropods are \n\nsedentary or poorly mobile organisms, a pre-requisite for selecting them as good \n\npollution indicators. Furthermore, the gastropod statolith is less complex than the \n\ncephalopods counterpart and their microstructure is already proved to allow age \n\ndetermination and to evaluate growth (Bell 1984; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997; \n\nBarroso et al. 2005b; Richardson et al. 2005a; Richardson et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and \n\nRichardson 2007). Nevertheless, and despite the recognition of their great potential to \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nreconstruct marine pollution histories, there is still a long way to go until their validation \n\nas true biorecorders of environmental changes. \n\n  \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n4.1 References  \n\nBarroso, C.
