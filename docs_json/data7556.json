In particular for Brazil, the importance of\n\ngeophysical simulations is even greater due to applications in the oil industry.\n\nHowever, due to the extremely large Reynolds numbers associated with\n\ngeophysical flows, the current available computational resources (and certainly in the\n\nnear future) are not enough to simulate it entirely. Regularized models are simplified\n\nmodels designed to deal with this kind of problem, because they reduce the degrees\n\nof freedom in simulations by virtue of small changing the original equations, which\n\nshorten the energy cascade and enable to the the use of less refined meshes.\n\nIn this work, two models with extensive application in geophysical flow\n\nare studied: the Barotropic Vorticity model (BV model) and the Boussinesq model.\n\nFirst, in the case of the BV model, three different regularization techniques are\n\nstudied, namely, the alpha regularization with modified Tikhonov-Lavrentiev decon-\n\nvolution, the Bardina regularization and the alpha regularization with van Cittert\n\napproximate deconvolution. Crank-Nicolson in time, finite element in space algo-\n\nrithms for these models are proposed and rigorously proven to be unconditionally\n\nstable and optimally convergent. Also, computational simulations are performed\n\nthat validate the developed theory for the proposed regularized models, and shows\n\ntheir effectiveness on coarse meshes in situations similar to real applications.\n\nIn the Boussinesq model case, four regularizations are studied, namely,\n\nalpha, omega, Leray and modified Leray, all of them with van Cittert approximate\n\ndeconvolution and some techniques which have enjoyed success when applied to the\n\nNavier-Stokes equations. Crank-Nicolson/finite element algorithms, are developed\n\nxix\n\n\n\nand numerically analysed. They are proven to be unconditionally stable and opti-\n\nmally convergent. Moreover, computational simulations are performed to validate\n\nthe convergence theory and to evaluate the performance of each regularization in\n\nmore realistic situations. In these simulations, the Leray regularization, in addition\n\nof presenting substantial computational advantages because it enables controlling\n\nthe model consistency error order with no significant increase in computations, pro-\n\nduced the best solutions in coarse meshes when compared to the expected solutions.\n\nxx\n\n\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Problem statement\n\nGeophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) is the study of flows influenced by\n\nEarth\u2019s rotation. It is the foundation for understanding atmospheric and oceanic\n\nflows. Its difference from traditional engineering flows is due to the presence of ficti-\n\ntious forces caused by the description of the flow in a non-inertial rotating reference\n\nsystem: the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nPresently, GFD is related to at least two important scientific subjects:\n\nweather forecasting and climate modeling. It is also important to other scientific\n\nfields such as meso and large scale studies in oceanography and meteorology, plank-\n\ntonic migration in marine biology, waves, tides and sedimentology studies and pol-\n\nlutant dispersion in atmosphere and ocean. Moreover, it has important commercial\n\nand social applications such as navigation, agriculture, coastal engineering, natural\n\ndisasters prediction and mitigation and, especially in the Brazil case, oil exploration.\n\nAs in engineering flows, modeling geophysical flows is a challenging task,\n\nthe reason being that geophysical flows are described by the Navier-Stokes equations\n\n(NSE). NSE are well known by mathematicians because of their complexity. Even\n\nafter centuries of effort, fundamental theoretical aspects such as existence of strong\n\nsolutions in the three-dimensional case remains unsolved. In the year 2000, the\n\nClay Mathematics Institute offered a one million dollar prize to anyone who makes\n\nsubstantial progress presenting a proof or a counterexample. To the best of our\n\nknowledge, until this moment the problem remains unsolved!\n\nAs in other fields of fluid dynamics, analytical solutions for geophysical\n\nflows may be achieved only in a very limited number of cases, so instead one needs to\n\nemploy advanced numerical methods and computational simulations. Geophysical\n\n1\n\n\n\nflows simulations was one of the first applications of general-purposes computers\n\nto numerical simulations. In 1950, Jule Charney, Ragnar Fjo?rtoft and John von\n\nNeumann in their seminal work entitled \u201cNumerical integration of the barotropic\n\nvorticity equation\u201d [17] accomplished the first computational weather forecast using\n\nthe legendary ENIAC world\u2019s first computer (see [72, 71] and references therein for\n\na historical survey). Since that time, several mathematical models and numerical\n\nmethods have been devised in order to, along with the computer advances, simulate\n\noceans and atmosphere. Among the available methods, the Finite Element Method\n\n(FEM) is one of the most powerful method ever conceived in order to approximate\n\nsolutions of boundary-value problems, such as NSE. It has gained importance due\n\nto its relative ease to deal with non-structured meshes and arbitrary geometries, as\n\nthose often necessary in geophysical applications.\n\nAssociated with the difficulty of solving NSE it is the phenomenon of\n\nturbulence. In particular, the correct representation of geophysical flows, due to\n\nhigh Reynolds number, depends on the development of advanced techniques to deal\n\nwith turbulence. High Reynolds number flows have a wideband spectrum. A simple\n\nestimation based on the Kolmogorov theory [92] shows that a typical geophysical\n\nflow with horizontal length scale of 100 km and a Reynolds number of 1010 will\n\ndissipate energy in a length scale of centimeters. Therefore, simulations resolving\n\nall the necessary scales involved in geophysical flows (Direct Numerical Simulation\n\n- DNS) are far beyond the reach of current computers.\n\nAmong the different techniques to deal with this problem, Large Eddy\n\nSimulation (LES) and Regularization Models are two of the most promising meth-\n\nods. LES consists of calculating the large structures of a flow by modeling the\n\neffect of small scale structures on the large structures. This is accomplished by\n\nfiltering the Navier-Stokes equations and resolving the filtered equations, whereas\n\nthe resulting subfilter stress, which represents the interaction between the resolved\n\nand unresolved scales, is modeled. This approach is valid because, according to the\n\n2\n\n\n\nKolmogorov theory, the large structures, which are related with external forces and\n\nboundary conditions, are specific for each flow, whereas the small structures have a\n\nuniversal behavior [92, 5]. On the other hand, regularization models were initially\n\ncreated for theoretical purposes. For example, the Leray-? model is a well-posed\n\nearlier regularization proposed by Jean Leray in 1934 in order to analyse the Navier-\n\nStokes equations [64]. A common feature for regularization models is that they are\n\nwell-posed and regular from the mathematical point of view. The regularization\n\nmeaning the disappearance of supposed existing singularities in the original Navier-\n\nStokes equations [97]. Recently, a considerable interest has arisen for regularization\n\nmodels as simpler models to deal with turbulence in numerical simulations. In this\n\napproach, the regularization model is obtained from the direct regularization of the\n\nconvective flux [34]. Thus, the computed solution is a regularized approximation of\n\nthe NSE solution, rather than a local, spacial average of the fluid velocity (as in LES\n\nmodels [66]). However, some studies have shown that regularization models can be\n\ninterpreted as LES models using the so-called regularization principle [32, 33, 34].\n\nThe main advantage of these approaches in relation to DNS modeling is that the\n\nnumber of degrees of freedom in numerical simulations are significant fewer in LES\n\nand regularization models. More recently, some LES models such as the Approxi-\n\nmate Deconvolution Models [100] and regularization models such as alpha models\n\nstarted to be tested in the geophysical framework [47, 112, 22, 41, 42].\n\nDespite computational simulations being widely applied in geophysi-\n\ncal flows, studies involving new numerical schemes and their mathematical analysis\n\nare uncommon, possibly due to the wide range of numerical schemes available and\n\nthe difficulty to perform a mathematical analysis in realistic conditions. Neverthe-\n\nless, this kind of study, even in non-realistic situations, are useful to produce more\n\naccurate results with less computational cost.\n\nIn light of the above, this thesis focuses on application and mathemat-\n\nical analysis of regularization modeling techniques to geophysical flows. Thus, new\n\n3\n\n\n\nalgorithms using FEM discretizations were developed, analysed, and computational\n\ntests were performed in a geophysical context in order to understand and evaluate\n\ntheir performance in simulations.\n\n1.2 Relevance\n\nThe subject of this thesis is closely related with some current issues,\n\nsuch as oil exploration in the pre-salt layer, climate change, and weather and ocean\n\nforecasting. Apart from being motivated by interesting fluid dynamics and numer-\n\nical analysis open problems like those described in the previous section, it is also\n\nencouraged by its substantial applications of social interest.\n\nFrom the point of view of fluid dynamics and numerical analysis, this\n\nthesis deals with subjects such as the development of stable and robust algorithms in\n\norder to apply regularization models in geophysical fluid dynamics. There is strong\n\nevidence, such as that presented in the next section, to believe it would be fruitful\n\nin this application, and provide more accurate results with less computational cost.\n\nOn the other hand, from the point of view of applications, the following\n\nthree issues guided the development of this thesis:\n\n1. Brazil has become an important oil producer. With the recent discovery of the\n\nvast oil reserve in the pre-salt layer, Brazil can become one of the largest oil\n\nproducers in the world. However, oil exploration in the pre-salt layer is very\n\nchallenging. An important tool to assist oil exploration in the sea is the use of\n\nreliable ocean models. They are necessary both for logistics in oil exploration and\n\nto mitigate the environmental impact caused by oil spills. Moreover, ocean and\n\natmosphere forecasting also helps in navigation. For logistics, ocean simulations\n\ncan supply the velocity field, which is essential to design oil platforms. From\n\nthe environmental point of view, ocean forecasting is very helpful in cases of oil\n\n4\n\n\n\nspills because it provides information about the fate of the oil slick. It is very\n\nimportant, especially in the case of Brazil, where there exists natural sanctuaries\n\nsuch as the Abrolhos bank, for instance.\n\n2. Climate modeling allows a better understanting in man\u2019s role in climate change.\n\nWith a huge heat capacity, oceans are particularly important because they absorb\n\nand store heat, damping temperature fluctuations. However, oceanic simulations\n\ncan only be performed on coarse meshes in order to be computationally viable.\n\nMoreover, most of them employ URANS (unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-\n\nStokes) and the eddy viscosity hypothesis. Thus, they are likely to provided\n\nlimited results, affecting large scale features [41, 54]. Therefore, it is necessary\n\nto develop more appropriate techniques to deal with subgrid scale motion.\n\n3. In addition, regularization models can have a positive impact on atmospheric\n\nand oceanic forecasts. Geophysical flow forecasts depend heavily on the initial\n\nconditions, resulting in a very small prediction time [57]. Thus, Control Theory\n\nhas to be applied to guarantee accurate predictions. Most of these techniques\n\nassumes a perfect model, that is, a model without bias whose only source of error\n\nis the uncertainty in initial conditions. Therefore, the more accurate the model\n\nis, the more suitable the Control Theory will be for this kind of problem.\n\nComputational fluid dynamics has also been used increasingly in envi-\n\nronmental applications and social welfare. At present, in order to build new indus-\n\ntries, harbours and oil platforms, governments, in several contries including Brazil\n\nrequire environmental impact studies involving ocean and/or atmospheric model-\n\ning. In addition, computational simulations are extensively used to help assess and\n\ncontrol damage in environmental accidents, such as the 2010 British Petroleum oil\n\nspill in the Gulf of Mexico, the 2011 Puyehue volcano plume in Chile and the 2011\n\ntsunami in Japan. All these applications may be immensely benefit by more accurate\n\ntechniques to simulate the ocean and atmosphere.\n\n5\n\n\n\n1.3 Theoretical background and objectives\n\nGeophysical flows present some differences compared to traditional en-\n\ngineering flows. The main differences are: the motion is thin (small aspect ratio)\n\nand is influenced by Earth\u2019s rotation.\n\nThe small aspect ratio results from the problem asymmetry due to dif-\n\nferences between vertical and horizontal scales in the Earth\u2019s surface. Large scale\n\ngeophysical flows have an aspect ratio similar to a sheet of paper. Typical hori-\n\nzontal scale is 106 meters and depth scale is 103 meters. As a result, the vertical\n\nvelocity component is much smaller than horizontal velocity. Thus, some approxi-\n\nmations following from the small aspect ratio are often assumed in order to derive\n\nmathematical models for geophysical flows.\n\nIn addition, Newton\u2019s second law is formulated for inertial frames. How-\n\never, Earth\u2019s surface is not an inertial frame because of Earth\u2019s rotation. Thus\n\napparent forces must be considered in order to mathematically represent the flow\n\nin coordinate systems in the Earth\u2019s surface: the Coriolis and centrifugal forces. A\n\nscale analysis shows that the centrifugal force and vertical component of Coriolis\n\nforce are negligible in comparison to other terms, but the horizontal component of\n\nthe Coriolis force can be comparable to the other terms in the horizontal momentum\n\nequations depending on the length scale of the flow [91]. The relative importance\n\nof Earth\u2019s rotation effect is estimated by the nondimensional Rossby number (Ro)\n\ndefined as:\n\nRo =\nU\n\n2?E sin(?)L\n\nwhere U and L are respectively characteristic horizontal velocity and length scales,\n\n?E is the planetary angular velocity and ? is the latitude of the flow.\n\nThe Rossby number describes the ratio of inertial and Coriolis acceler-\n\nations. When Ro&lt;&lt;1 the flow is said to be geophysical.\n\n6\n\n\n\nGeophysical flows can be studied by mathematical models resulting\n\nfrom different levels of aproximations, which, despite their simplifications, can still\n\nrepresent several important physical phenomena. The main geophysical models are:\n\n? Primitive Equations\n\n? Boussinesq\n\n? Shallow Water\n\n? Quasi-geostrophic\n\nThe most complete mathematical model used to simulate geophysical\n\nflows is the Primitive Equations Model, which describes flows with small aspect\n\nratio subject to the Coriolis, gravitational and external forces and with pressure\n\nfield determined by density and free surface fields. It is often used in atmospheric\n\nand oceanic forecast systems, and in climate modeling. The system of equations:\n\n?uH\n?t\n\n+ uH \u00b7?HuH + w\n?uH\n?z\n\n+ 2?E \u00d7uH +\n1\n\n?0\n?Hp??H?HuH ??V\n\n?2uH\n?z2\n\n= f,\n\n?p\n\n?z\n+ ?g = 0,\n\n?H \u00b7uH +\n?w\n\n?z\n= 0,\n\n? = F(p,?i),\n\n??i\n?t\n\n+ uH \u00b7?H?i + w\n??i\n?z\n\n+ ?H,?i?H?i + ?V,?i\n?\n\n?z\n?i = 0,\n\ndescribes the primitive equations model [41, 14], where uH is the horizontal velocity\n\nvector (u,v), w is the vertical velocity component, ?H = ( ??x,\n?\n?y\n\n) is the horizontal\n\ngradient operator, ?E is the angular planetary velocity, ?0 is the fluid reference\n\ndensity (constant), ? is the density, p is the pressure, ?H is the horizontal kinematic\n\nviscosity, ?V is the vertical kinematic viscosity, f is the resultant external force, F is\n\na functional for the thermodynamic state equation, ?i are the thermodynamic state\n\nscalars (temperature, humidity or salinity), ?H,?i is the horizontal diffusivity of the\n\nscalar ?i and ?V,?i is the vertical diffusivity of the scalar ?i.\n\n7\n\n\n\nAnother important model is the Boussinesq Model. The Boussinesq\n\nModel allows us to represent flows in the presence of density stratification in which\n\nthe Buoyancy force is important. The Boussinesq model is given by\n\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?u + 2? \u00d7 u +\n\n1\n\n?0\n?p???u + ??gk = f,\n\n?\u00b7 u = 0,\n???\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7??? ??????? = 0,\n\nwhere u is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, ?0 is the reference density (constant),\n\n?? is an active tracer (temperature or salinity, for example), g is the gravitational\n\nacceleration, ? is the kinematic viscosity, f is the external force and ??? is the ?\n?\n\ndiffusivity. Note that momentum and tracer equations are constrained by the buoy-\n\nancy term in the Boussinesq Model, therefore flow is forced by spatial differences in\n\nthe density field.\n\nIn addition to Primitive equations and Boussinesq Model, the two-\n\ndimensional Shallow Water Model describes a flow with a small aspect ratio\n\nand under the action of pressure gradients caused by gradients in the fluid free\n\nsurface field. In the geophysical case this kind of flow is described by [91]:\n\n?uH\n?t\n\n+ uH \u00b7?uH ?fk \u00d7 uH ???uH + g?h = f,\n\n?h\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 (huH) = 0,\n\nwhere f = 2? sin(?) is the Coriolis parameter and h is the water depth.\n\nFinally, one of the simplest models is the Quasi-geostrophic Model.\n\nThe geostrophic equilibrium is the fundamental state (or mean state) of a geophysical\n\nflow, in which the pressure gradients and Coriolis force are in balance, i.e.,\n\nfk \u00d7 uh = ?\n1\n\n?\n?p.\n\n8\n\n\n\nThe Quasi-geostrophic model results from an assymptotic expansion of\n\nthe velocity field in the Rossby number Ro, that is,\n\nu (x,y,t,Ro) = u0 (x,y,t) + u1 (x,y,t) Ro + u2 (x,y,t) Ro\n2 + ....\n\nUsing this expansion, a closed set of equations is obtained from the\n\nshallow water model representing the balance of the first order terms around the\n\nzeroth order geostrophic balance (mean state). The balance of the first order terms\n\nis the quasi-geostropic model [91, 47, 100], also known as Barotropic Vorticity model,\n\ngiven by\n\nRo\n??\n\n?t\n+ RoJ(?,?) ?\n\n??\n\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F,\n\n?? = ??.\n\nwhich ? is the vorticity, ? is the streamfunction, J(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Jacobian, Ro is the\n\nRossby number, ?M is the Munk scale, L is the length scale and F is the forcing.\n\nThe four models above mentioned can describe a vast variety of geo-\n\nphysical phenomena such as the general ocean and atmosphere circulation, meso-\n\nscale processes (vortices and cyclones) and also planetary (Rossby), plane, Kelvin\n\nand Poincare? waves [91].\n\nDue to the high Reynolds number associated with geophysical flows\n\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) are unfeasible. Therefore, computational simu-\n\nlations are carried out in meshes which cannot resolve all necessary scales anticipated\n\nby the Kolmogorov Theory of energy cascade, and some methods are necessary to\n\ndeal with the small scales which are not resolvable. Traditionally, small scale mod-\n\neling in geophysical flow simulations is made using the Reynolds Stress tensor and\n\nthe Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis, which is a fundamentally dissipative tech-\n\nnique [47, 100]. This approach has been used because it provides the correct rate of\n\nenergy dissipation [100] and improves numerical stability [47, 54]. However, accord-\n\ning to [47], increased values of viscosity reduce the flow variability in large scales\n\n9\n\n\n\ncausing meaningful differences between coarse resolution meshes and DNS. The ef-\n\nfects of high eddy viscosity values on climate simulations are studied in [54], and\n\nthey observed several places in the ocean where computed solutions were severely\n\naffected by this problem. They also noted that reducing eddy viscosity leads to a\n\ngenerally improved ocean circulation at the expense of increased numerical noise.\n\nThus, decreasing eddy viscosity values is not enough to solve this problem, and the\n\nsolution is probably related to a better representation of small scale flow.\n\nBesides, the small aspect ratio in geophysical flows results in a quasi-\n\ntwo-dimensional flow and, hence, a possible coexistence between the enstrophy cas-\n\ncade and the inverse energy cascade [103, 102, 28]. Thus, an approach consistent\n\nwith phenomenology is imperative.\n\nLES and regularization models are projected to deal with this kind of\n\nproblem. Geophysical flows inspired the first LES model through the seminal work of\n\nJoseph Smagorinsky [104], but the subsequent development has been made based on\n\nengineering applications [100, 28]. Recently, a new interest in LES and regularization\n\nmodels has emerged for geophysical applications with alpha [47, 112, 41, 42] and\n\nADM [6, 100] models.\n\nThe Navier-Stokes-? (NS-?) model has received much attention due\n\nto its attractive physical and mathematical properties. For example, NS-? admits\n\nregular unique solutions [24, 77], is frame invariant [38], conserves energy, helicity\n\nand 2D enstrophy [25, 93] and cascades energy at the same rate as Navier-Stokes\n\nequations in wavelengths up to ?, after which it accelerates energy dissipation [25].\n\nFurthermore, it allows a significant reduction of degrees of freedom in computer\n\nsimulations. Despite of being presented as a regularization model, NS-? can also be\n\ninterpreted as a kind of LES model [20, 31, 38].\n\nBased on NS-? model, alpha models has been developed for geophysical\n\nflows; for example, the Quasi-geostrophic-? model [47, 100], the shallow water-?\n\n10\n\n\n\nmodel [112], the Boussinesq-? [22] and the Primitive equations-? model [41, 42].\n\nThey also present computer simulations which are promising.\n\nIn addition to the NS-? model, other alpha-type models has been re-\n\ncently developed for NS equations, such as the NS-? [61, 65], Leray-? [32, 33],\n\nModified Leray-? [51], Bardina [3, 15] and NS-Voigt [15, 56, 68] models and their\n\ndeconvolution generalizations [93, 64, 76, 75, 9] which improves accuracy and com-\n\nputational cost. Some of these can also be interpreted as a kind of LES model\n\n[32, 33, 34].\n\nIn light of the above, there is significant evidence to believe that reg-\n\nularization models can perform better than traditional eddy viscosity models in\n\ngeophysical flow simulations with a viable computational cost. In the case of engi-\n\nneering flows, FEM algorithms were proposed and analysed to alpha [65, 76], omega\n\n[65, 75], Leray-? [64, 9] and zeroth order ADM [74]. Traditionally, algorithms are\n\nproposed and analysed for stability, which is related, in the appropriate norm, to the\n\nphysical intuiton of energy conservation. It is also common to include error anal-\n\nysis showing convergence in appropriate norms. Then, computational simulations\n\nare made to determine whether the model can reproduce a known pattern observed\n\nin some benchmark test. However, algorithms, mathematical analysis and compu-\n\ntational tests are still necessary for geophysical analogues of these regularization\n\nmodels.\n\nIn GFD, flows are routinely studied separately as barotropic and baro-\n\nclinic flows1 (see, e.g. [91]), the reason being the difference in terms of temporal\n\nand spatial scales between these two kind of flows. In this thesis we addressed GFD\n\nconsidering these two points of view:\n\n1. Can state-of-art regularization models improve coarse mesh large-scale geophys-\n\nical barotropic simulations? The first part of the thesis investigates this ques-\n\ntion, performing a numerical analysis of the Quasi-Geostrophic model for three\n\n11\n\n\n\ndifferent regularization techniques, namely, alpha with Tikhonov approximate\n\ndeconvolution, Bardina and alpha with Van Cittert approximated deconvolution.\n\n2. How can state-of-art regularization models affect numerical solutions obtained\n\nin the case of computational expensive baroclinic density current simulations?\n\nThis question is addressed in the last chapter, in which we studied the Boussi-\n\nnesq model through four generalized deconvolved regularizations, namely, alpha,\n\nLeray-?, omega and Modified-Leray-?.\n\nThus, the main objective of this thesis is to propose robust algorithms\n\nto apply regularization models in geophysical flows. In addition, we intend to attain\n\nthe following specific goals:\n\n1. Provide algorithms through FEM discretizations to apply regularization\n\ntechniques in models used in geophysical fluid dynamics.\n\n2. Study these algorithms from the point of view of numerical analysis.\n\n3. Implement them and carry out simulations in order to evaluate their\n\nperformance.\n\nAll these aspects, with mathematical and scientific motivations, are the object of\n\ncareful analysis and understanding in this thesis.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we study a Crank-Nicolson Finite Element scheme to\n\nan alpha regularization with deconvolution of the Barotropic Vorticity (BV) model\n\nof geophysical flows, called the BV-Tikhonov model. The BV-Tikhonov model is\n\na deconvolved version of the BV-? model where the Tikhonov regularization is\n\nmodified to give an approximate deconvolution of the Helmholtz filter. We prove\n\nthe scheme is unconditionally stable and second order accurate. We also test the\n\n1Barotropic flows are those which the density is only a function of pressure. Otherwise, the\nflow is called baroclinic [110].\n\n12\n\n\n\nBV-Tikhonov model in the traditional double-gyre wind forcing benchmark. We\n\nshow, when the coarse mesh BV model solution degenerates, the BV-? model can\n\nretrieve the high resolution pattern, but solutions are dramatically improved by\n\nthe choice of the deconvolution parameter in the BV-Tikhonov model. We believe\n\nthis behaviour is related to the second order consistency error term shown in the\n\nconvergence analysis, which could affect the model solution in coarse meshes, but\n\ncould be handled by a careful choice of the deconvolution parameter.\n\nIn Chapter 32 we study a Crank-Nicolson in time and Finite Element\n\nin space numerical scheme for a Bardina regularization of the barotropic vortic-\n\nity model. We derive the regularized model from the simplified Bardina model in\n\nprimitive variables, present a numerical algorithm for it, and prove the algorithm\n\nis unconditionally stable with respect to the timestep size, and optimally conver-\n\ngent in both space and time. Numerical experiments are provided that verify the\n\ntheoretical convergence rates, and also that test the model/scheme on a benchmark\n\ndouble-gyre wind forcing experiment. For the latter test, we find the proposed\n\nmodel/scheme gives a good coarse mesh approximation to the highly resolved direct\n\nnumerical simulation of the barotropic vorticity model, and compares favorably to\n\nrelated regularization model results.\n\nIn Chapter 43 we study the BV-?-Deconvolution model. It is a fam-\n\nily of regularizations of the Barotropic Vorticity model that generalizes the BV-?\n\nmodel and improves its accuracy. An unconditionally stable and optimally con-\n\nvergent scheme for the BV-?-Deconvolution model is proposed and we show that\n\nit is O(?2N+2), where N is the deconvolution order, whereas the BV-? model is\n\nat most second order accurate. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the\n\npredicted convergence rates and test the model in the traditional double gyre wind\n\nexperiment. For the latter test, we show that the BV-?-Deconvolution model can\n\nretrieve the expected high resolution pattern, being more accurate for larger values\n\nof deconvolution order.\n\n13\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 5 we study numerically four regularization models with de-\n\nconvolution for density currents, namely, Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-\n\nLeray and Modified-Boussinesq-Leray. A Crank-Nicolson in time and Finite Ele-\n\nment in space algorithm is proposed and proved to be unconditionally stable and\n\noptimally convergent, which is verified through convergence rates in computational\n\nsimulations. Finally, the regularization models are compared through the Marsigli\u2019s\n\nflow benchmark for Re = 2000 and Re = 5000. We found that Boussinesq-? and\n\nBoussinesq-Leray models produced the most accurate solutions for low Reynolds\n\nnumber. Moreover, as expected, all regularized models had their solutions improved\n\nwhen deconvolution order was increased. On the other hand, the Boussinesq-Leray\n\nprovided the best solution for high Reynolds number. Besides, from the computa-\n\ntional point of view the Boussinesq-Leray model presents great advantages due to\n\nits decoupling between momentum and filter equations which permits to increase\n\nthe deconvolution order with no significant increase in the computational cost.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 6 we present the main conclusions and suggestions\n\nfor future works.\n\n2The content of this chapter is coauthored by Professor Carolina C.

The Barotropic\n\nVorticity Model (BV model) is one of the simplest models used to represent geo-\n\nphysical flows. It is defined in dimensionless form by [47, 100]\n\nRo??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? =F,\n\n?? = ??,\n\nwhere ? is the vorticity, ? is the streamfunction, J(?,?) = ??\n?x\n\n??\n?y\n? ??\n\n?y\n??\n?x\n\nis the\n\nJacobian, Ro is the Rossby number, ?M is the Munk scale, L is the length scale and\n\nF is the forcing term. The BV model can be used to represent the meso and large\n\nscale flow in the atmosphere and oceans. It is commonly used in oceanography to\n\nstudy the midlatitude oceanic circulation. Furthermore, it can also be extended to\n\nmultilayer to describe the vertical motions in the ocean [78, 99]. Presently, it has\n\nbeen used in studies involving data assimilation [113, 21], climate [95, 73, 36] and\n\noceanic processes [12, 108].\n\nDespite the fact that the BV model is a simplified model in comparison\n\nwith the full primitive equations of geophysical flows, solving it numerically is still\n\nchallenging when long-time integration is necessary, as in climate modeling [100].\n\nTraditionally, essentially dissipative methods such as eddy viscosity parametrization\n\nhave been used to represent the under-resolved part of the flow. However, accord-\n\ning to [47] artificial viscosity tends to reduce variability and nonlinear structures\n\n15\n\n\n\nare often destroyed by excessive dissipation [37, 47]. Thus some methods such as\n\nApproximate Deconvolution Models [100, 99], BV-? [82, 81, 47] and BV-Bardina\n\n[59] have been developed with success to improve accuracy and reduce the degrees\n\nof freedom in computational simulations.\n\nThe BV-? model [47] is a regularization of the BV model in which the\n\nalpha terms modify the fluid nonlinearity without introducing additional dissipative\n\nterms or increasing the viscosity coefficient in the BV equations. In the BV-? model\n\nthe nonlinearity is altered so that the flow at length scales that are smaller than\n\nthe alpha length scale are nonlinearly removed by motions at the larger scales. The\n\nBarotropic Vorticity-? model (BV-?) is given by\n\nRo??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? =F, (2.2a)\n\n?? = ??, (2.2b)\n\n??2?? + ? =?, (2.2c)\n\nwhere ? is the filtered vorticity and ? is the filter length scale. A more complete\n\ndescription of BV-? is presented in [47].\n\nHowever, from the equation (2.2c) we can see that the BV-?, as well as\n\nits analogue counterpart for the Navier-Stokes equations, has an O(?2) consistency\n\nerror. Experiments have shown in the Navier-Stokes equations case (see [105] and\n\nreferences therein) that alpha models can have large error growth and that this error\n\ngrowth can be attenuated when accuracy is increased by replacing the filtered field\n\nby some higher order aproximation of the original field. Deconvolution regulariza-\n\ntion is a kind of regularization in which the filtered velocity u (or vorticity in the\n\nBV model case) is substituted in the regularized model by Du where D is a proper\n\ndeconvolution operator. The Tikhonov-Lavrentiev regularization is a general ap-\n\nproach to deal with ill-posed problems which allows to select desirable solutions in\n\nthe least square method. It can also be employed to produce a suitable approximate\n\nsolution to the deconvolution problem. In [105] the filtered velocity u is replaced\n\n16\n\n\n\nby D\u00b5u where the deconvolution operator D\u00b5 = [F + \u00b5(I ? F)]?1 is the modified\n\nTikhonov-Lavrentiev regularization of the formal filter inverse F?1 and 0 &lt;\u00b5 ? 1\n\nis a regularization parameter. Following the study presented in [105] on the appli-\n\ncation of the Tikhonov-Lavrentiev deconvolution in the Navier-Stokes context, in\n\nthis chapter we study a family of Tikhonov-Lavrentiev regularizations of the BV\n\nmodel, hereafter called BV-Tikhonov model, that results by replacing ? by D\u00b5? in\n\n(2.2b). We note that in this framework the original BV-? model results from the\n\nBV-Tikhonov family in the case in which \u00b5 = 1.\n\nIn order to apply the Tikhonov-Lavrentiev deconvolution in the BV-\n\n? model, we propose and study a Crank-Nicolson in time, finite element (FE) in\n\nspace algorithm to approximate solution for the BV-Tikhonov model. We believe\n\nthe advantage of BV-Tikhonov model over other techniques to deal with turbu-\n\nlence is in its simplicity, as there is only one filtering procedure that needs to be\n\nperformed and in its direct control over the regularization intensity through the \u00b5\n\nparameter. Moreover, although a significant amount of work has been done on the\n\nrelated vorticity-streamfunction formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (see [4]\n\nand references therein) and for steady state analysis of numerical schemes for BV\n\nmodel [26, 27], a numerical analysis for the BV-? model has not been performed.\n\nThus, the main objective of this chapter is to provide a FE algorithm for the BV-\n\nTikhonov model and study it from the numerical analysis point of the view. To the\n\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time that the FE method is applied to obtain\n\napproximated solutions for the BV-Tikhonov model.\n\nThe chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some notation\n\nand mathematical prelimimaries. The BV-Tikhonov algorithm and its stability are\n\npresented in Section 3. Convergence analysis is presented in Section 4. In Section 5\n\nsimulations are performed in order to estimate model convergence rates and to test\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov model in the more realistic double gyre wind forcing experiment.\n\nFinally, the main conclusions and final remarks are summarized in Section 6.\n\n17\n\n\n\n2.2 Preliminaries\n\nLet ? ?

Then, we perform simulations of the tradi-\n\ntional double-gyre wind forcing experiment. The computational tests were made us-\n\ning the software FreeFem++[40]. The resulting nonlinear system was solved through\n\na newtonian iteration. Moreover, a multi-frontal Gauss LU factorization imple-\n\nmented in the package UMFPACK (provided with FreeFem++ software) was used\n\nas our linear solver.\n\n33\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Convergence rates\n\nFirst, we estimate convergence rates for the BV-Tikhonov model using\n\nan analytical solution and results produced in meshes with different spatial resolu-\n\ntion. We calculate convergence rates using the error at two successive values of h by\n\npostulating that e(h) = Ch? and solving for ? with ? = ln(e(h1)/e(h2))/ ln(h1/h2).\n\nSetting F = ?? exp[?2?\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt] cos ?x sin ?y and adopting ? = [0, 1]\u00d7\n\n[?1, 1], the following time dependent solution for BV (with homogeneous Dirichlet\n\nboundary conditions) is obtained\n\n? = exp\n[\n?\n\n2?2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y,\n\n? = 2?2 exp\n[\n?\n\n2?2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y\n\nwhich we use to estimate convergence rates for BV-Tikhonov model.\n\nWe use results obtained in regular rectangular meshes with h equal to\n\n1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64 and 1/128 to calculate the convergence rates for ?M/L = 0.02\n\nand Ro = 1.0. In all cases we chose ? = h and \u00b5 = 1, and the timestep was\n\nchosen in terms of h in order to balance the errors sources from the convergence\n\ntheorem. That is, for P1 elements and ? = h, the L\n2(0,T; H1(?)) vorticity error\n\nand L?(0,T; H1(?)) streamfunction error from the theorem is O(?t2 +h), and thus\n\nwe chose ?t =\n?\nh (but slightly rounded so that ?t evenly divided T), and thus here\n\nwe expect first order convergence in these norms as ?t, h ? 0. For P2 elements,\n\nwe chose ?t = h, and expect second order convergence of these norms.\n\nConvergence rates for BV-Tikhonov model are presented in Table 2.1.\n\nFrom the table, we observe that convergence rates approach the expected estimates\n\nfor the given norms in the convergence theorem both for P1 and P2 elements.\n\n34\n\n\n\nElement h?1 ?w ?wh?2,1 Rate ?w ?wh??,0 Rate ?? ??h?2,1 Rate\nP1 4 24.189 1.9868 2.1732\n\n(?t =\n?\nh) 8 12.376 0.97 0.61369 1.69 1.0117 1.10\n\n16 6.1545 1.01 0.16167 1.92 0.39299 1.36\n32 3.0614 1.01 0.041218 1.97 0.16706 1.23\n64 1.5259 1.00 0.010349 1.99 0.078803 1.08\n128 0.76181 1.00 0.002606 1.99 0.038768 1.02\n\nP2 4 6.3875 0.79216 1.7969\n(?t = h) 8 2.7885 1.20 0.28037 1.50 0.74236 1.23\n\n16 1.0076 1.47 0.078785 1.83 0.22489 1.72\n32 0.33616 1.58 0.020767 1.92 0.059414 1.92\n64 0.10476 1.68 0.0052803 1.98 0.059414 1.98\n128 0.02967 1.82 0.0013261 1.99 0.015067 1.99\n\nTable 2.1: Convergence rates for BV-Tikhonov model with ?M\nL\n\n= 0.02 and Ro = 1.0.\n\n2.5.2 Double gyre wind forcing experiment\n\nAccording to [37, 47], when BV equations are forced by a double gyre wind\n\nforcing in a rectangular basin and dissipation is weak, the instantaneous vorticity and\n\nstreamfunction fields are highly variable but their mean fields present a well defined four\n\ngyre pattern in which the two central gyres are driven by the wind and the northern and\n\nsouthern ends of the basin are driven by the eddy flux of potential vorticity. Moreover, the\n\nouter gyres are not a linear effect, instead it results from a mean balance between eddy\n\nflux of potential vorticity and wind forcing which is susceptible to destruction by excessive\n\ndissipation [47].\n\nThe double gyre wind forcing experiment has been used in several studies\n\nas a model of more realistic ocean dynamics. Besides, it has been used as an interesting\n\nbenchmark test in order to analyze new techniques to deal with turbulence in geophysical\n\nflows, e.g. [81, 47, 100]. In order to accomplish the double gyre wind forcing experiment,\n\nF is set to F0 sin(?y) where F0 = 1.\n\nHere we follow [100] and adopt the standard LES methodology: first we run\n\nthe double gyre wind forcing experiment in a high resolution simulation with BV model\n\n35\n\n\n\n(no treatment of turbulence). After we run several experiments in a coarse resolution mesh\n\nwith BV model and BV-Tikhonov model and compare them with the high resolution BV\n\nmodel solution as reference.\n\nFollowing [37, 81, 47, 100], we run simulations in different regular triangular\n\nmeshes in the dimensionless rectangular domain [0, 1]\u00d7 [?1, 1] considering h = 1/4 (which\n\ncorresponds to a grid with 4 \u00d7 8 squares), 1/8 (8 \u00d7 16), 1/16 (16 \u00d7 32), 1/32 (32 \u00d7 64) and\n1/64 (64 \u00d7 128) where h is the mesh-width. Figure 2.1 presents the coarsest mesh used in\n\nexperiments.\n\nFigure 2.1: Mesh with h = 1/4 which corresponds to a grid with 4 \u00d7 8 squares.\n\nExperiments were made starting from t = 0 up until t = 100 (corresponding\n\nto 56.6 years in dimensional units) as in [100]. In this and in the next section we present\n\nfigures of the average fields of streamfunction (?) and potential vorticity (given by q =\n\nRo?+y) calculated using results from t = 20 until 100 as in [100]. Moreover, we considered\n\ntwo interesting cases: i) ?M/L = 0.02 and Ro = 0.0016 (which is presented in [100]) and ii)\n\n?M/L = 0.01 and Ro = 0.0002.\n\nFirstly, we present the results obtained in the experiment using ?M/L = 0.02\n\nand Ro = 0.0016. In this case, the high spatial resolution experiment with the BV model\n\nwas made in a regular rectangular mesh with 16,384 triangular elements (33,153 degrees\n\nof freedom) corresponding to a grid with spatial resolution of 64 \u00d7 128 squares. Thus,\n\nthe mean length of the triangle edge is about 0.015 which permits to resolve the Munk\n\nscale (?M ). Solutions for the high resolution experiment using ?t = 0.001 are presented in\n\n36\n\n\n\nFigures 2.2(a) and 2.3(a). We observe that the high resolution solution produced by our\n\nFE scheme can reproduce the four gyre pattern found by [100] in their DNS experiment.\n\nNow, we evaluate the results produced with BV model in the coarse 4 \u00d7 8\n\nmesh using the timestep ?t = 0.001. In Figures 2.2(b) and 2.3(b) we can see, when mesh\n\nresolution is reduced (h is increased), the BV model streamfunction solution become more\n\ndiffusive causing the degeneration of the four gyres pattern in two gyres, as is also observed\n\nin [81, 47, 100]. According to [47], in this case the grid resolution is too coarse to resolve\n\nthe viscous boundary layer (Munk scale of 0.02).\n\nNext, we present the solutions obtained with the BV-Tikhonov model (?t =\n\n0.001). Figures 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) present the streamfunction field and Fig-\n\nures 2.3(c), 2.3(d), 2.3(e) and 2.3(f) the vorticity field produced with the BV-Tikhonov\n\nmodel for ? = h and \u00b5 equal to 1, 1\n4\n, 1\n\n16\nand 1\n\n64\n, respectively. We can see that the BV-\n\nTikhonov model can recover the four gyre pattern in this experiment for all tested values\n\nof the \u00b5 parameter. However, the BV-Tikhonov solution can be dramatically different\n\ndepending on the value of the \u00b5 parameter. For example, the BV-Tikhonov provides an\n\naccurate solution in the coarse mesh when \u00b5 = 1\n16\n\nand \u00b5 = 1\n64\n\n, but for \u00b5 = 1 and \u00b5 = 1\n4\n\nsome discrepancies are observed in the vorticity field.\n\nComputational times for the BV model in the fine and coarse mesh and for\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov model in the coarse mesh are presented in Table 2.2. We see that the\n\nBV-Tikhonov algorithm is able to recover the four gyre pattern in the coase mesh and it\n\nis significant faster than solving the BV model in the fine mesh.\n\nFine Coarse alpha \u00b5 = 1/4 \u00b5 = 1/16 \u00b5 = 1/64\n\n9.82e5 2.05e3 4.5e3 4.2e3 4.5e3 4.5e3\n\nTable 2.2: Computational time (in seconds) obtained for Ro = 0.0016 in the fine (64\u00d7128)\nand coarse (4 \u00d7 8) mesh with the BV model and in the coarse mesh (4 \u00d7 8)\nwith BV-Tikhonov model.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of different choices of the \u00b5 parameter on\n\nthe solution of the BV-Tikhonov model. Figure 2.4(a) presents the time evolution of the\n\ncumulative moving average kinect energy for different values of the \u00b5 parameter in the\n\n37\n\n\n\nabove mentioned experiment. We found for all values of \u00b5 parameter, solutions have more\n\nenergy than the high spatial resolution solution (with BV model). Moreover, in Figure\n\n2.2 we saw that increasing \u00b5 produces an intensification of the four gyre pattern. Thus\n\nsolution can be very sensitive to the value of \u00b5 parameter tending to be more energetic\n\nwhen \u00b5 is larger. The intensification of the four gyre pattern in the BV-? model was\n\nalso observed in [47] and according to [82] is attributed to the enhancement of the inverse\n\nenergy cascade in the model.\n\nWe also tested the BV and BV-Tikhonov model in a 16 \u00d7 32 mesh using\n\n?t = 0.001. Results obtained with the coarse BV model are presented in Figures 2.5(b)\n\nand 2.6(b). In this case the BV model solution does not degenerates in two gyres, but\n\ninstead the gyres are intensified in comparison with the reference solution. In Figures\n\n2.5(c), 2.5(d), 2.5(e) and 2.5(f) we present the streamfunction fields and in Figures 2.6(c),\n\n2.6(d), 2.6(e) and 2.6(f) the vorticity fields obtained with the BV-Tikhonov model for\n\n? = h and \u00b5 equal to 1, 1\n4\n, 1\n\n16\nand 1\n\n32\n, respectively. In this case, we also observed that\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov solution can be very sensitive to different values of the \u00b5 parameter.\n\nFor example, when \u00b5 = 1 or \u00b5 = 1\n4\n\nthe gyres in the BV-Tikhonov solution are intensified\n\nin comparison with the high resolution and coarse BV solutions. However, for \u00b5 = 1\n16\n\nand \u00b5 = 1\n64\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov model solutions are more similar with the high resolution\n\nsolution than the coarse BV model solution. Run times for the BV model in the fine and\n\ncoarse mesh (16 \u00d7 32) and for the BV-Tikhonov model in the coarse mesh (16 \u00d7 32) are\n\npresented in Table 2.3. In this experiment we see again that the BV-Tikhonov solution,\n\nas well as recovering the expected four gyre pattern, it is significant faster than solving\n\nthe BV model in the fine mesh.\n\nFine Coarse alpha \u00b5 = 1/4 \u00b5 = 1/16 \u00b5 = 1/64\n\n9.82e5 3.69e4 9.19e4 9.00e4 8.73e4 8.99e4\n\nTable 2.3: Computational time (in seconds) obtained for Ro = 0.0016 in the fine (64\u00d7128)\nand coarse (16\u00d732) mesh with the BV model and in the coarse mesh (16\u00d732)\nwith BV-Tikhonov model. The experiments were made in a Intel\u00ae CoreTM i7\n\n3.70 GHz.\n\n38\n\n\n\nFinally, we present the results obtained in a experiment using ?M/L = 0.01\n\nand Ro = 0.0002. In this test, the high resolution solution is simulated in a 50 \u00d7 100\n\nmesh (8,385 degrees of freedom and 4,096 triangles) using ?t = 0.001. Figures 2.7(a) and\n\n2.8(a) present the reference solution. Here the streamfunction solution presents a distinct\n\nsix gyre pattern. This pattern is also very sensitive to the mesh resolution, as we can\n\nsee in Figures 2.7(b) and 2.8(b) in which the coarse (8 \u00d7 16) BV model solution using\n\nthe same ?t is presented. That is, in this case the BV model streamfunction solution\n\ndegenerates in two gyres and the vorticity field becomes very noisy. On the other hand,\n\nthe coarse mesh BV-Tikhonov streamfunction solutions (also for ?t = 0.001) for \u00b5 equal\n\nto 1, 1\n4\n, 1\n\n16\nand 1\n\n64\nare presented in Figures 2.7(c), 2.7(d), 2.7(e) and 2.7(f), respectively,\n\nand their respective vorticity fields in Figures 2.8(c), 2.8(d), 2.8(e) and 2.8(f). We can\n\nsee that the BV-Tikhonov solution can recover the external gyres for all tested values of\n\nthe \u00b5 parameter. However, like in the previous experiments, the BV-Tikhonov solution is\n\nalso dramatically dependent on the choice of \u00b5 value. For example, when \u00b5 = 1 (BV-?\n\nmodel) the gyres are slighly intensified and displaced in relation to the high resolution\n\nsolution. Nevertheless, when \u00b5 = 1\n16\n\nand \u00b5 = 1\n64\n\nthey are in the right place with the\n\ncorrect magnitude. Moreover, the vorticity field is somewhat less noisy than the coarse\n\nBV model solution.\n\nTo sum up, in this experiment we observed that the BV-Tikhonov model\n\ncan retrieve the four gyre pattern in all tested cases, but solutions can be dramatically\n\nimproved by the choice of the \u00b5 parameter. We showed that the BV-? model (\u00b5 = 1)\n\nprovides solutions with more kinetic energy in comparison with the reference solution.\n\nConsequently, its solutions presents an intensified four gyre pattern. However, this problem\n\ncan be fixed by choosing \u00b5 &lt;1 in the BV-Tikhonov model. It is in agreement with the\n\nconvergence analysis presented above, wherein it was shown that the BV-Tikhonov model\n\nhas a second order consistency error which also depends on \u00b5 (see Corollary 2.1). We\n\nbelieve when \u00b5 = 1 and the mesh is coarse (the meshwidth h is large and, consequently,\n\nthe ? parameter), the consistency error can affect the BV-Tikhonov solution, probably\n\nthrough the filter effect on the large to moderate scales (the resolved scales), but when\n\n\u00b5 &lt;1 this kind of error is partially controlled enabling the model to produce solutions\n\n39\n\n\n\nmore similar with the reference solution. It is also insightful to analyze the D\u00b5F operator\n\nin the wave number space given by D?\u00b5F = (1 + \u00b5k\n2)?1 where k is the wave number. In\n\nFigure 2.4(b) we present the transfer function of D\u00b5F operator for ? = 1 and \u00b5 equal to\n\n1, 1\n4\n, 1\n\n16\nand 1\n\n64\n. In this figure we see that the resolved scale is less affected by the D\u00b5F\n\noperator when \u00b5 is decreased, at the expense of less regularization. We do not investigate\n\nan optimal value for the \u00b5 parameter, but we observed that values between \u00b5 = 1\n16\n\nand\n\n\u00b5 = 1\n64\n\nproduce the best results and when \u00b5 is smaller than 1\n64\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov solution\n\ntends to the coarse BV solution. Thus, the BV-? model can retrieve the four gyre pattern\n\nin coarse meshes in which the BV model solution degenerates. However, the BV-Tikhonov\n\nmodel improves the BV-? in the sense that more accurate solutions can only be obtained\n\nwhen \u00b5 &lt;1, at the expense of less reguralization, which is related to the consistency error\n\nin the regularized model and the undesirable filter effect on the large to moderate scales.\n\n2.6 Conclusions\n\nGeophysical flow simulations, due to their high Reynolds number, are presently\n\nunfeasible with the available computational resources. Regularized models are simplified\n\nmodels designed to reduce the degrees of freedom in simulations by virtue of small changes\n\nin the original equations, which shorten the energy cascade enabling the use of less refined\n\nmeshes. In this article we studied the Tikhonov-Lavrentiev regularization applied to the\n\nBV model of geophysical flows. Firstly, we proposed a Crank-Nicolson/FEM algorithm for\n\nthe BV-Tikhonov model and proved it is unconditionally stable and optimally convergent.\n\nThen, theoretical convergence rates were confirmed through numerical simulations using\n\nan analytical solution. Also, we tested the BV-Tikhonov algorithm in the more realistic\n\ndouble gyre wind forcing experiment. We showed it recovers the expected pattern in the\n\ncase in which the coarse mesh BV model solution degenerates. Moreover, we showed that\n\na dramatic improve over the BV-? model (\u00b5 = 1) can be obtained by a carefull choice\n\nof the \u00b5 parameter in the BV-Tikhonov model. We believe it is due to the consistency\n\nerror caused by alpha terms which, despite being second order according to the presented\n\n40\n\n\n\nconvergence analysis, can be controlled decreasing the \u00b5 parameter in the BV-Tikhonov\n\nmodel, at the expense of less regularization.\n\nA natural next step is to investigate the Van Cittert approximate deconvo-\n\nlution technique applied to the BV-? model, which permits to control the order of the\n\nconsistency error in the regularization model.

One of the simplest models which can be used to represent these\n\nmeso and large scale flows is the barotropic vorticity (BV) model of geophysical flows,\n\nwhich is given in dimensionless form by [47, 100]\n\nRo ??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F, (3.1a)\n\n?? = ??, (3.1b)\n\nwhere ? is the vorticity, ? is the streamfunction, J(?,?) =\n??\n?x\n\n??\n?y\n? ??\n\n?y\n??\n?x\n\nis the Jacobian,\n\nRo is the Rossby number, ?M is the Munk scale, L is the length scale and F is the forcing\n\nterm. The BV model is commonly used in oceanography to study midlatitude ocean\n\ncirculation, and it can also be extended to multilayer in order to describe the vertical\n\nmotions in the ocean [78]. It has recently been used in studies involving data assimilation\n\n[113, 21], climate [95, 73, 36] and oceanic processes [12, 108].\n\nDespite its simplified form (compared to, e.g., the primitive equations), the\n\nBV system still contains a very large range of active scales, and it is not computationally\n\nfeasible to perform simulations that resolve them all, particularly when long time inte-\n\ngration is necessary (e.g. climate modeling [78]). Traditionally, simulations are done on\n\ncoarse meshes and essentially dissipative techniques such as eddy viscosity parametriza-\n\ntions have been used to model the under-resolved scales of the flow. However, according\n\nto [47], increasing artificial viscosity tends to reduce variability, and nonlinear structures\n\n1The content of this chapter is coauthored by Professor Carolina C. Manica and Professor Leo\nG.

We study a regularization / large eddy\n\nsimulation (LES) approach to this problem, which is to try instead to resolve only the\n\nlarge scales of the flow, and to model the effect of the small scales on the large scales.\n\nEven though this is a two dimensional model, it is based on the vorticity equation, which\n\nis known to have a forward enstrophy cascade, and thus this approach is valid in this\n\ncontext.\n\nThe model we study herein was first proposed by Khouider and Titi in [59],\n\nand is a reduction of the well-known (simplified) Bardina model to two dimensions with\n\nthe beta-plane approximation. We refer to it as BV-Bardina, and it can be written as\n\nRo\n??\n\n?t\n+ RoJ\n\n(\n?,?\n\n)\n?\n??\n\n?x\n?\n(?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F, (3.2)\n\n?? = ??, (3.3)\n\n??2?? + ? = ?. (3.4)\n\nWe will show in section 3.1.1 the derivation of the system (3.2)-(3.4) from the (simplified)\n\nBardina model in velocity-pressure variables.\n\nThe main objective of this chapter is to study a Crank-Nicolson-in-time,\n\nfinite element (FE) in space algorithm for approximating solutions to the BV-Bardina\n\nmodel. After proposing the scheme, we analyze its stability and convergence, and prove it\n\nis unconditionally stable with respect to the timestep size, and that it converges optimally\n\nin space and time. Moreover, we estimate convergence rates using numerical simulations\n\nand perform the benchmark double-gyre wind forcing experiment to evaluate the perfor-\n\nmance of BV-Bardina on meshes with coarse spatial resolution. To our knowledge, this is\n\nthe first numerical analysis of a numerical scheme for a regularized/LES BV-type model, al-\n\nthough a significant amount of work has been done on the related vorticity-streamfunction\n\nformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (see [4] and references therein). Steady state\n\nanalysis of numerical schemes for BV and related models has been performed in [26, 27],\n\nbut of course analysis of the time dependent schemes has more (and somewhat different)\n\ncomplexities. Related models have been studied from a computational point of view using\n\napproximate deconvolution modeling [100, 99], and with the NS-?-derived model called\n\nBV-? [47], and have enjoyed some computational success. We believe the advantage of\n\n50\n\n\n\nBV-Bardina over approximate deconvolution modeling is in its simplicity, as there is only\n\none filtering procedure that needs performed. BV-? is similar in form to BV-Bardina,\n\nand we note that the only difference is in BV-? the Jacobian term has the form J\n(\n?,?\n\n)\n.\n\nHence BV-Bardina can be considered as having more regularization than BV-?. Due\n\nto their similarity, we compare solutions produced by the two models in our numerical\n\nexperiments section, and find that BV-Bardina gives better coarse mesh results on the\n\ndouble-gyre wind forcing benchmark test. Moreover, similar numerical analysis to that\n\nperformed herein can be extended to BV-? schemes, which to our knowledge has not been\n\nstudied.\n\nThe chapter is organized as follows: Section 3.1.1 presents the BV-Bardina\n\nmodel derivation, and Section 3.2 introduces some mathematical preliminaries. Section\n\n3.3 presents the numerical scheme and its stability analysis. Section 3.4 presents the\n\nconvergence analysis. Numerical convergence rates tests and the double gyre wind forcing\n\nexperiment results are given in Section 3.5. Finally, some conclusions and remarks are\n\nsummarized in Section 3.6.\n\n3.1.1 Barotropic Vorticity-Bardina model\n\nWe show here how the BV-Bardina model is obtained from the simplified\n\nBardina model. The Bardina model emerged in 1980 as a particular closure model to ap-\n\nproximate the Reynolds stress tensor introduced by Bardina et al. [3]. It was later studied\n\nanalytically in a simplified form by Layton and Lewandowski [62], and Cao, Lunasin and\n\nTiti [15]. Following [15], the simplified Bardina model can be written as\n\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?u???u = ??p,\n\n?\u00b7u = ?\u00b7u = 0,\n\n??2?u + u = u,\n\nwhere ? > 0 is the filtering radius. Using the identity u \u00b7?u = ? |u|\n2\n\n2\n? u \u00d7?\u00d7 u, we\n\nhave that\n\n?u\n\n?t\n?u\u00d7?\u00d7u???u = ??\n\n(\np +\n|u|2\n\n2\n\n)\n. (3.5)\n\n51\n\n\n\nRestricting now to two dimensions (0 in the z direction), we note that by a vector identity,\n\nsince u is divergence free, we have that ?\u00d7\n[\nu\u00d7\n\n(\n?\u00d7u\n\n)]\n= ?u \u00b7?\n\n(\n?\u00d7u\n\n)\n. Now taking\n\ncurl of equation (3.5) and the filter equation provides\n\n?(?\u00d7u)\n?t\n\n?u \u00b7?(?\u00d7u) ???(?\u00d7u) = 0. (3.6)\n\nLetting ? =\n(\n?\u00d7 u\n\n)\n\u00b7 k?, and ? be the streamfunction associated with u, we have the\n\nsystem (after applying curl on the filter equation),\n\n??\n\n?t\n+ J\n\n(\n?,?\n\n)\n???? = 0\n\n?? = ??\n\n??2?? + ? = ?,\n\nwhere ? is the filtered vorticity. Now using the beta plane approximation for the Coriolis\n\nterm and simplifying, we arrive at the BV-Bardina model\n\nRo\n??\n\n?t\n+ RoJ\n\n(\n?,?\n\n)\n?\n??\n\n?x\n?\n(?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F,\n\n?? = ??,\n\n??2?? + ? = ?.\n\n3.2 Notation and preliminaries\n\nLet ? ?

(3.17)\n\n3.3 Numerical Scheme for BV-Bardina\n\nFollowing [100, 47] we consider the model with slip boundary conditions\n\nfor velocity, which translates into the homogeneous Dirichlet condition ?|?? = 0, and\n\nthe impermeability condition ?|?? = 0. As in [47], we consider the additional homo-\n\ngeneous Dirichlet condition ?|?? = 0 in the filter equation, which allows inversion\n\nto be performed uniquely.\n\nOur motivation for studying the BV and BV-Bardina models is the\n\nsearch for efficient, unconditionally stable and accurate methods for the simulation\n\nof geophysical flows. We present now a finite element discretization in space, together\n\nwith Crank-Nicolson time discretization. As it is common in such discretizations,\n\nwe denote the half timesteps by vn+\n1\n2 := v\n\nn+vn+1\n\n2\nand tn+\n\n1\n2 := t\n\nn+tn+1\n\n2\n.\n\nAlgorithm 3.1 (Crank-Nicolson BV-Bardina model).

The first numerical test is to confirm the predicted convergence\n\nrates, and the second tests the model\u2019s ability to find accurate coarse mesh solution\n\nto a double gyre wind forcing benchmark test. We use the software FreeFem++[40]\n\nto perform the computational tests; Newton\u2019s method is used to resolve the nonlin-\n\near problems at each timestep, and we use UMFPACK to solve the linear systems.\n\nWe note that we also tested linearized analogues of the proposed scheme, and found\n\noverall worse results, particularly on the double gyre benchmark test.\n\n3.5.1 Convergence rate confirmation\n\nNow we estimate the convergence rates for the BV-Bardina scheme\n\nusing a known analytical solution. Using ? = (0, 1) \u00d7 (?1, 1), T = 1, and setting\n\nF = ?? exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\ncos ?x sin ?y, we obtain the following time dependent\n\nanalytical solution for BV (with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions):\n\n? = exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y,\n\n? = 2?2 exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y.\n\nTo estimate convergence rates, we considered h = 1/4 (which corresponds to a grid\n\nwith 4 \u00d7 8 squares), 1/8 (8 \u00d7 16), 1/16 (16 \u00d7 32), 1/32 (32 \u00d7 64) and 1/64 (64 \u00d7 128)\n\nwhere h is the mesh-width. Figure 3.1 presents the coarsest mesh used in this\n\nexperiment. In the remainder of the text we will refer to our meshes as n\u00d7 2n for\n\nn = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. In all cases we chose ? = h, and the timestep was chosen in terms\n\nof h in order to balance the errors sources from the convergence theorem. That is,\n\nfor P1 elements and ? = h, the L\n2(0,T; H1(?)) vorticity error and L?(0,T; H1(?))\n\nstreamfunction error from the theorem is O(?t2 + h), and thus we chose ?t =\n?\nh\n\n(but slightly rounded so that ?t evenly divided T), and thus here we expect first\n\norder convergence in these norms as ?t, h ? 0. For P2 elements, we chose ?t = h,\n\nand expect second order convergence of these norms.\n\n65\n\n\n\nTable 3.1 presents the errors and convergence rates obtained for de-\n\ncreasing h and ?t, using ?M\nL\n\n= 0.02 and Ro = 1.0. From the table we observe the\n\nconvergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution is optimal and agrees\n\nwith the convergence theory presented in this chapter, for both choices of elements.\n\nFigure 3.1: Mesh with h = 1/4 which corresponds to a grid with 4x8 squares.\n\nElement h?1 ?w ?wh?2,1 Rate ?w ?wh??,0 Rate ?? ??h??,1 Rate\nP1 4 186.05 14.604 2.876\n\n(?t =\n?\nh) 8 53.756 1.79 3.8843 1.91 1.388 1.05\n\n16 18.219 1.56 0.9873 1.98 0.6898 1.01\n32 7.592 1.26 0.2479 1.99 0.3447 1.00\n64 3.528 1.11 0.06205 2.00 0.17235 1.00\n128 1.717 1.04 0.01552 2.00 0.08617 1.00\n\nP2 4 76.697 17.162 0.18342\n(?t = h) 8 19.176 2.00 4.3026 2.00 0.047225 1.96\n\n16 4.8116 1.99 1.0761 2.00 0.011906 1.99\n32 1.2159 1.98 0.26905 2.00 0.0029831 2.00\n64 0.3067 1.99 0.067264 2.00 0.0007462 2.00\n\nTable 3.1: Convergence rates for BV-Bardina model with ?M\nL\n\n= 0.02 and Ro = 1.0.\n\n3.5.2 Double gyre wind forcing experiment\n\nWe now test the model on the double gyre wind forcing benchmark test.\n\nThis problem has been used as a model of more realistic ocean dynamics in several\n\nstudies, and has also been used as a benchmark test to analyze new techniques to\n\ndeal with turbulence in geophysical flows [81, 47, 100]. When the BV equations\n\n66\n\n\n\nare forced by a double gyre wind forcing in a rectangular basin and dissipation is\n\nweak, the instantaneous field of vorticity and streamfunction are highly variable.\n\nHowever, the mean fields show a well defined four gyre pattern in which the two\n\ncentral gyres are driven by the wind with its same orientation, and the northern\n\nand southern ends of the basin circulate in opposite direction, being driven by the\n\neddy flux of potential vorticity [37, 47]. The dominant balance is between the wind\n\nforcing and the divergence of the eddy flux of potential vorticity with dissipation\n\nplaying only a minor role. The outer gyres are not a linear effect but, rather, are a\n\nresult of a mean balance between eddy flux of potential vorticity and wind forcing.\n\nHowever this distinctive four gyre pattern is susceptible to destruction by excessive\n\ndissipation [47].\n\nThe setup of this problem is as follows [100]. The domain is ? =\n\n(0, 1) \u00d7 (?1, 1), the forcing is F = sin(?y), ?M/L = 0.02 and Ro = 0.0016 (which\n\ncorresponds to Re = 200). The computations were run until T = 100, and time\n\naverages were taken from T = 20 to T = 100. We follow [100] and adopt standard\n\nLES methodology: first we run a high resolution simulation with the BV-model\n\n(no treatment of turbulence), and then we run several experiments using coarse\n\nresolution with the BV and BV-Bardina models and compare them with the high\n\nresolution BV model solution as reference. For comparison, we will also run the\n\nrelated BV-? model, and compute solutions to it using a scheme analogous to the\n\nBV-Bardina scheme. All computations in this section use P2 elements.\n\nThe high spatial resolution computation with the BV-model was made\n\nusing a uniform triangular mesh with 16,384 triangles (33,153 degrees of freedom,\n\ncorresponding to a grid with 64 \u00d7 128 squares), and thus the mean length of a\n\ntriangle edge is about 0.015, which is smaller than the Munk scale (?M ), and timestep\n\n?t = 0.001. Solutions for the high resolution experiment are presented respectively\n\nin Figures 3.2(a) and 3.3(a), as time averaged streamfunction and potential vorticity,\n\nrespectively. We observe that the high resolution solution produced by our FE\n\n67\n\n\n\nscheme matches that of [100] very well, and we note it does reproduce the four gyre\n\npattern observed by [100] in their DNS experiment.\n\nWe next ran the BV (no regularization) on a coarse analogous mesh\n\nwith 1,024 triangles and 2,145 degrees of freedom, corresponding to a grid with\n\n16\u00d732 squares (we use this same coarse mesh for all coarse mesh experiments), and\n\n?t = 0.001. In figures 3.2(b) and 3.3(b) we present respectively the streamfunction\n\nand vorticity average solutions obtained in the coarse mesh. This figures clearly\n\nshow that solutions are negatively affected by decreasing the mesh resolution. More\n\nspecifically, in figure 3.2(b) the four gyre pattern is dramatically intensified when\n\ncompared with the high resolution solution, and in the vorticity field, figure 3.3(b),\n\nwe observe that solution has significant oscillations.\n\nNext we present the results of running the BV model on the coarse\n\nmesh using artificial viscosity, that is, we increase\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nfrom 0.02 to 0.04, still using\n\n?t = 0.001. Results are shown in figure 3.2(c) and 3.3(c), and it is clear that the\n\nsolution is dramatically different from the high resolution\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n=0.02 solution. This\n\nis similar to what was reported in [37, 47], since the four gyre pattern (figure 3.2(c))\n\ndegenerates in two gyres due to the excess of dissipation. We also observe that the\n\nvorticity field (figures 3.3(c)) also degenerates with respect to the high resolution\n\nsolution.\n\nFinally, we present our coarse mesh results obtained with the BV-\n\nBardina model (? = 1\n64\n\n) in figures 3.2(d) and 3.3(d), and for BV-? in 3.2(e) and\n\n3.3(e). Both of these models successfully predict the four-gyre pattern, however by\n\ncomparing the intensities of the streamfunction, we observe the BV-Bardina model\n\nto be more accurate. The BV-Bardina and BV-? plots of filtered vorticity have\n\nsimilar accuracy.\n\nRun times for the BV model in the fine and coarse mesh (16\u00d732) and\n\nfor BV-? and BV-Bardina in the coarse mesh (16 \u00d7 32) are presented in Table 3.2.\n\n68\n\n\n\nIn this experiment we see again that the BV-Tikhonov solution, as well as recovering\n\nthe expected four gyre pattern, it is significant faster than solving the BV model in\n\nthe fine mesh.\n\nFine Coarse Art.

We have used ? = 0.1.\n\nThe leapfrog-RA scheme has the advantage of decouple the vorticity\n\nequation from the streamfunction and filter equations, but on the other hand it has a\n\ntimestep restriction due to its conditionally stability. We tested the leapfrog-RA ver-\n\nsion of the BV-Bardina model and it has only run without blow up for ?t = 0.0001,\n\n69\n\n\n\nwhich is 1/10 of the timestep used in the Crank-Nicolson version. However, both\n\nschemes took the same computational time to attain similar solutions. Thus we\n\nbelieve that Crank-Nicolson version of BV-Bardina can be more useful than the\n\nleapfrog-RA version because it is unconditionally stable. In real geophysical appli-\n\ncations, the use of unconditionally stable schemes can avoid the use of artificial\n\nviscosity to stabilize the model which would reduce the convergence order of the nu-\n\nmerical scheme. This is specially recommended in the case of a non-dissipative\n\nregularization, as the Bardina regularization.\n\nThus, for this experiment, we conclude that both BV-Bardina and BV-\n\n?, correctly predict the four gyre pattern on the coarse mesh where BV is inaccurate,\n\nwith BV-Bardina being somewhat more accurate that BV-?. The artificial viscosity\n\nmodel was unable to predict the four gyre pattern.\n\n3.6 Conclusions\n\nIn this work we proposed a Crank-Nicolson/FEM discretization for a\n\nBardina regularization of the BV model for geophysical flows. We proved that the\n\nscheme is unconditionally stable and optimally convergent. Numerical simulations\n\nwere provided that verified the predicted convergence rates, and showed the effec-\n\ntiveness of the model/scheme at finding good coarse mesh solutions for the double\n\ngyre wind forcing benchmark test. Moreover, on the double gyre test, results were\n\nfound to be better than the related BV-? model. In the same way as was made\n\nfor the approximate deconvolution-BV model ([100] and [99]), we intend in a future\n\nwork to extent the BV-Bardina model for two layers in order to consider the first\n\nbaroclinic mode, which will allow us to evaluate this regularization in a situation\n\nmore similar with the true threedimensional ocean dynamic.\n\n70\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(a) BV (high res.), ?min= -1.39, ?max=1.39\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(b) BV (Coarse), ?min=-2.281, ?max=2.361\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(c) BV + Art.

MODEL\n\nWITH VAN CITTERT APPROXIMATE\n\nDECONVOLUTION1\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nAccurate simulations of geophysical flows are critically important in un-\n\nderstanding climate change and ocean and weather forecast. Furthermore, they can\n\nassist in prediction of biological and pollutant transport, oil exploration, and many\n\nother applications. One of the simplest nonlinear models to simulate a geophysical\n\nflow is the Barotropic Vorticity (BV) model, which, in dimensionless, form is given\n\nby [47, 100]\n\nRo??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F, (4.1a)\n\n?? = ??, (4.1b)\n\nwhere ? is the vorticity, ? is the streamfunction, J(?,?) = ??\n?x\n\n??\n?y\n? ??\n\n?y\n??\n?x\n\nis the\n\nJacobian, Ro is the Rossby number, ?M is the Munk scale, L is the length scale and\n\nF is the forcing term. The BV model is widely used to study the midlatitude, wind-\n\ndriven ocean circulation, and it recently has been used in studies involving data\n\nassimilation [113, 21, 58], climate [95, 73, 36] and oceanic and atmosphere processes\n\n[12, 108, 96].\n\nDespite its simplicity, the BV model is very sensitive to the mesh res-\n\nolution [37, 81, 47, 100], making full representation of the solution computationally\n\nexpensive. This becomes critical when long time integration is necessary, as in\n\nclimate modeling. Traditionally, simulations are done on coarse meshes and (essen-\n\n1The content of this chapter is coauthored by Professor Carolina C. Manica and was published\nin Volume 5, Number 4, Pages 317-338 (2014) of the International Journal of Numerical Analysis\nand Modelling, Series B, with the title Improving numerical accuracy in a regularized Barotropic\nVorticity model of geophysical flow.\n\n73\n\n\n\ntially) dissipative techniques such as eddy viscosity parametrizations have been used\n\nto model the under-resolved scales of the flow. However, according to [47], increas-\n\ning artificial viscosity tends to reduce variability, and nonlinear structures can be\n\ndestroyed by excess of dissipation [37, 47]. Thus some methods such as Approximate\n\nDeconvolution Modeling [100, 99], Barotropic Vorticity-? (BV-?) [82, 81, 47] and\n\nBarotropic Vorticity-Bardina [59] have been developed with success to improve ac-\n\ncuracy and reduce the degrees of freedom in computational simulations. The BV-?\n\nmodel is a regularization of the BV model proposed in [47] that allows a significant\n\nreduction of degrees of freedom in simulations. In BV-?, the nonlinearity is altered\n\nso that the flow at length scales that are smaller than the alpha length scale are\n\nnonlinearly removed by motions at the larger scales. Thus there is seemingly no\n\nneed to introduce additional dissipative terms or increase the viscosity coefficient,\n\nwhich is often done in the BV equations. The BV-? model is given by\n\nRo??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F, (4.2a)\n\n?? = ??, (4.2b)\n\n??2?? + ? = ?, (4.2c)\n\nwhere ? is the filtered vorticity and ? is the filter length scale. A more complete\n\ndescription of BV-? is presented in [47].\n\nDespite being physically accurate, the BV-? model naturally has a con-\n\nsistency error from the BV model. It is clear from (4.2) that one cannot expect\n\naccuracy better than O(?2). Since frequently ? = O(h), the BV-? model is often\n\nonly second order accurate. Following [76], we attempt to fix the consistency error\n\nin the BV-? model by increasing its accuracy through the van Cittert method of\n\napproximate deconvolution [107, 1, 106]. The method constructs a family DN of\n\napproximate inverses to the filter F as the truncation of the nonconvergent formal\n\n74\n\n\n\npower series F?1 =\n??\nn=0\n\n(I ?F)n:\n\nDN =\nN?\nn=0\n\n(I ?F)n.\n\nIn [93], it is shown how to apply the deconvolution operator in the\n\nNavier-Stokes-? to achieve accuracy O(?2N+2), where N is the order of deconvolu-\n\ntion. Thus we adopt the above mentioned approach and introduce the BV-? model\n\nwith deconvolution (BV-?-Deconvolution) by\n\nRo??\n?t\n\n+ RoJ(?,?) ? ??\n?x\n?\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n?? = F,\n\n?? = ?DN?,\n\n??2?? + ? = ?.\n\nThe BV-?-Deconvolution model, as we will show in the next sections,\n\nwill allow a reduction in the degrees of freedom in simulations but with a consistency\n\nerror O(?2N+2) when compared to the BV model.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 4.2 introduces a finite element\n\nscheme for BV-?-Deconvolution and some necessary notation and mathematical\n\npreliminaries. Section 4.3 presents the stability analysis of the proposed scheme.\n\nSection 4.4 presents the convergence analysis. Convergence rates are estimated and\n\nthe double gyre experiment is performed in Section 4.5. Finally, some conclusions\n\nand remarks are summarized in Section 4.6.\n\n4.2 The finite element scheme and preliminaries\n\nLet ? ?

Multiplying (4.1) by test functions and\n\nintegrating by parts we have the following variational formulation to the BV model:\n\nfind (?,?) ?

In the first we validate our computa-\n\ntional implementation and estimate convergence rates using an analytical solution.\n\nIn the second, we simulate the more realistic and traditional double-gyre wind forc-\n\ning benchmark. The software FreeFem++[40] was used to implement the proposed\n\nscheme. To solve the resulting nonlinear system, we used a Newtonian iteration\n\nat each timestep. In addition, a multi-frontal Gauss LU factorization implemented\n\nin the package UMFPACK (provided with FreeFem++ software) was used as our\n\nlinear solver.\n\n91\n\n\n\n4.5.1 Convergence rates verification\n\nNow we validate our computational implementation and confirm the\n\nconvergence analysis presented above using a known analytical solution to estimate\n\nconvergence rates. Considering the domain ? = (0, 1) \u00d7 (?1, 1), t ? (0, 1], and for\n\nF = ?? exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\ncos ?x sin ?y,\n\nthe BV model has the following time dependent analytical solution (with homoge-\n\nneous Dirichlet boundary conditions):\n\n? = exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y,\n\n? = 2?2 exp\n[\n? 2?\n\n2\n\nRo\n\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\nt\n]\n\nsin ?x sin ?y.\n\nUsing this known solution, convergence rates were estimated through simulations\n\nusing regular triangular meshes with h = 1\n4\n, h = 1\n\n8\n, h = 1\n\n16\n, h = 1\n\n32\n, h = 1\n\n64\nand\n\nh = 1\n128\n\n, where h is the mesh-width. Figure 4.1 presents the coarsest mesh used in\n\nthis experiment. In all cases we chose ? = h, and the timestep was chosen in terms\n\nof h in order to balance the error sources from the convergence theorem. That is,\n\nfor P1 elements and ? = h, the L\n2(0,T; H1(?)) vorticity error and L?(0,T; H1(?))\n\nstreamfunction error from the theorem are O(?t2 + h), and thus we chose ?t =\n?\nh\n\n(but slightly rounded so that ?t evenly divided T), and thus here we expect first\n\norder convergence in these norms as ?t, h ? 0. For P2 and P3 elements, we chose\n\n?t = h and ?t =\n?\nh3, and expect second and third order convergence in these\n\nnorms, respectively.\n\nTables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 present the errors and convergence rates obtained\n\nfor decreasing h and ?t, using ?M\nL\n\n= 0.02 and Ro = 1.0. From these tables we observe\n\nthat the convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution is optimal and\n\nagrees with the convergence theory presented above, for any choices of elements. We\n\nremind that, according to the convergence analysis presented in the latter section,\n\nfor N = 0, the L2(0,T; H1(?)) error is O(hk + h2), for N = 1 the L2(0,T; H1(?))\n\n92\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Mesh with h = 1/4 which corresponds to a grid with 4x8 squares.\n\nerror is O(hk +h4) and for N = 2, the L2(0,T; H1(?)) error is O(hk +h6), which are\n\nconfirmed by the convergence rates presented in the tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. That is,\n\nprovided a smooth solution, BV-?-D1 and BV-?-D2 will converge faster than the\n\nBV-?

This pattern\n\nis composed by two inner gyres, which are driven by the wind, and two extremal\n\ngyres, at the northern and southern ends of the basin, which are driven by the eddy\n\nflux of potential vorticity. Moreover, according to [47], the extremal gyres are not\n\na linear effect, but a result of a mean balance between the eddy flux of potential\n\nvorticity and wind forcing being susceptible to destruction by excessive dissipation.\n\nThe double gyre forcing experiment has been used as a model of more\n\nrealistic ocean dynamics in several studies, and recently it has been used as a bench-\n\n94\n\n\n\nElement h?1 ?w ?wh?2,1 Rate ?w ?wh??,0 Rate ?? ??h??,1 Rate\nP1 4 23.906 1.9666 1.4363\n\n(?t =\n?\nh) 8 12.184 0.97 0.5435 1.86 0.6239 1.20\n\n16 6.1012 1.00 0.14125 1.94 0.3086 1.02\n32 3.0489 1.00 0.03604 1.97 0.15422 1.00\n64 1.5232 1.00 0.0090846 1.99 0.077104 1.00\n128 0.76126 1.00 0.0022754 2.00 0.038553 1.00\n\nP2 4 4.5291 0.36528 0.9807\n(?t = h) 8 1.1333 2.00 0.059717 2.61 0.18122 2.44\n\n16 0.27668 2.03 0.0061093 3.29 0.020044 3.18\n32 0.081142 1.77 0.00058915 3.37 0.0031885 2.65\n64 0.025527 1.67 8.0004e-5 2.88 7.497e-4 2.09\n128 0.0071309 1.84 9.5087e-6 3.07 1.8665e-4 2.01\n\nP3 4 4.4873 0.38391 0.95793\n\n(?t =\n?\nh3) 8 0.86042 2.38 0.058728 2.71 0.17452 2.46\n\n16 0.077881 3.47 0.0055599 3.40 0.016097 3.44\n32 0.0068168 3.51 0.00039313 3.82 0.0011237 3.84\n64 0.00052529 3.70 2.5343e-5 3.96 7.2312e-5 3.96\n\nTable 4.3: Convergence rates for BV-?-D2 (N = 2) model with\n?M\nL\n\n= 0.02 and\nRo = 1.0.\n\nmark test to analyze new techniques to deal with turbulence in geophysical flows\n\n[81, 47, 100].

Next, we run several experiments in a coarse resolution mesh with BV\n\nmodel and BV-?-Deconvolution model and compare them with the high resolution\n\nBV model solution as reference.\n\nFollowing the experiments presented in [37, 81, 47, 100], we run simula-\n\ntions in different regular triangular meshes in the dimensionless rectangular domain\n\n(0, 1) \u00d7 (?1, 1) using P2 finite elements and consider meshes with different resolu-\n\ntions setting h = 1/4 (which corresponds to a grid with 4x8 squares), 1/8 (8x16), 1/16\n\n95\n\n\n\n(16x32), 1/32 (32x64) and 1/64 (64x128) where h is the mesh-width. In the remainder\n\nof this section we will refer to theses meshes as n\u00d7 2n for n = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n\nExperiments were made starting from t = 0 up until t = 100 as in [100]\n\nand we adopt ?t = 0.001 in all simulations. In this and in the next section we\n\npresent figures of the average fields of streamfunction (?) and potential vorticity\n\n(given by q = Ro? + y), calculated using results from t = 20 until 100 as in [100].\n\nFor the double gyre wind forcing experiment we considered two interesting cases: i)\n\n?M/L = 0.02 and Ro = 0.0016 (which is presented in [100]) and ii) ?M/L = 0.01 and\n\nRo = 0.0002.\n\n4.5.2.1 Experiment for Ro = 0.0016\n\nFirst, we present the results found for the double gyre experiment con-\n\nsidering the same case as in [100], that is, Ro = 0.0016 and\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n= 0.02. In Figures\n\n4.2(a) and 4.3(a) we present respectively the streamfunction and vorticity solutions\n\nobtained in the high resolution (64 \u00d7 128 mesh) experiment using the BV model.\n\nIn these figures we can see that the streamfunction and vorticity solutions obtained\n\nin this experiment are very similar with the results presented in [100] in their DNS\n\nexperiment.\n\nAs reported in [100, 47], decreasing the mesh resolution, the stream-\n\nfunction solution obtained with the BV model degenerates in two gyres as it can be\n\nseen in Figure 4.2(b). In this case, using the BV-? model (? = 1\n12\n\n) we can recover the\n\nfour gyre pattern (Figure 4.2(c)), but the streamfunction is intensified in comparison\n\nwith the streamfunction solution obtained in the high resolution experiment (Fig-\n\nure 4.2(a)) and the vorticity field is very noisy (Figure 4.3(c)). However, when we\n\nincrease the order in the deconvolution operator (Figures 4.2(d), 4.2(e) and 4.2(f)),\n\nwe can obtain more accurate solutions in comparison with the BV and BV-? model.\n\nIn this figures, clearly we can see that the larger is the deconvolution order, the\n\n96\n\n\n\nmore accurate is the BV-?-deconvolution solution. In the BV-?-deconvolution vor-\n\nticity solution we observe the same pattern (Figure 4.2(d), 4.2(e) and 4.2(f)). This\n\nimprovement is related to the consistency error present in the BV-?-deconvolution\n\nmodel that, according to our convergence analysis, has order 2N +2, which for larger\n\nvalues of N permits more accuracy in the solution.\n\nIn Table 4.4 we also present run times for the BV model in the fine\n\n(64\u00d7128) and coarse mesh (4\u00d78) and for BV-?-Deconvolution in the coarse mesh\n\n(4\u00d78) are presented. We see that, although the computational time is increased by\n\nincreasing the deconvolution order in the BV-?-Deconvolution model, it is significant\n\nfaster than solving the BV model in the fine mesh.\n\nFine Coarse alpha (D0) BV-?-D1 BV-?-D2 BV-?-D3\n9.82e5 2.50e3 4.5e3 9.4e3 1.73e4 2.98e4\n\nTable 4.4: Run times (in seconds) obtained for Ro = 0.0016 in the fine (64 \u00d7 128) and\ncoarse (4 \u00d7 8) mesh with the BV model and in the coarse mesh (4 \u00d7 8) with\nBV-?-Deconvolution model. The experiments were made in a Intel\u00ae CoreTM\n\ni7 3.70 GHz.\n\n4.5.2.2 Experiment for Ro = 0.0002\n\nNow we present the results obtained for the double gyre experiment\n\nconsidering Ro = 0.0002 and\n(\n?M\nL\n\n)3\n= 0.01. Figures 4.4(a) and 4.5(a) present the\n\nstreamfunction and vorticity solutions obtained in the high resolution mesh (50\u00d7100\n\nmesh). We observe that in this experiment, the solution presents a distinct six gyre\n\npattern. Futhermore, as we can see in Figure 4.4(b), this pattern is also susceptible\n\nto the mesh resolution. That is, when we simulate this experiment using the BV\n\nmodel in a coarse 8 \u00d7 16 mesh the six gyre pattern degenerates into two gyres.\n\nMoreover, the vorticity field produced in the coarse mesh becomes noisy.\n\nUsing the BV-? (? = 1\n8\n) model we recover the four gyre pattern (Figure\n\n4.4(c)), but not the six gyre pattern observed in the high resolution solution and, as\n\n97\n\n\n\nfor Ro = 0.0016, it is intensified compared to the high resolution solution. On the\n\nother hand, the streamfunction solutions produced with the BV-?-Deconvolution\n\nmodel for N ? 1 are less intensified (Figures 4.4(d), 4.4(e) and 4.4(f)). Moreover,\n\nfor N = 3 the BV-?-deconvolution model recovers the six gyre pattern (Figure\n\n4.4(f)). In the vorticity field (Figures 4.5(d), 4.5(e) and 4.5(f)) we observe that,\n\nincreasing the deconvolution order, the solution becomes less noisy and more similar\n\nto the high resolution solution. Computational times for the BV model in the fine\n\n(50\u00d7100) and coarse mesh (8\u00d716) and for BV-?-Deconvolution in the coarse mesh\n\n(8\u00d716) are presented in Table 4.5. We see that, although the computational time is\n\nincreased by increasing the deconvolution order in the BV-?-Deconvolution model,\n\nit is significant faster than solving the BV model in the fine mesh.\n\nAgain, the results presented in this experiment corroborate the conver-\n\ngence analysis presented herein: increasing the deconvolution order makes solutions\n\nmore accurate.\n\nFine Coarse alpha (D0) BV-?-D1 BV-?-D2 BV-?-D3\n9.82e5 8.22e3 3.31e4 4.92e3 9.06e4 1.57e5\n\nTable 4.5: Run times (in seconds) obtained for Ro = 0.0016 in the fine (50 \u00d7 100) and\ncoarse (4 \u00d7 8) mesh with the BV model and in the coarse mesh (4 \u00d7 8) with\nBV-?-Deconvolution model. The experiments were made in a Intel\u00ae CoreTM\n\ni7 3.70 GHz.\n\n4.6 Conclusion and final remarks\n\nWe have proposed and analysed an FEM scheme for the BV-?-Deconvolution\n\nmodel of geophysical flows that regularizes the flow and improves accuracy compared\n\nto the BV-? model. We proved that the scheme is both unconditionally stable and\n\noptimally convergent. Furthermore, we confirmed the predicted convergence rates\n\nthrough numerical simulations. Finally, we tested the BV-?-Deconvolution model\n\nin the traditional double gyre wind experiment, which is a more realistic model of\n\n98\n\n\n\nthe ocean dynamics, and found very good results. In this test we corroborate that\n\nincreasing the deconvolution order in the model produces a more accurate solution.\n\nIn the present article we tested the BV-?-Deconvolution in a situation\n\nin which only the barotropic mode of ocean dynamics is present. As in [99], in\n\na future work we intend to extend the BV-?-Deconvolution model for two layers\n\nin order apply this regularization to a more baroclinic situation. That will be an\n\nimportant step in the direction of true ocean dynamics.\n\n99\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(a) Str. func. - 64x128\n?min = ?1.39,?max = 1.39\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(b) Str. func. - 4x8\n?min = ?1.40,?max = 1.46\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(c) Str. func. - 4x8 - ?\n?min = ?2.58,?max = 2.56\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(d) Str. func. - 4x8 - D1\n?min = ?1.59,?max = 1.63\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(e) Str. func. - 4x8 - D2\n?min = ?1.48,?max = 1.43\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(f) Str. func. - 4x8 - D3\n?min = ?1.60,?max = 1.52\n\nFigure 4.2: Streamfunction fields in the experiment with ?M/L = 0.02 and Ro =\n0.0016 for (a) the high resolution BV model solution, (b) coarse (4 \u00d7 8)\nBV model solution and coarse (4 \u00d7 8) (c) BV-?, (d) BV-?-D1, (e) BV-\n?-D2 and (f) BV-?-D3.\n\n100\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(a) Vort. - 64x128\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(b) Vort. - 4x8\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(c) Vort. - 4x8 - ?\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(d) Vort. - 4x8 - D1\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(e) Vort. - 4x8 - D2\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(f) Vort. - 4x8 - D3\n\nFigure 4.3: Vorticity fields in the experiment with ?M/L = 0.02 and Ro = 0.0016 for\n(a) the high resolution BV model solution, (b) coarse (4\u00d78) BV model\nsolution and coarse (4 \u00d7 8) (c) BV-?, (d) BV-?-D1, (e) BV-?-D2 and\n(f) BV-?-D3.\n\n101\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(a) Str. func. - 50x100\n?min = ?1.51,?max = 1.50\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(b) Str. func. - 8x16\n?min = ?1.22,?max = 1.41\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(c) Str. func.- 8x16 - ?\n?min = ?1.34,?max = 1.34\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(d) Str. func.- 8x16 - D1\n?min = ?1.25,?max = 1.30\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(e) Str. func.- 8x16 - D2\n?min = ?1.31,?max = 1.42\n\n \n\n \n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(f) Str. func.- 8x16 - D3\n?min = ?1.37,?max = 1.37\n\nFigure 4.4: Streamfunction fields in the experiment with ?M/L = 0.01 and Ro =\n0.0002 for (a) the high resolution BV model solution, (b) coarse (4 \u00d7 8)\nBV model solution and coarse (4 \u00d7 8) (c) BV-?, (d) BV-?-D1, (e) BV-\n?-D2 and (f) BV-?-D3.\n\n102\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(a) Vort. - 50x100\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(b) Vort. - 8x16\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(c) Vort. - 8x16 - ?\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(d) Vort. - 8x16 - D1\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(e) Vort. - 8x16 - D2\n\n \n\n \n\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(f) Vort. - 8x16 - D3\n\nFigure 4.5: Vorticity fields in the experiment with ?M/L = 0.01 and Ro = 0.0002 for\n(a) the high resolution BV model solution, (b) coarse (8x16) BV model\nsolution and coarse (8x16) (c) BV-?, (d) BV-?-D1, (e) BV-?-D2 and (f)\nBV-?-D3.\n\n103\n\n\n\n5 REGULARIZED BOUSSINESQ MODEL1\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nDensity currents are one of the most important kind of geophysical flow.\n\nThey can be defined as flows forced by the buoyant force due to density gradients in\n\nthe fluid. In atmosphere, important examples are the large scale Hadley and Walker\n\ncells in the general atmospheric circulation and the small scale thunderstorms and\n\nseabreeze. In the ocean, examples are the large scale Global Conveyor Belt resulting\n\nfrom the thermohaline circulation and the small/meso scale upwelling/downwelling\n\nmechanism as well as seafloor turbidity currents. Moreover, density currents are\n\nalso quite important in engineering applications.\n\nDespite of the relevance of density currents, they very often cannot be\n\nfully represented in simulations because several geophysical models adopt the hy-\n\ndrostatic approximation. Only recently, studies using non-hydrostatic models have\n\nbeen performed. In [84] a density current was simulated in a model in the vorticity-\n\nstreamfunction variables. In [90], results produced by a non-hydrostatic model were\n\ncompared with density current data from the Red Sea. Also, threedimensional\n\nsimulations were performed in [86]. More recently, other aspects involving density\n\ncurrent modeling has been investigated in non-hydrostatic models, e. g., the effect of\n\ngeneralized coordinates [43], topography [85, 48], vertical mixing [16, 50], boundary\n\nconditions [7] and domain geometry [13, 49].\n\n1We are very grateful to Professor Leo G. Rebholz for his thoughts and advices on the results\npresented in this chapter.\n\n104\n\n\n\nOne of the most commonly used models to represent density currents\n\nis the Boussinesq model given by\n\n?u\n\n?t\n?u\u00d7?\u00d7u?Re?1?u + ?p?RiTk? = f, (5.1a)\n\n?\u00b7u = 0, (5.1b)\n?T\n\n?t\n+ u \u00b7?T ? (RePr)?1?T = 0. (5.1c)\n\nwhere u is velocity, p is pressure, T is temperature, f is a given force and Re, Ri\n\nand Pr are the Reynolds, Richardson and Prantdl number, respectively.\n\nSimulations using non-hydrostatic models, such as those for density cur-\n\nrent, demand a large computational cost and are restrict only to modest complexity\n\nflows, i.e., low Reynolds numbers. Thus, several studies have been done aimed\n\nat providing methods in order to reduce the computational cost when simulating\n\nthis kind of flow. Some methods already studied were mixing parametrization [16],\n\nlarge-eddy simulation (LES) [89, 87, 88, 49, 6], adaptive meshing [46] and Proper\n\nOrthogonal Decomposition reduced order modeling [70, 98].\n\nIn this chapter, an alternative approach, called regularized modeling, is\n\nstudied aimed at reducing the computational cost in simulations with the Boussinesq\n\nmodel. The Navier-Stokes-? (NS-?) model is an example of regularization model\n\nwhich has interesting mathematical, physical and computational properties (see [76]\n\nand references therein). The most important property of NS-? probably is that it\n\nallows a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom in simulations. In the NS-?\n\nmodel, the nonlinearity is altered so that the flow at length scales that are smaller\n\nthan the alpha length scale are nonlinearly removed by motions at the larger scales.\n\nThus, the flow can be computationally solved with a significant decrease in the model\n\ndegrees of freedom in comparison to the original NS equations, and there is no need\n\nto introduce additional dissipative terms or increase the viscosity coefficient. The\n\nNS-? [65, 75], Leray-? [64, 9] and Modified-Leray-? [51] are also regularizations of\n\nthe Navier-Stokes equations which differ from the NS-? by a modification in the\n\nnonlinearity. They have been recently tested and enjoyed success in simulations.\n\n105\n\n\n\nNS-?, NS-?, Leray-? and Modified-Leray-? are respectively defined to be\n\nut ?u\u00d7 (?\u00d7u) + ?p???u = f,\n\nut ?u\u00d7 (?\u00d7u) + ?p???u = f,\n\nut ?u \u00b7?u + ?p???u = f,\n\nut ?u \u00b7?u + ?p???u = f,\n\nwhere ? is the viscosity, f is a forcing and u is the filtered velocity given by\n\nu := Fu := (??2? + I)?1u.\n\nIn light of the above, the objective of this chapter is to study regularized\n\nversions of the Boussinesq model, namely, Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-\n\nLeray and Modified-Boussinesq-Leray, through numerical analysis and simulations.\n\nWe believe the advantage of regularization models over other approaches is because it\n\ncombine simpler implementation and smaller computational cost with sound math-\n\nematical and physical fundamentals.\n\nIn addition, we take the cumulative existing experience with ? models\n\nand use it in their Boussinesq variations. For instance, in wall bounded flows we\n\ncannot guarantee a non-divergent filtered velocity, hence a natural technique is to\n\nintroduce a Langrange multiplier in the filter equation in order to allow the physically\n\nimportant incompressibility contraint [76]. Moreover, in [63] it is shown that the\n\nvelocity error in the Navier-Stokes equations scales as velocity error ? Re\u00d7pressure\n\nerror and, if the mesh is not sufficiently fine, large pressure errors can produce large\n\nvelocity errors. This problem can be fixed using the modified grad-div stabilization\n\nproposed in [76], which is a modification of the grad-div technique used in [19] for the\n\nNavier-Stokes equations, but that avoids stability problems in regularized models.\n\nAnother important technique applied in alpha models to reduce computional cost is\n\nthe Baker extrapolation in the nonlinear term. This technique consists in linearly\n\nor quadratically extrapolating one of the velocities in the nonlinear term in order to\n\nlinearize the equations, avoiding the fixed point iteration necessary when solving the\n\n106\n\n\n\nnonlinear system. In a recent study, [52] shows that, with a small modification in the\n\nBaker extrapolation, interesting advantages can be gained both from the analytical\n\nand computational viewpoint. Lastly, from the filter equation it is clearly possible\n\nto see that for any alpha model we cannot expect accuracy better than O(?2) from\n\nthe model itself, even before any computational error is introduced. In [93, 94]\n\na fix is proposed based in the van Cittert method of approximate deconvolution,\n\nwhich increase the consistency error in the Navier-Stokes-? model from O(?2) to\n\nO(?2N+2) where N is the order of deconvolution operator. Besides, in [63, 94, 76, 9]\n\nit is shown that approximate deconvolution also improves solution even in situations\n\nin which the model error is not dominated by the consistency error. In this chapter,\n\nthe regularized versions of the Boussinesq model, along with the above mentioned\n\ntechniques, are mathematically analysed and computationally tested with respect\n\nto their ability to provide accurate solutions to density currents.\n\nThe chapter is outlined as follows: Section 5.2 presents notation and\n\nsome preliminary results. In Section 5.3 an algorithm for a general regularized\n\nBoussinesq model is proposed and studied with respect to its stability and conver-\n\ngence. Numerical experiments are presented in Section 5.4. Lastly, conclusions and\n\nfinal remarks are summarized in Section 5.5.\n\n5.2 The finite element scheme and preliminaries\n\nLet ? ?

The first and second estimates are well-known and follow from Ho?lder and\n\nLadyzhenskaya inequalities (see [60]). The third also follows from Ho?lder and La-\n\ndyzhenskaya inequality and the Sobolev embedding Theorem, where we also made\n\nuse of ??\u00d7 u? ? ??u? for u ? H10 . The fourth follows from Ho?lder with p = 2,\nq = 3 and r = 6, interpolation inequality for Lp spaces and Ladyzhenkaya inequality.\n\nFor the fifth, we made use of [a\u00d7 b] \u00b7 c = [c\u00d7 b] \u00b7a and that the curl is self-adjoint\nin X, i.e,\n\n|?(?\u00d7u) \u00d7v,w?| = |?w \u00d7v,?\u00d7u?| = |??\u00d7 (w \u00d7v),u?|\n\n? |?v \u00b7?w,u?| + |?w \u00b7?v,u?| + |?(?\u00b7v)w,u?| + |?(?\u00b7w)v,u?|\n\nwhere we used the identity ?\u00d7(a\u00d7b) = a\u00b7?b?b\u00b7?a+ (?\u00b7a)b+ (?\u00b7b)a. The result\n\nfollows after applying Ho?lder with p = 2, q = 3 and r = 6, interpolation inequality\n\nfor Lp spaces and Ladyzhenkaya inequality. The last two identities follow from the\n\nprevious, defining ?1(?) := max{B1(?),A1(?)} and ?2(?) := max{B2(?),A3(?)}.\n\nAlso, Taylor expansion with integral remainder gives [60]:\n\nLemma 5.2.

L2(?) and parameters ?,?,Re > 0, discrete\nfiltering Fh : L\n\n2(?) ? Xh is defined as the unique solution Fhw = wh ? Xh and\n?h ? Qh, such that ?{vh,qh}? Xh \u00d7Qh,\n\n?2\n(\n??wh,?vh? + ?Re??\u00b7wh,?\u00b7vh?\n\n)\n???h,?\u00b7vh? + ?qh,?\u00b7wh? + ?wh,vh? = ?w,vh?.\n\nGiven w ? X and parameters ?,Re > 0, the modified discrete Laplacian\n\noperator ??h : X ? Vh (see [76]) is the unique solution ??hw such that:\n\n???hw,vh? = ???w,?vh???Re??\u00b7w,?\u00b7vh?, ?vh ? Vh.\n\nThus, Fh : L\n2(?) ? Vh can be defined equivalently as wh ? Vh such\n\nthat\n\n??2???hwh,vh? + ?wh,vh? = ?w,vh? ?vh ? Vh. (5.3)\n\nThe following equalities involving Fh and ??h hold:\n\nLemma 5.3.\n\n???huh,vh? = ?uh, ??hvh? ?uh,vh ? Xh,\n\n?Fhu,v? = ?u,Fhv? ?u,v ? X,\n\n??hFhuh = Fh??huh ?uh ? Vh,\n\nFhPhu = Fhu ?u ? X.\n\nThat is, ??h is self-adjoint and commutes with Fh in Xh and Fh is self-adjoint in X.\n\nProof. For the first, given uh,vh ? Xh and using the definition of ??h we have\n\n???huh,vh? = ???uh,?vh???Re??\u00b7uh,?\u00b7vh? = ?uh, ??hvh?.\n\n110\n\n\n\nFor the second, given u,v ? X, using the filter equation, Fhu ? Vh satisfies\n\n?2??Fhu,?Fhv? + ?2?Re??\u00b7Fhu,?\u00b7Fhv? + ?Fhu,Fhv? = ?u,Fhv?, (5.4)\n\nwhere we chose vh = Fhv ? Vh.\n\nOn the other hand, using again the filter equation, Fhv ? Vh satisfies\n\n?2??Fhv,?Fhu? + ?2?Re??\u00b7Fhv,?\u00b7Fhu? + ?Fhv,Fhu? = ?v,Fhu?, (5.5)\n\nwhere, in the above equation, we chose vh = Fhu ? Vh. Now, subtracting (5.4) from\n\n(5.5) gives the result.\n\nFor the third, the filter equation gives\n\n??2???hFhuh,vh? + ?Fhuh,vh? = ?uh,vh? ?uh,vh ? Vh.\n\nBecause Fh and ??h are self-adjoint in Vh, the filter equation gives\n\n??2?Fh??huh,vh? + ?Fhuh,vh? = ?uh,vh? uh,vh ? Vh.\n\nwhere we also use that uh,vh ? Vh are arbitrary. Subtracting both equations gives\n\n??2?(??hFh ?Fh??h)uh,vh? = 0,\n\nwhich gives the result, after we choose vh = (??hFh ?Fh??h)uh.\n\nFinally, for the last one, given u ? X, we consider respectively filtering\n\nu and Phu, ?vh ? Vh,\n\n?2 (??Fhu,?vh? + ?Re??\u00b7Fhu,?\u00b7vh?) + ?Fhu,vh? = ?u,vh?,\n\n?2 (??FhPhu,?vh? + ?Re??\u00b7FhPhu,?\u00b7vh?) + ?FhPhu,vh? = ?Phu,vh? = ?u,vh?.\n\nwhich gives the result, after we subtract them and choose vh = (FhPh ?Fh)u.\n\nIn addition, the following bounds hold for filtered quantities:\n\n111\n\n\n\nLemma 5.4. For u ? X, the following inequalities hold:\n\n?uh???u?, (5.6a)\n\n??uh?? c(?)??u?, (5.6b)\n\n?(I ?Fh)u???u?, (5.6c)\n\n?Fhu,u?? 0, (5.6d)\n\n?(I ?Fh)u,u?? 0. (5.6e)\n\nIn particular, for u ? Xh,\n\n???hu,u?? 0. (5.6f)\n\nProof. The first follows choosing vh = u\nh in (5.3) and using Cauchy-Schwarz in-\n\nequality. For the second, we choose vh = ?hu\nh in (5.3) to obtain\n\n?2???huh?2 + ??uh?2 + ?Re??\u00b7uh?2 = ??u, ?huh? = ??Phu, ?huh?\n\n= ??Phu,?uh? + ?Re??\u00b7Phu,?\u00b7uh?.\n\nThe result follows using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For the third inequality, using\n\n?(I ?Fh)u?2 = ?(I ?Fh)u, (I ?Fh)u? = ?u?2 ? 2?u,uh? + ?uh?2.\n\nNow, choosing vh = u\nh in (5.3) and substituting in the above formula, we have\n\n?(I ?Fh)u?2 = ?u?2 ??uh?2 ? 2?2??uh?2 ? 2?2?Re??\u00b7uh?2,\n\nfrom which the result follows. For the fourth inequality, we have only to choose\n\nvh = Fhu in the filter equation (5.3). For the fifth, first note that using Cauchy-\n\nSchwarz inequality and the first inequality we have ??Fhu,u????u?2. Then,\n\n?(I ?Fh)u,u? = ?u?2 ??Fhu,u?,\n\ngives the result. The sixth inequality follows directly from the ??h definition.\n\nGiven u ? X, the van Cittert deconvolution operator DhN is defined by\n\nDhNu =\nN?\ni=0\n\n(I ?Fh)\ni\nu (5.7)\n\n112\n\n\n\nLemma 5.5. The operator DhN is continuous and the following formulae hold\n\nN?\ni=0\n\n(I ?Fh)\ni\nFh = I ? (I ?Fh)\n\nN+1\n,\n\n(I ?Fh)i = (?1)i?2i(??hFh)i,\n\nDhNFh = I ? (I ?Fh)\nN+1,\n\nDhNFh = I ? (?1)\nN+1?2N+2(??hFh)\n\nN+1.\n\nProof. That operator DhN is continuous follows from the continuity of Fh. For the\n\nfirst formula we use the algebraic identity BN+1 ?I = (B?I)(BN + BN?1 + ... + I)\n\nwith B = I?Fh. For the second, using the filter equation (5.3), ??2??hFh = I?Fh\ngives the result. Finally, for the third, we use the definition of DhN and the first\n\nformula. For the last one, we combine the second and third formulae.\n\nLemma 5.6. Given u ? X, we have the following formulae\n\n?Phu,DhNuh? = ?D\nh\nNu\n\nh?2 + ?2??(I ?Fh)\nN+n\n\n2 uh?2 + ?2?Re??\u00b7 (I ?Fh)\nN+n\n\n2 uh?2,\n\n????hPhu,DhNu\nh? = ??DhNu\n\nh?2 + ?2?Re??\u00b7DhNu\nh?2 + ?2???h(I ?Fh)\n\nN+n\n2 uh?2.\n\nProof. Using the third formula in Lemma 5.5, u = DhNu\nh + (I ?Fh)N+1u. Then\n\n?Phu,DhNu\nh? = ?u,DhNu\n\nh? = ?DhNu\nh?2 + ?(I ?Fh)N+1u,DhNu\n\nh?\n\n= ?DhNu\nh?2 +\n\nN?\ni=0\n\n?(I ?Fh)N+1u, (I ?Fh)iuh?\n\n= ?DhNu\nh?2 +\n\nN?\ni=0\n\n?(I ?Fh)(I ?Fh)\nN+i\n\n2 u, (I ?Fh)\nN+i\n\n2 uh?\n\nwhere we have used that Fh and (I ?Fh) are positive (Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4).\n\nNow rewriting filter equation as ?2??Fhw,?vh? + ?2?Re?? \u00b7Fhw,?\u00b7\nvh? = ?w ?Fhw,vh? ?vh ? Vh and using w = (I ?Fh)\n\nN+i\n2 u and vh = (I ?Fh)\n\nN+i\n2 uh\n\n?2??(I ?Fh)\nN+i\n2 uh?2 + ?2?Re??\u00b7 (I ?Fh)\n\nN+i\n2 uh?2 = ?(I ?Fh)(I ?Fh)\n\nN+i\n2 u, (I ?Fh)\n\nN+i\n2 uh?\n\nwhich gives the first formula.\n\n113\n\n\n\nFor the second, we use again u = DhNu\nh + (I ?Fh)N+1u to obtain\n\n????hPhu,DhNu\nh? = ??DhNu\n\nh?2 + ?Re??\u00b7DhNu\nh?2 ????hPh(I ?Fh)N+1u,DhNu\n\nh?\n\nNow, using the filter equation ??2???hFhw,vh? = ?w ?Fhw,vh? ?vh ?\n\nVh with w = (I ?Fh)Nu and vh = ??hDhNu\nh\n\n????hPhu,DhNu\nh? = ??DhNu\n\nh?2 + ?Re??\u00b7DhNu\nh?2 + ?2???h(I ?Fh)Nuh, ??hDhNu\n\nh?\n\n= ??DhNu\nh?2 + ?Re??\u00b7DhNu\n\nh?2 + ?2\nN?\ni=0\n\n?(I ?Fh)N ??huh, (I ?Fh)i??huh?\n\nwhich gives the result.\n\nNow, following [79, 76] and using Lemma 5.6, we define the energy\n\n? \u00b7?E,N and the energy dissipation ? \u00b7??,N norms as\n\n?u?E,N := ?Phu,DhNu\nh?1/2 (5.8)\n\n?u??,N := ????hPhu,DhNu\nh?1/2 (5.9)\n\nThe following equivalence norm Lemmas which are presented in [79]\n\nand [76] are very helpful in the subsequent analysis.\n\nLemma 5.7.

Applying the filter equation (5.3) for DhNu and choosing vh = Phu\n\n??2???hFhDhNu,Phu? + ?FhD\nh\nNu,Phu? = ?D\n\nh\nNu,Phu?\n\nNow using Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4 we have\n\n??2?DhNFhu, ??hPhu? + ?FhD\nh\nNu,Phu? =\n\nN?\ni=0\n\n?(I ?Fh)iu,Phu??\nN?\ni=0\n\n?Phu??u?\n\nfrom which the result follows.\n\n115\n\n\n\nFor the second, applying the filter equation for DhNPhu, choosing vh = ??hPhu\n\nand using the modified discrete Laplacian definition, we obtain\n\n??2\nN?\ni=0\n\n?(I ?Fh)iFh??hPhu, ??hPhu? + ?DhNFhPhu, ??hPhu? = ??D\nh\nNPhu,???hPhu?.\n\nNow, using that Fh, I ?

In the first we estimate convergence rates using an analytical solution based\n\non the Taylor-Green solution for Navier-Stokes equations. In the second, the reg-\n\n129\n\n\n\nularized models were evaluated in traditional the Marsigli\u2019s flow benchmark. Both\n\nexperiments were made with the FreeFem++ software [40] using a multi-frontal\n\nGauss LU factorization implemented in the package UMFPACK (provided with\n\nFreeFem++ software).\n\n5.4.1 Convergence rates\n\nIn order to evaluate the computational implementation of the above\n\nmentioned algorithm and validate its convergence theory, in this section we estimate\n\nconvergence rates for four regularized versions of the Boussinesq model. To perform\n\nthis analysis, we adapt the traditional Taylor-Green solution used for Navier-Stokes\n\nequations as a means to construct a solution of the Boussinesq model. Considering\n\nthe forcing f =\n(\n\n0,?Ri exp\n[\n? 2m\n\n2?2t\nRe\n\n]\ncos(N?x) cos(m?y)\n\n)\nand the square domain\n\n[0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] we obtain the following solution of Boussinesq model:\n\np = ?1\n4\n\nexp\n[\n?2m\n\n2?2t\nRe\n\n]\n[cos(2m?x) + cos(2m?y)]\n\nu1 = ?exp\n[\n?2m\n\n2?2t\nRe\n\n]\ncos(m?x) sin(m?y)\n\nu2 = exp\n[\n?2m\n\n2?2t\nRe\n\n]\nsin(m?x) cos(m?y)\n\nT = exp\n[\n?2m\n\n2?2t\nRe\n\n]\ncos(m?x) cos(m?y).\n\nIn this experiment we considered the temporal interval [0, 2], Taylor-\n\nHood and P2/P3/P3 elements and m = 1. We also considered regular meshes for\n\nh = 1\n8\n, h = 1\n\n16\n, h = 1\n\n32\nand h = 1\n\n64\nand ? = h. Then we carefully chose the\n\ntimestep ?t in order to balance error sources from the convergence theorem. In\n\nTables 5.2 - 5.9 we present convergence rates estimated for several regularized\n\nBoussinesq model (Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-Leray, Boussinesq-? and Modified-\n\nBoussinesq-Leray Models).\n\nExamining the above mentioned tables, we observe that estimated con-\n\nvergence rates agree well with the convergence theory presented in the previous\n\nsection.

In addition, P2 elements for velocity and temperature and P1\n\nelements for pressure were employed in these simulations. In order to evaluate the\n\nregularized versions of the Boussinesq model, solutions obtained in a coarse mesh\n\nwith the regularized and the original Boussinesq model (with and without artificial\n\nviscosity) are compared with a high resolution solution.

In this test we adopted regular trian-\n\ngular elements with h = 0.034, which corresponds to a grid with 240 \u00d7 30 squares.\n\nThe obtained results are presented in Figures 5.1(b), 5.2(b), 5.3(b) and 5.4(b). We\n\nsee that at t = 2 solution is very noisy and in the subsequent instants it degenerates.\n\nAfter that, we test the commonly used technique of artificial viscosity in\n\nwhich the viscosity is artificially increased in order to stabilize the model. Solution\n\nobtained for Re = 1000 is presented in Figures 5.1(c), 5.2(c) and 5.3(c) and 5.4(c)\n\nand for Re = 1500 in Figures 5.1(d), 5.2(d), 5.3(d) and 5.4(d). For the case in which\n\nRe = 1000 we observe that the consistency error is large causing the solution to be\n\nsmoother when compared to the fine solution. On the other hand, when Re = 1500\n\nsolution gradually becomes noisy and in the final instant t = 8 it degenerates.\n\nFinally, we present the results obtained with regularized Boussinesq\n\nmodels using ? = h.

(D0, D1 and D2, respectively). In these figures we can see that\n\nBoussinesq-? and Boussinesq-Leray solutions are accurate and very similar to the\n\nhigh resolution solution. On the other hand, Boussinesq-? and Modified-Boussinesq-\n\nLeray, despite being stable, produced very smoothed solutions in comparison with\n\nthe fine solution. Moreover, at t = 8 only small discrepancies between Boussinesq-\n\n?-D1 and Boussinesq-Leray-D2 can be observed. The main difference is the central\n\nvortice which is better represented in the Boussinesq-Leray-D2 solution. The L\n2\n\nerror estimated using the fine solution as reference is presented in Table 5.10. In\n\nthis table we also see that Boussinesq-Leray and Boussinesq-alpha produced the\n\nbest approximations.\n\nIn Table 5.11 we also present the computional time for each model in\n\nthis experiment.

In these figures we can see that solution quickly degenerates using\n\nthe Boussinesq model without regularization.\n\nAlso, we evaluate the Boussinesq model solution obtained in the coarse\n\nmesh when viscosity is increased in order to stabilize the model (artificial viscosity\n\ntechnique). In Figures 5.5(c), 5.6(c), 5.7(c) and 5.8(c) we present solutions produced\n\nusing Re = 1000 and in Figures 5.5(d), 5.6(d), 5.7(d) and 5.8(d) using Re = 1500.\n\nIn these figures we see that the solution becomes quite smoothed in both Re = 1000\n\nand Re = 1500 cases due to the consistency error caused by increasing the viscosity\n\ncoefficient.\n\nFinally, we present the solutions obtained in the coarse mesh with regu-\n\nlarized versions of the Boussinesq model. In this experiment we also adopted ? = h.\n\nResults for t = 2 are presented in Figure 5.5. In this instant we observe that\n\nsolutions are generally good, except in the case of the Boussinesq-? and Modified-\n\n139\n\n\n\nBoussinesq-Leray without deconvolution. However, solutions produced by the de-\n\nconvolved versions of these models are also accurate at t = 2. At t = 4 (Figure 5.6)\n\nsolutions provided by the regularized versions of Boussinesq model start to present\n\nsignificant differences between them. Although all deconvolved solutions are stable,\n\nwe observe that the Boussinesq-?-D1 and Boussinesq-Leray-D2 were more similar\n\nto the high resolution solution at t = 4s. Moreover, we observe that in general\n\nall regularized models are improved when the deconvolution order is increased. A\n\nsimilar pattern is still observed in t = 6 (Figure 5.7). Nevertheless, the Boussinesq-\n\n?-D1 solution lost its symmetry. Lastly, for t = 8 we observe that all deconvolved\n\nregularizations presented some degree of accuracy when compared to the high reso-\n\nlution solution. But, Boussinesq-Leray-D2 clearly provides the best solution among\n\nthe regularized models. The L2 error estimated using the fine solution as refer-\n\nence for this experiment is presented in Table 5.12. In this table we see again that\n\nthe Boussinesq-Leray produced the best approximations. It is important to remark\n\nthat, clearly from Algorithm 5.1, the Boussinesq-Leray (as well as the Boussinesq-\n\n?) also has strong computational advantages when compared to Boussinesq-? and\n\nModified-Boussinesq-Leray models, due to the decoupling between the momentum\n\nand the filter equation, which reduces the computational cost and enables it to work\n\nwith any deconvolution order without a significant increase in computational time.\n\n?Tcoarse\nh\n\n?Tfine\nh\n?22,0\n\nBoussinesq 8.3356\nBoussinesq+Art.

As discussed in Chapter 1, geophysical flows are immensely\n\nimportant because of their plethora of applications in the atmospheric and oceanic\n\nsciences. Despite being one of the first applications of scientific computation and the\n\ngreat development of the computer power, realistic geophysical flow simulations are\n\nfar from being fully resolved, largely due to the huge computational cost that would\n\nbe necessary to reproduce all the necessary scales, but also because turbulence in this\n\nkind of flow is not totally understood. Thus, meteorologists and oceanographers very\n\noften have to resort to additional techniques in order to overcome these problems.\n\nInterestingly, despite the great importance of techniques to deal with turbulence\n\nin geophysical flows simulations, they are mainly projected and analysed in the\n\nengineering applications context. The main objective of this thesis is to apply and\n\nanalyse these techniques, particularly the regularization models, in the geophysical\n\nframework. Our interest in regularization models is due to its sound mathematical\n\nand physical foundations and its ease to implement and low computational cost.\n\nMoreover, we are also motivated by some recent studies involving the application of\n\nalpha regularizations in the geophysical context which demonstrated some success\n\nin this kind of application.\n\nFollowing the classical division adopted in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics\n\nin terms of barotropic and baroclinic flows, this thesis was divided into two parts\n\nin which regularizations technique was applied in the Barotropic Vorticity model in\n\nthe first part and in the Boussinesq model for density currents in the second one.\n\nIn the first part, we started in Chapter 2 with the BV-Tikhonov model,\n\nwhich is a regularization of the Barotropic Vorticity model based on the Navier-\n\nStokes-? model with the modified Tikhonov-Lavrentiev deconvolution. Then, we\n\nproposed a Crank-Nicolson algorithm for BV-Tikhonov model and showed it is stable\n\n145\n\n\n\nand optimally convergent. Afterward, the BV-Tikhonov model was tested in the the\n\ntraditional double gyre wind forcing benchmark in which it could recover the high\n\nresolution pattern when computing on a coarse mesh. However, these experiments\n\nalso showed that the BV-Tikhonov solution can dramatically improve over the BV-?\n\nsolution (obtained when \u00b5 = 1 in the BV-Tikhonov model) by a careful choice of the\n\n\u00b5 parameter. That is, \u00b5 &lt;1 has to be chosen in order to improve the solution by\n\ncontrolling the model consistency error and avoiding filtering in the resolved scales,\n\nbut on the other hand it weakens the regularization.\n\nTwo natural improvements in the BV-Tikhonov model were 1) look for\n\na less sensible regularization to this kind of problem and 2) apply the van Cittert\n\napproximate deconvolution method in the BV model, which, in the case of Navier-\n\nStokes equations, is known to increase the model consistency error order. The former\n\nimprove was studied in Chapter 3 and the latter in Chapter 4.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we tested, to the best of our knowledge for the first time,\n\nthe Bardina regularization of the Barotropic Vorticity model, which was called BV-\n\nBardina model. The BV-Bardina model is a regularization of the BV model which\n\ndiffers from the BV-? by the presence of a filtered vorticity in the nonlinear term\n\nhaving, consequently, more regularization. We proposed a Crank-Nicolson finite\n\nelement scheme for BV-Bardina model and showed it is unconditionally stable and\n\noptimally convergent, which was also corroborated in numerical simulations. Finally,\n\nwe evaluated the BV-Bardina solution in the double wind forcing benchmark against\n\nthe artificial vorticity technique and the BV-? model, in which we show that the\n\nBV-Bardina model compares favourably to both.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we proposed and studied the BV-?-Deconvolution model.\n\nThe BV-?-Deconvolution model was inspired in the Navier-Stokes-?-Deconvolution\n\nmodel in which, through the approximate deconvolution technique, increase arbitrar-\n\nily the consistency error order in the model. Actually, the BV-?-Deconvolution is a\n\nfamily of models which generalizes the BV-? and improves accuracy. We studied a\n\n146\n\n\n\nCrank-Nicolson finite element scheme for BV-?-Deconvolution and prove its stability\n\nand optimal convergence. In particular, we showed that the BV-?-Deconvolution\n\nhas an O(?2N+2) consistency error, where N is the deconvolution order, whereas\n\nBV-? is only O(?2) accurate. In addition, we confirmed the convergence theory\n\nby estimating convergence rates through computational simulations. Finally, we\n\ndemonstrated that the BV-?-Deconvolution model can accurately retrieve the high\n\nresolution solution without weakening the filtering, as in the BV-Tikhonov model.\n\nInstead, dramatic improvement is obtained only increasing the deconvolution order.\n\nMoreover, we showed both that i) even when the convergence error is dominated by\n\nthe spatial error term, increasing deconvolution order still improve the model solu-\n\ntion and ii) higher-order BV-?-Deconvolution model can retrieve very challenging\n\nsolution structures which cannot be retrieved by decreasing the \u00b5 parameter in the\n\nBV-Tikhonov model.\n\nThe second part of this thesis was devoted to the baroclinic flows\n\nthrough the Boussinesq model. Then, based in the regularization theory for Navier-\n\nStokes equations, in Chapter 5 we proposed a family of regularizations for the Boussi-\n\nnesq model, namely Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-?, Boussinesq-Leray and Modified-\n\nBoussinesq-Leray models, all of them using the approximate deconvolution tech-\n\nnique. Initially, we propose and analyse a Crank-Nicolson finite element scheme for\n\na general regularized Boussinesq model which conserves energy and is uncondition-\n\nally stable and optimally convergent. Then, we showed through simulations that i)\n\nthe convergence theory is supported by all of them, ii) they all perform well in the\n\nMarsigli flow\u2019s experiment and iii) increasing the deconvolution order improves the\n\nsolution. However, in the more challenging situation in which the Reynolds num-\n\nber is large, we showed that the Boussinesq-Leray model was significantly better\n\nthan the other regularized models. Moreover, the Boussinesq-Leray, because of its\n\nmathematical structure, allows the decoupling between the filter equation and the\n\nmomentum equation enabling a much smaller computational cost regardless of the\n\ndeconvolution order.\n\n147\n\n\n\nThere are several directions in which this thesis can be extended, giving\n\nrise to future research. Firstly, in the case of BV model, there are some regular-\n\nizations that need to be tested such as Voigt [55, 56, 68] and omega [65], and\n\ntheir respective approximate deconvolved versions (Van Cittert [75] and Tikhonov-\n\nLavrentiev [105]). Another interesting recent approach is the iterated modified\n\nTikhonov-Lavrentiev approximate deconvolution [53], which allows control of the\n\nconvergence order and, in principle, can be applied in any regularization model.\n\nMoreover, another direction in which the studies with BV model can be extended is\n\nto consider the BV model for two layers. Recently, a LES version of the BV model\n\nbased on the Approximate Deconvolution Model (ADM), was studied considering\n\ntwo layers [99], after being studied for one layer [100]. Thus, the first baroclinic mode\n\ncan be considered in the model which would permit to evaluate the regularizations\n\nin a situation more similar with the true threedimensional ocean dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, a natural next step for the study of density currents\n\nusing the Boussinesq model is to extend the experiments for threedimensional situa-\n\ntions. An interesting benchmark test is the 3D lock-exchange problem [87] in which\n\nsome LES and parametrization models were recently tested [87, 88, 6, 16]. Also,\n\neven for 2D simulations, it would be very interesting to study Voigt and modified\n\nTikhonov-Lavrentiev regularizations for the Boussinesq model. In our experiments\n\nwith the Boussinesq model, we observed that small changes in the alpha param-\n\neter can significantly improve the solution, which is probably related to a better\n\nadjustment of the filter transfer function. The modified Tikhonok-Lavrentiev de-\n\nconvolution [105] permits control of the regularization transfer function, what would\n\nallow a better tuning of the regularized model, or even better with higher order con-\n\nsistency error such as in [53].\n\nAn interesting open problem regarding regularization models is related\n\nto the kind of filter used. The Helmholtz filter used in regularization models is a kind\n\nof differential filter introduced by Germano [30, 29], which has several advantages\n\n148\n\n\n\nfrom the implementation point of view. However, this filter has some drawbacks,\n\ne.g., 1) its transfer function never goes zero, what means that it does not completely\n\nremove the energy in subgrid wavenumbers; 2) it is too dissipative in the region close\n\nto grid cut-off wavenumber, meaning that it significantly affects the resolved scales.\n\nThus, meaningful improvement in solutions provided by regularization models can\n\nbe achieved by fixing this problem. An interesting approach is the nonlinear filtering\n\n[67, 8] which permits to filter locally the flow based in a given indicator function\n\navoiding regions where the flow is resolvable. In addition to the physical based\n\nindicator functions [67, 8], recently a mathematical based indicator function given by??uh?DhNuh?? [10] permits, as well to select filtered regions, to increase the consistency\nerror in the regularization model. Another interesting approach is to investigate\n\nand apply other filters with a sharper transfer function decay which save the low to\n\nmoderate scales and completely remove the subgrid scales (see [101, 83, 80]).\n\n149\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] Adams, N., and Stolz, S.
