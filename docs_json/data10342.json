The best-preserved volcano-\n\nsedimentary associations occur in the Camaqu\u00e3 and Campo Alegre Basins, respectively in the Sul-rio-\n\ngrandense and Catarinense Shields and are outside the main shear belts or overlying the unaffected base-\n\nment areas. These basins are characterized by alternation of volcanic cycles and siliciclastic sedimentation\n\ndeveloped dominantly on a continental setting under subaerial conditions. This volcanism and the coeval plu-\n\ntonism evolved from high-K tholeiitic and calc-alkaline to shoshonitic and ended with a silica-saturated sodic\n\nalkaline magmatism, and its evolution were developed during at least 60 Ma. The compositional variation\n\nand evolution of post-collisional magmatism in southern Brazil are interpreted as the result mainly of melting\n\nof a heterogeneous mantle source, which includes garnet-phlogopite-bearing peridotites, veined-peridotites\n\nwith abundant hydrated phases, such as amphibole, apatite and phlogopite, and eventually with the addition of\n\nan asthenospheric component. The subduction-related metasomatic character of post-collisional magmatism\n\nmantle sources in southern Brazil is put in evidence by Nb-negative anomalies and isotope features typical\n\nof EM1 sources.\n\nKey words: post-collisional, Neoproterozoic, volcanism, shoshonite, Na-alkaline.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Neoproterozoic in southernmost Brazil is char-\n\nacterized mainly by plutonism along large trans-\n\n*Member Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\nCorrespondence to: Carlos Augusto Sommer\nE-mail: casommer@sinos.net\n\nlithospheric shear belts and plutonism, volcanism\n\nand sedimentation in strike-slip basins, namely the\n\nCamaqu\u00e3, Campo Alegre, Castro and Itaja\u00ed basins.\n\nThese volcano-sedimentary associations are situa-\n\nted away from the main shear zones, lying on base-\n\nments of Brasiliano age (Castro and Itaja\u00ed Basins),\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n574 CARLOS A. SOMMER et al.\n\nPaleoproterozoic granulitic rocks of the Luiz Alves\n\nCraton (Campo Alegre Basin) and diverse older ig-\n\nneous and metamorphic terrains (Camaqu\u00e3 Basin)\n\n(Fig. 1). These basins are related to the post-col-\n\nlisional stages of the Brasiliano-Pan-African cycle\n\nand are considered as strike-slip basins, although\n\nthere are controversies on their classifications and\n\nmechanisms of generation (Almeida et al. 1981,\n\nBrito Neves and Cordani 1991, Chemale Jr. 2000,\n\nGresse et al. 1996, Paim et al. 2000). The concept\n\nof post-collisional setting assumed in this paper is\n\ntaken from Li\u00e9geois (1998) and Bonin (2004), as\n\nthe complex period which postdates the main col-\n\nlision and can include large movements along tran-\n\nscurrent shear belts, oblique collision, lithosphere\n\ndelamination, rifting, subduction of small tectonic\n\noceanic plates, and strike-slip basin volcanism and\n\nsedimentation.\n\nImportant volcanic cycles have been iden-\n\ntified mainly in the Camaqu\u00e3 and Campo Alegre\n\nBasins. In the former three distinct cycles have\n\nbeen identified (Wildner et al. 2002): (i) the older\n\nvolcanic rocks show shoshonitic affinity (Bom\n\nJardim Group, Hilario Formation), are dominantly\n\nof intermediate composition, with some basic and\n\nacidic occurrences; (ii) shoshonitic rocks are suc-\n\nceeded by a bimodal sodic mildly alkaline volcan-\n\nism (Cerro do Bugio Group, Acampamento Velho\n\nFormation), represented mainly by acidic effusive/\n\nexplosive episodes and a minor basic pole; (iii) the\n\nyoungest volcanic rocks (Guaritas Group, Rodeio\n\nVelho Member) are characterized by basic to inter-\n\nmediate lava-flow deposits of sodic mildly alkaline\n\nto high-K tholeiitic (Fig. 1a). In the Campo Alegre\n\nBasin the volcanic sequence is bimodal, sodic, alka-\n\nline and silica saturated, similar to that observed in\n\nthe Camaqu\u00e3 Basin (Fig. 1b).\n\nPetrographic, geochemical and geochronolog-\n\nical data of Neoproterozoic volcanism in some of\n\nthe post-collisional basins of southernmost Brazil\n\nare reviewed and discussed in this paper, in order\n\nto re-evaluate the evolution of post-collisional mag-\n\nmatism and its probable sources.\n\nTHE CAMAQU\u00c3 AND CAMPO ALEGRE BASINS\n\nThe Camaqu\u00e3 Basin shows an evolution charac-\n\nterized by the alternation of depositional intervals,\n\nwith accumulation of thick sedimentary and vol-\n\ncano sedimentary sequences and dominantly ero-\n\nsive intervals. During the filling phase volcanic\n\ndeposits were formed, alternated with siliciclastic\n\nsedimentation. The sedimentary sequence of the\n\nCamaqu\u00e3 Basin represents an evolution from shal-\n\nlow marine to lacustrine-alluvial and desertic set-\n\ntings in a typical continental environment (Paim et\n\nal. 2000). Important volcanic cycles were devel-\n\noped in this basin (Fig. 1a). Intermediate effusive\n\ndeposits, associated to volcaniclastic sequences and\n\nhypabissal bodies, constitute the Hilario Formation,\n\nwhich presents shoshonitic affinity, and most of it\n\nis included in the Lavras do Sul Shoshonitic Asso-\n\nciation (Lima and Nardi 1998). It is succeeded by\n\na bimodal volcanism \u2013 Acampamento Velho For-\n\nmation \u2013 of silica-saturated-sodic-alkaline affinity,\n\ndominated by an expressive acidic magmatism and\n\nrepresented mainly by effusive and pyroclastic flow\n\ndeposits (Sommer et al. 2005, Wildner et al. 2002,\n\nAlmeida et al. 2002). The youngest unit \u2013 Rodeio\n\nVelho Member \u2013 is constituted mainly by intermedi-\n\nate to basic lava flows, with transitional or tholeiitic\n\naffinity (Almeida et al. 1997).\n\nThe Campo Alegre Basin situated in the north-\n\neast portion of the Santa Catarina State (Fig. 1b),\n\npresents a non-deformed and non-metamorphosed\n\nvolcano-sedimentary sequence and a large amount\n\nof granitic intrusions. It lies on Archean granulite\n\nterrains and its formation is probably related to\n\ncrustal relaxation due to lithospheric thickening\n\nthat occurred during the Brasiliano cycle (Basei et\n\nal. 1992). The basin alternates deposition and ero-\n\nsive episodes in a shallow marine setting, where the\n\nsedimentary sequences were deposited and a sub-\n\naerial continental setting characterized mainly by\n\nvolcanic deposits. The volcanism in this basin is\n\nrepresented only by one volcanic cycle, the Campo\n\nAlegre Formation (Ebert 1971, Daitx and Carvalho\n\n1980), situated in the intermediate portion of the\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nNEOPROTEROZOIC POST-COLLISIONAL MAGMATISM IN SOUTH OF BRAZIL 575\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Localization and simplified geological maps of the Camaqu\u00e3 (a) and Campo Alegre (b) basins (modified from Wildner et\n\nal. 2002).\n\nbasin, and constituted by a bimodal volcanic se-\n\nquence (Waichel et al. 2000).\n\nTHE SHOSHONITIC VOLCANISM\n\nThe shoshonitic rocks represent the oldest mag-\n\nmatic unit in the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin, and includes vol-\n\ncanic and plutonic rocks, which are intercalated with\n\nvolcanogenic conglomerates and sandy to muddy\n\ndeposits related to turbidity flows, that are predom-\n\ninant in the top levels of this stratigraphic unit.\n\nThe effusive rocks are represented mostly by\n\npotassic trachybasalts and trachyandesites (shosho-\n\nnites) spatially and temporally associated with mon-\n\nzonitic to quartz-monzonitic and lamprophyric hy-\n\npabissal rocks, epizonal granitoids and cummulatic\n\nleucodiorites (Lima and Nardi 1998).\n\nBasic volcanic rocks are mostly in the lower\n\nstratigraphic levels, as lava flows or small shallow\n\nintrusions. They are porphyritic olivine (Fo66?68)\nbasalts with augite (Wo39?43; En44?49; Fs9?15),\nlabradorite to andesine, and ilmenite, in a matrix\n\nmade of andesine to oligoclase, apatite and modi-\n\nfied glass. Intermediate rocks are largely dominant\n\nin the volcanic sequence. They show porphyrytic\n\nand glomeroporphyrytic textures, abundant flow-\n\noriented labradorite-andesine phenocrysts, and mi-\n\nnor amounts of augite (Wo38?43 En 40?49 Fs 8?20),\nolivine (Fo62), Ti-magnetite and apatite, and a ma-\n\ntrix constituted by andesine-oligoclase crystallites\n\nand microlites along with glass.\n\nSubordinated subarerial pyroclastic fall and\n\nflow deposits are characterized as lapilli lithic to\n\ncrystal tuffs and crystal rich ignimbrites, with pla-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n576 CARLOS A. SOMMER et al.\n\ngioclase, K-feldspar and quartz, involved by ash\n\nmatrix. Volcaniclastic breccias are common and\n\noccur predominantly intercalated with trachyande-\n\nsitic flows and fall tuffs.\n\nSubvolcanic rocks are monzonites and quartz\n\nmonzonites and occur as small intrusions around\n\nthe Lavras Granite Complex. These rocks occur in\n\ntwo different facies: a porphyritic one with phe-\n\nnocrysts of plagioclase (oligoclase-andesine), K-\n\nfeldspar and amphibole (magnesium-hornblende),\n\njoined by biotite in more acidic members, and\n\nTi-magnetite involved by a feldspar-rich ground-\n\nmass, and an equigranular facies represented by\n\nmedium-grained rocks with a similar mineralogy.\n\nThese shallow intrusions are related to the latest\n\nmagmatic stages of the shoshonitic magmatism.\n\nCumulative leucodiorites occur as metric lenticular\n\nbodies involving the monzonitic rocks. They show\n\nequigranular texture, with strong flow orientation\n\nof plagioclase laths, besides clinopyroxene, mag-\n\nnetite and apatite as cumulus crystals, and small\n\namounts of intercumulus material, mostly actinolite\n\nand chlorite.\n\nLamprophyre dikes and a lava-dome of sho-\n\nshonitic affinity cut the volcanic sequence. Dykes\n\nare subvertical and generally 1 to 5 m wide, with\n\ntypical panidiomorphic and porphyrytic textures\n\ncharacterized by abundant amphibole phenocrysts\n\nsometimes associated with clinopyroxene, engulfed\n\nby a feldspathic groundmass constituted mainly by\n\nplagioclase. Based mainly on mineralogical and\n\ntextural evidence Lima and Nardi (1991) classified\n\nthem as spessartitic. Clinopyroxene compositions\n\nvary from diopside to augite, and amphibole compo-\n\nsitions vary from magnesiohastingsite to magnesio-\n\nhornblende. Plagioclase composition ranges from\n\nandesine to albite, with high Sr contents (2,000-\n\n3,000 ppm).\n\nPlutonic rocks include quartz monzodiorites,\n\nquartz monzonites, monzogranites, granodiorites\n\nand syenogranites, with diopside (Wo43 En40 Fs16),\n\naugite (Wo26 En50 Fs24) and magnesium hornblende\n\nin the less differentiated rocks evolving to ferro-\n\nedenite and biotite in the acidic terms. Apatite, zir-\n\ncon, allanite, titanite, magnetite and ilmenite are the\n\nmost frequent accessory phases. Hydrothermal ac-\n\ntivity is registered by secondary minerals, mainly\n\nchlorite, epidote, sericite, and calcite, and gold-cop-\n\nper-sulphide mineralization.\n\nTHE NA-ALKALINE BIMODAL VOLCANISM\n\nThe bimodal volcanism represents the extrusive\n\nportion of the voluminous sodic, silica-saturated,\n\nalkaline, granitic magmatism, mostly metalumi-\n\nnous with minor peralkaline components (Nardi\n\nand Bonin 1991). The volcanism occurred under\n\nsubaerial conditions and is exposed mainly in vol-\n\ncanic plateaus and ridges composed mostly of acidic\n\nlavas and pyroclastic deposits with minor interme-\n\ndiate and basic components (Sommer et al. 2005,\n\nWildner et al. 2002, Almeida et al. 2002). Erup-\n\ntive periods were generally initiated with explosive\n\nepisodes and closed by effusive events, which sug-\n\ngests a decrease in volatile activity through the\n\nprogress of volcanic eruption, representing a com-\n\nplete volcanic cycle.\n\nPyroclastic flows are the main volcaniclastic\n\ndeposits and are represented by ignimbrites of\n\ncomenditic affinity. The proximal and basal facies\n\nare characterized by co-ignimbritic breccias, con-\n\nstituted dominantly by juvenile, cognate and ac-\n\ncidental blocks and lapilli in a tuffaceous matrix.\n\nThis facies shows lateral gradational changes to\n\nignimbrites with abundant lithoclasts and pumice\n\nlapillis, besides K-feldspar and quartz phenoclasts,\n\nseparated in two main lithofacies: lenticulites and\n\ncrystal-rich deposits, both presenting K-feldspar\n\nand quartz phenoclasts, pumice fragments and\n\nscarce lithoclasts with lapilli-size, in an abundant\n\nvitroclastic tuffaceous matrix. The pyroclastic flow\n\ndeposits show evidences of hot, gas-supported em-\n\nplacement, such as welding, high-temperature de-\n\nvitrification processes (spherulites, axiolites), litho-\n\nphysae, perlitic fractures, gas-escape structures and\n\nvapor-phase crystals, which suggest the deposition\n\nfrom primary pyroclastic flows, generally restricted\n\nto subaerial settings.\n\nBasic-intermediate rocks are represented by\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nNEOPROTEROZOIC POST-COLLISIONAL MAGMATISM IN SOUTH OF BRAZIL 577\n\ndykes and lavas of hawaiitic and mugearitic com-\n\nposition. Dykes show a fine-grained phaneritic tex-\n\nture with plagioclase, clinopyroxene, ilmenite and\n\nrelicts of olivine, and lavas are porphyritic to glom-\n\neroporphyritic with plagioclase and pyroxene feno-\n\ncrysts in a matrix constituted by plagioclase and\n\npyroxene crystallites and microlites, and glass.\n\nLabradorite (An44?67) is the commonest compo-\nsition of plagioclase and clinopyroxene is augite\n\n(Wo39?43,En38?48, Fs12?20) in the dykes and diop-\nside (Wo48?49,En28?37, Fs14?23) in the lava flows.\n\nAcidic lava flows and syn-volcanic intrusions\n\nare represented mainly by comenditic rhyolites\n\nand minor trachytes erupted through fracture\n\nzones, where they exhibit a sub-vertical flow fo-\n\nliation, gradating laterally to auto-breccias, lavas\n\nwith sub-horizontal flow foliation and massive bod-\n\nies. Acidic rocks consist of alkali feldspar, usually\n\nmicroperthite, quartz, zircon, and iron oxides as ac-\n\ncessory phases. They generally show porphyritic\n\nto glomeroporphyritic textures, with low percent-\n\nages of phenocrysts set in a matrix constituted of a\n\nmosaic of quartz and feldspar microlites and crys-\n\ntallites. Mafic phases are scarce and occur as aci-\n\nculate crystals of amphibole and as rare pyroxene\n\nrelicts partially replaced by amphibole and chlorite.\n\nAmphibole in the acidic rocks presents the compo-\n\nsitions of sodic-calcic phase \u2013 ferro-winchite, ferro-\n\nbarroisite and ferro-richterite, and a calcic one \u2013\n\nferro-actinolite, which are frequently found in com-\n\nenditic rocks (Strong and Taylor 1984). The microp-\n\nerthitic alkalli feldspar has the composition Or84?98.\nHowever there are scarce homogeneous grains with\n\na composition close to sanidine (Or41?47). Plagio-\nclase has been transformed to albite (An0,5?3). Mi-\ncrophenocrysts of Ti-magnetite and ilmenite have\n\ncompositions similar to those described on peralka-\n\nline rhyolites (Sutherland 1975).\n\nGEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nTHE SHOSHONITIC MAGMATISM\n\nBasic-intermediate volcanic rocks plot in the tra-\n\nchybasalt and basaltic trachyandesite fields of the\n\nTAS diagram (Fig. 2a) and their potassic character\n\nis indicated by K2O values greater than Na2O-2 (Ta-\n\nble I), which classify them as potassic trachybasalts\n\nand shoshonites (Le Maitre 2002). They are gener-\n\nally silica saturated with normative olivine, hypers-\n\nthene and diopside. According to Lima and Nardi\n\n(1998) the Ni, Cr and Co contents in trachybasalts\n\nfrom LSSA are lower than those typical of primary\n\nmagmas.\n\nIn the sliding normalization diagram proposed\n\nby Li\u00e9geois et al. (1998), the rock association plot\n\nin the shoshonitic field, characterized by high SNY\n\n(=mean [Rb-U-Th-Ta]NYTS) values and low SNX\n\n(=mean [Zr-Ce-Sm-Y-Yb]NYTS) values (Fig 2b).\n\nIncompatible minor and trace elements show\n\nvery enriched LILE and LREE ocean island basalts\n\n(OIB) normalized patterns (Fig. 3a), which are char-\n\nacteristic of shoshonitic rocks. Nb is depleted rel-\n\native to LREE, which is considered as typical of\n\nmagmas produced from sources modified by a pre-\n\nvious subduction-related metasomatism (e.g. Kele-\n\nmen et al. 1993). Their low Nb/La and La/Ba ra-\n\ntios are comparable to those reported for orogenic\n\nandesites by Davies and Hawkesworth (1994). HFS\n\nelement contents are higher than in oceanic shoshon-\n\nites, and similar to those reported by Pearce (1983)\n\nfor those from continental margin. Y and Yb show\n\nlower contents than OIB (Fig. 3a), which may be\n\nascribed to the presence of garnet in the residuum\n\nof this magmatism or to equilibration of ascending-\n\nslab melts with garnet peridotites as suggested by\n\nKelemen et al. (1993). Ce/Sm and Sm/Yb ratios, as\n\nsuggested by Davies and Hawkesworth (1994), also\n\npoint out to the presence of garnet as a residual phase\n\nin the source of this magmatism. Chondrite normal-\n\nized REE patterns (Fig. 3b) are characterized by\n\nCeN values close to 100, YbN about 4 and absence\n\nof Eu anomalies; such features are also indicative\n\nof shoshonitic or high-potassium calc-alkaline mag-\n\nmas (Nardi and Lima 2000).\n\nIntermediate and acidic terms keep the same\n\npatterns of incompatible elements relative to OIB\n\n(Fig. 3a). The regularity of REE patterns (Fig. 3b)\n\nobserved for basic, intermediate and acidic rocks\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n578 CARLOS A. SOMMER et al.\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 (a) TAS (Le Bas et al. 1986) diagram plotting for shoshonitic and Na-alkaline rock samples; (b) Sliding normalization diagram\n\nfor shoshonitic and Na-alkaline rock samples (from Li\u00e9geois et al. 1998): circles: shoshonitic association; squares: Na-alkaline\n\nbimodal association; (c) SiO2 vs. TiO2and (d) SiO2 vs. P2O5 diagrams for Na-alkaline basic rocks.\n\nsuggests their cogeneticity and consequently the\n\norigin of acidic rocks through the differentiation of\n\nbasic and intermediate magmas.\n\nBecause several authors ascribe a significant\n\nrole to lower crust as the source or a significant con-\n\ntaminant to shoshonitic magmas, the LSSA rocks\n\nwere compared to the lower crust averages calcu-\n\nlated by Wedepohl (1995), in order to evaluate its\n\npetrogenetic involvement. The basic and intermedi-\n\nate terms show enriched patterns for most elements,\n\nparticularly for Ba, Sr and LREE, while Y and Yb\n\nare depleted relative to lower crustal values.

Rhy-\n\nolites of comenditic affinity are predominant in the\n\nvolcanic sequence. Basic rocks are mostly hawai-\n\nites and basalts, whilst mugearitic terms are scarce.\n\nThe sodic character is indicated by (Na2O \u2013 2) >\n\nK2O values, in spite of their high loss on ignition\n\n(LOI) values. Two evolutionary trends with con-\n\ntrasting Ti-P contents were identified and referred\n\nto as high- and low-Ti-P basalt-rhyolites (Sommer\n\net al. 2005) (Figs. 2c, 2d). A third compositional\n\ngroup probably represents the last magmatism in the\n\nCamaqu\u00e3 Basin, still related to the Brasiliano-Pan-\n\nAfrican post-collisional stage, which is referred to\n\nas high-Nb rhyolites (Figs. 2c, 2d, 4b).\n\nThe alkaline affinity of this bimodal associa-\n\ntion is observed in the sliding normalization scheme\n\nof Li\u00e9geois et al. 1998, where most rocks plot in\n\nthe field characterized by high SNX-SNY values\n\n(Fig. 2b).\n\nThe less differentiated rocks present relatively\n\nhigh FeOt/MgO ratios usually observed in tholei-\n\nitic series, which is corroborated by the behavior\n\nof some incompatible elements as Nb, Zr and Y, as\n\ndisplayed in Meschede\u2019s (1986) diagram (Fig. 4a),\n\nand by the Al2O3 contents, which are similar to\n\nthose of continental flood basalts of Paran\u00e1 Basin\n\n(Piccirillo et al. 1988).\n\nTrace elements of basic rocks are similar to\n\nthose of ocean island basalt (OIB), except for the\n\nlower Nb, Ta and P contents and higher Ba values\n\n(Fig. 3c).\n\nA roughly flat normalized REE pattern\n\nis characteristic of the low-Ti-P basic rocks, with\n\na slight LREE enrichment relative to HREE, with\n\nLaN/YbN ratios around 3, and absence of Eu ano-\n\nmaly (Fig. 3d). High-Ti-P types are REE enriched\n\nwhen compared to low-Ti-P basalts, have higher\n\nLREE/HREE ratios (LaN/YbN close to 10-11) and\n\nslight negative-Eu anomalies.\n\nThe basic magmatism lies predominantly in\n\nthe within plate field in diagrams using incompatible\n\nelements as observed in figure 4a. They show a tran-\n\nsitional pattern when compared to OIB-normalized\n\npatterns of within-plate tholeiitic and high-K basal-\n\ntic magmas (Pearce 1982, Ewart 1982). This be-\n\nhavior is characteristics for basalts of transitional or\n\nmoderately alkaline affinity, usually related to con-\n\ntinental rifts or post-collisional settings, as pointed\n\nout by Leat et al. (1986).\n\nThe acidic rocks generally have SiO2 values\n\nhigher than 70 wt%, and are probably crystallized\n\nfrom peralkaline liquids; however, due to loss of\n\nalkaline elements during crystallization (Leat et al.\n\n1986) show agpaitic index values close to 1 or even\n\nlower. The originally peralkaline affinity of this\n\nassociation is corroborated by Zr contents gener-\n\nally over 300 ppm (Table I). Volcanic rocks with\n\nlower Zr contents \u2013 about 150 ppm \u2013 and low ag-\n\npaitic index are less abundant and show character-\n\nistics similar to those of subalkaline metaluminous\n\nassociations.\n\nAssuming the primary peralkaline character of\n\nrhyolitic magmas, their comenditic affinity is con-\n\nfirmed on the FeOt \u00d7 Al2O3 diagram (MacDon-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n582 CARLOS A.

The high-Nb\n\ncomendites show more peralkaline compositions\n\nthan high and low-Ti acidic rocks, with higher Ta\n\ncontents, which are commonly referred to in pan-\n\ntelleritic associations (Hildreth 1981). The acidic\n\nrocks have FeOt/(FeOt+MgO) ratios dominantly\n\nhigher than 0.9, which are typical of rhyolites as-\n\nsociated to alkaline series (Ewart 1979, 1982).\n\nTrace element patterns of rhyolites normalized\n\nagainst the ORG values (Pearce et al. 1984.) are\n\ndisplayed in the figure 3e, where rhyolites show\n\npatterns similar to those found in within plate gra-\n\nnitic rocks, particularly of attenuated continental\n\nlithosphere. Their high Ce/Nb ratios are like those\n\nfound in post-orogenic magmatic associations, such\n\nas Snowdon Rhyolites (Leat et al. 1986). The lower\n\nCe and Sm and, higher Rb and Ta contents, together\n\nwith the lower Ce/Nb ratios of high-Nb rhyolites\n\nsuggest that this magmatism is related to sources\n\nwith less influence of subduction-related metaso-\n\nmatism, like the Naivasha Rhyolites, Kenya (Mac-\n\nDonald et al. 1987).\n\nChondrite-normalized REE patterns (Fig. 3f)\n\nshow a slight enrichment of REE in the high-Ti\n\nrhyolites, particularly for LREE, with a LaN/YbN\nratio about 10-12. The high-Nb acidic rocks pres-\n\nent LaN/YbN ratio close to 1 or 2, larger negative\n\nEu anomalies and a strong LREE depletion in the\n\nmost differentiated liquids, which probably reflect\n\nthe presence of LREE-rich minerals, like allanite,\n\namong the fractionated phases or a different source.\n\nIn the Y \u00d7 Nb diagram (Fig. 4d), the sodic\nalkaline rocks plot mainly in the field of post-\n\ncollisional magmatism, whilst high-Nb rocks oc-\n\ncupy the field closer to that of within-plate associa-\n\ntions. A similar behavior is observed in the Zr \u00d7 Nb\ndiagram (Fig. 4e) where the rhyolitic rocks in gen-\n\neral present Zr/Nb ratios > 10, which indicate that\n\nthis magmatism is related to sources modified by\n\nsubduction, such as those of post-collisional set-\n\ntings. This kind of magmatic association has been\n\ndescribed in provinces such as Snowdonia, Avoca\n\nand Parys Mountain, within the Southern British\n\nCaledonides (Leat et al. 1986). The high-Nb rocks\n\nshow Zr/Nb ratios &lt;10, which is usually related\n\nto anorogenic settings as that of Naivasha volcanic\n\nassociation, Kenya (MacDonald and Bailey 1973).\n\nIsotopic data obtained from bimodal volcan-\n\nism supplied ages varying from 549 to 602 Ma. U-\n\nPb ages within this range were obtained in zircons\n\nfrom different volcanic types (Siga Jr et al. 1995,\n\nCordani et al. 1999, Chemale Jr 2000, Sommer et\n\nal. 2005).\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe Neoproterozoic shoshonitic and mildly alkaline\n\nbimodal volcanism of Southernmost Brazil is repre-\n\nsented by rock assemblages associated to volcano-\n\nsedimentary successions, deposited in strike-slip\n\nbasins formed at the post-collisional stages of the\n\nBrasilian/Pan-African orogenic cycle. The geotec-\n\ntonic setting during this period in southern Brazil can\n\nbe envisaged as resultant from the collisional system\n\nassociated with the amalgamation of Rio de La Plata,\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco, Congo, Kalahari and Paran\u00e1 cratons,\n\nas suggested by Brito Neves and Cordani (1991),\n\nleading to the formation of Gondwana superconti-\n\nnent. The influence of collisions related to the Pam-\n\npean Orogeny (Rapela et al. 1998) in the develop-\n\nment of Cambrian shear belts in southern Brazil can\n\nnot be discarded, particularly for late-transcurrent\n\nevents such as that related to the Ca\u00e7apava Granite\n\nComplex intrusion with age of 550 Ma (Nardi and\n\nBitencourt 1989). This long period of transcurrent\n\ntectonics with associated strike-slip basin formation\n\nand associated magmatism, related to the consolida-\n\ntion of Gondwana supercontinent, explains the wide\n\ntime interval of Brasiliano post-collisional magma-\n\ntism in southern Brazil (650\u2013540 Ma).\n\nThe best-preserved volcano-sedimentary asso-\n\nciations occur in the Camaqu\u00e3 and Campo Alegre\n\nBasins, respectively in the Sul-rio-grandense and\n\nCatarinense Shields and are outside the main shear\n\nbelts or overlying the unaffected basement areas.\n\nThese basins are characterized by alternation of vol-\n\ncanic cycles and siliciclastic sedimentation devel-\n\noped dominantly on a continental setting under sub-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n584 CARLOS A.

These ages are coherent with those found\n\nin the coeval extensional granitic plutonism, indicat-\n\ning that evolution of shoshonitic and mildly alkaline\n\nbimodal magmatism was developed during at least\n\n60 Ma.\n\nBimodal volcanism was carried out over Paleo-\n\nproterozoic granulitic complexes or over metamor-\n\nphic terrains with juvenile protoliths and in spite of\n\nthese basement differences, volcanic episodes and\n\nfacies architecture in the studied basins are similar,\n\nwith a predominance of acidic over basic magma-\n\ntism and an less expressive occurrence of intermedi-\n\nate rocks, mainly trachytic lavas and small syenitic\n\nplutons (Wildner et al. 2002, Waichel et al. 2000).\n\nThe bimodal magmatism according to mineralog-\n\nical, trace and major element data belongs to the\n\nsilica-saturated sodic alkaline series and shows high\n\nFeOT/MgO ratios comparable to those of continental\n\nflood basalts. Two magmatic sequences were iden-\n\ntified and referred to as high-Ti-P basalts-rhyolites\n\nand low-Ti-P basalts-rhyolites.\n\nThe compositional differences observed in the\n\nhigh- and low-Ti-P groups are attributed to different\n\nmelt fractions from a dominantly lithospheric man-\n\ntle, previously affected by subduction (Wildner et\n\nal. 2002, Sommer et al. 2005).\n\nThe volcanic cycles investigated in Neopro-\n\nterozoic basins of southernmost Brazil represent part\n\nof evolutionary sequences that are typical of post-\n\ncollisional magmatism. This magmatism marks the\n\nfinal stages of the post-collisional period and the\n\nexhausting of mantle reservoirs hydrated and meta-\n\nsomatized by processes related to a previous sub-\n\nduction. The latest volcanism, characterized by the\n\nhigh-Nb rhyolites, probably represents an astheno-\n\nspheric contribution and can be interpreted as result\n\nof slab break-off and asthenospheric upwelling as\n\nproposed by Atherton and Ghani (2002).\n\nThe post-collisional magmatism evolution\n\nfrom high-K subalkaline to shoshonitic and eventu-\n\nally to sodic mildly alkaline observed in southern-\n\nmost Brazil (Nardi and Bonin 1991, Bitencourt and\n\nNardi 1993, 2000, Gastal and Lafon 1998, 2001,\n\nWildner et al. 2002, Waichel et al. 2000, Som-\n\nmer et al. 2005, Nardi and Lima 2000) is referred\n\nelsewhere as in Snowdonia and Parys Mountain as-\n\nsociations in the British Caledonides (Leat et al.\n\n1986), Devine Canyon Tuff \u2013 USA (Greene 1973)\n\nand Miocene post-collisional volcanism of the East-\n\nern Rif in Morocco (El Bakkali et al. 1998). This\n\nevolution is characterized by development of shear\n\nbelts associated to predominantly granitic magma-\n\ntism and strike-slip basins where a typical and vo-\n\nluminous volcanism and associated sedimentation\n\nwas developed and preserved, as envisaged by Bonin\n\n(2004) for the evolution of the Alpine Belt since the\n\nend of Variscan orogeny in Europe.\n\nThe post-collisional magmatism in southern\n\nBrazil shows some particular features that should\n\nbe emphasized: (i) the last post-collisional mag-\n\nmatic events are sodic instead of potassic or ultra-\n\npotassic and (ii) the early magmatic stages of mafic\n\nmagmatism are dominantly high-K tholeiitic instead\n\nof calc-alkaline (ii) the ultrapotassic lamprophyre-\n\nsyenitic magmatism (611 Ma; Pl\u00e1 Cid et al. 2003)\n\nis approximately coeval with the shoshonitic one.\n\nThe compositional variation and evolution of post-\n\ncollisional magmatism in southern Brazil is inter-\n\npreted as result mainly of melting of a heterogeneous\n\nmantle source, which includes garnet-phlogopite-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n586 CARLOS A. SOMMER et al.\n\nbearing peridotites, veined-peridotites with abun-\n\ndant hydrated phases, such as amphibole, apatite\n\nand phlogopite, and eventually with the addition\n\nof an asthenospheric component. Crustal melts are\n\nsignificative within the major post-collision shear\n\nbelts where peraluminous acidic rocks have been\n\ndescribed by several authors (e.g. Bitencourt and\n\nNardi 1993). The subduction-related metasomatic\n\ncharacter of post-collisional magmatism mantle\n\nsources in southern Brazil is put in evidence by Nb-\n\nnegative anomalies and isotope features typical of\n\nEM1 sources.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was financially supported by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nde Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do\n\nSul (FAPERGS \u2013 03/0686.2 and BIC 03/50288.0)\n\nand Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00ed-\n\nfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico/Programa de Apoio a N\u00facleos de\n\nExcel\u00eancia (CNPq/PRONEX \u2013 4700181/01-5 and\n\n471584/2001-0).
