This undesirable adverse \neffect has been related to the ability of HP to disrupt the \nmineral structure of enamel (2), which allows HP diffusion \nto the subjacent dentin and pulp chamber (3). Therefore, \nat-home tooth bleaching technique has been considered \nas an interesting alternative for bleaching teeth without \ncausing toxic effects to pulp tissue. This esthetic procedure \nis based on patient wearing a custom-made tray filled \nwith low concentrations of carbamide peroxide (CP) or \nHP gels (4). \n\nCurrently, several researchers are looking for tooth \nbleaching techniques that are at the same time effective \nand safe for dental tissues (1). Low-concentration HP (15-\n20%) gels for in-office therapy provide effective bleaching \nassociated with less intense and prevalent tooth sensitivity \n(5,6). The CP-based gels have the advantage of promoting \na slow and gradual release of HP, which prevents its quick \n\ndiffusion through enamel and dentin at high concentrations \n(7). The 10% CP gel has been considered a safe bleaching \ntechnique for tooth structure, since several studies \ndemonstrated low incidence of post-operative sensitivity \n(8) and low trans-enamel and trans-dentinal cytotoxicity \n(4). A recent in vivo study also demonstrated that night-\nguard vital bleaching with 10% CP gel provides patient \nsatisfaction with minimal side effects up to 17 years post-\ntreatment (9). However, some patients complain about the \nlong treatment time required for this technique.\n\nTo fulfill patient requirement of faster tooth bleaching \noutcomes, CP-based gels with concentrations varying from \n15 to 22% have been currently recommended. However, \nonly a few studies evaluated the effects of these products \non tooth structure (4,10-15). A recent investigation showed \nthat 16% CP gel caused higher trans-enamel and trans-\ndentinal toxic effects to pulp cells than 10% CP gel, which \nmay have been favored by the more intense enamel changes \ntriggered by the 16% CP gel (4). However, as the effects of \n16% CP gel on dental enamel as well as on pulp cells are \nstill controversial, a rational approach is probably to carry \nout studies to clarify these topics. Therefore, the aim of this \nstudy was to evaluate the microhardness, mineral content, \nroughness and topography of dental enamel bleached with \n\nISSN 0103-6440Brazilian Dental Journal (2013) 24(5): 517-521\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-6440201302225\n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 24(5) 2013 \n\n518\n\nD\n.G\n\n.

The blocks were embedded in autopolymerizing \nacrylic resin (Vipi Flash; Vipi Ltda., Pirassununga, SP, Brazil) \nand the outer enamel surface was polished with wet 320-, \n600-, 1200- and 1500-grit silicon carbide paper (T469-SF; \nNorton - Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda., Jundia\u00ed, SP, Brazil) in \na polishing machine (Panambra DP-10; Panambra Industrial \ne T\u00e9cnica S.A., S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) followed by hand \npolishing with 6, 3 and 1 \u00b5m (Arotec; Arotec S.A., Cotia, SP, \nBrazil) diamond pastes intercalating ultrasonication with \ndistilled water to eliminate paste residues. The specimens \nwere rinsed with distilled water after the final polishing \nwith 1 \u00b5m diamond paste. \n\nBleaching Procedure\nBleaching gels containing 10% or 16% CP (Whiteness \n\nHP; FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) were evaluated. These gels are \nidentical in composition, except for the HP content, having \na neutral pH. The specimens were randomly assigned to the \nfollowing 3 groups (n=12): CG - control (no bleaching); \nG10 - 10% CP bleaching gel application; G16 \u2013 16% CP \nbleaching gel application. \n\nIn G10 and G16, the surface of each enamel block was \nwashed with 1 mL of sterile deionized water, dried with \nabsorbent paper and then 30 mg of either of the bleaching \ngels was applied on enamel for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C. After this, the \ngel was aspirated, enamel surface was thoroughly rinsed \nwith sterile deionized water and maintained in artificial \nsaliva for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C. These procedures were repeated for \n14 consecutive days. In CG, the enamel surface remained in \ncontact with deionized water during the bleaching time (8 \nh) followed by storage in artificial saliva (16 h) (4).\n\nKnoop Microhardness\nEnamel microhardness was evaluated in 12 specimens \n\nper group using a microhardness meter with a square base \ndiamond pyramid Knoop hardness indenter (Buehler, Lake \nBluff, IL, USA). The analysis was performed before bleaching \n(baseline) and after 1, 7 and 14 days of bleaching protocol \nin each specimen. Each indentation was made with a 50 g \nstatic load for 15 s. Five indentations were made in each \nspecimen at each evaluation period, within an area of 1.0 \nmm2 on enamel surface, equidistant from each other 0.1 \nmm horizontally and 0.5 mm vertically. An average of the \n5 indentations of each period was obtained. Data were \nsubmitted to two-way ANOVA (\u201cgroup\u201d and \u201cperiod\u201d), \ncomplemented by Tukey\u2019s test for multiple comparisons \n\nat a significance level of 5%.\n\nAnalysis of Mineral Content by Energy-Dispersive \nX-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX)\n\nThe mineral content of enamel was assessed in the same \nspecimens used for microhardness analysis at the end of \nthe experimental protocol. Six specimens of each group \nwere examined by SEM-EDX at the 14 th day. An EDX probe \ncoupled to a scanning electron microscope (Philips FEG \nXL 30; Oxford Instruments, Inc., Concord, MA, USA) at 25 \nkV accelerating voltage, 100 ?A illuminating current and \n100-second counting time was used. In each specimen, \nanalyses of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content of \nenamel (%) were carried out in three equidistant points \ndistributed diagonally along the test surface and the \naverage value was statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA \nand Tukey\u2019s test at a significance level of 5%.\n\nAnalysis of Surface Roughness and Topography by \nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\n\nIn the other six specimens of each group subjected \nto the microhardness test, surface roughness and surface \ntopography were evaluated with an atomic force microscope \n(Alpha 300AR; Witec, Ulm, Germany) at the 14 th day for \neach group. The topography of the specimens was examined \nwithin an area of 70 x 70 \u00b5m2 in 3 different positions \nin each sample. All AFM measurements were conducted \nwith the tip working in AC-mode (tapping mode) and the \naverage values from the 3 measurements were submitted \nto statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test; \n?=5%). The WSxMV 3.1 software (Nanotec Electr\u00f3nica \nS.L., Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain) transformed the obtained \ndata in 3D images for subsequent analysis of the results. \nThe results were three 3D images of the surface for each \nqualitatively examined specimen.\n\nTable 1.

Bleaching with 10% CP gel \n(G10) caused a significant decrease in enamel microhardness \nafter 7 and 14 days of treatment compared with baseline \n(p<0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was \nobserved between these two periods (p>0.05). Enamel \nmicrohardness was significantly lower in G16 than in CG \nafter all bleaching times (p<0.05). Comparing the three \nbleaching times within G16, no significant difference was \nfound between the 1- and 7-day times (p>0.05); however, \nsignificantly lower microhardness values were observed \nafter 14 days of bleaching treatment (p<0.05).\n\nAnalysis of Mineral Content by Energy-Dispersive \nX-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX)\n\nNo statistically significant difference was observed \nbetween G10 and G16 (p>0.05; Fig. 1A). However, both \nbleached groups presented a significantly lower Ca and P \ncontent on enamel compared with the non-bleached CG \n(Fig. 1) (p<0.05). \n\nAnalysis of Surface Roughness and Topography by \n\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\n\nNo significant difference was observed between \nG10 and G16 (p>0.05); but both bleached groups had \na significantly higher surface roughness compared with \nthe non-bleached CG (Fig. 2) (p<0.05). Regarding the \ntopography, enamel surfaces in the bleached groups were \nmore irregular than in CG, exhibiting more numerous \nand deeper peaks and valleys, suggesting a more evident \nmicroporous layer on this tissue (Figs. 3B and C), especially \nin the specimens bleached with the 16% CP gel (Fig. 3C).\n\nDiscussion\nIn spite of being considered a safe technique for dental \n\nstructures, the in-home bleaching therapy using 10% CP \nbleaching gel requires a long time to reach a desirable \nesthetic outcome (2 to 4 weeks) (4). A recent study \ndemonstrated that it is possible to speed up the whitening \neffect of this technique by increasing CP concentration \n(15). However, the negative effects of high concentration \nCP bleaching gels on this hard dental tissue structure were \nscarcely studied. \n\nAccording to the results of the present study, higher \nCP concentration in the bleaching gel results in higher \nand faster decrease of dental enamel microhardness. This \nalteration has been correlated to the oxidative action of HP \non the organic phase of this hard tissue (2). Disruption of \n\nFigure 1. EDX Analysis.

S\noa\n\nre\ns \n\net\n a\n\nl.\n\nthe enamel organic matrix results in loss of the crystalline \nmaterial sketched out of this matrix, leaving zones of \nerosion intercalated with areas of intact enamel, resulting \nin a rough surface (16,17). The presence of nitrogen and \noxygen molecules on bleached enamel surface, probably \ndue to the interaction of peroxide with the enamel proteins, \nsuggests that HP is able of dissolving the enamel organic \nmatrix (3). The results of the present investigation may \nconfirm this hypothesis, since reduction of Ca and P content \nwas observed after bleaching, associated with increase of \nenamel surface roughness. Therefore, as the compositions \nof both gels used in this study are identical except for the \nCP concentration, it may be suggested that the greater \naggressiveness caused by 16% CP gel in the present \nstudy was due to the release of higher HP concentrations \ncompared to the 10% CP gel. \n\nSeveral studies demonstrated that the effects of \nbleaching agents on dental enamel might vary from \ninsignificant up to deep alterations on its structure and \nmorphology, depending on the bleaching protocol (18-20). \nAs observed in the present investigation, some studies \ndemonstrated that application of 16% CP gel also causes \nmore intense morphological changes on enamel surface \n\nand reduction of enamel microhardness compared to low-\nconcentration CP-gels (10-12). On the other hand, other \nstudies did not observe significant differences on dental \nenamel structure between bleached or non-bleached \nsurfaces (21-23), and also among different concentrations \nof the CP-gels (23). In these investigations, the enamel \nsurface was bleached in an in situ environment. In this \ncondition, there is an influx of saliva, which presents \nremineralizing ions such as fluoride, calcium and phosphates \n(18). However, at the moment of bleaching procedure, \nincrease of enamel porosity allows HP penetration on deep \nenamel and consequently into the pulp chamber (2,3). A \nrecent study demonstrated that even when applied onto \nremineralized enamel by fluoride, the 16% CP gel was \nstill toxic to the odontoblast-like cells, with no significant \ndifference from the non-fluoride treated enamel (24).\n\nIn this way, the high-concentration CP gels appear to \npromote greater alteration on dental structure, resulting in a \nmore intense trans-enamel and trans-dentinal HP diffusion, \nas previously demonstrated (4). According to the authors, \nthe slight increase in CP bleaching gel concentration (from \n10% to 16% CP gel) may be accompanied by significantly \ngreater deleterious effects to pulp cells. Based on the \nresults of the present study, it is believed that this increased \ntoxicity is a result of more alteration of the mineralized \ndental tissues, allowing a higher influx of HP into tooth \nstructure. This hypothesis is confirmed by clinical studies, \nwhich demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of \ntooth sensitivity for patients who used 20% CP gel (71.4%) \ncompared with 10% CP gel (36.8%) (25). Other studies \ndemonstrated that the 16% CP gel presents similar results \nof tooth sensitivity as the in-office bleaching protocol with \n35% HP gel (13,14).\n\nThis way, since the higher CP concentration causes \nhigher toxic effects in the pulp cells (3), more intense and \nprevalent tooth sensitivity (8,25), and higher modifications \non the mineralized phase of teeth (10-12), with no benefits \nin the final esthetic outcome (14,15,25), the 10% CP gel \nappears to be an interesting alternative for tooth bleaching \n\nFigure 2.

However, the 16% CP gel promoted \nthe most intense alterations on enamel, even after a single \n8-h application.\n\nResumo\nO objetivo do presente estudo foi comparar o efeito de um gel com 16% \nde per\u00f3xido de carbamida (PC) sobre a estrutura mineral e morfologia \ndo esmalte dental com os efeitos de um gel com 10% de PC.
