This goes as well for the project\u2019s funding responsible \n\npersonnel, without whom none of the field work would be possible. I\u2019m grateful to have \n\nmet the project leader Mag. Irene Weinberger, who was both a teacher and a friend to \n\nme. I owe her my radio-telemetry and orientation skills (never will I be lost again in \n\npresence of a map!). Also, I wish to thank all field assistants who helped me collecting \n\nthe data I needed for this present work. A last mention to two of the greatest \u201cotter \n\npeople\u201d I had the pleasure to meet: Addy de Jongh and Tjibee Jong (without whom \n\nthere would be no otters to study!). \n\n \n\nWhile not directly involved with my MSc thesis, Dr. Stefan Schindler was definitely a \n\nkey person in my ERASMUS to Vienna. For his kindness and availability to help me, \n\nwithout knowing who I was, he deserves my respect and appreciation. \n\n \n\nVielen dank to my foreign family, the Altenberger\u2019s, who gave me a home far away \n\nfrom mine and so much, much more. \n\n \n\nTo my FCULianos (Adriana, Francisco, Gon\u00e7alo, Marta, Renata &amp; Sofia), in particular \n\nto the Fellowship of the Thesis, for all the fun, companionship and brainstorming they \n\ntook part in. To those who are far away on their own adventures (Jo\u00e3o &amp; Pio). And also \n\nto my other friends, which circumstances made us distant. My thanks to Ricardo, or as I \n\ncall him: the Santa Claus of nowhere-to-be-found articles. \n\n \n\nLast, but definitely not the least, my immeasurable gratitude goes to my family, \n\nespecially to my mother. And I\u2019m sure Becas would have liked to meet \u201cmy\u201d otters (if \n\nhe was not too busy running away!). \n\n \n\nTo Stefan, who was (is!) behind my motivations to travel to Austria, for all the love, \n\ncare and understanding (especially when I was in \u201cdragon\u201d mode). \n\n\n\n ii \n\nABSTRACT \n \n \n \n \nThe availability of resting sites is known to influence the distribution and density of \n\nanimals and they are key resources to nocturnal mammals that need to spend daylight in \n\nsafe refuges. This is the reason why these structures have to be taken in account in the \n\nefforts of mammal species conservation. Aside from being simply a place to rest, these \n\nstructures also provide natural protection against predators and thermal isolation in \n\nharsh environments. In the 1960\u2019s Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) crashed in many parts of \n\nits European distribution, this being the case of Austria. With the species re-\n\ncolonization, favored by an interconnection with the Czech and the Hungarian \n\npopulations, a need emerged for a better understanding on how animals are using such \n\nresources in the Alpine landscape as the species is still considered endangered. \n\nThe main goals of this study were to evaluate (assess) if: (1) there is a structural pattern \n\nof daytime resting site according to gender and age; (2) human disturbance affects the \n\nchoice of resting site type; (3) snow cover has any influence on the type of resting site \n\nused; (4) rest-site choice can be predicted based on environmental variables and (5) \n\nthere is a geographic pattern in resting site choice. \n\nFour otters (two adult females, one adult male and one juvenile female) were captured \n\nand radio-tagged to locate resting structures which were characterized according to a set \n\nof physical and environmental parameters. Daily climate data was obtained from local \n\nweather stations. \n\nIn spite of sampling size constrains results revealed that underground structures were \n\nused more often than surface lairs and suggest a different use of resting site type \n\nbetween females and breeding females. No relation was found between rest-site type \n\nand human density. Snow cover influence could not be asserted due to environmental \n\nconditions during the sampling period, but temperature, vegetation cover and river \n\nwidth seem to play a significant role in predicting resting site choice. Concerning the \n\ngeographical pattern, the results, framed by previous studies, imply its existence but it \n\nwas not possible to identify the factors behind it. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Eurasian otter, Resting ecology, Resting sites use pattern, Radio-telemetry \n\n\n\n iii \n\nRESUMO  \n\n \n \n\nPertencendo \u00e0 fam\u00edlia dos mustel\u00eddeos, a lontra Euroasi\u00e1tica (Lutra lutra L. 1758) \u00e9 a \n\nesp\u00e9cie de lontra cuja distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 mais alargada. Pode ser encontrada na Europa, na \n\nmaior parte da \u00c1sia e ainda no Norte de \u00c1frica. \u00c9 uma esp\u00e9cie exclusivamente aqu\u00e1tica \n\nque utiliza tanto sistemas l\u00eanticos como sistemas l\u00f3ticos e ainda zonas costeiras. S\u00e3o \n\nanimais solit\u00e1rios ao longo da sua vida, alimentando-se na sua maioria de peixes, \n\nembora possam alimentar-se de v\u00e1rios outros grupos animais. Esta esp\u00e9cie, \u00e0 \n\nsemelhan\u00e7a de outros mam\u00edferos, passa uma grande parte do dia no interior de abrigos. \n\nEstas estruturas conferem-lhes protec\u00e7\u00e3o contra predadores e isolamento t\u00e9rmico, al\u00e9m \n\nde um local para dormir. Os ref\u00fagios desenpenham um papel fundamental no ciclo de \n\nvida dos animais, podendo em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de escassez, determinar a sua densidade e \n\nabund\u00e2ncia.  \n\nNa d\u00e9cada de 1960 as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de lontra sofreram um decl\u00ednio acentuado em grande \n\nparte da sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o original. Este sentiu-se principalmente a n\u00edvel Europeu, \n\nembora a situa\u00e7\u00e3o seja maioritariamente desconhecida para outros locais da sua \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o. Alguns pa\u00edses, como a Su\u00ed\u00e7a, chegaram mesmo a uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o de extin\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlocal, da qual apenas recentemente come\u00e7am a recuperar. Apesar das causas deste \n\ndecl\u00ednio serem variadas, todas t\u00eam em comum a sua origem humana. As quatro amea\u00e7as \n\nprincipais devem-se \u00e0 persegui\u00e7\u00e3o directa, destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat, polui\u00e7\u00e3o por metais \n\npesados e rarefac\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos alimentares.  \n\nCom o aumento do n\u00famero de lontras a re-colonizarem a parte Este dos Alpes, torna-se \n\nfundamental compreender melhor determinados aspectos da sua ecologia nos sistemas \n\nfluviais Alpinos.  \n\nO presente estudo teve por objectivo a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es de \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de abrigos diurnos por parte da lontra no Sudoeste Austr\u00edaco. Foram testadas \n\nas seguintes hip\u00f3teses: (1) existe um tipo estrutural de abrigo mais usado consoante a \n\nidade e sexo dos indiv\u00edduos; (2) abrigos mais expostos ser\u00e3o utilizados em \u00e1reas menos \n\nperturbadas e vice versa; (3) ap\u00f3s a chegada da neve, locais que beneficiem de \n\nisolamento t\u00e9rmico ser\u00e3o mais usados; (4) \u00e9 poss\u00edvel prever o tipo de estrutura \n\nescolhido com base em vari\u00e1veis ambientais e (5) existe um padr\u00e3o de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ngeogr\u00e1fico dos v\u00e1rios tipos de abrigo.  \n\n\n\n iv \n\nPara responder \u00e0s quest\u00f5es colocadas, recorreu-se \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de radio-marca\u00e7\u00e3o e de \n\nr\u00e1dio-telemetria. Foram efectuadas 2 sess\u00f5es de armadilhagem (Maio 2010 e Novembro \n\n2010), que resultaram na captura de 4 indiv\u00edduos, dos quais duas f\u00eameas adultas, um \n\nmacho e uma f\u00eamea juvenil. Os animais foram localizados 47 a 187 vezes ao longo de 9 \n\nmeses. Sempre que um indiv\u00edduo era localizado e considerado inactivo, registaram-se as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas do abrigo e factores do ambiente envolvente tais como vari\u00e1veis \n\nrelacionadas com o curso de \u00e1gua, como largura, profundidade e tipo de margem; e \n\noutras relacionadas com a presen\u00e7a humana, como dist\u00e2ncia a estradas e povoa\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nAl\u00e9m destas caracter\u00edsitcas, registou-se ainda o tipo de habitat em que os abrigos se \n\ninseriam e a sua constitui\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural, resultando em cinco tipos diferentes de abrigo. \n\nPosteriormente, foram obtidos dados relativos \u00e0s temperaturas di\u00e1rias min\u00edmas e \n\nm\u00e1ximas, bem como \u00e0 precipita\u00e7\u00e3o di\u00e1ria. Estes dados foram obtidos em duas esta\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmeteorol\u00f3gicas localizadas na \u00e1rea de estudo recorrendo-se aos dados da esta\u00e7\u00e3o mais \n\npr\u00f3xima ao territ\u00f3rio de cada animal. \n\nPor os dados n\u00e3o cumprirem os pressupostos da estat\u00edstica param\u00e9trica na an\u00e1lise dos \n\ndados foi utilizada estat\u00edstica n\u00e3o-param\u00e9trica. De modo a facilitar o tratamento de \n\ndados, os animais foram agrupados em tr\u00eas classes: f\u00eameas, macho e f\u00eameas com crias. \n\nPara analisar a fidelidade dos indiv\u00edduos aos abrigos, calculou-se o \u00edndice de \n\nreutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o correspondente. O mesmo \u00edndice, foi tamb\u00e9m comparado para cada tipo de \n\nabrigo antes e depois da cobertura de neve se instalar. Foi ainda calculado para cada \n\nabrigo a sua frequ\u00eancia de uso relativa, de modo a determinar a exist\u00eancia de uma \n\nprefer\u00eancia por um ou mais tipos de abrigo. De modo a evidenciar padr\u00f5es estruturais \n\ndos v\u00e1rios tipos de abrigo, foi realizada uma an\u00e1lise de ordena\u00e7\u00e3o. Os resultados desta \n\nordena\u00e7\u00e3o indicaram a separa\u00e7\u00e3o de dois tipos de abrigos: de superf\u00edcie ou no subsolo. \n\nSeguidamente foi efectuada uma an\u00e1lise de regress\u00e3o log\u00edstica testando-se a exist\u00eancia \n\nou n\u00e3o de correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre as vari\u00e1veis originais. Foram introduzidas dez vari\u00e1veis no \n\nmodelo inicial, sendo reduzidas a quatro ap\u00f3s um procedimento de backward stepwise. \n\nAp\u00f3s a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o de que o modelo final e o modelo inicial n\u00e3o eram \n\nsignificativamente diferentes, testou-se a adequabilidade e precis\u00e3o do modelo final.  \n\nConstatou-se que n\u00e3o existem diferen\u00e7as estat\u00edsticas entre a taxa de reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das tr\u00eas \n\nclasses de indiv\u00edduos, embora os dados sugiram uma diferen\u00e7a ao n\u00edvel das f\u00eameas \n\nreprodutoras e n\u00e3o reprodutoras. N\u00e3o existiu tamb\u00e9m uma diferen\u00e7a ao n\u00edvel da \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de abrigos consoante a presen\u00e7a/aus\u00eancia de cobertura de neve. Este \n\nresultado estar\u00e1 provavelmente relacionado com a \u00e9poca em que tr\u00eas dos indiv\u00edduos \n\n\n\n v \n\nforam capturados, j\u00e1 que a temperatura do ar j\u00e1 estava a decrescer antes dos animais \n\ncome\u00e7arem a ser seguidos. \n\nEmbora n\u00e3o tivesse sido poss\u00edvel concluir \u00e0cerca de uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre \u00e1reas muito ou \n\npouco humanizadas e o tipo de abrigo, confirmou-se a reac\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie \u00e0 presen\u00e7a \n\nhumana, em que apenas pertuba\u00e7\u00f5es de cariz directo, causaram a fuga do animal. Na \n\nmaioria das situa\u00e7\u00f5es, o indiv\u00edduo permaneceu no abrigo, apesar de alguma pertuba\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nbastante pr\u00f3xima. \n\nAs vari\u00e1veis estatisticamente relevantes obtidas no modelo de associa\u00e7\u00e3o abrigo-habitat \n\nforam a temperatura, a cobertura vegetal e a largura do rio. Segundo os coeficientes \n\nobtidos, quanto mais elevada for a temperatura, maior \u00e9 a probabilidade de um abrigo \u00e0 \n\nsuperf\u00edcie ser escolhido. O contr\u00e1rio acontece quando a temperatuda desce. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00e0 vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, esta tem um papel muito importante na exist\u00eancia de abrigos, j\u00e1 que \u00e9 \n\nrespons\u00e1vel (directa ou indirectamente) por muitos dos abrigos utilizados. Uma menor \n\nlargura do rio est\u00e1 relacionada, embora n\u00e3o t\u00e3o claramente como as vari\u00e1veis anteriores, \n\ncom a escolha de abrigos \u00e0 superf\u00edcie.  \n\nEmbora existam ind\u00edcios de que existir\u00e1 um padr\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fico, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel \n\ndiscernir que factores estar\u00e3o na origem desse padr\u00e3o.  \n\nDemonstrou-se a import\u00e2ncia de algumas estruturas resultantes de actividade humana; \n\nos abrigos constitu\u00eddos de pilhas de ramos ou troncos foram bastante utilizados. Assim, \n\nrecomenda-se que a sua gest\u00e3o se mantenha como at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o, de modo a permitir a sua \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua.  \n\nTendo em conta o tamanho da amostra, alguns resultados n\u00e3o significativos podem estar \n\na ser mascarados. De modo a confirmar estas situa\u00e7\u00f5es, seria necess\u00e1rio analisar uma \n\namostra maior.

Mustelids, as many other mammals, are mostly \n\nnocturnal and spend the majority of the day concealed inside resting structures (e.g. \n\nBeja 1996, Kowalczyk et al. 2004; Baghli &amp; Verhagen 2005). While offering thermal \n\nisolation (L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00edn et al. 2005), these structures also provide natural protection \n\nagainst predators (Buskirk 1984; Lesmeister et al. 2008) aside from being simply a \n\nplace to rest. Avoiding predation has obvious advantages, whilst thermoregulation is \n\ncostly for this animal group (Weber 1989) due to their elongated body shape. Besides \n\nthese factors, there are others shaping the rest-site choice, like their location regarding a \n\nfood source (Lutermann et al. 2010) or the presence of an escape route (Ruggiero et al. \n\n1998). For these reasons, the location of these sites is rarely arbitrary. For example, \n\nAmerican pine martens (Martes americana) use mainly other animal\u2019s nests (Buskirk \n\n1984) and resting site choice is associated with thermal benefits (Spencer 1987). \n\nPolecats\u2019 (Mustela putorius) choice seems to be dependent both on food availability and \n\nsufficient warmth (Weber 1989). In the end, site preferences depend on different \n\nfactors, because individuals tend to select habitat characteristics that maximize their \n\nfitness in conformity with their current biological needs (Szor et al. 2008). As a result, \n\nthe occurrence of fitting resting sites is determinant for considering a habitat as suitable \n\n(Fern\u00e1ndez &amp; Palomares, 2000). \n\nFor mustelids, lower numbers of suitable resting sites can diminish their \n\ndensities and increase intraspecific competition for this resource (Zalewski 1997a; \n\nPurcell et al. 2009). In these conditions, rest-site availability may shape the territory \n\nsize (Zalewski 1997b) as the use of certain sites \u201ccan influence an animal\u2019s time- and \n\nenergy-budget\u201d (Weber, 1989).  \n\n \n\nEurasian otters \n\nOtters (Lutra lutra) are one of the few amphibian groups of mustelids, being \n\nrepresented by 13 species belonging to the Lutrinae subfamily (Mason &amp; Macdonald \n\n1986). Of all otters, merely one species of river otter can be found throughout Europe: \n\nthe Eurasian river otter (Lutra lutra, L. 1758). Eurasian otters\u2019 distribution includes, as \n\nthe name says, Europe and Asia but it can also be found in a small region on the North \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nof Africa (Conroy &amp; Chanin 2002). This otter occupies a variety of habitats, being \n\nfound in freshwater systems, either lotic (rivers and streams) or lentic (lakes, pounds, \n\nswamps and, recently, dam\u2019s reservoirs) (Mason &amp; Macdonald 1986; Kruuk 2006). \n\nSurprisingly, it can also dwell in coastal systems, providing a freshwater source is near \n\n(Beja 1989). Feeding mostly on fish, this mustelid also takes in its diet a diversity of \n\nother species like amphibians, crustaceans (Mason &amp; Macdonald 1986; Kruuk 2006), \n\nreptiles (Remonti et al. 2009), small birds and even some small mammals like rabbits \n\n(Carss 1995). Otters, as the majority of mustelids, are solitary single-living species \n\n(Erlinge 1968). \n\nDue to their secretive and largely nocturnal habits and little individual \n\ndistinctiveness, otters are extremely difficult to study (Macdonald &amp; Mason 1994; Kalz \n\net al. 2006). For these reasons, this animal has been mainly studied through the use of \n\nsigns of presence, like spraints and footprints (White et al. 2002). Other methods using \n\ninfrared technology are also being tested and developed (Garcia de Leandiz et al. 2006) \n\nin order to monitor elusive riparian mammals. \n\nMelquist &amp; Hornocker (1983) were the first to use radio-telemetry in otters \n\n(Lutra canadensis) in Idaho. Green and his team (1984) published an extensive article \n\nabout radio-tracked otters (Lutra lutra) in northern Scotland. Both Green et al. (1984) \n\nand Rosoux &amp; Libois (1996) used radio-collars modified into harnesses. However, this \n\nmethodology was abandoned and intra-peritoneal implanted transmitters were used \n\ninstead (e.g. Kruuk et al. 1998). Most radio-telemetry efforts focus on reintroduction \n\nstudies (e.g. Sj\u00f6\u00e5sen 1996; Saavedra 2002) or habitat selection (e.g. Ruiz-Olmo et al. \n\n2005) and just a few on resting sites (Beja 1996; Jimen\u00e9z &amp; Palomo 1998). \n\nNevertheless, rest structures began to be studied before the radio-tagging of individuals. \n\nErlinge (1967) described underground rest structures with two entrances, being one of \n\nthem underwater, as a typical otter resting site. With the arrival of radio-telemetry, it \n\nwas discovered that rest sites with these precise characteristics are scarcely found, and \n\nrest structures are frequently undetectable without this technique (Green et al. 1984). \n\nMoreover, otters seem to use resting sites opportunistically and do not usually build \n\nthem, profiting from other animals\u2019 burrows (Erlinge 1967). \n\n \n\nEuropean background and present situation \n\nCentral European countries (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Austria) were \n\nlargely affected by the Lutra lutra population crash in 1960\u2019s (Macdonald &amp; Mason \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n1994). The same is true for other countries were Eurasian otter is found, but since the \n\npresent project is being developed in the Alps region, emphases will be made on this \n\narea. Otter situation is mostly unknown in Asian countries, though researchers like Cho \n\net al. (2009) are now beginning to fill this gap. There are many combined causes related \n\nto the general decline in otter numbers, felt in Europe in the second half of the XX \n\ncentury. In one way or another, all of them are exclusively related to human activity \n\n(Mason &amp; Macdonald 1986). These causes can be included in four major threath \n\ncategories: direct persecution, habitat destruction, habitat degradation by pollution and \n\nsimply the lack of food supplies (Saavedra 2002; Bedford 2009). \n\nWhile vulnerable to the threats mentioned above, otters benefit now from a good \n\nconservation management, allowing them to slowly recover from the decline felt \n\ndecades earlier. There is now evidence from several European countries of an increase \n\nin otter numbers (e.g. Kranz et al. 2001; Conroy &amp; Chanin 2002). This is mainly due to \n\nthree reasons: i) the fact that otters are protected in almost every European country \n\n(Saavedra 2002), ii) a heavier control of pollutants like PCBs through EU legislation \n\n(Simpson et al. 2000) and iii) the development of pisciculture activities, providing new \n\nhabitat opportunities particularly in terms of prey (Kranz et al. 1996).  \n\n \n\nAustrian context \n\nThe status of this species varies significantly between different parts of Austria \n\n(Gutleb 1992). Despite the fact that 80% of the country can be deemed \u201cotter-free\u201d \n\n(Bodner 1995), Lutra lutra can be found at least in four counties: Lower Austria, Upper \n\nAustria, Styria and Burgenland (Gutleb 1992). There has been recent evidence of an \n\nincrease in otter numbers (Kranz 1994), as they are favored by an interconnection with \n\ntwo other populations (Czech Republic\u2019s and Hungary\u2019s) (Kranz et al. 2001). However, \n\nthe species is still regarded as endangered in Austria (Conroy &amp; Chanin 2002). While \n\nthere have been evidences of illegal hunting actions, several carcasses with old \n\nfragments of bullets having being found in the Lower Austria county (Gutleb et al. \n\n1995), it is forbidden to hunt otters in Austria since 1947 (Bodner 1994). On the origin \n\nof these human-otter conflicts is probably the increase of fish-farms in the same region.  \n\n \n\nProject Lutra alpina, in the frame of which this study was conducted, is being \n\nfinanced by two Swiss organizations (ProLutra &amp; Zurich Animal Protection Society) in \n\ncollaboration with the University of Zurich. This project aims to ensure the natural \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nreturn of the Eurasian otter to Switzerland\u2019s subalpine and Alpine valleys. In order to \n\nachieve this, the project was created as a mean to learn the essential requirements for \n\nthis species survival in the Alps, and ultimately to improve habitat in the Swiss river \n\nsystems. PCBs contamination in fishes was appointed as the main factor for the otter \n\npopulations\u2019 decline but this does not quite explain why the species disappeared from \n\npristine river systems in the Swiss Alps region (Weber 1990).  \n\n \n\n \nREFERENCES \n\n \nBaghli, A. &amp; Verhagen, R. 2005.

These structures can have \n\nkey effects on the abundance and distribution of the species and are especially \n\nimportant in certain periods of their biological cycle (e.g. resting and breeding). The \n\nfollowing study took place in the Austrian Alps from May 2010 to January 2011. Four \n\nradio-tracked otters (3 females and 1 male) were followed and data concerning resting \n\nsite choice was registered. During the study, underground structures were used more \n\nfrequently (62%) than above ground sites. Females and females with cubs seem to \n\ndiffer in their use pattern of the different types of resting site. A relation between \n\ntemperature, vegetation cover and width of the river, with the resting site relative \n\npositioning (i.e. above or below ground) was discovered. Data from previous articles \n\nconcerning otter resting sites were analyzed in order to find if there is a geographical \n\ninfluence on rest site choice. Conservation implications for otter re-colonization and \n\nexpansion are discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\nMammals are known to spend a large amount of time being inactive (Elgar et al. 1988), \n\nwithin resting site structures. These structures are known to provide thermoregulatory \n\nadvantages and protection from predators (e.g. Buskirk 1984; Weber 1989; Bakker &amp; \n\nHastings 2002; Lesmeister et al. 2008). Proximity to food resources is also often \n\nshaping the choice of a resting site (Lutermann et al. 2010). Furthermore, resting site \n\npreferences can change with the biological cycle of the animals: for example a breeding \n\nfemale has to select suitable structures which provide safety but also food in its vicinity, \n\nrearing new born cubs while minimizing their mortality (Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2005). It is \n\nalready known that these structures play a central role in mustelid populations (Birks et \n\nal. 2005).  \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nFor otters (Lutra lutra L. 1758), one of the few amphibian mustelids, resting can go up \n\nto 70% of the day (Green et al. 1984; Beja 1996; Saavedra 2002). Otter resting sites\u2019 \n\nhave been studied through the use of radio-telemetry, few with harnesses bearing \n\ntransmitters (Green et al. 1984; Rosoux &amp; Libois 1996) and most with intra-peritoneally \n\nimplanted transmitters (e.g. Melquist &amp; Hornocker 1983; Beja 1996; Saavedra 2002). \n\nThe number of animals followed was never more than four and more females were \n\ntrapped than males (e.g. Kruuk et al. 1998). There is almost no agreement in the \n\ncategories used to classify resting sites, except that all authors grouped them into two \n\nmajor groups: underground dens and surface lairs/couches. \n\nIt was already observed for other species of mustelids that resting site choice is \n\ninfluenced by environmental features. Zalewski (1997) discovered that not only \n\ntemperature influences pine martens rest site choice, but also it reflects a geographical \n\npattern. A similar result was obtained for fishers (Martes pennanti), in which the \n\nindividuals selected subnivean sites when temperatures where below -14\u00baC (Weir et al. \n\n2000). Concerning otter rest site choice, Rosoux &amp; Libois (1996) noticed a relation \n\nbetween type of resting site and populated areas. Couches were associated with less \n\nhumanized sites, while dens were located in places where human disturbance was \n\nstronger. Aside from this, intraspecific pressure can also alter resting site selection; for \n\nexample, Mason &amp; Macdonald (1986) discovered that breeding females may have \n\ntemporary territory dominance over both males and non-breeding females. \n\nThis kind of information on resting sites would not be possible to obtain without radio-\n\ntracking; in fact, chances are that less than 10% of the rest sites were recognized as such \n\n(Green et al. 1984). These structures seem to influence otter distribution and abundance \n\n(Mason &amp; Macdonald 1986), particularly since they play a limiting role in some areas \n\nof this animal\u2019s geographical range (e.g. Beja 1996; Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2005). Since after \n\na generalized European decline the otter is slowly returning to its previous distribution \n\n(Macdonald &amp; Mason 1994), knowing which factors facilitate this re-colonization is a \n\nmajor contribution for conservation in regions where these animals went extinct (like \n\nSwitzerland \u2013 Weber, 1990; or Netherlands \u2013 Kruuk 2006). \n\nIn Austria, where otters are still considered endangered (Conroy &amp; Chanin 2002), \n\npopulation trends indicate a clear increase of numbers (Kranz 1994) as they are favored \n\nby an interconnection with two other populations (Czech Republic\u2019s and Hungary\u2019s) \n\n(Kranz et al. 2001). With the increase of the otter numbers in Austria, mostly in the \n\neastern part of the Alps, the need for ecological studies arises, especially considering \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nthat such studies were never carried out on Alpine river systems. This research was \n\ncarried out under the project Lutra alpina. \n\nThe aim of this study is to characterize otter resting sites on an Alpine environment and \n\ntheir use patterns. Five main hypotheses are tested in this study: 1) Rest-site use pattern \n\ndiffer with sex and breeding status; 2) Above ground structures are favored in isolated \n\nplaces, while underground lairs are used in more human disturbed areas; 3) Snow cover \n\ninfluences the choice of resting site type, with thermal isolated structures being used \n\nmore often; 4) The choice of resting structure can be predicted using environmental \n\nparameters as surrogates 5) Geographic location shapes the use of resting site type \n\ndifferently. The contribution of the results obtained will be discussed in the light of the \n\nsuccessful re-colonization of alpine environments by otters and their long-term \n\nconservation. \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\n \n\nStudy site \n\nThis study took place in two areas in the southeast of Austria, in the state of Styria. The \n\nstudy areas were basically delineated by the home range of the otters being tracked at \n\neach location. This included a valley dominated by the presence of the 24km long river \n\nLaming which encompassed the range of two adult females and the area connecting the \n\ncity of Kapfenberg, the village of Innerzwain the small valley called Hinterberg, \n\nholding the territories of an adult male and a sub-adult female.  \n\nLandscape is dominated by Alpine and subalpine valleys with altitudes ranging from \n\n468 to 1629m (http://www.bruckmur.at/die-stadt/geographie accessed on 29/09/2011). \n\nThe area, as most of Austria, is characterized by an Alpine climate, typically with short \n\nsummers and long winters. Habitat includes coniferous forests (strong presence of \n\nspruce species), mountain mixed forests (in which broadleaf trees are dominant), \n\ngrassland and pastures. Human settlements are present throughout the study area and \n\nmain roads are often quite near the water bodies used by the radio-tracked otters. In all \n\nstudy regions, recreational fishponds are present.  \n\n \n\nOtter trapping and handling \n\nFour otters were captured during two trapping sessions (May and November 2010), one \n\nmale and three females (Table 1). Animals were trapped with soft-catch foot-hold traps \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n(#2 Victor\u00ae Long\u2013Spring\u2013Woodstream Corporation, Lititz, Pennsylvania, USA), fitted \n\nwith trap transmitters. Captured individuals were sedated with Ketamine with \n\nmidazolam, as recommended by previous literature (Spellman et al. 1993 in \u00d3 N\u00e9ill et \n\nal. 2008), being subsequently placed in a transport box and taken to the local veterinary. \n\nThere, after light surgery anaesthesia was induced, the animals underwent surgery in \n\norder to implant the radio transmitter intra-peritoneally. The mortality-sensitive radio \n\ntransmitters (Telonics\u00ae Inc., Mesa, Arizona, USA) use a VHF system, transmitting \n\nfrequencies around 150 mHz. Their size was decided upon capture after weighting the \n\notter so that a maximum of 5% of its body weigh was not exceeded as recommended \n\n(American Society of Mammalogists 1998). A few hours following surgery and after \n\nfully recovering from anaesthesia, animals were released in the surroundings of the \n\ncapture site. \n\nAnimals were classified into three classes according to both age and sex for comparison \n\npurposes: females (Alena &amp; Baujke), females with cubs (Cleo) and males (Dan). One of \n\nthe adult females (Alena) showed signs of breeding during the tracking period, but she \n\nlost the offspring shortly after they were born. It is common, in mammal species, for \n\nyoung females to fail to rear their first litter (Kruuk 2006) and presumably that was the \n\ncase with Alena. Because of this, the breeding period could not be used, preventing her \n\ninclusion in the \u201cfemale with cubs\u201d category. The sub-adult Cleo had an estimated age \n\nof four months, which was based on tooth development and wear, allowing for a \n\ncomparison between breeding and non-breeding females. This is possible since cubs are \n\nknown to stay with the mother until their independency, which happens usually in about \n\none year (Kruuk 2006). \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Number of resting sites (RS) and diurnal locations for each radio-tracked animal \n\n \n\nOtter Sex Age Tracking period \nResting \n\nsites \nDaily \n\nLocations \n\nAlena Female Adult 7.05.2010-30.01.2011* 31 187 \nBaukje Female Adult 6.11.2010-30.01.2011* 5 56 \nCleo Female Sub-adult 09.11.2010-30.01.2011* 13 47 \n\nDan Male Adult 10.10.2010-30.01.2011* 9 54 \n\n   Total 58 344 \n \n\n* Period referred concerns data used in this study; animals continue to be tracked in the frame of the project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nOtter resting sites \n\nIndividuals were regularly positioned by the homing-in method (White &amp; Garrot 1990) \n\nwith a Sika receiver from Biotrack Ltd. (Dorset, UK) and a hand-held H-type aerial. \n\nAnimals were found resting both during night and daytime. However, resting sites \n\nexclusively used during the night were hard to recognize without disturbing the animal \n\nand daylight excursions to the places often did not reveal an obvious structure. For these \n\nreasons, no nocturnal resting sites were used in this approach even though a few were \n\nused. \n\nWhenever an animal was located during daytime and deemed inactive, this place was \n\nconsidered as a diurnal resting site. Tagged individuals were located resting during \n\ndaylight between 47 and 187 days (Table 1). For all animals, the detection rate (number \n\nof days an animal was found by the number of days an animal was searched) of the \n\nresting structures was 92%. For each location the correspondent UTM (Universal \n\nTransverse Mercator) coordinates were taken by a portable GPS device (eTrex H, \n\nGarmin) with less than 10 meters of error. All sites were categorized according to their \n\nstructure and environmental parameters: water-related variables (distance to water, \n\nwidth, depth, current speed and margin type) and surroundings (habitat, distance to \n\nroads and villages, altitude and vegetation height class).  \n\n \n\nMeteorological data \n\nClimate data was obtained from two weather stations, one located in Kapfenberg and \n\nthe other in Aflenz (Fig. 1). The first was used to gather meteorological data for the two \n\nadult females, since their territories were closer to this weather station. The cub and the \n\nmale were usually closer to Aflenz and so, the data from the former station will be used \n\nfor their resting sites. The data obtained included minimum and maximum daily \n\ntemperatures, and also daily precipitation. During this study, temperatures ranged from \n\n34,1 to -16,5 \u00b0C in Kapfenberg and from 31,3 to -20,1 \u00b0C in Aflenz (since May 2010). \n\nPrecipitation was almost non-existent throughout the duration of this study. \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n-20,0\n\n-10,0\n\n0,0\n\n10,0\n\n20,0\n\n30,0\n\n40,0\n\nMay Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan\n\nKapfenberg\n\nAflenz\n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Average daily minimum and maximum temperatures per month and per weather station. \n \n\nData analysis \n\nIn order to assess if the sampling effort was appropriated to determine all the resting \n\nsites used during the tracking period, a resting site discovery cumulative curve was \n\nconstructed for each individual. Preference of the different types of resting sites was \n\ndetermined by the amount of days individuals spent inside each type. Values were \n\nmodified as to represent the proportional use for all individuals (since they differ in the \n\ntotal number of days located) and then compared. Individual rest-site fidelity was \n\nassessed through the re-use index (Zalewski 1997; Baghli &amp; Verhagen 2005), where the \n\nnumber of resting sites found is divided by the number of total diurnal locations.  \n\nIn most cases, the raw data collected did not meet the basic assumptions to allow the \n\nuse of parametric tests. Values transformation did not help to achieve normal \n\ndistribution; as such, only nonparametric tests were used. The software STATISTICA \n\nversion 8.0 (StatSoft Inc. 2007) was used for all non-parametric tests: Wilcoxon \n\nmatched-pairs, Friedman ANOVA, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis (Zar 1999). \n\nIn order to identify patterns in the structure of the resting sites, an ordination method \n\n(non-metric multidimensional scaling \u2013 NMDS) was used. Two types of daytime \n\nresting sites (\u201cReed\u201d and \u201cArtificial structures\u201d) were excluded from the analyses, since \n\nthey lacked sufficient numbers. Hence, only the types \u201cWood pile\u201d, \u201cRoot system\u201d and \n\n\u201cUnderground den\u201d were used in the NDMS. This was repeated for four dimensions (2 \n\nto 5) where stress and R2 values were compared in order to select the best ordination.  \n\nA logistic regression was carried out in order to determine which of the environmental \n\nparameters surrogates best predicted resting site use. Prior to this, non-parametrical \n\n\n\n 15 \n\ncorrelations were used to assess relationships within two groups of variables: \n\nmeteorological variables and variables corresponding to rest sites physical attributes. \n\nThe significance threshold considered for the Spearman correlations was of ? = 0,01 for \n\nboth analysis. Resultantly, ten variables, three continuous and the rest discrete, were \n\ninitially included in the regression. The final model\u2019s accuracy in resting site type \n\nclassification was assessed based on a logistic cut point of 0,5. This value was deemed \n\nappropriate after a ROC curve analysis (Quinn &amp; Keough 2002). \n\nR version 2.13.0 (R Development Core Team 2011) was used for the ordination \n\ntechnique \u2013 package vegan (Oksanen et al. 2011) \u2013, the logistic regression \u2013 package \n\nMASS (Vernables &amp; Ripley 2002), and the ROC curve procedure \u2013 package Epi \n\n(Carstensen et al. 2011). Every statistical test was carried out with ? = 0,05 unless \n\nindicated otherwise. This value was corrected with a Bonferroni adjustment (Quinn &amp; \n\nKeough 2002) when multiple comparisons were needed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n \n\nSample size \n\nAnalyzing the resting site cumulative curve (Fig. 2), it can be assumed that all of the \n\nresting sites used during the study period were identified. This is also supported by a \n\nrest site detection rate of nearly 100%. While there are noticeable oscillations in the \n\ntotal number of new sites at a certain time, these changes are not constant and without \n\nthese oscillations, the curve reaches an asymptote. Since the assumption that all rest \n\nsites used were discovered is met, sample size problems are somewhat reduced; even \n\nwith a small sample and a tracking period that is not ideally long. \n\n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n1 12 23 34 45 56 67 78 89 100 111 122 133 144 155 166 177\n\nNumber of days\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\nR\nS\n\nAlena Baukje Cleo Dan\n \n\nFigure 2 - Cumulative relationship between number of new resting sites and days of radio location \n \n\nResting site description \n\nA total of 58 resting sites were located during the nine months of this preliminary study \n\n(Table 2). Eight of these could not be unequivocally identified and described, and \n\nanother could not be further used in the analysis since it was destroyed. As expected, \n\nthe majority of the daytime rest sites found were not built by the animals, but were \n\nnatural or man-made structures. Wood piles comprised for the largest group of resting \n\nsite type (23 of 50), including both stick and log piles. The second type included root \n\nsystems with 15 sites recorded (Table 2). Other types consisted of underground dens, \n\nartificial structures (an old weir wall and tunnels inside of an industrial complex) and a \n\nreed bed (Phragmites sp.). Resting structures were found in an average of 275 meters \n\n(range: 538-813m) of altitude. Most of them (96%) were not located more than five \n\nmeters away from a water body. Of all considered resting sites, 31 were located in \n\nriverside woodland, while only 20% (n = 10) were in the forest. There was no \n\nrelationship (correlation) between the use of the main types of the resting sites and \n\ndistance to roads and villages. \n\n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nTable 2 - Number and use (locations) of the different types of daytime resting sites per individual  \n\n \n\nRest site use  \n\nOf all the rest sites, 30% were only used once and from these, 57% correspond to \n\nunderground dens. In fact, the majority of all sites (60%) were not occupied more than \n\nfour days (Fig. 3). No differences (Kruskal-Wallis: H = 5,25; P = 0,629) were found \n\nbetween the frequencies of use for the different types of resting sites. For this reason, it \n\ndoes not make sense to compare the characteristics of the reused sites against the sites \n\nonly used once. The male otter used the same resting site for 5 consecutive days, but it \n\nwas one of the females that spent the maximum number of consecutive days (n = 10) \n\ninside the same resting structure. However, consecutive use was rare, as the animals \n\nmoved daily from a resting site to another. Sometimes, this change was just a few \n\nmeters up or down stream.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nType and use of daytime resting site \nAnimal \n\nRoot system Underground den Artificial structures Wood pile Reed \n\nAlena 4 (27) 2 (32) 1 (4) 19 (80) 1 (12) \n\nBaukje 1 (46) 2 (7) 0 1 (2) 0 \n\nCleo 7 (36) 3 (5) 0 2 (2) 0 \n\nDan 3 (28) 2 (12) 1 (4) 1 (4) 0 \n\nTotal 15 (137) 9 (56) 2 (8) 23 (88) 1 (12) \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n \n\nReuse index differed between sex/age classes (Kruskal-Wallis test:  H = 6,46; P = \n\n0,039). A post-hoc test using Mann-Whitney tests showed significant differences \n\nbetween females and females with cubs (Z = 2,22; P = 0,026). However, the threshold \n\nfor significance with a Bonferroni adjustment is slightly lower (? = 0,016) altering the \n\np-value obtained to non significant. The reuse index for the male did not show \n\ndifferences from both classes of females. Moreover, presence of snow cover does not \n\nappear to influence the reuse of the rest sites differently (Wilcoxon matched pairs test: \n\nZ = 0,18; P = 0,859), although, underground rest sites seemed to be used more often \n\nthan above ground ones when snow cover was present. \n\n \n\nResting site choice \n\nThere was a difference found for the site choice (Friedman ANOVA:  ?4\n4= 12,52; P = \n\n0,013). However, upon the use of post-hoc tests, no significant values were found, even \n\nbefore Bonferroni adjustments (with P = 0,067). While it was not possible to \n\nstatistically assess this, root systems were used considerably more than the rest of the \n\nresting site types (recall Table 2). Reed beds and artificial structures comprise for the \n\nless used rest sites suggesting these types as the least preferred. \n\n \n\nStructural patterns and predictive power of environmental surrogates \n\nA good adjustment quality of 0,06, according to Krukal\u2019s scale (Kruskal 1964 in Pereira \n\n1999) was obtained for the NMDS. Also, two dimensions proved sufficient to explain \n\n99% of the variation found.

This is supported by the high significance of the \n\nvariable concerning resting site type. Additionally, the significant variables responsible \n\nfor the variation were: type of resting site, altitude, vegetation class, distance to village, \n\nhabitat, width of the river and margin type.  \n\nWhen From the first group, maximum temperatures were significantly correlated with \n\nprecipitation, and since there was almost no rain during this study, rainfall was removed \n\nfrom further analysis. In the second group, two variables were significantly correlated \n\nwith two other (distance to water with flow velocity and distance to villages with \n\nmargin types). Distance to water was included, since otters depend on water availability \n\n(Prenda et al. 2001) and so, flow velocity was rejected for being less relevant, although \n\nthat in some conditions it can be related to hunting success. In agreement with Rosoux \n\n&amp; Libois (1996), the distance to villages is a more appropriate parameter to determine \n\nrest site type and as such, margin type was discarded. \n\nThe model was shortened by six variables after a backward stepwise procedure (Table \n\n3). Wald\u2019s chi-square statistics calculated the contribution each of the four variables to \n\nthe final model. No significant differences were found between the ten variable model \n\nand the four variable one. Vegetation height class, width of the water course and \n\nmaximum temperature were the variables contributing significantly to explain rest-site \n\nselection (Table 3). Since distance to water was included in the final model but it was \n\nnot significant, a model without this variable and the four variable one were compared \n\nand as the result was highly significant (P &lt;0,00001) it was decided to maintain this \n\nvariable. Maximum temperature seems to weight more on the choice of resting site \n\ntype; higher temperatures will increase the probability of choosing a resting site above \n\nground. In a similar way, the existence of trees (the highest class of vegetation) \n\nincreases the chance of an individual choosing an underground structure. The overall \n\naccuracy of the model was about 93,47%, enhanced by the AUC (area under the curve) \n\nof 0,953 obtained in the ROC curve analysis. According to Swets (1988 in Manel et al. \n\n2001), a AUC value above 0,9 denotes high accuracy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nTable 3 - Environmental parameters contributing to the prediction of resting site type as determined by \n\nlogistic regression \n\nParameter ?

This is \n\nthe case of this study where only four otters were tracked for a limited and variable time \n\nperiod. All the four otters are still being followed in the frame of the project and results \n\ngathered will complement these preliminary data and allow more robust analyses and \n\ndata interpretations. \n\nOtters are really hard animals to trap, which can be perceived by the low numbers of \n\nanimals used in radio-tracking studies (e.g. Rosoux &amp; Libois 1996; Kruuk et al. 1998), \n\nthis study included. Three of the animals were tracked for relatively small periods of \n\ntime, comparing to the female followed since May 2010. This might cause a \n\nmisrepresentation of the relations between the animals and their resting site use/choice. \n\nSince the animals were not searched for every day, some resting sites may have been \n\nmore consecutively used than what was observed. However, given the amount of daily \n\nchanges of resting site, this should not change much the overall scenario. Moreover, as \n\nsmall as the sample is, daytime resting site discovery curve along with a nearly 100% \n\ndetection rate, informs us that approximately all the rest sites used during the tracking \n\nperiod were discovered.  \n\nRelative to statistical constraints, aside from the ones deriving from sample size, there is \n\nalways the small possibility that some correlations will be due to chance and not due to \n\na real association linking variables. This could be the case in the correlation between \n\nflow velocity and distance to water, for example. It was decided to use Bonferroni \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nadjustments in order to obtain solid statistical results, even in the presence of a small \n\nsample. \n\n \n\nDoes the rest site use pattern differ with sex and breeding status? \n\nDaily change of resting site was observed when consecutive radio locations took place. \n\nThis tendency is consistent with findings from literature concerning Lutra lutra sleeping \n\nbehavior (e.g. Green et al. 1984; Rosoux &amp; Libois 1996; Saavedra 2002) where \n\nfrequent changes of resting site occur. While this pattern has been noted repeatedly, no \n\nhypotheses have been brought forward for otters. It has been proposed for other species \n\nthat this kind of behavior could be an avoiding parasites strategy (Kowalewski &amp; \n\nZunino 2005). This hypothesis can be put aside as otters may return to the same resting \n\nsite with only one day interval. Zabala et al. (2003) suggests that animals that do not \n\nspend energy building their resting structures, tend to use a higher number of such \n\nplaces and in addition, to be less faithful to them. This seems more suitable considering \n\notter behavior. As it was said previously, otters tend to occupy already existing \n\nstructures rather than building their own. This is even more evident in habitats where \n\nnatural/artificial rest site structures are highly available. A larger range of resting site \n\noptions, i.e. higher availability, will lead to a lower fidelity to those same sites. On the \n\nother hand, habitats where resting sites are a limited resource, as in coastal areas (Beja \n\n1996), the reuse index will clearly be higher. This is when food availability is high, \n\notherwise, even if there are many accessible rest sites, animals will tend to select those \n\nin close proximity with food resources, increasing the fidelity of those same sites. \n\nRe-use index differed between females and breeding females. The presence of a litter \n\nhas already been described to alter habitat use (Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2005) in comparison \n\nwith single otters. However, these associations lost significance after a Bonferroni \n\nadjustment, inferring a relationship that may be validated by a larger study, considering \n\nthat this result was obtained for a small sample already divided into sex and age classes. \n\nThe results obtained for rest site choice were statistically inconclusive; the Friedman \n\nANOVA found the global set to be significantly different, but a closer analysis with \n\npost-hoc tests showed no relevant results. While this could be explained by the lower \n\nstatistical power of the non-parametric tests, it is probably also be due to the effects of a \n\nsmall sample size. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nIs human presence an influence on daytime resting site choice? \n\nIn contrast with the findings of Rosoux &amp; Libois 1996, where couches were associated \n\nwith areas less accessible to people and dens with humanized areas, no such relation \n\nwas found in the present study. In fact, one of the animals was located sleeping just \n\nopposite to a parking lot quite busy with hikers talking loudly. The same animal only \n\nmoved to another resting site upon the close presence of a dog in one time and of a \n\nbulldozer in another. With these exceptions, when one animal went to sleep, it did not \n\nchange its location until the next sunset. This is not new (e.g. Green et al. 1984; Mason \n\n&amp; Macdonald 1986; L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00edn et al. 1998; Durbin et al. 1998; Ruiz-Olmo et al. \n\n2005): otters do not seem to be bothered by indirect human disturbance when they are \n\nresting, even when this disturbance is close. Such behavior is not exclusive of this otter \n\nspecies, it has been observed also in Lutra perspicillata (Anoop &amp; Hussain 2004) and in \n\nLutra canadensis (Melquist &amp; Hornocker 1983). Some authors suggest this response is \n\nassociated with a higher availability of rest sites (Prenda et al. 2001) and of food \n\n(Melquist &amp; Hornocker 1983). Bedford (2009) relates this behavior with urban \n\nexpansion, which might have forced otters to become more tolerant. The choice of \n\nresting site seems to be independent of the distance to both roads and villages, thus \n\nrejecting the initial hypothesis concerning the choice of above or below ground \n\nstructures in relation to disturbance proximity. However, the population density in the \n\nstudy area might not show enough variation to affect rest site location or maybe these \n\nhighly populated areas are simply less used. Both these reasons can account for the \n\ninexistence of a relation between rest site location and human presence. \n\n \n\nDoes snow cover differently favor the use of certain resting sites? \n\nThere was no distinction found between the re-use index of the different types of resting \n\nsite without and with snow cover. Whilst this could be related to the highly efficient \n\nthermal insulation of otter fur (Weisel et al. 2005), it is more likely associated to the \n\nperiod when three of the animals were captured. These three only began to be followed \n\nin the first days of November, while snow cover settled by the 26th of the same month. \n\nAir temperature was already dropping since October, which may have resulted in an \n\napparent lack of difference when snow cover was present. Consequently, it can not be \n\nconsidered that snow influences or not the choice of certain types of resting sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nWhich environmental parameters surrogates best predict rest site choice? \n\nThe logistic regression results suggest that vegetation cover, width of the river system \n\nand maximum temperature (Table 3) are the most relevant characteristics associated \n\nwith a specific type of structure. Although some authors say vegetation cover is not \n\nassociated with otter distribution (Kruuk et al. 1998), many authors classified this \n\nfeature as an essential requirement in otter habitat (e.g. Ottino &amp; Giller 2004; Bedford \n\n2009). In fact, it has been shown that otters avoid areas without vegetation cover \n\n(Mason 1995; Cho et al. 2009). The coefficient obtained for this variable in the logistic \n\nregression point to a relation between the absence of trees and the use of above ground \n\nstructures. Since resting sites made of root systems are more common than underground \n\nsites without any trees, this result is also understandable concerning the role of resting \n\nsite provider that trees have.  \n\nVariation in use patterns caused by weather conditions has already been described for \n\nmustelids (e.g. Wilbert et al., 2000; Weir et al., 2004; Kowalczyk et al. 2004). The \n\nresults obtained in the logistic regression, suggest temperature is related to rest site \n\nlocation, i.e. above or below ground, as it is the case with pine martens (Zalewski \n\n1997). When temperatures decrease, there is a higher probability that otters will use \n\nresting structures below ground and the same is true for the opposite. This tendency \n\nmakes sense when thermoregulation needs are taken into account, especially when \n\nconsidering the isolation properties of otter fur. \n\nRiver width plays an important role concerning feeding and cub rearing (Ruiz-Olmo et \n\nal. 2005) and Cho et al. (2009) found that otters tend to occupy low-order streams. It is \n\nnot clear why a larger river width is associated with underground rest sites, unless it is a \n\nresult of width relation to depth. In general, wider rivers tend to be also deeper and it is \n\nmore functional to build an underground den with an underwater entrance when rivers \n\nhave more depth. In summary, above ground structures seem to be chosen more often \n\nwith higher temperatures, lower vegetation height (fewer trees) and smaller river \n\nwidths. \n\nDistance to the nearest water body was included in the final model even though its lack \n\nof statistical significance. Moreover, when a model without this variable was compared \n\nto the final model, there was a highly significant result, which justifies its inclusion in \n\nthe final model. This might be due to an interaction between variables, as in distance to \n\nwater not being related more to above or below ground structures but being related to \n\nboth instead. \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n \n\nIs there a geographical-related resting site use pattern in Europe? \n\nIn spite of the high number of otter studies in Europe, only a small fraction (n=5) \n\nconsidered resting site use. Time-span of such studies was highly variable (38 to 179 \n\nmean locations per individual) and there seems to be an arbitrary bias towards females \n\n(Table 4). As a result, the data gathered from available literature concerns only 5 males \n\nout of 18 otters.  \n\nCosta Vicentina (Portugal) was the region with a lower mean number of resting sites \n\nper individual (i.e. number of resting sites divided by the number of animals tracked),  \n\ncounting only 3,67 rest sites per animal. However, this study (Beja 1996), analyzed \n\nexclusively coastal otters and as such, it can not be directly comparable with the \n\nremaining, which were located in freshwater systems. The otters in Bohemia \n\n(Austria/Czech Republic) had a higher number of resting sites per individual (n=82), \n\ncompared to the other studies. Kranz (1995) relates this with the migratory behavior of \n\none of the otters.   \n\n \nTable 4 - Rest site use frequency of use, total locations, number of resting sites, number of animals \ntracked, mean number of resting sites per animal and mean locations per animal in 6 localities in Europe. \n\n \n*Beja (1996) only shows data for the coastal otters, even though he caught a forth animal from an \nestuarine environment. \n1 Beja 1996; 2 Rosoux &amp; Libois 1996; 3 Green et al. 1984; 4 Kruuk et al. 1998; 5 Kranz 1995 and 6 the \npresent study. \n \n\nFrequency of use is perhaps the best way to analyze this data, since it is possible to \n\ntransform and compare it in the same unit (percentage) for all studies. Percentage of use \n\nof both main types of rest site is quite similar between the two radio-telemetry studies in \n\nScotland and this suggests an existing geographically related pattern, given that \n\nproximity implies a somewhat identical habitat. However, rest site use does not seem to \n\nbe related to any factors gradually changing with geographical coordinates.

On the other hand, a \n\nlatitudinal pattern can also be excluded, because the transitional stage (each type being \n\nused similarly) only happens in the northernmost study area, whereas it should happen \n\nin between. An altitude related pattern can also be excluded since two study areas \n\n(Marais Poitevin and the present study) with fairly different altitudes, present similar \n\nresults. In fact, altitudinal gradient has been described as \u201cpoor indicator of otter \n\npresence\u201d (Robitaille &amp; Laurence 2002).  \n\nWhile temperature can indeed shape the rest site choice, as Zalewski (1997), for pine \n\nmartens, and this study demonstrated, other factor(s) must be acting as well. It could be \n\nrelated to the dominant type of vegetation, which provides resources for both main \n\ntypes of rest-structures (wood and roots). However, all of this is of subjective and hard \n\ninterpretation, since there is a large spatial dispersion and heterogeneity between data. \n\nThis is especially true when considering that males and females might have different \n\nuse patterns as Green et al. (1984) observed in their study. More studies are needed if \n\nthe geographical use pattern is to be better understood. \n\n \n\nConservation implications \n\nBeing root systems used more often than any other type of resting site, it can be \n\nconsidered that these structures can only be a limiting factor, in Alpine river systems, \n\nwhen tree density is very low. This was not the case, since Styria is the most forested \n\ndistrict of Austria. As long as thermoregulation needs are met and vegetation cover is \n\npresent, there seems to be no obstacle to otter re-colonization of Styria, considering that \n\nfood is available. However it must be investigated if there are different limiting factors \n\nin the remaining areas of Austria that might hinder otter return. As evidences for \n\nexpansion and re-colonization accumulate in other countries, hope is now renewed for \n\nthe same to happen in countries where the otter went extinct, like Switzerland.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nSpecial thanks to Addy de Jongh and to Tjibee Jong for the precious help trapping and \n\nhandling radio-tracked otters.

In \n\nEurope, it is exceptionally hard to carry out any kind of research that requires the capture \n\nof individuals necessary for radio-telemetry. Because of its conservation status, otters \n\nare fully protected; often, legislations associated with this causes difficulties to \n\nresearchers, slowing scientific progress.  \n\nFor future studies, it would be interesting to further explore the geographical pattern of \n\nresting site use. Several European areas are lacking this kind of data, especially northern \n\n(e.g. Scandinavian Peninsula) and southern zones (e.g. Italy). Data from these regions \n\nmight contribute enormously to discover which features are responsible for variation in \n\nuse patterns. Also, the way this topic is approached, needs to be reassessed. Generally, \n\nthere is not an interconnection of areas; either it is diet or habitat related questions. Food \n\navailability can change the way otters use their available resting sites. Furthermore, it \n\ncan be altering or enhancing other environmental variables, masking a geographical \n\npattern, e.g. areas with higher food availability might have versus areas with less food \n\nresources. This kind of knowledge would bring insight on the specific needs that this \n\ncarnivore has, concerning resting and denning behavior. This is essential in order to \n\nbetter understand species-habitat relationship, ultimately strengthening conservation \n\ndecisions.  \n\n \n \n\n1. na discuss\u00e3o n\u00e3o retomas nem discutes as hip\u00f3teses que falaste na \nintrodu\u00e7\u00e3o do paper e isso tem de ser feito de forma clara, i.e. \ndizendo se os teus dados suportam ou rejeitam as hip\u00f3teses \n2. na estrutura de trabalho seleccionada para al\u00e9m da discuss\u00e3o no \npaper propriamente dito tens de fazer uma discuss\u00e3o global.
