Os plasm\u00eddeos com gama alargada de hospedeiros (BHR), \nrespons\u00e1veis pelo fluxo de material gen\u00e9tico entre cromossomas bacterianos \n(inclusivamente entre microorganismos muito afastados filogeneticamente) t\u00eam \num papel essencial na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades microbianas. Entre eles, os \nplasm\u00eddeos pertencendo ao grupo de incompatibilidade IncP-1 t\u00eam um \ninteresse especial por causa da sua extraordin\u00e1ria flexibilidade na inicia\u00e7\u00e3o da \nreplica\u00e7\u00e3o e da estabilidade na sua manuten\u00e7\u00e3o numa ampla gama de \nhospedeiros.

Os \nsete plasm\u00eddeos IncP-1 detectados, foram em primeiro lugarfilogeneticamente \nestudados. O alinhamento das sequ\u00eancias de nucle\u00f3tidos de 281 pb que foram \namplificadas e que correspondem a um fragmento do gene trfA (que codifica \npara uma prote\u00edna do in\u00edcio da replica\u00e7ao) sugeriu o estabelecimento de dois \nnovos clusters situados filogeneticamente em dois subgrupos diferentes de \nIncP-1: IncP-1? e o recentemente descrito IncP-1?.

Broad host range plasmids, \nresponsible for the reshuffling of genetic material between bacterial \nchromosomes (even amongst distantly related microorganims), play an \nessential role on the evolution and diversity of microbial communities. Among \nthem, the incompatibility group IncP-1 plasmids have a special interest due to \ntheir extraordinary flexibility in the replication initiation and stable maintenance \nin such a wide spectrum of hosts. These mobile genetic elements, in addition to \nthe helpful genetic engineering tools they mean, represent a great source of \npotentially useful genes encoding for traits as significant as antibiotic resistance \nor xenobiotic degradation. Nevertheless, the diversity of this family of BHR \nplasmids has been underestimated until recently: it is currently known to have \nfive divergent sub-groups, but although some prototype plasmids have been \nstudied in great detail, there is still much left to research.  \nIn previous investigations exogenous plasmid capture was carried out as well \nas putative endogenous plasmid bacterial hosts isolated in the Ria de Aveiro \nlagoon (NW coast of Portugal). In this work, polymerase chain reactions were \ndeveloped to amplify specific nucleotide sequences and determine BHR \nplasmids presence. From a bioinformatical approach, the seven IncP-1 \nplasmids detected were firstly phylogenetically studied. The alignment of the \namplified 281 bp nucleotide sequences corresponding to a fragment of the \nreplication initiation protein encoding gene trfA suggested the formation of two \nnovel clusters belonging to two different IncP-1 plasmid subgroups: IncP-1? \nand the lately described IncP-1?. Additionally, these represent the first \nestuarine IncP-1 replicons to be detected and isolated. Then a preliminary \ngenetic and phenotypic comparison was performed with the purified plasmids, \nby taking into account the known description of the evolutionary closest \nmodels, pB10 and pKJK5. That way, restriction fragment analysis as well as \nantibiotic and mercury resistance determination assays helped to comprehend \nthe high significance falling on the captured plasmids by revealing the genetic \nand phenotypic diversity. A whole description of any of these novel plasmids \nmay have a huge ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological importance, \neven more due to its precedence from a non-clinical environment. Therefore \nthis work justifies further studies on these promiscuous replicons. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nContents: \n\nIndex of tables ................................................................................................................... 3 \n\nIndex of figures .................................................................................................................. 4 \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1 Aquatic environments and microbial communities \n\nThe specific physical habitat or location of a microorganism is its \n\nmicroenvironment. There, the fluxes and gradients of required oxidants, reductants, and \n\nnutrients as well as waste products create a unique niche. However, the microorganisms \n\ncan create their own microenvironments and niches. When microbial growth happens on \n\nsurfaces, such as in freshwater and marine environments, biofilms are formed (Prescott et \n\nal., 2002b). \n\nThe physical frontier between the ocean and the atmosphere is the sea-surface \n\nmicrolayer (SML). This interface between the sea and the air is considered to be the \n\naround 1mm-top layer of the ocean (the layer of 10-100 \u00b5m-top was employed in this \n\nresearch). If compared with subsurface water (SSW) it is physical-chemically distinct and \n\ncharacteristically enriched with biogenic organic compounds, such as lipids, proteins and \n\npolysaccharides. That stratification makes the SML stable enough to exist at typical \n\noceanic wind conditions (Wurl et al., 2009). The main point is that the SML could be made \n\nup of gel particles, with similar microbiological and biogeochemical characteristics. Some \n\nstudies showed an enrichment of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in the SML (Wurl \n\net al. 2008). TEPs are normally formed in surface waters from the coagulation of biogenic \n\npolysaccharides; chiefly those produced by phytoplankton, and are some of the most \n\nubiquitous gel particles in the marine environment. They are critical in the formation of \n\nmarine aggregates, acting as the binding matrix or \u2018glue\u2019 that holds the aggregate together \n\n(Verdugo et al., 2004).  \n\nThe presence of the surface film and surface tension properties turn the SML into a \n\nunique habitat. Bacterial communities that are present in the SML are known as the \n\nbacterioneuston. Surface films also take place on all water bodies, marine, estuarine and \n\nfreshwater, sometimes as visible slicks. The microbial communities established in the \n\nSSW are less dense and less structured, and constitute what is called the bacterioplancton \n\n(Cunliffe et al., 2009a). \n\nThe aggregation of bacterial cells seen in some studies (Franklin et al., 2005; \n\nCunliffe et al., 2009a) most likely takes place in the SML, with bacterial cells attached to \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nthe TEP-based gel particles reported by Wurl and Holmes (2008). It has been proposed \n\nthat this enrichment on attached biofilm-growing cells is the main cause of the distinct \n\nproperties of bacterioneuston. If, as suggested by Sieburth (1983), the SML is a gelatinous \n\nfilm in which prevails biofilm-growing cells, then biological processes that occur in bacterial \n\ncommunities and that are favored when bacterial cells are in close proximity, such as \n\nhorizontal gene transfer (HGT) and quorum sensing, could be more frequent. The large \n\nspecific microbiological diversity supposed to occur in this unique ecological niche \n\nsupports a much broader molecular and functional diversities. Therefore, its subsequently \n\npossible biotechnological value makes its investigation interesting. Nonetheless, studies \n\nconcerning the molecular microbial ecology of the SML started only recently (Cunliffe et \n\nal., 2009a). \n\n \n\n1.2 Bacterial plasmids and their importance in shaping the properties of \n\nbacterial communities. \n\nNowadays there is evidence that plasmids and transposable elements can move \n\ngenetic material between bacterial chromosomes to cause rapid changes in genomes and \n\ndrastically alter phenotypes (Prescott et al., 2002a). The prokaryotic horizontal gene pool \n\n(HGP), defined as the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their encoded genes \n\n(Thomas, 2000b), plays a vital and essential role in the evolution and adaptation of \n\nindividual microorganisms and microbial communities by generating genetic variations in \n\nbacteria (reviewed in Arber, 2000). Like that, the sequencing of complete bacterial \n\ngenomes has clearly shown that a large proportion of their genetic diversity have been \n\nacquired by HGT and come from distantly related microorganisms. This evidence has \n\nbeen derived from nucleotide sequence comparisons as well as from atypical nucleotide \n\ncomposition (guanine + cytosine content) of large genomic regions or different patterns of \n\ncodon usage of some genes (Ochman et al., 2000). \n\nHuge efforts have been carried out to catalogue, characterize, and exploit the \n\ndifferent aspects of the enormous biodiversity of microorganisms in every natural habitat. \n\nIn contrast, there is an undeveloped understanding of the abundance, distribution and \n\nmolecular diversity of MGEs extant in the HGP occurring in most marine, freshwater, and \n\nmany terrestrial microbial communities (Sobecky, 2002). Probably that is due to the fact \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nthat the importance of the HGT in bacterial persistence, diversity and evolution is less \n\nwidely appreciated (Thomas, 2000b). The first time its significance was accepted match up \n\nwith the moment when multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens emerged, since MGE played \n\na primary role in the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and \n\nallowed bacterial populations to rapidly adapt to a strong selective pressure. Additionally, \n\nplasmid mediated conjugation is probably one of the most frequent mechanisms of HGT \n\n(Sota et al., 2008), which explain the particular interest falling on this kind of MGE. \n\nBecause of this reshuffling of genes between bacterial cells, populations and \n\ncommunities that makes plasmids remarkably influent in ecological processes, the study of \n\nplasmid ecology and transfer together with environmental microbiology and microbial \n\necology can provide essential information on plasmid evolution. The evolutionary change \n\naffects plasmids in the same way as their host bacteria so plasmids have been regarded \n\nas units of evolution. In addition, retrospective studies offer a means to infer evolutionary \n\nrelationships directly from plasmids isolated from geographically similar or remote \n\nlocations (Sobecky, 2002; Pickup et al., 1996). \n\nThus, since plasmids represent a large genetic resource of bacterial diversity, \n\nresearch on plasmid distribution, evolutionary relationships, and diversity of plasmids in \n\nrelation to the natural selection pressures is required in order to comprehend the role they \n\nplay in the flow of genetic information in natural bacterial communities (Dahlberg et al., \n\n1997; Harada et al., 2006). \n\nFurthermore, the HGT is also manifested in the \u201cplasmids backbones\u201d where \n\nrecombination within homologous regions of closely related plasmids can be noticed. \n\nSince these regions are responsible for replication, maintenance, and plasmid transfer, \n\nthese recombination events play a key role in increasing or reducing the host range of \n\nthese plasmids. This could be imperative as much with regard to the species which could \n\nobtain new genetic traits as because it sets the genetic backgrounds from which plasmids \n\ncan purchase new traits (Lipps et al., 2008). \n\nMost of the actual knowledge of HGT is related to plasmids occurring in bacteria of \n\nmedical and agricultural importance. These plasmids correspond to a limited collection of \n\nreplicons that surely are not representative of the plasmid populations occurring in every \n\nenvironment.  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nSeveral plasmid types present in strains isolated from clinical environments can be \n\nalso found in environmental samples such as manure slurries or marine sediments; \n\nhowever a large part of the plasmids isolated from bacterial strains of natural environments \n\ncontain replication and incompatibility regions unrelated to those of the known groups of \n\nplasmids traditionally found associated to clinical environments. This justifies further \n\nevaluation of the prevalence, diversity and evolution of plasmids, especially in nonclinical \n\nenvironments (Thomas, 2000b; Sobecky, 2002; Gstalder et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n1.3 The study of plasmids and its biotechnological significance \n\nA vast pool of traits usually associated with plasmids rather than chromosomes \n\nconfer advantages which allow bacterial communities to evolve, adapt to selective \n\npressure and colonize certain habitats. Some examples of those traits are mentioned in \n\nthe table I (Thomas, 2000b). These kind of habitats, among which a representative case is \n\nthe SML, due to their extreme characteristics or to the way they bring diverse bacterial \n\nspecies together, may represent a good source of new plasmids or of old plasmid \n\nskeletons carrying new recombined segments. Ecological studies that contribute to a \n\ndeeper knowledge on the distribution of different types of plasmids and their hosts are \n\nimportant in defining which environments are better to exploit, avoiding the inconvenient of \n\nblind extensive screenings. \n\nThe emergence of large multidrug resistance plasmids due to the strong selective \n\npressure caused by antimicrobial chemotherapy is threatening to reverse development in \n\nthe treatment of infectious diseases by augmenting human pathogens resistance to \n\nantimicrobial agents (Tauch et al., 2003; Tennstedt et al., 2005; Schl\u00fcter et al., 2007). \n\nNevertheless, in addition to the clearly imperative significance of increasing the knowledge \n\nabout resistance genes to clinically relevant antimicrobial drugs, there is also a huge \n\ninterest in further study other kinds of functions carried by plasmids. \n\nA large number of the xenobiotics that have been introduced to the environment at \n\nmodern society are recalcitrant. Catabolic plasmids and their host strains have an \n\nenormous environmental and ecological significance due to their potential application for \n\nenvironmental biotechnology. Different catabolic pathways may be either chromosomally \n\nor plasmid-encoded (Sayler et al., 1990). However, ecologically, plasmid-encoded \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\npathways are beneficial because they provide genetically flexible systems and can be \n\nmaintained in the population and transferred between bacterial species, without the need \n\nof technological support. \n\nIn addition to the genes that encode the degradation of man-made organic \n\ncompounds, those responsible for the metabolism of naturally occurring pollutants are also \n\nassumed to be often located on plasmids or other mobile elements (Top et al., 2002).  \n\nBesides, since some accessory genes on these plasmids have no homologues and \n\ncannot be assigned a function, it is not known yet what phenotypes other than the well-\n\nknown resistance and degradation functions may be encoded by certain plasmids (Sen et \n\nal., 2010). In this context, plasmids seem to be an extraordinary reservoir of molecular \n\ndeterminants of diverse functions and the technological potential of this reservoir deserves \n\nto be exploited. \n\nOtherwise, plasmids are powerful vectors of recombinant DNA, allowing its spread \n\nin the environment. Its biotechnological importance in this respect lies in its utility as \n\ncloning vectors or vehicles of protein expression in different bacterial hosts. A complete \n\nknowledge of the distribution, maintenance, recombination, and conjugation of BHR \n\nplasmids is consequently essential to evaluate the risk associated with the release of \n\nrecombinant DNA into the environment (Dr\u00f6nen et al., 1998; Gstalder et al., 2003). \n\nAs a conclusion it could be stated that plasmids may have increasingly important \n\nbiotechnological applications, both respect to the large source of novel traits MGE \n\nrepresent and as useful tools in genetic engineering.  Anyway, the first step in researching \n\nthese potential utilities, as referred before, is further studying plasmid characterization, \n\ndiversity and evolution. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable I.Examples of traits usually associated with plasmids. \n\nPhenotype encoded Plasmid example References\n\nresistance to antibiotics pKJK5 Bahl et al.

Schematical structures of IncP-1 and IncQ plasmids. The white area represents the \n\nregions for plasmid replication and control; the grey one, those genes involved in plasmid \n\ntransfer (or mobilization); black symbolize the accessory genes (Lipps, 2008). \n\nmaintenance and control of the plasmid; and the \u2018\u2018accessory\u201d region consisting of genes \n\nthat may confer specific beneficial traits to the bacterial host (Thomas, 2000a).  \n\nIn any case, plasmids are not at all static genomes, but instead are plastic genetic \n\nmosaics that have evolved over time through the iterative acquisition of various \n\ntransposons, integrons, gene cassettes, genomic islands and insertion sequences, which \n\nare almost always associated with accessory genes, placing them in one or two sites \n\nbetween essential DNA fragments i.e., between oriV (the origin of vegetative replication), \n\nand trfA (a  gene for plasmid replication) and/or between the two transfer operons that \n\nencode mating-pair formation and plasmid transfer trb and tra. Plasmids with almost \n\nidentical backbones can have entirely different accessory genes (Lipps et al., 2008; Sen et \n\nal., 2010; Schl\u00fcter et al., 2007). Another essential gene that should be named is oriT, the \n\norigin of plasmid transfer. Mob proteins in mobilizable plasmids are necessary to convert \n\nthe plasmids into the transferable form. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, plasmids without such functional elements, these accessory elements, \n\nhave also been described (Kamachi et al., 2006). \n\nIn other respects, plasmids are known to have complex recombinational histories. \n\nSome survival functions depend on just one genetic locus, but most depend on at least \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\ntwo. The first sorts of modules to emerge would probably have consisted of interdependent \n\nfunctions but, at the same time, independent but mutually beneficial functions probably \n\nbecame clustered, as reviewed in Thomas (2000a). \n\n1.4.2 Incompatibility groups and BHR plasmids. \n\nPlasmid classification has been originally based in a property inherent in them, \n\nwhich is in addition a manifestation of relatedness (since it is the sharing of common \n\nelements related to plasmid control of replication and partition). Incompatibility is the \n\ninability of two plasmids to be maintained stably in the same cell line (Couturier et al., \n\n1988). Two plasmids which cannot stay in the same cell belong to the same incompatibility \n\ngroup. \n\nFour of these incompatibility groups are considered to be broad-host-range (BHR) \n\nplasmids. In spite of the difficulty of determining the host range of a plasmid, as transfer \n\ncan be tested experimentally only between hosts representing a minute fraction of the \n\nbacterial world, Szpirer and co-workers (1999) proposed, in an attempt to define BHR, that \n\nplasmids which can transfer and replicate in bacterial species from at least two branches \n\nof the Proteobacteria should be viewed as BHR plasmids. Then the conjugative IncP, IncN \n\nand IncW, plasmids and the mobilizable IncQ plasmids are regarded as having BHR \n\n(Gstalder et al., 2003).  \n\nThe role of BHR plasmids is remarkable when speaking about interspecies gene \n\nexchange since they are most likely the single intermediaries of HGT between distantly \n\nrelated bacterial hosts. IncQ plasmids have the broadest host-range of all of them in gram \n\nnegative bacteria, followed of those of the group IncP-1 (based in the Pseudomonas \n\nclassification system). Apart from spreading genes across taxonomically distant species by \n\nconjugative transfer, BHR plasmids can partially integrate into the recipient chromosome, \n\nor mobilize non-conjugative vectors with a wider host range (Lipps, 2008). They can also \n\nretromobilize or retrotransfer i.e., capturing genes or non-self-transmissible plasmids from \n\nhost in which they cannot replicate (Szpirer et al., 1999). All these reasons make research \n\nabout BHR plasmids especially interesting. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n1.5 The group of IncP-1 plasmids \n\nThe distinctive characteristic of low copy number plasmids belonging to the \n\nincompatibility group IncP-1 is the central control operon coding for at least three global \n\nregulators. It gives them flexibility in the replication initiation, multiple stability mechanisms \n\nand coordinates regulation of all plasmid backbone functions, providing them with \n\nenormous adaptability and stable maintenance in such a wide spectrum of hosts. This \n\nability of replicating and being stably maintained in almost all Gram-negative bacteria as \n\nwell as being transferred by conjugation to Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and eukaryotic \n\ncell lines justifies the particular interest that fall on IncP-1 plasmids (Adamczyk et al., 2003; \n\nWaters, 2001; Harada et al., 2006). \n\nIn spite of the high infection transfer rates the IncP-1 plasmids have, horizontal \n\ntransfer is not enough for them to be maintained as genetic parasites, as they are a \n\nburden to their host, so that they need to carry at least occasionally advantageous traits to \n\nbe maintained in bacterial communities. Consequently, the majority of the IncP-1 plasmids \n\nhave large regions with acquired genes encoding traits which occasionally might augment \n\nthe fitness of the bacterial host (Bergstrom et al., 2000). \n\nIt appears that the IncP-1 backbone can either carry antibiotic-resistance \n\ndeterminants or degradative operons but to the best of our knowledge, a plasmid that \n\ncarries both types of genes (antibiotic-resistance and degradative genes) has not yet been \n\nidentified (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2003). \n\nRegardless of the large range of accessory elements among IncP-1 plasmids, they \n\nmay be phylogenetically grouped into a small number of distinct subgroups based on their \n\nbackbone sequences. As a result, during the last years, phylogenetic analysis of the \n\n281bp-region of the replication gene trfA, as well as a few other essential backbone genes \n\nregions, has allowed the IncP-1 plasmid group to be classified into five main phylogenetic \n\nsub-groups: IncP-1?, -?, -?, -? and -? (Sen et al., 2010; Bahl et al., 2009).  \n\nThe ? and ? subgroups constitute the two first recognized subgroups and have \n\nbeen extensively studied. The ? and ? subgroups were defined only based on a \n\nphylogenetic analysis of their backbone genes. Later, three IncP-1 ? and one IncP-1 ? \n\nplasmids were completely sequenced and described (Xia et al., 1998; Vedler et al., 2004; \n\nSen et al., 2010; Hill et al., 1992). The presence of a fifth subgroup, ?, was recently \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nsuggested by Bahl (2007) consisting of pEMT3 (from which just a fragment is known) and \n\npKJK5 that has been completely sequenced (Gstalder et al., 2003; Top et al., 1995; Bahl \n\net al., 2007).  \n\nIn the table II some information about the completly sequenced IncP-1 plasmids \n\nthat represent the full known diversity within this 281 bp-region of the trfA gene is shown.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n \n\n \n\nTable II.

There are two important practical aspects to take into \n\naccount: the first one is the quality of the plasmid DNA, because the analysis may be \n\nimpaired by partial digest; the second one is the correct selection of the most suitable \n\nrestriction endonuclease useful to generate appropriate restriction fragment length \n\npolymorphism (RFLP) patters, which depends on the plasmid sequence. \n\nStudies concerning the heterologous DNA encoding certain phenotypic traits are of \n\nlimited value for plasmid classification in its strict sense, since identical transposons can \n\noccur on different nonrelated plasmids. Nevertheless, research on these accessory \n\nfunctions is essential to determine the ecological role of plasmids and improve the \n\nknowledge about its evolution as a consequence of the responses to environmental \n\nstresses. Consequently, the great importance of heterologous DNA makes it be included in \n\nthe general process for plasmid classification (Ts\u00e4pe, 1994; Thomas, 2000b). \n\n \n\n1.6 Methodological considerations \n\nStudies in such specific environments as is the case of the SML suppose to play \n\nspecial attention to some difficulties they involve, by establishing singular strategies and \n\nmethodological approaches as appropriate as possible. The sample collection obtained \n\nmay vary accordingly to the sampling method and strategy used and that has to be \n\nconsidered. That is the case, for instance, of sampling the SML or the SSW.  \n\n1.6.1 Methods of sample harvest  \n\nThe SSW and even more the SML in the natural environment are submitted to \n\ntemporal variations at a given place. This temporal and spatial variability of the samples \n\nhas to be taken into account when analyzing the presence of plasmids in bacteria from \n\nenvironments such as surface waters. The quantity of samples should be a compromise \n\nbetween statistical requirements and practical considerations; the time between sampling, \n\nsample processing and analysis should be on the shortest possible way to circumvent \n\nshifts in the microbial populations and their activity and the number of parameters to be \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nanalyzed should be the highest to increase the impact of spatial and temporal SML \n\nheterogeneity on the final results. In addition, natural turbulences may disturb the sampling \n\nwork. The objective is to attain the closest biological composition of the sample to the \n\noriginal distribution in the SML that can be possible (Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2004; Thomas, 2000b) \n\nThe SML sampling techniques used may be therefore the key issue, since different \n\nsampling approaches will represent different depths of the SML, thus influencing the \n\nsamples composition collected. Also, some methods may be biased toward specific cell \n\ntypes, determining this way the results of the research. Consequently, it is essential to \n\ncarry out a complete comparison of all SML sampling methods utilized, especially when \n\nusing molecular tools to analyze the microbial ecology of these samples (Cunliffe et al., \n\n2009a). \n\nThe most common samplers are the mesh screens (MS), glass plates (GP), \n\nhydrophobic (PTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene) and hydrophilic (PC, polycarbonate) \n\nmembranes (Cunliffe et al., 2009b). Employing these methods bacterial community \n\nstructures collected in the SML and in SSW can be compared. However, the question of \n\nthe most suitable method of sampling the SML is far from being answered (Agogu\u00e9 et al., \n\n2004; Cunliffe et al., 2009b). \n\n1.6.2 Methods to carry out the plasmid isolation \n\nThe determination of the distribution of plasmids in microbial communities has \n\ntraditionally been carried out with the initial cultivation of bacterial hosts, with or without the \n\nuse of selective media types, for the screening and confirmation of plasmids, which is the \n\nso called endogenous isolation (Sobecky, 2002). \n\nOn the flipside, the small proportion of bacteria accessible to cultivation techniques \n\nexplains the lack of information on the incidence and abundance of plasmids in the natural \n\nenvironment. In addition, culturable bacteria are known to respond to environmental stress \n\nby the formation of viable but nonculturable cells (Roszack et al., 1987). \n\nConventionally numerous procedures employing a variety of cell lysis and \n\nextraction conditions and different commercial extraction kits have been used in the \n\nplasmid isolation from culturable bacterial hosts; more recently, methods to isolate \n\nplasmids independently from the culturability of their original hosts have become available \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n(Bale et al., 1987). This alternative method, known as exogenous isolation, consists on \n\n\u201ccapturing\u201d plasmids directly from the bacterial community via mating with a selectable \n\nrecipient strain. In its two variations, named bi- and tri-parental isolation, it is required that \n\nthe captured plasmid(s) either be self-transferable or mobilizable and subsequently able to \n\nreplicate and express (selectable) plasmid-encoded genes in the recipient host (Sobecky, \n\n2002). \n\nAnother way of plasmid detection has been established, the screening of \n\nenvironmental DNA. It consists on directly extracting the whole nucleic acids from \n\nenvironmental samples, combined with the amplification of specific plasmid sequences, \n\nwhich is facilitated by the development of DNA probes and PCR primers targeted to \n\nconserved plasmid replication and transfer regions (Sobecky, 2002; Thomas, 2000b). \n\nHowever this approach was not used in the present study so it won\u2019t be longer explained. \n\nThis allows to improve the knowledge about the plasmid distribution in different places, an \n\necological approach that is, as referred before, essential to focus our research in \n\npotentially interesting environments where plasmid isolation strategies should be used. \n\n1.6.3 Phenotypic traits for plasmids isolation. \n\nOne of the most toxic heavy metals that can be found in the environment, both due \n\nto geological processes and anthropogenic activities, is mercury. Molecular analysis has \n\nrevealed a huge variety of genes encoding resistance to mercury ions which are reported \n\nto occur on a large range of plasmids belonging to various incompatibility groups, \n\ncontributing that way to bacterial adaptability and reflecting at the same time \n\nenvironmental stresses (Smalla et al., 2006).  \n\nSince tetracycline was the first broad spectrum antibiotic with widespread usage in \n\nthe treatment of diseases, resistance to tetracycline rapidly emerged. Presently, at least 17 \n\ndifferent genes conferring tetracycline resistance are known and believed to come from \n\nmany different ecosystems bacterial communities (Thomas, 2000b). \n\nThe known habitual presence of mercury or tetracycline resistance genes in \n\nplasmids leads to their use as selective markers to detect or capture plasmids from natural \n\nenvironments by means of the selective isolation of their bacterial hosts. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nAdditionally, the frequent correlation between mercury resistance genes and self-\n\ntransmissible plasmids, as well as the common genetically link of antibiotic resistance \n\ngenes to heavy-metal resistance genes, adaptation to mercury pollution may lead the \n\nspreading of antibiotic resistance genes throughout the bacterial community (Rasmussen \n\net al., 1998). That adds significance to a deeper study on that kind of plasmids. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n2. Objectives \n\nKnowing that BHR plasmids may be gene carriers that allow bacterial adaptation to \n\ncertain special conditions by carrying resistance, degradative or another kind of genes, it is \n\nour premise that these genes can have high biotechnological applications and those MGE \n\nshould be consequently explored.  \n\nAs referred before, ecological and evolutionary approaches are essential to \n\nunderstand plasmid influence on the flow of genetic information in bacterial communities. \n\nKnowledge on the distribution of different types of plasmids and their hosts is also \n\nimportant in defining which environments are more interesting to exploit and have more \n\nlikely attractive results. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon, due to their definite characteristics and \n\nto their special microbial community, may show an important source of new plasmids or of \n\nold plasmid skeletons carrying new recombined segments. \n\nTherefore, the current study aims to investigate the presence of BHR plasmids as \n\nwell as the diversity of IncP-1 plasmid sequences in the plasmids captured from different \n\nplaces of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon and evaluate their phylogenetic relationship together \n\nwith well characterized IncP-1 plasmids. \n\nAnother target of this thesis is a preliminary phenotypic and genetic \n\ncharacterization of the plasmids obtained in order to discuss and justify further research \n\nand whole replicons sequencing, both due to potential application in genetic engineering \n\nas cloning vectors or as vehicles for protein expression and because of the possible \n\nusefulness that the knowledge about some genes contained into it, like, for example, \n\nantibiotic or heavy metal resistance genes, may has. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nFig 2. Sampling sites \n\nin  Ria de Aveiro \n\n(Oliveira et al., 2009). \n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n3.1 Sample characterization  \n\nSamples were collected throughout 2008 and 2009 from three \n\ncontrasting aquatic environments of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, in the \n\nNW coast of Portugal. These sites were different as for salinity, \n\ntemperature and anthropogenic pressures (run-off from agriculture \n\n[1.-Costa Nova-CN], port activities [2.-Cais do Sporting-CS] and \n\nindustry [3.-Cais do Chegado-CC]). In each sampling site, glass plate \n\nmethod was employed to harvest samples from the SML and a flask \n\nsubmerged at a depth of 40 cm was used to gather samples from the \n\nSSW (Ramos, 2009; Oliveira et al., 2009). \n\nOn one hand, in order to determine the BHR plasmid \n\ndistribution by endogenous isolation, the culturable bacterial fraction \n\nwas analyzed. Right through a previous research investigation \n\n(Ramos, 2009) the bacterial strains harvested had been cultured and \n\nisolated, resulting in 402 bacterial isolates, 198 from SML and 204 \n\nfrom SSW. \n\nOn the other hand, a cultivation-independent approach was carried out by using \n\nPseudomonas putida KT2442 and Escherichia coli CV601 as recipient strains to capture \n\nplasmids by conjugation. The 79 transconjugants obtained (through the selective markers \n\nampiciline, tetracycline and mercuric chloride) were confirmed by repetitive extragenic \n\npalindromic polymerase chain reaction genomic fingerprints method in a preceding work \n\n(Oliveira et al., 2009) in which also the presence of plasmids belonging to the \n\nincompatibility groups IncN, IncQ and IncW were tested without any positive result. \n\n \n\n3.2 BHR incompatibility group testing \n\nIn this work, the PCR amplification of nucleotide sequences of specific replicons of \n\nplasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups W, N and Q and to the incP-1 subgroups \n\nwas performed in order to detect the presence of BHR plasmids in the bacterial isolates \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nrepresentative from SML and SSW. Regarding the transconjugants, PCR amplifications of \n\nnucleotide sequences of specific replicons was carried out for the incP-1 incompatibility \n\nsub-groups. \n\nAll PCR reactions were carried out either on a Bio-Rad iCycler Thermal Cycler \n\n(Bio-Rad) or on a Bio-Rad MyCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). \n\nThe detection of endogenous plasmids by PCR was performed using total DNA \n\nextracted from the bacterial isolates with the Silica bead DNA extraction Kit (Fermentas, \n\nK0513) as DNA template. Mixtures of the total DNA of each set of 5 bacterial isolates were \n\nprepared. After confirming the success of such DNA template dilutions, every mixture was \n\nemployed as one unique sample for the screening procedure. On the other hand, IncP-1 \n\nPCR testing for the 79 transconjugants was carried out. Bacterial suspensions made up by \n\ndipping a tiny amount of fresh culture into 20 \u00b5l of sterile distilled water were employed, in \n\nthis case, as DNA template. \n\nThree different degenerative consensus primer pairs developed by Bahl and co-\n\nworkers (2009) were used for the amplification of the 281 bp homologous fragments from \n\nthe gene trfA (which encode the replication initiation protein) from plasmids belonging to \n\ndifferent IncP-1 subgroups.

Positive controls used in the PCR reactions for every plasmid incompatibility group or \n\nsubgroup. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nDetailed protocol: \n\n- The DNA from PCR reactions was denatured by mixing 20 \u00b5l of every PCR product with 2 \n\n\u00b5l of NaOH 0.5 N and incubating at 50\u00baC for 5 minutes. \n\n- 6 \u00b5l of standard sodium citrate (SSC) 20 X were added to every sample to neutralize them. \n\n- The DNA transference to a previously soaked in SSC 20X positively charged nylon transfer \n\nmembrane (Amersham Hybond \u2013N+, GE Heathcare) was performed under vacuum at 50 \n\nmm Hg, by using a VacuGene Pump (VacuGene XL, Pharmacia Biotech) as vacuum \n\nblotting System.   \n\n- Dot blotted nucleic acid was UV cross-linked to the nylon membrane during 5 minutes. \n\n- The PersonalHyb hybridization oven (Stratagene) with the pre-heated at the same \n\ntemperature pre-hybridation solution was employed to carry out the pre-hybridization for 2 \n\nhours at 42\u00baC. \n\n- The probes (made up through the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit, Roche) were heated at \n\n68\u00baC for 10 minutes to allow the DNA to dissociate. \n\n- The hybridization tubes with the membranes and the hybridization solution (containing each \n\none the correspondent probes) were incubated at 42\u00baC for 16 hours. \n\n- The membranes were washed several times (twice with wash solution I for 5 minutes at \n\nroom temperature, with wash solution II for 15 minutes at 42\u00baC and maleic acid buffer for 5 \n\nminutes at 42\u00baC), blocked (blocking solution for 30 minutes at the room temperature) and \n\nincubate with the antibody solution (the conjugate DIG-alkaline phosphatase in dissolved in \n\nblocking solution) for exactly 30 minutes at the room temperature. \n\n- After washing (maleic acid buffer for 15 minutes at the room temperature) and equilibrating \n\n(detection buffer for 5 minutes at the room temperature), the membranes were placed on a \n\npreviously prepared tray in a dark environment (without shaking). \n\n- The chromogenic detection began when the membranes where soaked in the detection \n\nsolution.

The DNA elution was \n\nperformed by applying 20 \u00b5l of sterile distilled water at 65\u00baC. \n\n The purified amplicons were sequenced through the chain termination method \n\n(Sanger et al., 1977) by the company StabVida. Then, in order to determine their closest \n\nphylogenetic relatives the BLAST software (Altschul et al., 1997) were used to compare \n\nthe obtained sequences with known sequences. Sequences were aligned with reference \n\ntaxa within the sequence databases using the CLUSTALW2 program (Larkin et al., 2007).  \n\nFinally neighbor-joining trees based on the distance parameter were constructed \n\nusing the PAUP version4.0b10 program (Swofford, 2003). Bootstrap values from 1000 \n\nreplicates were also acquired and shown as percentages. \n\n \n\n3.5 Plasmid DNA isolation and purification  \n\nWith the purpose of further characterizing the detected BHR plasmids, the Qiagen \n\nplasmid Mini Kit was employed to perform the plasmid DNA purification. Extraction was \n\nTable VI.

The \n\ncompositions of the solutions required in this procedure are described in table VII. \n\nDetailed protocol: \n\n- Starter cultures of LB medium (Miller, Merck) containing the appropriate selective markers \n\n(30 \u00b5g/ml for tetracycline and 25 \u00b5g/ml for mercury chloride) were inoculated with single \n\ncolonies picked from fresh streaked plates of the transconjugants harboring the detected \n\nplasmids and incubated overnight at 28\u00b0C with shaking of approximately 165 rpm. \n\n- The bacterial cells from culture volumes of 25 ml were harvested by centrifugation (4500 \n\nrpm, 7 minutes, 4\u00b0C). \n\n- Each pellet was ressuspended with 4 ml of Buffer P1. \n\n- The lysis of the cells was favored by adding 4 ml of Buffer P2, mixing thoroughly and \n\nincubating for exactly 5 minutes at room temperature. \n\n- To neutralize, 4 ml of pre-chilled Buffer P3 were added, starting immediately the incubation \n\non ice for at least 15 minutes. \n\n- Centrifugation (13000 rpm, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) was carried out twice in order to eliminate \n\nunwanted cell material. \n\n- The clear lysate (the supernatant) containing DNA was kept and split into two equal \n\nfractions to avoid subsequently over-loading the low capacity column.  \n\n- Both fractions of DNA were precipitated by adding 1 volume of room temperature \n\nisopropanol. \n\n- Centrifugation at 13000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes made unwanted metabolites such as \n\nproteins and lipopolysaccharides to be removed. At this time, one of the fractions \n\ncorresponding to each sample was used to continue the protocol, while plasmid from the \n\nsecond one was kept at 4\u00baC to be purified afterwards by equilibrating again the same \n\ncolumn and following this instructions from here on. \n\n- When no visible liquid could be seen on the DNA pellets, they were redissolved in 100 \u00b5l \n\ndH2O and 1 ml of Buffer QBT was added. \n\n- The samples were applied to the previously equilibrated with 1 ml Buffer QBT QIAGEN-tip \n\n20 columns, allowing them to enter the resin by gravity flow. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n- The QIAGEN-tips were washed with 4 x 1 ml Buffer QC. \n\n- The plasmid DNA was eluted by applying 1 ml Buffer QF (pre-heated at 65\u00baC to increase \n\nthe yield).  \n\n- The eluted DNA was precipitated by adding 0.7 volumes of room-temperature isopropanol. \n\n- A centrifugation at 13.000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes was carried out. \n\n- DNA pellet was washed with 1 ml room-temperature 70% ethanol and centrifugated again \n\nat 13.000 rpm and 4\u00baC for 10 minutes. \n\n- The pellets obtained were redissolved in 20 \u00b5l of TE buffer. \n\nThe success of the plasmid purification was evaluated by loading onto 0.8% agarose \n\n(Lonza) gel in TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA, 5Prime) buffer at 60V for 200 min. The molecular \n\nweight marker used was GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas).

The \n\nenzyme was chosen for the restriction analysis according to the bibliography and the in \n\nsilico analysis made by means of the NEBcutter software (Vincze et al., 2003). \n\nAdditionally, it is known that IncP-1 plasmids are characterized by a high guanine + \n\ncytosine content. Hence, the use of an endonuclease recognizing DNA regions enriched in \n\nTable VII. Composition and storage temperature of every solution required to perform the \n\nplasmid purification. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nthese nucleotides should give back more enlightening restriction patterns which allow to \n\nbetter compare the plasmids with each other. The previously known pKJK5 and pB10 were \n\nused as controls. \n\nFirstly the purified plasmid DNA was quantified using a ND-1000 \n\nspectrophotometer (Nanodrop). Digestions were carried out by preparing a 20 \u00b5l reaction \n\nmixture containing 0.05-0.1 mg/\u00b5l of plasmid DNA, 0.25U/ \u00b5l of NotI, 1 X buffer O \n\n(Fermentas) and sterile miliQ water and incubating for 16 hours at 37 \u00baC. The enzymatic \n\nreactions were stopped by freezing at -20\u00baC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTo analyze the resulting restriction profiles 5 \u00b5l of every restriction reaction were \n\nloaded onto 0.8% agarose TAE gels, and ran for 200 minutes at 40 V, using the \n\nGeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas) as molecular weight marker. Ethidium bromide-\n\nstained gels were seen using a Molecular Imager FXTM system (Bio-Rad). \n\n \n\n3.7 Electrotransformation of Escherichia coli Top10 with IncP-1 plasmids \n\nWith the aim of improving the DNA quality, the purified plasmids known to encode \n\nfor tetracycline resistance (from the transconjugants 1, 2, 6 and 7) were transferred to \n\npreviously prepared electrocompetent well known bacterial cells (Escherichia coli Top10, \n\nsensible to tetracycline). The MicroPulser\u2122 Electroporation Apparatus (Bio-Rad) was \n\nemployed to perform a slightly modified electrotransformation procedure based on the \n\nCatalog Number 165-2100.  \n\nDetailed protocol: \n\n- Both the electrocompetent cells and a sterile 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) \n\nwere placed on ice. \n\nFig 3. Nucleotide sequence recognition site of endonuclease NotI. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n- 40 \u00b5l of the cell suspension were mixed with 2 \u00b5l of pDNA in a pre-chilled microfuge \n\ntube and incubated on ice for 1 minute.  \n\n- The mixture of cells and DNA were transferred to the bottom of the cold electroporation \n\ncuvette, which were placed in the right position in the chamber slide.  \n\n- The Ec1 program was chosen and one fast pulse was made. \n\n- The cuvette was immediately removed from the chamber and 450 \u00b5l of SOC medium \n\nwere added without delay. \n\n- After quickly but gently ressuspending the cells with a Pasteur pipette, the solution was \n\ncultured at 37\u00baC for 1h30min with shaking of 200 rpm approximately. \n\nThe success of the procedure was tested by plating in TSA medium (Tryptic Soy \n\nBroth, Merck; Rose-Bengal Chloranphenicol Agar, Merck) supplemented with 30 \u00b5g/ml of \n\ntetracycline and incubating at 37\u00baC. \n\n \n\n3.8 Antibiotic resistance assays \n\nThe antibiotic resistance patterns of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and Escherichia \n\ncoli Top10 harboring the identified incP-1 plasmids were determined by the agar disk \n\ndiffusion method on Mueller Hinton media (Merck). Susceptibility testing were performed \n\nfor resistance against a panel of 9 antibiotics, including representatives of the most \n\ncommon antibiotic resistance traits shown by the previously known IncP-1 plasmids: \n\nstreptomycin (S10), amoxicillin  (AML25), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (AMC30), \n\ntetracycline (TE10), chloramphenicol (C10), trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT25), \n\nerythromycin (E15), cephalothin (KF30) and aztreonam (ATM30). The antibiotics disks \n\nwere supplied by the company Oxoid. Escherichia coli 25592 as well as Pseudomonas \n\nputida KT2442 (original host) or Escherichia coli Top10 (subsequent host) were used as \n\ncontrols. \n\nDetailed protocol: \n\n- To assure the use of fresh cultures (not more than 24 hours) the antibiotic assay control \n\nbacterial strain, as well as all the microorganism to test, were cultivated in LA medium \n\n(Lonka) at 30\u00baC (for Pseudomonas putida) or 37\u00baC (for Escherichia coli). \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n- Cellular suspensions were prepared by dipping single colonies of every fresh culture into 1 \n\nml of NaCl2 0.9 % comparing the turbidity to the 0.5 of the McFarland scale pattern \n\n(approximately 1.5x108 CFU/ml). \n\n- Every microorganism was spread on a Mueller Hinton media (Merck) plate, guaranteeing \n\nthe whole surface covering. \n\n- The sterile discs were placed on its correspondent positions. \n\n- Finally the plates were incubated at 30\u00baC (for Pseudomonas putida) or 37\u00baC (for \n\nEscherichia coli) for 24h. \n\nThe diameters of inhibition zones of the Mueller-Hinton media (Merck) were \n\nafterward measured and the susceptibility/resistance breakpoints defined by the CLSI \n\n(Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) for Pseudomonas or Escherichia coli (CLSI 2005) \n\nwere considered. \n\n \n\n3.9 HgCl2 resistance assay \n\nIn order to find a connection between the presence of the captured plasmids and \n\nthe levels of resistance to mercury ions, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were \n\ndetermined. With that purpose, the correspondent transconjugants were plated in TSA \n\nmedium (Tryptic Soy Broth, Merck; Rose-Bengal Chloranphenicol Agar, Merck) \n\nsupplemented with increasing HgCl2 (Sigma) concentrations: 25, 100, 200, 400 and 3200 \n\n\u00b5g/ml. Each experiment was repeated twice, except that with the highest concentration. \n\nPseudomonas putida KT2442, known to be sensible to mercury ions, was used as \n\nnegative control. The lowest concentration that inhibited growth compared with the control \n\nplate was defined as the MIC of the compound (Rasmussen et al., 1998). \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n4. Results and discussion \n\n4.1 BHR plasmid detection and phylogenetic analysis \n\n The presence of BHR plasmids in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon from endogenous and \n\nexogenous origin was examined by means of PCR amplification and subsequently \n\nchecked by electrophoresis or dot-blot hybridization.  \n\nThe PCR screening for endogenous BHR-plasmids was performed over \n\nrepresentative bacterial isolates from SML and SSW environments along the lagoon. \n\nElectrophoresis were carried out for the detection of the IncP-1 amplifications, while the \n\ndot blot hybridization method was employed to test out the results of IncN, Q and W PCRs. \n\nAs shown in the figs 4 and 5, no amplification of BHR-plasmid specific sequences was \n\ndetected for any of the samples tested. Hence, these results suggest that no BHR \n\nplasmids are present in any of the bacterial isolates tested.   \n\nIn this work, the 79 putative plasmids obtained from plasmid exogenous capture \n\nusing Pseudomonas putida KT2442 as host were only PCR tested for IncP-1 BHR plasmid \n\nspecific sequences, since in a previous investigation, no incN, Q and W replicons were \n\ndetected (Oliveira et al., 2009). Fig 6 shows the PCR results using the trfA set of primers in \n\n7 transconjugants. It is possible to see in the correspondent lanes the amplification of a \n\nDNA fragment of about 281bp. As for the remaining samples and PCR primers sets, no \n\namplification was detected. The amplifications obtained for the 7 transconjugants samples \n\nmost possibly correspond to the amplification of a 281bp DNA fragment of the gene trfA \n\nfrom IncP-1 ?, ? or ? BHR plasmids. This indicated that such IncP-1 plasmids were present \n\nin the Ria of Aveiro lagoon due to the specificity of the different primer pairs, respectively.  \n\nFrom here on, to simplify, the plasmids harbored by transconjugants 1, 2, 6-10 will \n\nbe referred to in the text and tables as 1, 2, 6-10. It might be relevant to consider the \n\ndivergence among these seven plasmids, both regarding the selective marker used to \n\ncapture them and with respect to the origin, that is summarized in table VIII. Four of the \n\nplasmids (1, 2, 6 and 7) were captured by taking advantage of tetracycline resistance \n\nphenotypes, whereas the other three (8, 9 and 10) were seized from its resistance to \n\nmercury ions. While two (1 and 2) came from a sampling site in Ria where the presence of \n\nharbor facilities and urban effluents determine the selective pressures, Cais do Sporting, \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nNumber of  \n\nplasmid\n\nPhenotype trait used for \n\nplasmid isolation\nOrigin site\n\nAquatic \n\nenvironment\n\n1 resistance to tetracycline Cais do Sporting SML\n\n2 resistance to tetracycline Cais do Sporting SML\n\n6 resistance to tetracycline Cais do Chegado SML\n\n7 resistance to tetracycline Cais do Chegado SML\n\n8 resistance to mercury ions Cais do Chegado SML\n\n9 resistance to mercury ions Cais do Chegado SSW\n\n10 resistance to mercury ions Cais do Chegado SSW\n\nthe remaining ones (6, 7-10) emanate from a site highly impacted by the chemical \n\nindustrial plants located in its vicinity, Cais do Chegado (Ramos, 2009). At the same time, \n\ntwo plasmids (9 and 10) were collected from the SSW, in contrast to the other five (1, 2, 6-\n\n8), which had their origin in the SML. That suggests wider plasmid diversity both in the \n\nSML (and in the sampling site influenced by industrial activities, Cais do Chegado.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable VIII.

That supports the above mentioned relationships between the \n\nseven captured plasmids. \n\n \n\nAlso, alignments were carried out together with corresponding nucleotide \n\nsequences from 20 other incP-1 plasmids that, so far, represent the full known diversity \n\nwithin this 281bp-region (Balh et al., 2009). Alignments were performed by the \n\nCLUSTALW2 program. \n\nNeighbor-joining trees based on the distance parameter were constructed, from a \n\nmultiple alignment performed with the ClustalX program (Larkin et al., 2007), using the \n\nPAUP4.0b program (Swofford, 2003).

Phylogeny of the amplified trfA gene fragments from captured plasmids from Ria de Aveiro \n\nlagoon (Tcj 1, 2, 6-10) in relation to previously described IncP-1 plasmids, based on a multiple \n\nalignment (ClustalX) of the nucleotide sequences. PAUP4.0b program was used to construct the \n\nneighbor-joining tree. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates are shown as percentages. The \n\ndistances between the fragments are indicated by the substitutions/site bar.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n  The phylogenetic analysis made was compared with the one presented by Bahl et \n\nal. (2009) since the same parameters were used. Both unrooted trees are very similar. \n\nAlthough a few differences can be seen in some phylogenetic associations with low \n\nbootstrap values (and therefore without a considerable significance), the greater part of the \n\nmembers of the IncP-1 plasmids maintain the same phylogenetic distances.  \n\nBy assesing the phylogenetic tree (Fig 8) it was possible to confirm that the trfA \n\ngene amplificated fragments of the plasmids 2, 8, 9 and 10 belong to the IncP-1? \n\nsubgroup. Additionally, the trfA gene fragments nucleotide sequences 8 and 9 showed to \n\nbe closer philogenetycally than with the other 2 and 10. That does not totally agree with \n\nthe suppositions made before, since the plasmids 9 and 10, which had in common the \n\nsame original environment and were captured by means of the same phenotype, seemed \n\nto havea high chance that they could be the same plasmid. Therefore, a feasible \n\ndivergence beetween plasmids with the same origin is suggested. Plasmids 8 and 9 differ \n\nonly in the aquatic environment where they were captured (SML vs. SSW), since they \n\ncoexisted with the same selective pressures (industries effluents in Cais do Chegado) and \n\nboth are resistant to mercury ions. The plasmid 2 is the only one among those four which \n\nwas captured by taking advantage of to its tetracycline resistance and in Cais do Sporting \n\n(harbor and urban effluents).Furthermore, these 4 nucleotide sequences most likely form a \n\nnew cluster, hence revealing to be more different from any other incP-1? gene fragment \n\nsequences known up till now.  \n\nRegarding the plasmids 1, 6 and 7 (all of them captured from the SML taking \n\nadvantage of its tetracycline resistance), the analysis of the trfA gene fragments \n\ncorroborate that they belong to the IncP-1? subgroup and display a higher similarity \n\nbetween plasmids 6 and 7 (which come from Cais do Chegado) than with the other \n\ncaptured IncP-1? plasmid, plasmid 1 (captured from Cais do Sporting). That suggests a \n\nslightly different evolution related to the selective pressure occurring in the samples origin. \n\nAgain, the 3 nucleotide sequences emerge like a new cluster, appearing to diverge both \n\nfrom the closest known IncP-1? plasmid, pKJK5, and from the partially described pEMT3. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n4.2 Plasmid characterization \n\nWith the purpose of further characterizing the captured plasmids a preliminary \n\nphenotypic and genotypic analysis was carried out. To perform this work, the two closest \n\nrelatives to both clusters of plasmids based on the phylogenetic analysis described above, \n\npB10 and pKJK5, were chosen as archetypes for IncP-1? and ? subgroups respectively. \n\nInitially, the seven plasmids were purified from Pseudomonas putida KT2442, the \n\nrecipient strain used in the exogenous plasmid capture experiments (Oliveira et al., 2009). \n\nThe first key fact to take into account to carry out the plasmid isolation is that IncP-1 \n\nplasmids are present in the host cell in a very low copy number. As a consequence, large \n\nculture volumes were required to yield significant amounts of plasmid DNA. In addition, \n\nthis family of BHR plasmids is characterized by its enormous size: all the IncP-1 plasmids \n\nknow until now have more than 45 kb. Because of that its electrophoretic mobility in \n\ncomparison with genomic DNA is expected to be very similar, complicating the plasmid \n\nDNA purity analysis. Anyhow, the success of the plasmid purification can be noticed in the \n\nfig 9. A subtle difference in the position of both kinds of DNA can be appreciated. \n\nAdditionally, a second DNA conformation in the plasmid 10 is detected, although may be \n\nconsidered an artifact from the plasmid purification procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 9.  Illustration of the 0,8% agarose gel where every purified plasmid DNA as well as the \n\ngenomic DNA extracted from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (the bacterial host in every cases) \n\nran for 200 minutes at 60 V.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nRestriction fragment analyses were carried out to compare genetically the isolated \n\nplasmid DNAs. Different band profiles were obtained through the digestion of each one of \n\nthe seven purified plasmids as well as the two models with the endonuclease NotI. The \n\nresults (figs 10 and 11) allow affirming that six plasmids (1, 2, 6, 7, 8/9, 10) isolated from \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro lagoon are different between each other and between the two fully \n\ncharacterized archetypes used.  \n\nIn the first place, if both images are compared, the restriction patterns from both \n\nIncP-1? and IncP-1? plasmid subgroups can be clearly distinguished, which confirm again \n\nthe location of the captured plasmids into the two divergent IncP-1 subgroups that had \n\nalready been proved.   \n\nAnalyzing deeply the figure 10 it can be noticed that the restriction profiles of three \n\nof the captured plasmids (2, 10 and 8 or 9) are visibly different between each other and \n\nfrom its closest relative, whereas the plasmids 8 and 9 seem similar by looking at that \n\nimage. That agrees with the phylogenetic analysis, which indicated a higher similarity \n\nbetween these two plasmids (8 and 9), despite the two analysis strategies consider \n\ndifferent characteristics of these DNA molecules: the exact nucleotide sequence of a gene \n\nfragment and the position of the recognition sites of the endonuclease NotI in the whole \n\nunknown nucleotide sequence. In addition, plasmids 8 and 9 seems to be the closest to \n\nthe previously described IncP-1? model pB10 attending to the restriction profiles. The \n\nthree plasmids, coming from different environments (the SSW and the SML of the \n\nestuarine waters of Cais do Chegado in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon in Portugal and activated \n\nsludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany, respectively) are \n\nresistant to mercury ions (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2003),  \n\nBy examining the restriction profiles of the plasmids 1, 6 and 7, it can be assured \n\nthat they are undoubtedly different between each other and from the unique fully \n\nsequenced plasmid of the IncP-1? subgroup. The four plasmids carry resistance to \n\ntetracycline, while the estuarine origin of the captured plasmids is really different from the \n\nnon-aquatic origin of the model, since the plasmid pKJK5 was isolated from a mixture of \n\nsoil (from an agricultural field in Denmark) and manure (collected from a pig farm in the \n\nvicinity) (Bahl et al., 2007). Nonetheless, despite the similar or equal origin of the plasmids \n\n1, 6 and 7 (the SML from Cais do Sporting for the first one and from Cais do Chegado for \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nthe others), the genetic structure of the three IncP-1? captured plasmids are clearly \n\ndifferent. \n\nHence, it is demonstrated that there is an appreciable diversity of IncP-1 plasmids \n\nin the estuarine environment studied, even among plasmids captured from the same \n\nenvironment (whose evolution have been subjected to the same selective pressures). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 10.

The DNA fragments were \n\nelectrophoretically separated in a 0.8 % agarose gel by running for 200 minutes at 40 V. Genomic \n\nDNA from the bacterial host without any plasmid (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) with and without \n\ndigestion with the same endonuclease were employed as control. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nFig 11.  Illustration of the 0.8 % agarose gel where the restriction fragment profiles \n\nof the plasmids 1, 6 and 7 (related to IncP-1?) and the known plasmid pKJK5 used \n\nas archetype of the IncP-1? subgroup digested with NotI were seen after running \n\nfor 200 minutes at 40 V. Genomic DNA from the bacterial host without any \n\nplasmid (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) with and without digestion with the same \n\nendonuclease were used as control. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nIt can also be perceived when seeing these gels that the plasmid purification of the \n\nseven plasmids harbored by Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was not perfect, since an \n\nevident difference in the DNA quality shown in the restriction profiles of the seven captured \n\nplasmids in comparison with the restriction patterns obtained from the two models can be \n\nseen. That could be due to some degradation caused by the purification procedure, and/or \n\nto a slightly contamination of the plasmid DNA with genomic DNA from the bacterial host \n\n(P.putida). The fact that the plasmid purification of the models (harbored by two different \n\nEscherichia coli strains) give such ideally purified results leads to the performance of the \n\ntransference of four of the plasmids purified from P.Putida KT2442 (the four that were \n\ncaptured from its tetracycline resistance) to E.coli Top10 by electroporation, with the aim of \n\nimproving the yield and the quality of the plasmid DNA. \n\nAdditionally, a phenotypic plasmid characterization was carried out. Firstly, some \n\nantibiotic resistance assays were done with the seven plasmids harbored by \n\nPseudomonas putida KT2442, confirming that the plasmids 1, 2, 6 and 7 encode \n\nresistance to tetracycline, since the bacterial host without plasmid is susceptible to this \n\nantibiotic. It was also demonstrated that the plasmids 8, 9 and 10 do not encode \n\nresistance to this antibiotic. However, further resistance tests were hindered since the host \n\nshowed resistance to the remaining eight antibiotics to be tested. The results of these \n\nassays are shown in fig 12 and explained in Table XI. \n\n Despite that at a first glance these results appear strange (because of the \n\nantibiotic resistance trait in the bacterial host without plasmid that disappears with the \n\npresence of a plasmid), the length of the inhibition hales gives low meaning to this result.   \n\nThe expression of any phenotypic trait encoded by the bacterial chromosome, like the \n\nantibiotic resistances, might be decreased due to the presence of a plasmid burden. That \n\nhappens with chloranphenicol and aztreonam resistance when plasmids 2, 6-10 are \n\npresent, with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance because of the occurring of plasmids 1, \n\n6-10 and with streptomycin in the case of the plasmid 7. \n\nIt also should be noticed that both models are also resistant to tetracycline. That \n\nresults especially interesting with respect to the IncP-1? subgroup, since three of the \n\ncaptured plasmids (8-10) are not resistant to this antibiotic. \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nAntibiotic resistance/susceptibility\nwithout any plasmid \n\n(Negative control)\nwith plasmid 1 with plasmid 6 with  plasmid 7 with  plasmid 2 with plasmid 8 with plasmid 9 with  plasmid 10\n\n  tetracycline (TE10) susceptible resistant resistant resistant resistant susceptible susceptible susceptible\n\n trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT25) resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant\n\n chloramphenicol (C10) resistant resistant\n\nstreptomycin (S10) resistant resistant resistant slight resistance resistant resistant resistant resistant\n\namoxycilin (AML25) resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant\n\namoxicillin and clavulanic acid (AMC30) resistant resistant\n\nerythromycin (E15) resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant\n\ncephalothin (KF30) resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant resistant\n\naztreonam (ATM30) slight resistance slight resistance\n\nThere was an inhibition hale of 8 mm\n\nThere was an inhibition hale of 10 mm There was an inhibition hale of 10 mm\n\nAlso resistant, but with a larger inhibition hale\n\nPseudomonas putida KT 2442\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n     \n\n       \n\n    \n\nTable XI.

Then \n\ndespite the bacterial strains that carry plasmids 8, 9 and 10 are sensible to a concentration \n\nsimilar or higher than 400 of HgCl2 \u00b5g/ml it can be affirmed that plasmids 8, 9 and 10 \n\nencode resistance to mercury ions. The other plasmids don\u2019t encode this resistance. \n\nAll the captured plasmids which showed resistance to mercury ions belong to the \n\nIncP-1? subgroup. The model pB10, representing this subgroup in this research, was also \n\ndescribed to be resistant to mercury ions. Unlike, the remaining member or this subgroup \n\nwithin the captured plasmids, the plasmid 2, is sensible to this heavy metal presence. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable XIII.

General discussion and conclusions \n\n Previous ecological studies, by means of screening of environmental DNA, on the \n\nincidence of BHR plasmids in the estuarine environment Ria de Aveiro lagoon suggested \n\nthat there may be an interesting presence of BHR plasmids in this special niche. \n\nTherefore, two approaches were used in preceding investigations to capture these \n\npromiscuous plasmids: endogenous and exogenous isolations, in which also the presence \n\nof plasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups IncN, IncQ and IncW were tested \n\nwithout any positive result. In this work, the occurrence of IncP plasmids over the bacterial \n\nisolates representing contrasting environments from the lagoon and the incidence of IncP, \n\nIncQ, IncN and IncW plasmids over the transconjugants obtained from the same sample \n\nsites were tested by PCR. That strategy is not absolutely reliable, but has limitations which \n\nlead to a biased analysis. The fact that the primers are constructed only from previously \n\nknown sequences is the main handicap since that disables the detection of replicons \n\nwithout these specific nucleotide series. That way, the inability to find replicons where the \n\nevolution has pushed any significant change in the target sequences is assumed. \n\n No BHR plasmid presence appeared among endogenous bacteria by means of \n\nthe PCR screening. Due to the restrictions of the screening method this doesn\u2019t assure the \n\nabsence of this sort of plasmids among the assayed samples, but just suggests that there \n\nare not BHR plasmids containing the specific nucleotide sequences employed as targets \n\nfor every incompatibility group tested amongst the cultures related to the endogenous \n\nisolation approach. The same can be explained regarding to IncQ, IncN and IncW \n\nplasmids occurring in the samples coming from the exogenous isolation.  \n\nIn contrast, seven transconjugants containing IncP-1 plasmids came up as a result \n\nof exogenous isolation with Pseudomonas putida KT2442 as recipient strain, which proved \n\nthe presence of IncP-1 plasmids in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The importance of this \n\ncomes from that it is the first time that IncP-1 plasmids are isolated from an estuarine \n\nenvironment. In addition, that strongly suggests that the special conditions occurring in this \n\nenvironment stimulated the flow of MGE, allowing bacterial evolution. \n\n The divergence among the seven captured plasmids, both with regard to the \n\nphenotype trait employed for its selection (tetracycline resistance in the case of the \n\nplasmids 1, 2, 6 and 7; resistance to mercury ions for 8, 9 and 10) and in connection with \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nthe contrasting environments along the lagoon they were collected from (SML for 1, 2, 6-8 \n\nvs. SSW for 9 and 10; Cais do Sporting for 1 and 2 vs. Cais do Chegado for 6-10), should \n\nbe considered. A wider plasmid diversity might be assumed, therefore, both in the SML \n\n(where the particular surrounding circumstances are known to favor the HGT) and in the \n\nsample site Cais do Chegado (where the high pressure made by chemical industrial \n\neffluents may lead the evolution). \n\nThe seven 281 bp amplicons were purified, sequenced and analyzed to be \n\nphylogenetically affiliated into its correspondent IncP-1 subgroups. Four plasmids (2, 8, 9 \n\nand 10), coming from the different locations above explained, three of them conferring \n\nmercury resistance and one tetracycline resistance (2), were confirmed to belong to the \n\nIncP-1? subgroup. And the other three plasmids (1, 6 and 7), captured from the SML of \n\ntwo estuarine environments from its tetracycline resistance, were determined to belong to \n\nthe IncP-1? subgroup.  \n\nRegarding the IncP-1? subgroup, a sub-division into two different phylogenetic \n\nbranches had previously been suggested (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2003) by means of multiple \n\nalignments of several sequences. That divergence was also displayed in the phylogenetic \n\ntree presented here, which in addition to its general similarity with the neighbor-joining tree \n\npresented in the work of Bahl and colleagues (2009) adds soundness to the obtained \n\nphylogeny. This sub-division within this subgroup was not observed among the plasmids \n\nobtained from the lagoon, but all the four IncP-1? captured plasmids group together in a \n\ncluster contained in the same branch as the fully described archetype pB10, one of the \n\nclosest relatives. The plasmid pB10 was isolated from a different environment (activated \n\nsludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany) and was reported (Schl\u00fcter \n\net al., 2003) to be resistant to tetracycline (like the IncP-1? captured plasmid 2) and to \n\nmercury ions (like 8, 9 and 10). \n\nNo more than two IncP-1? plasmids have been described up till now and can be \n\nused to analyze this subgroup. Barely a fragment of one of them (pEMT3) is known, but \n\nthe three IncP-1? captured plasmids are evolutionary closer to the plasmid that has been \n\ncompletely sequenced recently (pKJK5). However, the three IncP-1? captured plasmids \n\ngroup also together in a cluster. In a really different environment (a mixture of soil and \n\nmanure in Denmark), the model plasmid pKJK5 was captured thanks to the same \n\nphenotypical trait as the three IncP-1? captured plasmids: the resistance to tetracycline \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n(Bahl et al., 2007). Plasmids belonging to this subgroup have also been isolated \n\nexogenously from piggery manure (Binh et al., 2008), showing trfA homologs of 99-100% \n\nidentity to pKJK5, this sturdily indicates the presence of plasmids belonging to the IncP-1?  \n\nsubgroup, which clearly diverge from the other IncP-1 subgroups, and increases the \n\nimportance of further research on these plasmid subgroup.   \n\nThe originality of the discovery of such two novel clusters supports the significance \n\nof this work. Therefore, in order to confirm whether both sets of plasmids really differed \n\nfrom all the already characterized plasmids, and to check if the captured plasmid were \n\ndifferent from each other, a genetic and phenotypic comparison was carried out. With that \n\npurpose the evolutionary closest previously described plasmid models above explained \n\n(pB10 and pKJK5 for IncP-1? and IncP-1? subgroups respectively) were employed. A \n\nsummary of the results of this preliminary phenotypic plasmid characterization of each one \n\nof the seven plasmids in comparison to the known characteristics of the models, as well as \n\nthe origins of all of them (mentioning the selective marker used in its isolation) is shown in \n\nTable XIV. \n\nThe four plasmids confirmed to belong to the IncP-1? plasmid subgroup (2, 8, 9 \n\nand 10) are clearly different from the model pB10, both attending to their phenotypic traits \n\n(the captured plasmids are resistant either to tetracycline or to mercury ions, while the \n\nplasmid pB10 is resistant to both) and to the restriction profiles (pB10 has a genetic \n\nstructure clearly divergent from the rest). At the same time one of them (2), the only one \n\nwhich was isolated from Cais do Sporting, is which most differs from the remaining three, \n\nboth looking at the restriction profiles and considering the phenotypic characterization (the \n\nplasmid 2 is the unique one among the members of this cluster which carries resistance to \n\ntetracycline and to trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole). Maybe the different sampling site \n\n(and therefore the different selective pressures suffered) is related to the difference in \n\nphenotype. Although no differences in phenotypic resistance profiles were seen between \n\nthe plasmids 8, 9 and 10 (all the three are resistant to mercury ions), the restriction profiles \n\nsuggests that there are differences in their genetic structures. Nevertheless, while these \n\ndifferences are not very clear between the plasmids 8 and 9 (the closest in the \n\nphylogenetic tree), this divergence is obvious with the plasmid 10, which coming exactly \n\nfrom the same sampling site as the plasmid 9, differ clearly from it. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nDespite the phenotypic characterization of the captured IncP-1? plasmids (1, 6 and \n\n7) was similar, the manifest difference of its genetic structures from the unique previously \n\nfully described plasmid pKJK5 involves a great significance, increased due to the lack of \n\nknowledge about this IncP-1 plasmid subgroup. Moreover, the restriction profiles proved \n\nalso the divergence among the three.  \n\nSo, overall, the detection and preliminary characterization of IncP-1 plasmids in the \n\nRia de Aveiro lagoon suggested that this environment encloses high IncP-1 plasmid \n\ndiversity, which indicates that these promiscuous plasmids evolved differently from the \n\nplasmids known until now, possibly due to the special conditions occurring in that niche. \n\nThe fact that these are the first plasmids captured in estuarine environments may explain \n\nthis divergent evolution. Anyway, it can be concluded that the Ria de Aveiro lagoon might \n\nprovide such interesting niches to study the IncP-1 plasmid evolution along an estuary \n\ndisplaying different selective forces. \n\nAnother point that deserves to be emphasized is related to the high probabilities of \n\nthe plasmid 8 and 9 to be the same, since they were captured from the same sampling site \n\nbut different aquatic environment (SML and SSW, respectively), while plasmids coming \n\nfrom exactly the same environment, like 6 and 7 or 9 and 10, are clearly different. That \n\nmay suggest that the selective pressures are much more important in the evolution than \n\nthe aquatic environment (SML or SSW). Nonetheless, the low number of captured \n\nplasmids strongly disables the establishment of any pattern of plasmid characterization \n\nand distribution according to the ecological niches and the particular conditions occurring \n\nin each environment. \n\nFinally, the most significant results obtained in this research are the discovery of at \n\nleast six novel IncP-1 plasmids. As mobile genetic elements with an enormous range of \n\nbacterial host, the IncP-1 plasmids represent a huge bacterial diversity source and a highly \n\nuseful gene spring, since they carry nucleotide sequences that encode traits that allow \n\nmicrobial adaptation to special niches, even more varied due to the extremely different \n\nbacterial hosts in which they can be maintained. Therefore, the implication of the discovery \n\nof unknown promiscuous plasmids is due to the really important role they play in the HGT \n\n(and therefore, in microbial evolution). \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nThe whole description of a novel plasmid may lead to the discovery of unaware \n\ngenes encoding potentially useful traits (since MGE allows bacterial adaptation, they must \n\ncarry genes encoding for phenotypic traits that are beneficial for bacteria, and they might \n\nbe useful for humans too). In addition, the plasmids may be useful as cloning vectors or \n\nprotein expression vehicles in genetic engineering, which only can become possible from a \n\ncomplete and exhaustive understanding and familiarity with these entities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n9\n\n \n\n \n\npKJK5 (IncP-1 ? \n\narchetype)\n1 6 7\n\npB10 (IncP-1 ? \n\narchetype)\n2 8 9 10\n\nSoil/manure, Taastrup, \n\nDenmark            \n\nSML                 \n\nCais do Sporting       \n\n(port activities)         \n\n[selective marker: Tet]\n\nSML                 \n\nCasi do Chegado      \n\n(industry)          \n\n[selective marker: Tet]\n\nSML                 \n\nCasi do Chegado      \n\n(industry)          \n\n[selective marker: Tet]\n\nActivated sludge from \n\nmunicipal wastewater \n\ntreatment plant, \n\nBraunschweig, \n\nGermany\n\nSML                 \n\nCais do Sporting       \n\n(port activities)         \n\n[selective marker: Tet]\n\nSML                 \n\nCasi do Chegado      \n\n(industry)          \n\n[selective marker: Hg]\n\nSSW                 \n\nCasi do Chegado      \n\n(industry)          \n\n[selective marker: Hg]\n\nSSW                 \n\nCasi do Chegado      \n\n(industry)          \n\n[selective marker: Hg]\n\nresistance to mercury ions no no no no YES no YES YES YES\n\nresistance to tetracycline YES YES YES YES YES YES no no no\n\nresistance to trimethoprim-\n\nsulfamethoxazole\nno no no no no YES - - -\n\nresistance to chloramphenicol no no no no no no - - -\n\nresistance to streptomycin no - - - YES - - - -\n\nresistance to amoxycilin no no no no YES no - - -\n\nresistance to amoxicillin and \n\nclavulanic acid\nno no no no no no - - -\n\nresistance to erythromycin no - - - no - - - -\n\nresistance to cephalothin no no no no no no - - -\n\nresistance to aztreonam no no no no no no - - -\n\nPLASMID NAME\n\np\nh\n\ne\nn\n\no\nty\n\np\ne\n\n t\nra\n\nit\ns\n\n e\nn\n\nc\no\n\nd\ne\n\nd\n\n* The squares filled with a - indicate not tested traits\n\norigin\n\n                    \n\n \n\nTable XIV: Comparison between the seven plasmids obtained from the Ria de Aveiro lagoon and the previously described model plasmids, pKJK5 and pB10 \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n6.
