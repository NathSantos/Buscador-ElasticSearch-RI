They are used to produce energy that fuels all kind of industries and generates electricity. According to the OECD environmental outlook, the emissions are expected to grow 50% between now and until 2050, primarily due to a 70% growth in energy-related CO2 emissions. In Europe, the chemical industry accounted for 14% of total greenhouse emissions in 1990.6 In an effort to tackle this global problem, efforts are being made by the chemical companies by developing more ecological products. One alternative carbon source to the fossil fuels is the production of multifunctional polyols from the plant biomass by a solvolysis liquefaction process. In this work, polyols were successfully produced by an acid liquefaction of eucalyptus bark, pine wood chips, cork powder and poplar wood chips, at 160\u00b0C and an ambient pressure, with conversion ratios of 58-91%, depending on the biomass. These new polyols, or lignopolyols, had an OH value of 193-303 mg KOH/g and a water content of 0,311,07%. The infrared spectra analysis concluded that they were an aromatic compound, with carbonyl and OH groups, which led to the conclusion that they must be derived from lignin and suberin.\nAfter they were produced, the polyols from a base OCF formulation were progressively replaced by the lignopolyols in 5, 50 and then 100% parts per weight. The resultant rigid polyurethane foams had good outputs (over 3,5 g/s), an overall almost good quality and low quality degradation after 12 months of shelf life. The foam that presented the best results was the one based on the cork lignopolyol, having better quality than the control foam. However, all of them were very flammable submitted to an ignitibility test, even when a flame retardant was used.\nTo turn them into commercially viable one component foams, improvements in the formulations and further tests shall be done in future work. Flame retardant tests and the measurement of free monomeric MDI with HPLC shall be carried out.\nKeywords: biomass liquefaction; lignopolyol; one component foam (OCF); polyurethane; foam evaluation.\nResumo\nNum futuro muito pr\u00f3ximo, est\u00e1 previsto um aumento dr\u00e1stico das emiss\u00f5es de CO2 em todo o mundo. Segundo dados da OCDE, as emiss\u00f5es de CO2 aumentar\u00e3o cerca de 50% at\u00e9 2050. Um dos grandes contribuidores s\u00e3o as emiss\u00f5es de fontes energ\u00e9ticas como os combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis. Para al\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 uma fonte n\u00e3o renov\u00e1vel de energia e de mat\u00e9ria-prima para a ind\u00fastria qu\u00edmica, o que tem levado muitos cientistas a tentarem encontrar novas fontes que sejam mais renov\u00e1veis e ecol\u00f3gicas, como a biomassa. Segundo a Diretiva Europeia 28/2009/EC a biomassa \u201cconsiste na \u201cfra\u00e7\u00e3o biodegrad\u00e1vel\u201d de produtos, res\u00edduos e detritos de origem biol\u00f3gica provenientes da agricultura (incluindo subst\u00e2ncias vegetais e animais), da explora\u00e7\u00e3o florestal e das ind\u00fastrias afins, incluindo a da pesca e da aquicultura bem como a fra\u00e7\u00e3o biodegrad\u00e1vel de res\u00edduos industriais e urbanos\u201d. Aproximadamente 70% da biomassa vegetal \u00e9 composta por c\u00e9lulas vegetais. \u00c9 estimado que por ano s\u00e3o geradas cerca de 200x109 toneladas no mundo inteiro de biomassa, ultrapassando largamente a produ\u00e7\u00e3o anual de barris de petr\u00f3leo. Mesmo que se s\u00f3 v\u00e1 utilizar uma fra\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa, esta pode apresentar uma boa alternativa ao petr\u00f3leo na \u00e1rea energ\u00e9tica mas tamb\u00e9m na \u00e1rea da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de qu\u00edmicos.\nUm dos processos que tem sido alvo de desenvolvimento nos \u00faltimos tempos para a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa vegetal em produtos qu\u00edmicos \u00e9 a liquefa\u00e7\u00e3o. Este processo consiste na decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da celulose, hemicelulose e lenhina atrav\u00e9s duma rea\u00e7\u00e3o de solv\u00f3lise a temperaturas na ordem dos 160\u00b0C e a press\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica. O produto final prim\u00e1rio ser\u00e1 uma mistura de poli\u00f3is com funcionalidade cerca de 2,5, com alto valor OH e baixo valor \u00e1cido, o que os torna adequados para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de espumas r\u00edgidas de poliuretano.\nNeste trabalho poli\u00f3is provenientes da casca de eucalipto (Eucalyptus Globulus), pinho (pinus pinaster), p\u00f3 de corti\u00e7a e madeira de choupo foram diretamente introduzidos em formula\u00e7\u00f5es de espumas de um componente (One Component Foams, OCF) com o objetivo de substituir totalmente os poli\u00f3is derivados do petr\u00f3leo, criando um produto comerci\u00e1vel mais ecol\u00f3gico e proveniente de fontes renov\u00e1veis. Deste modo, o trabalho dividiu-se em duas fases: uma em que se liquefez e caracterizou-se os poli\u00f3is derivados das madeiras, e outra em que foram gradualmente introduzidos numa formula\u00e7\u00e3o base OCF j\u00e1 comerci\u00e1vel, verificando sempre as qualidades, envelhecimento e inflamabilidade das espumas obtidas.\nNa liquefa\u00e7\u00e3o foram utilizados um monol e um diol como solventes. Depois de adicionados \u00e0 biomassa dentro do reator, a temperatura foi elevada at\u00e9 160 \u00b0C e deixou-se reagir entre 1 e 2h, dependendo da biomassa. Depois de a liquefa\u00e7\u00e3o ter ocorrido, os a\u00e7\u00facares provenientes da celulose e hemicelulose s\u00e3o removidos atrav\u00e9s de extra\u00e7\u00e3o liquido-liquido com \u00e1gua. A import\u00e2ncia deste passo \u00e9 elevada, pois se n\u00e3o forem removidos, o valor OH dos p\u00f3lios ser\u00e1 demasiado elevado e as espumas resultantes ser\u00e3o quebradi\u00e7as. Para al\u00e9m disso, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito importante remover a maior quantidade de \u00e1gua poss\u00edvel dos poli\u00f3is, pois uma elevada quantidade de \u00e1gua dentro das latas faz com que ocorra uma rea\u00e7\u00e3o de expans\u00e3o precoce e a press\u00e3o interna aumente, aumentando o risco de rebentamento. As quantidades utilizadas foram 70g para o p\u00f3 de corti\u00e7a, 50 gramas para a casca de eucalipto e 85 gramas para a madeira de choupo, sendo os tempos de rea\u00e7\u00e3o 2h, 1-2h e 1h-1h30min e as convers\u00f5es 67-79%, 60-66% e 83-91%, respetivamente. As convers\u00f5es da biomassa proveniente do eucalipto foram inferiores devido ao facto de esta ser uma casca, e portanto possuir um teor em lenhina substancialmente maior que as restantes. Os valores OH variaram entre 193 e 303 mg KOH/g e os conte\u00fados de \u00e1gua entre 0,35% e 1,07%. A an\u00e1lise do espectro de infravermelho permitiu concluir que o composto produzido \u00e9 um \u00e1lcool arom\u00e1tico com grupos carbonilo, provando assim ser um derivado da lenhina e da suberina.\nA introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de cada um dos poli\u00f3is provenientes da biomassa vegetal em formula\u00e7\u00f5es de espuma r\u00edgida de poliuretano de um componente foi feita de forma gradual, come\u00e7ando com 5%, 50% e por fim 100% em partes por peso, substituindo por fim completamente os poli\u00f3is da formula\u00e7\u00e3o base. A substitui\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita utilizando um ficheiro de excel existente na empresa, denominado de Foamcalc, onde os ajustes poder\u00e3o ser feitos automaticamente. Depois de cada formula\u00e7\u00e3o estar pronta e devidamente ajustada, foram enchidas uma lata para cada poli\u00f3l. No enchimento da lata tr\u00eas componentes gerais s\u00e3o adicionados: um componente A, composto por uma mistura dos poli\u00f3is, catalisador, crosslinker, plastificante e surfactante; um componente B composto por um prepol\u00edmero de isocianato e um componente C composto por uma mistura de gases propulsores. O primeiro componente a adicionar \u00e0 lata ser\u00e1 o componente B. O prepol\u00edmero de isocianato \u00e9 produzido in situ pela pr\u00f3pria empresa utilizando um isocianato comercial. De seguida, \u00e9 preparado o componente A adicionando todos os seus constituintes, tendo o cuidado de n\u00e3o adicionar primeiro os mais viscosos (para n\u00e3o colar no fundo) nem os de menor quantidade (para garantir que se integram completamente na mistura). De seguida, s\u00e3o misturados mecanicamente e adicionados \u00e0 lata. Por fim a lata \u00e9 selada e os gases s\u00e3o introduzidos atrav\u00e9s da v\u00e1lvula de sa\u00edda, utilizando uma\nesta\u00e7\u00e3o de enchimento adequada. Depois de agitar vigorosamente durante 1 minuto a lata \u00e9 deixada a repousar durante 12h. Durante este per\u00edodo ocorre a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o entre o poli\u00f3l e o prepol\u00edmero de isocianato. Passado este tempo, \u00e9 colocada em repouso novamente mas a 5\u00b0C durante 4h, dando-se inicio depois aos testes de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da espuma.\nNos testes de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 determinada a taxa de d\u00e9bito, em g/s, e a espuma l\u00edquida \u00e9 pulverizada em papel e em molde a 5 e 23\u00b0C, onde \u00e9 depois dada uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de -5 a 5 a v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros visuais, como a quantidade de buracos presentes na base ou no interior da espuma curada. Uma espuma ser\u00e1 qualificada como sendo de boa qualidade se a taxa de d\u00e9bito for superior a 3,5 g/s e se nenhum dos seus par\u00e2metros tiver uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo de 3. Nesta fase, as substitui\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 100% foram efetuadas com sucesso em todos os poli\u00f3is derivados da biomassa vegetal, e todas as espumas avaliadas nesta fase obtiveram uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o quase boa, sendo a baseada no poli\u00f3l de pinho a melhor com apenas um valor abaixo de 3 na substitui\u00e7\u00e3o a 100%, sendo melhor at\u00e9 que uma espuma de controlo baseada num poli\u00f3l derivado do caju. Visto que a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o foi um sucesso, o teste de envelhecimento acelerado foi realizado em todas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es. Neste teste a qualidade da espuma \u00e9 avaliada a 0, 6 e 12 meses, por isso foram produzidas 3 latas por cada formula\u00e7\u00e3o, incluindo a de controlo. Uma lata foi logo avaliada no dia seguinte, e as outras duas foram colocadas numa estufa a 45\u00b0C durante 26 e 52 dias, de modo a obter um envelhecimento acelerado de 6 e 12 meses, respetivamente. Passado esse tempo, as espumas foram avaliadas utilizando o mesmo m\u00e9todo referido anteriormente e a deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade foi avaliada. Ao contr\u00e1rio da fase anterior, as espumas que apresentaram melhor resultado foram as baseadas nos poli\u00f3is derivados do p\u00f3 de corti\u00e7a.\nPara uma espuma ser comerci\u00e1vel, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 ter\u00e1 que passar no teste de qualidade, mas tamb\u00e9m ter\u00e1 que ser B2 (n\u00e3o muito inflam\u00e1vel) e possuir menos de 1% de monom\u00e9rico livre. Deste modo, testes de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 chama foram realizados de acordo com a parte 1 da norma DIN-4102, utilizando as formula\u00e7\u00f5es com 100% poli\u00f3is derivados da biomassa vegetal mas com 5g de retardante de chama. Contudo, os resultados foram negativos em todas as formula\u00e7\u00f5es, incluindo a formula\u00e7\u00e3o base e a de controlo. A percentagem de monom\u00e9rico livre foi imposs\u00edvel de determinar devido ao facto de n\u00e3o haver equipamento dispon\u00edvel na altura.\nEm suma, a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o dos poli\u00f3is derivados da biomassa foi um sucesso, produzindo espumas com qualidade quase boa e que n\u00e3o deterioram muito ao longo do tempo. Por\u00e9m,\ncomo trabalho futuro ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio melhorar as formula\u00e7\u00f5es, realizar estudos de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 chama com novos e variados retardantes de chama e medir a percentagem de monom\u00e9rico livre de modo a que se tornem comerci\u00e1veis.\nPalavras-chave: liquefa\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa; poli\u00f3l derivado da biomassa vegetal; poliuretano; espumas de um componente (OCF); avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da espuma.\nIndex\nAcknowledgements..............................................................................i\nAbstract.....................................................................................ii\nResumo......................................................................................iii\nTable of figures..............................................................................3\nTable index...................................................................................4\n1\tIntroduction.............................................................................5\n1.1\tThe Forests as a renewable\tchemical source..........................................8\n1.1.1\tBiomass Sources................................................................10\n1.1.1.1\tForest Industry Residues.......................................................10\n1.2\tBiomass Liquefaction Process.......................................................12\n1.2.1\tCellulose......................................................................13\n1.2.2\tHemicellulose..................................................................13\n1.2.3\tLignin ....................................................................... 14\n1.2.4\tSuberin....................................................................... 15\n1.3\tPolyurethane.......................................................................16\n1.3.1\tChemistry......................................................................16\n1.3.2\tApplications...................................................................17\n1.3.3\tFoams..........................................................................17\n1.4\tOne Component Foam\t(OCF).........................................................20\n2\tExperimental Procedure..................................................................23\n2.1\tBiomass liquefaction process.......................................................23\n2.2\tAcid and OH value determination titrations.........................................24\n2.3\tFoam formulation development and can preparation...................................26\n2.4\tFoam evaluation....................................................................29\n2.5\tIgnitibility test..................................................................36\n2.6\tDetermination of the isocyanate group\t(NCO) content................................38\n2.7\tPrepolymer preparation ........................................................... 39\n3\tResults and discussion................................................................. 40\n3.1\tLiquefaction ..................................................................... 40\n3.1.1\tBiomass liquefaction results.................................................. 40\n3.1.2\tLignopolyol characterization...................................................43\n3.2\tFoam formulation\tdevelopment.......................................................45\n3.2.1\tShelf life......................................................................51\n3.2.2\tDistillate free formulation.....................................................57\n3.3\tIgnitility test......................................................................59\n4\tConclusions...............................................................................60\n5\tFuture work...............................................................................61\n6\tAmbient, security, and monetary costs.....................................................62\n6.1\tBiomass liquefaction process.........................................................62\n6.2\tOne component foams..................................................................64\n7\tBibliography..............................................................................66\nAppendix 1.....................................................................................69\nAppendix 2.....................................................................................93\nTable of figures\nFigure 1 - GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2e): baseline scenario................................5\nFigure 2 - Global CO2 emissions by source.5......................................................6\nFigure 3 - Areas of land use distribution for Portugal in 2010.8.................................8\nFigure 4 - Distribution of the total area by tree species.8......................................8\nFigure 5 - Main producers of non-hazardous wood residues in Portugal in the year 2013.

They are used to produce energy that fuels all kind of industries and generates electricity. Composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, they are the result of the deposition, under specific conditions, of organic material over a million years. Coal and gas are mainly used in power generation and oil, more specifically his distillates, are mainly used as transport fuel. Other uses include heat generation in buildings and in the chemical industry sector. However, fossil fuels are a finite resource and they can cause irreparable damage to the environment, is mishandled. Much debate has been occurring in the past years related to the finiteness of oil reserves, where some authors claim that we are already in the peak of oil and others say the peak will occur in a near future or will not occur at all.1,2 Another problem are the greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, resulting from the combustion and refining of this fuel, which are released to the evironment. In order to illustrate it, the following graph shows the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents by region:\nNote: GtCO2e = Giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent ROW = Rest of the World\n90\nCM\n\u00a7 80\nO\n70\n\u25a0 OECD Al\n\u25a0 Russia &amp; rest of Al\nRest of BRI ICS\n\u25a0 ROW\na> w o \u2022N\nO in o\nFigure 1 - GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2e): baseline scenario.1\nNote: GtCO2e = Giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent; ROW = rest of the world\n1 Source: OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline; ENV-Linkages model.\nAccording to the OECD environmental outlook, the emissions are expected to grow 50% between now and until 2050, primarily due to a 70% growth in energy-related CO2 emissions.3 The actual concentration of CO2 in atmosphere is 400 ppm, which put us below the 450 ppm limit, but still too near. This concentration limit is important because if it remains below it, there is a 50% chance of stabilizing the climate at 2 \u00b0C global average temperature increase, which is still high but can be a good starting point for the stabilization of the climate. If no greenhouse emissions restriction policies are immediately applied in a global scale, it would cause irreversible damage to the environment. The greenhouse gases concentration would rise to 685 ppm in 2050, which is well above the 450 ppm mark. This will raise the temperature 3-6 \u00b0C above the pre-industrial average temperature by the end of the century, causing severe damage to the environment like precipitation patterns alteration, glaciers melting, sea-level rise and intensification of extreme weather events, like tornadoes and storms.4,5\nTo further develop this topic, the image below shows the emission of CO2 of each sector globally:\n\u25a0 Other sectors\n1980\t1990\t2000\t2010\t2020\t2030\t2040\t2050\nResidential\ni Services\nTransport\n\u25a0 Industry\nPower generation\nEnergy transformation*\nIndustrial processes\nNote: The category \"energy transformation\" includes emissions from oil refineries, coal and gas liquefaction.\nFigure 2 - Global CO2 emissions by source.5\ntechnologies, waste recycling processes and new products to safeguard the environment and to increase energy efficiency of the processes, reducing its greenhouse emissions by 54% until 20127 Rigid polyurethane foams were one of the contributors to this reduction, because they are an excellent insulator and were easily applied in house insulating, increasing their energy efficiency and reducing greatly the greenhouse gas emissions caused by house heating and cooling. However, if it is possible to substitute some components of the foams for others that require less energy to produce, it will increase the energy efficiency of the process, and thus reducing even more the greenhouse gas emissions. One of the promising alternatives is the biomass derived chemical compounds.\nIn the following chapters it will be discussed what's the biomass and how can it be used to produce polyols, some history background of the polyurethane foams, its markets and how they are made. Then the biomass derived polyols will be inserted in a formulation in an attempt to produce biomass based polyurethanes.\n1.1 The Forests as a renewable chemical source\nForests and wooded land cover more than 40% EU land area. Mainly, they provide wood, but also non-wood products, like food, resins, medicinal or cosmetic reagents and cork. In Portugal, about one third of its land area is covered by forests, which 50% of it is available as wood supply.\nUrban Inland Waters 5% 2%\nImproductive\n2%\nForest\n35%\nWoods and Pasture 32%\nAgriculture\n24%\nFigure 3 - Areas of land use distribution for Portugal in 2010.8\nAccording to figure 4, it's safe to assume that this wood supply is mainly composed by blue gum, maritime pine and the cork oak tree.\nOther trees\n6%\nMaritime pine 23%\nBlue gum\n26%\nStone pine\n6%\nChestnut\n1%\nOak\n2%\nOther resinous species 2%\n/\nHolmoak\nCork oak tree\n11%\n23%\nFigure 4 - Distribution of the total area by tree species.8\nAs renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric, are the major alternatives of fossil fuels, so is biomass the major alternative hydrocarbon source of crude oil. In general terms, biomass it's all the biological material derived from recently living organisms that can be transformed to produce sustainable chemicals and fuels. In the past years, in response to the non-sustainability of oil supplies and the rising of CO2 emissions, a global first attempt was made to launch a bio-based economy running on vegetable oils and sugars derived from starch or sucrose. However, these accessible products were in direct competition with the food chain, which directly or indirectly increased the effect of another big problem in the world: the hunger. As an alternative, the scientific community began to look upon a very abundant biomass source that was being devalued at the time: the plants.9\nPlant biomass is the wood and bark of the trees. Approximately 70% of this biomass is composed of plant cells, which contains lignocellulosic matter. These matter can serve as the main source for the production of bio-based versions of common chemicals and polymers. The estimated annual amount of biomass generated globally is between 10 and 200x109 tons, which, besides being a renewable resource, largely surpasses the annual production of oil barrels (4.0x109 tons10). It is true that not all of this biomass could is used to produce biobased materials, but this shows that even a small fraction of it can be a very good alternative source to fossil oil.\n1.1.1\tBiomass Sources\nThe sources of plant biomass for the production of alternative chemicals could be the same as used for the production of energy, such as, the residues of forest and agricultural industries, dedicated crops and even the residues that result from forest cleaning process.\n1.1.1.1\tForest Industry Residues\nForest industry is defined by all the industry sectors that use and transforms all kind of wood into increased value materials. Its economic value really depends on the country. Portugal, according to the next figure, has a large area of forest\nThe percentage of the land use of forest and woody regions may be a positive factor for the production of these chemicals. Based on figure 3, Portugal has more than half of its land covered by woody regions, like forest and woods, having the potential to be a producer of plant biomass derived chemicals.\nAs already said above, the sources for the production of bio-based chemicals are expanding and changing to the industrial wastes. The industries that produce biomass residues are the ones that rely on wood. These can be the woodworking, paper pulp production and cork transformation industries.\nIn Portugal, 6% (682 508 t) of the residues produced in 2013 in all economic sectors were non-hazardous wood residues. The main producer of these residues is the paper and paper pulp production industries, as shown in the graph below:\n\u25a0\tWood, cork transformation industry \u25a0 Paper and paper pulp production industry\n\u25a0\tOther industries\nFigure 5 - Main producers of non-hazardous wood residues in Portugal in the year 2013. Source: Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica (INE).\n1.2.1.1\nForest cleaning residues\nSince 1980 until 2013, Portugal is the country with more number of fires registered and the third country with more burnt area in the all the Southern Member States of European Union, which consists of Spain, France, Italy and Greece. In 2013, Portugal shared a 52% of the total burnt area and 54% of the total number of fires registered in these countries. These alarming numbers are a result of the combination of its large woody area, inefficient anti fire policies, bad undergrowth wood managing and cleaning, few fire combat vehicles and bad preparation of the fireman personnel. However, some of these factors can be future advantages for the production of biomass derived chemicals. All the residues obtained in the cleaning of the undergrowth bushes can be a big source of biomass for the future liquefaction plants. Moreover, the terrain occupied by unclean pasture and forest can be converted into energy crops, which could provide more plant biomass, not only for producing energy, but for the production of bio-based chemicals.11\n1.2\tBiomass Liquefaction Process\nOne of the emerging processes used to transform biomass into valuable chemicals is the liquefaction. In a few words, this process uses the solvent to break the biomass molecules into smaller ones, which can be used to produce alternative materials that normally came from petroleum, such as polyesters12 and polyurethanes.13-19 This process was already studied in wood12,20, agricultural residues15,16,18,19,21 and cork.22,23 The biomass materials may come from the wastes of their associated industries. Turning them into new improved materials increases its value and contributes to the preservation of the environment.\nSuccinctly, the biomass liquefaction process it's a solvolysis reaction, which means that the biomass is decomposed by the solvent into smaller molecules. The solvents used are polyhydric alcohols, like polyethylene glycol (PEG) or glycerol, and the catalysts are a strong acid or base, like sulphuric acid or sodium hydroxide. In the acid-catalyzed the reaction temperature is 110-160 \u00b0C, but in the based-catalyzed the temperatures are much higher (250 \u00b0C). However, all the reactions are made at atmospheric pressure. In the end a mixture of different polyols rich in hydroxyl groups is produced. This mixture can be used directly to produce polyurethane foams.22\nChemical composition of biomass is a determinant factor in the final yield of the reaction. Normally, biomass is composed of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, were all of them are highly functionalized materials rich in hydroxyl groups, which are important in the liquefaction process.17 Another chemical compound present in almost every plant biomass is the suberin. Normally it's present in very low quantities, but in cork it's the most abundant compound, which gives it very special physical properties.\nBecause of their different structures, these chemical compounds will be liquefied at different stages of the process. Usually, the first compounds to liquefy are the ones who have a disorganized structure like cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. These compounds liquefy rapidly in the first moments of the liquefaction because of the great accessibility to the solvent. In contrast, crystalline cellulose liquefies at later stages of the liquefaction, due to its well packed structure that is less accessible to solvents, turning it the rate-limiting reaction step. Theoretically, a biomass that has less crystalline cellulose should liquefy more rapidly.17\n1.2.1\tCellulose\nCellulose is present in approximately 40-45% of dry wood, making it the most abundant organic compound in biomass and on Earth. It is an homopolysaccharide of B-D-glucopyranose units which are linked together by (1,4)-glycosidic bonds. They exist in the form of aggregates with highly ordered (crystalline) alternated with less ordered (amorphous) regions. These aggregates are known as microfibril, which in turn builds into larger fibrils and then cellulose fibres. These fibres are the major component of the cell wall, giving structure and strength to the plant. Without it, there wouldn't exist lumber, paper or cotton fabric.24\nFigure 6 - Molecular structure of cellulose.25\n1.2.2\tHemicellulose\nIn general terms, hemicellulose is a heteropolymer of polysaccharides present in 20 to 30% of dry weight of wood, turning it the second most abundant organic material on plants and Earth. It is present in the primary and secondary cell wall, and its main function is to strengthen the cell wall by interacting with cellulose fibres and lignin. In the figure below, it is possible to see this interaction:\nFigure 7 - Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin spatial arrangements in the cell walls of lignocellulosic biomass.26\nIts chemical composition consists of long chains of a variety of pentoses and hexoses, varying from softwood to hardwood plants.27-29\n1.2.3\tLignin\nFigure 8 - Molecular structure model of lignin in the cork tree.25\nLignin are the encrusting structural materials that embed cellulose in the wood. It can be divided into three types, related to its plant family: softwood (gymnosperm), hardwood (angiosperm) and grass (graminaceous) lignin. The chemical composition of the lignin of each plant family will vary. Coniferyl alcohol is the main component of softwood lignin, whereas confireyl and sinapyl units are the building blocks of hardwood lignin. The lignin of grass plants are mainly composed of ^-coumaryl alcohol units.29\nFigure 9 - Coniferyl (left), sinapyl (center) andp-coumaryl alcohol.\nAlthough the model shown in figure 5 is from the cork bark (hardwood) lignin, it was proven by UV microscopy that lignin is a highly aromatic copolymer of different phenylpropane units. These units are joined about two thirds by C-O-C (ether) and one third of C-C linkages. They also have many functionalized groups like methoxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and some aldehyde groups.24\n1.2.4\tSuberin\nSuberin is a biopolymer found more commonly in the outer bark of trees. It is named after the Quercus Suber, cork tree, in which 40% of its outer bark cell walls are composed by it. Suberin has two different polymeric domains: one aromatic composed of polyphenols linked via glycerol to another domain composed of polyaliphatic long chain molecules.\nAromatic\n,O**S\n6\n9\nAliphatic\nFigure 10 - Suberin molecular structure.46\nThe main function of suberin in plants is to be a physical barrier, in order to prevent water loss from the tissues as well as providing pathogenic protection.30\n1.3\tPolyurethane\nA polymer is a macromolecule which consists of identical constitutional repeating units, also called structural units or monomers. If the monomers are chemically identical they form a homopolymer, but if they are different they are called heteropolymers. Depending on the chemical structure of the monomers, polymers can assume a linear, branched or even a 3D structure. Polyurethane is any copolymer with a characteristic urethane linkage between his two monomers. A urethane linkage is defined as an amide and ester group in the same carbonyl group, and it was discovered in 1849 when Wurtz and Hoffmann studied the reaction between isocyanate and a compound with alcohol groups.31,32\n0\nFigure 11 - Urethane linkage.\nAfter some applications where discovered in 1937, the industrial production began, giving birth to one of the most versatile copolymers available in the market. They can be adhesives, coatings, elastomers, sealants and foams.31\n1.3.1\tChemistry\nThe reaction that Wurzt and Hoffmann discovered was a simple addition reaction between an isocyanate and an alcohol, with hydrogen displacement. It is exothermic and is normally catalysed by bases. Approximately one hundred years later, Otto Bayer extended this reaction to polyfunctional isocyanates and alcohols, bounding them together successfully in long molecule chains. This was the birth of polyurethanes. The more commonly used process is the one that consists of a reaction between a mono or bifunctional alcohol, like a polyol polyether or polyol polyester, with a di or polyisocyanate group:\nn\to\n0CN-R1\u2014NCO + HO^Sh -------------------------*\t^V\u2019\nH H \u00b0\t\u00b0 A\"\nFigure 12 - Urethane polymerization reaction.\nBesides reacting with the polyols, the isocyanates can react with every other compound that have mobile hydrogens like water, secondary and primary amines, carboxylic acids, and many others.\n1.3.2\tApplications\nPolyurethane is a very versatile polymer. Just modifying the polyols and isocyanates, many applications can be made. The more common are foams and elastomers.\n1.3.3\tFoams\nFoams are ramified polyurethane chains. They can be divided in two groups: rigid and semi-rigid. The use of polyols with high functionality and low molecular weight it's fundamental to produce rigid foams. The low molecular weight assures a small sized crosslink chains, giving the rigid characteristic after the curing process. Also, the high functionality of polyols combined with the highly reactive MDI, makes the reaction very fast, which in turns causes a rapid viscosity growth. This rapid growth don't let the expansion gas be released, which helps the growth and confers a closed cell structure to the foam, which is very important in thermic insulation applications. In fact, in terms of price and possible temperature range, rigid polyurethane foams are one of the best insulation materials in the market, and it can be used in the construction and electronics industry to insulate buildings and fridges, for example.31\nThe semi-rigid foam has two densities: one lower near its surface and one denser in the middle, giving them a very soft, sponge-like appearance. This is achievable using a cold mould and a low boiling point expansion gas. When the reaction begins inside the mould, its exothermic characteristic makes the temperature rise and the gas to evaporate, expanding rapidly and conferring a lower density. However, near the extremities, the mould is at a lower temperature than the inside. This causes the foam to expand more slowly, giving it a higher density. These foams are used in the automobile and furniture industries.31\n1.3.3.1\tElastomers\nElastomers are linear polyurethane foams. They are prepared using one kind of a high molecular weight, in between 1000 and 2000, polyether or polyester diol. Sometimes, to extend the chain even further, a small molecule, like a glycol or amine, reacts with the isocyanates. Because of its relative high elasticity, resistance and durability they are primarily used to produce shoe soles.31\n1.3.3.2\tMarket\nAfter the discovery of polyurethane by Otto Bayer, many patents were filled after. It's presumed that they were flexible foams resulting from isocyanate-water reactions. After the end of World War II, the company for which Bayer worked, I. G. Farben, was closed due to complicity in war crimes (exploitation of slave labour and production of nerve gas). However, two globally well respected and large producers of polyurethane remain until today: Bayer AG and BASF SE. They are the main producers of all kinds of polyurethanes in Europe. In all the markets of the three major types of polyurethanes, that is rigid, semi-rigid and elastomers, the Asia and pacific region countries dominate the volume of production and consumption, detaining near half of the market. The second in line is Europe, Middle East and Africa combined and then its North America region. This is explained by the fact that Asia is the location two developing super potencies, China and India, which have a market driven by industries that are very dependent of polyurethanes, such as construction, electronics and automotive. Furthermore, these fact combined by the low-cost environments of these countries, are shifting the attention of the big companies of the other regions to change their production factories to Asia.33,34\nGlobally, the high versatility of polyurethanes made the world consumption increase from 2 million tons in 1980 to 10 million tons in 2004, proving that the market has a big potential for investors.31 Moreover its production is expected to raise until 2020:\n\u25a0\tRigid Foam\t\u25a0Flexible Foam\t\u00abCoatings\n\u25a0\tAdhesives&amp;Sealants\t\u00abElastomers\t\u00abOthers\nFigure 13 - Polyurethane market analysis by product and segment forecasts to 2020.34\n1.4\tOne Component Foam (OCF)\nOne component polyurethane foam (OCF) are self-adhering, self-expandable product. Because of this, they have gained increasing popularity in the recent years in adhesive, sealants and insulating applications due to its versatility, easy applicability and manufacture. They are called \u201cone component\u201d because all the reagents are mixed in a single container, normally a can, but generally they have many compounds.\nSeveral foam preparation methods can be used as shown below:\n1.\tOne-step system\nPolyisocyanate (Monometric)\u2014\u25ba Component A Polyol--------\nBlowing agent\nSurfactant ---\nCatalyst------\nMix\u2014\u25ba FOAM\n> (Premix) \u2014\u25ba Component B\n2.

In the one-step method, the polyol plus additives and the isocyanate are mixed all together in one step and in 1:1 ratio (polyol and isocyanate). In the preparation of the full prepolymer system, all the polyols and isocyanates are previously reacted together before being mixed with catalyst and additives, and in the quasi-prepolymer system, some of the polyol is previously mixed, with excess isocyanate before adding the chain extenders polyols, catalyst and additives. Both of these prepolymers methods generate compounds with free NCO groups. The one shot process provides an easy, fastest and most economical manufacturing technique, and it's often used in the flexible foams production. On the other hand, two-step methods, like the full or quasi prepolymer, gives control of the toxicity,\nreactivity, structure and the properties and quality over the final product by the manufacturer. This is the main reason why this method is used in the rigid polyurethane foam production, where the control of every property is crucial for foam optimization and to produce good quality foams.35\nOCF are sold in the form of pressurized cans with a \u201cpre-polymerized\u201d compound inside. This pre-polymerised compound is made according to the quasi-prepolymer method previously explained inside a pressurized can alongside a low-boiling gas mixture. There, the polymerization reaction (or gelation) occurs between a mixture, called \u201ccomponent A\u201d, containing catalyst, a chain extender polyol and additives, and a \u201ccomponent B\u201d composed of an isocyanate pre-polymer. In this reaction, the ratios are defined to yield a pre-polymerised product with free NCO groups (see figure 13).36\nTo obtain polyurethane foam the user has only to spray the pre-polymerised product onto a surface, hole or fissure and wait for it to cure. In the curing process the free NCO groups will readily react with the humidity present in the air forming an unstable carbamine acid that will rapidly decompose into a primary amine, releasing CO2 in the process.36\nH\nFigure 15 - Blowing reaction.\nThis CO2 will act as the blowing agent and will expand the foam, doubling its original size. That's why the fissures and holes should be half filled with the froth when it is being applied.\nThe primary amines will then react with the free NCO groups forming an urea link.\nR2\nH.N PI +\tOCN \u2014R2 --------------\u25ba HN \u2014 co\u2014NH\n/\nR1\nFigure 16 - Urea formation reaction.\nSince this reaction is very fast, it will directly compete with the first expansion reaction and will be dependent of it at the same it. With di-isocyanates, like MDI, this reaction will yield linear groups, but with tri and higher functionalised isocyanates it will form a three dimension network.31,36\nAs the froth starts to become thicker, the air humidity will gradually diffuse slower to the inside parts of the froth. As this happens, biuret condensations, formed by the reaction of the urea groups with the remaining free NCO groups of the pre-polymerised compound, will slowly become predominant at the point of eventually replacing the former reactions.36\nFigure 17 - Biuret formation reaction.\nBecause biuret formation occurs only at later stages of the curing process, a strong three dimensional network is already formed, so the rate of reaction will be controlled by diffusion. Only the shortest and most mobile chains containing free NCO-groups, like monomeric MDI, will be able to diffuse and react with the urea groups. This process will further harden the foam, until the process is finished.36\n2\tExperimental Procedure\n2.1\tBiomass liquefaction process\nAs said above, the biomass acid liquefaction process generally consists of a solvolysis reaction under ambient pressure and temperatures between 110-160\u00b0C. The most common reagents used are polyethylene glycol (PEG) or glycerol and catalyst is sulphuric acid. In this work a new method was applied. The solvent used was a mixture of diethylene solvent A and solvent B in 1:3 mass ratio. The catalyst used was 3% in biomass weight of acid catalyst A.\nAfter placing the biomass into the reaction vessel, the first reagent to be placed was solvent A, followed by solvent B and the acid catalyst which was previously diluted in it. Then the reaction was heated until the 160\u00b0C and the temperature was maintained for at least one hour. The final reaction time and temperature it's not fixed and can vary from biomass to biomass. Sometimes the reaction starts at lower temperatures, which stops the temperature rise, and needs more than one hour to complete, so it's very important to adapt the reaction to every biomass type.\nAfter the reaction was finished, it was left to cool until it reached 80\u00b0C, after which one litre of water was added and mixed for a time in order to dissolve all the sugars contained in the final product. This step was very important because, based on previous experiences, these sugars will have a negative impact on the rigid polyurethane foams, turning them more brittle due to their high OH value. Next, the sugary water was filtrated under vacuum with a filter paper and a kitasato apparatus. After repeating this step two more times, the remaining black liquid, which was a mixture of lignopolyols and solid biomass residue, was removed from the reaction vessel by the underneath tap and filtered again trough the kitasato apparatus but now with a previously weighted large pore filter paper. In order to extract even more lignopolyols, the solid residue is washed with 500 mL of methanol and then 500 mL of acetone. In the end, all solid residues retained in the filter papers were then dried in a stove and weighted for the calculation of the conversion ratio.\nThe biomass conversion ratios of the liquefactions were calculated using the following\nformula:\nBiomass conversion ratio (%) =\nx 100\nmr - mass of the residue after extractions;\nmt - total final mass;\nBefore storing, the lignopolyols are then placed in a rotary evaporator in order to remove the methanol, acetone and water.\n2.2\tAcid and OH value determination titrations\nThe acid number or value is the necessary milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to neutralize one gram of an acidic substance. This is a measure of the acid groups present in a substance and is the first step for the determination of OH value. The method used in this work was based in the ASTM D 974 and DIN 51558 norms. First, 0,30g lignopolyol was dissolved in 6 ml of Tetrahydrofuran (THF). Because of the particular dark coloured solution due to the lignopolyols, the potentiometric titration method was made with an Hanna instruments HI11310 electrode. This method consisted of titrating the lignopolyol with a 0,1N KOH solution in increments of 0,1ml at a time and taking note of the potential observed, until pH 14 was achieved. Then, a titration curve is trace with the obtained data. The turning point is easily determined as the highest peak point in the first derivative curve.\nFinally, the following formula was applied in order to determine the acid number:\n_ Vroh x ^titrant x 56,1\n^sample\nAV - Acid value in mg KOH/g;\nVkoh - amount of titrant needed for the titration of the acetylated sample in mL;\nCtitrant - concentration of titrant in N;\nmsample - mass of the titrated sample in grams;\nSimilar to the acid value, the OH or hydroxyl value is the necessary milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to neutralize one gram of acetic acid formed by the acetylation of one gram of a chemical substance that contains free hydroxyl groups. The method used in this work was based on the ASTM D 1957 and ASTM E222-10. First, 0,30g lignopolyol was dissolved in 6 ml of Tetrahydrofuran (THF). Then, 1,6 ml of a catalyst solution composed of 1% of Dimethylaminopyridine (DMPA) in volume dissolved in THF, and 1,6 ml of an acetylating solution composed of 12,5% in volume of acetic anhydride dissolved in THF, were added to the lignopolyol solution and left to react for 10 min in agitation. In this reaction, the OH groups of the lignopolyols are acetylated, producing acetic acid:\nFigure 18 - Acetylation reaction.\nAfter the afore mentioned time elapsed, 0,30 mL of water was added in order to stop the acetylation by reacting with the remaining unreacted anhydride acetic, turning it into more acetic acid and left in agitation for 30 min. Finally, the acetic acid was titrated with a KOH 0,5N solution using the same potentiometric titration method for the determination of the acid number. After the determination of the turning point with the first derivative of the titration curve, the following formula was applied:\nHV =\n(Vblank\t^KOh) x C titrant X 56>1\n^sample\n+ AV\nHV - Hydroxyl value in mg KOH/g\nVblank - amount of titrant needed for the titration of the blank solution in mL\nVKOH - amount of titrant needed for the titration of the acetylated sample in mL\nCtitrant - concentration of titrant in N;\nmsample - mass of the titrated sample in grams;\nAV - acid value of sample in mg KOH/g;\n2.3\tFoam formulation development and can preparation\nX 100\nFoam formulation and development were done with an excel worksheet named Foamcalc, owned by Greenseal Research. In this worksheet the chemicals that were to be filled into the can were divided into three main groups called \u201ccomponents\u201d: component A, which was a mix of lignopolyol and additives, component B, which was the isocyanate prepolymer, and component C, which were all the gases. In the first step, the lignopolyol\u2019s hydroxyl values, densities, molecular masses, functionalities and water contents were added to the existing database in the worksheet. After a base formulation was selected, the lignopolyol was directly inserted into the component A group, with a number of parts given by the following formula:\ns\nPi = Pt\npl - parts of lignopolyol;\npT - total parts of polyol;\ns - degree of substitution in percentage;\nThe parts of the other polyols in the following formula:\nPl*Pb Pn=\u2014---------\nPt\npn - parts of the given polyol in the new formulation;\npl - parts of lignopolyol;\npb - parts of the given polyol in base formulation;\npT - total parts of polyols plus lingopolyol;\nIt is needless to say that this formula only applies to substitutions on a degree below\nnew formulation were calculated with the\nThe figure below shows an example were the base formulation was 50% substituted in parts by cork lignopolyol:\nCONFIDENTIAL\nFigure 19 - Replacement of 50% in parts of base polyols by cork lignopolyol.\nIf the insertion of new compounds or changing the parts of any existing compound, causes a change in the NCO:OH ratio of the formulation, it should be changed to its original value by increasing or decreasing the isocyanate prepolymer parts. This could be easily achieved using Excel \u201cgoal seek\u201d feature. Finally, the percentage of gas in the can, the volume of the can and the amount of them to be filled were defined in the worksheet and all the quantities of compounds were automatically calculated. All the worksheets are displayed in appendix 1.\nNext, the process of filling the can began by weighting the component B and adding it to all the cans in the quantities determined by Foamcalc. Then all the compounds in component A were weighted and added together in a dry cup. In order to ensure complete homogeneity in the mixture, the compounds that were more viscous and present in greater amounts were added first. After mixing the component A for some time and with the extra care to avoid the formation of bubbles, it was added into the can where the component B was already present. If some flame retardant was to be added, it should be after this step. Finally, the gases (component C) are added trough the burets in the gas filling station.\nFigure 20 - Gas filling station.\nWith this gas filling station, the process was very fast and easy to do. After the can was tightly sealed, the burets were filled with the respective gases by pressing the valves until the volume previously determined by the Foamcalc worksheet. Then, the can was pressed and tilted in order to open the valve, and the gas was pushed into the can with nitrogen. In the end, the can was shaken and left to rest for at least 12 hours at ambient temperature, in order to ensure that all reactions could be completed in time for the evaluation.\n2.4\tFoam evaluation\nWhen the reaction inside the can was complete, the foam could be evaluated using any or both of the following two types of test series: the quick tests and the foam evaluation. Both of them consisted of visually rating some properties, from a scale -5 to 5 in order to evaluate the overall quality of the foam in all its states (liquid, froth and fully cured foam) (see appendix 2). All the measured foam properties are summed up in the following table:\nTable 1 - General overview of quick test.\n\tProperties\tStage\n\tShaking rate\tLiquid mixture inside the can (Quick test)\n\tOutput*\tFroth after dispensing (Quick test)\nPaper\tFroth shrinkage Froth outflow Crumbling after 1 hour Crumbling after 2 hours Crumbling after 24 hours\t\n\tCuring shrinkage/W arping Glass bubbles Cell structure Voids &amp; Pinholes Base holes Cell collapse Curing streaks\tCured foam (Foam evaluation)\nMould\tShrinkage mould Glass bubbles Cell structure Voids &amp; Pinholes Base holes Cell collapse Curing streaks\t\nThe quick test only rated the properties of the liquid inside the can and the curing froth. The foam evaluation consisted of rating the properties inherent only to fully cured foam. As it was presented in the table above, these properties were measured from top to bottom. In the following chapters, each of these properties and the general procedure to measure them will be explained.\n2.4.1.1\tShaking rate\nAfter the foam reacted in the can, it was placed in the fridge at 5\u00b0C for at least 4h, in order to cool the liquid inside. Then the can was shaken and a rating was given, where -5 means the liquid inside was very viscous and the 5 it was like water. This property has to be measured in the first initial shakes, since the viscosity increased by each shake due to increasing homogeneity between the gas and liquid phases.\n2.4.1.2\tOutput\nAfter the shaking rate was evaluated, the foam was sprayed at previously weighted paper in a \u00b1 0,01 precision balance for a determined time. This time was not fixed and it should be inversely proportional to the quantity of froth that's exiting the nozzle. When spraying, the back trigger of the gun should be fully pressed in order to ensure the maximum possible output. In the end, the output was calculated by doing the ratio of the quantity of dispensed froth, in grams, per elapsed time, in seconds.\n2.4.1.3\tFroth shrinkage and froth outflow\nDuring the first minute after dispensing the froth it was important to check and rate the alteration of its shape. If it shrunk in size, froth shrinkage had occurred and a value under 5 was given, depending on its degree. If it flattened, froth outflow had occurred and a value under 5 was given, depending on its degree. Both of these properties were independent of one another and could or not at the same time. If froth didn't shrunk nor flattened, a value of 5 was given.\nFigure 21 - Froth shrinkage (left) and froth outflow (right).\nIt was very important to measure these properties in one minute after spraying, because after that it was very probable that post expansion, the reaction of free NCO groups with humidity producing CO2, had begun.\n2.4.1.4\tCrumbling\nThis property was related to the friability of cells in the foam. After dispensing a small bead after the main spray sample in the paper, it was checked by pressing it after 1, 2 and 24 hour at 5 and 23\u00b0C. If the foam shows crumbling, it should crack under the finger with a notorious sound. If it cracks easily, it should get a rate of -5 but if it does not crack a rate o 5 should be given. It was normal to observe some crumbling at lower temperature because of the low humidity in the air and the crystallization of NCO groups, which both retards the curing reaction and consequently increase the foam friability. Two types of crumbling could occur: a permanent crumbling of foam sprayed at ambient temperature, and a temporary crumbling of a foam sprayed at 5\u00b0C which then disappears after the foam was placed at ambient temperature for some time. The crumbling could be lowered by raising the quantity of plasticizers or by lowering the NCO:OH ratio of the formulation.\n2.4.1.5\tGlass bubbles\nWhen the froth was curing, gas bubbles can aggregate at the surface of the sprayed froth, forming a shiny vitreous like layer. This phenomenon was called \u201cGlass bubbles\u201d and it was due to a bad combination of the gases mixed with the liquid inside the can. The gases were a mix of low and high boiling point gases, and after shaking and spraying the liquid, the gases propel the froth and try to escape it. The ones with a low boiling point escaped the froth easily, but the ones with a high boiling point will take more time to do it. Sometimes the bubbles can take some time to reach the surface, becoming trapped under it if it already solidified, resulting in the coalescence of the bubbles and the formation of a shiny vitreous coating. The rating score was inversely proportional to the bubbles size. This phenomenon was more pronounced at lower temperatures, due to the slower evaporation of the gases. When the foam was applied using the straw adapter, the glass bubbles size was lower, maybe because some of them had already coalesced in the straw and then could escape faster.\nFigure 22 - Foams with glass bubbles score 5 (left) and score 3 (right).\n2.4.1.6\tCuring shrinkage/warping and shrinkage mould\nWhen the pressure inside the foam was low during the curing process, the foam shrunk in mould and it warped in paper. The mould shrinkage was measured while removing the foam from the mould. A better rating was given depending on how fully the mould was filled by it after one day of being sprayed. When the foam was sprayed in paper, instead of shrinking, it warped in a concave or convex shape. The rating is attributed by how much it warped. If the foam presented a very low score of shrinkage, it could be raised by using more\nfunctionalized polyols, decreasing the quantity of plasticizer and surfactant, and/or raising the NCO:OH ratio of the foam.37,38\n2.4.1.7\tCell structure\nCell structure was classified according to the size (average diameter) and distribution of foam cells. Ideal foam should have an evenly distributed small sized cell network. An higher NCO:OH ratio, more plasticizer, more blowing agent, less surfactant can all increase the average cell size and worsen the cell structure. At lower temperatures the cell size increased but the structure was more regular due to the better miscibility.38,39\n2.4.1.8\tVoids &amp; pinholes\nVoids and pinholes were gas pockets that remain in the foam after it fully cured. These voids were a direct consequence of a bad miscibility between blowing agent and the prepolymer due to low solubility of gases or to not enough shaking of the can. Higher polyol functionality could lessen this phenomenon. Spraying technique was also important. The foam should not be applied above another foam bead in order to let the gas escape more easily.38,39\n2.4.1.9\tBase holes\nBase holes, as the name suggests, were cavities that present at the base of the cured foam bead. They were formed by the high volatile blowing agents entrapped in the cavities of the surface during the froth expansion, which dissolved all of the froth that they come in contact forming the referred holes. This effect could be mitigated increasing the viscosity of the pre-polymer, which could be achieved by using polyols with an higher functionality, decreasing the quantity of plasticizer, decreasing the NCO:OH ratio and decreasing the blowing agent quantity in the formulation. The higher the viscosity of the froth, less base holes were observed because less gas was mixed in it. If the foam was sprayed on a smooth surface the gas escaped quickly and no base holes were observed. Foam where fewer base holes were formed will have a better adhesion, making this property very important to monitor in order to obtain good quality foam.39\nFigure 23 - Foams with base holes score 5 (left) and score -3 (right).\n2.4.1.10\tCuring streaks and cell collapse\nWhen the curing process was slow due to low humidity level, low temperature or high hydrophobicity in the prepolymer, which reduces the stabilization of the of the silicon surfactant, the cells will begin to coalesce forming zones of coarser cells with low flexibility. These zones were normally in the form of a straight streak, but it could be also curved. They were more common in the centre of the foam where the humidity takes longer to penetrate.\nFigure 24 - Foam with curing streak score 4.\nIf the referred parameters were particularly low, the weak zone could collapse, forming huge gaps in the foam. These were different from the voids and pinholes due to the fact that they have an irregular shape and open cells.\nIn order to avoid this phenomenon it's very important to use an adequate quantity of catalyst in the formulation. If a higher quantity was used, a curing velocity gradient will form, where the foam cures more quickly in its extremity due to the higher humidity present, hardening its surface early and impeding the further penetration of the humidity to its interior, promoting the formation of curing streaks and cell collapse. A high quantity of the plasticizer present in the formulation will weaken the cells and further promote this two phenomenon, so this parameter must be carefully checked too.37-39\n2.5\tIgnitibility test\nThe ignitibility of lignopolyol based foams was tested according to the norm DIN-4102, part 1 of 1998.\nThe samples were prepared by spraying the foam into a mould composed of two 78 cm long and 10 cm height, placed 5.5 cm apart and parallel from each other, as shown in figure 25. The mould width is assured by two wooden wedges secured by clamps at the extremities. Current laboratory paper shall be used for the base of the mould. After the mould was prepared, it was sprayed by water, and it was filled until half with a uniform layer of foam. After 2 or 3 min, it was sprayed again with water and another layer of foam was applied, filling it completely. After spraying it a third time with water, it was left to rest at ambient temperature for 14 days.\nFigure 25 - Ignitibility test samples.\nAfter the resting time was finished, the mould was cut with an electric saw into 6 samples 19 cm long and 5 cm large, drawing a gauge mark at 15 cm above the bottom edge. The sample were burned in the chamber presented in figure 25 at 20\u00b0C with an air flow between 0,6 and 0,8 cm/s. After setting a 2 cm flame in the burner, the sample was placed into the holder/frame and the flame was pushed closer to the edge of the sample for 15 seconds, while recording it on camera. Then the video was examined in slow motion and if the flame\nhad not passed the 15 cm gauge mark, the foam was classified as a B2 (flammable) material. If not, it was classified as a B3 (easily flammable) material.40\nFigure 26 - Ignitibility test chamber.\n2.6\tDetermination of the isocyanate group (NCO) content\nThe method for the determination of the isocyanate group (NCO) content is based on ASTM D 2572, which consists of reacting dibutylamine with the free NCO groups of the compound in question. The excess dibutylamine is then titrated and NCO content is then determined by an equation.\nThe first step of the method is to weight 1 to 2 g of the sample in a 200 ml cup. Then, 80 ml of acetone is added to the cup and mixed until the liquid is homogenous. After that, 10 ml of 1N dibutylamine solution is added to the cup and mixed for 10 min using the magnetic stirrer. In this step the dibutylamine is reacting with the free NCO groups according to the following reaction:\nFigure 27 - Reaction of free NCO groups with dibutylamine.\nFinally, some bromophenol blue indicator and the unreacted dibutylamine is titrated with 1N hydrochloric acid solution, until the colour turns yellow. Then the following formula is used to obtain the percentage in weight of the free NCO groups:\n% NCO\n(Vb - Vg) x 4,2\nm\nVb - volume of acid consumed in the titration of the blank solution (which is 10,1 ml);\nVa - volume of acid consumed in the titration of the sample (ml);\nm - mass of the sample (g);\n2.7\tPrepolymer preparation\nThe method developed by the company for the production of isocyanate prepolymers consisted of an addition of two different polyols, a diol and a monol, to an isocyanate in two different stages of the reactions. First, the polyol and isocyanate quantities are automatically defined using an excel worksheet by inserting the final total mass. Then, two predefined NCO contents are given, one that sets when the monol shall be added to the reaction vessel, and another that sets the final point of the reaction is to be. After heating an oil bath until 80\u00b0C, a flask with the isocyanate is inserted in it. A magnetic stirrer is set in order to provide mixing. Then, the diol is added in full and the NCO content is measured in 10 minutes intervals. When, the reaction reach the first NCO content value, the monol should be added and the NCO content should be monitored until the final value. When the new prepolymer is needed, it should be previously placed inside a bath at 80\u00b0C for 1h.\n3\tResults and discussion\n3.1\tLiquefaction\n3.1.1\tBiomass liquefaction results\nThree types of plant biomass were liquefied using the previously mentioned process.\nThe next table summarizes some relevant results of each liquefaction:\nTable 2 - Biomass liquefaction results.\nReaction name\tType of biomass\tQuantity of biomass used (g)\tReaction time\tConversion (%)\nCork 1\tCork powder\t70\t20min*\t71\nCork 2\tCork powder\t70\t2h\t67\nCork 3\tCork powder\t70\t2h\t79\nEucalyptus 1\tBlue gum bark\t20\t1h30min\t60\nEucalyptus 2\tBlue gum bark\t50\t1h\t58\nEucalyptus 3\tBlue gum bark\t50\t2h\t66\nPoplar 1\tPoplar wood chips (Arrezima s)\t85\t1h30min\t88\nPoplar 2\tPoplar wood chips (Arrezima)\t85\t1h15min\t91\nPoplar 3\tPoplar wood chips (Balsas)\t85\t1h\t83\n*the reaction was stopped at 20 minutes because it was realized that the termopar regulator was not working properly and the temperature had been too high (>160 \u00b0C) throughout all the reaction. Nevertheless, the polyols were used and the conversion was calculated.\nTheoretically any kind of plant biomass can be to produce polyols using the solvolysis method. In this work four kinds of wood were chosen according to the sources presented in the introduction chapter.\nCork powder or dust is a low value sub product from the cork processing and transformation industry. It is composed of very small particles with dimensions lower than 0,25 mm and its mainly used as combustion fuel. Every plank of cork bark produces an average of 25-30% of cork powder in weight in the cork-stopper production industry.41 At present, it was already liquefied for the production of lignopolyols and used successfully for the production of polyurethane foams.22\nThe residual blue gum bark (eucalyptus globulus) used in this work, comes from the first step of the paper pulp production process: the debarking. This process is present in both Kraft and sulphite pulping processes, and consists of removing the bark with the rubbing of the logs against each other - drum debarking. It can be made directly in the field after cutting the tree or in the wood pulp factory. This process produces a residue that consists of long and thin wood strings with wood chips attached. In the beginning it was used to produce energy in the factory boiler, but as the time goes, it's beginning to be discarded away because sometimes it contains sand and debris, which produce negative effects in the boiler machinery even in low quantities. Since the liquefaction is unaffected by sand and common solid debris, this sub product can prove to be a viable and sustainable source of plant biomass.\nIn many countries of northern Europe the concept of energetic plantations became very popular in recent years. Mainly, it consists of planting rapid growth and low resource consuming trees for the exclusive production of energy via plant biomass. In Portugal, some research about the potential role of poplar wood as a carbon source for bioenergy and chemicals was already been made.42 Three types of poplar clones from the same plantation, noted as arrezima s, arrezima and balsas, were used in order to evaluate if the conversion ratio would be affected by different chemical composition of the same wood.\nMaritime pine wood (pinus pinaster) is the most used tree in the woodworking industry. In the wood cutting process, small wood chips are produced and are considered a waste. Normally they are used as fuel in combustion energy generators, because they don't have a great monetary value. One component foam based on lignopolyols derived from this kind of wood was already developed in several works15,43 and the ones used for this work were already synthetized, requiring only a water removal.\nAll the plant biomasses were liquefied successfully using the method described in chapter 2.1. However every biomass had a maximum amount that could fit the reactor, mainly because of its physical characteristics. Cork powder was composed of fine particles, blue gum\nbark was fine bark threads enveloped in each other with some bark chips and poplar was composed of chips of various sizes:\nFigure 28 - Cork powder (top left), blue gum bark (top right) and poplar wood chips (bottom).\nThe following table has the chemical composition of the biomass used in this work:\nTable 3 - Chemical compositions of different types of biomass.\nType of biomass\tMaritime pine wood24\tCork powder25\tBlue gum bark44\tPoplar wood45\nlignin\t28%\t22%\t34 %\t26%\ncellulose\t40%\t18%\t62%\t42%\nhemicellulose\t28%\t\t\t17%\nsuberin\t-\t40%\t1%\t-\nAll the liquefied woods had sensibly the same chemical composition, but some differences were noted. Blue gum bark had a little bit more lignin due to the fact that was an outer bark. The major compound of cork powder was the suberin, which is the compound responsible for the many improved properties of cork.\nliquefactions were the fastest and the ones with higher conversion ratio. This data can be explained by the fact that the used poplar chips are derived from the inner wood of the tree were the lignin and suberin contents are low. Suberin proved to be hard to decompose in previous cork liquefactions using sulphuric acid. 23\n3.1.2\tLignopolyol characterization\nIn order to characterize the obtained lignopolyols, the following techniques were applied: acid and oh value determination titrations, Karl Fischer titration and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).\n3.1.2.1\tAcid and OH value\nUsing the procedure mentioned in the previous chapter, the following results were obtained:\nTable 4 - Lignopolyols acid and OH values.\nLignopolyol\tAcid value (mg KOH/g)\tOH value (mg KOH/g)\nCork\t1\t272\nEucalyptus\t1\t280\nPine\t7\t303\nPoplar\t2\t193\nThe polyols produced in previous works12-16,18 had hydroxyl values as high as 1285 mg KOH/g and acid numbers as high as 28 mg KOH/g, which are substantially higher than the ones of the lignopolyols used in this work. This is due to the fact that the sugars were extracted from the produced lignopolyols previous to the measures. If these sugars, which are primary alcohols, are presented in great quantities in the formulation, the resultant foam will be very frail due to low crosslinking in the blowing reaction after the spray.\nThese values are needed to calculate the molecular mass (in g/mol) of the lignopolyols according to the following formula:\n\tfx 56100 0Hv\nThe functionality branched polyols (f=3).\twas assumed to be 2,5 as a mean value between linear (f=2) and\n3.1.2.2 Water content\nThe determination of the water content in the samples was done using the Karl-Fischer titration method in an 831 KF Coulometer from Metrohm. It uses methanolic solution of iodine, sulphur dioxide and a base as a buffer. The results are in the following table.\nTable 5 - Lignopolyol water content.\nLignopolyol\tWater content (%)\nCork\t0,35\nEucalyptus\t0,51\nPine\t1,07\nPoplar\t0,41\nIn OCF formulations water content is a crucial parameter and will greatly influence the overall performance of the foam in short term. The value should be as low as possible in order to try to avoid a blowing reaction inside the can, which can lead to the production of CO2 inside the can and an eventual explosion.\n3.1.2.3\tFTIR spectra\nMIR (Mid InfraRed ) spectra of the liquefied product and respective fractions were analyzed resorting to an FT-MIR spectrometer from BOMEM FTLA2000-100, ABB CANADA equipped with a light source of SiC and a DTGS detector (Deuterated Tryglicine Sulfate). The used accessory was an ATR with single horizontal reflection (HATR) containing a ZnSe crystal of 2mm of diameter from PIKE Technologies. The specters in the range of 600-4000 cm-1 were collected with the BOMEM Grams/32 software.\nThe obtained infrared spectra of all the used lignopolyols is presented in the figure\nbelow:\nAs can be seen in the previous figure, the obstained spectra of the lignopolyols were very similar to each other, except in the 1630 cm-1 region. The broad strong band at 3350 cm-1 is the characteristic OH stretch of alcohol groups. The bands at the 2960-1867 cm-1 are characteristics of aromatic groups, which there should be plenty since the polyols are derived of the aromatic lignocellulosic compounds. The 1733-1687 cm-1 bands are characteristic of the carbonyl C=O stretching. The bands between the 900-650 cm-1 regions are characteristic of aromatics and carboxylic acids.\n3.2\tFoam formulation development\nIn order to organize the developed formulations a unique numbering system was created. First, all of the formulations that had lignopolyols in it were given a prefix \u201cL\u201d in order to distinguish them from the other formulations that were created in the company. Then, the first digit signified a major change done to a base formulation, summarized in the following table:\nTable 6 - First digit definitions.\nL1x\t5% replacement in parts of the base polyols from 456 formulation by the lignopolyol x\nL2x\t50% replacement in parts of the base polyols from 456 formulation by the lignopolyol x\nL3x\t100% replacement in parts of the base polyols from 456 formulation by the lignopolyol x\nL4x\t100% replacement in parts of the base polyols from 533 formulation by the lignopolyol x\nL5x\t100% replacement in parts of the base polyols from 946 formulation by the lignopolyol x\nThe second digit was attributed to a type of lignopolyol, in the following order:\nTable 7 - Second digit definitions.\nLx1\teucalyptus\nLx2\tcork\nLx3\tpine\nLx4\tpoplar\nLx5\tcardolite\nFinally, the last digit after the dot signified small changes or improvements done to the previous formulation.\nThe starting point was the gradual introduction and eventual replacement of the base formulation 456 polyols by all the lignopolyols individually. The reason that this formulation was chosen was because it had the better overall quality and output value results in 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. In order to observe if the introduction of these new lignopolyols would lower the foam quality, a gradual approach was made. In the first experimentation, classified as \u201cL1\u201d, 5% in parts of the base polyols were replaced by lignopolyols according to the procedure referred in the previous chapter. Five different formulations were made and can be seen in appendix 1. The quick test and foam evaluation results of the L1 foams are presented in the following table along the results of the base formulation for easy comparison. Ideally, a good quality foam is defined as not to have any parameter score below 3, in any temperature, and an output value more than 3,5, but in reality maybe be very hard. An error of \u00b1 1 is assumed in every given score.\nTable 8 - Overall quality of the L1 foams.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL11.0\t\tL12.0\t\tL13.0\t\tL14.0\t\tL15.0\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t12,5\t\t13,8\t\t2,3\t\t8,0\t\t7,4\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t1\t5\t5\t5\t4\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t-3\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t-2\t5\t0\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t2\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t3\t4\t3\t4\t3\t4\t4\t3\t3\t2\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t-3\t-3\t-3\t-2\t-1\t3\t-2\t-2\t-3\t-2\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t3\t5\t2\t4\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t3\t4\t5\t5\t5\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t4\t4\t3\t3\t1\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t-3\t-3\t-1\t-2\t4\t-2\t-1\t0\t0\t0\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\t4\t4\t4\t4\nWhile examining the previous table, the worse parameter common in every foam is the base holes. In the beginning there was no explanation for this fact, but after spraying water in the paper and mould in the L3 foams experience, the base holes score improved so at this point will be discarded in the discussion. With this in mind, the L11.0, L12.0 and L15.0 foams had two parameters below 3, L13.0 had two plus a bad output value, making it the worst quality foam, and L14.0 had only one, making it the better quality foam of this experimentation. Besides L13.0 and L15.0, all the outputs were greater than the base formulation. Photos from all these foams are in appendix 1.\nFollowing the previous experimentation, a second experimentation, codenamed \u201cL2\u201d was realized replacing 50% in parts of the 456 polyols by the lignopolyols. As above, the quick test and foam evaluation results are displayed in the following table:\nTable 9 - Overall quality of the L2 foams.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL21.0\t\tL22.0\t\tL23.0\t\tL24.0\t\tL25.0\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t15,1\t\t17,6\t\t7,6\t\t8,2\t\t5,4\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t3\tn/a\t4\t5\t5\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t3\tn/a\t4\t5\t4\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t2\t2\t3\t3\t4\t3\tn/a\t3\t2\t2\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t-2\t-1\t0\t-4\t-4\t-4\tn/a\t-1\t-2\t-3\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t2\t3\t3\t4\t4\t5\tn/a\t4\t3\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t3\tn/a\t4\t5\t1\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\tn/a\t4\t3\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t2\t2\t3\t4\t3\t3\tn/a\t4\t2\t3\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t0\t-3\t-1\t-1\t0\t0\tn/a\t1\t0\t0\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\tn/a\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\t4\t4\t4\tn/a\t4\t4\t4\nExcluding the base holes again, the foams yielded relatively good results. The L22.0 foam had the best quality and the L21.0 the worst, comparing to the base foam. Relative to the control foam L25.0, L23.0 and L22.0 were better and L21.0 was worst in terms of number of scores below 3. The results and output value yielded by the L24.0 formulation were very good\nat 5\u00b0C, but when the spray in 23\u00b0C was being made, some viscous dark brownish liquid began to come out. This could mean that a poor mixing was applied after the can was filled with the gases, not resulting in homogenous liquid and consequently a poor reaction inside the can. Meanwhile, the foams L21.0, L22.0 and L23.0 began to get a light brownish colour, whereas the L24.0 got dark brownish. The control foam L25.0 began to get orange coloured. In order to solve the base holes problem, the paper and mould begun to be sprayed with water prior to spraying the foam. In the previous experiment, the paper and mould were priory wetted by in the 23\u00b0C spray of formulation L22.0. A relative improvement has been observed relative to the other foams so this method was applied from now forth.\nFinally, a 100% polyol replacement was made onto 456 base formulation.

Still base holes existed in some formulations. The foam that presented the best quality was L33.0, or the one which was based in the pine lignopolyol, with\nonly one low score in the 5\u00b0C paper spray. The worst quality foam was L35.0, the control cardolite based foam, with four scores below 3. One important fact was that L31.0, L32.0, L33.0 and L35.0 foams presented some crumbling after the 24 hours at 5\u00b0C, contrary on what's in the table. The presented score was given when the foams were left at ambient temperature another 24 hours and the friability ceased to exist. This phenomenon is concordant to what's reported in the company \u201cGlobal Report\u201d document.39\n3.2.1\tShelf life\nOne of the requirements for the development of a new OCF formulation is that the quality of the foam is maintained after one year of being synthetized. This parameter is called one year shelf life and it's evaluated by realizing the previous quality tests to formulations submitted to accelerated aging. In this process, the cans are placed in a stove at 45\u00b0C for a determined time, were one day inside corresponded to one week at 23\u00b0C. For this evaluation to take place, four cans were made per formulation by quadrupling the reactants quantities. Three of them were for the 0, 6 and 12 month and one was for the ignitibility test. The 0 month can was sprayed and the foam evaluated one day after it was made, but the 6 and 12 month cans were evaluated after staying 26 and 52 days, respectively, in the stove. In addition, 5g of zinc borate flame retardant was added to every can in order to check if it would influence the foam quality in the aging process. Since only one the results of these formulations, codenamed \u201cL3x.1\u201d, are shown in the following tables:\nTable 11 - Overall quality of L31.1 foam.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL31.1\t\tL31.1\t\tL31.1\t\n\tMonth\t0\t\t0\t\t6\t\t12\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t15,9\t\t19,3\t\t14,8\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t5\t4\t2\t3\t4\t4\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t3\t5\t4\t5\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t2\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t4\t5\t3\t5\t3\t5\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t2\t4\t1\t3\t3\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t3\t4\t4\t4\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t2\t2\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t3\t4\t5\t5\t5\t4\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t4\t4\t5\nAfter analysing table 10, it is possible to see that the overall quality of the foam didn't degrade too much after 12 months. The foams had a very good overall quality and high output values relative to the base formulation. The shaking rate decreased in the 6 month while the mould shrinkage improved a little bit at 23\u00b0C. The voids and pinholes score decreased below the acceptable value. After 12 months, the shaking rate was good again and the voids and pinholes score in mould and in paper decreased a little bit at 5\u00b0C.\nThe aging test results from the cork based lignopolyol formulation are presented in the following table:\nTable 12 - Overall quality of L32.1 foam.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL32.1\t\tL32.1\t\tL32.1\t\n\tMonth\t0\t\t0\t\t6\t\t12\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t15,7\t\t21,9\t\t26,7\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\t5\t5\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\t5\t5\t3\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t3\t5\t3\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t4\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t4\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t4\t5\t4\t4\t5\t5\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t2\t4\t3\t5\t5\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t4\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t4\t4\t5\nLooking at the results, the foam had a very good overall quality rand high output values relative to the base formulation. The mould shrinkage scores improved from 0 to 12 month and a little decreased was observed at 5\u00b0C, 6 month foam sprayed at mould, but it may be associated to the error of the evaluation.\nThe following table presents the aging test results for the pine based lignopolyol foam:\nTable 13 - Overall quality of L33.1 foam.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL33.1\t\tL33.1\t\tL33.1\t\n\tMonth\t0\t\t0\t\t6\t\t12\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t27,0\t\t20,0\t\t23,0\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t5\t3\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t5\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t4\t3\t5\t4\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t4\t4\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t5\t2\t4\t3\t4\t3\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t4\t3\t5\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\t4\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t3\t5\t5\t5\t-1\t4\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\nComparing to the base formulation, the pine lignopolyol foam did not fall too much behind in terms of quality. First of all, the output values were higher in every stage. The voids and pinholes score was almost constant in mould and paper, excluding the low scores in the 5\u00b0C, 6 month paper spray and the 23\u00b0C, 6 month mould spray. The base holes at 5\u00b0C, in the\npaper sprayed foams, improved a little bit from 0 to 12 month, while they worsened in the mould sprays.\nTable 14 - Overall quality of L34.1 foam.\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL34.1\t\tL34.1\t\tL34.1\t\n\tMonth\t0\t\t0\t\t6\t\t12\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t13,6\t\t11,8\t\t24,2\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t5\t5\t2\t2\t5\t1\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t2\t5\t0\t5\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t5\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t5\t5\t2\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t3\t5\t4\t5\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t-3\t-3\t3\t5\t4\t5\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t2\t4\t3\t4\t3\t3\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t3\t5\t4\t4\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t4\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t2\t4\t5\t4\t2\t4\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t3\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t5\t4\t4\t5\t5\t5\nIn the case of the poplar based lignopolyol foam, the quality results were mixed and diverse. As all the formulations until now, the output values were well above the 3,5 mark and higher than the base formulation. The shaking rate scores decreased at the final stages, some crumbling at 5\u00b0C have occurred in the 0 and 6 month foams, which then disappeared after\nletting the foam at ambient temperature for some time. Finally, base holes were an occurring problem at 0 and 12 month foams, having a particularly low score at the 0 month paper spray.\nIn order to be possible to compare all the previous lignopolyol base formulations to commercial biomass derived polyol based foam, the same aging test was applied to 100% cardolite based foam with 5g of flame retardant, obtaining the following results:\nTable 15 - Overall quality of L35.1 foam\n\tFormulation\t456\t\tL35.1\t\tL35.1\t\tL35.1\t\n\tMonth\t0\t\t0\t\t6\t\t12\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t7,9\t\t9,5\t\t24,8\t\t16,2\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\t5\t3\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t3\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t4\t4\t5\t5\t5\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t-1\t2\t3\t5\t3\t5\t5\t4\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t3\t4\t3\t5\t4\t4\t5\t5\n\tGlass bubbles\t4\t3\t5\t4\t4\t3\t5\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t3\t3\t2\t3\t2\t3\n\tBase holes\t0\t1\t4\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\n\tCell collapse\t4\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t4\t4\t4\t5\t4\t4\t4\t5\nIn general the foams had very good quality compared to the base formulation. All the output values were very good and the only flaw was a little decrease below 3 in the voids and pinholes score at 6 and 12 month.\n3.2.2\tDistillate free formulation\nAs it's already known, all the previous lignopolyol based formulations were based in 456 formulation, which used GA13 as the source of isocyanate groups. This compound is not available in the market, so it's normally produced in situ from the distillation of Ongronat 2500. In order to obtain it, the company relied on external personnel and equipment to make GA13 which presented a constant expense. This year, a new formulation, named 946, was made following a previous work37 in which a formulation was developed by replacing GA13 with Ongronat 2500. This achievement was only possible by making some adjustments to the components of the base formulation and introducing a new prepolymer. That said, a new L52.0 formulation was developed by introducing cork lignopolyol into 946 formulation by replacing 100% in parts of the base polyols. The obtained results are presented in the following table:\nTable 16 - Overall quality of L52 foams.\n\tFormulation\t946\t\tL52.0\t\tL52.1\t\n\tOutput (g/s)\t21,7\t\t-\t\t-\t\n\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\t23\t5\t23\t5\t23\t5\nPaper\tShaking rate\t3\t2\t4\t4\t4\t3\n\tFroth shrinkage\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tFroth outflow\t4\t5\t4\t5\t5\t4\n\tCrumbling 1h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 2h\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\t5\n\tCrumbling 24h\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t0\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t5\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tCuring shrinkage/warping\t2\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCell structure\t5\t4\t5\t4\t5\t4\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t4\t3\t2\t2\t3\t3\n\tBase holes\t2\t4\t5\t3\t4\t2\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\nMould\tShrinkage mould\t5\t4\t-1\t1\t2\t4\n\tGlass bubbles\t5\t5\t4\t4\t4\t4\n\tCell structure\t4\t4\t4\t4\t4\t3\n\tVoids &amp; pinholes\t3\t3\t-4\t-4\t3\t2\n\tBase holes\t5\t4\t5\t4\t3\t4\n\tCell collapse\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\n\tCuring streaks\t5\t5\t5\t5\t4\t4\nThe 946 formulation only presented three scores below 3: low shaking rate at 5\u00b0C, warping and large base holes at the 23\u00b0C. These low scores were solved after the cork lignopolyol was directly introduced into the formulation. However, large voids and pinholes in the paper spray appeared, the foam shrank in the mould at both working temperatures and huge voids and pinholes appeared, resulting in relative lower quality foam. In an attempt to solve the previous problems and to completely exclude petroleum derived polyols in the formulation development, a new formulation codenamed \u201cL52.1\u201d was developed from L52.0 by introducing new cork prepolymer synthetized using the method explained in chapter 2.7. Contrary to what was observed in the synthesis of the prepolymer used in 946, the reaction was very fast and violent, maybe due to a higher functionality of the cork lignopolyol. Because of this, the desired 1,2% free NCO groups was very difficult to achieve and a very low value, 0,1%, was obtained. Nevertheless, its introduction was made and the resulting foam had much smaller voids and pinholes and shrank lesser in the mould. However, large base holes and some crumbling were observed at the 5\u00b0C paper spray. Because of the novelty of this experiment, only 30% of the can was filled with the formulation and the output was not measured.\nFigure 30 - L52.0 at 23\u00b0C (left) and L52.1 at 23\u00b0C (right).\n3.3\tIgnitility test\nAfter preparing the samples and proceeding with the ignitibility test of all the foams using the method described in the chapter 2.5, the following mean flame heights were obtained:\nTable 17 - Ignitibilty test results.\nFormulation\tFlame height (cm)\n456\t17,2\nL31.1\t22,0\nL32.1\t25,0\nL33.1\t23,0\nL34.1\t18,0\nL35.1\t23,0\nAs it\u2019s clearly to see, all the foams, even the base formulation and the control L35.1, passed the 15 cm gauge mark and failed the test, being classified as B3 (very flammable). These proved that the added quantity of zinc borate was not enough or that another type of flame retardant should have been used. Besides, the addition of lingopolyols and cardolite to the base formulation increased the flame height. Interestingly, the L34.1 and L31.1 had lower flame heights relative to the control L35.1.\n4\tConclusions\nIn this work, several types of biomass were successfully liquefied using a method which has some differences from the ones presented in the literature. Some biomass types, like blue gum bark and poplar wood, were liquefied for the first time. Poplar wood was liquefied relatively fast (1h to 1h30min) with the best conversion ratios (83-91%). Blue gum bark was liquefied after 1 to 2 hours of liquefaction with conversion ratios between 60% and 66%, which are not very high. This may be due to particular fact that the lignin concentration was higher than the other plant biomasses. Finally, cork powder or dust was liquefied after 2 hours of reaction with conversion ratios between 67% and 79%. The hydroxyl and acid value were relatively high (between 193 and 272 mg KOH/g) and low (between 1 and 7 mg KOH/g), which made the polyols suitable for producing foams. The infrared spectra analysis concluded that they were an aromatic compound, with carbonyl and OH groups, which led to the conclusion that they must be derived only from lignin and suberin, since these are the only aromatic compounds in plant biomass and the sugars derived from cellulose and hemicellulose were extracted.\nThe gradual replacements of 5%, 50% and 100% in parts per weight of the base formulation polyols by the new lignopolyols were done successfully. A control formulation of cardolite, a commercially available polyol derived from the cashew fruit, was done in every replacement. Excluding the base holes for the fact that water spray was not applied in all of these replacements, the quality of the foam didn\u2019t degrade too much, so the 100% replacement can safely be done at the 456 formulation. Also, the quality didn\u2019t degrade after 12 months in every formulation, even with the flame retardant included in the formulation. In terms of quality, the best lignopolyol was the one based on cork lignopolyols, which was like the control. However, neither of the formulations were better than the base formulation.\nAll the foams were B3 in the ignitibility test, including the control and the base formulation. This was due to insufficient quantity of flame retardant or it was not suitable for this kind foams. Further investigation in this topic shall be made in future works.\nFinally, the introduction of the cork lignopolyol was attempted at the distillate free formulation 946, in order to produce cheaper formulations. The quality of the resultant foam was very bad compared to the 946 base formulation, having large voids and pinholes. In order to remove every compound that was derived from petroleum based polyol, a new cork\nlignopolyol based prepolymer was developed by using the standard company method. After it was introduced in the formulation, the resulting foam quality improved drastically and the large voids and pinholes disappeared.\n5\tFuture work\nIn order to make them a commercially viable product, the foams had to have any property from the evaluation tests equal or greater than 3, an output value greater or equal than 3,5 g/s, 12 months shelf life, be B2 and had a free monomeric NCO value below 1%. The only criteria met in this work were the output value and 12 month shelf life, so further work shall be done.\nIn the distillate free formulation, a new method shall be developed in order to better control the NCO content of the final prepolymer because of the violent reaction. One suggestion is to add the lignopolyol to the isocyanate slowly and monitor the NCO content until the desired value is met.\n6\tAmbient, security, and monetary costs\n6.1\tBiomass liquefaction process\nBecause the lignopolyols are a relatively new product and still not available in the market, the ambient and security was not available at the moment. Because of this, it should be treated with all the care using full body protection when handling them.\nThe liquefaction has the following security considerations:\n\u2022\tDust protection mask shall be used when handling with cork powder.\n\u2022\tBecause of the high temperatures involved in the process, dangerous vapours will be released so it shall ALWAYS me made in a ventilated place like a fume hood.\n\u2022\tBody, hands and eye protection shall be used at all times.\n\u2022\tIf the reactor shall be moved for some reason while it is hot, heat resistant gloves shall be used.\n\u2022\tWhen cleaning the lab material, a residue container for the liquefaction residues shall be used.\nNext, a table with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) data of the all the chemicals and another with the monetary costs of this part of project are presented below:\nTable 18 - Total monetary costs of the liquefaction2.\nProduct\tPrice per weight (\u20ac/Kg)\tUsed quantity (g)\tCost (\u20ac)\tTotal (\u20ac)\ncork powder\t0,4\t50\t0,020\t0,345\nSolvent B\t1,71\t150\t0,257\t\nSolvent A\t1,3\t50\t0,065\t\nCatalyst\t1,9\t1,5\t0,003\t\nTable 19 - Total monetary costs of the lignopolyol extraction2.\nProduct\tprice per volume (\u20ac/l)\tUsed quantity (ml)\tCost (\u20ac)\tTotal (\u20ac)\nAcetone\t35,2\t100\t3,52\t7,58\nMethanol\t40,6\t100\t4,06\t\n2 Water and electricity costs were excluded.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6.2\tOne component foams\nFully cured polyurethane rigid foams are not dangerous to the environment. They are insoluble in water and most organic solvents. However, some important security aspects have to be taken in various stages of the manufacturing and handling of the OCF cans:\n\u2022\tSome chemicals used in the production of the OCF formulations, like isocyanates and tertiary amine catalyst, present some risk to the health and environment and especial precautions should be taken. However, other chemicals, like surfactants, have low toxicity. The lignopolyols toxicity is unknown so full body protection and ventilation should be used when working with them.\n\u2022\tBefore the cans get filled with gases, they should be checked if they are tightly sealed in order to avoid any gas leak.\n\u2022\tBecause of the exothermic characteristic of the gelation reaction, the pressured can will heat up, so it should be placed inside a secure room or container for a day in order to ensure maximum protection if it blows. Moreover, water content of all the compounds should be low.\n\u2022\tWhen the foam is to be sprayed the body, eyes and hands shall be protected.\n\u2022\tThe prepolymer preparation should be done in a well ventilated place and full body protection, including gas mask, shall be used.\nNext, a table with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of\nChemicals (GHS) data of the all the chemicals is presented below:\nTable 21 - Formulation compounds list and GHS hazard and precaution statements.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n7\tBibliography\n1.\tCampbell, C.
