Combined U-Pb and Lu-Hf in situ analyses on zircon by LA-MC-ICP-MS permit to characterize\n\nisotopically the host magma from which it crystallized furnishing significant information for sediment provenance\n\nand crustal evolution studies. In this paper we describe the Lu-Hf systematic by LA-MC-ICP-MS developed in the\n\nlaboratory of Geochronology of the University of Brasilia and report the results obtained by repeated analyses of\n176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratio of three zircon standards: GJ-1 = 0.282022 \u00b1 11 (n=56), Temora 2 = 0.282693 \u00b1 14\n\n(n=25) and UQZ = 0.282127 \u00b1 33 (n=11). The 176Hf/177Hf ratio (0.282352 \u00b1 22, n=14) of gem quality zircon used\n\nas in-house standard have been also characterized. As a geological application, we analyzed two complex zircons\n\nselected from a migmatitic rocks from the Borborema Province, NE Brazil. On the basis of U-Pb and Lu-Hf data, two\n\nmain crystallization events have been identified in both studied zircons. An older event at ca. 2.05 Ga recognized in\n\nthe inherited cores represents a well-characterized paleoproterozoic magmatic event that affected the whole Borborema\n\nProvince. A second crystallization event at ? 575 Ma, recognized at the rims, represents a Neoproterozoic (Brazilian)\n\nhigh grade metamorphic-magmatic event.\n\nKey words: LA-MC-ICP-MS, Lu-Hf, U-Pb, zircon, Borborema Province.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the last decade, the rapid progresses in Induc-\n\ntively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),\n\ncombined with the new techniques for in situ laser abla-\n\ntion microanalysis, made the Lutetium-Hafnium isotopic\n\nsystem one of the most innovative and powerful tools\n\nfor geochronologic and isotopic studies.

DANTAS, MARCIO M. PIMENTEL and BERNHARD B\u00dcHN\n\nIn this paper we describe in detail the analytical\n\nsystematic of the Lu-Hf method for LA-MC-ICP-MS on\n\nzircon, developed in the Laboratory of Geochronology\n\nof the University of Bras\u00edlia.\n\nWe show Hf isotope analyses obtained for three\n\nstandard zircons (GJ-1, Temora 2 and UQ Z6) and for\n\na gem quality zircon that would represent a potential in-\n\nhouse standard.\n\nWe also present an application of this methodol-\n\nogy for studying a geological problem in an area of the\n\nBorborema Province, Rio Grande do Norte. Combined\n\nU-Pb and Lu-Hf analyses, associated with backscatter-\n\ning imaging (BSI), have been carried out on two se-\n\nlected zircons separated from a leucosome portion of\n\na migmatitic rock associated to a paleoproterozoic ter-\n\nrane. Several authors (Dantas et al. 1999, 2004) iden-\n\ntified in this sector of the Borborema Province multiple\n\norogenic/metamorphic events of archean to paleo- and\n\nneoproterozoic ages.\n\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\nTHE LU-HF ISOTOPE SYSTEM\n\nThe Lu-Hf isotope system consists of the spontaneous\n\ndecay of unstable radionuclide 176Lu, by ?-emission, to\n\nthe stable 176Hf with a half-life of 37.2 Ga. The element\n\nLu is the heaviest Rare Earth Element, belonging to the\n\nLantanides group. It has two natural isotopes: the stable\n\nisotope 175Lu and the radioactive isotopes 176Lu, rep-\n\nresenting 97.41% and the 2.59% of the natural Lu iso-\n\ntope abundance respectively. Hafnium is a High Field\n\nStrength Element (HFSE) and belongs to the Lithophile\n\ngroup IVa of the periodic table. It has six isotopes:\n176Hf, 177Hf, 178Hf, 179Hf and 180Hf, all being stable\n\nnon-radiogenic except for 176Hf.\n\nThe abundance of the isotope 176Hf on Earth is\n\nvariable due to the radioactive decay of 176Lu, and in\n\nthe literature it is conventionally compared to the 177Hf.\n\nThe equation\n(\n\n176Hf\n/\n\n177Hf\n)\n\nt\n=\n\n(\n176Hf\n\n/\n177Hf\n\n)\n\n0\n+\n\n(\n176Lu\n\n/\n177Hf\n\n)\n\nt\n?\n\n(\ne?t ? 1\n\n)\n\nrepresents the basic age equation for Lu-Hf method,\n\nwhere t is the elapsed time from the closure of the sys-\n\ntem, and ? is the decay constant of 176Lu. Different\n\nvalues for ? have been proposed in the past by several\n\nauthors. Patchett and Tatsumoto (1980) proposed the\n\nvalue 1.94 \u00d7 10?11 y?1, calculated from the slope of a\n\nLu-Hf isochron for eucrite meteorites of known age. In\n\nthe following, Sguigna et al. (1982) modified the ? value\n\nto 1.93 \u00d7 10?11 y?1. Recently, Scherer et al. (2001)\n\nproposed the new value of 1.86 \u00d7 10?11 y?1 obtained\n\nby calibration against the U-Pb decay system, which is\n\nin agreement with the value obtained by Nir-El and Lavi\n\n(1998) using the decay scintillation counting method.\n\nThe application of Lu-Hf systematic to geoscien-\n\nces was developed since 1980 when Patchett and Tat-\n\nsumoto (1980) and Patchett et al. (1981) used TIMS to\n\nmeasure the respective isotopes. However, due to the\n\nhigh ionisation potential of hafnium (6.65 eV), the TIMS\n\nmethod required large sample sizes and a high purity ion\n\nexchange separation in order to achieve acceptable re-\n\nsults. In the last decade, the new MC-ICP-MS method,\n\nwhich permits excellent ionisation on impure sample\n\nsolutions, became the best method for Hf isotope anal-\n\nysis. The laser ablation technique coupled with MC-\n\nICP-MS permitted to analyze solid samples, as mineral\n\ngrains, with high spatial resolution. The mineral zircon\n\nis considered a privileged mineral for isotope analyses\n\nof the Lu-Hf system (as for U-Pb system) due to the\n\ncombination of physical-chemical characteristics and to\n\nthe capability to host trace and Rare Earth Elements in its\n\ncrystalline structure (Kinny and Maas 2003, Woodhead\n\net al. 2004). Moreover, zircon is a common accessory\n\nmineral, which is present in a great variety of rocks, usu-\n\nally preserving a very complex growing history.\n\nAn advantage to use the Lu-Hf method is that Hf,\n\nhaving a geochemical behavior very similar to zirco-\n\nnium, is much more compatible for zircon than Rare\n\nEarth Elements (REE), especially Lu. Thus, Hf may\n\nreach a higher concentration (up to 3 %) and is retained\n\nmore easily than Lu in the zircon lattice.\n\nFor this reason, zircons are characterized by very\n\nlow 176Lu/177Hf ratios (&lt;0.001) and, consequently, the\n\nisotopic variations of Hf due to the radiogenic 176Hf are\n\npractically negligible. The main corollary of this is that\n\nzircons preserve the initial 176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratios\n\ninherited by the magma where they crystallized.\n\nThis characteristic, together with the high content\n\nof Hf and its very low diffusivity in zircon, permits to\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (2)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/5/3 \u2014 12:28 \u2014 page 481 \u2014 #3\n\nLu-Hf IN SITU ANALYSES BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 481\n\npreserve, in a single crystal, different Hf isotopic com-\n\nposition, generated during crystal growing under the\n\nvariable P, T and compositional conditions. Experimen-\n\ntal calibrations showed that zircon has the closing tem-\n\nperature for Lu-Hf system 200?C higher than U-Pb\n\nsystem (Cherniak et al. 1997, Cherniak and Watson\n\n2000), indicating that the Hf isotope system remains\n\nclosed during most of the thermal events after the crys-\n\ntallization of zircon.\n\nLU-HF EVOLUTION IN THE EARTH\u2019S CRUST AND MANTLE\n\nThe Lu-Hf isotope system is utilized to study the his-\n\ntory of differentiation of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE)\n\nthat led to the formation of the crust-mantle system. This\n\nisotope system has a systematic that is very similar to\n\nthe Sm-Nd system, with some fundamental exceptions.\n\nThe first is that, while Sm and Nd are both Rare Earth\n\nElements with very similar chemical characteristics, Lu\n\nand Hf are a Heavy Rare Earth Element (HREE) and a\n\nHFSE, respectively. This implies in a very different be-\n\nhavior for Lu and Hf during the evolution of the crust-\n\nmantle system. Hf is more incompatible than Lu dur-\n\ning the partial melting processes in the mantle; so, dur-\n\ning the first events of juvenile crust generation in the\n\narchean time, the crust has been enriched in Hf and de-\n\npleted in Lu, leaving a mantle enriched in Lu and de-\n\npleted in Hf. Thus, starting from an unique primor-\n\ndial mantle with chondritic Lu and Hf isotopic com-\n\nposition, which is referred as CHUR (Chondritic Uni-\n\nform Reservoir) composition, two reservoirs with dif-\n\nferent Lu/Hf ratio were generated: the crust with Lu/\n\nHfcrust &lt;Lu/HfCHUR and the depleted mantle with Lu/\n\nHfmantle > Lu/HfCHUR.\n\nAs for other isotope systems, the deviation of the\n176Hf/177Hf from the chondritic (CHUR) values for a\n\nsample is indicated by the Epsilon (?) notation:\n\n?Hf =\n\n[ (176Hf\n/\n\n177Hf\n)\n\nsample\n(\n\n176Hf\n/\n\n177Hf\n)\n\nCHUR\n\n? 1\n\n]\n\n\u00d7 104\n\nwhile the model age is calculated referred to the Depleted\n\nMantle by the following formula:\n\nHf TDM = 1/? \u00d7 ln\n\n\u00d7\n\n{ (176Hf/177Hf\n)\n\nsample\n?\n\n(\n176Hf/177Hf\n\n)\nDM\n\n(\n176Lu/177Hf\n\n)\nsample\n\n?\n(\n\n176Lu/177Hf\n)\n\nDM\n\n+ 1\n\n}\n\nWhereas a single stage TDM age is commonly cal-\n\nculated for whole rock analyses, for zircon studies a two-\n\nstage TDM age is needed (Nebel et al. 2007).\n\nThe TDM age in zircon is calculated from the ini-\n\ntial Hf isotopic composition of the zircon, using an av-\n\nerage crustal Lu/Hf ratio. The initial Hf composition\n\nof zircon represents the 176Hf/177Hf value calculated at\n\nthe time the zircon crystallized, namely the U-Pb age\n\npreviously obtained on the same crystal. Such model\n\nages indicate the crustal residence time for the rocks that\n\nhosted the zircon.\n\nIt is evident the importance to carry out U-Pb and\n\nLu-Hf measurements on the same portion of a zircon\n\ngrain, in order to be able to recalculate the ?Hf and Hf\n\nTDM values at the time of its crystallization.\n\nANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES\n\nINSTRUMENTATION AND LA MC-ICP-MASS\n\nSPECTROMETRY\n\nIn this study we use a Thermo Neptune MC-ICP-MS in-\n\nstrument equipped with an array of eight moveable Fara-\n\nday collectors (L4, L3, L2, L1, H1, H2, H3, H4) and one\n\nfixed center collector (C), which supports a Faraday and\n\na Secondary Electron Multiplier (SEM). The Neptune is\n\nalso equipped with six Multiple Ion Counting (MICs),\n\nfour of these associated to the L4 Faraday and two asso-\n\nciated to the L3 and H4 Faradays, respectively.\n\nAll the measurements were performed in a static\n\nmulti-collection and low mass resolution mode. The Far-\n\nadays configuration for Lu-Hf measurements are shown\n\nin Table I.\n\nStandard Solutions Analyses\n\nIn terms of signal stability, the ICP-MS solution sys-\n\ntem (solution sample) has more accuracy than laser ab-\n\nlation analyses; so, before starting the laser ablation ses-\n\nsions, we routinely calibrate the spectrometer with so-\n\nlutions. For this reason, the first objective in the de-\n\nvelopment of this systematic has been to prepare a Hf\n\nstandard solution.\n\nFor the preparation of the Hf standard solution, the\n\nSRM reference material JMC475, available as oxide \u2013\n\nHfO2, has been used. Firstly, we dissolved 100 mg of\n\nHfO2 oxide in fluorhydric and nitric acid (HF+HNO3)\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (2)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/5/3 \u2014 12:28 \u2014 page 482 \u2014 #4\n\n482 MASSIMO MATTEINI, ELTON L.

Then, we prepared a 1000 ppm\n\nstock solution and, starting from this, a 1 ppm sub-stock\n\nsolution and a 200 ppb solution for analyses have been\n\nproduced.\n\nWith the aim to test the corrections for Lu and Yb\n\nisobaric interference and mass-bias fractionation, a por-\n\ntion of the prepared JMC475 standard solution has been\n\ndoped with a known quantity of Yb and Lu, obtaining a\n\nnew standard solution with Yb/Hf=0.02 and Lu/Hf=0.02.\n\nAt the beginning of each analytical session, the JMC475\n\nstandard solution is ran to calibrate the instrument until\n\nthe reported values of 176Hf/177Hf are achieved.\n\nThe JMC475 isotopic values of Hf reported in the\n\nliterature (Wu et al. 2006, Chu et al. 2002) were repro-\n\nduced within error margins. In Figure 1 a typical result\n\nfor a 240 cycles analysis of JMC475 standard solution\n\nis shown.\n\nLaser Ablation Analyses\n\n\u2014 Sample Preparation\n\nZircons are separated with density and gravimetric meth-\n\nods, and the preparation of polished mounts of epoxy\n\nresin with a number of zircon ranging from 10 to 100,\n\ndepending on the purpose of the analysis, is carried out.\n\nAs explained before, the measurement of Lu-Hf iso-\n\ntopes on zircons is made on a crystal previously analyzed\n\nby laser ablation U-Pb method to obtain age information.\n\nSpatially, the two spot analyses have to be as close as pos-\n\nsible in order to analyze portions of the zircon grain with\n\nthe same isotopic characteristics.\n\nBefore the in situ analysis, we should obtain as more\n\ninformation as possible about the structure of the zircon,\n\nsuch as zoning composition, growth pattern and pres-\n\nence of inherited core. It should prevent to analyses of\n\nportions of the zircon with different Hf and Pb isotopic\n\ncompositions that would generate misleading results.\n\nThe best methods to obtain images of the internal\n\nstructure of zircon on polished surfaces are the Cathodo-\n\nluminescence (CL) and the Back-Scattered Electrons\n\n(BSE) techniques. For the Lu-Hf method, the BSE im-\n\nagery is preferable because the brightness of the image\n\nis atomic mass dependent and, for that, it is possible to\n\neasily discriminate regions with different Hf content in\n\nthe same zircon crystal. Higher brightness in the image\n\ncorresponds to higher Hf contents in the zircon (Han-\n\nchar and Miller 1993, Corfu et al. 2003).\n\n\u2014 Laser Settings\n\nFor U-Pb method, we utilized the laser configuration de-\n\nscribed in B\u00fchn et al. (2009), which employ a a raster\n\nablation generated by a moving laser spot with a diam-\n\neter of 30 ?m. As the raster ablation does not consume\n\nmuch material and produce a low deep hole on the zir-\n\ncon surface, in some case it is possible to do the Lu-Hf\n\nanalyses in the same local of the previous U-Pb analyses.\n\nFor Lu-Hf method, we chose a laser configuration\n\nfollowing the most recent literature (Gerdes and Zeh\n\n2006, 2009). The ablation geometry that we used is a\n\nlaser spot of 40 to 55 ?m (Fig. 2), which, while reduc-\n\ning the spatial resolution, permits to ablate more material\n\nfor a higher signal. To improve the stability of the sig-\n\nnal, we chose a low laser frequency of about 5-7 Hz.\n\nThe power of the laser used during the analytical session\n\ndepends mainly on the Hf contents of the analyzed zir-\n\ncons, especially the standard one. In our case, using th\n\nGJ standard zircon, we used a power of about 40-50%,\n\nwhich corresponds to an energy of 1-3 J/cm2.\n\nHelium flux is used to transport the ablated mate-\n\nrial from the zircon in the sample chamber to the MC-\n\nICP-MS: a flux of about 0.38-0.46 lit/min is utilized de-\n\npending on the values of the other laser parameters.

This zircon\n\nwas provided by the Mineralogy Museum of Pisa Uni-\n\nversity, Italy. For an example of geological application,\n\ntwo complex zircons from a paleoproterozoic migmatite\n\nfrom the Borborema Province were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nU-Pb\n\nThe analyses have been carried out using raster abla-\n\ntion method (B\u00fchn et al. 2009) to prevent laser induced\n\nmass bias fractionation. The U-Pb raw data are trans-\n\nlated to an Excel spreadsheet for data reduction and,\n\nwhen necessary, we corrected the laser induced mass\n\nbias using the method of Ko\u0161ler et al. (2002). Com-\n\nmon lead (204Pb) interference and background correc-\n\ntion, when necessary were carried out by monitoring the\n202Hg and 204 mass (204Hg+204Pb) during the analyti-\n\ncal sessions and using a model Pb composition (Stacey\n\nand Kramers 1975) when necessary. Reported errors\n\nare propagated by quadratic addition\n[\n(2SD2+2SE2)1/2\n\n]\n\nof external reproducibility and within-run precision: the\n\nexternal reproducibility is represented by the standard\n\ndeviation (SD) obtained by repeated analyses (n=20,\n\n? 0.8% for 207Pb/206Pb and ? 1% for 206Pb/238U) of\n\nstandard zircon GJ-1, performed during analytical ses-\n\nsion, and the within-run precision is represented by the\n\nstandard error (SE) that was calculated for each analy-\n\nsis. Concordia diagrams (2? error ellipses), concordia\n\nages and lower and upper intercept ages were calculated\n\nusing Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2001).\n\nLu-Hf\n\nThe acquired Lu and Hf isotope data are corrected on-\n\nline for mass bias fractionation and isobaric interfer-\n\nences. Successively, the isotope ratios are translated to\n\nan Excel spreadsheet, for calculation of the parameters\n\nof geologic interest, as ?Hf and Hf TDM model age. The\n\nsignals of the interference-free isotopes 171Yb, 173Yb\n\nand 175Lu are monitored during the analyses in order\n\nto remove isobaric interferences of 176Yb and 176Lu on\n176Hf signal (Table I). The 176Yb and 176Lu contribu-\n\ntion are calculated using the isotopic abundance of Lu\n\nand Hf proposed by Chu et al. (2002). The contempora-\n\nneous measurements of 171Yb, 173Yb permit to correct\n\nthe mass bias fractionation of Yb using a 173Yb/171Yb\n\nnormalization factor of 1.132685 (Chu et al. 2002). The\n\nHf isotope ratios are normalized to 179Hf/177Hf value\n\nof 0.7325 (Chu et al. 2002). Our routine laser ablation\n\nmeasurements consist of 1 block of 40 cycles with an\n\nintegration time of 1.034 seconds. For solution anal-\n\nyses, 4 blocks of 40 cycles and an integration time of\n\n4 seconds are employed.\n\nThe ?Hf(t) values are calculated using the decay\n\nconstant ? = 1.86 * 10?11, proposed by Scherer et al.\n\n(2001) and the 176Lu/177Hf and 176Hf/177Hf CHUR val-\n\nues of 0.0332 and 0.282772 proposed by Blichert-Toft\n\nand Albar\u00e9de (1997). The two stages depleted mantle\n\nHf model ages (TDM Hf) are calculated using 176Lu/\n177Hf=0.0384 and 176Hf/177Hf=0.28325 for the de-\n\npleted mantle (Chauvel and Blichert-Toft 2001) and\n176Lu/177Hf value of 0.0113 for the average crust (Tay-\n\nlor and McLennan 1985, Wedepohl 1995).\n\nSTANDARD ZIRCON ANALYSES\n\nThe GJ-1 zircon standard has been analyzed over a pe-\n\nriod of about six months. The obtained Hf isotopic\n\ncompositions yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282022\u00b111 (2SD,\n\nn=56), reproducing within the error margins the values\n\nreported in literature by several authors (Elhlou et al.\n\n2006, Zeh et al. 2007). The Temora-2, UQ-Z zircon\n\nstandards and MADA zircon have been analyzed in sev-\n\neral analytical sessions. The obtained results are listed\n\nin Table II. The Temora-2 isotopic composition yielded\n176Hf/177Hf=0.282693\u00b114 (2SD, n=25), in agreement\n\nwith the values reported in the literature by Woodhead\n\net al. (2004), Hawkesworth and Kemp (2006) and Wu et\n\nal. 2006.\n\nThe analyses carried out on the UQ-Z zircons stan-\n\ndard yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282127\u00b133 (2SD, n=11),\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (2)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/5/3 \u2014 12:28 \u2014 page 485 \u2014 #7\n\nLu-Hf IN SITU ANALYSES BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 485\n\nTABLE II\nMean Hf isotopic compositions for zircon standards obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS.\n\nSample 176Lu/177Hf 2? 176Hf/177Hf 2? ?Hf 2?

Before\n\nthe analytical session, the MADA zircon has been previ-\n\nously studied with the BSE technique in order to evalu-\n\nate a possible growth zoning. The BSE image obtained\n\nfor the analyzed grain shows that it is very homoge-\n\nneous in terms of Hf content, do not showing any in-\n\nternal structures. The Hf analyses carried out in differ-\n\nent parts of the grain yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282352\u00b122\n\n(2SD, n=14), suggesting a very homogeneous Hf iso-\n\ntopic composition.\n\nEXAMPLE OF GEOLOGICAL APPLICATION\n\nWe present an application study of the in situ combined\n\nU-Pb and Lu-Hf systematic on zircons with LA-(MC)\n\nICP-MS technique. This study has been chosen to show\n\nthe potential of the Lu-Hf LA-MC-ICP-MS systematic\n\non zircon as a powerful tool for reconstructing the tec-\n\ntonic evolution of a cratonic area.\n\nThe studied zircons have been separated from a leu-\n\ncocratic portion of migmatitic rock from the Rio Grande\n\ndo Norte terrain in the Borborema Province. Images of\n\nthe selected zircons in backscattered electrons (BSE)\n\nmode were obtained using a Scanning Electron Micro-\n\nprobe (SEM) in order to have information on the internal\n\nstructure of the studied zircons. In this contribution, we\n\nemploy the BSE technique using a Scanning Electron\n\nMicroscope (SEM) JOEL of the laboratory of the Fed-\n\neral Police of Bras\u00edlia.\n\nThe BSE images permitted us to differentiate Hf-\n\nrich and Hf-poor portions of zircons, characterized by\n\nhigh and low brightness response, respectively.\n\nThe studied zircons show a typical flat shaped meta-\n\nmorphic morphology and complex internal structures\n\n(Fig. 3), with well developed zoning with an euhedral\n\nHf-rich core rimmed by a Hf-poor rim.\n\nWe analyzed the selected zircons with combined U-\n\nPb and Lu-Hf in situ LA-MC-ICP-MS technique (Ta-\n\nbles III and IV). Every portion of each zircon grains\n\nshowing peculiar and distinctive characteristics based on\n\nthe interpretation of BSE images has been analyzed. Ini-\n\ntial Hf composition for each zircon has been calculated\n\nusing the U-Pb age of the correspondent spot. For old\n\ndiscordant zircons, it was assumed that 207Pb/206Pb age\n\nrepresents the crystallization age, whereas for younger\n\nzircons the 206Pb/238U was considered. The Lu-Hf data\n\nare shown in Table IV.\n\nIn Figure 4 the Concordia diagrams for the obtained\n\ndata on two zircons are shown. The two analyses of zir-\n\ncon 1 (Fig. 4a) define two crystallization events: an older\n\none defined by a 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057\u00b114 Ma, and a\n\nyounger one defined by the concordant age of 578\u00b111.\n\nThe U-Pb analyses on zircon 12 also define (Fig. 4b)\n\ntwo crystallization events individuated by a concordant\n\nanalysis of 2024\u00b111 Ma and a by a slightly discordant\n\nanalyses with 206Pb/238U age of 606\u00b115 Ma. In Fig-\n\nure 4c a graphic interpretation of the slightly discordant\n\nrim data for zircon 12 is shown.\n\nThe distribution of these younger analyses may be\n\ninterpreted in two different ways: i) different extreme\n\nPb-loss of Paleoproterozic grains induced by a 575 Ma\n\nmagmatic event (Dantas et al. 2004) and ii) crystalliza-\n\ntion event at 575 Ma, with discordance for zircon 12\n\nrim possibly caused by an imperfect sample preparation.\n\nIn this case, as shown in Figure 4c, it is possible that\n\nthe laser accidentally ablated a portion of the older core.\n\nThe total signal of such analysis, representing a mix-\n\ning of two different portions of the zircons, would be\n\nplotted on a discordia line defined by the two different\n\n(end-members) U-Pb isotopic compositions.\n\nThe Hf results are listed in Table IV and shown in\n\nthe diagram of Figure 5a-b.

The Hf isotopic\n\ncompositions for three zircon standards have been mea-\n\nsured. The 176Hf/177Hf values for GJ-1 and TEMORA-2\n\nreported in the literature by several authors have been re-\n\nproduced, within error margin. The Lu-Hf isotopic com-\n\nposition for the zircon standard UQ-Z and for a in-house\n\nzircon standard is reported.\n\nNew U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data were obtained\n\nfor two zircons selected from a migmatitic rock from\n\nthe Borborema Province. The U-Pb, Lu Hf in situ anal-\n\nyses, combined with BSE imaging, permitted to study\n\nin detail the internal isotopic composition of the zircons\n\nand to obtain information about the growing history of\n\neach zircon. On the basis of U-Pb and Lu-Hf data, two\n\nmain crystallization events have been identified in both\n\nstudied zircons. An older event at ca. 2.05 Ga that was\n\nrecognized in the core portions of the zircons represents\n\na well characterized Paleoproterozoic magmatic event\n\nthat affected the whole Borborema Province. A second\n\nyounger crystallization event at ? 575 Ma, which gen-\n\nerated the rim portions of the zircons, would represent a\n\nhigh grade metamorphic-magmatic, in agreement with\n\nprevious geochronological data obtained by other au-\n\nthors (Dantas et al. 2004) on monazite (TIMS) from a\n\ngranite outcropping in the same region.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe LA-MC-ICP-MS facility was installed at the Uni-\n\nversity of Bras\u00edlia with funds provided by PETROBRAS\n\nand the Ministry of Minas e Energia of Brazil.
