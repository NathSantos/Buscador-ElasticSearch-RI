Em primeiro lugar, este trabalho tem como \nobjetivo propor uma metodologia capaz de quantificar riscos ecol\u00f3gicos inerentes a eventos \nraros como acidentes industriais. Utiliza-se a modelagem populacional para simular futuras \nmudan\u00e7as na abund\u00e2ncia populacional de esp\u00e9cies-chave em risco e, assim, estimar a \nprobabilidade de extin\u00e7\u00e3o ou decl\u00ednio, tempo para extin\u00e7\u00e3o e outras medidas, para cada \ncen\u00e1rio acidental. Assim, foi poss\u00edvel desenvolver uma abordagem que combina os danos \necol\u00f3gicos (previstos atrav\u00e9s da modelagem populacional) com a frequ\u00eancia de ocorr\u00eancia do \ncen\u00e1rio acidental (estimada atrav\u00e9s de dados hist\u00f3ricos e an\u00e1lise de confiabilidade). O \nresultado \u00e9 uma curva de risco FN (similar ao resultado de uma an\u00e1lise de risco a humanos), \nonde N \u00e9 o decl\u00ednio populacional m\u00e9dio e F a frequ\u00eancia acumulada de acidentes com \ndecl\u00ednio maior ou igual a N. Em segundo lugar, o trabalho apresenta uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da \nmetodologia para quantificar os riscos ecol\u00f3gicos provenientes de acidentes associados ao \ntransporte e manuseio de petr\u00f3leo que abastece uma refinaria no Complexo Industrial \nPortu\u00e1rio de Suape-PE, no Nordeste do Brasil. Esta instala\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 localizada pr\u00f3xima a um \nrico ecossistema aqu\u00e1tico de alta biodiversidade. A popula\u00e7\u00e3o de uma esp\u00e9cie nativa foi \nestrategicamente escolhida para representar o ecossistema, alguns cen\u00e1rios de derramamento \nde petr\u00f3leo foram simulados e suas frequ\u00eancias de ocorr\u00eancia estimadas. Para cada cen\u00e1rio \nacidental, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo que atinge a popula\u00e7\u00e3o foi prevista via modelagem de \ndestino e transporte. Os riscos ecol\u00f3gicos foram quantificados e apresentados em uma curva \nFN. Uma an\u00e1lise de sensibilidade foi feita para explorar como mudan\u00e7as em par\u00e2metros \nespec\u00edficos causam mudan\u00e7as nas medidas de risco. Al\u00e9m disso, a incerteza foi medida como \num intervalo (limite superior e inferior) para as medidas de riscos com base em cen\u00e1rios \npessimistas e otimistas. Finalmente, a metodologia mostrou-se vi\u00e1vel, eficiente, conveniente e \nflex\u00edvel, apesar de que algumas melhorias ainda podem ser feitas e estas foram propostas para \ntrabalhos futuros. \n\n \nPalavras-chave: An\u00e1lise Quantitativa de Risco; An\u00e1lise de Riscos Ecol\u00f3gicos; \n\nAcidentes industriais; Modelagem ecol\u00f3gica. \n  \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRecent industrial accidents such as toxic spills have caused catastrophic damage to \necological environments (plants and animals), so that an effective method to assess ecological \nrisks has been demanded. Firstly, this work aims at proposing a methodology capable of \nquantifying ecological risks related to rare events such as industrial accidents. One uses \npopulation modeling to simulate future changes in the population abundance of key species at \nrisk and therefore estimate the probability of extinction or decline, time to extinction and \nother measures, for each accidental scenario. Thus, it was possible to develop an approach \nthat links the ecological damage (predicted via population modeling) with the frequency of \noccurrence of the accidental scenario (estimated via historical data and reliability analysis). \nThe result is a FN risk curve (similar to the result of a human quantitative risk assessment), \nwhere N is the average population decline number and F the cumulative frequency of \naccidents with N or greater abundance decline. Secondly, the work presents an application of \nthe methodology to quantify ecological risks originating from accidents associated with \ntransport and handling of crude oil to supply an oil refinery in the Suape Port and Industrial \nComplex, in the Northeast of Brazil. This is located near a very rich aquatic ecosystem with a \nhigh biodiversity. A population of a native species was strategically chosen to represent the \necosystem, some scenarios of oil spill were simulated and their frequencies of occurrence \nestimated. For each accidental scenario, the concentration of oil that reaches the population \nwas predicted via fate and transport modeling. The ecological risks were quantified and \npresented as a FN curve. A sensitivity analysis was made to explore how changes on specific \nparameters cause changes in risk measures. Also, uncertainty was measured by estimating a \nrange (lower bound and upper bound) to risk measures based on best case and worst case \nscenarios. Finally, the methodology proved to be practicable, efficient, convenient and \nflexible, although some improvements can still be made and were proposed for future works. \n\n \nKeywords: Quantitative Risk Assessment; Ecological Risk Assessment; Industrial \n\naccidents; Ecological modeling. \n   \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nCONTENTS \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\nThis work is within the field of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA), which has become \n\nan important part of the decision-making process for managing environmental problems [1; 2] \n\nand can be used to evaluate risks to plants and animals as a result of human impact. It has \n\nbeen considered in programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n\n(EPA) and in similar programs administrated by environmental agencies in Canada, Europe, \n\nNew Zealand and Australia. For instance, ERAs has been used in pesticide regulatory \n\nprograms, support in decision-making about waste discharges, and remedial actions to clean \n\nup or treat contaminated areas, and installation of new industrial facilities. This work focuses \n\non the last one, which makes ERA an important field of research within Production \n\nEngineering, since it is particularly useful in industrial establishments for providing \n\ninformation necessary to the processes of licensing, risk management, and environmental \n\nmanagement. \n\nIn general, risk assessment in industrial risk management should deal with risks to the \n\ntotality of the surrounding environment originating from an industrial installation or activity, \n\nincluding the ecological environment (sometimes known as the natural environment), the \n\nhuman health and structures/technology/physical materials. Each one of these entities has \n\nlittle similarity in the variables used to perform a risk assessment, so that they usually need \n\ndistinct methodologies, especially if it is a quantitative assessment. As consequence, ERA has \n\nbecome a particular field of study within the Risk Assessment. This work centers its attention \n\nin ecological risks, which means risks with potential to cause adverse ecological effects, and \n\ndoes not contemplate risks to the human health or to physical materials. In addition, because \n\nfire and explosion are events that usually cause minor ecological damage than toxic spills, we \n\nfocus on threats caused by toxic spills, although the former can be treated as initiator events of \n\nthe latter. \n\nWith regard to current studies in the field of ERA, most of them (e.g., [2; 3; 4]) focus on \n\nrisks caused by chronic interference (continuous and persistent) such as, for example, waste \n\ndischarge, so that there is a missing link between ecological risks and industrial accidents. For \n\nthat reason, this work falls within the context of ERA for industrial accidents, i.e. it deals with \n\n(rare) events with low frequency of occurrence but that may cause catastrophic damage. For \n\nthe purposes of this work, rare events are defined as events that happen less than once per \n\nyear. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nIn the recent Brazilian context, ERAs for toxic spills rely on subjective rules-of-thumb \n\nor opinions [5]. In other words, it is usually done by the comparison of the estimated \n\nconcentration of the toxic substance in an ecosystem with reference values given by \n\ntoxicological information, such as the Toxicological Information Sheet (TIS) provided by \n\nCETESB [5]. Therefore, this work focuses on quantitative assessments (i.e. estimate of \n\nquantitative values to the ecological risks related to accidents), in an effort to provide \n\nnumerical basis to decisions in environmental and risk management. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the proposed methodology in this work was already \n\npublished in the European Safety and Reliability Association Annual Conference, ESREL \n\n2011 [6]. Also, an extended abstract of the application example of this work was accepted to \n\nbe presented as oral presentation in the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) 2011 Annual \n\nMeeting [7]; and a paper about an improved version of the proposed methodology was \n\naccepted to be published in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSAM) 11 &amp; ESREL 2012 \n\nAnnual Conference [8], the major international event in probabilistic risk assessment in 2012. \n\n1.1 Rationale and Contribution \n\nRecent industrial accidents such as toxic spills have cause catastrophic damage to the \n\nenvironment and consequently great economic losses to the responsible company. That is \n\nwhat British Petroleum (BP) painfully learned after the oil spill on April 20 of 2010, with the \n\nexplosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico, causing one of the most \n\nsevere ecological disasters in history and a loss for the company estimated at 37 billion \n\ndollars to be spent on cleanup, fines and repairs. However, this leak could have been avoided \n\nwith the purchase of an equipment of U$500,000, able to seal the well in case of accident. \n\nThis resulted in a loss 74,000 times higher to BP, not counting the corporate image \n\ndegradation and the loss in the value of its shares [9]. \n\nSeveral others dramatic industrial accidents have also occurred in recent years, resulting \n\nin the discharge of chemicals and damaging valuable ecosystems [10; 11; 12; 13]. For \n\ninstance, the wrecks of the oil tankers Rena (2011), Prestige (2002) and Erika (1999); and the \n\nchemical spills at Do\u00f1ana (Spain) in 1998 and Baia Mare (Romania) in 2000. Table 1 presents \n\na summary of recent accidents in the world, whereas Table 2 presents accidents in Brazil. \n\nBesides these, a high number of less harmful incidents happen every year [11]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Recent most severe industrial accidents worldwide. \n\nIndustrial Accident Event Year Location Impact \nMarine oil spill by a stricken \ncontainer ship \n\n2011 Coast of New \nZealand \n\nAbout 350 tonnes of oil into the sea. Oil \nhas washed up along about 60 \nkilometers of the coast. Nearly 1,300 \nbirds have died in the spill. It is seen as \nNew Zealand\u2019s worst environmental \ndisaster in decades.  \n\nExplosion in the Deep Water \nHorizon platform \n\n2010 Gulf of Mexico Death of 11 people, more than 600 \nendangered species. \n\nMarine oil spill by the tanker \nPrestige \n\n2002 Coast of Spain More than 35,000 tonnes spilled, with a \nsimilar amount left inside the sunken \ntanker. Almost 20,000 birds found dead, \nseveral hundred kilometers of coast \npolluted in Spain and France. \n\nChemical spill \ncaused by rupture of a \ndam at a mining \ncompany Aznalc\u00f3llar \n\n1998 Guadiamar river, \nDonana National \nPark (Spain) \n\nEnormous environmental impact: 3 600 \nhectares of cropland destroyed, 12 \ntonnes of dead fish collected. \n\nSpill of almost 100,000 cubic \nmeters of polluted \nwater caused by \nthe break of a dam at the \nmining \ncompany AURUL SA SC \n\n2000 Region of Baia \nMare in \nnorthwestern \nRomania \n\nMore than 1,000 km of contaminated \narea; hundreds of tonnes of fish killed; \ndrinking water supply was interrupted in \n24 locations, affecting over 2.5 million \npeople. \n\nMarine oil spill by the tanker \nErika \n\n1999 Atlantic coast of \nFrance \n\n20,000 tonnes of oil spilled, 400 km of \ncoast polluted, 45,000 birds found dead. \n\nMarine oil spill by the tanker \nExxon Valdez \n\n1989 Coast of Alaska About 100 million birds killed and 2,000 \nkilometers of contaminated coast, about \n2% of the oil spilled is \nstill polluting the area. \n\nExplosion of one of the \nfour reactors at Chernobyl \n\n1986 Ukraine High radiation released and nuclear \ncloud; immediate death of 32 people, \nother 10,000 died in the following \nyears; contamination of \nthousands of forests; diseases in more \nthan 40 000 people. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Recent most severe industrial accidents in Brazil. \n\nIndustrial Accident Event Year Location Impact \nMarine oil spill caused by the \nexplosion of the tanker Vicu\u00f1a \n\n2000 Porto f \nParanagu\u00e1, PR \n\nAbout 1.5 million liters of oil spilled, \naffecting much of the bay, including \nenvironmental preservation areas. \n\nOil spill caused by the rupture \nof a pipeline expansion joint \nin the refinery Getulio Vargas \n\n2000 Rivers Birigui and \nIgua\u00e7u, PR \n\nAbout 4 million liters of oil spilled into \nthe Rivers, causing the greatest \nenvironmental disaster with oil in Brazil. \n\nOil spill caused by a leaking \nunderwater pipeline in the oil \nrefinery Duque de Caxias \n\n2000 Ba\u00eda de \nGuanabara, Rio \nde Janeiro, Brazil \n\nAt least 1.3 million liters of oil spilled, \n40 km\u00b2 of bay polluted, damaging large \nswaths of mangrove ecosystem. Among \nthe 12 spills occurred in the Bay, this \nwas considered the most serious. \n\nOil spill caused by a leaking \nunderwater pipeline in the oil \nrefinery Duque de Caxias \n\n1997 Ba\u00eda de \nGuanabara, Rio \nde Janeiro, Brazil \n\nSpill of 2.8 million liters of oil, reaching \n4,000 m\u00b2 of mangroves in the Bay. \n\nOil spill caused by a breaking \npipeline \n\n1994 Coast of S\u00e3o \nPaulo, S\u00e3o \nSebasti\u00e3o, SP \n\nSpill of 2.7 million liters of oil, polluting \nbeaches and headlands of four \nmunicipalities. \n\nMarine oil spill by the tanker \nMarina \n\nMarch 1985 Coast of S\u00e3o \nPaulo, S\u00e3o \nSebasti\u00e3o, SP \n\nAbout 2.5 million liters of oil spilled, \naffecting bays, inlets, beaches, rocky \nshores and research areas. \n\n \n\nIt can be seen that most accidents are caused by oil spills originated from transport and \n\nhandling activities in the ocean. In fact, according to the database of the International Tanker \n\nOwners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF), it is estimated that from 1970 to 2005, about \n\n5.7 million tons of oil were discharged into the sea [14]. It is also estimated that about \n\n700,000 tonnes/year of crude oil and its derivatives are dumped into aquatic environments \n\n[15], and the time to recover coastal environments that have been impacted by crude oil can \n\nvary from four to one hundred years [15]. Particularly in Brazil, there were about 30 serious \n\naccidents with oil spill between 1990 and 2000 [11]. Also, as the global demand for oil grows \n\n[16], so does the quantity of this product and its derivatives being produced, processed, stored \n\nand transported, and consequently increases the potential to cause serious ecological damage. \n\nThe high frequency of industrial accidents, the increasing potential for damage, and the \n\ncurrent need for sustainable development suggest that preventive measures must be improved, \n\nand the risk assessment is the groundwork for any plan to implement preventive measures. In \n\nthis sense, the greatest contribution of a QERA is to provide information to maximize the \n\nefficiency of risk management measures. Miscalculating risks leads to inefficiency, i.e. \n\nunderestimating them may lead to inadequate risk management to control and prevent adverse \n\neffects to the ecological environment, whereas overestimating them lead to waste of resources \n\nto mitigate apparent problems that are not really important. \n\nThere are several other benefits of a QERA for establishments that handle hazardous \n\nsubstances [2; 17]: \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n\u2022 allows to systematically identify the existing ecological risks, leading to an \n\nimproved level of preparation to emergencies; \n\n\u2022 allows to examine the population dynamics of native species in surrounding \n\necosystems; \n\n\u2022 it is an iterative process, so that new information can be incorporated into risk \n\nassessments in order to improve the results; \n\n\u2022 it can be used to express changes in the ecological risks as a function of changes \n\nin preventive measures or changes in the project of the establishment. This \n\ncapability may be particularly useful to the decision maker who must evaluate \n\ntradeoffs, examine different alternatives, or determine the extent to which risk \n\nmust be reduced to achieve a given outcome; \n\n\u2022 it can deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers \n\non a quantitative basis; \n\n\u2022 it can deal with environmental variability (i.e. natural variation of environmental \n\nconditions in time and space); \n\n\u2022 allows the quantification of risks, which provides a basis for comparing, ranking \n\nand prioritizing risks. It can also be useful in cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness \n\nanalyses related to the alternative management options to the reduction of risk; \n\n\u2022 provides numerical basis of knowledge for communicating the risks to \n\nstakeholders; \n\n\u2022 provides relevant information to tackle many key gaps in environmental \n\nmanagement, such as optimal resource allocation for monitoring affected areas, \n\noptimal management of threatened and endangered species, and spatial planning \n\nfor landscape restoration and management; \n\n\u2022 the assessment may aggregate value to the product of the organization, by being \n\npromoted as sustainable policy. \n\nTo help improve the consistency and quality of QERA, some methodologies have been \n\ndeveloped. EPA provides a detailed guide to the process of ERA [2], but they consider risks \n\ncaused by almost surely events only (e.g., use of pesticides, waste discharge, chronic \n\npollution), i.e. events that happen with probability one and usually cause minor ecological \n\ndamage. They do not contemplate industrial accidents, i.e. (rare) events with low frequency of \n\noccurrence but that may cause catastrophic damage. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nCamacho [17] proposes a methodology named Quantitative Environmental Risk \n\nAssessment. This integrates a methodology to analyze the risk of industrial accidents with \n\nanother methodology to analyze the potential of chemical effects on not only the wildlife (i.e. \n\necological risks), but also on others environmental components: humans and economy. \n\nHowever, he presents no definitive procedures for quantifying ecological risks. Actually, in \n\nthe case study of his work, he considers only effects to the human health, so that the \n\nenvironment is limited to human-beings and the application of his methodology falls in the \n\ncase of standard human Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) methodology [18]. \n\nThe previous methodologies have a common limitation: the missing link between \n\necological risks and industrial accidents. In order to tackle this limitation, Stam et al. proposes \n\na model to assess risk for the aquatic ecological environment related to industrial installations \n\n[19]. This model, called PROTEUS, considers both a probabilistic approach for industrial \n\naccidents (particularly industrial spills) and adverse ecological effects. The former is \n\ncalculated based on standard QRA methodology [18] and uses correction factors needed in \n\norder to assess the risk from an activity under local circumstances. The latter is calculated as a \n\nvolume of potentially contaminated surface water separately for (1) toxic effects, (2) lack of \n\noxygen and (3) formation of a floating layer, and selecting the maximum of these effects.  \n\nHowever, PROTEUS predicts a volume of potentially contaminated water for \n\nrepresenting ecological effects, but the presence of a certain quantity of contaminant does not \n\nnecessarily mean relevant ecological risk [20]. For this reason, one relevant drawback of \n\nPROTEUS cannot be ignored: it fails to directly and explicitly quantify impacts on ecological \n\nentities (such as populations). For example, the toxic effects are estimated by the inaccurate \n\napproach that simply compares the predicted concentration with a toxicity threshold (effect \n\nconcentration, EC50) for algae, arthropods or fish, i.e. the hazard quotient approach (section \n\n2.4 provides more information about this limitation). Furthermore, even though a volume of \n\npotentially contaminated water is calculated, it is hard to determine if the risk is significant or \n\nnot, because each specific aquatic ecosystem has its specific response to a certain \n\ncontaminated water volume, so that QERAs with PROTEUS need a qualitative evaluation of \n\nat the end. In summary, the results of PROTEUS are not directly useful for risk managers and \n\nstakeholders. They still need a subjective evaluation of ecologists before being presented. \n\nAs a way around these shortcomings, the main contribution of this work is to provide a \n\nmethodology that considers both the accident\u2019s frequency and the magnitude of the adverse \n\necological effects. The proposed methodology is capable of quantifying ecological risks \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\ncaused by events with low frequency of occurrence and catastrophic consequences. It focus \n\non ecological impacts. Moreover, it uses mathematical modeling applied to ecology (i.e. \n\npopulation modeling [3; 20]) to extrapolate toxicological effects on individual organisms to \n\npopulation-level effects (e.g. effects on abundance or growth rate). The Figure 1.1 illustrates \n\nthe main goal of the proposed methodology, which is to integrate data on four different \n\nstudies that provide relevant information to understand ecological risks related to industrial \n\naccidents, i.e.: fate and transport models that describe and predict the dispersion and \n\nconcentration of chemicals in the water, air, or soil; reliability analysis to estimate accidents\u2019 \n\nfrequencies of occurrence; ecotoxicology that provides individual-level effects as a function \n\nof toxic exposure; and ecological modeling that translates individual-level into population-\n\nlevel effects. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Proposed methodology as a means of integrating data from several fields of study \nthat provide relevant information for ecological risk quantification. \n\nAgain and again, the proposed methodology is not limited to assess ecological damage \n\nto individuals (individual-level effects), that often leads to inaccurate risk estimates and thus \n\nerrors in environmental and risk management decisions. The methodology makes use of \n\necological modeling in risk assessment [3; 20], that explicitly quantify impacts on ecological \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nentities and can provide a more powerful basis for expressing ecological risks. This way, it \n\nincorporates population modeling in order to predict the responses of population to toxic \n\nexposure (population-level effects) and taking into account the relationships between \n\nindividuals, the life history and ecology of a native species in the surrounding ecosystem. \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\n1.2.1 General objective \n\nTo propose a methodology for quantitative risk assessment for industrial accidents with \n\npotential to cause adverse effects on ecological environments, i.e. plants and animals \n\n(excluding people, pets and physical materials). \n\n1.2.2 Specific objectives \n\n\u2022 To select and integrate ideas, possibilities, methods and guidelines that could \n\nimprove the process of quantifying ecological risks; \n\n\u2022 To propose the quantification of the frequency of occurrence of accidental \n\nscenarios via reliability analysis; \n\n\u2022 To propose exposure and consequence assessment (e.g. fate and transport \n\nmodeling, exposure-response assessment, population modeling)  as means of \n\ndescribing the ecological damage (i.e. quantifying the magnitude of the \n\nconsequences) caused by accidental toxic spills; \n\n\u2022 To contemplate both the frequency of occurrence and consequences in a single \n\nrisk measure; \n\n\u2022 To divide the methodology into steps and describe them in details; \n\n\u2022 To employ worst-case criteria throughout the proposed methodology to screen \n\nout accidental scenarios that have insignificant contribution to the final \n\necological risk, thus avoiding waste of resources and time; \n\n\u2022 To build a comprehensive scheme that illustrates the steps and criteria in \n\nconducting the methodology; \n\n\u2022 To justify all assumptions and criteria of the methodology; \n\n\u2022 To test the efficiency and practicability of the methodology by applying it to \n\nconduct a QERA in an industrial activity that deals with huge amounts of toxic \n\nchemicals, i.e. activities of transport and handling of crude oil to supply the \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nAbreu e Lima oil refinery (RNEST), to be constructed within the Suape Port and \n\nIndustrial Complex (SPIC), in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. \n\n1.3 Expected results \n\nIt is expected that the methodology will be capable of effectively quantifying ecological \n\nrisks (at population-level) caused by accidental toxic spills. More specifically, it is expected \n\nthat the methodology should: \n\n\u2022 Make predictions that are relevant to environmental and risk management; \n\n\u2022 Provide information that allows the comparison among accidental scenarios, as a \n\nbasis for prioritizing risk management actions under limited resources; \n\n\u2022 Provide a single risk measure that summarizes the ecological risks originating \n\nfrom accidents in a hazardous industrial activity, as simple way of \n\ncommunicating to stakeholders the total ecological risks; \n\n\u2022 Deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers on a \n\nquantitative basis; \n\n\u2022 Deal with environmental variability in time and space; \n\n\u2022 Be convenient and practicable in terms of costs, time and data needs. \n\n1.4 Structure of the work \n\nThis work is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents a review of the theoretical \n\nbackground for understanding this work. Chapter 3 presents the proposed methodology and \n\nexplains how it can tackle limitations of other methodologies. Chapter 4 aims at validating the \n\nproposed methodology. It consists of an application of the methodology to perform a QERA \n\nin an industrial activity. Lastly, chapter 5 is concerned with the concluding remarks, i.e. the \n\nmost important goals and limitations of the methodology, practical implications of the results, \n\nconclusions taken from the application example and future developments.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n2 THEORETICAL BASIS \n\n2.1 Basic Concepts of Ecology \n\nEcology is the science that studies the relations of living beings with one another and \n\nwith the environment in which they live as well as their reciprocal influences, including the \n\nhuman aspects that affect and interact with the natural systems of the planet [21].  \n\nFor the purposes of this work, it is important to be clear about the definitions of \n\nenvironment and ecological environment. In accordance with EPA, environment is \u201cthe sum \n\nof all external conditions affecting the life, development and survival of an organism\u201d [22]. \n\nSo environment encompasses humans, physical materials and the ecological environment \n\nitself (i.e. wildlife plants and animals). \n\nAs stated previously, ecology studies the relations of living organisms to each other and \n\nto the environment. The biological world is very complex, so it was divided into biological \n\nhierarchy levels, as shown in Figure 2.1. The ecology studies only from individual organism \n\nlevel to higher levels and EPA provides definitions to these [22]: \n\n\u2022 Organism refers to \u201cany form of animal or plant life\u201d. \n\n\u2022 Population refers to \u201ca group of interbreeding organisms occupying a particular \n\nspace\u201d. Each population has its own characteristics such as abundance, birth rate \n\n(fecundity), deaths rate (mortality), age distribution, dispersion, growth rate. \n\n\u2022 Community refers to \u201can assemblage of populations of different species within a \n\nspecified location in space and time. Sometimes, a particular subgrouping may \n\nbe specified, such as the fish community in a lake or the soil arthropod \n\ncommunity in a forest\u201d.  \n\n\u2022 Ecosystem refers to \u201cthe interacting system of a biological community and its \n\nnon-living environmental surroundings\u201d. \n\n\u2022 And landscape refers to \u201cthe traits, patterns, and structure of a specific \n\ngeographic area, including its biological composition, its physical environment, \n\nand its anthropogenic or social patterns. An area where interacting ecosystems \n\nare grouped and repeated in similar form\u201d. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Hierarchy of biological endpoints. \n(From the ref. [3]) \n\nBy the way, habitats used by most species around industrial sites are becoming \n\nincreasingly fragmented by human activities and, consequently, several distinct populations of \n\nsame species are living spatially separated, in spite of interacting at some level (e.g. exchange \n\nof individuals). In fact, there are relatively few cases where the entire population resides \n\nwithin a same area. Hence, most species are distributed across space as a large population of \n\nconnected subpopulations, that is, as a metapopulation. According to Pastorok et al., \u201ca \n\nmetapopulation is a set of populations of the same species in the same general geographic area \n\nwith a potential for migration among them\u201d [3]. \n\nWith regard to levels lower than individual organisms, i.e. organ, tissue, cell and \n\nmolecule, they can be biomarkers. These are measures of body fluids, cells, tissues or \n\nmeasures taken on the whole organism, which indicate (in biochemical, cellular, \n\nphysiological, compartmental or energetic terms) the presence of contaminants or the \n\nmagnitude of the response of the target organism [23]. Still, the National Institute of \n\nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) states that \u201cbiomarkers play an important role in \n\nunderstanding the relationships between exposure to environmental chemicals, the \n\ndevelopment of chronic human diseases, and the identification of subgroups that are at \n\nincreased risk for disease\u201d [24]. \n\nAll these explanations complement each other and help to understand that ERA can be \n\nconducted at all levels within the biological hierarchy (including biomarkers). Nevertheless, \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nthe methodology proposed in this work focus on population- and metapopulation-level risks, \n\ni.e. the potential for adverse effects on (meta)populations. Readers are referred to the \n\nreference [3] for models that are potentially useful for risk assessment at higher-levels and to \n\na series of four papers, commissioned by the European Science Foundation [25; 26; 27; 28], \n\nfor the use of biomarkers in ERA. \n\n2.1.1 Ecotoxicology \n\nThe term ecotoxicology was proposed in 1969 by the toxicologist Ren\u00e9 Truhaut during \n\na meeting of the Committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions, in Stockholm. \n\nAccording to Truhaut, ecotoxicology is defined as \"the branch of toxicology concerned with \n\nthe study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of \n\necosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context\u201d [29]. \n\nIn the 1960s, based on acute toxicity tests results, the Water Quality Act \u2013 USA \n\nestablished the first water quality standards in order to protect the aquatic life. In the same \n\nperiod, researches were developed focusing on the selection of sensitive and representative \n\norganisms of the aquatic environment and on the cultivation of organisms in laboratory. In the \n\nsame decade, the book Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson, was published. It was widely \n\nread and began to diffuse to the public concerns about pesticides and environment pollution. \n\nIn the book, she calls attention to the harming and killing of not only animals and birds but \n\nalso humans caused by the uncontrolled and unexamined pesticide use. \n\nThroughout 1970s, some American researchers noticed that limits established for many \n\ntoxic agents separately could not preserve, effectively, the water quality necessary to maintain \n\nthe aquatic life. With this in mind, the aquatic toxicology had a rapid development due to the \n\nknowledge of complex liquid effluents toxicity and the interactions between toxic agents in \n\neffluents and its effects on aquatic biota. Besides that, sophisticated systems were developed \n\nin order to conduct acute and chronic toxicity tests, using fish eggs and larvae to evaluate the \n\ntoxic effects of chemical substances on different life stages of organisms. [30] \n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, validation studies of laboratory toxicity tests and collected \n\naquatic water field data results showed the importance of selecting representative species of to \n\nevaluate toxic effects on an ecosystem. Afterwards, the implementation of ecotoxicology tests \n\nwas intensified for the establishment of water quality standards. [30] \n\nNowadays, the ecotoxicology plays an important role in ERA because it provides basis \n\nof knowledge about toxic effects on individual organisms caused by chemical exposure as \n\nwell as about the representative species in an ecosystem. Knowledge on individual-level \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\neffects is essential to predict higher-level effects such as on population abundance (or \n\ndensity), on community species richness, on productivity, or on distributions of organisms. \n\nLikewise, because the assessment of all species of an ecosystem would require huge costs and \n\nlong time, knowledge on which are representative species is necessary to make the assessment \n\ntractable. \n\n2.1.2 Population dynamics \n\nPopulation dynamics is an ecology discipline which studies changes in the population \n\nabundance. These studies are important to analyze and understand what happens to the \n\npopulation in natural conditions (without chemical exposure). Incidentally, population models \n\nare used to predict and simulate the dynamics of a population. This section will introduce the \n\nmain components in population dynamics, whereas section 2.5 will present a comprehensive \n\noverview of population modeling.  \n\nThe populations that constitute an ecosystem are open systems, i.e., they exchange \n\nenergy and matter with the external environment. Hence, any attempt to describe and predict a \n\npopulation dynamics requires knowledge about the interactions between: (i) system \n\ncomponents, i.e., organisms which compound the population and (ii) the system and the \n\nexternal environment [21]. In view of that, to characterize the dynamics of a population it is \n\nnecessary to define its survival, mortality and fecundity, as well as migration, foraging \n\nbehavior and density-dependence when appropriate. \n\n Firstly, survival means the number of individuals in a population that are alive after a \n\ngiven period of time and the survival rate indicates the proportion. Pastorok et. al. [3] defines \n\nthe age-specific survival rate ???\t(?)? as \u201cthe proportion of individuals present in a given year (?)\twithin a given age class (\t) that survives into the next age class (\t + 1) in the following \nyear (? + 1)\u201d. Age-specific survival rates can be estimated by the equation below: \n\n??(?) = \n???(? + 1)/\n?(?)        (2.1) \nWhere \n\n??(?) = survival rate of individuals in age classe i at time ? \n???(? + 1) = number of individuals in age class (\t + 1) at time (? + 1) \n?(?) = number of individuals in age class (\t) at time (?) \nIn face of that, mortality is the number of individuals of a population that died in a \n\ngiven period of time. The death rate can be expressed as 1-??(?). \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nWith regard to fecundity (F), by definition, it means \u201cthe number of live offspring per \n\nindividual in a given age class that will survive to be counted in the first age class\u201d [31]. \n\nIncidentally, calculating fecundity depends on the available data and two brief examples \n\nmight clarify it. On the one hand, e.g., for oviparous animals, fecundity can be estimated by \n\nthe equation: \n\n? = ???????\t????\t???\t??????? \u00d7 ??? !?!\t?\t?\" ?\t?????\t$?? \u00d7 ??? !?!\t?\t?\"\t ?\t?????\t$????%\t%\t$?\t? \t???\t0\t\"????,   (2.2) \nwhere the probability of hatching and the probability of hatching surviving to age 0 year are \n\nempirically derived species-specific value between 0 and 1. In this case, it is not enough to \n\nderive F on the basis of knowledge about only the actual number of eggs laid, i.e. one has to \n\ninclude the probability of hatching and the probability that the newly hatched fry will survive \n\nuntil the next census to recruit into age class 0. \n\nOn the other hand, if sufficient data is available, fecundity can be estimated by the \n\nequation: \n\n?'()\t?(?) = ? *+,*,+-?,.\t,/\t'()\t0\t1)'+\t234).?5)6\t-7'-\t8)+)\t*+,93:)9\t;1\t?.9?4?93'56\t?.\t'()\t:5'66\t?\t'-\t-?<)\t-?\u00d7=>?@ABC\tDE\tF?GB>HIBJ\tKL\tLH@B\t-?? M.3<;)+\t,/\t?.9?4?93'56\t?.\t'()\t:5'66\t?\t'-\t-?<)\t-  (2.3) \nIn an effort to estimate survival and fecundity, field data need to be collected. \n\nDetermining survival rates requires a minimum of two consecutive yearly field censuses; in \n\nfact, the results will be more reliable if data from three of more consecutive years are \n\navailable. In addition to that, Pauwels suggests that the censuses should be consecutive to \n\nfollow the age classes from one year to the next and to estimate age-specific survival rates, \n\nbut if data for the target species are insufficient then one could extrapolate the information \n\nfrom the related species to the target species [31]. \n\nLet us now examine features concerning the movement of a population, i.e. migration \n\nand foraging behavior. The term migration denotes the movement of all or part of a \n\npopulation from one habitat to another [32]. Incidentally, it is the main way of interaction \n\nbetween populations within a metapopulation. \n\nForaging behavior consists in all methods used by an organism to acquire and utilize \n\nsources of energy and nutrients. This encompasses location, storage, consumption and \n\nretrieval of resources. Moreover, the foraging theory tries to predict how an animal would \n\nchoose to forage within its habitat, considering the knowledge of competition, predation risk, \n\nand resource availability [33]. The larger the foraging area, more food will be available. In \n\ncontrast, the organism will spend more energy and take more risk, since the exposure to \n\npredators in areas beyond its natural habitat will be greater. It is important to emphasize that \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nthe population foraging area should be considered in a QERA when the spatial structure of the \n\nenvironment has important effects on the population dynamics. \n\nAnother very important mechanistic process within the population dynamics is its \n\nregulation via density dependence on survival, mortality, fecundity and movement of \n\npopulations. It is the phenomenon of population growth rate depending on the current \n\npopulation density (or abundance). In other words, according to Ak\u00e7akaya, density \n\ndependence \u201cis any non-constant relationship between population growth rate and the current \n\npopulation size\u201d [34].  \n\nAs is observed in wildlife populations, they are often changing in size, but fluctuating \n\naround an equilibrium abundance for long time periods, unless a disturbance occurs (e.g. \n\npollution, harvest, culling, poaching, catastrophe, etc.). Consequently, it is important to \n\nincorporate density dependence to describe a population dynamics because it causes the \n\npopulation to reach a stationary state (which may fluctuate due to stochasticity only). The \n\nequilibrium abundance is also known as the carrying capacity. In other words, as stated by \n\nAk\u00e7akaya, \u201cthe carrying capacity is the level of abundance above which the population tends \n\nto decline\u201d [35]. \n\nThere are many possible mechanisms that yield density dependence: fecundity may \n\ndecrease, mortality may increase with competition for limited resources, the crowded \n\nconditions may lead to social strife or cannibalisms. Population growth may also be affected \n\nnegatively as population size reach very low levels. This phenomenon, arising from Allee \n\neffects [36; 37], draws a small population away from the carrying capacity and toward \n\nextinction. \n\nUsually, to enhance population growth, density dependence factors decrease mortality, \n\nincrease fecundity, decrease emigration, or increase immigration (i.e. positive density \n\ndependence). By contrast, to retard population growth, they increase mortality, decrease \n\nfecundity, increase emigration, or decrease immigration (i.e. negative density dependence). A \n\nbrief example can clarify the concept of density-dependence: on the one hand, when there are \n\ntoo many organisms living in the same space and being part of the same population, food may \n\nbecome less available and competition among the individuals starts. Consequently, negative \n\ndensity dependence manifests itself (e.g., more individuals dying and emigrating) so that the \n\nabundance will decrease to a quantity in which food is sufficient for all individuals again. \n\nTo conclude, another fundamental component of a population dynamics is the natural \n\nvariability in all its components. In other words, changes in survival, fecundity, migration and \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\ncarrying capacity may occur in an unpredictable fashion. For this reason, any attempt to \n\ndescribe a population dynamics should account for stochasticity in those parameters to better \n\nrepresent reality. Section 2.5.2  and section 2.5.3 provide guidance on how to model density \n\ndependence and on how to account for stochasticity, respectively. \n\n2.2 Risk, Hazard, Threat, Control Measure, Recovery Measure, Consequences \n\nand Accidental Scenario \n\nThere are many definitions of risk in the literature, some are complementary, some are \n\nsupplementary and others are even antagonistic. Each area of knowledge seeks to give its \n\nspecific meaning; therefore there is no uniformity neither in the interpretations of risk nor in \n\nthe methodologies to risk assessment. \n\nCamacho [17] transcribes the several definitions of risk which were the theme of \n\ndiscussion and decision of the SRA Committee on Definitions held in San Diego in 1987, \n\nentitled \u201cDefining Risk\u201d. It is presented a definition that is considered necessary and \n\nsufficient for the interpretation of risk in this work: the American Institute of Chemical \n\nEngineers (AIChE) defines risk as a measure of human injury, ecological damage or \n\neconomic loss in terms of both the accident likelihood and the magnitude of the consequences \n\n[38].  \n\nAs this work focuses on ecological risks, the magnitude of the consequences regards \n\necological damage and is quantified as a measure of time and population probability of \n\nextinction (or decline). This measure is widely accepted and used by the scientific community \n\nin ERA as well as is the quantitative measure used by the International Union for \n\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) to classify plants and animals at risk [39]. \n\nHowever, from an economical point of view, this measure does not completely value \n\nthe magnitude of the consequences in terms of undesirability. Utility theory is used to value \n\nan unwanted event and so provide the most objective and relevant measure that a decision \n\nmaker could have to rationally take decisions while exposed to uncertainty. Describing an \n\nunwanted event in terms of time and population probability of extinction (or decline) consists \n\nof about 80% of the efforts needed to value such an event in terms of undesirability. To whom \n\nit may concern, Campello [40] presents the new methods for assigning value to undesirable \n\nevents, including a measure of risk aversion. \n\nTo the purposes of this work, on the one hand, is the likelihood of occurrence of an \n\naccidental scenario and, on the other, is the measured consequence of this scenario in terms of \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\ntime and population extinction (or decline). The former is estimated using historical records \n\nand reliability analysis techniques (e.g. event tree, Event Sequence Diagrams, Bayesian Belief \n\nNetworks) and it may involve both equipment failures and human errors. The latter is \n\npredicted via exposure and consequence assessment (e.g. fata and transport modeling, \n\nexposure-response assessment, population modeling). \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this work to provide guidance on reliability analysis; for a \n\ngeneral view on reliability theory, models, methods and applications, see the references [41; \n\n42; 43]; and for specific information about techniques such as Event Sequence Diagrams \n\n(ESD), Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) and Human Reliability Analysis, see the references \n\n[44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49]. Likewise, human damage are not within the context of this work; for \n\nmethods to calculate the vulnerability and consequence on human health see the references \n\n[18; 50]. \n\nIt is also important to differentiate between the terms hazard and risk. The former is a \n\npotential source of damage whereas the latter is the combination of the likelihood of \n\noccurrence of damage and the severity of that damage (in defined circumstances). For \n\nexample, on the one hand, a great volume of oil under pressure has potential to cause damage, \n\nso it is a hazard. On the other hand, overpressure may cause an oil spill with defined \n\ncircumstances (such as total mass released, time of spill, hydraulic flow) and cause a \n\nparticular damage that can be measured. The combination of the oil spill\u2019s likelihood of \n\noccurrence with the magnitude of the damage characterizes the risk. \n\nConcerning threats, control and recovery measures, and consequences, Figure 2.2 is a \n\nvery interesting way of illustrating it. As already mentioned, hazard is a potential source of \n\ndamage (usually in the form of energy). Threats are the initiator events which could cause the \n\nhazard to be released, although hazard and threats are sometimes taken to mean the same. \n\nControl measures (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops) are barriers and \n\npreventive actions which can control the threats and avoid the occurrence of the top event, so \n\nthat they reduce the top event\u2019s frequency of occurrence and so reduce the risk. The top event \n\nis actually the accident. Recovery measures (e.g. re-routing of spills, burning the oil before it \n\nreaches an ecosystem, pollution remediation, habitat protection, translocation or \n\nreintroduction of individuals in the population) are mitigation actions which could reduce the \n\nmagnitude of the consequences and so reduce the risk. Consequences are the damage, \n\nimpacts, or effects. Importantly, preventive measures include both control and recovery \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nmeasures. And finally, an accidental scenario is consolidated by defined circumstances to all \n\nthis factors. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 - The bow tie that represents the relationships between hazards, threats, controls, \ntop event, recovery measures and consequences. \n\n(From the ref. [51]) \n\nLastly, there are two types of toxic risks: risk to human health and ecological risk. The \n\nformer refers to the potential that adverse effects to the human health may occur or are \n\noccurring due to exposure to a toxic substance. The latter refers to the potential that adverse \n\necological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to a toxic substance. \n\n2.3 Quantitative Risk Assessment \n\nA Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) allows the quantification of risks, concerning \n\nsince the frequent incidents with small impacts to even the rare events with major \n\nconsequences. Thus, the QRA is necessary for objective decision making related to the \n\nsecurity of the establishment, surrounding communities and ecological environment. The \n\nmajor motivation of carrying out a QRA is that in order to optimize risk management \n\nmeasures, they should be taken based on the results of a QRA. \n\nIn other words, the QRA is used to demonstrate the risks caused by the establishment \n\nand thus help to prioritize which risks require some sort of action and in the decision to \n\nchoose between different actions to reduce those risks. The actions for risk reduction may be \n\nquantitatively evaluated and compared according to their implementation costs through a cost-\n\nbenefit analysis. \n\nIn Brazil, particularly in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, since the publication of the declaration \n\nN\u00ba 1, 01/23/1986 [52], by the Environment National Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio \n\nAmbiente \u2013 CONAMA), which created the requirement of an Environmental Impact \n\nStatement (Estudo de Impactos Ambientais \u2013 EIA/ Relat\u00f3rio de Impacto Ambiental - RIMA) \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nfor licensing activities significantly affecting the environment, studies of risk assessment \n\nstarted to be incorporated into this process, for certain types of enterprises, so that, besides the \n\nproblems related to chronic pollution, the prevention of major accidents should be also \n\nincluded in the process of licensing [50]. Thus, one more contribution of QRA is that it also \n\nprovides the competent authority with relevant information for enabling decisions on the \n\nacceptability of risk originating from accidents. \n\nCurrently, there are several manuals for implementation of a QRA. The Committee for \n\nthe Prevention of Disasters (CPR), from the Netherlands, is a worldwide reference in the area. \n\nThey published four books identified by colors (the purple, yellow, red and green books) [18; \n\n53; 54; 55], which are often used in environmental permits, based on the Environmental \n\nProtection Law, and in the fields of labor safety, transport safety and fire safety. Those books \n\nprovide methods for the determination of probabilities, possible damage and physical effects, \n\nas well as guidelines for human quantitative risk assessment. \n\nIn Brazil, the Environmental Company of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Companhia Ambiental \n\ndo Estado de Sao Paulo \u2013 CETESB) published in 2000 a guidelines manual for preparation of \n\nstudies in risk assessment (version only in Portuguese). This is the main reference on QRA in \n\nthe country [50]. \n\nAlthough CETESB [50] cites the risk to the environment as a totality (humans, animals, \n\nplants, etc.) and highlights several times the importance of considering impacts to the \n\necological environment, they describe a methodology for QRA capable of quantifying risks to \n\nthe human health only (surrounding communities), and not to the ecological environment. \n\nLikewise, CPR [18] describes in detail a methodology for human QRA and presents \n\nseparately (in its chapter seven of only one page), a few basic guidelines and references for \n\nQuantitative Ecological Risk Assessment (QERA), which are hardly enough for the purposes \n\nof this work. Hence, the next section presents the author`s view about QERA and the main \n\nreferences he used to form it. In advance, to our purposes, a QERA is nothing more than a \n\nQRA focused on ecological risks. \n\n2.4 Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment \n\nEcological Risk Assessments (ERAs) are conducted in an effort to translate scientific \n\ndata into meaningful information about risks to the ecological environment. This meaningful \n\ninformation may be provided by assigning values to the risks (i.e. by quantifying the risks), so \n\nthat an ERA can be addressed as a QERA. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nThe references [1; 2; 56; 57; 58] provide detailed guidelines for the process of ERA. \n\nAmong them, the main theoretical reference used in this work is the one published by the U.S. \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) [2], for being the most current and on the same plot \n\nas the others. \n\nEPA defined ERA as \u201ca process that evaluates the likelihood (author`s bold) that \n\nadverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more \n\nstressors\u201d. However, for the purposes of this work, it was added the term \u201cquantitative\u201d to \n\nemphasize that the assessment attaches a value or a price to the risk, because that is the \n\nobjective of our proposed methodology. As a result, we adjust EPA\u2019s definition and consider \n\nQERA as \u201ca process that evaluates and quantifies the likelihood that adverse ecological \n\neffects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors\u201d. \n\nAdverse ecological effects are \u201cchanges that are considered undesirable because they \n\nalter valued structural or functional characteristics of ecosystems or their components. An \n\nevaluation of adversity may consider the type, intensity, and scale of the effect as well as the \n\npotential for recovery\u201d [2]. They are evaluated through endpoints, i.e. assessment endpoints \n\nand measurement endpoints. According to Pastorok et al. [3], \u201cassessment endpoints are \n\ndefined as environmental characteristics or values that are to be protected (e.g. wildlife \n\npopulation abundance, species diversity, or ecosystem productivity) and \u201cmeasurement \n\nendpoints are quantitative expressions of an observed or measured biological response, such \n\nas the effects of a toxic chemical on survivorship or fecundity, related to the valued \n\nenvironmental characteristic chosen as the assessment endpoint\u201d. \n\nEndpoints could be expressed as effects on individual organisms, populations, \n\ncommunities, ecosystems and landscapes. Thus, the definition of QERA allows for risk \n\nassessment to be conducted at the various levels within the biological hierarchy (Figure 2.1). \n\nHowever, many QERAs consider only individual endpoints and fail to consider population, \n\necosystem, or landscape endpoints. \n\nIndeed, the typical QERAs suggests that ecological risk is characterized as a hazard \n\nratio of predicted or measured exposure to predicted no-adverse-effect level expressed as a \n\nconcentration or dose. This approach is also known as the hazard quotient, which is simply \n\nthe estimated exposure divided by a toxicity threshold. Thus, one has a value to the risk, \n\nwhich tells whether effects on individuals are expected (in case it is greater than 1) or not (in \n\ncase it is less than 1). Typically, a measured No-observed-effect-level (NOEL) or Lowest-\n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nobserved-effect-level (LOEL) \u2013 see glossary for details - for the individual-level endpoint of \n\ninterest are used as toxicity threshold. \n\nNevertheless, the hazard quotient approach can only evaluate individual-level effects \n\nand is not able to provide useful information for determining risks to populations in a QERA. \n\nFurthermore, Pastorok et al. [3] presents several limitations of the hazard quotient approach, \n\nsuch as:  \n\n\u2022 it can only indicate whether effects on individuals are expected, not the \n\nmagnitude of effects; \n\n\u2022 the results are difficult to interpret when the hazard quotient for one endpoint \n\n(e.g. mortality) conflicts with that for another endpoint (e.g. fecundity); \n\n\u2022 results are sometimes ambiguous depending on the toxicity threshold chosen \n\n(e.g. LOEL, NOEL); \n\n\u2022 usually does not provide enough information to make a management decision; \n\n\u2022 population-level processes may compensate for adverse effects on individuals; \n\n\u2022 the life history and ecology of a species can strongly influence the effects of \n\ntoxic chemicals at the population level; \n\n\u2022 at best, the hazard quotient can only be used to screen out risks that are clearly \n\nnot a problem (when the hazard quotient is considerably less than 1). \n\nHence, a QERA that ignores population-level effects and focuses only on individual-\n\nlevel endpoints may lead to inaccurate risk estimates. This will cause errors in environmental \n\nand risk management decisions and lead to inefficiency. Overestimation of risk can lead to \n\nwaste of resources to mitigate apparent problems that are not really important, whereas the \n\nunderestimation of risk can lead to inadequate risk management to control and prevent \n\nadverse effects to the ecological environment. \n\nAs a matter of fact, most toxicity data are expressed as adverse effects on individual \n\norganism, i.e. individual-level endpoints. So how to assess higher-level effects, if there are no \n\ntoxicity data expressed as higher-level endpoints? \n\nPopulation-level effects or higher-level effects can be obtained with the use of \n\necological models in the QERA. Such ecological models are essentially used to translate \n\nresponses in individual-level endpoints into effects on population, ecosystem, or landscapes \n\nendpoints. Particularly, when they focus on population-level effects, they are called \n\npopulation models.  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nIn a very simple case, a population model can predict the expected numbers of \n\nindividuals in a population in the future from estimates of survivorship and fecundity for \n\nindividual organisms. Thus, chemical effects can be modeled by perturbing the survivorship \n\nand fecundity values on the basis of knowledge about changes in these parameters obtained \n\nfrom toxicity test results. [3] \n\nBy the way, at the end of August 2009, a group of approximately 30 stakeholders from \n\nindustry, government regulatory bodies, and academia met for a 2-day workshop in Roskilde, \n\nDenmark (RUC09). The purposes of the workshop were to discuss future uses of population \n\nmodeling in risk assessment by industry as well as its understanding and acceptance by \n\nregulators. Forbes et al. found that \u201cA major motivation behind this initiative is that, for the \n\nsake of more transparency and better risk communication, ecological risks need to be \n\nexpressed in more relevant (value-relevant) units than hazard ratios, and these units will often \n\nbe at a population level\u201d [20].  \n\nMoreover, the predictive accuracy of population models has already been validated. For \n\ninstance, Brook et al. [59] validated the prediction of abundance and risks of decline by \n\ncomparing the historic trajectories of 21 populations (collected from long-term monitoring \n\nstudies) with the results of population models for these populations. They found that \n\npredictions were surprisingly accurate: \u201cthe risks of population decline closely matched \n\nobserved outcomes, there was no significant bias, and population size projections did not \n\ndiffer significantly from reality\u201d. \n\nAll things considered, one advocates the QERA approach based on the use of ecological \n\nmodels (particularly population models) to obtain population-level measures, so that risk \n\nanalysis can assess the probability of a population extinction (or decline) in the future under \n\nseveral environmental conditions, accidental scenarios and management actions. The next \n\nsection introduces theoretical basis on the use of ecological modeling in risk assessment. \n\n2.5 Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessment \n\nPastorok et al. states that \u201can ecological model is a mathematical expression that can be \n\nused to describe or predict ecological processes or endpoints such as population abundance \n\n(or density), community species richness, productivity, or distributions of organisms\u201d [3]. \n\nThus, population and metapopulation (i.e. set of populations of same species living spatially \n\nseparated but with potential for migration among them) models are a classification of \n\necological models, in which the mathematical expression is essentially used to translate \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nindividual-level effects (e.g., increased mortality, reduced fecundity) into population-level \n\neffects (e.g., reduced abundance, increased risk of extinction), so that one can estimate the \n\nrisk of adverse effects on a population via toxicity data expressed as adverse effects on the \n\nindividual organism. \n\nThe best way to choose the assessment endpoints is to check if they are directly relevant \n\nto environmental and risk managers of the enterprise. That is, the risk assessor should keep in \n\ncontact with these managers to build the ecological model. \n\nWith regard to the use of ecological models in the context of QERA, they should also \n\ninclude toxicity extrapolation models, which are used to extrapolate toxicity data in order to \n\ndescribe effects on individuals depending on the species, measurement endpoint and exposure \n\nduration. Thus, with the use of ecological models, individual-level effects can be translated \n\ninto higher-level effects (i.e. effects on population, ecosystem or landscape), and that is the \n\nbasic rationale for ecological modeling in risk assessment. \n\nAs a result, one can estimate the risk of adverse effects on populations, ecosystem or \n\nlandscape via toxicity data expressed as adverse effects on individual organisms (i.e. \n\nindividual-level endpoints). Moreover, once formulated the ecological model, it may aid in \n\nassessing natural recovery, in developing monitoring programs, in planning restoration of \n\nstrategies, or in deriving remedial action goals [3]. \n\nTo sum up, ecological models are used to extrapolate a measurement endpoint to an \n\nassessment endpoint. They can predict responses in the population, ecosystem or landscape \n\n(using assessment endpoints) via measured individual-level responses (using measurement \n\nendpoints). In the specific case of a population model, it is a mathematical expression where \n\nthe dependent variable (usually the future population abundance) is predicted through \n\nmeasure endpoints (such as survival and fecundity rates) and the population abundance at the \n\npresent time.  \n\nIt is important to note that there are several other components in population dynamics \n\nrather than survival and fecundity, as described in section 2.1.2, and they can also be \n\nincorporated into a population model. Some extensions to a population model are showed \n\nbelow (for more details see the references [3; 34; 35]): \n\n\u2022 age or stage structure; \n\n\u2022 sex structure; \n\n\u2022 parameters vary with time due to stochasticity; \n\n\u2022 parameters vary with time due to deterministic trend; \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n\u2022 parameters vary in space: population-specific models for metapopulations (e.g., \n\nref [12]); \n\n\u2022 parameters vary with abundance: density dependence; \n\n\u2022 additive effects: introduction, harvest, migration between subpopulations in a \n\nmetapopulation, and catastrophes (e.g., industrial accidents). \n\nFigure 2.3 and Figure 2.4 illustrate the idea of a very simple ecological model at \n\npopulation-level (i.e. population model); the former illustrates the natural dynamics of the \n\npopulation in the future (i.e. without chemical exposure) whereas the latter includes chemical \n\nexposure. In this very simple illustration, the future population abundance (assessment \n\nendpoint) is predicted through the survival and fecundity rates (measurement endpoints) and \n\nthe initial population abundance. Once again, there are several other variables which can \n\ninfluence the future population abundance. Sometimes they may not matter much, but \n\nsometimes they may matter a lot. It depends mostly on the knowledge of the modeler about \n\nthe population, on the available data and resources, and on the objectives of the modeling. On \n\nthe one hand, including other variables makes the model more realistic, on the other, it \n\nbecomes more complicated and more data is required. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Basic idea of a population model without chemical exposure \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 - Basic idea of a population model with chemical exposure \n\n \n\nGenerally, field sampling is used for the estimation of values to the measurement \n\nendpoints and the initial conditions of the assessment endpoints, whereas an exposure-\n\nresponse assessment is conducted in order to describe the relationship between the \n\nconcentration of the chemical and the magnitude of the individual-level responses of native \n\nspecies (represented by changes in measurement endpoints). This relationship is usually \n\nspecified by a dose-response function, so that it is necessary data on long-term effects of the \n\nchemical on the species being analyzed. \n\nSeveral ecological models and software are already available for use in risk assessment \n\nof toxic substances. Pastorok et al. [3] conducted a critical evaluation of ecological models \n\nthat are potentially useful for QERA and ranked the various candidate models based on \n\nevaluation criteria that include: realism and complexity of the model (i.e. whether key \n\nprocesses are included and how they are presented); prediction of relevant assessment \n\nendpoints and utility relative to regulatory compliance; flexibility; treatment of uncertainty; \n\ndegree of development, consistency and validation; ease of parameter estimation; regulatory \n\nacceptance; credibility (e.g. prevalence of users, availability or published reviews); and \n\nresource efficiency. Furthermore, the best models were selected for a more detailed evaluation \n\nand testing. \n\nNonetheless, selecting the best model depends on the specific problem, so that the \n\nmodeler must decide it taking into account the management objectives, the ecosystem, \n\nchemicals of concern, receptors and endpoints of interest, quality and quantity of available \n\ndata, and available resources. Thus, model selection is usually site- or issue-specific. Besides \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nthat, the level of realism and precision wanted as well as the quality and quantity of data will \n\ninfluence the complexity of the model selected [60]. \n\nHabitats used by most species around industrial sites are becoming increasingly \n\nfragmented by human activities and, consequently, several distinct populations of same \n\nspecies are living spatially separated, in spite of interacting at some level (e.g. exchange of \n\nindividuals). In fact, there are relatively few cases where the entire population resides within a \n\nsame area. Hence, most species are distributed across space as a population of connected \n\npopulations, i.e. metapopulation. According to Pastorock et al., \u201ca metapopulation is a set of \n\npopulations of the same species in the same general geographic area with a potential for \n\nmigration among them\u201d [3]. This way, some ecological models are designed to link \n\nGeographic Information System (GIS) with a metapopulation model, combining geographic \n\nand demographic data for risk assessment. \n\nBy the way, the purpose of the proposed methodology is to conduct a QERA at \n\npopulation-level. Hence, this work does not delve into concepts related to QERA at higher \n\nlevels and it might be referring to \u201cPopulation Modeling\u201d instead of \u201cEcological Modeling\u201d. \n\nThe reason for choosing (meta)population modeling instead of higher levels modeling is that \n\napart from providing ecologically relevant endpoints, (meta)population models are much \n\nmore tractable than higher level models. Figure 2.5 illustrates this point of view. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Evaluation of modeling endpoints based on ecological relevance and tractability. \n(From the ref. [61]) \n\nOther several advantages of using population models in risk assessments are related in \n\nthe reference [61]. Among them, Pastorok et al. states that  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n\u201cRisk estimation based on population modeling yields value-relevant output (e.g. \nreduced wildlife population abundance, increased extinction risk) that can be used in \ncost-benefit analyses to support management decisions concerning siting of facilities \nand mitigation actions\u201d [61]. \n\n \n\nIt is important to stress here that population modeling will be incorporated into the \n\nmethodology for QERA proposed in this work, which will then be capable of assessing \n\npopulation-level and metapopulation-level risks only, but not higher-level (ecosystem or \n\nlandscape) risks. Despite that, it is possible to strategically choose (meta)populations of native \n\nspecies that can effectively represent the ecosystem integrity. \n\nImplementing a population model for a QERA is actually an iterative process that \n\ninvolves data gathering, modeling, model validation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The \n\nsteps in implementing a population model for a QERA will be described in section 3.5. For a \n\ndetailed guidance on population modeling see the reference [35] as well as the reference [3] \n\nfor population modeling applied to risk assessment. \n\nOnce a population model is formulated (i.e. a mathematical expression), one has a \n\ndeterministic model (i.e. no probabilistic components) to predict adverse effects on \n\npopulations given the exposure to a chemical (in concentration or dose). However, as already \n\nmentioned, any realistic attempt to model population dynamics should account for \n\nstochasticity, especially because fluctuation is an obvious and often predominant feature of \n\necological environments. More on this regard will be discussed in section 2.5.3. \n\n2.5.1 Age and stage structure \n\nThe age or stage structure of a population refers to age/stage classes within the \n\npopulation. They attempt to consider the fact that individuals of different ages have different \n\ncharacteristics, which are reflected in their vital rates (e.g. survival and fecundities rates), \n\nwhereas individuals of same age have similar characteristics. For instance, juveniles may have \n\nlower survival rates than adults or juveniles may not be able to reproduce until they become \n\nadults. Conversely, in an unstructured (scalar) population model, the population is represented \n\nby a single age/stage, which denotes the totality of the population. Thus, unstructured models \n\nare considered to be a special case of structured models, with only one class of organisms \n\n[35]. \n\nStructured models are useful if the vital rates of individuals in different classes are \n\ndifferent enough to justify the discretization of their life span. Individual classes mean their \n\nages or stages. For example, population model of a fish with a life span of nearly 4 years \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\ncould be structured by their ages, e.g.: zero year old, one year, two years and three year; or by \n\ntheir stages: juveniles (zero year old) and adults (one year old or more). The criteria to \n\nstructure a model by stages instead of ages are: individual\u2019s ages are unknown; vital rates \n\ndepend on stage or size rather than age; growth is plastic, some individuals are retarded or \n\nhave accelerated development of vital rates. \n\nThose individuals that are the same age/stage are assumed to have the same survival and \n\nfecundity rates. However, those rates may differ between classes. This way, an structured \n\npopulation  model has a survival rate, Sx, a fecundity rate, Fx, and an abundance at time t, Nx(t) \n\nfor each age/stage class x. The abundances for each class form a vector of numbers (one for \n\neach class), whereas the vital rates are combined to form a transition matrix that is used in \n\nmost population models to account for age/stage structure. In fact, it is a transition matrix \n\nwhich has a special structure, called a Leslie matrix for age-structured models [11; 62] and a \n\nLefkovitch matrix for stage-structured models [63]. Above is an example of a Leslie matrix. \n\n \n\nN = O?0 ?? ?P?0 0 00 ?? 0 Q         (2.1) \n \n\nWhere \n\n?? = ???%\t%??\t????\t ?\t\t$R\t%\tR????\t\t$\t???\t?????\t\t\t?? = ????$R\t?\"\t????\t ?\t\t$R\t%\tR????\t\t$\t???\t??????\t\t \n \n\nThe reason for arranging the survival rates and fecundities in the form of a matrix is to \n\nprovide a convenient way to make projections of population\u2019s structure from one generation \n\nto the next [35]. For example, for an age-structured model the distribution of abundances in \n\nthe next step is given by the matrix multiplication: \n\n \n\nS\n0(? + 1)\n?(? + 1)\nP(? + 1)T = O\n?0 ?? ?P?0 0 00 ?? 0 Q \u00d7 S\n\n\n0(?)\n?(?)\nP(?)T      (2.2) \nWhere \n\n\n?(U) = $??!??\t ?\t\t$R\t%\tR????\t??\t???\t??????\t\t\t??\t?\t??\tU \n \n\nAssessors may then choose which age/stage classes they are interested in assess. In \n\nmost case, they will be interest in the total population abundance, which will be the sum of \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nthe age abundances. In some cases, however, the may be interested in the abundance of a \n\nspecific class only. \n\n2.5.2 Density-dependence \n\nSection 2.1.2 introduced the natural mechanism of populations to regulate themselves \n\n(i.e. density dependence). This section is particularly concerned about the mathematical \n\nmodeling of density dependence. For more details on density dependence see the reference \n\n[35], chapter 3. \n\nTo model density dependence, one must  \n\n\u2022 Decide which stages will count towards the abundance. At times a great amount \n\nof individuals in a certain life stage will not cause impact on the population\u2019s \n\nvital rates. For example, when adult birds compete for territory, only the adult \n\nstage would count towards density dependence. The abundance taken into \n\naccount may depend on all stages, selected stages or even on an average of all \n\nstages weighted by their respective fecundities. \n\n\u2022 Determine the vital rates to be altered. Depending on the behavior of the \n\npopulation, density dependence may affect fecundity, survival, migration rates, \n\nor a combination of these. This selection needs to be coherent with the transition \n\nmatrix. For example, in a model with a single stage, density dependence cannot \n\naffect survival rates because there are none. \n\n\u2022 Choose the form of the density dependence function. Modelers can define a \n\ndensity dependence function themselves, but there are functional forms of \n\ndensity dependence used in the literature, they are [35]: \n\no Exponential: no density dependence. All parameters related to density \n\ndependence are ignored, only the stage matrix is used in calculations. \n\no Scramble: as population size increases, the amount of resources per \n\nindividual decreases. If the available resources are shared more-or-less \n\nequally among the individuals, there will not be enough resources for \n\nanybody at very high densities.  This process of worsening returns leads \n\nto scramble competition, and can be modeled by logistic or Ricker \n\nequations [64]. \n\no Contest: if the available resources are shared unequally so that some \n\nindividuals always receive enough resources for survival and \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nreproduction at the expense of other individuals, there will always be \n\nreproducing individuals in the population.  This will be the case, for \n\nexample, in populations of strongly territorial species, in which the \n\nnumber of territories does not change much even though the number of \n\nindividuals seeking territories may change a lot.  This process of \n\ndiminishing returns leads to contest competition, and can be modeled by \n\nthe Beverton-Holt equation [65]. \n\no Ceiling: exponential growth to a ceiling. At each time step, the \n\npopulation grows exponentially, but if N is greater than the ceiling, then \n\nN is set equal to the ceiling. \n\n\u2022 Select function parameters. In case of scramble or contest competition, the \n\ncarrying capacity (K) maximal growth rate (Rmax) need to be estimated. The \n\ncarrying capacity is the level of abundance above which the population tends to \n\ndecline. Therefore one should observe the equilibrium population size for which \n\nthe number of individuals at the next time step tends to remain the same. Rmax is \n\nthe maximal rate of increase when the population that is regulated by density \n\ndependence is not yet influenced by it because of low density. The greatest \n\ngrowth rate observed might be skewed because of stochasticity, causing wrong \n\nestimation of the parameter. Therefore a more convenient form of finding the \n\nvalue one wishes for is by making a graph of R(t) as a function of N(t) (number \n\nof individuals at time t) and using the y-intercept as Rmax. Since considering R(t) \n\nequal to N(t+1)/ N(t) would cause both the independent and dependent variables \n\nto be affected by N(t) measurement errors, a less biased option would be to \n\nconsider R(t) equal to the geometric average of N around the time step t, i.e. \n\nV\n(? + 1) \n(? ? 1)? . In case of Allee effects [36; 37], the A parameter is the \npopulation size at which the vital rates are reduced to half of the original value. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that including density-dependence in a population model to \n\nevaluate the impacts of pollution (i.e. chemical risk assessment) makes the assessment less \n\nconservative, because density-dependence effects cause population to recover faster after a \n\npollution episode (except in the case of Allee effects). There is an intuitive way to understand \n\nthis: after chemical exposure, population suffers from decreasing abundance as long as \n\nsignificant amounts of chemical remain present; on the one hand, if density dependence is \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nignored, the population growth rate remains the same and population takes longer to recover; \n\non the other hand, if density dependence is considered, then after a decrease in population \n\nabundance, the growth rate suffers an increase (positive density dependence), so that \n\npopulation recovers faster. \n\n2.5.3 Stochasticity \n\nThe variability and uncertainty in populations and in the environment they live is a \n\nfundamental component of population dynamics, so that population models that assume all \n\nparameters to be constant (i.e. deterministic models) fail to account for unpredictable \n\nfluctuations of real population dynamics. Conversely, stochastic models allow us to consider \n\nthese fluctuations. They involve replacing constant parameters, such as survival and fecundity \n\nrates, and carrying capacity, with random variables responding to a probability distribution \n\nfunction (PDF), usually a normal or lognormal with a certain mean and variance. \n\nThere are many different kinds of stochasticity to be incorporated into a stochastic \n\npopulation model, such as:  \n\n\u2022 environmental temporal fluctuations (i.e. temporal variation in parameters); \n\n\u2022 spatial variation (e.g., population-specific parameters for metapopulations); \n\n\u2022 measurement and sampling errors that introduce additional uncertainty in \n\nparameter estimates of a population; \n\n\u2022 demographic stochasticity (because individuals only occur in whole numbers \n\nand most parameters may be fractional numbers, there will be additional \n\nuncertainty in the number of survivors and births in the next time-step); \n\n\u2022 model uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty concerning the structure of the equations used \n\nto describe the population) \n\n\u2022 catastrophes (i.e. extremely environmental events that adversely affect large \n\nproportions of a population, e.g., fire, drought, flood). \n\nEach one of them needs a different approach to modeling the effects of their \n\nfluctuations. This work will not delve into each one of them; readers are referred to the \n\nreference [35] for details on this issue. \n\nNevertheless, catastrophes will be an especial type of stochasticity in the proposed \n\nmethodology, because it allows accidental scenarios to be considered as extremely and rare \n\nenvironmental events included in a population model with a certain probability of occurrence \n\nper time step that may either be constant or vary with time. In other words, at each time step a \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\ncatastrophe (or an accidental scenario) may happen with a certain probability. If it happens, its \n\neffects of pollution can be modeled by changes in parameters since the present time step; if \n\nnot, all parameters remain the same. Section 2.5.5 presents this approach in more details. \n\nPastorok et al. states that there are two kinds of model endpoints: state variables and \n\nrisk estimates: \n\nState variables are expressed as population, ecosystem, or landscape \n\nindicators, such as population abundance, species richness, or landscape \n\nfragmentation index, respectively. [...] Risk estimates can be derived from the model \n\noutput for state variables in several ways, but the most common is to run the \n\nsimulation multiple times in a Monte Carlo analysis to account for variability and \n\nuncertainty in input variables as well as initial conditions\u201d. [3] \n\nIn other words, what Pastorok et al. meant is that risk can be estimated through multiple \n\nsimulations of the ecological model via Monte Carlo. Since a stochastic model has \n\nprobabilistic components characterized by random variables responding to a PDF, there will \n\nbe a different result for each single run. Thus, the results will also form a PDF which will \n\ncharacterize the risk estimates (e.g., risk of extinction, risk of population decline). Following \n\nsuch a procedure will allow variability to be evaluated as a degree of confidence, as well as to \n\nestimate upper and lower bounds on risk measures to evaluate uncertainty.  \n\nA simpler way to deal with uncertainties is to use them to derive worst and best case \n\nestimates of extinction risks, based on manual changes on parameters. Such procedure allows \n\nestimating a range (upper and lower bounds) to risk measures, such as time to extinction, or \n\nrisk of decline. The greater are the uncertainties in parameter values, the wider will these \n\nbounds be. If they are too wide, uncertainty may be unacceptable and do not meet the needs of \n\nrisk managers. At best, the bounds should be narrow enough to make decisions taken by risk \n\nmanagers based on the lower bound the same as those based on the upper bound (i.e. the \n\ndifference between the lower and upper bound should be regardless for risk managers). \n\nAll in all, a population model with random variables (and it should be present to better \n\nrepresent reality) is a stochastic model, since the input variables and/or initial conditions \n\nrespond to a PDF. Hence, the model does not provide a single result, but a distribution of \n\nconsequences associated to probabilities. The next section presents the ways of expressing the \n\nresults of a stochastic population model. \n\n2.5.4 Ways of expressing the risk estimates \n\nThe most traditional measure to summarize the results of a population model is the \n\nexpected population trajectory (i.e. the expected number of individuals in a population in the \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nfuture), which is usually expressed by a mean, a \u00b11 standard deviation, a minimum and \n\nmaximum values. However, several ecological-related problems and questions that population \n\nmodels address are phrased in terms of probabilities. For instance, a certain population of a \n\ncertain species may have a 50% chance of extinction in the next 10 years (i.e. a \u201ccritically \n\nendangered\u201d population according to IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of \n\nNature [39]). \n\nThe probability is usually derived from multiple runs (Monte Carlo) of a population \n\nmodel and may be expressed in many ways as bellow [3]. The selection of a specific \n\nexpression for the probability depends partly on the objectives of the assessment and partly on \n\navailable information for the species being modeled [3]. \n\n\u2022 Interval decline probability: the probability of a population declining by as \n\nmuch as a given percentage of its initial value at any time during the period of \n\nprediction. \n\n\u2022 Interval extinction probability: the probability of a population falling as low \n\nas a given abundance at any time during the period of prediction. \n\n\u2022 Terminal decline probability: the probability of a population being as much as \n\na given percentage lower than its initial value at the end of a simulation. \n\n\u2022 Terminal extinction probability: the probability of a population being as low \n\nas a given abundance at the end of a simulation. \n\n\u2022 Interval explosion probability: the probability of a population equaling or \n\nexceeding a given abundance at any time during the period of prediction. \n\n\u2022 Terminal explosion probability: the probability of a population being as great \n\nas or greater than a given abundance at the end of a simulation. \n\n\u2022 Time to extinction: the time required by a population to decrease to less than a \n\ngiven threshold abundance. This work basically uses two threshold: total \n\nextinction (i.e. zero individuals) and \u201chalf loss\u201d (i.e. 50% population decline). \n\n\u2022 Time to explosion: the time required by a population to exceed a given \n\nthreshold abundance. \n\n \n\nThus, for instance, to estimate the terminal extinction probability, one runs the \n\nsimulation multiple times and counts the occurrences in which the population ends the \n\nsimulation lower than a given abundance. The probability (of a population being as low as \n\nthe given abundance at the end of the period) will be the number of such occurrences \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\ndivided by the total number of rounds. Clearly, the greater is the number of rounds, the more \n\nprecise is the probability. \n\nBy the way, explosion probabilities and time are especially useful when a population \n\nincrease may be unwanted. For example, one may want to estimate the probability that a \n\ncertain seaweed species outbreak will reach an ecological damaging level, because it \n\nconsumes most oxygen available for fishes in the sea.  \n\nAlso, explosion probabilities and time are useful to evaluate recovery chances, when the \n\nobjective is to estimate the recovery of a population under risk management actions. In such \n\ncases, it may be useful to estimate the time it will take the population to increase to a certain \n\nabundance (i.e. time to recovery, analogous to the time to explosion), or the probability of \n\nrecovery within a specified time period (analogous to the explosion probability). \n\nTo conclude, there are other useful single measures to summarize the predictions of \n\nthe risk curves [34], i.e.:  \n\n\u2022 Expected minimum abundance: the average (over all replications) of the \n\nminimum population abundance of the trajectory. It is an estimate of the \n\nsmallest population size that is expected to occur within the simulated time \n\nperiod. \n\n\u2022 Median time to extinction: represents the most likely time required by a \n\npopulation to decrease to less than a given threshold abundance. It is the \n\nmedian value in the PDF of the time to extinction. \n\n2.5.5 Assessing impacts and risks of each accidental scenario \n\nThrough evolution, most species go naturally extinct, typically within ten million years \n\nor so of their first appearance [66]. Furthermore, human impact may accelerate this time. By \n\nhuman impact one means not only industrial accidents, but several other kinds of human \n\nperturbations to the ecosystem that may be continuously affecting a wildlife population, \n\nespecially if the ecosystem surrounds an industrial activity. Thus, even under the condition \n\nthat no accidental scenarios might happen, a population has already an implicit risk of \n\nextinction.   \n\nTherefore, assessing impacts and risks of an accidental scenario alone is not enough. It \n\nmust be compared against the present environmental condition (i.e. a non-impact scenario) to \n\nevaluate the changes in risks. In a non-impact scenario, no future impacts may occur (e.g., \n\naccidental scenarios), but only impacts that are already affecting the population. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nAn accidental scenario can be compared with a non-impact scenario in two ways. Both \n\nof them can provide relevant information, so that a QERA should, at best, present results \n\nusing both approaches. The first one considers only the impacts (i.e. the consequences) of the \n\naccidental scenario of concern, whereas the second considers both the frequency of \n\noccurrence and the consequences (i.e. the risks). \n\n2.5.5.1 Assessing impact \n\nIt considers that the accident is sure to occur at a specified time during the simulation. \n\nThis approach ignores that the accident is a rare event and considers it as an almost surely \n\nevent at specified time. This is particularly useful to evaluate the impacts (i.e. consequences) \n\nof the accident, because it presents the population dynamics before and after the accident. \n\nHence, one could compare an impact scenario to a non-impact scenario as a means of \n\nevaluating the accidental scenario in terms of increase in consequences. Then the results may \n\nbe used to determine whether the predicted consequences are substantial enough to require \n\npro-active response or action. For instance, this approach provides information to answer \n\nquestions such as: \n\n\u2022 Does the population go extinct before the accident? And what about after \n\nthe accident? \n\n\u2022 What will the population abundance of a species (e.g. sardine) be 1 year \n\nafter exposure to the concentration of toxic substances (e.g. \n\nhydrocarbons) released by the accident? \n\n\u2022 How long after the accident would it take for the exposed population to \n\ndecline by a certain value (say 20 or 30%)? \n\n\u2022 What is the probability of extinction in the population after the accident? \n\n\u2022 What is the probability of the population dipping below a given threshold \n\n(say 20 or 30% from the original population) at some point in the next \n\nyear after the accident? \n\n\u2022 If we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in mitigation \n\nactions that reduce the magnitude of impacts, what will be the extinction \n\nprobability decrease? \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n2.5.5.2 Assessing risks \n\nIt considers that the accident might happen with a certain probability (equal to the \n\naccident\u2019s frequency of occurrence) at any time during the simulation. This is similar to the \n\ncatastrophe stochasticity type (section 2.5.3). Thus, the results represents not only the \n\nconsequences of the accident, but the risks (i.e. a measure that encompasses both \n\nconsequences and frequency of occurrence). This approach allows the comparison of a non-\n\nimpact scenario with a potential accidental scenario, in terms of changes in risk measures \n\n(e.g., risk of extinction, risk of half loss). Also, it allows the comparison of the accidental \n\nscenarios among themselves, which is useful for prioritizing management actions. For \n\ninstance, this approach provides information to answer questions such as bellow, considering \n\nthat there is a certain chance of a catastrophic toxic spill: \n\n\u2022 How will the population abundance fluctuate during a period of 50 \n\nyears? \n\n\u2022 What is the change in the risk of extinction in the population? \n\n\u2022 What is the risk of the population dipping below a given threshold (say \n\n20 or 30% from the original population) at some point in a 50-year \n\nsimulation? \n\n\u2022 How serious are the changes in risk measures in a simulation with a \n\npotential accidental scenario when compared to a simulation with a \n\nnon-impact scenario? Changes may be serious if species jumps \n\ncategories of risk (risk categorization will be discussed in section \n\n2.5.7). \n\n\u2022 If we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in mitigation \n\nactions, what will be the extinction risk decrease? \n\n\u2022 And if we invest the same amount of money in control measures that \n\nreduce the accident\u2019s frequency of occurrence, what will be the \n\nextinction risk decrease? \n\n\u2022 If we have only U$100,000 available for risk management, how to \n\nallocate this money in an effort to reduce risks the most? Which \n\naccidents prioritize? \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n2.5.6 Cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios \n\nQuantifying risks of each accidental scenario provides a basis for categorizing them, \n\ncomparing them against a non-impact scenario, and prioritizing management actions. \n\nHowever, it may also be useful to cumulate risks of all accidental scenarios as a basis for \n\ncommunicating the total ecological risk. Therefore, this work also proposes an approach for \n\ncumulating risks of all accidental scenarios in only one measure, i.e. the FN risk curve \n\n(similar to the FN curve for the social risk in human QRA). \n\nOnce again, N is the average population decline number (of native species strategically \n\nchosen to represent ecological effects) and F the cumulative frequency of accidents with N or \n\ngreater abundance decline. This way, the greater the number of accidental scenarios in the \n\nassessment, the more points will have the FN curve, and so will it be more continuous. More \n\ndetails on how to build a FN curve will be given in section 3.6. \n\n2.5.7 Risk categorization \n\nEstablishing risk criteria for acceptability in the FN curve is a slow and complicated \n\nprocess that requires the participation of society and other interested parties in its judgment. It \n\nwas not an aim of this work to establish risk criteria for acceptability, which is a proposal for \n\nfuture works though.  \n\nNevertheless, the risk status originated from the approach in section 2.5.5.2 can be \n\ncategorized according to the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN) threat \n\ncategories [39]. One of the IUCN criteria (the only quantitative one) are expressed in terms of \n\ntime and risk of extinction, so either risk curves or cumulative time to extinction can be used \n\nto categorize risk based on these definitions. This way, a threatened population may be \n\nclassified into one of the 3 risk categories: \n\n\u2022 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED: at least 50% probability of extinction within \n\n10 years or 3 generations: whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years); \n\n\u2022 ENDANGERED: at least 20% probability of extinction within 20 years or 5 \n\ngenerations, whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years); \n\n\u2022 VULNERABLE: at least 10% probability of extinction within 100 years; \n\n \n\nThe IUCN risk criteria are expressed in terms of total extinction (zero individuals). \n\nHowever, these criteria are intended to classify species at high risk of global extinction in an \n\neffort to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the international community. It is used \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nto classify species affected by a whole range of environmental changes and human impact at \n\nglobal-level, not to classify the interaction of a single establishment with a local population or \n\nmetapopulation.  \n\nIn this context, establishing risk criteria for the purposes of a QERA was one of the \n\nmain themes of discussion and decision in a workshop on ecological modeling at Applied \n\nBiomathematics, Setauket, New York, on August 24-26 of 2011. The author of this work was \n\npresent at this workshop, together with some of the most cited authors in the field of \n\necological modeling. They concluded that it may be more appropriate to express risk criteria \n\nin terms of \u201chalf loss\u201d (i.e. 50% population abundance decline) instead of total extinction. As \n\na result, they proposed the following risk categories for the purposes of a QERA: \n\nTable 3 - Categories for assessing risks of each accidental scenario in a QERA. \n\nCategory Risk of half loss Years \n\nCritically Endangered > 50% 10 \n\nEndangered > 20% 20 \n\nVulnerable > 10% 100 \n\nLow risk > 0.1% 100 \n\nNegligible > 0.001% 100 \n\nBackground risk &lt;0.001% 100 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.8 Case studies \n\nThis section is especially concerned with a bibliographic review of published \n\napplications of ecological modeling in risk assessment. For instance, Naito et al. applies an \n\necosystem model for ERA of chemicals in a Japanese lake [67]; Pauwels presents a case study \n\nto show how risks to a brook trout (Salvelinus frontinalis) population exposed continually to a \n\ncontaminant (in this case the pesticide toxaphene) can be assessed and quantified using \n\necological modeling, as well as describes the data needed to parameterize a fish population \n\nmodel [31]; Bartell et al. presents an aquatic ecosystem model for estimating ecological risks \n\nposed by toxic chemicals in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada [68]; finally, \n\nChen uses an aquatic ecological risk assessment model to analyze exposure and ecological \n\neffects and to estimate community-level risks to fish, aquatic insects and benthic \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nmacroinvertebrates in Keelung River in northern Taiwan, associated with chemicals of \n\npotential concern such as ammonia, copper and zinc [69].  \n\nAll those works were very useful as a basis of knowledge on ecological and toxicity \n\nextrapolation models. It is worth noting, however, that none of them are within the context of \n\nindustrial accidents, as we aim to do in this work. \n\nIn addition, there are several other works on using ecological models not specifically in \n\nrisk assessment related to chemical exposure, but manly in species conservation and \n\nmanagement (see reference [70]). They are also very useful though, since they contain \n\ndemonstrations of how an ecological model is implemented. Such reference was essential as \n\nguidance on the application example of this work, because it contains a collection of case \n\nstudies of models applied to a variety of species (including fishes) and implemented in the \n\npopulation modeling and viability analysis software RAMAS GIS 4.0, which is an older but \n\nsimilar version to the same software that will be used in the application example of this work \n\n[34].  \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n3 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY \n\nThe proposed QRA methodology is directed to industrial accidents with potential to \n\ncause ecological adverse effects. The methodology considers both the accident\u2019s frequency of \n\noccurrence and the magnitude of the adverse ecological effects, so that it is capable of \n\nquantifying ecological risks caused by events with low frequency of occurrence and \n\ncatastrophic consequences. It is not restricted to assess ecological risks via individual-level \n\nendpoints that often leads to inaccurate risk estimates. It is also able to predict the responses \n\nof populations to toxic exposure (via population-level endpoints), taking into account the \n\nrelationships between individuals, the life history and ecology of a species. This way, the \n\nmethodology can assess the risk of a population extinction (or decline) in the future under the \n\nconditions that catastrophic accidents might happen. The proposed methodology is applicable \n\nonly for ecological risks caused by toxic substances. It is not able to assess ecological risks of \n\nfire or explosion caused by accidents with substances that are solely flammable. \n\nThere are similarities between the methodology and the basic guidelines for preparation \n\nof studies in risk assessment provided by CETESB in the reference [50], which is applicable \n\nto the assessment of industrial accidents with potential to cause damage to humans outside the \n\nestablishment (i.e. harm to people in surrounding areas, located beyond the establishment \n\nboundaries). The main similarities are in the qualitative risk assessment step that involves the \n\nconsolidation of accidental scenarios via techniques such as Preliminary Risk Analysis \n\n(PRA); and in the risk quantification expressed as a FN curve, which is similar to the FN \n\ncurve to quantify social risks used by CETESB. By contrast, the main difference is that the \n\nmethodology seeks to assess ecological risks only, whereas CETESB focus on human risk \n\nassessment. \n\nThe steps of the proposed methodology are as follows (shown in Figure 3.1). \n\n1. Problem characterization; \n\n2. Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios; \n\n3. Exposure assessment \n\n4. Frequency estimates; \n\n5. Population modeling; \n\n6. Risk quantification and evaluation. \n\n \n\nThe methodology is interactive, so that revaluation may occur during any part of the \n\nassessment, although deficiencies that must be revaluated may jeopardize resources available \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nto complete the QERA (e.g. time and money). The methodology uses objective criteria \n\nthroughout the second, third and fourth steps in order to rule out accidental scenarios that will \n\nnot significantly contribute to the final ecological risk, avoiding waste of resources. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Steps in conducting the methodology to Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment \nfor industrial accidents. \n\nIn the next sections, the aforementioned steps are discussed. \n\n3.1 Problem characterization \n\nThe first step is a planning phase on which the entire risk assessment depends. It \n\nrequires engagement between the risk assessor and others experts such as: risk managers, \n\nenvironmental managers, ecologists, technical managers, operators and others interested \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nparties when appropriate (e.g. industrial leaders, government, environmental groups, any \n\nsegment of society concerned about ecological risks).  \n\nThey should be able to (1) define risk assessment issues and objectives, (2) characterize \n\nthe establishment and installations (e.g. storage tanks, transport units, pipelines, loading \n\nequipment) to be included in the QERA and (3) characterize ecological components (habitats, \n\nspecies, life stages) in the region. Information to answer many of these issues may already be \n\navailable from other studies such as an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or even from \n\na human QRA. \n\n3.1.1 Risk assessment issues and objectives \n\nThe risk assessor should ensure that the results of the risk assessment will meet the \n\nneeds of risk managers, i.e. how will risk assessment help the process of risk management. \n\nThis way, they should reach a general agreement on characteristics such as: \n\n\u2022 Nature of the problem (e.g. licensing process, company\u2019s own initiative, \n\nproviding guidance, legal mandates). \n\n\u2022 Objectives for the QERA, including criteria for success. \n\n\u2022 Scale of the assessment (e.g. small area evaluated in depth or large area in less \n\ndetail). \n\n\u2022 General spatial (e.g. local, regional, or national) and temporal (i.e. the time \n\nframe over which effects will be evaluated) boundaries of the problem. \n\n\u2022 Expected outputs of the QERA and the resources available to complete it (e.g. \n\npersonnel, time, money). \n\n\u2022 Policy considerations (corporate policy, societal concerns, environmental laws). \n\n\u2022 Data and information already available. When data are few, further field work is \n\nneeded to collected more data and that requires more resources for the \n\nassessment. When more resources are not available and new data cannot be \n\ncollected, it may be possible to extrapolate from existing data. In this case, the \n\nrisk assessor and risk managers must reach an agreement about what is known \n\nand what will be extrapolated from what is known. \n\n\u2022 Acceptable level of uncertainty. If after the end of the QERA, the output does \n\nnot meet the acceptable level of uncertainty, investment of new resources may \n\nbe requested in order to develop ways of reducing uncertainty. The obvious way \n\nto reduce uncertainty is further field work to collect more data, so that additional \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nresources will be necessary. This way, the acceptable level of uncertainty should \n\ncomply with the resources available to complete the assessment. \n\n\u2022 Ecological impacts caused by past accidents. \n\n3.1.2 Characteristics of the establishment \n\nHere the risk assessor should collect technical information that characterize the \n\nestablishment with regard to its physical structure, process conditions, chemicals of potential \n\nconcern and installations (e.g. storage tanks, transport units, pipelines, loading equipment) in \n\nthe establishment that deals with those chemicals. \n\nSome installations may not significantly contribute to the risk because they do not deal \n\nwith a considerable amount of hazardous chemical; therefore it is not worth considering all \n\ninstallations in the QERA. It is the responsibility of the risk assessor to select installations to \n\nbe included in the QERA, under consultation of competent professionals and experts. The \n\nCommittee for the Prevention of Disasters provides a selection method to determine which \n\ninstallations should be considered in a human QRA, provided in the second chapter of the \n\nreference [18]. This recommends a selection method of installations with potential to cause \n\necological damage, because this method is not dependent on consequences to humans, but on \n\nthe amount of substance present in the installations and on the process conditions. \n\nMore specifically, the risk assessor should, if possible, gather relevant information \n\nabout: \n\n\u2022 Location of the establishment. \n\n\u2022 Layout of the establishment, pointing the hazardous installations to be included \n\nin the QERA. If transport units are included as dangerous installations, the \n\ntransport route should be specified. \n\n\u2022 Updated plants or aerial photographs showing ecological environments near \n\ndangerous installations. \n\n\u2022 Chemicals of potential concern identified by the official nomenclature, \n\nincluding: amount; ways of processing, handling, transport and storage; \n\nphysicochemical properties. Raw materials, intermediate and finished products, \n\nbyproducts, residues and wastes should also be considered. \n\n\u2022 Description of processes in each hazardous installation and operational routines. \n\nIf possible, besides a written description, it should include drawings, diagrams \n\nand flowcharts. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Operational data (e.g. flow, pressure, temperature) on the processes with \n\nchemicals of potential concern. \n\n\u2022 Protection and safety systems. \n\n3.1.3 Characteristics of the ecological components \n\nThe purpose here is to gather information about ecological features in the environment \n\npossibly affected by accidents in the establishment. Hence, consultants such as environmental \n\nmanagers and ecologists may help the risk assessor out here, who should determine \n\ncharacteristics such as: \n\n\u2022 Location of ecosystems possibly affected by accidents in the establishment. \n\n\u2022 Area (spatial boundaries) of ecosystems to be evaluated, highlighting zones of \n\npermanent preservation. \n\n\u2022 Ecological receptors (plants and animals) in the area, highlighting key species, \n\ne.g.: indicator species that are thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve \n\nas an early warning indicator of ecological effects; species of scientific and \n\neconomic importance; rare and endangered species; or any species to be \n\nprotected. For aquatic environments, indicator species are usually fishes, \n\ninvertebrates or green algae. For sediment and soils, they are terrestrial plants, \n\nsediment dwelling organisms or earthworms. For air1, representative species are \n\ntypically birds. \n\n\u2022 Geographic location and boundaries of populations or metapopulations of key \n\nspecies to be evaluated. \n\no Geographic distribution of local populations within the metapopulation \n\n(when appropriate). \n\n\u2022 Gather relevant information about the biology of key species. \n\n\u2022 Define assessment endpoints that can effectively provide information about the \n\npopulation of key species of concern. Population-level endpoints are usually \n\nabundance, population growth rate, age/size structure, and spatial distribution \n\n[3]. For the purposes of this methodology, at least the population abundance \n\nmust be considered. \n\n                                                 \n1For these types of ecosystems, the toxic concentration in air is usually so low that sophisticated risk \n\nassessments are not worthwhile. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Define the life stages of the species of concern and the points at which chemicals \n\nmay affect an individual [3]. \n\n\u2022 Physical stressors (e.g. hunting, fishing, boat traffic, thermal effluents, extreme \n\nweather changes) already affecting the key species. \n\n\u2022 Chemical stressors already affecting the key species. \n\nIt is important to stress that risk will be quantified via population models that describe \n\nthe population dynamic of key species chosen here. Consequently, the process of choosing \n\nkey species should be carefully conducted by the risk assessor and consultants, because it will \n\nhave a great influence on the results of the QERA. Populations or metapopulations of key \n\nspecies should be strategically chosen in a way that at least: they are representative in the \n\necosystem possibly affected; there is enough geographic and demographic data on the \n\npopulation to build a population model; and there is enough ecotoxicological data on the key \n\nspecies of concern (or on related species). \n\nWhen possible, one should build a visual representation of the relationships among \n\nrepresentative biotic groups of ecological receptors in order to illustrate the flows of energy, \n\ncarbon, or contaminants. For example, a food web relationships among representative biotic \n\ngroups within a ecosystem is useful to illustrate the key species\u2019 position in the food web, \n\nwhich helps to qualitatively understand the ecological adverse effects at higher levels than \n\npopulation-level (i.e. community- and ecosystem-level). \n\nMost information gathered in this phase will be necessary to guide the mathematical \n\nrepresentation of the population dynamics, in the sixth step of the methodology. \n\n3.2 Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios \n\nThis step is similar to the second step of the basic guidelines for human QRA provided \n\nby CETESB in the reference [50]. The difference is that here the focus is only on the \n\nidentification of accidents that may cause damage to the ecological environment. \n\nThis is a qualitative step of a risk assessment which aims at identifying all the initiator \n\nevents of accidents and its possible consequences, i.e. to consolidate accidental scenarios. \n\nStructured techniques are applied in order to (1) systematically consolidate all accidental \n\nscenarios, to (2) qualitatively rank the risks related to each accidental scenario according to \n\ntheir frequency and severity, and to (3) select those accidental scenarios that should be \n\nsubjected to a more detailed risk assessment (i.e. quantitative assessment) in the next steps.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nThe methodology makes use of the technique named Preliminary Hazard Analysis \n\n(PHA) to perform this step, although other techniques such as Hazard and Operability \n\nAnalysis (HazOp), \u201cWhat If?\u201d, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), among others, \n\nmay be used when the risk assessor finds it is suitable for the installation being studied. More \n\ninformation about PHA and other hazard analysis techniques is provided in the reference [71]. \n\nA worksheet is generally used to report the qualitative information that consolidate each \n\naccidental scenario, such as: hazard, initiator event (what, where, when), causes, control \n\nmeasures, possible consequences to the ecological environment, as well as frequency and \n\nseverity classes. A typical PHA worksheet is presented in Table 4. \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Typical Preliminary Hazard Analysis worksheet. \n\nPreliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) \nIdentified \nhazards \n\nProbable \ncauses \n\nPossible \neffects \n\nControl Measures C\nFreq. Sev. \n\nC\nRisk \n\nRecommendations \nand Observations  \n\nAccidental \nScenario \n\n              \n\n \n\nBelow is the description of information to be filled according to the PHA worksheet \n\nabove: \n\n\u2022 Identified hazards: hazards with potential to cause damage to the ecological \n\nenvironment. At best, it should contain the identification of the substance (CAS \n\nnumber), its temperature, pressure and flow rate. \n\n\u2022 Probable causes: description of the causes that may lead to the identified hazard \n\n(i.e. initiator events), such as cracking or breaking certain pipeline or equipment. \n\n\u2022 Possible effects: possible physical effects from the event (e.g. contamination of \n\nthe beach nearby, death of fishes, decrease fecundity of fishes, restrict \n\nphotosynthesis of marine plants, reduce the abundance of affected populations). \n\n\u2022 Control measures: barriers and preventive actions which could avoid the \n\noccurrence of the initiator event. \n\n\u2022 Frequency class: classification of the event on its frequency, according to Table \n\n5. \n\n\u2022 Severity class: classification of the event on its severity, according to Table 6. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Risk rank: qualitative value to the risk level of each accidental scenario, which is \n\na result of crossing the classes of frequency and severity, as illustrated in the \n\nTable 7. The risk is classified as Acceptable (A), Moderate (M) or Not \n\nAcceptable (NA). For acceptable risks, there is no need for additional measures, \n\ni.e., monitoring is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the control and \n\nrecovery measures are maintained. To risks qualified as moderate, additional \n\ncontrol and recovery measures should be evaluated, aiming at risks reduction. \n\nThe classification as not acceptable risks is an indication that existing control \n\nand recovery measures are insufficient. Alternative methods should be \n\nconsidered for reducing the likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of \n\nconsequences. \n\n\u2022 Recommendations and observations: recommendations for control and recovery \n\nmeasures that should be taken to decrease the frequency and/or severity of the \n\naccidental scenario. \n\n\u2022 Accidental scenario: Identification number to the accidental scenario. \n\n \n\nTable 5 - Frequency classes. \n(Adapted from the ref.

Accidental scenario results in \necological damage with long recovery time. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 7 - Risk ranking: Acceptable (A), Moderate (M) or Not Acceptable (NA). \n\n \n\nAfter all accidental scenarios have been identified, one should select the most relevant \n\nto a more detailed assessment. Therefore, one should clearly establish the criterion considered \n\nin the selection of the relevant accidental scenarios. For a conservative approach, one can use \n\na criterion based only on the severity class. Therefore, in this work, it is adopted the criterion \n\nof severity III or IV to trigger accidental scenarios for further analysis in the next step [50]. \n\nBecause PHA is often used as an initial risk study in an early stage of a project, the \n\nresults of this step may be already available. In fact, in a human QRA, accidents with \n\npotential to cause damage to humans are identified and they usually have potential to cause \n\necological damage as well. In this case, most accidents have been already identified and the \n\nrisk assessor should just review the ecological effects (i.e. possible consequences) caused by \n\nthese accidents. Conversely, if a previous PHA was not conducted yet, this is a great \n\nopportunity to do it. Likewise, this PHA might be used in a human QRA. \n\nAt the end of this step one should have a set of accidental scenarios characterized by \n\nqualitative information as in Table 4. As already mentioned, all accidental scenarios classified \n\nwith severity III or IV should be selected for further analysis in the next step. In addition, this \n\nstep allows to systematically identify the existing accidents and their possible ecological \n\ndamage, leading to an improved level of preparation to emergencies. \n\n3.3 Exposure assessment \n\nThis step should be conducted for all accidental scenarios selected in the previous step \n\nto a further and more detailed assessment. Firstly, it consists of applying mathematical models \n\nthat simulate the occurrence and movement of toxic releases in the water, atmosphere and \n\nsoil. \n\nMore specifically, one must estimate exposure of key species to the chemical released, \n\nfor each accidental scenario. This includes describing the chemical dispersion and predicting \n\nthe concentration that reaches key species of concern in each instant of time, i.e. \n\nconcentrations Ci(x,y,z,t) within a defined area (spatial boundaries), for each accidental \n\nscenario, i. Chemical fate and transport models have been often used to describe and predict \n\n \nFrequency Categories \nA B C D E \n\nS\nev\n\ner\nit\n\ny \nC\n\nat\neg\n\nor\nie\n\ns IV M M NA NA NA \nIII A M M NA NA \nII A A M M M \nI A A A A M \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\ndistribution and concentration of chemicals in the environment. Guidance on fate and \n\ntransport models is beyond the scope of this work; one suggests the references [73; 74] for \n\nadditional information. \n\nFor most accidental scenarios, meteorological conditions may influence the chemical \n\ndispersion and, consequently, the estimated exposure concentration. In such cases, it is \n\nnecessary to generate a set of meteorological scenarios for each accidental scenario, i. Thus, if \n\none has x accidental scenarios selected from the second step and y meteorological scenarios \n\ndefined here, one has now yx \u00d7  new accidental scenarios, each one with a specific function \n\nof exposure concentrations Ci(x,y,z,t). In other words, each meteorological scenario defined in \n\nthis step within each accidental scenario from the previous step will have a specific function \n\nof predicted chemical concentration that vary in time and space. \n\nA meteorological scenario is defined by meteorological parameters that depend on the \n\nkind of environmental media (e.g. air, soil, water) the chemical moves through. Such \n\nmeteorological parameters could be, e.g., weather stability class; wind direction and speed; \n\nair, soil/bund, water temperature; ambient pressure; humidity; tides of the sea; currents of the \n\nocean; season of the year; etc. To do not yield an exaggerated number of new accidental \n\nscenarios for the QERA, it is useful to group the data in a limited number of representative \n\nmeteorological parameters. \n\nSubsequently, because the next steps of the methodology do require additional costs and \n\nspecial expertise, one should decide whether the chemical concentration estimated is expected \n\nto cause ecological adverse effects, for all accidental scenarios. In other words, one should \n\nselect the accidental scenarios in which population-level effects are likely to occur, so that \n\npopulation-level ecological risks should be quantified. This way, the methodology needs a \n\ncriterion to trigger accidental scenarios for further QERA. The hazard quotient (i.e. an \n\nexposure concentration divided by an effects concentration) is a commonly applied criterion \n\nfor that [2; 75]. They are quick and simple to use and do not require special expertise from \n\nrisk assessors.  \n\nIn this sense, Pastorok et al. [3] states that \u201cat best, deterministic hazard quotients [\u2026] \n\ncan only be used to screen out chemicals, receptors, or site areas that are clearly not a problem \n\n(when the hazard quotient is considerably less than 1)\u201d. In addition to that, EurEco found in \n\nrecent study that most of the chemicals, pesticides and marine schemes developed for ERA, \n\nuse the hazard quotient, calculated as the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) \n\ndivided by the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC), to indicate low risk when it is less \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nthan 0.01 [75]. For a conservative approach in the proposed methodology, the PEC will be the \n\nlocal maximum2 of Ci(x,y,z,t), whereas PNEC is the concentration below which exposure to a \n\nsubstance is not expected to cause adverse effects on an individual organism. The former is \n\nprovided by the results of chemical fate and trasnport models and the latter by ecotoxicologial \n\ndata on the species being assessed, usually as a concentration based endpoint known as No \n\nObserved Effect Level (NOEL - see glossary for details). The ECOTOX database can be used \n\nas a source for locating single chemical toxicity data for plants and animals [76]. It is \n\nimportant to note that the PNEC is an individual-level endpoint and so is the hazard quotient. \n\nAs a result, the proposed methodology uses the criterion PEC/PNEC > 0.01 to pick \n\naccidentals scenarios to the next step. Because it is a very conservative approach, it is likely \n\nthat no accidental scenarios that considerably contribute to the ecological risk will be ruled \n\nout. Nonetheless, if it concerns the risk assessor, he might evaluate other chemical aspects \n\nsuch as: persistence and biodegradability; bioaccumulative potential (via bioaccumulation \n\nfactor); and solubility in water (in case of an aquatic ecosystem). For example, if the chemical \n\nis readily degradable, population-level effects are not likely to occur, even if PEC/PNEC is \n\ngreater than 0.01. \n\nFinally, at the end of this step one should have a set of accidental scenarios that are \n\nlikely to contribute to cause population-level effects. Several parameters consolidate each \n\naccidental scenario, they are mainly: hazard, initiator event, causes, control measures, \n\nmeteorological parameters, chemical concentration Ci(x,y,z,t), and hazard quotient. \n\n3.4 Frequency estimates \n\nFor the selected accidental scenarios in the previous step, the frequency of occurrence \n\nshould be estimated. The output of the QERA is very dependent on this estimate, so that an \n\nunder- or sub-estimate of this value can lead to rough errors in calculating the ecological risk. \n\nIn some risk assessments, the frequency of occurrence of an accident can be estimated \n\nfrom historical records contained in databases or references, since they are actually \n\nrepresentative to the case. Generic frequencies and times are presented in the reference [18]. \n\nIn the third chapter of this reference, Loss of Containment Events (LOCs) (caused by e.g., \n\ncorrosion, construction errors, welding failures, blocking of tanking vents, mechanical impact, \n\nnatural causes, domino effects, etc.) are described and their generic frequencies of occurrence \n\nare estimated, for various systems in an establishment, including stationary installations and \n\n                                                 \n2 By local we mean that it is within the spatial boundaries of populations being evaluated as well as within the \nsimulated time period. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\ntransport units such as: pressurized stationary tanks and vessels, atmospheric stationary tanks \n\nand vessels, gas cylinders, pipes, pumps, heat exchangers, pressure relief devices, \n\nwarehouses, storage of explosives, road tankers, tank wagons, and ships. \n\nHowever, those generic frequencies describe average situations and may need \n\ncorrections concerning specific circumstances of the installation under assessment. Due to the \n\ncomplexity of some installations, it might be necessary to use expert opinion and Reliability \n\nEngineering techniques (e.g., event tree, Event Sequence Diagrams, Bayesian Belief \n\nNetworks) in order to correct the generic frequencies taking into account the influence of \n\ncontrol measures (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops), as well as \n\nhuman errors that might contribute to the occurrence of the accidental scenario. In other \n\nwords, the risk assessment team might need to conduct a reliability analysis involving generic \n\nequipment failures, control measures and human error. It is beyond the scope of this work to \n\nprovide guidance on reliability analysis; for a general view on reliability theory, models, \n\nmethods and applications, see the references [41; 42; 43; 77]; and for specific information \n\nabout techniques such as Event Sequence Diagrams (ESD), Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) \n\nand Human Reliability Analysis see the references [44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49]. \n\nIn addition to that, for each accidental scenario the frequencies concerning \n\nmeteorological parameters that consolidate each accidental scenario (defined in the previous \n\nstep) should be also taken into account. Consequently, meteorological statistics (deduced, for \n\nexample, from a nearby and representative meteorological station) should be used to define \n\nfractional frequencies or number of observations to each meteorological scenario. \n\nFinally, only accidental scenarios that contribute significantly to the ecological risk \n\nshould be included in the QERA under the conditions that (1) the frequency of occurrence is \n\nequal to or greater than 10-8 per year and (2) PEC/PNEC is greater than 0.01. The criteria \n\ntherefore are used to trigger accidental scenarios for risk quantification and evaluation via \n\npopulation modeling in the next step. The first criterion is taken from reference [18], where it \n\nis stated that \u201ca threshold of 10-8 per year as criterion for including LOCs is considered \n\nreasonable since generic LOCs leading to the release of the complete inventory have failure \n\nfrequencies in the range 10-5 and 10-7 per year\u201d. The second criterion is taken from the \n\nprevious step of the proposed methodology and was already explained. \n\nThe output of this step is then a set of accidental scenarios that are likely to contribute to \n\nthe ecological risk, with their respective frequency estimates of occurrence. Several \n\nparameters consolidate each accidental scenario, they are mainly: hazard, initiator event, \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\ncauses, control measures, meteorological parameters, chemical concentration Ci(x,y,z,t), \n\nhazard quotient, and frequency estimate of occurrence (that is equal or greater than 10-8 per \n\nyear). \n\n3.5 Population modeling \n\nThis step is an iterative process (see Figure 3.2). Firstly, a population model is \n\nformulated (see section 2.5) in an effort to describe the natural population dynamics of key \n\nspecies in the area (without exposure to the chemical of concern). It is necessary to formulate \n\na population model to each key species, if more than one is being analyzed. The population \n\ndynamics must be described via assessment endpoints defined in the first step. The predicted \n\nchemical concentration, Ci(x,y,z,t) - for each accidental scenario, i, that may affect a \n\npopulation of concern - will be used as input variable to describe the population dynamics \n\nwith chemical exposure. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Iterative process of population modeling. \n\n \n\nPastorok et al. [3] provides a detailed guidance on ecological modeling in risk \n\nassessment. He also makes a critical evaluation of software designed for a QERA, pointing \n\ntheir possible uses and limitations. \n\nInput data will be necessary to parameterize the population model. The quality and \n\npredictiveness of the model depends mostly on the quality and quantity of these data. If data \n\nfor the key species are insufficient, then one could extrapolate the information from related \n\nspecies.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nTypically, a population model requires information on the following input variables [3; \n\n31]: age/size structure; specific survival and fecundity rates for each age/size; rates of \n\nimmigration or emigration; initial abundance for each age/size; estimates of variability for the \n\nvital rates and initial abundances; density dependence effects; geographic and habitat \n\ndistribution of key species; and foraging behavior. The required level of detail for a particular \n\nvariable depends on the assessment objectives. \n\nOnce the population model is formulated, it should be validated in order to make sure \n\nthat the model is a good approximation of reality and provides reliable predictions. The \n\nvalidation of a model is typically done by measuring the conformance of predictions with \n\nempirical data. This measure may be used to characterize the reliability of other predictions. \n\nIt is still a limitation of this methodology to provide an effective method for validation. \n\nHowever, there is some ways to validate a model. For example, if there is hardly no \n\nchemical/physical stressors currently affecting the population, there is a very simple way to \n\nvalidate the model: to run the population model multiple times for a non-impact scenario and \n\nassess its predictions. For non-impact scenarios, it is expected that the population abundance \n\nwill remain steady (for short and middle-term predictions) or will decrease very slightly (for \n\nlong-term predictions, because it is expected that every species goes naturally extinct, \n\nalthough it takes thousands of years). This way, if the population model considers no physical \n\nand chemical stressors, and the predictions show either high risk of extinction or high risk of \n\nexplosion, the model may be not correct and should be reviewed. \n\nAfter validation of the model, an uncertainty analysis of risk estimates should be \n\nconducted in order to determine if the level of uncertainty is acceptable. A simple way to deal \n\nwith uncertainties is to use them to derive worst and best case estimates of extinction risks, \n\nbased on changes on parameters. Such procedure will let the risk assessor to estimate a range \n\n(upper and lower bounds) to risk measures, such as time to extinction, or risk of decline. The \n\ngreater are the uncertainties in parameter values, the wider will these bounds be. If these \n\nbounds are too wide, uncertainty may be unacceptable and do not meet the needs of risk \n\nmanagers. At best, these bounds should be narrow enough to make decisions taken by risk \n\nmanagers based on the lower bound the same as those based on the upper bound (i.e. the \n\ndifference between the lower and upper bound should be regardless for risk managers). \n\nIt is important to stress that there are several other ways to measure and communicate \n\nuncertainty. To study them and provide an effective method to evaluate uncertainty is \n\nproposal for future developments in this methodology. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nIf the model is appropriate to describe the population dynamics of concern, uncertainties \n\nabout risk estimates are mostly because of uncertainties about parameters (e.g., survival rate, \n\nfecundity rate, carrying capacity, initial population abundance), what is originated from \n\nincomplete knowledge, limited sample size, measurement error and use of surrogate data. \n\nMore precise estimates for parameters can improve the model by narrowing the ranges of risk \n\nmeasures. This requires further field work and data gathering, what costs resources such as \n\nequipment, technology, staff, time, etc.  \n\nObviously, resources are limited, so its allocation should be optimized in a way that \n\nuncertainty is reduced the most. With this in mind, a systematic sensitivity analysis can point \n\nout to the most important parameters to allocate resources for further data gathering. This can \n\nbe done by observing the effects of changes in any model parameter on population extinction \n\nrisk. \n\nIn summary, if uncertainty is acceptable, then it is the end of this step. Otherwise, if the \n\npresent model provides risk estimates with an unacceptable level of uncertainty, then a \n\nsensitivity analysis can point out to the most important parameters which need better \n\nestimates. Then, further field work and data gathering on these parameters can improve the \n\nmodel. Finally, one has an improved model (with a validated structure and more precise \n\nparameters) which must be further analyzed until it is validated and uncertainties are \n\nacceptable. \n\n3.6 Risk quantification and evaluation \n\nThe output elements from the previous steps are necessary as input for this step, \n\nessentially: \n\n\u2022 a population model for each key species; \n\n\u2022 a predicted concentration Ci(x,y,z,t) within the area of concern for each \n\naccidental scenario, i; t in the same unit as the time-step of the model; \n\n\u2022 the frequency estimate of each accidental scenario per time-step of the model; \n\nGeneral temporal boundaries were determined in the first step. The risk assessor should \n\nnow define specific temporal boundaries for each accidental scenarios, i.e. the expected time \n\nframe over which the accidental scenario causes ecological effects, which depends basically \n\non the concentration Ci(t) within the area and on remedial actions to remove chemical from \n\nthe area. This will also become an input variable (i.e. the time of the simulation). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nSubsequently, an exposure-response assessment should be conducted in order to \n\ndescribe the relationship between the concentration, C(x,y,z,t), of the chemical and the \n\nmagnitude of the individual-level responses of key species (represented by changes in \n\nmeasurement endpoints, e.g., survival rate, fecundity rate, carrying capacity). It will be \n\nusually necessary to specify a dose-response function, which can be built from data on long-\n\nterm effects of the chemical on key species. These are ecotoxicological data at individual-\n\nlevel that basically look at the effects of life-cycle chemical exposure on input variables such \n\nas age-specific fecundity, survival and mortality. Because this is a major step in the ecological \n\nrisk assessment, this topic is not addressed in the reference [3]. Instead, they suggest the \n\nreferences [1; 56; 58] as considerable guidance on how to analyze for toxicity and exposure-\n\nresponse relationships. \n\nBy linking exposure-response relationships to the population model, one can now \n\npredict how different concentrations of the chemical (note that for each accidental scenario \n\nthere is a predicted chemical concentration) would cause adverse effects on populations of \n\nkey species. \n\nThe probability of adverse effects may be represented by probability-consequence \n\ncurves. For example, Figure 3.3 shows the consequences over time on population abundance \n\nfor three different scenarios of chemical exposure. The several ways of expressing those \n\ncurves were presented in section 2.5.4 and the two ways of assessing impacts and risks of \n\neach accidental scenario were described in section 2.5.5. The risks should also be categorized \n\naccording to section 2.5.7. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis may add insight to the QERA by \n\nexploring the sensitivity to assumptions. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Illustrative example of effects on a fish population for a 100 years simulation, for \nthree different concentrations of oil exposure. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively: C(x,y,z,t) &lt;1 ml/L; \n\nC(x,y,z,t) = 16 ml/L; C(x,y,z,t) = 30 ml/L. \n\nTo quantify the ecological risks of all accidental scenarios in only one measure, the \n\nvalues of the consequence estimates should be combined with cumulative frequency estimate \n\nof occurrence. This regard was introduced in section 2.5.6. As a result, one builds a FN curve, \n\nwhere N is the average population decline number and F the cumulative frequency of \n\naccidents with N or greater abundance decline. For that, the following steps should be \n\nconducted: \n\na. Select a key species, s. \n\nb. Set the average population abundance decline at the end of the simulation, siN , \n\nfor each accidental scenario, i, for each key species, s.  \n\nc. Build a list of average abundance decline, siN , and its respective frequency \n\nestimate of occurrence, )( 1?yFsi . It is necessary a list for each key species. \n\nd. The FN curve is now constructed by cumulating all frequencies in each list (i.e. \n\nfor each key species) for which siN  is greater than or equal to N: \n\n?\n??\n\n=\nNNi\n\nis\n\nsi\n\nFNF\n:\n\n)(         (3.1) \n\nThe Figure 3.4 shows an example of an FN curve that characterizes the ecological risks \n\noriginating from accidents in an establishment. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - FN curve for representation of the ecological risks related to accidents in an \nestablishment (figure for demonstration purposes only). \n\nTogether, the risk curves (for each particular accidental scenario) and the FN curve can \n\nbe used in making conservation decisions that involve planning future fieldwork, assessing \n\nimpacts and evaluating management actions. For all these cases, the objective of the decision \n\nmust be specified. It is assumed that the objective is minimizing the risk. Then a cost-benefit \n\nanalysis can be made with the results of a series of assessments. The cost is actually the \n\nimplementation cost of alternatives to reduce risk, and the benefit is the quantified risk \n\nreduction itself. Consequently, the selection criterion for the best alternative can be based on \n\nminimizing the cost:benefit ratio while satisfying either a cost or a risk constraint. \n\nTo sum up, the results of the methodology can support decisions such as for example: \n\n\u2022 if we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in control measures, \n\nwhat will be the frequency reduction in the FN curve? \n\n\u2022 How best to allocate this U$100,000 in order to maximize risk reduction? Which \n\naccidental scenarios prioritize? \n\n\u2022 If we change the layout of the establishment, setting hazardous installations \n\nmore distant from ecological environments, what will be the new FN curve? \n\n\u2022 What are the best conservation options (e.g., re-routing of spills, pollution \n\nremediation, habitat protection, translocation or reintroduction of individuals in \n\nthe population)? \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n\u2022 To which value an accident\u2019s frequency of occurrence must be reduced in order \n\nto achieve a risk level of acceptability? \n\nThe last question is particularly dependent on risk criteria for acceptability. In fact, after \n\nquantification of the risks to populations, they can be evaluated by stakeholders (enterprise \n\nleaders, government, environmental agencies, etc.) to determine whether the risks are \n\nacceptable or not. However, establishing risk criteria for acceptability is a slow and \n\ncomplicated process that requires the participation of society in its judgment. Once completed \n\nthe process, there is now a standard, i.e. a value or interval where the risk is considered \n\nacceptable. It makes law clearer, so that less money is spent with lawyers and so more money \n\ncan be spent with environmental and conservation management. \n\nSome scientists believe that the interpretation of the results of a QERA is a political \n\nprocess that requires criteria imposed by the society rather than by the scientific community \n\nalone. Others believe that scientists nevertheless have a responsibility to provide guidance \n\n[35]. It is not an aim of this work to provide guidance on risk criteria for acceptability. \n\nAlthough it was proposed risk categories for assessing a particular accidental scenario in \n\nterms of probability and time to half loss (see section 2.5.7), this work does not devise risk \n\ncategories in the FN curve that cumulates risks of all accidental scenarios. \n\nDetermining risk categories in the FN curve is still a shortcoming of the proposed \n\nmethodology. With this in mind, the FN curve makes the process of devising risk categories \n\nfor acceptability less difficult, because it is expressed in the same way as the societal risk in \n\nhuman QRA. For example, one should determine what is the acceptable frequency of a \n\npopulation declining by a given percentage (say 20%), or the acceptable frequency of a \n\npopulation extinction. And that is much more general than, for example, determining risk \n\ncategories for the volume of contaminated water, as in PROTEUS model [19], because each \n\nspecific ecosystem has its specific responses caused by exposure to a given volume of \n\ncontaminated surface water, so that risk categorization relies on a subjective evaluation of \n\necologists. \n\n  \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n4 APPLICATION EXAMPLE \n\nIn the Brazilian industrial current scenario, the Suape Port and Industrial Complex \n\n(SPIC), located in the state of Pernambuco, detaches itself by being the most complete \n\nshipping hub in the Northeast Region of Brazil for the location of port and industrial business. \n\nWith a complete infrastructure to fulfill the needs of the most diverse enterprises, Suape has \n\nattracted an increasing number of companies that are interested in either placing their products \n\nin the regional market or exporting to other countries [78]. \n\nThe SPIC can be considered as the largest center of investments in Brazil. Today, the \n\nsum of investments is about U$ 21.3 billion, spent by more than 100 active enterprises and \n\nother 35 in their implementation phase. An oil refinery, three petrochemical plants and two \n\nshipyards are in construction there. The attraction of such an amount of investment is mainly \n\ndue to the privileged geographical location of the state of Pernambuco, allowing the transport \n\nof products from/to more than 160 ports worldwide. Furthermore, it has been seen a great \n\ninvestment on research by universities in the region, with the purpose of developing and \n\nimproving the production and operation in SPIC. [78] \n\nWith an investment of about U$ 4 billion, the Abreu e Lima oil refinery (RNEST) is the \n\nbiggest establishment in the industrial complex, still in implementation phase. In fact, the \n\ncompany Petrobras (Brazilian multinational energy company and the largest company in Latin \n\nAmerica) has decided to build 3 refineries in the Northeast region of Brazil, for its closer \n\ndistance to consumer markets such as Europe and the USA. \n\nThe refinery RNEST has a project that predicts a processing of 200 thousand barrels of \n\nheavy oil per day, according to API (American Petroleum Institute) classification, and aims \n\nthe maximal production of diesel. The processed oil will come from the Campos Basin in Rio \n\nde Janeiro, Brazil, and from Orinoco, Venezuela [79]; which will supply RNEST through an \n\nexternal harbor in SPIC that is expected to receive oil tankers up to 170,000 DWT \n\n(Deadweight Tons). Considering the great amount of oil transported to RNEST, accidents \n\nwith potential to cause serious damage to the ecological environment might happen. For \n\nexample, a marine spill of a great volume of oil, forming a plume of hydrocarbons that \n\nspreads out into a very thin layer across the surface of the water and may come ashore, \n\ndamaging the ecological environment in the coast of Pernambuco. \n\nThe coastline of the state of Pernambuco has a very rich ecological environment, \n\ncomposed by ecosystems such as beaches, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, coastal islands, \n\nresting and atlantic forests, each of them interacting with one or more. Moreover, several \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nspecies are important to the economy of the state as well as for feeding of local population. \n\nHence, any exposure to toxic substances may cause significant consequences. \n\nThis section aims at testing the capability of the proposed methodology to quantify \n\necological risks, as well as its feasibility in terms of data and resource needs. This is achieved \n\nby performing a QERA via the proposed methodology in the activities of oil handling and \n\ntransport to RNEST at the external harbor. \n\nSeveral sources of information were used to perform this QERA: \n\n\u2022 Environmental Impact Statement of the establishment and associated documents \n\n[79; 80; 81]; \n\n\u2022 Ecotoxicological database [76]; \n\n\u2022 Comprehensive database of information about fish species [82]; \n\n\u2022 Case studies on population modeling [70]; \n\n\u2022 Published articles about the key species chosen and related species [83; 84]. \n\n\u2022 Demographic data about fish populations on the coastline of Pernambuco, \n\nprovided by the Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco \n\n(UPE); \n\n\u2022 Results of a fate and transport model designed to predict the oil dispersion in the \n\nocean after several accidentals scenarios of spill, provided by the Center for \n\nStudies and Essays in Risk and Environmental Modeling (CEERMA) of the \n\nFederal University of Pernambuco (UFPE); \n\n\u2022 Personal communication \n\no with ecologists of the Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of \n\nPernambuco (UPE); \n\no with chemical engineers from CEERMA (Centro de Estudos em Risco e \n\nModelagem Ambiental) of the Federal University of Pernambuco \n\n(UFPE). \n\n4.1 Problem Characterization \n\nFigure 4.1 illustrates the steps in conducting this methodology and detaches the current \n\nstep. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Step 1 within the flowchart of the methodology. \n\nThe problem consists of quantifying ecological risks originating from accidents \n\nassociated with transport and handling of crude oil that supplies RNEST, which is to be \n\nconstructed within the SPIC, in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. \n\n4.1.1 Risk assessment issues and objectives \n\n\u2022 Objectives of the QERA: this assessment aims at providing risk managers \n\nobjective answers about the ecological risks associated with transport and handling \n\nof crude oil to supply the oil refinery RNEST. To ensure that the results of this \n\nassessment would meet the needs of risk managers, the following specific \n\nobjectives were determined: \n\no to identify the significant ecological risks; \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\no to examine the dynamics of an representative species population in the \n\nsurrounding ecosystem; \n\no to quantify potential risks of accidental events \u2013 originating from ship \n\ntransportation of crude oil that supplies RNEST \u2013 to the aquatic ecosystem \n\non the coastal region of Suape, PE, Brazil; \n\no to be as conservative as possible in parameterization, predicting worst-case \n\nscenarios; \n\no to provide numerical basis of knowledge for communicating risks; \n\no to provide a basis for comparing, ranking and prioritizing accidental \n\nscenarios; \n\no to conduct a sensitivity analysis that expresses changes in risks measures as \n\na function of changes in the accidents\u2019 frequencies of occurrence; \n\no to conduct a sensitivity analysis that express changes in risks measures as a \n\nfunction of changes in the magnitude of the consequences; \n\no to deal with uncertainty in the results of significant accidental scenarios, \n\nmeasuring it by estimating a range (best case and worst case) to risk \n\nmeasures; \n\no to deal with natural (environmental) variability in time; \n\n\u2022 Scale of the assessment: small area evaluated in depth; \n\n\u2022 General spatial boundaries: local; \n\n\u2022 General temporal boundaries: 100 years; \n\n\u2022 Expected outputs of the QERA:  \n\no for a non-impact scenario: abundance trajectory summary, risk curves of \n\nextinction and time to population half loss (i.e. 50% decline); \n\no for each accidental scenario: abundance trajectory summary, risk curves of \n\nextinction, time to population half loss (i.e. 50% decline), and risk \n\ncategory; \n\no comparison of results between accidental scenarios and a non-impact \n\nscenario; \n\no FN curve for cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios; \n\no to point out further work that can effectively improve results. \n\n\u2022 Resources available: \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\no personnel: a risk assessor (i.e. the author of this work). Additionally, \n\nsupport was given by an ecologist, an oceanographer (for fate and transport \n\nmodeling), and a reliability engineer; \n\no time: 5 months; \n\n\u2022 Data and information already available: Environmental Impact Statement of the \n\nestablishment and associated documents [79; 80; 81]. \n\n\u2022 Acceptable level of variability in results: variability is considered acceptable as \n\nlong as the width of the 95% confidence interval in the results of the time to \u201chalf \n\nloss\u201d (i.e. 50% population decline) is smaller than 1%. \n\n\u2022 Ecological impacts caused by past accidents: none, the refinary is still in \n\nimplementation phase. \n\n4.1.2 Characteristics of the establishment \n\nThe refinery RNEST has a project that predicts a processing of 230 thousand barrels of \n\nheavy oil per day. The crude oil might be 50% Marlin, originating from the Campos Basin in \n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 50% Mejorado Carabobo, originating from Orinoco, Venezuela \n\n[79]; or, alternatively, 100% Marlim. \n\nThe refinery will be built in the peripheral industrial zone 3B (3B-ZI) of the CPIS in the \n\nnortheast region of Brazil, 50 kilometers south from the town of Recife, next to latitude \n\n8\u00ba17\u2019S and longitude 35\u00ba15\u2019W [80]. It was provided to RNEST an area of 6.3 square \n\nkilometers within the industrial complex. The following Figure 4.2 presents an aerial \n\nphotograph of the CIPS. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Aerial photograph of the Suape Port and Industrial Complex. \nFrom ref [78]. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe refinery is located about 6 kilometers from the external harbor. This is expected to \n\nreceive oil tankers up to 170,000 DWT (Deadweight Tons) and is surrounded by: to the north, \n\nthe Cocaia island, Tatuoca islands, Tatuoca river, Massangana river, Suape beach and Cape of \n\nSanto Agostinho; to the south, Gamboa point and Muro Alto beach (Figure 4.3). The refinery \n\nis then supplied by 8 pipelines connected to the external harbour. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - General view of the CIPS and the area selected to the construction of RNEST. \nFrom the ref [79] \n\nAs this QERA is concerned only with accidents associated with transport and handling \n\nof crude oil for supplying RNEST, no accidental scenarios within RNEST are considered, but \n\nonly transport units (i.e. oil tankers) and their routes to the external harbor. This way, the \n\ncoastal area was divided into 24 quadrants (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2A, \u2026, 6D), as in Figure 4.4. \n\nThe central point of each quadrant (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, \u2026, 6d) represents a specific possible \n\nlocation for an accidental oil spill. It is worth stressing that an accidental oil spill in the \n\nspecific point 3a covers not only failures caused by external impact (e.g., collision, stranding) \n\nbut also failures in unloading activities (e.g., full bore rupture of the unloading arm, leak of \n\nthe unloading arm). Conversely, accidental spills in other points cover only external impact, \n\nsince the oil tanker is not docked at the harbor. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Possible points of oil spill to be included in the QERA. \n\nThe Figure 4.5 presents a side view of an oil tanker. Also, there are some other technical \n\ninformation related to the transport of crude oil to the external harbor [78]: \n\n\u2022 transportation ships are double-walled oil tankers, which is compulsory; \n\n\u2022 about 1138 ships come in and out the harbor every year; \n\n\u2022 24 hours is the average duration of unloading per ship; \n\n\u2022 144 is the average number of transhipments per year for supplying RNEST; \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Side view of an oil tanker. \nFrom the ref [85]. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nFinally, crude oil is the only chemical of potential concern in this assessment, also \n\nnamed as crude petroleum, petroleum, crankcase oil or petroleum oil, CAS number: 8002059. \n\n4.1.3 Characteristics of the ecological components \n\nAmong the species in the wild fauna and flora of the coastal region of Suape, it was \n\nchosen to analyze fishes because [86; 87]: \n\n1. They have a relatively large size. Although oil causes immediate effects \n\nthroughout the entire spill site, it is the external effects of oil on larger wildlife \n\nspecies tha are often immediately apparent. \n\n2. Life-history information is extensive for most fish species. \n\n3. Their position at the top of the aquatic food web in relation to invertebrates and \n\ngreen algae helps to provide an integrative view of the watershed environment. \n\n4. Fishes are relatively easy to identify. This tends to decrease data collection \n\nerrors. \n\n5. Fishes are typically present, even in the most polluted waters. \n\nAfter personal communication with professor Simone Ferreira Teixeira from the  \n\nTropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco (UPE), it was chosen as indicator \n\na local fish population of a native species, i.e. Diapterus rhombeus, order Perciformes, family \n\nGerreidae, common name Caitipa mojarra (or Carapeba in Portuguese). Diapterus rhombeus \n\n(Figure 4.6) is one of the most common Gerreidae species in the estuarine region of Suape, \n\nNortheastern Brazil. They feed most on small benthic invertebrates and plant materials. These \n\nfishes are thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve as an early warning indicator of \n\necological impacts. Also, they have significant economic and social importance to the state of \n\nPernambuco, since local human communities feed on them as well as sell them as a means of \n\nlivelihood. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Photograph of a a Caitipa mojarra. \n\nThe Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco (UPE) provided \n\ndemographic data about those fishes, collected at the mangrove channel of the Tatuoca river \n\nduring 24 consecutive months (from March 2008 until February 2010). Two net catches were \n\nmade each month, i.e. catch 1 (C1) and catch 2 (C2), and the sampler area was 20 m2. Both \n\nC1 and C2 were made in the same area consecutively without releasing the fishes after the \n\nfirst catch, since they aimed at obtaining the abundance on the site and only one catch would \n\nbe less valuable (i.e. those fishes may be schooling and a catch could be sampled over a \n\nschool, overestimating the population abundance). For each catch it was counted the number \n\nof individuals as well as measured the total length, fork length and standard length (for \n\nconcepts see Fish Measurement in Glossary) of each individual. \n\nHowever, there were no available data about the specific geographic location of the fish \n\npopulation. Consequently, the geographic location and boundaries of populations were \n\nestimated via expert opinion only. They say that juveniles use shallow waters of the Suape \n\nbeach and mangrove channels for breeding and for a growth phase, and migrate to areas of \n\ngreater depth as soon as they become adults. Indeed, such opinion was validated by analyzing \n\nthe demographic data discussed in the previous paragraph, i.e. these data were collected in \n\nshallow waters and only 0,2% of all collect fishes presented a total length greater than 13.4 \n\ncentimeters, which is, according to the reference [82], the average length at which a Diapterus \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nrhombeus juvenile mature for the first time and thus becomes an adult. In summary, only \n\n0,2% of all collected individuals in shallow waters were adults. \n\nAll this considered, it was determined that the population is located at the Suape beach \n\n(at the latitude 8\u00ba 22\u2019 18.668\u2019\u2019 S and longitude 34\u00ba 57\u2019 7.160\u2019\u2019 W) within a region of about \n\n7850 square meters, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Location of the fish population representing the ecosystem integrity.  \n\nFinally, the chosen assessment endpoint to provide information about the population of \n\nconcern was its abundance. Then, the initial population abundance was estimated at 22,111 \n\nbased on population demographic data. \n\n4.2 Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios \n\nFigure 4.8 illustrates this step within the flowchart of the methodology. \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - Step 2 within the flowchart of the methodology. \n\nEach point in Figure 4.4 represented a possible location for an oil spill and so \n\nconsolidated an accidental scenario. It was conducted a PHA for each one of the 24 locations \n\nand only three of them had a severity class III or IV. These were selected for a detailed \n\nanalysis in the next step. More specifically, two scenarios had catastrophic severity class IV \n\n(i.e. 1a and 2a) and one had critical severity class IV (i.e. 3a), as illustrated in Figure 4.9.  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Accidental scenarios selected to the next step. \n\nOnce again, accidental events in location 3a cover external impact as well as unloading \n\nactivity. However, it is further from the fish population of concern in comparison with \n\nlocations 2a and 1a. Hence, until this phase of the assessment, it can be qualitatively stated \n\nthat the accidental scenario 3a has a greater frequency of occurrence but smaller severity in \n\nthe consequences; whereas accidental scenarios 2a and 1a have greater severities, because \n\nthey are closer to the fish population, and smaller frequencies, because they cover spills due to \n\nexternal impact only. Which of them has higher risks is still unknown. \n\n4.3 Exposure assessment \n\nSome meteorological conditions (i.e. topography, tide conditions, and the distribution of \n\ntemperature and salinity of the water) influence the dispersion of oil in the ocean and thus the \n\nchemical concentration to which the fish population is exposed after an accident. An analysis \n\nof previous works conducted on the coast of Suape [88; 89; 90] has shown that information on \n\nthe rainy season (from March to August) could be grouped in one meteorological scenario \n\nnamed \u201cWinter\u201d. Similarly, data on the spring and summer (from September to February) \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nwere grouped for the numerical representation of the dry scenario named \u201cSummer\u201d. Then, \n\nfor each period of the year two tidal conditions were considered, based on information \n\ncollected by tide gauges installed in the coastal Suape [88; 89; 90]. \n\nHence, each of the three accidental scenarios from the previous step was divided into 4 \n\nnew scenarios dependent on: the season of the year (summer or winter); the tide of the sea \n\n(spring tide or neap tide). This way, this step actually evaluates 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 accidental \nscenarios. \n\n4.3.1 Fate and transport modeling \n\nThe Princeton Ocean Model (POM) [91] was used to describe the costal ocean \n\ncirculation in the region of concern. The POM is a three-dimensional, primitive equation, \n\ntime-dependent, \\ coordinate, free surface, estuarine and coastal ocean circulation model, \nincorporating a turbulence closure model to provide a realistic parameterization of the vertical \n\nmixing processes. The computational code of the POM, now in public domain, was developed \n\nin the 80\u2019s by Blumberg &amp; Mellor [92]. Nowadays, it is one of the most tested and used \n\nmodels by the scientific community to this kind of application (e.g., [88; 89; 90; 93; 94; 95]). \n\nNonetheless, the original code of the POM model does not contemplate a routine that \n\nsimulates the dispersion of chemical plumes. For this reason, it was added to the \n\nhydrodynamic POM model a subroutine that calculates the chemical dispersion based on the \n\nequation of advective-diffusive fate and transport of pollutants developed by the Ocean \n\nModeling Laboratory (LABMON) of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo [96]. Therefore, once the \n\nocean circulation is established by the POM, a new simulation is ran by injecting a certain \n\nflow rate of oil at the release point (xr,yr) on the surface of the water. \n\nThe POM is based on the primitive equations of momentum for a Newtonian fluid. It \n\nbasically integrates the Reynolds theorem discretized by finite difference method. The \n\nprognostic variables are the three components of velocity field, temperature, salinity, and two \n\nquantities which characterize the turbulence (i.e. the turbulence kinetic energy and the \n\nturbulence macroscale). A key feature of the POM is the use of the sigma vertical coordinate \n\n(fraction of the local depth), which allows to consider both the surface and bottom layers of \n\nthe ocean as curved surfaces in the horizontal (Figure 4.10). The sigma coordinate system \n\nmakes the POM appropriate for dealing with significant topographical variability such as that \n\nencountered in estuaries or over continental shelf breaks and slopes (as is the case of this \n\napplication). \n\nThe sigma coordinate system is based on the transformation: \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n]? = ];\t\"? = \"; \t\\ = `abc?b ; ?? = ?      (4.1) \nwhere ], \", e are the conventional cartesian coordinates; f ? h + i where h(], \") is \n\nthe bottom topography and i(], \", ?) is the surface elevation. Thus, \\ ranges from \\ = 0 at \ne ? i to \\ ? W1 at e ? h. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 The sigma coordinate system in the Princeton Ocean Model. \n\nIn this study, the x-axis is considered perpendicular to the coastline in the northeast \n\ndirection, the y-axis is parallel to the coastline in the northwest direction, and the z-axis is \n\nperpendicular do the average surface of the ocean. The simulation grid has its origin at the \n\npoint of the coastline situated 2800 meters south of the external harbor (Figure 4.11).  \n\nThe equations which form the basis of the circulation model are described as follows: \n\n\u2022 The continuity equation \njk\njl \n\n\njk\njm \n\n\njk\njn ? 0        (4.2) \n\n \n\n\u2022 The Reynolds momentum equations \njk\njL \n o\n\njk\njl \n p\n\njk\njm \n q\n\njk\nj` W ?p ?

For more details on how the POM model was used to conduct \n\nthis application, readers are referred to [88]. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 - Discretization grid of the coastal region of the external harbor of Suape \n(integration domain). \n\nThe figures (Figure 4.12 to Figure 4.15) present an example of the fate and transport \n\nsimulation for accidental scenario 3a, i.e. as the oil plume disperses through the ocean after an \n\noil spill in location 3a, considering meteorological conditions winter/spring tide. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 - Dispersion of the oil plume in winter/spring tide 3 hours after oil spill in location \n3a. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13- Dispersion of the oil plume in winter/spring tide 17.5 hours after oil spill in \nlocation 3a. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 - Dispersion of the oil plume in winter/spring tides 19 hours after oil spill in \nlocation 3a. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 - Dispersion of the oil plume in winter/spring tide 19.5 hours after oil spill in \nlocation 3a. \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nFor each one of the 12 accidental scenarios, the fate and transport model predicted the \n\nweight of oil (in kilograms), q9u91(?), on the surface of the water within each cell R] \u00d7 R\" \nof Figure 4.11. The fish population under assessment covers three of these cells. It was \n\ncalculated the average oil concentration in time, Ci(x,y,z,t), for each accidental scenario, i, \n\nwithin the boundaries of these three cells (i.e. ??(]0, \"0, e0, ?)). To do so, it was made the \nfollowing calculation: \n\n\u2022 From a data map with the depth in each point of the ocean one gets dz (in \n\nmeters) at the center of each cell R] \u00d7 R\" (in meters); \n\u2022 One calculates the volume of water in R] \u00d7 R\" \u00d7 Re (in liters), p8'-)+(?) ?1000\t \u00d7 R] \u00d7 R\" \u00d7 Re; \n\u2022 From the results of the fate and transport model, one gets the predicted weight of \n\noil (in kilograms) per R] \u00d7 R\", q9u91(?), and considers the same amount of oil \nper R] \u00d7 R\" \u00d7 Re, i.e. q9u91(?) =\tq9u919`(?); \n\n\u2022 The total weight of oil within the three population cells is q)u*,63+)(?) =\nq9u919`,:)55\t?(?) \n q9u919`,:)55\tP(?) \n q9u919`,:)55\t?(?); \n\n\u2022 Considering the density of oil equal to 910 kg/m3, one calculates the volume of \n\noil (in milliliters) within the population cells, p,?5(?) ? 1000000 \u00d7q)u*,63+)(?) 910? ; \n\u2022 The predicted concentration within the population cells is then calculated as \n\n??(]0, \"0, e0, ?) ? p,?5(?) p8'-)+(?)? , where (x0,y0,z0) is the central point of the \npopulation\u2019s location (Figure 4.7). \n\nThis is a very conservative approach because when one makes q9u91(?) ?\n\tq9u919`(?), it is considered that 100% of the toxic components of oil on the surface of the \nwater will actually dissolve in water. The uncertainty of such assumption will be further \n\nevaluated in section 4.6.6. \n\n4.3.2 Hazard quotient \n\nTo select only accidental scenarios that may significantly contribute to the final \n\necological risks, it was performed a conservative screening assessment of the toxicological \n\neffects at individual-level for each accidental scenario. It was used the hazard quotient for \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nthat, i.e. the ratio of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) to a Predicted No Effect \n\nConcentration (PNEC). \n\nThe PEC was the maximal value through time of ??(]0, \"0, e0, ?); whereas PNEC was \ntaken from ecotoxicological data in the reference [76]. The value for the PNEC was the LC0 \n\n(i.e. lethal concentration to 0% of test organisms) of a related species (i.e. Parupeneus \n\nbarberinus, that is a fish of the same order as Diapterus rhombeus, i.e. Perciformes) \n\nassociated with crude oil. This extrapolation was needed because there were no such data on \n\nDiapterus rhombeus. \n\nTable 8 shows the PECs, PNECs and hazard quotient for each accidental scenario. The \n\ntoxicological test parameters and results are detailed in Appendix A. It can be seen that \n\nPEC/PNEC is much greater than 0.01 for all accidental scenarios in the winter, justifying their \n\nselection for the next step (Figure 4.16). Conversely, all accidental scenarios in the summer \n\nhad PEC/PNEC equal to zero, because in this season the oil plume moves to the south and \n\ndoes not reach the population of concern. Although it may reach other ecosystems to the \n\nsouth, those are out of the spatial boundaries of this assessment. Hence, accidental scenarios \n\nin summer could be ruled out of this assessment. \n\nTable 8 - PEC and PNEC for each accidental scenario in milliliter of oil per liter of water, and the \ncorresponding hazard quotient (PEC/PNEC). \n\nAccidental scenario PEC (ml/L) PNEC (ml/L) Hazard quotient \n\n(PEC/PNEC) \n\n3a-winter-neap tide 17.49 1 17.49 \n\n3a-winter-spring tide 10.12 1 10.12 \n\n2a-winter-neap tide 21.47 1 21.47 \n\n2a-winter- spring tide 14.91 1 14.91 \n\n1a-winter-neap tide 23.79 1 23.79 \n\n1a-winter- spring tide 18.10 1 18.10 \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Flowchart of the proposed methodology, detaching step 3 and the criterion for \nselecting accidental scenarios for step 4. \n\n4.4 Frequency estimates \n\nIt was conducted a screening reliability analysis based on generic frequencies of Loss of \n\nContainment Events (LOCs) for ships in an establishment covering loading and unloading \n\nactivities, and external impact. The reference [18] provides values for such frequencies per \n\nyear, as well as simple procedure to calculate them, which is dependent on some specific \n\ncircumstances about the activity of concern (those were defined in section 4.1.2). It is worth \n\nnoting that such frequencies may overestimate risks because they do not take into account \n\nother specific circumstances that could reduce their values (e.g., safety management systems, \n\nalarms, automatic stops). \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nTable 9 presents the generic frequencies for each specific LOC. Note that all ships \n\ntransporting oil to RNEST are double-walled tankers. \n\nTable 9 - Frequencies of LOCs for ships in a establishment. The base accident failure rate, f0, is equal \nto 6.7\u00d7 10-11 \u00d7 T \u00d7 t \u00d7 N, where T is the total number of ships per year on the transport route or in \nthe harbor, t the average duration of loading/unloading per ship (in hours) and N, the number of \n\ntranshipments per year. \n(From the ref [18]) \n\nShip/LOC Full bore \n\nrupture of the \n\nunloading arm \n\n(L.1) \n\nLeak of the \n\nunloading arm \n\n(L.2) \n\nExternal \n\nimpact, large \n\nspill \n\n(E.1) \n\nExternal \n\nimpact, small \n\nspill \n\n(E.2) \n\nsingle-walled \n\nliquid tanker \n\n6 \u00d7 10-5 \n\nper transhipment \n\n6 \u00d7 10-4 \n\nper transhipment \n\n0.1 \u00d7 f0 0.2 \u00d7 f0 \n\ndouble-walled \n\nliquid tanker \n\n6 \u00d7 10-5 \n\nper transhipment \n\n6 \u00d7 10-4 \n\nper transhipment \n\n0.006 \u00d7 f0 0.0015 \u00d7 f0 \n\ngas tanker, \n\nsemi-gas \n\ntanker \n\n6 \u00d7 10-5 \n\nper transhipment \n\n6 \u00d7 10-4 \n\nper transhipment \n\n0.025 \u00d7 f0 0.00012 \u00d7 f0 \n\n \n\nAccordingly, Table 10 shows the possible LOCs for the accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and \n\n3a. Note that ships perform unloading activities in location 3a only. The variables for \n\nestimating the base accident failure rate, f0, were determined in section 4.1.2 and are presented \n\nagain in Table 11. Then, the frequency estimates for each accidental scenario, that is the sum \n\nof the frequencies for each possible LOC, were calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n??'(\"???a?) ? ?P'(\"a?) ?

As already \n\nmentioned (section 4.3), the summer meteorological scenario varies from March to August (6 \n\nmonths) and the winter from September to February (6 months). Therefore, it was considered \n\nthat half of the year is winter and the other half is summer. Likewise, one sees spring tides \n\nduring half of the year and neap tides during the other half, since tides alternate on a weekly \n\nbasis. This way, each pair of meteorological condition has a frequency of 0.25 per year. As a \n\nresult, Table 12 presents the final frequency estimates for each accidental scenario with their \n\nmeteorological conditions. It can be seen that the values justify all accidental scenarios to be \n\nselected for the next steps of the methodology, since they are greater than 10-8 per year \n\n(Figure 4.17). \n\n  \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nTable 12 - Frequency estimates for each accidental scenario with their meteorological conditions. \n\nAccidental scenario Frequency estimate (per year) \n\n3a-winter-neap tide 0.09504198 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.02376049\t \n3a-winter-spring tide 0.09504198 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.02376049\t \n2a-winter-neap tide 1.98 \u00d7 10a? \u00d7 0.25 = 4.9\t \u00d7\t10a? \n2a-winter- spring tide 1.98 \u00d7 10a? \u00d7 0.25 = 4.9\t \u00d7\t10a? \n1a-winter-neap tide 1.98 \u00d7 10a? \u00d7 0.25 = 4.9\t \u00d7\t10a? \n1a-winter- spring tide 1.98 \u00d7 10a? \u00d7 0.25 = 4.9\t \u00d7\t10a? \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 - Flowchart of the proposed methodology, detaching step 4 and the criterion for \nselecting accidental scenarios for step 5. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n4.5 Population modeling \n\n4.5.1 Data gathering \n\nAs already mentioned, it was used demographic data on juveniles of the species of \n\nconcern, collected at the mangrove channel of the Tatuoca river during 24 consecutive months \n\n(from March 2008 until February 2010). \n\n4.5.2 Population modeling \n\nThe population used in modeling was that described in section 3.1.3 and illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.7. Data was on one stage class only (i.e. juveniles), because they were collected in \n\nshallow waters of the Suape beach and mangrove channels, and fishes migrate to deeper \n\nwaters as soon as they become adults. Hence, this population is made up of juveniles only. In \n\naddition, data provided the total length of each collected fish, so one could estimate their age \n\nbased on the von Bertalanffy growth function [97]: \n\nN- ?

If one or more growth studies about \n\nthe species in question are available in FishBase [82], they provide a list of the different \n\nestimates for different population (i.e. from different localities). There were two studies about \n\nDiapterus rhombeus: in a population located in the southwest coast of Puerto Rico, in \n\nnortheastern Caribbean Sea; and in a population located in the south coast of Margarita Island, \n\nVenezuela. Both studies presented very similar life history parameter estimates, so that any \n\nchoice between them would be irrelevant for our purposes. Therefore, it was randomly chosen \n\nto use life history parameter estimates from the study in Puerto Rico, i.e.: N?./ ? 22\t??; \tv ?\n\t2.21 \"???? ; ?$R\t?0 ? W0.08\t\"????. \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nAfterwards, it was estimated the age, t, for each collected fish and it could be observed \n\nthat 99,8% of individuals in the data were younger than 4 months3. As a result, the time-step \n\nof the model was defined at 4 months. In addition, this value is approximate to this species\u2019 \n\ngeneration time (i.e. 4.8 months) provided by life history data on Diapterus rhombeus in the \n\nreference [82]. \n\nA population model was then implemented in the population modeling and viability \n\nanalysis software RAMAS GIS v. 5 [34]. As the generation time of the species is \n\napproximately 1 time-step, the model should be scalar (i.e. unstructured): there should be just \n\none stage, and the stage matrix should have a single element that is the growth rate of the \n\npopulation (R). Also, for a conservative approach, it was not include density-dependence \n\neffects in the model. Once again, including density-dependence in a population model to \n\nassess impacts of pollution would make the assessment unrealistically optimistic, because \n\npopulation would recover very fast after chemical exposure.  \n\nTherefore, the model projected the population abundance (N) forward 100 years (or 300 \n\ntime-steps) from the initial population abundance estimate (22,111 individuals) using the \n\nmathematical expression: \n(? \n 1) = ?(?) \u00d7 \n(?). Temporal variability was incorporated \ninto R by establishing a lognormal distribution with a mean equal to 1.001 and a standard \n\ndeviation (SD) equal to 0.01. It was made a simulation with 10,000 replications. For each \n\ntime-step during each replication, a value to R was randomly selected. \n\nAll parameters of the model in question are summarized in Table 13. Note that the \n\nmodel with such parameters describes the natural population dynamics (without chemical \n\nexposure). In other words, it describes a non-impact scenario. \n\nTable 13 \u2013 Input parameters for population model without chemical exposure (non-impact scenario). \n\nParameter Value \n\nReplications 10,000 \n\nDuration 300 time steps = 100 years \n\nStages 1 (scalar model) \n\nSex structure All individuals (males and females) \n\nStage matrix (mean) ?1.001? \nStage matrix (SD) ?0.01? \n\n                                                 \n3 0,2% of the individuals were older than 4 months. These outliers were probably adults that do not live in \nshallow waters but were there to make reserves to the spawning period. \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental stochasticity distribution Lognormal \n\nInitial abundance 22,111 \n\n \n\n4.5.3 Validation of the model \n\nIt was used the subprogram RAMAS Metapop included in the software RAMAS GIS \n\nv.5 [34] to run the population model and check the future natural population dynamics (i.e. \n\nwithout chemical exposure). RAMAS GIS and RAMAS Metapop have already been validated \n\nat the program level, by checking all subunits and algorithms of the subprograms, by making \n\nsure that the program does what is described in the manual, by checking the lower-level \n\nalgorithms for consistency (e.g., environmental stochasticity distribution) [98]. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that RAMAS GIS and RAMAS Metapop do not allow users to \n\nchange their algorithms. If the modeler finds that such algorithm is not capable of simulating \n\nthe case-specific model, one should think about either programming its own algorithm or \n\nusing other software. Several software are already available for use in risk assessment of toxic \n\nsubstances. Pastorok et al. [3] conducted a critical evaluation of ecological models that are \n\npotentially useful for QERA. \n\nNot only the validation at the software level, but also the validation at the model level is \n\nresponsibility of the modeler. To validate the model, it was verified the following issues: \n\n\u2022 Do the results of the model address the risk assessment objectives? Yes, the \n\nresults provide risk measures (e.g. risk of extinction, population abundance \n\ndecline) that are within the expected results of the QERA. \n\n\u2022 Do the assumptions and limitations of the model fit the species being modeled? \n\nYes. The assumptions make a close approximation to reality that is sufficient for \n\nthe objectives of the assessment. Most of the limitations are not originated from \n\nthe model, but from poor data. \n\n\u2022 Are the parameters of the model reasonable? Yes. In fact, since there is no \n\nchemical exposure, it is expected that the population abundance will remain \n\nstable. This means that the population growth rate should be something around \n\n1. The population growth rate is given by the eigenvalue of the stage matrix, \n\nwhich is equal to 1.001 and approximate to 1. \n\nThe Figure 4.18 shows one of the results of the model. It can be seen that the population \n\nabundance increases slightly and this is, in fact, expected since the population growth rate is \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nslightly greater than 1. Actually, it would be more realistic if the population abundance \n\nfluctuated around the same level, what could be modeled by including density-dependence \n\neffects. On the one hand, it would make the assessment of a non-impact scenario more \n\nrealistic; on the other, it would make the assessment of an accidental scenario extremely \n\noptimistic and even unrealistic, because density-dependence effects would cause the \n\npopulation to recover very fast after an accident. In other words, massive population mortality \n\nwould happen after an accident, and so would density-dependence effects cause the \n\npopulation growth rate to increase. This is quite unrealistic because after an oil spill it is \n\nexpected that fishes find difficulties to feed and reproduce. \n\nAll things verified and justified, the model was considered to be correct.\n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Population abundance as it changes through time (without chemical exposure). The solid blue line represents the average value over 10,000 \nreplications at time t; the vertical blue bars represent \u00b11 standard deviations; and the red points re present the minimum and maximum values.\n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n4.5.4 Uncertainty analysis \n\nThis section deals with variability in the results originated from environmental \n\nstochasticity in population modeling. Uncertainty in the results of the whole QERA will be \n\nfurther evaluated. \n\nAs defined in the risk assessment objectives, variability is considered acceptable as long \n\nas the width of the 95% confidence interval in the results of the time to \u201chalf loss\u201d (i.e. 50% \n\npopulation decline) is smaller than 1%. The results of this measure for this population model \n\nshowed that the widest 95% confidence interval varies from 0 (i.e. 0% risk of half loss for all \n\nt) to 0.0089 (i.e. 0.89% risk of half loss for all t). As a result, uncertainty was accepted and \n\nthat is the end of this step. \n\n4.6 Risk quantification and evaluation \n\nHere, there is essential need for the following input elements, which are output elements \n\nof the previous steps: \n\n\u2022 A population model for the population of Diapterus rhombeus, located at the \n\nSuape beach (next to latitude 8\u00ba39\u2019S and longitude 34\u00ba87\u2019W) within a region of \n\nabout 7850 square meters, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. This was formulated in \n\nthe fifth step of the methodology. \n\n\u2022 The time-step of the population model is 4 months. \n\n\u2022 A predicted concentration ??(]0, \"0, e0, ?) at the center of the population \nboundaries, for each accidental scenario, i; t in the same unit as the time-step of \n\nthe model. These are presented in Table 14. \n\n\u2022 The frequency estimate of each accidental scenario, i, per time-step of the \n\nmodel, Fi(t\n-1). As the time step is 4 months and there are 12 months in a year, \n\n?(?a?) ? ?(\"???a?) 3? . These values are also presented in the Table 14. \n\nTable 14 \u2013 Input elements for risk quantification and evaluation. The time-step, t, is 4 months. \nCi(x,y,z,T) is the predicted average concentration of oil within the area of concern T units of time-step \n\nafter the occurrence of the accidental scenario, i. Fi(t\n-1) is the frequency of occurrence of the \n\naccidental scenario per time-step. \n\nAccidental scenario ??(??, ??, ??, ?)

The toxicological data, test parameters and results are \n\ndetailed in Appendix A. These data provide three points for an exposure-response assessment, \n\nas related in Table 15. \n\nTable 15 \u2013 Lethal concentrations LC0, LC50 and LC100 of oil to the organisms of the species \nParupeneus barberinus. \n\nResponse (in fraction of mortality) Concentration (ml/L) \n\n0 1 \n\n0.5 6.7 \n\n1 30 \n\n \n\nBased on these three points, it was added a logarithmic trendline, since it was expected \n\nthat the rate of change in the function quickly increases and then levels out. Also, it was the \n\nbest-fit curved line among several attempts of other five different trend or regression types \n\n(e.g., linear trendline, polynomial, power, exponential, or moving average trendline). The R-\n\nsquared value was 0.9953, which is a relatively good fit of the line to the data. \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 - dose-response function. \n\nThe fitted curve was then defined as the dose-response function. As a result, Table 14 \n\ncan be updated by defining the response in function of ?\u00a2?(]0, \"0, e0, U), as presented in the \nTable 16. \n\nTable 16 - Input elements for risk quantification and evaluation. The time-step, t, is 4 months. \nResponse is the predicted fraction of mortality in the population T units of time-step after the \n\noccurrence of the accidental scenario. Fi(t\n-1) is the frequency of occurrence of the accidental scenario \n\nper time-step. \n\nAccidental scenario Response Fi(t-1) \n\n3a-winter-neap tide \u00a00.82, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  0.00792016 \n3a-winter-spring tide \u00a00.66, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  0.00792016 \n2a-winter-neap tide \u00a00.88, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  1.63 \u00d7 10-7 \n2a-winter- spring tide \u00a00.77, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  1.63 \u00d7 10-7 \n1a-winter-neap tide \u00a00.91, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  1.63 \u00d7 10-7 \n1a-winter- spring tide \u00a00.83, ? ?\tU ? 00, ? ?\tU > 0  1.63 \u00d7 10-7 \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n4.6.2 Assessing impacts and risks of each accidental scenario \n\nFirstly, a simulation of a non-impact scenario was made, so that it could be compared \n\nwith the accidental scenarios. The input parameters for a non-impact scenario were already \n\npresented in Table 13. Subsequently, one assesses impacts and risks of each accidental \n\nscenario through the two approaches described in section 2.5.5. \n\n4.6.2.1 Assessing impacts of each accidental scenario \n\nThis approach compared only the impacts of each accidental scenario. By ignoring its \n\nfrequency of occurrence, one considers that the accidental scenario is sure to occur.  \n\nNote that for all accidental scenarios, massive population mortality happens only at the \n\ntime step that the oil spill occurs (T = 0), i.e. the first four months after an oil spill. That is \n\nbecause it takes at most 3 days until the oil plume reaches the population and one time-step is \n\nmuch longer than that. In the next time steps (T > 0), no mortality happens because of the \n\naccidental scenario4. Consequently, there was no need to assess impacts through time, but \n\nonly at the time step T = 0. In other words, a simulation was not necessary to estimate the \n\naverage population mortality associated with each accidental scenario, that would be simply \n\nthe initial population abundance (i.e. 22,111 individuals) times the fraction of mortality. Table \n\n17 presents the number of deaths associated with each accidental scenario. \n\nTable 17 \u2013 Number of deaths associated with each accidental scenario, based on the initial \npopulation abundance (i.e. 22,111 individuals) and on the fraction of mortality. \n\nAccidental scenario Fraction of mortality Number of deaths \n\n3a-winter-neap tide 0.82 18,131 \n\n3a-winter-spring tide 0.66 14,593 \n\n2a-winter-neap tide 0.88 19,458 \n\n2a-winter- spring tide 0.77 17,025 \n\n1a-winter-neap tide 0.91 20,121 \n\n1a-winter- spring tide 0.83 18,352 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4 Mortality would keep happening through time if, for example, accidental scenario consisted of a continuous oil \nspill from an oil well during more than one time-step. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n4.6.2.2 Assessing risks of each accidental scenario \n\nThree new models were implemented to represent accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and 3a. To \n\ndo so, one incorporated into the non-impact scenario model a source of environmental \n\nstochasticity that is independent of the year-to-year temporal variation of the growth rate. This \n\nis known as catastrophe.  \n\nIt was included two catastrophes for each of the three new models, representing their \n\npossible meteorological conditions in the winter (i.e. neap tide or spring tide). All \n\ncatastrophes had a certain frequency of occurrence per time-step (4 months), i.e. ?(?a?) ?\n?(\"???a?) 3? . Thus, for each time-step of each replication, a catastrophe was randomly \nselected to strike. If it does, it causes a certain fraction of mortality (originated from the dose-\n\nresponse function) to the population at that time-step.  \n\nTable 18 shows the parameter values for each of the three new models.\n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nTable 18 - Input parameters for population model with potential accidental scenarios. \n\nParameter Accidental  \n\nscenario 1a \n\nAccidental  \n\nscenario 2a \n\nAccidental  \n\nscenario 3a \n\nReplications 10,000 10,000 10,000 \n\nDuration 300 time steps = 100 years 300 time steps = 100 years 300 time steps = 100 years \n\nStages 1 (scalar model) 1 (scalar model) 1 (scalar model) \n\nSex structure All individuals (males and females) All individuals (males and females) All individuals (males and females) \n\nStage matrix (mean) ?1.001? ?1.001? ?1.001? \nStage matrix (standard deviation) ?0.01? ?0.01? ?0.01? \nEnvironmental stochasticity \n\ndistribution \n\nLognormal Lognormal Lognormal \n\nInitial abundance 22,111 22,111 22,111 \n\nCatastrophe 1 Name: 1a-winter-neap \n\nProbability = 0.0000002 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.09, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\nName: 2a-winter-neap \n\nProbability = 0.0000002 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.12, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\nName: 3a-winter-neap \n\nProbability = 0.00792016 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.18, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\nCatastrophe 2 Name: 1a-winter-spring \n\nProbability = 0.0000002 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.17, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\nName: 2a-winter-spring \n\nProbability = 0.0000002 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.23, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\nName: 3a-winter-spring \n\nProbability = 0.00792016 \n\n\u00a3!?$R?$??\t????\t??\t??\n=\t\u00a00.34, ? ?\tU ? 01, ? ?\tU > 0  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nThen, the results of each model were compared to the results of the model for a non-\n\nimpact scenario. Figures (Figure 4.20 and Figure 4.21) compare a non-impact scenario with \n\neach of the accidental scenarios. In the former, each point in the curve can be interpreted as \n\n\u201cthere is a Y% risk that, 100 years from now, the population abundance will be less than X\u201d. \n\nIn the latter, each point can be interpreted as \u201cthere is a Y% risk that the population \n\nabundance will fall by 50% (half loss) in or before time-step X\u201d. \n\nOver 100 years, there is a chance that the population will naturally become extinct. This \n\nchance is defined as the background risk. As the potential consequences of different \n\naccidental scenarios are measured in terms of probabilities, it is possible to compare them \n\nagainst the background risks that a population faces in the absence of any potential accidental \n\nscenario (i.e. a no-impact scenario). Added risk means the increase in risk of extinction (or \n\ndecline) that results from some impact on a natural population [35]. \n\nIt can be seen that accidental scenario 3a is the only one that causes significant increase \n\nin risk of extinction when compared with a no-impact scenario. Extinction risk curves for no-\n\nimpact scenario and accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are statistically superimposed. Also, the \n\naccidental scenario 3a is the only one with significant chances to cause population \u201chalf loss\u201d \n\nin the next 100 years. This certainly happens because accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are \n\nextremely rare (i.e. frequency of occurrence is too small). \n\nAll things considered, the accidental scenario 3a is the only one that may need \n\nmanagement actions in order to reduce its risks. However, some further assessment is needed \n\nto make such a conclusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Comparison of a non-impact scenario with each of the accidental scenarios, in terms of terminal extinction risk. Each point in a curve can be \ninterpreted as \u201cthere is a Y% risk that, 100 years from now, the population abundance will be less than X\u201d. The dotted line indicates the average value, whereas \n\nthe solid lines the 95% confidence intervals. The 3 vertical bars with two horizontal tabs represent the maximum difference between a non-impact scenario and an \naccidental scenario. The difference is measured as the maximum vertical distance between the curve. The location of the maximum difference (the threshold value \n\nat which the difference is maximum) may be different for different curves. The box to the upper right reports the values of the differences. The color of the text is the \nsame as the color of the risk curve with which the first (dark blue) curve is compared.

Each point in a curve can be interpreted as \u201cthere is a Y% risk that the population abundance will fall by 50% (half loss) in or before time-step X\u201d. In this \n\ngraph, there are two plots for each scenario. The histogram (vertical bar graph) shows the probability that the population size will fall below the specified \nthreshold exactly at a specific time step. The continuous curve is the cumulative probability distribution, and it shows the probability of falling below at or before a \nspecific time step. The 95% confidence intervals are also plotted together with the continuous curve. The graph is scaled according to the cumulative distribution \n\nand that is why the histogram is nearly imperceptible. If the median of a distribution is within the simulated time period (as happens with accidental scenario 3a), it \nis indicated by the solid vertical line. Both the line and the number for the median are in the same color as the distribution, so one can identify which simulation the \n\nmedian refers to. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n4.6.3 Risk categorization \n\nIt was used the risk criteria proposed in section 2.5.7, Table 3. For better reading, they \n\nare copied here: \n\nTable 19 - Categories for assessing risks of each accidental scenario in a QERA. \n\nCategory Risk of half loss Years \n\nCritically Endangered > 50% 10 \n\nEndangered > 20% 20 \n\nVulnerable > 10% 100 \n\nLow Risk > 0.1% 100 \n\nNegligible > 0.001% 100 \n\nBackground risk &lt;0.001% 100 \n\n \n\nBoth accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are statistically equal (in terms of 95% confidence \n\ninterval) to a non-impact scenario, so that they belong to the same risk category. Looking at \n\nthe data that originates the Figure 4.21, the cumulative probability of the time to half loss, \n\nthere is a 0% risk (95% confidence interval from 0% to 0.0089%) that the population \n\nabundance will fall below 11,055 (half loss) individuals in or before time-step 300 (i.e. 100 \n\nyears). This way, they vary from a \u201cBackground risk\u201d to a \u201cNegligible\u201d category. \n\nConcerning accidental scenario 3a, Figure 4.22 illustrates its risk categorization. The \n\nnecessary points for such categorization are related in the Table 20. One could then conclude \n\nthat accidental scenario 3a causes the population of concern to be categorized as \n\n\u201cEndangered\u201d. \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 - Risk categorization for accidental scenario 3a. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nTable 20 \u2013 Cumulative probabilities of the time to half loss associated with accidental scenario 3a. \n\nTime (years) Time-step (4 \n\nmonths) \n\nCumulative \n\nprobability of \n\nthe time to \n\n\u201chalf loss\u201d \n\nLower bound \n\n(95% \n\nconfidence \n\ninterval) \n\nUpper bound \n\n(95% \n\nconfidence \n\ninterval) \n\n10 30 38.04% 37.15% 38.93% \n\n20 60 60.81% 59.92% 61.70% \n\n100 300 99.09% 98.20% 99.98% \n\n \n\n4.6.4 Cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios \n\nIt is considered here all accidental scenarios selected to the current step of methodology \n\n(risk quantification and evaluation), i.e. accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and 3a in the winter. By \n\ncumulating the frequencies (Table 21) for which the number of deaths of a particular \n\naccidental scenario, siN , is greater than or equal to N, it was built the FN curve presented in \n\nthe Figure 4.23. \n\nThe y-axis is in logarithmic scale and that is because the frequency of occurrence of \n\n20121 or more deaths was defined at 10a\u00a4/\"??? instead of zero. The value of 10a\u00a4/\"??? is \nthe frequency criterion (in the fourth step of the methodology, i.e. frequency estimates) to \n\nscreen out accidental scenarios that are irrelevant in terms of risk. Therefore, ecological risks \n\nfrom any event that occurs with a frequency less than that are considered to be none (zero). \n\nTable 21 - Sorted list of frequencies. \n\nFrequency \n\n(per year) \n\nNumber of deaths (N) Frequency of N or more deaths \n\n(per year) \n\n0.00000049 20121 1E-8 \n\n0.00000049 19458 0.00000049 \n\n0.00000049 18352 0.00000098 \n\n0.02376049 18131 0.00000147 \n\n0.00000049 17025 0.02376196 \n\n0.02376049 14593 0.02376245 \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n--------------- 0 0.04752294 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 FN curve for cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios. \n\n4.6.5 Sensitivity analysis \n\nIt is worth exploring the sensitivity to parameters of the model for accidental scenario \n\n3a, so that one can understand how changes on specific parameters cause changes in risk \n\nmeasures. Firstly, one analyzed how reductions in the frequency of occurrence can reduce \n\necological risks. This is mostly useful to understand how important is the fourth step (i.e. \n\nfrequency estimates) of this methodology to the results of this specific QERA. As already \n\nmentioned, the methodology is interactive. In this sense, if the risk assessor finds it \n\nappropriate, more work on reliability analysis can be done in order to calculate more accurate \n\nfrequency estimates, and so more accurate risks. Moreover, analyzing the sensitivity to the \n\nfrequency estimates provides information to the risk manager who wishes to evaluate control \n\nmeasures and preventive actions (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops) \n\nwhich can reduce the accidental scenario\u2019s frequency of occurrence and so reduce the risks. \n\nSeveral simulations were made with the primary model for accidental scenario 3a, \n\ngradually reducing the frequency of occurrence. The Figure 4.24 presents the results of 4 \n\nsimulations in which frequencies were reduced by 20%, 50%, 90% and 98%. It can be \n\nobserved that even after a 98% reduction in its frequency of occurrence, risks remain still \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nhigh, i.e. 0.0843 risk of half loss in the next 100 years (95% confidence interval from 0.0754 \n\nto 0.0932). \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 - Sensitivity analysis that express changes in risks measures(i.e. cumulative probability of the time to half loss) as a function of changes in the \nfrequency of occurrence of accidental scenario 3a.

This is useful to the risk manager who wants to evaluate recovery measures and \n\nmitigation actions (e.g. re-routing of spills, burning the oil before it reaches an ecosystem, \n\npollution remediation, habitat protection, translocation of individuals) which can reduce the \n\nmagnitude of the consequences and so reduce the risks. \n\nSeveral simulations were made with the primary model for accidental scenario 3a, \n\ngradually reducing the adverse effects on population (in fraction of mortality). Figure 4.25 \n\npresents the results for 3 of them, in which the fraction of mortality was reduced by 30%, 50% \n\nand 80%. \n\n \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 - Sensitivity analysis that express changes in risks measures(i.e. cumulative probability of the time to half loss) as a function of changes in the \nmagnitude of the consequences.

Both the line and the number for the \nmedian are in the same color as the distribution, so one can identify which simulation the median refers to. \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nLastly, it was included density dependence in both primary models for a non-impact \n\nscenario and accidental scenario 3a. Density dependence included affects the single element \n\nin the stage matrix (i.e. the growth rate, R); density dependence type is Scramble because it is \n\nthought that resources are shared more-or-less equally among the juveniles; maximal growth \n\nrate (Rmax) is 1.222; carrying capacity (K) is equal to the initial population abundance (i.e. \n\n11,222 individuals); standard deviation of K is zero. \n\nThe rationale for analyzing the sensitivity to density dependence was to reinforce what \n\nhad already been stated in this work: including density dependence in a population model to \n\nassess impacts of pollution makes the assessment less conservative, because population \n\nrecovers faster after exposure. In other words, modeling density dependence may \n\nunderestimate ecological risks originated from industrial accidents. \n\nIt is worth stressing that an accidental scenario\u2019s model that includes density \n\ndependence has to be compared with a non-impact scenario\u2019s model that also includes density \n\ndependence. The Figure 4.26 shows such comparison. As expected, the maximum difference \n\nbetween risks including density dependence (i.e. 0.27) was smaller than the maximum \n\ndifference between risks not including density dependence (i.e. 0.99, see Figure 4.20). \n\nTherefore, changes in risks from a non-impact scenario to accidental scenario 3a are smaller if \n\ndensity dependence is included in both models. \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 \u2013 Risk sensitivity to density dependence in both models for a non-impact scenario and accidental scenario 3a.

In this context, \n\nuncertainty was measured by estimating a range (lower bound and upper bound) to risk \n\nmeasures based on the best case and worst case of accidental scenario 3a. \n\nUp until here, all parameters for the assessment had been defined from a conservative \n\npoint of view. Consequently, the presented risk measures associated with accidental scenario \n\n3a represent the worst case. It was then conducted a simulation from an optimistic point of \n\nview in an effort to represent the best case of accidental scenario 3a. As a result, the following \n\nchanges were made in the primary model for accidental scenario 3a (i.e. that of its worst \n\ncase): \n\n\u2022 Frequencies were reduced by 20%. \n\n\u2022 Density-dependence was included in the model. Density dependence included \n\naffects the single element in the stage matrix (i.e. the growth rate, R); density \n\ndependence type is Scramble; maximal growth rate (Rmax) is 1.2497; carrying \n\ncapacity (K) is 10,990; standard deviation of K is zero.  \n\n\u2022 It was considered that only 50% of the components of oil on the surface of the \n\nwater will actually dissolve in water, i.e. q9u919`(?) ? 0.5 \u00d7 q9u91(?)\t. This \nway, PNECs were further calculated using the procedure in section 4.3. \n\nAfterwards, the responses (in fraction of mortality) were calculated through the \n\ndose-response function in section 4.6.1. \n\nThe new frequencies and fractions of mortality for a best case scenario are presented in \n\nTable 22. The results for measuring uncertainty (lower and upper bounds) are presented in the \n\nFigure 4.27. Looking at time step 60 (i.e. 20 years), one can conclude that even from an \n\noptimistic point of view, risks originated from accidental scenario 3a cause the population of \n\nconcern to be categorized as \u201cEndangered\u201d (i.e. at least 20% risk of half loss in the next 20 \n\nyears, according to section 2.5.7. \n\nTable 22 - Input parameters for a best case accidental scenario 3a. \n\nAccidental scenario Fraction of mortality Frequency of occurrence \n\n3a-winter-neap tide 0.62 0.006336 \n\n3a-winter-spring tide 0.46 0.006336 \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 \u2013 Measuring uncertainty as the range between risks for the worst case of accidental scenario 3a (upper bound) versus risks for the best case of \naccidental scenario 3a (lower bound). \n\n \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\n5 CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe primary objective of this work was to develop and propose a methodology for \n\nQERA for industrial accidents. Indeed, it was presented a methodology capable of quantifying \n\necological risks caused by events with low frequency of occurrence but that may cause \n\ncatastrophic ecological damage. The main goal of the proposed methodology was to integrate \n\ninformation from four different studies that can contribute to quantify ecological risks \n\noriginating from rare events. Besides that, the specific objectives of this work were achieved \n\nsince the methodology: \n\n\u2022 uses reliability analysis for estimating frequencies of occurrence of accidental \n\nscenarios caused by equipment failure or human error; \n\n\u2022 uses fate and transport modeling to predict individual-level exposure in case of a \n\nparticular accidental scenario; \n\n\u2022 uses dose-response modeling and hazard quotient to estimate individual-level \n\nadverse effects; \n\n\u2022 uses population modeling to translate individual-level into population-level \n\nadverse effects; \n\n\u2022 provides results that allows for the comparison among accidental scenarios, as a \n\nbasis for prioritizing risk management measures under limited resources; \n\n\u2022 presents the total ecological risks of an establishment in a single risk measure \n\n(i.e. FN risk curve), as a simple way to communicate risks to stakeholders; \n\n\u2022 deals with environmental variability in time and space; \n\n\u2022 can point out further work that can effectively improve results via a sensitivity \n\nanalysis; \n\n\u2022 can deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers \n\non a quantitative basis; \n\n\u2022 is flexible in terms of data needs, i.e. can use several types of data; \n\n\u2022 uses objective criteria throughout the second, third and fourth steps in order to \n\nrule out accidental scenarios that will not contribute to the final ecological risk, \n\navoiding waste of cost and time; \n\n\u2022 was tested in an application example and proved to be practicable, efficient and \n\nconvenient. Because most data for applying the methodology was already \n\navailable from other studies and public databases, the methodology could be \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\napplied in a relatively short period of time, i.e. about 5 months.  If no data were \n\navailable, it is estimated that collecting data for such an assessment and applying \n\nthe methodology would take about 2 years. \n\n \n\nMore benefits of the methodology are described step by step as follows. The first step of \n\nthe methodology allows for an improved knowledge about dangerous installations within an \n\nestablishment, chemicals of concern and characteristics of the ecological environments \n\npossibly affected by accidents. It also encourages interaction of the risk assessor with other \n\nprofessionals such as risk managers, environmental managers, ecologists, technical managers \n\nand operators of the establishment. The second step allows to systematically identify the \n\nexisting accidents and their possible ecological damage, causing an improved level of \n\npreparation to emergencies. \n\nThe third step provides a screening assessment of the ecological damage possibly \n\ncaused by the identified accidents. Individual-level exposure is predicted via fate and \n\ntransport models. Most of these models are deterministic and some uncertainty in the results \n\nof the QERA is originated from their predictions. Uncertainty can be reduced by identifying \n\nthe most influent meteorological conditions and creating meteorological scenarios. \n\nThe frequencies of the accidental scenarios are estimated in the fourth step. Also, some \n\nuncertainty in the results of the QERA is originated from frequency estimates. This can be \n\nminimized by conducting a detailed case-specific reliability analysis. \n\nThe fifth step of the methodology uses mathematical modeling applied to ecology (i.e. \n\npopulation modeling) to translate individual-level exposure (predicted in the third step) into \n\npopulation-level effects. Population modeling proved to be an efficient approach to quantify \n\necological impacts caused by industrial accidents, providing results in more relevant units \n\nthan individual-level effects. The iterative process in implementing a population model was \n\npresented in a comprehensive scheme built by the author. \n\nSome uncertainty in the final results of the QERA is originated from uncertainty in the \n\npopulation model, which is originated from: difficulties in data gathering; difficulties in \n\nparameter estimation; weak ability to validate population models; effects of alternative model \n\nstructures. Nonetheless, uncertainty is an indelible characteristic of any future prediction. It \n\ndoes not make population modeling unfeasible as long as it is evaluated and communicated to \n\ndecision makers. To make this claim, one needs to correctly represent uncertainty in the \n\nresults. In this sense, the methodology measures uncertainty by estimating a range (lower \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nbound and upper bound) to risk measures based on the best and worst case of accidental \n\nscenarios. \n\nBesides being useful to a QERA for industrial accidents, the population model built in \n\nthe fifth step provides relevant information to tackle many key gaps in environmental \n\nmanagement, such as optimal resource allocation for monitoring affected areas, optimal \n\nmanagement of threatened and endangered species, and spatial planning for landscape \n\nrestoration and management. \n\nThe ecological risks originating from accidents in an establishment is quantified in the \n\nsixth step. Risks can be assessed in two ways: (1) by a comparative approach, in which \n\necological risks related to each accidental scenario are compared with ecological risks in the \n\nabsence of any potential accidental scenario (i.e. a no-impact scenario); and (2) by a \n\ncumulative approach, in which ecological risks of all accidental scenarios are cumulated and \n\npresented as a FN curve. Both ways provide quantitative and relevant information to support \n\nthe decision-making process for managing possible ecological catastrophes. Thus, the \n\ndecision maker could evaluate different alternatives of risk reduction via a cost-benefit \n\nanalysis. It is important to note again that the proposed methodology is interactive, so that \n\nrevaluation may occur during any part of the assessment or new information can be \n\nincorporated to improve results. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the methodology usually requires more than one person to \n\nperform it. In other words, the methodology demands team work because specific knowledge \n\non several different fields of studies is necessary. In most cases, team should be composed by \n\nan ecological risk assessor, an ecologist, a fate and transport modeler (e.g., an oceanographer, \n\nif toxic disperses through the ocean), a reliability analyst and a system engineer. \n\n5.1 Limitations \n\n\u2022 There are better ways of measuring and communicating uncertainty than the \n\napproach used in the methodology (i.e. based on the difference between the best \n\nand worst case of accidental scenarios). \n\n\u2022 No risk criteria were proposed in the FN risk curve. Although risk criteria was \n\nproposed for categorizing each accidental scenario alone (in terms of probability \n\nof the time to half loss), no risk criteria were proposed for the cumulative risks \n\nof all accidental scenarios in the FN curve. \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\n\u2022 The parameters for the population model are estimated through historical data \n\nonly, ignoring expert opinion. \n\n5.2 Future studies \n\nIn order to tackle the limitations of the methodology, it is proposed the following future \n\nstudies: \n\n\u2022 to study the several concepts and techniques of uncertainty analysis in \n\npopulation models, compare their performances, determine the best way to \n\nestimate and communicate uncertainty in a QERA for industrial accidents, and \n\nincorporate it into the methodology; \n\n\u2022 to propose ecological risk criteria for acceptability in terms of the results \n\nprovided by the FN risk curve. \n\n\u2022 to investigate the role of expert opinion (i.e. ecologists) in order to improve the \n\nparameterization of a population model, focusing on the study of Bayesian \n\nmethods to do so. \n\n\u2022 to incorporate expert opinion in the fifth step (i.e. population modeling) of the \n\nmethodology using Bayesian methods. \n\n5.3 Conclusions to the application example \n\nThe results of the QERA showed that ecological risks from accidental scenario 3a cause \n\nthe fish population of concern to be categorized as \u201cEndangered\u201d (according to section 4.6.3) \n\neven in a best case scenario. Conversely, ecological risks from other accidental scenarios are \n\nnegligible. From this point of view, management actions should be taken to reduce the \n\nfrequency of occurrence and/or the magnitude of the consequences of accidental scenario 3a, \n\nuntil risks reach an acceptable level (i.e. \u201cLow risk\u201d category). \n\n5.3.1 Limitations \n\n\u2022 The fate and transport model predicted the kilograms of crude oil on the surface \n\nof the ocean within each cell R] \u00d7 R\". However, the key species of concern do \nnot live only on the surface of the water, but in a depth range up to 70 meters \n\n[100]. In this context, it was made a crude approximation to convert kilograms \n\nof petroleum per area of water into milliliter of oil per volume of water.  \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n\u2022 The frequencies were estimated based on average situations (i.e. generic \n\nfrequencies) and did not take into account many specific circumstances of the \n\naccidental scenario under assessment (e.g., human error, control measures). \n\n\u2022 Input data to parameterize the population model was poor, i.e.:  \n\no The sampler area was too small (20 m\u00b2), leading to high standard \n\ndeviations in parameter estimates (e.g., population growth rate). \n\no Data did not allow the population model to be age/stage structured, \n\nbecause they were about juvenile individuals only. \n\no Data were collected in a specific location where no amount of oil was \n\npredicted in case of accident, so there was a need to extrapolate the \n\nlocation of the fish population in order to take into account chemical \n\neffects caused by oil exposure. \n\no ecotoxicological data to build a dose-response curve was extrapolated \n\nfrom a related species; \n\n\u2022 Ecological risks related to accidental scenarios in the summer (when the oil \n\nplume moves to the south) were not calculated because the oil plume does not \n\nreach the fish population of concern, although it may reach others populations to \n\nthe south. \n\n5.3.2 Future application \n\nAs the methodology is interactive, any new information and revaluation can be \n\nincorporated into the assessment at any time, starting a new round of the methodology, until \n\nresults are reliable enough to be presented to risk managers. \n\nThis section concerns about proposing a second round of the methodology in the \n\napplication example in order to improve results of the first round. In the second round, there is \n\nno need to redo every single step of the methodology. Instead, it should tackle the limitations \n\nin the results of the first round (section 5.3.1). In this context, the first round was useful to \n\npoint out what new efforts can effectively improve results, they are: \n\n\u2022 To model the fate and transport of oil in the water (i.e. per water columm \n\nR] \u00d7 R\" \u00d7 Re) instead of on the surface of the water (i.e. per water cell R] \u00d7\nR\"). As the POM is a three-dimensional model, it is also indicated for such \nmodeling. \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n\u2022 To conduct a more detailed reliability analysis in order to estimate more accurate \n\nfrequencies concerning specific circumstances of the accidental scenario under \n\nassessment. In fact, reliability engineering is a well-developed field of study, so \n\nthat a more detailed reliability analysis (including generic equipment failures, \n\ncontrol measures and human error) is possible. \n\n\u2022 To gather richer input data for the population model. Perhaps, one may need to \n\nchoose as indicator a population of another representative species in the coastal \n\nregion of Suape, i.e.: \n\no A species that is easier to monitor (i.e. bigger size, smaller abundance, \n\nand longer life spam).  \n\no Ecologists should have been collecting data about this population \n\ndynamics since more than 2 years up until the present. \n\no Data should include all age/stage classes of the population. \n\no Sampler size should be more representative. \n\no At best, ecotoxicological data about the species should be available. \n\no The location where data is collected should be over a region where \n\nsignificant amounts of oil are predicted (in case of accident). In this \n\ncontext, the first round of the methodology helps to decide this location.  \n\no If no richer data is already available, it will be necessary to collect these \n\ndata. This would take at least 2 years. Nonetheless, the first round of the \n\nmethodology provides basis of knowledge for an effective data collection \n\ndirected to a QERA. \n\n\u2022 To include another population to the south of the release points and to build a \n\nmetapopulation model with potential for migration between the two populations. \n\nThis way, ecological risks related to accidental scenarios in the summer could be \n\nalso quantified. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] Suter, G.

An \n\nevaluation of adversity may consider the type, intensity, and scale of the effect as well as the \n\npotential for recovery. \n\nAge Class: a category comprising individuals of a given age within a population. \n\nAgent: Any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse response \n\n(synonymous with stressor). \n\nAge-specific fecundity: the number of eggs or offspring produced per unit time by an \n\nindividual of a specified age. \n\nAge-specific survival: the proportion of individuals of age x alive at time t who will be \n\nalive at time t+1. \n\nAssessment endpoint: environmental characteristic or value that is to be protected (e.g. \n\npopulation abundance, species diversity, or ecosystem productivity).  \n\nBiodegradation: a process by which microbial organisms transform or alter (through \n\nmetabolic or enzymatic action) the structure of chemicals introduced into the environment. \n\nBiomarkers: measures of body fluids, cells, tissues or measures taken on the whole \n\norganism, indicating, in terms biochemical, cellular, physiological, compartmental or \n\nenergetic, the presence of contaminants substances or the magnitude of the response of the \n\ntarget organism. \n\nBiota: living groups of organisms or species. \n\nBiotic: living organisms, usually referring to the biological components of an \n\necosystem. \n\nChronic toxicity: the ability of a chemical to produce a toxic response when an \n\norganism is exposed over a long period of time. \n\nCommunity: an assemblage of populations of different species within a specified \n\nlocation in space and time. Sometimes, a particular subgrouping may be specified, such as the \n\nfish community in a lake or the soil arthropod community in a forest. \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nConceptual model: A conceptual model in problem formulation is a written description \n\nand visual representation of predicted relationships between ecological entities and the \n\nstressors to which they may be exposed. \n\nDensity dependence: a change in the influence of any factor (a density-dependent \n\nfactor) that affects population growth as population density changes. Density-dependent \n\nfactors tend to retard population growth by increasing mortality or emigration or decreasing \n\nfecundity as population density increases. They enhance population growth by decreasing \n\nmortality or increasing fecundity as population density decreases. \n\nDose: the amount of chemical taken into an organism per unit of time. \n\nDeadweight tonnage: a measure of how much weight a ship is carrying or can safely \n\ncarry. It is the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, \n\npassengers, and crew. \n\n\u00a5\u00a6\u00a7?: the toxicant concentration at which 50% of the test organisms show effects (e.g. \nmortality). \n\nEcological entity: A general term that may refer to a species, a group of species, an \n\necosystem function or characteristic, or a specific habitat. An ecological entity is one \n\ncomponent of an assessment endpoint. \n\nEcological model: a mathematical expression that can be used to describe or predict \n\necological processes or endpoints such as population abundance (or density), community \n\nspecies richness, productivity, or distributions of organisms. \n\nEcological relevance: One of the three criteria for assessment endpoint selection. \n\nEcologically relevant endpoints reflect important characteristics of the system and are \n\nfunctionally related to other endpoints. \n\nEcological risk assessment: The process that evaluates the likelihood that adverse \n\necological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors. \n\nEcosystem: the interacting system of a biological community and its non-living \n\nenvironmental surroundings. \n\nEcotoxicology: the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, \n\ncaused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including \n\nhuman), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context. \n\nEmigration: the movement of an individual or group out of an area or population. \n\nEndpoint: the biological or ecological unit or variable being measured or assessed. \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental impact statement (EIS): Environmental impact statements are \n\nprepared under the national environmental policy act by federal agencies as they evaluate the \n\nenvironmental consequences of proposed actions. EISs describe baseline environmental \n\nconditions; the purpose of, need for, and consequences of a proposed action; the no-action \n\nalternative; and the consequences of a reasonable range of alternative actions. A separate risk \n\nassessment could be prepared for each alternative, or a comparative risk assessment might be \n\ndeveloped. However, risk assessment is not the only approach used in EISs. \n\nExposure: The contact or co-occurrence of a stressor with a receptor. \n\nExposure-response assessment: a description of the relationship between the \n\nconcentration (or dose) of the chemical that causes adverse effects and the magnitude of the \n\nresponse of the receptor. \n\nFate and transport model:  a description of how a chemical is carried through the \n\nenvironment. This may include transport through biological as well as physical parts of the \n\nenvironment. \n\nFecundity: the number of live offspring per individual in a given age class that will \n\nsurvive to be counted in the first age class. \n\nFish measurement: Standard Length (SL) refers to the length of a fish measured \n\nfrom the tip of the snout to the posterior end of the last vertebra or to the posterior end of the \n\nmidlateral portion of the hypural plate. Simply put, this measurement excludes the length of \n\nthe caudal fin; \n\nTotal length (TL) refers to the length from the tip of the snout to the tip of the longer \n\nlobe of the caudal fin, usually measured with the lobes compressed along the midline. It is a \n\nstraight-line measure, not measured over the curve of the body; Fork length (FL) refers to \n\nthe length from the tip of the snout to the end of the middle caudal fin rays. \n\nGeographic information system (GIS): software that combines a database and \n\nmapping capability; often used in spatially explicit modeling. \n\nGrow rate: the rate of change of population abundance. Depending on the context, \n\ngrowth rate could also refer to the rate of change in mass or size of an organism. \n\nHabitat: the place where animals and plants normally live, often characterized by a \n\ndominant plant form or physical characteristic. \n\nHazard quotient: the ratio of an estimated exposure concentration (or dose) to a \n\ntoxicity threshold expressed in the same units. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nImmigration: the movement of an individual or group into a new population or \n\ngeographical region. \n\nIndicator species: species thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve as an early \n\nwarning indicator of ecological effects. \n\nKey species: species strategically chosen to represent ecological effects in the risk \n\nassessment. Key species can be, for example, indicator species that are thought to be more \n\nsensitive and therefore serve as an early warning indicator of ecological effects, species of \n\nscientific and economic importance, rare and endangered species, or any species to be \n\nprotected. \n\nLandscape: the traits, patterns, and structure of a specific geographic area, including its \n\nbiological composition, its physical environment, and its anthropogenic or social patterns. An \n\narea where interacting ecosystems are grouped and repeated in similar form. \n\nLife stage: a developmental stage of an organism (for example, juvenile, adult, egg, \n\npupa, larva). \n\nLife story: the temporal pattern and habitat association of life stages (e.g. egg, larva, \n\npupa and adult in an insect or egg, fry, smolt, juvenile, and adult in a salmon) and the \n\nschedule of births and deaths for a species. \n\nLowest-observed-effect-level (LOEL): the lowest concentration or amount of a \n\nsubstance, found by experiment or observation under the same defined conditions of \n\nexposure, that causes any alteration in morphology, functional capacity, growth, development, \n\nor life span of target organisms. \n\nMeasurement endpoints: quantitative expressions of an observed or measured \n\nbiological response, such as the effects of a toxic chemical on survivorship or fecundity, \n\nrelated to the valued environmental characteristic chosen as the assessment endpoint. \n\nMigration: the movement of an individual or group into or out of an area or population. \n\nMortality: the number of individuals of a population that died in a given period of time. \n\nNeap tide: when the tide\u2019s range is at its minimum. \n\nNo-observed-effect-level (NOEL): the greatest concentration or amount of a substance, \n\nfound by experiment or observation under the same defined conditions of exposure, that \n\ncauses no alterations of morphology, functional capacity, growth, development, or life span of \n\ntarget organisms. \n\nOrganism: any form of animal or plant life. \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nPopulation growth rate: the rate at which numbers of individuals are added to the \n\npopulation over time. \n\nPopulation: a group of interbreeding organisms occupying a particular space. \n\nPredicted Environmental Concentration (PEC): the local maximum of a predicted \n\nconcentration function C(x,y,z,t) related to an accidental scenario. \n\nPredicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC): the concentration below which exposure \n\nto a substance is not expected to cause adverse effects. \n\nProductivity: the rate of production of living biomass in a population or community. \n\nReceptor: The ecological entity that might be exposed to a stressor. \n\nRecovery: The rate and extent of return of a population or community to some aspect(s) \n\nof its previous condition. Because of the dynamic nature of ecological systems, the attributes \n\nof a \u201crecovered\u201d system should be carefully defined. \n\nRecovery measures: mitigation actions which could reduce the magnitude of the \n\nconsequences of an accidental scenario, and so reduce the risk. \n\nRemedial action goals: a subset of remedial action objectives consisting of medium-\n\nspecific chemical concentrations that are protective of human health and the ecological \n\nenvironment. \n\nSpatially explicit model:  a model that tracks spatial information (e.g. the locations of \n\norganisms or the pattern of a landscape). \n\nSpecies: An organism belonging to such a category, represented in binomial \n\nnomenclature by an uncapitalized Latin adjective or noun following a capitalized genus name, \n\nas in Ananas comosus, the pineapple, and Equus caballus, the horse. \n\nSpecies richness: the total number of species in a location or the number per unit area \n\nor volume. \n\nSpring tide: when the tide\u2019s range is at its maximum. It is not named after the season \n\n(i.e. spring) but, like that word, derives from an earlier meaning of jump, burst forth, rise as in \n\na natural spring. \n\nStressor: any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse \n\nresponse in an organism. \n\nSurvival: the number of individuals of a population that are alive after a given period of \n\ntime. \n\nThreshold: the chemical concentration (or dose) at which physical or biological effects \n\nbegin to be produced. \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\nToxicity extrapolation model: any mathematical expression for extrapolating toxicity \n\ndata between species, endpoints, exposure durations, and so forth. Also includes uncertainty \n\nfactors. \n\nToxicity test: a test in which organisms are exposed to chemicals in a test medium (for \n\nexample, waste, sediment, soil) to determine the effects of exposure."}]}}}
