Com uma \nidade Cenomaniano inferior terminal a m\u00e9dio, esta sec\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido interpretada \ncomo registando a transi\u00e7\u00e3o de um ambiente marinho aberto de plataforma interna a \nambiente marginal marinho restrito (lagunar) entre o final do Cenomaniano inferior \ne o in\u00edcio do Cenomaniano m\u00e9dio. Onze amostras foram recolhidas em quatro n\u00edveis \nmargosos selecionados ao longo do perfil estratigr\u00e1fico e preparadas para an\u00e1lise ao \nmicrosc\u00f3pio, atrav\u00e9s de t\u00e9cnicas palinol\u00f3gicas normalizadas.

As associa\u00e7\u00f5es de dinoquistos \napresentaram uma diversidade reduzida, sendo fortemente dominadas pelo peridi-\nni\u00f3ide eurialino Subtilisphaera sp.. As infer\u00eancias paleoambientais e paleoecol\u00f3gicas \nautorizadas pelos dinoquistos foram consistentes com reconstitui\u00e7\u00f5es paleogeogr\u00e1-\nficas de um ambiente lagunar propostas anteriormente para o Cenomaniano m\u00e9-\ndio da regi\u00e3o da Nazar\u00e9. A idade sugerida da sucess\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica, com base nas \nassocia\u00e7\u00f5es de dinoquistos, foi cenomaniana inferior a superior, mais tardia do que \na idade cenomaniana inferior a m\u00e9dia suportada pela converg\u00eancia de v\u00e1rios outros \nindicadores bioestratigr\u00e1gicos.

The studied section has a proposed \n\nlate early-middle Cenomanian age, and has been interpreted as recording a transition \n\nfrom an open inner shelf during the late early Cenomanian to a marginal-marine \n\nlagoonal environment at the early middle Cenomanian. A total of 11 bulk samples \n\nwere collected from four marly layers selected along the section and subsequently \n\nprepared for microscopic analysis following standard palynological techniques. \n\nNine of them yielded a diversified palynological content, including dinocysts, \n\nmiospores, foraminifera test linings, blue-green algae and acritarchs. Dinocysts \n\nassemblages presented a relatively low diversity and were strongly dominated by \n\nthe euryhaline peridinioid Subtilisphaera sp.. Dinocysts-based palaeoenvironmental \n\nand palaeoecological inferences were consistent with previous palaeogeographic \n\nreconstructions of a mid-Cenomanian lagoonal setting for the Nazar\u00e9 range. The \n\nsuggested age of the sampled succession, when based on dinocysts, is older than \n\nthe upper Cenomanian, but higher than the lower to middle Cenomanian dating \n\nrobustly supported by several other biostratigraphic markers. No improvement of the \n\nbiostratigraphic resolution of Cenomanian substages could be obtained. Comparisons \n\nwith coeval dinocysts assemblages of Northwest Europe and Upper Cretaceous \n\nassemblages of the Castilian Platform were mostly supportive of a highly specific local \n\nmid-Cenomaninan palaeoenvironment in the Nazar\u00e9 sector, with characteristics of \n\na lagoonal type.\n\nKey-words: Dinoflagellate cysts, Biostratigraphy, Palaeoecology, Cenomanian, \n\nNazar\u00e9 (West Portugal).\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n1.

PRESENTATION AND PERTINENCE OF THE THEME\n\nThe Western Portuguese Carbonate Platform (WPCP) is one of several European \n\nand North-African extended rimmed shelves that bordered the northern branch \n\nof the Tethyan Realm during a long term interval of worldwide sea level increase \n\nand eustatic highstand that occurred at the middle part of Cretaceous Period (e.g. \n\nHaq, 2014; Hancock &amp; Kaufman, 1979; Hardenbol et al., 1998; Hart, 1990). Its \n\ndepositional setting is related to the Cretaceous development of the Estremadura \n\nand Beira Litoral onshore sectors of the West Iberian Margin, after the post-rifting \n\nstage of the Lusitanian Basin (Wilson, 1988; Wilson, Hiscott, Willis, &amp; Gradstein, \n\n1989; Pinheiro, Wilson, Reis, Whitmarsh, &amp; Ribeiro, 1996; Kullberg, Rocha, Soares, \n\nRey, Terrinha, et al., 2006; Rey, Dinis, Callapez, &amp; Cunha, 2006; Dinis, Rey, Cunha, \n\nCallapez, &amp; Reis 2008). Gradually settled during the Albian and Cenomanian stages \n\nand persisting to the end of Lower Turonian, its carbonate facies are presently widely \n\ndocumented along the onshore of the Western Portuguese Margin or Mesocenozoic \n\nWest Portuguese Border (Soares &amp; Rocha, 1984), in between the parallels of Aveiro \n\nand Lisbon (Callapez, 2008). Due to its location between North and Central \n\nAtlantic and North Africa, the WPCP has been the subject of recurrent interest \n\nconcerning the biotic differentiation and mixing across the Tethyan and Temperate \n\nrealms, particularly as regards the biogeographical distribution of rudist reefs and reef \n\nbuilding corals, other benthic faunas and ammonites (Callapez, 2008).\n\nAmong the Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate exposures, the one of Nazar\u00e9, \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChapter 1\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n14\n\nadjoining the fishing village by the same name (see Fig. 1A and B), occupies a hinge \n\nposition between the northern and the southern domains of the WPCP which, \n\nespecially after the middle Cenomanian, display rather distinct facies: limestones \n\nwith rudists and coral buildups at the south, and marly limestones with ammonites \n\nat the north (Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1984d; Berthou, \n\nChancellor, &amp; Lauverjat, 1985; Berthou &amp; Lauverjat, 1979; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, \n\n1998).\n\nThis outcrop presents an extended Late Cretaceous sequence, ranging from \n\n\u201cBellasian\u201d (Choffat\u2019s (1900) sensu) layers of Albian/early Cenomanian age to the \n\nlower Turonian (still additionally overlain by Campanian-Maastrichtian siliciclastics) \n\n(Antunes, 1979), and its thick succession of Cenomanian lagoonal marls and \n\nlimestones are particularly suitable to the study of fossil content (Callapez et al., \n\n2014). For those reasons, it has long been the subject of systematic stratigraphical \n\nand palaeontological studies (for a review, see Callapez, 1998, 2008; Hart et al., 2005). \n\nDistinct macro and micro faunas have been considered in local biostratigraphical \n\nand palaeoenvironmental studies, or in regional ones that included Nazar\u00e9. After the \n\npioneering monographs of Paul Choffat (1849-1919), whose datings were mainly \n\nbased on ammonite assemblages (Choffat, 1898, 1900), the French workers Pierre-\n\nYves Berthou (1973, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1984d) and Jacques Lauverjat (1982) \n\nreviewd aspects of the biostratigraphical setting and resorted to foraminifera and \n\nostracods as stratigraphical biomarkers integrated with ammonoids, echinoids and \n\nother additional biostratigraphical data. More recently, cephalopod (particularly \n\nammonites) assemblages (Callapez, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2008; Callapez &amp; Soares, \n\n2001; Barroso-Barcenilla, Callapez, Soares, &amp; Segura, 2011) and the foraminifera \n\nbiostratigraphy (Hart et al., 2005) were thoroughly revised from the 1990s onward, \n\ntogether with detailed analysys of macrobenthic invertebrate associations (Callapez, \n\n1998, 2008) and vertebrate remains of the Cenomanian lagoonal levels, including \n\nfish, turtle, and crocodyliform specimens (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014), for \n\nbiostratigraphic and palaeoecological purposes. \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n -\n\n A\n.

The above \n\nmentioned studies are, to the best of our knowledge, the only ones tackling the \n\nUpper Cretaceous in Portugal, confirming the scarcity of dinocyst-based studies \n\nof the Portuguese, and more generally Iberian, Canomanian-Turonian signaled in \n\nPeyrot (2011). \n\nConsidering the previous scenery, the present work arises as the first step of \n\na new scientific project concearning the palynological research of dinoflagellates \n\nand dinocysts in the Upper Cretaceous of Portugal. Particularly, it focuses the study \n\nof a stratigraphical section sampled in the basal marl and limestone beds exposed \n\nin the south side of the Nazar\u00e9 promontory, with an upper lower to basal middle \n\nCenomanian record, and a particular focus on the preliminary quantitative study \n\nof organic-walled dinocysts. From a palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological \n\nstandpoint, this particular section has been interpreted as recording the transition \n\nfrom an open inner shelf during the late early Cenomanian to a more constrained \n\nlagoonal environment in the mid part of this stage (Callapez et al., 2014). \n\n1.2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \n\nAs an interdisciplinary work that focuses integrated aspects of general stratigraphy, \n\ntaxonomy of organic-walled dinocysts and palaeoecology, the present study is \n\ncentered on several general and specific main objectives.\n\nThe general aim of the research is to detail our knowledge on the dinoflagellate \n\ncysts from the early to lower Cenomanian transition in the shallow carbonate facies \n\nof the WPCP at the locality of Nazar\u00e9, one of the main sections for the study of this \n\ntime span in the West Portuguese Margin.  \n\nTaken as specific objectives, the purported goals of the study are: \n\n(1) To complement previous local biostratigraphic analyses of the basal section of\n\nthe carbonate formation by using dinocyst-based data as an additional biotic\n\ncalibration;\n(2) To use the acknowledged potential of dinocyst assemblages as palaeoenviron-\n\nmental tracers, and their marked provincialism, to enhance the reconstruction\n\nof local palaeogeographical domains and their associated palaecology in the\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nlower and middle Cenomanian (much less studied in the Iberian Peninsula \n\nthan the upper Cenomanian and Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, associated \n\nwith the Bonarelli Event; e.g., Callapez, 2001, 2003; Hart et al., 2005; Barroso-\n\nBarcenilla et al., 2011); \n\n(3) To obtain an exploratory view of the similarities and differences with the \n\nassociations of dinocysts taxa in stratigraphically equivalent regions in NW \n\nEurope (Lignum, 2009); as noticed in Berthou et al. (1980), dinocysts of \n\nthe Mesogean (Tethyan) province are less known than those of the Boreal \n\nprovince and might contribute to an understanding of the palaeogeographical \n\ndifferentiation/articulation between them;\n\n(4) To contribute thereby to an integrated approach for a better knowledge of \n\nTethyan carbonate platforms in the Iberian Peninsula, within the geodynamic \n\ncontext of the Atlantic and Mediterranean margins.\n\n1.3. STRUCTURE OF THE WORK\n\nThe dissertation unfolds across 8 chapters, including the present one (Introduction) and \n\na final discussion at the end. Chapter 2 presents the main geological setting, including \n\nan overall characterization of the Lusitanian Basin and the Western Portuguese \n\nCarbonate Platform (WPCP). Chapter 3 presents the stratigraphical framework \n\nat several levels, moving from a characterization of the Cenomanian-Turonian \n\nstratigraphy of the carbonate platform to a more focused stratigraphical description \n\nof the Nazar\u00e9 sector, and finally narrowing down to the stratigraphic column elected \n\nfor study, located at the base of the southern exposures of the Nazar\u00e9 promontory. \n\nChapter 4 conveys the essentials of dinoflagellates biology and morphology. Chapter 5 \n\naddresses the taxonomic, biostratigraphic (cyst zonations) and palaeoecological issues \n\nrelated to the use of dinocysts as biomarkers, while also including a quick overview \n\nof dynocyst-based studies conducted in Portugal. Chapters 6 and 7 constitute the \n\nempirical part of the dissertation. The methods (e.g., the sampling of the geological \n\ncolumn) and procedures (pre-laboratorial and laboratorial processing, leading to the \n\nmicroscopic analysis of the palynological content in the samples) are described in \n\nchapter 6. Chapter 7 presents the analyzed data under the form of tables, graphs, and \n\nsummary statistics, and characterizes them with a view to their biostratigraphical \n\nand palaeoecological significance. Chapter 8, under the heading of \u201cfinal discussion\u201d, \n\nsummarizes the main findings, discusses the limits and scope of the study, and tackles \n\ndirections for future research.\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\nThe Lower part of the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary record in Portugal is mainly \n\nrepresented by the West Portuguese Carbonate Platform (WPCP) in the West-Central \n\npart of the continental margin of Iberia (Berthou, 1984b; Callapez, 1998). From a \n\ngeological standpoint, the WPCP is related to the the Cretaceous development of \n\nthe onshore sector of the Western Iberian (Portuguese) Margin, after the end of the \n\ndistensive phase of the Lusitanian Basin in the late Aptian (Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg \n\net al., 2006; Pinheiro et al., 1996) and during a long-term Albian to Late Cenomian \n\neustatic sea-level rise leading to the formation of a number of European and North-\n\nAfrican shallow marine carbonate platforms along the borders of the northern branch \n\not the Tethyan Realm (Callapez, 2004, 2008). \n\nThis platform overlies a nearly 5000 m thick Triassic to Jurassic and Early \n\nCretaceous sedimentary record reflecting the geotectonic evolution of the Lusitanian \n\nBasin (Fig. 1A) across several rifting and post-tecnonic relaxation intervals (Rocha \n\n&amp; Soares, 1984), until the formation of ocean crust wich marks the transition of the \n\nWestern Central Portuguese margin to a passive margin (Callapez, 2008; Kullberg \n\net al., 2014). While depositional processes occurring in the passive margin were no \n\nlonger genetically associated with the rifting Basin (Kullberg et al., 2014), they were \n\nstill constrained by its deep structuring into several sectors on the basis of a system of \n\ninherited late-Variscan faults and salt tectonics (Ribeiro et al., 1979). \n\nThe main litostratigraphic units of these sectors (Northern, Central and \n\nSouthern sectors, according to Rocha and Soares, 1984: see Fig. 2A) have been a \n\nlongstanding subject of study from diverse standpoints (e.g., lithological, stratigraphic, \n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n20\n\nsedimentary, palaeographical) and underwent consecutive revisions (see Kullberg, \n\n2000, for an overview). Specificically for the Cretaceous onshore sedimentary \n\nrecord of the Western Central Portuguese Margin, a litostratigraphic synthesis, along \n\nwith an interpretation of the main allogenic controls, is provided by Dinis et al. \n\n(2008), ranging from Berrasian to Middle Campanian-Maastrichtian deposits (see \n\nFig. 1C) and distinguishing between a Northern and a Southern sector (separated \n\nby the Caldas da Rainha parallel). Transgressive and regressive episodes, under both \n\neustatic and tectonic control, played a fundamental role in the deposition history, \n\nwith transgressive events usually marked by carbonate intercalations and carbonate \n\nplatforms (Dinis et al., 2008, Kullberg et al., 2006). In particular, after a regressive \n\ntrend during the late Aptian and the Aptian-Albian transition (Moron 1981), a long-\n\nterm eustatic rise with an Albian onset gave way to the diachronic establishement \n\nof a carbonate platform in the southern domain (region of Lisbon), at first, and \n\nextending progressivelly up North all along the Cenomanian, to reach a maximum of \n\ncarbonate sedimentation (full infill of the Lusitanian Basin) during the initial Upper \n\nCenomanien (Callapez, 2008; Dinis et al., 2008) (see Fig. 2B). After this maximal \n\nCretaceous transgression, the carbonate platform underwent a regressive episode \n\n(associated with an uplift of the continental margin), with progradation and fluvial \n\nincision, but still persisted to the end of Lower Turonian, after which it consistently \n\ngave way to the progradation of micaceous alluvial sands over realms of the platform \n\n(Callapez, 2004, 2008). \n\nThe Cretaceous carbonate outcrops of the Western Portuguese Margin are \n\nirregularly spread along the coastline in between the parallels of Aveiro and Lisbon, \n\nfollowing the overall NNE-SSW orientation of the passive margin (see Fig. 1B). \n\nReflecting the additional role of NE-SW and E-W oriented reactivated hercyinian \n\nfaults and regional halokynetic structures, leading to somewhat different tectonic-\n\nsedimentary evolutions for different regions, a northern and a southern domain can \n\nbe distinguished, delimited by the tectonic axis Caldas da Rainha-Nazar\u00e9-Pombal \n\n(Callapez, 1998, 2008; Dinis, Rey, Cunha, Callapez, &amp; Reis, 2008; Dinis et al., 2015:). \n\nLower Cretaceous sequences, namely Albian marine and lower Cenomanian, are \n\nonly clearly identified in the southern domain, while the later phases of deposition, \n\nnamely marine Lower Turonian, are only represented in the northern domain \n\n(Berthou et al., 1980), with a broad representation of a middle Cenomanian \n\nto lower Turonian carbonate platform, and of later Turonian to Maastrichtian \n\nmarine and fluvial siliciclastics (Dinis, Rey, Cunha, Callapez, &amp; Reis, 2008).   \n\n\n\nGeological setting\n\n21\n\nFigure 2 - A.

Palaeogeographic \nmap of Late Cretaceous marine deposition; lines numbered 1 to 6 indicate the probable position of the \nshoreline form midle Albian to late Cenomanian (maximal Cretaceous transgression) (adapted from Montenat \net al., 1988).\n\nIn addition to their distinct ages and stratigraphic facies, these two domains have \n\nalso been recognized as distinct palaeogeographic and palaeoclimate realms, with \n\nsignificant palaeoecological implications regarding the distribution and diversity of \n\nshallow-water marine biota (Callapez, 1998, 2008). Contrasting to the setting up of \n\na rimmed platform displaying a predominance of coral reef complexes and rudist \n\nbuild-ups in the southern domain, open platform domains developed in the northern \n\nsector with a prodominance of ammonite facies along with benthic faunas (Berthou, \n\n1973, 1984b; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008). Domain diversity, wich \n\nwas also favoured by local uplift movements along the diapiric axes, was greater \n\nin the northern sector after the initial upper Cenomanian major transgression, \n\nexhibiting strong lateral variation in facies (Callapez, 1998, 2003, 2004). Thanks to \n\nits palaeoenvironmental diversity (inner shelfs, reefs, lagoons, aluvial plains, etc.) and \n\nits linkage to the evolution of the West Iberian Margin in between the Northern \n\n\n\nGeological setting\n\n23\n\nand Central Atlantic and the African plate, the Cenomanian-Turonian Carbonate \n\nPlatform has a distinctive importance for the overall articulation between the Tethyan \n\nand the Boreal realms (Berthou et al., 1980; Dinis &amp; Cunha, 2004), particularly as \n\nregards the understanding of faunal change and mixing between Northern Tethys, \n\nNorth-Africa and the Temperate Domain of West Europe (Callapez, 2008). \n\nThe present study will be concerned with the base of the Upper Cretaceous \n\nCenomanian platform, with a focus on the region of Nazar\u00e9. As indicated above, Nazar\u00e9 \n\noccupies a hinge position in between the northern and the southern palaeogeographic \n\ndomains. The Lower Cretaceous series, best represented in the Lisbon Peninsula, \n\ncan still be documented at the exposures of Nazar\u00e9, which additionally present a \n\nrich depositional series for the entire Cenomanian, including a brecciated endokarst \n\ncorrelative of the Cenomanian-Turonian transition that stands as a first sign of the \n\nfuture inversion of the basin (Berthou et al., 1980; Corrochano, Reis, &amp; Armenteros, \n\n1998; Dinis &amp; Cunha, 2004; Reis, Corrochano, &amp; Armenteros, 1997; Callapez, 2014) \n\nThe identity of this boundary region as regards both the Lisbon Peninsula and the \n\nnorthern subdomain has allowed for the further distinction between a northern and \n\na central sector of the carbonate platform in the Cenomanian-Turonian sucessions \n\n(Callapez, 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n3.1. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH\n\nThe study of the Portuguese Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate units has a century-\n\nold tradition. Research was initiated by Daniel Sharpe (1806-1856) during the \n\ndecades of 1830-40, among other XIXth century pionneers, and continued by Paul \n\nChoffat (1849-1919) and collaborators, from 1880 until the beginning of XX century. \n\nAs a Swiss geologist based in Portugal, Choffat collaborated with the Geological \n\nCommission of the Kingdom for the detailed description of the stratigraphy, \n\npalaeontology and cartography of the Portuguese Mesozoic (Antunes, 1986). His \n\nfirst major study on the Cretaceous System dates back to 1885, and the section of \n\nNazareth was described in 1894 attached to the monograph by Gaston de Saporta \n\n(1823-1895) on palaeobotany.\n\nFrom 1960s onwards the works of Soares (e.g., 1966, 1972, 1980), focusing \n\nparticularly on the region of Baixo Mondego, provided important contributions \n\n(Fran\u00e7a &amp; Zbyszewski, 1963). In the 1970s and 1980s, studies by P.-Y. Berthou, J. \n\nLauverjat and collaborators have allowed the establishment of new biostratigraphic \n\nscales for the Cenomanian-Turonian (e.g., Berthou, 1984a, 1984b, Berthou et al., \n\n1980, 1985). Special note is due to the monographs by Berthou (1973) and Lauverjat \n\n(1982), where the outcrop of Nazar\u00e9 was again taken up and its microfacies and \n\nassociations of foraminifera and ostracods were addressed.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, this study was resumed and the stratigraphy and \n\ninvertebrates content revised north of Nazar\u00e9 (e.g., Callapez, 1998, 2008). Foraminifera \n\nSTRATIGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK:  \nTHE CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN PLATFORM \n\nCARBONATES OF WEST PORTUGAL\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n26\n\nbiostratigraphy was tackled by Hart et al. (2005) and the ammonite biostratigraphy \n\nsynthesized in Barroso-Barcenilla et al. (2011). The section of Nazar\u00e9 was remade by \n\nCallapez (1998, 2001) and Callapez et al. (2014), including the study of the vertebrates \n\nof Cenomanian lagoonal levels.\n\nThe vast majority of these and other studies to date addressed stratigraphic \n\nsuccessions located across the onshore regions of Estremadura and Beira Litoral, from \n\nLisbon to Figueira da Foz and Nazar\u00e9-Leiria-Coimbra, which may be classified into \n\none of the three sectors mentioned above: northern, central and southern.\n\n3.2. GENERAL LITOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOSTRATIGRAPHY\n\nThe Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate series is part of a megasequence ranging from \n\nLate Aptian to Early Campanian in age (Cunha, 1992; Cunha &amp; Reis, 1995), which \n\ncomprises a succession of (1) alluvial coarse siliciclastic sediments and interbededed \n\nlutites drained westwards from the Hercynian Massif of Iberia, (2) open and rimmed \n\nplatform carbonates, (3) marine to alluvial micaceous sandstones (best represented \n\nin the northeast areas of the onshore, and (4) alluvial sandstones and conglomerates \n\n(Callapez, 2004). Within this general sequence, the carbonate platform facies are \n\nmiddle Albian-early Turonian in age and are in turn articulated in two megasequences \n\ndelimited by clear unconformities (Callapez, 1998; Dinis et al., 2008; Rey et al., 2006). \n\nThe first megasequence records Albian to Upper Cenomanian marginal marine \n\nfacies and includes only a limited representation of Albian carbonate sedimentation, \n\nbasically limited to the Lisbon/Sintra region. The second megasequence is Turonian \n\nand has its depocentre in the Northern sector. \n\nThe middle Albian-middle Cenomanian carbonate succession of the first \n\nmegasequence was first studied in the southern region by Choffat, in 1885, who \n\nproposed the following units, defined by the marine fossils content, from base to the \n\ntop: 1) the Knemiceras uhligi level; 2) the Polyconites subverneuilli recifal level; 3) the \n\nExogyra pseudafricana [Ilymatogyra] level; 4) the Pterocera incerta [Harpagodes] level. These \n\nmarl and limestone units, around 400 m thick, are overlain by a bed with the ammonite \n\nNeolobites vibrayeanus and a further level with \u2018rudist limestones\u2019 (systematic update \n\nsensu Callapez, 2003) (Callapez, 2004, 2008), both upper Cenomanian in age. The \n\ndesignation of \u201cBellasian\u201d was used by Choffat (1885, 1900) as a chronostratigraphic \n\nunit aggregating the four levels described beneath the bed with the ammonite \n\nNeolobites vibrayeanus. More detailed biostratigraphic research led to the attribution of \n\n\n\nStratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal\n\n27\n\nan Albian age to the two lower levels (1 and 2), redefined as the Gal\u00e9 Formation (Rey, \n\n1992, 2007), and to the dating of levels 3 and 4, redefined as the Cane\u00e7as Formation, \n\nas, respectively, lower and middle Cenomanian (Rey, Dinis, Callapez &amp; Cunha, 2006). \n\nThe thickness of the old \u201cBellasian\u201d unit of Choffat is strongly reduced towards north. \n\nOnly the middle Cenomanian level with Pterocera incerta, displaying a mixed facies \n\nof sandy and marly limestones and sandy marls, can be found north of Torres Vedras, \n\nbut associated with a marked retrogradation of the carbonate facies with ostreids and \n\nexogirinids (Callapez, 2004, 2008). However, the lower Cenomanian bed composed \n\nof marly limestones with biostromes of Exogyra pseudafricana still occurs across the \n\nEstremadura and in the exposures of Nazar\u00e9, in the Central sector (Callapez, 2008; \n\nCallapez et al., 2014). \n\nAs for the middle Cenomanian-lower Turonian interval in the first megasequence, \n\nthe basal upper Cenomanian is marked by a transgressive surface observable in all \n\nsectors of the onshore and recorded by a significant increase of fully carbonate facies \n\nof nodular limestone and marly limestone with ammonites, nautiloids and a diverse \n\nbenthic fauna of open shelf environments (Callapez, 2004; Barcenilla et al., 2011). \n\nThe most expanded sequences for this interval (\u201cBeds with Neolobites vibrayeanus\u201d of \n\nChoffat, 1989, 1900), which also present the richest biostratigraphically significant \n\nfossil content, outcrop both in the northern sector, near Figueira da Foz (Soares, \n\n1980; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008), and the southern sector, in Nazar\u00e9 and near Runa \n\nand Lisbon (Berthou, 1973, 1984a; Lauverjat, 1982). \n\nThe type area for the upper Cenomanian carbonate succession was established by \n\nChoffat (1897, 1900) and followed by subsequent workers (e.g., Berthou &amp; Lauverjat, \n\n1974; Soares, 1980) at the site of Salmanha, near Figueira da Foz (Costa d\u2019Arnes \n\nFormation), due to the best individualization of ammonite rich stratigraphic levels \n\neasily correlated with sections from other areas of the carbonate platform. The original \n\nsuccession of Salmanha comprises 14 levels ordered from \u201cB\u201d to \u201cO\u201d, which can be \n\nindividualized by their lithofacies, fossil content, including ammonites, inoceramids \n\nand foraminifera, and are most often bounded by discontinuities (Choffat, 1897, 1898, \n\n1900; Berthou &amp; Lauverjat, 1974; Soares, 1980; Rocha, Manuppella, Mouterde, Ruget, \n\n&amp; Zbyszewski, 1981; Lauverjat, 1982; Berthou, 1984a, Berthou, 1973, 1984a, 1984b, \n\n1984c, 1984d; Berthou et al., 1985; Callapez, 1998, 2001, 2004; Callapez &amp; Soares, \n\n2001; Barcenilla et al., 2011). According to the cumulated biostratigraphic evidence \n\n(e.g., levels C to J are late Cenomanian in age, with \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d corresponding to \n\nthe basal upper Cenomanian, and the first lower Turonian deposits (level \u201cK\u201d) laying \n\non top of \u201cJ\u201d (Callapez, 1998).\n\nThe lower part of the upper Cenomanian, displaying as a set of nodular and \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n28\n\nmarly limestones, occurs accross the whole basin, corresponding to the beds with \n\nthe Tethyan ammonite Neolobites vibrayeanus (Berthou, 1984a) which, together with \n\nan overlying thick succession of \u201crudists limestone\u201d, constitute the Bica Formation \n\n(Rey et al., 2006). \n\nIn the upper part of the upper Cenomanian record three geographic ranges \n\nwith distinct associations of facies can be reccognised: (1) Rimmed shelf limestones \n\nwith rudists and coral buildups south of Leiria (towards Lisbon); (2) Open shelf \n\nmarly limestones with ammonites north of Leiria (towards Figueira da Foz and \n\nCoimbra); and (3) inner shelf and lagoonal marls with echinoids and ostreids East \n\nof Leiria (around Our\u00e9m) (Choffat, 1900; Berthou et al., 1980; Berthou, 1984a). The \n\ncorrespondences between these distinct ranges, particularly the two main ammonite \n\nand rudists associations of facies, have been the subject of a number of stratigraphic \n\nand palaeontological studies (e.g., Choffat 1898, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Berthou &amp; \n\nLauverjat, 1979; Crosaz-Galletti, 1979; Moron, 1981; Lauverjat 1982; Callapez, 1998; \n\nBarcenilla et al., 2011) and are now better understood (Berthou, 1984a), allowing for \n\nan overall stratigraphic framework (see Fig. 2 A and B).\n\n\n\nStratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal\n\n29\n\nFigure 4 - A. General stratigraphy of of the carbonate succession in the northern sector, from Figueira da \nFoz inward, with standard ammonites biozones (after Hart el al., 2005, modified after Callapez, 1998). B. \nGeneral stratigraphy of the Cenomanian-Turonian from the onshore sectors of the West Portuguese Margin \neastwards of Nazar\u00e9 (after Callapez, 2008).\n\nThis first Albian-upper Cenomanian megasequence presents a regressive facies \n\nat its top boundary (unit \u201dJ\u201d), followed by a hiatus and a karstified surface (Baixo \n\nMondego and Nazar\u00e9) marking the Cenomanian-Turonian transition unconformity \n\n(e.g., Callapez, 2004; Dinis et al., 2008): This discontinuity is related to the overall \n\nuplift of the continental margin, resulting in the emersion and subaerial exposure of \n\nthe onshore sections of the carbonate platform (Callapez, 2008).\n\nThe second megasequence, which is entirely Turonian in age, is recorde by units \n\n\u201cK\u201d to \u201cO\u201d of Choffat (1897, 1900), with a maximal thickness of 18 m in the type \n\narea (Salmanha, Figueira da Foz). With the exception of a narrow set of exposures \n\nalong the southest southeast block of the C\u00f3s-Leiria-Pombal fault (central sector), \n\nit is restricted to the northern sector. The \u201cK\u201d and \u201cL\u201d levels correspond to the basal \n\nlower Turonian, starting with dolomitic marls which evolve to platy marly limestones \n\nincluding abundant concentrations of reoriented turritelids (Callapez, 2004). \n\nAmmonite associations mainly occur in level \u201cL\u201d, dominated by vascoceratids of the \n\nmiddle lower Turonian Tethyan biozone of Thomasites rollandi (Chancellor, Kennedy, \n\n&amp; Hancock, 1994). This correlation concurs with the additional common occurrence \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n30\n\nof inoceramids Mytiloides spp. among the fossil fauna (Callapez, 1998, 2003, 2004). The \n\ncorrelative depositional sequence in the central sector (southeast block of the C\u00f3s-\n\nLeiria-Pombal) consists in 2-3 m thick marls with rudist (Radiolites peroni) biostromes.\n\nThe upper part of the lower Turonian is represented by units \u201cM\u201d, \u201cN\u201d and \n\n\u201cO\u201d, consisting of a succession with cross-bedded inner shelf grainstones with \n\ncoral and rudist debris and an increasing upwards content in micaceous sandstones \n\n(Soares, 1980; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008; Hart et al., 2005.) This late \n\nsequence shows no record of ammonites, but the occurence of Actaeonella caucasica \n\ngrossouvrei suggests a late early Turonian age (Callapez, 1993). Also, Berthou (1984b) \n\ninferred a possible correlation with the standard zone of Mammites nodosoides based \n\nin palynological data provided by micaceous sandstones sampled at the region of \n\nCoimbra. This sequence presents a strong regressive character, documenting a \n\ntransition to littoral plain and alluvial micaceous standstones (Furadouro Formation), \n\nculminating with a withdrawal of the sea from the onshore sectors of the Western \n\nPortuguese margin (Callapez, 2008). The correlative sediments in the Central sector \n\n(recorded at the top of the exposures of Nazar\u00e9) correspond to coarse sands with \n\nabraded fragments of radiolitids and actaeonellids, consistent with a shallow littoral \n\ndomain with prograding alluvial sandy bars (Callapez, 2004, 2008).\n\n3.3. LOCAL STRATIGRAPHIC SETTING: THE \u201cS\u00cdTIO DA NAZAR\u00c9 \n\nFORMATION\u201d\n\nAs mentioned before, tectonic activity associated with late Hercynian structural faults \n\nof diverse orientation led to the differentiation of several palaeogeographical regions \n\nin the carbonate platform (Callapez, 1998). The predominant NE-SW C\u00f3s-Leiria-\n\nPombal flexure and fault system (\u201cNazar\u00e9 fault\u201d) (Dinis, Lopes, Rodrigues, &amp; Cunha, \n\n2012; Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg, Rocha, Soares, Duarte, &amp; Marques, 2014) played a \n\nmajor role in the distinction between a northern, a central, and a southern region, but \n\nother sets of faults with NNW\u2013SSE to NW-SE and with submeridian to meridian \n\n(N-S to NNE-SSW) orientations additionally contributed to the differentiation of \n\nstructural domains within each region (Callapez, op. cit). In the northern sector, the \n\nCenomanian-Turonian outcrops of the Baixo-Mondego Region are thus commonly \n\ndivided in different structural and palaeogeographical domains, displaying marked \n\nlateral facies variation (Choffat, 1900; Soares, 1966, 1968, 1980): Figueira da Foz, \n\nMontemor-o-Velho, Tent\u00fagal and East of Ribeira de An\u00e7\u00e3 (Callapez, 1992, 1998). \n\n\n\nStratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal\n\n31\n\nIn the Central sector, four structural domains have also been distinguished in the \n\noutcrops exposed over the southeast region of the C\u00f3s-Leiria-Pombal: (1) Nazar\u00e9; \n\n(2) Alpedriz syncline, (3) Pousos syncline and (4) Our\u00e9m (Choffat, 1900; Berthou,\n\n1973; Crosaz, 1975, 1976; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004). The stratigraphic\n\nsuccession analyzed in this study is included in the Nazar\u00e9 sector, which constitutes\n\nthe most western (external) domain of the Nazar\u00e9-Leiria-Our\u00e9m region, bordered at\n\neast by the northern end of the diapiric anticline of Caldas da Rainha, and presenting\n\nthe most complete upper Cretaceous carbonate series in the central sector.\n\nThe single Cenomanian-Turonian outcrop found in the Nazar\u00e9 sector corresponds \n\nto the large promontory which dominates the fishing village of Nazar\u00e9, located south, \n\nin the foothill (see Fig. 5A and B), with cliffs and slopes cutting Cenomanian massive \n\nlimestones (e.g., Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Lauverjat, 1982; Hart et al., 2005; \n\nCallapez, 2004; Callapez et al., 2014) (see Fig. 5C). As stated in section 2.1 (historical \n\noverview of research), both the stratigraphy and the fossil content of this outcrop have \n\nbeen the subject of much prior research since the pionnering works of Choffat (1886, \n\n1900, 1901-02) and Saporta (1894, including an appendix with the first description \n\nof the stratigraphic section by Choffat), benefiting from cumulative contributions \n\nof further sedimentological, palynological, palaeoecological and micro- and macro-\n\nfaunal analyses (e.g., Antunes, 1979; Barroso-Barcenilla et al., 2011; Berthou, 1973, \n\n1984a; Berthou et al., 1985; Reis, Corrochano, &amp; Armentero, 1997; Callapez, 1998, \n\n2001, 2004; Callapez &amp; Soares, 2001; Callapez et al., 2014; Lauverjat, 1982). An overall \n\ndescription of the stratigraphic setting of Nazar\u00e9 is provided in the following.\n\nThe sedimentary succession from the base of the promontory upwards displays \n\nthe following main sequences (description closely following Callapez, 1998; Callapez, \n\n2004; Callapez et al., 2014): \n\n1) Albian to lower Cenomanian marine sandstones and lutites with plant remains\n\n(ca. 30 meters of exposure, recording the upper part of the Figueira da Foz Fm.); \n\n2) Upper lower Cenomanian littoral plain mixed facies with Ilymatogyra pseudafricana\n\nand Ceratostreon flabellatum biostromes, changing laterally to inner shelf\n\ncarbonates rich in benthic invertebrates and occasional turtle remains (level \n\nwith Exogyra pseudoafricana from Choffat\u2019s \u201cBellasian\u201d; 1 to 8 meters thick); \n\n3) Middle Cenomanian laminated marls and mudstones interbedded with\n\noyster pavements and biostromes of Gyrostrea ouremensis, overlain at the top\n\nby massive dolomitic beds with fish remains; this unit, which also contains\n\nvertebrates remains and ichtyological fauna, crocodile and chelonians, is 39\n\nmeters thick and corresponds to unit \u201cB\u201d of Choffat, signaling a shift from\n\nan open inner platform environment to a lagoonal environment;\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n32\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 A.

This succession and the associated transgressive \n\nsurface are easily identified in the whole carbonate platform, allowing and \n\naccurate stratigraphic correlation; \n\n5) Upper Cenomanian massive beds of withish calcarenitic limestone with a \n\nrich invertebrate fauna of bivalves, gastropods and echinoids (circa 4 m), \n\ncorresponding to unit \u201cD\u201d of Choffat (\u201cBed with Anorthopygus michelini\u201d). \n\n6) On the top the previous beds a narrow layer (few centimeters thick) of pinkish \n\nto beige yellowish nodular limestone including abundant Tylostoma ovatum, \n\nHelicaulax sp. and Drepanocheilus sp. can be observed, as a record of unit \u201cE\u201d \n\n(Callapez, 1998). \n\nUnits \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d constitute the easternmost part of the upper edge of \n\nthe promontory on the south side, forming a cornice below the S\u00edtio da \n\nNazar\u00e9. More westward, still on the south side, Choffat\u2019s levels \u201cF\u201d, \u201cG\u201d and \n\n\u201cH\u201d are represented by a succession of outer reef limestones with Caprinula \n\ndebris, one of the most typical groups of rudists from the upper Cenomanian \n\nTethyan faunas (circa 21 m); \n\n7) The highest upper Cenomanian record, corresponding to levels \u201cI\u201d/\u201dJ\u201c (more \n\neasily observable on the western cliff), is composed of laminated limestones \n\nand heavily bioturbated marls, probably correlative of the Bonarelli event \n\nand affected by the early development of a well exposed intra-Cretaceous \n\nendokarst (Callapez et al., 2014; Corrochano, Reis, &amp; Armentero, 1998; Reis \n\net al., 1997).\n\nThe units from the top part of the Cenomanian-Turonian succession are exposed \n\non the western side of the promontory (light-house outcrop and north-beach), where \n\ntheir strata slightly dip northwards. Lower Turonian sequences are well documented \n\non the northern corner of the cliffs, resting unconformably on upper Cenomanian \n\nlimestones (unit \u201cJ\u201d, which in this realm corresponds to a 7 m sequence of marls and \n\nlimestones) (Callapez 2004). Basal lower Turonian (units K/L) is represented by white \n\nand pink limestone interbedded with layers of micaceous sandy limestone (5-6 m), \n\ncontaining abraded fragments of Radiolites peroni, Apricardia sp., scleractinian corals, \n\nand Actaeonella caucasica grossouvrei (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014). \n\nAn erosional surface associated with an abrupt change in facies signals the \nboundary between the \u201cK\u201d/\u201dL\u201d and \u201cM\u201d/\u201dO\u201d sequences. Over the micaceous \n\n\n\nStratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal\n\n35\n\nlimestones, 4,5 metres of yellow coarse sandstones with debris of Acataeonella caucasica \n\ngrossouvrei and Radiolites peroni correspond to Choffat\u2019s unit \u201cM\u201d, of middle lower \n\nTuronian age. \n\nFinally, overlaying unconformably the Cenomanian-Turonian series, a layer \n\nof Coniacian\u2013Santonian alluvial sandstones (circa 6 m), followed by a succession \n\nof Campanian-Maastichtian alluvial red mudstones interbedded with calciclastic \n\nconglomerates and red lutites with land gastropods (Antunes, 1979), closes at the top \n\nthe Late Cretaceous exposures of Nazar\u00e9 (Callapez, 2004; Callapez et al., 2014).\n\nA stratigraphic profile of the Nazar\u00e9 carbonate succession, ranging from Lower to \n\nbasal Upper Cenomanian is illustrated above (Fig. 6, taken from Callapez et al., 2014). \n\nIn addition to sedimentary data, the fossil content, characterized by its abundance \n\nand diversity, is indicated. The significant LEP (Level with Exogyra pseudoafricana)/B \n\nand B/C stratigraphic discontinuities, respectively at the boundaries between the \n\nlower and middle Cenomanian and the middle and upper Cenomanian, are signaled \n\nin between levels 18-19 and 114-115. This profile is part of a more extended one \n\ncovering the entire Cenomanian-Turonian succession (until levels M/N/O) set up \n\nin Callapez (1998), starting at the base of the formation 400 meters west of the \n\nNorthern end of the Nazar\u00e9\u2019s beach (U.T.M. NE 93450 83990).\n\n3.4. SURVEYED STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE\n\nThe succession considered for study in this work starts at the base of the carbonate \n\nexposures on the south cliffs of Nazar\u00e9, in between the S\u00edtio and the Rock of Guilhim \n\n(39\u00b036\u201915.11\u201dN and 9\u00b04\u201955.26\u201dW) (see Fig. 7). It extends upwards for 13,5 meters, \n\ncovering an exposure of inner shelf and lagoonal marls and limestones of late early \n\nto middle Cenomanian age, with a view to examining its fossil content in dinocysts \n\nand other palynomorphs. \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n36\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre 7\n\n \u2013 P\nh\no\ntograph\n\n o\nf th\n\ne o\nu\ntcro\n\np sign\nalin\n\ng th\ne lo\n\ncatio\nn\n o\n\nf th\ne stu\n\ndied su\nccessio\n\nn\n by m\n\nean\ns o\n\nf a red fram\ne.

Around 5,5 m of the profile lie below the LEP/B discontinuity, and the \n\nremaining 8 m above it, but without reaching the B1/B2 discontinuity, which delimits \n\nthe early and latter middle Cenomanian (interval correlative to the standard ammonite \n\nzones of Rhotomagense and Jukes-brownwei, respectively) and occurs just below level 44 \n\nin the Callapez (1998) profile. This late early and early middle Cenomanian interval \n\nis coeval with the beginning of one of the most significant sea level rises in the \n\nCretaceous Period (Callapez et al., 2014; Gale et al., 2002; Haq, Hardenbol &amp; Vail, \n\n1988) and has been interpreted as relating to a palaeoenvironmental evolution from \n\nan open inner shelf close to an intertidal flat in the lower Cenomanian to a more \n\nconstrained lagoonal environment in the middle Cenomanian.\n\nThe section contains a succession of alternating limestones and marls with \n\nbiostromes of Ilymatogyra pseudoafricana, followed by laminitic marly levels with \n\nGyrostrea ouremensis. Upwards in the series the content in sands (sandy limestones) \n\nmarkedly decreases. From a litostratighraphic point of view, the layers represented in \n\nthe profile are partly equivalent to the Costa de Arnes Formation described by Rocha \n\net al. (1981) for the Figueira da Foz and Baixo Mondego regions, thus representing \n\nthe sector of the Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate located northward the Nazar\u00e9-\n\nLeiria-Pombal structural axis (Callapez, 1998; Dinis et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n39\n\n4.1. IMPORTANCE OF THE DINOFLAGELLATES\n\nDinoflagellates are unicellular microscopic organisms which, together with diatoms \n\nand coccolithophores, constitute an important part of the phytoplankton, closely \n\nfollowing diatoms as primary marine producers (Hoppenrath &amp; Saldarriaga, \n\n2012). Since about half of dinoflagellates species are actually heterotrophic and \n\nnot photosynthetic, they are also important members of the zooplankton, strongly \n\ncontributing to their taxonomic diversity and biomass (Gaines &amp; Elbr\u00e4chter, 1987). \n\nThey can be found in virtually all sorts of aquatic environments, ranging from \n\nmarine (the predominant case), to brackish and freshwater ecosystems to sea ice \n\n(Taylor, Hopenrath, &amp; Sladarriaga, 2008). Besides the planktonic forms, there are also \n\nbenthonic species. At particular stages of their life cycle Dinoflagellates may produce \n\ncysts with high potential to a successful fossilization, affording thereby important \n\nbiostratigraphical and palaeoecological information (Sousa, Ribas-Carballo, &amp; Pais, \n\n1999). \n\nConsistent fossil records of dinoflagellates have been established from Middle \n\nTriassic onwards (Fensome, Saldarriaga, &amp; Taylor, 1999). Despite some evidence for \n\nthe presence of the dinoflagellates lineage before the Mesozoic, the morphology of \n\ndinoflagellates as we know it today seems to have arisen from an evolutionary event \n\noccurred in the Early Mesozoic, thus making difficult to interpret fossils preceding \n\nthat period as dinoflagellates (Fensome et al., 1999). Around three quarters of the \n\ngenders and half of the species that have been described thus far are fossils (Taylor et al., \n\nDINOFLAGELLATES BIOLOGY \nAND MORPHOLOGY\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n40\n\n2008). Given the importance of dinoflagellate morphology for its identification and \n\nclassification, and its close connection to the dinoflagellate biology and life cycle, we \n\nprovide in this chapter a brief biological characterization of this important taxonomic \n\ngroup. The characterization offered is largely based on Evitt, Lentin, Millioud, Stover, \n\nand Williams (1977), Fensome et al. (1999), Medlin and Fensome (2013), and Sousa \n\net al. (1999). The database DINOFLAJ2 (Fensome, MacRae, &amp; Williams, 2008), in \n\nparticular the Glossary section, based on Fensome, Taylor, Norris, Sarjeant, Wharton, \n\nand Williams (1993), was also used as a regular source for short definitions.\n\n4.2. DEFINING FEATURES\n\n4.2.1. Flagella\n\nThe defining trait of dinoflagellates is the presence, at some stage of their life cycle, of \n\ntwo dissimilar flagella typically emerging out of a flagellar pore in the conventionally \n\ntermed ventral surface of the cell (see Fig. 9). These flagella allow for position stability \n\nand motility in the aquatic environment. A ribbon-like transverse flagellum lying in \n\nthe cingulum, an equatorial furrow all around the cell, provides simultaneous forward \n\nand rotating propulsion through undulation from base to tip at the outer edge. A \n\nmore conventional longitudinal flagellum, projecting outwards from a medium \n\ngroove termed sulcus, beats posteriorly and allows for translational motion (Gaines &amp; \n\nTaylor, 1985). \n\nThe type of flagella insertion just described is predominant and known as \n\ndinokont flagellation. A number of dinoflagellate genus, such as the Prorocentrum, \n\npresent what has been termed desmokont flagellation: flagella are still similarly \n\ndifferentiated, but they do not lie in grooves and are anterior relative to motion \n\n(Fensome et al., 1999; Hoppenrath &amp; Saldarriaga, 2012). In both cases, flagella and/or \n\ntheir associated structures provide a natural orientation to the cells. \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Biology and Morphology\n\n41\n\nFigure 9 - Morphology of a typical motile cell, illustrating the two dissimilar flagella and the axes defining \nthe cell natural orientation: apex-antapex and ventral and dorsal surfaces (adapted from Fensome, Riding, \nand Taylor, 1996).\n\nThe cingulum (transverse groove) divides the cell in an upper and a lower part, \n\ngenerally designated as episome and hyposome, respectively. The highest point of the \n\nepisome is called the apex, and lies at the front of the movement when the cell is \n\nswimming. The bottom of the hyposome is called the antapex. The upper and lower \n\nparts of the motile cell are for that reason also designated, respectively, as apical or \n\nanterior and antapical or posterior. The sulcus (longitudinal groove) conventionally \n\ndefines a ventral surface of the cell, and thus also an opposite dorsal surface. For each \n\nsurface, ventral and dorsal, right and left lateral sides can then be distinguished using \n\nthe sulcus as a middle reference. Understanding of the cell orientation is essential both \n\nin describing a particular dinoflagellates species and in meaningfully interpreting \n\ndescriptions made available in the literature.\n\n4.2.2. Dinokaryon\n\nA second typical feature of most, though not all, dinoflagellates is the possession of \n\na nuclear state known as dinokaryon (Fensome et al., 1999). While both molecular \n\nphylogenetic and ultrastructural information establish dinoflagellates as eukariots, \n\ntypically included in the Protist reign (division Dinoflagellata), dinokaryons (which \n\ndetermine the subdvision Dinokaryota) depart from conventional eukaryote nuclei \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n42\n\nin several regards. They lack histones and nucleosomes, presenting a much lower ratio \n\nof proteins to DNA than other eukaryotes (Rizzo, 1991). Rather than decondensing \n\nduring the interphase, chromosomes remain visible all along the mitotic cycle \n\n(Spector, Vasconcelos, &amp; Triemer, 1981). Mitosis is also atypical, being dubbed as \n\ndinomitosis: the nucleus membrane is not ruptured during mitosis, which is thus \n\n\u201cclosed\u201d, and the mitotic spindle is extranuclear, not linked to the centrioles (Dodge \n\n&amp; Greuet, 1987). Dinoflagellates without a dinokaryon are classified as Syndiniales \n\n(subdivision Syndinia).\n\n4.2.3. Other dinoflagellate ultrastructures\n\nAs other eukaryotes, dinoflagellate cells contain in their cytoplasm different types \n\nof organelles, including mitochondria, vacuoles and pusules (a special kind of \n\nvacuoles opening up at the cellular bases), Golgi complex, pyrenoids and plastids \n\n(in photosynthetic and mixotrophic species, which are the vast majority: Schnepf \n\n&amp; Elbr\u00e4chter, 1992), besides microbodies and storage products. The most common \n\nsort of plastides are peridin plastides, and photosynthetic pigments include peridin, \n\nchlorophylls a and c\n2\n, b-carotene and small quantities of diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin \n\n(Jeffrey, Sielicki, &amp; Haxo, 1975; Sousa et al., 1999). Heterotrophic dinoflagellates do \n\nnot present chloroplasts and may exhibit a variety of feeding stuctures, dependent \n\non the particular form of feeding (e.g., direct phagocytosis, myzocytosis, or pallium \n\nfeeding), such as cytostomes, peduncules or pallia (Jacobson and Anderson, 1992; \n\nHackett, Anderson, Erdner, &amp; Bhattacharya, 2004).\n\nEspecially important for the issue of dinoflagellates classification is the organization \n\nof the outer region of dinoflagellate cells, designated as cortex (Netzel &amp; D\u00fcrr, 1984) \n\nor amphiesma (Morril &amp; Loeblich III, 1983). The amphiesma is a complex structure \n\ncomposed of several membranes: underneath the plasmalemma, a membrane that \n\ncoats the entire motile dinoflagellate cell, it typically includes a single layer of flat \n\nvesicles called alveolae or amphiesmal vesicles, which play a structural role. In many \n\ncases, these vesicles comprise tightly fit cellulosic plates (one per vesicle), which \n\nprovide an external armor to the cell, known as theca. In other cases, the vesicles are \n\neither empty or filled with amorphous material. Dinoflagellates with thecal plates are \n\nthus known as armoured or techate and those without cellulosic plates as athecate. \n\nCell protection is ensured in athecate dinoflagellates by a flexible protein coating, \n\nand some species may present an internal calcareous (or less often siliceous) skeleton \n\n(Morril &amp; Loeblich III, 1983; Sousa et al., 1999). \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Biology and Morphology\n\n43\n\nFigure 10 - External morphology of an athecate and thecate motile cells: variations in the designation of \nanterior and posterior regions of the cell according to its thechate or athecate character are illustrated (after \nHoppenrath, 2008, in Hoppenrath and Saldarriaga, 2012; changed to gray scale).\n\nIn some species a thin fibrous membrane, designated as dino-pellicle, chiefly \n\nmade of cellulose and combined in varying degree with dinosporin, occurs under \n\nthe alveolae. This pellicle can be the main strenghtening layer of the amphiesma in \n\nsome athecate dinoflagellates, which are then referred to as pelliculate dinoflagelates \n\n(Morril &amp; Loeblich III, 1983). When present in thecate varieties, the pellicle lies \n\nunder the theca and forms the wall of organic-walled cysts prone to fossilize. The \n\nmore specific designations of the episome (apical part) and hyposome (antapical part) \n\nof the motile cell defined by the cingulum vary according to the naked or armoured \n\ncharacter of the dinoflagellate (see Fig. 10).\n\nThe episome can be termed epicone or epitract in atechate cells and epitheca in \n\ntechate ones (or yet epicyst in dinocysts). The hyposome may be called hypoconone \n\nor hypotract in atechate varieties an hypotheca in techate ones (or yet hypocyst in \n\ndinocysts). Atechate cells may present a groove at the apex, known as acrobase, and \n\ntechate cells a pore at the top of the apical horn (apical pore). \n\nThe thecal plates form closely imbricated patterns, with sutures at their \n\nboundaries. These sutures grant flexibility and make possible for the cell to grow by \n\nadding wall material at the margins of the thecal plates. The arrangements of alveoles \n\nand thecal plates, known as tabulation, remain to this day the most information-\n\nrich morphological dataset for the classification (taxonomy) of dinoflagellates motile \n\nstages Tabulation has long been shown to be highly conservative in each species \n\n(Fensome et al., 1999). \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n44\n\n4.3. TABULATION IN DINOFLAGELLATES\n\nSix main systems of tabulation have been distinguished in dinoflagellates (Fensome \n\net al., 1993), respectively: Gymnodinoid, Suessioid, Gonyaulacoid-Peridinioid, \n\nNannoceratopsioid, Dynophisioid and Prorocentroid. A brief characterization is \n\ngiven in the following of each of these systems (see Fig. 11):\n\nGymnodinoid tabulation: amphiesmal vesicles are numerous, often hexagonally-\n\nshaped, typically without theca plates, and either randomly organized or arranged in \n\nmore than ten latitudinal series. \n\nSuessioid tabulation: vesicles typically include delicate thecal plates (polygonal and \n\nof similar size) and are organized in an array of five to ten latitudinal series, with most \n\noften a not clearly differentiated cingulum.\n\nFigure 11 - Schematic illustration of tabulation types (after Fensome et al., 1999, modified from Fensome \net al., 1993).\n\nGonyaulacoid-Peridinioid tabulation: amphiesmal vesicles contain true thecal \n\nplates and are arranged in five or six primary latitudinal series and one longitudinal \n\nseries, with a marked cingulum. Considered from the apex to the antapex poles, \n\nthe techal plates are classified as apicals (those contacting the apical pore complex), \n\nprecingulars (immediately preceding the cingulum), cingulars (located on the \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Biology and Morphology\n\n45\n\ncingulum), postcingulars (immediately following the cingulum) and antapicals (lying \n\non the antapex), with those lying in between these series termed intermediaries and \n\nthose located within the sulcus as sulcals. As a difference between gonyaulocoid and \n\nperidionoid tabulations, the former is associated with a symmetrical first apical plate \n\nand the occurrence of two antapical plates, while the latter involves an asymmetrical \n\nfirst apical plate and two to four fundital plates (posterior to the first postcingular \n\nseries and external to the sulcus).\n\nDinophysioid tabulation: the vesicles are arranged in four latitudinal series, with a \n\nclear cingulum and a saggital sulcus that splits the theca in two well-defined right and \n\nleft halves. A simple apical pore occurs on the ventral surface of the epitheca. \n\nNannoceratopsioid tabulation: corresponds to a hybrid of the two preceding \n\ntabulations, combining a hyposoma which is dinophyisioid and an episoma which is \n\ngonyaulacoid-peridinioid. \n\nProrocentroid: the teca comprises two large plates, named valves, separated by \n\na saggital suture, without distinguishable cingulum or sulcus. Flagella are apically \n\ninserted (desmokont flagellation) on one of two apical pores, surrounded by small \n\nplates lying mainly on an excavation of the right valve.\n\nThese tabulation systems are of critical importance not just to the taxonomy of \n\nliving dinoflagellates as to the taxonomy of fossil species, to the extent that the surface \n\nof fossil cysts reflects the cortical organization of the motile cell. As this happens to \n\na varying degree, and cyst-specific structures without a thecal equivalent (coined \n\nas cystomorphic structures by Gocht, 1983) can also occur, tabulation applied to \n\nfossils has been more specifically referred to as paratabulation. However, in its broad \n\nsense, the term tabulation conveniently encompasses the taxonomy of both living \n\nand fossile material (Fensome et al., 1999). This issue will be more directly dealt with \n\nin the section devoted to the morphology of dynocysts.\n\n4.4. DINOFLAGELLATES LIFECYCLE\n\nWith few exceptions, dinoflagellates present haplobiontic lifecycles (Fensome, Taylor, \n\nNorris, Sarjeant, Wharton, &amp; Williams, 1993). Population growth is mostly obtained \n\ntrough asexual reproduction via binary division of biflagellate haploid motile cells \n\n(vegetative stage). Although it has only been observed on a small percentage of \n\nspecies (around 1%), sexual reproduction also occurs under given environmental \n\nconditions, calling for an increase in genetic variability. Gametes (either isogametes \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n46\n\nor anisogametes) are then formed, similar to the regular haploid motile cells, which \n\nfuse to produce a diploid zygote motile cell, known as planozygote. Depending \n\nagain on the environment, the planozygote can directly undergo meiosis, restoring \n\nthe vegetative haploid stage of the life cycle, or can shift first into a dormant stage, \n\nthe hypnozygote, before meiosis takes place after a variable period, controlled by \n\nsurrounding conditions which trigger excystment (see Fig. 12). \n\nFigure 12 - Dinoflagellates life cycle (after Figueiroa &amp; Garc\u00e9s, 2010, modified from Walker, 1984; changed \nto gray scaled).\n\nThis hypnozygote, also known as a resting cyst or dynocyst, is non-motile (it has \n\nno flagella) and is environmentally resistant through the building of a continuous \n\nthick wall below the theca. It naturally sinks into the sediments, behaving like a \n\nsedimentary particle. Another type of cysts, variedly known as pellicle, temporary, or \n\necdysal cysts, presents instead a thin wall which lasts only for a short period, and, just \n\nas the wall of vegetative (metabolic active) cysts, are easily destroyed by bacteria after \n\ndeath of the organism. By contrast, resistance cysts present organic walls typically \n\nmade of dinosporine, a highly resistant material akin to sporopollenin, or sometimes \n\ninorganic, calcareous or (more rarely) siliceous walls, which all enable fossilization \n\nafter the organism\u2019s death. Most fossil dinoflagellates are thus believed to correspond \n\nto fossilized resistance dinocysts.\n\nIt has been estimated that only 15-20 % of living dinoflaglellates produce cysts \n\nwhich are prone to fossilization. As noted in Fensome et al. (1999), this may appear \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Biology and Morphology\n\n47\n\nat first sight to strongly limit the usefulness of microfossil records for highlighting \n\ndinoflagellate evolution. However, only a few number of dinoflagellate lineages \n\nare actually represented in the fossil record, mainly of the Gonyaulacoid-Perinioid \n\nsystem, so that the representation for these particular lineages is quite above the 15-\n\n20% overall threshold (Fensome et al., 1999, p. 69). Critical to the biostratigraphic \n\nimportance of fossil dinocysts is the way they reflect or not the external shape, \n\nparticularly the tabulation, of the living motile cell. This depends on how the cyst \n\nwall is formed and opens way to the morphological classification of cysts. \n\n4.5. DINOCYSTS MORPHOLOGY\n\nA resistant cyst may be formed either through building a continuous wall immediately \n\nwithin the theca (thus with a similar shape to the theca) or only after the contraction \n\nof the cell into a spherical body with projections (processes or crests), in which case \n\nthe shape of the wall may significantly depart from the shape of the mother cell. \n\nCysts of the former type are known as proximate and typically present no external \n\nprojections. Cysts of the latter type are termed chorate or proximochorate, depending \n\non the ratio of the length of the external projections to the shorter diameter of the \n\ncentral body (Sargeant, 1982). The length of these projections is in between ten and \n\nthirty percent of the central body diameter in proxichomorate and in excess of thirty \n\npercent in chorate cysts. \n\nAmong the chief morphological features of the cysts are the cyst wall, which \n\ncan present different degrees of complexity, the surface ornamentation (relief or \n\nprojections), the archeopyle (corresponding to the excystment aperture), and the \n\ntabulation or paratabulation system.\n\n4.5.1. Cyst wall\n\nDinocysts may have a single-layered wall enclosing a single cavity, in which case \n\nthey are called autocysts, the wall being then termed autophragm and the enclosed \n\ncavity the autocoel. These dinocysts are also referred to as acavate and are often, \n\nthough not exclusively, of the proximate type, reflecting the overall shape of the \n\nmother cell. Morphologically more complex dinocysts may in turn present a wall \n\nwith several layers and enclosed cavities. When there are two layers, the inner one is \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n48\n\ncalled endophragm and the outer one periphragm, with the innermost cavity named \n\nthe endocoel and the cavity encircled by the two layers named the pericoel. When \n\nthree layers occur, the one external to the periphragm is termed the ectophragm \n\n(typically structurally linked to the underlying layer via processes or other supporting \n\nformations) and the cavity between it and the periphragm is known as the ectocoel. \n\nAnother kind of three-layered wall sometimes occurs, as in some peridinioid fossils, \n\nexhibiting an independent thin layer lying in between the periphragm and the \n\nendophragm. This layer, which is not structurally supported by any other, is known \n\nas the mesophragm and encircles a cavity termed the mesocoel. All cysts with \n\nmultiple layers and cavities are known as cavate (Evitt et al., 1977; De vertuil &amp; \n\nNorris, 1966; Sousa et al., 1999). Different types of cavate cysts can be distinguished, \n\nwhich constitute important morhological information (morphotypes) for species \n\nidentification and dinocysts taxonomy. These include the holocavate, circumcavate, \n\nbicavate, cornucavate, suturocavate and camocavate forms, which differ concerning \n\nthe form and distribution of the cavities in the cyst (Evitt, 1985). Procedures have \n\nbeen outlined for identifying the wall layers, largely based on the presence of regular \n\nprocesses and septa (Evitt et al., 1977) which will be briefly addressed in the following \n\nsubsection. \n\n4.5.2. Surface relief\n\nThe surface of dinocysts may be smooth or exhibit some relief, such as the patterns \n\nof parasutural lines (Evitt et al., 1977) reflecting the arrangement of theca plates \n\n(thecamorphic structures), or cystomorphic structures such as processes (columnar \n\nformations arising from a specific point on an external structure), spines (acuminate \n\nprocesses) and septa (delicate linear projections which form circles or crests on the \n\nwall). These relief structures are highly variable in shape and distribution over the \n\ncyst (e.g., from random to parasutural to intratabular) (see Evitt et al., 1977; Evitt, \n\n1985; Zonneveld &amp; Pospelova, 2015). In many cysts, the relief patterns, namely the \n\nprocesses and septa, reflect in total or in part the tabulation system of the original \n\ncell, which turns them into a core morphological element for the dinoflagellate-\n\ncyst association (Fensome et al., 1993). They are commonly highly regular structures, \n\nvirtually constant across individuals in a given species. However, they may sometimes \n\nhappen to be irregular, varying from specimen to specimen within a species, in \n\nwhich case they become mere incidental features. Besides their value for species \n\nidentification, they may also, less contentiously than overall cyst shape, be the carriers \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Biology and Morphology\n\n49\n\nof important palaeoenvironmental information. For instance, a relation between \n\nshorter processes and growth in lower salinity environments has been consistently \n\ndocumented (Dale, 1996).\n\n4.5.3. Archeopyle\n\nThe archeopyle is an important morphological feature of dinocysts. It corresponds \n\nto the opening through which excystment takes place (Evitt et al., 1977; Fensome et \n\nal., 1993). Commonly, it is outlined by an archeopyle suture, visible at the microscope \n\nand believed to be formed at the time the cyst wall develops, but it may also result \n\nfrom the detachment of plates not delineated by a preexisting suture. The archeopyle \n\nsuture typically runs along the boundaries of one or more paraplates (parasutures), \n\ndefining this way a section of the cyst paratabulation. The opening left by the rupture \n\nof the wall along the archeopyle suture (or by plate detachment without a pre-\n\ndetermined suture) is termed the archeopyle operculum. Opercula comprising one \n\nsingle paraplate are termed monoplacoid and those comprising several paraplates \n\npolyplacoid. When the operculum is completely encircled by the archeopyle suture, \n\nbeing thus entirely detachable from the cyst wall, it is said to be free (even if it may \n\nby accident be adherent to the wall at a point where the suture happened not to \n\nopen). When the suture does not fully surround the operculum, which thus remains \n\npartly attached to the cyst, the operculum is known as adnate. Just as its shape and \n\nsize, location of the archeopyle on the cyst may be highly variable, ranging from \n\napical to intercalary and precingular, and even to postcingular and antapical, as is the \n\ncase with siliceous cysts of Peridinites. Polyplacoid opercula may include paraplates \n\nbelonging to one single series of paraplates, in which case they are simple, or to two \n\nor more series, in which case they are said to be compound. A particular case of a \n\ncompound archeopyle is known as epicystal archeopyle (after Evitt et al., 1977), who \n\ndeem this designation preferable to the one of epitractal archeopyle), comprising \n\nall paraplates of the epicyst. Although the archeopyle morphology may be highly \n\nspecific in some dinoflaggellate species, as noticed in Evitt et al., 1977, it only provides \n\ndirect indications about a small fraction (usually restricted to very few plates) of the \n\ntabulation.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n50\n\n4.5.4. Paratabulation\n\nParatabulation is by far the most important morphological classificatory feature of \n\ndinocysts. It designates the ensemble of characteristics of the apparent plates on the \n\ncyst, including their shape, number, size and mutual relationship (Evitt et al., 1977). As \n\nmentioned previously, tabulation is currently used to encompass both the tabulation \n\nof living motile cells and of fossil cysts, the same main six tabulation systems described \n\nabove (section \u201ctabulation in Dinoflagellates) being also used for the classification of \n\npatterns of plates in dinocysts. However, the expression paratabulation signals the \n\ncircumstance that tabulation of the cyst will typically offer an incomplete view of \n\nthe theca tabulation, the link between the two being thus inferential to some extent. \n\nNotwithstanding, just as tabulation for living motile cells, paratabulation has proven \n\ninvaluable for the taxonomy of fossil dinocysts. \n\nOne important methodological aspect of tabulation has been the development \n\nof notational codes to describe it, known as tabulation formulae (or paratabulation \n\nformulae, when applied to paraplates). A popular tabulation formula was put \n\nforward by Kofoid as early as 1907/1909 and is still in use today in modified \n\nversions (Fensome et al., 1993). Plates in each latitudinal series (apical, precingular, \n\npostcingular, antapical), indexed by specific symbols, are numbered from left to right \n\nstarting from the midventral position and parallel to the transverse flagellum. While \n\nthe tabulation formula for a theca includes the total number of thecal plates, the \n\nparatabulation formula for a cyst only expresses the number of observable plates and \n\ntheir disposition. As a consequence, the two formulae will only coincide when the \n\nthecal morphology happens to be fully expressed in the cyst morphology (see Evitt \n\net al., 1977). Tabulation and paratabulation formulae deal with only a selected portion \n\nof the information conveyed by the tabulation (paratabulation), as they concern the \n\nnumber and arrangement of plates with no consideration for their size, shape and \n\nmutual relationships. Useful as they are, they cannot thus be thought of as exhausting \n\nthe morphological information of dinoflagellates or dinocysts tabulations.\n\nOne often useful complement to address cysts paratabulation is provided by the \n\npattern of processes (see subsection \u201csurface relief \u201d above), whenever they happen to \n\nreflect thecal morphology (e.g., when arranged along the parasutural lines, or presenting \n\nan intratabular distribution). Formulae for processes have also been developed, which \n\nmay or not coincide with the paratabulation formula (Stover, 1975).\n\n\n\n51\n\n5.1. TAXONOMY\n\nAn acceptable classification of dinoflagellates should be able to encompass both present \n\nand fossil forms and moreover reflect dinoflagellates phylogeny. Fensome et al. (1993) \n\ndeveloped a phylogenetic tree of dinoflagellates based on ultrastructures, particularly \n\ntabulation, which was subsequently supported in many aspects by molecular studies \n\n(Medlin &amp; Fensome, 2013). While molecular phylogenetic analyses successfully \n\ncontributed to highlight the closest evolutionary relatives of dinoflagellates (e.g, \n\nApicomplexa and Ciliata), they have failed to this day in decoding the internal \n\nrelationships among classical orders of dinoflagellates (G\u00f3mez, 2012; Hacket et al., \n\n2004; Taylor, 2004). Nevertheless, they have supported overall morphologically based \n\nclassifications (Hacket et al., 2004), which thus remain at the centre of taxonomic \n\nefforts.\n\nDespite progress made in the morphological characterization of dinoflagellates \n\nsince the first attempts of a comprehensive taxonomy (Bujak &amp; Williams, 1981; Taylor, \n\n2004), several problems remain in the classification of this group, as part of a work \n\nin progress, particularly at the order levels (Gom\u00e9z, 2012). One long acknowledged \n\ndifficulty arises from the fact that species in a single living genus do not necessarily \n\npresent uniform morphocysts, or that the cysts of two distinct species may be much \n\nmore distinct than their theca armour (Sargeant, 1974). Nomenclature issues have \n\nalso always been around, starting with the treatment of dinoflagellates by different \n\nauthors under either the international zoological or the botanical nomenclature \n\nDINOFLAGELLATES TAXONOMY, \nSTRATIGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION  \n\nAND PALAEOECOLOGY\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n52\n\ncodes (respectively, I.Z.C.N and I.B.C.N: Gom\u00e9z, 2012). It is now widely accepted \n\nthat the ICN, abbreviation for International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and \n\nplants (McNeill et al., 2012) should be used for the classification of living Dinokaryota \n\nand of known fossil dinoflagellates (all in the Dinokaryota Subdivision) (Williams &amp; \n\nFensome, 2016). \n\nIn spite of that, evolutions of the code itself and the need to account for new \n\nfossil taxa and nomenclatural changes proposed in a fast growing literature have \n\nrequired the regular revision and updating of major classification systems. In the case \n\nof fossil dinoflagellates, the first systematic attempt at an inclusive index of genera \n\nand species (the Lentin and Williams Index: Lentin &amp; Williams, 1973) has accordingly \n\nundergone numerous revisions (Lentin &amp; Williams, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1985, 1989, \n\n1993; Williams, Lentin, &amp; Fensome., 1998; Fensome &amp; Williams, 2004; Williams &amp; \n\nFensome, 2016). Some of these revisions were given a digital form and made generally \n\navailable online, leading to DINOFLAJ2 (Fensome, MacRae, &amp; Williams, 2008), \n\nwhich superseded the earlier DINOFLAJ database (Fensome, MacRae, &amp; Williams, \n\n1998) and incorporates the nomenclature and taxonomy of the 2004 edition of the \n\nLentin and Williams Index. A major update of DINOFLAJ2 is in preparation for \n\nrelease during 2016 (DINOFLAJ3, upcoming: Fensome &amp; Williams 2016). \n\nBesides an index of fossil dinoflagellates at the levels of genera, species and \n\nsubspecies (after Williams &amp; Fensome, 2004), DINOFLAJ2 includes a joint classification \n\nof fossil and living dinoflagellates from the level of divison (Dinoflagellates) down \n\nto genera (based on Fensome et al. 1993), where it becomes continuous with the \n\nindex information. The general taxonomy presented below is based on Fensome \n\net al. (1993) (see also Sousa et al., 1999), and reproduced with adaptations from \n\nDINOFLAJ2 (see Table 1).\n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n53\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Classification of dinoflagellates within the Kingdom Protist down to the \n\nsuborder rank (reproduced with adaptations from DINOFLAJ2).\n\nKingdom Division\nSub \n\ndivision\nClass Subclass Order Suborder\n\nP\nro\n\nti\nst\n\nD\nin\n\no\nfl\nag\n\nel\nla\n\nta\n\nD\nin\n\no\nka\n\nry\no\nta\n\nD\nin\n\no\nph\n\nyc\nea\n\ne\nGymnodiniphycidae\n\nG\nym\n\nn\no\ndi\n\nn\nia\n\nle\ns\n\nGymnodiniineae\n\nActiniscineae\n\nPtychodiscales\n\nSuessiales\n\nPeridiniphycidae\n\nG\no\nny\n\nau\nla\n\nca\nle\n\ns\n\nRhaetogonyaulacineae\n\nCladopyxiineae\n\nGoniodomineae\n\nGonyaulacineae\n\nCeratiineae\n\nUncertain\n\nP\ner\n\nid\nin\n\nia\nle\n\ns\n\nHeterocapsineae\n\nPeridiniineae\n\nGlenodiniineae\n\nUncertain\n\nUncertain\n\nDinophysiphycidae\nNannoceratopsiales\n\nDinophysiales\n\nProrocentrophycidae Prorocentrales\n\nUncertain\n\nDesmocapsales\n\nPhytodiniales\n\nThoracosphaerales\n\nUncertain\n\nBlastodiniphyceae Blastodiniales\n\nNoctiluciphyceae Noctilucales\n\nUncertain Uncertain\n\nSyndinea Syndiniophyceae Syndiniales\n\nUncertain \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n54\n\nFigure 13 - Number of known dinoflagellate fossil species per family and per time interval (Mezosoic stages \nand epochs) represented as spindle plots. The light-transparent blue rectangle corresponds to the Lower and \nMidlle Cenomanian time interval (adapted from Fensome et al., 1999).\n\nTaxonomically, dinoflagellates constitute a division (Dinoflagellates) of the \n\nKingdom Protist, comprising three subdivisions, of which one is uncertain. The \n\nremaining two are the Dinokaryota (dinoflagellates presenting a dinokaryon in \n\nat least one stage of their life-cycle) and the Syndiniae (dinoflagellates presenting \n\ndinokont flagellation and histones in the nucleous). While Syndiniae have a single \n\nclass (Syndiniophyceae), Dinokaryota comprise four classes, one of them uncertain \n\nand, under the class Dinophyceae, five subclasses, with one uncertain (Table 1). \n\nAll known fossil dinoflagellates belong to the Dinokaryota subdivision. The Class \n\nDinophyceae encompasses the six basic tabulation/paratabulation types described \n\nin the preceding chapter (gymnodinoid, suessioid, gonyaulacoid-peridinioid, \n\ndinophysoid, nannoceratopsioid and prorocentroid: Fensome et al., 1993; Talyor, \n\n1987), which provide the morphological basis for the distinction of subordinated \n\nmain orders. These tabulation systems have distinct representations among extant and \n\nfossil forms. \n\nThe gonyaulacoid-peridinioid system, exemplified by a majority of fossil \n\ndinoflagellates (from the Jurassic onwards) is also commonly represented in motile \n\ndinoflagellate cells (Fensome et al., 1999). Nannoceratopsioid tabulations are exclusive \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n55\n\nof the fossil record (Jurassic). Prorocentroid tabulation is only found in living forms, \n\nwhich, to the exception of two questionable Jurassic fossil genera (Nannoceratopsis \n\nand Ternia,), might also be said of the dinophysoid tabulation. The gymnodinioid \n\nand suessioid systems have a sporadic fossil representation and have both extant \n\nrepresentatives. Fig. 13 relates the classification of dinoflagellates to geochronologic \n\nunits (Mesozoic stages and epochs) by plotting the time of appearance of different \n\ntaxonomic subclasses and orders and the number of species per family obtained in \n\nthe fossil record. The time interval delimited by the two horizontal dashed lines in \n\nthe Cretaceous corresponds to the lower and upper boundaries of the Cenomanian \n\nStage, which is the stratigraphic interval focused in the present work.\n\nA more detailed account, at the level of relevant genera and species, of the \n\nrelation between fossil dinoflagellates taxonomy and main stratigraphic intervals, will \n\nbe given in the section devoted to dinocyst biostratigraphy.\n\n5.2. DINOCYST BIOSTRATIGRAPHY\n\n5.2.1. Relation to main geochronological units\n\nDespite biogeochemical evidence for a pre-Mesozoic occurrence of dinoglagellates, \n\nwith ancestors possibly dating back to the Cambrian period (Moldowan &amp; Talyzina, \n\n1998), the earliest confirmed dinocysts were found in Middle-Late Triassic sediments, \n\n240-200 Ma (Macrae, Fensome, &amp; Williams, 1996; Medlin &amp; Fensome, 2013). From \n\nthen on, cyst-forming dinoflagellates are abundantly documented in the fossil record \n\nof marine Mesozoic-Cenozoic sediments, exhibiting noticeable species diversity \n\n(circa 2500 species: Taylor et al., 2008). The pattern of diversity shows a rapid increase \n\nfrom Late Triassic to a maximum in the Cretaceous (local peaks in the Albian and \n\nthe Maastrichian), and a consistent decline all along the Cenozoic, starting in the \n\nEarly Paleocene and with the single exception of a local increase in the Early Eocene \n\n(MacRae et al., 1996: see Fig. 14).\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n56\n\nFigure 14 - Fossil dinoflagellate diversity (number of species) during the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic (until \nthe Quaternary) and its overall correlation with in long-term sea level (after MaCrae et al., 1996).\n\nDespite disagreement as to the precise number of dinocyst species in each \n\nchrono-geologic unit (see Macrae et al., 1996, Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005 and Taylor \n\net al., 2008), the profile of diversity plots is strikingly similar across different studies, \n\nindicating that it reflects natural events, rather than sampling or methodological \n\nartifacts (Macrae et al., 1996). Overall, the cyst-diversity plot correlates well with the \n\nlong-term sea-level curve, with high diversity associated to periods of high sea levels \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n57\n\nand large shelf seas, plausibly manifesting the preference of dinoflagellates for shelf \n\nenvironments (Macrae et al., 1996; Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). The declining trend \n\nfrom the Lower Cenozoic until the present day somewhat parallels the development \n\nof the Earth\u2019s cryosphere (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). \n\nThe rapid radiation of dinocysts from the Late Triassic into the Early Jurassic, \n\ncharacterized by a marked proliferation of morphological types (namely as regards \n\ntabulation) and followed, after the Middle Jurassic, by a relative stabilization of major \n\nlineages, was interpreted as a truly evolutionary event (Fensome et al., 1999), despite \n\nearly concerns over the incompleteness of the fossil record. This interpretation is \n\nstrengthened by the occurrence of sequential appearances of individual families \n\nwith a link provided by intermediate tabulations (e.g., peridinioids appear to have \n\nderived from gonyaulacaleans via a cladopyxiinean ancestor already present in the \n\nEarly Jurassic) (Fensome et al., 1999). Available evidence that core structural features \n\nof the dinoflagellates as we know them today, such as the cingulum and the sulcus, may \n\nhave evolved during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic radiation also points in that same \n\ndirection, having been supported by molecular analyses (Medlin &amp; Fensome, 2013).\n\nThe first morphological (tabulation-based) groups to appear were suessioids and \n\ngonyaulacoids, followed by peridinioids, which underwent a quick expansion in the \n\nCretaceous (Taylor et al., 2008). By the Middle Jurassic, the main gonyaulacoid-\n\nperidinioid lineages (under the subclass Peridiniphycidae) to which most known fossil \n\ndinoflagellates belong were already established. After the mid Jurassic, the appearance \n\nof new groups within the dominant Peridiniphycidae subclass involve only minor \n\nmorphological changes, (e.g., peridiniaceans differ from the earlier heterocapsaeans \n\nby the elimination of one apical plate boundary and the protoperidinaceans derive \n\nfrom peridinaciens via a reduction in the number of apical plates), contrasting with \n\nthe major tabulation innovations that emerged in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic \n\n(Fensome et al., 1999). In general, no new important cyst types appear after the \n\nMezosoic (Taylor et al., 2008). The first freshwater fossil dinocysts, consisting of \n\nspecies of the ceratioid group, appeared in Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) deltaic \n\npounds, having thus a much shorter record than dinocysts in marine facies (Mart\u00edn-\n\nClosas, 2003). Differently from other groups, dinoflagellates do not seem to have been \n\naffected by species extinction at the Cretaceous-Terciary boundary (K/T) (Macrae et \n\nal., 1996), as all major lineages survived to this day (Taylor, 2004). However, regional \n\nevolution and extinctions of species during the late Cenozoic may have occurred, in \n\nconnection to dramatic climatic variations at the onset of continental glaciations, as \n\nsuggested by differences in cyst assemblages in mid-high latitudes of the Northern \n\nand Southern Hemispheres (De Vernal, 2009).\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n58\n\n5.2.2. Dinocyst biozonations\n\nDinoflagellate cysts occur in a wide variety of marine sediments, from shales, clays \n\nand marls to sandstones and limestones (Sargeant, 1974). The circumstance that they \n\ncan be found from inner neritic to pelagic settings makes dinocyst biostratigraphy \n\nparticularly apt for correlations between proximal and distal marine sites (Pross \n\net al., 2010). Relative to calcareous microfossils (e.g., foraminifera, calcareous \n\nnannoplankton), organic-walled cysts present the additional advantage that they do \n\nnot suffer decalcification and are resistant to diagenetic processes as well as to mild \n\nthermal metamorphism (Sargeant, 1974). Relative to macrofossils, the analysis of \n\ndinocysts typically requires smaller amounts of material, remaining applicable to \n\nvery small core samples (Pross, 2001; Sargeant, 1974). Dinoflagellates taxonomy is \n\nalso more highly constrained than that of other palynomorphs, such as acritarchs \n\nand miospores (e.g., angiosperm pollen), thus allowing for more robust approaches \n\n(Fensome, Crux, et al., 2008). Taken together, these characteristics make organic-\n\nwalled fossil dynocists the prime candidates upon which to base a biostratigraphy of \n\nmarine Mesozoic-Cenozoic strata.\n\nPioneer dinocyst-based biostratigraphic studies were largely the work of \n\npalynologists seeking a better understanding of petroleum systems (Williams et al., \n\n2004). An increased recognition of the usefulness of dinocysts ecobiostratigraphy in \n\nhydrocarbon exploration established it as routine tool in the past decades (Pross &amp; \n\nBrinkhuis, 2005). Evidence that higher stratigraphic resolution can be obtained from \n\ndinocysts as compared to any other microfossil group has been reported for several oil \n\nand gas exploration sites at the central North Sea (Gradstein, Kristiansen, Loemo, &amp; \n\nKaminski, 1992). All earlier studies were however limited to local subsurface sections \n\nand did not include independent chronostratigraphic calibrations of dinocyst events \n\n(Williams et al., 2004). Increased efforts towards more extensive studies, allowing \n\nfor the correlation of multiple sections, (including reference surface sections and \n\nstratotypes) and for external chronostratigraphical controls (e.g., biotic calibration \n\nto other fossil groups, such as foraminifers and planktonic nannofossils, or to \n\nmacrofossils, magnetostratigraphy calibration, chemostratigraphic calibration) were \n\nthus developed, leading to the proposal of dinocyst biozonations for comprehensive \n\nregions and time intervals (Williams et al., 2004). \n\nA broad listing of dinocyst zonations for the Cretaceous-Cenozoic of the Northern \n\nHemisphere and the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene of the Southern Hemisphere can \n\nbe found in Williams et al. (2004), who also discuss remaining issues of calibration, \n\nparticularly for the Paleogene in the Southern Ocean, and the problems faced by \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n59\n\nNeogene zonations in higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere due to shortage \n\nof specimens (reflecting the destruction of cysts by oxygen-rich waters and/or the \n\ndisappearance of cyst-producing dinoflagellates from the Antarctic realm during \n\nthe Oligocen). Significant formal calibrated dinocyst zonations were provided, e.g., \n\nfor the Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene and the Quaternary in the East Tasman \n\nPlateau (Brinkhuis, Sengers, Sluijs, Warnaar, &amp; Williams, 2003), the Late Cretaceous \n\nand the Cenozoic of the Scotian Margin (Eastern Canada) (Fensome, Crux et al., \n\n2008), the northern European Turonian (Olde et al., 2015), the upper Albian to lower \n\nMaastrichtian in the Barents Sea (Radmacher, Tyszka, Mangerud, &amp; Pearce, 2014), or \n\nthe Eocene-Oligocen transition in the Southern Ocean (Sluijs et al., 2003). \n\nFigure 15 - (A) Global dinoflagellates cyst events for the lower middle and upper Turonian provided in \nWilliams et al.

By collating the stratigraphic ranges of different taxa, they produced a \n\nsequence of dinocyst events in association with standard timescales for the Mezoic \n\n(Gradstein and Ogg, 1996) and the Cenozoic (Berggren et al., 1995), and extending \n\nfrom the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) to the Zanclean stage in the Neogene. \n\nThe stratigraphic ranges are conveyed through the indication of the First \n\nOcurrence (FO) and Last Ocurrence (LO) for each taxon in mega-annum (Ma) \n\nAcknowledging the marked \u201cprovincialism\u201d (geographical differentiation of dinocyst \n\nassemblages as a function of such factors as latitude/temperature) in the fossil record, \n\nfirst recognized in Mesozoic sediments (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005), Williams et al. \n\n(2004) also add to the FO/LO of each taxon its assignment to high-, middle- or \n\nlower-latitudes in the Northern or Southern Hemispheres.

Dinocyst stratigraphic studies in Portugal (Mesozoic-Cenozoic)\n\nAs the present work specifically concerns a section of the Lusitanian Basin dating \n\nfrom the Lower to Middle Cenomanian, we provide in the following a brief overview \n\nof dinocysts biostratigraphic studies conducted in Portugal (also allowing in, by \n\nconvenience, some references to the Iberian Peninsula), especially those focusing on the \n\nLusitanian Basin. In a stratigraphic study of the Castilian Platform in Northern Spain, \n\nbased on dinoflagellate cysts, Peyrot (2011) reported that, as regards the Cenomian/\n\nTuronian (Upper Cretaceous) in the Iberian Peninsula, only one Portuguese \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n61\n\nsuccession had been examined by Berthou, Foucher, Lecocq, and Moron (1980). In \n\nfact, at least one more study by Berthou and collaborators was concerned with Albian \n\n(Lower Cretaceous) and Cenomanian (Upper Creaceous) dinocysts in different \n\noutcrops of the Lusitanian Basin (Lisbon Region) with a prime biostratigraphical \n\nfocus (Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler, 1982). A few significant biostratigraphical analyses \n\nbased on dinoflagellate cysts have addressed Lower Cretaceous sections (Berriasian \n\nto Albian) in both the Lusitanian and the Algarve Basins: Berthou and Leereveld \n\n(1990); Heimhofer, Hochuli Burla, and Weissert (2007), Horikx, Heimhofer, Dinis, \n\nand Huck (2014). This latter study revised the stratigraphy of Albian strata in three \n\nsections of the Lusitanian Basin based on dinocyst assemblages with an independent \n\nchemostratigraphic calibration (strontium-isotope and carbon-isotope stratigraphy), \n\nallowing for a high-resolution and well-constrained stratigraphical model. \n\nMost palynological studies allowing a room for the examination of dynocyst \n\nassemblages in Portuguese successions concern the Jurassic (more frequently Lower \n\nand Middle), e.g.: Barr\u00f3n, Comas-Rengifo, and Duarte (2013) and Oliveira, Dino, \n\nDuarte, and Perilli (2007) focusing a Lower Jurassic section (Pliensbachian/Toarcian) \n\nof the Lusitanian Basin; Borges, Riding, Fernandes, and Pereira (2011) and Borges, \n\nRiding, Fernandes, Matos, and Pereira (2012), respectively addressing Pliensbachian \n\nto Kimmeridgian (mid-Lower to mid-Upper Jurassic) and Callovian (Middle Jurassic) \n\nstages in the Algarve Basin; Davies (1985), focusing the Sinemurian to Aalian interval \n\n(Lower to Middle Jurassic) in the central Lusitanian Basin; Doubinger, Adloff, and \n\nPalain (1970), affording a biostratigraphical analysis of the Lower Portuguese Mesozoic \n\n(Early Jurassic, reaching down to Late Triassic); Fernandes, Borges, Rodrigues, and \n\nMatos (2010), examining the Middle-Upper Jurassic (Callovian and Oxfordian stages) \n\nof the Algarve Basin at two offshore sites; Marques and Rocha (1988), addressing the \n\nCallovian of Eastern Algarve; Sousa (1998), focusing on the Oxfordian-Tithonian \n\n(Upper Jurassic) of the Lusitanian Basin. A few studies can also be found concerning \n\nthe Cenozoic, e.g.: Castro (2010), focusing on the Tortonian (Late Miocene) deposits of \n\nthe Lower Tagus basin; Castro, Borges, Pereira, Fernandes, and Pais (2013), addressing \n\nthe biostratigraphical correlation between the Lower Tagus and the Algarve Basins on \n\nthe basis of Miocene (Neogene) dinocysts assemblages; Gon\u00e7alves, Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \n\nda Silva, Mendon\u00e7a, and Flores (2014), covering the palynological content (dynocists \n\nincluded) of a set of stratigraphic units ranging from Middle Jurassic to the Neogene \n\nin the Lower Tagus basin.\n\nThe degree to which dinoflagellate cysts were used with a proper biostratigraphic \n\nview in this array of studies is rather variable (exception made to the Cretaceous subset \n\nof studies, where this is invariably a primary focus), going from merely recognizing \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n62\n\ntheir occurrence in the samples (e.g., Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2014), to according them a \n\nsupplementary role as regards other palynomorphs (notably spores and pollens), to \n\nusing them as major biostratigraphical constraints (with or without additional age \n\ncontrols). Stratigraphic ranges delimited by First and Last Occurrences (FO and FA) \n\nor First Common and Last Common Ocurrences (FCO and LCO) of dinocyst taxa \n\nare offered in some studies, but not in many others. As regards the Upper Cretaceous, \n\nin particular the Cenomanian, Berthou et al. (1980) and Berthou and Hasenboehler \n\n(1982) emerge as the only available studies to the best of our knowledge, confirming \n\nthe scarcity of dinocyst-calibrated stratigraphic models for the Portuguese successions \n\ncorresponding to this geochronological span.\n\n5.3 ECOLOGY AND PALAEOCOLOGY\n\nDinoflagellates are a highly diverse eukaryotic group which can be found in virtually \n\nany aquatic environment, from marine (around 90% of living species) to fresh \n\nwater, predominantly in pelagic habitats, but also sometimes in sand (psammophylic \n\ndinoflagellates), ice or snow (Marret &amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Taylor et al., 2008). Forming \n\na significant part of the phytoplankton, they are important as primary producers. \n\nWhile most of the over 2000 inventoried extant species are free-living, a small \n\npercentage are endosymbionts (e.g., the zooxanthellae, associated with reef-forming \n\ncorals) or parasites of other protists and animals (Taylor et al., 2008). \n\nSeveral characteristics of dinoflagellates favor their occurrence in a wide array of \n\nenvironments, noticeably among them (1) ability for directional swimming (as motile \n\ncells) and (2) diversity of trophic strategies (Hacket et al. 2004). In contrast to diatoms \n\n(see Smayda, 2002), controlled swimming allows dinoflagellates to position at distinct \n\ndepths in the water column (vertical migrations) as a function of parameters such \n\nas, e.g., nutrients concentration, light intensity, salinity, sea surface temperature or \n\noxygen availability. Differential sensitivity to these parameters has moreover been \n\nfound across individual species (Anderson &amp; Stolzenbach, 1985; Hacket et al., 2004). \n\nAs for nutrition, about half of dinoflagellates taxa are photo-synthetic and the \n\nother half heterotrophic, predating to a large extent on other protists, particularly \n\ndiatoms. Most photosynthetic dinoflagellates are not actually autotrophic but \n\nmixotrophic, combining photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Capture and feeding \n\nbehavior among heterotrophs can be highly variable, ranging from phagotrophy (non \n\nthecate cells that engulf their preys) to myzocytosis or pallium-feeding (Hoppenrath \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n63\n\n&amp; Saldarriaga, 2012; Jacobson &amp; Anderson, 1986). Taken together, these ecologically \n\nrelevant characteristics have allowed dinoflagellates as a group to globally exploit \n\ncoastal waters, while at the same time exhibiting considerable habitat specialization at \n\nthe level of individual species (Hackett et al., 2004; Smayda, 2002; Taylor, 1987; Wall, \n\nDale, Lohmann, &amp; Smith, 1977).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some proportion (around 10 to 20 %) of dinoflagellates \n\nproduce dormant resistant cysts, mostly organic-walled (made of dinosporin, which \n\nresists decalcification), as part of their life-cycle. These cysts deposit on the bottom \n\nsediments, where they form seed banks available for the renewal of motile forms \n\nand become additionally prone to fossilization (Sargeant, 1974; Taylor et al., 2008). \n\nThe potential of the geographical distribution of dinocysts in the sediments for \n\nreconstructing salient environmental and climatic features of the upper water surfaces \n\nhas been successfully demonstrated for neritic (e.g., estuaries, epicontinental seas, \n\ncontinental shelves) and pelagic settings (e.g., Marret &amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Pross &amp; \n\nBrinkhuis, 2005; Wall et al., 1977), despite a number of acknowledged limitations \n\n(Dale, 1996; de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007; Wall et al., 1977). \n\nAs reliably identified fossil organic-walled dinocysts are available from the Triassic \n\nonward, the prospect of reconstructing past environments and climates based on cysts \n\ndistribution in ancient sediments was also opened thereby (Marret &amp; Zonneveld, \n\n2003; Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). However, the palaeoecology of fossil cysts requires, \n\nas a precondition, detailed information on the relationships between present day \n\nenvironmental conditions and the distribution of modern cysts in recent sediments \n\n(Zonneveld et al., 2013).\n\n5.3.1. The ecological classification of organic-walled dinocysts: ground \n\nconcepts\n\nThe geographical distribution of modern dinocysts was initially the subject of separate \n\nregional studies (e.g., western South Africa (Davey, 1971), North Atlantic Ocean \n\n(Williams, 1971)). In 1977, Wall et al. released a landmark study, based on 168 samples \n\nfrom fourteen geographical regions of mainly the North and South Atlantic oceans \n\nand adjacent seas, which set the basis for an ecological classification of dinoflagellates \n\ncysts as proxies to environmental-climatic factors characterizing different \u201cwater-\n\ntypes\u201d, particularly sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity. Two main trends, \n\nrelating to distance to the shore (estuarine, estuarine-neritic, neritic, neritic-ocenic \n\nand oceanic) and to latitude-climate (cool water of temperate zones, warm water of \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n64\n\ntropical and subtropical zones) were identified in the distribution of marine cyst-\n\nbased taxa. These two gradients have been consistently replicated in more recent and \n\ngeographically broader studies, with sea surface temperature typically explaining the \n\nlargest variance of species distributional data (Marret &amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Zonneveld \n\net al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2008). \n\nTwo other fundamental contributions of the Wall et al. (1977) paper involve the \n\nconceptual framework for an ecologically relevant interpretation of cysts distribution \n\nin the sediments and, related to it, the consideration of diversity signals within cyst \n\nassemblages, in addition to differences in species composition and the peak abundance \n\nof individual taxa (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). \n\nMost organic-walled cyst producing dinoflagellates inhabit shallower-waters \n\nalong continental margins characterized by unstable and unpredictable (i.e., displaying \n\nhigh seasonal variability and irregular recurrence of conditions) hydrographic regimes \n\n(Wall et al., 1977; de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007). Consistent to what might be expected \n\nfrom an evolutionary adaptive standpoint, the most abundant taxa tend towards a \n\ncosmopolitan opportunistic distribution, exhibiting broad tolerance to salinity \n\ngradients (euryhaline properties), little thermal preference (eurythermic properties), \n\nslender differentiation along the inshore-offshore component and incipient speciation \n\n(limited to slight variations in features of cyst morphology, such as processes and \n\nspines) (Wall et al., 1977). \n\nThese generalist taxa, due to their geographical ubiquity, are of reduced value \n\nto palaecological reconstructions. Those of greatest interest correspond to focused \n\nadaptations, at the species level, to stable sectors of the aquatic environments, typically \n\noccurring at the terminal/subterminal portions of the salinity and thermic regimes \n\n(Wall et al., 1977). Examples of such stenotopic taxa are the stenohalines Leptodinium, \n\nadapted to fully saline ocean water, and Gonyaulax apiculata, found only in freshwater \n\nlake sediments (Wall et al., 1977), or the stenothermics Impagidinium Palidum, adapted \n\nto cold ocean waters, and Islandinium, used as a marker of seasonal sea-ice cover (de \n\nVernal &amp; Marret, 2007). Fig. 16 illustrates these two sorts of adaptation to the thermic \n\nand salinity domains: generalist adaptation, tolerant to wide range variations and \n\nleading to cosmopolitan distributions (eurytopic taxa), and specialized adaptation \n\nto the terminal sectors of these domains, reflected in geographically restricted \n\ndistribution patterns (stenotopic taxa).\n\nWhile inshore-offshore and latitudinal distributional trends are primarily reflected \n\nin the peak abundance (or exclusive occurrence) of different taxa in their optimum \n\nenvironments, they are also manifest in changes of species associations (co-occurring \n\nspecies) both across environment-climatic units and along the transitional regions in \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n65\n\nbetween them (e.g., estuarine-coastal or neritic-ocean transitions). This is consistent \n\nwith the view that cysts assemblages arise from the combination of ecological groups \n\nthrough hydrographic mixing, so that species associations express the cumulative \n\neffects of individual taxa distributions (Wall et al., 1977).\n\nFigure 16 - Diagrammatic representation of the distribution of a number of extant dinocysts in the \nsediments according to climatic regions (entailing distinct degrees of thermic-related tolerance) and of their \ncorresponding salinity-related tolerance (slightly modified from de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007). The asterisk \u201c*\u201d \nindicates taxa exclusively found in the northern Hemisphere; the \u201co\u201d signals taxa only found in sediments \nof the southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to these two indices, Wall et al. (1977) promoted a measure of species \n\ndiversity (number of species in an assemblage after normalization to the sample size: \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n66\n\nsee Hurlbert, 1971), widely accepted among ecologists to reflect the amount of stress \n\nin ecosystems (higher diversity associating with lower stress). Inshore-offshore and \n\nlatitudinal trends were again detected with the diversity index, showing seaward \n\naugmented diversity and an increase towards low latitudes (intertropical areas, with \n\nlow seasonal temperature constraints) in both hemispheres. Less ecologically stressed \n\nenvironments were thus coincident overall with the more stable and predictable ones, \n\nand diversity was most often augmented by the occurrence of a small set of more \n\nstenotopic species in addition to a background of cosmopolitan species (Wall et al., \n\n1977).\n\nPearce (2000) proposed in this sense that a ratio of cyst species diversity to their \n\nabsolute abundance be used as an index of environmental stability-predictability \n\n(SPI), with increasing values indicating higher stability. Also, considering its broad \n\nalignment with an inshore-offshore direction, the diversity index can be cautiously \n\nused as an indicator of shoreline proximity, changes in sea level and the occurrence of \n\ntransgressive-regressive phases. As indicated by Pross &amp; Brinkhuis (2005), dinocysts-\n\nbased reconstruction of sea-levels has been chiefly based on (1) studies of assemblage \n\ncomposition and (2) studies of the diversity and abundance within assemblages.\n\n5.3.2. Dinocysts-based environmental signals and new sets of environmental \n\nfactors \n\nOn the following of the Wall et al. (1977) paper, which laid down a framework for \n\nthe use of dinocysts in palaeoceanographic studies, many regional studies of cysts \n\ndistribution and their relation to environmental indices were conducted (for an \n\nextensive enumeration, covering the period from 1980 to early 2000-ths, see Marret \n\n&amp; Zonnevel, 2003; see also de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007), and a first map of recent \n\ndinocysts in bottom sediments from the North Atlantic Ocean (and adjacent seas) \n\nwas published by Harland in 1984. More updated databases were later provided for \n\nthe North Atlantic Ocean (Rochon, de Vernal, Turon, Matthiessen, &amp; Head, 1999; \n\nde Vernal et al., 2001), leading to an Atlas of the world-wide distribution of modern \n\norganic-walled dinocysts, including the relationships of their relative abundance to \n\nsurface-water parameters, released by Marret and Zonnevel in 2003. A new extended \n\nversion of this Atlas, published by Zonneveld et al. in 2013 on the basis of information \n\ngathered from 2045 sites (comparing to 835 in the early version) affords, to the best \n\nof our knowledge, the most comprehensive source on extant dinocysts geographical \n\ndistribution and its relation to environmental factors.\n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n67\n\nOne noticeable feature of the more recent studies of dinocysts ecology is the \n\nenlargement of environmental parameters considered. Nitrates and phosphates \n\n(nutrients) concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentrations (indexing phytoplankton \n\nproduction), and bottom water oxygen concentrations (indexing the redox state of \n\nbottom waters) have thus also been included as environmental parameters in the \n\nZonneveld et al. (2013) synthesis, in addition to more standard measures of annual and \n\nseasonal SST and salinity. New relationships between cysts assemblages and oxidation, \n\nan important taphonomic factor which differentially affects organic-walled cysts taxa \n\n(Zonneveld, Versteegh, &amp; Kodrans-Nsiah, 2008), sea-surface productivity and trophic \n\nregimes could in that way be exploited and made available for use in palaecological \n\nreconstructions (see the species ecological classification on each environmental \n\nparameter proposed in Zonneveld et al. (2013).\n\nGiven the above said, the number of ecological signals to be derived from \n\ndinocysts assemblages has naturally grown. In 1996, Dale identified six cyst-based \n\nsignals, relating to coastal versus oceanic waters, salinity, sea-level temperature, and \n\nsea-water productivity (including, e.g., oceanic upwelling and coastal eutrophication), \n\nwhich all depended on the species composition of assemblages (Dale, 1996, 2001). \n\nA number of other signals may currently be added to the former, concerning, e.g., \n\nbenthic oxygenation and ventilation of water columns (see Pross, 2001), stratification \n\nof water masses and circulation of surface water (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005), sea-ice \n\ncoverage, SST seasonality, or transport mechanisms (de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007). \n\nFurthermore, ecological signals have increasingly been linked to a network of \n\nspecific indices (qualitative and/or quantitative) which often contribute to more \n\nthan one type of signal. For instance, an increase in the proportion of heterotrophic \n\nspecies in cysts assemblages \u2013 commonly assessed by the ratio Protoperidiniaceae/ \n\nGonyaulacaceae (P/G, with P-cysts taken to be mostly heterotrophic, and G-cysts \n\nautotrophic) \u2013 may indicate changes in ocean upwelling intensity, augmented \n\nproductivity unrelated to upwelling (due, e.g., to SST changes) or eutrophication in \n\nsystems without previous nutrients limitation (Dale, 2001); hence, additional indices, \n\nsuch as changes in cysts concentration and the concrete species associations (namely, \n\nlow vs. high latitude taxa), need to be jointly considered in order to distinguish \n\namong the alternatives (Dale, 2001; de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007). Conversely, distance \n\nto the shoreline may be indicated by a prevalence of taxa with known oceanic/\n\nneritic distributions, changes in the diversity signal in the assemblages, or simply an \n\nincrease/decrease of dinocysts abundance (cyst-producing dinoflagellates being mostly \n\nconfined to coastlines, marked abundance speaks in favor of shoreline proximity) \n\n(Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005; de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007; Taylor et al., 2008). Such indices \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n68\n\nhave been broadly used in reconstructing sea level changes (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). \n\nHowever, many parameters mediate the relationship between cysts distribution and \n\nthe nearshore-offshore gradient (e.g., water turbulence, water stratification, nutrients \n\navailability, long distance transport), calling on a cautious interpretation of results \n\nand on a multi-proxy approach to palaeoenvironmental inferences. For example, the \n\nimpact of transport mechanisms on the assemblage might be evaluated with the \n\n(pollen + spores)/dinocyst ratio (Pol/Din), taken to reflect the terrestrial vs. marine \n\norigin of the organic flux (see de Vernal, 2009, and de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007, who \n\nrefer to this ratio as a \u201ccontinentality\u201d index). An updated synthetic presentation and \n\ndiscussion of many of the environmental indices and ecological signals available from \n\norganic-walled dinocysts is provided by de Vernal &amp; Marret (2007).\n\nPross &amp; Brinkhuis (2005) indicate as two main advantages of using organic-walled \n\ndinocysts as (palaeo)environmental tracers (1) their sensitivity to even slight changes \n\nof several properties of surface waters (particularly temperature, where they compare \n\nfavorably to most other microfossils), and (2) their abundance in neritic sediments, \n\naffording complementary information to that derived from offshore calcareous \n\nand siliceous fossil groups such as c. Even if much less studied, the potential (pala)\n\necological relevance of calcareous dinocysts in the sediments of open oceanic waters \n\n(Dale &amp; Dale, 1992) has received growing attention as a source for the reconstruction \n\nof upper water conditions (especially productivity, stratification and surface water \n\ncurrents) in domains where organic-walled cysts are inexistent (Vink, 2004; Vink, \n\nBrune, Holl, Zonneveld, &amp; Willems, 2002; Wendler, Gr\u00e4fe &amp; Willems, 2002; Wiese, \n\nZobel, &amp; Keupp, 2015). Freshwater dinoflagellate cysts have also known a regain \n\nin interest as ecological/environmental proxies. In an up to date review, Mertens, \n\nRengefors, Moestrup, and Ellegaard (2012) documented their potential usefulness \n\nin palaecological reconstructions, namely as indicators of temperature, pH and \n\nproductivity (despite the fact that only a few freshwater dinocysts have the potential \n\nto fossilize). De Vernal (2009) has accorded them a role in assessing the freshwater \n\nversus marine character of sediments, and thereby in the reconstruction of sea level \n\nchanges.\n\n5.3.3. Dinocysts-based palaeoecology \n\nThe palaecology of organic-walled dinocysts has been mostly studied in Quater-\n\nnary marine sediments, due to the abundance of extant taxa allowing for an \n\nactuopalaeontological approach (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005) and the use of robust \n\n\n\nDinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology\n\n69\n\nquantitative reconstruction methods, such as the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT: \n\nsee de Vernal, 2009; Simpson, 2007). Some of those studies, concerning in particular the \n\nlate Quaternary, were specifically motivated by environmental goals, such as gaining \n\na better understanding of eutrophication and pollution (Dale, 2001, 2009). The last \n\ninterglacial period before the present one, corresponding to the Eemian stage in \n\nthe Pleistocene, has been the focus of a considerable number of palaeoceanographic \n\nstudies based on dinoflagellate cysts (e.g., Head, 2007; Van Nieuwenhove, &amp; Bauch, \n\n2008). Dinocysts-based reconstructions of palaeoceanographic conditions and \n\npalaeoclimates in the Neogene, both during the Miocene (e.g., Louwye, Foubert, \n\nMertens, Van Rooij, &amp; IODP Expedition 307 scientific party, 2008) and the Pliocene \n\n(e.g., Head &amp; Westphal, 1999), were also proposed. As for the Paleogene, important \n\nclimatic events such as Earth\u2019s greenhouse-icehouse transition (e.g., Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, \n\n2005; Sluijs, Pross, &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005) and the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum \n\n(e.g., Sluijs et al., 2008) were addressed resorting to dynocist studies (see also Pross, \n\n2001, addressing the palaeo-oxygenation of epeiric settings in the Oligocene). \n\nMesozoic studies using organic-walled cysts as palaeoenvironmental tracers are \n\nscarcer. Most of the references included in Riding\u2019s (2012, 2013, 2014) compilation of \n\nthe literature on Triassic, Jurassic, and earliest Cretaceous dinoflagellate cysts concern \n\ndinoflagellates taxonomy and biostratigraphy, with only residual examples of attempts \n\nat palaeoecological reconstructions. Moreover, for reasons related to the extensive \n\nnature of marine strata and the diversity of dinocysts of the Late Jurassic (Riding, \n\n2012), most of the studies are focused on the Jurassic period, with little coverage of \n\nthe Cretaceous. \n\nAmong the organic-walled cyst-based palaeoenvironmental studies of the Late \n\nCretaceous (which includes the stratigraphic time interval of interest in our study, \n\ni.e. the Cenomanian Age), most deal with the palaeoceanographic conditions during \n\nthe Cenomanian-Turonian transition. Noteworthy examples are Pearce, Karvis, and \n\nTocher (2009), and Peyrot, Barroso-Barcenilla, and Susanne Feist-Burkhardt (2012), \n\nfocusing, respectively, on a reference section in England and an outcrop in Central \n\nSpain. In addition to the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, Lignum (2009) also \n\naffords palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of the Albian/Cenomanian boundary, \n\nand the mid-Cenomaniam across several palaeogeographical regions. Examples of a \n\nfew palaecological studies addressing other time intervals include Dodsworth (2016), \n\nfocusing on the middle to upper Cenomanian, Skupien (2003), focusing on the \n\nupper Barremiam-Albian ages of the Lower Cretaceous, and Pestchevitskaya (2008), \n\nfocusing on a Berriasian to Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) section of the Siberia \n\npalaeobasin.\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n6.1. SAMPLING\n\nAs a first required step, a stratigraphical profile was elaborated at the base of the south \n\nside of the Nazar\u00e9 promontory, including a section with 13,5 meters and 49 strata \n\nencompassing alternate layers of marls and limestones with biostromes of Ilymatogyra \n\npseudoafricana and a sequence of laminitic marly levels with Gyrostrea ouremensis (see \n\nsection 3.4 in chapter 3 for details). Careful sedimentological analysis of the profile \n\nhelped determine which layers afforded the most convenient lithology for sample \n\ncollecting. The main criteria used were the type of granulometry (preferably thin) \n\nand the color of the sediment (a darker sediment would be preferred as it allows \n\ninferring a larger quantity of organic matter). The joint use of these criteria led to \n\nthe selection of the marly levels in the profile as the most suitable ones, providing the \n\narray of layers from which the samples were then collected. \n\nSamples were extracted from distinct marly levels, well separated apart in the \n\nprofile, so as to provide a perspective on the distribution of dinoflagellates and other \n\npalynomorphs throughout the spanned time interval. Accordingly, samples were \n\ntaken from layers more near the base, the middle and the top section of the profile. \n\nFurthermore, within each sampled layer, 2 or 3 samples were taken from the base, \n\nthe middle (in case there were 3 samples) and the top of the layer. Accounting for \n\nthe requirements of the subsequent laboratorial processing procedures, the amount \n\nof collected sediment for each sample was set to 200 grams.\n\nMETHOD AND PROCEDURES\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n72\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Correspondence between samples (11) and layers (4) in the stratigraphic column. T, M, and \nB respectively designate the top, middle and base sections in each layer.\n\nA total of 11 distinct samples were taken from four distinct layers of the geological \n\nprofile. The first three samples were taken from the base, middle and top of stratum \n\nn\u00ba 47 in the stratigraphic column. Three samples were similarly collected from the \n\nlower, middle and upper sections of stratum n\u00ba 33, and three other from the upper, \n\nmiddle and lower sections of stratum n\u00ba 15. The two final samples were taken from \n\nstratum n\u00ba 16. Given that this particular layer was only 10 cm thick, only two samples \n\nwere collected, one from the base and one from the top (see Fig. 17).\n\nAdditional care was taken in keeping the sampling restricted to the inner \n\nsediments in each layer, avoiding the top sediments, typically more exposed and \n\nvulnerable to contamination. The collected sediments were placed in appropriate \n\nplastic bags which were properly identified and taken to the laboratory for analysis. \n\nSandy limestone Fish remains\n\nIchnofossils\n\nCarbonaceous remains\n\nFragments of turtle shells\n\nBivalves\n\nGastropods\n\nEchinoids\n\nHorizontal lamination\n\nSedimentary discontinuity\n\nOblique strati?cation\n\nMarl\n\nLimestone\n\nMarly limestone\n\nBreccia\n\n1m\n\n08\n\n47\n\n33\n\nSamplesSamples\n\nT1\n\nM1\n\nB1\n\nT4\nB4\nT3\nM3\nB3\n\n15\n16\n\nLEP/B\n\nT2\n\nM2\n\nB2\n\n[ T: top  M: middle  B: base ]\n\n\n\nMethod and Procedures\n\n73\n\n6.2. PALYNOLOGICAL PROCESSING\n\nThe fluxogram presented in the following (Fig. 18) summarizes the sequence of \n\nprocedural stages leading from the sample collecting to the final palynological \n\nprocessing (Costa, 2015).\n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Fluxogram of processing stages.\n\nAs noted by L. Castro (2006), \u00aba good palynological procedure depends on the \n\n\u201cknow-how\u201d of each researcher, astuteness and technique, along with some personal \n\ninvolvement. It is essential to have access to adequate equipment\u00bb (p. 87). Since I was \n\ngiven the opportunity to go through the laboratorial procedures in the Laboratory of \n\nPalynology of the LNEG, Porto, the standard palynological techniques of the LNEG \n\nwere employed, which include consecutive treatments of the sampled material with \n\nchloridric and fluoridric acids. Several of these procedures have been the subject of \n\ncareful descriptions in Borges (2012) and A description of the main features of these \n\nfour processing stages is given below:\n\nPhysical fractionation - After being cleaned, samples were smashed into thinner \n\nparticles (which potentiates the action of the acids) with a suitable hammer (Fig. 19). \n\nThe resulting fragments were then washed in tap water in order to remove subsisting \n\nlarger sized particles which might react violently to the acids.\n\n11 samples \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1.

The sediment underwent several attacks with acids with \n\ndifferent concentrations, in order for the mineral fraction to be progressively removed. \n\nThis was performed in a laboratory hood that limited exposure to toxic fumes and \n\nfacilitated the handling of the chemical products. Three consecutive acid attacks were \n\napplied:\n\n(1) With hydrochloric acid (for the elimination of carbonates): the samples \n\nwere submitted to a 48 hours treatment with hydrochloric acid (20% \n\nconcentration), which can be extended to 4 days, if necessary. The volume \n\nof hydrochloric acid used was always enough to cover all of the sediment, \n\nand effervescence had to cease completely before proceeding to the next \n\ntreatment step. In case effervescence was excessive, a few drops of alcohol \n\nwere added as a means to control it. The solution was then diluted with tap \n\nwater (passing through a filtering system) and additionally filtered (15 ?m \n\nsieve) to remove any chlorides that may have formed. Before removing the \n\nfluid, the sample was left to decant for a minimum of 4 hours, allowing \n\npalynomorphs to deposit during that time; \n\n(2) With hydrofluoric acid (for the elimination of silicates): hydrofluoric acid \n\n(37% concentration) was added to the residue for a period of 6 to 10 days. \n\nThis reaction generates a lot of heat, with the potential to damage the cups or \n\neven endanger the person who is conducting the procedure. For that reason, \n\nthe cups were placed in cold water so that the resulting heat from the reaction \n\ndissipates. To boost the effect of the acid, they were then revolved periodically \n\n\n\nMethod and Procedures\n\n75\n\n(twice a day), the residue was subjected to successive decantations, and the acid \n\nrenewed. After the sample was completely disaggregated, it was neutralized \n\nthrough consecutive decantations with water and subsequently filtered; \n\n(3) With hydrochloric acid (for the elimination of fluorides and sulfides): a hot \n\nattack with HCl was conducted to eliminate secondary minerals like insoluble \n\nfluorides and sulfides that might have resisted the previous treatments. The \n\nsolution was boiled for about 5 minutes to eliminate the remaining mineral \n\nfraction. As in the previous stages, the remaining sediment was diluted, \n\ndecanted and filtered (15 ?m filter) until the water became transparent and \n\nthe acid was completely removed. In case a considerable mineral fraction \n\nsubsisted after these procedures, the sample was again submitted to chemical \n\ntreatment with HF for about 12 to 24 hours.\n\nFollowing these three attacks, the remaining residue was cleaned with dispersant \n\n(for the elimination of thin mineral matter), washed and sieved (15 ?m sieve) (see \n\nFig. 20C). In cases where leftovers of resistant minerals remained in the sediment, the \n\ntreatment with hydrofluoric acid was repeated. When there was the further need to \n\neliminate soluble organic matter (which hampers the observation of the lamina on \n\nthe microscope), oxidation of the residue was induced, followed by a new cycle of \n\nwashing and sieving, which concluded the demineralization stage.\n\nFigure 20 \u2013 A.

Washing \nand sieving. D. Storage of the concentrated organic residue in labeled vials.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n76\n\nConcentration of the organic content - In some samples, the resulting organic \n\nresidue after the demineralization was scarce and a considerable mineral fraction had \n\nresisted the series of acid attacks. Two methods were then applied for the concentration \n\nof the organic residue. In samples with a really high mineral content, separation of the \n\nmineral and the organic fraction was achieved by using zinc chloride (znCl\n2\n), a high \n\ndensity liquid (2gm/cm3). The residues, placed in tubes, were centrifugated at 4000 \n\nr.p.m for 5 minutes (with a balanced weight per tube). After the supernatant water \n\nwas eliminated, about 5 ml of znCl\n2 \nsolution was added to each tube, which was then \n\nshaken and had their weight adjusted. A further 5 minutes centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m \n\nwas performed, following which the supernanant, containing the concentrated organic \n\nresidue, was removed with a pipette. The collected residue was examined under the \n\nmicroscope and, if no mineral fraction was detected, transferred to a beaker where \n\nthe solution was neutralized with water. Otherwise, a new centrifugation cycle took \n\nplace. After neutralization, the final residue was washed, filtered with a 15 ?m sieve, \n\nand stored in small and properly labeled vials (Fig. 20D).\n\nFor samples with a low remaining mineral fraction, a second method was used. \n\nConcentration of the organic matter was then achieved by panning in a watch glass \n\nwith water. The supernatant was removed with a pipette and the process repeated \n\nseveral times, so that all the organic matter could be removed. The recovered organic \n\nresidue was then stored in properly identified small vials with water. A drop of diluted \n\nHCl was added to the vials in order to avoid fungal proliferation.\n\nPreparing the slides for microscopic analysis - With the concentrated organic \n\ncontent moved to glass made beakers, a few drops of hydroxyethylcellulose (dispersant) \n\nwere added to the solution to favor the dispersal of the palynomorphs at the time \n\nthe lamellae were assembled. The solution was then manually agitated to become \n\nhomogeneous and distributed by several lamellae with a pipette. These were placed in \n\nan appropriate greenhouse and left to dry at a constant temperature of 30\u00baC (Fig. 21B). \n\nThe lamellae were labeled and assembled as microscope slides, using acrylic resin \n\n(Entelan\u00ae) as mounting medium. After a 2 hours rest, for the resin to settle and dry, \n\nthe microscope slides were ready to be observed. As preliminary observations of \n\nthe first slides revealed that the palynological content was not optimally visible, the \n\npractice was adopted of using a biological stain (Safranin) to highlight the structures \n\nof dinoflagellates and other palynomorphs. Several slides from each sample were \n\nthus prepared after first staining the organic fraction with Safranin for a period of 15 \n\nminutes to 4 hours (see Fig. 21A). These slides were then studied on a biological SMI \n\nmicroscope (Olympus BX40 e Camara Olympus C5050).\n\n\n\nMethod and Procedures\n\n77\n\nFigure 21 \u2013 A.Organic fraction stained for 4 hours with Safranine.

GROUPS OF PALYNOMORPHS AND THEIR RELATIVE \n\nABUNDANCE\n\nAnalysis of the palynological content of the samples disclosed the occurrence of \n\ndistinct groups of palynomorphs, including 20 dinocysts taxa, 17 sporomorph taxa \n\n(of which 2 angiosperm and 9 gymnosperm pollen types, and 6 cryptogam spores), 4 \n\ntaxa of green-blue algae, common to abundant microforaminiferal linings and a single \n\nacritarch specimen.One scolecodont, one specimen of Diphyes sp. and a few dinocyst \n\ntype A were also recorded.The identified taxa of dinocysts, spores, angiosperm \n\npollen, gymnosperm pollen and algae are alphabetically listed in Tables 2 and 3, \n\nalong with their suprageneric affiliations and an associated code referring to their \n\nmicrophotographic illustration in the plates provided in Annex 1. Due to excessive \n\nfragmentation of the organic residual, two (T2 and T3) of the eleven samples were \n\npalynologically barren and are thus not considered in the following analyses. \n\nThe relative abundance of these distinct groups in each of the 9 positive samples \n\nis graphically represented in Fig. 22. These percentages were based on a counting \n\nof 157-233 palynomorphs/sample, with an average counting of 184 palynomorphs \n\nper sample. Samples are vertically arranged so as to reflect, from top to bottom, the \n\nlocation of the sampled layers in the stratigraphic column (number 1 corresponds to \n\nlayers more towards the top, number 2 to layers near the middle, and numbers 4 and \n\n3 to layers more towards the base of the profile). Within each layer, corresponding \n\nto a row, samples are also arranged in a top-down order, with T standing for the top,  \n\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS  \nAND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n80\n\nM for the middle and B for the base of the corresponding layer.\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Taxa of found dinocysts.

Microforaminiferal linings and pollen grains alternate, \n\ndepending on the samples, as the second most abundant group, with an advantage of \n\nmicroforaminifera in samples M1, B4 and B3, and of pollen grains in T1, B1, M2, T4 \n\nand M3 (equal representation in B2). \n\nSpores occupy the following position, after dinocysts, pollen and microforaminiferal \n\nlinings, in relative abundance, overcoming microforaminiferal linings in B1, B2 \n\nand T4 samples, and surpassing the percentage of pollen grains in B2 and B3. \n\nExcept for samples B1 and M2, where they reach percentages of, respectively, 10% \n\n(overcoming microforaminiferal linings) and 7 % (matching the pollen percentage \n\nand again overcoming microforaminiferal linings), green-blue algae have only residual \n\noccurrence in a few other samples. The single recorded acritarch specimen represents \n\n0,58% of the palynomorph content of sample B4.\n\nA joint comparative appreciation of how these percentages vary across samples \n\ncan be obtained from the stacked area chart of Fig. 23, which additionally affords a \n\nstraightforward relation between samples and levels in the stratigraphic succession. \n\nThe T2 and T3 barren samples (enclosed within brackets) are also located as regards \n\nthe succession for convenience, but they have no corresponding values in the chart.\n\nThe largest reductions in dinocysts relative abundance (to 46 %) occur at M3 \n\nfollowed by B4 (57%) and B1 (58%). These reductions are related to somewhat distinct \n\npatterns of increase of other groups of palynomorphs: in M3 it is the relative increase \n\nof pollen grains and, although to a much lesser extent, of spores (i.e., the terrestrial \n\ncomponent) that associates with the reduction in the percentage of dinocysts; in \n\nB4, an increase of the relative abundance of microforaminiferal linings (included in \n\nthe aquatic-marine component) contributes as well to that reduction; and in B1, \n\nin addition to important relative increases of pollen and spores, increased relative \n\nabundance of both the algae and the microforaminiferal (aquatic component) is also \n\nassociated with the diminished percentage of dinocysts. \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n83\n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Pie charts showing the relative percentages of different categories of palynomorphs in each \nproductive sample.

The largest increases in dinocysts percentages \n\noccur in turn at T1 (to 85%) and M2 (to 81%): in T1 this is correlative of a decrease \n\nof all other groups; in M2, it associates primarily with a strong reduction of the \n\nspores content, accompanied by an also significant reduction of pollen grains (i.e., it \n\nis chiefly correlative of a reduction of the terrestrial component).\n\n7.2. RELEVANT PALYNOLOGICAL RATIOS \n\nSeveral quantitative indexes of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological features \n\nhave been proposed based on ratios between different types of palynomorphs (see \n\npoint 4.3.2 above). Among them, one of the most common is the terrigenous versus \n\nmarine ratio, computed as the sum of pollen grains and spores (representing the \n\nterrestrial influx) divided by the number of dinocysts (representing the marine \n\ninflux) (de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007) Although complicated by a possible differential \n\nimpact of oxidation conditions on the preservation of dinocysts and sporomorphs \n\nor by the importance of long-distance transport mechanisms (leading some authors \n\nto propose the exclusion of bisaccate pollen (e.g., Fern\u00e1ndez-Marr\u00f3n, Gil, Gil-Cid, \n\n&amp; Fonoll\u00e1-Ocet, 2010), higher values of this ratio can be taken to signal greater \n\nproximity to the shoreline, the reason why Vernal and Marret (2007) termed it a \n\n\u201ccontinentality\u201d index. Graph A in Fig. 24 plots this ratio (on the ordinate) as a \n\nfunction of the productive samples (on the abscissa, ordered from the top to the \n\nbottom of the stratigraphic column). Values are in all cases below 1, reflecting the \n\noverall predominance of the marine influx. With the exception of sample M3, where \n\nthe ratio approaches 1 (close to even contribution of terrestrial and marine fluxes), \n\nthe remaining values are actually below 0.5, reflecting a marked dominance of the \n\nmarine component. \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n86\n\nFigure 24 \u2013 A. Changes of the pollen to dinocysts ratio [(pollen + spores)/dinocysts] across samples (on \nthe abscissa, moving downward in the stratigraphic sequence). B. Ratio of bisaccate pollen to other pollen \nacross the samples. C. Ratio of pollen to spores across the samples. \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n87\n\nThe red line helps to highlight a slight tendency for higher values of this ratio \n\nfor samples located towards the bottom of the stratigraphic succession (T4 to B3, as \n\ncompared to T1 to M2 or to B2). \n\nAnother proposed palynological ratio for evaluating increases/decreases in \n\ndistance from seashore is the bisacatte pollen versus other pollen ratio (B:O). Due \n\nto their sac-like appendices, which make them more aero- and hydrodynamically \n\nefficient for long distance transport, bisaccate conifer pollen tends to increase their \n\nrelative proportion as overall pollen concentration decreases with distance from the \n\ncoastline (e.g., McCarthy, Mudie, Rochon, Gostlin, &amp; Levac, 2000; Rochon &amp; de \n\nVernal, 1994; de Vernal, 2009). As any other single palynological ratio, this one may \n\nalternatively reflect factors other than an onshore-offshore gradient, such as changes \n\nin the plant communities at the source of the terrestrial influx. Graph B in Fig. 24 \n\nplots the B:O ratio as a function of the productive samples, ordered according to \n\ntheir location (from top to bottom) in the stratigraphic profile. Bisaccate pollen, \n\nrepresented in the examined samples by Alisporites sp., correspond in every sample \n\nto a small proportion of the pollen grains, which is reflected in the consistently low \n\nvalues of this ratio. A small trend for an increase of the B:O ratio in samples located \n\nmore towards the bottom of the profile (to the right of M2 in the abscissa) can also \n\nbe noticed, but still associated with rather low ratio values.\n\nThe ratio of pollen grains versus spores (P:S) has also been used as a proxy for \n\ndistance to the shoreline, given the greater ease with which pollen can be wind or \n\nwater-transported away from their origin (Batten, 1996), but mostly as a proxy for \n\npalynomorph oxidation. Since spores resist better to oxidation, the ratio P:S tends to \n\nbe higher in environments of rapid sediment accumulation and burial (McCarthy et \n\nal., 2000). The Graph C in Fig. 24 expresses this ratio (on the ordinate) as a function \n\nof the top-down succession of productive samples, on the abscissa. With the exception \n\nof sample B2, pollen predominate over spores in all samples, resulting in ratio values \n\nabove 1. The red line helps detecting a trend for higher values in samples more \n\ntowards the top of the profile, suggestive of higher rates of sediment accumulation \n\nthan those associated with layers lower down in the succession.\n\nOne widely used dinocyst-based indicator for assessing primary productivity \n\nconditions, first documented by Lewis, Dodge, and Powell (1990), is the Peridinioids \n\nversus Gonyaulacoids ratio (P:G). The inferential basis for the use of this ratio rests \n\non taking Peridinioids as a close approximation to heterotrophic dinoflagellate \n\nspecies (Pross &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). Evidence for that comes from an analogy with \n\nthe prevailing feeding behaviour of modern Protoperidinioids and from Quaternary \n\nstudies, leading several authors to question its relevance for Cretaceous studies (Dale \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n88\n\n&amp; Fjells\u00e5, 1994). Nevertheless, several externally calibrated studies (e.g., using satellite \n\ndata on primary productivity as a criterion) supported the potential usefulness of this \n\nratio for productivity reconstruction (e.g., Radi &amp; de Vernal, 2008). The dominance of \n\nperidinioid cysts in Cenomanian-Turonian assemblages is a common finding (Peyrot \n\net al., 2012), and has been linked to several other environmental controls besides \n\nprimary productivity. For instance, the predominance of peridinioids in reduced \n\nsalinity conditions has been contrasted with the predominance of gonyaulacoids and \n\ngymnodioids in normal marine salinity conditions (Harker, Sargeant, &amp; Caldwell, \n\n1990). Peridinioids comparative increase in nearshore conditions characterized by \n\nstrong fluctuations in salinity and/or nutrient levels has also been signalled (Peyrot et \n\nal., 2012). Moreover, peridinioid-dominated assemblages have been correlated with \n\ncolder surface waters (and higher latitudes, Dale, 1985) and gonyauculoid-dominated \n\nassemblages with warmer surface waters (Wall et al., 1977). Finally, selective destruction \n\nof peridinioids by oxidation has been demonstrated in laboratory (Marret, 1993, \n\nHopkins &amp; McCarthy, 2002) and a reduced occurrence of peridinioids in oxidised \n\nsediments has been documented (Zonneveld, Hoek, Brinkhuis, &amp; Willems, 2001). \n\nA decrease in the P:G ratio may thus reflect oxidation related processes such as rate \n\nof sedimentation, which differentially affect these two groups of cysts. Both the link \n\nof this ratio to primary productivity and to the rate of sedimentation open up the \n\npossibility of cautiously using it to estimate a nearshore-offshore gradient, with lower \n\nvalues of the ratio indicating more distal environments (de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007).\n\nGraph A in Fig. 25 plots a simple ratio of number of Peridinioids/(number of \n\nPeriodinioids + Gonyaulacoids) expressed as a relative percentage (0 to 100 %) as a \n\nfunction of the top-down succession of productive samples. A clear predominance of \n\nperidinioids is manifest by relative percentages well above 50% in all samples. . Given \n\nthe aforesaid, this overall predominance is in itself suggestive of reduced or variable \n\nsalinity, temperate/cold water, and high productivity associated with nearshore \n\nconditions (e.g., lagoonal, estuarine or brackish).\n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n89\n\nFigure 25 \u2013 A: 100% stacked area chart presenting the percentage of peridinioid and gonyaulacoid dinocysts \nacross samples (on the abscissa, moving downward in the stratigraphic sequence). B: Dinocysts (dashed line) \nand pollen and spores (solid line) species richness across samples: richness was indexed simply by the number \nof species identified in a sample.\n\nA trend for a comparative reduction in the proportion of peridinioids (correlative \n\nof an augmented proportion of gonyaulacoids) is apparent after M2, i.e., for samples \n\ncollected at lower levels of the stratigraphic columns. Interpreted in light of a distal-\n\nproximal gradient, that would point to closer proximity to land at the top of the \n\ncolumn, in agreement with the suggestions of the bissacate/other pollen ratio \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n90\n\n(graph B in Fig. 25); considered from the standpoint of oxidation processes, to an \n\nincreased rate of sedimentation/burial on the higher layers \u2013 in agreement with \n\nthe suggestion of the Pollen/Spores ratio (graph C in Fig. 24). In this context, the \n\nincrease of the terrestrial component in samples from the lower layers suggested by \n\nthe (pollen + spore)/dinocyst ratio (graph A in Fig. 24) appears as either discrepant \n\nwith the remaining indicators or as requiring explanation by factors other than \n\nhigher proximity to land.\n\nOther palynological-based signals have been proposed, namely regarding the \n\ninshore-offshore gradient, which are not based on quotients and can be used for \n\ncross-checking the indications arising from palynological ratios. Particularly in the \n\ncase of dinocysts, highly indicative species (with marked preferences for specific \n\nenvironments) and assemblages\u2019 composition may afford useful signals, which will \n\nbe dealt with in the following sections. After the Wall et al. (1977) paper, dinocysts \n\ndiversity has come to be recognized in itself as a relevant palaeoenvironmental \n\nindicator, overall dependent on the stress in ecosystems, which is often related to \n\nshoreline proximity (Sluijs, Pross, &amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). Dinocysts diversity has been \n\nfound to typically increase offshore (particularly near the shelf edge, along slope-\n\nrise zones) and to decrease at more proximal settings, particularly in unstable and \n\nunpredictable (more ecologically stressed) estuarine/coastal habitats (Bradford &amp; Wall, \n\n1984; Goodman, 1979; Wall et al., 1977). Graph B in Fig. 25 plots a straightforward \n\nmeasure of dinocysts diversity (the number of recorded distinct taxa, or species \n\nrichness) as a function of the productive samples ordered from the top towards the \n\nbottom of the profile. An equivalent measure of diversity was also taken for the \n\nterrestrial component represented by spores and pollen grains and is additionally \n\nplotted for comparison (dashed line). The number of distinct dinocyst taxa in each \n\nsample is overall rather low (always below 15) and thus suggestive of a near shore, \n\nproximal setting, rather than open marine. In addition, it is quite constant, with only \n\nvery small fluctuations between samples. A similar pattern is apparent for the pollen \n\n+ spore diversity, with the exception of a somewhat noticeable fall in B2 (extending, \n\nto a lesser degree, to T4). Pollen + spore richness was always lower than dinocysts\n\nrichness.\n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n91\n\n7.3. CHARACTERIZATION OF DINOCYST ASSEMBLAGES\n\nSubtilisphaera sp. was by far the dominant taxon in all samples, accounting for around \n\n71 % of the total of recorded dinocysts. Its representation across samples varied from \n\na minimum of ? 46 % (sample T4) to a maximum of 88 % (sample B1). The second \nmost abundant taxa, at a considerable distance from the third one, was Spinidinium \n\nsp., accounting for ? 7% of the total number of dinocysts, and with percentages \nacross samples varying in between ? 2,5 % (sample B2) and ? 17,5 % (sample T4). \nSpiniferites ramosus was the third most common taxa, with an overall representation \n\nof ? 3,2%, varying from 0% (in M1 and B3) to ? 15,5% (B4) across samples. The first \ntwo taxa, both peridinioids, which together account for more than 75 % of the entire \n\ndinocysts count, were recorded in all samples. \n\nThis pattern of species representation, graphically illustrated by the dinocyst \n\npercentage diagram in Fig. 26, reflects high dominance assemblages, with an \n\noverwhelming prevalence of the cosmopolitan species Subtilisphaera sp. An inverse \n\nrelation between dominance and species diversity has been signalled by Goodman \n\n(1979), such that low dominance-high diversity assemblages reflect more offshore \n\nconditions and high dominance-low diversity assemblages more inshore conditions. \n\nThe high dominance found in all samples thus converges with the low number of \n\ndinocysts taxa recorded (low diversity) in signalling an innershore marine setting. \n\nMoreover, assemblages including only a few dinocyst species and overwhelmingly \n\ndominated by one single taxon have been particularly associated with ecologically \n\nrestricted nearshore and estuarine (brackish) environments (Li &amp; Habib, 1996; \n\nMcMinn, 1991), with relatively low energy and little water movement, leading to the \n\nsuggestion that this may be the case here.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n92\n\nFigure 26 \u2013Dinocyst percentage diagrams for the set of productive samples (ordered vertically as in the \nlitostratigraphic column).\n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n93\n\nRelatively small fluctuations of the percentage representation of each taxon across \n\nsamples are apparent in Fig. 26. A comparatively higher peak of Florentinia sp. can be \n\nseen at B3, of Spiniferites ramosus at B4, of Canningia sp. and Spinidinium sp. at T4, of \n\nXiphophoridium alatum at B2 or of Heterosphaeridium sp. at T1sample. These fluctuations \n\nare associated with some degree of change in the species composition across \n\nsamples and may involve either inverse or direct relations between the percentage \n\nrepresentation of different species, which will be considered in the following sections. \n\nFig. 27 presents the relation across samples between the proportions of \n\nSubtilisphaera sp., the most abundant peridinioid cyst and the dominant taxon \n\noverall, and of Spiniferites ramosus, the most abundant gonyaulacoid (and third best \n\nrepresented taxon). An overall inverse relation can be noticed, whereby increases in \n\nthe proportion of Spiniferites ramosus (gonyaulacoid) are accompanied by decreases \n\nin the proportion of Subtilisphaera sp. (peridinioid) and vice versa. A tendency for an \n\nenlarged representation of Subtilisphaera sp. on samples from higher layers indicates \n\nan increasing gradient of dominance towards the top of the succession (M2 to T1). \n\nThe ratio between the number of distinct peridinioid and distinct gonyaulacoid \n\ntaxa was also computed for each sample and plotted on the same graph, with values \n\non the left ordinate. This ratio allows examining whether the increased dominance \n\nof Subtilisphaera sp. at samples located higher in the stratigraphical succession goes \n\nalong with an overall pattern favouring the occurrence of higher species richness of \n\nperidinioids over gonyaulacoids. As shown by the dashed line, this appears to be the \n\ncase, with some trend for larger values of the ratio on the left part of the abscissa. This \n\nrelative increase in species richness of the peridionoids concurs with the increased \n\ndominance of Subtilisphaera sp. and with the enlarged representation of peridinioids \n\nas a group (see Fig. 25A) to suggest augmented productivity and/or more reduced or \n\nvariable salinity conditions of the palaeoenvironments associated with layers higher \n\nup in the succession. \n\nPearson correlations computed between all pairs of dinocyst taxa similarly \n\nindicate that an overall inverse relation between peridinioids and gonyaulacoids \n\nlargely organizes the variation in species composition across samples. Statistically \n\nsignificant (at ? ? 0.05, bilateral) negative correlations were found between \nSubtilisphaera sp. (dominant peridinioid) and the gonyaulacoids Spiniferites ramosus \n\n(r = -0.743), Canningia sp. (r = -0.767), Spiniferites sp. (r = -0.756) and Xenascus \n\nsp. (r = -0.813). Although they didn\u2019t reach the statistical significance criterion, the \n\nremaining correlations of Subtilisphaera sp. with other gonyaulacoids (excluding those \n\noccurring in less than three samples) were also negative, with two exceptions (r ? 0 \nfor Xenascus ceratioides and r = 0.373 for Heterosphaeridium sp.). \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n94\n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Full lines: changes in the proportion of the peridinioid Subtilisphaera sp.

Values should be read on the \nright vertical axis. Dashed line: ratio of the number of Peridinioids taxa (Peridinioids species richness) to \nthe number of Gonyaulacoids taxa (Gonyaulacoids species richness) across samples. Values should be read \non the vertical left axis.\n\nOnly one significant correlation, negative in sign, r = -0.774, was found between \n\nSubtilisphaera sp. and any of the other peridinioid cysts, involving Spinidinium sp., \n\nthe second most ubiquitous and abundant taxon overall. Under the reservation that \n\nthey were not statistically significant, negative correlations also occurred between \n\nSubtilisphaera sp. and Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides, r = -0.427, and Epelidosphaeridia \n\nspinosa, r = -0.140.These negative correlations may cautiously be taken to suggest \n\na competitive relationship between the dominant Subtilisphaera sp. and some of the \n\nother peridinioid species. Positive non-significant correlations emerged in turn with \n\nTrithyrodinium suspectum, r = 0.373, and Trithyrodinium sp., r = 0.171 (because it only \n\noccurred in one sample, Palaeohystrichophora sp., was not considered). No significant \n\ncorrelations between peridinioid taxa other than the one involving Subtilisphaera \n\nsp. and Spinidinium sp. were found. All significant correlations found between \n\ngonyaulacoid species (6 correlations, after discarding species occurring in less than \n\n3 samples) were positive, indicating that their percentage representations tended to \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n95\n\nincrease or decrease as a block. A significant negative correlation, r = -0.691, occurred \n\nbetween the gonyaulacoid Heterosphaeridium sp. and the peridinioid Epelidosphaeridia \n\nspinosa.\n\nAnother look at the distribution of dinocysts across samples is provided in Table \n\n4, which classifies each taxon in terms of abundance (percentage of the total count of \n\npalynomporphs in each sample). Three classification categories were used, following \n\nthe terminology and percentage criteria offered in Balme (1970): rare, for percentages \n\n&lt;1%; common, for percentages from 1.1 to 10%; abundant, for percentages > 10%.\n\nThe absence of several golyaulacoid taxa in T1, M1, B1 samples (e.g., Canningia \n\nsp., Florentinia mantellii, Spiniferites sp., Xenascus sp., Xiphophoridium alatum) reflects \n\nthe signalled reduction in species richness of the gonyaulavoids in samples higher \n\nup in the succession (lowest values, of 2 and 4 taxa out of 13, occur at M1 and B1 \n\nrespectively, and highest ones, of 10 and 7 taxa, occur at B2 and T4 respectively). \n\nPeriodinioid taxa, in turn, have their highest species richness in T1 and M1, with \n\n6 out of 7 taxa present). Using the rare (R) category to characterize dominance in \n\ndinocysts associations, the highest percentage of rare taxa, indexing higher dominance, \n\noccurs at T1 (58%) and the third highest value at M1 (37.5%), samples located higher \n\nin the stratigraphic succession. Considering now the abundant (A) and common (C) \n\ncategories to characterize the prevalent species association, Subtilisphaera sp. (abundant \n\nin all samples), Spinidinium sp. (abundant in one sample and common in every other), \n\nSpiniferites ramosus (common in all seven samples where it occurs), Xenascus ceratioides \n\n(common in five out of seven samples where it occurs) and Florentinia sp. (common in \n\nfive out of six samples where it occurs), appear as the most widely shared taxa across \n\nsamples. Commonly represented in four out of seven and four out of five samples, \n\nrespectively, the peridinioids Epelidosphaeridia spinosa and Trithyrodinium suspectum are \n\nalso fairly transversal across assemblages.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n96\n\nTable 4 \u2013 Stratigraphic distribution of dinocysts. Occurrences in each sample are \n\nclassified as R-Rare (&lt;1%), C-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and A-Abundant (> 10%) \n\n(Balme, 1970).\n\nCanningia sp. and Spiniferites sp. contribute specifically to assemblages recorded in \n\nsamples lower down in the section (B3, M3, B4, T4), where they are always common. \n\nThey seldom co-occur with Heteosphaeridium sp. and Trithyrodinium sp., which are \n\nrestricted to higher-up samples (in between B2 and T1), the former being common \n\nin three out of three samples, and the latter common and abundant, respectively, in \n\ntwo out of five samples). Xiphophoridium alatum and Xenascus sp. only occur at lower \n\nto middle samples in the section, the former being restricted to T4 (where it is \n\ncommon) and B2 (where it becomes abundant), and the latter occurring commonly \n\nin samples B4, T4 and B2. These taxa with occurrences restricted to distinct sample \n\nranges suggest that, in addition to a widely shared basic association comprising six or \n\nseven taxa, some degree of differentiation may be established between assemblages \n\nmore towards the lower and more towards the upper parts of the succession.\n\nThe environmental preferences of dinocysts taxa have been recognized as \n\nimportant palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological indicators.

As previously \n\nnoticed, strong peridinioid dominance is a common finding in Cenomanian-Turonian \n\nassemblages (Peyrot, 2012), generally accepted as a signal of increased nutrient supply \n\nand/or reduced salinity under nearshore conditions (Wall et al., 1977; Lewis et al., \n\n1990). However, while Palaeohystricophora infusorioides has currently emerged in those \n\nassemblages as the dominant cyst (Lignum, 2009; Pearce et al., 2009; Peyrot et al., \n\n2011; Peyrot et al., 2012), Subtilisphaera sp. is way far dominant in the present case. \n\nThis difference plausibly reflects differences in ecological preferences, and may thus \n\nhelp highlighting characteristic features of the palaeoenvironment associated with \n\nthe studied succession.\n\nAffinities of Subtilisphaera sp. to salt marshy, intertidal (Skupien &amp; Vac\u00edsec, 2002), \n\ndeltaic (Carvalho, Bengtson, &amp; Lana., 2016), estuarine and lagoonal low salinity \n\nenvironments (Jain &amp; Millepied, 1975) have been suggested. Its strong dominance \n\nin unstable estuarine (Pedr\u00e3o &amp; Lana, 2000) and lagoonal (Ji, Meng, Yan, &amp; Song, \n\n2011) settings supports moreover a marked euryhaline character, allowing for rapid \n\nopportunistic proliferation at the onset of marine transgressions (Pedr\u00e3o &amp; Lana, \n\n2000). Palaeohystricophora infusorioides has in turn been interpreted to show outer \n\nneritic, open marine affinities, with a predominance at offshore upwelling sites \n\nwith high primary productivity (Pearce et al., 2009; Peyrot, 2011; Skupien, 2007). \n\nDespite some tolerance for reduced salinity, which may account for its documented \n\noccurrence at nearshore environments (Habib &amp; Miller, 1989), it displays a preference \n\nfor close to normal salinity condition (Lignum, 2009). The overwhelming dominance \n\nof Subtilisphaera sp. in the present assemblages may thus be taken to suggest a restricted \n\nshallow marine to brackish environment, with either considerably reduced or variable \n\nsalinity conditions. Its increased dominance at samples upward in the succession \n\nmay additionally suggest a reinforcement of these conditions towards the top of the \n\nstratigraphic profile (i.e., an increasingly restricted, less open marine sedimentation \n\nenvironment).\n\nThis interpretation is overall consistent with the ubiquitous occurrence of \n\nSpinidinium sp., the second most abundant recorded taxon, which displays a preference \n\nfor marginal marine environments (Sluijs, Brinkhuis, Williams, &amp; Fensome, 2009; \n\nWillumsen &amp; Vajda, 2010) and low salinity conditions, including those associated \n\nwith fluvial freshwater input (Sluijs &amp; Brinkhuis, 2009). Several other taxa in the \n\nassemblages exhibit akin tendencies: \n\n- Xenascus ceratioides, whose relationship with restricted shallow marine (Tocher &amp; \n\nJarvis, 1987; Skupien &amp; Mohammed, 2008) and low to varying salinity settings \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n98\n\n(Lister &amp; Batten, 1988; Wilpshaar &amp; Leereveld, 1994) appears well established; \n\n- Trithyrodinum sp. and Trithyrodinium suspectum, typical occurrences of nearshore \n\nshallow marine environments with a sizeable terrestrial influx (Skupien &amp; \n\nMohammed, 2008) and often associated with marginal marine dinocysts genera, \n\nsuch as Spinidinium (Willumsen &amp; Vajda, 2010); \n\n- Canningia sp. and Canningia reticulata which, within a general inner neritic propensity, \n\nhave been related to lagoonal and restricted marine (Hunt, 1987; Peyrot, 2011, \n\nSkupien, 2007) varying salinity environments (Harris &amp; Tocher, 2003; Skupien, \n\n2007), though with a preference for hiposaline waters (Lignum, 2009); \n\n- Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum, considered to be a euryhaline species with an affinity \n\nto reduced salinity nearshore environments (Harris &amp; Tocher, 2003; Lebedeva, \n\n2010; Lignum, 2009). \n\nAlthough not much seems to be known about the palaeoecological preferences \n\nof Impletoshphaeridium spp., except for an affinity to cold waters (Warny, Anderson, \n\nLondeix, &amp; Bart, 2007), its recorded occurrence at a restricted infralittoral neritic \n\nmarine environment (Borges, Riding, Fernandes, Matos, &amp; Pereira, 2012) may be \n\ntaken to suggest a propensity for nearshore shallow waters. Together with Subtilisphaera \n\nsp. and Spininidum sp. these taxa make up to 86 % of the total count of dinocysts.\n\nSome of the other recorded taxa testify for distinct, open marine affinities. The \n\nstenohaline Epelidosphaeridia spinosa is widely regarded as a marker of offshore/\n\noceanic environments (Harris &amp; Tocher, 2003; Lignum, 2009); Florentia spp., in \n\nparticular Florentinia mantellii, exhibit middle to outer-shelf affinities, with a leaning \n\nfor outer environments (Omran, Soliman, &amp; Mahmoud, 1990; Pearce, 2000; Peyrot et \n\nal., 2011); the cosmopolitan Heterosphaeridium sp. has been credited with full marine \n\naffinities (Ellegaard, Lundholm, Ribeiro, Ekelund, &amp; Andersen, 2008), preferential \n\ndistribution in the inner to middle-shelf and a propensity for close to normal, slightly \n\nreduced salinity (Lignum, 2009). As mentioned above, Palaeohystricophora infusorioides \n\nalso reveals outer neritic preferences, being often considered a marker of offshore \n\nupwelling zones (Pearce, 2000; Lignum. 2009, Peyrot et al., 2011). The cosmopolitan \n\nspecies Spiniferites ramosus, corresponding to the most overall abundant gonyaulacoid \n\n(about 3% of the total dinocysts count), represents a special case. Despite recognized \n\nouter neritic affinities (Lignum, 2009, Mao &amp; Lamolda, 1998, 1999; Peyrot, 2011), it \n\ndisplays broad tolerance to variations in primary productivity (from oligotrophic to \n\neutrophic conditions), permanent or seasonal (e.g., due to river discharges) reductions \n\nin water salinity and water temperature changes (Zonneveld et al., 2013), and \n\ncan thus be found in a wide range of habitats, including nearshore shallow-water \n\nenvironments (Carvalho et al., 2016). Finally, Xiphophoridium alatum has shown no \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n99\n\npalaeoenvironmental preferences as regards salinity or water-depth (Harris &amp; Tocher, \n\n2003). \n\nTaken altogether, the overall composition of the assemblages is thus suggestive \n\nof a low salinity, possibly brackish setting, involving restricted shallow conditions \n\nconsistent with lagoonal and/or tidal flat environments. The very low number of taxa \n\npresenting open marine, particularly outer neritic and oceanic affinities (4), and the \n\nscarcity of their percentage representation (excluding Spiniferites ramosus, due to its \n\nwide range of habitats, they account for about 6% of the total dinocysts sum) indicates \n\na moderate degree of exposure to open marine influxes, possibly due to restricted \n\n(e.g., by barriers) tidal influx. The interpretation given above of the increasing \n\ndominance of Subtilisphaera sp. in samples higher up in the succession as a possible \n\nindication of a reinforcement of these palaeoenvironmental characteristics is to some \n\nextent supported by an upward increase in the representation of Xenascus ceratioides, \n\nTrithyrodinium suspectum, Trithyrodinum sp., Canningia reticulata and Oligosphaeridium \n\npulcherrimum, and a better representation of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides, Florentinia \n\nmantellii and Spiniferites sp. at samples lower down in the succession (B3 to T4 or to \n\nB2), although the increased representation of Canningia sp. at samples lower in the \n\nsuccession would not be expected under this scenario (see Table 4).\n\nAssemblages reflect a predominant Tethyan influence, signalled by the occurrence, \n\namong some of the best represented taxa, of species with a recognized Tethyan affinity, \n\nsuch as Subtilishphaera sp. (Arai, Neto, Lana, &amp; Pedr\u00e3o, 2000; Arai, 2014), Spinifirites spp. \n\n(Carvalho et al., 2016), Florentinia spp. (Skupien &amp; Vasicek, 2002), Xenascus ceratioides \n\n(Masure, Aumar, &amp; Vrielynck, 2013). Only of few taxa exhibit high latitude affinities, \n\nsuch as Xiphophoridium alatum (Williams et al., 2004), which nevertheless presents \n\na cosmopolitan distribution (Masure et al., 2013). In accordance with the lack of \n\ntypically Temperate or Boreal species, several taxa exhibit preferences for warm water, \n\nsuch as Trithyrodinium suspectum (Willumsen &amp; Vajda 2010), Spiniferites sp. (Prauss, \n\n2002), Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum and Palaeohystricophora infusorioides (Uwins &amp; \n\nBatten, 1988). Impletospheridium sp. and Heterosphaeridium sp. appear in turn to prefer \n\ncooler water temperatures (Arai, 2007; Warny et. al, 2007). The absence of Spiniferites \n\nsp. and the decreased representation of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides, two taxa with \n\na specific affinity for well oxygenated waters (Courtinat &amp; Shaaf, 1990), at samples \n\nhigher up in the succession, might signal upward decreasing oxygenation in the \n\nassociated palaeoenvironmental. All in all, the most important palaeoenvironmental \n\ncontrols for the species composition of the assemblages and namely the overwhelming \n\ndominance of Subtilisphaera sp., seem to be nutrient availability under a restricted \n\nshallow water environment with reduced (and eventually varying) salinity.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n100\n\n7.4. CHARACTERIZATION OF OTHER PALYNOMORPHS \n\nASSEMBLAGES\n\nTable 5 provides a classification of sporomorphs, algae, microforaminiferal linings and \n\nacritarchs in terms of abundance (percentage of the total count of palynomorphs in \n\nthe sample), based on the same criteria used above for dinocysts: R-Rare (&lt;1%), \n\nC-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and Abundant-A (> 10%). \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Stratigraphic distribution of spores, pollen, algae, foraminifera and acritarchs. \n\nR-Rare (&lt;1%), C-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and Abundant-A (> 10%).\n\nSpores: the pteridophyte spore Pattelasporites sp., commonly found in several \n\nlandscapes from the mid-Cretaceous Iberian Peninsula (Hasenboehler, 1981; \n\nVillanueva-Amadoz, 2009), was the only ubiquitous taxa across samples and also the \n\nmost abundant, being common in all samples except T1 (where it becomes rare). \n\nIt is followed by the also pteridophyte spore Cicatricosisporites sp., already recorded \n\nin the Cretaceous of Portugal (Rey, 1972), which can be found in many diverse \n\nenvironments, from marine to lagoonal and terrestrial (see: Fossilworks: Gateway to the \n\nPaleobiology Database, accessible at http://www.fossilworks.org/). Combined with the \n\nmuch larger representation of pollen grains versus spores (see Fig. 24C), the strong \n\npredominance of spores of pteridophytes, and the absence of bryophytes spores \n\n(more dependent on water for their reproduction) may signal a moderately humid \n\npalaeoclimate (Villanueva-Amadoz, Sender, Diez, Ferrer, &amp; Pons, 2011).\n\n    For.

Alisporites is the only bisaccate pollen, much less \n\nrepresented than other pollen types (see also Fig. 24B), suggesting a low influence \n\nof transportation and a deposition close to the production site of the pollen grains. \n\nClassopolis-dominated assemblages have been interpreted as corresponding to coastal \n\nvegetation (Peyrot et al., 2011). A similar association of conifer pollen, predominantly \n\nClassopollis, with spores of pterydophytes, chiefly Pattelasporites, has been reported \n\nfor the Lower Cretaceous of the Lusitanian Basin (Mendes, Dinis, &amp; Pais, 2014), \n\nand interpreted to indicate a warm, seasonally dry climate. This would agree, in the \n\npresent case, with the tangentially rare representation of Afropollis, the only recorded \n\ntype of angiosperms pollen, possibly associated with humid tropical climates (Doyle, \n\nJardin\u00e9, &amp; Doerenkam, 1982). \n\nAlgae: Among the recorded taxa of marine algae, Leiosphaeridia sp. (recorded at \n\nB1 and B2 samples) and Pterospmella sp. (recorded at B4) have been well correlated \n\nwith shallowing phases in Jurassic studies (Tahoun &amp; Mohamed, 2014), suggesting \n\nan overall shallow environment. The most abundant type, with common occurrence \n\nhigher up in the succession (M2 and B1) is Botryoccocus sp., a fresh-water/brackish \n\nalga (Guiry &amp; Guiry, 2017; El Beialy, El Afty, Zavada, &amp; Khoriby, 2010). Besides an \n\noverall indication of reduced salinity, possibly corresponding to a fluvial influence on \n\nthe palaeoenvironment, its common occurrence higher up in the profile may indicate \n\na reduction in salinity upwards. The prevalence of salinity reduced conditions is also \n\nsupported by the presence of the other, prasynophyte-type algae, which typically \n\nsignal lower salinity of surface waters and exhibit a preference for lagoonal to brackish \n\nenvironments (Skupien &amp; Vasicek, 2002).\n\nMicroforaminiferal linings: Several studies have shown an increase in microforaminiferal \n\nlinings in shallower waters (Melia, 1984; Powell, Dodge, &amp; Lewis, 1990), allowing to \n\ninterpret the common to abundant occurrence of microforaminifera across samples \n\n(with the single exception of T4, where no microforaminifera linings were recorded) \n\nas an indication of an overall shallow water palaeoenvironment. No particular \n\nshallowing trend upwards in the succession is suggested. \n\nTaken overall, the study of the assemblages of palynomorphs other than \n\ndinocysts concurs with the same general indications of a shallow water nearshore \n\npalaeoenvironment with reduced salinity, possibly of a lagoonal/brackish type and \n\nallowing for some contribution of river freshwater input.\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n102\n\n7.5. DINOCYSTS-BASED BIOSTRATIGRAPHY\n\nThe usefulness of dinocysts as biostratigraphic markers is highly dependent on the \n\noccurrence of biostratigraphically relevant species/genera, that is, taxa with a narrow \n\nchronostratigraphical range in between their first occurrence (FO) and their last \n\noccurrence (LO), allowing thereby for low resolution correlation. This was not the \n\ncase of the studied assemblages, which individually do not add diagnostic value as \n\nregards the proposed age of the succession from late early Cenomanian to early \n\nmiddle Cenomanian on the basis of foraminifera, benthic faunas of invertebrates, \n\nand even ammonoid and vertebrate assemblages (e. g. Berthou, 1973, 1984; Berthou, \n\nSoares, &amp; Lauverjat, 1979; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014). \n\nFig. 28 illustrates the range of the recorded dinocysts taxa across samples with \n\nreference to the geological time scale (Gradstein et al., 2012) (28A) and to the first \n\n(arrow with up bar) and/or last (arrow with down bar) occurrence of four taxa \n\ndocumented in this study and figuring among those selected in Williams et al.

(2004) for the selected \n\ndinocysts taxa in the Cenomanian, affording thereby a comparative basis for possible \n\nbiostratigraphic inferences.\n\nFollowing Williams et al. (2004), Xiphophoridium alatum has its FO in the lower \n\nCenomanian. In the present study it occurs for the first time in sample T4, where it is \n\ncommon. This may thus be taken to mean that, from sample T4 upward, the age of the \n\nsuccession cannot be inferior than the lower Cenomanian (which is consistent with \n\na middle Cenomanian age, but does not add an independent calibration index to the \n\nexisting ones). The Albian FO of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides and of Epelidosphaeridia \n\nspinosa (following William\u2019s et al., 2004) has even lesser biostratigraphical value: given \n\nthat both taxa have their FO in the lowermost sample of the studied stratigraphical \n\nsuccession (B3), they may only indicate that the entire succession is postearly than \n\nAlbian age.

The possible inference is that the succession age is \n\npre-Turonian (which, again, is consistent with the middle Cenomanian age already \n\nproposed, but does not afford any new specific calibration index to this datation). \n\nThe common occurrence of Trithyrodinium suspectum in several of the samples of \n\nthe stratigraphic column, including the lowermost (B3) and uppermost (T1) ones, \n\nis a particular case. According to William et al. (2004), Trithyrodinium suspectum FO \n\nis referred to the middle of the upper Cenomanian (an indication already afforded \n\nin Williams &amp; Bujak, 1985). The possible inference would then be that the studied \n\nsuccession is at least of upper Cenomanian age. In conclusion, the Nazar\u00e9 section \n\nprovided an age of middle upper Cenomanian to latest Cenomanian based on \n\ndinoflagellates cysts (Fig. 28B).\n\nThis result suggests an upper age for the Nazar\u00e9 section than the robust middle \n\nCenomanian age provided by numerous other micro and macro biostratigraphic \n\nmarkers (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014). Additional palynostratigraphic sampling \n\nin the studied section could provide additional relevant data, and eventually support \n\nthe need for a revision of the FO of Trithyrodinium suspectum in Late Cretaceous in \n\nIberia (while recognizing that no further evidence in the literature points in that \n\ndirection).\n\n7.6. COMPARISON WITH OTHER CRETACEOUS DINOCYSTS \n\nASSEMBLAGES\n\nMost studies of Upper Cretaceous dinocysts concern the upper Cenomanian and \n\nparticularly the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, given its association with the \n\nmajor biotic event known as OAE 2 or Bonarelli Event (Hart et al., 2005; Pearce \n\net al., 2009; Barroso-Barcenilla et al., 2011). Comparisons of the found dinocysts \n\nassemblages with coeval assemblages obtained in other studies (either specifically \n\naddressing or encompassing the late early and middle Cenomanian) in the same or \n\ndistinct palaeogeographical realms are thus met with limited opportunities. \n\nTwo earlier studies conducted in Portugal which allow a comparison with the \n\npresent one are those of Berthou et al. (1980) and Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler (1982). \n\nThey both investigate the Albian and Cenomanian dinocysts associations in the region \n\nof Lisbon (south of Nazar\u00e9) and distinguish furthermore between the early, middle \n\nand late Cenomanian stage. Besides the indication that dinocysts are considerably \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n105\n\nmore abundant in the Albian than in the Cenomanian in the studied region, Berthou \n\net al. (1980) report that dinocysts occurrences were rare in both the early and middle \n\nCenomanian, with Trichodinium castaneum as the single identified species. These \n\nfindings diverge from those in the present study, where diverse and relatively well \n\nrepresented dinocyst taxa were found in samples corresponding in all likelihood to \n\nthe middle Cenomanian, though not the very single taxa identified by Berthou et al. \n\n(1980) for this time interval (Trichodinium castaneum). This discrepancy might signal \n\ncoeval diverging local sedimentological and palaeoenvironmental conditions at the \n\nLisbon and Nazar\u00e9 sectors. \n\nThe study of Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler (1982) has provided a much larger \n\ndiversity of taxa occurring during the early and middle Cenomanian (32 taxa ranging \n\nin the early and middle Cenomanian, although virtually all of them shared with \n\nAlbian substages and many of them with the late Cenomanian one). A comparative \n\nsummary of Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler\u2019s (1982) reported taxa is given in Table 6 \n\n(middle column). All taxa shared with the present study are represented in bold: \n\ndominant taxa in a given Cenomanian substage and do not occurring in any other \n\nsubstages are additionally reported and signalled with two asterisks (**), and taxa \n\nceasing to occur after a given substage are marked with an asterisk (*). Taxa within \n\nbrackets ([ ]) are not of interest for the current comparison.\n\nNine of the 20 dinocysts taxa identified in the present study (i.e., 45%) were also \n\nreported in Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler (1982). However, rather than being specific to \n\none stage, they largely spread across the three Cenomanian substages. While all occurred \n\nat the middle Cenomanian, seven were also reported in the early Cenomanian and \n\nthree in the late Cenomanian. With the exception of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides \n\nidentified only in the Cenomanian (across all substages), all other taxa also range \n\nacross several Albian substages. Nevertheless, five of these shared taxa did not occur \n\nafter the middle Cenomanian (taxa in bold followed by an asterisk), suggesting that \n\nthe presently studied succession is bellow the basal upper Cenomanian, as already \n\ncomproved by other taxonomic groups. \n\nHowever, no indications in the relevant literature support a key biostratigraphical \n\nvalue of these particular taxa, excepting Epelidosphaeridia spinosa for the whole \n\nCenomanian (Williams &amp; Bujak, 1985; Williams et al., 2004). Concerning \n\nEpelidosphaeridia spinosa, its last occurrence is located by Williams et al. (2004) in late, \n\nnot middle Cenomanian, which attributes it a diagnostic value as a pre-Turonian \n\nspecies, but not as regards a distinction between Cenomanian substages. \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n106\n\nTable 6 \u2013 Shared taxa (bold type) between the dinocysts assemblages of the present \n\nstudy and those from Cenomanian-Turonian sections of the Castilian Platform \n\n(Spain) and from Albian-Cenomanian sections of the Western Portuguese Basin \n\n(Lisbon region).

(1980) \n\nand with the results of the present study is that, as far as the lower, midlle and upper \n\nCenomanian are concerned, dinocyst-based studies do not seem to add significantly \n\nto the biostratigraphic precisions in the studied regions. However, this does note \n\nmean that they cannot be useful for integrated biostratigraphic purposes with other \n\ntaxonomic groups.\n\nAnother relevant indication supported by the fact that 65 % of the taxa in the \n\ncurrent study, among which the dominant and the second most abundant genera, \n\nwere absent from Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler\u2019s (1982) samples, is that, again, coeval \n\npalaeoenvironmental conditions at the Lisbon and Nazar\u00e9 regions were very \n\nlikely divergent. This suggests that, in contrast to their seemingly reduced value \n\nfor biostratigraphical purposes in the Cenomanian (at least in the studied settings \n\nof the WPCP), dinocyst-based studies may be important sources in assessing \n\npalaeoenvironmental conditions and palaeoecological communities, and differences \n\namong coeval distinct palaeogeographical regions.\n\nIn the left column of Table 6, a summary comparison with the findings of three \n\ndinocysts studies conducted at different sites of the Castilian Platform, Northern-\n\nCentral Spain (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011, and Peyrot et al., 2012) is presented. \n\nAlthough these studies were concerned with late Cenomanian-early Turonian \n\nstratigraphic intervals, not equivalent thus to the proposed late early-middle \n\nCenomanian interval addressed in the current study, they still afford interesting \n\npossibilities for comparison. During the Late Cretaceous, the Iberian Subplate shared \n\ngeneral tectonic, latitudinal, palaeogeographical and eustatic sea-level influences \n\n(Peyrot et al., 2012; Segura et al., 2014), which might reflect in some general affinities \n\nbetween dinocysts assemblages. In addition, the three Spanish studies involve \n\ndistinct outcrop sections corresponding to an outer shelf to coastal and terrestrial \n\ntransect (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011), opening the possibility for assemblages\u2019 \n\ncomparisons across distinct palaeoenvironmental settings. Finally, assessing the extent \n\nto which taxa identified in the present study occur (or not) in the upper Cenomanian \n\nsuccessions of settings with an overall akin palaeogeographic location (between the \n\nTethyan and the Boreal Realms) affords additional means to evaluate the specificity \n\nof the recorded assemblages. \n\nDespite differences in assemblage\u2019s diversities and composition, interpreted by the \n\nauthors as expressing mainly the distal-proximal gradient, a transversal predominance \n\nof Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus was found in all Spanish \n\nstudies (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011; Peyrot et al., 2012). This concurs with a \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n108\n\ncommon dominance of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides during the middle and \n\nlate Cenomanian in most NW areas (Lignum, 2009), very often associated with \n\nSpiniferites ramosus, leading to the recognition of an Upper Cretaceous \u201cSpiniferites-\n\nPalaeohystrichophora (S-P) Assemblage\u201d (Prince, Jarvis, &amp; Tocher, 1999), expressing \n\neutrophic conditions of the middle shelf. As shown in Table 6 (left column), eight \n\nof the 20 taxa recorded in the present study (i.e., 40%) are represented in the late \n\nCenomanian-early Turonian assemblages of the Castilian Platform (taxa in bold), \n\nwith four of them among the six most abundant taxa in the Spanish studies (ordered \n\nby abundance and accounting for more than 75% of the total count). Conversely, \n\n60% of the taxa in the present study are absent in the Castillian Platform assemblages, \n\namong which the largely dominant Subtilisphaera sp. and the second most ubiquitous \n\nand abundant taxon Spinidinium sp., expressing a rather different species composition \n\n(and namely, an important divergence as regards the P-S assemblage, which seems to \n\nprovide the basic association in the Spanish samples). Given the interpretation of the \n\nP-S assemblage as a marker of eutrophic middle-shelf environments, the contrasting \n\ndominance of Subtilisphaera sp. in the present study, with reported affinities to restricted \n\nmarginal low salinity environments, should be taken as a clear signal of a local \n\npalaeoenvironmental divergence. All three Spanish studies have used the dinocysts \n\nassemblages for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological inferences, but only one \n\nexamined their value as biostratigraphic markers in the concerned stratigraphic \n\ninterval (Peyrot, 2011), with limited results given by the absence of reliable late \n\nCenomanian-early Turonian markers in the samples (p. 269). Of particularly interest \n\nto the present study, none of the potentially useful biostratigraphical indications \n\nreported seems able to provide a distinctive signal of the late Cenomanian substage \n\n(i.e., simultaneously excluding earlier Cenomanian substages and the later Turonian \n\nage). These results appear to generalize the suggestion that Cenomanian dinocysts \n\nare much less useful for improving the resolution of stratigraphic datations than for \n\npalaeoenvironment reconstructions.\n\nFinally, a last set of studies of Cenomanian dinocyst assemblages used for comparison \n\nwere provided in Lignum (2009). These studies concern seven Cenomanian sections \n\nfrom NW Europe (Culver Cliff and Folkestone, UK, Vergons and Pont d\u2019Issole, \n\nSE France, and Wunstorf, Ratssteinbruch and Gr\u00f6bern, Northern Germany), \n\nselected so as to represent a Boreal\u2013Tethyan transect (North Boreal represented by \n\nthe German series, South Boreal by the UK sections, and Tethyan by the French \n\nsections) and a range of palaeoenvironments, namely as regards seawater depth. The \n\nCenomanian interval being their proposed focus, most include samples taken from \n\nthe standard European ammonite zones of Mantelliceras dixoni, corresponding to the \n\n\n\nPresentation, Analysis and Discussion of results\n\n109\n\nupper lower Cenomanian, and Acanthoceras rothomagense and Acanthoceras jukesbrownei, \n\ncorresponding respectively to the lower and upper middle Cenomanian (Kennedy &amp; \n\nGale, 2006). These zones, particularly the Acanthoceras rothomagense one, offer a close \n\nstratigraphical equivalent to the beds with Pterocera incerta, or level B sensu Choffat \n\n(Callapez, 1998), from which the succession in the present study was selected, meaning \n\nthat comparisons can be made with coeval assemblages. \n\nAgain, despite variations in species composition of the assemblages, \n\nPalaeohystrichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus (followed by Chlamydophorella \n\nnyei) predominated in most of the samples, with an increased representation of \n\nPalaeohystrichophora infusorioides during the early to early middle Cenomanian at \n\nseveral locations (Anglo-Paris, Vocontian and Lower Saxony basins), interpreted as \n\nthe effect of increased nutrients supply to shelf areas (Lignum, 2009). In addition \n\nto P. infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus, a few more taxa (Epelidosphaeridium spinosa, \n\nFlorentinia sp., Heterosphaeridium, Xenascus ceratioides) were shared by Lignum\u2019s (2009) \n\nassemblages and those of the present study, which nevertheless differed greatly in \n\ncomposition from the former, both in terms of the recorded taxa and of the distinctive \n\ndominance of Suptilisphaera sp. and the significant proportion of Spinidinium sp.. As \n\nbefore, these differences are consistent with a specific local palaeoenvironment of the \n\nNazar\u00e9\u2019s sector during the upper early-middle Cenomanian, departing from the inner \n\nto outer-shelf open marine environments represented in Lignum\u2019s (2009) samples. \n\nWhile the chief palaeoenvironmental controls of Cenomanian dinocysts assemblages \n\nappear to be sea-level, relative water depth and nutrient availability (Lignum, 2009), \n\nmarkedly reduced and/or variable salinity in a restricted shallow setting may have \n\ncontributed an important additional control to the mid-Cenomanian assemblages in \n\nthe Nazar\u00e9 sector.\n\nAs reported by Lignum (2009), the most significant changes in dinocysts \n\nassemblages occurred at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, and cannot improve \n\nas such the resolution of Cenomanian substages (Lignum, 2009). Last occurrences of \n\ntwo species in the Acanthoceras rhotomagense standard ammonite Zone (Endoceratium \n\ndettmanniae and Impagidinium crassimuratum subsp., none of them recorded in the \n\npresent study) were documented, but remain of doubtful significance as useful mid-\n\nCenomanian markers (Lignum, 2009). These results accord with and generalize the \n\nindications from the present study that Cenomanian dinocyst-based studies afford a \n\nvaluable path for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological reconstructions, but not \n\nso much for additional biostratigraphical calibrations. \n\n\n\n\n\n111\n\nThis dissertation was aimed at providing an integrated stratigraphic and palynological \n\nstudy, with a particular focus on organic-walled dinocysts sampled from an upper \n\nlower-lower middle Cenomanian section located near the base of the carbonated \n\nsuccession exposed on the south face of the Nazar\u00e9 promontory. This section comprises \n\na partial record of the \u201cBellasian\u201d stratigraphic units with Ilymatogyra pseudafricana and \n\nHarpagodes incertus (Callapez, 1998) (= \u201cLevel with Exogyra pseudafricana\u201d and \u201cLevel \n\nwith Pterocera incerta\u201d sensu Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Rey, 1979). Except for the \n\nanalysis of two samples collected by Moron (1981) at the detrital series beneath the \n\nfirst carbonate units, no other dinocysts studies have been conducted specifically at \n\nthe site of Nazar\u00e9, to the best of our knowledge.\n\n8.1. PALAEOENVIRONMENTAL AND PALAEOECOLOGICAL \n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nDrawing on the recognized potential of dinoflagellates cysts as palaeoenvirnommental \n\ntracers (de Vernal &amp; Marret, 2007; de Vernal &amp; Rochon, 2011; Rochon, Eynaud, \n\n&amp; de Vernal, 2008), one of the study\u2019s purported goals was to contribute to a \n\npalaeogeographic reconstruction of the Nazar\u00e9 sector during the early-middle \n\nCenomanian. This particular section has been previously interpreted, based on \n\nthe sedimentary facies and an extensive analysis of (mostly) macro invertebrate and \n\nFINAL DISCUSSION\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n112\n\nvertebrate faunas, as reflecting a transition from an inner-shelf carbonate platform \n\n(uppermost lower Cenomanian) to a more restricted lagoonal environment (basal \n\nmiddle Cenomanian) yielding benthic palaeocommunities dominated by the \n\noyster Gyrostrea ouremensis (Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014). An \n\ninteresting prospect in this context is thus assessing the convergence of microbiotic \n\ndata brought about by the study of dinocysts assemblages with the proposed regional \n\npalaeogeographic scheme (Callapez et al., 2014), and whether further constraints to \n\npalaeoenvironmental interpretations can be obtained thereby.\n\nThree structural features of the recorded dinocysts assemblages were: (1) high \n\ndominance, (2) low species diversity, and (3) a clear predominance of peridinioids \n\nover gonyaulacoids (with Subtilisphaera sp. alone representing over 70% of the total \n\ndinocysts count). As previously signaled, high dominance-low diversity assemblages \n\nare a common indicator of proximal innershore conditions (Goodman, 1979), with \n\nstrong domination by one single taxon, as is the case here, often related to restricted \n\nnearshore and estuarine (brackish) low energy environments (Bradford &amp; Wall, 1984; \n\nLi &amp; Habib, 1996; McMinn, 1991). Dominance of peridinioid cysts, on the other \n\nhand, is an accepted proxy for reduced/variable salinity under nearshore conditions \n\n(Harker et al., 1990) and/or abundant nutrient supply associated with upwelling zones \n\nor with enriched terrestrial input (Lewis et al., 1990; Peyrot at al., 2012; Wall et al., \n\n1977). All mentioned structural features thus converge in pointing towards a markedly \n\nnearshore, rather restricted, variable to low-saline, possibly brackish, environment \n\nwith a rich nutrient supply, plausibly of terrestrial origin. This palaeoenvironment \n\nwas in connection both with a large littoral/alluvial plain placed eastward, and the \n\ninner shelf sectors of a growing carbonate platform (Callapez, 2008).\n\nThe environmental preferences of the species/genera identified in the \n\nassemblages supported these indications and added further details. Diverging from \n\nthe Spiniferites-Palaeohystrichophora (S-P) Assemblage (Prince et al., 1999), predominant \n\nduring middle-late Cenomanian times in Northwest Europe and reflecting middle to \n\nouter shelf eutrophic conditions, the by far dominant cyst was the strongly euryhaline \n\nSubtilisphaeara sp., with reported affinities to restricted marine environments, \n\nincluding salt marshy, intertidal, deltaic, estuarine and lagoonal habitats (Carvalho \n\net al., 2016; Jain &amp; Millepied, 1975; Ji et al., 2011; Pedr\u00e3o &amp; Lana, 2000; Skupien &amp; \n\nVac\u00edsec, 2002). Consistent with this fact, specific preferences for marginal marine low \n\nsalinity conditions, namely those associated with fluvial freshwater inflow, have been \n\nattributed to the ubiquitous and second most abundant taxon, Spinidinium sp. (Sluijs &amp; \n\nBrinkhuis, 2009; Sluijs et al., 2009; Willumsen &amp; Vajda, 2010). Among the remaining \n\ntaxa, several display an akin propensity towards restricted environments of low to \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion\n\n113\n\nvarying salinities, along with documented occurrences in diverse marginal marine \n\nand lagoonal habitats: Xenascus ceratoides, Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum, Trithyrodinium \n\nsuspectum and Trithyrodinum sp., Canningia sp. and C. reticulata, Impletoshphaeridium spp. \n\n(Harris &amp; Tocher, 2003; Hunt, 1987; Lebedeva, 2010; Lignum, 2009; Lister &amp; Batten, \n\n1988; Peyrot et al., 2011; Skupien, 2007; Skupien &amp; Mohammed, 2008; Tocher &amp; Jarvis, \n\n1987; Warny et al., 2007; Willumsen &amp; Vajda, 2010; Wilpshaar &amp; Leereveld, 1994). The \n\nreduced representation (? 6%) of stenohaline taxa with open marine, and specifically \nouter neritic/oceanic, affinities (Epelidosphaeridia spinosa, Florentinia sp., F. mantellii, \n\nPalaeohystricophora infusorioides: see Harris &amp; Tocher, 2003; Lignum, 2009; Omran et \n\nal., 1990; Pearce, 2000; Peyrot et al., 2011) accords with the preceding indications of \n\na shallow nearshore palaeoenvironment, while simultaneously documenting some \n\nmoderate degree of exposure to open marine influences, consistent with, e.g., a \n\nrestricted tidal influx. \n\nComplementary indications from the other recorded palynomorphs are in line \n\nwith those provided by dinoflagellate cysts. The occurrence of common to abundant \n\nmicroforamineferal linings is taken as an indication of shallow waters (Melia, 1984; \n\nPowell et al., 1990). Classopolis-dominated assemblages of pollen grains, an indicator \n\nof coastal vegetation (Peyrot et al., 2011), along with the scarce representation of \n\nbisaccate pollen, suggest a nearshore deposition, close to the production source. \n\nThe presence of prasinophyte algae also suggests lower salinity of the surface water \n\n(Skupien &amp; Vasicek, 2002), confirmed by the common occurrence of the fresh-water/\n\nbrackish algae Botryoccocus sp. in some samples (Guiry &amp; Guiry, 2017; El Beialy et al., \n\n2010), which may additionally indicate local fluvial influences. \n\nAll taken together, the overall picture provided by the dinocysts-based analysis fits \n\nwell the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the middle Cenomanian of Nazar\u00e9 \n\nbased on the sedimentary and macro-faunal (invertebrate and vertebrate) evidence, \n\nnamely the schematic reconstruction proposed by Callapez et al. (2014), articulating \n\nan idealized tidal flat model and a marginal marine lagoon partially separated from an \n\nopen shelf environment by barrier shoals (see Fig. 29). \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n114\n\nFigure 29 - A. Schematic palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for the Nazar\u00e9 sector during the Midlle \nCenomanian (after Callapez et al., 2014). The lagoonal environment is represented by oyster communities \nwith Gyrostrea ouremensis, illustrated in B. and a vertebrate fauna including fishes, turtles and crocodyliforms.\n\nNevertheless, despite suggestions that these inferred palaeoenvironmental \n\nfeatures may be somewhat reinforced at the top of the succession (e.g., increased \n\ndominance of Subtiliphaera sp., increased representation of taxa with more nearshore \n\naffinities, absence or weakened representation of taxa with more offshore affinities: \n\nsee section 7.3), no clear record of a lower Cenomanian open shelf environment, or \n\nof a transition into the suggested mid-Cenomanian lagoonal system, was obtained. \n\nThis signals a limit of the present study, related to an uneven distribution of the \n\nsamples across the stratigraphic succession. As a result of the criteria guiding the \n\nselection of the most suitable layers for sampling (thin granulometry and darker \n\nsediment: see section 6.1), the lowest sampled layers were actually close to the level \n\nof the LEP/B discontinuity, the accepted boundary between the lower and the \n\nmiddle Cenomanian. Undersampling of the \u201cLevel with Exogyra pseudafricana\u201d strata \n\nmay thus explain the lack of dinocyst-based evidence pointing to an open shelf \n\nenvironment (e.g., a marked increase of stenohaline species and/or the occurrence of \n\nP. infusorioides-dominated assemblages), which may be available at layers lower down \n\nin the succession This issue can only be addressed through future work. In any case, \n\nthe present data suggest that a well developed restricted marginal marine setting was \n\nalready in place at the very beginning of the mid-Cenomanian in the Nazar\u00e9 sector.\n\n\n\nFinal Discussion\n\n115\n\n8.2. BIOSTRATIGRAPHICAL IMPLICATIONS \n\nAnother purported goal of this study was to supplement local biostratigraphic analyses \n\nof the basal section of the carbonate formation (see Callapez, 1998, for a review of \n\nproposed biozonations), with data provided by the dinocysts assemblages. Results \n\nwere rather limited, given the prevalence of species with a long cronostratigraphic \n\nrange. Accepting that Xiphophoridium alatum has its FO during the lower Cenomanian \n\nand Epelidosphaeridia spinosa its LO of at the end of upper Cenomanian (following \n\nWilliams et al., 2004), still below the Cenomanian-Turonian transition, the pattern of \n\noccurrence of these two species in the samples suggests a lower to upper Cenomanian \n\nage of the studied stratigraphic succession (see Fig. 28A and B), The occurrence in \n\nseveral samples, including the lowermost one (M1), of Trithyrodinium suspectum, given \n\nits FO during the upper Cenomanian (following William et al., 2004), suggests a late \n\nCenomanian age for the succession, higher than the early to middle Cenomanian \n\ndating co-indicated by diverse other biostratigraphic markers (Callapez, 1998; \n\nCallapez et al., 2014). Further palynostratrigraphical sampling of the section would be \n\nneeded for a better assessment of the occurrence profile of Trithyrodinium suspectum, \n\nmaking room for the possibility that a revision of its FO in the Late Cretaceous of \n\nIberia might be required. Meanwhile, no other supporting evidence in the literature \n\nsuggests that to be the case. \n\nWhile allowing for a discussion of the overall age range of the succession, no \n\nrelevant contributions for the distinction between Cenomanian substages (lower, \n\nmiddle, upper) came out of the dinocysts analysis. This concurs with the findings \n\nof several other studies where Cenomanian dinocysts assemblages were shown of \n\nlimited value for improving the biostratigraphic resolution at the level of Cenomanian \n\nsubstages (Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler, 1982; Lignum 2009; Peyrot, 2011).\n\n8.3. COMPARATIVE VIEWS WITH OTHER CRETACEOUS \n\nDINOCYSTS ASSEMBLAGES \n\nA further twofold goal of the study was to arrive at an exploratory view of the \n\nsimilarities and differences with dinocysts assemblages at stratigraphically equivalent \n\nregions in Northwest Europe, on the one hand, and at other Tethyan carbonate \n\nplatforms from the Iberian microplate, which during the Late Cretaceous constituted \n\na relatively independent tectonic block with a palaeogeographical location in between \n\n\n\nContribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal\n\n116\n\nthe Protoatlantic and Mediterranean margins (Segura et al., 2014). \n\nThe assemblages found at the Nazar\u00e9 sector reflect a predominance of taxa with \n\na recognized/probable Tethyan affinity, such as Subtilishphaera sp., Florentinia spp., \n\nSpinifirites spp., Xenascus ceratioides (Arai, 2014; Arai et al., 2000; Carvalho et al., 2016; \n\nMasure et al., 2013; Skupien &amp; Vasicek, 2002), and environmental preferences for \n\nwarm water, such as Spiniferites sp., O. pulcherrimum, P. infusiorioides (Prauss, 2002; \n\nUwins &amp; Batten, 1988), while also including species sometimes taken to reflect more \n\nnorthern, Protoatlantic influences, such as Trithyrodinium suspectum (Peyrot, 2011). \n\nUnlike assemblages of the Castilian Platform (Northern-Central Spain), where \n\ncharacteristic high latitude species such as Isabelidinium acuminatum were recorded, no \n\ntaxa with a recognized specific Temperate-Boreal affinity were found at the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nsite.\n\nThe most general result of the comparisons with Cenomanian-Turonian Spanish \n\nassemblages (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011; Peyrot et al., 2012) and with coeval \n\nassemblages from different parts of Northwest Europe (Lignum, 2009), which \n\nnearly all exhibited a predominance of Palaeohystichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites \n\nramosus, was the suggestion of a rather specific local palaeoenvironment of the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nsector during the late early-middle Cenomanian, departing from the widespread \n\nopen shelf marine environments reflected in the studies used for comparison. This \n\npalaeocological specificity of Nazar\u00e9 was further confirmed by comparisons with \n\nearlier studies of Albian-Cenomanian dinocysts in the region of Lisbon (Berthou et \n\nal., 1980; Berthou &amp; Hasenboehler, 1982: see section 7.6) and harmonizes well with \n\nthe suggested role of local tectonics structures (close by diapiric structures of Caldas \n\nda Rainha and S\u00e3o Pedro de Moel acting as barriers) in sustaining the development \n\nof a marginal-marine lagoonal system in early-middle Cenomanian time (Callapez, \n\n1998, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n117\n\nAnderson, D.
