As an\u00e1lises inclu\u00edram: (1) \nbiologia reprodutiva; (2) modelagem da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho e captura por unidade de \nesfor\u00e7o (CPUE) em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos efeitos ambientais e espaciais; (3) movimentos e utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do \nhabitat determinado por telemetria via-sat\u00e9lite e; (4) an\u00e1lise da CPUE de agulh\u00e3o-vela capturado \npela pesca esportiva no Brasil. A propor\u00e7\u00e3o sexual de agulh\u00e3o-vela varia espa\u00e7o-temporalmente \nna \u00e1rea de estudo e o comprimento de primeira matura\u00e7\u00e3o sexual estimado foi 147,21 cm de \nmand\u00edbula inferior at\u00e9 a forquilha (MIF). A fecundidade variou entre 0,44 x 106 ov\u00f3citos \nhidratados para uma f\u00eamea de 156 cm MIF e 2,26 x 106 ov\u00f3citos hidratados para uma f\u00eamea de \n183 cm LJFL. O Atl\u00e2ntico equatorial oeste n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea de desova, enquanto que a costa \nsudeste brasileira, ao contr\u00e1rio, se constitui em uma \u00e1rea de desova importante para a esp\u00e9cie, \nprincipalmente de dezembro a fevereiro. Altas densidades de adultos tamb\u00e9m foram observadas \na oeste de 40\u00b0W, em ambas as partes da \u00e1rea de estudo, norte e sul. Por outro lado, uma \ntend\u00eancia oposta foi observada em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos juvenis, que parecem estar associados a \u00e1guas \ncom temperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar (TSM) superiores a 28\u00b0C com uma profundidade da \ncamada de mistura mais profunda (> 50m), no lado ocidental, particularmente entre 10\u00b0 - 20\u00b0S e \n25\u00b0 - 35\u00b0W. A modelagem da CPUE revelou uma agrega\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal elevada ao longo da costa \nsudeste brasileira durante o pico de desova, enquanto que o centro-oeste do Atl\u00e2ntico, ao sul de ~ \n15\u00b0S, bem como a costa norte brasileira, podem representar importantes \u00e1reas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o \ndurante o inverno. Os modelos tamb\u00e9m revelaram que a TSM e a velocidade do vento foram as \nvari\u00e1veis mais importantes na varia\u00e7\u00e3o da CPUE. Os resultados da telemetria via-sat\u00e9lite \nindicaram um claro padr\u00e3o de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do habitat vertical, predominantemente concentrado \npr\u00f3ximo da superf\u00edcie do mar com uma prefer\u00eancia relativamente estreita de temperatura.  A \n\"rota mais prov\u00e1vel\" sugerem que os agulh\u00f5es-vela marcados n\u00e3o se deslocaram \nsignificativamente do local de marca\u00e7\u00e3o. Por fim, na presente tese, novos insights sobre a \nestrutura populacional da esp\u00e9cie no Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico foram apresentados e discutidos. Embora \na separa\u00e7\u00e3o do estoque do noroeste parece ser clara, ainda h\u00e1 uma grande incerteza sobre o grau \nde mistura entre os estoques do sudoeste e leste. \n\nPalavras-chave: Agulh\u00e3o-vela; \u00e9poca de desova, propor\u00e7\u00e3o sexual, fecundidade, predi\u00e7\u00e3o \nespacial, estrutura de tamanho, padroniza\u00e7\u00e3o de CPUE, telemetria via-sat\u00e9lite, Oceano \nAtl\u00e2ntico \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nAbstract \nIn the present dissertation it was investigated several aspects related to the population dynamics, \necology and fishery of sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic. The analysis \nincluded: (1) reproductive biology; (2) modeling of size distribution and catch rates in relation to \nenvironmental and spatial effects; (3) movements and habitat utilization determined by pop-up \nsatellite tagging and; (4) catch rates of sailfish caught by spot fishery. Sex ratio of sailfish caught \nin the western equatorial south Atlantic varies temporally and spatially and estimate length at \nfirst sexual maturity was 147.21 cm Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL). Batch fecundity estimates \nranged from 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female to 2.26 x 106 hydrated \noocytes for a 183 cm LJFL female. The western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off Brazilian coast is \nnot a spawning ground for sailfish, while the southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be \nan important spawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from \nDecember to February. High densities of adults were also observed to the west of 40oW, both at \nnorthern and southern parts of the studied area. An opposite trend was observed in relation to \njuveniles, which appear to be associated with waters with SSTs higher than 28\u00b0C and deep \nmixed layer (>50m) in the western side, particularly between 10\u00b0 - 20\u00b0S and 25\u00b0 - 35\u00b0W. Catch \nrate predictions revealed a seasonally high aggregation of sailfish off the southeast Brazilian \ncoast during peak spawning while the mid-west Atlantic to the south of ~15\u00b0S as well as the \nBrazilian north coast may represent important  winter feeding grounds. The oceanographic \nmodel revealed that SST and wind velocity were the most important variables describing catch \nrate variation. Regarding pop-up tags, the results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat \nutilization of sailfish, with the majority of the time spent being predominantly concentrated near \nthe sea surface with a relatively narrow temperature range preference. In brief, the \u201cmost \nprobable tracks\u201d suggest that tagged sailfish did not move significantly away from the tagging \nsite. Finally, in the present dissertation, new insights regarding the stock structure of sailfish in \nthe Atlantic Ocean were presented and discussed. Although the separation of the northwest \nsailfish stock seems to be clear, there is still a large uncertainty about the degree of mixing \nbetween southwestern and eastern sailfish.   \n\nKey words: Sailfish, spawning season, sex ratio, fecundity, spatial prediction, catch at size, \ncatch rate standardization, pop-up satellite tagging , Atlantic Ocean.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nAgradecimentos \n\nAloha! agrade\u00e7o primeiramente a Deus por ter me dado sa\u00fade, paz e paci\u00eancia para concluir mais \n\numa etapa da minha vida acad\u00eamica.

Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nO agulh\u00e3o-vela, Istiophorus platypterus, pertencente \u00e0 Ordem Perciformes e \u00e0 \n\nFam\u00edlia Istiophoridae (Nakamura, 1985), possui distribui\u00e7\u00e3o circumglobal, encontrando-se \n\namplamente distribu\u00eddo em \u00e1guas tropicais e temperadas. No oceano Atl\u00e2ntico a esp\u00e9cie ocorre, \n\nbaseado em dados de captura, entre 40\u00b0N a 40\u00b0S, na por\u00e7\u00e3o oeste, e entre 50\u00b0N e 32\u00b0S, na \n\npor\u00e7\u00e3o leste (Ueyagnagi et al., 1970; Ovchinnikov, 1971; Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, \n\n1985). A presen\u00e7a da esp\u00e9cie no Mar Mediterr\u00e2neo tem sido tamb\u00e9m relatada, embora tais \n\nregistros, al\u00e9m de raros, tenham se baseado em esp\u00e9cimes jovens, gerando d\u00favidas a respeito de \n\nsua identifica\u00e7\u00e3o (Nakamura, 1985). \u00c9 uma esp\u00e9cie oce\u00e2nica, epipel\u00e1gica e migradora, sendo \n\ngeralmente encontrada em \u00e1guas quentes acima da termoclina (entre 21 e 28\u00b0C), embora realize \n\nincurs\u00f5es eventuais em \u00e1guas mais profundas (Nakamura, 1985). Apresenta um padr\u00e3o \n\nmigrat\u00f3rio associado ao deslocamento sazonal das isotermas de superf\u00edcie, situando-se \n\nnormalmente em temperaturas acima de 26\u00b0C (Ueyagnagi et al., 1970). \n\nEntre as esp\u00e9cies de peixe de bico, o agulh\u00e3o-vela \u00e9 a que apresenta h\u00e1bitos \n\nmenos oce\u00e2nicos. No Atl\u00e2ntico oeste tropical \u00e9 freq\u00fcentemente encontrado sobre a plataforma \n\ncontinental, sobretudo no Golfo do M\u00e9xico, Mar do Caribe e costa nordeste do Brasil. Embora, \n\nocasionalmente, possa formar cardumes ou pequenos grupos, variando entre tr\u00eas e trinta \n\nindiv\u00edduos, \u00e9 geralmente encontrado isolado, sem formar agrega\u00e7\u00f5es (Beardsley et al., 1975; \n\nNakamura, 1985).  \u00c9 uma esp\u00e9cie heterossexual, n\u00e3o havendo caracter\u00edsticas morfol\u00f3gicas \n\nexternas ou colora\u00e7\u00e3o diferenciada entre machos e f\u00eameas, embora os esp\u00e9cimes maiores \n\nusualmente sejam do sexo feminino. Pode atingir um comprimento m\u00e1ximo de aproximadamente \n\n348 cm e 100 kg de peso, com os machos alcan\u00e7ando a maturidade com 110 cm e as f\u00eameas com \n\n130 cm (Jolley Jr., 1977; Nakamura, 1985).  \n\nO agulh\u00e3o-vela \u00e9 o um dos principais alvos da pesca recreacional e esportiva em \n\ntodo o mundo, sendo uma das esp\u00e9cies mais capturadas por esta pescaria,  devido a sua natureza \n\nmenos oce\u00e2nica entre os peixes de bico. Por outro lado, a pesca oce\u00e2nica com espinhel de \n\nsuperficie direcionada para os atuns e o espadarte, representa o maior impacto sobre os estoques \n\nde agulh\u00e3o-vela ao redor do mundo. Al\u00e9m disso, os estoques da esp\u00e9cie tamb\u00e9m tem sofrido \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nimpacto de pescarias de pequena escala direcionadas ao dourado (Coryphaena Hippurus) no \n\nsudeste do Brasil e no Mar do Caribe. Entre os peixes de bico, o agulh\u00e3o-vela \u00e9 a esp\u00e9cie mais \n\ncapturada e comercializada no Caribe. Em Barbados, por exemplo, a esp\u00e9cie perfaz 73% da \n\ncaptura total de peixes de bico (Mohammed et al. 2003). No Atlantico leste tropical, a esp\u00e9cie \n\ntamb\u00e9m \u00e9 capturada incidentalmente na pesca de cerco europ\u00e9ia (Gaertner et al. 2002) e na pesca \n\nartesanal com redes de emalhar frente a costa de Gana e Senegal (ICCAT, 2009). Sendo assim, \n\nos estoques da esp\u00e9cie v\u00eam sendo submetidos a uma intensa press\u00e3o pesqueira, a qual nas \n\n\u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas se intensificou de forma acentuada, n\u00e3o apenas pelo crescimento da pesca de \n\nespinhel e de pequena escala, mas tamb\u00e9m pela crescente populariza\u00e7\u00e3o da pesca esportiva.  \n\nEm fun\u00e7\u00e3o do seu comportamento altamente migrat\u00f3rio, a esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 capturada por \n\nv\u00e1rios pa\u00edses e diferentes artes de pesca, o que faz com que a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e o manejo de seus \n\nestoques s\u00f3 sejam poss\u00edveis por meio de esfor\u00e7os conjuntos de v\u00e1rias na\u00e7\u00f5es. No caso da pesca \n\nde atuns e afins no Atl\u00e2ntico, a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o respons\u00e1vel pela avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e manejo dos estoques de \n\nagulh\u00f5es \u00e9 a Comiss\u00e3o Internacional para a Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do Atum Atl\u00e2ntico (ICCAT - \n\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), constitu\u00edda atualmente por \n\nquase 48 pa\u00edses. Historicamente a ICCAT tem adotado a hip\u00f3tese da exist\u00eancia de dois estoques \n\ndistintos de agulh\u00e3o-vela (oeste e leste) separados arbitrariamente pelos meridianos associados \u00e0 \n\ncordilheira meso-oce\u00e2nica do Atl\u00e2ntico (40\u00b0 W no Atl\u00e2ntico norte e; 20\u00b0W no Atl\u00e2ntico sul).  \n\nComo os estoques de agulh\u00e3o-vela encontram-se atualmente em n\u00edveis muito baixos de \n\nbiomassa, apresentando sinais claros de sobrepesca, particularmente para o estoque leste, h\u00e1 uma \n\nnecessidade urgente de ado\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas de ordenamento que garantam a sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, as \n\nquais, entretanto, para que sejam efetivas, dependem fortemente da disponibilidade de dados de \n\ncaptura e esfor\u00e7o, al\u00e9m de informa\u00e7\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas, os quais s\u00e3o ainda, infelizmente, bastante \n\nescassos. Al\u00e9m disso, a necessidade de uma melhor defini\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura populacional dos \n\nagulh\u00f5es no \u00e2mbito da ICCAT \u00e9 t\u00e3o grande que desde 1987 vem se desenvolvendo o Programa \n\nde Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Intensiva sobre os Agulh\u00f5es, incluindo trabalhos de marca\u00e7\u00e3o e recaptura, \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o e abund\u00e2ncia, gen\u00e9tica, levantamento das caracter\u00edsticas de seus habitats, de idade e \n\ncrescimento, de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e de biologia reprodutiva.  \n\nSegundo as estat\u00edsticas da ICCAT, a captura de agulh\u00e3o-vela no oceano Atl\u00e2ntico \n\nleste teve um aumento significativo entre as d\u00e9cadas de 50 e 60, passando de 95 t em 1957 para \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n1714 t em 1969. A partir de 1970 a captura continuou a aumentar atingindo o pico em 1976, com \n\n6.250 t, seguido por uma tend\u00eancia decrescente at\u00e9 1981, com 3.050 t. Em 1983 a captura voltou \n\na aumentar, atingindo 4.892 t, passando por um per\u00edodo de decr\u00e9scimo gradativo at\u00e9 1999, \n\nquando alcan\u00e7ou 2.724 t. De 2000 em diante a captura de agulh\u00e3o-vela se estabilizou em \n\naproximadamente 3.000 t/ano. O lado leste do oceano Atl\u00e2ntico sempre foi respons\u00e1vel pela \n\nmaior parcela da captura dessa esp\u00e9cie, sobretudo, entre meados da d\u00e9cada de 70 e o inicio da \n\nd\u00e9cada de 90, quando foram registradas as maiores capturas (m\u00e9dia de ~71% do total capturado \n\nno Atl\u00e2ntico). A partir da d\u00e9cada de 90, a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de ambos os lados do Atl\u00e2ntico se \n\nequilibraram em um patamar semelhante, embora o Atl\u00e2ntico oriental ainda apresente uma \n\nligeira predomin\u00e2ncia nas capturas.  \n\n1.2. Identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do problema abordado na tese \n\nHistoricamente o manejo dos recursos pesqueiros tem sido embasado em modelos \n\nde din\u00e2mica populacional que levam em considera\u00e7\u00e3o apenas as altera\u00e7\u00f5es da abund\u00e2ncia dos \n\nrecursos ao longo do tempo (Hilborn e Walters, 1992). Tais modelos consideram as vari\u00e1veis \n\ndemogr\u00e1ficas (abund\u00e2ncia populacional) e ambientais de forma estacion\u00e1ria e correlacionadas \n\ndentro de uma escala temporal (i.e. m\u00e9dias anuais calculadas para extensas \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas) \n\n(Ciannelli et al., 2008). Entretanto, apesar desses modelos fornecerem sinais de como os \n\nmecanismos denso-dependentes influenciam a din\u00e2mica populacional dos recursos explotados, \n\neles podem, ao mesmo tempo, potencialmente distorcer a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o acerca das intera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre o ambiente e a abund\u00e2ncia dos recursos (Brill e Lutcavage, 2001), j\u00e1 que na maioria dos \n\ncasos, em raz\u00e3o da falta de dados, a variabilidade populacional \u00e9 considerada espacialmente \n\nhomog\u00eanea.  \n\nOs organismos aqu\u00e1ticos, de uma maneira geral, apresentam uma elevada \n\nsensibilidade \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, decorrente de sua maior vulnerabilidade ao \n\nmeio no qual est\u00e3o imersos. Por essa raz\u00e3o, flutua\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais podem retardar ou acelerar, \n\nsignificativamente, a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de um determinado estoque pesqueiro. Al\u00e9m disso, as \n\nmudan\u00e7as no regime ambiental tamb\u00e9m podem determinar per\u00edodos de aumento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nalguns recursos importantes em algumas \u00e1reas e o decl\u00ednio equivalente para outras popula\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\ncom consequ\u00eancias potencialmente negativas para o setor pesqueiro. A constante mudan\u00e7a \n\nespa\u00e7o-temporal do meio ambiente \u00e9 que condiciona a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o das principais esp\u00e9cies de \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\natuns e afins numa determinada \u00e1rea e \u00e9poca do ano, onde as condi\u00e7\u00f5es oceanogr\u00e1ficas s\u00e3o \n\nfavor\u00e1veis \u00e0 reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o ou \u00e0 alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dessas esp\u00e9cies (Fr\u00e9on e Misund, 1999), \n\nprincipalmente de esp\u00e9cies pel\u00e1gicas que realizam grandes migra\u00e7\u00f5es, como \u00e9 o caso do \n\nagulh\u00e3o-vela.  \n\nApesar do impacto das varia\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais sobre a captura e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nrecursos pesqueiros ter sido bastante discutido na arena internacional, em conjun\u00e7\u00e3o com a \n\nnecessidade crescente de se buscar cada vez mais um manejo pesqueiro baseado no ecossistema \n\n(ecosystem-based fisheries management) (Pikitch et al., 2004), estudos sobre o agulh\u00e3o-vela com \n\nessa abordagem no Atl\u00e2ntico sul s\u00e3o particularmente raros. Por exemplo, na costa sudeste e sul \n\ndo Brasil, concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de agulh\u00e3o-vela t\u00eam sido observadas apenas nos meses quentes, entre \n\nsetembro e mar\u00e7o, quando a esp\u00e9cie concentra-se nessa regi\u00e3o para realizar a desova (Arfelli e \n\nAmorim, 1981, Mourato et al., 2009a). Na costa norte e nordeste, o agulh\u00e3o-vela \u00e9 capturado ao \n\nlongo do ano, embora com rendimentos bem menores do que no sudeste e sul do Brasil durante o \n\nver\u00e3o (Mourato et al., 2009a) e com participa\u00e7\u00e3o relativa na produ\u00e7\u00e3o total da frota atuneira \n\nsediada no nordeste, de apenas 1,5%, representando cerca de 13% dos agulh\u00f5es capturados \n\n(Hazin et al., 1994).  \n\nSendo assim, a presente tese visou suprir as lacunas desta \u00e1rea do conhecimento \n\npara o oceano Atl\u00e2ntico sul, estudando-se a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a heterogeneidade espacial das capturas \n\nde agulh\u00e3o-vela e a varia\u00e7\u00e3o das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, de forma a se compreender se elas \n\ninterferem na capturabilidade no espinhel pel\u00e1gico, bem como no ciclo migrat\u00f3rio e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom a \u00e9poca de desova da esp\u00e9cie.  \n\n1.3. Objetivos \n\n1.3.1. Objetivo geral \n\nO objetivo geral deste estudo foi aprofundar os conhecimentos sobre a din\u00e2mica \n\npopulacional do agulh\u00e3o-vela no Atl\u00e2ntico sul, incluindo estudos sobre sua abund\u00e2ncia relativa, \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o, uso do habitat, comportamento e biologia reprodutiva. Para este prop\u00f3sito, \n\nprimeiramente foi abordado os aspectos relativos \u00e0 biologia reprodutiva da esp\u00e9cie, analisando-\n\nse um n\u00famero consider\u00e1vel de amostras com ampla abrang\u00eancia geogr\u00e1fica, o que permitiu \n\nidentificar e delinear com maior precis\u00e3o a \u00e1reas de desova da esp\u00e9cie no Atl\u00e2ntico sudoeste \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nequatorial. Em seguida, foram analisados dados de captura e esfor\u00e7o de pesca, bem como uma \n\ns\u00e9rie temporal de dados de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de frequ\u00eancia de comprimentos em conjun\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\ndiversas vari\u00e1veis ambientais (temperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar, profundidade do topo da \n\ntermoclina, concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de clorofila, etc.) atrav\u00e9s de modelos robustos de regress\u00e3o n\u00e3o-linear. \n\nA partir dessa an\u00e1lise, foi poss\u00edvel identificar os padr\u00f5es de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espa\u00e7o-temporal das \n\ncapturas e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a \u00e9poca de desova da esp\u00e9cie, bem como descrever o padr\u00e3o de \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o e prefer\u00eancias ambientais de indiv\u00edduos adultos e sub-adultos/juvenis no Atl\u00e2ntico \n\nsul. Al\u00e9m disso, objetivando-se identificar com maior precis\u00e3o os movimentos migrat\u00f3rios e \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do habitat da esp\u00e9cie, tamb\u00e9m foi utilizada a metodologia de telemetria via sat\u00e9lite, \n\npor meio das marcas PSAT (Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags). Essa an\u00e1lise possibilitou um melhor \n\nentendimento dos movimentos verticais e sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a vulnerabilidade e capturabilidade da \n\nesp\u00e9cie no espinhel pel\u00e1gico, bem como o tempo de resid\u00eancia em determinadas \u00e1reas e sua \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o com a \u00e9poca de desova da esp\u00e9cie no Atl\u00e2ntico sul. Por fim, foi efetuada uma discuss\u00e3o \n\ngeral sobre os principais resultados obtidos, levando-se em considera\u00e7\u00e3o os aspectos \n\nrelacionados com o manejo pesqueiro da esp\u00e9cie, bem como a estrutura do estoque da esp\u00e9cie no \n\nAtl\u00e2ntico sul. \n\n1.3.2.

Additionally, gonad samples were also obtained from small longliners, based in the \n\nport of Cabo Frio (RJ), located in the southeast coast of Brazil, and from tuna longliners based in \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo State (Santos- SP) (Area 2). All specimens were measured for lower jaw-fork length \n\n(LJFL) and to assign maturity phases, the microscopic characteristics of histological sections, the \n\ndistribution of oocyte diameters and the gonadal index (GI) were considered. A total of 250 \n\nspecimens were examined from Area 1, 168 of which were females, ranging in LJFL from 104 to \n\n210 cm, and 82 were males, ranging from 134 to 185 cm. A total of 375 specimens were \n\nexamined from area 2, 171 of which were females, ranging in LJFL from 122 to 197 cm, and 204 \n\nwere males, from 104 to 197 cm LJFL. The ovaries of 280 females could be classed into six \n\novarian development phases based on microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group \n\nof oocytes. The relationship between the fraction mature and size can be described by a logistic \n\ncurve with lengths at 50% and 95% maturity (LJFL50 and LJFL95) of 147.31 \u00b11.01 cm LJFL \n\n(estimate \u00b1 standard error, SE) and 168.18 \u00b1 1.01 cm LJFL. Batch fecundity estimates ranged \n\nfrom 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female to 2.26 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a \n\n183 cm LJFL female. According to the results, the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off \n\nBrazilian coast (Area 1), is not a spawning ground for sailfish, since most of the specimens were \n\nclassified as immature or developing, with few spawning capable females and the total absence \n\nof actively spawning specimens. The southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be an \n\nimportant spawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from \n\nDecember to February. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, sailfish is widely distributed in subtropical and tropical \n\nwaters and occasionally in temperate waters, occurring also in the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nGeographical limits for its distribution, based on commercial catches, is approximately 40\u00b0N in \n\nthe western North Atlantic, 50\u00b0N in the eastern North Atlantic, 40\u00b0S in the western South \n\nAtlantic, and 32\u00b0S in the eastern South Atlantic (Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). The \n\nimpact of fishing on billfish stocks in the south Atlantic is currently on focus of considerable \n\ninternational concern. Major recreational fisheries for billfishes (Istiophoridae) exist throughout \n\nthe world\u2019s tropical oceans, thus placing them among the most sought-after big gamefish (IGFA, \n\n2001). Besides, although billfishes are not a target species, they are also caught in great numbers \n\nby commercial fisheries, including both industrial, such as the tuna longline fishery, and artisanal \n\n(ICCAT, 2009). \n\nThe first assessment of sailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean was conducted by the \n\nStanding Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of the International Commission for the \n\nConservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009. Conclusions of the assessment indicated \n\nevidences of overfishing, particularly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the results \n\nwere interpreted with considerable caution due to data deficiencies and the resulting uncertainty \n\nin the assessment (ICCAT, 2009). It was clear also that there remains considerable uncertainty \n\nregarding the stock structure of the sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean. These uncertainties linger on \n\nmainly due to the lack of adequate information about catch and effort data, since most countries \n\noften report their fishery statistics to the ICCAT without distinguishing between sailfish and \n\nspearfish and landings data for these two species are usually combined. \n\nFurthermore, the current stock assessment model used to assess population status \n\nof sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean is hampered by the lack of information on life history of this \n\nspecies, such as age, growth and reproductive biology. It is important, for instance, to quantify \n\nthe reproductive potential of sailfish for a better understanding of the population dynamics of this \n\nspecies. In addition, the delineation of spawning grounds is fundamental for the potential \n\nestablishment of time-area closures to protect and ensure the spawning and consequently the \n\nrecruitment of heavily exploited species. Besides, the identification of the spawning grounds, \n\nincluding their degree of spatiotemporal isolation, might help the delineation of different stocks. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nUp to now, the available information on the reproductive biology of sailfish in the \n\nAtlantic Ocean is restricted to gonad assessments and larval surveys, most of which conducted in \n\nthe North Atlantic (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977; de Sylva and Breder 1997; Post et al., 1997; Luthy \n\n2004; Richardson et al., 2009a and b). The available information for the south Atlantic is \n\nrestricted to gonad weights from few individuals caught off the coast of Brazil, according to \n\nwhich the majority of spawning activity takes place off the southeast coast, during summer \n\nmonths (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Hazin et al., 1994). However, detailed information on \n\novarian development, sex ratio, size at maturity, fecundity or spawning is not yet available.  \n\nIn this context, the general goal of the present chapter was to examine the \n\nreproductive dynamics of sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean in order to \n\nprovide life history information useful for stock assessment, including the spatial and temporal \n\nvariation in reproductive activity, based on histological analysis of gonads and gonad weight \n\nindices. Reproductive parameters estimated included: length/season/region-specific sex-ratios, \n\nsize at maturity, batch fecundity and spawning frequency.  \n\n2.2. Material and Methods \n\n2.2.1. Sample collection and area of study \n\nThe biological samples examined in the present study were collected by observers \n\nof the National Observer Program of the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture, from \n\n2006 to 2009, on board of tuna longliners based in the ports of Natal (RN) and Cabedelo (PB), \n\nlocated in northeast coast of Brazil. Additionally, gonad samples were also obtained from small \n\nlongliners, based in the port of Cabo Frio (RJ), located in the southeast coast of Brazil, and from \n\ntuna longliners based in S\u00e3o Paulo State (Santos- SP) (Figure 2.1). In order to evaluate the spatial \n\nvariability of the reproductive activity, the analysis was conducted in two separate areas: a) Area \n\n1, for samples obtained from longliners based in Northeast Brazil, which operated in the \n\nequatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean; and b) Area 2, for those collected from vessels \n\nbased in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, operating off the southeast coast of Brazil (Figure 2.1). \n\nAll specimens were measured for lower jaw-fork length (LJFL), being then dissected for the \n\ncollection of gonads, which were then frozen and stored in freezers, up to the time of landing. \n\nSex was initially determined from the macroscopic characteristics of the gonads. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Assessing the reproductive activity \n\nIn the laboratory, the gonads were thawed, individually weighted (\u00b10.1 g) and \n\nmeasured for the total length and width. A sub-sample was kept in 10% neutral formalin solution \n\nfor posterior microscopic analysis. To assign maturity phases to the examined specimens, the \n\nmicroscopic characteristics of histological sections, the distribution of oocyte diameters and the \n\ngonadal index (GI) were considered (West, 1990; Arocha, 2002; Brown-Peterson et al., 2011). \n\nHistological sections were prepared from gonad tissue samples embedded in \n\nparaffin, sectioned at approximately 5\u00b5m, and stained with Harris\u2019s haematoxylin and eosin. \n\nHistological examination assisted the field-classified sex, especially for small specimens. Each \n\novary was staged according to the microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group of \n\noocytes (MAGO) present in the sample, including:  primary growth oocytes, cortical alveolar, \n\nvitellogenic oocytes, germinal vesicle migration or hydrated. Post-ovulatory follicles (Hunter et \n\nal. 1985; Murua et al., 2003) were identified and atresia of vitellogenic oocytes was recorded to \n\naid in the determination of the reproductive condition. Additionally, to confirm that the sailfish is \n\na multiple spawner, the frequency distribution of diameter of approximately 300 oocytes from \n\neleven females with gonads with hydrated oocytes (actively spawning females) was analyzed. \n\nThe diameters (mm) of whole oocytes were obtained randomly from each female, with the \n\nassistance of a stereomicroscope with a micrometer. \n\nThe sex ratio was analyzed by month and LJFL, with the statistical significance of \n\nthe differences being tested by the chi-square test (?2, ?=0.05). After assigning the maturity \n\nstages, the monthly mean GI was estimated for adult specimens (excluding the immature \n\nspecimens), for determination of spawning period. The GI was calculated based on Cayr\u00e9 and \n\nLalo\u00e9 (1986), as follows: 43 10??\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n=\nLJFL\nGW\n\nGI , where GW is gonad weight (g).  \n\n2.2.3. Reproductive parameters population \n\nThe length at which 50% of all individuals were sexually mature (L50) was \n\nestimated only from specimens caught during the spawning season and from the spawning area. \n\nFemales were defined as mature if they presented cotical alveolar, vitellogenic oocytes, germinal \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nvesicle migration, or hydrated oocytes. The probability that the ith fish was mature (Pi) was \n\nmodeled using a logistic curve, described by Sun et al. (2009), as: \n\n( ) ( )[ ]( )955050)19ln(11 LJFLLJFLLJFLLJFLi ieP ???+= , \nwhere LJFLi = the LJFL of fish i; and LJFL50 and  LJFL95 = the LJFLs at which \n\n50% and 95% of the specimens reached maturity, respectively. LJFL50 and LJFL95 were \n\nestimated by maximizing a log-likelihood function, and by assuming a binomial error \n\ndistribution, with R software. \n\nBatch fecundity (BF) was estimated gravimetrically by the hydrated oocyte \n\nmethod using fixed ovarian samples, which contained hydrated oocytes. Three subsamples (1.0 \n\ng) were taken from each ovary, teased apart to release the oocytes, and washed thoroughly to \n\nrelease the hydrated oocytes. BF was then back-calculated by the product of gonad weight and \n\noocyte density, where oocyte density was the mean number of oocytes per gram of three ovarian \n\ntissues with no early postovulatory follicles (Hunter et al., 1985). Regression analyses were \n\nconducted to quantify the relationships between batch fecundity and LJFL. \n\n2.2.4. Spawning pattern and annual fecundity  \n\nThe spawning interval was estimated by the hydrated oocyte method (Hunter and \n\nMacewicz, 1985) and was restricted to samples collected in the Area 2 during the peak spawning \n\nseason (Arocha and Barrios, 2009), from December to February. The spawning interval (in days) \n\nwas calculated by dividing the total number of mature females for all years combined by the \n\nnumber of actively spawning females. For the hydrated oocyte method to be a useful proxy for \n\nspawning frequency two assumptions were considered. The first was whether or not spawning \n\noccurs in the evening and the second was whether the spawning area represents a closed \n\npopulation (Arocha and Barrios, 2009). Annual fecundity was estimated as the product of \n\naverage batch fecundity, the spawning fraction, and the duration of the spawning season.  \n\n2.3. Results \n\n2.3.1. Size composition and sex ratio \n\nArea 1  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nA total of 250 specimens were examined from Area 1, 168 of which were females, \n\nranging in LJFL from 104 to 210 cm (Figure 2.2), and 82 were males, ranging from 134 to 185 \n\ncm (Figure 2.2). Most of the females measured from 160 to 190 cm LJFL, with a mode in 170 \n\ncm, while most of the males showed a LJFL between 150 and 170 cm, with a mode at 160cm. \n\nThe overall sex ratio was 2.04 females to 1 male, which differed significantly (?2 =29.584; p &lt;\n\n0.05) from the expected proportion of 1:1. Females predominated in almost all months, except \n\nfor May, but only in September and October the difference was statistically significant (Table \n\n2.1, Figure 2.3). An apparent predominance of females was observed in all size classes (Figure \n\n2.4), but only in LJFL larger than 160 cm the differences were statistically significant (Table \n\n2.2).  \n\nArea 2  \n\nA total of 375 specimens were examined from area 2, 171 of which were females, \n\nranging in LJFL from 122 to 197 cm (Figure 2.2), and 204 were males, from 104 to 197 cm \n\nLJFL (Figure 2.2). The LJFL frequency distribution of females showed a higher frequency of \n\nspecimens between 150 and 180 cm, with a mode in 160 cm. For males, the LJFL frequency \n\ndistribution showed a mode in 160 cm, with most specimens ranging from 150 to 170 cm. The \n\nestimated sex ratio for all samples was 0.84 female to 1 male, which not differed significantly \n\nfrom the expected proportion of 1:1. The monthly sex ratios were not significantly different from \n\nthe expected ratio of 1:1 (p>0.05) for any month (Table 2.1). A slight predominance of males \n\nwas however observed (Figure 2.3). The sex ratio by size also showed a predominance of males \n\nin almost all size classes, except for 160 and 190 cm LJFL classes which not differed \n\nsignificantly (p &lt;0.05) from the expected proportion of 1:1 (Table 2.2, Figure 2.4). \n\n2.3.2. Ovary development and spawning season  \n\nThe ovaries of 280 females could be classed into six ovarian development phases \n\nbased on microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group of oocytes (Table 2.3, Figure \n\n2.5). The gonad weight of the females classified as immature ranged from 32 to 180g (Figure \n\n2.6). The LJFL of immature females ranged between 104 and 173 cm. Developing females, in \n\nturn, had a LJFL between 136 and 210 cm and GW from 51 to 1334g. Spawning capable females \n\nhad a LJFL between 146 and 197 cm with a GW ranging from 250 to 2,752g. Actively spawning \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nfemales, with a LJFL between 156 and 194 cm, had a GW from 700 to 2,105g. Regressing \n\nfemales presented a LJFL between 159 and 181 cm, with a GW ranging from 163 to 1,195g \n\n(Figure 2.6). Recovering females had a LJFL between 157 and 210 cm and GW from 93 to 355g. \n\nActively spawning females were absent in Area 1, and only 2% of the females in \n\nthis area were in the spawning capable phase. The great majority of the specimens analyzed were \n\nin developing phase (57%). Immature and recovering phases accounted, respectively, for 22% \n\nand 17%. In contrast, in area 2, most of the specimens were spawning capable or actively \n\nspawning, representing, respectively, 42% and 14% of the sample. In Area 1, females with \n\ndeveloping ovaries occurred in all sampled months, while immature females were more frequent \n\nin January and February (Figure 2.7). In area 2, females with spawning capable or regressing \n\novaries were more frequent from December to February while the proportion of immature and \n\ndeveloping females was very low (Figure 2.7). The monthly GI showed higher mean values in \n\nArea 2, from December to February (close or more than two) (Figure 2.8). In contrast, the \n\nmonthly mean GI in Area 1 presented much smaller values, being always less than one (Figure \n\n2.8). \n\n2.3.3. Spawning pattern  \n\n The smallest group had oocytes smaller than 0.4 mm, composed by primary growth \n\noocytes, cortical alveolar, primary and secondary vitellogenic oocytes oocytes (Figure 2.10). The \n\nnext larger group was composed of tertiary vitellogenic oocytes, ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 mm \n\n(Figure 2.10). The third group was the largest and corresponded to the germinal vesicle \n\nmigration oocytes, germinal vesicle breakdown oocytes and hydrated oocytes, measuring 0.8-1.6 \n\nmm (Figure 2.10). During the peak of the spawning season (December to February), an average \n\nof 22% of the actively spawning females was spawning daily which indicates that the average \n\ninterval between spawning and a new batch of eggs is around 4.4 days. \n\n2.3.4. Length at first sexual maturity and batch fecundity \n\nThe relationship between the fraction mature and size can be described by a \n\nlogistic curve with lengths at 50% and 95% maturity (LJFL50 and LJFL95) of 147.21 \u00b11.01 cm \n\nLJFL (estimate \u00b1 standard error, SE) and 168.18 \u00b1 1.01 cm LJFL (Figure 2.11Figure 2.11), \n\nrespectively. The logistic regression was (Figure 2.11):  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n( ) ( )[ ]( )18.16831.14731.147)19ln(11 ???+= iLJFLi eP  (Pseudo-R2 = 0.77, n= 222, 5 \ncm classes). \n\nOnly 15 of the actively spawning females fit the criteria for estimating batch \n\nfecundity (BF) (hydrated oocytes present, without early postovulatory follicles). The LJFLs of \n\nthese individuals ranged from 155 to 183 cm, and their gonad weights ranged from 548 to 2,752 \n\ng. Batch fecundity  estimates ranged from 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female \n\nto 2.26 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 183 cm LJFL female (Figure 2.12). The regression equation \n\nwas: BF = 9.026E-13 * LJFL8.122 (n= 15, pseudo-R2 = 0.62). The annual fecundity was estimated \n\nto range between 9 and 46 million eggs (average of 21 million). \n\n2.4. Discussion \n\n2.4.1. Size distribution and sex ratio \n\nSex ratio of sailfish caught in the western equatorial south Atlantic varies \n\ntemporally and spatially. We observed a general predominance of females in western equatorial \n\nAtlantic along the year while the opposite was noticed in the southeast Brazilian coast during the \n\nspawning season, in warmer months. The predominance of males may be consistent with sexual \n\ndifferences in migratory or reproductive behaviors, such as the greater propensity for males to \n\naggregate in group-spawning pelagic species (Hunter and Macewicz, 1986). Around Florida, for \n\nexample, sailfish is known to moves inshore, into shallow waters, where the females, swimming \n\nsluggishly with their dorsal fins extended and accompanied each by one or more males, may \n\nspawn near the surface, during the warm season (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977). Moreover, temporal \n\nchanges in sex ratios may partly reflect different availabilities or catchabilities resulting from \n\nsexual differences in behavior that change seasonally (e.g. during spawning periods).  Similar \n\nresults were also observed by Chiang et al. (2006a) in the eastern Taiwan, but they differ from \n\nthe findings by Hernandez and Ramirez (1998) for the sailfish in the Pacific Coast of Mexico, \n\nwhere the proportion of female sailfish was higher than 50%. \n\n2.4.2. Ovarian development and spawning season \n\nThe histological analysis of the ovaries and the method of most advanced group of \n\noocytes, used to develop a maturity classification scheme for female sailfish in this study, \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nallowed a more precise identification of maturity phases than the traditional macroscopic \n\ntechniques (i.e. Mourato et al. 2009). Histological studies provide very precise information on \n\noocyte development, although their interpretation may be confused because different authors use \n\ndifferent terminology for the same structures (West, 1990). Previous studies on histology-based \n\nmaturity classifications for sailfish have identified five (Jolley 1977; Hernandez and Ramirez, \n\n1998) to seven different reproductive stages (De Sylvia and Breder, 1998; Chiang et al., 2006a). \n\nDifferences in histological staging classification, especially for highly migratory species, make it \n\ndifficult to compare reproductive parameters between studies in different regions of the world. In \n\nthis study, we adopted a standardized terminology for describing reproductive development in \n\nfishes suggested by Brown-Peterson et al. (2011) which is applied for majority of determinate \n\nand indeterminate spawner fishes. The use of histology to assign the stages of ovary maturation \n\npermitted a clear differentiation of six different phases of maturity, which showed similar oocyte \n\nmicroscopic characteristics as those observed by Chiang et al. (2006a), for Pacific sailfish in \n\nTaiwanese waters.  \n\nSpawning season and areas for the Atlantic sailfish were defined and identified by \n\nthe combination of several methods, including: (1) the identification of actively spawning \n\nfemales with the use of histology analysis; (2) high GSI values; and (3) the position where \n\nactively spawning females were caught. According to the results shown in the present study, the \n\nequatorial and western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off Brazilian coast (Area 1), is not a spawning \n\nground for sailfish, since most of the specimens were classified as immature and developing, , \n\nwith few spawning capable females and the total absence of actively spawning specimens. This \n\nis also supported by the low values of gonad index, when compared to the fish caught off \n\nsouthern Brazil (Area 2). The southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be an important \n\nspawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from December to \n\nFebruary. The vast majority of females caught in this area, during this period of the year, were \n\neither spawning capable or actively spawning, with high values of gonad indices. Important \n\nconcentrations of mature specimens in this area were previously reported by various authors \n\n(Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et al., 2009; Pimenta et al., 2005).  \n\nThe presence of different batches of growing oocytes, including hydrated eggs in \n\nthe oocyte size-frequency distribution and the presence of different generations of oocytes in \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nhistological sections of spawning capable females, suggests that sailfish in the study area (Area \n\n2) can spawn more than once during a spawning season. Morover, assynchronous oocyte \n\ndevelopment was observed due to presence of all types of oocyte stage (previtellogenic and \n\nvitellogenic oocytes) in sections of ovaries, and mainly in spawning capable and actively \n\nspawning females. The presence of post-ovulatory follicles (recent spawned less than 24 hs) and \n\nhydrated oocytes (imminent spawning less than 12 hs) simultaneously in histological section of \n\novaries from females in actively spawning phase is an evidence of multiple spawning behavior. \n\nSimilar findings were also reported by several authors in different regions of the world (Jolley, \n\n1977; Hernandez et al., 2000; Chiang et al., 2006b).  \n\n2.4.3. Reproductive population parameters  \n\nThe LJFL50 for female sailfish was estimated at 147.31 cm, and the smallest size \n\nat which any female was mature was 136.0 cm LJFL. In general, there is a lack of exhaustive \n\nstudies on sailfish sexual maturity. Prior reported estimates of body size at sexual maturity for \n\nfemale sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean in general agree with the estimates of the present study, but \n\ndissimilarities likely reflect the different measures used to gauge sexual maturity used in other \n\nworks. A first attempt to estimate the L50 of sailfish in South Atlantic was reported by Mourato et \n\nal (2009), obtaining a LJFL of the 154.9 cm, based on macroscopic assessment of gonads.  Jolley \n\n(1977) reported that female sailfish caught in the western North Atlantic attains sexual maturity \n\nbetween 147 and 160 cm LJFL (13 to 18 kg). Arocha and Marcano (2006) reported an L50 for \n\nfemales sailfish caught between 5\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N in western North Atlantic of 180.2cm LJFL, but \n\nthe analysis were derived from macroscopic and microscopic assessment of gonads without \n\nhistological calibration. Probably the estimate of L50 reported by Arocha and Marcano (2006) \n\nhave included fish of relatively bigger size caught off Caribbean waters, as well as a lower \n\nnumber of immature fish, which may have deviated the size at maturity upwards.  \n\nThe present estimates of L50 for female sailfish caught by Brazilian longliners are \n\nalso smaller than those of sailfish caught in several regions of the Pacific. In the Mexican Pacific \n\ncoast, Hernandez and Ramirez (1998) estimated that 50% of the females mature at 175 cm EOFL \n\n(eye-orbit fork length) (198.5 cm LJFL), based on histological analysis of gonads. In the western \n\nPacific, Chiang et al. (2006a) reported a L50 of 167 cm LJFL, also based on histological \n\nexamination.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nThe difference between the present results and the other studies cited above might \n\nbe a combined result of different stocks, different environmental conditions, or sampling bias \n\nresulting from sample size and timing, i.e. whether estimates include fish caught throughout the \n\nentire year and fisheries range or during spawning season and area only, such as in the present \n\ncase. The different fisheries strategies are also a likely source of variation, due the non-selective \n\nnature of fishing gears. \n\nIn the present study, the power regression function provided a good relationship \n\nbetween batch fecundity with LJFL, with fecundity increasing with female size. Several authors \n\nhave reported similar results, with fecundity increasing with the size of the sailfish, from eastern \n\nAfrica (Merret, 1970), eastern Pacific (Hernandez et al., 2000), western Pacific (Chiang et al., \n\n2006b), and northwest Atlantic (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977). Despite the length range of spawned \n\nfemales collected in this study (155-183 cm LJFL) was slightly smaller to that reported by \n\nstudies done in the Pacific Ocean, the batch fecundity estimated in the present work (0.44-2.26 x \n\n106) had a similar range from those reported by Hernandez-Herrera et al. (2000) (0.42-2.52 x \n\n106) and by Chiang et al. (2006b) (0.2-2.48 x 106), for Pacific sailfish. However, it differed \n\nslightly from the estimates (0.75-1.6 x 106) observed by Jolley (1977) for the Atlantic.  \n\nThis study presents the first attempt to estimate important parameters (i.e. size at \n\nmaturity, fecundity) of the sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic, which can be \n\nuseful for future stock assessments of the species in the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, the results \n\npresented here seem to confirm the hypothesis that sailfish spawning in the equatorial and \n\nsouthwestern Atlantic is rather limited both geographically and temporally, being greatly \n\nrestricted to the southeast coast of Brazil, between November and February, with the peak of the \n\nspawning season happening in January. Further studies are however still needed, including \n\ntagging experiments, in order to better understand the reproductive cycle of the sailfish in the \n\nSouth Atlantic, and particularly how it is coupled with seasonal migratory movements performed \n\nby the species. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Sex ratio, ?2 and p value from chi-squared test by area and month of sailfish \ncaught in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 - Sex ratio, ?2 and p value from chi-squared test by area and size class of sailfish \ncaught in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean. \n\nLJFL class Area 1 Area 2 \nSex Ratio ?2 p(chi) Sex Ratio ?2 p(chi) \n\n100 - - - - - - \n110 - - - - - - \n120 - - - 0.5 0.8 0.3657 \n130 1.5 0.2 0.6547 0.4 1.6 0.2059 \n140 1.3 0.1 0.7 0.3 3 0.0832 \n150 1.1 0.1 0.715 0.5 8.1 0.0043 \n160 1.1 0.1 0.7456 0.6 7.2 0.0071 \n170 1.9 8.2 0.0040 1.8 9 0.0027 \n180 2.4 5.4 0.0195 4.6 7.1 0.0076 \n190 - - - 4 1.8 0.1797 \n200 - - - - - - \n210 - - - - - - \n\n \n\n \n\nMonth Area 1 Area 2 \nSex Ratio ?2 p(chi) Sex Ratio ?2 p(chi) \n\nJan 3 2 0.1573 0.68 3.1 0.0747 \nFeb 3 3 0.0832 0.75 0.5 0.4497 \nMar 2.2 2.2 0.1336 - - - \nApr 0.7 0.2 0.5930 - - - \nMay 1.6 0.5 0.4795 - - - \nJun 1.6 1 0.3173 - - - \nJul 2.6 3.5 0.0593 - - - \n\nAug 1.4 0.7 0.3938 0.5 0.6 0.4142 \nSep 3.7 14.5 0.0001 - - - \nOct 2.1 4.5 0.0325 - - - \nNov 1.5 1.2 0.2733 0.76 1.8 0.1698 \nDec 2.2 3.8 0.0498 1.12 0.4 0.5211 \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 - Maturity classification of female sailfish ovaries from samples collected from \nthe southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean.

A total of 9,954 Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL) size data (7,541 fish \n\ncaught by longline and 2,413 by gillnet) from the International Commission for the Conservation \n\nof Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) database, were analyzed from 1998 to 2007. Four main \n\nenvironmental variables were considered: sea surface temperature, depth of mixed layer, \n\nchlorophyll concentration and bathymetry. Results indicated that adults were more frequent to \n\nthe east of 25\u00b0W in areas with shallow mixed layer (<30m) between 3000 and 6000 m depth with \n\nSSTs lower than 24\u00b0C. Chlorophyll concentration showed the highest proportion of adults \n\nbetween 0.3 and 0.8 mg/m3. High densities of adults were also observed to the west of 40oW, \n\nboth at northern and southern parts of the studied area. An opposite trend was observed in \n\nrelation to juveniles, which appear to be associated with waters with SSTs higher than 28\u00b0C and \n\ndeep mixed layer (>50m) in the western side, particularly between 10\u00b0 - 20\u00b0S and 25\u00b0 - 35\u00b0W. \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nSailfish, Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw and Nodder, 1791), is an important \n\ncommercial and recreational fisheries resource, being exploited throughout all tropical and \n\nsubtropical oceans. Sailfish has been recognized by some authors as comprising Atlantic and \n\nIndo-Pacific species (Nakamura, 1985). However, genetic data are consistent with the existence \n\nof a single species (Finnerty and Block, 1995; Graves, 1998) with a worldwide distribution \n\n(Beardsley et al. 1975) and, therefore, the sailfish, together with the blue marlin (Makaira \n\nnigricans), are the only pandemic istiophorid billfishes (Nakamura, 1985). Due to its highly \n\nmigratory nature, it is fished by several nations with different fishing gears. Consequently, \n\ninternational management is required, which in the Atlantic Ocean, comes under the jurisdiction \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nof the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Fishing \n\nimpacts on Atlantic billfish stocks is currently the focus of considerable international concern. \n\nBycatch fishing mortality in pelagic longline fisheries, targeting tunas and swordfish, represents \n\none of the main impacts on billfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean (Uozomi, 2003). In the eastern \n\ntropical Atlantic, a large amount of billfishes are also caught as bycatch in European purse-seine \n\nfisheries (Gaertner et al., 2002), and by artisanal fisheries, such as the canoe fishery, in Ghana \n\n(ICCAT, 2009). In addition, billfishes are also a very important resource for various coastal and \n\nartisanal fisheries in the Caribbean, as well as for recreational fisheries, mainly in USA, \n\nVenezuela, Brazil and several Caribbean countries (Peel et al., 2003). In the most recent sailfish \n\nassessment, using data up to 2008, results indicated a decline in biomass of the sailfish stocks, \n\nparticularly for the east Atlantic. However, the analyses in this assessment were severely \n\nhampered by an acute lack of accurate data (ICCAT, 2009). One of the main requirements for a \n\nproper assessment of stock condition is an understanding of its geographic stock structure and \n\nidentification of the main areas of occurrence of different size classes, as well as the influence of \n\nenvironmental factors on distribution.  \n\nSize frequency data from the commercial longline fishery have always been an \n\nimportant information for understanding the changes in the age structure of the stocks and the \n\nseasonal variability in the distribution of tunas and tuna-like species in relation to environmental \n\nand spatial factors. A number of methods have been applied to investigate the fishery \n\noceanography of pelagic species. These include generalized linear models (GLM), habitat based \n\nmodels, generalized additive models (GAM), regression tree models and Geographic Information \n\nSystems (GIS) (Swartzman et al., 1992, Hinton and Nakano, 1996, Zheng et al., 2004, Valavanis \n\net al., 2004, Venables and Ditchmond, 2004, Maunder and Punt, 2004, Valavanis et al., 2008). \n\nAnother approach is the employment of spatial prediction techniques based on interpolation \n\nalgorithms (e.g. kriging), which are generally highly data intensive, requiring large amounts of \n\nwell distributed data. This requirement is rarely attainable by fisheries data, especially when the \n\nstudied species is not the main target of the fishery, such as it is commonly the case for billfishes \n\n(Ortiz and Arocha, 2004). \n\nRecently, a new method based on statistical models for spatial prediction has been \n\ndeveloped, called GRASP (Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction). This \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nmethod uses statistical relationships between response (i.e. species distribution) and \n\nenvironmental variables to model spatial prediction by means of prediction maps (Lehmann et al. \n\n2002).  \n\nIn the GRASP approach, GAM models are used to fit the response variables to the \n\nenvironmental explanatory variables using a non-parametric smoothing function (Hastie and \n\nTibshirani, 1990). The GRASP approach has been proved to be suitable for fisheries resources. It \n\nwas initially applied in the South Atlantic Ocean to model the spatial distribution of swordfish \n\n(Xiphias gladius), using data from Brazilian commercial longline fisheries (Hazin and Erzini, \n\n2008). In the present paper, GRASP was applied to size data of sailfish caught by longline and \n\ngillnet fisheries obtained from ICCAT data record to better understand the relationship between \n\nsize distribution and spatial and environmental factors. \n\n3.2. Material and methods \n\n3.2.1. Size data \n\nData on length frequency distribution (Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL) in cm) \n\nwere obtained from the ICCAT Data Record on fish caught by longline and gillnet fisheries \n\noperating in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic. The data were grouped in 5\u00b0x5\u00b0 stratum \n\nconsidering the initial position of the fishing operation, by month, year, latitude and longitude, \n\nfrom 1998 to 2007. A total of 9,954 LJFL data were utilized, of which 7,541 were from catches \n\nof longline fleets based in Brazil, Venezuela and Spain, and 2,413 were from catches of gillnet \n\nfisheries based in C\u00f4te D\u2019 Ivoire, Ghana and Venezuela. The spatial distribution and density of \n\nthese data are show in Figure 3.1. To evaluate the spatial distribution by length, two LJFL size \n\nclasses were established following procedures described by Jolley (1977) and Mourato et al., \n\n(2009a) as follows: (a)&lt;155 cm, immature individuals (or juveniles), (b) >155 cm, mature \n\nindividuals (or adults). These data were transformed into proportion of juveniles and adults, by \n\n5o square, assuming a binomial distribution.  \n\n3.2.2. Environmental data \n\nA time-series of sea surface temperature (SST) and mixed layer depth (DML) \n\nwere obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC) - \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA (1998\u20132007).  The bathymetry (BATH) at the location of the \n\nfishing sets (BATH) was obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center (ETOPO5 - Earth \n\nTopography 5 min). Chlorophyll-? concentration (CHO) were obtained from SeaWiFS images, \n\nprovided by \u201cSeaWiFS Project\u201d from Goddard Space Flight Center/NASA. These images were \n\nturned into numerical data (in mg/m3) with the GDRA2XYZ program provided by the Phoenix \n\nTraining Consultants. These data, with an original resolution of 0.5\u00b0 (except Chlorophyll- ? \n\nconcentration, which had a initial resolution of 9 km resolution), were used to construct a \n\ndatabase of 5\u00b0\u00d75\u00b0 resolution, by month, year, latitude and longitude. These data were then \n\nmatched with the length frequency data.  \n\n3.2.3. Modeling \n\nThe spatial prediction of the proportion of adult individuals (PR) as a function of \n\nenvironmental and spatial variables was modeled using GRASP v3.2 (Lehmann et al., 2002). In \n\nthe GRASP approach, the spatial predictions are obtained by the relationships between a \n\nresponse variable (proportion of individuals at adult stage) and selected predictor variables \n\n(environmental and spatial variables) by the fitting of a GAM model. The general formulation of \n\nthe GAM is expressed in the following manner: \n\nPR = a + s1(x1) + sj(xj) . . . + e \n\nwhere PR is the proportion of adults, a is a constant, s1 is the effect of the \n\nsmoothing function for the independent variable x1 and e is the random error of the function. The \n\nnon-linear effects of the model were adjusted by smoothing \u201cSpline\u201d functions (natural cubic) \n\nwith four degrees of freedom. The choice of the degrees of freedom was based on visual \n\ninspection and exploratory analysis. Such approach allows the detection of major effects and \n\nreduces spurious patterns that can arise from overfitting (Maravelias et al., 2000). The binomial \n\ndistribution was used with a logit link function. Due to a spatial distribution discontinuity of the \n\nLJFL classes, the analysis was restricted to the delimited area shown in the Figure 3.1. This is \n\nnecessary due to the decreased predictive capacity of the models in areas with low density of \n\ndata. \n\nThe consistency of the final model was evaluated using: 1) linear regression \n\nbetween randomly chosen observed values of proportion of adults and those generated by the \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nmodel using the included independent variables as input (simple validation) and 2) a cross-\n\nvalidation method which assessed the goodness of fit of the model. The correlation between the \n\nobserved and predicted values was estimated by the Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the \n\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) test was used for the binomial model. ROC indicates \n\nmodel performance, independently of the apparently arbitrary probability threshold required in \n\nthe proportion models, at which the presence of a target feature is accepted (Fielding and Bell, \n\n1997). A total of 5,000 lengths were randomly chosen from the length frequency data set \n\n(besides the 9,954 measurements used in the model). These were used for the exclusive purpose \n\nof cross validation, and therefore were not included in the model. Predictors were selected using \n\na forward and backward stepwise procedure, going in both directions from a full model and \n\nremoving predictors according to an F-test (?= 0.05).The relative effect of each xj variable over \n\nthe dependent variable (here the proportion of adults) was evaluated using the distribution of \n\npartial residuals.  \n\n3.3. Results \n\nThe final model explained 52.8% of the total variance, including latitude, \n\nlongitude, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-? concentration, depth of mixed layer and \n\nbathymetry as continuous variables and month as a factor. The relative contribution for each \n\nvariable in the total explained variance (52.8%) for the selected model shows that longitude \n\neffect was the most significant factor in the analysis. Among the environmental variables, the \n\ndepth of mixed layer was the most important, followed by chlorophyll-? concentration, sea \n\nsurface temperature and bathymetry (Figure 3.2). The results of the simple and cross-validations \n\nof the final model are also shown in the table 1. The ROC values (validation and cross-\n\nvalidation, 0.78, 0.81, respectively) indicate that predictions were reasonably fitted and matched \n\nwell with the data.  \n\nThere was an increase in the proportion of adults to 0.3 mg/m3 of chlorophyll-? \n\nconcentration, then rather stable at higher concentrations (Figure 3.3). The effect of bathymetry \n\nindicated that adult sailfish were more abundant than juveniles when depths exceeded 4,000 m. \n\nAdult sailfish were also more abundant in areas when depth of the mixed layer was less than 20 \n\nm and in waters with SST was&lt;24\u00b0C (Figure 3.3). The proportion of adults was highest in \n\nMarch and September (Figure 3.3). \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nSpatial prediction (Figure 3.4) shows that adult sailfish were more frequent to the \n\nwest of 40oW, both at northern and southern parts of the studied area, as well as to the east of \n\n25oW. Along the Brazilian coast, from 25oW to 40oW, the proportion of adults was very low in \n\nparticular from 10oS to 25oS (Figure 3.4).     \n\n3.4. Discussion \n\nA proper understanding of essential fish habitats has been considered crucial to \n\nthe development of fishery management strategies based on an ecosystem approach (Valavanis et \n\nal., 2004). In this study, the GRASP tool was used to describe the preferential habitats of sailfish, \n\nin relation to juveniles and adults, based on size distribution, environmental and spatial data. \n\nThere have been many applications of GRASP, including use with terrestrial animals (Fraser et \n\nal., 2005), plants (Lehmann et al., 2002; Zerger et al., 2009), seagrass (Bekkby et al., 2008) and \n\ncoral reefs (Garza-P\u00e9rez et al., 2004).  \n\nAlthough the spatial factor longitude provided the highest explanatory ability on \n\nthe proportion of adults of sailfish, the environmental effects were also significant. The inclusion \n\nof environmental variables in the analysis often resulted in low levels of explanation, because \n\nfishing and environmental data were generally not obtained simultaneously (Brill and Lutcavage, \n\n2001) and relationships are not well described on scales of 5\u00b0- month data. Conversely, many \n\nspecies, in particular the highly migratory, have a life cycle strictly related to environmental \n\nconditions that affect their availability and vulnerability (Fr\u00e9on and Misund, 1999). Thus, the \n\ninclusion of environmental variables in the model is relevant for an appropriate understanding of \n\nthe distribution of sailfish in the South Atlantic Ocean.  \n\nThe much higher proportion of adults east of 25oW, agrees with Beardsley (1980) \n\nand Prince and Goodyear (2006), who also indicated that the largest sailfish are located on the \n\neastern side of the Atlantic. Data on size distribution of sailfish from the Pacific Ocean also \n\nshows a similar trend to the South Atlantic with the largest fish being concentrated in the eastern \n\nside of that ocean (Kume and Joseph, 1969; Wares and Sakagawa, 1974; Prince and Goodyear, \n\n2006). The difference in size distribution of sailfish in both sides of the South Atlantic is likely \n\nlinked to life cycle and migratory movements, which, in turn, is probably related to the diverse \n\noceanographic conditions affecting habitat preferences of juveniles and adults in a different \n\nmanner. Prince and Goodyear (2006), however, attribute the larger size of eastern Atlantic and \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\neastern Pacific sailfish as a likely consequence of hypoxia based habitat compression which \n\nincreases ambush opportunities for sailfish which are compressed in a shallow surface layer \n\nalong with their prey. The eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean is characterized by intense nutrient \n\nupwelling with a consequently very shallow thermocline (~25 m) and high surface chlorophyll \n\nconcentration. Upwelling off the coasts of Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Nigeria occurs seasonally, \n\nwith a weak upwelling from January to March, and intense upwelling from July to September \n\n(Longhurst,1962; Picaut, 1983; Ibe and Ajayi, 1985). Conversely, the western Atlantic has a \n\nwarm surface layer, a deep thermocline (~75 m) and much lower surface chlorophyll \n\nconcentration (Hazin, 1993; Becker, 2001). Juveniles appear to be associated with waters with \n\nSSTs higher than 28\u00b0C in the western side, particularly between 10\u00b0 - 20\u00b0S and 25\u00b0 - 35\u00b0W. \n\nBesides, the higher concentration of juveniles in the western side can also be a result of their \n\nproximity to the spawning area, dispersing later from this location as they grow (Mourato et al., \n\n2009a). Adult sailfish, in turn, seem to be more common in the eastern side of the Atlantic with \n\nlarge concentrations occurring close to the African coast and the Gulf of Guinea, an area very \n\nrich in nutrient content, consequently, increasing the amount of potential sailfish prey, such as \n\nsmall cupleids, like Engraulis sp. and Sardinella sp. (Ibe and Ajayi, 1985; Ovichinikov, 1971). \n\nSailfish have an opportunistic feeding behavior and it is, thus, commonly attracted to regions \n\nwith high concentrations of prey (Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). \n\nThe model used in the current analyses considered four main environmental \n\nvariables: SST, mixed layer depth, chlorophyll concentration and bathymetry, all of which have \n\nbeen linked to billfish abundance (Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Ovichinikov, 1971; Nakamura, 1985; \n\nBrill and Lutcavage, 2001; Prince and Goodyear, 2006). Sailfish spend most of the time in the \n\nmixed layer and prefer waters with temperatures between 25\u00ba and 30\u00ba C, as shown by other \n\nstudies based on PSAT tags and ultrasonic telemetry (Hoolihan, 2004; Prince and Goodyear, \n\n2006; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Mourato et al., 2010). The preference for near surface and \n\nwarmer waters was also reported for other Istiophoridae fishes in the Atlantic Ocean (white \n\nmarlin, Tetrapturus albidus: Horodysky and Graves, 2005; Horodysky et al., 2007; blue marlin, \n\nMakaira nigricans: Graves et al., 2002; Goodyear et al., 2008). Therefore, sailfish and others \n\nIsthiophorids, the depth of mixed layer which marks the top of the thermocline is an important \n\nfeature that might directly affect vulnerability, catchability and local abundance. Prince and \n\nGoodyear (2006) pointed out that the depth distribution of sailfish in areas with intense \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nupwelling processes may be restricted to the thin layer as shallow as 25 m at the surface ocean by \n\nthe compression of the acceptable physical habitat due to the lower concentration of dissolved \n\noxygen below the thermocline, turning them more vulnerable to the surface fishing gears (i.e. \n\nlongline and gillnet).  \n\nIn the Eastern tropical Atlantic, sailfish abundance varies seasonally, linked to the \n\ncooling of surface water by the seasonal intensification of the upwelling process. Sailfish move \n\nalong the African coast from south to north, in spring, and apparently back again, from north to \n\nsouth, in autumn, following the warmer isotherms (Ovchinikov, 1971; Diouf, 1994; Bard et al., \n\n2002).  \n\nSimilarly, several studies have shown that sailfish abundance is highly seasonal in \n\nthe southwestern Atlantic Ocean, as well (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Hazin et al., 1994; \n\nMourato et al., 2009a and b). Mourato et al. (2009a) stated that the sailfish start its reproductive \n\nmigration from the Brazilian northeast coast to southeast, in mid-September, arriving in the \n\nsoutheast Brazilian coast in November/December. Spawning takes place mainly during January/ \n\nFebruary, with the species remaining near the southeast coast until early March. As it has been \n\nshown to occur with white and blue marlin, this southward migratory movement is probably \n\nrelated to the seasonal change of SST, reflected in the displacement of surface isotherms. Several \n\nauthors have reported that the sailfish migratory pattern is restricted to the 28\u00b0C surface isotherm \n\nin several parts of the world (Ovchinnikov, 1971;Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Nakamura, 1985), a SST \n\nthat occurs only during the 1st and 4th quarters of the year along the southeast coast of Brazil \n\n(Matsuura, 1986). \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Spatial Distribution of length frequency (LJFL) data obtained through the \nICCAT Data Record from 1998 to 2007.

Two GAMs were fit: (1) \u201cspatio-temporal\u201d including only \n\nlatitude, longitude, month, and year and (2) \u201coceanographic\u201d including sea surface temperature \n\n(SST), chlorophyll-a concentration, wind velocity, bottom depth, depth of mixed layer and year. \n\nThe spatio-temporal model explained more (average, ~30%) of the variation in catch rates than \n\nthe oceanographic model (average, ~18%). Catch rate predictions revealed a seasonally high \n\naggregation of sailfish off the southeast Brazilian coast during peak spawning (November to \n\nFebruary) while the mid-west Atlantic to the south of  ~15\u00b0S as well as the Brazilian north coast \n\nmay represent important  winter feeding grounds. The oceanographic model revealed that SST \n\nand wind velocity were the most important variables describing catch rate variation. The results \n\npresented herein may help to understand sailfish movements in the Atlantic Ocean and to \n\nimprove catch rate standardization.  \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nSailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, is a circumtropical epipelagic species mainly \n\ndistributed in subtropical and tropical oceanic waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, sailfish are \n\ndistributed from 40\u00baN to 40\u00baS in the west and from 50\u00baN to about 40\u00baS in the east (Beardsley et \n\nal., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). Important sport and artisanal (e.g. drift net) fisheries target these \n\nspecies in Atlantic waters (Brison et al., 2006; ICCAT, 2009), but sailfish are considered bycatch \n\nin most commercial longline fisheries targeting tunas (Thunnus spp.) and swordfish (Xiphias \n\ngladius) throughout the Atlantic Ocean (Restrepo et al., 2003). In Brazil, sailfish are caught \n\nprimarily by pelagic longline fisheries as incidental bycatch, although some are also caught by \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\ndrift gill nets. Off the Brazilian coast, sailfish are abundant throughout the year mainly in tropical \n\nareas with the peak abundance from October to February in the southeast Brazilian coast. From \n\n1991 to 2006, annual landings of sailfish in Brazil have fluctuated from 90 t in 1991, to 598 t in \n\n2000 and then decreased to 140 t in 2006.  \n\nAtlantic sailfish populations have been managed by the International Commission \n\nfor the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 1966. Based on distribution of catch, \n\ntagging information, and morphological data, ICCAT has traditionally considered this species to \n\ncomprise two different stocks in the Atlantic Ocean with western and eastern stocks separated \n\narbitrarily by the meridians associated with the mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 40\u00baW in the north Atlantic \n\nand 20\u00baW in the south Atlantic). Limited tag-recapture data has indicated no trans-Atlantic or \n\ntrans-equatorial movements (Ortiz et al., 2003; Orbesen et al., 2008).  Furthermore, analysis of \n\nthe distribution of catch-at-length data indicated that at least part of the sailfish population in the \n\nAtlantic was structured longitudinally by ontogenetic stages, as reflected by by environmental \n\npreferences of adults and juveniles or sub-adults (Mourato et al., 2010a).  This two-stock \n\nhypothesis, however, requires further investigation because genetic analyses suggest Atlantic \n\nsailfish comprise a single, highly mobile, pan-Atlantic stock (Graves 1998, Graves and \n\nMcDowell 2003).   \n\nFor highly migratory fishes, one of the essential requirements for understanding \n\npopulation dynamics is the delineation of the spatial variability of the stock during important \n\nbiological processes. Migration to spawning grounds is believed to be the dominant behavioral \n\naspect of fish aggregation (Laevastu and Hayes, 1981).  Therefore, understanding migratory \n\ncorridors and cues are essential for ecosystem-based management and conservation.  Earlier \n\nstudies have highlighted the southwestern Atlantic Ocean as an important spawning ground for \n\nsailfish (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et al., 2009a). Limited tagging data prevent a \n\ncharacterization of the mechanisms affecting sailfish distribution, including the possible \n\ninfluence of environmental factors during important life-cycle events. Based on catch-effort \n\nstatistics, SST it thought to significantly affect the horizontal distribution patterns of sailfish \n\n(Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Ovchinnikov, 1971). In addition, vertical movements may be limited by \n\nthe concentration of dissolved oxygen, depth of the mixed-layer, or by an 8\u00b0C change in water \n\ntemperature (Brill and Lutcavage, 2001).  For example, limited dissolved oxygen may act as a \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nbarrier to constrain vertical movements in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (Prince and Goodyear, \n\n2006; Prince et al., 2010).  \n\nPopulation dynamics models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity in vital \n\nbiological parameters are needed to understand species distribution and impacts of commercial \n\nexploitation on stocks (Cadrin and Secor, 2009).  Due to significant gaps in the knowledge about \n\nsailfish biology and catch rates in the Atlantic, a study was undertaken to describe the spatio-\n\ntemporal pattern of sailfish abundance in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean. \n\nMoreover, key environmental variables were evaluated to determine the possible affect(s) on the \n\ndistribution and catchability of sailfish during important life-cycle events. These analyses \n\nallowed us to address various aspects of the ecology of sailfish, particularly with inferences \n\nabout the kinds of variables that influence sailfish distribution during spawning. \n\n4.2. Material and Methods \n\n4.2.1. Catch and effort data \n\nData on catch and nominal fishing effort were obtained from logbooks of the \n\nBrazilian pelagic tuna longline fleet (national and chartered vessels) which were completed by \n\nfishing captains during trips from 2004 to 2008. The logbooks contain vessel identification, date, \n\nlocation of fishing ground (latitude and longitude), time of the longline set and retrieval, fishing \n\neffort in number of hooks and the number of fish caught by species.  \n\nIn order to have a homogenous data set, the analyses were limited to shallow (&lt;\n\n120 m), nighttime longline sets that targeted swordfish (n=18,395 sets). Deep daytime (>200 m) \n\nsets that targeted tunas (n=1,936) were deleted. Longline sets were distributed throughout a wide \n\narea of the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from 7\u00b0N to 40\u00b0S and 50\u00b0W to \n\n0\u00b0 (Figure 4.1). However, due to the low fishing effort and no sailfish catches below 35\u00b0S (33 \n\nsets), the analysis was constrained to a narrower area, ranging from 7\u00baN to 35\u00baS and 50\u00baW to \n\n10\u00baW (18,362 sets) (Figure 4.1).  \n\n4.2.2. Environmental data \n\nTime-series of SST (\u00baC), depth (m) of the mixed layer (DML) and zonal and \n\nmeridional wind components were obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nArchive Center (PODAAC) - Jet Propulsion Laboratory/ NASA (2004-2008). Wind velocity \n\n(m/s) estimates were obtained for each fishing location from wind velocity = ? (meridional wind2 \n\n+ zonal wind2). The bottom depth (m) at the deployment location was obtained from the National \n\nGeophysical Data Center (ETOPO5- Earth Topography 5 min) and data on chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentrations (Chla) were obtained from SeaWiFS images, provided by the Goddard Space \n\nFlight Center/ NASA and converted to mg*m3. These data, with an original resolution of 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 \n\n0.5\u00b0 (except Chla with initial resolution of 9 km x 9 km resolution), were used to construct a \n\ndatabase of 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 resolution assembled by day, month, year, latitude and longitude.  These data \n\nwere then matched to the fisheries catch and effort data on the same temporal and spatial scale.  \n\n4.2.3. Generalized additive model fitting procedures  \n\n Generalized additive models (GAMs) using penalized regression splines \n\n(estimated by penalized iterative least squares, Wood, 2006) were applied to predict areas with \n\nhigh catch rates. Data were separated into two distinct periods: (a) spawning (November to \n\nFebruary) and; (b) non-spawning (March to October). The spawning period was determined \n\nbased on the spatial differences of monthly mean gonadal index values and the non-spawning \n\nperiod was assumed to commence immediately after spawning within the study area (Figure 4.1) \n\n(Mourato et al., 2009). Since there was high correlation between SST and latitude (r = 0.83) and \n\nbetween bottom depth and longitude (r = 0.63), two kinds of models were used to avoid \n\nconfounding issues with multiple collinearity (Maunder and Punt, 2004; Zuur et al., 2010): (1) \n\n\u201cspatio-temporal\u201d, included the factors year, month, latitude and longitude; and (2) \n\n\u201coceanographic\u201d which included several environmental variables, as well as year, to account for \n\ninter-annual variability. Formulations of these models were: \n\n- Spatio-temporal model: \n\ncatch ~ year + month + s(longitude, latitude) + offset(log[fishing effort]) + e \n\n- Oceanographic model: \n\ncatch ~ year + s(wind) + s(bathymetry) + s(SST) + s(Chla) + s(DML) + \n\noffset(log[fishing effort]) + e; \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nwhere catch is the number of sailfish caught per set, s (longitude, latitude) represents the effect of \n\nthe spatial location as an isotropic bivariate function (Wood and Augustin, 2002), fishing effort \n\nis an offset term, and e is an error term from any distribution from the exponential family. Two \n\nmain parametric predictors (i.e. factors) were considered: year (n = 5 levels, 2004 thru 2008), \n\nand month (n = 4 levels, November thru February for the spawning period and; n = 8 levels, \n\nMarch thru October, for the non-spawning period). Models were fit using the mgcv package in R \n\n2.12.0  (R Development Core Team, 2010) with the optimum degree of smoothing being \n\nestimated by the generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion (Wood, 2006).  \n\nDue the high percentage of zeros in the catch data (~60%, sets with no sailfish \n\ncatches), three statistical probability distributions were initially considered: Poisson, negative \n\nbinomial and Tweedie. A Poisson distribution is a common approach to model spatio-temporal \n\ndistributions of count data (Augustin et al., 1998) and the negative binomial GAMs were \n\nimplemented using automatic selection of a scale parameter ? available in package mgcv (Wood, \n\n2006). For the Tweedie distribution, the estimation of the power-parameter was obtained by \n\nmaximizing the likelihood for each value candidate (Dunn and Smith, 2005). The final \n\nestimation of this parameter was approximately 1.3 (compound Poisson-gamma distribution), \n\nwhich was considered appropriate for the analysis (Shono, 2008).  \n\nThe selection of predictors and the decision on their entry or exclusion was based \n\non the GCV score, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1978) and the total deviance \n\nexplained. However, in mgcv, fitting algorithms using GCV scores for negative binomial is not \n\nappropriate (Wood, 2006). Thus, for negative binomial models the selection of predictors was \n\nevaluated by AIC and the total deviance explained. Chi-square tests were also computed to \n\ndetermine whether predictors yielded significant (p &lt;0.05) reductions in the residual deviance \n\nupon entry into the GAM. Lastly, selection of the best statistical probability distribution for the \n\noceanographic and spatio-temporal models for each period (i.e. spawning or non-spawning) was \n\nbased on distribution of residuals, lowest values of AIC and Bayesian Information Criterion \n\n(BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) and the total deviance explained.  \n\n4.3. Results \n\nOf 18,362 sets analyzed, 6,492 sets corresponded to the spawning period and \n\n11,870 sets to the non-spawning period and the proportion of positive catches (sets with at least \n\nhttp://??\nhttp://??\nhttp://??\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\none sailfish caught) was 42% and 35% for the spawning and non-spawning periods, respectively. \n\nHowever, the proportion of positive catches varied over time with the highest proportions \n\noccurring in 2005 for the spawning period (53%), and 2004 for the non-spawning period (38%). \n\nThe distribution of sailfish catch per set showed a highly skewed distribution, with high numbers \n\nof zeros and few observations of greater than five sailfish captured per set (Figure 4.2).  \n\n4.3.1. Modeling \n\nFor both the spawning and non-spawning periods, the results of the spatio-\n\ntemporal models indicated that the negative binomial distribution provided the best fit (Table \n\n4.1). The oceanographic model, using data from the spawning period, exhibited the lowest AIC \n\nand BIC scores (Table 4.1). However, during the non-spawning period, the best fit for the \n\noceanographic model was provided by the Tweedie distribution. For all models, the traditional \n\nPoisson distribution had the highest AIC and BIC scores, in comparison with negative binomial \n\nand Tweedie models (Table 4.1). Though there were only small AIC and BIC differences \n\nbetween the negative binomial and the Tweedie models, the negative binomial oceanographic \n\nmodel explained a higher proportion of the deviance (18.0% vs 16.5%). Residuals from the \n\nnegative binomial distribution (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4) showed a better fit in comparison with \n\nTweedie and Poisson models and suggests no evidence of heteroscedacity.  Based on these \n\ncriteria, all analyses were consequently based on the negative binomial distribution.  \n\n4.3.2. Selection and significance of variables in the models \n\nAll terms added to the spatio-temporal models for both the spawning period and \n\nthe non-spawning period were highly statically significant (p &lt;2.20-16) and resulted in a decrease \n\nin AIC value (Table 4.2). The isotropic bivariate s(longitude, latitude) term was the most \n\nimportant for both periods. For the spawning period, the effect of geographic location accounted \n\nfor 31.6% of the explained deviance, while for the non-spawning period this contribution was \n\n26%. Other variables (month and year) were also significant, however with much lower \n\nexplanatory power (Table 4.2). All terms added to the analysis of deviance for the oceanographic \n\nmodels were statistically significant (p &lt;2.20-16) and resulted in greater resolving power (i.e. \n\nlower AIC value) (Table 4.3). For the spawning period; based on percentage deviance explained, \n\nwind velocity and ocean depth were the most important terms, followed by year, SST, Chla and \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nDML (Table 4.3).  By contrast, during the non-spawning period, SST was the most important \n\nfactor. The inclusion of other oceanographic parameters in this model also resulted in a decrease \n\nof residual deviance with wind velocity being the most important factor, followed by Chla, \n\nbathymetry, year and DML (Table 4.3).  \n\n4.3.3. Spatiotemporal trends of catch rates \n\nThe spatial prediction (Figure 4.5 ) of sailfish catch rates for spawning and non-\n\nspawning periods show spatio-temporal variation of sailfish densities in the South Atlantic. \n\nDuring the spawning period, three distinct areas of high densities were evident: (1)  the largest \n\narea was in a oceanic region, between  5\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S and 20\u00b0W and 30\u00b0W; (2) the second area \n\nwas situated close to the southeastern coast of Brazil, between 15\u00b0S and 25\u00b0S and 39\u00b0W and \n\n50\u00b0W; and (3) the third area was from 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0S and from 39\u00b0W to 45\u00b0W (Figure 4.5). During \n\nthe non-spawning period, the most prominent feature was the disappearance of sailfish from \n\nsoutheastern Brazil and the notable increase in catch in the more oceanic region of the South \n\nAtlantic, extending from 5\u00b0S to 20\u00b0S and from 18\u00b0W to 35\u00b0W (Figure 4.5). The high catch area \n\nclose to the northern coast of Brazil was present in both periods with a slight north-west \n\ndisplacement during the non-spawning period.  \n\nStandardized catch rates for all models and periods were very similar, except for \n\nthe strong peak in 2005 in the spatio-temporal model during spawning. A moderate decline of \n\nstandardized catch rates is evident for all models throughout the time period analysed in this \n\nstudy (Figure 4.6). The standard deviations of the year effects are provided in the Table 4.4. \n\nMonthly patterns show that sailfish abundance is expected to be high during the spawning period \n\n(November to January), followed by a strong decline in February (Figure 4.7). During the non-\n\nspawning, sailfish abundance is highest during the months before and after the spawning season \n\nwhich coincides with warmer water temperatures (Figure 4.7).  \n\n4.3.4. Environmental effects on catch rate \n\nFigure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 depict the smoothed terms from the oceanographic \n\nmodel during the spawning and non-spawning periods, respectively. During spawning, sailfish \n\ncatch rates are expected to be highest when the wind velocity is higher than 4 m/s with the most \n\npronounced peak ? 9 m/s (Figure 4.8) and a similar trend was also observed during the non-\n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nspawning period with higher catch rates associated with higher wind velocities (Figure 4.9). As \n\nexpected, the influence of bottom depth on sailfish catch rate was different between spawning \n\nand non-spawning periods. During spawning, higher catch rates were associated with coastal \n\nareas (&lt;2000 m, Figure 4.8), especially off southeastern of Brazil (Figure 4.5). However, high \n\ncatch rates were also noted in waters greater than 5000 m deep (Figure 4.8), which may be \n\nassociated with a different water mass, between 5\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S (Figure 4.5). In the non-spawning \n\nperiod, the effect of variability in bottom depth indicated sailfish were more concentrated in \n\nwaters greater than 3500 m deep (Figure 4.9) as shown by the distribution maps (Figure 4.5). \n\n The influence of SST on sailfish abundance was similar for the two periods, with \n\nthe highest catch rates occurring when SST was >26\u00b0C (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9). Off all \n\nfactors examined, however, SST was the most important variable to explain distribution of \n\nsailfish catch rates for non-spawning activities, while during spawning, wind velocity was the \n\nmost prominent variable (Table 4.3). Sailfish catch rate were similar between spawning and non-\n\nspawning periods regarding chlprophyll a concentrations with the highest values in the range \n\nbetween 0.6 and 1.0 mg*m3, followed by a decline thereafter (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9).  \n\n4.4. Discussion \n\nIn an effort to understand variability in sailfish catch rates in the western and \n\nsouth Atlantic, various GAMs were investigated to analyze the spatio-temporal trends in catch \n\nwith spawning seasonality and environmental factors incorporated into models.  Moreover, also \n\nlinked to models was a spatially explicit gonadal index value (to assess reproductive activity) \n\n(Mourato et al., 2009a).  By matching catch statistics with biological and environmental factors \n\non the same scale, our analysis suggested a new insight about the spatio-temporal catch \n\nvariability of sailfish in southwestern Atlantic and the factors that influence catchability and \n\navailability of sailfish associated with pelagic longline fishery. \n\n4.4.1. Modeling approach \n\nThe negative binomial distribution appeared to be the most appropriate \n\ndistribution to analyze sailfish catch rates caught by the Brazilian longline fleet based on \n\ndistribution of residuals, AIC, and percentage of deviance explained. Due to high correlation \n\nbetween SST and latitude and between bottom depth and longitude, we fitted models with spatial \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nand environmental predictors separately to avoid problems with collinearity. When SST and \n\nbottom depth were fit in a single model, the results were non-intuitive as higher sailfish catch \n\nrates were associated with lower SST (<18\u00b0C), but this species has been described by several \n\nauthors to prefer warmer waters ranging from 24\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (Ovchinikov, 1971; Beardsley et al., \n\n1975; Nakamura, 1985). The unrealistic effect of SST, however, is probably related to problems \n\nof concurvity, a common problem in GAM modeling. Concurvity is the non-parametric analogue \n\nof colinearity where the effect of one of the predictors (e.g. SST) can be approximated by a \n\nlinear combination of the effects of other predictors (i.e. latitude) (Ramsay et al., 2003; Figueiras \n\net al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2006). For these reasons, the separate treatment of environmental \n\nparameters from the spatial parameters was crucial to better assess the effects of environmental \n\neffects on the spatio-temporal distribution of sailfish catch rates, as well as to avoid bias caused \n\nby over parameterization. \n\n4.4.2. Spatiotemporal trends of catch rates  \n\nPrevious authors have reported that the southeast Brazilian coast is an important \n\nspawning area for sailfish from December to February (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et \n\nal., 2009).  The observations in our study also provide evidence of a major spawning ground in \n\nthe south Atlantic. Moreover, based on relatively high densities and low gonadal index values \n\nthroughout the year (Mourato et al., 2009a), the mid-west Atlantic (i.e. south of 15\u00b0S), as well as \n\nthe north coast of Brazil may represent important winter feeding grounds areas. Additionally, our \n\nfindings are also supported by Mourato et al. (2010a) which showed that the proportion of adults \n\non the three hotspots indentified in the present study is much higher than juveniles or sub-adults \n\nproportion and the average size of the specimens caught by the Brazilian pelagic longline fishery \n\non these aforementioned areas is higher than the length of sexual maturity estimated for sailfish \n\nin the southwestern Atlantic. Hence we may consider that the specimens caught in these areas are \n\nable to reproduce.  \n\nBased on the reproductive data and catch rate analyses, it can be hypothesized that \n\nstarting in October, mature sailfish migrate from the western central tropical Atlantic towards the \n\nsoutheast Brazilian coast to spawn and remain in the area from about February to March. After \n\nspawning, sailfish probably migrate in a north-east direction perhaps following the south Atlantic \n\ngyre (Peterson and Stramma, 1991), to return to the tropical western central tropical Atlantic to \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nforage.  Pop-up satellite archival tagging of two sailfish indicated that fish may remain off \n\nsoutheastern coast of Brazil during the spawning season for periods up to one month (Mourato et \n\nal., 2010b).  \n\n4.4.3. Impact of environmental factors \n\nThe spatio-temporal models had better explanatory ability to explain variability of \n\nsailfish catch rates than oceanographic models. A lower explanatory ability and a larger residual \n\ndeviance of the oceanographic models were, however, not unexpected, since the inclusion of \n\nenvironmental variables in the modeling of species distribution can be problematic (Brill and \n\nLutcavage, 2001) when remotely sensed predictor variables represent averages over time and \n\nspace. The relationship between environmental variables and sailfish relative abundance, \n\nhowever, may help explain habitat preferences during spawning.  \n\nResults showed that sailfish were caught over a large SST range (16 ? 29\u00b0C) and \n\nhigher densities were associated with warmer waters (>26\u00b0C) during both spawning and non-\n\nspawning periods. It is thought that during September to October, sailfish migrate southward \n\nprior to spawning, and afterwards they migrate to the north-east.  Changes in catch and sailfish \n\ndistribution were probably related to seasonal changes in SST, and in particular, the \n\ndisplacement of 28\u00b0C surface isotherm during these movements. Temperature strongly \n\ninfluences fish metabolism and during spawning, may accelerate the process of gonadal \n\ndevelopment (Freon and Misund 1999). Several authors described that sailfish migration was \n\nprobably restricted to the 28\u00b0C surface isotherm in several parts of the world (Ovchinnikov, \n\n1971; Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Nakamura 1985). Furthermore, information from satellite tagging \n\nalso suggested the preference of sailfish for warm waters of the uniform surface mixed-layer \n\n(Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Mourato et al., 2010b).  \n\nThe appearance of sailfish on spawning grounds and in fisheries off southeast \n\nBrazil may be related to the oceanographic conditions that prevail during warm periods. The \n\nintrusion of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) during summer over the continental shelf and \n\nslope may be related to sailfish reproduction in the southwestern Atlantic. The SACW is \n\ncharacterized by temperatures lower than 18\u00b0C, salinity ranging between 34.4 and 36 ppt and a \n\nhigh concentration of nutrients (Matsuura, 1986). The seasonal expansion of the SACW \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\npromotes an influx of deep nutrients to the shallow parts of water column and consequently may \n\naccumulate large concentrations of potential prey items for sailfish larvae, juveniles and adults. \n\nOn the other hand, there is currently no evidence of a fishery oceanographic relationship that \n\ncould help explain the high sailfish densities observed in more oceanic areas between 5\u00b0S and \n\n15\u00b0S and in the area close to the northern coast of Brazil.  \n\nDespite the preference of sailfish for warmer waters, which are usually more \n\noligotrophic, the higher band of chlorophyll concentration (>0.9 mg*m3) had a negative effect on \n\nthe catch rate. This might be explained by the time needed for the chlorophyll bloom to mature \n\ninto forage for sailfish, such as squid and small pelagic fish. Similar patterns were also observed \n\nfor blue shark in the southwest Atlantic (Mourato et al., 2008) and albacore in the northwest \n\nPacific (Laurs, 1983).  For example, Lehodey et al. (1998) suggest it takes about 3 months for a \n\nchlorophyll bloom to mature into forage for skipjack tuna in the equatorial Pacific. \n\nWind velocity may also affect the availability and vulnerability of sailfish, as well \n\nas the behavior of the longline. The higher sailfish catch rates associated with high wind \n\nvelocities may be an indirect result of other operational variables related to the behavior of the \n\nfishing gear in the water column. For example, higher wind stress may induce greater vertical \n\nhook movements, which would increase sailfish vulnerability to the baited hooks. Higher wind \n\nvelocities associated with higher current velocities, for instance, may shoal and therefore reduce \n\nthe fishing depth of the pelagic longline gear by ?50% (Bigelow et al., 2006).  Similar longline \n\nshoaling may occur in the western equatorial Atlantic (B.L. Mourato, unpublished data), thus \n\nincreasing sailfish vulnerability given the reported shallow vertical distribution based on free-\n\nranging animals (Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Mourato et al., 2010b). \n\nIdentification of spawning areas in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean will be useful for delineating \n\nstock structure of sailfish in the Atlantic. Furthermore, areas of high catch rates could be \n\nincluded in models that may prove valuable for catch rate standardizations which in turn could \n\nprovide information on catchability.  \n\nThe inclusion of oceanographic variables in catch rate standardization, however, \n\nhad a small statistical benefit since the standardized catch rates were very similar to spatial-\n\ntemporal models. On the other hand, the oceanographic models provided a better understanding \n\nof fishery oceanographic relationships, the physiological ecology of sailfish and the possible \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nrelationship between the fishing gear behavior and catchability (e.g., wind velocity effect). New \n\napplications incorporating other oceanographic variables (e.g., dissolved oxygen) are still \n\nrequired to improve the understanding of the environmental effects on sailfish catches. Finally, \n\nthe fishery oceanographic relationships presented herein should also be tested and developed in \n\nother areas with sailfish fisheries in order to better evaluate the benefits of the inclusion of \n\nenvironmental factors on catch rate standardization. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Summary of model diagnostics used to select the error distribution of the \nspatiotemporal and oceanographic models for sailfish caught by Brazilian longline fleet in \nthe southwestern Atlantic Ocean from 2004 to 2008.

PSATs were deployed on four \n\nsailfish in the coastal waters of Rio de Janeiro State located in Southeast Brazilian coast during \n\nJanuary and February of 2009 (for the tags sailfish I and sailfish II) and between November 2010 \n\nand January 2011 (for the tags sailfish III and sailfish IV).  Wildlife Computers Inc MK10 PAT \n\nmodel were the tags used. The total number of days monitored (such as the time that the tags \n\nremained attached) were 12 (sailfish I), 51 (sailfish II), 16 (sailfish III) and 43 days (sailfish IV). \n\nIn brief, the results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat utilization of sailfish, with the \n\nmajority of the time spent being predominantly concentrated near the sea surface with a \n\nrelatively narrow temperature range preference. Despite the preference for surface waters the \n\ntagged sailfish demonstrated vertical movements into deeper waters (around 50 m depth) \n\nregularly within 3 to 6 hour interval. In brief, the \u201cmost probable tracks\u201d suggest that tagged \n\nsailfish did not move significantly away from the tagging site. Sailfish I moved southeastward \n\naway from the Brazilian coast until the 7th day of liberty, presenting, after that, a westward \n\nmovement towards the Brazilian coast, until the pop-up event, very close of the tagging site. \n\nSailfish II moved towards southeast farther away from the Brazilian coast with the position of \n\nthe first transmission of tag relatively not too far from the tagging site. Sailfish III showed \n\nrelatively meandering moving behavior however with the position of the first transmission of tag \n\nbeing relatively close to the coast. Sailfish IV moved initially southward, presenting \n\nsubsequently an eastward movement farther away from the Brazilian coast, but returning towards \n\nthe continent, until the pop-up event.  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nInformation about habitat selection and migration of highly migratory species, like \n\ntunas and billfishes, is of primary interest for stock assessment and management, since they are \n\nkey factors in the identification of stock units. The distribution and time variability at different \n\nscales (i.e. circadian, seasonal, interannual) of fish stocks help to delineate how many fisheries \n\nare exploiting a given stock and conversely how many stocks a given fishery is exploiting (Fr\u00e9on \n\nand Misund, 1999). Furthermore, the habitat utilization and movements also govern the \n\navailability of fish in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, thus directly affecting the \n\ncatchability coefficient and consequently the catch rates (Fr\u00e9on and Misund, 1999, Bigelow and \n\nMaunder 2007). Therefore, it is indispensable that these factors be taken into account in the \n\ndevelopment of abundance indices for stock assessments purposes and related management \n\nadvice.  \n\nHowever, the gathering of information on migration and habitat selection of large \n\npelagic fish has always presented several challenging obstacles. Traditionally, information on \n\nspatiotemporal variability of fish stocks has been obtained by analysis of catch-per-unit-effort \n\n(CPUE) from commercial fisheries. However, the use of nominal CPUE to estimate abundance \n\nhas been criticized for a long time (Garstang, 1900; Baranov, 1918; Ricker, 1940; Mar, 1953), \n\nsince the basic assumptions (e.g., fish and fishing effort are randomly distributed) are rarely met \n\n(Hilborn and Walters, 1992).  \n\nOn the other hand, the practice of fish tagging has provided valuable information \n\nabout fish movements and distribution, particularly because of its \u201cfisheries-independent\u201d nature. \n\nThe first tagging experiments on billfishes took place in the early 50s, through a cooperative \n\ntagging program operating out of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, in Massachusetts (USA). \n\nDuring this program, between 1954 and 1960, 1,305 sailfish and 1,500 white marlins were \n\ntagged (Mather, 1963). Few years later, by 1965, around 6,793 sailfish had already been tagged. \n\nIn the other side of the USA, in the Pacific Ocean, extensive billfish tagging were also \n\nhappening. During the first International Billfish Symposium held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii \n\n(USA), in 1972, the results of 15,540 billfish tagged in that ocean were also reported. An \n\nextensive literature review on the application of conventional tagging in large teleosts, including \n\ntuna and tuna-like fishes is available in Bayliff (1993, 1996) and Ortiz et al. (2003).  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nDespite of its great utility for the understanding of fish longevity and movements, \n\nconventional tagging studies are rather limited, since they provide only fish positions at release \n\nand recapture. The actual track taken by the fish between these two points, as well as its daily \n\nvertical movements, are therefore impossible to infer. Besides, conventional tagging depends \n\ndirectly on fishing to recover the tagged fish. In the mid-1950s, however, the underwater \n\ntelemetry in form of acoustic tags began to allow fishery biologists to actually follow individual \n\nfish over several days, making it possible to describe their behavior and simultaneously to collect \n\ndata about the surrounding physical environment (Arnold and Dewar 2001).  \n\nThe first experiment of acoustic telemetry on sailfish was conducted by Jolley and \n\nIrby (1979) off the east coast of Florida (USA), aiming at the assessment of the pos-release \n\nmortality of eight tagged sailfish. Since then, technological advances, such as the reduction in \n\nsize and weight of the acoustic tags, as well as the increase of battery life and signal strength \n\n(Reine, 2005), have allowed the application of telemetry studies in several billfishes, including \n\nstriped marlin (Holts and Bedford, 1990; Brill et al., 1993), blue marlin (Holland et al., 1990; \n\nBlock et al. 1992a and b), black marlin (Pepperell and Davis, 1999), and swordfish (Carey and \n\nRobison, 1981; Carey, 1990). More recently Hoolihan (2004) utilized acoustic telemetry to \n\ninvestigate the small scale movements of sailfish in the Arabian Gulf, showing that the depth \n\ndistribution of this specie is predominantly superficial with more than 84.3% of its time being \n\nspent in the first 10m. \n\nDespite the importance of acoustic telemetry to the advance on the knowledge of \n\nvertical and horizontal movements of fish, this technique still has some limitations, since it \n\nrequires the active following of the tagged animal. The length of observation on active acoustic \n\ntelemetry is therefore usually restricted to relatively short periods of time (few days), restrained \n\nby vessel autonomy, crew fatigue and tag battery life. The advent of the automatic pop-up tags in \n\nthe late 1990s, however, gave a new impulse to the research on the migratory movements of \n\nmarine animals.  \n\nThe pop-up tags record data on ambient light levels, which can be analyzed with \n\ndaily geolocations algorithms to determine the geographic position during the track period, depth \n\nand water temperature. Basically, the pop-up tags continuously record data for a predetermined \n\nperiod and set intervals, automatically detaching  itself from the fish when this period it attained. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nIt then floats to the sea surface and transmit all stored data by satellite through the ARGOS \n\nSystem (Worldwide Tracking and Environmental Monitoring by Satellite). The most beneficial \n\nfeature of this innovative technology in comparison to the acoustic telemetry is the possibility of \n\na long-term monitoring (months to years) of marine animals (Arnold and Dewar, 2001). \n\nMoreover, the pop-up tags are \u201cfisheries independent\u201d which means that the recapture of the \n\nanimal is not necessary. This is a very important characteristic since that the recapture rates in \n\nsome remote locations might be very low. Furthermore, this technology also allows the tracking \n\nof species, such as marine mammals and turtles, which are not targeted by fishery operations.  \n\nThe first studies on scombrid fish using pop-up tag were done on the Atlantic \n\nbluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) (Block et al., 1998, Lutcavage et al., 2000). The first study with \n\npop-up tags in billfishes were conducted by Graves et al. (2000) to understand the mechanisms \n\nthat affect the post-release survival of Atlantic blue marlin after capture with recreational fishing \n\ngears. The first experiment with pop-up tags in a sailfish, was conducted by Hoolihan (2004) in \n\nthe Gulf of Arabia. Prince and Goodyear (2006) also deployed pop-up tags in sailfish and blue \n\nmarlins in the Northwestern Atlantic and in the Eastern Central Pacific to assess and compare the \n\nvertical distribution of these species in these two oceans. Few years later, Hoolihan and Luo \n\n(2007) provided detailed information of 18 sailfish tagged with pop-up tags to assess the summer \n\nresidence of the species the in the Gulf of Arabia. Studies of post-release mortality estimates for \n\nsailfish with pop-up tags were later conducted Kerstetter and Graves (2008) based on pelagic \n\nlongline fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. More recently, Hoolihan et al. (2009) also provided \n\ndetailed information about vertical movements of sailfish in the western North Atlantic, based on \n\ntwo recovered pop-up tags.  \n\nIn this context, in the present chapter the satellite telemetry technology was \n\nutilized in order to better understand and determine the summer presence, residence time and \n\nmovements of sailfish during and after spawning season in southeast Brazilian coast. \n\n5.2. Material and Methods \n\n5.2.1. Field Operation and PSAT tag programming  \n\nPSATs were deployed on four sailfish in the coastal waters of Rio de Janeiro State \n\nlocated in Southeast Brazil during January and February of 2009 (for tagged sailfish I and \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nsailfish II) and between November 2010 and January 2011 (for tagged sailfish III and sailfish \n\nIV).  Wildlife Computers Inc (Redmond, WA, USA) MK10 PAT tags were used. The tags were \n\nprogrammed to record depth, temperature and light intensity every second. The depth and \n\ntemperature records were compiled into histograms at 3-hour intervals (for sailfish I and sailfish \n\nII) and at 6-hour intervals (for sailfish III and sailfish IV), with sampling every 60 s. The \n\nminimum and maximum temperature bins were programmed for temperatures ?12\u00b0C and ?30\u00b0C, \n\nwhile the depth bins were programmed to sample the minimum depth of ? 1 m (or 0) and \n\nmaximum depth of 300 m. These bins were chosen based on the vertical movement behavior of \n\nsailfish in other areas (Hoolihan, 2004, Prince and Goodyear, 2006). The data collected included \n\nthe minimum and maximum temperature and depth, and amount of time spent in each of 13 \n\nspecified depth and temperature bins for each sampled interval (Table 5.1).  \n\nThe pop-up tags were programmed for a deployment period of 60 days (sailfish I \n\nand sailfish II) and 140 days (sailfish III and sailfish IV). A pressure-activated mechanical \n\ndetachment device was also used, to prevent data loss in the event of fish mortality, remaining at \n\nconstant depth or going over 1000m. Release locations were obtained from global positioning \n\nsystems onboard the tagging vessel and pop-up locations were obtained directly from the \n\nARGOS transmissions. The tags were prepared with a tether made of nylon monofilament with ? \n\n16-20 cm of length. To alleviate torque forces, a swivel was placed halfway along the tether \n\n(Figure 5.1).  \n\nDeployment of pop-up tags was conducted from recreational fishing vessels using \n\nstandard trolling gear with natural bait and titanium circle hooks in order to increase the chances \n\nof survival of tagged fish. Once fish were hooked and brought to leader and reeled close to the \n\nboat, the tag was deployed. The tagging target area was a little below the base of the dorsal fin, \n\nbetween the interneural and neural spines (Musyl and Naughton, 2007, Figure 5.2). The PSAT \n\ntags were anchored by a harpoon equipped with a stainless steel tag applicator modified to be \n\ndriven 5-7 cm into the dorsal musculature. Prior to release, individual weights and lengths were \n\nestimated.  \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Horizontal distribution \n\nLight intensity records were pre-processed using the global positioning software \n\nWC-GPE (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA) to get the daily raw geo-locations (i.e. \n\nunfiltered and uncorrected estimates) of tagged fish for each day at liberty. Then, the Kalman \n\nFilter State-Space Model (KFTRACK) (Sibert et al., 2003) was applied to predict the most \n\nprobable track of the tagged fish. The KFTRACK model was fitted using the \u201cKFTRACK \n\npackage\u201d (http://www.nielsensweb.org/ukfsst/).  \n\n5.2.3. Vertical distribution \n\nAfter running the KFTRACK algorithm, the daily geographical position of the \n\ntagged fish was used to estimate the times of sunrise, sunset, and local noon using standard \n\nastronomical formulae (Duffett-Smith, 1988). Then the local sunrise and sunset at estimated \n\nlongitudes were used to assign three distinct periods (day, night and transition) to the data. \n\nAlthough most works on satellite telemetry have used only day and night periods, the transition \n\nperiod was necessary in the present study since the tags were programmed to compile data into \n\nhistograms at 3-hour intervals (e.g. for sailfish I and II, from 5AM to 8AM and from 5PM to \n\n8PM). For sailfish III and IV, however, this procedure was not needed since the tags were \n\nprogrammed to compile data into histograms at 6-hour intervals, requiring the assignment of \n\nonly night and day periods.  \n\nAfter assigning the period of the day to the data, a chi-square goodness-of-fit test \n\n(G-test) was applied to evaluate the independence between the temperature and depth \n\ndistributions within and among tags. All statistical tests were performed at the p = 0.05 level of \n\nsignificance. Furthermore in order to look for similarities between periods and tags, the \n\nfrequency distributions of the proportion of time at depth and temperature were formatted into an \n\ninput matrix to apply a non-hierarchical cluster analysis (based on euclidean distances and \n\n\u201cward\u201d method).  \n\nThe proportions of records within successively deeper layers of temperature, \n\nrelative to the temperature of the surface mixed layer (termed Delta T; Goodyear et al., 2008) by \n\neach 3 h (sailfish I e II) or 6 h (sailfish III e IV) intervals were also calculated for the period that \n\ncould be clearly identified as day, night or transition time. Average daily surface temperature \n\nhttp://www.nielsensweb.org/ukfsst/\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nwas calculated by extracting the temperatures from PDT data where depth was ? 10 m. Delta T \n\nvalues were then calculated by subtracting the mean temperature of each PDT observation from \n\nthe generated average daily temperature values and tabulating the proportion of time spent at \n\ntemperatures using 1\u00b0C bin resolution. \n\n5.3. Results \n\n5.3.1. Tag deployments and performance \n\nThe estimated sizes and weights of the tagged fish ranged were from 135 to \n\n165 cm (Eye-Fork length - EFL) and from 20 to 30 kg. Fish were hooked in the mouth and \n\nappeared in good condition when released. However, all sailfish lost their PSAT prematurely and \n\nbegan transmitting data before the expected dates (60 or 140 days after deployment). The total \n\nnumber of days monitored (i.e. the period of time the tags remained attached) were 12 (sailfish \n\nI), 51 (sailfish II), 16 (sailfish III) and 43 days (sailfish IV). However, the total percentage of \n\ndata successfully transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system was 82%, 75%, 46% and \n\n12.5% of the total archived data for the tags I, II, III and IV, respectively. The geographical \n\npositions (raw geolocations) were obtained for only 63 days (sailfish I: 12 days; sailfish II: 21 \n\ndays; sailfish III: 18 days; and sailfish IV: 12 days). \n\n5.3.2. Vertical habitat use and temperature preference \n\nThe results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat utilization of sailfish, with \n\nthe majority of the time being spent near the sea surface with a relatively narrow temperature \n\nrange preference. Sailfish I spent 67%, 90% and 81% between 0 and 10 m, during day, night and \n\ntransition periods, respectively, while sailfish II spent 72%, 69% and 66%, in the same depth \n\nstratum and periods (Figure 5.3). Sailfish III spent 73% and 64% between 0 and 10 m during day \n\nand night periods, respectively, while sailfish IV spent 72% and 54% in the same depth stratum \n\nand periods (Figure 5.3). \n\nSailfish I remained in waters with temperatures between 25\u00b0 and 28\u00b0C for 90% of \n\nday time, 87% of night time and 77% of transition time (Figure 5.4), while sailfish II remained \n\nbetween 25\u00b0 and 28\u00b0C, for 77%, 73% and 74% of day, night and transition periods, respectively \n\n(Figure 5.4). Sailfish III spent more time in a bit cooler waters, with temperature ranging from \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n24\u00b0 to 27\u00b0C for 89% and 82% during day and night time respectively (Figure 5.4). Sailfish IV, in \n\nturn, had a similar behavior of sailfish I and II, remaining in waters with temperatures between \n\n25\u00b0 and 28\u00b0C for 90% of day time and 69% of night time (Figure 5.4).  \n\nThe cumulative depth and temperature frequencies plots are also similar for the \n\ntagged specimens indicating the species preference for surface layers, with temperatures ranging \n\nfrom 24\u00b0 to 28\u00b0C (Figure 5.5). Delta T frequency distributions showed that all sailfish spent the \n\nvast majority of their time in the uniform temperature surface layer, being exposed to a \n\nmaximum temperature change of ~8-10\u00b0 C (Figure 5.6). \n\nNone of the heterogeneity chi-square analyses using the G-test for the time at \n\ndepth distributions (44 total tests) provided significantly different results among periods for each \n\nfish, as well as for the data combined (data of all fishes). Likewise, none of the results of G-test \n\nfor time at temperature distributions (44 total tests) were significantly different among periods \n\nfor each fish, or for the data combined. Additionally, the resultant clustering dendrogram for \n\ndepth and temperature distribution showed some similarities between the analyzed specimens \n\nand periods (Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7).  \n\nThe depth readings by 3-hour (sailfish I e II) or 6-hour (sailfish III e IV) intervals \n\nduring the monitored time for all tagged sailfish (Figure 5.8; Table 5.2) show that, despite their \n\npreference for surface waters, all sailfish performed vertical movement into deeper waters \n\n(around 50 m depth) regularly within 3 or 6 hour interval (Figure 5.8). However, in general, \n\nsailfish I and III made shallower dives (around 50 m depth), when compared to sailfish II and IV, \n\nwhich frequently visited deeper depths, around 100 m. Furthermore, the two deepest dives made \n\nby sailfish I (120 m) were observed immediately after release (Figure 5.8, Table 5.2). For sailfish \n\nII the deepest observed dives reached 376 m, while sailfish III made its deepest dive at 112 m. \n\nSailfish IV presented, however, a much deeper dive, going down to 560 m (Figure 5.8, Table \n\n5.2). The depth records by period suggest that the average depths for all tagged sailfish were \n\nclose (approximately between 20 and 30 m depth), although sailfish IV had an average depth of \n\n46 m during night time (Figure 5.9, Table 5.2 ).  \n\nThe minimum and maximum daily temperature and depth experienced by the \n\ntracked sailfish (Figure 5.10, Figure 5.11and Figure 5.12) (except for sailfish IV) show that \n\nsailfish I spent most of the time in waters above 20\u00b0C (average depth of 40m) with only two \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\ndives on February 2th to waters with temperature of 16\u00b0C (120m, Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.10, \n\nTable 5.2). On the other hand, sailfish II experienced temperatures and depths much cooler and \n\ndeeper than sailfish I, with a minimum temperature value of 11.1\u00b0C during its deepest dive \n\n(376m) on February 25th (Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.11, Table 5.2 ).  Sailfish III, in turn, had a \n\nsimilar behavior of sailfish I, spending most of the time in waters above 23\u00b0C (average depth of \n\n40m), with two dives on November 25th to waters with temperature of 20\u00b0C (120m, Figure 5.8 \n\nand Figure 5.12, Table 5.2 ). Due to significant gaps on data transmission of the tag from sailfish \n\nIV this analysis could not be done for this specimen. However, it experienced the lowest \n\ntemperature of 12.40\u00b0C during its deepest dive at 560 m (Table 5.2).  \n\nAfter February 24th, and more specifically between February 25th and March \n\n10th, sailfish II presented minimum daily temperatures notably much cooler than the rest of the \n\ntracked period (Figure 5.11). This may indicate that the fish moved into a different and cooler \n\nwater mass. Depth-temperature profiles also provide indications that the sailfish II swam at least \n\nin two different water masses (Figure 5.13).The first water mass occupied by the sailfish II, prior \n\nto 25th February, was warmer and had a deeper mixed layer, while from 25th February to 10th \n\nMarch the fish occupied a cooler water mass with a shallower mixed layer (Figure 5.13). The \n\nother 3 fishes, however, were associated to only warmer water masses during their whole track \n\nwith apparently the same depth of mixed layer (Figure 5.13).  \n\nIn order to check if the depth behavior of sailfish II was different between the two \n\nwater masses, the depth distribution data were split into two distinct periods. The first one related \n\nto the time the fish was associated to the warmer water mass and the second one related to the \n\ncooler water mass. While in the warmer water mass, the fish spent 72%, 65% and 62% of the \n\nday, night and transition time, respectively, in the upper 10 m, in the cooler water mass, the fish \n\nspent 77%, 75%, 75% of the day, night and transition time in the same depth layer (Figure 5.14). \n\nMoreover, while in the warmer water mass sailfish II spent 20% of the time (three periods \n\ncombined) between 30 and 100 m depth, in the cooler water mass this percentage was only 7% \n\n(Figure 5.14). Furthermore, the maximum daily depths when the fish moved into the cooler \n\nwater mass were notably smaller (around 50 m depth) in comparison to the rest of tracked period \n\n(around 100m depth) (Figure 5.11). Nevertheless, the depth distribution of sailfish II in the two \n\nwater masses were not significantly different (G-test, p > 0.05).  \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Horizontal movements \n\nThe estimated parameters of KFTRACK model for all sailfish (Table 5.3), as well \n\nas the geolocation estimates (Figure 5.15 to Figure 5.18) indicate that the KFTRACK model was \n\nable to estimate a more reliable fish track than the manufacturer geolocation. The model \n\ncorrected the raw values of longitude and latitude, especially for latitude since some positions \n\nfell completely outside of the confidence area (i.e. 95% confidence interval estimated by the \n\nmodel) (Figure 5.15 to Figure 5.18). In the case of sailfish II, an extreme raw geolocation latitude \n\nposition (around 40\u00b0 N) was recorded, corresponding to the equinox (when the latitude error is \n\nmaximal) (Figure 5.16). Regarding the longitudes estimates, with a few exceptions, the raw \n\ngeolocations were placed outside of the confidence interval of the KFTRACK model (Figure \n\n5.16).  \n\nFor sailfish III all positions were completely outside of the expected since the raw \n\ngeolocations were positioned over the continent (Figure 5.17). The raw latitudes estimates were \n\nall outside of the confidence area while the longitude estimates lied reasonably inside it. This \n\nproblem was solved fixing the release and pop-up positions (Figure 5.17). For sailfish IV, despite \n\nthe light levels readings were not satisfactorily added to the model, due to the significant gaps in \n\ndata transmission, the KFTRACK model seems to have reasonably estimated the most probable \n\ntrack (Figure 5.18). The confidence area for longitude estimates was very narrow while for \n\nlatitude estimates the model fit much better, correcting, for example, an extreme raw latitude \n\nposition on the 30th day of liberty (Figure 5.18).  \n\nThe \u201cmost probable tracks\u201d suggest that all tagged sailfish did not move \n\nsignificantly away from the tagging site. Sailfish I moved southeastward away from the Brazilian \n\ncoast until the 7th day of liberty, presenting, after that, a westward movement towards Brazilian \n\ncoast until the pop-up event very close of the tagging site (Figure 5.15). Sailfish II moved \n\ntowards southeast farther away from Brazilian coast with the position of the first transmission \n\nalso relatively not too far from the tagging site (Figure 5.16). Sailfish III showed a kind of \n\nmeandering movement, with the position of the first transmission, however, being relatively \n\nclose to the coast (Figure 5.17). Sailfish IV moved first towards south, presenting, then, an \n\neastward movement farther away from the Brazilian coast, but returning towards the continent \n\nuntil the pop-up event (Figure 5.18).  \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n5.4. Discussion \n\n5.4.1. Tag performance \n\nIn the present study all sailfish lost their tags prematurely, on average, at around \n\n30% of the programmed attachment time. The results suggest that the pop-up event occurred \n\nwhile the fish were alive and not as a result of death followed by sinking. Besides, all tagged \n\nspecimens were large enough to carry a pop-up tag and were released in good condition, with the \n\nhooks being removed before release. The hypothesis of death due to the trauma resulting from \n\nthe interaction with the fishing gear is therefore unlikely. Moreover, estimates of post release \n\nsurvival also indicate that sailfish have a high survival rate after capture by pelagic longline \n\nfishing gears (Kerstetter and Graves, 2008), which is probably even more traumatic than the \n\nrecreational fishing gear used in the present case. According to Musyl et al (2011), probable \n\ncauses of tag failure and premature release include battery failure, antennae damage, increased \n\ndrag as a result of biofouling, infections and tissue necrosis around the tagging site and \n\ninterference on the frequency reserved to the ARGOS satellite system.  \n\nAlthough the exact reasons for the premature releases observed in this study are \n\nnot clear, the kind of the tagheads used and the site of tagging may have been a contributing \n\nfactor. The regular nylon tagheads, used in the present work, have a low retention rate (Musyl \n\nand Naughton, 2007). Besides, according to the same authors, in order to maximize the retention \n\ntime of the tags, the surface area of the tagheads should be increased and placed between \n\nadjacent interneural and neural spines (see Figure 5.2), near to the basis of the dorsal fin. All \n\nsailfish in this study, therefore, may have been tagged a little lower than the proper target area \n\n(see Figure 5.1).  \n\n5.4.2. Vertical distribution \n\nThe present results showed a marked preference of the tagged sailfish for the \n\nupper 10m of the water column during any time of the day. This pattern is consistent with \n\nprevious studies with acoustic and pop-up tags on sailfish in other parts of world (Hoolihan, \n\n2004; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Kerstetter and Graves, 2008; Chiang \n\net al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nThe tagged sailfish also seemed to have a rather narrow temperature distribution. \n\nDelta T results showed a marked preference of sailfish for the warmer waters of the mixed layer, \n\nwith all sailfish having spent less than 3% of their time in waters colder than 8\u00b0C relative to the \n\nchange in water temperature in relation to the surface temperature. Other studies have also \n\nshown a restricted temperature range for the species, in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Prince \n\nand Goodyear, 2006; Hoolihan et al., 2011).  \n\nThe clear sailfish preference for near-surface warm waters is shared by other \n\nistiophorid billfish as well, including the black marlin in the Coral Sea (Pepperell and Davis, \n\n1999; Gunn et al.,2003), Atlantic blue marlin (Graves et al., 2002; Kerstetter et al., 2003; Prince \n\nand Goodyear, 2006; Goodyear et al., 2008), Pacific blue marlin (Holland et al., 1990; Block et \n\nal., 1992), and striped marlin (Holts and Bedford, 1990; Brill et al., 1993).  \n\nThe present results also showed that the tagged sailfish did not exhibit much depth \n\nvariability in habitat use, although some variation was noticeable among individuals, as indicated \n\nby the cluster analysis. This pattern is consistent with the results reported for sailfish in Gulf of \n\nArabia by Hoolihan and Luo (2007). On the other hand, Goodyear et al. (2008), analyzing a \n\nlarge database of 51 pop-up tags deployed in Atlantic blue marlin, found a complex behavior of \n\nvertical habitat use for this species. Musyl et al. (2003) also reported a complex habitat \n\nutilization for bigeye tuna in the north Pacific ocean with a clear difference in its behavior \n\nbetween night and day.  \n\nAlthough the majority of the time spent by sailfish was restricted to warmer \n\nwaters near the surface, the data showed that this species is also capable of making frequent deep \n\ndives, exceeding depths between 50 and 100 m, with the deepest one having exceeded 500 m. \n\nThe depth and temperature histograms of time spent combined with the 3 or 6 hourly of \n\nmaximum depth and minimum temperature suggests that the movement between the surface and \n\ndeeper layers was relatively rapid. \n\nVertical movement patterns in large pelagic fish has been reported as very \n\ncomplex reflecting behaviors such as foraging, thermoregulation or predator avoidance (Brill and \n\nLutcavage, 2001). The sailfish dives observed in the present study may be related to an \n\nopportunistic feeding behavior. Although the pop-up tags technology does not allow the study of \n\nfeeding events, two particularities of the sailfish biology seem to support this hypothesis. The \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nfirst one, of physiological and anatomical nature, is related to the fact that sailfish, like other \n\nistiophorids, have a specialized eye/ brain heater organ, allowing these deeper dives (Block, \n\n1986). The second one is related to stomach content analyses done in the same region, which \n\nshow the presence of some mesopelagic species in their diet (Vaske-J\u00fanior et al., 2004; Vaske-\n\nJ\u00fanior, 2005). However, since the summarized pop-up data are not particularly useful for \n\ndiscriminating between different behaviors, these results need to be interpreted with caution. \n\nAnalysis of high resolution data are still needed in order to allow a better understanding of the \n\nvertical movements of the species in a finer scale (i.e. at each minute or even though at each \n\nsecond).  \n\nThe results of the present study also suggest that the ambient temperature might \n\nbe the dominant factor controlling the vertical distribution of the species. Sailfish II moved \n\nbetween two water masses with distinct thermal profiles and mixed layer depths, but after \n\nentering into the cooler water mass, the fish modified its depth behavior, reducing its average \n\nand maximum daily depth, the depth and frequency of dives and the time spent in deeper waters. \n\nTherefore, the depth of the mixed layer may be an important feature that might directly affect the \n\ndepth behavior of sailfish. However, other oceanographic features have also been shown to affect \n\nthe depth behavior of pelagic fishes. Prince and Goodyear (2006), for example, demonstrated \n\nthat the vertical distribution of sailfish and blue marlin is directly related to the amount of \n\ndissolved oxygen, which may act as a physical barrier to their vertical movement, at least in the \n\neastern side of the Atlantic. Considering, however, the much higher concentrations of dissolved \n\noxygen in the western side of this ocean, such influence is unlikely in the present case.  \n\nSome inferences regarding changes in catchability can be drawn from the vertical \n\ndistributions of sailfish. Based on present results, this species tends to spend more time in \n\nshallow waters. The average depth of the shallow-set longline used by the Brazilian longline \n\nfishery targeting swordfish is ~50 m. Thus, it is very likely that sailfish vertical distribution is \n\noverlapping with the longline gear off the southeastern Brazilian coast. However, it is difficult to \n\npredict catchability from electronic tagging data since no information exits regarding how \n\nbehavior may be altered by the presence of fishing gear.  \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n5.4.3. Horizontal movements \n\nIn general, sailfish has been recognized to be one of the istiophorid species that \n\npresents the most restricted movements in the Atlantic Ocean, as revealed by the release-\n\nrecovery vector of tagged recaptured fish, with no trans-Atlantic, trans-equatorial or \n\nintercontinental movements (Ortiz et al., 2003). However, significant movements were observed \n\nbetween the Straits of Florida and adjacent waters, and the Gulf of Mexico and the area near \n\nCape Hatteras (35\u00b0N) (Ortiz et al., 2003; Obersen et al., 2008). One of the main objectives of \n\nthis study was to determine the summer residence and migratory route of sailfish during and after \n\nthe spawning season off southeast Brazil. Unfortunately, the low number of tags deployed and \n\ntheir premature releases have left this question still unanswered.  \n\nHowever, the analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of catch rates and \n\nreproduction data (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 4)  have suggested a southward movement of the \n\nstock from October on, from the western central tropical Atlantic towards the southeast Brazilian \n\ncoast, in order to spawn. After spawning, the sailfish is probably driven northeastward in order to \n\nreturn to the tropical western central tropical Atlantic. Despite of the fact that the tagged sailfish \n\ndid not show this migration pattern, the rather short monitored time may have prevented that. \n\nBesides, it has been known that the capture of sailfish between April and September is atypical \n\noff southeast Brazilian coast, evidencing the species exit from this area.  \n\nOn the other hand, the results of the present work showed evidences that the \n\nresidence time of sailfish off southeast Brazilian during the spawning season might be extended \n\nuntil at least mid March. Information of conventional tagging also demonstrated a degree of \n\nfidelity of sailfish in southeast Brazilian coast during the spawning season peak. One sailfish \n\nwith a conventional tag was recaptured in the southeast Brazilian coast, close to one year after \n\nrelease and during the spawning period, very close to the tagging site (Amorim et al., 2011).  \n\nDespite the number of days and the amount of data obtained in the present work \n\nwere rather low, this study represents the first observations of vertical and horizontal habitat \n\nutilization of sailfish in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. As more tags are deployed additional \n\ninformation will be generated, helping to better describe the migratory movements of the sailfish \n\nstock and their relationship with important events of life cycle, such as spawning season in the \n\nAtlantic Ocean. In conclusion, the present results provide information into the biology of sailfish \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nin the southwestern Atlantic and how vertical distributions during the day and night are \n\ninfluenced by temperature. The diel variability of tagged individuals highlights the need for \n\ndetailed spatiotemporal studies linking habitat preferences to fisheries data.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 - Summary of depth and temperatures bins used to program the pop-up tags in \nthe present study. \n\nDepth (m) Temperature (\u00b0C) \n\n0-|10 12-|15 \n\n10-|15 15-|18 \n\n15-|20 18-|20 \n\n20-|30 20-|22 \n\n30-|40 22-|23 \n\n40-|50 23-|24 \n\n50-|75 24-|25 \n\n75-|100 25-|26 \n\n100-|150 26-|27 \n\n150-|200 27-|28 \n\n200-|250 28-|29 \n\n250-|300 29-|30 \n\n>300 >30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nTable 5.2  \u2013 Mean, minimum, maximum temperatures and depths with the respective \nstandard deviation experienced by tagged sailfish during the tracked period by fish and \nperiod. \n\nPeriod Fish \nMean \n\ntemperature \nMin \n\ntemperature \nMax \n\ntemperature \nStandard \nDeviation \n\nDay SAI I 25.06 16.30 27.10 1.85 \n\nNight SAI I 25.34 20.50 27.10 1.48 \n\nTransition SAI I 25.36 21.40 27.70 1.56 \n\nDay SAI II 24.16 14.80 28.00 2.77 \n\nNight SAI II 23.48 11.10 28.60 3.32 \n\nTransition SAI II 23.82 15.00 28.60 2.90 \n\nDay SAI III 24.08 20.10 26.80 1.15 \n\nNight SAI III 23.93 20.20 26.40 1.17 \n\nDay SAI IV 24.37 15.70 26.70 1.95 \n\nNight SAI IV 23.51 12.40 26.80 3.30 \n\nPeriod Fish Mean depth Min depth Max depth \nStandard \nDeviation \n\nDay SAI I 21.53 0 120 22.61 \n\nNight SAI I 18.10 0 72 19.49 \n\nTransition SAI I 19.42 0 72 19.17 \n\nDay SAI II 23.72 0 120 21.06 \n\nNight SAI II 29.18 0 376 30.72 \n\nTransition SAI II 26.41 0 160 24.78 \n\nDay SAI III 24.76 0 96 23.11 \n\nNight SAI III 26.33 0 112 23.91 \n\nDay SAI IV 23.33 0 112 23.63 \n\nNight SAI IV 46.11 0 560 79.80 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nTable 5.3 - Movement parameter estimates for tagged sailfish determined from the Kalman \nFilter state-space model (KFTRACK).

The response variable was the number of sailfish caught \n\nper number of boats registered in the tournament per day. The following factors were tested in \n\nthe analyses: \u201cyear\u201d, \u201cmonth\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d, representing the main effects of the \n\nexplanatory variables. Fishing effort is an offset term. The factor \u201carea\u201d was not significant and \n\nno interactions were included in the final model. The factor \u201cmonth\u201d explained the largest \n\namount of variation, followed by \u201cyear\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d. The proportion of the deviance explained \n\nby the model was about 0.35 (pseudo-R2). The diagnostic plots revealed that the model residuals \n\nare homoscedastic and model seems to be not biased. Residuals are approximately normally \n\ndistributed. Discrepancies between residual and standard normal distributions are small and \n\nappear only in the tails. Therefore, both negative binomial error distribution and link functions \n\nseemed to be acceptable. The overall pattern of the standardized catch rate indicates a relatively \n\nstable trend with a slight decline throughout the whole period. Despite these results conform with \n\nprevious findings, there were some discrepancies with previous standardization of sailfish catch \n\nrate in the southwestern Atlantic. This could be explained by the differences in the \n\nstandardization procedures, or even because the data sets are from different fleets.  \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\nBillfish sport fishing tournaments have a long history in Brazil. Since 1956, this \n\nactivity has been promoted mainly in the States of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, southeast \n\nBrazil. Nowadays, however, fishing tournaments are held along the entire Brazilian coast, \n\nalthough they are still largely concentrated off the coast of Cabo Frio, in Rio de Janeiro, in \n\nIlhabela, in S\u00e3o Paulo, and in Vit\u00f3ria, in Espirito Santo. The fishing season happens mainly from \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nOctober to February (spring/summer), with the blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), the white \n\nmarlin (Kajika albida) and the sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) being the main targeted species.  \n\nCatch and effort data from sport fisheries are an important source of information \n\non trends of fish stocks. Time series of catch rate have been frequently used in stock assessments \n\nfor large pelagic fishes, as an index of relative abundance. Such application, however, has been \n\nwidely debated (Maunder and Punt, 2004), since trends in catch rate can be influenced by many \n\nfactors in addition to stock abundance, including the fishing season, spatial variability of the fish \n\nstock, target species as response to changes in fishing gear, environmental conditions and \n\nfishermen\u2019s experience. Such variations may lead to significant changes in catchability, \n\nintroducing serious errors in the estimation of abundance indices (Fr\u00e9on and Misund, 1999). To \n\novercome this problem, the most common approach has been to standardize the catch rate, in \n\norder to remove the effects of other factors unrelated to stock abundance (Maunder and Punt, \n\n2004). This approach has been used widely in fisheries science, having become a crucial step for \n\naccurate stock assessments (Gulland, 1983; Maunder and Punt, 2004).  \n\nIn the Brazilian sport fishery, a number of changes in fishing grounds and target \n\nspecies, among others, which directly affect the catch composition, have been well documented \n\n(Arfelli et al., 1994; Amorim and Arfelli, 2001; Amorim and Silva, 2005). Thus, the use of \n\nnominal catch rates derived from this fishery as an index of relative abundance can lead to \n\ninterpretation errors, making its utilization rather complex. Hence, in the present chapter a \n\nnominal catch rate series of sailfish caught by the sport fishery in southern Brazil (1996-2008) is \n\npresented with the corresponding standardized values, for identification of the main factors of \n\ninfluence. \n\n6.2. Material and Methods \n\n6.2.1. Catch and effort data \n\nRadio logbook records from recreational tournaments of Yacht Clubs from S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo and Rio de Janeiro have been collected since 1996 by voluntary submission of the \n\ntournament organizers and by onboard observers. The data set included a total of 94 tournament \n\ndays, from 1996 to 2008. Records for each tournament day included boat names, total number of \n\noperating boats per tournament day, total number of fish hooked, and their fate (i.e. lost, \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\nreleased, tagged and released, or boarded), by species, as well as the size and weight of all \n\nboarded fish.  \n\n6.2.2. Modeling \n\nThe number of sailfish caught per number of boats recorded in the tournament per \n\nday (C) was considered as a relative index of abundance. The logarithm was used as a link \n\nfunction, in the following GLM model:  \n\n y ? log(C)  \n\n? ~ year + month + target + State + interactions + offset(log[fishing effort]) + ?  \n\nwhere the terms \u201cyear\u201d, \u201cmonth\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d and \u201dstate\u201d represent the main effects \n\nof the explanatory variables, while \u201cinteractions\u201d stands for the first order interaction between all \n\nmain effects. Fishing effort is an offset term and ? is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d) \n\nrandom variable with a negative binomial distribution. Despite the relatively low zero-count \n\n(~30%, Figure 6.1), the empirical distribution of C data was still too zero-inflated and over-\n\ndispersed to fit a traditional Poisson distribution (Figure 6.2). The negative binomial distribution, \n\nhowever, seemed to accommodate the data well (Figure 6.3) and was, for this reason, chosen to \n\nfit the models, using statistical software R 2.12.0 (R Development Core Team, 2010).  \n\nThe factor \u201cyear\u201d included data from 1996 to 2008, while \u201cmonth\u201d included only \n\ndata from October to February, since there is no tournament out of this period. The factor \n\n\u201ctarget\u201d was based in the target fish set for each tournament, including blue marlin or sailfish. \n\nThe factor \u201cState\u201d accounted for the tournaments carried out off S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro \n\ncoasts, in two different fishing areas about 90 miles from coast, as follows: A: 23\u00b0 to 24\u00b0S/41\u00b0 to \n\n42\u00b0W, for Rio de Janeiro; and B: 24\u00ba to 25\u00b0S/44\u00ba to 45\u00b0W, for S\u00e3o Paulo (Figure 6.4).   \n\nThe selection of predictors or interactions and the decision on their entry or \n\nexclusion was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1978) and the total \n\ndeviance explained. Chi-square tests were also computed to determine whether terms yielded \n\nsignificant (p &lt;0.05) reductions in the residual deviance upon entry into the GLM.  Finally the \n\nresidual distribution was checked in order to evaluate the goodness of fitted model. The \n\nestimates of standardized catch rate were based on the predictions obtained for each year, fixing \n\nhttp://??\nhttp://??\nhttp://??\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nthe level of remaining factors at the level with the highest number of observations. The standard \n\nerrors of estimates were also presented. \n\n6.3. Results \n\n6.3.1. Exploratory analysis \n\nThe fishing effort (calculated as number of tournament days monitored) ranged \n\nfrom 2, in 2006 to 11 in 2003 while the total catch including all species (marlins, tunas and other \n\nteleosts) reached from 20 in 2006 to 290 in 2007 (Figure 6.5). In general, the total catch, as \n\nexpected, followed the variation of fishing effort (Figure 6.5). The sailfish was the most caught \n\nspecies during the whole period, representing 75% of the total catch, followed by blue marlin \n\nwith 18% while tunas (Thunnus spp.) and white marlin had a small relative participation on the \n\ntotal catch (7%) (Figure 6.6). \n\nThe catch composition of the main species caught in the tournaments also varied \n\nwith year (Figure 6.7). The sailfish was the most caught species in almost all years, except for \n\n1998, when the blue marlin dominated the catches (Figure 6.7). Other species were also caught \n\nin much less numbers, including the white marlin and tunas (Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7). \n\n The means of sailfish nominal catch rate for each level of the factors are presented \n\nin Figure 6.8. The mean nominal catch rate was much larger for 2004, 2006 and 2007, with the \n\nlowest values being observed in the rest of the years. The monthly catch rate was much higher \n\nfor December and January than in other months (Figure 6.8). Expectedly, the sailfish catch rate \n\nwas usually higher when it was the main target of the tournament. The catch rate in Rio de \n\nJaneiro was always higher than in S\u00e3o Paulo (Figure 6.8). \n\n6.3.2. Standardization of catch rate \n\nTable 6.1 shows the deviance analysis of the selected model. The factor \u201carea\u201d \n\nwas not significant and no interactions were included in the final model. The factor \u201cmonth\u201d \n\nexplained the largest amount of variation, followed by \u201cyear\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d. The proportion of the \n\ndeviance explained by the model is about 0.35 (pseudo-R2). Estimations of the coefficients are in \n\nTable 6.2. Only coefficients for the years 1998 and 2000 were positive. Most the coefficients \n\nestimated for the factor \u201cYear\u201d were not significant though most of standard errors were bigger \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nthan the coefficients estimated. All estimations for \u201cMonth\u201d were negative (except December) \n\nand most of them were significant. Residual partial plots for all main factors seem to be well \n\ndistributed around zero (Figure 6.9). December and January were the most productive period for \n\nfishing sailfish. As expected, higher catch rates were observed when the sailfish was the target \n\nspecies of the tournament (Figure 6.9).  \n\nThe diagnostic plots revealed that the model residuals are homoscedastic and \n\napproximately normally distributed (Figure 6.10). Discrepancies between residual and standard \n\nnormal distributions are small and appear only in the tails (Figure 6.10). Therefore both the \n\nnegative binomial error distribution and the link functions seem to conform well to the data.  \n\nThe standardized catch rates and the standard error estimations (Figure 6.11) show \n\nthat the standard errors of estimates were relatively small, with the great majority being smaller \n\nthan the year coefficient estimations. The overall pattern of the standardized catch rate indicates \n\na relatively stable trend with a slightly decline throughout the whole period (Figure 6.11). The \n\nnominal catch rate, in turn, showed a different trend, with an apparent increase in values after \n\n2002, with one pronounced peak in 2004 (Figure 6.11).  \n\n6.4. Discussion \n\nAssuming that catch rates are proportional to the actual stock abundance implies \n\nthe acceptance of several assumptions related to the variation of the catchability coefficient. \n\nHowever, there are several limitations in this approach. Such constraints are particularly complex \n\nin the case of non-target species, such as billfishes in the pelagic longline fishery, which is \n\ncharacterized for high percentage of zero observations combined with few large catch values due \n\nto school aggregation, since some Istiophorid billfishes, like sailfish, often form schools in \n\nspecific locations (Nakamura, 1985). Catch and effort data from sport fishery tournaments, \n\ntherefore, may be a better alternative to estimate billfish catch rates.  \n\nComparatively, the present data set had an amount of zero-valued observations \n\nmuch lower (30%) than the commercial longline fishing (~75%, see Chapter 4 ), although, it was \n\nstill zero-inflated and left-skewed distribution to account with problems of overdispersion, when \n\nthe ratio of the residual deviance and the degrees of freedom is much higher than 1 (Zuur et al., \n\n2009). In the previous exploratory analysis, different statistical probability distributions that are \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nable to accommodate a high percentage of zero observations (i.e. Poisson and Tweedie) were \n\ntested. However, the negative binomial distribution appeared to be the best option to analyze the \n\nsailfish catch rate, with no evidence of overdispersion and the most satisfactory residuals \n\ndistribution. \n\nIn general, the trend of partial residuals estimated for each covariate followed the \n\nsignal of nominal catch rate mean values. For the season effect (i.e. month), December and \n\nJanuary were the most productive fishing period. In fact, sailfish catch rates are highly seasonal, \n\nsince it is very likely that mature sailfish migrate from the western central tropical Atlantic \n\ntowards the southeast Brazilian coast to spawn and remain in the area from about February to \n\nMarch. After spawning, sailfish probably depart in a north-east direction to return to the tropical \n\nwestern central tropical Atlantic (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 4). Regarding the target species \n\neffect, when the sailfish is the target, the yacht speed is less than when the boats are targeting \n\nblue marlins. The bait type also changes, depending on the species targeted, with a preference for \n\ndead, natural bait when the sailfish is targeted and artificial baits when the target species is the \n\nblue marlin.  \n\nThe final estimations of year effect showed that most of the estimated standard \n\nerrors are not larger than the coefficient estimations; hence we assumed the results are useful to \n\nevaluate the sailfish recreational fisheries status off the Brazilian coast. If the standardized catch \n\nrates are assumed to reflect well the local relative abundance of the stock, the results suggest that \n\nthe biomass of sailfish caught in southwestern Atlantic have suffered a very slight decline along \n\nthe studied years. Amorim et al. (2006) also reported catch rate indices calculated for sailfish \n\ncaught by tournaments of recreational fishery carried out in S\u00e3o Paulo State and found a similar \n\ntrend of standardized CPUE, which seemed to oscillate around a rather stable level, from 1996 to \n\n2004. Wor et al. (2010) analyzed catch and effort data from Brazilian longline fleet and \n\ndemonstrated a similar trend with a moderate decline between 1978 and 2008. Ortiz and Arocha \n\n(2004), in turn, reported a stable trend for sailfish caught by Venezuelan longline fleet in the \n\nCaribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.  \n\n \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nTable 6.1 - Deviance analysis of the fitted model for the standardization of sailfish catch \nrate caught by the Brazilian sport fishery in the Atlantic Ocean from 1996 to 2008.

The results of the last sailfish stock assessment carried out by ICCAT in 2009 \n\nindicated that both stocks are probably overfished, particularly the one from the eastern Atlantic. \n\nHowever, the analyses in this assessment were severely hampered by an acute lack of accurate \n\ndata (i.e. catch and effort data, ICCAT 2009). Moreover, the difference of recent trends in \n\nabundance among the different fleets, particularly after 1990, also suggested a high degree of \n\nuncertainty regarding the status of sailfish stocks in Atlantic (ICCAT 2009). Hence, despite of \n\nICCAT work group have recommended that the catches of western stock should not exceed the \n\ncurrent levels, no specific management or regulations were adopted.  \n\nThe absence of basic life history information (i.e. reproductive biology and \n\ngrowth parameters) has precluded the application of size or age-structured models in the past \n\nsailfish stock assessments in the Atlantic Ocean. The length at first sexual maturity estimated in \n\nthe present work, however, can be converted to age at first sexual maturity, being thus directly \n\napplicable to the next stock assessment. Additionally, this study also estimated various other \n\nimportant parameters, such as fecundity, as well as sex ratios stratified by area and season, which \n\nmight be useful to arrange sailfish catch statistics by sex. Furthermore, stratifying catches by \n\nlatitude during spawning and non-spawning periods could be useful to reduce the variances of \n\nabundance indices used in stock assessments. Future research, therefore, should include \n\nsimulation studies to explore the quantitative effects of sex stratification by season and area on \n\nstock assessments.  \n\nAnother aspect presented in this study was the spatial modeling of size at catch. \n\nSize-based indicators are progressively being used in fisheries management and could be a useful \n\ninstrument for monitoring sailfish stocks during periods when stock assessments are not \n\nconducted. Monitoring the mean length and catch rates of sailfish in the pelagic longline \n\nfisheries during the spawning season in the Southeast Brazilian coast, for example, may provide \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\nsome insight into the spawning stock biomass. Although there was no indication of a declining \n\nmean size of spawning sailfish in the studied area over the duration of the present investigation, \n\nlonger-term trends were not investigated.  \n\nThe present results also show that the inclusion of oceanographic variables in \n\ncatch rate standardization might provide a better understanding of the possible relationship \n\nbetween the fishing gear behavior and catchability, as a result of the physiological ecology of \n\nsailfish. Regarding the Brazilian catch rate series, despite the present results agree relatively well \n\nwith previous findings, there were some discrepancies between the available times series of \n\nsailfish catch rate in southwestern Atlantic. This could be explained primarily by the different \n\ndata sets used, but also by the diverse standardization procedures.  \n\nNew analysis, incorporating new variables, and the development of cooperative \n\nstudies could be useful to identify the causes of the differences between authors found so far. \n\nAlthough the present results are speculative, considering the rather limited amount of data used, \n\nthey provide an additional catch rate series to be taken into account when assessing the condition \n\nof the sailfish stock in the South Atlantic. Moreover, the hotspots identified in the present \n\nanalysis might serve as a basis for the delimitation of the explanatory variable \u201carea\u201d in the next \n\ncatch rate standardization procedures, considering also a possible interaction between area and \n\nmonth, since there is a strong correlation of these hotspots with summer months in the southeast \n\nBrazilian coast. \n\nThe understanding of the population structure of exploited species is one of the \n\nmain requirements for the proper delineation of fishery management units and consequently to \n\nan effective management and conservation of fisheries resources. In the last sailfish stock \n\nassessment the billfish working group concluded that there was a need to reevaluate the stock \n\nstructure for the species (ICCAT, 2009), in light of new biological information. Some questions \n\nstemming from that are: \n\n(1) Are South Atlantic sailfish a separate stock from North Atlantic sailfish?  \n\n(2) Are Southwest Atlantic sailfish a separate stock from Southeast Atlantic \n\nsailfish and North Atlantic sailfish?  \n\n(3) Do South Atlantic sailfish constitute a single stock unit? \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\nAccording to Gulland (1983), several classes of information should be considered \n\nin the delineation of stocks: (i) spatiotemporal discontinuities in fish abundance, as reflected in \n\ncatch rate by fishing vessels; (ii) location and timing of spawning; (iii) differences in population \n\nparameters, such as, growth and size structure; (v) tagging data; (iv) genetic differences. The \n\nprovision of new information on South Atlantic sailfish with regard to several of these categories \n\nwas the primary task of the present dissertation, as discussed in the previous chapters. \n\nSpawning areas for sailfish have been identified on the basis of gonad \n\nexamination and larval distribution in the Northwest in the Straits of Florida (Voss, 1953; Jolley, \n\n1974; Richardson et. al., 2009a and b) and Southeast coast of Brazil (Amorim and Arfelli, 1981; \n\nMourato et. al., 2009). On these grounds, it has been generally accepted that sailfish spawn in \n\nsummer in sub-tropical Atlantic waters centred on 20\u00b0N and 20\u00b0S. These spawning grounds are \n\nthus symmetrically distributed in the two hemispheres, with temporal separation of spawning \n\nseasons. On the other hand, spawning in the eastern Atlantic has been observed all year long with \n\na peak in April on the West African shelf (Ovchinnikov, 1971). Ueyanagi et al. (1970) reported \n\ntaking sailfish larvae off Angola and Sierra Leone between November to April. More recent \n\npreliminary information also suggests peak spawning of sailfish in the area of the Gulf of Guinea \n\nfrom October to December (ICCAT, 2009).  \n\n The geographical separation between Northern and Southern Hemisphere \n\nspawning grounds seems to be reasonably supported also by tagging data which have not shown \n\nany trans-equatorial movements. This information strongly suggests that South Atlantic sailfish \n\nand North Atlantic sailfish pertain to different populations. A possible separation of South \n\nAtlantic sailfish into two independent stocks, however, is not so clear. The main question \n\nremaining to be answered, thus, with regard to the Atlantic sailfish stock structure is: what is the \n\nlevel of connectivity between the southwestern and the eastern Atlantic sailfish? \n\nThe present results showed that, at least in part, the sailfish stock in the Atlantic \n\nOcean is structured longitudinally according to ontogenetic stages, reflected by environmental \n\npreferences of adults and juveniles or sub-adults. This fact combined with the existence of \n\ndiscrete non-overlapping of spawning seasons and southwestern and eastern Atlantic and a clear \n\ncontinuity of sailfish catch throughout the entire equatorial Atlantic basin, together with rather \n\nnarrow distance between the coast of Africa and the northeast tip of Brazil suggest that such a \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nlongitudinal mixing is highly likely. The analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of catch rates \n\nand reproduction data have suggested a southward movement of the stock from October on, from \n\nthe western central tropical Atlantic towards the southeast Brazilian coast, in order to spawn. \n\nAfter spawning, the sailfish is probably driven northeastward in order to return to the tropical \n\nwestern central tropical Atlantic.  \n\nThus, it is likely that some interchange does happen in the equatorial region \n\nbetween southwestern sailfish and eastern sailfish, particularly during the second and third \n\nquarters of each year. Moreover, the difference of the mean sailfish size between the \n\nsouthwestern and eastern Atlantic also might be an indication that sailfish after achieving the \n\nsexual maturity spawn for the first time in the western side, spawning in the eastern side from \n\nthat time onward. Although the separation of the northwest sailfish stock seems to be clear, there \n\nis still a large uncertainty about the degree of mixing between southwestern and eastern sailfish. \n\nShould it be considered a single stock for management purposes and what would be the impact \n\nof different stock structure scenarios in the results of the assessments are some of the questions \n\nthat still need to be answered. Based on the information then available, during the last \n\nassessment, ICCAT used the two stocks hypothesis (east and west) for Atlantic sailfish. In light \n\nof the information hereby presented, other alternative stock structure scenarios should also be \n\nconsidered in the next sailfish assessments to be carried out by ICCAT, although additional \n\nstudies, such as tagging studies, confirmation of timing and area of spawning in the eastern side \n\nof the Atlantic and genetic analysis are still needed to reduce the uncertainty in regard of sailfish \n\nstock structure in the Atlantic Ocean.  \n\nBycatch in pelagic longline fisheries represents the major source of fishing \n\nmortality for sailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean. In this context, the development of \n\nmanagement tools based on spatial analyses of the pelagic longline fisheries, such as time-area \n\nclosures might be a good option to decrease or to ensure appropriate levels of catches. Goodyear \n\n(1999), for example, demonstrated that time-area restrictions might significantly reduce the \n\nbycatch of billfishes in US pelagic longline fisheries with minor impacts on catch of target \n\nspecies. Evidently that the hotspots identified in the present work could be used to form the basis \n\nfor a time-area closure as a management tool for the sailfish population in the southwestern \n\nAtlantic Ocean. The overlap between peak commercial longline catches of sailfish off Southeast \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\nBrazil and peak spawning activity encourages careful consideration of management measures \n\nrequired to ensure that spawning stock biomass is fished at a sustainable level.  \n\nOn the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that hot-spot areas are consistent over \n\nyears (e.g. Watson et al 2008; Bigelow and Mourato, 2010) and thus additional research using \n\ncatch and effort data from different fleets (i.e. ICCAT data base) covering a broader area are still \n\nneeded to refine the highest density areas in Atlantic Ocean prior to definition of time-area \n\nclosures (e.g. Goodyear, 2003). Furthermore, the effectiveness of bycatch reduction measures \n\ninvolving time-area controls must also take in account the degree of overlap between the bycatch \n\nand target species and a possible reallocation of fishing effort, including socioeconomic aspects \n\nabout the nature and dynamics of the pelagic longline fishery (Goodyear 1999, 2003; Bigelow \n\nand Mourato, 2010).   \n\nAdditionally, other possible management measures that might also result in an \n\neffective reduction of fishing mortality of sailfish involve changes of fishing gear, such as the \n\nemployment of circle hooks (e.g. Kerstetter and Graves, 2008), which has proven to increase \n\nsurvival of the fish caught, followed by the mandatory release of specimens that are still alive at \n\nhaul-back. Another alternative to significantly reduce fishing mortality is to increase the hook \n\nfishing depths, since the present results showed a marked preference of the tagged sailfish for the \n\nupper 10m of the water column during any time of the day. Bigelow and Mourato (2010), for \n\ninstance, demonstrated that the redistribution of hook depth in Hawaii-based longline fleet \n\nsignificantly reduced the striped marlin catches with minor impacts on the catches of the target \n\nspecies, such as bigeye tuna.  \n\nFinally, the results obtained by the present study have presented new information \n\nthat might be used to establish new management measures aiming at ensuring the conservation of \n\nsailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean. \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nChapter 8 - References \nAkaike, H. 1974.
