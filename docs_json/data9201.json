BONALDO1 , Sidclay C. DIAS2 \n\nABSTRACT\nA preliminary survey of the spider fauna in natural and artificial forest gap formations at \u201cPorto Urucu\u201d, a petroleum/natural gas \nproduction facility in the Urucu river basin, Coari, Amazonas, Brazil is presented. Sampling was conducted both occasionally and \nusing a protocol composed of a suite of techniques: beating trays (32 samples), nocturnal manual samplings (48), sweeping nets \n(16), Winkler extractors (24), and pitfall traps (120). A total of 4201 spiders, belonging to 43 families and 393 morphospecies, \nwere collected during the dry season, in July, 2003. Excluding the occasional samples, the observed richness was 357 species. In \na performance test of seven species richness estimators, the Incidence Based Coverage Estimator (ICE) was the best fit estimator, \nwith 639 estimated species. To evaluate differences in species richness associated with natural and artificial gaps, samples from \nbetween the center of the gaps up to 300 meters inside the adjacent forest matrix were compared through the inspection of the \nconfidence intervals of individual-based rarefaction curves for each treatment. The observed species richness was significantly higher \nin natural gaps combined with adjacent forest than in the artificial gaps combined with adjacent forest. Moreover, a community \nsimilarity analysis between the fauna collected under both treatments demonstrated that there were considerable differences \nin species composition. The significantly higher abundance of Lycosidae in artificial gap forest is explained by the presence of \nherbaceous vegetation in the gaps themselves. Ctenidae was significantly more abundant in the natural gap forest, probable due \nto the increase of shelter availability provided by the fallen trees in the gaps themselves. Both families are identified as potential \nindicators of environmental change related to the establishment or recovery of artificial gaps in the study area. \n\nKEYWORDS: spider inventories, richness estimators, forest gaps, Brazilian Amazonia.  \n\nInvent\u00e1rio estruturado de aranhas (Arachnida, Araneae) em clareiras \nnaturais e artificiais em Porto Urucu, Amaz\u00f4nia Ocidental Brasileira\nRESUMO\n\nApresenta-se um invent\u00e1rio preliminar da fauna de aranhas em clareiras naturais e artificiais em \u201cPorto Urucu\u201d, uma instala\u00e7\u00e3o \nprodutora de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s natural na bacia do Rio Urucu, Coari, Amazonas, Brasil.

Um total de 4201 \naranhas pertencentes a 43 fam\u00edlias e 393 morfoesp\u00e9cies foi coletado durante a esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca em julho de 2003. Excluindo as amostras \nocasionais, a riqueza observada foi de 357 esp\u00e9cies. No teste de desempenho de sete estimadores, ICE (Incidence Based Coverage \nEstimator) gerou o melhor resultado, com 639 esp\u00e9cies estimadas. Para avaliar diferen\u00e7as na riqueza de esp\u00e9cies associadas a clareiras \nnaturais e artificiais, conjuntos de amostras do centro da clareira a at\u00e9 300 m adentro da floresta adjacente foram comparados atrav\u00e9s da \ninspe\u00e7\u00e3o dos intervalos de confian\u00e7a de curvas de rarefa\u00e7\u00e3o baseadas no n\u00famero de indiv\u00edduos de cada tratamento. A riqueza observada \nfoi significantemente maior nas clareiras naturais combinadas com as florestas adjacentes do que nas clareiras artificiais combinadas \ncom as matas do entorno. Al\u00e9m disso, uma an\u00e1lise de similaridade entre as faunas coletadas em ambos os tratamentos mostrou que \nexiste diferen\u00e7as consider\u00e1veis na composi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies.

BONALDO &amp; DIAS\n\nA structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and \nartificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia\n\nINTRODUCTION\nStructured inventories of spider communities have \n\nbeen implemented on a regular basis in Amazon Basin only \nrecently (Silva, 1992, 1996). Despite the fact that several \nsuch initiatives have been conducted in Brazilian Amazonia \nduring the last 10 years, only two papers dealing with spider \ncommunity structure have been published so far. Borges &amp; \nBrescovit (1996) provided data from two western Amazonian \nlocalities, The \u201cReserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentado \nMamirau\u00e1\u201d and \u201cBoca do Suma\u00fama\u201d, both near Tef\u00e9, State \nof Amazonas. H\u00f6fer &amp; Brescovit (2001) presented results of a \nlong term spider inventory carried out at the \u201cReserva Florestal \nAdolfo Ducke\u201d (RFAD), Manaus, Amazonas.\n\nPorto Urucu, the locality addressed in this paper, is \npractically unknown regarding the composition of its spider \ncommunities. Only six spider species from that area were \nrecorded in the literature so far. The Ctenids Centroctenus \nauberti (Caporiacco), Ctenus inaja Hofer, Brescovit &amp; Gasnier, \nCtenus villasboasi Mello-Leit\u00e3o, Cupiennius celerrimus Simon \nand Ancylometes rufus (Walckenaer) were reported by Brescovit \n(1996), H\u00f6fer et al. (1994), Brescovit &amp; Eickstedt (1995) and \nH\u00f6fer &amp; Brescovit (2000). A single species has Porto Urucu \nas its type locality, Rhoicinus urucu (Trechaleidae), described \nby Brescovit &amp; Oliveira (1994) on specimens collected \noccasionally in bromeliads during a floristic and herpetological \ninventory carried out in early 1990s. \n\nThe study area is located nearly 600 kilometers southwest \nManaus and harbors an oil/gas exploitation facility established \nin the 1980s. One of the most conspicuous results of this \nintervention is the creation of deforestation gaps in the \ndry land forest matrix to allow activities related to probing, \nestablishing and operating petroleum and gas wells. These gaps \nare opened for several specific purposes, such as helicopter \nlanding, drilling of wells and assembling of equipment for \noil/gas extraction and transferring. One of the most common \nkinds of artificial gaps in Porto Urucu is the so called \u201cJazidas\u201d \n(here termed JAZ gaps), represented by the gaps assigned \nfor the aerial deposit of soil and raw materials for highway \nconstruction, typically located near the margins of the roads. \nThese clear-cut, soil-compacted areas are probably the most \ndistinct artificial gaps in the study area. \n\nIn order to access the spider assemblages in both natural \nand artificial forest gaps, as well as in the dry land forest matrix \nadjacent to those gaps, we compared a set of high impacted \nJAZ gaps, each one from five to seven years in age, and a \nset of natural forest gaps, formed by the natural fall of old \ntrees. This paper reports a first attempt to describe the spider \ncommunities under these novel environmental conditions \nand provides the following preliminary data on the Urucu \nspider community structure as well as on the impact of oil/\ngas exploitation activities in the spider fauna of the study area: \n\n(1) a general checklist, including data on species composition \nobtained both occasionally and using a structured inventory; \n(2) a characterization of the differences in species richness \nand composition of the spider fauna present in both artificial \nand natural forest gaps formations; (3) comparisons between \nthe performance of several richness species estimators and; \n(4) suggestions of appropriate environmental indicator taxa \nfor both establishment and recovery of artificial gaps in the \nstudy area.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSTUDY AREA\n\n\u201cPorto Urucu\u201d is a 54000 ha petroleum/natural gas \nproduction unity in the right margin of Urucu River, Solim\u00f5es \nriver basin, State of Amazonas, Brazil (4\u00b0 53\u2019S, 65\u00b0 20\u2019W). \nRegional climate is classified as \u201cAfi\u201d by the K\u00f6ppen system, \nwith the rainy season between September and April, and the \ndry season between May and August (RADAM-BRASIL, \n1978). The main forest formation in Porto Urucu is \u201cterra \nfirme\u201d (dry land) associated with lowlands and plateaus as \ndescribed by Ribeiro et al. (1999) and cut by small creeks \n(\u201cIgarap\u00e9s\u201d), tributaries of the Urucu River. Three main creeks \nare located in the study area (Lontra, Tartaruga and Marta \ncreeks). Natural gaps are formations produced in the forest \nmatrix from fallen trees or large branches from the canopy, \nexposing the forest ground to direct solar radiation. The \nnatural forest gaps sampled were coded as NAT1 (04\u00ba 51\u201917.7\u2019\u2019 \nS, 65\u00ba 04\u201914.4\u2019\u2019W), NAT2 (04\u00ba 51\u201922.5\u2019\u2019 S, 65\u00ba 04\u201916.2\u2019\u2019W), \nNAT3 (04\u00ba 51\u201935.8\u2019\u2019 S 65\u00ba 04\u2019 16.7\u2019\u2019W) and NAT9 (04\u00ba \n53\u201942\u2019\u2019S, 65\u00ba 11\u201918\u2019\u2019W). All artificial forest gaps sampled \nwere originated from the construction or maintenance of the \nPorto Urucu road network, named JAZ 19 (04\u00ba 52\u201907\u2019\u2019S, \n65\u00ba 15\u201953\u2019\u2019W), JAZ 40 (04\u00ba 52\u201936\u2019\u2019S, 65\u00ba 09\u201905\u2019\u2019W), JAZ \n46 (04\u00ba 53\u201904\u2019\u2019S, 65\u00ba 09\u201912\u2019\u2019W) and JAZ 55 (04\u00ba 49\u201933\u2019\u2019S, \n65\u00ba 01\u201950\u2019\u2019W).  \n\nCOLLECTING\nThe data presented here were obtained in a single \n\nexpedition carried out in July, 2003. Five methods were used \nto access the spider fauna; pitfall traps, Winkler extractors, \nbeating trays, sweep-net and nocturnal hand searches, during \n13 days by three collectors. The samples were obtained from \nboth the center and the edge of a given forest gap, as well as \ninside the forest immediately associated with the gap, until \n300 meters from gap edge. The edge of a given forest gap was \nroughly defined as a ten meters wide band circling the gap. \nSweeping was performed only in the center of each forest \ngap and the nocturnal hand search was not applied in the \ngap edges. There was a total of 120 pitfall trap samples (60 \nin the natural forests gap and 60 in the artificial forests gap), \n\n\n\n 359 VOL. 40(2) 2010: 357 - 372  ?  BONALDO &amp; DIAS\n\nA structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and \nartificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia\n\n24 Winkler extractor samples (three by area), 32 beating tray \nsamples, 16 samples of sweep-net and 48 samples of nocturnal \ncollections, were obtained. Pitfall traps were used to access \nthe litter-dwelling spiders. Each trap, composed of a 500 ml \nplastic cup of 10cm diameter buried to the level of the soil, \nwas placed at least 5 meters apart one from another. Alcohol \n(80\u00b0 proof ) was used as the preserving liquid.  \n\nEstimateS software 7.5 (Colwell, 2006).  Differences in species \nrichness in both JAZ and NAT communities (defined as \nthose under the influence of either artificial or naturals forest \ngaps) were visualized through the inspection of the 95% \nconfidence intervals of individual-based rarefaction curves \ncalculated using EcoSim 7 (Gotelli &amp; Entsminger, 2001). \nKulczynski\u2019s (sensu Toti et al., 2000) and S\u00d8rensen\u2019s index of \nsimilarity were used to compare the composition of species \nin the two communities (Wolda, 1981; Krebs, 1999). To \ntest the normality of the abundance data of Ctenidae and \nLycosidae using the total sum of individuals (juveniles and \nadults) present in each JAZ and NAT samples, the Lilliefors \ntest was implemented in BioEstat 4.0 (Ayres et al., 2005). As \nthe Ctenidae data set was homocedastic and the Lycosidae one \nwas heterocedastic, Student\u00b4s T test and Mann-Whitney tests \nwere used respectively, also through BioEstat 4.0, to verify the \ndifferences in abundance of these families in both artificial \nand natural gap forests. \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION\n\nThe samples obtained in Porto Urucu from both natural and \nartificial forest gaps, together with those obtained occasionally in \nthe vicinities of the Lontra and Tartaruga creeks, produced 4201 \nspiders, belonging to 43 families. The most abundant family was \nCtenidae, with 714 specimens, followed by Araneidae, Lycosidae, \nTheridiidae and Salticidae, each one accounting for between \n400 to 500 individuals. These five families represented 58.3% \nof all spiders collected. Seven families were recorded by only \none specimen (Clubionidae, Dictynidae, Hahniidae, Idiopidae, \nNephilidae, Paratropididae and Tetrablemmidae) and three were \nrepresented by two specimens each (Cyrtaucheniidae, Hersiliidae \nand Palpimanidae) (see Fig. 1 for data on abundance per family). \n\nMethod\nGap Edge\n\nAdjacent \nforest Total\n\nNAT JAZ NAT JAZ NAT JAZ\n\nPitfall-trap 20 20 20 20 20 20 120\n\nWinkler extractor 4 4 4 4 4 4 24\n\nBeating tray - - 4 4 12 12 32\n\nSweep-net 8 8 - - - - 16\n\nNocturnal hand \nsearch\n\n12 12 - - 12 12 48\n\nTotal 44 44 28 28 48 48 240\n\nTable 1 - Sampling design applied to the structured inventory of spiders in \nnatural and artificial forest gap areas in Porto Urucu, Coari, Amazonas, Brazil. \n\nBeating trays were used to access shrub-dwelling spiders \nduring the day. Each beating tray was comprised of a 0,80m2 \ncotton white sheet. Nocturnal hand searches were modified \nfrom the \u201clooking up \u2013 looking down\u201d method proposed by \nCoddington et al. (1991). More detailed descriptions of these \nmethods are avaliable in Coddington et al. (1991) and Brescovit et \nal. (2002, 2004). The samples combined across each methodology \nwere the results of: one pitfall trap exposed by 10 days, one square \nmeter litter (sifted and included in Winkler extractors for 3 days), \none hour of beating per collector, one hour of sweeping per \ncollector and, one hour of nocturnal hand search per collector, \ninside an area of 300m2. To improve the taxonomic list of the \nstudy area, we also performed occasional samplings in the margins \nof the Lontra and Tartaruga creeks. These occasional samplings \nwere carried out using time-independent foliage beating during \nthe day and time and area-free hand searching at night. Voucher \nspecimens were deposited in the arachnological collections of \nMuseu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi, Bel\u00e9m (MPEG).\n\nSTATISTICAL PROCEDURES\n\nSample intensity (SI) was defined as the ratio of adults \nto species (Coddington et al., 1996). Seven non-parametric \nestimators of species richness (Chao 1, 2, Jackknife 1, 2, \nBootstrap, ACE and ICE) were used in order to verify which \nrichness estimators fit best to the present data set. Detailed \ndescriptions of these algorithms are available in Colwell &amp; \nCoddington (1994), Toti et al. (2000) and Colwell (2006). To \nreduce the influence of the sample order, 100 randomizations \nof sample sequence were made for each sample increment \n(Coddington et al. 1996). This analysis was performed using \n\nFigure 1 - Number of individuals per family collected in Porto Urucu, Coari, \nAmazonas, Brazil. Families with less than 20 individuals were grouped as \n\u201cothers\u201d.\n\n\n\n 360 VOL. 40(2) 2010: 357 - 372  ?  BONALDO &amp; DIAS\n\nA structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and \nartificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia\n\nConsidering only the adult spiders collected, the number \nof families represented in the samples decreases to 37, as \nIdiopidae, Paratropididae, Tetrablemmidae (represented by \nsingletons), Cyrtaucheniidae (two individuals), Gnaphosidae \n(five) and Zodariidae (11) were represented only by \nunidentifiable juveniles. The observed richness was 393 species \nor morphospecies, represented by 1612 adults (38.3% of \nall spiders collected). From all the recognized species, only \n47 were identified to species level, highlighting the poor \ntaxonomic knowledge of the Western Brazilian Amazonia \nspiders. Only four of these species were previously reported to \noccur in Porto Urucu. Two remaining species reported to the \nstudy area in the taxonomic literature, Cupiennius celerrimus \nand Rhoicinus urucu, were not re-collected.  \n\nThe sampling intensity was only four individuals per \nspecies, a low value when compared with the figures obtained \nin structured inventories in North America (e.g. Coddington \net al., 1996, Appalachian Mountains, SI = 18.3) and Europe \n(e.g. Scharff et al., 2003, Denmark, SI = 132). However, low \nsampling intensity values are common in inventories carried \nout in tropical sites, such as those reported by Coddington et \nal. (1991) (Bolivia, three localities, SI &lt;5), and even in some \n\nsub-tropical sites, as reported by Bonaldo et al. (2007) (State \nof Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; SI = 10.4, but inflated by the \ninclusion of identifiable juveniles in the calculation; SI = 8.8, \nexcluding the identifiable juveniles and few species identified \nonly by juveniles). The number of species represented by \nsingletons was 167. Thus, the inventory completeness, defined \nby Coddington et al. (1996) as the percentage of species \nrepresented by singletons, is still high (42.5% of all recognized \nspecies). This is another indication that this preliminary \ninventory is far from complete.  \n\nIn terms of number of species, the richer families were \nTheridiidae (68 spp.), Salticidae (60 spp.) and Araneidae (57 \nspp.), confirming the general pattern observed in Neotropical \necosystems (Silva, 1992). Table 2 depicts the species and \nmorphospecies recorded in Porto Urucu, with the number of \nindividuals collected by sampled area. The occasional sampling \nin the Igarap\u00e9s Marta and Tartaruga added 36 species to the \nlist, mainly representatives of Pholcidae and Trechaleidae.

To \nprovide an indication of the total species richness present in \nthe study site, the results of seven species richness estimators \nare made available for entire Porto Urucu dataset (Fig. 2). The \nestimates ranged from 662 species (Jackknife 2) to 435 species \n(Bootstrap). However, these results must be viewed cautiously \n\nbecause the inventory is not complete. Walther &amp; Moore \n(2005) stressed that each estimator has been developed to work \nbest under the assumptions defined by a specific population \nmodel, which defines the population structure resulting from \nvarious community parameters. Thus, performance tests \nalways must be carried out in order to verify which estimator \nfits best to the particular conditions of each inventory. \n\nToti et al. (2000), in testing a spider assemblage\u2019s database, \nindicated that a good way to test the performance of a given \nestimator is to inspect visually the shape of the curve, looking \nfor trends toward the asymptote.

In the \ncase here presented, no estimator reached a clear asymptote; \nbut after applying the above procedure, we verified that ICE \nwas the best fit estimator to this data set, characterized by \nlarge numbers of singletons and uniques. ICE (incidence-\nbased coverage estimator) is based on the proportion of \nspecies presented in the samples, relies on presence/absence \ndata to quantify rarity and retrieves information from species \nrepresented by up to 10 individuals (Toti et al., 2000; Colwell, \n2006). The preferred estimated number, produced by ICE, \nwas 639 species. This is the second larger estimate, being \nsurpassed only by Jackknife 2. However, it is not an absurd \nprediction because the only spider inventory from a nearby \nlocality available to comparison, the one provided by H\u00f6fer \n&amp; Brescovit (2001) for the RFAD, reported an observed (or \nminimal) species richness of 506 species. \n\nInspecting the individual-based rarefaction curves for \nboth JAZ and NAT communities (Fig. 3) at the point that \na comparison is possible (565th individual added), JAZ \naccumulated 196 species, while NAT accumulated 228 \nspecies. These differences are significant given the calculated \nconfidence interval (?= 0.05). The rarefaction curve for \nNAT reached a higher species richness with fewer specimens \nthan the JAZ curve, which needed to add 712 individuals to \naccumulate only 224 species at the end of data entry. \n\nThe values of the similarity indices for the JAZ and \nNAT communities were 0,34 and 0,48 for Kulczynski\u2019s and \nS\u00f8rensen\u2019s indexes, respectively. At the end of the observed \nsample-based accumulation curves, the samples related to \nnatural forest gaps produced 239 species, while 230 species \nwere recorded from the samples related to artificial forest \ngaps. Despite this apparently similar observed richness, only \n112 species were common to these two treatments. Both \n\nindices above depicted considerable differences regarding \nspider species composition between these two communities. \nThe differences between the two kinds of communities were \ndetectable, even considering that the collecting effort was less \nintense in the center of both kinds of gaps than in its forested \nedges and adjacent forest matrix. In the natural forest gaps \nof Porto Urucu, the composition of the plant communities \ndoes not differ greatly from that of the original forest matrix, \nbut the artificial forest gaps present more herbaceous and \npioneers plants (Lima Filho et al. 2001). It is possible that the \ndifferences depicted in species richness and composition of \nspecies among the two spider communities reflect responses \nto differences in physiognomy and plant species composition \nof the gaps themselves, revealing a differential influence of the \npresence of each kind of gap in the forest matrix. \n\nLYCOSIDAE AND CTENIDAE AS ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS   \n\nComparing the families represented by more than 400 \nindividuals (Fig. 4), a Mann Whitney test analyzing differences \nin abundance of Lycosidae in natural versus artificial forest gaps \nareas show that representatives of this family are much more \nabundant in JAZ areas than in NAT areas (U= 0; p= 0.0209). \nOn the other hand, T test show that Ctenidae was more \nabundant in NAT than in JAZ areas (t= 3.289; p= 0.0166).\n\nThe great abundance of Ctenidae in NAT areas could be \nexplained by a putative increase of suitable ground shelters \nfor these spiders, provided in the center of the NAT gaps \nby the fallen trees. In fact, the gap centers contributed 202 \nindividuals out of the 395 collected in NAT areas (51%). \nHowever, the results of the T test could be biased by the rarity \nof Ctenidae in the center of the JAZ gaps (only 31 out of all \n179 individuals in JAZ, or 17%).\n\nFigure 2 - Observed sampling accumulation curve and non parametric \nestimator performance for the data set of spiders collected in both artificial and \nnatural forest gap areas in Porto Urucu, Coari, Amazonas, Brazil.

BONALDO &amp; DIAS\n\nA structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and \nartificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia\n\nThe large number of representatives of the family Lycosidae \n(N= 432) is an unusual result for tropical rain forest sites. \nFrom all individuals collected in Porto Urucu, 417 were from \nJAZ communities and only 15 were from NAT areas or from \nthe surroundings of the creeks. Moreover, except for eight \nspecimens from the adjacent forest matrix, all specimens of \nLycosidae obtained in JAZ areas were collected in the gaps \nthemselves. Jocqu\u00e9 &amp; Alderweireldt (2005) stated that lycosids \nare consistently more abundant in areas covered by herbaceous \nlayer, which is negatively correlated with the degree of canopy \nclosure. In Porto Urucu, the natural forest gaps are surrounded \nby the primary forest and the canopy discontinuity is small. \nOn the other hand, the artificial forest gaps represent a large \ncanopy discontinuity, where in some areas, only herbaceous \nplants are present. \n\nThe explosive abundance of Lycosidae in artificial gaps, \ncombined with its extreme rarity in the wider forest matrix \nqualifies it as an excellent environmental indicator of forest \ndegraded areas. The incidence and relative abundance of \nCtenidae could be also monitored, providing a complementary \nindicator of recovering gap areas. \n\nRESEARCH PERSPECTIVES IN PORTO URUCU\n\nThe continuity of the project \u201cDin\u00e2mica de clareiras sob \nimpacto da explora\u00e7\u00e3o petrol\u00edfera\u201d (DICLA), which aims to \naddress some fundamental questions involving community \ndynamics in artificial gaps in Porto Urucu, allowed us to \nconsiderably increase the sampling effort in the study area. \nSince 2005, further studies on the spider fauna were carried \nout as part of the second author's PhD project. This project \napplied a sampling protocol designed to maximize the \nacquiring of data related to spider fauna dynamics in artificial \nforest gaps with various degrees of regeneration, grouping gaps \nin three blocks, each one with high sample representation \n\nlevels. Several occasional and fogging samples, as well as \nnearly 800 samples from a protocol composed by beating tray, \nnocturnal hand search and Winkler extractors, are available \nfrom this study. Adding information from these samples to the \npresent dataset may help to better quantify the environmental \nimpact of the artificial gaps in the spider communities present \nin the forest matrix of Porto Urucu.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nLogistic support in the field was provided by Petrobras \n\nS.A.; we are grateful to M.B.
