During the Palaeogene, the Sado Basin was a closed basin in which the \nmineralogy of the primary facies underwent significant changes that resulted in \nthe extensive occurrence of palygorskite. The Palaeogene fill of the Sado basin \nis composed by reddish coarse detrital sediments (conglomerates, arkosic \nsandstones, clays and marly carbonates). 28 samples representative of the \nmost exposed outcrops of these units were collected and analysed by XRD, \nXRF and SEM-EDS for their mineralogical and chemical characterization. SEM-\nEDS was used to compute the crystallochemical formulas for the identified clay \nminerals. Clay minerals associations were used as lithostratigraphical markers \nas well as for paleoenvironmental reconstructions and diagenesis analyses. \nPalaeogene deposits are characterized by an increase on palygorskite relative \namounts in the distal parts of the basin as well as by higher  structural order of \nthe clay minerals in the Miocene sediments and lower structural order in \nEocene sediments, pointing to a significant diagenesis contribution. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\npalavras-chave \n \n\nMinerais argilosos, paligorskite, an\u00e1lise de bacias, reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o \npaleoambiental, marcadores litoestratigr\u00e1ficos, diag\u00e9nese. \n\nResumo \n \n\nOs dep\u00f3sitos terci\u00e1rios da Bacia do Sado (no sudoeste de Portugal) \ncomtemplam quatro principais unidades litoestratigr\u00e1ficas que resultam de uma \ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00edpica de uma bacia continental. Durante o Paleog\u00e9nico, a Bacia do \nSado era uma bacia fechada em que a mineralogia da f\u00e1cies prim\u00e1ria passou \npor mudan\u00e7as significativas, que resultou numa extensa ocorr\u00eancia de \npaligorskite. O preenchimento paleog\u00e9nico da bacia do Sado \u00e9 composto por \nsedimentos avermelhados detr\u00edticos grosseiros (conglomerados, arcoses, \nargilas e margas). Foram colhidas 28 amostras representativas dos \nafloramentos mais expostos das referidas unidades litoestratigr\u00e1ficas e \nanalisadas, do ponto de vista mineral\u00f3gico e qu\u00edmico, por DRX, FRX, \nrespectivamente. Recorreu-se a an\u00e1lises SEM-EDS para calcular as f\u00f3rmulas \ncristaloqu\u00edmicas para os minerais argilosos identificados. Os resultados obtidos \npermitiram estabelecer associa\u00e7\u00f5es mineral\u00f3gicas para cada unidade, \nprincipalmente no que concerne os minerais argilosos. Estas associa\u00e7\u00f5es \nforam interpretadas como marcadores litostratigr\u00e1ficos e possibilitaram a \nreconstru\u00e7\u00e3o paleoambiental e an\u00e1lise diagen\u00e9tica da bacia do Sado. De \nforma geral, os dep\u00f3sitos paleog\u00e9nicos que preenchem a Bacia do Sado s\u00e3o \ncaracterizados por um incremento na quantidade relativa de paligorskite no \nsentido proximal-distal, bem como por um aumento da ordem estrutural dos \nminerais de argila na mesma unidade litoestratigr\u00e1fica, o que aponta para uma \ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o diagen\u00e9tica relevante. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n1.

Introduction \nStratigraphic interpretation using clay-mineral analysis can be made when the \n\ndiagenetic influence on clay mineralogy remains low. The spatio-temporal \n\ndistribution of detrital clay minerals in sedimentary successions may provide \n\ninformation on the environmental conditions of the source areas such as climate  \n\nlithology and soils composition (Adatte and Bolle, 2001; Alcal\u00e1 et al., 2001; Ruffell \n\net al., 2002; Dou et al., 2010), relative sea-level changes (Daoudi et al., 1995; \n\nMoon et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2009), and tectonics (Enu, 1986; \n\nMart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2001). This distribution can indicate the proximity to the \n\nsource area (Thiry and Jacquin, 1993; Clark et al., 2009), with implications for \n\npalaeoenvironmental modeling. Stratigraphic changes in the abundance of \n\nsmectite, kaolinite, and illite allow assessments of relative proximal\u2013distal \n\nvariations. \n\nThe analysis of the clay mineral associations' provides important information on \n\npaleoclimatic studies essentially concerning regional data. The composition of \n\ndetrital mineral associations is particularly useful in the way that they record the \n\nmodifications that occur in source area, in what concerns the erosion conditions \n\n(Rocha et al., 2005). \n\nPalygorskite is relatively rare in nature; however, its origins has been studied \n\nfrequently owing to the unique conditions required for its formation and stability, \n\nand the need to find new commercial deposits. According to Callen (1984), major \n\ndeposits of palygorskite were formed in three different environments: (1) in \n\nepicontinental and inland seas and lakes as chemical sediments or by \n\nreconstitution of former sedimentary clays; (2) in the open ocean in association \n\nwith fore-arc basins and ocean ridges by hydrothermal alteration of basaltic glass, \n\nvolcaniclastic sediments or existing clays; and (3) in calcareous soils by direct \n\ncrystallization. With respect to their geotectonic setting, neoformed palygorskite \n\nand sepiolite are predominant in shallow shelf basins on passive margins or \n\nintraplate basins. Continental rift basins, continental \u201csag\u201d basins or some \n\nperimarine basins, tend to contain significant deposits of these minerals, \n\ncommonly formed in saline or hypersaline conditions  Merriman, 2005). \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n2 \n \n\nAccording to Singer (1984), palygorskite in soils is associated with one of the \n\nfollowing conditions: (i) modern soils that, at present or in the past, were affected \n\nby rising groundwater of pH 7\u20138 and high salinity; (ii) in soils with distinct and \n\nsharp textural transitions because these minerals accumulate in the coarse \n\nfraction (this group includes many palaeosols); and (iii) in calcretes (caliches). In \n\nall these cases, palygorskite (and very rarely sepiolite, when Al is absent or \n\nimmobilized) is precipitated by evaporation of the vadose water (Jones and Weir, \n\n1983). Soils (duricrusts) can be cemented by palygorskite named palycretes \n\n(Rodas et al., 1994). \n\nThe present research project was executed under the title, \u201cPaleoenvironmental \n\nand stratigraphic reconstruction of Sado Basin (Portugal)\u201d. This research work was \n\ncarried out for the fulfillment of International Master in Advanced Clay Science \n\n(IMACS) degree. This thesis is the outcome of findings of fieldwork and laboratory \n\ninvestigations to decipher the paleoenvironmental model and marking of \n\nstratigraphic boundaries in the tertiary sedimentary sequence of the Sado basin, \n\nPortugal, using clay minerals assemblage as a valuable tool. This work has been \n\ndivided into two parts. First part is focused on the the marking of stratigraphic \n\nboundaries between different sedimentary units and second part is concerned \n\nabout the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental model and mechanism of genesis \n\nof palygorskite in Sado basin. Pimentel, N.L.V. carried out detailed \n\nsedimentological work on tertiary sequence of Sado Basin in his PhD work \u201cThe \n\nSado Tertiary Basin. Sedimentological and tectono-sedimentary analysis\u201d (PhD \n\nThesis, 1997, University of Lisbon). It also includes the work done before in the \n\nstudied area. We have tried to refine his results by establishing proximal-distal \n\nfacies, marking different lithostratigraphic units as well as giving more detailed \n\ninsights into clay minerals variations and their relationship. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n3 \n \n\n2. Framework of the study area \n\n2.1.  Location \nThe study area falls in the southwestern part of Portugal (Fig.1). The Sado Basin is \n\nbounded by the Messejana\u2013Plasencia Fault and by two WNW\u2013ESE late \n\nHercynean reactivated faults, the Torrao and Grandola Faults (TF and GF, Fig. 2). \n\n \n\nFig. 1- Location of Sado Basin (in brown) and sampling sites (marked with circles) \n\nin Portugal. \n\n2.2.  Geology and tectonics \nThe Sado Basin is a small Tertiary basin, located in the southwestern area of the \n\nIberian Peninsula, which was in connection with the larger Lower Tagus basin (Fig. \n\n2). The formation and tectono-sedimentary evolution of these basins are related to \n\nthe relative movements between the African and the European lithospheric plates, \n\nduring the alpine orogeny (Tapponier, 1977; Boillot et al., 1984; Uchupi, 1988; De \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n4 \n \n\nGaldeano, 1996). The convergent movement of those plates started in the \n\nPalaeocene, leading to intense deformation in the western Mediterranean, but only \n\nin the Eocene the compression was transmitted further west into the Iberian \n\nMassif. Here, the N\u2013S compression reactivated several originally late Hercynean \n\nfaults, most of them as NE\u2013SW strike-slip sinistral faults. Several tertiary iberian \n\nbasins were then formed, such as the Tagus\u2013Sado Basin between the Portuguese \n\nCentral System and the Messejana\u2013Plasencia Fault (MPF, Fig. 2). The \n\nMessejana\u2013Plasencia Fault and the two WNW\u2013ESE late Hercynean reactivated \n\nfaults (Torrao and Grandola Faults) acted mainly as dip-slip faults, forming a small \n\ngraben between them, in relation to the first Middle Eocene compressive phases. \n\nThe sedimentary response was the infilling by thick alluvial fan deposits (Vale do \n\nGuizo Formation). During the Oligocene and Early Miocene, with the rotation of the \n\nmain compression from NE\u2013SW  towards E\u2013W (De Galdeano, 1996), subsidence \n\nwas attenuated and active sedimentation stopped in this basin, restricting the \n\nNeogene sedimentary record to less than 40 m of Messinean fluvio-marine \n\ndeposits and Piacenzian fluvial sands (Pimentel, 1998b). The Neogene deposits \n\nlie unconformably and cover most of the Palaeogene, mainly at the SW half of the \n\nbasin, reducing the outcrops for study. The Palaeozoic basement lies at altitudes \n\nbetween +100 m and -250 m, showing a general dip towards the SW (with several \n\nsmall horsts and grabens), accompanied by an increasing thickness of the \n\nPalaeogene sequence, from about 20 m (near the Torrao Fault) to a maximum of \n\n250 m (near the Grandola Fault). There are strong evidences for a syn-\n\nsedimentary origin of this dip, namely the presence at the SW border of the Basin \n\nof porphyritic basic clasts\u2014with indubitable provenance from the igneous areas \n\nforming the footwall of the Torrao Fault to the NE (Pimentel, 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nFig.2- Location of Sado Basin in Iberian Peninsula. \n\n2.3. Climate \nAccording to K\u00f6ppen (1936) classification, the studied area has temperate climate \n\nwith warm summer (CSa).

Field Work Program \nField work was carried out in two steps. First field campaign was done in order to \n\nhave a broader view of the area.

Wet sieving \nWet sieving was performed to separate the silt-clay fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m) from the \n\nbulk material. Through the weighting of the obtained fractions, it was also used to \n\nassess the particle size distribution of the bulk materials. The method was \n\ndeveloped according to the standard test for particle-size analysis of soils (ASTM, \n\n2007). After mixing the bulk sample with distilled water, a #230 washing sieve (63 \n\n\u00b5m) was placed over a bucket and portions of the suspended sample were \n\ntransferred to the sieve.  \n\nThe fine clay was washed through the screen using a squirt bottle, until the wash \n\nwater was clean. The obtained fractions, silt-clay (&lt;63 \u00b5m) and sand-gravel (> 63 \n\n\u00b5m), were dried (50oC) and after cooled, they were weighted. \n\nThis method was used, rather than dry sieving, because for material that is finer \n\nthan 150 \u00b5m, dry sieving can be significantly less accurate. Wet sieving also \n\nproduces an adequate degree of separation between individual fractions. \n\nSuspending the particles in a suitable liquid allow the transport of fine material \n\nthrough the sieve much more efficiently than shaking the dry material. \n\nFurthermore, it allowed the gentle removal of cementing minerals and particles of \n\nhigher size. These could represent impurities in the material to be studied, \n\ncompromising its quality. \n\n3.2.2.  Sedimentation \nClay fraction was obtained from silt-clay fraction using sedimentation according to \n\nStokes law. The time for particle settling can be calculated using the following \n\nequation (Eq. 1): \n\n (Eq. 1) \n\nWhere, \n\nt \u2013 time, s; \n\nh \u2013 height of water column, m; \n\ng \u2013 gravitational acceleration, m/s2; \n\nD \u2013 equivalent spherical diameter, m; \n\n?p \u2013 mass density of particle, kg/m\n3; \n\n?f \u2013 mass density of fluid, kg/m\n3; \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n16 \n \n\n? \u2013 dynamic viscosity, kg/m\u00b7s. \n\n \n\n Table 2 indicates the sedimentation time for a water column of 10 cm and \n\nparticles equivalent spherical diameter 2 \u00b5m for different temperatures. \n\n \n\nTable 2- Time and temperature for 2 \u00b5m particles sedimentation. \n\nTemperature, oC Time, hh:mm:ss \n\n15 8:47:39 \n\n16 8:33:42 \n\n17 8:20:41 \n\n18 8:08:07 \n\n19 7:56:02 \n\n20 7:44:24 \n\n21 7:33:13 \n\n22 7:22:03 \n\n23 7:11:48 \n\n24 7:01:34 \n\n25 6:52:15 \n\n \n\nThe sedimentation procedure was carried out as follows: 20 grams of dried less \n\nthan 63 \u00b5m fraction was suspended in 1000 ml of distilled water using ultra-sound \n\nand passed to cylinders (illustrated in Fig. 7). The uppermost 10 cm column of \n\nsuspension was collected after a time period as given in the above table. When \n\nnecessary, antifloculant was added to the suspension. Then, the collected \n\nsuspension was put in the stove to dry at 50oC. The procedure was performed \n\nseveral times until the water became clean or the necessary amount of the less \n\nthan 2\u00b5m fraction was obtained. The dried sample was grinded in agate mortar \n\nand stored for further analyses. \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n17 \n \n\n \n\nFig.7- Cylinders used for sedimentation. \n\n3.2.3.  Mineralogical analysis \n\n3.2.3.1. X-ray diffraction \nCrystalline phases in samples were determined using X-ray diffractometer (XRD). \n\nPowder x-ray diffractogram was obtained for fraction &lt;63 \u00b5m. Clay fraction was \n\ncharacterized by preparing oriented slides, which were later treated with glycerol \n\nand heated for 500o C. The scanning was performed form 4o to 65o 2?, step 0,02o, \n\nscanning speed 0,02o/s. Sample was analysed using X'Pert-Pro \n\nMPDPhilips/PANalytical X-ray diffractometer (CuK?; ? = 1.5405 \u00c5) operating at 50 \n\nkV and 30 mA. In the case of clay fraction the scanning was performed from 4o to \n\n20o. The identification and semi-quantification of peaks was done manually using \n\nrecommendations and given data of Brindley and Brown (1980). \n\n3.2.3.2. Scanning electron microscope \nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a useful technique to study mineralogical \n\nand textural composition of clay minerals. SEM was used to ascertain the minerals \n\nfound in diffractograms. It was also applied to ascertain the chemical composition \n\nof specific mineral phases. \n\nThe parameters, which influence the image quality are accelerating voltage, beam \n\ncurrent and probe current, Bias voltage, working distance, spot size, diaphragm \n\nsize and aperture (Brisset, 2008). In our study, we used a Hitachi S-4100 \n\nScanning Electron Microscope. Operating voltage was 25kV and working distance \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n18 \n \n\n15 mm, carbon coating was applied to the samples to enhance the electron \n\nemission from their surface. \n\n3.2.4. Chemical analysis \n\n3.2.4.1. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy \nChemical analysis for less than 63 \u00b5m fraction was performed using X-ray \n\nfluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). Preparation of sample included the mixture of \n\n10 g of sample with 5 drops of 2% Mowiol\u00ae (commercial product of polyvinyl \n\nalcohol) to improve adhesion and then pressure into platelet applying 15 T of \n\npressure for 40 seconds.  Analysis was performed with XRF AxiosPANalytical \n\nspectrometer equipped with Rh bulb, the gas used - Argon/Methane, data \n\nprocessing program \u2013 IQ+ (major elements) and Pro-Trace (minor elements). For \n\ncomplete chemical analysis loss of ignition (LOI) was also determined by heating \n\n1g of the sample at 1000o C for 1 hour in furnace. \n\n3.2.4.2.  Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy \nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was applied to study elemental \n\nanalysis for minerals observed in SEM. It allowed us to confirm the type of mineral \n\nand to calculate its chemical formula. In case of doubts, it helped to identify the \n\npossible mineral, studying the obtained chemical analysis.  The same Hitachi S-\n\n4100 microscope as for SEM analysis was used for EDS analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n19 \n \n\n4.

Discussion and Conclusion \nThe results obtained from XRD, XRF and SEM-EDS analyses are discussed in two \nparts as following: \n\n1. Lithostratigraphic markers \n2. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction and diagenesis \n\n \n\n5.1. Lithostratigraphic markers \nOne major application of clay minerals in basin analysis consists of the utilization \nof selected minerals as lithostratigraphic markers allowing the definition of guide-\nlayers in field sections or in borehole logs. These guide-layers are established on \nthe basis of clear anisotropies found out in the lateral or vertical evolution of the \nselected mineralogical parameters. The use of clay minerals as lithostratigraphical \nmarkers can be announced like a fossil, a mineral or an association of minerals \ncan characterize a layer and allow regional correlations (Pomerol, 1987). \n\nAccording to Results (I), formation of Esbarrondadoiro can be divided into two \nunits based on bulk sample analysis and clay size fraction analysis. \n\n1.  Formation of Esbarrondadoiro Unit (I). This unit (samples S5, S6, S7, S8) \nconsists of phyllosilicate + quartz + K-feldspar + plagioclase. In the clay size \nfraction, this unit is characterized by the clay mineral assemblage of \nkaolinite + illite with very minor amounts of smectite and mixed layers KS.    \n\n2. Formation of Esbarrondadoiro Unit (II). This unit (sample S9) consists of \nless phyllosilicate + high quartz + high K-feldspar + high plagioclase + small \namount of opal, calcite and dolomite. In clay size fraction, this unit can be \ndistinguished with the more proportional ratio of kaolinite and illite minerals.  \n \n\nTable 9- Mineralogical composition of samples from Formation of \nEsbarrondadoiro. \n\n \n\nS5 67 23 9 2\n\nS6 70 5 4 19 1\n\nS7 78 9 8 4\n\nS8 74 15 5 2 4\n\nS9 16 42 19 15 3 3 2\n\nHematite Pyrite   \n\n \n\nEsbarronda\n\ndoiro\n\nK-Feldspar Plag.

Formation of Ervidel Unit (I). It contains phyllosilicate + quartz + K-feldspar \n+ plagioclase + opal + carbonates (calcite/dolomite) with minor amount of \nhematite/pyrite. The samples (S1, S2, S3, SG1, SG2 and SG3) are \nrelatively poor in phyllosilicate and rich in carbonates >10% (calcite or/and \ndolomite).  \n\n2. Formation of Ervidel Unit (II). This unit consists of samples (S4, SG4, SG5, \nSG6 and SG7) which are relatively richer in phyllosilicate, they are very \npoor in carbonates. \n\n \n\nTable 10- Mineralogical composition of samples from Formation of Ervidel. \n\n \n\nNote: Phy \u2013 phyllosilicates; Plag \u2013 Plagioclase. \n\nIn clay size fraction, this formation contains palygorskite, illite, smectite, chlorite, \nkaolinite and mixed layers KS or/and CS. \n\nThe bulk sample analysis (from Results(I) and (II) ) reveals that Formation of Vale \ndo Guizo consists of phyllosilicate, quartzs, K-feldspar, plagioclase, varying \ncontent of carbonates (calcite, dolomite) with minor amount of opal, anatase, \nhematite, pyrite and magnesite in some samples. Based on mineralogical \nassociations, two units are distinguished here as following: \n\n1. Formation of Vale do Guizo Unit (I). The samples (S10, S11, S12, S13, \nSG11, SG12 and SG14) are relatively rich in phyllosilicate and poor in \nterms of carbonates. \n\n2. Formation Vale do Guizo Unit (II). The samples (SG8, SG9, SG10 and \nSG13) are relatively rich in carbonates (calcite or/and dolomite) and \npoor in phyllosilicate. \n\n \nIn clay size fraction, Formation of Vale do Guizo contains palygorskite, smectite, \nchlorite, illite, kaolinite with small quantity of mixed layer KS. \n \n \n \n\nPhy.

The younger Miocene formation, Formation of \nEsbarrandodairo has the least mean Kubler index value (1.8) whereas the more \nolder formations, Formations of Ervidel and Vale do Guizo have the mean Kubler \nindex values of 3.4 and 3.8 respectively showing that  there are more diagenetic \nimprints on the older formations. \n\n \n\n5.2.  Paleoenvironment \nA schematic sedimentary model for palygorskite formation is given in Figure 17 \nthat shows a cross section where the transition from an alluvial fan environment to \na palustrine\u2013lacustrine one can be observed, taking into account the presence of a \nsource area comprised igneous and metamorphic rocks and the interaction of \nthree water types: groundwater, runoff and lacustrine water. The rocky substrate of \nthe parent area is fundamental in order to justify inputs of Mg or Si. The silica input \ncan come from any magmatic rock, particularly those with a felsic composition, or \nfrom silica-rich metamorphic rocks and siliciclastic or biosiliceous (diatomite) \nsedimentary rocks. The Mg source can be any type of rock containing Mg-rich \nminerals, including magmatic rock (basalt, gabbro and peridotite), metamorphic \nrock (slate, serpentinite) or sedimentary rock (dolomite, magnesite and magnesian \nclays). The Si and Mg released in these zones can travel distances and \naccumulate in flooded lacustrine zones. Given its low solubility except with very \nalkaline pH levels, aluminium will tend to be less mobile and remain in the vicinity \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n34 \n \n\nof its parent rock area, or it may be transported as sediment in aluminous clay \nparticles or colloids. Phenomena occurring in the parent rock area can favour the \nformation of aluminous clay minerals and the release of Mg and Si, which would \nfavour palygorskite formation in lacustrine conditions, mainly by transformation. \nDetrital aluminous clay minerals are abundant in distal alluvial fan facies. \nPalygorskite may be formed there as the result of the transformation of the \ninherited aluminous clays in the vicinity of a lacustrine environment, particularly \nduring periods of exposure. This process favours calcite precipitation. In areas \nnearest to a lake, more specifically in the zone containing intertidal mudflats where \nthe water is more alkaline, the transformation of aluminous smectite into saponite \nwould be favoured instead of forming palygorskite. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 17- Environmental model of the genesis of palygorskite. \n\n \n\n5.3.  Genesis of palygorskite in Formation of Vale do Guizo \nThe mineralogical and chemical data suggest that palygorskite has been formed \nby transformation of smectite into palygorskite as it is evident by the inverse \nrelationship between two minerals (further study of samples through transmission \nelectron microscopy is needed to show the step by step the transformation \nphases). Samples S11, S12, S13, S14, SG11, SG12 and SG14 belong to the \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n35 \n \n\nalluvial fan facies. Samples SG8, SG9, SG10 and SG13 which are rich in \ncarbonates can be attributed to distal facies (SG13, having calcite as major \ncarbonate) and lacustrine-palustrine environment (SG8, SG9, SG10,having \ndolomite as major carbonate ). \n\nIt is interesting to note that an inverse relationship can be established between \nsmectite and palygorskite content (Fig. 18). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 18- Relationship between palygorskite and smectite content in the studied \nsamples from Formation of Vale do Guizo, Sado basin. \n\n \n\n5.4. Genesis of Palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel  \nThe formation of palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel seems to have been evolved \nfrom the transformation of illite into palygorskite as described for palygorskite \ndeposit in Torrejon, Spain (Galan et al., 1975; Galan &amp; Castillo, 1984), by \ndegradation of schist illite and chlorite under acid conditions, and subsequent Mg \nfixing in the basin in an alkaline environment. Samples S4, SG4, SG5, SG6 and \nSG7 belong to the alluvial fan facies. Samples S1, S2, S3, SG1 and SG2 which \nare rich in carbonates can be attributed to distal facies and lacustrine-palustrine \nenvironment (SG3) having dolomite as major carbonate. \n\nIt is interesting to note here that an inverse relationship can be established \nbetween palygorskite and illite amount in this formation instead of palygorskite and \nsmectite content as in Formation of Vale do Guizo (Fig. 19). \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 19- Relationship between palygorskite and illite content in the studied \nsamples from Formation of Ervidel, Sado basin. \n\nThe presence of palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel and Formation of Vale do \nGuizo is evident of arid to semi arid paleoclimate with the installation of small \nmudflats in the middle of basin during the time of deposition of these formations \nduring Eocene. The typical fluvial fan system progrades to western part of the \nbasin into palustrine environment. \n\n\n\nPALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) \n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n6.
