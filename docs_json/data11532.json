However, \nin a more realistic approach, the presence of blood plasma biomolecules must be considered in \nany nanotoxicological evaluation of porous SiO2 nanoparticles when biomedical applications \nthrough intravenous administration are aimed. In this context, it is demonstrated in this work that \nporous silica nanoparticles do not induce any cytotoxic effect on RBCs when hemolysis assay \nis done in the presence of blood plasma, regardless the surface charge (positive or negative) of \nthe nanoparticle. The absence of hemolysis is mainly associated with the adsorption of plasma \nproteins on the nanoparticle surface, which leads to the formation of a stable protein coating (called \nprotein corona or PC) that shields the original microchemical environment of bare nanoparticles.\n\nKeywords: nanoparticles, SiO2, mesopores, hemolytic effect, protein corona\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince porous silica nanoparticles were elected as \npossible protagonists in a future revolution of several \nmedical processes of theranosis, they have been widely \nstudied during the last decade through the host-guest \napproach, thus resulting in promising perspectives mainly \nin the areas of detection1-3 and treatment of tumors.4-7 \nWhile part of the scientific community creatively advances \n\ntowards the engineering of porous silica nanostructures, \nothers are acting in a proactive approach by considering \nenvironmental and toxicological effects of nano-based silica \nmaterials. In the latter context, several in vitro citotoxicity \nassays indicated a very high biocompatibility of porous \nsilica nanoparticles.8-10 However, a desirable in vivo \nbiocompatibility is not straightforward. For instance, it is \nwell known that amorphous silica particles induce toxicity \non human red blood cells (RBCs) and, consequently, \nthis test is being used as a key indicator towards the safe \nproduction of SiO2 platforms for nanomedicine through \nintravenous administration. Although the mechanism of \nthe silica-induced hemolysis phenomenon is not yet totally \n\n\n\nSuppression of the Hemolytic Effect of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles after Protein Corona Interaction J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1808\n\nunderstood, it is known that the hemolytic effect is mainly \nassociated with the surface microchemical environment of \nsilica, which consists primarily of silanol groups (Si\u2013OH) \nthat can ionize and interact with phosphatidylcholine \ngroups of RBC membranes leading to their disruption.11,12 \nConsequently, the density of silanol groups over the surface \nwas proved to be directly related with the hemolysis, \nalthough this relationship is not strictly predictable.\n\nSince the engineering of silica nanostructures advanced \nalong the last decade, parameters other than the concentration \nof silanol groups at the nanoparticle surface were \nrecognized as being responsible for the toxicity on RBCs. \nIn this way, the evaluation of the dependence of the size \nand shape of porous SiO2 nanostructures on the hemolysis \nof RBCs has been systematically done during the last years. \nFirstly, it was observed that silanol groups on mesoporous \nsilica structures induce less hemolytic effect compared to \nrigid spherical nanoparticles possibly due to shape-induced \neffects, which determine the spatial availability of silanols \non the nanoparticle-cell interface.13 Further, it was observed \nthat: (i) smaller St\u00f6ber silica nanoparticles (24 nm) \ninduce a pronounced hemolytic effect when compared \nwith bigger ones (263 nm);14 (ii) nanostructures with high \naspect ratio (nanorods) are more cytotoxic than spherical \nnanoparticles;15 (iii) mesoporous silica nanostructures \n(MSNs) with ordered pores (MCM-41) induce a stronger \nhemolytic effect compared with non-ordered;14 (iv) small \nmesoporous nanoparticles (20 nm) consisted of ethenylene-\nbridged silsesquioxane present very low toxicity16 and (v) \npolymers such as PEG (polyethylene glycol) can be used \nto coat particles in order to greatly reduce the hemolysis.17 \nFurthermore, an extensive assessment of the interaction \nof bare and functionalized porous silica nanomaterials \nwith RBCs concluded that SBA-15-type MSNs cause \nthe deformation of RBCs and consequently lead to their \ndisruption. Amine functionalizations on the surfaces of \nMSNs also reduce the hemolytic effect.18 However, despite \nall improvements achieved so far on the SiO2 surface \nchemistry aiming to overcome the citotoxicity issues, \na key parameter must be now considered when dealing \nwith interactions of nanostructures in biological media. \nDawson\u2019s group at UCD, Dublin, has demonstrated that \nthe adsorption of plasma biomolecules on the nanoparticle \nsurface leads to the formation of a stable biomolecule \ncoating, which has been called protein corona (PC).19,20 \nThe composition of this coating changes over time because \nthe adsorption is a dynamical process in which there is \nexchange between the constituents of the corona and \nbiological medium. PC has been divided into two main \ncomponents named \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d coronas, which \nare characterized by \u201clong\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d exchange times, \n\nrespectively. These coatings greatly influence on the way \nthat the nanometer entity is \u201cseen\u201d by cell and organs.21,22 \nIn this case, the dependence of size, porous structure and \nsurface chemistry of SiO2 nanoparticles on the hemolysis of \nRBCs may manifest differently when such nanostructures \ninteract with proteins of the human blood plasma and, \nconsequently, the final effect on RBCs is a result of the \nPC formation and not only of the bare silica surface itself. \nIn this context, it is important to call the attention for the \nsuppression of the hemolysis when the assay is performed \nin the blood plasma medium. \n\nIn this paper, it is demonstrated that porous SiO2 \nnanoparticles in the sub-hundred nanometer range with \nthree different surface microchemical environments (and \nelectrochemical features) do not induce toxicity on RBCs \nwhen evaluated in the presence of human blood plasma, \nthereby contrasting with the pronounced hemolytic effect \nobserved when the assay is done in phosphate buffer \nsolution (PBS).\n\nExperimental\n\nSynthesis of porous silica nanoparticles\n\nIn order to evaluate these surface effects above \nmentioned, silica nanoparticles with a size distribution from \n40-80 nm and pore size around 2 nm were produced through \na sol-gel method previously reported.23 This methodology \nis basically a modification of the St\u00f6ber method,24 which \nuses TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) as the Si precursor and \nammonia solution (NH3) as the basic catalyst. The synthesis \nof porous silica nanoparticles was carried out under a \nhigh concentration of precursors, which grants highly \nuniform spherical-shaped nanoparticles. For this, 0.75 g of \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved \nin 20.0 mL of a NH3 aqueous solution (0.048 mol L\n\n\u20131) and \nthe final solution was homogenized under magnetic stirring \nin a round-bottomed distillation flask attached to a reflux \ncondenser at 5 \u00b0C (to avoid ethanol evaporation). To this \nsolution, 3.20 mL of absolute ethanol were added as the \ncosolvent and the mixture was homogenized for 15 min at \n60 \u00b0C. Sequentially, 2.50 mL of TEOS (1.20 mmol) were \ninserted and the flask was kept at the same temperature for \n2 h under stirring. By ending the reaction, products were \nisolated by centrifugation at 17,949 rcf (Beckman Coulter, \nBrea, USA) and washed with absolute ethanol before the \nextraction of the soft-template (CTAB). Finally, the sample \nwas washed twice with absolute ethanol and dried at 60 \u00b0C \nfor 24 h. This sample was named Si\u2013OH, according to the \nsurface microchemical environment, which consists of \nsilanol groups. Details regarding the extraction process \n\n\n\nPaula et al. 1809Vol. 23, No. 10, 2012\n\nof CTAB are described in the Supplementary Information \n(SI) section.\n\nSurface functionalization of porous silica nanoparticles\n\nThe influence of the surface microchemical environment \non the hemolysis of RBCs was evaluated through the \nstrict decoration of the nanoparticle surface in order to \ngenerate antagonistic electrochemical environments \n(negatively and positively charged) as a function of the \norganosilanes used for functionalization. These different \nmicrochemical environments would provide useful insights \nregarding possible chemical interactions occurring with \nRBCs. For the first case, the negatively charged surface, \na hierarchical functionalization of the nanoparticle with \npropylmethylphosphonate (an ionizable group) was achieved \nby a sequential addition of the organosilane as a function \nof the reaction time. This co-condensation method was \nintroduced by Bein and co-workers.25 In this way, 127.7 \u00b5L of \n3-(trihydroxysilyl)-propylmethyl-phosphonate (THSPMP) \nwere added after 90 min of synthesis, time in which most of \nsilica monomers are already condensed as nanoparticles. The \nquantity of THSPMP used represents an excess of 2.5% mol \nof silicon based on the quantity used for the production of \nsample Si\u2013OH. In this approach, just an external decoration \nwas promoted during the last 30 min of reaction, while the \ninternal porous structure is preserved as the same as for \nsample Si\u2013OH. All synthetic conditions and experimental \napparatus were the same used for the synthesis of sample \nSi\u2013OH. This sample was named Si\u2013P(CH3)O3H.\n\nIn order to obtain a positively charged surface \non the silica porous nanoparticles, a decoration with \n3-aminopropyl moieties was carried out by a different \nprocess once the co-condensation of its respective \norganosilane (3-aminopropyltrietoxysilane or APTES) \ninduces a variation in the pH that leads to the production \nof elongated nanoparticles (aggregated). In this way, \nthe modification of the silica surface was done by a \npost-grafting process of sample Si\u2013OH. The residual \nCTAB still present in the pores of the SiO2 nanoparticles \nhinders the attachment of APTES on the internal porous \nstructure, thus restricting the decoration on the external \nsurface. For this, 290 mg of sample Si\u2013OH (before \nsubmitting to the extraction process of CTAB) were \nresuspended by sonication in 40 mL of ethanol for 30 min \nand transferred to a round-bottomed distillation flask \nattached to a reflux condenser at 5 \u00b0C. The suspension \nwas homogenized under stirring for 15 min at 60 \u00b0C, and \nthen 730 \u00b5L of APTES were added to the mixture (excess \nof 25% mol of silicon based on sample Si\u2013OH). The \nreaction was kept under stirring at 60 \u00b0C for 60 min and \n\nat room temperature for 24 h. The percentage of silicon \n(% mol of Si) per gram of sample Si\u2013OH was calculated \nthrough a thermogravimetric analysis by considering the \nresidue above 850 \u00b0C as being just silicon dioxide (SiO2). \nAfter the synthesis, products (sample Si?NH2) were \nisolated by centrifugation at 17,949 rcf and washed with \nabsolute ethanol before the extraction of the soft-template \n(CTAB). Finally, the sample was washed twice with \nabsolute ethanol and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. More details \nregarding the experimental procedures as well as the \ncharacterization methods are provided in the SI section.\n\nIncubation of SiO2 nanoparticles with human blood plasma\n\nThe preserved human blood plasma (250 mL) was \nobtained from the Hemocenter of Campinas at the \nUniversity of Campinas (Unicamp , S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil). \nFor the formation of the protein-coated nanoparticles, the \nplasma was firstly centrifuged at 17,949 rcf for 10 min and \nthe supernatant was used in the experiments. Porous SiO2 \nnanoparticles (5.0 mg mL\u20131 in deionized water) were then \nincubated with the centrifuged plasma at 55% for 1 h at \nroom temperature in microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, \nHamburg, Germany). After that, the tubes were centrifuged \nfor 17,949 rcf for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded \nand the obtained pellets (nanoparticles-PC complexes) \nwere washed for 3 times with a phosphate buffer solution \nto remove the excess of unbound plasma proteins. In order \nto demonstrate the protein corona formation, dynamic \nlight scattering (DLS) measurements (Malvern, Malvern, \nUK) were performed by using 50 \u00b5g mL\u20131 of bare and \nPC-nanoparticles in deionized water (DI water).\n\nHemolysis assay\n\nThe impact of the nanoparticle surface chemistry on \nhuman red blood cells (RBCs) and the influence of the \nprotein corona interaction on this process were evaluated \nby the standard hemolysis assays.26 It was used RBCs from \npreserved human blood, obtained from the Hemocenter \nof Campinas at the University of Campinas (Unicamp). A \nvolume of 8 mL of blood was added to 0.8 mL of a 3.8% \nsodium citrate solution in a 15 mL Falcon tube to prevent \ncoagulation. The blood was mixed gently and centrifuged \nat 10,000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded \nand RBCs were washed 5 times by suspending them in \na phosphate buffer saline solution (pH 7.4). The final \nsuspension used for the hemolysis assay consisted of 5% \n(v/v) of RCBs in a phosphate buffer solution. To evaluate the \nhemolytic effect, different concentrations of nanoparticles \nwere incubated with RBCs (200 \u00b5L of a 5% suspension) \n\n\n\nSuppression of the Hemolytic Effect of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles after Protein Corona Interaction J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1810\n\nin the presence and absence of blood plasma at 2% (20 \n\u00b5L of centrifuged plasma) in a phosphate buffer solution \nin sterile microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were incubated \nfor 2 h at room temperature through a static method after \ngently homogenization. The final volume of the hemolysis \nassay in all experiments was 1.0 mL. After the incubation, \ntubes were centrifuged for 5 min and 100 \u00b5L were carefully \nremoved from each tube and transferred to a clean 96-well \nplate. The quantification of hemoglobin in the supernatant \nof a nanoparticle-RBC mixture and nanoparticle-protein \ncorona-RBC mixture was done by recording the absorbance \nof hemoglobin at 540 nm (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The \npositive control consisted of 0.8 mL of deionized water and \n0.2 mL of a RBCs suspension at 5%. The negative control \nconsisted of 0.8 mL of a phosphate buffer solution and \n0.2 mL of the RBCs suspension (5%). The percentage of \nhemolysis was calculated by using the linear equation y = mx \n+ c, where the percentage of hemolysis (x) = [optical density \n(y) \u2013 negative control optical density (c)] / [(positive control \noptical density \u2013 negative control optical density)/100]. \nTo demonstrate the influence of the specific surface area \nof porous SiO2 nanoparticles on the hemolytic effect, the \namount of nanoparticles used in the hemolysis assay was \nnormalized according to the specific surface area estimated \nthrough the BET method.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe spherical morphology of the synthesized silica \nnanoparticles is highly uniform for the three samples produced, \npresenting diameters which vary from approximately 40 \n-80 nm, as observed through bright-field transmission \nelectron microscopy (BF-TEM, see Figure 1) and through \nthe nanoparticle size distribution (insets, Figure 1) resulted \nfrom the measurement of the Feret diameter of at least \n100 particles observed in the images. An examination \nof the porosity by nitrogen adsorption-desorption \nexperiments shows the presence of a complex porous \nstructure, manifested in a type II isotherm with a H3-like \nhysteresis for all samples (IUPAC classification). However, \na subtle stepwise behavior is observed around P/P0 = 0.4  \n(see Figure S1a in the SI section), which is related to a \ncapillarity phenomenon, typical of ordered mesopore \nstructures. The specific surface area of the samples varied \nfrom 855 m2 g\u20131 for the bare silica (sample Si\u2013OH) to the \nminimum value of 624 m2 g\u20131 for sample Si\u2013NH2, thus \nindicating that the degree of surface functionalization \nwith aminopropyl and propylmethylphosphonate radicals \ncauses just a minor obstruction of the porous cavities. As \nfurther shown, this decrease in the specific surface area \nis proportional to the amount of condensed groups on \n\nthe particle surface. Parallely, pore volumes presented a \nsubtle increase with the surface functionalization of the \nnanoparticles, varying from 0.8 to 1.1 cm3 g\u20131 (see Table 1). \nThe size distribution of the non-ordered pores calculated \nthrough the BJH method from the N2 adsorption branch \nspans from less than 2 to 5 nm (see Figure S1b in the SI \nsection), thus comprising pores that cover the micro- and \nmesopore size classification. With the use of the high \nangle annular dark-field transmission electron microscopy \n(HAADF-TEM), the greater contrast differences based \non the electron scattering phenomenon from sample \nthickness allowed an accurate pore size distribution \nmeasurement, indicating an average diameter of 1.8 nm \n(standard deviation = 0.5).23 Due to the low amount of \nsurface functionalizing organic groups used as well as due \nto the overlapping of bands in Fourier transform infrared \n(FTIR) spectra, vibrational fingerprints are not suitable for \neither identification or quantification of the functionalizing \nradicals on the nanoparticles. In this way, the confirmation of \nthe external functionalization on the SiO2 nanoparticles was \ndone through 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with \nthe method of cross polarization and magic angle spinning \nof neighboring 1H nuclei (CPMAS). As observed in the \nchemical structure diagram and NMR spectra (see Figures \nS2 and S3a in the SI section), the presence of carbon atoms \nrelative to propylamine and propylmethylphosphonate \ngroups is evidenced in the range from 0 to 80 ppm of \n13C NMR spectra. As expected, ethoxy (Si?O\u2013CH2CH3) \ngroups originated from the extraction process of CTAB \nwith the ethanolic solution of hydrochloric acid are \nevidenced, as well as carbon atoms related to residues of \nCTAB inside the pores. The degree of condensation of the \norganosilanes was obtained through 29Si NMR with the \nmethod of high-power decoupling (HPDEC, 29Si ? 1H), \nwhich provides a quantitative relation between the different \nsilicon sites present in the samples. After deconvolution of \npeaks with Gaussian functions (see Figures S3b, S3c and \nS3d in the SI section), the calculus indicated that there \nare approximately 7.1 and 2.0%-mol of silicon bonded \nto propylamine and propylmethylphosphonate groups, \nrespectively. Surface electrochemical features achieved \nwith the functionalization on each nanoparticle are observed \nthrough zeta potential measurements (see Table 1). The \nresults indicated the presence of a more positively-charged \nsurface for sample Si\u2013NH2 and a more negative surface \nfor sample Si\u2013P(CH3)O3H. By considering the deviation \nof about 200 m2 g\u20131 in the specific surface area value, this \nparameter was normalized for the hemolysis experiments. \nIn this way, differences in the RBC citotoxicity could be \nassociated to the peculiar surface characteristics of the \nnanoparticles.\n\n\n\nPaula et al. 1811Vol. 23, No. 10, 2012\n\nThe surface electrochemical characteristics between \nsamples Si?OH, Si?NH2 and Si?P(CH3)O3H reflected \nin a very little differentiation on the adsorption features \nof proteins when the nanoparticles were dispersed in \nhuman blood plasma (55% of blood plasma). After \nseveral washing and centrifugation runs to ensure the \nelimination of weakly adsorbed biomolecules (i.e., \u201csoft\u201d \ncorona), the presence of strongly adsorbed proteins (i.e., \n\u201chard\u201d corona)21 on the porous silica nanoparticle surface \nis directly evidenced through dynamic light scattering \nanalyses (DLS), which indicated larger particle diameters \nfor the protein-coated nanoparticles (see Figure 2). The \nincrease in the diameter after the interaction with the blood \nplasma varied from about 15 to 30 nm. The greater degree \nof functionalization in sample Si\u2013NH2 (ca. 7% mol of Si, as \nseen through 29Si HPDEC NMR) compared to Si?P(CH3)\nO3H (ca. 2% mol of Si) did not induce a variation in the \nhydrodynamic radius. The monodispersity of the three \nsamples is confirmed through the polydispersity index \n(PdI) obtained for the suspensions in deionized water \n(DI), whose values were observed to be below 0.13 for \nall samples. After the dispersion in the biological medium \n(55% of blood plasma), although the presence of the \n\u201chard\u201d corona led to an increase of the nanoparticles \nsizes, the polydispersity index did not change (below \n0.13). Zeta potential values for protein-coated silica \nnanoparticles at a pH of 7.4 (PBS) were all negative and no \n\nsignificant variations were observed for the three samples \n(average = \u201314.3 \u00b1 9.2 mV).\n\nThe schematic diagram presented in Figure 3 summarizes \nthe surface groups sitting on the nanoparticles which \nwere used to probe the different interaction possibilities \nwith the constituents from the human blood plasma. \nThis might result in different toxicological effects of the \nporous silica nanoparticle on RBCs. Initially, by neglecting \nparticular interactions with RBCs that might emerge from \nstereochemical considerations as well as from hydrogen \nbonds and van der Waals forces (peculiar for each chemical \nmoiety use), it would be considered here just the interactions \narisen from an electrostatic point of view (Coulomb forces), \nthrough ionization and protonation events that lead to \nantagonistically charged chemical radicals. Furthermore, \nthe key event being considered responsible for the hemolysis \nis the interaction with RBC membranes, while secondary \nmetabolic effects induced by the presence of porous silica \nnanoparticles are being neglected by the approaches reported \nso far in the literature.14-16,18\n\nAs it has been recently reported,21,22,27 the dynamic \ninteraction phenomenon occurring in biological media in \nwhich biomolecules may adsorb on a nanoparticle surface \n(and also desorb from it) results in a corona coating \n(illustrated in Figure 3b) that will play a key role in all \nfurther biological effects manifested in a living organism. \nIn a more specific case, the influence of these coatings on \n\nTable 1.

Chem. Soc.1812\n\nthe hemolysis of RBCs was analyzed here for positively \nand negatively charged porous silica nanoparticles. \nThe hemolysis was evaluated for five concentration of \neach functionalized nanoparticle (Si\u2013OH, Si\u2013NH2 and \nSi\u2013P(CH3)O3H): 32.2, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 \u00b5g mL\n\n\u20131. \nPositive and negative controls were taken with DI \nwater and PBS. In the first case, when the assays were \nperformed with porous silica nanoparticles dispersions \nin PBS, up to the maximum concentration used in this \nstudy (500 \u00b5g mL\u20131), the toxicity was dose-dependent for \nall samples (see top panel in Figure 4a). Silanol groups \non the surface (sample Si\u2013OH) induced the highest \ntoxicity among samples, thus leading to the breaking of \nmore than 50% of RBCs present in the solution. Sample \nSi?NH2 presented the lowest cytotoxic response (10% of \nhemolysis). When the hemolytic assay was carried out in a \nphosphate buffer solution containing human blood plasma, \neven in low concentrations of plasma such as 2%, it was \nobserved the absence of hemolysis for all samples and all \nconcentrations tested (see bottom panel in Figure 4a). The \nabsence of hemolysis was also observed for hard corona \nsilica nanoparticles obtained after their incubation with \n55% of plasma (data not shown). \n\nBy assuming the occurrence of a surface-induced \n\nbiological effect that leads to the breaking of RBCs, the \nhemolysis is primarily related to the amount of atoms \nexposed to cells at the solid-liquid interface, which are \nresponsible for the chemical interactions. Thus, as there \nis a difference in the specific surface area among samples \nSi\u2013OH, Si\u2013NH2 and Si\u2013P(CH3)O3H, another hemolysis \nassay in a phosphate buffer solution (without blood \nplasma) was carried out by normalizing the quantity \nof nanoparticles used in the experiments by the highest \nspecific surface area (855 m2 g\u20131 for sample Si\u2013OH). \nThrough this experiment, it was observed that the specific \nsurface area-normalized nanoparticles with negatively \ncharged surface (samples Si\u2013OH and Si\u2013P(CH3)O3H) \npresent practically the same citotoxicity.

In this way, other \nmechanisms and interactions such as ROS, hydrogen \nbonds and van der Waals forces must be considered \nas responsible for the citotoxicity observed here. On \nthe other hand, the low hemolytic effect induced by \nsample Si\u2013NH2 may be mainly associated to the positive \nvalue of zeta potential, which cancels the electrostatic \ninteractions with the positively charged tetra-alkyl \nammonium groups present in the membranes. However, \nregardless positive or negative surface charges, the \nadsorption of plasma biomolecules (mainly proteins) \non the nanoparticle surfaces occurred for all samples \nanalyzed. Thus, the suppression of the hemolysis after \nthe protein corona interaction on all samples demonstrates \nthat the biomolecule coating acts as a very efficient \nsurface shielding, thus isolating the surface microchemical \nenvironment of the nanoparticle regardless the surface \ncharge (positive or negative), as well as other peculiar \nchemical characteristics of the surface moieties used \n(silanol, amine and methylphosphonate).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis work contributes to add information to the \ndatabase of physical chemical and toxicological properties \nof porous silica nanoparticles reported in the literature by \nusing the hemolysis of human red blood cells as a simple \nshort-term in vitro assay towards a safe nanotechnology. It \nwas shown here that human blood plasma suppresses the \nhemolytic effect of porous silica nanoparticles regardless \ntheir surface microchemical environment. Although the \nphenomenon is clearly observed, there is not yet enough \nknowledge about the mechanisms that dictates the \ninteractions at the nanoparticle/protein corona/red blood \ncell interfaces present in the biological milieu. Therefore, \nunderstanding the mechanisms of the protein corona \ninteraction and their impact on the cell surface has become \nan important aspect along with the design of silica-based \nnanostructures for nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine, \nand this paper addresses some issues on this direction. \nFurthermore, the protein corona may be considered not \nonly as an important biological phenomenon that must be \nrecognized hereafter on nanotoxicology, but also a useful \ncoating process that may be used as a tool to minimize \nnanoparticles toxicity of several materials making them \nbiocompatible for uncountable envisaged applications in \nnanomedicine.\n\nFigure 4.
