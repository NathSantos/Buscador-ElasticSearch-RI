The physical problem is modeled as a macroporous \n\nmedia composed by the product itself and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow is \n\nassumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. As a first validation, the \n\nmodel is simulated for several exterior air temperatures, under environmental fluctuations \n\n(boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were compared, varying average air \n\ntemperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation, one by one. As a general result, it is \n\nobserved that the product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is directly associated \n\nwith frost formation into the container. Frost formation increases with large amplitude of \n\noscillation, but decreases with higher frequencies and higher mean temperatures. Model \n\nparameters were obtained for two assembling: frozen slices of carrots and air, and frozen extra \n\nthin green beans and air. Parameter definition and evaluation combines literature review, \n\nmeasurements and numerical simulation. In general, parameters which characterize these \n\nporous media were similar for both products, even though they display different geometries. \n\nThe experimental validation is performed for carrot slices with two temperature cycles. The \n\nnumerical model is able to predict air velocity field, air and product temperatures, and local \n\nfrost formation. Results are validated in respect to a set of independent experimental results \n\nthat shown a good agreement. Air flow circulation is as expected due to natural convection. \n\nProduct temperature simulated behavior agrees with measurements, and temperature values \n\ndiffer by less than 12%. Respect to frost formation predictions, the model predicts correctly \n\nthe most susceptible regions to frost formation. However, the quantity of frost formed \n\npredicted by the model (           ) is lower than the experimental one (          ), \n\ndespite being of the same order of magnitude. The effect of each parameter in the model is \n\nstudy in order to detect how to improve the model. The most important parameters affecting \n\ntotal frost formation are effective mass diffusivity and convective heat coefficient into the \n\nstorage container. Adjusting these parameters to twice, better results in terms of frost \n\nformation could be obtained (           ). \n\n \n\nKeywords: Frozen food; Porous media; Heat and mass transfer; Temperature fluctuation; \n\nNatural convection; Frost formation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nvi \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nEste trabalho prop\u00f5e um modelo de transfer\u00eancia de calor e massa para prever a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngelo em um container preenchido com legumes congelados. O problema f\u00edsico \u00e9 modelado \n\ncomo um meio poroso composto pelo pr\u00f3prio produto e o ar em seu entorno. O regime de \n\nconvec\u00e7\u00e3o natural \u00e9 assumido dentro do container, o qual promove o transporte de massa. \n\nComo uma primeira valida\u00e7\u00e3o, o modelo \u00e9 simulado considerando diferentes temperaturas de \n\nar externo, causadas por flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da vizinhan\u00e7a. Resultados para quatro ciclos de \n\ntemperaturas foram comparados, variando separadamente a temperatura m\u00e9dia do ar, \n\namplitude e frequ\u00eancia de oscila\u00e7\u00e3o. De modo geral, \u00e9 observado que a temperatura do \n\nproduto se comporta assim como era esperado e este resultado \u00e9 diretamente associado \u00e0 \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo dentro do container. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo cresce com uma maior amplitude \n\nde oscila\u00e7\u00e3o, por\u00e9m decresce com um aumento na frequ\u00eancia e na temperatura m\u00e9dia. Os \n\npar\u00e2metros do modelo foram obtidos para dois diferentes produtos: fatias de cenouras \n\ncongeladas e vagens congeladas, ambos em meio ao ar. As defini\u00e7\u00f5es de par\u00e2metros s\u00e3o \n\noriundas de revis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica, medi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais e simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas. Os \n\npar\u00e2metros encontrados para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o desses meios porosos foram similares para \n\nambos os produtos, mesmo eles possuindo diferentes geometrias. A valida\u00e7\u00e3o experimental \n\nfoi feita para as fatias de cenoura considerando dois ciclos de temperatura. O modelo \n\nnum\u00e9rico \u00e9 capaz de prever o campo de velocidades do ar, as temperaturas do produto e a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo local. Os resultados foram validados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a um grupo independente \n\nde resultados num\u00e9ricos, tal compara\u00e7\u00e3o apresentou uma boa concord\u00e2ncia. A circula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nar encontrada \u00e9, de fato, devido \u00e0 convec\u00e7\u00e3o natural. O comportamento da temperatura dos \n\nprodutos simulados concorda com os valores medidos e os valores de temperaturas diferem \n\npor menos de 12%. Com respeito \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo, o modelo \u00e9 capaz de prev\u00ea-la \n\ncorretamente nas regi\u00f5es mais suscet\u00edveis a este fen\u00f4meno. Por\u00e9m, a quantidade de gelo \n\nformado prevista pelo modelo (1,56 g/semana) \u00e9 menor do que a experimental (4,67 \n\ng/semana), apesar de serem de mesma ordem de magnitude. O efeito de cada par\u00e2metro no \n\nmodelo \u00e9 estudado visando detectar maneiras de aprimorar o modelo. Foi encontrado que os \n\npar\u00e2metros mais importantes para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo total s\u00e3o a difusividade de massa efetiva \n\ne o coeficiente de transfer\u00eancia de calor convectivo dentro do container. Ajustando estes \n\npar\u00e2metros duas vezes foi poss\u00edvel encontrar resultados melhores com respeito \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngelo (3,09 g/semana).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nvii \n \n\nPalavras-chave: Comida congelada; Meio poroso; Transfer\u00eancia de calor e massa; Flutua\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde temperatura; Convec\u00e7\u00e3o natural; Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de gelo. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nviii \n \n\n\u00cdNDICE \n\n \n\n1.

In this context, the French Agence \n\nde l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME) offers financial benefits for \n\nindustrial consumers that are capable of disconnecting from the energy network. In the other \n\nhand, consumers must be able to adapt then to a more flexible energy matrix, based on \n\ndifferent sources, like solar or wind. When it concerns the food industry, that procedure may \n\nrespect a compromise, since energy disconnection leads to temperature fluctuation into the \n\nstorage environment, affecting directly product quality, which is an important restriction. \n\nIn frozen food industry, products, and in the particular case of vegetables, are stored at \n\nlow temperature in cold rooms, packed in box pallets covered with a plastic bag. Storage \n\nduration can range from few months up to one year, before being transfer to small packages, \n\nin order to be commercialized. During long term storage into cold rooms, frozen products are \n\nexposed to air temperature fluctuations that impact product quality, like ice recrystallization, \n\ndehydration, frost formation, etc. Therefore, losses can be expected due to the quality of \n\ntemperature management. \n\nFlexifroid\n2\n project, financed by ADEME and carried out by the Institut National de \n\nRecherch\u00e9 en Sciences et Technologies pour l'Environnement et l'Agriculture (IRSTEA) of \n\nFrance and by the frozen food company Bonduelle S.A., wants to answer two questions:  \n\n- Which is the impact of longer or shorter-term periods of energy \n\ndisconnection on product quality?  \n\n- Does energy disconnection cause a final overconsumption? In which \n\ncircumstances? \n\n                                                           \n1\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/ \n\n2\nwww.projetflexifroid.fr \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\n\n\n2 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn this way, the aim of the project is to develop a model to optimize the refrigeration \n\nsystem operation and to predict product quality in different conditions. Results are seen as a \n\ntool for industry and they can, eventually, help to decide on the disconnection of the power \n\nsupply network. \n\nIn order to understand the behavior of bulk storage of frozen vegetables, and to avoid \n\nquality losses, it is necessary to analyze multiphysical phenomena involved inside a pallet \n\nbox, such as heat transfer, airflow, and frost formation.  \n\nSlices of frozen vegetables and the air trapped inside can be modeled as a porous \n\nmedia. That macroporous domain is submitted to temperature fluctuations of the external air, \n\ncaused by the operation of the storage facility refrigerating system. Heat transfer, airflow by \n\nnatural convection, and mass transport lead to product dehydration and frost formation inside \n\nthe pallet. \n\nUnsteady heating and cooling induced by exterior air fluctuations may produce a non-\n\nuniform field of proprieties on the pallet box. Close to external walls, products and air \n\ntemperature would react or respond more rapidly than in the middle of the pallet, due to \n\nthermal inertia. Water from the warmer product is sublimated from hotter regions and then is \n\ndeposited and frozen at the surface of cooler product regions, where temperature is lower than \n\nthe air dew temperature, and frost formation takes place. As a result, product dehydration and \n\nfrost formation are the major quality losses to be avoided, generating changes in product \n\nappearance, color, texture and taste. Moreover, frost deposition generates \u201cblocks\u201d of product-\n\nfrost. \n\nA literature review on airflow, heat transfer and frost formation in frozen porous \n\nmedia is presented. \n\n1.2  Literature review \n\n1.2.1 Transport phenomena in macroporous media \n\nMacroporous media are defined as the porous media in which the ratio of container \n\ndiameter to particle diameter is smaller than 10. Under these conditions, the effect of the \n\ncontainer walls and airflow entrance region cannot be neglected [Alvarez et al., 2003, Amara \n\net al., 2004 and Verboven et al., 2006]. There are several studies supporting the use of heat \n\nand mass transfer models for a porous media, applied to a bulk of food products (macroporous \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \n \n\nmedia). A possible approach is direct CFD simulation, which consist on numerically solving \n\nthe Navier-Stokes and local energy and mass transfer equations [Verboven et al., 2006 and \n\nLaguerre et al., 2008]. This method is limited as it requires large computational hardware \n\n[Laguerre et al., 2008]. Alternatively, good results are obtained by the porous media \n\napproach, based on space average velocity (Darcy velocity) and different methods developed \n\nfor the energy equation, with one and two temperatures models [Rohsenow, 1998]. \n\n1.2.1.1  Natural convection in macroporous media \n\nSome of these works were focused on transport phenomena in porous media under \n\nnatural convection conditions. In this case, a buoyancy term is add to Darcy equation \n\n(momentum equation), coupled to the energy equation. Laguerre et al., 2008, studied transient \n\nheat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres. They developed a packed bed \n\napproach and compared it to direct CFD simulation. They concluded that both approaches \n\nwere in good agreement with experimental values of product and air temperatures. However, \n\nthe CFD approach was harder to mesh and required more computational time, but it was able \n\nto predict fluid flow and temperature in details. Beukema et al., 1982, developed a two \n\ndimensional two phase model of temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and \n\nstorage of fresh agricultural products in cylindrical containers, under natural convection. \n\nModel results showed good agreement with experimental measures for potatoes. Dona and \n\nSewart Jr, 1988, applied the porous media approach to solved numerically natural convection \n\nheat transfer inside a cylindrical grain bin filled with stored corn. The effect of container \n\naspect ratios was also analyzed.  \n\n1.2.1.2  Temperature fluctuation effects in frozen products \n\nConstant temperature storage conditions in frozen food cold stores are very difficult to \n\nattain in practice. It is well known that product can display weight losses due to temperature \n\nfluctuation. As a consequence, sublimated water induces changes in food appearance, color, \n\ntexture and taste [Poovarodom, Tocci and Mascheroni, 1995, and Campa\u00f1one et al., 2001]. \n\nStudies have shown the effect of temperature fluctuations and temperature heterogeneity on \n\nthe quality of the product. For example, Martins et al., 2004, studied the behavior of ascorbic \n\nacid, vitamin C, color and flavor on frozen green beans, and found that thermal fluctuations \n\nare detrimental at higher storage temperatures. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n \n\nNumerous studies show that frozen food weight loss depend on several factors like \n\nfreezing method, storage average temperature and amplitude of temperature fluctuation, \n\nrelative humidity, packaging, etc. Pham et al., 1982, Pham and Willix, 1985, and M\u00e9ndez \n\nBustabad, 1999, studied experimentally the weight loss of lamb, beef and pork frozen \n\ncarcasses. Phimolsiripol et al., 2011, worked with frozen bread dough into a polyethylene bag; \n\nthey proposed a kinetic, physical and artificial neural network model and compared their \n\nresults to experimental measures. Pham and Willix, 1984, developed simple equations to \n\ndescribe the ratio of desiccation of frozen food, taking into account the dehydrate layer. Pham, \n\n1987, presented equations and graphical methods to predict the maximum possible moisture \n\nchange between product and air. Tocci and Mascheroni, 1995, proposed a heat and mass \n\ntransfer model for frozen food storage, capable to predict product (spheres) weight loss, based \n\non an explicit finite difference method. Campa\u00f1o et al, 2005, proposed a numerical model \n\nsolved with implicit finite difference method Campa\u00f1o et al, 2001, and a simplified analytical \n\nmodel Campa\u00f1o et al, 2005, for prediction of weight loss during freezing and storage of \n\nunpacked frozen food, taking into account the changes on the dehydrated layer in the product \n\nsurface. All authors agreed in the fact that product weight loss increases at high temperatures, \n\nlarge amplitudes of fluctuations and low frequencies. They also stated that packaging may \n\nreduce product weight loss. However, none of them studied the posterior frost formation.  \n\n1.2.1.3  Frost formation phenomena \n\nMost studies in this area are focused on frost formation in air coolers. In these \n\nconditions, frost layer thickness and density are key parameters, since they affect significantly \n\nthe heat transfer rate and airflow through the fins. Some of these studies analyzed the effect of \n\nair relative humidity, air temperature and surface temperature [Cheng et al., 2001, Amini et \n\nal., 2014, Haijie et al., 2014, and Wu et al., 2016].  \n\nAs a result of this literature review, it was seen that there are few studies in frost \n\nformation in frozen food. Poovarodom studied experimentally the influence of temperature \n\n(averaged, amplitude and frequency of fluctuations) and the role of packing in the storage of \n\nfrozen meat. She analyzes the product quality and frost formation into the package for \n\ndifferent storage temperature, amplitudes and frequency of fluctuations. Laguerre and Flick, \n\n2007, studied frost formation on frozen products (packed bed of potato and melon balls) \n\ninside hermetic packages in domestic freezers.  They compared the results for four different \n\ninsulation packages and two types of refrigerator (different frequency and amplitude of \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n \n\ntemperature oscillations). They proposed a qualitative model to explain the phenomenon \n\nobserved experimentally. Both studies [Poovarodom, Laguerre and Flick, 2007] concluded \n\nthat frost formation is higher at high storage temperatures, large amplitudes of fluctuations \n\nand low frequencies.  Studies on the modeling of frost formation into a container with frozen \n\nproduct in conditions of natural convection were not found on the open literature.  \n\n1.3  Objectives \n\nThe main goal of this work consists on the prediction of frost formation of frozen \n\nproduct packed on a container submitted to temperature fluctuations under natural convection. \n\nComplementary objectives are: \n\n- Perform an experimental characterization of frost formation. \n\n- Modeling and simulation of heat and mass transfer of the packed frozen \n\nproducts. \n\n- Experimental validation of the model against measured data from \n\ntemperature and frost in different regions of the product container, in two different \n\ntemperature cycles. \n\n1.4  Structure \n\nThe work is organized in five chapters. The first chapter, Introduction, presents a \n\ngeneral review about frost formation in porous media. Modeling airflow, heat and mass \n\ntransfer, and frost formation presents a review of theoretical foundations and literature \n\nreview, about modeling airflow in porous media, heat and mass transfer in porous media and \n\nfrozen food storage (dehydration and frost formation). A numerical model for a cylindrical \n\ncontainer was proposed, implemented in the software CFD COMSOL and test for simple \n\ncases. Parameters identification presents materials and methods used to measure, calculate \n\nand identified parameters that characterized two porous media: slices of frozen carrots and \n\nfrozen green beans. Experimental values were compared between them. Experimental \n\nvalidation presents materials and methods for the experimental validation and compares \n\nexperimental measures and simulation results, for two temperature cycles, with slices of \n\ncarrots. Temperature and frost formation were tested and a study of the influence of different \n\nparameters was done.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nBULK STORAGE OF FROZEN VEGETABLES AS A MACROPOROUS \n\nMEDIA: AIRFLOW, HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER AND FROST \n\nFORMATION MODELING \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nA model of heat and mass transfer is proposed in order to predict frost formation into a closed \n\ncontainer filled with frozen vegetables. The physical problem is modeled as a macroporous \n\nmedia composed by the product itself and the surrounding air. Natural convection airflow is \n\nassumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model is simulated for \n\nseveral exterior air temperatures, under environmental fluctuations (boundary conditions). \n\nResults of four temperature cycles were compared, varying average air temperature, \n\namplitude and frequency of oscillation, one by one. As a general result, it is observed that the \n\nproduct temperature behavior is as expected, and it is directly associated with frost formation \n\ninto the container. The bigger is the change on the product temperature, the bigger is the \n\namount of frost formation. Frost formation increases with large amplitude of oscillation, but \n\ndecreases with higher frequencies and higher mean temperatures. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: modeling heat and mass transfer; temperature fluctuation; natural convection; \n\nCFD simulation; frost formation.  \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n \n\nIndex \n\n1.

Transport phenomena in porous media \n\nA porous medium is a material consisting on a fixed solid matrix with interconnected void \n\nspaces, called pores. The interconnection of pores allows fluid to flow through the material.  \n\nNatural porous media is composed by particles of irregular sizes and shapes, so on pore scale \n\n(microscopic) flow quantities, like velocity and pressure, are irregular. A modeling approach \n\nis based on space averaged quantities (macroscopic), like permeability and equivalent \n\nconductivity, which simplify the description of the flow through the porous medium. \n\nThe spatial average consists on assigning the average quantity value over a representative \n\nelementary volume, to the centroid of it, and the average fluid velocity over a volume element \n\nof the medium is defined as a superficial velocity or the Darcy velocity. \n\nThe porosity   of a porous medium is defined as the fraction of the total volume       \n\n     +       that is occupied by the fluid      , as follows: \n\n  \n     \n\n            \n          (2.1) \n\nIn an isotropic porous media, surface porosity is equal to volumetric porosity. In natural \n\nporous media, the porosity is in general smaller than 0.6. In the case of a bed of uniform \n\nspheres, porosity varies between 0.2595 and 0.4764 [1]. \n\nA porous media placed into a container with rigid and impermeable walls increases its \n\nporosity near the walls, because solid particles are unable to pack together as efficiently as \n\nelsewhere. Experiments have shown that the porosity is a damped oscillatory function of the \n\ndistance from the wall, varying from a value near unity at the wall to nearly core value at \n\nabout five particle diameters away from it [1]. \n\nMacroporous media is defined as the porous media in which the ratio of container diameter to \n\nparticle diameter is smaller than 10.  \n\n1.1. Airflow in a porous media \n\nThe fluid flow through a porous media was at firstly studied experimentally by Darcy. His \n\nexperiments consisted on a column filled with solid particles (sand) and an impose water flow \n\nalong; pressure drop was measured with mercury manometers. Darcy proposed an equation \n\nthat established the proportionality between flow rate and pressure drop for a steady state \n\nunidirectional flow. For an isotropic porous media, the Darcy\u2019s equation can be written as: \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n                (2.2) \n\nWhere    is the pressure gradient through the porous bed,    is the Darcy velocity, defined as \n\nthe average  of the fluid velocity over the total volume of the porous media,   is the dynamic \n\nviscosity of the fluid and    is the permeability of the porous media. This last parameter \n\ndepends only on the porous media geometry, but not on fluid nature. There are different \n\nequations to determine the permeability of a porous media, according to its geometry. For \n\nexample, for a packed bed of spheres, the permeability was related to the porosity and to the \n\nparticle diameter ( ) by the following equation. \n\n  \n    \n\n      \n           (2.3) \n\nWhere   is the particle diameter and    is an experimental factor related to particle shape. \n\nSeveral values between 150 and 199 can be found in literature [1, 2]. \n\nThe increase in fluid velocities isn\u2019t followed by a linear increase in the flow pressure drop. \n\nDupuit and Forchheimer proposed to add a quadratic velocity term to Darcy\u2019s equation, to \n\ntake into account the drag due to the solids obstacles, which is of the same order than the \n\nlinear term. This term can be neglected for small velocities, with Reynolds number of the \n\norder of one or smaller [1]. An extension of the Darcy\u2019s law can be used to consider the \n\neffects of boundary friction, inertia and acceleration. This equation was obtained by analogy \n\nwith the Navier-Stokes equation. In [2], a macroscopic momentum equation is proposed for \n\nnatural convection in enclosed porous cavities, with Boussinesq approximation, as follows: \n\n      \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n      \n\n  \n             \n\n  \n\n \n     \n\n \n\n \n                           \n\n         \n\n  \n   (2.4) \n\n   (I)            (II)                   (III)      (IV)      (V)               (VI)                          (VII) \n\nTerms in that last equation stand for: (I) Acceleration term, (II) Inertia term, (III) Pressure \n\ngradient, (VI) Brinkman term, (V) Darcy term, (VI) Gravitational force, (VII) Forchheimer \n\nterm. \n\nThe Brinkman term (IV) is similar to the Laplacian one in Navier-Stokes, but    is the \n\neffective viscosity, which depends on the fluid viscosity   and the geometry of the porous \n\nmedia. In cases of high porosity, it can be assumed that     . The empirical  coefficient in \n\nForchheimer term (VII) varies with the porous media nature.  \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n \n\n1.2. Heat transfer in a porous media \n\nHeat transfer in a porous media depends on the thermal and physical properties of both the \n\nsolid and the fluid phase. There are two types of approaches for this phenomenon: the one \n\ntemperature model and the two temperature model.  \n\n1.2.1. One temperature model \n\nThis model is based on the hypothesis that the medium is isotropic, and radiant effects, \n\nviscous dissipation and work done by pressure changes, are negligible. One temperature \n\nmodel assumes local thermal equilibrium between solid and fluid phases, and it displays good \n\naccuracy whenever temperature differences between solid and fluid phases at pore scale are \n\nmuch lower than at global scale. When it is subjected to an airflow, heat transfer occurs due to \n\nconduction and convection, and it is characterized by the effective or equivalent thermal \n\nconductivity tensor (   ) and the dispersion tensor ( \n ). In case of isotropic materials, the \n\nequivalent thermal conductivity tensor is a scalar, placed in the energy equation as follows: \n\n       \n  \n\n  \n           \n\n                                 \n                  (2.5) \n\nwhere \n\n       \n                \n\n            \n       (2.6) \n\nThe equivalent thermal conductivity     is obtained by considering the porous medium as \n\nhomogeneous. In case of solid and fluid phases arranged in parallel, it can be defined in a \n\nsimilar way that the equivalent heat capacity per unit volume of the medium,        \n   Other \n\ncorrelations for the equivalent conductivity are presented in Chapter III. Parameters \n\nidentification, depending on fluid and solid thermal conductivities and porosity. \n\nThe thermal dispersion tensor    appears in cases of force convection or vigorous natural \n\nconvection, to take into account convective heat transfer due to mixing of interstitial fluid at \n\npore scale. This mixing phenomenon can occur due to the nature of the porous media: \n\nobstructions, recirculation, wall effect and eddies, etc [1]. The dispersion tensor is a complex \n\nfunction of matrix structure, porosity, and thermal properties of both phases and its \n\nhydrodynamic characteristics [4].  \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n\n1.2.2. Two temperatures model \n\nIn cases of transient heat transfer, significant heat generation or large differences in thermal \n\nproperties between phases, the one temperature model can no longer be used, and the two \n\ntemperatures model is introduced. This model assumes that each phase have a different local \n\ntemperature, and the coupling of the energy equations for both phases was formulated by \n\nseveral authors using averaged local volume, and reviewed by Kaviany [4] (Eqs. (2.7) and \n\n(2.8)).  \n\n       \n\n  \n                               \n\n                                    \n     \n\n               \n                    (2.7) \n\n       \n\n  \n                               \n\n                                 \n     \n\n                \n                     (2.8) \n\nThis formulation adds four total thermal diffusivity tensors    ,    ,    ,     and the \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient between fluid and solid phases,  . Total thermal \n\ndiffusivity tensors include the effective thermal conductivity tensor and the dispersion tensor. \n\nFour velocities appear in these equations, but only      have a simple interpretation, which is \n\nthe fluid velocity [3]. \n\nThere are different simplified models, where neglected terms are included in the convective \n\ncoefficient  , which is experimentally obtained for particular cases. Some simplified models \n\nfor a packed bed of spherical particles are proposed. The \u201cSchuman model\u201d is the simplest \n\none and the less accurate of the two temperatures models, only used for transient problems. It \n\nconsiders only convection between solid and fluid phases. The \u201cContinuous solid model\u201d \n\nincludes the effective thermal conductivities of solid and fluid phases, which must be \n\nexperimentally determined with the convective heat transfer coefficient. The \u201cDispersion-\n\nparticle-based model\u201d is the most complex and accurate one. It takes into account the thermal \n\ndispersion in the air, conduction into the solid particles, and convective heat transfer \n\ncoefficient in the interphase. It can be only used for transient state [4], but becomes a one \n\ntemperature model for steady state regime.  \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n \n\n1.3. Mass conservation and frost formation in a porous media \n\nUnlike the case of energy balance equation, mass conservation in a porous media is only \n\napplied for the fluid phase, and can be written as in Eq. (2.9). \n\n \n  \n\n  \n                     \n\n          (2.9) \n\nWhere   is the specie concentration,   is the Darcy velocity,      is the effective mass \n\ndiffusivity and       is the mass generation per unit volume of this specie. Analog to heat \n\ntransfer, the effective mass diffusivity is composed by the molecular diffusivity and the \n\ndispersion mass diffusivity. Mass diffusivity depends on pressure, temperature and \n\ncomposition of the species mixture. \n\nIn order to model mass transfer between fluid and solid phases, it could be consider in the \n\nsource term       as in Eq. (2.10). \n\n                                          (2.10) \n\nwhere    is the mass transfer convective coefficient,        is the specie concentration in the \n\nsolid surface and        is the specie concentration in the fluid. In cases of forced convection, \n\nthe mass transfer coefficient could be obtained from the heat transfer convective coefficient \n\nmaking use of the Lewis analogy, presented in Eq. (2.11). \n\n   \n \n\n          \n      with    \n\n \n\n  \n                  (2.11) \n\nwhere    is the Prandlt number exponent in the Nusselt equation for these conditions \n\n(geometry, fluid and flux), and varies between 0 and 1. A usual value is 1/3. \n\n2. Existing models \n\nThere are several works on heat and mass transfer models for a porous media. Laguerre et al. \n\n[5] studied the transient heat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres, and \n\ndeveloped a dispersed particle based model (including radiation between solid surfaces) and \n\ncompared it to direct CFD model and experimental values. Both models were in agreement \n\nwith the experimental values. The developed model for a packed bed requires less \n\ncomputational time than direct CFD, but it does not predict the details of the fluid flow and \n\ntemperature at pore scale. Beukema et al. [6] developed a two dimensional two phase model \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n \n\nof temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and storage of fresh agricultural \n\nproducts in cylindrical containers (porous media), subjected to natural convection. The model \n\nresults agree with experimental measures with potatoes. Dona and SewartJr [7] studied \n\nnumerically heat transfer by natural convection into a cylindrical grain bin which contained \n\nstored corn, with a porous media approach, and analyzed the effect of different container \n\naspect ratios. \n\nPham and Willix [8] developed simple equations to describe the ratio of desiccation of frozen \n\nfood, taking into account the dehydrate layer. Pham [9] presented equations and graphical \n\nmethods to predict the maximum possible moisture change between product and air. Tocci \n\nand Mascheroni [10] proposed a model for heat and mass transfer during the storage of frozen \n\nfood, to predict product (spheres) weight loss, using explicit finite difference methods. \n\nCampa\u00f1o et al. propose a numerical model [11] and a simple analytical model [12] for the \n\nprediction of weight loss during freezing and storage of unpacked frozen food, taking into \n\naccount the dehydrated varying layer in the product surface. They compare both, the \n\nnumerical and analytical models, to experimental data and among them. Weight loss during \n\nstorage depends on the freezing method, because of the mass transfer resistance of the \n\ndehydrate layer. They concluded that the weight loss is lower for lower temperatures, weight \n\nloss increase with air circulation and there is a linear increase of weight loss with relative \n\nhumidity [11]. \n\nAll authors agree to the fact that product weight loss increase with large amplitudes of \n\nfluctuations and low frequencies. In cases where package was used, it was found that it \n\nreduced product weight loss. However any of them studied the posterior frost formation. \n\nMost studies in modeling frost formation were developed for air coolers. In these conditions, \n\nit is important to predict the thickness of the frost layer as well as its density, since these \n\nfactors affect significantly the rate of heat transfer and the airflow through the fins. For \n\nexample, Wu et al. [13] developed a phase change mass transfer CFD model to predict the \n\nfrost layer growth and densification. They concluded that the averaged frost thickness \n\nincreased gradually with time, with the growth rate slowing down; and the average frost \n\ndensity increased with time, with the increases rate getting faster. \n\nFew works were found in the literature modeling heat and mass transfer and natural \n\nconvection flow into enclosure porous media, and even less particularly on frost formation in \n\nfrozen food porous media.  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n \n\n3. Proposed numerical model \n\n3.1. Problem description \n\nIn this section, a numerical model is proposed to predict airflow, heat and mass transfer and \n\nfrost formation into a close container with a bulk of frozen product, during the storage in a \n\ncold room. Exterior air temperature fluctuations, lead to product and air temperature \n\nvariations, natural convection airflow, and energy and water vapor transport from one region \n\nto another into the container. \n\nIn the industry, bulk product is storage into cubic pallets, cover by a plastic bag. The pallets \n\nare placed one above another forming towers into the cold room. For the model an \n\nintermediate container was taken, and it was assumed that the geometry was symmetric in the \n\ntop and in the bottom. In order to simplify the model, cubic containers were replaced by \n\ncylindrical ones. Figure 2.1 presents a scheme of the geometry used in the propose model. It is \n\ncompound by a cylindrical plastic container filled with frozen slices of carrots, perfectly \n\nisolated in the top and in the bottom (intermediate container). Product and air into the \n\ncontainer were model as a macroporous media. The cylinder is affected by the exterior air \n\ntemperature fluctuation only through the lateral wall. This geometry was chosen in order to \n\nsimplify the model and to reduce the simulation time. The calculation domain is shown in \n\nFigure 2.2.The model outputs will be the product and air temperatures, the rate of frost \n\nformation, and the cumulative frost during a period of time.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Scheme of the geometry used for the model. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2- Scheme of calculation domain. \n\n \n\nThe attention will be first drawn to the modeling assumptions: \n\n- The problem is axisymmetric, so a 2D model is implemented. Top and bottom of the \n\ncontainer are perfectly isolated.  \n\n- The airflow is considered as laminar. \n\n-  The Boussinesq approximation is used, since the change in air density is small within the \n\nworking temperature range. The density variation under natural convection regime is taken as \n\n                     for the buoyancy term. \n\n- Air thermal inertia is neglected in respect to the product thermal inertia: \n      \n\n          \n  . \n\n- Internal thermal resistance into carrots slices is neglected, since Biot number (calculated \n\nusing: frozen carrot conductivity at      :   \n \n\n  \n; convective heat transfer coefficient:  \n\n   \n \n\n   \n  and characteristic length: half of the thickness,       ) is           .  \n\n- Internal water mass transfer resistance into carrots is neglected. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n \n\n- Temperature at the container external lateral wall is known as a function of time, by \n\nmeasurements. \n\n- Radiation heat transfer is neglected inside the container. \n\n- The dispersion term in the energy equation for the porous medium is neglected, because of \n\nthe low fluid velocities. \n\n- Forchheimer term in momentum equation is neglected as the Reynolds number is smaller \n\nthan one [1] (simulated air velocity of         ; pore diameter         ; and air \n\nkinetic viscosity,               ). \n\n3.2. Governing equations \n\nThe following equations, momentum, energy and mass transfer will be solved according to \n\nthe previous assumptions. \n\n3.2.1. Continuity and Momentum equations \n\nContinuity and momentum equations are written for the fluid phase, assuming the Boussinesq \n\napproximation. The momentum equation integrates also the Darcy term for fluid flow in \n\nporous media. \n\n                \n\n (2.12) \n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n                      \n\n \n\n \n                               (2.13) \n\nwhere   is the porosity,    is the Darcy superficial air velocity into the porous medium,   is \n\nthe permeability of the porous media and   is the thermal coefficient of volumetric expansion. \n\n3.2.2. Energy \n\nEnergy equation is written for the air, Eq. (2.14), and for the product, Eq. (2.15). These \n\nequations are coupled by the convective heat transfer between air and product. The specific \n\nsurface,      , is defined as the total heat transfer surface of product over the bed volume of \n\nporous medium. \n\n      \n   \n\n  \n                  \n\n                                (2.14) \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n \n\n          \n   \n\n  \n     \n\n                    \n   \n\n  \n \n\n   \n\n  \n                  (2.15) \n\nwhere     is the equivalent conductivity of the carrots bed and   is the convective heat \n\ntransfer coefficient inside the container (product - air). Last term of Eq. (2.15) takes into \n\naccount latent heat of ice sublimation, where    and    are ice contents in frost and product \n\nper unit volume of porous medium respectively. \n\n3.2.3. Water mass balance \n\nTotal water mass balance inside product container is written as follows: \n\n            \n\n  \n                                      (2.16) \n\nwhere   , is water content in air and      is the vapor effective or total mass diffusivity in the \n\nporous media. \n\nEq. (2.17) describes the frost formation. If water concentration in air is higher than the \n\nsaturation limit at product temperature              , frost is formed.  \n\n   \n\n  \n                                         (2.17) \n\nEq. (2.18) describes product dehydration, which occurs when water vapor concentration in air \n\nis smaller than water vapor concentration in air in equilibrium with the product     \n\n        .  \n\n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \n\n  \n      \n\n                                      (2.18) \n\nIn these equations,    is the convective mass transfer coefficient, obtained by Lewis analogy \n\nfrom the convective heat transfer coefficient, and assuming that the airflow is imposed \n\nexternally for one single slice, and it could be consider as forced convection.       is the mass \n\ntransfer resistance at the vegetable skin, and    is the water activity of the product. For peeled \n\ncarrots, there is no skin resistance, but this term can be used to take into account the mass \n\ntransfer resistance due to the thin layer of dehydrated product near the surface [8, 10, 12, 13]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n \n\n3.3. Initial conditions \n\nAir mechanical and thermal inertia are small, and therefore initial air velocity can be assumed \n\nto be zero and initial air temperature can be considered equal to that of product. Product initial \n\ntemperature profile was obtained from initial temperature measurements at the center of the \n\ncontainer and near the wall, by interpolation. \n\nIt is assumed that initial water vapor concentration in air is zero (    ) and there is not frost \n\non product surface (     . Although the first one is a strong hypothesis, it haven\u2019t got \n\nrelevant effect in the model, because the elapsed time is long and air and product reaches \n\nequilibrium. \n\n3.4.

The \n\nheat flux at the lateral wall was obtained by measuring the external wall temperature, along \n\ncycles, and the heat transfer coefficient of the wall,  . In order to consider that the lateral wall \n\nwas in contact with air and product, each heat flux (wall/air, wall/product) was weighted with \n\nsurface fractions assuming an isotropic media (same values as volume fractions:        [1]. \n\nAs the container is completely close, there is not mass exchange between interior and exterior \n\nair, thought the walls. \n\n    \n  \n\n \n      \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n \n     \n\n                     (2.23) \n\nThe air velocity is zero on the container surfaces.  \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n \n\n        \n \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n                              (2.24) \n\n4.

Exterior air and product temperatures versus time, for \n\ndifferent exterior air temperature cycles: a. Cycle I. b. Cycle II. c. Cycle III. d. Cycle IV. \n\nAs can be seen, in all cycles, temperature varies into the domain only in radial direction, so \n\ntemperatures in the top and in the bottom are practically the same (      and      ). \n\nThis means that conduction heat transfer is dominant over natural convection heat transfer, as \n\nwas expected, since convective heat transfer coefficient is very low.

The effect of \n\nthermal inertia is observed in the gap between air and product fluctuations. Results could be \n\ncompared by taking the first cycle (I) as the reference one, and changing the mean \n\ntemperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation for the following three proposed cases.  \n\nAs it was expected, the increases of air temperature fluctuations keeping the same mean \n\ntemperature and frequency (comparison cycle I to II), lead to changes of the product \n\ntemperature, since there was an increase in the heat transfer rate. Comparing cycles I to III, it \n\nwas observed that the increase of the mean temperature, but keeping the same amplitude and \n\nfrequency of oscillation, caused the product to decrease its temperatures fluctuation, \n\nbecoming practically null. This can be explained by the change in thermal diffusivity, due to \n\napparent specific heat variation. Using the propose approach for apparent specific heat, and \n\ntaking into account that it is assumed a constant density and thermal conductivity of the \n\nproduct, the thermal diffusivity ranged from                at -18\u00baC to   \n\n              at -10\u00baC. In case of frequency increase, with the same mean temperature and \n\namplitude (comparison between cycles I to IV), product temperature fluctuations decreased, \n\nsince there was less time to perform the heat transfer. \n\nThe calculation of the total frost formed in the container was obtained from volume \n\nintegration in COMSOL, and plotted in Figure 2.5 for all cycles. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5-Simulation results, cumulative frost formation versus time for cycles I to IV.  \n\n \n\nA first observation is that frost formation displayed approximately a linear growth with time, \n\nindependently of mean temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation of exterior air. \n\nThis result was also found experimentally by Phimolsiripol et al. [14] and Pham et al. [15]. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that all these parameters have an important effect in \n\ntotal frost formed. Cycles could be compared, once again, taking cycle I as a reference, with \n\nthe aid of temperatures evolution in Figure 2.4. In cycle II, the amplitude of oscillation \n\nincreased two times in comparison to cycle I. As the total frost increase twice, it seems to be \n\ndirectly proportional to oscillation amplitude, as it was found in others works: Phimolsiripol \n\net al. [14], Poovarodom [16] and Laguerre and Flick [17]. In cycle III, the mean temperature \n\ndecrease to -10\u00baC, and total frost decrease approximately proportionally. It means that the \n\nsame temperature fluctuation (amplitude and frequency) have less effect on frost formation at \n\nhigher temperatures. This result could be explained by the change in product specific heat, \n\nwhich increases significantly between -18\u00baC to -10\u00baC due to the phase change. Laguerre and \n\nFlick [17] proposed a model that showed that, the higher the thermal inertia, the lower frost \n\nformation. In cycle IV frequencies increased twice respect to cycle I, and total frost formation \n\n0 \n\n0,01 \n\n0,02 \n\n0,03 \n\n0,04 \n\n0,05 \n\n0,06 \n\n0,07 \n\n0,08 \n\n0,09 \n\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 \n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n f\nro\n\nst\n f\n\no\nrm\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\n) \n\ntime (s) \n\nCycle I \n\nCycle II \n\nCycle III \n\nCycle IV \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n \n\ndecrease, since product temperature varies less than in cycle I. This result agrees with the one \n\nobtained by Poovarodom [16] and Laguerre and Flick [17]. Finally, it can be said that product \n\ntemperature variation had a very important effect on frost formation, increasing with each \n\nother.  \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nA model of heat and mass transfer was proposed in order to predict frost formation into a \n\nclosed container filled with frozen vegetables. The problem was study as a macroporous \n\nmedia compose by the product and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow was \n\nassumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model was developed in \n\nthe commercial software CFD COMSOL, and it was test imposing different exterior air \n\ntemperature fluctuations (boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were \n\ncompared, varying one by one: average temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation. \n\nAs general result it was observed that product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is \n\ndirectly associated with frost formation into the container. The bigger the product temperature \n\nvariation, the bigger the amount of frost formed. Frost formation increase with large \n\namplitude of oscillation, but decrease with higher frequencies and mean temperatures. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n \n\nBibliography \n\n[1] Donald A.

Products were modeled as a \n\nporous media. Parameters were obtained for two assembling: frozen slices of carrots and air, \n\nand frozen extra thin green beans and air. Parameter definition and evaluation combines \n\nliterature review, measurements and numerical simulation. They were classified in three \n\ntypes, as: the ones that only depend on thermophysical properties (product density and \n\napparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry (porosity, specific surface and \n\npermeability) and the ones that depend on both (equivalent conductivity and convective heat \n\ntransfer coefficient). In general, parameters which characterize these porous media, were \n\nsimilar for both products, even though they display different geometries. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: frozen food; macroporous media; vegetables; parameter identification.  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n \n\nIndex \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. Frozen food thermodynamic properties \n\nFood products, in particular vegetables, are mainly composed by water, around 90% (from \n\nChapter 9, ASHRAE [1]), and a small fraction of solved solids. The water freezing process \n\nreduces the liquid water fraction, inhibiting microorganism\u2019s growth and enzymatic activity. \n\nFood freezing have two important engineering aspects: the enthalpy change during freezing, \n\nand freezing time, which directly affects the product properties and its quality, in accordance \n\nto the ice crystallization into the product.  \n\nIn the study of frozen food, the water phase change must be taken into account. The presence \n\nof solved solids in product solution reduces the initial freezing point, in respect to pure water. \n\nThis behavior is important since there is not a unique phase change temperature as is shown in \n\nFigure 3.1.a. The scheme in Figure 3.1igure 3.1.b presents the food phase change process. \n\nOver the initial freezing point, the food product is compound by unfrozen water ( ) and \n\nsolids ( ). When the initial freezing point (  ) is achieved, a fraction of water becomes ice \n\n( ), and the solution, unfrozen water and solids (mainly sugar), increases its concentration \n\nreducing even more the solution freezing point. \n\n \n\n \n\na.        b. \n\nFigure 3.1 - a. Comparison of freezing curves for pure water and an aqueous solutions \n\ncontaining one solute; b. Schematic illustration of the phase change in a food product during \n\nfreezing. From Food Process Engineering [2]. \n\nThe energy embedded on a freezing process was predicted by Eq.(3.1) \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n \n\n                           (3.1) \n\nwhere      is the solid particles sensible enthalpy,     is the unfrozen water enthalpy,     is \n\nthe latent enthalpy and     is the ice water sensible enthalpy, defined as follows: \n\n                                    (3.2) \n\n                                         (3.3) \n\n                         (3.4) \n\n                              (3.5) \n\nWhere   and     are the mass fraction and specific heat of each phase, and   ,    and   are \n\ninitial temperature, product initial freezing point and product temperature, respectively. \n\nIn terms    ,     and     , the mass fractions are temperature functions. Once product \n\ntemperature is lower than initial freezing point,     and     are temperature functions also. \n\nThese temperature dependences and the lack of knowledge about product composition, turns \n\ndifficult to calculate enthalpy changes. The enthalpy variation needed to reduce product \n\ntemperature under the initial freezing point could be measured by a calorimeter test \n\n(Differential Scanning Calorimetry). \n\nThere are different methods to take into account the latent heat in simulations, Pham [3] \n\nreview some of them: apparent specific heat method, enthalpy method and quasi-enthalpy \n\nmethod. In the apparent specific heat method, latent heat is merged with sensible heat to \n\nproduce a specific heat curve with a large peak around the freezing point. \n\n1.2. Macroporous media characteristics \n\nA porous medium is a material consisting on a fixed solid matrix with interconnected void \n\nspaces, called pores, whose interconnection allows fluid flow through the material. Porous \n\nmedia are characterized by geometric parameters as porosity    (void fraction), specific \n\nsurface          \n    (rate of interior solid matrix surface to total volume) and \n\npermeability        (hydraulic resistance). Equivalent thermal conductivity        \n       \n\nand interior convective heat transfer coefficient             depends on thermodynamic \n\nproperties of solid and fluid phases and geometric characteristics of the porous medium. \n\nIn case of an enclosure porous medias it can be defined the macroporous media as the one in \n\nwhich the ratio of container characteristic length to particle characteristic length is smaller \n\nthan 10. \n\nIn natural porous media, the porosity is in general smaller than 0.6. In common porous media \n\nit can vary close to limit values, 0 and 1. In the case of a bed of uniform spheres, porosity \n\nvaries between 0.2595 and 0.4764 [4]. \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe permeability for common porous materials can be found in a wide range of orders of \n\nmagnitude, from     to          [4]. Several authors proposed Eq. (3.6) to calculate the \n\npermeability of a packed bed of spheres, in respect to the porosity and particle diameter ( ). \n\nEach author found different values for the constant  , but all around 150 to 200 (Ben Amara \n\n[5]).  \n\n  \n    \n\n       \n            (3.6) \n\nHowever in our known there are no equations or experimental values for macroporous media \n\nwith particles of others geometries and it was not found experimental values for macroporous \n\nmedia. \n\nThe equivalent conductivity of a porous medium depends on the thermal conductivity of each \n\nphase, the structure of the solid matrix and the contact resistance between particles. The limit \n\nvalues of equivalent conductivity were obtained from the composite layer models [6], solid \n\nand fluid layers in parallel arrangement and in series arrangement. A rough and ready \n\nestimation could be made from the weighted geometric mean [4]. Others correlations were \n\nreviewed by Kaviany [7], like the Krupicza\u2019s correlation for the isotropic equivalent \n\nconductivity, obtained experimentally for a packed bed of particles. Table 3.1 summarizes \n\nsome different correlations to predict the equivalent conductivity.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Summary of correlations for the equivalent conductivity     of a porous media. \n\nModel  Correlation Remarks \n\nParallel[C]                  Maximum value \n\nSeries[C] \n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n     \n\n  \n Minimum value \n\nGeometric[B]       \n \n   \n\n     \n \n\n  and   same order \n\nof magnitude \n\nKrupiczka, reviewed \n\nby Kaviany [I] \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n                          \n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n          \n\n \n\nIn respect to the convective heat transfer coefficient into a porous media, Wakao and Kaguei \n\n[8] carried out a critically review of experimental values obtained for steady-state and \n\nunsteady-sate measurements. They re-evaluated the heat transfer coefficients, considering \n\nonly the data they found reliable, and proposed a Nusselt correlation as a function of the \n\nReynolds number. Alvarez [9] and Ben Amara et al. [10] measured experimentally the \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient into a macroporous media, in steady state regime, by \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n \n\nneglecting conduction and radiation between solid particles. They placed a sphere of high \n\nconductivity material into a packed bed of spheres of very small conductivity. An electrical \n\nresistance heated the sphere and temperature was measured by a thermocouple, assuming \n\nuniform temperature. Alvarez [9] established a Nusselt correlation for turbulent flow. Ben. \n\nAmara et al. [10] studied the influence of the operational parameters on the convective \n\ncoefficient, and proposed a correlation for Reynolds in the range from 74 to 495 (low \n\nvelocities), similar to the one proposed for Wakao and Kaguei.  \n\nBen Amara et al. [10] performed an experimental study of convective heat transfer during \n\ncooling with low air velocity in a stack of objects. They found that for low velocities \n\n(<0.2m/s) radiation and conduction could be of the same order of magnitude as convection. \n\nThere were several researches working with porous media, in general with spherical particles. \n\nHowever, few researches had been carried out the characterization and identification of \n\nmacroporous media parameters, even less for confined porous media at very low air velocity. \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\nIn this work, the porous media consists on frozen product and air. Properties and parameters \n\nof two porous media were determined by different ways, as it was explained in this section. \n\n2.1. Products \n\nTwo types of frozen vegetables were studied: sliced carrots and extra thin green beans. These \n\nwere chosen because they were the most susceptible to damage during frozen storage. For all \n\nmeasures and experiments, products were prepared from fresh vegetables. \n\n2.1.1. Carrot \n\nFrozen slices of carrots were prepared from fresh carrots, peeled, cut, and frozen in a freezer \n\nat temperature of      . \n\nStandard dimensions in the industry are diameter between       and      , and thickness \n\nbetween      and     . \n\nA sample of 100 carrot slices was taken to measure their average diameter and thickness, with \n\nthe correspondent uncertainties:             and            respectively. \n\n2.1.2. Green beans \n\nFresh extra thin green beans were prepared by removing the beans tips and then frozen at \n\n     . \n\nStandard dimensions in the industry are diameter between        and     , and length \n\nbetween       and 120  . \n\nSample of 50 green beans was taken to measure their average diameter and length, with the \n\ncorrespondent uncertainties:            and              respectively. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2.2. Frozen product properties \n\n2.2.1. Product density \n\nFrozen product density was difficult to be measure experimentally, since it was not possible to \n\nuse water, because it melts the product. For this work, product density was calculated using \n\nEq. (3.7) and composition data from [1], for food products. Density depends on product \n\ncomposition and its mass fraction. \n\n  \n \n\n \n  \n  \n\n            (3.7) \n\nwhere    was the mass fraction and    the density of each component (water, protein, fat, \n\ncarbohydrate and ash). Density of each component and therefore product density depends on \n\ntemperature.  \n\n2.2.2. Enthalpy of phase change - Apparent specific heat \n\nA Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of carrots was performed using the \n\nequipment Metter Toledo DSC 822e by a thermo analytical technique in which the difference \n\nin the amount of heat power (    required to increase the temperature of a sample and a \n\nreference, is measured as a function of temperature. \n\nSamples for the calorimetry test were prepared from fresh product. Approximately     \n\nsample of product was placed in an aluminum pan, hermetically closed. Sample weight was \n\nrecorded and then subjected to the DSC. Measures were made in the temperature range \n\nbetween       and     , with a speed of           . \n\nFinally, the DSC software returned values of heat power versus temperature. The apparent \n\nspecific heat of phase change could be obtained by Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9). \n\n      \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n             (3.8) \n\n      \n   \n  \n\n \n \n\n            (3.9) \n\n2.3. Porous media characteristics \n\n2.3.1. Product bulk porosity \n\nThe porosity of a porous medium was defined as the ratio between air volume and total bed \n\nvolume.  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n                     (3.10) \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n \n\nIn an isotropic porous media, surface porosity is equal to volumetric porosity. A porous media \n\ninto a container with rigid and impermeable walls increase its porosity near the walls, because \n\nsolid particles are unable to pack together as efficiency as elsewhere. Experiments have \n\nshown that the porosity is a damped oscillatory function of the distance from the wall, varying \n\nfrom a value near unity at the wall to nearly core value at about five particle diameters from \n\nthe wall [4]. \n\nPorosity was measured using a container filled with product. The void volume was obtained \n\nby measuring the water volume that was possible to put into the container up to complete it. \n\n2.3.2. Specific surface \n\nThe specific surface is the ratio between product total heat transfer surface and product bed \n\nvolume.  \n\n      \n  \n\n    \n                     (3.11) \n\nTo determine the specific surface, the number of frozen product pieces was counted in a \n\nknown volume. Then, using the averaged product dimensions presented in sections 2.1.1 and \n\n2.1.2, total heat transfer surface was calculated. Knowing the container volume, the specific \n\nsurface could be calculated. \n\n2.3.3. Bulk product permeability \n\nThe permeability of a porous media is a parameter that depends on the geometry, but not on \n\nthe fluid. An experimental bench was used to estimate the permeability of a product bed, \n\nsubmitted to very low flow velocities, comparable in order of magnitude to the natural \n\nconvection ones. \n\nThe experimental device (Figure 3.2) was composed by a PVC suction duct of square section \n\nwith dimensions                     , filled with product.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 -Scheme of experimental device used for permeability measure. \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe airflow was controlled by a variable frequency drive (SSD Drives 650) connected to the \n\nfan and with a valve installed in the discharge line. An Annubar (AWR-71) connected to an \n\ninclined tube manometer was used to measure airflow, and therefore the superficial velocity \n\nin the suction duct was obtained. The pressure drop in the carrots bed was measure with \n\nanother inclined tube manometer. The range of velocities used varied between             \n\nand            , the same order of magnitude of natural convection ones.  \n\nThe same method was previously used by Ben Amara [5] to measure product permeability. \n\nThe momentum equation for a porous media, assuming the Bousinesq approximation and \n\nincompressible flow is similar to Navier Stokes but adding the Darcy and Forchheimer terms. \n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n                \n\n \n\n \n                   \n\n         \n\n  \n              (3.12) \n\nWhere   was the porosity,   the permeability and   the Forchheimer coefficient. Since the \n\nexperimental velocities were very small, the Forchheimer term became negligible in respect to \n\nthe Darcy term.  The air temperature was the same as the reference one (       ), so the \n\nmass force term could be neglected too. Under these conditions, and assuming steady state \n\nregime, momentum equation was reduced to Darcy's equation, Eq. (3.13). Eq. (3.14) was a \n\nunidirectional version of Darcy\u2019s. \n\n       \n \n\n \n                          (3.13) \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n                      (3.14) \n\nIn these conditions, the permeability was determined making use of Eq. (3.14), by measuring \n\npressure drop through a bulk product bed for different velocities. The experiment was \n\nrepeated at least twice for each vegetable. \n\n2.3.4. Equivalent conductivity \n\nIn this work the equivalent conductivity of the frozen product bed was identified from \n\nexperimental measures, in the absence of convection, with a unidirectional transient pure \n\nconductive model in COMSOL. \n\nA polyurethane box of      of thickness in the lateral walls and      in the bottom, was use \n\nto contain the product. The interior dimensions were length, width and height, 15,5cm x \n\n10,7cm x 9,5cm respectively. In the top of the box a thin steel plate was placed. Three pieces \n\nof product (slices of carrot or green beans) were fixed exactly at known positions into the box, \n\nat different heights and centered, and connected to thermocouples, as it is shown in Figure \n\n3.3. Product and steel plate temperatures were measured by type T thermocouples \n\n(copper/constantan) connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-08) and a computer. \n\nA eutectic substance (PCM) with a phase change temperature of the order of -10\u00baC was used \n\nto heat up the top surface of the box. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 -Scheme of experimental device used for conductivity measurement. \n\nFrozen product was placed in an insulated box at uniform initial cold temperature of \n\napproximately -20\u00b0C. The box was then placed in the freezer at -20\u00b0C, and the measurement \n\nstarted when the box was heated from the top with the PCM, allowing to impose a constant \n\ntemperature (-10\u00baC) over the steel plate. Product and steel plate temperatures were measured \n\nalong two hours. The experiment was repeated twice. \n\nThis configuration (heating from the top), which does not generate any natural convection, \n\nwas modeled in COMSOL considering unidirectional conductive heat transfer in transient \n\nregime, eq. (3.15).  \n\n          \n   \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n                   (3.15) \n\nImposed temperature at the top (measured experimentally   ) and no heat flux at the bottom \n\nof the box, were taken as boundary conditions. The equivalent conductivity of the porous \n\nmedium was obtained by comparing the temperature from the model to the measured one, and \n\nthe least square method was used to find the best conductivity value.  \n\n2.3.5. Convective heat transfer coefficient into the porous media \n\nWith the objective of obtain an order of magnitude of the air-product natural convective heat \n\ntransfer coefficient into a container, a transient experiment was mounted. The method was \n\nsimilar to the one reported by Alvarez [9] and Ben Amara [10] for macroporous media. \n\nA cylindrical plastic container with         of diameter and         of height, isolated with \n\n     polystyrene at the top and at the bottom (Figure 3.4), was filled with frozen product.  \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Scheme of experimental device used for convective coefficient estimation. \n\nAn aluminum probe with dimensions close to the ones of product (diameter         and \n\nthickness        for carrots; diameter        and length         for green beans) and \n\nequipped with a type T thermocouple, was introduce into the container with an initial \n\ntemperature hotter that the device. The probe was surrounded by isolated objects, such as \n\npolystyrene slices for carrots and hollow plastic tubes for green beans, chose to avoid thermal \n\ncontact between the probe and frozen product (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5). Under these \n\nconditions, it was assumed that convection was the unique heat transfer phenomenon affecting \n\nthe aluminum slice. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Experimental device used for convective coefficient estimation, for each \n\nvegetable. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe aluminum probe temperature variation and that of the surrounding air were measured \n\nduring the transient heat transfer experiment.  \n\nAs the aluminum conductivity was higher and the natural convection heat transfer coefficient \n\nwas low, the Biot number (calculated using aluminum conductivity:            ; \n\nconvective heat coefficient:             and characteristic length as half of the \n\nthickness:       ) was smaller than    , allowing to assume a unique temperature in the \n\nmetallic slice. Therefore, the transient equation neglecting internal thermal resistance could be \n\napplied assuming a constant air temperature. Eq. (3.16) was used as follows: \n\n             \n       with   \n\n   \n\n  \n                 (3.16) \n\nWhere  ,   and    are heat transfer surface, mass and specific heat of the aluminum slice \n\nrespectively;     is the air temperature;    is the aluminum initial temperature and   the slice \n\ntemperature varying with time. \n\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient could be calculated by adjusting the experimental \n\npoints with the aid of an exponential trend curve. \n\n3. Results \n\nIn the governing equations for our model, presented in Chapter II, some parameters were not \n\nknown and must be obtained from literature, calculated, measured or identified, to perform \n\nthe simulation.

To simplify, it was assumed that all \n\nwater was in solid phase. \n\nTable 3.3 - Vegetables composition and density of each component as a function of \n\ntemperature, from [1]. \n\nComponents \n\nCarrots \n\nMass fraction \n\n(%) \n\nGreen beans \n\nMass fraction \n\n(%) \n\nDensity      \n\n        \n\nWater (ice)                                     \n\nProtein                                   \n\nFat                                   \n\nCarbohydrate                                   \n\nFiber                                 \n\nAsh                                   \n\n \n\nComponent density varies with temperature. However, for the working range of temperatures \n\n(       to      ), the calculated values varied slightly, less than 0.2%, so it was assumed a \n\nconstant density. By taking       as the reference temperature, the carrot density was found \n\nto be            \n   and             \n\n   for green beans. \n\n3.2. Apparent specific heat \n\nThere was not a unique phase change temperature in food products, since water was not pure, \n\nas it carried dissolved solids. This means that there was a range of temperatures (between \n\napproximately -1\u00baC and -18\u00baC) in which coexisted sensible and latent heat. The concept of an \n\napparent specific heat allows for taking into account these combined phenomena. \n\nFigure 3.6 presents the experimental values of heat power versus temperature, for a        \n\nsample. The shape of the curve presents the typical peak in the temperature range of phase \n\nchange, similar to the one predicted by the apparent specific heat in Figure 3.7. However, the \n\ninitial freezing point did not occur in the expected value, and it was slightly shifted to the \n\nright.  \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 -Experimental curve from DSC measure, for carrots. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Apparent specific heat from Food Process Engineering [2] \n\n0,00 \n\n1,00 \n\n2,00 \n\n3,00 \n\n4,00 \n\n5,00 \n\n6,00 \n\n7,00 \n\n8,00 \n\n9,00 \n\n10,00 \n\n-40,00 -30,00 -20,00 -10,00 0,00 10,00 20,00 30,00 \n\nP\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr \n(m\n\nW\n) \n\nTemperature (\u00b0C) \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n \n\nPhase change enthalpy was obtained by curve fitting, with the aid of Eqs.

As it was expected, the porosity varies depending on the volume of the container \n\nand its geometry, mainly near the walls. \n\nThe porosity was evaluated by measuring the void volume of the porous media with water. \n\nThe values obtained were         for carrots and          for green beans.

Equivalent conductivity \n\nTo identify the equivalent thermal conductivity of each bulk of products (carrots and green \n\nbeans) the thermal experiment described in section 2.3.4 was performed, repeated twice for \n\neach vegetable as shown in Figure 3.14. \n\n0,0 \n\n5,0 \n\n10,0 \n\n15,0 \n\n20,0 \n\n25,0 \n\n30,0 \n\n35,0 \n\n0,00 0,02 0,04 0,06 0,08 0,10 0,12 0,14 \n\n-D\nP\n\n/L\n (\n\nP\na\n\n/m\n) \n\nVelocity (m/s) \n\nExperimental  \n\nLinear \n(Experimental ) \n-DP/L=227.13v \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 - Comparison between temperatures measured in experiments 1 (Exp 1) and 2 \n\n(Exp 2), for carrot slices. \n\nA unidirectional conduction model was implemented in COMSOL software, with data from \n\nproduct density, product specific heat and porosity, calculated earlier in this work. \n\nIn order to estimate the range of equivalent conductivity, it was evaluate for the limit \n\nconditions, parallel and series arranged of air and product by using equations from Table 3.1. \n\nThe limit values for carrot slices were                   \n             , and \n\n                  \n               for green beans. \n\nSimulations were carried out by sweeping the equivalent conductivity in these ranges. Figure \n\n3.15 shows the comparison between experimental measures and simulation results for carrot \n\nslices, for an imposed equivalent conductivity of     \n             . As it can be seen, \n\nthe general shape of temperature evolution for different positions was similar. However, it \n\nwas not possible to adjust all temperatures for the same value of equivalent conductivity. This \n\nwas probably due to the porosity variation near the wall, which was not taken into account by \n\nthe model since a uniform porosity was assumed for the entire domain.

Conclusion \n\nParameters can be classified in three types: the ones which depend only on thermophysical \n\nproperties (product density and apparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry \n\n(porosity, specific surface and permeability) and the ones which depends on both (equivalent \n\nconductivity and convective heat transfer coefficient). From the results, summarized in Table \n\n3.5, it can be seen that parameters in the first case, were similar for both vegetables since they \n\nwere compose mainly by water (carrots 87.79% and green beans 90.27%). Green beans \n\ndensity is 2% smaller than carrot density. Pure geometric parameters were of the same order \n\nof magnitude for both porous media, but were a bit bigger for green beans than for carrots. It \n\nwas not strange since product geometries were completely different. Green beans porosity \n\nwas 18% bigger, specific surface was 33% bigger and permeability was 14% bigger, respect \n\nto carrots. These results appear to be in concordance, since the biggest the porosity, the \n\nbiggest the permeability. In case of the last two parameters, equivalent conductivity and \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient, the results were of the same order of magnitude. \n\nHowever, the equivalent conductivity varied more significantly, since it is directly related \n\nwith the geometric appearance. As the porosity is smaller for carrots, there were more \n\nvegetables per bed volume, leading to a higher conductivity, and less air with lower \n\nconductivity. That situation explained the equivalent conductivity augmentation on 28.5%. In \n\nthe case of convective coefficient, differences in geometric characteristics appear not to have \n\na large impact. Fluid (air) and solid phases in porous media have similar thermal properties, \n\nand finally the convective coefficients were practically the same (7% higher for carrots bed). \n\nIn general, parameters which characterize these porous media were similar for both products, \n\neven though the different geometries.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n \n\nBibliography \n\n[1] ASHRAE Handbook\u2014Refrigeration, Chapter 9: Thermal properties of food, 2006. \n\n[2] Dennis R.

Introduction \n\nIn the frozen food industry, in particular for vegetables, products are frozen and bulk stored \n\ninto box pallets at low temperature in cold rooms. Storage duration can range from few \n\nmonths up to one year, before market distribution. During that long-term storage, frozen \n\nproducts may be exposed to air temperature fluctuations that can impact product quality. \n\nThereafter, losses can be expected due to a poor management of storage environmental \n\nconditions. \n\nA number of studies in the literature have shown the effect of both, temperature fluctuations \n\nand heterogeneity, on product quality. Quality losses and kinetics degradation such as vitamin \n\nC, color and drip loss are often considered an important issue to be reduced (Martins et al. [1], \n\nTheofania Tsironi et al. [2]). \n\nFrost formation during storage of frozen food is also one of major industrial problems. \n\nExperimental studies (Poovarodom [3]) have been dedicated to analyze the influence of \n\ntemperature changes in average, amplitude and frequency of fluctuations. Laguerre and Flick \n\n[4] studied experimentally frost formation on packed bed of potato and melon balls inside \n\nhermetic boxes, stored in domestic freezers. They proposed a qualitative simplified model to \n\nexplain the observed phenomena. These models showed that frost was developed whenever \n\nthe temperature was low inside the box and/or its fluctuation was also low. They observed \n\nless frost in more insulated boxes, less frost at higher frequency and lower amplitude of \n\nexterior air temperature variation, and less frost for potatoes than for melon balls due to the \n\nlower surface water activity. \n\nDesiccation of frozen food during storage has been studied by several authors [5 - 9], that \n\ngenerally admit that both, large amplitude of fluctuations and low frequencies, increase \n\nweight loss in product. \n\nPallet boxes may be heated or cooled due to external air fluctuation along the storage period, \n\ncausing the product to change from one position to another inside the pallet, followed by \n\nvariations on the pallet inside air temperature. Close to the external walls, product and air \n\ntemperature can be submitted to more intense changes than the ones in the core of the pallet, \n\ndue to thermal inertia. Water from warmer product is sublimated, transported by the air and \n\nfinally deposited at the cooler frozen surfaces, where frost formation occurs.  \n\nFew works in literature report natural convection in food stacks. Laguerre et al. [10] studied \n\nthe transient heat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres in a refrigerated \n\ncavity. They proposed a porous media approach and compared it with direct CFD method and \n\nexperimental measures. The numerical results obtained with both approaches were in good \n\nagreement with the experimental values. CFD approach required more computational time, \n\nand the proposed approach did not predict in detail the fluid flow patterns and temperature at \n\npore scale. Evaporative mass transfer inside bulks submitted to natural convection was studied \n\nby Beukema et al. [11]. They developed a two dimensional and two phase model (product-air) \n\nto predict temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and bulk storage of fresh \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n \n\nagricultural products in a cylindrical container. They validated the proposed model with \n\nexperimental values for potatoes during long time periods. \n\nDespite the importance of frost formation during storage of frozen food, there is little work on \n\nthe modeling of the coupled phenomena: airflow, heat transfer and mass transfer for bulk of \n\nfrozen food porous media under natural convection. \n\nThe objective of this chapter is to establish and validate a numerical model able to predict \n\nairflow, heat transfer and frost formation in a cylindrical container filled with bulk frozen \n\nvegetables (slices of carrots) exposed to temperature fluctuations. Parameters were obtained \n\nfrom literature or by experimental identification, and the model was validated by performing \n\nindependent experiments. \n\n2. Numerical modeling \n\nIn this section, a numerical model is proposed to predict airflow, heat and mass transfer and \n\nfrost formation into a close container with a bulk of frozen product, during the storage in a \n\ncold room. Figure 4.1 depicts the cylindrical container filled with slices of carrots, used in the \n\nproposed model. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Simulation domain for the numerical simulation of airflow, heat and mass \n\ntransfer and frost formation filled with slices of carrots. \n\nThe container lateral wall was meant to be built with plastic material, and top and bottom \n\nsurfaces were perfectly insulated. That imposition, although not physically realistic, may \n\nrepresent an intermediate sample of frozen products within a pallet tower, placed inside the \n\ncold room.  \n\nProduct and air inside the container were model as a macroporous media. The container was \n\nsubmitted to air temperature fluctuation only through the lateral wall. This geometry was \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n \n\nchosen in order to simplify the model and to reduce the simulation time, and the calculation \n\ndomain is shown in Figure 4.2.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Scheme of calculation domain of the cylindrical container. \n\nThe model outputs will be the product and air temperatures, the rate of frost formation, and \n\nthe cumulative frost during a period of time.  \n\nModeling assumptions are as follows: \n\n- The problem was axisymmetric, suitable to a 2D modeling. Container top and bottom \n\nsurfaces were assumed to be perfectly insulated. \n\n- The container inside airflow was considered as laminar. \n\n-  The Boussinesq approximation was assumed, since the air density variation was very small \n\nwithin the working temperature range. The air density variation under natural convection \n\nregime was taken as                      for the buoyancy term. \n\n- Air thermal inertia was neglected in respect to product thermal inertia: \n      \n\n          \n  . \n\n- Internal thermal resistance into carrot slices was neglected, since the predicted Biot number \n\nwas 0.0042, smaller than the usual limit (0.1).

Governing equations \n\nThe following equations, momentum, energy and mass transfer were solved according to the \n\nprevious assumptions. \n\n2.1.1. Momentum \n\nContinuity and momentum equations were used assuming the Boussinesq approximation. The \n\nmomentum equation integrates also the Darcy term for fluid flow in porous media. \n\n                  (4.1) \n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n                      \n\n \n\n \n                      (4.2) \n\nwhere    is the porosity,    the Darcy superficial air velocity into the porous medium,   the \n\nporous media permeability and   the thermal coefficient of volumetric expansion. \n\n2.1.2. Energy \n\nEnergy equation was written for the air, Eq. (4.3), and for the product, Eq. (4.4), and coupled by the \n\nconvective heat transfer between them. The specific surface,      , was defined as the \n\ntotal heat transfer surface of carrots over bed volume of porous medium. \n\n      \n   \n\n  \n                  \n\n                       (4.3) \n\n          \n   \n\n  \n     \n\n                    \n   \n\n  \n \n\n   \n\n  \n         (4.4) \n\nwhere     is the equivalent conductivity of carrots bed and   the convective heat transfer \n\ncoefficient inside the container.

Although there \n\nis not skin resistance on peeled carrots, this term was used to take into account the mass \n\ntransfer resistance due to the thin layer of dehydrated product near the surface [5, 9, 12, 13]. \n\n2.2. Initial conditions \n\nMechanical and thermal inertia of air were very small, allowing to assume initial air velocity \n\nto be zero and initial air temperature to be equal to that of the product. Product initial \n\ntemperature profile was obtained by data interpolation from initial temperature measurements \n\nat the center of the container and near its wall. \n\nIt was assume that air initial vapor concentration was zero (    ) and there was no frost on \n\nproduct surface (      . \n\n2.3.

Bulk product porosity \n\nThe porosity  of a porous medium is defined as the ratio of air volume to the total bed \n\nvolume, and was evaluated by measuring the void volume of the porous media with water. \n\nThe obtained value was       . \n\n2.4.2. Specific surface \n\nThe specific surface is the ratio of total heat transfer surface of product to the bed volume. To \n\ndetermine the specific surface, a sample of 100 frozen carrot slices were measured at      . \n\nThe specific surface calculated from these values was            \n   (diameter:      \n\n       and thickness:           ).  \n\n2.4.3. Product density \n\nProduct density   was calculated using the equation and composition data from Chapter 9, \n\nASHRAE Handbook [14], Thermal properties of foods, neglecting product porosity. \n\n  \n \n\n \n  \n  \n\n                    (4.14) \n\nwhere    was the mass fraction and    the density of each component (water, protein, fat, \n\ncarbohydrate and ash). The calculated values slightly depend on temperature, and for the \n\nreference temperature of -15\u00b0C the carrot density was            . \n\n2.4.4. Product specific heat \n\nAn apparent specific heat       was used, Eq. (4.15), based on the enthalpy method [15].  \n\n                 \n  \n\n  \n                  (4.15) \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n \n\nwhere      (         \n   [14]) was the specific heat of a completely frozen product,    \n\n(       [14]) was the product water content,       (         ) was the water latent heat of \n\nfusion. The   function varies from 0 (completely frozen) to 1 (unfrozen) within a temperature \n\nrange of 10 \u00b0C (from          to        , the initial freezing point [14]). \n\n2.4.5. Bulk product permeability \n\nBulk product permeability was identified for a one-dimensional flow, using a method \n\npreviously reported by Ben Amara [16]. An experimental workbench was built (Figure 4.3) \n\nfor that task, where slices of carrots were placed on a square section PVC suction duct \n\n(                    ). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 -Experimental workbench built to measure bulk product permeability. \n\nAirflow rate and its superficial velocity were measured at the fan discharge with an Annubar \n\nflow meter (OxitrolAWR-71), connected to an inclined tube manometer. The pressure drop \n\ngenerated by the bulk product bed (0.4 m in length) was measured with an inclined tube \n\nmanometer (+/- 0.1 Pa). Very low velocities were promoted for this experiment, similar in \n\norder of magnitude to the ones under natural convection. \n\nUnder these conditions, the momentum equation becomes the Darcy`s equation, assuming \n\nsteady state and air at reference temperature (       ).  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n                      (4.17) \n\nAir velocity ranged from            to            and the corresponding pressure drop is \n\ndisplayed in Figure 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Experimental pressure drops in respect to air velocity in a carrot bed and its linear \n\nfitting. \n\nThe permeability calculated from these data was               . \n\n2.4.6. Equivalent conductivity \n\nThe equivalent or effective conductivity of the bulk of frozen carrots was identified by \n\nsolving a one dimensional conduction model, validated experimentally. Frozen carrots were \n\nplaced in an insulated box (Figure 4.5) its top wall made of a steel plate.  \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Insulated box built to acquire data to calculate the equivalent or effective \n\nconductivity of the bulk of frozen carrots. \n\nA single type T thermocouple was introduced in the inside of a slice of carrot placed at the \n\ncenter of the bulk and at the steel plate, and connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-\n\n08). The box was kept 24 hours at stable temperature of -20\u00b0C and then heated from the top \n\nby a phase change material (-10\u00b0C), disposed over the steel plate. Sample temperatures were \n\nrecorded along 2 hours. \n\nTop heating allowed for avoiding natural convection inside the box.  A one directional and \n\ntransient heat conduction model was solved with COMSOL (Eq. 4.18) with adapted boundary \n\nconditions: imposed temperature at the top and no heat flux at the bottom of the box.   \n\n          \n   \n\n  \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n                   (4.18) \n\nEquivalent conductivity was then identified by a least square procedure, comparing \n\nexperimental temperatures and simulated ones, shown in Figure 4.6 for the equivalent \n\nconductivity of            \n     . \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Comparison between experimental and simulated temperatures versus time, to \n\ndetermine equivalent conductivity of the porous media. \n\n \n\nAnother way to estimate the equivalent conductivity for a porous media is given by the \n\nweighted geometric mean model [17], as follows.  \n\n          \n     \n\n       \n \n                   (4.19) \n\nThe equivalent conductivity     calculated by that last equation was            \n     , \n\nwith air conductivity                \n     , and frozen carrot conductivity         \n\n           . The calculated (            ) and identified equivalent (            ) \n\nconductivities were of the same order of magnitude.  \n\n2.4.7. Convective heat transfer coefficient \n\nA non-stationary method was employed in order to obtain an order of magnitude for the \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient between frozen slices and air inside the bulk of frozen \n\ncarrots, similar to the one reported previously by Alvarez [18] and Ben Amara et al. [19], and \n\ndepicted in Figure 4.7.   \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Experimental device used for convection coefficient measure \n\nMeasurements were carried out in a cylindrical plastic container (         diameter and \n\n        height) filled with frozen carrots, and isolated at the top and bottom with     of \n\npolystyrene layer. An aluminum slice (diameter:         and thickness:        ) was \n\nplaced in the center of the experimental device to act as a temperature probe, equipped with a \n\ncalibrated type T thermocouple. The probe at high temperature (20\u00b0C) was placed at the \n\ncenter of the bulk of frozen carrots at approximately -20\u00baC, surrounded by polystyrene slices \n\nof similar dimensions, in order to avoid heat conduction. Probe temperature   and air \n\ntemperature    were continuously acquired to allow for estimating the convective heat \n\ntransfer over the probe, as shown in Figure 4.8, for a temperature range of           \n\n   . \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n \n\n.  \n\nFigure 4.8 - Air and probe temperatures measured in the experimental device depicted in \n\nFigure 4.7. \n\nThe probe Biot number      was estimated to be less than 0.1 (aluminum \n\nconductivity            ; convective heat coefficient            and characteristic \n\nlength as half of slice thickness,       ).Once the probe could be modeled by a lumped \n\napproach, its uniform internal temperature T was expressed as follows, for a constant air \n\ntemperature: \n\n             \n       with   \n\n   \n\n  \n                 (4.20) \n\nwhere  ,  ,    and    are the slice heat transfer surface, mass, specific heat and initial \n\ntemperature respectively.  \n\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient was estimated from that approach, with a value of \n\n           . \n\n2.4.8. Heat transfer coefficient across the container wall \n\nThis coefficient took into account the conductive thermal resistance of the        thick \n\nplastic wall, with              thermal conductivity (ploypropylene). The wall heat \n\ntransfer coefficient was              . \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.4.9. Saturated vapor concentration \n\nSaturated vapor concentration was calculated from equation (4.23), assuming the air as an \n\nideal gas \n\n        \n        \n\n  \n                    (4.23) \n\nSaturated vapor pressure was calculated from Clapeyron equation. \n\n             \n \n     \n\n \n \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n                  (4.24) \n\nThe reference values used for pressure and temperature were               and      \n\n                 respectively and  was the water molar mass. \n\n2.4.10. Effective mass diffusivity \n\nThe effective mass diffusivity of the porous media      considers the molecular diffusivity \n\n(  ) and the dispersion term (  ). The second one appears to takes into account effects of \n\nmass transfer due to hydrodynamic mixing of the interstitial fluid at the pore scale. If Peclet \n\nnumber    defined as in Eq. (4.25) is lower than one, molecular diffusion dominates, and \n\notherwise mass dispersion cannot be neglected [20].  \n\n        \n    \n\n  \n                    (4.25) \n\n2.5. Numerical resolution \n\nThe set of differential equations was solved with the aid of COMSOL\u00ae CFD software \n\nrunning on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS computer in a PC Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz  \n\nwith 15.6 GB RAM. All calculated outputs, including temperatures and water contents, were \n\nperformed every 120 seconds, in accordance to the experiment time step.  \n\nThe discretization of the computational domain was done with COMSOL automatic meshing. \n\nPhysics-controlled mesh was employed, which consist on triangular and quadrilateral \n\nelements, with refined near walls. \u201cFine\u201d and \u201cFiner\u201d meshes were tested for the mesh \n\nindependence study. Table 4.2 shows the number of domain and boundary elements for each \n\nmesh. \n\nTable 4.2 - Elements number for different meshes. \n\nMesh /                      \n\nNumber of elements  \n\nFine Finer \n\n(F) (Fr) \n\nDomain elements 3501 8179 \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n \n\nBoundary elements 179 351 \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 presents the maximum difference between the values of temperature (   ) and \n\nfrost formed (    ) obtained from the simulation of one day (24 hours) of an impose \n\ntemperature cycle (cycle 1presented in section 3.4), with both meshes. \n\nTable 4.3 - Results comparison between meshes fine and finer. \n\nMaximum difference          \n        \n\n    \n     \n\nTemperature 0.092 \u00baC 0.05% \n\nFrost formed  0.00059 g 0.21% \n\n \n\nAs it can be seen, the temperature variations were very small in respect to the order of \n\nmagnitude of the measured values. The maximum difference in frost formation \n\nrepresented      of the total frost formed during one day. After that, it was assumed that \n\nresults were independent of the mesh refinement so a \u201cFine\u201d mesh was used. The \n\ncharacteristics of this mesh were: 3233 triangular elements, 268 quadrilateral elements, \n\nminimum element quality 0.121 and average element quality 0.8824. \n\n3. Materials and methods \n\nIn order to evaluate the influence of temperature variation on frost formation, containers filled \n\nwith frozen carrots were placed sequentially in different freezers. \n\n3.1. Product \n\nThis study was carried out using fresh commercial grade carrots. Frozen slices were prepared \n\nout of fresh carrots, peeled, cut, and frozen in a freezer at temperature of -30\u00b0C. The averaged \n\nslices dimensions were mentioned in section 2.4.2. \n\n3.2. Containers \n\nCarrots were storage in cylindrical plastic (polypropylene 5) containers of       (diameter   \n\n       ; height          ; wall thickness         ). These containers were insulated \n\nat the top and bottom with        thick expanded polystyrene (             ). \n\nCarrotswere disposed in the container into four separated regions (A, B, C, D) made with \n\nsemi rigid plastic grids of the same volume (Figure 4.9). These sets up allowed do generate a \n\ncentral zone separated from a peripheral one; and in two levels, to perform the analysis of \n\nwater migration into the container. \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Plastic grids used into the container to measure frost in each region. \n\nSome carrots slices in the container were equipped with thermocouples, allowing to measure \n\nthe temperature at the center of regions A and C, and near to the surface in regions B and D. \n\nWall and exterior air temperatures were also measure. \n\n3.3. Freezers \n\nThree commercial freezers were used, set to the temperatures of            ,       \n\n      and           .  \n\n3.4. Temperature cycles \n\nExperiments were carried out with two different air temperature cycles (Table 4.4), which \n\nwere performed daily for a two month long period, except for the weekends. \n\nTable 4.4 - Temperature cycles 1 and 2 \n\nCycle \nSet point 1 \n\n(\u00b0C) \n\ntime 1 \n\n(h) \n\nSet point 2 \n\n(\u00b0C) \n\ntime 2 \n\n(h) \n\n1 -18.0 23 -5.5 1 \n\n2 -18.0 18 -12.8 6 \n\n \n\nCycle 1 kept the container in the freezer at        and one hour a day it climbed        ; \n\nCycle 2 kept the container in the freezer at the same        and six hour a day at         . \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n \n\nProduct, wall and exterior air temperatures were measured for each temperature cycle, using \n\nthermocouples type T (copper/constantan) connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-\n\n08) and a computer.  \n\n3.5. Frost formation \n\nFrost formation was measured weekly by weight loss for the four regions (A, B, C, D) during \n\nthe two month of temperature cycling. To evaluate weight loss, containers were opened in a \n\nlow temperature room (     ), and each region was removed separately and was shacked \n\nduring 30 seconds to remove the frost formed on carrots surface. Frost was deposited over an \n\nabsorbent paper and then it is weighted using a balance of high precision (       ).  \n\nThe drawbacks of this method are that it may have errors due to several issues, like \n\nenvironmental influences, handling operation or hysteresis effects due to frost removal on \n\neach measure. On the other hand, this method is extremely simple, cheap and easily \n\nimplemented. \n\n4. Results \n\nThe cycles 1 and 2 used for the experimental measurements were simulated using the \n\nproposed model and imposing the container wall temperature measure experimentally during \n\nthe cycles, as a boundary condition. Results from experiments and simulations were analyzed \n\nand compared to validate the model. A study of the effect of the identified parameters in the \n\nmodel was done. Finally an estimation of frost formed in real conditions is present. \n\n4.1. Temperature \n\nProduct temperatures were measured into the container in the center of each region as \n\ndescribed in section 3. Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11 shows simulated and measured \n\ntemperature evolution over time, for cycles 1 and 2, respectively.  \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 - Comparison between experimental and simulated temperatures for cycle 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 - Comparison between experimental measured and simulated temperatures for \n\ncycle 2. \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n \n \n\nFrom the last figures can be observed a good agreement between experimental values and \n\nsimulated ones, as they show the same behavior. Nevertheless, simulated temperatures only \n\nvary along the radial direction (      and      ). Experimental temperatures show slight \n\ndifferences between top and bottom of the container. Temperature differences       and \n\n      varied with time and it was smaller than    . This can be explained by differences in \n\nexperimental insulation between top and bottom. Indeed the shape of the container lid could \n\ngenerate a thermal resistance at the upper surface. Despite similar thermal behavior from \n\nsimulations and experimental measures, the simulated temperature curves were always \n\nslightly higher than the experimental ones. Table 4.5 presents the maximum deviation \n\nbetween simulated and measured temperatures for each cycle. The biggest differences were \n\n      for cycle 1 and       for cycle 2, which represents an error less than 12% and 8% \n\nrespectively, respect to experimental temperatures in \u00baC. \n\n \n\nTable 4.5 - Maximum difference between experimental and numerical values of temperatures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn cycle 1 (Figure 4.10), product near the wall quickly changed its temperature, following the \n\nbehavior of the wall temperature. During the first hour, the product was heated from the wall \n\nand its temperature was smaller than the one at the wall. Product temperature increases fast \n\nbecause of the temperature difference between product and wall. After one hour, when the \n\ncontainer returns to the freezer at      , wall temperature decreases and product was hotter \n\nthan the wall and there was a heat flux in the opposite direction. Product temperature \n\ndecreases slowly because temperature difference between product and wall was smaller than \n\nduring the first hour. Product in the center (A, D) changes its temperature more slowly and \n\nthere was a delay due to the thermal inertia. Temperature increased during the first two hours \n\nand a half and its temperature increase rate increased with time since temperature difference \n\nbetween product in the center and in the periphery become bigger. At six hours experimental \n\nvalues show that practically all the system was in equilibrium. \n\nIn cycle 2 (Figure 4.11) the behavior of product temperatures was similar near the wall and in \n\nthe center. As time heating the cylinder was bigger and temperature difference between \n\nproduct and wall was smaller than in cycle 1, the effect of thermal inertia was smaller. \n\nCycle \n\n              \n (\u00b0C) \n\nTA TB TC TD \n\n1 0.98 1.61 0.87 1.39 \n\n2 0.94 0.88 1.11 1.13 \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n \n\n4.2. Frost formation \n\nDifferent phenomena are involved during frost formation. Completely frozen products consist \n\nof ice and liquid water (bounded water) with high concentration of solved solid. Air and \n\nproduct temperatures may change when submitted to external air cycles. If vapor \n\nconcentration of the surrounding air is lower than saturated vapor concentration at product \n\nsurface, ice may sublimate and water vapor is transferred to the air. In that case, the latent \n\nheat needed to sublimate water was provided by the product itself. After that, water vapor was \n\ntransferred to the air by diffusion and free convection. Humid air may undergo condensation \n\nby reaching cold surfaces (temperature lower than the air dew point), causing frost formation \n\nto start around the product surfaces. At the beginning of the process, when the product surface \n\nis frost free, nucleation phenomena occur, giving place to the subsequent crystal growth. That \n\nice crystal deposition increases cycle by cycle. \n\nPhenomena involved can be classified in periodic, like the ones induced by temperature \n\ncycles, or non-periodic, as nucleation that occurs at the beginning of the frost formation \n\nprocess. As soon as the nucleuses are formed, water vapor condensates and increases the ice \n\ncrystal size. Product dehydration is another important non-periodic phenomenon caused by \n\naccumulative product water sublimation along cycle repetition. Water vapor from the \n\nsublimation front diffuses through this layer, up to the surface. Mass transfer resistance \n\nincreases with time, reducing the frost formation rate. \n\n4.2.1. Experimental results \n\nFigure 4.12 shows experimental results of the cumulative frost formation into the container \n\nduring two months, for cycle 1 and 2.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 - Experimental values of cumulative frost formation for cycles 1 and 2, \n\nexperiment 1. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n \n\nThe rate of frost formation along the experiment elapsed time was constant, meaning that the \n\nperiodic phenomena have more impact in frost formation than non-periodic ones. The \n\nexperimental values could be approximated by a linear correlation, and its slope gave the rate \n\nof frost formation. Values for frost formation rates were of the same order of magnitude for \n\nboth cycles, as their driving forces were of the same order of magnitude, given by \n\n                                      for cycle 1 and              \n\n     18\u00b0               for cycle 2. \n\nFrost measurements were repeated using four cylinders for cycle 1 and two for cycle 2. Table \n\n4.6 \n\nTable 4.6 displays the correspondent rate of frost formation, together with their determination \n\ncoefficient (  ).  \n\nTable 4.6 - Frost formation rate for experiment repetitions \n\nExperiment Cylinder FF (g)/week R\u00b2 \n\nCycle 1 \n\n1 4,7142 0,9986 \n\n2 4,1628 0,9606 \n\n3 4,3815 0,9454 \n\n4 5,4171 0,9935 \n\nCycle 2 \n1 4,6605 0,9852 \n\n2 3,5567 0,9975 \n\n \n\nThe variability of the measurements was less than 24%, so it was concluded that despite of the \n\nlittle precision of the experimental measurement, the results could be used to have an order of \n\nmagnitude of the frost formation rate. \n\n4.2.2. Simulation results \n\nCylinder behavior was simulated and results are displayed in the next two figures, based on a \n\nradial plane, with the symmetry axis on the left hand side and the exterior wall on the right \n\nhand side. \n\nFigure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 bring product temperature distribution (a) and frost formed (b), \n\nwith superposed air velocity field, after 1 hour and 2 hours time simulation, respectively, for \n\ncycle 1.

Time 2 hours. \n\nDuring the first hour the container was heated from the exterior. As can be seen from product \n\ntemperature distribution (Figure 4.13.a), heat transfer into the container was dominated by \n\nconduction, and convection was neglected (temperature depends mainly on radial position). \n\nInterior air near the wall increases its temperature and a natural airflow was generated. This \n\nair moves up near the wall and down in the center of the container, where its temperature \n\ndecrease because of the contact with cold product (Figure 4.15.a). Air velocity was of the \n\norder of          (maximal value:           ). As air and product temperatures increase, \n\nair relative humidity decreases and mass transfer potential (sublimation) increases. Air moved \n\nup parallel to the wall transporting the vapor. When the air reached a cold region, in which \n\nproduct temperature was lower than the air dew point, vapor in the air condensate over \n\nproduct surface. In Figure 4.13.b it can be seen that the biggest rate of frost formation was in \n\nthe top, separated from the wall, but not in the center of the container, because most vapor \n\ncondensate before arriving to the center of the container. The maximum frost formation rate \n\nfor this instant was                  . \n\nAfter 2 hours the cylinder had been into the freezer at        for one hour and the container \n\nwas cooled from the wall. The temperature near the wall was decreasing, but due to porous \n\nmedia thermal inertia, there was a hotter region between the wall and the center of the \n\ncontainer (Figure 4.14.a).  For this reason appears two air circulations which moves down \n\nnear the wall and in the center of the container, and moves up in the hotter region (Figure \n\n4.15.b). The order of magnitude of the air velocity was ten times smaller than after 1 hour \n\n(maximal value:           ). In this regime, water from the product in the hotter region \n\nsublimates, and then condensate mainly near the wall which was the coldest region in the \n\ncontainer (Figure 4.14.b). For this time, the maximum frost formation rate was       \n\n            , lower but of the same order of magnitude than after 1 hour. Figure 4.16.a \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n \n \n\nshows the frost concentration           into the container after one day (86400 seconds) of \n\ncycle 1. As can be see the biggest concentration was in the wall surface. In Figure 4.16.b the \n\nregion next to the wall was suppress to have better resolution in the center of the domain, and \n\nit can be observed that in the top but separate from the wall there is another high \n\nconcentration region as was explained before. \n\n \n\na.       b. \n\nFigure 4.16 - Frost concentration           after one day (86400 s) of cycle 1. \n\nFigure 4.17 shows the cumulative frost formation during one day of cycle 1. The rate of frost \n\nformation can be separated in two stages with completely different values. During the first \n\nhour and a half, there was a high rate (         ) because of the big change in exterior \n\ntemperature. Then frost continued increasing but with a decreasing rate. After about 10 hours, \n\nwhen achieved a regime and the rate became constant (           ). Frost continued \n\nincreasing successively due to the low fluctuation into the freezer at      . The rate of frost \n\nformation depends on temperature fluctuation and even though temperature fluctuations are \n\nsmall (      this could be an important problem in the storage of frozen product during long \n\nperiods of time. From these values, and assuming that during the weekend the small constant \n\nrate applies, total frost formed in one week was            . This was smaller than the \n\nexperimental value,             (mean value of 4 repetitions), but of the same order of \n\nmagnitude. The same occurs for cycle 2, total frost formed from simulation was        \n\n    , which was smaller than the experimental value,             (mean value of 2 \n\nrepetitions). \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 - Simulated cumulative frost formation during one day, for cycle 1. \n\nFigure 4.18 presents the averages percentages of frost measured experimentally in each region \n\nfor cycle 1. The results were 20% in region A, 23% in region B, 27% in region C and 30% in \n\nregion D. Regions in the top had 7% more frost than the ones in the bottom and regions in the \n\nperiphery, near the wall, had 3% more frost than regions in the center. So most frost was \n\nformed in region D and the lowest was in region A. This result agrees with simulation results \n\n(Figure 4.16). The regions near the wall had more frost, but the volume is smaller, so total \n\nfrost near the wall (regions B and D) was smaller than in region in the top and centered \n\n(region A). Another detail to take into account is that when the product nets were removed to \n\nmeasure frost, the frost layer next the container wall was detached and it was not quantified. \n\nThe model predicted properly the more susceptible zones to frost formation into the container. \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 -Percentage of frost measure experimentally in each region. \n\n4.3. Parametric assessment \n\nModel parametric assessment was performed by changing one by one some parameters value \n\nand comparing temperature evolution and frost formation for cycle 1. Selected parameters \n\nwere: permeability K, equivalent conductivity keq, convective heat transfer coefficient h \n\nbetween product and air into the container and effective mass diffusivity    , within a range \n\nfrom half to twice its reference value (Table 4.1).Results for product temperature at region are \n\npresented in Figure 4.19. \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 - Effect on product temperature at region A due to model parameter variation, for \n\nCycle 1. \n\nAs it can be seen in Figure 4.19, conductivity was the most sensitive parameter affecting \n\nsignificantly the predicted temperature evolution. This behavior was expected since \n\nconduction heat transfer was the most important phenomenon (temperature fields from Figure \n\n4.13 and Figure 4.14).Temperature rates were proportional to the equivalent conductivity. \n\nConvective heat transfer coefficient, permeability and mass diffusivity did not have any \n\nsignificant effect in temperature evolution.

As it was discussed before, this model assumes constant \n\neffective mass diffusivity and in the reference case the dispersion term was ignored. On the \n\nother side, the convective heat transfer coefficient, from which the convective mass transfer \n\ncoefficient was also deduced, was measured experimentally in one point into the container to \n\nhave an order of magnitude, and was assume to be uniform and constant for the model. In this \n\ncontext, it was reasonable to consider that these values could be twice the reference value. \n\nScenario 10 brought that condition and the obtained value was similar to the experimental \n\none. \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nA simpler model of heat and mass transfer for a porous media and in conditions of free \n\nconvection was developed. The model predicted product temperatures for different \n\ntemperature cycles with deviations smaller than 12% for cycle 1 and 8% for cycle 2 in respect \n\nto experimental measurements. The model was a good tool to identify more susceptible \n\nregions for frost formation into the container.

Some of the identified parameter could be adjusted to obtain better results in \n\nterms of frost formation (           ). \n\nThe importance of different parameters in the frost formation prediction was observed \n\nthrough a sensitivity study, which pointed out the role of the effective mass diffusivity and \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n \n\nBibliography \n\n[1] R.C.

The problem was study as a macroporous \n\nmedia compose by the product and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow was \n\nassumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model was developed in \n\nthe commercial software CFD COMSOL, and it was test imposing different exterior air \n\ntemperature fluctuations (boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were \n\ncompared, varying one by one: average temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation. \n\nAs general result it was observed that product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is \n\ndirectly associated with frost formation into the container. The bigger the product temperature \n\nvariation, the bigger the amount of frost formed. Frost formation increase with large \n\namplitude of oscillation, but decrease with higher frequencies and mean temperatures. \n\nParameters that characterized the porous media were measure and identified for two \n\nporous media: slices of frozen carrots- air, and frozen green beans- air. Parameters can be \n\nclassified in three types: the ones that depend only on thermophysical properties (product \n\ndensity and apparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry (porosity, specific \n\nsurface and permeability) and the ones which depends on both (equivalent conductivity and \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient). From the results, summarized in Table 3.5, it can be seen \n\nthat parameters in the first case, were similar for both vegetables since they were compose \n\nmainly by water (carrots 87.79% and green beans 90.27%). Green beans density is 2% smaller \n\nthan carrot density. Pure geometric parameters were of the same order of magnitude for both \n\nporous media, but were a bit bigger for green beans than for carrots. It was not strange since \n\nproduct geometries were completely different. Green beans porosity was 18% bigger, specific \n\nsurface was 33% bigger and permeability was 14% bigger, respect to carrots. These results \n\nappear to be in concordance, since the biggest the porosity, the biggest the permeability. In \n\ncase of the last two parameters, equivalent conductivity and convective heat transfer \n\ncoefficient, the results were of the same order of magnitude. However, the equivalent \n\nconductivity varied more significantly, since it is directly related with the geometric \n\nappearance. As the porosity is smaller for carrots, there were more vegetables per bed volume, \n\nleading to a higher conductivity, and less air with lower conductivity. That situation explained \n\nthe equivalent conductivity augmentation on 28.5% In the case of convective coefficient, \n\ndifferences in geometric characteristics appear not to have a large impact. Fluid (air) and solid \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n \n\nphases in porous media have similar thermal properties, and finally the convective \n\ncoefficients were practically the same (7% higher for carrots bed). In general, parameters \n\nwhich characterize these porous media were similar for both products, even though the \n\ndifferent geometries.   \n\nA simpler model of heat and mass transfer for a porous media and in conditions of free \n\nconvection was developed. The model predicted product temperatures for different \n\ntemperature cycles with deviations smaller than 12% for cycle 1 and 8% for cycle 2 in respect \n\nto experimental measurements. The model was a good tool to identify more susceptible \n\nregions for frost formation into the container. The rate of frost formation from the model \n\n(           ) was lower than in the experiment (          ), but the order of magnitude \n\nwas correct. Some of the identified parameter could be adjusted to obtain better results in \n\nterms of frost formation (           ). \n\nThe importance of different parameters in the frost formation prediction was observed \n\nthrough a sensitivity study, which pointed out the role of the effective mass diffusivity and \n\nconvective heat transfer coefficient.  \n\n \n\n5.1 General conclusion and perspectives \n\nA model was developed to predict frost formation during the storage of a bulk of \n\nfrozen vegetables. This model is a first step of the project Flexifroid, in order to create a tool \n\nfor the industry to predict frost formation during normal storage conditions, or in cases of \n\ndisconnection from the energy supply.  \n\nThis work would continue in different ways, in direction to a macroscopic study, \n\nimproving the model and introducing it into a model of the air flow and heat exchange in the \n\ncold room, or microscopic study, analyzing recrystallization and frost densification. \n\nSome possible lines of work are summarized below: \n\n- Improve the model to consider recrystallization phenomena and frost densification. \n\n- Made a micro tomography in a small scale sample of the porous media, in order to \n\nunderstand the phenomena involved during the frost formation. \n\n- Validate the model changing to a cubic container (3D model) with real dimensions. \n\n- Implement a reduced model. \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \n \n\n- Model air flow and heat transfer into the cold room with a stack of pallets in the real \n\narrangement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n \n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\nAmara, S.B.
