Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nThe current work gathers three scientific papers on the Fortaleza de Minas Ni-Cu \n\nmassive sulfide deposit already available for issueing in international magazines and prepared \n\nfor submission as a PhD thesis. The thesis is part of the Regional Geology Post-Graduation \n\nProgram linked to the Geology  Course from the Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias Exatas of \n\nthe State University of S\u00e3o Paulo - Rio Claro Campus. \n\nLocated four kilometers to the South of the small Fortaleza de Minas village, in the \n\nSW of Minas Gerais State, the Fortaleza de Minas deposit, hosted by komatiitic flows, was \n\ndiscovered in 1983, through follow up diamond drilling to test Ni-Cu-Co and PGE soil \n\nanomalies associated to outcroping gossans in the Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt. Further \n\nprospective geophysical works and massive diamond drilling campaignsoutlined at depth a \n\nmassive sulfide orebody with average width of 4 meters, more than 1,500m long and \n\nachieving depths higher than 500m. \n\nThe huge dataset of geological information generated since the deposit discovery until \n\nnow, including important information from both openpit and underground mining and \n\nprocessing, had always the author`s participation, who, during all this period, acted as the \n\nresident mine geologist. \n\nAll this information is now gathered by the author, in order to discuss the deposit \n\ng\u00eanesis during Archean times, and its later evolution, to make it available to the literature in \n\nthe form of three major articles. \n\nThe first \u201cThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore \n\ntypes distribution and genesis\u201d presents the deposit ore types, their mineralogy, chemitry \n\nand distribution throughout the deposit. The different ore types are described including well \n\npreserved Archean primary types and tectonically remobilised types during paleoproterozoic \n\nand neoproterozoic events. A new hidrothermal ore type is also described which was formed \n\nduring the last reactivation in the Neoproterozoic associated with Ni and PGE enrichment. \n\nThe weathering profile of the deposit is also described with its typical gossan zone. The \n\ndistribution of the different ore types, their genesis and evolution are also discussed. \n\n\n\nTHE FORTALEZA DE MINAS NICKEL, COPPER AND PLATINOIDS DEPOSIT: ORE TYPES, TECTONICS AND VOLCANOLOGICAL ASPECTS 2 \n\n \n\nThe second \u201cTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) \n\nFortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brasil\u201d describes the resulting ore types after \n\nsucessive deformations. The geotectonic environment of the deposit and the tectono-\n\nmetamorfic events which affected the mineralisation are discussed. The deposit and ore types \n\nstructural geology is presented in its macro and micro aspects. The tectono-metamorfic \n\nevolution of the deposit towards its current configuration is discussed. Colisional and \n\ntranscurrent processes affected the deposit geometry and its ore types, but their primary \n\nzoning is still preserved. \n\nThe third \u201cThe Fortaleza de Minas Nickel Sulfide Deposit: An Example of \n\nKomatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows\u201d describes \n\nthe mineralogical and petrochemical aspects and volcanologic faciology of the komatiitic host \n\nflow and other neighbor flows. A genetic model for the deposit is discussed and shows that \n\nFortaleza de Minas is an uncommon example of volcanogenic nickel deposit developed on a \n\nlava lake facies contrasting with the majority of komatiitic deposits, which are formed \n\npreferably on channel facies. Isotopic data show indications of crustal assimilation reinforcing \n\nits distal environment. Its chemistry and fractioning pattern are compared to other similar \n\nflows. The unique chemical signature of the deposit is highlighted with implications to \n\nexploratory models. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de \n\nMinas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nT.

The different ore types observed in the deposit and its distribution \n\nrevealed the original volcanic setting for the ore formation and also the geological evolution \n\nand transformation of the different ore types. The nickel mineralization is classified as a Type \n\n1 deposit (Lesher and Keays, 2002). It is associated to an open trough structure of lava \n\npathway. Later metamorphism and deformation obliterated most of the original volcanic \n\ntextures and promoted a strong stretching of the ore zone and remobilization of the massive \n\nbreccia ore along a major shear zone installed at the base of an upper fractionated host flow \n\nunit in contact with a footwall BIF. In the upper proterozoic Brasiliano Cycle (0.6 Ga) a new \n\nore type was formed of hydrothermal origin with extremely high nickel grades and PGE \n\nnuggests. \n\nIntroduction \n\nHaving completed 20 years of continuous exploratory and infill drilling in the Fortaleza de \n\nMinas Ni - Fe sulfide deposit (Brenner et al. 1990), aided by the opening of both open pit and \n\nunderground mines since 1998, a better understanding of the geological framework of its \n\nvolcanic environment can now be achieved. Within this period several academical studies \n\nwere carried out with under-graduated and graduated students from the University of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo State \u2013 UNESP at Rio Claro Campus (Santos, 1996; Santos et al., 1997; Carvalho, \n\n1998; Carvalho et al., 1999). Detailed mapping and sampling in both mines in addition to core \n\nlogging allowed the understanding of the geometry of the mineralized flow revealing troughs \n\nwithin a broader embayment structure similar to other Type 1 deposits related to komatiiites \n\n(Lesher and Keays, 2002).  The primary ore types typical of Type 1 deposits \u2013 disseminated, \n\nmatrix and massive \u2013 were strongly affected by late metamorphism and shearing giving origin \n\nto other ore types and squeezed the sulfides away from the original trough environment along \n\nthe olivine-cumulate host and footwall BIF contact. Strong squeezing associated to \n\ntranscurrent shear displacement and the remobilization of the primary ore types masked the \n\nidentification of the original trough structures. However, detailed mapping of the ore type \n\ndistributions and modeling of footwall BIF thinning interpreted as an indication of \n\nmechanical-thermal erosion, led to the tentative identification of possible lava pathways in the \n\ndeposit.  \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          4 \n\nGeological setting \n\nThe geology of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area was described in Marchetto et al. (1984), \n\nTeixeira et al (1987) and Brenner et al (1990) and has been reviewed more recently with new \n\nstudies (Zanardo et al, 1996; Zanardo, 1992; Zanardo, 1990 and Morales, 1993). The area is \n\ncomprised by an archean crustal nuclei of granite-greenstone terrain within a broad nappe \n\nstructure of proterozoic meta-sediments named as Passos Nappe. This block was once part of \n\nthe Archean Paramirim Craton which was reworked during the Proterozic into the Arax\u00e1 \n\nmobile belt. The Fortaleza de Minas Ni\u2013Fe sulfide deposit is locate in the SW side of the \n\nnorthern portion of the Guariroba-Peroba segment (Fig. 1), considered to represent the basal \n\npart of the Morro do Ferro greenstone belt (Teixeira and Danni, 1979a,b). The upper portion \n\nbeing represented by the thick chemical-detritical sediments in the northeastern side of the \n\nPeroba area to the South. Sm/Nd isotopic results from the Ni deposit host flow revealed an \n\nage of ca. 2.86 Ga for the cristalization of the lavas (Pimentel &amp; Ferreira Filho, 2002), \n\nsuggesting that these rocks are coeval to the Piumhi greenstone belt (ca. 2.9\u20133.1 Ga). The area \n\nwas esposed to regional metamorphism during the paleoproterozoic Transamazonian Orogeny \n\n(2.16\u20132.0 Ga), achieving high amphibolite facies in the deposit area, whith temperatures \n\nhigher than 650 oC (Fernandes, 1998). The region was later affected by intense transcurrent \n\nshearing during the Brasiliano Cycle (900\u2013520 Ma) with reactivation of major regional faults \n\nassociated with retrograde metamorphism with temperature not higher than 300oC. \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt geology and deposits. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          5 \n\nGeology of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area \n\nBrenner et al (1990) identified four cicles or flow units in the deposit area of serpentinite- \n\nclino-pyroxenite- gabbro separated by banded iron formations. The nickel deposit occur in the \n\nuppermost flow unit (Fig. 2). The flow units were named \u2018intermediate sequence` having a \n\nlower and an upper sequences represented by komatiitic basalt flows and subordinately \n\nkomatiite flows and graphitic meta-cherts and tuffs (black shales). The upper and lower \n\nsequences represent the dominant units in the Guariroba-Peroba area. The intermediate \n\nsequence is currently interpreted as a thick highly fractionated flow (Hill et al., 1995; Hill, \n\n2001), where the individual cycles represent individual flow units separated by thin BIF. The \n\nvolcanic environment of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is interpreted as of a Ponded facies in \n\na distal shallow lava lake (Brenner and Carvalho, 2006). \n\n \n\nFig. 2. Geological map of the Fortaleza de Minas Ni \u2013 Fe sulfide deposit. Pale grey color representing \nthe upper and lower sequences from Brenner et al, 1990 and the intermediate sequence interpreted herein \nas a thick highly fractioned flow. The orebody is extremely elongated by shearing along a transcurrent \nsinistral shear zone. Southwestern limb of syncline displays marginal mineralization at depth. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          6 \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Ni \u2013 Fe sulfide mineralization \n\nThe Ni, Cu, Co, PGE deposit (Brenner et al, 1990) has a 1.5 km strike length and an average \n\nwidth of 5 meters. Reserves are indicated to a 500m depth below surface. The Ni \u2013 Fe sulfide \n\nmineralization occur along a sinistral shear zone installed at the base of a mineralized olivine-\n\ncumulate in contact with a footwall BIF (Fig. 3). The typical hanging wall is represented \n\ncurrently by a massive serpentinite or a talc \u2013 carbonate schist both metamorphic products \n\nformed after an olivine-cumulate basal zone from a fractionated komatiitic flow. The most \n\ncommon footwall is a banded iron formation although it can be locally represented by talc-\n\ncarbonate schist, pyroxene-cumulates or sepentinite. The deposit displayed a global resource \n\nof the order of 6 Mt with an average grade of 2.5% Ni, 0.40 % Cu, 500 ppm Co and 0.7 g/t Pt, \n\nPd, Au. The current underground mine has still one year of mine life after the start up in 1998. \n\nMajor ore types  \n\nThree major ore types have been defined in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit (Brenner et al, \n\n1990), from top to base, as follows: Disseminated ore (DS), Matrix ore (MX) and Breccia ore \n\n(BR) (Fig. 3). Other remobilized ore types has also been identifyied and include Sheared ore \n\n(SU), BIF hosted ore (SC) and a late hydrothermal massive sulfide (HMS). \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Schematic stratrigraphic column of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit and ore types distribution \nprofiles. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          7 \n\nFrom the different ore types the disseminated and matrix are considered to be primary \n\nmagmatic ore types with variable degree of deformation but still preserving magmatic \n\ntextures under superimposed cataclastic textures. The Breccia ore is fully recristalized with \n\nindications of polyphasic evolution from ductile to brittle regime. It is interpreted as derived \n\nafter originally magmatic massive sulfides and, partially, after reworked matrix ore in \n\nintensely sheared zones. The distribution of breccia, matrix and disseminated ore follows the \n\nmodel proposed by Naldrett (1973) named as billiard ball model (Fig. 4). \n\n \n\nFig. 4.

The mean compositon is based in a detailed sampling program \n\nand petrographic work carried out in the open pit mine.

It is hosted by serpentinites and its defined by a 0.60% \n\nNi natural cut-off. It has in average 15 to 25 wt% total sulphides with the following \n\nproportion: 65% pirrhotite, 30% pentlandite, 5% chalcopyrite (Table 1). It has an average \n\ngrade of about 1% Ni and at depth, in the lower portions of the underground mine, it averages \n\n0.8% Ni. Like the serpentinite host it shows a magnetite content of 15 wt%. The sulfides are \n\nfinelly grained and normally well disseminated through the serpentinite. In the hanging wall \n\ncontact, transitional at a small scale, the sulphides start to concentrate into clouds or small \n\nnucleus but rapidly they tend to evolve into a well distributed dissemination. Tipical grades \n\nare: 0.95% Ni, 0.25% Cu, 260 ppm Co, 2.70% S, 0.13 g/t Pt, 0.24 g/t Pd, 0.08 g/t Au. It \n\ngradually but rapidly increase the sulfide content downwards to the matrix ore (Fig. 5a, 5b \n\nand 5c). \n\n \nMatrix ore (MX) \n \n\nThe transition from disseminated ore to matrix ore is marked by the 2.00% Ni natural cut-off. \n\nBecause of the intense shearing observed in the mine area most of the contacts observed \n\nbetween the disseminated and matrix ores are tectonic marked by a thin talcose fine grain \n\nmylonitic zone. Sometimes tectonic wedges or slabs of disseminated and matrix ore types can \n\nbe intercalated. However, in many places, in both open pit and underground mine, a clear \n\ntransition between the two ore types were mapped and sampled. The average sulfide content \n\nis 50 wt% with similar proportion as for the disseminated ore: 65% pirrhotite, 30% \n\npentlandite, 5% chalcopyrite, and also same amount of magnetite (16 wt%). The average \n\ngrade for the matrix ore is about 3.00 to 3.50% Ni. In the transitional contact zone the \n\ndisseminated ore increases the grade to 1.60 and 1.80% Ni and gradually assumes the typical \n\nmatrix ore texture achieving grades of 2.2 to 2.5% Ni and higher (Figs. 5b and 5c). The matrix \n\nore has a distinctive fabric similar to many other net-textured ore from volcanogenic massive \n\nsulfide deposits (Lesher, 1989; Lesher and Keays, 2002). Rounded shaped serpentine \n\nmagnetite gangue is involved by a sulfide network. The rounded masses of serpentine + \n\nmagnetite are interpreted as metamorphosed cumulate olivine crystals surrounded by sulfide \n\n(Fig. 5d). This texture is interpreted as a primary magmatic texture. The matrix is a very \n\nisotropic and uniform ore type (Fig. 5e e g). Under the microscope and in hand specimen the \n\nmatrix ore usually displays a cataclastic texture but still preserving its primary texture (Figs. \n\n5d and 5f). Variations in grain size may occur ranging from a fine to coarse texture. In some \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          9 \n\nplaces an alternation of finer and coarser ore were interpreted as primary flow layering \n\nstructures. The matrix ore typical grade composition is: 3.40% Ni, 0.63% Cu, 724 ppm Co, \n\n13.2% S, 0.53 g/t Pt, 0.74 g/t Pd, 0.14 g/t Au. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5. Fortaleza de Minas ore types DS/MX.

It is commonly well recrystalized (Fig. \n\n6a) but can also be intensely sheared due to continuos processes of shearing and \n\nrecrystalization under a transcurrent ductile-brittle regime. Its typical emplacement is \n\nat the hanging wall serpentinite and footwall BIF contact, usually extending beyond \n\nthe primary embayment limits (Fig. 6b). It shows a gradational decay in both grade \n\nand amount of sulfide from the center to the lateral extensions of the deposit. When \n\nsheared it displays rounded and elongated fragments of wall rocks and occasionally \n\nsegregation of pentlandite in layers along the foliation plane (Fig. 6c). \n\nThe Breccia ore (BR) has been subdivided into BR1 and BR2 sub-types reflecting the \n\nremobilization process under transcurrent shear regime. The BR1 has higher Ni grade and \n\noccur in the central embayment structure, typically and commonly below the matrix and \n\ndisseminated ores. An exception is the immediate North extension from the embayment \n\nzone where very high grade recrystalized BR occurs remobilized into the footwall BIF. \n\nBR1 has a clean recristalised groundmass where clasts of both serpentinite (fig. 6d) \n\nand BIF (Figs. 6e and 6f) are common. Minor fragments of talc schist may also occur. \n\nThe fragments are usually rounded and slightly flattened but angular fragments are \n\nalso common. They vary in size from milimetric to decimetric but can achieve metric \n\nsizes eventually. In some places fragments of disseminated ore and also matrix ore can \n\nbe found in the breccia ore (Fig. 6c). At the footwall contact BIF fragments are more \n\ncommon and exposures in the open pit mine revealed a continuous process of \n\nfragmentation and incorporation of the footwall BIF into the brecciated massive \n\nsulfide along the sheared contact and fault offsets (Fig. 6g). The BR2 shows a dirty \n\ntalcose sulfide matrix with consequently average lower Ni grades than the BR1 sub-\n\ntype. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          11 \n\n \n\nFig. 6.

Fragments are \n\ndominantly talc schist and BIF (Fig. 7b). Talc fragments are extremely flattened and in \n\ngeneral the majority of the fragments are well oriented and of smaller size when compared to \n\nthe BR1 ore sub-type. They BR2 typically occur at the lateral extentions of the embayment \n\nzone where the ore shows a consistent reduction in both width and grades. At the limits of the \n\neconomic central shoots the BR2 gradually merge into the Sheared ore (SU) where the \n\ncataclastic texture typical of the BR2 ore remains quite unchanged but the total amount of \n\nsulfides drops considerably into the sheared low grade talcose ore SU (Fig. 7c). The breccia \n\nore typical grade composition is: 4.14% Ni, 0.56% Cu, 870 ppm Co, 16.0% S, 0.42 g/t Pt, \n\n0.69 g/t Pd, 0.14 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 65 wt% (BR1) and 62 wt% (BR2) with \n\nproportions of 65% pirrhotite, 25% pentlandite, 10% chalcopyrite, and the amount of \n\nmagnetite (10 \u2013 12 wt%) is also similar to the disseminated and matrix ore types. \n\n \nSheared ore (SU) \n \n\nThis ore type occurs outside of the trough zones where the disseminated and matrix ores are \n\ndominant. The sheared ore displays a flaser mylonitic fabric (Fig. 7c), and although \n\ndisplaying low grades similarly to the disseminated ore, it shows a clear relationship and \n\ngradation to the also sheared breccia ore (BR2 sub-type). Talc is the typical gangue mineral, \n\nand smaller amounts of carbonate, chlorite and magnetite are met with. The sulfides are \n\ninterconnected as anastomosed veinlets with typical triangular cuspade junctions. Because of \n\nthis interconnected mylonitic fabric this ore type behaves as massive sulfide in response to \n\nground EM surveys. The distribution of this ore type is widespread troughout the external \n\nzones of the deposit extending hundreds of meters from the primary central embayment zone. \n\nIt is positioned at the base of the hanging wall serpentinite or talc schist but sometimes it \n\nmakes contact with pyroxenites when the serpentinite is pinched out by shearing. It may occur \n\nalone or intermixed with the BR2 ore and may also occur associated with the BIF hosted ore, \n\nsometimes tectonically intercalated. Based in it\u2019s distribution and relationship to the BR2 ore \n\nit has been interpreted as a tectonically remobilized ore type derived after the BR2 ore \n\noriginated by intense shearing with continuous decay in sulfide content from the massive \n\nsulfide ore and being squeezed along the talcose contact shear zone. In the outer limits of the \n\ndeposit this ore type can be very persistent occurring as a continuous centimetric sheared \n\ntalcose zone which can be traced by drilling hundreds of meters away from the mineable part \n\nof the deposit. The typical grades for the sheared ore are: 1.23% Ni, 0.22% Cu, 308 ppm Co, \n\n5.1% S, 0.23 g/t Pt, 0.32 g/t Pd, 0.09 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 22 wt% with \n\nproportions of 65Po:25Pn:10Cp with magnetite content of 14 wt%. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          13 \n\n \n\nFig. 7.

It is a remobilized ore type formed during transcurrent shearing \n\npolyphasic events. Ni sulfides in the BIF occur as massive or breccia sulfide veins, veinlets, \n\nstringers, tension gashes fillings or as disseminated banded sulfides (Figs. 7d, e, f, g). Most of \n\nthe time, Ni sulfide stringers and veinlets invade a silicate facies baren BIF achieving \n\neconomic grades. In places, banded exalative baren sulfides (Po) were locally replaced by Ni \n\nbearing sulfides along the original bedding (Fig. 7f). In the trough zones the SC ore is \n\nnormally absent or rare. The footwall BIF is also absent or rare and thin in the trough zones. \n\nThe absence or thinning of the BIF has been interpreted as result of thermal erosion of the \n\nthick BIF unit. In the North of the central embayment there is a gradation between breccia ore \n\n(BR1) and the BIF hosted ore. Bench exposures in the north of the open pit revealed a front of \n\nwell recrystalised breccia ore being tectonically translocated into the footwall BIF along \n\nfractures and faults parallel to the foliation and bedding and breaking and absorbing BIF \n\nfragments. A continuous process of breccia ore veining along foliation with subsequent \n\nmerging of the BR1 veins into a single massive sulfide body with fragments of the BIF walls \n\ncan be observed in this area where the breccia ore occurs surrounded by a halo of BIF hosted \n\nore (Figs 7d, e, g). The BIF hosted ore type is usually well recristalized with good liberation \n\nat the mill (Fig. 7h). In the underground mine, in highly folded areas in the footwall, massive \n\nsulfide offset veins can be squeezed into the footwall BIF along faults and fold nucleus (Fig. \n\n7i). The typical grades for the BIF hosted ore are: 1.00% Ni, 0.35% Cu, 239 ppm Co, 4.4% S, \n\n0.11 g/t Pt, 0.20 g/t Pd, 0.08 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 28 wt% with proportions \n\nof 65Po:25Pn:10Cp similar to the  sheared ore. Magnetite is rare in the SC ore type, but \n\nlocally can exceed 15 wt%. \n\n \n\nHydrothermal massive sulphide (HMS) \n \n\nWith the opening of the open pit mine a new ore type was identified with remarkably \n\ndifferences from the previous ore types. A high grade massive sulfide with characteristic \n\ncoarse pentlandite crystals was mapped in steep oblique hanging wall faults and fractures in \n\nthe southern portion of the open pit. This ore type displays a post-tectonic fabric with lack of \n\nmetamorphic foliation although can be locally sheared. It occurs as typical fault plane or \n\nfracture infills in the immediate hanging wall of the ore zone (Fig. 8). It shows a clear \n\nrelationship to the breccia ore (BR) from which it seems to be derived. It normally shows a \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          15 \n\nfaulted contact to the BR including tectonic slabs of other ore types and host rocks like \n\nserpentinite and BIF. As it moves away into the hanging wall it looses gradually thickness \n\nacting a typical vein until it pinches out a few meters to tens of meters from the main ore \n\nzone. In some cases it can be split into smaller veinlets along vertical to horizontal fractures in \n\na stockwork array. With continuous mapping and underground mine development this ore \n\ntype proved to be persistent although intermittent towards the deeper portions of the deposit \n\ndisplaying sub-vertical plunges but moving south as it goes deeper as a broad en echelon \n\nstructure.  \n\n \n\nFig. 8. Open pit 990 bench horizontal plan showing four offset bodies of HMS ore associated to \noblique faults in the hanging wall olivine cumulate (serpentinite). \n\n \n\n \n\nContrasting to the other ore types the HMS can display zoning structures in the contact with \n\nwall rocks with different phases of Pn rich ore bordered by a massive Cp zone and with a \n\nmassive magnetite contact halo. Talc, carbonate and chalcopyrite hydrothermal breccias are \n\ncommonly associated with the HMS (Fig. 9a). This ore type show a very high nickel grade (8-\n\n14%Ni) when compared to the BR ore which usually displays grades between 3 and 5% Ni. It \n\ncan exceed 90% wt% sulfides. It also shows an abnormal concentration of PGM achieving \n\nvalues of 5 g/t Pt and up to 40 g/t Pd. The Pn crystals are remarkably large where \n\npoikiloblastic decimetric crystals were recorded (Fig. 9b, c). The HMS ore shows a \n\ngreenschist facies paragenesis and also uncommon minor element association for this type of \n\ndeposit such as Ag, Mo, Bi. The typical grades for the HMS ore are: 9.10% Ni, 0.71% Cu, \n\n1650 ppm Co, 28.3% S, 0.35 g/t Pt, 4.44 g/t Pd. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          16 \n\n \n\nFig. 9.

The transition zone is herein defined on the \n\nbasis of 25% of violarite concentration resulting from primary pentlandite substitution (Fig. \n\n9d). A typical exposure of the transition zone is shown in figure 9e (1000N bench), which is \n\nrepresented by stained violarite zone developed on breccia ore. The gossan zone occurs on top \n\nof the transition zone. Figure 9f shows a hand sample from the gossan zone with distinctive \n\nsub-horizontal hard massive limonite vein, which represents reprecipitation of iron along sub-\n\nhorizontal dilation fractures that cuts the friable gossan and weathered host walls. In the \n\nweathering process these hard iron oxide forms a typical gossan stone line over the deposit \n\narea which is responsible for a broad widespread Ni-Cu soil geochemical anomaly. The \n\ncontact between the gossan and the sulfides (violarite zone) is quite irregular and often \n\ngradational with rounded blocks of matrix ore preserved within the gossan groundmass (Figs. \n\n9g and 3). The weathered zone longitudinal profile shows a more uniform distribution for the \n\ngossan cap, which follows the topographic surface (fig. 10). The transition zone forms a more \n\nirregular boundary due to a more complex control depending on ore type and structures \n\n(faults, fractures). Continuous mapping and sampling of the gossan zone during the open pit \n\nmine stripping revealed a vertical and horizontal transition in metal grades. In the massive \n\nbreccia ore the grade can drop from 4-6% Ni in the fresh ore to 0.5% Ni in the gossan.  \n\n \n\nFig. 10. Longitudinal weathering profile showing the oxidized gossan zone (30m) followed by the \ntransition zone (Pyrite - violarite) (20m). The lower limit of the transition zone was initially defined \nafter downdip subvertical drilling and later confirmed by bench mapping and sampling in the open pit \nmine. The transition between fresh sulfides and the violarite zone was defined by the cut of 20% of \npentlandite converted to violarite on polished sections. Outcroping gossans in the northern area played \nan important role in the discovery of the deposit. An old river channel buried by lateritic soil was \nexposed in the pre-stripping of the open pit which caused locally almost complete erosion of the \ngossan zone. \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          18 \n\nThe different ore types also display different weathering profiles, where the amount of \n\nsulfides in the primary ore is directly related the depth of the gossan profile (Fig. 11). The \n\nsulfide mineralogy of the primary ore, basically pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite, is \n\nreplaced by pyrite-marcassite, violarite-bravoite and chalcopyrite-(covelite) in the transition \n\nzone, and finally, in the gossan zone, by goethite-pyrite. \n\n \n\nFig. 11. Schematic vertical cross-section through the gossan zone based on open pit mine bench \nmapping. The matrix ore is more resistant to weathering and display a typical onion shell structure \nwhere nuclei of resistant violaritic matrix ore remains preserved within the gossan. The Breccia ore is \nmore suitable for weathering and show a deeper gossan profile. The disseminated ore with only 15% \nsulfides does not develop a true gossan but shows instead a stained mottled rock. \n \n\nOre geochemistry  \n \nThe major economic elements of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit are displayed in tables 2, 3, \n\nand 4.  \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          19 \n\nTable 2.

The different ore types \n\nlayouts and their association give clues to the original distribution of the ore and also to it\u2019s \n\ngenetic model. There is a strong correlation between disseminated and matrix ore types and \n\nthey both occur within or close to the breccia sub-type (BR1). On the other hand the \n\ndisseminated and sheared ore rarely occur together. Sheared ore (SU) is associated with BIF \n\nhosted ore and to the breccia ore sub-type (BR2). The vertical longitudinal section (Fig. 14) \n\nshows a schematic distribution of the different ore types and grades in the deposit suggesting \n\ntrough structures where primary ore originally formed. There is a clear grade variation in the \n\nbreccia ore in respect to the occurrence of troughs as suggested by the presence of \n\ndisseminated and matrix ores. Figure 15 shows the nickel grade distribution along mapped \n\nand sampled sublevels from the underground mine. A clear drop in nickel grade is observed \n\nas the ore is remobilized from the trough zones until the breccia ore sub-type (BR2) gradually \n\nchanges into the sheared ore. \n\n \n \nFig. 14.

Thick \nline indicates presence of remobilized and sheared talc bearing ore (SU) indicating lateral thinning of  \nmineralization along shear zone outside the central embayment.

Sheared talc-bearing breccia ore (3) displays lower grades than (1) occurs laterally \nto troughs and gradually change into sheared low grade ore (SU) at orebody limits by continuous drop \nin sulfide content. A richer recristalized breccia ore (2) occurs at about 1900N local coordinate in a \nBIF tensile zone. Sublevel names 900L and 750L refer to true elevation above sea level. \n\nOre types evolution \n \nThe Fortaleza de Minas nickel sulfide mineralization was initially formed at the basal portion \n\nof a olivine-cumulate unit trapped in a lava channel or trough. The mineralization is similar to \n\nthe Lesher and Keays, 2002 Type 1 classification. Ore settled as a basal massive sulfide \n\nfollowed by matrix ore and disseminated ore in a olivine-cumulate host. Folding and regional \n\nmetamorphism, promoted recrystalization and remobilization of the ore destroying much of \n\nits primary texture. The gangue minerals in the ore reflect the host rock mineralogy with \n\nparagenesis compatible with the amphibolite facies for the major syn-tectonic metamorphic \n\nevent assumed to be of paleoproterozoic age (circa 2Ga). This age is supported by a Rb/Sr \n\nisocron obtained after amphiboles from the mine footwall BIF. At the closure of the \n\nTransamazonian Cycle the host olivine-cumulate and both disseminated and matrix ore were \n\ncompletely serpentinized. During the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano Cycle a system of \n\ntranscurrent faults affected the ore zone promoting stretching and shearing of the ore under \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          24 \n\nbrittle-ductile regime. Retrograde metamorphism affected the ore and wall rocks. High CO2 \n\nfluid pressure were responsible for partial transformation of serpentinites into talc-carbonate \n\nschist. Evidences of retrograde metamorphism associated with strong shearing are present in \n\nthe ore. Most of the talc observed in sheared ores is interpreted to have formed during the \n\nBrasiliano Cycle (900 \u2013 520 Ma), where the major shear zones where active under greenschist \n\nfacies metamorfic conditions achieving temperatures about 300oC. At this time probably the \n\nbreccia ore was remobilized along the serpentinite / BIF sheared contact forming the sheared \n\nbreccia ore sub-type (BR2), and finally into the low grade sheared ore towards the deposit \n\nlateral extensions. A new ore type was fully formed during the Brasiliano Cycle, the \n\nhydrothermal massive sulfide (HMS) associated with carbonate breccias along late oblique \n\nfaults that cuts the hanging wall. Due to field contact relationships it is assumed that the HMS \n\nore is derived after the breccia ore as a hydrothermal remobilization which achieved ore grade \n\nas high as 14% Ni with high PGE nuggets up to 40 g/t Pd. \n\n \n\nOrigin of the Breccia ore \n \n\nThe breccia ore is the most continuous and widespread ore type in the deposit. Its current \n\nfabric is unquestionably tectonic showing evidences of several phases of shearing and \n\nrecrystalization in both ductile and brittle regimes. However the high amount of wall-rock \n\nfragments and the dominance of footwall BIF fragments suggest that some of these fragments \n\nmay have been incorporated into the massive sulfide by thermal erosion processes. It is very \n\nclear that in the trough zone defined by the presence of thick breccia, matrix and disseminated \n\nores the footwall BIF is either absent or much thinner than normal. \n\nIt is reasonable to conclude that a considerable part of the footwall BIF in the embayment \n\nzone was taken by thermal erosion incorporating BIF fragments into the massive sulfide. \n\nLater tectonic events promoted more breciation at the interface between the brittle BIF and \n\nthe easily remobilized massive sulfide. In bench exposures in the northern side of the open pit \n\na thick \u201cvein\u201d of breccia ore was mapped as a shortcut into the footwall BIF leaving apart \n\nfrom the normal BIF / serpentinite contact zone. Smaller veins and stringers of massive \n\nsulfide where remobilized from the main breccia ore into fractures and faults breaking and \n\nincorporating new angular BIF fragments into the massive sulfide groundmass (Figs. 7e \u2013 7g). \n\nAlthough fully injected into the footwall BIF for more than 50 meters, until it comes back to \n\nthe normal BIF / serpentinite interface, the breccia ore also carried large fragments of matrix \n\nore, and smaller fragments of serpentinite and eventually talc schist among the dominant BIF \n\nfragments. It is considered that the wide extension of the breccia ore outside the embayment \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          25 \n\nzone is due to tectonic remobilization of sulfide along a contact shear zone under high \n\ntemperature and high CO2 fluid pressure. The breccia ore gradually changes to the breccia ore \n\nsub-type (BR2), with more talc schist fragments and less sulfides assuming a flaser mylonitic \n\nstructure. At the deposit limits this talc bearing ore gives place to the low grade sheared ore \n\nwith the same flaser mylonitic structure but with much lower grades until it becomes \n\nuneconomic (Fig. 15). Marginal  sheared ore has been identified by drilling as far as 600m \n\naway from the embayment zone along the major contact shear zone. \n\nSource of Sulfur \n \n\nThe footwall BIF can be quite thick outside the embayment zone. It displays a distinctive \n\nzoning from a thin oxide facies at the base (as the other lower BIFs) into a broad zone of \n\nsilicate facies BIF with alternating layers of silica, actinolite and cummingtonite/ grunerite \n\n(Fernandes et al., 1998a and 1998b; Fernandes et al., 2004). At the top, in the contact zone \n\nwith the ore it can display a discrete amount of exalative banded baren sulfide (Fig. 7f). \n\nHowever, the small amount of sulfides do not suport the footwall BIF as a sulfur supplier.  It \n\nis considered then that the source of sulfur would be placed far upstream in the lava channel. \n\nIn the southwestern limb of the syncline the footwall BIF oxide facies shows a lateral change \n\nto a graphite-bearing sulfide BIF. These graphite cherts or BIFs can display considerable \n\namount of baren sulfide, dominantly pyrrhotite with subordinate chalcopyrite and minor \n\nsphalerite. Most of the komatiite hosted Type 1 deposits show indications of local \n\ncontamination processes related to thermomechanical erosion of S-rich banded iron \n\nformations beneath lava channels (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Lesher and Arndt, 1995; \n\nBeresford, 2005; Naldrett, 2005). Indications of crustal contamination such as enrichment in \n\nlight rare-earth elements (Fig. 16) can be found in many komatiite lava flowing conduits by \n\nthermomechanical erosion and assimilarion of banded iron formations. Extensive sulfide/ \n\noxide bearing banded iron formations in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area are interpreted as \n\nthe major source for crustal contamination. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Komatiite-Hosted Ni\u2013Cu\u2013(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          26 \n\n \n\nFig. 16.

The deposit has been highly deformed, \n\nsheared and metamorphosed since the lower proterozoic developing other remobilized ore \n\ntypes but still preserving some of it\u2019s primary cumulate textures and embayment structures. \n\nDisseminated, matrix and breccia massive sulfide are the major primary ore types  similar to \n\nother Type 1 deposits. Average grades are 2.5%Ni, 0.4%Cu and 0.7g/t Pt,Pd,Au. It is a low \n\ntenor ore (9%Ni) with Ni:Cu ratio of 7.5 and S:Ni ratio of 3.85.

One NW-trending sigmoid at south of Fortaleza de Minas is a transtensive segment \n\nwhere the Ni-Co-Cu sulfide mine covered in this paper is located. The sigmoid inner structure \n\ninvolves several more discrete brittle-ductile shear zones of P, R, R\u2019 and Y types and T \n\nfractures, as well as younger strike-slip and normal brittle shear zones, all of which related to \n\nthe Campo do Meio System. The shear zones controlled sulfide deformation, remobilization \n\nand reconcentration, more actively in the breccia ore and sheared types, and less actively in \n\nmatrix and disseminated ores. Primary basal massive sulfides concentrations, changing \n\ngradually at the top to matrix ore, and this to disseminated ore still preserve the original \n\nzoning of the deposit. The footwall banded iron formation hosted-ore was entirely formed by \n\ntectonic-metamorphic processes. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe first economically significant massive sulfide deposit of Ni-Cu in Brazil was discovered \n\nin 1983 at the southwest of the State of Minas Gerais (Fig. 1), the Fortaleza de Minas deposit \n\n(formerly named O`Toole). It is a medium size deposit of about 6 Mt of ore with an average \n\ngrade of 2.5 % Ni, 0.4 % Cu, 0.05 % Co and 0.7 g/t PGM. Mining was started by Minera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nSerra da Fortaleza (Rio Tinto Group) in 1998 and the deposit should be depleted by mid 2007. \n\n \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 33 \n\n \n\nFig 1. Location map of the Fortaleza de Minas Ni-Cu-Co deposit and litho-structural framework of \nsouthwestern Minas Gerais region. \n\nThe deposit was firstly described by Brenner et al. (1990). It is associated to a volcano-\n\nsedimentary sequence which is part of the Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt in the granite-\n\ngreenstone terrain of the southwest of Minas Gerais (Teixeira and Danni, 1979a,b). When \n\ncompared to other similar deposits described in worldwide literature, significant similarities \n\ncan be noted of geological context, embedding lithotypes, mineralization, chemistry of host \n\nrocks, volcanogenic aspects, ore types and geological evolution (Marston et al., 1981; \n\nNaldrett and Campbell, 1982; Hutchinson et al. 1982; Marston, 1984; Hill et al., 1995; Barnes \n\net al., 1995; Riganti and Wilson, 1995; Perring et al., 1995). It has been acknowledged that \n\nthe geometric configuration of the orebody reflects a tectonic remobilization and \n\nreconcentration of ore overprinted on a recognizable primary mineralization setting (Brenner \n\net al., 1990). This is demonstrated by detailed litho-structural surveys carried out on land \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 34 \n\nsurface and in a 650 m long exploratory drift, as well as new assays of borehole samples. \n\nResults are explained in this article. \n\nRegional Geology \n\nThe regional geology is summarized in Fig. 1. The Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary cover \n\nand associated Mesozoic diabase sills from the Paran\u00e1 Basin are shown in the western side. \n\nThe pelites and limestones in the north are related to the Bambu\u00ed Group; they represent the \n\nfilling of a Neoproterozoic basin which was inverted, with shearing and metamorphism of \n\ngreenschist facies during the Brasiliano Cycle (0.6-0.5 Ga), as a part of the Bras\u00edlia Belt. In \n\naddition to these units, a volcano-sedimentary sequence, an older granite-gneissic complex \n\nand a greenstone belt are present in the region, as follows: \n\n \n\nThe metavolcano-sedimentary sequence of Arax\u00e1 and Canastra groups are represented by \n\nmicaschists, quartzites, metagraywackes, paragneisses and secondly by metalimestones, calc-\n\nsilicate rocks, amphibolites and metaultramafic rocks, the latest interpreted as ophiolites. The \n\ntwo units were not fully detailed and are referred to herein as Arax\u00e1/Canastra. They \n\nexperienced greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism, with isogrades inversion, and \n\nwere displaced together by thrust zones overlying against the older complex, which is now \n\nexposed in the core of an deeply eroded anticlinorial structure (Zanardo, 1992; Morales, 1993; \n\nZanardo et al., 1996). Their age has been considered as Neoproterozoic, related to a basin \n\nfilling and inversion during the Brasiliano Cycle (900 - 520 Ma), (Trouw and Pankhurst, \n\n1993; Soares et al., 1994). \n\n \n\nThe oldest units are represented by the Varginha and Barbacena Complexes both including \n\nremnants of metavolcano-sedimentary supracrustals. The Varginha Complex is made up of \n\ntonalitic to granitic gneisses metamorphosed in the granulite facies and retrometamorphosed \n\nin medium to low grades. The associated supracrustals are paragneisses, kinzigites, quartzites, \n\nmicaschists, marbles, calc-silicate rocks, magnetite-bearing BIFs, amphibolites and \n\nmetaultramafic rocks, and were described as Caconde Group (Zanardo, 1992). The Varginha \n\nComplex represents the high-grade terrain of the Alfenas Granulitic Belt (Hasui et al., 1993). \n\nThe Barbacena Complex gathers (1) more or less migmatized monzogranitic to granodioritic \n\ngneisses, (2) banded, augen and laminated biotite and/or hornblende gneisses, and (3) sparse \n\nbodies of orthoamphibolitic rocks, like amphibolites, amphibole schists and amphibole \n\ngneisses (Hasui et al., 1993). Metamorphism of high amphibolite facies and \n\nretrometamorphism occurred. The associated supracrustals are essentially metaultramafic and \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 35 \n\nmetamafic rocks, BIFs, schists and varying quartzites, deemed to be portions of a greenstone \n\nbelt. The older units display a complex structural pattern and its understanding has been \n\nsought since early '60s (Ebert, 1968; Hasui and Oliveira, 1984). Most recent geological and \n\ngeophysical studies show that the general structural framework corresponds to a joining zone \n\nof two crustal blocks, named Bras\u00edlia and S\u00e3o Paulo, which represent two paleo-plates \n\nseparated by the Alterosa Suture Zone (Fig. 1); the Arax\u00e1/ Canastra sequence is interpreted as \n\ndeposited in a passive margin basin of the Bras\u00edlia block (Hasui et al., 1993; Ebert and Hasui, \n\n1998). \n\n \n\nThe collisional processes have developed a thrust system, which was affected by a late or \n\nsubsequent strike-slip belt, the prevailing conditions varying from ductile to brittle, under \n\ntemperatures of amphibolite facies/kyanite zone, having attained anatexis, decreasing to that \n\nof low greenschist facies (Zanardo, 1992; Morales, 1993). In the thrust system, there was \n\nsegmentation and transport of the units to form an assemblage of alloctonous, and \n\nanastomosing, lentiform or sigmoidal masses. Foliation of several kinds (layering, \n\ncompositional banding, schistosity, gneissosity, mylonitic foliation), mineral and stretching \n\nlineations, countless shear zones and shear bands, and folds of different styles and directions, \n\nare the most significant features observed in the area. Movement is connected to the \n\nsubduction nearly southwestward of the Brasilia paleo-plate under the S\u00e3o Paulo paleo-plate, \n\nand lifting of the upper block crust base, represented by the Alfenas Granulitic Belt. The \n\nstrike-slip system, known as Campo do Meio, is a series of sinistral NW-trending strike-slip \n\nzones, responsible for the sigmoid-shaped domains observed from regional to microscopic \n\nscale in all lithotypes (Morales, 1993). A number of lens-shaped bodies of metavolcanic and \n\nmetasedimentary rocks of two assemblages can be distinguished (Fig. 2a). \n\n \n\nThe northernmost bodies in the Fortaleza de Minas-Alpin\u00f3polis region represent parts of the \n\nMorro do Ferro Greenstone Belt, which, together with the Barbacena Complex, configure a \n\ngranite-greenstone terrain of Archean age. Sulfide mineralization and ultramafic flows appear \n\nin this greenstone belt, the latter with thicknesses of some hundred meters and even more, \n\ndisplaying spinifex textures and predominant komatiitic chemistry, in addition to BIFs of \n\noxide, sulfide, silicate facies, and graphitic cherts (Teixeira et al., 1987; Brenner et al., 1990; \n\nCarvalho, 1990; Carvalho et al., 1996). Metamorphism was of amphibolite facies. Fig. 2b \n\nshows a detail of the area where the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is located. \n\n \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 36 \n\n \n \nFig 2. Geological map of Fortaleza de Minas area. \n\nThe assemblage of the Jacu\u00ed-Pet\u00fania-Nova Resende region is related to the Arax\u00e1/Canastra \n\ngroups, and display mafic-ultramafic rocks interpreted as ophiolitic, associated to quartzites \n\nand schists. Several uneconomic bodies of asbestos and podiform chromite are present, and \n\nalso alluvial gold old workings (Carvalho, 1990; Zanardo, 1992; Zanardo et al., 1996). In \n\nsome places, in special in the Jacu\u00ed region, the thickness of flows can be seen, as well as \n\nintermingled meta-sediments, metamorphism of amphibolite facies, chemistry of mafic-\n\nultramafic rocks and metallogenetic patterns different from those which can be noticed in the \n\nnorthernmost bodies. \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 37 \n\nLocal Geology \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas deposit is located near the homonymous village (Fig. 2b). It is over \n\n1,700 m long, varying from 2 to l5 m in thickness, and known depths of more than 700 m, \n\ndisplaying a sinuous tabular form with dips varying from vertical to 70\u00b0 SW. Fig. 3 shows a \n\nNW-SE cross-section to illustrate the general stratigraphy and structure deduced by field data \n\nand supported by exploration drills. The ore host rocks form the O`Toole Sequence and \n\ncomprises three stratigraphic units referred to as Lower, Intermediary and Upper (Brenner et \n\nal., 1990). \n\n \n\nFig 3. Litho-structural SW-NE cross-section interpreted after drilling and gravimetric profiles. \n\nThe Upper and Lower units show several similarities. These start as basalt flows of komatiitic \n\ncomposition, containing restricted tholeitic basalt insertions and sulfide-bearing basaltic \n\nmetatuffs, closely associated to sulfide graphitic metacherts. Rarely flows show a spinifex \n\ntexture and the top of the lower unit is marked by BIF of oxide facies. The Intermediate Unit, \n\ninformally known as the O\u2019Toole Sequence, consists of four differentiated ultramafic volcanic \n\nflows. Cyclicity of volcanic processes is well individualized thanks to the presence of a BIF at \n\nthe top of each one. All flows begin with serpentinites after olivine cumulates at the base, \n\nfollowed by clinopyroxenite with high Ca contents, low contents of Al and horizons of \n\northocumulate texture; the pyroxenite grade up to metagabbros (amphibolites) in the upper \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 38 \n\nportion, which are on their turn covered by BIF a few centimeters up to 20 m thick. The upper \n\ncycle, informally known as the O\u2019Toole Mineralized Cycle, which is more uniform and \n\npersistent on the sides, hosts in its base portion, the Fortaleza de Minas massive sulfide \n\ndeposit. The ore body, at the footwall, shows a basal contact with the preceding BIF cycle, \n\nand is covered by massive serpentinite (average thickness of 13 m), which are followed by \n\nclinopyroxenite (up to l5 m thick), subsequently by amphibolite, representing the thickest unit \n\nof such cycle (thickness of approximately 20 m), and lastly by a BIF (about 12 m thick), as \n\nshown on Fig. 4. The contacts between ore and hosts and among the different ore types are \n\npredominantly sheared. Recently the Inermediate Unit described in Brenner et al., 1990 has \n\nbeen interpreted as thick higly fractionated flows formed in a lava lake distal environment \n\n(Brenner and Carvalho, 2006). \n\n \n\nFig 4. Schematic stratigraphic section of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit. After Brenner et al. (1990), \nwith modifications. Not to scale. \n\nOre Types \n\nFour main ore types are identified from hanging wall to footwall: disseminated, matrix, \n\nbreccia and BIF-hosted ore. They can be distinguished by their sulfide content and grades, \n\nhost rock and gangue mineralogy and by textural and structural features. The fine grain \n\ndisseminated sulfides that occur in the serpentinite host in the upper limit of the mineralized \n\nzone form the disseminated ore. It is composed of 5 to 7% sulfides, 8 to 10% magnetite and \n\n85% silicate gangue, the silicate gangue being dominantly antigorite with minor talc, \n\ntremolite and chlorite. Photo 1 (Plate 1) displays fine grain sulfide dissemination in an \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 39 \n\nantigorite matrix with local concentrations of sulfide along the foliation and P, X, R and T \n\ntype discontinuities. Laterally, along sheared contact zones, this ore type becomes strongly \n\ndeformed, giving rise to a sub-type called sheared ore (Photo 2, Plate 1). \n\n \n\nPLATE 1. Mesoscopic features of the Fortaleza de Minas ore types.

Photo 6 - Typical framework of the BIF-hosted ore with sulfides \nbeing controlled by discontinuities of several types. Note fine grain sulfides following banding and \nbreccia ore veinlet cutting the ore. With increasing deformation the almond-like pieces of BIF are \nbroken apart and assimilated by the breccia ore. \n \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 40 \n\nThe matrix ore is characterized by a sulfides and oxides matrix involving serpentine \n\npseudomorphs of cumulus olivine. The original cumulus olivines were fully replaced by \n\nantigorite. The typical ore composition includes 30% sulfides, and 10% magnetite in a \n\nserpentine groundmass. Photo 3 (Plate 1) shows interstitial sulfides in an antigorite \n\ngroundmass. This ore type is also known as net textured ore. \n\n \nThe breccia ore is a tectonic breccia with a massive sulfide matrix and lithic fragments of \n\nvaried proportions and sizes of BIF, serpentinite and talc schist. Its matrix is made up of 60 to \n\n70% sulfides, 10% oxides and 10 to 20% silicates. They represent the highest grade ore in the \n\ndeposit. Photo 4 (Plate 1) displays a typical breccia ore with a BIF fragment with internal \n\nfolding and small faults from a former deformation. Photo 5 (Plate 1) shows breccia ore with \n\nrock fragments in a sulfide matrix. \n\n \nThe BIF-hosted ore corresponds to sulfide concentrations along bands and discontinuities in \n\nthe footwall BIF, commonly in contact with the breccia ore. It has a variable composition, \n\nnormally 65 to 90% silicate gangue, 5 to 15% sulfides and 5 to 20% magnetite. Photo 6 (Plate \n\n1) shows sulfides along discontinuities and intergranular spaces in the BIF-hosted ore. \n\nAccording to the Ni grade and total sulfide content, ore types can be grouped into high grade \n\nore (> 2% Ni), represented by matrix and breccia ore types, and low grade ore (&lt;2% Ni), \n\nrepresented by disseminated, sheared and BIF hosted ore types. Mineralogical studies \n\nindicated three main mineral phases: the sulfides, the oxides, and the silicates. Pyrrhotite, \n\npentlandite and chalcopyrite dominate the sulfide phase. The oxide phase is largely magnetite, \n\nlocally Cr-bearing, and subordinate Ti-magnetite, Mg-ferrite, ilmenite and Fe-chromite. The \n\nsilicate gangue comprises a Mg-rich and a Fe-rich types. The Mg-rich gangue is, in \n\ndecreasing order, serpentine (antigorite), tremolite, actinolite, clinochlore, magnesite and \n\ndolomite. It occurs dominantly in disseminated, matrix and breccia ore types. The Fe-rich \n\ngangue is represented by amphiboles, such as cummingtonite, Fe-actinolite, typically in the \n\nBIF hosted ore and in the BIF fragments from the breccia ore. In addition to the major ore \n\nminerals, there occurs on an accessory basis a wide variety of minerals of the cobaltite group \n\n(cobaltite-gersdorffite series) included in pyrrhotite, pentlandite and magnetite, nickel \n\ntelluride (melonite) and bismuth, and traces of platinum group minerals (PGM) included in \n\nmagnetite and pyrrhotite. Sphalerite, galena, tetradimite, nicolite and more scarcely valerite-\n\nmaaknawite also appear as accessories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 41 \n\nThe surface alteration processes, acting on the orebody, generated an assembly of \n\nsupergenous minerals, represented by the general development of violarite at the expenses of \n\npentlandite and pyrrhotite, and specifically in the location by the formation of pyrite and \n\nmarcasite from pyrrhotite. Closer to the surface, the ore changes to a mass of limonite/goethite \n\nwith a cellular texture and other mineral residue characteristically generated as a product of \n\nweathering, constituting a typical gossan. Fig. 5 presents the map of the deposit (5a) and a \n\ndetail of the northwestern third (5b). The different ore types can be individualized in the form \n\nof lenticular bodies of varying sizes, irregularly distributed along the deposit. The \n\ndisseminated and matrix ore types are restricted to the central portion of the deposit between \n\nsections 1,300N and 1,900N and above level 800 m in the area identified as embayment. They \n\noccur typically above the basal breccia ore, and the disseminated ore is, most of the times, in \n\ncontact with the hanging wall serpentinite. Local shearing, however, may affect the original \n\ndistribution by inter-layering the ore types or by truncating one or more of them. Broad pinch-\n\nand-swell and necking structures are also common where the overall ore width may vary from \n\n1 to 13 m. These ore width variations occur very rapidly along strike and down dip an eggbox \n\npattern. In this central area the BIF-hosted ore is often limited or absent. However, to the \n\nnorth of 1,900N and to the south of 1,300N the BIF hosted ore is well distributed and occurs \n\ntypically associated with sheared ultramafic ore and breccia ore. \n\n \n\nFig 5. Simplified geological plan view of the central portion of the Fortaleza the Minas deposit after \nunderground mapping. General view (a) and detail of the northwest portion (b). Riedel model for the \narea indicating the shear zones and tension fractures (c). \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 42 \n\nThe breccia ore is well spread over almost the entire deposit. It forms the basal ore type \n\nassociated with matrix and disseminated ores in the central zone of the deposit or lays within \n\nBIF-hosted and sheared ores in the lateral extensions and at depth. This spatial placement of \n\nthe different ore types and the distribution of their host rocks indicates the presence of a \n\ncentral primary embayment-like structure outlined by the association \n\ndisseminated/matrix/breccia ores and a broader zone of remobilized ore types represented by \n\nthe association BIF-hosted/sheared/breccia ores (Fig. 6). Both ore width and metal content \n\ndecreases from the central embayment zone away, laterally and at depth. The exploratory drift \n\nwas developed along the northern side of the embayment zone until its limits with the \n\nremobilized zone to the north, from section 1,650N to 2,015N covering different ore types \n\nassociations and tectonic environments. \n\n \n \n\n \nFig 6. Sketch of the embayment structure and main primary ore types. Note paucity of chemical \nsediments (BIF) in the embayment domain. Scale only for reference. \n\nThe word embayment is used here in a broad sense referring to the central thick and rich zone \n\nwere primary ore types were identified. It differs from the typical embayment structures of the \n\nWestern Australian volcanogenic Ni deposits in a few aspects, as follows: (1) the absence of \n\nsteep structures like faults in the lateral limits of the embayment; (2) the presence of Ni ore, \n\nalthough weaker, outside the embayment limits; (3) the lack of a clear elongated shape like \n\nthe structures in the Kambalda area (Stone, 2005; Beresford, 2005). These differences could \n\nbe at least partially explained by the intense deformation and shearing that took place in the \n\nFortaleza deposit. However, it could also indicate that the Fortaleza deposit is in some way \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 43 \n\ndifferent from the classic Australian komatiite-hosted volcanogenic Type 1 deposits (Hill and \n\nGole, 1990; Hill, 2001; Lesher and Keays, 2002). The komatiite-hosted Type 1 deposits refer \n\nto the original therminology volcanic peridotite associated deposits (VPA) in opposition to the \n\nintrusive dunite associated deposits (IDA) (Marston et al., 1981; Marston, 1984), later \n\nreviewed as Type 2 deposits. Type 1 deposits are characterized by accummulations at the base \n\nof komatiite lava flows of massive and matrix or net-textured ores with 40-60wt% of sulfides \n\nas a matrix to original olivines. Type 2 deposits are large low grade sulfide disseminations \n\ncommonly formed in the core of thick olivine cumulate undifferentiated sills. The Ni/Cu ratio \n\nfrom Fortaleza is about 6:1 which places it in between the typical Type 1 deposits (Ni/Cu > \n\n20:1) and the intrusive gabbroic type deposits (Ni/Cu &lt;3:1). Another indication for the \n\nembayment structure is given by the paucity of footwall sulfidic sediments (BIF) in the \n\nembayment area (Fig. 6) and the distribution of the S/Ni ratio in the ore. The S/Ni ratio is \n\ntypically 3.5:1 or 4.0:1 in the central embayment zone and gradually increases to 6:1 and \n\nhigher as we move laterally and also downwards (down dip and along strike) from the \n\nembayment zone. \n\nDEPOSIT AND HOST ROCKS STRUCTURES \n\nLarger Structures \n\nThe metavolcano-sedimentary pile of the Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt forms an assembly \n\nof wedge-shaped bodies imbedded in rocks of the Barbacena Complex. Such bodies with \n\ngeneral NW-SE trend are delimited by sinistral brittle-ductile strike-slip shear zones. In the \n\ndeposit area there appears one such feature (Fig. 2). The supracrustals are bounded by a \n\nprincipal strike-slip shear zone at southwest and another one in the northeastern side (Fig. 3); \n\nthe last one and several inner secondary shear zones have slip with dip components, to which \n\nis related the tilting of wedge-shaped blocks towards southwest and the distribution of the \n\nstratigraphic units in the section. The general framework is a negative flower structure, a \n\ntranstensional feature related to the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System. \n\n \n\nThe sketch of Fig. 5c is the Riedel model for a left-hand NW-SE simple shear recognized in \n\nregional scale (Fig. 1), indicating the direction of the several types of shear zones (P, Y or D, \n\nR, X and R\u2019) and tension fracture (T). Host rocks and parts of the ore body are broken up into \n\nother smaller bodies through several smaller strike-slip zones, so that the structure is marked \n\nby anastomosed pattern of juxtaposed lentiform portions, which is reflected in the sinuous \n\ntracings of the several lithotypes and ore, and may be observed from large to microscopic \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 44 \n\nscales (Santos 1996). \n\nIn addition to the shear zone of the southern border, of general direction N45W and high dip \n\ntowards southwest, such smaller strike-slip zones have general directions around NNW-SSE, \n\nWNW-ESE, NW-SE and NE-SW, and high-angle dips, which correspond respectively to P, \n\nR, Y e R' in the Riedel model. Kinematic indicators show that displacements were dextral for \n\nR' zones and sinistral for the others, consistent with the overall sinistral movement of the \n\nCampo do Meio Strike-Slip System. \n\n \n\nThe ore shows a mylonitic foliation, as a rule parallel to the schistosity, layering and \n\ncompositional banding of the lithotypes present therein. This foliation has a preferred \n\ndirection about N47W/sub-vertical (Fig. 7a), with anastomosed fabric around smaller \n\nlenticular bodies. To this foliation are associated mineral and stretching lineations defined by \n\nthe direction and elongation of amphibole, quartz, magnetite e sulfide, with general \n\nN47W/sub-horizontal orientation (Fig. 7b). A stretching lineation around N30E/85SW can \n\nalso be observed (close to the center of the Fig. 7b stereogram), and which is parallel to axis \n\nY of the finite deformation ellipsoid; it is interpreted as a structure generated during the \n\nearlier thrust movement and rotated by the later strike-slip displacement. \n\n \n \n\n \n \nFig 7. Stereograms of the foliation (a) and stretching lineation (b) in the mine area. \n \n \nFolds are not rare in the area. Those of the intrafolial type may be better noticed in the BIFs, \n\ndisplaying sizes ranging from millimeters to centimeters, styles from closed to isoclinal, axial \n\nplanes parallel to the mylonitic foliation and axis parallel to the stretching lineation. Drag \n\nfolds are common in the exploration drift, both on the ore and also in the host rocks. In \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 45 \n\naddition to these features, crenulations and kink bands also appear, following in one or more \n\ndirections in the schistified portions of hosts. Besides these brittle-ductile deformation \n\nfeatures, another important assembly of structures generated in a last brittle regime can also \n\nbe seen, represented by faults and joints. \n\n \n\nFaults are noticeable features, marked by cataclastic rocks and slickensides, continuous for 2 \n\nto 3 m and in directions NW-SE, WNW-ESE, NE-SW e NNE-SSW, predominantly of strike-\n\nslip type and sub-vertical. To these are associated remobilized sulfides, particularly pyrrhotite \n\nand chalcopyrite, with a frequent presence of carbonates, forming sigmoids and filling tension \n\ngashes. There are also normal faults with direction WNW-ESE and subordinately NW-SE, \n\nfrequently filled with chrysolite, carbonate, pyrite or limonite. Fault surfaces were preferably \n\nnucleated along the existent shear zones. \n\n \n\nSeveral crossed joint sets are present in the deposit area, particularly with NW-SE, WNW-\n\nESE, NE-SW and NNE-SSW directions. The NW-SE and WNW-ESE sets are mainly \n\nresponsible for water percolation and supergenic alteration of the deposit. This two joint sets, \n\nalong with NNE-SSW faults, are coincident with the Y, R and R\u00b4 Riedel directions \n\ndetermined for the area. All such features may be attributed to the same tectonic system which \n\noriginated the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip Belt, which allows to consider that the strike-slip \n\nmovement event began under amphibolite facies temperature conditions and progressively \n\nwent on until reaching the stage of brittle behavior. \n\nSmaller Structures \n\nThe shear zones and faults have deeply affected the original mineralization, by introducing \n\nnew structures, remobilization, transformations and reconcentration of ore, in a transtensive \n\ncontext, that is to say, tectonic and metamorphic processes were important in the \n\nconformation of the deposit. The different ore types are greatly affected by brittle-ductile \n\nshear zones P, Y, R e R'. T surfaces have also developed in more competent lithotypes. The \n\nseveral types of surfaces do not appear separately, but show overlaying and interactions which \n\nmay be rather complex, as is normal in deformation by non-coaxial shear. Simpler situations \n\nof two sets of surfaces successively developed can be better seen on disseminated ore, where \n\nsulfides tend to be arranged according to an anastomosed structure, mainly defined by \n\nsurfaces R e P (Photomicrography 1, Plate 2). In the remnants of serpentinites one can clearly \n\nidentify structures of the S-C type, defined by large and sigmoidal serpentines (S) and by \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 46 \n\nplanes and overlaying brittle-ductile shear zones (C). More complex situations result from the \n\nintervention of more than two types de planes: structures developed by surfaces R, intersected \n\nby other surfaces P and subsequently by R\u2019 zones, stand out since the last two delineate a \n\nnearly orthogonal reticular structure (Photomicrography 2, Plate 2). In these events, features \n\nof the S-C-type tend to be destroyed. \n\n \nPLATE 2. Microscopic features of the Fortaleza de Minas ore types. Photomicrography 1 - Matrix \nore displaying sulfides concentration in the shear planes and intersections (R and P). As deformation \nincreases the anatomosed fabric takes place. Photomicrography 2 - Disseminated ore showing \ncomplex orthogonal reticular structure possibly formed by the influence of R\u2019 shear zones over pre-\nexisting structures of R and P types. Photomicrography 3 - Breccia ore displaying block textured \npentlandites and subordinately incipient lenticular shapes. Photomicrography 4 - Flake-like and \nintergrowth textures displayed by the disseminated ore. Photomicrography 5 - Matrix ore showing \npyrrhotite and pentlandite surrounding and individualizing serpentine grains, possibly derived after \nolivines. Photomicrography 6 - Typical polycrystalline pyrrhotite where the pentlandite is present as \nsmall aggregates that are developed along the contacts and triple junctions of pyrrhotite crystals. \n \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 47 \n\nAlong surfaces there occurred a general recrystallization of antigorite which shows \n\nintergrowth with other pre-existing serpentines. Inside some lenses one can notice \n\nrecrystallization of the serpentine along planes perpendicular to the stretching lineation, with \n\nthe development of an intergrowth texture of sulfide and magnetite, suggesting that this \n\ntexture occurs in portions less damaged by shear. As a rule, sulfides and oxides have also \n\nsuffered from recrystallization, with an increase in granulation. Sulfides are represented \n\npredominantly by pyrrhotite displaying intergrowth with flake-like crystals of antigorite well \n\ndeveloped and secondarily with magnetite. Pyrrhotite masses show evidence of mobility, \n\nwhereas the pentlandite aggregates, with a less ductile behavior, acquire lenticular shapes \n\n(Photomicrography 3, Plate 2). \n\nDisseminated Ore \n\nDissemination occurs under the form of intergrowth textures of silicate+sulfide, \n\nsilicate+sulfide+magnetite, or silicate+magnetite, preferably oriented along brittle-ductile \n\nshear planes. Silicate in the intergrowth textures is predominantly serpentine, but may also \n\noccur as carbonate e chlorite (Photomicrography 4, Plate 2). Two types de microstructures are \n\npresent, orthogonal reticular and anastomosed, the first predominating. In the sheared ore, the \n\northogonal reticular pattern tends to give way to the anastomosed oriented according to the \n\nmajor foliation and transitional features are rather common. Late right or left-lateral faults and \n\nsome veins filled with chalcopyrite and/or magnetite and/or pyrrhotite and recrystallized \n\ncarbonate are relatively common. Pyrrhotite forms lenses oriented parallel to foliation, \n\nmigrating in the direction of these faults and veins. Lenses occur in an aggregate manner, with \n\npyrrhotite showing a polygonal texture resulting from annealing, with intergranular \n\npentlandite (locally altered to bravoite-violarite), sometimes sphalerite, and also by \n\nchalcopyrite. The disseminated ore behaved in a stiffer manner toward deformation, due to its \n\nlesser quantity of sulfides, presenting only an inner rearrangement of the latter at a \n\nmicroscopic level and without the evidence of deformation noticed in massive breccia ore. \n\nMatrix Ore \n\nAlthough displaying a geological and mineralogical evolution similar to the disseminated ore, \n\nthe matrix ore behaved in a more ductile manner toward regional deformation. Such behavior \n\nis due to the greater proportion of the sulfide and oxide phases, which originally surrounded \n\nindividual olivine cumulate crystals (forsterite), magnetite and chromite. Continuous \n\nmovement along the shear zones promoted extensive recrystallization and mineralogical and \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 48 \n\ntextural changes in the ore. Thereby sulfides, specially pyrrhotite, pentlandite and \n\nchalcopyrite form chained arrangements, intergranular to antigorite, Fe-chromite and \n\nmagnetite, which represent respectively the original olivine, chromite and magnetite \n\n(Photomicrography 5, Plate 2). Recrystallizations are noticed particularly in pentlandite, \n\nwhich forms coarse grain lentiform aggregates parallel to the mylonitic formation. Pyrrhotite \n\noccurs in polycrystalline aggregates with polygonal contacts due to annealing; pyrrhotite, \n\ncontrary to pentlandite, had a more mobile behavior, adjusting among silicate and oxide \n\nminerals. Antigorite, iron-chromite and magnetite also as a rule present lenticular forms and \n\ntextures of intergrowth with sulfides. These features occur controlled by zones R or P and, \n\nlocally, Y. The orthogonal reticular pattern is visible only in lenticularised antigorite masses, \n\nwhich show a stiffer behavior toward deformation. In addition to the lenticular aspect, \n\nantigorite also displays sigmoidal forms at places saved from intense deformation. Small \n\nconcentrations of sulfides, magnetite and Fe-chromite intergrow with antigorite, occur in the \n\ninner shear planes of such lenses, subdividing it into smaller lenses. In some places one can \n\nnote predominance, stronger persistence and continuity of the R shear zones as compared to \n\nP, or vice-versa. In all shear zones R, P and Y, which control the matrix ore, small quantities \n\nof talc and carbonates (magnesite) occur, exhibiting strong deformation (mylonitic and \n\nschlieren type structures). Late ore occurs filling extension fractures T, generally consisting \n\nonly of chalcopyrite and sporadically pyrrhotite in the central region and chalcopyrite (later \n\non) or magnetite and chalcopyrite at the ends. Chalcopyrite is frequently presented as millerite \n\nalong the cleavage planes and fractures, or as small-embedded grains; it shows gemination, \n\northogonal spear-shaped flakes in between, and also recrystallization forming a \n\npolycrystalline mass consisting of polygonal sub-grains. Pyrrhotite in these veins frequently \n\noccurs as polygonal sub-grains, in general associated with pentlandite also as polygonal sub-\n\ngrains, and likewise with exsolutions of a flame pentlandite, partially altered to bravoite-\n\nviolarite. Traces of cobaltite can be noticed, particularly included in magnetite. Frequent \n\nsulfide inclusions are present in magnetites. Sphalerite occurs in small quantities included in \n\nmagnetite or as exsolution flakes in pentlandite. \n\nBreccia Ore \n\nAs happens with the other types, the massive breccia is presented metamorphosed, deformed, \n\nrecrystallized, and with silicate-sulfide, oxide-sulfide and silicate-oxide intergrowth textures, \n\nalways controlled by shear zones, in a manner similar to what is seen in the richer portions of \n\nmatrix ore. Ratios between the limits of sulfide, silicate and oxide grains are more varied, \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 49 \n\nreflecting the nature of inclusions and/or lithic fragments present in it. Such fragments are \n\nmineralogically heterogeneous and derivate, in varying proportions, from ultramafic rocks \n\nand from BIFs, both metamorphosed and tectonized. Normally they show ductile and brittle \n\ndeformation prior to their engulfing by massive sulfide (Photo 4, Plate 1). As a rule, pre-\n\nexisting fractures in these clasts are filled by chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and secondarily by \n\npentlandite, which represent remobilization processes subsequent to the formation and \n\ndeformation of the major ore which occurs as the matrix for the clasts. However, they also \n\nshow evidences of recrystallization and deformation. Mineralogically, inclusions consist of \n\nserpentines, chlorites, various types of amphibole of the tremolite/actinolite/iron-actinolite \n\nand cummingtonite/gr\u00fcnerite series, and fine elongated aggregates of talc and chlorite. The \n\nsulfide phase (pyrrhotite, pentlandite) occurring as a matrix presents intense recrystallization, \n\nconstituting crystalline aggregates with polygonal arrangements. Intergrowth textures of \n\nsulfides with antigorite, magnetite and iron-chromite are common and similar to those \n\noccurring in matrix ore. Pyrrhotites in particular host outer granular exsolutions of \n\npentlandite, developed in the interface with the silicate phases, acquiring larger sizes at \n\ncontact points and triple seams of polycrystal aggregates (Photomicrography 6, Plate 2). More \n\nrarely there occur small quantities of pentlandites, developed as exsolution bodies in the shape \n\nof a flame within pyrrhotites. Both such types of exsolution are recrystallized and are \n\ncommon features in this type of ore. These features exhibited by the massive breccia ore, like \n\nall others, indicate the operation of successive tectonic events upon a pre-existing \n\nmonosulfide solid solution and its derivates. Such modifications are particularly outstanding \n\nat places where the brittle-ductile shear zones R, P and Y, as well as the extension zones T, \n\nhave enabled ore remobilization and reconcentration. Millimetric and centimetric size \n\nlenticular fragments of serpentinites and BIF, lodged and oriented by sulfide flows in Y shear \n\nzones, laterally grade toward regions where the flow was less intense and as a result \n\nfragments are less oriented (Photo 6, Plate 1). Such features show that the sulfide \n\nremobilization at first penetrated in the host walls controlled by structures R and P, which \n\nprogressively have engulfing and tearing out the almond-shaped fragments from the host, \n\nwhich then become a part of the ore body. At places, where these fragments are incorporated \n\nby Y shear zones, they are presented disperses and/or oriented parallel to mylonitic foliation. \n\nIn lenses new subordinate penetrations of sulfides, predominantly chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite, \n\ncan occur along the inner foliation, zones R and P, and subordinately from fractures; such \n\nsulfides also present recrystallizations, and seem to be associated to the last deforming event \n\nwhich operated upon the deposit. In those areas showing more active remobilization \n\nprocesses, one can notice in microscopic and mesoscopic scale, narrow and continuous \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 50 \n\nparallel beds of recrystallized pentlandite, of a more brittle behavior than pyrrhotite. It can \n\nalso be noticed in serpentinite fragments the presence of pressure shadows of the ? and ? \n\ntypes filled by pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite. Magnetite, Fe-chromite and antigorite, \n\noccurring as small anastomosed grains inside the sulfide matrix and inside serpentinitic \n\nlenses, progressively migrate toward the shear planes. When present inside Y zone, magnetite \n\nand iron-chromite are drawn. Platinoids occur as small inclusions in magnetite and pyrrhotite. \n\nIt is relatively frequent the presence of extensional fractures and microscopic recrystallized \n\ncarbonate veins (magnetite and Fe-dolomite), with elongated sub-grains and wavy extinction, \n\nhaving associated sulfides and magnetite; such fractures and veins show that they have been \n\naffected by a left- or right-lateral strike-slip movement. This carbonate is encompassed by the \n\nsulfide mass in some places. \n\nBIF-hosted Ore \n\nThis ore type, of local occurrence, in the embayment area, genetically differs from the \n\nmagmatic disseminated, matrix and massive breccia ores. In this case, mineralization takes \n\nplace by filling cracks, fractures, faults and other structures existing in BIFs (oxide, silicate, \n\nsulfide facies) that are in contact with massive breccia ore in the footwall (Photomicrography \n\n5, Plate 2). This is a mineralization process whose origin is related to metamorphic and \n\ntectonic processes that have provoked and controlled mobilization of pre-existing sulfides \n\n(magmatic) on the basis of ultramafic flows for the BIF, their current hosts. Mineralogical \n\nassociations which constitute this ore, except for the silicate association introduced by the \n\nBIF, are strictly the same which constitute the other ore already described herein, with a \n\npredomination of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, Fe-chromite etc. The new \n\nsilicate phase is mainly formed by amphiboles, such as cummingtonite and/or Fe-actinolite, in \n\naddition to quartz, and more locally carbonate, Fe-pyrosmalite and chlorite. Despite occurring \n\nlate, it can be noticed in the ore complex intergrowth textures among sulfides, oxides and \n\nsilicates, a general recrystallization of sulfides and quartz, evidencing that it same have \n\nsuffered at least partially a tectonic and metamorphic evolution similar to that of magmatic \n\nore. The major structural control in the formation of this ore is related to shear zones R, P and \n\nY, which serve as main conduct for sulfide mobilization. Such deformation, visible in all \n\nobservation scales, led to the formation of varying size lenses of a BIF, which on its turn may \n\nbe subdivided into smaller lenses. Depending on the continuity of this process and the \n\nproximity of massive breccia ore, these lenses have been incorporated and absorbed by this \n\nore, or were replaced, in part or fully in situ. Sulfide ore, in particular concentrated along the \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 51 \n\ntension gashes, spaces between boudins and along faults, display to be strongly recrystallized, \n\nintergrowth textures and polygonal textures of pentlandite exsolution in pyrrhotite, similar to \n\nthat described above in disseminated, matrix and breccia ore. \n\nTectono-metamorphic evolution of the  deposit \n\nDespite the transformations suffered by the Fortaleza de Minas deposit and its host, the \n\nmineral paragenesis by pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite and magnetite, present all around \n\nthe massive breccia, matrix and disseminated ore, constitutes a strong evidence indicating that \n\nthe formation of same is connected to ultramafic lava fractionating processes. Furthermore, \n\ntextural and phase relations among such sulfides, in conformity with modern genetic models, \n\ne.g., the billiard-ball model (Naldret, 1973; Naldrett and Campbell, 1982; Lesher et al., 1984; \n\nLesher and Stone, 1996; Naldrett, 2005), prove that they represent solidification products \n\nfrom a monosulfide solid solution (MSS), subsequently modified by metamorphism and \n\ndeformation. These tectonic processes recorded on the ore and its hosts due to the presence of \n\nshear zone, mylonitisation, cataclasis, recrystallization and textural modifications, indicate the \n\nevolution history of the deposit, affecting the primary embayment structure proposed by \n\nBrenner et al. (1990), schematically presented in Fig. 6. The first transformations could \n\nperhaps be related to the brittle-ductile thrust in the beginning of the collisional process; \n\nhowever, despite deformation and metamorphism having taken place under thermal \n\nconditions of amphibolite facies, no mineral transformations nor changes in the primary \n\nstratigraphic disposition of the deposit was not identified. This difficulty is due to the marked \n\noperation of the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System, which later on superimposed the \n\ncollisional process. Strike-slip displacements imposed a near verticalization of lithotypes and \n\nthe deposit, as well as the now noted transformations, which took place under temperatures \n\nconsistent with the greenschist and lower facies. In addition to one of the larger shear zones, \n\nin the deposit can be seen several smaller zones of varying orientations, besides all kinds of \n\ndiscontinuities, features which have developed in succession and involved repeated sulfide \n\nremobilization and mineralogical alterations. \n\nConclusions \n\nCollisional processes in southwestern Minas Gerais have developed an extensive thrust \n\nsystem, upon which later on the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System superimposed, which \n\nimposed upon the region a structure of varying size wedge-shaped bodies, including to the \n\nMorro do Ferro Greenstone Belt. The belt located to the south of Fortaleza de Minas, which \n\n\n\nTectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 52 \n\nhosts the Ni-Cu-Co deposit, has a general orientation around NW-SE, is delimited by an \n\nanticlockwise strike-slip shear zone at the southwestern border, and has a rather complex \n\ninner structure, involving several other shear zones with slip having significant dip component \n\nin a transtension context, and minor brittle-ductile shear zones of types P, R, Y e R', as well as \n\ndiscontinuities of type T. These structures are related to the sinistral Campo do Meio \n\nTranscurrent System. The thermal conditions of this tectonic event were of the greenschist \n\nfacies, going down to lower levels, where the rocks acquired a brittle behavior. Some \n\nsubsequent strike-slip and normal faults are also observed. \n\nAnastomosed geometry of the brittle-ductile shear zone can be noticed as from the scale of \n\nhost masses and the several ore types (breccia, matrix, disseminated and BIF hosted ore), \n\ndown to microscopic lenses of mineral grains. It is admitted that primary sulfides, of \n\nmagmatic origin, should already have been settled as masses of massive type at the base, and \n\ngradually and transitionally passed on to matrix and from this to disseminated at the top. \n\nUpon this assembly processes of strong deformation, remobilization and reconcentration have \n\noperated, controlled by the shear zones and faults. Remobilization on the breccia ore and \n\nlocally on the more sheared terms was more active than on the matrix and disseminated ore, \n\nhaving generated the banded iron formation ore, although the original zoning was maintained. \n\nAknowledgements \n\nThe authors are grateful to Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Serra da Fortaleza by assisting the field investigations \n\nin the exploratory drift and the analysis of borehole samples. \n\nReferences \n\nBarnes, S.J., Lesher, C.M., Keays, R.R., 1995, Geochemistry of mineralized and barren \n\nkomatiites from the Perseverance nickel deposit, Western Australia.

The fractionated flow has been affected by high \n\ngrade metamorphism, folding and intense shearing destroying almost completely its primary \n\nvolcanic textures. Whole rock chemistry  indicates a komatiitic composition although no \n\nspinifex texture has been found so far. Each individual flow unit is fractionated into a basal \n\nolivine-cumulate, a pyroxene-cumulate zone and an upper gabbro zone. The upper flow unit \n\nhosts a Type 1 nickel sulfide mineralization. This flow shows similarity with other \n\nfractionated thick flows (e.g. Fred\u2019s flow from Munro, Township) and contrasts with the \n\nmajority of komatiite related nickel sulfide deposits hosts; normally a thick and channelized \n\northo-cumulate flow laterally capped with spinifex textured thin flows. The volcanic \n\nenvironment for the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow is interpreted as a distal lava lake \n\nponded facies. The Ni deposit host is characterized by a high Cr x Ni signature which \n\ncontrasts with the common low Cr x Ni mineralized channelized flows from the majority of \n\nType 1 deposits. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSince the start up of the mine a great ammount of new data became available regarding the \n\nvolcanic host rocks of the Fortaleza de Minas (formerly O`Toole) deposit (Brenner et al. \n\n1990).  The highly fractionated flow that host the nickel mineralization was strongly affected \n\nby metamorphism and intense deformation resulting in almost complete obliteration of \n\nprimary volcanic textures. The original volcanic rock types were completely transformed \n\nduring metamorphic events but their major chemical composition is considered to be roughly \n\npreserved and still valid for characterization of its original composition. The mineralogical \n\nand petrochemical characteristics of the deposit komatiitic host flow is discussed herein and \n\ncompared to the barren komatiitic flows from the Morro do Ferro greenstone belt in the \n\nGuariroba-Peroba segment. The fractionated flow shows a distinctive mineralogical and \n\nchemical composition when compared to the majority of the komatiite related nickel sulfide \n\ndeposits. For the discussions on komatiite lithologies the igneous terminology is adopted and \n\nthe term meta- is assumed. \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 57 \n\nGeological setting \n\nThe regional geology of the deposit area was described in Brenner et al (1990), Teixeira et al \n\n(1987) and Marchetto et al (1984) and has been reviewed more recently (Zanardo et al, 1996; \n\nZanardo, 1992 and Morales, 1993). The archean Morro do Ferro greenstone belt (Teixeira &amp; \n\nDanni, 1979) occurs at the southern limit of the archean Paramirim craton along a EW \n\ntrending block of granite-greenstone terrain cut by a system of sinistral transcurrent shear \n\nzones (Fig. 1). Sm/Nd isotopic results from the Ni deposit host flow revealed an isochron age \n\nof 2.86 + 65 Ga for the cristalization of the lavas (Pimentel &amp; Ferreira Filho, 2002). \n\nMigmatites from the same area have a Rb/Sr isochron age of 2.92 + 0.11 Ga (Schrank and \n\nSilva, 1993). These ages are compatible to the Piumhi greenstone belt (ca. 2.9 \u2013 3.1 Ga), \n\n(Machado and Schrank, 1989). The granite-greenstone terrain is limited in the South by the \n\narchean Alfenas granulite belt and to the North by Proterozoic supracrustal sediments. In the \n\nGuariroba-Peroba segment, where the Ni deposit is located (Fig. 2), a thick pile of komatiites \n\nand komatiitic basalts occur with subordinate horizons of banded iron formation. The SW \n\nmargin of this greenstone segment is interpreted as the lower portion of the belt which hosts \n\nthe fractionated flows and related Ni sulfide deposit, and the upper portion being represented \n\nby the thick chemical-detritical sediments at the NE margin of the belt in the Peroba area (Fig. \n\n2). The SW margin of this segment is characterized by strong airborne magnetic anomalies \n\nreflecting the higher proportion of komatiites and olivine-cumulates. The Ni deposit is \n\nassociated with a large and strong magnetic anomaly (Fig. 2b).  \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Regional geology of the granite-greenstone terrain in the Fortaleza de Minas area. \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 58 \n\n \n\nFig. 2.

A strong airmag anomaly is \nassociated with the olivine cumulates (serpentinites) that host the Ni-Fe sulfide mineralization. \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 59 \n\nThe major event of folding and regional metamorphism is assumed to be occurred during the \n\npaleoproterozoic Transamazonian Orogeny (2.16 \u2013 2.0 Ga). Metamorphism achieved high \n\namphibolite facies in the deposit area, where temperatures higher than 650 oC are indicated by \n\namphibole paragenesis from the deposit footwall BIF (Fernandes, 1998).  In the Alpin\u00f3polis \n\narea, to the northeast, Szab\u00f3, (1996), reports temperatures for peak metamorphism between \n\n720 to 780 oC and pressures between 3 to 6 kbar. Amphiboles from the footwall banded iron \n\nformation indicated an Ar/Ar cooling age of ca. 2.0 Ga (Fernandes, 1998). By the closure of \n\nthe peak metamorfism the olivine-cumulates were fully converted to massive serpentinites. \n\nOlivine pseudomorphs are the only indication of original olivines. Original chromites were \n\ntransformed into Cr-magnetite. Despite the high metamorphic grade and the intense shearing \n\nobserved in the area, primary cumulate textures have been observed in drill cores and \n\nunderground exposures, mostly in pyroxene-cumulate rocks. Outside the deposit area, where \n\nshearing was less intense, spinifex textures, flow breccia and nodular peridotite can be seen in \n\nscattered outcrops (Brenner et al, 1990). The region was later affected by intense transcurrent \n\nshearing during the Brasiliano Cycle (900 \u2013520 Ma) with reactivation of major regional \n\nfaults. Retrograde metamorphism with temperature not higher than 300oC associated with \n\nintense ductile-brittle shearing promoted partial transformation of serpentinites into talc-\n\ncarbonate schists with high CO2 fluid pressure. Fractionated gabbros from the deposit area \n\nwere converted into actinolite-albite-epidote schist or fels. Undeformed post-tectonic gabbro \n\nand diabase dykes were fully retrograded to greenschist paragenesis in the Brasiliano Cycle \n\nwithout loosing their original magmatic textures (Fig. 3a). These basic dykes are common in \n\nthe region and are assumed to be of mesoproterozoic age. Similar basic dykes, in the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o \n\ndel Rei area, have a Sm/Nd model age of 1.7-1.3 Ga, which dates the beginning of the \n\nBrasiliano neoproterozoic sedimentation (Heilbron et al, 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 60 \n\n \n\nFig. 3.

These flow \n\nunits defined the intermediate sequence or O\u2019Toole sequence, which lies in a thight syncline \n\nbetween a lower and an upper sequence represented by komatiite and komatiitic basalt flows \n\nwith interbedded horizons of graphitic meta-chert, BIF and cherty-tuffs (black shales). The \n\nnickel deposit is hosted by the uppermost cycle or flow unit from the intermediate sequence \n\n(fig. 4). The upper and lower sequences represent the dominant units in the Guariroba-Peroba \n\narea. The intermediate sequence is currently interpreted as a thick highly fractionated flow \n\nwhere the individual cycles represent individual flow units separated by thin BIF. (fig. 5). The \n\nflow units are commonly 50 to 100m thick, except when intensely sheared, and several km \n\nlong, being laterally truncated by shear zones in contact with granitic basement (fig. 6). \n\nAlthough intensely sheared, folded and laterally truncated the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated \n\nflow displays a minimum unfolded length of about 7km long by 2km wide with an average \n\nwidth of 150m. \n\n \n\nFig. 4.

They range from chlorite-tremolite schists and chlorite-talc/serpentine-tremolite \n\nschist to massive serpentinites and talc schists from ortho-cumulates. Metamorphic or \n\nmagmatic olivines are extremely rare in the cumulates. Most of the komatiites of peridotitic \n\nand olivine-peridotite composition are now chlorite-carbonate-talc schists. The komatiitic \n\nbasalts are represented by chlorite-actinolite schists, chlorite-tremolite schists and \n\nplagioclase-actinolite schists where most of the plagioclase is now replaced by epidote and \n\ncarbonate. Common BIF assemblages are quartz-cummingtonite-actinolite-(magnetite) and \n\ncummingtonite-tremolite-magnetite. These assemblages indicate a progressive amphibolite \n\nmetamorfic facies with superimposed retrograde greenschist facies paragenesis. Primary \n\nvolcanic textures such as spinifex and pillow lavas are locally preserved (Fig. 3b).  \n\nMineralogy of the thick fractionated flow \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas deposit host flow has fractionated into three distinct rock types: a \n\nbasal olivine-cumulate zone (SS/TT), an intermediate pyroxene cumulate zone (PI) and an \n\nupper gabbroic zone (AT) (fig. 5). The gradational change from the pyroxene cumulate to \n\ngabbro is marked by the appearence of porfiritic plagioclase building up to a medium \n\nmassive gabbroic texture. The pyroxene cumulate zone is normally quite massive, (except \n\nfor highly sheared zones in the lower flows) and often display one to two internal sub-zones \n\nof preserved adcumulate to meso-cumulate texture. The lower olivine cumulate zone has a \n\nmassive texture and has been fully serpentinized and partially talcified. It is interpreted to \n\ncorrespond to an ortho-cumulate based on its MgO content (33\u201338%) but also by preserved \n\northo-cumulate texture from the matrix ore. The contact with the upper pyroxene cumulate \n\nzone is sharp and commonly slightly sheared but continuous gradational contact has been \n\nalso observed in a few bore holes. The metamorphic mineralogical composition of the \n\ndifferent fractionated zones is shown in Table 1. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 64 \n\nTable 1.

Particularly in \n\nsheared or pinching zones the massive serpentinite can be replaced by chlorite \u2013 carbonate - \n\ntalc schists (TT) with talc ranging from 30-60 wt%, carbonate (dolomite) from 20-50 wt% and \n\nchlorite from 5-20 wt% (Fig. 3d).  Like in the serpentinites magnetite ranges between 10-15 \n\nwt%. Intermediate members between TT and SS are found in transition zones. The \n\nintermediate pyroxene-cumulate zone (PI) is dominantly represented by massive and poorly \n\nfoliated chlorite-tremolite-actinolite schist or fels where tremolite-actinolite normally range \n\nfrom 75-90 wt% (Fig. 3e). Tremolite is much more common but actinolite and hornblend may \n\nbe present. Pyroxene occurs as coarse crystals (augite \u2013 diopside) or as pseudomorphs being \n\nreplaced by tremolite and hornblend. This zone displays one to two internal sub-zones of \n\nmeso-cumulate to ad-cumulate textures with coarse augite \u2013 diposide cumulus within a \n\nhornblend tremolite fine grain matrix with magnetite. Rare plagioclase and talc may be found \n\nin this zone. Petrographic evidences indicate processes of mineral transformation as follows: \n\nPyroxene > hornblende > actinolite-tremolite > chlorite. The upper gabbro zone (AT) is \n\nrepresented by medium grain massive anfibolites where actinolite is dominant (75-85 wt%) \n\nfollowed by plagioclase and/or epidote \u2013 carbonate (Fig. 3f). The original andesine has been \n\nalmost completely transformed into albite + epidote + carbonate. Due to the metamorphic and \n\nshearing processes typical flow tops can no longer be identified. However in the upper contact \n\nwith the chemical sediments, typically oxide facies banded iron formation (Figs. 3g, h), a \n\nzone of fine to very fine grained actinolite-tremolite schist is observed in many places and are \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 65 \n\nalso commonly associated with carbonate veinlets or stringers. These features are interpreted \n\nas possible metamorphic equivalents to flow tops (Fig. 3i). \n\nPetrochemical characteristics of the komatiitic flows \n\nThe komatiitic lavas in the Guariroba-Peroba greenstone segment are represented by typical \n\nkomatiites (18-25 wt% MgO) with subordinate cumulates (34 wt% MgO) and komatiitic \n\nbasalts (10-15 wt% MgO). They show a differentiation trend similar to other archean \n\nkomatiitic flows (Fig. 7a, b). Some samples display local drift to the CaO side as shown in \n\nfigure 7a. Due to the high amphibolite facies metamorphism, intense weathering, deformation \n\nand shearing, volcanic textures such as spinifex, pillow lavas and flow tops are normally \n\nabsent. With the escavations for the construction of the Ni plant site several exposures of \n\nspinifex texture and pillow lava were shown north of the nickel deposit (Fig. 3b). However, \n\nthe outcrops are scarse and preclude any reconstruction of the entire flow structure. Most borehole \n\ncores show recristalized fine to medium grained foliated rocks. The fractionated deposit rocks \n\nhave a distinctive massive texture and, regardless the intense drilling carried out in the mine area, \n\nthey do not show spinifex textures. Chemical data show a marked switch towards the CaO side in \n\nthe MgO-CaO-Al2O3 ternary diagram with a bended differentiation trend (Fig. 7a). The Fortaleza \n\nde Minas trend is similar to the Barbeton trend (Viljoen et al, 1982; Viljoen and Viljoen, 1982), \n\nrather than the Western Australian komatiites behaviour (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Hill, 2001). \n\n \n\nFig. 7.

Fractionation trends for the Fortaleza de Minas highly fractionated flow. \n \n \nThe fractionated flow gabbro zone may plot partially out of the original limit between \n\nkomatiitic and tholeitic basalts as defined by Jensen (1976) for the Jensen cation plot. Viljoen \n\net al (1982) proposed a revision of Jensen limits for the Barbeton komatiites (Fig, 9). The data \n\nfits better to the limits proposed by Viljoen as it moves towards the field of tholeitic high Mg \n\nbasalts. The proposed limit for komatiites and komatiitic basalts falls within the pyroxene-\n\ncumulate zone. The observed boundaries for the fractionated flow is shown as a dotted line. \n\nThe higher dispersion of the data for the gabbro zone can be related to modifications of \n\noriginal composition during metamorphism. However, for the olivine-cumulate zone - where \n\nprocesses of retrograde metamorphism with high CO2 pressure formed talc-carbonate rocks \n\nafter serpentinites derived from primary olivine-cumulates - the dispersion of the data is \n\nconsidered to be negletable even considering the high amount of volatiles in the serpentinite \n\n(SS) and talc-carbonate schist (TT) (average 11% (SS) and 13% (TT), maximum 21% (SS) \n\nand 23% (TT)). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 70 \n\n \n \nFig. 9.

Solid lines after Viljoen (1982) revision of original \nJensen limits for Barbeton greenstone flows. Dotted lines represent natural breaks for Fortaleza de \nMinas flow fractioning. \n \n \nDue to metamorphism and shearing no olivine and cromite were preserved. The olivine \n\ncumulates have been completely transformed into serpentinites and talc carbonate rocks. The \n\nestimation of the original bulk composition was inferred from the proportions and average \n\nMgO contents of each fractionated zone of the flow. From a comprehensive borehole database \n\nthe weighted average bulk MgO content was estimated, ranging between 18 and 23 wt% MgO \n\n(Appendix 1).  \n\nGeological model for volcanogenic komatiitic related Ni - Fe sulfide deposits \n\nThe most accepted model today for this type of mineralization is well documented in many \n\nrecent papers (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Lesher, 1989; Hill, 2001; Hill et al, 2004; Barnes et \n\nal, 2004; and Nadrett, 2005) and is related to assimilation of sulfides by thermal erosion \n\nprocesses in channelized komatiite flows. The different volcanic environment show \n\ndistinctive features as function of the proximity to the feeder area for the lava flows. Lesher \n\nand Keays (2002) and Hill (2001) classified the komatiite related sulfide deposits into \n\ndifferent types regarding their volcanic setting. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit shows \n\ncharacteristics of a Type 1 mineralization of distal facies with a shallow thermal erosion \n\ntrough in a thick highly fractionated flow. The major characteristics of Type 1 deposits \n\ndescribed in Lesher and Keays (2002) are the presence of a basal massive sulfide followed by \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 71 \n\nmatrix and disseminated ores in an ortho-cumulate thick zone associated with a trough or \n\nchannel formed by thermal erosion (fig. 10).  \n\n \n \nFig. 10. Komatiite volcanic facies. a diagram showing a typical komatiitic flow field with facies and \nrelated deposits after Hill, 2001 and Lesher and Keays 2002. b diagramatic cross-section showing \nType 1 sulfide mineralization of the Silver Lake Member of the Kambalda Komatiite Formation after \nCowden and Roberts 1990 in Hill 2001. c schematic cross-section illustrating  the formation of Type 1 \nNi deposit through thermal-mechanical erosion of sulfidic sediments after Hill 2001. \n \n \nMost of the Type 1 deposit flows show indications of local contamination processes related to \n\nthermomechanical erosion of Sulfur-rich rocks beneath lava channels (Lesher and Keays, \n\n2002; Lesher and Arndt, 1995). Indications of crustal contamination such as enrichment in \n\nlight rare-earth elements (Fig. 11) can be found in many komatiite lava flowing conduits by \n\nthermomechanical erosion and assimilation of felsic tuffs and banded iron formations. \n\nExtensive sulfide/ oxide bearing banded iron formations in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit \n\narea are interpreted as the major source for crustal contamination. Sulfur isotopes and S/Se \n\nratios (Choudhuri et al., 1997) and Re-Os isotopes (Correia et al., 2001) from the Fortaleza de \n\nMinas deposit show similar values from other komatiite hosted type 1 deposits. Although the \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 72 \n\nabove mentioned authors argued against thermomechanical erosion, we agree with Lesher &amp; \n\nKeays, (2002) that the best interpretation of the S and S/Se variations in Type 1 deposits is in \n\nfavour of assimilation of crustal metasedimentary rocks. S/Se ratios (4810-17540) from the \n\nFortaleza de Minas ores are higher than the mantle value and, like other Type 1 ores, are \n\nconsistent with the interpretation that most of the S in the ores has been derived from \n\nassimilation of sulfidic sediments (Lesher &amp; Keays, 2002). The high Os initial ratio and ?Os \n\nvalues in the Fortaleza de Minas ores is interpreted herein as related to crustal assimilation \n\nand not to metamorphic and remobilization processes as suggested by Correia et al., (2001). \n\nLesher and Keays, (2002) pointed out that the observed Os isotopic compositions can be \n\nattributed to variations in the R factor, resulting from mixing of highly radiogenic crustally-\n\nderived Os with less radiogenic mantled-derived Os. \n\n \nFig. 11.

The \u201cThick fractionated flow units\u201d are up to 150 m thick and several km wide and are \n\ncharacterized by in situ differentiation of ponded komatiite lava containing pyroxenitic and \n\ngabbroic cumulates in lava lakes. Commonly the lower part of these units are occupied by \n\nhomogeneous olivine orthocumulates and meso cumulates assumed to be formed during an \n\nearly flow-trough stage in a lava channel, which subsequently became dammed up.  A typical  \n\nexample of this type of flow being Fred`s flow at Munro Township (Arndt et al., 1973). The \n\nFortaleza de Minas highly fractionated flow units has similar thickness and widths (fig. 6) and \n\nalso similar fractionation products \u2013 olivine-orthocumulate, pyroxene-cumulate and gabbro - \n\nand is considered to be formed in a ponded lava lake facies environment similar to Munro \n\nFred\u2019s flow (fig. 10).  Figure 12 shows a schematic cross-sections illustrating the volcanic \n\nstructures and lithologies of type 1 (Fig. 12a) and type 2 (Fig. 12b) deposits, after Hill, (2001), \n\nand the schematic diagram proposed for the Fortaleza de Minas ponded type 1 mineralization \n\n(Fig. 12c). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 74 \n\n \nFig. 12.

They are typically banded \n\ncherts and hematite bearing banded iron formation with thin komatiitic inter-sediment \n\nflows. In the central portion of the Guariroba-Peroba segment the komatiites and \n\nkomatiitic basalt flows are often separated by thin cherty black shale horizons, banded \n\ncherty graphitic meta-tuffs and sulfide facies banded iron formations. Laterally they \n\ngradually merge to oxide facies magnetite bearing BIFs. Pyrrhotite is the dominant sulfide \n\nfollowed by chalcopyrite, sphalerite and arsenopyrite. The same carbonaceous banded iron \n\nformation and tuffs also occur in the SW portion of the segment as interflow sediments in \n\nthe upper and lower sequences from Brenner et al, (1990). The Fortaleza de Minas \n\nfractionated flow (formerly intermediate sequence) has distinctive oxide and silicate facies \n\nBIF horizons within the individual fractionated flow units. The lower flow units are \n\nseparated by thin (0.5 to 5m) horizons of oxide facies with a tremolitic/ actinolitic \n\ngroundmass finelly or coarsely banded with magnetite layers where free silica is absent or \n\nrare (Figs. 3h and 5). The interflow sediment horizon that separates the ore bearing upper \n\nflow unit to the lower ones is abnormally thick (up to 50m) and starts with a silica rich \n\noxide facies BIF (with fine magnetite bands) evolving to a silicate facies with banded \n\ncummingtonite, actinolite and silica displaying banded disseminated sulfides towards the \n\ntop. The width of this horizon becomes very narrow and eventually discontinues in the \n\ncentral part of both openpit and underground mines along a steep plunge and has been \n\ninterpreted as due to thermal erosion processes along a lava flow channel (Fig. 12c). In the \n\nSW limb of the Fortaleza de Minas Syncline some of the lower BIF horizons show \n\ngradational contacts to graphitic banded iron formations and cherty-tuffs indicating a \n\nchange to deeper water environment. The facies distribution suggests a shallow water \n\nenvironment for the fractionated flow changing laterally to deeper water environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 76 \n\nEmbayment and Trough structures \n\n \n\nSimilarly to other komatiite volcanic Type 1 Nickel deposits (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Hill, \n\n2001; Beresford, 2005) the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is also related to trough or embayment \n\nstructures. Evidences for such structures are: \n\n \n\n- The presence of high MgO ortho-cummulates (B zone) and the absence of spinifex \n\nzones (A). (Not applicable for the Fortaleza de Minas highly fractionated flow). \n\n- Presence of cumulate and massive textures in highly fractionated flows. \n\n- Lateral changes to thinner sequences with spinifex textures. \n\n- Evidences of thermal erosion (lack of footwall BIF). \n\n- Presence of massive, matrix and disseminated ores in these troughs. (Massive ore has \n\nbeen recristalized and remobilized as breccia ore prograding the trough limits at \n\nFortaleza de Minas).  \n\n \n\nAlthough the deposit has been affected by intense folding and shearing indications of trough \n\nstructures can still be recognized. Figures 13 and 14 show trough structures with primary \n\ndisseminated and matrix ores associated with thinning of the footwall BIF interpreted as \n\ncaused by thermal erosion. The intense shear associated with the sinistral transcurrent faults \n\nthat affected the deposit and the greenstone belt segment as a whole promoted a strong \n\nflattening of the rocks in the mine area where the flattening effect seems to have been much \n\nmore intense than the horizontal displacement along the ore contact fault (Rosas, 2003; \n\nBrenner et al, 2006 \u2013 in press). Figure 15 shows the 900m sublevel where up to five \n\nindividual flow units can be outlined. The deposit is hosted by the upper V flow unit. Despite \n\nthe strong shearing, the trough zone is clearly defined by the presence of disseminated and \n\nmatrix ore types and the sudden pinch of the footwall BIF. Figure 16a show the 990m bench \n\nfrom the open pit mine and a simplified reconstruction of the overall shape of the embayment \n\nstructure in the central portion of the deposit prior to deformation by shortening the 990m \n\nbench plan view by 7 times (Fig. 16b). The trough is indicated by both the thinning and lack \n\nof the footwall BIF and the presence of disseminated and matrix ores. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 77 \n\n \nFig. 13.

Widespread \ndistribution of Breccia ore (BR) and restrict occurrence of primary Matrix ore (MX) associated with \nrapid thinning of footwall BIF (BF). Four highly fractionated flows can be identified facing upwards \nand separated by thin but continuous horizons of Banded Iron Formation with clear facies change from \noxide (BFo) to silicate (BFs) and graphitic sulfide facies (BFg) indicating change from shallow to \ndeep water environment to the top. Each flow has a distinctive olivine-cumulate basal zone (now \nrepresented by serpentinite \u2013 SS and talc schist \u2013 TT), followed by an intermediate pyroxene-cumulate \n(PI) and an upper gabbro zone (AT). Concentrated shearing in the footwall side of the ore zone has \npromoted pinching and stretching of the olivine-cumulates in the footwall flows followed by \nincomplete talcification of serpentinites leaving remaining nuclei in the thicker zones.  \n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 78 \n\n \nFig. 14. 700 sublevel plan showing trough structure with Disseminated (DS), Matrix (MX) and \nBreccia (BR) ores and thermal erosion of the footwall BIF.

The \nolivine-cumulate zone (serpentinites) is also locally thicker over the embayment, although this could \nbe also caused by large scale pinch and swell along the major shear zone. \n \n \nA vertical longitudinal section including both open pit and underground mine also reveals \n\nclearly the trough structure where two interpreted separate troughs open apart at depth (Fig. \n\n17). The troughs are revealed by the outlines of both disseminated and matrix ores and also, \n\nindirectly, by the lack of remobilized ore in the footwall BIF as a consequence of thermal \n\nerosion of the banded iron formation. The trough structures also coincide with higher ore \n\nwidths and higher average Ni grades. Major displacements are tentatively interpreted as \n\nresulting from primary faults that could have controlled the trough structures and \n\nconsequently the ore distribution. It is difficult to confirm that these structures were not \n\nsettled much later during folding and shearing, however, minor faults and shears observed at \n\nunderground exposures do not seem to relate to these major structures. \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 80 \n\n \nFig. 17.

Barnes &amp; Brand (1999) looked at \n\nkomatiites Ni and Cr data from a compreensive literature review.  Although roughly 75 \n\npercent of the data fall in a low Cr low Ni cluster of less than 4.000 ppm, -the \u201colivine-\n\nliquid field\u201d-, they observed that barren and mineralized komatiite sequences show \n\ncontrasting trends on plots of Cr versus Ni (Fig. 18). A high Ni low Cr \u2018mineralized field` \n\ncomposed of sulfide bearing samples, with low Cr values, is strongly associated with lava \n\npathways. Channelized and related thin flows are systematically depleted in cromite as \n\nchannelized flow environments are dominated by more primitive magmas usually not \n\nsaturated in cromite.

The strong association of the barren and mineralized fields to \n\nvolcanic facies indicated that ponded sheet flow and lava lake sequences would be of \n\nlow potential for economic Ni deposits in contrast with the more prospective sequences \n\nfrom channelized flow facies (Hill, 2001, Barnes &amp; Brand, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas mineralized flow has a typical high Cr \u2018lava lake` signature. \n\nEven the higher Ni samples, towards the disseminated ore type, have high Cr values \n\n(Fig. 18b). The Guariroba \u2013 Peroba komatiite barren sheet flow samples fall mostly in \n\nthe low Cr low Ni \u2018olivine-liquid field` cluster. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit as a \n\nponded flow facies does not support the low potential of lava lake sequences as an \n\nexploratory geochemical tool. In the same way, the Cr versus MgO plot reveals that the \n\nFortaleza de Minas flow has a high Cr/MgO signature (Fig. 18c), in contrast with many \n\nkomatiite hosted Ni deposits from Western Australia where a low Cr high MgO \n\nmineralized trend associated with channelized high MgO cumulates has been reffered to \n\nas the \u201cKambalda trend\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\nProgressive fractioning of olivine from barren komatiite lava depletes the lava in Ni \n\nresulting in a linear positive correlation of Ni with MgO. In dynamic extrusive systems \n\nthe overall level of Ni depletion is usually low and high levels of Ni depletion in host \n\nlavas are a positive sign for exploration, although little or no Ni depletion may not be a \n\nnegative sign (Hill, 2001). Figure 18d shows that no signifficant Ni depletion is \n\nobserved in the Fortaleza de Minas ore host flow, and there is no discriminating Ni \n\nversus MgO signature for the mineralized flow when compared with the barren sheet \n\nflows from the Guariroba \u2013 Peroba area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 82 \n\n \nFig. 18.

Black outlines in plots c-d show \ndata density contour enclosing 90% of literature data on Al-undepleted komatiites from Archean \nterrains, after Barnes, Hill and Evans, 2004. \n \n\nDiscussion \n\n \n\nThe thick fractionated ore host flow shows remarkable differences to the typical komatiite \n\nrelated type 1 and type 2 deposits described in Western Australia and seems to have been \n\nformed in a large pond or lava lake oscilating from shallow to deep water environment \n\nprobably at the distal portions of a lava channel (Fig. 10). Most deposits display a thick ortho-\n\ncumulate or adcumulate channelized flows with lateral thinning and development of olivine or \n\npyroxene spinifex top zones. Most of these channelized flows are poorly fractioned. Well \n\npreserved lava channels associated to both type 1 and type 2 deposits have been recently \n\ndescribed in the Black Swan area, Western Australia (Hill et al, 2004; Barnes et al, 2004; \n\nDowling et al, 2004), and has also been identified in many komatiite hosted deposits \n\n(Kawahikawa et al, 1998; Barnes et al, 1998; Dowling et al, 2002; Lesher &amp; Keays, 2002; \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 83 \n\nBeresford, 2005; Stone, 2005). Although the ore formation is essencially related with very \n\nsimilar ore types, the Fortaleza de Minas flow shows a significantly different environment \n\nof ore formation.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSimilar highly fractionated flows are also found in Munro, Township where two thick \n\nfractionated flows occur in the same area, one komatiitic (Fred\u2019s Flow) and the other \n\ntholeitic (Theo\u2019s Flow) (Arndt, 1977; Arndt et al., 1977). They both display equivalent \n\nfractioned products ranging from olivine-cumulates to pyroxene-cumulates and gabbro. \n\nThe major differences between them are shown in figures 19 a-b. Same chemical profiles \n\nwere provided for the Fortaleza de Minas fractioned flow from selected drill holes (Fig. \n\n19c). Although the amount of pyroxene-cumulate is close to the tholeitic flow, the MgO \n\nfractionation trend is even closer to the komatiitic Fred\u2019s Flow. The MgO profile from \n\nFortaleza de Minas shows a fractionation trend similar to the komatiitic flow for the \n\nolivine-cumulate. Due to metamorphism and strong shearing most of the original textures \n\nand magmatic mineralogy has been obliterated. The fine-grained zone at the top of the \n\ngabbro unit is tentatively correlated to the flow top units. The possible metamorphic \n\nequivalent of flow tops observed in cores is more likely to be derived from aphanitic \n\npyroxenite than to spinifex. Interpreted flow tops are quite thin and were not sampled. The \n\ndrop in MgO trend at the border zone (base of flow) is similar to the komatiitic Fred\u2019s \n\nflow. Fractionated trends from the deposit lower flow units are analogous to those of the \n\nuppermost mineralized flow unit. The different flow units are always separated by thin to \n\nthick horizons of chemical sediments (BIF) and also show equivalent differentiation trend \n\nin the western limb of the syncline. They are considered all together as part of a thick \n\nhighly fractionated flow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 84 \n\n \nFig. 19.

Besides the absence of spinifex textures, the \ntholeitic profile display a much thicker pyroxene cumulate zone than the komatiitic profile. The thick \npyroxene cumulate zone at Fortaleza de Minas display similarities with the tholeitic flow. The \nproportion of olivine cumulate at Fortaleza is somewhere in between the two types of flow at Munro. \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 85 \n\nFigure 20 shows the whole rock composition of Fred\u2019s and Theo\u2019s flows from Munro and \n\ntheir distinctive fractionation trends, and the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow for \n\ncomparison.

The \n\nTiO2 content indicates a good fit to the komatiitic field from Munro Township. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 86 \n\n \nFig. 21.

Plot of major compositional fields for komatiites from \nMunro Township and picrites from different ages and environments.  \n \n\nIn Type 1 deposits the massive/ matrix ore hanging wall rock is typically an olivine-cumulate \n\nthat occupied the lava pathway after the settling of the Ni sulfide orebody, being also \n\nchemically distinctive (Hill, 2001; Lesher and Keays, 2002). But at Fortaleza de Minas, in a \n\nlava lake environment, indications are that the deposit host is intimately related to the Ni \n\nmineralisation and there is a continuous transition of both Ni grades and sulfide content from \n\nthe barren host to disseminated ore and from this to matrix ore. The ponded environment \n\nsuported the high degree of fractionation and the settling of disseminated, matrix and massive \n\nores along an open trough, possibly at the end of a lava channel in a shallow lava lake. The \n\nhigh Cr and the lack of Ni depletion pointed out by Oostindier et al., (1990) and the \n\nstratigraphic argument against crustal assimilation (Choudhuri et al., 1997) should be \n\nreviewed considering the distal ponded environment for this deposit, where many evidences \n\npoints towards crustal assimilation related to thermo-mechanical erosion. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas deposit can be described as a Ni \u2013 Fe sulfide mineralization of Type 1 \n\nassociated with komatiite flows (Lesher and Keays, 2002). The mineralization occur at an \n\ninner top zone of a thick highly fractionated flow, which has a very distinctive fractionation \n\npattern and is distinctive from most of the typical Type 1 deposit hosts. Instead of being \n\nhosted by a typical ortho-cumulate with associated spinifex textured komatiites the Fortaleza \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 87 \n\nde Minas deposit is associated with an olivine-cumulate, pyroxene-cumulate and gabbro. The \n\nhigh fractionation pattern observed troughout the thick flow suggests a lava pond or lava lake \n\nenvironment. The original composition of the magma is inferred to be positioned at the lower \n\nlimit of typical komatiites, and can be classified as a pyroxenitic komatiite or a transitional \n\ntype, encompassing komatiitic and basaltic komatiite composition. The pyroxenitic \n\ncomposition (tremolite \u2013 chlorite) of the fine grained flow top reinforces that conclusion. \n\n \n\nKomatiite hosted deposits are not common in ponded flow facies or lava lakes and this has \n\nbeen reinforced in the literature by the \u2018barren` Cr versus Ni signature of lava lake \n\nenvironment. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit has a distinctive high Cr prospective chemical \n\nsignature and also a distinctive ponded facies volcanic environment with aplication in the \n\nconstruction of a new exploratory model for this type of deposit (high Cr and lack of Ni \n\ndepletion in highly fractionated flows, associated with open embayments). In this sense lava \n\nlakes can not be excluded as a favourable environment for Ni deposits and must be \n\nreassesed worldwide. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors are grateful for all the support given by the State University of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 \n\nUNESP \u2013 Rio Claro Campus and the long living partnership between the University and the \n\nmine staff which led to better understanding this unique deposit. \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX 1 - Estimation of bulk MgO composition of the fractionated flow \n\n \n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow has been intensely sheared and metamorphosed and \n\ntherefore the olivine cumulates have been completely transformed into serpentinites and talc \n\ncarbonate rocks. No original olivine and cromite has ever been detected so far in both open pit \n\nand underground mine samples or cores. The estimation of the original bulk composition must \n\nthen be inferred from the proportions and average MgO contents of each fractionated zone of \n\nthe flow. From the borehole database a total of 182 individual flow intersections were \n\ninvestigated. The true width of each flow was calculated along with true widths for the \n\ngabbro, pyroxene-cumulate and olivine-cumulate zones. The individual flows were classified \n\ninto lower, intermediate and upper flow units for the SW and NE limbs of the Fortaleza de \n\nMinas Syncline. The NE limb being the mine limb and the upper flow unit the mineralized \n\n\n\nThe Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 88 \n\nflow unit. The proportion of each fractionated unit was then calculated for each flow with the \n\ncaution to minimize the effect of shearing which can be responsible for pinching out and \n\nthinning of individual units. This is particularly true for the base of the upper flow and the top \n\nof the intermediate flow in the mine NE limb. To estimate the correct proportions of primary \n\nfractionated units we should look for the less deformed zones of the flows, that is where the \n\nflows should have the fully preserved fractioned sequence. For that purpose it was considered \n\na minimum width of 5m for each unit for average width calculation. The results are tabulated \n\nin table 5 for the major flow units for both SW and NE limbs of the Fortaleza de Minas \n\nSyncline. The average bulk MgO content was calculated weighting the proportion of each unit \n\nby its average MgO content. The data suggests that the original komatiitic magma of the \n\nFortaleza de Minas flow should have a bulk MgO content between 18 and 23 wt% MgO. \n\nTable 5 indicates that the lower flows in the two limbs display the higher MgO content (22 \n\nwt%), followed by the intermediate flows (20 to 23 wt% MgO). The mineralized flow show \n\nlower MgO content (18 to 19 wt%) than the previous flow units. One interpretation for this \n\ngradual change in composition could be related to magma contamination by assimilation of \n\nlower MgO units. The intense deformation and shearing observed in the area severely \n\nimpacted on the original distribution of the fractionated units. Although this effect was \n\ntentatively minimized by filtering the data set it is not guaranteed that this proportion is fully \n\nreliable. However the upward MgO decreasing trend in both limbs are consistent and may \n\nwell reflect magmatic contamination. \n\n \n\nTable 5.
