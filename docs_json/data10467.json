INTRODUCTION \n \n\nThe ability and extent of waves on quarrying the \ncliff foot depends on the structure connecting the \ncliff with the sea floor (shore platform or sandy \nbeach). Medium-term (centennial) cliff retreat has \nbeen reported as mainly controlled by the shore \nplatform morphology on the cliff foot as well as by \nhydrodynamic processes acting on it (Duperret et al., \n2005; Walkden and Hall, 2005; Pierre, 2006; \nMcGlashan et al., 2008). The widen of the shore \nplatform driven by several processes including the \ncliff retreat, leads to the successively topographic \nelevation of the cliff-platform junction and to wave \nenergy dissipation, and therefore to the decrease of \nthe recession rate through a negative feedback \n(McGlashan et al., 2008). Where beaches develop at \nthe cliff toe, the coastal equilibrium correlates \npositively with beach width, which responds very \nrapidly to changes on waves and tides characteristics \n(Morisawa and King, 1974). The ongoing research \nproject named Erosion of Rocky Shores-differences \nin protection promoted by sandy beaches and shore \nplatforms (EROS) aims, among other objectives: (i) \nto quantify the amount of the wave energy \ndissipation upon both shore platforms and sandy \nbeaches; (ii) to characterize the wave and current \nfields and its dependency on the local beach \nmorphology. Two study sites differently exposed to \nthe incident waves are considered. This work \n\npresents the results of a field experiment, which led \nto the proposal of the EROS project. The data were \ncollected in December 2009.  Furthermore, two \nrecent field campaigns made during March 2012 are \nalso described.  \n \n\n2.  STUDY AREA \n \n\nThe coastal zone of the centre Algarve between Gal\u00e9 \nand Olhos de \u00c1gua (Fig.1) displays a complex \nkarstic morphology leading to a strong \nmorphological control of the hydrodynamic \nprocesses. Cliffs exposing near horizontal carbonate \nrocks back both shore platforms and beaches. \nSandstones filling the palaeo relief into the \ncarbonate rocks may reach the rocky cliffs \nlowermost portions. This crenulated shore with \npocket beaches bounded by headlands and shore \nplatforms, offers suitable conditions as a case study. \nIt enables to quantify and compare the behaviour of \nwaves and currents over both shore platforms and \nthe adjacent beaches during the same time span and \noffshore conditions, but with different obliquity \nwhen approaching the coast. The waves incoming \nfrom WSW represent 72% of the year. Off the \nAlgarve, the wave height ranges from 0.30 m to 1.8 \nm, with rare exceptional heights surpassing 3.7 m. \nSuch high waves are usually associated with storms \nfrom the SW sector, during which waves attain an \naveraged height of 2-3 m with a period of 7-8 s \n\n\n\n2as Jornadas de Engenharia Hidrogr\u00e1fica                                                                     Lisboa, 20-22 de junho de 2012   \n\n(Costa et al., 2001). The Algarve coast experiences a \nsemi-diurnal mesotidal regime ranging from 2.70 to \n1.36 m during neap tides and from 3.82 to 0.64 m \nduring spring tides (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, IH, \n1990). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1. Location of the study area.  \n\n \n3. FIELD CAMPAINGN DECEMBER 2009  \n \n3.1- Methods \n\nFour pressure transducers (pt) were used in order to \nsimultaneously acquire the wave heights (H) and \nperiods (T) crossing two shore platforms at different \nangles to the incident waves. Thus, two pressure \ntransducers were used in Gal\u00e9 (pt1 and pt2, Fig. 2A) \nand the other two in Olhos de \u00c1gua (pt3 and pt4, \nFig. 2B). The seaward transducers (pt1 at Gal\u00e9 and \npt3 at Olhos de \u00c1gua) were positioned in the lower \nintertidal zone at the spring low tide level, whereas \nthe landward pt2 and pt4 at Gal\u00e9 and Olhos de \u00c1gua \nrespectively were placed close to the cliff foot (Fig. \n2). The height above mean sea level and \ngeographical position were taken using a differential \ngeographical position system (dGPS). The pt sensors \nwere protected with stainless steel cages to prevent \nboth the algae accumulation upon the sensors and \nthe damage by gravel transported by waves. \n \n3.2- Results and discussion \n \nChanges in the direction of propagation due to \nvariations in the group velocity may result in the \nincreasing of wave heights when approaching the \ncoast. During the monitored tidal cycle, the offshore \nwave direction was 247\u00ba and the offshore significant \nheight (Hs0) was 0.9 m (IH data, Faro buoy). \nAccording to the coastline orientation, the waves \napproached the shoreline obliquely with angles of \nincidence of 65\u00ba and 25\u00ba at Gal\u00e9 and Olhos de \u00c1gua \nrespectively. The deep-water waves shoal at the \nGal\u00e9 outer edge (pt1) show a statistically significant \nincrease (P<0.05) of the significant wave height (Hs) \nof 43%. In a sheltered position to the WSW waves, \nthe Hs at the shore platform outer edge (pt3) at \nOlhos de \u00c1gua, was 41% lower than Hs0 but that Hs \ndecrease was not statistically significant (P>0.05). \nThis difference may be explained both by the \nrelationship between the bathymetric contours and \nthe waves direction and the bottom morphology \n(e.g., Davidson-Arnott, 2010). The inner continental \nshelf shows a steeper morphology at Gal\u00e9 and waves \nfrom WSW are less oblique to the coastline than in \nOlhos de \u00c1gua.  \n\nThe water depth on the platform changes with the \ntide being the main factor controlling the changes of \nthe wave height. The highest Hs was observed four \nhours after the beginning of flood at the outer \npressure transducers, and two and one hour later at \nthe inner ones at Gal\u00e9 and Olhos de \u00c1gua \nrespectively (Fig. 3). The Hs modification along the \nshore platform was noted worthy different between \nthe studied sites (Fig. 3).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n\nFig. 2. Shore platforms and pressure transducers at A) \nGal\u00e9 and B) Olhos de \u00c1gua. The accuracy of images and \nprofiles are quite different because at Olhos de \u00c1gua they \nwere produced through a laser scan survey whereas a \ndGPS survey was used at Gal\u00e9. Elevations report to mean \nsea level. \n \n \nThe averaged wave Hs was 1.18 m at the outer pt in \nGal\u00e9 decreasing along the platform to 0.78 m as \nregistered in the landward pt (pt2) close to the cliff \nfoot, representing a statistically extremely \nsignificance (P<0.001) decreasing of 33%.  The ratio \nbetween Hs and the water depth (Hs/h) ranged \nlandward from 0.83 (SD=0.27) to 0.74 (SD = 0.10). \nConsidering these thresholds and the Hs values in \npt1, 65% of the waves broke before reaching the \ninner position at pt2.

The wave power \nat breaking (Pb) in the shore platform outer edge \n(pt1) was 10819 Kw/m at Gal\u00e9 decreasing to more \nthan half (4915 Kw/m) near the cliff foot at pt2.  \nIn contrast to Gal\u00e9, Hs increased from 0.53 to 0.68 \nm between the platform outer edge (pt3) and the \nlandward pt (pt4) near the cliff foot at Olhos de \n\u00c1gua. However, the observed 28% of Hs increasing \nbetween pt3 and pt4 was not statistically significant \n(P>0.05). Thereby, the sheltered (to WSW waves) \nand flatter shore platform at Olhos de \u00c1gua did not \nshow the effectiveness on dissipating the energy of \nthe waves as observed at Gal\u00e9. The Hs/h value of 0.6 \nwas quite constant along the shore platform \ntraducing it relative flatness with respect to the Gal\u00e9 \nsite. Similarly to Gal\u00e9, 64% of the incoming waves \nbroke before attaining the inner portion of the \nplatform. However, the remaining 36% of the waves \nshoaling along the platform represented a landward \nincreasing of the Pb from 2165 Kw/m in pt3 to 3750 \nKw/m pt4 close the cliff foot. \nThose results show that, together with the tidal \nelevation, the platform slope has a major role on the \nwave energy dissipation as also observed by other \nauthors (Marshall and Stephenson, 2011; Ogawa et \nal., 2011).  \n \n4. FIELD CAMPAINGNS MARCH 2012 \n \nAiming to further quantify the amount of the wave \nenergy dissipation upon shore platforms and sandy \nbeaches, two field campaigns were recently \nperformed (March, 8 and 22). We deployed \nelectromagnetic current meters (ecm, Infinity) and \npressure transducers (pt, In Situ Level Troll 700) in \nnormal transepts to the shoreline both in shore \nplatform and beach (Fig. 4). Permanent fixings have \nbeen made into the rock in shore platforms using \nbolts and chemical dowels in order to locate the pt \nand ecm equipments. The near shore wave climate \n(currents and waves) was obtained through an \nacoustic doppler current meter (adp, Sonteck, Mini \nADP 1.5 MHz) anchored at the 8 m bathymetric \ncontour. The frequency of data acquisition was 2 Hz \nfor pt and 4Hz for adp and ecm. A cell size of 0.25 \nm and an averaging interval of 10 min with profiling \ninterval of 5 min, that represents a 4 min of wave \nmeasurement, were adopted for the adp data \nacquisition. The experiences were performed during \ntwo tidal cycles, with simultaneous data acquisition \nin the shore platform and the adjacent beach, at Gal\u00e9 \nand Olhos de \u00c1gua sites (Fig. 4). The present data \nset will be analysed in the scope of EROS project to \ngive further insight of the waves dissipation both in \nthe platform and beach at both study sites. \n \n \n \n\n5. FINAL REMARKS AND FURTHER \nWORK \n\n \nThe role of shore platform in dissipating the wave \nenergy is largely dependent of the coastal sector \norientation and the platform slope. For the same \noffshore wave conditions, we observed that:  \n1- The waves shoaling at the steeper shelf adjacent \nto the well exposed site of Gal\u00e9 represented 63% of \nthe Hs increase with respect to the offshore Hs0, \nwhereas the Hs increase at Olhos de \u00c1gua, where \nthe waves approached with a high obliquity, was not \nstatistically significant; \n2- The shore platform at Gal\u00e9 was more efficient in \nenergy dissipation than at the Olhos de \u00c1gua \nsheltered site, where both the inner continental shelf \nand the shore platform are flatter; \n3- Hs/h ranged landward between 0.83 and 0.74 at \nGal\u00e9 and showed a constant value of 0.6 across the \nplatform at Olhos de \u00c1gua. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.3.
