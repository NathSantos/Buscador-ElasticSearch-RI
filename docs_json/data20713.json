The first volcanic \nepisode, grouped in the high-Ti rhyolites from the Tupanci hill, \nshows age of 579 \u00b1 5.6 Ma, which is in agreement with the post-colli-\nsional Acampamento Velho Formation volcanism in the\u00a0Bom Jardim \nGroup of the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin. A poorly constrained age of 558\u00a0+/- \n39\u00a0Ma was obtained for rhyolites from the low-Ti group at the Pica-\ndos Hill, which may indicate a younger acid volcanism, or a greater \ntime span for the volcanism of the Acampamento Velho Formation in \nsouthernmost Brazil. Regarding magmatic sources, Sm/Nd isotopic \ndata coupled to Pb isotopes and a review of trace element geochem-\nistry indicate different amounts of Paleoproterozoic (Dom\u00a0Feliciano, \nPinheiro Machado Suite) to Neoproterozoic (Rio Vacaca\u00ed terrane) \nlower crust melting. Our data, coupled with literature data, contrib-\nute to a better understanding of the stratigraphic evolution for the \nNeoproterozoic post-collisional volcanic successions of the Camaqu\u00e3 \nBasin in the Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield.\nKEYWORDS: Volcanism; Acampamento Velho Formation; \nCamaqu\u00e3 Basin; Tupanci; Geochronology.\n\nRESUMO:\u00a0Novas idades obtidas por meio do m\u00e9todo U-Pb em zirc\u00e3o e \ndados isot\u00f3picos Sm-Nd-Pb s\u00e3o apresentados para as rochas vulc\u00e2nicas e hi-\npabssais \u00e1cidas da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o mais setentrional da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Acampamento \nVelho na por\u00e7\u00e3o NW do Escudo Sul-Rio-Grandense, Brasil.

The\u00a0magmatism in this era was \ndeveloped in two main phases: arc-related environment, \nwith\u00a0ages from 850\u2013700\u00a0Ma; and post-collisional environ-\nment (Li\u00e9geois 1998), with ages from 650\u2013535\u00a0Ma, marked \nby magmatism along transcurrent shear zones (Fernandes \net\u00a0al. 1995, Babinski et\u00a0al. 1997, Bitencourt &amp; Nardi 2000, \nChemale Jr. 2000, Hartmann et\u00a0al. 2000, 2007, Nardi &amp; \nBitencourt 2009). \n\nThe post-collisional stage in the eastern portion of the \nSRGS is marked by a shear belt with voluminous granitic \nmagmatism in the Pelotas Batholith (Philipp et\u00a0al. 2000). \nGeneral aspects of this extensive granite production episode \nin the Pelotas Batholith include syn-transcurrent, high-K, \ncalc-alkaline and peraluminous granites that evolve to sho-\nshonitic affinity and late to post-transcurrent, dominantly \n\nmetaluminous alkaline granites (Philipp &amp; Machado 2005). \nExcluding the leucocratic peraluminous granites, all granitoid \ntypes have basic magmatic rocks associated, normally repre-\nsented by mafic microgranular enclaves and dykes in com-\nmingling systems (Bitencourt &amp; Nardi 2000). Western and \nnorthwestern portions of the SRGS represent less deformed \nareas, with volcano-sedimentary sequences associated with \nthe Camaqu\u00e3 Basin (Fig. 1). Magmatism in the W and NW \nportion of the SRGS developed mainly between 650\u2013530\u00a0Ma \nand shares a similar geochemical evolution as observed in \nthe eastern part of the SRGS, with the presence of high-K, \ncalc-alkaline granitoids, shoshonitic and tholeitic pluto-\nno-volcanic sequences (Nardi et\u00a0al. 2008). The\u00a0sedimen-\ntary sequences in the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin evolve from shallow \nmarine in the Maric\u00e1 Formation to lacustrine and alluvial \nin the Bom Jardim and Camaqu\u00e3 groups (Paim et\u00a0al. 2000).\n\nMagmatism in the Bom Jardim Group is related to the \nLavras do Sul Shoshonitic Association, which is plutonic \nand volcanic basic to acid rocks mainly with ages between \n610\u2013590\u00a0 Ma (Lima &amp; Nardi 1985).

(2002) and Lima et\u00a0al. (2007). The\u00a0first \nvolcanic episode was between 585\u2013590\u00a0Ma (Janikian et\u00a0al. \n2008) and is dominantly characterized by intermediate \nrocks with shoshonitic affinity (Bom Jardim Group, Hilario \nFormation). This volcanic episode is followed by a bimodal \nvolcanism with sodic mildly alkaline volcanism (Bom \nJardim Group, Acampamento Velho Formation) and ages \nbetween 560\u2013550\u00a0Ma at the Ramada Plateau (Matt\u00e9 et\u00a0al. \n2016, Sommer\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2005a) and 574\u00a0Ma at the Passo do \nSalsinho Region (Chemale Jr. 2000, Janikian et\u00a0al. 2008). \nThe\u00a0Acampamento Velho Formation (AVF) is the extrusive \ncounterpart of the voluminous granitic magmatism, mostly \nmetaluminous with minor peralkaline components, gener-\nated in the Brasiliano\u2013Pan African cycle (Nardi &amp; Bonin \n1991). This episode is mainly exposed in volcanic plateaus \nand ridges composed mostly of acid effusive and pyroclas-\ntic rocks with minor intermediate and basic components \n(Sommer et\u00a0al. 2005a, Wildner et\u00a0al. 2002, Almeida et\u00a0al. \n2002). Eruptive periods were initiated with explosive epi-\nsodes and closed by effusive events (Sommer et\u00a0al. 2006). \nThe\u00a0best exposures of this volcanic sequence are in the \nRamada Plateau (Vila Nova do Sul City), Taquaremb\u00f3 Plateau \n(Dom Pedrito City), Bugio and Perau Hills (Ca\u00e7apava do \nSul area, Santa B\u00e1rbara Hill), besides the Tupanci region, \nthe northernmost exposure of this volcanism in the SRGS. \nAlthough some research has been developed in the depos-\nits of the Tupanci region (Menegotto &amp; Medeiros 1976, \nRoisenberg et\u00a0al. 1986, Leitzke et\u00a0al. 2015), integrated and \ndetailed geochemistry, geochronology and isotopic data are \nscarce for this area. \n\nTherefore, this paper focuses on dating and isotope sys-\ntematics of acid volcanic rocks from the AVF in the Tupanci \nregion, Brazil. We\u00a0present new zircon U-Pb geochronological \ndata for the high-silica volcanic successions, which\u00a0coupled \nwith Sm-Nd-Pb isotope systematics, and whole-rock geo-\nchemistry from literature data, enabled to better constrain \nthe magmatic source and genesis of acid volcanic associations \nthat occur in neoproterozoic post-collisional tectonic settings.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe SRGS (Fig. 1) is the southern portion of the \nMantiqueira Province, located in the Rio Grande do Sul \nstate, Brazil (Almeida et\u00a0al. 1981). This shield includes \nrocks related to Brasilian\u2013Pan African neoproterozoic oro-\ngenic cycle and a metamorphic basement of paleoprotero-\nzoic age, constituted by remaining fragments of the Rio \nde la Plata Craton (Teixeira et\u00a0al. 2004). Well-preserved \nvolcano-sedimentary sequences linked to magmatism in \n\nthe collisional and post-collisional stages of the Brasilian \norogenic cycle (Sommer et\u00a0al. 2005a) are grouped in the \nCamaqu\u00e3 Basin (CB).\n\nThe CB is a retroarc basin that includes a set of preserved \nsedimentary and volcanogenic units, which were deposited \nbetween 620 and 535\u00a0Ma (Brito Neves &amp; Cordani 1991, \nGresse et\u00a0al. 1996, Brito Neves et\u00a0al. 1999, Chemale Jr. \n2000, Fragoso-C\u00e9sar et\u00a0al. 2000, 2003, Paim et\u00a0al. 2000, \nSommer et\u00a0al. 2006, Janikian et\u00a0al. 2008, 2012). The\u00a0base-\nment of the CB is heterogeneous and ranges from paleopro-\nterozoic granulitic complex to associations of metamorphic \nand deformed igneous rocks related to the Brasiliano\u2013\nPan-African orogeny (Paim et\u00a0al. 2000, Lima\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2007). \nThe\u00a0evolution of the CB includes an alternation between \naccumulation periods, with the predominance of volca-\nno-sedimentary sequences and erosional periods. The\u00a0sedi-\nmentary sequence of CB is represented (Borba et\u00a0al. 2007) \nfrom base to top by: \n\n ? Maric\u00e1 Formation, with marine and coast deposits; \n ? Bom Jardim Group, with alluvial deposits intercalated \n\nwith andesites, acid effusive and pyroclastic rocks (Hil\u00e1rio \nand Acampamento Velho formations); \n\n ? Camaqu\u00e3 Group characterized by fluvial, lacustrine \nand aeolian continental deposits (Santa Barbara and \nGuaritas formations). \n\nThese stratigraphic units evolved mainly in continental \nenvironments and the volcanism under subaerial conditions \n(Wildner et\u00a0al. 2002). \n\nVolcanic cycles in the CB occurred during a transition \nbetween a collisional and post-collisional period devel-\noped from the Neoproterozoic III to the Early Cambrian \nduring the Brasiliano\u2013Pan-African orogeny. The\u00a0magmatic \nsource of these rocks is probably related to partial melting \nof a lithospheric mantle previously chemically affected by \na subduction process (Nardi &amp; Bonin 1991, Wildner et\u00a0al. \n1999, 2002, Nardi &amp; Lima 2000, Almeida et\u00a0al. 2005, \nSommer\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2006). Sommer et\u00a0al. (2005a, 2005b, 2006) \nsuggest that these volcanic cycles represent preserved portions \nof a typical evolutionary sequence from a post-collisional \nmagmatism (from Li\u00e9geois 1998), with shoshonitic affin-\nity rocks in the early stages, chemically affected by subduc-\ntion-related processes, followed by silica-saturated bimodal \nvolcanic sequences, with sodic-alkaline affinity and finally \nby tholeitic rocks. \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nSamples analyzed in this study were collected at the \nTupanci region, along the Tupanci and Picados hills, northwest \n\n547\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(4): 545-560, December 2017\n\nCarlos Augusto Sommer et al.\n\n\n\nof the SRGS (Fig. 2). Acid igneous rocks occur as shallow \nintrusions (hypabyssal rocks) at the Tupanci Hill and as \nlava flows (porphyritic rhyolites) and pyroclastic deposits \n(ignimbrites) at the Picados Hill. In this section, we will \n\nsummarize the main petrographic and geochemical features \nof both occurrences, which were studied in detail by Leitzke \net\u00a0al. (2015) and are necessary for the interpretation of new \nisotopic data reported in this study. \n\nFigure 2.

The\u00a0rhyolitic rocks are porphyritic, \nand the best outcrops are dominantly in the north-central \nportion of the hill. Pyroclastic rocks have a high degree of \nwelding and predominate in the southern portion of the \narea. In\u00a0this region lapilli-size fragments, with abundant \nlithic fragments, predominate. Predominantly, reomor-\nphic portions are less abundant, being mostly ash-size crys-\ntal-rich fragments. \n\nThe effusive regime is characterized by porphyritic rhy-\nolites with phenocrysts of quartz and sanidine set in an \naphanitic glassy matrix (Figs. 3A-3D). Igneous flow foliation \nis mainly sub-horizontal and shows some autobrecciated \nportions (Fig. 3E). Microphenocrysts of opaque minerals, \nzircon and apatite occur as accessory minerals. Mafic min-\nerals are predominantly biotite and chlorite, possibly orig-\ninated by alteration of amphiboles. The\u00a0biotite grains are \nsubhedral, with diameter from 0.5\u20131\u00a0mm, ranging from \nbrown to green and poikilitic texture. Biotite\u00a0aggregates \nassociated with chlorite has almost entirely replace amphi-\nbole crystals. The\u00a0very fine matrix consists of a micro to \ncryptocrystalline quartz-feldsphatic arrange. Devitrification \n\nprocesses are common and several stages are observed, \nwith spherulitic, axiolithic texture and granophyric inter-\ngrowths (Fig. 3F).\n\nExplosive volcanism in the area is characterized by poorly \nselected ignimbrites with fragments ranging from ash to \nlapilli size, consisting of rock, crystal and glass fragments \n(Fig. 4). The\u00a0ignimbrites are strongly welded and have rhy-\nolitic composition. These rocks may be divided into two \nfacies: lithic-rich ignimbrites (IgL); and rheomorphic crys-\ntal \u2014 rich ignimbrites (IgnReo). \n\nThe IgL corresponds to poorly selected brownish to \npink color rocks with predominance of lapilli size fragments \n(Fig.\u00a04A) immersed in a tuffaceous matrix. Lithic fragments \nare common and constituted by fragments of rhyolites and \nignimbrites. Fragments of pumice (Fig. 4) occur in various \nsizes in the matrix and as lapilli fragments (Fig. 4). They\u00a0are \ndevitrified to a quartz-feldpathic granophyric arrangement \nwith a low degree of flatenning, even though in some por-\ntions of the rock it is possible to identify an incipient eutax-\nithic texture. Alteration processes leave a reddish-brown \nclay-rich layer over the fragments. Quartz and alkali-feldspar \ncrystal fragments are few. These mineral phases also occur as \nphenocrysts, with similar sizes, subhedral to euhedral and \nsome of them preserved within the pumices. The matrix is \nextremely fine and supported by shards with spike geome-\ntry, with lengths smaller than 0.5\u00a0mm (Fig. 4B).\n\nFigure 3. Summary of macro and microscopic features of representative effusive rocks at the Tupanci and Picados \nHill (cf. Leitzke et al. 2015): (A) porphyritic rhyolite with glassy matrix; (B) fractured sanidine phenocryst in \ndevitrified matrix; (C) glomeroporphyritic texture with euhedral quartz and k-feldspar phenocrysts; (D) reabsorbed \nquartz phenocryst with surrounding igneous flow foliation; (E) quartz phenocryst with microbreccia features; \n(F) spherulites showing evidence for high-temperature devitrification of the matrix.\n\nA B C\n\nD E F\n\n549\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 47(4): 545-560, December 2017\n\nCarlos Augusto Sommer et al.\n\n\n\nRheomorphic ignimbrites in the area are characterized \nby high degrees of welding (Fig. 4C) and a great amount \nof crystal fragments (phenocrysts and fragments) in a very \nfine-grained eutaxithic and often parataxithic matrix. \nThese\u00a0factors can be used to characterize them as \u201clava-like\u201d \nignimbrites (Ekren et\u00a0al. 1984). Pyroclastic fragments are \npredominantly represented by quartz and alkali feldspar and \nstretched/deformed pumices (Fig. 4D). The\u00a0lithic fragments \nare rare and, when observed, have rhyolitic composition. \nPumice fragments are flattened (fiamme) and devitrified to \nquartz-feldspar aggregates. \n\nTupanci Hill area\nThe Tupanci Hill area comprises a N-S elongated subvol-\n\ncanic body with a dominant NE-SW fault pattern. The\u00a0main \nlithology is represented by porphyritic rhyolites with phe-\nnocrysts of sanidine and quartz surrounded by an equi-\ngranular-fine-grained to aphanitic quartz-feldspar matrix, \nwith a strong flow foliation on border regions, where phe-\nnocrysts are substantially smaller in size. Spherulites occur \nin the matrix or around phenocrysts, showing evidence for \nhigh-temperature devitrification processes (Logfren\u00a01971). \nMicrophenocrysts of opaque minerals (pyrite), zircon, apatite \nand altered mafic minerals occur as accessories. Mafic miner-\nals are rare and occur altered to chlorite. Small\u00a0(?\u00a00.05\u00a0mm) \nacicular crystals of late crystallization sodic amphibole \n(arfvedsonite) occur in the matrix, suggesting a peralkaline \naffinity. Fragments\u00a0of sedimentary wall rocks of the Maric\u00e1 \n\nFormation occur as xenoliths. Microfolded portions, rotated \nand fractured crystals (microbreccias) are also observed on \nthe border of the intrusion, generating \u201ctuff-like\u201d textures \nsimilar to eutaxitic and parataxitic textures in pyroclastic \nrocks (Manley 1995), common in rhyolitic systems due to \nthe high viscosity of the flow (Figs. 4E and 4G). \n\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nThe geochemical features of both groups of rocks were \n\ndescribed in detail by Leitzke et\u00a0al. (2015) and are simi-\nlar for major elements, but show distinct aspects regard-\ning trace elements. The\u00a0rocks have high contents of SiO2 \n(73\u00a0to 77\u00a0wt.%), alkalis (Na2O+K2O > 8.4 wt.%) and FeOt/\n(FeOt+MgO) (>\u00a00.9); with low contents of Al2O3, CaO and \nMgO; and \u00a0agpaitic index close to the unity (> 0.9). At the \nNb/Y versus Zr/TiO2 classification diagram, these rocks are \nclassified as rhyolites, which are confirmed by the Zr/TiO2 \nversus SiO2 diagram, in which some samples are classified \nas alkali rhyolites (Fig.\u00a05). Major and trace elements data \nallowed the identification of two different evolutionary trends: \nlow\u00a0and high-Ti, related respectively to the effusive/pyroclastic \nrocks of the Picados Hill and subvolcanic rocks of Tupanci \nHill (Leitzke et\u00a0al. 2015). The\u00a0same behavior is observed \nfor trace and rare earth elements (REE) in multi-element \nvariation diagrams. Zr contents are higher than 500\u00a0ppm \nfor the high-Ti group that indicates, according to Leat et\u00a0al. \n(1986), a peralkaline affinity for these rocks. On\u00a0the other \nhand, the low-Ti group has Zr contents not higher than \n420 ppm. Ba and Sr contents are >\u00a070 and 8\u00a0ppm in the \nhigh-Ti group and &lt;16 and 6\u00a0ppm, respectively. Rb\u00a0dis-\nplays high contents in both groups, but concentrations are \nmuch higher in the low-Ti group (> 170\u00a0ppm) than in the \nhigh-Ti group (&lt;100\u00a0ppm). Nb, Y and Ga behave in\u00a0a sim-\nilar way, with higher contents for the low-Ti group (>\u00a050, \n130 and 25\u00a0ppm) compared to the high-Ti group (<\u00a030, \n70 and 26\u00a0ppm). High contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga and Rb \nand low contents of Ba and Sr for rocks of both groups \n(cf. Leitzke et\u00a0al. 2015) are characteristic of acid magma-\ntism with alkaline affinity (Pearce et\u00a0al. 1984, Whalen et\u00a0al. \n1987, Nardi 1991). \n\nANALYTICAL PROCEDURES\n\nThis work presents a new isotopic dataset (zircon U-Pb, \nSm-Nd and Pb-Pb) obtained on volcanic and hypabyssal \nrocks from the Tupanci area, which are coupled to whole-\nrock geochemistry data (Leitzke et\u00a0al. 2015) to provide a \nbetter understanding of the evolution of the Acampamento \nVelho volcanism in the SRGS.

In\u00a0the Picados \nHill (PH), three samples of the low-Ti group were selected \nfor isotope determination. Additionally, a porphyritic rhy-\nolite (sample CT-66) was selected for zircon U-Pb geochro-\nnology. Location of selected samples for the U-Pb zircon \nseparation and isotopic measurement are given in Figure 2. \nIsotopic analyses were conducted at the University of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo (USP) and at the Federal University of Rio Grande \ndo Sul (UFRGS), and are described in detail in the follow-\ning sections.\n\nZircon U-Pb geochronology \n(U-Pb LA-ICP-MS)\n\nApproximately 0.5\u00a0kg of sample material was crushed, \npulverized and sieved for zircon separation. The\u00a0zircon grains \nwere concentrated using conventional magnetic and heavy \nliquid techniques, after which more than 300 grains were \nhandpicked and mounted in epoxy resin. From this popula-\ntion, 13 grains were analyzed from the high-Ti group (sam-\nple CT-38) and five grains from the low-Ti (sample CT-66). \n\nThe mount was polished using different granulomet-\nric pastes of diamond to expose the internal surfaces of the \nzircon. For the dating, the zircon grains were imaged using \nbackscattered electrons and cathodoluminescence to deter-\nmine their internal structures and crystallization phases. Only \nzircon grains without imperfections, fractures, and min-\neral inclusions were selected for isotopic analyses. All U-Pb \nisotopic analyses were performed at the Geochronological \nResearch Center of the Geoscience Institute, USP, using\u00a0a \nThermo Fischer Scientific Neptune inductively coupled \nplasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and a 193\u00a0nm excimer \nlaser ablation (LA) system (Photon Machines - Redmond, \nWashington, USA).\n\nThe details of the ICP-MS configurations and the laser \nparameters used during the analyses are available in Oliveira \net\u00a0al. (2015). The\u00a0analytical procedure of the U-Pb method \nincluded the analysis of the materials in the following \nsequence: two blanks, two synthetic glass NIST standards , \nthree external reference materials, 13 samples, two external \nreference materials, and two blanks. Each experiment con-\nsisted of 40 cycles of 1 s/cycle. The 204Hg interference for \n204Pb was corrected using 202Hg, in which 204Hg/202Hg\u00a0=\u00a04.2. \nBoth NIST glass and external reference material were used \nto normalize the 207Pb/206Pb ratio, whereas the external ref-\nerence material was used to normalize the 238U/206Pb ratio. \nThe standard GJ-1 (602 \u00b1 4.4\u00a0Ma; Elhlou et\u00a0al. 2006) was \nused as the external reference material. Zircon typically con-\ntains low concentrations of common Pb. Thus, the reliability \nof the measured 207Pb/206Pb and 238U/206Pb ratios critically \ndepends on accurately assessing the common Pb compo-\nnent. The residual common Pb was corrected based on the \nmeasured 204Pb concentration using the known terrestrial \ncomposition (Stacey &amp; Kramers 1975).\n\nExternal errors were calculated using error propagation \nfor the individual measurements of the standard GJ-1 and \nthe individual zircon sample measurements (spots). The\u00a0ages \nwere based mainly on 238U/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb ratios and \ncalculated through Isoplot software version 4.0\u00a0(Ludwig\u00a02008). \n\nFigure 5.

Whole rock samples were \npowered in agate mortar in order to get fraction lower than \n200\u00a0mesh. Then, the samples were digested together with \na 149Sm/150Nd spike through concentrated HF-HNO3 and \nHCl in 7 mL teflon vials in a hot plate for seven days. After \ncomplete digestion, the samples were dried down and redis-\nsolved in 2.5 N HCl, and the REE were separated by using \nstandard cation exchange chromatography with a DOWEX \nAG 50X8 resin (200\u2013400\u00a0mesh) using 6 N HCl. Nd and \nSm were separated from the other REE by using HDEHP \nLN resin (50\u2013100\u00a0mm) and collected after elution with 0.18 \nN HCl for Nd and 0.5 N HCl for Sm. Pb was separated \nusing DOWEX AG 1X8 resin (200\u2013400\u00a0mesh) with 0.6N \nHBr and 6 N HCl. The\u00a0isotopic analyses were carried out \nin static mode. Sm and Pb were run on Re single filaments, \nwhile Nd isotopes were loaded on Ta-Re-Ta triple filaments. \nSm, Nd and Pb were deposited with H3PO4, and the latter \nwas also deposited with silica gel. Nd isotopic ratios were \nnormalized to 146Nd/144Nd = 0.7219 and repeated measure-\nments of La Jolla Nd reference material furnished a mean \n143Nd/144Nd value of 0.511848 \u00b1 0.000021 (1s; n = 100). \nPb\u00a0was corrected from a mass discrimination effect of 0.1% \namu-1 based on 38 analyses of NBS-981 reference material. \nThe\u00a0total procedure blanks were lower than 500 pg for Sm, \n150 pg for Nd, and 100 pg for Pb. Typical analytical errors \nfor 147Sm/144Nd and 206,207,208Pb/204Pb ratio were equal or better \nthan 0.1%. Nd-TDM model ages were calculated according \nto De Paolo (1981). The\u00a0decay constants recommended by \nSteiger and J\u00e4ger (1977) and Wasserburg et\u00a0al. (1981) were \nused. The\u00a0error for all isotopic data were lower than 25\u00a0ppm \nfor Sm/Nd; 20\u00a0ppm for 143Nd/144Nd; and\u00a0lower than 0.0020 \n(SD absolute) for Pb isotopic analyses. \n\nRESULTS\n\nZircon morphology and U-Pb results\nThe zircon populations comprise elongate, prismatic, \n\nsubrounded grains, rarely showing well-preserved bipyra-\nmidal faces. These grains show low length-to-width ratios \nfrom 2:1 to 14:1 (with the average of 5:1), which are char-\nacteristics for deep-seated and slowly cooled intrusions \n(Corfu et\u00a0al. 2003). Such morphological features suggest \n\nthat zircon grains selected for the analysis are magmatic. \nCathodoluminescence (CL) images of selected zircon grains \n(Fig. 6) from each sample allowed the recognition of inclu-\nsions and fractures and metamictic domains, which were \navoided during the analyses, whenever possible. Some zir-\ncon grains display darker cores developed during magmatic \ncrystallization. Zircon crystals from sample CT-66 show \nclear signs of alteration (Fig. 6) and high contents of com-\nmon lead (14 to 59%), which affected negatively on the \nages obtained for this group of analysis. \n\nHigh-Ti rhyolite (sample CT-38)\nZircons from this sample are bright when analyzed \n\nthrough CL, although a few zircons exhibit either dark rims \nor dark cores (Fig. 6A). The\u00a0U-Pb analytical data are pre-\nsented in Table 1 and plotted in Concordia diagram (Tera \n&amp; Wasserburg 1972), based on 207Pb/206Pb versus 238U/206Pb \n(Fig. 7A). All\u00a0the zircon crystals have very high contents \nof U (1,679\u20134,296\u00a0ppm) and Th (1,089\u20134,086\u00a0ppm), \nbut common Pb is still very low. Thirteen analyzed zircon \nyield a range in the 206Pb/238U ages from 559 to 605\u00a0Ma \nand all the analytical points are concordant. Therefore a \nConcordia age of 579 \u00b1 5.6\u00a0Ma (mean square weighted \ndeviation - MSWD = 0.16) has been calculated using these \nzircons (Fig. 7A), which is interpreted as the crystalliza-\ntion age of this sample.\n\nFigure 6.

When\u00a0com-\npared to the sample CT-38, these zircons are not as clear, \nwhich reflect hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 6B). A\u00a0few zir-\ncons exhibit locally either dark rims or dark cores (Fig.\u00a06B). \nThe\u00a0U-Pb analytical data are presented in Table 1, and plot-\nted in the conventional Concordia diagram (Whetherill \n1956) based on 238U/206Pb versus 207Pb/235U (Fig. 7B). \nThe\u00a0five analyzed fractions yield a range in the 207Pb/206Pb \nages from 553 to 588\u00a0Ma and are discordant. A\u00a0Discordia \n(Fig. 7B) using the five fractions yields an upper intercept \nat 558 \u00b1 39\u00a0Ma with a low MSWD (0.70). This\u00a0high error \nis due to the small number of crystals used for dating asso-\nciated with the high content of uranium, which may have \nbeen lost due to alteration and deterioration of the crys-\ntalline reticulum. \n\nSm-Nd isotopic results\nFor Sm-Nd whole-rock determination and TDM age cal-\n\nculation, five samples were selected: \n\n ? Two from the high-Ti rhyolites of the Tupanci Hill \n(CT-37A, CT-37B); \n\n ? Three samples from the low-Ti rhyolites of the Picados \nHill (CT-47A, CT-49A, CT-50A). \n\nTable 2 shows the Sm-Nd isotopic results as well as \nthe initial eNd values calculated at the time of emplace-\nment, which is yielded by the zircon U-Pb ages obtained \nin this study. For the high-Ti samples, a crystallization age \nof 579\u00a0Ma is assumed, while the age of 558\u00a0Ma is assumed \nfor the emplacement of the low-Ti rhyolites. \n\nThe set of results provided TDM model ages of 1.83 and \n2.22\u00a0Ga and more negative present day eNd(0) values of -17.47 \nand -18.00 for the high-Ti rhyolites, while the low-Ti rhyolites \nexhibit negative eNd(0) values from -10.43\u00a0to -9.60. The\u00a0eNd(t) \nof the high-Ti samples are of -12.15 and -11.15, while low-Ti \nsamples show eNd(t) ranging from -11.21 to -10.09. The\u00a0high-Ti \nrhyolites displayed homogeneous 147Sm/144Nd ratios of 0.125 \nand 0.104, which are within the 0.080\u20130.120 range, usu-\nally considerable acceptable for TDM age calculation.

The\u00a0ratios are 15.830?16.006 for 206Pb/204Pb; \n15.062?15.097 for 207Pb/204Pb; and 36.567?36.862 for \n208Pb/204Pb (Table 2).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTiming and emplacement of volcanic \nepisodes of the Acampamento Velho \nFormation in the NW of the SRGS\n\nRecent geochronological literature data provided ages between \n549 and 573\u00a0Ma (Tab. 3) for the volcanic rocks of the AVF. \nAt\u00a0the Passo do Salsinho region, U-Pb SHRIMP zircon anal-\nysis in rhyolitic lavas revealed ages of 573\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma (Chemale \nJr. 2000). Similar and more precise results of 572\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma were \nobtained through Pb/Pb isotopic ratio in zircon grains from \ngranitoids of the Le\u00f5es Ring Complex (Gastal &amp; Lafon 2001). \nThese granitoids are genetically associated with the volcanic rocks \nof the Taquaremb\u00f3 Plateau. U-Pb zircon analysis in volcanic \n\nrocks of the Ramada Plateau provided the age between 549\u00a0and \n560\u00a0Ma to the AVF volcanism, which suggests a greater time \nspan for this volcanic episode in the SRGS (Sommer et\u00a0al. \n\nFigure 7.

Analysis of two rhyolitic pebbles \nfrom the conglomeratic fluvial deposits of the basal portion \nof the AVF provided zircon U-Pb ages of 579 \u00b1 13\u00a0Ma and \n569\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma (Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012). However, these authors \nproposed the individualization of a new younger acid volcanic \nunit related to reactivation of extensional structures identified in \nTaquaremb\u00f3 Plateau, for\u00a0which the crystallization age, obtained \nby U-Pb LA-ICP-MS method in lapilli-tuffs previously con-\nsidered as part of the AVF, is 544.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5\u00a0Ma (Wildner et\u00a0al. \n1999, 2002, Sommer et\u00a0al. 2006). This was correlated with \nthe U-Pb zircon SHRIMP age of 549.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma obtained by \nSommer et\u00a0al. (2005a) in hypabyssal rhyolites of the Ramada \nPlateau. The\u00a0new age of 579 \u00b1 5\u00a0Ma of the high-Ti rhyolites \nfrom the AVF obtained in this study is in agreement with those \nones previously obtained in the literature (Chemale Jr. 2000, \nJanikian et\u00a0al. 2005, 2008, Gastal &amp; Lafon 2001, Sommer\u00a0et\u00a0al. \n2005a, 2006). For the age of 558 \u00b1 39\u00a0Ma obtained in the \nlow-Ti group, the high uncertainty associated with the data \nmay indicate an overlap with the ca. 570\u00a0Ma event of the AVF, \nor suggest a younger volcanic episode at the Camaqu\u00e3 Basin \n(cf., Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012, Matt\u00e9 et\u00a0al. 2016).\n\nTrace element geochemistry indicates that rocks from \nthe high-Ti group were likely generated in a post-collisional \nsetting, while those ones of the low-Ti group were gener-\nated in a progressive post-collision to intraplate setting (cf. \nLeitzke et\u00a0al. 2015). Assuming this, it is expected that our \ngeochronological results are coherent with the tectonic envi-\nronment, and, therefore, show distinct ages between both \ngroups. Nevertheless, the poorly constrained age for the \n\nlow-Ti group still does not allow to confirm the tectonic \nenvironment distinction between both groups. Regarding \nwhole-rock trace element patterns, both high and low-Ti \ngroups have high contents of HFSE (Zr, Nb, Y), Ga and \nRb, together with lower contents of Ba and Sr (Fig. 8A), \ncharacteristic of acid magmatism with an alkaline affinity, \ntypical of final stages of orogenic cycles, with sources previ-\nously affected by subduction-related metasomatism (Pearce \net\u00a0al. 1984, Whalen et\u00a0al. 1987, Nardi 1991, Sommer et\u00a0al. \n2005a). The\u00a0magmatism of the AVF has been recognized \nto be produced from subduction-modified mantle sources, \nlikely of EM1 type, during the final stages of Brasiliano\u2013Pan-\nAfrican cycle (Wildner et\u00a0al. 2002). Moreover, the origin \nof the rhyolitic liquids has been modelled to be fractional \ncrystallization of plagioclase+alkali feldspar+pyroxene+-\nmagnetite from trachytic magmas, which, in turn, are pro-\nduced by differentiation of mildly alkaline basaltic magmas \n(Sommer et\u00a0al. 1999, Matt\u00e9 et\u00a0al. 2012). Shellnutt et\u00a0al. \n(2009) use the Th/Ta ratio to indicate to which extent the \ninteraction crust-mantle was present during the petrogen-\nesis of an igneous association of rocks. This ratio should be \naround 2.0\u00a0produced exclusively by mantle partial melting, \nwhile it should be greater than 6.9 to the ones originated \nby crustal partial melting. In\u00a0our high-Ti group (CT) Th/\nTa\u00a0>\u00a06.9\u00a0predominates, while at our low-Ti group (CP) the \nvalues range between 6.9 and 4.2, indicating crustal contri-\nbution to their origin. According to Eby (1990, 1992), the \nfractionation of \u201cA\u201d type magmas has little effect on the Y/\nNb ratio, which\u00a0could also be used to indicate the source \n\nOutcrop Type of rock Age (Ma) Error (Ma) Method Reference\n\nRamada Plateau Subvolcanic rhyolite 549.0 5.0 U-Pb SHRIMP Sommer et al.

Mantle-derived magmas would have Y/\nNb &lt;1.2, while those of crustal origin should have it > 1.2. \nThese geochemical criteria would indicate crustal origin for \nboth groups of acid volcanic rocks in this study, in which Y/\nNb ranges from 1.6 to 4.1 (cf. Leitzke et\u00a0al. 2015).\n\nIn both groups, REE are present in moderate to high con-\ncentrations (?REE = 198\u2013694\u00a0ppm). The\u00a0fractionation between \nlight rare-earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements \n(HREE) is low for the low-Ti (CP) group (LaN/YbN = 1.7\u20136.9) \nand higher for the high-Ti (CT) group\u00a0(LaN/YbN = 3.48\u201317.64). \nIn general terms, the fractionation of LREE is more pronounced \nthan HREE, with LaN/SmN (1.6\u20135.1) higher than TbN/LuN \n(1.2\u20131.5). In\u00a0all samples, there is a strong negative Eu anom-\naly (Eu/Eu* = 0.01\u20130.19), related to its bivalent character and \nconsequently previous fractionation into feldspars. As\u00a0already \nobserved for the AVF at the Ramada Plateau, the high-Ti rhy-\nolites are enriched in REE, mainly LREE, when compared to \nthe low-Ti group (Fig. 8B). These characteristics were also iden-\ntified in other occurrences of the AVF at the SRGS (Sommer \net\u00a0al. 2005b, 2006), where low and high-Ti groups of basalts and \nrhyolites were identified. The\u00a0magmatic source of these groups \nand their petrogenetic correlation are still not well constrained.\n\nWhen compared to tectonic environment (Fig. 9) trace \nelement patterns (cf. Pearce et\u00a0al. 1984), the samples are \ndivided accordingly to their group, with high-Ti rhyolites \nshowing a post-collisional settings pattern, while the low-Ti \nare more likely related to intraplate granites, which is coher-\nent with the increase of peralkalinity. In\u00a0the granitoids clas-\nsification diagram (Whalen et\u00a0al. 1987), all the samples are \nclassified as \u201cA\u201d type granites, which are by definition alka-\nline and anorogenic. This classification is confirmed by the \n(104*Ga)/Al > 2.6, Ce+Y+Nb+Zr > 500\u00a0ppm and FeOt/\nFeOt+MgO > 0.9, as proposed by Nardi and Bitencourt \n(2009) for the post-collisional granitic magmatism at the \nsouthern portion of Brazil. Nevertheless, when compared \nto other occurrences of the AVF, the rocks from the high-Ti \ngroup (CT) of the Tupanci area have lower contents of Rb, \nNb, Y and higher of Zr and Ce when compared to the low-Ti \ngroup (CP), suggesting a different evolution for this group.\n\nA\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\nO\nR\n\nG\n\nK\n2\nO Rb Ba Th Ta Nb Ce Hf Zr Sm Y Yb\n\nB\n\nR\nE\n\nE\n/C\n\nh\non\n\ndr\nit\n\ne\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n103\n\nLa Ce Pr Nd Pm Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu\n\nHigh-Ti (CT)\nLow-Ti (CP)\nAc.

Our new ages for the \nhigh-Ti group at the Tupanci area agrees well with previous \nstudies, while the age obtained to the low-Ti group, although \nwith high uncertainty, may be related to different episodes \nof the Acampamento Velho volcanism in its northernmost \nexposure SRGS (cf. Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012).\n\nConstraints for the magmatic sources of \nthe AVF volcanism based on Sm-Nd and \nPb-Pb isotope systematics\n\nThe significance of negative ?Nd and differences in the \n147Sm/144Nd observed in acid lavas can be addressed to \ncrust-derived lavas, or to crustal contamination of basaltic \nlavas during differentiation or metasomatic rocks (Almeida \net\u00a0al. 2005). According to the isotopic results, the high-Ti \ngroup would also represent a fraction of these volcanic epi-\nsodes that had a greater component of crustal contamina-\ntion, since it presents a slightly more negative ?Nd.\n\nTDM model ages (DePaolo 1981, 1988) ranging from 1.83 to \n2.22\u00a0Ga for the high-Ti rocks are in agreement with the ones pre-\nviously obtained (Chemale Jr. 2000, Almeida et\u00a0al. 2005, Janikian \net\u00a0al. 2012), suggesting a contribution of paleoproterozoic basement \nin the source of these magmas (Fig. 10). Isotopic\u00a0data obtained \nfrom rocks of the neoproterozoic plutono-volcanic alkaline asso-\nciation at the Taquaremb\u00f3 Plateau, that also belongs to the AVF \n(Wildner et\u00a0al. 1999), suggest an EM1-type mantle source (Hart \n1988). Chemale Jr. (2000) reported ?Nd (t = 570\u00a0Ma) values \nbetween -15 and -17 and 87Sr/86Sri ratios close to 0.7045, which \nare similar to the results obtained by Gastal and Lafon (1998) for \nintrusive rocks of alkaline associations in the SRGS, correlated to \nthe Taquaremb\u00f3 Plateau magmatism. When\u00a0coupled with major \nand trace elements geochemistry, our\u00a0data suggest that the source \nof the Tupanci magmatism may also be a lithospheric mantle pre-\nviously affected by subduction metasomatic processes. The eNd \nversus time diagram (Fig.\u00a010) compares the Nd isotopic evolution \nof the investigated rocks with distinct crusts (Rio Vacaca\u00ed Terrane, \nSanta Maria Chico Complex and Dom Feliciano Belt) from the \nSRGS (cf. Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012). In\u00a0this context, it is clearly seen \nthat studied samples of the AVF show paleoproterozoic TDM \nages from Rhyacian to Statherian and plot in an intermediate \nposition between the neoproterozoic (Rio\u00a0Vacaca\u00ed Terrane) and \nthe paleoproterozoic crusts (Dom\u00a0Feliciano, Pinheiro Machado \nSuite and Encantada Gneisses). \n\nThe Pb isotope data (Fig. 11) of the studied samples suggest \na significant crustal contribution with lower paleoproterozoic \n\nFigure 11.

The\u00a0high \n147Sm/144Nd ratios of the low-Ti rocks coupled to the REE-\nchondrite normalized pattern observed is a feature produced \nin ultra-evolved silicic magmas attributed to magmatic frac-\ntionation, which may lead to an erroneous estimate of the \nNd model age of the low-Ti rocks. Another possible expla-\nnation for the high 147Sm/144Nd in the low-Ti group could \nbe related to a local source control, mineral sorting, with \nfractionation of minerals such as monazite, or hydrothermal \nalteration (Verma et\u00a0al. 2005). Nevertheless, the similarity \nbetween ?Nd(t) for both rhyolite groups suggest a similar \nsource, which may be a paleoproterozoic crust, as evidenced \nby the 143Nd/144Nd vs. time diagram.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nNew U-Pb ages obtained in zircon grains from high-Ti \nrhyolites from the AVF at the NW portion of the SRGS \nindicate an event at 579.1 +/- 5.6\u00a0Ma and are in good agree-\nment with reported ages for the time span of the AVF vol-\ncanism in the Bom Jardim Group of the CB (cf. Chemale \nJr. 2000, Janikian et\u00a0al. 2005, 2008, Gastal &amp; Lafon 2001). \nA\u00a0second U-Pb age of 558 Ma was obtained for rhyolites \nfrom the low-Ti group at the Picados Hill, although with a \nhigh uncertainty associated (+/- 39\u00a0Ma) probably due to the \nhigh degree of alteration of the zircon grains. Nevertheless, \n\nmore\u00a0precise geochronological data reported recently in the \nliterature may be used to indicate a younger acid volcanism, \nor a greater time span for the AVF volcanism in southernmost \nBrazil (Janikian et\u00a0al. 2012, Matt\u00e9 et\u00a0al. 2016), although the \nhigh uncertainty obtained in this study does not allow this \nissue to be conclusive. Regarding magmatic sources, Sm/Nd \nisotopic data coupled to Pb isotopes and trace element geo-\nchemistry of these rocks indicate variable amounts of paleop-\nroterozoic lower crust melting, in a progressive post-collisional \ndo intraplate environment. The high values for 147Sm/144Nd \nratios of rocks from the low-Ti group are probably related to \nthe fractionation of minerals or hydrothermal alteration of \nthe samples. Our new data allows to better understand the \nstratigraphic evolution of the neoproterozoic post-collisional \nvolcanic successions of the CB in the SRGS and the evolution \nof magmatic cycles during the late stages of the Brasiliano\u2013\nPan-African orogeny in southern Brazil. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge CNPq (303015/2015-2; \n400724/2014-6, 441766/2014-5, 302213/2012-0, \n303584/2009-2, 471402/2012-5, and 470505/2010-9), \nfor\u00a0research funding.
