Fifty carbon fiber posts received surface treatments in order\nto verify their influence on the retention of the core material. An acrylic resin mold was developed in order to precisely\nfit the post, leaving a machined space to accommodate a self-curing composite resin. After the surface treatment, a pri-\nmer was applied on the coronal portion of all posts, which were then dried. They were fitted to the mold and received a\n3 mm composite core. All specimens were thermocycled and then stored in distilled water for a week. Tension test was\nperformed at a speed of 0.5 mm/min until there was lack of adhesion or fracture of the core. The conclusions were:\na) the values of retention related to aluminum oxide spray (group A), depth cutter diamond burs (group C) and posts\nwith machined coronal portion (group D) were comparable to those of serrated posts (group E), although no statisti-\ncally significant difference between these groups was found; b) the mean values of core retention in group B (medium\ngrit diamond burs) were statistically lower than those of other groups.\n\nUNITERMS: Composite resins; Denture retention; Pre-fabricated post.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past few years, improvements in den-\ntal materials have led to a decrease in the utiliza-\ntion of metal, enhanced aesthetics and good me-\nchanical properties. However, researches have\nfocused on restorative materials, with almost no\nconcern about post and core materials. Endo-\ndontic treatment techniques have also been devel-\noped, with more predictable results. Conse-\nquently, endodontically treated teeth have their\nlongevity increased. Despite all modern restorative\nmaterials, there are still a lot of controversies\nabout the need for intraradicular retention and the\ntype of coronal reconstruction2,16,19,20,26,29. SOREN-\nSEN; MARTINOFF28 (1984) stated that there is no\nroot reinforcement related to the placement of a\npost; they have also pointed out the importance of\ncoronal reconstruction in endodontically treated\n\nteeth located in the posterior region. VIRE31 (1991)\nevaluated the possible causes of failure in 116\nendodontically treated teeth, and concluded that\n59.4% of them failed for prosthetic reasons, all re-\nlated to the post.\n\nMany authors agree that the placement of posts\nis directly related to the need for a retention and\nresistance form1,2,13,17,21. The retention and resis-\ntance form depends directly on the amount of\nsound tooth structure, tooth position, restorative\nchoice and occlusal relationship.\n\nAlthough metal-free restorations are aimed at\nin many recent studies, most posts used are still\nmetallic. Many investigations have been carried\nout in order to find out about the possible effects of\ncorrosion products and also to comprehend the\nbehavior of various post materials inside the root\ncanal, especially their modulus of elasticity.\n\n64\n\nMateriais Dent\u00e1rios\n\n* Ph.D Student, UNESP, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos;\n** Associate Professors; *** Chairman \u2013 Dental Materials and Prosthodontics Department, UNESP, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos.\n\n\n\nDURET et al.5 affirmed that the ideal restoration\nfor endodontically treated teeth should have a\nshape identical to that of the root canal, the same\nmechanical properties as dentin and effective ad-\nhesion to the tooth. Carbon fiber posts were intro-\nduced due to their better mechanical properties in\nrelation to metallic posts: their modulus of elastic-\nity is closer to that of dentin5 and they have ele-\nvated resistance to fatigue7. Maybe these proper-\nties are responsible for the occurrence of more\nretrievable fractures related to carbon fiber posts\nwhen compared with pre-fabricated posts and cast\nposts in other studies8,12,13,22,27,30. Metallic posts have\na modulus of elasticity that can be ten times grater\nthan that of dentin7, resulting in greater tension in\nthe root structure6,32. There is also a difference\nwhen comparing cast posts with posts and cores:\naccording to YAMAN; THORSTEINSSON32 (1992),\ncast posts cause greater tension in the apical por-\ntion, whereas posts and cores, in the cervical re-\ngion. Perhaps this fact can explain the greater\nnumber of failures with posts and cores in\nperiodontally compromised teeth. Fatigue is a dis-\nadvantage in metallic posts when compared with\ncarbon-fiber posts; the high percentage of fibers\nprobably leds to incomplete fractures in these\nposts13.\n\nMetal-free restorations are an aim in current\ndentistry, because of aesthetics and the absence of\ncorrosion products2,9,22,23,25. HORNBROOK; HAS-\nTINGS10 (1995) pointed out that cast posts and\namalgam cores can be apparent through the root\nsurface, thus they indicate tooth-colored cores for\nbetter aesthetic results. Regardless of the presence\nof a luting agent, avoidance of different metal al-\nloys for posts and crowns is recommended by\nDEUTSCH et al.4 (1983). The chemical stability\npresented by carbon fiber posts is advantageous\nwhen compared with that of metallic posts9.\n\nPosts should fit dentin apically; the high per-\ncentage of unidirectional carbon fibers (64%) en-\nsures good resistance to fatigue8. According to\nPURTON; LOVE23 (1996), the main advantages of\ncarbon fiber posts are: high resistance to fatigue,\nresistance to corrosion and chemical compatibility\nwith Bis-GMA. FREEDMAN7 (1996) states that car-\nbon fiber posts have less transmission of stress\nwhen compared with titanium posts (about 63%)\nand nickel-chromium posts (about 33%). ISIDOR\net al.12 (1996) applied intermittent load to teeth re-\nstored in three ways: carbon fiber posts and resin\ncement, Para-Posts and cast posts and zinc-phos-\nphate cements; while 85% of the Para-Posts and\n\n100% of the cast posts failed against tensile\nstrength, no carbon fiber post failed. Therefore,\ncarbon fiber posts seem to be a good alternative to\nmetallic posts and their presumed compatibility\nwith composite resins would avoid corrosion prod-\nucts. Some studies8,12,18,27 concluded that the appli-\ncation of force caused less damage to the structure\nof teeth restored with carbon fiber posts when\ncompared with those restored with metallic posts;\nSIDOLI et al.27 (1997) affirmed that there were\nmore retrievable fractures with carbon fiber posts\nthan with other posts. KING; SETCHELL13 (1990)\npointed out the ease to remove them when endo-\ndontic retreatment is necessary.\n\nSome investigations12,24 affirmed that the main\nproblem with carbon fiber posts is the lack of ad-\nhesion to the core material. In order to solve this\nproblem, manufacturers have introduced a ser-\nrated version. This version gained retention to the\ncore while lost rigidity; this mechanical property of\nthe serrated version is now closer to that of metal-\nlic posts but smaller than that of plain carbon fiber\nposts15.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nFifty carbon fiber posts (C-Post, #3, BISCO,\nUSA) were divided into five groups. Four groups\ncontained plain posts that received modifications\nin the coronal portion before the placement of the\ncore. Surface alterations were performed as fol-\nlows: Group A - sandblasting; Group B - medium\ngrit diamond bur; Group C - diamond burs used to\ndetermine the depth for laminate veneers (depth\ncutter); Group D - change of the head form. The\nlast group (Group E) consisted of posts serrated by\nthe manufacturer.\n\nIn Group A, sandblasting (with 50 \u00b5m alumi-\nnum oxide) was carried out at a distance of 1 mm,\nover a length of 3 mm, on the coronal portion.\nPosts from Group B also had a length of 3 mm pre-\npared with a medium grit diamond bur (Diamond\nBurs, number 315, Moyco, USA) in a direction par-\nallel to their long axis; each bur was discarded af-\nter being used in one specimen. Group C received\nthe same preparation with a depth cutter (Dia-\nmond Series, number S4, Moyco, USA); each bur\nwas discarded after a single use. Group D had their\nhead machined as shown in Figure 1.\n\nAll posts received a double coat of Primer B\n(All-Bond, BISCO, USA) and were dried. A ma-\nchined acrylic resin mold was developed and di-\nvided in two halves, where a #3 C-Post fitted ex-\nactly (Figure 2); at the coronal end, a 3 mm space\n\n65\n\nQUINTAS, A. F.; BOTTINO, M. A.; NEISSER, M. P.; ARA\u00daJO, M. A. J. de. Effect of the surface treatment of plain carbon fiber posts on\n\nthe retention of the composite core: an in vitro evaluation. Pesqui Odontol Bras, v. 15, n. 1, p. 64-69, jan./mar. 2001.\n\n\n\nwas created in order to receive a composite resin\ncore. A fine brush with a thin layer of solid Vaseline\nlubricated the coronal end before the placement of\nthe core.\n\nThen, a composite resin especially developed for\ncore build-up (Core-Flo, BISCO, USA) was mixed\nas recommended by the manufacturer and then\ninserted in the 3-millimeter space. The post was\nthen placed and both halves of the mold were\nscrewed and kept under pressure; according to\nDURET et al.6 (1990) it is essential to push the\ncomposite material with some pressure into the\nmicroscopic retentions of the post, in order to link\nit with the matrix of the carbon fiber post. The\ncomposite resin that exceeded the capacity of the\nmold was removed with a spatula before setting.\nAny remaining excess of composite was trimmed\nwith abrasive paper discs (Mooreplastics, garnet\nfine, Moore) placed in a handpiece mandrel.\n\nThe samples were thermocycled (600 cycles,\n30 seconds, 5\u00baC and 55\u00baC) and then kept in dis-\ntilled water for one week.\n\nThe specimens were submitted to tension test\nin an Instron machine (model 4,301). A mandrel\nwas adapted to the Instron machine and a metallic\nframe was developed in order to transmit the force\nexactly in the long axis of the samples (Figure 3), at\na crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The test was\nstopped when there was lack of adhesion or frac-\nture of the core.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe data were submitted to a test of analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA), with a confidence interval of\n5%. There was statistical difference between the\ngroups at a level of 5%. The Tukey comparison test\ndemonstrated statistically significant difference\nbetween Group B and the other groups. There was\nno statistically significant difference related to the\nretention of the core between Groups A, C, D\n(treated plain posts) and E (serrated posts).\nGraphic 1 presents the mean values for all experi-\nmental conditions.\n\nRegarding the type of failure, there was also a\nvisual difference between the groups: the samples\nfrom Group B presented only dislodgment of the\ncore, which was a completely different result from\nthose of the other Groups. In 80% of the specimens\nfrom Group A, there was dislodgment of the core\nwith partial or total fracture of the composite resin.\nIn Groups C, D and E there was core fracture in all\nspecimens (Figure 4).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs stated by LOVE; PURTON15(1996), plain car-\nbon posts are mechanically superior to serrated\nones, because of their greater rigidity. In spite of\nthat, smaller adhesion to the core compromises\nthe retention and resistance form that retains the\ncrown. The results of this study concluded that the\nmacroscopic retention encountered in Groups C,\n\n66\n\nQUINTAS, A. F.; BOTTINO, M. A.; NEISSER, M. P.; ARA\u00daJO, M. A. J. de.

The surface treatments performed in\nGroups C and D transformed plain carbon posts\ninto good clinical alternatives to serrated posts be-\ncause of their mechanical properties. Comparing\nthe results obtained by LOVE; PURTON15 (1996)\nwith the results of this study, it is possible to ob-\nserve that the same kind of failure that occurred in\nGroups C, D and E was found, i.e., fracture of the\ncore in all samples, which reflects the tension in-\nduced in the core material, depending on the\nshape of the head. The alteration produced in\nGroup D is inconvenient for clinical purposes, but\nit is important to suggest that the manufacturers\nkeep the posts plain in the root portion and alter\nthe coronal end for greater retention.\n\nFrom the clinical standpoint, non-catastrophic\nfailures (100% in Group B and 20% in Group A) are\nnot only failures of the restoration \u2013 they may also\ncause great damage to the tooth because of the\ntime interval between the failure and its detection,\nallowing the development of microleakage and root\ncaries. The catastrophic failures in Groups C, D\nand E11 are clinical failures of the restorations and\ndemand their immediate substitution.\n\nThe use of composite resins as core materials is\nmore popular nowadays because they are easy to\nhandle and can be immediately prepared2. How-\never, many factors can contribute to the integrity\nof the interface between the post and the core. The\npossible effect of thermal stress in composite res-\nins is otherwise minimized because there is less\ntransmission of heat under a crown than it would\nbe expected in a direct composite restoration, but\nfurther studies are necessary. CHANG; MILL-\nSTEIN3 (1993) considered posts and cores less reli-\n\nable when compared with cast posts because of the\ngreater number of interfaces. DURET et al.6 (1990)\nstated that the different moduli of elasticity of the\npost material and the core material can affect the\nbonding resistance. The chemical compatibility\nbetween the composite resin of the core and the\nepoxy matrix of carbon posts would lead to a better\ninterface; however, the heat treatment performed\nduring the fabrication of carbon posts can play an\nimportant role in this adhesion, resulting in a\nworse interface.\n\nThe mechanical tension between posts and\nradicular dentin is also related to the type of core\nmaterial15,16,32. Tension is greater for cast posts\nwhen compared with posts and composite cores,\naccording to YAMAN; THORSTEINSSON32 (1992).\nFailures related to the use of composite resins as\ncore materials are mainly related to their low\nmodulus of elasticity29. KOVARIK et al.14 (1992)\npointed out that failures with composite resin\ncores occur at the interface, stressing the impor-\ntance of a good interface; a good quality interface\nshould be expected with chemical and mechanical\nadhesion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\u2022 The surface treatments applied to plain car-\nbon posts \u2013 sandblasting (Group A), diamond burs\nfor laminated veneers (Group C) and alteration of\n\n67\n\nQUINTAS, A.
