A Ria de \nAveiro encontra-se no noroeste de Portugal e cont\u00e9m numerosos sapais. \nHalimione portulacoides \u00e9 um dos hal\u00f3fitos mais importantes em sapais \nEuropeus e tem sido amplamente estudada devido ao seu potencial para ser \nusada em fins de fitorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o, e como bioindicador de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o de \nsedimentos. Bact\u00e9rias endof\u00edticas podem apresentar capacidade promotora do \ncrescimento de plantas (PCP), quer diretamente por produ\u00e7\u00e3o de fito-\nhormonas e aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes, quer indiretamente via competi\u00e7\u00e3o com \nfitopatogenos. No presente trabalho, a diversidade de bact\u00e9rias endof\u00edticas da \nplanta de sapal H. portulacoides da Ria de Aveiro \u00e9 explorada extensivamente.  \n \nIsolados de bact\u00e9rias endof\u00edticas foram obtidos e caracterizados quanto \u00e0 sua \ntaxonomia, capacidade de produzir enzimas e caracter\u00edsticas PCP. As \ncaracter\u00edsticas mais observadas foram atividade celulol\u00edtica, xilanol\u00edtica e \ndesaminase de 1-aminociclopropano-1-carboxilato, e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o da auxina \n\u00e1cido indol-3-ac\u00e9tico. Os resultados revelaram um enorme potencial da \ncole\u00e7\u00e3o para PCP in vitro e in vivo.  \n \nA cole\u00e7\u00e3o de isolados foi tamb\u00e9m explorada para procurar diversidade n\u00e3o \ndescrita. Como resultado, dez novas esp\u00e9cies de bact\u00e9rias foram amplamente \ncaracterizadas e descritas: Microbacterium diaminobutyricum, \nSaccharospirillum correiae, Altererythrobacter halimionae, Altererythrobacter \nendophyticus, Zunongwangia endophytica, Salinicola halimionae, Salinicola \naestuarina, Salinicola endophytica, Salinicola halophytica e Salinicola lusitana. \nConsequentemente, o presente trabalho exp\u00f4s a endosfera de H. \nportulacoides como um foco de diversidade bacteriana desconhecida.  \n \nA composi\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f3mica da comunidade endof\u00edtica foi averiguada via \nsequencia\u00e7\u00e3o do gene 16S rRNA da cole\u00e7\u00e3o de isolados, e mais \nprofundamente com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o de alto rendimento \nindependente do cultivo. A \u00faltima abordagem revelou cinco filos principais: \nProteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes e Firmicutes. \nDestes, apenas Planctomycetes n\u00e3o foi obtido na cole\u00e7\u00e3o de isolados. As \ncomunidades diferiram de acordo com o local (no ensaio dependente do \ncultivo, para locais contaminados e n\u00e3o-contaminado) e tecido (em ambos os \nensaios) de amostragem. As principais fam\u00edlias obtidas no endofitoma nuclear \nforam Oceanospirillaceae em tecidos de parte a\u00e9rea, e Enterobacteriaceae e \nKiloniellaceae em tecidos de raiz.  \n \nO trabalho apresentado providenciou uma compreens\u00e3o profunda das \nbact\u00e9rias endof\u00edticas presentes no hal\u00f3fito H. portulacoides, e exp\u00f4s o seu \npotencial como foco de bact\u00e9rias n\u00e3o descritas e bact\u00e9rias promotoras do \ncrescimento de plantas. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nEndophytic bacteria, Halimione portulacoides, plant growth promotion, bacterial \ndiversity, novel bacterial species, next-generation sequencing, Illumina. \n\nabstract \n \n\n \n\nSalt marshes are highly productive marine ecosystems that often act as a sink \nfor contaminants of anthropogenic nature. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon is located \nin the north-west of Portugal and comprises numerous salt marshes. Halimione \nportulacoides is one of the most important halophytes in European salt \nmarshes and has been widely researched for its potential for phytoremediation, \nand as a bioindicator of sediment contamination. Endophytic bacteria can \npresent plant growth promotion (PGP) abilities, either directly by production of \nphytohormones and nutrient uptake, or indirectly via competition with \nphytopathogens. In the present work, the diversity of endophytic bacteria from \nthe salt marsh plant H. portulacoides from Ria de Aveiro is extensively \nexplored.  \n \nEndophytic bacterial isolates were obtained and characterized for their \ntaxonomy, ability to produce specific enzymes and PGP traits. The most \nobserved traits were cellulolytic, xylanolytic and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-\ncarboxylate deaminase activities, and the production of the auxin indol-3-acetic \nacid. The results revealed an enormous potential of the collection for in vitro \nand in vivo PGP.  \n \nThe collection of isolates was also explored for undescribed diversity. As a \nresult, ten novel bacterial species were thoroughly characterized and \ndescribed: Microbacterium diaminobutyricum, Saccharospirillum correiae, \nAltererythrobacter halimionae, Altererythrobacter endophyticus, Zunongwangia \nendophytica, Salinicola halimionae, Salinicola aestuarina, Salinicola \nendophytica, Salinicola halophytica and Salinicola lusitana. Consequently, the \npresent work exposes the endosphere of H. portulacoides as a hotspot of \nunknown bacterial diversity. \n \nThe taxonomic composition of the endophytic community was assessed via \n16S rRNA gene sequencing of the isolate collection, and with more depth using \nculture-independent high-throughput sequencing. The latter approach revealed \nfive main phyla: Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes \nand Firmicutes. From these, only Planctomycetes was not obtained in the \nisolate collection. The communities differed according to sampling site (for the \nculture-dependent assay, for contaminated and non-contaminated sites) and \ntissue (in both assays). The main families found in the core endophytome were \nOceanospirillaceae for aboveground tissues, and Enterobacteriaceae and \nKiloniellaceae for belowground tissues.  \n \nThe present work provided a deep understanding of the endophytic bacteria \npresent in the halophyte H. portulacoides, and exposed its potential as a \nhotspot of undescribed bacteria and plant growth promoting bacteria.  \n

Laranjo Bay \n\n \n\n1.3 Endophytic bacteria \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n1.1 Plant species: Halimione portulacoides \n\nHalimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen (basonym Atriplex portulacoides, synonym Obione \n\nportulacoides; The International Plant Names Index, 2012), common name sea purslane, is an \n\neudicot from the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, sub-family Chenopodioideae. This \n\nC3 evergreen small shrub can reach 80 cm in height, can be found in acid, neutral and basic soils, \n\nand can grow with little or no shade conditions (Anjum et al., 2014). Leaves from this plant can be \n\nused for human consumption, either uncooked in salads, or cooked as a potherb, and its use for \n\nasthma treatment has been reported (Everest &amp; Ozturk, 2005). With a world wide distribution, H. \n\nportulacoides is the most abundant, and one of the most productive species in ungrazed European \n\nsalt marshes (Bouchard et al., 1998; Anjum et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\nHalophytes are often considered for salt marsh phytoremediation of metals and other \n\ncontaminants, since they represent a relatively inexpensive option for storing contaminants in their \n\nbiomass (Figueira et al., 2012). In addition to H. portulacoides, other halophytes such as Spartina \n\nalterniflora, Juncus maritimus, and Phragmites australis have been considered for their \n\nphytoremediation potential (Williams et al., 1994; Figueira et al., 2012; Amari et al., 2017). The use \n\nof H. portulacoides in phytoremediation of contaminated sediments has been largely researched in \n\nseveral Portuguese marshes, such as Ria de Aveiro, Tagus, Sado, and Guadiana marshes (Can\u00e1rio et \n\nal., 2007). \n\nThe potential for phytoremediation of H. portulacoides has been particularly explored for mercury \n\n(Hg) contaminated sediments. In fact, the ability of this halophyte to be a biomonitor for Hg \n\ncontamination has been explored, since this halophyte is able to give quantitative information \n\nregarding Hg contamination levels in the sediments (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a). Hg is accumulated in \n\nbelowground (BG) tissues of the halophyte, and its concentration in aboveground (AG) tissues is \n\ncomparatively low. Some reasons have been given for this difference in Hg content in both tissues: \n\n(i) Hg mobility occurs primarily between the sediment and BG tissues, and there is a poor \n\ntranslocation of this metal from BG to AG tissues (Can\u00e1rio et al., 2007; V\u00e1lega et al., 2008b; Ca\u00e7ador \n\net al., 2009; Can\u00e1rio et al., 2017), (ii) there is a constant renovation of leaves thus keeping metal \n\ncontent low at any given moment (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a), (iii) there is low accumulation in stems \n\nsince they are transport and not storage organs (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a), (iv) leaves of the halophyte \n\nare able to exude Hg0 from the AG tissues to the atmosphere (Can\u00e1rio et al., 2017). Moreover, \n\nretaining metals in the BG tissues may be a strategy to protect the more sensitive AG tissues from \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nthe effects of the toxic metals (Lozano-Rodriguez et al., 1997). The accumulation of Hg in the BG \n\ntissues causes the halophyte to act as a sink for the toxic element, however, Hg translocation from \n\nBG to AG tissues, albeit low, may act as a potential Hg source in salt marshes (Anjum et al., 2011).  \n\nThe discrepancy in metal accumulation in the different plant tissues has also been observed for \n\nother metals: copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd; Ca\u00e7ador et al., 2009). For cobalt (Co), however, \n\nit was observed that up to 50 % of the total Co content was contained in AG tissues (Ca\u00e7ador et al., \n\n2009). Seasonal variation for Cu, Zn, Cd and Co accumulation was observed in AG tissues, but not \n\nin BG tissues (Ca\u00e7ador et al., 2009). Seasonality was also verified for Hg accumulation in H. \n\nportulacoides (Anjum et al., 2011). \n\nMetal tolerance in H. portulacoides may be associated with the accumulation of these toxic \n\nelements in the cell walls in both BG and AG tissues, preventing the contaminants to exert their \n\neffects in the cytoplasm (V\u00e1lega et al., 2009). Sequestration of Hg into vacuoles via cysteine-rich \n\npeptides is another mechanism for metal tolerance exhibited by salt marsh plants (Can\u00e1rio et al., \n\n2007 and references therein). Recently, phytochelatins have been suggested to have a role in \n\ntolerance to arsenic (As), Zn and lead (Pb) in salt marsh plants under natural conditions (Negrin et \n\nal., 2017). \n\n \n\nThe ability for H. portulacoides to remediate sediments contaminated with other types of \n\ncontaminants has also been examined, namely for hydrocarbons (Almeida et al., 2008; Couto et al., \n\n2011) and tributyltin (Carvalho et al., 2010). Phytoremediation of Cu by salt marsh plants including \n\nH. portulacoides is affected by the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Almeida et al., \n\n2008) and by whether the metal is in ionic or nanoparticle (NP) form (Andreotti et al., 2015; \n\nFernandes et al., 2016). The NP form may result in aggregates which lead to lower Cu accumulation, \n\nthus reducing metal availability and uptake. Consequently, the phytoremediation potential is \n\ndiminished (Fernandes et al., 2016). These additional contaminants and form of contaminant \n\nshould be taken into account when analyzing the potential for phytoremediation in contaminated \n\nsediments.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n1.2 Study area: Ria de Aveiro and Laranjo Bay \n\nSalt marshes are highly productive estuarine ecosystems characterized by high salinity and \n\nperiodical flooding, providing conditions for specialized colonization. In addition to these restrictive \n\nconditions, salt marshes are often affected by anthropogenic activities and are considered a sink \n\nfor contaminants, including metals (reviewed in Williams et al., 1994). \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro lagoon, located in the northwest coast of Portugal alongside the Atlantic Ocean, \n\nis 45 km long and 10 km wide, and contains salt marshes that are subjected to semi-diurnal tides \n\n(V\u00e1lega et al., 2008b). This shallow lagoon contains several channels and extensive inter-tidal areas \n\nand is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a narrow opening known as Barra de Aveiro (Lopes \n\net al., 2001; Anjum et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\nFor over four decades (1950-1994), an industrial complex in Estarreja discharged contaminant-\n\nheavy effluents to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, through a remote branch of the lagoon that ends at \n\nthe Laranjo Bay. In 1994, the reduction of contaminated discharges was achieved with changes on \n\nproduction processes, installation of a recovery plant, a wastewater treatment plant, and a landfill \n\nfor solid waste and contaminated sediments (Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Pereira et al., 1998b). \n\nMain contaminants present in the effluents discharged to Laranjo Bay included aniline, benzene, \n\nmonochlorobenzene, mononitrobenzene, As, Hg, Zn and Pb. Those present in higher \n\nconcentrations were As, Hg, Pb and Zn, where As and Hg were the most severe and spread (Costa \n\nand Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Notwithstanding the diversity of contaminants present in Laranjo Bay, \n\nparticular attention has been given to Hg and its contents in different elements of the ecosystem. \n\nNo biological function is known for Hg, and it is considered a priority by the European Water \n\nFramwork Directive (www.http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework) and on a \n\nglobal scale, since events of bioconcentration, bioaccumulation and biomagnification can be \n\nobserved when this contaminant is present in waters (Pereira et al., 2009 and references therein).  \n\n \n\nThe Laranjo Bay is a lagoon connected to the Ria de Aveiro through a narrow channel. The sediment \n\nat Laranjo Bay is a mixture of sand and mud containing 35-75 % of fine particles (V\u00e1lega et al., \n\n2008b), and exhibits a marked north-south distribution of cohesive sediments. The northern area \n\ncontains more cohesive sediments which allow for an easier adsorption of metallic elements, \n\nresulting in the formation of stable metal-sediment complexes (Lopes et al., 2001).  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe Hg content of the water column is low (10 to 37 pmol dm-3) in comparison with pore waters in \n\nthe sediments (17 to 188 pmol dm-3). The stability of the complexes formed between the metal and \n\nthe sediments prevents the enrichment of the water column (Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Analysis of \n\nthe vertical profiles of Laranjo Bay sediments revealed the lowest Hg content at the core bottom, \n\nan increase and peak of Hg contents in layers at 10 to 25 cm, and a decrease toward the surface \n\nsediments. These profiles reflect a pre-industrial period, followed by the contaminant-heavy \n\ndischarges, and the more recent reduction of intake of industrial contaminants (Pereira et al., \n\n1998a; Pereira et al., 1998b V\u00e1lega et al., 2008b). Analysis of Hg content in the water column and \n\nin the sediments show that the highest concentrations are observed closest to the source of the \n\ncontamination, and a contamination gradient is observed inside the lagoon (Pereira et al., 1998b; \n\nRamalhosa et al., 2006; V\u00e1lega et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\nIn 1998 it was estimated that a 33 ton load of Hg was present in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, and that \n\nmost of this load was confined to the Estarreja Channel and Laranjo Bay: approximately 27 ton in \n\nless than 4 % of the Ria de Aveiro area (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., 1998b). There is evidence \n\nthat Hg is continuously being exported from the Laranjo Bay, especially through tidal forces by \n\nressuspension of the contaminated sediments in the water column (Pereira et al., 1998b; Lopes et \n\nal., 2001). The surface layers of the sediments are more easily eroded and contaminants transferred \n\nto the water column present a potential risk for spread of the contamination throughout the \n\nnetwork of the Ria de Aveiro (Lopes et al., 2001; Pato et al., 2008b). Deeper layers of sediments, \n\nwhich are richer in contaminant content, are not as easily eroded to the water column, unless \n\nevents such as floods and storms are observed. These high evergy phenomena are able to \n\nressuspend Hg-rich particles existent in the sediments and to transfer pore waters to the water \n\ncolumn (Pato et al., 2008a). This erosion of contaminated sediments and consequent export does \n\nnot, however, contribute to a major contamination problem for nearshore sites, since the semi-\n\nenclosed structure of the Laranjo Bay prevents these Hg-associated particles from being \n\ntransported outside the Bay (Lopes et al., 2001). In addition, the complex network of channels in \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro lagoon captures contaminanted particules before coastal waters are reached; and \n\nnearby marine sediments have a low ability to incorporate Hg, reducing the impact on the coastal \n\nzone (Pato et al., 2008b).  \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nVegetated sediments are distinct from non-vegetated sediments in the Laranjo Bay: the vegetated \n\nsediment is more acidic, presents higher redox potential and higher organic matter content (V\u00e1lega \n\net al., 2008c), and is more contaminated with Hg than non-vegetated sediment (V\u00e1lega et al., \n\n2008b). The latter is due to the ability of salt marsh plants to act as sediment traps, contributing to \n\nan elevated Hg content in the sediments, even after the reduction in contaminated effluents from \n\nthe industrial complex (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008c).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n1.3 Endophytic bacteria  \n\nThe phytosphere \n\nThe term phytosphere refers to the entirety of the tissues of a plant, and can be divided into \n\ndifferent compartments (Figure 1.1) such as (i) aboveground (AG) tissues or phyllosphere \n\n(comprising stems, leaves, flowers); and (ii) belowground (BG) tissues or rhizosphere (root system). \n\nFor both compartments, two divisions can be considered: the endosphere (inner tissues) and the \n\nepisphere or ectosphere (outter tissues).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Schematics of the phytosphere. \n\n \n\nAll plants in natural settings have, at least in a phase of their life cycle, association with \n\nmicroorganisms (Partida-Mart\u00ednez &amp; Heil, 2011). Bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and amoeba have \n\nbeen found in the different compartments of the phytosphere, revealing a microbial hotspot in this \n\ncomplex system (reviewed in Hardoim et al., 2015). Vandenkoornhuyse et al. (2015) discussed in \n\ndetail the perspective of the plant as a holobiont, as a dynamic entity composed by the plant host \n\nand its microbiome, working together toward evolutionary fitness. The authors expose that the \n\nholobiont as a whole is the target of evolutionary processes, and that, consequently, the holobiont \n\nas a unit adapts to environmental settings. As a result of this adaption, plant-associated microbes \n\nare involved in functions such as improving the nutrition of the host and the resistance to biotic \n\nand abiotic stresses (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). Plant-associated bacteria are known to \n\npossess these functions, as they can participate in metal tolerance (Can\u00e1rio et al., 2007) and \n\ndegradation of contaminants (Carvalho et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2014a; Oliveira et al., 2014b), \n\namong many other plant-beneficial role.  \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nEndophytic bacteria \n\nDefining endophytic bacteria \n\nThe definition of endophyte has changed throughout the years. In 1926, Perotti described \n\nendophyte as a particular stage in the life of a bacteria, as an advanced stage of infection, which is \n\nsimilar to mutualistic symbiosis (Perotti, 1926). Endophytes were then considered all those \n\nmicroorganisms that could be isolated from surface-sterilized plant organs (Henning &amp; Villforth, \n\n1940). In 1992, Quispel introduced the concept of endophytic bacteria as those that colonize the \n\ninner tissues of the plant without damaging the host or eliciting strong defense responses. The \n\nlatter definition of endophytic bacteria is currently widely used and is the definition that will be \n\nadopted throughout the present work. \n\nBacterial endophytes may present different relationships with their plant hosts in the sense that \n\nthere can be opportunistic or facultative endophytes. The former relates to endophytes that spend \n\npart of their life cycle as an epiphyte and occasionally migrate to inner tissues. The second refers to \n\nthose that exhibit a more mutualistic life style with the plant host. An additional type of endophytic \n\nrelationship is the \u2018obligate\u2019 endophyte, where there is a requirement of plant tissues to complete \n\nthe microorganism\u2019s life cycle. However, obligate endophytes have only been reported for fungi \n\n(Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). \n\nRegarding the function of the endophytic bacteria in the plant host, three groups can be considered: \n\ncommensal, plant growth promoters or latent pathogens. The first group lives on the metabolites \n\nproduced by the plant but have no apparent effect on the host. The second group causes a positive \n\nimpact on the host by protecting against phytopathogens and exhibiting plant growth promoting \n\n(PGP) traits, as detailed below (Hardoim et al., 2015). Consequently, the microbiota of a plant can \n\nbe seen as facilitators in the sense that the host-associated microbes provide additional genes that \n\ncan be useful to adapt to environmental conditions (reviewed in Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). \n\nTwo types of endophytes may be considered according to their host-specificity. The first type \n\ncomprises bacteria that bind to plant root surfaces in a non-specific manner and then migrate to \n\ninner tissues via wounds, cracks and lenticels in the root system. The second type comprises \n\nbacteria that specifically bind to certain plant species, e.g., rhizobia that bind to particular plant \n\nspecies to form nodules (Glick, 2015). Endophytes of the first type are, nevertheless, subjected to \n\nsome degree of specificity due to the fact that different plant species produce different exudates \n\nthat attract certain bacteria (Hardoim et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nColonization of inner tissues  \n\nBacteria can enroll in the endophytic lifestyle either through horizontal or vertical transmission.  \n\nHorizontal transmission results from the entry of bacteria from the external environment into the \n\nplant, and this type of colonization most often occurs as bacteria enter the root system from the \n\nrhizosphere. The most common way of entry occurs via primary and lateral root hair cells, root \n\ncracks, wounds and hydrolysis of root cells. This hydrolysis process may be related to the production \n\nof enzymes with cellulolytic activity, however, colonization still occurs in the absence of cellulases \n\n(reviewed in Santoyo et al., 2016). Entry can also take place at the root tips through germinating \n\nradicles and openings that result from the natural growth process of the roots, or through lenticels \n\n(Hardoim et al., 2008; Santoyo et al., 2016). Colonization by specific groups of bacteria in the root \n\nsystem can result in the formation of root nodules, where nitrogen fixation can occur. Additional \n\nentry points also arise in AG tissues of plants, namely through stomata, lenticels and wounds caused \n\nby other organisms such as insects and fungi, hydathodes, flowers and fruits (reviewed in Hardoim \n\net al., 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). Bacterial taxa present in the ectosphere and in the endosphere \n\nmay differ significantly, suggesting that the endosphere colonizers are equipped with a set of genes \n\nthat allow for their establishment in the inner host tissues (reviewed in Reinhold-Hurek &amp; Hurek, \n\n2011). \n\nVertical transmission occurs when the endophytic bacteria present in the plant seed colonize the \n\nseedling and, further on, the adult plant (Santoyo et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\nThe colonization by soil bacteria into the root system is described as being related to the production \n\nof root exudates and rhizodeposits by the plant host (Hardoim et al., 2015). These exudates are the \n\nproduct of photosynthetic processes and comprise low (amino acids, sugars, organic acids, \n\nphenolics) and high molecular weight compounds (polysaccharides, proteins). The exudates \n\nproduced are dependent on host species and growth stage, and environmental factors. Some root \n\nexudates can act as attractors to bacteria that can then migrate to the inner tissues of the root \n\nsystem (Glick, 2015). \n\nOnce inside the inner tissues, endophytic bacteria reside in intercellular spaces (e.g., Gyaneshwar \n\net al., 2001; reviewed in Hardoim et al., 2015). As a result of the alternative pathways of \n\ncolonization for the different compartments of a plant, there are often divergences in the \n\nconcentration of bacteria in BG tissues (usually more colonized) and AG tissues. This is often \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nobserved in studies that regard endophytic bacteria where a distinction is made in these \n\ncompartments (e.g., Wang et al., 2016). The divergences in communities observed for different \n\nplant tissues may also be due to tissue-specific chemical and/or physical properties (Hardoim et al., \n\n2015). It is widely accepted that the bacteria that colonize the inner root system are able to migrate \n\nto other tissues, namely to AG tissues, and that this dissemination occurs through the vascular \n\nsystem from the roots and shoots (Hardoim et al., 2015; Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015; Reinhold-\n\nHurek &amp; Hurek, 2011 and references therein). These migration phenomena are representative of a \n\nmicrobial endosphere continuity (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 and references therein). \n\n \n\nDiversity of endophytic bacteria \n\nThe bacterial taxonomic diversity and abundance present in the endosphere of a plant depends on \n\nmany factors, including (i) plant-related factors such as the species, sampling tissue, health and \n\ngrowth stage, (ii) soil-related factors such as pH and moisture content, (iii) and abiotic factors such \n\nas temperature and altitude (Hardoim et al., 2008; Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). \n\nThe most common approach to assess the diversity of the bacteria present in a sample relies on the \n\nsequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This ca. 1.5 kb gene is ubiquitous in bacteria, contains highly \n\nconserved regions and nine variable regions, where the sequence changes reflect a measure of time \n\nor evolution, allowing the gene sequence to act as a molecular clock. Although its effectiveness \n\ndepends on the taxa at study, the properties of 16S rRNA gene make its sequencing and analysis \n\nthe standard for bacteria identification usually up to the genus level (Janda &amp; Abbott, 2007 and \n\nreferences therein).  \n\nThe diversity of the bacterial endophytome has been described as mostly pertaining to the phyla \n\nProteobacteria (mainly to the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria), \n\nBacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (Hardoim et al., 2015). The phyla Planctomycetes, \n\nVerrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria are described as being less abundant in the endosphere \n\n(Santoyo et al., 2016). Although only a small number of bacterial phyla are the most associated with \n\nthe endophytic lifestyle, these four phyla contain many genera and species (Hardoim et al., 2015). \n\nIn 2002, Lodewyckx et al. listed in review over eighty genera of endophytic isolates belonging to \n\nboth Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The list of bacterial genera that exhibit the endophytic \n\nlifestyle has been ever-growing as a result of advances in culture media, and also in new sequencing \n\ntechnologies that do not rely on culturability of the bacteria. Although the abovementioned four \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nphyla remain dominant across the endophytome of many plant species, the dominant families and \n\nlower-tier taxa are too host-specific or environment-specific to list. \n\nHydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from the endosphere of H. portulacoides have been assessed \n\nusing a culture-dependent method. This community presented a dominance of Gram-negative \n\nbacteria, which included the genera Pseudomonas, Sphingobium, Acinetobacter and Ochrobactrum. \n\nThe Gram-positive genera Microbacterium and Micrococcus were also dominant (Olivera et al., \n\n2014a). Another study on the culturable fraction of H. portulacoides-associated bacteria, namely \n\nfrom the rhizosphere, also used a hydrocarbon-enrichment step, and showed a dominance of \n\nProteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Oliveira et al., 2014b). These assays where \n\nenrichment medium is used direct the focus of the study to a subset of the community, not \n\nassessing the whole diversity of the halophyte\u2019s endophytome. \n\n \n\nPlant growth promoting traits \n\nEndophytic bacteria can present PGP abilities by direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct \n\nmechanisms include modulating phytohormone levels and enhancing nutrient uptake, while \n\nindirect mechanisms are related to competition with phytopathogens, thus decreasing the \n\nincidence and damages of diseases (Glick, 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). Other mechanisms of \n\ninducing plant growth are known, such as the production of adenine ribosides, volatile compounds \n\nand polyamines, but are less studied (Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). The interactions \n\nbetween plant host and beneficial bacteria are highly dependent on (i) plant species or even \n\ncultivar, and plant growth stage, (ii) the species or even strain of the bacteria, (iii) biotic factors such \n\nas the presence of phytopathogens, (iv) and abiotic factors such as soil properties, presence of \n\ncontaminants, and temperature (Glick, 2015).  \n\nNutrition enhancement methods involve nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron (Glick, \n\n2015; Satoyo et al., 2016). Nitrogen is required in molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins, and \n\ncan be fixed as atmospheric nitrogen by diazotrophic bacteria but not directly by plants (Glick, \n\n2015). The association with diazotrophic bacteria is especially favorable for the plant host in \n\nnitrogen-poor environments (Hardoim et al., 2015). Phosphorus is required as a component of cell \n\nmembranes and for the synthesis of nucleic acids. Most of the phosphorus in the soil is, however, \n\nnot available for uptake by the plant. Some beneficial bacteria are able to secrete compounds that \n\nallow for the solubilization of phosphorous making it available for plant host uptake (Glick, 2015). \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nIron is essential for living organisms as a cofactor of proteins involved in several cellular processes. \n\nThe available iron in the soil is mostly present as insoluble ferric hydroxides which cannot be easily \n\nassimilated by either plant or bacterial cells. Consequently, iron sequestration mechanisms are \n\nnecessary and occur in bacteria, fungi and some plants via the production and excretion of low \n\nmolecular weight molecules called siderophores. These molecules are able to bind ferric iron, and \n\nthis siderophore-iron complex can then be recognized by specific membrane receptors and enter \n\nthe cell. Bacteria that produce siderophores are then able to supply iron for the nutritional needs \n\nof the plant, directly influencing the growth of the host (Glick, 2015).  \n\nDirect PGP mechanisms include the production of phytohormones from different classes such as \n\nauxins, cytokinins and gibberellins, and participating in the decrease of the stress-related \n\nphytohormone ethylene (Glick, 2015; Satoyo et al., 2016). Auxins are known to influence plant \n\nprocesses such as root and shoot growth, tissue differentiation and cell division. Indol-3-acetic acid \n\n(IAA) is an auxin that has been found to be produced by ca. 85 % of rhizospheric bacteria (Glick, \n\n2015) and is thought to affect host growth by interfering with the plant defense system (Hardoim \n\net al., 2015). Phytohormones belonging to the class cytokinins are known to promote plant cell \n\ndivision, seed germination, root elongation, differentiation of xylem and chloroplasts, fruit and \n\nflower development, nutritional signaling, leaf senescence and plant-pathogen interactions (Glick, \n\n2015). This class of phytohormone is commonly observed in endophytes (Hardoim et al., 2015). \n\nGibberellins are known to increase stem growth, flowering, and leaf and fruit senescence (Glick, \n\n2015). The compound 1-amynocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) is the precursor for the \n\nproduction of the stress phytohormone ethylene. In the presence of biotic or abiotic stresses, plants \n\ncan produce an excess of the hormone ethylene which inhibits plant growth. Beneficial bacteria \n\nthat reduce ethylene levels in the plant do so by producing the enzyme ACC deaminase which \n\ncleaves the ACC molecule (reviewed in Santoyo et al., 2016; Glick, 2015; Hardoim et al., 2015).  \n\nIndirect PGP mechanisms are mainly those that allow the endophytic bacteria to compete with \n\nphytopathogenic organisms. Beneficial bacteria that present these mechanisms limit the plant \n\ngrowth inhibition imposed by phytopathogens. The competition can be performed by means of \n\nenzymes that attack cell walls of phytopatogens, production of other antimicrobials, or competing \n\nfor the same habitat and nutrients (Santoyo et al., 2016; Glick, 2015; Hardoim et al., 2015). One of \n\nthe methods to compete for nutrition relies on siderophore production, since beneficial bacteria \n\nare sequestering iron from the environment, making it unavailable for phytopathogens (Glick, 2015; \n\nHardoim et al., 2015). Bacteria can also be beneficial in the fight against phytopathogens by \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nproducing cell wall degrading enzymes such as chitinases, proteases or lipases, which are able to \n\nlyse fungal cells (Glick, 2015). Endophytic bacteria can also lead to a higher tolerance to \n\nphytopathogens by inducing plant defense reactions in an initial phase of colonization. This trigger \n\nin plant immune response allows the host to engage against pathogens in a more efficient manner \n\n(Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). \n\nAs a consequence of direct and indirect PGP mechanisms, the plant fitness in enhanced resulting in \n\nthe perseverance of the plant host in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses. The mechanisms \n\nemployed by PGP endophytic bacteria can amount to several outcomes such as enhanced seed \n\ngermination, increased growth of seedlings, roots and shoots, increased biomass, improved \n\ntolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, production of secondary metabolites, and better plant \n\nnutrition (Glick, 2015). As an example of PGP endophytes in a closely related plant species, a study \n\nconducted on the halophyte Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (same family as H. portulacoides), \n\nshowed that isolates from its endosphere exhibited PGP abilities. Eight isolates belonging to the \n\nfamily Bacillaceae exhibited PGP traits in vitro in the presence of salt, including enzymatic activities \n\n(pectinolytic, chitinolytic, cellulolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic), IAA production, phosphate \n\nsolubilization and siderophore production. A consortium of promising isolates was tested for their \n\nPGP abilities in vivo, and was able to improve seed germination and enhance the salt tolerance of \n\nthe plant host (Navarro-Torre et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe endosphere is a relevant source of bacteria with extensive diversity. This diversity has been \n\nstudied using different approaches, from classic microbiology by plating out macerated surface-\n\nsterilized plant tissues, to molecular techniques. More recent advances in sequencing technologies \n\nhave made available a plethora of molecular-based techniques: clone library construction, \n\ndenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis, 454-pyrosequencing, and most recently \n\nIllumina sequencing. In recent years, the most used approaches have been based on 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequencing from complex communities, however, whole genome metagenomics of the \n\ncommunities has been emerging recently (e.g., Akinsanya et al., 2015). Understanding the core \n\ndiversity present in the endosphere of a plant allows for the development of plant-specific growth-\n\npromoting agents, which can be of chief importance for downstream applications such as \n\nremediation or detoxification processes.   \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n1.4 References \n\nAkinsanya, M.

For this, three main aspects are considered for the scope of the document: \n\n \n\nI. The halophyte H. portulacoides presents phytoremediation capability, and its endosphere is an \n\nunexplored potential source of bacteria that promote plant growth and, subsequently, enhance \n\nphytoremediation processes. Endophytic bacteria will be obtained from sites with different degrees \n\nof metal(loid) contamination, using diverse culture media so as to obtain a representative \n\ncollection. The isolates will then be subjected to several tests aiming at a deep characterization of \n\nthe collection in regards to taxonomy, enzymatic activity and plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. \n\nPromising candidates for PGP will be further tested for their ability to promote growth in model \n\nplants. \n\n \n\nII. The endosphere is a relatively unexplored environment. As a consequence, there is a high \n\nlikelihood that the endophytic bacteria collection will contain novel bacterial taxa, whose \n\ndescription will represent incremental advances in the field of microbiology. For this purpose, \n\nrepresentatives of novel taxa will be described and added to databases respecting established \n\nregulations. \n\n \n\nIII. The in-depth exploration of the endosphere by culture-independent methods has always faced \n\nthe obstacle of host DNA contamination. As such, finding a way to overcome this problem is \n\nfundamental for this type of studies. In-depth analysis of the diversity in the endosphere will be \n\nassessed using PCR blockers that avoid host DNA contamination. \n\n \n\nThis work, overall, has the potential to provide in-depth knowledge on bacterial diversity of \n\nendophytes, on bacterial strains that are adequate for promotion of halophyte growth in \n\ncontaminated sites, and on novel bacterial species. \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n2.2 Main goal \n\nThe main goal of the present work is to characterize endophytic bacterial communities associated \n\nwith the salt marsh plant Halimione portulacoides. \n\n \n\n2.3 Specific goals \n\nIn order to accomplish the proposed main goal, five specific goals were established: \n\nI. Establish a collection of endophytic bacteria from H. portulacoides sampled from sites with high, \n\nintermediate and no metal(loid) contamination.  \n\nII. Understand the structure, diversity and properties of the collection of endophytic bacteria.  \n\nIII. Identify potential candidates for in vivo PGP and perform tests on model plants.  \n\nIV. Identify and describe novel taxa within the endophytic bacteria collection.  \n\nV. Gain a deeper insight into the structure and diversity of the endophytic bacteria associated with \n\nH. portulacoides by combining information from culture-based and culture-independent \n\napproaches. \n\n \n\n2.4 Hypotheses \n\nThe following are hypotheses to be tested throughout the work: \n\nI. The endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides is a hotspot for bacterial diversity. \n\nII.

Endophytic bacteria promote plant \n\ngrowth and provide compounds with industrial applications. Nevertheless, information about \n\nendophytic bacteria from H. portulacoides is scarce. Endophytic isolates (n = 665) were obtained \n\nfrom aboveground and belowground plant tissues, from two Hg-contaminated sites (sites E and B) \n\nand a non-contaminated site (site C), in the estuary Ria de Aveiro. Representative isolates (n = 467) \n\nwere identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and subjected to functional assays. Isolates affiliated \n\nwith Proteobacteria (64 %), Actinobacteria (23 %), Firmicutes (10 %), and Bacteroidetes (3 %). \n\nAltererythrobacter (7.4 %), Marinilactibacillus (6.4 %), Microbacterium (10.2 %), Salinicola (8.8 %), \n\nand Vibrio (7.8 %) were the most abundant genera. Notably, Salinicola (n = 58) were only isolated \n\nfrom site C; Hoeflea (17), Labrenzia (22), and Microbacterium (67) only from belowground tissues. \n\nThis is the first report of Marinilactibacillus in the endosphere. Principal coordinate analysis showed \n\nthat community composition changes with the contamination gradient and tissue. Our results \n\nsuggest that the endosphere of H. portulacoides represents a diverse bacterial hotspot including \n\nputative novel species. Many isolates, particularly those affiliated to Altererythrobacter, \n\nMarinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, and Vibrio, tested positive for enzymatic activities and plant \n\ngrowth promoters, exposing H. portulacoides as a source of bacteria and compounds with \n\nbiotechnological applications. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nEndophyte, bacteria, Halimione portulacoides, salt marsh plants, plant growth promotion, \n\nextracellular enzymes \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nBackground \n\nSalt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in terms of primary production and are a \n\nhabitat to several species with commercial value (Alongi, 1998). The vegetation in this type of \n\necosystem is usually subjected to harsh environmental conditions including periodic tidal flooding, \n\nhigh salinity levels, and contaminants such as metals from urban and industrial effluents. As a \n\nconsequence, the typical salt marsh vegetation presents low species diversity and high \n\nspecialization (Woerner and Hackney, 1997).  \n\nRia de Aveiro, a costal lagoon on the northwest of Portugal, is one of the most mercury-\n\ncontaminated coastal systems in Portugal. For over four decades (1950\u20131994), industrial effluents \n\ncontaining mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and other contaminants were discharged \n\ninto natural water streams of this lagoon which led to contamination of water and sediments of \n\nadjacent marshes (Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Although discharges have substantially decreased \n\nover the last two decades, sediments in the Laranjo Bay salt marshes are still considerably \n\ncontaminated, namely with Hg. This highly toxic nonessential metal is a hazardous contaminant \n\nwith potential to be released to the water column and assimilated by the biota (Pereira et al., 2009).  \n\nThe perennial halophyte Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen is one of the most productive and \n\nabundant species in European salt marshes (Bouchard et al., 1998), including those along the Ria \n\nde Aveiro lagoon. This Hg-tolerant halophyte allocates this toxic metal preferably to belowground \n\ntissues and was proposed as a bioindicator and biomonitor for Hg pollution (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a). \n\nAdditionally, this halophyte has been proposed for phytoremediation of Hg (Anjum et al., 2011), \n\ntributyltin (Carvalho et al., 2010), and petroleum hydrocarbons (Couto et al., 2011). \n\nEndophytic bacteria colonize internal plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease \n\n(Lodewyckx et al., 2002). These bacteria are highly diverse taxonomically, ubiquitous from \n\nherbaceous plants to trees, and contribute to plant health and productivity (Berg et al., 2014). \n\nEndophytes present a great potential for applications in agricultural, medical, biotechnological, and \n\nindustrial fields. Industrially important enzymes such as amylases, cellulases, lipases, pectinases, \n\nproteases, and xylanases, among others, have previously been found in endophytic bacteria (e.g., \n\nLodewyckx et al., 2002). \n\nPlant-associated bacteria, including endophytic bacteria, are known to be very relevant for plant \n\ngrowth promotion (PGP; Hardoim et al. 2008), including in cases of biotic or abiotic stresses, such \n\nas contaminated soils (reviewed in Rajkumar et al., 2012). This PGP action may be conducted \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nthrough direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct PGP mechanisms include enhancement of plant \n\nnutrient acquisition, by aiding in nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization; plant growth by \n\nproduction of the auxin indol-3-acetic acid (IAA); and lowering of ethylene-related plant stress by \n\nproducing the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Indirect PGP is \n\nachieved by preventing phytopathogen prejudicial effects on plant development by producing \n\nmetabolites involved in antimicrobial activities and iron chelation (reviewed in Bulgarelli et al., \n\n2013). It is also known that plant-associated bacteria are able to aid in phytoremediation processes \n\nby phytoextraction (reviewed in Sessitsch et al., 2013). In fact, Oliveira et al. (2014a) have shown \n\nthat endophytic bacteria isolated from H. portulacoides have potential to be used in detoxification \n\nof petroleum hydrocarbons. \n\nNotwithstanding the acknowledged importance of endophytic bacteria, comprehensive studies \n\nregarding the basal culturable communities of these bacteria in the specific environment of salt \n\nmarshes are scarce, as studies are usually directed toward studying contaminant-degrading \n\nbacteria. Halimione portulacoides is a highly relevant and ecologically important halophyte in salt \n\nmarshes; however, the structure of endophytic bacterial communities of this plant has not yet been \n\nfully explored, only its fraction that is able to degrade hydrocarbons (Oliveira et al., 2014a).  \n\nThis study aimed to characterize the culturable endophytic bacterial communities of this halophyte \n\nfrom a highly contaminated site, an intermediately contaminated site, and a non-contaminated site \n\nin Ria de Aveiro, regarding their phylogenetic diversity and traits associated with direct and indirect \n\nPGP effects. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nMethods \n\nStudy Area and Sampling \n\nThe study was conducted in the estuary Ria de Aveiro, in Aveiro, Portugal. A confined area in this \n\nlagoon was subjected to Hg-rich industrial discharges for four decades (1950s\u20131990s, Pereira et al., \n\n1998). Three locations in the salt marsh of Ria de Aveiro were assessed: one highly contaminated \n\nby industrial activity (site B, 450 m downstream from the contamination source in the estuary, 40\u00b0 \n\n43? 47.46? N, 8\u00b0 36? 45.40? W), one with intermediate levels of contamination (site E, 2500 m \n\ndownstream from the contamination source, 40\u00b0 43? 15.90? N, 8\u00b0 38? 15.76? W) (V\u00e1lega et al., \n\n2008b), and a non-contaminated location (site C, 40\u00b0 38? 05.36? N, 8\u00b0 39? 38.87? W; 11.3 km from \n\nthe contamination source). Healthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides were sampled in \n\nmonospecific stands, at least in triplicate in each site. Adjacent sediment was sampled in triplicate \n\nwith a 3 cm in diameter and 13 cm depth corer. Sampling was performed during low tide in \n\nNovember 2012 (average temperature 16 \u00b0C). Samples were transported to the laboratory under \n\nrefrigerated conditions and promptly processed. \n\n \n\nMetal(loid) quantification \n\nComposite samples of aboveground (AG) tissues (leaves, stems, and flowers; 1 g fresh weight), \n\nbelowground (BG) tissues (roots; 1 g FW), and sediment (2 g FW) from each site were used for \n\nmetal(loid) quantification, in triplicate. Chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), As (as total \n\narsenic), and mercury (Hg) were quantified. Samples were subjected to acid digestion with \n\nconcentrated nitric acid overnight at 115 \u00b0C (Figueira and Freitas, 2013) and analyzed by inductively \n\ncoupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) according to the International Standard ISO 17294 by \n\na certified laboratory at the University of Aveiro. \n\nOne-way ANOVA (function aov) combined with post hoc Tukey\u2019s honest significant differences \n\nmethod (function TukeyHSD) were used to assess differences in metal(loid) concentrations in \n\nsediment and plant tissue samples on all sites. Welch two-sample t test (function t.test) was used \n\nto estimate differences in metal(loid) concentrations (i) among plant tissues, for each isolation site \n\nand (ii) between sediment and plant samples, for each isolation site. These analyses were \n\nperformed using the stats package in the free software R (R Core Team, 2014) with \n\nabovementioned functions aov, TukeyHSD, and t.test, considering a 95 % confidence interval. \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nIsolation of endophytic bacteria, growth media, and conditions \n\nEleven plants were processed at the laboratory: five from site C, three from site B, and three from \n\nsite E. First, all plants were thoroughly washed with tap water. For each plant, 5 g (FW) of AG tissues \n\nand 2 g (FW) of BG tissues were used for endophytic bacteria isolation. Surface sterilization was \n\noptimized and performed as follows: samples were sequentially immersed in 50 mL of phosphate-\n\nbuffered saline (PBS; 10 min), 96 % ethanol (1 min), 5 % NaOCl (30 min), 96 % ethanol (1 min), and \n\nrinsing in distilled sterile water three times. Surface sterilization was confirmed by inoculating water \n\nfrom the last wash in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), Marine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, \n\nFrance), and R2A (Merck, Germany) culture media. The plates were examined for bacterial growth \n\nafter incubation at 28 \u00b0C for 72 h. Tissues were then ground with a pestle in a mortar containing 10 \n\nmL of PBS. Serial dilutions were prepared in PBS and spread, in duplicate, on TSA, MA, and R2A \n\nmedia. The plates were incubated up to 72 h at 28 \u00b0C and were observed every 24 h for colony-\n\nforming unit (CFU) count. Morphologically distinct endophytic bacterial colonies were selected and \n\npurified by streaking, resulting in a collection of 665 endophytic bacterial isolates, and stored at ?80 \n\n\u00b0C in 20 % glycerol. Function aov combined with TukeyHSD was used to assess differences in average \n\nCFU per gram of tissue (fresh weight) in different isolation sites and culture media, and t.test was \n\nused to assess tissue-based differences. \n\n \n\nDNA extraction, PCR-based fingerprinting, and selection of representative isolates \n\nDNA from all 665 isolates was extracted using the Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo \n\nScientific, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. BOX-PCR with BOXA1 primer (5?-\n\nCTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGAC-3?; Versalovic et al., 1994) was used for molecular typing of all \n\nisolates. PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 25 ?L, using 5\u00d7 Green GoTaq buffer, GoTaq \n\nDNA polymerase (5U ?L?1), MgCl2 (25 mM), and a dNTP mixture (2 mM) (Promega, USA). Conditions \n\nfor amplification were as follows: one cycle at 95 \u00b0C (7 min), 30 cycles at 94 \u00b0C (1 min), 53 \u00b0C (1 min), \n\n65 \u00b0C (8 min), and a final cycle at 65 \u00b0C (16 min). One hundred thirty-three isolates did not yield a \n\nclear profile with this methodology and were typed using ERIC-PCR with ERIC1R (5?-\n\nATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3?; Versalovic et al., 1991) and ERIC2 (5?-\n\nAAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3?; Versalovic et al., 1991) primers. Conditions for PCR \n\namplification were the same as for BOX-PCR, except the annealing temperature, which was 52 \u00b0C. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nAnalysis of the genetic fingerprinting patterns was performed with GelCompar II software (Applied \n\nMaths, Belgium). The Pearson correlation coefficient was applied, and cluster analysis was \n\nperformed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm. The \n\nresulting dendrograms were analyzed in order to obtain groups of isolates with at least 85 % \n\nsimilarity. This cutoff was determined so that patterns that were known to be equal (molecular-\n\nweight size markers) would be considered to be in the same group. Representative isolates of each \n\ngroup were randomly selected. A total of 467 representative isolates were obtained: 419 from \n\nmolecular typing and 48 isolates that did not yield clear profiles by either BOX- or ERIC-PCR. \n\n \n\n16S rRNA gene amplification, phylogenetic affiliation, and multivariate analyses \n\nFour hundred sixty-seven representative isolates were subjected to PCR amplification of 16S rRNA \n\ngene using the universal primers 27f (5?-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3?; Lane, 1991) and 1492r (5?-\n\nGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3?; Lane, 1991) and the NZYTaq 2\u00d7 Green Master Mix (NZYTech, Portugal) \n\nin 25-?L reactions: one cycle at 94 \u00b0C (5 min), 30 cycles at 94 \u00b0C (1 min), 55 \u00b0C (1 min), 72 \u00b0C (1.5 \n\nmin), and a final cycle at 72 \u00b0C (10 min). Five isolates did not yield quality sequences after several \n\nattempts and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 462 amplification products were \n\npurified with the DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator \u2122-5 (Zymoresearch, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s \n\ninstructions. Amplicons were partially sequenced with primer 27f using GATC Biotech services \n\n(Germany) according to company specifications. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in \n\nthis study were submitted to GenBank and are available under the accession numbers KT324749 to \n\nKT325209. Quality sequences with an overall average of 893 bp were examined and edited with \n\nFinchTV V1.4.0 software (Geospiza, USA). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Altschul et \n\nal., 1997) and the EzTaxon server (Kim et al., 2012) were used to obtain taxonomic classification up \n\nto the genus level. Information from the representative isolates was used to associate taxonomic \n\naffiliation to the respective 658 isolates from the collection. Sequences were then subjected to the \n\nRibosomal Database Project (RDP) pyrosequencing pipeline (Cole et al., 2014), where they were \n\naligned and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) considering a distance limit of 0.03 \n\n(97 % similarity). Consequently, an OTU table was built with abundances for 21 samples: five for \n\nCAG\u2014community from AG tissues from site C; five for CBG\u2014BG tissues from site C; two for EAG\u2014\n\nAG tissues from site E; three for EBG\u2014BG tissues from site E; three for BAG\u2014AG tissues from site \n\nB; and three for BBG\u2014BG tissues from site B. Three AG samples were collected from site E; \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nhowever, only two yielded culturable bacteria. As such, only those were considered for subsequent \n\nanalyses. \n\nUsing R version 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2014), several analyses were performed to characterize the \n\nbacterial communities regarding their OTU abundance. Diversity indices Shannon\u2019s H? diversity and \n\nPielou\u2019s evenness were assessed with functions diversity and with diversity/log(specnumber), \n\nrespectively, from the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2015). The multipatt function from package \n\nindicspecies (De Caceres and Legendre, 2009) was used to find indicator species (here, OTUs) in \n\nsamples from different sites, tissues and communities, using a 10 % significance level for selecting \n\nindicators. The species-site group association parameter \u201cIndVal.g\u201d was used, since it corrects for \n\nunequal group sizes.  \n\nThe variation in OTU composition among the samples was analyzed by assessing differences in a \n\ndissimilarity matrix, built with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure (function vegdist from package \n\nvegan in R) after transforming the OTU abundance table with square root (function sqrt in R). \n\nPERMANOVA was used to analyze variances in the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the adonis \n\nfunction (from package vegan in R) on the interaction between isolation site and tissue, and to both \n\nvariables independently. For this analysis, the number of permutations was 999 in all tests.  \n\nInformation in the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was then graphically assessed with a principal \n\ncoordinate analysis (PCoA) using cmdscale function (from package vegan in R) to create the PCoA \n\nordination. The significance of the observed patterns in the PCoA was analyzed by assessing \n\ndifferences in sample scores across PCoA axis 1 (PCoA1) and PCoA axis 2 (PCoA2). The normality \n\ntest shapiro.test (stats package in R) revealed non-normality in PCoA1 (Shapiro-Wilk: W=0.8848, p-\n\nvalue &lt;0.05) and normality in PCoA2 (Shapiro-Wilk: W = 9352, p-value > 0.1). As a consequence, \n\npatterns in PCoA1 were assessed with Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (kruskal.test from stats package \n\nin R) combined with posthoc.kruskal.nemenyi.test (from PMCMR package in R; Pohlert 2005) for \n\nsamples from different sites and communities, and with Wilcoxon rank sum test (wilcox.test from \n\nstats package in R) for samples from different tissues. PCoA2 patterns were analyzed with aov for \n\nsamples from different sites and communities, and with t.test for samples from different tissues. \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nScreening of endophytic bacteria for enzymatic activity  \n\nThe 467 representative isolates were individually screened, in triplicate, for different enzymatic \n\nactivities: amylolytic, cellulolytic, lipolytic, pectinolytic (at pH 5.0 and 7.0), proteolytic, and \n\nxylanolytic. The ability of the isolates to degrade a substrate was evaluated using 0.2 % starch, 0.5 \n\n% carboxymethyl cellulose, 1 % Tween 20, 0.5 % pectin, 1 % skim milk, or 0.5 % xylan, respectively, \n\non TSA or MA culture medium. The basal culture medium (TSA or MA) was selected for each isolate, \n\naccording to where best bacterial growth was obtained. Tween 20 and skim milk solutions were \n\nsterilized separately and only added to the culture media after cooling down. The agar medium \n\nplates were inoculated with 5 ?L of a bacterial suspension with optical density (OD) at 600 nm=0.8 \n\nU and incubated at 30 \u00b0C until sufficient growth was obtained, or up to 120 h. The enzymatic \n\nactivities were assessed according to the presence (positive result) or absence (negative result) of \n\na halo surrounding the bacterial growth. Amylolytic activity was detected when a clear halo was \n\nobserved upon addition of Lugol solution to the agar plate. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities \n\nwere detected when a clear halo was observed upon incubation with a 1 % Congo red solution (with \n\n10 % ethanol) and subsequent wash with 1 M NaCl. Lipolytic activity was observed by the formation \n\nof a white precipitate around the bacterial growth. Pectinolytic activity was detected by formation \n\nof a clear halo after addition of 1 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. \n\nProteolytic activity was revealed by visualization of a clear halo against an opaque background. The \n\nresults were interpreted according to the visibility of the halo obtained: negative, no halo observed; \n\npositive, faint to intense halo observed. \n\n \n\nScreening of endophytic bacteria for plant growth promotion traits \n\nRepresentative isolates were individually screened for different PGP traits: ACC deaminase activity, \n\nIAA production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production. Isolates were incubated in \n\nadequate growth media at 30 \u00b0C until sufficient growth was obtained. Unless otherwise stated, \n\nstrains for negative and positive controls were studied in Pereira et al. (2013).  \n\nTo determine ACC deaminase activity, isolates were grown in DF salt minimal medium (Dworkin \n\nand Foster, 1958) or variations of this medium. Basal DF was prepared as follows (per liter): 4 g \n\nKH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 0.2 g MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 2 g glucose, 1 mg FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 10 ?g H3BO3, 10 ?g MnSO4, \n\n70 ?g ZnSO4, 50 ?g CuSO4, 10 ?g MoO3, 12 g agar, pH 7.2. This medium was either supplemented \n\nwith 3 mM ACC (DF + ACC; ACC was sterilized by filtration and added to cooled down medium) or 2 \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\ng L?1 (NH4)2SO4 (DF + ammonium sulfate) or no nitrogen source (DF). The ability to use ACC as a sole \n\nnitrogen source is a consequence of the activity of the enzyme ACC deaminase (Penrose and Glick, \n\n2003). Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Arthrobacter rombi EC32A were used as positive controls \n\nfor ACC deaminase activity. \n\nTo test for IAA production, the method of Gordon and Weber (1951) was used: for each isolate, 500 \n\n?L of supernatant obtained from cultures grown in MB or TSB + L?tryptophan (1 %) was mixed with \n\n1 mL of Salper solution. After incubating in the dark for 30 min, OD was read at 535 nm. Using a \n\ncalibration curve of pure IAA as a standard, IAA concentrations (?g mL?1) were obtained for each \n\nisolate. Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Pseudomonas fluorescens S3X were used as positive \n\ncontrols for IAA production. \n\nThe ability of isolates to solubilize phosphate was screened on National Botanical Research \n\nInstitute\u2019s Phosphate (NBRIP) solid growth medium (Nautiyal, 1999). After inoculation and \n\nappropriate incubation, phosphate solubilization was observed as a clear halo surrounding the \n\nbacterial growth. Pseudomonas reactans EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, and P. \n\nfluorescens S3X were used as negative controls for phosphate solubilization, and Arthrobacter \n\nnicotinovorans EAPAA and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls.  \n\nIn order to test for siderophore production, all glass materials used were deferrated by treating \n\nwith 6 % nitric acid and extensively washing with sterile double distilled water. Culture media \n\ndeferration was conducted on TSA and MA medium as described by Cox (1994). After inoculation \n\nand incubation on either medium, the plates with bacterial growth were overlaid with CAS (O?CAS; \n\nP\u00e9rez?Miranda et al., 2007) and incubated with this overlay for 2 h. Siderophore production was \n\ndetected as a change of color of the overlay from blue to orange or purple. This assay was only \n\nperformed with TSA medium, since the O?CAS reacted with MA medium preventing a clear reading \n\nof the result. Pseudomonas reactans EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, P. fluorescens S3X, \n\nA. nicotinovorans EAPAA, and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls for siderophore \n\nproduction. \n\nThe representative isolates were also assessed for their nitrogen fixing abilities by PCR?screening \n\nfor the presence of nifH gene: the primers IGK3 and DVV (Ando et al., 2005), described as the best \n\npair of primers to use in nifH amplification (Gaby and Buckley, 2012) were used with the NZYTaq 2\u00d7 \n\nGreen Master Mix (NZYTech, Portugal) in 25 ?L reactions. Conditions for PCR amplification were as \n\nfollows: initial denaturing at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 \u00b0C for 45 s, \n\nannealing at 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extending at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. A final extension was performed at 72 \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n\u00b0C for 10 min. Rahnella aquatilis M72troncoD (HQ538817; Proen\u00e7a et al., 2010) was used as a \n\npositive control, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a negative control (Gaby and Buckley, \n\n2012). The resulting PCR products were observed in a 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nResults \n\nMetal(loid) quantification of sediments and plant tissue \n\nFive metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Hg) and the metalloid As were quantified from samples collected at \n\nsites C, E, and B, in sediment samples from monospecific stands of H. portulacoides, in AG and BG \n\ntissues. The results are presented in Table 3.1. For some replicates of Hg concentration \n\ndetermination in sites C and E, the obtained values were below detection limits (&lt;2 ?g L?1).

For As and Hg, a contamination \n\ngradient could be observed, where site B (closest to the effluent discharge) had the most \n\ncontaminated sediment samples and site E presented intermediate contamination (p?value &lt;0.05). \n\nRemarkably, sediment Hg concentration was, on average, 31 (site E) to 135 (site B) times higher \n\nthan in samples from site C. All sediment samples were more contaminated than plant tissue \n\nsamples, in all sites, for all tested metal(loid)s (p?value &lt;0.05), except Hg in site C, where the \n\ndifferences in the metal concentration did not present statistical significance. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nConsidering metal(loid) contents in each site separately, we observed that in site B, metal(loid)s \n\nconcentration in AG tissues were significantly lower than that in BG tissues. The same was observed \n\nfor Ni in site E (p?value &lt;0.05). Remarkably, Hg contamination of BG tissues in site B was 33?fold \n\nhigher than in site C.  \n\nConsidering metal(loid) contents in each type of tissue separately, we saw that BG tissues were \n\nsignificantly more contaminated with Cr, Ni, and Hg in site B than in site C. In the specific cases of \n\nAs in AG tissues and Hg in both tissues, a significant gradient was observed: C &lt;E &lt;B (p?value &lt;\n\n0.05). \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic diversity of endophytic bacteria, community structure, and multivariate analyses \n\nEndophytic bacteria from sites C, E, and B were isolated from surface sterilized AG and BG tissues \n\nfrom eleven plants, in TSA, MA, and R2A culture media. Extensive results for CFU g?1 (FW) for all \n\nsampled plants are stated in Supplementary Table S3.1. AG tissues from site C presented \n\nsignificantly more CFU g?1 than BG tissues (p?value &lt;0.05). The opposite was observed in sites E (p?\n\nvalue &lt;0.05) and B (only for TSA culture medium; p?value &lt;0.05).  \n\nThe selection of morphologically distinct colonies from all culture media, plant tissues, and sampling \n\nsites resulted in a collection of 665 endophytic isolates. Molecular typing of the collection yielded \n\n467 representative isolates (150 from CAG community, 74 from CBG, 18 from EAG, 94 from EBG, \n\n33 from BAG, and 97 from BBG), for which partial sequences of 16S rRNA gene were obtained. Five \n\nisolates did not yield quality sequences after several attempts and were excluded from the analysis, \n\nresulting in 462 amplification products. Taxonomic classification yielded matches with similarity \n\nranging from 92.79 to 100 % similarity. Twenty?nine of 462 isolates (6.3 %) exhibited an identity \n\npercentage lower than 97 with the closest match, suggesting the potential for novel species in the \n\ncollection. Taxonomic information was then affiliated to the respective 658 isolates. \n\n \n\nThe 658 isolates were distributed amongst class?level identification and grouped according to \n\nisolation site and tissue in Figure 3.1. The phylum Proteobacteria (mainly classes \n\nAlphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) clearly dominated the collection of endophytic \n\nbacteria (64.29 % of 658 isolates; Figure 3.1 and Supplementary Table S3.2), followed by \n\nActinobacteria (22.8%) and Firmicutes (10.33%). The phylum Bacteroidetes was also present, but \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nless represented (2.58 %). Figure 3.1 also shows that Alphaproteobacteria are highly represented \n\nin all six communities, and that Gammaproteobacteria, although present in all communities, are \n\nmost abundant in site C. Isolates from classes Bacilli and Actinobacteria are present in all \n\ncommunities, except Actinobacteria in the community with the lower number of isolates (EAG, 22 \n\nisolates). \n\nThe most common families of bacteria in the collection were Vibrionaceae (51 of 658 isolates, 7.75 \n\n%) Microbacteriaceae (85/658 isolates, 12.92 %), Erythrobacteraceae (87/658 isolates, 13.22 %), \n\nand Halomonadaceae (98/658 isolates, 14.89 %). The complete distribution of the 658 isolates \n\nacross 79 genera in all six communities is presented in Supplementary Table S3.2. Overall, the most \n\nabundant genera were Altererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, Salinicola, and \n\nVibrio, with 49, 42, 67, 58, and 51 isolates, respectively. Altererythrobacter was the only genus \n\npresent in all six communities. Isolates belonging to the genera Altererythrobacter, Bacillus, \n\nCitromicrobium, Demequina, Labrenzia, Marinilactibacillus, Martelella, Microbacterium, \n\nMicrococcus, Pseudomonas, Sphingorabdus, Stakelama, Vibrio, and Zunongwangia were present in \n\nall sites. Isolates belonging to 29 of the 79 genera were present in both BG and AG tissues. \n\nNotably, all 58 isolates (8.8 % of the collection) associated with the genus Salinicola were exclusively \n\nisolated from site C. Hoeflea, Labrenzia, and Microbacterium were exclusive and considerably \n\ndominant in BG tissues, with 17 (2.6 % of the collection), 22 (3.3 %), and 67 (10.2 %) isolates, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nAn OTU table was built with abundances across all samples, using the RDP pyrosequencing pipeline. \n\nThe OTUs were defined considering a distance limit of 0.03 (97 % similarity) and their distribution \n\nacross communities is stated in Table 3.2. Analysis of indicator OTUs showed that the OTUs, here \n\nannotated with the corresponding genera, that contributed most for the characterization of each \n\nsampling site were as follows: OTU_005 (Salinicola spp., 58 isolates, p?value &lt;0.05) for site C, and \n\nOTU_077 (Bacillus spp., 11 isolates, p?value &lt;0.05) and OTU_028 (Rhizobium spp., 6 isolates, p?\n\nvalue &lt;0.05) for site B. This analysis also showed that indicator OTUs for the isolation tissue were \n\nas follows: OTU_104 (Zunongwangia spp., 5 isolates, p?value &lt;0.05) for AG tissues, and OTU_033 \n\n(Labrenzia spp., 22 isolates, p?value &lt;0.05) and OTU_219 (Microbacterium spp., 44 isolates, p?value \n\n&lt;0.05) for BG tissues. \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Distribution of 658 endophytic isolates by class amongst isolation sites (B, E and C) and plant \n\ntissues.

The resulting matrix was tested for \n\nsignificant differences with PERMANOVA (adonis function in R). The interaction between isolation \n\nsite and tissue was significant (adonis: F2,15= 1.38, R2 = 0.12, p?value &lt;0.05), as was the test for each \n\nindependent variable: isolation site (adonis: F2,18 = 1.65, R2 = 0.14, p?value &lt;0.01) and tissue (adonis: \n\nF1,19 = 2.08, R2 = 0.09, p?value &lt;0.01). However, only 23 % of the variation in the bacterial \n\ncomposition was explained by both variables and 12 % by their interaction. \n\nA PCoA plot was generated based on the Bray?Curtis dissimilarity matrix to compare all bacterial \n\ncommunities (Figure 3.2). The PCoA plot shows a clear gradient across axis PCoA1 which coincides \n\nwith the presence of contamination, as samples with most contamination (BG tissues from sites B \n\nand E, see Table 3.1) are grouped in the left side of the plot. Analysis of sample scores across PCoA1 \n\nrevealed that there are significant differences in OTU composition in isolation sites (Kruskal?Wallis \n\nchi?squared = 7.66, df = 2, p?value &lt;0.05) and in isolation tissues (Wilcoxon rank sum test: W= 93, \n\np?value &lt;0.01). This was not observed in PCoA2 for either isolation sites (ANOVA: F2,18= 2.53, p?\n\nvalue > 0.1) nor tissues (t test: t =?1.8, df=14.97, p?value > 0.05).  \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nTable 3.2 Analysis of 16S rRNA gene partial sequences with RDP pipeline.

From the 97 isolates that \n\ntested positive for nifH amplification, 74 belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum, including 19 Vibrio \n\nsp. isolates. The most noteworthy genera were Altererythrobacter (from the 31 isolates of this \n\ngenus, 29 were lipolytic and 24 xylanolytic, 22 presented both of these activities), \n\nMarinilactibacillus (24 cellulolytic, 18 proteolytic and 39 xylanolytic isolates, out of 41 isolates from \n\nthis genus), Microbacterium (32 amylolytic, 30 cellulolytic and 29 xylanolytic isolates, from 39 \n\nMicrobacterium sp. isolates), and Vibrio (14 isolates producing every enzyme tested, from a total \n\nof 33 Vibrio sp. isolates). Isolates associated to five genera (one Altererythrobacter, one Ensifer, one \n\nOceanibulbus, one Stakelama, and two Vibrio) displayed positive results for all tested PGP traits \n\nassays (Supplementary Table S3.3). \n\n \n\nThe community?based and class?level distribution of representative isolates that tested positive for \n\nthe assayed enzymatic activities and PGP traits are represented in Figure 3.3 and Supplementary \n\nFigure S3.1, respectively. The class?level distribution of isolates that tested positive in all assayed \n\nenzymatic activities and PGPs was a reflection of the class?level and community?based distribution \n\nof all isolates of our collection (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.2, respectively), i.e., the classes with higher \n\nrepresentability in the endophytic collection were also those that presented more isolates that \n\ntested positive for the assayed enzymes and traits. This suggests that the probability of the \n\npresence of traits in a given class depends on the number of isolates in that class, instead of \n\ndepending on the site or tissue of isolation. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Distribution of isolates that tested positive for enzymatic activity assays and plant growth \n\npromotion traits from 467 representative isolates.

To our knowledge, \n\nthis is the first study regarding the isolation, identification, and functional characterization of \n\nendophytic bacteria in healthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides. Bacteria were isolated \n\nfrom AG and BG tissues from the halophyte, collected from two sites contaminated with industrial \n\neffluents and one non-contaminated control site. Several authors have verified that a gradient of \n\ncontamination exists, from Laranjo Bay to nearshore, especially regarding sediment Hg \n\ncontamination (reviewed in Pereira et al., 2009). In the present study, sediment samples presented \n\nhigher metal(loid) contents in sites closest to the industrial effluent discharges (sites B and E). In \n\nfact, for As and Hg, a significant concentration gradient could be observed, where content in B > E \n\n> C. These metal(loid)s were among the known main contaminants in the industrial effluents in \n\nLaranjo Bay, as is stated in the report by Costa and Jesus-Rydin (2001).  \n\nSeveral studies have found that H. portulacoides mainly accumulates metals in the BG tissues and \n\nthat BG to AG translocation is very low (e.g., V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a; V\u00e1lega et al., 2008b; Anjum et al., \n\n2011). The same pattern was observed in BG and AG tissues in this study, for all tested metals in \n\nsite B (up to 6 times more metal content than in AG tissues) and for Ni in site E (average of 4.5 times \n\nmore Ni in BG than in AG tissues). This allocation pattern was described by Lozano-Rodriguez et al. \n\n(1997) as a strategy for protecting the more sensitive AG tissues from the effects of metal-induced \n\nstress.  \n\nWe analyzed a much higher number of isolates than what is usually observed in studies focusing \n\nendophytic bacteria. This could be attributed to the fact that we used three culture media with \n\ndifferent nutritional compositions and that the plate incubation period for the isolation of the \n\nendophytic bacteria was long (72 h). Sample sizes were considerably smaller for EAG and BAG \n\ncommunities and, as a consequence of this unbalance dataset, analyzing indicator OTUs may raise \n\nconcerns. However, when using the parameter \u201cIndVal.g\u201d in the indicspecies package in R, there is \n\na correction for unequal group sizes in the calculations for indicator species (OTUs in our case). The \n\nquantity \u201cA,\u201d used in calculating the IndVal, is obtained by using the mean abundance of the species \n\nin the target site group divided by the sum of the mean abundance values over all groups. In using \n\nthe sum of the mean abundance values over all groups, instead of using real abundances from all \n\ngroups, the unequal sizes of the site groups are controlled for (De Caceres and Legendre, 2009). \n\nRegarding the statistical analysis performed based on a dissimilarity measure (Bray-Curtis), we \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nminimized the most relevant intrinsic bias of this measure (giving too much importance to dominant \n\nOTUs and overseeing rare ones) by applying a square root transformation to our OTU abundance \n\ntable prior to obtaining the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The selection of the index at hand was \n\nbased on (i) its applicability to assess differences between communities using abundance data, (ii) \n\nits wide use in the field of ecology and microbiology for this purpose, and (iii) its suitability to answer \n\nour questions.  \n\nWe found considerable culturable bacterial diversity in the internal tissues of H. portulacoides from \n\nall sampled sites. It is widely accepted that the culturable fraction of plant-associated microbes \n\ncorresponds to a small fraction of the real diversity, as a consequence of growth medium \n\ninadequacy (Tanaka et al., 2014), and limitations to reproduce optimal growth conditions. \n\nNevertheless, the culture-dependent approach allows for extensive functional characterization of \n\nthe isolates in the collection, which is not possible with culture-independent approaches. \n\nAdditionally, traditional methods of culture-dependent techniques are useful for the determination \n\nof the overall effect of metal contaminants in bacterial communities (Ellis et al., 2001). \n\nAs stated above, in our study, the number of isolates obtained from EAG and BAG samples was \n\nconsiderably lower than for other samples. Since the method for obtaining endophytic bacteria \n\nincludes a harsh surface sterilization process, the viability of endophytes in the samples could be \n\ncompromised. However, we do not believe this to be the main reason for such a disparity in the \n\nnumber of isolates in the different samples, since the same process was applied to all samples. The \n\nisolation efforts were the same for all samples, and as such, the difference in numbers of obtained \n\nendophytic isolates may be a reflection of these AG tissues being less populated, since the highest \n\nbacterial densities are usually observed in BG tissues, and decrease toward AG tissues (Lodewyckx \n\net al., 2002). In fact, we observed a significantly lower average number of CFU per gram (FW) \n\nobtained from EAG and BAG samples, when compared with the respective BG tissues \n\n(Supplementary Table S3.1). This pattern was not, however, observed for AG and BG tissues from \n\nsite C, where the CAG community presented a significantly higher average number of CFU per gram \n\n(FW) than CBG. This suggests that the degree of soil and plant tissue contamination could also play \n\na role in the average number of culturable bacteria. This latter effect has been previously reported \n\nfor bacterial soil communities, where the presence of metal contaminants negatively influenced \n\nthe ability of readily culturable bacteria to replicate in laboratory media (Ellis et al., 2003). \n\nProteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the phyla recognized in the \n\nendophytic collection from this study. This result is in accordance with studies describing the \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nphyllosphere and endosphere assemblages in other plant hosts (reviewed in Bulgarelli et al., 2013), \n\nincluding halophytes (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015), and the rhizosphere of H. portulacoides (Oliveira et \n\nal., 2014b). The genera Altererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, Salinicola, and \n\nVibrio were the most abundant in our collection. To our knowledge, this is the first time an isolate \n\nbelonging to the genus Marinilactibacillus was obtained from the endosphere. \n\nIsolates affiliated to the genus Altererythrobacter have been previously identified in the \n\nendosphere (e.g., Liu et al., 2014). In our collection, 73.5 % of isolated Altererythrobacter spp. were \n\ncollected from contaminated sites (E and B). Some species of Altererythrobacter are described as \n\nable to tolerate metals (Wu et al., 2014), a trait that could be useful in the endosphere of plants \n\ncolonizing contaminated locations. \n\nMarinilactibacillus spp. have been detected in marine environments (e.g., Toffin et al., 2005) and \n\ndetected with culture-independent methods in olive fermentation brine (Lucena-Padr\u00f3s et al., \n\n2015). Isolates belonging to this genus have also been isolated from many types of cheese, including \n\nas part of consortia that were able to reduce the counts of the human pathogen Listeria \n\nmonocytogenes (e.g., Roth et al., 2010), indicating antimicrobial activities which could be useful in \n\nthe endosphere environment.  \n\nIsolates from the genus Microbacterium, exclusively isolated from BG tissues in this study, have \n\nbeen thoroughly characterized and detected in many environments, including the rhizosphere of \n\nginseng (Kim et al., 2015) and the endosphere of crops and prairie plants (Zinniel et al., 2002). \n\nRecently, three novel species from this genus were described from the endosphere of H. \n\nportulacoides (Alves et al., 2014; Alves et al., 2015). PGP traits have been previously associated with \n\nthis genus (see below), suggesting a high importance in the endosphere. \n\nIsolates from the genus Salinicola have been previously obtained from diverse environments (e.g., \n\ndeep sea surface sediments, Romanenko et al., 2013) including the endosphere of a halophyte \n\n(Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge, PGP traits have not been explored in this \n\ngenus. The prosperity of Salinicola spp. in marine environments could be related to their presence \n\nin the endosphere of the halophyte at study.  \n\nVibrio spp. have been abundantly detected in aquatic environments and organisms (Thompson et \n\nal., 2004) and in the endosphere (e.g., seagrass, Jose et al., 2014). PGP traits have been associated \n\nwith this genus (see below), suggesting that this widely known pathogen in humans and other \n\nanimals may have a positive role in the endosphere. \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nThe genera Pseudomonas and Micrococcus, less represented in this study (15 and 9 isolates, \n\nrespectively), were previously detected in the endosphere of H. portulacoides in a study regarding \n\nhydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Oliveira et al., 2014a). \n\nFrom the 462 identified isolates, 29 presented less than 97 % similarity with the closest 16S rRNA \n\ngene sequence in GenBank. These isolates may potentially belong to novel species, revealing the \n\nendosphere of H. portulacoides as a source for undescribed phylogenetic groups. \n\nAs reviewed in Bulgarelli et al. (2013) for many plant hosts and discussed in Oliveira et al. (2014b) \n\nfor H. portulacoides, plant-related factors contribute to the composition of plant-associated \n\nbacterial communities. In this work, 14 genera were isolated from all sites, suggesting the presence \n\nof a common structure associated to the studied halophyte. On the other hand, differences were \n\nobserved, where considerably abundant genera were exclusively isolated from one site (e.g., \n\nSalinicola spp. from site C).  \n\nIn the present study, Altererythrobacter spp., Marinilactibacillus spp., Microbacterium spp., and \n\nVibrio spp. isolates were abundantly detected in all sites, suggesting an ability to tolerate metals, \n\nwhich has been previously described in these genera (Wu et al., 2014; Sheng et al., 2008; Jafari et \n\nal., 2015) except, to the best of our knowledge, for the genus Marinilactibacillus. OTUs belonging \n\nto the genera Bacillus and Rhizobium, albeit less represented in the endophyte collection (11 and 6 \n\nisolates, respectively), were considered indicator OTUs for site B, and metal tolerance has \n\npreviously been associated with these genera (Ma et al., 2015; Aafi et al., 2015). Isolates belonging \n\nto Salinicola spp. (n=58) were exclusively detected in site C, and the indicator OTU for site C was \n\nalso attributed to this genus. Information on whether Salinicola spp. can tolerate metal \n\ncontamination is lacking in the literature; however, considering the number of isolates obtained \n\nfrom this genus and the extension of our collection, we suggest that it should be further \n\ninvestigated as to its ability as a bioindicator. \n\nUsually, bacteria access plant tissues through natural entry points in the root tips and lateral roots \n\nemergence points, as a consequence of root growth. Once inside the plant, endophytes may \n\ncolonize the plant by migration from BG to AG tissues. Additional penetration may occur through \n\nnatural openings on leaves such as stomata, or through leaf wounds (reviewed in Lodewyckx et al., \n\n2002). Here, we found that BG and AG tissues shared 20 bacterial genera, suggesting that migration \n\nfrom BG to AG tissues may occur in H. portulacoides. On the other hand, isolates belonging to the \n\ngenera Hoeflea (17), Labrenzia (22), and Microbacterium (67) were only isolated from BG tissues, \n\nand the two latter genera were identified as indicator OTUs for these tissues by our indicator \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nspecies analysis. The genera Hoeflea and Labrenzia have been isolated from root endosphere of a \n\nsalt marsh halophyte (Bibi et al., 2014) and, to the best of our knowledge, have not been detected \n\nin AG tissues of plants, as was the case in our study. On the other hand, Microbacterium spp. has \n\nbeen detected in AG tissues of H. portulacoides (e.g., Alves et al., 2014). An OTU attributed to the \n\ngenus Zunongwangia was considered indicator OTU for AG tissues in our analysis. Although this \n\ngenus has been isolated from the rhizosphere of mangrove trees (Rameshkumar et al., 2014) and \n\ndetected by pyrosequencing in the endosphere (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015), it had not been previously \n\nisolated in the endosphere. \n\nWe found that the bacterial composition across our collection is significantly affected by the \n\nisolation site and tissue, although these factors only account for 23 % of the total variation observed \n\nin our data. Nevertheless, a variation in composition could be observed across the gradient of \n\ncontamination in our sampling sites, suggesting that the contamination levels do, in fact, affect the \n\ncomposition of the culturable endosphere of H. portulacoides. Other variation parameters (e.g., soil \n\nwater content, organic matter content, fine particle content, redox potential, pH, and conductivity; \n\nV\u00e1lega et al., 2008b) could be explored in order to further understand the reasons for composition \n\nvariation in the culturable endosphere of this halophyte. \n\nMany isolates from the collection obtained in this study tested positive for several enzymatic \n\nactivities and PGP traits, exposing the endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides as a novel \n\nsource of bacteria and bacterial compounds with potential biotechnological applications. The ability \n\nto produce these extracellular enzymes and PGP traits is well distributed across phylogenetic \n\ngroups, as the most represented classes (Figure 3.1) amply exhibited all tested traits, except Bacilli \n\nfor phosphate solubilization (Supplementary Figure S3.1). This ability is also well represented, \n\noverall, in all isolation sites and tissues (Figure 3.3). The ability to produce industrially important \n\nextracellular enzymes was abundantly detected in isolates associated to the genera \n\nAltererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, and Vibrio. To our knowledge, the \n\nproduction of the tested enzymes had not been previously described in Altererythrobacter spp. and \n\nMarinilactibacillus spp. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the PGP traits tested in the presented study were not previously \n\nevaluated in Altererythrobacter spp. isolates. Here, we found that isolates from this genus tested \n\npositive for one to six extracellular enzymatic activities and presented one to five PGP traits. Overall, \n\nall tested enzymes and traits were produced by isolates belonging to his genus. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nTraits for Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates from other studies have not been deeply characterized. \n\nHere, we found that Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates tested positive for one to five extracellular \n\nenzymatic activities, and presented one to four PGP traits. Considering all the isolates from this \n\ngenus, all of the tested enzymes and traits were produced, except pectinase at pH 5. \n\nThe ability to promote plant growth has been previously detected in the genus Microbacterium \n\nwith traits as ACC deaminase (Sheng et al., 2008), IAA production, phosphate solubilization (Kukla \n\net al., 2014), and siderophore production (Pereira et al., 2013). The presence of the nifH gene was \n\nalso detected (Zakhia et al., 2006). Production of protease and lipase (Pereira et al., 2013), xylanase, \n\namylase (Park et al., 2006), cellulase (Kukla et al., 2014), and pectinase (Vinod et al., 2014) has been \n\ncharacterized in Microbacterium spp.. Antimicrobial activity and resistance to metals have also \n\nbeen reported in this genus (Sheng et al., 2008; Passari et al., 2015). In the present study, one to \n\nfive of the abovementioned extracellular enzymes were also detected in all Microbacterium spp. \n\nisolates, as were one to four PGP traits. Considering all the isolates from this genus, all of the tested \n\nenzymes and traits were present. \n\nPreviously studied Vibrio spp. exhibited enzymatic activities such as proteolytic, cellulolytic, \n\namylolytic (Jose et al., 2014), xylanolytic (Kiyohara et al., 2005), and lipolytic (Ray et al., 2012), \n\nshowed potential for plant growth promotion by solubilizing phosphate, fixing atmospheric \n\nnitrogen, producing IAA (Jose et al., 2014), and siderophores (Thompson et al., 2004). Vibrio spp. \n\nisolates from our collection tested positive for these activities and traits and, in addition, \n\npectinolytic activity (at both pH=5.0 and 7.0) and ACC deaminase activity. Other studies have also \n\ndetected antimicrobial activity (Kumar and Nair, 2007) and considerable Hg resistance and ability \n\nfor Hg bioremediation in Vibrio spp. isolates (Jafari et al., 2015). \n\nIAA production was detected in 460 isolates, 17 of which produced over 100 ?g mL?1. The most \n\nrepresented IAA producing genus is Pseudomonas with five isolates, which has previously been \n\nassociated with IAA producing potential in rice root exudates (Karnwal, 2009). Phosphate \n\nsolubilization was detected in 64 isolates, 10 of which belong to the genus Microbacterium, and 15 \n\nbelong to the genus Salinicola. While Microbacterium spp. have been associated with phosphate \n\nsolubilizing activity (Kukla et al., 2014), this is, to our knowledge, the first report of such activity in \n\nthe Salinicola genus. Using PCR amplification, 20.8 % of representative isolates tested positive for \n\nthe presence of the nifH gene. Of the 97 nifH-positive isolates, 63 originated from BG tissues and \n\n17 belonged to the genus Vibrio, which has previously been associated with this trait (Jose et al., \n\n2014). According to Penrose and Glick (2003), the ability to use ACC as a sole nitrogen source is a \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nconsequence of the activity of the enzyme ACC deaminase. From the 239 isolates that were able to \n\ngrow in DF minimal medium supplemented with ACC, 155 (64.9 %) originated from BG tissues, and \n\n60 % of isolates sampled in site B tested positive for this activity. Isolates associated with the genera \n\nMicrobacterium (33) and Altererythrobacter (25) contributed the most for this PGP trait. Isolates \n\nfrom Microbacterium genus have previously been associated with ACC deaminase activity (Sheng \n\net al., 2008); however, to our knowledge, this is the first description of such activity in the genus \n\nAltererythrobacter. Siderophore production was observed in 152 isolates (32.5 % of the collection), \n\n19 of which belong to the genus Vibrio, which had been previously linked to this activity (Thompson \n\net al., 2004). Nineteen Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates also tested positive, which is, to our \n\nknowledge, the first time such activity was described in this genus. \n\nThis work revealed that the endosphere of H. portulacoides represents a bacterial hotspot \n\nharboring a diverse microbiota, including putative novel species and compounds with \n\nbiotechnological relevance. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from AG and BG tissues of the \n\nhalophyte from contaminated and non-contaminated sites. Seventy-nine different genera were \n\nfound using traditional cultivation methods. The phylogenetically diverse collection presented \n\nstructural differences among sampling tissues and sites, and many of the isolates revealed their \n\nability to produce extracellular enzymes and PGP traits. The PGP potential of these endophytes \n\nshould be further characterized, aiming toward enhancing phytoextraction of metal-contaminated \n\nsoils by H. portulacoides. The possibility of monitoring Salinicola spp. as a bioindicator of lack of \n\ncontamination should also be further studied. Metal resistance and antimicrobial properties of \n\nthese isolates should also be assessed to further characterize functional capabilities of the \n\ncollection. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was financed by the European Funds through COMPETE and by National Funds through the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) within project PhytoMarsh (PTDC/AAC-\n\nAMB/118873/2010\u2013FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-019328).

The main goal of this study was to characterize endophytic \n\nPseudomonas isolated from Halimione portulacoides, a metal-accumulator plant, in salt marshes \n\ncontaminated with metal(loid)s. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes showed \n\nthat isolates affiliated with P. sabulinigri (n = 16), P. koreensis (n = 10), P. simiae (n = 5), P. \n\nseleniipraecipitans (n = 2), P. guineae (n = 2), P. migulae (n = 1), P. fragi (n = 1), P. xanthomarina (n \n\n= 1), and Pseudomonas sp. (n = 1). Most of these species have never been described as endophytic. \n\nThe majority of the isolates were resistant to three or more metal(loid)s. Antibiotic resistance was \n\nfrequent among the isolates but most likely related to species-intrinsic features. Common acquired \n\nantibiotic resistance genes and integrons were not detected. Plasmids were detected in 43.6 % of \n\nthe isolates. Isolates that affiliated with different species shared the same plasmid profile but \n\nattempts to transfer metal resistance to receptor strains were not successful. Phosphate \n\nsolubilization and IAA production were the most prevalent plant growth promoting traits, and 20 % \n\nof the isolates showed activity against phytopathogenic bacteria. Most isolates produced four or \n\nmore extracellular enzymes. Preliminary results showed that two selected isolates promote \n\nArabidopsis thaliana root elongation. Results highlight the diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas in \n\nH. portulacoides from contaminated sites and their potential to assist phytoremediation by acting \n\nas plant growth promoters and as environmental detoxifiers. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nPseudomonas, Halimione portulacoides, endophytic, phytoremediation, plant growth promoters, \n\nmetals \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nBackground \n\nThe contamination of different aquatic and terrestrial settings with metals is a complex and difficult \n\nto handle environmental problem (Cambroll\u00e9 et al., 2012a; Rajkumar et al., 2009; Singh and \n\nCameotra, 2004). Metal pollution is of major concern for human health due to the persistence of \n\nthese elements in the environment for long periods, resulting in continuous negative impacts on \n\necosystems (Rajkumar et al., 2009; Singh and Cameotra, 2004). \n\nSalt marshes are one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth. Nevertheless, these ecosystems \n\nare recipients of industrial and municipal waste, accumulating considerable amounts of \n\ncontaminants, including metals (Duarte et al., 2007; Mucha et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2008). \n\nThe strategies available to solve the problem of metal contamination include phytoremediation. \n\nThis technique is considered effective, less expensive, and less damaging than, for example, \n\nchemical and physical remediation strategies (Almeida et al., 2009; Mucha et al., 2011; Weyens et \n\nal., 2009). Plants used in phytoremediation should have specific features, such as fast growth, and \n\ndense root and shoot systems. The phytoremediation of metal-contaminated sites is possible since \n\nsome plants tolerate and accumulate high amounts of metals (Rajkumar et al., 2009). Halimione \n\nportulacoides is one of the most predominant and productive plants in European salt marshes and \n\nis already used in phytoremediation (Anjum et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 2010; Couto et al., 2011). \n\nThis plant has been reported as an accumulator of several metals and it has been proposed as \n\nbiomonitor for mercury (Hg) contamination (Cambroll\u00e9 et al., 2012a, b; V\u00e1lega et al., 2008a).  \n\nThe phytoremediation potential of a given plant also depends on the bacterial communities that \n\nlive in association with it. Bacteria that are present in the phytosphere may contribute to \n\nphytoremediation through mechanisms that enhance plant establishment, proliferation, and health \n\nin a polluted environment. Beneficial effects provided by bacteria include increased metal \n\ntolerance, production of plant growth promoters (PGP), and antimicrobial activity against \n\nphytopathogens (Rajkumar et al., 2009). The contribution may be more direct since, for instance, \n\nsome bacteria can modify the metals and thus facilitate absorption by the plant (Aguilar-Barajas et \n\nal., 2010; Ullah et al., 2015).  \n\nThe genus Pseudomonas includes bacteria that can be found in a variety of ecological niches such \n\nas soil, water, and in association with plants and animals (Spiers et al., 2000). Pseudomonas spp. \n\nare a highly diverse and adaptable group, including human pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas \n\naeruginosa; Poole, 2011) and plant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae; Tarkowski and \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nVereecke, 2014). Association of Pseudomonas strains with plants has been referred as beneficial \n\nthrough their PGP effect (Ganeshan and Kumar, 2005). Despite this, endophytic Pseudomonas have \n\nbeen poorly explored regarding their potential to promote bioremediation when associated with \n\nplants. \n\nThe objective of this study was to characterize endophytic Pseudomonas isolates of H. portulacoides \n\nfrom salt marshes contaminated with metals. Isolates were comprehensively characterized with \n\nrespect to their phylogenetic diversity, PGP effect, and resistance/tolerance to metals and \n\nantibiotics. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nMethods \n\nEndophytic Pseudomonas strains \n\nA collection of endophytic bacterial isolates was obtained in the scope of previous investigations \n\n(Fidalgo et al., 2016; Martins, 2011). Bacterial isolates were retrieved from above (AG) and \n\nbelowground (BG) tissues of H. portulacoides in metal-contaminated salt marshes (sites B and E) of \n\nthe estuary Ria de Aveiro in the northwest coast of Portugal. Previous studies have shown that site \n\nB, being closest to the industrial effluent discharge point, showed higher metal(loid)s content than \n\nsite E (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008b). Bacterial isolation methodology is described in detail by Fidalgo et al. \n\n(2016). Briefly, samples were washed with tap water and for endophytic bacteria isolation, AG and \n\nBG tissues from each plant were used. Plant surface was sterilized by sequentially immersing \n\nsamples in 50 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, 96 % ethanol during 1 min, 5 % \n\nNaOCl 30 min, 96 % ethanol 1 min, and rinsing in distilled water three times. Sterilization was \n\nconfirmed by inoculating water from the last wash in adequate culture medium. Afterwards, tissues \n\nwere then ground with a pestle in a mortar containing 10 mL of PBS; dilutions were prepared and \n\nspread on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), Marine Agar (MA, Difco, France), and R2A Agar \n\n(Merck, Germany) culture media. The plates were incubated up to 72 h at 28 \u00b0C and observed for \n\ncolony forming units count every 24 h. Endophytic bacterial colonies observed as distinct \n\nmorphologically were selected, purified, and stored at ?80 \u00b0C in 20 % glycerol.  \n\nAfter molecular typing by BOX-PCR, representative isolates were identified at the genus level by \n\nsequencing about 800 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Fidalgo et al., 2016; Martins, 2011). Isolates \n\nidentified as Pseudomonas (n = 39) were selected for further analysis in the scope of the present \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic analysis \n\nPhylogenetic diversity within the collection of Pseudomonas isolates was assessed using nearly full-\n\nlength 16S rRNA gene sequences. For this, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primers and PCR \n\nconditions described before (Tac\u00e3o et al., 2015). Similarity searches were performed with the BLAST \n\nsoftware (Altschul et al., 1990) against the GenBank database. Closest relatives were also \n\ndetermined with the EZTaxon tool available at http://www.ezbiocloud.net/eztaxon (Kim et al., \n\n2012). Additionally, gyrB gene of Pseudomonas isolates was sequenced, using PCR primers and \n\nconditions described elsewhere (Yamamoto et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nMaximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining trees were constructed based on the concatenated \n\nsequences of 16S rRNA and gyrB genes of isolates. Sequences of the corresponding genes of closest \n\nrelative type strains of Pseudomonas spp. (according to BLAST and EzTaxon results) were used to \n\nconstruct phylogenetic trees using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 6.0 (MEGA6; \n\nTamura et al., 2013). Kimura-2-parameter was used as the model of DNA sequence evolution. The \n\nbranch numbers refer to bootstrap confidence values obtained using 1000 replications. \n\n \n\nMetal tolerance assays \n\nMinimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in Luria-Bertani (LB, Fisher BioReagents, \n\nBelgium) agar supplemented with arsenic (As; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 As as Na2AsO4), \n\nchromium (Cr III; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 Cr as CrCl3?6H2O), copper (Cu; 100, 300, 400, 600, \n\nand 1000 ?g mL-1 Cu as CuSO4?5H2O), mercury (Hg; 5, 100, 150, 250, and 400 ?g mL-1 Hg as HgCl2), \n\nnickel (Ni; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 Ni as NiSO4?6H2O), and zinc (Zn; 50, 100,300, and 600 ?g \n\nmL-1 Zn as ZnCl2). Metal(loid) stock solutions were prepared in distilled water and sterilized. \n\nExperiments were conducted in triplicate. Results were registered after 5 days incubation at 30 \u00b0C. \n\nThe reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was included for quality control. Since there are \n\nno standard interpretative criteria for the classification of bacterial isolates as susceptible or \n\nresistant to metals, thresholds were defined based on previous studies (Nies, 1999; Malik and \n\nAleem, 2011). Hence, the sensitivity thresholds considered were 600 ?g mL-1 for As, 20 ?g mL-1 for \n\nHg, 250 ?g mL-1 for Cr, and 300 ?g mL-1 for Cu, Ni, and Zn. \n\n \n\nAntibiotic susceptibility assays \n\nIsolates were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics using the disk diffusion method on Mueller-\n\nHinton Agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) \n\nguidelines (CLSI 2012). The tested antibiotics were cefepime (FEP, 30 ?g), ampicillin (AMP, 10 ?g), \n\namoxicillin (AML, 10 ?g), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC, 20 ?g/10 ?g), piperacillin (PRL, 100 ?g), \n\naztreonam (ATM, 30 ?g), piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP, 100 ?g/10 ?g), cefotaxime (CTX, 30 ?g), \n\nceftazidime (CAZ, 30 ?g), imipenem (IPM, 10 ?g); tetracycline (TE, 30 ?g), gentamicin (CN, 10 ?g), \n\ntobramycin (TOB, 10 ?g), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 ?g), chloramphenicol (C, 30 ?g), and \n\nsulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT, 25 ?g). After 24 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, organisms were \n\nclassified as sensitive, intermediate, or resistant according to the CLSI guidelines. The E. coli ATCC \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n25922 was used as quality control. Cluster analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of \n\nPseudomonas isolates was performed using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient and Unweighted Pair \n\nGroup Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) algorithm. For this, matrices were constructed \n\nconsidering isolates classification as resistant (2), intermediate resistant (1), or susceptible (0) to \n\nantibiotics. \n\n \n\nPlant growth promoting trait assays \n\nAll isolates were screened in triplicate for different PGP activities: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-\n\ncarboxylate (ACC) deaminase, phosphate solubilization, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore \n\nproduction, nitrogen fixation, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production. ACC deaminase activity was \n\ndetermined by growing isolates in DF salt minimal medium (Dworkin and Foster, 1958) \n\nsupplemented with 3 mM ACC (DF+ACC) or 2 g L-1 (NH4)2SO4 (DF+Ammonium Sulfate) or no nitrogen \n\nsource (DF). The ability to use ACC as a sole nitrogen source is a consequence of the activity of the \n\nenzyme ACC deaminase (Penrose and Glick, 2003). Phosphate solubilization was observed as a clear \n\nhalo around bacterial growth on National Botanical Research Institute\u2019s Phosphate (NBRIP) solid \n\ngrowth medium (Nautiyal, 1999). IAA production was tested by the method described by Gordon \n\nand Weber (1951). Siderophore production was evaluated after inoculation in TSA medium \n\nfollowed by an overlay with O-CAS (P\u00e9rez-Miranda et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez-Miranda and Fern\u00e1ndez, \n\n2013) after incubation for 16 h at 30 \u00b0C. Bacterial growth overlaid with CAS was incubated for 2 h \n\nat room temperature. Siderophore production was identified as a change of color of the overlay \n\nfrom blue to orange or purple. Nitrogen fixing capacity was evaluated by PCR, targeting nifH gene \n\nwith primers and conditions described elsewhere (Ando et al., 2005). HCN production was \n\nevaluated streaking the isolates on Pseudomonas agar base (Liofilchem, Italy) supplemented with \n\n4.4 g L-1 glycine. A sterile filter paper was soaked with a picric acid solution (2.5 g L-1 picric acid and \n\n12.5 g L-1 Na2CO3 on distilled water) and placed on the upper lid of each plate. The plates were \n\nsealed with parafilm and incubated during 48 h at 30 \u00b0C (Reetha et al., 2014). HCN production was \n\nqualitatively identified as a change of color of the filter paper from yellow to light brown, brown, \n\nand reddish brown. Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Pseudomonas fluorescens S3X were used as \n\npositive controls for IAA production. For phosphate solubilization \u201cPseudomonas reactans\u201d EDP28, \n\nP. putida EAPC8, Arthrobacter rombi EC32A, and P. fluorescens S3X were used as negative controls, \n\nand Arthrobacter nicotinovorans EAPAA and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls. \n\nFor siderophore production \u201cP. reactans\u201d EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, P. fluorescens \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nS3X, A. nicotinovorans EAPAA, and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls (Pereira et \n\nal., 2015). Rahnella aquatilis (HQ538817; Proen\u00e7a et al., 2010) was used as a positive control and E. \n\ncoli ATCC 25922 was used as a negative control (Gaby and Buckley, 2012). Pseudomonas putida \n\nEAPC8 and A. rombi EC32A were used as positive controls for the ACC deaminase activity tests. For \n\nHCN production, a plate without bacterial suspension was used as negative control. \n\n \n\nAntimicrobial activity assays \n\nAntimicrobial activity was tested against six indicator strains from genera that include \n\nphytopathogenic members, isolated from H. portulacoides in the scope of previous studies \n\n(Martins, 2011) or obtained from private collections: Wautersia (W. eutropha NR92), \n\nAgrobacterium (A. tumefaciens NR163SFP) Pantoea (Pantoea brenneri PA112, Pantoea eucalypti \n\nRZ12) Erwinia (Erwinia rhapontici RZ93), and Curtobacterium (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens \n\nPA10). Assays were performed in TSA medium. The indicator strain was inoculated in TSA plates \n\nand left at room temperature for 30 min. These plates were then inoculated with 5 ?L of a bacterial \n\nsuspension of the collection of endophytic bacteria in NaCl 0.9 % (1 McFarland) and incubated at \n\n30 \u00b0C for 16 h. Antimicrobial activity was observed according to the presence (positive result) or \n\nabsence (negative result) of a halo surrounding the bacterial growth (Prado et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\nEnzymatic assays \n\nAll isolates were screened, in triplicate, for the following enzymatic activities: amylolytic, \n\ncellulolytic, lipolytic, pectinolytic, proteolytic, and xylanolytic. For enzymatic activity screening, \n\nbacterial isolates were streaked on TSA culture medium supplemented with appropriate substrate: \n\n0.2 % starch for amylolytic activity, 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose for cellulolytic activity, 1 % Tween \n\n20 for lipolytic, 0.5 % pectin for pectinolytic, 1 % skim milk for proteolytic, and 0.5 % xylan for \n\nxylanolytic activity. Amylolytic activity was detected when a clear halo was observed upon addition \n\nof Lugol solution after bacterial growth. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities were detected when \n\na clear halo was observed upon incubation in TSA with Congo red solution (1 % Congo red, with 10 \n\n% ethanol) and subsequent wash with 1 M NaCl. Lipolytic activity was observed by the formation \n\nof a white precipitate around the bacterial growth. Pectinolytic activity was detected by formation \n\nof a clear halo after addition of 1 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. \n\nProteolytic activity was revealed by visualization of a clear halo against an opaque background. The \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nresults were interpreted according to the visibility of the halo obtained: negative, no halo observed; \n\npositive, faint to intense halo observed.  \n\n \n\nEffect of bacteria inoculation on Arabidopsis thaliana root elongation \n\nThe effect of bacterial inoculation on A. thaliana root growth was evaluated using a protocol based \n\non Shi et al. (2010). The disinfection of the A. thaliana seeds was processed in sterile microtubes \n\nwith 500 ?L of a mixture of 70 % ethanol and 0.05 % Tween 20, followed by 5 min incubation at \n\nroom temperature. The supernatant was aspirated with a micropipette and 500 ?L of 100 % ethanol \n\nwere added. After an incubation of 5 min at room temperature, the ethanol was discarded. The \n\ndisinfected seeds (n = 15) were spread in a single line on half strength Murashige and Skoog medium \n\n(MS, Duchefa Biochemie, The Netherlands), supplemented with 1.5 % glucose and 0.8 % agar and \n\nthe plates were incubated, vertically, for 3 days at 4 \u00b0C, to promote germination. A bacterial cell \n\nsuspension on LB broth (OD600 = 0.6\u20130.8) was pelleted during 1 min at 13000 rpm and resuspended \n\nin 1 mL of half strength MS medium supplemented with 1.5 % glucose and without agar. Sterile \n\nfilter papers with 1 cm diameter were placed at 2 cm distance from the seeds line with 50 ?L of \n\nbacterial suspension. Plates were incubated, vertically, at 24 \u00b0C under a 16/8 h light-dark cycle. The \n\ntests were performed in triplicate and a negative control without bacterial suspension was \n\nincluded. At the end of the incubation period, 15 roots were measured and statistical analysis was \n\nperformed. The normality of the distribution of the root measurements was assessed with Shapiro\u2019s \n\nnormality test (shapiro.test). If a normal distribution was observed then the significance of the \n\ndifferences for each treatment against the control was assessed with t student test (t.test). Tests \n\nwere performed using the stats package in R (R Core Team, 2014). \n\n \n\nPCR screening for integrons, metal, and antibiotic resistance genes \n\nGenes conferring resistance to beta-lactams (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaGES, blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, \n\nblaOXA-2-like, blaOXA-10-like, blaOXA-30-like), sulphonamides (sul1), and chloramphenicol (cat) were \n\ninspected by PCR. Integrase screening was performed for intI1 and intI2 genes. All experiments \n\nincluded positive controls and also a PCR mixture containing water instead of DNA as negative \n\ncontrol. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S3.4. \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\nMercury resistance gene merA (encoding a mercuric reductase) was inspected by PCR. Primers and \n\nconditions were used as previously described (Deredjian et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nPlasmid profiles and replicon typing \n\nBacterial plasmid DNA was extracted with E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Mini Kit II (Omega Bio-tek, GA, USA). \n\nPlasmid diversity was analyzed by restriction analysis using 5 U of PstI (CTGCA?G) and 5 U of \n\nBst1770I (GTA?TAC), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc?ons (Fermentas, Lithuania). \n\nRestriction patterns were visualized in 0.8 % agarose gels (electrophoresis run at 40 V for 3 h) \n\nstained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with the Molecular Imager\u00ae Gel Doc\u2122 XR System \n\nand Image Lab\u2122 Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Restriction patterns were matched using \n\nGelCompar II software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). \n\nReplicon typing was performed by PCR for detection of FIA, FIB, FIC, HI1, HI2, I1-Ig, L/M, N, P, W, T, \n\nA/C, K, B/O, X, Y, F, and FIIA replicons, using primers and conditions described by Carattoli et al. \n\n(2005).  \n\nConjugation experiments were performed for selected isolates that showed resistance to Hg. This \n\nmetal was chosen since study sites were subjected to Hg-rich industrial discharges for four decades \n\n(1950s\u20131990s, Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001). For that, log-phase cultures of donor isolates and the \n\nrecipient strain E. coli CV601 were mixed at a 1:1 ratio in LB (Merck, Germany) broth and incubated \n\nat 30 \u00b0C for 24 h without shaking. Transconjugant selection was performed with LB agar plates with \n\n50 ?g mL-1 rifampicin and 25 ?g mL-1 Hg as HgCl2. \n\n \n\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers \n\nAll nucleotide sequences reported in this work have been submitted to the GenBank database, \n\nunder the accession numbers KT710788-KT710865. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\nThe environmental contamination with metals is a worldwide problem. The use of plants to remove \n\nmetals from polluted environments, i.e., phytoremediation, is seen as a promising alternative. \n\nEndophytic bacteria, which colonize internal tissues of plants without causing damage to the host, \n\nhave been reported as facilitators of phytoremediation processes (Compant et al., 2010), by \n\npromoting the proliferation of plants in contaminated sites.  \n\nThe genus Pseudomonas is a diverse microbial group that, due to its high genome plasticity, is able \n\nto adapt to severe environments and to degrade or tolerate a range of natural and synthetic \n\ncompounds (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010). Additionally, members of this genus were reported to \n\nefficiently promote plant growth (Preston, 2004). In this study, we analyzed endophytic \n\nPseudomonas isolates associated to the salt marsh plant H. portulacoides from metal(loid)-polluted \n\nsites. \n\nThough the potential of this plant for remediation of metal-polluted sites has been recognized, its \n\nphytosphere has never been explored to identify bacterial strains that may contribute to this \n\ndecontamination. Also, the specificities of salt marshes (e.g., high salinity, tide variation) justify the \n\nneed to identify indigenous bacterial strains that can be used for phytoremediation in this particular \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas isolates \n\nA collection of 39 previously obtained endophytic isolates of Pseudomonas (Fidalgo et al., 2016; \n\nMartins, 2011) was used in this study. While in the study conducted by Martins et al. (samples \n\ncollected in 2010), Pseudomonas was the predominant genus (46 % of the total number of isolates); \n\nin the study conducted by Fidalgo et al. (samples collected in 2012), Pseudomonas isolates \n\nrepresented only 2 % of the total number of isolates. The most common genera in the last study \n\nwere Microbacterium and Salinicola representing 10 and 9 % of the collection, respectively. \n\nDifferences in Pseudomonas prevalence between studies are probably related with the use of \n\ndifferent culture media. While TSA was used in both studies, Fidalgo et al. used also Marine Agar \n\nand R2A Agar. Marine Agar presents a high salt content thus favoring isolation and cultivation of \n\nmarine bacteria. R2A agar is a low nutrient medium specifically designed to cultivate oligotrophic \n\nbacteria. On the contrary, TSA may select for fast-growing heterotrophic bacteria including many \n\nPseudomonas strains. \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\nDetailed phylogenetic analysis of the Pseudomonas isolates used in the present study (n = 39) is \n\npresented in Figure 3.4. The phylogenetic tree based on neighbor-joining method was constructed \n\nusing concatenated 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences from all isolates and from closest related \n\nPseudomonas spp. type strains. Affiliation of the isolates was based on well-supported \n\nmonospecific clades (bootstrap values above 50 %) in the obtained phylogenetic tree. Based on this \n\ncriterion, isolates affiliated with the closest related species Pseudomonas sabulinigri (n = 16), \n\nPseudomonas koreensis (n = 10), Pseudomonas simiae (n = 5), Pseudomonas seleniipraecipitans (n \n\n= 2), Pseudomonas guineae (n = 2), Pseudomonas migulae (n = 1), Pseudomonas fragi (n = 1), and \n\nPseudomonas xanthomarina (n = 1). One isolate (RZ32) grouped with sequences from two different \n\nspecies in the same clade. Phylogenetic trees constructed using a different method, maximum-\n\nlikelihood, showed identical affiliation (data not shown). Although the applied methodology \n\nallowed affiliating most isolates to a closest related species, further analysis must be conducted to \n\nconfirm identification at species level. Multigene sequence analyses of 16S rRNA, ITS, gyrB, and \n\nrpoD have proven useful for Pseudomonas species identification. Furthermore, the basis to describe \n\nnew bacterial species has been DNA-DNA hybridization. However, the fact that many isolates \n\ngrouped in distinct clusters, distant to the closest type strain, suggests that these isolates probably \n\nrepresent undescribed Pseudomonas species.  \n\nResults suggest a high diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas spp. associated to the plant H. \n\nportulacoides. Although plant association is widely recognized among pseudomonads (Preston, \n\n2004), studies reporting endophytic Pseudomonas spp. are rare (Ryan et al., 2008; Rajkumar et al., \n\n2009). In fact, the majority of the species retrieved during this study have not been described before \n\nas endophytic. Exceptions were P. koreensis (Babu et al., 2015) and P. migulae (Ali et al., 2014). \n\nPseudomonas koreensis has also been described as epiphytic (Lopez-Velasco et al., 2012). \n\nPseudomonas koreensis and P. migulae were previously isolated from Miscanthus sinensis \n\nrhizosphere in metal(loid)-contaminated sites (Babu et al., 2015; Chaturvedi et al., 2006). \n\nClearly, isolates affiliating with P. koreensis and P. sabulinigri were more prevalent among our \n\ncollection. Pseudomonas sabulinigri has previously been isolated from black beach sand (Kim et al., \n\n2009), while P. koreensis has been isolated from multiple sources, and includes biosurfactant-\n\nproducing strains (Babu et al., 2015; Lopez-Velasco et al., 2012; Toribio et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Neighbor-joining (bootstrap=1000) tree illustrating the phylogenetic position of the Pseudomonas \n\nisolates obtained in this study and the closest related Pseudomonas type strains. The tree was constructed \n\nbased on 16S rRNA and gyrB concatenated gene sequences. \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nMetal tolerance, susceptibility to antibiotics, and plasmid profiling \n\nEndophytic bacteria may play an important role in enhancing the capability of plants to extract \n\nmetals from polluted environments (Rajkumar et al., 2009). Tolerance to metal(loid)s (Hg, Ni, Cu, \n\nCr, As, Zn) was studied in Pseudomonas isolates. The metal(loid) concentrations tested were higher \n\nthan the maximum contamination limits suggested by the European Regulatory Standards (EURS) \n\nfor European soils (Anyakora et al., 2013; Wuana and Okieimen, 2011). Additionally, these \n\nconcentrations were higher than those reported for soil and plant tissues in the sampled sites \n\n(Fidalgo et al., 2016). \n\nBacterial tolerance to Hg, Cu, and As was high, with 100, 92, and 82 % of tolerant isolates, \n\nrespectively (Figure 3.5). A lower percentage of tolerant isolates was observed for Ni (26 %) and for \n\nCr (15 %). Tolerance to Zn was not observed. Overall, the order of metal(loid) tolerance among the \n\nisolates was Hg>As>Cu>Ni>Cr>Zn. The majority (82 %) of the isolates were tolerant to three or more \n\nmetal(loid)s. Three isolates (PA100 closely related to P. seleniipraecipitans, 9PA12 closely related \n\nto P. xanthomarina, and 10R43 closely related to P. sabulinigri) showed tolerance to five \n\nmetal(loid)s. \n\nPseudomonas have developed tolerance mechanisms against several metal(loid)s including \n\nmicronutrient cations (Cu, Ni, and Zn), toxic cations (Hg), and toxic oxyanions (As and Cr) (Aguilar-\n\nBarajas et al., 2010; Stout and N\u00fcsslein, 2010). A comparative genomics study (Wu et al., 2011), \n\nwhich included endophytic and rhizospheric P. putida strains, revealed that the endophytic strain \n\npresented the highest number of genes related to metal(loid) tolerance. Most of these genes were \n\nlocated in genomic islands. Thus, the endophytic strain seemed best equipped for dealing with \n\nmetal(loid)-related pressure than its rhizospheric relative. In accordance, the endophytic P. putida \n\nstrain tolerated the highest concentrations of metal(loid)s (Wu et al., 2011). \n\nIsolates were most generally tolerant to Hg. One of the most common tolerance mechanisms to Hg \n\nis the reduction of this metal from the toxic cationic form to the volatile form. This \n\nbiotransformation was described in several Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. putida, \n\nand Pseudomonas stutzeri and is mediated by an Hg reductase encoded by merA gene located in \n\nthe mer operon (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010). Even though we conducted a PCR screening for the \n\nmerA gene, no positive results were obtained. It is plausible that the Hg-tolerance phenotypes here \n\nobserved may be related to other mechanisms such as efflux systems, also commonly reported in \n\nPseudomonas (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 Cluster analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Pseudomonas isolates from H. \n\nportulacoides, using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient and unweighted pair group method, using arithmetic \n\naverages cluster methods. Results of metal(loid) tolerance assays are also presented. AMP, ampicillin; PRL, \n\npiperacillin; TZP, piperacillin/tazobactam; AML, amoxicillin; AMC, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; CTX, \n\ncefotaxime; FEP, cefepime; CAZ, ceftazidime; IMP, imipenem; ATM, aztreonam; TOB, tobramycin; CN, \n\ngentamicin; CIP, ciprofloxacin; TE, tetracycline; C, chloramphenicol; SXT, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim; Hg, \n\nmercury; Cu, copper; As, arsenic; Ni, nickel; Zn, zinc; Cr, chromium. \n\n \n\nPseudomonas spp. tolerance to metals is extremely variable (Xu et al., 2015; Malik and Jaiswal, \n\n2000; Shamim and Rehman, 2013). Endophytic P. koreensis isolates were reported to tolerate \n\nconcentrations of Zn and As 30 and 4.5 times higher, respectively, than concentrations tolerated by \n\nour isolates (Babu et al., 2015). Those isolates were obtained from soil with concentrations of Zn \n\nand As 36 and 39 times higher than those reported for our sampling sites (Babu et al., 2015; Fidalgo \n\net al., 2016). These results suggest that Pseudomonas community may adapt, to a certain limit, to \n\ndeal with the metal(loid) pressure present in each environment. \n\nTolerance to metal(loid)s may be accompanied by antibiotic resistance mechanisms that can be \n\ncombined physiologically (cross-resistance) or genetically (co-resistance; Baker-Austin et al., 2006). \n\nThus, the use of metal(loid)-tolerant Pseudomonas strains in phytoremediation may contribute to \n\nthe spread of antibiotic resistance. From our collection, antibiotic susceptibility tests (Figure 3.5) \n\nshowed higher resistance levels against penicillins, namely ampicillin and amoxicillin, to which 87 \n\nand 79 % of the isolates, respectively, were resistant. For non-beta-lactam antibiotics, higher \n\nresistance was observed to chloramphenicol (33 %) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (18 %). \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\nClustering analysis of all antibiotic resistance (Figure 3.5) resulted in a dendrogram where three \n\nmain clusters were identified, corresponding to (i) isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri, P. \n\nguineae, P. fragi, P. seleniipraecipitans, and P. simiae, (ii) isolates closely related to P. koreensis, P. \n\nsimiae, and P. migulae, and (iii) isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri, P. xanthomarina, and \n\nPseudomonas sp.. Although a few exceptions could be identified in the dendrogram (e.g., not all \n\nisolates affiliated with P. sabulinigri grouped in the same cluster and a similar result was observed \n\nfor P. simiae), the distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles was mostly consistent with the \n\nphylogenetic affiliation, suggesting that the observed antibiotic resistance is part of the intrinsic \n\ncharacteristics of each species. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that common acquired \n\nantibiotic resistance genes were not detected in the analyzed isolates.  \n\nAntibiotic multiresistance was observed for 13 % of the isolates, showing an intermediate or \n\nresistant phenotype at least to three classes of antibiotics. Regarding resistance mechanisms to \n\nantibiotics, P. aeruginosa is the most studied species in the genus Pseudomonas, due to its clinical \n\nimportance. Multiresistance has been commonly reported in this species (Mesaros et al., 2007; \n\nTac\u00e3o et al., 2015) resulting from combinations of two or more resistance mechanisms (Livermore, \n\n2001; Mesaros et al., 2007). These include overexpression of efflux pumps with wide substrate \n\nspecificity, reduced outer membrane permeability, and/or high-level expression of ?-lactamases \n\n(Livermore, 2001; Mesaros et al., 2007).  \n\nAcquired antibiotic resistance and metal(loid) resistance may be encoded in mobile genetic \n\nelements such as integrons and/or plasmids (Tac\u00e3o et al., 2014). Integrase screening performed for \n\nintI1 and intI2 genes gave no positive results. Plasmidic DNA was identified in 17 out of 39 isolates \n\n(43.6 %) and enzymatic restriction analysis resulted in 10 different profiles. Plasmidic DNA \n\nrestriction profiles were not species-specific since the same pattern (100 % identity) was obtained \n\nfrom isolates affiliated to different species (Figure 3.6). One banding profile was identified in both \n\n11R35 (closely related to P. sabulinigri) and RZ31 (closely related to P. koreensis). Additionally, an \n\nidentical restriction pattern was observed for two isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri (12R50 \n\nand PA4), RZ85 (affiliated with P. simiae), and PA100 (affiliated with P. seleniipraecipitans). Finally, \n\nidentical profile was observed for two isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri (RZ27 and RZ39) and \n\nRZ56 (affiliated with P. fragi). These results suggest that different endophytic Pseudomonas species \n\nmay share similar replicons. Conjugation assays were performed for Hg-resistant isolates but did \n\nnot result in transconjugants and thus it was not possible to confirm the conjugative nature of such \n\nreplicons. \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 Cluster analysis of plasmidic DNA restriction profiles from endophytic Pseudomonas isolates. The \n\nDice similarity coefficient was used, along with the unweighted pair group method, using arithmetic averages \n\ncluster methods. \n\n \n\nPlant growth promoting activity \n\nIn addition to conferring plants higher tolerance to metal (loid)s, endophytic bacteria play a key role \n\nin promoting plant growth through the acquisition of nutrients by nitrogen fixation and phosphate \n\nsolubilization, and through the production of growth regulators such as IAA, siderophores, ACC \n\ndeaminase, and HCN production (Chauhan et al., 2015; Long et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2011). The \n\npresence of PGP traits was assessed for all isolates. Each isolate displayed at least one PGP trait \n\n(Table 3.4). Prevalent PGP traits were IAA production (100 % of the isolates were positive for this \n\ntrait), phosphate solubilization (90 % of the isolates), and HCN production (59 % of the isolates). \n\nIsolates producing concentrations of IAA higher than 100 ?g mL-1 were considered good producers, \n\nand represented 44 % of the collection. A lower fraction of isolates (44 %) was able to produce \n\nsiderophores. PGP traits such as ACC-deaminase production (3 %) and the presence of nifH gene (5 \n\n%) were rarer in our collection. PGP traits were not species-specific, as can be observed in Table \n\n3.4. \n\nIAA is a phytohormone that increases plants biomass, thus contributing to increased metal \n\naccumulation in plants (Stout and N\u00fcsslein, 2010). Bacterial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and \n\nphosphate solubilization help plants in nutrient acquisition (Long et al., 2008). HCN promotes plant \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\ngrowth preventing the damaging effect of phytopathogenic organisms (Chauhan et al., 2015). ACC \n\ndeaminase lowers plant ethylene levels and improves plant growth in metal polluted conditions \n\n(Stout and N\u00fcsslein, 2010). Siderophores, as chelating agents, protect plants, enabling them to \n\nresist to the hazardous effects of metals (Stout and N\u00fcsslein, 2010). \n\nIn previous studies, the most common PGP traits detected in Pseudomonas spp. were ACC \n\ndeaminase activity, siderophores, and IAA production, which are mainly involved in plant root and \n\nshoot elongation and metal uptake (Ma et al., 2011). Several Pseudomonas spp. have also been \n\ndescribed as good phosphate solubilizers (Rajkumar et al., 2009) and HCN production is also \n\ncommon among pseudomonads (Pereira et al., 2016). In the present study, we observed that the \n\nmajority of the isolates produced IAA, HCN, siderophores, and solubilized phosphate. This suggests \n\nthat Pseudomonas strains in the endosphere may help plants accumulate metals, since plant \n\nbiomass is increased, and metal toxicity to the plant is attenuated. \n\n \n\nEnzymatic and antimicrobial activity \n\nMetal-tolerant bacterial strains have been reported as biological control agents, presenting \n\nantimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi, bacteria, insects, and other organisms (Compant et \n\nal., 2010; Pereira et al., 2015). \n\nHere, we evaluated antimicrobial activity against representatives of phytopathogenic bacteria. \n\nAntagonistic activity was observed in 20 % of the isolates, as shown in Table 3.4. RZ39 and RZ38 \n\n(closely related to P. sabulinigri), Z4 and RZ98 (affiliated with P. koreensis), and Pseudomonas sp. \n\nRZ32 showed antimicrobial activity against one tested strain. RZ31 (affiliated with P. koreensis) and \n\nRZ109 (affiliated with P. simiae) showed antimicrobial activity against two tested strains, and RZ1 \n\n(affiliated with P. simiae) against three test strains. These isolates may have a relevant role as \n\nbiological control agents by protecting the plant against phytopathogens. So far, the evaluation of \n\nplant-associated pseudomonads as biocontrol agents has been mostly focused on P. fluorescens \n\nisolates, which have been proven to play an important role in antifungal activity (Petat\u00e1n-Sagah\u00f3n \n\net al., 2011; Ganeshan and Kumar, 2005). \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nTable 3.4 Plant growth promotion traits, antimicrobial, and enzymatic activities of Pseudomonas isolates from H. portulacoides.  \n\nStrains Site \nPlant Growth Promotion Traits Antimicrobial Activity Enzymatic Activity \n\nP IAA Sid.

Length of A. thaliana roots when inoculated with PA100 and RZ1, was \n\non average 1.2 and 1.3 times higher than the length of roots of control plants (Figure 3.7). \n\nDifferences between inoculated and control plants were significant for PA100 (p-value &lt;0.05) and \n\nRZ1 (p-value &lt;0.05). Strain RZ1 showed a significantly stronger positive effect on A. thaliana root \n\ndevelopment when compared to PA100 (p-value &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 Effects of endophytic Pseudomonas inoculation on A. thaliana seedlings growth. Statistical \n\nsignificance is shown with p &lt;0.01(*). Control, no inoculation; PA100 and RZ1 represent inoculation with \n\nisolates.  \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nConclusions \n\nThis work highlights the diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas in H. portulacoides from metal(loid)-\n\ncontaminated sites and their potential to be applied as facilitators of phytoremediation processes. \n\nMetal(loid) tolerance was common among analyzed isolates. Antibiotic resistance traits were \n\nmostly related with intrinsic characteristics of the species, and evidence of co-selection by \n\nmetal(loid)s was not gathered.  \n\nTraits with potential benefits to plants, such as the production of PGP, production of enzymes, and \n\nactivity against phytopathogens, were also observed in endophytic Pseudomonas. For example, \n\nisolate PA100 was tolerant to five metal(loid)s (Hg, As, Cu, Cr, and Ni), produced three PGP traits, \n\npresented antimicrobial activity against three representatives of phytophatogenic bacteria, and \n\nproduced all tested enzymes. Isolate RZ1 was tolerant to two metals, produced three PGP traits, \n\nfour enzymes and showed antimicrobial activity against three representatives of plant pathogens. \n\nPreliminary results show that these isolates promote A. thaliana root elongation. As demonstrated \n\npreviously, bacterial strains may be used to inoculate plants in order to promote growth and/or \n\nhelp detoxify the environment (Rajkumar et al., 2009), thus potentially contributing for \n\nphytoremediation efficacy. The potential of the isolates characterized in this study for \n\nphytoremediation should be further tested in vivo in H. portulacoides. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work was supported by European Funds (FEDER) through COMPETE and by National Funds through the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) within project PhytoMarsh (PTDC/AAC-651 \n\nAMB/118873/2010-FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-019328).

Molecular typing using enterobacterial repetitive \n\nintergenic consensus ERIC-PCR fingerprinting showed the strains to be highly similar. Phylogenetic \n\nanalyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using \n\ngyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk and 16S rRNA genes sequences showed that the strains represented a \n\nmember of the genus Microbacterium, with Microbacterium lacus DSM 18910T as the closest \n\nphylogenetic relative. DNA\u2013DNA hybridization between strain RZ63T and its closest relative was \n\nbelow 70 %, supporting the hypothesis that it represented a distinct genomic species. \n\nChemotaxonomic analyses of the novel strains and their DNA G+C contents confirmed their \n\naffiliation to the genus Microbacterium, however, the peptidoglycan of RZ63T contained \n\ndiaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. In addition, physiological and fatty acid analyses \n\nrevealed differences between these strains and their phylogenetic relatives, reinforcing their status \n\nas a distinct species. Based on the physiological, genetic and chemotaxonomic characterization it is \n\nproposed that the strains studied represent a novel species of the genus Microbacterium for which \n\nthe name Microbacterium diaminobutyricum sp. nov. is proposed (type strain RZ63T=DSM \n\n27101T=CECT 8355T). \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nActinobacteria, endophytic, salt-marsh, halophytes, taxonomy \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\nMain text \n\nThe genus Microbacterium includes a very large number of species (over 90) that have been isolated \n\nfrom a wide diversity of environments including plant-associated habitats. For example, \n\nMicrobacterium foliorum and Microbacterium phyllosphaerae were isolated from the phyllosphere \n\nof grasses (Behrendt et al., 2001). Madhaiyan et al. (2010) described Microbacterium azadirachtae, \n\na plant growth promoting bacterium, from the rhizoplane of Azadirachta indica seedlings. Karojet \n\net al. (2012) described Microbacterium yannicii isolated from roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. In \n\naddition, endophytic strains of members of the genus Microbacterium have been isolated from \n\ndifferent plants, such as sweet corn (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) (McInroy &amp; Kloepper, \n\n1995), marigolds (Tagetes erecta and T. patula) (Sturz &amp; Kimpinski, 2004), switchgrass (Panicum \n\nvirgatum) (Gagne-Bourgue et al., 2013) and wild legumes (Zakhia et al., 2006).  \n\nThe halophyte Halimione portulacoides (sea purslane) is a common and abundant species in salt \n\nmarshes. This plant is known to sequestrate and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metals found \n\nin salt marsh sediments, namely mercury (Hg), and has been proposed as a bioindicator and \n\nbiomonitor for Hg-contamination (V\u00e1lega et al., 2008). Furthermore, this halophyte appears to be \n\nsuitable for phytoremediation of Hg-contaminated salt marshes (Anjum et al., 2011). \n\nIt is recognised that endophytic bacteria establish complex, intimate and dynamic interactions with \n\ntheir plant hosts, having effects on fundamental aspects such as plant growth and health as well as \n\npromotion of stress resistance (Berg et al., 2014). A study of the culturable endophytic bacteria of \n\nH. portulacoides in the salt marsh Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) unveiled a phylogenetically and \n\nfunctionally diverse microbiota (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Among the 79 bacterial genera identified, \n\nMicrobacterium arose as one of the most abundant and diverse especially in Hg-contaminated sites. \n\nThus, the endosphere of H. portulacoides appears to represent a hotspot of diversity for the genus \n\nMicrobacterium. This is corroborated by the recent description of three novel endophytic \n\nMicrobacterium species (M. endophyticum, M. halimionae and M. proteolyticum) from H. \n\nportulacoides (Alves et al., 2014, 2015). \n\nThe aim of this study was to carry out a detailed taxonomic characterization of three novel isolates \n\nof endophytic Microbacterium isolates obtained from roots of the halophyte salt marsh plant H. \n\nportulacoides collected in the estuary Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, in the area of Laranjo Bay, Murtosa \n\n(40\u00b0 43\u2019 48.0\u201dN 8\u00b0 36\u2019 45.5\u201d W). Plant roots sterilization and bacterial isolation was performed as \n\ndescribed previously (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Roots were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; \n\n140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4) for 10 min, 96 % ethanol for 1 min, 5 \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\n% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, 96 % ethanol for 1 min, and finally sterile distilled water for 3 \n\nmin (repeated three times). In order to confirm sterility of root surface, aliquots (0.1 mL) of the final \n\nwash in sterile water were plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 72 h. Plant \n\nroots were macerated in PBS and tenfold dilutions of the extracts were made on the same buffer. \n\nAliquots of the dilutions (0.1 mL) were plated on TSA. After incubation at 28 \u00b0C for 72 h, the obtained \n\ncolonies were transferred to new TSA plates for purification. Strains RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 were \n\nroutinely cultured on TSA at 28 \u00b0C and preserved at -80 \u00b0C on tryptic soy broth (TSB; Merck) \n\nsupplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol.  \n\nGenomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific) according \n\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was evaluated by \n\nenterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus ERIC-PCR fingerprinting using primers ERIC1 and \n\nERIC2 (Alves et al., 2007). Cluster analysis of ERIC fingerprints was carried out with the software \n\nGelCompar II (Applied Maths). \n\nThe 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the universal primers 27F and 1492R (Lane, 1991). PCR \n\nproducts were purified with the DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator 5 (Zymo Research) and sequenced at \n\nGATC Biotech (Cologne, Germany). The identification of phylogenetic neighbors was done by \n\nsearching against the EzTaxon database (http://www.ezbiocloud.net/eztaxon; Kim et al., 2012). The \n\n16S rRNA gene pairwise sequence similarities were determined using the program PHYDIT v3.1 \n\n(Chun, 2001). \n\nA multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was performed using the scheme proposed by Richert et al. \n\n(2007). Thus, in addition to the 16S rRNA gene, the housekeeping genes coding for DNA gyrase \n\nsubunit B (gyrB), RNA-polymerase subunit B (rpoB), recombinase A (recA) and polyphosphate \n\nkinase (ppk) were amplified and sequenced. A BLAST search of the primers used by Richert et al. \n\n(2007) against the GenBank database revealed a considerable number of mismatches in some \n\nprimer binding sites of sequences from several species of the genus Microbacterium. Therefore, we \n\ndeveloped novel sets of primers for the amplification and sequencing of gyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk \n\ngenes in Microbacterium spp. (Table 4.1). For this, full-length sequences of these genes were \n\nretrieved from completed or draft genomes of Microbacterium maritypicum MF109 (accession \n\nnumber ATAO01000228), Microbacterium barkeri 2011-R4 (accession number AKVP01000049), \n\nMicrobacterium oleivorans RIT293 (accession number JFYO01000005), Microbacterium \n\nparaoxydans DH1b (accession number AYME01000002), Microbacterium laevaniformans OR221 \n\n(accession number AJGR01000511), Microbacterium yannicii PS01 (accession number \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\nCAJF01000029), Microbacterium testaceum NS283 (accession number LDRU01000035), \n\nMicrobacterium luticocti DSM 19459T (accession number AULS01000018), Microbacterium indicum \n\nDSM 19969T (accession number AULR01000004), and Microbacterium gubbeenense DSM 15944T \n\n(accession AUGQ01000021) available in GenBank. For each gene, sequences were aligned using \n\nCLUSTALX v2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) and primers designed for regions showing high similarity. Primer \n\nfeatures such as melting temperature (Tm), DNA G+C content (%), self-annealing, GC clamp and \n\nhairpin formation were checked using the programs available at the Sequence Manipulation Suite \n\nsite (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/pcr_primer_stats.html).

(2007). \n\n \n\nNearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and concatenated sequences of gyrB, rpoB, recA and \n\nppk and 16S rRNA genes were aligned with sequences from type strains of Microbacterium species \n\nretrieved from the GenBank database using CLUSTALX v2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007). Phylogenetic \n\nanalyses were performed with MEGA v6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) using the neighbour-joining (NJ) \n\n(Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML) (Felsenstein, 1981) algorithms. Evolutionary \n\ndistances were calculated using the Kimura-2-parameter model. Clavibacter michiganensis DSM \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\n46364T was used as the outgroup taxon. A bootstrap analysis (Hillis &amp; Bull, 1993) based on 1000 \n\nreplicates was done to evaluate the robustness of the trees topologies. \n\nERIC-PCR fingerprinting showed that strains RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 had highly similar ERIC \n\nfingerprints (Figure 4.1). Nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1436 bp) were obtained for \n\nall strains. 16S rRNA gene pairwise sequence comparisons showed that sequences from strains \n\nRZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 shared 100 % similarity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 UPGMA cluster analysis based on the Pearson coefficient of ERIC-PCR fingerprints of \n\nMicrobacterium spp. strains isolated from roots of Halimione portulacoides. Similarity is indicated as a \n\npercentage. \n\n \n\nA search against the EzTaxon database confirmed that all strains belonged to the genus \n\nMicrobacterium. RZ63T and relatives showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the \n\ntype strain of M. lacus (98.9 %). Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from all known \n\nspecies of the genus showed that these strains formed a distinct sub-clade (in both NJ and ML trees) \n\nwith very high bootstrap support (99\u2013100 %) within a larger clade containing several species of the \n\ngenus Microbacterium (Supplementary Figure S4.1). \n\nUsing the primers developed, we amplified and sequenced the genes gyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk of \n\nRZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104, as well as of the type strains of M. endophyticum (PA15T), M. hatanonis \n\n(DSM 19179T), M. lacus (DSM 18910T), M. proteolyticum (RZ36T), M. pumilum (DSM 21018T) and M. \n\nsaccharophilum (NCIMB 14782T) (Supplementary Table S4.1). For M. halimionae PA36T, all primer \n\nsets worked well except the ones developed for gyrB. Despite the design of several primer sets and \n\nthe testing of different amplification conditions, it was impossible to amplify and sequence the gyrB \n\ngene. For this reason, M. halimionae PA36T was not included in the MLSA analyses. Phylogenetic \n\nanalyses of concatenated sequences of gyrB, rpoB, recA, ppk and 16S rRNA genes confirmed the \n\naffiliation of the strains to the genus Microbacterium. RZ63T and its relatives formed a clearly \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\ndistinct clade with very high bootstrap support (100 %) (Figure 4.2). Moreover, this MLSA analysis \n\nconfirmed that M. lacus DSM 18910T was the closest phylogenetic relative of the strains studied. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of gyrB, rpoB, recA and \n\nppk and 16S rRNA genes, showing the relationship between strains isolated from Halimione portulacoides \n\nand a set of type strains of species of the genus Microbacterium.

Growth at different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 37, 44 \u00b0C), NaCl concentrations \n\n(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 %, w/v) and pH values (4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10, 11, 12) was tested using TSA \n\nas the basal medium. In the case of pH tests, the medium was adjusted using appropriate buffer \n\nsolutions (McIlvaine, 1921; Bates &amp; Bower, 1956). Oxidase and catalase activities were tested as \n\ndescribed previously (Trujillo et al., 2006). Gram reaction was determined using a Gram Staining kit \n\n(Merck) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Physiological characteristics of the strains \n\nwere determined using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH test strips (Biom\u00e9rieux) following the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Hydrolysis of casein and Tween 20 was evaluated by growing \n\nthe strains on TSA supplemented with 1 % skim milk or Tween 20. After incubation at 28 \u00b0C for 72 \n\nh casein hydrolysis was revealed by the formation of a transparent halo around the colonies while \n\nhydrolysis of Tween 20 resulted in the formation of precipitates around the colonies. On the basis \n\nof pairwise comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequences as well as MLSA analyses, Microbacterium \n\nflavum DSM 18909T and Microbacterium lacus DSM 18910T (Kageyama et al., 2007) were chosen as \n\nreference strains for comparative phenotypic studies.  \n\nThe three endophytic strains produced circular, smooth and yellow-pigmented colonies on TSA \n\nmedium. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, aerobic and short rods. RZ63T and related strains were \n\noxidase-positive and catalase activity was variable (strain RZ102 was catalase-negative). None of \n\nthe strains studied reduced nitrate to nitrite and all were negative for indole production. All strains \n\n(RZ63T and related strains) were able to grow in the presence of NaCl up to 8 % (w/v). Table 4.2 \n\npresents the differential characteristics between RZ63T (and related strains) and the type strains of \n\nM. lacus (DSM 18910T) and M. flavum (DSM 18909T). \n\nBacterial biomass for chemotaxonomic analyses was prepared by cultivating the strains in TSB at \n\n28 \u00b0C for 72 h on a rotary shaker until reaching stationary phase. Cells were harvested by \n\ncentrifugation and washed with 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl. The analyses of peptidoglycan structure were \n\nperformed using TLC, 2D TLC, gas chromatography and GC/MS as described by Schumann (2011). \n\nMenaquinones were extracted from freeze-dried cells using the two-stage method described by \n\nTindall (1990a, b), separated by TLC on silica gels and further analyzed by HPLC. For fatty acid methyl \n\nester analysis, all strains were grown on TSA at 28 \u00b0C for 3 days or until good growth was obtained \n\non the third quadrant (Sasser, 1990). Fatty acids were extracted, methylated and analyzed \n\naccording to the standard protocol of the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI) and peaks \n\nwere named using the database SACTIN6. Polar lipid and whole-cell hydrolysate sugar analyses \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\nwere carried out following the procedures of Minnikin et al. (1984) and Staneck &amp; Roberts (1974) \n\nusing freeze-dried biomass.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 Differential characteristics of strains obtained from Halimione portulacoides and phylogenetically \n\nrelated Microbacterium species, M. flavum DSM 18909T and M. lacus DSM 18910T.  \n\nCharacteristic RZ63T RZ102 RZ104 \nM. flavum \n\nDSM 18909T \n\nM. lacus \n\nDSM 18910T \n\nGrowth at:      \n\n   Temperature range (\u00b0C) 10?37 10?37 10?37 10-37 15-30 \n\n   pH range 6.5?11 6.5?11 6.5?11 6.5-11 6.0-11 \n\n   NaCl range (w/v, %) 0.5?8 0.5?8 0.5?8 0.5-8 0.5-2 \n\nOxidase + + + ? nd \n\nCatalase + ? + + nd \n\nD-glucose fermentation ? + + + ? \n\nHydrolysis of:      \n\n   Gelatin  + ? ? ? ? \n\n   Casein ? ? ? nd nd \n\n   Aesculin ? + + + + \n\n   Tween 20 ? ? ? nd nd \n\n   Urease + ? ? ? ? \n\n   Esterase (C4) ? + + + + \n\n   Leucine arylamidase ? + + + + \n\n   Valine arylamidase ? + + + + \n\n   Cystine arylamidase ? + + + + \n\n   Trypsin ? + + + + \n\n   ?-Galactosidase  ? + w ? + \n\n   ?-Galactosidase + + + + + \n\n   ?-Glucuronidase + + + ? ? \n\n   ?-Mannosidase ? + + ? w \n\nAssimilation of:      \n\n   Glycerol + + + ? ? \n\n   Erythritol ? w ? ? ? \n\n   D-Arabinose ? w w ? ? \n\n   L-Arabinose + + + + ? \n\n   D-Ribose ? w w ? ? \n\n   D-Xylose + + + ? w \n\n   D-Galactose + + + + ? \n\n   L-Sorbose ? w w ? ? \n\n   L-Rhamnose w + w w ? \n\n   Methyl-?-D-glucopyranoside + ? w ? ? \n\n   N-acetylglucosamine w ? ? + ? \n\n   Amygdalin + + + + ? \n\n   Arbutin + + + + ? \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\n   Salicin + + + + ? \n\n   D-Lactose + + + + ? \n\n   D-Melibiose ? ? ? + ? \n\n   D-Trehalose + + + + w \n\n   Inulin ? ? ? + ? \n\n   D-Melezitose ? ? ? + + \n\n   D-Raffinose ? ? ? + + \n\n   Starch ? ? ? + + \n\n   Glycogen ? ? ? + + \n\n   Xylitol ? ? ? + ? \n\n   Gentiobiose ? ? w + ? \n\n   D-Lyxose ? ? ? + ? \n\n   D-Tagatose ? ? ? + ? \n\n   D-Fucose ? ? ? + ? \n\n   L-Fucose ? ? ? + ? \n\n   D-Arabitol ? ? ? + ? \n\n   L-Arabitol ? ? ? + ? \n\n   Potassium gluconate w ? w + ? \n\n   Potassium 5-ketogluconate ? ? ? w ? \n\n   Malic acid ? ? ? + ? \n\n   Trisodium citrate ? ? ? + ? \n\n   Phenylacetic acid + ? ? ? ? \n\nDNA G+C content (mol%) 68.9 nd nd 70 69 \n\n+, positive; w, weak; ?, negative; nd, not determined. \n\n \n\nChemotaxonomic analyses showed that peptidoglycan of strain RZ63T contained the amino acids \n\nalanine, glycine, homoserine (Hse), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB), glutamic acid and muramic acid \n\n(Mur) with molar ratios of 0.8 : 1.0 : 1.0 : 0.8 : 1.6 : 0.5. Partial hydrolysate of strain RZ63T contained \n\nthe peptide Gly\u2013Glu. These data suggest that the peptidoglycan of RZ63T belongs to type B2? with \n\nglycolyl residues (Schumann, 2011). In comparison to M. lacus DSM 18910T that has ornithine (Orn) \n\nas the diagnostic diaminoacid, RZ63T has DAB as the diagnostic diamino acid. While several other \n\nmembers of the family Microbacteriaceae (e.g. members of the genera Agromyces, Agrococcus, \n\nClavibacter, Cryobacterium, Leucobacter and Plantibacter) contain DAB as the diagnostic diamino \n\nacid (Evtushenko &amp; Takeuchi, 2006), the strains of members of the genus Microbacterium described \n\nso far have either lysine (Lys) or Orn as the diagnostic diaminoacid (Table 4.3). This is quite a \n\ndistinguishing feature of RZ63T. Peptidoglycan analysis was repeated and the results were \n\nconfirmed. Whole-cell sugar analyses revealed the presence of ribose, galactose, glucose and \n\nmannose.  \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nRegarding menaquinones, RZ63T contained MK-10 (2 %), MK-11 (29 %), MK-12 (61 %) and MK-13 (6 \n\n%) and this composition is in accordance with that reported for members of the genus \n\nMicrobacterium. The major fatty acids (>10 %) of RZ63T were anteiso-C15:0 (69.1 %) and iso-C15:0 \n\n(19.3 %) (Table 4.4). Quantitative differences of iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0 were found between \n\nRZ63T and the remaining strains compared. Nevertheless, the tests were run again and the results \n\nwere confirmed. With respect to the polar lipid profile of the novel strain (Supplementary Figure \n\nS4.2) the following lipids were detected: diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one \n\nunidentified glycolipid, two unidentified phospholipids, four unidentified aminolipids and one \n\nunidentified lipid. These results are in agreement with the polar lipid profile reported for other \n\nspecies of the genus Microbacterium. \n\nThe DNA base composition of RZ63T was determined by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). DNA was \n\nisolated by the modified procedure described by Gevers et al. (2001) and hybridizations were \n\ncarried out at 53 \u00b0C in the presence of 50 % formamide using the modified microplate method (Ezaki \n\net al., 1989; Goris et al., 1998; Cleenwerck et al., 2002). RZ63T was hybridized against the species \n\nwith the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity, namely M. lacus DSM 18910T. \n\nThe DNA G+C content of RZ63T was 68.9 mol%. The value is within the range of 61\u201375 % reported \n\nfor species of the genus Microbacterium (Suzuki &amp; Hamada, 2012; Alves et al., 2014). DNA\u2013DNA \n\nhybridization was used to clarify the relatedness of the strains and their closest relatives. DNA\u2013 \n\nDNA relatedness between RZ63T and M. lacus DSM 18910T was 14\u00b11 %. Therefore, RZ63T represents \n\na novel genomic species (Wayne et al., 1987). \n\n \n\nOn the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic results described RZ63T (and \n\nrelated strains) are clearly distinct from their closest phylogenetic relative M. lacus DSM 18910T and \n\nrepresent a novel species in the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium \n\ndiaminobutyricum sp. nov. is proposed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\nTable 4.3 Chemotaxonomic markers of selected members of the genus Microbacterium. \n\n \n\nR\nZ\n\n6\n3\n\nT\n \n\nR\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n \n\nR\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\n4\n \n\nM\n. \n\nla\nct\n\nic\nu\n\nm\n \n\nM\n. \n\nfl\na\n\nvu\nm\n\n \n\nM\n. \n\nla\ncu\n\ns \n\nM\n. \n\nh\na\n\nli\nm\n\nio\nn\n\na\ne\n\n \n\nM\n. \n\ne\nn\n\nd\no\n\np\nh\n\nyt\nic\n\nu\nm\n\n \n\nM\n. \n\np\nu\n\nm\nil\n\nu\nm\n\n \n\nM\n. \n\nte\nrr\n\ne\ng\n\ne\nn\n\ns \n\nM\n. \n\np\nro\n\nte\no\n\nly\nti\n\ncu\nm\n\n \n\nM\n. \n\ng\nin\n\nse\nn\n\ng\nit\n\ne\nrr\n\na\ne\n\n \n\nMain fatty acidsa ai-C15 \n\ni-C15 \n\nai-C15 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C15 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\ni-C16 \n\nai-C17 \n\nai-C15 \n\nai-C17 \n\ni-C16 \n\nCell-wall diamino acid DAB nd nd Lys Lys Orn Orn Orn Orn Orn Orn Orn \n\nPolar lipid analysis DPG PG \n\nGL 4AL \n\n2PL \n\n1L \n\nnd nd DPG \n\nPG \n\nPGL \n\nPL \n\nnd nd nd nd nd DPG \n\nPG \n\nGL \n\nDPG \n\nPG \n\n2GL \n\n3PL \n\n1L \n\nDPG \n\nPG \n\nGL \n\n4AL \n\nWhole cell-wall sugars Gal \n\nGlu Man \n\nRib \n\nnd nd Gal \n\nMan \n\nRha \n\nnd nd nd nd Gal \n\nRha \n\n6dT \n\nGal \n\nRha \n\nGal \n\nGlu \n\nRha \n\nRib \n\nXyl \n\nGal \n\nRib \n\nXyl \n\nMenaquinones MK-10 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nnd nd MK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nMK-9 \n\nMK-10 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-9 \n\nMK-10 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nMK-14 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nMK-10 \n\nMK-11 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-12 \n\nMK-13 \n\nai-, anteiso-; i-, iso-; DAB, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid; Lys, lysine; Orn, ornithine; DPG, diphosphatidylglycerol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; GL, unidentified glycolipids; AL, \n\nunidentified amino lipid; PL, unidentified phospholipid; L, unidentified polar lipid; PGL, unidentified phosphoglycolipid; Gal, galactose; Glu, glucose; Man, mannose; \n\nRib, ribose; Rha, rhamnose; 6dT, 6-deoxytalose; Xyl, xylose; nd, not determined. \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\nTable 4.4 Cellular fatty acid profiles of strains isolated from roots of Halimione portulacoides and \n\nphylogenetically related species of the genus Microbacterium.  \n\nFatty acid RZ63T RZ102 RZ104 \nM. flavum \n\nDSM 18909T \n\nM. lacus  \n\nDSM 18910T \n\nanteiso-C13:0 1.8 0.2 0.2 ? 0.1 \n\niso-C14:0 3.8 1.0 0.9 0.7 0.8 \n\nC14:0 0.6 0.3 0.3 ? 0.2 \n\niso-C15:0 19.3 0.8 0.9 6.2 2.3 \n\nanteiso-C15:0 69.1 53.3 53.2 52.9 40.9 \n\niso-C16:0 2.2 20.0 19.8 14.3 15.5 \n\nC16:0 0.4 3.9 4.2 1.5 4.1 \n\nanteiso-C17:0 0.9 19.7 19.9 20.7 33.4 \n\niso-C17:0 ? 0.1 0.1 2.7 1.5 \n\nC18:0 ? ? ? ? ? \n\niso-C18:0 ? ? ? 0.1 ? \n\nValues are percentages of total fatty acids; ?, not detected. \n\n \n\nEmended description of the genus Microbacterium Orla-Jensen 1919 Takeuchi and \n\nHatano 1998 \n\nThe emended description of the genus is based on that given by Takeuchi &amp; Hatano (1998) with the \n\nfollowing modification: the peptidoglycan contains either lysine, ornithine or diaminobutyric acid \n\nas the diagnostic diamino acid. \n\n \n\nDescription of Microbacterium diaminobutyricum sp. nov. \n\nMicrobacterium diaminobutyricum (di.a.mi.no.bu.ty\u2019ri.cum.

The isolate was mesophilic, \n\nfacultatively alkaliphilic and halophilic, and grew between 18 and 42.5 \u00b0C (optimum 30 \u00b0C), from pH \n\n5.0 to 11.5 (optimum 7.0-7.5), from 0.5 to 5 % NaCl (w/v, optimum 2 %). Analysis of the 16S rRNA \n\ngene sequence showed that this strain belongs to the genus Saccharospirillum, as the highest \n\nsequence similarities were observed with Saccharospirillum impatiens EL-105T (96.46 %), \n\nSaccharospirillum salsuginis YIM-Y25T (96.32 %) and Saccharospirillum aestuarii IMCC 4453T (95.17 \n\n%). The next closest matches were with other genera and below 95.0 %. Phylogenetic analyses \n\nrevealed that the strain forms a robust clade with other species of the genus Saccharospirillum. The \n\nmain respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the major fatty acids were C16:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 \n\n?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c). The DNA G+C content was 55.2 mol%. Molecular, physiological and \n\nbiochemical differences between strain CPA1T and other type strains of species of the genus \n\nSaccharospirillum support the addition of this novel species to the genus, and the name \n\nSaccharospirillum correiae sp. nov. is proposed, with CPA1T (= CECT 9131T = LMG 29516T) as the \n\ntype strain. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nSaccharospirillaceae, endophytic, salt marsh, halophytes, taxonomy \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n140 \n \n\nMain text \n\nThe genus Saccharospirillum, established by Labrenz et al. (2003), belongs to the family \n\nSaccharospirillaceae and, at the time of writing, it comprises three species with validly published \n\nnames, all of which have been isolated from saline environments: Saccharospirillum impatiens from \n\na hypersaline lake (Labrenz et al., 2003), Saccharospirillum salsuginis from subterranean brine \n\n(Chen et al., 2009), and Saccharospirillum aestuarii from mudflats (Choi et al., 2011). The genus has \n\nbeen described as Gram-negative spirilla, non-spore forming, containing poly-?-hydroxybutyrate, \n\nwhich may form coccoid bodies in older cultures, and positive for peroxidase, catalase and \n\ncytochrome oxidase activities, with Q-8 as the prevalent respiratory quinone, and C16:1 ?7c, C16:0 \n\nand C18:1 ?7c as the predominant fatty acids (Labrenz et al., 2003). This genus has also been \n\ndescribed as comprising obligate aerobes, microaerophiles or facultative anaerobes. The motility \n\nand presence of flagella has been determined to be species-dependent (Choi et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\nIn a study of the bacterial diversity associated with the internal tissues of the halophyte Halimione \n\nportulacoides, 665 isolates were obtained and characterized (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Briefly, healthy \n\nspecimens of the halophyte were collected in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, and above- and belowground \n\ntissues were separated and surface sterilized. Dilutions of macerated tissues were plated in Tryptic \n\nSoy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), R2A (Merck, Germany) and Marine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, \n\nFrance). The present study focuses on strain CPA1T, an isolate obtained from surface sterilized \n\naboveground tissues of H. portulacoides. Strain CPA1T was routinely streaked on MA medium and \n\nincubated under aerobic conditions at 28 \u00b0C.  \n\n \n\nGenomic DNA of the strain was extracted using a Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo \n\nScientific, USA), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR \n\nwith universal primers 27F and 1492R, as described elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016), and sequenced \n\nwith primers 27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., 2006). Analysis of similarity using a near \n\nfull length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1418 nt) also gave evidence that strain CPA1T belongs to the \n\ngenus Saccharospirillum, as highest similarities were seen with this genus: S. impatiens EL-105T \n\n(96.46 %), S. salsuginis YIM-Y25T (96.32 %) and S. aestuarii IMCC 4453T (95.17 %). The next closest \n\nmatches occurred with type strains of the genus Reinekea, with less than 95.0 % 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequence similarities. Similarities with type strains belonging to other genera were below 92.0 %.  \n\n\n\n141 \n \n\nFor phylogenetic analyses, the sequences of closely related taxa were obtained from the EzTaxon \n\ndatabase (Kim et al., 2012). Sequence alignments were carried out with Clustal Omega (McWilliam \n\net al., 2013), and BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999) was used to edit the aligned sequences. \n\nPhylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) by using \n\nKimura\u2019s two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) in the reconstruction of neighbour-joining (NJ, \n\nSaitou &amp; Nei, 1987), maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981) and maximum parsimony (MP, \n\nFitch, 1971) trees. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replications were obtained in these phylogenetic \n\nanalyses. The topology of the ML tree was the same as the MP tree. Figure 4.3 shows that strain \n\nCPA1T forms a robust clade with the three species of the genus Saccharospirillum with validly \n\npublished names. High bootstrap values were observed, ranging from 72 to 96 %, depending on the \n\ntree building method, confirming CPA1T as a potential novel member of this genus.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 Neighbour-joining (NJ) tree showing the phylogenetic positions of strain CPA1T and representatives \n\nof other related taxa, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Filled circles indicate nodes that were also \n\nrecovered in the maximum-parsimony (MP) tree and the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree, based on the same \n\nsequences. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) ? 50 % are shown at branching \n\npoints for NJ/ML/MP trees. Amphritea atlantica M41T was used as an outgroup. Accession numbers for the \n\ntype strains are shown in parenthesis. Bar, 0.01 nt substitution rate (Knuc) units. \n\n \n\nOptimal growth conditions for strain CPA1T were determined using MA medium. The temperature \n\nrange for growth and the optimum were tested by incubating at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 \u00b0C. \n\nAt the optimum growth temperature, the pH range and optimum were assayed using pH values \n\nfrom 4 to 12, at intervals of 0.5. At the optimum growth temperature and pH, the strain\u2019s growth \n\n\n\n142 \n \n\nrequirements for, and tolerance to salt (NaCl) was assessed using the following NaCl \n\nconcentrations: 0.5 (TSA without additional NaCl), 2 (MA without additional NaCl), 3 [MA \n\nsupplemented with 1 % NaCl (w/v)], 5, 10, 12, 15 and 20 % NaCl (w/v).  \n\n \n\nGrowth in biochemical and phenotypic tests was determined on MA, and incubation was conducted \n\nat 30 \u00b0C for 48 h, unless otherwise stated. A Gram staining kit (Merck, Germany) was used according \n\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Determination of cell size, as well as morphology and motility \n\nwas carried out using light microscopy (Nikon 80i). The hanging-drop method (Bowman, 2000) was \n\nused to assess gliding motility, after growing the strain in half strength MA for 72 h, and using cavity \n\nslides. Catalase and oxidase activities were determined using H2O2-reagent (Liofilchem, Italy) and \n\noxidase strips (Liofilchem, Italy), respectively. Growth in thioglycollate medium (Merck, Germany) \n\nwas used to assess oxygen metabolism, and incubation was followed for 7 days. Production of H2S \n\nwas assessed using Kligler\u2019s Iron Agar (Merck, Germany). Ability to hydrolyse starch, casein, \n\ncellulose and xylan was assessed by methods described in Fidalgo et al. (2016).  \n\n \n\nBiochemical tests were carried out using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, \n\nFrance) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except for using 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl solution for \n\npreparing cell suspensions. Saccharospirillum impatiens DSM 12546T was tested under the same \n\nconditions for comparison. These results are given in the species description and Table 4.5. Some \n\nresults of the API 50CH tests of S. impatiens DSM 12546T differed from the original description by \n\nLabrenz et al. (2003). The differences observed may result from the use of different suspension \n\nmedium and different incubation temperatures. \n\nDetermination of G+C content was performed by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The result obtained \n\nfor strain CPA1T was 55.2 %, which is close to the values determined for other species of the genus \n\nSaccharospirillum, which are 54.5 to 54.8 mol% for S. impatiens EL-105T (Labrenz et al., 2003), 58.5 \n\nmol% for S. salsuginis YIM-Y25T (Chen et al., 2009), and 56.5 mol% for S. aestuarii IMCC 4453T (Choi \n\net al., 2011).  \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\nTable 4.5 Differential characteristics of strain CPA1T and species of the genus Saccharospirillum with validly \n\npublished names.  \n\nCharacteristic CPA1T \nS. impatiens DSM \n\n12546T \u2021 \n\nS. salsuginis \n\nYIM-Y25T \u00a7 \n\nS. aestuarii \n\nIMCC 4453T ? \n\nCell morphology Spirilla Spirilla a Spirilla Curved rods \n\nMotility Motile Motile a Motile Non motile \n\nRelation to oxygen \nObligately \n\naerobic \n\nAerobic to \n\nmicroaerophilic a \n\nObligately \n\naerobic \n\nFacultatively \n\nanaerobic \n\nTemperature range 18?42.5 \u00b0C &lt;2.5?43 \u00b0C a 15?50 \u00b0C 10?42 \u00b0C \n\npH range 5?11.5 5.5?9.5 a 6?10 5?12 \n\nNaCl (w/v) range 0.5?5 % &lt;1?15 % a \u2020 1?15 % 0.5?10 % \n\nH2S production ? + a ? ? \n\n     \n\nHydrolysis of:     \n\n   Casein + nd ? + \n\n   Starch ? variable a ? ? \n\n   Carboxymethyl cellulose ? nd nd + \n\n     \n\nAPI 20NE results:     \n\n   Hydrolysis of gelatin + ? * ? + \n\n   Reduction of nitrates to nitrites ? ? * + + \n\n   Indole production ? ? + ? \n\n   Assimilation of D-Mannose  \n\n   and D-Maltose \n? ? + nd \n\n   Assimilation of Malic acid ? ? * + nd \n\n     \n\nAPI ZYM results:     \n\n   Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase \n\n   (C4), Esterase lipase (C8),  \n\n   ?-Glucosidase \n\n+ w + nd \n\n   Naphthol-AS-BI- \n\n   phosphohydrolase,  \n\n   ?-Galactosidase \n\nw w + nd \n\n   Leucine arylamidase + + * + nd \n\n   Acid phosphatase + ? + nd \n\n   N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase + ? nd nd \n\n   ?-fucosidase w ? nd nd \n\n     \n\nAPI 50CH results:     \n\n   D-Ribose, D-Galactose,  \n\n   D-Glucose, D-Fructose,  \n\n   D-Mannose, D-Cellobiose,  \n\n   D-Maltose, D-Trehalose,  \n\n   Glycogen, L-Rhamnose,  \n\n   D-Lactose (bovine),  \n\n   D-Saccharose (sucrose) \n\n? ? * + nd \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\n   Inositol, D-Manitol, D-Sorbitol,  \n\n   L-Arabinose, D-Raffinose \n? ? + nd \n\n   Glycerol, Salicin ? ? * ? nd \n\n   Aesculin ferric citrate,  \n\n   D-Melibiose, Starch,  \n\n   D-Turanose, D-Fucose,  \n\n   Gentiobiose \n\n? ? * nd nd \n\n     \n\nDNA G+C content (mol%) 55.2 54.5 - 54.8 a 58.5 56.5 \n\n+, Positive; w, weakly positive; ?, nega?ve; nd, not determined; a, data from Labrenz et al.

(2014) and performed in parallel with similar assessments of S. impatiens DSM 12546T. To \n\nobtain cells for fatty acid profile determination, growth was obtained on MA at 30 \u00b0C for 48 h. The \n\nmain fatty acids observed for strain CPA1T were C16:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 \n\n?6c), which add up to over 78 % of the total (complete profile in Table 4.6). Summed features arise \n\nwhen the equivalent chain length value obtained corresponds to a fatty acid that cannot be \n\nseparated from another fatty acid. Consequently, the relative concentration of the possible two or \n\nmore fatty acids is given as a singular value (da Costa et al., 2011). The results are in accordance \n\nwith what has previously been described for the genus. Growth for determination of quinones and \n\npolar lipids was obtained using Marine Broth (MB) and incubating at 30 \u00b0C for 72 h. The main \n\nquinone detected was Q-8, which is in accordance with data for the genus. Q-9 was also detected, \n\nbut in minor amounts. The polar lipid profiles obtained for strain CPA1T and S. impatiens DSM \n\n12546T were very similar, suggesting that both strains belong to the same genus (Supplementary \n\nFigure S4.3). The lipids phosphatidylethanolamine, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine and \n\nphosphatidylcholine were identified in the profile of strain CPA1T, but diphosphatidylglycerol and \n\nphosphatidylglycerol were not detected. \n\n  \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\nTable 4.6 Fatty acid composition of CPA1T and type strains of species of the genus Saccharospirillum.  \n\nFatty acid CPA1T \nS. impatiens \n\nDSM 12546T * \n\nS. impatiens \n\nEL-105T \u2020 \nS. salsuginis \n\nYIM-Y25T \u2021 \nS. aestuarii \n\nIMCC 4453T \u00a7 \nUnknown ECL      \n\n   15.272 tr 2.2 ? ? ? \n   17.314 1.7 ? ? ? ?       \nSaturated      \n\n   C12:0 aldehyde ? ? ? ? 4.2 \n   C14:0 1.5 tr ? tr tr \n   C16:0 31.4 27.4 19.0 11.4 24.3 \n   C17:0 tr tr ? 1.2 tr \n   C18:0 tr tr ? ? 1.1       \nUnsaturated      \n\n   C16:1 ?7c ? ? 21.8 ? ? \n   C17:1 ?6c ? tr ? 1.2 tr \n   C17:1 ?8c tr tr ? 2.3 tr \n   C18:1 ?7c ? ? 51.2 53.4 ? \n   C19:1 ? ? 1.9 ? ?       \nBranched-chain      \n\n   iso-C14:0 3-OH ? ? ? 1.4 ? \n   iso-C16:0 tr tr ? 13.3 7.9 \n   iso-C18:0 ? ? ? tr 1.5 \n   iso-C18:1 H ? ? ? 1.2 ?       \nHydroxyl      \n\n   C14:0 3-OH ? ? 1.6 ? ? \n   C14:1 3-OH ? ? 2.3 ? ? \n      \nCyclic      \n\n   cyclo-C17:0 4.0 tr ? ? tr \n   cyclo-C19:0 ?8c 2.1 ? ? 1.4 tr \n      \nSummed feature      \n\n   2 5.4 2.8 ? 3.8 ? \n   3 3.3 15.9 ? ? ? \n   8 46.8 44.5 ? ? 46.6 \n   3a ? ? ? 5.2 6.7 \n   7b ? ? ? ? 1.4 \n\nValues represent percentage of total fatty acids.

This \n\nnovel strain is distinguishable from other species in the genus with validly published names, and \n\nthese differentiating characteristics are listed in Table 4.5. As the threshold for genomic delineation \n\nof a novel species (97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; Stackebrandt &amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne \n\net al., 1987) was not surpassed, there was no need for DNA-DNA relatedness tests. So, CPA1T is \n\nsuggested to represent a novel species of the genus Saccharospirillum, and the name \n\nSaccharospirillum correiae sp. nov. is proposed. \n\n \n\nDescription of Saccharospirillum correiae sp. nov. \n\nSaccharospirillum correiae (cor.rei\u2019ae.

Both presented optimum growth at 30 \u00b0C, pH 7.0\u20137.5 \n\nand 1\u20132 % NaCl (w/v) for strain CPA5T, and pH 7.5\u20138.0 and 2 % NaCl (w/v) for strain BR75T. \n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated both strains to the genus \n\nAltererythrobacter. CPA5T presented highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with \n\nAltererythrobacter aestuarii KYW147T (96.5 %), followed by Altererythrobacter namhicola KYW48T \n\n(95.9 %), Novosphingobium indicum H25T (95.6 %), and Altererythrobacter oceanensis Y2T (95.5 %). \n\nBR75T displayed highest similarity with Altererythrobacter marensis MSW-14T (96.5 %), followed by \n\nAltererythrobacter xinjiangensis S3-63T, Altererythrobacter luteolus SW-109T and \n\nAltererythrobacter indicus MSSRF26T (96.1 %). Neither strain contained Bacteriochlorophyll a. The \n\nmain fatty acids observed for CPA5T were C17:1 ?6c and summed features 3 (C16:1 ?7c and/or iso-\n\nC15:0 2-OH) and 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c). The latter summed feature was the dominant fatty \n\nacid observed for strain BR75T as well. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, \n\nunidentified phospholipids and unidentified glycolipids for both strains. The predominant \n\nubiquinone was Q-10 for both strains, and the DNA G+C content was 63.4 mol% and 58.3 mol% for \n\nCPA5T and BR75T, respectively. Based on phenotypic and genotypic results, both strains represent \n\nnovel species belonging to the genus Altererythrobacter for which the names Altererythrobacter \n\nhalimionae sp. nov. (type strain CPA5T = CECT 9130T?=?LMG 29519T) and Altererythrobacter \n\nendophyticus sp. nov (type strain BR75T = CECT 9129T?=?LMG 29518T) are proposed. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nErythrobacteraceae, endophytic, halophytes, taxonomy \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n153 \n \n\nMain text \n\nThe genus Altererythrobacter was described in 2007 (Kwon et al., 2007), emended in 2012 (Xue et \n\nal., 2012), and 2016 (Xue et al., 2016), and belongs to the family Erythrobacteraceae (Lee et al., \n\n2005). At the time of writing the genus contains 22 validly published species, several of which \n\nfrequently isolated from marine and estuarine environments (e.g. Lai et al., 2009; Seo &amp; Lee, 2010; \n\nPark et al., 2011; Park et al., 2016). Its occurrence in association with plants is rare and there is only \n\none species that has been isolated from the rhizosphere of wild rice (Kumar et al., 2008). \n\nThe genus Altererythrobacter comprises Gram-negative bacteria that do not produce H2S. Cells \n\ncannot grow in anaerobic conditions and nitrate is not reduced. Cell suspensions and colonies are \n\nyellow, and the methanol-soluble pigment indicates absence of Bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a). The \n\nmain quinone is Q-10 (Kwon et al., 2007) and the major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, \n\nphosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and sphingoglycolipid (Xue et al., 2012). The DNA G+C \n\ncontent range is 54.5\u201367.5 mol%, and catalase reaction can be positive or negative (Xue et al., 2016). \n\nThe major fatty acids include C18:1 ?7c (Kwon et al., 2007), C16:1 ?7c and C17:1 ?6c. \n\nThe diversity of the endophytic community of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides was assessed \n\nin a salt marsh in Aveiro, Portugal. Briefly, healthy specimens of the halophyte were collected, \n\naboveground and belowground tissues from these specimens were separated, surface-sterilized, \n\nmacerated in phosphate buffer solution and studied for their bacterial diversity (Fidalgo et al., \n\n2016). This study focuses on two strains obtained in those isolation efforts: strain CPA5T, isolated \n\nfrom the aboveground tissues; and BR75T, isolated from the belowground tissues of the halophyte. \n\nStrains CPA5T and BR75T were originally isolated from and routinely cultured on Marine Agar (MA, \n\nDifco Laboratories, France) culture medium, at 28 \u00b0C, under aerobic conditions.  \n\nGenomic DNA was extracted, subjected to PCR amplification for 16S rRNA gene, and sequenced as \n\ndescribed elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016). The primers 27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., \n\n2006) were used for sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The nearly full length sequences obtained for \n\nCPA5T (1412 nt) and BR75T (1406 nt) were used for similarity analyses using the Identify tool present \n\nin the EzTaxon platform (Kim et al., 2012). For strain CPA5T, the closest matches were observed \n\nwith type strains Altererythrobacter aestuarii KYW147T (96.5 % similarity of the 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequence), followed by Altererythrobacter namhicola KYW48T (95.9 %), Novosphingobium indicum \n\nH25T (95.6 %), and Altererythrobacter oceanensis Y2T (95.5 %). For strain BR75T, the most closely \n\nrelated type strains were Altererythrobacter marensis MSW-14T (96.5 %), followed by \n\nAltererythrobacter xinjiangensis S3-63T and Altererythrobacter luteolus SW-109T (96.1 %) and \n\n\n\n154 \n \n\nAltererythrobacter indicus MSSRF26T (96.1 %). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity percentages to \n\nother type strains were below 95.5 % and 96.0 % for CPA5T and BR75T, respectively.  \n\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains CPA5T and BR75T were aligned with sequences of related \n\ntype strains, retrieved from the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012). The sequences were then \n\naligned using Clustal Omega (McWilliam et al., 2013) and edited using BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, \n\n1999). MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) was used to cluster the sequences applying different \n\nmethods: neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, \n\n1981). The Kimura two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) was used in clustering, and bootstrap \n\nvalues based on 1000 replications were obtained in these phylogenetic analyses. The obtained \n\nphylogenetic trees clearly placed both strains in independent clusters in the genus \n\nAltererythrobacter (Figure 4.4). A more extended overview of the placement of strains CPA5T and \n\nBR75T in the context of the family Erythrobacteraceae is represented in Supplementary Figure S4.4.  \n\nThe optimal conditions for growth were tested using a base of MA medium. The range and optimum \n\nconditions were tested for temperature first, then pH and finally for NaCl concentration. Tests were \n\nperformed by incubating strains at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 \u00b0C, pH from 4 to 12 in 0.5 intervals, \n\nand NaCl tolerance was tested using concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % NaCl (w/v) \n\nin a medium composed of 5 g L-1 yeast extract (Alfa Aesar, Massachusetts, USA) and 10 g L-1 tryptone \n\ncasein peptone (Amresco, Texas, USA). Optimum temperature for growth was observed at 30 \u00b0C for \n\nboth strains. Optimum growth for CPA5T was observed at pH 7-7.5 and 1\u20132 % NaCl (w/v), and for \n\nstrain BR75T at pH 7.5-8 and 2 % NaCl (w/v). \n\nBiochemical and phenotypic tests were performed with cells grown on MA medium for 48 h, at 30 \n\n\u00b0C. Gram staining reaction was performed with a kit, and manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Merck, \n\nGermany) were followed. Catalase and oxidase activities were assessed using the H2O2-reagent and \n\noxidase strips, respectively (both from Liofilchem, Italy). Light microscopy was used for \n\ndetermination of cell size, morphology and motility. Additionally, cells grown in half-strength MA \n\nfor 72 h were placed on cavity slides and gliding motility was assessed by hang-drop method \n\n(Bowman, 2000). Oxygen metabolism was assessed by observing growth on thioglycollate medium \n\n(Merck, Germany) for 7 days. The ability to produce H2S was assessed using Kligler\u2019s Iron Agar \n\n(Merck, Germany). Ability to hydrolyse starch, Tween 20, xylan, casein and cellulose, and to produce \n\nindole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were assessed as described in Fidalgo et al. (2016). \n\n\n\n155 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Neighbour-joining (NJ) tree showing the phylogenetic positions of strains CPA5T and BR75T and \n\nrepresentatives of other related taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Bar, 0.005 nt substitution \n\nrate (Knuc) units. \n\n \n\nTo assess presence of Bacteriochlorophyll a and absorbance peaks of the pigments, cells were \n\ngrown on Marine Broth (MB), washed once with distilled water, vigorously ressuspended in 90 % \n\n(v/v) acetone and centrifuged. The supernatant was then removed and kept at 4 \u00b0C in the dark \n\novernight. Absorption peaks were assessed from 300 to 800 nm using the Thermo Spectroscopy \n\nGenesys 6.  \n\n\n\n156 \n \n\nAdditional biochemical tests were performed for strains CPA5T, BR75T as well as type strains \n\nAltererythrobacter marensis KCTC 22370T and Altererythrobacter aestuarii KCTC 22735T, using API \n\n20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, \n\nexcept for using 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl to prepare inocula. The results for biochemical and phenotypic \n\ntests are detailed in the description of the new species, and differentiating characteristics are stated \n\nin Table 4.7.  \n\n \n\nThe assessment of respiratory quinones, polar lipids and profile for fatty acids was conducted as \n\ndescribed in Proen\u00e7a et al. (2014) and performed with strains CPA5T, Altererythrobacter aestuarii \n\nKCTC 22735T, BR75T and Altererythrobacter marensis KCTC 22370T simultaneously. Cells were \n\ngrown in MB at 30 \u00b0C for 48 h to obtain biomass for quinone and polar lipids assays. The main \n\nquinone detected for all strains was Q-10, and Q-9 and Q-8 were detected in minor amounts. The \n\nmain fatty acids observed for CPA5T were C17:1 ?6c (13.8 %) and summed features 3 (C16:1 ?7c \n\nand/or iso-C15:0 2-OH; 21.4 %) and 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c; 32.6 %), comprising over 67 % of \n\ntotal fatty acids. For strain BR75T the main fatty acids were comprised in summed feature 8, \n\nrepresenting 76.3 % of total fatty acids. The results are in accordance to what is observed in other \n\nAltererythrobacter species, seen as the characteristic fatty acid of the genus (C18:1 ?7c) is present \n\nin summed feature 8 of our analysis. The complete fatty acid composition for all tested strains is \n\npresented in Table 4.8. The polar lipid profiles obtained are depicted in Supplementary Figure S4.5. \n\nFor strain CPA5T the polar lipids detected in major amounts included phosphatidylethanolamine \n\n(PE), an unidentified glycolipid (GL2) and three unidentified phospholipids (PL2, PL3 and PL5). The \n\nprofile for the phylogenetically close relative A. aestuarii KCTC 22735T was similar to that obtained \n\nfor strain CPA5T, albeit presenting small differences in regards to the minor polar lipids. For strain \n\nBR75T, the major polar lipids were PE, an unidentified glycolipid (GL2) and four unidentified \n\nphospholipids (PL2, PL3, PL4 and PL5). The profile was highly similar to that of A. marensis KCTC \n\n22370T and only discrepancies in polar lipids in minor amounts were observed. These results further \n\nindicate that strains CPA5T and BR75T belong to the genus Altererythrobacter but present slight \n\ndifferences with the most closely related strains. Determination of G+C content was performed by \n\nHPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The results obtained (63.4 mol% for CPA5T and 58.3 mol% BR75T) are \n\nin agreement with what has been previously observed in the genus (54.5 to 67.5 mol%; Xue et al., \n\n2016).   \n\n\n\n157 \n \n\nTable 4.7 Differential characteristics of strains CPA5T, BR75T, and related type strains (data from this study \n\nunless otherwise stated).  \n\nCharacteristic CPA5T BR75T \nA. aestuarii \n\nKCTC 22735T \n\nA. marensis \n\nKCTC 22370T \n\nMotility + + ? a + b \n\nCatalase activity + + + a w b \n\nHydrolysis of casein ? + ? a ? b \n\nNaCl (w/v) range  0?5 % 0?5 % 0?6 % a 0?9 % b \n\npH range 5?11.5 5?11.5 5?11 a 6.1?11.1 b \n\nTemperature range 18?37 \u00b0C 18?37 \u00b0C 10?40 \u00b0C a 4?42 \u00b0C b \n\n     \n\nAPI 20NE results:     \n\n   Reduction of nitrates to nitrites ? ? + \u2020 ? \n\n   ?-galactosidase (para-nitrophenyl-?-D- \n\n   galactopyranose)  \n? + ? ? \n\n   Assimilation of malic acid ? + ? + \n\n     \n\nAPI ZYM results:     \n\n   Esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8),  \n\n   ?-chymotrypsin \n+ + + \u2020 + \n\n   Lipase (C14) + w ? ? \n\n   Valine arylamidase + + w \u2020 + \n\n   Cystine arylamidase w ? ? w \u2021 \n\n   Trypsin w ? + w \u2021 \n\n   Acid phosphatase + + ? ? \u2021 \n\n   Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase + + w \u2020 w \u2021 \n\n   ?-galactosidase ? w ? ? \n\n   ?-glucuronidase ? + ? ? \n\n   ?-glucosidase ? ? + \u2020 ? \n\n   ?-glucosidase ? + + ? \n\n     \n\nAPI 50CH results (acid production):     \n\n   Aesculin ferric citrate ? + ? * + \n\n   Salicin ? ? ? + \n\n     \n\nDNA G+C content (mol%) 63.4 58.3 67.2 a 63.1 b \n\n+, Positive; w, weakly positive; ?, negative; a, data from Seo &amp; Lee, 2010; b, data from Park et al., 2011; \u2020, \n\nresult differed from that published in Seo &amp; Lee, 2010; \u2021, result differed from that published in Park et al., \n\n2011; *, result differed from that published in Seo &amp; Lee, 2010 where it was obtained with a different \n\nmethodology. \n\n \n\n\n\n158 \n \n\nTable 4.8 Fatty acid composition of strains CPA5T, BR75T and related type strains.  \n\nFatty acid \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n5\n\nT\n \n\nB\nR\n\n7\n5\n\nT\n \n\nA\n. \n\na\ne\n\nst\nu\n\na\nri\n\ni \nK\n\nC\nT\n\nC\n \n\n2\n2\n\n7\n3\n\n5\nT\n  \n\n(t\nh\n\nis\n s\n\ntu\nd\n\ny\n) \n\nA\n. \n\na\ne\n\nst\nu\n\na\nri\n\ni \n\nK\nY\n\nW\n1\n\n4\n7\n\nT\n  \n\n(S\ne\n\no\n &amp;\n\n L\ne\n\ne\n, \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n) \n\nA\n. \n\nm\na\n\nre\nn\n\nsi\ns \n\n \n\nK\nC\n\nT\nC\n\n 2\n2\n\n3\n7\n\n0\nT\n  \n\n(t\nh\n\nis\n s\n\ntu\nd\n\ny\n) \n\nA\n. \n\nm\na\n\nre\nn\n\nsi\ns \n\n \n\nM\nS\n\nW\n-1\n\n4\nT\n \n\n(P\na\n\nrk\n e\n\nt \na\n\nl.\n, \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n) \n\nSaturated       \n\n   C15:0 1.6 ? tr 3.2 ? 1.6 \n\n   C16:0 7.1 5.8 9.0 5.8 4.9 13 \n\n   C17:0 4.7 ? tr ? ? ? \n\n   C18:0 tr 1.1 tr ? tr 3.7 \n       \nUnsaturated       \n\n   C16:1 ?5c tr ? 1.5 ? 1.4 1.9 \n\n   C17:1 ?6c 13.8 3.1 6.3 19.9 3.4 6.8 \n\n   C17:1 ?8c 1.5 tr 1.1 2.1 ? ? \n\n   C18:1 ?5c 1.3 tr 1.4 ? 2.1 2.2 \n\n   C18:1 ?7c ? ? ? 35.2 ? ? \n\n   C18:1 ?7c 11-methyl 9.4 ? 13.3 ? 24.0 ? \n       \nHydroxyl       \n\n   C14:0 2-OH 2.3 8.1 1.0 7.5 2.3 1.3 \n\n   C15:0 2-OH tr tr tr 3.5 ? ? \n\n   C16:0 2-OH ? tr 3.1 ? 1.5 1.4 \n       \nSummed feature       \n\n   3 21.4 2.6 19.4 22.7 8.7 8.8 \n\n   7 ? ? ? ? ? 52.8 \n\n   8 32.6 76.3 41.1 ? 50.4 ? \n\nValues represent percentage of total fatty acids. ?, not detected; tr, trace amount (&lt;1 %).

Considering \n\nthe phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, similarities in physiological and biochemical \n\ntraits, it is clear that CPA5T and BR75T belong to the genus Altererythrobacter. Given that the 16S \n\nrRNA sequence similarities did not surpass the threshold for genomic delimitation of a new species \n\n(97 % sequence similarity; Stackebrandt &amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne et al., 1987), there was no need to \n\nperform DNA-DNA relatedness tests. Strains CPA5T and BR75T are, nevertheless, distinguishable \n\nfrom validly published species of the genus, as they present differences in certain traits (Table 4.7). \n\nDifferences between the novel species BR75T and the closely related reference strain of A. marensis \n\ninclude the ability to hydrolyse casein, to assimilate malic acid, to produce acid from salicin, and \n\n\n\n159 \n \n\nactivity of ?-galactosidase, ?-glucosidase and ?-glucuronidase. Between CPA5T and A. aestuarii \n\ndifferences include motility and activity of lipase, acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase. Accordingly, \n\nstrains CPA5T and BR75T represent novel species of the genus Altererythrobacter, for which the \n\nnames Altererythrobacter halimionae sp. nov. and Altererythrobacter endophyticus sp. nov, \n\nrespectively, are proposed. \n\n \n\nDescription of Altererythrobacter halimionae sp. nov. \n\nAltererythrobacter halimionae (ha.li.mi.o'nae.

The strain was Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative and \n\ncatalase-positive. Optimal growth was observed at 26 \u00b0C, at pH 6\u20138 and in the presence of 2 to 3?% \n\n(w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain CPA58T \n\nbelonged to the genus Zunongwangia, with highest sequence similarity to both Zunongwangia \n\nprofunda SM-A87T and Zunongwangia mangrovi P2E16T (96.5 %), followed by Zunongwangia \n\natlantica 22II14-10F7T (95.9 %). The principal fatty acids were iso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (C16?:1 ?7c \n\nand/or iso-C15:0 2-OH) and iso-C17:0 3-OH. The major respiratory quinone was MK-6 and the DNA \n\nG+C content was 35.1 mol%. Phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses clearly placed strain \n\nCPA58T in the genus Zunongwangia. Nevertheless, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis evidenced that \n\nthe threshold for same species relatedness was not surpassed, and biochemical tests revealed \n\ndiagnostic characteristics that differentiate this strain from other type strains in the genus. Overall, \n\nthe analyses performed showed that strain CPA58T represents a novel species within the genus \n\nZunongwangia, for which the name Zunongwangia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed, with the type \n\nstrain CPA58T (?=?CECT 9128T?=?LMG 29517T). \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nFlavobacteriaceae, endophytic, salt marsh, halophytes, taxonomy \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n168 \n \n\nMain text \n\nThe genus Zunongwangia was proposed by Qin et al. (2007) and belongs to the family \n\nFlavobacteriaceae. At the time of writing, the genus included three species, isolated from different \n\nenvironments: Zunongwangia profunda from deep-sea sediment (Qin et al., 2007), Zunongwangia \n\natlantica from rhizosphere of a mangrove tree (Shao et al., 2014) and Zunongwangia mangrovi \n\nfrom deep-sea water (Rameshkumar et al., 2014). The genus is described as comprising Gram-\n\nnegative, non-motile and non-spore forming, strictly aerobic rods, catalase- and oxidase-positive, \n\nwithout flexirubin, with MK-6 as the main menaquinone, and with the following main fatty acids: \n\niso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c), iso-C17:0 3-OH, iso-C15:1 G, iso-C17:1 ?9c, \n\nC15:0, iso-C15:0 3-OH (Qin et al., 2007). An emendation to the description of the genus added that \n\nsome species require sodium ions for growth (Rameshkumar et al., 2014). \n\nIn the scope of a diversity study of endophytic bacteria of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides \n\nfrom a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, 665 isolates were obtained and characterized (Fidalgo \n\net al., 2016). The present study focuses on one of these isolates, designated strain CPA58T, isolated \n\nfrom aboveground tissues of H. portulacoides. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses \n\nshowed that strain CPA58T was closely related to the genus Zunongwangia. The aim of this study \n\nwas to determine the exact taxonomic position of strain CPA58T using a polyphasic approach, as \n\nsuggested by the minimal standards for describing new taxa in the family Flavobacteriaceae \n\n(Bernardet et al., 2002). \n\nHealthy specimens of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides were collected from a salt marsh in \n\nSeptember of 2012. Aboveground and belowground tissues from these specimens were surface-\n\nsterilized, macerated in phosphate buffer solution and studied for their bacterial diversity. The \n\nbacterial isolation was performed on three culture media: Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), \n\nMarine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, France) and R2A (Merck, Germany) (Fidalgo et al., 2016). \n\nStrain CPA58T was originally isolated from and routinely cultured on MA culture medium, at 28 \u00b0C, \n\nunder aerobic conditions. \n\n \n\nGenomic DNA was prepared using the Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo Scientific, USA) \n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed \n\nas described elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016) and sequencing was done with the universal primers \n\n27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., 2006). Sequences of related taxa were obtained from \n\n\n\n169 \n \n\nthe EzTaxon database (Yoon et al., 2016). Sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega \n\n(McWilliam et al., 2013), and edited with BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). Phylogenetic analyses \n\nwere performed using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). The Kimura two-parameter model \n\n(Kimura, 1980) was used in clustering with the neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987) and \n\nmaximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981). Bootstrap values based on 1000 replications were \n\nobtained in these phylogenetic analyses.  \n\nThe near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CPA58T was obtained (1429 nt). The 16S \n\nrRNA gene sequence similarity was highest (96.5 %) with Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87T and \n\nZunongwangia mangrovi P2E16T, followed by 95.9 % with Zunongwangia atlantica 22II14-10F7T \n\nand 95.03 % with Salegentibacter chungangensis CAU 1289T, while the similarities to other type \n\nstrains were all below 94.0 %. These results support that strain CPA58T belongs to the genus \n\nZunongwangia. A phylogenetic tree was built, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain CPA58T \n\nand related type strains. As presented in Figure 4.6, CPA58T forms a clear monophyletic cluster with \n\nother Zunongwangia type strains, with high bootstrap support (99 ?%).  \n\n \n\nOptimal growth conditions were assessed in MA medium. Ability to grow at different temperatures \n\nwas tested by incubating at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 \u00b0C. At optimal growth temperature, the \n\npH range for growth was tested from pH 4 to 12 in 1 unit intervals. The following buffers were used \n\nto adjust the pH values: MES (4-Morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 4 to 6; Sigma, USA), Tricine (pH \n\n7 and 8; Sigma, USA), and CAPS (N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, pH 9 to 12; Sigma, \n\nUSA). At optimal growth temperature and pH, tolerance to NaCl was tested using MA at \u00bc strength \n\nas the basal medium, to test NaCl concentrations of 0.5, 1 [adding 0.5 % NaCl (w/v)], 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 \n\nand 20 % (w/v). \n\nUnless otherwise stated, cells were grown on MA supplemented with 1 % (w/v) NaCl, incubated at \n\n26 \u00b0C for 2 days. Gram staining was performed using a Gram staining set (Merck, Germany) \n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cell morphology and motility were observed using \n\nlight microscopy (Nikon 80i). Gliding motility was assessed after growing the strain in half strength \n\nMA for 72h, using cavity slides and following the hang-drop method described in Bowman (2000). \n\nThe presence of flexirubin-type pigments was assessed as described by Bowman (2000). Catalase \n\nactivity was determined using the H2O2-reagent (Liofilchem, Italy). Oxidase activity was evaluated \n\nusing oxidase strips (Liofilchem, Italy). \n\n\n\n170 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 Neighbour-joining (NJ) tree showing the phylogenetic positions of strain CPA58T and \n\nrepresentatives of other related taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.

DNA hydrolysis was determined on DNase agar \n\n(HiMedia, India) with 0.1 % toluidine blue, and supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Citrate utilization was \n\nassessed using Simmon\u2019s Citrate Agar (Oxoid, USA) supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Production of H2S \n\nwas evaluated using Kligler\u2019s Iron Agar (Merck, Germany) supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Hydrolysis \n\n\n\n171 \n \n\nof casein, starch, tween 20, cellulose and xylan, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, \n\n1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity and indole acetic acid (IAA) \n\nproduction were assessed as described by Fidalgo et al. (2016).  \n\nStrain CPA58T was Gram-stain-negative, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, non-pigmented, rod-\n\nshaped and non-motile. Growth in thioglycollate medium showed a microaerophilic behavior. \n\nOther physiological characteristics of strain CPA58T are stated in the species description section. \n\n \n\nBiochemical tests were carried out using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, \n\nFrance) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except for using 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution for \n\npreparing cell suspension. For strain CPA58T cell suspension was prepared using a 4 % (w/v) sea \n\nsalts (Sigma, USA) solution in order to accommodate the salinity requirements of this strain. \n\nZunongwangia profunda DSM 18752T and Z. mangrovi DSM 24499T were tested for comparison. \n\nThese results are given in the species description and Table 4.9. \n\nDetermination of G+C content was performed by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The DNA G+C content \n\nof the endophytic isolate CPA58T was 35.1 mol%. The value is similar to that of Z. profunda SM-A87T \n\n(36.2 %) and Z. mangrovi P2E16T (34.3 %) that were obtained from genome data (Qin et al., 2010; \n\nRameshkumar et al., 2014). \n\nFor lipoquinone analysis, strain CPA58T was grown on marine broth (MB) at 26 \u00b0C for 72 h, and the \n\ncells were then harvested and lyophilized. Lipoquinones were then extracted and analyzed as \n\ndescribed by Proen\u00e7a et al. (2014). The major respiratory quinone of strain CPA58T was determined \n\nto be MK-6, which is in accordance with the characteristics of the genus Zunongwangia.  \n\nFor fatty acid analysis, cells were grown on MA at 26 \u00b0C for 48h, and the analysis was conducted as \n\ndescribed by Proen\u00e7a et al. (2014). The Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC System and \n\nStandard MIS Library Generation Software (SherlockMicrobial ID System, TSBA 6 database, version \n\n6.0; USA) were used. The fatty acids profile of CPA58T was produced in parallel with those of Z. \n\nprofunda DSM 18752T and Z. mangrovi DSM 24499T. The major fatty acids of strain CPA58T were \n\niso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c) and iso-C17:0 3-OH, which accounted for \n\nover 45?% of the total fatty acids.

The 16S rRNA \n\ngene sequence similarity between strain CPA58T and Z. profunda SM-A87T and Z. mangrovi P2E16T \n\nstrongly indicates that strain CPA58T belongs to the genus Zunongwangia. Strain CPA58T represents, \n\nhowever, a novel and distinct species since it can be differentiated from other type strains of the \n\ngenus on the basis of physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Additionally, organisms \n\nthat present a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity below 97 % rarely display a DNA-DNA homology \n\ngreater than 70 % (Stackebrandt &amp; Goebel, 1994), which is below the threshold for same species \n\n\n\n174 \n \n\nrelatedness (Wayne et al., 1987). On the basis of the data described above, strain CPA58T should \n\nbe regarded as representing a novel species of the genus Zunongwangia, for which the name \n\nZunongwangia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. An emended description of the genus \n\nZunongwangia is also proposed. \n\n \n\nEmended description of the genus Zunongwangia Qin et al. 2007, emend. Rameshkumar \n\net al. 2014 \n\nThe description of the genus Zunongwangia is as given by Qin et al. (2007) and Rameshkumar et al. \n\n(2014) with the following amendment: species are microaerophilic or strictly aerobic, and variable \n\nfor oxidase reaction.  \n\n \n\nDescription of Zunongwangia endophytica sp. nov. \n\nZunongwangia endophytica (en.do.phy\u2019ti.ca.

The main fatty acids are iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH, \n\nand summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c). The major respiratory quinone is MK-6. In \n\nthe API 20NE test, it can hydrolyze esculin (?-glucosidase), gelatin (protease) and para-nitrophenyl-\n\n?-D-galactopyranose (?-galactosidase) but is negative for fermentation of D-glucose, activity of \n\narginine dihydrolase, urease, indole production, reduction of nitrates to nitrites and to nitrogen, \n\nassimilation of D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-mannose, D-mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine, D-maltose, \n\npotassium gluconate, capric acid, adipic acid, malic acid, trisodium citrate and phenylacetic acid.

Genome sequencing and its \n\ncomparison indicated that five of the seven isolated strains comprised five distinct and novel \n\nspecies (average nucleotide identity &lt;0.95; in silico DNA-DNA hybridization &lt;70 %; G+C difference \n\n> 1 %). A multilocus sequence analysis was performed using gyrB, rpoD and 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequences from endophytic strains from the present study and type strains to determine their \n\nphylogenetic positions. The novel strains are facultative anaerobes, mesophilic, facultative \n\nalkaliphic and halophilic, test positive for catalase and oxidase activities, for hydrolysis of Tween 20 \n\nand phosphate, production of IAA, but do not produce H2S. Ubiquinone Q-9 is present in major \n\namounts in all strains and the major fatty acids included C16:0 and the summed feature containing \n\nC18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. The DNA G+C content ranged from 60.6 to 65.8 mol%. Genomic, \n\nbiochemical and physiological characteristics confirmed five strains as new species belonging to the \n\ngenus Salinicola, for which the names Salinicola halimionae sp. nov. (type strain CPA60T = CECT \n\n9338T = LMG 30107T), Salinicola aestuarina sp. nov. (type strain CPA62T = CECT 9339T = LMG \n\n30108T), Salinicola endophytica sp. nov. (type strain CPA92T = CECT 9340T = LMG 30109T), Salinicola \n\nhalophytica sp. nov. (type strain CR45T = CECT 9341T = LMG 30105T) and Salinicola lusitana sp. nov. \n\n(type strain CR50T = CECT 9342T = LMG 30106T) are proposed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nHalomonadaceae, endophytic, salt-marsh, halophytes, taxonomy \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n180 \n \n\nBackground \n\nHalomonadaceae family \n\nThe family Halomonadaceae belongs to the class Gammaproteobacteria and was proposed by \n\nFranzmann et al. (1988). This family was initially described as harboring non-spore forming Gram-\n\nnegative oxidase-positive rods that require NaCl for growth. Ubiquinones were determined to be \n\nthe respiratory lipoquinone class present in this family, and G+C content ranged from 52 to 68 \n\nmol%. At the time, the family was described as including the genera: Halomonas, the type genus of \n\nthe family, and Deleya (Franzmann et al., 1988). Subsequent analyses of the 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequence lead to addition of the genera Chromohalobacter and Volcaniella in the Halomonas-\n\nDeleya cluster, with reclassification of the type species of the genus Volcaniella as pertaining to the \n\ngenus Halomonas (Mellado et al., 1995). The following year, species of the genera Deleya and \n\nHalovibrio, as well as the species Paracoccus halodenitrificans, were reclassified as members of the \n\ngenus Halomonas (Dobson &amp; Franzmann, 1996). These authors also proposed the inclusion of the \n\nmonospecific genus Zymobacter (Okamoto et al., 1993) in the family Halomonadaceae.  \n\nThe fast growing genus Halomonas soon demanded a more extensive analysis to understand the \n\nrelationships of its different species. Mata et al. (2002) performed a detailed phenotypic \n\ncharacterization of the 21 Halomonas species described at the time, detailing and citing many \n\nmethodologies that are still currently used in the description of new taxa of the family \n\nHalomonadaceae. Further phylogenetic analyses based on 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences of \n\nthe three genera of the family allowed clarification of early confusion on phylogenetic positioning \n\nof species in the family Halomonadaceae: the phylogenetic positions of species of the genera \n\nChromohalobacter and Zymobacter were confirmed, and it was determined that the genus \n\nHalomonas comprehended two distinguishable phylogenetic groups (Arahal et al., 2002a). The \n\nfamily Halomonadaceae grew as novel genera were described: Carnimonas (Arahal et al., 2002a), \n\nCobetia (Arahal et al., 2002b), Halotalea (Ntougias et al., 2007), Modicisalibacter (Gam et al., 2007), \n\nSalinicola (Anan\u2019ina et al., 2007), Aidingimonas (Wang et al., 2009) and Larsenia (Le\u00f3n et al., 2014). \n\nReclassifications continued to occur as the genus Cobetia was described by reassigning a species \n\npreviously included in the genus Halomonas (Arahal et al., 2002b). In 2009, S\u00e1nchez-Porro et al. \n\ndescribed the novel genus Kushneria and proposed the reclassification of three Halomonas species \n\ninto this new genus. More reclassifications occurred in 2010, when the genus Salinicola \n\naccommodated two additional species, one previously included in the genus Halomonas and \n\nanother previously included in the genus Chromohalobacter (de la Haba et al., 2010b).  \n\n\n\n181 \n \n\nEarly on meetings of the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of the Halomonadaceae family stressed \n\nthe importance of the determination of recommended minimal standards for the description of \n\nnew taxa in the family and the importance of using a high quality full or near full length sequence \n\nof 16S rRNA gene (Vreeland &amp; Ventosa, 2003). A set of required and recommended minimal \n\nstandards to describe new Halomonadaceae members was detailed by Arahal et al. (2007). These \n\nauthors emphasized the importance of a high quality (&lt;0.5 % ambiguity) and near full length (> \n\n1400 nt) 16S rRNA gene sequence, and the importance of treeing methods, seen as different \n\nmethods may result in differences in topologies, and should be evaluated by statistical methods \n\nsuch as bootstrap analysis.  \n\nThe description of the family has been emended over time, and earlier emends were mainly \n\nconcerned with updating signature nucleotides in the 16S rRNA gene sequence that were family-\n\nspecific (Dobson &amp; Franzmann, 1996; Ntougias et al., 2007; Gam et al., 2007). However, de la Haba \n\net al. (2010a) stated that the use of signature nucleotides was an arbitrary feature, and suggested \n\nthat using the complete or almost complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene would be more \n\ncoherent. These authors investigated the phylogenetic relationships among Halomonadaceae \n\nmembers based on, not only 16S rRNA gene sequence, but also on the 23S rRNA gene sequence. It \n\nwas observed that the resolution using 23S rRNA gene sequence was higher than that observed \n\nwith 16S rRNA gene sequence, however, still not enough to resolve closely related species (de la \n\nHaba et al., 2010a). To overcome this issue, an approach based on multi locus sequence analysis \n\n(MLSA) of housekeeping genes was later proposed by de la Haba et al. (2012). These authors \n\nconcluded that the combination of the genes coding for 16S rRNA, DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) and \n\nRNA polymerase sigma 70 factor (rpoD) was adequate for MLSA analysis in the family \n\nHalomonadaceae. In fact, the 2013 update of recommended minimal standards for description of \n\nnew Halomonadaceae taxa included the MLSA approach with the three aforementioned genes \n\n(Oren &amp; Ventosa, 2013).  \n\nAt the time of writing, the most recent Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of the Halomonadaceae \n\nfamily recognized 11 genera and a total of 116 species in this family. This publication also informed \n\nthat the recommended minimal standards include those detailed by Arahal et al. (2007) \n\nsupplemented by the MLSA approach of de la Haba et al. (2012) (Oren &amp; Ventosa, 2016). \n\n  \n\n\n\n182 \n \n\nThe genus Salinicola \n\nThe genus Salinicola was introduced in the family Halomonadaceae as a monospecific genus (S. \n\nsocius) which encompasses Gram-negative rods that do not form spores, are motile by means of a \n\nsingle polar flagellum, react positively in the O/F test, and are catalase-positive and oxidase-\n\nnegative (Anan\u2019ina et al., 2007). This monospecific genus was also described as being moderately \n\nhalophilic, mesophilic, and as presenting optimal growth from 30 to 37 \u00b0C (Anan\u2019ina et al., 2007). \n\nAs described for the family, the predominant ubiquinone was Q-9 and the major fatty acids \n\ndetected were C16:1 ?7c, C16:0, C18:1 ?7c, and cyclic-C19:0. The G+C content for the type species was \n\ndetermined as 63 mol%, which is included in the range described for the family Halomonadaceae \n\n(52-68 mol%, Franzmann et al., 1988).  \n\nA polyphasic approach with analyses of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene sequences, and \n\nphenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization allowed reclassification of two species \n\npreviously assigned to the genera Halomonas (H. salaria) and Chromohalobacter (C. salarius) to the \n\ngenus Salinicola as S. salarius and S. halophilus, respectively (de la Haba et al., 2010b). These \n\nauthors included an extensive emend to the genus, of which the following features are of relevance: \n\ngrowth is observed in the range of 15 to 40 \u00b0C, respiration on fumarate, nitrate and nitrite are not \n\nobserved, Tween 20 is hydrolyzed, but casein, DNA, tyrosine and aesculin are not (de la Haba et al., \n\n2010b).  \n\nSince then, several species have been described in the genus, namely Salinicola peritrichatus (Huo \n\net al., 2013), S. zeshunii (Cao et al., 2013), S. acroporae (Lepcha et al., 2015) and S. rhizosphaerae \n\n(Raju et al., 2016). These species were mostly isolated from salt-rich environments such as salt mine \n\n(S. socius), saline water (S. salarius), solar saltern (S. halophilus), deep-sea sediment (S. \n\nperitrichatus), corals (S. acroporae) and mangrove (S. rhizosphaerae).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n183 \n \n\nMotivation \n\nOur assessment of culturable endophytic bacteria from Halimione portulacoides yielded 665 \n\nisolates (Fidalgo et al., 2016), seven of which are the focus of the present section. These isolates \n\nwere obtained from aboveground (CPA60T, CPA62T and CPA92T) and from belowground tissues \n\n(CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and RZ23) of the halophyte, and were identified as Salinicola spp. (Fidalgo et \n\nal., 2016). A preliminary assessment of the 16S rRNA gene sequence suggested that these isolates \n\ncould represent novel species of the genus Salinicola. Our aim was then to determine the exact \n\ntaxonomic position of these strains within the family Halomonadaceae and fully characterize the \n\nputative new Salinicola species using a polyphasic approach. To do so, we followed specifications \n\nof the recommended minimal standards in Arahal et al. (2007) and the most recent International \n\nCommittee on Systematics of Prokaryotes Subcommittee on the taxonomy of Halobacteriaceae and \n\nsubcommittee on the taxonomy of Halomonadaceae (Oren &amp; Ventosa, 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nStrains and culture medium \n\nEndophytic Salinicola spp. strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and RZ23 were firstly \n\nisolated and regularly cultured in Marine Agar medium (MA, Difco Laboratories, France). Closely \n\nrelated type strains of five Salinicola species were used as reference strains for comparison in \n\nphenotypic and molecular characterization tests: Salinicola socius DSM 19940T, Salinicola salarius \n\nDSM 18044T, Salinicola acroporae LMG 28587T, Salinicola halophilus CECT 5903T, and Salinicola \n\nperitrichatus JCM 18795T. The reference type strains were also maintained on MA.  \n\n \n\nDNA extraction, genome sequencing and analysis \n\nTo accomplish the minimal standards recommended by Arahal et al. (2007) and de la Haba et al. \n\n(2012), a MLSA approach was conducted. For this, DNA of endophytic strains and related type \n\nstrains of the genus Salinicola was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit \n\n(Promega, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA quality was attested by running the \n\nsamples on a 0.8 % agarose gel, and DNA quantification was determined using a Qubit fluorimeter \n\n\n\n184 \n \n\n(Thermo Scientific, USA). Whole genome sequencing was conducted at Stabvida (Portugal) using an \n\nIllumina Hiseq 2500 platform. The raw sequences were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench \n\nversion 9.5.3 using a 2 nucleotide cutoff for ambiguity limit, a 0.01 quality limit (error probability) \n\nand a minimum number of nucleotides of 30. The quality of the data was checked with the FastQC \n\ntool (Andrews, 2010) and the sequences were de novo assembled. The genomes were annotated \n\nwith the Rapid Annotation using System Technology (RAST; Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014) \n\nand the rRNA gene sequences were predicted using the RNAmmer1.2 server (Lagesen et al., 2007). \n\nThe G+C content and gene sequences for 16S rRNA, GyrB and RpoD for endophytic and related type \n\nstrains of Salinicola species were obtained from genomic sequences. Sequences for these genes \n\nfrom the recently published Salinicola rhizosphaerae MSSRFH1T and from Halomonas elongata DSM \n\n2581T were obtained from the EzTaxon database (16S rRNA gene; Kim et al., 2012) and NCBI \n\ndatabase (gyrB and rpoD; NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2016). The closest relatives based on 16S \n\nrRNA gene sequence similarity were identified against the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012). The \n\naverage nucleotide identity (ANI) and tetra-nucleotide signature correlation index (TETRA) were \n\nobtained using the online tool JSpeciesWS (Richter et al., 2016) and genome-to-genome distance \n\ncalculator (GGDC) was obtained through the web service described in Meier-Kolthoff et al. (2013).  \n\nThe 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoD gene sequences were aligned using the online tool Clustal Omega \n\n(McWilliam et al., 2013) and the alignment was edited with BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). \n\nPhylogenetic analyses were performed on the three genes separately and concatenated (Villesen, \n\n2007) using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). Clustering using neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou \n\n&amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981) methods was performed using the \n\nKimura two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980). Clustering was additionally performed using the \n\nmaximum parsimony method (MP, Fitch, 1971), and bootstrap values based on 1000 replications \n\nwere calculated in all the phylogenetic analyses.  \n\n \n\nMorphological and phenotypic assays \n\nConditions for optimal growth were assessed using the following medium (adapted from Ventosa \n\net al., 1982): 5 g L-1 proteose peptone no. 3 (Merck, USA), 10 g L-1 yeast extract (Alfa Aesar, USA), 1 \n\ng L-1 glucose (Merck, USA), and pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH (2 M; JMGS, Portugal). NaCl tolerance \n\nwas tested using concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25 and 30? % (w/v). \n\nAt the optimum NaCl concentration for growth, the temperature range and optimum was tested \n\nby incubating at 4, 15, 20, 25, 30, 37, 40 and 45 \u00b0C. At the optimal growth temperature and NaCl \n\n\n\n185 \n \n\nconcentration for growth, the pH range and optimum was assessed for pH levels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 9 \n\nand 10. For the pH assays, the medium was buffered adequately, using 4-Morpholineethanesulfonic \n\nacid (MES buffer from Sigma, USA; pH 4 to 5), piperazine-N,N?-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES \n\nbuffer from Panreac, Spain; pH 6 to 7), Tricine buffer (from Sigma, USA; pH 8 to 8.5) and 3-\n\n(Cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPSO buffer, from Sigma, USA; pH 9 to 10), \n\nall prepared at a concentration of 40 mM. The assays were conducted in 96-well plates, with 200 \n\n\u00b5L of adequate medium and an inoculum of 5 \u00b5L from a cell suspension with optical density at 590 \n\nnm (OD590) of 0.5, prepared in NaCl 0.9 % (w/v). The plates were incubated up to 7 days, and OD590 \n\nreadings were registered at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, 144 and 168 h. Growth curves were \n\ndrafted and allowed determination of optimal growth conditions. A difference of 0.1 in OD590 from \n\ntime 0 h was used as the cutoff for growth in these assays. \n\nFor the remaining tests, unless otherwise stated, strain growth was obtained on MA by incubating \n\nat 30 \u00b0C for 48 h. A Gram staining was performed using Merck\u2019s (Germany) Gram staining set, \n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Light microscopy allowed assessment of cell \n\nmorphology, size and motility. Catalase activity was determined using the H2O2-reagent, and \n\noxidase activity was evaluated using oxidase strips (both from Liofilchem, Italy). Oxygen metabolism \n\nwas assessed using thioglycollate medium (Merck, Germany) supplemented with 7.5 % NaCl, and \n\ngrowth was monitored for 7 days. DNA hydrolysis was determined on DNase agar (HiMedia, India) \n\nsupplemented with 0.1 % toluidine blue and with 7.5 % NaCl. Simmon\u2019s Citrate Agar (Oxoid, USA) \n\nsupplemented with 7.5 % NaCl was used to determine citrate utilization. Kligler\u2019s Iron Agar (Merck, \n\nGermany) supplemented with 7.5 % NaCl was used to assess production of H2S. Casein, starch, \n\ntween 20, cellulose, pectin (at pH 5 and 7) and xylan hydrolysis, phosphate solubilization, \n\nsiderophore production, ACC deaminase activity and IAA production were assessed as described in \n\nFidalgo et al. (2016). Miniaturized assays API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) \n\nwere used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except for using a 4 % sea salts (Sigma, \n\nUSA) solution to prepare cell suspensions. Closely related type strains of Salinicola species were \n\nassayed in the same conditions for comparative purposes.  \n\nThe fatty acid profile and isoprenoid quinone determination was conducted as described in Proen\u00e7a \n\net al. (2014) and performed in parallel with related Salinicola type strains. Growth for determination \n\nof isoprenoid quinones was obtained using Marine Broth (MB) and incubating at 30 \u00b0C for 72 h. The \n\nG+C content (mol%) was additionally determined by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). \n\n \n\n\n\n186 \n \n\nResults and discussion \n\nGenomic analysis \n\nThe genome annotation performed with the RAST online tool (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., \n\n2014) allowed for the determination of several important metrics regarding the sequenced \n\ngenomes, such as sequence size, information about contig number and length, genome sequencing \n\ncoverage, and G+C content (Table 4.11). Genome size varied between 3.62 and 4.63 Mbp, and the \n\nnumber of contigs varied from 13 to 120. The smallest number of contigs that contains half the \n\nsequenced genome (L50) was relatively low overall (2 to 8, and 16 for Salinicola peritrichatus JCM \n\n18795T), indicating that the Illumina Hiseq platform allows for very large read lengths, which is \n\ndesirable for this type of work.  \n\n \n\nThe G+C content obtained from genome sequence data differed from wet lab experiments in \n\nalmost all instances (Table 4.11). This difference comes from the fact that, despite the importance \n\nof this value in new taxa description, experimentally determined G+C contents are prone to \n\ninaccuracies due to measurement error and heterogeneity in methodologies (Kim et al., 2015). \n\nThese authors indicate that the difference between values obtained in wet lab experiments and \n\ngenome sequence data may differ in more than 1 %, and this is also observed in our work. The \n\nhigher accuracy that is inherent to using G+C contents obtained from genome data allows the use \n\nof the cutoff of 1 % in G+C content variation to validate the existence of a new species (Kim et al., \n\n2015), which has already been established in online tools (Richter et al., 2016). \n\nThe G+C contents observed for the endophytic strains are well within the range determined for the \n\nHalomonadaceae family (52 to 68 mol%; Franzmann et al., 1988). Although there is no range \n\nestablished for the genus Salinicola, values reported for the species previously described are within \n\na range of G+C content from 58.8 (Salinicola salarius; Kim et al., 2007) to 64.0 (Salinicola \n\nrhizosphaerae; Raju et al., 2016). Considering only the values obtained from genome sequence data \n\n\u2013 which is what will be done from this point on \u2013, the values for G+C content of the endophytic \n\nstrains are either within this range or slightly above (60.6 to 65.9, Table 4.11). Since there are only \n\nsix members of the genus validly described thus far, and that the threshold of 10 % divergence is \n\nnot crossed (Owen &amp; Pitcher, 1985), the endophytic strains may be considered to belong to the \n\ngenus Salinicola. The difference in G+C content that will allow validation of novel species is further \n\nexplored in the pairwise comparison of the endophytic strains and type strains of Salinicola.  \n\n\n\n187 \n \n\nTable 4.11 Information of sequenced genomes.  \n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n0\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n2\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n9\n\n2\nT\n \n\nR\nZ\n\n2\n3\n\n \n\nC\nR\n\n4\n5\n\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n5\n0\n\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n5\n7\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\na\ncr\n\no\np\n\no\nra\n\ne\n \n\nLM\nG\n\n 2\n8\n\n5\n8\n\n7\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nh\na\n\nlo\np\n\nh\nil\n\nu\ns \n\nC\nE\n\nC\nT\n\n 5\n9\n\n0\n3\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\np\ne\n\nri\ntr\n\nic\nh\n\na\ntu\n\ns \n\nJC\nM\n\n 1\n8\n\n7\n9\n\n5\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nsa\nla\n\nri\nu\n\ns \n \n\nD\nS\n\nM\n 1\n\n8\n0\n\n4\n4\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nso\nci\n\nu\ns \n\n \n\nD\nS\n\nM\n 1\n\n9\n9\n\n4\n0\n\nT\n \n\nSequence size (bp) ? 3996664 3875167 4360898 4375234 3904690 4420691 4302657 4377847 3620402 4628485 3888731 4095312 \n\nNumber of contigs ? 13 36 32 49 30 30 35 36 17 120 50 45 \n\nShortest contig size ? 171 149 145 125 159 342 133 137 239 174 571 134 \n\nMedian sequence size ? 31101 3158 32984 4550 3286 50400 66535 37715 36215 20551 45749 2324 \n\nLongest contig size ? 1575882 958676 902169 651083 786467 811871 593809 734116 1354622 337132 477531 1220288 \n\nN50 value ? 938409 480424 579807 280645 467686 393965 276347 303762 659543 74359 155119 482332 \n\nL50 value ? 2 3 4 6 3 4 5 4 2 16 8 3 \n\nCoverage** 613X 536X 351X 377X 374X 347X 216X 389X 376X 216X 305X 393X \n\nG+C content (mol%) ? 60.6 63.5 65.8 65.9 62.2 64.3 63.9 63.6 64.8 62.4 62.5 62.2 \n\nG+C content (mol%) \n\nfrom other sources \n66.2* 66.4* 67.7* nd 66.3* 66.9* 66.6* 63.6\u2020 63.6\u2021 59.6\u00a7 58.8|| 63.0# \n\nValues given correspond to those obtained after splitting into scaffolds. ?, data obtained from the RAST online tool; ** Coverage was calculated as L*N/G, where L is \n\nthe length of the reads, N the read number, and G the estimated genome length given by RAST; nd, not determined; * data from HPLC G+C content (mol%) \n\ndetermina?on in the present work; \u2020, data from Lepcha et al.

(2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n188 \n \n\nThe full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1528 bp) of the endophytic and related Salinicola strains \n\nwere obtained from RAST annotation. The sequences from the endophytic strains were then \n\ncompared to the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012) to obtain a 16S rRNA gene-based \n\nidentification. The results are listed in Table 4.12 and clearly place all endophytic strains in the genus \n\nSalinicola. The lowest similarity percentage observed is higher than the cutoff for delimitation of a \n\nnovel species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence (97 %, Stackebrandt &amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne et al., \n\n1987), however, this gene sequence is not the most adequate to resolve closely related species in \n\nthe family Halomonadaceae (de la Haba et al., 2010a).  \n\n \n\nTo overcome this shortcoming of the 16S rRNA gene sequence-based approach, a genome \n\nsequence-based pairwise comparison was performed, in which the value for average nucleotide \n\nidentity (ANI) of pairs of strains is obtained. The ANI value was calculated using the parameters for \n\nANIb (BLAST-based ANI), ANIm (MUMmer-based ANI), in addition to the TETRA parameter (Richter \n\n&amp; Rossell\u00f3-M\u00f3ra, 2009) with the online tool JSpeciesSW (Richter et al., 2016). According to the \n\nconsiderations of the authors of the parameters and recent evaluations (Figueras et al., 2014), ANI \n\n> 95-96 % indicates that strains belong to the same species.  \n\nA traditional methodology to assess if a pair of strains belong to the same species is to perform \n\nDNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), however this approach is prone to experimental error and has been \n\nreplaced by genome sequence-based approaches (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). These authors \n\nproposed the calculation of in silico DDH (isDDH) by genome blast distance phylogeny (GBDP) as an \n\nalternative to the traditional DDH method. This isDDH value was then calculated for the endophytic \n\nstrains against the closely related type Salinicola strains.  \n\nThe G+C content difference was also calculated using the tool proposed by Meier-Kolthoff et al. \n\n(2013) and the pairwise difference of G+C content is also used as a parameter to validate the \n\npresence of a new species. A difference in G+C content over 1 % rejects the hypothesis that the pair \n\nof strains belongs to the same species (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n\n\n189 \n \n\nTable 4.12 Length of 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from RAST annotation and best matches observed by comparison against the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., \n\n2012). \n\n CPA60T CPA62T CPA92T RZ23 CR45T CR50T CR57 \n\nLength (bp) 1529 1529 1528 1528 1529 1528 1528 \n\nBest matches \n\n(% similarity) \n\nS. socius  \n\nSMB35T  \n\n(99.09 %) \n\nS. halophilus  \n\nCG 4.1T  \n\n(98.97 %) \n\nS. peritrichatus \n\nDY22T  \n\n(98.29 %) \n\nS. peritrichatus \n\nDY22T  \n\n(98.08 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(99.38 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(99.50 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(99.50 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(99.04 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(98.50 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(97.79 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(97.57 %) \n\nS. socius  \n\nSMB35T  \n\n(98.74 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(99.25 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(99.25 %) \n\nS. zeshunii  \n\nN4T  \n\n(98.43 %)* \n\nS. zeshunii  \n\nN4T  \n\n(98.50 %)* \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(97.67 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(97.47 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(98.50 %) \n\nS. socius  \n\nSMB35T  \n\n(98.95 %) \n\nS. socius  \n\nSMB35T  \n\n(98.95 %) \n\nS. acroporae  \n\nS4-41T  \n\n(98.22 %) \n\nS. salarius  \n\nKCTC 12664T  \n\n(98.36 %) \n\nS. rhizosphaerae \n\nMSSRFH1T  \n\n(97.50 %) \n\nS. rhizosphaerae \n\nMSSRFH1T  \n\n(97.36 %) \n\nS. zeshunii  \n\nN4T  \n\n(98.29 %)* \n\nS. halophilus  \n\nCG 4.1T  \n\n(98.08 %) \n\nS. halophilus  \n\nCG 4.1T  \n\n(98.08 %) \n\n* Salinicola zeshunii is an effectively published species (Cao et al., 2013) but not validly published thus far. \n\n \n\n\n\n190 \n \n\nThe results of the genome sequence-based pairwise comparisons are given in Table 4.13 and show \n\nthat the threshold of ANI value (> 95-96 %) for species delineation is not surpassed for the \n\nendophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T and CR50T. For these strains, some TETRA values \n\nare over the threshold for species boundary (> 0.99, Richter &amp; Rossell\u00f3-M\u00f3ra, 2009), however, this \n\nparameter should only be considered when it is in agreement with ANI values greater than 95-96 \n\n% (Richter &amp; Rossell\u00f3-M\u00f3ra, 2009).  \n\nThe isDDH parameter confirms these five endophytic strains represent different species from the \n\ncurrently described in the genus Salinicola. The difference in values of G+C content between strains \n\nalso supports our claim that the endophytic strains represent novel genomic species of Salinicola, \n\nas the value of 1 % in difference is surpassed in most comparisons. According to these results, the \n\nendophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T and CR50T represent novel Salinicola species. \n\nThe endophytic strains RZ23 and CR57, however, present parameters for ANIb, ANim, TETRA, \n\nisDDH, and differences in G+C content that support that they are members of the same species as \n\nCPA92T and CR50T, respectively. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic analysis \n\nIn order to perform the MLSA approach, required for the description of new taxa in the \n\nHalomonadaceae family (Arahal et al., 2007; de la Haba et al., 2012), the full sequences of the 16S \n\nrRNA gene, gyrB and rpoD genes were retrieved from the annotated genomes of the endophytic \n\nstrains and the related Salinicola type species. Additional sequences were used, namely from the \n\nrecently published Salinicola rhizosphaerae MSSRFH1T and Halomonas elongata DSM 2581T, and \n\nthe accession numbers used are listed in Table 4.14.  \n\nPhylogenetic trees were built with NJ, ML and MP clustering methods, for each gene separately \n\n(Figure 4.6), and for the concatenated sequences of the three genes (Figure 4.7). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n191 \n \n\nTable 4.13 Pairwise comparison of genome sequence-based information of the endophytic strains and related type strains of the genus Salinicola.  \n  \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n0\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n2\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n9\n\n2\nT\n \n\nR\nZ\n\n2\n3\n\n \n\nC\nR\n\n4\n5\n\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n5\n0\n\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n5\n7\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\na\ncr\n\no\np\n\no\nra\n\ne\n \n\nLM\nG\n\n 2\n8\n\n5\n8\n\n7\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nh\na\n\nlo\np\n\nh\nil\n\nu\ns \n\nC\nE\n\nC\nT\n\n 5\n9\n\n0\n3\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\np\ne\n\nri\ntr\n\nic\nh\n\na\ntu\n\ns \n\nJC\nM\n\n 1\n8\n\n7\n9\n\n5\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nsa\nla\n\nri\nu\n\ns \nD\n\nS\nM\n\n \n\n1\n8\n\n0\n4\n\n4\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nso\nci\n\nu\ns \n\nD\nS\n\nM\n \n\n1\n9\n\n9\n4\n\n0\nT\n \n\nCPA60T ANIb ? 76.53 77.87 77.87 86.94 81.56 81.60 81.44 76.82 79.47 82.82 83.19 \n\nANIm ? 84.54 84.84 84.83 88.52 85.68 85.67 85.64 84.48 85.11 86.1 86.28 \n\nTETRA ? 0.9576 0.906 0.906 0.987 0.948 0.954 0.962 0.929 0.971 0.972 0.991 \n\nisDDH ? 21.8 23.1 23.0 32.5 24.7 24.5 24.6 22.1 23.3 26.2 26.4 \n\nProb ? 70 % ? 0 0 0 0.28 0.01 0.01 0.01 0 0 0.02 0.02 \n\nG+C dif.

The MLSA tree \n\nshows higher, albeit not complete, congruence among the three clustering methods (Figure 4.7). \n\nThis indicates that the observed topology and phylogenetic positions of the endophytic strains are \n\nrobust and stable, supporting our claim that the endophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T \n\nand CR50T are, in fact, new species of the Salinicola genus, and that strains RZ23 and CR57 belong \n\nto the same species as CPA92T and CR50T, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\n196 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 Neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree showing the phylogenetic positions of strains CPA60T, \n\nCPA62T, CPA92T, RZ23, CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and representatives of other related taxa based on the \n\nconcatenated sequences of the 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoD genes.

All strains are moderately halophilic and mesophilic, which is in accordance with \n\nwhat has been observed for validly described Salinicola species. All strains are Gram-negative, \n\ncatalase- and oxidase-positive motile rods, facultative anaerobes that do not produce H2S. Citrate \n\ndegradation was observed for all strains (weak in the case of CPA62T), as was Tween 20 hydrolysis, \n\nphosphate solubilization and IAA production. Casein was not degraded by any of the endophytic \n\nstrains.  \n\nIn the API 20NE strip, all strains were negative for reduction of nitrates to nitrites, indole \n\nproduction, fermentation of D-glucose, arginine dihydrolase, hydrolysis of gelatin (protease), and \n\nassimilation of adipic acid and phenylacetic acid. In the API ZYM strip, all strains were positive for \n\nacid and alkaline phosphatase, leucine and valine arylamidase, and negative for lipase (C14), cystine \n\n\n\n197 \n \n\narylamidase, trypsin, ?-chymotrypsin, ?-galactosidase, ?-galactosidase, ?-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-\n\n?-glucosaminidase, ?-mannosidase and ?-fucosidase. In the API 50CH strip, all strains were positive \n\nfor D-galactose, D-glucose, D-ribose, D-xylose and L-arabinose assimilation, and negative for \n\namidon (starch), amygdalin, arbutin, D-adonitol, D-arabitol, D-melezitose, D-raffinose, gentiobiose, \n\nglycogen, inositol, inulin, L-arabitol, L-fucose, L-xylose, methyl-?-D-glucopyranoside, methyl-?-D-\n\nmannopyranoside, methyl-?-D-xylopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, potassium 2-ketogluconate, \n\npotassium 5-ketogluconate, potassium gluconate, salicin and xylitol. The variable results for the \n\nremaining assays are detailed in the species description for each novel Salinicola species. \n\nThe Q-9 was the major respiratory quinone for all strains, which is in agreement with what has been \n\ndescribed for the genus. The major fatty acids overall were C16:0 and the summed feature containing \n\nC18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. The cyclo-C19:0 ?8c is also a major fatty acid but only for strains CR45\nT \n\nand CR50T. The complete fatty acid profiles of the endophytic strains and reference strains are given \n\nin Table 4.15. According to the description of the genus Salinicola, C16:1 ?7c, C16:0, C18:1 ?7c and \n\ncyclo-C19:0 are the major fatty acids (Anan\u2019ina et al., 2007). The unsaturated fatty acid C16:1 ?7c was \n\nlisted as a major fatty acid by Anan\u2019ina et al. (2007) when the genus was composed by a single \n\nspecies, despite the fact that this fatty acid comprised only 8.6 % of the total fatty acids, and has \n\nnot been considered a major fatty acid since that publication. The cyclo-C19:0 described in Anan\u2019ina \n\net al. (2007) as a major fatty acid has not had the same designation in other papers, where it has \n\nbeen referenced as cyclo-C19:0 ?8c, and has been, in fact, observed in high percentages. The C16:0 \n\nand C18:1 ?7c fatty acids have been observed as major fatty acids in every Salinicola species validly \n\npublished so far, and this is also observed with the endophytic strains, where the latter is listed \n\nunder the summed feature containing C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. A more appropriate characteristic \n\nlist of main fatty acids is given in the emended description of the genus, based not only on our \n\nresults, but also on those published since the last amendment.  \n\n \n\nConsidering the genomic, phylogenetic and biochemical and physiological characteristics, it is clear \n\nthe CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T strains are affiliated with the genus Salinicola. These \n\nstrains are, nevertheless, distinguishable from other validly described Salinicola species, and \n\ndifferentiating traits are stated in Table 4.16. Accordingly, CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T \n\nrepresent novel species of the genus Salinicola, and the names Salinicola halimionae sp. nov., \n\nSalinicola aestuarina sp. nov., Salinicola endophytica sp. nov., Salinicola halophytica sp. nov. and \n\nSalinicola lusitana sp. nov., respectively, are proposed. \n\n\n\n198 \n \n\nTable 4.15 Complete fatty acid composition of the endophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T and CR50T, and related type strains. \n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n0\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n6\n\n2\nT\n \n\nC\nP\n\nA\n9\n\n2\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n4\n5\n\nT\n \n\nC\nR\n\n5\n0\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\na\ncr\n\no\np\n\no\nra\n\ne\n  \n\nS\n4\n\n-4\n1\n\nT\n \u2020\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\nh\na\n\nlo\np\n\nh\nil\n\nu\ns \n\n \n\nC\nE\n\nC\nT\n\n 5\n9\n\n0\n3\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nh\na\n\nlo\np\n\nh\nil\n\nu\ns \n\nC\nG\n\n4\n.1\n\nT\n \u2021\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\np\ne\n\nri\ntr\n\nic\nh\n\na\ntu\n\ns \n\nJC\nM\n\n 1\n8\n\n7\n9\n\n5\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\np\ne\n\nri\ntr\n\nic\nh\n\na\ntu\n\ns \n\nD\nY\n\n2\n2\n\nT\n \u00a7\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\nsa\nla\n\nri\nu\n\ns \n \n\nD\nS\n\nM\n 1\n\n8\n0\n\n4\n4\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nsa\nla\n\nri\nu\n\ns \n \n\nM\n2\n\n7\nT\n |\n\n|\n \n\nS\n. \n\nso\nci\n\nu\ns \n\n \n\nD\nS\n\nM\n 1\n\n9\n9\n\n4\n0\n\nT\n \n\nS\n. \n\nso\nci\n\nu\ns \n\n \n\nS\nM\n\nB\n3\n\n5\nT\n #\n\n \n\nS\n. \n\nrh\niz\n\no\nsp\n\nh\na\n\ne\nra\n\ne\n \n\nM\nS\n\nS\nR\n\nF\nH\n\n1\nT\n\n \u00a5\n \n\nSaturated \n               \n\n   C10:0 tr 1.2 1.1 1.3 tr \u2013 1.1 \u2013 1.2 1.8 1.4 2.2 tr \u2013 2.4 \n\n   C12:0 2.9 3.7 1.5 3.6 2.0 4.4 3.0 tr 1.9 2.4 3.1 3.0 2.6 \u2013 4.4 \n\n   C12:0 aldehyde \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 7.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   C14:0 tr \u2013 tr tr tr 8.6 tr tr tr tr \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1.0 \n\n   C16:0 22.2 22.5 28.1 21.9 27.6 35.4 25.9 32.6 29.9 33.7 26.8 20.4 21.5 19.3 22.7 \n\n   C17:0 \u2013 tr 1.2 1.4 tr 1.1 tr \u2013 tr tr tr \u2013 tr \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   C18:0 9.9 8.1 8.4 6.7 3.6 tr 2.6 tr 2.1 2.6 2.4 1.3 3.6 \u2013 1.5                 \nUnsaturated \n\n               \n\n   C16:1 ?7c \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 8.6 \u2013 \n\n   C18:1 ?7c \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1.7 \u2013 43.0 \u2013 7.0 \u2013 33.6 \u2013 46.7 33.7 \n\n   C18:1 ?7c 11-methyl \u2013 tr \u2013 tr 1.0 tr 1.2 tr 1.6 1.0 1.2 \u2013 1.2 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   C20:2 ?6,9c \u2013 tr \u2013 tr tr tr tr \u2013 1.2 tr tr \u2013 tr \u2013 \u2013                 \nBranched-chain \n\n               \n\n   anteiso-C15:0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.2 1.9 tr \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   anteiso-C17:0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1.3 tr tr \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   iso-C16:0 \u2013 tr \u2013 tr tr \u2013 tr \u2013 \u2013 tr tr \u2013 1.0 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   iso-C18:0 10(11)-methyl \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1.1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n  \n\n\n\n199 \n \n\nCyclic  \n               \n\n   cyclo-C17:0 \u2013 1.3 \u2013 3.3 2.3 24.4 3.5 1.7 5.2 4.0 4.0 2.9 1.7 \u2013 1.9 \n\n   cyclo-C19:0 ?8c 1.3 12.4 8.1 25.5 30.6 6.1 23.3 11.1 42.9 29.0 26.3 18.3 21.9 7.4* 14.0                 \nHydroxyl \n\n               \n\n   C12:0 2-OH tr 1.0 tr tr 1.9 \u2013 1.3 \u2013 1.7 3.5 1.4 \u2013 1.9 \u2013 tr \n\n   C12:0 3-OH 6.5 7.4 6.3 6.0 6.1 tr 8.1 tr 5.4 10.1 8.4 8.3 7.8 \u2013 5.0 \n\n   C14:0 2-OH \u2013 \u2013 1.7 tr \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 tr \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   C14:0 3-OH/iso-C16:1 I \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 7.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013                 \nSummed feature \n\n               \n\n   2  tr 2.3 2.1 2.8 2.3 \u2013 tr \u2013 \u2013 tr tr \u2013 1.9 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   3  10.5 5.4 4.6 1.6 tr \u2013 5.0 10.1 1.0 1.7 3.7 10.0 3.8 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   8  44.1 33.2 34.6 18.0 12.2 \u2013 20.9 \u2013 4.4 \u2013 18.5 \u2013 28.7 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   Sa \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.5 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n\n   Sr 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 4.3 \n\n   Sr 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 5.3 \n\nSummed feature 2 contains C12:0 aldehyde, C14:0 3-OH and/or iso-C16:1 and/or Unknown Equivalent Chain Length (ECL) 10.927; summed feature 3 contains C16:1 ?7c \n\nand/or iso-C15:0 2-OH; summed feature 8 contains C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c; summed feature Sa (Salinicola acroporae, from Lepcha et al., 2015) contains C16:1 ?7c \n\nand/or C16:1 ?6c; summed feature Sr 1 (Salinicola rhizosphaerae, from Raju et al., 2016) contains C14:0 3-OH/isso-C16:1 I; summed feature Sr 2 (Raju et al., 2016) contains \n\nC16:1 ?7c/C16:1 ?6c. * Referred as cyclo-C19:0 w8c in Anan\u2019ina et al.

Surface-sterilized aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) tissues of the halophyte were \n\nanalyzed for their diversity of endophytic bacteria using a culture-independent high-throughput \n\n16S rRNA gene sequencing method. The interference of host DNA in the analysis was decreased by \n\nincluding PNA blockers in the 16S rRNA gene amplification reaction. The methodology used allowed \n\nfor a high sequencing coverage for all samples (median 97.5 %) and revealed a high operational \n\ntaxonomic units (OTUs) richness (median of 200 OTUs per sample). Results showed significant \n\ndifferences according to sampling tissue, where BG tissues presented higher OTU richness and \n\ndiversity. Community structure was also found to differ according to sampling tissue, and this \n\ndifference may be associated with a large number of rare OTUs. Overall, the main phyla observed \n\nin the endosphere of the halophyte were Proteobacteria (62.5 % OTUs), Bacteroidetes (10.7 %), \n\nPlanctomycetes (8.8 %), Actinobacteria (5.2 %) and Firmicutes (2.4 %). Core endophytome analyses \n\nrevealed that the AG tissues mainly comprised members of the family Oceanospirillaceae, and also \n\nincluded the families Flammeovirgaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae, while the BG \n\nendophytome was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Kiloniellaceae. This work explored the \n\ndiversity of the bacterial endophytome of H. portulacoides in depth and confirmed it as a bacterial \n\nhotspot. Putative ecological functions of the dominant taxa revealed a community that presented \n\nseveral plant growth promotion traits. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n218 \n \n\nBackground \n\nPlant-associated microbes are ecologically relevant due to their roles in various processes including \n\nnutrient acquisition and cycling, protection against pathogens, and production of traits that allow \n\nthe plant to thrive (Hardoim et al., 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). In order to understand the potential \n\nof a plant host, it should be seen as a holobiont, thus requiring an extensive knowledge of the \n\nstructure and diversity of the complex host-associated microbial community (reviewed in \n\nVandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). Culture-based methodologies have been thoroughly used to \n\ncharacterize such communities, however, this approach relies on the ability of the microbes to grow \n\nin laboratory conditions. This conditioning, whether in terms of nutrient availability, temperature, \n\npressure, or other conditions, usually results in a collection of microbes that represents a minor \n\nfraction of the community (Amann et al., 1995; Tanaka et al., 2014). \n\nRecent advances in amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing and its broad application have \n\nallowed for a more comprehensive assessment of plant-associated bacterial communities. The \n\nfocus of these studies has been largely aimed at the microbes present in the rhizospheric portion, \n\nsince this type of environment is very abundant in ecologically relevant microbes (Philippot et al., \n\n2013). The endosphere, albeit also rich in relevant microbes (Hardoim et al., 2015), has been less \n\nexplored. The reason for this may be attributed to the impairment caused by the presence of plant \n\norganelle DNA in the samples used in endophytic bacterial diversity assessments. In healthy plant \n\nspecimens, these samples present a low ratio of bacterial:host cells, and the latter may contain up \n\nto tens of thousands of organelle genomes in each cell, depending on the plant species (Bendich, \n\n1987). Since organelle genomes contain DNA sequences similar to the widely used 16S rRNA gene \n\nfor bacterial identification, the molecular-based techniques often result in an output rich in \n\norganelle reads, and less so in bacterial reads. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n219 \n \n\nMotivation \n\nOur assessment of culturable endophytic bacteria from Halimione portulacoides yielded 665 \n\nisolates (Chapter 3), and it is considered that the culturable fraction shows a small fraction of the \n\ndiversity within a microbial community (Amann et al., 1995). Since the main purpose of the present \n\nwork was to have an understanding of the bacterial diversity in the halophyte H. portulacoides, it \n\nwas our aim to explore this diversity using a culture-independent, molecular-based, high-\n\nthroughput technique. Since the diversity of culturable bacteria exhibited significant differences in \n\nabovegound and belowground tissues, here we also focused on the exploration of these \n\ncompartments separately.  \n\nOur aim was, then, to achieve a deeper understanding of the bacterial diversity present in the \n\nsurface-sterilized AG and BG tissues of H. portulacoides collected in Ria de Aveiro. This will allow us \n\nto determine the core bacterial endophytome associated with the halophyte.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n220 \n \n\nMethods \n\nStudy area and sampling  \n\nSampling was performed in a salt marsh in the estuary Ria de Aveiro (40\u00b0 38? 05.36? N, 8\u00b0 39? 38.87? \n\nW; site C from Chapter 3) during low tide in December 2015 (average temperature 11 \u00b0C). Fifteen \n\nhealthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides were collected in monospecific stands, in the \n\ndesign exposed in Figure 5.1. Three roughly equidistant plots were chosen for sampling. From each \n\nof the three plots, five whole plants were extracted from three monospecific stands of H. \n\nportulacoides: three plants from stand A, one plant from stand B and one plant from stand C. This \n\ndifferential sampling was performed to understand if the community was affected by the sampling \n\nstand. Samples were transported to the laboratory and promptly processed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Schematics of the sampling strategy to obtain fifteen specimens of Halimione portulacoides from \n\nRia de Aveiro. Three roughly equidistant plots were chosen (Plot 1, 2 and 3), and in each plot three \n\nmonospecific stands of H. portulacoides were sampled: in the first stand (stand A) three specimens of the \n\nhalophyte were collected, and one specimen from stand B and another from stand C were collected.  \n\n\n\n221 \n \n\nSample processing, DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene amplification and amplicon sequencing \n\nIn the laboratory, the fifteen plants were washed with running tap water and the AG tissues were \n\nseparated from BG tissues, resulting in 30 individual samples. A detailed description of the 30 \n\nsamples is given in Table 5.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 Description of the samples used in the study.  \n\n Sample description \n\nSample Plot Stand Specimen  Tissue \n\n1 1 A 1 AG \n\n2 1 A 1 BG \n\n3 1 A 2 AG \n\n4 1 A 2 BG \n\n5 1 A 3 AG \n\n6 1 A 3 BG \n\n7 1 B 4 AG \n\n8 1 B 4 BG \n\n9 1 C 5 AG \n\n10 1 C 5 BG \n\n11 2 A 1 AG \n\n12 2 A 1 BG \n\n13 2 A 2 AG \n\n14 2 A 2 BG \n\n15 2 A 3 AG \n\n16 2 A 3 BG \n\n17 2 B 4 AG \n\n18 2 B 4 BG \n\n19 2 C 5 AG \n\n20 3 C 5 BG \n\n21 3 A 1 AG \n\n22 3 A 1 BG \n\n23 3 A 2 AG \n\n24 3 A 2 BG \n\n25 3 A 3 AG \n\n26 3 A 3 BG \n\n27 3 B 4 AG \n\n28 3 B 4 BG \n\n29 3 C 5 AG \n\n30 3 C 5 BG \n\nAG, aboveground tissues; BG, belowground tissues. \n\n \n\n\n\n222 \n \n\nSurface sterilization was performed as described before (Chapter 3) and aliquots (100 \u00b5L) of water \n\nfrom the last wash were used as inoculum in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany) medium. The \n\nabsence of growth after 7 days incubating at 30 \u00b0C confirmed the efficacy of the sterilization \n\nprocedure.  \n\nPortions of the samples were macerated using a micro-pestle in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. DNA \n\nextraction was conducted using the MoBio PowerPlant DNA Isolation kit (USA) according to the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions with the exception that the DNA was eluted in PCR-grade water (Sigma, \n\nUSA) in the final step. DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using NanoDrop \n\nND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using 25 \n\nng of template DNA, 0.2 \u00b5M of primer 341F (5\u2019-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3\u2019; Muyzer et al., 1993) \n\nand 805R (5\u2019-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3\u2019; Skirnisdottir et al., 2000), 2 \u00b5M of mPNA and pPNA \n\n(Lundberg et al., 2013; PNAbio, USA), and 2X KAPA HiFi Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems, USA). Prior to \n\nusing the mPNA and pPNA in the reaction, these reagents were allowed to solubilize at 55 \u00b0C for 30 \n\nmin. Conditions for amplification were as follows: one cycle at 95 \u00b0C (3 min), followed by 30 cycles \n\nat 98 \u00b0C (20 sec), 75 \u00b0C (10 sec), 55 \u00b0C (30 sec) and 72 \u00b0C (30 sec), with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C (5 \n\nmin). The PCR amplification was also conducted on a randomly chosen sample (sample 11) without \n\naddition of the mPNA and pPNA reagents, in order to understand the effect of the PNA blockers in \n\nthe Illumina MiSeq sequencing results. This sample is regarded from now on as sample -PNA, and \n\nthe 30 samples for which the PCR reactions were performed with addition of PNA blockers are \n\nregarded as +PNA. \n\nAt the sequencing company (Biocant, Portugal), the samples were subjected to an electrophoresis \n\non agarose gel [1 % (w/v)] and the 490 bp amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads \n\n(Agencourt, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. A second PCR reaction added indexes \n\nand sequencing adaptors to both ends of the amplified target region using 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart \n\nReady Mix, 5 \u00b5L of each index (i7 and i5) (Nextera XT Index Kit, Illumina, USA) and 5 \u00b5L of the first \n\nPCR product in a total volume of 50 \u00b5L. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C (3 min), eight \n\ncycles of 95 \u00b0C (30 sec), 55 \u00b0C (30 sec) and 72 \u00b0C (30 sec), and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C (5 min). \n\nElectrophoresis of the PCR products was undertaken on an agarose gel [1 % (w/v)] and the 550 bp \n\namplified fragments were purified using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, USA) according to \n\nmanufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were quantified by fluorimetry with PicoGreen dsDNA \n\nquantitation kit (Invitrogen, USA), pooled at equimolar concentrations and pair-end sequenced \n\nusing an Illumina Miseq V3 platform, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina, USA). \n\n\n\n223 \n \n\nData processing and analysis \n\nAt the sequencing company, the sequenced reads were demultiplexed automatically by the \n\nIllumina Miseq sequencer using the CASAVA package (Illumina, USA) and quality-filtered with \n\nPRINSEQ software (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) using the following parameters: (i) bases with \n\naverage quality lower than Q25 in a window of 5 bases were trimmed, and (ii) reads with less than \n\n150 bases were discarded. The forward and reverse reads were merged by overlapping paired-end \n\nreads using the AdapterRemoval v2.1.5 (Schubert et al., 2016) software with default parameters.  \n\nThe QIIME pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010) was used to further process the reads. For the +PNA \n\nsamples, the 30 separate sequence files were merged into a single fasta file using the script \n\nsplit_libraries_fastq.py. The files for -PNA and +PNA samples were then searched for chimeras with \n\nthe usearch61 method using the script identify_chimeric_seqs.py (Edgar, 2010) and the chimeric \n\nsequences were filtered out using the script filter_fasta.py. OTU tables with taxonomic affiliation \n\nwere then created using the script pick_open_reference_otus.py (Rideout et al., 2014) and the \n\nGreengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006). The OTU table that resulted from the -PNA sample \n\nwas not further studied. \n\nThe OTU table that resulted from the +PNA samples was then imported to (function read.csv; \n\npackage utils) and analyzed with R software (R Core Team, 2016). Alpha-diversity was explored \n\nusing several metrics included in the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2016): Shannon\u2019s diversity (H; \n\nfunction diversity), richness (function specnumber), Pielou\u2019s evenness (J; obtained by calculating \n\nH/log10 (richness)), Simpson\u2019s diversity (1-D; function diversity, index simpson), and inverse \n\nSimpson\u2019s diversity (1/D; function diversity, index invsimpson). Additionally, the sequencing \n\ncoverage of all samples was estimated using Chao\u2019s coverage estimator, which takes into account \n\nthe presence of singletons and doubletons (function coverage, package entropart; Marcon &amp; \n\nH\u00e9rault, 2015). Each alpha-diversity metric was then statistically analyzed using functions from the \n\npackage stats (R Core Team, 2016). First, the normality of the distribution of the values from all \n\nsamples was tested using the Shapiro normality test (function shapiro.test). When normality was \n\nobserved, (i) an ANOVA (function aov) was performed to assess statistical differences in this metric \n\namong the different plots; (ii) a t-Student test (function t.test) allowed determination of statistical \n\ndifference among the original plant tissues. If normality was not observed, (i) plot-related \n\ndifferences were assessed by performing a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (function kruskal.test), and \n\n(ii) tissue-related differences were tested with the Wilcoxon rank sum test (function wilcox.test). \n\n\n\n224 \n \n\nRarefaction curves were obtained using the function rarecurve (package vegan) and allowed \n\nassessment of the sequencing depth for each sample.  \n\nTransformation of the OTU table was performed with the functions sqrt and log10, both from the \n\npackage base (R Core Team, 2016). Resemblance matrices of these tables were built using the \n\nvegdist function from the package vegan with the method Bray-Curtis. A permutational multivariate \n\nanalysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) was performed using the function \n\nadonis from the package vegan to assess the effect of the factors plot and tissue on the OTU tables. \n\nFor instances where differences are observed among the different plots, the function \n\npairwise.adonis was used to determine the plot pairs that were effectively different (Annex I). \n\nOrdination methods were performed with the functions metaMDS and cmdscale, both from the \n\npackage vegan, to perform non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and principal coordinates \n\nanalysis (PCoA), respectively.  \n\nThe MetaCoMET platform was used to perform analyses on the occurrence of OTUs among tissues \n\nand sampling plots (Venn diagrams), based on the same OTU data that was analyzed with R (Wang \n\net al., 2016b). MetaCoMET was also used to further investigated OTUs that were shared by and \n\nexclusive to halophyte tissues or sampling plots, using as input: all samples, only AG samples, or \n\nonly BG samples. A Krona pie chart tool in this platform was used to visualize taxonomic hierarchical \n\ndata in all samples. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n225 \n \n\nResults and discussion \n\nSamples and Illumina MiSeq sequencing \n\nFifteen specimens of H. portulacoides were sampled and analyzed in order to determine the core \n\nendophytic microbiome of the halophyte and tissue-specific taxa. For the +PNA samples, a total of \n\n1761806 reads was obtained from Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Sequence filtering and processing \n\nsteps reduced the number of reads: 1714836 reads after PRINSEQ quality filtering, 1584871 reads \n\nafter merging paired-end sequences, 1550220 reads after demultiplexing, and 1538662 reads after \n\nfiltering out chimeric sequences (read number per sample is detailed in Table 5.2). Overall, 87.33 % \n\nof the initial reads were kept after the filtering steps. For the -PNA sample, a total of 16229 reads \n\nwas obtained after the sequence filtering and processing steps (data not shown). \n\n \n\n \n\nHost DNA contamination \n\nOne of the first steps in the study of endophytic communities involved total DNA extraction, which \n\ncomprised DNA from different sources: plant nuclei DNA, plant organelle DNA (from chloroplasts \n\nand mitochondria) and bacterial DNA. The proportion of bacterial:host DNA depends on the plant \n\nspecies and other factors (Jiao et al., 2006). Due to the universal nature of the primers regularly \n\nused for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, the most used gene in this type of studies, \n\namplification of the 16S rRNA gene from chloroplast DNA and 18S rRNA gene from mitochondrial \n\nDNA is very common as a result of sequence similarity. Consequently, the OTU tables that \n\nresearchers analyze after performing high-throughput sequencing are frequently populated with \n\naffiliations to organelle DNA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n226 \n \n\nTable 5.2 Number of reads after each sequence data processing step. \n\n Sequence data processing steps \n\nSample Raw reads \nQuality filtered \n\n(PRINSEQ) \nMerged paired-end \n\nsequences \nDemultiplexed \n\nsequences \nChimera filtered \n\nsequences \nFiltered host DNA \n\nsequences \n\n1 54629 53375 (97.7%) 49881 (91.31%) 49590 (90.78%) 49097 (89.87%) 28694 (52.53%) \n2 39988 38896 (97.27%) 36322 (90.83%) 35865 (89.69%) 35664 (89.19%) 8299 (20.75%) \n3 22506 21964 (97.59%) 20259 (90.02%) 20016 (88.94%) 19978 (88.77%) 228 (1.01%) \n4 13814 13373 (96.81%) 12251 (88.69%) 12040 (87.16%) 11980 (86.72%) 2863 (20.73%) \n5 28299 27595 (97.51%) 25220 (89.12%) 25085 (88.64%) 25036 (88.47%) 390 (1.38%) \n6 49816 48955 (98.27%) 46089 (92.52%) 45806 (91.95%) 44922 (90.18%) 27130 (54.46%) \n7 30788 30367 (98.63%) 28562 (92.77%) 28382 (92.19%) 28201 (91.6%) 16850 (54.73%) \n8 29987 29179 (97.31%) 26753 (89.22%) 26391 (88.01%) 26346 (87.86%) 1060 (3.53%) \n9 39493 37656 (95.35%) 34225 (86.66%) 33736 (85.42%) 33685 (85.29%) 479 (1.21%) \n\n10 46458 45464 (97.86%) 41702 (89.76%) 41109 (88.49%) 41054 (88.37%) 1219 (2.62%) \n11 39528 38704 (97.92%) 35769 (90.49%) 35376 (89.5%) 35318 (89.35%) 3905 (9.88%) \n12 34173 33144 (96.99%) 30192 (88.35%) 29601 (86.62%) 29451 (86.18%) 4716 (13.8%) \n13 48683 46935 (96.41%) 43238 (88.82%) 42647 (87.6%) 42571 (87.45%) 3811 (7.83%) \n14 44305 43482 (98.14%) 39709 (89.63%) 39377 (88.88%) 39294 (88.69%) 636 (1.44%) \n15 43877 42846 (97.65%) 39138 (89.2%) 39061 (89.02%) 38996 (88.88%) 175 (0.4%) \n16 44724 43636 (97.57%) 39862 (89.13%) 39638 (88.63%) 39570 (88.48%) 1347 (3.01%) \n17 80844 78655 (97.29%) 72833 (90.09%) 72481 (89.66%) 72364 (89.51%) 1028 (1.27%) \n18 80249 76833 (95.74%) 70941 (88.4%) 65641 (81.8%) 65546 (81.68%) 1233 (1.54%) \n19 65215 62593 (95.98%) 57099 (87.56%) 53363 (81.83%) 53237 (81.63%) 3318 (5.09%) \n20 81085 79264 (97.75%) 70355 (86.77%) 69645 (85.89%) 68201 (84.11%) 59450 (73.32%) \n21 87503 85083 (97.23%) 78956 (90.23%) 76482 (87.41%) 76371 (87.28%) 1153 (1.32%) \n22 99863 97713 (97.85%) 91122 (91.25%) 89524 (89.65%) 88401 (88.52%) 41676 (41.73%) \n23 92872 90434 (97.37%) 84727 (91.23%) 83050 (89.42%) 81901 (88.19%) 53385 (57.48%) \n24 101649 99639 (98.02%) 93813 (92.29%) 92491 (90.99%) 89420 (87.97%) 66309 (65.23%) \n25 73983 70583 (95.4%) 65026 (87.89%) 64743 (87.51%) 64570 (87.28%) 787 (1.06%) \n26 92632 90466 (97.66%) 84232 (90.93%) 79891 (86.25%) 79176 (85.47%) 35521 (38.35%) \n27 69061 67566 (97.84%) 61914 (89.65%) 61457 (88.99%) 61338 (88.82%) 448 (0.65%) \n28 47464 45321 (95.48%) 41725 (87.91%) 40401 (85.12%) 40262 (84.83%) 2453 (5.17%) \n29 89024 87567 (98.36%) 81830 (91.92%) 79723 (89.55%) 79388 (89.18%) 14060 (15.79%) \n30 89294 87548 (98.04%) 81126 (90.85%) 77608 (86.91%) 77324 (86.59%) 10561 (11.83%) \n\nTotal 1761806 1714836 (97.33%) 1584871 (89.96%) 1550220 (87.99%) 1538662 (87.33%) 393184 (22.32%) \n\n\n\n227 \n \n\nCommon methods used to avoid host DNA contamination in culture-independent studies of \n\nendophytic bacteria communities have the main goal of shifting the bacterial:host DNA ratio in a \n\nmanner that favors the amplification of bacterial template. These methods can intervene in \n\ndifferent stages of the common steps in this type of study:  \n\n(i) During DNA extraction, where specific protocols are used so that bacterial and host DNA are \n\nseparated (Jiao et al., 2006). Briefly, this method aims to differentially select bacterial cells for \n\nDNA extraction by physically separating the bacterial fraction from the host tissues by using a \n\nsucrose gradient and differential centrifugations. Prior to the centrifugations, an enzymatic \n\ndigestion is performed on the plant tissues, so as not to disrupt plant cells, which would enhance \n\nhost DNA contamination from chloroplasts and mitochondria. Jiao et al. (2006) showed that \n\ntheir method of enzyme treatment of plant tissues followed by differential centrifugation \n\neffectively increases the ratio of bacterial:host DNA. Nevertheless, this method requires a large \n\namount of plant tissue, which is not always possible to obtain, depending on the plant species \n\nor tissue at study. Additionally, enzymatic incubation steps prior to the differential \n\ncentrifugation may allow for bacterial proliferation, thus altering their initial structure (Wang et \n\nal., 2008). Furthermore, it follows reason that the centrifugation steps may obscure some \n\nbacterial diversity and alter the community structure by inadvertently discarding bacterial cells \n\nthat remained attached to plant tissue debris.  \n\n \n\n(ii) After DNA extraction and prior to PCR amplification, using restriction enzymes that are \n\nspecific for sequences in the organelle DNA (Shen &amp; Fulthorpe, 2015). The DNA extraction is \n\nperformed without distinction of host or bacterial DNA. The DNA extract is then subjected to \n\nenzymatic digestion (authors suggest 16 h at 37 \u00b0C) with enzymes that have restriction sites \n\ndownstream and upstream of universal primer binding sites in chloroplast DNA. As before, a \n\nlong enzymatic incubation step may allow for bacterial proliferation, affecting the original \n\ncommunity structure. The digested samples are then used for PCR amplification using universal \n\nprimers and the adequate sized bands are excised from the agarose gel after electrophoresis. \n\nThis requirement to extract the band from the gel may result in loss of information during \n\nsample processing. The method suggested by these authors only aims at reducing host DNA \n\ncontamination from chloroplast DNA. As such, mitochondrial DNA contamination is still \n\nobserved after sequencing. Finally, despite the methodology applied, the authors still removed \n\nreads belonging to chloroplasts from the sequencing data. \n\n\n\n228 \n \n\n(iii) During PCR amplification, using primers that perform a preferential amplification of bacterial \n\nDNA template (e.g., Chelius &amp; Triplett, 2001), or using PNA blockers that prevent amplification \n\nof host DNA template (Lundberg et al., 2013).  \n\nRegarding the first approach, a number of primers that are less likely to lead to organelle DNA \n\namplification have been described. By far, the most used is the 799f primer, which was firstly \n\ndescribed by Chelius &amp; Triplett (2001). This approach allows for a regular, non-differential DNA \n\nextraction, yielding host DNA and bacterial DNA in the total DNA pool. From this DNA pool, the \n\namplification of the 16S rRNA gene from chloroplast DNA is excluded due to sequence \n\nmismatches with the primer, and the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene from mitochondrial \n\nDNA results in an amplicon with a distinct molecular weight from that obtained from bacterial \n\n16S rRNA gene amplification. As a result, the bacterial amplicon can be excised from an agarose \n\ngel, and used for downstream applications such as sequencing (Chelius &amp; Triplett, 2001). \n\nNevertheless, this method presents some disadvantages. In addition to presenting sequence \n\nmismatches with the 16S rRNA gene sequence from chloroplast DNA, the primer 799f also \n\npresents mismatches with 16S rRNA gene sequences from bacterial groups, thereby introducing \n\na structure and diversity bias into the resulting PCR product (Chelius &amp; Triplett, 2001; Idris et al., \n\n2004). Additionally, this method requires the extraction of a band from an agarose gel, which, \n\nas mentioned before, may lead to loss of information during sample processing. Furthermore, \n\nthe method is not fully efficient, since authors have described having observed host DNA \n\nmatches from sequencing data obtained with 454-pyrosequencing (e.g. Bodenhausen et al., \n\n2013). Finally, the effectiveness of the 799f primer may result in minimal amplification of the \n\nbacterial sequences in the sample (Shen &amp; Fulthorpe, 2015; present work, data not shown). \n\nThe use of PNA blockers also allows for a DNA extraction protocol that yields host and bacterial \n\nDNA in the final DNA pool. The PNA clamps block the amplification of host organelle DNA thus \n\nallowing for a PCR product enriched in bacterial sequences, without introducing the bias of \n\nbacterial group exclusion or of subsequent technical steps that are necessary with the use of \n\ndifferential primers (Lundberg et al., 2013). The PNA blockers have been successfully used \n\nbefore in Illumina-based studies of endophytes (Carrell et al., 2016). Shen &amp; Fulhorpe (2015) \n\nalso used PNA blockers and compared results to those obtained from enzymatic digestion of \n\nchloroplast template DNA. After 454-pyrosequencing data analysis, the authors either obtained \n\nsimilar results regarding read number and percentage of host DNA reads, or obtained more \n\nreads with the PNA blockers.  \n\n\n\n229 \n \n\nIn the present work, the taxonomic attribution for the recovered OTUs from -PNA and +PNA \n\nsamples revealed several instances of OTU affiliation to the 16S rRNA sequence from chloroplast \n\nDNA and to the 18S rRNA sequence from mitochondrial DNA. For the +PNA samples, removing \n\nthese OTUs from the OTU table returned 393184 bacterial reads, which represents 22.32 % of the \n\ninitial read number (Table 5.2). This suggests that the utilization of PNA blockers was not sufficient \n\nto block amplification of all host DNA competing templates, which could be due to (i) an insufficient \n\nquantity of PNA blockers in the reaction, (ii) non optimal PCR conditions for the PNA clamping, or \n\n(iii) due to mismatches in the template sequence.  \n\n(i) Regarding the quantity of PNA blockers used in the reaction, the concentration suggested in \n\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions is 0.25 \u00b5M per reaction, which could be increased up to 1 \u00b5M \n\nto improve the clamping effect. After consulting with PNAbio representatives, it was decided to \n\noptimize the concentration of each blocker per reaction to 2 \u00b5M. Nevertheless, it may not have \n\nbeen sufficient to block all the templates from healthy specimens of the species H. \n\nportulacoides. The number of copies of target template from host DNA is unknown in this \n\nhalophyte, however, it is known that the number of copies of organelle genomes per cell can \n\nreach the tens of thousands in some plant species (Bendich, 1987). \n\n(ii) Regarding the PCR conditions used for PNA clamping, the temperature and time of PNA \n\nannealing were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. These conditions should present \n\nenough stringency to ensure proper annealing of the PNA blockers with their respective targets. \n\nOptimization was performed on the mPNA and pPNA solubilization step prior to PCR \n\namplification: the manufacturer\u2019s instructions suggest a 5 min incubation at 55 \u00b0C to solubilize \n\nthe PNA blockers before adding to the PCR reaction. We performed this step according to their \n\ninstructions and observed that the sequencing output still presented an unacceptably high \n\namount of host DNA contamination (data not shown). After contacting the manufacturer, and \n\nper their suggestion, this step was optimized by increasing the incubation time to 30 minutes. \n\n(iii) Regarding the possibility of mismatches between the PNA blockers and the target region of \n\nchloroplast and mitochondrial templates, it was demonstrated by Lundberg et al. (2013) that \n\nthose targets are conserved among higher plants. We have checked in silico the sequence match \n\nof pPNA blockers against chloroplast sequences of a distant plant species (Pinus pinaster) and a \n\nclosely related species (Spinacea oleracea) and observed that the match was 100 % in both cases \n\n(data not shown). As such, we assume that a plant species belonging to the same sub-family \n\nshould not present relevant mismatches in such a conserved region of the chloroplast DNA. We \n\n\n\n230 \n \n\ncould not perform the same test for mitochondrial DNA since the database is lacking for this \n\norganelle\u2019s genome. \n\n \n\nThe use of mPNA and pPNA blockers in the PCR reaction is described as allowing for a higher yield \n\nof bacterial DNA amplification when host DNA is present as a competing template for the reaction \n\n(Lundberg et al., 2013). This was tested in the present work by sequencing a randomly chosen DNA \n\nextract (sample 11) amplified in the absence and presence of PNA blockers. As a result, a \n\nremarkable 976-fold increase of bacterial reads was observed (Table 5.3). The addition of PNA \n\nblockers did not prevent the amplification of the entirety of host DNA templates, as discussed \n\nabove, however it allowed an immensely greater number of bacterial sequences to be analyzed in \n\nthe sample. \n\n \n\nTable 5.3 Comparison of number of reads resulting from PCR amplification in the absence and presence of \n\nPNA blockers.  \n\n Sample 11 -PNA Sample 11 +PNA \n\nTotal number of reads 16229 32533 \n\nDatabase match   \n\n   Bacterial 16S rRNA 4 (0.025 %) 3905 (12.0 %) \n\n   Mitochondrial 18S rRNA 3394 (20.91 %) 7980 (29.53 %) \n\n   Chloroplast 16S rRNA 12826 (79.03 %) 20266 (62.29 %) \n\n \n\nOther studies of endophytic bacterial diversity that apply Illumina-based sequencing technology \n\nusually do not mention which method, if any, was used to avoid host DNA contamination. \n\nAdditionally, when OTUs that show affiliation to host DNA are removed from the sequencing data, \n\nthe percentage of removed reads is often concealed. This lack of information in endophytic diversity \n\nreports represents a considerable obstacle in accurately comparing our results to those published \n\nto date. To the best of our knowledge, retaining roughly 22 % of the initial reads in this type of study \n\nis overall in agreement and/or superior to what is observed in the literature.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n231 \n \n\nSample analysis: alpha-diversity and rarefaction \n\nAll 30 samples were analyzed for their alpha-diversity metrics, namely Shannon\u2019s diversity, \n\nSimpson\u2019s dominance (complementary and inverse dominance), Pielou\u2019s evenness, Chao\u2019s \n\ncoverage estimators and richness determination (Table 5.4).  \n\n \n\nA wide range of values was observed throughout the 30 samples for Shannon\u2019s diversity, richness, \n\nPielou\u2019s evenness and Simpson\u2019s indices. For most plant specimens (12 of the 15) Shannon\u2019s \n\ndiversity (H) was higher for BG tissues than for the respective AG tissues. The same pattern was \n\nobserved for 13 of the 15 plant specimens in terms of richness. The highest H value (5.07) was \n\nobserved for a BG sample (sample 16), and the lowest H value (1.32) was observed for an AG sample \n\n(sample 1). These highest and lowest H values were coincident for the samples with extreme values \n\nfor Pielou\u2019s evenness (samples 16 and 1, respectively).  \n\n \n\nRarefaction curves allow an assessment of the sequencing depth for all samples (Figure 5.2a). A \n\nplateau was observed for most samples, indicating that a good sequencing depth was obtained \n\n(Figure 5.2b-f). Chao\u2019s coverage estimation values for all samples ranged from 89.76 % to 99.79 % \n\n(Table 5.4). These results from plateaued rarefaction curves and elevated coverage values indicate \n\nthat the communities for the different samples were well characterized, even in the presence of a \n\nprominent host DNA contamination in the sequencing output. Available literature on Illumina-\n\nbased studies of endophytic bacterial communities shows either lower or comparable values for \n\ncoverage estimation values (60 to 99.3 %; Table 5.5). Other alpha-diversity metrics were not \n\ncompared with other studies since they are inherently highly dependent on the methodology, plant \n\nspecies, and other factors. Coverage estimation values were chosen for comparison to have an \n\noverview of what is achievable with Illumina-based studies of endophytes using samples from \n\ndifferent tissues and plant species.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n232 \n \n\nTable 5.4 Alpha-diversity metrics results. \n\nSample \nAlpha-diversity metrics \n\nShannon (H) \nRichness \n(OTUs) \n\nPielou (J) Simpson (1-D) Simpson (1/D) \nChao's \n\ncoverage \n\n1 1.32 184 0.252 0.631 2.71 99.78 \n2 3.28 342 0.562 0.859 7.07 99.00 \n3 3.22 46 0.842 0.941 17.09 91.25 \n4 3.36 202 0.632 0.909 11.05 97.31 \n5 3.21 62 0.777 0.915 11.79 93.86 \n6 4.59 837 0.682 0.967 29.93 99.25 \n7 1.77 201 0.334 0.657 2.92 99.54 \n8 4.4 199 0.832 0.975 40.11 93.69 \n9 3.65 96 0.799 0.938 16.03 91.24 \n\n10 4.11 187 0.785 0.954 21.96 94.84 \n11 2.82 110 0.6 0.87 7.67 99.36 \n12 3.17 290 0.56 0.896 9.59 97.75 \n13 3.42 149 0.683 0.926 13.44 98.87 \n14 3.75 118 0.785 0.942 17.21 92.47 \n15 3.13 42 0.838 0.933 14.82 89.76 \n16 5.07 298 0.889 0.988 81.76 93.47 \n17 3.05 100 0.662 0.892 9.23 96.01 \n18 4.49 203 0.845 0.978 44.66 95.14 \n19 3.1 164 0.607 0.872 7.83 98.37 \n20 2.31 1122 0.33 0.622 2.64 99.76 \n21 4.06 133 0.83 0.97 33.38 96.79 \n22 3.66 775 0.551 0.928 13.86 99.52 \n23 2.51 512 0.402 0.798 4.94 99.78 \n24 3.35 537 0.533 0.919 12.37 99.79 \n25 3.96 113 0.837 0.962 26.44 95.43 \n26 3.59 634 0.557 0.921 12.68 99.61 \n27 4.12 113 0.871 0.972 36.07 90.2 \n28 4.45 323 0.771 0.966 29.78 95.8 \n29 2.24 229 0.412 0.67 3.03 99.43 \n30 3.57 356 0.608 0.937 15.84 98.83 \n\nMinimum 1.32 42 0.25 0.62 2.64 89.76 \nMedian 3.39 200 0.67 0.93 13.65 97.53 \n\nMaximum 5.07 1122 0.89 0.99 81.76 99.79 \n\n \n\nTable 5.5 Coverage estimation values reported for Illumina-based studies of endophytic bacterial \n\ncommunities.  \n\nPlant species Plant tissue and Coverage value (%) Reference \n\nOryza sativa \nSprout: 84 \nStem: 60 \nRoot: 83 \n\nWang et al.

Values are given for all 30 samples in the scatterplots (black: \n\nsamples 1 to 10, plot 1; grey: samples 11 to 20, plot 2; white: samples 21 to 30, plot 3; triangles: aboveground \n\ntissues; squares: belowground tissues); and for the three plots (PL1, PL2 and PL3) and two tissues (AG and \n\nBG) in the boxplots.   \n\n\n\n235 \n \n\nStatistical analyses were performed on the alpha-diversity metrics. First, normality was assessed \n\nfor each metric, and was only observed for Shannon\u2019s H (Shapiro-Wilk normality test: W = 0.97476, \n\np = 0.6756). Consequently, the tests performed on the values for Shannon\u2019s H followed normality \n\nassumptions (ANOVA and Student\u2019s t-Test), while tests performed on all other metrics did not \n\nrespect this assumption (Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon tests). We then tested if collecting the plants \n\nfrom different plots had an effect on the alpha-diversity metrics, and observed that there were no \n\nsignificant differences according to sampling plot.  \n\nFinally, we tested if the metrics varied according to the sampling tissue, and observed that there \n\nwere significant differences for Shannon\u2019s H (BG > AG; Student\u2019s t-Test: t = -2.7905, df = 27.481, p \n\n= 0.009454). Tissue-based differences were also observed in the culture-dependent approach for \n\nplants collected from the same site (Chapter 3; summary in Table 5.6). This pattern of differences \n\nin Shannon\u2019s diversity according to sampling tissue, where roots/BG tissues are more diverse than \n\nleaves/AG tissues, have also been reported in other Illumina-based studies of endophytic bacterial \n\ncommunities (Wang et al., 2016a; Xiao et al., 2017).  \n\n \n\nTable 5.6 Comparison of average values of alpha-diversity metrics from culture-dependent and culture-\n\nindependent methodologies. \n\nAlpha-diversity metric Culture-dependent (site C) Culture-independent \n\nShannon\u2019s diversity (H) \nAG: 2.08 \nBG: 2.18 \n\nAG: 3.04 \nBG: 3.81 \n\nPielou\u2019s evenness (J) \nAG: 0.84 \nBG: 0.90 \n\nAG: 0.65 \nBG: 0.66 \n\nAG, aboveground tissues; BG, belowground tissues. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of richness also revealed statistical significance according to sampling tissue (BG > AG; \n\nWilcoxon Rank Sum test: W = 22, p = 0.0001889). This has also been observed in Illumina-based \n\nstudies of endophytic bacterial communities of Aloe vera (Akinsanya et al., 2015) and soya bean, \n\nbut not for alfalfa (Xiao et al., 2017). Higher richness in BG tissues was not the pattern observed for \n\nthe number of OTUs when the culture-dependent approach was used (Table 3.2). The difference in \n\nthe methodologies used could justify this difference in results, since one of the major disadvantages \n\nof culture-dependent methods is that only a small fraction of the community is assessed (Amann \n\net al., 1995), which, in this case, is likely a result of culture media not providing the necessary \n\nnutrients for all the bacteria present in a community (Tanaka et al., 2014).  \n\n\n\n236 \n \n\nCommunity analysis: structure \n\nThe structure of the community was analyzed for all 30 samples. As observed above, the samples \n\ndiffer in read number (Table 5.2) and sequencing depth (Figure 5.2). When faced with such disparity \n\nin total read number per sample, some authors rely on sub-sampling of the original OTU table in \n\norder to obtain a representative OTU table with a minimal common read number for all samples. \n\nThis method, however, results in loss of information and has been highly criticized (McMurdie &amp; \n\nHolmes, 2014). In the case of the present work, applying this methodology would reduce sample \n\nsizes to roughly 200 reads per sample, which would exclude 98.47 % of the obtained bacterial reads. \n\nSince our data is intrinsically prone to loss of information due to host DNA contamination, this \n\nmethodology will not be applied in the present work. As an alternative, the effect that the disparity \n\nin sample size presents can be reduced by using an adequate distance measure to build a \n\nresemblance matrix to further study the relationships among the samples (McMurdie &amp; Holmes, \n\n2013).  \n\n \n\nThe original OTU table was subjected to data transformations in order to understand the effect of \n\nOTU abundance: (i) a square root transformation (srOTU) to down-weight the high-abundance \n\nOTUs; (ii) a logarithmic transformation (logOTU, with log10) to enhance the importance given to \n\nlow-abundance OTUs, and to lower the weight of high-abundance OTUs. The boxplots depicted in \n\nFigure 5.4 show the distribution of total number of reads per OTU for the original OTU table, and \n\nfor the transformed logOTU and srOTU tables.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 Boxplot of total number of reads per OTU for the original and transformed OTU tables. srOTU, \n\nsquare root transformed OTU table; logOTU, logarithm (log10) transformed OTU table. \n\n \n\n\n\n237 \n \n\nThe original OTUs and transformed OTUs tables were then used to create resemblance matrices \n\nusing the Bray-Curtis distance measure. Statistical analyses of these matrices revealed that the \n\ntissue of origin (AG or BG) significantly affected the structure of the community (Adonis: p = 0.001 \n\nfor all OTU tables). However, the percentage of variation that this factor represented was relatively \n\nlow (Adonis: R2 = 8.69 %, 13.02 % and 11.97 % for the original, logOTU and srOTU tables, \n\nrespectively). These percentage values indicate that other variables are contributing for the \n\nmajority of the variability observed among the samples (87 to 91 %).  \n\n \n\nOther factors that could contribute to the observed variability were then analyzed: plant, \n\nmonospecific stand and plot of origin. The community structure was only significantly affected by \n\nplot of origin, and only when logarithmic or square root transformation was applied to the OTU \n\ntables (Adonis: p = 0.011 and 0.022 for logOTU and srOTU, respectively). Nevertheless, the \n\ncontribution of this factor was also low (Adonis: R2 = 9.72 % and 9.36 %, respectively) and a high \n\npercentage of variability was still left unaccounted for (> 77 %). In both cases, the statistically \n\ndifferent plots were Plot 2 and Plot 3 (Pairwise Adonis: p = 0.012 and 0.036 for logOTU and srOTU, \n\nrespectively). No interaction of factors revealed statistical significance. These results indicate that \n\nover 77 % of the variability observed is not accounted for by the analyzed factors. This residual \n\nvariability may be due to: \n\n(i) Physical or chemical factors that were not analyzed in the present work. As discussed before \n\n(Chapter 3), factors such as soil water content, organic matter content, fine particle content, \n\nredox potential, pH, and conductivity should be assessed in order to better understand the \n\neffects of the environment on the community. However, since the fifteen plant samples at study \n\nwere collected from one site, it is not expected that these factors should vary enough to impose \n\nsignificant changes. Furthermore, changes in such factors should be reflected by the \n\n\u2018monospecific stand\u2019 factor that was analyzed and found to not be significant in explaining the \n\nobserved variability. \n\n(ii) Methodology-induced variability throughout sample handling steps. To assess if DNA \n\nextraction of the different samples, PCR amplification, or amplicon sequencing were the source \n\nof the observed variability, replication should be performed at all the different steps of the \n\nmethodology.  \n\n\n\n238 \n \n\n(iii) Bias in OTU formation introduced by read length. The raw reads were quality-filtered \n\naccording to several parameters, such as read length, and reads with less that 150 bp were \n\ndiscarded. It is possible that reads that should be grouped into the same taxonomic unit are \n\nbeing separated due to a bias introduced by difference in read length. This would introduce \n\nadditional diversity that does not correspond to the reality of the endophytic bacterial \n\ncommunity. This possible bias could influence the low-abundance OTUs in the sense that not \n\nmany of the OTUs would present a length that is compatible with OTU formation using the \n\nparameters that were used. In the case that this bias exists, it is wiser to look at the most \n\nabundant OTUs, even if it counters the aim of doing such an in-depth methodology like Illumina-\n\nbased sequencing.  \n\n(iv) Heterogeneity in the community may be a reflection of transitory associations due to \n\nadaptation of the ever-changing surrounding biotic and abiotic factors (reviewed in \n\nVandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nOrdination methods were then performed to assess the existence of patterns according to the \n\nfactors that revealed a significant effect on the community structure: plot and tissue of origin. The \n\nordination methods chosen were the rank-based non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS; \n\nFigure 5.5) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA; Figure 5.6), and they were performed on the \n\noriginal and transformed OTU tables. \n\nThe NMDS representations revealed a sizeable structural variation among the 30 samples, which \n\ndoes not appear to be substantially influenced by the OTU table used as input. The NMDS \n\nrepresentations revealed a clear pattern that separated the samples according to sampling tissue \n\nacross the first axis (MDS1), which is in accordance with the statistical analysis performed above. A \n\nclear pattern is not observed for plot of origin: Plot 2 and Plot 3 appear to be more distinguishable \n\nfrom each other, but both have a coincident distribution with samples from Plot 1. \n\nThe stress values associated to each representation reflect the distortion applied to the \n\nrelationships among samples, which is necessary to display the distances in a bi-dimensional \n\nenvironment. The stress values obtained are acceptable (&lt;0.2), and are the lowest when the data \n\nis transformed by applying square root to the OTU abundance values, and the highest for non-\n\ntransformed OTU values.  \n\n\n\n239 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the endophytic community according to plot and \n\ntissue of origin. PL1, sampling plot 1; PL2, sampling plot 2; PL3, sampling plot 3; AG, aboveground; BG, \n\nbelowground.  \n\n\n\n240 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the endophytic community according to plot and tissue of \n\norigin. PL1, sampling plot 1; PL2, sampling plot 2; PL3, sampling plot 3; AG, aboveground; BG, belowground. \n\n \n\nThe PCoA representation is in accordance with the NMDS representation for the transformed data \n\n(logOTU and srOTU). It is noteworthy that, for the transformed data, the separation of the samples \n\nacross the most explicative axis (PCoA1) reflects the factor tissue of origin, and accounts for 14.64 \n\nto 15.28 % of the variability observed among the samples in the bi-dimensional reduced \n\nenvironment. Again, this separation is in accordance with what was observed in the statistical \n\nanalyses.  \n\n\n\n241 \n \n\nThe PCoA representation for the original OTUs, however, tells a different story. The dispersion of \n\nthe samples in the graphic representation is not as marked, especially across the second axis \n\n(PCoA2). This is not observed in the NMDS method because, since it is a non-metric approach, it \n\nuses rank-based distances, whilst the PCoA uses absolute distances. These results suggest that the \n\nhigh-abundance OTUs (which are down-weighted in the transformed OTU tables) are highly \n\ninfluential in determining the distances among the 30 samples. Additionally, no marked differences \n\nare observed for the different data transformations (logOTU vs srOTU), suggesting that the rare \n\nOTUs up-weighted in the log10 transformation do not exert relevant influence on the relationships \n\namong the samples.  \n\n \n\nThe most abundant OTUs influence the distribution of the samples in reduced space \n\nrepresentations. This was observed when comparing (i) PCoA and NMDS representations for the \n\nnon-transformed OTUs, and (ii) PCoA representations for the original and transformed OTU tables. \n\nThere is statistical congruence showing that samples originated from AG tissues differ from those \n\nfrom BG tissues. Although it was not verified in all occurrences, the plot of origin should also be \n\ntaken into account as a factor of OTU variability in the community.  \n\n \n\nVenn diagrams were then obtained to understand the proportion and abundance of OTUs that were \n\nexclusive and shared among tissues and plots (Figure 5.7). This is a different approach from the \n\nreduced space representations (NMDS and PCoA) since the Venn diagram does not take into \n\naccount the distances among samples based on OTU abundance. The Venn diagrams here \n\npresented are useful to understand the OTU composition of the different levels of the factors tissue \n\nand plot. Venn diagrams were built including all OTUs (Figure 5.7a-b) and excluding very rare OTUs \n\n(less than 3 reads; Figure 5.7c-d) to understand their effect among the sampling tissues and plots. \n\nThe Venn diagrams built using all the OTUs found in the community (3593) revealed that the \n\nmajority of the OTUs were found exclusively in BG tissues. This heterogeneity of OTU occurrence is \n\nin accordance with what was observed in the statistical analysis and also in the reduced space \n\nrepresentations, where the sampling tissue was a significant factor in accounting for the differences \n\namong samples. \n\n\n\n242 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 Venn diagrams built using OTUs from the endophytic bacterial community. OTUs are grouped \n\naccording to occurrence in sampling tissues (a, c) and plots (b, d). Diagrams a and b were built using all OTUs \n\nfrom the community, while diagrams c and d were built using only the OTUs with more than 2 reads. The \n\ncorresponding read numbers and their percentages are also presented. AG, aboveground; BG, belowground.  \n\n \n\nThe Venn diagram for sampling tissue showed that the number of reads exclusive in BG tissues did \n\nnot reflect the OTU richness. In fact, the majority of bacterial reads were observed in the OTUs that \n\nwere shared between AG and BG tissues. This suggests that the majority of the endophytic bacteria \n\noccurrences are shared among the tissues of the halophyte. As explored in Chapter 3, it is reported \n\nin the literature that endophytic bacteria colonize the plant through openings in the root system, \n\nand that these bacteria then colonize the inner tissues of the plant, reaching AG tissues as well \n\n(reviewed in Lodewyckx et al., 2002). The 516 AG tissue-exclusive OTUs may result from alternative \n\nentry points into the halophyte, as was also discussed in Chapter 3. \n\n\n\n243 \n \n\nIn the Venn diagram for OTU occurrence grouped according to sampling plot (Figure 5.7b), it can \n\nbe observed that the majority of the OTUs (2083) are unique to one of the sampling plots. These \n\nplot-exclusive OTUs are, however, present in low read numbers and account for 10.16 % of the total \n\nnumber of reads. As was the case for the Venn diagram according to tissue (Figure 5.7a), the \n\nmajority of the reads are shared among all the plots (80.05 %).  \n\n \n\nThe results suggest that low-abundance OTUs are enhancing the differences among sampling plots \n\nor tissues when the data are interpreted in terms of OTUs. This is confirmed by the Venn diagrams \n\nbuilt excluding very rare OTUs (less than 3 reads; Figure 5.7c-d), where the numbers of OTUs and \n\nreads in exclusive groups (either sampling plots or tissues) decrease. This decrease is more marked \n\nin the case of plot-exclusive OTUs, where over 60 % of plot-exclusive OTUs for plots 2 and 3 are \n\nremoved. These very rare OTUs may be responsible for the observed significant differences \n\nobtained in the statistical analysis that revealed the sampling plot as a significant factor for the OTU \n\ncomposition of the community.  \n\nOur earlier statement that the variability observed may be due to the methodology used is also \n\nsupported: since Illumina sequencing allows for an extensive and in-depth analysis of each sample, \n\nmany rare OTUs will be found, and those are likely to differ among different samples, or even \n\namong different sequencing runs.   \n\n\n\n244 \n \n\nCommunity analysis: overall composition  \n\nThe taxonomic attribution of the endophytic bacterial community of H. portulacoides was assessed \n\nto understand the most relevant bacterial groups in the whole community and in the different \n\nsampling tissues. Sampling plot was also considered, but was less focused on.  \n\nFigure 5.8 depicts the taxa in the total community at the levels phylum, class, order and family. \n\nOverall, 37 phyla, 85 classes, 115 orders, 182 families and 232 genera were observed (detailed lists \n\nare presented in Annex II).  \n\nThe dominant phylum observed in the endophytic bacterial community was Proteobacteria (62.5 \n\n% of OTUs; 87 % of reads). Other main phyla included Bacteroidetes (10.7 % of OTUs; 6 % of reads) \n\nand Planctomycetes (8.8% of OTUs; 2 % of reads). Firmicutes (2.4 % of OTUs; 2 % of reads) and \n\nActinobacteria (5.2 % of OTUs; 1 % of reads) were also present. These results are in accordance \n\nwith what was observed in the culturable fraction of the endophytic bacteria of this halophyte \n\n(Chapter 3), with the exception that the phylum Planctomycetes was not observed in the culture-\n\nbased method.  \n\nThe phyla of endophytic and other plant-associated bacteria observed in different halophyte \n\nspecies are listed in Table 5.7. All phyla observed in the other studies stated in Table 5.7 were also \n\ndetected in the present work. The phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and \n\nBacteroidetes appear to be, overall, very frequent in the plant-associated bacterial communities \n\namong the different halophyte plant species, even in those not closely related to H. portulacoides. \n\nThese four phyla have also been described in association with other plants (Bulgarelli et al., 2013). \n\nPrevious reports of bacteria associated with H. portulacoides also reported the presence of \n\nProteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Oliveira et al., 2014a; Oliveira et al., 2014b).  \n\nThe phylum Planctomycetes occurs in a considerable percentage in our Illumina-based analysis \n\n(approximately 9 %), however its detection has not been very frequent among the communities of \n\nhalophytes. It was detected in the rhizosphere of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum by 454-\n\npyrosequencing (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2016) and in the sediment colonized by Spartina alterniflora in \n\nthe analysis of a clone library (Shuang et al., 2009). Our report is, to the best of our knowledge, the \n\nfirst of Planctomycetes as an endophyte of halophytes.

The specific nutritional requirements of this group of \n\nbacteria may justify their presence in the endosphere of a halophyte. According to Musat et al. \n\n(2006), Planctomycetes are common in marine sediments that are subjected to tides, which is an \n\nenvironment comparable to that of a salt marsh. The ecological role of this phylum is hypothesized \n\nto be related to providing competition with undesired microorganisms, avoiding dissecation, \n\nparticipating in the marine nitrogen cycle by anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and potentially \n\nproducing relevant metabolites (Lage et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nThe main classes observed in the endophytic community included Alphaproteobacteria (28.8 % of \n\nOTUs; 33 % of reads), Gammaproteobacteria (28.3 % of OTUs, 53 % of reads), Planctomycetia (7.2 \n\n% of OTUs, 2 % of reads), Flavobacteriia (5.3 % of OTUs, 3 % of reads), Deltaproteobacteria (3.7 % \n\nof OTUs, 1 % of reads) and Cytophagia (3.1 % of OTUs; 3 % of reads). Both Alpha- and \n\nGammaproteobacteria were also found dominant classes when using the culture-based \n\nmethodology applied in this report (Chapter 3). \n\nThe main families in number of OTUs in the bacterial endophytic community (comprising \n\napproximately 55 % of the OTUs) included Rhodobacteraceae (206 OTUs), Enterobacteriaceae \n\n(205), Oceanospirillaceae (192), Pirellulaceae (157), Flavobacteriaceae (155), Alteromonadaceae \n\n(147), Erythrobacteraceae (124), Hyphomicrobiaceae (114), Sphingomonadaceae (100), \n\nPlanctomycetaceae (94), Flammeovirgaceae (74), Pseudomonadaceae (66), Rhizobiaceae (56), \n\nVerrucomicrobiaceae (51), Rhodospirillaceae (51), Halomonadaceae (48), Piscirickettsiaceae (47), \n\nand Kiloniellaceae (45). The families with higher number of reads (over 10000) were: \n\nOceanospirillaceae (80518 reads), Enterobacteriaceae (47558), Kiloniellaceae (27656), \n\nErythrobacteraceae (19438), Pseudomonadaceae (18298), Hyphomicrobiaceae (16712), \n\nAlteromonadaceae (14134), Piscirickettsiaceae (11587), Saccharospirillaceae (11358), \n\nFlavobacteriaceae (11164) and Sphingomonadaceae (10205). Several of the families found in the \n\npresent work were also detected in diversity assays in closely related plants (same family; Table \n\n\n\n248 \n \n\n5.8). The families Enterobacteriaceae and Halomonadaceae were frequently found in those studies: \n\n4 out of 5 analyzed studies. \n\n \n\nTable 5.8 Families of plant-associated bacteria observed in closely related halophyte species.

Curiously, the family Dietziaceae, which was present in the culturable \n\nfraction with 19 isolates, was not detected with the Illumina-based approach.  \n\nIsolates affiliated to the families Erythrobacteraceae, Aerococcaceae, Microbacteriaceae, \n\nHalomonadaceae and Vibrionaceae tested positive for several enzymatic assays and plant growth \n\npromotion traits (PGP, Chapter 3). In the Illumina-based approach, these families were found in \n\nmore or less abundant amounts: 19438 reads (124 OTUs) for Erythrobacteraceae, 3399 reads (17 \n\n\n\n249 \n \n\nOTUs) for Aerococcaceae, 60 reads (6 OTUs) for Microbacteriaceae, 6947 reads (48 OTUs) for \n\nHalomonadaceae and 1118 reads (21 OTUs) for Vibrionaceae.  \n\n \n\nCommunity analysis: core composition \n\nThe sampling tissue was determined to be a significant factor in the relationships between the \n\nsamples of the endophytic community of H. portulacoides, and those differences were reflected in \n\nthe NMDS and PCoA analyses. The sampling plot was also found to play a role in those relationships \n\nand, consequently, these two factors are now being analyzed for their influence in the taxonomic \n\ncomposition of the endophytic community from H. portulacoides.  \n\nFigure 5.9 shows the distribution of the twenty most read-abundant families across the different \n\ncombinations of sampling plots and tissues. It is clear that there are differences in composition of \n\nthe most dominant families between sampling tissues and sampling plots. A notable difference is \n\nobserved for the combination of both tissues for Plot 2, where a clear dominance of [Tissierellaceae] \n\nand Enterobacteriaceae families are observed for AG and BG tissues, respectively.  \n\nUpon observation of the original data, it was clear that most of the reads from this family were \n\nobserved in this plot in one single sample (99.5 % for [Tissierellaceae] in sample 11, and 91.4 % for \n\nEnterobacteriaceae in sample 20). This result contributes to explain why the sampling plot was \n\ndetermined to be a significant factor for the differences observed among the samples, since such a \n\nmarked dominance is observed for these particular sets of OTUs.  \n\n \n\nIn the culturable approach, the genera Hoeflea, Labrenzia and Microbacterium were exclusively \n\nfound in BG tissues. With the Illumina-based approach, OTUs attributed to the family \n\nPhyllobacteriaceae (to which the genus Hoeflea is assigned) were found to either be exclusive to \n\nBG tissues (16 OTUs, 179 reads) or shared between both tissues (9 OTUs, 1472 reads). In the case \n\nof the family Hyphomicrobiaceae (to which the genus Labrenzia belongs), tissue-exclusivity was not \n\nobserved, however less OTUs were found to be exclusive to AG tissues (3 OTUs, 19 reads), and more \n\nexclusive to BG tissues (100 OTUs, 2277 reads) and shared between both tissues (11 OTUs, 14416 \n\nreads). OTUs attributed to the family Microbacteriaceae (to which the genus Microbacterium \n\nbelongs) were observed exclusive to AG tissues (2 OTUs, 16 reads), exclusive to BG tissues (1 OTU, \n\n2 reads), and shared between both tissues (3 OTUs, 42 reads).  \n\n\n\n250 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 Read abundance for the twenty top families according to sampling tissue and plot. AG, aboveground tissues; BG, belowground tissues; numbers refer to the \n\nsampling plot. \n\n \n\n\n\n251 \n \n\nWith the Illumina-based sequencing, several families were exclusively associated to one of the \n\nsampling tissues (15 to AG and 49 to BG tissues). For most of these occurrences, the read number \n\nwas very low, which can justify their exclusiveness.  \n\nThe tissue-exclusive OTUs with at least 10 reads were, for AG tissues: Actinomycetaceae (1 OTU, 14 \n\nreads), Carnobacteriaceae (1 OTU, 14 reads), Leptotrichiaceae (1 OTU, 32 reads), \n\nPorphyromonadaceae (3 OTUs, 139 reads), Prevotellaceae (3 OTUs, 62 reads), Sanguibacteraceae \n\n(1 OTU, 16 reads) and Veillonellaceae (4 OTUs, 117 reads).  \n\nThe BG-exclusive families were: [Balneolaceae] (3 OTUs, 19 reads), [Cerasicoccaceae] (5 OTUs, 162 \n\nreads), [Chthoniobacteraceae] (10 OTUs, 103 reads), Acetobacteraceae (2 OTUs, 31 reads), \n\nAlcanivoracaceae (3 OTUs, 21 reads), Arctic95B-10 (3 OTUs, 20 reads), Desulfovibrionaceae (4 OTUs, \n\n33 reads), Francisellaceae (1 OTU, 27 reads), Gemmataceae (3 OTUs, 21 reads), Holosporaceae (1 \n\nOTU, 277 reads), JdFBGBact (1 OTU, 11 reads), koll13 (3 OTUs, 56 reads), Kordiimonadaceae (2 \n\nOTUs, 20 reads), Leptospiraceae (5 OTUs, 28 reads), Methylophilaceae (3 OTUs, 197 reads), \n\nNitrospiraceae (1 OTU, 10 reads), Oleiphilaceae (2 OTUs, 12 reads), OM60 (11 OTUs, 396 reads), \n\nOpitutaceae (9 OTUs, 58 reads), Parachlamydiaceae (2 OTUs, 38 OTUs), Phycisphaeraceae (9 OTUs, \n\n67 reads), Polyangiaceae (1 OTU, 32 reads), Pseudonocardiaceae (8 OTUs, 259 reads), RB40 (6 \n\nOTUs, 42 reads), Rhodobiaceae (2 OTUs, 17 reads), Sinobacteraceae (5 OTUs, 52 reads), SJA-101 (2 \n\nOTUs, 29 reads) and Trueperaceae (4 OTUs, 13 reads). \n\n \n\nTo achieve our goal of determining the core endophytome of H. portulacoides, we analyzed the AG \n\nand BG tissues separately in terms of taxonomic composition, and looked exclusively at the OTUs \n\nthat are shared among all sampled plots, i.e., the core for each tissue of the halophyte. Our \n\ndefinition of core microbiome in the present work is the membership core, where the taxa shared \n\namong all the microbiomes of each plot are considered the core (Shade &amp; Handelsman, 2011). Since \n\nfifteen samples of each tissue were sampled and are under analysis, the core endophytome further \n\ndiscussed should be representative of the population at study (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015).  \n\nRemoving the plot-specific OTUs still conserved approximately 75 % of the total reads obtained in \n\nthe output. This indicates that the obtained core is substantial across the complex endophytic \n\ncommunity. The core endophytome for each sampling tissue will be discussed below, alongside the \n\npossible ecological functions associated to those core taxa.  \n\n\n\n252 \n \n\nAlthough function can differ according to bacterial species or even strain (Glick, 2015), it is relevant \n\nto address the possible ecological functions, since the core endophytome is important for the plant \n\nholobiont (reviewed in Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). \n\nIn the AG tissues, the core bacterial endophytome is composed of 104 OTUs, and the core BG \n\nbacterial endophytome is composed of 299 OTUs. Figure 5.10 shows the distribution of the most \n\nread-abundant families for the core of each sampling tissue.  \n\n \n\nThe core endophytome of the AG tissues is overwhelmingly dominated by OTUs affiliated to the \n\nfamily Oceanospirillaceae (3 Marinomonas OTUs; 72086 reads) that comprises 72 % of the reads in \n\nthe core endophytome for AG tissues. The low number of OTUs and large number of reads \n\nassociated to the family Oceanospirillaceae suggest that well-adapted endophytes are dominant in \n\nthe AG tissues of H. portulacoides. Regarding its possible ecological role in the endosphere, a \n\nmetagenomics approach linked the family Oceanospirillaceae (genus Marinomonas) to functions \n\nsuch as the production of B12 vitamin, which is used in metabolism of plants and bacteria (such as \n\nPlanctomycetes, as discussed above), pyruvate synthesis, response to environmental stress and \n\ndetoxification, participation in nitrogen (e.g., ammonium assimilation and glutamine production), \n\nsulfur, phosphorus and carbohydrate metabolism, and iron uptake (Delmont et al., 2015).  \n\nThe genus Marinomonas contains 24 species described thus far, presents worldwide distribution in \n\nmarine environments, and has been isolated from the endosphere of the halophyte Spartina \n\nmaritima (Lucena et al., 2016). Most species from this genus require salt for growth, and some can \n\ngrow in the presence of 15 % salinity (Lucena et al., 2016). Traits observed in the endophytic \n\ncommunity of Spartina maritima included enzymatic activities (protease, amilase, cellulase and \n\nlipase) and PGP traits (ACC deaminase activity, IAA and siderophore production, nitrogen fixation \n\nand phosphate solubilization; Mesa et al., 2015).  \n\nIn the culturable fraction from the present work (Chapter 3), isolates belonging to the genus \n\nMarinomonas presented 2 to 7 enzymatic activities (cellulolytic and xylanolytic present in all), and \n\nPGP traits such as IAA production, ACC deaminase activity and presence of the nifH gene. \n\n \n\n\n\n253 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 Read abundance for the top core families for each tissue. AG, aboveground tissues; BG, belowground tissues. \n\n \n\n\n\n254 \n \n\nOther families observed in the AG core endophytome included Flammeovirgaceae (2 unassigned \n\nOTUs; 5652 reads), Enterobacteriaceae (2 OTUs assigned to Erwinia and Klebsiella; 3387 reads), \n\nFlavobacteriaceae (6 OTUs attributed to Leeuwenhoekiella, Mesonia and Salegentibacter; 3283 \n\nreads), Erythrobacteraceae (11 OTUs attributed to Citromicrobium, Lutibacterium and unassigned \n\ngenera; 1750 reads), Halomonadaceae (7 OTUs assigned to Kushneria and Halomonas; 1594 reads), \n\nKiloniellaceae (1 Thalassospira OTU; 1428 reads), Salinisphaeraceae (4 Salinisphaera OTUs; 1379 \n\nreads), Sphingomonadaceae (7 OTUs attributed to Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas and \n\nunassigned genera; 1336 reads) and Rhodobacteraceae (8 OTUs attributed to Paracoccus, \n\nSulfitobacter and unassigned genera; 1332 reads), which overall comprise 21 % of the OTUs from \n\nthe AG core endophytome. \n\nIsolates obtained from these families in the culturable approach (attributed to the genera \n\nLeeuwenhoekiella, Mesonia, Citromicrobium, Kushneria, Halomonas, Thalassospira, \n\nNovosphingobium, Paracoccus and Sulfitobacter) presented up to 6 (one Halomonadaceae isolate) \n\nenzymatic activities and PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (only Halomonadaceae), IAA \n\nproduction (in all families), siderophore production (Halomonadaceae, Erythrobacteraceae, \n\nRhodobacteraceae and Kiloniellaceae), presence of nifH gene (Erythrobacteraceae, \n\nHalomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae) and ACC deaminase activity (Halomonadaceae, \n\nErythrobacteraceae, Kiloniellaceae and Rhodobacteraceae).  \n\n \n\nThe core endophytome from the BG tissues was mainly populated by Enterobacteriaceae (3 OTUs, \n\nattributed to Citrobacter, Erwinia, and an unassigned genus; 35965 reads) and Kiloniellaceae (4 \n\nOTUs, 3 attributed to Thalassospira and one unassigned genus; 25657 reads), comprising 32 % of \n\nthe reads in the BG core endophytome.  \n\nGenera belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae have been widely found in plant-associated \n\nenvironments, including the endosphere (Hardoim et al., 2015). In the isolate collection this family \n\nwas represented only by Rahnella spp. isolates, which presented proteolytic, cellulolytic and \n\nxylanolytic activities, and were able to solubilize phosphate, produce siderophores and IAA in high \n\namounts (105.9 \u00b5g mL-1), and presented ACC deaminase activity. The family Enterobacteriaceae \n\ncontains many genera capable of promoting the growth of plants and whose strains present \n\nenzymatic activities and traits that are of interest for direct and indirect promotion of plant growth. \n\nLiterature shows that the most observed traits are siderophore production, IAA production, and \n\n\n\n255 \n \n\nphosphate solubilization. More details are now discussed for some genera of interest, namely \n\nCitrobacter, Pantoea, Enterobacter and Erwinia.  \n\nCitrobacter, one of the genera to which OTUs were assigned in the Illumina-based sequencing, has \n\nbeen associated with production of ammonium and IAA (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016), ACC deaminase \n\nactivity, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). In these \n\nstudies, authors also observed that the Citrobacter spp. isolates were able to promote growth of \n\ndifferent plant species: tomato (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016) and wheat (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). \n\nPantoea was firstly detected as a plant pathogen, but has recently been found to also have a plant \n\npromotion effect, especially with a newly described species, Pantoea alhagi (Chen et al., 2017). \n\nPlant growth promotion has been observed in wheat, Arabidopsis thaliana (Chen et al., 2017) and \n\ntomato (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016). Detected traits included the production of ammonium and IAA, \n\nphosphate solubilization (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016), nitrate reduction, siderophore production, \n\nexopolysaccharides (EPS), and cellulolytic and proteolytic activities.  \n\nEnterobacter, alongside Pantoea, comprise members that present a range of interactions with \n\nplants from pathogenicity to mutualism (Hardoim et al., 2015). Member of the genus Enterobacter \n\nhave been thoroughly explored for their abilities as a plant growth promoters, and have been found \n\nto promote growth of different plant species, such as tomato (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016), wheat \n\n(Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017) and coconut seedlings (Gupta et al., 2014). Several traits have been \n\nassociated with the genus Enterobacter, such as production of ammonium and IAA (in some cases \n\nwith high levels; Ribeiro &amp; Cardoso, 2012), phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, siderophore \n\nproduction (Thomas &amp; Upreti, 2016; Ribeiro &amp; Cardoso, 2012), ACC deaminase activity, ammonium \n\nand EPS production, and cellulolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic activities (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). \n\nAn analysis of the genomes of Enterobacter strains revealed additional genes of interest for the \n\napplication of plant growth promotion, including genes that allow an enhancement of nutrient \n\navailability, decrease in pathogenic fungi, resistance to oxidative stress, quorum sensing, \n\nbreakdown of aromatic and toxic compounds and other abiotic stressers. Other genes present in \n\nthe genomes included those related to ACC deaminase activity, IAA and siderophore production, \n\nphosphate solubilization, H2S production, peroxidases, chitinases and catalases (Gupta et al., 2014). \n\nIsolates from maize belonging to the genera Enterobacter and Pantoea have been explored for their \n\npotential as biofertilizers in tropical soils due to their ability to solubilize phosphate (de Abreu et \n\nal., 2017). \n\n\n\n256 \n \n\nFinally, the genus Erwinia, which was also assigned to our endophytic OTUs in the Illumina-based \n\nsequencing, has been mainly isolated from plant tissues where it has shown both pathogenic and \n\nnon-pathogenic behavior, depending on the bacterial species. Genome-based evidence showed \n\nthat these differences among species (namely the phytopathogenic E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae \n\nand the epiphytic E. tasmaniensis and E. billingiae) are due to recombination events. Additionally, \n\nthe same study suggested that factors such as EPS production, expression of proteases and \n\nsiderophores, and the metabolism of certain carbohydrates contribute to the different observed \n\nbehaviors (Kube et al., 2010). The non-pathogenic species E. billingiae has also been observed to \n\npresent antagonistic behavior in the present of phytopathogenic fungi in Pinus radiata, where it is \n\nsuggested that this Erwinia species can be used as a biocontrol agent (Mesanza et al., 2016). \n\nRecently, an endophytic isolate from potato has exhibited PGP traits such as phosphate \n\nsolubilization and siderophore production. In vivo tests on potato seedlings confirmed the non-\n\npathogenic behavior of this Erwinia endophytica isolate (Ram\u00edrez-Bahena et al., 2016). The \n\nspecimens of H. portulacoides that were analyzed in the present work did not present symptoms \n\nof disease, which may suggest that the Erwinia spp. obtained in the Illumina-based sequencing \n\nbelong to non-pathogenic species (Ram\u00edrez-Bahena et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\nFor the family Kiloniellaceae, the traits observed in the endophytic collection have been discussed \n\nabove for the genus Thalassospira in the AG core endophytome. In addition to our work, this genus \n\nhas not been characterized regarding its PGP abilities or enzymatic activities. It has, however, been \n\nhighly associated with the capacity to degrade hydrocarbons (e.g., Zhao et al, 2010), which can be \n\na useful trait in the setting of a salt marsh subjected to influence of anthropogenic activities. \n\n \n\nOther relevant families in the BG core endophytome included Erythrobacteraceae (28 OTUs, \n\nattributed to Citromicrobium, Lutibacterium, Erythrobacter and unassigned genera; 16314 reads), \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae (19 OTUs, attributed to Devosia and unassigned genera; 13959 reads), \n\nPseudomonadaceae (3 OTUs, attributed to Pseudomonas and an unassigned genus; 11693 reads), \n\nPiscirickettsiaceae (5 OTUs, attributed to Methylophaga and unassigned genera; 11071 reads), \n\nSaccharospirillaceae (1 unassigned OTU; 10813 reads), Sphingomonadaceae (14 OTUs, attributed \n\nto Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas and unassigned genera; 7447 reads), Cohaesibacteraceae (2 \n\nCohaesibacter OTUs, 7165 reads), and Rhizobiaceae (7 OTUs, attributed to Agrobacterium and \n\nunassigned genera; 4730 reads).  \n\n\n\n257 \n \n\nIsolates from the family Erythrobacteraceae (assigned to the genera Altererythrobacter, \n\nCitromicrobium, Erythrobacter and Erythromicrobium) obtained in Chapter 3 were overall positive \n\nfor all tested enzymatic activities and PGP traits. Pseudomonas isolates presented amylolytic, \n\nproteolytic, lipolytic (all isolates), cellulolytic, xylanolytic and pectinolytic (only at pH 7.0) activities, \n\nand PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (7 out of 8 isolates), IAA production (including three \n\nisolates producing over 100 \u00b5g mL-1), and ACC deaminase activity (all isolates). Only one isolate was \n\nassigned to the Saccharospirillaceae family, which belonged to the genus Saccharospirillum, and \n\npresented proteolytic and xylanolytic activities, and produced IAA. Isolates belonging to the family \n\nSphingomonadaceae were assigned to the genera Novosphingobium, Parasphingopyxis, Stakelama \n\nand Sphingorabdus, and presented amylolytic, lipolytic, cellulolytic, xylanolytic and pectinolytic \n\n(only at pH 7.0) activities, and PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (one Stakelama isolate), \n\nIAA production (all isolates), siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity and presence of the \n\nnifH gene. Cohaeasibacter isolates presented amylolytic, lipolytic and cellulolytic activities, and \n\nwere able to solubilize phosphate, produce IAA, present ACC deaminase activity, and the nifH gene \n\nwas present. Finally, isolates from the family Rhizobiaceae included the genera Ensifer and \n\nRhizobium, which presented amylolytic, proteolytic and pectinolytic activities (only Ensifer isolates), \n\nand lipolytic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. PGP activities for this family included phosphate \n\nsolubilization, siderophore and IAA production (one Ensifer isolate producing over 100 \u00b5g mL-1), \n\nACC deaminase activity and presence of the nifH gene.  \n\nIn the culture-dependent methodology, no isolates were obtained from the families \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae (Chapter 3). Members of the genus Devosia (family \n\nHyphomicrobiaceae) have been isolated from plants from root nodules, are able to perform nitrate \n\nand nitrite reduction, and the genes for nodulation protein D and nifH have been detected, which \n\nare required for nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Rivas et al., 2003). The genus \n\nMethylophaga (family Piscirickettsiaceae) has been associated with PGP traits such as IAA and \n\nammonium production and ACC deaminase activity (Bal et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nInterestingly, the AG core predominant family Halomonadaceae was not observed in the BG core, \n\nand the BG core families Hyphomicrobiaceae, Saccharospirillaceae and Cohaesibacteraceae were \n\nnot observed in the AG core.   \n\n\n\n258 \n \n\nDoes a rose, by any other name, smell just as sweet? \n\nThe ever-growing application of high-throughput sequencing has triggered the need for automated \n\nbioinformatics tools that allow for the analysis of an extremely large amount of information in a \n\nsmall number of steps and in relatively little time. Two pipelines have dominated the field of \n\nbacterial 16S rRNA gene analysis obtained from high-throughput sequencing techniques: Mothur \n\n(Schloss et al., 2009) and QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010). The latter was used in the present work, as \n\nis detailed in the Methods section of the present Chapter. There, it is also stated that the \n\nGreengenes database was used as the reference to obtain taxonomic affiliation of the OTUs that \n\nresulted from Illumina-based sequencing. Despite its outdated nature (last updated in 2013), this \n\ndatabase is the default for the taxonomy attribution in the QIIME pipeline, and, for this reason, is \n\ncommonly used when running the QIIME pipeline. The widespread use of the same database is \n\nbeneficial in the sense that it allows for an easier and more reliable comparison of results, however, \n\nsome attention should be given to the output it creates. \n\n \n\nIn the present work, one of our goals was to compare the diversity observed in the culture-based \n\napproach in Chapter 3 with the most abundant groups observed in a high-throughput sequencing \n\napproach. In doing so, several inaccuracies were observed in the attributions of the taxa names for \n\nseveral different OTUs, and in different taxonomic levels.  \n\nThe taxonomic attribution of the lowest taxonomic level obtained from the Greengenes output was \n\nmanually compared against the databases/platforms: LPSN (Euz\u00e9by, 1997), EzTaxon (Yoon et al., \n\n2016), and SILVA (Quast et al., 2013). Overall, Greengenes attributed at least one inaccurate taxa \n\nlevel for approximately 20 % of our OTUs. Roughly half of these occurrences (393 OTUs) differ from \n\nwhat is consistently stated by the other databases -- e.g., in Greengenes, the genus \n\nMarinilactibacillus is attributed to the family Aerococcaceae, while the other databases file it under \n\nthe family Carnobacteriaceae. In 315 OTUs the Greengenes attribution was also not consistent \n\namong the other databases -- e.g., the family Mycobacteriaceae is affiliated to the order \n\nActinomycetales in the Greengenes and LPSN database, while it is under the order \n\nCorynebacteriales in the EzTaxon and SILVA databases. In the specific case of the genus \n\nAnaerospora (10 OTUs in our data), the misattribution occurred at all taxonomic levels (family, \n\norder, class and phylum) for this Firmicutes-affiliated genus that the Greengenes database had \n\nattributed to Proteobacteria. \n\n\n\n259 \n \n\nAffiliation misattributions may have occurred for two main reasons: (i) in the four years since the \n\nGreengenes database was last updated, there may have been changes in taxa names -- e.g., species \n\nfrom the genus Agrobacterium (32 OTUs in our data) have been transferred to other genera, \n\naccording to LPSN, SILVA and the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes \n\n(www.the-icsp.org), and this genus no longer exists in the EzTaxon database; (ii) erroneous taxa \n\nnames were introduced in the Greengenes database upon its construction, and have yet to be \n\ncorrected. Alternatives to the Greengenes database should be sought after and applied, in order to \n\nhave an updated and accurate record of taxonomic affiliations, nonetheless keeping in mind that \n\nno database appears to be exhaustively correct. The Society for General Microbiology \n\n(www.microbiologyonline.org.uk) advocates for LPSN to find the correct name of a given bacterium, \n\nhowever this platform -- and/or its taxonomy browser -- is not wholly updated on a regular basis. \n\nRegardless of the used database, the output generated by these pipelines in terms of taxonomic \n\naffiliations should be critically examined before being discussed in publications.  \n\n\n\n260 \n \n\nConclusions \n\nA considerably diverse community of bacteria resides in the inner tissues of H. portulacoides. Here, \n\nwe observed a total of 3593 bacterial OTUs that comprised five main phyla and several minor ones, \n\n85 classes, 182 families and 232 genera. We have determined the core bacterial endophytome of \n\nthe halophyte using high-throughput sequencing and thorough analysis with high replication, and \n\nthe results obtained evidence significant differences in the core endophytome in the AG and BG \n\ntissues.  \n\nAnalysis of sequence similarity allowed us to identify several families in the core endophytome of \n\nAG and BG tissues in the present work. Previous works, including our isolation effort in Chapter 3, \n\nhave exposed members of those families as pertaining several enzymatic activities and PGP traits, \n\nsuggesting a significant ecological role for the diversity that is consistent in the halophyte.  \n\nThe results obtained can be used to, not only comprehend the existing community, but also as a \n\npossible basis to predict effects of a disturbance, such as the presence of metals. The integrated \n\nknowledge obtained from trait analysis in the culture-dependent approach and the information \n\nretrieved from the culture-independent approach should be taken into account when considering \n\nthe design of a bacterial consortium to apply in a PGP and/or phytoremediation setting.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n261 \n \n\nReferences \n\nAkinsanya, M.

contamination in Ria de Aveiro \n\nThe contamination observed in Ria de Aveiro, especially in the Laranjo Bay, has been a subject of \n\nstudy for decades, and will likely be so for many years to come. The optimistic prediction of Pereira \n\net al. (1998a) that the Hg levels in the basin would return to background values in 20 years is clearly \n\nnot a reality. Nearly 20 years since the publication, contamination is still observed, as is the gradient \n\nof contaminants from the effluent discharge site to other sites of the basin.  \n\nIt was also observed that the halophyte Halimione portulacoides is able to accumulate several \n\nmetals in its tissues, mainly in the BG tissues. Endophytic isolates from contaminated and non-\n\ncontaminated sites revealed PGP activity in several in vitro assays, and Pseudomonas spp. isolates \n\nfrom contaminated sites showed ability to promote in vivo growth of the model plant Arabidopsis \n\nthaliana. This evidences the role that endophytic bacteria play in the endosphere of plants that \n\nintervene in accumulation of contaminants and in the phytoremediation of contaminated soils. This \n\nrole has also been recently observed in other plants regarding metal contamination (e.g., Pan et al., \n\n2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n284 \n \n\nConsiderations on the description of novel bacterial species \n\nTaxonomy and the description of new taxa have a reputation of being composed of strict rules. \n\nDuring the description of ten novel species from five different genera in the present work, it was \n\nobserved that this statement is both true and untrue. On the one hand, classes of tests are required \n\nfor the description of novel taxa, such as genomic sequence-based tests (e.g., 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequence), biochemical and phenotypical tests. In the case of specific taxa, e.g. those to be included \n\nin the family Halomonadaceae, an extensive list of tests exists for each class of tests. This is what \n\nmakes the initial statement true: rules are in place so that researchers are required to perform a \n\ncertain number and type of tests. On the other hand, the way these tests are performed is not as \n\nstrict. A number of different methods may be used to assess, for example, the range and optima \n\nfor temperature, pH and salt requirements: tests may be performed on liquid or solid media, the \n\nexact points of temperature/pH/salt to test are chosen by the researchers, as is the duration and \n\nseveral other aspects of the assays. To make matters worse, details of the conditions that the \n\nresearchers use in their experiments are rarely described in the published papers. This makes \n\ncomparison of such a simple test -- assessing range and optima of growth conditions -- a highly \n\nsubjective matter. This subjectivity, however, is not common to all tests since, for some biochemical \n\ntests, researchers are required to assay their putative novel species, and closely related reference \n\ntype strains in parallel, in the same conditions. Nevertheless, parallel testing is not a requirement \n\nfor all biochemical and phenotypic tests. This drawback could begin to be surpassed if it was \n\nrequired of the researchers to describe all methodology in detail, since it is an essential part (if not \n\nthe essential part) of strain comparison for taxa description purposes in the case of tests that are \n\nnot required to be ran in parallel for novel and reference strains.  \n\n \n\nThe genomic sequence-based criteria for strain comparison with the aim of species delineation \n\nhave been chiefly based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. However, since the sequence of this gene \n\ndoes not efficiently discriminate closely related species (de la Haba et al., 2010), its use for studying \n\nsome taxa was deemed insufficient. In those cases, the information given by the 16S rRNA gene has \n\nbeen complemented with other genomic sequence-based approaches to aid in bacterial species \n\ndelineation. Such approaches include the concatenation of sequences of a number of housekeeping \n\ngenes that act as molecular clocks, as was performed for the description of novel taxa of \n\nMicrobacterium and Salinicola in Chapter 4. Consequently, this MLSA approach uses more \n\ninformation, in terms of number of nucleotides, than the 16S rRNA gene sequence approach. As \n\n\n\n285 \n \n\nbacterial genome sequencing becomes a reality for a larger number of research groups, the number \n\nof nucleotides that may be used for strain comparison is vastly greater. Genome comparison ought \n\nto be the next obvious step as input for strain comparison and to help delineate bacterial species. \n\nAccordingly, bioinformatics tools that allow for this comparison have been developed and \n\noptimized, to the point where even as little as 20 to 25 % of the genome of a strain is estimated to \n\nsuffice in giving a stable result to be used as sequence-based criteria in species delineation (Richter \n\n&amp; Rossell\u00f3-M\u00f3ra, 2009).  \n\nThe whole genome sequencing era should make it possible to have enough information that gives \n\na highly reliable answer to, at least, which genus a strain belongs to. This determination could give \n\nway for other methods to be considered obsolete for these genus confirmation assays, such as \n\nlisting polar lipids, fatty acids or determining dominant ubiquinones. Undeniably, these traits \n\nshould be defined for a genus, for example at the moment of genus description. But perhaps their \n\ndetermination in the description of subsequent species could be considered redundant in \n\ndetermining something that is easily known with sufficient genome-based information. \n\nAdditionally, common characteristics determined in wet lab context such as determination of G+C \n\ncontent and performing DNA-DNA hybridization ought to be replaced with in silico determination \n\nof these traits. These in silico determinations have relevant advantages when compared to their \n\nwet lab counterparts, namely (i) no need to use a specialized laboratory to perform the method, (ii) \n\nno need for sensitive and error prone methodologies, and (iii) the ability to build an additive \n\ndatabase (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nThe ever-changing sciences of taxonomy and systematics face new challenges with the advances in \n\nand greater availability of genome sequencing. These challenges should be met with \n\ncomprehensive discussion so as to enhance the process of description of novel taxa and get as much \n\ninformation as possible from genome-based methods. It is of imperative importance to take these \n\nnew techniques into account as soon as possible, since over 750 novel species of bacteria were \n\npublished in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology in 2016 alone.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n286 \n \n\nFinal considerations on studies on endophytic bacteria \n\nAs discussed in Chapters 3 and 5, culturable bacteria usually represent only a small fraction of the \n\nbacteria present in a community. In the present work, the efforts applied to isolate endophytic \n\nbacteria from H. portulacoides yielded a considerable number of isolates, when compared to similar \n\ntypes of studies in the literature. This may have been the result of using three different culture \n\nmedia to isolate bacteria, as it allowed coverage of nutritional needs of oligotrophs, of bacteria that \n\nrequire high salt contents, and of bacteria that grow in regular nutritive media. Amplicon-based \n\nculture-independent methods used to study communities present advantages in comparison to \n\nculture-dependent methods, especially when the depth of the information obtained is considered. \n\nNevertheless, it is still highly relevant to study the culturable fraction. An assessment of the \n\nresponse of a community exposed to contaminants can be performed by analysing the culturable \n\nfraction from contaminated and non-contaminated samples, as discussed in Chapter 3. \n\nAdditionally, having a collection of isolates allowed for a deeper characterization of a vast selection \n\nof traits, which is not yet achievable with the current tools in a culture-independent approach.  \n\nHigh-throughput sequencing allowed the detection of an additional dominant phylum that had not \n\nbeen observed in the culturable methodology. In this sense, the present work contributed to \n\nfurther show that culture-based methods do not suffice to have a comprehensive understanding of \n\na bacterial community, even when multiple nutritional needs are considered in the culture media \n\nused.  \n\nThere are obstacles in the analysis of endophytic bacterial communities using culture-independent \n\nmethods. Primarily, the interference of host DNA in PCR amplification when using universal primers \n\nthat target the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence. The majority of methods available to avoid this \n\ninterference are based on processes that also induce loss of information of the bacterial fraction. \n\nThe PNA blocker approach appears to be adequate in the sense that, in theory, there is no loss of \n\ninformation in the process of obtaining the community DNA sample, nor in the PCR amplification. \n\nIn our case, using the PNA blockers allowed for an in-depth analysis of the diversity, in spite of a \n\nmarked host DNA presence. This approach allowed us to carry out Illumina-based sequencing to \n\naccomplish our aim of performing a deep and extensive characterization of the bacterial diversity \n\nin the endosphere of H. portulacoides.   \n\n\n\n287 \n \n\nDiscussion of main and specific goals \n\nThe present work accomplished its main goal of characterizing the endophytic bacterial community \n\nof the salt marsh halophyte H. portulacoides.  \n\nRegarding the specific goals listed in Chapter 2, these were also achieved: in Chapter 3, a \n\ncomprehensive collection of 665 endophytic isolates was obtained from three sites with different \n\nlevels of metal(loid) contamination. This collection was subjected to PCR-fingerprinting, yielding \n\n467 distinct strains, which were then explored for their taxonomy and relevant characteristics such \n\nas production of enzymes and presence of plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. Promising isolates \n\nfor PGP were detected and further studied for their in vivo abilities in a model plant, specifically \n\nthose belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. The endophytic bacteria collection was also explored \n\nfor the presence of undescribed taxa and, in Chapter 4, ten novel bacterial species are described in \n\ndetail according to taxa-specific regulations. Finally, the diversity of endophytic bacteria residing in \n\nhealthy specimens of H. portulacoides was extensively explored by combining knowledge from \n\nculture-dependent (Chapter 3) and -independent methods (Chapter 5).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n288 \n \n\nConsiderations regarding the proposed hypotheses \n\nFour hypotheses were proposed in Chapter 2 and explored throughout the work.  \n\nThe first hypothesis stated that the endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides is a hotspot for \n\nbacterial diversity, and this was in fact observed throughout the work. In Chapter 3, culture-based \n\nmethodologies were applied to obtain a large collection of endophytic bacteria, and these efforts \n\nrevealed that the culturable endosphere of H. portulacoides comprised four phyla, seven classes, \n\nfourty families and seventy nine genera. Culture-independent methods used in Chapter 5 \n\nattempted at a deeper analysis of the diversity and allowed identification of 37 phyla, 85 classes, \n\n182 families and 232 genera. Considering these numbers, the results supported the first hypothesis.  \n\nThe second hypothesis stated that the presence of metal(loid)s influences the structure and \n\ndiversity of the endophytic bacteria of H. portulacoides. This hypothesis was only tested for the \n\nculturable fraction of the endophytic bacteria of the halophyte, and it was indeed observed that \n\nthe structure and diversity was significantly different in samples collected from metal(loid) \n\ncontaminated and non-contaminated sites.  \n\nThe third hypothesis stated that the endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes \n\nbacteria that have potential for promoting plant growth. This was observed in Chapter 3 where \n\nseveral isolates obtained in the culturable fraction presented one or more PGP traits, and where \n\nPseudomonas spp. isolates also exhibited antagonistic properties against known pathogens, and \n\nthe ability to induce in vivo plant elongation.  \n\nThe fourth hypothesis stated that the endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes a \n\nplethora of novel bacteria taxa. Information based on partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of \n\nrepresentative strains in the endophytic bacteria collection revealed 29 putative novel species, 7 of \n\nwhich represented putative novel genera. From these, ten novel species were described (Chapter \n\n4) and are now (or will be soon) members of the known diversity in the domain Bacteria.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n289 \n \n\nConclusions \n\nThe endosphere of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides is a hotspot for bacterial diversity which \n\ndiffers according to the presence of metal(loid)s in the sediment, and should be further explored \n\nfor their potential to aid in phytoremediation. The analysis of this unexplored microbial hotspot \n\nalso revealed a plethora of undescribed diversity, exposing a promising reservoir of new bacterial \n\ntaxa.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFuture work \n\nIn the present work several of the obtained endophytic isolates exhibited an enormous potential \n\nfor promoting plant growth. In Chapter 3, Pseudomonas spp. isolates were further analyzed for \n\ntheir PGP potential and in vitro experiments revealed the ability of the most promising isolates to \n\npromote growth of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Future work should be performed in a \n\nsimilar manner with other promising isolates, so as to assess their ability to participate in tasks such \n\nas (i) promote growth of different plants, including those used in phytoremediation processes; (ii) \n\nincrease tolerance to contaminants, especially for those isolates obtained from metal(loid) \n\ncontaminated sites; (iii) increase tolerance to salt, since the isolates were collected from a salt-\n\ntolerant plant.  \n\nSeveral strains in the endophytic collection belonged to novel bacterial species. Ten novel species \n\nare described in the present work, however, many more remain obscured from the known bacterial \n\ndiversity. Future work should be performed in order to unveil this diversity, and, during such an \n\nendeavor, the techniques used should include those which allow for cumulative knowledge to \n\ncomplement databases, such as genome sequencing, as discussed in Chapter 4 and in the present \n\nChapter. \n\nFinally, future work should include a culture-independent approach to analyze the bacterial \n\nendophytome from H. portulacoides sampled from sites with intermediate and high metal(loid) \n\ncontamination. This would allow for a deeper analysis of such an endophytome and also allow for \n\ncomparison with the results obtained in Chapter 5, potentially revealing a highly adapted \n\ncommunity in a contaminated environment. \n\n \n\n\n\n290 \n \n\nReferences \n\nde la Haba, R.
