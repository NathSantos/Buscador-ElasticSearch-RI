This drift is located between 1000 and 2000 m water depth on the Alentejo margin continental \n\nslope. The Sines Drift is bounded by four major morphologic features: the 1.4 km high Pereira de Sousa \n\nFault escarpment to the west, the upper continental slope to the east and the Set\u00fabal and S\u00e3o Vicente \n\ncanyons to the north and south, respectively. \n\nThis work presents a seismic stratigraphic analysis and proposes an evolutionary model for the Sines \n\nDrift, as well as the identification of its main driving mechanisms and constraints. In pursuing such \n\nobjectives, the following dataset was used: i) new and unpublished seismic reflection profiles acquired \n\nduring the MOWER/CONDRIBER cruise in September-October 2014; ii) pre-existent multichannel \n\nseismic profiles BIGSETS, STEAM and GSI; iii) SWIM multibeam bathymetry; iv) lithostratigraphic \n\nand chronological data from Site U1391 of IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program) Expedition 339 \n\ncarried out in 2011-2012. \n\nThree evolutionary phases are identified for the Sines Drift development: 1) a sheeted-contourite-drift \n\nphase (<5.3-3.2 Ma) built since the Late Miocene by an initially weak flowing MOW; 2) a mounded-\n\ncontourite-drift phase (3.2-0.7 Ma) from Late Pliocene to Early Quaternary times characterized by a \n\nmounded drift in the south and sheeted in the north, with a succession of sinuous N-S paleomoats in the \n\neast built as a result of a MOW enhancement; and 3) a plastered-contourite-drift phase from Mid-\n\nPleistocene (0.7 Ma) till the present-day, characterized by the present depositional (sandy-muddy drifts) \n\nand erosional (moats) contourite features associated with two major events of MOW intensification. \n\nThe growth of the Sines Drift was constrained by seafloor paleomorphologies that resulted from the \n\nrifting processes of the Southwest Portuguese margin, inherited from the Mesozoic rifting phases. The \n\npaleomorphologies provided accommodation space for drift growth and conditioned its overall \n\narchitecture. The N-S horsts and grabens built during the Mesozoic rifting confined drift deposition and \n\ndid not allow its lateral migration. \n\nThe formation of the Sines Drift has also been influenced by climatic fluctuations and sea-level changes \n\nespecially during the Quaternary. The succession of sinuous paleomoats beneath the present-day moat \n\nsuggests a persistent and northward flowing MOW with several phases of enhancement. \n\nIt was also perceived that the S\u00e3o Vicente and Set\u00fabal canyons took most of the downslope sediment \n\nsupply, as well as the occurrence of mass-movement processes in the west associated with the steep \n\ngradient of the Pereira de Sousa escarpment. All these results suggest the Sines Drift had a complex \n\nevolution controlled by several factors at different scales. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sines Contourite Drift, Southwest Portuguese margin, Mediterranean Outflow Water, \n\nseismic interpretation, IODP Site U1391  \n\n\n\nii \n\nRESUMO \n\nContornitos s\u00e3o corpos sedimentares depositados ou retrabalhados por correntes de fundo que circulam \n\nparalelamente aos contornos batim\u00e9tricos da margem. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos contornitos \u00e9 afetada, a longo e \n\ncurto prazo, por fatores externos e/ou internos que podem modificar o padr\u00e3o de circula\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\ncorrentes. Os dep\u00f3sitos contorn\u00edticos podem atingir dimens\u00f5es consider\u00e1veis com v\u00e1rios quil\u00f3metros \n\nde largura e comprimento, os quais conservam informa\u00e7\u00e3o paleoclim\u00e1tica e paleoceanogr\u00e1fica. Os \n\ncontornitos tamb\u00e9m desempenham um papel importante no estudo dos riscos naturais submarinos, \n\nassociados \u00e0 ocorr\u00eancia de deslizamentos, e na ind\u00fastria de explora\u00e7\u00e3o petrol\u00edfera, como potenciais \n\nreservat\u00f3rios e selantes. \n\nUm extenso Sistema Deposicional Contorn\u00edtico (CDS, Contourite Depositional System) formou-se no \n\nGolfo de C\u00e1dis, desde o fim do Mioc\u00e9nico Superior (5.33 Ma), pela a\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00c1gua de Sa\u00edda \n\nMediterr\u00e2nica (MOW, Mediterranean Outflow Water). Este CDS abrange v\u00e1rios dep\u00f3sitos contorn\u00edticos \n\ne outras formas sedimentares, deposicionais e erosivas, ao longo da margem continental Sul e Sudoeste \n\nIb\u00e9rica. \n\nO Contornito de Sines, localizado na margem Sudoeste Portuguesa, \u00e9 um contornito distal do CDS do \n\nGolfo de C\u00e1dis. Este corpo situa-se entre 1000 e 2000 m de profundidade na Bacia do Alentejo, com \n\naproximadamente 70 km de comprimento, 40 km de largura, 1 km de espessura, morfologia assim\u00e9trica \n\ne configura\u00e7\u00e3o agradante com inclina\u00e7\u00e3o para oeste. O Contornito de Sines est\u00e1 limitado por quatro \n\nmorfoestruturas: a escarpa da Falha Pereira de Sousa com 1.4 km de altura a oeste, a plataforma \n\ncontinental a este e os canh\u00f5es de Set\u00fabal e S\u00e3o Vicente a norte e sul, respetivamente.  \n\nEste trabalho apresenta uma an\u00e1lise sismostratigr\u00e1fica e prop\u00f5e um modelo evolutivo para o Contornito \n\nde Sines, al\u00e9m da identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos principais mecanismos e constrangimentos que controlaram a sua \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o. Para atingir estes objetivos, recorreu-se ao seguinte conjunto de dados: i) linhas de reflex\u00e3o \n\ns\u00edsmica multicanal n\u00e3o publicadas, adquiridas durante a campanha MOWER/CONDRIBER em \n\nsetembro-outubro de 2014; ii) linhas de reflex\u00e3o s\u00edsmica multicanal, pr\u00e9-existentes, dos projetos \n\nBIGSETS, STEAM e GSI; iii) batimetria multifeixe SWIM e iv) dados litostratigr\u00e1ficos e cronol\u00f3gicos \n\nda sondagem U1391 da Expedi\u00e7\u00e3o 339 do IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), realizada em \n\n2011-2012. \n\nA metodologia utilizada durante este trabalho consistiu em interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de estratigrafia s\u00edsmica, an\u00e1lise \n\nbatim\u00e9trica, calibra\u00e7\u00e3o e correla\u00e7\u00e3o cronostratigr\u00e1fica dos horizontes e unidades s\u00edsmicas com a \n\nsondagem U1391 e representa\u00e7\u00e3o gr\u00e1fica das propriedades litol\u00f3gicas e f\u00edsicas da sondagem referida. \n\nA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o sismostratigr\u00e1fica dos dados apresentados permitiu identificar seis unidades s\u00edsmicas \n\n(U1 a U6), com idades compreendidas entre o Mioc\u00e9nico Superior e o Presente. Estas unidades foram \n\ndepositadas sobre uma superf\u00edcie basal erosiva (B) e est\u00e3o separadas por cinco horizontes s\u00edsmicos (H2 \n\na H6), que marcam descontinuidades na sucess\u00e3o s\u00edsmica. As unidades s\u00edsmicas apresentam f\u00e1cies \n\ntransparente a maior profundidade, com configura\u00e7\u00e3o em cunha, que transita para uma f\u00e1cies \n\nestratificada de elevada amplitude e configura\u00e7\u00e3o lobular a menor profundidade. \n\nA an\u00e1lise litostratigr\u00e1fica da sondagem U1391 permitiu a calibra\u00e7\u00e3o cronostratigr\u00e1fica das unidades \n\ns\u00edsmicas interpretadas, bem como a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da sua litologia. As unidades U2 (onde a sondagem \n\nU1391 atingiu a sua m\u00e1xima profundidade) e U3, situadas entre os 671.5 e 566.1 m de profundidade, \n\nt\u00eam idades compreendidas entre o Plioc\u00e9nico Superior e o Quatern\u00e1rio Inferior (3.2-2.5 Ma). Estas \n\nunidades s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddas por vasa carbonatada, de composi\u00e7\u00e3o dolom\u00edtica (~0.87 m) aos 632 m de \n\nprofundidade e um debrito (~0.35 m) aos 604 m de profundidade. \u00c0s unidades U4 e U5, recuperadas \n\nentre 566.1 e 196.1 m de profundidade, foram atribu\u00eddas idades entre o Pleistoc\u00e9nico Inferior a M\u00e9dio \n\n\n\niii \n\n(2.5-0.7 Ma) e s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddas por contornitos finos intercalados por sucess\u00f5es de vasa carbonatada. A \n\nunidade sedimentar mais recente, U6, depositou-se desde o Pleistoc\u00e9nico M\u00e9dio (0.7 Ma) at\u00e9 ao \n\nPresente. A unidade U6 \u00e9 composta por altern\u00e2ncia de dep\u00f3sitos contorn\u00edticos finos e grosseiros \n\nrecuperados entre 196.1 m de profundidade e o fundo oce\u00e2nico. Estes dep\u00f3sitos apresentam sucess\u00f5es \n\ncom bigrada\u00e7\u00e3o, grada\u00e7\u00e3o normal e inversa (separadas por contactos gradacionais, bioturbados e, mais \n\nraramente, descontinuidades). Esta unidade cont\u00e9m seis intervalos contorn\u00edticos arenosos, areias finas a \n\ngrosseiras, a 2, 50, 83, 96, 115 e 150 m de profundidade. \n\nForam identificadas tr\u00eas fases na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o deposicional do Contornito de Sines: 1) uma primeira fase \n\nde contornito com configura\u00e7\u00e3o em camada (sheeted drift) (<5.3-3.2 Ma), constru\u00edda desde o final do \n\nMioc\u00e9nico Superior, por uma corrente MOW de fraca intensidade; 2) uma fase de contornito monticular \n\n(mounded drift) (3.2-0.7 Ma), desde o Plioc\u00e9nico Superior ao Quatern\u00e1rio Inferior, caracterizada por \n\numa morfologia monticular a sul e agradante a norte, com uma sucess\u00e3o de paleo-fossas sinuosas ao \n\nlongo da margem continental a este, que atestam a ocorr\u00eancia de uma intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o moderada a elevada \n\nda MOW e 3) uma fase final de contornito agradante (plastered drift), desde o Pleistoc\u00e9nico M\u00e9dio (0.7 \n\nMa) at\u00e9 ao Presente, caracterizada pelas atuais formas deposicionais (contornitos argilosos a arenosos) \n\ne erosivas (fossas), associadas a dois eventos de intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da MOW. \n\nA forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Contornito de Sines ter\u00e1 tido in\u00edcio no Mioc\u00e9nico Superior, possivelmente ap\u00f3s o final \n\nda Crise de Salinidade do Messiniano, que afetou a regi\u00e3o Mediterr\u00e2nica entre 5.33 e 5.96 Ma, a qual \n\nteve repercuss\u00f5es dr\u00e1sticas para a circula\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica entre o Mediterr\u00e2neo e o Atl\u00e2ntico. Ap\u00f3s a Crise \n\nde Salinidade do Messiniano e o restabelecimento da circula\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do Estreito de Gibraltar, a MOW \n\npossu\u00eda fraca intensidade. A sucess\u00e3o de paleo-fossas subjacentes \u00e0 fossa atual sugere uma corrente \n\nsemipermanente e persistente ao longo da margem Sudoeste Portuguesa, em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a norte, com v\u00e1rios \n\neventos de intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nA edifica\u00e7\u00e3o do Contornito de Sines foi constrangida pelas paleo-morfologias do fundo do mar que \n\nresultaram dos processos de rifting, herdados das fases de rifting Mesoz\u00f3icas na margem Sudoeste \n\nPortuguesa. Estas paleo-morfologias forneceram espa\u00e7o de acomoda\u00e7\u00e3o para o crescimento do \n\ncontornito e condicionaram a sua arquitetura deposicional. Os horsts e grabens, com orienta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\naproximada N-S, resultantes do rifting Mesoz\u00f3ico, confinaram a forma\u00e7\u00e3o do contornito impedindo a \n\nsua migra\u00e7\u00e3o lateral.  \n\nA edifica\u00e7\u00e3o do Contornito de Sines foi tamb\u00e9m influenciada por varia\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas e eust\u00e1ticas, \n\nespecialmente durante a sua \u00faltima fase de desenvolvimento. Durante o Quatern\u00e1rio, os eventos de \n\nintensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da MOW correlacionam-se com dois eventos clim\u00e1ticos do Pleistoc\u00e9nico, registados na \n\nregi\u00e3o Mediterr\u00e2nica e nos dep\u00f3sitos contorn\u00edticos do Golfo de C\u00e1dis: o Middle Pleistocene Revolution \n\n(0.7-0.78 Ma) e o Late Quaternary Discontinuity (0.4 Ma).  \n\nOs sedimentos que constituem o Contornito de Sines s\u00e3o maioritariamente sucess\u00f5es contorn\u00edticas de \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o carbonatada, com uma maior componente biog\u00e9nica na primeira fase de desenvolvimento \n\n(sheeted drift), e uma maior componente silicicl\u00e1stica (contornitos arenosos), na \u00faltima fase de \n\ndesenvolvimento (plastered drift). A componente biog\u00e9nica na primeira fase provavelmente indica a \n\nocorr\u00eancia de fen\u00f3menos de afloramento costeiro e deposi\u00e7\u00e3o hemipel\u00e1gica ao longo da margem Oeste \n\nPortuguesa, enquanto que a maior contribui\u00e7\u00e3o silicicl\u00e1stica na \u00faltima fase est\u00e1 associada a eventos de \n\nintensifica\u00e7\u00e3o da MOW. O Contornito de Sines evoluiu de um sistema deposicional inicialmente \n\ncarbonatado para silicicl\u00e1stico na \u00faltima fase de desenvolvimento, testemunhando varia\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nintensidade da MOW. \n\nOs sedimentos carreados para a margem do Alentejo s\u00e3o maioritariamente fornecidos por deposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhemipel\u00e1gica, fen\u00f3menos de afloramento costeiro e resultante de eros\u00e3o da margem continental pela \n\n\n\niv \n\ncircula\u00e7\u00e3o da MOW. O Contornito de Sines n\u00e3o \u00e9 significativamente afetado por processos grav\u00edticos, \n\nsendo registado apenas uma ocorr\u00eancia no Plioc\u00e9nico (debrito de ~0.35 m). A baixa incid\u00eancia de \n\nprocessos grav\u00edticos resulta, provavelmente, da morfologia da margem e da exist\u00eancia dos canh\u00f5es de \n\nSet\u00fabal e S\u00e3o Vicente, que canalizam grande parte do material deslocado. No entanto, existem dep\u00f3sitos \n\nde movimento de massa que afetam o sector ocidental do Contornito de Sines, que est\u00e3o associados ao \n\nelevado declive da escarpa da Falha Pereira de Sousa. A forma\u00e7\u00e3o destes dep\u00f3sitos poder\u00e1 estar \n\nassociada a v\u00e1rios fatores intr\u00ednsecos e extr\u00ednsecos \u00e0 \u00e1rea em estudo. No que se refere aos fatores \n\nintr\u00ednsecos, destaca-se a potencial gera\u00e7\u00e3o de planos de descolamento nas interfaces entre sedimentos \n\ncontorn\u00edticos arenosos e vasosos caso se encontrem sobre press\u00e3o, com excesso de flu\u00eddos e/ou \n\nintercalados por sedimentos menos porosos. No que respeita aos fatores extr\u00ednsecos, a atividade s\u00edsmica \n\nregistada na margem Sudoeste Ib\u00e9rica poder\u00e1 espoletar a ocorr\u00eancia de deslizamentos submarinos no \n\nContornito de Sines. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que o Contornito de Sines teve uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomplexa, controlada por v\u00e1rios fatores, a diferentes escalas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Contornito de Sines, Margem Sudoeste Portuguesa, \u00c1gua de Sa\u00edda Mediterr\u00e2nica, \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica, Sondagem IODP U1391 \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThis study is the result of a long project, which would not have been possible without the support of \n\nmany people, to whom I will convey my gratitude in this humble acknowledgment.  \n\nFirst, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis supervisors, Dr. Ana Cristina Roque and \n\nProf. Dr. Pedro Terrinha, for their knowledge and support since the first day.

These currents flow parallel to the continental margins building up \n\nthick sedimentary features as a result of erosion, transport, reworking and re-deposition of sediments. \n\nContourite drifts can reach up to several kilometers in width and in length, holding important \n\ninformation in their stratigraphic contents. Therefore, contourite drifts represent an important record for \n\npaleoceanographic, paleoclimatic and geohazard studies, as well as potential reservoirs for the oil \n\nindustry (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1993; Mulder et al., 2003; Bryn et al., 2005; Laberg et al., 2005; Rebesco, \n\n2005; Shanmugam, 2006; Viana et al., 2007; Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Brackenridge et al., \n\n2013; Stow et al., 2013; Rebesco et al., 2014).  \n\nThe Contourite Depositional System of the Gulf of Cadiz (GCCDS) has been targeted due to its complex \n\nnature and direct relation with the circulation of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) into the \n\nAtlantic Ocean. This CDS results from the dynamics of the MOW since Messinian times, formed by the \n\nopening of the Strait of Gibraltar and the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.33 to 5.96 Ma ago) \n\n(Cita, 2001; Bache et al., 2012). The GCCDS comprehends contourite drifts in the South and Southwest \n\nIberian margin, namely the Albufeira, Bartolomeu Dias, Faro, Guadalquivir, Huelva, Lagos, Portim\u00e3o, \n\nSagres and the Sines drifts (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Nelson et al., 1993; Sierro et al., 1999; \n\nLlave et al., 2001, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2015; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, 2011, 2015; March\u00e8s \n\net al., 2007, 2010; Roque et al., 2012). The construction of the GCCDS was influenced by several factors \n\nassociated with its tectonic and climatic settings, seafloor morphology and bottom-current dynamics \n\n(Faug\u00e8res et al., 1993; Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014). The GCCDS is also \n\ninfluenced by the evolution of the Iberian margin through geological times, since it is located near the \n\nconvergent plate boundary between the Eurasia and the African plate (Gutscher et al., 2002, 2012). \n\nHence, the tectonic setting of the Gulf of Cadiz and the evolution of the Atlantic Ocean are associated \n\nwith the tectonic features of the study area and affect contourite drift deposition.  \n\nThe Sines Contourite Drift (SD) belongs to the extensive CDS of the Gulf of Cadiz (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina \n\net al., 2015). The SD is a sedimentary body located on the Southwest Portuguese margin, between 1000 \n\nand 2000 m water depth on the Alentejo continental slope (Figure 1.1). The SD is bounded by four major \n\nmorphologic features, the 1.4 km high Pereira de Sousa Fault escarpment to the west, the continental \n\nshelf edge to the east, and the Set\u00fabal and S\u00e3o Vicente canyons to the north and south, respectively. The \n\nSD consists of Late Neogene to Quaternary contourite deposits (Pereira and Alves, 2010, 2011, 2013; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015) and was classified as a plastered drift based on seismic data (Hern\u00e1ndez-\n\nMolina et al., 2015). Mougenot (1976) was the first author to identify the SD, based on seismic reflection \n\nprofiles and samples of seabed sediments. His work presented the characterization of the main seismic \n\nand stratigraphic sequences of the Southwest Portuguese margin, the present-day morphology, structures \n\nand the geodynamic evolution of the Portuguese continental shelf. The depositional evolution of the SD \n\nis still undefined, with the works of Alves et al. (2000, 2003) and Pereira and Alves (2010, 2011, 2013) \n\nestablishing the stratigraphic record for the older syn-rift sequences in the Alentejo margin and \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2015) studying the GCCDS and its tectonic, sedimentary and \n\n\n\n2 \n\npaleoceanographic evidences. Thus, the objective of this work is to propose a seismostratigraphic model \n\nfor the Sines Contourite Drift, complemented by an analysis of its depositional evolution, structural \n\ncontrol and paleoceanographic implications.  \n\n \nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Location of the Sines Drift in the Southwest Portuguese margin, between the Set\u00fabal Canyon (North) and the S\u00e3o \n\nVicente Canyon (South).

The pioneer \n\nworks by Heezen and Hollister (1964) and Hollister (1967) established the beginning of a new research \n\nfield, the study of sedimentary features formed by the influence of contour bottom-currents in the deep-\n\nsea.  \n\nContourites were recognized in the seismic record, however their classification and characterization was \n\nstill poorly defined. McCave and Tucholke (1986) and Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999) established the first \n\nclassification systems based on seismic features. Other works also focused on seismic reflection profiles \n\nto diagnostic drifts, with a comprehensive review of all the known drift types and representative \n\nexamples (Rebesco and Stow, 2001; Stow et al., 2002a,b; Rebesco, 2005; Shanmugam, 2006, 2008; \n\nRebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). The steady growth of knowledge allowed for a better understanding \n\nof the geometry and temporal evolution of contourite processes and led to the definition of Contourite \n\nDepositional Systems and Contourite Depositional Complexes (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003; Rebesco \n\nand Camerlenghi, 2008). Most of this knowledge emerged from studying contourites formed by the \n\ninfluence of the MOW (Garc\u00eda et al., 2009; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011, 2015; Roque et al., 2012; \n\nRebesco et al., 2014; Llave et al., 2015). Contourite research also grew in the technological domain, \n\nthanks to IODP and ODP Expeditions, such as IODP Expedition 339 in 2011-2012 that focused on the \n\nstudy of MOW paleocirculation along the Iberian margin. These expeditions contributed to a better \n\n\n\n3 \n\nknowledge of paleo-climate, oceanic gateways, sea-level and tectonic controls on sediment architecture \n\nalong continental margins, in the Mediterranean (ODP Leg 107), North Atlantic (IODP 303, IODP 306, \n\nIODP 307, IODP 319 and IODP 342), Pacific and Southern Oceans (ODP Leg 181, ODP Leg 194, IODP \n\n317 and IODP 318). \n\nThe deep-water processes and environments behind contourite formation in the GCCDS are closely \n\nrelated to the paleoceanography and physical oceanography of the MOW (Nelson et al., 1999) (Figure \n\n1.2). The hydrography of the present MOW and its pathways were laid down by Zenk (1970, 1975), \n\nAmbar and Howe (1979) Ambar (1983), Harvey (1982) and Baringer and Price (1999). In the 2000\u2019s, \n\nthe use of floats established precise MOW trajectories and allowed the identification of meddies \n\nformation along the Southwest Iberian margin (Bower et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 2002; Ambar et al., \n\n2002, 2008; Serra and Ambar, 2002; Serra et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Timeline of previous works made in contourite research till the present-day, with a considerable increase since \n1999, depicting the evolution of knowledge and importance in the marine geology and the oceanography study fields.  \n\n \n\nThe circulation of the MOW through the Pliocene and the Quaternary, and its relation to climate \n\nchanges, has been studied through several methods: i) planktonic and benthic foraminiferal ?18O records \n\nin the Mediterranean Sea (Becker et al., 2006); ii) molecular biomarkers (C37 alkenones, n-nonacosane \n\nand n-hexacosanol) together with benthic ?18O and ?13C data on the Alboran Sea (Cacho et al., 2000, \n\n2002, 2006); iii) comparison of Nd isotopes, ?18O, Mg/Ca-based temperature and bottom water salinity \n\non the Alboran Sea and Northeast Atlantic margin (Kh\u00e9lifi et al., 2009); iv) Nd and Pb isotope records \n\nfrom authigenic ferromanganese coatings of sediments in gravity cores, on the Gulf of Cadiz and along \n\nthe Portuguese margin (Stumpf et al., 2010); v) decline and extinction of certain deep-water benthic \n\nforaminifers in the Mediterranean Sea and outside this region (Hayward et al., 2009).  \n\nThe MOW shows a distinct behaviour under different climatic conditions, therefore global climatic \n\nindicators were also studied through different approaches and in different regions: i) comparison of \n\noxygen isotopic, ?18O, composition of benthic foraminifera on ODP Site 1014 with ?18O record from \n\n\n\n4 \n\nODP Site 846, from different regions of the Pacific (Ravelo et al., 2004); ii) analysis of planktic \n\nforaminifers and ostracods of sediment records in the North Atlantic Ocean (Dowsett et al., 1992) and \n\nat IODP Site U1391 in the Southwest Iberian margin (Singh et al., 2015); iii) paleoclimate modelling \n\nsimulations in the Mediterranean and European region, supported by geologic data (Haywood et al., \n\n2000, 2002; Tzanova and Herbert, 2015); iv) parameters from cores of sediment records on the Gulf of \n\nCadiz (grainsize, sediment composition, benthic foraminiferal assemblage and benthic foraminiferal \n\nstable isotope analysis) (Rogerson et al., 2006, 2011; Hodell et al., 2015; Voelker et al., 2015; Kaboth \n\net al., 2016; S\u00e1nchez Go\u00f1i et al., 2016);  \n\n \n\n1.3 Outline at a glance \n\nThis dissertation comprises eight chapters:  \n\n?

The Southwest Iberian margin has a continental slope gently dipping to the west, cut in the \n\nsouth by the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon that sources the Horseshore Abyssal Plain, and in the north by the \n\nSet\u00fabal and Lisboa Canyons that reach the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Mougenot et al., 1979; Alves et al., \n\n2003; Terrinha et al., 2009; Figure 2.1). The continental margin deepens west of the Pereira de Sousa \n\nScarp to the Tagus Abyssal Plain, at depths of ~5000 m. The Southwest Iberian margin has other \n\nprominent features, such as the Pr\u00edncipe de Avis Seamounts, the Descobridores Seamounts and the \n\nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal Plateau (Mougenot et al., 1979).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Localization of the Sines Drift and the main Portuguese sedimentary basins and their relation with the other basins \nin the Central and North Atlantic due to the rifting of the North Atlantic (Pereira and Alves, 2011). \n\n \n\n2.1 Geodynamic Evolution of the Southwest Iberian margin \n\nThe Southwest Iberian margin is located near the Eurasia-Nubia plate boundary in the North Atlantic. \n\nThe Iberian margin began to develop during the early stages of continental rifting from the Triassic to \n\nthe Early Cretaceous, which led to the Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean (Pinheiro et al., 1996; \n\nRasmussen et al., 1998; Alves et al., 2002, 2006, 2009; Figure 2.2). In the Iberian margin, a group of \n\nMesozoic rift basins evolved from south to north: the Algarve, Alentejo, Peniche, Lusitanian, Porto and \n\nGalicia Basins, which share a common rift-to-drift evolution insered in the context of the Mediterranean \n\nand the Atlantic regions (Alves et al., 2009, 2013; Pereira and Alves, 2010, 2011; Ribeiro, 2013b; \n\n  SD \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTerrinha et al., 2013a; Terrinha et al., 2013b). The rocks that constitute the basement are part of the \n\nHesperian Massif, which incorporates Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks. During the Cenozoic, the \n\nSouthwest Iberian margin evolved as a passive margin subjected to various pulses of compression, \n\nrelated to the Alpine Orogeny (Alves et al., 2003, 2006; Pereira and Alves, 2011, 2013). \n\n \n\n2.1.1 The Late Paleozoic Evolution  \n\n? The Variscan Orogeny \n\nThe basement of the Southwest Iberian margin is comprised by rocks of the Hesperian Massif, a segment \n\nof the Variscan Orogenic Belt that extends all over Europe. The orogenic belt, formed during the Late \n\nPaleozoic (Devonian-Permian) by the convergence and collision of two major continents, Laurasia and \n\nGondwana, led to the creation of the supercontinent Pangea (Ribeiro, 2013a). The Paleozoic basement \n\nof the Southwest Iberian margin is comprised by deformed and metamorphosed rocks from the South \n\nPortuguese Zone (Ribeiro, 2013a).  \n\n \n\n2.1.2 The Mesozoic Evolution \n\nDuring the Mesozoic, the Southwest Iberian margin suffered continental rifting, oceanic breakup and \n\nsubsequent drifting, associated with the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. The rifting started in the \n\nTriassic, leading to the formation of epicontinental seas during Jurassic and Cretaceous times (Ribeiro, \n\n2013b). This process begun with the thinning of the continental lithosphere, which created graben and \n\nhalf-graben structures with the deposition of evaporites and continental deposits, followed by whole \n\nlithospheric rupture, which accommodated the initial formation of oceanic lithosphere and the formation \n\nand development of a passive margin.  \n\nThe Iberian margin is considered a type of conjugate magma-poor asymmetric rift margin that recorded \n\nthe distinct periods of continental extension (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Tucholke et al., 2007). However, a \n\nconsensus has yet to be reached regarding the number and magnitude of rifting events, their exact age \n\nand more often their regional implications (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Alves et al., 2009).  \n\nIt has been considered that the Iberian margin evolved as a conjugate of the Newfoundland and Nova \n\nScotia margins after four rifting events, namely in the Late Triassic, Early-Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic \n\nand Early Cretaceous (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Alves et al., 2002, 2006, 2009; \n\nFigure 2.3). As a result of the Atlantic tectonic extension, the Southwest Iberian margin was segmented \n\nin distinct structural domains: the inner proximal margin, the outer proximal margin and the distal \n\nmargin (Alves et al., 2009; Pereira and Alves, 2011, 2013; Figure 2.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Line drawings depicting the distinct structural domains of the Southwest Iberian margin (Alves et al., 2013). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n? Rift Phase I \n\nThe first rift phase in the Late Triassic (to earliest Jurassic) was established above a pre-existent \n\nPaleozoic continental crust (Ribeiro et al., 1979). Continental extension begun in the Late Triassic with \n\na wide rift mode in a widespread rift basin between the Labrador and Nova Scotia margin, and from the \n\nsouth (Alentejo) to the north (Galicia) along the margin (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Figure 2.3). Subsidence \n\nand thinning was accommodated in grabens and half?grabens during this period (Stapel et al., 1996), \n\nmarked by the deposition of continental red beds overlain by successions of Hettangian shales and \n\nevaporites (Azer\u00eado et al., 2003). This first phase of extension is synchronous with continental rifting \n\nbetween North Africa and North America (Welsink et al., 1989) and between the Labrador margin and \n\nthe North Sea (Sinclair, 1995). \n\n \n\n? Rift Phase II  \n\nThe second extensional phase is initially marked by magmatic activity from the Rhaetian to the \n\nHettangian. The magmatic activity occurs as dispersed volcano-sedimentary successions throughout the \n\nSouthwest Iberian margin (in Sesimbra, Santiago Cac\u00e9m and Algarve Basin) (Ribeiro et al., 1979; \n\nAzer\u00eado et al., 2003; Martins et al., 2008). These volcano?sedimentary successions have ages and \n\ngeochemical signatures related to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (Martins et al., \n\n2008). \n\nThe second rift phase marks the transition from wide rift to focused extension mode (Tucholke and \n\nSibuet, 2007; Pereira and Alves, 2013), displaying seaward migration of the rift locus and preceding \n\ncontinental breakup (Alves et al., 2009). The Early to Middle Jurassic is described as a period when \n\nWest Iberia and Newfoundland experienced limited epeirogenic subsidence, with minor continental \n\nextension (Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007; Pereira, 2013; Figure 2.3). During this phase the Iberian margin \n\nrecorded a progressive influence of open marine environments with episodes of basin inversion, \n\nobserved on the Toarcian?Aalenian of the Alentejo Basin (Terrinha et al., 2002; Azer\u00eado et al., 2003). \n\nThe southern North Atlantic was segmented during continental extension and subsequent seafloor \n\nspreading (which also affected the offshore Moroccan and Nova Scotia margins), bounded by first?order \n\ntransfer faults that formed correlative geodynamic provinces (Tankard and Balkwill, 1989) (Figure 2.3). \n\nThese transfer zones include the Newfoundland?Gibraltar Transform Zone, the Collector Fault Zone, \n\nthe Avalon Transfer Zone or the Dominion Transfer Zone and the Messejana?Plasencia Fault Zone \n\n(Tankard and Balkwill, 1989; Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007). \n\n \n\n? Rift Phase III  \n\nThe third rifting phase in the Late Jurassic overlays a regional angular unconformity that extends from \n\nthe Callovian to the Mid-Oxfordian (Azer\u00eado et al., 1998, 2002), which shows a new period of intense \n\ntectonic subsidence (Hiscott et al., 1990; Cunha et al., 2009). As a result, West Iberia developed two \n\nmajor N?S to NE?SW rift axes bound by first order transfer zones (the Aveiro Fault, the Nazar\u00e9 Fault, \n\nthe Tagus Fault and the Messejana?Plasencia Fault Zone) (Alves et al., 2009; Figure 2.3). \n\nThe Late Jurassic is characterized by a transition towards seafloor spreading, with increased seaward \n\nthinning of the continental crust, and the main axes of subsidence in the proximal margins of the southern \n\nAlentejo and Lusitanian Basins (Alves et al., 2009). A moderately long phase of extension continued \n\nfrom the Tithonian to the Berriasian?Hauterivian (Tucholke et al., 2007; Bronner et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n? Rift Phase IV  \n\nThe final rifting phase occurred in the Early Cretaceous (Berriasian to Aptian?Albian) (Figure 2.3) and \n\nis mainly observed on the North Iberian margin with a period of tectonic subsidence followed by \n\nformation of oceanic crust (Tucholke et al., 2007). The separation of the continental crust between the \n\nGalicia Bank and North Newfoundland was completed by the Barremian, but continued till the Aptian-\n\nAlbian boundary with the exhumation of mantle, when the oceanic breakup occurred (Tucholke et al., \n\n2007; Figure 2.3). Seafloor spreading off the Southwest Iberian margin occurred by late Aptian-Albian \n\ntimes (Tucholke et al., 2007).  \n\nThe Late Cretaceous is marked by the opening of the Bay of Biscay, which exerted significant rotational \n\ncomponent on the Iberian microplate (Garcia-Mondejar, 1989). During this period, sediment deposition \n\nalong the margin was controlled by thermal subsidence, loading and eustasy.  \n\nThe Late Cretaceous is also marked by magmatic activity, with the intrusion of the alkaline massifs of \n\nMonchique, Sines and Sintra, as well as volcanics, dykes and sills in the Lisboa and Algarve regions \n\n(Miranda et al., 2009, Grange et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Schematic evolution of the North Atlantic, showing the continental breakup from the Upper Jurassic to the Upper \nCretaceous. Modified from Alves et al. (2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n2.1.3 The Cenozoic Evolution \n\n? Alpine Orogeny \n\nThe Southwest Iberian margin is a passive margin since the break-up discontinuity in the Early \n\nCretaceous (Alves et al., 2000, 2003). However, the margin is in close proximity to the plate boundary \n\nbetween Eurasia and Africa, thus affected by the collision and compression events of the Alpine \n\nOrogeny during the Cenozoic (Pyrenean and Betic phases) (Alves et al., 2003, 2006; Pereira and Alves, \n\n2011, 2013).  \n\n \n\n? Tectonic inversion of the Iberian margin \n\nThe Meso-Cenozoic of the West Iberian margin is marked by several periods of tectonic inversion with \n\nancient and recent features (Mougenot et al., 1979; Alves et al., 2003, 2009; Terrinha et al., 2003, 2013b; \n\nZitellini et al., 2004; Neves et al., 2009). The most intensive periods occurred from the latest Cretaceous \n\nonwards, associated with the collision of the Iberian microplate with the Eurasia and Africa plates \n\n(Mougenot et al., 1979). Since the Late Cretaceous, nine tectonic phases of shortening, inversion and \n\nuplift are recorded, according to Alves et al. (2003).  \n\nFrom the Late Cretaceous to the Middle Eocene a significant period of shortening and inversion occurred \n\n(Pinheiro et al., 1996). This period is associated with N-S to NE-SW convergence towards the Pyrenees, \n\nwhen Iberia was connected to North Africa and the active plate boundary was located at the Bay of \n\nBiscay (Mougenot et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1990). During this period, the proximal margin was also \n\ndeformed by the intrusion of the igneous bodies of Sintra, Monchique and Sines (Miranda et al., 2009).  \n\nThe Eocene is characterized by a new episode of inversion widely expressed throughout the Iberian \n\nmargin, caused by a reactivation of the inherited NE-SW rift faults (Mougenot et al., 1979). A relatively \n\nimportant period of inversion occurred from the Late Oligocene to the Miocene, associated with the \n\nNNE-SSW collision between the Iberian microplate and North Africa, during the Atlas phase of the \n\nAlpine Orogeny (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1996). In the Miocene, the Alpine compression is \n\nalso associated with the subduction of the Tethyan oceanic crust in the western Mediterranean and the \n\ncollision between Iberia and North Africa (Figure 2.4). This led to the formation of the Betic-Rif \n\norogenic arc, the submarine accretionary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz and the closure of the gateway \n\nbetween the Tethys and the Atlantic Ocean (Gutscher et al., 2002, 2012; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a; Cunha et \n\nal., 2012; Duarte et al., 2013; Figure 2.4). Inversion and shortening events continued from the Miocene \n\ntill the Present along the Southwest Iberia margin, with the reactivation of the NE-SW to WSW-ENE \n\nextensional faults (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a; Terrinha et al., 2003, 2013b; Zitellini et al., \n\n2004; Neves et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n                                                                                   \n\n            \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Schematic reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of the Southwest Iberian margin and Western Mediterranean, \nfrom the Mesozoic to the Present (Duarte et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n2.2 Stratigraphy of the Southwest Iberian margin \n\nThe sedimentary record of the Southwest Iberian margin spans from Mesozoic to Cenozoic deposits that \n\nlay over the Paleozoic deformed basement. The sedimentary fill recorded the evolution of the Iberian \n\nmargin, from the North Atlantic rifting to the present-day (Hiscott et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1996; \n\nPereira and Alves, 2011, 2013).  \n\nThe lithostratigraphy of the Southwest Iberian margin presented here is based on information gathered \n\nby Pereira (2013), from outcrops in the areas of Sagres, Bordeira, Santiago do Cac\u00e9m and Sines, as well \n\nas the regional stratigraphy and previous seismostratigraphic studies, exploration wells and dredges \n\nsamples analysis (Mougenot et al., 1979; Hiscott et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Pereira and Alves, \n\n2010, 2011, 2013; Figure 2.5 and 2.6).  \n\n \n\n Figure 2.5 \u2013 Lithostratigraphy and seismic stratigraphy of the Southwest Iberian margin with the major tectonic events of the \n\nAlentejo Basin. From Pereira and Alves (2013), based on Alves et al. (2003, 2009), Azer\u00eado et al. (2003) and Rey et al. (2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n2.2.1 The Paleozoic basement \n\nThe Paleozoic units in the Southwest Iberian margin are characterized by moderately to highly deformed \n\nsuccessions of the South Portuguese Zone (Figure 2.6). These successions occur as outcrops in the \n\nSouthwest and in Cercal-Rio Mira (Oliveira, 1984). The Southwest includes, from base to top: the \n\nTercenas Formation, the Carrapateira Group and the Brejeira Formation. The Tercenas Formation is \n\ncharacterized as Late Devonian deep marine shales and sandstones. The Carrapateira Group of the \n\nCarboniferous comprises: \n\n? The Bordalete Formation, composed by metasedimentary black shales and sandstones \n\ninterbedded by siliceous nodules; \n\n? The Murra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation, characterized by silts, limestones and black to red schists and shales; \n\n? The Quebradas Formation, defined by black schists, silts, shales and rare interbedded \n\nlimestones; \n\nThe Brejeira Formation is made of widespread turbidites from the Late Carboniferous. The Cercal-Rio \n\nMoura consists of the Volcanic Complex of Cercal and the Mira Formation. The Volcanic Complex of \n\nCercal was formed since the Late Devonian to the Tournaisian(?). The Mira Formation belongs to the \n\nFlysch do Baixo Alentejo Group and is characterized by turbidites in the Namurian, conglomerates and \n\nsporadic interbedded limestones. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 The Mesozoic deposition \n\nThe Mesozoic deposits of the Southwest Iberian margin, which recorded the syn-rift phases, are initially \n\nrepresented by Late Triassic fluvial red beds with rarer marls and dolomites of the Silves Formation, \n\nabove a regional angular unconformity and the deformed Late Paleozoic (Oliveira, 1984; Ribeiro et al., \n\n1987; Inverno et al., 1993, Azer\u00eado et al., 2003; Figure 2.5). These deposits are observed at the Telheiro \n\nbeach and in Bordeira. The Silves Formation is overlain by the extensive continental Dagorda \n\nFormation, characterized by evaporites, dolomites, marls and shales from the Norian to the Hettangian \n\n(Oliveira, 1984; Ribeiro et al., 1987; Inverno et al., 1993; Azer\u00eado et al., 2003; Figure 2.5 and 2.6).  \n\nThe transition to the second rift phase in the Early Jurassic is marked by the evolution of the Central to \n\nNorth Atlantic, with the setting up of widespread shallow marine conditions and the formation of \n\ncarbonate successions (Azer\u00eado et al., 2003). In the Alentejo Basin, this event is marked by the \n\noccurrence of low energy dolomitic carbonate ramps of the Coimbra Formation (Azer\u00eado et al., 2003; \n\nFigure 2.5). This early inclusion of marine deposits is preceded by the occurrence of magmatic activity \n\nof the CAMP, marking the initiation of an extensional rift phase in the Rhaetian-Hettangian (Martins et \n\nal., 2008). The Southwest Iberian margin in the Pliensbachian is marked by a new period of tectonic \n\nsubsidence (Cunha et al., 2009) with the accumulation of deep-water sediments and marly limestones \n\nin the southern Alentejo Basin, the Forno unit (Oliveira, 1984; Ribeiro et al., 1987). Other areas of the \n\nAlentejo Basin are characterized by dolomites (Inverno et al., 1993).  \n\nThe continuous deepening of the margin associated with a period of tectonic latency, resulted in the \n\nformation of a carbonate ramp along the margin, and by the Toarcian-Aalenian a period of regional \n\nuplift in Southwest Iberia resulted in a hiatus (Ribeiro et al., 1987; Terrinha et al., 2002). Deposition \n\nbegun again in the Bajocian, when the carbonate ramp became shallower and the landward domains \n\nwere uplifted to exposure, which resulted in the extensive unconformity from the Mid-Callovian to the \n\nEarly Oxfordian (Azer\u00eado et al., 1998, 2002, 2003). In Bordeira, the carbonate ramp includes \n\nToarcian(?)-Callovian dolomites (Dolomias Inferiores unit), while in Santiago do Cac\u00e9m the Bathonian-\n\nCallovian was constrained to open shallow marine limestones with marls and dolomites, the Rodeado \n\nand Monte Branco Formations (Inverno et al., 1993). \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe Late Jurassic is marked by a new rift phase and tectonic subsidence in the margin (Mougenot et al., \n\n1979; Hiscott et al., 1990; Cunha et al., 2009). The Late Callovian to Middle Oxfordian interval is \n\ncharacterized by a widespread angular unconformity at the base (Azer\u00eado et al., 1998, 2002). In Santiago \n\ndo Cac\u00e9m the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian is characterized by the Deixa-o-Resto Formation with an \n\nangular unconformity at the base and a succession of polygenic conglomerate and marine limestones \n\nand marls (Inverno et al., 1993). In Bordeira, the basal unit (probably Kimmeridgian) is comprised by \n\nlimestones, dolomites and shales of the Zimbreirinha, overlain by a coral bearing unit (Tr\u00eas Angras \n\nFormation), covered by volcanic tuffs, limestones and conglomerates (Ribeiro et al., 1987).  \n\nIn the Alentejo Basin, the basal Oxfordian units are correlated to the Caba\u00e7os Formation (Figure 2.5), \n\nof lacustrine to shallow marine marls and limestones (Azer\u00eado et al., 2002; Pereira, 2013), while the \n\nOxfordian-Kimmeridgian is characterized by deep-marine to transitional limestones associated with the \n\nperiod of maximum subsidence (Alves et al., 2009). The Late Jurassic deposits in the Alentejo Basin \n\nare characterized by shallow marine sandstones, pelagic limestones and marls (Inverno et al., 1993; \n\nFigure 2.5). The Late Kimmeridgian-Berriasian interval is absent in Santiago do Cac\u00e9m and Bordeira \n\n(Ribeiro et al., 1987; Inverno et al., 1993), however offshore dredges collected shallow marine \n\nlimestones and dolomites, that mark this interval as a major subsidence period (Mougenot et al., 1979). \n\nThe final rift phase is marked by an angular unconformity in the Berriasian, related to a shift in the \n\nnature and architecture of the depositional units and in the locus of active rift subsidence (along the \n\nprincipal N-S axis on the margin) (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Rey et al., 2006; Alves et al., 2009, 2013). In \n\nthe Alentejo Basin this period is absent, but exploration wells in the Southwest Iberian margin revealed \n\nsiliciclastics and carbonates that are roughly correlated to the fluvial-deltaic and shoreline siliciclastics \n\nof the Torres Vedras Formation, north of the Lusitanian Basin, and to the shallow marine limestones of \n\nthe Cascais Formation, south of the Lusitanian Basin (Mougenot et al., 1979; Mougenot, 1989).  \n\nThe Berriasian-Aptian in the Iberian margin is characterized at its top by a widespread unconformity, \n\nthe breakup unconformity (Tucholke et al., 2007). Afterwards, the conjugate Iberia-Newfoundland \n\nmargins evolved as drifting tectonic plates and deposition was mainly controlled by eustasy, periods of \n\npost-rift compression and sediment input into the inherited accommodation space and on the oceanwards \n\ndomains (Mougenot et al., 1979; Alves et al., 2009, 2013; Neves et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010). The \n\nfinal period of the Cretaceous (Campanian) is marked by the occurrence of magmatism with the \n\nintrusions of Monchique, Sines and Sintra (Miranda et al., 2009; Grange et al., 2010).  \n\n \n \n\nPereira (2013) \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Schematic lithostratigraphy, depositional environments and T-R trends from outcrops at Monte Paio, Santiago \n\ndo Cac\u00e9m and Bordeira. From Pereira (2013). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n2.2.3 The Cenozoic deposition \n\nThe Cenozoic in the Alentejo Basin is comprised by Paleogene to Quaternary sediments. These \n\nsediments are sourced by the surroundings areas and by canyon sediment bypass, from the Cenozoic \n\ncontinental depocenters (Oliveira, 1984; Alves et al., 2003). The canyon sediment bypass is related to \n\nthe Lisboa and Set\u00fabal Canyons to the north and the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon to the south, which control \n\nthe sediment input into the margin (Llave et al., 2006; Pereira and Alves, 2010; Valadares, 2012). \n\nThe Paleogene in the offshore is characterized by limestones, dolomites and continental to shallow \n\nmarine siliciclastics assigned to the Benfica and Moreia Formations (Mougenot et al., 1979; Figure 2.6). \n\nThe Eocene is possibly characterized by mass-movement deposits associated with the margin inversion, \n\n(Mougenot et al., 1979), while the Oligocene is marked by a widespread erosion surface, which resulted \n\nfrom tectonic uplift of the margin, and is subsequently covered by fault-bounded successions due to a \n\nrise of sea-level from the Chattian onwards (Alves et al., 2000). \n\nThe Neogene is marked by several phases of inversion from the Burdigalian to the Miocene, with \n\ndeposition of shallow marine siliciclastics. Afterwards, from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene, deep-water \n\nlimestones and marls were deposited above (Mougenot et al., 1979). According to the present \n\nknowledge, the formation of a Contourite Depositional System in the Southwest Iberian margin and \n\nGulf of Cadiz began when the Strait of Gibraltar opened, following the end of Messinian Salinity Crisis \n\n(5.33 to 5.96 Ma; Cita, 2001; Bache et al., 2012). The establishment of this gateway allowed the \n\nexchange between Mediterranean and Atlantic water masses and the formation of a complex drift system \n\non the South and Western Iberian margin (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006; 2015). \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Magmatism \n\nThe West Iberian margin is considered a typical magma-poor rifted margin with distinct and widespread \n\ncycles of magmatic activity throughout the Mesozoic:  \n\n1) The tholeiitic cycle (203-198 Ma), represented by extrusive lava flows in Algarve, Bordeira, \n\nSantiago do Cac\u00e9m and Sesimbra (Martins et al., 2008) and the Messejana-Plasencia doleritic \n\ndyke system (Silva et al., 2008). This is associated with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province \n\n(CAMP) (Verati et al., 2007). \n\n2) The early alkaline cycle (146-142 Ma), represented by the occurrence of alkaline magmatism in \n\nthe center of the Lusitanian Basin (Grange et al., 2008).  \n\n3) The transitional cycle (135-130 Ma), which occurs mainly in the Lusitanian Basin and in \n\nAlgarve, as dykes of dolerites, gabbros and diorites. Minor hypovolcanics also occur in Nazar\u00e9 \n\nand Montejunto (Miranda et al., 2009).  \n\n4) The alkaline cycle (100-71 Ma), which occurred in two pulses: the Foz da Fonte, Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas \n\nand Ribamar as part of the sill and dyke complex of Mafra (100 Ma) (Miranda et al., 2009) and \n\nthe Lisboa Basaltic Complex (73 Ma), intrusive Sines, Sintra and Monchique massifs (84-71 \n\nMa) (Miranda et al., 2009; Grange et al., 2010). \n\nThe first three cycles are associated with the main phases of continental rifting, while the fourth cycle \n\nis associated with the post-rift evolution of the West Iberian margin (Pinheiro et al., 1996).  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\nCONTOURITE DEPOSITS IN THE SEISMIC RECORD \n\n \n\n3.1 Bottom-Currents \n\nBottom-currents can shape the seafloor by eroding, re-suspending and transporting sediments. This type \n\nof current is influenced by several forces that can alter current speed and direction. The erosive, transport \n\nor deposition capacity of bottom-currents varies in time and along their track, forming what is known \n\nas drifts, and particularly contourites (Figure 3.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Diagram of the main bottom-current features and interaction between bottom-currents and local topography. \n\nModified from Stow et al. (2008). \n\n \n\nBottom-current is a generic term that includes different types of currents (Stow et al., 2008; Shanmugam, \n\n2008). Most bottom-currents start as density currents sinking to their buoyancy level. These currents are \n\nmainly unidirectional subsurface currents in contact with the seafloor. They follow a quasi-geostrophic \n\nbalance and a quasi-steady flow that can be affected by tides, seasonal changes or migrating eddies \n\n(Shanmugam, 2008; Zenk, 2008). Thus, their direction is subparallel to the seafloor topography, flowing \n\nalongslope as a single broad core, branding them as \u201ccontour-currents\u201d (Stow et al., 2008; Figure 3.1). \n\nNot all currents are directly involved in contourite formation and a few play only a secondary role. The \n\ndifferent currents involved in contourite construction are described as follows (Shanmugam, 2008): \n\n? Contour-currents: with a net flow alongslope, subparallel to the topographic contours. Despite \n\ntheir path, they can also flow upslope, downslope, around and over topographic obstacles or \n\nirregularities. The Coriolis force and the meridional distribution of continents force the \n\nintensification of these currents along the western and eastern boundaries of the oceans; \n\n? Abyssal currents (also named \u201cocean currents\u201d): characterized as equivalent of large-scale \n\nbottom-currents flowing in the bottom-deep sea, below the edge of the continental slope, with \n\nthe topography and the Coriolis force playing an important role in determining their pathway; \n\n\n\n16 \n\n? Thermohaline currents: formed as a result of uneven density distributions and variable \n\ntemperature and salt content in the water masses. The horizontal transport of a water mass \n\ndetermines the oceanic conveyor-belt, called the Meridional Overturning Circulation on the \n\nAtlantic Ocean (AMOC) (Figure 3.2); \n\n? Geostrophic currents: characterized by long-lasting equilibrium conditions between the \n\nhorizontal pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. The flow is forced to follow the bathymetric \n\ncontours, since these currents have zero vertical velocity; \n\n? Deep-water currents: formed by deep-water tidal currents in submarine canyons, long-wave \n\nbaroclinic currents (internal waves, tides, solitary waves) and tsunami-related traction currents. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Representation of the global oceanic conveyor-belt and the so called Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation \n\n(Rahmstorf, 2002, 2006). \n\n \n\nTwo other processes occur interstratified with the processes involved in contourite formation, although \n\nthey are not related to the construction of contourites: \n\n? Upwelling: which involves the rise of deep-water masses, and produces bottom-currents against \n\ntopographic barriers and continental margins, mainly at low latitudes; \n\n? Downwelling: characterized by a downward transport of cooled water masses from the surface. \n\nThis transport occurs mainly at polar latitudes, resulting in bottom-currents (not necessarily at \n\nthe ocean margins, therefore it does not affect the seafloor sometimes).  \n\n \n\n3.2 Contourites \n\nContourites are sediments deposited on continental margins or ocean basins, due to the effect of bottom-\n\ncurrents and several processes (such as tides, internal waves, barotropic waves, dynamic instabilities \n\nand gravitational flux) on the seafloor (Stow et al., 2002b; Rebesco, 2005; Faug\u00e8res and Stow, 2008). \n\nContourite deposition often involves multi-phase entrainment, long distance transport, and interaction \n\namong depositional processes induced by the various types of bottom-current (McCave, 2008; Stow et \n\nal., 2008). Yet, the different types of bottom-currents are known to influence to a greater or lesser extent \n\nmany depositional environments. They affect various types of sediment, both during and after \n\ndeposition. Thus, it is generally accepted that contourite sedimentary facies also include sediments, \n\nSurface Flow \nDeep Flow \nBottom Flow \n\nSalinity > 36 %o  \nSalinity &lt;34 %o  \nDeep Water Formation \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nusually interbedded, that are not deposited under the influence of bottom-currents (Figure 3.3). The \n\noccurrence of sediments other than contourites is due to the interaction between alongslope, downslope \n\nand pelagic processes. Turbidites, for example, can occur frequently within contourite successions, even \n\nif the bottom-current influence is large enough to control the overall geometry of the deposits and \n\ngenerate a contourite drift (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999; Rebesco, 2005; Rebesco et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Examples of other sediment facies interbedded with contourite facies at Expedition 339 Sites U1386 and U1387 \n\nin the Faro Drift, Algarve Basin (adapted from Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a, 2015). \n\n \n\nBottom-currents are capable of building thick and extensive accumulations of sediments, if a significant \n\nsediment input is available, from the abyssal floor to the outer shelf (Faug\u00e8res and Stow, 2008). The \n\nterm contourite drifts should be used for sediment accumulations deposited, or significantly affected, by \n\ncurrents flowing along the contours. However, it was highlighted already that different types of bottom-\n\ncurrent exist and therefore, the term contourite drifts should be used for sediment accumulations \n\ndeposited by bottom-currents in general. \n\nS\n (\n\nT\nW\n\nT\n) \n\nNW / SE    WSW / ENE \nLine PD00-830                  Line PD00-706 \n\n\n\n18 \n\n3.3 Depositional and erosional features related to bottom-currents \n\nThe formation of contourites along any continental margin involves the construction of several erosional \n\nand depositional features. When alongslope processes dominate over other processes, such as mass \n\nwasting, turbidity currents or pelagic settling, erosional and depositional features are formed as a result \n\nof bottom-current variations (Figure 3.4 and 3.5) and are usually linked to a Contourite Depositional \n\nSystem (CDS). If this CDS is distinct but connected within the same water mass, it can be considered a \n\nContourite Depositional Complex (CDC) (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006). The formation of a \n\nCDS ends when the transport capacity of the bottom-current diminishes till it no longer dominates over \n\nother depositional processes. Therefore, mixing with other deep-water facies types occurs, with the \n\nformation of erosional and depositional features at different scales, from small crossbed layers to large \n\nsediment drifts (Rebesco, 2005; Rebesco et al., 2014).  \n\nIn the seismic record, contourites are easy to recognize due to unambiguous diagnostic criteria at the \n\nmesoscale. The classification of contourite drifts, established by Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999) and Rebesco et \n\nal. (2014), focuses on the definition of different drift types by location, morphology and drift \n\ndevelopment for each geological and hydrological context. These classifications are not mutually \n\nexclusive, due to gradation and overlap between all types and mixed drifts (Figure 3.5 and 3.6). Most \n\ndrifts have sheeted or mounded morphology, but the mounded forms are also further classified based on \n\nother physiographic features (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999). Large-scale surface and linear erosional features \n\nare also common, usually associated with contourite deposits. Surface features are reported as terraces \n\nor abraded surfaces, while linear features are channels, moats or marginal valleys (Figure 3.4 and 3.6). \n\n \n\nCONTOURITE CHANNEL \n\n \n\nCONTOURITE MOAT \n\n \n\nMARGINAL VALLEY \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Main characteristics of linear large-scale contourite erosional features Rebesco et al.

However, contourite \n\nfeatures have also been described in the Mediterranean, Indian, Pacific, Arctic and Antarctic basins in \n\ndifferent settings and associated with either deep-intermediate or shallow water masses (Faug\u00e8res et al., \n\n1999; Rebesco et al., 2014; Figure 3.8).  \n\nWhile their identification in the offshore has been rather successful, the detection of contourite deposits \n\nin the onshore sedimentary record is extremely difficult since it is not possible to identify their overall \n\nmorphology. Their identification in the onshore geological record is also obscured by the occurrence of \n\ngeological processes such as bioturbation, sedimentation, erosion, compaction, tectonics and \n\nmetamorphosing (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014). The identification of \n\ncontourite outcrops needs to consider the context behind their formation, associated with the \n\npaleogeographic and tectonic frameworks. The most ancient records of contourites come from the \n\nCambro-Ordovician to the Neogene (Figure 3.7), trending in an east-westward tendency across the \n\nglobe, associated with the evolution of the Paleo Tethys Ocean (Huneke and Stow, 2008; Rebesco et \n\nal., 2014; Figure 3.8). \n\nA1 \n\n A2 \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Ancient contourite outcrops of the Lefkara Formation, Cyprus (Paleogene to Early Neogene).

From Rebesco et al. (2014). \n\n \n\n3.5 Contourite Drifts: Economic and Oceanographic Relevance \n\nContourites have been given growing attention in three main research areas, paleoceanography and \n\npaleoclimatology, hydrocarbon exploration and slope stability.  \n\nThe academy is by far the field that has given greater interest and contributions to the study of \n\ncontourites. Contourites were usually confined to more academic studies in the past, since they were \n\nrarely associated with hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs and most of the hydrocarbon reserves found in \n\ndeep-waters were related to turbidite reservoirs (e.g. Viana et al., 2007; Viana and Rebesco, 2007; \n\nViana, 2008).  In more recent years, the number of contourite systems identified in deep-water settings \n\n\n\n22 \n\nhas increased, (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1993; Rebesco et al., 2014) and sandy contourites have been discovered \n\nduring IODP Expedition 339 in 2011-2012 (Brackenridge, 2014; Stow et al., 2014), which shows their \n\npotential to act as reservoirs and seals. As a result, the economic value of contourites increased and the \n\npetroleum industry started to invest in the research of contourites (Rebesco, 2005; Shanmugam, 2006; \n\nStow et al., 2013; Brackenridge et al., 2013). The economic interest in contourites has gradually \n\nincreased thanks to the academic research and the need to investigate hydrocarbon reservoirs other than \n\nthe classic turbidites (Viana et al., 2007; Rebesco et al., 2014).  \n\nIn parallel with the petroleum industry uses, two other main research areas are depicted as having \n\nconsiderable importance: paleoceanography-paleoclimatology and slope stability. The \n\npaleoceanographic record, driven by climate changes, can be studied through contourite deposits \n\n(Faug\u00e8res et al., 1993; Rebesco et al., 2014). The sedimentary stacking pattern of contourite drifts \n\nchange due to important paleoceanographic, climatic or sea-level fluctuations, which affect sediment \n\ninflux and deposition. Therefore, their stacking pattern can be used to identify phases and modifications \n\nof oceanic current activity, as well as the factors that induce local- and global-scale variations in \n\nthermohaline circulation, fundamental to understanding climate changes (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999; Rebesco \n\net al., 2014). \n\nThe analysis of slope stability in areas affected by contour-currents and contourite deposition is another \n\nimportant aspect to study (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). Vigorous contour-currents can locally \n\nerode the seafloor, provoking sediment instability and triggering potentially hazardous mass-flow events \n\n(Mulder et al., 2003; Laberg et al., 2005; Viana et al., 2007). Several studies have shown that contourites \n\nact as a predispositioning factor for slope instability. For example, the development of the Storegga \n\nSlide in Norway. The Storegga slide corresponds to a collapse of ~290 km along the Norwegian margin \n\non an area of ~3500 km3 (Bondevik et al., 2012). This event was triggered in the Holocene by seismic \n\nactivity or methane hydrates dissociation (B\u00fcnz et al., 2003; Lisa, 2014). However, it was also shown \n\nthat contourites with high mud content, plasticity and water content worked as weak layers for shear \n\nstress movements and predisposed the occurrence of the Storegga slide (Bryn et al., 2005).   \n\n\n\n23 \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\nCONTOURITES IN IBERIA \n\n \n\n4.1 Oceanography of SW Iberia  \n\nThe present oceanic circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz is motivated by the exchange system established \n\nbetween the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar (Baringer and \n\nPrice, 1999). This gateway allows the exchange between the warm saline Mediterranean Outflow Water \n\n(MOW) and the overlying Atlantic Inflow Water (AIW) (Ambar et al., 2002; Serra et al., 2005).  \n\nThe AIW is a 0-500 m layer formed by the North Atlantic Surface Water (NASW), which flows from \n\nthe surface to approximately 100 m depth with temperatures above 16\u00baC and salinity of 36.40\u2030, and by \n\nthe North Atlantic Central Water (NACW), which flows between 100 and 700 m depth with \n\ntemperatures of 11-17\u00baC and salinity of 35.6-36.5\u2030 (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). The NASW has \n\nits origin in shallow NACW that was modified by air-sea interactions (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). \n\nThe NACW is comprised by two distinct layers: the northward upper layer of sub-tropical origin \n\n(NACWt) at >45\u00baN (with 12.2-18.5\u00baC and 35.66-36.75\u2030) and the southward lower sub-polar layer \n\n(NACWp), which prevails up to 35\u00baN (with 4-12\u00baC and 34.96-35.66\u2030) (P\u00e9rez et al., 1993; Fi\u00faza et al., \n\n1998; Mason et al., 2006; Padin et al., 2011). Over the continental shelf of the Gulf of Cadiz, warmer \n\nand fresher Shelf Waters (SW) have been detected at the surface with temperatures of 14-18\u00baC and \n\nsalinity of 35.9-36.5\u2030 (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). \n\nThe Mediterranean Water is originated in the Mediterranean Sea as a result of higher evaporation than \n\nprecipitation and runoff, consisting of the mixture of two water masses from the Mediterranean Basin, \n\nthe Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) and a small component of the Western Mediterranean Deep \n\nWater (WMDW). The constricted basin and arid climate provides the necessary conditions for the \n\nformation of warm, dense saline water of 13\u00baC and 36.5\u2030 (Ambar and Howe, 1979). The WMDW is \n\nformed in the Gulf of Lion, filling the Mediterranean Basin below 500 m water depth, and flows around \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, before exiting by the Alboran Sea and through the Strait \n\nof Gibraltar. The LIW is formed in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, and flows between 150 and 500 m \n\nwater depth, over the upper and mid-continental slopes, through the Sicilian Strait, towards the Alboran \n\nSea and Strait of Gibraltar (Millot 1999, 2009).  \n\nThe MOW is restricted to a core approximately 10 km wide as it passes through the Strait of Gibraltar \n\n(Ambar and Howe, 1979). The MOW accelerates through the Strait of Gibraltar (reaching velocities up \n\nto 250 cm s-1) as a warm (13\u00baC) and dense (37\u2030) water mass and forms a turbulent gravity driven flow \n\nbefore sinking downslope towards northwest (Ambar and Howe, 1979; Mulder et al., 2003; Garc\u00eda et \n\nal., 2009; Figure 4.1). The MOW sinks as a result of its high salinity and the seafloor morphology at the \n\nexit of the Strait of Gibraltar. In the Gulf of Cadiz, the MOW begins to raft above the NADW and \n\ndeflects northward due to the Coriolis force (Zenk 1970, 1975; Baringer and Price, 1997; Ambar et al., \n\n1999). The MOW can exceed 80 km in width and forms a broad water mass along the continental slope, \n\nwith lower velocities of 80-40 cm s-1 towards northwest (Baringer and Price, 1997). The MOW\u2019s reaches \n\nits lowest velocity (about 10 cm s-1) on the South Iberian margin (Ambar and Howe, 1979) due to diapiric \n\nridges oblique to its flow direction (Nelson et al., 1993). Eventually, it settles as an intermediate contour-\n\ncurrent offshore the Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, between 400 and 1400 m water depth.  \n\n\n\n24 \n\nThe MOW\u2019s main water core is separated into two major cores and two minor ones (westwards of 6\u00ba20\u2019 \n\n\u2013 7\u00ba W), which flow at different depths with distinct oceanographic properties (Zenk 1970; Ambar and \n\nHowe, 1979; Ambar et al., 2002). The two major cores are the Mediterranean Upper Water (MU) and \n\nthe Mediterranean Lower Water (ML), and the minor cores are the Shallow Core and the Deep Core \n\n(Zenk 1970; Ambar and Howe 1979; Ambar et al., 2002, 2008; Figure 4.1). The MU is a warmer and \n\nmore saline water (13\u201314\u00baC and 35.7-37\u2030) than the ML (10.5\u201311.5\u00b0C and 36.5\u201337.5\u2030) and flows \n\nnorthward, along the continental slope of southwest Iberia, between 600 and 1000 m depth, but centered \n\nat 700-800 m depth. The ML flows northwest between 1000 and 1300 m depth, stabilizing around 1200-\n\n1300 m depth with 20-30 cm s-1 velocity average (Bower et al., 2002; Llave et al., 2007b). At 7\u00baW, a \n\nbranch detaches from the southern part of the ML to veer off towards southwest. At 7\u00ba 20\u2019W, the ML is \n\ndivided into three distinct branches: the Southern Branch (SB), the Principal Branch (PB) and the \n\nIntermediate Branch (IB). They flow in a general northwestern direction and join around 8\u00ba 20\u2019W (Llave \n\net al., 2007b; Garc\u00eda et al., 2009; Figure 4.1). \n\nThe Shallow Core flows between 400 and 600 m depth along the continental slope of southwest Iberia, \n\nand possesses higher temperatures than the Deep Core (Ambar et al., 2002, 2008). The Deep Core is \n\nrecognized from the Portim\u00e3o Canyon to Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, between 1300 and 1600 m depth (Ambar \n\net al., 2002, 2008; Bower et al., 2002). The Deep Core branch is detached from the ML in association \n\nwith pulses of dense water, forced to descend to greater depths due to interaction with the canyon \n\ntopography (Bower et al., 2002; Ambar et al., 2008). Both the Portim\u00e3o Canyon and Cape S\u00e3o Vicente \n\nact as a source of meddies formation. The Portim\u00e3o Canyon is a source of meddies detached from the \n\nDeep Core and found downstream from the canyon, while Cape S\u00e3o Vicente is a source of meddies \n\ndetached from the ML (Ambar et al., 2002, 2008; Serra et al., 2005). \n\nUnderneath the MOW, the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) from the Greenland-Norwegian Sea \n\nflows southward at depths >1500 m. This water is characterized as a cold (3\u00ba-8\u00baC) and less saline (34.95\u2013\n\n35.20\u2030) water mass (Reid, 1979). In the Gulf of Cadiz, the NADW is joined by part of the MOW, \n\nflowing southwards down the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean (Reid, 1979). \n\n  \nFigure 4.1. \u2013 Main water masses flowing around the Iberian Peninsula (Stow et al., 2013). \n\nNASW: North Atlantic Superficial  \nWater \nNADW: North Atlantic Deep  \nWater \nAIW: Atlantic Inflow Water \n\nMOW: Mediterranean Outflow \nWater \nMU: Mediterranean Upper Water \nML: Mediterranean Lower Water \n SB: Southern Branch \n PB: Principal Branch \n IB: Intermediate Branch \n\n\n\n25 \n\n4.1.1 Pliocene-Quaternary Paleoceanography of the MOW \n\nWhile present-day MOW circulation is well constrained, the paleoceanography of the MOW is still \n\npoorly known. The interaction between the MOW and the Atlantic Ocean is marked by the Messinian \n\nSalinity Crisis, an event during which the Mediterranean Sea underwent desiccation. Data from the \n\nMediterranean Basin pinpoints the Messinian Salinity Crisis between 5.96 and 5.33 Ma (Cita, 2001; \n\nBache et al., 2012). The occurrence of the Messinian Salinity Crisis in the Miocene is associated with \n\nseveral events of tectonic activity and sea-level and climatic fluctuations, which led to the closure of the \n\nStrait of Gibraltar and the isolation of the Mediterranean Basin in multiple stages (Bache et al., 2012). \n\nThe Messinian Salinity Crisis ended with the Zanclean flood, which signified the beginning of water \n\nmasses exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009). Several \n\nauthors also suggest water formation in the Mediterranean Basin after an influx of Atlantic water into \n\nthe basin, around the Early to Mid-Pliocene (Hs\u00fc et al., 1973; Llave et al., 2011; Bache et al., 2012).  \n\nThe circulation of the MOW through the Pliocene and Quaternary, and its relation to past climatic \n\nconditions, was studied through several methods, previously mentioned in Chapter 1. With the \n\nestablishment of the MOW circulation in the Early Pliocene, climatic fluctuations influence and cause \n\nvariations. Climatic fluctuations are responsible for the formation of two periods of cooler, saltier and \n\nmore oxygenated Mediterranean deep water, with an enhanced circulation regime: the first period at, \n\n3.4-3.0 Ma, occurred moderately close to the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations (3.1-2.7 Ma) \n\n(Hayward et al., 2009; Kh\u00e9lifi et al., 2009); and the second period, at 1.3-1.0 Ma, corresponds to the \n\nMid-Pleistocene Transition (1.2-0.55 Ma) (Hayward et al., 2009).  These variations are characterized \n\nby MOW enhancement during glacial times, with a saltier, denser and more vigorous lower branch of \n\nthe MOW (Cacho et al., 2000, 2002; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006; Rogerson et al., 2005; Llave \n\net al., 2006; Voelker et al., 2006; Toucanne et al., 2007; Garc\u00eda et al., 2009; Kaboth et al., 2016). While \n\nduring the interglacials, a weaker MOW was split into several branches (Stow et al., 2002c). A few \n\nauthors also propose highly dynamic outflow waters, with up and downslope movements on numerous \n\ntimescales, in response to the density contrasts between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean water masses \n\nand their relation to climatic changes (Rogerson et al., 2005, 2012).  \n\n \n\n4.2 Contourites in the Iberian margin \n\nThe MOW has affected the Iberian margin since the Late Miocene and its interaction with the seafloor \n\ndeveloped erosional and depositional features. This current has affected the sediments deposited in this \n\nregion and lead to the formation of variable drifts from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Northwest Iberian \n\nmargin (the Albufeira, Bartolomeus Dias, Faro, Guadalquivir, Huelvas, Lagos, Portim\u00e3o and Sagres \n\ndrifts; in the Camarinal and Spartel sills and around the Galicia Bank; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; \n\nLlave et al., 2001, 2006, 2007, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, 2011, 2015; Roque et al., \n\n2012; Figure 4.2). Therefore, this complex sedimentary system is referred to as the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nContourite Depositional System (GCCDS) (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006).  \n\nThe occurrence of contourite deposits in the West Portuguese margin is scarce and poorly characterized, \n\nwith a few examples identified near structural highs and geomorphologic irregularities (Alves et al., \n\n2003; Badagola, 2008). Their development is associated with the circulation of the MOW or the deeper \n\nNADW (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011). The Sines Drift is one of the main features of the GCCDS in \n\nthe Southwest Portuguese margin, firstly identified by its general plastered morphology and stratified \n\nacoustic character (Mougenot, 1989; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015). Moreover, Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et \n\nal. (2011) has made a numeric simulation of bottom-current velocities (at regional scale) to detect \n\n\n\n26 \n\npotential zones for drift formation in the West Portuguese margin. The results include the Extremadura \n\nSpur, off Porto at the continental slope and off Aveiro at the continental rise (Figure 4.2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Examples of contourite drifts identified from the Galicia Bank (1) to the Western Iberian margin (2) and the Strait \n\nof Gibraltar (3). Modified from Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2011), with seismic profiles from Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2011) \nand Alves et al. (2003). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contourite Depositional System of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nThe GCCDS is well characterized in the South Iberia margin (Figure 4.3). Many authors have studied \n\nits erosional and depositional features (e.g. Gonthier et al., 1984; Nelson et al., 1993, 1999; Llave et al., \n\n2001, 2006, 2007b, 2011, 2015; Stow et al., 2002c, 2013; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, 2006, 2014a,b, \n\n2015; Mulder et al., 2003, 2006; Roque et al., 2012; Brackenridge et al., 2013). The features in the \n\neastern Gulf of Cadiz are associated with the erosive capacity of the bottom water mass and its \n\ninteraction with local seafloor morphology. In this area, laterally extensive abraded surfaces are moving \n\nto discrete contourite channels, where diapiric structures control bottom-current flow. The northern Gulf \n\nof Cadiz is linked with contourite moats and large-scale depositional features (Figure 4.3). Depositional \n\nfeatures, such as contourites, also occur along the Iberian margin. These features have distinct but similar \n\ncharacteristics, related to the decrease in transport capacity of the MOW and the increasing distance \n\nfrom the Strait of Gibraltar (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006, 2015).  \n\nThe main depositional features in the GCCDS are sediment wave fields, sediment lobes, mixed drifts, \n\nplastered drifts, elongated mounded and separate drifts and sheeted drifts. The main erosional features \n\nidentified are contourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys and moats. Their characteristics and \n\ndistribution along the margin define five morphosedimentary sectors (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006; \n\nFigure 4.3): 1) proximal scours and ribbons sector; 2) overflow sedimentary lobes sector; 3) channels \n\nand ridges sector; 4) contourite drifts sector; 5) submarine canyons sector. The main characteristics of \n\neach sector are reviewed herein.  \n\n2.5 km     \n\nSines Drift \nW          E \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\n3 \n\n1s \n \n \n \n \n2s \n\n \n\nT\nW\n\nT\n \n\nAreas with dominant along-slope (contourite) processes \nand identified contourite depositional system \n\n15\u00b0 W            10\u00b0 W       5\u00b0 W        \n\n \n\n40\u00b0N \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n35\u00b0N \n\n 3 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\nAFRICA \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 GCCDS sectors differentiated by large-scale erosional and depositional features (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006). \n \n\nSector 1: Proximal scours and ribbons sector  \n\nThe sector 1 of the GCCDS is located near the Strait of Gibraltar. It is characterized by high energy \n\nbottom-currents (Kenyon and Belderson, 1973) and gravity-driven overflow features (Mulder et al., \n\n2003). The turbulent and gravity-driven cascade of the MOW over the Camarinal Sill, which is the sill \n\nthat separates the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, led to the formation of two deep erosional \n\nchannels and outcrop features (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014b; Figure 4.4). Recent campaigns have \n\nidentified additional drift features, with plastered drifts along the upper slope and two mounded drifts \n\non two broad erosional terraces (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014b, 2015). These terraces form a major \n\nabraded surface, from 500 to 800 m water depths, dominated by erosional processes (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina \n\net al., 2014b). \n\nCloser to the Strait of Gibraltar, the region is characterized by rock outcrops on the seafloor and coarse \n\ngrained sediments (Mulder et al., 2003). These features suggest a highly vigorous current regime along \n\nthe route of the MOW proximal to the Strait of Gibraltar. Although, there are depositional features in \n\nthis sector, which suggest a reduction in MOW velocity (and sediment transport capacity) away from \n\nthe Strait of Gibraltar towards northwest and laterally from the MOW\u2019s core to the east and west (Mulder \n\net al., 2003). Gravel and sand lag deposits give way to sand ribbons and wave deposits (Mulder et al., \n\n2003). The orientation of all features follow the route of the MOW alongslope, as it leaves the Strait of \n\nGibraltar towards west and bends northward due to the Coriolis force.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Swath bathymetry with the location of the main depositional and erosional features at the exit of the Strait of \n\nGibraltar (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014b). \n\n \n\nSector 2: Overflow sedimentary lobes sector  \n\nSector 2, characterized by overflow sedimentary lobes, is located downslope and seaward of the first \n\nsector, between 800 and 1600 m water depth. This sector is characterized by sand-rich contourite \n\ndeposits, with sedimentary wave fields, downslope orientated channels, furrow erosive features and \n\nassociated depositional lobes (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006, 2014b; Hanquiez et al., 2010). The main \n\ndepositional feature is a large contourite drift, located near the border with Sector 1. This large contourite \n\nis topped by an extensive sediment wave field (Figure 4.5). These sediment wave fields are incised by \n\na series of downslope orientated channels and furrows. The largest channel is the Gil Eanes Channel, \n\nwith an extension of 40 km and a reach of 1200 m water depth (Nelson et al., 1993). The Gil Eanes \n\nChannel and two major channels are U-shaped in cross section, with bioclastic sands in their axes and \n\nsediment lobe deposits at their terminus. These lobe deposits are thought to be formed by incision and \n\ninduced gravity processes, related to a periodic deepening of the MOW (Rogerson et al., 2012). Other \n\nfeatures in this sector include mud volcanoes, topographic highs on the seafloor that can redirect \n\nchannels and that have important roles as conduits for gas migration (Hanquiez et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 High-resolution bathymetry of the Aveiro channel-lobe depositional system located in sector 2 of the \n\nGCCDS (Hanquiez et al., 2010). \n\n\n\n29 \n\nSector 3: Channels and ridges sector \n\nThe channels and ridges sector is located northwest of the first sector. This sector is characterized by \n\ndiapiric ridges orientated NE-SW, perpendicular to the MOW flow, and tectonic basement highs. The \n\ninteraction between the MOW\u2019s branches with the seafloor creates the distinct channels in this sector \n\n(Nelson et al., 1993, 1999). This also provokes a morphological enhancement of the MOW branches, \n\nwhich leads to a higher erosional capacity. The major channels are named from the upper continental \n\nslope seaward: Gusano, Huelva, Diego Cao, Guadalquivir and Cadiz channels, with lengths over 100 \n\nkm (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006; Stow et al., 2013; Figure 4.6). Unlike the channels and furrows in \n\nSector 2, these contourite channels tend to be sinuous and asymmetrical in cross section (Stow et al., \n\n2013). The channels incise the upper slope sheeted drifts, mid-slope deformed sheeted and buried \n\nmounded drifts (Llave et al., 2007a; Figure 4.6). \n\n \nFigure 4.6 - Three-dimensional model from swath bathymetry with the main erosional features (contourite channels and \n\nfurrows) and diapiric ridges of the Gulf of Cadiz (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003). \n\n \n\nSector 4: Contourite drifts sector \n\nThe contourite drifts sector is located in the West and South Iberian continental margin. The fourth \n\nsector has been recognized by the occurrence of contourite drifts (Mougenot and Vanney, 1982; \n\nFaug\u00e8res et al., 1984; Gonthier et al., 1984). This sector is characterized by high sediment thickness, \n\nand hence shows a clear record of the influence of the MOW in the North Atlantic Ocean (Llave et al., \n\n2001, 2010, 2015; Roque et al., 2012; Stow et al., 2013; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014b, 2015).  \n\nThe largest feature in this sector is the Faro-Albufeira elongated mounded drifts, and the related Alvares-\n\nCabral contourite moat, which separates these features from the continental slope and funnels the MOW \n\nwestward (Figure 4.7). These drifts show upslope progradation patterns and laterally extensive erosional \n\ndiscontinuities, which can be linked with fluctuations in the intensity of the MOW (Llave et al., 2001; \n\nRoque et al., 2012). Downslope, associated with the Faro-Albufeira elongated mounded drifts, are a set \n\nof aggradational sheeted contourite drifts: the Faro-Cadiz and the Bartolomeu Dias drifts (Hern\u00e1ndez-\n\nMolina et al., 2006; Llave et al., 2011; Roque et al., 2012). \n\n(m) \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Bathymetric map and seismic profile with interpretation of the main depositional (Faro mounded drift) and \n\nerosional (Alvares-Cabral moat) features in the South Iberian margin. Modified from Roque et al. (2012).  \n\n \n\nSector 5: Submarine canyons sector \n\nThe submarine canyons sector is the western most sector of the GCCDS, mainly dominated by \n\ndownslope erosive features and muddy plastered and sheeted contourite drifts (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n\n2006; Roque et al., 2012; Figure 4.8). The largest feature in this sector is the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon, \n\norientated downslope (NE-SW), although other canyons also form significant features on the sea bed, \n\nthe Portim\u00e3o, the Lagos and Sagres canyons (Llave et al., 2001; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015). These \n\ncanyons are surrounded by the Lagos, Portim\u00e3o and Sagres sheeted drifts. These drifts are characterized \n\nby muddy sediments interbedded with sand-rich downslope deposits (Llave et al., 2001).  \n\nThis sector differs from Sector 4 due to the capture of the MOW as it flows over the Portim\u00e3o Canyon. \n\nThis implicates a reduction in bottom-current velocity and a decrease in average grain size across the \n\ncanyon (Mulder et al., 2006; March\u00e8s et al., 2010). This reduction has important implications for the \n\ncontrols on contourite sand and mud deposition and downslope/alongslope process interaction. \n\nAfterwards, the MOW flows towards southwest or turns north and flows along the West and \n\nNorthwestern Iberian margin (Zenk 1970, 1975; Baringer and Price, 1997; Ambar et al., 1999). In the \n\nnorth, the MOW flows along the seafloor, leading to the formation of contourite drifts on the Galician \n\nand Cantabrian continental margins (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Seismic profile with interpretation of the Lagos and Sagres drifts, separated from the S\u00e3o Vicente High by moats \n\nand bound by the Lagos Canyon (LC) and S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon (SVC), respectively (Roque et al., 2012).  \n\nPortugal \n\n\n\n31 \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\nDATA &amp; METHODOLOGY \n\n \n\n5.1 Dataset \n\nThe dataset used in this work consists of: i) unpublished seismic reflection profiles acquired in 2014 in \n\nthe scope of the MOWER/CONDRIBER project, ii) seismic reflection profiles acquired in other \n\nacademic surveys (BIGSETS, STEAM) and oil-industry survey (GSI), iii) downhole logging data \n\nacquired during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 339 at Site U1391, iv) \n\nlithological, chronological and physical properties data from this Site, v) stratigraphic and logging data \n\nfrom Pescada-1 oil-well, and vi) SWIM multibeam bathymetry (Zitellini et al., 2009; Figure 5.1). \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Seismic reflection data \n\nThe seismic reflection profiles used in this work were obtained either during several academic cruises, \n\nnamely MOWER/CONDRIBER, STEAM 94 and BIGSETS 98, or in oil-industry surveys as GSI 84 \n\n(Figure 5.1).

Three holes were drilled at Site U1391: U1391A, U1391B \n\nand U1391C. The Site penetrated 671.5 mbsf (meters below seafloor), beneath 1073.7 m of water depth \n\nand cored a total of 1378.1 m with a recovery of 958.57 m, which corresponds to 92.3% (Table 5.3). \n\nDuring IODP Expedition 339, several analyses were carried on-board and downhole, including detailed \n\nvisual assessment, smear slide analysis, sediment samples, physical properties and downhole logging \n\nmeasurements.  \n\nIn the present work, downhole logging measurements, physical properties and grain size data from Site \n\nU1391 were used to provide information about the lithostratigraphy, the chronostratigraphy and the \n\n\n\n33 \n\npetrophysical properties of the drilled sediments. IODP Expedition 339 core datasets are available at \n\nIODP\u2019s online database: http://iodp.tamu.edu/index.html. The tools and methods used during \n\nExpedition 339 to acquire the core data are reviewed herein. \n\nHigh-resolution non-destructive measurements of physical properties of sediments at Site U1391 \n\ninclude gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, P-wave velocity and magnetic susceptibility in 2.5 \n\ncm steps on the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL). Natural gamma ray (NGR) was measured \n\non whole-round core sections at 10 and 20 cm spacing. Also, discrete P-wave velocities were measured \n\non working-half sections and in Hole U1391A on every other section. However, the measurements were \n\nonly considered viable for the upper 50 mbsf. Moisture and density (MAD) samples were obtained for \n\nevery other section of each core in Holes U1391A and U1391C. Finally, color reflectance spectrometry \n\nand split-core pointlogger magnetic susceptibility were obtained for every section of each hole in 5 cm \n\nsteps (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012). \n\nThe downhole logging measurements had to account for the placement of the pipe (the so called \n\n\u201cbaseline\u201d) at 98.9 mbsf. The logging operations deployed two tool strings, the triple combination and \n\nthe Formation MicroScanner Sonde (FMS). These tool strings also included Hostile Environment \n\nNatural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) and Hostile \n\nEnvironment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). The tool string reached the bottom of the hole at 671.5 mbsf \n\nand logging was made with multiple passes up to the seafloor. \n\n \n\nTable 5.3 \u2013 Coring summary of the three drilled holes at IODP Site U1391: U1391A, U1391B and U1391C (extracted from \n\nExpedition 339 Scientists, 2012). \n\nCoring Summary Hole U1391A Hole U1391B Hole U1391C \n\nLongitude 9\u00ba24.6601?W 9\u00ba24.6604?W 9\u00ba24.6468?W \n\nLatitude 37\u00ba21.5392?N 37\u00ba21.5288?N 37\u00ba21.5286?N \n\nWater depth (m) 1073.7 1073.3 1073.3 \n\nTotal penetration (mbsf) 353.1 353.5 671.5 \n\nTotal length of cored section (m) 353.1 353.5 331.5 \n\nTotal core recovered (m) 342.62 346.93 269.02 \n\nCore recovery (%) 97.03 98.14 81.15 \n\n \n\n5.2 Methodology \n\n5.2.1 General concepts of seismic reflection  \n\nSeismic reflection is a geophysical method capable of obtaining data and acoustic 2D images of the \n\ngeology under the seafloor. This method is based on the generation and detection of acoustic waves, \n\nwhich propagate through different geological layers. The process begins with the generation of a short \n\npulse of sound (shot) from a source, for example an airgun. The released energy generates acoustic \n\nwaves that travel through the water and rock layers. The acoustic waves will be reflected on different \n\ninterfaces, due to acoustic impedance contrasts (Yilmaz, 1987; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995): \n\n? = ? \u00d7?    Equation 1 \n\nWhere I represents the acoustic impedance, ? the density (g/cm3) and V the velocity (m/s).  \n\nhttp://iodp.tamu.edu/index.html\n\n\n34 \n\nSubsequently, the reflected waves will be recorded at the surface by seismic receivers, for example \n\nhydrophones in the offshore acquisition (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Figure 5.2). The records will be \n\nprocessed and transformed into seismic profiles, images used to interpret the stratigraphy and geometry \n\nof the subsurface layers of the surveyed area.  \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Seismic Data Acquisition and Processing \n\nThe datasets used in this work form a heterogeneous group with different sources, acquisition parameters \n\nand seismic processing. This variability produces inconsistencies for the coverage of the study area and \n\nfor the characteristics of each dataset (such as seismic processing, vertical and horizontal resolution, \n\nquality and positioning system). Therefore, this variability can constrict the results and conclusions \n\nobtained in the present work. Also, the older seismic profiles (GSI) correspond to digitalized paper \n\nformats, TIFF to SEG-Y (Batista, 2009). This transformation inserts a boundary for the application of \n\nfurther geological or geophysical software.  \n\nAnd finally, another factor that can cause inconsistencies in seismic interpretation is the resolution vs. \n\ndepth penetration challenge. A seismic dataset is always characterized by two distinct but related \n\nproperties: resolution and penetration depth (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). These properties are \n\nconditioned by the frequency of the signal and by the type of acoustic source. In seismic reflection, \n\ndepth is measured in two-way travel time (in milliseconds or seconds) and it corresponds to the time the \n\nsound waves take since they leave the source, reflect on an interface and return to the receiver. With \n\ndepth, the frequency of the signal decreases while velocity and wavelength increase. Therefore, seismic \n\nresolution will decrease and high frequencies will be preferably reflected on shallower reflectors while \n\nlow frequencies reflect on deeper levels (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). A seismic survey is a compromise \n\nbetween these two properties, since it favours one and damages the other. Therefore, the acquisition and \n\nthe seismic processing must consider the objectives of the survey.  If a seismic survey has good \n\nresolution, it uses high frequencies and therefore does not reach the lower layers of the subsurface \n\n(Figure 5.2).  \n\nThe seismic datasets used in this study have good penetration with medium (BIGSETS and GSI, up to \n\n10 km depth) and high (CONDRIBER and STEAM, up to 4 km depth) resolution. The acquisition \n\nspecifications of the CONDRIBER seismic survey are displayed in Appendix 10.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Example of offshore seismic reflection survey with classic source and receivers\u2019 geometry.

Processing steps \n\nThe aim of seismic data processing is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus improve the vertical \n\nresolution of the individual seismic traces (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The CONDRIBER survey is \n\nconstituted by 16 multichannel high (to medium) resolution 2D seismic profiles, obtained with an airgun \n\nsource during the MOWER/CONDRIBER cruise in 2014. The CONDRIBER data was processed by the \n\nInstituto de Ciencias Marinas in Barcelona (ICM-CSIC). The processing steps applied are outlined \n\nbelow (Informe T\u00e9cnico Campa\u00f1a Mower, 2014; Appendix 10.1).  \n\nThe processing flow begun by extracting the navigation of each shot and channel through export headers \n\nfrom Seisee. This step allows the calculation of the common depth point (CDP), of each profile, on the \n\nprogram CDP3. This sequence results in a SEG-Y file with shot, channel, CDP and UTM coordinates \n\nof each CDP and shot in the headers of the traces.  \n\nThe next step was the application of a noise filter. The noise of the SIG streamer usually comes with the \n\nsame signal and other times with inverted signal due to multiple noise sources. Therefore, same signal \n\nnoise auto-eliminated itself when the polarity of one of the channels was switched and summed. The \n\nnoise with inverted signal was eliminated by applying a Matlab script (Seg4king), which replaced, for a \n\ncertain time of the trace, values which are higher than a certain magnitude of the previous and next \n\ntraces, for the measurement of these.  \n\nThe main processing flow was developed on the software Hotshot. Hotshot can create referenced \n\nbitmaps, which allow the digitalization of the seafloor depth and elimination of the water column. \n\nAfterwards, the signal of the reflections from channels 2 and 3 was switched (with function VNEG), \n\nsince the channels had inverted polarity (regarding the reflections of channel 1).  \n\nThe next step was the application of a function (RABAL) to equalize channels and shots, followed by \n\nhigh-pass filtering to eliminate frequencies lower than 30 Hz. Filtering was also employed through \n\nseveral band-pass filters, progressively applied since the seafloor: \n\n? 0 ms: 75 - 240 Hz; \n\n? 100 ms: 25 \u2013 180 Hz; \n\n? 1000 ms: 25 - 100 Hz; \n\n? 9000 ms: 20 - 100 Hz; \n\nAfterwards, a Mute removed the signal of channel 3 below 0.4 seconds.  \n\nThe profiles with sedimentary cover undertook another processing sequence: the elimination of the first \n\n150-200 ms (below the seafloor) of channels 1 and 2, to give more rebound to the high frequencies of \n\nchannel 3. This sequence was followed by Sort and Stack of the traces by order of the shot, or by CDP\u2019s \n\nfor the more superficial profiles.  \n\nThe next step was the application of a new equalization of the traces and resampling at 1 ms (since the \n\noriginals are sampled at 500 ?s). Afterwards, it was necessary to apply an Automatic Gain Control \n\n(AGC) with a window of 0.7 seconds to normalize the traces. The last step was a Shift to eliminate the \n\nfirst 50 ms of the file and to allow synchronization between register and trigger. Finally, the resultant \n\nSEG-Y file was written.  \n\nThe use of different processing steps can constrain the quality of the seismic profiles and cause \n\nimprecisions during seismic interpretation.  This also shows in the display of the seismic data and when \n\nattempting a seismic to well tie.  \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n5.2.3 Seismostratigraphic Calibration Method  \n\nTo take full advantage of Site U1391 physical properties data and to calibrate the well data with the \n\ncrossing seismic profiles, it is possible to create a model of the seismic trace: the synthetic seismogram. \n\nA synthetic seismogram is a concept manufactured from sonic (or velocity) and density logs, which is \n\ncompared to seismic data to identify reflections of particular interest (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; \n\nHardage, 2007). This process can also distinguish primary reflections from multiples or other events.  \n\nFirst, the logs have to be converted from functions of depth to functions of vertical seismic travel time \n\n(Yilmaz, 1987; Holstein, 2007). This transformation is applied by a simple equation: \n\n? = ?\u00d7?    Equation 2 \n\nWhere D represents depth (m), V the velocity (m/s) and t the seismic travel time (second). \n\nSecondly, the sonic and density logs have to be multiplied to create a log of the acoustic impedance \n\n(Equation 1). This time-based impedance is converted into a series of reflection coefficients (Equation \n\n3) (Yilmaz, 1987):  \n\n? =\n?1??2\n\n?1+?2\n=\n\n?1?1??2?2\n\n?1?1+?2?2\n   Equation 3 \n\nR \u2013 Seismic reflection coefficient; \n\n?1 \u2013 bulk density of the layer above the reflection interface (g/cm3); \n\n?2 \u2013 bulk density of the layer below the reflection interface (g/cm3); \n\nV1 \u2013 velocity of the layer above the reflection interface (m/s); \n\nV2 \u2013 of the layer below the reflection interface (m/s). \n\nAn estimated seismic wavelet is convolved with the reflectivity model to obtain a synthetic seismogram \n\n(Figure 5.3). Afterwards, the synthetic seismogram can be compared with the real seismic traces near \n\nthe well for interpretation purposes and if necessary, to apply editing. Editing involves shifting the \n\nsynthetic seismogram up and down in the time scale to determine the time shift required to position the \n\nsynthetic seismogram with optimal alignment of reflection peaks and troughs with the seismic traces \n\n(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). Other corrections are progressively applied until the synthetic model is \n\nconsidered sufficiently adjusted to the seismic trace (Anderson and Newric, 2008). As with all types of \n\nmodelling, the result is not unique, since it is possible that another different model could produce an \n\nequally good match.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Procedure for generating a synthetic seismogram (Holstein, 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nSite U1391 has velocity (from DSI Tool, km/s) and density (g/cm3) logs available. These logs were \n\nedited for bad intervals and outliers, mostly identified at the top and the bottom portions of the data.  \n\nKingdom software (SynPAK module) generates a synthetic seismogram by following the process \n\nmentioned above (Figure 5.3 and 5.4). The wavelet chosen was minimum phase with the following \n\nparameters: 20 Hz for F1, 25 Hz for F2, 75 Hz for F3 and 240 Hz for F4. The chosen frequencies \n\nconsider the band-pass filters applied during the CONDRIBER seismic processing and also the start of \n\nlogging measurements, which register from the baseline (98.9 mbsf) to the bottom of the hole (671.5 \n\nmbsf). However, it is generally preferable to extract the wavelet from the seismic data to be matched \n\n(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Anderson and Newric, 2008). The synthetic seismogram obtained is \n\npresented in normal and reverse polarity, alongside the velocity (km/s) and the density (g/cm3) logs, as \n\nwell as the acoustic impedance and the resistivity (ohm.m) logs created, shown in Figure 6.2. This \n\nKingdom software license does not possess the tools necessary to apply editing or other corrections to \n\nthe synthetic seismogram. Therefore, the interpretation and calibration of said model with the real \n\nseismic traces (from the intersected seismic profiles: CL06 or BS19) cannot be completed. But an \n\nexample of this process can be seen below (Figure 5.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Example of synthetic seismogram using the P-wave velocity (obtained from Logging-While-Drilling, LWD) and \n\nbulk density logs from the Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate Drilling Expedition 1 Site UBGH1-4, in 2007 in the Ulleung Basin, \n\noffshore Korea and a seismic wavelet extracted from 3-D seismic data (Scholz et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nThe lack of calibration between seismic reflections and the resulting seismogram can also derive from \n\nother factors: \n\n? A synthetic is an estimate of the seismic image if the imaging ray path travelled vertically \n\ndownward from a source and then reflected vertically upward along the same travel path to a \n\nreceiver located exactly at the source position. While seismic profile traces are a composite of \n\nseveral field traces, which represent wave field propagation along multiple oblique ray paths \n\nbetween sources and receivers (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995); \n\n? The effects of the near surface are not considered for a synthetic seismogram, since the velocity \n\nand density logs themselves are not recorded over shallow depths (since logging usually starts \n\nafter the placement of the pipe). Although this effect can be corrected with co-derived velocity \n\nand density measurements to create relatively continuous profiles (Cunningham and Droxler, \n\n2000; Anderson and Newric, 2008). This factor also considers the alteration caused by drilling \n\nand drilling fluid invasion, which damage the rocks and therefore affect the measurements and \n\nrepresentations of the petrophysical properties (Hardage, 2007).  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n5.2.4 Seismostratigraphic Correlation Method \n\nSeismostratigraphic correlation uses the data provided by seismic profiles and wells to establish \n\ntemporal or lateral relations between stratigraphic units or between their bounding discontinuities, and \n\ncan be applied for lithostratigraphic correlation or chronologic correlation studies (Vail et al., 1977; \n\nSnedden and Sarg, 2008).  \n\nLithostratigraphic correlation establishes a relation between strata or units with compatible lithological \n\ncharacteristics, without considering an equivalence in the geologic time scale (Vail et al., 1977; \n\nMitchum et al., 1994). Lateral relation between lithostratigraphic units implicates recognizing lateral \n\ncontinuity and using consistent and unambiguous stratigraphic markers, which are the most reliable \n\nmethod to establish a relation.  \n\nChronologic correlation assumes the occurrence of geologic time equivalence between stratigraphic \n\nunits, even with different lithology (Vail et al., 1977). This concept implicates knowing the age of the \n\ncorrelated units to establish relations between stratigraphic units of the same area and between units \n\nwith the same geologic time interval. This is also used to ascertain the position of a unit in the \n\nchronostratigraphic table at a global scale (Vail et al., 1987).  \n\nIn seismic interpretation, correlation is simply the identification of seismic units or discontinuities based \n\nin similarities between character reflection and their arrival time in a crossing point of two or more \n\nseismic profiles (time-tie) (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Snedden and Sarg, 2008). This process was chosen \n\nsince the synthetic seismogram created above was not used to tie seismic and well data.

Site U1391 time-depth chart \n\nand the stratigraphic events identified by Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al.

The key concepts of seismic \n\nstratigraphy were defined in the Memoir 26 of American Association of Petroleum Geologists entitled \n\n\u201cSeismic stratigraphy: Applications to hydrocarbon exploration\u201d (Payton, 1977). This approach focuses \n\non distinctive criteria available on seismic reflection data to interpret depositional sequences, geometry \n\nrelations, geologic information, eustatic variations and tectonic events. \n\n\n\n39 \n\nThe concept of depositional sequence is outlined as a stratigraphic unit composed of genetically related \n\nstrata (Figure 5.5), bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities (Sloss, 1963). This \n\nconcept is based on the repetitive nature of geological and sedimentary events and assumes \n\nchronostratigraphic significance for depositional sequences and their boundaries. Although not all \n\nreflections are generated by geological interfaces (such as coherent noise patterns: multiples or \n\ndiffractions). This methodology defines the depositional sequence boundaries as discontinuities or \n\ncorrelative conformities, which represent marks of erosion or non-deposition, sometimes associated with \n\na hiatus (a lapse of time that separates rocks of different ages, measured at the scale of the basin, \n\nMitchum et al., 1977a,b). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Example of depositional sequence, limited by bounded unconformities and their relative conformities (surfaces \n\nA and B) and reflectors terminations (adapted from Mitchum et al., 1977b).  \n \n\nA seismic sequence is a depositional sequence identified on a seismic section (Mitchum et al., 1977a, \n\nb). This concept defines a succession of reflections as genetically related strata, bounded at the top and \n\nbase by surfaces of discontinuity (surfaces A and B in Figure 5.5), marked as reflection terminations \n\n(Mitchum et al.,1977c). However, the conventional concept of seismic sequence and the terminology \n\ninvolved is not fully applicable to contourite studies (Nielsen et al., 2008). The conventional concept of \n\nseismic sequence implies that sequences and their strata are formed as a result of base-level changes and \n\ndownslope shelf-to-basin sediment transport, while contourites are mainly formed by bottom-currents \n\nregimes and sediment pathways orientated parallel to the continental margins. Also, the unconformities \n\nthat bound the sequences are inferred to be autocyclic and result from foreseeable changes in \n\naccommodation space, while unconformities in contourites result from a non-predictable pattern related \n\nto variations in current regime (Nielsen et al., 2008).  \n\nTherefore, it is preferable to use the term seismic succession, as suggested in Nielsen et al. (2008). \n\nSeismic successions are not associated with any specific depositional environment to denote a \n\nstratigraphic subdivision of a drift succession. The separation of seismic successions is based on the \n\nanalysis of reflection terminations and internal reflectors patterns, using the traditional techniques \n\nintroduced by Mitchum et al. (1977a,b,c). These concepts allow the definition of seismic succession as \n\na three-dimensional unit, limited by stratigraphic discontinuities and composed by a group of reflections, \n\nwhose parameters diverge from the adjacent successions. This differentiation is drawn by seismic facies, \n\na group of seismic parameters used to characterize a seismic succession and individualize it from the \n\nadjacent successions. \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Seismic Facies Analysis \n\nSeismic facies analysis is the description and geological interpretation of seismic reflection parameters, \n\nsuch as the geometry and character of the reflections, the internal configuration and the external form. \n\nThe analysis of several parameters results in a coherent structural interpretation, providing considerable \n\ninformation on the depositional environment and geology of the subsurface (Mitchum et al. 1977a,b).  \n\n\n\n40 \n\n? Reflection Terminations \n\nConsidering the geometric relations between reflections, five types of terminations can be identified to \n\ndefine discontinuities or limits of seismic upper and lower units: onlap, downlap, toplap, truncation \n\n(erosional or structural) and concordance. Baselap can also be defined if onlap and downlap are \n\nindistinguishable. Their presence indicates an important transition and depositional hiatus, as a result of \n\nerosion or non-deposition.  \n\nTop-discordant relations include truncation or toplap (Figure 5.6). Truncation, erosional and \n\nstructural, is a relation characterized by an abrupt lateral ending of the reflections against a discordant \n\nsurface. It could be generated as a result of water currents action or due to tectonic tilting of a sequence, \n\nfollowed by erosion over large areas or confined to the flanks of submarine channels. Toplap is \n\ncharacterized as the termination of reflections, interpreted as strata, against an overlying surface. Toplap \n\nis usually formed due to non-deposition hiatus and minor erosion.  \n\nBase-discordant relations include onlap and downlap (Figure 5.6). Onlap corresponds to a relation \n\nwhere seismic reflections are interpreted as initially horizontal strata terminating progressively on top \n\nof a dipping surface, or as initially inclined strata terminating progressively up dip against a surface of \n\nhigher dip. These terminations are associated with seafloor irregularities, caused by non-depositional \n\nhiatus or by deposition on tilted blocks. Downlap is characterized as initially dipping strata terminating \n\ndowndip against an initially dipping or horizontal surface, and results from non-deposition hiatus.  \n\n \nFigure 5.6 \u2013 Seismic reflection terminations, according to Mitchum et al. (1977b), from Roque (2007). \n \n\n? Reflection Configurations \n\nThe overall geometry of a seismic facies unit consists of the internal reflection configuration and the \n\nexternal form of the unit. The identification of different reflection configurations indicates a geological \n\nvariation in the seismic unit and carries geological significance (Mitchum et al., 1977c). The variations \n\nare identified by the following parameters: reflection continuity, amplitude, frequency and signature.  \n\nContinuity is identified by lateral juxtaposition of successive reflections of the same horizon and is \n\nrelated to the physical continuity of the strata. Therefore, continuous reflections suggest widespread, \n\nuniformly stratified deposits. Continuity of a given horizon is interpreted as preservation of the \n\ndepositional conditions with no main changes in the energy of the environment. \n\nAmplitude is associated with the maximum amplitude of the reflected wave, which is dependent on the \n\nvelocity and density contrasts through each individual interface and the spacing between interfaces (high \n\nUPPER BOUNDARY \n\nCONFORMITY TRUNCATION TOPLAP \n\nCONFORMITY \n\nDOWNLAP ONLAP \n\nLOWER BOUNDARY \n\n\n\n41 \n\namplitudes reflect high acoustic impedance). If a high amplitude reflection diminishes rapidly, it usually \n\nindicates a high energy depositional environment and the opposite suggests a large continuity of the \n\nformations and a stable depositional environment. \n\nFrequency is the time interval between two successive reflections.  The frequency reflects the \n\ninstrumental seismic characteristics but it is also influenced by other factors such as the thickness of the \n\nlayered deposits and the presence of fluids. There is an inverse relation between strata thickness and \n\nreflection thickness: high frequencies correspond to thin strata.  \n\n \n\n? Internal Reflection Configurations \n\nConsidering the geometric relations between reflections, the description and interpretation of internal \n\nreflection configurations begins with simple patterns and continues to the more complex. The \n\nconfigurations occur as a result of the depositional rate, energy, lithology, erosion, deformation and \n\npaleomorphology of the basin (Mitchum et al., 1977c). \n\nThe parallel and subparallel (even or wavy) patterns (Figure 5.7) refer to high amplitude, continuous \n\nand parallel reflections. These patterns suggest uniform depositional rates on a steady subsiding shelf or \n\nstable basin plain setting. \n\nThe divergent pattern (Figure 5.7) is related to a wedge-shaped sequence of seismic horizons. It \n\nsuggests lateral variations in depositional rates or the progressive tilting of the depositional surface.  \n\nThe chaotic pattern (Figure 5.7) is identified by discontinuous, discordant and disordered reflections. \n\nThis pattern suggests a high energy setting with variable depositional conditions and it is generally found \n\nin slump structures, erosion derived deposits, cut-and-fill channel complexes and zones highly affected \n\nby faults or folds. \n\nThe transparent pattern (Figure 5.7) is characterized by the total or partial absence of reflections or by \n\nthe lack of lateral continuity. This pattern is associated with homogeneous rocks, highly deformed or \n\nmetamorphosed rocks, salt features and large igneous bodies. Although thick and seismically \n\nhomogeneous sequences of shales or sandstones can also appear reflection-free.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 Seismic internal reflection patterns, according to Mitchum et al. (1977c). \n\n \n\nTRANSPARENT CHAOTIC DIVERGENT \n\nSUBPARALLEL PARALLEL \n\nEVEN WAVY \n\n\n\n42 \n\nThe most common depositional features observed in seismic profiles are clinoforms, represented by \n\ncomplex reflection configurations.   \n\nPrograding clinoforms configurations correspond to packages of oblique to sigmoidal shaped \n\nreflections. These configurations are interpreted as strata where significant deposition occurred as a \n\nresult of prograding or lateral sedimentation outbuilding. There are several sub-types of prograding \n\nconfigurations, such as sigmoid, oblique, tangential and parallel, sigmoid-oblique, shingled and \n\nhummocky (Figure 5.8). The differences in prograding clinoform patterns occur due to variations in the \n\ndepositional rate and water depth, and a wide variety of environmental settings is possible.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 \u2013 Seismic internal reflection patterns of prograding clinoforms (from Mitchum et al., 1977c). \n \n\nSigmoid progradational configuration (Figure 5.8) is an S-shaped clinoform, interpreted as thin, gently \n\ndipping strata at the top and base with a thicker, steeper intermediate sector. This configuration suggests \n\na low energy setting with low sediment supply, relatively rapid basin subsidence and/or rapid sea-level \n\nrise. \n\nOblique progradational configuration (Figure 5.8) is interpreted as steep-dipping strata with a toplap \n\ntermination at or near a horizontal or subhorizontal upper boundary and a downlap termination against \n\nthe lower boundary. New strata build almost entirely laterally in a depositionally downdip direction, as \n\na result of the foreset steepness.  \n\nIn the tangential oblique progradational pattern (Figure 5.8), the dip decreases gradually in the foreset, \n\nforming concave-upward strata that change into a gently dipping bottomset strata. The strata become \n\nthinner towards the lower boundary, with downlap terminations.  \n\nIn the parallel oblique progradational configuration (Figure 5.8), the foreset strata maintain a \n\nrelatively steep dip from top to bottom and terminate with a high angle by downlap at the lower \n\nboundary. The oblique progradation configuration is related to high energy sedimentary settings with a \n\nhigh sedimentary supply, slow to no basin subsidence and a still stand of the sea-level, which allows \n\nsedimentary bypass or scouring of the upper depositional surface. \n\nThe complex sigmoid-oblique progradational configuration (Figure 5.8) is a complex prograding \n\nclinoform, defined by a combination of variably alternating sigmoid and oblique progradational \n\nconfigurations in the same seismic unit. This variation suggests alternating up-building and depositional \n\nbypass on a high energy regime.  \n\nCOMPLEX SIGMOID-OBLIQUE \n\nHUMMOCKY \n\nSHINGLED \n\nSIGMOID \n\nOBLIQUE \n\nTANGENCIAL \n\nPARALLEL \n\n\n\n43 \n\nShingled progradational configuration (Figure 5.8) is a thin prograding pattern, generally with parallel \n\nupper and lower boundaries and gently dipping parallel internal reflectors, which are oblique and \n\nterminate by toplap and downlap. This pattern suggests the formation of depositional units prograding \n\ninto shallow water. \n\nThe hummocky clinoform configuration (Figure 5.8) is characterized by irregular and subparallel \n\nreflection segments forming a rather irregular hummocky pattern, with non-systematic reflection \n\nterminations and splits. This configuration is interpreted as strata forming small, interfingering \n\nclinoforms lobes, which build into shallow water in a prodelta or inter-deltaic setting. \n\n \n\n? External Form \n\nThe interpretation of depositional sequences comprehends an understanding of three-dimensional \n\nexternal forms and an association to different seismic facies units.  Therefore, the external form is used \n\nto individualize a seismic unit, characterized by variable extent and geometry. Several external forms \n\ncan be distinguished: sheet, sheet drape, wedge, bank, lens, mound and fill (Figure 5.9). External shapes \n\nsuch as sheets, wedges, lens and banks (Figure 5.9) can reach large sizes and display parallel, divergent \n\nor prograding patterns as internal reflection configurations. \n\nSheet drapes are generally related to the deposition of pelagic or hemipelagic sediments on the \n\nunderlying topography in a low energy, deep-marine environment.  \n\nMound shapes are interpreted as strata that forms build ups, elevations or prominences. Mounds can \n\nhave different origins as a result of carbonate edifications or diapirs. These shapes have usually small \n\ndimensions with diverse internal configurations. \n\nFill patterns correspond to strata filling a negative-relief feature in the underlying strata. These deposits \n\ncan have different internal configurations, such as onlap, chaotic, prograding and divergent. Fill deposits \n\ncan reach over large areas (from meters to kilometres) when in a basin context or be smaller (from \n\ncentimeters to meters) when in the dependency of a channel.  \n\n \nFigure 5.9 \u2013 External forms of seismic facies units. Extracted from Mitchum et al. (1977c).  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n5.3.2 Seismic Interpretation Procedure \n\nThe seismic interpretation procedure of a contourite depositional system is well-defined in Nielsen et \n\nal. (2008). This procedure can be applied on this study, since it orders the seismic interpretation by an \n\nincreasing level of seismic detail (which are named seismic elements), and respects the previous \n\nseismostratigraphic concepts. The procedure is outlined as follows (Figure 5.10): \n\n?

Second-order elements are medium-scale features, which correspond to the internal architecture \n\nand focus on the sub-units of the large-scale depositional units; \n \n\n?

SeisWorks was used to view \n\nand interpret seismic profiles, through mapping of seismic horizons and faults. PowerView was used to \n\nview and create isobaths and isopachs maps, which represent the spatial distribution of a selected \n\nhorizon\u2019s depth and the spatial variation of a unit\u2019s thickness. Also, a seismostratigraphic correlation of \n\nSite U1391 with the crossing seismic profiles was applied through Landmark Openworks Database \n\nManagement.  \n\n \n\nArcGIS \u2013 the ArcGIS software developed by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) is a \n\ngeographic information system (GIS) with different modules. The main module, ArcMap, was used for \n\nthe compilation of data and creation of the isobaths and isopachs maps rendered in this study. Also, the \n\nArcScene module was used to generate 3D displays of a few selected maps.  \n\n \n\nKingdom \u2013 the Kingdom software from IHS Corporation has multiple modules. SynPAK was used to \n\ncreate synthetic seismograms, using IODP well data and seismic data.

The global GEBCO (2003) data was used to fill in the gaps of the SWIM dataset. BS \u2013 \n\nBow Spur; DS \u2013 Descobridores Seamounts; PAP \u2013 Pr\u00edncipe de Avis Plateau; PAS \u2013 Pr\u00edncipe de Avis Seamounts; PSF \u2013 Pereira \n\nde Sousa Fault; RLB \u2013 Rinc\u00e3o do Lebre Basin; SVC \u2013 S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon; SC \u2013 Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\n \n\nWest             East \nsector             sector \n\nPortugal \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThe SD is located between 1000 and 2000 m water depth on the Alentejo continental slope and has \n\napproximately 70 km of extension and 40 km of width. In general, the SD displays an asymmetric shape \n\nwith a steeper western slope (0-5\u00baW) and plastered morphology. The seafloor morphology on the SD \n\ncan be divided in east and west sectors due to the presence of different morphologic features.  \n\nThe east sector is characterized by a smooth seafloor morphology. Also, the SD has an eastern moat, 70 \n\nkm long, 0.5-1 km wide and 150 m deep, located between 1000 m and 1250 m depth with NNW-SSE \n\nto NNE-SSW orientation. The moat starts at the south, from the SVC, and curves around the continental \n\nshelf towards the SC. The moat is probably scoured by the MOW\u2019s upper core (MU) that flows between \n\n600-1000 m water depths (Bower et al., 2002; Llave et al., 2007b).  \n\nThe western sector is marked by numerous depressions at the Pereira de Sousa Scarp (approximately \n\n20\u00ba gradient, dip towards west, 50 km length and 1400 m height) between 1500 m and 2000 m depth. \n\nThese occurrences are characterized by amphitheater shapes and head scarps, staggered till the slope \n\n(Figure 6.1) and were therefore interpreted as landslide scars and MTD from slope failure and gravity-\n\ndriven events. \n\nThe SD is located between the distal segments of two canyons: the S\u00e3o Vicente at south and the Set\u00fabal \n\nat north (Figure 6.1). Furthermore, the SD is seated on the steep scarp of the PSF and confined towards \n\neast by structurally controlled basement highs (<1000 m depth). The S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon is \n\ncharacterized by a NE-SW orientation and extends from 200 m close to the shore to 4900 m depths at \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. The Set\u00fabal Canyon is characterized by a meander shape and reaches \n\ndepths around 5000 m at the Tagus Abyssal Plain.  \n\nThe SD is located east of the Rinc\u00e3o do Lebre Basin (RLB). The passage from the SD (at 1000 m depth) \n\nto the RLB (at 3200 m depth) is marked by the abrupt N-S slope of the Pereira de Sousa Scarp. The \n\nRLB is an inner basin of the Infante Dom Henrique Basin, located between 3200 and 4000 m depth and \n\nconfined to the north and to the south by the Pr\u00edncipe de Avis Plateau (PAP) and the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal \n\nPlateau (MPP), respectively. The RLB gives the seafloor a smooth morphology, except near the base of \n\nthe Pereira de Sousa Scarp where it receives gravity-driven deposits from the nearby relief.  \n\nThe SD is also surrounded by other morphostructures, which are from north to south (Figure 6.1): the \n\nPr\u00edncipe de Avis Seamounts and Plateau (PAS and PAP), the Bow Spur, and the Descobridores \n\nSeamounts (DS). The PAP is located between 1500 and 5000 m depth with an E-W elongated shape. \n\nThe PAS separate the margin into two sub-basins, between the Set\u00fabal and the S\u00e3o Vicente canyons. \n\nThe Bow Spur is a relief advanced towards west (about 10 km), related to the Pereira de Sousa Scarp. \n\nLittle can be said about the DS due to the absence of bathymetric data in this area, but the DS have been \n\ndescribed by several authors as tectonic uplifted structures (e.g. Mougenot, 1989; Zitellini et al., 2004).  \n\n \n\n6.2 Chronostratigraphic constraints \n\nAn important aspect to better understand contourites is a detailed sedimentological work, which will aid \n\nin the identification of contourite facies. Therefore, based on acquired well data we can: i) correlate \n\nseismic units with contourite successions, ii) identify any diagnostic criteria for contourite deposits and \n\niii) associate the resulting observations with contourite formation factors on the SW Portuguese margin. \n\nWell Pescada-1 and Site U1391 data gave the depths and ages of the main discontinuities (Table 6.1). \n\nThe synthetic seismogram created in the Kingdom software to make a chronostratigraphic correlation is \n\npresented below, despite no editing applied.\n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n0      1      2      3 0      3000   6000 Reverse Polarity \n\n \n\nP \n\nNormal Polarity \n\nStratigraphic \nAge \n\nVelocity Log. \n(km/s) \n\nResistivity \n(ohm.m) \n\nWavelet  \n(Min.

Despite no editing and calibration, the main stratigraphic discontinuities (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015) are represented to the \n\nright.  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n6.2.1 Correlation with Pescada-1 oil-well  \n\nOil industry well Pescada-1 data was correlated to the older seismic horizons. Pescada-1 well correlated \n\nthe B unconformity, the lower boundary of the SD, to the Late Miocene (Figure 6.3). Therefore, seismic \n\nunit U1 is inferred as Late Miocene deposits.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile GSI68 displaying well Pescada-1 and the B \n\nunconformity.

Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n6.2.2 Correlation with IODP Expedition 339 data \n\nThis section focus on well data acquired at IODP Expedition 339 Site U1391, which targeted the SD. \n\nThe well data provide a wide-variety of information regarding lithology, downhole logging and physical \n\nproperties (Chapter 5, Point 5.1.3). Therefore, a correlation between seismic horizons and units \n\nidentified in the present work and the stratigraphic hiatus, lithology and physical properties variations \n\nfound at Site U1391 was made. The crossing seismic reflection profiles BS19 and CL06 were calibrated \n\nusing Site U1391 data (Figure 6.4).  \n\nThe bottom of the U1391C borehole at 671.5 mbsf reached Late Pliocene sediments (estimated to span \n\n3.31-3.5 Ma) below horizon H3, which corresponds to the top of seismic unit U2. Hence, a Late Pliocene \n\nage was assigned to the uppermost part of seismic unit U2 deposits (Figure 6.4 and Table 6.1).  \n\n         \n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile BS19 with Site U1391 and the correlated \n\ndiscontinuities. H3, H4, H6A and H6B: seismic horizons; FM: seafloor horizon. Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n \n\nTo determine the ages of the seismic units, the seismic horizons were correlated with the main \n\ndiscontinuities of the Pliocene-Quaternary succession of Site U1391. The correlations are: horizon H3 \n\ncorresponds to the Late Pliocene Discontinuity (LPD); horizon H4 correlates to the Early Quaternary \n\nDiscontinuity (EQD); horizon H6A corresponds to the Middle Pleistocene Discontinuity (MPD); and \n\nhorizon H6B corresponds to the Late Quaternary Discontinuity (LQD). The seismostratigraphic \n\ncorrelation is presented in Figure 6.4 and Table 6.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Correlation between the main seismic horizons identified in the present work and the stratigraphic hiatus and \n\nunconformities found at well Pescada-1 (Matias, 2002; Batista, 2009) and at IODP Expedition 339 Site U1391 (Expedition 339 \n\nScientists, 2012; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015).

The seismic \n\ndatasets were interpreted to assess the main depositional environmental changes and controlling factors, \n\nthrough the relation between seismic facies and the main structures and depocenters. This work focused \n\non the Late Neogene through Quaternary sedimentary record, where six seismic units were identified \n\n(U1 to U6), bound by important seismic horizons (B to H6). See Appendix 10.3 for the complete \n\ninterpreted seismic profiles.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Location of the seismic reflection profiles, IODP Expedition 339 Site U1391 and well Pescada-1. The black lines \nand numbers indicate the sections of the seismic profiles shown in this Chapter. \n\n \n\nThe Neogene sedimentary succession is bounded by an important basal discontinuity, named in this \n\nwork the B unconformity (Figure 6.6). The B unconformity is interpreted as an erosive and irregular \n\nsurface, with high amplitude and excellent lateral continuity at the scale of the basin (Figure 6.8). The \n\nB unconformity is marked by truncation terminations of the older deposits (deformed and sometimes \n\npoorly imaged reflections) and by downlap terminations for the overlying unconformable sequence \n\n(characterized as quasi-conformable units).  \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.6 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile BS07A.

Location of \n\nseismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n \n\n6.3.1 Seismic Unit U1 \n\nThe older seismic unit identified in this study is U1 of Late Miocene deposits, which lies on the B \n\nunconformity and is topped by horizon H2 (Figure 6.6). Horizon H2 shows high amplitude and good \n\nlateral continuity, marked by reflections of U1 with toplap terminations. Horizon H2 is generally \n\nconformable with the overlying seismic unit U2.  \n\nSeismic unit U1 is characterized by parallel low amplitude and continuous reflections with onlap \n\nterminations towards SE, with semi-transparent facies and a wedge configuration (Figure 6.7). In the \n\nnorth sector, this unit is thicker over the western horst h1, bounded by the PSF, with average thickness \n\nof 200 ms TWT and maximum thickness of 530 ms TWT (Figure 6.8). This unit is further subdivided \n\ninto two seismic sub-units, U1A and U1B, since it is possibly to identify reflections with toplap \n\nterminations on U1A and onlap terminations on U1B, marking a local discontinuity identified as horizon \n\nH1. Horizon H1 marks a vertical amplitude decrease from U1A (characterized by semi-transparent \n\nfacies) to U1B (with transparent facies).  \n\n\n\n52 \n\n6.3.2 Seismic Unit U2 \n\nSeismic unit U2 of Early Pliocene deposits is bounded at the base by horizon H2 and at the top by \n\nhorizon H3. Horizon H3 is a high amplitude reflection, laterally continuous and marked by toplap \n\nterminations of U2 (Figure 6.6).  \n\nSeismic unit U2 shows a similar facies (transparent) and configuration when compared to seismic unit \n\nU1, with low amplitude, continuous and subparallel reflections and divergent reflections when it \n\ncounters structural highs at the boundaries of the basin (Figure 6.7). Unit U2 is characterized as a thick \n\nand widespread unit, with lens configuration and average thickness of 220 ms TWT and maximum \n\nthickness of 250 ms TWT. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.7 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) seismic profile CL01E displaying the drift\u2019s asymmetric shape and MTD \n\nidentified in the west.

Location of seismic profile \n\nin Figure 6.5. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n6.3.3 Seismic Unit U3 \n\nSeismic unit U3, of Late Pliocene age, lies on top of H3 and is topped by H4. Horizon H4 is a high \n\namplitude and laterally continuous reflection, marked by toplap and truncation reflections of the \n\nunderlying units (U1 to U3), denoting, respectively, its non-depositional and erosive character (Figure \n\n6.7). Horizon H4 changes laterally to concordance with the overlying seismic unit (U4) in the middle of \n\nthe basin. \n\nSeismic unit U3 shows variable low to medium amplitude, parallel reflections with good lateral \n\ncontinuity and semi-transparent facies. The distribution of unit U3 is extensive laterally, in a lens \n\nconfiguration, with average thickness of 130 ms TWT and maximum thickness of 150 ms TWT.  \n\n \n\n6.3.4 Seismic Unit U4 \n\nSeismic unit U4, of Early Pleistocene deposits, is bound by horizon H4 at the base and horizon H5 at \n\nthe top. Horizon H5 is a high amplitude reflection with good lateral continuity, marked by toplap \n\nterminations of U4 internal reflections and downlap terminations of U5 reflections. Horizon H5 changes \n\nlaterally to conformable with the subsequently deposited unit, seismic unit U5. \n\nSeismic unit U4 is characterized by a significant change in acoustic facies, with stratified facies and \n\nhigh amplitude, parallel and laterally continuous reflections (Figure 6.8). Although this unit is also \n\ncharacterized by highly chaotic and irregular reflections in the east, with multiple erosive surfaces, \n\nrelated to the erosion and fill of a channel feature interpreted as a paleomoat (Figure 6.19). This unit \n\nreaches an average thickness of 110 ms TWT and maximum thickness of 280 ms TWT.  \n\n \n\n6.3.5 Seismic Unit U5 \n\nSeismic unit U5 of Early Pleistocene deposits is bound by horizon H5 at the base and horizon H6A at \n\nthe top. Horizon H6A is a high amplitude, continuous and parallel reflection. Horizon H6A is marked \n\nby toplap terminations of unit U5 (Figure 6.7).  \n\nUnit U5 has stratified facies with high amplitude and continuous reflections in the center of the basin \n\nand chaotic to semi-transparent reflections related to the fill of a paleomoat. This unit has an average \n\nthickness of 190 ms TWT and maximum thickness of 330 ms TWT. Units U4 and U5 mark the \n\nbeginning of the build-up of a mounded drift towards south, with a small upslope progradation of the \n\nunit towards the continental shelf and a prominent paleomoat along the continental shelf (Figure 6.19).  \n\n \n\n  6.3.6 Seismic Unit U6 \n\nThe most recent seismic unit is U6, of Middle Pleistocene to Holocene age, which is bound by horizon \n\nH6A at the base and by the seafloor at the top (horizon FM). Unit U6 is defined as a widespread unit \n\nwith stratified facies characterized by parallel and high amplitude internal reflections, defining a sheet \n\nconfiguration (Figure 6.7). Unit U6 reaches a maximum thickness of 340 ms TWT with an average of \n\n280 ms TWT.  \n\nSeismic unit U6 can be divided into three sub-units (from bottom to top, U6A, U6B and U6C) separated \n\nby two internal discontinuities, horizons H6B and H6C, both marked by toplap terminations on the \n\nunderlying sub-units and downlap terminations on the overlying sub-units. These discontinuities \n\nrepresent erosional unconformities on the basin margins, close to the flanks of structural highs, changing \n\nlaterally to concordance in the middle of the basins. This unit is characterized by small paleomoats in \n\nthe east, marked by toplap terminations of the underlying sub-units and semi-transparent facies.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) seismic profile CL07 showing the seismic character of the seismic units and their configuration.

Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n6.4 Lithostratigraphy of Site U1391  \n\nThe lithological and physical properties characterization of seismic horizons and units was also made \n\nby correlation with IODP Expedition 339 data provided at IODP\u2019s online database: \n\nhttp://iodp.tamu.edu/index.html. Visual description of cores and high-resolution photos taken during the \n\nExpedition 339 allowed a lithological and facies variations characterization. The main lithology \n\nrecognized at Site U1391 was calcareous silty mud with few intervals of coarse-grained deposits, namely \n\ncalcareous silty sand, mostly in the first 200 mbsf, and a debrite (~0.35 m) at 604 mbsf with muddy \n\nintraclasts and matrix (Figure 6.10 A to C). These lithologies are associated with bigradational contourite \n\ndepositional successions with gradational contacts and bioturbation, which coarsens upwards from \n\nnannofossil muds through calcareous silty muds to calcareous silty sands and then fine up in the opposite \n\norder to calcareous silty mud and nannofossil muds, between 0 and 196.1 mbsf (Figure 6.10 C). Sharp \n\ncontacts or rarer discontinuities occur between 0 and 196.1 mbsf and cut the contourite depositional \n\nsuccessions and therefore partial bigradational, normal or reverse grading are also common (Appendix \n\n10.2). Other sediments also occur interbedded with the contourites, such as calcareous muds between \n\n196.1 and 566 mbsf, hemipelagites from 196.1 to 671.5 mbsf, biosiliceous muds between 562 and 671.5 \n\nmbsf and a dolomitic mudstone of ~0.87 m at 632 mbsf. \n\n \n\n6.4.1 Downhole Logging  \n\nThe downhole logging data obtained at Site U1391 was analysed in the present work to better \n\ncharacterize the spatial and temporal variability of the depositional record in the given sedimentological \n\ncontext. The physical parameters used in this characterization were resistivity (ohm.m), density (g/cm3), \n\ngamma ray (gAPI) and sonic velocity (km/s). The grain size rank was also used to determine potential \n\ncorrelations with referred logging properties. The resistivity log is used to characterize the sediments by \n\nmeasuring their electrical resistivity (Cannon, 2016). The resistivity log shows highly variable values, \n\n0.2 to 3 ohm.m, between 107 and 153 mbsf (Figure 6.9). These increased values probably mark the \n\npresence of coarse-grained sediments. In general, the resistivity log shows an increase with depth, from \n\n1.5 to 5.5 ohm.m, between 153 and 562 mbsf.  \n\nThe sonic velocity and density logs track rock composition changes and the effective stress (Cannon, \n\n2016). If effective stress increases, sediment compaction occurs and the logs show increasing values. \n\nLow values of sonic velocity and density can indicate an increase of clay minerals, organic matter or \n\nporosity. At Site U1391, the sonic velocity and density logs show a general increase with depth, \n\nreaching, respectively, 1.6 to 2.2 km/s and 1.4 to 2.1 g/cm3 between 96 and 562 mbsf (Figure 6.9). These \n\nincreased values show the effect of compaction and a sequence characterized by silt to clay mud facies.  \n\nAll rocks possess some natural gamma radioactivity, due to the presence of potassium, thorium or \n\nuranium (Ellis and Singer, 2007). Gamma ray is used mainly to track clay content in the sediment, since \n\nhigh gamma ray values usually identify fine-grained sediments with potassium rich clay minerals and \n\nabsorbed uranium and thorium components (Cannon, 2016). Conversely, low values indicate no \n\nradioactive elements and usually identify quartz and calcite (Lofi et al., 2016). The gamma ray downhole \n\nlogging values obtained at site U1391 range between 30 and 65 gAPI until 153 mbsf, and between 30 \n\nand 75 gAPI from 153 to 562 mbsf (Figure 6.9). The higher values are probably tracking the clay content.  \n\nResistivity, density and gamma ray logs show a decrease at 562 mbsf, with no high values of gamma \n\nray below (30-50 gAPI), which indicates a decrease in clay content and probable presence of sandy \n\nintervals, especially between 562-582 mbsf and 593-605 mbsf with 30 gAPI lows (Figure 6.8). This \n\nindicates a change in sediment facies at 562 mbsf and therefore separates the sediment column into two \n\nsub-units, IA and IB. This limit could be placed in the transition from seismic unit U3 to U4 and \n\ncorresponds to seismic horizon H4, which is close to the Quaternary-Pliocene boundary (Table 6.2). \n\nHigher values of resistivity (3 ohm.m), density (2.5 g/cm3) and velocity (2.9 km/s) and low values of \n\ngamma ray occur at 632 mbsf corresponding to a well-consolidated dolomite mudstone (Figure 6.10 B). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 U1391 logging and sedimentological properties, from left to right: U1391A and U1391B major lithology (average and maximum) grain size rank; resistivity log (ohm.m); HROM \n\ndensity (g/cm3); gamma ray log (gAPI); U1391C and U1391A velocity (km/s) with DSI Tool; IODP U1391 lithological, physical properties and logging units; seismic units identified on this study. \n\nOrange lines: sand layers; blue lines: main stratigraphic discontinuities. \n\n Resistivity  Density \n\n\n\n57 \n\n6.4.2 Physical Properties \n\nThe physical properties from Site U1391 were used in this work to study the sedimentological and \n\nmineralogical variations of the contouritic successions. The grain size rank, reflectance (L*, a* and b*), \n\nnatural gamma ray total counts (cps), bulk density (g/cm3) and magnetic susceptibility (instrumental \n\nunits) were used to identify the main sedimentary units of the SD and their relation to the seismic units.  \n\nGrain size variations in contourites usually result from changes in the strength of the predominant \n\nbottom-current (Stow et al., 2013). However, it is still difficult to determine whether a change in mean \n\ngrain size indicates variations in mean speed, frequency and amplitude of the current velocity or an \n\nincrease of sediment supply by rivers and downslope processes (Mulder et al., 2013). In general, coarser \n\ngrain size present higher gamma ray attenuation (GRA), density, magnetic susceptibility and a* \n\nmeasurements. The major lithology, calcareous silty mud, is interbedded by six sandy layers in the first \n\n150 mbsf at 2, 50, 83, 96, 115 and 150 mbsf with variable thickness. The average grain size at Site \n\nU1391 is mostly clay to silt with bigradational, normal or reverse grading successions (Figure 6.11).  \n\nMagnetic susceptibility reveals changes in the mineralogical composition, mainly the concentration of \n\nferromagnetic grains in the sediment (Blum, 1997). Measurement of this parameter at Site U1391 \n\nrevealed cyclic variations between 5 x 10-5 SI and 60 x 10-5 SI with a decrease at 28 mbsf, from 65 x 10-\n\n5 SI to -10 x 10-5 SI. Also, the magnetic susceptibility is lower after 105 mbsf, under 20 x 10-5 SI in the \n\nfirst 100 mbsf and lower than 10 x 10-5 SI below that level (Figure 6.11). The natural gamma ray (NGR) \n\ntrend mirrors the clay content, with values between 20 and 55 cps. NGR has regular values between 35 \n\nand 50 cps in the first 200 mbsf, which can be correlated to the higher number of sandy layers. Although \n\nat 560 mbsf, occurs a change to values between 30 and 45 cps which indicates facies variation and the \n\nseparation of the lithostratigraphic column into two sub-units, III and IV.  \n\nColor and lightness changes in sediments are caused by the abundance and variations of different \n\nsedimentary phases (Blum, 1997). These variations can be seen in magnetic susceptibility, bulk density, \n\nand other physical parameters. Measurements of color reflectance at Site U1391 show an alternation of \n\ngreenish and reddish intervals, with the disappearance of the reddish intervals below 200 mbsf (Figure \n\n6.11). The values of a* are positive for the reddish intervals and negative and less variable below 200 \n\nmbsf. The color reflectance measurements (L*, a* and b*) show a positive relation for most of the Site, \n\nwith a few intervals with slightly higher values. The bulk density has values ranging from 1.4 to 2.1 \n\ng/cm3 and shows variations between 1.85 and 1.9 g/cm3 from 250 to 400 mbsf. Bulk density is variable \n\nfor the first 250 mbsf and this variation is also visible in the other measurements, indicating a possible \n\nseparation of different sedimentary units. At 632 mbsf, bulk density reaches a maximum of 2.4 g/cm3, \n\nrelated to the presence of a dolomitic mudstone. \n\nSeveral correlations between the different  physical properties described above were deduced in this \n\nwork as follows: i) between 0-150 mbsf occurs a positive correlation between NGR, grain size, magnetic \n\nsusceptibility and a* with low bulk density and widely fluctuating a* values; ii) a distinct second interval \n\nat 150-200 mbsf displays negative correlation between NGR and a* and reduced scatter of data; iii) a \n\nthird interval from 200-560 mbsf has a positive correlation between NGR, magnetic susceptibility and \n\nbulk density with lower magnetic susceptibility; iv) a last interval from 560 mbsf to the bottom of the \n\nhole is clearly recognized by low NGR and magnetic susceptibility, and a considerably reduced scatter \n\nof data (Figure 6.11); v) at 604 mbsf, a ~35 cm debrite occurs, although its presence is not clear in the \n\nvisual logs (Figure 6.10 A and 6.11); vi) at 632 mbsf, a dolomitic mudstone is identified by low NGR \n\nand bulk density and higher color reflectance measurements (L*, a* and b*).  \n\nDuring the IODP Expedition 339 the shipboard scientists divided the sedimentary record retrieved at \n\nSite U1391 into two lithological units based on visual core description, core logging and smear slides \n\n\n\n58 \n\nanalysis (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012; Figure 6.9 and 6.11): i) Unit I (0-566.1 mbsf) and ii) Unit II \n\n(566.1-671.5 mbsf). Unit I is made of contourite rich layers with two sub-units separated by facies \n\nvariation, IA and IB. Unit IA (0-196.1 mbsf) is clearly dominated by calcareous muds with few intervals \n\nof siliciclastic sediments, silty and sandy muds. In contrast, unit IB (196.1-353.5 mbsf) is characterized \n\nby calcareous mud, silty mud and very few sandy mud layers. Unit I has an estimated sedimentation rate \n\nof 17 cm/k.y from 2.58 to 1.5 Ma in the Pleistocene and 27 cm/k.y from ~1.5 Ma to the seafloor. Unit \n\nII has mixed facies with thin contourite beds with calcareous and bioclastic sediments, a debrite and a \n\ndolomitic mudstone and low sedimentation rate of 13 cm/k.y during the Pliocene. \n\nThe integration of the sedimentological and physical properties analysis with the seismic model shows \n\na clear correlation between U1391 lithological units and the seismic units identified in this work. Unit \n\nIA corresponds to seismic unit U6, unit IB to seismic units U4 and U5 and unit II to seismic unit U3 and \n\ntop of U2 (Table 6.2). The occurrence of lithological variations throughout the sedimentary record is \n\nrelated to the depositional environment. Therefore, we can probably infer that during the deposition of \n\nunit II (seismic units U2 and U3) in the Late Pliocene to Early Quaternary, the MOW probably flowed \n\nas a weak bottom-current and upwelling and downslope processes occurred intersected. Afterwards, \n\nduring the deposition of unit IB (seismic unit U4 and U5) in the Early Pleistocene, upwelling occurred \n\nwith an increase of the MOW, probably related to bottom-current enhancement. And finally, from the \n\nMiddle Pleistocene to the Present, the deposition of unit IA (seismic unit U6) indicates the MOW had a \n\nslight increase of strength and velocity and possibly six episodes of bottom-current enhancement, related \n\nto the presence of the sandy intervals. \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.10 A to C \u2013 High-\n\nresolution photos taken onboard \n\nthe IODP Expedition 339 Site \n\nU1391 showing selected \n\nexamples of the main sedimentary \n\nfacies for contourites, dolomite \n\nmudstone and debrite recovered at \n\nSite U1391. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.11 \u2013 U1391 physical and sedimentological properties, from left to right: U1391A and U1391B major lithology (average and maximum) grain size rank; U1391B grain density (g/cm3); \n\nReflectance (L*, a* and b*); natural gamma ray total counts (cps); bulk density (g/cm3); magnetic susceptibility (instrumental units); IODP U1391 lithological, physical properties and logging \n\nunits; seismic units identified on this study.

The different but complementary resolutions of these profiles allowed a multi-scale \n\nanalysis of the main tectonic structures in the study area. \n\n \n\n6.5.1 Main tectonic structures \n\nTwo major structurally controlled basement highs were identified: the western horst h1 limited by the \n\nPSF and the eastern horst h2 limited by fault F2.  \n\nHorst h1 is limited by the PSF at the west and by the fault F1 at the east. The PSF is a key feature of \n\nthis study area and is characterized by a NNE-SSW orientation, steep ~1400 m high scarp wall and 50 \n\nkm of extension (Figure 6.12).  F1 is a normal NNE-SSW trending fault with 40 km length.  \n\nThe horst h1, bounded by PSF and F1, controlled the deposition of seismic units U1 through U6 (Late \n\nMiocene to Holocene deposits) reducing the accommodation space available for the Sines Contourite \n\nDrift development. Therefore, this drift is thinner above the horst. Other smaller NNE-SSW steep \n\nnormal and reverse faults offset the older seismic units, U1 to U3 (Late Miocene to Early Pleistocene) \n\n(Figure 6.13 and 6.14).  \n\nThe referred normal faults illustrate the Mesozoic extensional architecture and the segmentation of the \n\nWest Iberian margin and later a few were reversed by the tectonic inversion events related to the Alpine \n\nOrogeny, since they affected the sedimentary succession. Fault F1 is a structure buried under the post-\n\nrift sequence, while the PSF shows a well-developed scarp, suggesting passive exhumation (Figure \n\n6.12). \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile BS19 displaying the PSF and associated MTD \n\naccumulation.

Location of seismic \n\nprofile in Figure 6.5. \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nThe horst h2 is a structural high limited by normal fault F2 of NNW-SSE orientation and 75 km of \n\nextension (Figure 6.13). This fault was inherited from the Mesozoic rifting of the West Iberian margin, \n\nwhich segmented the margin into multiple planes. \n\nThe fault F2 is also responsible for a block uplift at the southwest, since the sediments on its hanging \n\nwall show signs of a NE-SW compressive event (see Appendix 10.3). Fault F2 was reactivated as a \n\nreverse fault and deformed seismic units U1 to U5 (Late Miocene to Middle Pleistocene deposits), which \n\nsuggests the NE-SW compressive event occurred in the Middle Pleistocene. This compressive event \n\ndoes not disturb the most recent seismic unit U6 of Middle Pleistocene to Holocene age and is therefore \n\nprobably related to neotectonics on the Iberian margin. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.14 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) seismic profile CL06 with Site U1391 projected and numerous normal \n\nfaults affect units U1 to U5.

Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5.  \n\n \n\nSeismic unit U6 shows little to almost no deformation, while U1 to U5 were affected by numerous N-S \n\nsteep normal faults with variable slope, located close to the SVC, the continental shelf and the Pr\u00edncipe \n\nde Avis Seamounts (Figure 6.15). These faults that dip west are buried in the sedimentary column and \n\nrooted in the normal faults F2 and F1 (Figure 6.15). These are interpreted as growth faults which \n\ndeformed the sedimentary cover.  \n\nThe development of the SD was restricted to the west and to east by horsts h1 and h2, respectively. \n\nThus, this contourite drift developed in a north-south elongated corridor. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n   \n\nFigure 6.15 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile ST11C with numerous normal faults.

Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n\n \n\n? Horizons isobaths and structural mapping \n\nIsobath maps are depth maps, usually given in TWT units that allow for the interpretation of morphology \n\nand tectonic deformation of a selected horizon. Thus, they could be interpreted as the paleotopographic \n\nsurface prior to the deposition of the overlying seismic unit. This representation is illustrated in a colored \n\nscale, where the deeper zones are blue and the shallower zones are red. Maps for all horizons interpreted \n\nin this work were generated, including the seafloor. Isobaths maps for each seismic horizon and \n\nrespective interpretation are shown in Figure 6.17.  \n\nThe isobath map for horizon B, corresponding to the base of the SD and lower boundary of the older \n\nseismic unit U1, provides information about the preserved paleomorphology at the Late Miocene (Figure \n\n6.16). An inspection of the map allowed the identification of deeper basins to the west consisting of the \n\nRLB and the PAP. \n\nFaults PSF and F1 limit the western NNE-SSW oriented horst h1. Towards east of horst h1, faults F1 \n\nand F2 limit a graben g1 and create space accommodation, registered as elongated NNW-SSE \n\ndepressions in the center of the continental slope (Figure 6.16). This depression is observed in BS19, \n\nCL01E, and CL02 seismic profiles and reaches a maximum depth of 2578 ms TWT. The graben g1 is \n\nbounded towards east by horst h2 and by its associated fault F2 (inherited from the Mesozoic rifting \n\nepisodes). The NNW-SSE normal fault switches to NNE-SSW as it crosses the PAS. These \n\nmorphological features are also conveyed by a related structure, the Pr\u00edncipe de Avis Ridge. The \n\nPr\u00edncipe de Avis Ridge is the expression of a ENE-WSW strike-slip fault, responsible for the \n\ndisplacement of the normal faults orientation. The strike slip fault extends over 60 km and is the \n\nsubmarine prolongation of the Sines promontory (Batista, 2009).  \n\nThe isobath map of seismic horizon H2 (Early Pliocene) shows a diminution of the N-S middle \n\ndepressions, probably related to sediment accumulation of the overlying seismic unit U2 (Figure 6.17 \n\nB). The isobath map of seismic horizon H3 (Late Pliocene) follows the same trend with the near \n\ndisappearance of the central depressions. This isobath map shows that horizon H3 is still affected by the \n\npaleo-reliefs created by horsts h1 and h2 (Figure 6.17 C). \n\n\n\n65 \n\nThe isobath map of horizon H4 (Early Pleistocene) is characterized by the burial of the western horst \n\nh1. This development is visible in the seismic profiles (see Appendix 10. 3) where the deposition of the \n\noverlying seismic unit U4 covered the relief created by the horst. This isobath map starts to show \n\nresemblance with present-day seafloor morphology, with a smooth paleomorphology (Figure 6.17 D). \n\nThe isobath map of seismic horizon H5 (Early Pleistocene) is quite similar to the map of horizon H4 \n\n(Figure 6.17 D and E), with an even paleotopography.   \n\nThe isobaths maps of the younger seismic horizon H6A (Middle Pleistocene), H6B (Middle Pleistocene) \n\nand H6C (Upper Pleistocene) show a close resemblance with present-day seafloor morphology (Figure \n\n6.17 F to H). The isobaths maps display a similar evolution from horizon H6A to horizon H6C, with the \n\ncomplete disappearance of the central depressions associated with graben g1.  \n\nIn synthesis, the analysis of the precedent isobaths maps indicated that the construction of the Sines \n\nContourite Drift through time was controlled by the existence of paleotopographic features and \n\nstructures, such as the PSF, structural highs, seamounts and the SVC. The SD was deposited over the \n\nexisting paleomorphology (Figure 6.16), despite its early construction being restricted by the structural \n\nhighs (horsts h1 and h2) which implicated a higher vertical growth for the drift, with little to no lateral \n\nmigration.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 3D representation of the isobath map of seismic horizon B (Late Miocene) and main structures (5 times vertical \n\namplification).

Equidistance: 250 ms.\n\n\n\n67 \n\n6.6 Depositional evolution  \n\nThe spatial distribution of the SD deposits from Late Miocene to Holocene age was established through \n\nthe analysis of seismic units isopachs mapping, which represent the thickness in TWT units (ms) of one \n\nor more seismic units. These maps reveal the location and shape of the main depocenters and erosional \n\nareas, as well as their migration pattern and evolution through time.  \n\n \n\n6.6.1 Late Miocene \n\nThe isopach map of seismic unit U1 (Upper Miocene deposits) shows variable thickness from 200 to \n\n560 ms TWT (Figure 6.20 A). This map shows two main depocenters in the west, (D1 and D2) \n\ncorresponding to the RLB and the PAP respectively. This map also reveals the existence of two other \n\nminor depocenters, D1 in the south and D2 in the north. The southern depocenter D1 is divided by a \n\nNNE-SSW basement high. This is probably a buried horst, which controlled the area available for \n\ndeposition of the first units. Also, at the east of said structural high, the seismic units are folded as a \n\nsynform with N-S axis, as a result of compressive neotectonic events (see Appendix 10.3). Depocenters \n\nD1 and D2 correspond to the earliest development of the SD, a sheeted drift onlapping seismic horizon \n\nB (Figure 6.6). The deposition of the drift is restricted by the horsts h1 and h2, with deeper and thicker \n\naccumulation in D1 and shallower above the horsts (100 ms TWT) (Figure 6.20 A). In the northern \n\nsector, the continental shelf gains relevance and seismic unit U1 has a thinner depocenter D2 (200 ms \n\nTWT), which lines around the continental shelf with variable configuration (from NW-SE to NE-SW). \n\nThis configuration is also visible for fault F2, since its orientation goes from NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW \n\n(Figure 6.17 A to H). This deviation occurs as a manifestation of the NE-SW strike-slip fault previously \n\nmentioned, associated with the PAS. \n\nThe configuration of the margin is responsible for the SD\u2019s deepest depocenter D1 (to the west of it) \n\nwith approximately 1 km depth (Figure 6.13) and the deposition of a sheeted drift. The continental slope \n\nrelays considerable leverage over sediment deposition, since it forces the drift to develop in the south \n\nand north (depocenters D1 and D2), where there is space accommodation thanks to graben g1 (Figure \n\n6.20 A to H). The drift reaches its maximum thickness with 1612 ms TWT in an N-S elongation. Despite \n\nbeing a barrier to contourite development, a small upslope progradation of the SD was observed in the \n\nseismic profiles (Figure 6.18 and 6.19). \n\n   \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile CL11 displaying paleo-channels and paleomoats \n\nagainst the continental shelf. U1 to U6: seismic units; B and H1 to H6C: seismic horizons; FM: seafloor horizon. F: faults; black \n\narrows: reflections terminations; shaded areas: paleomoats. Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n6.6.2 Early Pliocene \n\nThe isopach map of seismic unit U2 (Early Pliocene) shows variable but overall thickening of sediments \n\nin the south (depocenter D1) and small build up over structural highs (50 ms TWT). Unit U2 was \n\npartially eroded in the north, due to the formation of a NNW-SSE elongated paleomoat, during the \n\ndeposition of the upper units (Figure 6.20 B). This suggests a N-S migration of the main depocenter \n\nthrough time, related to the development and initiation of drift formation. The construction of the drift \n\nbegun in the south sector of the map since Late Miocene and it developed vertically and towards north. \n\nThe structural restrictions channeled the MOW\u2019s pathways, thus aiding in the development of drift \n\nbodies along the SW Portuguese margin.  \n\nIn the study area, erosive features mark the construction of the SD, such as the paleochannels located \n\nsouth, near the continental shelf (Figure 6.18). These paleochannels were incised during the deposition \n\nof units U1 and U2.  The paleochannels are filled by low amplitude to semi-transparent facies, with a \n\ndiscontinuity which marks the boundary between units U1 and U2, designed horizon H2. The \n\npaleochannels mark a local increase of bottom-current strength as a result of abutting against the paleo-\n\nreliefs of the inherited structures. The deposition of seismic unit U3 sealed the paleochannels, which are \n\nthe expression of a bottom-current system at work. \n\nA current erosive channel is located north of the PSF. This channel curves over an area of 15 km width \n\nand 20 km length (Figure 6.1). This channel was carved at least since the deposition of seismic unit U1. \n\nThe formation of this channel results from the passage of bottom-currents and shows a probable \n\nalignment with PSF and F1 N-S orientation. (Figure 6.1). The channel is being carved in the lineation \n\nof the PSF, thus suggests water passage was favored by the relief created by the Pereira de Sousa Scarp. \n\n \n\n6.6.3 Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene \n\nThe isopach map of seismic unit U3 (Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene) is similar to the map of U2, \n\ndue to the thicker accumulation in D1 and the northward migration of said depocenter (Figure 6.20 C). \n\nThis unit smoothens the sharp cuts of the paleo-reliefs and, as U1 and U2, was also eroded by the \n\nformation of the eastern paleomoat.   \n\nThe isopach map of seismic unit U4 (Early Pleistocene deposits) shows a widespread thickness with \n\n310 ms TWT (Figure 6.20 D). An important characteristic is the paleomoats along the continental shelf. \n\nThese paleomoats were carved by a bottom-current, which eroded the older units (U1 to U3), in ~70 km \n\nof extension and were subsequently filled during the deposition of U4 and U5. The paleomoats are an \n\nevidence of a previous mounded morphology of the drift. \n\n \n\n6.6.4 Early-Middle Pleistocene \n\nThe isopach map of seismic unit U5 (Early-Middle Pleistocene) has 391 ms TWT thickness (Figure 6.20 \n\nE). This map shows the fill and seal of the paleomoat, which translates to a deeper depocenter D2 \n\ntowards east. Paleomoats began to develop during the deposition of seismic units U4 and U5, which \n\nextended for 70 km along the continental shelf. Seismic units U1 to U3 were eroded by the paleomoats, \n\nprior to the deposition of the overlying units U4 and U5 (Figure 6.19). The paleomoats are filled by \n\nhighly chaotic and irregular reflections and multiple erosive surfaces. The fill itself is characterized by \n\nan increase of amplitude for the internal seismic facies, separated by an erosive surface. This surface \n\ndesigned horizon H5 shows a decrease in acoustic turbidity and marks the boundary between units U4 \n\nand U5 (Figure 6.18 and 6.19). The paleomoats are wider and deeper due to higher incision when \n\nbottom-currents were constrained by morphological features (~2 km wide near the SVC; ~2.5 km wide \n\nnear the PAS).  \n\n\n\n69 \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 6.19 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile CL04 displaying the erosion of seismic units \n\nU1 to U3 with paleomoats formed during the deposition of U4 and U5.

Location of seismic profile in Figure 6.5. \n\n \n\n6.6.5 Middle Pleistocene-Holocene  \n\nThe isopach maps for the sub-units of U6 have a much higher thickness, reaching 190 ms TWT (Figure \n\n6.20 F to H). Seismic unit U6 (Middle Pleistocene-Holocene) has a fuller depocenter in the north. This \n\nunit has variations among its sub-units, due to water current variations and the incision of the current \n\nmoat (which is an extension of the previous paleomoats). Although all sub-units were deposited in a \n\nwidespread manner (following the main inclination of the SD with migration of the depocenters towards \n\nnorth) (Figure 6.20 A to H). At the present time, the SD is characterized by a plastered morphology, an \n\nasymmetric shape and a smooth western slope. Seismic unit U6 also has small paleomoats towards \n\nnortheast, 40 km long along the continental shelf (Figure 6.18 and 6.19). These paleomoats developed \n\nduring the deposition of seismic sub-units U6B and U6C and eroded the underlying sub-units, U6A and \n\nU6B, respectively. The paleomoats have a fill of high amplitude subparallel reflections (Figure 6.18 and \n\n6.19). The paleomoats suggest the presence of a semi-permanent bottom-current, which contours the \n\ncontinental shelf since Late Miocene times. These paleomoats (created since unit U4) are the precursor \n\nfor the present-day SD moat. The SD moat is carved by the northward flowing upper core of the MOW.  \n\nFrom the interpretation of the isopach maps, all units show higher deposition in the south depocenter \n\nD1, with thinner deposition in the north (depocenter D2) due to a decrease in accommodation space \n\n(Figure 6.20 A to H). Sediment accumulation is restricted by the inherited topography, such as the barrier \n\ncreated by the continental shelf. As time progressed, there was a northward migration of D1. The \n\nevolution of the Pliocene-Quaternary sequence is probably related to the MOW\u2019s passage and incision, \n\nwith the formation of paleomoats along the continental shelf and higher sedimentation for recent units. \n\nThis trend is misleading further up north, near the SC and towards southeast, near the SVC. Both \n\ncanyons do not allow sediment accumulation and provoke slope failure due to canyon incision and the \n\nsharp slant of the canyon walls.  The seismic units are also affected by multiple landslide events along \n\nthe PSF (Figure 6.21 and 6.22). Overall, the SD is characterized by a plastered morphology. In seismic \n\nunits U4 to U5, the SD had a different configuration, with mounded morphology towards south and \n\nsheeted in the north. The change from mounded to plastered is indication of a strong MOW bottom-\n\ncurrent with diminuition of its strength towards north. \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.20 A to H \u2013 Isopach maps for the main seismic units (U1 to U6C).

The Early Pleistocene-Holocene sedimentary \n\nrecord of the SD corresponding to seismic units U4 to U6 has been affected by slope failure processes. \n\nSeveral mass transport deposits were recognized either within the sedimentary column or affecting the \n\npresent-day seafloor as describe previously on Chapter 6, Point 6.1.  \n\nThe MTDs were recognized by their typical chaotic acoustic facies on the west flank of the SD and \n\nassociated with major topographic reliefs, such as the Pereira de Sousa Scarp, the PAS and the SVC. \n\nThe MTDs occupy an area of 50 km by 20 km, along the N-S PSF (Figure 6.1). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.21 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile ST11B with MTD and paleo-MTD, which \n\nhave occurred on the west flank of the SD since seismic unit U5.

The landslide \n\nscars are located between 1250-2500 m depth in a staggered succession and were identified by their \n\nasymmetric and amphitheater shapes, with variable dimensions and head scarps. These occurrences \n\nseem to affect mostly seismic units U4 to U6 deposited above horst h1 bound by the PSF (Figure. 6.21).  \n\nNear the PAS, landslides move westward in a step pattern, separated by N-NE normal slope failure \n\nfaults (Figure 6.22). This slope failure is related to the west dip of the SD and the current configuration \n\nof the seafloor morphology, with deeper basins RLB and PAP in the west.  \n\nThe SVC is another preferential site for the accumulation of several slumps and slides, probably \n\nresulting from slope instability on the southern flank of the SD. Besides that, the steep flanks of SVC \n\n(ranging between 5\u00ba and 30\u00ba) acted since Late Miocene (Valadares, 2012) as a source for gravity-driven \n\ndeposits, which have been deposited at the axis and walls of the canyon and carried further south into \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Valadares, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.22 \u2013 Un-interpreted (A) and interpreted (B) section of seismic profile CL04 shows several MTD affecting the upper \n\nunits, north of the SD.

This chapter will discuss said model, assessing \n\nthe role of tectonic, paleoceanographic, sediment supply, climatic and sea-level changes on the \n\ndevelopment of the depositional architecture shown by the SD. \n\n \n\n7.1 Depositional Model of the Sines Drift  \n\nThrough seismic stratigraphy interpretation and mapping of seismic units, three main phases of \n\ncontourite sedimentation have been identified, being characterized by different morphologies and \n\nstacking patterns: 1) sheeted-contourite-drift phase, 2) mounded-contourite-drift phase and 3) plastered-\n\ncontourite-drift phase. These phases are described herein.  \n\n \n\n1. Phase 1: Sheeted-Contourite-Drift (Late Miocene to Late Pliocene, at least&lt;5.3-3.2 Ma) \n\nThe sheeted-contourite-drift phase is represented by seismic units U1 and U2 and interpreted as a \n\nprecursor phase of contourite formation (Figure 7.1). This phase occurred from Late Miocene to the \n\nLate Pliocene, after an erosional event during the Late Miocene (seismic horizon B). This was an erosive \n\nepisode which changed the seafloor morphology of the Alentejo Basin. Although the precise age of this \n\nevent remains unknown, it could be linked to regional tectonic and paleoceanographic changes that took \n\nplace during the end of Late Miocene. Among them, are the closure and opening of the Mediterranean \n\nand Atlantic gateways (Flecker et al., 2015). The closure of the Rifian and Betic gateways at 5.96 Ma \n\nled to the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.96-5.33 Ma) (Hs\u00fc et al., 1973; Sierro et al., 2008; Flecker et al., \n\n2015). According to Duggen et al. (2003), vertical movements at lithospheric scale were responsible for \n\nthe closure of the Atlantic and Mediterranean gateways in the Late Miocene, thereby causing the \n\nMessinian Salinity Crisis.   \n\nThe end of the Late Miocene signifies the Messinian Salinity Crisis and the opening of the Strait of \n\nGibraltar (Maldonado et al., 1999; Estrada et al., 2011), which allowed the MOW to flow through the \n\nAtlantic (5.33 Ma) and cause the Zanclean flooding (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009; Estrada et al., \n\n2011). Therefore, the onset of contourite drift accumulation along the Iberia margin begins associated \n\nwith significant changes of oceanic circulation patterns (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2002, 2006; Rogerson \n\net al., 2012; Van der Schee et al., 2016) and the oldest phases seems to be well preserved on the SD.  \n\nPhase 1 was dominated by deposition of a sheeted drift, indicating that a weak bottom-current flowed \n\nnorthward. This is corroborated by the recovery at site U1391 of mixed facies with mud rich contourites, \n\nbiosiliceous muds, dolomite mudstone and a debrite, for seismic unit U2 (Table 6.2). The MOW would \n\nbe initially weak and probably flowed as a single core along the continental margin (Stow et al., 2013; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a). Therefore, a semi-permanent MOW begun flowing to deposit \n\ncontourite sediments and construct a sheeted drift, which was restricted by the paleo-reliefs (horsts h1 \n\nand h2, Figure 7.1). During this phase, upwelling events probably occurred along the West Iberian \n\nmargin, responsible for the deposition of the biosiliceous muds and assemblages of benthic foraminifers \n\n\n\n74 \n\nseen in Site U1391 (high amounts of Brizalina spp. or Cibicides/Cibicidoides spp. or Siphonodosaria \n\nspp. associated with variable amounts of Cibicidoides cf. wuellerstorfi, Melonis spp., Sigmoilopsis \n\nschlumbergeri and Uvigerina spp.; Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012). Gravity driven processes also \n\noccurred, marked by the debrite of ~35 cm thickness with muddy intraclasts and matrix (Figure 6.10 A).  \n\n \n\n2. Phase 2: Mounded-Contourite-Drift (Late Pliocene to Early Quaternary, 3.2-0.7 Ma) \n\nThe second phase of sedimentation is characterized by the development of a mounded-contourite-drift \n\nwhich is constituted by seismic units U4 and U5 (Figure 7.1). The transition from sheeted drift to \n\nmounded drift is marked by a hiatus (seismic horizon H4), small upslope migration and incision of \n\nprominent and precursory paleomoats (Figure 7.1). This change is not only seen in drift morphology \n\nand stacking pattern, from sheeted to mounded, but also in Site U1391 lithologic and physical properties \n\ndata. The lithologic character shows a shift from mixed system (debrite and mud rich contourites) that \n\ndominated Phase 1 to muddy contourites which predominate during Phase 2. Therefore, this shift reflects \n\na significant variation of the oceanic circulation patterns and its beginning was correlated to the LPD \n\n(seismic horizon H3, 3-3.2 Ma) and its ending to the EQD (seismic horizon H4, 2-2.4 Ma), recognized \n\nby Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2015).  \n\nThe LPD and EQD events coincide with a regional compression due to the reorganization of Eurasia \n\n(Iberia)-Africa (Nubia) plate boundary from NW-SE to WNW-ESSE during the Early Quaternary \n\n(Rosas et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2013). This affected the sediments in some \n\nregions, most notably in the east of the study area with the reactivation of NNW-SSE normal faults, \n\nrooted in the Mesozoic faults that bound structural highs (Figure 6.8 and 6.14). \n\nAs for the MOW, the period between the LPD and EQD marks an intensification of its strength from \n\n3.2 Ma to 2.4 Ma (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2015). The LPD event is marked by a lower sedimentation \n\nrate during the Pliocene, with 13 cm/k.y (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012), associated with the higher \n\nerosive action of the MOW. This suggests the MOW\u2019s main core flowed through in a persistent \n\nnorthward direction (Figure 7.2 and 7.3). This intensification is attributed to a prominent rise in \n\nMediterranean summer aridity, which translates to enhanced deep-water convection in the \n\nMediterranean Sea and active circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean (Kh\u00e9lifi et al., 2009, 2011, 2014). \n\nThe MOW enhancement also improved the Thermohaline Circulation, AMOC and Northern \n\nHemisphere deep-water formation due to its contribution of saline and warm waters to the intermediate \n\ndepths in the northern Atlantic waters (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a). The LPD and EQD events also \n\ncoincide with the final intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciations, marked by global cooling \n\nand sea-level fall (Bartoli et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n3. Phase 3: Plastered-Contourite-Drift (Middle Pleistocene to Present, 0.7 Ma) \n\nThe third and final phase of sedimentation led to the build-up of a plastered contourite drift from Middle \n\nPleistocene to the present-day, which is represented by seismic unit U6 (Figure 7.1). The transition from \n\nthe mounded-contourite-drift phase to the plastered-contourite-drift phase is marked by an important \n\nchange in drift architecture (Figure 6.22). The SD stacking pattern shifts from mounded to plastered, \n\nwith higher sedimentation rate at 27 cm/k.y (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012). Site U1391 data shows \n\nthat this change is marked by an increase of coarser-grained intervals and the presence of bigradational \n\ncontourite successions. Phase 3 is also characterized by small precursory paleomoats along the \n\ncontinental shelf (Figure 7.1). Therefore, this phase is characterized by the formation of a moat and thick \n\naccumulation, which suggests more vigorous bottom-currents and substantial MOW outflow into the \n\nAtlantic Ocean (Sierro et al., 1991; Flinch and Vail, 1998).  \n\n\n\n75 \n\nThe development of the present-day MOW occurs during this last stage with two phases of MOW \n\nintensification, marked by two important discontinuities: the MPD (0.7-0.9 Ma) and the LQD (~0.4 Ma) \n\n(Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2002, 2015; Llave et al., 2007b; Lofi et al., 2016). Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. \n\n(2015) attributes the formation of the MOW pathways to tectonic constriction and deformation in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. The SW Portuguese margin shows the exact opposite, with the absence of deformation \n\nand tectonic influence since the Middle Pleistocene (Pereira and Alves, 2011, 2013; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina \n\net al., 2015). The plastered contourite drift phase is not affected by deformation, thus indicating that \n\ntectonics do not play a major role in the evolution of this depositional phase. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 Representation of the depositional evolution of the SD and possible changes in MOW intensification and drift \n\narchitecture. \n\n \n\nThe first phase of MOW intensification is marked by the MPD (seismic horizon H6A), which shows the \n\nchange in drift morphology and the increase of sandier deposits. The MPD is related to an important \n\nclimatic change, the Middle Pleistocene Revolution (0.7-0.78 Ma) (Hayward et al., 2009; Hern\u00e1ndez-\n\nMolina et al., 2015). Several authors show this is the most important hiatus for the Quaternary deposits \n\n(Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006, 2015; Llave et al., 2007b, 2011; Lofi et al., 2016) which is also verified \n\nfor the SD Quaternary deposits.  \n\nThe second phase of MOW intensification is marked by the LQD (seismic horizon H6B), which is also \n\nrelated to an important climatic change at ~0.4 Ma (Hayward et al., 2009; Lofi et al., 2016). The MPD \n\nand the LQD coincide with eustatic falls of the sea-level (Miller et al., 2005; Rogerson et al., 2012; \n\nTable 7.1) and enhancement of the AMOC (Knutz, 2008). Hence, since the Middle Pleistocene, two \n\nepisodes of MOW intensification increased bottom-current strength. The second phase of MOW \n\nintensification matches one coarse-grained interval at Site U1391 in the Middle Pleistocene. However, \n\nSite U1391 has a total of six coarser-grained intervals from the Middle Pleistocene to the Present (see \n\nChapter 6, Point 6.4), which suggests at least six episodes of bottom-current enhancement during this \n\nstage. \n\nOverall, the MOW was capable of constructing the SD on the left and its moat on the right side. The SD \n\ndid not migrate considerably since Late Miocene, as the flow pathway remained almost unchanged due \n\n\n\n76 \n\nto the paleomorphologic constraints. Therefore, a long-term MOW current has consistently been flowing \n\nalong the SW Portuguese margin since that time till the present-day. \n\n \n\n7.2 Controls of Sines Drift Edification \n\n7.2.1 Structural Control  \n\nTectonic activity can influence the available accommodation space and confine drift growth. During the \n\nMesozoic, the multiple rifting phases segmented the Southwest Portuguese margin into continental \n\nshelf, upper slope (Alentejo Basin) and distal slope (Rinc\u00e3o do Lebre Basin) (Figure 7.2). The growth \n\nof the SD was constrained by the seafloor morphologies that resulted from the Mesozoic rifting \n\nprocesses, inherited from the Mesozoic rifting phases. The paleomorphologies provided accommodation \n\nspace for drift growth and conditioned its overall architecture. The N-S horsts built during the Mesozoic \n\nrifting did not allow a lateral migration and instead permitted a more vertical growth (Figure 7.2). The \n\npaleomorphologies also contributed to bottom-current acceleration. The boundary input by the \n\ncontinental slope probably aids the acceleration of the MOW current as it turns S\u00e3o Vicente Cape and \n\nflows northward. This generates alongslope current erosion and contributes for drift growth, with the \n\nMOW flowing along and eroding the continental slope. \n\nThe construction of the drift begun after a major erosive event in the Late Miocene, which affected the \n\nseafloor morphology of the Alentejo Basin. Although the precise age of this event is unknown, it could \n\nbe related to regional tectonic and paleoceanographic changes that occurred during the end of Late \n\nMiocene, such as the closure and opening of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic gateways (Flecker et \n\nal., 2015). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.2 \u2013 Model of the SD and the factors that control its depositional evolution: tectonics, paleomorphology, \npaleoceanography and slope instability. \n\n7.2.2 Paleoceanographic Implications \n\nPaleoceanographic changes can control contourite drift growth and its internal configuration (i.e. \n\nprogradation and/or aggradation). The construction of the SD was influenced by variations in the MOW, \n\n\n\n77 \n\nwhich shows distinct behavior under different climatic and eustatic conditions and under different \n\nbottom-current regime in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. \n\nThe deposition of contourites on the GCCDS only occurred after the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, \n\nwhen the interaction between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean was rekindled. The Messinian Salinity \n\nCrisis affected the Mediterranean between 5.96 and 5.33 Ma (Cita, 2001; Bache et al., 2012) and had \n\ndrastic consequences for the bottom-current circulation between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. \n\nThe Messinian Salinity Crisis occurred as a result of the closure of the Rifian and Betic gateways at 5.96 \n\nMa (Hs\u00fc et al., 1973; Sierro et al., 2008; Flecker et al., 2015) due to tectonic movements between the \n\nEurasian and the African plates (Duggen et al., 2003). This led to the progressive isolation of the \n\nMediterranean region and caused desiccation and precipitation of massive evaporites (Krijgsman et al., \n\n1999). \n\nThe end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis occurred near the Early Pliocene with the Zanclean flood, which \n\nwas the inundation of the Mediterranean Basin by Atlantic waters (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009). \n\nThere is a general agreement that the circulation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean was fully \n\nestablished in the Early Pliocene, allowing the MOW to flow along the Iberian margin and interact with \n\nthe seafloor to create contourite sheeted drifts.  \n\nTherefore, the first phase of the SD, which is characterized by the formation of a sheeted drift since the \n\nLate Miocene, suggests the existence of enhanced bottom-current circulation to aid the incipient MOW \n\nwith the deposition of contourites.  \n\nSeveral works show that humid climate conditions prevailed in the Mediterranean until 3.4 Ma (B\u00e9thoux \n\nand Pierre, 1999), until it changed to cold and arid, which triggered enhanced production of cooler, \n\nsaltier and oxygenated Mediterranean deep water (Hayward et al., 2009; Kh\u00e9lifi et al., 2009). The first \n\nphase of development of the SD is also characterized by assemblages of benthic foraminifers in a \n\ncarbonated biogenic system (in the Late Pliocene at Site U1391), which marks the occurrence of \n\nupwelling events on the Southwest Portuguese margin. At the present time, upwelling events usually \n\noccur over the continental shelf and slope of the West Portuguese margin in the summer and carry cold \n\nnutrient-rich NACWp in the north and colder nutrient-poor NACWt in the south (Mason et al., 2006). \n\nDuring the Early to Late Pliocene times, there were warmer waters in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, \n\nalthough upwelling events also occurred under similar oceanographic conditions to today\u2019s (Dowsett et \n\nal., 1996, 1999; Silva et al., 2008).  \n\nThe transition to the Quaternary is characterized by the development of a mounded drift since 3.2 Ma \n\nand a plastered drift since 0.7 Ma, with erosional contourite features (moats and paleomoats). The \n\nformation of these features is associated with several events of MOW intensification and climatic and \n\neustatic fluctuations (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2002, 2015; Llave et al., 2007b; Lofi et al., 2016).  \n\nThe location of the moats/paleomoats allowed the reconstruction of the MOW\u2019s pathway along the \n\nSouthwest Portuguese margin, from the Early Quaternary to the Present (Figure 7.3). It is possible to \n\nobserve that the MOW remained in a persistent and semi-permanent pathway towards north and along \n\nthe contours of the upper continental slope. The constant pathway of the MOW is probably related to \n\nthe paleomorphology of the Alentejo margin, which was inherited from the Mesozoic rifting phases.  \n\nIn the past, the MOW flowed as a single core along the South and West Iberian margin. Therefore, it is \n\nnot possible to recreate or separate the pathways of the MOW\u2019s Upper Core (MU) from the MOW\u2019s \n\nLower Core (ML).  \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \nFigure 7.3 \u2013 Reconstruction from the Early Quaternary (MOW*) to the Present (MOW) of the paleoceanographic pathways of \n\nthe MOW along the SW Portuguese margin, inferred by the seafloor morphology and moat/paleomoats formed since seismic \n\nunits U4 to U6 (Early Quaternary to Holocene age).

In general, the sediment \n\nsupply by bottom-currents must be greater than background pelagic and hemipelagic accumulation for \n\ncontourite development to occur (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). Bottom-currents are capable of \n\nreworking and transporting sediments, so sediment influx can be provided by turbidity currents, pro-\n\ndelta plumes, slope spillover, hemipelagic and pelagic settling both upstream, downstream and directly \n\nat the drift\u2019s location (Stow et al., 2008).  \n\nBottom-currents are capable of eroding the continental slope and reworking previously deposited \n\nsediments. Therefore vigorous and persistent bottom-currents are required for the deposition of \n\ncontourites and particularly contourite sands (Stow et al., 2008). Not only are strong bottom-currents \n\nrequired, but their persitence over geological timescales is imperative for any significant thickness to \n\naccumulate. Also, sediment influx, distance and type of transportation plays a major role for contourite \n\ndeposition (Stow et al., 2008; Figure 7.4). For example, larger grain size sediments can have a higher \n\nbiogenic component, such as foraminifera, which are significantly lighter than clasts, and require lower \n\nvelocities for transportation (McCave, 1984), and fine-grained sediments (mud or silt) could be \n\n\n\n79 \n\ndeposited by pelagic settling, since contourites have a combination of sediments sourced by alongslope, \n\ndownslope and pelagic or hemipelagic processes (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008).  \n\n \n\nThe sediment supply for the edification of the SD was inferred based on the lithological character and \n\nphysical properties at Site U1391 and the paleomorphology of the SW Portuguese margin.  \n\nThe lithological record at Site U1391 showed a predominantly calcareous mud rich facies (Figure 6.8 \n\nin Chapter 6). The mud-dominated contourites have interbedded pelagic and hemipelagic muds, since \n\nthese processes can occur at the same time. The first phase of contourite drift deposition (Late Pliocene) \n\nwas characterized by a mixed system at Site U1391, composed of fine-grained sediments (mainly \n\ncalcareous and biogenic components) with a debrite and a dolomitic mudstone, with low amplitude \n\nreflections in the seismic data (seismic units U1 to U3; Figure 6.7). These characteristics suggest a low \n\nenergy system, with almost no gradational successions and multiple ongoing depositional processes, \n\nwith interbedded sediments derived both from downslope and alongslope.  \n\nThe second phase (mounded-contourite-drift, from the Late Pliocene to the Early Quaternary) was \n\nmarked by muddy contourites and calcareous muds (Figure 6.10 C). During this stage, the formation of \n\na mounded drift with a succession of paleomoats was probably associated with intensification of the \n\nMOW from the Late Pliocene to the Early Quaternary. This observation does not take into account the \n\ngrain size of the sediments which fill the paleomoats, since Site U1391 is located on the center of the \n\nstudy area. Although, it is possible to speculate that the paleomoats probably hold coarser-grained \n\nsediments (marked by low to high amplitude reflections in seismic units U4 and U5) as a result of \n\nenhanced bottom-current velocity.  \n\nThe transition to the plastered-contourite-drift stage in the Middle Pleistocene is marked by a change in \n\nsedimentation. This is testified by an increase to six sandy contourite layers and numerous bigradational \n\ncontourite successions of calcareous and siliciclastic natures (Figure 6.10 C in Chapter 6). On seismic \n\ndata, this phase has high amplitude reflections (seismic unit U6), which reflects the coarse-grained \n\nnature of the sediments. This phase is also characterized by a cyclic pattern of transparent facies with \n\nthick reflective facies at the top and minor erosional surfaces (Figure 6.14). This variation is probably \n\ncorrelated with the alternations from fine- to coarse-grained contourite deposits and the bigradational \n\ncontourite successions. The alternations could indicate periods of strengthening and waning bottom-\n\ncurrent velocity and probably result from climatic and sea-level changes, observed mainly since the \n\nMiddle Pleistocene. This shows sediment supply has varied at numerous timescales, with variations of \n\nsediment grain size as a result of bottom-current fluctuations. Therefore, in the SD a relation exists \n\nbetween bottom-current velocity and average grain size.  \n\nThe relation between sediment input and bottom-currents for the SD should also consider the Gulf of \n\nCadiz Contourite Depositional System (GCCDS), since the SD is formed by the MOW, which comes \n\nfrom the Strait of Gibraltar.  \n\nThe GCCDS is characterized as a silici-bioclastic system since the Early Pliocene to the Present, with \n\nmean grain sizes of 6 \u00b5m to ~1000 \u00b5m (Brackenbrige, 2014; Alonso et al., 2016; Nishida et al., 2016). \n\nThe GCCDS is characterized by a reduction of grain size away from the Strait of Gibraltar (Stow et al., \n\n2013; Figure 7.4) and away from the main bottom-currents (Nelson et al., 1993; Brackenridge, 2014; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a). This CDS also has a broad relation between the accumulation of \n\ncoarse-grained sediments in zones of bottom-current acceleration (channels, valleys) or in zones of \n\nbottom-current deceleration (exit of a channel) (Stow et al., 2013; Figure 7.4).  Also, shelf spillover \n\nplays an important role in the GCCDS, with sand spilling off the shelf closer to the Strait of Gibraltar \n\nand being entrained into the MOW (Stow et al., 2013; Brackenridge, 2014; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n\n\n\n80 \n\n2014a; Ducassou et al., 2015; Figure 7.4). This sand can be transported alongslope for many kilometers \n\nbefore being deposited.  \n\nThe SD is constituted by a mixed carbonated-bioclastic system from the Late Pliocene to the Present, \n\nwith a higher siliciclastic component for the plastered-contourite drift stage from the Mid-Pleistocene \n\ntill the present-day. The difference between the SD carbonated-bioclastic system and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nsilici-bioclastic system is probably related to the location of the SD, which slightly changes the main \n\nprocesses involved in sediment deposition. The difference also implicates different clast transport \n\nthresholds and a different response to bottom-current fluctuations. Although the change in the SD from \n\na carbonated-bioclastic system to a more siliciclastic occurrence denotes the existence of bottom-current \n\nvariations and enhancements. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.4 \u2013 Actual sand distribution across the Gulf of Cadiz. Brackenridge (2014) modified from Nelson et al. (1993).  \n\n \n\n7.2.4 Climatic Fluctuations \n\nAs previously mentioned, contourite formation is associated with intensifications and variations of \n\nbottom-currents (Stow et al., 2008, 2009). Bottom-current strength and velocity controls drift \n\nmorphology and facies, in addition to the erosion or deposition of the seafloor. Bottom-currents need to \n\nbe stable and semi-permanent to have effective re-working, transportation and deposition of sediments. \n\nVelocities at > 0.1 ms-1 establish this premise and velocities &lt;0.5 ms-1 force seafloor erosion and non-\n\ndeposition (Stow et al., 2009). This variation of velocities translates to long or short-term cyclicity in \n\nthe seismic facies. The cyclicity has been interpreted as related to climatic and sea-level changes, which \n\ninduce bottom-current fluctuations.  \n\nThe conventional depositional model usually shows second- and third-order changes of sea-level (1-10 \n\nMa duration), while parasequences show third- and fourth-order changes (100 ky to 1 Ma duration), and \n\ninternal variations of the successions reflect higher frequency (10 to 100 ky intervals) (Myers and \n\n\n\n81 \n\nMilton, 1996). Drift systems can however span two or more normal depositional successions (Fulthorpe \n\net al., 2010).  \n\nThe GCCDS was developed in the last 5 Ma due to the MOW\u2019s outflow (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2003, \n\n2006; Llave et al., 2007b). The contourite drifts of the GCCDS have cyclical facies with numerous \n\nseismic successions and sub-successions (Llave et al., 2001, 2006; Stow et al., 2002c). This cyclicity is \n\nalso observed in the stacking pattern of the SD. Therefore, climatic and eustatic variations have affected \n\nthe SD since the establishment of the MOW in the Early Pliocene.  \n\nIn the Late Pliocene, the period between the LPD and the EQD (seismic horizon H3 to H4, 3.2-2.4 Ma) \n\nmarks a major enhancement of the MOW with higher salinity and density (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n\n2015). This event is characterized by enhanced bottom-current circulation, derived from the growth and \n\nsouthward advance of ice-sheets in the Northern Hemisphere and increasing arid and cold conditions in \n\nthe Mediterranean and Atlantic regions (Hayward et al., 2009; Kh\u00e9lifi et al., 2009, 2014). These \n\nconditions triggered the formation of saltier and intense MOW and a shift from sheeted to mounded drift \n\nin the SD, with considerable paleomoat formation (Table 7.1). \n\nAlthough other influential climatic and sea-level changes also occurred in the Middle Pleistocene, which \n\ngenerated MOW intensifications. In the Middle Pleistocene, two important climatic events seem to have \n\naffected the SD depositional evolution: the MPR (0.7-0.78 Ma) and the LQD (~0.4 Ma) (Miller et al., \n2005; Llave et al., 2007b; Lofi et al., 2016). The MPR, marked by seismic horizon H6A, is considered \n\nas one of the most important climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., \n\n2014a). The MPR occurred due to the growth of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere and coincided \n\nwith a shift to longer glaciations and shorter interglaciations (Hayward et al., 2009; Lofi et al., 2016). \n\nSeismic data shows the MPR is marked by a change in drift architecture, from mounded to plastered, as \n\nwell as highly cyclical facies with high to low amplitude reflections and minor erosive surfaces (Figure \n\n6.14 and Figure 6.22). At Site U1391, the MPR is characterized by an increase of coarser-grained \n\nsediments and bigradational contourite successions. The LQD, marked by seismic horizon H6B, \n\ncoincides with a cold period in the Mediterranean region during the Pleistocene, formed by the advance \n\nof ice sheets towards lower latitudes (Hayward et al., 2009; Lofi et al., 2016). Seismic data shows the \n\nLQD is characterized by a small paleomoat and high amplitude basal reflections.  Therefore, the \n\ncyclicity of the SD seismic facies have been interpreted as a result of major long-term variations of \n\nbottom-current intensity and depth, controlled by climatic-eustatic fluctuations (Table 7.1).  \n\nThe available evidence suggests that the greatest contourite accumulation occurred during times of \n\nglacio-eustatic lowstand with sediment directly supplied to the slope from the continental shelf and a \n\nvigorous deep and dense MOW flowing along the margin. Several authors have described a saltier, \n\ndenser and enhanced MOW during glacial times, settling at 700 m deeper than today (the MOW\u2019s main \n\ncore flows at ~800 m depth in the Present and flowed at 1600-2200 m depth in the past) (Cacho et al., \n\n2000, 2002; Rogerson et al., 2005, 2012; Voelker et al., 2006; Toucanne et al., 2007; Garc\u00eda et al., 2009; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a). The enhancement of the MOW probably occurred during Heinrich \n\nevents, Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials and Younger Dryas (Sierro et al., 2005, Llave et al., 2006, Voelker \n\net al., 2006). By contrast, during the interglacials and warm-water highstands the MOW was weaker \n\nand sub-divided into several branches, with the upper branch flowing at 600-1000 m depth (Stow et al., \n\n2002c; Rogerson et al., 2005). The present circulation was established after the Younger Dryas, between \n\n7.5 and 5.5 ka (Rogerson et al., 2005, 2006; Garc\u00eda et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n82 \n\nTable 7.1. \u2013 Late Miocene to Quaternary evolution of the SD, characterized by three growth phases with distinct seismic and lithological character.

MTD can occur as a result of \n\npredispositioning and triggering factors that predispose the slope to become unstable (Leroueil et al., \n\n2005). The formation of MTD can generate other hazards, although their danger depends on their size, \n\ntype, scale, location and process (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). For example, tsunamis are a well-\n\nknown associated risk. There are historical tsunamis attributed to the formation of slides or slumps: \n\nGrand Banks, 1929; Sagami Bay, Great Tokyo Earthquake, 1923; Port Royal, Jamaica, 1692; Ishigaki \n\nIsland, Japan, 1771; Valdez, Alaska, 1964; Lituya Bay, Alaska, 1958 (Bryant, 2001).  \n\n \n\nFrom the several triggers of slope failure, we will only refer to the ones active in the study area: \n\noversteepening and seismic activity (Leroueil et al., 2005).  \n\nThe joint analysis of the multibeam bathymetry and the seismic profiles showed that the western sector \n\nof the SD is affected by slope failure while resulting MTD accumulated at the footwall of the PSF, in \n\nthe Rinc\u00e3o do Lebre Basin (Figure 7.5). The area of the SD affected by slope failure extends for over \n\n50 km long and 20 km wide (Roque et al., 2015; Figure 6.1). It was previously seen in Chapter 6, Point \n\n6.7 that the MTD occur mainly after the deposition of seismic unit U4 of Early Quaternary age. The \n\nMTD also seem to be associated with the steep slope of the PSF escarpment (~20\u00ba gradient, dipping \n\ntowards west). The steepness of the PSF escarpment seems to favor the occurrence of slope failure \n\n(Figure 7.5).  \n\nThe eastward extension of the SD is not significantly affected by downslope processes (notwithstanding \n\nthe debrite of ~0.35 m in the Late Pliocene at Site U1391) due to the paleomorphology of the margin \n\nand due to the S\u00e3o Vicente and Set\u00fabal canyons, which take most of the downslope sediment supply.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.5 \u2013 Representation of the formation and accumulation of MTD and paleo-MTD, associated with the PSF escarpment.  \n\n \n\nAnother triggering factor to take in consideration is seismic activity (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003b; Masson et al., \n\n2006; Stigall and Dugan, 2010; Urlaub et al., 2013). Instrumental seismic activity on the offshore SW \n\nPortugal is moderated (M<5) but this area has been stroked by higher magnitude events, such as the \n\n\n\n84 \n\n1969\u2019s tsunami and earthquake (M=7.8; Fukao, 1973) and the Great Lisbon Earthquake and Tsunami \n\non the 1st November 1755 (M=8,5-9; Johnston, 1996). Another important historical seismic event is the \n\n1531 Lisbon Earthquake on the 26th January 1531, which was felt on the Lisbon and Tagus margin (Justo \n\nand Salwa, 1998; Miranda et al., 2012). It is not known if these events are associated with the formation \n\nof MTD, although it proves that high magnitude earthquakes can occur in the study area and potentially \n\ntrigger downslope events (Terrinha et al., 2003). \n\nPredispositioning factors also influence slope instability, such as the properties of the sediments, high \n\nsedimentation rates, excess pore pressure, unfavorable layering or weak layers (Leroueil et al., 2005). \n\nThe joint occurrence of contourites and mass movement deposits is recognized in several geological and \n\noceanographic settings (Bryn et al., 2005; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014a,b; Roque et al., 2015). This \n\nassociation has been studied for the development of the Storegga Slide in Norway. The Storegga Slide \n\nis the largest known submarine slide with ~3500 km3 (Bondevik et al., 2003, 2006, 2012). This slide \n\ncorresponds to a collapse of ~290 km along the Norwegian margin and a movement over 500 km with \n\n>50 m/s velocity (Bondevik et al., 2003, 2006, 2012). It is constituted by deposits with average and \n\nmaximum thicknesses of 88 m and 450 m, respectively. According to Lisa (2014), this event occurred \n\nin the Holocene due to seismic activity, which caused dissociation of methane hydrates. However, the \n\nexistence of contourite sediments was considered as a potential predisposition for the submarine slide \n\n(Bryn et al., 2005). The contourites are characterized by high mud contents, plasticity and water content, \n\nand therefore might have worked as weak predispositioning layers for the slide (Bryn et al., 2005). Also, \n\nthe quick sedimentation of glacial deposits over the contourites could have caused a rapid increase of \n\npore pressure inside the contouritic sediments and the occurrence of the submarine slide (Bondevik et \n\nal., 2003; B\u00fcnz et al., 2003).  \n\nIn the case of the SD, it shows a considerable thickness (1000-1200 m) due to the paleomorphology of \n\nthe margin and a moderate to high sedimentation rate, estimated at 13 cm/k.y during the Pliocene, 17 \n\ncm/k.y for the Early Pleistocene (2.588-1.5 Ma) and 27 cm/k.y for the Pleistocene (from ~1.5 Ma to the \n\nseafloor) (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2012). This thickness would create overloading and excessive pore \n\npressure inside the contourites, overcoming the hydrostatic pressure (Iverson, 1997). The excess pore \n\npressure supports most of the weight of the sedimentary column above and reduces tension, triggering \n\nan MTD (Iverson, 1997).   \n\nIt was previously seen that seismic units U4 to U6 ranging from the Early Quaternary to the present-day \n\nare constituted by numerous bigradational contourite successions and six coarse to fine-grained sandy \n\nintervals (see Chapter 6, Point 6.4). These sandy intervals can be under excess pore pressure due to their \n\nown characteristics (density, porosity and water content) and due to unfavorable layering (dense material \n\ndeposited above less dense material or loose sand under a low permeability layer). Therefore, the \n\npresence of contouritic sediments within the sedimentary column might act as a pre-conditioning factor \n\nfor slope instability (Bryn et al., 2005; Roque et al., 2015).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n85 \n\nCHAPTER 8 \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThis work proposed an evolutionary model for the Sines Drift as well as the identification of its main \n\ndriving mechanisms and constraints. The main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: \n\n? Seismic stratigraphy interpretation of a newly acquired seismic reflection dataset on the Sines \n\nContourite Drift allowed the identification of six seismic units (U1 to U6) from Late Miocene \n\nto Holocene age: the Late Miocene unit (U1) overlaying the B unconformity; the Pliocene to \n\nEarly Quaternary units (U2 and U3) characterized by a mixed system; the Early to Mid-\n\nPleistocene units (U4 and U5) marked by muddy contourites and severe paleomoats along the \n\neast; and the Mid-Pleistocene to Holocene unit (U6) characterized by interbedded sandy-muddy \n\ncontourites and moats; \n\n? Three evolutionary phases are identified for the SD development: 1) a sheeted-contourite-drift \n\nphase (<5.3-3.2 Ma) built since the Late Miocene by an initially weak flowing MOW; 2) a \n\nmounded-contourite-drift phase (3.2-0.7 Ma) from Late Pliocene to Early Quaternary times \n\ncharacterized by a mounded drift in the south and sheeted in the north, with a succession of \n\nsinuous N-S paleomoats in the east built as a result of MOW enhancement; and 3) a plastered-\n\ncontourite-drift phase from Mid-Pleistocene (0.7 Ma) till the present-day, characterized by the \n\npresent depositional (sandy-muddy drifts) and erosional (moats) contourite features associated \n\nwith two major events of MOW intensification; \n\n? The growth of the Sines Drift was constrained, in a long-term, by seafloor morphologies that \n\nresulted from the Mesozoic rifting processes of the Southwest Portuguese margin. The \n\npaleomorphology provided ample accommodation space for drift growth and conditioned its \n\noverall architecture. The N-S horsts (h1 and h2) built during the Mesozoic rifting, confined drift \n\nformation and did not allow lateral migration. This indicates that past-tectonics considerably \n\nrestrained general basin geometry and contourite drift deposition and edification; \n\n? The formation of the Sines Drift has been influenced, in short-term, by climatic fluctuations and \n\nsea-level changes, especially during the Quaternary. Since the Mid-Pleistocene the architecture \n\nof the drift was mainly influenced by climatic and sea-level changes instead of tectonics, since \n\nthere is no tectonic deformation during this stage and the drift presents a change in morphology \n\n(from mounded to plastered) with a higher number of sandy contourite layers (six in total), \n\nprobably related to several episodes of bottom-current enhancement and therefore associated \n\nwith climatic and sea-level changes;  \n\n? The higher thickness of the Late Miocene unit U1 may point to the occurrence of enhanced \n\nbottom-current circulation. Since the Early Pliocene, the exit of the warmer and more saline \n\nMOW from the Strait of Gibraltar into the intermediate depths of the North Atlantic Ocean \n\nprobably enhanced bottom water generation and aided the initially weak MOW to construct the \n\nsheeted drift; \n\n\n\n86 \n\n? The occurrence in the Early to Late Quaternary (seismic units U4 to U6) of a succession of \n\nstaking N-S paleomoats beneath the present-day moat suggests a persistent and semi-permanent, \n\nnorthward flowing MOW with several phases of enhancement;  \n\n? Sediment supply was mainly sourced by alongslope and pelagic processes, as well as erosion of \n\nthe continental slope by the MOW and its interaction with the seafloor. It was also perceived \n\nthat the S\u00e3o Vicente and Set\u00fabal canyons took most of the downslope sediment supply since \n\nthey bound the drift to the south and north, respectively; \n\n? The occurrence of mass-movement processes in the west is mainly associated with the steep \n\ngradient of the Pereira de Sousa Scarp. These processes occurred since the deposition of seismic \n\nunits U4 to U6, which are characterized by sandy-muddy contourites and these sediments could \n\nact as a predispositioning factor. However, a complex mix of triggering and predispositioning \n\nfactors are at work, such as seismicity, oversteepening, the properties of the sediments, high \n\nsedimentation rates and excess pore pressure. \n\nAll these results suggest the Sines Drift had a complex evolution from the Late Miocene to the Present, \n\ncontrolled by several factors at different scales and by the interactions between them. Therefore, the \n\nbuild-up of the Sines Drift in the Alentejo margin has been controlled by a complex combination of \n\ntectonics, bottom-current circulation, variations of sediment supply, climatic fluctuations and sea-level \n\nchanges. \n\n \n\n8.1 Future Work \n\nThis work was a step forward, to better understand the evolution of the distal sector of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nContourite Depositional System in the framework of the Mediterranean-Atlantic exchanges previously, \n\nduring and after the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Hence, there is a need to investigate the questions that \n\nremained unanswered: i) how was the MOW circulation in the bottom-current system of the Late \n\nMiocene, ii) are there drifts further north, associated with the MOW or with another bottom-current \n\nsystem, iii) what is the lithology of the Late Miocene units, and iv) what is the age of the MTD \n\naccumulated along the Pereira de Sousa Scarp? In order to answer these questions, a few works will be \n\nneeded:  \n\n? New data as seismic reflection profiles and wells for a detailed chronologic and lithologic study \n\nof the Miocene sedimentary record; \n\n? A detailed microscopic and geochemical characterization of the sandy contourite layers, as well \n\nas the debrite and the dolomitic mudstone observed in the cores of Expedition 339 Site U1391, \n\nto understand their genesis; \n\n? Construction of computational models to predict the pathway of the MOW along the western \n\nPortuguese margin to investigate the formation of other distal and older drifts. \n\n  \n\n\n\n87 \n\n9.
