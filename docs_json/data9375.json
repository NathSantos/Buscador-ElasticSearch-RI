Alternatives for solvents to be \n\nused in ethanol\u2019s extractive distillation are being investigated.  \n\nThe ionic liquids are seen as a solution to many of the problems in the \n\nchemical industry in the near future, due to their excellent properties.  \n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to study the behavior of different ionic \n\nliquid \u2013 ethanol or water systems. This has been achieved through the study \n\nof two systems by ebulliometry: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and \n\ncholine chloride at three different pressures. Finally using COSMO RS, the \n\nmodeling of the experimental data was made. Are also discussed several \n\nfactors that influence the behavior of those systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\ni \n \n\nTable Contents \n \n\nNomenclature

Petroleum, the most powerful and plentiful source \n\nof energy consists on a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, that occurs in the  \n\nresult of organic remains deposition on the bottom of lakes and seas, which are \n\nundergoing chemical changes over millions of years\n1\n. \n\nThe petroleum era began about 150 years ago and easily available energy has \n\nsupported major advances in agriculture, industry, transportation and indeed many \n\ndiverse activities overvalued by human beings. Now world petroleum and natural gas \n\nsupplies have peaked and their supplies will slowly decline over the next 50 years until \n\ndepletion\n2\n.  \n\nSmall amounts of petroleum and natural gas will remain underground but their \n\nextraction will be energetically and economically not viable. Although people are still \n\ncomfortable with the security provided by fossil energy, especially petroleum and \n\nnatural gas, they appear to be slow to recognize the energy crisis in the world. Oil, \n\nnatural gas, coal and nuclear power provide more than 88% of world energy needs and \n\nthe other 12% is provided by various renewable energy sources\n1, 3\n\n.  \n\nRenewable energy technologies already exist, but more research is needed to \n\nimprove their efficiency, costs and consequently their wide acceptance and \n\napplicability. During the last decade, biofuels have emerged as an alternative to \n\npetroleum-based energy sources for some applications.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1-Consumption of fuel, natural gas, coal and lignite, nuclear and renewable energy on Europe \n\n\n\n2 Biofuels \n \n\nBiofuels are a wide range of fuels derived from biomass, which are gaining \n\nincreased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as petroleum price \n\nspikes, the need for increased energy security, and concern over greenhouse \n\ngas emissions from fossil fuels\n4\n. \n\nIn a political-economic point of view, the biggest advantage of its use is to make \n\ncountries less dependent on petroleum sources and its variations prices and availability\n5\n. \n\nAiming at reducing the European countries dependency towards petroleum, the \n\nEuropean Union (EU) has policies to implement renewable sources on the already \n\navailable energy sources, through the Directive 2003/30/EC which aims that \"member \n\nstates should ensure that is placed on their markets a minimum proportion of renewable \n\nbiofuels\u201d (Figure 2)\n5\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2- Minimum percentage of biofuel incorporation [3] \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, the strategy for the introduction of biofuels on the market is based \n\nprimarily on their blend in conventional fuels, within limits that allow their use in \n\nvehicles without requiring additional modifications to the country vehicles fleet.  \n\nBiofuels can be classified in two different categories: first and second generation \n\nfuels.  \n\n0% \n\n1% \n\n2% \n\n3% \n\n4% \n\n5% \n\n6% \n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 \n\n2% \n\n2.75% \n\n3.50% \n\n4.25% \n\n5% \n\n5.75% \n\n\n\nIt is referred as first generation fuels, fuels that have been derived from sources \n\nlike starch, sugar, animal fats and vegetable oil, such as ETBE, biodiesel and bioethanol \n\nand first generation feedstocks are characterized by the fact that only parts of the plants \n\nare used for biofuel production. These types of fuels are obtained using conventional \n\ntechniques of production and they offer the greatest short-term potentials of biofuels \n\ntoday. Although they differ in properties, technical requirements, economical aspects \n\nand potential, they contribute to guarantee long-term mobility when comparing \n\nenvironmental and social costs with conventional fuels\n1, 6\n\n. \n\nIn other hand, second generation biofuels are not yet commercially available \n\nbecause their conversion technologies still need some improvement. BTL fuels and \n\nethanol from lignocelluloses are examples of this type of fuels. Some sources define \n\nsecond generation fuels as biomass-to-liquid technologies, which are intended to use \n\nlignocellulosic biomass. They have been developed to overtake first generation biofuels \n\nimportant manufacture limitations. And unlike those, second generation feedstock types \n\ncan provide the opportunity to use almost the entire plant and not only some parts of it\n1, \n\n6\n.  \n\nCurrently the most used biofuels are biodiesel and bioethanol.  \n\n \n\n3 Bioethanol \n\n \n\nBioethanol is a fuel that has different origins, such as biomass or petrochemical \n\nprocesses and its molecular formula is C2H6O.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3\u2013 Molecular structure of Ethanol [5] \n\n\n\nAlso known as ethyl alcohol, it is a flammable and colorless chemical \n\ncompound, every so often represented as \u201cEtOH\u201d or as C2H5OH. In Table 1 are shown \n\nthe most important properties of ethanol.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Properties of Ethanol [2] \n\nProperties of Ethanol \n\nDensity 0.789 g.cm\n-3\n\n \n\nMelting Point -114.3 \u00b0C \n\nBoiling Point 78.40 \u00b0C \n\nViscosity 1.200 cP @ 20 \n\u00b0C \n\nSolid State Liquid \n\nSolubility in water Miscible \n\n \n\nIt can be produced from any biological feedstock that contains appreciable \n\namounts of sugar or materials that can be converted into sugars such as starch or \n\ncellulose. \n7\nTwo examples of feedstock for ethanol production are sugar beets and sugar \n\ncane which contain high percentages of sugar. Corn, wheat, barley, rye and other cereals \n\nare typical feedstock\u2019s containing starch in their kernels. A large variety of feedstock is \n\navailable for producing ethanol from biomass that contains large amounts of cellulose \n\nand hemicellulose\n3\n.  \n\nSugars can be easily fermented and starch can be converted into sugar and then \n\ninto ethanol. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugar, though with more \n\ndifficulty than conversion of starch. \n\n. Ethanol is considered a clean source of energy not only by the significant \n\namount of heat released in combustion, but also because it has an oxygen atom, about \n\n35% of its mass is composed with oxygen. Thus, when blend with conventional fuel, the \n\ncombustion is cleaner, helping to reduce polluting emissions and it is used as an octane \n\nenhancer. Ethanol seems to be one of the most realistic options for setting up a truly \n\nglobal bioenergy trade, at least within the present decade. Use of ethanol fuel is growing \n\nrapidly as it has a considerable potential for substituting oil in the transportation sector, \n\ngiven the right conditions. To be mixed with fossil fuels, the ethanol must be further \n\nprocessed in order to remove the water contained, requiring additional fossil energy \n\ninputs to achieve 99.5% of pure alcohol\n6\n.  \n\n\n\nIt is also expected to exhibit an exponential growth provided by the tax \n\nincentives in order to reduce atmospheric pollution. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1- Ethanol Vs Petrol \n\n \n\nWhile bioethanol is one of the major biomass energy commodities, most of it is \n\ncommercialized for alcoholic beverages, for solvent purposes and industrial \n\napplications. There is a need to maximize some of the many favorable properties of \n\nethanol in order to achieve better results in biofuels market. Table 2 shows a \n\ncomparison between bioethanol and fossil fuel properties.  \n\n \n\nTable 2- Comparison of Petrol and Bioethanol properties [2] \n\nParameter  Petrol Bioethanol \n\nDensity kg/L 0.72-0.78 0.79 \n\nViscosity mm\n2\n.s\n\n-1\n 0.6 1.5 \n\nLatent Heat of Vaporization  kJ/kg 330-400 842-930 \n\nFlash Point \u00b0C &lt;21 &lt;21 \n\nCalorific Value  kJ/L 32.18 22.35 \n\nOctane Number  RON 92 >100 \n\nIgnition Temperature \u00b0C 220 420 \n\n    \n\n \n\nThe octane number measure the resistance of a fuel to self-ignition and \n\ndetonation. It is determined by comparing, under standard conditions, the intensity of \n\nthe detonation between the fuel and two reference fuels, such as iso-octane, which \n\nresists detonation, and heptane, which detonates readily. The value of octane number is \n\nthe percentage by volume of iso-octane in the iso-octane-heptane mixture that matches \n\nthe fuel being tested in a standard test engine and it influences the anti-detonation \n\nproperty of the fuel. The ability of detonation describes an uncontrolled combustion \n\nwhich puts heavy mechanical and thermal loads on the engine. So, a higher octane \n\nnumber stands for an anti-detonation fuel which permits the engine a more efficient use \n\nof the energy provided from the combustion heat.    \n\n\n\nEthanol is well known as an excellent anti-detonation additive and as an \n\nimprover of the octane when blended with petrol, because of that its octane number is \n\nhigher than conventional fuels.   \n\nTable 2 also shows that, the calorific value of ethanol and petrol are different. \n\nDue to this difference, the energy yield of ethanol is one third lower than petrol. The \n\nenergy of petrol is 32.5 MJ/L and 21.2 MJ/L for ethanol. For a better explanation, one \n\nliter of ethanol only replaces 0.65 liters of petrol.  \n\nAnother and important fuel property is its volatility. To perform a correct \n\ncombustion, the fuel needs to be perfectly mixed with air. Although petrol has a higher \n\ncalorific number, ethanol has a higher vapor pressure and, consequently, ethanol \n\nvaporizes more readily than conventional fuel and the resultant combustion is superior \n\nwhen it is utilized ethanol or blends composed with ethanol and petrol.   \n\nEthanol is thus, and regardless of the production process, an exceedingly good \n\nalternative to petrol use.  \n\n \n\n3.2- Extraction processes of Ethanol \n\n \n\n According to the literature, in 1994 the world production capacity for synthetic \n\nethanol was about 2.6 million of tons per year and the major producer was USA. The \n\nproduction of ethanol by fermentation from agricultural products was just about 4 300 \n\n000 tons per year in the same country. Nowadays, it is produced about 12.9 million tons \n\nper year of bioethanol and the major producer country is Brazil, followed by India and \n\nthen USA.  \n\nFormerly, ethanol was manufactured from ethylene by two ways: indirect \n\nhydration by addition of sulfuric acid and subsequent saponification of the sulfuric acid \n\nester; and direct catalyst hydration. In the first method of production, the selectivity of \n\nethanol is about 86% and in the second one is around 97%.  \n\nIn order to produce ethanol from biomass, basically there are three different \n\nprocesses: corn-to ethanol, basic lignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol and integrated \n\nlignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol. \n8\n \n\nIn the corn to-ethanol biorefinery, there are two major processes: the dry-grind \n\nand the wet mill. The first is a conventional method to obtain ethanol and consists of \n\n\n\ngrinding, cooking, liquefaction, saccharification of the starch to sugars with enzymes, \n\nfermentation of the sugars to ethanol followed by distillation and dehydration \n\nprocesses.\n8-9\n\n  \n\nThe wet mill process consists on a pre-processing prior to fermentation to \n\nethanol and it can produce high-value co-products such as fibers, germ and gluten. \n\nConsequently, it is a more expensive and energy intensive process.\n8\n \n\nThe lignocellulosic biomass to- ethanol process can be a more promising and \n\neffective alternative. Processes of this type have a great potential as a net fossil fuel \n\ndisplacement because they contribute positively to a better environment, because of the \n\ndiminished greenhouse emissions.\n8\n  \n\nAn integrated lignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol process is a new concept based \n\non the existing pulp mills. It is possible to obtain fuel at the same time as chemicals. In \n\nthis process, the short fiber of cellulose is converted into ethanol and the long fiber into \n\nmaterials for paper production or materials such as bio-composites. All the feedstocks \n\ncomponents are used to produce value-added multiple co-products, including energy, as \n\nthe concept of biorefinary.\n8-9\n\n \n\nIn spite of all the advantages, these last processes are still not available in the \n\nindustry due to existing technical, economic and commercial barriers.  \n\nAlthough, ethanol is an exceedingly good fuel alternative, the separation of \n\nan aqueous mixture of ethanol /water is often mentioned as a problem for the \n\nadoption of ethanol fuel. It presents an azeotrope at xethanol?0.894 which difficult the \n\nobtainment of high purity alcohol, as shown in figure 4.    \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSo in order to solve this dilemma, the need to discover a viable alternatives to \n\ndistillation is the mainly issue.  \n\n \n\n4 Distillation \n\n \n\nDistillation is a separation process based in vapor-liquid equilibrium of \n\nmixtures.\n8\n It separates two or more liquid components based on the principle of relative \n\nvolatility or boiling points. The greater the difference between their volatilities, the \n\neasier is the separation using distillation\n10\n\n. This process involves production of vapor by \n\nboiling the liquid mixture and removal of the vapor by condensation as shown in Figure \n\n5. The vapor is rich in light components and the liquid is rich in heavy components.  \n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Phase diagram of Ethanol-Water System \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOften a part of the condensate is flowed back to the still and is mixed with the \n\noutgoing vapor. To enhance mass transfer, there are devices called plates, trays or \n\npacking which role is to bring the vapor and the liquid phases into contact. The greater \n\nthe difference of the relative volatility, the bigger number of plates is needed. \n11\n\n  \n\nDistillation is the mainly process utilized for alcohols recovery, due to its high \n\npercentage of alcohol product in the final stream, about 99% ends up in the alcohol \n\nproduct stream.  \n\n \n\nIn spite of all its advantages, distillation cannot perform a complete separation in \n\nazeotropic mixtures. For the ethanol-water separation it requires additional steps like \n\nmolecular sieve adsorption or changes of the process parameters in order to reach \n\nproduct dryness.\n12\n\n To obtain a 99.5% pure ethanol, it is necessary to overtake the \n\nazeotrope of ethanol-water system. In general, for the solutions containing around 10 to \n\n85% of ethanol, distillation is a very effective process obtaining approximately 92.4% \n\nethanol in the product stream. While for mixtures with 85 to near 95.6% alcohol \n\nFigure 5 - Distillation Column  \n\n\n\ncontaining, this process becomes more expensive and requiring high reflux ratios, just \n\nas additional equipments.\n8, 12\n\n Although, the azeotrope can be eliminated by lowering the \n\noperation pressure to a vacuum condition, the alcohol is usually dehydrated to achieve \n\nanhydrous ethanol by employing azeotropic distillation, extractive distillation, liquid-\n\nliquid extraction, adsorption, and some more complex separation methods. \n13\n\n \n\n \n\n4.1- Azeotropic Distillation \n\n \n\n Azeotropic distillation involves adding a third volatile component, in order to \n\nform a ternary azeotrope mixture. It affects the relative volatility of the two components \n\nto be separated and alters the separation factor in the distillation. The third component is \n\nusually called entrainer and the most commonly used for the ethanol-water separation \n\nare benzene, toluene and cyclohexane. \n11\n\n \n\nIn this process, ethanol exits from the bottom, while water vapor and small \n\namounts of ethanol exit at the top. Then, it enters on a decanter and splits into two \n\nphases, the organic phase composed by ethanol-entrainer and the aqueous phase \n\nconstituted by water-entrainer. The first is refluxed back into the first column and the \n\nlatter is processed in the entrainer recovery column. \n8\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Azeotropic distillation process diagram \n\n\n\nConsequently, the system has the disadvantage of high energy requirement and \n\nlarge capital cost. Not mentioning the health and safety concerns about the entrainer. \n\nFor ethanol production, this method is the less used.   \n\n \n\n4.2-Extractive Distillation \n\n \n\nExtractive distillation requires for an extractive agent, the extractant. It can be a \n\nliquid solvent, or a dissolved salt, a mixture of liquid solvent and dissolved salt, \n\nhyperbranched polymers and ionic liquids. Just like azeotropic distillation, extractive \n\ndistillation adds a third component in order to increase the relative volatility of the \n\ncomponents to be separated, it uses a selective high boiling solvent to alter the \n\nseparation factor (Figure 7).  \n\nEthanol\u2019s extractive distillation is commonly carried using as a liquid solvent, \n\nethylene glycol and under specific operating conditions it can be competitive with \n\nazeotropic distillation\n14\n\n. \n\nThe purpose of the utilization of a dissolved salt is to enhance the relative \n\nvolatility, but also because the salt dissolves into the liquid, which is denominated as \n\n\u201csalt-effect\u201d. The most studied salts are potassium acetate, sodium acetate and calcium \n\nchloride. In literature, it is possible to find some studies about the comparison of \n\nextractive distillation with dissolved salts and conventional liquid extractants, it \n\nconcludes that the former is more efficient for ethanol-water separation. When it is used \n\nboth liquid solvent and dissolved salt, the extraction is also more efficient if used only a \n\nliquid solvent. \n8, 13\n\n \n\nHyperbranched polymers and ionic liquids are novel separating agents used in \n\nextractive distillation. Hyperbranched polymers are highly branched macromolecules \n\nwith a large number of functional groups. They can be manufactured by one step \n\nreactions, an economical advantage, and possess a remarkable selectivity and capacity, \n\nlow viscosity and thermal stability. \n8, 13\n\n \n\nPolymers like poli(glycerol) are used as entrainers in the ethanol-water system \n\nenhancing the separation process efficiency and selectivity, by braking the azeotropic \n\n\n\npoint. Despite some advantages, the obtained results are similar to conventional \n\nentrainers.\n8, 13\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, extractive distillation with ionic liquids has the advantage of \n\nhigh separation ability, easy operation and no contamination of the distillate due to their \n\nnon-volatility\n10\n\n. It only requires one distillation column, which represents lower energy \n\nconsumption. However, ionic liquids containing halogen anions are expensive and less \n\nstable. \n15\n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 - Extractive distillation process diagram \n\n\n\n5 Ionic Liquids \n\n \n\n5.1 Properties \n\n \n\nIonic liquids (IL) are salts with a melting point below 100 \u00baC, composed entirely \n\nof ionic species. The cation is a poorly coordinating, bulky organic component and the \n\nanion can be organic or inorganic, which difficults the formation of crystal lattice.\n16\n\n \n15\n\n   \n\nThey have been classified as process chemicals and as performance chemicals, \n\nbut also as environmental friendly and as green solvents with a wide range of potential \n\napplications. Ionic liquids have been broadly studied (Figure 6). \n17\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Evolution of Ionic Liquids [12] \n\n \n\nIonic liquids tend to have very appealing solvent properties and may be miscible \n\nwith both water and organic solvents\n18\n\n. At room temperature, they are generally in the \n\nliquid state and their vapor pressure is negligible, which allows for recovery and reuse, \n\nnot mentioning economic benefits, such as extremely low solvent loss\n19\n\n. At normal \n\nIonic \nLiquids \n\nChiral IL's \n\nBio IL's \n\nDeep Eutectic \nSolvents \n\nAmphiphile IL's \n\nProtic IL's \n\nSupported IL's \n\nPolarizable IL's \n\nMultifunctional \nIL's \n\n\n\nprocess operating conditions, they do not evaporate, raising some interest in the use of \n\nionic liquids as industrial solvents to replace volatile organic compounds (VOC) and \n\nthus eliminate a source of air pollution.\n16, 20\n\n  \n\nA large variety of ionic liquids can be created, essentially by changing the anion, \n\ncation and/or anion substituent\u2019s (Figure 7). This ability makes possible to \u201ctune\u201d the \n\nionic liquid in order to be applied as necessary, for example to separate selected \n\nalcohols from water. The types of IL\u2019s available have been extended to include new \n\ngenerations with more specific and targeted properties\n21\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Representative cations and anions of Ionic Liquids \n\n \n\nThey also are non-flammable and chemically stable. Ionic liquids can be \n\napplicable as solvents in organic synthesis, homogeneous and biphasic transfer catalysts \n\nand in electrochemistry.\n16, 20\n\n \n\nThe presence of water in the ionic liquid phase can severely influence physical \n\nproperties such as densities, viscosities and surface tensions\n9\n. The viscosity has strong \n\ntemperature dependence allowing for fast phase separation at elevated temperatures, for \n\nexample. \n22\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCations: \n\nC4mim\n+ \n\nCholine+ \n\nC4mpy\n+ \n\n... \n\n \n\nAnions: \n\nCl- \n\nPF6\n-\n \n\nTf2N\n- \n\n(CN)2N\n- \n\nIonic \nLiquids \n\n\n\n5.2 Applications \n\n \n\n Ionic liquids can be applicable in different areas such as in Extraction, \n\nDistillation, Adsorption, Gas storage, Engineering fluids and Membrane technology\n23\n\n. \n\nEnergy Storage also attempts to use them to produce electrochemical double layer \n\ncapacitors (ECDL), batteries, fuel cells and mobile energy. \n24\n\n \n25\n\n Surfactant technology is \n\nusing IL\u2019s to produce surfactants, lubricants, antistatic, anti corrosion and dispersions. \n25\n\n \n\nProbably ionic liquids most important application is as solvents in organic and \n\ninorganic synthesis, homogeneous and biphasic transfer catalysis. \n24\n\n \n25\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 Modeling  \n\n \n\n The knowledge of the phase behavior of mixtures is important for different \n\napplications, especially for the simulation and optimization of separation processes, \n\nwhere the phase equilibrium of the system must be known. The most used \n\nthermodynamic models to describe such behavior are free energy models such as \n\nNRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC. These models have the advantage of being able to \n\ndescribe polar, nonpolar and associative systems. However, NRTL and UNIQUAC \n\ndon\u2019t have the ability to predict new systems and are restricted to low pressures.\n26\n\n \n27\n\n \n28\n\n \n\nSince no UNIFAC parameters are available for ionic liquids in this work COSMO RS is \n\nused as predictive model to describe the experimental data here reported.  \n\n \n\n6.1 COSMO RS  \n\n \n\n The COSMO RS is a method proposed by Klamt and his cowokers used to \n\npredict a wide range of properties in complex liquid mixtures such as partial vapor \n\npressures, activities, solubilities of gases, liquids and solids, partition in arbitrary \n\nphases, and phase behavior such as Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and Liquid-Liquid \n\nEquilibrium (LLE).\n29\n\n  \n\nOne of its most important advantages is the fact that, in the prediction of \n\nthermodynamic data, it is completely independent of any experimental data of the \n\nregarded compounds and any group interaction parameters. Unlike group contribution \n\nmethods, such as UNIFAC or UNIQUAC, or other activity coefficient models, as \n\nMargules, Wilson or NRTL, COSMO RS does not consider the division of molecules \n\ninto fragments losing any information about intramolecular interactions. It is based on \n\nunimolecular quantum calculations of the individual molecules and uses a very small \n\nnumber of adjustable parameters.\n29\n\n \n30\n\n \n\nThe calculation process of COSMO RS considers basically two major stages.  \n\nThe quantum chemical COSMO calculations for the molecular species involved, where \n\nthe information about both solvents and solutes is extracted and COSMO RS statistical \n\nthermodynamic calculations performed in the COSMOtherm software.\n31\n\n \n\n\n\nCOSMO theory describes the interactions in a fluid as local contact interactions \n\nof molecular surfaces.  In order to quantify the released energy, it analyses the values of \n\ntwo screening charge densities (? and ?\u2019), which form a molecular contact. Electrostatic \n\nmisfit energy and hydrogen bonds are the most important contributions to the \n\ninteraction energy, described as functions of the polarization charges of the two \n\ninteracting segments, if the segments belongs to hydrogen bond donor or acceptor \n\natom.\n29\n\n \n30\n\n \n\nCosmo output provides the total energy of a molecule in its conductor \n\nenvironment and the 3D polarization density distribution on the surface of each \n\nmolecule Xi. Then this output data is converted into a distribution function, the ?-\n\nprofile, p\nXi\n\n(?), which describes the polarity of each surface segment on the overall \n\nsurface of the molecule and quantifies the interactions of pairwise interacting surface \n\nsegments. The ?-profile of a solvent S, pS(?), results of the adding the individual p\nXi\n\n(?) \n\nweighing by their mole fraction, xi. Since it is convenient to consider a normalized \n\nensemble and the integral of the ?-profile, p\nXi\n\n(?) is the total surface area A\nXi\n\n of a \n\ncompound Xi, the normalized ?-profile of a solvent, p\u2019S(?), is defined in Equation 1 \n30\n\n \n\n32\n: \n\n    \n \n    \n\n     \n\n  \n \n\n     \n\n    \n    \n\n                                                                            (Equation 1) \n\nThe most important descriptor used in COSMO-RS is in fact ?, which would be \n\ninduced on the molecular surface if the molecule would be in a virtual conductor \n\nenvironment. It can be calculated by quantum chemical calculations using the COSMO, \n\nand it is an extremely valuable for the local polarity of molecular surface. This \n\ndescriptor is the only descriptor determining the interaction energies.\n32\n\n  \n\n \n\nCosmo RS has the potential to study ionic liquids thermodynamic behavior.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 Motivation  \n\n \n\n This work aims to provide a comparative analysis of how the two \n\nthermodynamic models presented above can describe the phase equilibria of the binary \n\nsystems: ionic liquids + ethanol.  \n\n Ethanol\u2019s purification is a very expensive process and some alternatives have \n\nbeen studied. Ionic liquid binary systems are an exceedingly good alternative, not \n\nbecause ionic liquids are environmental friendly, but because they are less costly.  \n\nIn the first section, it is reported a study of two ionic liquid + ethanol systems. \n\nthe experimental data is also compared with literature data from ionic liquid + water \n\nsystems, so as to verify the adequacy of the experimental method adopted.  \n\n A comparison between the data obtained experimentally on the ebulliometer and \n\nthe prediction of COSMO RS model is made.  \n\nIn a second part several systems were studied to evaluate COSMOS RS \n\npredictive ability. The importance of different cations and anions, the chain length were \n\nanalyzed and the ideality deviations of ionic liquid + ethanol and ionic liquid + water \n\nwere calculated. Finally, the selectivity of those systems is calculated and analyzed.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nExperimental \n \n\n\n\n1 Chemicals \n\n \n\n It was used pure ethanol with 94.7 \u00b5g of water content and its molecular weight \n\nis 46.07g.mol\n-1\n\n. The Absolute Ethanol PA was acquired at Panreac with 99.5% of \n\npurity. \n\n The ionic liquids used are 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and choline \n\nchloride. The choline chloride was acquired at Sigma-Aldrich with purity superior to \n\n99%. The 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was acquired at IoLiTec with purity \n\nsuperior to 98%. Their molecular weights are 174.67g.mol\n-1\n\n and 139.62g.mol\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n2 Equipments \n\n \n\n2.1 Refractometer \n\n \n\nThe refractometer is an optical instrument used to measure the refractive index \n\nof a translucent substance.  \n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is always constant, but when light moves through \n\nany other medium it travels more slowly since it is constantly being absorbed and \n\nreemitted by the atoms in the material. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the \n\nspeed of the light in another substance is defined as the refraction index for the \n\nsubstance, Equation 2. \n\n                     \n                        \n\n                           \n                           (Equation 2) \n\n \n\nThe correlation between light\u2019s speed in two dissimilar media, vA and vB, the \n\nangles of incidence (?A) and refraction (?B) and the refractive indexes of the two \n\nmedium (nA and nB) is shown in Equation 3: \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n      \n\n      \n \n\n  \n\n  \n                                                                            (Equation 3) \n\n\n\nThus, it is not necessary to measure the speed of light in a sample in order to \n\ndetermine its index of refraction. Instead, by measuring the angle of refraction, and \n\nknowing the refraction index of the layer that is in contact with the sample, it is possible \n\nto determine it accurately. Almost all refractometers utilize this principle, but may differ \n\nin their optical design.  \n\nIn the Abbe refractometer the liquid sample is inserted between an illuminated \n\nprism and a refracting one. The refracting prim is made of glass with a high refractive \n\nindex and the refractometer is designed to be used with samples having a refractive \n\nindex smaller than that.  \n\nSince the density of a liquid usually decreases with temperature, the speed of \n\nlight in a liquid will normally increase as the temperatures increases. Consequently, the \n\nrefraction index will be superior as the temperature raises for a liquid. To achieve a \n\ngood performance, many refractometers are equipped with a thermometer and a \n\nreservoir of circulating water to maintain a given temperature. Most of the refractive \n\nindex measurements reported in the literature are determined at 20 or 25 \u00baC.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Abbe Refractometer \n\n\n\n2.2 Ebulliometer \n\n \n\n The ebulliometer is designed to correctly measure the boiling point of liquids by \n\nmeasuring the temperature of the vapor-liquid equilibrium either isobarically or \n\nisothermally.  \n\nThe equipment used to execute the experimental procedure operates at constant \n\npressure and in order to achieve a better performance was subjected to several changes \n\nand it can be seen in Figure 10. \n\nPrimarily, the ebulliometer consists in a boiling chamber, a sampling point that \n\nallowed operating in isolation, without external disturbances, and a condenser with \n\nwater circulation. The system pressure was achieved using a pump connected directly to \n\nthe vacuum line.  \n\nIn the final version of the ebulliometer, the pressure is measured by a pressure \n\nsensor Heated Capacitance Manometer 728A Baratron MKS, placed near the sample \n\ncell, with an accuracy of 0.50%. The temperature measurement is made using a Pt100 \n\nsounder with an associated error of 0.05K, immersed directly in the sample as shown in \n\nFigure 10. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Ebulliometer \n\n\n\n3 Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n  First of all, prepare an ethanol-ionic liquid solution richer in the most volatile \n\ncomponent (ethanol).  \n\n Consequently, add this solution to the boiling chamber of the ebulliometer along \n\nwith a magnetic stirrer.  \n\n Assemble the ebulliometer and turn on the agitation, the heating plate and the \n\nthermostatic bath. Set the pressure on the right value.   \n\n When the system is in equilibrium, the temperature does not fluctuate much with \n\ntime. Remove a sample of the mixture with a syringe.  \n\n Maintaining the same sample, alter the pressure and repeat the previous step. \n\nRepeat the last two steps of the procedure to all different pressure values.  \n\n After measuring all the data, add pure ionic liquid or a more concentrated \n\nsolution in the boiling chamber so as to concentrate the solution on the ebulliometer.  \n\nReproduce the previous steps for more concentrated solutions.  \n\n Read the refractive index of the samples in the Abbe refractometer at 30\u00baC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \nFigure 12 - Laboratory Assembly \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nResults and \n\nDiscussion \n \n\n\n\nThe number of ionic liquids available commercially is today more than 1000. It is \n\npossible to synthesize more than 10\n9\n according to several sources. The optimization of \n\nthe IL to be used for a particular purpose cannot be carried by trial and error. A \n\npredictive model such as COSMO-RS can be useful as a scanning tool to identify the \n\nbest characteristics of an ionic liquid. For that purpose we started by carrying a study to \n\nevaluate the ability of COSMO-RS to predict these systems. A database was compiled \n\nfrom the literature and is reported in Table 3 where are presented the references of all \n\nexperimental data that we were able to find in for the VLE of different ionic liquids with \n\nethanol and their temperature and pressure ranges.  \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Database for the experimental data obtained in literature \n\nIonic Liquid Pressure T/K Reference \n\n[C4mim][Cl] 101.3 kPa 351.44-412.6 \n33\n\n \n\n[C6mim][Cl] 101.3 kPa 351.44-416.78 \n34\n\n \n\n[C4mim][MSO4] 101.3 kPa 351.44-373.70 \n35\n\n \n\n[C4mim][BF4] 860-7600 Pa 283.15-293.15 \n\n36\n \n\n[C4mim][HSO4] 650-7870 Pa 283.15-298.15 \n\n[C4mim][Ac] 450-7870 Pa 283.15-298.16 \n\n[C1mim][DMP] 7.853-73.376 kPa 298.62-359.57 \n37\n\n \n\n[C2mim][ESO4] 101.3 kPa 351.44-402.88 \n38\n\n \n\n[C2mpy][ESO4] 101.3 kPa 351.44-385.52 \n39\n\n \n\n \n\nBased on this information, we decided to study the influence of several important \n\nfactors such as the temperature, the anion and the cation of the ionic liquids using \n\nCOSMO RS as a predictive model.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n0 \n\n1000 \n\n2000 \n\n3000 \n\n4000 \n\n5000 \n\n6000 \n\n7000 \n\n8000 \n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 \n\nP\n (\n\nP\na\n\n) \n\nx_EtOH \n\nT=283.15 K \n\nCosmo T=283.15 K \n\nT=288.15 K \n\nCosmo T=288.15 K \n\nT=293.15 K \n\nCosmo T=293.15 K \n\nT=298.15 K \n\nCosmo T=298.15 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 \n\nP\n( \n\nk\nP\n\na\n) \n\nx_EtOH \n\nT=320K \n\nCosmo T=320 K \n\nT=330 K \n\nCosmo T=330 K \n\nT=336 K \n\nCosmo T=336 K \n\nT=340 K \n\nCosmo T=340 K \n\n0 \n\n1000 \n\n2000 \n\n3000 \n\n4000 \n\n5000 \n\n6000 \n\n7000 \n\n8000 \n\n9000 \n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 \n\nP\n(P\n\na\n) \n\nxEtOH \n\nT=283.15 K \n\nCosmo T=283.15 K \n\nT=288.15 K \n\nCosmo T=288.15 \n\nT=293.15 K \n\nCosmo T=293.15 K \n\nT=298.15 K \n\nCosmo T=298.15 K \n\n0 \n\n1000 \n\n2000 \n\n3000 \n\n4000 \n\n5000 \n\n6000 \n\n7000 \n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 \n\nP\n(P\n\na\n) \n\nx_EtOH \n\nT=283.15 K \n\nCosmo T=283.15 K \n\nT=288.15 K \n\nCosmo T=288.15 K \n\nT=293.15 K \n\nCosmo T=293.15 K \n\n1 The COSMO RS prediction model for ionic liquid systems \n\n1.1 Temperature influence \n\n \n\nThe COSMO RS has shown to be an effective method to predict the VLE of the \n\nsystems measured in this work.

It is also notable that the COSMO RS \n\nis especially sensitive both to changes in the ionic liquid family as the variation of \n\nthe substituent group.  \n\nAnother important fact that can be observed in Figure 13: a) and c) is that as the \n\ntemperature increases the prediction made by COSMO RS are in better agreement \n\nwith the experimental data.  \n\n \n\n1.2 Anion and Cation influence   \n\n \n\nSo as to explore COSMO RS predictive properties, it was made a study to \n\nevaluate the influence of both cation and anion in the ionic liquids behavior. \n\nPrimarily, it was studied the influence of the cation chain length and then the \n\ncapacity to effect VLE behavior by different anions in the ionic liquid.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\na) b) \n\nFigure 14-Representation of PTx systems of ionic liquids: a) [Cnmim][ESO4]+EtOH; b)[Cnmim][Cl]+EtOH \n\n\n\n \n\nAs represented in Figure 14, the chain length of the ionic liquid anion does not \n\ninfluence significantly the results obtained by COSMO RS. In the first case, the \n\nvariation of the parameter n in [Cnmim][ESO4] does not change the VLE behavior of the \n\nionic liquid. For the [Cnmim][Cl]+EtOH system, the COSMO RS only describes the \n\nexperimental data correctly at high ethanol concentrations. Some other cases that were \n\nstudied are presented on Appendix B. \n\nThe influence of the cation adds great changes to the systems thermodynamic \n\nbehavior. So as to understand which cations are good choices as entrainers in ethanol\u2019s \n\nseparation, we chose 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation to study the effect of several \n\nanions. \n\nFigure 15 shows the predictions of COSMO RS for a wide range of anions at \n\nconstant pressure of 0.1 MPa.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - Representation of PTx diagram for [C2mim][anion]+ EtOH system at 1 atm. \n\n350 \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n430 \n\n440 \n\n450 \n\n460 \n\n470 \n\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 \n\nT\n(K\n\n) \n\nxEtOH \n\nDicyclohexylphosphinate \n\nDiisobutylphosphinate \n\nAcetate \n\nDecanoate \n\nDimethylphosphate \n\nHydrogencarbonate \n\nMethanesulfonate \n\nHydrogenphosphate \n\nToluene-4-sulfonate \n\nNitrate \n\nTosylate \n\nMethylsulfate \n\nMethoxyethylsulfate \n\nHydrogensulfate \n\nEtoxyethylsulfate \n\nMDEGSO4 \n\nOctylsulfate \n\nTrifluoromethane-sulfonate \n\nClO4 \n\nPerchlorate \n\nTF2N \n\n\n\n \n\n Although ionic liquids with anions such as dicyclohexylphosphinate and \n\ndiisobutylphosphinate present the best results, they are not easily available as acetate, \n\nchloride, tetrafluoroborate among others.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Activity Coefficients at Infinite Dilution \n\n \n\nThe ethanol/ionic liquid relative volatility is defined as the ratio of the \n\ndistribution coefficients of ethanol and the ionic liquid (Equation 4). \n\n    \n          \n\n        \n                                 (Equation 4) \n\nThe entrainer must be selected according to its volatility, selectivity, ease of \n\nseparation from the bottom and top products and cost. The most easily assessed is \n\nselectivity by determining the effect on the relative volatility of the two key components \n\nadding a solvent.  \n\nSo as to study more correctly the influence of those the structure of the ionic \n\nliquid on the activity coefficient at infinite dilution several systems were evaluated by \n\nCOSMO RS.

The structure of the ionic liquids studied is \n\npresented in Figure 20 below.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 20 - Ionic Liquids structural formula: a) 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium Chloride; b) Choline Chloride \n\n \n\n These systems were chosen because both have a chloride anion, the [C4mim][Cl] \n\nhas a short alkyl chain as cation, and the choline chloride a small oxygenated cation. \n\nThe experimental data was obtained at three different pressure values (1000 mbar, 700 \n\nmbar and 500 mbar) to study the influence of this parameter on the boiling temperature \n\nof ionic liquid mixtures. \n\nFrom Equation 5 it is possible to calculate the activity coefficient of ethanol in mixtures \n\nof ionic liquids + ethanol to study the interactions between both species and compare it \n\nwith results of COSMO model. \n\n          \n                                         (Equation 5) \n\n  \n\n\n\n330 \n\n350 \n\n370 \n\n390 \n\n410 \n\n430 \n\n450 \n\n0.15 0.35 0.55 0.75 0.95 \n\nT\n(K\n\n) \n\nx_EtOH \n\nP=1000 mbar \nCosmo P=1000 mbar \nP=700 mbar \nCosmo P=700 mbar \nP=500 mbar \nCosmo P=500 mbar \n\nFigure 21 shows the prediction made by COSMO for the system [C4mim][Cl]+ \n\nEtOH and the experimental data obtained from the ebulliometer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n As the alcohol percentage increases the less concentrated in ionic liquid is the \n\nmixture on the ebulliometer and a lower temperature value is needed to establish the \n\nvapour-liquid equilibrium.  \n\nFor [Choline][Cl]+EtOH it was also possible to obtain a good prediction of the system \n\nbehavior by COSMO RS (Figure 22).  \n\nFigure 21 - PTx diagram for the system [C4mim][Cl]+EtOH (Experimental data Vs Cosmo Rs prediction) \n\n\n\n \nFigure 22 - PTx diagram for the system [Choline][Cl]+EtOH (Experimental data Vs Cosmo Rs prediction) \n\n \n\nIt was not possible to obtain from the COSMO RS, the data for P= 500 mbar due \n\nto an unrecognized error. Once more, as the content of alcohol increases, the more \n\ndiluted the mixture is in ionic liquid and the lower the temperature value is needed to \n\nestablish the vapour-liquid equilibrium.  \n\nIn comparison between the two different systems, choline chloride is less soluble \n\nin ethanol than 1-butyl-3-methylimidizolium chloride and the boiling temperatures are \n\nhigher on [C4mim][Cl]+ EtOH system. \n\nIt can be explained by the structural formula of the ionic liquids (Figure 20). The \n\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation consists of a five numbered ring with two nitrogen \n\nand three carbon atoms, with ethyl and methyl groups substituted at the two nitrogen \n\natoms. On the other side, choline chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt with a N,N,N-\n\ntrimethylethanolammonium cation with a linear structure.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                           \n\n  \n\n330 \n\n335 \n\n340 \n\n345 \n\n350 \n\n355 \n\n360 \n\n365 \n\n370 \n\n0.87 0.92 0.97 \n\nT\n (\n\nK\n) \n\nx_EtOH \n\np=1000 mbar \n\nCosmo P=1000 mbar \n\np=700 mbar \n\nCosmo P=700 mbar \n\np=500 mbar \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nConclusions \n \n\n\n\n The main objective of this thesis is to evaluate ionic liquids as potential solvents \n\nfor the extractive distillation of ethanol.  \n\nTwo ionic liquid + ethanol systems were studied: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium \n\nchloride and choline chloride. Their VLE was measured in an ebulliometer and this \n\ndata, along with data from the literature was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the \n\nCOSMO RS model. COSMO RS describe adequately the experimental data.  \n\nBy applying the COSMO-RS model to other literature data it was found that it is \n\na good predictive model capable of describing the VLE data available in the literature \n\nand thus to be used as a tool in the selection of ionic liquids as entrainers for extractive \n\ndistillation. \n\nDue to the very large number of potential ionic liquids their experimental \n\nselection is difficult and time consuming. For investigating the influence of ionic liquids \n\non the separation of ethanol-water, the selectivities based on the infinite dilution activity \n\ncoefficients were estimated.  \n\nIt was found that ionic liquids with cations with shorter alkyl chains have a \n\nhigher affinity for ethanol than cations with longer alkyl chain. The presence of oxygen \n\nin cations, especially in small cations, contributes to increase the affinity between \n\nethanol and the IL. Regarding the anions, oxygen anions such as the acetate have better \n\naffinity with the ethanol.  \n\nConcerning the selectivity, anions such as dicyclohexylphosphinate (1), \n\ndiisobutylphosphinate (2), acetate (3), decanoate (4), etoxyethylsulfate (14) and chloride \n\n(21) are good choices for the extractive distillation with ionic liquids. However, the \n\nacetate (3) anion has the most significant ability in enhancing the relative volatility. \n\nDicyclohexylphosphinate (1), diisobutylphosphinate (2) have the ability to enhance the \n\nrelative volatility either, followed by decanoate (4), hydrogencarbonate (5) and \n\nhydrogensulfate (13). Bis-1-hexyl-oxymethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium cation (27) is a \n\nbetter option as an entrainer, because it has the higher selectivity value followed by \n\nHexyl-3-hydroxyethyldimethylammonium (24). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nReferences \n \n\n\n\n1.
