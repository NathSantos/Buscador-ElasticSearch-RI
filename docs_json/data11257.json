Bragan\u00e7a, Eduardo P. Fiuza &amp; Rafael P. de Morais\n\n\n\nWhy Auctions?\n\n\u2022 Conceptually, auction is the recommended \nmechanism employed to allocate resources when \ndealing with assymmetric information on the value \nof the object, considering both the regulator and \nthe potential players;\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, oil and gas exploration and production \ncontracts are auctioned since the Constitutional \nAmmendment 9/1995 and the Law 9478/1997.\n\n\n\nContributions of Auction Theory\n\n? The important issues in auction design are the \nsame as the ones in competition policy: to avoid \ncollusion, predation, entry-deterring behaviour, \nexcessive concentration of market power \n(Klemperer, 2001);\n\n? Hence, from the public policy perspective, to \nidentify the auction design that mitigate these \nproblems is a crucial objective.\n\n\n\nThe Revenue Equivalence Theorem\n\n\u2022 Starting point of Auction Design Theory: how violations of the \nRevenue Equivalence Theorem matter;\n\n\u2022 This theorem states that there is no sistematic advantage in any \nmechanism design (the set of rules that governs the interaction \namong the parts);\n\n\u2022 According to the basic model (independent private values), any \nsingle-stage or multi-stage game for allocating the unit among \nthe n bidders will yeld the same expected payment by each \nbidder and the same expected revenue for the auctioneer;\n\n\u2022 For an important set of auctions and environments, the average  \nrevenues and pays-offs of the bidders are exactly the same \n(Milgrom, 2004)\n\n\n\nWhen the Irrelevancy Theorem is violated by reality\n\n\u2022 In the real world, different auction models, depending on \nthe specific situatios seem to generate different incentive \nstructures and hence yield different results;\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no such a thing as \u201cone size fits all\u201d in auction \ndesign \u2013 with empirical studies we realize that design \nmatters (\u201cGood auction design is not one size fits all and \nmust be sensitive to the details of the context\u201d Kemperer, \n202);\n\n\u2022 Even when there is a good understanding of the economic \nenvironment before the auction, the behaviour of the \nplayers cannot be treated as perfectly predictable (Milgrom, \n2004)\n\n\n\nThe auction objectives\n\n\u2022 The trade-off between objectives \u2013 eficiencies or revenue \u2013\nis conceptually solved by Auction Theory, as both objectives \ntend to converge:\n\n\u2013 Players that atribute higher value to the auctioned object \ntend to be the most capable of generating value;\n\n\u2013 However, when market power is incorporated into the \nanalysis, the coincidence of the goals of \nincreased revenue generation and efficiency is \ncompromised: higher bids for a player with market \npower may reflect its ability to raise prices, and not its \nproductive efficiency.\n\n\n\nStill the auction objectives\n\n\u2022 Private values vs common values\n\n\u2013 The first depends on the parties\u2019 individual information and \nvaluation over the object; the former depends on the real value of the \nobject being the same to all the players (real world auctions mix \nprivate and common values);\n\n\u2022 Oil and Gas auctions are typical examples of auctions of common \nvalues\n\n\u2013 The quantity and the international price will be the same \nindependent of the winner;\n\n\u2013 In this environment, with few and big players, there is high risk of \ncollusion;\n\n\u2013 When assimetry of information is introduced in this environment, we \nface the risk of winner\u2019s curse.\n\n\n\nStill the auction objectives\n\n\u2022 Some questions should be raised, but are frequently \nommited:\n\n\u2013 The auctionned object has been alocated  in an efficient \nway?\n\n\u2013 Do the auction rules promote competition?\n\n\u2013 Does the auction promote dynamic competition, in the \nsense that it promotes the entry of new players, or at least \ndo not generate entry barriers?\n\n\u2013 Does the auction promote small firms? \n\n\u2022 (Kemperer, 2000)\n\n\n\nEmpirical evidence of winner\u2019s curse: the US case\n\n? Hendricks and Porter (1988), Hendricks, Porter and Wilson \n(1994) exploits the availability of ex post values to test equilibrium \nbidding models in common value environments with asymmetric \ninformation using drainage tract data;\n\n? Drainage tracts are adjacent to tracts where oil and gas deposits have \nbeen found. The firms owning the adjacent tracts, called \u201cneighbour\u201d \nfirms, have superior information to non-neighbours about tract value;\n\n? The key feature of competitive bidding between informed and \nuninformed firms in first-price, common value auctions is that the \nlatter participate, but their number is essentially irrelevant to the \ninformed firm;\n\n? Since neighbour firms could be identified, and because they behaved as \na consortium, it was possible to test the theory by comparing the \nbidding behaviour and the ex post profits of neighbour firms and non-\nneighbours. \n\n\n\nEmpirical evidence of winner\u2019s curse: the US case\n\n? Hendrick, Pinkse and Porter (2003) conclude that the \n\u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d is evident in the data and that the bidders are \naware of its presence and bid accordingly;\n\n? Bidding behaviour appears to be largely consistent with a \nsymmetric CV environment, given our measure of potential \ncompetition and our measure of ex post returns;\n\n? Hendrick, Pinkse and Porter (2008) show that the trading \ninefficiency caused by the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d can be an \nimportant obstacle to collusion in auctions of common value \nassets with a binding reserve price or ex post investment.\n\n\n\nExperimental research on common value \nauctions\n\n? Experimental research on CVAs has focused on the \nwinner's curse: Kagel (1995), Avery and Kagel (1997), \nKagel and Levin (2008), Levin, Kagel, and Richard \n(1996), Rose and Levin (in press), Rose and Kagel (in \npress);\n\n? The bottom line of these studies is that they confirm \nthe problem of Winer\u2019s Curse, but put in evidence the \ndifference in magnitude, depending on the auction \ndesign.\n\n\n\nExperimental research in colusion\n\nIncreasingly large experimental literature on the \nsubject: Goswami, Noe and Rebello (1996), \nSherstyuck (2002), Phillips, Menkhaus, and Coatney \n(2003), Sade, Schnitzlein, and Zender (2005) Li and \nPlott (2005), Offerman and Potters (2006), Brown, \nKamp, and Plott (2007) and Kwasnica and Sherstyuk \n(in press).\n\n\n\nExperimental research in colusion\n\n? All of the auctions considered here involved the same set of \nsubjects competing in a series of auctions, usually with an \nunannounced end point;\n\n? Repetition with the same cohort appears to be a key \n(collusion) facilitating factor, a factor likely to be at play in \nfield settings as well;\n\n? Communication between bidders reliably facilitates \ncollusion (hardly surprising). As Whinston (2006) notes \nthere is little in formal economic theory about the way in \nwhich prohibitions on (nonbinding) price agreements \nprevent anticompetitive prices, with the published \nempirical work offering surprisingly little evidence that \npreventing oligopolists from talking has a substantial effect \non the prices they charge.\n\n\n\nExperimental research in colusion\n\n? Sealed-bid, pay what you bid type auctions are more \ncollusion-proof than ascending price auctions, which \nprovide easier opportunities to detect and punish \nnon-cooperators; Competitive pressures seem to play \na role as well as suggested by the role played in \nbreaking up collusion in LP and the role played (in \nthe form of the support from which values were \ndrawn) in Sherstyuk (2002).\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned with our experience with oil and \ngas auctions so far in Brazil?\n\n\u2022 Rules for the eight rounds of auctions that already took \nplace:\n\u2013 First-price, sealed bid auction with multiple goals (blocks);\n\n\u2013 A mix of simultaneous and sequential auctions \u2013 bids of one \nplayer to a set of blocks belonging to the same sector are gathered \nin one sealed bid auction;\n\n\u2013 Only after the results of the auctions for one sector is known, the \nprocess of the following block begins (sequential auction) \n\n\u2013 Bidding in packs are not allowed (for different blocks)\n\n\u2013 The process is public and transparent, allowing for \nthe organization of consortia, with or without the participation \nof the incumbent company(Petrobras).\n\n\u2013 In the 8th round a restriction rule was introduced to the maximum \nnumber of blocks won by participants.\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned with our experience with oil \nand gas auctions so far?\n\n\u2022 In all the rounds, Petrobras\u2019 participation was very expressive, \nvarying between 38 and 84,1% of the auctioned areas. The firm\u2019s \nsuccess rate varied between 71,4% and 98,8% (rate tended to \nincrease with each round);\n\n\u2022 How to explain that success rate? \u201cThe predominance \nof offshore activity, the expertise of Petrobras and the relatively short \ntime of opening\u201d (Costa, Pastoriza e Prates, 2005) explains a great \npart of it.\n\n\n\nWhat Theory of Auction would say otherwise?\n\n\u2022 Refer to one factor: the winner's curse.\n\n\u2022 When competing for the right to explore a field with an \nincumbent, under the rule of a sealed auction price, the \nplayers are subject to an extreme asymmetry \nof information;\n\n\u2022 Petrobras has dealt with prospective research in Brazil for \nover 50 years. Winning an auction against it is almost \ncertainly a bad deal (i.e. it means you the winner evaluated \nwrongly);\n\n\u2022 Add to that the incumbent's market power: the \nparticipants have every reason to be cautious in their bids.\n\n\n\nRecalling why the auction design matters\n\n\u2022 The design of a first price sealed auction prevents \nparticipants from obtaining signals on the true value of the \nfields, when they are not able to observe the bids of other \nparticipants;\n\n\u2022 If, on the one hand, the design minimized the risk of \ncollusion, it maximized the problem of the winner's curse, \nmaking all other participants, other than the incumbent, \noverly cautious;\n\n\u2022 Thus, sub-optimal result: although aiming at more \ncompetition we end up with less competition (and \nefficiency and revenues to the auctioneer) as one might \nexpect from the theory.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect of auction in the new regime?\n\n? In June 2010, the Brazilian Government waived Petrobras\u2019 need for \nbidding for 5 billion barrels of oil of the pre-salt layers, that will be \nobtained instead through a bilateral contract called \u201conerous \nassignment\u201d; \n\n? Moreover, with the enactment of Law No. 12,351 of December 22, 2010, \nit was determined that the pre-salt oil and gas fields will be explored \naccording to a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA); \n? In the PSA, the government retains ownership of production, and grants oil \n\ncompanies a stipulated share as compensation for risks taken, services \nrendered, initial investment, and operation and maintenance costs. \n\n? The PSA, under the aforementioned law, can be signed: \n? entirely by Petrobras, without the need of auctions; \n\n? or by a consortium that wins the auction for the area to be explored, that \nconsortium being formed by Petrobras (at least 30% of it) and the winning \ncompany(ies). \n\n\n\nWhat to expect of auction in the new regime?\n\n? The auction design becomes a main object of study.\n\n? The minimum guarantee of 30% for Petrobras will affect the incentives \nfor consortia formation and bidding performance; \n\n? This can generate new outcomes, impacting not only bids and winners, but \nalso the return for the government (as  the auctioneer and also as a bidder \nthrough Petrobras).\n\n? Because of the specificities of Brazilian PSAs, concessions and onerous \nassignment, the asymmetries between the entities participating in a \nunitization agreement \u2013 when reservoir holders have boundaries other \nthan those outlined in the contract, and have to operate the field jointly \n\u2013 also becomes a sensitive issue that requires further research.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect of auction in the new regime?\n\n? It is necessary to evaluate the available auction design \nand even propose new ones \u2013 or combinations of \nexisting ones;\n\n? It is not possible to advance by fine tune, building on \nprevious mistakes. A well-defined framework is \nnecessary to provide legal certainty to \ninvestors/bidders. Lab experiments will be crucial to \ntest different designs;\n\n? It must be pointed that the model adopted so far \nfacilitates detection and punishment (the two elements \nnecessary to make a cartel work): simultaneity in a \ngiven block and sequenciality across blocks. Plus, \nincreased winner\u2019s curse due to 1st price sealed bid.  \n\n\n\nPossible solutions\n\n? The collusion\u2019s problem in sequential auctions could \nbe mitigated:\n\n? Lots\u2019 designs which hamper the market\u2019s division;\n\n? Rules imposition(including imposition of costs) which prohibit \nwithdrawal of bids and their values;\n\n? Imposition of anonymity to the participants and/or to the bids.\n\n? The problem of the winner\u2019s curse could be mitigated \nby the design of a hybrid auction, which enables \nlearning (reduction of information asymmetry) \n\n? Sequential, ascending and open auction.\n\n\n\nThe winner\u00b4s curse is worse under the new rules\n\n? the problem of winner's curse is getting worse in the new regulatory \nframework for the pre-salt, since the share of the incumbent will be \nestablished politically (for strategic reasons);\n\n? If Petrobras had fixed 30% share, the collective information would be \ngreater, which would decrease the uncertainty of the agents and \npossibly the winner's curse;\n\n? However, assuming that Petrobras is the agent most well informed, \nwith great certainty of high profitability, the government starts to want \nto ensure wide participation in income from the block;\n\n? It is presumed that Petrobras will enter only between wells with \nminimum participation is very risky and uncertain. The rest knowing \nthat a certain victory at auction may be due to a miscalculation \n(considering that would be more uninformed) may decide on \nparticipation / bid below the optimum.\n\n\n\nPossible solutions\n\n? As we do not have empirical knowledge on outcomes \nof auction under this institucional environment, \nexperimental economics may be crucial;\n\n? Which designs will be able to mitigate the winner\u2019s \ncurse problem.\n\nthanks for your attention!\n\nlucia.salgado@ipea.gov.br"}]}}}
