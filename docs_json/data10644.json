A agricultura \u00e9 uma importante actividade na economia \n\nde muitos pa\u00edses, mas \u00e9, ao mesmo tempo, a grande respons\u00e1vel pelo aumento do \n\nconsumo de pesticidas a que temos vindo a assistir, ao longo dos tempos. Em \n\nPortugal, de acordo com o Eurostat, aproximadamente 17000 toneladas de \n\npesticidas foram vendidos em 2008, contrastando com menos de 13000 toneladas \n\nvendidas em 1997. \n\nPode considerar-se que os pesticidas s\u00e3o uma ferramenta econ\u00f3mica, \n\neficiente e racional no controlo de pragas pois, teoricamente, s\u00e3o desenvolvidos \n\natrav\u00e9s de processos de regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o muito r\u00edgidos para que funcionem com \n\nseguran\u00e7a e m\u00ednimo impacto na sa\u00fade humana e no ambiente. No entanto, a \n\nmaioria das vezes, os estudos publicados n\u00e3o est\u00e3o em concord\u00e2ncia com este \n\nfacto e surgem, cada vez mais, preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es relativamente aos riscos para sa\u00fade, \n\ndecorrentes n\u00e3o s\u00f3 da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ocupacional aos pesticidas, mas tamb\u00e9m da \n\nexposi\u00e7\u00e3o a res\u00edduos destes qu\u00edmicos, presentes nos alimentos, que v\u00e3o atingir toda \n\na popula\u00e7\u00e3o. Consequentemente, nos \u00faltimos anos, procuram-se alternativas vi\u00e1veis \n\nao uso de pesticidas e a agricultura biol\u00f3gica pode ser uma op\u00e7\u00e3o a considerar. De \n\nfacto, este tipo de agricultura n\u00e3o usa qualquer tipo de produto qu\u00edmico, sendo \n\nbaseada na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de inimigos naturais para o combate de pragas. Todavia, esta \n\npr\u00e1tica \u00e9 muito controversa, pois parece n\u00e3o ter ainda o potencial para responder a \n\numa produ\u00e7\u00e3o em massa, necess\u00e1ria para alimentar toda a humanidade. Assim, \u00e9 \n\nessencial que se fa\u00e7a mais investiga\u00e7\u00e3o nesta \u00e1rea de forma a entender as \n\nverdadeiras potencialidades, constrangimentos e limita\u00e7\u00f5es desta pr\u00e1tica, que pode \n\nser a chave para a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do grande problema do uso de pesticidas. \n\nO Mancozeb \u00e9 um dos fungicidas mais usados a n\u00edvel mundial, principalmente \n\ndevido \u00e0 sua baixa toxicidade aguda para os mam\u00edferos e escassa perman\u00eancia no \n\nmeio ambiente. Apesar disto, o Mancozeb, principalmente atrav\u00e9s de um dos seus \n\nprodutos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, a etilenotiureia (ETU), tem efeitos toxicol\u00f3gicos ao n\u00edvel da \n\ntir\u00f3ide, sistema imunit\u00e1rio, reprodutivo e nervoso. Para al\u00e9m disto, o Mancozeb \n\nparece ter actividade mutag\u00e9nica, teratog\u00e9nica e ainda carcinog\u00e9nica, tendo-se \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\nResumo iv \n\nverificado que induz uma variedade de tumores de diferentes origens em ratos, ap\u00f3s \n\numa exposi\u00e7\u00e3o cr\u00f3nica. H\u00e1 ainda a referir que o mangan\u00eas (Mn), constituinte deste \n\npesticida, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um agente mutag\u00e9nico comprovado, causando danos no \n\nmaterial gen\u00e9tico. Apesar de tudo isto, o Mancozeb est\u00e1 inclu\u00eddo na lista (Anexo I da \n\ndirectiva 91/414/EEC, 1991) de subst\u00e2ncias activas consideradas aceit\u00e1veis, tendo \n\nem conta o seu impacto no ambiente, sa\u00fade animal e humana, sendo o seu uso \n\nlegalmente autorizado na formula\u00e7\u00e3o de pesticidas dentro da Comunidade Europeia. \n\nA avalia\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental da toxicidade dos pesticidas pode ser feita atrav\u00e9s da \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pequenos mam\u00edferos roedores, que vivem nos campos, uma vez que \n\nestes s\u00e3o bons bioindicadores, acumulando um vasto espectro de poluentes \n\npresentes nos ecossistemas. Particularmente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos pesticidas, existem j\u00e1 \n\nalgumas correla\u00e7\u00f5es significativas entre exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a ocorr\u00eancia de danos \n\ngen\u00e9ticos nestes animais. Por outro lado, estes animais t\u00eam a vantagem de ter \n\ngrandes semelhan\u00e7as gen\u00e9ticas e fisiol\u00f3gicas com os humanos, permitindo a \n\nextrapola\u00e7\u00e3o dos efeitos dos pesticidas. \n\nAssim, o principal objectivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a toxicidade dos \n\npesticidas, in situ, comparando o estado de sa\u00fade de duas esp\u00e9cies de roedores \n\n(Mus spretus e Apodemus sylvaticus), provenientes de uma zona de agricultura \n\nconvencional em contraste com os de uma zona de agricultura biol\u00f3gica. Para isto, \n\nfoi necess\u00e1ria a colabora\u00e7\u00e3o dos agricultores em causa, que se mostraram sempre \n\ndispon\u00edveis, e forneceram toda a informa\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria. Assim, o agricultor \n\nrespons\u00e1vel pelo campo de agricultura biol\u00f3gica garantiu que n\u00e3o eram usados \n\nquaisquer tipos de subst\u00e2ncias qu\u00edmicas, tratando-se de uma zona que sofreu \n\nconvers\u00e3o h\u00e1 cerca de 5 anos. Da agricultura convencional foi fornecida uma lista de \n\npesticidas usados, onde os insecticidas organofosforados, carbamatos, juntamente \n\ncom alguns EDBCs eram os principais grupos qu\u00edmicos de pesticidas usados. Para \n\nal\u00e9m disto, o agricultor da zona convencional informou que mais de 50% das \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es eram baseadas num fungicida EDBC, o Mancozeb, sendo ent\u00e3o este o \n\npesticida maioritariamente aplicado. \n\nDepois de capturados e sacrificados, os animais foram avaliados do ponto de \n\nvista morfofisiol\u00f3gico, atrav\u00e9s das medidas biom\u00e9tricas, peso relativo dos \u00f3rg\u00e3os \n\ninternos e par\u00e2metros hematol\u00f3gicos. Foram ainda sujeitos a tr\u00eas testes de forma a \n\navaliar os danos ao n\u00edvel do material gen\u00e9tico: ensaio do cometa nos linf\u00f3citos, teste \n\ndos micron\u00facleos na medula \u00f3ssea e teste das anomalias nos espermatoz\u00f3ides. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\nResumo v \n\nPara al\u00e9m disto, foi feita a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade da acetilcolinesterase no \n\nc\u00e9rebro, que \u00e9 um biomarcador da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a insecticidas organofosforados e \n\ncarbamatos, e a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas (Mn) no f\u00edgado, que pode servir para \n\navaliar a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao Mancozeb, uma vez que este metal entra na sua constitui\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nFoi, ainda, iniciada uma an\u00e1lise molecular no intuito de determinar polimorfismos do \n\ngene CYP1A1, que est\u00e1 envolvido no processo de desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o de agentes \n\nxenobi\u00f3ticos, como os pesticidas. \n\nComo resultado, o presente estudo demonstrou claramente que a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\numa mistura de pesticidas, onde o Mancozeb representa mais de 50% dessa \n\nmistura, tem a capacidade de causar danos gen\u00e9ticos em pequenos mam\u00edferos, \n\navaliados pelos ensaios do cometa, micron\u00facleos e anomalias nos espermatoz\u00f3ides. \n\nPara al\u00e9m disto, de forma a provar que, de facto, o Mancozeb era o agente \n\ngenot\u00f3xico em causa, foi feita a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas no f\u00edgado dos animais, \n\natrav\u00e9s da t\u00e9cnica de Espectrofotometria de Absor\u00e7\u00e3o At\u00f3mica com C\u00e2mara de \n\nGrafite. Assim, concluiu-se que os animais de ambas as esp\u00e9cies da zona da \n\nagricultura convencional, expostos a pesticidas, com maiores n\u00edveis de danos \n\ngen\u00e9ticos, tinham tamb\u00e9m maiores n\u00edveis de Mn no f\u00edgado, comparativamente aos \n\nanimais da zona de agricultura biol\u00f3gica. Ou seja, o Mancozeb, sendo a fonte destes \n\nn\u00edveis de Mn mais elevados, ser\u00e1 o agente genot\u00f3xico em causa. \n\nPor outro lado, foi feita a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade do enzima \n\nacetilcolinesterase, no c\u00e9rebro, para despistar poss\u00edveis efeitos de insecticidas \n\norganofosforados e carbamatos, que tamb\u00e9m podiam ser a causa das diferen\u00e7as \n\nnos danos gen\u00e9ticos encontrados entre as duas zonas analisadas. No entanto, \n\nverificou-se que n\u00e3o havia diferen\u00e7as significativas nos valores da actividade deste \n\nenzima, entre os animais das duas zonas, que pudessem justificar os valores \n\nsuperiores de danos gen\u00e9ticos encontrados na zona de agricultura convencional.  \n\nFoi ainda feita uma an\u00e1lise morfofisiol\u00f3gica para verificar se os animais \n\nexpostos aos pesticidas tinham esses par\u00e2metros alterados, mas apenas os ba\u00e7os \n\naumentados foram reveladores da infec\u00e7\u00e3o provocada pela exposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos \n\npesticidas. Por outro lado, foi feita uma an\u00e1lise gen\u00e9tica preliminar, no intuito de \n\nencontrar polimorfismos no gene CYP1A1, mas n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel conclui-la e, \n\nfuturamente, ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio continuar esta abordagem molecular do estudo. \n\nTendo em conta as diferentes sensibilidades das duas esp\u00e9cies \n\nbioindicadoras analisadas, este estudo mostra como \u00e9 importante usar pelo menos \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\nResumo vi \n\nduas esp\u00e9cies simp\u00e1tricas para detectar a presen\u00e7a de agentes genot\u00f3xicos e \n\nutilizar v\u00e1rios testes de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos danos gen\u00e9ticos, porque a variabilidade em \n\nesp\u00e9cies selvagens \u00e9 bastante mais elevada relativamente a animais de laborat\u00f3rio. \n\nPor outro lado, verificou-se que, de facto, a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o do Mn, tem potencial para \n\nser um biomarcador da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e este tipo de pesticidas, que t\u00eam metais na sua \n\nconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o. Este estudo fornece ainda valores de refer\u00eancia para os biomarcadores \n\nutilizados em estudos futuros e demonstra como M. spretus e Apodemus sylvaticus \n\ns\u00e3o duas esp\u00e9cies indicadas para serem usadas como bioindicadores de polui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nprovocada pelos pesticidas. \n\nConcluindo, o presente estudo demonstra que a pr\u00e1tica agr\u00edcola convencional \n\nrepresenta um maior risco genot\u00f3xico comparativamente \u00e0 agricultura biol\u00f3gica e \n\ncontribuiu para alertar acerca dos efeitos prejudiciais que adv\u00eam da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos \n\npesticidas a longo prazo, particularmente, da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao Mancozeb, que \u00e9 um \n\npesticida de uso legalmente autorizado na Comunidade Europeia. Apesar de v\u00e1rios \n\nestudos indicarem uma elevada toxicidade do Mancozeb, este continuar\u00e1 a ser um \n\ndos pesticidas mais usados no mundo, devido \u00e1 sua efic\u00e1cia, baixo custo e baixa \n\npersist\u00eancia no ambiente relativamente a outros pesticidas. Assim, grande parte da \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o vai continuar a ser exposta e a problem\u00e1tica dos seus efeitos a longo \n\nprazo continuar\u00e1 a existir, enquanto n\u00e3o forem feitos investimentos na descoberta de \n\nalternativas ao uso de pesticidas.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPalavras-chave: Pesticidas, Mancozeb, Mus spretus, Apodemus sylvaticus, \n\nBiomarcadores de Genotoxicidade, Mangan\u00eas, Acetilcolinesterase \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\nAbstract vii \n\nAbstract \n \n\nPesticides are widely used for pest control in conventional agriculture, despite \n\ntheir negative impacts. Biological agriculture can represent a valuable option, \n\navoiding the use of pesticides, but it does not appear to have the potential to respond \n\nto the mass production of food to feed humanity.   \n\nMancozeb is a widely used fungicide mainly because of its low acute toxicity in \n\nmammals and scarce persistence in the environment. However, it has been \n\nconsidered a multipotent carcinogen, mutagenic and possibly teratogenic in a long-\n\nterm exposure context.  \n\nSmall mammals can be used as bioindicators of environmental toxicity of \n\npesticides, accumulating a wide spectrum of pollutants, and significant correlations \n\nbetween pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have already been \n\ndetected.  \n\nThe main aim of this study was the in situ assessment of pesticide toxicity, \n\nusing two small mammals\u2019 species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from a \n\nconventional agriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) zone.  \n\nIt was found that exposure to a mixture of pesticide, where Mancozeb \n\nrepresents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability to cause DNA damage in \n\nsmall mammals, assessed by comet, micronucleus and sperm abnormality assays. \n\nMoreover, both species from CA zone, exposed to pesticides, with greater genetic \n\ndamage, have also greater levels of Manganese. Thus, considering that Mancozeb is \n\nthe widely used pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be \n\nthe source of the highest levels of manganese found in small mammals and it is the \n\ngenotoxic agent at issue. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase activity revealed that \n\norganophosphates and carbamates insecticides also applied are not involved in that \n\ngenotoxic action.  \n\nIn conclusion, the present work contributes to alert about hazard effects \n\nresulting from pesticide exposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally \n\nauthorized for use in European community. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: Pesticides, Mancozeb, Mus spretus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Biomarkers \nof Genotoxicity, Manganese, Acetylcholinesterase \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\nTable of Contents viii \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\nForeword .................................................................................................................... i \n\nAcknowledgments ..................................................................................................... ii \n\nResumo .................................................................................................................... iii \n\nAbstract ................................................................................................................... vii \n\nTable of Contents ....................................................................................................viii \n\nFigures Index ............................................................................................................ x \n\nTables Index ............................................................................................................xiii \n\nList of Abbreviations and Symbols ......................................................................... xiv \n\n \n\nChapter I ................................................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.

General Introduction  \n1.1. The Pesticide Problem \n \n\nThe environmental pollution induced by the chemical substances is regarded \n\nas a serious problem. Particularly, the widespread use of pesticides is affecting the \n\nentire planet, including the human health [1-3]. \n\n According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), \n\na pesticide is defined as any substance or mixture of substances intended for \n\npreventing, destroying or controlling any pest. This includes vectors of human or \n\nanimal diseases, unwanted species of plants or animals that cause harm during the \n\nproduction, processing, storage, transport, or marketing of food, agricultural \n\ncommodities, wood and wood products, or animal feedstuffs [4]. Given this broad \n\ndefinition, is not surprising that pesticides include a wide range of different \n\nsubstances that are commonly used for different proposes. \n\nIt is recognized that World War II was responsible for the development of \n\nvarious pesticides that we employ at the present.  In fact, some pesticides currently \n\nin use were developed for application in warfare, like organophosphates used as \n\nnerve gases. After World War II,  this chemicals began to be used as pesticides in \n\nenvironmental spraying for mosquito eradication and in  agriculture even when their \n\npotential hazards were unknown [5]. \n\nHowever, during the 1960s and 1970s, it began to emerge some evidences \n\nthat these chemicals could have harmful consequences. Epidemiologists in the \n\nUnited States of America noted a rise in the incidence of blood cancers and when \n\nplotted on a map, these cases were clearly clustered in agricultural areas. This \n\nincrease in blood cancers incidence paralleled the increase in pesticide use, has led \n\nsome epidemiologists to assume that there was a causal link [5] and, in 1962, with \n\nthe first publication of the Rachel Carson\u2019s revolutionary book, Silent Spring [6], it \n\nwas started the slow process of raising political and public consciousness of the \n\neffects of pesticides in wildlife, humans and ecosystems. \n\nAs a consequence of these first evidences of pesticides hazards, by the end of \n\nthe 1960s, it was created the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n2 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nthat was the first governmental agency taking action against pesticide usage. \n\nSubsequently, in 1972, United Nations began to recognize the risks posed to humans \n\nand to the environment by the increased usage of pesticides and decide to establish \n\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which together with World \n\nHealth Organization (WHO) and FAO promoted more sustainable agricultural \n\npractices  like integrated pest management [7]. Furthermore, all over the years, there \n\nhave been other efforts and initiatives to improve regulation of international pesticide \n\ntrade and an example is the creation and update of an International Code of Conduct \n\non the Distribution and Use of Pesticides [8]. \n\nNevertheless, the world has known a continuous growth of pesticide usage, \n\nnot only in number of different chemicals used but also in quantities sprayed [9]. In \n\nthe European Union there are more than 800  of synthetic pesticide products with \n\nmultiple formulations [10] and the trend is an increase because mostly pests develop \n\nresistance  and, therefore, chemical companies continuously synthesize new ones. \n\nAccording to Eurostat, Statistical Office of the European Communities [11], roughly \n\n17000 tones of pesticides were sold in Portugal, in 2008, while in 1997 was less than \n\n13000 tones (Figure 1). Although sales declined after 2002, that trend has apparently \n\nreversed, with substantially increasing in 2007 and 2008. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 21. Total volume of pesticides sold in Portugal. The total is the sum of fungicides, \nherbicides, insecticides and other pesticides [11]. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nPesticides refer to chemical substances that are biologically active and \n\ninterfere with normal biological processes of living organisms deemed to be pests. \n\nThey include a wide range of compounds and according to their functional class of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n3 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\norganisms designed to control, they can be classified as insecticides, fungicides, \n\nherbicides, rodenticides, molluscacides, nematocides and others that belonging to \n\ndifferent chemical groups. They are deliberately spread into the environment, both in \n\nurban and rural areas, for industrial, agricultural and public health purposes and, after \n\napplication, residues may persist in the environment, contaminating soils and water, \n\nremain in the crops, enter the food chain, and finally they are ingested by humans \n\nwith foodstuffs and water [9, 12]. \n\nAbout their persistence in the environment, pesticides can be classified as \n\norganochlorines, such as  DDT, that are considered persistent pesticides because \n\nthey have long environmental half-lives,  being transported over long distances by \n\nglobal circulation [13] and tend to bioaccumulate in humans and other animals, [14, \n\n15]. On the other hand, contemporary pesticides, such as organophosphates, \n\ncarbamates, triazines, and others have much shorter environmental half-lives [16] \n\nand tend not to bioaccumulate. Even so, humans are chronically exposed to many of \n\nthese no persistent chemicals because they are widely used in agriculture in large \n\nquantities which enhance their hazardous effects. \n\nAt the present time, agriculture is an important activity and source of economic \n\nincome in several countries all over the world but, at the same time, it is largely \n\nresponsible for the increased consumption of pesticides [17]. Indeed, pesticides used \n\nin agriculture are very important to reduce yield losses, maintain high product quality \n\nand sometimes improve the nutritional value of food and its safety. From this point of \n\nview, pesticides can be considered as an economic, labor-saving, and efficient tool of \n\npest management [18]. In addition, pesticides are developed through very strict \n\nregulation processes to function with reasonable certainty and minimal impact on \n\nhuman health and the environment [8, 19, 20]. Even though the published results are \n\nnot always in agreement with this and serious concerns have been raised about \n\nhealth risks resulting not only from occupational exposure to pesticides but also from \n\npesticides residues on food and in drinking water for the general population [10]. \n\nConsequently, in the last years, additional efforts have been produced to \n\nreduce the use of pesticides and biological agriculture can represent a valuable \n\noption. In Europe, the biologically managed land area has continued to grow (Figure \n\n2) and almost 7.8 million hectares (1.9 percent of the agricultural land) were \n\nmanaged biologically by more than 210000 farms in 2007 [21]. \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n4 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n \nFigure 22. Development of the biologically managed agricultural land area in Europe \nbetween 1985 and 2007 [21]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis practice respects the normal functioning of ecosystems, avoiding the use \n\nof pesticides, and leads to food \u2018\u2018free\u2019\u2019 of synthetic chemicals. It has grown so much \n\nin the last 20 years that it corresponds to the use of millions of hectares already [22]. \n\nNevertheless, organic agriculture does not appear to have the potential to respond to \n\nthe mass production of food to feed humanity [9] and it deserves wide \n\nexperimentation to fully understand its potentialities, constraints and limitations [23]. \n\nGiven the current problem of pesticide usage, an increase of pesticide legal \n\nactions, like regulations, directives, decisions and recommendations for the use of \n\npesticides is very important but not sufficient. It is urgent to find and develop \n\nalternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the consumption \n\nof pesticides, which represents a real global problem. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n5 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.2. Pesticides Toxicity and Potential Health Effects \n \n\nAs a consequence of the widespread use of pesticides, all people are \n\ninevitably exposed and concern is growing in the international community about the \n\nhealth effects consequences to this ubiquitous contamination [12]. \n\nWHO and EPA have already classified pesticides according to their potential \n\nhealth risks. According to these classifications (Table 1 and 2), pesticides are \n\ngrouped based on their median lethal dose (LD50), which is the pesticide dose that is \n\nrequired to kill half of the tested animals when entering the body by oral or dermal \n\nway [24]. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

In fact, the toxicity of the liquid formulation is usually much higher than \n\nthat of the respective solid formulation since it is more difficult for a solid to pass \n\nthrough the skin [27]. In addition, the acute inhalation lethal concentration (LC50), \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n6 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nwhich is the pesticide concentration required to kill half of the exposed tested \n\nanimals, is also considered in EPA classification. Despite all the known risks of some \n\nof these pesticides, many of those catalogued as extremely hazardous and dangers \n\nare still being used in some regions of the planet. \n\nWhile data on the acute toxicity of many of pesticides is easily recognized, \n\nknowledge on their delayed effects is much more limited.  In particular, pesticide \n\nresidues in vegetables and fruits continue to generate concern in the general \n\npopulation mainly about their potential long term adverse effects such as cancer. \n\nThese long-term effects resulting from a regular intake of pesticide are hard to detect \n\nand quantify [10, 28].  \n\nEfforts have been made to assess carcinogenicity of pesticides and the \n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an international organization \n\nthat is part of WHO, has already a classification based on evidences derived not only \n\nfrom experiments with animals but also from epidemiological studies in humans and \n\nother relevant studies where carcinogenicity of pesticides is tested [29]. Accordingly, \n\na pesticide is classified in different groups as presented in Table 3. \n \n\n \n \n\nTable 3. Classification of Pesticides carcinogenicity according to IARC [29]. \nGroup Classification \n\n1 Carcinogenic to humans \n2A Probably carcinogenic to humans - limited evidence of carcinogenicity in \n\nhumans but sufficient evidence in test animals. \n\n2B Possibly carcinogenic to humans - limited evidence of carcinogenicity in \nhumans and less than sufficient evidence in test animals. \n\n3 Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans - inadequate evidence of \ncarcinogenicity in humans and inadequate or limited evidence in test animals. \n\n4 Probably not carcinogenic to humans. \n \n \n \n \n\nEPA has a similar classification where the respective classes are carcinogenic \n\nto humans; likely to be carcinogenic to humans; suggestive evidence of carcinogenic \n\npotential; inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential; and not likely to \n\nbe carcinogenic to humans [30]. \n\nIt is important to note that these classifications results mainly from \n\ntoxicological studies on experimental animals and from epidemiological studies and \n\nnot result from cause-control studies on humans. In addition, toxicological testing is \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n7 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nbased on the administration of a single active ingredient, whereas human exposures \n\nare to a complex mixture of compounds.  So, these classifications should be \n\ninterpreted with extra caution because they can be associated with high uncertainty \n\nin the estimation of the relevant human exposure pattern [31]. On the other hand, \n\nwhen there is lack of toxicity data for specific pesticides, this does not necessarily \n\nimply that they are not toxic. They may have not been evaluated yet or that relevant \n\ndata are not available. In truth, we need to know much more about the environmental \n\nbehavior of these chemicals and about their effect upon humans.  \n\nIt is essential to invest in research of pesticides effects and, in fact, there are \n\nhundreds of scientific studies done on all continents to determine if there is a \n\nrelationship between pesticide use and human health problems [32-35]. These \n\nstudies have reported associations between exposure to pesticides and various \n\nhealth outcomes including immunologic abnormalities [1, 36], adverse reproductive \n\nand developmental effects [37],  cancer [35, 38], and neurological diseases, such as \n\nParkinson`s [39]  and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases, where cholinesterase inhibition may play \n\nan important role [40, 41].  \n\nDNA damage and oxidative stress have been proposed as mechanisms that \n\ncould link pesticide exposures to these health outcomes [42] and may be involved in \n\nthe pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer. In fact, exposure to a wide \n\nrange of pesticides induces oxidative stress reflected as accumulation of reactive \n\noxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and DNA damage [43]. Mechanisms \n\nleading to these alterations in cellular redox homeostasis are only partially \n\nunderstood for certain pesticides but, in general, pesticides have been shown to alter \n\ncellular redox balance by their enzymatic conversion to secondary reactive products \n\nand/or ROS, by depletion of antioxidant defenses and by the impairment of \n\nantioxidant enzyme function [44, 45].  \n\nAdditionally, for environmental stressors, such as pesticides, ROS may serve \n\nas common mediators of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and pathological \n\nconditions [46]. In conditions of homeostasis, cell duplication is compensated by the \n\ncell death, but in pathological conditions there is a deregulation (excessive or \n\ndeficient) cell death and homeostasis in not maintained. Apoptosis in one of this \n\nmechanisms of cell death that is highly regulated and  it is characterized by the \n\nprogressive activation of precise pathways leading to specific biochemical and \n\nmorphological alterations [47]. When induced by environmental toxicants, such as \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n8 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\npesticides, apoptosis is widely associated with alterations in redox homeostasis \n\nwhich include both the depletion of antioxidant defenses, like Glutathione (GSH) and \n\nthe increase accumulation of reactive species (RS) of oxygen or nitrogen (Figure 3). \n\nThis will originate a direct damage of the mitochondria or indirectly via activation of \n\ndeath receptor, endoplasmic reticulum stress and/or DNA damage [43, 46]. So, \n\napoptosis can be the mechanism involved in pesticide-induced pathologies where \n\ncell death has a major role. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 23. Schematic representation of apoptosis induced by environmental stressors. \nApoptosis can be induced by activating intrinsic pathways (mitochondria, DNA damage \nand/or endoplasmic reticulum stress) as well as by extrinsic pathways (activation/modulation \nof death receptors). When induced by environmental toxicants it is widely associated with \nalterations in redox homeostasis which include both the depletion of antioxidant defenses \n(such as GSH) and the increase accumulation of reactive species of oxygen or nitrogen. \nGSH-Glutathione; GSSG-Glutathione disulfide; RS-Reactive species [48]. \n \n \n \n \n\n Furthermore, various experimental data have provided evidence that \n\npesticides are potential chemical mutagens inducing gene mutation, chromosomal \n\nalteration and DNA damage [10].  These genotoxic effects are also considered \n\nserious of the possible side effects of pesticides because they may produce DNA \n\nbreakage at sites of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, thus playing a role in the \n\ninduction of malignancies in individuals exposed to these agents [49].  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n9 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.2.1. The Particular Case of Mancozeb \n \n\nAmong the 25,000 types of pesticides available, more than 80% are \n\norganophosphates or carbamates. Analogs of these last ones, dithiocarbamates, \n\nwhere oxygen atoms are replaced by sulfur atoms, are widely used as fungicides to \n\nprotect fruits, vegetables and field crops against a large spectrum of fungal diseases. \n\nParticularly, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs) which include Maneb, Zineb, and \n\nMancozeb are  regularly used in agriculture [50]. \n\nMancozeb (Figure 4), a greyish-yellow powder, is a polymeric complex of \n\nEBDC-Manganese with zinc salt (molecular weight of 265.3 + 65.4) and it is one of \n\nthe most widely used commercial fungicides worldwide [51], mainly because of its \n\nlow acute toxicity in mammals and scarce persistence in the environment [52]. It is \n\nnot known to occur as a nature product and it is synthesized from carbamate radicals \n\nthat have reacted with carbon disulfide to give dialkyldithiocarbamates. After that, it \n\nreacts to diamines originating dithiocarbamates, and, finally, with the addition of a \n\nzinc chloride, is produced Mancozeb [29, 53].  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 24. Chemical structure of Mancozeb [51]. \n\nMancozeb is used to control fungal diseases that afflict many important \n\neconomic crops, including potato, tomato, fruits and flowers. It is a broad-spectrum \n\npesticide that indiscriminately kills a range of organisms, targeted as well as \n\nuntargeted (and beneficial) species. It is a contact fungicide (non systemic) that \n\ndisrupts cell metabolism, namely lipid metabolism [54]. This synthetic fungicide has a \n\nshort environmental resistance with low solubility in water and low soil persistence. It \n\nis hydrolyzed within 1 day in sterile water [53] and has a field half-life of 1 to 7 days. \n\nOn the other hand, it has low volatility at standard temperatures and pressure but can \n\nbe found associated with air-borne particulates or as spray drift. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n10 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nEven though Mancozeb has been characterized as less acutely toxic and less \n\npersistent in the environment, one of its main degradation products resulting of a \n\nspontaneous breakdown, ethylenethiourea (ETU) shows a long persistence (5\u201310 \n\nweeks) in soil and high water solubility. ETU is thought to be the source of most of \n\nthe toxicity associated with EBDCs and consequently with Mancozeb [50]. Its \nresidues are regularly detected in fruit and vegetables, and it has been shown that a \n\nsignificant percentage of ETU is produced during cooking of contaminated foods [55]. \n\nThis compound has been reported to have carcinogen, teratogen and goitrogen \n\neffects [53, 56, 57].  \n\nAlthough the risk of intoxication by EBDCs mainly concerns industrial and \n\nagricultural workers [58], the general population can be chronically exposed to \n\ndietary residues present of such pesticides in food. Mancozeb, despite its low acute \n\ntoxicity, has been shown to produce significant toxicological effects on thyroid [58, \n\n59], immune system [60], reproductive system [61-64] and nervous system [65], \n\nMoreover, Mancozeb was considered a multipotent carcinogen, inducing a variety of \n\ntumors of different origin in rats after chronic exposure [66], mutagenic [67] and  \n\npossibly teratogenic [68].  \n\nThe alkylation of DNA is a mechanism that could be invoked to explain the \n\nDNA damage induced by the EBDC pesticides [69]. On the other hand some studies \n\ndemonstrate that Mancozeb may act as prooxidants inside the cell. This mechanism \n\nis based on the presence of coordinated transitional metals, like manganese and zinc \n\npresent in the chemical structure of this pesticide that will catalyze the formation of \n\nROS through the Fenton reaction, where metals have a strong catalytic power to \n\ngenerate highly reactive radicals [67, 70].  \n\nEven though Mancozeb is considered to have a low acute toxicity in mammals \n\n(Class U in the WHO classification) [24]  and not listed about its carcinogenicity in \n\nIARC classification, it is crucial to give a little attention to their long-term effects not \n\nonly from the harmful action of ETU but also from its metallic constituents.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n11 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.3. Using Biomarkers to Assess Pesticides Toxicity \n \n\nThe term biomarker is used to include almost any measurement reflecting an \n\ninteraction between a biological system and an environmental agent, which may be \n\nchemical, physical, or biological [71]. In other words, biomarkers are indicators of \n\nevents in biological systems that could clarify relationships between environmental \n\nhazards and health effects or disease process [72]. Therefore, biomarkers can be \n\nused to identify causal associations, making possible to recognize susceptible groups \n\nor individuals who are at risk of exposure to certain toxic agents [73].  \n\nBiomarkers can be divided into three classes (Figure 5): biomarkers of \n\nsusceptibility, that indicate an organism`s inherent or acquired limitations affecting its \n\nresponse to a toxic exposure; biomarkers of effect, that provide information on an \n\npreclinical event occurring at a target site  in consequence of exposure, correlated to \n\nmanifestation of disease; and biomarkers of exposure, that integrate all routes of \n\nexposure to a particular contaminant [74, 75].  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 25. Schematic representation of the different types of Biomarkers of a toxicant from \nexposure to induction of health effects. [75]. \n \n\nAdditionally, biomarkers of exposure currently available for monitoring pesticide \n\nexposure can be divided into two main groups: internal dose and biologically effective \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n12 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\ndose [74]. Internal dose means the measurement of chemical agents or their \n\nmetabolites either in tissues, secreta, excreta or  exhaled air in order to evaluate \n\nexposure and health risk [76]. A biomarker of biologically effective dose measures \n\nthe amount of a toxicant that has interacted with a target site and altered its \n\nphysiological function. These biomarkers may be spontaneously repaired or may \n\nlead to the development of disease [75, 76]. \n\nThe use of several biomarkers is recognized as an important approach for the \n\nassessment of pollution, as chemical analysis of environmental samples alone does \n\nnot provide evidence of the impacts in organisms. Biomarkers to assess pesticides \n\ntoxicity cover a wide range [28] but this study will focus only on some biomarkers of \n\ngenotoxicity (Comet, Micronucleus and Sperm Abnormality assays), \n\nacetylcholinesterase inhibition, manganese quantification and one biomarker of \n\nsusceptibility (CYP1A1). \n \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity \n \n\nBiomarkers of genotoxicity provide measures of the alterations of important \n\ngenetic targets, like chromosomes, chromatids or gene sequences where  the link \n\nbetween the measured parameter and the development of tumors is probably closer \n\n[77]. Examples are sister chromatid exchanges, micronuclei, comet assay and \n\nchromosome aberrations, that are often associated with higher cancer incidence [78]. \n\nFor genotoxic chemicals, such as pesticides, techniques that measure DNA \n\ndamage provide a powerful tool in measuring environmental effects and the most \n\ncommonly used test for genetic damage is classical chromosome aberration analysis. \n\nHowever, an inexpensive and simpler test looks for micronuclei, whole or fragmented \n\nextra chromosomes resulting from abnormal mitosis. Some studies use, yet, newer \n\ntests to assess DNA damage, such as Sister Chromatid Exchange, Comet assay and \n\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH),  assay [79]. Sperm abnormality assay is also \n\nregularly applied to get information on the transmission of genetic damages. The use \n\nof multiple tests is very useful because it provides more information about the \n\ndifferent types of lesions in the genetic material, allowing for greater reliability of \n\nresults.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n13 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.3.1.1. Comet Assay \n \n\nThe Comet assay or single-cell gel electrophoresis test is a useful technique for \n\nstudying DNA damage and, during the last two decades, it has become a method of \n\nincreasing popularity [80-82]. It has been accepted by the United Kingdom \nCommittee on Mutagenicity testing of chemicals in food, consumer products, and \n\nenvironment as a test for assessing DNA damage [83]. \n Ostling and Johanson (1984) were the first to use this assay to quantify DNA \n\ndamage induced by radiation in cells. Their technique consisted of lysing cells with \n\ndetergents and high salt, and subjecting the liberated DNA to electrophoresis under \n\nneutral conditions. Cells with an increased frequency of DNA double-strand breaks \ndisplayed increased migration of DNA toward the anode. The migrating DNA was, \n\nthen, quantified by staining with ethidium bromide and by measuring the intensity of \n\nfluorescence using a microscope photometer. The amount of the DNA liberated from \n\nthe head of the \u201ccomet\u201d depends on the effect of the genotoxic agent [84]. \n\nHowever, the neutral conditions used by Ostling and Johanson greatly limited \n\nthe general utility of the assay because it only detects double-strand breaks (DSB) \n\n[85]. Consequently, the assay was adapted under alkaline conditions by Singh et al. \n\n(1988), which led to a sensitive version of the assay because it could assess both \n\ndouble and single-strand DNA breaks (SSB) as well as the alkali labile sites (ALS) \n\nexpressed as single-strand breaks [86]. \n\nThe alkaline version of the Comet assay (Figure 6) is the methodology of \n\nchoice. Generally, a cell suspension is embedded in agarose on a microscope slide \n\nand lysed by detergents and a high salt concentration in order to liberate the DNA. \n\nAfterwards, the slides are treated at alkaline conditions (pH>13) to produce single \n\nstranded DNA and to express ALS as SSB. During electrophoresis at the same alkali \n\ncondition, DNA fragments induced by genotoxic agents migrate to the anode side. \n\nSubsequently, the slides are washed with a neutralizing solution, where DNA strands \n\nseparated by alkaline treatment in the comet head will readily renature due to their \n\nintact structure with supercoiled loops, while the DNA in tail will remain single-\n\nstranded [81, 82]. Then, slides are stained with  and fluorescent DNA binding dyes \n\nand  when viewed under a microscope, a cell has the appearance of a comet, with a \n\nhead (the nuclear region) and a tail containing DNA fragments [87]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n14 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n \nFigure 26. Schematic representation of critical steps in the alkaline version of Comet Assay. \nAdapted from Speit and Hartman, 1999 [88]. \n \n \n \n \n\nScoring of DNA damage can be performed by visual (manual) scoring or by \n\nusing an automated software scoring system with an image capture device attached \n\nto the microscope, that will permit the measurement of parameters such as the \n\npercentage of DNA in the tail (% tail DNA), tail length and tail moment (fraction of \n\nmigrated DNA multiplied by some measure of tail length). % tail DNA is considered a \n\nbetter parameter as this gives a clear indication of the appearance of the comets \n\nand, in addition, is linearly related to the DNA break frequency over a wide range of \n\nlevels of damage. It represents a more sensitive measure of DNA damage because it \n\ncontinues to increase with increased DNA damage, while tail length may not [89-93].  \n\nThe Comet assay possesses a number of advantages as compared to other \n\ngenotoxicity tests. It is sensitive for detecting low levels of DNA damage, applicable \n\nto various tissues and/or special cell types, flexible to use proliferating as well as non \n\nproliferating cells, require for only small numbers of cells per sample, easy of \n\napplication, low cost, and one short time needed to perform the assay [85]. This is a \n\nnon-invasive technique compared to other DNA damage techniques, such as  \n\nchromosomal aberrations or micronucleus assay in the bone marrow, which require a \n\nlarger sample as well as proliferating cell population [81]. In addition, this assay can \n\nbe used to evaluate various types of DNA damage and is readily modifiable for \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n15 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nadaptation to a variety of experimental requirements [85]. DNA damage assessed by \n\nthe Comet assay gives an indication of recent exposure and at an early stage where \n\nit could also undergo repair without resulting in permanent genetic alteration [94]. \n\nThus, it provides an opportunity for intervention strategies to be implemented timely \n\n[83]. \n\nA limitation of the Comet assay is that aneugenic effects, which may be a \n\npossible mechanism for carcinogenicity and epigenetic mechanisms of DNA damage \n\nsuch as effects on cell-cycle checkpoints, are not detected. On the other hand, \n\nneither the extent of DNA migration in the comet assay nor the shape of the comet \n\ncan reveal the mode of action of the mutagenic potential of a test substance and it \n\nhas technical variability and interpretation [95]. However, the advantages far \n\noutnumber the disadvantages, and hence, it has been widely used in fields ranging \n\nfrom molecular epidemiology to genetic toxicology [83].  \n \n \n\n1.3.1.2. Micronucleus Assay \n \n\n \n\nThe Micronucleus (MN) assay applied to erythrocyte cells has been usually \n\nused as a simple and sensitive method for determining the genotoxicity of chemical \n\nsubstances [96, 97]. It is extensively used as a biomarker of chromosomal damage, \n\ngenome instability, and eventually of cancer risk [98]. This assay is based on the \n\ndetection of small nuclei (micronuclei) formed during the metaphase-anaphase \n\ntransition of cell division. It may be a chromosome (aneugenic phenomenon leading \n\nto loss of chromosome) or an acentric chromosome fragment (clastogenic \n\nphenomenon)  that stood out of a chromosome after breakage [99].  \n\n In greater detail, in process of erythropoiesis, proliferating stem cells start to \n\ndivide at which time a genotoxic agent may cause chromosome damage, such as \n\nbreaks and exchanges. In addition, the genotoxic agent may also acts on \n\nmacromolecules related to the function of chromatid disjunction, such as tubulin, \n\ncausing spindle dysfunction (Figure 7). Consequently, a fragment or a whole \n\nchromosome may lag behind in the cell during division and may not become \n\nintegrated into daughter nuclei, forming MN in the cytoplasm.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n16 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n \nFigure 27. Scheme of the formation of micronucleated erythrocytes by mutagenic agents.  \nMNE: Micronucleated erythrocytes [96]. \n \n \n \n \n\nAfterwards, during maturation in the process of erythropoiesis, the erythroblast \n\ndevelops into a polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) that is a young erythrocyte still \n\ncontains RNA, and the main nucleus is extruded. Therefore, if any MN has been \n\nformed during proliferation, it will remain in the enucleated cytoplasm and its \n\nvisualization is facilitated because PCEs lack a main nucleus. PCEs, with time, lose \n\nRNA and develop into a normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs), that are mature \n\nerythrocytes and they may also contain MN [97]. \n\nTraditionally, MN are identified using Giemsa staining method [99] but Hayashi \n\net al. (1990) introduced a  new method using acridine orange (AO) to improve the \n\nidentification of immature erythrocytes [100]. PCEs are identified by red fluorescing \n\nreticulum in the cytoplasm, and MN fluoresce greenish yellow while NCEs fluoresce \n\nas pale green. AO staining method is more useful and gives more reliable results \n\nthan the usual Giemsa because both PCEs and  MN can be easily distinguished from \n\nNCEs [96]. \n\n MN represents an integrated response to chromosome-instability phenotypes \n\nand altered cellular viabilities caused by genetic defects and/or exogenous \n\nexposures to genotoxic agents. As a result, an increase in the frequency of MN is an \n\nindication of induced chromosome damage. Moreover, the PCE/NCE ratio between \n\ntest agent-treated animals and vehicle-control animals provides a cytotoxicity index \n\nbecause a decrease in this ratio would indicate destruction of immature erythrocytes \n\n[97]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n17 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nThis assay has several important advantages over the analysis of bone-\n\nmarrow metaphase analysis often used. It is technically simple, the endpoint scored \n\nis more objective and amenable for automation, it is less time consuming and it can \n\nbe easily integrated into general toxicology studies [97].  This assay can be also \n\napplied to peripheral blood or other tissues or organs and it is a promising assay \n\nsystem, especially when used with FISH. With FISH, the presence of centromeres in \n\nMN can be clearly detected, and the ability to detect differences between MN \n\ninduced by clastogens or by spindle poisons became possible [101, 102].  \n\n \n\n1.3.1.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay \n \n\n \n\nThere are several studies showing that pesticides have a direct effect on \n\nreproductive health, particularly in the formation of sperm cells [103-108]. The widely  \n\nand first publicized report about these adverse effects was the case of pesticide \n\ndibromochloropropane (DBCP), in 1977, when Whorton et al. observed that male \n\nworkers of a DBCP-producing factory in California in the United States became \n\ninfertile after being exposed [109]. \n\nThe DBCP story served to alert people about the potential for pesticides in to \n\nalter reproductive function in men. It also provided the rationale for adding direct \n\nevaluations of sperm production and quality to reproductive toxicology test protocols \n\nin which the rat is the preferred test species. The inclusion of measures of rat sperm \n\nquality, such as motility and morphology, into reproductive test protocols often \n\nincreases the sensitivity of the test to detect effects [110]. \n\nParticularly, about morphological analysis, sperm abnormality assay is a \n\nsensitive and reliable endpoint and is widely used to identify germ cell mutagens \n\n[111, 112]. This biomarker is advantageous because the reproducibility of the results \n\nand, overall the possibility to get information on the transmission of genetic damages \n\nin successive generations. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [1975], the classification \n\nof anomalies of the sperm is based on changes in the head and tail that is shown in \n\nFigure 8 [113]. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n18 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n \nFigure 28. Classification of abnormalities in rodent sperm.

However, \n\ninduction of abnormal sperms is presumed to be a result of naturally occurring errors \n\nin the differentiation process, or the consequence of an abnormal chromosome \n\ncomplement. In accordance to some authors the alterations in sperm  can, in fact,  \n\noccur as a consequence of DNA mutations and  additionally by endocrine \n\ndysfunction [114-117]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n19 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.3.2. Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition  \n \n\nAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is widely used as a specific biomarker of \n\norganophosphorus (OPs) and carbamate insecticides that are commonly used in \n\nagriculture [118]. These anticholinesterase pesticides have the ability to inhibit AChE \n\nactivity that is an enzyme   responsible for modulating neural communication in the \n\nsynaptic cleft by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. OPs and carbamates \n\nlead to a phosphorilation and carbamylation of the serine residue at AChE catalytic \n\nsite, respectively. In that conditions, enzyme is highly stable and the hydrolysis of \n\nacetylcholine is blocked [119].The neurotransmitter accumulates in the synaptic cleft \n\nwhich originates the continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the \n\nnervous systems. Depending on the degree of inhibition, cholinergic stimulation may \n\nlead to hyperactivity of excitable tissues, causing convulsions, severe muscle \n\nparalysis, hypersecretion from secretory glands, respiratory failure, coma and even \n\ndeath. The enzyme can be restored to its active state but in some cases, depending \n\non the chemical structure of the pesticide, the inhibition may be irreversible [119, \n\n120]. The Food and Agriculture Organization recommends that 20% inhibition is the \n\nrelevant end-point to determine acceptable daily intakes of an anticholinesterasic \n\ncompound [121]. \n\nBeyond this principal AChE involved in nerve impulse transmission, there are \n\nAChEs present in the outer membrane of erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterases \n\npresent in blood plasma, liver and muscle tissues but their physiological function are \n\nunknown and it has a different substrate. Pseudocholinesterases are often inhibited \n\nmore effectively by OPs and carbamates but their inhibition has no relation to that \n\noccurring in either erythrocytes or brain [122, 123]. The AChE activity in the brain is \n\nclosely correlated with that measured in erythrocytes and to a lesser extent with \n\npseudocholinesterase activity in the others tissues [76]. Notwithstanding, it is difficult \n\nto know how closely AChE inhibition in erythrocytes reflects that in the nervous \n\nsystem. Since access to blood is always easier than access to the brain, the \n\ninhibition of erythrocyte AChE is very useful as biomarker of exposure to pesticides \n\nand it usually overestimates AChE in the brain [123]. \n\nThere are strong associations between exposures to pesticides and AChE \n\ninhibition symptoms. In accordance to some authors AChE is, in fact, significantly \n\nreduced in exposed populations [124-126]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n20 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nUndoubtedly, the most widely used assay to detect AChE inhibition is the \n\nEllman\u00b4s method. This method is extremely sensitive and is applicable to either small \n\namounts of tissue and to low concentrations of enzyme [127].  This method is based \n\non coupling of reactions presented in Figure 9: \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 29. Principle of the Ellman\u00b4s method.

Yellow TNB is quantified at 412 nm using a \n\nspectrophotometer. \n\nThe main advantages of the Ellman\u00b4s method are simplicity, accuracy, a \n\ncontinuous increase in color density as a function of incubation time, and relatively \n\nlow cost. It is easily adaptable for automated analyzers or plate readers for the rapid \n\nprocessing of large numbers of samples [127]. \n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n21 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.3.3. Manganese Quantification as a Mancozeb Biomarker \n \n\nManganese (Mn) is an essential element that is required for growth, \n\ndevelopment, and maintenance of health. Within its multiple functions, it is a \n\ncomponent and an activator of multiple important enzymes, like pyruvate \n\ncarboxylase, superoxide dismutase or alkaline phosphatase and it is required for the \n\nformation of healthy cartilage and bone. Moreover, Mn is essential in the \n\nmaintenance of mitochondria, production of glucose and in the urea cycle. It also \n\nplays a key role in wound-healing [128]. \n\nMn is the 12th most abundant element in the Earth\u2019s crust and constituting \n\nabout 0.1% of it. Pure Mn is a silver-colored metal but it does not occur as a free \n\nmetal.  Instead, it is found combined with oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine in more than \n\n100 minerals and is one of the most used metals in the industry with a wide range of \n\napplications. Magnetic resonance imaging, antiknock agent and fungicides \n\nformulations are the most recent applications of this metal. Particularly, Mn enters in \n\nthe constitution of Mancozeb, a fungicide extremely used in agriculture, at the \n\npresent time [128]. \n\nThe general population is exposed to Mn through consumption of food and \n\nwater, inhalation of air, and dermal contact with air, water, soil, and consumer \n\nproducts that contain Mn. The primary source of Mn intake is through diet and Mn is \n\nnaturally present in food and in drinking water at low levels. Daily intakes of Mn range \n\nfrom 2-9 mg/day  depending on nutritional habits and only 3-5% is absorbed from the \n\ngastrointestinal tract [128]. However it is considered that the diet of most people in \n\ndeveloped countries contains sufficient manganese [129]. The oxidation states of \n\nmanganese range from 0 to +7 but the most stable valence is +2 and this is the state \n\nof Mn absorved from the gastrointestinal tract like tetravalent state [130]. This low \n\ngastrointestinal absorption together with a rapid elimination  limit the toxicity of the \n\nMn [130].  \n\nDespite its essentiality, possible involvement of high levels of Mn compounds \n\nin causing hazard effects on human health has been alert public to its utilization. On \n\nthe other hand, Mn plays an important role in antioxidant defenses and forms part of \n\na superoxide dismutase which often is characteristically modified in cancer cells. So, \n\nthere is needed to consider the balance between essentiality and toxicity, when \n\nconduct of risk assessments for an essential element such as Mn [129]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n22 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nIt is consensual that chronic exposure to high levels of Mn is associated with \n\nadverse outcomes. John Couper, in 1837, was the first to report these Mn effects, \n\nwhen he described muscle weakness, limb tremor, whispering speech, salivation, \n\nand a bent posture in five men working in a Mn ore crushing plant in France [131]. \n\nThis is the first description of manganism symptoms, a permanent neurological \n\ndisorder caused by continued exposure to high levels of Mn. In fact, Mn has been \n\nshown to cross the blood-brain barrier, enters in  the nervous system that is the \n\nprimary target organ, originating behavioral changes and movements that may \n\nbecome slow and clumsy [130, 132, 133].  \n\nDespite the mechanism of toxicity of Mn is poorly understood, several studies \n\nindicate that oxidative stress and mitochondria play major roles in the Mn-induced \n\nneurodegenerative diseases [134, 135]. Moreover, there are some evidences that \n\nManganese interferes with various mechanisms in nervous system, particularly in \n\nAChE activity. About interference of Mn in AChE activity, there have been conflicting \n\nreports regarding the effects of manganese treatment in developing rats. There are \n\nstudies that indicate a significant inhibition AChE activity observed following lengthy \n\nperiods of exposure to manganese [136]. On the other hand, Liapi et al (2008) \n\nsuggests that short-term Mn administration causes a statistically significant increase \n\nin AChE activity in rats [137].  \n\nMn appears to exert different effects on AChE activity in different stages of the \n\nlife cycle. As a result, AChE activity is unaffected by manganese during development, \n\nbut increased in a long-term exposure to manganese throughout development until \n\nadulthood. During aging, the physiological decrease in AChE activity is abolished by \n\nmanganese [136, 138-141]. \n\nEffects of Mn at neurological level [142] are, in fact, the most investigated but \n\nMn have also another target organs in respiratory, reproductive, endocrine and \n\nhematological systems [142-144]. Furthermore,  a limited amount of manganese is \n\nalso able to cross the placenta during pregnancy, thus potentiate its teratogenic \n\naction [128]. Information on cancer due to Mn is scanty but the results available do \n\nnot indicate that Mn is carcinogenic. However, Mn is a proven mutagen, causing \n\nDNA damage and chromosome aberrations [129]. \n\nAs previous mentioned, Mn enters on Mancozeb formulation. So, \n\nquantification of this metal in urine or in the organism can be used as a biomarker of \n\nexposure to Mancozeb. The most common analytical procedures for measuring Mn \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n23 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nlevels in biological and environmental samples are the methods of Atomic Absorption \n\nSpectroscopy (AAS). Particularly, the Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption \n\nSpectrometry (GFAAS) analysis is often used for very low analyte levels and for the \n\nanalysis of solid samples [145]. In this method, the sample is aspirated into a \n\ngraphite furnace until the element atomizes. Then, the ground-state atomic vapor \n\nabsorbs monochromatic radiation from a source and a photoelectric detector \n\nmeasures the intensity of radiation absorbed. It is important to refer that this \n\nmethodology requires acidic digestion of the organic matrix in the biological materials \n\nprior to analysis and that special care is needed to avoid contamination of biological \n\nmaterials with exogenous Mn, especially for samples with low levels of Mn [128, 146]. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n24 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.3.4. CYP1A1 as a genetic marker of Susceptibility \n \n\nGenetic polymorphism is a difference in DNA sequence among individuals, \n\ngroups or populations that may have been induced by external agents. The simplest \n\nform and the most common source of genetic polymorphism in the human genome is \n\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). SNP is a single base mutation in DNA and is \n\npresent at about 1 per 1,000 nucleotides in humans [147]. These polymorphisms can \n\nchange the level of expression of a gene or change the activity of a gene product \n\n[148] which can be used a genetic marker of susceptibility when associated with an \n\nincreased risk of develop certain diseases. \n\nThrough the recent advances in molecular biology, these genetic markers of \n\nsusceptibility have been developing and now they play a key role in environmentally \n\ninduced diseases. Individual inheritance of variant polymorphic genes involved in the \n\nmetabolism of chemical compounds, such as pesticides, can be good markers of \n\nsusceptibility because they allow to understanding the relationships between \n\nexposure to these toxic chemicals and the development of chronic diseases [32]. In \n\nmore detail,  genotypes responsible for inter individual differences in the ability to \n\nactivate or detoxify pesticides will influence the genotoxic damage caused by this \n\npesticides [73]. So, through the ability to sequence DNA and find individual \n\ngenotypes, it is possible to discover the relationship between exposure and disease \n\ndevelopment according to genotype information. In case of humans, this is very \n\nuseful because that information could be coupled with medical information to \n\ndiagnose disease onset and to develop strategies of treatment [28].  \n\nAs human population is biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous, it \n\nis not surprising that differences in susceptibility to disease among individuals with or \n\nwithout exposure to environmental chemicals exist and many genetic conditions \n\nassociated with enhanced susceptibility to environmental chemicals remain to be \n\ndiscovered [149]. There has been a great investment in this area and various genetic \n\npolymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics have been \n\nexamined. As a result, some studies have reported an association between \n\npolymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in human xenobiotics \n\nmetabolism and susceptibility to cancer [150] . \n\nCytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a superfamily of 57 genes that encode \n\nenzymes involved in the typical activation reaction which converts indirect \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n25 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\ncarcinogens to active electrophiles capable of interacting with the biological \n\nmacromolecules DNA, RNA and proteins [77, 151]. Particularly, the family of genes \n\nCYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 codify three enzymes, respectively, that detoxify or \n\nactivate many procarcinogens, environmental toxins and some \n\ndrugs. The activity of CYP1A1 is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n\n(PAHs), such as those found in cigarette smoke, diet and pollutants relapsed from \n\nthe combustion of fossil fuels. Its gene product is a hydroxylase which catalyzes the \n\nfirst step of the metabolism of PAHs to electrophilic compounds.  These enzymes are \n\nmembrane associated proteins located in either the inner membranes of \n\nmitochondria and in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where they metabolize \n\nthousands of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The expression of \n\nCYP1A1 is mainly extrahepatic. [152]. Many enzymatic isoforms of this enzyme have \n\nbeen suggested to contribute to individual cancer susceptibility as genetic modifiers \n\nof cancer risk after exposure to genotoxic agents [153, 154]. Moreover, some genetic \n\npolymorphisms of CYP1A1 gene have been associated with an elevated risk of lung, \n\ncolorectal and breast cancer [155-157].  \n\nThe role of specific polymorphisms of CYP genes, involved in the activation \n\nand detoxification of xenobiotics, in modulating cytogenetic effects have been studied \n\nin pesticide-exposed populations [153, 154, 158]. Even though, the available data on \n\nfarmer populations suggest that individuals with unfavorable metabolizing alleles are \n\nmore susceptible to genotoxic effects than those with favorable alleles, but there are \n\nno conclusive findings on whether metabolic polymorphisms affect the chromosomal \n\ndamage induced by pesticides. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n26 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.4. Using Small Mammals as Bioindicators \n \n\nThe term bioindicator has been applied to living organisms whose \n\ncharacteristics are used to reveal the presence or absence of environmental \n\nconditions [159]. Thus, a bioindicator permits to evaluate a modification, usually a \n\ndeterioration of the environmental quality and some wild species can carry out this \n\npurpose, being predictors of ecotoxicological consequences when contaminants are \n\nintroduced in the environment [160].  \n\nConsequently, if animals living in polluted environments, like small mammals, \n\naccumulate toxicants  with effects for their health, they can be used as bioindicators \n\nof that environmental pollution [161]. For example, morphological measures such as \n\nbody and internal organs masses are commonly used to assess their health status \n\n[162, 163]. Moreover, the assessment of their hematological parameters also \n\nprovides important information on their health and physiological status. Several \n\nstudies have reported alterations of these measurements in small mammals when \n\nexposed to certain pollutants [162, 164]. Small mammals are able to accumulate a \n\nwide spectrum of pollutants which are present in the ecosystem [161] and, \n\nparticularly, some significant correlations between pesticides and genetic damage in \n\nfree-living rodents have been detected [165].  \n\nThere are a lot of arguments for the use of small mammals in pollution \n\nbiomonitoring and hazard assessment.  They are often considered to represent an \n\nintermediate stage between low and high trophic levels, since they feed on herbs, \n\nfruits and invertebrates, and they constitute important items in the diet of carnivorous \n\nanimals. Moreover, they participate actively in soil bioturbation and, despite their \n\nsmall body size, they have a high metabolic rate, being their degree of exposure \n\ngreater than in large mammals, which have a slower metabolic rate [166-168].  \n\nOn the other hand, the use of small mammals, mostly rodents in this type of \n\nwork is very important because they have enough genetic and physiological \n\nsimilarities with humans and, therefore, it allows extrapolating the effect of these \n\npollutants. Many rodent carcinogens are also human carcinogens, and hence, this \n\nmodel not only provides an insight into the genotoxicity of human carcinogens but \n\nalso is suited for studying their underlying mechanisms. \n\nThe wild small mammal species, Algerian mouse (Mus spretus Lataste, 1883) \n\nand wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus, Linnaeus, 1758) were chosen in this study \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n27 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\nas pesticide pollution bioindicators. These species have been widely used as a \n\nbioindicators in some environmental studies [160,162, 169-171]. \n\nAlgerian mouse belongs to the family Muridae and it is a rodent species that \n\ninhabits the occidental portion of Mediterranean Europe and North Africa. They \n\noccupy sub-humid and semi-arid habitats, typically Mediterranean, and have an \n\nherbivore diet composed with seeds, leaves, stalks and fruits. Wood mouse also \n\nbelongs to the family Muridae and it inhabits Europe and North Africa. They consume \n\nseeds, fruits, insect larvae, earthworms, or plant material depending on local and \n\nseasonal abundance [172, 173].  \n\n  \nFigure 30. A- Apodemus sylvaticus [174]; B- Mus spretus [175]. \n\n \n\nThese two species meet the criteria of good bioindicators because they are \n\nabundant and are easily caught; they contact with soil during their entire life cycle, \n\nbeing exposed to pesticides mainly by ingestion of contaminated food or soil as well \n\nthrough dermal absorption; their populations are usually large enough to support \n\nindividuals collection without a major adverse effect at a population and they also are \n\nquite accessible for both population investigation and experimental research [176]. \n\n  \n\nB A \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n28 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction \n\n1.5. Thesis Context and Objectives \n \n\n \n\nThe widespread use of pesticides in agriculture represents a threat not only to \n\nthe environment but also to human populations exposed to them. Conventional \n\nagriculture practices are largely responsible for the increased consumption of \n\npesticides worldwide and, in Portugal, this consumption also have been increased. \n\nAs a consequence,  investments  have been made  in biological agriculture, \n\nwithout the use  of pesticides,  but this practice is still very restricted. Therefore, \n\nhuman exposure to pesticides continues to be inevitably and it is important to be alert \n\nin relation to their possible hazard effects. \n\nThe main aim of the present thesis is the in situ assessment of pesticides \n\ntoxicity, using biomarkers to compare the health state of two small mammal species \n\n(Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from conventional agriculture (CA) versus \n\nbiological agriculture (BA) zone. Specific objectives of this thesis include:  \n\n1. to investigate the potential genotoxic effects of pesticides on small mammals, \n\nusing Micronucleus, Comet and Sperm Abnormality assays as biomarkers;  \n\n2. to assess morphologic and physiologic conditions of both species;  \n\n3. to appraise the adequacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibition as a biomarker of \n\nexposure to organophosphates and carbamates;  \n\n4. to investigate the adequacy of manganese quantification as a biomarker of \n\nexposure to Mancozeb, the principal pesticide used in  the studied CA zone; \n\n5. to perform preliminary genotype analysis to try establish more frequent profiles \n\nfor CYP1A1 polymorphism gene that are involved in the activation and \n\ndetoxification of xenobiotics like pesticides; \n\n6. to appraise the adequacy of those biomarkers adopted;  \n\n7. to compare the two different species of small mammals from the two different \n\nzones to verify which one is the best bioindicator of pesticide exposure; \n\n8. to evaluate the potential environmental risk upon wildlife as well as the likely \n\nimpact on human health; \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n29 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\n \n\n2. Material and Methods \n2.1. Sampling and Animals Capture \n \n\nThis study was carried out in an agricultural zone of Alcoba\u00e7a, district of Leiria, \n\nPortugal (Figure 11). In this region, agriculture is still an important economic activity \n\nwith a wide area under agricultural practice. \n \n\n \nFigure 31. Geographic location of agricultural zones in study (adapted from [177]). \n \n\nIt was considered that conventional and biological agriculture zones (Figure 12) \n\nare both insert in the same biotope (?1km of distance between them) and it was \n\npresumed that pesticide use is the main external factor that distinguishes them. The \n\nbiological agriculture zone is correctly isolated from adjacent agriculture zones, so it \n\nis expected that it cannot be affected by adjacent pesticides applications. \n\nBefore animals capture, the agreement and the cooperation of the farmers \n\ninvolved were required and they were asked about pesticides and others chemical \n\nproducts that were used in the fields. While in biological agriculture (BA) zone, the \n\nowner farmer ensured that there were not used any type of chemical products, being \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n30 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\nan agricultural practice based on the use of natural enemies for the pest control that \n\nwas converted about 5 years ago, in conventional agriculture (CA) zone, the owner \n\nfarmer provided a list of pesticides used, where OPs, carbamates insecticides and \n\nEBDCs were the most representative groups. Moreover, CA farmer ensure that more \n\nthan 50% of the applications were based on one EBDC: Mancozeb. Thus, Mancozeb \n\nis the most used pesticide in the CA zone. \n \n\n \nFigure 32. A- Conventional agriculture (CA) zone; B- Biological agriculture (BA) zone. \n\n \n\nApproximately 60 small mammals of both sexes were captured between \n\nDecember 2010 and February 2011 in both zones (Figure 12). All the animals were \n\ntreated according to the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the \n\nCouncil of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific \n\npurposes [178]. Small mammals were captured with Sherman traps using a mixture \n\nof canned sardine, flour and oil as bait. Cotton was also placed inside each trap to \n\nminimize lower temperatures that were felt during the night. Pregnant or lactant \n\nfemales were discharged as well as animals with less than 10g of weight. Mice were \n\nhoused in individual plastic cages until reach the laboratory with ad libitum access to \n\nfood and water.  \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n31 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\n2.2. Animals Sacrifice and Morphophisiological \nAnalysis \n \n\nSmall mammals were anesthetized and weighed before sacrifice and then \n\ngeneral measurements were made (body size, tail size, left paw size, left ear size).  \n\nCardiac puncture was done for blood collection, using a syringe with heparin \n\nto prevent coagulation and during dissection, organs were removed (liver, heart, \n\nkidneys, spleen, testis, femurs and brain) and weighed. Liver, heart, kidneys, spleen \n\nand brain were stored on cold (-70 \u00baC) for subsequent analysis. \n\nMoreover, hematological parameters were taken from animal\u2019s blood using \n\nBeckman Coulter Act Diff Hematology Analyzer that measures the following \n\nparameters: WBC (white blood cells; x103/\u00b5L), RBC (red blood cells; x106/\u00b5L), Hgb \n\n(hemoglobin; g/dL), Hct (hematocrit; %), MCV (mean corpuscular volume; fL), MCH \n\n(mean corpuscular hemoglobin; pg) and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin \n\nconcentration; g/dL). \n \n\n2.3. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity  \n\n2.3.1. Comet Assay \n \n\nThe comet assay was performed as described by Singh et al. [86] with minor \n\nmodifications. An aliquot of 15 \u00b5L of the blood samples collected by cardiac puncture \nwas mixed with 300 \u00b5l 0.8% low-melting point agarose (37\u00baC) and then placed on a \n\nslide precoated with 1% normal-melting-point agarose. Immediately after that, the \n\nslide was covered with a coverslip and was then kept for 5 minutes on ice to solidify. \n\nAfter gently removing the coverslip, subsequent to solidification, slide was immersed \n\nin a cold lysing solution (2.5M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA, 10mM Tris, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 \n\nand 10% (v/v) DMSO) at 4\u00baC over night. After lysis, the slide was placed in a \n\nhorizontal electrophoresis box. The box was filled with fresh electrophoresis solution \n\n(1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH?13) and the slide was left in this solution for 40 min \n\nto allow unwinding. Electrophoresis was performed using the same solution at 25 V \n\nand 300 mA for 30 min. After that, the slide was gently neutralized with 0.4 M Tris \n\nbuffer at pH 7.5 three times and then stained with SYBR Safe 4\u00b5L/mL. All steps \n\ndescribed were performed under dark conditions to minimize additional ultraviolet \n\ninduced DNA damage. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n32 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\nThe slides were examined, and comet images were captured using a \n\nfluorescence microscope (Olympus BX41). Approximately 200 randomly selected \n\ncells were analyzed at 400x magnification per each animal. Extent of DNA migration \n\nwas determined using a computerized image analysis system (Comet Score TM - \n\nTriTek Corp).  \n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Micronucleus Assay \n \n\n \n\n At the time of sacrifice, bone-marrow cells from both femurs of each animal \n\nwere flushed with foetal calf serum, for the estimation of the frequency of \n\nmicronucleated PCEs, according to Schmid [99]. The obtained cell suspension was \n\ncentrifuged (800rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet re-\n\nsuspended in foetal calf serum. Then, a drop of the suspension was smeared on a \n\nclean slide, air-dried, fixed in methanol for 10 minutes and stained with AO for \n\nfluorescent microscopic examination (Olympus BX41, equipped with blue excitation \n\nand 515-530 nm barrier filter) with a magnification of 400\u00d7. The frequency of MN in \n\n1000 PCE per mouse (coded slides) was scored. The acridine orange (0.24mM in \n\nSorensen Buffer pH=6.8) used was prepared from a stock solution 0.1% AO \n\naccording to Krishna and Hayashi (2000) [97]. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay \n \n\nThe testis of the mice was dissected out, placed in 1 mL of Sorensen buffer (pH \n\n7.0) and gently centrifuged (800rpm, 10 min) to obtain a pellet of undamaged cells. \n\nAfter removal of the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL of Sorensen \n\nbuffer. A drop of the suspension was placed on a clean slide and a smear is made, \n\nair-dried and fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min. After drying overnight the slides \n\nwere stained with 10% Giemsa for 1 h [179] and observed under the microscope with \n\na magnification of 100\u00d7. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [113], 1000 sperm per \n\nanimal were assessed for morphological abnormalities, which included without hook, \n\nbanana shape, amorphous, folded on themselves and two tails. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n33 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\n2.4. Determination of Brain Acetylcholinesterase \nActivity \n \n\nThe brain acetylcholinesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically \n\naccording to Ellman et al. (1961) [180] in 10 Mus spretus and 10 Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone and 5 from BA zone). \n\nBefore enzyme reaction, 50 mg of each freeze-thawed brain sample were \n\nhomogenized in 0.9 mL of 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.1mL of \n\nTriton X-100 5% (v/v), using a Potter homogenizer.  \n\nThen, for the enzymatic assay, 25 \u00b5L of the homogenized brain were added to \n\nthe reaction mixture contained 50\u00b5L of DTNB (3.96mg/mL) and 1375 \u00b5L of 0.1M \n\nsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 50 \u00b5L of acetylthiocholine iodide \n\n(ACT) (9.248mg/ml) were added and the mixture was vortex for a few seconds. With \n\nthe addition of ACT, the enzymatic reaction begins and the reading in the Beckam \n\n640 spectrophotometer at 412 nm had to be immediate. All steps described were \n\nperformed under cold conditions, on ice, to minimize enzymatic activity before the \n\nenzymatic reaction begins. Changes in absorvance were recorded for a period of 3 \n\nminutes at intervals of 10 seconds. This enzymatic assay was always done in \n\ntriplicates and the enzymatic activity was expressed as \u00b5mol ACT hydrolyzed/min/g \n\nof brain and nmol ACT hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein. \n\nThe protein content of the homogenates was determined according to the \n\nmethod of Bradford [181] using bovine serum albumin as standard. \n \n\n2.5. Determination of Manganese in the Liver  \n \n\nAbout 150 mg of each sample of liver pre-stored at -70\u00baC from 10 Mus spretus \n\nand 10 Apodemus sylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone \n\nand 5 from BA zone) were defrosted and dried at 80\u00baC until reaching a constant \n\nweight. After that, dried samples were digested with 5 mL of 65% suprapure nitric \n\nacid during 3 hours at 150\u00baC. \n\nThe resulting clear acid solutions were transferred to 50 mL volumetric flasks \n\nthat were completed with deionized water. These solutions were used for the \n\ndetermination of Mn concentrations that were determined by GFAAS with a \n\nPerkinElmer AAnalyst\u2122 700 atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with an HGA \n\nGraphite Furnace and a programmable sample dispenser (AS 800 Auto Sampler and \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n34 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\nWinLab 32 for AA software). Mg(NO3)2?6 H2O (0.84 mol/L) was used as a chemical \n\nmodifier. Samples were measured at least twice and every measurement consisted \n\nof two separate injections into the graphite furnace.  \n\nResults were expressed as micrograms of Mn per gram of dry liver. Calibration \n\ncurves were automatically obtained by the device starting from a 25\u00b5g/L solution of \n\nMnCl2 that was successively diluted for 12.5, 6.3, and 2.5 \u00b5g Mn/L.

Preliminary Genotype Analysis \n \n\n For the genotype analysis of CYP1A1 polymorphism gene, it was used \n\nTissue DNA Kit (Omega bio-tek) for extraction of DNA in muscle tissues. After that, \n\nPolimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed for amplify samples of DNA, using \n\nspecific primers available on lab that flanking one region of CYP1A1 gene with 702 \n\nbp (Figure 13). It was used 15.5 \u00b5L of water, 5 \u00b5L of buffer (1x), 1 \u00b5L of dNTPs (2.5 \n\nmM), 1.5 \u00b5L of magnesium (1.5 mM), 0.2 \u00b5L of primers F and R (25 \u00b5M), 0.4 \u00b5L of \n\nBSA (0.16 \u00b5g/\u00b5L), 0.2 \u00b5L of Taq polymerase (5U/\u00b5L) and 1 \u00b5L of DNA, for a total \n\nreaction volume of 25 \u00b5L per tube. Thermal cycling conditions included a hot start at \n\n94\u00baC for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00baC for 1min, annealing at \n\n66\u00baC for 2 min and extension at 72\u00baC for 1 min. Final extension was performed at \n\n72\u00baC for 5 min. Then, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose \n\ngel. Moreover, two samples successful amplified was purified and then send for \n\nsequencing. \n \n\n \nFigure 33. Diagram of exons (rectangles) and introns (lines) of the mouse Cyp1A1 gene. \nThe primers used for PCR analysis are illustrated, which are designed to produce a genomic \nDNA PCR fragment of 702 bp. Numbers above denote base pairs (bp) of the exons and \nintrons [182]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n35 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods \n\n \n\nIn addition, successful amplified PCR products were digested during 3h at \n\n37\u00baC with restriction enzymes MseI and EcoRI, whose recognition sites are TTAA \n\nand GAATTC respectively, in order to assess if there was a differential cut. Through \n\nthe GenBank, it was possible to consult the sequence of the fragment amplified and \n\npredict the number of fragments originated by these enzymes: MseI should cut the \n\nfragment at two sites, forming three fragments and EcoRI should cut the fragment at \n\none site, forming two fragments. It was used 1 \u00b5L of 10x buffer, 2\u00b5L of DNA, 1 \u00b5L of \n\nMseI or 0.5 \u00b5L of EcoRI and 6 or 6.5 \u00b5L of water, respectively for a total reaction tube \n\nvolume of 10 \u00b5L. After digestion, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% \n\nagarose gel. \n\n \n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis \n \n\nThe statistical analysis of the two species captured was done separately \n\nbecause of the differences between them. The data were statistically analyzed using \n\nSPSS v.19.0. All variables were checked for normal distributions, using Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test. \n\nDifferences between conventional agriculture group and biological agriculture \n\ngroup were assessed with Student\u2019s t-test if they exhibited a normal distribution; if \n\nnot, the Mann-Whitney`s U-Test was used instead. Differences between males and \n\nfemales of each zone were always assessed. The significance of differences was \n\nexamined at the p-value of 0.05.  \n\nFor alignment and sequence analysis were used BioEdit and Sequencher 4.8 \n\nprograms.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n36 Chapter I: 3.Results \n\n3.

Discussion of Results \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPesticides are widely used in modern agriculture despite their hazards to \n\nhumans and to nature. They have played a key role in providing reliable agricultural \n\nproducts at prices affordable to consumers, improving the quality of produce, and \n\nensuring high profits to farmers. Theoretically, they are developed to function with \n\nreasonable certainty and minimal impact on human health and the environment. At \n\nEuropean level, according to 91/414/EEC Directive (Council Directive 91/414/EEC, \n\n1991), active substances in pesticides formulations are only approved for use if they \n\nhave undergone a peer-reviewed safety assessment [19]. Despite of that, serious \n\nconcerns have been raised about health risks resulting from exposure to these \n\napproved pesticides and numerous studies have been published in order to alert \n\nabout this [7,31, 183]. \n\nIn particular, the low reported acute toxicity and short environmental \n\npersistence of Mancozeb have allowed its worldwide usage in agriculture, even \n\nthough numerous effects of its chronic exposure have been reported. In fact, as \n\nstated before, Mancozeb has the capability to alter the function of thyroid [58, 59], \n\nimmune system [60], reproductive system [61-64] and nervous system [65]. \n\nMoreover, in a long-term experimental study, Belpoggi et al. (2002) verified that \n\nMancozeb is a multipotent carcinogen inducing a variety of tumors of different origins \n\nin rats [66]. Nevertheless, Mancozeb is included in the list (referred to as Annex I of \n\nthe Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991) of active substances that are considered \n\nacceptable in regard to their impact on the environment, human and animal health, \n\nand therefore authorized for use in pesticide formulations within the European \n\nCommunity [19]. \n\nThe present study clearly demonstrates that exposure to a mixture of \n\npesticide, where Mancozeb represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability \n\nto cause DNA damage in small mammals, assessed by comet, MN and sperm \n\nabnormality assays. These results are in accordance with other studies using comet \n\nassay [67], MN assay [184] as well as the sperm abnormality assay [185] to assess \n\nMancozeb genotoxicity. \n\nIn a situation of chronic exposure to a mixture of pesticides like that, it is \n\ndifficult to make sure that genotoxic effects detected are due to a particular pesticide. \n\nThe owner farmer from CA zone ensures that more than 50% of the pesticide \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n45 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\napplications were based on Mancozeb, an EBDC fungicide, but some OPs and \n\ncarbamates insecticides were also used. So, to verify if the genetic damage detected \n\nwould be due to this insecticides action, AChE activity was determined. AChE activity \n\nis widely used as a specific biomarker of these pesticides that are commonly used in \n\nagriculture [118] and if the small mammals analyzed were subjected to their action, \n\nAChE activity will be inhibited. In the present study, there were no significant \n\ndifferences between AChE activity for small animals from CA and BA zones that \n\ncould explain the significant differences of the genetic damage found in the same \n\nanimals. Thus, we can conclude that OPs or carbamates insecticides are not the \n\ngenotoxic agents at issue.  \n\nOn the other hand, to prove that Mancozeb, the most widely used pesticide in \n\nthe CA zone, was the genotoxic agent responsible to the DNA damage detected, it \n\nwould be necessary to prove that these animals were really exposed. Mancozeb is \n\nan EBDC with the presence of coordinated transitional metals and ETU is the specific \n\nmetabolite of these compounds resulting from a spontaneous breakdown. Therefore, \n\nETU quantification in urine has been widely used as a biomarker of exposure to \n\nMancozeb and others EBDCs[76]. However, in this study, it was not possible to use \n\nthis biomarker to assess exposure to Mancozeb because the amounts of urine \n\nobtained from small mammals were not sufficient to quantify ETU. To achieve this, it \n\nwould be necessary to keep animals in metabolic cages for several days, which was \n\nnot possible.  \n\nAlternatively, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS to indirectly quantify \n\nMancozeb inside the animal\u2019s body. Mancozeb is chemically characterized by the \n\npresence of coordinated transitional metals in the molecule, like Mn and Zn. Thus, \n\nmeasurement of these metals in biological tissues has been proposed as an \n\nalternative approach to monitor Mancozeb exposure. This application  may be very \n\nuseful for biological monitoring, since determination of metals can be performed with \n\nvery sensitive AAS methods which are of lower complexity than those required for \n\nmetabolite determination, like ETU [52]. Canossa et al. (1993) have already observed \n\nan increased urinary excretion of manganese in workers exposed to Mancozeb [186] \n\nbut  more research is needed because the available data, at present,  are not \n\nsufficient to validate the use of metals as biomarkers of exposure to Mancozeb [52]. \n\nIn addition, it is necessary to investigate the presence of metals not only in urine but \n\nalso in other tissues and biological fluids as potential biomarkers.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n46 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\nConsequently, in the present study, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS \n\nin small mammals\u2019 liver as a potential biomarker of Mancozeb exposure, because the \n\nliver is a filter organ where metals will be accumulated. As a result, it was found that \n\nboth species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from CA zone, exposed to \n\npesticides, with greater genetic damage, have also greater levels of the metal Mn, \n\ncomparing to animals from BA zone. So, considering that Mancozeb is the widely \n\nused pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be the source \n\nof the highest levels of Mn found in small mammals. In other words, it seems that \n\nMancozeb is the genotoxic agent which caused the DNA damage detected. \n\nIt is still important to note that, although results are not significant, there is a \n\ntendency for higher values of AChE activity in the CA zone compared to BA zone, \n\nwhich is not in line with expectations because CA zone is exposed to pesticides, \n\nincluding OPs and carbamates insecticides, which supposedly will inhibit the \n\nenzyme. However, it is known that AchE activity has to be determinated immediately \n\nafter exposure and during captures there were no pesticides applications. So, AchE \n\nactivity is not a good biomarker when the objective is to evaluate the long-term \n\nexposure. On the other hand, the presence of higher levels of Mn, as a consequence \n\nof the high amounts of Mancozeb used, can be related to these higher levels of \n\nAChE activity. In fact, Liapi et al. (2008) has recently suggests, in a short-term Mn \n\nadministration study, that Mn cause a significant increase in AChE activity in rats \n\n[137] and our results seem to be in concordance with these ones. Although Mn action \n\nis a complex process and is still very controversial, Mn exerts different effects on \n\nAChE activity in different stages of the life cycle [138]. \n\nDespite the evident genotoxic action of Mancozeb, the two analyzed species \n\nseems to be affected in a different away. While, for Mus spretus significant genetic \n\ndifferences were detected by the MN and sperm abnormality assays, for Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus significant genetic differences between animals from CA and BA were only \n\ndetected by comet assay. Comet, MN and sperm abnormality assays assess the \n\nDNA damage in different cells populations: comet assay evaluate the DNA damage \n\nin lymphocytes from the bloodstream, MN were detected in PCEs from bone marrow \n\nand sperm abnormalities were assessed in male germ cells. Thus, our results \n\nsuggest that the two species subject to the same genotoxic agents appear to have \n\npopulations of cells to be affected differently.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n47 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\nThe differential response to the same genotoxic agent may be due because \n\nthese two species have very different habits of life, including different feeding habits. \n\nMus spretus are exclusively herbivores, whereas Apodemus sylvaticus are more \n\nomnivorous and their diets may include a large fraction of arthropods. Thus, the \n\nintensity and the frequency of the animal`s exposure to pesticides will be different in \n\nthe two species because different foods will have different levels of these chemicals. \n\nOn the other hand, different responses to genotoxic agents may only reflect intrinsic \n\ndifferences of species rather than differences related to exposure that was already \n\ncorroborated in previous studies [187, 188]. \n\nIt would be expected that Comet assay was a more sensitive test than MN \n\nassay because there are a lot of studies that confirm the ability of comet assay to \n\ndetect the effect of genotoxic agents at lower doses than the MN assay. However, \n\ntaking into account the present study, it seems that this sensibility depend on the \n\nspecies concerned. For Mus spretus, MN assays was the ability to detect significant \n\ndifferences in DNA damage between small mammals from CA and BA zones that \n\nwere not detected by Comet Assay. MN assay using AO as staining method is more \n\nuseful and gives more reliable results than the usual Giemsa staining because both \n\nPCEs and a MN can be easily distinguished. So, MN assay using AO staining has \n\nalso a good sensibility that should be considered.  \n\nOn the other hand, the sensitivity difference between the comet assay and MN \n\nassay may be due to their different endpoints. MN assay determines unrepaired DNA \n\nstrand breaks, while the comet assay determines strand breaks (single and/ or \n\ndouble) and labile sites that are subsequently removed by repair enzymes [189]. \n\nComet assay can determine the short-lived DNA damage while the MN assay detects \n\nthe structural and numerical chromosomal damage [97, 190]. Thus, like several \n\nreports suggests, a combination of this two assays might therefore be recommended \n\nto understand the mechanisms underlying mutagenicity and to improve the sensibility \n\nas well as reliability of detection which can better facilitate the risk assessment \n\nprocess [191].  \n\nFurthermore, a combination of these two assays with the sperm abnormality \n\nassay is also very useful because it is a fast and sensitive mutagenicity test [113] \n\nused to detect cytogenetic damage in germ cells further than somatic cells. However, \n\nthe classification used in this test is somewhat subjective with many technical \n\nartifacts and, therefore, it has not been widely used in recent times. For example, in \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n48 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\nthe present study, we have to discard the category \u201cfolded on themselves\u201d of the \n\nsperm abnormalities classification because there was found an abnormal percentage \n\nof sperm cells in this category for all the animals due possibly to a very high \n\ncentrifugal speed. Nevertheless, we find significant differences in the percentage of \n\nsperm abnormalities in Mus spretus from CA zone, comparing to BA zone, but there \n\nwere no significant differences for Apodemus sylvaticus. It is important to refer that \n\nthis result can be due to the reduced number of males Apodemus sylvaticus \n\ncaptured: only six males in CA zone and two males in BA zone. In fact, a larger \n\nsampler would be essentially for more reliable results not only for sperm abnormality \n\nassay but also for the other genotoxic tests, especially in wild species like these \n\nbecause the variability among animals can be higher than in laboratory animals. \n\nOur study clearly showed that the use of only one cytogenetic end point is not \n\nsufficient to understand the range of the effects of pesticides on the genetic material \n\nin an in situ study. However, when other end points are included like in the present \n\nstudy, the method can be very promising. Moreover, because of differences in \n\nsensitivities, it is important to have more than one species for comparison to \n\nestablish a genotoxic profile of one area.   \n\nAbout morphophisiological analysis, it will be expected that animals from \n\ncontaminated zone (CA zone) would have lower values for body measurements \n\ncomparing to uncontaminated zone (BA zone). In fact, there have been recognized \n\nmorphological changes in organisms as a result of environmental pollution and body \n\nmeasurements, internal organs mass as well as hematological parameters are \n\ncommonly used to assess the health status of wild species exposed to any kind of \n\npollution [162, 163]. So, it will be expected that exposure to pesticides had influence \n\non animals development and consequently on animal size. However, there were no \n\nsignificant differences for body measurements between animals from CA and BA \n\nzones for both species. Significant differences were only found in some internal \n\norgans mass: Mus spretus from CA zone have significant lower values of relative \n\nweight testis comparing to animals from BA zone. Moreover, significant differences \n\nwere also found in relative weight spleen for Mus spretus, where animals from CA \n\nzone have bigger spleens than animals from BA zone. This is in line with \n\nexpectations because spleen has an important immune function and bigger \n\ndimensions are indicative of an infection response that could be caused by pesticides \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n49 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\nexposure. In fact, splenic hyperplasia were already detected in mice after \n\nadministration of some pesticides [192].  \n\nSignificant differences were also found in relative weight liver for Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus, but this is not in line with expectations because animals from BA zone \n\nhave bigger livers than CA zone. Liver is a filter organ, filtering xenobiotic agents and \n\nare involved on metabolism and detoxification of this compounds. So, it would be \n\nexpected that animals from CA zone, exposed to pesticides, had a hyperplasic liver \n\nin order to provide as far as possible a satisfactory degradation of xenobiotics. This \n\ntendency for bigger livers in animals from BA zone only happened in the species \n\nApodemus sylvaticus and it may be due to the presence of other xenobiotic agents. \n\nRegarding hematological parameters, several studies have reported changes \n\nin those parameters as a consequence of pesticides exposure [192-194]. In the \n\npresent study, significant results were only found for Hgb, MCH and MCHC \n\nparameters in Mus spretus species. These parameters are all related to hemoglobin \n\nand are higher in small mammals from CA zone that is not in line with expectations \n\nbecause pesticides seem to cause a decrease in hemoglobin content. It is important \n\nto refer that Beckman Coulter Act Diff Hematology Analyzer, the apparatus used to \n\nobtain these results, showed some inconsistencies in the provided values, so we \n\nmust consider the hypothesis of these values are not the real ones. \n\nIn relation to genotype analysis, we were able to amplify CYP1A1 in Mus \n\nspretus species but not in Apodemus sylvaticus. This is because the available \n\nprimers were nor adequate to amplify this gene in Apodemus sylvaticus genome. \n\nThus, to do an analysis of this kind, it is essential to start by drawing new primers that \n\nallowing the amplification of this genome region and then optimize the PCR \n\ntechnique as was done for Mus spretus. We only amplified the genome of ten Mus \n\nspretus from CA and BA zones and then only two samples were sequenced due to \n\neconomic constraints. To obtain some reliable results it would be necessary to \n\nanalyze much more individuals. However, comparing the two sequences amplified, \n\none from CA zone and another from BA zone, it was found that they differ on only \n\none base pair. So, this region of the genome seems to be very conservative between \n\nindividuals and we cannot conclude that this difference is a SNP because we only \n\ncompared two animals and this difference can be only genetic diversity between \n\nindividuals of the same species. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n50 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\n Moreover, some samples were cut with two restriction enzymes, MseI and \n\nEcoRI, to research any possible polymorphism. These enzymes cut in the expected \n\nsites and there were no differences between animals from CA and BA zone. Only a \n\nsmall number of samples were tested due to economic constraint because enzymes \n\nare very expensive, so we cannot take conclusions.  \n\nIt will be important to investigate specific polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 \n\ngenes, like CYP1A1, involved in the xenobiotic\u00b4s metabolism because individuals \n\nwith unfavorable metabolizing alleles can be more susceptible to genotoxic effects of \n\nxenobiotic agents, like pesticides, that can lead to an increased probability to \n\ndeveloping cancer. Thus, the research of susceptibility biomarkers will be \n\nfundamental to the diagnosis and prevention of the disease. \n\nIn situ studies like the present that compares bioindicator species from a \n\nconventional agriculture zone versus a biological agriculture zone can be extremely \n\nimportant in assessing the toxicity of pesticides to humans. Even though the general \n\npopulation is not as exposed as animals because they only contact to pesticides \n\nthrough the consumption of agricultural products while animals live in the fields and \n\nare directly subjected to pesticide applications, the evaluation of the toxicological risk \n\nof pesticides in this way for humans is quite acceptable and more realistic than \n\nanimal laboratory experiments. In fact, it is known that many pesticides are \n\ntransformed in the environment through physical, chemical and biological processes \n\nwhich are intended to detoxify them but often the transformation process forms \n\nproducts that are more toxic than the parent [195]. Moreover, it is not feasible to \n\npredict the toxicity of pesticide mixtures on the basis of the results of the toxicity of \n\nsingle components because the effects of a mixture of pesticides are often different \n\nfrom the individual effects of a single components [196] and human exposure is \n\nrarely limited to a single compound. So, in situ studies are obviously closer to the real \n\nsituation and must be considered in the pesticide approval process. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture \n\neven with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like \n\nMancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. \n\nDespite all the controversy, biological agriculture has been adopted by an increasing \n\nnumber of farmers, like the farmer who collaborated in this study, and they believe \n\nthat this practice has the potential for mass production of the amount of calories \n\nneeded to feed humanity. We do not know if this is possible but it is urgent to find \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n51 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results \n\nand develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the \n\nuse of pesticides, which represents a real global problem. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n52  Chapter I: 5.Final Remarks and Future Perspectives \n\n \n\n5. Final Remarks and Future Perspectives \n \n\n \n? The present work contributes to alert about hazard effects resulting from \n\npesticide exposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally authorized for \n\nuse in European Community; \n \n\n? As revealed by the three cytogenetic endpoints used, Mancozeb is capable of \n\ninducing DNA damage in Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus species; \n \n\n? The use of several tests is essential to have a full picture of the genotoxic \n\neffects especially in wild species since the variability among animals can be \n\nhigher than in laboratory animals; \n \n\n? The use at least two sympatric species to detect the presence of genotoxic \n\nagents is essential because there may be a difference in sensitivity of the \n\nspecies selected as bioindicators in relation to the cytogenetic end points \n\nanalyzed; \n \n\n? Morphophisiological analysis was not able to detect pesticide toxicity. Only the \n\nincreased spleens reveled clearly the consequences of pesticide exposure; \n \n\n? AChE activity  is not a good biomarker when the objective is to evaluate the \n\nlong-term exposure to a mixture of pesticides, where some pesticides like \n\nMancozeb can have components, which interfere with AChE activity; \n \n\n? Mn quantification seems to be a good biomarker of exposure to Mancozeb and \n\nmore research is needed to validate the metal quantifications as biomarkers of \n\nexposure to this type of pesticides; \n \n\n? The present results provide reference values for the analyzed biomarkers \n\nallowing future comparisons with other small mammals\u2019 populations. \n \n\n? M. spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus are suitable bioindicator species of \n\npesticide pollution, demonstrating variation in morphological, biochemical and \n\ngenotoxic effects of exposure; \n \n\n? To determine CYP1A1 polymorphisms, that could be genetic markers of \n\nsusceptibility to genotoxic agents\u2019 action, it is necessary to continue the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n53  Chapter I: 5.Final Remarks and Future Perspectives \n\npreliminary genotype analysis described, analyzing more animals and \n\nexploring different primers and enzymes; \n \n\n? Finally, despite Mancozeb toxicity, it will belong to the most widely used \n\npesticide in the world due to their efficacy, and low relatively low cost and \n\npersistence in the environment. As a result, a large part of the population will \n\ncontinue to be exposed, and concerns for their known and potentially newly \n\ndiscovered adverse effects will remain alive. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n54  Chapter I: 6.References \n\n \n\n6.

Biological agriculture can represent a valuable option, \n\navoiding the use of pesticides, but it does not appear to have the potential to respond \n\nto the mass production of food to feed humanity.   \n\nMancozeb is a widely used fungicide mainly because of its low acute toxicity in \n\nmammals and scarce persistence in the environment. However, it has been \n\nconsidered a multipotent carcinogen, mutagenic and possibly teratogenic in a long-\n\nterm exposure context.  \n\nSmall mammals can be used as bioindicators of environmental toxicity of \n\npesticides, accumulating a wide spectrum of pollutants, and significant correlations \n\nbetween pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have already been \n\ndetected.  \n\nThe main aim of this study was the in situ assessment of Mancozeb \n\ngenotoxicity, using two small mammals\u2019 species (Mus spretus and Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus) from a conventional agriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) \n\nzone. It was found that exposure to a mixture of pesticide, where Mancozeb \n\nrepresents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability to cause DNA damage in \n\nsmall mammals, assessed by comet, micronucleus and sperm abnormality assays. \n\nMoreover, both species, exposed to pesticides, with greater genetic damage, have \n\nalso greater levels of Manganese. Thus, we can conclude that Mancozeb, the source \n\nof the highest levels of manganese found in small mammals, is the genotoxic agent \n\nat issue.  \n\nIn conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture \n\neven with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like \n\nMancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. It is \n\nurgent to find and develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to \n\nminimize the use of pesticides, which represents a real global problem. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: Mancozeb, Biomarkers of Genotoxicity, Mus Spretus, Apodemus \nsylvaticus, Mn quantification.  \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n68 \nChapter II: 1.Introduction \n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n \n\nThe widespread use of pesticides is affecting the entire planet, including the \n\nhuman health [1-3] and conventional agriculture is largely responsible for the \n\nincreased consumption of pesticides worldwide [4]. In Portugal, according to Eurostat \n\n[5], sales of pesticides have been increased in the last years and more than 17000 \n\ntones were sold in 2008. \n\nPesticides can be considered an economic, labor-saving, and efficient tool of \n\npest management [6] and they are developed through very strict regulation \n\nprocesses to function with reasonable certainty and minimal impact on human health \n\nand the environment [7-9]. Even though the published results are not always in \n\nagreement with this and serious concerns have been raised about health risks \n\nresulting not only from occupational exposure to pesticides but also from pesticides \n\nresidues on food, for the general population [10]. Consequently, in the last years, \n\nadditional efforts have been produced to reduce the use of pesticides and biological \n\nagriculture can represent a valuable option, avoiding the use of pesticides. \n\nNevertheless, it does not appear to have the potential to respond to the mass \n\nproduction of food to feed humanity [11] and it deserves wide experimentation to fully \n\nunderstand its potentialities, constraints and limitations [12].  \n\nMancozeb, an ethylenebisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) is a widely used fungicide \n\nto protect fruits, vegetables and field crops against a large spectrum of fungal \n\ndiseases. It is one of the most widely used commercial fungicides worldwide [13], \n\nmainly because of its low acute toxicity in mammals and scarce persistence in the \n\nenvironment [14]. Although, Mancozeb, mainly through its degradation product \n\nethylenethiourea (ETU), has been reported to produce significant toxicological effects \n\non thyroid [15, 16], immune system [17], reproductive system [18-21] and nervous \n\nsystem [22]. Moreover, Mancozeb was considered mutagenic [23], teratogenic [24] \n\nand a multipotent carcinogen, inducing a variety of tumors of different origin in rats \n\nafter chronic exposure [25]. In addition, Mn, a coordinated transitional metal \n\nconstituent of Mancozeb, is also a proven mutagen, causing DNA damage and \n\nchromosome aberrations [26]. \n\nThe environmental genotoxicity of pesticides can be investigated in small \n\nmammals in the fields because they are able to accumulate a wide spectrum of \n\npollutants which are present in the ecosystem [27] and, particularly, some significant \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n69 \nChapter II: 1.Introduction \n\ncorrelations between pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have been \n\ndetected [28]. Moreover, small mammals, mostly rodents, have enough genetic and \n\nphysiological similarities with humans and, therefore, it allows extrapolating the effect \n\nof these pollutants.  \n\nThe main aim of this study is the in situ assessment of pesticides genotoxicity, \n\nparticularly Mancozeb, in two small mammal`s species from a conventional \n\nagriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) zone. The wild small mammal \n\nspecies, Algerian mouse (Mus spretus, Lataste, 1883) and Wood mouse (Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus, Linnaeus, 1758) were chosen in this study as pesticide pollution \n\nbioindicators. These species have been widely used as a bioindicators in some \n\nenvironmental studies [29-33]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n70 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods \n\n2. Material and Methods \n \n\n \n\n2.1. Study Areas \n \n\nThis study was carried out in an agricultural zone of Alcoba\u00e7a, district of Leiria, \n\nPortugal. In this region, agriculture is still an important economic activity with a wide \n\narea under agricultural practice. Animals were captured from conventional and \n\nbiological agriculture zones. It was considered that these zones are both insert in the \n\nsame biotope (?1km of distance between them) and it was presumed that pesticide \n\nuse is the main external factor that distinguishes them. The biological agriculture \n\nzone is correctly isolated from adjacent agriculture zones, so it is expected that it \n\ncannot be affected by adjacent pesticides applications. \n\nBefore animals capture, the agreement and the cooperation of the farmers \n\ninvolved were required and they were asked about pesticides and others chemical \n\nproducts that were used in the fields. While in biological agriculture (BA) zone, the \n\nowner farmer ensured that there were not used any type of chemical products, being \n\nan agricultural practice based on the use of natural enemies for the pest control, that \n\nwas converted about 5 years ago, in conventional agriculture (CA) zone, the owner \n\nfarmer guarantee that more than 50% of the applications were based on one EBDC: \n\nMancozeb.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Mice Sampling and Sacrifice \n \n\nA total of 46 small mammals of both sexes were captured between December \n\n2010 and February 2011 in both zones. All the animals were treated according to the \n\nDirective 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 \n\nSeptember 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes [34]. Small \n\nmammals were captured with Sherman traps using a mixture of canned sardine, flour \n\nand oil as bait. Cotton was also placed inside each trap to minimize lower \n\ntemperatures that were felt during the night. Pregnant or lactant females were \n\ndischarged as well as animals with less than 10g of weight. Mice were housed in \n\nindividual plastic cages until reach the laboratory with ad libitum access to food and \n\nwater.  \n\nAnimals were anesthetized and weighed before sacrifice. Cardiac puncture \n\nwas done for blood collection, using a syringe with heparin to prevent coagulation \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n71 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods \n\nand, during dissection liver, brain,femurs and testis were removed. Livers and brains \n\nwere stored at -70\u00baC before subsequent analysis. \n\n \n\n2.3. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity  \n \n\n2.3.1. Comet Assay \n \n\nThe comet assay was performed as described by Singh et al. [35] with minor \n\nmodifications. An aliquot of 15 \u00b5L of the blood samples collected by cardiac puncture \n\nwas mixed with 300 \u00b5L 0.8% low-melting point agarose (37\u00baC) and then placed on a \n\nslide precoated with 1% normal-melting-point agarose. Immediately after that, the \n\nslide was covered with a coverslip and was then kept for 5 minutes on ice to solidify. \n\nAfter gently removing the coverslip, subsequent to solidification, slide was immersed \n\nin a cold lysing solution (2.5M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA, 10mM Tris, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 \n\nand 10% (v/v) DMSO) at 4\u00baC over night. After lysis, the slide was placed in a \n\nhorizontal electrophoresis box. The box was filled with fresh electrophoresis solution \n\n(1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH?13) and the slide was left in this solution for 40 min \n\nto allow unwinding. Electrophoresis was performed using the same solution at 25 V \n\nand 300 mA for 30 min. After that, the slide was gently neutralized with 0.4 M Tris \n\nbuffer at pH 7.5 three times and then stained with SYBR Safe 4\u00b5L/mL. All steps \n\ndescribed were performed under dark conditions to minimize additional ultraviolet \n\ninduced DNA damage. \n\nThe slides were examined, and comet images were captured using a \n\nfluorescence microscope (Olympus BX41). Approximately 200 randomly selected \n\ncells were analyzed at 400x magnification per each animal. Extent of DNA migration \n\nwas determined using a computerized image analysis system (Comet Score TM - \n\nTriTek Corp).  \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Micronucleus Assay using Acridine Orange \n \n\n At the time of sacrifice, bone-marrow cells from both femurs of each \n\nanimal were flushed with foetal calf serum, for the estimation of the frequency of \n\nmicronucleated PCEs, according to Schmid [36]. The obtained cell suspension was \n\ncentrifuged (800rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet re-\n\nsuspended in foetal calf serum. Then, a drop of the suspension was smeared on a \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n72 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods \n\nclean slide, air-dried, fixed in methanol for 10 minutes and stained with AO for \n\nfluorescent microscopic examination (Olympus BX41, equipped with blue excitation \n\nand 515-530 nm barrier filter) with a magnification of 400\u00d7. The frequency of MN in \n\n1000 PCE per mouse (coded slides) was scored. The acridine orange (0.24mM in \n\nSorensen Buffer pH=6.8) used was prepared from a stock solution of acridine orange \n\n0.1% according to Krishna and Hayashi (2000) [37]. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay \n \n\nThe testis of the mice was dissected out, placed in 1 mL of Sorensen buffer \n\n(pH 7.0) and gently centrifuged (800rpm, 10 min) to obtain a pellet of undamaged \n\ncells. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL of \n\nSorensen buffer. A drop of the suspension was placed on a clean slide and a smear \n\nis made, air-dried and fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min. After drying overnight \n\nthe slides were stained with 10% Giemsa for 1 h [38] and observed under the \n\nmicroscope with a magnification of 100\u00d7. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [39], 1000 \n\nsperm per animal were assessed for morphological abnormalities, which included \n\nwithout hook, banana shape, amorphous, folded on themselves and two tails. \n\n \n\n2.4. Determination of Manganese in the Liver  \n \n\nAbout 150 mg of each sample of liver pre-stored at -70\u00baC from 10 Mus spretus \n\nand 10 Apodemus sylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone \n\nand 5 from BA zone) were defrosted and dried at 80\u00baC until reaching a constant \n\nweight. After that, dried samples were digested with 5 mL of 65% suprapure nitric \n\nacid during 3 hours at 150\u00baC. \n\nThe resulting clear acid solutions were transferred to 50mL volumetric flasks \n\nthat were completed with deionized water. These solutions were used for the \n\ndetermination of Mn concentrations that were determined by Graphite Furnance \n\nAtomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) with a PerkinElmer AAnalyst\u2122 700 atomic \n\nabsorption spectrometer equipped with an HGA Graphite Furnace and a \n\nprogrammable sample dispenser (AS 800 Auto Sampler and WinLab 32 for AA \n\nsoftware). Mg(NO3)2?6 H2O (0.84 mol/L) was used as a chemical modifier. Samples \n\nwere measured at least twice and every measurement consisted of two separate \n\ninjections into the graphite furnace.  \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n73 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods \n\nResults were expressed as micrograms of Mn per gram of dry liver. Calibration \n\ncurves were automatically obtained by the device starting from a 25\u00b5g/L solution of \n\nMnCl2 that was successively diluted for 12.5, 6.3, and 2.5 \u00b5g Mn/L. The limit of \n\ndetection was 0.05 \u00b5g Mn/L.  \n\n \n\n2.5. Statistical Analysis \n \n\nThe statistical analysis of the two species captured was done separately \n\nbecause of the differences between them. The data were statistically analyzed using \n\nSPSS v.19.0. All variables were checked for normal distributions, using Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test (Lilliefors significance correction). \n\nDifferences between conventional agriculture group and biological agriculture \n\ngroup were assessed with Student\u2019s t-test if they exhibited a normal distribution; if \n\nnot, the Mann-Whitney`s U-Test was used instead. Differences between males and \n\nfemales of each zone were always assessed. The significance of differences was \n\nexamined at the p-value of 0.05.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n74 Chapter II: 3.Results \n\n3.

Discussion of Results \n \n\nPesticides are widely used in modern agriculture despite their hazards to \n\nhumans and to nature. They have played a key role in providing reliable agricultural \n\nproducts at prices affordable to consumers, improving the quality of produce, and \n\nensuring high profits to farmers. Theoretically, they are developed to function with \n\nminimal impacts on human health and the environment. At European level, according \n\nto 91/414/EEC Directive (Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991), active substances in \n\npesticides formulations are only approved for use if they have undergone a peer-\n\nreviewed safety assessment [8]. Despite of that, serious concerns have been raised \n\nabout health risks resulting from exposure to these approved pesticides and \n\nnumerous studies have been published in order to alert about this [40-42]. \n\nIn particular, the low reported acute toxicity and short environmental \n\npersistence of Mancozeb have allowed its worldwide usage in agriculture, even \n\nthough numerous effects of its chronic exposure have been reported. In fact, as \n\nstated before, Mancozeb has the capability to alter the function of thyroid [15, 16], \n\nimmune system [17], reproductive system [18-21] and nervous system [22]. \n\nMoreover, in a long-term experimental study, Belpoggi et al. (2002) verified that \n\nMancozeb is a multipotent carcinogen inducing a variety of tumors of different origins \n\nin rats [25]. Nevertheless, Mancozeb is included in the list (referred to as Annex I of \n\nthe Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991) of active substances that are considered \n\nacceptable in regard to their impact on the environment, human and animal health, \n\nand therefore authorized for use in pesticide formulations within the European \n\nCommunity [8]. \n\nThe present study clearly demonstrates that exposure to a mixture of \n\npesticide, where Mancozeb represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability \n\nto cause DNA damage in small mammals, assessed by comet, MN and sperm \n\nabnormality assays. These results are in accordance with other studies using comet \n\nassay [23], MN assay [43] as well as the sperm abnormality assay [44] to assess \n\nMancozeb genotoxicity. \n\nTo guarantee that Mancozeb, the most widely used pesticide in the CA zone, \n\nwas the genotoxic agent responsible to the DNA damage detected, it would be \n\nnecessary to prove that these animals were really exposed. Mancozeb is an EBDC \n\nwith the presence of coordinated transitional metals and ETU is the specific \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n79 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results \n\nmetabolite of these compounds resulting from a spontaneous breakdown. Therefore, \n\nETU quantification in urine has been widely used as a biomarker of exposure to \n\nMancozeb and others EBDCs [45]. However, in this study, it was not possible to use \n\nthis biomarker to assess exposure to Mancozeb because the amounts of urine \n\nobtained from small mammals were not sufficient to quantify ETU. To achieve this, it \n\nwould be necessary to keep animals in metabolic cages for several days, which was \n\nnot possible.  \n\nAlternatively, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS to indirectly quantify \n\nMancozeb inside the animal\u2019s body. Mancozeb is chemically characterized by the \n\npresence of coordinated transitional metals in the molecule, like Mn and Zn. Thus, \n\nmeasurement of these metals in biological tissues has been proposed as an \n\nalternative approach to monitor Mancozeb exposure. This application may be very \n\nuseful for biological monitoring, since determination of metals can be performed with \n\nvery sensitive AAS methods which are of lower complexity than those required for \n\nmetabolite determination, like ETU [14]. Canossa et al. (1993) have already observed \n\nan increased urinary excretion of manganese in workers exposed to Mancozeb [46] \n\nbut more research is needed because the available data, at present, are not \n\nsufficient to validate the use of metals as biomarkers of exposure to Mancozeb [14]. \n\nIn addition, it is necessary to investigate the presence of metals not only in urine but \n\nalso in other tissues and biological fluids as potential biomarkers.  \n\nConsequently, in the present study, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS \n\nin small mammals\u2019 liver as a potential biomarker of Mancozeb exposure, because the \n\nliver is a filter organ where metals will be accumulated. As a result, it was found that \n\nboth species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from CA zone, exposed to \n\npesticides, with greater genetic damage, have also greater levels of the metal Mn, \n\ncomparing to animals from BA zone. So, considering that Mancozeb is the widely \n\nused pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be the source \n\nof the highest levels of Mn found in small mammals. In other words, it seems that \n\nMancozeb is the genotoxic agent which caused the DNA damage detected. \n\nDespite the evident genotoxic action of Mancozeb, the two analyzed species \n\nseems to be affected in a different away. While, for Mus spretus significant genetic \n\ndifferences were detected by the MN and sperm abnormality assays, for Apodemus \n\nsylvaticus significant genetic differences between animals from CA and BA were only \n\ndetected by comet assay. Comet, MN and sperm abnormality assays assess the \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n80 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results \n\nDNA damage in different cells populations: comet assay evaluate the DNA damage \n\nin lymphocytes from the bloodstream, MN were detected in PCEs from bone marrow \n\nand sperm abnormalities were assessed in male germ cells. Thus, our results \n\nsuggest that the two species subject to the same genotoxic agents seem to have \n\npopulations of cells to be affected differently.  \n\nThe differential response to the same genotoxic agent may be due because \n\nthese two species have very different habits of life, including different feeding habits. \n\nMus spretus are exclusively herbivores, whereas Apodemus sylvaticus are more \n\nomnivorous and their diets may include a large fraction of arthropods. Thus, the \n\nintensity and the frequency of the animal`s exposure to pesticides will be different in \n\nthe two species because different foods will have different levels of these chemicals. \n\nOn the other hand, different responses to genotoxic agents may only reflect intrinsic \n\ndifferences of species rather than differences related to exposure that was already \n\ncorroborated in previous studies [47, 48]. \n\nIt would be expected that Comet assay was a more sensitive test than MN \n\nassay because there are a lot of studies that confirm the ability of comet assay to \n\ndetect the effect of genotoxic agents at lower doses than the MN assay. However, \n\ntaking into account the present study, it seems that this sensibility depend on the \n\nspecies concerned. For Mus spretus, MN assays was the ability to detect significant \n\ndifferences in DNA damage between small mammals from CA and BA zones that \n\nwere not detected by Comet Assay. MN assay using AO as staining method is more \n\nuseful and gives more reliable results than the usual Giemsa staining because both \n\nPCEs and a MN can be easily distinguished. So, MN assay using AO staining has \n\nalso a good sensibility that should be considered.  \n\nOn the other hand, the sensitivity difference between the comet assay and MN \n\nassay may be due to their different endpoints. MN assay determines unrepaired DNA \n\nstrand breaks, while the comet assay determines strand breaks (single and/ or \n\ndouble) and labile sites that are subsequently removed by repair enzymes [49]. \n\nComet assay can determine the short-lived DNA damage while the MN assay detects \n\nthe structural and numerical chromosomal damage [37, 50]. Thus, like several \n\nreports suggests, a combination of this two assays might therefore be recommended \n\nto understand the mechanisms underlying mutagenicity and to improve the sensibility \n\nas well as reliability of detection which can better facilitate the risk assessment \n\nprocess [51].  \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n81 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results \n\nFurthermore, a combination of these two assays with the sperm abnormality \n\nassay is also very useful because it is a fast and sensitive mutagenicity test [39] used \n\nto detect cytogenetic damage in germ cells further than somatic cells. However, the \n\nclassification used in this test is somewhat subjective with many technical artifacts \n\nand, therefore, it has not been widely used in recent times. Nevertheless, we find \n\nsignificant differences in the percentage of sperm abnormalities in Mus spretus from \n\nCA zone, comparing to BA zone, but there were no significant differences for \n\nApodemus sylvaticus. It is important to refer that this result can be due to the \n\nreduced number of males Apodemus sylvaticus captured: only six males in CA zone \n\nand two males in BA zone. In fact, a larger sampler would be essentially for more \n\nreliable results not only for sperm abnormality assay but also for the other genotoxic \n\ntests, especially in wild species like these because the variability among animals can \n\nbe higher than in laboratory animals. \n\nOur study clearly showed that the use of only one cytogenetic end point is not \n\nsufficient to understand the range of the effects of pesticides on the genetic material \n\nin an in situ study. However, when other end points are included like in the present \n\nstudy, the method can be very promising. Moreover, because of differences in \n\nsensitivities, it is important to have more than one species for comparison to \n\nestablish a genotoxic profile of one area.   \n\nIn situ studies like the present that compares bioindicator species from a \n\nconventional agriculture zone versus a biological agriculture zone can be extremely \n\nimportant in assessing the toxicity of pesticides to humans. Even though the general \n\npopulation is not as exposed as animals because they only contact to pesticides \n\nthrough the consumption of agricultural products while animals live in the fields and \n\nare directly subjected to pesticide applications, the evaluation of the toxicological risk \n\nof pesticides in this way for humans is quite acceptable and more realistic than \n\nanimal laboratory experiments. In fact, it is known that many pesticides are \n\ntransformed in the environment through physical, chemical and biological processes \n\nwhich are intended to detoxify them but often the transformation process forms \n\nproducts that are more toxic than the parent [52]. Moreover, it is not feasible to \n\npredict the toxicity of pesticide mixtures on the basis of the results of the toxicity of \n\nsingle components because the effects of a mixture of pesticides are often different \n\nfrom the individual effects of a single components [53] and human exposure is rarely \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n82 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results \n\nlimited to a single compound. So, in situ studies are obviously closer to the real \n\nsituation and must be considered in the pesticide approval process. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture \n\neven with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like \n\nMancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. \n\nDespite all the controversy, biological agriculture has been adopted by an increasing \n\nnumber of farmers, like the farmer who collaborated in this study, and they believe \n\nthat this practice has the potential for mass production of the amount of calories \n\nneeded to feed humanity. We do not know if this is possible but it is urgent to find \n\nand develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the \n\nuse of pesticides, which represents a real global problem. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n83 Chapter II: 5.Final Remarks \n\n \n\n5. Final Remarks  \n \n\n\u2022 The present work contributes to alert about hazard effects resulting from pesticide \n\nexposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally authorized for use in European \n\ncommunity; \n\n\u2022 As revealed by the three cytogenetic endpoints used, Mancozeb is capable of \n\ninducing DNA damage in Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus species; \n\n\u2022 The use of several tests is essential to have a full picture of the genotoxic effects \n\nespecially in wild species since the variability among animals can be higher than in \n\nlaboratory animals; \n\n\u2022 The use at least two sympatric species to detect the presence of genotoxic agents \n\nis essential because there may be a difference in sensitivity of the species selected \n\nas bioindicators in relation to the cytogenetic end points analyzed; \n\n\u2022 Mn quantification seems to be a good biomarker of exposure to Mancozeb and \n\nmore research is needed to validate the metal quantifications as biomarkers of \n\nexposure to this type of pesticides; \n\n\u2022 The present results provide reference values for the analyzed biomarkers allowing \n\nfuture comparisons with other small mammals\u2019 populations. \n\n\u2022 Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus are suitable bioindicator species of pesticide \n\npollution, demonstrating variation in morphological, biochemical and genotoxic \n\neffects of exposure; \n\n\u2022 Finally, despite Mancozeb toxicity, it will belong to the most widely used pesticide in \n\nthe world due to their efficacy, and low relatively low cost and persistence in the \n\nenvironment. As a result, a large part of the population will continue to be exposed, \n\nand concerns for their known and potentially newly discovered adverse effects will \n\nremain alive.  \n\n\n\n \n  \n \n\n \nTese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente \n\n84 Chapter II: 6.References \n\n6.
