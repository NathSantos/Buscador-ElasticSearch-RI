Neste cen\u00e1rio, estudos sobre modelagem ecol\u00f3gica de nicho (ENM) t\u00eam sido cada vez mais utilizados para entender os processos de invas\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica e como uma importante ferramenta preditiva para orientar a\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o e para a compila\u00e7\u00e3o de listas negras de esp\u00e9cies com alto risco de invas\u00e3o. Informa\u00e7\u00f5es detalhadas sobre o processo de introdu\u00e7\u00e3o, coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e propaga\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies invasoras podem ainda ser levantadas atrav\u00e9s de estudos da composi\u00e7\u00e3o e estrutura gen\u00e9tica das popula\u00e7\u00f5es englobando a \u00e1rea nativa e invadida. Em se tratando de plantas clonais, o conhecimento sobre o papel da diversidade gen\u00e9tica para o estabelecimento e expans\u00e3o de \u00e1rea de vida de esp\u00e9cies invasoras ainda \u00e9 incipiente, o que aumenta a relev\u00e2ncia destes estudos. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 crescente a import\u00e2ncia de estudos que avaliem as respostas funcionais de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas para antecipar os efeitos das novas condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas sobre a din\u00e2mica da invas\u00e3o. Neste contexto, a presente tese teve como objetivo principal entender o processo de invas\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica Furcraea foet\u00edda (Asparagaceae) no Brasil, investigar o potencial atual de sua expans\u00e3o e entender como um aumento da temperatura atmosf\u00e9rica poder\u00e1 afetar seu potencial de invas\u00e3o. Furcraea foet\u00edda \u00e9 nativa da Am\u00e9rica Central e norte da Am\u00e9rica do Sul. A esp\u00e9cie atualmente invade diversas regi\u00f5es do Brasil, principalmente ao longo da costa Atl\u00e2ntica. No cap\u00edtulo 1 foi investigada a hip\u00f3tese de conservantismo de nicho (definido como a tend\u00eancia de uma esp\u00e9cie manter os requerimentos ambientais ancestrais) durante o processo de invas\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica. Tamb\u00e9m foi avaliado o potencial de invas\u00e3o de F. foet\u00edda em novos s\u00edtios no Brasil com vistas a orientar os esfor\u00e7os de controle e erradica\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica. Para a an\u00e1lise de modelagem de nicho, dois modelos rec\u00edprocos foram constru\u00eddos: um usando registros e dados ambientais da \u00e1rea nativa (temperatura, pluviosidade e topografia) para prever a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea invadida, e um usando registros na \u00e1rea invadida para prever a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o nativa. Foi verificado que a esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica expandiu o seu nicho realizado no Brasil, ocupando uma parte do seu nicho fundamental n\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel na \u00e1rea nativa. O primeiro modelo fOrward-ENM) previu \u00e1reas de risco de invas\u00e3o no Cerrado e regi\u00e3o mais interna da Mata Atl\u00e2ntica. Este\nmodelo falhou em prever a ocorr\u00eancia atual da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica no sul do pa\u00eds. J\u00e1 o segundo modelo, calibrado com dados da \u00e1rea invadida (reverse-ENM) apoiou a hip\u00f3tese de que F. foetida \u00e9 origin\u00e1ria da bacia do rio Orinoco, bacia amaz\u00f4nica e ilhas do Caribe. O teste de similaridade de nicho sugeriu que as diferen\u00e7as de nicho s\u00e3o devidas \u00e0s diferen\u00e7as na disponibilidade de habitat entre as \u00e1reas nativas e invadidas e n\u00e3o devido a mudan\u00e7as evolutivas. Sugerimos que a pr\u00e9-adapta\u00e7\u00e3o fisiol\u00f3gica (especialmente o metabolismo \u00e1cido crassul\u00e1ceo), a press\u00e3o de prop\u00e1gulos pelo hist\u00f3rico de uso e a alta capacidade competitiva s\u00e3o os principais fatores determinantes da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial atual de F. foetida no Brasil. No cap\u00edtulo 2 n\u00f3s utilizamos o marcador molecular ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats) para investigar se popula\u00e7\u00f5es clonais de F. foetida na \u00e1rea nativa (Guiana Francesa) e invadida (Brasil) diferem quanto ao n\u00edvel de diversidade e estrutura gen\u00e9tica. N\u00f3s verificamos que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es na \u00e1rea invadida apresentam n\u00edveis similares de diversidade gen\u00e9tica com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s popula\u00e7\u00f5es da Guiana Francesa na \u00e1rea nativa e tamb\u00e9m que a varia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica foi mais explicada pelas diverg\u00eancias entre indiv\u00edduos dentro das popula\u00e7\u00f5es. O baixo percentual de varia\u00e7\u00e3o explicando a diverg\u00eancia gen\u00e9tica entre regi\u00f5es e entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es, e a aus\u00eancia de correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre a dist\u00e2ncia gen\u00e9tica e geogr\u00e1fica, sugerem que m\u00faltiplas introdu\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da costa atl\u00e2ntica brasileira t\u00eam desempenhado um papel fundamental na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da diversidade. Sugerimos tamb\u00e9m que a invasividade de F. foetida est\u00e1 mais relacionada \u00e0 fixa\u00e7\u00e3o de gen\u00f3tipos pr\u00e9-adaptados atrav\u00e9s da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o clonal do que \u00e0 alta diversidade gen\u00e9tica. Recomendamos que pesquisas futuras incluam popula\u00e7\u00f5es de outras regi\u00f5es na escala nativa, al\u00e9m de diferentes tipos de habitats para a melhor compreens\u00e3o da estrutura gen\u00e9tica geral da esp\u00e9cie. No cap\u00edtulo 3, n\u00f3s realizamos um experimento com c\u00e2maras de topo aberto (open top chamber - OTC) para avaliar se o aquecimento da temperatura do ar pode favorecer ou prejudicar o desenvolvimento de bulbilhos de F. foetida com base em caracter\u00edsticas funcionais (n\u00famero de folhas, comprimento foliar, massa seca total, \u00e1rea foliar espec\u00edfica, conte\u00fado de massa seca foliar e efici\u00eancia fotossint\u00e9tica do fotossistema II). Adicionalmente n\u00f3s avaliamos se o sombreamento decorrente da cobertura vegetal \u00e9 um fator cr\u00edtico para o estabelecimento da esp\u00e9cie no ecossistema de cost\u00e3o rochoso. As OTCs aumentaram a temperatura m\u00e9dia di\u00e1ria do ar em 0.4\u00b0C em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 temperatura ambiente, resultando em um aumento significativamente maior no crescimento foliar dos bulbilhos. Em locais com cobertura vegetal elevada, houve aumento significativo da\nefici\u00eancia fotossint\u00e9tica (Fv/Fm) e redu\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado de mat\u00e9ria seca foliar (LDMC), indicando um processo de facilita\u00e7\u00e3o para o estabelecimento da esp\u00e9cie. Esses resultados evidenciam o potencial de invas\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie em novas \u00e1reas do pa\u00eds, a ocorr\u00eancia de mistura gen\u00e9tica entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es e um favorecimento ao estabelecimento inicial diante do aumento da temperatura atmosf\u00e9rica decorrente das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas. Recomendamos incluir F. foet\u00edda em programas de monitoramento de invas\u00e3o de plantas, especialmente em \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias para conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Orientamos ainda que medidas preventivas sejam tomadas para reduzir a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o e o fluxo entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es.\nPalavras-chave: Esp\u00e9cie invasora clonal.

Aquecimento global.\nABSTRACT\nInvasive alien species along with climate change, land-use and changes in nitrogen and carbon cycles, are identified as the four main drivers of global biodiversity loss. In this scenario, ecological niche modeling (ENM) studies have been increasingly used to understand the biological invasion processes as an important predictive tool to guide management actions and to compile black list of species with high risk of invasion. Detailed information on the introduction process, colonization and propagation of invasive species can be accessed through studies of the composition and genetic structure of the populations, encompassing the native and invaded area. In clonal plants, the knowledge about the genetic diversity role for the establishment and expansion of the living area of invasive species is still incipient, increasing the relevance of these studies. Moreover, the importance of studies that evaluate the functional responses of exotic species to climate change is growing. It has the potential to anticipate the effects of new climatic conditions on the dynamics of invasion. In this context, the main goal of this thesis was to understand the process of invasion of the exotic species Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) in Brazil to investigate the current potential of its expansion and understand how the atmospheric temperature increase could affect its invasion potential. Furcraea foetida is native to Central America and north of South America. This specie currently invades several regions of Brazil, mainly along the Atlantic coast. In Chapter 1 we investigated the hypothesis of niche conservatism (defined as the tendency of a species to maintain ancestral environmental requirements) during the process of biological invasion. We also evaluated the potential for invasion of F. foetida in new sites in Brazil in order to guide control efforts and eradication of exotic species. For niche modeling analysis, two reciprocal models were constructed. The first one used records and environmental data from the native area (temperature, rainfall and topography) to predict distribution in the invaded area. The second used records in the invaded area to predict the native distribution. It was verified that the exotic species expanded its niche in Brazil, occupying a part of this fundamental niche, not available in their native area. The first model forward-ENM) predicted invasion risk areas in the Cerrado and the innermost region of the Atlantic Forest. This model failed to predict the current occurrence of the exotic species in the south of Brazil. The second model, calibrated with data from the invaded area (reverse-ENM), supported the hypothesis that F. foetida originated from the Orinoco basin, the\nAmazon basin and the Caribbean islands. The niche similarity test suggested that the niche differences are due to variances in habitat availability between native and invaded areas and not due to evolutionary changes. We suggest that the physiological pre-adaptation (especially crassulacean acid metabolism), the pressure of propagules by the use of history and high competitiveness are the main factors determining the current spatial distribution of F. foetida in Brazil. In Chapter 2 we used the inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) molecular marker to investigate whether clonal populations of F. foetida in the native (French Guiana) and invaded (Brazil) area differ in the level of diversity and genetic structure. We also evaluated if there is a relationship between these results and the species invasion success in coastal areas. We found that populations in the invaded area show similar levels of genetic diversity in relation to native populations and also that genetic variation was more explained by divergences among individuals within populations. Adding to this the low percentage of variation explaining genetic divergence between regions and between populations, and the lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distance, we suggest that multiple introductions along the Brazilian Atlantic coast have played a fundamental role in maintaining the diversity. We also suggest that the invasiveness of F. foetida is more related to the fixation of pre-adapted genotypes through clonal reproduction than to high genetic diversity. We recommend that future researches include populations of other regions in the native range, as well as different types of habitats for a better understanding of the general genetic structure of the species. In Chapter 3, we performed an experiment with open-top chambers (open top chamber - OTC) to assess whether the heating air temperature may favor or hinder the development of F. foetida bulbils based on functional traits (number of leaves, leaf length, dry mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II). Additionally, we tested if the shading is a critical factor for the species establishment in a rocky shore ecosystem. OTCs increased the mean daily air temperature by 0.4 \u00b0C relative to ambient temperature, resulting in a significantly greater increase in leaf growth of bulbils. In areas with high vegetation cover, there was a significant increase of photosynthetic performance (Fv/Fm) and reduction of leaf dry matter content (LDMC), indicating a process of facilitation for the establishment of the species. These results show a broad potential for invasion of the species in new areas of the country, the occurrence of a genetic mix among populations and a favor to the initial establishment related to the atmosphere warming due to\nclimate change. We recommend including F. foetida in plant invasion monitoring programs, especially in priority areas for conservation. We also recommend that preventive measures be taken to reduce introduction and flow among populations.\nKeywords: Invasive clonal species. Ecological niche modeling. Clonal genetic diversity.

A maioria das esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o sobrevive ao trajeto ou, devido \u00e0s restri\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas, morre pouco tempo depois de ser introduzida em uma nova regi\u00e3o. Aquelas que sobrevivem e geram descendentes, n\u00e3o mais necessitando de introdu\u00e7\u00f5es repetidas para que possam persistir se tornam naturalizadas (ou estabelecidas) no ambiente, mas n\u00e3o necessariamente s\u00e3o capazes de se propagar (Zenni e Nunez 2013). Ent\u00e3o, uma pequena porcentagem das esp\u00e9cies introduzidas se torna invasora (Rejmanek et al. 2013). Isto ocorre quando a esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica \u00e9 capaz de produzir descendentes reprodutivos com frequ\u00eancia em grande n\u00famero e de dispers\u00e1-los para longe do local de introdu\u00e7\u00e3o, gerando novos focos populacionais, com impactos econ\u00f4micos e ambientais (Richardson et al. 2000; Rejmanek 2011). Esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas invasoras, juntamente com as altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, a mudan\u00e7a do uso da terra e as mudan\u00e7as nos ciclos de nitrog\u00eanio e carbono, s\u00e3o identificadas como os principais fatores de perda de biodiversidade global (Master e Norgrove 2010). As plantas est\u00e3o entre os organismos mais difundidos globalmente, uma vez que s\u00e3o extensivamente introduzidas para fins agr\u00edcolas, agroflorestais, controle de eros\u00e3o e cultivo como ornamentais (Pysek et al. 2012). Ap\u00f3s a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o, o progresso para a invas\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica envolver\u00e1 a intera\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00faltiplos fatores, tais como fatores abi\u00f3ticos, caracter\u00edsticas da comunidade receptora, atributos biol\u00f3gicos da esp\u00e9cie introduzida (Fridley 2011; Rejmanek 2011), da press\u00e3o de prop\u00e1gulos (isto \u00e9, n\u00famero de prop\u00e1gulos e frequ\u00eancia de introdu\u00e7\u00e3o) (Simberloff 2009) e da composi\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica dos prop\u00e1gulos introduzidos (Dlugosch et al. 2015). \u00c0 medida que as invas\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas nas \u00e1reas naturais avan\u00e7am, os esfor\u00e7os de controle e erradica\u00e7\u00e3o se tornam mais complexos e ineficientes, enquanto o custo aumenta (Simberloff et al. 2013). Por esta raz\u00e3o, prevenir a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o e controlar o crescimento populacional ainda na fase de estabelecimento \u00e9 a estrat\u00e9gia mais segura e eficiente em termos econ\u00f4micos para reduzir problemas futuros (Pluess et al. 2012). Com o aumento da globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que as ocorr\u00eancias de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas invasoras aumentem. A fim de reduzir as press\u00f5es diretas sobre a biodiversidade, as medidas para prevenir a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o e o estabelecimento de esp\u00e9cies invasoras s\u00e3o enfatizadas na Meta de Aichi n\u00famero 9, componente do Plano\nEstrat\u00e9gico para 2020 da Conven\u00e7\u00e3o sobre Diversidade Biol\u00f3gica (COP, CBD 2010). Neste contexto, a presente tese teve como objetivo principal explorar o potencial de estabelecimento e invas\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica e invasora Furcraea foetida L. Haw. (Asparagaceae).\nFurcraea foetida \u00e9 uma planta origin\u00e1ria da Am\u00e9rica Central e norte da Am\u00e9rica do Sul (Garc\u00eda-Mendoza 2001). Os dados na literatura sugerem que esta esp\u00e9cie tenha surgido na Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1, na bacia do Orinoco, na bacia amaz\u00f4nica ou nas ilhas do Caribe, mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 informa\u00e7\u00f5es precisas (Garc\u00eda-Mendoza, 2001). Por ser usada h\u00e1 muito tempo como fonte de fibra para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de corda e como planta medicinal, F. foetida foi introduzida em diferentes partes do continente Americano desde a \u00e9poca pr\u00e9-hisp\u00e2nica, especialmente durante as migra\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00edndios Arawak, Caribes e Patamonas (Garc\u00eda-Mendoza 2001). Folhas jovens maceradas tamb\u00e9m eram usadas como sab\u00e3o e xampu por \u00edndios Patamonas das Guianas (DeFilipps et al. 2004). Nos s\u00e9culos XVIII e XIX, esta esp\u00e9cie foi levada para a Europa para uso como planta ornamental (de Zayas 1989; Garc\u00eda-Mendoza 2001). Hoje em dia, h\u00e1 registros de invas\u00e3o na Austr\u00e1lia, Nova Zel\u00e2ndia, Maur\u00edcio, Estados Unidos (Hava\u00ed), \u00c1frica do Sul, Fiji e Chile (Meyer 2000; Macdonald et al. 2003). Na \u00c1frica do Sul, F. foetida foi classificada entre as 18 piores plantas invasoras devido ao seu impacto na estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o do ecossistema, particularmente em \u00e1reas secas (Macdonald et al. 2003). No Brasil, os registros mais antigos datam do s\u00e9culo XVII, quando foi cultivada para obten\u00e7\u00e3o de fibra (Garc\u00eda-Mendoza 2001). Atualmente a esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 principalmente usada como planta ornamental, fixadora de dunas e para cercas vivas (Sarmento et al. 2013; Pirani e Lopes 2015). \u00c9 considerada invasora nos estados de Pernambuco, no nordeste, e Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina e Paran\u00e1, no sul (I3N Brasil 2016). Os impactos negativos s\u00e3o principalmente atribu\u00eddos \u00e0 reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o clonal como forma\u00e7\u00e3o de densos agrupamentos de prop\u00e1gulos ao redor da planta m\u00e3e (Crouch e Smith 2011). Como as plantas atingem grande porte, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es podem alterar a estrutura do habitat e levar \u00e0 extin\u00e7\u00e3o local de esp\u00e9cies nativas (I3N Brasil 2016).\nEsta tese \u00e9 composta por tr\u00eas cap\u00edtulos. O primeiro cap\u00edtulo consiste em um estudo de modelagem de nicho ecol\u00f3gico com base em dados clim\u00e1ticos e topogr\u00e1ficos da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o nativa e invadida por F. foetida, o que permitiu avaliar o risco de invas\u00e3o em todo o Brasil e identificar poss\u00edveis regi\u00f5es de origem em sua \u00e1rea nativa; o segundo cap\u00edtulo envolve um estudo da composi\u00e7\u00e3o e estrutura gen\u00e9tica de popula\u00e7\u00f5es para entender os fatores que determinam a invasividade desta esp\u00e9cie clonal, e o terceiro cap\u00edtulo trata de um estudo\nexperimental para avaliar a sobreviv\u00eancia e o estabelecimento de bulbilhos em um cen\u00e1rio de aquecimento global.\nUSO DA MODELAGEM DE NICHO PARA PREVIS\u00c3O DE INVAS\u00c3O BIOL\u00d3GICA\nA modelagem de nicho ecol\u00f3gico (ENM) tem sido cada vez mais utilizada para prever o risco de invas\u00e3o por esp\u00e9cies de animais e plantas (Callen e Miller 2015; Kumar et al. 2015). Nestes estudos, o espa\u00e7o ecol\u00f3gico de ocorr\u00eancia da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 definido por um conjunto de condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais que limitam a sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o no espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico (Pearson 2007). Enquanto que o nicho fundamental descreve a gama de condi\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas que uma esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 capaz de manter uma taxa de crescimento populacional positiva, o nicho realizado descreve as condi\u00e7\u00f5es que uma esp\u00e9cie persiste submetida a intera\u00e7\u00f5es bi\u00f3ticas (Wiens and Graham 2005; Pearman et al. 2008).\nCom base na hip\u00f3tese do conservantismo de nicho, definida como a tend\u00eancia de uma esp\u00e9cie de reter os requisitos ambientais ancestrais (Wiens et al. 2010), esses modelos assumem que as esp\u00e9cies s\u00f3 poder\u00e3o colonizar os habitats semelhantes \u00e0s suas \u00e1reas nativas (Petitpierre et al. 2012). No entanto, estudos recentes demonstraram que esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas t\u00eam uma ampla capacidade de ocupar \u00e1reas clim\u00e1ticas diferentes da escala nativa, desde que respeitados seus limites fisiol\u00f3gicos (Gallagher et al. 2010; Beaumont et al. 2014).\nH\u00e1 duas raz\u00f5es principais porque o conservantismo de nicho durante a invas\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica necessita de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. Em primeiro lugar, o conservantismo de nicho \u00e9 um pressuposto necess\u00e1rio para prever o risco de invas\u00e3o em regi\u00f5es espec\u00edficas, sendo eficiente tanto para detectar \u00e1reas de alto risco, ou seja, onde a probabilidade de estabelecimento da esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 maior (visto que pode n\u00e3o prever a extens\u00e3o total da invas\u00e3o; Broennimann et al. 2007), quanto para inferir sobre regi\u00f5es de origem na \u00e1rea nativa. Neste \u00faltimo caso, um modelo de nicho rec\u00edproco deve ser constru\u00eddo com base nos registros de ocorr\u00eancia e dados ambientais da \u00e1rea invadida e projetado para a \u00e1rea de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o natural da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica, servindo como uma ferramenta auxiliar para reconstruir o hist\u00f3rico de invas\u00e3o (detectar fontes de introdu\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea nativa) (Steiner et al. 2008). Em segundo lugar, a detec\u00e7\u00e3o de desvios significativos do conservantismo de nicho pode evidenciar altera\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas ou evolutivas durante o processo de invas\u00e3o, sugerindo a capacidade da esp\u00e9cie invadir novas regi\u00f5es (Guisan et al. 2014). Para aumentar a confiabilidade destes modelos\nconstru\u00eddos no espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico das ocorr\u00eancias da esp\u00e9cie estudada, recomenda-se a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma an\u00e1lise complementar de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de nicho no espa\u00e7o ambiental de ambas as \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas (Broennimann et al. 2012).\nGEN\u00c9TICA DE POPULA\u00c7\u00d5ES INVASORAS\nA diversidade gen\u00e9tica se refere \u00e0 quantidade total de varia\u00e7\u00e3o heredit\u00e1ria acumulada ao longo do processo evolutivo de uma esp\u00e9cie, que \u00e9 gerada atrav\u00e9s de recombina\u00e7\u00e3o e muta\u00e7\u00e3o (Hartl e Clark 2010). Chamamos de diversidade intraespec\u00edfica, ou polimorfismo, a varia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica, em termos de frequ\u00eancia al\u00e9lica, que ocorre entre indiv\u00edduos de uma mesma esp\u00e9cie. A maneira como esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica est\u00e1 particionada dentro e entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es determina o n\u00edvel de estrutura, ou subdivis\u00e3o populacional da esp\u00e9cie (Hartl e Clark 2010).\nO estudo da diversidade e estrutura gen\u00e9tica de popula\u00e7\u00f5es fornece importantes insights para investigar o sucesso de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas e invasoras, sendo uma ferramenta importante para aumentar o conhecimento sobre origem geogr\u00e1fica, o processo de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o, estabelecimento, propaga\u00e7\u00e3o subsequente e o potencial para adapta\u00e7\u00e3o em diferentes ambientes (Sakai et al. 2001). Estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es podem servir de subs\u00eddio para an\u00e1lises de risco de invas\u00e3o e auxiliar o desenvolvimento de estrat\u00e9gias de manejo e controle de esp\u00e9cies invasoras (Saltonstall 2011).\nEm geral, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es introduzidas s\u00e3o fundadas intencional ou acidentalmente pelo ser humano, a partir de um n\u00famero reduzido de indiv\u00edduos representantes de uma parcela da popula\u00e7\u00e3o original. Assim, espera-se que haja altera\u00e7\u00e3o ou redu\u00e7\u00e3o nos n\u00edveis de diversidade gen\u00e9tica originais, o que tende a reduzir a viabilidade populacional e o potencial evolutivo (Saltonstall 2011). A perda de diversidade gen\u00e9tica em popula\u00e7\u00f5es rec\u00e9m-estabelecidas pode ocorrer devido ao efeito de deriva gen\u00e9tica (mudan\u00e7as ao acaso na diversidade gen\u00e9tica populacional ao longo do tempo), efeito de fundador (um caso especial de deriva gen\u00e9tica, no qual a perda da diversidade gen\u00e9tica ocorre em popula\u00e7\u00f5es formadas a partir de uma pequena fra\u00e7\u00e3o da popula\u00e7\u00e3o original) (Dlugosch e Parker 2008; Uller e Leimu 2011) e gargalo populacional (redu\u00e7\u00e3o na frequ\u00eancia de um gene devido \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida no tamanho populacional por v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es) (Rosenthal et al. 2008; Simberloff e Rejmanek 2011).\nNo entanto, a diversidade gen\u00e9tica pode ser mantida em um n\u00edvel similar ou at\u00e9 mesmo maior relativo \u00e0s popula\u00e7\u00f5es fonte na \u00e1rea nativa se as popula\u00e7\u00f5es introduzidas forem formadas a partir de\nm\u00faltiplas origens e se houver hibridiza\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou muta\u00e7\u00f5es ap\u00f3s a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o (Rosenthal et al. 2008; Gaudeul et al. 2011; Kelager et al. 2013). Embora a alta diversidade gen\u00e9tica seja importante sob o ponto de vista evolutivo, pois permite adapta\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida ao novo ambiente, em uma recente revis\u00e3o Dlugosch et al. (2015) verificaram que a diversidade gen\u00e9tica parece raramente determinar o sucesso de invas\u00e3o. Isto porque as caracter\u00edsticas que tornam as popula\u00e7\u00f5es invasoras agressivas s\u00e3o moldadas n\u00e3o pela alta diversidade gen\u00e9tica, mas sim por gen\u00f3tipos espec\u00edficos.\nMUDAN\u00c7A CLIM\u00c1TICA E O PROCESSO DE INVAS\u00c3O BIOL\u00d3GICA\nNo per\u00edodo anterior \u00e0 Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Industrial, a quantidade de CO2 na atmosfera permaneceu est\u00e1vel por aproximadamente 10.000 anos (Dukes 2011). \u00c0 medida que as atividades humanas p\u00f3s-industriais passaram a emitir quantidades crescentes de gases de efeito-estufa (GEE) para a atmosfera, em especial o di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2), mais radia\u00e7\u00e3o infravermelha passou a ser retida, contribuindo com o aquecimento da atmosfera al\u00e9m dos n\u00edveis normais e gerando altera\u00e7\u00f5es no padr\u00e3o de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o global (Dukes 2011). Modelos de circula\u00e7\u00e3o global preveem que at\u00e9 2100 a m\u00e9dia da temperatura mundial poder\u00e1 aumentar de 1.0 a 3.7\u00b0C devido ao desmatamento, utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do solo e, especialmente, a queima de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis (Pachauri et al. 2014). Para a regi\u00e3o sudeste da Am\u00e9rica do Sul, o cen\u00e1rio mais otimista de emiss\u00f5es de GEE prev\u00ea um aumento na temperatura m\u00e9dia anual entre 0.6 a 2.0\u00b0C (Magrin et al. 2014).\nAs mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas j\u00e1 est\u00e3o apresentando consequ\u00eancias para diversos organismos incluindo as esp\u00e9cies invasoras, um componente importante da mudan\u00e7a ambiental global causada pelo ser humano (Capdevila-Arguelles e Zilletti 2008). Diversos estudos t\u00eam indicado que o aquecimento atmosf\u00e9rico ir\u00e1 gerar altera\u00e7\u00f5es importantes na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, no estabelecimento e no impacto de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas invasoras (Hellman et al. 2008; Walther et al. 2009; Bellard et al. 2013; Verlinden et al. 2014). Por exemplo, prev\u00ea-se que esp\u00e9cies invasoras que s\u00e3o atualmente restritas por temperaturas frias poder\u00e3o avan\u00e7ar para regi\u00f5es de altas latitudes e para zonas de maior eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (Hellman et al. 2008).\nAl\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 previsto tamb\u00e9m que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es que atualmente ocorrem apenas ocasionalmente podem se tornar estabelecidas (ou naturalizadas) atrav\u00e9s da amplia\u00e7\u00e3o da esta\u00e7\u00e3o de crescimento e consequente aumento do sucesso reprodutivo (Walther et\nal. 2009). Finalmente, as mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas podem ainda aumentar o potencial competitivo das esp\u00e9cies invasoras (comumente com toler\u00e2ncias ambientais mais amplas) sobre esp\u00e9cies nativas menos adaptadas \u00e0s novas condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas (Hellman et al. 2008). Neste contexto, espera-se que uma das consequ\u00eancias das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas globais ser\u00e1 o agravamento dos impactos das esp\u00e9cies invasoras sobre os ecossistemas atingidos, aumentando as chances de danos irrepar\u00e1veis \u00e0 biodiversidade e \u00e0s fun\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas (Dukes e Mooney 1999; Rejm\u00e1nek et al. 2013).\nPor\u00e9m, estudos com uma abordagem experimental t\u00eam mostrado que essas altera\u00e7\u00f5es ter\u00e3o consequ\u00eancias contexto-espec\u00edficas, com efeitos que podem ser prejudiciais (Williams et al. 2007; He et al. 2012; Verlinden et al. 2014) ou ben\u00e9ficos para a esp\u00e9cie invasora (Wang et al. 2011; Chuine et al. 2012), dependendo da esp\u00e9cie em quest\u00e3o e da composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade invadida. Em um estudo realizado em uma comunidade de pastagem na Austr\u00e1lia, por exemplo, foi observado que um aumento em +2\u00b0C na temperatura do ar pode prejudicar as invasoras Hypochaeris radicata e Leontodon taraxacoides (Williams et al. 2007). Os autores verificaram que o aquecimento causou um decl\u00ednio populacional destas esp\u00e9cies atrav\u00e9s da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da germina\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes e estabelecimento das pl\u00e2ntulas. Em contrapartida, o aquecimento clim\u00e1tico pode aumentar a invasividade da liana Ipomoea cairica no sul da China, promovendo o incremento em biomassa e crescimento do caule destas plantas (Wang et al. 2011). Outro estudo realizado no oeste da Europa observou que a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura pode alterar rela\u00e7\u00f5es de domin\u00e2ncia entre esp\u00e9cies nativas e invasoras que co-ocorrem produzindo efeitos distintos em casos espec\u00edficos, como o aumento da domin\u00e2ncia da invasora Senecio inaequidens e de Epilobium hirsutum, sobre a nativa Plantago lanceolata e invasora Solidago gigantea, respectivamente (Verlinden et al. 2014).\nUma variedade de manipula\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais tem utilizado sistemas ativos de aquecimento, ou seja, com controle do fluxo de energia (como por exemplo, estufas climatizadas ou l\u00e2mpadas de infravermelho) para simular as previs\u00f5es de mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas e seus efeitos sobre esp\u00e9cies de plantas invasoras (Williams et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2011; Verlinden et al. 2014). Geralmente, esses experimentos necessitam de mecanismos adicionais de corre\u00e7\u00e3o de efeitos indesejados como sistemas de arrefecimento e umidifica\u00e7\u00e3o (Kimball et al. 2005; Verlinden et al. 2014). Tais efeitos t\u00eam sido minimizados, ou mesmo superados, com o uso de c\u00e2maras de topo aberto (OTCs), um dispositivo simples e de baixo custo que foi desenvolvido pela The International\nTundra Experiment (ITEX) para passivamente (ou seja, atrav\u00e9s do aprisionamento da energia solar) gerar um ambiente aquecido artificialmente (Marion et al. 1997; Hollister e Webber 2000). A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o destas OTCs foi validada por Hollister e Webber (2000) e t\u00eam sido amplamente utilizadas em estudos com esp\u00e9cies nativas de regi\u00f5es de alta latitude e eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (Klanderud 2005; Yin et al. 2008; De Frenne et al. 2010; Cavieres and Sierra-Almeida 2012). Por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 relatos de experimentos usando OTCs em regi\u00f5es subtropicais (onde a previs\u00e3o mais otimista prev\u00ea um aumento de at\u00e9 +2\u00b0C na temperatura m\u00e9dia anual; Magrin et al. 2014), muito menos para avaliar o efeito do aquecimento sobre as plantas invasoras.\nOBJETIVO GERAL\nO objetivo deste trabalho foi entender o processo e o risco atual de expans\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica Furcraea foet\u00edda no Brasil, assim como avaliar se os efeitos das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas afetar\u00e3o seu potencial de invas\u00e3o.\nOBJETIVOS ESPEC\u00cdFICOS\n1.\tModelar o nicho ecol\u00f3gico de F. foet\u00edda na \u00e1rea nativa e \u00e1reas invadidas no Brasil para investigar a hip\u00f3tese do conservantismo de nicho durante o processo de invas\u00e3o e os fatores ambientais que limitam a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dessa esp\u00e9cie, com vistas a determinar o potencial de invas\u00e3o de novos s\u00edtios no pa\u00eds e orientar os esfor\u00e7os de controle e erradica\u00e7\u00e3o;\n2.\tInvestigar a diversidade gen\u00e9tica e a estrutura das popula\u00e7\u00f5es na \u00e1rea nativa e invadida para compreender os fatores envolvidos na invasividade, no processo de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica de F. foet\u00edda invasora em zonas costeiras;\n3.\tAvaliar a resposta dos prop\u00e1gulos (bulbilhos) ao aquecimento da temperatura do ar sob diferentes n\u00edveis de sombreamento de forma a prever os efeitos das poss\u00edveis novas condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas sobre o estabelecimento e dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o desta esp\u00e9cie invasora.\nRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas\nBEAUMONT, L.

The species was introduced into Brazil and is now considered invasive, particularly in coastal ecosystems. To date, nothing is known about the environmental factors that constrain its distribution and there is only inconclusive information about its location of origin. We used reciprocal distribution models (RDM) to assess invasion risk of F. foetida across Brazil and to identify possible source regions in its native range. We also tested the niche conservatism hypothesis for this species using Principal Components Analyses and statistical tests of niche equivalency and similarity between its native and invaded ranges. For RDM analysis, we built two models using maximum entropy, one using records in the native range to predict the invaded distribution (forward-Ecological Niche Model or forward-ENM) and one using records in the invaded range to predict the native distribution (reverse-ENM). Forward-ENM indicated invasion risk in the Cerrado region and the innermost region of the Atlantic Forest, however failed to predict the current occurrence in southern Brazil. Reverse-ENM supported an existing hypothesis that F. foetida originated in the Orinoco river basin, Amazon basin and Caribbean islands. Prediction errors in the RDM and multivariate analysis indicated that the species expanded its realised niche in Brazil. The niche similarity test further suggested that the niche differences are because of differences in habitat availability between the two ranges, not because of evolutionary changes. We hypothesize that physiological pre-adaptation (especially, the crassulacean acid metabolism), human-driven propagule pressure and high competitive ability are the main factors determining the current spatial distribution of the species in Brazil. Our study highlights the need to include F. foetida in plant invasion monitoring programs, especially in priority conservation areas where the species has still not been introduced.\nKeywords: ecological niche models; reciprocal distribution models; niche conservatism; invasion risk; clonal plant\n1 Artigo aceito para publica\u00e7\u00e3o na revista Austral Ecology em novembro de 2016 - DOI 10.111/aec.12483.

Giehl, Fabricio Villalobos, Rafael Loyola, Geiziane Tessarolo, Nath\u00e1lia Machado, T\u00e2nia Tarabini Castellani\nIntroduction\nSome non-native species do not survive the journey to new habitats or die shortly after being introduced (Zenni &amp; Nunez 2013). Those species that reproduce (usually releasing propagules close to the parent plant) and are able to persist in the environment without direct human intervention, become naturalized, but are not necessarily invasive (Richardson et al. 2000). The biological invasion stage is reached when naturalized plants increase population size and colonise new areas in the exotic range, potentially causing damage to biodiversity and ecological functions in the invaded areas (Richardson et al. 2000; Rejmanek et al. 2013). As biological invasions advance across natural areas, eradication, containment and control efforts become more complex and inefficient and their cost increases (Simberloff et al. 2013).\nMeasures to prevent the introduction and establishment of invasive species are emphasised in Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD/COP-10), and thus research to subsidise efficient strategies, especially focusing on early invasion stages, is required. In this context, ecological niche modelling (ENM) has been increasingly used to predict invasion risk of animals (Palaoro et al. 2013; Riul et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2015) and plants (Bradley 2013; Beaumont et al. 2014; Callen and Miller 2015) in target regions. ENM can be used as a predictive tool for the compilation of \u201cblack lists\u201d of species with high invasion risk (Di Febbraro et al. 2013) or it can be used to guide management actions while taking into account potential niche shifts or geographical redistribution following climate change, e.g. as has been done in the Australian weed risk assessment system (Beaumont et al. 2014).\nAn ENM is calibrated with native occurrence records and environmental data to characterise a species' realised niche, which is a subset of its fundamental niche (Peterson 2011). A species' fundamental niche includes the entire set of conditions in which the species is physiologically able to survive and reproduce, whereas the realised niche is the subset of those conditions in which the species actually occurs as the result of constraints such as biotic interactions and dispersal limitation (Hutchinson 1957). Based on the niche conservatism hypothesis, defined as a species' tendency to retain ancestral environmental requirements (Wiens et al. 2010), an ENM would predict highest invasion risk of a species in those regions most similar to its native range in terms of climate and/or other environmental factors (Peterson 2003). Nevertheless, because some species are able to occupy different environments than those present in their native ranges, simple\nclimate matching may give inaccurate results, as has been reported for species of plants (Broennimann et al. 2007; Gallagher et al. 2010; Beaumont et al. 2014), insects (Fitzpatrick et al. 2007; Medley 2010), amphibians and reptiles (Tingley et al. 2014; Rodrigues et al. 2016). When shifts in a species' niche are observed during the invasion process, these shifts may be the result of adaptive evolution of environmental tolerances (genetic alterations), or differences in biotic constraints (e.g. absence of natural enemies), dispersal barriers or available habitats (Guisan et al. 2014). ENMs calibrated with occurrences from invaded ranges have been considered as a complementary approach for investigating invasive species, both to test the niche conservatism hypothesis and to identify the likeliest source of invasive populations in their native range (Fitzpatrick et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2012). In this study we used Principal Components Analyses (PCA) and a reciprocal geographic distribution model (which uses an ENM calibrated with occurrence data from the native range as well as an ENM calibrated with data from the invaded range) to predict the distribution of Furcraea foetida (L.) Haw (Asparagaceae) in its native and invaded ranges and to test the hypothesis of niche conservatism in this species.\nFurcraea foetida is a native plant of the Tropical Americas, but there is no information about its country of origin (Garcia-Mendoza 2001). It is thought that this species first evolved in Costa Rica, Panama, the Orinoco basin, the Amazon basin or the Caribbean islands (Garcia-Mendoza 2001). Because it has long been used as a source of fibre to produce rope, F. foetida was introduced by humans throughout America in ancient times, especially during the migrations of Arawak and Carib Indians (Garcia-Mendoza 2001). In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this species was taken to Europe for use as an ornamental plant (Garcia-Mendoza 2001; de Zayas 1989). Today, there are invasion records of F. foetida in Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, the United States (Hawaii), South Africa, Fiji and Chile (Meyer 2000; Macdonald et al. 2003; Crouch and Smith 2011). In South Africa, F. foetida was ranked among the 18 worst invasive plants because of its impact on ecosystem structure and function, particularly on dry areas (Macdonald et al. 2003). In Brazil, the oldest records date from the seventeenth century, when it was cultivated for fibre (Garcia-Mendoza 2001). Since then, this economic activity has declined and F. foetida is now cultivated mainly as an ornamental plant, for sand dune fixation and for living fences (Sarmento et al. 2013; Pirani and Lopes 2015).\nThe large continental extent of Brazil - an area of 8.5 million km2 - its Atlantic coast ranging over 7,367 km and its many distinct\nclimate zones, including humid tropics in the north, a semi-arid zone in the northeast and temperate areas in the south, making it particularly appealing for studies addressing the environmental conditions that may prevent or facilitate the stablishment of an invasive species. Currently, F. foetida is considered invasive in the state of Pernambuco in the northeast and in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana in the south (I3N Brasil 2016). Within these regions, the species occupies different types of habitat, such as steppes and forests. In the Atlantic Forest, it is found in seasonal semi-deciduous forest, submontane rain forest and coastal environments (rocky shorelines, coastal dunes, sand flats and coastal islands). Furcraea foetida has strong negative impacts on native ecosystems as a result of its clonal reproduction. Each plant grows thousands of plantlets on its inflorescences, which fall to the ground, easily rooting and forming dense clusters around the mother plant (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011). Because the individual plants grow very large, the high density populations that result greatly change habitat structure and lead to species replacement (I3N Brasil 2016).\nEven though F. foetida occurs in protected areas and government policies already include the species in official Brazilian invasion lists (Le\u00e3o et al. 2011; CONSEMA 2012; IAP 2015), there are no published studies about the environmental factors that constrain this species' distribution to guide control and eradication efforts. To fill this gap, five key questions were investigated in this study: i) Is the niche of F. foetida the same in its native and exotic ranges? ii) If there were changes in the species' niche during invasion, along which environmental axes did it? iii) What are the environmental conditions that explain the current distribution of F. foetida in the native and invaded ranges? iv) Which areas are at greatest risk of invasions in Brazil? v) Where did F. foetida originate in its native range?\nMethods\nStudy species\nFurcraea foetida s common names include piteira, Mauritius hemp, green aloe, Cuban hemp, giant false agave, false agave, giant cabuya and cocuiza. It is a monocarpic plant, thus dying after flowering, and has a life span of 5-20 years. It has a basal rosette of leaves that can grow up to 4 m in diameter and over 2 m in height. It produces a woody floral stem up to 10 m tall (Pirani &amp; Cordeiro 2002) (Fig. 1A). It reproduces essentially clonally by a rare mechanism called pseudovivipary, in which vegetative propagules called bulbils are\nproduced in reproductive structures (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011) (Fig. 1B). Long-distance dispersal may be facilitated by water, especially sea water in coastal regions, and by humans (Hueck 1953; Sarmento et al. 2013).\nFig. 1 Invasive populations of Furcraea foetida in a coastal island at the extreme south of Brazil. Arrows indicate the inflorescence (A) and bulbils in the inflorescence (B).\nOccurrence data\nFurcraea foetida occurrence data were obtained from expert observations and from the following databases: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (available at http://www.gbif.org), SpeciesLink (available at http://www.splink.org.br), The Horus Institute for Environmental Conservation and Development (I3N Brasil 2016), the Reflora Virtual Herbarium (available at http://www.reflora.jbrj.gov.br/), the Venezuela National Herbarium and French Guiana's Herbier IRD. We cleaned the set of records by removing i) coordinates located in urban areas (to prevent inclusion of plants cultivated in gardens), ii) all records taken before 1950 (to avoid incongruence between occurrence records and environmental data); and iii) all records without geographic information. We obtained only a small number of occurrence data from the literature and databases, likely because of the difficulty of making herbarium specimens of the large individuals of this species. Thus, to increase the size of our data set, we additionally collected data for 26 invasive populations in the field (Fig. 2). In total, we compiled data for 58 occurrences in Brazil and 39 in the native range (Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana).\nEnvironmental variables\nOur starting environmental data set included altitude and 19 climatic variables including temperature, precipitation and derived bioclimatic variables. Altitude was included because it is an important\ndescriptor of the topographical features which may indicate microclimatic and land use variation on landscapes that constrain plant invasion (see Pauchard and Alaback 2003). All environmental variables were obtained from WorldClim version 1.4 (Hijmans et al. 2005) at the 0.08\u00b0 x 0.08\u00b0 grid resolution (~10 km2). We obtained values for all the predictor variables over the entire extent of the invaded and native ranges. We then excluded a subset of correlated variables in order to reduce dimensionality and multicollinearity, to avoid overfitting and reduced predictive power (Peterson 2011). We did this by selecting variables depending on the variation inflation factor (VIF) and then reducing the list of variables until none had VVIF > 2 (Tab. S1). The final set of variables we selected to build ENMs (hereafter referred to as the environmental variables) included: mean diurnal range (mdr/BIO2), isothermality (iso/BIO3), precipitation of the wettest month (pwm/BIO13), precipitation seasonality (ps/BIO15), precipitation of the warmest quarter (pwq/BIO18) and altitude (alt).\nReciprocal distribution model\nBecause modelling species distribution based only on native ranges likely underestimates areas suitable for invasion, we used a reciprocal distribution model (RDM, Fitzpatrick &amp; Weltzin (2005). RDMs combine a traditional environmental niche model, based on environmental layers and occurrences sampled in the native range and used to predict the invaded range (forward-ENM), with a \u201creverse\u201d model built in the invaded range to estimate the potential native range (reverse-ENM; Fitzpatrick et al. 2007). In addition, when reciprocal models incorrectly predict invaded and native distributions, this may indicate a niche shift, and this information can be used to improve management decisionmaking (Broennimann et al. 2007; Fitzpatrick et al. 2007; Beaumont et al. 2009). We did not model the species' distribution based on native and invasive records pooled together because of its occurrence in distinct climatic zones in Brazil when compared to Central America and northern South America, therefore raising potential differences in F. foetida\" s realised niche between its native and invaded ranges. When such differences exist, modelling based on pooled occurrences is inappropriate, as it results in very broad niche estimation and a poor representation of the species' actual distribution (Peterson 2011).\nWe built the RDM in MaxEnt 3.3.3 (Phillips et al. 2006). MaxEnt is one of the most robust methods for generating species distribution models with presence-only data (Elith et al. 2006) and small\nsample sizes (Hernandez et al. 2006; Pearson et al. 2007; Wisz et al. 2008). MaxEnt implements a maximum entropy algorithm that contrasts presences with pseudo-absences drawn from background locations, i.e. areas accessible by dispersal, but where presence/absence is unknown (Barve et al. 2011; Merow et al. 2013). Because F. foetida was probably recorded mostly near larger cities, we corrected for this potential sampling bias by selecting a buffer area to use as the background area for each analysis. We selected separate buffer areas for the native range and for the invaded range. We also used geographic filtering to remove duplicate records (Aiello-Lammens et al. 2015).\nEach buffer area was delimited as follows: 1) calculating a spatial distance matrix between all pairs of occurrences; 2) finding the longest distance in the minimum spanning tree of the distance matrix; 3) truncating the distance matrix by removing values larger than the distance found in step 2; 4) calculating the mean distance in the truncated distance matrix; 5) using the mean distance from step 4 (~300 km) as a radius to draw circles around each occurrence and 6) merging all circles into a single polygon (the buffer area). Next, using the buffer as a mask on the rasters of environmental variables, we selected ten thousand raster cells at random from each buffer/background area to be used as pseudo-absences (Phillips et al. 2006). The use of a buffer prevents the selection of pseudo-absences from areas too far away from known records, which would artificially inflate the model's predictive ability (Vanderwal et al. 2009). We then assumed that the area within the buffer is available for the species in terms of dispersal but is not entirely occupied by it because of abiotic and biotic constraints.\nTo perform geographical filtering (Aiello-Lammens et al. 2015), we ran two preliminary Maxent models, one in the native and another in the invaded range, to remove duplicated records, i.e. those falling in the same raster cell. We removed 19 samples in the invaded and 6 samples in the native range. During these first runs, we also split the records into 70% for model calibration (training) and 30% for model validation using a p-ROC test (details in the Model valitadion section). This meant that we ran model calibration (steps below) using 20 occurrences in the native range and 27 in the invaded range.\nFor the forward-ENM, the model calibrated in the native range (native model) was projected over the invaded range generating a prediction of the potential distribution of the species in Brazil. This potential distribution was then contrasted with the current distribution in Brazil that was predicted by the model calibrated only with records in the invaded range (invasive model). For the reverse-ENM, the invasive\nmodel was projected over the native range, generating a prediction of the potential native range. This was then contrasted with the current distribution in the native range that was predicted by the native model. The best set of environmental variables for predicting F. foetida presences in Forward-ENM and Reverse-ENM was estimated using two tests generated by MaxEnt (Phillips 2010): the relative contribution of each variable during the model training process and the gain in predictive power by the inclusion of each variable alone using the Jackknife test.\nModel validation\nWe evaluated the accuracy of the models by the true skill statistic (TSS), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and partial-area ROC curves. TSS is a measure that takes into account both omission and commission errors and is calculated as: TSS = Sensitivity + Specificity - 1, where sensitivity measures the ability to correctly predict presences and specificity measures the ability to correctly predict ausences (Allouche et al. 2006). TSS ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect predictions and values of zero or less indicate a performance no better than random (Allouche et al. 2006). AUC is a measure of a model's ability to correctly distinguish presences from pseudo-absences (Merow et al. 2013). AUC &lt;0.5 indicate that the model is not better than a random selection AUC values range from 0.5 when model performance is random, to 1, when a model has perfect predictive ability. Models with AUC > 0.9, 0.7 &lt;AUC &lt;0.9, and 0.5 &lt;AUC &lt;0.7 indicate, respectively, great, moderate and poor performance (Swets 1988). A model performs no better than a random classifier when AUC &lt;0.5.\nEvaluating the ROC has some disadvantages in ecological niche modelling applications, mainly because this method gives equal weight to errors of commission (false presence predictions) and of omission (false absence predictions) (Lobo et al. 2008). To address this problem, we checked partial-area ROC curves with test datasets as an additional validation strategy (Peterson et al. 2008). In these curves, instead of the X axis representing the number of commission errors, which can only be known with true absence data, the X axis represents the proportion of the total area in which the species is predicted to occur. In this case, an AUC-ratio can be estimated as the proportion between the observed AUC-value and its null expectation as calculated by combinatory probability or resampling (Peterson et al. 2008). When the AUC-ratio is larger than 1, it indicates that the model performs better than a random\nclassifier. We calculated partial ROC using the Partial ROC software (Barve 2008), setting the omission error rate at 5%, and assessed the statistical significance of the AUC-ratio with a Z-test.\nNiche overlap analysis in environmental space\nBecause species distribution models can be biased by a differing extent and distribution of environmental gradients between ranges (Guisan et al. 2014), we used a method proposed by Broennimann et al. (2012) to directly measure niche overlap between the native and invaded ranges in a gridded environmental space. In this method, the total environmental space of both geographic areas, obtained from a principal components analysis (PCA), is divided into cells, each representing a unique vector of environmental conditions vij occurring at one or more locations in geographical space. The method then uses kernel density functions to calculate the smoothed density of number of occurrences (oij) and of available environments (eij) along the environmental axes of the PCA. Based on the values of oij and eij, an occupancy index, zij, is estimated. The values of zij range between 0 and 1, enabling the unbiased comparison of occurrence densities between areas that do not have the same distribution of environmental conditions. For this analysis, we used all records: 39 in the native and 58 in the invaded ranges. We built two PCAs from the zij values plotted on the environmental space, representing the species niches occupied by F. foetida in its native and invaded ranges.\nWe then calculated Schoener's D index to quantify niche overlap between F. foetida s native and invaded ranges. This index is calculated based on occupation (occurrence density corrected by environmental availability) of the environmental space, which is represented by the first two axes of the PCA (Warren et al. 2008; Broennimann et al. 2012). The D index varies between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (total overlap). This metric is independent of grid resolution because it is based on kernel functions.\nFinally, we carried out two randomisation tests to assess niche equivalency and niche similarity between the native and invaded ranges (Warren et al. 2008). The niche equivalency test evaluated whether the native and invaded niches are indistinguishable. For this test, we created pseudo-replicates by pooling occurrences from the two geographical areas and then randomly dividing them into two groups while keeping the original sample sizes. For each pseudo-replicate, we calculated the D index value. We then contrasted our original observed D-value with a null distribution of 100 pseudo-replicated D-values. We rejected the\nhypothesis of niche equivalency if the probability of the observed D-value falling in the null distribution was lower than 0.05 (P &lt;0.05). The niche similarity test asked the more relaxed question of whether the environmental space occupied in one range is more similar or more different to the environmental space occupied in the other range than would be expected at random. That is, whether similarities/dissimilarities between the native and invaded niches are more likely to be explained by ecological factors or by chance (Warren et al. 2008). For this test, the species' distribution in one range was overlapped with the distribution in the other range, by randomly assigning each occurrence a new location in the other range. For each such pseudo-replicate, we calculated the D-value. This procedure was carried out 100 times in each direction (from the native to the invaded and from the invaded to the native range) to generate two new null distributions of D-values. We rejected the hypothesis of niche similarity if the probability of the observed D falling in the null distribution was lower than 0.05 in a two-tailed test (P &lt;0.05). This set of analyses was carried out using the algorithm proposed by Broennimann et al. (2012) in R version 3.0.2 (R Core Team 2014).\nResults\nReciprocal distribution model\nNative and invaded model were accurate as indicated by the TSS statistics (0.51 \u00b10.1 and 0.61 \u00b1 0.2, respectively). The native model had an AUC &lt;0.7 and the invasive model an AUC &lt;0.9, indicating poor and moderate predictive ability, respectively. However, predictive performance as measured by partial-AUC was for both models significantly better than random (Z-test; P &lt;0.0001), with values of partial AUC \u00b1 SD of 1.42 \u00b1 0.2 for the native range and 1.55 \u00b1 0.3 for the invaded range.\nThe forward-ENM (Fig. 2A and 2B) accurately predicted the occurrence of F. foetida in the northeast, southeast and southern coast of Brazil, but it failed to predict the species' occurrence in the extreme south of the country. Another discrepancy was that the native model also identified most of the Brazilian Central Highlands as highly suitable for the species, but there are few invasion records in this region. Isothermality and precipitation of wettest month contributed most to the native model following the Jackknife test (Fig. S1) and also demonstrating high contribution during model training, reaching contributions of 34.5% and 32.8%, respectively.\nThe reverse-ENM (Fig. 2C and 2D) greatly underestimated the native range of F. foet\u00edda in Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, the innermost region of the Guianas and Amap\u00e1 State (northern Brazil). The invasive model accurately predicted the native distribution only in the coastal regions of the Guianas (French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname and southeast Venezuela) and Amap\u00e1 (northern Brazil), and in the coastal islands of Venezuela. Furthermore, it predicted maximum suitability in a larger region than predicted by the native model, in areas including the northern and southern coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Caribbean islands (some Greater and Lesser Antilles, and the Bahamas), the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua, Panama, the coastal regions of Ecuador, the Orinoco River mouth and the Amazon basin. Altitude and mean diurnal range contributed most in the model of the invaded range as indicated by the Jackknife test (Fig. S1) and showing a high contribution to model training, their contributions being 40.2% and 33.9%.\nNiche overlap analysis in environmental space\nThe principal component analysis (PCA) showed a displacement of the invaded range niche centroid (the area with highest occurrence probability density in environmental space) toward higher mean diurnal temperature range (mdr), lower precipitation of the wettest month (pwm), lower precipitation seasonality (ps) and a greater volume of precipitation in the warmest quarter (pwq) as compared to the native range niche centroid (Fig. 3A-C). The native and invaded ranges showed low niche overlap (Schoener's D = 0.217; Fig. 3) and the niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected (P = 0.02; Fig. 3D). The niche similarity tests did not reject the null expectation (P > 0.05 in both directions), indicating that differences in the realised niche can be explained by differential availability of environmental conditions in the native and invaded ranges (Fig. 3E-F).\nFig. 2 Logistic output of maximum entropy niche models of Furcraea foetida^s geographic distribution using environmental data and current occurrences (black open squares).

(D-F) Observed niche overlap D between the two ranges (red bars with a diamond) and simulated niche overlaps (grey bars) on which tests of niche equivalency (D), niche similarity between invaded and native ranges (E) and niche similarity between native and invaded ranges (F) were calculated. The significance of each test is given under each histogram.\nDiscussion\nEven though Furcraea foetida retained only 20% of its native ecological niche in the invaded region, we showed that differences in the realised niche result from differences in habitat availability (i.e. environmental conditions) between the native and invaded ranges rather\nthan changes in habitat preference, which would be expected in the case of niche evolution during invasion. This latter phenomenon requires an actual change in species' preferences, placing populations away from the environmental conditions encountered in its native range. Our findings do not support directly such a change and instead show that F. foetida preferred environmental conditions are similar in both native and invaded ranges, but that conditions identical as those from the native range are lacking in the invaded range. Niche overlap analysis indicated that F. foetida expanded its realised niche in Brazil toward regions with higher temperature range (mdr) and precipitation of warmest quarter (pwq). The prediction error in the reciprocal distribution model (RDM) supported this hypothesis, indicating that in Brazil, F. foetida occupies a part of its fundamental niche that is not available in its native range. The output of the invasive model associates F. foetida with lower average temperature range and low altitude regions, given the presence of invasive populations covering up subtropical regions of Brazil, especially in coastal environments.\nThe forward-ENM partially failed to predict the current distribution of F. foetida in the invaded range, especially in the extreme south of Brazil. This can be explained because in the native range the distribution of F. foetida correlates with high isotermality and high precipitation of the wettest month, with seasonality being a result of differences in rainfall levels. Southern Brazil, in turn, has little rainfall seasonality, but substantial annual differences in temperature. The forward-ENM model predicted that F. foetida should occur in areas from which we have the oldest known records of cultivation in Brazil -in the tropical region of northeast, where there is a record from the seventeenth century, when it was cultivated by the Dutch in the states of Cear\u00e1 and Pernambuco (Garcia-Mendoza 2001), and in the southeast, where there is a record from the nineteenth century (Neuwied 1820). Other studies of introduced species using climate-based models calibrated on the native range have also accurately predicted areas of first introduction but not the total extent of invasion, e.g. studies of the invasive herbaceous plants Centaurea maculosa in North America (Broennimann et al. 2007) and Eragrostis plana in South America (Barbosa et al. 2013) and of the dengue mosquito Aedes albopictus in the US, Europe and South America (Medley 2010). The failures in these climate-based reciprocal models indicate a niche shift occurring at the genetic and/or ecological level, i.e. in the fundamental and/or realised niche of the invasive species. As in these previous studies, the failures\nof our reciprocal distribution model might indicate changes in the realised niche of F. foetida in its invaded range.\nThe ability of alien species to colonise and survive in environmental conditions within the introduced range that are not found in the native range has been demonstrated in several studies with plants (Beaumont et al. 2009; Gallagher et al. 2010; Beaumont et al. 2014). Many key factors have been mentioned as driving non-native species to expand their realised niche when introduced to a novel region (reviews in Alexander &amp; Edwards 2010; Lloret et a. 2005; Guisan et al. 2014; Gallagher et al. 2015). In the case of F. foetida, we believe that the key factors driving its successful establishment across a wide environmental gradient in Brazil are physiological pre-adaptation (particularly succulence and CAM metabolism), high competitive ability (associated with functional traits, such as clonal reproduction and large leaf size) and human-driven propagule pressure.\nThe high water use efficiency associated with succulent leaves and CAM metabolism (which allows stomata to be opened for fixing CO2 only at night) are physiological traits which allows F. foetida to thrive in a broad range of environmental conditions, from low stress conditions to high stress conditions, such as short periods of drought and salt spray (Garcia-Mendoza 2001; Francis 2009). Recent studies about bioenergy production have shown that succulent CAM species of the genera Agave and Opuntia have a strong ability to withstand climate change, with high CO2 uptake over a wide range of temperatures and higher biomass production in warmer climates (Holtum &amp; Winter 2014; Owen et al. 2015).\nOther studies have found high competitive ability of CAM plants with clonal reproduction introduced to environmental conditions distinct from those in their native ranges (e.g. Opuntia in north-eastern Spain, Gimeno &amp; Vila 2002; Agave in south-east Spain, Badano &amp; Pugnaire 2004). Badano &amp; Pugnaire (2004) found high rates of clonal reproduction and establishment in Agave in sandy soils in its invaded area, even though such soils are rare in its native range. Likewise, clonal propagation can explain the invasiveness of F. foetida, as it generates huge numbers of clonal propagules, making it very competitive against native plants (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011). Indeed, clonal reproduction is commonly mentioned as triggering invasion success, largely via increasing populations by lateral expansion and reducing or preventing the growth of surrounding native plant communities (Badano &amp; Pugnaire 2004; Lloret et al. 2005). Vegetative propagation and large leaf size were positively associated with average alien species abundances\nand succulence was important during invasion of ruderal habitats across five Mediterranean islands (Lloret et al. 2005).\nThe colonization of new areas by F. foet\u00edda is commonly assisted by humans because its bulbils lack adaptations for any natural dispersal strategy (Hueck 1953). The distribution of invasive F. foet\u00edda populations across a wide latitudinal range, skewed towards the eastern part of Brazil, seems to be strongly related to its historical use and the number and timing of introduction events (Simberloff 2009). Up until the 1940\u2019s and \u201850\u2019s, F. foet\u00edda fibres were used for a wide variety of products, including handicrafts and fishing equipment such as ropes, fishing nets, buoys and rafts (Sarmento et al. 2013). From this time on, because synthetic fibres became extensively available, these uses of the species were abandoned. This historical use and its current use in fixing mobile dunes (Pirani &amp; Lopes 2015), explain why F. foet\u00edda has invaded mostly the Atlantic Forest coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, rocky coasts and coastal islands.\nAlthough our results point to changes only in the realised niche of F. foet\u00edda, in dealing with an introduced species used for cultivation, potentially under artificial selection, and supposedly originated from other species (in this case, F. tuberosa; see Garcia-Mendoza 2001), we cannot rule out the possibility of genetic changes. Furthermore, recent studies have shown mutations in somatic cells of Agave propagules, a genus morphologically and physiologically similar to Furcraea (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003; Infante et al. 2006). Such changes taking place in the invaded range, whether because of selection or mutation, could change the species\u2019 fundamental niche (Broennimann &amp; Guisan 2008; Mukherjee et al. 2011). Nevertheless, there is no enough evidence for changes in the fundamental niche of this species and this possibility should be tested with molecular experimental approaches and ecophysiological trials (Alexander &amp; Edwards 2010). For example, through an approach involving field data, molecular analysis and growing in common garden experiments, a study showed high genetic diversity, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in introduced Wedel\u00eda tr\u00edlobata populations, a clonal invasive weed in southern China (Si et al. 2014).\nSuitable areas predicted by the reverse-ENM in the native distribution - around the Orinoco river basin, in the Amazon basin and on Caribbean islands - support the existing hypotheses about the region in which F. foet\u00edda evolved as a species (Garcia-Mendoza 2001; see also Drummond &amp; Prain, 1907). This indicates that these regions are possible sources for the introduction of F. foet\u00edda into Brazil. In addition\nto these areas, reverse-ENM also predicted suitable areas in eastern Mexico, the coastal region of Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Panama. These results from the reverse-ENM, combined with the current broad distribution and the historical use of F. foetida in Brazil, provide strong evidence that there were multiple independent human-assisted introduction events. Multiple introductions can result in high genetic variability in the introduced populations, increasing the chance that there will be individuals already adapted to survive/reproduce in the new place, on which natural and artificial selection can act (Maron et al. 2004). To conclusively evaluate our results about the origin of F. foetida, population genetic studies must be carried out, both in its native and invaded ranges (Maron et al. 2004; Mukherjee et al. 2011).\nThe forward-ENM model results indicate at risk of F. foetida invasion in the Brazilian Central Highlands, where currently there are no records of established populations. This region is covered mainly by the Cerrado, an ecoregion considered a \u2018biodiversity hotspot' (Myers et al. 2000). The forward-ENM model also predicted high invasion risk in the innermost region of the Atlantic Forest, a hotspot whose coastal areas have already been invaded. To achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Strategic Plan 2020 of the CBD, and to help reduce direct pressures on native biodiversity, we highlight the need to include F. foetida in plant invasion monitoring programs, especially for these areas under high conservation priority where the species has not yet been introduced.\nAcknowledgements\nCB would like to thank CAPES (Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior) for a doctoral scholarship and Pablo Riul, Alexandre V.

Haw. (Asparagaceae) is an invasive plant in various tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In Brazil, the species invade mainly along the Atlantic coast. The reproduction is essentially clonal, with efficient production of thousands vegetative propagules per individual. The occupation of the southern regions of the country resulted from the expansion of the ecological niche, suggesting its high invasiveness. The actual distribution seems to be related to its historical use and human-driven propagule pressure. In this study we hypothesize that the maintenance of genetic diversity of clonal populations is mainly given by multiple introductions events. We also hope that the introduction of new genotypes from different sources should increase the genetic differentiation among individuals within the same population and decrease among populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of populations in the native and invaded range to understand the factors involved in the geographic distribution in coastal environments. For this purpose we used ISSR molecular markers (inter-simple sequence repeats) to investigate: i) the level of genetic diversity of clonal populations; ii) the distribution of genetic diversity between native and invaded areas; iii) the variability and genetic structure of populations in the native and invaded area. Three populations in the native area (French Guiana) and nine in the invaded area (southeast and south of Brazil) were sampled. Invaded populations showed similar levels of genetic diversity in relation to the native populations. Genetic variation in both areas was explained due to divergences among individuals within populations than between populations and between regions. Based on the history of human use, we believe that multiple sources of introduction are the main factor in maintaining clonal diversity. We recommend that human-mediated dispersal should be prevented in order to halt the continued expansion.\nKeywords: ISSR, clonal invasive, clonal diversity, genetic structure, multiple introductions\n72\nIntroduction\nThe science of biological invasions, an important component of global change, is a growing field of studies concerned with the detection, understanding and mitigation of the health, economic and environmental impacts generated by the anthropogenic introduction of animal and plant species into ecosystems where they originally did not occur (Simberloff et al. 2013). Information on the composition and genetic structure of populations encompassing the native and invaded area can provide valuable insights into the invasion histories (since introduction, colonization, and subsequent propagation) and the reproductive system of the species concerned (Barret et al 2008; Dlugosch &amp; Parker 2008; Simberloff &amp; Rejmanek 2011; Kelager et al. 2013; Bock et al. 2015). With the accidental or intentional translocation of species globally, changes in the genetic diversity, structure and degree of differentiation may occur in newly introduced populations as a function of a genetic drift, founder effect and demographic bottlenecks (Dlugosch &amp; Parker 2008).\nIn general, naturalized populations of species that have been intentionally introduced multiple times over an extended period of time tend to accumulate more genetic diversity (especially if the extent of native area is large) than naturalized populations from single or occasional introduction (Dlugosch &amp; Parker, 2008; Keller &amp; Taylor 2010; Verhoeven et al. 2010; Bock et al. 2015). However, several researches indicate that the role of genetic diversity can vary in plants with different reproductive modes and for this reason, it will not necessarily be a determining factor for invasion success (Wang et al. 2005; Li et al. 2006; Dlugosch et al. 2015; Geng et al. 2016). In plants with clonal reproduction for example, it is expected that a proliferation of identical genotypes will increase the importance of genetic drift by decreasing the effective size of the population (Reusch et al. 2000).\nMolecular markers have been widely used to investigate whether the genetic diversity of clonal populations can determine the invasiveness of these plants, as well as if there is a relationship with the invasion history (eg geographical origin, dispersion mechanisms, and number of introductions), local adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity (Wang et al. 2005; Li et al. 2006; Kelager et al. 2013; Si et al. 2014; Geng et al. 2016). Some of these studies have observed that invasive clonal plants are able to thrive even at an extremely low or nonexistent level of genetic diversity as indicated for populations of aquatic plants Alternanthera philoxeroides (Wang et al. 2005; Geng et al. 2016) and Eichhornia crassipes (Li et al. 2006), both invasive in south of China.\nThe authors suggested that the invasiveness of these species was mainly determined by the fixation of genotypes well adapted to the new environment, by the phenotypic plasticity and by the fast vegetative propagation ability, characteristics that compensate for a low genetic diversity. But, in some cases, similar levels of genetic diversity among native and introduced populations also have been verify in clonal plants, such as Rosa rugosa (native to East Asia) in northern Europe (Kelager et al. 2013) and A. philoxeroides (native to Argentina) in the USA (Geng et al. 2016), both probably reflecting different introductions histories.\nNative to Central America and North of South America, Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) is a clonal plant that is invading Brazilian coastal ecosystems such as rocky shorelines, coastal dunes, sand flats and coastal islands, but also occur in secondary forests at 2000 meters above sea level. The oldest records of F. foetida in Brazil date back to the seventeenth century, when it was cultivated in the northeast of the country by the Dutch for the production of fibers (Garcia-Mendoza 2001). With the substitution of this resource for synthetic fibers, the species is currently cultivated mainly as an ornamental plant and as a living fence (Pirani &amp; Lopes 2015). Actually, there are records of invasion in several countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, the United States (Hawaii), Fiji and Chile (Meyer 2000), being classified among the 18 worst invasive plants in South Africa (Macdonald et al. 2003). In Brazil, F. foetida is included in the official lists of exotic and invasive species (Le\u00e3o et al. 2011; CONSEMA 2012; IAP 2015), and some management strategies have already been applied, such as mechanical eradication and spraying of herbicides (I3N-Brasil 2016).\nThe impact on the structure and function of ecosystems is mainly attributed to the high competitive ability associated to production of thousands of vegetative propagules (bulbils) and to the large size that adults reach (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011). Beside this, the gravitational dispersal (with most bulbils falling around the parent plant) form dense population groups that exclude native vegetation (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011). The production of fruits and seeds is unknown in the natural environment both in native and invaded regions (Hueck 1953; Garcia-Mendoza 2001; Pirani &amp; Cordeiro 2002), and cited as rare in South Africa, where the plant is invasive (Crouch &amp; Smith 2011). Colonization of new areas is commonly man-assisted, with no further adaptations to natural dispersion for long distances (Hueck 1953). However, water can also act as a secondary vector, since the bulbils fall\ndirectly into the sea (personal observation). The invasiveness of F. foetida should also to be relating to its wide physiological capacity (attributed mainly to succulence and CAM metabolism), and human-driven propagule pressure (Barbosa et al. 2017).\nA recent study showed that F. foetida expanded their realized niche to novel environments in Brazil, occupying a part of its fundamental niche that does not is available in the native range and suggesting the high invasive potential of the species (Barbosa et al. 2017). Althought somatic mutations have been observed in Agave propagules, a genus morphologically and physiologically similar to Furcraea (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003; Infante et al. 2006), Barbosa et al (2017) concluded that the wide latitudinal range of distribution of the species seems to be strongly related to its historical use and to the number and timing of introduction events. Then, in this study we hypothesize that the maintenance of genetic diversity of clonal populations is given by multiple introductions events. We also hope that the introduction of new genotypes from different sources should increase the genetic differentiation among individuals within the same population and decrease among populations. We use ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats) molecular markers to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of F. foetida populations in the native and invaded range to understand the factors involved in the geographic distribution in coastal environments. From this, three questions were investigated: i) the level of genetic diversity of clonal populations; ii) the distribution of genetic diversity between native and invaded areas; iii) the variability and genetic structure of populations in the native and invaded area.\nMethods Population sampling\nSamplings were conducted in two regions distributed along the East Coast of South America (Fig. 1). In the southern coast of Brazil, 76 individuals were sampled from five populations and in the southeastern, 80 individuals were sampled from four populations (Tabela 1; Fig. 1). In French Guiana we collected 66 individuals from three populations (Table 1; Fig. 1). All populations were collected in coastal ecosystems (except Roche des Abeiles in French Guiana, located approximately 100 km from the coast). Rocky soil is similar in all populations. To ensure better quality of DNA, the collection of plant tissue was always made from the youngest leaf of the rosette. Adjacent individuals were avoided in order to prevent collection of the same genet. Samples were dehydrated over silica gel and stored at -80\u00b0C.\nDNA extraction and ISSR protocol\nDNA was extracted from approximately 50 mg of leaf sample according to Doyle and Doyle (1987) protocol. PCR amplifications were performed in a total volume of 20 gL, containing 2.0 gL 10x PCR buffer, 50 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTPs, 20 gM primer, 5 units Taq polymerase (Kit Invitrogen Recombinant), H2O and DNA template. The amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1.5 min, followed by 37 cycles of 40 s at 94 \u00b0C, 45 s at 50 \u00b0C, 1.5 min at 72 \u00b0C and a final extension of 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. Amplification products were electrophoretically separated at a constant voltage of 100 V for 3 h in 1.5 % agarose gels with 0.5x TAE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. A 100 bp DNA ladder was used to indicate the molecular size of the fragments.\nTo evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of F. foetida populations, we used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), a dominant PCR-related nuclear markers associated to microsatellites that have been proved effective in discriminating different clones (Wang et al. 2005; Li et al. 2006; Geng et al. 2016). The ISSR marker has been used in similar studies of Agave (Vargas-Ponce et al. 2009; Torres-Moran et al. 2010; Aguirre-Dugua and Eguiarte 2013; Trejo et al. 2016). A total of 16 ISSR primers successfully applied in others similar studies with Furcraea and Agave species were tested for amplification reactions, from which seven were selected due to reproducibility (Table 2).\nData analyses\nFrom the molecular ISSR data analysis, the fragments amplified were visually evaluated through images of agarose gels. Smeared and weak bands were excluded. The loci identified of all individual for each primer generated a matrix of presence (1) or absence (0) of bands. From this data, the estimates of genetic diversity parameters, as total number of loci in each population (N), mean Shannon's index of phenotypic diversity (I), percentage of polymorphic loci (P), and mean expected heterozygosity (He), were computed with GenAlEx 6.5 software (Peakall and Smouse 2012).\nConsidering the multiloci phenotype as a haplotype, the binary data were converted to a matrix of Nei's genetic distance (Nei 1978) and a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) was performed to examine\nTable 1.

For population names, see Table 1.\noverall patterns of genetic similarity among genotypes and among 12 populations using GenAlEx 6.5. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed (also based on matrix of Nei's genetic distance) in Genealex 6.5 for four different hierarchical levels: (1) overall dataset (invasive + native); (2) regional subsets (invasive X native), (3) invasive populations and (4) native populations. A fifth AMOVA was performed for the groups (K = 3) indicated by Bayesian analysis. The null hypothesis (H0) for AMOVA is that subpopulations can be considered part of a single large random mating genetic population (Peakal and Mouse 2012).\nA Bayesian structure analysis for overall dataset (invasive + native) was performed using the software STRUCTURE 2.3 (Falush et al. 2007; Pritchard et al. 2010). The Bayesian analysis infers the\nclustering number of structured populations genetically homogeneous (K) and the probability for each individual to belong to respective population (or to come from an external source). Bayesian method is more appropriate for dominant markers because accounts more appropriately for the inherent ambiguity of recessive (absent) alleles, do not assume previous knowledge of the inbreeding and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and performs well even with relatively small numbers of loci and populations (Holsinger et al. 2002). The number of presumed populations (K) was set of K=1 to K=13. For each K, ten independent runs were performed with 100,000,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs for each one, with a burn-in of 100,000 iterations. We used \u2018admixture model' and \u2018alleles correlated among populations', with the other parameters set as default (Pritchard et al. 2010). To identify optimal population clustering number, we calculated the average of each K log probability value (LnP(D)), through all runs as suggested by Pritchard et al. (2000) and the statistic AK, a good predictor of the real number of clusters for dominant markers according to Evanno et al. (2005).\nTo check isolation by distance, i.e. how much of the genetic differentiation between pairs of populations can be explained by geographical distance, a Mantel test (Mantel 1967) was applied using Genealex 6.5 to assess whether there is a significant relationship between the matrix of pairwise genetic differentiation ($ST) and geographical distances (log-transformed) between overall populations with 999 random permutations.\nTable 2.

In the invaded range, ARV population had the lowest number of fragments (69) and the ANH the highest (79) (Table 3). In the native range, the number of fragments ranged from 73 (RAB) to 78 (RVE). The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 18.52% (ARV) to 62.96% (ANH) among populations in the invaded range and from 25.93% (RAB) to 50.62% (RBV) in the native range. The expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.077 (ARV) to 0.221 (ANH) in the invaded range, and from 0.136 (RAB) to 0.162 (RVE) in the native range. The same populations in the invaded range (ARV and ANH) also showed, respectively, the lowest (0.111) and highest (0.330) values for Shannon Index. In the native range again, RAB and RVE showed the lowest (0.136) and highest (0.162) Shannon Index values, respectively (Table 3). One exclusive allele was observed on ANH.\nGenetic differentiation among populations\nThe genetic differentiation was moderate among all populations ($ST = 0.112; Table 4) and was lower within the native range (0.027) than invaded range (0.120). Values were always statistically significant (P &lt;0.05). In both cases, the genetic variability among individuals within the same population explained most of the total variation, ranging from 88% to 97%. The Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCoA; Fig. 2) showed that 51.41% of the population\u2019s variation was explained by the first two axes of the multivariate space. The first principal coordinate captured 31.22% of the total variance and separated the islands ARV e GAL (both from the same archipelago of the Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve) from the others Brazilian populations (Fig. 2). The second principal coordinate explained 20.19% of the total variance. There was no ordering of discrete groups and there is some overlap in both axes, suggesting admixture of genetically distinct lineages among populations and regions.\nThe Bayesian Structure analysis confirmed PCoA results, indicating an optimal value of K = 2 distinct genetic groups (AK = 12.32) but no population presented an exclusive genetic pool (Fig. 3). The clustering in three distinct genetic pools was also indicated with similar probability (AK = 11.4), and agreed better with the multivariate analyses (Fig. 2), bringing together the Brazilian populations, except ARV and GAL. These latter populations share the same genetic pool of native populations (RAB, MON and RVE). The third clustering is composed mainly by individuals from ANH population, but many\nindividuals in all other populations have ancestry coefficients highly related to this cluster (Fig. 3). The genetic differentiation of these three groups ($ST) was 0.130 (Table 4). No correlation between genetic differentiation (measured with $ST) and geographic distances among populations was shown by the Mantel test for all populations (R2 = 0.011; P = 0.0047).\nTable 3.

Abbreviations indicate nine populations in the invaded range (NAU, CAMP, ANH, ARV, GAL, CAMB, ALC, CAL and IB) and three in the native range (RAB, MON and RVE) according to Table 1.\nDiscussion\nThis study showed that the clonal diversity in coastal invasive populations of F. foetida in most cases was similar to the native populations in French Guiana. Then, there was no negative effect in quantity of diversity associated with bottleneck events. Among the possible source of genetic variation in clonal plant populations (as gene flow recombination, mutation, and polyphyletic origins of founding individuals) (Ellstrand &amp; Roose 1987), since have no known reproductive alternative to vegetative reproduction (at least in populations sampled), the maintenance of genetic diversity in F. foetida must come from somatic mutations, but mainly from multiple origins of the founding clones.\nConsidered an important source of heritable variation for clonal plants, somatic mutations have been suggested to maintain the level of genetic diversity in several clonal plants populations (Li et al. 2004; Meloni et al. 2013; Si et al. 2014). These mutations in somatic cells should affect only one allele at each locus, leading to a gradual accumulation of heterozygous loci which in turn will be fixed in a clonal population as cannot be eliminated by sexual reproduction (Burrell et al. 2015). With a long life cycle of up to 20 years, somatic mutations in the lines of origin and throughout many mitotic generations in F. foetida may lead to some accumulation of variation in the long term. The strengthening of the hypothesis of somatic mutations in F. foetida also arises from previous studies with related species. Using amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and inverse sequence-tagged repeat (ISTR), mutations in somatic cells were verified in Agave species through the presence of genetic variation in vegetative propagules, such as in A. fourcroydes Lem. (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003; Infante et al. 2003), A. americana L., A. angustifolia Haw, A. deserti Engelm. and A. sisalana Perrine ex Engelm. (Infante et al. 2006), and A. tequilana (Torres-Mor\u00e1n et al. 2010).\nHowever, because the mutation rates are very slow and considering the dynamics of colonization, the history of multiple introductions at different times and by human action should be the main responsible for the maintenance of genetic variability in invasive populations (Ellstrand &amp; Roose 1987; Pappert et al. 2000; Gaudeul et al. 2011; Kelager et al. 2013). Formed by genetic variation of lineages not necessarily related, F. foetida populations are moderately structured ($ST = 0.112), mainly explained by the divergence among individuals within populations (89%), expected if founding individuals had diverse genetic origins (Pappert et al. 2000). This hypothesis is also suggested since the\nnative populations were more similar to each other ($ST = 0.027) than Brazilian coastal populations to each other ($ST = 0.120) suggesting the entry of propagules from other regions not covered in the present study.\nThe low percentage of variation explaining the divergence among regions (2%) and among populations (10%) also indicated high genetic interchange among coastal populations after initial introduction. The structure analysis that identified two genetic groups (K = 2) agree with this, showing that there is overlap between populations and at the same time, that there is genetic difference among individual within populations. In addition, in agreement with the AMOVA results, the structure analysis indicated that native populations belong almost exclusively to a single gene pool, with only one individual in RVE showing high probability of belonging to outside group. An alternative explanation for it could be that the frequency of some rare alleles in the native area increased during species expansion in the invaded range, or may also be originating from another non-sampled region in the native area.\nConsidering K = 3, a more subtle genetic structuring is indicated, with the three genetic groups significantly divergent from each other. This result indicated that French Guiana populations share the same clonal lineage between themselves (in red) and among ARV and GAL, which in turn separated from the other invasive populations (Fig. 2). This result supports a recent study that suggest, through reciprocal ecological niche modeling, the northern South America (mainly along the coastal regions) as the proximal origin of some introductions of F. foetida into Brazil (Barbosa et al. 2017). In addition, a third cluster (in blue) frequent in the invaded populations indicates that French Guiana populations do not encompass all of the native range of the species.\nAlthough in general no bottleneck event could be detected, lower level of genetic diversity, possibly associated to the recent colonization, number of introduction events and propagule sources (Dlugosch &amp; Parker 2008; Kelager et al. 2013) were observed in specific cases. For example, the lowest value of genetic diversity of the Arvoredo Island (ARV) can be explained due to a single recently introduction, and them, there was no time to accumulate genetic diversity through mutation (see Ellstrand &amp; Rosse 1987; Geng et al. 2016). In this island, the introduction of exotic plants possibly occurred during recent human occupation, between 1849 and 1877 (Paes 2016). In 1877, a lighthouse was built, as well as other auxiliary techniques of the Brazilian Navy, due to the increasing demand for navigation. In\n1990, the Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve (icmbio.gov.br/rebioarvoredo) was created, which encompassed ARV and other three islands, including the Gal\u00e9 island-GAL (where there are no historical occupation records). From then on, the access to the archipelago is limited and the possibility of entry of new propagules through both by human and marine dispersal seems unlikely, since this island is 15 km away from the coast.\nIn contrast, the Anhatomirim (ANH) island showed the highest value of genetic diversity, even higher than those in the native populations. This island is the closest to the coast (approximately 300m) which indicates the possibility of natural dispersal by the sea since there are several populations of F. foetida that can be sources of vegetative propagules along the coastline. In addition, because in ANH island there is a historical fortress built in the 18th century, currently there is an expressive influx of tourists. In the locality, there is a naturalized population on the east coast (where genetic material was sampled) and also other individuals planted as ornamental in the landing area on the west coast, highlighting the importance of human intervention as a source of continuous introduction for ANH island.\nHuman-mediated dispersion has been reported as the main driver for maintenance of clonal diversity in invasive populations (Li et al. 2004; Kelager et al. 2013; Burrel et al. 2015). Knowing this, the pattern of variation (high variation among individuals within populations) and genetic structure (low differentiation among populations) verified for invasive populations of F. foetida, together with the lack of correlation of genetic and geographic distances, as would be expected in the case of greater influence of the natural dispersion, suggest that the human-mediated dispersion has played a key role in maintaining of the clonal diversity along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. We also suggest that the success of F. foetida invasions could be explained more parsimoniously by the nature of genetic variation (with pre-adapted genotypes) than the total amount of genetic diversity per se (see Dlugosch et al. 2015). The succulent leaves and CAM metabolism (which allows stomata to be opened for fixing CO2 only at night) are important morphophysiological traits that allow F. foetida to thrive in a wide range of climatic conditions, resistance to salinity and its high propagative ability (Barbosa et al. 2017), can overcame the stochastic loss of genetic diversity during invasion process (Wang et al. 2005). Then, the non-need for a lag time for adaptation should facilitate a rapid colonization and expansion of F. foetida even for regions of subtropical climate as in southern Brazil. Although moderate genetic diversity and\ndivergence among native and introduced regions is revealed to populations along the Atlantic coast, future research should encompass other sources in the native range, also including different habitats such as in high-elevation, in order to understand the overall genetic structure of this clonal invasive plant.\nAcknowledgements\nCB would like to thank CAPES (Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior) for a doctoral scholarship and S\u00e9rgio Zalba, Mayara Caddah, Natalia Hanazaki, Paulo A.

These impacts can exacerbate by synergism with other global change drivers, such as biological invasions. Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) is a CAM species native to Central America and northern South America. In Brazil it is currently invading coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic Forest biome, forming dense population clusters that exclude native species. We addressed whether warming may favor or impair development of F. foetida bulbils based on functional traits, and assessed whether plant cover of native species influenced F. foetida establishment in a rocky shore ecosystem. We used open-top chambers which increased air temperature during daylight hours by 0.4\u00b0C relative to ambient. Short-term warming effects enhanced leaf length without increasing number of leaves, dry mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) or photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). However, plant cover decreased LDMC and helped maintain high Fv/Fm values, having thus an indirect positive effect on F. foetida establishment. Even though manipulated temperature did not reached IPCC forecasts for 2100, small, short-term changes in temperature had effects on plant performance. Thus, we suggest that F. foetida may be favored in an optimistic scenario of climate change, increasing its negative effects on biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.\nKeywords: CAM species, climate change, facilitation, invasions, opentop chambers, warming.\n94\nIntroduction\nClimate change, and particularly warming, has been the focus of many studies concerned with its environmental and economic impacts (Rustad 2008; Hou et al. 2014; Knutti et al. 2015). Changes of species distribution and ecosystem function and services are often consequence of global warming, which is expected to intensify by synergism with other global change drivers such as the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, changes in global trade routes, habitat fragmentation, alterations of disturbance regimes and biological invasions (Dukes &amp; Mooney 1999; Walther et al. 2009; Bradley et al. 2010). Global circulation models predict for southeast South America - in an optimistic scenario - an increase in mean annual temperature of 0.6oC-2.0\u00b0C, and of 2.2\u00b0C-7\u00b0C in the most pessimistic scenario (Magrin et al. 2014).\nRecent research has shown that an important consequence of global change is the worsening of biological invasion impacts on ecosystems, eroding biodiversity and ecological functions (Dukes and Mooney 1999; Rejmanek et al. 2013). The distribution of invasive species can be widely modified as climate becomes suitable, allowing them to successfully colonize habitats where they currently fail (Smith et al. 2012). Thus, climate change will also increase the competitive ability of some invasive species with physiological tolerances wider than native species, less adapted to new environmental conditions (Walther et al. 2009; Verlinden et al. 2014). Nevertheless, experimental manipulations have shown that warming can have site-specific consequences, with effects that can either be positive (Wang et al. 2011; Chuine et al. 2012; He et al. 2012) or negative (Williams et al. 2007) for invasive species, depending on specific traits and the native competitors (Verlinden et al. 2014). Williams et al. (2007) for example, observed warming causing population decline of two invasive weeds in Australian temperate grasslands, with negative effects on seed production, seedling emergence and establishment of Hypochaeris radicata and Leontodon taraxacoides.\nWe carried out a field experiment to assess the effect of warming on the colonization success of an invasive clonal plant species, Furcraea foetida L. (Haw.) (Asparagaceae). Native to Central and northern South America (Garcia-Mendoza 2001), F. foetida was introduced into Brazil as source of fiber but at present is mostly used as ornamental and in live fences (Barbosa 2011). The species is currently distributed along a wide latitudinal range in the eastern part of the country, invading mainly coastal systems of the Atlantic Forest biome, such as coastal dunes and rocky shores, including coastal islands\n(Barbosa et al. 2017a-b). Its invasiveness is highly associated with reproduction by thousands of bulbils per plant, which form dense cluster around the mother plant that competes with native vegetation (Barbosa et al. 2017a). Adult F. foetida plants reach large sizes (about 4 m in diameter) and high densities. These characteristics may significantly alter the structure of local plant communities (Barbosa et al. 2017a). In addition, its ability to occupy a wide climatic zone (as in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas) can be attributed to the succulence of its leaves and CAM metabolism (Barbosa et al. 2017b). Currently, it is invading countries such as Australia, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States and overseas departments of France, including the Reuni\u00f3n Island (Baret et al., 2006; Crouch and Smith 2011; Gargominy et al. 1996; Macdonald et al. 2003; Meyer 2000).\nPrevious studies with species morphologically similar to F. foetida showed that high temperatures can be a limiting factor for survival during early development stages. In desert environments, where temperatures in exposed areas at soil surface can exceed 70\u00b0C in summer, survival of Agave deserti and A. macroacantha seedlings was associated with sheltered microhabitats (Franco and Nobel 1988; Arizaga and Ezcurra 2002). In stressful habitats marginal to the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, such as coastal dune and rocky shore, exposed soils temperatures may also exceed 70\u00b0C in summer, and then, vegetation cover of native community may provide appropriate environmental conditions for germination and growth of other species (Scarano 2002). Thus, a better understanding of the response of propagules (bulbils) to warming and the effects of different levels of native vegetation cover is critical to anticipate the effects of new climate conditions on the colonization and spread of invasive species. In this framework, we tested 1) if warming may impair physiological parameters of F. foetida bulbils in the short-term; and 2) whether the native vegetation cover of the rocky shore ecosystems can facilitate establishment of F. foetida.\nMethods Field site\nThe field site was located in the northwest coast of the Campeche Island (27\u00b069'S, 48\u00b046'W) in a place invaded by F. foetida. The Campeche Island is 1.5 km apart from Santa Catarina Island and 17.5 km to the continental coast, in southern Brazil. The island has a total area of 531,200 m2 and approximately 4,480 m of coastline (Mazzer and Panitz 2006). The local climate is subtropical humid (Cfa)\nin Koppen classification. Mean annual temperature for the last ten years was 20.9\u00b0C with a mean maximum of 28.8\u00b0C in February and minimum of 10.3\u00b0C in July (Tonetta et al. 2016). Rainfall is more frequent in summer than in winter, averaging 1876 mm per year (Fuentes and Petrucio 2015).\nOpen-top chambers\nWe use open-top chambers (OTCs) as a simple, low-cost approach to passively (i.e., through the trapping of solar radiation) generate an artificially heated environment (Marion et al. 1997; Hollister and Webber 2000). The use of OTCs was popularized by the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) and it efficacy has been validated in studies involving native species of high latitude regions, particularly tundra ecosystems (Marion et al. 1997; Hollister and Webber 2000), as well as in alpine systems in Norway (Klanderud 2005), quartz fields in South Africa (Musil et al. 2005), and the Chilean Andes (Cavieres and Sierra-Almeida 2012). OTCs have been also used in temperate forest in China (Yin et al. 2008), and Belgium (De Frenne et al. 2010). OTCs were made with 1 mm-thick acrylic material with high transmittance ratio of solar radiation (approximately 90%) and low transmittance of infrared radiation (Marion et al. 1997). OTCs were cone-shaped, 40 cm high, 60 cm in basal diameter (i.e., 0.28 m2) and an open top of 25 cm in diameter.\nExperimental setup\nIn early January 2015, 17 OTCs and 17 control sites were randomly distributed in an area of 1000 m2 on a rocky shore community. In this locality, plant community is composed by herbaceous and subshrubs species adapted to strong winds and salty spray, and is dominated by the sub-shrub Varronia curassavica, and the rainforest liana Stigmaphyllon ciliatum. A shallow sand soil is developed on granitic rocks (Mazzer and Panitz 2006). All sites sampled were composed by the same soil type and wind exposure with variation only on the percentage of plant cover. Each control site was delimited by the basal area of OTCs (0.28 m2).\nAir temperature was recorded simultaneously inside and outside (20 cm apart) OTCs with iButton sensors (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) placed 10 cm aboveground. Hourly measurements were taken during the summer season in seven samples between 20 Jan-16 Feb 2015 and in the remaining 10 samples in 19 Feb-8 Mar 2015. Temperature was again recorded in the mid-autumn season (04 Nov-24\nApr 2015). During this period we measured all 17 sampling units at once. We collected 50 F. foetida bulbils directly from the inflorescence of 5 reproductive plants (3 in the Campeche island and 2 in Santa Catarina island) on 15 Jan 2015. Bulbils were thoroughly mixed and 136 bulbils were selected at random for the experiment. Four bulbils were planted in each of the 34 sample units, one in the center and three with a triangular distribution 15 cm from the central bulbil and 15 cm from the edge, totaling 68 bulbils planted within OTCs and 68 in control plots. All bulbils were harvested at the end of autumn (16 Jun 2015) after five months of growth.\nVegetation cover\nAt the end of the experiment, we estimated the percent plant cover for each sampling unit. We used a digital camera (Canon PowerShot SX160; focal length: 5-80 mm; maximum resolution 16 megapixel) positioned at ground level and with the lens facing upward in the center of each plot (inside and outside OTCs). Percent plant cover was estimated using the CPCE software (Kohler and Gill 2006) which, on each image, selected at random fifty points and each was assigned to categories \u2018cover\u2019 or \u2018no cover\u2019.\nPhysiological parameters\nTo evaluate the effects of warming and shading on F. foetida, the 128 bulbils surviving by the end of experiment were harvested, placed in plastic bags and taken to the laboratory, where we determined number of leaves, leaf length, total dry mass (DM), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). The last measurement was taken within 3 h after collection (14:00-15:00 hours).\nTo evaluate Fv/Fm, we used the youngest mature leaf of each bulbil using a portable PEA fluorometer (Plant Efficiency Analyser, Hansatech Instruments, King's Lynn, UK) after 20 min dark adaptation (Baker and Rosenqvist 2004). Parameters involving leaf mass content (SLA and LDMC) were measured on a leaf disc obtained from the same leaves used for Fv/Fm measurements with a 1.5 cm hole puncher. Leaf discs were individually weighed to obtain fresh mass and then placed in distilled water for 24 h. Then, they were carefully blotted dry and weighed again to obtain saturated mass (at full turgor). Later, leaf discs were dried at 70\u00b0C for 96 h to obtain dry mass. Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the ratio between leaf area and dry mass (Dwyer et al. 2014). Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) was calculated as the ratio\nbetween dry and saturated mass (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). Total dry mass was measured on the whole bulbil, except roots as they could not be fully extracted.\nStatistical analyses\nThe value of each physiological/functional parameter was averaged among the four bulbils in each sample. The effect of temperature (inside and outside OTCs) and the effect of plant cover on these variables, and the interaction between them, were evaluated by Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Gamma distribution and the log link function were used for number of leaves, DM, LDMC and Fv/Fm; a Gaussian distribution was assumed for leaf length and SLA, totaling seven models. All GLM analyses and figures were produced with R software (version 3.2.2) (R Core Team 2015) using the \"car\" and the \"MASS\" packages.\nResults\nOTCs increased average air temperature during the whole experiment period (20 Jan to 16 Jun 2015) by 0.4\u00b0C in our rocky shore ecosystem (Table S1). Heating was more effective during daytime (7-18 h), rising temperature 0.6\u00b0C with respect to ambient particularly in the hottest hours of the day (between 11 h and 16 h) (Table S1; Figure S1). Notably, the largest warming contribution did occur with maximum temperatures, which achieved 1.3\u00b0C above ambient inside OTCs (Table S1). OTCs heating were slightly more effective in summer than in autumn. In summer, OTCs increased mean daily temperature by 0.5\u00b0C, especially on daylight hours (0.8 \u00b0C) but particularly at peak temperature (1.8\u00b0C).\nMean vegetation cover was 68.3 \u00b1 4.1% in sites with OTCs and 65.2 \u00b1 6.2% in control sites. The range of variation was 30-90% in OTC sites and 18-98% in control sites. Warming increased bulbils leaf length (Table S2 and S3; Figure 1) but had no effect on other measured parameters (Table S2 and S3). Combined all sample units (within OTCs and control areas), we recorded a decrease in LDMC and an increase in Fv/Fm as plant cover increased (Table S3; Figure 2A-B).\nFig. 1 Boxplot of leaf length of Furcraea foetida bulbils inside the open-top chambers (OTC) and in control sites.\nFig. 2 Relationship between physiological parameters of Furcraea foetida bulbils and percent plant cover on all sample sites combined (inside and outside OTCs) after examining the effect of other variables. (a) Added variable-plots (partialregression plots) of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and (b) photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm).\nDiscussion\nAlthough our warming did not reach the optimistic IPCC scenario of 0.6-2\u00b0C increases projected for 2100 (Magrin et al. 2014), a small temperature increase was able to generate short-term responses in F. foetida bulbils. This increase did stimulate bulbils growth in terms of leaf length. This responses, however, suggests that temperature is still within the optimal range for the species, as suggested also by Fv/Fm values of 0.82 both inside and outside OTCs (Table 3) typical for healthy leaves (Bjorkman and Demmig 1987). Recent reports show that increased CO2 and higher temperatures, especially at night (when CO2 fixation takes place) increased the productivity of CAM species (Garcia-Moya et al. 2010; Holtum and Winter 2014; Owen et al. 2015). Our OTCs did not heat at night, when temperature is critical for enzyme activity (Luttge 2004), and consequently did not lead to biomass gain.\nHigh plant cover influenced positively Fv/Fm values in our plants suggesting that, counterintuitively, high irradiance may be detrimental for this species. Plant cover may also help to maintain high soil water, indirectly enhancing photosynthetic performance (Song et al. 2010). The significant reduction in LDMC with increasing plant cover recorded in F. foetida can be related to greater water availability in shaded sites. In succulent species low LDMC may be directly related to SLA (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013) but in our site there was no relationship between LDMC and SLA; i.e., LDMC decreased while SLA did not, suggesting that plants may be nutrient-limited in this sandy soil since SLA responds to both shade and nutrient availability and should increase in shady places.\nSurprisingly, there was no effect of plant cover on leaf length, number of leaves, or bulbil dry mass, suggesting that shade favored water balance and photosynthesis, while other factors, for example, reduction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), may limit CO2 assimilation as shown elsewhere in succulent species, mostly cacti and agaves in desert environments (Franco and Nobel 1988; 1989). It has been reported that the grass species, Hilaria rigida, facilitated establishment of Agave deserti seedlings by reducing maximum soil temperature and by increasing nitrogen levels (Franco and Nobel 1988). However, low radiation in shaded areas reduced CO2 uptake and growth, of Agave deserti seedlings within thickets of the grass Hilaria rigida (Franco and Nobel 1988) the same as reported for seedlings of the cactus species, Carnegiea gigantea, growing under Ambrosia deltoidea and Cercidium microphyllum shrubs (Franco and Nobel 1989).\nThe physiological parameters evaluated in this study are important for determining F. foetida seedling ability to tolerate variations in temperature, light, water and CO2 in natural environments, which in turn are useful to assess colonization and establishment ability of potentially invasive species under a perspective of global climate change (Song et al. 2010). We conclude that, under demanding abiotic conditions, a small, short-term increase in temperature has a positive effect on leaf growth of F. foetida bulbils. We also evidenced that plant cover in the rocky shore facilitated the colonization of invasive species. Our data also emphasize that, since F. foetida is native to tropical regions where temperature is higher than in invaded subtropical regions of Brazil, this species is physiologically pre-adapted to tolerate high temperatures. Thus, we suggest that F. foetida may be favored in an optimistic scenario of climate change, increasing its negative effects on biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported by the CAPES/CNPq \"Science without Borders\" Program through the project \"Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems\" (No 114A-2013) and by the Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC).

Isto porque, ap\u00f3s a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o, suas popula\u00e7\u00f5es tem a capacidade de persistir sem interven\u00e7\u00e3o do homem, por per\u00edodos superiores a 10 anos, e tamb\u00e9m por seus prop\u00e1gulos vegetativos (bulbilhos) serem capazes de dispersar para dist\u00e2ncias maiores do que 100 m em menos do que 50 anos. Sua invasividade \u00e9 devida \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de milhares de bulbilhos que caem, em grande maioria, ao redor da planta m\u00e3e, resultando em adensamentos populacionais de indiv\u00edduos que chegam a atingir 4 m de di\u00e2metro de roseta. Furcraea foetida apresenta ampla capacidade fisiol\u00f3gica decorrente principalmente do armazenamento de \u00e1gua em suas folhas suculentas e do metabolismo CAM fotossint\u00e9tico. Essas caracter\u00edsticas morfofisiol\u00f3gicas e a sua estrat\u00e9gia de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o clonal permitem que \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie possa prosperar em muitas zonas clim\u00e1ticas. Al\u00e9m disso, a dispers\u00e3o cont\u00ednua pelo homem, atualmente para uso como ornamental ou cercas-vivas, aumenta o risco de invas\u00e3o pela esp\u00e9cie.\nNo primeiro cap\u00edtulo deste trabalho, onde realizamos um estudo de modelagem de nicho ecol\u00f3gico, observamos que o modelo constru\u00eddo com dados ambientais e ocorr\u00eancias de F. foetida no Brasil quando projetado para a \u00e1rea nativa refor\u00e7ou a hip\u00f3tese existente de que a esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 origin\u00e1ria da bacia do rio Orinoco, bacia amaz\u00f4nica e ilhas do Caribe. Conclu\u00edmos que no Brasil a esp\u00e9cie ex\u00f3tica estabeleceu-se principalmente no leste do pa\u00eds, invadindo, sobretudo ecossistemas costeiros. Durante o processo de invas\u00e3o, F. foetida ocupou no Brasil uma parte do seu nicho fundamental que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel na \u00e1rea nativa (Am\u00e9rica Central e norte da Am\u00e9rica do Sul), expandindo o seu nicho realizado para regi\u00f5es com maior amplitude de temperatura e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o no trimestre mais quente, que \u00e9 caracter\u00edstico de clima subtropical. O teste de similaridade de nicho indicou que as diferen\u00e7as de nicho realizado s\u00e3o devido a diferen\u00e7as na disponibilidade de habitat entre as duas \u00e1reas (nativa e invadida) e n\u00e3o devido a mudan\u00e7as evolutivas. O modelo constru\u00eddo com dados ambientais da \u00e1rea nativa quando foi projetado para o Brasil (exceto regi\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica) indicou que as regi\u00f5es de alto risco de invas\u00e3o por F. foetida s\u00e3o no Cerrado e regi\u00f5es mais interiores da Mata Atl\u00e2ntica, onde ainda h\u00e1 baixa evid\u00eancia de ocorr\u00eancia da esp\u00e9cie. Importante ressaltar que apesar de os modelos de nicho ecol\u00f3gico ter limita\u00e7\u00f5es metodol\u00f3gicas, estes estudos s\u00e3o um importante instrumento de aux\u00edlio para a preven\u00e7\u00e3o de invas\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas.\nJ\u00e1 no segundo cap\u00edtulo, as an\u00e1lises gen\u00e9ticas evidenciaram que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras de F. foetida no Brasil possuem n\u00edveis similares de diversidade gen\u00e9tica com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s popula\u00e7\u00f5es nativas da Guiana Francesa, n\u00e3o apresentando, em geral, efeito negativo de gargalo populacional. Observamos tamb\u00e9m que h\u00e1 alta varia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica entre indiv\u00edduos dentro das popula\u00e7\u00f5es, sugerindo que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da costa atl\u00e2ntica brasileira s\u00e3o provenientes de m\u00faltiplas fontes de introdu\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao mesmo tempo, a baixa diverg\u00eancia entre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es e a aus\u00eancia de correla\u00e7\u00e3o com a dist\u00e2ncia geogr\u00e1fica entre elas indicou que a dispers\u00e3o pelo homem tem desempenhado um papel fundamental na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da diversidade gen\u00e9tica de F. foetida. Sugerimos ainda que algum ac\u00famulo de varia\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo do ciclo de vida da planta, que pode atingir at\u00e9 20 anos, pode ser decorrente de muta\u00e7\u00f5es nas c\u00e9lulas som\u00e1ticas. Orientamos que pesquisas futuras devem abranger uma gama maior de popula\u00e7\u00f5es na escala nativa, incluindo diferentes tipos de habitats, o que permitir\u00e1 uma melhor compreens\u00e3o da estrutura gen\u00e9tica e consequentemente, do hist\u00f3rico de invas\u00e3o desta planta clonal invasora.\nNo terceiro e \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo, com base no experimento com c\u00e2maras de topo aberto, constatamos que um aumento na temperatura m\u00e9dia di\u00e1ria do ar de apenas 0.4\u00b0C em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 temperatura ambiente, em curto prazo (cinco meses) aumentou o crescimento foliar dos bulbilhos de F. foetida. Este resultado sugere que a esp\u00e9cie pode se tornar mais agressiva em um cen\u00e1rio mais otimista de aquecimento global (um aumento na m\u00e9dia da temperatura anual 0.6oC-2.0\u00b0C) previsto pelo IPCC para o final de 2100, visto que as fases iniciais de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e estabelecimento poder\u00e3o ser favorecidas. Este resultado tamb\u00e9m refor\u00e7a o atual risco de a esp\u00e9cie se estabelecer com sucesso e se tornar invasora em regi\u00f5es que apresentam m\u00e9dias de temperaturas mais quentes do que o sul do Brasil, como a regi\u00e3o do Cerrado, previsto no primeiro cap\u00edtulo. Observamos ainda que houve maior quantidade de armazenamento de \u00e1gua nas folhas e a efici\u00eancia fotossint\u00e9tica foi aumentada em s\u00edtios com alto sombreamento, evidenciando a import\u00e2ncia da facilita\u00e7\u00e3o nos est\u00e1gios iniciais do ciclo de vida de F. foetida.\nAssim, esta tese evidenciou o alto potencial de F. foetida se estabelecer com sucesso n\u00e3o somente ao longo de toda a costa Atl\u00e2ntica brasileira, mas tamb\u00e9m nas regi\u00f5es mais interiores do pa\u00eds como no planalto central. Considerando que a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e controle dos principais riscos de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas em unidades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e suas zonas de amortecimento s\u00e3o previstas pelo Sistema Nacional de\nUnidades de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o (SNUC - LEI 9.985/2000), recomendamos que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de F. foet\u00edda como planta ornamental, assim como o seu plantio para qualquer fim, seja proibida dentro das unidades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o no Brasil. Recomendamos ainda que os planos de controle das popula\u00e7\u00f5es j\u00e1 estabelecidas priorizem o monitoramento das plantas reprodutivas, para que se cortem os pend\u00f5es de infloresc\u00eancias antes da forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos bulbilhos. Recomendamos ainda que os esfor\u00e7os de controle devem especialmente considerar os locais com maior cobertura da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa visto que os bulbilhos tem maior chance de sobreviv\u00eancia e estabelecimento na presen\u00e7a de esp\u00e9cies facilitadoras."}]}}}
