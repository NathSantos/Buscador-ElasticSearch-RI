Ara\u00e7atuba: Universidade Estadual \nPaulista; 2009.\n\nRESUMO \n\nAvaliou-se a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de fl\u00faor (F) no biofilme dent\u00e1rio e fluido do biofilme ap\u00f3s o uso de \ndentifr\u00edcios convencional(DC) e com concentra\u00e7\u00e3o reduzida de F(DCR). A hip\u00f3tese do estudo foi de \nque o uso do DCR levaria a uma incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o proporcionalmente mais alta no biofilme, \nprincipalmente nas camadas mais profundas do mesmo, e que estes aumentos seriam refletidos no \nfluido do biofilme. Na primeira etapa, foram comparadas as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F e c\u00e1lcio (Ca) presentes \nno biofilme ap\u00f3s o uso de dentifr\u00edcios contendo 0 (dentifr\u00edcio placebo\u2013DP), 513(DCR) e 1.072(DC) \nppm F, em crian\u00e7as residentes em comunidades contendo 0,04(A), 0,72(B) e 3,36(C) ppm F na \u00e1gua \nde abastecimento.  Seguindo um protocolo duplo-cego e cruzado, as crian\u00e7as escovaram seus dentes 2 \nvezes ao dia, durante 7 dias. Amostras de biofilme foram coletadas 1 e 12 horas ap\u00f3s a \u00faltima \nescova\u00e7\u00e3o. Na segunda e terceira etapas, conduzidas somente na comunidade B, avaliou-se a \nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de F em sec\u00e7\u00f5es seriais de biofilme formado utilizando \u201cdispositivos in situ de Leeds\u201d, \nbem como a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de F no fluido do biofilme, respectivamente, empregando o protocolo \ndescrito anteriormente. As an\u00e1lises de F foram realizadas ap\u00f3s extra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cida (biofilme total), por \ncromatografia i\u00f4nica (sec\u00e7\u00f5es de biofilme) e ap\u00f3s tamponamento com TISAB III (fluido do biofilme). \nAs an\u00e1lises de Ca foram realizadas por espectrometria de absor\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00f4mica (primeira e segunda \netapas) e por m\u00e9todo colorim\u00e9trico (terceira etapa). Os dados foram analisados por ANOVA, testes de \nTukey e Bonferroni e An\u00e1lise de Regress\u00e3o Linear (p<0,05). Na primeira etapa, as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F \nestavam diretamente relacionadas \u00e0s concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F na \u00e1gua de abastecimento, \nindependentemente do dentifr\u00edcio utilizado. O uso dos dentifr\u00edcios fluoretados levou a aumentos \nsignificativos nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F no biofilme 1h ap\u00f3s o uso dos mesmos nas comunidades A e B \napenas. Aumentos virtualmente id\u00eanticos foram observados 1h ap\u00f3s a escova\u00e7\u00e3o com o DCR (ca.1,9 \nmmolF/kg) e DC (ca.2,4 mmolF/kg) nas comunidades A e B quando comparados ao DP; estes \naumentos foram menos pronunciados na comunidade C. Para a segunda etapa, observou-se que o F se \nrestringiu principalmente \u00e0s camadas mais externas do biofilme para todos os dentifr\u00edcios, tendo sido \nobservado um padr\u00e3o semelhante para o Ca. Os valores obtidos para DC foram significativamente \nmaiores que os obtidos para o DP. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F e Ca estiveram positiva e significativamente \nrelacionadas na maioria das sec\u00e7\u00f5es do biofilme. Quanto \u00e0 terceira etapa, as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de F no \nbiofilme total apresentaram um padr\u00e3o semelhante ao observado para a primeira etapa; no entanto, \nestas n\u00e3o foram refletidas no fluido do biofilme. Houve uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o positiva e significativa entre as \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de fl\u00faor e c\u00e1lcio no biofilme total para a maioria das situa\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas.

Fluoride uptake by dental biofilm and biofilm fluid after the use of conventional \nand low-fluoride dentifrices in communities with different fluoride levels in the drinking \nwater [thesis]. Ara\u00e7atuba: S\u00e3o Paulo State University; 2009.\n\nABSTRACT \n\nThis study evaluated fluoride (F) uptake by dental biofilm and biofilm fluid after the use of \nconventional (CD) and low-fluoride (LFD) dentifrices. The hypothesis of the study was that the use of \nLDF would lead to a proportionally higher F uptake by the biofilm, mainly in the deepest layers of it, \nand that such increases would be reflected in the biofilm fluid. In the first phase, F and calcium (Ca) \nconcentrations in the biofilm were compared after the use of dentifrices containing 0 (placebo \ndentifrice\u2013PD), 513 and 1,072 ppm F, in children living in communities containing 0.04(A), 0.72(B) \nand 3.36(C) ppm F in the drinking water. Following a double-blind, crossover protocol, children \nbrushed their teeth twice daily, during seven days. Samples of biofilm were collected on the seventh \nday, 1 and 12 h after the last use of the dentifrices. In the second and third phases, which were \nconducted only in the community B, we evaluated F uptake in serial sections of biofilms formed using \nthe \u201cLeeds in situ devices\u201d, as well as in the biofilm fluid, respectively, following the same protocol \ndescribed for the first phase. F analyses were carried out after acid extraction (whole biofilm), by ion \nchromatography (sections of biofilm) and after buffering with TISAB III (biofilm fluid). Analyses of \nCa were done by atomic absorption spectrometry (first and second phases) and colorimetrically (third \nphase). Results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey\u2019s and Bonferroni\u2019s tests, by linear regression \nanalysis and by Pearson\u2019s correlation (p<0.05). For the first phase, mean biofilm F concentrations \nwere directly related to F concentrations in water, regardless of the dentifrice used. The use of the \nfluoridated dentifrices led to significant increases in F concentrations in the biofilm 1 h after their use, \nin the communities A and B only. Virtually identical increases were observed 1 h after brushing with \nCD (ca.1.9 mmolF/kg) and LFD (ca.2.4 mmolF/kg) in the communities A and B when compared to \nPD. These increases were less pronounced in the community C. For the second phase, it was observed \nthat F was mostly restricted to the outer layers of biofilm for all the dentifrices tested, and a similar \npattern was observed for Ca. The values obtained for CD were significantly higher than those \nobserved for PD. F and Ca concentrations were positively and significantly correlated throughout most \nof biofilms\u2019 sections. For the third phase, F concentrations in whole biofilm showed a similar pattern \nto that observed for the first phase; however, F levels were not reflected in the biofilm fluid. Positive \nand significant correlations were verified among F and Ca concentrations in whole biofilm for most of \nthe situations evaluated. The results confirm the hypothesis that the use of the LFD leads to a \nproportionally higher F uptake by the biofilm when compared to CD and also corroborate previous \nfindings showing that F uptake by the biofilm is dependent on Ca concentrations.

Em diversos pa\u00edses ocidentais, as formas mais amplamente difundidas do uso dos \n\nfluoretos s\u00e3o a \u00e1gua, com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es usualmente em torno de 1 \u00b5g F/mL, e dentifr\u00edcios, \n\ntipicamente contendo 1.000-1.500 \u00b5g F/g. \n\nApesar da grande diferen\u00e7a entre as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de fl\u00faor dos dois m\u00e9todos, estudos \n\nepidemiol\u00f3gicos t\u00eam demonstrado um maior efeito da \u00e1gua fluoretada no controle da c\u00e1rie \n\ndent\u00e1ria em compara\u00e7\u00e3o aos dentifr\u00edcios fluoretados (O\u00b4Mullane, 19904, Mellberg, 19905, \n\nMarinho et al., 20036).

Um dos principais achados do estudo de Pessan et al.

Children used the toothpastes twice daily, for 1 \n\nweek. Samples were collected 1 and 12h after the last use of dentifrices and were analyzed for \n\nfluoride and calcium. Results were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and linear regression \n\nanalysis. Similar increases were found 1h after brushing with LF (ca.1.9 mmolF/kg) and C \n\n(ca.2.4 mmolF/kg) in the 0.04 and 0.72 ppmF communities. Despite the increases were less \n\npronounced in the 3.36 ppmF community, our results indicate that the use of a LF promotes a \n\nproportionally higher increase in plaque [F] when compared to C. \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  18\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nA series of studies has been conducted to evaluate the effect of fluoridated toothpastes on \n\nfluoride uptake by plaque and its retention throughout the day in communities with sub-\n\noptimal (Whitford et al., 2005), optimal (Whitford et al., 2002; Pessan et al., 2006) and \n\nabove-optimal (Pessan et al., 2008) water fluoride concentrations. Although small differences \n\nwere found in the results among the studies, all of them agreed that intraoral fluoride levels \n\nwere directly related to water fluoride concentrations regardless the dentifrice used, and that \n\nfluoride uptake by plaque is dependent on plaque calcium concentrations. Furthermore, \n\nbecause the latest study was conducted simultaneously in children from communities with \n\n0.04, 0.85 and 3.5 ?g F/mL in water, it was possible to observe for the first time that the \n\nincrements in fluoride levels in plaque 1 h after brushing were virtually identical in each \n\ncommunity. \n\nThe reasons for this phenomenon, also found in a study conducted in individuals of similar \n\nage range and socioeconomic background (Whitford et al., 2005), are still not clear. \n\nConsidering that fluoride levels in toothpaste are much higher than those found in water, it \n\nwas expected that the use of fluoridated dentifrice could equalise the amount of fluoride \n\nretained in plaque 1 h after brushing, regardless the background fluoride exposure from water, \n\nbut this did not happen. These findings led the investigators to hypothesize that fluoride in \n\nlow concentration sources, as in water, penetrates deeper into plaque when compared to a \n\nhigh fluoride source, like dentifrice, since the use of these products could lead to the \n\nformation of salivary CaF+/CaF2 compounds, which would migrate predominantly onto \n\nplaque surface (Watson et al., 2005; Whitford et al., 2005, Pessan et al., 2008). \n\nConsidering this hypothesis, it would be possible that the use of a dentifrice with a lower \n\nfluoride concentration could lead to a proportionally higher fluoride uptake by plaque when \n\ncompared to a dentifrice containing 1,000-1,100 mgF/Kg. Since there is no agreement about \n\nthe clinical efficacy of low-fluoride dentifrices on caries control when compared to \n\nconventional dentifrices (Ammari et al., 2003), the validation of this hypothesis could be \n\nuseful for a better comprehension of the effects of such formulations on intraoral fluoride \n\nlevels, which was demonstrated to be directly related to the clinical efficacy of topical \n\nfluoridated products (Duckworth et al., 1992).  \n\nThus, the present study was conducted following the same protocol of the study by Pessan et \n\nal. (2008) in order to verify if similar increments of fluoride would be found in plaque after \n\nthe use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices, in communities with different fluoride \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  19\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nlevels in water, and if the low-fluoride dentifrice would promote a proportionally higher \n\nfluoride retention in plaque in comparison to the conventional dentifrice. \n\nMATERIALS &amp; METHODS \n\nFifty-six 8-10-year-old Brazilian children from cities with different water fluoride \n\nconcentrations, Piraju\u00ed (0.04 ppm, n=19), Bauru (0.72 ppm, n=20) and Brejo das Freiras (3.36 \n\nppm, n=17), participated. Water fluoride concentrations were determined weekly through \n\nanalysis of 4 samples from volunteers\u2019 homes. Sample size was established at 15 subjects per \n\ngroup in order to obtain a power of 80% (?=0.05), based on a study conducted with the same \n\nprotocol (Pessan et al., 2008). As inclusion criteria, the children were permanent residents of \n\ntheir community and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, attended the same public \n\nschool where samples were collected, and drank tap water exclusively. The protocol was \n\napproved by the IRB of Bauru Dental School1 and informed consent was obtained from \n\nchildren\u2019s parents2.  \n\nThe study began with a dental prophylaxis to remove all plaque and calculus. The protocol of \n\nthe study, described in detail in previous publications (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005, Pessan et \n\nal., 2006, 2008), followed a double-blind, crossover design, in which the volunteers were \n\nrandomly assigned (blocking stratification) to brush with a conventional fluoride dentifrice \n\n(Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 mgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free \n\nplacebo. The dentifrices\u2019 tubes were coded by a researcher not involved in the present study. \n\nThey used these products for 1.0 min in the morning and at bedtime for one week and rinsed \n\nwith 10 mL of water3. The abrasive system in the calcium-free products was hydrated silica. \n\nDuring the sixth day, children brushed only the occlusal surfaces to allow plaque \n\naccumulation. After going to bed, they refrained from eating or drinking anything except \n\nwater and did not brush their teeth until the following morning. On the following morning, \n\nplaque was collected from the right side of mouth; children then brushed the occlusal surfaces \n\nfor 1.0 min and rinsed with 10 mL of tap water. One hour later plaque (left side) was again \n\ncollected. Thus the samples were collected 1.0 hr and approximately 12 hr after the last use of \n\nthe dentifrices. The entire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously \n\nused. \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n1 Anexos 4 a 6 \n2 Anexo 7 \n3 Anexo 8 \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  20\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nPlaque samples were dried at 95\u00b0C and weighed to the nearest microgram. Fluoride in plaque \n\nwas determined after extraction with 0.5 M HClO4 which was buffered with TISAB I (Orion \n\nResearch)4. Calcium concentrations were determined by AAS using an aliquot of the HClO4\ndigests of plaque. All analyses were done in duplicate and the coefficients of variability were \n\n6.9% and 7.1%, respectively for fluoride and calcium. \n\nThe results are expressed as mean \u00b1 se. The outcomes were not normally distributed so log \n\ntransformations were performed. A three-factor repeated measures ANOVA was then used to \n\nexamine differences in each outcome. For pairwise comparisons, Tukey\u2019s and Bonferroni\u2019s \n\ntests were used, respectively for fluoride and calcium concentrations in plaque. The two fixed \n\neffect factors were fluoride dentifrice and time after toothbrushing and the independent factor \n\nwas community. A significance level of 5% was selected. \n\nRESULTS \n\nMean plaque fluoride concentrations were directly related to the water fluoride concentrations \n\nregardless the dentifrice used (Table 1). Significant interactions were observed between the \n\nfactors communities and treatments (p<0.05), as well as between communities and time after \n\nbrushing (p<0.001). For Piraju\u00ed and Bauru, the use of the fluoridated pastes led to significant \n\nincreases in plaque fluoride concentrations when compared to the placebo dentifrice 1h after \n\nbrushing. No differences were verified between 1 and 12h after brushing with the fluoridated \n\ndentifrices, except for Piraju\u00ed. For Brejo das Freiras, no significant differences were observed \n\nregardless of the dentifrice used and time after brushing. \n\nAlthough the values obtained for Bauru were numerically higher than those from Piraju\u00ed \n\n(Table 1), a similar trend was observed for fluoride uptake by plaque (1h after brushing) in \n\nthese communities (Figure 1). The increments in fluoride concentration 1h after brushing with \n\nthe 513 mgF/Kg toothpaste were virtually identical (around 1.9 mmol F/kg).  For the 1,072 \n\nmgF/Kg dentifrice the same trend was verified, with a mean increase around 2.4 mmolF/Kg \n\n1h after brushing. Regarding the differences between fluoride concentrations in plaque 1 and \n\n12h after brushing with the fluoride dentifrices (plaque fluoride clearance), plaque fluoride \n\nconcentrations in Piraju\u00ed and Bauru decreased about 43% 12h after brushing compared to the \n\nvalues found 1h after brushing for the 513 mgF/Kg dentifrice (Figure 2). For the 1,072 \n\nmgF/Kg dentifrice, the % decrease was less uniform (47% and 30%, respectively, for Piraju\u00ed \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n4 Anexo 9 \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  21\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nand Bauru). For Brejo das Freiras, however, both the increases and decreases in plaque \n\nfluoride concentrations were considerably lower when compared to the other communities. \n\nRegarding calcium concentrations in plaque, there was an interaction between the factors \n\ncommunity and time of sample collection (p<0.001), so that no pattern could be observed \n\n(Table 2). Overall, the data observed in Bauru were numerically higher than those observed in \n\nthe other communities.  \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe studies conducted by Whitford et al. (2002, 2005) led to the hypothesis that the high \n\nfluoride levels in saliva after the use of a dentifrice would promote the formation of \n\nCaF+/CaF2 compounds. These would be less likely to migrate into the deeper layers of plaque \n\nwhen compared to the ionic form of fluoride present in water, but instead accumulate mainly \n\nin the outer layers (Watson et al., 2005; Whitford et al., 2005). Although this hypothesis was \n\nnot fully tested, the results of the study by Pessan et al. (2008) provided additional evidence \n\nfor it. In their study, an average increase of 6.5 mmol F/Kg was found in plaque 1 h after \n\nbrushing with a 1,030 mgF/Kg dentifrice and these decreased at a similar rate (around 50%) \n\nfor all communities, regardless the baseline fluoride levels in plaque associated with the \n\nregular consumption of water. In order to better understand this phenomenon, the present \n\nstudy was conducted using the same protocol described in the previous studies, but this time \n\nincluding a low-fluoride dentifrice, to allow dose-response observations.  \n\nPlaque fluoride concentrations were directly related to fluoride concentrations in the drinking \n\nwater, for all dentifrices used and times of sample collection, confirming the findings obtained \n\nby Pessan et al. (2008). However, the increments in plaque fluoride concentrations were about \n\n2-fold lower than those previously observed. The reasons for this are not evident. Both in the \n\npresent study and in that by Pessan et al. (2008) samples were collected in the same season. \n\nThus, variations due to differences in water consumption may not be the case. Additionally, \n\ncare was taken in order to reproduce as much as possible the study by Pessan et al. (2008), so \n\nchildren from the same communities and same age range were selected and fluoride \n\nconcentrations in the conventional dentifrices were virtually identical. The only difference \n\nbetween the studies was the volume of water to rinse the mouth after brushing, reduced from \n\n30 mL (Pessan et al., 2008) to 10 mL, which is more adequate for children (Issa and Toumba, \n\n2004); thus at least similar (if not higher) plaque fluoride levels could be expected. The only \n\nfactor that might help to explain the lower values found in the present work is the amount of \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  22\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nsodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) in the dentifrices. This anionic surfactant has strong affinity for \n\ncalcium, which could affect fluoride uptake by plaque from a fluoride dentifrice (Whitford, \n\npersonal communication). However, as the same source of the dentifrices was used in the \n\npresent study and the other studies, this possibility does not seem to be the only explanation \n\nfor the observed difference. \n\nDespite the unexpected lower values found in the present study, it was still possible to verify \n\nsimilar increments in plaque fluoride concentrations 1h after the use of low-fluoride (ca.1.9 \n\nmmolF/kg) and conventional (ca. 2.4 mmolF/kg) dentifrices, for the communities of Piraju\u00ed \n\nand Bauru, when comparing these values with the placebo levels, although these increases \n\nwere considerably lower in the 3.36 ppmF community. It is noteworthy that considering the 2-\n\nfold difference between fluoride concentrations in both toothpastes, a 100% increment of that \n\nobtained for the low-fluoride dentifrice would be expected after using the conventional \n\ndentifrice (around 3.8 mmol F/kg), but these were only around 63% higher (ca. 2.4 mmol \n\nF/kg). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the use of low-fluoride \n\ndentifrices promotes a proportionally higher uptake of fluoride by plaque when compared to \n\nconventional dentifrices. The lower fluoride concentration in the 513 mgF/Kg dentifrice \n\nwould promote less formation of CaF2 and CaF+ compounds in saliva immediately after \n\nbrushing, when compared to the 1,072 mgF/Kg dentifrice. Thus, it is reasonable to assume \n\nthat a proportionally higher amount of fluoride in the ionic form would be present in saliva, \n\nwhich would be attracted as counterions to calcium bound to fixed acidic groups in plaque \n\n(R\u00f8lla, 1977; R\u00f8lla and Bowen, 1977) and bacterial cell surfaces (Rose et al., 1993, 1994, \n\n1996 and 1997). This mechanism is in agreement with the study by Watson et al. (2005) \n\nwhich demonstrated that fluoride is restricted mainly to the outer layers of dental plaque after \n\nexposure to a NaF solution.   \n\nAnother point that deserves attention regards the kinetics of fluoride clearance from dental \n\nplaque after the use of fluoride dentifrices, which seems to be different for low-fluoride and \n\nconventional dentifrices and also depends on the fluoride levels present in plaque from other \n\nsources than dentifrice (i.e., water). This is evident when we observe Figure 2. For the 513 \n\nmgF/Kg dentifrice, ~ 40% of the fluoride incorporated in dental plaque at 1h was removed \n\nfrom plaque after 12h in Piraju\u00ed and Bauru. However, in Brejo das Freiras, the clearance was \n\nmuch lower (~26%). Moreover, when a dentifrice with twice the fluoride concentration was \n\nused, the clearance remained unaltered for Piraju\u00ed, but was lower for Bauru (~30%), while in \n\nBrejo das Freiras practically there was no clearance. These findings suggest that in conditions \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 1  23\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nof low fluoride supply (from water and/or dentifrice), the fluoride clearance from plaque is \n\nslower, while conditions of high supply may lead to faster plaque fluoride clearance. This \n\nmay be due to the fact that in Brejo das Freiras the frequent exposure to water may have \n\nreplenished the plaque fluoride reservoirs.  \n\nAccording to a recent meta-analysis, no conclusion could be taken regarding the effectiveness \n\nof 500-550 mgF/Kg dentifrices against conventional formulations due to the lack of \n\nrandomized controlled trials addressing this subject (Ammari et al., 2003). Although the \n\npresent study did not investigate the effectiveness of low-fluoride dentifrices on caries \n\nprevalence, intraoral fluoride retention has been directly related to the clinical efficacy of \n\ntopical products (Duckworth et al., 1992). Thus, considering that the low-fluoride formulation \n\nled to a proportionally higher retention of fluoride in plaque, it is possible that the differences \n\nbetween the clinical performances of low-fluoride and conventional toothpastes are lower \n\nthan expected. This concept is supported by a recent randomized clinical trial that \n\ndemonstrated that the use of low-fluoride toothpastes was as effective as the conventional \n\nformulation in preventing caries in caries-inactive, but not in caries-active children (Lima et \n\nal., 2008). Thus, based on caries-risk considerations, the use of low-fluoride formulations \n\ncould constitute in a good alternative for caries control children, while minimizing the risk of \n\ndental fluorosis. \n\nThe results of the present study provide additional information on the mechanism of fluoride \n\nuptake by plaque after the use of dentifrices with different fluoride concentrations, indicating \n\nthat a proportionally higher amount of fluoride is retained in plaque after the use of low-\n\nfluoride dentifrices compared to conventional formulations. Future studies, however, are \n\nneeded in order to fully address this question. Information on the fluoride concentration in \n\nplaque fluid and in serial sections of dental plaque could help to clarify this mechanism.  \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThis investigation was supported by FAPESP (2005/03426-2 and 06/07258-0) and CNPq \n\n(471395/2006-4).

We hypothesized that \n\nfluoride would be deposited predominantly in outer layers of plaque after exposure to CD, \n\nwhereas it would migrate into deeper layers during exposure to LFD. This randomized, \n\ndouble-blind study evaluated fluoride and calcium distribution in sections of plaque biofilms \n\ngenerated in situ. Children brushed with a placebo dentifrice (PD), LFD and CD for 1 week \n\n(crossover design) and intact biofilms were collected 1 and 12 h after brushing. Fluoride and \n\ncalcium were mostly restricted to the outer layers of biofilms for all dentifrices tested, and \n\nthese ions were directly related throughout most of biofilm\u2019s layers. Results for CD were \n\nsignificantly higher than those for PD, but did not differ from those obtained for LFD. Unlike \n\nour hypothesis, the use of LFD did not promote a higher F uptake in inner layers of biofilms.  \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  33\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nINTRODUCTION  \n\nRecent data has indicated that use of a fluoridated dentifrice (~1,000 \u00b5g F/g) resulted in \n\nvirtual identical increases in plaque fluoride concentrations, which decreased at a similar rate, \n\nregardless of exposure to different local levels of fluoride in the drinking water (Pessan et al., \n\n2008). This raises questions concerning the control of fluoride uptake by dental plaque in \n\nrelation to exposure to exogenous fluoride. Whitford et al. (2005) proposed that high levels of \n\nsalivary fluoride during exposure to a conventional dentifrice (1,000-1,100 \u00b5g F/g) could lead \n\nto the deposition of CaF2/CaF+ compounds at the plaque/saliva interface, effectively forming \n\nsome kind of a partial barrier at plaque surfaces to limit ionic fluoride diffusion into deeper \n\nregions.  However, based on the solubility product for CaF2, this effect would be attenuated \n\nwith low fluoride sources because smaller amounts of insoluble calcium compounds would be \n\nformed. It would be reasonable to expect, therefore, that a low-fluoride dentifrice would lead \n\nto a lower formation of CaF2/CaF+ and, as a result, ionic fluoride could penetrate more easily \n\ninto deeper layers of plaque biofilms. \n\nThere is evidence that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice promotes a proportionally higher \n\nfluoride uptake by plaque when compared to a conventional dentifrice. The use of a dentifrice \n\ncontaining 513 \u00b5g F/g led to an increase around 1.9 mmol F/Kg in plaque fluoride \n\nconcentrations 1 h after brushing, in communities with 0.04 and 0.72 ppm F in water. \n\nConsidering a dose-response relationship, when a dentifrice containing 1,072 \u00b5gF/g was used \n\nthe authors expected values twice higher than those obtained for the low-fluoride dentifrice \n\n(around 3.8 mmolF/Kg), but the increases observed were around 2.4 mmolF/Kg (Pessan et al., \n\npersonal communication). This study add to the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis \n\ndescribed above. The localization of fluoride in plaque after using conventional and low-\n\nfluoride dentifrices, however, is unclear. In plaque biofilms exposed to a 1,000 ppm NaF \n\nsolution, fluoride is restricted mainly in the outer layers (Watson et al., 2005), but no direct \n\ninformation is available for dentifrices, which are the most widespread form of topical use of \n\nfluorides. \n\nWith regard to calcium, there is a positive relationship between fluoride and calcium in whole \n\nplaque (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005). Like fluoride, calcium tends to accumulate in the outer \n\nregions of plaque after exposure to fluoridated solutions (Robinson et al., 1997) but there is no \n\ninformation available on calcium concentrations in different layers of biofilm after the use of \n\nfluoride dentifrice.  \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  34\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nBased on the mechanism proposed by Whitford et al. (2005) and on the information presented \n\nabove, we have investigated the possibility that after exposure to a conventional dentifrice, \n\nfluoride would be retained predominantly in outer layers of plaque whereas it would migrate \n\nto deeper layers when a low-fluoride dentifrice was used. We also investigated the \n\nrelationship between calcium and fluoride after such exposures. \n\nMATERIALS &amp; METHODS \n\nStudy protocol \n\nEleven 8-10-year-old Brazilian children from an optimally fluoridated community (Bauru, \n\n0.72 ppm in the public water supply) participated. As inclusion criteria, children were from \n\nsimilar socioeconomic backgrounds, attended the same public school where samples were \n\ncollected, and only drank tap water. The protocol was approved by the IRB of Bauru Dental \n\nSchool1 and informed consent was obtained from parents prior to the beginning of the study2. \n\nPlaque biofilms were generated using the 'Leeds In Situ Device', constructed as described by \n\nRobinson et al. (1997), except that devices\u2019 rings were made by composite-resin instead of \n\nnylon3 (for sterilization procedures, please see Watson et al., 2004). Following a double-blind, \n\ncrossover design, the volunteers were randomly assigned (blocking stratification) to brush with \n\na conventional fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 \n\nmgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free placebo for one week. After initial prophylaxis, one device was \n\nbonded to the buccal surface of each first upper molar by composite resin and worn for one \n\nweek. During this time, children were instructed to brush twice daily, preferably avoiding the \n\nareas in which the devices had been bonded. They used approximately 0.5 g of the dentifrice \n\nsupplied and rinsed their mouth with 10 mL of water after brushing4. After 7 days, devices were \n\nde-bonded and recovered intact 1 and approximately 12 hours after the last brushing episode. \n\nThe devices with undisturbed plaque in situ were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The \n\nentire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously used. \n\nSample Embedding and Sectioning \n\nThe protocol described by Watson et al. (2005) was followed. After overnight lyophilization \n\n(-50\u00b0C, 50 mbar vacuum), the devices were transferred to polyethylene capsules, impregnated \n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n1 Anexos 4 a 6 \n2 Anexo 10 \n3 Anexo 11 \n4 Anexo 12 \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  35\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nwith methacrylate5 (24% v/v methylmethacrylate, 75% v/v butylmethacrylate, 1% v/v benzoyl \n\nperoxide) under vacuum for 30 min, which was then polymerized by overnight incubation \n\n(60\u00b0C)6. Embedded plaque was serially sectioned in a plane parallel to the underlying enamel \n\nsubstratum (starting on the uppermost surface of the resin ring), using an ultramicrotome \n\n(Reichert, Vienna, Austria). The sectioning regime was: 5\u00d75 \u00b5m sections, followed by 1\u00d74 \n\n\u00b5m section and a further 5\u00d75 \u00b5m sections. Each group of ten 5 \u00b5m sections was collected in \n\nan Eppendorf tube pooled to give a single plaque fluoride and calcium measurement. The 4 \n\n\u00b5m sections were dried on glass slides for image analysis and determination of biomass \n\nfraction. This sectioning regime was repeated throughout biofilm\u2019s depth until the enamel \n\nsurface was reached7. \n\nDetermination of Fluoride and Calcium Concentrations in Plaque Sections \n\nChloroform (50 \u00b5L) was used to dissolve and disperse methacrylate from plaque sections in \n\neach Eppendorf tube. Tubes were then centrifuged (20,000 rpm, 30 min) and subsequently \n\nkept with lids open, allowing the chloroform to evaporate. Fluoride was extracted by \n\novernight immersion in water (Duckworth et al., 1994) and analyzed by ion chromatography8. \n\nCalcium was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Kato et al., 1997). \n\nDetermination of Fluoride and Calcium Concentrations in Biomass of Plaque Sections \n\nSections of 4 \u00b5m were stained with 0.1% aqueous toluidine blue to reveal plaque biomass. \n\nImages were captured by a video camera (JVC 3-CCD) and analyzed with Zeiss KS300 \n\nImaging Software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), allowing the calculation of the area occupied by \n\nstained biomass9. Since the section thickness was known, plaque biomass volume within the \n\nsection could be calculated. From these data, we were able to estimate fluoride and calcium \n\nconcentrations in the plaque biomass, by dividing the total fluoride in each plaque section by \n\nthe measured biomass fraction (Watson et al., 2005). \n\nData (log transformed) were analyzed by two- and three-factor repeated measures ANOVA, \n\nrespectively for sections analyzed together (sum of all sections for each device) and \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n5 Anexo 13 \n6 Anexo 14 \n7 Anexo 15 \n8 Foi utilizado um aparelho de cromatografia i\u00f4nica (Metrohm UK Ltda, Herisau, Su\u00ed\u00e7a) e o software Metrohm \nIC (vers\u00e3o 2.3).

Linear regression analysis was used to verify the relationship \n\nbetween F and Ca in plaque. A significance level of 5% was selected. \n\nRESULTS \n\nMean biofilm thickness was 848 (\u00b1101) \u00b5m, and ranged from 513 to 945 \u00b5m. Individual \n\ngraphs for each device were plotted before performing ANOVA, revealing that both F and Ca \n\nwere mainly restricted to the outer layers of plaque. Since an equal number of observations is \n\nneeded to perform ANOVA, data were arranged taking the biofilm/saliva interface as the \n\nstarting point for all the devices, so all the layers deeper than 513 \u00b5m (10th layer) were not \n\nincluded in this first statistical analysis. To determine whether there were any differences \n\namong the treatments close to dental surface (where de/remineralization processes occur), \n\nsecond statistical analysis was then performed. This second analysis was performed with \n\nenamel surface as the starting point for the 4 inner layers. Thus, ANOVA was performed for \n\nboth the 10 outer layers and for the 4 inner layers of the plaque biofilms. \n\nFor fluoride data, significant differences among treatments (F=6.547, p=0.007) and depths \n\n(F=51.631, p<0.00001) were observed, with no interactions among the factors evaluated \n\n(p>0.05). The use of the conventional dentifrice resulted in significantly higher fluoride levels \n\nin the biofilms than those obtained for the placebo (p = 0.005), regardless the time of sample \n\ncollection. However, no differences were observed between placebo and low-fluoride or \n\nbetween low-fluoride and conventional dentifrices. \n\nRegarding biofilm depth, fluoride concentrations were significantly higher in the 3 outer \n\nlayers when compared to the 7 deeper layers (Figure 1). Considering data arranged from the \n\nenamel surface, no significant differences were observed for the 4 inner layers (p>0.05). \n\nFor calcium concentrations, significant differences were verified among the layers \n\n(F=150.738, p<0.00001), with significant interactions between the factors biofilm depth, \n\ntreatments and time of sample collection (F=1.807, p=0.027). The four outer layers had \n\nsignificantly higher calcium concentrations when compared to the 6 inner layers (Figure 2). \n\nFor the second ANOVA (data arranged from enamel surface), as observed for fluoride, no \n\nsignificant differences were observed among the layers. \n\nA moderate correlation was found between fluoride and calcium concentrations in each \n\nsection of the biofilms collected. When combining all the 660 sections together (11 \n\nvolunteers, 10 outer sections, 3 treatments, 2 times after sample collection), the correlation \n\ncoefficient was r = 0.49 (p<0.001). Tables 1 and 2 show the individual coefficients of \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  37\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\ndetermination when isolating the factors and for the 10 outer sections of the biofilms, \n\nrespectively. \n\nFinally, data were also arranged considering each device as a whole unit (the sections were not \n\ntaken into account), allowing comparisons with previous studies conducted with a similar \n\nprotocol. The results from the 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant \n\ndifferences between treatments only (F=8.888, p=0.002); no difference was detected between \n\ntimes after sample collection (F=1.579, p=0.238), nor interactions between the two factors \n\nanalyzed (F=0.797, p=0.464). The values obtained for the placebo dentifrice were significantly \n\nlower when compared to the low-fluoride (p=0.04) and the conventional (p=0.002) dentifrices, \n\nbut no difference was verified between the fluoridated dentifrices (p=0.286). \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe study of fluoride distribution throughout plaque biofilms is important in elucidating the \n\ndiffusion and retention of fluoride and the interactions between plaque, saliva and the \n\nunderlying dental tissues (Robinson et al 1997,  Kato et al., 1997). To date, the most suitable \n\nmethod for studying the distribution of ions and other chemical agents (e.g. triclosan) within \n\nplaque is the Leeds in situ device. Due to the complex methodology involved, only 3 studies \n\nevaluating fluoride distribution in the biofilm have been reported, and all of them agreed that \n\nfluoride is mainly restricted to the outer layers of biofilm after exposure to a fluoridated \n\nsolution (Robinson et al., 1997, Kato et al., 1997, Watson et al., 2005).  \n\nFluoride distribution in sections of biofilms after the use of a fluoridated dentifrice had still \n\nnot been described, although it would be expected that a viscous vehicle might further limit \n\npenetration. This assumption was confirmed by the results of the present study. While fluoride \n\nwas restricted mainly to the outer layers of biofilms (Figure 1), the concentrations of the ion \n\nwere much lower than the reported in the above-mentioned studies. \n\nSome factors may explain the differences between the results obtained for fluoridated \n\nsolutions and dentifrices. First, the dentifrice\u2019s viscosity may reduce fluoride permeability into \n\nthe biofilm, since biomass density increases from plaque/saliva interface inwards and the \n\ndistribution of channels and voids decrease in this direction (Robinson et al., 2006). Moreover, \n\nstudies with non dental-biofilms demonstrated that solute transfer through channels is more \n\nrapid than transfer through dense biomass, because of lower diffusion resistance (Zhang and \n\nBishop, 1994). These studies together seem to explain the decrease in biofilm fluoride \n\nconcentration from plaque/saliva interface towards enamel after exposure to a fluoridated \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  38\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nsolution (Kato et al., 1997, Robinson et al., 1997, Watson et al., 2005). An additional possibility \n\nis that fluoride interacts with the surface of plaque biomass. Surface area/plaque biomass \n\nvolume decreases from salivary interface towards the enamel and mirrors fluoride distribution \n\n(Robinson and Watson 2005). Second, children washed their mouth after brushing with the \n\ndentifrice, which considerably reduces oral fluoride concentrations (Duckworth et al., 1991). \n\nThird, other components in the dentifrice composition, such Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS), \n\nmay compete with fluoride for calcium binding sites (Whitford, personal communication), \n\nbesides producing alterations in biofilm\u2019s structure. These would be induced either by removal \n\nof structural material (especially proteins) by the detergent, and by SLS binding to plaque \n\nconstituents, which would cause mutual repulsion of endogenous components, thus altering the \n\nstructure (Robinson et al., 2006). Fourth and last, samples were collected at least 1 h after \n\nexposure to the dentifrices, so no immediate analysis on fluoride distribution was carried out. \n\nCalculations on the fluoride diffusion coefficient in dental plaque illustrate that plaque \n\nthickness is an extremely important determinant of fluoride penetration. In plaque biofilms \n\n100 \u00b5m and 500 \u00b5m thick, exposure to a fluoridated solution for 20 min would deliver, \n\nrespectively, 91% and 0.14% of the applied fluoride concentration to the tooth surface beneath \n\nthe biofilm (Stewart, 2005). In the present study, biofilms were relatively thick (~ 850 \u00b5m), \n\nsimulating plaque biofilms at caries prone sites (Sissons et al., 1992; Dibdin, 1993). These \n\nbiofilms therefore are different from those obtained in the studies by Whitford et al. (2002, \n\n2005) and Pessan et al. (2008). Thus, when considering biofilm\u2019s thickness along with \n\ndentifrice\u2019s viscosity, mouth washing with water after brushing and dentifrice\u2019s composition \n\n(especially SLS), it is not surprising to observe that fluoride concentrations in deeper layers of \n\nbiofilms were not numerically different, regardless the dentifrice used.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that when each device was considered a whole unit, the fluoride \n\nconcentrations followed the same pattern observed for a previous study when whole plaque \n\nwas collected in vivo (Pessan, personal communication). However, this pattern was different \n\nwhen the biofilm\u2019s layers were considered separately. This may have been due to the fact that \n\nbiofilm samples in the in vivo study were collected from buccal and lingual surfaces, being \n\ntherefore much thinner than samples collected with the devices. Based on the diffusion \n\ncoefficients mentioned above (Stewart, 2005), and given that both studies followed the same \n\ntreatment protocol, fluoride diffusion into in vivo plaque possibly occurred in a higher \n\npercentage of plaque when compared to the thick biofilms generated using the Leeds in situ\n\ndevice. Additional studies should be conducted in order to evaluate fluoride distribution in \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 2  39\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nserial sections of plaque biofilms with a thickness compatible to biofilms formed in vivo in \n\norder that our hypothesis could be more precisely addressed.  \n\nPlaque fluoride and calcium concentrations have been demonstrated to be positive and \n\nsignificantly correlated in whole plaque biofilms (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005; Pessan et al., \n\n2006, 2008), suggesting that plaque fluoride and calcium concentrations are interdependent. \n\nOur data shows that fluoride and calcium distribution profiles through biofilm\u2019s depth were \n\nquite similar for all the dentifrices tested (Figures 1 and 2), supporting previous findings \n\nobtained in biofilms exposed to a fluoridated solution (Kato et al., 1997). In addition, these \n\nions are positively and significantly correlated when all data are combined, especially for \n\nsamples collected 1h after brushing (Table 1), and the coefficients of determination were \n\nsignificant for most layers when considered separately (Table 2).  These results support the \n\nview that fluoride is retained in plaque mainly through calcium-binding sites.  \n\nAs fluoride concentrations in the biofilm have been reported to be inversely associated with \n\ncaries increments and activity (Duckworth et al., 1992; Gaugler and Bruton, 1982), the \n\ndevelopment of new formulations able to penetrate fluoride into deeper layers of dental \n\nbiofilm is extremely desirable. Based on the premise that fluoride retention in plaque is \n\nmediated by calcium-binding sites, it is possible that increasing the availability of calcium in \n\nplaque would increase fluoride uptake. Rinses, dentifrices and chewing gums containing \n\ncalcium in different formulations and concentrations have been used for such purposes, but \n\nwith inconsistent results (Whitford et al., 2005, Vogel et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b, Pessan et \n\nal., 2006), so the hypothesis still remains to be proved. Other alternatives include dentifrices \n\nwith a reduced pH and with a lower viscosity. The use of a dentifrice containing 550 \u00b5g F/g, \n\nat pH 4.5 led to significantly higher fluoride concentrations in whole biofilm when compared \n\nto a conventional dentifrice (1,100 \u00b5g F/g, pH 7.0) (Buzalaf et al., 2009). In addition, the use \n\nof a liquid dentifrice promoted higher fluoride concentrations in whole biofilm when \n\ncompared to toothpastes, at same pH and fluoride concentrations (Buzalaf et al., 2009). For \n\nboth dentifrice\u2019s pH and consistency, however, the distribution of fluoride within biofilm \n\nlayers remains unclear. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThis investigation was supported by FAPESP (2005/03426-2 and 06/07258-0), CNPq \n\n(471395/2006-4), and CAPES (5143-06-3).

Plaque and plaque fluid fluoride concentrations associated to the use of conventional \n\nand low-fluoride dentifrices. Eur J Oral Sci.\n\nAbstract \n\nThere is evidence that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice (LFD) leads to a proportionally \n\nhigher plaque fluoride concentration ([F]) when compared to a conventional dentifrice (CD), \n\nbut no information is available on plaque fluid [F]. This double-blind, crossover study \n\nevaluated whole plaque and plaque fluid [F], as well as whole plaque calcium concentrations \n\n([Ca]) after brushing with a placebo dentifrice (PD), LFD and CD. Children (n=20) were \n\nrandomly assigned to brush twice daily with one of the dentifrices, during 7 days. Samples \n\nwere collected at 1 and 12 h after brushing. The use of the fluoridated dentifrices significantly \n\nincreased plaque [F]s 1 h after brushing when compared to PD. Plaque fluid [F]s were not \n\naffected by the [F] in the dentifrice, but were significantly higher 1 h after brushing; a similar \n\ntrend was observed for plaque [Ca]. Positive and significant correlations were found between \n\nplaque [F] and [Ca] under most of the conditions evaluated. The mean increase in plaque [F] \n\nobserved 1 h after brushing with the CD were about 47% higher than those obtained for the \n\nLFD, supporting the assumption that the use of a LFD promotes  proportionally higher \n\nincreases in plaque [F] when compared to a CD.  \n\nKey words: Fluoride, Calcium, Dental Plaque, Plaque fluid, Toothpaste \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  49\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nReprint requests:\n\nMar\u00edlia Afonso Rabelo Buzalaf \n\nAl.

Although the \n\ncontribution of fluoridated toothpastes on caries reduction is well documented in both \n\ndeveloped and developing countries, the use of these products has also been associated to an \n\nincrease in the prevalence of dental fluorosis (3), due to the ingestion of high amounts of \n\ndentifrice during toothbrushing, especially by young children (4). \n\nAmong the strategies to minimize fluoride intake from this source, the use of low-\n\nfluoride dentifrices has been recommended, although the evidences for the clinical efficacy of \n\nsuch formulations are still controversial when compared to dentifrices containing of 1,000-\n\n1,100 \u00b5g F/g. (5). Considering that dental caries is a plaque-dependent disease and that \n\ndemineralization of tooth structure will occur only on surfaces underneath dental plaque, the \n\namount of fluoride retained at this compartment is of paramount importance from a clinical \n\nperspective, since fluoride can be released from plaque during a cariogenic challenge, \n\ndelivering the ion to the plaque fluid and, therefore, to enamel under plaque (6). \n\nA recent study demonstrated that fluoride uptake by dental plaque at both 1 and 12 h \n\nwas not significantly different after the use of dentifrices containing 513 and 1,072 \u00b5g F, \n\nsuggesting that the use of the low-fluoride formulation is able to promote a proportionally \n\nhigher fluoride uptake when compared to the conventional dentifrice (Pessan et al., IADR \n\nMeeting, 2009). The bioavailability of fluoride in the plaque fluid under clinical conditions, \n\nhowever, is still now known. The only study described so far used an in situ protocol, with a \n\nmonospecific artificial test plaque, so the results cannot be directly extrapolated to in vivo\n\nconditions (7). \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  51\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nAs the plaque fluid is the site at which fluoride influences de- and remineralization \n\nprocesses, the aim of the present study was to assess fluoride uptake by dental plaque and \n\nplaque fluid, using the same protocol described by Pessan et al. (IADR Meeting, 2009). \n\nPlaque calcium concentrations were also evaluated, as it has been reported that plaque \n\nfluoride uptake is dependent on plaque calcium concentrations (8-10). \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nTwenty 8-10-year-old Brazilian children, residents in an optimally fluoridated \n\ncommunity (Bauru, 0.72 ppm F in the public water supply), participated. Sample size was \n\nestablished at 15 subjects per group in order to obtain a power of 80% (?=0.05), based on a \n\nstudy conducted with the same protocol (10). As inclusion criteria, children presented good \n\noral health status, were not using medicines during the experimental protocol and drank tap \n\nwater exclusively. The protocol was approved by the IRB of Bauru Dental School1 and \n\ninformed consent was obtained from children\u2019s parents2.  \n\nThe study began with a dental prophylaxis to remove all accessible plaque and \n\ncalculus. The protocol of the study, described in detail in previous publications (2,8-10), \n\nfollowed a double-blind, crossover design, in which the volunteers were randomly assigned \n\n(blocking stratification) to brush with a conventional fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg, \n\nProctor &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 \n\nmgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free placebo. The dentifrices\u2019 tubes were coded by a researcher not \n\ninvolved in the present study. They used these products for 1.0 min in the morning and at \n\nbedtime for one week and rinsed with 10 mL of water3. The abrasive system in the calcium-\n\nfree products was hydrated silica. \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n1 Anexos 4 a 6 \n2 Anexo 7 \n3 Anexo 8?\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  52\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nDuring the sixth day, children brushed only the occlusal surfaces to allow plaque \n\naccumulation. After going to bed, they refrained from eating or drinking anything except \n\nwater and did not brush their teeth until the following morning. On the following morning, \n\nplaque was collected from the right side of mouth; children then brushed the occlusal surfaces \n\nfor 1 min and rinsed with 10 mL of tap water. One hour later plaque (left side) was again \n\ncollected. Thus the samples were collected 1 h and approximately 12 h after the last use of the \n\ndentifrices. The entire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously used. \n\nPlaque samples were collected from all accessible surfaces using a Hollenback carver, \n\nimmediately transferred to plastic strips and then placed inside oil-filled centrifuge tubes (11). \n\nAfter determination of the sample weight (\u00b1 10 \u00b5g), the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min \n\n(14,000 rpm) at 4\u00b0C to separate the fluid from the plaque solids. The fluid was recovered with \n\noil-filled capillary micropipettes, which were used to transfer the fluid to the fluoride \n\nelectrode for analysis, as described below4. After fluid extraction, plaque solids were kept \n\nfrozen until the extraction of acid-soluble whole plaque F and Ca5. The tip of the centrifuge \n\ntube was cut (11), and the remaining plaque was centrifuged into a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge \n\ntube containing 0.5 M HCl (500 \u00b5L/10 mg of plaque, wet weight) (6). The samples were \n\nagitated by being rotated at 30 rpm for 3 h at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged. \n\nThe supernatant was collected and neutralized with 1 M NaOH (250 \u00b5L/10 mg of plaque, wet \n\nweight) and kept frozen until analyses. TISAB III (Thermo Orion, Beverly, Massachusetts, \n\nUnited States) was added (1:10) just before analysis. Fluoride analysis of all the samples was \n\ndone on the surface of an oil-covered inverted F electrode (9409, Thermo Orion, Beverly, \n\nMassachusetts, United States) with the use of a microscope and micro-reference electrode, \n\nheld in a micromanipulator, to close the circuit (11). Plaque fluid samples were diluted with \n\nTISAB III (1:10) on the surface of the F electrode by means of micropipettes (11). Calcium \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n4 Anexo 17 \n5 Anexo 18?\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  53\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nconcentrations were determined colorimetrically in triplicate at 650 nm (FLUOstar OPTIMA, \n\nBMG Labtech, Germany). Preparation of the samples for measuring calcium concentration \n\nwas conducted with the Arsenazo III method (6,12). For the analyses of total Ca in whole \n\nplaque, the standards also contained TISAB III.  \n\nData passed normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and homogeneity (Levene) tests and \n\nwere then analyzed by two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA. Tukey\u2019s test was used as the \n\npost hoc test for ANOVA. Pearson\u2019s correlation was used to verify the relationships between \n\nfluoride concentrations in whole plaque and plaque fluid, as well as between fluoride and \n\ncalcium concentrations in whole plaque. The significance level was set at 5%. \n\nResults \n\nTable 1 shows mean concentrations of fluoride in whole plaque and plaque fluid, as \n\nwell as calcium concentrations in whole plaque. A dose-response relationship could be \n\nobserved for mean whole plaque fluoride concentrations, when considering each time of \n\nsample collection separately. The values obtained at 12 h after brushing were 0.88, 1.09 and \n\n0.96 \u00b5mol/g and 1 h after brushing were 1.06, 1.64 and 1.96 \u00b5mol/g, respectively for the \n\nplacebo, 513 \u00b5g F/g and 1,030 \u00b5g F/g dentifrices. No significant differences, however, were \n\nobserved among the dentifrices (F=2.69, p=0.08). Significant differences were observed \n\nbetween times of sample collection (F=17.99, p<0.001), as well as for the interaction between \n\ntreatments and times of sample collection (F=3.37, p<0.05). \n\nPlaque fluid fluoride concentrations at 1 h after brushing were significantly higher \n\nthan the correspondent values for 12 h after brushing (F=19.72, p<0,001). No significant \n\ndifferences were observed among the dentifrices (F=0.22; p=0.81). For calcium \n\nconcentrations in whole plaque, a similar trend was observed, with significant differences \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  54\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nbetween times of sample collection (F=5.98, p<0.05) and no differences among the dentifrices \n\n(F=0.06; p=0.94). \n\nPlaque fluoride and calcium concentrations were positively and significantly \n\ncorrelated for most of the situations tested. The highest coefficients of determination were \n\nobserved for the low-fluoride (r=0.67, p=0,001) and conventional dentifrices (r=0.72, \n\np<0.0001), both at 1 h after brushing (Table 2). When all values were analyzed together, the \n\ncoefficient of determination was r=0.53 (p<0.0001). No relationship between plaque fluid and \n\nwhole plaque fluoride concentrations could be observed for any of the situations tested \n\nindividually. When all data were considered together, the coefficient of determination was \n\nr=0.27 (p=0.77). \n\nDiscussion \n\nThe study of the mineral composition of dental plaque is of great importance from a \n\nclinical perspective, since plaque fluoride concentrations are inversely related to caries \n\nincidence and activity (13,14), and directly related to the clinical efficacy of topical fluoride \n\nformulations (15). The results of the present study demonstrated that, in an area with \n\noptimally fluoridated water, plaque fluoride concentrations 1 h after brushing with a \n\nconventional or a low-fluoride dentifrice are not significantly differently from each other. In \n\naddition, the values obtained for the conventional dentifrice were only 47% higher than those \n\nobtained for the placebo dentifrice 1 h after brushing, confirming previous findings that the \n\nuse of the low-fluoride formulation leads to a proportionally higher plaque fluoride uptake \n\nwhen compared to a conventional dentifrice (Pessan et al., IADR Meeting, 2009). It is \n\nimportant to point out that the data reported by Pessan et al. (IADR Meeting, 2009) were \n\nobtained using a different method of fluoride analysis (HClO4 extraction, dry plaque) than the \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  55\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\none employed in the present study (HCl extraction, wet plaque under oil), which gives \n\nadditional credibility to the data obtained.   \n\nThe above-mentioned findings seem to be supported by a recent randomized clinical \n\ntrial, which concluded that the anticaries effect of a low-fluoride dentifrice was similar to the \n\nconventional dentifrice when used by caries-inactive, but not caries-active children, residents \n\nin an area with low-fluoride concentrations in the drinking water (16). Considering the \n\nsimilarity of the values obtained 1 h after brushing with both toothpastes in the present study \n\n(conducted in an optimally fluoridated area), it could suggested that the differences in the \n\nclinical performances of conventional and low-fluoride formulations seem to be smaller than \n\ncurrently believed (5). This would occur especially in an optimally fluoridated area, where \n\nintraoral fluoride reservoirs can be replenished at a higher frequency from water besides the \n\nuse of the fluoridated dentifrice. It must be emphasized, however, that the present protocol did \n\nnot evaluate fluoride concentrations immediately after toothbrushing. It is possible that the \n\nhigher fluoride levels in plaque shortly after exposure to a conventional toothpaste may have a \n\ngreat impact on the remineralization of early carious lesions in caries-active individuals, when \n\ncompared to the use of a low-fluoride formulation. Time-course studies could bring additional \n\ninformation on fluoride uptake and clearance from both the solid and fluid phases of plaque \n\nafter the use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices. Therefore, as concluded by Lima et \n\nal. (16), caries activity may be taken into account when recommending a low-fluoride \n\ndentifrice. \n\n The significant increases in plaque fluoride concentrations after the use of the \n\nfluoridated dentifrices were not reflected in the fluid phase of plaque (Table 1), what could be \n\nexplained by several factors, mainly the lag time between the brushing episode and the first \n\nplaque sample collection, along with considerations on oral fluoride clearance. However, the \n\npresent results are not in agreement with those described in a recent in situ study, which \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  56\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\ndemonstrated a clear dose-response relationship in plaque fluid fluoride concentrations 30 min \n\nafter exposure to conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices, as well as 45 min after plaque \n\nexposure to a sucrose solution (75 min after toothbrushing) (7). Although the study by Tenuta \n\net al. (7) provided additional information about plaque fluid fluoride concentrations after the \n\nuse of a low-fluoride dentifrice, some differences between their protocol and that used in the \n\npresent study must be addressed. In the study by Tenuta et al. (7), enamel blocks were pre-\n\ntreated with slurries of dentifrices for 5 minutes, the volunteers did not spit out the dentifrice\u2019s \n\nfoam after brushing, a monospecific artificial test plaque was used and the contact area with \n\nsaliva and plaque was too small when compared to plaque present in smooth surfaces (as in \n\nthe present study), what may have substantially reduced salivary clearance in their study. In \n\ncontrast, in the present report there was no pre-treatment of enamel surfaces, children spat the \n\nfoam out after brushing and rinsed their mouths with water, a natural plaque was assessed and \n\nthe contact area between plaque and saliva was substantially higher. Therefore, the limitations \n\nof the protocol used by Tenuta et al. (2009) do not allow a direct extrapolation of the results \n\nto in vivo conditions.  \n\nIt was noteworthy that plaque fluid fluoride concentrations observed at 1 h after \n\nbrushing were significantly higher than those obtained at 12 h, regardless the dentifrice used. \n\nInterestingly, a similar pattern was observed for whole plaque calcium concentrations (Table \n\n1), what has already been observed in previous studies using the same research protocol \n\n(2,10). Considering that all the dentifrices were silica-based (calcium-free), the only \n\nreasonable explanation seems to be the influence of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) on plaque \n\nstructure (Whitford et al., AADR Meeting, 2008). It was demonstrated that SLS is able to \n\nproduce alterations in plaque structure induced either by removal of structural material \n\n(especially proteins), and by SLS binding to plaque constituents, which would cause mutual \n\nrepulsion of endogenous components (17). It is reasonable to assume that the expansion in \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  57\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nplaque structure would increase the mobility of ions in plaque and, therefore, in its fluid \n\nphase, reason by which increases in both plaque fluid fluoride concentrations and in whole \n\nplaque calcium concentration were seen 1 h after brushing even for the placebo dentifrice. \n\nSuch hypothesis deserves to be further investigated, since it may have significant implications \n\non the fluoride uptake by dental plaque after the use of dentifrices. \n\nPlaque fluoride concentrations were positively and significantly correlated to plaque \n\ncalcium concentrations under most of the conditions of the study, confirming previous \n\nfindings that plaque fluoride concentrations are dependent on plaque calcium concentrations \n\n(2,8-10). As a completely plaque-free situation is impossible in a clinical situation, the \n\namount of fluoride retained in plaque may be determinant on the fate of the enamel beneath \n\nplaque, since fluoride can be released from this compartment during a cariogenic challenge, \n\ninfluencing on the remineralization process. Therefore, strategies to increase plaque fluoride \n\nconcentrations should be based on methods to increase the fraction of plaque Ca capable of \n\nreacting with and retaining F (2). \n\nThis is the first clinical study that evaluated plaque fluid fluoride concentrations after \n\nthe use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices. Although the results for the whole \n\nplaque confirm previous findings that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice promotes a \n\nproportionally higher plaque fluoride uptake 1 h after brushing when compared to a \n\nconventional dentifrice, such increases are not reflected in the plaque fluid. The reason for \n\nthis is possibly the establishment of an equilibrium between the fluoride in the oral fluids \n\n(saliva and plaque fluid), which are highly influenced by the salivary clearance. SLS also \n\nseems to influence plaque and plaque fluid fluoride concentrations, which deserves to be \n\nfurther investigated.  \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Cap\u00edtulo 3  58\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis investigation was supported by FAPESP (2005/03426-2 and 06/07258-0) and CNPq \n\n(471395/2006-4).

Top, bottom, and side margins should be one inch, with no indented \nparagraphs. Figures and tables should not exceed 8-1/2 x 11 inches. Both Macintosh (Framemaker, MacWrite, \nWord, WordPerfect, Works WP, or WriteNow) and IBM PC (DCA-RFT, FrameMaker, MultiMate, Office \nWriter, Text, Word for Windows, WordPerfect, WordStar, Works WP, or XYWrite) files will be accepted. \nManuscripts should be \"clean\", i.e., free of tabs and codes. Bold and italic type should appear exactly as they \nwill appear on the printed page. Italicize items that will appear in italics; this will include the genus and species \nof an organism, g (for gravitational force), Latin words and abbreviations (for example, e.g., i.e., in vitro, in vivo, \net al.), and journal names in the References section. Tabs should be used to separate columns within tables. Do \nnot use elaborate table formatting.  \n\nUse a standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial to avoid misrepresentation of your data on different \ncomputers that do not have the unusual or foreign language fonts.  \n\nTitle and Section Headings  \n\nBold type should be used for the title on page 1. Use upper- and lower-case letters. First-level headings, which \ninclude ABSTRACT, INTRODUCTION, MATERIALS &amp; METHODS, RESULTS, DISCUSSION, \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS, and REFERENCES should be bold type, all upper-case letters, as shown. Second-\nlevel subheads should be bold type, upper- and lower-case. Third-level subheads should be bold type, upper- and \nlower-case, with a paragraph indent. Any lower-ranked subheads should be italicized, and in upper- and lower-\ncase. Please type no more than 10 characters per inch. Authors are reminded to include their complete mailing \naddresses, telephone, FAX, and e-mail addresses, as available. Copies of \"in press\" and \"submitted\" manuscripts \nthat will provide essential information for the referees should also be enclosed.  \n\nA Few Words About Style  \n\nAuthors should remember that they are writing to communicate to often-uninformed readers. Here are a few \nsuggestions: Show a clear chronological progression and logic to the development of your ideas throughout the \nmanuscript and within paragraphs and sentences. Speak to the reader in a direct and straightforward voice. Tell \nthe reader your purpose, then provide background, data, and conclusions. You will make your point most \neffectively by illustrating with a well-chosen example, rather than providing an encyclopedic discourse. In each \nparagraph and sentence, stick to the subject. For example, if the subject is \"biophysical properties\", don't write \nsentences in that paragraph that change the subject to the names of cited contributors. Each sentence should \ncontain only one thought. Write short and simple sentences. Choose the best word so that you say what you \nmean. To make your information accessible to the widest possible audience, avoid jargon, acronyms, and \nneedless words. Before submission, contributors must review their manuscripts with (i) computer grammar and \nspelling tools/filters and (ii) a colleague who is expert in English language grammar and syntax. Manuscripts \nmay be returned without review or rejected on the basis of poor English or accepted standards of style. Check to \nensure that all listed references, figures, and tables are cited in the text and that all cited references, figures, and \ntables are presented in appropriate sections. The Editor reserves the right to make changes to improve the clarity \nof the text. All such changes will be subject to contributors' approval before publication.  \n\nRevised Manuscripts  \n\nAll revisions must be accompanied by a cover letter signed by all authors to the Editor. The letter must (i) detail \non a point-by-point basis the contributors' disposition of each of the referees' comments, and (ii) certify that all \ncontributors approve of the revised content and that the manuscript complies with stipulations 'i' through 'iv' in \n\"General Policy\". Responses to separate reviewers should be on separate pages. Also include a copy of the \nrevision with all changes highlighted.  \n\nRANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS  \n\nEffective January 2004, manuscripts reporting a randomized clinical trial should follow the CONSORT \nguidelines as published in the Annals of Internal Medicine (Ann Int Med 134:657-662, 2001). Click here to \ndownload the checklist. This completed checklist file should be uploaded as Supplemental Material.  \n\nThe Journal encourages authors to register their clinical trials in a public trials registry, and we ask authors of \nmanuscripts describing such studies to submit the name of the registry and the study registration number prior to \npublication. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors plans to consider clinical trials for \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  65\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\npublication only if they have been registered (see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1 - \nhttp://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/351/12/1250). The following registries meet these requirements: \nhttp://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov and http://controlled-trials.com/isrctn/submission/.  \n\nGENE DATA  \n\nPrior to submission, the Journal asks that novel gene sequences be deposited in a public database (GenBank, \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/submit.html, EMBL, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Submission/index.html, \nor DDBJ http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/sub-e.html), and the accession number provided to the JDR. Manuscript \nsubmissions including microarray data should (a) include the information recommended by the MIAME \nhttp://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html guidelines in their submission, and/or (b) identify the \nsubmission details for the experimental details to one of the publicly available databases (ArrayExpress \nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ or GEO http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  \n\nMANUSCRIPT COMPONENTS  \n\nThe components of a manuscript should be: 1) title page, 2) abstract, 3) introduction,4) materials and methods, 5) \nresults, 6) discussion, 7) acknowledgments, 8) references, 9) tables, and 10) figure legends. The complete \nmanuscript should be arranged in that order. Number all pages consecutively in the top right-hand corner, \nincluding the title page. Label figures clearly. Each figure label must indicate the number corresponding to the \ncitation in the text, an arrow indicating the top, and contributors' abbreviated names.  \n\n1) Title Page (page 1) \n\nType in bold type with only the first letters of the main words capitalized. The title should be brief (not to exceed \n60 characters) and illustrative of the key finding. Also type the contributors' initials and last names in upper- and \nlower-case letters. Use superscript numbers to relate contributors to different departments or institutions, or to \nindicate a change in address. For the corresponding author who will receive reprint requests, provide the full \npostal (including ZIP or Postal Code) and e-mail addresses, telephone and FAX numbers, as available. If the \ncorresponding author is not the first author, indicate by a number superscript, and use the phrase \"corresponding \nauthor\", and that individual's e-mail address. The following information must be included on the cover page: 1) a \nshort title (running head) of up to 45 characters; 2) three to five key words; 3) the number of words in the \nabstract; 4) the number of words in the abstract and the text (excluding tables, figure legends, acknowledgments, \nand cited references); 5) the number of tables and figures; and 6) the number of cited references. If applicable, \ninclude source footnotes on page 1 to indicate prior preliminary publication. For example, state that the work \nwas \"Based on a thesis submitted to the graduate faculty, Azimuth University, in partial fulfillment of the \nrequirements for the PhD degree\" or that a preliminary report was presented at, or published in... Report all \nsources of funding in a later section, \"Acknowledgments\".  \n\n2) Abstract (page 2) \n\nA self-standing summary of the text, this section should not exceed one typed page (about 150 words). Concisely \ndescribe the (i) background and rationale, (ii) hypothesis or study objective, (iii) design and key methods, (iv) \nessential results, and (v) conclusions. Avoid abbreviations. The abstract will be re-published separately by \ninformation retrieval services. \n\n3) Introduction (page 3) \n\nBriefly and clearly describe the background and rationale for the stated hypothesis to be tested or objective to be \nstudied. Sufficient detail must be provided to permit the interdisciplinary reader to evaluate the results without \nreview of earlier publications. Describe and cite only the most relevant earlier studies; avoid presentation of an \nexhaustive review of the field. Do not include a summary of the results presented in the manuscript.  \n\n4) Materials &amp; Methods \n\nTo provide sufficient technical information so that the experiments can be repeated, the (i) experimental or study \ndesign, (ii) specific procedures, and (iii) type of statistical analysis must be described clearly and carefully. Use \nsection subheadings in a logical order to title each category or method. Previously published methods should be \nnamed (e.g., \"ultrasonic treatment\" rather than mention of the cited contributors' names) and cited. New methods \nmust be described completely. Present the data that validate the new method. A method used for only part of one \nexperiment may be described briefly in the \"Results\" section, table footnote, or figure legend. Present descriptive \ninformation about large numbers of experimental reagents, microbes, test materials, primer sequences, in tabular \nform with a brief explanation in the text. Proprietary names and sources of supply of all commercial products \nmust be given in parentheses in the text (name and model of product, company, city, and state or country). \nReport generic names and terms wherever possible. For protocols involving the use of human subjects or \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  66\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nspecimens, indicate succinctly that subjects' rights have been protected by an appropriate institutional review \nboard and informed consent was granted. When laboratory animals are used, indicate the level of institutional \nreview and assurance that the protocol ensures humane practices.  \n\n5) Results  \n\nThis section serves only to introduce data in the (i) text, (ii) tables, and (iii) figures and to call attention to their \nsignificant parts. Report results concisely, using tables and figures to present important differences or similarities \nthat cannot otherwise be presented or summarized in the text. The rationale and design of experiments should be \nmade clear in the previous sections of the manuscript. Reserve subjective comments, interpretation, or reference \nto the previous literature for the \"DISCUSSION\". Number tables and figures in the order in which they are \ndescribed and cited in the text. All tabular data should identify and report (i) either standard deviation values or \nstandard errors of the means, (ii) the number of replicate determinations or human or animal subjects, and (iii) \nprobability values and name(s) of statistical test(s) for reported differences. Restrict presentation of photo- and \nelectron micrographs to those essential to the results. If essential to the results, color can be published at the \ndiscretion of the Editor. (The cost for color in reprints, however, must be borne by the author. For cost estimates, \ncontact the Central Office at               703-548-0066       , or FAX 703-548-1883, e-mail publications@iadr.org.)  \n\n6) Discussion  \n\nExplain and interpret the results with a scientifically critical view of the previously published work in the field. \nHighlight the advances made by the new data. Indicate the limitations of the findings. State the conclusions of \nthe report, and explain why they are merited by the data. This is the only proper section for subjective comments.  \n\n7) Acknowledgments \n\nRecognize individuals who provided assistance to the project. Report all sources of grant and other support for \nthe project or study, including funds received from contributors' institutions and commercial sources, and do not \nrefer to a study being only partially funded by the cited sources. Consultancies and funds paid directly to \ninvestigators must also be listed, with statements such as \"This investigation was supported in part by USPHS \nResearch Grant DE-0000-00 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes \nof Health, Bethesda, MD 20892\".  \n\n8) References (maximum, 35)  \n\nThis section will list all sources cited in the paper. Arrange the citations in alphabetical order by last name of the \nfirst author without numbering. When citing a reference in the text, provide attribution for the subject under \ndiscussion. For example, \"Cold fusion has been difficult to replicate (Williams and Jones, 1988), but some recent \nmodifications in experimental design (Jones et al., 1989) continue to stimulate new investigation.\" Avoid \"Jones \net al. (1989) found...\" or \"In a recent study, Jones (1990) found...\", which creates vague statements because the \nsubject is shifted from \"cold fusion\" to the names of the cited contributors. Use \"et al.\" (in italics) when the cited \nwork is by three or more contributors. When the cited work is by two contributors, use both surnames separated \nby \"and\". When citing multiple references by the same author(s) in the same year, use \"a\", \"b\", etc. (e.g., Jones, \n1980b). Multiple references should be listed in chronological order of publication, separated by semi-colons. \n\"Unpublished observations\" and \"personal communications\" may be inserted into and cited (in parentheses) in \nthe text with written permission from the correspondents, but are not to be used as references. Abbreviate journal \nnames according to the style used in Index Medicus. Other titles should be formatted with slight modifications of \nthe style used by the US National Library of Medicine in Index Medicus. Examples of reference citation formats \nare illustrated below. Avoid using abstracts as references. Data from abstracts should be referenced as \u201cpersonal \ncommunication\u201d or \u201cunpublished observations\u201d as appropriate. When citing a Web site, list the authors and title \nif known, then the URL and the date it was accessed (in parentheses). Include among the references papers \naccepted but not yet published; designate the journal and add \"(in press)\". Information from manuscripts \nsubmitted but not yet accepted should be cited in the text as \"unpublished observations\" (in parentheses). The \nreferences must be verified by the author(s) against the original documents and checked for correspondence \nbetween references cited in the text and listed in the \"References\" section.  \n\nExamples of correct forms of references are listed below. They are single-spaced here for illustration but should \nbe double-spaced in the manuscript.  \n\nARTICLES IN JOURNALS \n\n1.

In the order of mention in the text, number each table consecutively with Arabic \nnumerals in the heading. In the heading, follow the table number with a brief descriptive title, generally \nhighlighting the key result. Design tables to highlight key results and comparisons. Make every effort to make \nthe presentation of data clear, simple, and uncluttered. As column headings, use accurate descriptors instead of \nsymbols, acronyms, and abbreviations. To avoid overlong titles and cumbersome tables, use explanatory \nfootnotes whenever possible. In the table or title, indicate the order of footnotes with superscript a,b,c,d,e,f, ... If \nneeded in footnotes, cite the short form of references in parentheses. In tabular columns and the text, decimals \nless than unity must have the decimal point preceded by a zero. To ensure that the presentation is clear, report \nonly the number of significant digits appropriate to the sensitivity and discrimination of the measure and the \ndifferences to be illustrated. Column headings should be simple and clear so that tables will be understandable \nwithout consultation of the text. Generally, column headings identify dependent variables, while independent \nvariables are identified by row descriptors on the left. Tables will usually be printed either 3-1/4 or 7 inches \nwide.  \n\n10) Figures  \n\nFigures are illustrative materials, including photomicrographs, radiographs, charts, and graphs. When possible, \nan electronic copy of the figure should be provided on a diskette with the text of the manuscript. Digitized \nfigures must be certified by the contributors to be an accurate representation of the original data and not \nelectronically edited. Figures must be discussed thoroughly in the text. Black-and-white photographic prints, \nlaser-quality reproductions, and original drawings on opaque white paper are preferred. Color reproductions will \nbe published free at the discretion of the Editor. Authors wishing to pay to publish color figures should contact \nthe Publications Department at the Central Office, at               703-548-0066       , e-mail publications@iadr.org. \nPrices are listed on the Page Charge/Reprint Order Form. An original and two copies of each figure must be \nsubmitted. Each set should be placed in a protective folder, one labeled \"for printer\" and the other two \"for \nreview\". On the back of each figure, oriented upright, label with contributors' names and figure number (and \nletter) in sequence corresponding to its mention in the text. Figures will generally be printed column-width, 1-1/2 \ncolumns' width, or page-width. Extraneous material should be cropped out to ensure minimal reduction. If crop \nmarks are necessary, do not place them directly on the figure. Mount the figure on a sheet of paper and place the \ncrop marks on the paper. Photomicrographs must include a scale of the form |________|, clearly labeled with a \nconvenient unit of length, e.g., 50 m. Graphs should be labeled briefly and clearly at the abscissa and ordinate, \nincluding the units of measure. All figures must be labeled to allow for easy readability and visualization if \nreduced by 50% or more. If possible, determine the percentage reduction at which the figure will be reproduced \n(e.g., 3-1/4 or 7 inches wide). Print a copy at that percentage to see how all elements will be affected. Consider \nthat any line or rule thinner than 1/2 point may not reproduce. Patterns used in bar charts can become illegible, \nthus rendering useless any keys provided for graphs. Ideally, all figures should be provided at the optimum size \nfor publication. The title and other identification may appear in the legend.  \n\nLegends \nLegends for all figures, including charts and graphs, must be typed together on a separate page and should be \nunderstandable without reference to the text. Include a title highlighting the key result and a key for any symbols \nor abbreviations used in the figure.  \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  70\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nAUTHORITATIVE REFERENCES  \n\nThe Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged) will be used as the authority for \nspelling of non-medical terms. Where two plural forms are provided, the American English form will be used. \nFor anatomical nomenclature, Nomina Anatomica (5th ed.) and Dorland's Illustrated Dictionary will be \nconsidered authoritative.  \n\nNOMENCLATURE  \n\nAuthors should refer to the International System of Units (SI), D.T. Goldman and R.J. Bell, Eds., NBS Special \nPublication 330 (1981). This booklet is available from the US Dept. of Commerce, National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, Washington, DC 20234. Use of correct symbols includes m for milli-, for micro-, \nand L for liter (as in mL, L, etc.). Express grams as g, hours as hr, seconds as sec, and centrifugal force as g (e.g., \n10,000 g). Use nm rather than Angstroms. Concentrations should be expressed as mol/L or mmol/L, etc. Insert \nleading zeros in all numbers less than 1.0 in the text, tables, and figures. \n\nNumbers of ten and fewer should be written out (e.g., ten subjects), except when indicating inanimate quantities \n(e.g., 10 mL), and numbers that are greater than ten should appear as digits. Always use digits to express dates, \ndimensions, degrees, doses, periods of time, percentages, proportions, ratios, sums of money, statistical results, \nweights, and measures, or to enumerate animals (but not people), culture cells and organisms, organs, and teeth. \nLeave a space between numbers and their accompanying units (e.g., 10 mg, not 10mg), and around the = and \nsigns.  \nMicro-organisms should be referred to in accordance with the International Rules of Nomenclature. When \napplicable, the nomenclature for bacteria presented in Bergey's Manual of Systemic Bacteriology (current \nedition) will be followed. The first reference to an organism by genus and species must be in full (e.g., \nLactobacillus casei); subsequent mention may abbreviate genus (L. casei). When a common name of a bacterium \nor group is mentioned, do not italicize (e.g., \"some lactobacilli\" or \"sanguis group streptococci\"). \nAuthors of papers containing primary nucleotide sequencing data are expected to deposit this information in an \nappropriate database (e.g., GenBank/EMBL). Pertinent accession numbers should be provided with the \nsubmitted manuscript. Published articles will include a footnote indicating the accession number and database in \nwhich the information was deposited. \nFor examples of format not specified here, contributors should consult the Council of Biology Editors Style \nManual (current edition) and current issues of the Journal. \n\nThe complete names of individual teeth must be given in full in the text of articles (e.g., \"permanent upper right \nfirst premolar\"). In Tables, these names may be abbreviated by Viohl's Two-digit System. As approved by the \nInternational Standards Organization, the first digit indicates the quadrant and the second digit the type of tooth \nwithin the quadrant. Starting at the upper right side and rotating clockwise, quadrants are assigned the digits 1 to \n4 for the permanent and 5 to 8 for the deciduous teeth; within the same quadrant, teeth from the midline \nbackward are assigned the digits 1 to 8 (deciduous teeth, 1 to 5). For example, the permanent lower right first \nmolar is designated '46' and the deciduous upper left canine, '63'.  \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  71\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nANEXO 2: Comprovante de submiss\u00e3o ao peri\u00f3dico Journal of Dental Research \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  72\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nANEXO 3: Instru\u00e7\u00f5es aos autores \u2013 European Journal of Oral Sciences \n\nEuropean Journal of Oral Sciences \nOfficial publication of NOF - the Scandinavian Division of the International Association for Dental Research  \nEdited by: Anders Linde \nPrint ISSN:               0909-8836        \nOnline ISSN: 1600-0722 \nFrequency: Bi-monthly \nCurrent Volume: 117 / 2009  \nISI Journal Citation Reports\u00ae Ranking: 2007: 13/51 (Dentistry, Oral Surgery &amp; Medicine)  \nImpact Factor: 2.071  \n\n1. GENERAL  \nThe European Journal of Oral Sciences is an international non-profit journal which publishes original research \npapers within clinical dentistry, on all basic science aspects of structure, chemistry, developmental biology, \nphysiology and pathology of relevant tissues, as well as on microbiology, biomaterials, and the behavioral \nsciences as they relate to dentistry. In general, analytical studies with a scientific novelty value are preferred to \ndescriptive ones. Reviews, Focus Articles, Short Communications and Letters to the Editor will also be \nconsidered for publication. \nPlease read the instructions below carefully for details on the submission of manuscripts, the journal's \nrequirements and standards, as well as information concerning the procedure after a manuscript has been \naccepted for publication in the European Journal of Oral Sciences. Authors are encouraged to visit Blackwell \nPublishing Author Services for further information on the preparation and submission of articles and figures. \nIt is expected that all manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should follow journal \nformat as described in the Author Guidelines and as displayed in recent issues of the Journal. Failure to do so \nreflects negatively on the work itself and may be a cause for immediate rejection of a manuscript. \n\n2. ETHICAL GUIDELINES  \nThe European Journal of Oral Sciences adheres to the below ethical guidelines for publication and research. \n\n2.1. Authorship and Acknowledgements  \nAuthors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that the manuscript has been read and approved by all \nauthors, and that all authors agree to the submission of the manuscript to the Journal.  \nThe European Journal of Oral Sciences adheres to the definition of authorship set up by The International \nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). According to the ICMJE, authorship criteria should be based on \n1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of \ndata; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the \nversion to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2 and 3. \nIt is a requirement that all authors have been accredited as appropriate upon submission of the manuscript. \nContributors who do not qualify as authors should be mentioned in the Acknowledgements. \n\n2.2. Ethical Approvals \nExperimentation involving human subjects will only be published if such research has been conducted in full \naccordance with ethical principles, including the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the \nadditional requirements, if any, of the country where the research has been carried out. Manuscripts must be \naccompanied by a statement that the experiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of \neach subject and according to the above mentioned principles.  \nAnimal experiments should be carried out in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the National Institute \nof Health (NIH) in the USA regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures or with the \nEuropean Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and in accordance with local \nlaws and regulations. \nAll studies using human or animal subjects should include an explicit statement in the Material and Methods \nsection that the study has been independently reviewed and approved by an ethical board, identifying the review \nand ethics committee for each study. Editors reserve the right to reject papers if there is doubt as to whether \nappropriate procedures have been used.  \n\n2.3 Clinical Trials \nClinical trials should be reported using the CONSORT guidelines available at www.consort-statement.org. A \nCONSORT checklist should also be included in the submission material.  \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  73\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nThe European Journal of Oral Sciences encourages authors submitting manuscripts reporting from a clinical trial \nto register the trials in any of the following free public clinical trials registries: www.clinicaltrials.gov/, \nhttp://clinicaltrails-dev.ifpma.org/, http://isrctn.org/. The clinical trial registration number and name of the trial \nregister will then be published with the paper.  \n\n2.4 DNA Sequences and Materials Requests  \nIf a manuscript describes original nucleotide/amino acid sequence data, these should be submitted to GenBank \nby the authors and the accession numbers included in the manuscript. Authors of papers published in the Journal \nare obliged to honor any reasonable request by qualified investigators for unique propagative materials, such as \ncell lines, hybridomas, DNA clones and antibodies that are described in the paper. \n\n2.5 Conflict of Interest  \nAuthors are required to disclose any possible conflict of interest. These include financial issues (for example \npatent, ownership, stock ownership, consultancies, speaker's fee). Author's conflict of interest should be included \nunder Acknowledgements. \n\n2.6 Permissions \nIf all or parts of previously published illustrations are used, permission must be obtained from the copyright \nholder concerned. It is the author's responsibility to obtain these in writing and provide copies to the Publishers. \n\n2.7 Copyright Assignment  \nAuthors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that no part has been published before, that it is not being \nconsidered for publication elsewhere, and that it has been read and approved by all the authors. Fragmentation of \nresearch into 'least publishable units' is strongly discouraged.  \nIf closely related papers, published or not, might be considered as overlapping or duplicate publications, they \nshould be submitted with the original manuscript, and the authors should justify the originality of the newly \nsubmitted paper. \nThe submission of the manuscript by the authors means that the authors automatically agree to assign exclusive \ncopyright to Nordisk Odontologisk Forening in its capacity as owner of the journal if and when the manuscript is \naccepted for publication. The work shall not be published elsewhere in any language without the written consent \nof Blackwell Publishing. The articles published in this journal are protected by copyright, which covers \ntranslation rights and the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute all of the articles printed in the journal. \nUpon acceptance of a paper, authors are required to assign the exclusive licence to publish their paper to the \nEuropean Journal of Oral Sciences. Assignment of the exclusive licence is a condition of publication, and papers \nwill not be passed to the publisher for production unless license has been assigned. (Papers subject to \nGovernment or Crown copyright are exempt from this requirement; however, the form still has to be signed). A \ncompleted Exclusive License Form must be sent to the address specified on the Form, before any manuscript can \nbe published. Authors must send the completed original Exclusive License Form by mail upon receiving notice \nof manuscript acceptance. Do not send the Exclusive License Form at submission.  \nFor questions concerning copyright, please visit Blackwell Publishing's Copyright FAQ\n\n3.

Also, the e-mail should be received if the IT department adds our e-mail server \n(uranus.scholarone.com) to their whitelist.  \n\n3.6. Editorial Processing  \nAfter a first editorial screening, manuscripts will be forwarded to one of the Journal's Editors for further \nscientific evaluation and processing. Thus, queries and comments concerning a specific manuscript should \nprimarily be directed to the managing Editor. Manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences\nwill be reviewed by two or more experts in the field. The European Journal of Oral Sciences uses single blinded \nreview. The names of the reviewers will thus not be disclosed to the author submitting a paper. \n\n3.7. Manuscript Status  \nYou can access ScholarOne Manuscripts any time to check your \"Corresponding Author Center\" for the status of \nyour manuscript. The Journal will inform you by e-mail once a decision has been made. \n\n3.8. Submission of Revised Manuscripts  \nTo upload a revised manuscript, please locate your manuscript under \"Manuscripts with Decisions\" and click on \n\"Submit a Revision\".

Be sure to use the earlier manuscript number (which will then get an R addendum). \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  75\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nPlease remember to delete any old files uploaded when you upload your revised manuscript. Do not forget to \nsubmit an accompanying letter with itemized answers to all questions and remarks made by the reviewers and \nthe Editor. \n\n4. MANUSCRIPT TYPES ACCEPTED  \nOriginal Articles: An original article should comprise a conclusive, full-length scientific investigation. It should \ndescribe the rationale behind the study, the materials and methods used, and the results obtained. There should \nalso be a discussion of the implications of the results as well as a list of literature references cited.  \nScientific studies investigate phenomena and acquire new knowledge - or correct or integrate previous \nknowledge. They are based on the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and subject to \nspecific principles of reasoning. The European Journal of Oral Sciences gives priority to analytical articles, \ninvestigating why and how something occurred rather than reporting empirical observations. \nReview Articles: May be invited by the Editors. Proposals for such articles should be discussed with the \nappropriate Editor prior to preparation and submission. Review articles comprise attempts to synthesize the \nexisting literature pertaining to a specific scientific question using methods and principles of reasoning that are \nas transparent as possible. It follows that systematic reviews are preferred over more narrative reviews. Review \narticles will be subjected to peer review. \nFocus Articles: May be invited by the Editors. Proposals for such articles should be discussed with the \nappropriate Editor prior to preparation and submission. Focus articles may build on the same principles as the \nReview article, but are usually shorter and aim at stimulating a broader scientific discussion by 'contesting \nconventional wisdom' and allowing the author(s) to argue a specific point pertaining to a matter of current \nscientific importance. Focus articles will be subjected to peer review. \nShort Communications: Short communications should aim at being no longer than two printed pages. They \nshould contain important, new, definitive information of sufficient significance to warrant publication. Short \ncommunications need not follow the usual division into Material and methods etc. but should have a short \nAbstract. \nExtra issues: Congress proceedings, larger papers or monographs may be published as Supplements or Part II \nissues, the full cost being paid by the congress organizer or similar. A condition is that the proposed extra issue \nis deemed to have a significant scientific value. In some cases, the Journal will partly fund extra issues; this is at \nthe discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. Further information may be obtained from the Editor-in-Chief.  \n\n5. MANUSCRIPT FORMAT AND STRUCTURE  \nIt is expected that all manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should follow journal \nformat as described in the Author Guidelines and as displayed in recent issues of the Journal. Failure to do so \nreflects negatively on the work itself and may be a cause for immediate revision or even rejection of a \nmanuscript. \n\n5.1. Format  \nLanguage: The language of publication is English. Authors whose native language is not English are strongly \nadvised to obtain assistance from someone proficient in scientific English. Manuscripts not submitted in the \nproper format or in poor English may be returned without review. A list of independent suppliers of editing \nservices can be found at www.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/english_language.asp. All services are paid for \nand arranged by the author, and use of one of these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for \npublication.  \n\nAbbreviations, Symbols and Nomenclature: Correct unit abbreviations should be used. Examples include ''yr'', \n''wk'', ''d'', ''h'', ''min'', ''s'' and ''\u00b5m'' rather than ''years'', ''weeks'', ''days'', ''hrs'', ''minutes'', ''sec'' and ''\u00b5'', \nrespectively. For abbreviations of physical and chemical units and symbols, designation of isotopically labelled \ncompounds, abbreviations which may be used without definition etc., the Biochemical Journal web site is a \nvaluable resource. Scientific names of bacteria, binomials in italics, must be given in full when first mentioned. \nSubsequent mention may abbreviate genus, taking care that this abbreviation is unambiguous (Staph. or Strep. \ninstead of S.). \n\n5.2. Structure  \nAll manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should include: Title page, Abstract Page, \nIntroduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, \nTables, and Figures, arranged in that order.  \nAuthors are urged to consult a recent issue of the Journal to be familiar with style and format. The whole \nmanuscript should be double-spaced, paginated, and submitted in correct English. The beginning of paragraphs \nshould be properly marked with an indent. Avoid end-of-line hyphens.  \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  76\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nTitle Page: The title page should contain the following information in the order given: 1) the article title; 2) \nauthors' full names without degrees or titles; 3) authors' institutional affiliations including city and country; 4) a \nrunning title, not exceeding 40 letters and spaces; 5) name, address, telephone, telefax and e-mail address of the \nauthor responsible for correspondence. The title should be concise but informative, include animal species used \n(if appropriate) and should not include any non-standard acronyms or abbreviations. The Journal does not favour \ntitles of an affirmative character. \nAbstract: A separate abstract page should contain the following: 1) authors' surnames and initials; 2) title of \nmanuscript; 3) the abbreviation Eur J Oral Sci; 4) the word Abstract followed by a summary of the complete \nmanuscript; 5) up to five key words according to Index Medicus; 6) name, address, telefax and e-mail address of \nthe author to whom requests for reprints should be sent. This contact information should refer to a professional \nrather than to a residential/private address. \nThe Abstract should give a condensed overview of the study, summarizing its background, aim, methodology \nand results with only few but relevant details, and the authors' principal conclusions. It should be short and \nconcise, without headings and not divided into paragraphs, and with a maximum of 200 words. It should not \ncontain any non-standard acronyms or abbreviations.\n\n5.3 Main Text of Original Articles  \nMaterial and Methods: Procedures should be described in such a detail as to make it possible to repeat the \nwork. Subheadings may be used to improve clarity.  \nIt is assumed that authors have considered the ethical aspects of their research and ensured that the work was \napproved by an appropriate Ethical Committee. This should be stated. In human experimentation, informed \nconsent from individuals must have been given. (See above under 2.2) \nSources of supply of commercial products should be given with the address (town, state and country) in \nparenthesis. \nFor an improved quality and transparency, reports of randomized trials must conform to the CONSORT \nguidelines and will be evaluated in light of the recommendations in this statement. (See above under 2.3) \nSince many investigations rely on statistical treatment, authors are advised to consult a person with in-depth \nstatistical knowledge. \nIf a manuscript describes original nucleotide/amino acid sequence data, these should be submitted to GenBank \nby the authors and the accession numbers included in the manuscript. (See above under 2.4) \nAuthors of papers published in the Journal are obliged to honor any reasonable request by qualified investigators \nfor unique propagative materials, such as cell lines, hybridomas, DNA clones and antibodies that are described in \nthe paper. \nResults and Discussion: The Results section should clearly and concisely report findings, as a rule in the past \ntense, without subjective comments and reference to previous literature. Double documentation of data in text, \ntables or figures is not acceptable. Tables/figures should not include data that can be given in the text in one or \ntwo sentences. The Discussion section presents the interpretation of the findings; this is the only proper section \nfor subjective comments. Authors are strongly urged to avoid undue repetition of what has already been reported \nin Results. For the sake of clarity, the Results section may have subheadings; this is usually not the case with the \nDiscussion.  \nAcknowledgements: Under acknowledgements please specify contributors to the article other than the authors \naccredited. This may include recognition of e.g. financial support, gifts of research material, assistance with \nstatistics and language. Please also include specifications of any potential conflict of interests if appropriate.  \nShort Communications need not follow the usual division into Material and methods etc. but should have a \nshort abstract. \nReview and Focus Articles should include a Title page, an Abstract page and a Reference list as regular \nOriginal Research Articles. Although a Review article (particularly following a systematic review) may adhere \nto the format of the Original Research Article, Review and Focus articles need not contain Materials and \nMethods, Results or Discussion sections, and may instead employ other headings as relevant for the topic \naddressed. \n\n5.4. References \nNumber references consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text. Identify references in \ntexts, tables, and legends by Arabic numerals (within parenthesis). Check to ensure that all listed references are \ncited in the text. If an author's name is mentioned in the text, small capital letters should be used.\nNon-refereed material and, if possible, non-English publications should be avoided. Congress abstracts, \nunaccepted papers, unpublished observations, and personal communications may not be placed in the Reference \nlist. References to 'unpublished findings' and to 'personal communication' (provided explicit consent has been \ngiven by the sources) may be inserted in parentheses in the text. Unpublished articles should be referred to only \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  77\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nif proof can be given that they are accepted for publication.

Tables, Figures and Figure Legends \n\nTables: Tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals. Each table should include a \ncompulsory, concise explanatory title and an explanatory legend. A table should be organized with due regard \nfor the proportion of the printed column/page. Specifically, tables which are too wide must be avoided, as these \nhave to be printed vertically.  \n\nFigure Legends: Include Figure Legends after the reference section of the Main Text.  \n\nFigures: Articles will not be published unless the Figures fulfill journal quality criteria in terms of scientific \ninformation, general style, legibility of text and numbers, as well as electronic format and resolution. Double \ndocumentation of data in text, tables or figures is not acceptable. Always consider whether data might be better \ngiven in the text or in a table. All graphs, drawings, and photographs are considered Figures and should be \nnumbered in sequence with Arabic numerals. Each figure should have a legend (number and list legends after the \nreference section of the main text). Figures should be planned to fit the proportions of the printed page or one \ncolumn's width. Authors are encouraged to arrange micrographs into multipanel montages. Magnifications \nshould be indicated by scale bars. Text on photographs should be in capitals. To provide appreciable diagrams, \nlettering should be kept to a minimum and be large enough to sustain reduction in printing. Unnecessary colour, \ngrey shades and 3D character should be avoided in graphs.  \n\nPreparation of Electronic Figures for Publication: Print publication requires high quality images to prevent \nthe final product being blurred or unclear. Submit EPS (line art), TIFF (halftone/photographs) or PDF (line \nart/photographs) files only. MS PowerPoint and images embedded in MS Word files are not acceptable for \nreproduction. Halftone images in colour or greyscale (TIFF only) should have a resolution of 300 dpi in relation \nto the reproduction size (see below), while line drawings should have a resolution of 600 to 1200 dpi. EPS files \nshould be saved with fonts embedded (and with a TIFF preview if possible). For scanned images, the scanning \nresolution (at final image size) should be as follows: line art: >600 dpi; half-tones (including gel photographs): \n>300 dpi; figures containing both halftone and line images: >600 dpi. \nFurther information can be obtained at Blackwell Publishing's guidelines for figures: \nwww.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/illustration.asp\nYou can check here whether your electronic artwork fulfill criteria before submitting it: \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  78\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nwww.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/eachecklist.asp\n\nPermissions: If all or parts of previously published illustrations are used, permission must be obtained from the \ncopyright holder concerned.

A hidroquinona, presente no metil e butil metacrilato como estabilizador, foi removida por extra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom \u00e1gua. Para tanto, volumes iguais de metacrilato e NaOH 2,5 M foram colocados em um funil de \n\nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo a mistura agitada vigorosamente por 2 minutos e, sem seguida, mantidos em repouso, \n\npermitindo a separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases. A fra\u00e7\u00e3o inferior (aquosa) foi descartada e o sobrenadante \n\n(metacrilato), retido. Para ambos metil e butil metacrilato, o procedimento de extra\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizado 2 \n\nvezes. \n\nii. A \u00e1gua foi removida do metil e butil metacrilato, adicionando-se excesso de CaCl2 (anidro) ao \n\nmetacrilato. Com base no produto de solubilidade do CaCl2 anidro a 0 \u00baC (36,7%), considerou-se \n\ncomo excesso 40 g de CaCl2 para cada 100 mL de metacrilato. A suspens\u00e3o foi agitada vigorosamente \n\npor 2 minutos. Ap\u00f3s armazenamento overnight a -20 \u00baC, as suspens\u00f5es foram filtradas 2 vezes (Filtro \n\nn\u00ba1, Whatman, 0,2 \u00b5m de poro). Os filtrados resultantes foram decantados em frascos previamente \n\nsecos. Estes reagentes foram armazenados a -20 \u00baC, at\u00e9 requeridos para uso. \n\niii. A mistura de metacrilato foi completada pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de per\u00f3xido de benzo\u00edla. Ap\u00f3s atingirem \n\ntemperatura ambiente, o butil metacrilato e o metil metacrilato foram misturados em uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde 75:24. A esta mistura, foi adicionado per\u00f3xido de benzo\u00edla, a uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 1% \n\n(peso/volume). Esta mistura final foi aquecida at\u00e9 se tornar transparente, armazenada em frascos de \n\nvidro de 2 mL e ent\u00e3o armazenada a -20 \u00baC at\u00e9 requerida para uso. \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  89\n?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nANEXO 14: Embebi\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u201cDispositivos in situ de Leeds\u201d em metacrilato \n\na.
