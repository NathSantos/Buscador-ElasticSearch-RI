In Portugal there are two subspe-\n\ncies described, S. s. gallaica with a northern and central distribution and S. s crespoi with a \n\nmore restricted distribution in the south. \n\nDefining the geographical boundaries between populations and subspecies is frequent-\n\nly difficult because there are often uncertainties on their distribution limits at putative or \n\nproven contact areas. One approach being increasingly used to detect cryptic geographic \n\nboundaries between populations is landscape genetics. This is an emerging field that inte-\n\ngrates population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics and it aims to provide in-\n\nformation about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes. \n\n      I attempted here to determine the geographic distribution and limits of the two aforemen-\n\ntioned subspecies at their putative contact zone in southwest Portugal, using data from mi-\n\ncrosatellites and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b analysed with landscape genetics tools. \n\nThis approach allowed evaluating if the two subspecies are currently in allopatry and the oc-\n\ncurrence of gene flow between them. \n\n       Results show that the two subspecies are separated by a narrow barrier that contains the \n\nSado River and imposes a very reduced gene flow, both contemporarily and historically, be-\n\ntween them. Currently, the most important feature of this barrier seems to be the area of \n\nsandy soil south of the Sado that was part of the riverbed of an extended river in historical \n\ntimes. Although both populations show signs that they have been large for some time, S. s. \n\ncrespoi seems to have undergone a population expansion around 18,000 years BP. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Amphibian, Salamandra salamandra, Subspecies, Southwest Portugal, \n\nLandscape Genetics, Mitocondrial DNA, Microsatellites, Bayesian Inferance  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nResumo \n\nA Salamandra salamandra ou Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas \u00e9 um urodelo \n\npertencente \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Salamandridae, com h\u00e1bitos nocturnos, sedent\u00e1rios e totalmente \n\nterrestres, procurando meios aqu\u00e1ticos apenas para se reproduzir. A esp\u00e9cie apresenta uma \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o restrita no territ\u00f3rio europeu, ocorrendo nas regi\u00f5es do centro e sul da Europa e \n\nrareando a norte e leste. \u00c9 uma esp\u00e9cie altamente vari\u00e1vel, do ponto de vista gen\u00e9tico, \n\nmorfol\u00f3gico,  colora\u00e7\u00e3o e modo de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. Est\u00e3o descritas pelo menos 14 subesp\u00e9cies das \n\nquais 10 ocorrem na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica ilustrando a import\u00e2ncia desta regi\u00e3o como ref\u00fagio \n\ndurante os per\u00edodos glaciares. A Peninsula Ib\u00e9rica actuou como um dos ref\u00fagios glaciares mais \n\nimportantes da Europa. V\u00e1rias evid\u00eancias gen\u00e9ticas mostraram uma recente subdivis\u00e3o deste \n\nem v\u00e1rios pequenos ref\u00fagios, uma vez que diferentes esp\u00e9cies apresentam forte subestrutura \n\ngen\u00e9tica coincidindo com os diferentes ref\u00fagios da Peninsula Ib\u00e9rica.  \n\nSteinfartz et al. (2000) utilizou a regi\u00e3o controlo do ADN mitocondrial para analisar a \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es europeias. Este estudo identificou tr\u00eas linhagens: a \n\nlinhagem A, correspondendo \u00e0s subesp\u00e9cies S. s. longirostris, S. s crespoi e S. s. morenica, que \n\nser\u00e1 mais basal e ter\u00e1 divergido h\u00e1 cerca de 2 a 4 milh\u00f5es de anos das restantes linhagens. A \n\nlinhagem B, com popula\u00e7\u00f5es do norte de Espanha (S. s. bernardezi) e do sul de It\u00e1lia (S. s. \n\ngigliolii) que sugerem que esta linhagem ter\u00e1 tido uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o mais ampla no passado, e a \n\nlinhagem C constitu\u00edda por uma politomia n\u00e3o resolvida das restantes subesp\u00e9cies.  \n\nPorteriormente Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. (2003) utilizou o gene citocromo-b do ADN \n\nmitocondrial, para estudar as zonas de contacto entre subesp\u00e9cies na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica com \n\n\u00eanfase nas zonas de presen\u00e7a de popula\u00e7\u00f5es ovoviv\u00edparas e viv\u00edparas . Apesar de terem sido \n\nutilizadas poucas amostras das subesp\u00e9cies portuguesas, os resultados deste estudo \n\ncorroboraram a exist\u00eancia de diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o entre as subesp\u00e9cies S. s. crespoi e S. s. gallaica.  \n\nEm Portugal est\u00e3o descritas duas subesp\u00e9cies,  S. s. gallaica Seone, 1884 e  S. s crespoi \n\nMalkamus, 1983. A primeira apresenta uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o ampla por todo o norte e centro do \n\npa\u00eds correspondendo \u00e0 linhagem mais recente identificada em Steinfartz et al. (2000), \n\nenquanto S. s. crespoi tem distribui\u00e7\u00e3o consideravelmente mais restrita, sendo um endemismo \n\ndo Sudoeste de Portugal e \u00e9 representativa da linhagem mais ancestral.  \n\nOs limites das \u00e1reas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das diferentes subesp\u00e9cies de S. salamandra s\u00e3o \n\nincertos salientando a necessidade de estudos detalhados a uma escala local para averiguar \n\nlimites geogr\u00e1ficos entre subespecies. Um estudo realizado para avaliar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de uma \n\nsubesp\u00e9cie de Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas no centro de Espanha  detectou eventos \n\n\n\n \n \n\nrecentes de contacto secund\u00e1rio com outras subesp\u00e9cies. O delineamento de limites \n\ngeogr\u00e1ficos em popula\u00e7\u00f5es e subesp\u00e9cies \u00e9 frequentemente dif\u00edcil n\u00e3o s\u00f3 devido  ao problema \n\nda defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos limites das esp\u00e9cies mas tamb\u00e9m por n\u00e3o se conhecerem as fronteiras \n\ngeogr\u00e1ficas das mesmas. A detec\u00e7\u00e3o de limites gen\u00e9ticos em esp\u00e9cies com distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncont\u00ednua e onde popula\u00e7\u00f5es discretas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o f\u00e1cilmente definidas pode contribuir para a \n\ncompreens\u00e3o dos processos que determinaram a sua actual distribui\u00e7\u00e3o , como por exemplo a \n\nexist\u00eancia  de barreiras ao fluxo gen\u00e9tico. A gen\u00e9tica da paisagem tem, recentemente, sido \n\nutilizada para a detec\u00e7\u00e3o de barreiras geogr\u00e1ficas entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es com distribui\u00e7\u00e3o continua.  \n\nEsta disciplina \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o emergente que integra fundamentos da gen\u00e9tica \n\npopulacional, ecologia da paisagem, e estat\u00edstica espacial na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do efeito das vari\u00e1veis \n\nda paisagem e ambientais na diversidade gen\u00e9tica e estrutura populacional. \n\nForam utilizados tr\u00eas m\u00e9todos baseados em infer\u00eancia bayesiana, correntemente \n\nutilizados em gen\u00e9tica da paisagem, para identificar o limite da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica das \n\nduas subesp\u00e9cies de salamandra na zona de contacto do Sudoeste de Portugal (S. s. gallaica e \n\nS. S. crespoi) atrav\u00e9s do uso de 10 microssatelites j\u00e1 descrito para a esp\u00e9cies.  Os resultados \n\nmostraram a separa\u00e7\u00e3o das duas subesp\u00e9cies por uma barreira com cerca de 20km de \n\nextens\u00e3o que integra o rio Sado e uma \u00e1rea envolvente predominantemente constitu\u00edda por \n\nareias, arenitos e as argilas. Este resultado tamb\u00e9m foi corroborado  utilizando como marcador \n\nmolecular um fragmento do gene mitocondrial citocromo-b. Por\u00e9m, para este marcador foi \n\nutilizado um menor n\u00famero de amostras, que foram consideradas representativas da \n\namostragem total utilizada para os microssatelites, minimizando a redund\u00e2ncia de se \n\nutilizarem  amostras de locais pr\u00f3ximos. A rede de hapl\u00f3tipos mostrou dois grupos de \n\nhapl\u00f3tipos distintos para a subesp\u00e9cie S. s. gallaica na \u00e1rea amostrada  \n\nApesar de alguns problemas obtidos com os loci de microssat\u00e9lites utilizados (alelos \n\nnulos, desvios ao equilibrio de Hardy-Weinberg), foi possivel avaliar a ocorr\u00eancia de fluxo \n\ngen\u00e9tico entre ambas as subesp\u00e9cies. Com base nos resultados dos dois marcadores e de \n\nv\u00e1rios programas que avaliam o fluxo gen\u00e9tico e identificam indiv\u00edduos migrantes, foi poss\u00edvel \n\nverificar que actualmente o fluxo entre ambas as subespecies \u00e9 muito baixo.O fluxo gen\u00e9tico \n\nreduzido no passado (detectados 3 migrantes pela an\u00e1lise ADN mitocondrial), parece \n\npermanecer actualmente (detectados 8 migrantes pelos microssatelites), o que sugere a \n\nexist\u00eancia de uma barreira forte e persistente na passagem de migrantes entre as duas \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nDentro de cada subesp\u00e9cie apenas foi detectada uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o. Com o auxilio dos \n\ndois tipos de marcadores moleculares foi poss\u00edvel averiguar que ambas as popula\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam \n\n\n\n \n \n\napresentado ao longo do tempo um elevado efectivo. Contudo, ter\u00e1 ocorrido uma expans\u00e3o \n\nrecente em S. s. crespoi iniciada \u00e0 cerca de 18,000 anos atr\u00e1s. Esta data \u00e9 coincidente com o \n\n\u00faltimo m\u00e1ximo glacial sugerindo que ap\u00f3s este per\u00edodo a popula\u00e7\u00e3o de S. s. crespoi ter\u00e1 \n\nexpandido a partir de um refugio no sul. \n\nOs v\u00e1rios m\u00e9todos utilizados para estimar o tempo de diverg\u00eancia das duas \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es sugerem que a separa\u00e7\u00e3o ocorreu no Pleistoc\u00e9nico. O m\u00e9todo mais sofisticado, \n\nque considera qualquer sinal de fluxo gen\u00e9tico durante a data\u00e7\u00e3o de uma  separa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npopulacional, sugere uma estimativa mais recente de aproximadamente \u00e0 210,000 anos. \n\nEvid\u00eancias sugerem este per\u00edodo como quente e h\u00famido, em que ter\u00e1 ocorrido expans\u00e3o de \n\nflorestas de Quercus no sudoeste da Ib\u00e9ria. Para al\u00e9m de na Europa ter ocorrido um  per\u00edodo \n\nsemelhante por volta dos 120,000 de anos atr\u00e1s, apenas no presente o clima nesta regi\u00e3o  \u00e9 \n\nt\u00e3o favor\u00e1vel para a esp\u00e9cie. Um per\u00edodo quente e h\u00famido poder\u00e1 ter originado uma \n\nexpans\u00e3o da rede hidrgr\u00e1fica do  Sado juntamente  e de habitat florestal, facilitado a \n\nocorr\u00eancia de um um maior fluxo gen\u00e9tico, que n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 voltado a repetir-se desde ent\u00e3o.  \n\nAssim, com uma abordagem utilizada em gen\u00e9tica da paisagem mostrou-se que no \n\nSudoeste de Portugal as subesp\u00e9cies de Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas est\u00e3o separadas por \n\numa barreira que integra o rio Sado e uma \u00e1rea envolvente predominantemente constitu\u00edda \n\npor areias e arenitos. Para al\u00e9m disso, h\u00e1 evid\u00eancias de um  fluxo gen\u00e9tico hist\u00f3rico e actual \n\nmuito reduzido, tendo ocorrido um \u00faltimo per\u00edodo de contacto \u00e0cerca de  210,000 anos. Os \n\nresultados tamb\u00e9m evidenciam  que a subesp\u00e9cie end\u00e9mica do sudoeste de Portugal ter\u00e1 \n\niniciado uma expans\u00e3o \u00e0cerca de  18,000, ap\u00f3s o \u00faltimo m\u00e1ximo glaciar.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave: Anf\u00edbios, Salamandra salamandra, Subesp\u00e9cies, Sudoeste de Portugal, \n\nGen\u00e9tica da Paisagem, ADN mitocondrial, Microssat\u00e9lites, Infer\u00eancia Bayesiana \n\n\n\n \n \n\nAgradecimentos \n\nEm primeiro lugar gostaria de agradecer ao meu orientador Carlos Fernandes que \n\naceitou orientar-me durante este ano.

This species is mainly nocturnal, sedentary \n\nand completely terrestrial when adult, only search water bodies for reproduction. Live expec-\n\ntancy can reach up to 25 years in the wild, and reproduction typically starts after the fourth \n\nyear (Rebelo &amp; Caetano 1995). Salamanders are active after September until the end of April, \n\nhaving an annual activity period of roughly seven months split in two periods: the autumn \n\nrains of October/November and the late winter/early spring rains of February/March (Rebelo \n\n&amp; Leclair 2003). Concerning environmental conditions, the species is markedly dependent of \n\nhigh relative humidity, absence of wind, and nocturnal temperatures between 4\u00baC and 14 \u00baC \n\n(Rebelo 2008). Salamanders find these conditions in temperate deciduous forests, although \n\nthey may occur in a large variety of habitat types. The species\u2019 habitats range from subalpine \n\nmeadows to Mediterranean scrubland, and even in areas of steppe when these occur close to \n\nwater-courses with shrub cover. Salamanders are very effectively protected against predation \n\nsince they produce a toxin in their parotid glands that repels predators, with the coloured por-\n\ntions of the salamander\u2019s skin being considered a warning signal to their toxicity (Rebelo \n\n2008). \n\nSalamandra salamandra is a species with a wide distribution and high morphological \n\nvariability. Consequently, several different subspecies were described across different geo-\n\ngraphic regions. The species was historically considered to constitute a polytypic species as-\n\nsemblage with 16 subspecies, distributed over three continents, based on the distinctive mor-\n\nphology (Eiselt 1958; Klewen 1991). However, Steinfartz et al. (2000) were able to show, using \n\ngenetic markers, that it was possible to separate the genus Salamandra in six different species \n\nas supported by previous studies (Joger &amp; Steinfartz 1994; Veith 1994), corresponding to S. \n\nsalamandra, S. algira, S. infraimmaculata, S. corsica, and the previously considered S. atra and \n\nS. lanzai, each with their associated subspecies. Hence, the 16 subspecies previously consid-\n\nered within the S. salamandra complex are presently classified in 13 subspecies. The study by \n\nSteinfartz et al. (2000) suggests the presence of three main lineages within S. salamandra: (A) \n\nthe most ancient, comprising the subspecies S. s longirostris, S. s. morenica and S. s. crespoi, \n\nthat comes out as a reasonably well separated unit from the remaining lineages at about 2 to 4 \n\nmillion years ago; (B) a second lineage, including populations from northern Spain (S. s. ber-\n\nnardezi) and populations from southern Italy (S. s. gigliolii), inferred to represent the remnant \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nof a formerly widespread lineage that covered the whole of Central Europe in a previous inter-\n\nglacial period, approximately 500 000 years ago; and (C) a more derived lineage, represented \n\nby the remaining S. salamandra subspecies as a non-resolved polytomy, which indicates a sin-\n\ngle founder population that only relatively recently has expanded. \n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula this salamander (S. salamandra) is highly diversified and ten \n\nsubspecies are currently recognized (Salvador, 1974; Gasser, 1978; Joger &amp; Steinfartz, 1994; \n\nVeith, 1994; Steinfartz et al., 2000): S. s. terrestris, S. s. almanzoris, S. s. bejarae, S. s. bernarde-\n\nzi, S. s. fastuosa, S. s. gallaica, S. s. crespoi, S. s. morenica, S. s.  longirostris and S. s.  al-\n\nfredschmidti (described recently in K\u00f6hler &amp; Steinfartz 2006). With the exception of the first \n\nsubspecies, they are considered as endemic of the Iberian Peninsula (Salvador &amp; Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds \n\n2001; K\u00f6hler &amp; Steinfartz 2006). It is currently under discussion if the subspecies S. s. longiros-\n\ntris should be regarded as a different species, considering the results of the genetics studies by \n\nSteinfartz et al. 2000 and Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003. These two studies are important because \n\nthey both show that the genetic lineages identified in the Iberian S. salamandra subspecies do \n\nnot corroborate the nine subspecies that have been described in this geographic area as be-\n\nlonging to the polytypic species as described by Eiselt (1958) and Klewen (1991). Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds \n\net al. (2003) analysed sequence variation in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b (cytb) in \n\npopulations sampled throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and investigated the patterns of haplo-\n\ntype diversity within the three contact zones between the two viviparous subspecies (S. s. ber-\n\nnardezi and S. s. fastuosa, which progeny consists of relatively developed small larvae that are \n\ndirectly released into streams and ponds) and the ovoviviparous surrounding populations (S. s. \n\ngallaica and S. s. terrestris). The subspecies S. s. longirostris was found not to belong to the \n\nsame clade that the rest of the Iberian subspecies and the latter were divided into five distinct \n\ngenetic lineages. Like in Steinfartz et al. 2000, S. s. crespoi and S. s. morenica are considered \n\nwithin the same lineage, whereas S. s. almanzoris appears as a separated lineage but still with-\n\nin the same clade. A third lineage corresponds to the polytomy of the subspecies S. s. gallaica, \n\nS. s. terrestris, S. s. bejarae and the ovoviviparous populations of S. s. fastuosa. The other two \n\nlineages represent the viviparous populations of S. s. fastuosa and S. s. bernardezi. Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds \n\net al. (2003) also showed discordances between classifications based on external morphology \n\n(this is the criteria currently used to recognize subspecies), nuclear DNA (allozyme studies; \n\nAlcobendas et al. 1996) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data, along two of the three contact \n\nzones in northern Spain. These discordances are a consequence of hybridization after second-\n\nary contact of previously isolated lineages (Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003). \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThe current distribution of mtDNA genetic variation among widespread temperate \n\npopulations of different taxa is subdivided into patches of vicariant allospecies, subspecies, or \n\necotypes. The climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene led to range reductions, population ex-\n\ntinctions, and isolation in southern refugia during glacial periods, followed by postglacial range \n\nexpansions that generated parapatric distributions and secondary contact zones currently ob-\n\nserved (e.g. Bernatchez &amp; Wilson 1998; Hewitt 1999; Zamudio &amp; Savage 2003; G\u00f3mez &amp; Lunt \n\n2007). The Iberian Peninsula was one of the most important Pleistocene glacial refugia in the \n\nEuropean continent (Hewitt 1999; Hewitt 2001). There is growing genetic evidence for recent \n\nsubdivision among multiple refugia since many species display a strong population substruc-\n\nture within the Iberian glacial refugium, with the reciprocal monophyly of phylogeographic \n\nlineages suggesting physically-separated histories throughout the Pleistocene. It is this lack of \n\nadmixture between phylogeographic lineages, portrayed by geographically structured clades, \n\nwhich points to distinct Pleistocene \u2018refugia-within-refugia\u2019 (G\u00f3mez &amp; Lunt 2007). Such in-\n\nstances are seen in animals and plants such as Squalius (Brito et al. 1997; Coelho et al. 1998; \n\nZardoya &amp; Doadrio 1998), Discoglossus (Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds &amp; Jockusch 1999), Chioglossa lusitanica \n\n(Alexandrino et al. 2000), Lacerta schreiberi (Paulo et al. 2001; Paulo et al. 2002), Natrix maura \n\n(Guicking et al. 2008), Oryctolagus cuniculus (Branco et al. 2000; Branco et al. 2002), Arvicola \n\nsapidus (Centeno-Cuadros et al. 2009), Elona quimperiana (Vialatte et al. 2008), Artemia salina \n\n(Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2008), and Quercus (Olalde 2002).  \n\nIn Portugal, the fire salamander has a broad distribution but in the south it occurs \n\nwithin relatively small habitat patches, being absent in agricultural areas in the Baixo Alentejo \n\nregion due to the lack of tree cover (Rebelo 2008). Climatic and habitat features shape the \n\ndistribution of the two subspecies described in Portugal: S. s. gallaica (Seone, 1884) and S. s \n\ncrespoi (Malkamus, 1983). The first corresponds to the most recent lineage in Steinfartz et al. \n\n(2000) and has a wider distribution, from the north of Portugal to the Alto Alentejo region. It is \n\ncharacterized by smaller adults with a predominantly dark colour, few large rounded yellow \n\nspots, and the occasional presence of red spots on the flanks and throat. S. s. crespoi belongs \n\nto the most ancient lineage in Steinfartz et al. (2000) and presents a more restricted distribu-\n\ntion, being a Southern endemism in Portugal. This subspecies is characterized by a dorsal pat-\n\ntern with numerous small and irregular yellow dots that often show an elongated form (Rebelo \n\n2008; Almeida et al. 2001). Although specimens from Portugal were included in the studies by \n\nSteinfartz et al. 2000 and Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003, only 2 and 3 individuals were analysed, re-\n\nspectively, from the areas in which the two subspecies may contact. Besides, in one study \n\n(Steinfartz et al. 2000) a single sample from Alentejo was assigned to S. s. gallaica, whereas in \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nthe other study (Garcia-Paris et al. 2003) a sample from the same region was assigned to S. s. \n\ncrespoi.  \n\nIn fact, the limits of the distribution areas of the different S. salamandra subspecies \n\nremain mostly uncertain, emphasizing the need of more detailed studies at the spatial scale of \n\nthe postulated geographic boundaries between subspecies. Mart\u00ednez-Solano et al. (2005) car-\n\nried out a genetic survey, using the gene cytochrome-b and allozymes, on the endangered \n\nsubspecies S. s. almanzoris, which is the subspecies with a more restricted distribution in the \n\nIberia Peninsula. They were able to delimit the distribution area of the subspecies, but found \n\ndiscordance between the results of the different genetic markers, the coexistence of divergent \n\nmtDNA haplotypes in two populations, and discordance between external morphology and \n\nmtDNA haplotypes in different populations. These were suggested to be consequence of re-\n\ncent events of secondary contact between S. s. almanzoris and other subspecies of S. sala-\n\nmandra.  \n\n \n\nLandscape genetics \n\nDefining the geographical boundaries between populations and subspecies is fre-\n\nquently difficult because, as with the definition of species limits (but even more so), there are \n\noften areas of indeterminacy at prospective borders (Rowe &amp; Beebee 2007). The detection of \n\ngenetic boundaries in systems where species are either continuously or patchily distributed, \n\nand where discrete populations are not easily defined, may help to determine the underlying \n\ngenerating processes, such as important historical events (Miller et al. 2006) or current barri-\n\ners to gene flow (Coulon et al. 2006; Cushman et al. 2006; Safner et al. 2010). One approach \n\nbeing increasingly used to detect geographic boundaries between populations is landscape \n\ngenetics (Manel et al. 2003).      \n\nThe discipline of landscape genetics is an emerging field that integrates population ge-\n\nnetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics (Manel et al. 2003;  Storfer et al. 2007; \n\nHolderegger &amp; Wagner 2008) and its original definition states that it aims to provide infor-\n\nmation about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes \n\n(gene flow, genetic drift and selection) (Manel et al. 2003). It uses spatially explicit models to \n\nexamine how landscape features affect the spatial distribution of genetic variation (Manel et \n\nal. 2003; Holderegger &amp; Wagner 2006; Storfer et al. 2007).  \n\nStorfer et al. (2010) reviews the several questions that have been addressed in land-\n\nscape genetics: identification of genetic discontinuities, cryptic population boundaries, and \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nspecific barriers to dispersal (Manni et al. 2004; Funk et al. 2005; Zann\u00e8se et al. 2006; Rowe &amp; \n\nBeebee 2007; Latch et al. 2008; Gilles Guillot 2008), quantifying genetic diversity (Dom\u00ednguez-\n\nDom\u00ednguez et al. 2007; Segelbacher et al. 2008), inferring the effect of landscape change \n\n(Wagner et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2008), identification of migrants in relation to landscape con-\n\ndition (Wilmer et al. 2008; Janssens et al. 2008), estimation of source-sink dynamics (Lowe et \n\nal. 2006; Mart\u00ednez-Solano &amp; Gonz\u00e1lez 2008), prediction of spread of disease (Foley et al. 2005; \n\nWood et al. 2007; Deter et al. 2008) or invasive species (Lecis et al. 2007), and comparing ob-\n\nserved genetic patterns with contemporary and historic landscapes (Orsini et al. 2008; Spear &amp; \n\nStorfer 2008). Landscape genetics is also useful to study gene flow between populations, sub-\n\nspecies and species (Fitzpatrick &amp; Shaffer 2007; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Dionne et al. 2008; \n\nMaletzky et al. 2010; Leach\u00e9 2011; Bolf\u00edkov\u00e1 &amp; Hulva 2011), for instance to assess the pres-\n\nence of admixture or hybridization in zones of secondary contact. \n\nThe landscape genetics approach does not require an a priori identification of discrete \n\npopulations and considers the individual as the operational unit of analysis within the popula-\n\ntion (Manel et al. 2003; Wright 1931). Landscape genetics usually focuses in relatively small \n\nspatial scales, where individuals of a study species are mostly closely related; hence its labora-\n\ntory analysis has to rely on highly variable molecular markers that provide enough resolution \n\npower (Holderegger &amp; Wagner 2008). Currently, two different types of genetic markers are \n\ndominant in landscape genetics, namely amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and \n\nsingle sequence repeats (SSRs), with the latter being the mostly used (Storfer et al. 2010). \n\nLandscape genetics uses several different methodological tools to identify genetic patterns: \n\nWright\u2019s FST, Mantel\u2019s test, spatial autocorrelation, ordination analyses and synthesis maps, \n\nBayesian clustering approaches, edge detection methods (Monmonier\u2019s algorithm and Wom-\n\nbling) and other individual-based methods (e.g. Manel et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2008). \n\nTwo general families of methodologies are currently used to identify boundaries in \n\nlandscape genetics: edge detection methods and Bayesian clustering algorithms (Safner et al. \n\n2011). Edge detection methods identify areas where changes in variables occur from the anal-\n\nysis of allele frequency data, using approaches such as the Monmonier\u2019s algorithm \n\n(Monmonier 1973) and wombling (Womble 1951; Barbujani et al. 1989). Bayesian clustering \n\nalgorithms intend to identify discrete sets of individuals based on the analysis of multilocus \n\ngenotypes (Pritchard et al. 2000; Corander et al. 2003). The softwares that use these algo-\n\nrithms delineate clusters of individuals based on the analysis of individual genotypes, and also \n\nassign individuals to the identified cluster where their posterior probability is highest. In spatial \n\nmodels the probability that two individuals belong to a same cluster is influenced by their geo-\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\ngraphic distance, whereas geographic proximity is ignored in non-spatial models (Safner et al. \n\n2011). In a recent comparison, Bayesian spatial clustering algorithms outperformed edge de-\n\ntection methods, although all methods incorrectly detected boundaries in the presence of \n\nstrong patterns of isolation by distance (Safner et al. 2011). \n\n \n\nAims \n\nWith this work I intended to a) determine the geographic distribution and limits of the \n\ntwo Portuguese Salamandra salamandra subspecies at the putative contact zone in the \n\nsouthwest of the country, using data from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b and mi-\n\ncrosatellites analysed with landscape genetics tools; b) investigate if the two subspecies are \n\ncurrently in allopatry as currently accepted  in Portugal, or if there is evidence of simpatry be-\n\ntween the subspecies; c) evaluate the occurrence of gene flow between the named subspe-\n\ncies;  d) characterize the population genetic diversity of S. salamandra in the study area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nMaterial and methods  \n\nTissue samples were collected from 102 adults, using either toe clippings from live an-\n\nimals or muscle material from road kills, and from the tail tips of 116 larvae collected at 69 \n\ndifferent spawning sites, in a total of 216 samples for which the exact GPS coordinates were \n\nrecorded.  Tissue was stored in DMSO-salt solution (Seutin et al. 1991). The DNA was extracted \n\nusing the commercial kit EZNA Tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc) following the manufactur-\n\ner's instructions. \n\n \n\nMicrosatellite genotyping and cytochrome-b sequencing  \n\nDNA extracts were screened for 10 microsatellite loci: Sal E2, Sal E6, Sal E7, Sal E8, Sal \n\nE11, Sal E14, Sal 3, SST-A6II, SST-B11 and SST-C2 (Steinfartz et al. 2004, Hendrix et al. 2010). \n\nFor all loci, the forward primers were labelled with a 5\u2019 fluorescent tail (6-FAM and HEX) for \n\nvisualization. Each 10-\u00b5L PCR reaction contained 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 1\u00d7 reaction buff-\n\ner, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 \u00b5g BSA (Bovine Serum Albu-\n\nmin), and 0.75 U of the \u201chot-start\u201d HotSurf Taq DNA polymerase (StabVida). Thermal cycling \n\nconsisted of a \u201cstep down\u201d protocol, with a first part with annealing temperature at 65\u00baC-60\u00baC \n\n(depending of the primer) for 15 cycles followed by a second part with 60\u00baC-55\u00baC of annealing \n\ntemperature for 30 cycles. The loci were amplified individually and the PCR products ran in \n\nsets of two loci on an ABI 310 Capillary Electrophoresis Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). \n\nFragments were sized with ROX-500 size standard, collected with GeneScan version 3.1, scored \n\nwith Genemapper version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems), and the binning was performed with TAN-\n\nDEM version 1.08 (Matschiner et al. 2009).  \n\nIn Steinfartz et al. 2000 they used a D-loop 738 bp fragment, where it is shown that in \n\nSalamander species D-loop is not as informative as in mammals since has a low divergence and \n\nalso that the whole mitochondrium DNA seems to have the same substitution rate. While in \n\nGarc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al. 2003 is used a small fragment (372 bp) of cytochrome-b gene, hence in this \n\nwork it was preferred to use also cytochrome-b gene but new primers were designed to ampli-\n\nfy a longer fragment that would provide more information since it is used fresh samples.  \n\nAmplification and sequencing of 702 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial gene cyto-\n\nchrome-b were performed for a subset of 64 samples. The primers forward SALF 5?-\n\nCCTGAAGTAGGAACCAGATG-3? and reverse SALR 5?-TCAAAGCTTACACCAGTCTTGTAAACC-3? \n\nwere designed by aligning complete cytochrome-b sequences available in GenBank for several \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nspecies of amphibians. A 20-\u00b5L PCR reaction contained 50\u2013200 ng of DNA, 1\u00d7 reaction buffer, 2 \n\nmM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer, 2.2 \u00b5g BSA, and 1.25 U of SurfTaq \n\nDNA polymerase (StabVida). PCRs consisted of 35 cycles with a denaturing temperature of 94 \n\n\u00b0C (30 sec), annealing temperature at 57 \u00b0C (45 sec) and extension at 72 \u00b0C (1 min). Double-\n\nstranded amplification products were purified with ExoSAP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Puri-\n\nfied products were sequenced in both directions using the PCR primers and the Ez-Seq DNA \n\nsequencing service at Macrogen Inc., Europe. Cytochrome-b sequences were aligned using \n\nSEQUENCHER version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation). \n\n \n\nMicrosatellites and mitochondrial DNA data analysis  \n\nThe software CREATE (Coombs et al. 2008) and PGDSPIDER (version 2.0.0.3, available \n\nfrom http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/) were used to facilitate input file prep-\n\naration for all the software used for microsatellite and mtDNA data analysis.  \n\nThe program ML-RELATE (Kalinowski et al. 2006) was used to calculate maximum like-\n\nlihood estimates of relatedness and the likelihood of four pedigree relationships between each \n\npair of individual samples: uncorrelated, half-sibs, full-sibs and parent\u2013offspring. ML-RELATE \n\nuses maximum likelihood estimates of the frequency of null alleles in all calculations when null \n\nalleles are present. It calculates the likelihood of each relationship for each pair of individuals \n\nand generates a matrix of relationships with the highest likelihood, as well as a confidence set \n\nfor the relationship between pairs of individuals such that relationships excluded from the \n\nconfidence set can be ruled out as unlikely. \n\nTo infer the number of populations in the sample set and to assign individual samples \n\nto these groups, three Bayesian clustering techniques were employed. First, I used the GEN-\n\nELAND software (version 3.3.0; Guillot et al. 2005b), which has been developed to optimize the \n\ndelineation of subpopulations by incorporating spatial coordinates for each sample into the \n\nmodel. I varied K (the prior value for the number of subpopulations) from 1 to 10, using the \n\nmatrix of genotypes, spatial coordinates for each individual (uncertainty was set at 0 as I gave \n\na negligibly different coordinate to larvae samples taken from the same pond), and 10,000 \n\nstored MCMC iterations (1,000,000 iterations, thinning of 100) that were run 5 times.  Allele \n\nfrequencies were drawn from the uncorrelated frequency model that uses independent Di-\n\nrichlet distributions (Pritchard et al. 2000), as this model has been shown to perform better \n\nthan the alternative model (F-model; (Guillot et al. 2005a). The maximum rate of the Poisson \n\nprocess, which controls the number of polygons in the geographical area under study, was set \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nto 100. This value corresponds to strongly fragmented partitions and weak dependence on the \n\nspatial organization of populations. In the spatially-explicit GENELAND model, subpopulations \n\nare assumed to be partitioned, by Voronoi tessellation, into a union of a random number of \n\npolygons that are randomly assigned to one of K possible spatial clusters (Dupanloup et al. \n\n2002). In this software the model is of the type free Voronoi tessellation, as the polygons are \n\nconstructed independently of the sampling sites and are developed with basis on a continuous \n\nPoisson point process. Hence, the maximum number of nuclei within this tessellation was set \n\nto 300 (3 x maximum rate as suggested by Guillot et al. 2005a).  For all the runs, the posterior \n\nprobability of subpopulation membership was computed for each pixel of the spatial domain \n\n(100 x 100 pixels), using a burn-in of 200 iterations.  \n\nSecond, I used the software BAPS 5.4 (Corander &amp; Marttinen 2006; Corander et al. \n\n2008), which treats the number of populations as an unknown parameter that is directly in-\n\nferred from the data set without defining a prior estimate and also uses Voronoi tessellation \n\nbut in this case it is based on discrete sampling sites. For inferring population structure in the \n\nmitochondrial (cytochrome-b) and nuclear data sets, the individuals were assigned using the \n\nmodels \u201cclustering of linked loci\u201d (Corander &amp; Tang 2007) and \u201cspatial clustering of individu-\n\nals\u201d, respectively. The first does not take into account spatial information while the second \n\ndoes. The software was run with a predefined maximum of k ranging from 1 to 6 and runs \n\nwere repeated five times in order to check the stability of the results. The same clusters were \n\nassigned in all independent runs. The admixture analyses were performed based on the results \n\nof microsatellites mixture clustering, using 500 iterations and a number of 1000 reference in-\n\ndividuals per population, each with 10 reiterations.  \n\nFinally, I used the software STRUCTURE (version 2.3.3; Pritchard et al. 2000) to infer \n\ngenetic structuring by assigning individuals to a number of genetic clusters (k) without prior \n\nknowledge of their affinities. The software defines clusters within which the loci are at Hardy-\n\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium. This approach considers all clustering \n\nsolutions to be equally likely and does not consider the geographic coordinates. This infor-\n\nmation can however be used, after the data is processed, as a method to verify subpopulation \n\nmembership in the output generated by the software. The best K is chosen by comparing the \n\nposterior probabilities for different K values using methods that are not free of some subjectiv-\n\nity. A typically used method is the one described by Evanno et al. (2005) but, according to \n\nWaples &amp; Gaggiotti (2006), this method brings little improvement over previous ones. Using \n\nthe options to ignore population affiliation when clustering individuals, assuming independ-\n\nence among loci and allowing admixture (thereby estimating the proportion of individuals with \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nancestry in each cluster), I ran five independent runs of 1,000,000 iterations (following a burn-\n\nin period of 100,000) for each value of k from 1 to 6 (Pritchard et al. 2000).  The online soft-\n\nware program STRUCTURE HARVESTER (version 0.6.7; Earl &amp; VonHoldt 2011) was used to cal-\n\nculate delta k. \n\nThe subsequent analyses were done considering the clusters that were defined by the-\n\nse Bayesian clustering software programs.  \n\nIn order to detect, within each population, genotyping errors due to the presence of \n\nnull alleles, stuttering or large allele dropout, I used the bootstrap approach implemented in \n\nMICROCHECKER 2.2.3 (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Additionally, a maximum-likelihood esti-\n\nmate of the frequency of null alleles was calculated using the software FREENA (Chapuis &amp; \n\nEstoup 2007), which uses the algorithm of Dempster et al. (1977) and has been shown (Cha-\n\npuis &amp; Estoup 2007) to perform better than the other null allele frequency estimators available \n\nin MICROCHECKER.  Estimates of FST and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards\u2019 (1967) genetic distance \n\nwere also calculated using, respectively, the correction methods ENA and INA proposed by \n\nChapuis &amp; Estoup (2007), and that have been shown to efficiently correct the positive bias \n\ninduced by the presence of null alleles on these measures and provide accurate calculations in \n\npresence of null alleles. \n\nThree-dimensional factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was performed to visualize \n\npatterns of differentiation between populations using the GENETIX program (version 4.05.2; \n\nBelkhir et al. 2004). The result of the FCA represents the relationship between individuals \n\nbased on the detection of the best linear combination of allele frequencies. \n\nTo assess migration, three approaches were used: the BAYESASS software (version 1.3; \n\nWilson &amp; Rannala 2003) that estimates current migration rates among populations, the \n\nUSEPOPINFO model in STRUCTURE that uses the sampling locations to test for migrants, and \n\nthe GENECLASS software (version 2.0; Piry et al. 2004) that has the \u2018detection of first genera-\n\ntion migrants\u2019 function explicitly designed to identify first generation migrants (Paetkau et al. \n\n2004). BAYESASS relies on multilocus genotypes and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) \n\nalgorithm to estimate proportions of non-migrants as well as the source of migrants for each \n\nsampling site (Wilson &amp; Rannala 2003). This software is a non-equilibrium Bayesian method \n\nthat does not require data sets to conform to HWE proportions. I performed five independent \n\nreplicate runs of the algorithm for 9,000,000 iterations with 3,000,000 iterations discarded as \n\nburn-in. Delta values of migration rate (?m), allele frequencies (?p) and inbreeding coefficient \n\n(?F) were, respectively, ?m = 0.15, ?p = 0.15, and ?F = 0.15, which yielded an average number \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nof changes in the accepted range. I performed the additional round of admixture clustering \n\nwith STRUCTURE, now indicating the population of origin for each individual and setting the \n\nprior probability of each individual having pure ancestry from its assigned population at 0.95 \n\n(USEPOPINFO option, MIGRPRIOR = 0.05), and the other parameters as described above. This \n\nmodel assumes that most individuals have pure ancestry but that a proportion of individuals \n\nmay also have ancestry from other populations. GENECLASS uses several likelihood-based sta-\n\ntistics, in combination with resampling methods, to calculate the first generation migrant \n\nprobabilities. I used the L= L_home/L_max likelihood computation wherein L_home is the ratio \n\nof the likelihood of the individual genotype within the population where the individual has \n\nbeen sampled and L_max the highest likelihood value among all available population samples \n\n(Paetkau et al. 2004). To detect the first generation migrants, I used the Bayesian criterion of \n\nRannala &amp; Mountain (1997), in combination with the resampling method of Paetkau et al. \n\n(2004) to determine the critical value of the test statistic beyond which individuals were as-\n\nsumed to be migrants. I selected an alpha level of 0.05 to determine critical values and 10,000 \n\nas the number of simulated individuals. \n\nMSA (version 4.05; Dieringer &amp; Schl\u00f6tterer 2003) and GENEPOP (version 4.1, Rousset \n\n2008) were used to estimate genetic diversity in each obtained cluster as measured by the \n\nparameters number of alleles per locus (NA), allelic richness (AR), observed (Ho) and unbiased \n\nexpected (He) heterozygosities, and to test for Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and for \n\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD) between loci. The HWE was verified testing for a deficiency of het-\n\nerozygotes relative to Hardy\u2013Weinberg expectations for each locus, using the Markov chain \n\nmethod for estimating P-values (Guo &amp; Thompson 1992; parameter values of dememorization \n\n= 50,000,000, number of batches = 100, number of iterations per batch = 1,000,000). The same \n\nmethod was used to assess LD (parameter values of dememorization = 100,000,000, number \n\nof batches = 200, number of iterations per batch = 50,000,000). A sequential Bonferroni cor-\n\nrection (Rice 1989) was used to control for multiple comparisons. \n\nSpatial structure was examined using a Mantel test, performed with GENALEX (version \n\n6.0; Peakall &amp; Smouse 2006). The Mantel test was performed between the triangular matrix of \n\npairwise geographical distances between individuals and the triangular matrix of pairwise ?st \n\nvalues between individuals. \n\nI used the software BOTTLENECK (version 1.2.02; Piry et al. 1999) to evaluate if there \n\nwere signs of a genetic bottleneck signature in the microsatellite data. In particular, I carried \n\nout 100,000 replications using the infinite alleles model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nmodel (SMM). The sign test compares the number of loci that present a heterozygosity excess \n\nrelatively to the number of such loci expected by chance alone.  \n\nFor the analyses of mitochondrial DNA, I used a subset of 64 samples from the total \n\nsample set (N=203) that attempted to maintain the level of geographic coverage of the total \n\nsample set while minimising the eventual redundancy of using multiple samples from the same \n\nsampling sites (the used samples are identified in Appendix table 1). \n\nThe median-joining algorithm in the software NETWORK (version 4.6.0.0; Bandelt et al. \n\n1999) was used to infer a network of haplotype relationships. Information on the geographic \n\ndistribution of the haplotypes was subsequently added to the network using a colour code to \n\nrepresent geographic locations. \n\nGenetic diversity for the cytochrome-b fragment was measured in each population by \n\nthe number of haplotypes, haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (?) as estimated by \n\nDNASP (version 5.10.01; Librado and Rozas 2009). ARLEQUIN (version 3.5.1.2; Excoffier et al. \n\n2010) as used to estimate mean population pairwise FST statistics that were computed using \n\nthe model of Tamura and Nei (1993). Significant departures from the null hypothesis (no ge-\n\nnetic differentiation) were tested using 10,000 permutations. \n\nThe software ARLEQUIN was also employed to carry out two neutrality tests known for \n\ntheir additional ability to detect signatures of historical population expansion. The tests are \n\nTajima\u2019s D (Tajima 1989a, 1989b, 1993), which compares the number of segregating sites in \n\nthe sample and a parameter based on the mean number of pairwise differences between hap-\n\nlotypes, and Fu\u2019s FS (Fu 1997), based on the probability of observing k alleles in a sample of a \n\ngiven size conditioned on the observed average number of pairwise differences. Also in order \n\nto test for demographic expansions, statistics based on the mismatch distribution were esti-\n\nmated with ARLEQUIN. The mismatch distribution (MMD) is the observed distribution of pair-\n\nwise differences between pairs of haplotypes. This distribution is usually multimodal in sam-\n\nples drawn from populations at demographic equilibrium, but it is usually unimodal in popula-\n\ntions having passed through a recent demographic expansion (Rogers &amp; Harpending 1992; \n\nSlatkin &amp; Hudson 1991), or through a range expansion with high levels of migration between \n\nneighbouring demes (Ray et al. 2003; Excoffier 2004). The observed distribution of pairwise \n\ndifferences was calculated within each population and compared with the expected results \n\nunder a sudden-demographic and a spatial-demographic expansion model. Statistically signifi-\n\ncant differences between observed and simulated expected distributions were evaluated using \n\nthe sum of the square deviations (SSD) and Harpending\u2019s raggedness index (RAG) (Harpending \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n1994). The time since the expansion began was estimated using the MMD ? (tau, estimator of \n\nthe time since expansion) with ? = 2 n ? TGt, where n is the number of nucleotides of the DNA \n\nsequence, ? is the substitution rate in mutations per site per year and TGt is the time in gener-\n\nations (Rogers &amp; Harpending 1992).  \n\nPopulation divergence time was estimated using the coalescent method described by \n\nGaggiotti &amp; Excoffier (2000), also implemented in ARLEQUIN. The method removes the effect \n\nof bottlenecks and unequal sizes of the derived populations, which can lead to the overestima-\n\ntion of divergence times from genetic distances. Here ? (tau) is also the time estimator from \n\ngenetic distance but its conversion to years before present is done with a slightly different \n\nformula: ? = 2 n ? T, where n is the number of nucleotides of the DNA sequence, ? is the sub-\n\nstitution rate in mutations per site per year and T is time in years. Divergence time was also \n\nestimated using a similar equation DA = 2 n ? T in which n is the number of nucleotides of the \n\nDNA sequence, ? is the substitution rate in mutations per site per year, T is the divergence \n\ntime, and DA is the net number of nucleotide differences between populations (Nei &amp; Li 1979). \n\n Population divergence time was also estimated using the software IMA (Hey &amp; Nielsen \n\n2007), which implements a coalescent-based isolation with migration model and can be ap-\n\nplied to genetic data drawn from a pair of closely related populations or species (Nielsen &amp; \n\nWakeley 2001) to infer some demographic parameters: effective population sizes of the pre-\n\nsent and of the ancestor populations, migration rates between the daughter populations, and \n\nthe splitting time (t). The program performs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation \n\nwith the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in which random samples from the joint posterior \n\nprobability density of the model parameters are generated. To evaluate if the program has run \n\nfor enough time, so that the sample has converged to the true posterior probability distribu-\n\ntion, the effective Sample Size (ESS), which is a measure of the independence of the recorded \n\nvalues over the course of the run, should have values greater than 200 for any estimated pa-\n\nrameter. Four replicate simulations were run after the preliminary runs to optimize settings. \n\nSimulations used 10 Markov chains, with 45 chain swap attempts per step, were run for 50 \n\nmillion steps with the first 100,000 steps discarded as \u201cburn-in\u201d, and the genealogies were \n\nsampled every 100 steps. To convert coalescent times to years before present, I used a genera-\n\ntion time of 5 years (Rebelo 2002) and a 0.8% per MYR substitution rate. Steinfartz et al. \n\n(2000) used this rate value, and stated that in salamanders the substitution rate seems overall \n\nuniform across the mitochondrial DNA, and studies in other urodeles have used similar rates \n\n(Tan &amp; Wake 1995; Caccone et al. 1997; Mueller 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nResults  \nMicrosatellites \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1 Bayesian clustering results based on 10 microsatellite loci.

The 216 \n\nsamples were evaluated \n\nwith the software ML-RELATE to remove all full-sibling and parent-offspring samples that could \n\nbe present in the sampling.  Goldberg &amp; Waits (2010) have shown that the removal of these \n\nrelatives reduces the bias of sampling larvae and improves estimates of population genetic \n\nparameters in studies of amphibians. The full-siblings in a distance of approximately 1 km were \n\nremoved. Three adults and 10 larvae were excluded, so the data set for subsequent analyses \n\nconcerned 203 samples from 168 different sampling locations (fig. 2). All analyses were done \n\nwith the samples ordered by geographical Y axes of their coordinates and no samples with \n\nmissing data were taken into account. \n\nAll the 10 loci were described as tetranucleotide microsatellite loci (Steinfartz et al. \n\n2004 and Hendrix et al. 2010), but in the populations analysed here the loci Sal E2 and Sal E11 \n\nbehaved like dinucleotide loci in terms of allele bins.  \n\n All the three software programs used to infer the number of clusters indicated the \n\npresence of 2 clusters (fig. 1). In GENELAND the samples were consistently assigned to the \n\nsame cluster in all runs, even if the density for the best k was not much higher than 40% (Ap-\n\npendix fig. 1). In figures 1A and 1B it is visible that all samples were assigned with high proba-\n\nbilities to each cluster and how the two clusters are spatially distributed. BAPS assigned almost \n\nall samples to the same two clusters that GENELAND detected. Because the spatial clustering \n\nof individuals (Corander et al. 2008) was used, the output of BAPS gives a spatial representa-\n\ntion of the clustering. This allowed to identify three samples that should be migrants or ad-\n\nmixed individuals (figures 1C and 1D). \n\n \n\nFig. 2 Distribution map of Salamandra salamandra according to Rebelo (2008) \nand sample locations within the postulated area of two subspecies contact in \nsouthwest Portugal.   \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nSTRUCTURE also identified k = 2 (fig. 1E) as best fitting the data, using the method of \n\nEvanno et al. (2005), but with more admixture that is probably due to the software sensitivity \n\nwhen the assumptions are not met (see below). Taking into account the findings of Safner et \n\nal. (2011), the clustering solution offered by GENELAND was considered the most reliable. The \n\ngeographic boundary between the clusters seems to match with an area south of the River \n\nSado in which no fire salamanders could be found despite being prospected several times in \n\ndifferent times, seasons and years, for both adults and larvae. The distribution map with the \n\nsamples assigned to each of the two clusters is presented in fig. 2. Given that the geographic \n\nlocation of the clusters correspond to the areas north and south of the detected boundary \n\nthey are henceforth designated, respectively, as \u201cNorthern\u201d (80 individuals) and \u201cSouthern\u201d \n\n(123 individuals). \n\nAfter the population genetic structure of the data was identified, the presence of null \n\nalleles in the analysed microsatellite loci was tested using two methodologies: the algorithm of \n\nOosterhout et al. (2004), incorporated in the software MICROCHECKER, and the algorithm of \n\nDempster et al. (1977) integrated in the software FREENA. The second estimator was chosen \n\nbecause it has been shown to perform better than the other estimators available in MICRO-\n\nCHECKER (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). MICROCHECKER found no evidence for scoring errors due \n\nto stuttering or large allele dropout, but \n\nfound evidence for null alleles in some of \n\nthe loci.  \n\nAmong the 10 analysed loci, only \n\ntwo consistently exhibited signs of the \n\npresence of null alleles with both ap-\n\nproaches and in both clusters (table 1). \n\nGiven the results of MICROCHECKER, the \n\nBayesian clustering analyses to infer the \n\nnumber of clusters were repeated using \n\nonly the eight loci not showing signs of \n\nthe presence of null alleles, and the re-\n\nsults did not visibly differ from the anal-\n\nyses using the 10 loci (Appendix fig. 1).  Chapuis and Estoup (2007) described a method that \n\nallows estimating the FST following Weir (1996) and the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' (1967) \n\ngenetic distance from microsatellite data sets harbouring null alleles. The corrected FST be-\n\ntween the two clusters was 0.034309 and the uncorrected one was 0.034998, while the cor-\n\nTable 1 Estimation of null allele frequencies by population \nusing the algorithm of Oosterhout et al.

Northern population represented by green and Southern by red \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nmigrants, but none presented a probability inferior to 0.5 of belonging to the originally as-\n\nsigned cluster (fig. 4). Bearing in mind the presence of null allele loci the cut-off value was low-\n\nered to 0.9, in this way when considering probabilities inferior to 0.9 (Appendix table 1) several \n\nindividuals appear as admixed, which could be a sign of past gene flow \n\n GENECLASS identified 10 migrants (Appendix table 1). Considering this result and the \n\nones from STRUCTURE and BAPS concerning migrants, it was possible to detect eight migrants \n\nbetween the two clusters (represented by filled triangles in the distribution map) that were \n\nidentified by at least two of the three methods. \n\nSince the presence of null alleles could affect the evaluation of genetic variability in \n\neach cluster, I used the mean expected heterozygosity (He, Nei 1987) because the presence of \n\nnull alleles has only a limited effect on this statistic (Chapuis &amp; Estoup 2007). Overall, the 10 \n\nloci and both populations showed high genetic variability. \n\nCorrelation between genetic and geographic distances was assessed for each popula-\n\ntion by Mantel tests. For the Northern population it had a p-value of 0.043 and a Pearson cor-\n\nrelation coefficient (R) of 0.063, while for the Southern population it had a p-value = 0.01 and \n\nR = 0.156. Although the null hypothesis of a random genetic distribution of individuals can be \n\nrejected, the support for isolation-by-distance (IBD) was low to moderate.  \n\nThe allele frequency distribution test showed that no shift in distribution could be de-\n\ntected for both populations, which remained in a normal L-shape (Appendix fig. 3), so the mi-\n\ncrosatellite data indicates that both populations did not undergo a recent bottleneck.  \n\nTable 3 Genetic diversity measures by populations for the ten microsatellite loci used.

The Northern population is mainly characterised by two \n\ndivergent haplotypes separated by 10 mutations and one sample was identified as a migrant in \n\nthe Southern population. In this population, four haplotypes were uncovered and a fifth close-\n\nly-related haplotype was found in two individuals sampled in the Northern population.  \n\n BAPS produced similar results (fig. 5B) to the ones given by NETWORK, identifying 3 \n\nclusters: Southern and two clusters within the Northern population. It also detected the same \n\nthree samples as from likely migrants. When comparing these migrant individuals detected \n\nfrom cytochrome-b data with the ones detected with microsatellites, only one individual was \n\nidentified as a migrant by both markers. This individual is likely to represent a very recent mi-\n\ngration event. \n\nEstimates of genetic diversity obtained from the 702 bp cytochrome-b fragment are \n\npresented in table 4.  Although more samples were analysed in the Southern population, with \n\nthe exception of haplotype diversity, most diversity measures were lower in this population \n\nthan in the Northern population. Mean population pairwise FST between Northern and South-\n\nern populations was high (0.75115).  \n\n \n \n\nFig. 5 mtDNA phylogeography and population structure of Salamandra salamandra in SW Portugal as inferred from \ncytochrome-b partial sequences of 64 individuals.

In the Southern population, the \n\nPSSD = 0.0759 in the sudden expansion model also suggested demographic equilibrium but the \n\nPRAG = 0.0145 of the same model and the spatial expansion model (PSSD = 0.0077, PRAG = 0.0132) \n\nindicate that this population should have undergone a recent demographic expansion.  \n\nFurther assessment of past demography was provided by applying the neutrality tests \n\nTajima\u2019s (1989) D and Fu\u2019s (1997) FS. For the Northern population, the results of Tajima\u2019s D (D \n\n= 0.05967, PD = 0.5767) were in agreement with a demographic equilibrium, whereas Fu\u2019s FS (FS \n\n= -23.49389, PFS = 0.000) was not. For the southern population, past population expansion was \n\nsupported by both tests (D = -2.29332, PD = 0.0013; FS = -26.93731, PFS = 0.000). \n\nThe time since the beginning of this expansion was estimated using the mismatch dis-\n\ntribution approach (Rogers &amp; Harpending 1992) and the sudden and the spatial expansion \n\nmodels gave similar ? (tau): 1.053 and 1.052, respectively. This is respectively translated into \n\nan expansion time at 18,750 years before present (BP) with a 95% confidence interval of 4,274 \n\n\u2013 32,835 years BP and at 18,732 years BP with a 95% confidence interval of 6,695 \u2013 29,879 \n\nyears BP. \n\nThe four simulations of the isolation with migration model implemented in IMa pro-\n\nduced similar parameter estimates and distributions, with ESSs exceeding 200 for each esti-\n\nmated parameter. The results of IMa suggest that the Northern and Southern populations \n\ndiverged 208,333 years BP (90% HPD = 103,785 \u2013 ?) considering a 0.8% per million years muta-\n\ntion rate and 5 years as generation time. The credibility intervals were recorded as the 90% \n\nHPD interval, which represents the shortest span that includes 90% of the probability density \n\nof the parameter, but the upper bound for the credibility interval is not given since it critically \n\ndepends on the assumed prior for the maximum value of t when the curve slowly decreases to \n\nzero after the mode of t (Johnson et al. 2007; Guillaumet et al. 2008). The approach of Gag-\n\ngiotti and Excoffier (2000) estimated the divergence between the Northern and Southern pop-\n\nulations at 957,975 years BP (? = 10.76).

I tested oth-\n\ner loci from the same panels but they were discarded because they showed weak amplification \n\n(Sal 29 and SST-G6) and binning problems likely due to false alleles (Sal23 and Sal E12). These \n\ndifficulties were surprising because Hendrix et al. (2010) tested for the correlation between \n\ncross-amplification success and genetic distance within the Salamandridae family, and most of \n\nthe used loci in this work had amplification success across species of the genus Salamandra \n\n(except for SST-C2 and Sal E11). This shows that although cross-amplification tests provide an \n\nuseful preliminary insight of which primers might be employed in different species, there is no \n\nguarantee that the loci will be problem-free and not show deviations of Hardy-Weinberg equi-\n\nlibrium (HWE) caused by multiple distinct factors, even when marker transfer is just between \n\nsubspecies of the species in which the microsatellites were isolated. \n\nThe determination of the population genetic structure in the dataset, previous to car-\n\nrying out tests of HWE, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and null alleles, was important to remove \n\nthe Wahlund effect (which was shown to be strong here) before assessing the quality of each \n\nlocus for population genetic analysis. This approach allowed identifying the only loci (two) that \n\nshowed unambiguous and consistent signs of null alleles. \n\nML-RELATE was used to detect samples with parent-offspring or full-sibling relation-\n\nships, so that one of the individuals in each such pair could be removed. The use of this soft-\n\nware allowed using the data of the two loci with null alleles because it has been shown (Wag-\n\nner et al. 2006) that the method incorporated in ML-RELATE to deal with null alleles performs \n\nbetter than ignoring the presence of null alleles or discarding the affected loci.  \n\nConcerning the three Bayesian clustering methods, to check the impact of the null al-\n\nleles, I repeated all the analyses without the two loci with null alleles identified in both clus-\n\nters, and overall they gave the same results (Appendix fig. 1).  To assess if the loci with null \n\nalleles could have an effect in measures of genetic distance and genetic differentiation I ap-\n\nplied the correction method of Chapuis and Estoup (2007) implemented in FREENA. This ap-\n\nproach indicated that the loci with null alleles did not influence significantly those measures \n\nand, therefore, final analyses were done using the 10 loci.   \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nThe three Bayesian clustering algorithms identified two clusters, one in the north of \n\nthe study area that I designated \u201cNorthern\u201d and can be associated with S. s. gallaica and the \n\nother that I designated \u201cSouthern\u201d and can be associated with S. s. crespoi. Despite this con-\n\ngruent main result, slight differences were identified between the results of the three meth-\n\nods. GENELAND did not detect any migrants, BAPS showed some migrants, and STRUCTURE \n\nindicated some signs of admixture. Previous studies have noted that different clustering algo-\n\nrithms can infer different solutions. For instance, Rowe &amp; Beebee (2007) reported non-\n\ncongruent outputs from BAPS, GENELAND, and STRUCTURE, in terms of the estimated number \n\nof clusters. The results here do not show such level of incongruence between methods most \n\nlikely because of the strong pattern of differentiation between the two subspecies, but it is \n\nworth noting that the slight differences detected could be due to differences in the underlying \n\nmodels, in the statistical estimators, or in the approximations in the algorithms used to com-\n\npute the estimators. It is important to mention that all the programs use the genetic infor-\n\nmation to ascertain population membership of individuals without assuming predefined popu-\n\nlations, operate by minimizing Hardy\u2013Weinberg and linkage disequilibria, and the assignment \n\nof each individual genotype to its population of origin is carried out probabilistically using Mar-\n\nkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The use of MCMC is prone to convergence issues, this is, the \n\nsoftware outputs might not be in certain cases the exact solution of the mathematical equa-\n\ntions but an approximation which quality remains unknown. \n\nThe two obtained clusters seem separated by a narrow gap of 20Km in width that cor-\n\nresponds, approximately, to an area where the Sado River passes plus a belt of sandy soil \n\nsouth of it. Results from the analyses of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b indicated a simi-\n\nlar partition boundary. Finally, despite repeated and intensive sampling efforts, no individuals \n\ncould be found within the area. The fact that both mtDNA and microsatellites concur in sug-\n\ngesting a very reduced gene flow across the gap indicates that it has been a strong barrier both \n\nhistorically and contemporarily. Of all the methods used, only the ordination of individuals \n\nusing the factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) did not show a discrete separation of the \n\npopulations. However, it is known that the FCA may not have the needed resolution power \n\nwhen genetic differentiation as measured by FST is low, as is the case here (FST = 0.034). Despite \n\nstrong isolation between populations, FST values can be low if gene flow, albeit very restricted, \n\nis historically recurrent.   \n\nThe low migration rates detected with the software BAYESASS between the two sub-\n\nspecies are consistent with the hypothesis of a strong barrier separating them. Additionally, \n\nBAPS only identified three migrants, STRUCTURE (when defining the populations a priori) de-\n\n\n\n25 \n \n\ntected few admixed individuals, and GENECLASS found 10 migrants. When considering as mi-\n\ngrants only those individuals indicated by two or more software, eight individuals were identi-\n\nfied among the 203 analysed individuals, again consistent with a scenario of reduced gene \n\nflow. The analyses of mtDNA found three migrants within the 64 surveyed individuals. Of the \n\neight migrants detected with microsatellites only four were sequenced for their mtDNA, but \n\none individual was identified has migrant by both genetic markers (Appendix table 1). The \n\nthree migrants identified by microsatellites but not by mtDNA are recent but most likely less \n\nthan the individual in which both markers concur. The very low number of migrants in terms of \n\nmtDNA is evidence for a historically very reduced gene flow. \n\nThe two migrants detected in the Northern population by their mtDNA presented a \n\nhaplotype closely related but distinct of the haplotypes found in all individuals of the Southern \n\npopulation, which suggests a different source. I hypothesise that these migrants possibly origi-\n\nnated from a different area, south of the Guadiana River, of the distribution of S. s. crespoi. To \n\ntest this hypothesis it is necessary to study in the future the contact zone of the two Portu-\n\nguese subspecies in southeast Portugal.   \n\nIt was detected isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns in both populations but relatively \n\nweak as measured by the low correlation coefficients in the Mantel tests. However, it was not \n\ndetected any indication of substructure within each population (Appendix fig. 4), a finding that \n\nis consistent with the presence of IBD. Possibly, the IBD patterns detected in both populations \n\nare real but high correlation coefficients in the Mantel tests would only be observed with a \n\nmore numerous and dense sampling from each population. Alternatively, the spatial arrange-\n\nment of the genetic variation in the populations might be better described by an isolation-by-\n\nresistance (IBR) model which predicts a closer fit of genetic distance with resistance distance \n\nthan with Euclidian geographic distance (McRae 2006). The IBR model attempts to account for \n\nthe effect of habitat heterogeneity in shaping IBD patterns. To test this alternative, in addition \n\nto an improved sampling it would be necessary to construct a Geographic Information System \n\n(GIS) for the study area. \n\nNo signs of recent bottlenecks were detected in the microsatellite data from both \n\npopulations. However, a bottleneck was suggested by the mtDNA data for the Southern popu-\n\nlation, which coherently exhibited the lowest nucleotide and haplotype diversities. Support for \n\na sudden demographic expansion in the Southern population comes from its unimodal mis-\n\nmatch distribution and from a small value of the raggedness index (=0.0132). This suggests \n\nthat, although both populations might be large for some time now, S. s. crespoi underwent \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\npreviously a expansion from a small population size. The time estimator (tau) of the mismatch \n\ndistribution (MMD) dated this expansion around 18,000 years ago and this date is congruent \n\nbetween the two MMD models (sudden expansion and spatial expansion) used. This date is \n\ncompatible with a scenario in which, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (between 26,500 \n\nand 19,000\u201320,000 years ago; Clark et al. 2009), S. s. crespoi suffered a severe demographic \n\ncontraction and, after the LGM, the population recovered rapidly with the return of favourable \n\nclimatic conditions.  The support of the data for a spatial expansion of S. s. crespoi after the \n\nLGM opens the possibility that the present geographic proximity between the two subspecies \n\nin an almost parapatric distribution, might have been established relatively recently. This \n\nwould be in agreement with the very reduced number of migrants detected between subspe-\n\ncies. Also, around 18,000 years ago almost all of the Portuguese continental shelf was above \n\nsea level, which allowed the confluence of northern Portuguese rivers (Rodrigues and Dias, \n\n1989) and one may hypothesize that a similar phenomenon could have happened with the \n\nsouthern rivers. Enlarged and connected, the Sado and Guadiana Rivers, even if allowing some \n\ngene flow northwards, would have bogged down the expansion of S. s. crespoi. After the con-\n\ntraction and split of the river basins, the soil characteristics of many of the exposed riverbeds \n\ncreated strong barriers to dispersal. It is feasible that this scenario for the contraction and ex-\n\npansion of S. s. crespoi in southern Portugal has been replayed along the glacial-interglacial \n\ncycles of the Late Pleistocene. \n\nThe idea of this subspecies to have survived the LGM in a refuge in western Algarve, an \n\narea known to have been a refuge and a hotspot of evolutionary diversification for several \n\ntaxa (Mesquita et al. 2005, Martinez-Solano et al. 2006, Fritz et al. 2006), would also agree \n\nwith the fact that within this area (Serra de Monchique) the external morphological character-\n\nistics of the individuals are the more conspicuously typical of S. s. crespoi. \n\n Three methods were used to estimate the divergence time between the two popula-\n\ntions, as this parameter could provide further valuable insights into their evolutionary history. \n\nThe estimate derived from DA (Nei &amp; Li 1979) was 1.4 million years and the method of Gaggiot-\n\nti &amp; Excoffier (2000) estimated it around 958,000 years ago. However, it needs to be empha-\n\nsized that the two methods assume complete isolation of the daughter populations after the \n\nsplit, so they accommodate poorly instances of recurrent gene flow, as it seems to be the case \n\nhere. In such cases, these methods tend to overestimate population divergence time and their \n\nresults here fall somewhat halfway between the IMa estimate and the phylogenetic dating for \n\nthe divergence of the lineages leading to the subspecies crespoi and gallaica (Steinfartz et al. \n\n2000). The software IMa belongs to a recent set of programs, based in coalescent genealogies, \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nwhich generally are more powerful and robust than the two methods above to infer popula-\n\ntion parameters (Kuhner 2009). In particular, IMa is explicitly designed to take into account \n\nrecurrent gene flow after population split (i.e. the last \u201cmoment\u201d in which subpopulations \n\nwere connected by \u201cabundant\u201d gene flow) (e.g. Palsboll et al. 2004). The IMa estimate was \n\naround 208,000 years BP. \n\nDue to the stochastic nature of mutation and lineage sorting, estimated divergence \n\ntimes from genetic patterns must be considered only as rough approximations of the timing of \n\nhistorical events. Factors like the uncertainty on the substitution rate for the DNA region under \n\nstudy, unsampled populations, and small sample sizes, increase confidence limits on diver-\n\ngence time estimates. Keeping this in mind, I discuss below possible environmental correla-\n\ntions that could explain the indication by the mtDNA data of genetic connectivity between the \n\ntwo subspecies in the study area at around 210,000 years BP. \n\nAround 220,000-210,000 years BP there is evidence for a period of warm and wet cli-\n\nmate and expansion of Quercus forests in western Iberia (Desprat et al. 2006, Roucoux et al. \n\n2006), which corresponds to a period of global favourable climate between the oxygen isotope \n\nstages (OIS) 7c and 7a. Besides a short peak of similar climate around 120,000 years ago, only \n\ntoday the climate in Europe is as favourable as at the OIS 7c-7a interval (Tzedakis et al. 1997). \n\nA warm and wet climate is likely to have led to an enlarged and tributary-rich Sado River that, \n\ntogether with an expanded forested habitat, would have facilitated gene flow to levels without \n\nany parallel since then. The fact that the Guadiana drainage was probably an affluent of the \n\nSado River until the end of the Middle Pleistocene (Vidal et al. 1993) offers further support to \n\nthe idea that expanded riverine connections, together with abundant forested land-cover, \n\ncould have allowed substantial genetic exchange between the two subspecies across Alentejo. \n\nIt has been suggested that in amphibians, large rivers, such as Douro and Tagus, pre-\n\nvent dispersal of individuals between distant across river locations (Alexandrino et al. 2000; \n\nMartinez-Solano 2004). However, although the phylogeography of S. s. gallaica has not been \n\nexamined yet in detail across its whole range, it is possible that this subspecies managed to \n\ncross these two large rivers. Moreover, although salamander adults seem to have a reduced \n\ndispersal capacity (Rebelo &amp; Leclair 2003; Schmidt et al. 2007), juveniles or larvae can be \n\ntransported by runoff water or floods) and undergo sweepstake dispersal (possibly across large \n\ndistances). \n\nThe modelling of the distribution of Salamandra salamandra in south Portugal showed \n\nthat a large percentage of the distribution can be explained by the absence of sand, pebbles \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nand clays (Appendix fig. 5; Sim\u00f5es et al. in prep.). This suggests that the strong barrier detected \n\nin this study is probably the consequence of the combined effect of the Sado River and the \n\narea of unsuitable habitat south of it. Presently, it is perhaps this belt of unsuitable habitat of \n\nsandy soil the most important component of the boundary between the two subspecies in \n\nsouthwest Portugal. The very reduced gene flow detected between these populations is inter-\n\npreted as the result of rare and stochastic dispersal events up and down the Sado River. \n\n In the near future I pretend to assess some of the hypotheses raised by this study, the \n\nfirst using a landscape genetics approach to examine the intraspecific patterns of the fire sal-\n\namander in Portugal. Among them, the possible migration route across the Guadiana in the \n\nsoutheast of the country and, connected with this, the probable absence of the species in cen-\n\ntral Alentejo before it became an agricultural area in the Middle Ages. It will also be important \n\nto test the isolation-by-resistance hypothesis and correlate the resistance matrix obtained \n\nfrom an habitat suitability map with the genetic distance matrix, in order to better understand \n\nwhich landscape features and variables influence the genetic structure of the species.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nReferences \n\nAlcobendas M, Dopazo H, Alberch P (1996) Geographic variation in allozymes of populations of \nSalamandra salamandra (Amphibia: Urodela) exhibiting distinct reproductive modes. \nJournal of Evolutionary Biology 9:83-102. \n\nAlexandrino J, Froufe E, Arntzen J, Ferrand N (2000) Genetic subdivision, glacial refugia and \npostglacial recolonization in the golden-striped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica (Am-\nphibia: Urodela).
