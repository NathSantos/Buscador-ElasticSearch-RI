Com esse objetivo foram \ncultivadas larvas de M. galloprovincialis por um per\u00edodo de 6 e 14 \ndias e criados tratamentos combinados de temperatura (12, 17, 20 e \n\n25\u00b0C) e de salinidade (26, 32 and 37).

Estes resultados real\u00e7am a poss\u00edvel influ\u00eancia da \n\ntemperatura sob a disponibilidade de cada elemento. Outro aspeto a \n\nter em conta \u00e9 o facto de a 17\u00b0C serem encontradas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\n\u00f3timas para o desenvolvimento larvar, e por isso tamb\u00e9m da \n\nsecre\u00e7\u00e3o da concha carbonatada do mexilh\u00e3o, existindo uma maior \n\nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos do ambiente.

Relativamente ao Zn estes efeitos foram apenas \n\nsignificativos quando n\u00e3o combinados.

The determination of dispersion patterns has \n\nbeen relevant to conservation studies of species, management of \n\nfisheries stocks and even for the understanding of ecological \n\nprocesses as the extinction and re-colonization of populations. \n\nCarbonate structures of marine organisms work as an archive of \n\nenvironmental information. Through geochemical analysis of fish \n\notoliths, as well as statoliths and shells of invertebrates is possible to \n\ndiscover physical and chemical environmental conditions under \n\nwhich these organisms developed and trace dispersion patterns and \n\nnatal habitats. However, the incorporation of trace elements in these \n\nstructures is highly regulated by a range of physical and chemical \n\nenvironmental factors as well as physiological and biochemical. \n\nThese factors should be considered for an accurate use of \n\ngeochemical signatures as a means of geographical identification. In \n\norder to investigate how the geochemical composition of larval shells \n\nfrom the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis is influenced by \n\nenvironmental and temporal conditions, individuals were submitted to \n\ndifferent temperatures, salinities and  water elemental \n\nconcentrations. The main objective was to understand how the \n\nelemental incorporation varies with different parameters of each \n\nenvironmental factor, and if the same is influenced by age. M. \n\ngalloprovincialis larval were reared during 6 and 14 days under \n\ncombined treatments of temperature (12, 17, 20 and 25\u00b0 C) and \n\nsalinity (26, 32, and 37). Concentrations of the elements Mg, Mn, Ba, \n\nSr, Cu and Zn by the ratio of Ca were analyzed through ICP-MS \n\n(inductively wound couple plasma-mass spectrometry) analysis. \n\nElemental fingerprinting, mussel larval shells, temperature, salinity, \n\nlarval dispersal, Mediterranean mussel \n\n\n\n  \n\nix \n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n(Cont.) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSimultaneously another set of individuals were submitted to \n\ndifferent concentrations of Cu and Zn for a period of approximately \n\n3 days. No significant variability in chemical composition was found \n\nin larval shells between larval with 6 and 14 days of development, \n\nsuggesting a stable geochemical signature, for this period, and no \n\nage effect on incorporation. On a second approach, was detected a \n\nmaximum incorporation of these elements at 17\u00b0 C and at different \n\ntemperature-salinity combinations, suggesting an interaction \n\nbetween these factors. These results highlight the possible \n\ninfluence of temperature on each element\u2019s availability. Another \n\naspect is the fact that at 17\u00b0 C larval seem to find optimum \n\nconditions for its development and for carbonate shell secretion, \n\nhaving a higher incorporation of the elements from the water. Cu \n\nincorporation, however, was not significantly affected by \n\ntemperature or salinity. With regard to the Zn these effects were \n\nsignificant only when not interacting. Finally, the availability of the \n\nlastly mentioned elements in the water was not significant for \n\nelemental concentrations in shells, suggesting that certain \n\nelements incorporation might be specifically controlled by \n\nphysiological mechanisms of the organism. Results obtained allow \n\nunderstanding in more detail the influence some environmental \n\nfactors have on geochemical signature production in mussel larval \n\nshells of this species and may contribute to a better use of \n\nelemental fingerprinting in the interpretation of connectivity \n\npatterns. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n1 \n \n\nContents \n1.

Introduction  \n\nCarbonate structures, such as otoliths, statoliths, and protoconchs of marine \n\norganisms work as an archive of chemical and physical environmental variations \n\nexperienced during growth (Vander Putten et al.  2000; Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl, \n\n2005; Becker et al. 2005). In association with specific environmental conditions non-\n\ncalcium water elements are usually incorporated by the newly formed biogenic \n\ncarbonate, leaving an elemental fingerprint (Thorrold et al. 2002; Becker et al. 2005). \n\nThese signatures may be used to relate an isolated individual to its natal origin, \n\nworking as a natural tag (Becker et al.  2005), and to investigate population \n\nconnectivity mediated by larval dispersal by tracing a migration pathway (Fodrie et \n\nal.  2011). This can highly contribute to the understanding of marine population\u2019s \n\ndynamics and community structure, species evolution and ecology,  which are of \n\nmajor importance in marine resources management (Becker et al.  2007).   \n\n \n\nMost marine organisms have a bi-phasic life cycle with a pre-settlement \n\nplanktontrophic phase that can last from weeks to months (Becker et al. 2007), \n\nfollowed by a post larval phase, including a juvenile and adult stages. With very little \n\nto non-swimming capacity, larval are transported for several kilometers by ocean \n\ncurrents (Becker et al. 2005) contributing to a highly dispersed and connected \n\ndemography among marine species (Becker et al. 2007; DiBacco&amp;Levin, 2000). \n\nAttention has been given to this factor, and to the effect it has on marine populations \n\nsince the beginning of the century (Hjort, 1914). Currently, it is theorized how marine \n\nspecies survival may even depend on this connectivity and how it can influence \n\nspecies persistence and local biodiversity maintenance (Thorrold et al. 2007 Frodie et \n\nal. 2011). Since most of population\u00b4s  biogeography and abundance is determined \n\nduring this early life stage, knowing how far larval can be transported and which \n\ntrajectories they take might, for example, help managing commercial relevant fish and \n\nshellfish invertebrate stocks, as well as contributing to a more effective design of \n\nmarine reserve networks (DiBacco&amp;Levin, 2000; Thorrold et al. 2007), lead to the \n\nunderstanding of the spread of invasive species and the processes of extinction and \n\nrecolonization (Becker, et al. 2005; Becker, et al. 2007). Therefore, understanding\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nlarval dispersal mechanisms, rates and distances is, nowadays, crucial to determine \n\nMPAs optimal size, location and configuration (Levin, 2006), specially when the \n\nchange of the environmental conditions may induce, in some cases, marine species \n\nredistribution (Sorte et al. 2013).  \n\nHowever, studying larval dispersal and therefore coastal population\u00b4s \n\nconnectivity patterns has been a challenge (Levin et al.2006). Larvae reduced size and \n\nsparse concentration, relatively long planktonic periods of most larval and high \n\nmortality rates are some identified obstacles. Studying methods have included from \n\ntraditional approaches like visual tracking (direct observation) and sampling routines \n\n(net tows sampling, settlement collectors) (Queiroga et al. 1994; Dibbaco and Levin, \n\n2000; Levin and Largier, 2003; Thorrold et al., 2007) to more complex such as \n\nhydrographic, behavior and energetic modeling, physical transport mechanisms and \n\ntagging techniques based on geochemical composition(Levin, 1990; Levin, 2006).  \n\nThe geochemical composition of calcified structures of marine organisms \n\nbased on geographical differences in water chemistry is increasingly being employed \n\nas a strategic tool to discriminate among source populations and understand \n\nconnectivity patterns (Thorrold 2007; Lopez-Duarte et al. 2012; Carson et al. 2013). \n\nThis natural tagging method follows the idea that physical and chemical conditions \n\nunder which larval grow are recorded into their carbonate parts through its \n\ngeochemical composition (Becker et al. 2005). At different water masses trace \n\nelements are incorporated in marine organism\u00b4s soft and hard tissues creating a \n\nchemical signature imprinted into mineral structures (Campana, 1999). This trace \n\nmetal/calcium ratio signature can be related back to the location (or locations) where \n\nit was formed (Campana et al. 1994; Dibacco and Levin, 2000; Thorrold et al. 2002). \n\nHowever, an accurate use of elemental fingerprints as larval source identification \n\ndepends on how different environmental conditions experienced at the several \n\nlocations and on how stable are they over time (Thorrold et al. 2002; Becker et al. \n\n2007) so that consistent spatial variations can be registered in the element \n\ncomposition (Zacherl et al. 2003). For instance, more geochemical tag studies have \n\nbeen undertaken using estuarine species than using open-coast species,  most \n\nprobably because in the ocean temperature, salinity and water chemistry variations \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nare less substantial (Becker et al 2007; Lopez-Duarte et al 2012; Carson et al. 2013). \n\nTherefore, the identification of geochemical differences in pelagic larval spawned in \n\nopen coasts and consequently a rigorous determination of spatial and temporal \n\nscales, are problems still to overcome (Becker et al. 2007; Thorrold et al. 2007).  \n\n \n\nAs it is referred, biogenic carbonate structures \u201cuse\u201d chemical elements found \n\nin the water to build their own composition during development.  However , this \n\nincorporation is intrinsically related and influenced by a range of environmental and \n\nbiological  factors including temperature, salinity, dissolved ion concentration in \n\nseawater, oxygen levels, nutrient loads, precipitation rate, ontogenetic characteristics \n\nand seasonal variations in animal\u00b4s physiology (Vander Puten et al. 2000; Zacherel et \n\nal.2003; Strasser, 2008). Comprehending how each factor can influence chemistry \n\nsignature formation is fundamental to a correct study using elemental fingerprinting \n\nin larval dispersal studies (Strasser et al. 2008).  \n\nThe first geochemical tagging studies ever made with hard tissues were \n\napplied to fish otoliths (ear-stones), though it was rapidly extended to statoliths and \n\nprodissoconchs, (larval aragonite shell  segregated during embryonic development) \n\n(Thorrold et al. 2007). Several are the results successfully achieved in population \n\nstudies using elemental fingerprinting, particularly in fish (Strasser et al. 2008). In \n\nmollusks, on the other hand, and especially in bivalves, studies developed are yet \n\nscarce (e.g. Becker et al. 2005, 2007; Carson, 2010a; 2010b). More recently, Fodrie et \n\nal. 2011 has investigated temporal patterns in two mussel species shells settling in \n\none exposed region and one protected bay. Although mussels are commonly used as \n\nenvironmental quality indicators due to their wide geographic distribution and \n\nresistance to a broad range of environmental conditions (Vander Putten et al. 2000), \n\nvery few studies have been carried out on their larval ecology (Strasser et al. 2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n1.1Geochemical signatures formation \n\n  \n\nTrace elements in seawater have two major external sources: 1) atmospheric, \n\nanthropogenic or riverine input and 2) as a result of interactions between seawater \n\nand the newly formed oceanic basalt crust (Nriagu 1989; Donat &amp; Bruland, 1995). \n\nMost of these elements are widely found in nature (Schroeder et al. 1966a; 1966b; \n\n1967) hence its requirement for living organisms basic functioning (e.g. protein \n\nbiological activity which is the case of enzyme cofactors Zn, Cu and Mn) (Singh et al. \n\n2011). \n\n \n\nCarbonate skeletons from hard corals and crustaceans (Finlay et al. 2011), mollusc \n\nshells and fish otoliths (Campana et al. 1994) are built through the deposition of \n\ncalcium carbonate (CaCO3), its main component (Campana et al. 1994; Campana et al. \n\n1999). This compound can be found in aquatic systems as dissolved calcium ions are \n\ngained by the dissolution of minerals and rocks (e.g. silicates and carbonates) and \n\ncarbonate ions are usually introduced by  sources such as carbonate minerals, organic \n\nmatter, atmospheric carbon dioxide and CO2 with volcanic origin (Dietzel et al. 2004). \n\nContrarly to other calcified structures, otoliths, statoliths and larval shells do not \n\nchange the composition through growth (Campana et al. 1994). That\u2019s what makes \n\nthese structures such success in paleoclimatic studies as recorders of environmental \n\nconditions (Carr\u00e9 et al.2006).  \n\nConcerning mussels, through water filtration, the carbonate element is deposited in \n\nthe organism tissues whilst production of specific proteins will form the first \n\naragonite-based shell (Gossling, 2004). At the same time, during this mineralization \n\nprocess, other elements available in the water are incorporated together with calcium \n\nthat forms the skeletal structure of the animal (Richardson et al. 2001).  \n\n \n\nIn general, bivalve shell segregation starts a few hours after fertilization, during the \n\ntrochophore larval stage, the first of several planktonic stages (Figure 1) (Weiss et al. \n\n1992). However, several authors (De Aguirre, 1975; Lutz and Kennish, 1992; Ruiz et \n\nal. 2008) have verified that in mussels this process can actually start under veliger \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nform, which is the second stage.  During this process, a specialized group of \n\nectodermal cells, the shell field, from the dorsal region of the embryo, secretes the \n\nshell gland. Subsequently, the outer mantle cells secrete a second and the outer most \n\norganic shell layer \u2013 the periostracum. In an \n\ninside-out process, the shell gland everts and \n\nbecomes the larval mantle tissue while the \n\nperiostracum spans the whole surface (Weiss \n\net al. 1992; Gosling, 2004). This shell is called \n\nprodissoconch I and continues enlarging until \n\nthe organism is able to close both valves. The \n\nproduction of prodissoconch II then follows \n\nand lasts until the last and third mobile stage, \n\nthe pediveliger. Once the larval phase finishes \n\nthe juvenile shell is called dissoconch but protoconchs I and II remain integrated into \n\njuvenile and adult shells as structurally distinguishable components (Weiss et al. \n\n1992; Ruiz et al. 2008).    \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Factors influencing elements\u00b4 incorporation \n\n \n\nBiogenic carbonate composition has been extensively used for paleo-environmental \n\nstudies (Pilkey and Goodell, 1963). Although it is known that trace metal absorption \n\nis partially controlled by a wide range of environmental, biological and \n\nphysiological/genetic factors, only  recently have we been able to  understand how \n\neach of these contribute to variability in microchemistry signatures(Strasser et al. \n\n2008). Physical and chemical parameters such as temperature and salinity have been \n\nthe most investigated factors over the years. \n\nIn fish otoliths and invertebrate statoliths, studies concerning temperature and \n\nsalinity effect are numerous (Fowler et al. 1995; Elsdon and Gillanders, 2002; Martin \n\net al. 2004; Martin and Thorrrold, 2005; Zacherl et al., 2003b and Zacherl, 2005). \n\nStudies using bivalve shells have been growing over the years (e.g. Dodd, 1965; Dodd, \n\n1967; Lerman, 1965; Lorens and Bender, 1980; Vander Putten, 2000; Lazareth et al., \n\n2003; Strasser et al. 2008). By studying elemental signatures in larval and juvenile \n\nFigure 1 - Three day old larvae shells \u2013 I \u2013 \nprotoconch I, II \u2013 protoconch II.  Weiss et al. 2002 \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nclam shells, Strasser (2008) was able to distinguish effects of temperature, salinity \n\nand age. It was found that the first two factors significantly influenced shell chemistry \n\nof the organisms. However, the authors highlighted that other physiological factors \n\ncan create some confusion when interpreting elemental composition in carbonate \n\nstructures.  \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\n \n\nGeochemical tags are today undeniably important for larval tracking and general \n\nmarine ecology studies. This dissertation focuses on the larval planktonic shells \n\n(prodissoconches) of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, an ecological and \n\neconomically relevant species. This study aims to contribute to a better \n\ncomprehension of trace elements\u00b4 incorporation in relation to conditions of \n\ntemperature, salinity, age and element\u00b4s concentration. The general objective is to \n\nunderstand the variability of elemental microchemistry composition of the larval \n\nshells in order to optimize its use as an elemental fingerprinting technique. For such \n\npurpose, a set of laboratory experiments were conducted where these organisms \n\nwere submitted to constrained conditions of temperature, salinity, trace metals load \n\nand time. Effects of these parameters in concentrations of Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, Sr and Zn \n\nrelative to Ca concentration in D-veliger stage shells were analyzed using ICP-MS \n\n(Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry).  \n\n \n\nThree approaches were undertaken:  \n\n \n\n? Firstly, larval were reared for 14 days under the same temperature and \n\nsalinity level. \n\n? Secondly, mussel larvae were reared under different temperature and salinity \n\ntreatments for 6 days. \n\n? Thirdly, 26h reared larval were incubated into different concentrations of Cu \n\nand Zn at 17\u00b0C and salinity 32. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n1.3 Research questions \n\n \n\nElements Intake  \n\nBeing able to travel for several kilometers transported by ocean currents, individual \n\nlarva experience different environmental conditions, such as the ones selected for \n\nthis work. How do these different conditions affect the elemental signature creation \n\nin mussel prodissoconches is the major question of this thesis. Some of the guiding \n\nquestions throughout this work should be:  \n\n \n\n- In which proportions are elements being incorporated? \n\n- In which way are the different temperatures influencing incorporation?  \n\n- Is the increased availability of certain elements in higher salinity waters \n\ndetermining the deposition? Or are there other physiological factors \n\ndetermining the incorporation? \n\n- Are there differences related to larval age? \n\n \n\nElements\u00b4 availability  \n\nTrace elements are found in aquatic systems abundantly, emerging from different \n\nknown and unknown sources. A second major question is how different \n\navailabilities in the environment affect metal incorporation rate and consequently \n\ntheir contribution for shell-element signatures. \n\n \n\n- What is the elements\u00b4 incorporation rate according to each added \n\nconcentration?  \n\n- Whilst having more availability is also noticed higher incorporation?  \n\n- How is it found larval development at the different metal concentrations \n\ntreatments? \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods  \n\n2.1 Larvae rearing  \n\nTemperature and salinity  \n\nAdult Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected from Mira channel in the Ria de \n\nAveiro and transported to the lab where they were cleaned and prepared for \n\nspawning induction.  Mussel individuals were placed in plastic containers with \n\nartificial seawater. Thermal shock method was the most appropriate one for gamete \n\nrelease and several shifts of ~20 minutes of low temperature (3-4\u00b0C) and high \n\ntemperature (22-25\u00b0C) took place. Both gametes were obtained in different glass \n\ncontainers and later passed through 40\u00b5m mesh filters and coupled. Fertilized eggs \n\nwere filtered using the previous method and transferred to a new acid leached glass \n\ncontainer where sub samples of 250?l were collected for counting and estimation of \n\nthe stoking culture. \n\n Approximately 16000 trochophore larvae with few hours were placed into \n\neach of the thirty-six 1 liter acid leached glasses. The larval containers were divided \n\namong 12 treatments that combine 4 temperatures (12, 17, 20 and 25\u00b0C) and 3 \n\nsalinities (26, 32 and 37) in a factorial design with 3 replicates per treatment. \n\nExperiments room was kept at a 17\u00b0C temperature so it could be maintained the \n\ntemperature of the third treatment. Water baths were created for three of the \n\ntreatments. Aquarium water heaters were used for the 20 and 25\u00b0C treatments while \n\nfor the 12\u00b0C treatment a cooler bath system was used. Temperature was continuously \n\nregulated by tank thermometers. Each larval container was covered with paraffin \n\nplastic and an air system was installed to provide oxygen to all rearing larvae. \n\nArtificial seawater was obtained in laboratory by adding sea salt minerals to \n\nosmosis water (purified water by a reverse osmosis). Salinity was reduced for the \n\nlow-salinity treatment by adding osmosis water and increased for the high-salinity \n\ntreatment by adding artificial seawater. Water was filtered to exclude major \n\ncontaminants and impurities and maintained in 5 liters water jugs for the whole time \n\nof the experiments. \n\nLarvae were raised for 6 days under selected conditions except for one \n\ncombination of temperature/salinity -17\u00b0C and 32 \u2013 where larvae were raised for 14 \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\ndays. Water changes were executed every 3 days by filtering larval individuals with \n\n40 ?m filter meshes and depositing them in containers with new prepared and \n\nfiltered artificial seawater. Larvae were fed Isochrysis galbana every 3 days, having all \n\ngoblets received 5ml with a larval density of ?20 000/L. Subsamples of 250\u00b5l of \n\nmussel larvae were collected for mortality and growth estimation from each \n\ncontainer at each water change. Therefore organisms\u00b4 development was monitored \n\nand by the third day of experiment larvae were D-veliger stage and by the sixth, \n\nvelum well developed veliger stage. At the 6th and 14th day (for the 17\u00baC 32 \n\ntreatment) a sample of ? 1000 individuals per replicate were stored in acid leached \n\nEppendorf tubes and frozen until sample processing.  \n\nElemental availability  \n\nTwo trace metals, Cu and Zn, were used to compare its incorporation, in larval \n\nshells, under different environmental concentrations during 60 hours. Approximately, \n\n14000 larvae with 26h of development were distributed over 18 1l bakers of 3 \n\ntreatments of Cu [0; 1; 5] ?g/l and 3 treatments of Zn [0; 5; 10] ?g/l with 3 replicates \n\neach. Stock solutions were prepared by adding a possible weighed concentration of \n\neach metal to 1 liter of filtered artificial seawater. Dilutions were made for each \n\ntreatment. Room temperature was kept at 17\u00b0C.  \n\n 2.2 Sample preparation  \n\nWater preparation \n\nWater stock solutions for every salinity and element\u00b4s availability treatment \n\nwere analyzed throughout the experiments for chemical composition. Sub samples of \n\n900?l of each water salinity level (with three replicates each) were preserved with \n\n100 ?l of Ultrapure 60% nitric acid (HNO?) and stored in acid leached 1,5ml ependorf \n\ntubes, at every water change, and stored at 4 \u00b0C until microchemistry analysis.  \n\nLarval shell preparation \n\nLarva shell preparation followed Strasser et al. 2008 protocol. Each larva \n\nsample containing a \u201cpool\u201d of no more than 1000 larval individuals was defrosted and \n\ncleaned from organic matter. Using Petri plastic dishes, larvae \u201cpools\u201d were soaked in \n\na solution of Suprapur hydrogen peroxyde (H?O?) 30% buffered with Suprapur \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nsodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 10 minutes to allow organic matter digestion and \n\nrinsed three times with Mili-Q water for larval shell  decontamination before analysis. \n\nUsing 40?m mesh filters larvae \u201cpools\u201d were filtered and transferred with a \n\nmicropipette to acid leached 1, 5 ml ependorf tubes. Fluid excess was collected using \n\na micropipette and 10?l of HNO? 60% was added to each ependorfs to dissolve shells \n\nfor ICP-MS analyses.  \n\n2.3 ICP-MS analysis \n\nBoth water and larval shell samples were analyzed for concentrations of barium (Ba), \n\ncalcium (Ca), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr) and zinc \n\n(Zn) by the Central Analytical Laboratory at the University of Aveiro.  Selected \n\nelements for this study were already reported in previous studies, developed in \n\nlaboratory, as having an interaction with temperature and salinity (Martin and \n\nThorrold, 2005; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Strasser et al.2008) Ba, Mg, Mn and Sr and as \n\nsuccessful proxies in tagging methods (Carson et al.2013). \n\nConcentrations were determined with a Thermo X Series Inductively Coupled Plasma \n\n\u2013 Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS), equipped with a Burgener Mira Mist nebulizer, set up \n\nwith a Peltier conical cooled chamber, quartz torch and silver shielded nickel cones, \n\ncoupled to a Cetax ASX-510 auto sampler. Indium (In) and Terbium (Tb) were used as \n\ninternal standards and the CeO/Ce ratio was kept below&lt;2%. The concentrations \n\nof 48Ca, 24Mg and 88Sr were determined by a Jobin Yvon Activa M Inductively Coupled \n\nPlasma \u2013 Optical Omission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) equipped with a JY-AS500 auto \n\nsampler and a Burgener Mira Mist nebulizer. \n\n \n\n2.4 Statistical analysis   \n\n Statistical routines were undertaken using software Statistica. Trace elemental \n\nconcentrations of larval shells were standardized and ratios between each element \n\nand calcium (E: Ca) were calculated for data analysis. All ratio data was log \n\nnormalized to correct for heteroscedasticity (heterogenity in error variance). \n\nSeawater chemical concentrations were interpreted through a linear regression as \n\nonly the factor salinity was investigated for its effect in the different water \n\ntreatments. Concentrations of trace elements in ratio to the amount of Ca were then \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nsubmitted to a factorial analysis of variance, factorial ANOVA, to explore the effects of \n\ntemperature and salinity and the factors combined interaction on the incorporation \n\nof different elements. Tukey\u00b4s test was used as a post-hoc test. The effect of Cu and Zn \n\nconcentration in the water under constant temperature (17\u00b0C) and salinity (32) was \n\nalso tested with an ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons made using Tukey\u2019s test.  \n\nFinally, the effect of age (6 and 14 day old) on the incorporation of different element: \n\nCa at constant temperature (17\u00b0C) and salinity (32) was analyzed with a t-test.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nFigure 1- Mean seawater elemental concentrations of 26, 32 and 37 salinity treatments.

Results  \n\n3.1 Temperature and Salinity effect \n\nWater chemical composition \n\nSeawater chemical composition for all elements varied among the tested salinity \n\ntreatments, following an increasing trend as a function of salinity level (Fig 1). \n\nIncrement was significant for all the seven elements as significant regressions \n\nconfirm (Fig 1; p<0, 05). Zn concentrations in ultrapure Mili-Q water showed high \n\nconcentrations of this metal (4 orders of magnitude higher than in salt water) \n\nsuggesting contamination of deionized water sample. Therefore, those samples were \n\nnot integrated in the analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSalinity \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nLarval shells  \n\nBy the third day of the current experiment the 25\u00b0C treatment showed a larval \n\nmortality rate of nearly 100% which made this treatment no longer available for the \n\nstudy.  \n\nTemperature and salinity treatments showed to have a significant effect in all \n\nelements incorporation except for Cu (Table 1). Regarding temperature effect on \n\nconcentrations of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca, a common pattern was \n\ndetected where the maximum incorporation is reached at 17C (Figure 2). While at \n\n12C and 20C treatments incorporations were significantly lower. Although Cu/Ca also \n\nshows maximum incorporation at 17 C, the concentration was not significantly \n\ndifferent from the other two temperature treatments.  \n\nSalinity also has a common effect on all the incorporation ratios according to the \n\nincreasing trend observed on the elemental concentrations in the water (Figure 1).

Discussion \n\n4.1 Temperature and salinity effect \n\nIn this dissertation was investigated how temperature, salinity, elemental availability \n\nand age can influence variability in geochemical signatures in larval mussel shells. \n\nFirstly, the effect of temperature, salinity and the interaction of both factors were \n\nanalyzed. It was found that the uptake of all the studied elements (barium, copper, \n\nmagnesium, manganese, strontium and zinc) was affected by temperature and \n\nsalinity and also found an interaction between both factors for most of the elements. \n\nThe incorporation of Cu seemed to be the least affected by temperature, salinity and \n\ntheir interaction, while the uptake of Zn and Mn was not significant when considering \n\nfactors\u00b4 interaction. \n\nAs expected, elemental incorporations increased with increasing salinity due to a \n\nhigher availability of elements in the water (Figure 3). But when considering \n\ntemperature, we see the highest elemental incorporation at 17\u00b0C (Figure 2) and the \n\nlowest incorporation at lower and higher temperature levels. These results may \n\nsuggest the influence of temperature in element\u00b4s availability in the water allowing \n\ndifferent concentrations of these at different temperature levels. This is also \n\nsupported by the interaction of salinity and temperature where it is seen a maximum \n\nincorporation for each element at different temperature-salinity treatment pairs \n\n(Figure 4). On the other hand, although higher temperatures, in general, increase \n\ngrowth and reduce pelagic larval duration (Ruiz et al. 2008) also show detrimental \n\neffects on physiological status and survival over certain thresholds (S\u00e1nchez-Lazo \n\nand Mart\u00ednez-Pita 2012). Although temperatures around 20C have been reported as \n\noptimum for mussel larval development (Ruiz et al. 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Lazo and \n\nMart\u00ednez-Pita, 2012), a decrease in survival was also observed for temperatures over \n\n24\u00b0C (S\u00e1nchez-Lazo and Mart\u00ednez-Pita 2012), in agreement with our results for the \n\n25\u00b0C treatment where 100% mortality was observed.  \n\nThe decrease of elemental incorporation in larval shells at higher temperatures may \n\ncorrespond to a physiological response to stress where elemental incorporation may \n\noccur at a slower rate as larvae metabolism is affected. On the other hand, the \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\ndecrease incorporations in larval shells at higher temperatures might not be directly \n\nrelated with survival or physiological stress but with other mechanisms directly \n\nrelated with shell segregation, with an optimum for element incorporation around \n\n17\u00b0C. \n\n \n\nMagnesium uptake \n\nResults show that magnesium uptake in larval shells was significantly influenced by \n\ntested condition. Mg/Ca show an interaction between temperature and salinity, \n\nalthough incorporation increases with salinity there is a general lower incorporation \n\nat higher temperatures (Figure 4). Studies of bivalve aragonite and calcite larval \n\nshells haven\u2019t been consistent about the relation of Mg with temperature. Early \n\nstudies with M. edulis (Dodd, 1965; Vander Putten, 2000) found that Mg \n\nconcentrations in calcite shells increased with temperature. Lorens and Bender \n\n(1980) though, had already theorized that, regarding Mg in Mytilus edulis, the first \n\nshould be regulated by mantle cells during calcite formation but not during aragonite \n\nformation. Although, more recent results from Strasser 2008 support a weak \n\ninfluence of temperature and salinity in Mg levels in both aragonite and calcite shells \n\nof Mya arenaria, the obtained results in this thesis can support temperature influence \n\non Mg incorporation in mussel aragonite shells. \n\nManganese and Zinc uptake \n\nSalinity and temperature seemed to contribute to Mn and Zn concentration variation \n\nin the larval shells but no interaction was observed between both factors (Figure2 \n\nand 3; Table 1) Elsdon and Gillanders (2003) that obtained no significant effects of \n\nsalinity or temperature in Mn concentrations in laboratory reared fish otoliths \n\njustified these results by concluding that biological processes should be involved in \n\nMn mediation in those structures.  Still, Mn has been used successfully for other \n\nelemental tagging studies (e.g. Thorrold et al. 2001; Becker et al.2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nBarium and Strontium uptake \n\nSignificant effect of temperature and salinity was found in both Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca \n\nconcentrations in mussel larval shells. Incorporations followed a decreasing trend as \n\na function of temperature and an increasing one with salinity level (Figure 2 and 3). \n\nConcerning Ba, these results agree with previous studies. Zacherl (2002) found a \n\nnegative correlation between temperature and this element\u00b4s incorporation into \n\naragonite statoliths of Kalletia kalletii, as well as Bath et al. 2000 in fish otoliths, \n\nZacherl et al. 2003b in statoliths and Strasser et al. 2008 in mollusc shells. With \n\nexception of the last, the above referred studies have also confirmed a positive \n\nrelation of Ba/Ca in calcified structures with Ba/Ca in the seawater (Zumholz, 2007), \n\nbeing also in agreement with obtained results in this work. \n\nRegarding Sr, studies have defended that Sr incorporation in aragonite shells of \n\nmolluscs are dependable on precipitation rate (Takesue and van Geen, 2004), while \n\nspecifically in bivalve shells Sr/Ca ratios are mainly regulated by biological processes \n\nand not by thermodynamics (Gilikin et al. 2005). \n\nCopper uptake \n\nCopper was the element which showed to be the least affected by the tested \n\nconditions. No significant differences of Cu/Ca ratios were detected in larval shells \n\nbetween the different tested temperature and salinity levels. One interpretation for \n\nthis case is that Cu incorporation might be highly regulated by the organisms during \n\nshell formation due to its high toxicity level (Beiras and Albentosa, 2004; Nadella et \n\nal.2009). \n\n \n\n4.2 Age effect \n\nMussel larvae reared to evaluate age effect on elemental incorporations showed no \n\nsignificant differences in elemental ratios between the two development stages (6 \n\nand 14 days). This leads to the conclusion that during the first 14 days of larval \n\ndevelopment of Mytilus galloprovincialis there were no significant ontogenetic \n\nvariations of water elemental incorporations and, therefore, geochemical signature \n\nremained stable during this time. This way, shell chemical signature obtained has a \n\nhigher probability of being a good representative of water chemical composition.  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nThese results exclude the possible influence of time in geochemical signature \n\nvariation during the tested period, and confirm elemental fingerprinting as a reliable \n\ntechnique to represent original water masses as most of in situ studies incubate \n\nlarvae for a period of 4-7 days. \n\nOn a bigger scale, considering connectivity between populations, elemental \n\nfingerprinting gains importance if this method can distinguish different water masses \n\nindependently of the development stage of the organism.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Elemental availability effect \n\nCopper and zinc concentrations in larval shells, according to current experimental \n\nresults, proved to be the least affected by temperature and salinity. Aiming to \n\nunderstand if the incorporation of these elements in aragonite shells varies with \n\nanother environmental factor, elemental availability was tested and mussel larvae \n\nwere submitted to different levels of Cu and Zn. \n\nCu/Ca ratios showed no significant variance according to the level of Cu/Ca in the \n\nenvironmental water. Concerning Zn/Ca ratios, at higher water concentrations it is \n\nseen a significant decrease of incorporation in larval shells.   Results may suggest that \n\nthe uptake of these elements it is not controlled by environmental factors but \n\nintrinsically in the organism.  \n\nMetal toxicity in marine organisms has been reported in several studies and more \n\nrecently in bivalves by Beiras &amp; Albentosa (2004) and Nadella et al. (2009). According \n\nto the first study, among the tested metal range (including Zn, Co, Hg, Pb and Cd) Cu \n\nwas the second most toxic element and the one with the highest risk factor for two \n\nspecies, including Mytilus galloprovincialis. Zn followed as the most toxic metal after \n\nCu.  In the second experiment, copper and Zn were considered the most toxic metals \n\n(compared with Zn, Ni e Cd) on Mytilus trossolus when analysed embryo \n\ndevelopment. \n\nBiological factors regulating Cu and Zn uptake in aragonite shells may represent a \n\nphysiological response to stress conditions. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n5. Conclusions  \n\nInterest in elemental fingerprinting as a tool to detect larval dispersal and \n\nconnectivity patterns among populations has been growing due to its successful use \n\nin the latter years. The present work originated results that contribute to the \n\ncomprehension of how trace elements are incorporated in the larval shells of Mytilus \n\ngalloprovincialis being influenced by temperature, salinity, elemental composition of \n\nthe environment and age of the organisms.  \n\nA significant influence of temperature and salinity, for most of the tested elements, \n\nand a non significant influence from elemental availability and age are verified. \n\nSalinity significantly contributes to a higher availability of elements in the water and \n\nin the shells and its interaction with temperature is also significant for most of the \n\nelements. Moreover the effect temperature has in larval physiological processes \n\nregulation such as growth rate, planktonik periods, shell secretion and mortality is \n\nperhaps the main explanation for such incorporations according to temperature \n\nlevels. Nonetheless, regarding age effect, results validate the importance of elemental \n\nfingerprinting in origin determination of larvae, in studies with a similar time range, \n\nas it is supported a consistency in chemical signature according to larval development \n\nstage. The different availability levels of Cu and Zn in water proved to be not \n\nsignificant in chemical signatures formation in larval shells. These were also the less \n\nvariable elements found in shells with the effect of temperature and salinity which \n\nmay reflect that its adherence was strongly regulated by other factors. Biological \n\nfactors are here suggested as it is found in literature studies demonstrating these \n\nelements toxicity in mussel embryos.  \n\nMore knowledge of the different factors conditioning elements uptake in carbonate \n\nstructures is required for a more accurate interpretation and use of geochemical \n\nsignatures in natal habitat identification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nReferences \n\nBath G.E., Thorrold S.R., Jones C.M., Campana S.E, McLaren J.W. and.
