The effect of MG on the protection of model proteins against \n\nheat-induced denaturation and aggregation has been amply demonstrated in vitro. \n\nThese characteristics make MG a valuable compound in biotechnological applications. \n\nHowever, the practical application of MG is hampered by the high production cost.  \n\nIn this work, we engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of MG. Two \n\nstrains (VSY71 and CEN.PK2) and several carbon sources were examined to optimize \n\nthe production of MG. Using glucose as carbon source, the strain VSY71 accumulated \n\n90 \u00b5mol MG/g of dry mass, an increase of 2-fold compared with strain CEN.PK2. The \n\neffect of several carbon sources (sucrose, mannose, galactose and raffinose) on MG \n\nproduction by strain VSY71 was also investigated. Synthesis of MG (28.1 \u00b5mol/g of dry \n\nmass) was detected with sucrose only. In addition to the biotechnological importance of \n\nbeing a MG producer, this strain can serve as a platform to assess protein stabilization \n\nby osmolytes in vivo. Therefore, we used it to evaluate the effect of MG on the \n\naggregating-prone protein, ?-synuclein (?-Syn). For that, the S. cerevisiae strain \n\nVSY72, harboring two copies of ?-Syn-EGFP integrated in the genome, was \n\nengineered to synthesize MG. As a control, a mutant transformed with the empty \n\nMG-plasmid was also constructed. The accumulation of MG (20 \u00b5mol/g of dry mass) \n\nprior to ?-Syn over-production clearly reduced the formation of inclusions of this \n\nprotein; moreover, the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by ?-Syn over-\n\nproduction decreased in the MG-producing strain. Additionally, when MG accumulation \n\nwas induced in cells harboring large inclusions of ?-Syn there was an effective \n\nsolubilization of these forms. This work clearly shows that MG inhibits the aggregation \n\nof ?-Syn and promotes the solubilization of ?-Syn inclusions in vivo. \n\n\n\n \niii \n\n \n\nResumo  \n \nMicrorganismos adaptados a proliferar optimamente em ambientes com temperatura \n\nelevada s\u00e3o designados term\u00f3filos ou hiperterm\u00f3filos, consoante a temperatura \u00f3ptima \n\nde crescimento se situa entre 60\u00baC e 80\u00baC ou acima de 80\u00baC, respectivamente. Estes \n\norganismos t\u00eam sido isolados a partir de amostras de zonas geotermais, quer \n\nterrestres quer marinhas, superficiais ou de profundidade, bem como de ambientes \n\naquecidos artificialmente. \n\nTal como a maioria dos microrganismos halof\u00edlicos ou halotolerantes, os \n\nmicrorganismos termof\u00edlicos e hipertermof\u00edlicos provenientes de ambientes marinhos \n\nacumulam compostos org\u00e2nicos denominados \u201csolutos compat\u00edveis\u201d para \n\ncontrabalan\u00e7ar a press\u00e3o osm\u00f3tica exterior. S\u00e3o mol\u00e9culas de baixa massa molecular, \n\ncom elevada solubilidade em \u00e1gua e que podem atingir concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas no \n\ninterior das c\u00e9lulas (da ordem de 1 M) sem interferirem negativamente com as fun\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncelulares. Para al\u00e9m da sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o na adapta\u00e7\u00e3o a flutua\u00e7\u00f5es na osmolaridade do \n\nmeio exterior, alguns destes solutos s\u00e3o preferencialmente acumulados em resposta a \n\ntemperaturas supra-\u00f3ptimas. Al\u00e9m disso, os solutos t\u00edpicos de (hiper)term\u00f3filos s\u00e3o \n\nquimicamente diferentes dos que geralmente s\u00e3o encontrados em organismos \n\nmesof\u00edlicos, nomeadamente no que se refere \u00e0 carga el\u00e9ctrica da mol\u00e9cula que \u00e9 \n\nnegativa nos primeiros e neutra nos segundos. Este conjunto de observa\u00e7\u00f5es levou \u00e0 \n\nhip\u00f3tese de que os solutos compat\u00edveis de (hiper)term\u00f3filos desempenhariam um \n\npapel relevante na protec\u00e7\u00e3o de componentes celulares contra os efeitos \n\ndesnaturantes provocados por temperaturas elevadas. \n\nManosilglicerato \u00e9 um dos solutos compat\u00edveis mais frequentemente encontrado em \n\nmicrorganismos adaptados a ambientes quentes. Foi identificado inicialmente em \n\nRhodothermus marinus, uma bact\u00e9ria termof\u00edlica isolada de uma nascente geotermal \n\ndos A\u00e7ores, mas posteriormente foi detectado em muitos outros (hiper)term\u00f3filos \n\n(trabalho da nossa equipa). A maioria dos organismos estudados acumula este soluto \n\nem resposta a stress osm\u00f3tico, no entanto acumula\u00e7\u00e3o em resposta a stress t\u00e9rmico \n\ntem sido observada em alguns casos. Ensaios in vitro com prote\u00ednas modelo \n\nmostraram que manosilglicerato actua como estabilizador, exibindo capacidade \n\ntermoprotectora muito superior \u00e0 da trealose, um soluto caracter\u00edstico de organismos \n\n\n\n \niv \n\nmesofilos. Manosilglicerato tem-se revelado um excelente protector da estrutura de \n\nprote\u00ednas, impedindo a sua desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o e subsequente agrega\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como a \n\nperda de actividade no caso de enzimas. Por estas raz\u00f5es, o manosilglicerato tem \n\ngrande potencialidade de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, nomeadamente na ind\u00fastria cosm\u00e9tica, como \n\nhidratante e protector solar, na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de vacinas durante armazenamento e \n\ntransporte, como estabilizador de enzimas em \u201ckits\u201d cl\u00ednicos e anal\u00edticos e na \n\nestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas usadas em biosensores. Em particular, manosilglicerato \n\naumenta o tempo de vida de vectores retrovirais e melhora a sensibilidade em \n\nmetodologias com microgrelhas de DNA. Trata-se portanto de um composto valioso \n\nsob o ponto de vista biotecnol\u00f3gico. Contudo, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de manosilglicerato \u00e9 \n\nactualmente um processo altamente dispendioso, uma vez que o seu isolamento \u00e9 \n\nrealizado a partir da biomassa de um produtor natural, Rhodothermus marinus, que \n\nacumula apenas 15 g por kg de biomassa h\u00famida (resultados n\u00e3o publicados). Neste \n\ncontexto, torna-se premente o desenvolvimento de um produtor industrial de \n\nmanosilglicerato de modo a conseguir custos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o competitivos.  \n\nA estrat\u00e9gia mais promissora envolver\u00e1 necessariamente a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica de \n\numa estirpe industrial (nomeadamente, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, \n\nBacillus subtilis) de modo a dot\u00e1-la com a capacidade para produzir manosilglicerato \n\nem larga escala. Esta tarefa \u00e9 exequ\u00edvel visto que os genes envolvidos na s\u00edntese \n\ndeste composto s\u00e3o conhecidos.    \n\nUm dos objectivos do presente trabalho foi melhorar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de manosilglicerato \n\nusando uma organismo industrial. Para tal seleccionou-se a estirpe S. cerevisiae \n\nVSY71 que foi transformada com o plasm\u00eddeo (p425::mgsD), contendo o gene que \n\ncodifica a enzima bifuncional manosil-3-fosfoglicerato s\u00edntase/fosfatase da bact\u00e9ria \n\nmesof\u00edlica Dehalococcoides ethenogenes. Esta enzima sintetiza manosilglicerato a \n\npartir de GDP-manose e 3-fosfoglicerato. Estrat\u00e9gia id\u00eantica tinha sido anteriormente \n\nseguida usando como hospedeiro a estirpe CEN.PK2 (Empadinhas et al., 2004), pelo \n\nque transform\u00e1mos CEN.PK2 tamb\u00e9m com p425::mgsD e us\u00e1mo-la para fins de \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o de produ\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPara optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de manosilglicerato usou-se S. cerevisiae estirpe \n\nVSY71, contendo o plasm\u00eddeo para a s\u00edntese de manosilglicerato, e testaram-se v\u00e1rias \n\nfontes de carbono e v\u00e1rias salinidades no meio de crescimento. Os substratos \n\nrafinose, manose e galactose n\u00e3o conduziram \u00e0 s\u00edntese de manosilglicerato, apesar \n\nde suportarem crescimento celular ainda que com velocidades de crescimento \n\ninferiores \u00e0s registadas em glucose. C\u00e9lulas cultivadas em sucrose acumularam 28 \n\n\u00b5mol de manosilglicerato por grama de biomassa seca. Produ\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima, 90 \u00b5mol de \n\nmanosilglicerato por grama de biomassa seca, foi observada usando glucose como \n\n\n\n \nv \n\nfonte de carbono. Este valor \u00e9 cerca de duas vezes superior \u00e1 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmanosilglicerato observada com a estirpe S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2. Os resultados \n\nmostram que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de manosilglicerato depende em grande medida da estirpe \n\nutilizada pelo que h\u00e1 todo um trabalho de rastreio de colec\u00e7\u00f5es de S. cerevisiae que \n\nser\u00e1 suscept\u00edvel de conduzir a produ\u00e7\u00f5es de manosilglicerato consideravelmente \n\nsuperiores. Mesmo assim, vale a pena destacar que a estrat\u00e9gia seguida neste \n\ntrabalho conduziu a um melhoramento consider\u00e1vel da produ\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com a estrat\u00e9gia descrita na literatura.  \n\n \n\nUm segundo objectivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a efic\u00e1cia de manosilglicerato na \n\nestabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas in vivo, ou seja, no meio extremamente viscoso e com \n\nelevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o molecular que constitui o citoplasma celular. O esfor\u00e7o investido \n\nneste t\u00f3pico teve uma dupla finalidade: i) encontrar novas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es para \n\nmanosilglicerato, eventualmente relacionadas com abordagens para prevenir \n\nagrega\u00e7\u00e3o proteica induzida por erros no enrolamento de cadeias polipept\u00eddicas; ii) e \n\nobter evid\u00eancia experimental para apoiar a hip\u00f3tese de que manosilglicerato exerce de \n\nfacto um papel protector da estrutura de prote\u00ednas in vivo. Para realizar este objectivo \n\nusou-se um modelo de levedura para a doen\u00e7a de Parkinson, no qual o gene \n\ncodificante da ?-sinucle\u00edna humana (fundido com o gene codificante para uma \n\nprote\u00edna super-fluorescente) foi super-expresso em S. cerevisiae VSY72, onde \n\ntamb\u00e9m foi expresso o gene para a s\u00edntese de manosilglicerato. As c\u00e9lulas \n\nrecombinantes produziram ?-sinucle\u00edna e manosilglicerato, permitindo comparar o \n\nefeito da presen\u00e7a e aus\u00eancia de manosilglicerato na agrega\u00e7\u00e3o de ??sinucle\u00edna em \n\nambiente intracelular.  \n\n?-Sinucle\u00edna \u00e9 uma prote\u00edna encontrada apenas no c\u00e9rebro de mam\u00edferos. Embora a \n\nsua fun\u00e7\u00e3o fisiol\u00f3gica seja desconhecida, sabe-se que est\u00e1 associada a v\u00e1rias \n\ndoen\u00e7as neurodegenerativas (doen\u00e7a de Parkinson entre outras menos comuns) visto \n\nser um dos componentes dos agregados proteicos que caracterizam estas patologias. \n\n??Sinucle\u00edna \u00e9 uma prote\u00edna intrinsecamente desenrolada, isto \u00e9, a forma nativa n\u00e3o \n\ntem estrutura definida. A prote\u00edna tem tend\u00eancia para auto-associa\u00e7\u00e3o formando em \n\nmuitos casos estruturas fibrilares, designadas amil\u00f3ides. Quando produzida na \n\nlevedura S. cerevisiae, por manipula\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica, a ??sinucle\u00edna \u00e9 transportada para \n\na membrana plasm\u00e1tica onde se ancora. A super-produ\u00e7\u00e3o desta prote\u00edna leva \u00e0 \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o, perto da membrana, de pequenas inclus\u00f5es citoplasm\u00e1ticas que aumentam \n\nprogressivamente de tamanho, originando grandes inclus\u00f5es, vis\u00edveis por microscopia \n\nde fluoresc\u00eancia.  \n\n\n\n \nvi \n\nNeste trabalho, us\u00e1mos a estirpe VSY72 que cont\u00e9m duas c\u00f3pias do gene da \n\n??sinucle\u00edna integradas no cromossoma e que foi transformada com o plasm\u00eddeo que \n\ncont\u00e9m o gene que codifica para a s\u00edntese do manosilglicerato. Como controlo foi \n\nusada a estirpe VSY72 transformada com o plasm\u00eddeo vazio. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmanosilglicerato \u00e9 regulada por um promotor constitutivo, enquanto que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n??sinucle\u00edna \u00e9 controlada por um promotor sens\u00edvel \u00e0 galactose. A acumula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nintracelular de manosilglicerato (20 \u00b5mol por grama de biomassa seca) reduziu em 3,5 \n\nvezes o n\u00famero de c\u00e9lulas com inclus\u00f5es de ??sinucle\u00edna, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a \n\nestirpe controlo (incapaz de sintetizar manosilglicerato). Estes resultados referem-se a \n\nc\u00e9lulas examinadas dez horas ap\u00f3s indu\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ??sinucle\u00edna. Tivemos o \n\ncuidado de verificar que as duas estirpes apresentam n\u00edveis semelhantes de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde ??sinucle\u00edna (an\u00e1lises por \u201cwestern blot\u201d). Em paralelo, monitorizaram-se os n\u00edveis \n\nde esp\u00e9cies reactivas de oxig\u00e9nio induzidas pela produ\u00e7\u00e3o excessiva de ??sinucle\u00edna. \n\nOs resultados mostraram que a presen\u00e7a de manosilglicerato no citoplasma causou \n\numa diminui\u00e7\u00e3o no n\u00edvel de esp\u00e9cies reactivas de oxig\u00e9nio em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o \n\ncontrolo. Por outras palavras, ao prevenir a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de inclus\u00f5es de ??sinucle\u00edna, o \n\nmanosilglicerato diminuiu tamb\u00e9m o n\u00edvel de stress oxidativo associado ao processo \n\nde super-express\u00e3o da prote\u00edna, possivelmente promovendo a estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de formas \n\nnativas de ??sinucle\u00edna, supostamente com menor toxicidade para a c\u00e9lula.  \n\nTendo-se demonstrado o efeito inibit\u00f3rio de manosilglicerato na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de inclus\u00f5es \n\nde ??sinucle\u00edna, p\u00f4s-se a quest\u00e3o de saber se este composto teria tamb\u00e9m efeito ao \n\nn\u00edvel da solubiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de inclus\u00f5es pr\u00e9-formadas. Para tal, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ??sinucle\u00edna \n\nfoi induzida nove horas antes da indu\u00e7\u00e3o da s\u00edntese de manosilglicerato, por permuta \n\nde meio contendo galactose para meio fresco contendo glucose como \u00fanica fonte de \n\ncarbono. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que o manosilglicerato tem uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nchaperona molecular, promovendo a desagrega\u00e7\u00e3o das inclus\u00f5es de ??sinucle\u00edna: \n\numa hora ap\u00f3s indu\u00e7\u00e3o da s\u00edntese de manosilglicerato o n\u00famero de inclus\u00f5es vis\u00edveis \n\npor microscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia era 2,8 vezes inferior ao detectado em c\u00e9lulas \n\ncontrolo. \n\nO efeito do manosilglicerato na preven\u00e7\u00e3o/solubiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de inclus\u00f5es de ??sinucle\u00edna \n\npode ser atribu\u00eddo \u00e1 activa\u00e7\u00e3o de mecanismos celulares que conduzem \u00e0 degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde formas anormais de ??sinucle\u00edna, ou que promovem o seu enrolamento correcto. \n\nAlternativamente, o efeito ben\u00e9fico observado pode resultar de uma interac\u00e7\u00e3o directa \n\nsoluto/prote\u00edna que estabilize preferencialmente a estrutura nativa da ??sinucle\u00edna, \n\nprevenindo assim a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de inclus\u00f5es.

Such scalding habitats \n\nare found in terrestrial as well as in shallow or deep-marine geothermal sites (Stetter  \n\n1995). \n\nMicroorganisms with optimum growth temperatures between 65\u00baC and 80\u00baC are \n\nnamed thermophiles, those with optimum growth temperature equal or above 80\u00baC are \n\ndesignated hyperthermophiles (Bl\u00f6chl et al., 1995). Most thermophiles and \n\nhyperthermophiles, herein designated (hyper)thermophiles, belong to the domains \n\nBacteria and Archaea. Actually, the most hyperthermophilic microorganisms known to \n\ndate are found exclusively in the domain Archaea. \n\nAqueous environments are susceptible to fluctuations in the concentrations of salts. \n\nTherefore, microorganism that survive and proliferate in such habitats must adapt to \n\nthe environmental osmolarity to avoid cell lysis (due to excessive water uptake) or \n\ndehydratation due to outflow of water molecules. Two strategies are used by \n\nmicroorganisms to cope with high salt concentration. One of them involves the influx of \n\ninorganic ions, generally KCl, into the cytoplasm and has been designated the \u201csalt-in-\n\nthe-cytoplasm\u201d type of adaptation (Galinski, 1995). The second strategy relies on the \n\naccumulation of small organic compounds to balance the external osmotic pressure. \n\nThese compounds can accumulate to very high levels (molar concentration) inside the \n\ncells without disturbing cellular functions, and for this reason they are called \n\n\u201ccompatible solutes\u201d (Brown, 1976). Besides their major role in osmoadaptation, recent \n\nstudies have shown that compatible solutes act as protectors of cells and cell \n\nstructures against a variety of stresses, like heat, cold, acid, free-radicals or drought. \n\n(da Costa et al., 1998; Arg\u00fcelles, 2000; Welsh, 2000; Benaroudj et al., 2001; Santos &amp; \n\nda Costa, 2001; Cardoso et al., 2004; Kandror et al., 2002; Mahmud et al., 2010).  \n\nThe accumulation of compatible solutes for osmoadaptation is widespread in \n\norganisms, ranging from archaea to bacteria, yeast filamentous fungi, algae, plants and \n\n\n\n \n2 \n\nanimals. Trehalose is widespread in all domains of the Tree of Life; polyols, such as \n\nglycerol, are commonly found in fungi and algae; ectoine or hydroxyectoine seem to be \n\nrestricted to bacteria, while glycine betaine and ?-glutamate are usually found in \n\nbacteria and archaea (da Costa et al., 1998). It is interesting to note the strong \n\nprevalence of neutral or zwitterionic solutes in mesophilic organisms.  \n\nThermophiles and hyperthermophiles accumulate compatible solutes generally \n\ndifferent from those found in mesophiles (Fig. 1). In respect to their chemical nature, \n\nsolutes from (hyper)thermophiles can be divided in two categories: ?-hexose derivates \n\nand polyol-phosphodiesters. Among the ?-hexose derivatives, mannosylglycerate (MG) \n\nis the most common compound in hyperthermophiles, either bacteria or archaea \n\n(Bouveng et al., 1955). Mannosylglyceramide, an uncharged solute chemically related \n\nto MG, was found only in a few strains of Rhodothermus marinus (Silva et al., 1999). \n\nMannosyl-glucosylglycerate and glucosyl-glucosylglycerate are two MG-derivatives \n\nfound in Petrotoga spp. and in Persephonela marina, respectively (Jorge et al., 2007; \n\nFernandes et al., 2010). Another related compound is glucosylglycerate, commonly \n\nfound in halotolerant, mesophilic bacteria and archaea (Kollman et al., 1979; Robertson \n\net al., 1992; Goude et al., 2004; Empadinhas &amp; da Costa 2008). Among \n\n(hyper)thermophiles, glucosylglycerate was found only in the thermophilic bacterium \n\nPersephonella marina (Santos et al., 2007a).  \n\n \n\n   \n\nFIGURE 1- Compatible solutes highly restricted to (hyper)thermophiles. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n3 \n\nDi-myo-inositol-phosphate (DIP) is a solute restricted to microorganisms with optimal \n\ngrowth temperatures above 60\u00baC, hence it is regarded as the most characteristic \n\nmember of the polyol-phosphodiester group (Santos et al., 2007a). DIP is also the only \n\ncompatible solute accumulated by the most robust hyperthermophile, Pyrolobus fumarii \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2008; Bl\u00f6chl et al., 1997). Other examples of the polyol-\n\nphosphodiester group are diglycerol phosphate and glycero-phospho-inositol, which \n\nwere found in members of the genus Archaeoglobus; the latter solute has also been \n\nreported in Aquifex spp. (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2003; Lamosa et al., 2006). Two DIP-\n\nderivates, mannosyl-myo-inositol phosphate and di-mannosyl-di-myo-inositol \n\nphosphate, have been found in representatives of the genera Thermotoga and Aquifex \n\n(Rodrigues et al., 2009). Di-N-acetyl-glucosamine phosphate is a minor solute thus far \n\nonly found in Rubrobacter xylanophilus (Empadinhas et al., 2007). \n\nExamples of other solutes that do not belong to these two categories are: ?-glutamate, \n\npresent in methanogenes (Robertson et al., 1989; Robertson et al., 1990) and also in \n\nhyperthermophilic bacteria (Martins et al., 1996; Lamosa et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., \n\n2010); aspartate that occurs in Palaecoccus and in Thermococcus spp. (Neves et al., \n\n2005; Lamosa et al., 1998); and 1,3,4,6-tetracarboxy-hexane and \n\ngalactosylhydroxylysine, rare solutes found in the thermophilic archaeon, \n\nMethanothermobacter marburgensis and in Thermococcus litoralis, respectively \n\n(Gorkovenko et al., 1994; Lamosa et al., 1998; Martin et al.,1999; M\u00fcller et al.,2005). \n\n \n\nRole of the compatible solute mannosylglycerate  \n \nMannosylglycerate (MG) is accumulated in several thermophilic bacteria like Thermus \n\nthermophilus and Rhodothermus marinus, and also in hyperthermophiles such as \n\nPyrococcus spp. and in some species of the genus Thermococcus (Santos et al., \n\n2007a). It is interesting to note that mannosylglycerate was initially found in an \n\neukaryotic red algae from the order Ceramiales, but its role in these organisms seems \n\nunrelated with osmoregulation (Bouveng et al., 1955).   \n\nThe synthesis of MG in R. marinus proceeds via two pathways (Fig. 2). In the single-\n\nstep pathway, mannosylglycerate synthase catalyzes the condensation of \n\nGDP-mannose and D-glycerate into MG. In the other pathway (two-step pathway), the \n\nmannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose \n\nand D-3-phosphoglycerate into mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate. Dephosphorylation of \n\nmannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate is catalyzed by mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate \n\nphosphatase, yielding MG (Martins et al., 1999; Borges et al., 2004). To date, R. \n\nmarinus is the only organism known to possess the two routes for MG synthesis; \n\n\n\n \n4 \n\nPyrococcus spp., Thermus thermophilus and many other organisms synthesize MG via \n\nthe two-step pathway (Borges et al., 2004; Empadinhas et al., 2001; Empadinhas et al., \n\n2003).  \n\nAn interesting finding was the discovery of a bifuncional mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate \n\nsynthase/phosphatase in the mesophilic bacterium Dehalococcoides ethenogenes that \n\ncatalyses the synthesis of MG at moderate temperatures. The encoding gene was \n\nsuccessfully cloned in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and led to the production of MG \n\n(Empadinhas et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 2 \u2013 Pathways for the synthesis of mannosylglycerate. The single-step pathway using \n\nmannosylglycerate synthase  1  has  been characterized in R. marinus only. The two-step \n\npathway involves mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase  2 and  mannosyl-3-\n\nphosphoglycerate phosphatase  3 . The two-step pathway has been detected in many \n\norganisms adapted to hot environments (Santos et al., 2007a).  \n\n \n\nThe accumulation of MG by microorganisms is generally connected with a response to \n\nosmotic stress. The only exception to this behavior was found in R. marinus in which \n\nMG is the major solute at supra-optimal growth temperatures (Silva et al., 1999). Since \n\nMG is mostly found in organisms adapted to hot environments it is acceptable to \n\nhypothesize that it could have a role in the protection of cellular components under \n\nheat stress. In fact, in vitro assays with model proteins show that MG has a remarkable \n\nability to improve protein thermostability, namely, in respect to structural stability \n\n\n\n \n5 \n\n(measured by the melting temperature), to inhibition of aggregation induced by heat, \n\nand to protection against heat inactivation (Ramos et al.,1997, Borges et al., 2004, \n\nFaria et al., 2003, Faria et al., 2008). Therefore, MG is a valuable compound from the \n\nbiotechnological point of view, and several patents have been filled by our group and \n\nothers (Santos et al., 1996; Santos et al., 1998; da Costa et al., 2003; Lamosa et al., \n\n2006; Lentzen &amp; Schwarz, 2006). Two of the patents originating in our team have been \n\nlicensed to a German company bitop AG, Witten (http://www.bitop.de). Major potential \n\nfields of application are: the cosmetic industry, as moisturizer and skin protector \n\nagainst UV damage, storage of vaccines and other biomaterials, protein stabilizer in \n\nanalytical and clinical kits, and in biosensors. In particular, MG proved to increase the \n\nlife-span of retroviral vectors (Cruz et al., 2006) and to improve DNA microarray \n\nexperiments (Mascellani et al., 2007). \n\nThe major bottleneck towards the industrial utilization of MG is the high production \n\ncosts. Although a procedure for the chemical synthesis of MG has been developed \n\n(Lamosa et al., 2006), the yield is very poor. Therefore, the solution for this difficulty \n\nshould reside in an optimized fermentation process. Currently, commercial MG is \n\nproduced (gram amounts) from fermentation and \u201cmilking\u201d of R. marinus, a natural \n\nproducer. However, the high production cost prevents a wide utilization of this \n\ncompound. In this context, the development of an efficient industrial producer of MG is \n\nmandatory. \n\n \n\nYeast as industrial and model organism \n \nSince ancient times the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in the \n\nproduction of food and alcoholic beverages (Mortimer, 2000). In addition to the \n\ntraditional utilization in the food industry, yeast is also an excellent host for the \n\nproduction of recombinant proteins, offering straightforward genetic tools and highly \n\noptimized cultivation processes. Fast growth rates up to huge cell density make it \n\nprobably the most important industrial organism (Goffeau et al., 1996). Moreover, \n\nyeasts are able to perform complex eukaryotic-type post-translational modifications and \n\nare able to produce proteins similar to those of mammalian origin. Since the early \n\n1980s, a number of vaccines, antigens, hormones and other bio-therapeutic \n\ncompounds have reached to a commercial production. That is the case of insulin, \n\ninterferon and hepatitis A, among others (Hitzeman et al., 1984; Valenzuela et al., \n\n1982). \n\nIn addition to this biotechnological importance, yeast is recognized as a basic \n\neukaryotic model system (Botstein et al., 1997). More specifically, the baker\u2019s yeast \n\n\n\n \n6 \n\n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been proven very useful to understanding \n\nfundamental cellular and molecular processes (Botstein et al., 1997). Despite the \n\nevolutionary distance between yeast and higher eukaryotes (including humans), a high \n\nlevel of conservation is shared in several cellular mechanisms such as, DNA \n\nreplication, cell division, protein turnover, vesicular trafficking, aging, and cell death \n\n(Sugiyama et al., 2009). \n\nS. cerevisiae is an attractive organism to work since it is non-pathogenic, very simple \n\nand inexpensive to manipulate and easy to maintain as stable haploids or diploids. The \n\nduplication time of S. cerevisiae is around 90 min in complex medium; moreover, cells \n\nare easily transformable and it is straightforward to integrate foreign genes in the \n\ngenome (Sugiyama et al., 2009).  \n\nThe sequence of the yeast genome was completed 14 years ago (Suter et al., 2006); \n\npresently, around 80% of the 6000 encoding genes have a predicted function (Christie \n\net al., 2009). A very active and collaborative yeast research community built a series of \n\nbiological resources such as, the yeast gene deletion strains (YGDS), where every \n\nprotein-coding gene in the genome was deleted (Winzeler et al., 1999); the green \n\nfluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged collection of strains, where each gene was tagged \n\nwith GFP (Huh et al., 2003); and a strain collection engineered for protein over-\n\nproduction (Jones et al., 2008). Another major advantage of the yeast system is the \n\navailability of a rich and easily accessible dataset on genetic interactions, protein-\n\nprotein interactions, transcriptional changes and protein localization (Gitler, 2008). \n\nIn summary, the powerful genetic resources together with the extensive accumulated \n\nknowledge makes this simple yeast a key-organism for applied as well as for basic \n\nresearch. \n\n \n\n?-Synuclein as a model to study protein stabilization \n \n?-Synuclein (?-Syn) is an intrinsically unfolded protein with 140 amino acids present \n\nonly in mammalian brains (Jo et al., 2000). This protein has a tendency to self-\n\nassemble and aggregate, and is associated with several devastating \n\nneurodegenerative diseases, known as synucleinopathies (Cole et al., 2002). ?-Syn \n\ncomprises an N-terminal region that acts as a membrane binding domain (Fig. 3), a \n\ncentral hydrophobic domain, essential for oligomerization and fibrilization, and a \n\nC-terminal domain that hinders aggregation for its high solubility (Davidson et al., 1998; \n\nUlmer et al., 2005; Georgieva et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n7 \n\n \n\nFIGURE 3 \u2013 Primary and secondary structure of wild-type ?-Syn. Three main domains can be \n\nconsidered: the N-terminus that confers ?-helix structure, a central hydrophobic domain (NAC) \n\nthat confers ?-sheet and is essential for oligomerization, and a C-terminus that promotes protein \n\nsolubilization. Adapted from Vamvaca et al., 2009. \n\n \n\nThis protein is natively unfolded and when associated with membranes forms two \n\n?-helices in the N-terminal region (Fig. 4). An increment in the concentration of ?-Syn \n\nnearby the plasmatic membrane facilitates the formation of dimers on the membrane \n\nsurface or in the cytoplasm. Through dimerization, ?-Syn adopts ?-sheet secondary \n\nstructure and can associate with other monomers or dimers leading to oligomer \n\nformation. The oligomers act as nuclei for fibril formation and amyloid deposits \n\n(Reviewed in Auluck et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 4 \u2013 Model of ?-Syn interactions with membranes. ?-Syn is natively unfolded and when \n\nassociated to membranes forms two ?-helices. Increase in concentration of ?-Syn favors the \n\nformation of oligomeric forms through association into dimmers and higher oligomers. Adapted \n\nfrom Auluck et al., 2010. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n8 \n\nEffects of ?-synuclein in yeast physiology  \n \nIn yeast, ?-Syn is delivered to the plasma membrane via the classical secretory \n\npathway: the protein migrates from the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi \n\napparatus and is further transported to the plasma membrane in secretory vesicles \n\n(Outeiro &amp; Linquist, 2003; Dixon et al., 2005). ER is the first compartment encountered \n\nby ?-Syn, where it impairs the docking and fusion of ER vesicles into the Golgi \n\napparatus (Cooper et al., 2006). As a consequence, these vesicles accumulate near \n\nthe plasma membrane (Soper et al., 2008). The accumulation of ?-Syn close to the \n\nplasma membrane leads to the formation of small inclusions that progressively grow in \n\nsize towards the cytoplasm. Some of these inclusions stain positive for thioflavin-S \n\nconfirming the presence of ?-sheet in ?-Syn aggregates, while others are ?-Syn-\n\ninduced aggregates of cytoplasmic vesicles (Outeiro &amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al., \n\n2005). \n\nAnother consequence of ER stress is the over-production of reactive oxygen species \n\n(ROS), which indirectly stimulate the production of ROS in the mitochondria and \n\nactivates apoptosis (Flower et al., 2005). Moreover, ?-Syn over-production induces the \n\nimpairment of the proteasome activity as a result of modifications in the proteasome \n\ncomposition. It is believed that these alterations derive from abnormal protein synthesis \n\nin the ER (Chen et al., 2005). Another effect of ER malfunction is the retardation of  \n\nendocytosis, caused by the obstruction in post-vesicle internalization steps and defects \n\nin vacuolar fusion (Outeiro &amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al.,2008). \n\nToxicity of ?-Syn in yeast cells also stems from post-translational modifications \n\ncatalyzed by enzymes such as, acetyltransferase B complex (acetylation) and casein \n\nkinases I and II (phosphorylation), among others ( Zabrocki et al.,2008). Nevertheless, \n\n?-Syn toxicity is dependent on the genetic background and type of plasmid used. In \n\nfact, certain yeast strains display a high number of ?-Syn inclusions without showing \n\nany growth defect; conversely, ?-Syn over-production may be highly toxic to cells \n\nwithout inclusion formation (Sharma et al., 2006; Zabrocki et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\nAim of this work \n\n \n\nThe fermentation of the baker\u00b4s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to produce \n\nhigh-value products is a common practice in industry. Since the use of native \n\nproducers, such as Rhodothermus marinus, for the production of MG is not \n\neconomically feasible, we set out to optimize the production of MG using engineered \n\nstrains of S. cerevisiae. \n\n\n\n \n9 \n\n \n\nA second objective of this work is to assess the efficacy of MG for the stabilization of \n\nproteins in vivo, i.e., in the molecular overcrowded medium that constitutes the \n\ncytoplasm of living cells. This research effort has a dual purpose: i) to find novel \n\napplications for MG, related with its potential ability to suppress protein aggregation \n\ninside the cells; ii) and, to obtain experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis \n\nthat MG acts as a protector of protein structures in vivo. To this end, we took \n\nadvantage of a yeast model for Parkinson\u00b4s disease and investigated the effect of MG \n\non the aggregation of ?-synuclein, by over-producing this aggregating-prone protein \n\ntogether with the MG-biosynthetic enzymes.   \n\n\n\n \n10 \n\nMaterials and Methods\n \n\n \nOptimization of mannosylglycerate production by engineered Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae strains \n\n \n\nStrains and genetic procedures \n\nS. cerevisiae strain VSY71 (a derivative of W303-1A (MATa, ade2-1, can1-100, ura3-1, \n\nleu2-3,112, his3-11,15, trp1-1) with the plasmids pRS306::URA3 and pRS304::TRP1 \n\nintegrated in the chromosome)) and strain CEN.PK2 (MATa/MATa, ura3-52/ura3-52, \n\ntrp1-289/trp1-289, leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112, his3 D1/his3 D1, MAL2-8\nC\n/MAL2-8\n\nC\n) were \n\ntransformed with the plasmid p425::msgD. The plasmid p425::msgD, containing the \n\nmsgD gene that encodes the bifunctional mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate \n\nsynthase/phosphatase from Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, was kindly provided by \n\nDr. Milton S. da Costa (University of Coimbra).  \n\nS. cerevisiae cells were transformed with the plasmid p425::msgD by using the \n\nstandard lithium acetate (LiOAc) procedure (Guthrie &amp; Fink, 1991) with slight \n\nmodifications. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in liquid synthetic complete medium \n\n(SC medium) with 2% glucose at 30\u00baC and 140 rpm. After harvesting by centrifugation \n\n(7000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00baC), cells were re-suspended in water to a final concentration of 5 \n\n\u00d7 10\n8\n cells/ml. An aliquot (5 ml) was collected, centrifuged, and re-suspended in 360 \u00b5l \n\nof a solution containing 33% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 3350,  0.1 M LiOAc, 0.3 mg/ml \n\nboiled salmon sperm DNA, and 1 \u00b5g plasmid DNA. The cell suspension was incubated \n\nin a water bath at 42\n\u00ba\nC for 1 h, and then cells were washed with water, and plated onto \n\nselective solid medium. The transformants derived from the strain VSY71 were \n\nselected in SC medium without uracil, leucine, and tryptophan; the transformants \n\nderived from the strain CEN.PK2 were isolated in SC medium without leucine. \n\n \n\nGrowth conditions \n\nS. cerevisiae strains (VSY71 and CEN.PK2) harboring the plasmid p425::msgD, were \n\ngrown in appropriate selective medium supplemented with 2% glucose (glucose \n\nmedium) at 30\u00baC and 140 rpm. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity at \n\n600 nm (OD600). To determine the effect of different carbon sources in the production of \n\nMG in this mutant, cells were grown overnight in SC medium supplemented with 2% of \n\nthe following carbon sources: glucose, sucrose, mannose, raffinose, and galactose. \n\n\n\n \n11 \n\nEach overnight-grown culture was diluted to a final OD600 of 0.1 with fresh SC medium \n\nsupplemented with the respective carbon source to a final volume of 200 ml. The \n\ncultures were incubated at 30\u00baC and 140 rpm. At the mid-exponential phase (OD600 = \n\n1.6), cells were centrifuged (7000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00baC), washed with water, and frozen at \n\n-20\u00baC until further analysis. The effect on growth of the NaCl concentration was also \n\nstudied. Cells were grown at 37\u00baC in medium containing different NaCl concentrations \n\n(0%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, wt/vol). Samples of each culture (200 ml) were removed during \n\nthe mid-exponential phase and the pool of compatible solutes was determined in cell \n\nextracts by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. \n\n \n\nExtraction and quantification of intracellular organic solutes \n\nEthanol-chloroform extracts of S. cerevisiae strains were performed as previously \n\ndescribed (Santos et al., 2006). Briefly, a culture of 200 ml was grown until \n\nmid-exponential phase, harvested, and centrifuged (7000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00baC). \n\nCompatible solutes were extracted from cells by boiling for 10 min with 80% ethanol. \n\nThe extraction was repeated twice and the combined extracts evaporated to dryness \n\nunder negative pressure; the residue was re-suspended in water:chloroform (1:3, v/v), \n\nand centrifuged to remove solid components. The aqueous extracts were lyophilized \n\nand re-suspended in D2O for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. For \n\ncompatible solute quantification purposes, formate was added as a concentration \n\nstandard, and the \n1\nH-NMR spectra was acquired with a repetition delay of 60 s on a \n\nBruker AMX 300 spectrometer. A sample of cell culture (5 ml) was removed, passed \n\nthrough a 0.22 \u00b5m pore filter (Millipore, USA), and the filter was dried overnight at 85\u00baC \n\nin order to determine dry mass.  \n\n \n\nEffect of mannosylglycerate in the stabilization of proteins in vivo using \n\nengineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains \n\n \nStrains and genetic procedures \n\nMulti-copy plasmids for ?-Syn expression - S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2 was \n\ntransformed with the p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP and the respective transformants \n\nwere designated \u201c?-Syn mutant\u201d. In addition, strain CEN.PK2 was transformed with a \n\ncombination of the following plasmids: (p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus pRS425); \n\n(p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus p425::msgD); (p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus \n\np425::msgD); (pRS425 plus p426GPD).

Culture samples were withdrawn at early, mid-exponential, and \n\nlate-exponential phases, and the percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions was \n\ndetermined by fluorescence microscopy (details described below). \n\n \n\nS. cerevisiae mutants with integrative plasmids \u2013 We found that mutants with multi-\n\ncopy plasmids were unstable, i.e., the level of ?-Syn decreased considerably in \n\nsuccessive growths. Therefore, we resorted to an alternative strategy that used \n\nintegrative plasmids. The S. cerevisiae strain VSY72 producing ?-Syn and MG (MG \n\nmutant) and the strain VSY72, producing only ?-Syn (Control mutant), were grown in \n\n50 ml glucose medium until mid-exponential, centrifuged (7000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00baC), and \n\nre-suspended in TE buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mM, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). This cell suspension \n\nwas used to inoculate 600 ml of SC medium supplemented with galactose (galactose \n\nmedium) to a final OD600 of 0.2. Culture samples (200 ml) were removed during the \n\nearly-exponential phase (10 and 12 hours), and compatible solutes were extracted and \n\nquantified as described above. The dry mass was calculated using 20 ml of culture. \n\nCulture samples were also collected at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after induction and \n\nthe percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions was determined by fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy (details described below).  \n\nTo evaluate the ability of MG to promote solubilization of the ?-Syn inclusions, MG and \n\nControl mutants were grown in 50 ml of SC medium supplemented with 2% raffinose \n\n(raffinose medium) until mid-exponential phase (around 40 h). At this stage, cells were \n\nharvested, re-suspended in TE buffer, and inoculated in 600 ml of galactose medium to \n\na final OD600 of 0.2. After allowing for 9 h of growth in this medium, the galactose \n\nmedium was replaced by glucose medium. After 1 and 3 hours of growth in glucose \n\nmedium, the following sample volumes were collected; 200 ml for solute analysis; 20 \n\nml for dry mass determination; and 20 ml for western blot analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n14 \n\nFluorescence microscopy \n\nFluorescence microscopy analysis was performed with a Zeiss AxioImager (Zeiss, \n\nOberkochen, Germany) microscope. Cells were observed with a 63x/1.4 (Zeiss Plan-\n\nAPO oil) objective and a GFP filter. For each culture sample, a total of 300 cells were \n\ninspected for the presence of ?-Syn inclusions. The percentage of cells with ?-Syn \n\ninclusions was determined by dividing the number of cells containing at least one \n\ninclusion of ?-Syn by the total number of cells counted, and multiplication by 100.  \n\n \n\nWestern blot analysis \n\nS. cerevisiae cells were harvested and washed with water. For each culture sample, \n\nthe number of cells per ml was determined with a Neubauer chamber. Samples \n\ncontaining 6.1 x 10\n7 \n\ncells were taken, re-suspended in SDS/PAGE buffer (Laemmli, \n\n1970), and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were then separated in a 10% SDS/PAGE gel \n\nand transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millippore, USA) for \n\n?-Syn detection. The membranes were treated for 1 h at room temperature with a \n\nblocking solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) milk, and 0.1 % \n\n(v/v) tween 20). Then, membranes were incubated overnight with monoclonal antibody \n\nagainst ?-Syn from mouse (BD Transduction Laboratories\nTM\n\n) in blocking solution using \n\na dilution of 1:6000. After incubation, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS buffer \n\n(150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and 0.1% (v/v) tween 20, and incubated for 1 h \n\nwith the secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (GE healthcare) diluted in 1:1000 in \n\nblocking solution. A chemoluminescence detection kit (Millipore, USA) was used to \n\nvisualize ?-Syn. \n\n \n\nROS assay \n\nTo determine the amount of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in Control and MG \n\nmutants, we used the dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) staining (Madeo et al., 2002). \n\nThe DHR123 is oxidized intracellularly by ROS into rhodamine 123, which emit \n\nfluorescence at 535 nm when excited at 485 nm. To perform this assay, the mutants \n\nwere grown in glucose medium until mid-exponential phase and then centrifuged. \n\nSubsequently, the mutants were re-suspended in galactose medium to induce the \n\n?-Syn expression and allowed to grow for 9 h. In addition, as a negative control \n\nexperiment, the Control mutant was re-suspended in fresh glucose medium, and \n\ngrowth was allowed for 9 hours. Aliquots of the three cultures, containing 1 \u00d7 10\n6 \n\ncells, \n\nwere collected and incubated with DHR 123 dye (final concentration 5 \u00b5g/ml) for 1 h. \n\nThe fluorescence intensity of the samples was measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse \n\nspectrofluorimeter (Varian, USA).   \n\n\n\n \n15 \n\nResults \n \n\nEffect of different carbon sources in the production of mannosylglycerate by \n\nrecombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains \n\nCurrently, mannosylglycerate (MG) is purified from natural producing organisms \n\n(namely Rhodothermus marinus). The extraction and purification yield is very low, and \n\ntherefore, the process is not economically feasible. In this work, we used strains of S. \n\ncerevisiae engineered for the synthesis of MG; moreover, several carbon sources were \n\ntested in an attempt to optimize MG production. The MG-engineered yeast strain \n\nVSY71, harboring the plasmid for MG synthesis, was grown in medium supplemented \n\nwith glucose. Under these conditions, the amount of MG determined was 90 \u00b5mol/g dry \n\nmass (Table 3). Among all tested carbon sources, growth of S. cerevisiae strain VSY71 \n\nin glucose-containing medium led to the production of the highest amount of MG. When \n\nsucrose was used as a carbon source, the amount of MG decreased 69% (28.1 \u00b5mol/g \n\ndry mass). No MG accumulation was detected when the strain VSY71 was grown in \n\nSC medium supplemented with mannose, galactose, or raffinose (Table 3). For the \n\npurpose of comparison, we engineered strain CEN.PK2 to produce MG, as described \n\nby Empadinhas et al., 2004, and determined the production of MG in glucose medium. \n\nUnder these conditions, the MG-engineered strain CEN.PK2 produced 44 \u00b5mol of MG \n\nper gram of dry mass (Table 3), which represents only 48% of the amount produced by \n\nstrain VSY71.   \n\n \n\nTABLE 3. Production of mannosylglcerate in recombinant strains of S. cerevisiae using different \n\ncarbon sources.  \n\nS. cerevisiae Carbon source \nMannosylglycerate \n(\u00b5mol/g dry mass) \n\nVSY71 \n\nGlucose 90.0 \n\nSucrose 28.1 \n\nMannose 0 \n\nGalactose 0 \n\nRaffinose 0 \n\nCEN.PK2 Glucose 44.0 \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate the effect of an osmotic stress in the accumulation of MG, strain \n\nVSY71 was cultivated in glucose medium supplemented with 0%, 2%, 3%, and 4% \n\n\n\n \n16 \n\n(w/v) of NaCl. Analysis of ethanol-chloroform extracts derived from these cultures did \n\nnot result in an increase in the production of MG in comparison with the same strain \n\ngrown in medium without NaCl (data not shown). Instead, we observed the \n\naccumulation of low levels of trehalose (0.9 \u00b5mol/g dry mass) and high amounts of \n\nglycerol (134.7 \u00b5mol/g dry mass), two compatible solutes known to accumulate in S. \n\ncerevisiae in response to osmotic stress (Albertyn et al., 1994; Hounsa et al., 1998). \n\n \n\nEffect of mannosylglycerate on the formation of ?-Syn inclusions \u2013 use of multi-\n\ncopy plasmids to express the gene encoding ?-Syn \n\nThe inhibitory effect of MG on the aggregation of several model proteins has been \n\ndemonstrated in vitro (Santos et al., 2007a). However, it is not known whether MG \n\nmaintains this ability in the molecular overcrowded milieu that constitutes the cell \n\ncytoplasm. To achieve this goal, we constructed a S. cerevisiae mutant that \n\naccumulates MG and concomitantly produces ?-Syn, an aggregating-prone protein that \n\nself-aggregates without further stimuli. In a first attempt we used the S. cerevisiae \n\nstrain CEN.PK2 containing the plasmid for MG synthesis and transformed these cells \n\nwith a plasmid encoding ?-Syn fused with the EGFP tag. The genes were expressed \n\nconstitutively in 2\u00b5 plasmids, a type of yeast plasmid with a high transcription rate.  \n\n \n\nFIGURE 5.  Toxicity of ?-Syn in S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2. A, Growth curves of the wild-type \n\n(WT) and the ?-Syn mutant harboring the plasmid for ?-Syn expression. B, Fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy of the ?-Syn mutant during the early exponential phase of growth. \n\n\n\n \n17 \n\nGrowth of the ?-Syn mutant was strongly inhibited when compared to the wild-type \n\nstrain, indicating that the over-production of ?-Syn is toxic to yeast cells (Fig. 5A). \n\nFluorescence microscopy analysis of the ?-Syn mutant revealed the presence of ?-Syn \n\ninclusions in the cytoplasm in the majority of the cell population (Fig. 5B).  \n\nIn order to evaluate the effect of MG in aggregation of ?-Syn the following mutants \n\nwere constructed: a strain producing only ?-Syn (containing also the empty plasmid \n\npRS425), designated ?-Syn/pRS425 mutant; a strain producing ?-Syn and MG, \n\n?-Syn/MG mutant; and a strain containing the two empty plasmids used to produce \n\n?-Syn and MG, p426GPD/pRS425 mutant (see Materials and Methods for details). \n\nThese mutants were cultivated successively 3 times and stock cultures were frozen at \n\n-80\u00baC. Surprisingly, no differences in the growth profiles of the four mutants were \n\nobserved (Fig. 6A), in contrast with the initial observations (Fig. 5).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 6. Successive growths show that yeast was able to overcome ?-Syn toxicity. A, No \n\nsignificant differences in the growth curves of mutants were observed after 3 successive \n\ngrowths. B, Successive growth curves of ?-Syn mutant. The first culture (1) served as pre-\n\nculture for the second culture (2), which served as pre-culture for the third culture (3). C, \n\nSuccessive growths of the ?-Syn/pRS425 mutant as in B. These experiments were repeated 3 \n\ntimes with similar results.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n18 \n\nThe constructions were repeated using the same methodology leading again to similar \n\ngrowth profiles for all the mutants. To understand why production of ?-Syn did not \n\ninhibit growth as it did in the initial experiment, we monitored growth, localization of ?-\n\nSyn in the cell, and ?-Syn production during the 3 successive growths. \n\nSurprisingly, the successive cultivations of the mutants ?-Syn/pRS425 and ?-Syn/MG \n\nproduced different growth curves. During the successive growths, the lag phase \n\nprogressively decreased and the growth rate increased (Fig. 6, panels B and C). \n\nMoreover, fluorescence microscopy analysis of the cells during the mid-exponential \n\nphase, in the successive cultures, showed a marked decrease in the number of cells \n\nexhibiting cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn (Fig. 7A). To rule out the possibility that \n\nthese results (less cells with inclusions) were due to a decrease in the level of ?-Syn \n\nproduction, we determined the level of ?-Syn by western blot. These analyses showed \n\na progressive decrease in the expression of the gene coding for ?-Syn over the \n\nsuccessive growths, as illustrated in Fig. 7B.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 7.  The production of ?-Syn decreases in successive cultivations of the ?-Syn/pRS425 \n\nmutant. A, Fluorescence microscopy of each of the three cultures examined during the \n\nmid-exponential phase. B, Level of ?-Syn over the successive growths as determined by \n\nwestern blot analysis in the first\n \nculture (1), the second culture (2) and the third culture (3). \n\n \n\nTwo hypotheses can be put forward to explain the decrease of ?-Syn production in the \n\nsuccessive growths: (1) ?-Syn production does not lead to a homogeneous population \n\nof cells harboring inclusions, in other words, there are cells presenting inclusions and \n\ncells without them. Therefore, successive growths may favor cells that do not exhibit \n\n?-Syn inclusions as they could have a higher growth rate; (2) Considering that high \n\n\n\n \n19 \n\nlevels of ?-Syn are highly toxic to the yeast cells, there might be a selective pressure to \n\nreduce the number of plasmid copies without compromising auxotrophy. As a \n\nconsequence of a lower production of ?-Syn, cells would be able to avoid toxicity \n\n(Outeiro &amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al., 2005).  \n\nTo prevent the observed decrease in ?-Syn production we constructed a yeast strain \n\nthat contains two copies of the ?-Syn gene integrated in the genome, thereby \n\npreventing the decrease in the plasmid copy numbers. Moreover, a galactose-inducible \n\npromoter was used to enable a precise control of the timing for ?-Syn expression.  \n\n \n\nEffect of mannosylglycerate on the formation of ?-Syn inclusions \u2013 use of \n\nintegrative plasmids to express ?-Syn \n\nThe strain VSY72 contains two copies of the ?-Syn gene integrated in the genome, \n\nwhich are under the control of a galactose inducible promoter. This strain was used as \n\nhost for the construction of two mutants. In one of them, the plasmid p425::msgD, \n\ncontaining the gene encoding the activities involved in the synthesis of MG was \n\nintroduced in strain VSY72. This mutant was designated as \u201cMG mutant\u201d. In the second \n\nmutant, the empty plasmid (pRS425) was introduced in strain VSY72, and designated \n\nas \u201cControl mutant\u201d. According to established protocols for ?-Syn production, \n\nS. cerevisiae cells were cultivated overnight in SC medium supplemented with 2% \n\nraffinose, and then shifted to medium supplemented with 2% galactose (Outeiro &amp; \n\nLinquist, 2003). However, these experimental conditions did not lead to production of \n\nMG in the MG mutant (Table 4a). To overcome this difficulty, different combinations of \n\ncarbon sources were tested in order to determine the growth condition, in which the \n\nnumber of cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions and the accumulation of MG were maximal. \n\nThe accumulation of MG was determined using the MG mutant, while the formation of \n\n?-Syn inclusions was monitored using the Control mutant (Table 4a and 4b). The \n\nhighest MG accumulation (90 \u00b5mol/g dry mass) was observed when the MG mutant \n\nwas pre-cultivated in glucose, and then cultivated in 2% glucose or in 1% glucose plus \n\n1% galactose (Table 4a). Under these growth conditions, we did not observe any \n\ncytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn in the Control mutant (Table 4b). When this mutant \n\nwas grown in a mixture of 0.4% glucose plus 1.6% galactose, the number of cells \n\ncontaining cytoplasmatic inclusions increased to 20%. Under these growth conditions, \n\nthe MG mutant accumulated 60 \u00b5mol MG/g dry mass. Indeed, high concentrations of \n\nglucose have a repression effect on the galactose metabolism. It is known that glucose \n\ninhibits the expression of the galactose permease, and consequently blocks galactose \n\nuptake (Nehlin et al., 1991).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n20 \n\nTABLE 4a.

Therefore, these conditions (cells grown overnight \n\nin glucose medium, and then re-suspended in 2% galactose), were selected as the \n\nmost appropriate for further experiments. Sample aliquots were removed during the \n\nperiod of galactose induction, and the cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy. \n\nAfter 4 hours of galactose induction, ?-Syn appeared evenly distributed in the \n\ncytoplasm and localized intensely in the cytoplasmatic membrane. After 8 hours of \n\ninduction, ?-Syn is mainly localized in the cytoplasmatic membrane. Continuous \n\nproduction of ?-Syn leads to the formation of small inclusions near the cytoplasmatic \n\nmembrane. At 10 hours of induction, the size of cytoplasmatic inclusions increased and \n\nthey are dispersed through the cytoplasm. This phenotype is transitory, since after 12 \n\nhours, the percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions decreased and at 24 h no cells \n\nwith cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions were visualized (Fig. 8).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n21 \n\n \n\nFIGURE 8. Localization of ?-Syn in the Control mutant at different time points after induction \n\nwith galactose. Between 4 and 6 hours of galactose induction, the fluorescence is localized in \n\nthe cytoplasmatic membrane. At 8 hours, the ?-Syn protein is mainly concentrated in the \n\ncytoplasmatic membrane. With the increase in the concentration of ?-Syn, small cytoplasmatic \n\ninclusions of ?-Syn were observed close to the cytoplasmatic membrane. These inclusions \n\nenlarge and extend through the cell until 10 h post-induction. At 12 h after induction, the \n\nnumber of cytoplasmatic inclusions starts to decrease and at 24 h cells showed no inclusions. \n\n \n\nThe effect of MG in the formation of cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions was determined at \n\n10 and 12 h after galactose induction by comparing the percentage of cells with \n\ninclusions in the MG mutant and the Control mutant (Fig. 9A and 9B). \n\nUpon 10 h of induction, 38.6 \u00b1 4.9% of cells expressing only ?-Syn (Control mutant) \n\nexhibited cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn. This value should be compared with \n\n11.5 \u00b1 5.4% for the mutant expressing ?-Syn plus MG (MG mutant). NMR analysis of \n\nthe ethanolic/chloroformic extracts of Control and MG mutants showed no MG and 19.6 \n\n\u00b5mol MG/g dry mass, respectively (Fig. 9C). We also detected the presence of \n\ntrehalose, a compatible solute accumulated naturally by S. cerevisiae. It is known that \n\ntrehalose acts as a stress protectant of proteins and biological membranes (Singer &amp; \n\nLinquist, 1998). Nevertheless, we verified that there was no significant difference in the \n\nlevel of trehalose between the two mutants, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Syn \n\naggregation observed in the MG mutant is related with MG accumulation and not with \n\ntrehalose accumulation. Interestingly, besides the pronounced effect of MG in the \n\nnumber of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions, the two mutants showed similar growth \n\nrates (data not show). To prove that ?-Syn was produced to similar levels in the two \n\nmutants, we performed western blot analysis with cells collected at 10 h after induction \n\n(Fig. 9D). \n\n\n\n \n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 9. Effect of mannosylglycerate on the formation of cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn. \n\nCells were grown in glucose medium to allow intracellular accumulation of mannosylglycerate \n\nand switched to galactose medium to induce ?-Syn production. A, Percentage of cells showing \n\ninclusions without and with accumulation of mannosylglycerate. The MG mutant contains a \n\nbifunctional enzyme that synthesizes mannosylglycerate from GDP-mannose and \n\n3-phosphoglycerate, and Control mutant contains the empty plasmid pRS425. Data shown are \n\nderived from three independent experiments; for each experiment 300 cells were counted. B, \n\nFluorescence microscopy of Control and MG mutants at 10 and 12 h post-induction. C, Level of \n\nintracellular compatible solutes in the two mutants studied. D, Western blot analysis of ?-Syn-\n\nEGFP proteins detected with an anti-?-Syn antibody in cells at 10 h after induction. \n\n \n\nWe also investigated the ability of MG to promote solubilization of ?-Syn inclusions in \n\nvivo. For that, Control and MG mutants were grown in raffinose until mid-exponential to \n\navoid MG accumulation, then cells were shifted to galactose medium and cultivated for \n\nfurther 9 h to form cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn; finally, cells were shifted to \n\nglucose medium to allow MG accumulation. Aliquots were removed at 1 and 3 hours \n\nafter the switch to glucose medium, and cells were analyzed for ?-Syn inclusions \n\n(fluorescence microscopy), MG accumulation (NMR analysis of cell extracts), and \n\n?-Syn content (western blot). Upon the switch to glucose medium, ?-Syn production \n\nwas repressed and as result the number of cells presenting cytoplasmatic inclusions \n\ndecreased. After the shift to glucose medium, there was a significant decrease in the \n\n\n\n \n23 \n\nnumber of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions in the MG mutant as compared with the \n\nControl mutant (Fig. 10A). After 1 h in glucose medium, 12.7\u00b14.2 % of MG mutant cells \n\nexhibited cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn, while 33.3\u00b16.7 % of Control mutant cells \n\nhad cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn. The difference was more pronounced after 3 h \n\nin glucose medium: 15.0\u00b17.0% of Control mutant cells contained cytoplasmatic ?-Syn \n\ninclusions, to compare with 4.7\u00b13.5% in the MG mutant. The MG content was 12 and \n\n22 \u00b5mol/g dry mass for cultures removed at 1 and 3 hours, respectively (Fig. 10B). \n\nWestern blot showed that ?-Syn was expressed in Control and MG mutant in similar \n\namounts (Fig. 10C).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 10. Mannosylglycerate promotes solubilization of the cytoplasmatic inclusions of \n\n?-Syn. MG and Control mutants were cultivated in galactose for 9 h, period of time where we \n\nobserved the highest amount of cells with inclusions (42%), and then shifted to glucose medium \n\nto allow MG accumulation. Then, aliquots were removed at 1 and 3 hours to calculate: A) \n\nPercentage of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn; B) Intracellular amount of \n\nmannosylglycerate in the MG mutant; and to analyze C) Levels of ?-Syn expression by western \n\nblot in both mutants after 1 hour in glucose medium. The data correspond to three independent \n\nexperiments. \n\n \n\nEffect of MG on the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ?-Syn \n\nover-production  \n\nIt is well known that ?-Syn over-production leads to the formation of ROS and hydrogen \n\nperoxide (Flower et al., 2005). We used DHR 123 staining, a well establish method to \n\n\n\n \n24 \n\ndetect the presence of ROS. This dye accumulates in the cell and is oxidized by ROS, \n\nthereby emitting a fluorescence signal.  \n\nControl mutant was cultured in glucose (no production of ?-Syn) and also in galactose \n\n(high production of ?-Syn). The MG mutant was only cultured in galactose. As \n\nexpected, the production of ?-Syn in the Control mutant increased 3-fold the amount of \n\nROS in comparison with the same cells without ?-Syn production (Fig. 11). \n\nMG-producing cells had ROS levels 30% lower than cells producing only ?-Syn, \n\nsuggesting that MG prevents the accumulation of ROS.  \n\n \n\nFIGURE 11. ROS levels are reduced by the accumulation of mannosylglycerate. Control mutant \n\nwas grown in medium supplemented with glucose (no production of ?-Syn) or galactose (high \n\nproduction of ?-Syn), while MG mutant was grown only in the presence of galactose. ROS \n\naccumulation in these mutants was quantified by fluorescence upon 9 h of cultivation using the \n\nDHR 123 staining method. Data represents the average of three independent experiments. \n\n \n\nThe results presented in Figs. 9 and 11 indicate that MG accumulation in yeast cells \n\nprior to ?-Syn production decreases ?-Syn aggregation and the accumulation of ROS. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n25 \n\nDiscussion \n \nMicroorganisms can accumulate high levels of compatible solutes, making them good \n\ncandidates for the large-scale production of these compounds (Lentzen &amp; Schwarz, \n\n2006). However, the applicability of these bioprocesses demands that the relevant \n\nmicrobial cultures grow fast, to very high cell densities in industrial scale fermentors. \n\nAlternatively, these solutes can be produced in organisms commonly used in industrial \n\nbioprocesses (e.g. E. coli, yeast, Bacillus spp.) after modification of metabolic \n\npathways or insertion of foreign genes (Lentzen &amp; Schwarz, 2006).  \n\nIn this work, we optimized the production of mannosylglycerate (MG) using the yeast \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a robust organism that is well-established as an industrial \n\nproducer. Empadinhas et al., (2004) reported the construction of a S. cerevisiae strain \n\nengineered for the production of MG by expression of the gene msgD encoding \n\nmannosy-3-phosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase, the activities involved in MG \n\nsynthesis. This recombinant strain accumulated a maximum of 49 \u00b5mol/g dry mass of \n\nMG in medium supplemented with glucose (Empadinhas et al., 2004). In this work we \n\nfollowed a similar strategy, but used as host the S. cerevisiae strain VSY71. We \n\nobserved a maximal intracellular concentration of MG of 90 \u00b5mol/g dry mass \n\n(approximately 0.24 \u00b5mol/mg protein) in cells grown in glucose as the sole carbon \n\nsource.  \n\nIn order to optimize MG production, the strain VSY71, harboring the msgD gene, was \n\ncultivated in different carbon sources, such as raffinose, galactose, mannose, and \n\nsucrose. Among the carbon sources examined, MG formation was only observed when \n\ncells were grown on sucrose; however, the MG content in sucrose-grown cells \n\ndecreased 31% in comparison with cells grown in glucose.  \n\nThe engineered strain grew on raffinose, galactose or mannose with a growth yield \n\ncomparable to that on glucose, although with a clearly lower growth rate (data not \n\nshown). It is known that yeast uses ultimately the glycolytic pathway to metabolize \n\nraffinose, galactose or mannose (Kruckeberg &amp; Dickinson, 2004), thus it is curious that \n\ncells grown on these sugars are unable to produce detectable amounts of MG. It is \n\nconceivable that synthesis of MG in these cells is limited by substrate availability, \n\nnamely GDP-mannose and/or 3-phosphoglycerate. The mannose moiety in \n\nGDP-mannose originates from mannose-6-phosphate, which is formed by \n\n\n\n \n26 \n\nisomerization of fructose-6-phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate metabolite, like \n\n3-phosphoglycerate. We speculate that lower glycolytic rates on sugars other than \n\nglucose could lead to insufficient accumulation of these metabolites, and therefore the \n\nactivity leading to MG synthesis would be very low. \n\nEgorova and co-workers (2007) developed a process to produce high amounts of MG \n\nusing the trehalose deficient Thermus thermophilus RQ-1. The Thermus thermophilus \n\nmutant, grown in fed-batch fermentation, accumulated 0.31 \u00b5mol/mg protein of MG. \n\nThis amount was raised up to 0.61 \u00b5mol/mg protein when the mutant was cultivated \n\nunder osmotic stress (Egorova et al., 2007). Therefore, the MG production by the \n\nThermus thermophilus mutant is 2.5-fold higher in comparison with S. cerevisiae \n\nengineered in our work. Despite this lower production, the strategy using recombinant \n\nS. cerevisiae has several advantages, such as: i) large-scale fermentation of yeast is \n\nwell-established and thoroughly optimized; ii) S. cerevisiae grows at 30\u00baC while the \n\ngrowth temperature of Thermus thermophilus is 77\u00baC, which implies extra cost with \n\nenergy consumption; iii) genetic manipulation of S. cerevisiae is straightforward and \n\ninexpensive, which makes this organism more suitable for further rounds of \n\noptimization.  \n\nIn view of the 2-fold increase in the production of MG when comparing strains VSY71 \n\nand CEN.PK2 it would be worth screening a strain collection for other strains of S. \n\ncerevisiae that might be even better MG producers. Further strategies to improve MG \n\nproduction could involve the knock-out of pathways consuming GDP-mannose in an \n\nattempt to increase the pool of this substrate. Moreover, more effort should be invested \n\nin medium manipulation that is likely to result in considerable improvement in \n\nproductivity.  \n\nCompatible solutes are potentially useful in a broad range of applications, from \n\nbiotechnology to medicine (Lentzen &amp; Schwarz, 2006). In biotechnology their \n\napplicability goes from stabilization of proteins, like enzymes or vaccines, to the \n\nprevention of the aggregation of heterologous proteins when produced to high levels \n\n(Carri\u00f3 et al., 2005; Schr\u00f6del &amp; Marco, 2005).  \n\nOne of the applications derives from the protective effect of compatible solutes against  \n\nprotein misfolding and aggregation (Ross &amp; Poirier, 2004). These characteristics make \n\ncompatible solutes good candidates for lead compounds for the treatment of diseases \n\nassociated with the unfolding of proteins, such as prion and amyloid-related illnesses \n\n(Ross &amp; Poirier, 2004). In fact, several studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of \n\nthese solutes in the formation of aggregated proteins. Ryu and co-workers (2008) \n\nstudied the effect of MG, mannosylglyceramide, and glycerol on the aggregation of \n\n?-amyloid protein in mammalian cells. MG had a significant inhibitory effect on \n\n\n\n \n27 \n\n?-amyloid formation and reduced the toxicity of amyloid aggregates in human \n\nneuroblastoma cells, while being innocuous to cells. In contrast, the other compounds \n\nshowed no effect in the prevention of ?-amyloid formation. \n\nIn another report, the role of four compatible solutes (MG, mannosylglyceramide, \n\nectoine and hydroxyectoine) on the aggregation of the prion peptide was explored. In \n\nthis case, MG and hydroxyectoine showed no effect in the prevention of the prion \n\npeptide aggregation. On the other hand, mannosylglyceramide and ectoine were able \n\nto inhibit the aggregation of this peptide and to decrease the prion peptide-induced \n\ntoxicity in human neuroblastoma cells (Kanapathipillai et al., 2008). The authors \n\nsuggested that the ability of solutes to prevent prion aggregation depends highly on \n\ntheir structure and it was inferred that the preferential binding properties of each solute \n\ncould play a key role in the inhibition of aggregation. \n\nIn the present work we propose the use of the MG-accumulating yeast as a model to \n\nstudy protein stabilization in living cells. For that, the S. cerevisiae strain VSY72, \n\nharboring two copies of ?-Syn-EGFP integrated in the genome, was engineered to \n\nsynthesize MG (MG mutant). Remarkably, the accumulation of MG in the MG mutant \n\nled to a 3.5-fold decrease in the number of cells with ?-Syn inclusions in comparison \n\nwith the Control mutant. Moreover, microscopy analysis of MG mutant cells showed \n\nbright fluorescence around the plasma membrane, suggesting that ?-Syn was re-\n\nlocalized to the membrane. \n\nMoreover, we confirmed that ?-Syn over-production was accompanied by a 3-fold \n\nincrease in the level of ROS; most importantly, this increase was clearly attenuated by \n\nthe accumulation of MG in the cells. In healthy cells, the formation of unfolded and \n\nmisfolded proteins is controlled by protein control systems that promote the refolding \n\nand repair of these proteins. When refold or repair is not possible, these aberrant \n\nproteins are marked and eliminated either by the ubiquitin proteasome system or by the \n\nautophagy-lysosome pathway (Haliwell, 2006). The over-production of ?-Syn seems to \n\noverload the capacity of the protein control systems, which raises the magnitude of the \n\noxidative stress imposed to cells, consequently leading to accumulation of ROS. The \n\nobservation that the level of ROS decreased in the MG mutant supports the view that \n\nMG alleviates the oxidative burden associated with ?-Syn over-production, most \n\nprobably by shifting the equilibrium towards ?-Syn forms that are less toxic than \n\noligomers or even mature aggregates.      \n\n It is important to note that there is a controversy about whether ?-Syn production in \n\nyeast cells results in the formation of fibrils. It has been reported that ?-Syn aggregates \n\nstained positive with thioflavin-S, proving that they had an amyloid-like structure \n\n(Zabrocki et al., 2005). More recently, on the basis of electron microscopy studies, it \n\n\n\n \n28 \n\nwas argued that ?-Syn accumulations do not contain fibril structures, but solely clusters \n\nof vesicles (Soper et al., 2008). In this work, we did not characterize the type of \n\nstructures within the bright spots, but since we used the same strain as Zabrocki et al., \n\n(2005), it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the aggregates are amyloid-like \n\nstructures.  \n\nBesides the ability of MG to prevent the formation of ?-Syn inclusions, we also \n\ndemonstrated that MG was able to promote the solubilization of these inclusions. This \n\nunexpected result revealed a new role for this compatible solute beyond protein \n\nstabilization. In fact, our work indicates that MG acts as a molecular chaperone since it \n\neffectively disrupts ?-Syn inclusions, probably promoting the release of native forms of \n\n?-Syn. The role of MG in the prevention / disruption of ?-Syn inclusions can derive from \n\nthree different modes of action: 1) MG may induce cell mechanisms namely, \n\nproteasome and autophagy, which actively degrade misfolded ?-Syn; 2) MG may \n\ninduce or activate chaperones that promote the correct folding of ?-Syn; 3) MG may \n\ndirectly stabilize the structure of ?-Syn preventing the formation of aggregates, similarly \n\nto what happens in in vitro assays of protein stabilization.  \n\nSince western analysis showed that both mutants (Control and MG mutant) had similar \n\nlevels of ?-Syn, probably the MG effect is not due to the induction of cell mechanisms \n\nthat degraded ?-Syn. To check the second hypothesis, it would be interesting to \n\ncompare the transcriptional profiles of the MG mutant and the Control mutant to have a \n\nglobal picture of the impact of MG at the transcriptional level. For example, if MG \n\ninduces chaperone expression it is possible that the effect could be noted by the DNA-\n\nmicroarray methodology. The data available do not allow us to draw a final conclusion, \n\nbut it is possible that the mode of action of MG involves a direct effect, either by binding \n\nto specific regions of the protein or protein-oligomers, or indirectly by changes in the \n\nstructure/dynamics of the protein hydration shell.   \n\n \n\nConcluding remarks \n\nWe constructed a strain of S. cerevisiae that produced 2-fold higher amounts of MG \n\nthan the strain earlier described. Moreover, the specific production was similar to that \n\nof the best natural producer, Rhodothermus marinus. This is an encouraging result, \n\nespecially if we take into account that, unlike R. marinus, S. cerevisiae can be \n\nfermented to very high cell densities. Although much work needs to be done to achieve \n\nthe final goal of producing MG at a competitive cost, this is already an important \n\nachievement that should be followed in further optimization rounds. \n\nWe designed an elegant strategy to demonstrate the efficacy of MG in the protection of \n\nproteins in living cells. MG was able to prevent the aggregation of ?-Syn and thereby \n\n\n\n \n29 \n\ndecrease its toxicity (reduction of ROS level). Moreover, it was shown, for the first time, \n\nthat MG acts as a molecular chaperone by effectively accelerating the disruption of \n\n?-Syn inclusions. The yeast model developed in this work can be easily extended to \n\ntest the effect of MG in the protection of other proteins, thereby verifying whether MG \n\ncan be used as a general protein protector.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n30 \n\nReferences \nAlbertyn J, Hohmann S, Prior B A (1994) Characterization of the osmotic-stress response in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae: osmotic stress and glucose repression regulate glycerol-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase independently Curr Gene. 25:12\u201318 \n\nArg\u00fcelles, J C (2000) Physiological roles of trehalose in bacteria and yeast: a comparative \nanalysis.

So far, MDIP has only been found in hyperthermophilic \n\nbacteria of the genera Thermotoga and Aquifex (Santos et al., 2007): in Aquifex spp., \n\nMDIP accumulates in response to osmotic stress, whereas it contributes to the heat \n\nstress response in Thermotoga spp.  \n\nIn order to determine the growth conditions that lead to maximum accumulation of \n\nMDIP in T. maritima, this hyperthermophile was grown at different temperatures (80\u00baC \n\nand 85\u00baC) and the cultures were harvested at different growth phases (mid- and late-\n\nexponential phases). For each growth condition, ethanolic-chloroformic extractions \n\nwere performed as described in Material and Methods.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 12 - Effect of the growth temperature on the accumulation of di-myo-inositol phosphate \n\n(DIP) and mannosyl-di-myo-inositol phosphate (MDIP) in Thermotoga maritima at mid- and \n\nlate-exponential growth phases.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n37 \n\nThe pool of compatible solutes (DIP and MDIP) was quantified by \n31\n\nP-NMR. The \n\nhighest MDIP accumulation was observed when cells were grown at a temperature of \n\n85\u00baC and harvested during the mid-exponential phase (Fig. 12). \n\nSubsequently, the T. maritima was grown in a 300 L fermentor at 85\u00baC, and the \n\ncompatible solutes were extracted from the biomass by using ethanol-chloroform \n\nextraction. The extract was loaded onto a QAE-Sephadex A25 column previously \n\nequilibrated with 5.0 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.8. The elution was performed with \n\none bed volume of the same buffer, followed by a linear gradient of 5.0 mM to 1 M \n\nsodium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml.min\n-1\n. The fractions eluted were analyzed by \n\n31\nP-NMR to monitor the presence of MDIP. Two fractions were obtained: the first \n\nfraction contained pure MDIP was eluted at 100 mM sodium bicarbonate, while the \n\nsecond fraction was eluted at 200 mM sodium bicarbonate and contained a mixture of \n\nDIP plus MDIP. Unfortunately, the amount of pure MDIP obtained after the purification \n\nprocess was not sufficient to examine the effect of MDIP on the thermal stabilization of \n\nmodel proteins."}]}}}
