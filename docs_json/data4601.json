Although this family of polymers already presents some great qualities and properties for biomedical use, there is a rising necessity to input some modifications in their structure in order to enhance their characteristic and widen their application spectrum.\nThe objective of this work is to test some chemical modifications in two polysaccharides of highly biomedical interest, namely dextran and sodium alginate, in order to provide them some extra properties which allow their use in biomedical applications like the encapsulation of cells or bioactive agents. The modifications attempted were: the input of azide and alkyne groups through hydrolysable carbonate esters, periodate oxidations and functionalizations with a fluorescent compound (3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin) and a provider of methacrylate groups (2-aminoethyl methacrylate).\nIn this report are described all the modifications carried out in these polymers in terms of chemical aspects, procedures results.\nAt the end of this work, were obtained successful results for the periodate oxidations and the fluorescence and methacrylate functionalizations. However for the modification of the polymers with azide and alkyne groups is a process that requires further study and development.\nRESUMO\nActualmente, o uso de pol\u00edmeros naturais em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas provocou um aumento na exig\u00eancia de mais investiga\u00e7\u00e3o nesta \u00e1rea.

Some examples of this kind of applications are the drug delivery systems, microcapsules, multilayer films, hollow capsules, nanoparticles, scaffolds for tissue engineering, and many others [1].\nAmongst the different polymeric materials used for these devices, the focus of this work sets on the natural based ones.\nNatural-based polymers, or polymers of natural origin like polysaccharides or proteins, were traditionally used as sources of wound dressings and suture threads either in their natural form or chemically modified. Despite being rather difficult to process, exhibit poorly reproducible properties, the possibility of being immunogenic and difficulty on the storage due to their sensibility to microorganisms and humidity, they are commonly regarded as suitable therapeutic devices [2].\nThese polymers hold many properties that make them extremely suitable for this kind of use. They are extremely biocompatible, biodegradable, renewable, nontoxic and affordable at reasonable values. However, these applications demand natural polymers with some slight chemical modifications that need to be well-defined in order to allow the fine tuning of the properties required for the materials [3, 4].\nOften the structural and functional properties of natural-based polymers are superior to the synthetic ones [5]. Nonetheless, we can increase their value by inducing chemical modifications to their structure [6]. With this in mind, we established the objective of this project the testing of several chemical modifications to this type of polymers in order to increase their interest and their utility in biomedical applications.\nIn Nature, there's a wide range of natural polymers derived from several renewable sources [5]. To narrow our field of interest we focused in two specific polysaccharides, dextran and sodium alginate. The diversity, abundance and considerable low cost, allows them to play a prominent role in many industrial and biomedical uses [6].\nThis work was intended to be a support to an ongoing Ph.D. work, developed by Joana C. Silva, on micro-encapsulation of Langerhans's islets for controlled delivery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes. The first approach was to take advantage of \u201cclick-chemistry\u201d to serve the purpose of developing encapsulation methods for the cells. The first step of this pathway is the functionalization of natural-based polymers (dextran and sodium alginate) with azide and alkyne groups and then carried on functionalization reactions by \u201cclickchemistry\u201d processes.\nBesides the modifications aiming the encapsulation of cells or bioactive compounds, there is also the intention of modifying dextran and sodium alginate conferring them distinct features like fluorescence or functional groups that can facilitate its use in the desired applications (cell encapsulation). For this purposes the first stage was to realize a periodate oxidation of these polymers in order to functionalize them with aldehyde groups and then take advantage these functional groups to input fluorescence and methacrylate groups. The fluorescence is given by a fluorescent compound which has an amine group in its constitution (3-amino-7diethylamino coumarin), and is intended to be used to evaluate the use of this type of modified polymers in future encapsulations. The methacrylate groups are donated by a compound that also as an amine group in its constitution (2-aminoethyl methacrylate) and are intended to be used by Michael addition in applications of cell adhesion or encapsulation.\nThis report describes several chemical modifications performed in this two natural-based polymers as well as the respective outcome of each procedure. In order to assess their viability for future work in this area.\nCHAPTER I\nBASIC CONCEPTS\n1.1.\tPolysaccharides\nPolysaccharides are naturally occurring carbohydrates. These macromolecules have two main functions in life: to be energy sources and to be extra-cellular and structural elements. This kind of polymers has various sources; they can be of algal origin, plant origin, microbial and animal origin [7, 8].\nThe basic constitution of these macromolecules is either one small repeating unit or two alternating units linked together by glycosidic bonds. Their structures are often linear, but it's possible the formation of six or more different units of sugars connected in a branch chain which holds specific information about the recognition of the polysaccharide in comparison with others [7].\nThe general formula of a polysaccharide is Cx(H2O)y being x a large number between 200 and 2500. If we consider that often the polymer backbone repeating units are six-carbon monosaccharides, we can assume (C6H1oO5)n, where n is a number between 40 and 3000, also as a representation of the general formula [8].\nIn nature, the most abundant polysaccharides are starch and cellulose, both consisting in repeating D-glucose units. Another way of referring to these polymers is to use the term glycan. Glycans differ from each other in the repeating unit (monosaccharide), in the length of the chain, in the types of linking units and in the degree of branching [7].\nThere are two main types of polysaccharides: homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides. In figure 1 are shown some examples of these two types of polysaccharides [9].\nHomo-Polysaccharides\nCellulose, 0(1 ->4)\nAmylose, a( 1 \u2014>4)\nOH\tOH\nXylan, p( 1 ->4)\nChitin, P( 1 \u2014>4)\nH e tero-Polysaccharides\nHyaluronic Acid, p(l \u2014>4), p(l\u2014>3)\nFigure 1 - Examples of homo and heteropolysaccharides.\nHomopolysaccharides are made up of one type of repeating unit, or monomer; while heteropolysaccharides have two or more types of monomers. In terms of use, the majority of homopolysaccharides are used as sources of energy for biological processes, as is the case of starch and glycogens; heteropolysaccharides are responsible for providing structural and extracellular support, such as chitin and cellulose in animal exoskeletons and plant cell walls respectively, they are main constituents of the extracellular matrix too [7, 9].\nThe molecular weight of natural occurring polysaccharides has a wide range, due to the natural process of polymerization of monomeric units catalyzed by enzymes [7]. However, every day there are improvements to the enzymatic polymerization process of polysaccharides, making it possible to obtain more controlled and specific polymers [9, 10].\nWhen we want to classify polysaccharides we have to take in account several aspects: the monosaccharides present, the sequences of linkages between them, the anomeric configuration of linkages, the ring size (furanose or pyranose), the absolute configuration (D- or L-), and the presence of other substituents like nucleic acids or proteins which have great influence in the specificity of the polysaccharide [7, 11].\nThe physicochemical properties of this kind of polymers are greatly influenced by the linkage mode of the monosaccharides within the polysaccharide and also by certain structural characteristics and intermolecular associations. A good example of this is the difference between amylose and cellulose. Both are homopolymers composed by glycosidic residues. However their linkage mode is different which makes amylose water-soluble and digestible whereas cellulose is neither water-soluble nor digestible [12].\nThe arrangements between the interunit glycosidic bonds are in order to satisfy the intra- and inter- molecular forces. The regularity and degree of stiffness of the chains affects the rate of fermentation, yielding polysaccharides more flexible or rigid than others [7].\nIn terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, the large number of hydroxyl groups is responsible for the hydrophilic character of these polymers, but they are also responsible for the presence of apolar surfaces depending on the epimeric structure, the monomer ring conformation and the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bonds. This factor explains why even when there are many hydroxyl groups present in the polysaccharide, it has a hydrophobic character, or at least a less hydrophilic one, because the interaction of the hydroxyl groups occurs amongst themselves, or with the hydroxyl groups of a neighboring polysaccharide, instead of occurring with water molecules [7].\nThere have been many advances in the use of Polysaccharides due to the ability of the scientific community to unravel the complexity and the specific characteristics of this kind of polymers in nature. The knowledge acquired about these products is essential to make practical applications like model and shape the various biological, physical and chemical inter-relations taking place, and also to create new and more developed characterization tools [13].\nThe main areas that evolved the use of polysaccharide-based substances were the health and cosmetic industry, food and feed production, and cellulose derived industries (paper, wood products and other cellulose derivatives like textiles) [13].\nTo the applications shown on table 1 is essential to add the various structures that can be obtained with these sugar-based synthetic polymers, including linear, branched, comb-like polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked hydrogels. These structures are synthesized according to the application that the polymer will be used, for example hydrogels swell significantly in water, they are biocompatible and hydrophilic, so they can be used as matrices for drug delivery systems and contact lenses amongst other biomedical and tissue engineering applications [7].\nTable 1 - Applications that involve the use of several polysaccharides [13].\nPolysaccharides\tApplications\nStarch and starch derivatives, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, chitosan, dextran, hyaluronan, pectin, carrageenan\tDrug delivery systems\nChitosan, alginates, bacterial cellulose, hyaluronan\tWound healing\nCellulose, hyaluronan, chitosan, alginates\tTissue engineering scaffolds and implants\nHeparin, chitosan\tBioactive compounds as anti-microbial, anti-clotting of blood, drugs and vaccines\nHyaluronan, chitosan, aloe\tSkin hydration, anti-aging agents, skin protection (antibacterial agents)\nBacterial polysaccharides\tVaccines\nIn the two sections below will be addressed the two polysaccharides used in this work, dextran and sodium alginate.\n1.2.\tDextran\nDextran is the term used to name a big class of a-D-glucans, containing anhydro-D-glucopyranose. The composition of this kind of polymers is 95% a-1,6-glucopyranosidic linkages and 5% 1,3-linkages which are branching points for attachment of side chains. The side chains have 1 or 2 glucose residues in length in about 85% of the polymers; the remaining 15% have an average length of 33 glucose residues. The branches (or side chains) are usually attached to the main chains by different a-1,2-, a-1,3-, and a-1,4-glycosidic bonds [7, 8, 14].\nFigure 2 shows the structure of Dextran, it is visible the a-1,6- linked glucose main chain as well as the branching points in 2-, 3- and 4-positions [8, 15].\n1.2.1.\tOrigin\nDextran is a microbiological product of a large number of bacteria of family Lactobacillaceae, especially from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc dextranicum and Streptobacterium dextranicum [7, 16].\nThe products of these bacteria have different chemical composition, structures and properties, like degree of branching, relative quantity of particular type of glycosidic links, molecular weight, solubility, optical activity and physiological action.(Natural) The most commonly used dextran for industrial and investigative purposes is the Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512 [16].\nNative-dextran, as it is called the product of the microbiological synthesis, is a polymer of high molecular weight. However it is possible to synthesize low molecular weight dextran in sucrose mediums or other mediums containing anhydro-D-glucopyranose units by fermentation. Another way of obtaining dextran with lower molecular weight is to undergo a partial depolymerization of native-dextran by acid hydrolysis and subsequent fractionation (clinical dextran) [7]. It can also be produced enzymatically, using cell-free culture supernatants which contain dextransucrase [15].\n1.2.2.\tStructure\nAs shown in figure 2 and described above, the structure of dextran is mainly a-1,6-linkages between glucose units with branching points, with the degree and nature of branching being dependent on the bacterial strain used to produce the polymer [17].\nThere are several methods to assess if the structure is really the one described, optical rotation, infrared spectroscopy, periodate-oxidation reactions and methylation analysis combined with a capillary gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GLC-MS), being this last one the most\neffective [15, 18].\nh+/h2o\nNaBI-L}\n\u2014OH\n'a\nCH2OH\n1.\tNaCH2-SO-CH3\n2.\tCH3I\nHjCQ\u2014\nO O H II\nH3CC-O-CCH3\nh3co\u2014\n\u2014och3\n\u2014OCCH\nII 3\nH,CCOCH, O\na h 2\nO\nH3CO Ij\nx o II ch2occh3\n\u2014och3\n\u20140\u00b0^\nch2oh\n\u201400'a\nGLC-MS\nFigure 3 - Dextran structure determination by methylation analysis with subsequent GLC-MS.\nIn figure 3 is portrayed the method of methylation analysis to determine the structure of dextran demonstrated in a a-1,6-linked glucose unit.\nIn order to completely understand the structure of this polymer were performed studies using degradative enzymes, thin-layer chromatography, HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) and 13C NMR (Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) [15]. To evaluate the length of the side chains it is used a method of sequential alkaline degradation [18].\nIn figure 4 is shown a 13C NMR spectrum of Dextran. Along with figure 4, is presented table 2 that shows the chemical shifts for this polymer [15].\nFigure 4 - 13C NMR spectrum of Dextran (Mw 60000 g mol-1) in DMSO-d6.\nTable 2 - Chemical shifts for Dextran in DMSO-d6 [15].\nPosition\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t6'\n1H NMR\t4.70-4.69\t3.19-3.28\t3.43-3.47\t3.19-3.28\t3.63-3.65\t3.73-3.77\t3.55-3.59\nT3C NMR\t98.9\t72.5\t74.1\t71.0\t71.1\t67.1\t-\n1.2.3.\tPhysico-Chemical characteristics and properties\n7\tA\nNative-dextran is normally of high molecular weight (ranging from 10' to 10\u00b0 g mol-') associated with high polydispersity as result of the increase in branching density. However the most interesting dextrans for most of the applications are fractions with more defined molecular weight [7, 15].\nIn low concentration aqueous solutions, dextran molecules have a random coil behavior (Newtonian behaviour) [19]. Nonetheless if the increase of concentration reaches an overlap value the chains get entangled amongst themselves forming a more compact geometry like a transient network (nonNewtonian behaviour) [20, 21].\nNative-dextran is normally amorphous but in a mixture of water/polyethylene glycol with temperatures between 120 and 200\u00b0C the formation of small crystals can occur [15].\nThe different bacterial strains from which dextran is produced give it different properties, due to the structural diversity. For the most common, the one with the a-1,6- glycosidic bonds, the chains have a certain mobility that allow it to be soluble in water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMA/LiCl), formamide, ethylene glycol, glycerol, aqueous urea (6 M), aqueous glycine (2 M) and 4-methylmorpholine-4-oxide. The kinetics of dissolution is influenced by the molecular weight of the polymer [15, 19, 22].\nLow molecular weight dextran solutions are not very stable, when stored there can be the occurrence of precipitates, if the solution is highly concentrated (50-60%) there can even be the formation of a hydrogel caused by sol-gel conversion. The viscosity of the polymer in solution is directly related to the concentration of the solution, as well as to the molecular weight of the polymer\n[15].\nPhysiologically, this polymer is harmless due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-immunogenic or non-antigenic character. The degradation of this polymer in the human body is done by the action of dextranases (a-1-glycosidases) present in the liver, spleen, kidney and lower part of the gastrointestinal tract [2, 15].\n1.3.\tSodium Alginate\nAlginate is a natural anionic polysaccharide found in seaweed, mainly composed of (1-4)-linked p-D-mannuronic acid and a-L-guluronic acid repeating units. In its constitution it has a number of blocks or regions of sequential units of mannuronic acid, guluronic acid or a combination of both. The origin of the alginate is responsible for the amount and distribution of the blocks along the polymer [2, 23, 24].\n1.3.1.\tOrigin\nAside from the seaweeds, mentioned before, alginates are produced by the microorganism Azotobacter vinelandii and certain Pseudomonas strains. Laminaria hyperborea, Macrocystis pyrifera and Ascophyllum nodosum are the main sources from which most of the commercially available alginates are isolated from. There are other minor sources like Laminaria digitate, Laminaria japonica, Eclonia maxima, Lesonia negrescens and Sargassum sp. [25, 26].\nThe natural occurrence of alginic acid in the form of mixed salts of Na+, Mg2 , and Ca2 is the main constituent of the cell wall of brown macro algae [25].\nThe process of extraction and purification of alginate from brown algae has five main steps [25]:\n1.\tExtraction of the soluble alginic acid with 0.1-0.2 N mineral acid, along with mechanical treatment to facilitate the diffusion of the material out of the algal mass. This step removes other salts and polymers;\n2.\tNeutralization with sodium hydroxide in order to obtain sodium alginate;\n3.\tPrecipitation by adding CaCl2 or ethanol;\n4.\tBleaching with H2O2 and NaClO2, repeated precipitation with ethanol or acetone and treatment with activated carbon or polyvinylpyrrolidone to remove polyphenols (contaminants);\n5.\tUltrasonification to obtain polymers with different chain length.\nThe harvesting of algae for alginate producing is done in cold and temperate waters like in the North of Europe, South American west coast, Southern Australia, Japan and China; being the total worldwide production of this polymers approximately 30000 Mtons per year [24, 25].\n1.3.2.\tStructure\nAs mentioned before, alginates are linear unbranched polymers made of both mannuronic and guluronic acid residues. The occurrence of the monomers has three different ways: blocks of only mannuronic acid units (M blocks), blocks of only guluronic units (G blocks) and blocks of both units in an alternating sequence (MG blocks) [23]. In figure 5, it is visible the structure of the monomers of an alginate as well as part of an alginate structure with the various monomer arrangements possible [24].\nNaOOC\nNaOOC\nNaOOC\nNaOOC\nOH NaOOC\n\u201cOH NaOOC HO\nOH\nOH I\nNaOOC\nHO\nGulA (G)\n-J / TO HO\nO\nHO\nOH NaOOC\nFigure 5 -.- Part of the structure of Sodium Alginate. In a it is shown the conformations of the P-D-mannuronic acid (M) sodium salt and the a-L-guluronic acid (G) sodium salt. In b it is visible the block composition of the polymer.\nOH\nHO\nlO\nManA (M)\nV\nG - block\nM - block\nGM - block\nIn figure 5 it is also visible that the ring conformation for mannuronic acid is\nA\t1\n4C1 and for guluronic acid is 1C4 [24].\nThe confirmation of the structure and composition of the polymer can be made by high resolution 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Figure 6 shows an example of a d\n'H NMR spectrum of an alginate isolated from Laminaria hyperborea [24].\nFigure 6 -1H NMR spectrum of an alginate isolated from Laminaria hyperborea\nThe various points marked in figure 6 represent the following segments of the polymer [24]:\n\u2022\tM-1M and M-1G represent the anomeric proton of an M residue neighboring another M residue or a G residue, respectively;\n\u2022\tMG-5M , GG-5M , and MG-5G refer to the H-5 proton of the central G residue in an MGM, GGM, or MGG triad, respectively;\n\u2022\tG-1 refers to the anomeric proton of G residues and GG-5G refers to the anomeric proton of G residues in G-blocks.\nThere can be certain variations in the composition of this polymer, for instance alginates extracted from Azotobacter vinelandii initially present homopolymeric M-blocks and some of them are later converted into epimer C-5 G-blocks by the action of an extracellular enzyme, mannuronan C-5 epimerase. This epimerization process is also used to modify the composition of algal alginates; this\nprocess is inhibited by the presence of O-acetyl groups which are also present in bacterial alginates [25].\nThe ratio between M and G blocks differs according to the specie from which the polymer was extracted. This fact has an influence in the polymer properties, because of the particular shapes of the monomeric units and their modes of linkage which create different geometries for all of this it is possible to say that alginates don't have a regular repeating unit [24, 25].\n1.3.3.\tPhysico-chemical characteristics and properties\nOne of the most interesting characteristics of alginates is their ion binding properties [24]. These polymers can form gels resulting of the interaction between the carboxylic groups present in their backbone and some divalent cations [26, 27]. The affinity order for alginate's different blocks is described in table 3 [24, 25].\nTable 3 - Affinity order between alginate blocks and some divalent cations.\nG-blocks\tBa2+ > Sr2* > Ca2+ >> Mg2+\nM-blocks\tBa2+ > Sr2+ \u00ab Ca2+ \u00ab Mg2+\nMG-blocks\tBa2+ \u00ab Sr2+ \u00ab Ca2+ \u00ab Mg2+\nThe carboxylic groups when in contact with those ions form an \u201cegg-box\u201d -shaped structure thus forming the hydrogel [23]. This process is portrayed in figure 7, where we can see the formation of the gel by the \u201cegg-box\u201d-model as well as the Ca2 -dependent epimerization process [26].\nFigure 7 - Structure of Azotobacter alginate. (A) Block structure; (B) and (C) forming a hard gel.\nAfter the formation of the hydrogel, there is a way of disrupting it. The use of a chelating agent (like sodium citrate) is an effective way of carrying out this task in a way that it captures the cations that hold this network together [23].\nAnother way of taking advantage of these ion binding properties is the fact that when a sodium alginate solution is poured drop-wise into a CaCl2 solution it takes the shape of spherical beads of Ca-alginate. These beads have very high interest for biomedical applications [25].\nConcerning the molecular weight, this kind of polymers is generally polydisperse, whether they have natural or bacterial origin or even if they were enzymatically tailored. The reasons for this to happen are: the production of polysaccharides is not gene-encoded but it has an enzymatic dependence and the extraction causes substantial depolymerization. Most of the commercially available\nd\nalginates present a value of 200000 g mol-1 for the weight-average molecular weight, although there are samples that can present values as high as 400000 to\nd\n500000 g mol-1. The polydispersity index (ratio between weight-average and\nnumber-average molecular weights) for most of the alginate samples is between\n1.5\tand 3, being 1 the index value for a perfectly monodisperse sample, but there can be samples with index values climbing up to 6 [24].\nIn terms of solubility, it must be taken in account that the pH of the aqueous solution has a great importance, influencing greatly the solubility of the polymer in water [28]. In solution, alginate is highly viscous. This viscosity is due to the extended conformation of the alginate molecule which confers it a large hydrodynamic volume. Factors like ionic strength of the solution and molecular weight and composition of the alginates (ratio of M and G blocks) are responsible for variations in viscosity [26].\nAlginates are biocompatible, biodegradable, mucoadhesive, hemocompatible, non-toxic, non-immunogenic and reasonably priced. These characteristics along with all the others mentioned before make it a very interesting polymer for biomedical applications [29-31].\n1.4.\tChemical modifications\nAs described in the sections above, polysaccharides have a wide range of molecular weights and varying chemical compositions which contribute to their diversity in structures and properties [8]. They also have a large number of reactive groups (i.e. hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl) that can be chemically modified to obtain interesting derivatives in the applications point of view [32].\nAfter the chemical modification, polysaccharides present different characteristics or properties, so this amphiphilic behaviour presented post modification opens a wider spectrum of possibilities in applications for these polymers (for example rheology modifiers, emulsion stabilizers, surface modifiers for liposomes and nanoparticles used as drug delivery systems) [8, 11].\nIn this section will be addressed some chemical modifications that can be performed in polysaccharides, namely in dextran and sodium alginate.\n1.4.1.\tModification of dextran and sodium alginate with alkyne and azide groups through hydrolysable carbonate esters\nThis modification comprises the connection of alkyne or azide groups to the dextran backbone resulting in a hydrolysable carbonate ester [33].\nTo achieve the intended objective for this process it's necessary to perform two reaction steps:\n1.\tActivation of propargyl alcohol or 3-azidopropanol with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI);\n2.\tGrafting of the activated products onto the dextran backbone chain.\nIn the first step the activation process involves the conversion of propargyl alcohol and 3-azidopropanol (alcohols) into propargyl carbonylimidazole and 3-azidopropyl carbonylimidazole (carbamates), respectively. The products of the first step serve as reagents for the second step, in which the same type of conversion takes place to graft propargyl carbonylimidazole and 3-azidopropyl carbonylimidazole into the dextran backbone, forming a carbonate ester between the backbone of the polymer and the pending modified moieties [33].\nFigure 8 shows the scheme of the reaction of the synthesis of dextran propargyl carbonate (dex-C=C) and dextran azidopropyl carbonate (dex-N3). Represented by number (1) and (2) are the events referring to the first reaction step; numbers (3) and (4) show the second step events [33].\nFigure 8 - Reaction scheme of the synthesis of dextran propargyl carbonate (3) and dextran azidopropyl carbonate (4).\nThis modification has a great deal of interest because it opens the door for the use of \u201cclick-chemistry\u201d to obtain multilayered polymers (cross-linked) that can be degraded by hydrolysis [1].\n1.4.2.\tModification of Dextran with CDI and functionalization with alkyne and azide groups\nIn this modification is applied the same principle of the one before. However there are some changes in the reaction order.\nFigure 9 - Schematics for the reaction of synthesis of dex-CEC (2) and dex-N3 (3).\nAccording to figure 9, the first step of the process is the grafting of the CDI into the dextran chain, resulting in the formation of the carbamate group in the linkage. The second step is the functionalization of the product obtained in the first step with the propargyl alcohol and the 3-azidopropanol, forming dex-C=C (2) and dex-N3 (3), respectively, with the appearance of the carbonate ester group in the linkages [33].\nThe purpose of this modification is to try an alternative route to the one described above and to observe if the products obtained have the same properties and applications.\n1.4.3.\tPeriodate oxidation of polysaccharides\nNowadays the periodate oxidation is seen as a way of introducing dialdehydes into polysaccharides and glycoproteins. However initially it was considered a great technique of structure determination for complex carbohydrates. Still with the appearance of novel and more efficient analysis techniques this use was abandoned [34].\nThis modification consists in the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond in compounds that have an oxygen bearing carbon each as an hydroxyl or as a carbonyl group [35]. It is of high interest because it enables the polysaccharide structures with aldehyde functionalities, which makes them very reactive towards M-nucleophiles, like amines, hydrazines or carbazates [16].\nFigure 10 - Main products (dialdehydes) obtained for (1^2)-linked, (1^3)-linked, (1^4)-linked, (1^6)-linked, and terminal (non-reducing) hexose residues of P-D-glucose.\nAccording to figure 10, (a) represents terminal (non-reducing end) residues that undergo double oxidation between C2 and C3 and between C3 and C4, respectively, with the release of C3 as formaldehyde; (b) are (1 >4)-linked residues where cleavage occurs between C2 and C3, and (c) stands for (1 >3)-linked residues (non-terminal), which are resistant to oxidation [34].\nIt is important to know the oxidation pattern obtained because it has great influence in the final properties of the polymer. For most simple glycans it is reasonable to say that oxidation is almost random, however that fact can't be assured because there can always occur some deviation due to possibilities for faster oxidation of reducing and non-reducing ends. The oxidation of a residue in the vicinity of another oxidized residue isn't a major factor, unless we're dealing with very high degrees of oxidation [34].\nIn terms of properties it is known that periodate oxidation of polysaccharides creates a liability in the hydrolytic stability of the polymers. This susceptibility along with the increase in flexibility of the chains due to the ring opening followed by the glycol cleavage can be used to tailor biomaterials with enhanced degradability and suitability for in vivo applications [34, 35].\n1.4.4.\tPeriodate oxidation of dextran\nIn the periodate oxidation of dextran the periodate ion attacks the a-1,6 units breaking the C-C bond and yielding aldehyde groups , regularly the attack occurs between carbons C3-C4 or C3-C2. This process is developed in aqueous medium with no need for a catalyst [16, 36].\nDuring the oxidation process, the C3-C4 cleavage is favoured when compared to the C3-C2 in a proportion of 7.5:1. There is also the possibility of a second oxidation because C3 aldehyde group has a vicinal hydroxyl group, which is susceptible to further attack, expelling this carbon as formic acid [37]. This second attack is due to the high reactivity of originated aldehyde groups, which are\nvery susceptible to attacks from neighbouring hydroxyl groups, thus forming hemiacetals. As result of this modification it is also observed a decrease in the average molecular weight and an increase in polydispersity [16, 38].\nFigure 11 - Three possible periodate oxidations for a-1,6 glucose residues of dextran. (A) Attack at C3-C4; (B) C3-C2 and (C) double oxidation.\nIn figure 11 are portrayed the three possible outcomes of the periodate oxidation process of dextran. Figure 12 shows the possible hemiacetal groups formation that take place after the oxidation.\nFigure 12 - The possible hemiacetal formations for the three possibilities of oxidation.\n1.4.5.\tPeriodate oxidation of Sodium Alginate\nThe periodate oxidation of sodium alginate in dilute solutions occurs randomly, in a way that in one chain only one monomeric unit is oxidized at a certain time, and immediately the protection of the vicinity of that unit takes place, before the occurrence of another oxidative attack on the chain [35].\nThe process of oxidation by periodate ions involves and extensive cleavage of the alginate chains that can occur by two ways [35]:\n\u2022\tThe fast one (not mediated by hydroxyl free-radical) due to the cleavage of infrequent and unusual monomers, which break the main chains;\n\u2022\tThe slow one (due to low concentrations of hydroxyl radicals) attributed to the appearance of free-radicals during the oxidation resultant of the oxidation of phenolic impurities present in alginate.\nTo oxidize alginate, periodate ions cleave the C-C bond of the c/s-diol group in the uronate residues, yielding aldehyde groups and conformational chances to the polymer chain (figure 13) that, as mentioned before, significantly influence the backbone scission. As result of this process there is a decrease in molecular weight of alginate dependent on pH and temperature of the medium. However the periodate oxidation of alginate has no effect on the ion binding properties of the polymer, making it suitable for many biomedical applications [39].\nFigure 13 - Outcome of the periodate oxidation of sodium alginate.\n1.4.6.\tNucleophilic addition and elimination with imine reduction by Sodium cyanoborohydride\nThis modification consists in taking advantage of the affinity between aldehydes and N-nucleophiles more specifically amines to confer the oxidized alginate with specific properties interesting for future application [16].\nThe reaction mechanism is constituted by two steps [40-43]:\n\u2022\tNucleophilic addition between and aldehyde and an amine group, resulting in and intermediate carbinolamine, which then dehydrates yielding a substituted imine;\n\u2022\tImine reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride, yielding a secondary amine group.\nA\nFigure 14 - Scheme of the reaction of nucleophilic addition and the reduction by Sodium cyanoborohydride.\nIn figure 14 is showed the reaction mechanism described before with two different sources of amine groups: in A it's 3-amino-7-Diethylaminocoumarin, a fluorescent product [44]; and in B is 2-aminoethyl methacrylate, a product that besides having a part as an amine provider has interesting properties as a functionalization way (acrylate groups).\nCHAPTER II\nEXPERIMENTAL WORK\n2.1.\tMaterials\nDextran (from Leuconostoc mesenteroides; Mw~10200 Da and Mw~70000 Da determined by size exclusion chromatography; Sigma-Aldrich ), Sodium Alginate (Mw~100-200 kDa; 65-70% guluronic acid and 25-35% mannuronic acid; Fluka BioChemika), carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium periodate (>99%; Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (>95%; Panreac), phosphate buffer solution (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium cyanoborohydride (>90%; Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., LTD.), methanol (>95%; Panreac), ethylene glycol (>99%; Sigma-Aldrich), 2-propanol (>99% Fisher Scientific UK Limited), 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (>90%; ACROS Organics), Calcium Chloride (>99%; Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water were used as received in the chemical modifications.\nPropargyl carbonylimidazole, 3-azidopropanol and 3-azidopropyl carbonylimidazole were synthesized according to literature [33]. They were used in the functionalization of dextran with alkyne and azide groups.\n3-amino-7-Diethylaminocoumarin was synthesized as described in the literature and used as source of amine groups for nucleophilic addition[44].\nDeuterium oxide (D2O) (Eurisotop; +1%TMS), deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (d6DMSO) (Eurisotop; +1%TMS) and deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) (Eurisotop;\n<4\n+1%TMS) were used as received in the chemical analysis as solvents for 'H NMR samples.\n2.2.\tCharacterization techniques\nIn this section will be explained the basic principles of the techniques used to characterize the products obtained throughout the experimental work.\n\u25a04\n2.2.1.\tNuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ('H NMR)\nThe 'H NMR spectroscopy is a technique that facilitates the understanding of the chemical behaviour of a given sample when exposed to a powerful magnetic field and irradiated with radiofrequency radiation [45].\nWhen a magnetic field is applied on the sample, the nuclei of non-null nuclear spin tend to align and to acquire the orientation of the same or the opposite direction of the applied field. At this point, the irradiation of the nuclei with radiofrequency radiation causes their spins to transit to a higher level of energy. The absorbed and emitted energy is then quantified and represented in a spectrum [45, 46].\nThis spectrum data allows the characterization of the chemical products both in a quantitative and a qualitative way.\nProton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectra were obtained at 25\u00b0C in a Varian Unity 600 MHz Spectrometer using a 3 mm broadband NMR probe, in Deuterated Tetrahydrofuran (THF-d8). Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference.\n2.2.2.\tFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nThis analytical technique is very useful for the identification and characterization of the functional groups present in a given sample. This identification is based on the detection of the vibrations caused by the interaction between the atoms of the sample and the incident infra-red (IR) radiation [45].\nWith the incidence of IR radiation on the sample, it is obtained a spectrum that shows the fraction of radiation absorbed in a particular energy range, compared to a reference spectrum of energy absorbance recorded previously with no samples. Each functional group exhibits a specific vibration frequency so in the spectrum this specific vibration corresponds to a distinct energy peak, allowing the identification of the group [45].\nFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra were carried out in a FTIR-4200 spectrophotometer by Jasco recorded at a wavelength comprised between 550 and 4000 cm-1 and with 4 cm-1 resolution. Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) mode was used.\n2.2.3.\tUltraviolet-Visible spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy\nThis technique was used to obtain absorption spectra from fluorescent compounds. It consists in the incidence of a beam of light with wavelength ranging between 200 and 800 nm in a sample which causes molecules to undergo electronic transitions from ground to excited state. The spectrophotometer registers the amount of energy (photons) absorbed during this excitation process for the range of wavelengths [47].\nFluorescence spectroscopy is a complementary technique to Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. The basic principle behind this technique is to use a beam of light to excite the molecules of a certain sample from ground state, to the excited electronic state and then register the loss of energy in the return to the ground state as light emission [47].\nThe devices used were:\n\u2022\tShimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer (UV-visible spectrophotometry);\n\u2022\tPerkin Elmer Fluorescence Spectrometer LS45.\n2.3.\tProcedures\nThis section consists in detailing every experimental procedure realized during this investigation work.\n2.3.1.\tSynthesis of Propargyl Carbonylimidazole (PA-Cl)\nThis procedure was carried out as it was described in the literature [33].In a dry round bottomed flask were charged 14.59 g (90 mmol) CDI and 100 ml dichloromethane yielding a turbid suspension, followed by the addition of 2.89 ml (50 mmol) propargyl alcohol under vigorous stirring yielding a clear solution upon dissolution of the propargyl alcohol. The reaction time was 1 hour at room temperature.\nThe mixture was then extracted three times with 17.5 ml water. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate was then filtered and the resultant liquid was evaporated by rotary evaporation yielding the final product as a dry powder.\n2.3.2.\tSynthesis of 3-azidopropanol\nThe synthesis of this compound was carried out according to literature [48]. An aqueous solution of 3-Chloropropanol (14.96 ml; 16.95 g; 0.179 mol), sodium azide (23.278 g; 0.358 mol) and tetrabutylammoniumhydrogen sulfate (0.5 g) was prepared and stirred at 80\u00b0C for 24h followed by overnight stirring at room temperature.\nThe resulting solution was then three times extracted with 50 ml ether and dried with sodium sulfate. Ether was evaporated by rotary evaporation and the remaining liquid was purified by vacuum distillation yielding the final product.\n2.3.3.\tSynthesis of 3-azidopropyl carbonylimidazole (AP-Cl)\nIn a dry round bottomed flask were charged 9.12 g (0.0562 mol) CDI and 100 ml ethyl acetate resulting in a turbid suspension. Under a vigorous stirring, 3.48 ml (0.0375 mol, 3.79 g) 3-azidopropanol was added dropwise as the dissolution takes place the solution becomes clear. The reaction time was 2 hours at room temperature [33].\nThe solution was then extracted three times with 100 ml of distilled water. The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate and subsequently filtered. The solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporation and the final product was obtained as a liquid.\n2.3.4.\tSynthesis of dextran-propargylcarbonate (dex-C^C)\nIn a dry round bottom flask was charged 20 ml of anhydrous DMSO in which was dissolved 1 g dextran (corresponding to 6.167 mmol glucopyranose repeating units). To this solution were added 280 mg (1.86 mmol) PA-CI and the mixture was stirred overnight at 50\u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere.\nThe resulting mixture was then poured into dialysis bags (Mw cut off 3.5 kDa) and dialysed against distilled water for 5 days. The mixture was then lyophilized yielding a white fluffy powder as final product.\n2.3.5.\tSynthesis of dextran-azidopropylcarbonate (dex-N3)\n1\tg of dextran (corresponding to 6.167 mmol glucopyranose repeating units) was dissolved in 20 ml anhydrous DMSO, in a round bottom flask.\nTo this solution were added 1.204 g (6.16 mmol) AP-CI and the reaction was stirred overnight at 50\u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere.\nSubsequently the reaction mixture was put in dialysis bags (Mw cut off 3.5 kDa) and dialysed against pure water for 5 days. After lyophilization the final product was obtained as a white fluffy powder.\nThis procedure was also carried out in sodium alginate with the same steps and specifications.\n2.3.6.\tSynthesis of CDI modified dextran\nThis synthesis is very similar to the procedures of synthesis of dex-C=C and dex-N3. However there was an alteration in the order of events, being first the activation of dextran with CDI and then the functionalization with alkyne and azide groups.\nIn a round bottom flask was charged 1 g of dextran (corresponding to 6.167 mmol glucopyranose repeating units) and it was dissolved in 20 ml DMSO. To the mixture were added 200 mg CDI and the reaction was stirred overnight at 40\u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere.\nThe mixture is then precipitated with 2-propanol and immediately filtered and subsequently dried under vacuum yielding the final product as a white hard powder.\nThe step of functionalization requires the dissolution of the sample in DMSO and then the addition to the solution of 3-azidopropanol or propargyl alcohol as sources of azide and alkyne groups respectively. This step follows the procedure explained before in sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5.\n2.3.7.\tPeriodate oxidation of dextran\nA solution of Dextran (Mw~70000 Da) with 12.5% concentration (1 g Dextran/8 ml distilled water) was prepared in a round bottom flask. To this solution were added 3 ml of a sodium periodate solution with 177.33 mg/ml concentration in order to obtain approximately 27% degree of oxidation.\nThe reaction time was 24 hours under magnetic stirring, ambient temperature and in the dark.\nNeutralization of the mixture was made by adding 1 ml of ethylene glycol for 15 minutes. Then it was dialysed against water for 3 days and subsequently lyophilized yielding a white \u201cfluffy\u201d product.\n2.3.8.\tPeriodate oxidation of sodium alginate\nTo a solution of sodium alginate (1g; 40 ml distilled water) was added 1.08 g of sodium periodate. The mixture was magnetically stirred for 24 hours in the dark.\nThe reaction was then neutralized with 2 ml ethylene glycol for 15 minutes.\nTo start the purification process 500 mg of sodium chloride and 60 ml ethanol were added in order to obtain a precipitate. The resulting polymer was dissolved in 20 ml distilled water again and re-precipitated by addition of 40 ml ethanol. This step was repeated three times. The precipitates were pump filtered and dried at room temperature under vacuum.\n2.3.9.\tSynthesis of 3-amino-7-Diethylaminocoumarin\nIn a round bottom flask with magnetic stirring were poured 5 ml of HCl 37.4% and slowly added SnCl2 (1.6 g; 7.12 mmol) until it became a colorless solution.\n3-nitro-7-diethylaminocoumarin (Coumarin-NO2) was very slowly added in small portions for a period of 30 minutes. The reaction occurred for 4 hours at room temperature.\nThe solution (yellowish) is placed in an ice bath in order to cool down up to 3 to 5\u00b0C, and then an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (5 M) was slowly added to obtain alkaline pH. With this addition the colour of the solution changed, yielding a darker (reddish) colour and the formation of a precipitated.\nThe extraction was achieved by adding diethyl ether (2x25 ml). Then the organic and aqueous phases were separated (the organic phase was yellow and the other one had the precipitated).\nThe organic phase was washed with 50 ml distilled water, dried with sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated in the rotary evaporator, yielding a pasty residue which was then triturated with hexane to obtain a solid compound.\n2.3.10.\tNucleophilic addition between oxidized dextran and oxidized sodium alginate and 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin\n500 mg of oxidized dextran were dissolved in 10 ml phosphate buffer saline (PBS). To that mixture was added 1 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3).\nSeparately, 2 mg of 7-diethylamino-3-amino coumarin were dissolved in 1 ml ethanol. This solution was then added dropwise to the first one in order for the two of them to mix slowly. The reaction was stirred for 24 hours in the dark and with ambient temperature.\nThe solution was then poured into dialysis bags (Mw cut off 3.5kDa) and dialysed against water for 3 days. At last the liquid was lyophilized to obtain a yellow \u201cfluffy\u201d product.\nThe same procedure was applied to oxidized alginate changing some quantities: 200 mg oxidized alginate; 10 ml PBS; 3 mg NaCNBH3 and 2.64 mg 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin dissolved in 1 ml methanol.\n2.3.11.\tSynthesis of Alginate/Modified oxidized alginate beads\nA solution of sodium alginate and oxidized alginate with concentration 1% (80 mg sodium alginate; 20mg oxidized alginate; 10 ml distilled water) was prepared. This solution was stirred at approximately 250 rpm. 200 ml of a Calcium Chloride solution with 0.05 M of concentration were previously prepared also.\nIn a beaker cup were poured 50ml of the second solution, subsequently 2.5 ml of the first solution were added dropwise with the help of a needle, yielding beads with the size of the droplets. This procedure is portrayed in figure 15.\nFigure 15 - Schematics of the synthesis of the alginate/modified oxidized alginate beads.\n2.3.12.\tNucleophilic addition between oxidized sodium alginate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate\nThe procedure used to obtain this product cannot be specified due to protection of intellectual property.\nCHAPTER III\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn this chapter will be described and discussed all the results obtained throughout this work. For better understanding it is crucial to divide the experimental work in three parts.\nThe first part consisted in the attempt of modification of dextran with PA-Cl and AP-Cl in order to functionalize dextran with alkyne and azide groups, based on the information present in literature [33]. The modification using AP-Cl was also carried out in sodium alginate. In this phase of the experimental work was also tried a modification of dextran directly with CDI and after a functionalization with propargyl alcohol and 3-azidopropanol.\nThe second concerned the periodate oxidation of dextran and sodium alginate with the objective taking advantage of the reactive characteristics of the aldehyde groups present in the structure of these polymers repeating units after this procedure [16, 34-36, 49].\nThe use of the polymers obtained in the second part of the work leaded to the third phase which consisted in the use of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin (fluorescent) as sources of amine groups for nucleophilic addition and reductive amination (reduction of imine group to a secondary amine by sodium cyanoborohydride) with oxidized dextran and oxidized sodium alginate in order to try to synthesize a fluorescent probe of interest for encapsulation purposes. In this phase was also carried a procedure between oxidized sodium alginate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate as a source of amine groups for the same type of reaction to obtain a functionalized product with methacrylate reactive groups.\n3.1. Modifications with alkyne and azide groups\nThe procedures realized in this part of the work were based on the literature with some alterations on the scale of the reactions and the quantities of the reagents used in some of the processes (see appendix A) [33].\nThe first products to be synthesized were the 3-azidopropranol (key ingredient in the synthesis of AP-Cl), PA-Cl and AP-Cl because of their importance in the modification process. These three products were synthesized with success as expected and as it is described in sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.2.3. The 1H NMR results of these reactions is shown in appendix B.\nThe following step was to take advantage of the imidazole group of PA-Cl and AP-Cl to graft these products into the dextran and sodium alginate backbones. With dextran were tried the two modifications, with azide and alkyne groups, as to alginate only the one, with the azide groups.\nAfter the 'H NMR analysis of the modified polymers it was very difficult to evaluate the success of the reactions because the characteristic peaks for the azide and alkyne groups were not visible as expected. However it was possible to notice the presence of imidazole characteristic peaks in some spectra.\nFigure 16 - 1HNMR spectra of dextran (Mw~10200) and dextran after the attempt of modification with AP-Cl.\nThis result is portrayed in figure 16 were the imidazole peaks (6 = 7.45 ppm and 8.66 ppm) are clearly visible. The appearance of this imidazole groups in the structure of the modified polymer gave place for a rethinking of the modification process, because the dialysis, during the synthesis of this compounds, should be responsible for the elimination of any remains of imidazole. The appearance of these signals can be an evidence of the attachment of imidazole to the polymer.\nThis fact repeated itself in the modification of sodium alginate as we can see in figure 17.\n9.0\t8.5\t8.0\t7.5\t7.0\t6.5\t6.0\t5.5\t5.0\t4.5\t4.0\t3.5\t3.0\t2.5\t2.0\t1.5\t1.0\t0.5\t0.0\t-0.5\nfl (PPm)\nFigure 17 - 1HNMR spectra of sodium alginate and the attempt of modification of sodium alginate with AP-Cl.\nThe results of the modification of dextran with PA-Cl are shown in appendix C as they are inconclusive in order to evaluate the modification.\nThe next step was to explain the reason of the appearance those imidazole groups in the structure of the polymer. So we came up with the most reasonable theory that in the reaction process, the AP-Cl molecule instead of breaking the C-N bond yielding the azide groups to the dextran backbone, it was breaking the C-O\nbond yielding the imidazole groups instead of the azide. This mechanism is shown in figure 18. In appendix D are presented the FTIR spectra that confirm this result.\nFigure 18 - Schematics of the modification of dextran with AP-Cl. (1) Shows how the modification was intended and expected and (2) shows how it occurred.\nWith this in mind, it was decided to do some changes to the modification process. The aim was to invert the order of the reaction in order to first modify dextran with CDI to obtain imidazole groups in the dextran backbone, since it was already achieved in the previous procedure, and then input the azide and alkyne groups by taking advantage of the previously grafted imidazole group.\nThe reaction conditions were pretty similar to the ones applied in the first modifications. However CDI proved to have a large affinity to dextran and the result of this was the formation of a cross-linked gel. To avoid the formation of this compound, were tested several reactions varying the amount of CDI added. Nonetheless the formation of the gel was constant as we can see in table 4.\nTable 4 - Data regarding the amounts of dextran and CDI used in the testing of the formation of the dextran-CDI gel.\nReaction\tDextran (Mw~70 kDa) (g)\tCDI (g)\tMolar ratio\tGel formation\n1\t0.5\t0.8\t1.6\tPositive\n2\t1\t0.3\t0.3\tPositive\n3\t0.5\t0.1\t0.2\tPositive\nThe products obtained by these procedures were not soluble in any of the solvents available for NMR analysis, so the characterization was made by FTIR spectroscopy. The possible explanation for this crosslinking was the fact that the high reactivity of imidazole groups cause the dextran chains to react on both sides of the CDI molecule. This process is shown in figure 19.\nThe FTIR spectra of this product are shown in appendix E, and it shows a band that can be attributed to the carbonate group yielded by the cross-linking reaction. This modification falls a bit off the objective intended when it was realized. However the properties of the product obtained are susceptible to be interesting for other applications out of the scope of this work. With these results in mind, it was crucial to choose another path to input some modifications to the polymers in hand.\n3.2. Periodate oxidation of dextran and sodium alginate\nThe periodate oxidation of dextran and sodium alginate can be contextualized in a new strategy adopted after the results obtained so far. The decision was to synthesize fluorescent compounds out of dextran and sodium alginate that could be good alternatives to the already existing. This strategy was in accordance to the needs of the Ph. D. work that contextualizes this project.\nThe first step to obtain these fluorescent compounds was to oxidized both polymers with sodium periodate. The procedures of oxidation were carried out according to the literature [16, 34-36, 49]. However some changes had to be made\nto the procedures described, like a scale down in the quantities of the reagents. The procedures were carried out as described in sections 2.3.7 and 2.3.8.\nThe expected outcome of these reactions was, as described earlier, to confer the structures of both polymers with aldehyde groups for further use in nucleophilic addition followed by reductive amination.\nThe results of these reactions were oxidized dextran and oxidized sodium alginate with oxidation degree of approximately 27% and 19% respectively.\nThe confirmation of the oxidation process was achieved by FTIR\nd\nspectroscopy. Initially were acquired 'H NMR spectra of the oxidized samples, however the results of this analysis were inconclusive because the formation of hemiacetals (a more stable structure) between the oxidized units and their vicinities in the chains of the polymers makes it impossible to observe the aldehyde\nd\ncharacteristic peaks [16]. The 1H NMR spectra of the oxidized polymers are shown\nFigure 20 - FTIR spectrum of oxidized (blue) and regular sodium alginate (black).\nIn figure 20 is shown the result of the oxidation of sodium alginate, as it is\nd\nvisible the aldehyde characteristic band is approximately at 1739.39 cm-1, very d\nclose to the reference value of 1730 cm-1 referred in the literature [50].\nConcerning the oxidation of dextran, figure 21 shows the FTIR spectrum resultant of this procedure. It is visible a low intensity signal corresponding to the\nd\naldehyde functionalities at 1732.73 cm-1, thus confirming the theoretical value of\nd\n1730 cm-1 as expected and described in the literature [38]. The low intensity of the characteristic signal is explained by the low degree of oxidation and also the formation of the hemiacetal structures within the structure of oxidized dextran, making it very hard to observe the aldehyde groups in the spectrum [16, 38].\nWith the confirmation of the success of the oxidation procedures, the first step of this new pathway was complete. The next step was to use the functional groups obtained to attach the fluorescent compound into the polymers structure.\n3.3.\tNucleophilic addition between 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin and the oxidized polymers\nIn this phase of the work the objective was to use the affinity between the aldehyde groups of the oxidized polymers and the amine groups of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin to confer fluorescent properties to the modified polymers.\nThe reaction mechanism is described in section 1.4.6, and basically involves a nucleophilic addition between the aldehyde and amine groups with subsequent reductive amination in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride [51].\nAs mentioned in section 2.3.9 the quantities of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin (NH2 - Coumarin) used in the procedures were very low, this is due to the fact that for higher values of this product in solution it was observed the formation of an unknown precipitate (when the two solutions are mixed) which influences negatively the properties of the final product. In table 5 and 6 are shown some data about this fact for both polymers.\nTable 5 - Reaction data regarding the formation of a precipitate in oxidized dextran nucleophilic addition.\nReaction\tOxidized Dextran (g)\tNH2 -Coumarin (g)\tMolar Ratio\tPrecipitate\n1\t0.202\t0.0576\t0.285\tPositive\n2\t0.0404\t0.014\t0.24\tPositive\n3\t0.5\t0.003\t4.2x10-3\tNegative\nTable 6 - Reaction data regarding the formation of a precipitate in oxidized alginate nucleophilic addition.\nReaction\tOxidized Alginate (g)\tNH2 -Coumarin (g)\tMolar Ratio\tPrecipitate\n1\t0.0808\t0.01858\t0.19\tPositive\n2\t0.101\t0.0202\t0.17\tPositive\n3\t0.1\t0.003\t0.025\tNegative\nBecause of the low amount of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin used in the reactions, the results from 'H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy are not conclusive about the success of the modification (see appendix F). Nonetheless when exposed to UV radiation (366nm wavelength) the samples showed fluorescence (figure 22), also the existence of some fluorescent material in the dialysis disposal water suggests that the fluorescent material is linked to the structure and not only adsorbed.\nFig ure 22 - Aqueous solutions of modified oxidized dextran (A) and oxidized alginate (B) exposed to UV radiation.\nThe fluorescence seen in the pictures of figure 22 leaded to further investigation about the fluorescence properties of these compounds.\nThe first step was to obtain an absorbance spectrum by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry in order to get to know the peaks of maximum absorbance of radiation by the samples. The results of this analysis (figure 23) were the following:\n\u2022\tFor modified oxidized dextran were recorded two absorbance maximums, the first at 237 nm and the second at 393 nm;\n\u2022\tFor modified oxidized alginate only one maximum was registered at 280 nm.\nFigure 23 - Absorbance spectrum for the modified polymers, dextran (red) and alginate (blue).\nThe previous analysis yielded important information about the fluorescent behaviour of the samples. The next step was to use this information to produce an emission and an excitation spectrum to complete the fluorescence study.\nThe emission spectrum showed the wavelength of the fluorescence emission maximum, is to say the spectrum of emission wavelengths while the excitation light is kept constant in the absorbance maximum wavelengths. The excitation spectrum is obtained with the emission light kept constant in the emission maximum and the excitation light scanning the wavelengths.\nThe results of this emission and excitation where obtained with a fluorescence spectrophotometer and the results are showed in figures 24 and 25.\nFigure 24 - Fluorescence spectra obtained from oxidized dextran modified with 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin:\nexcitation spectrum (blue) and emission spectrum (black)\nFigure 25 - Fluorescence spectra obtained from oxidized alginate modified with 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin:\nexcitation spectrum (black) and emission spectrum (blue).\nThe results shown that both products have very similar properties in terms of fluorescence with excitation maximums of approximately 380 nm wavelength and emission maximums of about 500 nm. This data shows the consistency of the procedure of modification for both oxidized polymers. When compared to the fluorescence data obtained from 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin (see appendix G) we can see that the obtained results are pretty consistent with the presence of this compound in the structure of the oxidized polymers.\nTo further investigate the effect of these modifications on the properties of the original polymers we decided to use one of them, specifically the modified oxidized alginate, to produce alginate beads and see if not only the ion binding properties remained intact but also if the obtained beads would be fluorescent.\nThe procedure of producing the beads is described in section 2.3.11.\nFigure 26 - Fluorescent alginate/modified oxidized alginate beads.\nFigure 26 shows pictures of the Alginate/Modified oxidized alginate (80%/20%) beads obtained. It is clearly visible that the beads are fluorescent. Although the fluorescence intensity could be higher if there was available a UV lamp with an excitation wavelength closer to the 380 nm approximate maximum. This excitation was made at 366 nm. It was also attempted to capture the fluorescence with the help of a fluorescence microscope (see appendix H). However the excitation wavelength of the microscope (~494 nm) does not allow the visualization of the beads because it is too distant from the 380 nm of the\nproduct excitation peak. Nonetheless these results proved that besides all the modification steps and new properties acquired, the products obtained possess some of the good properties of the original polymers which grant their usefulness in the same kind of applications.\n3.4.\tNucleophilic addition between 2-aminoethyl methacrylate and oxidized alginate\nThe results obtained in this modification are not able to be disclosed for protection of intellectual property reasons.\nCHAPTER IV\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nConcerning the modification of dextran and sodium alginate with alkyne and azide groups it was difficult to synthesize the products described in the literature. Furthermore the reproducibility of the process was not quite good and alternatives had to be found.\nWith the results in hand it was decided to realize further procedures with some changes on the order of the reactions to try to achieve the modification by a different path. This pathway leaded to the production of a cross-linked polymer (gel) that can contain interesting properties. The properties of this product were not extensively explored due to time limitation and the focus of the work turned to other direction.\nThe change in strategy guided the line of work towards the production of fluorescent natural based polymers that could have an interesting application spectrum in uses that require fluorescence to identify structures.\nThe synthesis of these products involved two phases. The first was the periodate oxidation of dextran and sodium alginate; the second phase was the reaction between the aldehydes of the oxidized polymers and the amines of 3-amino-7-diethylamiocoumarin. The two phases were carried out of this synthesis were successfully accomplished.\nThe subsequent study of the fluorescence properties of the obtained products showed that they were very well defined and specific in accordance with the fluorescence values of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin. However it is obvious to conclude that in terms of applications this product has very specific parameters, requiring very specific excitation wavelengths (approximately 380 nm) that sit on the borderline of the most commonly used filter combinations (FITC-Red Texas; DAPI-FITC; FITC-TRITC and DAPI-FITC-TRITC). Nonetheless it has interesting properties for use in applications that involve the formation of particles and encapsulation.\nAnother use given to the oxidized alginate previously synthesized was the functionalization with methacrylate groups, using a procedure based on the same principles as the one applied for the fluorescent products. The 2-aminoethyl methacrylate modified oxidized alginate was successfully obtained. This modification yields a functionalized product that can be very useful in various biomedical applications.\nOther advantages of these products are:\n\u2022\tlow cost;\n\u2022\tThey are easy to produce and do not require a lot of specific reactions conditions (ambient temperature, normal atmosphere);\n\u2022\tEasy to use (water soluble, easy to manipulate, non-toxic);\n\u2022\tDistinct features (fluorescence, functional groups in their structures).\nFor future work it would be interesting to develop two aspects resulting of this work. The first aspect is the necessity of a complete study of the properties of the cross-linked polymer obtained by the direct modification of dextran with CDI. The extensive knowledge of this product's properties (i.e. \u201cswelling\u201d capacity, chain mobility among others) may result in the discovery of a product with high interest for biomedical application. The second aspect worthy of future development is the use of the fluorescent products as well as the 2-aminoethyl methacrylate modified oxidized alginate in studies involving the encapsulation of cells or bioactive agents and also investigate their usefulness in drug delivery systems.\nREFERENCES\n1.\tvan Dijk, M., et al., Synthesis and applications of biomedical and pharmaceutical polymers via click chemistry methodologies.

However only one band is clearly visible (1720.19 cm-1) , the other band his hidden by another band belonging to the polymer.\nFigure 31 - FTIR spectra of sodium alginate (black) and AP-Cl modified sodium alginate (blue).\nAppendix E: FTIR spectra of dextran directly modified with CDI\nApproximately between 1678 and 1837 cm-1 is visible the appearance of a band (figure 33) which can be attributed to a carbonate group formed in the crosslinking process.\nFigure 32 - Stacked FTIR spectra of dextran (Mw~70 kDa) (green) and two samples of dextran modified with CDI in different proportions (blue 0.1g CDI and Red 0.3g CDI).\nAppendix F: 1H NMR spectra of the oxidized dextran and sodium alginate\nFor both polymers, by the analysis of the NMR spectra (figure 33 and 34) it can be affirmed that the structure suffered some alterations. However there is no way to do a precise analysis, because the peaks of the fluorescent products are not visible.\nFigure 34 - Stacked 1H NMR spectra of the three different types of alginate (normal; oxidized and fluorescent).\nAppendix G: Fluorescence data for 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin\n1000\n300\t400\t500\t600\t700\t800\nWavelenght (nm)\nFigure 35 - Excitation (black; maximum at 380 nm) and emission (blue; maximum at (492 nm)) spectra of 3-amino-7-diethylaminocoumarin.\nAppendix H: Microscope and magnifier photos of the obtained beads\nFigure 36 - Photographs of the alginate/fluorescent alginate beads obtained with a magnifier (amplification 3.2x).\nFigure 37 - Photographs of the alginate/fluorescent alginate beads obtained with an optic microscope (amplification 40x).
