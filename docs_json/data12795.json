In Brazil, conodonts have been\nreported in Paleozoic basins with main attention to the\nPennsylvanian strata of Amazonas Basin, which comprises\nthe marine deposits of Tapaj\u00f3s Group - Monte Alegre, Itaituba\nand Nova Olinda formations. Among these formations the\nItaituba Formation has the thick carbonate marine strata of\nthe Tapaj\u00f3s Group been the focus of this study.\n\nSome species of the genus Diplognathodus have been\nregarded as useful for stratigraphic correlation of\nPennsylvanian strata because they have shown\nstratigraphically short ranges, like Diplognathodus\norphanus, typical of Atokan age. Outside North America the\ndistribution of this genus is still little known, whereas other\ngenera like Idiognathodus and Neognathodus have been\nwidely discussed and documented in the Carboniferous of\nNorth America and Europe.\n\nDiplognathodus distribution has been analyzed in the\nPennsylvanian of United States mainly by Merrill (1973), von\nBitter &amp; Merrill (1990) among others, in the Midcontinent\nregion, Appalachian and Illinois basins, by Bender (1980) in\nthe Canadian Arctic, by van den Boogaard (1983) in Western\nEurope and North Africa, by Wang Zhi-hao &amp; Qi Yu-ping\n(2002) in China, among others.\n\nIn South America, Diplognathodus has been found in\nBrazil in Pennsylvanian strata of the Amazonas Basin.\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis and D. orphanus were\nstudied by Lemos (1990) and Neis (1996) in wells collected\nby PETROBRAS. Later, studying an outcrop area of\nfossiliferous calcareous limestones in the southern part of\nthe Amazonas Basin, Scomazzon (1999) report the presence\nof D. orphanus in the lower portion of the Itaituba Formation\nand Nascimento et al. (2005) registered the occurrence of D.\ncoloradoensis in a quarry in this region, however in\nstratigraphically older marine deposits, suggesting an Atokan\nage to the studied interval.\n\nThis paper aim to record the Pa elements of Diplognathodus\n\n05_Art04_Scomazzon.pmd 28/11/2005, 13:56203\n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 8(3), 2005204\n\noccurrence in calcareous marine deposits of the Itaituba\nFormation, Pennsylvanian of the Amazonas Basin. We herein\npresent the occurrence of Pa elements of Diplognathodus\ncoloradoensis, D. orphanus and the first report of Pa elements\nof D. ellesmerensis in the Amazonas Basin.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe material here studied comes from four wells made by\nthe Brazilian oil company (PETROBRAS) in the Amazonas\nBasin (Figure 1). About 15 kg of carbonates from thirty-nine\nsamples were collected from the wells. Processing techniques\nfollowed the usual methodology of Austin (1987). Around\n400 g of each sample were used to process the material. From\nthe processed material 125 Pa elements of the genus\nDiplognathodus were studied (Table 1). Other elements like\nM and S ones were also found in the sediment analyzed, but\nthey were not herein considered because it is difficult to\nestablish whether they belong or not to Diplognathodus\napparatus. The conodonts studied herein are deposited in\nthe collection of the Departamento de Paleontologia e\nEstratigrafia, UFRGS under acronym MP-M.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe Amazonas Basin is a large intracratonic sedimentary\nbasin occupying 500 000 km2 within the northern Brazilian\nstates of Amazonas and Par\u00e1 (Figure 1). Three sectors are\ndistinguished trending generally east \u2013 west: the north\nplatform, the south platform and the central basin area. The\nPaleozoic sedimentary succession is limited by two\nPrecambrian Shields, the Guianas to the north and the Guapor\u00e9\nto the south of the Amazonian Craton (Tassinari &amp;\nMacambira, 1999). To the east, it is separated from the Maraj\u00f3\nBasin by the Gurup\u00e1 Arch, and to the west it is separated\nfrom Solim\u00f5es Basin by a subsurface basement-high, the N-\nS trending Purus Arch. The basin holds a Proterozoic through\nRecent sedimentary and sub-volcanic stratigraphic record\nup to 6,000 m thick, in the central area. The Carboniferous-\nPermian contribution accounts for more than half of the total\ndeposition (Caputo, 1984, Milani &amp; Zal\u00e1n, 1998).\n\nThe Pennsylvanian-Permian deposits are represented by\nthe Tapaj\u00f3s Group, which comprises the Monte Alegre,\nItaituba, Nova Olinda and Andir\u00e1 Formations. The Itaituba\nFormation, the focus of this paper, varies in thickness from\n110 m in the southern outcrops area to 420 m in the central\npart of the basin. This formation represents the establishment\nof widespread marine conditions. It consists of diverse\ncarbonate rocks including lime mudstones, wackestones,\npackstones, and oolitic and peloidal grainstones and includes\na rich faunal association with brachiopods, crinoids,\nbryozoans, corals, foraminifers, trilobites, ostracodes,\ngastropods, bivalves, scolecodonts, and fish teeth. Although\nconodonts are low in numbers, they are more abundant and\ndiverse in the Itaituba Formation than the other formations\nof the Tapaj\u00f3s Group, occurring in the three geographic areas\nof the Itaituba Formation.\n\nSYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY\n\nDiplognathodus Kozur &amp; Merrill in Kozur (1975)\n\nType species. Spathognathodus coloradoensis Murray &amp;\nChronic, 1965.\nDiagnosis. A sphatognathodid consisting anteriorly of a\nblade-like portion and posteriorly of an enlarged cup of\nsubelliptical shape, both portions separated orally by a\ndistinct notch. The blade\u2013like portion is formed by laterally\ncompressed denticles and extends anteriorly into a single\nrow of more rounded denticles an undenticulated carina.\n\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis (Murray &amp; Chronic, 1965)\n(Figures 2A, B)\n\nSpathognathodus coloradoensis Murray &amp; Chronic,\n1965: 606-607, pl. 72: 11-13; Webster, 1969: 44, pl. 7: 7; Merrill,\n1973: 304, pl. 3: 20-42.\n\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis (Murray &amp; Chronic);\nMerrill, 1975: 48-50, figs. 16: 40, 17: 16; Landing &amp; Wardlaw,\n1981: 1257-1259, pl. 1: 4, 5, 8.\n\nDescription. In lateral view unit small, slightly arched. In oral\nview blade with four to six denticles more or less uniform in\nlength, posterior part of the oral edge consisting of\napproximately one half of the total length composed of single\nspatula-like ridge (carina) which is separated from the\ndenticulate blade by a prominent notch. The carina is distinctly\nlower than the denticulate blade. In aboral view a large and\nsymmetrical basal cavity, deep beneath the carina and\ncontinuing as a groove along aboral surface of the blade.\nRemarks. This species is distinguished from D. orphanus in\nhaving a nondenticulate carina, the blade with uniform\ndenticles and not as high as in D. orphanus, and the\nprominent notch.\nMaterial. 39 specimens.\n\nDiplognathodus orphanus (Merrill, 1973)\n(Figures 2C, D)\n\nSpathognathodus orphanus Merrill, 1973: 309, pl. 3: 45-56.\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis (Murray &amp; Chronic); Landing\n&amp; Wardlaw, 1981, pl. 1: 1, 6, 7, 9, 10.\nDiplognathodus orphanus (Merrill, 1973); Grubbs, 1984: 69,\npl. 1: 4.\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis (Murray &amp; Chronic); Savage\n&amp; Barkeley, 1985: 1473, figs. 12: 9-16.\n\nDescription. In lateral view element slightly arched, anterior\nhalf of the unit up to twice as high as posterior half. The\ndenticles of the blade are higher than those of the carina.\nThey are fused about 2/3 of their length.

This point is comparable to the notch of the D.\ncoloradoensis. The denticles of the carina are almost uniform.\nThey increase slightly in inclination toward the posterior end\nforming a right angle to the aboral side of the unit. In oral\nview the unit is almost straight. In aboral view the basal cavity\nis deep, wide and subsymmetrical.\nRemarks. Diplognathodus orphanus is distinguished from\nD. coloradoensis by the latter having the prominent notch\nand by the carina; it is coarsely denticulate in the former and\n\nrelatively to nondenticulate (spatula) in the latter.\nMaterial. 42 specimens.\n\nDiplognathodus ellesmerensis Bender, 1980\n(Figures 2E, F)\n\nDiplognathodus ellesmerensis Bender, 1980: 9-10, pl. 4: 5-7,\n11, 15-21, 23-25.\nDiplognathodus orphanus (Merrill, 1973); Grubbs, 1984: 69,\npl. 1: 3.\n\nFigure 1.

In lateral view the specimens are small. The blade\nconsists of four to five denticles increasing in length toward\nthe posterior end of the blade. The apex of the basal cavity is\nunder the notch, which has in general one small denticle. The\nblade is twice as high as the posterior portion of the unit. In\nsome specimens the long axes of the denticles of the blade\nslightly diverge giving a particular appearance to the blade.\nThe denticles of the carina are low, the third or rarely the\nfourth denticle from the posterior end is the highest. In oral\nview the specimens are straight. In aboral view a broad and\nsymmetrical basal cavity extends from the posterior end to\nabout the aboral midpoint of the blade.\nRemarks. Diplognathodus ellesmerensis is distinguished\nfrom D. orphanus by unfused denticles of the carina, the\nposterior end is sharp and the posteriormost blade denticle\nis prominent pointing toward the carina.\nMaterial. 44 specimens.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe conodont fauna of the studied material comprises\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis, D. orphanus, D.\nellesmerensis, Idiognathodus incurvus, Idiognathoides\nsinuatus, Neognathodus bassleri, N. atokaensis, N.\nmedadultimus, N. roundyi and Adetognathus lautus.\n\nThe three Diplognathodus species studied were\nrecovered from the lower through the upper part of the Itaituba\nFormation. While D. orphanus and D. ellesmerensis are more\nabundant in the lower part, D. coloradoensis mainly occurs\nin the upper part of the formation. The latter species is\ncharacteristic of lower Desmoinesian, but its range is\nMorrowan to lower Desmoinesian (von Bitter &amp; Merrill, 1990).\nD. orphanus is typical of Atokan age. This species has been\nused to characterize this interval in North America by Grubbs\n(1984), von Bitter &amp; Merrill (1990), among others.\nDiplognathodus ellesmerensis was considered characteristic\nof Atokan by Bender (1980). However, van den Boogaard\n(1983) and von Bitter &amp; Merrill (1990) suggest that this species\nmay also range into the early Desmoinesian.\n\nThe occurrence of these species is extremely important\nto refine the Pennsylvanian of the Amazonas Basin.\nScomazzon (1999), suggested that the Atokan-Desmoinesian\nboundary is somewhere between the Itaituba and Nova\nOlinda Formations. However, the present conodonts were all\nconsidered of Atokan-early Desmoinesian age. Therefore,\n\nthe occurrence of the Atokan guide-form D. orphanus and\nother short-ranging conodont species are important for the\ndating of the Pennsylvanian strata.\n\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis, D. orphanus and D.\nellesmerensis have been considered to be morphotypes of\none species by Landing &amp; Wardlaw (1981) and Savage &amp;\nBarkeley (1985) and as separate species by van den Boogaard\n(1983), van den Boogaard &amp; Bless (1985), and von Bitter &amp;\nMerrill (1990) because of denticulate or undenticulated\nspatulas. Comparing and discussing the Pa elements of the\nspecimens found in this study we suggest that they belong\nto different Diplognathodus species because they have\ndistinct characteristics discussed in the systematic\npaleontology. For an extensive discussion related to inter-\nand intra-specific variation of Diplognathodus and its\nspeciation see von Bitter &amp; Merrill (1990).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDiplognathodus coloradoensis was found in the lower,\nmiddle and upper part of the Itaituba Formation. According\nto the accepted range of this species would be possible to\nsuggest a Morrowan to early Desmoinesian age to this\ninterval; however this species is main characteristic of early\nDesmoinesian. Nevertheless, the occurrence of\nDiplognathodus  orphanus and Diplognathodus\nellesmerensis in the lower and upper part of the formation\nhelp to refine the suggested age pointing to an Atokan age\nto this interval.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Nilo Matsuda (PETROBRAS) for his\nhelp with sample collection and discussions.
