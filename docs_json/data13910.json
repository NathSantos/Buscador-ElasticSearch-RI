Eles exercem um controle no tamanho e \n\nna din\u00e2mica de muitas esp\u00e9cies, no sentido dos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos mais baixos para os mais \n\naltos, ajudando na gest\u00e3o dos ecossistemas do oceano. Em resultado, o conhecimento da \n\necologia tr\u00f3fica de predadores marinhos torna-se crucial para compreender o importante \n\npapel que desempenham nos ecossistemas. Neste sentido, este estudo tem por objetivo \n\nestudar a ecologia alimentar de duas esp\u00e9cies de tubar\u00f5es de profundidade, Etmopterus \n\nspinax (Linnaeus, 1758) (lixinha da fundura) e Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) \n\n(xarinha preta), sobre as quais a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 muito escassa ou at\u00e9 inexistente. Assim, \n\nneste estudo s\u00e3o descritos os h\u00e1bitos alimentares de Etmopterus spinax e Etmopterus \n\npusillus, na costa do Algarve, a sul de Portugal. A fim de conhecer a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da dieta \n\nalimentar de cada esp\u00e9cie de tubar\u00e3o de profundidade, efectuaram-se an\u00e1lises de acordo \n\ncom o sexo,o estado de matura\u00e7\u00e3o dos indiv\u00edduos e as esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano para a esp\u00e9cie E. \n\nspinax e an\u00e1lises de acordo com o sexo para a esp\u00e9cie E. pusillus.  A sua dieta foi \n\ndeterminada atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise do conte\u00fado dos est\u00f4magos de 231 esp\u00e9cimes capturados \n\nacessoriamente por arrastos de crust\u00e1ceos, ao longo da costa do Algarve e no per\u00edodo \n\ncompreendido entre 1999-2000 e em 2015, tendo sido rejeitados devido ao seu baixo ou \n\nnulo valor comercial. Do total de esp\u00e9cimens analisados, 173 pertencem \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie E. \n\nspinax e os 58 restantes \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie E. pusillus. Os esp\u00e9cimes foram medidos (comprimento \n\ntotal) e pesados em laborat\u00f3rio, e o estado de matura\u00e7\u00e3o de cada um foi atribuido em \n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3odo comprimento da sua primeira matura\u00e7\u00e3o . Os est\u00f4magos foram pesados e \n\nabertos e o estado de digest\u00e3o dos seus conte\u00fados foram analisados seguindo uma escala \n\ncom cinco n\u00edveis de digest\u00e3o de acordo com o estado de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o em que as presas \n\nse encontravam. As presas ingeridas foram identificadas atrav\u00e9s de diferentes chaves \n\ntaxon\u00f3micas at\u00e9 ao menor n\u00edvel de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f3mica poss\u00edvel. Al\u00e9m disso, as \n\npresas mais afetadas pelo processo de digest\u00e3o foram identificadas pelas suas estruturas \n\nduras, como sejam os ot\u00f3litos no caso dos peixes e os bicos no caso dos cefal\u00f3podes. Esta \n\nan\u00e1lise foi realizada atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas tipos de an\u00e1lise, a saber: (1) an\u00e1lises \n\nquantitativas, como o m\u00e9todo num\u00e9rico (% N), o m\u00e9todo gravim\u00e9trico (% W) e a \n\nfrequ\u00eancia de ocorr\u00eancia (% FO); (2) an\u00e1lise mista, como o \u00cdndice de Import\u00e2ncia \n\nRelativa (IRI) e o \u00cdndice Alimentar Ponderado (IPO2); e (3) an\u00e1lise qualitativa, como a \n\nclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o das categorias de presas encontradas. De igual modo, tamb\u00e9m foram \n\n\n\nxii \n \n\naplicados seis tipos de an\u00e1lise complementar, como sejam os \u00edndices de diversidade \n\n(\u00edndice de Shannon), riqueza espec\u00edfica (\u00edndice de Margalef) e uniformidade de esp\u00e9cies \n\n(indice de Pielou), o \u00edndice de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica (\u00edndice de Schoener), o n\u00edvel tr\u00f3fico \n\ne o \u00edndice de vacuidade (VI). Al\u00e9m disso, foi realizada uma an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica \n\nmultivariada, mediante a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do software PRIMER V6.0, recorrendo ao uso de \n\ndiferentes testes (CLUSTERS, MSD, ANOSIM e SIMPER). Mediante estas an\u00e1lises, este \n\nestudo vem demonstrar a exist\u00eancia de uma sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica na dieta de E. spinax e \n\nE. pusillus, onde foi observado que a diversidade das esp\u00e9cies de presas encontradas nos \n\nconte\u00fados dos est\u00f4magos foi baixa, n\u00e3o existindo diferencas significativas entre as duas \n\ndietas (Mann-Whitney, p > 0,05), o que leva a sugerir que podem apresentar uma dieta \n\nseletiva.  Portanto foi poss\u00edvel observar a exist\u00eancia de uma certa homogeneidade na dieta \n\nalimentar entre as duas esp\u00e9cies de tubar\u00f5es de profundidade. Alem disso, os resultados \n\nobtidos neste estudo permitiram observar evid\u00eancias de que ambas as esp\u00e9cies partilham \n\nos mesmos recursos se bem que em propor\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes. Ambas as esp\u00e9cies \n\nalimentaram-se principalmente de tr\u00eas grupos de presas: crust\u00e1ceos, peixes e cefal\u00f3podes. \n\nAs principais presas encontradas na dieta dos tubar\u00f5es de profundidade em estudo \n\nconsistiram em organismos da subordem Natantia (presas preferenciais), peixes n\u00e3o \n\nidentificados (presas secund\u00e1rias) e cefal\u00f3podes (presas acess\u00f3rias) no caso de E. spinax. \n\nEnquanto que as principais presas encontradas na dieta de E. pusillus foram peixes n\u00e3o \n\nidentificados (presas preferenciais), organismos da subordem Natantia (presas \n\nsecund\u00e1rias) e cefal\u00f3podes (presas acess\u00f3rias). Para al\u00e9m disso, encontrou-se um n\u00famero \n\nelevado de est\u00f4magos vazios que se veio a reflectir num elevado valor de vacuidade em \n\nambos os tubar\u00f5es, podendo este facto estar relacionado, com a dura\u00e7\u00e3o dos arrastos (de \n\nv\u00e1rias horas), na medida em que o per\u00edodo de longas horas em que a embarca\u00e7\u00e3o vai \n\narrastando no fundo pode ser que seja o suficiente para que haja uma completa digest\u00e3o \n\ndos est\u00f4magos, tornando os seus conte\u00fados n\u00e3o identific\u00e1veis. N\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7as \n\nsignificativas na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da dieta de E. pusillus de acordo com o sexo (ANOSIM, \n\np>0,05).  Para E. spinax tambem n\u00e3o foram encontradas diferen\u00e7as de acordo com o sexo \n\ne a esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano (ANOSIM, p>0,05). Al\u00e9m disso, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7as de \n\nacordo com o estado de matura\u00e7\u00e3o , apresentando a dieta entre esp\u00e9cimes imaturos e \n\nmaturos uma elevada variabilidade (ANOSIM, R=0,05, p<0.05).  No entanto, no caso dos \n\nesp\u00e9cimes maduros de ambos os sexos de E. spinax foi poss\u00edvel observar uma ligeira \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o da dieta alimentar. A dieta consistiu principalmente de pequenos crust\u00e1ceos para \n\nos esp\u00e9cimes imaturos, mudando a sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o para presas potencialmente maiores, \n\n\n\nxiii \n \n\ncomo peixes, para esp\u00e9cimes maduros. Esta mudan\u00e7a na dieta alimentar pode ser causada \n\npor varia\u00e7\u00f5es ontog\u00e9nicas, uma vez que a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 relacionada com o tamanho \n\nda boca, a capacidade de armazenamento do est\u00f4mago e a capacidade de nata\u00e7\u00e3o de cada \n\nindiv\u00edduo; e tamb\u00e9m pela necessidade de obter a energia necess\u00e1ria de acordo com o ciclo \n\nreprodutivo em que se encontra. Consequentemente, o fato de os esp\u00e9cimes maiores \n\nconsumirem presas maiores pode ajudar a reduzir a competi\u00e7\u00e3o entre indiv\u00edduos da \n\nmesma esp\u00e9cie ou de esp\u00e9cies diferentes. Por outro lado, em termos de sazonalidade, os \n\ncrust\u00e1ceos continuaram a  fazer parte da dieta principal de E. spinax. O fato de n\u00e3o se \n\nterem encontrado diferen\u00e7as significativas entre a sazonalidade e a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da dieta \n\nde E. spinax pode ser devido \u00e0 estabilidade da temperatura no meio. As varia\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ntemperatura s\u00e3o geralmente grandes na superf\u00edcie e m\u00ednimas a grandes profundidades, de \n\nmodo que podem afectar na composi\u00e7\u00e3o das presas, nas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es de abund\u00e2ncia e/ou as \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o na coluna de \u00e1gua. Finalmente, os resultados obtidos neste \n\nestudo foram comparados com os de outros autores, verificando-se algumas diferen\u00e7as, \n\nno que respeita \u00e0 dieta alimentar entre  E. spinax e E. pusillus. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxiv \n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe knowledge about the trophic ecology of marine predators is crucial to understand \n\ntheir ecological role in ecosystems. In this study, the feeding ecology of two small deep \n\nwater Lanternsharks, Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) and Etmopterus pusillus \n\n(Lowe, 1839), from the Algarve coast, south Portugal, was analysed. In order to better \n\nunderstand their diet composition, this study included an evaluation by sex, maturity stage \n\nand seasonality. For this purpose, the stomach contents of 173 E. spinax and 58 E. pusillus \n\nindividuals were analysed. Through univariate quantitative analysis as well as occurrence \n\npercent by number (%N), weight (%W) and frequency of occurrence (%FO) and mixed \n\nanalysis as Relative Importance Index (%IRI) and Weighted Food Index (IPO2) of prey \n\nitems were obtained for both deep-water shark species. Also, additional indices such as \n\noverlap index, trophic level, vacuity index, diversity, richness and evenness indices were \n\nused. Besides a statistical analysis was performed through multivariate analysis with \n\nSoftware PRIMER V6.0, using different tests (CLUSTERS, MSD, ANOSIM and \n\nSIMPER). Through the results obtained by these analysis there seems to exist a trophic \n\noverlap in the diet of these deep-water shark species, with a low diversity, richness and \n\nevenness of prey species in their stomach contents. Thereby, it is possible to suggest that \n\nthey are selective predators. Mainly crustaceans, fish and cephalopods were found in their \n\ndiets. In general, it was observed that E. spinax has a preference for crustaceans (mainly \n\nNatantia organisms), followed by fish (unidentified fish) and cephalopods (unidentified \n\ncephalopods) as accessory prey. However, in case of E. pusillus the preference for fish \n\n(mainly unidentified fish), followed by crustaceans (Natantia organisms) and \n\ncephalopods (unidentified cephalopods) as accessory prey. On the other hand, the sex, \n\nmaturity and season variables were not significant sources of variation in the diet of E. \n\nspinax species. In the same way, no significant differences concerning sex was observed \n\nfor E. pusillus diet. Finally, the results obtained in this study were compared with the \n\nsome author studies verifying some differences with regard to the diet of E. spinax and \n\nE. pusillus.  \n\nKey words: Etmopterus spinax, Etmopterus pusillus, Algarve, feeding ecology, stomach \n\ncontents analysis, trophic level. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxv \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1                                          INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. General introduction \n\nThere have been long, large changes on different time scales that have affected \n\nmarine communities. In the case of benthic marine assemblages, they have experienced \n\ngradual long-term changes related to climate and sea level oscillations (Cartes et al., \n\n2013). These changes have not only affected various taxonomic levels but also trophic \n\ngroups, causing changes in the habitat and the ecological dynamics of benthic \n\ncommunities. However, despite all these changes, the sharks have been swimming in the \n\noceans of the world for more than 400 million years (Griffin, 2008). \n\nThe Chondrichthyes class, including cartilaginous fish, sharks, rays and \n\nchimaeras, is a very old and successful group of jawed fish, which currently contains \n\nbetween 900 and 1100 know living species (Compagno, 1990). They show a highly \n\nmorphological diversity during most of their evolutionary development from the \n\nPaleozoic to the present days. It is important to know that they are relatively large \n\npredators which have remained in a competitive environment such as marine ecosystems. \n\nCartilaginous fish are highly diverse and they show different life-history styles to which \n\nthey have to adapt. Usually they are large migratory which are distributed in all types of \n\nmarine environments with different characteristics (Compagno, 1990).  \n\nElasmobranchs are top predators, playing an important role in the marine \n\necosystems with a top-down control on the size and dynamics of many species (Valls et \n\nal., 2011). Top predators keep all species bellow them in the trophic chain, because they \n\ndirectly limit the populations of their prey and help to manage healthy ocean ecosystems, \n\nincluding seagrass beds and coral reefs (Griffin et al., 2008). Furthermore, they exploit a \n\nwide range of habitats, from epipelagic to deep-sea benthic environments (Xavier et al., \n\n2012). Nowadays, populations of sharks are being decimated by commercial fishing, and \n\nsome species are vulnerable to extinction (Lopez et al., 2009), because sharks usually \n\ntend to have a slow growth rate, late age of maturity and low fecundity. This means that \n\nthey follow a K-selected life-history strategy (Stevens et al., 2000), so their recruitment \n\nis directly dependent on the size of stock. These reasons determine that some populations \n\nwill probably not be able to recover quickly from overexploitation, thus harming the \n\nsustainability of fisheries (Stevens et al., 2000). \n\nThe pressure of fisheries induces special vulnerability in species, and in low-\n\nproductivity habitats such as deep-sea, mainly due to the fast growth of this industry and \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nthe by-catch. Each year, humans kill more than 100 million sharks worldwide, this \n\nincludes the tens of millions of sharks that are caught annually for their fins, which are \n\none of the most expensive seafood products of the world (Griffin et al., 2008). On the \n\nother hand, sharks are important from an economical point of view for their flesh for \n\nhuman consumption, skin for making complement stuff like handbags, belts and also as \n\nsandpaper to pottery and wood, liver for oil extraction and for medical use, jaws as \n\ntrophies and in aquariums for entertainment (Garc\u00eda, 2008). Another important factor that \n\nmay contribute to the decline of  their populations is the scarceness of prey that may be \n\nthreatened from over fishing and habitat loss due to coastal development and pollution \n\n(Garc\u00eda, 2008). Additionally, all species are exposed to the risk of bioaccumulation of \n\ncontaminants in their bodies because of their high rank position in the trophic chain \n\n(Garc\u00eda, 2008). All these factors cause significant problems for the correct conservation \n\nand management of sharks. \n\nOn the other hand, to understand the biological interactions in animal communities \n\nand the dynamics of marine ecosystems it is essential to know the trophic relationships \n\n(Valls et al., 2011). Unfortunately, there is still little information about the feeding \n\necology of most elasmobranchs; only the species with important commercial value are \n\nstudied. The diets of most top predators are normally quite varied. This allows them to \n\nchange prey species when certain populations are low (Griffin et al., 2008), being an \n\nadvantage since they allow prey species to persist. Moreover Pardo-Gandarillas et al., \n\n(2007) suggested that the size, the movement of prey and the contrast with the medium \n\nare commonly positive relationships between the size of predator fish and their prey. \n\nBesides, visual characteristics that may influence the selection of prey by predators are \n\nimportant in sharks feeding ecology. \n\nAs Fanelli et al. (2009) described, the segregation and competition among species \n\nmay be the result of the combination of several niche aspects, one of which may be \n\npreponderant over the others. It is necessary to determine the food and feeding ecology \n\nof sharks to clarify the relationships between sharks, prey availability and fisheries \n\n(Xavier et al., 2012), thus the study of the stomach contents is necessary to contribute the \n\nanalysis of bio-ecological aspects in ecosystems where the species are integrated. \n\n1.2. Description of studied species  \n\nCompagno et al. (2005) reported that the family Etmopteridae is the largest \n\nsqualoid shark family, with more than 50 species distributed in five genera. The genus \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nEtmopterus is the most diverse genus of this family, containing at least 31 described \n\nspecies. In Portugal, the genus Etmopterus is commonly caught as by-catch and discarded \n\nby several deep-water fisheries that operate in the area (Xavier et al., 2012). \n\n1.2.1. Taxonomic classification  \n\nPhylum CHORDATA  \n\nClass ELASMOBRANCHII  \n\nOrder SQUALIFORMES  \n\nFamily ETMOPTERIDAE Fowler, 1934 \n\nGenus ETMOPTERUS Rafinesque, 1810  \n\n \n\n1.2.2. Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) \n\n \nFigure 1.1: Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) (drawing by @ Laura Nu\u00f1o Mun\u00f5z). \n\n1.2.2.1.General diagnosis \n\nEtmopterus spinax (Fig. 1.1), commonly called Velvet belly, is a small sized deep-\n\nwater squaliform shark, characterized by a fairly stout body, which is brown above and \n\nblack below and has big eyes (Compagno et al., 2005). It has a flattened snout, the upper \n\nteeth are small, with a narrow central cusp and usually less than three pairs of lateral \n\ncusplets. Lower teeth are much larger, strongly slanted, with blade-like cusps at the top \n\nand interlocked bases. On the other hand, the five pairs of gill slits are tiny compared with \n\nthe size to the spiracles. Its main characteristic is the grooved spines that are located on \n\nboth dorsal fins, with the second one much longer than the first one and curved, being \n\nperfectly visible. The anal fin is absent and the caudal fin is long. The Velvet Belly also \n\npossesses numerous photophores which emit a blue-green light visible from away and are \n\ndistributed in a unique pattern for this species, as defined by. It can measure up to a \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nmaximum of 60.0 cm in total length for male or unsexed; its length is normally ~ 45.0 \n\ncm, however females are larger than males Compagno (1984). \n\n1.2.2.2. Biological characteristics  \n\nThe Velvet Belly Lanternshark has an aplacental viviparous reproduction, i.e. the \n\nembryos develop inside the eggs that are retained within the mother\u2019s body until they are \n\nready to hatch. Females usually have litters of 6 or 7 hatchlings. Studies by Coelho and \n\nErizini (2005) revealed that for E. spinax the size at first maturity is significantly higher \n\nfor females (30.86 cm; 75.8% of the maximum observed size) than males, (25.39 cm; \n\n75.1% of the maximum observed size).   \n\nRegarding their mating season, Aranha et al. (2009) reported that during the \n\nmonths of April and July it is possible to occur the breeding season of the females. \n\nHowever, in case of males, a higher percentage of active males was observed during May \n\nand June. The lifespan of E. spinax is estimated at 22 years for females and at 18 years \n\nfor males (Gennari and Scacco, 2007). \n\n1.2.2.3. Distribution and habitat \n\n The Velvet belly is distributed from the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean, \n\nextending from Iceland and Norway to Gabon, including the Mediterranean Sea, \n\nArchipelago of the Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde. The species has also been \n\nreported in the Cape Province in South Africa (Fig. 1.2). This shark species lives mainly \n\nin the outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes, mostly at depths of 200 to \n\n500 meters, near or well above the bottom. However the depth range for the species can \n\nrange from 70 to 2000 meters, FishBase, (Froese and Pauly, 2015). \n\n \nFigure 1.2. Geographical distribution of Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) (source: Global species \n\ndatabase of fish species, FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2015)). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) (drawing by @ Laura Nu\u00f1o Mun\u00f5z) \n \n\n1.2.3.1.General diagnosis \n\nEtmopterus pusillus (Fig. 1.3) also commonly called the Smooth lanternshark, is \n\na small sized deep-water shark, globally widespread (Coelho and Erzini, 2007). It is \n\ncharacterized by a large head with a pointed snout and large oval eyes. This species has \n\nmany rows of teeth on both jaws, where lower teeth are smooth, blade-like and with cusps, \n\non the upper jaw they have cusplets (Compagno, 1984). On the other hand, the skin is \n\ncovered by many widely spaced small blocky denticles not arranged in regular rows, \n\ngiving it a smooth appearance. On its two dorsal fins there are two spines, being the one \n\non the dorsal fin much larger than the one on the first. In addition, there is no anal fin, \n\nand the caudal fin is short and broad. The coloration is uniform dark brown along the \n\ndorsal side, with an obscure broad black mark running above, in front and behind pelvic \n\nfins (Compagno, 1984).  \n\n1.2.3.2. Biological characteristics  \n\nCoelho and Erzini (2005) reported that the Smooth lanternshark is an aplacental \n\nviviparous species which presents preliminary lengths at maturity, but there is no other \n\nbiological information available. Generally the family Etmopteridae is characterized by \n\nhaving a very slow growth rate, late maturities and low reproductive potential (Fowler et \n\nal., 2005). The size at first maturity for E. pusillus is significantly higher for females than \n\nfor males, obtaining in this case, results where the size at first maturity was 43.60 cm \n\n(86.9% of the maximum observed size) for females and 38.10 cm for males (79.5% of the \n\nmaximum observed size) as Coelho et al. (2005) reported. \n\nRegarding their reproductive cycle, Coelho and Erzini (2007) stated that it is \n\ndifficult to establish a definitive reproductive season. Nevertheless, both mature females \n\nwith ripe oocytes and pregnant females were recorded mainly during the winter, from \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nNovember to April. However the active males appeared during the entire year, so it is not \n\npossible to define a reproductive season clearly. \n\n1.2.3.3.Distribution and habitat \n\nThe Smooth lanternshark has a global distribution (Fig. 1.4), and can be found in \n\nthe western Atlantic, in the northern area of the Gulf of Mexico and between southern \n\nBrazil and Argentina, but also in the eastern Atlantic from Portugal to Namibia. It has \n\nalso been reported in the western Indian Ocean, South Africa and in the western Pacific \n\nnear Japan. This species lives mainly on the continental and insular shelves, and upper \n\nslopes at depths from 274 to 1000 meters, but it has also been described in oceanic waters, \n\nbetween Argentina and South Africa, FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2015). \n\n \nFigure 1.4. Geographical distribution of Etmopterus pusillus (Linnaeus, 1758) (source: Global species \n\ndatabase of fish species, FishBase Froese and Pauly, 2015). \n\n1.2.4. Feeding ecology of both species of lantern sharks \n \n\nAccording to several authors, (Neiva et al., 2006, Fanelli et al., 2009 and Xavier et \n\nal., 2012) both species of lantern sharks have similar feeding ecology. This is due to their \n\nmain diet being based on Euphausiids, teleost fish, Natantid decapods and cephalopods, \n\nand many food items found in the stomach of both sharks belonging to the same species. \n\nThe main species of prey found in E. spinax were Meganyctiphanes norvegica \n\n(Euphausiids), Pasiphaea sivado (Natantid decapods), Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis \n\nblennoides and myctophids family (teleosts fish) and some cephalopods like Sepietta \n\noweniana (Neiva et al., 2006) and Histhioteuthis spp. (Fanelli et al., 2009). On the other \n\nhand the main prey species in the diet of E. pusillus were Pasiphaea sivado, \n\nMicromesistius poutassou, Myctiophids, Ommastrephidae and Sepiolidade families \n\n(Xavier et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n1.2.4.1. Main prey items  \n\n- Euphausiids: \n\n- Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars, 1857): \n\nCruzin-Roudy et al. (2004) reported that the populations of this species of \n\nCrustacea, also called Northern krill, are adapted to very different environments and \n\ntrophic conditions along the European coasts and adjacent seas. Krill perform vertical \n\nmigrations from about 100 m in shallow environments reaching more than 500 m in \n\nthe Ligurian Sea. Their reproductive season is long during spring and summer seasons \n\nfor the northern sites and short during the late winter and early spring in the Ligurian \n\nSea. \n\n- Natantid  decapod: \n\n- Pasiphaea sivado (Risso, 1816): \n\nThis Crustacean of the family Pasiphaeidae is distributed along the eastern Atlantic, \n\nBritish Islands and Mediterranean Sea. It is a demersal species and it lives between 10 \n\nand 600 m deep. P. sivado is an ovigerous species and their reproductive cycle happens \n\nduring the early summer (July) and early winter (December) (Falcai et al. 1995).  \n\n- Teleosts fish: \n\n- Micromesistius poutassou (Risso, 1827): \n\nBlue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is a bathypelagic gadoid which is found \n\nalong to the north-east Atlantic, from Spitsbergen (Greenland) in the north to Morocco \n\n(Africa) in the south (Heino et al., 2008). Usually this species is distributed between 300 \n\nto 400 m from the surface but it can be found at depths of over 150-3000 m in midwaters, \n\nFishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2015). The reproduction of this species of gadoid is produced \n\nfrom February in the south to May in the north, at 180-360 m, on the edge of continental \n\nshelf (Marine Species Identification Portal, 2015).  \n\n- Phycis blennoides (Br\u00fcnnich, 1768): \n\nPhycis blennoides is another gadoid species, which is distributed from the eastern \n\nAtlantic to West Africa (Norway and Iceland to Cape Blanc), also the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nIt is possible to found at a depth range of 10 to 800 m, over sand and mud bottoms (Cohen \n\net al., 1990). The spawning period observed in this species in the Mediterranean Sea \n\noccurs from January to March (Svetovidov, 1986; Cohen et al., 1990; Massut\u00ed et al., 1996 \n\nin Rotllant et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n- Family Myctophidae: \n\nAccording to Nelson (2006) the Myctiophids are the most species-rich family of \n\nmesopelagic fishes with 235 species. They are possible to found in all oceans from near \n\nthe surface to deep waters, because they have a diurnal migration of several hundred \n\nmeters. During the daytime the peak abundance of most species is between 300 and 1200 \n\nm depth, while at night they are between 10 and 100 m. Their period of spawning is very \n\nvariable (Marine Species Identification Portal, 2015).  \n\n- Cephalopods: \n\n- Sepietta oweniana (d'Orbigny, 1841): \n\nSepietta oweniana is a cephalopod species, which belongs to the family Sepiolidae. \n\nIt is a benthopelagic species that is found over muddy bottoms on the shelf and the upper \n\nslope, ranging in depth from about 50 to over 600 m. It has a geographical distribution \n\nfrom Northeast Atlantic (Norway), at depths of 50-100 m, to Morroco and the \n\nMediterranean Sea, at 100-400 m. Their entire spawning period extends from March to \n\nNovember (Roper et al., 1984).  \n\n-Family Histioteuthidae Verrill, 1881: \n\nThe species of this family of cephalopods are widespread from Eastern and western \n\ncentral Atlantic and western Mediterranean; southeast Atlantic, south Indian Ocean \n\n(limits undetermined); west of the Galapagos Islands off California, Hawaii and Japan; \n\nSouth Pacific. It is an oceanic species, which is reported to usually exist between depths \n\nof 500 and 1500 m, sometimes associated with the bottom (Roper et al., 1984). According \n\nto Cuccu et al. (2014), these cephalopods have a single breeding period in their life, due \n\nto them being semelparous, but a great flexibility has been observed in their reproductive \n\nstrategies, which range from simultaneous terminal spawning over a short period at the \n\nend of the animal\u2019s life to continuous spawning over a long period of their life.  \n\n- Ommastrephes bartramii d\u2019Orbigny, 1835: \n\nOmmastrephes bartramii has a wide and discontinuous distribution in subtropical \n\nand temperate ocean waters and it is absent from equatorial waters (Boschi, 1998). As \n\nWatanabe et al. (2004) reported, this species are mainly distributed in the 300 to 600 m \n\nlayer during the daytime and migrate to the 0 to 100 m layer at night in transitional waters \n\nof the central North Pacific. The period of spawning for Ommastrephes bartramii is rather \n\nextended (January to May in Japan) (Roper, 1984). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n1.2.5. Economic and conservation values in fisheries \n\nAs explained above, Elasmobranch fishes are generally highly susceptible to \n\nfishing mortality. According to Coelho and Erzini (2008) the genus Etmopterus is caught  \n\nin deep-water fisheries (mainly bottom trawl) that operate in Portuguese waters. In these \n\nfisheries Etmopterus pusillus is caught in large quantities as a by-catch species but, due \n\nto its low or insignificant commercial value, it is more often discarded (Coelho and Erzini, \n\n2008). The Algarve is the sixth area with the highest fish discharge (by biomass) using \n\ncrustacean trawl fishery (Neiva et al., 2006). In the semi-pelagic and near-bottom longline \n\nfishery for hake (Merlucciidae) Etmopterus pusillus is the fourth most abundant species \n\ncaught. However, the catch of this species is not recorded in the fishery statistics of \n\nPortugal making it difficult to obtain any information about its biology, feeding \n\npreferences and ecology (Xavier et al., 2012). This also seems to be the case with catches \n\nof Etmopterus spinax in the coast of southern Portugal.  \n\nThe two studied species are exposed to high levels of fishing mortality, long life \n\ncycles with slow growth rates, late maturity and low fecundities (Coelho et al., 2010). \n\nThe intense fishing activities combined with the biological factors of these species will \n\nprobably contribute for their decline in a very near future, and it could take decades for \n\nthem to recover.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n1.3.  Objectives of this study: \n\nThe main aim of this study was to determine the feeding composition of two \n\nspecies of small deep-water Lanternsharks (Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus pusillus). \n\nSecondary objectives were: \n\n1) Evaluating the diet of each species by sex and maturity stage; \n\n2) Evaluating the influence of seasonality into the diet of each species; \n\n3) Determining the trophic level of each species;  \n\n4) Comparing the diets of the two species of lanternsharks.  \n\nDespite being widespread along the Algarve coast, there is still not much \n\ninformation on the feeding ecology of these two species. Consequently, studying the \n\nfeeding habits of these species is important to reach a better knowledge of their behaviour \n\nand their position in the trophic level.  Studying their biology and gathering information \n\nabout their suitable habitats may be an important step towards the conservation of these \n\nvulnerable species or contribute to reduce their discards and/or increase their economic \n\nvalue. For these reasons, this study has a social, economic and especially biological \n\ninterest. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2                         MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n2.

This region is located in the south of Portugal, \n\nwhere Faro is the administrative centre (37? 01\u2019 N, 7? 56\u2019 W). It has a surface area of \n\n4960 km2, and around 200 km of coast, from Odeceixe in the west to Vila Real do Santo \n\nAnt\u00f3nio close to the Spanish border in the southeast (Monteiro, 1987). The west coast is \n\ncharacterized by a rugged coastline with cliffs, and the south coast is mainly distinguished \n\nby its sandy beaches and limestone caves (Monteiro, 1987). There are also particular \n\ngeological features that generate specific conditions for the sea environment or the current \n\nflow patterns, and consequently for the ecological biodiversity and trophic relations in \n\nthe natural wildlife. The continental shelf has a variable width, from 8 km in Cabo de \n\nSanta Maria to 30 km near the locality of Portim\u00e3o, whereas the depth is limited from \n\nabout 110 to 150 meters (Magalh\u00e3es, 2001).  \n\nAs for the geological features, the current flow is normally weak and the main \n\ndrift current follows the coastline at a bathymetry about 30 meters (Magalh\u00e3es, 2001). In \n\naddition, the Algarve coast is also under the influence of the Mediterranean Sea because \n\nits water, denser and warmer, flows through the Gibraltar Strait into the Atlantic Ocean \n\nand affects it at a hydrological and biological level (Monteiro, 1987). Thereby, the sea \n\nsurface temperature oscillates between 17? C in winter and 21? C in summer, occurring a \n\nstratification during this period. Furthermore, the temperature at a depth about 50 m is \n\nestablished at around 15? C during the whole year (Sanchez and Relvas, 2003).  \n\n2.2. Characterization of sample \n\n The biological material used to develop the present study was collected from \n\naccidental catches, called bycatch, and discards of crustaceans and fish deep-water \n\ncommercial trawlers throughout the south coast of Algarve (Portugal). These captures \n\nwere carried out during two scientific projects concerning bycatch and discards \n\n(BYDISCARD, CE DGXIV-99/058; DISCALG, CE DGXIV-97/0087) (Costa et al., \n\n2002), which began in February 1999 and ended in September 2000. Fish samples also \n\ncome from a campaign for evaluating bycatch of the crustacean trawl fishery in the \n\nAlgarve, which lasted for five days, this began on the 27th of April 2015 and ended on the \n\n3rd of May 2015. In the Algarve coast bycatch can exceed the catch of target species with \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nthis type of fishing gear (Campos and Fonseca, 2004), similar to what happens in many \n\ncrustacean trawl fisheries worldwide.  \n\nDuring the two scientific projects concerning bycatch and discards, previously \n\nspecified, 173 Etmopterus spinax specimens were randomly collected (out of 629) from \n\n297 m to 754 m deep (Annex 4). On the other hand, during the sampling/campaign of \n\n2015, 58 individuals of Etmopterus pusillus were collected. In this last case, the trawl was \n\nworking at depths ranging from 160 m to 490 m off the coast of Olh\u00e3o (Algarve, Portugal) \n\n(Annex 5). More lately, the individuals were stored in the freezer so they would not \n\ndeteriorate for further analysis in the laboratory. \n\nLength, sex, maturity and season data were taken from the above mentioned project\u2019s \n\ndatabase. Individuals from the second campaign were measured (Total length, cm and \n\nweight, g) and sexed at the laboratory. The total length (cm) was used for each specimen \n\nof each species in order to obtain the state of maturity for each shark species (Tab. 2.1). \n\nThe broad maturity stage (juvenil vs adult) of each individual was determined by \n\nconfronting each individual length with the length at first maturity according to data \n\nreported by Coelho and Erzini (2005) for both species of lantern sharks. In the case of E. \n\nspinax, the length at 50% maturity was 30.86 cm for females and 25.39 cm for males, \n\nwhile the length at 50% maturity for E. pusillus was higher than for E. spinax, obtaining \n\na length of 43.60 cm for females and 38.10 cm for males.  \n\nTable 2.1: Characterization of the samples of each species, E. spinax (above) and E. pusillus (below) in \n\nrespect to the total length (cm) and total weight (g), where it was calculated; n (number of specimens), % \n\n(percentage number), Min.

This fact was due to the \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nsamples shortage of some seasons. Then, the specimens obtained during the warm months \n\nwere grouped into the hot season category (spring and summer), and the specimens \n\ncaught during the cold months were grouped into the cold season category (winter and \n\nautumn).  \n\n2.3.Laboratory procedure \n\nThe stomach samples of E. spinax, were kept in formalin for a time. Therefore the \n\nstomachs were removed from formalin plastic containers where they were individually \n\npreserved in 4% buffered formalin and subsequently immersed in 70% ethanol in marked \n\ncontainers for further analysis (Costa et al., 2002). The use of 4% formalin allows the \n\nfixation of tissues and also minimizes the digestion process when the individual is caught \n\n(Bowen, 1983 in Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). Once the remaining contents of formalin disappeared, \n\neach stomach was weighed, considering the result as wet weight. Subsequently the sample \n\nwas opened and the content was placed on a Petri plate using small ethanol jets, then the \n\nremaining liquid was removed with an absorbent paper (Fig. 2.1). On the other hand the \n\nstomach wall was weighed (wet weight) to have a more accurate value of the weight of \n\nthe contents in the stomach. Later, the individuals ingested were identified using a lens \n\nand sorted into different categories (cephalopods, crustaceans and fish). Furthermore, the \n\ncategory of not identified preys was assigned in the case of prey items really affected by \n\nthe digestion process (Fig. 2.2). After this procedure, individuals of each taxon were \n\nweighed (total weight) separately using scales (\u00b1 0.01 g). Once the stomach contents of \n\nall individuals were weighed, they were transferred to small plastic containers with \n\nethanol 70% for further taxonomic analysis. \n\n    \n\nFigure 2.1: Laboratory procedure carried out for the stomach contents analysis of E. spinax and E. pusillus \n\n(photos by @ Laura Nu\u00f1o Mu\u00f1oz). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nFor the identification procedure different taxonomic keys were used depending on \n\nthe phyllum of each organism found (Zariquiey, 1968; Roper et al., 1984; Falciai and \n\nMinervini, 2005). On the other hand, it is also important to know that all preys were \n\ndigested and the identification process was complicated. In the cases in which the \n\nstomachs were full of sediment and/or unidentified bulk, the data was not taken into \n\naccount for further analysis. A digestion key was used to identify the digested rank \n\naccording to the decomposition state of the preys (Aloncle and Delaporte, 1970). This \n\nkey describes the degradation state for fishes, crustaceans, bivalves and polychaetes. The \n\nrank ranges from 1 to 4 for fish, crustaceans and polychaetes and from 1 to 3 for bivalves, \n\nbeing 1 the state in which the preys have been digested recently and therefore they have \n\na firm consistency, in the 2 state the prey begin to decompose, and finally 3 and/or 4 the \n\nstate in which only the hard parts of individuals will be preserved. In order to avoid \n\ndigestion biases, prey items were identified mainly based on fresh hard parts, such as fish \n\notoliths, cephalopod beaks, crustacean carapaces or appendices, reaching the lowest \n\ntaxonomic level possible. So as for our case, the fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks were \n\ntreated in order to reach each ingested prey\u2019s type. \n\nFigure 2.2: Prey items (cephalopods, crustaceans and fish) found in the stomach contents of E. spinax and \n\nE. pusillus in different digestion stages (photos by @ Laura Nu\u00f1o Mu\u00f1oz). \n\nThe otoliths were identified observing their morphologic descriptions according \n\nto otolith shapes, outline and groove features using different taxonomic keys such as \n\nTuset et al. (2008) and Ramos (1999). \n\nThe cephalopods beaks were identified according to different measures on the \n\nupper and lower beak, where both beak measures were used as independent variables in \n\na linear regression model with mantle length and body weight (log transformed) of \n\ndifferent cephalopod species (Wolff, 1984) (Fig. 2.3).  \n\nIn our case only the beak measures reported by Wolff (1984) were taken for the \n\nidentification of each cephalopod species by lens. The upper beak measures were: Length \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nof the rostrum (RL), rostral tip to inner margin of wing (RW), length of hood (HL), width \n\nof the wing (WW), wing to crest length (WCL), jaw angle width (JW), and length of the \n\ncrest (CL). Similarly the lower beak measures were: Rostral tip to inner posterior corner \n\nof the lateral wall (RC), rostral tip to inner margin of wing (RW), length of the rostrum \n\n(RL), length of the wing (WL) and jaw angle width (JW). \n\n \nFigure 2.3: Side and top view of upper part and lower part of cephalopod beak with their different measures \n\n(Wolff, 1984). \n\nFinally, the data obtained was stored in a data base to proceed to perform \n\ncalculations with different statistical analysis types. \n\n2.4. Representativeness of the sample \n\nCalculating the trophic diversity by Shannon index or calculation of the \n\ncumulative number of dietary items are the main methods used to determine the number \n\nof predators which are necessary to describe their diet, for this purpose the number of \n\nindividuals analysed must be random (Hurtubia, 1973; Cailliet, 1977 in Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). \n\nTo consider a sample representative, it needs to reach a point in which the curve defined \n\nby each method, begins to stabilize. This point of stabilization is the point at which the \n\nprobability of not considering an important item in the diet is quite low (Gon\u00e7alves, \n\n2000). \n\nIn this study, the cumulative number of prey species found in the stomachs \n\nanalysed for both species of sharks , which contained some prey type, was used, \n\nconsidering all individuals identified to the lowest taxonomic level. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n2.5. Univariate statistical analyses \n\n2.5.1. Quantitative analyses \n\nDiet quantity data was analysed by Relative Measures of Prey Quantities \n\n(RMPQs) using the following indices: percentage of occurrence by number (%N), \n\npercentage of frequency of occurrence (%F), and percentage of occurrence by weight \n\n(%W) of prey items (Preti et al., 2008).  \n\n2.5.1.1. Numeric method: \n\nThe value %N is the number of individuals of a specific taxon (n) found in all \n\nstomachs divided by the total number of all prey found into the stomach which contained \n\nprey (N) and multiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). \n\n%? =\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7 100 \n\nNormally the digestion process causes the fractionation of prey species, so it was \n\nnecessary to establish some criteria for accounting for prey individuals for further \n\nanalyses (Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). In the case of the prey that were most affected by the \n\ndigestion process and which were identified by their distinctive parts. However some prey \n\nspecies could not be quantified, thus it was considered an amount of 1 individual (e.g., a \n\ngroup of similar fish scales). However, in the case of the prey that were least affected by \n\nthe digestion process their quantification could be performed. \n\n2.5.1.2. Gravimetric method: \n\n The gravimetric method or percentage by weight (%W) is obtained as the total \n\nweight of all remains of a specific taxon (w) divided by the total weight of all prey remains \n\nfound (W) multiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). \n\n%? =\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7 100 \n\n2.5.1.3. Frequency of occurrence: \n\nThis quantitative index (%F) is represented as the number of stomachs containing \n\nprey of a specific taxon (f) divided by the total number of stomachs containing prey \n\nmultiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). \n\n%?? =\n?\n\n????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????\n\u00d7 100 \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nIt is possible that the sum of the frequency of occurrence values could exceeded \n\n100%, because more than one different item can be found in the same stomach \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). Different categories of prey can be distinguished according to the \n\nresults obtained for %F (Cardoza Mart\u00ednez et al., 2011), which indicates the possible \n\nfeeding preferences of an organism: accidental prey (%F &lt;10%), secondary prey (10% \n\n&lt;%F &lt;50%) and preferential prey (%F > 50%). \n\nIn addition, to normalize the different indices and thereby compare them more \n\neasily (inter- and intraspecific comparisons), Rosecchi and Nouaze (1987) proposed \n\naltering its formula to transform the values of FO to percentage as occurs with %N and \n\n%W values, obtaining the corrected occurrence frequency (FOc) by modifying all indices \n\nin which it operates: \n\n??? = 100 \u00d7\n%??\n\n? %??\n \n\nRegarding the calculation of this quantitative analyses it is important to highlight \n\nthat the empty stomachs and stomachs with sediment content were not considered in the \n\ncalculation of the different indices of this study. \n\n2.5.2. Mixed analyses \n\nIn order to evaluate the main preys in the diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus, different \n\nmixed analysis were calculated, taking into account the quantitative methods (%N, %W \n\nand %F) aforementioned. The mixed indices analysed were: Index of Relative Importance \n\n(IRI) and a Weighted Food Index (IPO2) (Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). \n\n2.5.2.1. Index of Relative Importance (IRI) \n\nThe Index of Relative Importance (IRI) is the result of the interaction of %N, %F \n\nand %V (Volumetric percentage), which was developed to assist in evaluating the \n\nrelationship between the various food items found in stomachs (Pinkas et al., 1971). In \n\nour study the %V parameter was amended by %W parameter as Capitoli et al. (1995) \n\npreviously reported. This index can be calculated by adding the percentage of occurrence \n\nby number and percentage of occurrence by weight values and multiplying by the \n\npercentage of frequency of occurrence value, obtaining the following equation: \n\nIRI = (%N + %W) \u00d7 %FO \n\n  In order to facilitate the inter- and intraspecific comparisons among studies  (Preti \n\net al., 2008), the IRI value was converted into the percentage to keep the same scale as \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nother indices. Index values are sorted into decreasing order according to their %IRI \n\ncontribution (Carrass\u00f3n et al., 1992) for further calculation of cumulative %IRI.  \n\n \n\n2.5.2.2. Weighted Food Index (IPO2): \n\nThe Weighted Food Index IPO2, assigned high weight values according to their \n\nnutritional importance (Mattson, 1981; Bowen, 1983 in Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). The weighted \n\nvalue \u201cx\u201d, which corresponds to a value of 0.25, the sum of %N and %FO. Moreover it \n\nis also attributed the value \u201cy\u201d to %W, which corresponds to 0.5, causing the value of the \n\nweight component to have a higher importance, due to the addition of these three \n\nparameters (Gon\u00e7alves, 2000): \n\na) IPO2 = (%N + %FO) x \u201cx\u201d + %W x \u201cy\u201d  (x = 0.25 and y = 0.5) \n\n2.5.3. General classification methods prey \n\nThe prey were classified into different categories according to classification \n\nmethods of Rosecchi and Nouaze (1987), in which all indices, obtained in percentage, \n\nwere arranged in descending order. This was followed by the sum of the values of the \n\nfirst category with the second category and so on, reaching 50% of the value of the total \n\nindex (preferential prey). Then the addition of the index values for the same cumulative \n\norder to reach 75% of the total index, corresponds to secondary prey, considering the \n\nremaining prey with values reaching 100%, as accessory prey. \n\nThis general classification method allows a comparison between the diets \n\ncalculated through the different indices, and also indicates the existing food selectivity by \n\nthe number of preferential prey groups (Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). \n\n  The IRI, MFI, and IPO2 indices were calculated to obtain the principal, secondary \n\nand accessory prey items (Annex 4-19) according to Gon\u00e7alves, (2000) (Annex 4).  \n\n2.5.4. Vacuity Index (VI)  \n\n The Vacuity Index (VI) was used to determinate the filling state of stomachs \n\n(Cardoza Mart\u00ednez et al., 2011), so that it could be indicators of the feeding activity of \n\nfishes. Thus, to evaluate the percentage of empty stomachs the Vacuity Index (VI) was \n\nused, considering VI as the number of empty stomachs divided by the total number of \n\nexamined stomachs multiplied by 100. This index provides information about the \n\nphysical conditions and the feeding activity periods of individuals (fasting or end of \n\ndigestive process) (Sim\u00f5es de S\u00e1, 2008). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.5.5. Comparing the diets between species \n\n2.5.5.1. Feeding overlap (Schoener Index) \n\nThe Schoener Index was used to evaluate dietary affinities between the different \n\nsexes, size classes, and seasons, in terms of absolute prey abundance (Cartes and Sard\u00e0, \n\n1989). According to Brul\u00e9 and Canch\u00e9 (1993), the feeding overlap index can be calculated \n\nby the following equation: \n\n? = 1 ? 0.5 (?|??? ? ??? |\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n) \n\nAs Morte et al., (2002) determined, n is the number of food organisms, pxi and pyi \n\nare the numerical composition indices of prey (i) in the diets of species x and y, \n\nrespectively. This index has a minimum value of 0 when the overlap feeding is non-\n\nexistent, and a maximum value of 1 when all prey have the same proportion inside the \n\nstomachs. There are three categories established according to the results of Schoener \n\nindex values: i) low level (0 - 0.29), ii) mean level (0.30 \u2013 0.60), and iii) high level (> \n\n0.60), which indicates a trophic overlap (Sim\u00f5es de S\u00e1, 2008). However, if the overlap \n\nindex value is below 0.6 it is normally because diets of different species are significantly \n\ndifferent (Cartes and Sard\u00e0, 1989). \n\n2.5.5.2. Trophic level: \n\nIn order to determine the position in the trophic chain of deep-water shark species \n\nthe trophic levels (TL) based on diets of E. spinax and E. pusillus were estimated. For the \n\nTL calculation for each shark species was taken into account the average trophic level \n\nvalue for each prey category (TLk) according to Cort\u00e9s (1999) methodology using \n\nstandardized IRI: \n\nTLk = 1 + (? Pj\nj=1\n\n\u00d7  TLj) \n\nWhere j is the number of prey categories, Pj is the proportion of the IRI index of \n\nthe prey \u201cj\u201d and TLj is the trophic level of each prey category \u201cj\u201d. \n\n2.5.5.3. Diversity, Richness and Evenness Indices \n\nThe diversity indices are composed by two different components, the total number \n\nof species and the evenness; in other words, how the abundance data is distributed among \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nthe species. Although they are easy to use, there are many problems due to certain \n\nlimitations (Ludwing and Reynolds, 1988). The reason is the confusion between these \n\ntwo variables when trying to combine them. Moreover, the species richness is the oldest \n\nand the simplest concept, since it is the number of species in the community (Krebs, \n\n1999). It is also easy to use but, in the same as diverse indices, this index has a problem \n\nin the measurement, owing to it is often impossible to enumerate all of species in a natural \n\ncommunity.  \n\nHence, in order to evaluate the diversity, richness and evenness of species in the \n\ndiet of E. spinax and E. pusillus species, Shannon (H\u2019), Margalef (R1) and Pielou (J\u2019) \n\nindices were applied (Haidari et al., 2012) using PRIMER-E (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). \n\nIn this study, the identified prey items were used to the calculation of each of these indices \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). In addition to the comparison between sexes, maturity stages and \n\nseasons variables of each deep-water shark species an analysis based on these three \n\ndiversity indices was also carried out. With the purpose to know the existence or absence \n\nof significant differences in the diet diversity by sexes, maturity stage and season for both \n\ndeep-water shark species, the diversity values were tested by a non-parametric Mann-\n\nWhitney Rank Sum Test.  \n\na)  Diversity Index (H\u2019) \n\nThe Shannon Index (H\u2019) is the most common index used to quantify the specific \n\nbiodiversity (Pla, 2006). This index shows the heterogeneity of a community by the \n\nfollowing factors: number of species found and their relative abundance. Shannon Index \n\n(H\u2019) is defined as: \n\n?? =  ?  (? ??  \n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n???2 ?? ) \n\nWhere H\u2019 is the diversity in the stomach; n corresponds to the total number of \n\nspecies in the sample, and pi is the proportion of the species (i) in the stomach. \n\nConceptually it is a measurement of the uncertainty level associated with the \n\nrandom selection of an individual in the community (Pla, 2006); i.e. if a community of \n\nspecies is highly heterogeneous, it is due to the existence of a clearly dominant species \n\nand the remaining species are scarcely present. The uncertainty level will be lower if all \n\nspecies are equally abundant. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nb) Richness Index (R1) \n\n To estimate the species richness in sampling units, the Margalef Index will be used \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves, 2000), which considers the numeric distribution of individuals for different \n\nspecies depending on the individual number existing in the analyzed sample. However, it \n\ndoes not consider the relative importance of species, because it is only based on the \n\nnumber of species found. The Margalef Index is calculated using the following equation \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves, 2000): \n\n?1 =  \n? ? 1\n\nln(?)\n \n\nWhere S is the number of species and N is the total number of individuals. If the \n\nresults of the richness index are near to 0, there is lower species richness and consequently \n\nthe diversity in sampling units is also low. However, if its values are near to 1, the species \n\nrichness is higher and thus the diversity of sampling units is high. \n\nc) Evenness index (J\u2019) \n\nAccording to Magurran (1988), in order to know how the abundance data is \n\ndistributed among the species, the Pielou\u2019s evenness index was used. This index is based \n\nin the relationship between the observed diversity, such as Shannon\u2019s diversity index \n\n(H\u2019), and the maximum diversity (Hmax). The maximum diversity could occur when all \n\nspecies have the same abundance, in other words if H\u2019= Hmax = ln S. Hence, the ratio of \n\nobserved diversity to maximum diversity can be taken as a measure of evenness (E): \n\n? =\nH?\n\nHmax\n=\n\nH?\n\nln S\n \n\nThe E value is within the range between 0 and 1, where the value of 1 represents \n\na situation in which all species are equally abundant (Magurran, 1988).  \n\n2.6. Multivariate statistical analyses \n\nThe software PRIMER V6.0 (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological \n\nResearch) was used for multivariate statistical analyses (Clarke and Gorley, 2006). These \n\nanalyses were used to compare two or more samples which share particular species at a \n\ncomparable level of abundance (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). In this case, this method \n\nwas used to obtain information about the diet composition of E. spinax and E. pusillus, to \n\ncompare their diets and to test the overall differences in general prey types. Comparisons \n\nwere done through different tests such as CLUSTER, MDS and SIMPER and a statistical \n\npermutational test ANOSIM. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe starting point for many of the analyses is normally linked to the concept of \n\nsimilarity between samples, in terms of biological communities. There are many ways to \n\ndefine similarity, usually depending on the weight it has on different aspects of the \n\ncommunity. In order to increase the abundance of minority species and adjust the \n\nsimilarity level of the communities, it is necessary to replace the original data matrix \n\n(species / samples) for a transformed data matrix. Therefore, in the present study, the \n\nstatistical analyses of the samples will be performed with a fourth root of the original data \n\nmatrix (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). The data matrix was formed by the most \n\nrepresentative index, i.e. relative importance index corrected (IRIc). \n\n2.6.1. CLUSTER analysis \n\nIn order to determine similarities and differences in the diet of E. spinax and E. \n\npusillus, a matrix of similarities (calculated from original data matrix) between each pair \n\nof individuals was calculated using the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. This coefficient \n\nis necessary for the Cluster analysis and it was calculated with data transformed to fourth \n\nroot. The aim of Cluster analysis is to find \u201cnatural groupings\u201d of those samples that are \n\nmore similar to each other within a group, than other samples in different groups. Samples \n\nare \u201cmapped\u201d in such a way that distances between pairs of samples show the relative \n\ndissimilarity of the species composition in the diet (Clarke and Warwick, 2001) \n\n2.6.2. Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS) \n\nThe Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS) is a spatial representation \n\ntechnique which reflects the particular aspects of community structure (Clarke, 1993). \n\nThe values were represented graphically on a map in order to analyse the similarity or \n\ndissimilarity in the diet of these two species according to the distance between each \n\nrepresented point on the multidimensional space. Thus, if the distance between two points \n\nis large, the diet composition will have a low similarity and if this distance is smaller, the \n\nsimilarity in the diet composition will be (Clarke and Warwick, 2001) \n\n2.6.3. ANOSIM analysis \n\nANOSIM test is an analysis used to evaluate statistical differences in the diet \n\ncomposition between the elasmobranchs groups of E. spinax and E. pusillus and within \n\neach species in relation to sex, maturity state and season. This multivariate analysis \n\n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013) performs a null hypothesis of similarity of the parameters that \n\ndescribe the behaviour of the variables in the different species according to their type of \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\ndiet. The value of ANOSIM-R indicates the extent of the difference between groups (R > \n\n0.75: well separated groups; R = 0.50-0.75: separated but overlapping groups; R = 0.25-\n\n0.50: separated but strongly overlapping groups; and R &lt;0.25: barely separated groups) \n\n(Pethybridge et al., 2011).  \n\n2.6.4. SIMPER analysis \n\nThe Similarity Percentage analysis (SIMPER) procedure was used in order to \n\ncalculate the value of similarity (Krebs, 1999) according to the main species of both \n\nelasmobranch diets depending on different parameters (sex, maturity state and season) \n\n(Fanelli et al., 2009). Each community sample must be standardized in terms of \n\npercentages, so the relative abundances reach 100% in each sample. So it is possible to \n\nknow what prey is typical of the diet depending on the degree of similarity in the \n\ndendrogram, and thus it is possible to identify the main prey taxon. (Krebs, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3                                                            RESULTS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n3.

Representativeness of the sample \n\nThe representativeness of the sample was obtained from the relationship between \n\nthe cumulative number of prey species and cumulative number of stomachs with content \n\nof E. spinax (n=97). The cumulative prey curves described an increasing relationship \n\nwhich reached asymptotic stabilization with approximately 59 stomachs analyzed and 22 \n\nspecies of prey, where the sample starts to be representative.

General composition of the diet \n\nIn the feeding study of E. spinax 173 stomachs were considered, of which 76 \n\nstomachs were empty, resulting in a vacuity index of 43.9%, regarding the total number \n\nof stomachs. The average number of prey per stomach was 1.6 with an average weight of \n\n1.16 g. The percentages for stomachs filled with unidentified bulk and with sediments \n\n(sand and mud) regarding the total number of stomachs, were obtained: 19.1% and ~11%, \n\nrespectively, resulting in 97 stomachs with contents for further analysis.  \n\nIn the stomach contents of E. spinax, 19 different prey species were identified. \n\nThey belong to three groups of prey - cephalopods, crustaceans and fish - in which \n\ndifferent prey items were identified (9, 5 and 5, respectively) (Tab. 3.1). The rest of prey \n\nitems were considered as unidentified items. The systematic classification of all prey \n\nitems are represented in the Annexes 1, 2 and 3.  \n\nThe quantitative indices (%N, %W, %FO and %IRI) of the three main groups of \n\nprey were taken into account to represent the diet of E. spinax. The crustaceans were the \n\nmost representative group in terms of IRI (70.3%), %N (70%) and %FO (54.4%).

Natantia which is the 1st in the ranking \n\norder is the preferential prey, N.i. Fish in the 2nd rank is the secondary prey and the rest \n\nof prey are accessory prey (Tab. 3.3) (Annex 30).  \n\nTable 3.3: Classification of prey by IRI values according to Rosecchi and Nouaze (1987) for E. spinax. \n\nPrey items %IRI values \nCumulative \n\n%IRI values \n\nRosecchi and Nouaze (1987) \n\nclassification \n\nSbO.

According to this classification it was possible to verify \n\nthat from 2 preferential prey, the SbO. Natantia (27.5%) and N.i. Fish (27.37%). \n\nRegarding secondary prey, N.i. Ceph (8.52%) and N.i. Crust (6.73%) were the most \n\nrelevant secondary prey. Sepia orbignyana (3.33%) was the most representative of the \n\nother prey items (Tab. 3.4) (Annex 31).  \n\nTable 3.4: Classification of prey by IPO2 values for E. spinax. \n\nGroup of prey IPO2 values (%) Cumulative IPO2 values (%) Classification of prey \n\nSbO.

Diversity indices \n\nConcerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition of E. \n\nspinax was possible to observe that this species present similar and very low values of \n\neach index, some of them near 0 and other being 0. Therefore resulting values of 0.3 \u00b1 \n\n0.47; 0.5 \u00b1 0.72 and 0.4 \u00b1 0.45 for diversity, richness and evenness indices, respectively.  \n\n3.1.3. Relationship between sex and diet composition \n\nIn the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of E. spinax species only \n\nthe index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. The IRI index \n\nwas used because it combines all quantitative indices (N, FO, and W) that while giving \n\nmore importance to the frequency of occurrence, it also discriminates better between \n\nvalues of the index allowing an effective evaluation of the importance of each type of \n\nprey to predator diet. \n\nThe vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and \n\nsediment obtained for the sex variable of this species was calculated, taking into account \n\nthe total number of stomachs of each sex. These results are shown in the following table \n\n(Tab. 3.5). \n\nTable 3.5: Vacuity Index (VI) and percentages of unidentified bulk (N.i.

Considering the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 7), it is possible to verify \n\nthat crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in the diet of the \n\nVelvet belly females, representing 74.6% in terms of IRI. Decapods were the crustacean \n\nprey items which contributed most to IRI (72.6%) (Fig. 3.7) (Annex 19). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative \n\nimportance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of E. spinax male specimens (N=51). \n\n \n\nMales \n\nFor the relationship between sex and diet for the male specimens of E. spinax and \n\nconsidering the empty stomachs, 46 stomachs were analyzed. According to the \n\nquantitative analysis (Annex 8), crustaceans were the main component in the diet of \n\nVelvet belly male specimens and in terms of IRI (62.7%), as in the case of females, the \n\ndecapods was the prey items which contributed most to IRI (56.5%) (Fig. 3.8) (Annex \n\n20). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative \n\nimportance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of E. spinax male specimens (N=46). \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nCephalopods Crustaceans Fish\n\n(%)\n\nGroup of prey\n\nMales \n\nE. spinax\n\nIRIc\n\n%N\n\n%W\n\n%FOc\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nCephalopods Crustaceans Fish\n\n(%)\n\nGroup of prey\n\nFemale\n\nE. spinax\n\nIRIc\n\n%N\n\n%W\n\n%FOc\n\nDecapoda\n\n72.6%\n\nN.i.

Diversity indices \n\nConcerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition \n\nbetween sexes for E. spinax species, was possible to observe that both females and males \n\npresent similar and low values of each index. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.6 \u00b1 \n\n0.75 for female and 0.6 \u00b1 0.72 for male specimens. In addition, the values obtained of \n\nspecies richness for females and males were 0.6 \u00b1 0.75 and 0.6 \u00b1 0.72, respectively. \n\nFinally, in case of species evenness, the values obtained were 0.4 \u00b1 0.46 for females and \n\n0.4 \u00b1 0.48 for males. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a \n\nstatistically significant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed \n\np-values:  p = 0.624, p = 0.820 and p = 0.853. \n\n3.1.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis: \n\nThe classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items \n\nfound in the diet of both sexes (female and male) of E. spinax specimens indicated that, \n\nat the 17% similarity level, the 97 specimens\u2019 combination (only specimens with prey \n\nitems into the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters were \n\nisolated. The main six groups of clusters were composed of different combinations \n\nbetween both sexes of E. spinax specimens. The last two groups (isolated clusters) \n\nconsisted in two mature males captured in summer (Fig. 3.9). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the \n\ndiet for both sexes of E. spinax specimens. The eight groups defined at similarity level of 17% are indicated \n\nby the dashed line. (   : A, B and C). \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe result of MDS analysis also corresponds to the main five groups of \n\nCLUSTERS analysis. For this analysis it is important to note that the isolated clusters \n\nwere not taken into account, because in these specimens were only found one prey item \n\nwith very low weight. Hence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with \n\nhigh percentage of similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.07, which \n\nindicates a good representation of the ordination in a plane (2D) (Fig. 3.10). \n\nIn addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not significant \n\ndifferences in the diet composition of both sexes of E. spinax specimens (ANOSIM test, \n\nR= -0.005, p > 0.05).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10: MDS plot of relative importance in the diet for both sexes of E. spinax specimens.

In terms of relative \n\nimportance, SbO. Natantia and N.i. Fish were the prey items most responsible for the \n\nsimilarity in the diet between both sexes of E. spinax. For female specimens the \n\ncontribution percentages of SbO. Natantia and N.i. Fish were 67.04% and 25.92%, \n\nrespectively, and for male specimens were 81.40% and 11.85%, respectively (Tab. 3.6). \n\nTable 3.6: SIMPER results for the relative importance of prey items between female (F) and male (M) \n\nspecimens of E. spinax.

Relationship between maturity and diet: \n\nIn the analysis of the relationship between maturity stages and diet of each deep-\n\nwater shark species only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in \n\nthis study. The IRI index was used due to its adequate combination of quantitative indices \n\n(N, FO and W) and better discrimination power. \n\nThe vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and \n\nsediment obtained for the maturity variable of this species was calculated, taking into \n\naccount the total number of stomachs of each maturity for each sex are shown in the \n\nfollowing table (Tab. 3.7). \n\nTable 3.7: Vacuity Index (VI) and percentages of unidentified bulk (N.i.

Diversity indices \n\nRegarding the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition \n\nbetween maturity stages for E. spinax species, was possible to observe that both immature \n\nand mature specimens present similar and very low values of each index. Thus resulting \n\ndiversity values of 0.3 \u00b1 0.46 for immature and 0.4 \u00b1 0.47 for mature specimens. In the \n\nsame way happened with the values of richness of species, obtaining of 0.4 \u00b1 0.68 for \n\nimmature and 0.6 \u00b1 0.75 for mature specimens. Finally, in case of species evenness, the \n\nvalues obtained were 0.3 \u00b1 0.43 for immature and 0.5 \u00b1 0.47 for mature specimens. The \n\nMann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a statistically significant \n\ndifferences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed p-values  p = 0.131, p = \n\n0.107 and p = 0.055. \n\n3.1.4.2. Multivariate statistical analysis \n\nThe classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items \n\nfound in the diet of immature and mature specimens of E. spinax indicated that, at the \n\n17% similarity level, the 97 specimens\u2019 combination (only specimens with prey items \n\ninto the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters were isolated. \n\nThe main six groups of clusters were composed of different combinations between both \n\nmaturity stages of E. spinax specimens. The two isolated clusters consisted in two mature \n\nmales captured in summer (Fig. 3.15). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the \n\ndiet for both maturity stages of E. spinax specimens.

In addition it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into \n\naccount, because in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. \n\nHence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of \n\nsimilarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.07, which indicates a good \n\nrepresentation of the ordination in a 2-dimensional graphic (Fig. 3.16). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15: MDS plot of relative importance in the diet for both maturity stages of E. spinax specimens. \n\nThe main five groups defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the \n\ndashed line. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not  differences \n\nbetween the diet composition of immature and mature specimens of E. spinax, although \n\nthe p value is less than 0.05 (ANOSIM test, R=0.05, p<0.05). This fact mean that there is \n\na great variability in the diet composition between both maturity stages of E. spinax. \n\n Regarding SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average contribution \n\nof the prey items to the dissimilarity in the diet between both maturity stages of E. spinax \n\nspecimens was 66.74%. In terms of relative importance SbO. Natantia (29.26%), N.i. Fish \n\n(24.38%) and N.i. Cephalopods (N.i. Ceph) (12.73%) were the prey items most \n\nresponsible for the dissimilarity in the diet between immature and mature specimens of \n\nE. spinax. In addition the differences in the IRI average of the most contributors prey \n\nitems in the diet are very consistent between both immature and mature specimens (Tab. \n\n3.8). \n\nTable 3.8: SIMPER results for the relative importance of prey items between immature (Imat) and mature \n\n(Mat) specimens of E. spinax.

Relationship between season and diet \n\nIn the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of each deep-water shark \n\nspecies only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. \n\nThe IRI index was used due to its apropriate combination of quantitative indices (N, FO \n\nand W) and better discrimination capacity. \n\nThe vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and \n\nsediment obtained in the stomachs of this species according to the season variable was \n\ncalculated, taking into account the total number of stomachs of each season category (hot \n\nseason and cold season).

Concerning the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 13), it is \n\npossible to verify that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in \n\nthe diet of the E. pusillus during hot season. Furthermore, the decapods were the \n\ncrustacean prey items most contributors, with IRI value of 66.5% (Fig. 3.16) (Annex 25). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative \n\nimportance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of E. spinax specimens in hot season (N=65). \n\nCold season \n\nFor the analysis of the relationship between seasons and diet for the specimens of \n\nE. spinax in cold seasons (winter and autumn) and taking account the empty stomachs, \n\n32 stomachs were analyzed. Regarding the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 14), it is \n\npossible to verify that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in \n\nthe diet of the E. spinax during cold season, also the contribution to IRI index of \n\nSepiolidae prey item was very low (0.09%).

Diversity indices \n\nRegarding the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition \n\nbetween two different season categories (hot and cold seasons) for E. spinax species, was \n\npossible to observe that the values of both season categories presented, for each index, \n\nalmost the same values and also very low. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.3 \u00b1 0.48 \n\nfor hot season and 0.3 \u00b1 0.43 for cold season. Furthermore, the values obtained of species \n\nrichness for hot season were 0.5 \u00b1 0.74, whereas for cold season were 0.5 \u00b1 0.66. Finally, \n\nin case of species evenness, the values obtained were 0.4 \u00b1 0.46 and 0.4 \u00b1 0.45 for hot \n\nand cold season, respectively. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were \n\nnot a statistically significant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the \n\nfollowed p-values  p = 0.062, p = 0.107 and p = 0.952. \n\n3.1.5.2. Multivariate statistical analysis \n\nThe classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items \n\nfound in the specimens diet of E. spinax in spring, summer, winter and autumn indicated \n\nthat, at the 17% similarity level, the 97 specimens\u2019 combination (only specimens with \n\nprey items into the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters \n\nwere isolated. These clusters consisted in two mature males captured in summer (Fig. \n\n3.18).  \n\nThe result of MDS analysis corresponds to the first five groups of CLUSTERS \n\nanalysis. Furthermore it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into \n\naccount, because in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. \n\nHence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of \n\nsimilarity.

Ceph (5.5%) (Fig. 3.23) (Annex 15). \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.23: Relative importance by weight (%W) of the main groups of prey (left) and of the different \n\norders of prey (right) in the diet of E. pusillus (N=32). \n\nIn terms of frequency of occurrence (%FO), the most frequent group were the \n\ncrustaceans (53.5%), mostly represented by the decapods (34.8%). The fish group was \n\nless frequent (37.2%), 32.6% of which corresponding to N.i. Fish. The least frequent \n\ngroup was the cephalopods (9.3%), where the N.i.

However, the most \n\nimportant prey was the N.i. Fish (67%), followed by the decapods (25%). The least \n\nimportant group as a whole was the cephalopods (2%), with the N.i.

Prey classifications \n\nAs happened for E. spinax, the indices calculated for the diet of E. pusillus were \n\ndivided into different groups according to the order of importance for each type of prey, \n\nobtaining also three groups for each index. The first group (G.I) consisted in the IRI index, \n\nand the second one (G.II) was composed by the IPO2 index (Tab. 3.12). \n\nIn respect to the different indices analysis it was possible to verify that the \n\nprincipal preys in the diet of E. pusillus were the N.i. Fish group, SbO. Natantia and O. \n\nEuphausiacea. The groups of indices are fairly homogenous until 3th category, where \n\nthese groups begin to have slight variations according to the principal order.

Fish, the 1st in the ranking order, is the \n\npreferential prey, SbO.

Diversity indices \n\nConcerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition of E. \n\npusillus was possible to observe that this species present similar and very low values of \n\neach index, some of them near 0 and other being 0. Therefore resulting values of 0.2 \u00b1 \n\n0.39; 0.4 \u00b1 0.68 and 0.3 \u00b1 0.45 for diversity, richness and evenness indices, respectively. \n\n3.2.3. Relationship between sex and diet \n\nIn the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of each deep-water shark \n\nspecies only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. \n\nThe IRI index was used because it combines all quantitative indices (N, FO, and W) that \n\nwhile giving more importance to the frequency of occurrence, it also discriminates better \n\nbetween values of the index allowing an effective evaluation of the importance of each \n\ntype of prey to predator diet. \n\nThe vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk obtained \n\nfor the sex variable of E. pusillus was calculated, taking into account the total number of \n\nstomachs of each sex. These results are shown in the following table (Tab. 3.15). \n\nTable 3.15: Vacuity Index (VI) and percentages of unidentified bulk (N.i.

In terms of IRI, these groups of prey represented 44.1% \n\nand 50.8%. Decapoda and Euphausiacea orders were the crustaceans prey items which \n\ncontributed most to IRI (5.5% and 11%, respectively) and also the N.i. Fish (IRI=72.8%) \n\n(Fig. 3.26) (Annex 28). \n\n \nFigure 3.26: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative \n\nimportance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of the female specimens of E. pusillus (N=7). \n\nMales \n\nIn the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet for the male specimens of \n\nE. pusillus and taking into account the empty stomachs, 25 stomachs was analyzed. \n\nAccording to the quantitative analysis (Annex 17), crustaceans were the main component \n\nin the diet of Smooth Lanternshark male specimens. The prey items of crustaceans which \n\ncontributed most to IRI were the decapods (39.9%), but the N.i. Fish had also an elevated \n\nrelative importance (55.7%) (Fig. 3.27) (Annex 29). \n\n \nFigure 3.27: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative \n\nimportance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of E. pusillus male specimens (N=25). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCephalopods Crustaceans Fish\n\n(%\n)\n\nGroup ofprey\n\nFemale\n\nE. pusillus\n\nIRIc\n\n%N\n\n%W\n\n%FOc\n\nOegopsida\n\n7.5%\nDecapoda\n\n5.5%\n\nEuphausiacea\n\n11.0%\n\nN.i.

Diversity indices \n\nConcerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition \n\nbetween sexes for E. pusillus species, was possible to observe that both females and males \n\npresent low values of each index. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.5 \u00b1 0.59 for female \n\nand 0.2 \u00b1 0.31 for male specimens. In addition, the values obtained of species richness \n\nfor females and males were 0.7 \u00b1 0.94 and 0.4 \u00b1 0.61, respectively. Finally, in case of \n\nspecies evenness, the values obtained were 0.5 \u00b1 0.50 for females and 0.2 \u00b1 0.42 for \n\nmales. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a statistically \n\nsignificant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed p-values  p = \n\n0.143, p = 0.224 and p = 0.111. \n\n3.2.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis \n\nThe classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items \n\nfound in the diet of female and male specimens of E. pusillus indicated that, at the 17% \n\nsimilarity level, the 32 specimens\u2019 combination (only specimens with prey items into the \n\nstomachs) falls into four groups of clusters, of which three clusters were isolated. The \n\nmain group of clusters was composed of different combinations between both sexes of E. \n\nspinax specimens. The last three isolated groups of clusters consisted in two immature \n\nmales captured in spring and one immature female capture in spring (Fig. 3.28) \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the \n\ndiet for both sexes of E. pusillus specimens. The four groups defined at similarity level of 17% are indicated \n\nby the dashed line. \n\nThe result of MDS analysis corresponds to the main group of CLUSTERS \n\nanalysis. Then it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into account, \n\nbecause in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. Hence \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nit was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of similarity. \n\nThe stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.08, which indicates a good \n\nrepresentation of the ordination in a 2D graphic (Fig. 3.29). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29: MDS plot of relative importance in the diet for both sexes of E .pusillus specimens. The main \n\ngroup defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the dashed line. \n \n\nIn addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not significant \n\ndifferences in the diet composition of female and males specimens of E. pusillus \n\n(ANOSIM test, R=0.021, p > 0.05).  \n\nConcerning to SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average \n\ncontribution of the prey items to the similarity in the diet of both sexes of E. pusillus \n\nspecimens were 28.56% for females and 39.97% for male specimens. In terms of relative \n\nimportance, N.i. Crustaceans, N.i. Fish and SbO. Natantia were the prey items most \n\nresponsible for the similarity in the diet between females and males of E. pusillus. In the \n\ncase of female specimens, the contribution percentages of N.i. Crustaceans, N.i. Fish and \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nSbO. Natantia were 50.40%, 34.19% and 11.84%, respectively, and for male specimens \n\nwere 56.02%, 25.12% and 12.73%, respectively (Tab. 3.16). \n\nTable 3.16: SIMPER results for the relative importance of prey items between female (F) and male (M) \n\nspecimens of E. pusillus.

Comparison Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus pusillus \n\nRegarding the comparison between both diets, and in terms of feeding overlap, it \n\nwas verified that the diet of both shark species are subjected to a high level of overlap, \n\nobtaining values above ?=0.6. The overlap values obtained for the %N, %W, %FOc and \n\nIRIc indices were ?=0.64, ?=0.60, ?=0.62, ?= 0.53, respectively.  \n\n Concerning the position in the trophic chain, the trophic levels of each deep-water \n\nshark was calculated. Therefore, values of 3.8 for E. spinax and 4.1 for E. pusillus were \n\nobtained.  \n\n3.3.1. Diversity \n\nConcerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition \n\nbetween both deep-water sharks species, was possible to observe that all indices present \n\nlow values for each predator species, obtaining the following results. In case of the \n\ndiversity index, the value obtained for E. spinax was somewhat higher (0.3 \u00b1 0.47) than \n\nfor E. pusillus (0.2 \u00b1 0.39). In addition, the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was calculated \n\nand there was not a statistically significant difference (P = 0.451). \n\nOn the other hand, similar values with the richness of species were observed in \n\nboth diets. Thus the values of average and standard deviation obtained for E. spinax were \n\n0.5 \u00b1 0.72, while the values for E. pusillus were 0.4 \u00b1 0.68. Hence, there was not a \n\nstatistically significant difference (P = 0.573) in the species richness values for both diets. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nAccording the species evenness index (J\u2019), the values of average and standard \n\ndeviation obtained for E. spinax were 0.4 \u00b1 0.45, while the values for E. pusillus were 0.3 \n\n\u00b1 0.45. Then, there was not statistically significant difference (P = 0.864) in the species \n\nevenness index values for both diets.  \n\n3.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis \n\nThe classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items \n\nfound in the diet of both Etmopterus species indicated that, at the 17% similarity level, \n\nthe 129 specimens\u2019 combination (only specimens with prey items into the stomachs) falls \n\ninto eight main groups or clusters, of which four clusters was isolated. Two of the main \n\nclusters consisted of the E. spinax specimens, another cluster was formed by E. spinax \n\n(n=7) and E. pusillus (n=1; immature female captured in spring) specimens and the third \n\none was composed of different combinations between both deep-water shark species. The \n\nfirst and third clusters isolated consisted in one specimen of E. spinax in each one (both \n\ncorresponded to mature male specimens captured in summer), the second one and the \n\nfourth one cluster consisted in one specimen of E. pusillus in each one (2nd: immature \n\nfemale captured in spring and 4th: immature male captured in spring) (Fig. 3.30). \n\nThe result of MDS analysis also corresponds to the first four groups of \n\nCLUSTERS analysis. For this analysis it is important to note that the isolated clusters \n\nwere not taken into account, so it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with \n\nhigh percentage of similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.08, which \n\nindicates a good 2D ordination with less probabilities of misrepresentative interpretation \n\n(Fig. 3.31).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.30: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in \n\nthe diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus specimens.

(   : A, B, C, D and E). \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nIn addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are slight differences \n\nbetween the diet composition of both E. spinax and E. pusillus, but these differences are \n\nsignificant (ANOSIM test, R=0. 156, p &lt;0.05).  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.31: MDS plot of relative importance in the diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus specimens.

In terms of relative importance N.i. Crustaceans (N.i. \n\nCrust) (25.87%), SbO. Natantia (SbO. Natn) (23.08%) and N.i.

DISCUSSION \n\nThis research is focused on the diet study of two species of small deep-water \n\nsharks, the Velvet belly (Etmopterus spinax) and Smooth lanternshark (Etmopterus \n\npusillus), along the Algarve coast and taking into account different variables (sex, \n\nmaturity stage and season), which influence diet composition of both species.  \n\nDespite the considerable number of samples of E. spinax, the number of stomachs \n\nanalysed from E. pusillus was lower and come from different times of sampling and for \n\nthis reason, a comprehensive analysis of the presented results should be done with \n\ncaution.  \n\n4.1. General diet composition  \n\nIn the northeast Atlantic, especially along the Algarve coast, the diets of E. spinax \n\nand E. pusillus are based primarily on organisms with pelagic and demersal affinities, \n\nsuch as crustaceans, teleost fish and cephalopods. The present study is in accordance with \n\nXavier et al. (2006), who analyzed the diet composition of deep-water shark species and \n\nfound that Etmopterus spp. feed primarily on crustaceans, fish and cephalopods. \n\nMoreover, a significant component of their diets are organisms with diel vertical \n\nmigrations such as Pasiphaea sivado and euphausiids, but others showing demersal \n\ndistribution (e.g.  Micromesistius poutassou) were also observed (Neiva et al., 2006; \n\nXavier et al., 2012). Pelagic organisms represent one of the main food sources for many \n\ndemersal communities (Mauchline et al., 1991 in Xavier et al., 2012; Blaber et al., 2002). \n\nThereby, according to Neiva et al. (2006), Sims et al. (2006) and Xavier et al. (2012), it \n\ncan be suggested that E. spinax and E. pusillus could perform vertical feeding migrations, \n\nwhich is a common behavior in sharks. However, it is important to note that further \n\nevidences are required to confirm this behavior pattern in the genus Etmopterus (Xavier \n\net al., 2012).  \n\n Regarding the diet composition of both deep-water sharks species studied it is \n\ninteresting to point out that usually all species of prey consumed by E. spinax and E. \n\npusillus are bioluminescent (Neiva et al., 2006). Therefore it is possible that these \n\npredators have a visual adaption that plays an important role in detecting and capturing \n\nthis type of prey, as referred to by Neiva et al. (2006). \n\nIn terms of relative importance (IRI), crustaceans were the main group in the diet \n\nof E. spinax (IRI=70.3%), particularly representatives of the Order Decapoda, followed \n\nby teleost fishes (IRI=22.2%) and cephalopods (IRI=7.4%). Decapods were dominant \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nboth in number (44.6%), frequency of occurrence (42.9%) and relative importance \n\n(67.1%), but fishes (mainly unidentified) were the most abundant in terms of weight \n\n(40.5%): these results are consistent with values reported by Costa et al. (2002). In the \n\nsame way, concerning the relative importance of prey found in the E. pusillus diet, it was \n\nobserved that crustaceans and fishes were the principal groups of prey (IRI=50.4% and \n\n47.8%, respectively), (particularly the decapods (25.1%)), followed by cephalopods \n\n(IRI=1.8%). The similar importance to both groups (crustaceans and fish) in the diet could \n\nbe due to the fact that composition diet of E. pusillus varies according to different factors, \n\nsuch as the need to consume preys which provide the highest amount of energy possible, \n\nas long as these prey are available. In addition, in respect to the taxonomic orders, the \n\nOrder Euphausiacea dominated in terms of numbers (26.9%), whilst the unidentified fish \n\ngroup was the most relevant in terms of weight and relative importance (%W=75.9% and \n\nIRI=66.7%).  \n\nRegarding the Relative Importance Index (IRI), and according to Clarke et al. \n\n(1995), it is important to note that the determination of relative importance for \n\ncephalopods and fish in the diets can raise some problems. The identification of \n\ncephalopods and fishes from remaining hard structures (beaks and otoliths) can be \n\ncomplicated and, most of the times, does not allows a reliable identification of the prey. \n\nIn contrast, identification of crustaceans present in the gut is facilitated by the fact that \n\ntheir structures remain almost intact. Consequently, IRI values obtained for fish and \n\ncephalopods were low (and underestimated), due to the weight of the hard structures \n\nbeing very low (0.01 g approximately), influencing the index final estimations.  \n\nIn contrast with other studies (Neiva et al., 2006; Valls et al., 2011), in this \n\nresearch the diet of E. spinax was not dominated by teleost fish, such as Micromesistius \n\npoutassou (IRI=0.01%), nor by cephalopods such as Sepiolids (IRI=0.4%). Moreover the \n\nprevious two preys were absented in the diet of E. pusillus. Nevertheless, the fish group \n\nhad an important contribution in terms of weight for both deep-water species, 40% for E. \n\nspinax and 76% for E. pusillus, particularly with unidentified fish. This is in accordance \n\nwith what was reported by Bergstad et al. (2003) in their study. In addition, there are three \n\nmain factors that suggest that E. pusillus species feeds intermittently, in accordance with \n\nthe study carried out by Xavier et al. (2012): the frequent observation of a limited amount \n\nof food items in their stomachs, the presence of many prey in advanced digestion stages, \n\nand the high number of empty stomachs (overall vacuity index=44.8%).  \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nOtherwise the benthic organisms such as reptantid decapods, polychaetes and \n\nechinoderms were not part in the diet of both species studied, except the Order \n\nPleuronectiformes with a %FO of 3% in E. spinax and 2% in E. pusillus, respectively. \n\nFurthermore, an 11% of sediment (%FO) was found in the stomach contents of E. spinax. \n\nUsually, the ingestion of small amounts of sediment can suggest that this species is also \n\nforaged near the bottom (Costa et al., 2002). In contrast, sediments were not found in the \n\nstomach contents of E. pusillus. Thus, these results suggests that E. pusillus feeds mainly \n\non benthopelagic prey, as suggested Neiva et al. (2006), but also prey with epibenthic \n\naffinities. \n\nConcerning the statistical analysis used to know the existence of significant \n\ndifferences, the ANOSIM test showed that there were slight different in the diet \n\ncompositions between both species of deep-water sharks, and these differences were \n\nsignificant. These differences could be related with the more importance the fish species \n\nhave in the E. pusillus diet and with the differences in feeding behaviour raised above. \n\nOn the other hand, the results obtained in this study about the diet overlap between \n\nE. spinax and E. pusillus indicated that, despite the existence of slight differences in their \n\nfeeding habits, the diet overlap was high (? > 0.6). This index was estimated in order to \n\nunderstand how species that utilize common resources, such as food or space, coexist. \n\nThis fact is due to that each species in a community has a determined position in the \n\ntrophic chain, including its use of food resources, activity time, location, form of \n\ninteraction with other species, among other factors (Ludwing and Reynolds, 1988). \n\nRegarding the trophic level, the values obtained for these species are in agreement with \n\nCort\u00e9s (1999), where both species are in the same trophic level, corresponding TL= 3.8 \n\n(E. spinax) and TL= 4.1 (E. pusillus). Furthermore, their trophic level values are similar \n\nto the values obtained for species with the same distribution, such as Etmopterus princeps \n\n(TL= 4.2), Scyliorhinus canicula (TL= 3.6) and Galeus melastomus (TL= 3.7) (Cort\u00e9s, \n\n1999), being this fact probably related with their benthopelagic life style. Cort\u00e9s (1999) \n\nand Neiva et al. (2006) stated that the body length and trophic level were moderately \n\ncorrelated, suggesting that larger species have a higher trophic level than smaller species, \n\ndue to larger species can also consume cetaceans and other elasmobranchs. In the same \n\nway, Gamito et al. (2005) suggested for species, such as Spondyliosoma cantharus and \n\nSparus auratus, that the elevated trophic level can be related with the consumed amount \n\nof teleost fish. Hence, and according to those authors, the species with a diet rich in teleost \n\nhave a higher trophic level values than species with a poor diet in teleost.  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nThe degree of overlap found in the diets of both deep-water shark species can \n\nindicate competition or resource partitioning. Results presented in this study allowed \n\nobserving that both species use the same feeding resources, although in different \n\nproportions. In the case of E. spinax the preferential prey was the crustacean group, \n\nspecifically the Natantia order. However, the preferential prey for E. pusillus was the fish \n\ngroup, specifically the N.i. Fish. This can indicate a resource partitioning between both \n\nshark species. Preliminary analysis (in progress and unpublished) of the stable isotopic \n\ncomposition of carbon and nitrogen in muscle of E. spinax and E. pusillus support feeding \n\noverlap but different foraging strategies, providing further evidence of resource \n\npartitioning among these species. Moreover, this fact can also suggest that both deep-\n\nwater shark species feeding on locally abundant resources off the Algarve coast (Xavier \n\net al., 2012). Here the Euphausiids, P. sivado and M. poutassou are key taxa in the \n\nregional marine food web (Santos et al., 2001). The variation of the diets can be related \n\nto the abundance or scarcity of food, so the description of their feeding ecology just \n\npresent a momentary image of available resources during the performance of this study.  \n\nWhen compared with other studies it could be seen that in the present study there \n\nwere a lower number of prey items, namely consumed by E. pusillus (10 vs 26 prey taxa, \n\nXavier et al., 2012) and by E. spinax (19 vs 29 prey taxa Neiva et al. 2006).  However, \n\nthe values of diversity, richness and evenness obtained for the diets of E. spinax and E. \n\npusillus, were low and very similar (E. spinax H\u2019= 0.3; R1= 0.5; J\u2019= 0.4 and E. pusillus \n\nH\u2019=0.2; R1= 0.4; J\u2019= 0.3).  One reason of obtaining low values of species diversity, \n\nrichness and evenness in their diets can be associated to the low number of specimens \n\ncaught for the analysis, as was in case of E. pusillus, and/or the advanced stage of \n\ndigestion of many of the prey items that did not allow identification to the species level \n\nfor some taxonomic groups.  \n\nThe diversity and richness of items consumed is indicative of the ecological \n\nspecialization of their predators, particularly being designated as specialist, opportunist \n\nor generalist feeders. Lower values of these indices suggest that this predator species \n\nmight have a strict diet, i.e it is relatively specialist, while higher values suggest a possible \n\ngeneralist diet, where the predator shows a rich and diverse consumption of prey \n\navailable. Also, the low values of species evenness in their diets can suggest that the prey \n\nitems consumed have not a uniformly distribution in their diets. Moreover, it is important \n\nto note that, as mentioned by Mauchline &amp; Gordon (1985), the diversity indices applied \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nto the feeding ecology have a high degree of subjectivity. For this reasons, the results here \n\npresented should be interpreted with caution.  \n\nThe ecological specialization can be assigned from the diagram (Fig. 4.1) adapted \n\nfrom Costello (1990), which suggests that E. spinax and E. pusillus have a specialist diet, \n\nalso reported in Neiva et al. (2006) and Xavier et al. (2012), and eventually opportunistic \n\ndiet. Despite the observations, allowed by the stomach content analysis, are not entirely \n\nconclusive, one can assume that the studied sharks are not generalist-feeders. It is \n\nimportant to note that the differences in the proportions of the diversity values in respect \n\nto several authors, it may be due to the quantitative and qualitative variations in the \n\nbenthic and ichthyologic populations to the local study, in this case the coast of Algarve.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: Explanatory diagram of the proposed method of diet analysis by Costello (1990). \n\nXavier et al. (2012) recorded that the vacuity index may be related with the fishing \n\ngear used and its selectivity. Usually the specimens caught by trawling have fuller \n\nstomachs than those caught by longline. In the case of longline captures the specimens \n\nare hooked on bait so their stomachs sometimes contain the bait remains and it is assumed \n\nthat when a fish is hooked is because it was hungry and thus with a higher probability of \n\nhaving an empty stomach. On the contrary, in the captures by trawling the specimens can \n\nhave their stomachs full and even eat while they are within the net. In contrast to Xavier \n\net al. (2012), in this study there seems to be no influence of the fishing gear/selectivity \n\non the vacuity index. This was reflected on the high values of vacuity presented by the \n\nspecimens caught by trawling, both for E. spinax (43.9%) and for E. pusillus (44.8%). \n\nThis highest vacuity values can be influenced by the trawling time, because this fishing \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nmethod can take several hours and the stomachs may become completely digested and \n\nnon-identifiable, as Costa et al. (2002) suggested. \n\n4.2. Diet composition according to sex and maturity stages \n\n The segregation of the sexes between the species is a general behavior \n\nphenomenon observed in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Sims, 2006). Sharks can be \n\nan appropriate model to test theories on the mechanisms underlying sexual segregation. \n\nThis is a common characteristic in shark populations (Sims, 2006), where juveniles as \n\nwell as male and female adults begin to separate into different groups (Springer, 1967). \n\n Concerning their diet compositions and corroborating the authors Neiva et al. \n\n(2006) and Xavier et al. (2012) findings, this study showed that the diet composition \n\nbetween sexes of each deep-water shark species did not present significant differences. \n\nAlthough the diet of E. spinax male specimens showed a higher heterogeneity diet than \n\nfemales. In the same way the maturity was not a significant source of variation in the diet \n\nof E. spinax. Furthermore and in terms of diversity, richness and evenness of species in \n\ntheir diets no statistically significant differences between sexes were also obtained for \n\neach species in study. \n\nFor the same species, the sizes between mature females and males are usually \n\ndifferent. This seems to be related with the reproduction mode (Sims, 2006). Most shark \n\nspecies present larger females than males, this could mean that sexual segregation plays \n\nan important role in the different energy requirements between males and females (Sims, \n\n2006). Regarding their length at first maturity, it was also significantly higher for females \n\nthan males. According to Coelho et al. (2005), E. spinax first maturity was 30.86 cm for \n\nfemales and 25.39 cm for males, while for E. pusillus was 43.60 cm for females and 38.10 \n\ncm for males. So both E. spinax and E. pusillus have a low growth rate and late maturing, \n\nwhich makes these populations extremely vulnerable to increasing fishing mortality, as \n\nsuggested the Coelho et al. (2005) study. \n\n Regarding the diet compositions of both studied species and in terms of IRI, the \n\ncrustaceans were the most important group of prey for immature females and males in E. \n\nspinax species. Nevertheless the fish were the most important group in the diet \n\ncomposition of mature males of E. spinax, but not for the mature females, whose diet was \n\ncomposed mainly by crustaceans. This suggests that the ontogenetic shift in the diet of E. \n\nspinax is probably due to the low selectivity of increasingly larger specimens in the \n\nselection of the prey size (Neiva et al., 2006). On the other hand, Xavier et al. (2012) \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nsuggest that in the E. pusillus diet, the fish increase in importance as the specimens \n\nincrease in size. However, in spite the same has been observed, due to the low number of \n\nE. pusillus specimens obtained to carry out the present study, it was not possible to prove \n\nthis evidence. Furthermore, Jakobsd\u00f3ttir (2001) studied the diet of the shark \n\nCentroscyllium fabricii, which is in the same order as E. spinax and E. pusillus and she \n\nverified that the diet of the small/immature specimens of this species was based mainly \n\non crustaceans and some fish (opportunistically), while diet of larger/mature specimens \n\nwas mainly composed of fish. On the other hand, the amount of prey items in terms of \n\nnumber and weight (especially for the fish group), was usually higher in mature than in \n\nimmature specimens of E. spinax. This can be affected by their reproductive cycle, as the \n\nfish group provides a large energetic value for overcoming this period, which requires a \n\nlot of energy. The study of Lopez et al. (2009) for the shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, also \n\nsuggested that the higher consumption of fish is due to the large migrations of this species, \n\nwhich uses a large amount of energy.  \n\nIt is also interesting to suggest that the preference of the specimens for smaller or \n\nlarger prey may be related with size of the predator\u2019s mouth (Erzini et al., 1997). The \n\nmouth size of the individuals is related to their total length, therefore it is also connected \n\nto the size of the dominant prey found in their diets. It is also related with the stomach \n\nstorage capacity, the swimming capability and energetic requirements, which accompany \n\nthe growth of the predator and are important characteristics for the prey selection (Neiva \n\net al. (2006). Thus it is probable that with the increase of specimen size the diet becomes \n\nmore diverse in terms of prey size (Neiva et al., 2006). Consequently, the fact that larger \n\nspecimens feed on larger species of prey may reduce the competition between both intra- \n\nand inter- species, just as Fanelli et al. (2009) suggested for E. spinax and G. melastomus. \n\n4.3. Diet composition according to the season \n\n The analysis of the diet of both deep-water shark species for the different seasons, \n\nand separating them between warm season (summer and spring) and cold season (winter \n\nand autumn) showed that the crustaceans remain the main prey items in the diet \n\ncomposition during all seasons. \n\nThe diet was richest during warm season for E. spinax, obtaining larger amount \n\nof items prey in warm season (n=167) than cold season (n=109). Generally, this study \n\nshowed that E. spinax does not change diet seasonally. This means that they feed on the \n\nsame prey groups along the year, although slight differences in their abundance, \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nfrequency of occurrence and relative importance were observed. This result contrast with \n\nconclusions obtained by Anastasopoulou et al. (2013), who found seasonal shifts on the \n\ndiet of another deepwater shark, namely Galeus melastomus, in the eastern Ionian Sea. In \n\nterms of IRI, %N and %FO, the diet composition for E. spinax during all year was \n\ncomposed mainly by crustaceans, being the decapods the most important type of prey. In \n\nthe same way occurred for E. pusillus, but during the warm season. Otherwise, in terms \n\nof %W the fish group was most representative during hot season (51% for E. spinax and \n\n76.1% for E. pusillus).  \n\nIn contrast to some studies (Fanelly et al., 2009, Anastasopoulou et al., 2013 and \n\nCosta et al.,2002), this research did not show significant differences in the ANOSIM \n\nanalysis of the diet composition of E. spinax in different season categories.  In addition, \n\nno statistically significant differences between seasons were also obtained for E. spinax \n\nand for each index of diversity, richness and evenness.  \n\nThese facts could be explain by many factors which can affect to the diet \n\ncomposition of the predators (Cailliet (1977) in Gon\u00e7alves (2000)). Shifts in diets can be \n\na result of the amount of food available, migrations of prey and/or variations in water \n\ntemperature (Gon\u00e7alves, 2000). The absence of a seasonal variation in the diet can be \n\nrelated to a relative constancy in values of temperature in the deep sea. Usually \n\ntemperature variations are more evident in shallow waters than at greater depths, with \n\neffects on prey composition, fluctuations in abundance, and/or changes in distribution in \n\nthe water column. Finally, high fishing pressure can have an impact on the prey \n\ncommunities, leading to the disruption of the food web with unpredictable effects on top \n\npredators. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n4.4. General conclusions: \n\nThe ecological importance and pressure that deep-water communities are subject \n\nin the context of human activities and climate change make basic biology studies very \n\nimportant in the understanding of the ecology of still considerably unknown species. \n\nThis work is a valid contribution for the evaluation of the trophic relationships of \n\ntwo deepwater shark species from the Portuguese south coast and a common component \n\nof the crustacean fishery in the region as a result of bycatch. \n\nThe results here presented indicated that Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus \n\npusillus are benthopelagic feeders, with a certain degree of specialization and eventually \n\nopportunistic behavior. The diet composition of both sharks is dominated by crustaceans, \n\nfish and cephalopods, suggesting a high degree of overlap between species. This indicates \n\nthey are sharing prey resources, but also suggesting that they feed on abundant species \n\npresent off the Algarve coast.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the diet \n\ncomposition diversity, richness and evenness of prey species, between sexes, maturity \n\nstages and seasons for each species, which reveals common patterns and strategies in \n\nrelatively stable environment. The slight differences found between the diets of the two \n\nlantern sharks were probably due to a higher preference for fish and for preys less \n\ndependent on the bottom by the E. pusillus. The variability in the diet of E. spinax showed \n\na preference of immature specimens for crustaceans and the mature specimens for fish. \n\nThis is probably related with their mouth sizes, stomachs storage capacity, swimming \n\ncapacity and their energy needs. \n\nFinally, differences found between the present study and previously reported diet \n\ncomposition for these species might be related with changes in the community structure \n\nof the prey-components caused both by natural variation and bottom trawling. However, \n\nmore evidences are needed to draw further conclusions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5                                                   REFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n5.
