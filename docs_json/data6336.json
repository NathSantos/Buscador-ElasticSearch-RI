Estas situa\u00e7\u00f5es patol\u00f3gicas, que t\u00eam diferentes causas, afetam a mobilidade e a qualidade de vida do indiv\u00edduo. Os tratamentos actuais contemplam a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de enxertos \u00f3sseos, que na sua maioria s\u00e3o autoenxertos. No entanto, estes apresentam algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, como seja o estado de sa\u00fade do paciente que limita a obten\u00e7\u00e3o do enxerto, a extens\u00e3o da les\u00e3o \u00f3ssea, e ainda a possibilidade de inflingir um maior sofrimento no doente. Este tipo de enxertos nem sempre permitem uma completa recupera\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, surge a Engenharia de Tecidos como \u00e1rea interdisciplinar que utiliza biomateriais e mol\u00e9culas bioacti-vas para desenvolver dispositivos que permitam efectuar a repara\u00e7\u00e3o ou substitui\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido \u00f3sseo. Uma das abordagens mais utilizadas envolve a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \u201cscaffolds\u201d, que s\u00e3o matrizes tridimensionais, que tomam papel de molde tempor\u00e1rio para a ades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celulares, fornecendo suporte mec\u00e2nico durante a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea. Uma abordagem particularmente promissora utiliza a tecnologia de prototipagem r\u00e1pida para produzir \u201cscaffolds\u201d com estrutura detalhada, utilizado modelos computacionais ou dados provenientes de exames m\u00e9dicos de rotina. O presente estudo descreve a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o fisicoqu\u00edmica, mec\u00e2nica e biol\u00f3gica de \u201cscaffolds\u201d tridimensionais produzidos com ^-Tricalciofosfato/Alginato, utilizando prototi-pagem r\u00e1pida. A Espectroscopia de Infravermelho por Transformada de Fourier, Difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de Raio-X, \u00c2ngulo de Contacto e Microscopia Electr\u00f3nica de Varrimento foram usadas na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da estabilidade mec\u00e2nica, superf\u00edcie e porosidade dos \u201cscaffolds\u201d produzidos. O perfil citot\u00f3xico dos \u201cscaffolds\u201d foi estudado atrav\u00e9s de ensaios de MTS in vitro, utilizando osteoblas-tos humanos como c\u00e9lulas modelo. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que os \u201cscaffolds\u201d produzidos apresentam \u00f3ptimas propriedades biol\u00f3gicas e fisicoqu\u00edmicas, suportando a ades\u00e3o e prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celulares. Os materiais produzidos demonstraram possuir excelente resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica, igualando ou excedendo as propriedades do osso trabecular, demonstrando o seu pot\u00eancial para serem usados na regenera\u00e7\u00e3o de tecido \u00f3sseo.\nPalavras-Chave\n\u201cScaffolds\u201d ^-Tricalciofosfato/Alginato, Desenho Assistido por Computador, PVA, Prototipagem R\u00e1pida, Engenharia de Tecidos\nResumo alargado\nO osso \u00e9 um tecido altamente din\u00e2nimo e vascularizado, e \u00e9 o principal componente do esqueleto humano.

Wether due to trauma or pathology, if the bone tissue is compromised it constitutes a serious threat to the well being of the individual. Current solutions for bone defects involve the use of bone grafts, particularly autografts. However, these present serious limitations for their use, such as limited availability, or the possibility of chronic pain, and may not allow the patient's full recovery. In this context, Tissue Engineering emerged as a potential solution, since it uses biomaterials and bioactive molecules to develop devices that allow the repair or regeneration of bone tissue. One of the most researched approaches are scaffolds, that are three dimensional matrices, aimed to act as temporary templates for cell adhesion and proliferation, offering mechanical support while the bone tissue regenerates. A particularly promising approach uses rapid prototyping technology to produce 3D scaffolds with highly controlled structure, either from CAD models, or routine exam medical data. The present study describes the physicochemical, mechanical and biological characterization of 3D ^-TCP/Alginate scaffold, produced by rapid prototyping. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Contact Angle, and Scanning Electron Microscopy were used to characterize the porosity, surface hydrophilic character and chemical composition of the produced scaffolds. In addition, the mechanical stability (Compressive Strength and Young's Modulus) was also evaluated. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds was evaluated by in vitro MTS assays, using human osteoblasts as model cells. The results obtained showed that the produced scaffolds present excellent biological and physicochemical properties, allowing for the adhesion and proliferation of human osteoblasts. Moreover, the produced scaffolds presented remarkable mechanical strength, matching or surpassing the properties of native trabecular bone, which is fundamental for their potential use in the regeneration of bone tissue.\nKeywords\n^-Tricalcium Phosphate/Alginate scaffolds, Computer-Aided Design, PVA, Rapid prototyping,\nTissue engineering\nContents\n1\tIntroduction\t1\n1.1\tBone

the main component of the human skeleton1\u20192. The principal function of the skeleton is to provide structural support to the body3, allowing motion by opposing muscular contractions and withstanding functional loads1,4, while protecting the internal organs, especially the heart, lungs, and spinal cord5. It is also involved in different biological functions, namely the production of blood cells through hematopoiesis3, and ion storage, mainly phosphorous and calcium2,3.\nIn spite of a complex structure, bone tissue can be divided in cells and bone matrix. Different types of bone cells are found in bone tissue, each presenting a specific function: osteoblasts, that are known as bone forming cells; osteocytes, involved in bone maintenance; and osteoclasts, that perform bone remodelling5. With distinct origins and functions, each cell type is essential for the production and maintenance of the bone matrix.\nBone matrix is composed by an inorganic and organic phase, in a 65/35% ratio6. The organic phase is mainly composed of collagen and proteoglicans, while the inorganic phase is composed by calcium phosphate crystals, in the form of HA (hidroxyapatite)2,3,6.\n1.2\tBone anatomy\nBones are exceptionally well suited for the structural demands of the human body, providing high strength and durability while minimizing weight. Moreover, during the lifetime of each individual, the shape, anatomy and mechanical properties may be changed in response to external stimulus4.\nBones can be classified according to their shape into long, short, flat or irregular3,6. Long bones present a cylinder like shape, representing most of the bones of the upper and lower limbs. As hollow tubes, they provide great strength and durability against axial compression forces, while minimizing weight4. Short bones resemble a cubic or spheric shape, such as the carpal bones from the wrist, or the tarsal bones, from the ankle6. Flat bones, on the other hand, present thin, curved or flat shapes, being the ribs and scapulae examples of this type of bone. Irregular bones have complex shapes that are neither long, short, nor flat, such as the vertebrae and facial bones3,6. Bones can also be classified by structure in trabecular, also called cancellous or spongy bone (about 20% of the total skeleton), and cortical or compact bone (about 80% of the total skeleton) 2,3,6.\nIn addition, the outer surface of the bone is covered by a bi-layered connective tissue membrane, the periosteum. The outer, fibrous layer, is made of irregular collagenous tissue, which contains blood vessels and nerves, while the inner layer is composed by a single layer of bone cells. These facilitate the fixation of tendons or ligaments to the bone.\nThe endosteum is a connective tissue membrane that covers the internal surfaces of all bone cavities, and it is composed by a single layer of cells6\u20197.\nEach growing long bone can be further characterized by three different sections: the diaphysis that composes the bulk of the bone, the epiphysis, located at the ends of the bone, and the epiphyseal plate, located where new bone is formed during growing6-8.\nAn important structure within the long bones is present in the diaphysis, that can contain the medullary cavity. This cavity, together with the cavities in cancellous bone, is filled with marrow. Blood cell formation occurs in the red marrow, while yellow marrow is mainly adipose tissue, with adults presenting mostly the former, except for a few particular bones6,7. This yellow marrow can act as a localized energy reservoir in emergency situations, like bone fractures9.\nFlat, short and irregular bones usually present a cancellous interior surrounded by two layers of compact bone, with the cancellous centre filled with marrow6,8.\nOn a smaller scale, bone can be also classified as woven or lamellar, according to the fibres organization3,4,6. Woven bone presents randomly oriented collagen fibres, and usually occurs during growing stages, such as foetal development or fracture repair. It is typically remodelled to form lamellar bone3,4.\nLamellar bone is a layered type of bone, composed of 3-7 pm lamellae, with collagen fibres lying parallel to each other4,6.\nA brief schematic of the internal structure and organization of bone tissue is presented on figure\n1.1.\nNerve\nNerve\nTrabeculae\nCanaliculus\nBlood> vessels\nBlood vessels\nOsteonic canal\nLacunax (space) \u25a0Osteocyte\nPerforating canal\nOsteon\n--------Osteonic canal\n'\tcontaining vessels\nand nerves\n,\t/Periosteum\nNerve/\nEndosteum\nCompact bone\nFigure 1.1: Schematic view of bone tissue structure and organization. Adapted from Booth 10\n1.3\tBone histology\n1.3.1\tBone matrix\nAs previously described, bone matrix is a composite of organic and inorganic materials, in a 35/65% ratio6. The organic phase is mainly constituted by collagen and proteoglycans, and the inorganic by calcium phosphate crystals. These components are in a delicate balance, if the mineral is diminished, the bone becomes more flexible, due to increased collagen. If, on the other hand, the collagen is removed, the bone becomes mainly composed of mineral, and thus very brittle6,11.\nThe bone matrix composition also changes with age, with the decreasing bone turnover causing an increase in the mineralization degree, thus leading to a decrease in bone collagen con-tent12,13.\n1.3.2\tBone cells\nOsteoblasts are mononuclear and basophilic cells with a large spherical nucleus, and highly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus14. In addition, these cells present secretory behaviour, producing collagen and proteoglycans and releasing them to the surrounding environment6,15. They also release matrix vesicles, on which Ca2+ and PO43-are concentrated to form HA crystals. These will then act like seeds for mineralization of the matrix. In this way, osteoblasts create new ECM (extracellular matrix) and regulate its mineralization. These cuboid shaped cells can live up to 8 weeks, depositing 0.5-1.5 pm of osteoid per day4,6. On the other hand, osteoblasts also act as bone lining cells during the quiescence phase of bone16.\nOsteocytes are osteoblasts that have become surrounded by bone matrix, but are morphologically and functionally different16,17. These types of cells account for 90/95% of all cells in the bone. They are relatively inactive, but can still produce the components needed to maintain the bone matrix6,17.\nCurrently, it is believed that these cells may actually modulate the spatial and temporal formation and resorption of bone tissue, through the high number of dendritic processes that interconnect the osteocytes and the bone lining cells4,6,17. It was also proposed that these cells can act like mechanosensor cells, transducing mechanical stress and guiding bone remodelling16,17. Nitric oxide, Wnt and cadherin-mediated signalling have been suggested as transduncing mechanisms, being activated following mechanical strain. However, the precise mechanical stimulus and response remain unclear17-19.\nOsteoclasts are responsible for bone reabsorption15,20, mobilizing Ca2+ and phosphate ions from the bone matrix, resorbing the bone in a multiple stage process4,21. These are highly specialized giant cells, multi-nucleated and highly migratory4,15,20, derived from the red bone marrow monocyte/macrophage lineage6,14. Capable of absorbing up to 200 000 pm3/day of bone ma-trix4, they also present numerous mitochondria, a well developed Golgi apparatus around the nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles and lysosomes. This cellular organization is the result of their great involvement in protein synthesis, in particular lysosomal enzymes15.\n1.3.3\tBone remodelling\nBone is a dynamic tissue, constantly being remodelled. In this process, represented in figure 1.2, old bone matrix is replaced by new matrix, whether due to bone growth or repair, adjustments to stress, or calcium regulation22,23. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts gather in a temporary assembly called BMU (basic multicellular unit) 17,22-24, regulated by mechanical forces, bone cell turnover, hormones (PTH (pituitary hormone), growth hormones, etc), cytokines and local factors17.\nThe bone remodelling process can be divided into four main phases: activation, resorption, reversal, and formation4,20,22,23,25 and the full process can take 3-6 months to be completed4.\nPTH\tJ IGF-I\t> TGF-B\tRANKL\tBMP\tDamage\t&amp; Osteoblasts\nx TNF-a\t\u25c4 IL-6 MCP-1\tRANK\tFGF\tOsteoclasts\t\u2022 Osteocyte\nFigure 1.2: Schematic view of bone tissue cells and bone remodelling.\nActivation phase\nThis stage involves the detection of an initiation signal, that can be a mechanical strain, damage, or factors released on the bone microenvironment20,22,25. In response to either the direct endocrine signals, or signals produced by osteocytes, osteoblasts react by recruiting osteoclast precursors to the remodelling site, through the release of a chemoattractant, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1)20.\nIn particular, IGF-I (insulin like growth factor 1), TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor a), IL-6 (interleukin 6), and PTH, activate bone lining osteoblasts, causing an increase in the surface expression of the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor k-B ligand) by these cells. On the other hand, responding to osteoclastogenic stimulus, osteoblastic cells present in the bone marrow secrete M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor). This induces the expression of RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor k-B) in pre-osteoclastic cells. The RANKL/RANK interaction leads to pre-osteoclast differentiation into multinucleated osteoclasts22,23.\nIn addition, damage to the bone or immobilization can result in osteocyte apoptosis, leading to increased osteoclastogenesis. This is due to a decrease in the levels of TGF-^ (transforming growth factor ), which is an osteoclastogenesis inhibitor secreted by osteocytes in basal conditions20.\nAnother osteoclast activation signal can be induced by hormones. PTH is an endocrine remodelling signal used to maintain calcium homoeostasis. This hormone is secreted by the parathyroid\nglands in response to low calcium levels in the serum20, and can stimulate both bone formation when secreted intermittently, and bone resorption when secreted continuously24.\nIn the bone, it activates a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of osteoblasts, that activates protein kinase A, protein kinase C and intracellular calcium signalling pathways. This osteoblast activation causes a wave of transcriptional responses that modulate the secretion of molecules responsible for the recruitment, differentiation, and activation of osteoclasts, establishing bone resorption20.\nResorption phase\nDuring this stage, osteoclasts adhere to the bone surface and start to dissolve the bone20,22. Cell anchorage is done via avfi3 integrin molecules, creating an isolated microenvironment underneath the cell20,25.\nThe organic and inorganic components of the bone are degraded through different processes. The inorganic component is mostly dissolved by decreasing the pH22, which is performed by pumping hydrogen ions into the sealed zone20,25. The organic components are degraded by lysosomal enzimes, MMP (matrix metallopeptidase) and cathepsin K, released by osteoclasts, that degrade the unmineralized osteoid lining at bone surface20,22. This exposes RGD (Arginyl-glycylaspartic acid) adhesion sites that facilitate further osteoclast attachment, enhancing bone re-sorption20. To avoid excessive bone resorption, osteoclasts suffer apoptosis after this stage.\nReversal phase\nThis stage marks the transition from osteoclast to osteoblast activity, with osteoblast precursors being recruited and differentiating25,26. In this phase, bone lining cells prepare the bone surface for the subsequent bone deposition by osteoblasts, cleaning it from bone matrix leftovers 20,24,25.They are also believed to be responsible for the signals that allow the transition from bone resorption to bone formation20,24.\nFormation phase\nThroughout the formation phase osteoblasts lay down bone until they have replaced the resorbed bone completely24 . The resorption phase releases a variety of growth factors stored in the bone matrix, such as BMP (bone morphogenic protein), FGF (fibroblast growth factor), and TGF-^, that are responsible for the recruitment of osteoblasts into the absorbed area22,25. Once osteoblasts are on site, and fully differentiated, both the organic and inorganic components are deposited, like collagen type I, which is the main organic component of the bone matrix, proteoglycans, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin20,25. The precise mechanism of bone mineralization is still unclear, although it is believed that alkaline phosphatase, nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase, and ANK (progressive ankylosis protein) take part in creating the optimum concentration of extracellular inorganic phosphate to allow for HA formation20.\nThe remodelling cycle is concluded when all reabsorbed bone is replaced. At the end of the cycle, osteoblasts either enter apoptosis, revert back to bone lining phenotype, or differentiate into osteocytes within the matrix20. Even though the bone remodelling process is one of the most reliable in the body, there are circumstances where it fails19. In fact, the pathologies inherent\nin bone disorders are almost always related to this cycle, influencing either bone formation or resorption4.\n1.4\tBone disorders\nBone disorders can be due to a variety of factors. Abnormal growth can cause gigantism or dwarfism, while abnormal collagen contents can lead to osteogenesis imperfecta. Mineral and vitamin deficiencies cause rickets, and bacterial infections can cause bone destruction, as is the case of osteomyelitis. Osteomalacia and osteoporosis are also responsible for bone damage, through decalcification6.\nAs already described, bone disorders arise primarily from derails in the bone remodelling process. Many of these metabolic diseases, with the exception of osteoporosis, present increased bone turnover, and are often associated with increased bone resorption due to high levels of serum PTH27. The most common metabolic bone diseases are acquired25, that is, derived from a disease or endocrine dysfunction, and include osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy (the skeletal changes of hyperparathyroidism and chronic renal failure), as well as Paget's disease25,28.\nOsteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease28, with an estimated 27.5 million people affected in the European Union29. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and structural bone deterioration, causing increased bone fragility and vulnerability to fractures25,27,28. It is most commonly due to an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. While both are heightened, they are altered with different intensities, resulting in higher bone resorption than bone formation, and leading to a loss in bone mass28. This disorder is more common in older populations, especially in women, due to the hormonal changes that they suffer with age. Nevertheless, excluding the hormonal effects of menopause, the disease has the same rate of progress in both genders28.\nRenal osteodystrophy\nRenal osteodystrophy includes a heterogeneous group of metabolic bone diseases derived from chronic kidney disease25,28. Among these are included osteomalacia25, deriving from vitamin D deficiency with profound defects in mineralization27; osteitis fibrosa25, a loss of bone mass derived from overproduction of PTH; osteopenia25, when the bone density is lower than normal, a pathological situation that can precede osteoporosis; and osteosclerosis25, a localized increase in bone density, that is associated with osteopetrosis. This type of disorders clearly reflect the importance of PTH and vitamin D on bone metabolism25,28, since most of bone related diseases derive from abnormalities in the metabolism of either or both of these components30.\nPaget's disease\nPaget's disease is a disorder of the bone remodelling process, involving the abnormal destruction of needed bone, and construction of unneeded bone25, leading to the production of structurally\nabnormal tissue27,28. Although the causes are not entirely understood, it is believed that it can be caused by a viral infection during childhood, and several genetic mutations have also been identified on patients with the disease25,28.\nIt is clear that there is a need for new therapies to treat bone defects, either caused by disease or trauma.\n1.5\tBone grafts\nAs already described, bone presents self-regeneration and remodelling. However, this is a limited ability. There are certain traumas that the organism is unable to heal without surgical intervention, called critically sized osseous defects31. In such cases, bone grafts are usually used for enhancing the formation of new bone. The capacity of bone grafts to regenerate tissue is measured according to their osteogenic, osteoconductive and osteoinductive potential32. An osteogenic graft is capable of inducing the maturation of osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts, facilitating the formation of bone tissue. Osteoconduction is related with the formation of bone on a surface, in particular, the ability of the graft to support the bone growth in a 3D (3 dimensional) defect. Finally, osteoinduction refers to the recruitment and maturation of osteoprogenitor cells into the defect site31.\nThese bone grafts are divided into three main categories: autografts, allografts and xenografts32.\nAutografts\nAutografts are considered the gold-standard of bone grafting33,34, and are the basis to which all of the other methods are compared. They consist of transplanting bone tissue from a donor to the lesion site, within the same patient31,32. They usually present high success rates31, with excellent biological properties: the collected bone is rich in osteogenic cells, osteoconductive bone matrix and growth factors 32,33,35. In addition, there is no risk of rejection or disease transmission, since only tissue from the patient's own body is used35.\nHowever, the harvesting of bone from a different site can cause pain32,33, infection, scarring32, blood loss, and donor site morbidity32-34. Since the graft is being taken from the patient, there is also limited tissue availability33. In addition, there is no guaranty that the cellular components survive transplantation33, and questions have been raised about the osteoinductivity of these grafts, since the uncertain quantities of certain growth factors on autografts can cause insufficient tissue regeneration 35 .\nAllografts\nAllografts are used as an alternative to autografts, and are obtained from human donors or ca-davers31,34. Even though these types of bone grafts eliminate the need for a donor site, and the supply limitations, they lack the osteoinductive capacity of autografts31,33. They also present the risk of viral disease transmission and immunogenicity31-34. The processing techniques used to lower these risks also decrease the mechanical resistance of the grafts, and usually eliminate the cellular phase of the bone tissue33.\nXenografts\nAlso worth mentioning are xenografts, bone grafts obtained from other species. Since the potential for immune rejection and disease transmission is much higher from animal bone than from human bone, these types of bone grafts are processed through more intensive treatments,34, which further limits the biologic and mechanical properties of these materials.\nDue to all the aforementioned limitations, bone graft substitutes have been the focus of intense research in the area of Bone Tissue Engineering, with has as main objective to create bone scaffolds that mimick the microenvironment of the bone32.\n1.6\tTissue engineering\nTissue engineering emerges as \u201can interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function\u201d2. In particular, bone tissue engineering tries to create grafts with the capacity to induce the restoration of bone structure and functions34,36, favouring regeneration over replacement2, and are usually composed of an ECM-mimicking structure (scaffold), cells, and growth factors3,34,37.\nThe ideal tissue engineered construct should be able to completely replace autologous bone grafts3. However, even when the constructs cannot fully replace these grafts, they can be added to the autologous graft to increase its volume, diminishing the amount of bone needed3. Bone tissue engineering tries to recreate the appropriate environment for the regeneration through the extensive use of 3D scaffolds38. Nonetheless, the scaffolds currently generated are limited by the current manufacturing techniques, and are based on a randomly distribution of cells, matrix, and bioactive molecules37. As such, the mimicking of both functional and biological complexity is seen as the current challenge to achieve full tissue regeneration 37.\n1.6.1\t3D scaffolds\nFundamentally, scaffolds are templates for tissue regeneration38, capable of delivering cells and growth factors to a damaged tissue, while providing mechanical support during the regeneration phase37. Scaffolds have been created through a variety of techniques using different biomaterials that present certain key qualities for a successful regeneration38: biocompatibility3,36,38,39, biodegradability3,36,38-40, osteoconductivity3,36,39, osteoinductivity3,36,39, appropriate mechanical properties3,36,38,39, adequate structure3,36,38,39, and ease of manufacture38,41.\n\u2022\tBiocompatibility\nThis is considered to be one of the most important properties of bone scaffolds3. Neither the scaffold, nor any of its components and by-products, can be toxic or cause any adverse response in the host3. In addition, it must allow for normal cell adhesion, functioning, and proliferation38.\n\u2022\tBiodegradability\nA bone scaffold is designed to serve as a temporary matrix, and eventually be replaced with bone tissue. As such, it must degrade within the body at the same rate of new tissue formation40. To accomplish this, a controlled inflammatory response must occur, with an affluence of cells such as macrophages38. It follows that this property must be adjusted\nnot only to the local of implantation of the scaffold39, but also taking into account the age of the patient who receives it38.\n\u2022\tOsteoconductivity\nFor a scaffold to be able to improve the regeneration of a damaged bone tissue, cells must be able to migrate, adhere, proliferate, and deposit new bone matrix3,39.\n\u2022\tOsteoinductivity\nThe scaffold should also be able to induce the formation of new bone, as well as cell differentiation36. While this characteristic is usually connected to growth factors, recent studies have shown that bone induction can derive from the physical structure of the scaffold as well3.\n\u2022\tAppropriate mechanical properties\nIn order to provide adequate mechanical support, a bone scaffold must have mechanic properties similar to the host bone36,38,39. The Young's Module of bone ranges from 0.10.2GPa of cancellous bone, to 15-20GPa in cortical bone. The compressive strength also presents very different ranges: 2-20MPa for cancellous bone, and 100-200MPa for cortical bone39. Since these properties vary largely according to the bone type and location, scaffolds must be tailored to their specific application, taking into account the loads they will have to bear once implanted.\n\u2022\tAdequate structure\nThe structure of the scaffold is closely connected to its mechanical properties, and structural modifications can drastically affect the mechanical resistance. However, it also has profound effects on the biological properties. The porosity of a scaffold increases the available area for cell growth and attachment3,38. In addition, interconnected porosity allows the diffusion of essential nutrients and oxygen3,38,39, as well as waste products38. To facilitate bone ingrowth, scaffolds must possess pores with a minimum of 100 pm in diameter39, with the ideal range between 200 to 300 pm39. Recent studies have shown that a combination of micro and macro porosities can perform better than macro-porous scaffolds39. The presence of micropores on a structure greatly increases the surface area for cell adhesion, and can also contribute for a greater concentration of calcium and phosphate ions, by providing a sheltered environment within the scaffolds, thus improving bone regeneration42.\n\u2022\tAcceptable manufacturing technology\nUltimately, for a scaffold to be able to have any clinical impact and viability, it must be cost effective and its production scalable38,41. Whether the scaffold needs in-vitro culture before implantation, how easy it is to handle, its storage needs, as well as the sterilization methods, are all factors that can affect the clinical viability of a scaffold38.\n1.6.1.1\tBiomaterials for scaffold production\nBiomaterial is currently defined by the European Society for Biomaterials as a \u201cmaterial intended to interact with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body\u201d38. These types of materials have suffered a great evolution since their inception, spanning already four generations43.\nThe first biomaterials were biologically inert, and the main goal was simply to replicate the physical properties of the native tissue with minimal toxic effects43,44. When the properties of\nthese materials proved to be insufficient, and in conjunction with a better understanding of the foreign body response, the research focus changed towards the creation of a biological response, with bioactive materials. This marked the rising of the second generation of biomaterials, that elicited not only a biological response, but also presented a controllable resorption within the body43,44. Osteoconductive implants became routine, with the use of synthetic HA and bioactive glasses on porous implants and coatings. Also, the creation of structures that facilitated tissue ingrowth and 3D interlocking with the surrounding tissue contributed to the formation of a mechanically strong interface43. The advances in scientific knowledge, mainly in molecular biology and proteomics, allowed the design of biomaterials capable of creating specific cellular responses, giving origin to the third generation of biomaterials43. Moreover, these materials are being modified with biological components obtained from the ECM, that are specifically recognized by cells seeded on them44. Finally, the fourth generation of biomaterials combines the properties of all previous generations, while trying to mimic the native tissue: biomimetic materials. These materials try to recreate the complexity of the physiological environments43,44, with some of them being already capable of modulating genetic activation and expression after implantation44, as well as respond to variations in temperature, pH and ionic force45-47.\nIt is thus clear that the choice of materials used in the production of scaffolds for bone regeneration is a key aspect in their performance. A variety of biomaterials is used for bone scaffold manufacturing, although they usually fall within four main categories: ceramic, polymeric, metallic, or composite scaffolds32,39.\nCeramics\nThe ceramics used in bone tissue engineering are commonly composed of calcium and phos-phate3. Ceramic scaffolds can be divided into bioinert or bioactive scaffolds, with the latter further divided into resorbable and non-resorbable scaffolds32. Bioactivity refers to the ability of the scaffold to modify its surface structure and establish connections with the surrounding bone when implanted41.\nThe most used ceramics are HA and ^-TCP (beta tricalcium phosphate), which closely resemble the mineral phase of the bone, and are therefore highly biocompatible, bioactive and osteocon-ductive38,41,48. However, these materials are different when it comes to their degradation rates. While ^-TCP presents an almost ideal biodegradability in vivo, HA shows almost no biodegradation3,41,49. In addition, the ability of /3-TCP to bond directly to tissue, and regenerate bone without intermediate tissue, as well as proper bio-resorption rate, have made it one of the most used ceramics in tissue engineering3,32,39,43,49.\nAlso, in spite of its great compressive strength, which is usually equal or greater than the native bone tissue31, ceramics tend to present a hard and brittle nature31,38,40,43. In addition, it can be difficult to process them into highly porous structures, which further limits their use in scaffold production40. The mechanical properties of native bone results from the combination of both its organic and inorganic phases. When ceramics are used alone they have limited properties for load-bearing applications41.\nPolymers\nPolymers can either have a natural origin, such as collagen36,50, starch34, silk34, or alginate34, or they can be synthesized31,41, as PLA (polylactic acid)36,38,39, PCL (polycaprolactone)39,51, or\nPGA (polyglicolic acid) 36,38,39.\nSince some natural polymers actually are structural constituents of tissues, these materials present greater biocompatibility and biodegradability50. However, they usually present lower mechanical resistance and faster degradation rates, which limits their use in tissue engineer-ing50. Synthetic polymers are highly versatile31,50, with controlled properties, although they have a lack of bioactivity. Furthermore, the degradation products of these polymers can sometimes present negative effects on the regeneration process31.\nAlginate, which was the polymer used in this study for scaffolds production, is a natural polysac-charid derived from brown seaweeds43,52. Composed of 1,4-linked ^-D-mannuronic acid (M) and a-L-guluronic acid (G) residues, this polymer can form stable hydrogels cross-linked with divalent cations52,53. This cross-linking happens between two G blocks of adjacent polymer chains, through interaction with the carboxylic groups and, as a consequence, the stiffness of the gel produced is directly related to the M/G ratio of the polymer and quantity of free divalent cations in solution53,54.\nFigure 1.3: Sodium alginate chemical structure. (Adapted from Narayanan et al.55)\nAlginate is extremely versatile, easily forming gels, fibers, foams, and nanoparticles, at physiological conditions53, while being biocompatible, and non-immunogenic54. Still, the dissolution rates of ionically cross-linked alginates cannot be perfectly controlled, and it presents slow degradation kinetics in vivo.\nMetals\nTitanium and tantalum feature among the most common used metals for scaffold production. While these materials have great compressive strength and fatigue resistance, they are not biodegradable. In addition, they do not allow the incorporation of biomolecules39, requiring coatings and surface treatments to immobilize biologically active peptides56. The release of toxic metallic ions is also a concern32,39.\nComposites\nComposite materials have in their constitution two or more distinct materials, for example ceramics and polymers39,57. These combinations try to overcome the drawbacks of the brittleness of ceramic scaffolds by adding a polymer, thats is inherently more flexible50.\nThe current challenge in tissue engineering is to mimic the natural structure of living tissue38. Until now, the most used methods of scaffold production included solvent casting58,59, phase inversion60,61, fiber bonding62,63, melting64,65 and freeze drying66,67. However, these methods present severe disadvantages, such as the use of toxic solvents, the inability to create large structures with suitable mechanical properties or lack of structure and porosity control1.\nThe advances in computer technology allowed the development of rapid prototyping techniques for tissue engineering applications. These enable the manufacturing of highly reproducible 3D scaffolds68, with increased complexity and control, from a CAD (computer assisted design) model57. In addition, the model used for scaffold production can be derived from medical data, and thus be tailored specifically for a particular damaged tissue with high anatomic accu-racy57,69,70.\nThe most common rapid prototyping techniques in use are 3D printing, FDM (fused deposition modelling) and 3D plotting1,71.\n3D printing uses a liquid binder dispensed onto thin layers of powder, following the objects profile, creating a final structure in a layer-by-layer assembly1,72. This approach is limited by the binder used, since many of the available binders are toxic, and the structures cannot have closed surfaces, otherwise unbounded powder would accumulate inside73.\nFDM employs the deposition of a thermoplastic filament on a platform, by melting extrusion, also in a layer-by-layer fashion, the stacking of layers creating the final structure1. Given the temperatures used for the polymer extrusion this technique does not allow for the incorporation of cells nor biomolecules on the interior of the material used74.\nFinally, in 3D plotting a hydrogel is dispensed through a syringe onto a platform 1. This deposition can be achieved by pneumatic action, screw-driven, or piston action, with the latter providing the best flow control. This robotic deposition has resolutions in the order of 200 pm, with high fabrication speeds, and is one of the most promising technologies37.\nIn this work a Fab@Home 3D plotter was used for scaffold production (figure 1.4). This model was developed by Malone and Lipson75, and was previously used for tissue engineering applica-tions76,77.\nFigure 1.4: Image of a Fab@Home plotter used to produce the scaffolds used in this study\n1.6.2.1\tFab@Home 3D plotter for scaffold production\nAs described above, the 3D plotting technology has great advantages over other methods, mainly the possibility of using viscous solutions for scaffold production at RT (room temperature). The viscosity of the solution used has a great effect on the accuracy and resolution of the equipment. In addition, several settings should be taken into account before a scaffold can be produced. The dispensing pressure, the nozzle diameter, the depositon rate, and the printspeed, depend on the solution used, as well as the CAD model, and must be adjusted accordingly78.\nIn brief, the CAD model is designed or scanned, and converted to STL (Standard Tessellation Language) format. This is then loaded onto the Fab@Home software, that slices the model into several layers. With the syringe loaded with the solution and the equipment properly configured, the scaffold is deposited layer-by-layer onto the plotter platform75,78.\n1.7\tAims\nAdditive manufacturing of /3-TCP/Alginate composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering\n\u2022\tOptimization of the design of the 3D structure\n\u2022\tOptimization of the viscosity of the solution\n\u2022\tStudy the influence of ^-TCP content on the scaffolds properties\n\u2022\tStudy the influence of a ^-TCP binding agent on the scaffolds properties\n\u2022\tEvaluate the mechanical, physicochemical and biological properties of the produced scaffolds\nChapter 2\nMaterials and Methods\n2.1\tMaterials\nAmphotericin B, BSA (bovine serum albumin), cacodylate buffer (Mw=214.03 g/mol), calcium chloride (Mw=110.98 g/mol), DMEM-F12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium: nutrient mixture F12), EtOH (ethanol), EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, L-glutamine, penicillin G, PBS (phosphate buffer saline), PVA (poly(vinyl) alcohol) (Mw=31 000 g/mol), sodium alginate (Mw=120 kDa to 190 kDa), streptomycin, trypan blue and trypsin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal). 3-TCP powder (Mw=310.20 g/mol) was obtained from Pancreac\u00ae (Barcelona, Spain). Sodium hydroxide was acquired from Pronalab (Barcelona, Spain).\nMTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) reagent, inner salt was purchased from Promega (Madison, USA). FBS (Fetal bovine serum) was purchased from Biochrom AG (Berlin, Germany). Human osteoblast cells (CRL-11372) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (VA, USA). 96-well plates were acquired from Orange Scientific (Braine LAlleud, Belgium). Tris Base was obtained from Fischer Scientific (Portugal).\n2.2\tMethods\n2.2.1\tRapid Prototyping of beta tricalcium phosphate/Alginate composite scaffolds\nTo produce the scaffolds herein described an additive manufacturing method was used. In particular, a Fab@Home plotter was used, for the creation of well defined, highly reproducible 3D structures75. This type of system deposits a highly viscous solution in a controlled manner, in this case a 3-TCP/alginate composite.\nFor this study, six types of scaffolds were produced, using different ratios of 3-TCP/alginate, and PVA.\nBriefly, a 1% (w/v) PVA solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer in double deionized and filtered water (obtained using a Milli-Q Advantage A10 ultrapure Water Purification System; resistivity=18.2MQ/cm at 25 \u00b0C), with overnight agitation. Then, a 15% (w/v) alginate solution was prepared, dissolving the alginate in either water or in the PVA solution. This solution was then homogenized in a X10/25 ultraturrax (Ystral, Germany) for 30 minutes. Finally, 3-TCP powder was added to the solution according to the specific ratios studied (table 2.1), and the solution was again homogenized.\nFollowing, a 5% CaCl2 solution was added to the composite solution, following a 0.14:1 (% v/v) ratio of CaCl2 to alginate. In this step, alginate goes through a ionic crosslinking process, which allows for the increased viscosity of the solution through the formation of a hydrogel53. This\nTable 2.1: Chemical composition of the produced scaffolds\nScaffolds\t\u00a3-TCP\tAlginate\tPVA\n60/40\t60\t40\tNo\n70/30\t70\t30\tNo\n80/20\t80\t20\tNo\n60/40/PVA\t60\t40\tYes\n70/30/PVA\t70\t30\tYes\n80/20/PVA\t80\t20\tYes\nincrease in the viscosity is essential for the later deposition process.\nThe Fab@Home model reproduces a computer designed 3D model, in a layer-by-layer process. As such, the model of the scaffold was produced in OpenSCAD software (version 2014.3, \u00a920092014 Marius Kintel and Clifford Wolf), and then exported to STL format. Afterwards, the solution was filled into a 10 cm3 disposable syringe barrel, and the scaffolds plotted through a 22G polypropylene tapered nozzle. Following, the scaffolds were maintained in a 5% CaCl2 bath for 24 hours, for full crosslinking, after which they were left to dry at RT for 24 hours. Finally, the scaffolds were freeze-dried for 24 hours.\n2.2.2\tPhysicochemical and morphological characterization of the scaffolds\n2.2.2.1\tScanning Electron Microscopy analysis\nSEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) micrographs were acquired in order to characterize the morphology, porosity and surface of the scaffolds. The samples were mounted onto aluminium stubs with Araldite glue, and sputter-coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. The SEM images where then captured with variable magnifications, at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, using a Hitachi S-3400N Scanning Electron Microscope.\n2.2.2.2\tFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis\nTo measure the physicochemical characteristics of the scaffolds, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) was used. The FTIR spectra obtained for the samples are the average of 128 scans, between 400 and 4000 cm \\ with a spectral resolution of 4 cm \u2019. All the samples were crushed to a powder, mounted on a diamond window, and the spectra recorded with a Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All the components of the scaffold were also analysed in pure state for comparison with the samples79.\n2.2.2.3\tX-Ray Diffraction analysis\nXRD (X-Ray diffraction) measurements were performed in order to evaluate the phases and crystallinity of the ceramic component of the scaffolds after their production.\nAll samples were mounted in silica supports, and the data recorded over a range of 5\u00b0to 90\u00b020 degrees, with continuous scans of 1 \u00b0/min, using a copper ray tube operated at 30 kV and 20 mA70,77.\n2.2.2.4\tEnergy Dispersive Spectroscopic analysis\nEDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) was used for elemental characterization of the various scaffolds. The samples were placed on aluminium stubs, air-dried at RT, and analysed in a\nXFlash Detector 5010(Bruker Nano).\n2.2.3\tMechanical characterization of the scaffolds\nCompression assays were performed in order to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of the scaffolds. The dimensions of the final scaffolds were measured and introduced into a Zwick\u00ae 1435 Material Pufung (Ulm, Germany). The assays were performed using a crosshead speed of 3 mm/min and a load cell of 5 kN. Five specimens of each sample were used for each assay. The compressive strength of each scaffold was calculated according to equation (2.1)80.\nF w * l\nCs =\n(2.1)\nWhere F is the load at the time of fracture, and w and l represent the width and length of the scaffold, respectively.\nThe Young Modulus was calculated using the values from the equation (2.1), and applying equation 2.2.\nCs\nHd\n(2.2)\n\nWhere Hd stands for the height deformation at maximum load, and Cs is the scaffold tensile strength. Average values and standard deviations (s.d.) were determined for each sample (n=5).\n2.2.4\tSwelling studies\nThe swelling capacity of the scaffolds was determined following a method adapted from Valente et al.52. Samples from each scaffold were placed in eppendorfs containing 5 mL of Tris buffer (pH=7,4), at 37 \u00b0C. The samples were then retrieved from the solution at predetermined intervals, and weighted, after removing the excess of Tris with filter paper. After this process, the samples were re-immersed in buffer solution. Three samples of each scaffold were used and the swelling ratio was evaluated using equation (2.3).\nWt - W0\nSwelling ratio (%) = \u2014\" * 100 (2.3)\nWhere Wt is the final weight of the scaffolds, and W0 their initial weight.\n2.2.5\tPorosity evaluation\nTo determine the microporosity of the different scaffolds a liquid displacement method was adapted from Torres et al.80. In brief, scaffolds were weighted, immersed in absolute EtOH for 48 hours, and weighted again. EtOH was chosen for its ability to penetrate throughout the scaffolds without shrinking nor swelling the matrix81 . The porosity was then calculated by the amount of EtOH absorbed, through equation (2.4):\nPorosity (%) = -\u2014Ww\tWd-----* 100 (2.4)\nDethanol * Vscaffold\nWhere Ww and Wd are the wet and dry weights of the scaffolds, respectively, Dethanol represents the density of EtOH at RT and Vscaffold the volume of the wet scaffold.\n2.2.6\tCharacterization of the degradation profile of the scaffolds\nThe degradation of the composite scaffolds was investigated through a method adapted from Jeong et al.82 and Freed et al.83. In brief, scaffolds were placed in 24 well plates, fully immersed in DMEM-F12, at 37 \u00b0C. At predetermined intervals the samples were removed, completely dried and weighted. The degradation percentage at each point was calculated through equation (2.5):\nW: - Wt\nWeight Loss (%) = (1---W) * 100 (2.5)\nWhere Wi corresponds to the initial weight of the sample and Wt to the weight of the sample at time t.\n2.2.7\tContact Angle Measurements\nContact angle measurements were performed using the sessile drop technique, adapted from Diogo et al.77, using water as reference fluid. Drops were placed at different points on the surface of the scaffolds, and the data was acquired usind a Data Physics Contact Angle System OCAH 200, operated in static mode at RT.\n2.2.8\tBiological characterization of the scaffolds\n2.2.8.1\tCell culture in the presence of the scaffolds\nHuman osteoblasts (CRL-11372) were cultured in DMEM-F12, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, streptomycin (100 pg/mL) and gentamicin (100 pg/mL) in 75 cm2 T-flasks. Cells were maintained in a humidified environment at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO2, until confluence was attained. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized with 0.18% trypsin (1:250), and 5 mM EDTA, centrifuged at 300 RCF, for 5 min, and the pellet resuspended in 5 mL of complete culture medium. Cellular density was then determined using a Neubauer chamber and trypan blue.\nPrior to cell seeding, the scaffolds were cut into pieces with appropriate sizes and placed into 96-well plates for sterilization (n=5). This was achieved by subjecting the scaffolds to UV (ultraviolet) light for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were seeded at a density of 10x10 3 cells per well, for cell viability and proliferation evaluation. The culture medium was replaced every two days until the end of the assay.\n2.2.8.2\tEvaluation of cell viability and proliferation in the presence of the scaffolds\nCell viability was determined using an MTS assay, at 4 and 7 days after seeding. The metabolic activity of the cells was assessed by quantifying the metabolic conversion of MTS to formazan. Briefly, the medium in each well was replaced with a mixture of 100 pL of fresh culture medium\ncontaining 20 pL of MTS/PMS (phenazine methosulfate) reagent solution. The cells were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Following the incubation period, 80 pL of the supernatant were transfered into a 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Anthos 2020, Biochrom). Cells cultured without materials were used as negative control (K-) and cells cultured with EtOH (96%) were used as positive control (K+).\n2.2.8.3\tScanning Electron Microscopy analysis\nIn order to evaluate the morphology and topography of the scaffolds as well as the cellular behaviour in their presence, SEM was performed according to the method adapted from Lee and Chow84. Briefly, the samples were washed at RT with cacodylate buffer solution, then fixed for 30 minutes in 2.5%(v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate solution. The samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for 2 min and then freeze-dried for 2 hours.\nFor SEM analysis, the samples were mounted onto aluminium stubs with Araldite glue, and sputter-coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. The SEM images were captured at variable magnifications, with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, using a Hitachi S-3400N Scanning Electron Microscope.\n2.2.9\tStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis of the obtained results for the different groups of scaffolds, and the various conditions, was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the Newman-Keuls post hoc test. The statistical test was used for comparison of the mean and the differences between groups. A p value less than 0.05 (p<0.05) was considered statistically significant.\nChapter 3\nResults and Discussion\n3.1\tMorphological characterization of the scaffolds\nAs previously described, biodegradable scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration must fulfill certain requirements, such as good biocompatibility and suitable structure. They must also provide mechanical support during the regeneration phase, as well as adequate physicochemical environment for cell proliferation.\nSince most types of materials present certain disadvantages when used alone, in this work composite materials were used for scaffold development. In particular, a polymer and ceramic composite was chosen, mimicking the natural bone matrix. Thus, this study describes the development, optimization and production of scaffolds aimed for bone tissue regeneration, composed of /3-TCP and alginate. Figure 3.1 presents the CAD model used, as well as the printed scaffold by rapid prototyping. The designed model is a 13 mm x 13 mm x 13 mm cube, with porous structure.\nFigure 3.1: Images of the CAD model used (left) and of the final printed model (right)\nHerein, alginate was chosen for its biocompatibility, and ability to act as temporary ECM. In addition, the ability to control the degradation rate of this polymer is a great advantage for the tailoring of the properties of the scaffold53,54. On the other hand, ^-TCP was chosen for its resemblance with the natural ceramic component of bone tissue, and consequently, its increased biocompatibility and osteoconductivity38,41,48, allied to its enhanced mechanical resistance. Furthermore, the combination of these materials has already been shown to improve cell adhesion and proliferation, with the potential to support cell growth and differentiation before implantation77,85.\nMacroscopic images of the produced scaffolds were acquired, to assess their morphology (figure 3.2).\nFigure 3.2: Macroscopic images of the different produced scaffolds\nIt is possible to observe that the 3-TCP content had a direct effect on the scaffolds structure, namely on the scaffolds dimensions. It was previously described that alginate gels and scaffolds present shrinkage during air drying86. Rassis et al.87 have related that the presence of solid fillers in an alginate solution has a direct effect on the volume loss after drying. The compression of the polymeric matrix leads to the compression of the 3-TCP particles against each other. In effect, the scaffolds containing the highest percentage of 3-TCP were capable of maintaining their dimensions showing a lower amount of shrinkage, since the amount of incompressible ceramic particles limits the shrinking that the scaffolds can suffer. Nonetheless, all the formulations maintained their shape, with a well defined structure and design.\nFollowing, SEM images were acquired, to characterize the scaffolds surface morphology (Figure\n3.3).\nFigure 3.3: SEM images showing the morphology of the scaffolds at different magnifications\nIn figure 3.3 it is possible to observe that all the scaffolds presented similar surface characteristics, with high roughness and irregularities. It has been previously described that the cellular morphology, adhesion and proliferation are directly affected by the scaffolds surface characteristics. In particular, human osteoblasts present increased metabolism, and ECM production, when in contact with rough surfaces. This effect is caused by an increased contact surface, directly related to the increased adhesion points on irregular surfaces88.\n3.2.1\tFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic analysis\nThe FTIR spectra of the raw materials and of the produced scaffolds, are present in figure 3.4.\n1000\t2000\t3000\t4000\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 3.4: FTIR analysis of the powders and 3D scaffolds.\nThe ^-TCP spectrum presents a major peak at 1020cm 1 (I), characteristic of a P=O stretch vibration, revealing the presence of the inorganic phosphate components of /3-TCP70. This peak is also present on the spectra of the produced scaffolds, with an intensity that is proportional to the ceramic content.\nThe FTIR spectrum of sodium alginate powder presented two major peaks at 1400 and 1600 cm=1\n(II)\t, corresponding to the C=O stretching of the carboxylate group89. In addition, a stretching vibration correspondent to the O=H bonds of alginate appeared in the range 3000 -3600 cm=1\n(III)\t90. These peaks were also present in the spectra of the different scaffolds, without perceptible variations among the different formulations.\nIn the PVA spectrum, all major peaks are related to the hydroxyl and acetate groups. In particular, a large band is present between 3550 and 3200 cm=1, representative of a O=H stretching from hydrogen bonds (III), and a vibrational band between 2840and 3000cm=1 (*), that belongs to a C=H stretching from alkyl groups. In addition, the peaks at 1735 -1750cm=1 (**) are\nrelative to a C=O and C-O stretches, from the acetate group of PVA91. However, the characteristic peaks of PVA are not observed in the other spectra since low concentrations were used for scaffold\u2019s production77.\n3.2.2\tX-ray diffraction analysis\nTo confirm the crystalline phases of ^-TCP an XRD analysis was performed. The XRD patterns of both the ^-TCP powder and the produced scaffolds, are present in figure 3.5.\nIt can be observed that the ^-TCP spectra presents two intense peaks located at 20=25\u00b0-32\u00b0, characteristic of this material49. These peaks demonstrate the successful incorporation of the ceramic component in the scaffolds, and the lack of any amorphous phases show that the crystalline structure was not affected during the production steps70.\nFigure 3.5: XRD spectra of j8-TCP and of the produced scaffolds\n3.2.3\tEnergy dispersive spectroscopic analysis\nAn elemental analysis of the scaffolds was performed to characterize the chemical composition of the scaffolds. In figure 3.6 it is possible to observe that all the scaffolds have a high percentage of carbon and oxygen, derived mainly from the alginate. In fact, the carbon content of the scaffolds rises with the increasing amount of alginate.\nFigure 3.6: EDS analysis of the produced scaffolds\nThe results of this analysis show an increase in phosphate and calcium ions, with increasing ceramic content of the scaffold. Such results were expected, since these are the main components of /3-TCP. As such, the EDS analysis is in agreement with the scaffolds composition.\n3.2.4\tMechanical characterization of the scaffolds\nThe mechanical behaviour of the scaffolds was analysed through the resistance to compression and Young's modulus, present in figure 3.7.\n\n\u25a0icMc-ic\nFigure 3.7: Mechanical characterisation of the scaffolds\nFrom figure 3.7 it is possible to observe that the 60/40 scaffolds presented the highest compression strength when compared to the other scaffolds. It was previously described that an increased ceramic content leads to lower mechanical resistance92,93, as was observed. Furthermore, in a biphasic solution, the polymeric component acts as a binder for the ceramic\nparticles. In the particular case of hydrogels, the gelation process creates a three-dimensional matrix, yielding a bone like structure by trapping the ceramic particles94. The composition of the 60/40 scaffolds closely resembles the native bone composition, mimicking the fine balance of strength and elasticity present in bone tissue. The high 3-TCP content in the 70/30 and 80/20 scaffolds lead to an increased brittleness and fragility, characteristic of pure ceramic scaffolds93.\nComparing with the natural bone, the scaffolds with the lowest mechanical resistance, 80/20, presented a compressive strength similar to that of cortical bone, at about 20 MPa. Furthermore, the 60/40 scaffolds showed more than half the resistance of cortical bone, proving that this type of scaffolds can achieve more than adequate mechanical stability for non load bearing sites.\nWe can also note that the addition of PVA to the scaffolds compositions lowered their mechanical resistance, in particular for the 60/40 scaffolds. Islam and Karim95 have previously reported that alginate presents better mechanical properties than PVA, as was also confirmed here.\nThe Young modulus analysis showed that the scaffolds with lowest ceramic content present the highest modulus. In addition, it was also shown that PVA has a negative effect on the scaffolds mechanical properties, decreasing the Young modulus. Comparing with the natural bone, all the scaffolds surpassed the Young Modulus of cancellous bone. However, they are still one order of magnitude lower than the modulus for cortical bone, demonstrating the difficulty of perfectly mimicking the mechanical structure of such a complex tissue.\nIn short, the scaffolds with the 60/40 formulation presented the best mechanical properties, both for compression strength, and for Young Modulus, surpassing the mechanical properties of trabecular bone.\n3.2.5\tSwelling studies\nThe swellings profiles obtained for the scaffolds are presented in figure 3.8. It is possible to observe that all the scaffolds presented a rapid swelling in the first minutes and stabilized after about 10 hours of immersion.\nFigure 3.8: Swelling profile of the scaffolds\nValente et al. have previously reported that the polymer network of alginate is capable of absorbing large quantities of water, filling its void regions52. This effect was confirmed in the\nresults obtained in this study, where the scaffolds containing higher amounts of 3-TCP, and thus less void regions, presented a lower swelling ratio.\nThe results also show that the scaffolds containing PVA present a slightly higher swelling behaviour. This is due to the ability of PVA to absorb water, increasing the swelling capacity of the scaffold96.\n3.2.6\tPorosity evaluation\nFigure 3.9 shows that the scaffolds with highest 3-TCP content present the highest porosity values (> 10% porosity). During the drying process the scaffolds suffer shrinking, which is responsible for the compression of the polymer matrix. In this stage, the scaffolds with high ceramic content present more incompressible particles, thus limiting the amount of shrinkage that they can suffer, and consequently showing increased porosity70,77 .\nIn addition, the presence of PVA on the scaffold\u2019s composition can hinder the compaction effect of alginate, leading to a decrease in scaffold\u2019s density, and thus increased their porosity.\nThese results are in agreement with the mechanical resistance data. Porosity and density are inversely proportional. Density is closely related to the mechanical resistance of a scaffold. Therefore, the most resistant scaffolds should also be the denser, as can be observed in figure 3.9.\n\nI-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1\nFigure 3.9: Porosity evaluation of the scaffolds\nNevertheless, the obtained scaffolds present microporosities that are far from being ideal for a good cell migration, as well as nutrients and oxygen flow. However, this lack of microporosity is balanced by a regular and sufficient macroporosity, as can be seen in figure 3.3.\n3.2.7\tCharacterization of the degradation profile of the produced scaffolds\nThe degradation profile of the produced scaffolds is presented in figure 3.10.\nDays\nFigure 3.10: Degradation profile of the scaffolds\nIn vivo, alginate only depolymerises by spontaneous alkaline ^-elimination of its glycosidic linkages, due to a lack of enzymes capable of degrading this compound in humans. However, it can suffer disintegration by gradual exchange of calcium ions with sodium, reversing the gelling process53. The results obtained revealed that the scaffolds have a degradation profile dependent on the relative alginate content of the scaffolds, with the scaffolds containing a higher percentage of the polymer enduring a greater loss of mass. Nonetheless, none of the scaffolds lost more than 45% of its mass, and all stabilized after 4 days. In addition, Weinand et al. have previously reported that cells can disperse throughout the structure of similar scaffolds within 7 days, and deposit new bone tissue97. These results show that the produced scaffolds present a degradation rate suitable for bone tissue regeneration.\n3.2.8\tContact angle measurements\nThe contact angle results are represented in figure 3.11.\n\nI-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1\nI-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1\nI-----------------------------------------1\nFigure 3.11: Contact angle of the produced scaffolds\nIt is possible to observe that all the scaffolds present a moderate to highly hydrophilic surface, with contact angles below 70. Furthermore, they present a clear increase in the hydrophilic character when the ^-TCP content of the scaffolds is higher, as previously described by Diogo et al. and Hu et al., benefiting cell attachment and growth77,98. In addition, PVA also decreased the hydrophilicity of the scaffolds, increasing the contact angle of all compositions.\n3.2.9\tAnalysis of the scaffolds biological properties\n3.2.9.1 Characterization of the cytotoxic profile of the scaffolds\nIn vitro studies where performed to elucidate about the cytotoxicity of the scaffolds. Human osteoblastic cells were cultured in contact with the scaffolds for up to 7 days, and their viability assessed at 4, and 7 days. The optical images acquired at the mentioned time points after cell seeding demonstrated that they were able to adhere and proliferate in the presence of the composite scaffolds (Figure 3.12), in a comparable rate to that of the negative control. In the positive control it is possible to observe the cells in their typical spherical shape which is characteristic of dead cells.\nFigure 3.12: Macroscopic images of human osteoblasts in the presence of the scaffolds\nTo further characterize the cytotoxic profile of the scaffolds, and to evaluate the cellular adhesion on their surface, SEM images were acquired (figure 3.13).\nFigure 3.3 demonstrated that the scaffolds presented high roughness and irregularities, creating possible attachment points for the cells. In fact, it is possible to observe that the cells were able to adhere to the surface of the material after 24 h of being seeded. Moreover, after 7 days,\nmost cells had spread throughout the entire scaffold\u2019s surface, creating a cell layer around the scaffold, demonstrating that all the scaffolds presented a suitable surface for cell adhesion and proliferation.\nFigure 3.13: SEM images of osteoblasts morphology in the presence of the scaffolds\nIn figure 3.14 it is presented the results obtained in the MTS assay.\n\u25a0 Day 4\nO Day 7\nFigure 3.14: Evaluation of human osteoblast cell viability cultured in contact with the different scaffolds. Each result is the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post hoc test (* p<0.05)\nThe results obtained show that cells remained viable after 4 and 7 days in the presence of the scaffolds. The 60/40 formulation presented the highest cell viability. In fact, all the tested scaffolds presented excellent viability after 7 days of incubation, indicating that these scaffolds provide an appropriate environment for cell proliferation. These results can be attributed to the osteogenic potential of ^-TCP, capable of creating a layer similar to apatite on the surface of the material99, thus inducing the proliferation of osteoblast cells.\nChapter 4\nConclusions and Future Perspectives\nThe aging of the world population has brought an increase in the number of patients suffering bone defects and diseases. The current technologies available on point of care are limited, especially when dealing with large bone defects. With this in mind, temporary and biodegradable scaffolds are an excellent alternative to overcome this problem. A variety of materials and techniques have been used for the production of scaffolds. Rapid prototyping technologies are emerging as one of the most promising tools that allows the production of 3D constructs with highly controlled structure, and even recreating the shape and dimensions of the natural tissue to replace, based on medical data. The Fab@Home model used in this work allowed the production of scaffolds with the different ratios of ^-TCP and Alginate, and may also allow for the encapsulation of cells or bioactive molecules.\nHerein, composite scaffolds with a controlled and uniform structure were produced with six different formulations. The physicochemical assays performed demonstrated that the final scaffolds maintained the crystalline structure of the ceramic component, as well as its composition. In addition, the hydrophilic character of the produced scaffolds allowed cellular adhesion and proliferation, with the surface roughness providing adequate cell anchorage. The in vitro assays suggest an adequate biocompatibility, especially for the 60/40 scaffolds. This formulation also presented the best mechanical properties, presenting mechanical characteristics better than those of trabecular bone. In addition, this scaffold presents a constitution similar to that of bone tissue, favouring osteointegration and bone regeneration.\nHowever, the porosity of all of the produced scaffolds was far from ideal, possibly hindering the bone regeneration process, being a possible improvement in further studies. In addition, it would also be interesting to perform in vivo studies to fully characterize the scaffold\u2019s potential for clinical application, since the in vitro assays performed cannot fully emulate a systemic regenerative response. Moreover, the current generation of biomaterials is mimicking and manipulating the signaling machinery inside an organism. Thus, the possible incorporation of biomolecules such as BMP\u2019s could also greatly improve the regenerative potential of these materials. Finally, the application of rapid prototyping technologies enables the delivery of personalized care, with the design of the scaffolds mimicking the exact structure of the bone defect to fill, leading to shorter healing times.\nBibliography\n[1]\tSalgado, A.J., Coutinho, O.P., and Reis, R.L.

In this context, the advent of affordable and effective rapid prototyping equipment, such as the Fab \u00a9home plotter, has contributed to the development of novel scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In this study, we report for the first time the use of a Fab \u00a9home plotter for the production of 3D scaffolds composed by beta-tricalcium phosphate (/J-TCP)/alginate hybrid materials. /J-TCP/alginate mixtures were used in a proportion of 50/50% (w/w), 30/70% (w/w) and 20/80% (w/w). The printing parameters were optimized to a nozzle diameter of 20 Gauge for the production of rigid scaffolds with pre-defined architectures. We observed that, despite using similar printing parameters, both the precision and resolution of the scaffolds were significantly affected by the blend's viscosity. In particular, we demonstrate that the higher viscosity of 50/50 scaffolds (150.0 \u00b1 3.91 mPa s) provides a higher precision in the extrusion process. The physicochemical and biological characterization of the samples demonstrated that the 50/50 scaffolds possessed a resistance to compression comparable to that of native trabecular bone. Moreover, this particular formulation also exhibited a Young's modulus that was higher than that of trabecular bone. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that osteoblasts were able to adhere, proliferate and also penetrate into the scaffold's architecture. Altogether, our findings suggest that the Fab@home printer can be employed in the manufacture of reproducible scaffolds, using a formulation 50/50 alginate-/!-TCP that has suitable properties to be applied as bone substitutes in the future.\nKeywords: rapid prototyping, bone tissue engineering, biopolymers, 3D plotter, hybrid materials\n(Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal)\n1.\tIntroduction\nThe rising number of bone defects in the last few decades has become a world-wide healthcare problem [1]. It is estimated that each year 2.2 million people around the world are subjected to bone grafting procedures [2]. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has emerged as a promising solution to repair these damaged or aged bony tissues [3].\nCurrently, rapid prototyping (RP) technologies are gaining ever growing attention since patient-specific 3D\nscaffolds can be manufactured for bone tissue regeneration. This unique technique can overcome some of the limitations of conventional fabrication methods, such as solvent casting and paniculate leaching, which use highly toxic solvents to produce 3D constructs with limited mechanical properties [4-6], In addition, by using RP it is possible to have better control of porosity and pore size than in traditional methods such as fiber mesh, fiber bonding and melt molding. Another advantage of RP technology is the possibility to manufacture, on a large scale, scaffolds with reproducibility,\nwhich differs from techniques such as phase separation which only allow a limited production [7]. These characteristics thus render RP an attractive alternative method to be used for scaffold production [4]. Furthermore, RP technologies, when combined with imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow the creation of an accurate 3D anatomic model of a specific bone tissue from a particular patient [3, 8, 9]. In fact, by segmenting a region of interest obtained in CT images, it is possible to visualize the skeleton architecture and then print a real model with a 3D plotter [3, 9]. This unique potential has prompted the use of RP in tissue engineering applications. The success of a 3D scaffold designed to be used in biomedical applications depends on several parameters, such as: (i) biocompatibility, (ii) biodegradability, (iii) surface characteristics, (iv) porosity, and (v) mechanical properties, in order to induce osteoinductivity and osteocondutivity of boneprogenitor cells and also allow neovascularization [1]. Such properties are dependent on the material chosen for scaffold manufacture and also on the technique used for its production.\nFab \u00a9home is an open source 3D printer developed by Lipson and collaborators in 2006 and it is one of the newest printers used for the manufacture of 3D structures [10]. This system provides a universal platform for 3D fabrication and has advantages over other equipment since it allows for the production of structures composed of various materials, such as plastics, polymer composites, ceramics and viscous solutions (like hydrogels). It also has a high degree of structural control, including pore size optimization [11]. Moreover, this new RP system is relatively simple to assemble and is inexpensive, it promotes the production of structures in a very short period of time with high reproducibility, and it ensures the creation of uniform and biologically optimal scaffolds, potentially becoming a commercially viable method of scaffold production [12].\nIn order to further improve and accelerate bone regeneration, scaffolds must be produced with non-toxic materials that do not elicit host immune responses [13]. Beta-tricalcium phosphate (/f-TCP.) is an interesting ceramic material that has been proposed to be applied in bone tissue regeneration due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility and osteocondutivity, which in turn contributes to bone formation through the induction of osteoblast differentiation [13, 14]. However, /LTCP also has some limitations, such as relative brittleness and poor resistance to fatigue [13, 15].\nThe combination of fi-TCP with natural biopolymers like alginate can provide 3D structures with good bioactivity, adequate mechanical properties and stability [13]. Alginate is a biocompatible natural polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds [16, 17]. This polymer is composed of 1,4-linked ff-D-mannuronic acid (M) and o'-L-guluronic acid (G) residues and has the capacity to crosslink with divalent cations [16]. Previous studies have reported the successful application of alginate for BTE [16, 18].\nIn this study, 3D hybrid scaffolds were manufactured by RP through the use of a Fab \u00a9home printer. After optimization of the extrusion parameters, the produced scaffolds comprised a hybrid mixture of /LTCP-alginate, and presented suitable\nbiological and mechanical properties to be applied in bone tissue regeneration.\n2.\tMaterials and methods\n2.1.\tPreparation of p-TCP/alginate composite scaffolds by rapid prototyping\nBioactive 3D scaffolds were produced by RP. The Fab@home printing model was used for scaffold production, since it allows for the fabrication of low-cost 3D models in a short period of time and with suitable properties to become affordable commercial products in the near future.\nHerein, three different types of scaffolds were produced by varying the ratios of fi-TCP and alginate concentrations. /LTCP/alginate scaffolds were produced using solutions prepared with /\u00a1-TCP and alginate in a proportion of 50/50% (w/w), 30/70% (w/w) and 20/80% (w/w), respectively. Initially alginate (Sigma-Aldrich, Sintra, Portugal) (Molecular weight (Mw): 120.000-190.000 Da) and /\u00a1-TCP (Panreac\u00ae1 Barcelona, Spain) solutions were prepared. Double deionized and filtered water (milli-Q-water) was obtained using a Milli-Q Advantage A10 ultrapure Water Purification System (resistivity = 18.2 MQ cm at 25 \u00b0C and total organic carbon (TOC):&lt;5 parts per billion; 0.22 gm filter) [19]. Briefly, alginate was dissolved in milli-Q water at 12% (w/v) and the solution was left overnight under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, it was sonicated for 15 min (min) in order to allow for its homogenization. Then, TCP powder was weighed in different amounts (w/w) and added to the alginate solution. Afterwards, poly(vinyl) Alcohol (PVA) (Sigma-Aldrich) (/\u00a1-TCP binder agent) was added to the polymer-bioceramic mixture in a PVA:/I-TCP mass ratio of 1:10.\nAfter the dissolution of all components, a 1% CaCb (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to the polymer-bioceramic mixture in a CaCb:alginate volume ratio of 1:2. This is an important step since CaCb crosslinks the alginate polymer chains, increasing the solution\u2019s viscosity and thus allowing better control of the extrusion process for scaffold production. The mixture\u2019s viscosities were measured by a Brookfield\u00ae DV-I Prime viscometer (3 rpm, LV-4 spindle) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFinally, a syringe (10 cc Luer Lock) was filled with the solution for posterior extrusion. The scaffolds were then immersed in a 5% (w/v) CaCb solution and incubated for 24 h at room temperature (RT). The cross-linked scaffolds were then frozen at \u201480 \u00b0C and subsequently freeze-dried for 24 h.\n2.2.\tOptimization of 3D printing parameters\nTo optimize the printing parameters, 3D constructs with a rectangular shape were extruded to make a proof of concept. These structures were drawn in CAD/CAM Software (Solidworks\u00ae Premium 2011), which allows the design of 3D models with a given architecture. To initialize the scaffold\u2019s printing process, the files were converted and stored in the STL format [20]. A layer-by-layer fabrication process was used\nTable 1. Printing parameters used in the Fab@homc printer.\nParameters\tValues\nPath width (mm)\t1.000\nPath height ( mm)\t0.800\nPushout (s)\t0.009\nSuckback (s)\t0.002\nDeposition rate\t0.001\n(mm syringe plunger motion/path length)\t\nPath speed ( mm s_1)\t10.000\nNozzle diameter (G)\t20.000\nto produce the 3D model, with the use of Fab \u00a9home v0.23 software. During the optimization of the extrusion process, several printing parameters were tested, as previously reported by Kang and collaborators [21], The optimized extrusion parameters are exhibited in table 1.\n2.3.\tFourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of the scaffold\u2019s materials [22], FTIR spectra represent the average of 128 scans obtained with a spectral range between 500 and 4000 cm-1, at a resolution of 4 cm-1. For FTIR analysis, all of the samples were crushed and the resulting powders were placed in contact with a diamond window and the spectra were recorded on a FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet iSlO) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). This technique was used to examine the scaffold\u2019s composition after the manufacturing process in order to confirm the presence of /1-TCP and alginate in the produced scaffold.\n2.4.\tX-ray diffraction analysis\nTo evaluate the characteristic phases and crystallinity of the materials that comprise the scaffolds after the production process, x-ray diffraction measurements were performed with a diffractometer (Rigaku Americas Corporation, USA). Briefly, samples were mounted in appropriate silica supports and the data were recorded over a range of 5 to 9O'J 20'ft with continuous scans at a rate of U min-1 with a copper ray tube operated at 30 kV and 20 mA [23],\n2.5.\tEnergy dispersive spectroscopy analysis\nIn order to perform the elementary characterization of the materials or, in this specific case, to evaluate the presence of calcium and phosphorus ions in the scaffold, an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Rontec) analysis was carried out. The samples were placed on an aluminum stub support, air-dried at RT and sputter-coated with gold [23],\n2.6.\tMechanical characterization of the ft-TCP/alginate composite scaffolds: resistance to compression and Young\u2019s modulus\nIn order to study the mechanical behavior of the scaffold, compression assays were performed through an adaptation of the method previously described by Santos and collaborators,\n2012 [3], In brief, lyophilized scaffolds were cut into fragments with similar dimensions. The compression assays were performed using a Zwick\u00ae 1435 Material Prufung (Ulm, Germany) with a crosshead speed of 0.2 mm min-1 and a load cell of 5 kN. Three samples from each scaffold formulation were tested and measurements were acquired in order to calculate their area. The compressive strength (Cs) of each scaffold was determined through the following equation [24],\nF\nCs =-------\t(1)\na x I\nwhere F corresponds to the load at the time of fracture and a and I are the width and length of the scaffold, respectively. Young\u2019s modulus (YM) was obtained from the stress-strain relations calculated by applying the equation [25],\nwhere Hd is the scaffold height deformation and Cs is the scaffold compressive strength, which is determined as described above. Average values and standard deviations (s.d.) were determined for each sample (n = 3).\n2.7.\tContact angle measurements\nThe determination of the contact angle of the scaffold was performed by using the sessile drop technique, with water as a reference fluid. The method used was adapted from that described by Correia and collaborators [26], The contact angle data were acquired in a Data Physics Contact Angle System OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode at RT. For each sample, water drops were placed at various locations of the analyzed scaffold.\n2.8.\tPorosity evaluation\nThe total porosity (P) of the scaffolds was determined by using a method adapted from Nie and collaborators, 2007 [27], The total amount of absolute ethanol (EtOH) that the scaffolds were able to absorb in 48 h was determined by applying the following equation from Torres and collaborators [13]:\n\u00bfethanol x ^scaffold\nwhere W1 and IT2 are the weight of the dry and the wet scaffold, respectively, \u00bf\u00abhanoi is the density of the ethanol at RT and Vscaffoid is the volume of the wet scaffold, which is directly determined by immersion. For each scaffold, three replicates were analyzed and the data represent the average of each replicate.\n2.9.\tBiological characterization of the ft-TCP/alginate composite scaffolds\n2.9.1.\tCell culture in the presence of ft-TCP/alginate scaffolds. Human osteoblasts (CRL-11372), purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM-F12) (Sigma-Aldrich), containing 10% heat inactivated fetal\nbovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom AG), streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (100 /jg mL_1) and gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich) (100 /jg mL_1), in 75 cm2 T-flasks (Orange Scientific). Cultures were maintained in a humidified environment at 37 C. with 5% CO2, until confluence was attained. The cells were then trypsinized with 0.18% trypsin (1:250) and 5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), centrifuged at 260 rpm for 5 min and the resulting pellet was resuspended into 5 mL of complete culture medium. Prior to cell seeding, the scaffolds were cut into the desired size (10% of the well) and placed into 96-well plates for sterilization. Briefly, the scaffolds were initially sterilized in a 70% EtOH solution and then extensively washed with DMEM-F12 medium. This procedure was followed by sterilization by ultraviolet (UV) light for another 30 min. Prior to contact with the osteoblasts, the scaffolds were equilibrated with complete culture medium at 37 C for 24 h. Then, the cells were seeded onto the scaffold\u2019s surface at a density of 10 x 103 cells per well in order to characterize scaffold cytotoxicity after one and seven days. The culture medium was changed every two days during the experiments.\n2.9.2.\tScanning electron microscopy analysis. The scaffold\u2019s morphology, pore size and cellular attachment in the presence of the scaffold were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [13], Samples were washed at RT with cacodylate buffer solution and fixed for 30 min with 2.5% (v/v) glutharaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate. The samples were then washed three times with cacodylate buffer and finally incubated for 10 min in a graded series of ethanol solutions (50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 99.9%) for dehydration. The scaffolds were then stored in absolute ethanol, at 4 C. until being subjected to CO2 critical point drying. Afterward, the samples were mounted onto aluminum stubs with Araldite glue and then sputter-coated with gold using an Emitech K550 sputter coater. SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi S-2700 (Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, at variable magnifications.\n2.9.3.\tEvaluation of the scaffold\u2019s cytotoxic profile. To evaluate the cytotoxic profile of the 3D scaffolds, human osteoblast (CRL-11372) cells were seeded in the presence of the materials in 96-well plates at a density of 10 X 103 cells per well. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3 carboxymethoxyphenyl) 2-(4-sulphofenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay, supplied by Promega, was used to evaluate cell viability after one and seven days of the cells being seeded. After an incubation of 24 h, the metabolic activity of the cells was evaluated by quantifying the metabolic reduction of tetrazolium salt into soluble formazan [28], Briefly, the medium of each well was removed and the cells in contact with the scaffold were incubated with a mixture of 100 pL of fresh culture medium and 20 pL of MTS/PMS solution, for 4 h at 37 C. After incubation, the supernatant was transferred into a 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Anthos 2010, Alfagene \u00ae).\nFive replicates of each sample were used for each experimental condition. Cells cultured without materials were\nused as negative controls for cytotoxicity (K\u2014)) and cells treated with EtOH (96%) were used as a positive control for cytotoxicity (K+).\n2.9.4. Confocal microscopy analysis. The analysis of the distribution of osteoblasts within 3D scaffolds was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Briefly, four days after cell seeding, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed three times with cacodylate buffer at RT. The remaining cells were then fixed with cacodylate buffer for 30 min at RT. Afterwards, the cell nucleus was labeled with propidium iodide (1:1000) (PI) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, MO, USA) solution, during 15 min, at RT, followed by six additional washes with cacodylate buffer. The cell-seeded scaffolds were then transferred into p-Slide eight well Ibidi\u00ae chamber coverslips and imaged in a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., USA), which was equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 10 x /NA 0.3 objective. All data were acquired in z-stack mode with a step of 4.67 pm. Z-stacks were then rendered into 3D images in the Zeiss Zen 2010 software. The depth code rendering of z-stacks was also performed in Zeiss 2010 software with the open GL and transparent rendering mode to provide visualization of cell spatial distribution within the scaffold architecture [13],\n2.10.\tStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of the results obtained for the different groups of scaffolds at various conditions was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the Newman-Keuls post hoc test [13], The statistical test was used for comparison of the mean and the differences between groups [29], Ap value less than 0.05 (p &lt;0.05) was considered statistically significant.\n3.\tResults and discussion\n3.1.\tPrinting parameters used for scaffold production\nIn this work, several Fab @ home parameters were optimized in order to produce the 3D scaffolds. These parameters include: path width (mm), which represents the distance between adjacent paths of each layer; the distance between adjacent layers, which is named path height (mm); the pushout (s), which is the time of extrusion before the cartridge moves; the suckback (s), which is the opposite of the pushout; the deposition rate (mm syringe plunger motion/mm drawn path); the path speed (mm s_1) of the cartridge; and, the nozzle diameter (mm). One of the objectives of this work was to study of the influence of solutions with different compositions in the extrusion process. For this purpose, the same Fab parameters were used for all of the ceramic-polymer blends tested.\nTable 1 displays the parameters used for the extrusion of the ceramic-polymer mixture. First, through the analysis of the effect of nozzle diameter we concluded, in an initial step, that varying the nozzle diameter would affect all of the parameters studied (table 1). So, we first predetermined the diameter of the nozzle (20 Gauge) and only then optimized\n2 cm\n2 cm\n2 cm\n2 cm\n(\u00a3)\n:::\n\u2022\t\u25a0 \u25a0 I\n\u2022\t* 0) 1\n\u2022 \u2022 fl\n\u25a0 T. ;\nFigure 1.

Taking into account that the viscosity of the different blends was not the same and is dependent on the /{-TCP. as shown in table 2, we tried to approximate the parameters to obtain the best results in all of the mixtures. For the 50/50 scaffolds, which have a composition of 50:50 (w/w)\nof /1-TCP: alginate, the resultant ceramic-polymer mixture presents a higher viscosity, making the extrusion process easier (table 2). Conversely, the extrusion process is more difficult to control for more fluid solutions, such as in the case of the 30/70 and 20/80 mixtures, where the /{-TCP powder concentration is lower. This shows that the solution viscosities are dependent on /{-TCP content. The chosen parameters were more suitable for the 50/50 mixture due to the higher viscosity of this ceramic-polymer solution. This initial optimization has allowed us to print scaffolds with six layers of alginate- /{-TCP blends and with defined dimensions (width: 11 mm; length: 7 mm; height: 14 mm).

It was possible to observe that, despite using the same manufacturing process and printing parameters (table 1) for all produced scaffolds, the images obtained revealed some differences between scaffolds, as can be observed in figure 1. It was also noticed that the 50/50 scaffolds (figure 1(A)) have a better defined structure than the 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds (figures 1(B), (Q). The results suggest that for the 50/50, the optimized printing parameters were better. For the optimized parameters, the findings suggest that for higher viscosity solutions (table 2), the extrusion process is easier since a lower viscosity can cause spreading of the mixture, thus originating structures with less well-defined architectures.\nFurthermore, such results may also be explained by the fact that the 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds had a higher\nconcentration of alginate. According to the descriptions in previous literature, the major disadvantage of the use of the alginate is related to its reticulation rate; that is, it is too fast and difficult to control, resulting in structures that are not always uniform, as can be observed in figure 1(C) [30]. The 50/50 scaffolds, which have a lower concentration of alginate and a higher concentration of (5 -TCP, when compared to 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds, presented a better defined structure, as can be observed in figure 1(A). It is also important to emphasize that the morphological characteristics of the different scaffolds were maintained during all of the experiments, illustrating the reproducibility of the printing process used here.\n3.3.\tPhysicochemical characterization\nFTIR analyses were performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the 50/50, 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds produced by RP. Figure 2(1) shows the different FTIR spectra obtained for the samples. The spectra of (5 -TCP powder and scaffolds showed a major band at 1020 cm-1 (figure 2(1), area (A)), which is typically assigned to the P-O stretching vibration, revealing the presence of the inorganic phosphate components of /{-TCP [3]. The alginate powder spectra revealed peaks at 1600 and 1400 cm-1 (figure 2(1), area (B)) which are also present in the scaffold samples, and are assigned to the C = O stretching vibration of the carboxylic group of alginate, respectively [31, 32]. Moreover, both alginate alone and the scaffold's spectra presented a band between 3000-3700 cm-1 (figure 2, area (Q) belonging to the -OH stretch of water and -OH groups of the G and M units of alginate [33]. This band has a higher intensity in the scaffold's spectra, indicating the successful inclusion of alginate in the scaffold. The characteristic peak of PVA is not present in the scaffold samples due to the trace amounts that were used in their production.\nFurther characterization of the samples was done by XRD analysis to confirm the presence of crystalline phases of /{-TCP. Figure 2(1) shows two intense peaks located at 20 = 25,J-32'J. These peaks are characteristic of (5-TCP, they can also be observed for the commercial \u00a13-TCP spectra (figures 2(3) (A) (b)) [3]. These characteristic\n500pm\n10pm\n50/50 Scaffold\n20/80 Scaffold\n500pm\n500pm\nO'\nFigure 5. SEM images of the morphology and pore sizes of scaffolds.

Consequently, it is important to underline that, after all of the processing and manipulation during manufacturing, the ceramic component of the scaffolds preserved its crystalline structure since no amorphous crystalline phases were identified.\nFurthermore, EDS analysis of the scaffolds shows a slight increase in phosphate and calcium ions in the 50/50 scaffold, followed by 30/70 and 20/80, respectively (figure 2\n(3)). These results are in agreement with those obtained for the scaffold\u2019s /J-TC.P composition and after the scaffold\u2019s reticulation.\n3.4.\tAlginate//\u00a1-TCP composite scaffolds: mechanical characterization\nA suitable scaffold to be used for bone regeneration must possess both flexibility and resistance to compression. The mechanical behavior of the 3D scaffolds was characterized by testing their resistance to compression and by determining the YM (figure 3). Through the analysis of figure 3, it is possible to observe that the YM and compressive strength is higher for the 50/50 scaffolds when compared to the 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds. This shows that the increase of -TCP concentration contributes to a YM and compressive strength increase. The results obtained for the mechanical characterization are consistent with a study previously performed by Matsuno and collaborators, where \u00a15-TCP was selected to reinforce the initial strength of an alginate hydrogel [34],\nMoreover, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds are correlated with the biodegradability rate [7], Scaffolds with improved mechanical properties have a slower degradation rate, maintaining their mechanical stability [35], This is important because the biodegradation must be compatible with\nthe ingrowth of bone progenitor cells and deposition of bone matrix [36], The 50/50 scaffolds present better mechanical properties and it is expected that they will have a slower degradation rate and, consequently, a greater mechanical stability in comparison with the other formulations, thereby, maintaining the spaces required for cell ingrowth and matrix production during bone formation [7], Furthermore, by comparing the mechanical properties of the 50/50 scaffolds with those presented by natural trabecular bone it is possible to observe that 3D scaffolds have a compressive strength comparable to that of natural trabecular bone [36, 37], Interestingly, the produced scaffolds have a higher YM than that of trabecular bone [37], This suggests that, in addition to having good compressive strength, the 50/50 scaffolds will also have more elasticity than natural trabecular bone, which supports its application to bone tissue regeneration.\n3.5.\tDetermination of the water contact angle\nAnother important physicochemical property which influences the bioactivity and regenerative capacity of a scaffold is its hydrophilic character [38], The hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the surface of the 3D structures was characterized by determining their contact angles [38], According to the descriptions of several previous studies, the hydrophilic properties of the scaffolds are very important for cell attachment and nutrient diffusion, a phenomenon which is fundamental for maintaining cell viability [22], Wei and collaborators reported that the osteoblast cell adhesion increases when the water contact angle of the material surface decreases [38], Generally, surfaces are considered hydrophilic when the contact angle ranges between 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 and are considered as mildly hydrophilic when it is between\nBSH\nDay 1\nDay 7\nFigure 6.

The results obtained ( table 3) show that all samples presented a moderately hydrophilic character since the contact angle mean is around 70.4\u00b0 \u00b1 4.3 [40],\nThe hydrophilic character presented by the 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds is mostly a consequence of the high number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups present in alginate [16], The hydrophilic properties of 50/50 scaffolds may be related to the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, although they are present in smaller percentages than those found in 30/70 and 20/80, respectively. Moreover, the roughness of their surface caused by the presence of /J-TCP powders may largely affect\nTable 3.

A recent study has reported that hydrophilic scaffolds allow cell adhesion and differentiation, as well as infiltration of oxygen and nutrients into the scaffolds, which have an essential role in the successful use of these 3D constructs in repairing bone defects [13],\n3.6.\tDetermination of the scaffolds\u2019 total porosity\nTo evaluate the total porosity of the scaffolds, the liquid displacement method using EtOH was performed [27]. One of the most important requirements for the production of scaffolds to be used in bone tissue regeneration is to achieve an equilibrium between the scaffolds\u2019 porosity and their mechanical properties [7], The porosity influences both the mechanical and biological properties of the scaffolds\n[41], In the scaffolds produced, the overall structure is similar throughout the different compositions, with the largest differences in porosity deriving from the composition itself. From the analysis of figure 4, it is possible to conclude that the 50/50 scaffolds presented the highest value of total porosity (52% \u00b1 3.2) when compared to the 30/70 (46% \u00b1 3.5) and 20/80 (23% \u00b1 8.0) scaffolds. According to the previous descriptions of Santos and collaborators, these porosity results can be correlated with the density of the scaffolds [3] since porosity and density are inversely proportional. Furthermore, the particle size is known to affect the total porosity of the scaffolds [13], Our results are in agreement with those reported by Balakrishnan and collaborators, wherein molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. They concluded that the formation of agglomerates depends on the application of forces to compact the particles [42]. The powder materials (/J-TCP, mean particle size 11.64 /.tm) used in scaffold manufacture have microporosities which are caused by the voids formed between these particles agglomerates [3], The 50/50 scaffolds have more /J-TCP and, subsequently, a higher degree of microporosity within the printed fiber layers, resulting in a higher scaffold porosity (figure 1(D)). On the other hand, the 30/70 and 20/80 scaffolds have a higher amount of alginate. This polymer fills in the space gaps between /(-TCP microparticles, which contributes to a reduced total porosity. In conclusion, 50/50 scaffolds present all of the characteristics to allow for better cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and also facilitate the transport of oxygen and nutrients.\n3.7.\tCharacterization of the scaffolds\u2019 biocompatibility\nAs previously described in the literature, cellular behavior depends largely on the material\u2019s surface properties. Surface\nDay 1\nDay 7\nFigure 7. SEM micrographs of osteoblasts morphology in the presence of the different /J-TCP/alginatc formulations. 50/50 scaffolds (A), (BY 30/70 scaffolds (CT (D) and 20/80 scaffolds'(EY (F)\nroughness has a direct influence on cellular morphology, adhesion and proliferation [8], Human osteoblasts attach more rapidly and produce more extracellular matrix in the presence of rough surfaces than in the presence of smoother surfaces\n[43]\t,\nIn the results obtained in SEM images, the 50/50 scaffolds showed a slightly regular surface (figure 1(A)) and a high level of roughness (figure 1(D)). which contributes toward the osteoblasts' adhesion and proliferation within the scaffold. Cell adhesion to the surface of these scaffolds is affected by an increase in the anchoring area and spots for cell contact\n[44]\t, Furthermore, the literature describes that the contact area increases with increasing surface roughness [44],\nMoreover, as previously mentioned, rough surfaces are known to affect the material wettability, influencing both the material's hydrophilic character and material-cell interactions [43, 45], The SEM images of the 50/50 scaffolds corroborate the fact that these scaffold surfaces are rough, justifying the hydrophilicity values obtained for these 3D structures ( table 3).\nSubsequently, the pore diameter of the scaffolds was studied. According to the literature, the rates of alginate crosslinking can influence the scaffold's structure, shape and pore size [30], Another factor that can affect the pore size\nis the crosslinker concentration [46], The results presented in figures 5(C), (D) show that the pore diameter of the scaffolds ranged between 551 and 875 (im. The pore diameter is smaller in the 20/80 scaffolds, which can be explained by the higher percentage of alginate. This may be related to the fact that there are more calcium-alginate connections, which in turn lead to the pore's closure. These results are in agreement with those obtained for total porosity. In the 50/50 scaffolds, where alginate concentration is lower, the pore size is larger since there are fewer calcium-alginate connections to occlude the spaces between -TCP particles.\nThese results are of crucial importance since pore diameters ranging from 200 to 900 |im have been shown to improve osteoblast bone deposition and proliferation while ensuring nutrient distribution [7],\nTo confirm the potential application of the 50/50 scaffold in bone tissue engineering, the scaffold's biological properties were thoroughly characterized. Regarding the scaffold's bioactivity, the optical microscopy images acquired at one and seven days after cell seeding show that the cells proliferated in the presence of the /I-TCP/alginate scaffolds (figures 6(A)\u2014 (F)). These results are similar to those obtained for nonincubated cells (negative control) (figures 6(G)-(/7)). In the\nFigure 8.

Dead cells with their typical spherical shape can be observed in figures 6(7) and (J). In addition, SEM analysis was performed to characterize cellular morphology and adhesion, both on the surface and inside the scaffolds.\nSEM images of the scaffolds in the presence of cells show that cells adhered and grew within the /J-TCP/alginate scaffolds after one day of being in the presence of the scaffold (see figures 7 (A), (O, (E)). To evaluate if the cells remained viable and proliferated with time, SEM images were also acquired after seven days. These images showed that cells were extensively attached and had spread on the surface of the 0-TCP/alginate scaffolds (figures 7(B), (\u00a3)). (F)).\nThe in vitro cytotoxicity analysis showed a significant difference between cells in the presence of /J-TCP/alginate and the positive control after one and seven days of incubation, suggesting that the scaffolds did not affect cell viability (figure 8). The MTS assay also showed a significant difference in the results obtained for the 50/50 and 20/80 scaffolds between the first and seventh day. The 30/70 scaffold did not present a significant difference within this period of time.\nIt is also possible to observe that cell viability is higher for the 50/50 scaffolds; that is, with the increase of /J-TCP, an increase in cell viability was observed (figure 8). Furthermore, these results are supported by the data obtained by Fuji and collaborators, who reported that apatite formation\nthrough \u00bf\u00a1-TCP dissolution at physiological conditions affects the osteoblasts\u2019 behavior [23], The presence of Ca2+ and PO43- resultant of \u00bf\u00a1-TCP dissolution is important for the osteoconduction and osteoinduction processes, providing a favorable environment for osteoblast attachment and growth.\nCLSM analysis showed that the osteoblasts are distributed within 50/50 scaffolds, further highlighting their biocompatibility and appropriate physicochemical properties for bone regenerative medicine (figure 9(A)). These data further corroborates the results obtained through SEM analysis.\nIn figure 9(B) it is possible to observe the 3D reconstruction and depth analysis of the 50/50 scaffold. These results show that the osteoblasts are capable of migrating and attach into deep sections of the scaffolds. Some cells were localized up to 200 gm within the scaffold\u2019s architecture (figure 9(B)). This is of crucial importance since the deposition of bone matrix inside the scaffold will eventually fill the bone defect while the scaffold is biodegraded, ultimately leading to the establishment of the original structure and function of the native bone.\n4.\tConclusions\nThis work has described the manufacture of \u00bf\u00a1-TCP/alginate scaffolds through a rapid prototyping technology, which may be used in bone regeneration applications. The equipment used, in particular the Fab@home personal fabricator, allowed us to easily and rapidly create and optimize several different models of scaffolds, as well as to test different materials. The method used has also allowed high reproducibility between different printings. In addition, the ease of use and low maintenance costs give this equipment the potential to revolutionize scaffold manufacture at a large scale and in an economically viable way.\nFurthermore, the optimal 50/50 scaffold formulation presented a well-defined morphology, with excellent biological properties for bone tissue regeneration applications. Moreover, the technology used offers the possibility of modelling the scaffold to a specific bone defect. However, despite the excellent results achieved, further studies will need to be performed to improve the properties of the scaffolds, including functionalizing their surface with molecules in order to facilitate bioadhesion and improving their mechanical properties by the use of different polymers or ceramics.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank to Eng.

Introduction\nBone is a highly vascularized and dynamic tissue, having extraordinary mechanical properties and intrinsic regenerative capacity [1]. This exceptional characteristic is however rather limited in severe bone traumatisms that involve multiple fractures, bone-associated tumors and degenerative diseases [2]. These are highly debilitating conditions that commonly require medical intervention to restore bone native properties [3].\nCurrently, several types of biomaterials, such as biofunctional prosthesis [4], injectable substrates [5] and hydrogels [6] are being produced for bone regeneration purposes. Among them, bioactive 3D porous scaffolds are particularly promising for clinical application due to their unique set of characteristics. Scaffolds are porous 3D matrices that act as temporary templates for cell adhesion and proliferation, while providing mechanical support until new bone tissue is formed at the affected area [7]. For this purpose these scaffolds must be produced with materials that promote proper regeneration without eliciting host immune responses or originating toxic metabolites [8]. The 3D features of the template is another critical parameter when therapeutic applications are envisioned, since its spatial architecture should be designed to have interconnected pores that simultaneously induce osteoconductivity of bone-progenitor cells and\n* Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2013.07.003\nneovascularization [9]. To further improve and accelerate bone regeneration it is essential that the scaffold is bioactive, i.e., has the ability to form anchoring points with the surrounding bone and soft tissues, stimulating bone growth. Commonly these bonds are formed through an HA-like layer and are responsible for increasing osteointegration and cell growth and differentiation [10].\nThe desire to gather these complex characteristics into one scaffold is a challenging demand, not only in the design and manufacturing stages, but also in the translation to in vivo applications. In this context, the combination of ceramics with polymers for the synthesis of hybrid scaffolds has been widely investigated in an attempt to mimic bone tissue native structure [11,12]. p-TCP and HA are the most commonly used ceramics since their mineral compositions are similar to those found in human bone [11,13]. Although p-TCP has been extensively used for bone regeneration due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility and osteoconductivity [14,15] its applications to bone tissue regeneration are limited by its poor mechanical properties [16,17].\nIn different studies bioceramic-based scaffolds have been modified with polymers (as coating or interpenetrating phases) in order to reduce their brittleness and improve mechanical properties [18-21]. In the present study, p-TCP/HA scaffolds were left uncoated or coated with alginate. This polymer is comprised by 1,4'-linked p-D-mannuronic acid and a-L-guluronic acid blocks, which determines alginate physicochemical properties. This natural biomaterial has valuable characteristics, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, hydrophilicity, low toxicity and gelling capacity with divalent cations [22-25]. In fact, its\nresponsiveness to calcium (Ca2+)-rich tissue microenvironments, renders it suitable for scaffold coating in bone tissue engineering, as previously reported by our group [26]. Importantly, the ionically crosslinked alginate mechanical strength rises with increasing divalent ion concentration, and also when these ions have high affinity for alginate [27]. Due to these valuable characteristics, this polymer has been widely used in biomedical applications, including cell encapsulation [28] and drug loading and delivery [29].\nIn this context, this work reports the production of p-TCP/HA scaffolds by the foam replication method (FRM), followed by their coating with alginate. The scaffold production method used is simple, cost-effective, excludes the use of organic solvents and, most importantly, allows the manufacture of reproducible structures. Three types of scaffolds with different [1-TCP:HA ratios and alginate coatings were developed and their physicochemical and biological properties investigated.\n2.\tMaterials and methods\n2.1.\tPreparation of li-TCP/HA composite scaffolds followed by alginate coating\np-TCP/HA scaffolds were produced using a polymer-based FRM, which allows the control of the dimensions, pore size and density of the 3D scaffold. Three different types of scaffolds were prepared, concerning the quantity of p-TCP (Panreac\u00ae) relatively to HA nanopowder (<200 nm particle size, Sigma-Aldrich): 80/20% (w/w), 90/10% (w/w) and 99/1% (w/w), respectively. Poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) (Sigma-Aldrich) (p-TCP binder agent) was added to the polymer mixture in a ratio of 1:10 (% w/w) PVA:p-TCP. Briefly, to prepare the polymer blends, PVA was dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water, under constant stirring, for 30 min, at 50 \u00b0C. Then, both p-TCP and HA powders were added in small amounts to the solution, under constant stirring at room temperature (RT). After all the powder was wetted, the mixture was sonicated for 15 min. The used polyurethane (PU) foams had similar structures to that of the human cancellous bone and were cut (5x5x5 mm3) to be used as a sacrificial template for the FRM. All the PU foams were cleaned in a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Sigma-Aldrich) solution, followed by rinsing twice with distilled water before air-dried for 12 h. The PU foams were then repeatedly immersed in the polymer blends in order to promote polymer penetration into the PU foam pores. The PU foams impregnated with the polymer blends were then gently squeezed to remove the excess of the slurry. Homogeneous coating of the PU foams with p-TCP/HA was possible after several immersions. The coated PU foams were exposed to air, allowed to dry overnight, at RT, and then sintered. Briefly, the PU-polymer foams were step-wise heated in a furnace at 1 \u00b0C/min to 900 \u00b0C and then kept at this temperature for 240 min. Additionally, some of the 3D scaffolds were subsequently coated with a 2% sodium alginate (Sigma-Aldrich) solution, (molecular weight (Mw) 120.000-190.000 Da), under vacuum at RT, for 30 min, in order to guarantee alginate inclusion within the scaffold pores. These coated scaffolds were then immersed in a 5% calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution (Sigma-Aldrich), under vacuum for 10 min, in order to cross-link alginate-coated scaffolds. The structures were maintained in the CaCl2 solution for 24 h and then air dried, prior to use. From this point onwards alginate coated p-TCP/HA scaffolds are identified as: 80/20/A, 90/10/A and 99/1/A and the uncoated scaffolds as 80/20, 90/10 and 99/1.\n2.2.\tChemical, mechanical and morphological characterization of the /3-TCP/HA composite scaffolds\n2.2.1.\tFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\nThe physicochemical characteristics of the manufactured 3D scaffolds were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) by using a Nicolet iS10 interferometer (Thermo Scientific,\nWaltham, MA, USA). Briefly, samples were mounted on a diamond window and compressed to improve spectrum signal to noise ratio. For each sample, 128 interferograms were acquired with a spectral width ranging from 4000 to 400 cm-1 and a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1. The acquired data was then processed in Omnic Spectra analysis software, where baseline subtraction was performed.\n2.2.2.\tEnergy dispersive spectroscopy\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Rontec) was used for the elementary characterization of both, coated and uncoated, p-TCP/HA scaffolds. Prior to all analyses, samples were placed on an aluminum stub support, air-dried at RT and sputter-coated with gold.\n2.2.3.\tResistance to compression, fracture toughness and Young's modulus\nTo characterize the mechanical behavior of the cuboid-shaped coated and uncoated scaffolds, uniaxial compression tests were performed. All the measurements were performed at RT using a Zwick\u00ae 1435 Material Prufung (Ulm, Germany) with a crosshead speed of 0.2 mm/min and a load cell of 5 kN. Four specimens from each sample were tested and their dimensions acquired. Afterwards, compressive strength (Cs) of each type of scaffold was calculated by applying Eq. (1) [30].\nCs = \u201cA\na x l\n(1)\nwhere F is the load at the time of the fracture and a and l represent the width and length of the scaffold, respectively. The fracture toughness (FT) and Young's modulus (YM) were estimated from the stress-strain relations calculated and applying Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively [31,32].\nFT =\nHd x Cs\n2\n(2)\nYM =\nCs\nHd\n(3)\nwhere Hd is the scaffold height deformation and Cs is the scaffold compressive strength. Average values and standard deviations (s.d.) were determined for each sample as previously described in the literature [33].\n2.2.4.\tScanning electron microscopy\nIn order to assess scaffold morphology, porosity and cellular behavior in the presence of the samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed. Samples were washed at RT with phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) (Sigma-Aldrich) and fixed for 30 min with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in a 0.1 M sodium cacodylate solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, samples were washed three times with cacodylate buffer and finally incubated for 10 min in a graded series of ethanol solutions (50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 99% v/v), for dehydration. Scaffolds were then stored in absolute ethanol, at 4 \u00b0C, until being subjected to CO2 critical point drying, mounted onto aluminum stubs with araldite glue and sputtered-coated with gold using an Emitech K550 sputter coater (London, UK). SEM images were obtained with a scanning electron microscope Hitachi S-2700 (Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV at suitable magnifications.\n2.2.5.\tPorosity evaluation\nThe total porosity (P) of the different types of p-TCP/HA scaffolds, was determined by following a method described elsewhere [34]. The amount of absolute ethanol that the scaffolds were able to absorb in 24 h, was determined by applying Eq. (4).\nP(% ) =\nW2-W1 dethanol x Vscaffold\nX 100\n(4)\nwhere W, and W2 are the weights of the dry and the wet scaffolds, respectively, dethanol is the density of the ethanol at RT and Vscaffold is the\nvolume of the wet scaffold, directly determined by immersion. For each scaffold, three replicates were analyzed and data represents the average of each replicate.\n2.2.6.\tContact angle measurements\nThe contact angle measurements of the samples were performed using the sessile drop technique and water was used as reference fluid [35]. Contact angle data was acquired in a Data Physics Contact Angle System OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode at RT. For each sample, water drops were placed at various locations of the analyzed surface.\n2.3.\tBiological characterization of the fi-TCP/HA composite scaffolds\n2.3.1.\tCulture of human osteoblasts in the presence of the scaffolds\nHuman osteoblasts (CRL-11372), purchased from American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium, Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM-F12) (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom AG), streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (100 pg/mL) and gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich) (100 pg/mL), in 75 cm2 T-flasks (Orange Scientific). Cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and the culture medium exchanged twice a week. Confluent cell monolayers were subcultured by initially washing them with PBS, and then detached with 0.18% trypsin (1:250) and 5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). A Neubauer chamber was used to determine cell number using trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) \u2014 exclusion assay, in order to distinguish live from dead cells. Subsequently, cells were seeded in contact with 80/20, 90/10, 99/1, 80/20/A, 90/10/A and 99/1/A scaffolds at a density of 2.0 x 103 cells/well in cell culture treated polystyrene plates. Cell growth was monitored during 1, 7 and 14 days, by using an Olympus CX41 inverted light microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus SP-500 UZ digital camera.\n2.3.2.\tCellular metabolic activity: resazurin assay\nOsteoblast cells were cultured on scaffold surfaces for 1, 7 and 14 days. A non-toxic dye, specifically, resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich) was\nused to assess cellular metabolic activity during this period. Resazurin is reduced to a fluorescent resorufin substrate by an intracellular enzyme, specifically oxidoreductase. At the indicated time points of culture, 400 pL of culture medium was added to the wells with 40 pL of a 10% (v/v) fluorescent dye solution and incubated for 4 h, in a humidified atmosphere, at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. Then, 80 pL of the supernatant was transferred into a 96-well plate and the fluorescence intensity measured in a SpectraMax Gemini\u2122 XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices), at Nex = 545 nm and Nem = 590 nm, respectively. Cells cultured without scaffolds were used as negative control and ethanol treated cells were used as positive control.\n2.3.3.\tAnalysis of 3D scaffolds biologic properties\nThe analysis of osteoblast adhesion and morphology on the 3D scaffold surfaces at various days (1,7 and 14) was visualized by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Briefly, at pre-determined time points the cell culture medium was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS at RT. The remaining cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, at RT, and were washed once more with PBS to remove PFA. Afterwards, the cell nucleus was labeled with 2 pM propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, MO, USA) solution during 15 min, at RT, followed by five additional washes with PBS. Furthermore, propidium iodide stained cells were also permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and then blocked with blocking solution (10% FBS, 0.1% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich)) in PBS, for 10 min. Afterwards, cells were incubated with mouse anti-p-actin antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) (1:500) for 1 h at RT in a humidified chamber. Following the incubation period osteoblasts were thoroughly washed with PBS-T (0.1% Tween in PBS). The anti-mouse Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) antibody was then added to cells during 1 h, followed by the washing steps as previously described. The cell-seeded scaffolds were then transferred into p-Slide 8 well Ibidi\u00ae chamber coverslips (Ibidi\u00ae GmbH, Germany) and imaged in a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., USA) equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 10x/NA 0.3 and a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil DIC objectives. All data was\nFig. 1. Macrographs (A, B and C) and SEM images (D, E and F) of the different alginate-coated p-TCP/HA scaffold surfaces.

Z-stacks were then rendered into 3D images in the Zeiss LSM 710 software. Depth coding rendering of z-stacks was also performed in Zeiss software with the open GL rendering mode to provide visualization of cell spatial distribution within the scaffold architecture. Additional image processing was performed in Image J (ImageJ software) [36].\n2.4.\tStatistical analysis\nComparison of the results obtained for the different groups of scaffolds at various conditions was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test [37].\nFig. 2. Total porosity of the different (3-TCP/HA scaffolds. Alginate (+) indicates coated scaffolds and alginate (\u2014) the uncoated scaffolds. N.S.: not significant; *p &lt;0.05, n = 3.\nThis statistical test is applied to compare the mean and the differences among three different groups [38]. Thus in this particular case the ANOVA test was used to evaluate the differences in the means of three samples of different scaffold formulations by using variances. This test was performed by taking into consideration that the samples are independent from each other and that the variance of the populations is equal. The addition of the post-hoc Newman-Keuls test was used to further provide a more detailed analysis of differences in the means by making a multi-pairwise comparison [39]. A p value below 0.05 (p &lt;0.05) was considered statistically significant.\n3.\tResults and discussion\nIn this study the physicochemical, mechanical and biological characteristics of 3D porous scaffolds produced with two bioceramics, 3-TCP and HA, were investigated. So far, two ratios of 3-TCP and HA were successfully tested in humans, specifically, 50/50 and 40/60 [40,41]. Herein, the use of higher percentages of 3-TCP relatively to HA was evaluated to produce scaffolds with improved mechanical properties for bone regeneration.\nFurthermore, an alginate coating was added to the scaffolds to include an additional biomaterial that could mimic the extracellular matrix present in native bone cells, and also that would enhance the mechanical strength of the structure, improving its osteoconduction and osteointegration within host bone tissues [42]. Alginate was also chosen to be included in this study since its combination with 3-TCP and HA forms a rigid hybrid polymer-ceramic biomimetic composite, without eliciting any immune response, or risk of contamination by allo- or xeno-proteins or viruses, unlike, for instance, collagen [43]. Furthermore, the FRM method used to produce the 3D structures allows the production of interconnected porous scaffolds with rough surfaces, with controllable pore size and porosity within the template geometry [44-46].\n3.1. fi-TCP/HA composite scaffold production: macroscopic, mechanical and physicochemical characterization\nAs previously described in the literature, scaffolds produced for bone tissue regeneration must have adequate external and internal structures, as well as desirable physicochemical characteristics that mimic the extracellular matrix of bone cells and also bone native properties. The uncoated 3-TCP/HA (Supplementary Fig. 1) and alginate-coated 3-TCP/HA scaffolds (Fig. 1) produced by FRM have well defined\nAlginate (+)\n\u00a3 Alginate (-)\nFig. 3.

Interestingly, although the (3-TCP and HA components of bone substitutes were different among the tested scaffolds, all of them presented surfaces with some degree of roughness, even after being coated with alginate. These findings assume further importance since roughness largely influences protein adsorption and cell adhesion upon scaffold implantation\n[47]\t. In fact, as recently reported by Gittens and co-workers [48], micro- and macro-sized topographic surface roughness of bone substitutes improves osteoblast differentiation and localized growth factor production, thus enhancing scaffold osteointegration in bone defects\n[48]\t. Moreover, SEM analysis confirmed the presence of micro- and macro-porosity throughout the alginate-coated (Fig. 1) and the uncoated scaffolds (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nThe results presented in Table 1 revealed that the 80/20 formulation has the larger sized pores when compared to the 90/10 and 99/1 scaffolds. After performing the alginate coating, a clear decrease in the pore size was observed, in comparison with their uncoated counterparts (Table 1). Nevertheless, all the coated scaffolds maintained suitable pore diameters for use in bone regeneration, with the 80/20/A structure being the one with larger pores. Such is of crucial importance, since pore diameters ranging from 100 pm to 135 pm have shown to improve osteoblast-bone deposition and formation of rich vascular networks [49].\nFurthermore, other important physicochemical properties, such as hydrophilicity and total percentage of porosity of the scaffolds, influence their bioactivity and regenerative capacity. As shown in Table 1 the measured values of the contact angles for the 90/10 and 99/1 scaffolds, indicate that these templates are highly hydrophilic. It is important to\nmention that the contact angle of the 80/20 scaffold could not be calculated, due to the rapid absorption of the water drop by the porous structure, suggesting that this scaffold is highly hydrophilic. However, after performing alginate inclusion, it was possible to determine the 80/20/A contact angle and it was found that this value is quite low, suggesting that, even after its coating, this scaffold remains as the most hydrophilic of the three coated scaffolds (Table 1). Although the contact angle values of the alginate-coated structures suffered a slight increase when compared to the respective uncoated ones, they remained in the range of hydrophilic associated angles, suggesting that these structures were also hydrophilic. These results indicate that cellular adhesion and migration within the 80/20/A might occur in an improved manner, since this scaffold is highly hydrophilic, and the presence of alginate may create additional biomimetic substrates between the pores, increasing the available areas within the scaffolds for cells to migrate.\nThe total percentage of scaffold porosity was determined by a liquid displacement method, using ethanol as the displacing liquid [50]. By analyzing Fig. 2, it is possible to observe that all the scaffolds present an internal porosity higher than 60%, a suitable value for bone regeneration, considering that the human cancellous bone bears a total porosity of 30% to 90% [51]. More importantly, the 80/20 scaffold presents the higher value of porosity (76%), when compared to the 90/10 and 99/1 scaffolds. These results corroborate the previous findings concerning the diameter of the pores and the contact angles. Such results may, at first glance, seem to be in contradiction with those previously published in the literature [52,53]. These researchers reported that porosity is inversely proportional to HA concentration. Furthermore, Muralithran and collaborators, have previously reported that by increasing the sintering temperature (from 1000 \u00b0C to 1450 \u00b0C), the relative density and linear shrinkage of HA ceramics increase and consequently the porosity decreases [54]. In this study a 900 \u00b0C temperature was used in the sintering process, which could influence the porosity results. Moreover, the increase in scaffold porosity with a higher HA (w/w) content in the scaffolds may be explained by the fact that there is a larger relative concentration of smaller sized particles in respect to those of (3-TCP (HA nanoparticles &lt;200 nm, (3-TCP mean particle size 11.64 pm). In fact, particle size has been shown to affect total porosity since as described\n99/1/A\n90/10/A\n80/20/A\n90/10/A\n80/20/A\n4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000\t500\n0\t12\t3\nEnergy (keV)\n99/1/A\n99/1\n80/20 [\nFig. 4.

[55], the formation of agglomerates is dependent on the application of higher forces to compact nanoparticles [55]. Therefore, since no forces were applied to form compact nanoparticle aggregates the more space occupied by HA powders in 80/20 scaffolds, presents higher interfacial voids, and thus, increased total porosity. It is also important to emphasize that an increased HA concentration increases the viscosity of the slurry, a fact that will lead to highly porous materials after sintering as reported by Sopyan et al. [56]. Thus the increasing porosity in the 80/20 scaffold in comparison with the other formulations may also be correlated with the higher viscosity promoted by HA.\nRegarding the scaffold porosity after the coating procedure, a slight decrease (5%) was observed for the 80/20/A template in comparison with the respective uncoated scaffold. Even though, this scaffold was also the most porous in comparison with all other coated ones (Fig. 2). The existence of pores is fundamental as it promotes nutrient intake, as well as, interactions between the p-TCP/HA template and bone cells. The establishment of this microenvironment promotes cell attachment, migration and proliferation in a 3D area [57-59]. Apart from pore size, pore interconnectivity is also a desirable characteristic due to its important influence on cell proliferation and differentiation [60]. In fact, interconnected pores facilitate the formation of vascular networks within the 3D scaffolds and provide channeling pathways for biofluids [61]. These biofluids promote the adsorption of Ca2+ and PO4- ions throughout the biomaterial, creating an HA-like layer [10]. This layer establishes an interface between the implant and the 9 surrounding bone tissues and stimulates osteoblast cell activity, increasing the deposition of bone matrix in the defect area. Additionally the formation of this layer increases the osteoconductivity and osteointegration, further contributing for the bone mineralization [17].\nAchieving equilibrium between scaffold porosity and adequate mechanical strength, is a demanding objective for the production of scaffolds, as it was taken into consideration in this study. The mechanical behavior of the 3D scaffolds was characterized by analyzing their resistance to compression, followed by an estimation of the values of fracture toughness and Young's modulus. Through the analysis of Fig. 3 it is possible to visualize that the compressive strength, the fracture toughness and the Young's modulus of the 80/20 scaffold are higher than the values of the 90/10 and 99/1 scaffolds. With increase of porosity (99/1 to 80/20) there is an increase in the mechanical strength by 2 times. This improvement in mechanical compression strength is due to the increasing densification of the walls due to the increase of the amount of HA. This is also corroborated by the increased material stiffness (highest Young's modulus). After coating the scaffolds with a 2% alginate solution their mechanical properties improved, with the 80/20/A maintaining better mechanical resistance to compression, resistance to fracture and elasticity modulus than the other coated 3D structures. Accordingly, it was previously described that an increase in the volume fraction of alginate from 1 to 3% results in an improvement of the compressive modulus [62]. So, it is noticeable that the most porous structures (80/20 and 80/20/A) are also those with better mechanical properties, when compared to both the uncoated and coated 90/10 or 99/1 scaffolds. These findings are likely correlated with the fact that the 80/20 and 80/20/A scaffolds have higher amounts of HA and lower quantities of p-TCP, in comparison to the other manufactured scaffolds. This is consistent with a study performed by Shiota, T. et al., that revealed that high amounts of p-TCP are responsible for a decrease in scaffold strength resistance [63]. Comparing the mechanical properties of 80/20/A scaffold with those presented by the natural cancellous bone, it is possible to observe that this scaffold is the most promising for therapeutic applications, among the scaffolds produce herein (Table 2) [64-66].\nThe different scaffolds produced by FRM were then characterized by FT1R spectroscopy. The stretching bands obtained between 500 and 600 cm-1 for the manufactured structures are characteristic of\nthe PO- ions present in both p-TCP and the HA powder (Fig. 4A). The stretching of the -OH groups was also observed (3571 cm-1 and libration mode at \u00ab630 cm-1). This particular band intensity is higher in all the synthesized scaffolds, since it is the end result of the cumulative contribution of both HA and p-TCP (Fig. 4A). 1n addition, the stretching bands observed at \u00ab1415 and 1450 cm-1 are attributed to a B type apatite [67]. Furthermore, EDS analysis of the scaffolds shows that the chemical composition of all the alginate coated formulations is very similar in terms of phosphate and calcium (Fig. 4C).\nN.S.\n1 1 *\t<r\t\t\n\tII N.S.\t1\n' *\t\t1\n1\tII\tI\nN.S.\ni------i\nN.S\ni-------'\nN.S.\n\u00ab----------------\u00ab\n\u25a1\tK+\n\u25a0 K-\nsa 80/20\n\u25a1\t80/20/A\n1\t1 * *\t\n1\t\tii\ti N.S.\n1 *\ti *\n1\t11 1\nN.S.\ni\ti\n43 w\n>\nZJ\n\u25a1\tK+\n\u25a0\tK-\n\u25a0\t90/10\n\u25a1\t90/10/A\n* * *\n1\t\t\t\n1\tII\t1 N.S\t\t\n1\tN.S.\t\t\u2014\t'\nr\tu\ti\t\t\nn\"s.\t\u2019 N~S\nQ\nO\n\u25a1\tK+\n\u25a0\tK-\n\u25a0\t99/1\n\u25a1\t99/1 /A\nTime of Culture (Days)\nFig. 5.

Analysis of the biological properties of the scaffolds\nSubsequently, the biological performance of the porous (3-TCP/HA structures was also evaluated. For this purpose, human osteoblast cells were cultured in the 3D scaffolds for up to 14 days and their metabolic activity evaluated at the indicated time points (Fig. 5). The results obtained revealed that osteoblast metabolic activity when cultured in the presence of all the scaffolds was higher than 70% during the 14 days of analysis, indicating that the 3D bioceramics are biocompatible. Among all the uncoated scaffolds, the 80/20 formulation was the one that presented higher biocompatibility along the assay and comparatively to 90/10 and 99/1 scaffolds. Cells presented higher metabolic activity in the presence of alginate coated-p-TCP/HA scaffolds than in contact with uncoated scaffolds (p &lt;0.05). The 80/20/A structure was the one for which cells presented the higher viability, being close to the value presented by the negative control for all culture days (approximately 100%).\nTo further characterize cellular adhesion both on the surface and inside the scaffold, SEM analysis was performed and it showed that osteoblasts were able to adhere preferably inside the pores of the bioceramic scaffolds, either coated (Fig. 6) or not (Supplementary Fig. 2) with the natural polymer. Interestingly, after the first day in contact with the scaffolds, osteoblasts were already attached and spread across the 3D structures, presenting a round shape configuration, with some cytoplasm extensions towards the substrate. At day 7, and predominantly after 14 days of culture, cells cultured in all the different structures started to present a typical osteoblastic morphology,\nshowing a smooth arrangement with more lamellipodia connecting to surrounding osteoblast, beginning to form a continuous cell layer. For all the uncoated and coated (3-TCP/HA scaffolds, the number of osteoblasts appeared to increase along time, with cells establishing connection areas between them. SEM analysis was also important to investigate whether alginate was or not occluding the pores of the coated scaffolds and if cells were still able to migrate within these scaffolds. As depicted in Fig. 6, alginate did not block the pores, but instead created additional biocompatible substrates, changed the roughness and microtopography of the scaffolds surface, which contributed to further increase osteoblast adhesion and migration. These results are further emphasized by the CLSM analysis during the various stages of osteoblast contact with the scaffolds (Fig. 7). In fact, as shown in Fig. 7, during osteoblast contact with the alginate-coated 3D scaffolds, cells were able to adhere and proliferate in all bioceramic formulations, emphasizing their biocompatibility and suitable physicochemical properties to promote osteoblast adhesion. These findings were also observed for the uncoated bioceramic scaffolds. Furthermore, at days 7 and 14 it is clear that osteoblasts migrate into the porous network during the time course of incubation. A visual analysis of the orthogonal slices of the scaffolds also clearly demonstrates that osteoblasts are spread across the entire scaffold and are also located inside the scaffold pores.\nTo further visualize the cytoplasmic morphology and localization of the osteoblasts that were proliferating on the 3D hybrid scaffolds an immunocytochemistry analysis of (3-actin was performed. As the CLSM 3D reconstruction images demonstrate, osteoblasts present their characteristic cytoplasmic morphology for all scaffolds (Fig. 8).\nFig. 6. SEM micrographs of osteoblast morphology in the presence of the different \u00a3>-TCP/HA/alginate scaffolds. SEM images were used to visualize osteoblasts on the surface of the 80/20/A (A, B and C), 90/10/A (D, E and F) and 99/1/A(G,H and I)3D scaffolds, at culture days 1 (A, D and G), 7 (B,E and H) and 14 (C, F and I). Scale bars correspond to 20 pm.\nIn addition, color coded depth analysis of the alginate coated structures clearly shows that osteoblasts are capable of migrating and attaching into deep sections of the scaffolds with some cells being localized up to 300 pm within the pores (Fig. 8). This is a relevant finding since the deposition of bone matrix inside the scaffold will eventually fill the bone defect while the scaffold is biodegraded, restoring the structure and function of the native bone.\nTogether, our results demonstrate that the produced (3-TCP/HA structures are highly porous, hydrophilic, biocompatible and resistant to compression, improvements particularly achieved for the 80/20 structure. It was also shown that a mixture of (3-TCP and HA, has the benefit of combining the bioactivity of (3-TCP and the stability of HA. Moreover, higher amounts of HA increased the scaffold mechanical strength, while smaller amounts of (3-TCP led to an increase of structure porosity. Besides, this study also reveals that the combination of both (3-TCP and HA improves the biological and mechanical properties, in comparison with previously developed scaffolds comprised of (3-TCP or HA alone [68-70]. In fact, the combination of these bioceramics originated 3D porous and bioactive structures with desirable osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. Our novel approach involving an additional alginate coating further improves the scaffold mechanical, physicochemical and biological properties, as this natural biopolymer bridges the gap between the required material properties and bioactivity for therapeutic applications. Overall, the manipulation of bioceramic-polymer relative ratios largely influenced all the 3D scaffold properties and led to the\nmanufacture of a particularly improved formulation with suitable characteristics for repair (Table 3, 80/20/A formulation). The role of alginate in the improvement of the mechanical properties is even more evident when comparing the scaffolds herein presented with those produced by Ebrahimi, M. et al. [31], which describes the production of p-TCP and HA scaffolds coated with collagen. An analysis of both types of scaffolds reveals the superior contribution of alginate, when compared to collagen, for the improvement of the scaffold mechanical strength and because, unlike collagen, alginate does not represent a risk of disease transmission [43]. Considering that the in vivo performance of p-TCP and HA has already been tested in humans [40,41], from this standpoint we envision that the addition of this polymer may actually improve the clinical outcome of these biomaterials.\n4.\tConclusions\nIn this work we describe the manufacture of 3D tunable porous scaffolds for bone regeneration by using a cost-effective and reproducible technique. Our results revealed that by optimizing the ratios of different bioceramic composites in the scaffolds the physicochemical and biological properties of these 3D constructs could be improved. In addition, the method employed for template production, allows the synthesis of scaffolds with rough topographies, micro-and macro-pores that are homogeneously distributed in the scaffold 3D volume. Furthermore, in order to improve the overall performance\nFig. 7. Osteoblasts are able to attach to the surface of the different scaffolds.

This inclusion greatly enhanced both the mechanical and biological properties of the scaffolds. In fact, osteoblast adhesion, migration and proliferation in contact with the coated scaffolds emphasize their suitability for regenerative medicine. To the best of our knowledge this was the first time that this combination of these biomaterials was used to manufacture 3D porous scaffolds, which resulted in unique structures with desirable biological, mechanical and physical properties that will promote bone regeneration. In a near future these hybrid bioceramic-polymeric composites will be\nTable 3\nSummary of physicochemical and biological properties of the manufactured scaffolds.\nProperties scaffold\tHydrophilicity\tPorosity\tMechanical strength\tBiocompatibility\n80/20\t+\t++++++\t+++++\t++++ +\n80/20/A\t+++ +\t++++ +\t++++++\t++++++\n90/10\t+ +\t++++\t+++\t+\n90/10/A\t+++++\t++ +\t+++ +\t++\n99/1\t+++\t++\t+ +\t++ +\n99/1/A\t++++++\t+\t+\t++++\n\u201c+\u201d to \u201c++++++\u201d: symbol-based grade, indicating improvement of the scaffolds properties.\nimplanted in whole animal models with small and large bone defects, in order to evaluate their bone regenerative performance.\n5.\tAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank to Eng.
