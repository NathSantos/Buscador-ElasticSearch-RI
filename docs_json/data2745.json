Two of the representative species are Phytophthora infestans, which causes late blight of potato, and Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes chestnut ink disease, responsible for losses on sweet chestnut production in Europe. Genome sequencing efforts have been focused on the study of three species: P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum. Phytophthora infestans has been developed as the model specie for the genus, possessing excellent genetic and genomics resources including genetic maps, BAC libraries, and EST sequences. Our research team is trying to sequence the genome of P. cinnamomi in order to gain a better understanding of this oomycete, to study changes in plant-pathogen relationships including those resulting from climate change and trying to decrease the pathogen's impact on crops and plants in natural ecosystems worldwide. We present here a preliminary report of partially sequenced genomic DNA from P. cinnamomi encoding putative protein-coding sequences and tRNAs. Database analysis reveals the presence of genes conserved in oomycetes.\nKeywords: DNA library, oomycetes, Phytophthora cinnamomi, tRNA.\nRESUMO\nOs oomicetas causam enormes perdas na agricultura e degrada\u00e7\u00e3o generalizada em \u00e1reas de crescimento natural, sendo respons\u00e1veis pela morte de milhares de \u00e1rvores por ano.

They include more than 60 species of the genus Phytophthora. The best kwon potato late blight disease, which is caused by the fungus P. infestans, results in considerable loss of potato crop yield worldwide (Judelson et al., 2009). P. cinnamomi, a destructive and widespread soil-borne pathogen that infects woody plant hosts, has been estimated to directly affect over 2000 of the 9000 native plant species in the south west of Western Australia. In the north east of Portugal and in the Spanish adjoin region, P. cinnamomi has been reported to affect chestnuttree (Castanea sativa) and cherry-tree (Prunus avium) (Martins et al., 2014b). Fundamental insights into the pathogenesis of fungal surface infections and the strategy of fungal invasion of a host can be achieved by identifying the genes of P. infestans and P. cinnamomi that are expressed during standard lab conditions and during infection. This would help to establish the genes involved in the pathogenic processes.\nThe environmental changes associated with invasion and spread in the host demand specific adaptations. Indeed, it has been shown that P. infestans and P. cinnamomi express specific genes at certain stages of infection. It is unlikely that a single pathogenicity program would be sufficient to account for the range of infections that can be caused by these pathogens. A permanent interplay exists between the host and the pathogen that regulates the transcriptional profile of P. infestans and P. cinnamomi; in this scenario, gene expression of P. infestans and P. cinnamomi is regulated by dynamic changes in relation to the environment.\nDetermining which genes are expressed during the different stages and types of infections is of essential importance in understanding the biological and physiological responses of those fungal pathogens to their environment (Choupina et al, 2014). While many data exist about the P. infestans and P. sojae genome, those related to P. cinnamomi are scanty. Genomic DNA libraries are a standard procedure which has been used to sequencing genes in several organisms (Kanjanawattanawong et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2014). By digestion of genomic DNA from P. cinnamomi we have constructed a DNA library\nwith an insert size average of 2-12 kb in Escherichia coli. Six clones comprising 30000-40000 bp were sequenced, finding 12 putative protein-coding sequences and tree tRNAs.\nDatabase analysis reveals the presence of conserved genes in oomycetes. Our group, using asymmetric PCR, have identified and characterized the structural proteins Actin1, Actin2 and Tubulin1 (GenBank: AM412175.1, AM412176.1, AM412177.1) (Martins et al., 2013), and some other proteins involved in mechanisms of infection by P. cinnamomi namely endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (GenBank: AM259651.1) (complete cds) (Meirinho et al., 2010); endo-glucanase (GenBank: AJ964942.1) (partial cds) (unpublished results); glucanase inhibitor protein (GIP) (GenBank: AM259384.1) (complete cds) (Martins et al., 2014a); necrosisinducing Phytophthora protein 1 (NPP1) (GenBank: AM403130.1) (complete cds) (unpublished results) (Gijzen and Nurnberger, 2006) and transglutaminase (GenBank:\tAM403129.1)\n(unpublished results) (Martins et al., 2014b; Yu et al., 2008). By standard PCR with DNA of P. cinnamomi and primers designed by homologous sequences from different Phytophthora species, our group also sequenced ribosomal RNA subunits (GenBank: AJ421265.2 and AJ457835.2) (unpublished results).\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nBiological material\nPhytophthora cinnamomi PR120 strain was grown in potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium with cellophane at 28\u00b0C for 1 week. Total DNA was obtained from mycelial mats, mycelia was ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total DNA was extracted by standard DNA extraction methods (Reinoso et al., 2005).\nGene library construction\nThe genomic DNA library was prepared by digestion with HindIII, which generated fragments in the range of 2-12 kb. The fragments were inserted into the corresponding site of the pBluescript KS+ vector. The recombinant plasmids were used to transform the E. coli XL1 Blue strain. Transformants were selected on LB media supplemented with 100 pg/ml ampicillin and six clones were taken randomly for further sequencing (Sambrook et al., 1989). Sequencing reactions were conducted using universal and reverse primers with the ABI 377\nClone No.\tGene\tLength (bp)\tHomology to...(%)\n1\tPcRBP14\t187\tP. infestans ribosomal protein L14 (95.0) P. infestans ribosomal protein L14 (93.0) Saprolegnia feraz ribossomal protein L14 (80.0) Methylococcus capsulatus ribossomal protein L14 (55.0)\n1\tPcRBP5\t534\tP. infestans ribosomal protein L5 (89.0) P. infestans ribosomal protein L5 (89.0) Thalassiosirapseudonana ribossomal protein L5 (35.0) Malawimonas jakobiformis ribossomal protein L5 (35.0)\n2\tPcPLPl\t5354\tP. infestans pol polyprotein (51.0) P. infestans putative polyprotein (56.0) P. infestans putative polyprotein (40.0) Hordeum vulgare polyprotein (34.0)\n2\tPcHPl\t1388\tRhodobacter sphaeroides chromosome segregation protein SMC (26.0) Erythrobacter litorales hypothetical protein (24.0) Oceanicola granulosus hypothetical protein (30.0)\n3\tPcPLP2\t6473\tStrongylocentrotuspurpuratus similar to Zn-finger, CCHC type and RNA directed DNA polymerase and integrase, catalytic domain protein (29.0-30.0) S. purpuratus similar to retrovirus-related pol polyprotein from tansposon (29.0) Schistosoma mansoni TPA pol polyprotein (28.0)\n4\tPcHP2\t666\tAspergillus nidulans hypothetical protein AN5649.2 (25.0) Canis familiaris cardiac titin isoform N2BA (26.0) Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C25A1.10b (21.0)\n4\tPcUPLl\t1812\tAnopheles gambiae ENSANGP00000025653 (36.0) Arabidopis thaliana UPL1 (ubiquitin-protein ligase 1) (34.0) A. thaliana UPL1 (34.0) Mus musculus Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (34.0)\n5\tPcPLP3\t594\tP. infestans putative polyprotein (36.0) P. infestans pol protein (25.0) C. familiaris similar to serine/arginine repetitive matrix isoform 2 (34.0) Homo sapiens serine/arginine repetitive matrix 1 (35.0)\n5\tPcHP3\t1062\tPan troglodytes hypothetical protein XP 531346 (31.0) H. sapiens RNA binding protein (23.0) Streptomyces aureofaciens unknown (26.0) C. elegans hypothetical protein H39E23.3 (26.0)\n6\tPcGLP\t942\tTheileria parva hypothetical protein TP01 0256 (32.0) Gibberella zeae hypothetical protein FG10731.1 (32.0) Cryptosporidium parvum 60 kDa glycoprotein (29.0) C. hominis glycoprotein (27.0) C. parvum 60 kDa glycoprotein (27.0)\n6\tPcPGP\t1284\tListeria monocytogenes putative peptidoglycan bound protein (LPXTG motif) (32.0) L. monocytogenes probable peptidoglycan bound protein (32.0) Bacillus clausii hypothetical protein (35.0) Jannaschia sp mucin-associated surface protein (39.0)\n6\tPcHP4\t726\tCryptococcus neoformans conserved hypothetical protein (22.0) Bos taurus similar to Rb-inducible coiled coil protein 1 (22.0) Plasmodium berghei hypothetical protein PB405340.00.0 (26.0) C. parvum hypothetical protein cgd4 4490 (36.0)\nsequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), using the Taq DyeDeoxy\u2122 Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit as supplied by the manufacturer.

The quality of the final sequence was checked by visual inspection of the sequencing profiles at each position on each DNA strand. The sequence was considered correct only when an unambiguous reading of each nucleotide on each strand was achieved.\nComputer-assisted sequence analysis\nAssembly of the sequences was done with the SeqMan program of the DNASTAR program package (DNASTAR Ltd.).

ORFs were named with the prefix Pc (P. cinnamomi). Searches for homologies were done using the BLAST or FASTA programs. Mult iple-sequence alignments were obtained\nusing the CLUSTAL program. In addition, a Blast analysis was performed on PhytophthoraDB database available on http://phytophthora. vbi.vt.edu/browse/ index.html and in the Phytophthora Functional Genomics Database available at http://www.pfgd.org/. Sequences of predicted proteins were also scanned for Motif Scan.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSequence analysis\nPlasmids 1 to 6 contained inserts between 2246 (clone No.1) and 9218 bp (clone No.4), which after sequencing, covered 38,146 bp altogether.\nClone No.1 has 2246 bp which 750 bp correspond to two possible ORFs, both have identity with known proteins; A+T content is 79.61% (Figure 1, Table 1). In addition, two Glycine tRNA and one Tyrosine tRNA were detected using the software tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/ tRNAscan-SE). They have a size of 71, 72 and 83 nucleotides, respectively.\nClone No.2 is a 7060 bp sequence, with 6742 bp corresponding to two possible ORFs. The first ORF (PcPLPT) has 5 introns and has identity with known proteins. The A+T content is 42.58% (Figure 1, Table 1).\nClone No.3 is a 6758 bp sequence, with 6483 bp corresponding to one possible ORF (presenting 3 introns) with homology to known proteins; A+T content is 44.48% (Figure 1, Table 1).\nClone No.4 has 9218 bp which 2921 bp correspond to two possible ORFs. The first one is partial and the second has 2 introns with identity to known proteins; A+T content is 44.37% (Figure 1, Table 1).\nClone No.5 has 7422 bp which 1735 bp correspond to two possible ORFs. The first is partial with identity to known proteins; A+T content is 42.29% (Figure 1, Table 1).\nClone No.6 has 5442 bp which 2949 bp correspond to three possible ORFs, the two first have identity with known proteins; A+T content is 43.68% (Figure 1, Table 1).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough sequencing is partial, 0.05% of the total genome, it may be indicative of some aspects of the genomic organization of P. cinnamomi, which allow to provide the following conclusions: the first sequence (Clone No.1) has a 20,39% GC content and presents two coding sequences from mitochondrial DNA (one of them partial) and tree tRNAs. The other five sequences have a 56.52% GC content and present 10 putative coding sequences (three of them partial). The 12 coding sequences (3 of them containing at least one intron) cover 47% of the total sequence. Eight sequences have similarity with known genes of some bacteria of Stramenopiles lineage and fungal. The number of introns varies from 1 to 5. Intron lengths are quite variable from 41 to 146 nucleotides and conserved splicing sequence elements were found. Intron boundaries shows the canonical splice site 5'GT ... AG3' (Kamoun, 2003).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Project COMBATINTA/SP2.P11/02 Interreg IIIA - Cross-Border Cooperation Spain-Portugal, financed by The European Regional Development Found, supported this work.\nREFERENCES\nChoupina, A.; Estevinho, L. &amp; Martins, I.
