Introduction \n\nAs a consequence of the stock market crash in 1987, and as markets became more \n\nvolatile, financial institutions were more interested in risk management. In this decade \n\nmany institutions became more leveraged which led to an increase of bankruptcies. \n\nMarkets turned unstable and measures to represent the market risk were then required \n\n(see Jorion, 1997). \n\nThese events led regulatory authorities to impose Risk-Based-Capital to control \n\nfinancial risks (see Dimson and Marsh, 1995 and Wagster, 1996). \n\nThe risk managers wanted to know: How can we quantify risk and how much capital do \n\nthey need to cover the risks under your business? \n\nThere are several measures to quantify risk, namely: standard deviation, semi-standard \n\ndeviation, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Tailed Loss (ETL).  In spite of the strengths \n\nand weaknesses of all the risk measures, VaR is the preferred one by the financial \n\ninstitutions, regulators, non-financial corporations and asset managers, as discussed by \n\nJorion (1997).  \n\nIn 1995 Basel Accords imposed VaR as the standard risk measure adopted by the \n\nfinancial industry for exposure of the market risk.  \n\nThe advantage of this market risk metric is its easiness to be presented as well as to be \n\nunderstood by most of people. Additionally, it can be compared across different markets \n\nand different exposures. The VaR measures the expected maximum loss in value (or \n\npercentage) of a portfolio for a given period with some probability associated. For \n\nexample,              . This means that we are        confident that the loss \n\nwill not exceed   euros (or another currency) in the next   days. The significance level \n\n    is usually below 0.05 (5% percentile). RiskMetric\n1\n uses this percentile, but Basel \n\nAccords set 1% for the significance level. The       is the confidence level. The   is \n\ndenominated as the risk horizon, meaning  the number of trading days ahead for which \n\nwe want to measure the risk of Profit and Losses (P&amp;L) distribution. Basel Accords set \n\n     (two weeks). Lastly, the parameter   is the VaR, which can be presented as a \n\npercentage or an amount. \n\n                                                           \n1\n Commercial implementation of a VaR measurement system developed by J.P. Morgan (1996). \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n2 \n\n \n\nThis is a critical matter for financial institutions because it requires a good evaluation of \n\nVaR to predict possible losses and measure the risk accurately. The most important \n\n\u00abinput\u00bb for VaR estimation is the volatility. As volatility is not directly observable, \n\nthere is lots of research attempting to deal with this problem. A good volatility forecast \n\nis very important for a good estimation of the portfolio risk and it may be interesting \n\nand profitable to know how a certain variable will evolve in the future.  \n\nThe aim of this dissertation is to analyze and compare the different approaches to \n\npredict volatility in order to provide better estimation for computing Value-at-Risk.  The \n\nfocus will be answering the question: what is the best volatility model? \n\nThis thesis will use stock indexes all around the world, the most important exchange \n\nrates and two particular commodities: gold and oil. The data set includes daily returns \n\nfrom January 2, 2000 to December 31, 2011. It is important to remind that our sample \n\ncontains one of the most important crisis that remains to these days: subprime crisis. So, \n\nit might be interesting to see if there are any differences in the performance of the \n\nmodels during the periods of high volatility. To do this, we will divide the sample into \n\ntwo sub periods (before crisis and during the crisis) to see if there are differences in the \n\nmodels\u2019 performance. The VaR will be estimated based on six different methodologies \n\nin which four of them only differ in the choice of the GARCH model. \n\nThis dissertation is organized as follow: Section 2 describes parts of the existing \n\nliterature under the methodology; the theoretical background is described in section 3; \n\non section 4 the data and methodology are presented. Finally, in section 5 the main \n\nfindings are discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n3 \n\n \n\n2. Literature Review \n\nAccording to Christoffersen, Hahn and Inoue (2001), two important developments to \n\nrisk management have occurred in the recent past: Engle (1982) developed the first \n\nmodels to measure and forecast volatility and J.P.Morgan (1996) introduced \n\nRiskMetrics. The latter remained as a benchmark for measuring market risk and led to \n\nimprovements made by Jorion (1997), Duffie and Pan (1997) and Dowd (1998). \n\nHopper (1996) defined Value-at-Risk as the expected largest loss that a portfolio is \n\nlikely to suffer during all but truly exceptional periods. More precisely, VaR is the \n\nmaximum loss that an institution can be confident to lose in a certain fraction of time \n\nover a particular period.  \n\nVaR can be defined by: \n\n   \n\n    [       ]    \n\n                                                                                                          \n\nwhere     is the log return and   the significant level. \n\nVaR became the most popular measure to quantify the market risk and determine capital \n\nrequest because it is easier to communicate, it lets different financial markets to be \n\ncompared (which is useful due to internationalization and diversification), and it is \n\npossible to evaluate a portfolio in terms of risk-return relation.  \n\nThere are different approaches for computing VaR. Determining what it is the best \n\nmethodology for VaR estimation becomes an empirical question. The choice may \n\ndepend on the number of underlying assets, their type and the exact objective of the \n\ncalculation. VaR estimation methods are usually divided into parametric and non-\n\nparametric categories. Parametric methods are based on statistical assumptions about \n\nthe risk factor distribution while non-parametric methods are based on simulations (see \n\nAmman and Reich, 2001). \n\nAccording to Carol (2008), there are three main methodologies to estimate the VaR: \n\n1. Parametric Linear \n\n2. Historical Simulation \n\n3. Monte Carlo Simulation \n\n(1) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n4 \n\n \n\nRisk managers prefer to use non-parametric methods especially Historical Simulation \n\n(HS) because it is the easiest to implement (Wiener, 1999) while Monte Carlo is the \n\nmost challenging method. In fact, almost three quarters of banks use Historical \n\nSimulation (see Perignon and Smith, 2006). \n\nThis method was introduced by Boudoukh et al. (1998) and Barone-Adesi et al. (1999). \n\nUnlike the parametric method, this approach makes few distribution assumptions and it \n\nis relatively simple to implement (see Danielsson and Vries, 1997; Dowd, 1998; \n\nManganelli and Engle, 2001). The idea is simply to use historical market data to \n\nestimate VaR for the current portfolio. It does not make any assumption about the \n\nparametric form of the returns\u2019 distribution and does not require the estimation of \n\nvolatility and correlations since the changes in the portfolio over time has all the \n\ninformation that we need to compute the VaR. This approach takes into account the fat \n\ntails stylized fact of the empirical returns\u2019 distribution, as the data \u201cspeaks\u201d by itself. \n\nThus, Historical Simulation virtually applies to any type of instrument and, unlike the \n\nparametric method, it is not limited to linear portfolios\n2\n (see Carol, 2008). Other \n\nadvantage is the inclusion of risk factors dynamic behavior which is assumed to be very \n\nsimple and sometimes unrealistic in the parametric form. \n\nThe major drawback associated with Historical Simulation is the assumption that the \n\nfuture P&amp;L distribution will be identical to the past distribution as data is considered \n\nequally relevant. The method assumes that history repeats itself. Data can contain events \n\nthat will not appear in the future, so they have no relevance for the sample (see \n\nManganelli and Engle, 2001). In this case the sample size is a crucial choice because it \n\nmust be large (it is common to use more than five years of historical data). Sometimes, \n\nthere are not enough available data especially when new assets are introduced to the \n\nportfolio. In addition, when facing high confidence levels, it is important to have a long \n\nsample but looking further into the past will decrease the relevance in the VaR \n\nestimation because the empirical distribution will reflect less the market condition. \n\nAnother problem is that Historical Simulation approach assumes that returns are \n\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and so it does not allow for time-varying \n\nvolatility (see Sarma, 2003).  \n\n                                                           \n2\n Daily changes in the portfolio value are linearly dependent on daily changes in market variable. \n\nPortfolios that contain options are non-linear.  \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n5 \n\n \n\nThis paper focuses in this method. The main purpose is to show how these drawbacks \n\ncan be overcome using volatility updating.  \n\nAccording to Dowd (1998), a convenient solution to these issues is to use weighted \n\nHistorical Simulation which gives lower importance to observations that lie further in \n\nthe past. \n\nThe major problem with equally weighted data is that extreme events (positive or \n\nnegative) can influence the VaR estimate. So, Boudoukl, et. al. (1998) introduced the \n\nhybrid approach which combines \u201cThe Best of Both Worlds\u201d: Risk Metrics introduced \n\nby J.P.Morgan (1996) and Historical Simulation. In the hybrid approach, instead of \n\ngiving the same weight to all data whether it happened in a nearly or a longer past, it \n\ngives more importance to recent observations, assuming that recent volatilities have \n\nmore influence in the volatility forecast than older ones. The weight assigned to the \n\nobservations decreases exponentially over time and depends from the smoothing \n\nconstant ? that ranges between 0 and 1. This Exponential Weighted Moving Average \n\n(EWMA) is used in RiskMetrics to update the underlying variance-covariance matrix. \n\nAs was said before, the Historical Simulation requires a large sample of financial \n\ndatabase. The problem related with this is that market conditions change while the time \n\ngoes by. For example, if the volatility of a stock had been stable but in the last two years \n\nwas very high, the volatility we expect so see in the present will be underestimated if \n\nyou give to both periods the same importance.  \n\nTo overcome this problem Duffie and Pan (1997) and Hull and White (1998) \n\nrecommend a volatility adjustment method. This methodology was designed to weight \n\nthe returns in a way to adjust their volatility to the current volatility. To do this we can \n\nuse the EWMA or Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity \n\n(GARCH). \n\nThe GARCH model has several advantages in relation to EWMA as will be explained \n\nin the next paragraphs. \n\nAs mentioned before the assumption that returns are i.i.d. is very unrealistic, so the \n\nvolatility and correlation forecasts that came out of these idea are also mistaken. The \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n6 \n\n \n\nfinancial data shows volatility clustering\n3\n behavior (see Mandelbrot, 1963 and Fama, \n\n1965). Engle (1982) introduced autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) \n\nand Bollerslev (1986) and Taylor (1986) its generalization (GARCH) that capture the \n\nvolatility clustering effect. The GARCH model takes into consideration the dynamic \n\nproperties of returns, i.e., the conditional variance is a function that includes past \n\ninnovations (see Angelidis, Benos and Degiannakis, 2004).  \n\nThe simplest GARCH(1,1) model is given by: \n\n  \n         \n\n       \n  \n\nwhere   \n  (conditional variance) is a function given by the square of past errors (    \n\n  ) \n\nand past conditional variance (    \n ). It is required that conditional variance will be \n\nalways positive, so there are some restrictions on the parameters:              . \n\nThe sum of parameters         measures the persistence. If this sum is close to one, \n\nvolatility shocks are quite persistent over time, if it is minor than one the variance is \n\nstationary and bigger than one the variance is explosive. \n\nThe GARCH model is applied in financial data series because can modelize the \n\nempirical distribution of financial returns such as volatility clustering, excess kurtosis \n\n(fatter tails than normal distribution) and heteroscedasticity conditional errors. \n\nThe risk metric technique mentioned before uses a particular autoregressive moving \n\naverage process, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) which is a special \n\ncase of the GARCH model. In this technique  =0 and ?+?=1:  \n\n  \n       \n\n           \n  \n\nJ.P.Morgan (1996) considers ? equal to 0.94 for daily data and 0.97 for monthly data \n\nand assumes that standardized residuals are normally distributed.  \n\nThe advantage of using GARCH instead of EWMA is that we do not make a subjective \n\nchoice of the value for the exponential smoothing constant ? because the parameters of \n\nthe GARCH model are estimated from the sample data. \n\n                                                           \n3\n Large change in the price of an asset are followed by other large change and small changes are often \n\nfollowed by small change. \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n7 \n\n \n\nGARCH is a symmetric model, which means that positive and negative shocks have the \n\nsame impact on volatility, but according to Bollerslev et al. (1992) this is not observed \n\nin financial returns. Moreover, the price variation is negatively correlated with volatility \n\nvariation, i.e., when the asset price rises up the variance of the return gets down. These \n\nfacts along with periods of persistent high volatility, which are followed by periods of \n\npersistent low volatility, were called Leverage Effect by Black (1976). \n\nDue to these facts were developed extensions on the GARCH model to capture these \n\nasymmetric effects in the financial data.  \n\nThe most common extensions in use are the GJR-GARCH developed by Glosten, \n\nJagannathan and Runkle (1993), E-GARCH presented by Nelson (1991) and A-PARCH \n\nintroduced by Ding, Granger and Engle (1993).   \n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to test which method is more appropriate to estimate \n\nthe volatility. This can be done using various methods such as backtesting, stress testing \n\nor other techniques.  \n\nBacktesting is a method used to validate a model and it basically verifies if the actual \n\nlosses exceed or not the expectations, i.e., we have to compare the VaR that is given by \n\nthe method with the portfolio return. This reality checks (Jorion, 1997) are used by risk \n\nmanagers who need to see if their VaR forecast is good. Backtesting is also crucial to \n\nthe Basel Committee which uses this technique to understand what VaR models they \n\nwill let the financial institutions use to estimate the capital requirements. Is necessary to \n\nverify if the models are appropriate to predict the losses, ensuring that the required \n\ncapital is sufficient to cover potential losses. The Basel Committee imposed a \n\nbacktesting to all VaR models, where the actual losses cannot exceed four times the \n\nprojected losses, considering an annual sample. \n\nThere are some different testing methods that have been proposed for backtesting. The \n\nstatistical tests that will be used to do the model validation are the Kupiec test (1995) \n\nwhich examines the frequency of returns exceeded by VaR estimates and Christoffersen \n\ntest (1998) that takes into account the independence of exceptions. This characteristic is \n\nimportant to notice, since a good model is indeed able to react quickly to any change in \n\nvolatility. This subject is very important in the actual market environment where \n\nvolatile prices are likely to increase and investors seek for a risky portfolio. \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n8 \n\n \n\nDespite its wide use in financial market and the acceptance of VaR as a risk measure, \n\nthe method has been broadly criticized. Therefore, we should expect many assumptions \n\nand simplifications. In addition, VaR only provides the maximum losses and do not \n\nestablishes any information about the exceeding that can occur. In fact, according to \n\nJorion (1997), the VaR measure is computed to provide the expected loss only under \n\nnormal conditions, which means that there are some deficiencies in estimating losses, \n\nwhen considering times of inconstant markets. For this reason, the backtesting it is very \n\nimportant.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n9 \n\n \n\n3. Technical Background  \n\nAs described in the introduction, the focus of this paper is related with the Historical \n\nSimulation since this is the method preferred by most banks as we do not have to make \n\nany assumption about the parametric form.  \n\nThe aim of this dissertation is to evaluate six methodologies of measuring Value-at-\n\nRisk, each of which differs in the form they treat volatility. The next chapter will \n\nprovide a summary of the technical background of the subject.   \n\n3.1 Definition VaR \n\nVaR can be defined as the expected maximum loss of a portfolio that will not exceed \n\nwith some confidence level       associated.  \n\n    [       ]    \n\nwhere ? is a significance level.  \n\nLet    be the price of a stock in the time  . The observed return is given by: \n\n               \n\nFor a holding period  , the return can be written by: \n\n                   \n\nIn the equation (4) the VaR does not require to be negative, since we are dealing with \n\nlosses which are a negative values by definition. \n\nVaR can be expressed by a percentage or by an absolute amount. To estimate the VaR \n\nin absolute amount, we can simply multiply the VaR by the portfolio value:  \n\n                               \n\nIt is possible to define VaR in terms of a probability density function         being \n\nrepresented by its percentile, i.e. the left part of the VaR function. In this case, it is \n\nnecessary to assume a return distribution, which is generally the normal distribution or \n\nstudent-t. \n\n \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n(7) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n10 \n\n \n\n3.2 Estimating Historical VaR \n\nThe              historical VaR, in value terms, is the   percentile of an empirical   \n\nday discounted P&amp;L distribution or return in the case when VaR is expressed as a \n\npercentage. \n\nThe computation of historical VaR is very simple as we can see: firstly, we must choose \n\na sample size   and compute the  -days returns for the assets. Following, we have to \n\nrank these returns from smallest to largest and obtain the cumulative distribution \n\nfunction (each observation has a probability of 1/n) or use the formula percentile in \n\nExcel. The historical VaR is the symmetric value that was computed before.  \n\nAccording to this method, the change in the risk portfolio is related with the historical \n\npast, as the past returns are used to predict future returns.   \n\n3.3 Equally Weighted Moving Average \n\nIn this method we give the same weight for all observations (1/n), old and recent. This \n\nis not the best approach, because it does not reflect the current market conditions as will \n\nbe explained bellow. This methodology, also known as Historical Approach has been \n\npopular since the 1990s but has a number of drawbacks.  \n\nThe historical VaR based on equally weighted returns depends on the choice of the \n\nsample size. In this method, this choice is the most important factor to estimate the \n\nVaR. For example, to estimate               we need at least 100 monthly observations \n\n(more or less 8 years of data), so as we look further into the past we find ghost features \n\nsuch as the golden years of finance and the most popular financial crisis. As the same \n\nweight was given to the returns any extreme market movement will have the same effect \n\non VaR estimative, whether it had happened yesterday or years ago. So, equally \n\nweighted returns are not advisable for any VaR model.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n11 \n\n \n\n3.4 Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages \n\nThe EWMA is the base model of risk software RiskMetric developed by J.P.Morgan \n\n(1996) which helped to popularize this method in the mid of 1990s. \n\nIn an exponentially weighted moving average approach, instead of giving the same \n\nweight for all of the observations, we put more weight in the most recent observations \n\nthrough the fix smoothing constant denoted by  . The choice of ? is subjective, it has to \n\nbe between 0 and 1, the larger the value of ? less we overweight recent observations and \n\nunderweight past returns.  \n\nFigure 1: Exponential Probability weight of return \n\nIn this figure we can see the lower the value of ? more we overweight recent observations and \n\nunderweight returns from the past. For example, using a decay factor of 0.94 we give a weight of 6% to \n\nthe last return while with a decay factor of 0.99 we give only 1%. As we can see observations over 2 or 3 \n\nmonths have little effect in VaR estimation. \n\n \n\nThe conditional variance is given by:  \n\n ?     \n \n          \n\n \n    \n\nWhere: \n\n    : Variance calculated in day t \n\n : Decay factor \n\n(8) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n12 \n\n \n\nThus, an extreme return that happened further into the past becomes less important in \n\nthe average. This approach does not suffer from the \u201cghost features\u201d. \n\nThe weight given to the observations exponentially decrease over time, and the weight \n\nattributed to latest observations versus older observations is measured through the \n\nsmoothing constant   . There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d decay factor. The problem with this \n\napproach is that a choice of   can influence the VaR estimation: if all largest returns \n\ntook place long time before the VaR estimate then higher values of ? will increase the \n\nvalue of VaR.  \n\n 3.5. GARCH Models \n\nThe Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model \n\ncaptures the volatility clustering of returns and is commonly used by financial \n\ninstitutions. \n\nThere are some extensions of GARCH Models such as GJR-GARCH, E-GARCH, A-\n\nPARCH that are described in this section. \n\n3.5.1 Symmetric normal GARCH model \n\nThe symmetric normal GARCH model assumes the dynamic behavior of the conditional \n\nvariance, i.e., the value of the period t is conditioned by past values. \n\nA general GARCH (q,p) model can be written as: \n\n          \n\n                        \n\n  \n    ?       \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n ?       \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\nwhere (9) is the conditional mean equation and (11) is the conditional variance equation. \n\nThe conditional mean equation (9) is written as a function of exogenous variables and \n\nan error term. \n\nThe conditional variance (11) is given as function of squared past errors (ARCH term) \n\nand the past conditional variances (GARCH term): \n\n(9) \n\n(10) \n\n(11) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n13 \n\n \n\nWhere: \n\n?   \u2013 intercept (constant term) \n\n?     \n  \u2013 error from the previous period  \n\n?     \n  \u2013 conditional variance from t-1  \n\n \n\nThe equation above is relative GARCH (q,p) which refers to the presence of the order \n\nGARCH term and the order ARCH term. An ordinary ARCH model is a special case of \n\nthis equation where the GARCH term is equal to zero. Generally, GARCH (1,1) is \n\nenough to describe the volatility of financial data.  \n\nThe sum of ARCH and GARCH coefficients (?+?) measure the rate of convergence, if \n\nthe sum is close to one, volatility shocks are quite persistent over time.  \n\nThis model is applied in financial data because it can capture the volatility clustering, \n\nexcess of kurtosis and heteroscedastic conditional errors. \n\nAs previously stated, this model is a symmetric one, so, the impact on the conditional \n\nvolatility of a positive shock is the same than a negative shock. Due to this, along with \n\nthe leverage effect (negative correlation between price variation and volatility variation) \n\nthe GARCH model extension has been developed to capture this behavior in financial \n\ndata. \n\n 3.5.2 GJR-GARCH \n\nIn this model was added an extra leverage parameter     . This binary variable aims at \n\nmodeling the asymmetry between positive and negative market shocks. A negative \n\nmarket shocks has a greater volatility impact than a positive market shock with the same \n\namplitude.  \n\n  \n    ?      \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n ?      \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n      \n      \n\nWhere      = {\n                \n               \n\n \n\n(12)\n\n) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n14 \n\n \n\nThe impact of positive shocks market are measured by the   parameter and the negative \n\nshocks are measured by    . If   > 0, there is leverage effect and negative shocks \n\ncause an increase in conditional volatility.  \n\n3.5.3 Exponential GARCH \n\nThis model does not impose constraints on the coefficients (not negative) because it \n\nformulates the conditional variance equation is in terms of the log of the variance. The \n\nlog can be negative but the variance is always positive.   \n\n     \n      ?   \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n   ?   \n\n \n\n   \n\n|\n    \n    \n\n|  ?   \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n    \n\n \n\nIf   &lt;0, the correlation between price and conditional volatility are negative (leverage \n\neffect) and vice-versa. \n\n3.5.4 Assymetric Power GARCH\n4\n \n\nIn this model, the power parameter   can be estimated rather than imposed and   \n\nparameter is added to capture the asymmetry.  \n\n  \n     ?   \n\n \n\n   \n\n              \n  ?   \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n  \n\nA positive (negative) value of the   parameter means that past negative (positive) \n\nshocks have a deeper impact on current conditional volatility than past positive \n\n(negative) shocks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n4\n All the other models are particular cases of APARCH, depending from the estimate for  .

Backtesting Methods \n\n \n\nAs seen from the previous section, there are many methods to model and forecast \n\nconditional volatility. Each method computes different VaR estimations, so it is crucial \n\nto estimate the accuracy of each one separately. In order to evaluate the quality of the \n\nestimates, the models should be backtested in the appropriate way. \n\nBacktesting is the statistical procedure where actual returns are compared to \n\ncorresponding VaR estimates of a given period. For instance, in a 100-daily sample, \n\nusing a 95% confidence level, it is expected to have five exceptions           this \n\nkind of test is named as tests of unconditional coverage. \n\nBesides it is important, this property is not the only one required, these exceptions \n\nshould be spread out over time, i.e., independent of each other. This clustering effect on \n\nexceptions indicates that the model does not accurately capture the changes in volatility \n\nand correlations of the market. Thus, we have to do conditional coverage tests on the \n\ndata. \n\nIn case of the failure of these tests, the assumptions considered can be wrong, which \n\nlead the model not to be accurate in predicting the unforeseen events as well as it may \n\nbe necessary review the entire methodology.  \n\nAfterwards, it will be presented the statistical test used by the backtesting Kupiec \n\nproportion of failures-test (1995) and Christoffersen interval forecast test (1998). \n\n4.1 Kupiec Test \n\nThe Kupiec test method is based on the failure rate, i.e., it quantifies the number of \n\ntimes that the VaR estimate is exceed by the observed returns and simultaneously it \n\ncompares the corresponding percentage with the level of significance    . Denoting the \n\nnumber of exceptions as N and the total number of observations as T, the failure rate is \n\ncomputed by dividing N by T. In an ideal situation, this rate should converge towards \n\nthe significance level     with an increased sample size.  \n\nHowever, this method does not consider the returns distribution or by how much the \n\nVaR is exceeded but just how often this occurs.  Each observation produces a VaR \n\nviolation exception or not defined as Binary function: \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n16 \n\n \n\nT = 255 days T= 510 Days T=1000 days\n\n1% 99% N &lt;7 1 &lt;N &lt;11 4 &lt;N &lt;17\n\n2,5% 97,5% 2 &lt;N &lt;12 6 &lt;N &lt;21 26 &lt;N &lt;36\n\n5% 95% 6 &lt;N &lt;21 16 &lt;N &lt;36 37 &lt;N &lt;65\n\n7,5% 92,5% 11 &lt;N &lt;28 27 &lt;N &lt;51 56 &lt;N &lt;92\n\n10% 90% 16 &lt;N &lt;36 38 &lt;N &lt;65 81 &lt;N &lt;120\n\nProbability \n\nLe ve l p\n\nVaR \n\nConfide nce  \n\nLe ve l\n\nNonre je ction Re gion for Numbe r of \n\nFailure s N\n\n   {\n               \n\n               \n5 \n\nThe null hypothesis for this test is: \n\n    [  ]      \n\nwhere p is the failure rate. \n\nThe aim of this test is to find out whether the observed failure rate, p, is significantly \n\ndifferent from ?. \n\nFurthermore, Kupiec test is a likelihood-ratio (LR) test; therefore, this test is \n\nasymptotically chi-squared distributed with one degree of freedom, and is expressed in \n\nthe following way:  \n\n          [     \n     ]      [          ]     \n\n \n \n\nIf the values of the above test exceed the critical value of the     \n \n\n distribution (3,841 for \n\n95% confidence level and 6,635 for 99% confidence level), the null hypothesis is \n\nrejected and the model becomes inaccurate to forecast extreme returns (those exceeding \n\nthe VaR). \n\nKupiec define as non-rejection regions for a 95%\n6\n confidence level, with different \n\nprobability levels, p and number of observations, as we can see in Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Nonrejection regions for Kupiec test under different confidence levels and sample sizes \n\nThis table shows the non-rejection regions for the Kupiec Test at 95% confidence level. As expected the \n\nnumber of failures decreases at higher confidence levels. In addition the range of acceptance is lowest \n\nwhen the sample size increases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n5\n VaR is by definition a negative value \n\n6\n Note that the confidence level of the backtest is not related with the confidence level used in the VaR \n\ncalculation.  \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n17 \n\n \n\nIf the percentage of exceptions are systematically higher than  , we come out with the \n\nconclusion that the model underestimates the VaR; unlike, if it is systematically inferior \n\nto  , the model is overestimating the VaR. \n\nHowever, there are some critical pointed out against this test. The main critique is that \n\nthis test only considers the frequency of losses and ignores the number of the times they \n\noccur. Those critics go further and highlight the consequences: the test will not be \n\naccurate as it does not capture the volatility clustering. Thus, according to Campbell \n\n(2005), the backtesting should not rely only on tests of unconditional coverage. \n\n4.2. Christoffersen Test \n\nThe previous described test does not test whether VaR model is capable of reacting to \n\nchanges both in volatility and correlation in a way that exceptions occur independently \n\nof each other. \n\nAs a consequence, Christoffersen (1998) presented the conditional coverage test, which \n\npurpose is to deal with the problem mentioned above. This test has two properties: \n\nunconditional coverage and independence. The procedure is the same as in the Kupiec\u2019s \n\ntest; moreover, it extends the test to include also a separate statistic for independence of \n\nexceptions. According to these changes, the VaR model is accurate if the probability of \n\noccurring a loss in a certain day is independent from the probability of occurring a loss \n\nin the previous day.    \n\nFirst and similar to what was done in the previous test, it is necessary to define the \n\nvariable    is 1 if the VaR is exceeded; and 0 if VaR is not exceeded: \n\n   {\n                    \n\n            \n \n\nThen, it is defined nij as the number of days when It= j (j\n7\n=0,1) occurred, assuming that \n\nIt-1=i (i\n6\n=0,1) condition verifies on the previous day. Thus, n00 presents the number of \n\nconsecutive no exceptions; n01 presents a non-exception followed by an exception and \n\nso on. We can see these outcomes in the following table: \n\n \n\n                                                           \n7\n (0 = no exception, 1 = exception) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n18 \n\n \n\n It-1 = 0 It-1 = 1  \n\nIt = 0 n00 n10 n00 + n10 \n\nIt = 1 n01 n11 n01 + n11 \n\n n00 + n01 n10 + n11 N \n\n \n\nIn addition, let p represent the probability of observing an exception if an exception \n\noccurred, or not the day before: \n\n   \n   \n\n       \n                                   \n\n   \n\n       \n                       and         \n\n       \n\n               \n \n\nThe    represents a proportion of failures in which the last return was not exceeded and \n\n   represents a proportion of failures in which the last return was exceeded.  \n\nThe null hypothesis of this test is that the probability p1 equals p0, i.e., today\u2019s \n\nexceptions should not depend on the exception occurred in the previous day. \n\nThe statistic of this test is the following likelihood-ratio:  \n\n           [(    \n                   ]   \n\n    [ (     \n                 \n\n     \n   ]     \n\n \n \n\nThe combination of the two statistical tests has both characteristics of a good VaR \n\nmodel: correct failure rate must be equal to ? and independence of exceptions. \n\n    \n8             \n\nEach of component is chi-square distributed, with one degree of freedom; thus LRcc also \n\nfollows a chi-square distribution but with two degrees of freedom (    \n \n\n). \n\nIn this case, if the test\u2019s value is lower than the critical value (5,991 for a 95% \n\nconfidence level and 9,2103 for a 99% confidence level ), then we do not reject the null \n\nhypothesis. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n8\n Assuming that they are independent. \n\n(14) \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n19 \n\n \n\nThe evaluation of this test should be done in combination and individually because if \n\nnull hypothesis was rejected we know the reason for this (inaccurate coverage, clustered \n\nexceptions or both). Campbell (2005) said that in some cases it is possible that the \n\nmodel fail in the separate test but pass in the combined test.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n20 \n\n \n\n5. Data and Methodology  \n\nIn this chapter will be presented the data and methodology used to compute the VaR \n\nthrough the methods previously described, with the aim of examining the accuracy of \n\nthe models to estimate the VaR.  \n\n5.1. Data  \n\nThe data set comprises daily returns of several representative economic series of stock \n\nindexes, exchange rates and two particular commodities during the period from January \n\n1, 2000 to December 31, 2011. Note that the sample encompasses the most recent crisis \n\nin the financial market, the subprime crisis that began in the summer of 2007 and which \n\nconsequences are still reflected nowadays. During this period many financial \n\ninstitutions suffered large losses all around the world making it reasonable to consider \n\nan estimation of the accuracy of the VaR when predicting these losses.  So, we will \n\nconsider two sub periods: before crisis period (from 01-01-2000 to 31-07-2007) and \n\nduring crisis period\n9\n (from 1-08-2007 to 31-12-2011) in the analysis. The data embodies \n\nthe following financial assets: \n\n? Eurostoxx 50 \u2013 Representative European market index \n\n? S&amp;P 500 - Representative American market index \n\n? Nikkei 225 - Representative Japanese market index \n\n? FTSE 100 - Representative British market index \n\n? EUR/USD \u2013 Exchange rate euro - American dollar \n\n? EUR/JPY - Exchange rate euro - Japanese yen \n\n? EUR/CHF - Exchange rate euro - Swiss franc \n\n? EUR/GBP - Exchange rate euro - British pound \n\n? Gold \n\n? Brent  \n\n                                                           \n9\n The onset of the financial crisis is generally accepted to be late July 2007. On August 2007, the \n\nEuropean Central Bank provided the first large emergency loan to banks in response to increasing \n\npressures in the euro interbank market. \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n21 \n\n \n\nConsequently, we expect to find interesting tail behaviors all over the world, as seen in \n\nthe following table and charts. The data were obtained through Bloomberg. \n\nTable 2: Data Analysis \n\nThis table summarizes the main descriptive statistics and also shows the Jarque-bera statistic used for to \n\ntest normality. The null hypothesis of normality is rejected at any confidence level (exception for \n\nEuroStoxx indexes in Panel B). For the most of the assets concerned the kurtosis is higher than three and \n\nthe skewness is negative which is characteristic of financial data. \n\nPanel A: Full Period \n\n \n\nEuroStoxx S&amp;P Nikkei FTSE EUR/USD EUR/GBP EUR/JPY EUR/CHF Gold Brent \n\nAverage -0,024% -0,005% -0,027% -0,007% 0,011% 0,010% 0,001% -0,009% 0,055% 0,045% \n\nStd.

The graphs show the existence of periods of higher and lower volatility, demonstrating that the volatility is not constant and varies over time. The oil \n\nasset is the asset with higher volatility, according to the standard deviation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n23 \n\n \n\nAs we can observe in the tables above, considering full period, gold was the asset that \n\npresented higher daily average returns (0,055%) whereas the index Nikkei presented the \n\nlowest return in average (-0,03%), being also the second index with higher volatility \n\nmeasure according to the standard deviation estimates (1,602%). When comparing all \n\nthe assets, Brent has the higher standard deviation (2,55%) as perceived through the \n\nchart above. The minimum and maximum returns were also observed in this \n\ncommodity.  \n\nRegarding the differences between the period before and during the crisis, in all assets \n\nexcept gold, were found a decrease in average returns. Considering volatility, the period \n\nduring crisis presents a higher standard deviation for all indices comparing with the \n\nperiod before the crisis, revealing that we are in the presence of a period of great \n\nuncertainty for the markets. \n\nAnalyzing the measures of skewness and kurtosis, seven in ten assets have negative \n\nskewness, meaning that the distribution is asymmetric on the left side, having heavier \n\ntails. When considering the kurtosis, we observe that this measure exceeds three in all \n\nassets except the exchange rates EUR/USD and EUR/GBP meaning that distribution is \n\nleptokurtic which is to say that the distributions tends to have a heavy tails compared to \n\nthe normal distribution. It is important to emphasize the value of kurtosis EUR/CHF \n\nexchange rate (56.116) meaning that distribution is peaked. Analyzing the two sub \n\nperiods this increase was justified by the crisis period where the value has increased \n\ncompared to the period before the crisis. Considering the two sub periods we conclude \n\nthat this increase was justified by the crisis where the value has increased significantly \n\ncompared to the previous period. \n\nTo confirm this conclusion, the Jarque-Bera statistic used to test the normality, was also \n\ncomputed. The null hypothesis of normality is rejected at any significance level \n\nreinforcing the idea of the non-normality. The only exception is the EuroStoxx index in \n\nthe before crisis period where the null hypothesis is not rejected, which means that \n\nbased on the sample there is no statistical evidence to reject the null of normality. \n\nFurthermore, this conclusion can be confirmed through the values of kurtosis near 3 and \n\nskewness near 0. \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n24 \n\n \n\nThis characteristics are common among financial assets distributions i.e., kurtosis \n\nhigher than three and negative skewness indicating that the assets returns does not \n\nfollow a normal distribution as is assumed in some methods of VaR calculation.  \n\n5.2. Methodology  \n\nBased in the last known price of the data, the log returns used to estimate the VaR were \n\nalso computed: \n\n          (\n  \n\n    \n) \n\nWith regard to all the approaches discussed earlier, an estimation of the \n\nconditional variance was made (except for the equally weighted moving average in \n\nwhich no volatility update must be made) and posteriorly was computed the volatility \n\nadjusted returns through the following formula\n10\n\n:  \n\n   \n        \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n \n\nWhere: \n\n     : Historical return of variable j on day t of the period covered by the historical \n\nsample \n\n   \n   : Historical GARCH/EWMA estimate of the daily variance of the percentage \n\nchange in variable j made for day t at the end of day t-1 \n\n   \n   :  Most recent GARCH/EWMA estimate of the daily variance \n\nAn adjustment of the historical changes to the current volatility was used for computing \n\nthe VaR instead of the actual historical percentage changes in market variables. \n\nThe backtesting procedure was computed by comparing daily profits and losses with \n\ndaily VaR estimates using a time period of one year, i.e. 250 trading days. \n\n                                                           \n10\n\n Hull, J. and A.

For each market variable and \n\napproach a calculation of the          was performed, with levels of 1% and 5% of \n\nsignificance, and two indicator functions were defined,    and    for day t.    (      if \n\nthe observed percentage variation would be less than the 5(1) percentile on day t, \n\notherwise the value would be zero, as discussed before in the backtesting technique. \n\nFor exponential weighted moving average method, we will set a decay factor at 0.94 \n\naccording to J.P.Morgan (1996). \n\nAll the parameters used in GARCH models were computed through E-views software. \n\nOn the GARCH models estimation is assumed that errors follow a Student's t \n\ndistribution. This distribution is usually considered instead to the normal distribution \n\ndue heavier tails characteristics of the financial assets. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n26 \n\n \n\n6. Empirical Results \n\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to find the best approach to model the \n\nvolatility to be use in VaR estimation and verifying if changes were observed during the \n\nbefore crisis period and crisis period. \n\n6.1. Full Period \n\nAfter the estimation of VaR considering six different approaches for two confidence \n\nlevels, the values of the two statistical tests presented in the section 4 were computed in \n\norder to achieve the main conclusions. The values can be analyzed in table 3. \n\nNote that in some models it is not possible to compute the independence test, because \n\nthe VaR was not exceeded on two consecutive days, i.e., the n11 is equal to zero.  \n\nWhen analyzing the results computed from the tests of Kupiec and Christoffersen \n\n(LRcc), considering a confidence level of 99%, the HS and E-GARCH models are the \n\nonly rejected, since their test value is lower than the critical value (9,21). Comparing the \n\nmodels not rejected, we can conclude that the GARCH and EWMA model performed \n\nbetter since it was not statically rejected by any asset, relying on a confidence level of \n\n99%. On average, APARCH model present a better result however is rejected for \n\nforecast oil commodity which is the asset with higher volatility. The GJR-GARCH is \n\nalso rejected for the same asset and EUR/GBP exchange rate.  \n\nFor 5% tails, the same models were not rejected, but on average, GJR-GARCH and \n\nAPARCH models had a better performance when compared with the GARCH, since the \n\naverage of the joint test is lower. Regarding the exchange rate forecasts EUR/GBP, \n\nconsidered a confidence level of 95%, these were rejected in all the proposed models. \n\nThe GJR-GARCH model is only rejected only for the asset mentioned earlier, the \n\nAPARCH is rejected to this asset and the EUR/USD exchange rate while the GARCH is \n\nrejected also for EUR/JPY. On the EWMA model we reject three of the four exchange \n\nrates (EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY and EUR/GBP). \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n27 \n \n\n?=1%\n\nLR_uc LR_ind LR_cc LR_uc LR_ind LR_cc LR_uc LR_ind LR_cc LR_uc LR_ind LR_cc LR_uc LR_ind LR_cc LR_uc LR_ind LR_cc\n\nEuroStoxx 11,6011              1,2246     12,8257         1,1307         0,5894    1,7201      2,0040       0,4604       2,4644     2,5259      -

When taking into account a 95% confidence level, the results are even worse once \n\nthe test for the EGARCH model was rejected in all assets as we can see in the following \n\ntable. \n\nTable 4: Number of non-rejected assets \n\nThis table presents the number of non-rejected assets in the unconditional coverage test (Kupiec Test), the \n\nindependence (Christoffersen test) and the joint test (Combined test) considering all the proposed models. \n\nConsidering the combined test, EWMA and GARCH models were not rejected for all of the assets at 99% \n\nconfidence level. Regarding a confidence level of 95%, the model with less assets not rejected is the GJR-\n\nGARCH while the E-GARCH is rejected in all assets.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, at 99% confidence level, the GARCH and EWMA models performed \n\nbetter since they are not rejected in any of the considered assets. For 5% tails, GJR-\n\nGARCH model had a better performance of capturing VaR forecast.  \n\nAs mentioned before, the test analysis must be done individually in order to determine \n\nthe cause of rejection towards the test. Further information on this analysis can be found \n\nin table 3 and table 4 presented before. \n\nThe cause of the rejection of oil commodity and EUR/GBP exchange rate, considering a \n\nconfidence level of 99%, is due to the inaccurate coverage, meaning that the VaR \n\nestimation is exceeded more times than the significance level.  \n\nThe rejection of the A-PARCH and GRJ-GARCH models to predict the VaR on the \n\nexchange rate EUR/GBP (to a level of significance of 95%) is due to clustering \n\nexception since the test of independence is rejected in both models. For the rejections of \n\nGARCH and EWMA model the reason is the same. \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n29 \n\n \n\nLooking for the tests individually, in average terms we keep the previous conclusions. It \n\nis important to notice that for the exchange rate EUR/USD the GJR-GARCH and \n\nGARCH models were rejected in Kupiec test but were acceptable on combined \n\nregarding a significance level of 5%. Still, on average the APARCH model has a better \n\nperformance on a significance level of 95%. Considering the significance level of 99% \n\nthe EWMA performed better.  \n\nRegarding the independence test, on average none of the models is rejected for 99% \n\nlevel confidence level. However, when considering 95% level of confidence, the HS \n\nand E-GARCH are rejected. On average, GARCH model performs better in capturing \n\nvolatility clustering considering 1% level of significance but when using a 5% level of \n\nsignificance, GJR-GARCH presents a lower average value meaning a better \n\nperformance against the others. In this test it is importance to notice the rejection of \n\nEWMA model, this model was rejected in five of ten assets (Table 4) meaning that at \n\n5% significance level this model do not capture the changes in the volatility. \n\nStill, it is necessary to reinforce that for some models that last two exceptions do not \n\napply, since the Christoffersen test is inept. From this, we can conclude that the time \n\nindependence exception is captured by the model, which may not correspond to reality. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n30 \n\n \n\nHS EWMA GARCH APARCH E-GARCH GJR-GARCH\n\n?=1% 8 10 10 10 8 10\n\n?=5% 6 9 10 8 7 10\n\n?=1% 5 10 10 7 5 10\n\n?=5% 3 8 9 7 4 10\n\nCombine d te st\n\nBefore Crisis Period\n\nCrisis Period\n\n6.2. Sub Periods \n\nThis section will analyze the main differences between the two sub periods considered \n\n(before crisis period and crisis period) in order to check if there are significant \n\ndifferences in the performance of the models due to increased volatility. In this period \n\nwhich begins in August 2007, market was characterized by a higher level of volatility, \n\nequity markets all over the world performed poorly. The conclusions will be presented \n\nbased in the joint tests (Table 6).   \n\nFirstly at 99% confidence level, considering the before crisis period, on average all \n\napproaches were not rejected. The method that performed better had been the GJR-\n\nGARCH model followed by APARCH since these models presents the lowest test \n\nvalue. In these models, along with EWMA and GARCH model, all assets were not \n\nrejected. The approach with the worst performance was HS which indicate an \n\nunderestimation of VaR in this method. The assets rejected in the E-GARCH and HS \n\nare the same (EUR/GBP and oil). \n\nRegarding of the period during the crisis, all the approaches were not rejected but the \n\naverage test value of the HS method is very close to the critical value (9,21) what would \n\nbe expected given that in this period there was an increase in volatility and in this \n\nmethod none volatility update is done. The methods that perform better were GARCH, \n\nGJR-GARCH and EWMA model. These models are not rejected for all assets while \n\nAPARCH model was rejected for three assets (S&amp;P, EUR/CHF and oil) as we can see \n\nin the following table. EurStoxx, S&amp;P, FTSE indexes and oil commodity are the \n\nrejected assets by all the remaining models (E-GARCH and HS). \n\nTable 5: Number of non-rejected assets \n\nThis table indicates the number of not rejected assets in the joint test (Combined test) considering all the \n\nproposed models and the two sub periods. The \u201cscenario\u201d is better in before crisis period where most of \n\nthe assets were not rejected. The GJR-GARCH is the best model since none of the assets is rejected in all \n\nthe scenarios considered.  \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n31 \n\n \n\n?=1% HS EWMA GARCH APARCH E-GARCH GJR-GARCH ?=5%

and the two sub periods \n\nThis table summarizes the join test results for both of confidence levels considered. In bold we have the values where critical values were not exceeded.  This section is only \n\npresented the combined test since the main objective is to check what are the main differences between the models in two sub periods. On average, considering the before \n\ncrisis period, the GJR-GARCH model presents better performance having an account a confidence level of 99%, although with a confidence level of 95% the GARCH shows \n\na better performance. The situation is reverse in crisis period. The worse models were the same, the only difference is that in before crisis period, the values of the test were \n\nsmaller and the models are not rejected. \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n32 \n\n \n\nFinally at 95% confidence level, regarding the before crisis period, on average all the \n\nmethods were not rejected despite, the HS and E-GARCH average test being close to \n\nthe critical value (5,99). The best approach to forecast volatility is GARCH and GJR-\n\nGARCH model. In these models, none of assets were rejected. The EWMA model was \n\nrejected the asset gold while in APARCH approach was rejected also the gold and the \n\nS&amp;P index. \n\nWhen considering the during crisis period, some changes are observed. The HS and E-\n\nGARCH model were rejected in 7 and 6 of the 10 assets respectively (Table 5). In this \n\ncase, the GJR-GARCH was the model that best performing followed by GARCH. The \n\nexchange rate EUR/USD is only not rejected using the GJR-GARCH model. This is \n\nalso the asset rejected by GARCH while the EWMA was rejected by the same exchange \n\nrate and the exchange rate EUR/JPY. Finally, A-PARCH was also rejected for S&amp;P \n\nindex and oil. \n\nComparing the two sub periods, we can conclude that the best models to predicting \n\nvolatility is GARCH and GJR-GARCH models which is consistent with the conclusion \n\nmade in the analysis of the full period. Considering before crisis period at a 99% \n\nconfidence level the model that shows the best performance is GJR-GARCH, assuming \n\na 95% confidence level the best model is GARCH, the situation is reversed in the crisis \n\nperiod.  \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n33 \n \n\n7. Conclusions \n\nThe VaR has been considered the most popular market risk measure among financial \n\ninstitutions. All VaR estimation methods use historical data to forecast the future \n\nperformance of financial assets. Furthermore, the methods under VaR estimation require \n\nassumptions that in general are not supported by data, and this is the main reason why \n\nthis risk measure has been the subject of some criticism. \n\nThe most commonly used method to estimate VaR is historical simulation; this \n\napproach is the most used by financial institutions due to fewer assumptions needed. \n\nThe main difference between VaR estimation methodologies is how the assets volatility \n\nis computed. \n\nIn the theoretical section we discussed some models to predict volatility in order to \n\nestimate the VaR from which different results were obtained. Six methodologies were \n\ntested and compared by using backtesting techniques. \n\nRegarding the methodologies considered the models that present a better performance to \n\nforecast VaR were the GARCH assuming a confidence level of 99%, while considering \n\na significance level of 95% the GJR-GARCH shows better performance. \n\nThe models with the worse performance are the Historical Simulation (HS), what would \n\nbe expected given the disadvantages referred in the literature, and the E-GARCH as can \n\nbe seen based on the results of the tests. \n\nAmong the assets under consideration, the exchange rates EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY and \n\nEUR/EUR/USD were the assets in which the models reveal more failures especially \n\nwith a confidence level of 95%. \n\nContrary to the common empirical financial result, the asymmetric conditional volatility \n\nmodels did not show superiority in terms of VaR forecasting accuracy when compared \n\nto the symmetric GARCH model. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n34 \n \n\nRegarding the differences between the two sub periods analyzed, it can be said that the \n\nconclusions are similar for both of them: the models with the best performance in the \n\ncrisis period and the before crisis period are the same ones as in the full period. The \n\nonly exception to the conclusions is that the worse performance models considered in \n\nboth crisis period and full period are not rejected in the before crisis period. \n\nFor further developments it would be interesting to analyze other significance levels \n\nless than 1% and estimate the VaR by extreme value theory. This is the latest method \n\napplied to financial theory. In addition, the VaR prediction could have been tested \n\nthrough the use of other backtesting techniques as Basel traffic light approach or mixed \n\nKupiec-test by Hass (2001). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModeling Volatility \n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAlexander, C.
