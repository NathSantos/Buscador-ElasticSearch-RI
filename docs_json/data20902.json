Correlations among seven hydrochemical parameters are statistically examined. A four-component\n\nmodel is suggested and explains 81% of total variance. Component 1 represents calcium-magnesium bicarbonated\n\ngroundwaters with long time of residence. Component 2 represents sulfated and chlorinated calcium and sodium\n\ngroundwaters; Component 3 represents sodium bicarbonated groundwaters; and Component 4 is characterized by\n\nsodium sulfated with high fluoride facies. The components\u2019 spatial distribution shows high fluoride concentration\n\nalong analyzed tectonic fault system and aligned on northeast direction in other areas, suggesting other hydrogeological\n\nfault systems. High fluoride concentration increases according to groundwater pumping depth. The Principal Com-\n\nponent Analysis reveals features of the groundwater mixture and individualizes water facies.

High fluoride contents in groundwater are\nresponsible for human and animal health problems caus-\ning dental and skeletal fluorosis, which is detected world-\nwide, like in China (Lin et al. 2004, Genxu and Guodong\n2001), India (Kumar et al. 2001), Kenya (Moturi et al.\n2002), and Israel (Kafri et al. 1989), among other coun-\ntries. In the Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil,\nthe endemic fluorosis has been detected in several dis-\ntricts (e.g. Venancio Aires, Santa Cruz do Sul, Pantano\nGrande, General Camara).

The drinking water\nlimit recommended by the World Health Organization\nfor fluoride is 1.5 mg/L (WHO 2002), and in a moderate\nconcentration (0.7-1.2 mg/L) prevents dental cavities.\n\nThe main aim of the current study is to understand\nthe distribution of high-fluoride waters in the Serra Geral\nAquifer System (SGAS) and to identify the hydrochemi-\ncal types and their spatial distribution, using the Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA). PCA is an important tool\nfor understanding the large quantity of data involved in\nextended aquifer studies (Invernizzi and Oliveira 2004).\nThis aids to define geological sources and pathways for\nhigh fluoride, consequently, assisting future well loca-\ntions and management of SGAS waters. Investigations\nabout the source of high fluoride concentrations in\nprevious studies had shown a relationship with tectonic\nstructures and with pumping of deep groundwater.\n\nGEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY OF THE STUDY AREA\n\nThe study area is located in the Rio Grande do Sul State,\nsouthern Brazil and extends from 27?S to 31?S and\nfrom 50?W to 57?W, corresponding approximately to\n164.207 km2 in the Parana Basin. The region is covered\nby a basaltic to rhyolitic Mesozoic volcanic sequence\nbelonging to the Serra Geral Formation (SGF), whose\nthickness varies from 50 to 1000 meters (average of 550\nmeters), constituting a fractured aquifer that provides\npublic water supply to more than 80% of the cities in\nthe area.\n\nSGAS hydrochemical characteristics indicate the\ninfluence of water mixing with other sedimentary aquifer\nbelonging to the Parana Basin (Szikszay et al. 1981,\nFraga 1992, Portela Filho et al. 2002, 2004). This\naquifer is directly superimposed by the Guarany Aquifer\nSystem/GAS (Campos 2000) that has been the focus of\nseveral studies in the last few years, due to its spatial\nextent and storage potentiality as a transnational aquifer.\n\nTectonic structures cut the SGF controlling terrain\nsurface and hydrochemical characteristics of the related\naquifer. These structures are connected to the South\nAtlantic Ocean opening, causing NE and NW dominant\ndirections (Fig. 1). The main fault systems define sectors\n\nthat may be considered as hydrogeological blocks (Lis-\nboa 1996, Lisboa and Menegotto 1997, Machado 2005).\nThe tectonic block limited by the Terra de Areia-Posadas\nFault System and Mata-Jaguari Fault System is uplifted\nin the south-central area. The adjacent block to the north\nshows a gradual terrain lowering from east to west, con-\nditioned by NE normal faults, parallel to the Leao and\nPerimpo fault systems.\n\nThe identification of different water facies for SGAS\nfocused on tectonic block separations is important to\ndefine structures where high fluoride groundwater can\nascend from deep levels to SGAS. This tectonic control\nfor the high fluoride groundwaters has been reported in\nother regions (Licht 2001). In the study area the SGAS\nfluoride average concentrations are around 0.24 mg/L,\nwith a minimum value of 0.02 mg/L, and the highest\nat 3.03 mg/L. Machado (2005) describes the influence of\nCa2+HCO?3 meteoric recharge on the SGAS and mixture\nmechanisms between the SGAS and the GAS inputing\nNa+HCO?3 with SO\n\n2?\n4 and Cl\n\n? water to SGAS.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nHYDROCHEMICAL DATA\n\nHydrogeological data represent a network of 309 deep\nwells (Fig. 1) that exposes only SGAS groundwater used\nin public and private water supply. All data informa-\ntion was provided by governmental groundwater man-\nagement agencies.\n\nThis study regarded only seven major parameters\nto evaluate hydrochemical facies in the piper diagram,\nnamely fluoride, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO?3 , SO\n\n2?\n4\n\nand Cl?.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe PCA was performed using SPSS version 8 soft-\nware (Nie et al. 1975) and tested for two, three and four\nprincipal components using the eigenvalue equal to 1 cri-\nterion (Kaiser 1958). Before this procedure, outlier sup-\npression was carried out through boxplots and dispersion\ncharts for all variables. The Varimax orthogonal rotation\nwas used (Kaiser 1958), in order to facilitate Factor Anal-\nysis interpretation (Invernizzi and Oliveira 2004). Princi-\npal component scores performed in the Cluster Analysis\n(K-Means Method) allow to group wells into homoge-\nneous clusters.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2008) 80 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2008/12/3 \u2014 10:27 \u2014 page 695 \u2014 #3\n\nFLUORIDE IN FRACTURED AQUIFER BY GEOSTATISTIC TOOLS 695\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location map of SGAS(gray) in Rio Grande do Sul State, sampling wells and main tectonic fault systems: (1) Mata-Jaguari, (2) Terra de\n\nAreia-Posadas, (3) Perimpo, and (4) Leao.\n\nSPATIAL ANALYSIS\n\nSpatial distribution and interpretation of principal com-\nponents defined by PCA was performed on Geograph-\nical Information System (GIS) with Quantum GIS ver-\nsion 0.7.4 software (Sherman et al. 2005). Cluster results\nwere classified, considering the most important chemical\nparameter as an identification name.\n\nThe relationship between depth and fluoride con-\ncentration considers the maximum absolute groundwater\npumping depth in each well. This procedure was carried\nout with Labplot version 1.5 software (Gerlach 2004)\nin order to investigate whether fluoride concentration in\nSGAS increases with depth.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nPRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS\n\nTable I presents the correlation coefficient matrix for\nhydrochemical data in SGAS.\n\nThe solution using the eigenvalue criterion results in\nfour components that explain 81% of the total variance.\nComponent 4 is highly weighted by fluoride (Table II).\n\nComponent 1 is mainly influenced by HCO?3 ,\nCa2+, and Mg2+, and explains 37.43% of the total vari-\nance, representing calcium-magnesium bicarbonate\ngroundwaters with long residence time, evidenced by\nMg2+. Component 2 is defined by SO2?4 and Cl\n\n?, and\nrepresents sulfated and chlorinated, calcium and sodium\ngroundwaters.\n\nComponent 3 is explained by HCO?3 and Na\n+,\n\ndefining sodium bicarbonated groundwaters.\nComponent 4 is defined by F, followed by Na+\n\nand SO2?4 , corresponds to sodium sulfate with high flu-\noride facies.\n\nFluoride participates with similar intensity on\nComponents 2 and 3, suggesting two groundwater\nsources that contain relatively high fluoride concentra-\ntion. Therefore, fluoride was associated with sulfated\nand sodium bicarbonated groundwaters.\n\nBased on the above, cluster analysis was performed\nand selected a solution with nine clusters, since it showed\nthe best water facies individualization. Using this crite-\nrion the results pointed out a minimum number of wells\nwith meteoric water facies (212).\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2008) 80 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2008/12/3 \u2014 10:27 \u2014 page 696 \u2014 #4\n\n696 ARTHUR NANNI et al.\n\nTABLE I\nCorrelation coefficient.\n\nParameter Na+ Mg2+ Ca2+ Cl?

Thus, each cluster was renamed using related ion\npredominance (Table III). In order to facilitate the read-\ning it was decided to designate Component 1 as CaMg,\nComponent 2 as SO4, Component 3 as Na, and Compo-\nnent 4 as F.\n\nIt can be defined that clusters 3 and 4 are com-\nposed predominantly by F component groundwaters.\nClusters 1 and 7 comprise the CaMg water facies. Clus-\nter 8 is composed by Na component. The remaining\ngroups show more than one component in high concen-\ntration.\n\nIn the water facies, components SO4, Na, and F\nwere added to the main water facies. Therefore, these\nclusters were called SO4Na, SO4F, and NaF, due to\ntheir final centroid intensities. This components com-\nbination is a result of the interference of different geo-\nchemical water sources and/or mixture features.\n\nHYDROCHEMISTRY\n\nThe geochemical data were plotted in a piper diagram\n(Fig. 2), with the four renamed cluster defined by\nthe PCA. The majority of wells (212 out of 309 wells)\nhave a composition related to meteoric waters with\nCa2+HCO?3 nature and do not include high fluoride\nwaters. In this case, 212 samples are not represented\nin the diagrams, in order to obtain a better fit by the\nother groups.\n\nThe CaMg facies represents a predominant HCO?3\nwater type where Mg+2 appears in more than 50% of\nthe wells (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Na group shows their typical distribution in\nthe piper diagram, representing Na+HCO?3 waters.\n\nF distribution in the piper diagram maintains an as-\nsociation with sulfated and bicarbonated groundwaters.\nThese hydrochemical characteristics are also related to\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2008) 80 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2008/12/3 \u2014 10:27 \u2014 page 697 \u2014 #5\n\nFLUORIDE IN FRACTURED AQUIFER BY GEOSTATISTIC TOOLS 697\n\nTABLE III\nComponents final cluster centers and clusters name reclassification.\n\nComponent\nCluster\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nCaMg 1.6143 \u20130.6137 \u20130.228 0.511 \u20130.152 \u20130.724 2.042 \u20130.722 \u20131.720\n\nSO4 0.987 4.411 \u20130.377 \u20131.198 \u20130.113 9.303 \u20130.236 \u20130.260 \u20130.348\n\nNa \u20130.892 3.032 \u20130.881 \u20130.667 \u20130.305 \u20130.845 1.092 1.653 2.691\n\nF \u20130.330 \u20131.357 1.244 6.986 \u20130.250 2.849 0.285 \u20130.034 4.786\n\nCases 22 2 19 3 212 2 11 36 2\n\nWater Facies CaMg SO4Na F F Meteoric SO4F CaMg Na NaF\n\ndifferent groundwater sources or point out to mixture\nfeatures during groundwater ascending recharge.\n\nSO4Na, SO4F, and NaF facies appear only in\ntwo wells each. Both wells compose distinct groups as\nshowed in Figure 2.\n\nThe spatial distribution of water facies confirms that\nfluoride has a relationship with the analyzed fault sys-\ntems Mata-Jaguari, Terra de Areia-Posadas, Perimpo,\nand Leao (Fig. 3).\n\nMeteoric Waters occurs in all SGAS, but more\nsignificantly in the tectonic block limited by Terra de\nAreia-Posadas, Jaguari-Mata and Perimpo Fault Sys-\ntems, due to the uplift condition of this block.\n\nThe CaMg facies is spatially related to discharge\nzones of SGAS in the west, northwest, and southeast\nregions, representing waters at the final percolation stage\nunder long time residence.\n\nThe Na facies is dominant in the northwest region,\nwhere SGF achieves the maximum thickness in the study\narea, suggesting a hydrogeological tectonic block. This\ncharacteristic indicates that ascendant waters in this re-\ngion present only Na+ enrichment, as a result of water-\nrock interaction in SGF. Thus, the non-interference of\nGAS in this scenery is evident, probably due to the\nmaximum thickness of SGF.\n\nSO4Na facies appears only in the northeast align-\nment direction of the Uruguay River, showing a close\nrelationship to this regional alignment. SO4F facies\npresents a similar behavior, but occurs only in the east-\nwest section of the Uruguay River.\n\nNaF facies is spatially linked to the Na hydrogeo-\nlogical block which has a poor fluoride content. The NaF\nwith high fluoride appears only in two wells at a similar\ndistance from the Uruguay River, suggesting a particular\n\nhydrogeological condition.\nThe F group related that high fluoride groundwaters\n\nare distributed in the central-northeast portion of SGAS.\nAligned wells associated with the main tectonic fault\nsystems (Terra de Areia-Posadas, Leao and Perimpo)\nsuggest a water ascension recharge. New tectonic fault\nsystems are introduced in the present study, correspond-\ning to the linear distribution of wells belonging to F\nfacies in the central portion of SGAS, which receive\nthe nomination Fontoura Xavier-Parai and Victor\nGraeff-Barracao hydrogeological alignments (Fig. 3).\nIt must be stressed that the introduced structures are\nparallel to Leao and Perimpo Fault Systems.\n\nThe distribution of NaF facies is similar to the Na\nfacies (Fig. 3). Both are chemically very similar and\ndistinguished by a more intensive fluoride participation\nin the NaF facies.\n\nThe SO4F and SO4Na facies are scarce and closely\nassociated with major regional structures that delineate\nthe Uruguay River (Fig. 3). The SO4F facies occurs in\nthe north sector while the SO4Na facies occurs prefer-\nentially in the west sector of the study area.\n\nThe composition of the volcanic rocks belonging\nto the SGF does not comprise fluorine rich minerals to\nprovide anomalous fluoride content in the SGAS. This\nenrichment could be better explained by the ascending\ngroundwater recharge crossing older Parana Basin sed-\nimentary sequences combined with long residence time\nand extreme confination conditions.\n\nThe A-D geological cross-section (Figs. 1 and 4)\ndemonstrates the east-west gradual terrain lowering, due\nto tectonic block accommodation, where hydrogeologi-\ncal ascension structures are represented. Near the well\n\u201cB\u201d (Fig. 1) the Na block limit is registered.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2008) 80 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2008/12/3 \u2014 10:27 \u2014 page 698 \u2014 #6\n\n698 ARTHUR NANNI et al.\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Water facies distribution in the Piper Diagram, showing two fluoride hydrochemical types (I \u2013 sulfated; II \u2013 bicarbonated).\n\nThe depth variation shows fluoride concentration\nincrease according to groundwater pumping depth\n(Fig. 5). It can be demonstrated that beyond F facies,\nall the other facies increase the fluoride content with the\ndepth. This behavior probably is related to the influ-\nence of confined GAS and the proximity of other older\naquifer systems.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe PCA methodology was efficient to discriminate\nhydrochemical water facies in a collection of more than\n300 wells located in the SGAS in Rio Grande do Sul\nState, southern Brazil, with special emphasis to the fluo-\nride content. As a result a comprehensive spatial model\n\nwas achieved, using seven chemical components that\nvalidate six hydrochemical facies were distinguished in\nthe SGAS, three of them containing substantial fluoride\ncontents in combination with Na+ and SO2?4 . The spa-\ntial distribution of these facies confirms the presence of\nhydrogeological blocks limited by tectonic alignments.\n\nTwo tectonic structures are apparently present in\nthe central area, indicated by linear distribution of high\nfluoride groundwater wells. An aquifer system status\nfor SGAS is reaffirmed, considering complex chemical\nmixtures, recharge processes and percolation through the\nfractured reservoir. The ascending recharge processes\nare considered to define ionic enrichment, especially in\nNa+, F?, SO2?4 and Cl\n\n?.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2008) 80 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2008/12/3 \u2014 10:27 \u2014 page 699 \u2014 #7\n\nFLUORIDE IN FRACTURED AQUIFER BY GEOSTATISTIC TOOLS 699\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Water facies distribution and tectonic fault systems: (1) Mata-Jaguari, (2) Terra de Areia-Posadas, (3) Perimpo, and (4) Leao.
