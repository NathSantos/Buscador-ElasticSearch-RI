Adviser: Jorge \nAbdala Dergam. Co-advisers: Karla Suemy Clemente Yotoko and Rubens \nPazza. \n\n \n\nThe Neotropical freshwater fish fauna is considered the richest of the \n\nworld. This diversity is the direct result of the complex palaeohydrological \n\nhistory of the Central and South-American rivers, a process that promoted \n\nvicariance and dispersion of the aquatic biota along millions of years. The \n\ncommon trahira H. malabaricus is a widespread, sedentary predatory \n\nNeotropical characin. Due to its abundance and tolerance to transportation \n\nand laboratory conditions, the trahira has become a relevant model organism \n\nfor experimental biology. H. malabaricus populations are characterized by 7 \n\nkaryomorphs named A-G. The allopatric and sympatric distribution of these \n\nkaryomorphs has been considered as evidence for the existence of multiple \n\nlineages that behave as good species within this nominal taxon. To test this \n\nhypothesis, biogeographic, cytogenetic and molecular (mitochondrial DNA) \n\npatterns were analyzed in 17 populations (73 specimens) from 12 basins in \n\nnortheasten and southeastern Brazil. Cytogenetic patterns indicated a XX/XY \n\nchromosome system in karyomorph 2n=40F. Molecular data indicated \n\nabsence of gene flow among karyomorphs 2n=40 and 2n=42 and provided \n\nthe first evidence of a coastal origin of the 2n=42 karyomorphs in the Jacar\u00e9 \n\nRiver. The absence of a constant molecular rate of substitution hampered a \n\ncorrelation of past dispersal events and it was interepreted as an effect of \n\nextreme demographic fluctuations in this species complex. These results \n\nindicate that karyotypic identification is relevant and necessary for placing all \n\nexperimental data in a phylogenetic context. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 1\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \nThe Neotropical region harbours 6025 species of freshwater fishes \n\n(Reis et al., 2003), but perhaps as many as 8000 (Schaefer, 1998), the result \n\nof a long evolutionary history of isolation and specialization, involving mainly \n\nOtophysan fishes. Freshwater fishes are highly suitable for the recovery of \n\npast biogeographic processes, due to their obligatory relationship with water \n\n(Myers, 1938). The biogeographical information relevant for fish \n\ndiversification has been reviewed by Lundberg et al. (1998) and Ribeiro \n\n(2006). The former revision focused on the evolution of Andean \n\ngeomorphology and the effects of this process on the South American \n\ncontinent, whereas the latter work dealt with the evolution of particular \n\ncoastal drainages, their geomorphological interactions with continental basins \n\nand the expected levels of phylogenetic divergence among fishes derived \n\nduring this complex temporal scenario. \n\n \n\nAmong Neotropical freshwater fishes, the trahira, Hoplias malabaricus \n\n(Bloch, 1794), has one of the largest distributional ranges, occurring from \n\nPanam\u00e1 to the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina (Berra, 2007). Hoplias \n\nmalabaricus is well adapted to life in small, isolated populations, in conditions \n\nthat may facilitate the stochastic fixation of chromosomal rearrangements \n\n(Sites &amp; Moritz, 1987). This species is one of the cytogenetically most studied \n\ntaxa and shows a conspicuous karyotypic diversification, with up to seven \n\nkaryomorphs with diploid numbers ranging from 39 to 42. Three groups of \n\nkaryomorphs are readily evident, based on distribution ranges. Two \n\nkaryomorphs, 2n=42A and 2n=40C, are the most widespread and occur in \n\nsympatry in the Lower Paran\u00e1-Paraguay and Amazon basins. A second, less \n\nwidely spread group is represented by three karyomorphs: \n\n\u2022 2n=40F occurs in the S\u00e3o Francisco Basin, in the lower portions of the \n\nTocantins River, in coastal drainages in Suriname, and in minor basins in \n\nnorth-eastern Brazil; \n\n\u2022 2n=39/40D occurs in the Upper Paran\u00e1 (in sympatry with 2n=42A) and; \n\n\n\n 5\n\n\u2022 2n=40/41G occurs exclusively in the Amazonian Basin in the Aripuan\u00e3, \n\nMadeira and Trombetas rivers. \n\nThe third group consists of karyomorphs with much restricted distributions. \n\nFor example, 2n=42B occurs in the Doce Basin (also in sympatry with \n\n2n=42A), and 2n=42E occurs only in the Trombetas River, as indicated by \n\nsurveys conducted so far (Bertollo et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nThe lack of hybrids between sympatric karyomorphs has been \n\ninterpreted as evidence for the existence of several distinct species within \n\nthis nominal taxon (Bertollo et al., 1986; Bertollo et al., 2000). Therefore, \n\nuniparental molecular markers can be a particularly useful complement to \n\nassess gene flow in wild populations. To date, molecular studies on H. \n\nmalabaricus have been restricted to populations in the Doce Basin (Dergam \n\net al., 2002) and the Igua\u00e7u Basin (Dergam et al., 1998). Both studies \n\nindicated phylogenetically related populations in the coastal and continental \n\nbasins, but failed to reveal the direction of dispersal events. \n\n \n\nKaryotypic and molecular patterns of variation may reveal vicariances \n\nand dispersals that provide insights into evolutionary processes that may \n\ninvolve other components of the aquatic fauna. The congruence of \n\nindependent molecular and cytogenetic characters may give support to the \n\nhypothesis that at least some karyomorphs behave as valid species within H. \n\nmalabaricus. A better understanding of H. malabaricus species-level \n\nsystematics is needed to correctly interpret the comparative physiological, \n\nbehavioural and anatomical studies in an explicit phylogenetic framework \n\n(Harvey &amp; Pagel, 1991). Biodiversity patterns in this species complex also \n\nbear potential information to understand the palaeohydrology of the \n\ncontinent. In the present study, patterns of cytogenetic and molecular \n\nvariation of H. malabaricus populations in the S\u00e3o Francisco, Grande and in \n\nseveral coastal basins along Eastern Brazil were analyzed using molecular \n\nand cytogenetic techniques. \n\n \n\n3. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n\n\n\n 6\n\n3.1 SPECIMENS AND CHROMOSOME PREPARATION \n\n \n\nCytogenetic analyses were carried out on 49 specimens collected in \n\nthe Pandeiros River, Par\u00e1 River and its headwaters in the Tombadouro \n\nCreek and in the Jacar\u00e9 River. (Table I, Fig. 1). Cell division was stimulated \n\nin vivo with two daily applications of Munolan\u00ae, a commercially available \n\nantigen lysate, following Molina (2001). Mitotic chromosomes were obtained \n\nfrom cell suspensions of the anterior kidney, using the conventional air-drying \n\nmethod (Bertollo et al., 1978). Fish were previously anesthetized with clove \n\noil according to Henyey et al. (2002). Secondary data from 10 populations \n\nwith known chromosome numbers were also included in the analysis. \n\n \n\n3.2 CHROMOSOME STAINING \n\n \n\nIn addition to the standard Giemsa method, chromosomes were \n\nanalyzed using silver nitrate staining (Howell &amp; Black, 1980) to visualize the \n\nnucleolar organizing regions (Ag-NORs). C banding was also employed to \n\ndetect C-positive heterochromatin (Sumner, 1972). DAPI and Chromomycin \n\nA3 (CMA3) fluorescence staining were used to identify the chromosome AT \n\nand GC rich regions, respectively (Sola et al., 1992).

The \n\nsecond probe is specific to H. malabaricus (Ferreira et al., 2007) and \n\ncontained a copy of the repetitive satellite 5SHindIII-DNA sequence with 360 \n\nbp composed of a 95-bp segment similar to the 5S rRNA gene of the first  \n\n\n\n 7\n\nTable I.

The third probe corresponded to a 1400 bp-segment of the 18S rRNA \n\ngene obtained by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nuclear DNA \n\n(Cioffi et al., 2009). The probes were labelled by nick-translation with biotin-\n\n14-dATP (Bionick Labeling System-Invitrogen). Signal detection and its \n\namplification were performed using conjugated avidin-FITC and anti-avidin-\n\nbiotin (Sigma). The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide \n\n(50 ?g mL-1136) and analyzed with an Olympus BX50 epifluorescence \n\nmicroscope. The chromosomal images were captured using CoolSNAP-Pro \n\nsoftware (Media Cybernetics). About 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed \n\nper specimen to determine the diploid chromosome number and karyotypic \n\nstructure. Chromosomes were classified as metacentrics (m) or \n\nsubmetacentrics (sm), according to centromeric index values proposed by \n\nLevan et al. (1964). \n\n \n\n3.4 DNA EXTRACTION AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nDNA extraction followed Boyce et al. (1989). Fragments of ATPase 6 \n\nwere amplified using primers L8524 (5\u2019-AAY CCT GAR ACT GAC CAT G- 3\u2019) \n\nand H9236 (5\u2019-GTT AGT GGT CAK GGG CTT GGR TC- 3\u2019) (Quenouille et \n\nal., 2004). Double stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?L reactions \n\ncontaining 10 ?L dNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?L reaction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH \n\n8\u00b74, 500 148 mM KCl), 2 ?L MgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?L of each primer (10 mM), \n\n0\u00b75 ?L (2\u00b75 U) of Taq DNA polymerase ( Phoneutria ), 2 ?L of template DNA \n\n(100 ng/?L) and 26\u00b75 ?L of H2O. PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0 C (2 \n\nmin), 5 cycles of 94\u00b0 C (45 s), 54\u00b0 C (45 s), 72\u00b0 C (1.5 min), 29 cycles of 94\u00b0 \n\nC (45 s), 58\u00b0 C (45 s), 72\u00b0 C (1\u00b75 min). PCR products were purified using \n\nQiaquick (Qiagen): 5 ?L of the purified PCR product were used in a 10 ?L \n\ncycle sequencing reaction using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing \n\nkit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W \n\n1.83 in MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007). Phylogenetic trees were constructed \n\nwith neighbour joining (NJ) (Saitou &amp; Nei, 1987), maximum parsimony (MP), \n\nmaximum likelihood (ML) (Felsenstein, 1981) and Bayesian inference (MB) \n\n(Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist, 2001). The model of molecular evolution that best \n\n\n\n 10\n\nfitted the data was chosen using Modeltest 3.7 (Posada &amp; Crandall, 1998), \n\nand haplotype divergence was estimated within and between haplogroups \n\nusing this selected model. Phylogenetic signal in NJ, MP and ML trees was \n\nassessed using bootstraps with 1000 repetitions. Bayesian inference was \n\nperformed with 5 million MCMC steps to produce posterior probabilities of \n\nnodes in the tree with Mr Bayes. Hoplias lacerdae Miranda Ribeiro, 1908 was \n\nused as an outgroup. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession \n\nnumbers GQ848606\u2013GQ848642). \n\n \n\n4. RESULTS \n \n\n4.1 KARYOTYPIC DATA \n\n \n\nKaryomorph 2n=40F \n\nAll specimens from the Pandeiros and Par\u00e1 rivers (except those from \n\nPar\u00e1\u2019s headwaters, in Tombadouro Creek) had 2n=40 chromosomes for both \n\nsexes. The karyotypes were composed of 10 m + 10 sm pairs, without \n\nmorphologically differentiated sex chromosomes using Giemsa conventional \n\nstaining (Fig. 2a), and were typical 2n=40F karyomorphs. C-banding showed \n\nheterochromatic blocks in centromeric regions, except for chromosome pairs \n\nNos. 9 and 10, which had less conspicuous blocks, in addition to faint \n\ntelomeric marks in some chromosome pairs. Males always showed an \n\ninterstitial heterochromatic block in the short arms of one homologue of the \n\nfirst chromosome pair (Fig. 2c), whereas females lacked this block (Fig. 2e). \n\nThis heterochromatic region was negative for DAPI staining but failed to \n\nshow fluorescence with CMA3. A proximal heterochromatic block located on \n\nthe short arms of a small submetacentric pair was the only observed GC-rich \n\nsegment in both populations (Fig. 3f, i). Ag-NORs were telomeric, and their \n\nnumbers were either fixed (four in the Par\u00e1 River) or varied from 4 to 5 \n\n(Pandeiros River) (Fig. 4a, b). FISH analyses with the repetitive sequences \n\nshowed no differences between these two populations. The 18S rDNA probe \n\nhybridized on the pericentromeric region of one metacentric pair and on the \n\ntelomeric regions of two submetacentric pairs (Fig. 3a). The 5S rDNA probe \n\nhybridized on the pericentromeric region of a medium-sized metacentric pair \n\n\n\n 11\n\n(Fig. 3c). The repetitive 5SHindIII-DNA was mapped in the centromeric \n\nregion of 10 chromosome pairs (Fig. 5a). Although Ibimirim samples were not \n\nkaryotyped, they were collected in a region with populations characterized by \n\n2n=40F karyomorph and were assumed to share this karyomorph. \n\n \n\nKaryomorph 2n=42A \n\nIn the headwaters of Tombadouro Creek, all specimens had 2n=42 \n\nchromosomes, with a karyotype consisting of 11 m + 10 sm pairs, without \n\nmorphologically differentiated sex chromosomes (Fig. 2b), and were \n\nconsidered to be typical 2n=42A karyomorphs. Besides some telomeric \n\nmarks, conspicuous heterochromatic bands were found in the centromeric \n\nregion of all chromosomes, except for chromosome pairs No. 6, 19 and 20, \n\nwhich showed faint blocks (Fig. 2d). Ag-NORs varied among and within \n\nindividuals (1\u20132 pairs), and bitelomeric NORs were evident in either 1 or 2 \n\nchromosomes (Fig. 4c). In this population, the 18S rDNA probe hybridized on \n\nthree chromosome pairs, with interstitial, telomeric and bi-telomeric sites (Fig. \n\n3b). The 5S rDNA probe hybridized on the interstitial region of a large \n\nsubmetacentric pair (Fig. 3d). The repetitive 5SHindIII-DNA probe bound to \n\nthe centromeric region of nine chromosome pairs (Fig. 5b). \n\n \n\nSpecimens from the Jacar\u00e9 River in the Grande drainage, had 2n=42 \n\nkaryomorphs composed of 11 m + 10 sm pairs, without morphologically \n\ndifferentiated sex chromosomes (Fig. 2b) and represented a typical 2n=42A \n\nkaryomorph. Heterochromatic blocks were centromeric in most \n\nchromosomes, except for pairs No. 6, 8, 11, 19 and 20, which showed faint \n\nbands, in addition to telomeric marks in some chromosome pairs (Fig. 2f). \n\nAg-NORs were restricted to telomeric regions of two chromosomes (Fig. 4d). \n\nFluorescent regions hybridized with 18S rDNA and 5SHindIII-DNA and \n\nshowed a pattern similar to the Tombadouro Creek sample. Additionally, the \n\n5S rDNA probe hybridized on the interstitial region of a small metacentric pair \n\n(Fig. 3e). As was the case with the Ibimirim samples, Paranagu\u00e1 and Macacu \n\nsamples were collected within the range of 2n=42A populations (JAD \n\nunpublished data) and were therefore assumed to be derive from these \n\npopulations. \n\n\n\n 12\n\n \n \n\nFIG. 2.

Bar = 5 ?m. \n\n \n\n4.2 MOLECULAR DATA \n\n \n\nMultiple sequences 511 bp in length yielded 86 parsimony informative \n\nsites. Translation of these sequences into the corresponding amino acid \n\n\n\n 16\n\nsequences resulted in 8 parsimony informative sites. The \n\ntransitions:transversions ratio was 6.4, indicating that substitution rates were \n\nnot saturated. The best model fit estimated with Modeltest and MrModeltest \n\nwas HKY+G, which was used for NJ. In the tree, haplotypes were separated \n\ninto 2 large clades with variable bootstrap support (Fig. 6). The largest \n\nbootstrap values were obtained for Haplogroup I, which was composed of the \n\n2n=42A karyomorph from Tombadouro Creek, Ribeira, Paranagu\u00e1 and \n\nMacacu rivers (Fig. 1). Haplogroup II was less supported and included all \n\nremaining trahiras (N = 67), regardless of diploid number. Within this \n\nhaplogroup, two subclades were highly supported: haplotypes derived from \n\npopulations with the 2n=40F karyomorph (haplogroup IIA) and from \n\npopulations with 2n=42A and 2n=42B karyomorphs (haplogroup IIB). \n\nHaplogroup IIA included all 2n=40 S\u00e3o Francisco trahiras, plus the Itapicuru \n\nRiver specimen. Haplogroup IIB included two well-defined lineages: one \n\nincluded haplotypes from the Doce and S\u00e3o Mateus rivers with no \n\nrepresentatives in the Grande River, and a second lineage indicated a close \n\nphylogenetic relatedness between trahiras from the Jacar\u00e9 (Grande River), \n\nthe Tombadouro (S\u00e3o Francisco River) and the Maca\u00e9, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, \n\nItabapoana and Para\u00edba do Sul coastal basins. Within-haplogroup nucleotide \n\nmolecular distances showed high levels of variation, with the smallest values \n\nin the S\u00e3o Francisco and Itapicuru samples and the largest in the IIB \n\nhaplogroup. The range of between-haplogroup variation was much smaller \n\n(Table II). \n\n \nTable II.

DISCUSSION \n \n\n5.1 KARYOTYPIC DATA \n\n \n\nKaryomorph 2n = 40F \n\n \n\nIn addition to specimens from Tombadouro Creek, all samples from \n\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco drainage shared the same karyomorphic formula, which is \n\nconsidered to be characteristic for S\u00e3o Francisco Basin populations (Bertollo \n\net al., 2000). The distributional pattern of heterochromatin was similar to that \n\ndescribed by Dergam &amp; Bertollo (1990) for the Tr\u00eas Marias population in this \n\nbasin (Fig. 1), except for the presence of a heterochromatic block that was \n\nalways restricted to one homologue of the first chromosome pair in males. \n\nThis pattern suggested a probable XX/XY sex chromosome system in these \n\npopulations, because this variant occurred only in males and was absent in \n\nfemales. This sex chromosome differentiation involving only \n\nheterochromatinization is a novelty within H. malabaricus, because all other \n\nsex chromosome systems described for this species complex involve \n\ntranslocations between chromosome pairs (for example, karyomorphs \n\n2n=39/40D and 2n=40/41G) (Bertollo et al., 2000), or translocation and \n\nheterochromatinization, as proposed for the evolution of the 2n=42B \n\nkaryomorph from a 2n=42A karyomorph ancestor (Born &amp; Bertollo, 2000). \n\nThe 2n=40/41G karyomorph also has a large first pair of metacentrics and is \n\ntherefore morphologically closest to the 2n=40F karyomorph. Females with \n\nboth karyomorphs have identical karyotypes and may be sister karyomorphs \n\nor species. Ongoing studies including these karyomorphs, using additional \n\nchromosomal markers will allow for a more thorough hypothesis of the \n\nevolutionary origins of this sex chromosome system. \n\n \n\n\n\n 19\n\nC-positive heterochromatic bands were always located in the \n\ncentromeric/pericentromeric region of all chromosomes and in the telomeric \n\nregion of some pairs, in addition to multiple Ag- NORs sites. These \n\nheterochromatic and NOR characteristics were similar to those reported for \n\nother populations or karyomorphs of H. malabaricus (Dergam &amp; Bertollo, \n\n1990; Haaf et al., 1993; Bertollo, 1996; Bertollo et al., 1997; Born &amp; Bertollo, \n\n2000; Vicari et al., 2003; Vicari et al., 2005). In the Pandeiros River sample, \n\nAg-NORs were restricted to telomeres of some chromosomes and appeared \n\nin larger numbers than 18S rDNA sites, but the latter also hybridized to the \n\npericentromeric region of 1 chromosome pair (Fig. 3 a). There is currently no \n\nexplanation for the apparently nonspecific nature of some telomeric Ag-\n\nNORs in the Pandeiros sample, which is as large as 7 in the Tr\u00eas Marias \n\nregion (Dergam &amp; Bertollo, 1990). On the other hand, pericentromeric 18S \n\nrDNA sites were not visualized by the silver nitrate method (these data and \n\nDergam &amp; Bertollo, 1990), which may be due to preferential telomeric NOR \n\nactivation, as already pointed out for other trahiras\u2019 karyomorphs (Vicari et \n\nal., 2005). Hybridization sites of the 5S rDNA probe were interstitially located \n\nin a small metacentric pair in both populations, a pattern also reported for \n\ntrahira samples from Tr\u00eas Marias (Ferreira et al., 2007). The patterns \n\nobtained with repetitive DNA class 5SHindIII-DNA were similar to those \n\nobtained for the Tr\u00eas Marias population (Ferreira et al.,2007). \n\n \n\nKaryomorph 2n=42A \n\n \n\nThe karyotypes of specimens from Tombadouro Creek and Jacar\u00e9 \n\nRiver were characterized as karyomorph 2n=42A, a widespread karyotypic \n\nform in the Neotropics (Bertollo et al., 2000). C-banding evidenced \n\nconspicuous centromeric blocks in almost all chromosomes, an overall \n\npattern also reported by Born &amp; Bertollo (2001) for other Grande River \n\n2n=42A populations. High levels of Ag-NOR variation observed in the \n\nTombadouro Creek population have also been reported elsewhere in the \n\nGrande River Basin (Born &amp; Bertollo, 2001). Jacar\u00e9 River trahiras showed \n\nAg-NORs restricted to 1 chromosome pair, characterizing the lowest number \n\nof activated NORs reported so far as a fixed character state for any H. \n\n\n\n 20\n\nmalabaricus population. However, FISH with an 18S rDNA probe showed a \n\nlarger number of NORs cistrons in both 2n=42A karyomorph populations. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, FISH mapping with a 5S rDNA probe revealed \n\ndifferences between the Tombadouro Creek and the Jacar\u00e9 River \n\npopulations, where they hybridized on a large submetacentric and a small \n\nmetacentric pair, respectively. This difference contrasted with previous \n\nreports of other trahira populations from the Upper Paran\u00e1 Basin, the Aragu\u00e1 \n\nRiver, where both pairs showed fluorescence with this probe (Martins et al. \n\n2006). Considering that at least some specimens from both basins shared \n\nidentical haplotypes (see below), these population differences highlighted the \n\ngreat potential of this probe for population studies. \n\n \n\nPatterns of variation of 18S rDNA were substantially different from the \n\nones reported by Cioffi et al. (2009). These authors indicated the presence of \n\nfive sites in the 2n=42B karyomorph and four fluorescent sites in a 2n=42A \n\nkaryomorph from the Upper Paran\u00e1 Basin, whereas the results of this study \n\nshowed that the same karyomorph in the Jacar\u00e9 and Tombadouro \n\npopulations had three fluorescent sites. This reduction in numbers was also \n\nevident in the 2n=40F karyomorph, when compared to the 2n=40C and \n\n2n=39/40D karyomorphs, which showed five fluorescent sites. Thus, this \n\nprobe appears to be especially informative for studying among-karyomorph \n\nvariation. \n\n \n\nAccording to the haplotype-based trees, 5SHindIII-DNA patterns \n\nreflected a small increase in site numbers (from 18 to 20); Cioffi et al. (2009) \n\nalso found variation in site numbers for other 2n=42 and 2n=40 populations. \n\nAlso, the fluorescent centromeric region in the first or second chromosome \n\npairs appears to be particularly informative. The presence of the fluorescent \n\nregion in the first chromosome pair was observed in the 2n=42A karyomorph, \n\nas is the case for 2n=42B, 2n=40C and 2n=39/40D karyomorphs (Cioffi et al., \n\n2009), representing a plesiomorphic state. On the other hand, the 2n=40F \n\nkaryomorph showed an apparently apomorphic condition, where the \n\nfluorescent region occurred in the second chromosome pair. Absence of the \n\n\n\n 21\n\nfluorescent site in the first chromosome pair might be attributed to a more \n\nrecent origin of the first chromosome pair and its possible origin from \n\nchromosomes lacking this site. However, this hypothesis involves a \n\nparticularly complex evolutionary process, because the persistence of diploid \n\nnumber would also involve alterations of other chromosome pairs. \n\nAlternatively, the 2n=40F karyomorph might have evolved directly from a \n\n2n=42A ancestor, causing a reduction in diploid number and producing an \n\nindependent 2n=40 lineage. This hypothesis is consistent with the hypothesis \n\nof Bertollo et al. (2000), based on gross chromosome morphology, that the \n\n2n=40F, 2n=40/41G and 2n=42E karyomorphs represent a monophyletic \n\ngroup within H. malabaricus. \n\n \n\nIn the submetacentric chromosome group, the pattern of fluorescent \n\ncentromeric sites in three major chromosome pairs also sets apart the \n\n2n=40F karyomorph from other karyomorphs. The 2n=42A karyomorph and \n\nthe three karyomorphs reported by Cioffi et al. (2009) have conspicuous \n\nfluorescent centromeric regions in these pairs, while this number was \n\nreduced to two pairs in the 2n=40F karyomorph. Homeologies among other \n\nchromosome pairs seem less reliable and must await further data. These \n\nFISH results and the presence of a unique sex chromosome system clearly \n\nindicate that the 2n=40F karyomorph is a taxon with the largest suit of \n\nderived karyotypic characters in this species complex. \n\n \n\n5.2 MOLECULAR DATA \n\n \n\nMolecular data are congruent with the cytogenetic results and suggest \n\na long reproductive isolation between the karyomorphs. Haplogroup I \n\nincluded some of the 2n=42A karyomorph haplotypes from the Tombadouro \n\nCreek and haplotypes derived from three coastal basins located south of the \n\nPara\u00edba do Sul River. This haplogroup showed low levels of within variation, \n\nsuggesting that these haplotypes were closely related. Some haplogroup II \n\nhaplotypes were sympatric with haplogroup I haplotypes at the Tombadouro \n\nCreek. Within haplogroup IIB, all haplotypes from the Grande River were \n\nclosely related to haplotypes from four coastal basins. These haplotypes \n\n\n\n 22\n\nshowed a sister group relationship with haplotypes from the S\u00e3o Mateus and \n\nDoce coastal basins that were not represented in samples from the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco and Grande rivers. Some 2n=42 trahiras from the Tombadouro \n\nCreek and Jacar\u00e9 River shared identical haplotypes, suggesting a recent \n\nrange expansion from the Grande to the S\u00e3o Francisco basins. \n\n \n\nThese results provide insights into the evolution of H. malabaricus \n\nkaryomorphs and the history of contact between coastal and continental \n\nhydrological basins. The most inclusive study of ND2 and ATPase 6 \n\ndivergence between freshwater fishes is Bermingham et al. (1997), who \n\nestimated a rate of divergence for this gene segment of 1.3% per million \n\nyears. Overall sequence (p-distance) divergence of the divergent haplogroup \n\nI haplotypes versus haplogroup II haplotypes would suggest a lineage split at \n\n4.2 million years ago, an age that is younger than the inferred Amazon-\n\nParanean vicariance, which has been dated at 11.8\u201310 million years ago \n\n(reviewed in Lundberg et al., 1998). This isolation left 2n=42 and 2n=40 \n\nkaryomorphs in both basins (Bertollo et al., 2000), indicating that karyotypic \n\nevolution was well underway during Late Miocene Epoch. Miocene fossils are \n\nalso considered to be similar to present-day taxa (Lundberg, 1998). The \n\ninformation content of molecular variation of this species complex may be \n\nmore elusive: a preliminary analysis of ATPase 6 sequences in H. \n\nmalabaricus populations from the Amazon-Paranean boundary basins \n\nreveals two clades that show large differences in p-distance divergence \n\nwithin each clade (0.10 and 0.34% per million years, respectively) (JAD, \n\nunpublished data), suggesting that molecular evolution within the H. \n\nmalabaricus complex may be highly variable and influenced by other causes. \n\nFactors such as efficiency in DNA repair mechanism (Britten, 1986), \n\ngeneration time (Wu &amp; Li, 1985), metabolic rate (Martin &amp; Palumbi, 1993) and \n\ndemographic processes (Ohta, 2002) may affect substitution rates among \n\ntaxa. Hence, it is plausible to hypothesize a strong effect of demographic \n\nprocesses on the rates of molecular substitution in these populations, \n\nconsidering the close phylogenetic relationships among H. malabaricus \n\nkaryomorphs and the adaptation of trahiras to life in small populations\u2013which \n\nis also reflected in their high levels of karyotypical variation. Slightly \n\n\n\n 23\n\ndisadvantageous substitutions can drift to high frequencies in small \n\npopulations (Ohta, 2002), thereby altering substitution rates in the DNA. \n\nTherefore, trahiras and other species with similar ecology may be particularly \n\npoor candidates for using the molecular clock hypothesis to estimate \n\ndivergence times. In the highly migratory species, Prochilodus spp., \n\nsubstitution rates of ATPase 6,8 range from 0.8\u20132.5% (Sivasundar et al., \n\n2001), suggesting haplotypes in H. malabaricus are among the most \n\ndivergent in the Neotropical region. The present study is the first to indicate \n\nsuch a deep molecular divergence within the same karyomorph, although \n\ndeep cytochrome b divergences were also observed among populations of \n\nthe catfish Pimelodus albicans in the River Plate Basin (Vergara et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe location where lineage splitting occurred is limited to the \n\ndistribution of current karyomorphs. The Paran\u00e1 Basin harbours at least three \n\nkaryomorphs, while the 2n=40F karyomorph appears to be widespread in the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco Basin, and the 2n=42A karyomorph is apparently restricted to \n\nthe Par\u00e1 River headwaters. North-eastern coastal populations harbour the \n\n2n=40F karyomorph as far as the Buranh\u00e9m River to the south (JAD, \n\nunpubl.) (Fig. 1), and these haplotypes had the lowest degree of divergence. \n\nThis macro-geographical pattern suggests that lineage splitting occurred \n\nelsewhere and not in the relatively isolated S\u00e3o Francisco Basin. In \n\nhaplogroup IIB, the close relationship between the 2n=42A and 2n=42B \n\nkaryomorphs indicated that karyotypical differentiation involved few \n\nalterations that resulted in a differentiated XX/XY chromosome system \n\n(Bertollo et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n5.3 STREAM PIRACY \n\n \n\nOn a local scale, the apparently restricted range of the Tombadouro \n\nCreek 2n=42A karyomorph may have resulted from stream piracy from a \n\nformer Jacar\u00e9 River tributary. The Tombadouro Creek is 12 km from the \n\nJacar\u00e9 across the Galga water Divisor. Three hypotheses might explain this \n\ndispersal. First, boundary crossing may have resulted from either human \n\nmediated activities. For example, the connection may have been destroyed \n\n\n\n 24\n\nby the construction of BR 494 Highway, which is 8 km away at its closest \n\npoint from the Tombadouro Creek. Second, dispersal may have occurred \n\nthrough a high-altitude wetland that used to drain into both basins. Third, \n\nheadwater capture in the region may have occurred by relatively recent \n\nreactivation of ancient faults (Saadi et al., 2002). Altitudinal characteristics \n\nare also consistent with the direction of stream capture. Tombadouro is at \n\n860 m altitude, whereas the Jacar\u00e9 River is at 1038 m. This area is within the \n\nrange of a continental fault known as the Upper Grande River Crustal \n\nDiscontinuity (Saadi et al., 2002). This fault represents the southern limit of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco craton and the movable belts of southern Minas Gerais \n\nState (Fig. 1) and has been active in the last 15 000 years. \n\n \n\nThe phylogenetic origins of two highly divergent haplotypes in the \n\nTombadouro Creek became clear only after haplotypes from coastal basins \n\nwere included in the analysis. Most critically, haplotypes found in sympatry in \n\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco River are related to haplotypes in different coastal basins. \n\nUnder the allopatric model of speciation, this asymmetry suggests that \n\nancestral fish dispersed from the coastal to the continental drainages, and \n\nthe present study is the first to indicate unambiguously the direction of this \n\ndispersal. However, the timing of the dispersal between coastal and inland \n\ndrainages could not be estimated, because molecular clock expectations are \n\nnot suitable for trahiras. Therefore, the phylogeographic history this group \n\ndoes not fit any of the three phylogenetic patterns proposed by Ribeiro \n\n(2006). On the other hand, low genetic divergence between the S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco and Itapicuru drainages may be part of a recent faunal exchange \n\nin the arid region of north-eastern Brazil that is apparent in many other \n\nspecies of fish (Rosa et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nRibeiro (2006) indicated that the Atlantic drainages (Doce, Para\u00edba do \n\nSul and Ribeira) have existed since the breakup of Gondwana. The results of \n\nthe present study suggested that populations in these basins represent three \n\nbiogeographic units, for which only two have close representatives in the \n\nboundaries of the Jacar\u00e9 and Par\u00e1 drainages. Dergam et al. (2002) \n\npreviously reported a close phylogenetic relatedness between two \n\n\n\n 25\n\nhaplotypes in the Doce and lower Grande river basins. Fish dispersal from \n\ncoastal to continental drainages may have been restricted to only a few taxa \n\nadapted to headwater conditions, because coastal drainages are \n\ncharacterized by high levels of endemism (Ribeiro, 2006) and the Proterozoic \n\nMantiqueira Range is considered to be an efficient barrier between coastal \n\nand continental drainages (Ingenito &amp; Buckup, 2007). To the south, stream \n\npiracy has been particularly intensive in the Para\u00edba do Sul, Ribeira and \n\nUpper Paran\u00e1 basins (Ribeiro, 2006). \n\n \n\nThe present study provided important information on the population \n\ndistribution of H. malabaricus in S\u00e3o Francisco Basin and on historical \n\nrelationships with populations in the Grande and coastal basins. The 2n=40F \n\nkaryomorph and its associated haplotypes were widely distributed throughout \n\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco Basin, maintaining an apparently stable karyotypic \n\nstructure of the chromosomal markers analyzed here. This karyomorph was \n\ncharacterized by a XX/XY sex chromosome system. In contrast, the 2n=42A \n\nkaryomorph showed a more restricted distribution in S\u00e3o Francisco Basin \n\nand was closely associated with populations in a Grande River Basin \n\ntributary, where the 2n=42A karyomorph predominated. However, the \n\n2n=42A karyomorph populations isolated in drainages showed striking \n\ndifferences for some markers, notably the Ag-NORs and 5S rDNA sites. The \n\npatterns of variation in repetitive DNA sequences as revealed by 5S rDNA \n\nprobes indicated that these markers appeared to be useful population \n\nmarkers, showing significant differences among localities and karyomorphs. \n\nPatterns of 5SHindIII-DNA variation yielded the largest phylogenetic signal \n\nand placed the 2n=40F karyomorph in a high position in the phylogeny of \n\nkaryomorphs that occur in eastern Brazil. \n\n \n\nGiven the current status of phylogenetic data, an understanding of \n\ndistribution patterns for H. malabaricus will be particularly challenging. \n\nStudies of the distribution patterns of freshwater fishes have considered \n\nendemism (e.g. Vari, 1988), faunal composition including endemic and \n\nwidespread species (Hubert &amp; Renno, 2006), molecular data (Sivasundar et \n\nal., 2001; Montoya-Burgos, 2003) or a combination of morphological and \n\n\n\n 26\n\nmolecular data (Menezes et al., 2008). When integrated into a wider \n\ngeographic context, molecular and cytogenetic patterns can be informative of \n\nfaunal dispersals between drainages. The results of the present study \n\nsuggested that recent fish dispersal may occur even within apparently stable \n\ngeological regions and that headwater stream piracy between coastal and \n\ncontinental (Upper Paran\u00e1 tributaries) basins may have played a role in \n\nproducing the high levels of freshwater fish diversity in the Neotropics. \n\n \n\nFinally, the topology of mtDNA-based tree suggests that the proposal \n\nof Dergam &amp; Bertollo (1990) to separate species by diploid numbers would \n\nresult in a paraphyletic arrangement, in which some trahiras haplotypes \n\nassociated with 2n=42 karyomorphs would be more closely related to trahiras \n\nwith 2n=40 karyomorphs than to other fish with 2n=42 karyomorphs. \n\nAlthough haplogroup I appeared as the sister group of the remaining trahiras, \n\nhaplogroup II is less supported and the possible ancestry of karyomorphs \n\nmust wait for more data. A time frame for dispersal between coastal and \n\ncontinental drainages is elusive for the H. malabaricus species complex. \n\nNevertheless, geographical isolation during coastal diversification has \n\nenhanced speciation processes and genetic isolation between karyomorphs, \n\na process that has resulted in molecular and cytogenetic differentiation \n\nbetween populations. These results are consistent with the existence of \n\nmultiple independent lineages that can be easily detected with standard \n\ncytogenetic techniques. \n\n \n\nAlthough trahiras are common members of lowland freshwater \n\ncommunities (Bonetto et al., 1969; Winemiller, 1991), at least part of their \n\nwidespread distribution in the Neotropics is due to their ability to dwell in \n\nhigh-altitude headwaters, such as in the Jacar\u00e9 and Tombadouro localities. \n\nThe question of how this nonmigratory sedentary species has adapted to \n\nsluggish waters and to waters in high altitudes is not explained by current \n\ngeological data. Nevertheless, this broad ecological diversity indicates a long \n\nhistory of trahiras in south-eastern Brazil. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 27\n\nJos\u00e9 Tiago da Costa, Jo\u00e3o Batista Santos, Sr. Raul de F.
