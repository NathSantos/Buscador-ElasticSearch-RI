Biotic and abiotic parameters of environment inhabited by Aspidoras fuscoguttatus, associated\nichthyofauna, as well as strategies involved in the successful occupation of different microhabitats in a first\norder stream, located in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo State, were investigated. Data collection was monthly\nperformed at three segments (headwaters, middle course, and mouth) from August 1999 to July 2000. The\ngreatest values of water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, width, depth, and current velocity\nwere obtained in the rainy season. Dissolved oxygen levels showed significant differences among three\nsegments in all sampling months, except for September. Substrate composition was predominantly sandy,\nfollowed by silt and clay in middle course and mouth in rainy as much as in dry seasons. In headwaters a\nlarge increase of the sandy fraction occurred in the rainy season. In the marginal and aquatic vegetation 30\nspecies of macrophytes and 5 of macroalgae were identified. The fauna included tadpoles of Anura and\nmacroinvertebrates (Mollusca, Crustacea, Arachnida, and 8 orders of Insecta). A. fuscoguttatus was found\nthroughout the entire stream in sympatry with 6 fish species. In middle course, cluster analysis revealed an\nassociation between A. fuscoguttatus immatures and low depth, suggesting a probable function of depth in\nthat stage of ontogenetic development of catfishes. The results indicate that A. fuscoguttatus present plasticity\nin terms of microhabitat, including air breathing behavior in hypoxic conditions, previously unknown in\ngenus Aspidoras.\n\nKey words: ecology, stream, microhabitat, Aspidoras fuscoguttatus, Callichthyidae.\n\nRESUMO\n\nEcologia de um riacho da bacia do alto rio Paran\u00e1 habitado por Aspidoras fuscoguttatus\nNijssen &amp; Isbr\u00fccker, 1976 (Siluriformes, Callichthyidae)\n\nA maioria das informa\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis sobre cascudos do g\u00eanero Aspidoras \u00e9 proveniente de observa\u00e7\u00f5es\nem aqu\u00e1rio.

However, knowledge\nabout the ecology and systematics of its fish com-\nmunities is relatively incomplete and geographically\nrestricted (B\u00f6hlke et al., 1978; Lowe-McConnell,\n1999). The main groups of Neotropical freshwater\nfishes include Characiformes, Siluriformes, Gymno-\ntiformes, Cyprinodontiformes and Cichlidae (Britski\net al., 1999). Siluriformes constitutes one of the\ndominant groups, with 15 families (Nelson, 1994).\nOne of them, the Callichthyidae comprehends small\narmored South American catfishes characterized by\nthe presence of two lateral and longitudinal series\nof body plates, three pairs of barbels and anterior\nmouth. This family has approximately 165 species,\n8 genera and 2 subfamilies: Callichthyinae (Callichthys,\nDianema, Hoplosternum, Lepthoplosternum and\nMegalechis) and Corydoradinae (Aspidoras,\nCorydoras and Brochis) (Reis, 1998).\n\nIn Callichthyinae some biological aspects have\nbeen investigated as feeding (Saul, 1974) in\nCallichthys callichthys (Linnaeus, 1758); repro-\nduction (Ramnarine, 1995), behavior (Andrade &amp;\nAbe, 1997) and ontogenetical development (Ma-\nchado-Allison, 1986) in Hoplosternum littorale\n(Hancock, 1828), and ecology (Mol, 1996) in H.\nthoracatum (Valenciennes, 1840). In Corydoradinae\nfew studies were made regarding spatial occupation,\nfeeding and reproductive period (Aranha et al., 1993)\nin Corydoras aeneus (Gill, 1858) and Corydoras\n\ngr. carlae Isbr\u00fccker, 1983, and populational\ndynamics (Bervian &amp; Fontoura, 1994) and\nreproductive behavior (Pruzsinszky &amp; Ladich, 1998)\nin C. paleatus (Jenyns, 1842).\n\nMost information available on catfishes of\nthe genus Aspidoras are restricted to the species\nkept in aquaria, in non-natural conditions (Burgess,\n1989). According to Britto (2000), almost all 17\nAspidoras species occur in limited areas of some\nhigher Brazilian river drainages, suggesting strong\nendemism (Nijssen &amp; Isbr\u00fccker, 1976). Ecological\nstudies on this genus, in natural environment, are\nscarce in Brazil. The only contribution dealing with\nAspidoras fuscoguttatus Nijssen &amp; Isbr\u00fccker, 1976\nis that of Garutti (1988), analysing the longitudinal\ndistribution of fish fauna in a stream from\nnorthwestern region of S\u00e3o Paulo State.\nFurthermore, there are still relatively few papers\ncontaining an ecological characterization of\nheadwaters and streams from plateau areas\ninhabited primarily by small size fish species as\nA. fuscoguttatus, including main aquatic biotic and\nabiotic parameters.\n\nKeeping this in mind, the aims of this work\nwere: 1) to describe the aquatic environment\noccupied by A. fuscoguttatus (Fig. 1) focusing its\nmain biotic and abiotic characteristics; 2) to make\na survey of the fish species that occur in that\nenvironment; and 3) to investigate the possible\nstrategies involved in the successful occupation by\nA. fuscoguttatus of different microhabitats in a small\nstream.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 63(3): 363-372, 2003\n\nECOLOGY OF A STREAM INHABITED BY Aspidoras fuscoguttatus 365\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy area\nThe field work was carried out in a nameless\n\nstream situated in Engenheiro Schmidt, a district of\nS\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo State,  20o52\u201906\u201dS-\n49o16\u201940\u201dW. It is a first order stream according to\nStrahler (1957), typical of plateau region, draining\ninto a larger stream (Cedro Stream), which in turn\nis a tributary of Preto River, draining into the Turvo\nRiver. The Turvo River basin is part of the large\nGrande River drainage basin, which belongs to the\nParan\u00e1 River basin.\n\nThe regional topography is gentle and the relief\nis undulated and relatively uniform. Total slope is\nrelatively small, the highest altitude reaching 550\nm and the lowest 350 m. The soils are sandy and\nresult from rock decomposition of Bauru Formation,\nwith predominance of the sandy portion and a lower\ncontribution of the finer (silt-clay) portion (Arid et\nal., 1970).\n\nThe original vegetation in the region of S\u00e3o\nJos\u00e9 do Rio Preto is almost entirely restricted to\nthe semi-deciduous marginal forests along the rivers\nor stream courses. A recent survey made by the\nSecretaria de Agricultura, S\u00e3o Paulo State, showed\nthe following proportions of the land use in that\nregion: 63% pastures, 6.4% annual cultured areas,\n\n20% permanent cultured areas, 8% forests, and\n2.6% unused or reforested areas.\n\nThe regional climate is the warm-moist tro-\npical type (Arid et al., 1970). The mean annual\ntemperatures are always higher than 25\u00baC, whereas\nthe mean of the coolest months (June and July) is\nabout 20\u00baC, and of the warmest months (January\nand February) is about 30\u00baC. Annual rainfall range\nfrom 1100 to 1250 mm, with a high concentration\n(85%) from October to March, the rainy season, and\na low concentration (15%) from April to September,\nthe dry season (Arid &amp; Barcha, 1973).\n\nSample collection\nAll material was monthly sampled at three stream\n\nsegments (headwaters, middle course, and mouth) from\nAugust 1999 to July 2000, except for January. Sampling\nwas performed in the morning, between 7:10 and 11:40\nam, in order to avoid diel variation of water physical\nand chemical parameters. Preliminary observations\nand collecting were undertaken from February to July\n1999. Temperature was measured directly in the water\nat a depth of 10 cm using a mercury thermometer\n(\u201310\u00baC to 110\u00baC). Specific conductivity was determined\nwith a Crison field conductivimeter, model 524. Water\nsamples were collected and transported to the laboratory\nfor measurement of pH, turbidity, alkalinity, and\ndissolved oxygen.\n\nFig. 1 \u2014 Aspidoras fuscoguttatus, DZSJRP 4419, 54 mm TL, female, collected in a tributary stream of Cedro Stream on 19\nFebruary 2000.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 63(3): 363-372, 2003\n\n366 ARAUJO, R. B. de and GARUTTI, V.\n\nMeasurements of pH were determined with\na Mettler Toledo digital pH-meter, model MP 220.\nDissolved oxygen (mg L\u20131) was determined by\nWinkler method (Golterman et al., 1978). Alkalinity\n(mg L\u20131) was analysed by potentiometric titration\naccording to Golterman et al. (1978). Turbidity\n(FTU) was measured with a Micronal turbidimeter,\nmodel B 250. All laboratory analyses for chemical\nand physical variables were performed on the same\ncollection day with only one measurement, except\nfor dissolved oxygen which was measured in three\nrepetitions. Rainfall data were obtained from Es-\ncrit\u00f3rio de Desenvolvimento Rural, Coordenadoria\nde Assist\u00eancia T\u00e9cnica Integral, S\u00e3o Paulo State,\nsituated in Cedral, a town at a distance of 4 km from\nthe sampling site.\n\nFishes were collected with sieve (0.3 x 0.3\nmm), casting net (0.9 x 0.9 mm), hand net (0.5 x\n0.5 mm) and fish line. Vascular plants (terrestrial\nand aquatic macrophytes), macroalgae and substrate\nwere sampled manually and with the aid of a small\nspade.\n\nThe fishes were fixed in 10% formaldehyde\nsolution and after 48 hours transferred to 70%\nethanol solution for permanent storage. Algae were\npreserved in 4% buffered formaldehyde. In the\nlaboratory, total length (TL) was taken with a calliper.\nVoucher specimens were deposited in the fish\ncollection of Departamento de Zoologia e Bot\u00e2nica,\nUNESP, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto (DZSJRP 4414 to\n4434 and 4436 to 4457).\n\nFor the microhabitat characterization, width\nand depth (measured with tape-measure), current\nvelocity (estimated by the method of dislocation of\na floating object), marginal and aquatic vegetation,\nand associated fauna (tadpoles and macroinver-\ntebrates) were recorded. Two substrate samples,\ncollected in May 1999 (dry season) and February\n2000 (rain season), were analysed according to\nparticle size classes by Allan (1995).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in means for values of dissolved\n\noxygen among the stream segments (headwaters,\nmiddle course and mouth) were tested by one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent mean\nseparation by Tukey\u2019s test with a 0.05 significance\nlevel (Sokal &amp; Rohlf, 1981). The value relative to\n\nJanuary 2000 (not sampled) was estimated by the\nmean between anterior and posterior months. The\nanalyses were performed with the Minitab statistical\nsoftware (1996). Due to constant occurrence of some\nvariables (biotic and abiotic) only in middle course\nalong the study period, associations among these\nvariables and sampling months were assessed by\ncluster analysis using Jaccard\u2019s similarity coefficient\nand unweighted group average method (UPGMA)\nfrom the Fitopac 1 software (Shepherd, 1995).\n\nRESULTS\n\nStream characterization\nSeasonal fluctuations in temperature,\n\nconductivity, pH, turbidity, alkalinity and rainfall\nin three stream segments are given in Fig. 2.\nTemperature ranged from 15\u00baC in headwaters\n(winter) to 27\u00baC in mouth (summer). The lowest\ntemperatures were recorded from July to August,\nwhile the highest values were observed from\nDecember to March. Conductivity was higher in\nFebruary (rainy season) and lower in April (early\ndry season). pH showed a narrow variation around\nneutral in middle course and in mouth and lightly\nacid in headwaters. Turbidity demonstrated a\nremarkable seasonality with lower values during the\ndry period and higher in the rainy period. Alkalinity\nrevealed maximum values in February and minimum\nfrom August to December and from April to July.\nRainfall data presented high concentration (913.8\nmm) from December to March (rainy season) and\nlow (60.9 mm) from April to July (dry season).\n\nThe lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations\nwere observed from August to March in head-\nwaters, while the highest were found from October\nto February in middle course. ANOVA indicated\nsignificant differences (p &lt;0.001) for oxygen\namong the three stream segments in all sampling\nmonths, except for September. Tukey\u2019s test\nrevealed significant differences (p &lt;0.05) between\nheadwaters and middle course throughout the\nstudy period, except for September and March.\nBetween headwaters and mouth, there were no\nsignificant differences in September, December,\nMay and July, while between middle course and\nmouth, the differences were not significant only\nin September and June (Table 1).\n\n\n\nBraz.

Substrate composition\nin middle course and mouth during both seasons\nwas predominantly sandy, followed by silt and clay,\nwhile in headwaters a considerable change in com-\nposition from dry to rainy season was verified\n(Table 3).\n\nMarginal vegetation in headwaters and middle\ncourse showed open areas dominated by herbaceous\nplants as Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Zingiberaceae,\nScrophulariaceae, Asteraceae, Polygonaceae,\nLamiaceae, Begoniaceae, Leguminosae, Lithraceae\nand Commelinaceae, while near to mouth, shrubby-\narboreous shaded by riparian canopy were noted\nas Melastomataceae, Boraginaceae, Hydrophyllaceae,\nLeguminosae and Myrtaceae. Aquatic vegetation\n\nin headwaters and middle course included filamen-\ntous green algae (Spyrogira sp. 1, Spyrogira sp. 2,\nOedogonium sp., Microspora floccosa) and blue\nalgae (Phormidium cf. retzii), macrophytes as\nPontederiaceae (Heteranthera reniformis) and\nOnagraceae (Ludwigia aff. suffruticosa, L. caparosa,\nL. octovalvis, L. elegans). Adjacent vegetation\nthroughout the entire stream was represented mainly\nby Poaceae.\n\nBesides fishes, tadpoles of Hyla albopunctata\nand macroinvertebrates as Mollusca (Planorbidae),\nCrustacea (Macrobrachium sp.), Arachnida\n(Araneae) and 8 orders of Insecta including Odonata\n(larvae), Coleoptera (adult), Heteroptera (adult),\nDiptera (larvae), Trichoptera (larvae), Hymenoptera\n(adult), Lepidoptera (adult), and Phasmodea (adult)\nwere also registered.\n\nFig. 2 \u2014 Variation of temperature, conductivity, pH, turbidity, alkalinity and rainfall in the study site from August 1999 to July\n2000 (pp = headwaters; \u00a2\u00a2  = middle course; ?? = mouth; ---------- =  rainy season).\n\n\n\nBraz.

Group\n3 presents three variables (tadpoles of H.\nalbopunctata, A. fuscoguttatus and low depth) (71%)\nregistered in five months (September, April to July).\nGroup 4 comprehends four variables represented\nby Clorophyceae, H. albopunctata, A. fuscoguttatus\nand low depth (58%) found in only four common\nmonths (April to July).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDuring the study period, the stream occupied\nby A. fuscoguttatus showed a remarkable seasonality,\nwith the highest values of water temperature,\n\nconductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, width, depth and\ncurrent velocity obtained in the rainy season.\nSubstrate composition presented a notable alteration\nin headwaters probably due to stream dumping\nprovoked by the high amount of rain in February\n(190.9 mm). The influence of these factors in water\nquality associated with the changes in aquatic and\nmarginal vegetation and fauna accentuates the\nimportance of the microhabitats formed among the\naquatic macrophytes after the rainfall. Considering\nthe representatives of fauna hereby recorded, such\nmicrohabitats may be contributing as refuge, source\nof food, protection against predators and site of\nreproduction for aquatic organisms.\n\nThe highest percentage of fishes sampled with\nsieves was similar to that of other works. Pavanelli\n&amp; Caramaschi (1997), studying the composition of\nthe ichthyofauna of two streams (also in the Paran\u00e1\nbasin), captured more specimens (85%) with sieves.\nUieda (1984) investigating the seasonal, spatial and\ntemporal distribution of fish fauna in a stream in the\nsame basin also had more success with the use of sieves.\n\nFig. 3 \u2014 Cluster diagram of the biotic and abiotic factors in the middle course of a stream tributary of Cedro Stream determined\nfrom August/1999 to July/2000, showing four groups.

The Neotropical ichthyofauna presents\nthe most diversified and richest freshwater\nichthyofauna of the world (B\u00f6hlke et al., 1978).\nHowever, most studies focus mainly large rivers and\nmore commercially important species, while the\nsmall size fishes (mostly less than 12 cm in standard\nlength), usually inhabiting streams and shallow\nwaters at the side of rivers, are restricted to few\ninvestigations (Lowe-McConnell, 1999).\n\nGarutti (1988) studying the ichthyofauna of\nBarra Funda Stream, Preto River basin (approximately\n14 km of length), recorded the same species found\nin the present investigation, including A. fuscoguttatus,\nfound in this study in all sampling months and in the\nthree stream segments. Garutti (op. cit.) also verified\nthat the main characteristic in the longitudinal\nsuccession was the addition of species, progressing\nfrom the headwaters toward the mouth. Besides size\ndifferences, addition of species was also evidenced\nin this work, with 2 species occurring in headwaters\n(A. fuscoguttatus and G. carapo), 5 in middle course\n(A. fuscoguttatus, G. carapo, H. ancistroides, P.\nreticulata, S. marmoratus), and 6 in mouth (A.\nfuscoguttatus, G. carapo, H. ancistroides, P. reticulata,\nO. pintoi, A. altiparanae).\n\nCluster analysis showed an ecological group\nof A. fuscoguttatus immatures and low depth in the\nmiddle course indicating a probable function of this\nabiotic parameter in that stage of ontogenetic deve-\nlopment. The association between the macrophyte\nHeteranthera reniformis (Pontederiaceae) and the\nmollusc Planorbidae also showed constancy along\nthe study period. According to Correa-Soares (1985),\nH. reniformis constitutes source of food for\nBiomphalaria tenagophila (Planorbidae) during all\nmonths of the year.\n\nThe fish species composition encountered in\nthe tributary stream of Cedro Stream indicates that\nin this stream some species are successful as A.\nfuscoguttatus, which demonstrated a plasticity in\nterms of microhabitat, pH and dissolved oxygen.\nIn headwaters, specimens were captured in pools\nor among macrophytes roots (Brachiaria sp.)\nthroughout sampling months; in middle course,\n\nimmatures were collected in low depth and in the\nmacrophyte Heteranthera reniformis, while adults\nwere found in deep and shallow stretches, and in\nmouth, the catfishes were sampled in pools or riffles.\nSuch plasticity can be reinforced by a preliminary\nsampling performed in February 1999, when it was\nobserved an air breathing behavior for this species\nin headwaters with a dissolved oxygen concentration\nof 1.0 mg L\u20131. Some representatives of the subfamily\nCallichthyinae exhibit air breathing as Hoplosternum\nthoracatum (Gee &amp; Graham, 1978), H. littorale and\nCallichthys callichthys (Carter &amp; Beadle, 1931),\nand Megalechis personata (Mol et al., 1999). In\nCorydoradinae there are evidences only for Brochis\nsplendens (Gee &amp; Graham, 1978) and Corydoras\naeneus (Kramer &amp; McClure, 1980). Therefore, based\non indicators above mentioned, there is a hypothesis\nthat must be tested aiming to know if A. fuscoguttatus\nis the first recorded species of the genus with air\nbreathing as an adaptation to hypoxic waters.\n\nPronounced differences among dissolved\noxygen concentrations along the study period were\nfound. The lowest oxygen levels were obtained in\nheadwaters as verified by Necchi (1992) also in the\nregion of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto. Besides the\ncharacteristics inherent to each stream segment, the\nvariation in the amount of oxygen in the three\nsampling sites suggests adaptative strategies that\nenable A. fuscoguttatus to inhabit the whole stream\nwith its distinct microhabitats. Thus, considering\nthat some Aspidoras species are very appreciated\nin aquaria as A. fuscoguttatus (pers. obs.), A.\npauciradiatus and A. menezesi (Pinkerton, 1987),\nA. raimundi (Schindler &amp; Staeck, 1996), ecological\ndata obtained in natural environment, as did in this\nstudy, can contribute to the production of these\nornamental fishes in artificial conditions, reducing\nthe irregular and predatory extraction made in the\nBrazilian hydrographic basins.\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 This research was supported by a CAPES\npersonal grant to the first author.
