Gratid\u00e3o eterna.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n VII \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe current socio-economic developments and lifestyle trends indicate an increasing \n\nconsumption of technological products and processes, powered by emergent concepts, such as \n\nInternet of Things (IoT) and smart environments, where everything is connected in a single \n\nnetwork. For this reason, wearable technology has been addressed to make the person, mainly \n\nthrough his clothes, able to communicate with and be part of this technological network. \n\nWireless communication systems are made up of several electronic components, which over \n\nthe years have been miniaturized and made more flexible, such as batteries, sensors, actuators, \n\ndata processing units, interconnectors and antennas. Turning these systems into wearable \n\nsystems is a demanding research subject. Specifically, the development of wearable antennas \n\nhas been challenging, because they are conventionally built on rigid substrates, hindering their \n\nintegration into the garment. That is why, considering the flexibility and the dielectric \n\nproperties of textile materials, making antennas in textile materials will allow expanding the \n\ninteraction of the user with some electronic devices, by interacting through the clothes. The \n\nelectronic devices may thus become less invasive and more discrete.  \n\nTextile antennas combine the traditional textile materials with new technologies. They emerge \n\nas a potential interface of the human-technology-environment relationship. They are becoming \n\nan active part in the wireless communication systems, aiming applications such as tracking and \n\nnavigation, mobile computing, health monitoring and others. Moreover, wearable antennas \n\nhave to be thin, lightweight, of easy maintenance, robust, and of low cost for mass production \n\nand commercialization.  \n\nIn this way, planar antennas, the microstrip patch type, have been proposed for garment \n\napplications, because this type of antenna presents all these characteristics, and are also \n\nadaptable to any surface. Such antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive (patch \n\nand ground plane) and dielectric (substrate) layers. Furthermore, the microstrip patch \n\nantennas, radiate perpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, \n\nensuring that the human body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. \n\nTo develop this type of antenna, the knowledge of the properties of textile materials is crucial \n\nas well as the knowledge of the manufacturing techniques for connecting the layers with glue, \n\nseam, adhesive sheets and others. Several properties of the materials influence the behaviour \n\nof the antenna. For instance, the bandwidth and the efficiency of a planar antenna are mainly \n\ndetermined by the permittivity and the thickness of the substrate. The use of textiles in \n\nwearable antennas requires thus the characterization of their properties. Specific electrical \n\nconductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used. Ordinary \n\ntextile fabrics have been used as substrates. \n\n\n\n VIII \n\nIn general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant, ?r, that reduces the surface wave \n\nlosses and increases the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. However, textile materials are \n\nconstantly exchanging water molecules with the surroundings, which affects their \n\nelectromagnetic properties. In addition, textile fabrics are porous, anisotropic and \n\ncompressible materials whose thickness and density might change with low pressures. \n\nTherefore, it is important to know how these characteristics influence the behaviour of the \n\nantenna in order to minimize unwanted effects.  \n\nTo explain some influences of the textile material on the performance of the wearable \n\nantennas, this PhD Thesis starts presenting a survey of the key points for the design and \n\ndevelopment of textile antennas, from the choice of the textile materials to the framing of the \n\nantenna. An analysis of the textile materials that have been used is also presented. Further, \n\nmanufacturing techniques of the textile antennas are described.?\t\n\nThe accurate characterization of textile materials to use as a dielectric substrate in wearable \n\nsystems is fundamental. However, little information can be found on the electromagnetic \n\nproperties of the regular textiles. Woven, knits and nonwovens are inhomogeneous, highly \n\nporous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental hygrometric conditions, \n\nmaking their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there are no standard \n\nmethods, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric characterization of \n\ntextiles. This PhD Thesis focuses on the dielectric characterization of the textile materials, \n\nsurveying the resonant and non-resonant methods that have been proposed to characterize the \n\ntextile and leather materials. Also, this PhD Thesis summarizes the characterization of textile \n\nmaterials made through these methods, which were validated by testing antennas that \n\nperformed well.  \t\n\nFurther a Resonant-Based Experimental Technique is presented. This new method is based on \n\nthe theory of resonance-perturbation, extracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based \n\non the shifts caused by the introduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. \n\nThe results obtained using this method have shown that when positioning the roughest face of \n\nthe material under test (MUT) in contact with the resonator board, the extracted dielectric \n\nconstant value is lower than the one extracted with this face positioned upside-down. Based \n\non this observation, superficial properties of textiles were investigated and their influence on \n\nthe performance of antennas was analysed.  \n\nThus, this PhD Thesis relates the results of the dielectric characterization to some structural \n\nparameters of textiles, such as surface roughness, superficial and bulk porosities. The results \n\nshow that both roughness and superficial porosity of the samples influence the measurements, \n\nthrough the positioning of the probes. Further, the influence of the positioning of the dielectric \n\nmaterial on the performance of textile microstrip antennas was analysed. For this, twelve \n\nprototypes of microstrip patch antennas were developed and tested. The results show that, \n\ndespite the differences obtained on the characterization when placing the face or reverse-sides \n\n\n\n IX \n\nof the MUT in contact with the resonator board, the obtained average result of ?r is well suited \n\nto design antennas ensuring a good performance. \n\nAccording to the European Commission Report in 2009, \u201cInternet of Things \u2014 An action plan for \n\nEurope\u201d, in the next years, the IoT will be able to improve the quality of life, especially in the \n\nhealth monitoring field. In the Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) context, the integration \n\nof textile antennas for energy harvesting into smart clothing is a particularly interesting \n\nsolution for a continuous wirelessly feed of the devices. Indeed, in the context of wearable \n\ndevices the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice. A specific goal of this PhD Thesis \n\nis thus to describe the concept of the energy harvesting and then presents a survey of textile \n\nantennas for RF energy harvesting. Further, a dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for \n\nelectromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, is also proposed. \n\nThe antenna aims to harvest energy to feed sensor nodes of a wearable health monitoring \n\nsystem. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with a radiation \n\nefficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest frequency bands, respectively. \n\nTo understand and improve the performance of the proposed printed monopole textile antenna, \n\nseveral manufacturing techniques are tested through preliminary tests, to identify promising \n\ntechniques and to discard inefficient ones, such as the gluing technique. Then, the influence \n\nof several parameters of the manufacturing techniques on the performance of the antenna are \n\nanalysed, such as the use of steam during lamination, the type of adhesive sheet, the \n\norientation of the conductive elements and others. For this, seven prototypes of the printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques.  \n\nThe measurement of the electrical surface resistance, Rs, has shown that the presence of the \n\nadhesive sheet used on the laminating process may reduce the conductivity of the conductive \n\nmaterials. Despite that, when measuring the return loss of printed monopole antennas \n\nproduced by lamination, the results show the antennas have a good performance. The results \n\nalso show that the orientation of the conductive fabric does not influence the performance of \n\nthe antennas. However, when testing embroidered antennas, the results show that the \n\ndirection and number of the stitches in the embroidery may influence the performance of the \n\nantenna and should thus be considered during manufacturing.  \n\nThe textile antennas perform well and their results support and give rise to the new concept \n\nof a continuous substrate to improve the integration of textile antennas into clothing, in a more \n\ncomfortable and pleasure way. A demonstrating prototype, the E-Caption: Smart and \n\nSustainable Coat, is thus presented. In this prototype of smart coat, the printed antenna is fully \n\nintegrated, as its dielectric is the textile material composing the coat itself. The E-Caption \n\nillustrates the innovative concept of textile antennas that can be manipulated as simple \n\nemblems. The results obtained testing the antenna before and after its integration into cloth, \n\nshow that the integration does not affect the behaviour of the antenna. Even on the presence \n\nof the human body the antenna is able to cover the proposed resonance frequencies (GSM 900 \n\nand DCS 1800 bands) with the radiation pattern still being omnidirectional.  \n\n\n\n X \n\nAt last, the exponential growth in the wearable market boost the industrialization process of \n\nmanufacturing textile antennas. As this research shows, the patch of the antennas can be easily \n\nand efficiently cut, embroidered or screen printed by industrial machines. However, the \n\nconception of a good industrial substrate that meets all the mechanical and electromagnetic \n\nrequirements of textile antennas is still a challenge. Following the continuous substrate \n\nconcept presented and demonstrated through the E-Caption, a new concept is proposed: the \n\ncontinuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material \n\nthat integrates the dielectric substrate and the conductive ground plane in a single material, \n\neliminating one laminating process. Three SIGP, that are weft knitted spacer fabrics having one \n\nconductive face, were developed in partnership with the Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, \n\ncreating synergy between research in the academy and industry. The results of testing the \n\nperformance of the SIGP materials show that the integration of the ground plane on the \n\nsubstrate changes the dielectric constant of the material, as a consequence of varying the \n\nthickness. Despite this, after the accurate dielectric and electrical characterization, the SIGP \n\nI material has shown a good performance as dielectric substrate of a microstrip patch antenna \n\nfor RF energy harvesting. This result is very promising for boosting the industrial fabrication of \n\nmicrostrip patch textile antennas and their mass production and dissemination into the IoT \n\nnetwork, guiding future developments of smart clothing and wearables. \n\nKeywords \n\nTextile antenna, electromagnetic properties, electromagnetic characterization, energy \n\nharvesting, smart clothing and wearable systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n XI \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nOs atuais desenvolvimentos socioecon\u00f3micos e tend\u00eancias de estilo de vida apontam para um \n\ncrescimento do consumo de produtos e processos tecnol\u00f3gicos, impulsionado por conceitos \n\nemergentes como a Internet das Coisas, onde tudo tudo est\u00e1 conectado em uma \u00fanica rede. \n\nPor esta raz\u00e3o, as tecnologias us\u00e1veis (wearable) est\u00e3o a afirmar-se propondo solu\u00e7\u00f5es que \n\ntornam o utilizador possivelmente atrav\u00e9s das suas roupas, capaz de comunicar com e fazer \n\nparte desta rede.  \n\nOs sistemas de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es sem fios s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddos por diversos componentes eletr\u00f3nicos, \n\nque com o passar dos anos foram sendo miniaturizados e fabricados em materiais flex\u00edveis, tais \n\ncomo as baterias, os sensores, as unidades de processamento de dados, as interconex\u00f5es e as \n\nantenas. Tornar os sistemas de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es sem fios em sistemas us\u00e1veis requer trabalho de \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o exigente. Nomeadamente, o desenvolvimento de antenas us\u00e1veis tem sido um \n\ndesafio, devido \u00e0s antenas serem tradicionalmente desenvolvidas em substratos r\u00edgidos, que \n\ndificultam a sua integra\u00e7\u00e3o no vestu\u00e1rio. Dessa forma, considerando a flexibilidade e as \n\npropriedades diel\u00e9tricas dos materiais t\u00eaxteis, as antenas t\u00eaxteis trazem a promessa de \n\npermitir a interac\u00e7\u00e3o dos utilizadores com os dispositivos eletr\u00f3nicos atrav\u00e9s da roupa, \n\ntornando os dispositivos menos invasivos e mais discretos.  \n\nAs antenas t\u00eaxteis combinam os materiais t\u00eaxteis tradicionais com novas tecnologias e emergem \n\nassim como uma potencial interface de fronteira entre seres humanos-tecnologias-ambientes. \n\nExpandindo assim a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre o utilizador e os dispositivos eletr\u00f3nicos ao recurso do \n\nvestu\u00e1rio. Assim, atrav\u00e9s das antenas t\u00eaxteis, o vestu\u00e1rio torna-se uma parte ativa nos sistemas \n\nde comunica\u00e7\u00e3o sem fios, visando aplica\u00e7\u00f5es como rastreamento e navega\u00e7\u00e3o, computa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nm\u00f3vel, monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de sa\u00fade, entre outros. Para isto, as antenas para vestir devem ser finas, \n\nleves, de f\u00e1cil manuten\u00e7\u00e3o, robustas e de baixo custo para produ\u00e7\u00e3o em massa e \n\ncomercializa\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nDesta forma, as antenas planares do tipo patch microstrip t\u00eam sido propostas para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nem vestu\u00e1rio, pois apresentam todas estas caracter\u00edsticas e tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o adapt\u00e1veis a qualquer \n\nsuperf\u00edcie. Estas antenas s\u00e3o geralmente formadas pela sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de camadas condutoras \n\n(elemento radiante e plano de massa) e diel\u00e9tricas (substrato). Al\u00e9m disso, as antenas patch \n\nmicrostrip irradiam perpendicularmente ao plano de massa, que bloqueia a radia\u00e7\u00e3o da antena, \n\ngarantindo que o corpo humano \u00e9 exposto apenas a uma fra\u00e7\u00e3o muito pequena da radia\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPara desenvolver este tipo de antena, \u00e9 crucial conhecer as propriedades dos materiais t\u00eaxteis, \n\nbem como as t\u00e9cnicas de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o para conectar as camadas, com cola, costuras, folhas \n\nadesivas, entre outros. Diversas propriedades dos materiais influenciam o comportamento da \n\nantena. Por exemplo, a permitividade e a espessura do substrato determinam a largura de \n\n\n\n XII \n\nbanda e a efici\u00eancia de uma antena planar. O uso de t\u00eaxteis em antenas us\u00e1veis requer assim \n\numa caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o precisa das suas propriedades. Os t\u00eaxteis condutores el\u00e9tricos s\u00e3o materiais \n\nespec\u00edficos que est\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis comercialmente em diversas formas e t\u00eam sido utilizados com \n\nsucesso para fabricar o elemento radiante e o plano de massa das antenas. Para fabricar o \n\nsubstrato diel\u00e9trico t\u00eam sido utilizados materiais t\u00eaxteis convencionais. \n\nGeralmente, os materiais t\u00eaxteis apresentam uma constante diel\u00e9trica (?r) muito baixa, o que \n\nreduz as perdas de ondas superficiais e aumenta a largura de banda da antena. No entanto, os \n\nmateriais t\u00eaxteis est\u00e3o constantemente a trocar mol\u00e9culas de \u00e1gua com o ambiente em que \n\nest\u00e3o inseridos, o que afeta as suas propriedades eletromagn\u00e9ticas. Al\u00e9m disso, os tecidos e os \n\noutros materiais t\u00eaxteis planares s\u00e3o materiais porosos, anisotr\u00f3picos e compress\u00edveis, cuja \n\nespessura e densidade variam sob muito baixas press\u00f5es. Portanto, \u00e9 importante saber como \n\nestas grandezas e caracter\u00edsticas estruturais influenciam o comportamento da antena, de forma \n\na minimizar os efeitos indesej\u00e1veis. \n\nPara explicar algumas das influ\u00eancias do material t\u00eaxtil no desempenho das antenas us\u00e1veis, \n\nesta Tese de Doutoramento come\u00e7a por fazer o estado da arte sobre os pontos-chave para o \n\ndesenvolvimento de antenas t\u00eaxteis, desde a escolha dos materiais t\u00eaxteis at\u00e9 ao processo de \n\nfabrico da antena. Al\u00e9m disso, a tese identifica e apresenta uma an\u00e1lise dos materiais t\u00eaxteis \n\ne t\u00e9cnicas de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o que t\u00eam sido utilizados e referidos na literatura. \n\nA caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o rigorosa dos materiais t\u00eaxteis para usar como substrato diel\u00e9trico em sistemas \n\nus\u00e1veis \u00e9 fundamental. No entanto, pouca informa\u00e7\u00e3o existe sobre a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\npropriedades eletromagn\u00e9ticas dos t\u00eaxteis vulgares. Como j\u00e1 referido, os tecidos, malhas e \n\nn\u00e3o-tecidos s\u00e3o materiais heterog\u00e9neos, altamente porosos, compress\u00edveis e facilmente \n\ninfluenciados pelas condi\u00e7\u00f5es higrom\u00e9tricas ambientais, dificultando a sua caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\neletromagn\u00e9tica. N\u00e3o havendo nenhum m\u00e9todo padr\u00e3o, v\u00e1rios autores t\u00eam vindo a adaptar \n\nalgumas t\u00e9cnicas para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o diel\u00e9trica dos materiais t\u00eaxteis. Esta Tese de \n\nDoutoramento foca a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o diel\u00e9trica dos materiais t\u00eaxteis, revendo os m\u00e9todos \n\nressonantes e n\u00e3o ressonantes que foram propostos para caracterizar os materiais t\u00eaxteis e o \n\ncouro. Al\u00e9m disso, esta Tese de Doutoramento resume a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de diel\u00e9ctricos t\u00eaxteis \n\nfeita atrav\u00e9s dos m\u00e9todos revistos e que foi validada testando antenas que apresentaram um \n\nbom desempenho. \n\nNo seguimento da revis\u00e3o, apresenta-se uma T\u00e9cnica Experimental Baseada em Resson\u00e2ncia. \n\nEsta nova t\u00e9cnica baseia-se na teoria da perturba\u00e7\u00e3o de resson\u00e2ncia, sendo a permitividade e \n\ntangente de perda extra\u00eddas com base nas mudan\u00e7as de frequ\u00eancia causadas pela introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde um superstrato no elemento radiante de uma antena patch microstrip. Os resultados de \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o obtidos atrav\u00e9s deste m\u00e9todo revelam que, ao posicionar a face mais rugosa do \n\nmaterial em teste em contato com a placa de resson\u00e2ncia, o valor da constante diel\u00e9trica \n\nextra\u00edda \u00e9 inferior ao valor extra\u00eddo quando esta face \u00e9 colocada ao contr\u00e1rio. Com base nesta \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00e3o, as propriedades estruturais da superf\u00edcie dos materiais t\u00eaxteis foram investigadas \n\ne a sua influ\u00eancia no desempenho das antenas foi analisada. \n\n\n\n XIII \n\nAssim, esta Tese de Doutoramento relaciona os resultados da caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o diel\u00e9trica com \n\nalguns par\u00e2metros estruturais dos materiais, como rugosidade da superf\u00edcie, porosidades \n\nsuperficial e total. Os resultados mostram que tanto a rugosidade como a porosidade superficial \n\ndas amostras influenciam os resultados, que dependem assim do posicionamento do material \n\nque est\u00e1 a ser testado. Tamb\u00e9m foi analisada a influ\u00eancia do posicionamento do material \n\ndiel\u00e9trico na performance das antenas t\u00eaxteis tipo patch microstrip. Para isso, foram \n\ndesenvolvidos e testados doze prot\u00f3tipos de antenas patch microstrip. Os resultados mostram \n\nque, apesar das diferen\u00e7as observadas durante o processo de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, o valor m\u00e9dio da \n\npermitividade \u00e9 adequado para a modela\u00e7\u00e3o das antenas, garantindo um bom desempenho. \n\nDe acordo com o relat\u00f3rio da Comiss\u00e3o Europeia, \u201cInternet das Coisas - Um plano de a\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\na Europa\u201d, emitido em 2009, nos pr\u00f3ximos anos a Internet das Coisas poder\u00e1 melhorar a \n\nqualidade de vida das pessoas, nomeadamente pela monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da sa\u00fade. No contexto das \n\nRedes de Sensores Sem Fios do Corpo Humano, a integra\u00e7\u00e3o de antenas t\u00eaxteis para recolha de \n\nenergia em roupas inteligentes \u00e9 uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o particularmente interessante, pois permite uma \n\nalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o sem fios e cont\u00ednua dos dispositivos. De fato, nos dispositivos us\u00e1veis a substitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde baterias n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil de praticar. Um dos objetivos espec\u00edficos desta Tese de Doutoramento \n\n\u00e9, portanto, descrever o conceito de recolha de energia e apresentar o estado da arte sobre \n\nantenas t\u00eaxteis para recolha de energia proveniente da R\u00e1dio Frequ\u00eancia (RF). Nesta tese, \u00e9 \n\ntamb\u00e9m proposta uma antena impressa do tipo monopolo de dupla banda, fabricada em \n\nsubstrato t\u00eaxtil, para recolha de energia eletromagn\u00e9tica, operando nas bandas GSM 900 e DCS \n\n1800. A antena visa recolher energia para alimentar os n\u00f3s de sensores de um sistema us\u00e1vel \n\npara monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da sa\u00fade. Os ganhos da antena apresentada foram cerca de 1.8 dBi e 2.06 \n\ndBi, aliados a uma efici\u00eancia de radia\u00e7\u00e3o de 82% e 77.6% para as faixas de frequ\u00eancia mais \n\nbaixa e alta, respetivamente. \n\nPara entender e melhorar o desempenho da antena impressa tipo monopolo de dupla banda em \n\nsubstrato t\u00eaxtil, v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas de fabrico foram testadas atrav\u00e9s de testes preliminares, de \n\nforma a identificar as t\u00e9cnicas promissoras e a descartar as ineficientes, como \u00e9 o caso da \n\nt\u00e9cnica de colagem. De seguida, analisou-se a influ\u00eancia de v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros das t\u00e9cnicas de \n\nfabrico sobre o desempenho da antena, como o uso de vapor durante a lamina\u00e7\u00e3o, o tipo de \n\nfolha adesiva, a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos irradiantes e outros. Para isto, sete prot\u00f3tipos da \n\nantena t\u00eaxtil monopolar impressa foram fabricados por t\u00e9cnicas de lamina\u00e7\u00e3o e bordado. \n\nAs medi\u00e7\u00f5es da resist\u00eancia el\u00e9trica superficial, Rs, mostrou que a presen\u00e7a da folha adesiva \n\nusada no processo de laminagem pode reduzir a condutividade dos materiais condutores. Apesar \n\ndisso, ao medir o S11 das antenas impressas tipo monopolo produzidas por laminagem, os \n\nresultados mostram que as antenas t\u00eam uma boa adapta\u00e7\u00e3o da imped\u00e2ncia. Os resultados \n\ntamb\u00e9m mostram que a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido condutor, neste caso um tafet\u00e1, n\u00e3o influencia o \n\ndesempenho das antenas. No entanto, ao testar antenas bordadas, os resultados mostram que \n\na dire\u00e7\u00e3o e o n\u00famero de pontos no bordado podem influenciar o desempenho da antena e, \n\nportanto, estas s\u00e3o caracter\u00edsticas que devem ser consideradas durante a fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\n\n XIV \n\nDe um modo geral, as antenas t\u00eaxteis funcionam bem e seus resultados suportam e d\u00e3o origem \n\nao um novo conceito de substrato cont\u00ednuo para melhorar a integra\u00e7\u00e3o de antenas t\u00eaxteis no \n\nvestu\u00e1rio, de maneira mais confort\u00e1vel e elegante. A tese apresenta um prot\u00f3tipo \n\ndemonstrador deste conceito, o E-Caption: A Smart and Sustainable Coat. Neste prot\u00f3tipo de \n\ncasaco inteligente, a antena impressa est\u00e1 totalmente integrada, pois o seu substrato diel\u00e9trico \n\n\u00e9 o pr\u00f3prio material t\u00eaxtil no qual \u00e9 feito o casaco. O E-Caption ilustra um conceito inovador \n\nde antenas t\u00eaxteis que podem ser manipuladas como simples emblemas. Os resultados obtidos \n\ntestando a antena antes e depois da integra\u00e7\u00e3o no casaco mostram que a integra\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o afeta \n\no comportamento da antena. Mesmo na presen\u00e7a do corpo humano, a antena t\u00eaxtil \u00e9 capaz de \n\ncobrir as frequ\u00eancias de resson\u00e2ncia propostas (bandas GSM 900 e DCS 1800), e de assegurar \n\num padr\u00e3o de radia\u00e7\u00e3o omnidirecional. \n\nPor fim, o crescimento exponencial do mercado de dispositivos us\u00e1veis impulsiona o processo \n\nde industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o do fabrico de antenas t\u00eaxteis. Como mostrado ao longo desta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nos elementos radiantes das antenas podem ser cortados, bordados ou serigrafados por m\u00e1quinas \n\nindustriais de forma f\u00e1cil e eficiente. No entanto, a conce\u00e7\u00e3o de um bom substrato industrial, \n\nque satisfa\u00e7a todos os requisitos mec\u00e2nicos e eletromagn\u00e9ticos das antenas t\u00eaxteis, ainda \u00e9 um \n\ndesafio. Seguindo o conceito do substrato cont\u00ednuo apresentado e demonstrado atrav\u00e9s do E-\n\nCaption, prop\u00f5e-se um novo conceito: o desenvolvimento de um Substrato cont\u00ednuo Integrando \n\no Plano de Massa (SIGP). O SIGP \u00e9 um material t\u00eaxtil inovador que integra o substrato diel\u00e9trico \n\ne o plano de massa em um \u00fanico material, eliminando assim uma das fases do processo de \n\nlaminagem. \n\nTr\u00eas SIGP, que s\u00e3o malhas 3D com uma face condutora, foram desenvolvidos em parceria com \n\na Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, criando assim uma sinergia entre academia e ind\u00fastria. Os \n\nresultados dos testes de desempenho dos SIGP mostram que a integra\u00e7\u00e3o do plano de massa no \n\nsubstrato diel\u00e9trico altera a constante diel\u00e9trica do material, devido \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o da espessura \n\nocasionada pela integra\u00e7\u00e3o do plano de massa. Apesar disso, ap\u00f3s a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\neletromagn\u00e9tica do material, o material SIGP I mostrou um bom desempenho quando aplicado \n\ncomo substrato diel\u00e9trico de uma antena tipo patch microstrip para recolha de energia \n\neletromagn\u00e9tica. Este resultado \u00e9 muito promissor para impulsionar a fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o industrial de \n\nantenas t\u00eaxteis do tipo patch microstrip, e a sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o em massa e dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o na rede \n\nda Internet das Coisas, orientando futuros desenvolvimentos de tecnologias us\u00e1veis e vestu\u00e1rio \n\ninteligente1. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave \n\nAntenas t\u00eaxteis, propriedades eletromagn\u00e9ticas, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o eletromagn\u00e9tica, recolha de \n\nenergia, vestu\u00e1rio inteligente e sistemas us\u00e1veis.  \n\n                                                   \n1 Resumo redigido ao abrigo do Novo Acordo Ortogr\u00e1fico da L\u00edngua Portuguesa. \n\n\n\n XV \n\nIndex \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments ..........................................................................................

According to Cisco, IoT describes a system where items in the physical world, and sensors \n\nwithin or attached to these items, are connected to the Internet via wireless and wired Internet \n\nconnections. These sensors can use various types of local area connections such as Radio \n\nFrequency Identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and \n\nZigbee. Sensors can also have wide area connectivity such as Global System for Mobile \n\nCommunication (GSM), Global Positioning System (GPS), 3G, and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2]. \n\nFollowing the European Commission Report [3], in the next years, the IoT will be able to \n\nimprove the quality of life, especially in the health monitoring field. The development of smart \n\nobjects for IoT applications, include the capacity of this objects to be identifiable, to \n\ncommunicate and to Interact [4]. In this context, wearable technology has been addressed to \n\nmake the person, mainly through his clothes, able to communicate with and be part of this \n\ntechnological network. Figure 1-1 illustrated the growing of the IoT in the last decades. \n\n \nFigure 1-1 Growing of IoT, based on Cisco data [5] \n\n\n\n 2 \n\nWireless communication systems are made up of several electronic components, which over \n\nthe years have been miniaturized and made more flexible, such as batteries, sensors, actuators, \n\ndata processing units, interconnectors and antennas [6]. In the systems for on-body \n\napplications, the antennas have been challenging, because they are conventionally built on \n\nrigid substrates, hindering their efficient and comfortable integration into the garment. \n\nHowever, embedding antennas into clothing allows expanding the interaction of the user with \n\nsome electronic devices, making them less invasive and more discrete. Since 2001, when P. \n\nSalonen et al. [7] proposed the first prototype of flexible antenna made of fabrics, the use of \n\ntextile materials to develop wearable antennas has increased exponentially.  \n\nThe integration of electronics into textiles has started a new era for the apparel industry. In a \n\nnear future, wearable antennas will be part of everyday clothing, transforming the garment in \n\nan interface for wireless communication actions. Thus, textile antennas that are designed \n\ncombining the traditional textile materials with new technologies emerge as a potential \n\ninterface of the human-technology-environment relationship, aiming applications such as \n\ntracking and navigation, mobile computing and others. ? \n\nTo achieve a low profile and unobtrusive integration of the antenna into the garment, antennas \n\nhave to be thin, lightweight, robust and easy to maintain.  Moreover, they must be low cost for \n\nmanufacturing and commercializing. In this way, planar antennas have been proposed for \n\nwearable applications, because this type of antenna topology combines all these \n\ncharacteristics, and is also adaptable to any surface. Such antennas are usually formed by \n\nassembling conductive (patch and ground plane) and dielectric (substrate) layers [8], as shown \n\non Figure 1-2.  Furthermore, planar antennas, such as the microstrip patch antenna, radiate \n\nperpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, ensuring that the \n\nhuman body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. \n\n \n\nFigure 1-2 Layout of microstrip patch antenna (a) Front view and (b) cross section \n\nTo develop planar textile antennas, the knowledge of the properties of textile materials is \n\ncrucial as well as insight into the manufacturing techniques for assembling the layers, such as \n\nlaminating with glue, seam and adhesive sheets. Fabrics are planar fibrous materials whose \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nproperties are mainly determined by the properties of the component fibres and the structure \n\nof the yarns and/or of the fabric. They are porous materials, in which the density of the fibres, \n\nair volume and size of the pores determine general behaviour, for instance, air permeability \n\nand thermal insulation. Moreover, as these features are somehow difficult to control in real \n\napplications of textiles, it would be very important to study how they influence the behaviour \n\nof the antenna in order to minimize any unwanted effects2.   \n\n1.1 Motivation \nBesides IoT being a hot current research topic challenging textile engineers to develop novel \n\nmaterials, processes and products for wearable electronics, according to the ATP - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nT\u00eaxtil e Vestu\u00e1rio de Portugal (in English, Textile and Garment Association of Portugal) the \n\ntechnical textiles applied to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), are pointed \n\nas one of the ten macro trends for the textile market until 2020 [9]. \n\nBased on the ATP study [9], the growing market of technical textiles for ICT means an \n\ninterdependence between research fields. The studies that combine intersections of science, \n\ntechnology, materials engineering, business and fashion, emerge in Europe and will lead the \n\nR&amp;D strategies, on the next decades, following the diagram presented on Figure 1-3.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1-3 Schematic of the interdependence between fields to the development of technical textile \nfor ICT, based on [9] \n\n                                                   \n2 In this PhD Thesis on Textile Engineering some fundamental parameters of antennas will be discussed, \nin order to relate the performance of the antennas with the applied textile materials and manufacturing \ntechniques. The fundamental parameters of antennas are described on Appendix A. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nThe integration of wearable technologies and wireless communications into textile materials \n\nand products still is in an emerging phase. The majority of the studies found in the state of the \n\nart of textile antennas, were made by electrical engineers, only a few works presented the \n\npoint of view of textile engineering. For this reason, the main motivation of this work is to \n\ncontribute for the expansion of the textile presence in IoT, through advancing on the \n\nintegration of wearable devices and systems for IoT into textiles, covering some gaps on the \n\nstate of the art, fully described in the following Chapters. Four main gaps have been lead to \n\nthis study: \n\n\u2022 Despite the growing study of textile antennas in the past decades, the electromagnetic \n\ncharacterization of dielectric textile materials, to use as dielectric substrate, is still a \n\nchallenge. Until now, none work has analysed the influence of the structural parameters of \n\ntextiles on their dielectric behaviour; \n\n\u2022 Also, so far, all textile antennas have been built stand-alone and are further glued into \n\nclothing to measure the performance when close to human body. No one has so far fully \n\nintegrated a textile antenna on clothing, consequently there are no studies about the \n\ninfluence of the human body on the integrated antenna; \n\n\u2022 Several manufacturing techniques of textile antennas are presented in the state of the art, \n\nbut no industrial solution was found; \n\n\u2022 At last, the integration of wearable devices raises the question about how to feed them. \n\nThe textile antennas for energy harvesting emerge as a particularly interesting solution \n\nwhen the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice, such as in embedded wearable \n\nsystems. Despite the growth in rigid antennas for energy harvesting and wireless power \n\ntransmission, only few works have been presented using textile antennas. \n\n1.2 Objectives \nThe general objective of this PhD Thesis is to characterize the dielectric properties of the \n\ntextile materials, in order to select and develop a group of industrial textile materials, well \n\nsuited to apply as dielectric substrates for textile antennas for energy harvesting. To achieve \n\nthis goal, six specific objectives were considered: \n\n1. Characterize the dielectric properties of textile materials, studying the influence of some \n\nstructural properties of textiles on their electromagnetic behaviour; \n\n2. Test several manufacturing processes to produce textile antennas, analysing the influence \n\nof the manufacturing technique on the performance of the antenna; \n\n3. Develop, produce and test a textile antenna for RF energy harvesting; \n\n4. Analyse the integration of antenna on clothing, and the influence of the human body on its \n\nperformance; \n\n5. Create a prototype of a smart garment, demonstrating the concept of energy harvesting \n\nthrough textile antennas on cloth; \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n6. At last, develop a new textile structure that reduces hand-made manufacturing effects, and \n\nimproves the integration of industrial textile antennas on cloth. \n\n1.3 Outline \nThis PhD Thesis is organized in nine Chapters. This first one presents the motivation to study \n\ntextile antennas and the objectives of this work. Chapter 2 describes the electromagnetic \n\nproperties of the textile materials used to manufacturing textile antennas. Also, presents a \n\nsurvey of the key points for the design and development of textile antennas, from the choice \n\nof the textile materials to the framing of the antenna. Still, manufacturing techniques of the \n\ntextile antennas are described.\t\t\n\nChapter 3 gives an overview about the resonant and non-resonant methods to characterize the \n\ndielectric properties of textile materials. Moreover, it presents and compares the obtained \n\nresults in the dielectric characterization to the performance of textile antennas. Chapter 4 \n\npresents the Resonator-Based Experimental Technique. This new method to characterize the \n\ndielectric properties of textiles is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation. It aims \n\nextracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based on the shifts caused by the \n\nintroduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. Also, this Chapter correlates \n\nthe results obtained on the dielectric characterization with some structural parameters of \n\ntextiles, such as surface roughness and superficial and bulk porosities. \n\nChapter 5 describes the concept of the energy harvesting and presents a survey of textile \n\nantennas for RF energy harvesting. A dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for \n\nelectromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands is also proposed \n\nin this Chapter. In order to improve the performance of this printed monopole textile antenna, \n\nChapter 6 then tests several manufacturing techniques by evaluating the S11 parameter of a \n\npatch microstrip textile antenna. Also, the electrical resistance sheet of two conductive fabrics \n\nwas characterized and analysed. Further, seven prototypes of the printed monopole textile \n\nantennas were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques and were tested.  \n\nChapter 7 presents the first prototype with a fully integrated textile antenna, named E-Caption: \n\nSmart and Sustainable Coat. It has an embedded dual-band printed monopole textile antenna \n\nfor RF energy harvesting. This printed antenna is fully integrated, as its dielectric is the textile \n\nmaterial composing the coat itself. The E-Caption illustrates the innovative concept of textile \n\nantennas that can be manipulated as simple emblems. Furthermore, this Chapter analyses the \n\nresults obtained, before and after the integration of the antenna into cloth.  \n\nFinally, Chapter 8 ends the experimental work presenting the first continuous Substrate \n\nIntegrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material that integrates the \n\ndielectric substrate and the conductive ground plane in a single textile fabric. The \n\nmanufacturing and electromagnetic characterization processes are described. Also, to validate \n\nthis new substrate, a microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting was developed and tested. \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nTo sum up, Chapter 9 gives a final remark, summarizing the main conclusions and presenting \n\nthe future works. \n\n1.4 Original Contributions \nDuring these years, part of this study has been presented and recognized by the scientific \n\ncommunity, through the following listed original contributions in international journals, \n\nconferences and books. \n\nArticles in Scientific International Journals  \n\n\u2022  C.

Several properties of the materials \n\ninfluence the behaviour of the antenna. For instance, the bandwidth and the efficiency of a \n\nplanar antenna are mainly determined by the permittivity and the thickness of the substrate. \n\nThe use of textiles in wearable antennas requires the characterization of their properties. \n\nSpecific electrical conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully \n\nused. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates. In general, textiles present a very \n\nlow dielectric constant that reduces the surface wave losses and increases the impedance \n\nbandwidth of the antenna. However, textile materials are constantly exchanging water \n\nmolecules with the surroundings, which affects their electromagnetic properties. In addition, \n\ntextile fabrics are porous, anisotropic and compressible materials whose thickness and density \n\nmight change with low pressures. Therefore, it is important to know how these characteristics \n\ninfluence the behaviour of the antenna in order to minimize unwanted effects. This Chapter \n\npresents a survey of the key points for the design and development of textile antennas, from \n\nthe choice of the textile materials to the framing of the antenna. An analysis of the textile \n\nmaterials that have been used is also presented. Further, manufacturing techniques of the \n\ntextile antennas are described.? \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nBody worn systems endowed with sensing, processing, actuation, communication and energy \n\nharvesting and storage abilities are emerging as a solution to the challenges of ubiquitous \n\nmonitoring of people in applications such as healthcare, lifestyle, protection and safety [10], \n\n[11]. Accordingly, the new generation of clothing will be able to sense, communicate data and \n\nharvest energy in a nonintrusive way. The wearable antenna is thus the bond that integrates \n\ncloth into the communication system, making electronic devices less obtrusive. To achieve good \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nresults, wearable antennas have to be thin, lightweight, low maintenance, robust, inexpensive \n\nand easily integrated in radio frequency (RF) circuits. Thus, planar antennas are the preferred \n\ntype of antenna as, despite the fact their maximum attainable bandwidth-efficiency is \n\nsignificantly lower than the theoretical limit for electrically small antennas, they allow an \n\nexcellent integration of the antenna with the RF circuits, feeding lines and matching circuits \n\non a standard multilayer board material [8]. Specific requirements for the design of wearable \n\nantennas are thus: planar structure; flexible conductive materials in the patch and ground \n\nplane; and flexible dielectric materials. The characteristics of the materials are crucial for the \n\nbehaviour of the antenna. For instance, the permittivity and the thickness of the dielectric \n\nsubstrate mainly determine the bandwidth and the efficiency performance of the planar \n\nantenna [8]. Also, the conductivity of the ground plane and of the patch is an important factor \n\nin the efficiency of the antenna and must be the highest possible.  \n\nTextile materials, being universally used and easily available, are possible materials to design \n\nwearable antennas. Therefore, specific conductive textiles, sometimes designated \n\nelectrotextiles, that are commercially available have been successfully used in antennas. \n\nOrdinary textile fabrics have been used as dielectric substrates. However, little information is \n\nfound on the electromagnetic properties of regular commercialized textiles.  \n\nFabrics are flexible and compressible materials which thickness and density might change with \n\nlow pressures. Moreover, the main orientation of the fibres and/or yarns introduces an intrinsic \n\nplanar anisotropy of general properties. Plus, fibres are constantly exchanging water molecules \n\nwith the surroundings, which affects their morphology and properties. All these features are \n\nsomehow difficult to control in real applications of textiles. This Chapter presents the state of \n\nart reviewing the characteristics of textiles that influences the performance of the antennas.  \n\n2.2 Electromagnetic Properties of Textiles \nAs explained on Chapter 1, planar antennas, such as microstrip patch type, have been proposed \n\nfor wearable applications. These antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive and \n\ndielectric layers, as previously presented on Figure 1-2. Their dimensions are directly related \n\nto the desired resonance frequency which are defined as portions of the wavelength of \n\npropagation [8]. The wavelength is dependent on the permittivity and permeability of the \n\npropagation medium (e.g. the dielectric substrate). For this reason, the knowledge of the \n\nelectromagnetic properties of the textile materials is crucial to design wearable antennas [12].  \n\nThe response of the material to the electromagnetic fields is described by the constitutive \n\nparameters of the material: permittivity (?), permeability (\u00b5) and conductivity (?). These \n\nparameters also determine the spatial extent to which the electromagnetic field can penetrate \n\nthe material at a given frequency. The relationship between these constitutive parameters and \n\nthe electromagnetic fields is described through the Maxwell\u2019s equations [13]. For the design of \n\nantennas, the permittivity is the key parameter to characterise the substrate material and the \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nconductivity characterises the conductive components. The next subsections will present the \n\ndefinition and physical significance of the main variables. The conductive and dielectric textile \n\nmaterials, that have been used to develop wearable antennas, will also be described and \n\ndiscussed. \n\n2.2.1  Dielectric Textiles \n\nIn the dielectric materials, the conductivity is very small or null (?&lt;&lt;1). Thus, their \n\nelectromagnetic behaviour is mainly determined by the permittivity and the permeability. \n\nPermittivity describes the interaction of the material with the electric field applied on it, \n\nwhereas permeability describes the interaction of the material with the magnetic field applied \n\non it.  \n\nPermittivity is a complex value that generally depends on frequency, temperature and moisture \n\n[13]\u2013[15]. Furthermore, permittivity is usually expressed as a relative value (?r), given by (2-1), \n\nwhere ?o is the permittivity of vacuum, equal to 8.854\u00d710)*+\tF/m. \n\n? = ?2?3 = ?2 ??3 ? ??\"3                                             (2-1) \n\nThe relative permittivity is often called dielectric constant. The real part of the relative \n\npermittivity (?\u2019r) is a measure of how much energy from an external electric field is stored in \n\nthe material. The imaginary part of the relative permittivity (?\u201dr), or loss factor, is a measure \n\nof how dissipative a material is to an external electric field.  \n\nThe ratio between the imaginary and the real part of the relative permittivity is the loss tangent \n\n(tan?) \u2013 often called the material dissipation factor (Df), expressed by (2-2). In the ideal \n\nscenario, the perfect dielectric material has tan? = 0.  \n\n????\t =&lt;\"=\n<>=\n\n                                                      (2-2) \n\nWhen designing antennas, the key parameter for the performance of the dielectric substrate is \n\nthe relative permittivity as well as the loss tangent.  \n\nAs textile materials are anisotropic materials, their characterization also depends on the \n\nelectric field\u2019s orientation. This anisotropy is fully described by a permittivity tensor, although \n\nin most practical applications like the ones herein surveyed, one specific component of this \n\ntensor is enough to characterize the behaviour of the textile material for a specific application.   \n\nBesides the dielectric behaviour of textile materials being dependent on frequency, \n\ntemperature and humidity [16]\u2013[19], it also depends on the properties of the component fibres \n\nand the structure of the yarns and/or of the fabrics, and on the fibre packing density in the \n\nfibrous material [16], [20]\u2013[22]. Also, textile materials incorporate some intrinsic singularities \n\ndifficulties due to their inhomogeneity and instability, being a challenge in terms of accurate \n\ncharacterization, as will be discussed on Chapters 3 and 4. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nIn general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant as they are very porous materials and \n\nthe presence of air approaches the relative permittivity to one. As reference, Table 2-1 shows \n\nthe dielectric constant of different materials. \n\nTable 2-1 Relative permittivity of different type of materials \n\nReference Material ?r \n[23] Alumina 10.1 \n[24] FR-4 4.50 \n\n[25] \nPaper 7 \nGlass 5 - 10 \n\n[26] \nQuartzel\u00ae Fabric 1.95 \n\n100% cotton fabric 1.60 \n\nFor the development of wearable antennas, several conventional textile fabrics have been \n\napplied as dielectric substrate, exhibiting very low ?r and tan?, which reduce the surface wave \n\nlosses and improve the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. Surface waves are connected to \n\nthe guided wave propagation within the substrate. Hence, by reducing the dielectric constant, \n\nthe contribution of the spatial waves increases, and consequently the impedance bandwidth of \n\nthe antenna increases, allowing the development of antennas with higher gain and acceptable \n\nefficiency [27]\u2013[30]. A sufficiently wideband and efficient planar textile antenna is realized by \n\nselecting a substrate with a low dielectric constant (preferably ? 4) and a low loss tangent  \n\n(<10-2) [31]. \n\n2.2.1.1  Influence of the Thickness of Dielectric Textiles \n\nThe thickness of the substrate is critical in the design of the antenna. As textile materials \n\npresent a quite narrow range of relative permittivity values, it is therefore their thickness, \n\nwhich values may present much larger variations, that will mainly determine the bandwidth as \n\nwell the input impedance of the antenna and so its resonance frequency [8], [32]. \n\nFor a fixed relative permittivity, the substrate thickness may be chosen to maximize the \n\nbandwidth of the planar antenna. Therefore, the choice of the thickness of the dielectric \n\nmaterial is a compromise between efficiency and bandwidth of the antenna [32]. The influence \n\nof the thickness on the bandwidth (BW) of the antenna may be explained by Equation (2-3), \n\nwhere Q is the antenna quality factor:  \n\n??~1/?                                                      (2-3) \n\nThe Q factor is influenced by the space wave (Qrad) losses, the conduction Ohmic (Qc) losses, \n\nthe surface waves (Qsw) and dielectric (Qd) losses as shown in Equation 2-4 [8]:  \n\n*\nC\n= *\n\nC=DE\n+ *\n\nCG\n+ *\n\nCE\n+ *\n\nCHI\n                                             (2-4) \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nFor thin substrates (h\u00ab?), where h is the thickness of the material and ? is the wavelength of \n\nthe frequency), the quality factor associated with radiation (Qrad) is usually the dominant factor \n\nand is inversely proportional to the height of the substrate [8], [32]. Therefore, increasing the \n\nheight of the substrate lowers the Q factor (Qt). As the Q-factor decreases with an increased \n\nspacing between the patch and the ground planes of the antenna, a thicker substrate yields a \n\nlarger antenna bandwidth [31]. \n\nMoreover, the thickness of the substrate also influences the geometric sizing of the antenna. \n\nThis means that a thick substrate with low dielectric constant (value between 1 and 2) results \n\nin a large patch and a thin substrate with the same dielectric constant results in a smaller patch \n\n[33]. There are commercially available fabrics with a very large range of thickness values. Plus, \n\nnominal thickness values are given in any technical data sheet, allowing a careful choice of the \n\nmaterial based on the required thickness. Moreover, accurate values of the thickness of fabrics \n\nunder specific pressure are easily obtained by simple standard methods, such as ISO 5084:1996 \n\n[34] or with the Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics [35]. Therefore, the thickness of the \n\nfabrics is a feature that may guide the search for suitable textile dielectrics.  \n\n2.2.1.2 Influence of the Moisture Content \n\nTextiles always establish a dynamic equilibrium with the temperature and humidity of the air \n\nsurrounding they are in contact with, as the fibres are constantly exchanging water molecules \n\nwith the air. However, the amount of water that a material takes until reaching this equilibrium \n\ndepends on the type of material. The extent to which a material is sensitive to moisture is \n\ndescribed by its regain, which is defined, by the ratio of the mass of absorbed water in specimen \n\nto the mass of dry specimen, expressed as a percentage [16]. In [16], page 169 shows the \n\nrelation between regain and relative humidity of the air (RH), for various textile fibres, \n\ncompiling studies made by several authors. Indeed, for the same RH conditions, there are \n\ntextile fibres with largely different moisture contents. For instance, at 65% RH, wool fibre might \n\npresent a regain of 14.5%, cotton might present a regain of 7.5% and polyester fibre might \n\npresent a regain of 0.2%.  \n\nIn general, the moisture absorption changes the properties of the fabrics. Because of this, \n\ntextile metrology is performed always in a conditioned environment (20\u00b0C and 65% RH). Also, \n\nfor commercial transactions there are national legislations setting nominal values of moisture \n\ncontent that are values close to the regain obtained at 65% RH.  \n\nWater has a dielectric constant of ?r = 78 at 2.45 GHz and 25\u00b0C [18]. Although this value depends \n\non the salinity, temperature and frequency, water has a much higher and more stable dielectric \n\nconstant than textile fabrics, whose dielectric constant is generally in the range ?r = 1 \u2013 2 \n\nbecause of their high porosity, as previously presented. Therefore, when water is absorbed by \n\nthe textile fibres or is trapped into the fabric structure, it changes the electromagnetic \n\nproperties of the fabric, increasing its dielectric constant and loss [16]\u2013[18], [22], [36]. Charts \n\npresenting the relationship between the RH of the air or the moisture content of various fibres \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nand their dielectric properties can be found in [16]. Additionally, several authors have been \n\ncorrelating the electromagnetic properties of fabrics to their absorption properties [17], [18], \n\n[37], [38].  \n\nLikewise, the absorbed water by or trapped into the textile components of the antenna \n\ndramatically changes the behaviour of the antenna. The higher permittivity of the water drives \n\nthe performance of the antenna, reducing its resonance frequency and bandwidth [18], [29], \n\n[36], [37].  \n\nBeyond these effects, when textile fibres absorb water they swell transversely and axially, \n\ncausing tightening of the fabrics [16]. This tightness affects the dimensional stability of the \n\nfabrics and therefore affects the dimensional stability of the antenna, influencing its behaviour \n\n[36].  In general, the characteristics of antennas based on textile materials with small moisture \n\nabsorption values (regain less than 3%) are more stable [18]. Therefore, materials with low \n\nregain are preferable for use as substrates and the same conclusion applies to the textile \n\nconductive components of the antenna.  \n\n2.2.2  Conductive Textiles \n\nGenerally, the fabrics are insulating materials. However, there are materials with high \n\nelectrical conductivity, which incorporate fibres, filaments or coatings of metals or conductive \n\npolymers [39]\u2013[44]. There is a large range of commercially available electrotextiles (e.g., Less \n\nEMF Inc. at http://www.lessemf.com or Shieldex Trading at http://www.shieldextrading.net) \n\nwith high conductivity, enabling the development of antennas with acceptable performance.  \n\nFabrics are planar materials and, therefore, their electrical behaviour may be quantified by \n\nthe surface (or sheet) resistance (Rs) and characterized by the surface (or sheet) resistivity (?s). \n\nThe resistance, which unit is [?], is the ratio of a DC voltage (U) to the current flowing between \n\nelectrodes that are in contact with the same face of the material under test in a specific \n\nconfiguration, as shown on Figure 2-1. In a conductivity measuring apparatus, the resistance \n\nmay be dependent on the geometry of the electrodes used for measurement. Nevertheless, \n\nresistance can be related to the sheet resistance, which is independent of the geometry of the \n\nconductor. The sheet resistance is the ratio of the DC voltage drop per unit length (L) to the \n\nsurface current (Is) per unit width (D). It is thus a property of the material, not depending on \n\nthe configuration of the electrodes used for the measurement [45]. The results of sheet \n\nresistance (Rs) are given in [?/?] [46].The sheet resistivity is then determined by multiplying \nthe sheet resistance by the thickness of the material.  \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nFigure 2-1 Basic setup for surface resistance and surface resistivity measurement \n\nThe conductivity of the fabric, which unit is Siemens per meter [S/m], is related to the sheet \nresistance by Equation (2-5), where h is the thickness of the fabric:  \n\n? =\t *\n(LH\t.\t\tM)\n\n                                                     (2-5) \n\nThe sheet resistance is usually given by the manufacturer and may be measured by standard \n\nmethods, such as, ASTM Standard D 257-99 Standard Test Method for DC Resistance or \n\nConductance of Moderately Conductive Materials [46], ASTM Standard F 1896 \u2013 Test Method for \n\nDetermine the Electrical Resistivity of a Printed Conductive Material [47], AATCC Test Method \n\n76-2011: Electrical Surface Resistivity of Fabrics [48], among others [49], [50]. Despite the \n\nexistence of several standard methods, an accurate characterization of highly conductive \n\nfabrics demands specific techniques, such as for instance the ones based on transmission lines \n\nand waveguide cavities [26], [51]\u2013[53]. \n\nBesides the dielectric constant of the substrate, the choice of the conductive fabric for the \n\npatch and the ground planes is also very important to assure a good performance of the \n\nantenna. In general, the conductive fabrics must have a very low electrical sheet resistance, \n\n?1 ?/?, in order to minimize the electric losses and thus increase the antenna efficiency. \n\nDespite the fact that the surface resistance value should be constant over the area of the \n\nantenna [36], the fabric may present some heterogeneities, such as for instance some \n\ndiscontinuities in the electric current. If these discontinuities are parallel to the surface current \n\nthey will not interfere with the electromagnetic fields [54], but if discontinuities prevents the \n\nflow of the electrical current, the fabric resistance will increase [36].  \n\nOther factors, as for instance the float, which is the length of the conductive yarns laying on \n\nthe surface of the woven, also influence the electrical behaviour of the material. The side with \n\nthe longest floats  of conductive electric wires exhibit lower sheet resistance than the other \n\nside [36]. Likewise, a higher density of conductive wires also cause lower sheet resistance [51]. \n\nFurthermore, the humidity content in the material is also an important factor to consider when \n\n\n\n 16 \n\ndetermining the electrical resistivity of textile materials, because the presence of moisture in \n\nthe fibres significantly decreases the electrical resistivity [16], [38], [52], [55]. \n\n2.3 Influence of Mechanical Deformation of Conductive \nand Dielectric Textiles \n\nFlexibility and elasticity are other requirements of the textile materials used to develop \n\nwearable antennas, in order to withstand the deformations caused by the bending angles of the \n\nhuman body. However, when the textile fabric adapts to the surface topology it bends and \n\ndeforms, causing changes to its electromagnetic properties and thus influencing the antenna \n\nperformance [29], [56]\u2013[59]. Indeed, the bending and the elongation of the dielectric fabric \n\nchange the geometric precision of the shape of the antenna, influencing its permittivity and its \n\nthickness, which affects the resonance frequency of the antenna and especially the bandwidth, \n\nas previously explained.  \n\nMoreover, knits may present higher anisotropy than woven, showing different electric surface \n\nresistance along the longitudinal and the transversal directions and this anisotropy may increase \n\nwith the knit deformation. According to Locher et al. [36], for the studied knit material that is \n\ncomposed of silver plated polyamide fibres, deformations under 8% of elongation along the \n\ndirection of the wales (see on Figure 2-2) slightly change the surface resistivity. However, when \n\nelongating the knitted fabric along the direction of the courses the electric surface resistivity \n\nresults stable up to 3% of elongation but then increases and at 8% of elongation it reaches the \n\ntriple of the initial value.  \n\n \nFigure 2-2 Schema of textile directions in (a) example of Jersey knit \u2013 wales and courses and in (b) \n\nexample of plain weave \u2013 warp and weft \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nIn addition, from the point of view of manufacturing antennas, the elasticity of the fabrics is \n\nan inconvenience as it makes difficult the precise definition and cut of the shape of the \n\ncomponents and also makes difficult the superposition of the several materials without folds. \n\nWoven and nonwovens, being more stable fabrics than knits, allow higher geometrical \n\naccuracies of the frame of the antenna. In general, the accuracy depends on the thickness of \n\nthe component yarns or fibres. For instance, conductive woven may allow an accuracy of about \n\n\u00b10.15 mm [36].  \n\n2.4 Brief Survey on Textile Materials Used in Wearable \nAntennas \n\nWearable antennas are a recent research subject [27]. One of the first proposals on the subject \n\nwas a Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) for dual-band operation, built on a flexible unspecified \n\nsubstrate, presented in 2001 by Salonen et al.[7]. It was intended to be placed in the sleeve of \n\nclothing and operate at Global System for Mobile (GSM) (900 MHz) and Bluetooth (2.4 GHz) \n\nfrequency, although the lower band was not achieved, the antenna still showed good \n\nperformance, even in human-body presence, around the 2.4 GHz band. Later in 2003, they \n\npresented an antenna built on a textile substrate intended for Wireless Local Area Network \n\n(WLAN) applications [60], where results are claimed to be acceptable. Furthermore, in 2004 \n\nSalonen et al. [28] proposed a Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna with circular \n\npolarization, in which they have experimented with five different synthetic fabric materials as \n\ndielectric substrates. The conductive parts were made of copper tape. The dielectric synthetic \n\nmaterials used were: (1) Vellux\u00ae, which is a 5 mm thick fabric covered on both surfaces with \n\nthin layers of plastic foam; (2) synthetic felt, which is a 4 mm thick nonwoven in which fibres \n\nare looser on the surface than in the centre; (3) Delinova 200\u00ae, which is a strong fabric made \n\nof polyamide Cordura\u00ae fibres laminated with Gore-Tex membrane, weighing about 370 g/m2 \n\nand having a thickness of 0.5 mm; (4) fleece, which is a very soft polyester fabric with 4 mm \n\nthickness, commonly used in sportswear; (5) upholstery fabric, which is composed of three \n\nfabric layers bound together resulting in a thin (1.1 mm) fabric of polyester and acrylic that \n\nhas firmness. The ?r, of the five fabrics was measured by a cavity perturbation method, at 1.575 \n\nGHz, and the values ranged between 1.1 and 1.7. Among the studied fabrics, the one made of \n\nhigh tenacity polyamide fibres (Cordura\u00ae) was pointed out as the more interesting fabric for \n\nthe development of a flexible antenna, because of its constant thickness and its high resistance. \n\nThese properties yield more stable geometric dimensions of the antenna. \n\nMore recent demonstrations on wearable antennas for personal area networks (PANs) to operate \n\nin the 2.45 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band and for GPS applications are \n\npresented in [33], [61]. In these examples, antennas for wearable protective clothing intended \n\nfor professional use under rough conditions are presented and their behaviour in various \n\npractical scenarios is discussed. High performance aramid fabric that can withstand high \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ntemperatures is applied as substrate while conductive textiles, like Shieldit\u00ae and Flectron\u00ae, are \n\nused for the antenna patch and ground planes. These antennas have shown acceptable \n\nperformance, even in a real environment with human-body presence and when subjected to \n\nbending and deformations. \n\nIn 2006, Locher et al. [36] have built four purely textile wearable patch antennas for Bluetooth \n\napplications. They have used three electrical conductive fabrics: (1) a nickel-plated woven \n\nfabric (with plating thickness about 250 nm applied on the fabric surface); (2) a silver-plated \n\nknitted fabric; (3) a silver-copper-nickel-plated woven fabric. Fabric (3) is the one preferred \n\nfor building textile antennas with geometric precision, as it is woven and not knitted and its \n\nelectric surface resistance was more homogeneous than the one of fabric (1). For the dielectric \n\nsubstrate, they used two types of fabrics: (1) woollen felt of 1.050 g/m2 with a thickness of 3.5 \n\nmm and (2) polyamide spacer fabric, of 530 g/m2, with a thickness of 6 mm. The felt was \n\ndimensionally more stable and harder to bend, whereas the spacer fabric was lighter and more \n\nelastic owing to its knitting-based structure. The dielectric properties were measured by a \n\ntransmission line method, at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, obtaining as results for the felt: ?r = 1.45 \n\nand tan? = 0.02, and for the spacer fabric: ?r = 1.14 and the loss tangent was negligible. The \n\nfour different antennas produced have shown good performance and could satisfy the Bluetooth \n\nspecifications, even when subjected to bending effects. However, the antennas lose their \n\ncircular polarization when subject to bending. \n\nIn the same year, Tronquo et al. [29] presented rectangular-ring textile antennas for body area \n\nnetworks (BAN) that are circularly polarized, covering a bandwidth of more than 190 MHz. For \n\nthe conductive antenna patch and ground plane they applied Flectron\u00ae, which is a thin copper \n\nplated fabric with low sheet resistance, lesser then 0.1 ?/? For the dielectric substrate they \nrelied on a fleece fabric of 2.56 mm thickness. Its dielectric properties were measured by \n\ntesting antennas and they obtained a dielectric constant of ?r = 1.25. \n\nIn 2007, Zhu and Langley [62] developed a dual-band coplanar patch antenna integrating \n\nelectromagnetic band gap material (EGB), to operate at the 2.45 and 5.8 GHz wireless bands. \n\nThe conductive parts were made of Zelt\u00ae fabric whereas the dielectric substrate was a thin \n\nfelt, with 1.1 mm thickness, and with ?r = 1.30 and tan? = 0.02. \n\nThe performance of the textile antennas presented earlier can be improved with integrated \n\nsolutions, if diverse techniques such as for instance Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) are \n\nconsidered [63], or, as shown in [64], by introducing a low-noise amplifier (LNA) in a garment \n\nto achieve an active integrated antenna, increasing the sensitivity and the gain of the overall \n\nsystem. \n\nDeclercq et al. [65] showed another integrated solution consisting of an aperture-coupled \n\nantenna on a textile and foam substrate, with a flexible solar cell for tracking and monitoring \n\nsolutions. Instead of integrating a LNA to increase the wearable antenna performance, Zhu and \n\nLangley [62], [66] developed a dual-band coplanar patch antenna, to operate in the 2.45 and \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n5.8 GHz wireless bands, in which they integrated an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) to reduce \n\nbody-presence effects and increase antenna gain. As shown in Table 1, the conductive parts \n\nwere made of Zelt\u00ae fabric while the dielectric substrate was a thin felt with ?r = 1.30 and       \n\ntan? = 0.02. They proved that the introduction of the 3x3 arrays EBG with the coplanar patch \n\ncould reduce the radiation towards the body by 10 dB, while increasing the antenna gain in        \n\n3 dB. \n\nIn order to improve flexibility in the antenna design and to achieve compact dimensions for \n\neasier antenna integration into clothing, in 2015 [67] S. Agneessens et al. designed and \n\nmanufactured a circular quarter-mode textile antenna, using Substrate Integrate Waveguides \n\n(SIW) technology, operating in the ISM band. The patch and ground planes were made of \n\nconductive e-textile copper-plated polyester plain woven fabric, with low sheet resistance 0.18 \n\n?/? at 2.45 GHz, whereas the dielectric substrate was a flexible closed-cell expanded rubber \n\nprotective foam, with 3.7 mm thickness, ?r = 1.495 and tan? = 0.016. Furthermore, this paper \n\nstudies the influence of the human body on the antenna behaviour, obtaining gains equals 3.8 \n\nand 4.2 dBi in an on-body and free space scenario, respectively. Previously, in 2014 [68], these \n\nauthors had already proposed another antenna design, a dual-band antenna for body-worn \n\napplication operating in the ISM frequency bands 2.4 and 5.8 GHz, using the same materials \n\ndescribed above. In this SIW technology, several wearable antennas were implemented with \n\nconductive fabrics and diverse flexible substrates, including 3D knit and cork [69]\u2013[71]. \n\nIn the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) context, the miniaturization of the tag technology \n\nbrought significant advances in this field, improving their functionality and applicability. \n\nNowadays, the size of the RFID tag depends on the constraints of the antenna. For this reason, \n\nthe design of suitable antennas continues to be challenging. Based on this framework, some \n\nauthors have been investigating textile antennas for commercial advertisement proposes, such \n\nas brand names and logotypes. Elmahgoub et al. [72] in 2010 proposed two RFID tags based on \n\nthe merge of logos from The University of Mississippi (TUM) and Tampere University of \n\nTechnology (TUT). The authors applied four different substrates, (1) PET - Polyethylene \n\nTerephthalate film, (2) thin film, (3) paper and (4) fabric, and applied three manufacturing \n\ntechniques: (A) manual cutting, (B) stitching and (C) screen print, in order to verify the \n\nefficiency of the designed logo. In the textile fabric case, despite the woven fabric used as \n\ndielectric substrate remains unspecified, the most promising results in terms of conductivity \n\nand performance by screen printing with silver ink. Using the materials described above (3 and \n\nC), two tags have been proposed: one operating at 866 MHz and another at 915 MHz. Both tags \n\nperformed well when compared with simulation, and long read distances of 11.2 and 7 meters, \n\nwere achieved respectively.  \n\nNot only limited to RFID tags, Tak and Choi in 2015 [73], developed a Luis Vuitton logo antenna \n\nfor integration into a handbag. This dual-band antenna, for ISM 2.45GHz and 4.5 GHz, was \n\ndesigned and fabricated using five layers of sheepskin-leather substrate with 0.7 mm thickness \n\nfor each layer (3.5 mm in total), ?r = 2.5 and tan? = 0.035. For the conductive parts, Zell\n\u00ae fabric \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n(Shieldex Trading, Palmyra, USA), with Rs = 0.02 ?/? and 0.1 mm thickness was used. The \nantenna is essentially a microstrip patch antenna, in which the patch assumes the form of the \n\nLouis Vuitton logo. It achieves dual band operation due to its characteristic structure. The size \n\nof the logo was obtained through optimization in order to match its input impedance in the ISM \n\nbands. The radiation pattern is expected to be directive. However, due to the large losses of \n\nthe dielectric, the efficiencies fall short at 15.2% at 2.49 GHz, and at 41.4% at 4.52 GHz, \n\nyielding gains of -0.29 dBi and 3.05 dBi, respectively. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to consider \n\nthis antenna for IoT applications, which usually comprises short distances of communication. \n\nTable 2-2 summarizes the several textile materials that have been applied to develop wearable \n\nantennas. \n\nTable 2-2 Summary of the textile materials that have been used on the design of wearable antennas \n\nRef.

[18] an alteration of no more than 0.5 mm \n\non the length or the width of the patch influenced the performance of the antenna by causing \n\na slight shift of the antenna characteristics. For this reason, woven fabrics, being more stable, \n\nare preferred to make the patches. However, the antenna geometrical stability can be achieved \n\nif at least one component is less deformable. For example, bonding using an adhesive sheet \n\nwith a deformable patch, such as a conductive knit, with a less deformable substrate, such a \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nwoven dielectric, results in a stable frame [28], [36].  \n\nThe techniques used to connect the various layers must not affect the electrical properties of \n\nthe patch, such as its surface resistivity, nor the permittivity of the substrate. Connections \n\nusing adhesive sheets or conductive fabrics with a thermal adhesive face have shown good \n\nresults [33], [36], [37], [73], [75]. This process of attachment of the superposed layers is very \n\nsimple to perform by a simple ironing operation. However, attention should be made to the \n\nironing process, in special if the patch is made of a fabric with metallic components. Indeed, \n\nthe oxidation of the metallic component, due to the hot moistening of the fabric, may increase \n\nthe surface resistance of the fabric and so decrease the efficiency of the textile antenna [51], \n\n[76].  \n\nConnection with seams is an alternative technique [28], [29], [36], [58] but it presents some \n\ndifficulties. Firstly, the seam must be plane, without wrinkling, what might be difficult to \n\nachieve with deformable materials. Secondly, the stitch passes through all materials: the \n\npatch, then the substrate and further the ground plane of the antenna, which may cause \n\nelectrical shorts between them. In Locher et al. [36] report that the sewing needle has pulled \n\nconductive fibres from the patch through the substrate, shorting the patch with the ground \n\nplane.  \n\nAnother technique is connecting with liquid adhesives. However, it is difficult to apply a thin \n\nlayer of glue. This difficulty introduces heterogeneity and in the zones where there are \n\naccumulations the glue may play the role of insulator between the conductive yarns of the \n\npatch. Furthermore, these adhesives are usually stiff and brittle, and so they cannot be applied \n\nin an area-wide manner on textiles as they will interfere in their flexibility [36]. In order to \n\nobtain a uniform thickness of the attachment of the several layers, Tronquo et al. [29], [30] \n\nperform an additional stitch, in addition to the glue. Also, in [33] a smooth fabric was added \n\nto both faces of the substrate to optimise the attachment of the conductive components.  \n\nThe positioning of the textile components must consider the differences between right and \n\nback faces, in terms of roughness and of density of conductive elements [51], [52], [77]. In \n\n[51], [77], a satin 5 woven was tested in a microstrip resonator, placing it in two positions: (1) \n\nwith the right face against the dielectric substrate and (2) with the back face, the conductive \n\none, against the dielectric substrate. It was observed that when the conductive face is placed \n\non the top of the substrate and so underneath the nonconductive yarns of the nonconductive \n\nface, most of the electrical field is contained in the substrate. Thus, the dielectric loss in the \n\nnonconductive yarns is minimized.  \n\nBesides the use of conductive fabrics, several other ways to manufacture the conductive parts \n\nof the antenna have been explored, such as embroidering and screen printing. Matthews and \n\nPettit presented in [78] three types of antennas, which are integrated into clothing: a \n\nbroadband wire dipole, a bowtie and a spiral antenna, operating in frequencies from 100 MHz \n\nto 1 GHz. They have tested different materials (textiles and others), different frames and \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nmanufacturing techniques. Among the tested conductive materials there are conductive ribbon, \n\nconductive paint and ink, conductive nylon fabric (that is also adhesive on the back face), \n\nphosphor bronze mesh fabric (also adhesive on the back face), conductive thread, liquid crystal \n\npolymer (LCP) and copper coated fabric. The phosphor bronze mesh, LCP and copper coated \n\nfabric have the advantage that the antennas can be directly soldered onto. In some antennas, \n\na conducting epoxy was used to bond the materials, but this results in some lack of robustness. \n\nIn terms of radio frequency (RF) performance of the designed antennas, the spiral antenna, \n\nwhere the spiral is embroidered with conductive thread, performed worse than any other \n\nantenna and was clearly lossy. Overall, based on RF performance, they concluded the most \n\nattractive materials to design wearable antennas were the textile fabrics: the conductive nylon \n\nand the copper coated fabrics. \n\nIn [74] the stability and efficiency of wearable and washable antennas are discussed for textile \n\nantennas in which the conductive parts were screen printed with conductive ink. These \n\nantennas have shown acceptable performance. The combination of screen-printing with a \n\nbreathable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coating ensured that performance was \n\nmaintained even after several wash cycles. Also in [79] the authors were used screen printing \n\ntechnique to manufacture a rectenna for 2.45 GHz for RF power transfer and harvesting. In this \n\nwork, to reduce the surface roughness insuring the continuous conductivity of the conductive \n\nlayer, an interface ink layer was applied between the textile substrate and the conductive ink. \n\nBesides the interface layer increase the losses on the dielectric substrate, the measured and \n\nthe simulated S11 of antenna\n3, agree very well. \n\nAn embroidered technique was applied in [62], [66] to sew conductive fibres into polymer and \n\nfabric substrates. It was proved that by increasing the density of the embroidering stitching, \n\nthe conductivity of the conductive section increases as well as the accuracy of the fabricated \n\nprototypes, yielding better agreement with the simulations. Dipole, spiral and microstrip patch \n\nantennas were fabricated with this technique. They yielded very good RF performance when \n\ncompared to the corresponding rigid copper structures.  \n\nFinally, the connections at the antenna terminals may also be critical as in wearable and \n\nflexible antennas these connections have to be mechanically robust. In general, textile fabrics \n\ncannot be directly soldered to (an exception is Flectron\u00ae\n \nthat already showed good resistance \n\nto soldering [33]). Therefore, conductive epoxy has been used, but some concerns remain as \n\nthis connection is not very resistant [78]. \n\nA promising way to produce conductive elements is integrating conductive wires into the \n\ntextiles through the three-dimensional (3D) weaving technique. This technique may contribute \n\nto improving the mechanical robustness and to eliminating the influence of the glue and/or \n\nseam [80].  \n\n                                                   \n3\n see the S11 (return loss) definition on Appendix A. \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n2.6 Conclusions \n\nThe developed wearable antennas are mainly planar ones, specifically microstrip patch \n\nantennas, because they mainly radiate perpendicularly to the planar structure and also their \n\nground plane efficiently shields the human body. The bandwidth and efficiency performance of \n\na planar microstrip antenna is mainly determined by the substrate dielectric constant and its \n\nthickness.  \n\nIn general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant, between 1 and 2, as they are very \n\nporous materials and the presence of air approaches the relative permittivity to one. The low \n\ndielectric constant reduces the surface wave losses that are tied to guided wave propagation \n\nwithin the substrates. Therefore, lowering the dielectric constant increases spatial waves and \n\nhence increases the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. However, lowering the substrate \n\npermittivity can also increase the resonance frequency of the antenna, allowing the \n\ndevelopment of antennas with acceptable efficiency and high gain.  \n\nIn addition, the ability of the fibres to absorb moisture must also be considered in the \n\ncharacterization of the dielectric behaviour of textiles. Water has a much higher and more \n\nstable dielectric constant than textile fabrics. Therefore, when water is absorbed by the textile \n\nfibres or is trapped in the fabric structure, it changes the electromagnetic properties of the \n\nfabric, increasing its dielectric constant and loss tangent. Likewise, the absorbed water by or \n\ntrapped into the textile substrate reduces the resonance frequency and bandwidth of the \n\nantenna. In general, the characteristics of antennas based on textile materials with small \n\nmoisture absorption (regain less than 3%) are more stable. Therefore, materials with such low \n\nregain values are preferable for use as substrates and as conductive components of the antenna.  \n\nThe thickness of the dielectric material is also crucial in the design of antennas. For a fixed \n\nrelative permittivity, the substrate thickness may be chosen to maximize the bandwidth of the \n\nplanar antenna. However, this value may not optimize the antenna efficiency. Therefore, the \n\nchoice of the thickness of the dielectric material is a compromise between efficiency and \n\nbandwidth of the antenna. Moreover, the thickness of the substrate also influences the \n\ngeometric sizing of the antenna.  \n\nThe conductive fabrics for the patch and the ground planes must have a very low electrical \n\nsheet resistance in order to minimize the electric losses and so increase the antenna efficiency. \n\nThere are several conductive textile fabrics, and also yarns, available on the market that have \n\nbeen successfully used in planar antennas. Coated fabrics might perform worse than the fabrics \n\nhaving conductive fibres, because of discontinuities that may increase the surface resistivity. \n\nWoven and nonwovens, being more stable fabrics than knits, allow higher geometrical \n\naccuracies of the frame of the antenna and thus may be preferred to make the patch. In \n\ngeneral, the sizing accuracy of the patch made of woven fabric depends on the thickness of the \n\ncomponent yarns.  \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nFinally, after choosing the textile materials, their assemblage may also be critical, as the \n\nelongation and bending causes mechanical deformations that interfere with the antenna \n\nbehaviour. The presence of at least one textile material presenting high tensile strength, high \n\nbending rigidity and stable geometry stabilizes the frame of the antenna. When connecting the \n\nvarious layers making up the antenna, the positioning of the textile fabrics must consider \n\ndifferences between right and back faces in terms of roughness and of density of conductive \n\nelements, in order to minimize losses.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n3 Chapter \n\n \n\nDielectric Characterization Methods Applied to \n\nTextiles Materials: A Survey  \n\n \n\nThe content of this Chapter was partially published as Chapter on the Book Wearable \n\nTechnologies and Wireless Body Sensor Networks for Healthcare (2017).  \n\nThe accurate characterization of conventional textile materials to use as dielectric substrates \n\nin wearable systems is fundamental. However, little information can be found on the \n\nelectromagnetic properties of regular textiles. Woven, knits and nonwovens are \n\ninhomogeneous, highly porous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental \n\nhygrometric conditions, making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there \n\nis no standard method, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric \n\ncharacterization of textiles. This survey gives an overview of the resonant and non-resonant \n\nmethods to characterize the textile materials and leather, to be used as dielectric substrate \n\non wearable antennas. Also, this Chapter summarizes the characterization of textile materials \n\nmade through these methods and that were validated by testing antennas which perform well. \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction  \nThe knowledge of the electromagnetic properties of the materials is essential to a good design \n\nof the antenna. As reviewed on Chapter 2, many criteria should be considered, as several \n\ncharacteristics of the textile materials directly affect the behaviour of the antenna. Specific \n\nelectrically-conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used in \n\nthe radiating components. Conventional textile fabrics have been used as substrates. However, \n\nlittle information can be found on the electromagnetic properties of these regular textiles. \n\nSince [81], during the past century, several textile engineers have studied the dielectric \n\nproperties of single fibres [16]. The main challenge founded on these works was the \n\nheterogeneity of air and fibres. Lather, in 2010, Bal and Kothari have reported a comparison of \n\nformulas for the air fibre mixture, used in the dielectric characterization [21]. Besides the large \n\nreports on the fibre context, only few researches on the characterization of fabrics were \n\nfounded.  \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nThe dielectric behaviour of textiles depends on the properties of the component fibres and the \n\nstructure of the yarns and/or of the fabrics, and on the fibre packing density in the fibrous \n\nmaterial [16], [22]. Also, being textiles highly porous materials, the presence of air and \n\nmoisture influences their dielectric characterization.  \n\nDespite the growth of research studies on textile antennas, the accurate characterization of \n\nthe dielectric properties of the textile materials is still a challenge due to the intrinsic \n\ninhomogeneity and deformability of textiles [82]. Up today there is no standard method to \n\nmeasure the dielectric properties of textiles.  \n\nThe main objective of the methods for the electromagnetic characterization of dielectric \n\nmaterials is to measure the relative permittivity of the specimen for a specific frequency, or \n\nbandwidth frequency, and field orientation [15]. The methods for the characterization of the \n\ndielectric properties that have been used are generally subdivided into two main categories: \n\nresonant and non-resonant methods [13]. Each of these categories includes several procedures. \n\nThe following Subsections describe the ones that have already been proposed and applied to \n\ncharacterize textile materials. \n\n3.2  Non-resonant Methods \nThe non-resonant methods mainly include procedures based on reflection and \n\ntransmission/reflection measurements. As the reflection-based techniques, the dielectric \n\nproperties of the Material Under Test (MUT) are extracted based on the reflection of the \n\nelectromagnetic waves in free space by the sample [13]. In transmission/reflection methods, \n\nthe dielectric properties are calculated based on the reflection from and transmission through \n\nthe sample [13]. For the characterization of textile materials, several non-resonant methods \n\nhave been tested, such as transmission lines [12], [76], [83]\u2013[85], metallic and dielectric \n\nwaveguides [26] and free space [11], [62]-[63]. \n\n3.2.1  Parallel Plate Method \n\nThe parallel plate method is the oldest way to measure the dielectric properties in fibre \n\nmaterials [81]. In this method, the material under test is placed between two parallel plates, \n\nas shown on Figure 3-1. In this case, the structure creates a capacitor whose capacity is \n\nmeasured by a LCR meter4. Owing to the simplicity of the procedure and the power measured \n\nby the LCR, this method is limited to the maximum 1 MHz frequency. Details about the \n\ntheoretical equations can be found in [12]-[13]. In [89], nine textile fabrics were characterized \n\nat 200 kHz, under controlled ambient conditions to avoid the influence of moisture. The \n\nobtained results are summarized in following Table 3-1. \n\n                                                   \n4\n LCR meter is an electronic equipment used to measure the inductance (L), capacitance (C) and resistance \n\n(R) of an electronic component.  \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n \nFigure 3-1 Parallel plate method \n\n3.2.2  Planar Transmission Lines Methods \n\nPlanar transmission lines methods are the most common methods applied to characterize \n\ntextile materials. Based on the scattering (S-) parameters, the advantage of this method is that \n\nit can also be applied to determine conductive properties, as presented in [14]-[15]. The planar \n\ntransmission lines are subdivided into three types: microstrip, coplanar and stripline ones, as \n\nillustrated on Figure 3-2. \n\nAs shown on Figure 3-2 (d), the stripline consists of upper and lower grounding planes, and a \n\ncentral conductive line. The dielectric material under test is placed between the grounding \n\nplanes and the central line. The advantage of this structure of transmission line is that the \n\nradiation losses are negligible. In [83], a stripline prototype was built to characterize a denim \n\nfabric, 100% cotton, at 2.45 GHz. For the conductive parts Flectron\u00ae fabric was applied and to \n\ndesign the transmission line they used an estimated ?r = 1.2. As this stripline required h = 2.45 \n\nmm, five layers of denim fabric were superposed. The measurements with the VNA yielded ?r = \n\n2.117 and tan? = 0.01. To validate this method, a microstrip patch antenna for 2.45 GHz was \n\ndesigned and manufactured using the same materials. The antenna has shown good \n\nperformance and 6.1594 dBi of gain was obtained.  \n\n \nFigure 3-2 Types of transmission lines: (a) microstrip, (b) coplanar waveguide, (c) coplanar waveguide \nwith ground plane and (d) stripline. Where: h and t are the thickness of the dielectric and conductive \nmaterials, respectively; w is the length of the line and g is the gap between the line and the ground plane  \n\nin coplanar lines; Wgnd is the length of the ground plane, respectively \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nIn [84], Mantash  et al. propose a comparison between a stripline and an open stub resonator, \n\ndescribed in [91], to characterize felt and denim fabric. For the stub resonator, a copper tape \n\nwas used for the conductive parts. Measuring at a non-specified single frequency, for the denim \n\nthey extract ?r = 1.6 and tan? = 0.05, and for felt ?r = 1.22 and tan? = 0.016. As to the broadband \n\nmeasurements, the authors have used a stripline fixture resonator for the dielectric material. \n\nThe results between 1 GHz and 6 GHz have shown a range of values from ?r = 1.215 to ?r = 1.225 \n\nfor the felt material, and from ?r = 1.6 to ?r = 1.65 for the denim fabric. Comparing the obtained \n\nresults from the two methods, both are acceptable. In order to validate the results, two patch \n\nantennas for 2.45 GHz were proposed, using the permittivity value extracted at single \n\nfrequency, and Shieldit\u00ae Super fabric (Rs =&lt;0.5 ?/?) for the conductive parts. These antennas \nhave shown a good agreement between the results and the simulated parameters.  \n\nThe propagation characteristics of two microstip transmission lines with different lengths were \n\nmeasured in [85]. The lines were made using Nora\u00ae fabric, with Rs = 0.03 ?/?, for the \nconductive parts, and an acrylic fabric with 0.5 mm of thickness for the dielectric substrate. \n\nKnowing the length difference and measuring the S-parameters between 3 and 10 GHz, the \n\npermittivity value for the acrylic fabric was calculated: ?r = 2.6. In order to validate the method, \n\ntwo Ultra Wilde-Band (UWB) (3.1 - 10.6 GHz) wearable antennas were designed. The measured \n\nantenna parameters have shown to be in agreement with simulation estimations. Besides, the \n\nantennas have been tested for transmission of UWB pulses into the human body in order to \n\nevaluate reflectivity, which can be used in diagnosis applications. Moreover, they have proven \n\nto be reliable when in close contact with the human body, proving the usefulness of the \n\ndevelopment of such antennas in textiles. \n\nIn [79] the authors have used the two-lines technique as well. They characterize a fabric, whose \n\nfibrous composition is 65% PES and 35% CO, to use as a dielectric substrate of patch antenna \n\nfor 2.45 GHz RF power transfer and harvesting. The fabric showed ?r = 3.23 and tan? = 0.06. \n\nThe measurement of the S11 of screen printed antenna shows an excellent agreement with the \n\nsimulated results. \n\nIn [76], the authors have combined the two-lines method for microstrip lines with the matrix-\n\npencil technique, in order to reduce the perturbations in the parameters of the transmission \n\nlines. They have characterized four different materials: (1) woven fabric, 98% aramid and 2% \n\ncarbon, with h= 0.60 mm and ?r = 1.57; (2) woven fabric, 98% aramid and 2% carbon, with h= \n\n0.40 mm and ?r = 1.91; (3) nonwoven polypropylene fabric with h= 3.60 mm and ?r = 1.18; (4) \n\nfleece with h= 2.56 mm and ?r = 1.25. For the conductive parts, copper sheet and Flectron\u00ae \n\nfabric were used to manufacture the transmission lines. The authors concluded that the lines \n\nusing copper sheet enabled to estimate the loss tangent of the substrates under test, given that \n\nthe losses in copper sheet are much smaller than in the Flectron\u00ae. To validate this method, the \n\nauthors designed three textile antennas for 2.45 GHz, using the tested materials (1, 2 and 3) \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nas dielectric substrate. For the conductive parts, copper sheets and Flectron\u00ae fabric were used, \n\nand both copper and Flectron\u00ae based antennas exhibited good results.  \n\n3.2.3  Free Space Methods \n\nThis method typically consists in placing the material under test between two horn antennas, \n\nas show on Figure 3-3. By measuring the S-parameters - transmission (S11) and reflection (S21) \n\ncoefficients - of the antennas with a VNA, the dielectric constant is estimated. The main \n\nadvantage of the free space method is that it is contactless and non-destructive. The main \n\ndrawback of this method is the required precise calibration of the horn antennas. \n\n \nFigure 3-3 Free-space measurement system \n\nIn [86], this method was used to measure the dielectric properties of textile composites. The \n\nresults of these characterizations can be found on Table 3-1. Furthermore, in [88] the authors \n\npresent a variation of this method, based on an angular-invariant approach. Due the typical \n\nnon-regular surface of the textiles and leathers, in this angular-invariant approach based on \n\nRayleigh scattering, the authors have measured the scattering parameters of the antenna by \n\nvarying the angle of the material under the test. All materials tested in this work have shown \n\nvariations in the complex permittivity as a function of the different incidence angles, due to \n\nirregular thickness, surface roughness and texture of the materials. Also, the free-space \n\nmethod can be used to characterize the conductive textiles [87]. \n\nTable 3-1 Summary of non-resonant methods to characterize textile materials and leather \n\nRef. \nFrequency \napplication \n\nMaterial \nThickness \n\n(mm) ?r \ntan?

The resonance-\n\nperturbation method is based on resonant perturbation theory. For a resonator with given \n\nelectromagnetic boundaries, when part of the electromagnetic boundary condition is changed \n\nby introducing a sample, its resonant frequency and quality factor (Q-factor) will also change. \n\nMeasuring these shifts in the frequency and in the Q-factor is possible to extract the \n\npermittivity value, as presented in [13]. The Q-factor [13] is a parameter often used to describe \n\nan electromagnetic material, according to equations (3-1), (3-2) and (3-3): \n\n?O =\n<>=\n<>>=\n\n=\t *\nPQRST\n\n                                                           (3-1) \n\n?U =\nV>=\nV>>=\n\n=\t *\nPQRSW\n\n                                                                      (3-2) \n\nwhere Qe is the electric quality factor and Qm is the magnetic quality factor. Based on this, it \n\nis possible to calculate the total quality factor (Q) of the material:   \n\n*\nC\n=\t *\n\nCT\n+\t *\n\nCW\n                                                                            (3-3) \n\n3.3.1  Cavity Perturbation Methods \n\nThe most common resonance techniques are those based on resonant cavities formed by a \n\nrectangular or circular waveguide. The material under test is inserted into the resonant cavity \n\nand their electromagnetic properties are calculated from the changes in the resonant frequency \n\nand in the quality factor of the cavity caused by the introduction of the material [13], [92]\u2013\n\n[94]. This phenomenon is illustrated on Figure 3-4 and the theoretical equations can be found \n\nin [13]. \n\n \nFigure 3-4  Cavity perturbation (a) original cavity (b) perturbed cavity after the material insertion. E1 \nand H1 are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively; ?1 and \u00b51 are the permittivity and permeability \nof the cavity; Vc is the volume of the cavity; ?2 and \u00b52 are the permittivity and permeability of the  \n\nmaterial; and Vs is the volume of the sample \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nThese methods are difficult to apply as in every measurement the sample has to be placed in \n\nthe same position. Figure 3-5 shows some examples of resonant cavities. Also, the cavity needs \n\nto be dismantled and reassembled every time a new sample is tested [13], consuming time and \n\nmaybe introducing errors on the measurements. Moreover, the cavity resonator methods \n\nmeasure the permittivity in the plane of the sample and, therefore, cannot determine any \n\nanisotropy in the measured plane [14].  \n\n \nFigure 3-5  Examples of resonant cavities: (a) circular resonator cavity (b) rectangular resonator cavity \n\nIn [94], Kumar and Smith present the electromagnetic characterization of yarns and fabrics \n\nusing a cylindrical split cavity resonator. In this work, the averaged result obtained for five \n\nyarns with different diameters, ?r = 3.1141, is compared to the averaged result for three fabrics \n\nmade with these yarns ?r = 2.7851. As the textile materials are a mixture of nylon fibres and \n\nair, the authors concluded that fabrics exhibit higher porosity and, for this reason, a lower \n\npermittivity value than the yarns measured stand-alone.  \n\nFurthermore, [90] presents the dielectric characterization of nine textiles, using a closed cavity \n\nresonator. The authors have measured the textiles in all planes (x, y and z). The obtained \n\nresults showed the influence of different alignments of the material with the electromagnetic \n\nfield. The anisotropy caused by the different density of yarns in the warp and weft directions \n\nis clearly seen. \n\n3.3.2  Microstrip Resonator Ring Method \n\nThe microstrip resonator methods are based in the resonance-perturbation method.  The \n\nsample of the material under test is placed over the microstrip resonator affecting its resonant \n\nfrequency and quality factor. Measuring the shift in the frequency and in the Q-factor enables \n\nto extract the permittivity values [13]. The microstrip resonator methods are subdivided into \n\nthree types: straight ribbon resonator, ring resonator and circular resonator, as shown on Figure \n\n3-6. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \nFigure 3-6  Types of microstrip resonators: (a) straight ribbon resonator (b) ring resonator and (c) circular \nresonator. Where: l is the length of straight ribbon resonator; r1 and r2 are the inner and outer radius of  \n\nthe resonator ring, respectively; and r is the radius of the circular resonator \n \n\nThe microstrip ring resonator does not have open ends, decreasing the radiation loss and \n\nconsequently increasing the quality factor. For this reason, the ring resonator is more accurate \n\nand sensitive than the straight and circular resonators. Details about the theoretical equations \n\nof microstrip resonator can be found in [13]. For the characterization of the textile materials, \n\nthe procedure of the microstrip ring resonator method only involves attach the conductive \n\nparts, made of copper foil, to the textile dielectric probe under test. In [95],  the \n\ncharacterization of a \u201cBakhram\u201d textile fabric at two different frequencies (831.940 MHz and \n\n1.6890 MHz) is presented. After the measurements, the permittivity and loss tangent extracted \n\nvalues were ?r = 2.031 and tan? = 0.0038, and ?r = 1.965 and tan? = 0.0024, respectively. To \n\nvalidate the method, the authors designed a textile patch antenna to resonate at 831.940 MHz, \n\nalso made of copper foil in the conductive parts. Despite the deviation in the measured \n\nfrequency, the authors considered the characterization method well suited for the \n\ncharacterization of textile materials, considering this deviation as part of the design and \n\nmanufacturing process of the antenna.  \n\n3.3.3  Microstrip Patch Sensor \n\nThe microstrip patch sensor consists of a patch antenna covered with the dielectric material \n\nunder test, called superstrate, as shown on Figure 3-7. As for the microstrip ring resonator \n\nmethod, this technique relies on the resonance-perturbation method, where the calculation of \n\nthe permittivity value is based on the shift in frequency caused by the introduction of the \n\nsuperstrate. More information about theoretical equations can be found in [96]\u2013[98]. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \n\nFigure 3-7 Setup up of dielectric material covering a patch antenna  \n\nIn [97], this method is presented to measure solids and liquids. In [98], the method is used to \n\ntest six nonwoven materials at 1.9 GHz. All tested nonwoven materials were manufactured by \n\nthe stitching method and the results of their electromagnetic characterization are presented \n\nin Table 3-2. This non-destructive method can be a solution for a quick, easy and low-cost \n\ncharacterization procedure.  \n\n3.3.4  Microstrip Resonator Patch Method \n\nIn [20], Sankaralingam and Bhaskar proposed a novel microstrip patch radiator method, that \n\nconsists in designing a patch antenna using an estimated permittivity value found by literature \n\nreview. After manufacturing the antenna and measuring its S11, the real value of the dielectric \n\nconstant is calculated based on the shift of the resonant frequency. Six different textile \n\nmaterials were characterized and the extracted values can be found in Table 3-2. To validate \n\nthis method, the authors designed some textile antennas for 2.45 GHz, using three tested \n\nmaterials as a dielectric substrate, and copper sheets for the conductive parts. Despite that \n\nthese antennas exhibit good results, confirming the suitability of this method, the results can \n\nbe influenced by the manufacturing technique. Indeed, the use of an interface to assembly the \n\nlayers, such as glue or an adhesive sheet, and the inaccuracies when soldering the SMA \n\nconnector to the microstrip patch radiator, can introduce errors in the final values.  \n\n3.3.5  Agilent 85070E Dielectric Measurement Probe Kit \n\nThe Agilent 85070E Dielectric Measurement Probe Kit, is an equipment by Agilent Technologies, \n\navailable on the market to measure the dielectric properties of several types of materials [99]. \n\nIn [73], the characterisation of textile and leather was performed using the open-ended coaxial \n\nprobe method. In this method, the permittivity value is calculated only from the S11 parameter \n\nfrom the coaxial probe, measured with the VNA or impedance analyser, as illustrated on Figure \n\n3-8. On the one side, the advantages of this method are: non-destructive technique, quick and \n\neasy to perform. On the other side, this method is very expensive (price of probe kit + software) \n\nand a complex calibration of the probe is required, using standard materials such as distilled \n\nwater or methanol. \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nFive types of leather were characterized at 2.45 GHz: (1) original cowhide, ?r = 1.76 and         \n\ntan? = 0.0009, (2) original sheepskin ?r = 2.5 and tan? = 0.035, (3) oiled sheepskin ?r = 2.66 and \n\ntan? = 0.085, (4) scratched cowhide ?r = 3.13 and tan? = 0.15, and (5) oiled cowhide ?r = 2.3 \n\nand tan? = 0.04. Among the characterized leathers, considering the operating frequency, \n\nleather (2) was chosen to develop a dual-band wearable antenna for 2.45 GHz and 4.5 GHz \n\napplications. Due to the structure of five-layered substrate, the simulated and measured results \n\ndeviate. For this reason, the authors included a new simulation using four air gaps of 0.0875 \n\nmm thickness to correct the results. The size of the air gaps was obtained through the \n\ndifference between the simulated substrate thickness (3.5 mm) and the measured thickness of \n\nthe final substrate (3.85 mm). The gain and the radiation efficiency at the lower frequency \n\n(2.49 GHz) are -0.29 dBi and 15.2%, respectively; and at the higher frequency (4.52 GHz) 3.05 \n\ndBi and 41.4%, respectively.  \n\nIn [100] a denim fabric was characterized using the open-ended coaxial probe method, as well. \n\nThe denim fabric, with 1.6 mm of thickness, was show ?r = 1.7 and tan? = 0.085; and was used \n\nas dielectric substrate for a slotted antenna for RF energy harvesting between 2.22 \u2013 2.59 GHz. \n\n \n\nFigure 3-8 Schematic of the coaxial probe by Agilent Measurement Kit \n\n Table 3-2 Summary of resonant methods to characterize textile materials and leather \n\nRef. \nFrequency \napplication \n\nMaterial \nThickness \n\n(mm) ?r \ntan?

Also, was presented in The Fiber Society \n\nConference (2016 and 2017) - the paper presented in 2017, received the 3rd place in The Fiber \n\nSociety Graduate Student Paper Competition. The experimental research presented in this \n\nChapter was developed during the Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM), in the framework of \n\nthe European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) \u2013 Project IC 1301 \u2013 Wireless Power \n\nTransmission for Sustainable Electronics (WIPE), held on the Department of Information \n\nTechnology of Ghent University (Belgium), under the supervision of Prof. PhD. Hendrik Rogier.  \n\nThe knowledge of the electromagnetic properties of the textile materials is crucial to design \n\nwearable antennas. Despite the increase of research studies on textile antennas, the accurate \n\ncharacterization of the dielectric properties of textile materials is still a challenge due to the \n\nintrinsic inhomogeneity and deformability of textiles. In this Chapter, the Resonator-Based \n\nExperimental Technique is presented. This method is based on the theory of resonance-\n\nperturbation, extracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based on the shifts caused \n\nby the introduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. The results obtained \n\nusing this method have shown that when positioning the roughest face of the MUT in contact \n\nwith the resonator board, the extracted dielectric constant value is lower than the one \n\nextracted with this face positioned upside-down. Based on this observation, superficial \n\nproperties of textiles were investigated. Thus, this paper relates the results of the dielectric \n\ncharacterization to some structural parameters of textiles, such as surface roughness, \n\nsuperficial and bulk porosities. The results show that both roughness and superficial porosity \n\nof the samples influence the measurements, through the positioning of the probes. Further, \n\nthe influence of the positioning of the dielectric material on the performance of textile \n\nmicrostrip antennas was analysed. For this, twelve prototypes of microstrip patch antennas \n\nwere developed and tested. The results show that, despite the differences obtained on the \n\ncharacterization when placing the face or reverse-sides of the MUT in contact with the \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nresonator board, the obtained average result of ?r is well suited to design antennas ensuring \n\na good performance.  \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \nTo alleviate the problems and complexity of the sample preparation, the influence of the \n\nconductive material and the expensive equipment required in the methods described on \n\nChapter 3, an experimental resonator-based technique was developed. It is based on the \n\nresonance-perturbation theory, based on similar principles as the microstrip patch sensor \n\ntechnique presented in 3.3.3. However, the method outlined on this Section relies on full-wave \n\nsimulators rather than approximating formulas for the extraction of the electromagnetic \n\nproperties of the MUT, thus yielding an overall higher accuracy. More specifically, it consists in \n\ncomputing the electromagnetic parameters of the MUT by comparing the simulated and \n\nmeasured shifts in the resonance frequency and in the value of Q-factor of a microstrip patch \n\nantenna. These shifts are caused by the introduction of a superstrate on the patch that is the \n\nmaterial under study, MUT.  \n\nIndeed, the presence of the superstrate will change the characteristics of the antenna, such as \n\nresonance frequency, as shown on Figure 4-1. This shift in the frequency (fr1 \u2013 fr2) is caused by \n\nthe difference of the electromagnetic wavelength of the uncovered antenna, simulated during \n\nthe design process, and the measured antenna covered by a dielectric material of unknown ?r. \n\nThe amplitude of the frequency shift depends on the ?r and on the thickness of the covering \n\nmaterial. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-1 Measurement results from the patch antenna stand-alone and after the introduction of \nsuperstrate \n\nThe test equipment consists of a board on which a microstrip patch antenna is implemented \n\nand in a vector network analyser to perform the measurements. The antenna is designed to \n\noperate at 2.25 GHz, thus in the proximity of the 2.45 GHz, ISM frequency band, which is \n\nparamount for wearable systems. The antenna is realized on a rigid I-Tera MT40 high-frequency \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nlaminate, with ?r = 3.56, tan? = 0.0035 and thickness h = 0.508 mm, whereas the patch is etched \n\nin a copper layer with a thickness of 35 \u00b5m. It is fed by a coaxial line through the SMA connector, \n\nwith 50? of impedance. The designed antenna is shown on Figure 4-2 and its dimensions are \n\ngiven on Table 4-1. Also, the measurement set-up of the resonator-based experimental \n\ntechnique is illustrated on Figure 4-3. To stabilise the planar geometry of the MUT and avoid \n\nlarge air gaps between the MUT and the microstrip patch antenna of the resonator board, a \n\nblock of Styrofoam was placed over the MUT. All dielectric measurements were performed in \n\nDepartment of Technology Information at Ghent University. \n\n \n\n \n(a)                                                            (b) \n\nFigure 4-2 Design of microstrip patch antenna resonating at 2.25 GHz (a) front and (b) rear \n\nTable 4-1 Dimensions of microstrip patch antenna used on Resonator-Based Experimental Technique  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-3 Setup of resonator-based experimental technique \n\nParameter Dimensions (mm) \nWsub, Lsub 100, 100 \n\nW, L 36.5, 36 \nWin, Lin, Wms 3, 10, 1.2 \n\nWgnd, Lgnd 100, 100 \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n4.1.1  Experimental Procedure \n\nIn order to extract the ?r and tan? of the textile fabric under test, the following procedure is \n\ncarried out: \n\n1. Prepare the textile samples, cutting a square 10x10 cm2 (or sized enough to cover all the \n\npatch of the antenna) from the selvedge of the fabric and numerating its sides clockwise, \n\nas shown on Figure 4-4;  \n\n2. Calibrate the VNA in the frequency range of interest by using the electronic calibration \n\nmodule; \n\n3. Connect the microstrip patch antenna to the VNA; \n\n4. Measure the S11 parameter of the antenna;  \n\n5. Save the data; \n\n6. Put the textile sample on the resonator board and mark the board in order to place future \n\nsamples in the exact same place;  \n\n7. Measure again the S11 parameter of the antenna, this time with the textile sample on the \n\npatch; \n\n8. Save the data; \n\n9. Repeat the previous steps (6, 7 and 8) four times by positioning the substrate sample such \n\nthat each time one different side is aligned with the microstrip feed of the antenna. Then, \n\nrepeat the complete procedure by turning the sample upside-down. As a result, a total \n\nnumber of 8 measurements is acquired (2 faces x 4 positions); \n\n10. Finally, by leveraging full-wave simulations of the antenna, extract the ?r and tan? of the \n\nmaterial under test by fitting the measured shift (fr1 \u2013 fr2) in the antenna\u2019s resonance \n\nfrequency and the measured variation in the Q-factor to the simulates ones, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-4 Scheme to cut and prepare the textile samples \n\nThe most advantageous feature of this experimental method is that it does not require \n\nsophisticated equipment, so it is fast and simple to apply. Moreover, in contrast to some of the \n\naforementioned techniques, this method is non-destructive. As such, the MUT is not modified \n\nduring the characterization process, thus yielding values of the permittivity and loss tangent \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nthat are not influenced by the glue, the conductive material or the manufacturing of the \n\nmeasured structures. \n\n4.1.2  Results \n\nIn order to study general relationships between the structure and the dielectric properties, \n\neleven fabrics which vary in terms of composition, porosity and structure were analysed. More \n\nspecifically, two samples of each material were characterized according to the procedure \n\noutlined in 4.1.1. All these fabrics are deliberately composed of synthetic fibres, aiming a low \n\ninteraction with moisture, minimizing its effect on the electromagnetic performance of the \n\nmaterials. Table 4-2 presents the structural features of the studied fabrics.  \n\nThe thickness of the samples was measured using the KES-F \u2013 3 Compressional Tester of \n\nKawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics, presented on Figure 4-5, under controlled \n\nenvironment conditions of 25\u00baC and 65% of RH, on Department of Textile Science and \n\nTechnology (DCTT) at Universidade da Beira Interior. In this method the specimen is compressed \n\nby two circular-plates of steel having 2 cm2 area. The velocity of the compression is 50 sec/mm \n\nand when the pressure attains 50 g/cm2, the recovery process proceeds at the same velocity \n\n[35]. \n\n \nFigure 4-5 KES-F - 3 Compressional Tester of Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Textiles (Laboratory of \n\nPhysical Tests \u2013 DCTT, UBI) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nTable 4-2 Characterized materials using the Resonator-Based Experimental Technique \n\nSample Manufacturer \nManufacturer \n\nreference \nComposition \n\nThickness \n(mm) \n\n3D fabric I \n\nLMA - Leandro Manuel Ara\u00fajo \nLtda. \n\n(Matosinhos, Portugal) \n\n3003 \n\n100% Polyester \n\n2.650 \n\n3D fabric II 3013 3.068 \n\n3D fabric III 3037 2.821 \n\n3D fabric IV 3006 2.410 \n\n3D fabric V 3015 4.140 \n\nCordura I B.

Figure 4-6 presents the extracted dielectric \n\nconstants obtained by positioning the sample with each of the two faces contacting the board. \n\nWe notice that the permittivity values vary according to the position of the sample on the \n\npatch. In particular, the largest variation is observed for the coated textiles. Even though the \n\npresence of this air gap can be accounted for during the characterization process, it is \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nimportant to analyse the superficial properties of the material in order to understand whether \n\nthe results are correct and the material is compatible with this kind of characterization \n\nmethod.  \n\n \nFigure 4-6 Results of the dielectric constant of textile materials when positioning face- and reverse-\n\nsides in contact with the resonator board \n\n4.2 Surface Characterization Method  \nThe influence of the surface parameters, such as superficial roughness and porosity, on the \n\ndielectric behaviour of the textiles have never been studied. Due to the results presented on \n\nFigure 4-6, detailed investigation of the influence of the surface parameters of the \n\ncharacterized textile was performed on this Subsection, in order to understand how these \n\nparameters can affect the performance of textile antennas. \n\n4.2.1  Surface Roughness \n\nThe surfaces of the textile materials were characterized by measuring the superficial geometric \n\nroughness (SMD) with KES-F \u2013 4 Surface Tester of Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics, see \n\nFigure 4-7. The SMD is measured by pulling a U-shaped steel wire with 0.5 mm diameter through \n\nthe fabric length under a normal force of 10 gf. In this way, a height profile of the fabric along \n\nits length is obtained. The standard mean deviation of this height profile is considered as \n\nsurface roughness and is called geometric roughness [35]. This test was carried out in both the \n\nwarp and the weft directions (5 measurements per each direction), for both face- and reverse-\n\nsides of the sample (20 measurements in total). The average value of these measurements is \n\npresented on Table 4-4. All measurements were performed under controlled environment \n\nconditions of 25\u00baC and 65% of relative humidity, on DCTT at Universidade da Beira Interior.   \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n \nFigure 4-7 KES-F \u2013 4 Surface Tester of Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics Laboratory of Physical \n\nTests \u2013 DCTT, UBI) \n\n4.2.2  Superficial Porosity \n\nThe superficial porosity (\u00d8sup) was measured through image analysis using the DiameterJ tool \n\n[101], of the ImageJ software image analyser [102]. To obtain the superficial pores data, the \n\nfirst step was to take pictures of the textiles\u2019 surface, in a random area, with an optical \n\nmicroscope Nikon Eclipse LV1005. The images were taken using lenses of 5X magnitude for the \n\n3D fabrics and 12X magnitude for the Neoprene, Cordura\u00ae and Fake Leather fabrics. The same \n\namount of contrast and brightness was used in all pictures.  \n\nUsing ImageJ software all images were converted to 8-bit greyscale level images. Then, the \n\nimages were segmented in a binary image6 using algorithms and thresholding tools of \n\nDiameterJ. In this method, the fibre components were converted into white colour and the \n\npores became black.  \n\nAfter the segmentation process, some white pixels could still remain in the pores areas. In this \n\ncase, the morphological noise was removed using the binary commands \u2013 erode and dilate - of \n\nthe ImageJ. The images were thus refined, eliminating the isolated pixel areas and highlighting \n\nthe fibre edges.     \n\nThereafter, the segmented image was analysed through the DiameterJ tool which gives the \n\npercentage of porosity as the ratio of the total number of black pixels to the total pixels in the \n\nimage. The DiameterJ also gives the total number of pores found in the image. Figure 4-8 \n\nillustrates the image analysis process, and the obtained results are shown on Table 4-4. \n\n                                                   \n5 Optical microscope images made at Printed Electronics Lab of EURECAT Technologic Centre (Matar\u00f3, \nSpain). \n\n6 The segmentation process mean convert to binary formats with the pixel intensity values of 0 and 1, \nthat is the image will only have black and white pixels, using the thresholding techniques. \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n \nFigure 4-8 Process of the image analysis \n\n4.2.3  Results \n\nTable 4-4 presents the results obtained: the extracted dielectric constants, ?3\t\\* and ?3\t\\+; the \n\naverage of superficial roughness measurements, SMD\\*and SMD\\+; the images used to extract \n\nthe porosity and their respective results.   \n\nTable 4-4 Results of surface characterization \n\nSample \n\nFace- side Reverse- side \n\n??\t??\t \nSuperficial \nporosity  \n(% / cm2) \n\nNumber of \npores / cm2 \n\n?????\t \n(\u00b5m) \n\nSurface image ??\t??\t \nSuperficial \nporosity  \n(% / cm2) \n\nNumber of \npores / cm2 \n\n????? \n(\u00b5m) \n\nSurface image \n\n3D fabric \n I \n\n1.12 35.43 89 5.320 \n\n \n\n1.08 17.96 244 9.130 \n\n \n\n3D fabric  \nII \n\n1.11 23.45 126 4.988 \n\n \n\n1.08 21.07 269 10.700 \n\n \n\n3D fabric \nIII \n\n1.11 18.90 219 5.743 \n\n \n\n1.12 22.71 165 2.578 \n\n \n\n3D fabric \nIV \n\n1.13 35.40 180 3.523 \n\n \n\n1.13 32.02 144 3.140 \n\n \n\n3D fabric  \nV \n\n1.12 17.28 129 7.723 \n\n \n\n1.11 25.41 242 7.865 \n\n \n\nCordura  \nI \n\n1.64 0.5&lt;1 2.755 \n\n \n\n1.53 2 1 3.130 \n\n \n\nCordura  \nII \n\n1.59 0.7&lt;1 2.353 \n\n \n\n1.54 1.8 1 3.770 \n\n \n\nNeoprene  \nI \n\n1.37 10.71 5 3.440 \n\n \n\n1.36 11.05 16 3.795 \n\n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nSample \n\nFace- side Reverse- side \n\n??\t??\t \nSuperficial \nporosity  \n(% / cm2) \n\nNumber of \npores / cm2 \n\n?????\t \n(\u00b5m) \n\nSurface image ??\t??\t \nSuperficial \nporosity  \n(% / cm2) \n\nNumber of \npores / cm2 \n\n????? \n(\u00b5m) \n\nSurface image \n\nNeoprene \nII \n\n1.27 11.28 14 2.403 \n\n \n\n1.33 7.13 7 2.258 \n\n \n\nFake \nLeather I \n\n1.66 1&lt;1 1.430 \n\n \n\n1.24 21.19 20 2.985 \n\n \n\nFake \nLeather II \n\n1.64 1&lt;1 1.985 \n\n \n\n1.22 22.3 21 3.383 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown on Table 4-4, the surface features of the MUT may significantly influence the results \n\nobtained with the resonator-based experimental technique of dielectric characterization. \n\nAnalysing the ?r values on Table 4-4, one may verify that the dielectric constant extracted when \n\nplacing the rougher face turning down contacting the resonator board presents a lower value. \n\nThis is observed for all samples. Indeed, when positioning the rougher face in contact with the \n\nboard more air is trapped on the interface between the MUT and the resonator board, lowering \n\nthe measured value of ?r.  \n\nSeveral structural parameters, such as stitch density and loop length, can influence the \n\ndifferences on the roughness of face and reverse sides of the textile materials. These features \n\nmay be represented by the superficial roughness and porosity. Also, as one may observe on \n\nTable 4-4, the faces that have higher roughness SMD also have the higher number of superficial \n\npores per cm2. This fact corroborates that, as expected, a higher number of superficial pores \n\nis related to a higher value of the surface roughness. Accordingly, positioning the faces with \n\nhigher number of pores in contact with the board lowers the measured permittivity values. \n\nConsidering all 176 ?r measurements (8 measurements per probe, 2 probes per material and 11 \n\nmaterials) and plotting these data against the number of superficial pores per cm2 of each face \n\nof the materials, an logarithmical regression is found, with R2 = 0.97574, as shown on Figure \n\n4-9.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 49 \n\n \nFigure 4-9 Relative dielectric constant vs Pores per cm2 (logarithmical regression) \n\nThis means the dielectric constant value exponentially decreases with the increase of number \n\nof pores per cm2, due to the presence of the air on the textile surface. Furthermore, the \n\nrelative difference, ?, of ?r and \u00d8sup among faces of the textile was calculated by (4-3), \n\nexpressed in %: \n\n?\t=\t(jklO\t*)jklO\t+)\njklO\t+\n\n? 100                                                     (4-3) \n\nwhere: side 1 is the face with higher value and side 2 is the face with lower value. \n\nThe results are plotted on Figure 4-10. A linear regression describes very well the relationship \n\nbetween the relative differences of ?r and \u00d8sup, with R\n2 = 0.99146 as shown on Figure 4-10. \n\n \nFigure 4-10 Relative difference of dielectric constant vs relative difference of superficial porosity \n\n(linear regression) \n\nAs presented on Figure 4-10, the largest relative difference between the ?r of the face- and of \n\nthe reverse-sides is observed for the coated textiles (Fake Leather I \u2013 33.87 % and II \u2013 34.42%). \n\nThe 3D fabrics IV and II presented the lowest relative difference (0% and 2.78%, respectively). \n\nCoherently, these textiles also present the largest (Fake Leather I \u2013 2019% and II \u2013 2130%) and \n\nlowest (3D fabric IV \u2013 10.56% and II \u2013 11.30%) difference of superficial porosity among faces.  \n\n\n\n 50 \n\n4.3 Structural Parameters Characterization \n\n4.3.1  Bulk Porosity \n\nThe bulk porosity (\u00d8) of the textiles was calculated by (4-4). \n\n? = 1 ?\t o\nop\n\n                                                     (4-4) \n\nWhere: ?

The \n\nresults of the calculated bulk porosity of textiles are shown on Table 4-5. \n\nTable 4-5 Results of bulk porosity  \n\nSample Density of polymeric components (kg/m3) Density (kg/m3) Porosity (%) \n3D fabric I PES = 1380 98.113 92.89 \n3D fabric II PES = 1380 114.080 91.73 \n3D fabric III PES = 1380 103.509 92.50 \n\n3D fabric IV PES = 1380 136.514 90.11 \n3D fabric V PES = 1380 87.198 93.68 \nCordura I PA 6.6 = 1120 | PTFE = 2200 449.304 59.91 \nCordura II PA 6.6 = 1120 | PU = 1150 469.061 58.91 \n\nNeoprene I Neoprene = 1060 | PES = 1380 224.80 79.98 \nNeoprene II Neoprene = 1060 | PES = 1380 | PA = 1130 222.294 80.31 \n\nFake Leather I PES = 1380 | PU = 1150 492.178 63.53 \nFake Leather II PES = 1380 | PU = 1150 446.370 67.00 \n\n \n\nThe results of bulk porosity also were analysed Plotting the 176 ?r measurements against the \n\nbulk porosity results, a linear regression describes well the relationship between ?r and \u00d8, with \n\nR2 = 0.97169 as shown on Figure 4-11.   \n\n \nFigure 4-11 Relative dielectric constant vs bulk porosity (linear regression) \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nThis is an expected result, as higher values of bulk porosity mean higher percentage of air into \n\nthe fabric structure, lowering the dielectric constant of the fabric as air presents ?r ?1.  \n\n4.4 Significance of the Dielectric Results on the Design \nof Microstrip Patch Antennas  \n\nIn order to analyse the impact of the differences of the ?r values on the performance of textile \n\nantennas, six microstrip textile antennas were designed using the CST Microwave Studio 2016 \n\nfull-wave simulator. All antennas were designed to resonate at 2.25 GHz, the same frequency \n\nused on the electromagnetic characterization procedure. Indeed, if the positioning of the MUT, \n\nplacing the face or reverse-side in contact with the resonator board, leads to differences in the \n\nmeasured results of ?r, it is important to verify the significance of these differences when \n\nmanufacturing the microstrip antenna, when placing the patch in one or other face. \n\nThe antennas were manufactured using a commercial e-textile (Pure copper polyester taffeta \n\nfabric, Less EMF Inc., USA), with Rs = 0.05 ?/? and thickness equal to 0.080 mm, for the patch \nand the ground plane.  \n\nFor the dielectric substrate, six diverse fabrics were considered, chosen among the previously \n\ncharacterized ones. The antennas were designed using the ?r averaged value,\tshown on Table \n\n4-3. For each substrate, two antennas were produced placing the patch on the face and on the \n\nreverse-side, respectively, as shown on Figure 4-12. The specification of these antennas is \n\nreported on Table 4-6. \n\n \n                         (a)                                                   (b)                                                     (c) \nFigure 4-12 3D II textile antenna patch placed on (a) face side and (b) on reverse side of the fabric, and \n\n(c) rear of the antenna \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nTable 4-6 Dimensions of the textile antennas  \n\n   *Horizontal distance from the edge to the centre of the patch. \n\nTo ensure the geometric accuracy of the radiating element, a square patch was deliberated \n\ndesigned. All patches were cut with a laser cutting machine (LC6090C CCD, from Jinan G. Weike \n\nScience &amp; Technology Co. Ltd., Jinan, China), on Department of Aerospace Science at \n\nUniversidade da Beira Interior. The prototypes were produced by assembling the components \n\nwith a thermal adhesive sheet I, and feed by SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance. After the \n\nconstruction, all prototypes were tested measuring the S11, between 2 and 3 GHz, using a VNA, \n\nat Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro.

Looking at the results of prototype 2, despite the small shift on the bandwidth, both \n\nmeasured antennas are resonating on 2.24 GHz, showing good agreement with the simulated \n\nvalues. It is important to notice that these small shifts may be caused by the manual \n\nmanufacturing process.  \n\nPrototypes 3 and 4 have shown a larger shift on the resonant frequency. In fact, the neoprene \n\nis highly deformable and when heat was applied to assemble the conductive parts the neoprene \n\nhas shrunk, reducing the thickness of both antennas in 1.5 mm. Despite this, the prototypes 3 \n\nand 4 still present an acceptable result, as one can see on Table 4-7, the resonate frequency \n\nstill close to the simulated one. \n\nThe prototypes 5 and 6, whose dielectric substrates are fake leather fabrics, show the biggest \n\ndifference of performances when positioning the patch in the face or reverse - side of the \n\nsubstrate. The resonant frequency of the prototypes whose patch was placed on the face-side, \n\nthe less rough one, was shifted to a lower frequency (2.17 \u2013 2.23  and 2.20 \u2013 2.26 , respectively \n\nfor antennas 5 and 6), proving that the substrate positioned this way presents a higher ?r then \n\nthe values considered on simulation, as expected. Similarly, in prototypes whose patch was \n\nplaced in the reverse-side, the roughest one, the S11 was shifted to a higher frequency (2.23 \u2013 \n\n2.28 and 2.27 \u2013 2.33 GHz, respectively for antennas 5 and 6), that the substrate positioned this \n\nway has a lower ?r than the value used on the simulation process. This is explained by the fact \n\nthe bandwidth of the microstrip patch antenna is inversely proportional to the square root of \n\nthe dielectric constant of the substrate [8], [32] .  \n\nIn summary, prototypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, present a quite similar behaviour when placing the patch \n\non the face or reverse- sides of the substrate. Indeed, as previously shown on Figure 4-6, the \n\n3D and the neoprene fabrics used as substrate in these prototypes present low differences of \n\nthe measured values of ?r when placing the face or reverse-sides in contact to the resonator-\n\nboard (less than 4.6%). On the contrary, prototypes 5 and 6 show different performance when \n\nplacing the patch in one or other faces of the substrate as expected considering the higher \n\n\n\n 54 \n\ndifference of values of ?r (around 34%) measured placing the substrate in one and other \n\npositions, as previously presented on Figure 4-6. Despite these differences, prototypes 5 and 6 \n\nperform reasonably well, as the resonant frequency is close to the simulated one, as presented \n\non Table 4-7.  \n\nTherefore, one may conclude that, despite the observed differences in results obtained for \n\ndifferent positioning of the dielectric substrate, the average value of ?r characterizes well the \n\nmaterial and ensures a reliable performance of the textile antennas. Thus, the average value \n\nof ?r measured by the resonator-based experimental technique is suitable to be considered for \n\nthe design of microstrip patch antennas. \n\nAs one can see on Table 4-7, for all tested prototypes the measured resonance frequency was \n\nquite close to the simulated one. For samples presenting even larger structural differences \n\nbetween faces, the precision of the resonant frequency might be improved by adjusting the \n\ndielectric constant value by adding or subtracting the standard deviation value. Therefore, if \n\nthe patch is placed over the roughest face, the ?r is adjusted by subtracting the standard \n\ndeviation to the measured averaged value of ?r; and the other way around. \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nThe new Resonator-Based Experimental Technique was introduced to characterise several \n\ntextile fabrics of interest. This method is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation, which \n\nconsists in computing the electromagnetic parameters of the material under test, at a single \n\nfrequency (2.25 GHz), by measuring the shift in the resonance frequency and in the value of \n\nthe Q-factor of a microstrip patch antenna.  \n\nIn general, the resonant methods yield higher accuracy than non-resonant ones and do not \n\nrequire complex sample preparation. Another advantage of the method is that it is only applied \n\nto the antenna substrate. Therefore, the procedure is not affected by arbitrary effects, such \n\nas, for example, the type of glue/adhesive sheet, the connector and the manufacturing \n\ntechnique of the probe, which can lead to the non-repeatability of the measurements and \n\nintroduce variations in the final values.  \n\nThe air-fibre mixture content on fabrics leads to a heterogeneous characterization process. In \n\nthis work the studied materials showing higher bulk porosity also show lower dielectric constant \n\nvalues, which is due to the higher amount of air inside the fabric structure. The presented \n\nresults corroborate that roughness correlates well with the number of pores on the surface: the \n\ntextiles that present higher number of pores on the surface, also show higher SMD values. \n\nFurthermore, when characterizing fabrics with the resonator-based experimental technique, \n\nplacing the faces of higher SMD in contact with the resonator board results in  lower values of \n\n?r. Also, it is reported that the ?r exponentially decreases with the superficial porosity increase. \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nBoth of these facts occur because of the presence of the air on the surface, trapped in the \n\nsuperficial pores.   \n\nBesides the measured values of the dielectric constant differ when placing the face or reverse-\n\nsides in contact to the resonator board, and are thus influenced by the structure of the surface \n\nof the fabrics, this does not seem not be significant for the development of textile antennas. \n\nWhen designing microstrip patch antennas, the average of ?r is well suited to ensure a reliable \n\nperformance of the antenna.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 56 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 57 \n\n5  Chapter \n\n \n\nTextile Antenna for RF Energy Harvesting \n\n \n\nThe content of this chapter was partially published on IEEE International Symposium on \n\nAntennas and Propagation (2013), 24th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Personal, \n\nIndoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (2013), 7th International Symposium on Medical \n\nInformation and Communication Technology (2014), 21th International Conference on \n\nTelecommunications (2104) and 5th STS Italia Conference?A Matter of Design: Making Society \n\nthrough Science and Technology. The paper presented in this last conference was chosen as \n\none of the ten best papers by young researchers and was awarded with a grant.  \n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) scenario is strongly related with the advance of the development \n\nof Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems. \n\nAdditionally, in the WBSN context, the integration of textile antennas for energy harvesting \n\ninto smart clothing is a particularly interesting solution for a continuous wirelessly feed. \n\nIndeed, in the context of wearable devices the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice. \n\nThis chapter describes the concept of the energy harvesting and presents a survey of textile \n\nantennas for RF energy harvesting. A dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for \n\nelectromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, is also proposed. \n\nThe presented printed monopole antenna was developed in the framework of the PROENERGY \n\nPROJECT - Prototypes for Efficient Energy Self-Sustainable Wireless Sensor Networks, \n\nreference PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. The antenna aims to harvest energy to feed sensor \n\nnodes of a wearable health monitoring system. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi \n\nand 2.06 dBi allied with a radiation efficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest \n\nfrequency bands, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n Nowadays, the socio-economic development and lifestyle trends indicate an increasing \n\nconsumption of technological products and processes. The IoT scenario boosts the concept of \n\nwearable systems, as for instance health-monitoring systems ones [4], [103], [104]. The \n\ndevelopment of smart objects for IoT applications, include the capacity of identification of \n\nthese objects in order to communicate and to interact with [4].  \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nIn this context, wearable technology has been addressed to make the person, mainly through \n\nhis clothes, able to communicate with, and be part of, this technological network [105]. For \n\ninstance, the wearable health-monitoring systems are not only endowed with sensing, \n\nprocessing, actuation and communication abilities, but also with energy harvesting and storage \n\napplications, emerging as a solution to the challenges of ubiquitous monitoring of people in \n\nseveral contexts.  \n\nThe integration of WBSN on clothing puts the question about how to feed them. The batteries \n\nare an obvious choice, but they are bulky, require frequent replacement or recharging, and \n\ntheir short longevity is an ecological concern of current times. In this framework, the need for \n\nbattery-free systems is increasing dramatically. Therefore, textile antennas for energy \n\nharvesting, emerge as a particularly interesting solution when the replacement of batteries is \n\nnot easy to practice, such as in embedded systems.  \n\nEnergy harvesting, or power scavenging, is the process of extracting energy from the surround \n\nenvironment and converting it into consumable electrical energy [106]. There are several \n\nsources of energy that can be harvested, such as acoustic, wind, solar, wave, mechanical and \n\nthermal.  \n\nNowadays, RF energy is currently broadcasted from billions of radio transmitters and, thus, can \n\nbe collected from the ambient environment or from dedicated sources [107]. Additionally, RF \n\ntransmitters and receivers can be used when other potential intermittent energy scavenging \n\nsources (e.g., vibration and heat) are not available.  \n\nThese radio waves present a widely available source of energy if effectively and efficiently \n\nharvested. Therefore, electromagnetic energy harvesting (EEH) holds a promising future for \n\npower supply of wearable low-power devices, offering a unique solution, enable for the \n\nimplementation of a battery-free wireless sensing solution for 24 hours.  \n\nAccording to [108], there are two basic approaches, that will depend on the environmental \n\ncondition, to harvest the electromagnetic energy: \n\n1. Ambient source: in this approach, the harvester system uses the electromagnetic waves \n\nalready present in the environment, such as solar [65], artificial light [109], or both [110], \n\n[111]. Also, can use the random RF sources, prevenient from telecommunication systems, \n\nlike Wi-Fi hotspots [112] and cell phone signals [113], [114], available specially in highly \n\npopulate areas.  \n\n2. Dedicated source: in this approach, the harvester system is designed for a known RF source. \n\nThis method can be more advantageous due to the previous knowledge about the RF source, \n\nthat includes the frequency, directionality and polarization, as occur in the case of Wireless \n\nPower Transmission (WPT) [115]. \n\nThis means, whereas in EEH the concept is harvesting the electromagnetic waves from the air, \n\nin WPT the electromagnetic beams are clearly directed in the direction of the device to power \n\nup, both of them working on far-field region [116]. \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nNevertheless, in the WPT context, there are other methods of transmitting energy wirelessly, \n\nworking on near-field region, such as inductive coupling and magnetic resonance coupling [115], \n\n[117]. Also, it is possible to combine energy harvesting with wireless power transmission \n\ntechniques, as presented in [108], [116]. This PhD Thesis will only focus on the electromagnetic \n\nenergy harvesting, working on far-field region. The application, the range and field region from \n\neach wireless power transmission technique are described on Table 5-1. \n\nTable 5-1 Wireless energy transfer techniques and applications \n\nWireless energy \ntransfer technique \n\nRF power transmission \nMagnetic resonance \n\ncoupling \nResonant inductive \n\ncoupling \n\nRange \n\nLong \u2013 normally from several \nmeters to kilometres (depend \n\non the frequency and efficiency \nof the RF energy harvester) \n\nMedium \u2013 from few \ncentimetres to meters \n\nShort \u2013 from few \nmillimetres to \ncentimetres \n\nField region Far-field Near-field Near-field \n\nApplications \nCommunication, sensor and \npowering \u2013 WSN and WBAN \n\nPowering - cell phone \ncharging, Plug-in \n\nHybrid Electric Vehicle \n(PHEV) charging \n\nCommunication - \nPassive RFID tags, cell \n\nphone charging \n\n \n\n \n\nConsidering the recent advances in the wireless energy transfer technologies, not limited to \n\nthe WSN and WBAN, in the near future, smart cities will be fully covered by small stations of \n\ndedicated sources, to wirelessly power wearable devices, such as augmented reality glasses \n\nand wellness devices [118]. \n\n5.2 Review of Textile Antennas for RF Energy Harvesting \n\nThe state-of-art of textile antennas for RF energy harvesting was based in search criteria that \n\nincluded 6 combinations of index terms, presented on Table 5-2, inquiring three main \n\ndatabases:  \n\n1.

Further, the search was limited to journal, conference and \n\nreview papers, available until May of 2017. The search was generating 61, 43 and 71 results on \n\nScopus\u00ae, ISI\u00ae and IEEE Xplore\u00ae, respectively. After excluding the papers that use rigid antennas \n\nor rigid materials, and eliminating the repeated works, a group of 20 papers remained. In this \n\ngroup, only papers using textile materials for both, conductive and dielectric parts and used \n\nfor far-field RF energy harvesting were considered. In the following section, 12 works will be \n\nbriefly described.  The others 8 papers are related to the work developed in the framework of \n\nPROENERGY PROJECT - Prototypes for Efficient Energy Self-Sustainable Wireless Sensor \n\nNetworks, reference PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010.

As explained in [135], the \n\nantenna performs the transduction of the RF energy into an electrical AC signal. A matching \n\nnetwork is used to transfer a maximum AC power to the rectifier. Then, the rectifier converts \n\nthe AC signal into a DC voltage, charging a load. In 2010, [130] Constanzo et al. presented the \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nfirst scheme of a triple-band ring textile rectenna for RF energy harvesting, operating at GSM \n\n900, GSM 1800, and Wi-Fi frequencies.  \n\nThis antenna was developed with a multilayer configuration and for its conductive parts the \n\nGlobal EMC shielding fabric with sheet resistance of 0.02 ?/? was used. An unspecified fabric \n\nwith ?r = 1.23 was used as a substrate support of the antenna. The Kapton\n\u00ae fabric with ?r = 3.4, \n\ntan? = 0.002 and 1 mm of thickness, was used as the dielectric substrate. The predicted antenna \n\nefficiencies of this antenna are 61% at 900 MHz, 54% at 1.750 MHz, and 85% at 2.450 MHz. The \n\nintegration of this triple-band ring textile rectenna, in a fully-autonomous RF energy \n\nharvesting, was further presented in [122], [124]. Later, the authors present the first scheme \n\nof a jacket, integrating this antenna into a harvester circuit  [113], [125], [129]. \n\nIn 2013, a circular patch slotted textile antenna was proposed for RF energy harvesting, \n\noperating at 2.45 GHz [100]. A denim fabric, with 1.6 mm of thickness, ?r = 1.7 and                    \n\ntan? = 0.085, was used as dielectric substrate. This study investigated the performance of the \n\nantenna under bending conditions. The authors observed that when the antenna have small \n\nbending radius, major changes on the gain and radiation pattern of the antenna will occur. For \n\nexample, in the normal state (no bending applied) the antenna shows a gain of 7.34 dBi, while \n\nunder bending conditions (R = 20mm), the maximum gain obtained was 7.10 dBi. \n\nLater, in 2014, Tallos et al. presented the draft of a coat with multiple body-worn embroidered \n\ntextile antennas, to be integrated into a harvester system operating in the 2.45 GHz WLAN band \n\n[112]. This study has shown that body-worn textile antennas with rectifying circuits can supply \n\nenough power to feed low-power sensors. \n\nIn 2015, Adami et al. presented a textile patch antenna and a rectenna for 2.45 GHz RF power \n\ntransfer and harvesting, to feed low-power sensors on clothing [79]. In both cases, a fabric \n\ncomposed of polyester abd cotton (35% PES 65% CO) was used as dielectric substrate, having    \n\n?r = 3.23 and tan? = 0.06. For the conductive parts, silver ink \u2013 Dupont 500 was applied, through \n\nthe screen printing technique. Both, patch antenna and rectenna, were replicated using RF-4 \n\nas dielectric substrate, in order to compare the efficiency.  \n\nThe textile patch antenna showed 11% of radiation efficiency against 30% efficiency of antenna \n\nmade of RF-4. The authors indicate that the difference on the radiation efficiency is correlated \n\nto the dielectric losses of the substrates, as the fabric presents tan? = 0.06 and RF-4 presents \n\ntan? = 0.0175. Furthermore, the rectennas were tested varying the power source. For the \n\nhighest power source used, the textile rectenna was capable to generates 100 \u00b5W. In \n\ncomparison, the RF-4 rectenna generated 230 \u00b5W, being this difference coherent with the \n\ndiscrepancy in the radiation efficiency previously measured.   \n\nIn 2016, a broadband spiral textile rectenna was presented and integrated on a RF energy \n\nharvesting system [119]. The designed system operates over a frequency range from 0.9 GHz \n\nto 4 GHz. In order to improve results, four different combinations of materials for the dielectric \n\nsubstrate and conductive parts, were proposed: (A) felt (?r = 1.14 and h = 5 mm) and Shieldit \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nSuper\u00ae (? = 1.96x105 S/m), (B) fleece (?r = 1.17 and h = 3 mm) and Shieldit Super\n\u00ae (? = 1.96x105 \n\nS/m), (C) felt (?r = 1.14 and h = 5 mm) and stainless steel conductive yarns (? = 3.88x10\n4 S/m). \n\nAlso, a rigid antenna (C) FR-4 (?r = 4.3 and h = 1.5 mm) and copper (? = 5.96x10\n7 S/m), was \n\nmade in order be the reference antenna to which compare the efficiency of the textile ones. \n\nAll antennas worked well, resonating at frequencies very close to the simulated ones. Moreover, \n\nantenna A shows the best result. Antenna B has a small shift in the resonance frequency due to \n\nthe presence of air gaps between the fleece layer, while antenna C shows the higher shift \n\nbecause the improper attachment of the conductive yarns. Also, the measurements show that \n\nthe spiral textile antenna A substrate had a higher fractional bandwidth in comparison with B. \n\nThe harvester system was tested in two different indoor and outdoor scenarios, measuring 1.5 \n\nV and 0.5 V, respectively. The efficiency of the wearable system was around 30%. \n\nRecently, in 2017, Iv\u0161i et al. have shown a spiral wideband textile antenna for RF energy \n\nharvesting, operating between 470 MHz up to 8 GHz, and a rectifier circuit to wirelessly feed \n\non-body sensors [132]. To ensure the flexibility of the antenna, aiming the integration into \n\ncloth, the spiral antenna was embroidered with conductive yarns, using a denim fabric as \n\ndielectric substrate. This antenna was capable to cover all frequency ranges of interest \u2013 digital \n\ntelevision, GSM and Wi-Fi. The measured gain was 1 dBi. \n\n5.3 Spectrum Opportunities  \n\nThe advance of technology stimulates the growing number of wireless transmitters, especially \n\nin highly populated urban areas, naturally increasing the power density of available RF in the \n\nenvironment. In order to identify the most promising frequencies for harvesting, measurements \n\nof the electromagnetic spectrum availability from 350 MHz to 3 GHz were performed, in the \n\nscope of the PROENERGY PROJECT \u2013 PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010 and as reported in [121], \n\n[123].  \n\nThe field trials were performed using the NARDA- SMR spectrum analyser with measuring \n\nantenna, and the Signal Hound spectrum analyser. By analysing the power density \n\nmeasurements in 40 different indoor/outdoor locations in Covilh\u00e3 and Lisbon, was possible to \n\nidentify the best opportunities that may be considered to conceive wideband or multiband \n\nantennas for electromagnetic energy harvesting. Figure 5-1 presents the locations of the  \n\nmeasurements performed in Covilh\u00e3, and the average result of all measurements results is \n\ndepicted on Figure 5-2. \n\n\n\n 63 \n\n  \nFigure 5-1 Measurements locations in Covilh\u00e3 \n\n \nFigure 5-2 Average received power for all measurements \n\nObserving the Figure 5-2, the sets of frequency bands with more available energy are:  \n\n\u2022 390 to 392 MHz \u2013 Emergency broadcast stations; \n\n\u2022 750 to 759 MHz \u2013 Television broadcast stations;? \n\n\u2022 934 to 960 MHz \u2013 GSM 900; \n\n\u2022 1.763 to 1.773 MHz \u2013 GSM 1800; \n\n\u2022 1.854 to 1.892 MHz \u2013 GSM 1800; \n\n\u2022 2.115 to 2.160 MHz \u2013 Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS); \n\n\u2022 2.359 MHz \u2013 Amateur, Services Ancillary to Broadcast / Services Ancillary to Programme \n\n(SAP/SAB) applications;  \n\n\u2022 2.404 to 2.468 MHz \u2013 Wi-Fi. \n\n\n\n 64 \n\n5.4 Printed Monopole Textile Antenna \n\nBased on the previous analysis, it is possible to conclude that the best set of frequency bands \n\nfor energy harvesting is the mobile phone bands. Therefore, a dual-band printed monopole \n\ntextile antenna to harvest in the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands was proposed.  \n\nThe simulation of this antenna was made using CST Microwave Studio, using textile materials \n\ncommercially available. For the dielectric substrate, a synthetic fabric (100% high tenacity PA \n\n6.6), Cordura\u00ae (B. W. Wernerfelt Group, S\u00f8borg, Danmark), was chosen, as it is geometrically \n\nstable, presenting very low mechanical deformation. It also has low regain and minimizes the \n\neffect of the moisture absorption on lowering the resonance frequency of the antenna [128]. \n\nFor the conductive parts, Zelt\u00ae (Less EMF Inc., Latham, USA) was considered. Table 5-3 \n\ndescribes the properties of the used textile materials.  \n\nTable 5-3 Textile materials used in the development of printed monopole \n\nDielectric Material \n\nFabric \nMass per unit \nsurface (g/m2) \n\nComposition Finishing \nThickness \n\n(mm) ?r \ntan? \n\nCordura\u00ae 280 100% PA 6.6 Polyurethane coated 0.5 1.9 0.0098 \nConductive Material \n\nFabric \nMass per unit \nsurface (g/m2) \n\nComposition Finishing \nThickness \n\n(mm) \nConductivity \n\n(S/m) \n\nZelt\u00ae 55.87 100% PA Copper and tin plated 0.06 1.75105 \n\nThe proposed design of the antenna is presented on Figure 5-3 and its dimensions are given on \n\nTable 5-4.

An \n\nomnidirectional radiation, was chosen as the privileged direction of signal reception is \n\nunknown. The obtained gain, from numerical simulation, for the dual band antenna, is about \n\n1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with 82% and 77.6% radiation efficiencies for the GSM 900 and DCS \n\n1800 frequency bands, respectively.  \n\nFurther, the printed monopole textile antenna was produced assembling the components with \n\na thermal adhesive sheet (Fixorete Losango, JAU T\u00eaxteis, Serzedo, Portugal). Figure 5-3 shows \n\nthe textile antenna after assemblage. The antenna is fed by a SMA connector, with 50 ? of \n\nimpedance. The return loss, presented in Figure 5-6, was measured using VNA at Instituto de \n\nTelecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro. \n\n\n\n 66 \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n                                                   (a)                                                    (b) \nFigure 5-5 Dual-band printed monopole after assembly (a) front (b) rear \n\n \n\nFigure 5-6 Simulated and measured S11 of the dual-band printed monopole \n\nOne may observe that this textile antenna presents an operating frequency range capable of \n\ncompletely covering the GSM 900 (880-960 MHz) and the DCS 1800 (1710-1880 MHz). Also, \n\nobserving the S11 on Figure 5-6 some small differences between the simulated and the measured \n\nvalues are expected due to imprecisions related with the manual manufacturing process.  \n\nAs presented on Subsection 5.1, it is possible to harvest RF electromagnetic energy from \n\nmultiple sources. References [121], [126], [131] presents the fully integration of this printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna in a harvester system. In summary, a five-stage Dickson voltage \n\nmultiplier enables perpetual operation of an IRIS mote by a received RF power larger than 1 \n\ndBm. In addition, a TX91501 Powercast\u00ae RF transmitter was applied as dedicated source, \n\nproviding a predictable and reliable RF energy power source to wirelessly charge battery-based \n\n\n\n 67 \n\nsystems. With this system it was possible to charge sensor nodes up to 3 meters from the \n\ndedicated source. Figure 5-7 shows the printed monopole textile antenna connected to the 5-\n\nstage Dickson during the tests. This PhD Thesis is focussed on the development of textile \n\nantennas, but more information about the integration of this antenna on the harvester system \n\nand on power supply of sensors nodes for health monitoring can ne found in references reporting \n\ncomplementary work made on the scope of PROENERGY PROJECT [121], [126], [131]. \n\n \nFigure 5-7 Printed monopole textile antenna connected to a 5-stage Dickson voltage multiplier \n\n5.5 Conclusions \nThe advance of wearable technology and the miniaturization of the electronic devices are \n\nboosting the development of smart garments, for instance able to provide information about \n\nthe state of user\u2019s health and environment.  \n\nEnergy harvesting can be a solution for powering battery-free devices. This technology is \n\nconsidered essential for the industry in several areas of expertise, including medical, consumer \n\nelectronics, fashion, automotive, and industrial control process. In the context of wearable \n\nsystems, textile antennas are emerging as the solution for feeding low-power devices and/or \n\nWireless Sensors Body Networks, where the change of batteries is not easy to perform. \n\nBesides, the electromagnetic energy harvesting and the wireless power transmission are trendy \n\nresearch topics. A wearable systems using textile antennas is a very new subject, having \n\nemerged only in the past decade. For this reason, the state-of-the-art of textile antennas for \n\nRF energy harvesting is short. Also, the usage of electronic devices increases the availability of \n\nRF sources on the environment. Indeed, after field trials at Covilh\u00e3 and Lisbon, two different \n\ncities in Portugal, the most available frequencies to harvest are from the emergency and \n\ntelevision broadcasts, Amateur and GSM bands.  \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nThis Chapter has also presented a dual-band printed monopole textile antenna which was tested \n\non the scope of the PROENERGY PROJECT \u2013 PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. It can be able to \n\ncharge low-power devices, as well as extending the lifetime of tiny devices by using \n\nelectromagnetic energy harvested at GSM 900 and DSC 1800. The printed monopole textile \n\nantenna was made using commercially available textiles. It has shown good behaviour on stand-\n\nalone measurements. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with a \n\nradiation efficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest frequency bands, respectively. \n\nAfter its integration on the harvester system, was possible to charge the nodes of WSBN up to \n\n3 meters from the dedicated source. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n6  Chapter \n\n \n\nInfluence of the Manufacturing Techniques on the \n\nS11 Parameter of Printed Textile Antennas \n\n \n\nThe content of this Chapter was partially published on Sensors Journal (2016), 10th European \n\nConference on Antennas and Propagation (2016), Electronic Conference on Sensors Applications \n\n(2016) and IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on Advanced Materials and Process \n\n(2017). In this last conference, the paper was received an honourable mention in the student \n\npaper competition.  \n\nBeyond the selection of the textile materials to design an antenna, the process of \n\nmanufacturing the antenna is also crucial, due to the very high deformability of the materials. \n\nIn this Chapter, several techniques are tested through preliminary tests, to identify promising \n\ntechniques and to discard inefficient ones, such as the gluing technique. Then, the influence \n\nof several parameters of the manufacturing techniques on the performance of the antenna \n\nare analysed, such as the use of steam during lamination, the type of adhesive sheet, the \n\norientation of the conductive elements and others. Further, seven prototypes of the printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques. The \n\nmeasurement of sheet resistance has shown that the presence of the adhesive sheet used on \n\nthe laminating process may reduce the conductivity of the conductive materials. Despite that, \n\nwhen measuring the return loss of printed monopole antennas produced by lamination, the \n\nresults show the antennas have a good performance. The results also show that the orientation \n\nof the conductive fabric does not influence the performance of the antennas. However, when \n\ntesting embroidered antennas, the results show that the direction and number of the stitches \n\nin the embroidery may influence the performance of the antenna.  \n\n \n\n6.1 Introduction \nBeyond choosing the textile materials, the construction technique of the antenna is also crucial \n\nbecause the textile materials are highly deformable. The geometrical dimensions of the \n\nconductive patch and of the dielectric substrate should remain stable when connecting them, \n\nas the mechanical stabilization of both materials is essential to preserve the desired \n\ncharacteristics of the antenna. The geometrical precision of the conductive patch is also \n\n\n\n 70 \n\ncritical, especially when the antenna has thin details, as the one proposed in 5.4.  \n\nAs previously reviewed in Chapter 2, several techniques have been used to manufacture the \n\ntextile antennas, using commercial available materials and low-cost procedures. The next \n\nSubsections describe and analyse several manufacturing techniques, aiming to improve the \n\nperformance of the printed monopole textile antenna presented in previous Chapter 5. \n\n6.2 Preliminary Results: Miscellaneous Techniques \nIn order to select the best procedures for manufacturing textile antennas, a textile antenna \n\nwas designed to be reference and undergo preliminary tests. It is a microstrip patch antenna \n\nfor 2.45 GHz, produced using the materials described on Table 5-3. It has a rectangular shape \n\nto guarantee the mechanical stability during the tests. The antenna was designed to be fed by \n\na microstrip line, using a SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance. The design and dimensions \n\nof the microstrip patch antenna are described in Figure 6-1 and Table 6-1, respectively. \n\n \nFigure 6-1 Design of the microstip patch antenna used to test several manufacturing techniques \n\nTable 6-1 Dimensions of the microstrip patch antenna  \n\nParameter Dimensions (mm) \nW, L 80, 80 \n\nWm, Lm 41.5, 58 \nWf, Lf 19.25, 2.3 \n\nSixteen prototypes of the microstrip patch antenna were produced, as described in Table 6-2, \n\nusing four manufacturing techniques: laminating, sewing, gluing and coating. Through the \n\nlaminating technique, three adhesive sheets were tested, varying in terms of porosity, \n\nthickness and composition. Images of two of these thermal adhesive sheets are shown below in \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nTable 6.4. The glued antennas were produced using three different glues available on the \n\nmarket, being one specific for textiles. Considering the high risk of short cuts between the \n\npatch and the ground plane, as reported on 2.2, one sewed antenna was made, sewing with \n\nnon-conductive thread. Also, two antennas were fabricated through the coating process. In one \n\nof them, the prototype 14, the assembly is completely wrapped by the coat eliminating the \n\nmaterial interface between the substrate and the conductive parts. Table 6-2 describes the \n\nprototypes and the materials used on the assembly process. \n\nTable 6-2 Description of the manufacturing techniques used to produce the microstrip patch antennas \n\nManufacturing \ntechnique \n\nPrototype Description of assembly process Material Schema \n\nLaminating \ntechnique \n\n1 \nAdhesive sheet only on the edges of \nthe conductive parts, applied by the \n\nironing operation. \n\nFixorete \nCont\u00ednuo (JAU \n\nT\u00eaxteis, \nPortugal),      \n\nh = 0.01 mm, \n100% PA \n\n \n\n2 \nAdhesive sheet covering all surface \nof the conductive parts, applied by \n\nthe ironing operation. \n\nFixorete \nCont\u00ednuo (JAU \n\nT\u00eaxteis, \nPortugal),      \n\nh = 0.01 mm, \n100% PA \n\n \n\n3 \nAdhesive sheet only on the edges of \nthe conductive parts, applied by the \n\nironing operation. \n\nFixorete \nLosango (JAU \n\nT\u00eaxteis, \nPortugal),       \n\nh = 0.01 mm, \n100% PA \n\n \n\n4 \nAdhesive sheet covering all surface \nof the conductive parts, applied by \n\nthe ironing operation. \n\nFixorete \nLosango (JAU \n\nT\u00eaxteis, \nPortugal),      \n\nh = 0.01 mm, \n100% PA \n\n \n\n5 \nAdhesive sheet covering all surface \nof the conductive parts, applied by \n\nthe ironing operation. \n\nFast2Fuse \n(C&amp;T \n\nPublishing, \nUSA),             \n\nh = 0.1 mm, \n100% PES \n\n \n\nGluing technique \n\n6 \nTextile glue applied covering all \nsurface of the conductive parts. \n\nSuper Cola \nPano (Acrilex, \n\nBrazil) \n\n \n\n7 \nTextile glue \u2013 Super Cola Pano \n\n(Acrilex, Brazil) applied only on the \nedges of the conductive parts. \n\nSuper Cola \nPano (Acrilex, \n\nBrazil) \n\n \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nManufacturing \ntechnique \n\nPrototype Description of assembly process Material Schema \n\n8 \nSuper Glue applied covering all \nsurface of the conductive parts. \n\nSuper Glue 3 \nLoctite \n\n(Henkel AG &amp; \nCo., Germany) \n\n \n\n9 \nSuper Glue applied only on the   \nedges of the conductive parts. \n\nSuper Glue 3 \nLoctite \n\n(Henkel AG &amp; \nCo., Germany) \n\n \n\n10 \n\nSuper Glue drops applied on every 1 \ncm, covering all surface area of the \n\nconductive parts.

The coating process has severely affected the electrical \n\nproperties of the conductive fabric, decreasing its conductivity. For this reason, the antennas \n\nproduced with this technique did not result in viable antennas and the results of prototypes 14 \n\nand 15 were eliminated, not being presented on Figure 6-2. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-2 S11 of the microstrip patch antennas  \n\nTaking in account the inaccuracies due to the manual process, which cause small shifts on the \n\nresonance frequency, the prototypes 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16 show good results as one can \n\nsee on Figure 6-2. The prototype 10 presents the best result, nearly matching the simulated \n\nS11.  \n\nFocussing on the laminating technique, it is important to report that the prototypes 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4 were assembly ironing during 12 seconds (6 seconds for each conductive layer). However, due \n\nthe higher thickness of the Fast2Fuse adhesive sheet, the prototype 5 was maintained under \n\nheating press for 20 seconds. This has caused a shrinkage of the dielectric substrate, resulting \n\nin less five millimetres on L dimension and less two millimetres on W dimension. Also, such \n\nthick interlining predictably changes the permittivity value of the substrate as add an interlayer \n\nbetween it and the conductive layer. The association of these both phenomena contributes to \n\nthe mismatch of prototype 5, whose resonance frequency is significantly different from the \n\nsimulated one. \n\nThe sewed antenna, prototype 16, has presented a satisfactory result. Also, the grid pattern of \n\nseams contributes to create air gaps between the substrate and conductive parts, decreasing \n\nthe permittivity value of the Cordura\u00ae as more air is trapped approaching thus the permittivity \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nto 1. This way, the resonance frequency of the prototype 16 was shifted to a higher frequency, \n\nas one can observe in Figure 6-2. Air gaps between substrate and conductive layers are also \n\nclearly and visually observed on prototypes 1, 3, 9 and 12. As consequence the resonance \n\nfrequency of these antennas are also shifted to higher values than the simulated one, as shown \n\nin Figure 6-2. \n\nUnexpectedly, the glued prototypes show the worse results. Moreover, the process to apply a \n\nthin and smooth layer of glue is difficult to practice in draws of fine details as the one of the \n\nprinted monopole textile antenna, proposed in 5.4. Likewise, despite the satisfactory results \n\nof the sewed antennas, it is not possible to use the sewing technique to reproduce the printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna, due to its fine details. For these reasons, in the next Subsection, \n\namong the techniques preliminarily considered, only the laminating manufacturing technique \n\nwill be deeper analysed. \n\n6.3 Laminating Manufacturing Technique \nAs briefly surveyed on Chapter 2, the laminating process is the most common manufacturing \n\ntechnique used to assembly printed textile antennas. It consists in assembling the components \n\nwith the thermal adhesive sheet, through the ironing operation. The geometrical dimensions of \n\nthe components should remain stable to preserve the desired characteristics of the antenna.  \n\nMoreover, despite the adhesive remains at the interface of the material, in [29] authors affirm \n\nthe adhesive layer introduces extra losses in the substrate and the conductivity may thus \n\ndecrease after the laminating process, lowering the efficiency of the textile antenna. \n\nMoreover, the usage of thermal adhesive layers may also influence the conductivity properties \n\nof the conductive textile elements of the antenna, which is then important to analyse. \n\n6.3.1  Influence of using Thermal Adhesive Sheet on the Sheet \nResistance of Conductive Fabrics  \n\nIn order to verify the influence of the adhesive sheet used in the laminating process on the \n\nconductivity of the materials and thus on the performance of the textile antennas, \n\nmeasurements of sheet resistance were performed, following the ASTM standard F 1896 \u2013 Test \n\nMethod for Determine the Electrical Resistivity of a Printed Conductive Material [47].  \n\nIn this standard process, the resistance is measured with an ohmmeter, i.e. a resistance \n\nmeasuring electronic device. In this case, a sourcemeter Keithley 2602A was used.  To calculate \n\nthe sheet resistance, the measured value of resistance is divided by the number of squares \n\ncontained in the probe, given by the length divided by the width of the probe. The sheet \n\nresistance is thus given in ?/?. Figure 6-3 illustrates the set-up of the resistance measurement \n\ntests. The laminated probes were prepared using a Press MTA2012 FESPA, model SWH-2. The \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nconductive materials under test (MUT) and the dimensions of the testing probes are described \n\nin Table 6-3. Table 6-4 presents the characteristics of the adhesive sheets used in lamination. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-3 Set-up of resistance measurement test \n\nTable 6-3 Conductive materials under test \n\nConductive material Composition \nThickness \n\n(mm) \n\nSheet resistance given \nby the manufacturer \n\n(?/?) \n\nDimensions of the \nprobe (mm) \n\nLength (L) Width (W) \n\nZelt\u00ae \n100% PA - Copper \n\nand tin plated \n0.06&lt;0.09 \n\n60 30 Pure copper polyester \ntaffeta fabric (similar \n\nto Flectron\u00ae) \n\n100% PES \u2013 Copper \nplated \n\n0.08&lt;0.05 \n\nTable 6-4 Characteristics of the thermal adhesive sheets used on the lamination process \n\nAdhesive sheet I II \n\nType \nFixorete Losango \n\nGrid network \nFixorete Cont\u00ednuo \nContinuous web \n\nImage \n\n  \nComposition 100% PA \n\nThickness (mm) 0.01 \n\nMass per unit surface (g/m2) 280 210 \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nThe resistance measurements were performed under controlled environmental conditions, 24\u00baC \n\nand 35% relative humidity, at the Printed Electronics Lab of EURECAT Technologic Centre, in \n\nMatar\u00f3, Spain. The planning of experiments consisted in testing two conductive materials, Zelt\u00ae \n\nand Pure copper taffeta fabric, and analyse the influence of three main variables of the \n\nlamination process that are: usage of steam, type of adhesive layer and superficial features of \n\nthe laminated substrate. Therefore, the conductive textile materials were tested in the \n\nfollowing conditions: \n\nA. stand-alone; \n\nB. stand-alone after wet heat treatment, of 12 seconds on 200\u00baC with steam; \n\nC. with adhesive sheet type I (grid network) and II (continuous web), after applying the \n\nadhesive sheets at 200\u00baC, under 10 bar, during 6 seconds, without steam; \n\nD. laminated to three different textile substrates, the 3D spacer fabric I and II, and Cordura II, \n\ndescribed on previous Table 4-3. For each conductive material, six laminated probes were \n\nprepared, placing the conductive MUT in each of the two surfaces, face and reverse side, of \n\nall three substrates, and laminating at 200\u00baC, under 10 bar, for 12 sec., without steam. The \n\nfollowing Figure 6-4 schematises the laminated probes prepared per substrate, placing the \n\nMUT over the two faces, the rougher and smother ones. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-4 Example of the group D of probes, for 3D I substrate. \n\nFor all MUT of groups A, B and C, three probes were prepared and tested three times. Figure \n\n6-5 and Table 6-5 present the averaged values of these 9 measurements and their standard \n\ndeviation.  \n\n\n\n 77 \n\n \n\nFigure 6-5 Results of sheet resistance measurements ([?/?], n = 9) \n\nAs one can see in Figure 6-5, for both conductive MUT the lowest value of sheet resistance is \n\nobtained when testing  the material stand-alone. As expected, the measured value is higher \n\nthan the one given by the producer, but closest to the value reported in [68]. As expected, the \n\nPure copper polyester taffeta fabric presents a lower sheet resistance then Zelt\u00ae. As one may \n\nobserve, major changes occur when steam is applied on the conductive fabrics, the sheet \n\nresistance increasing 27.5% and 46.2% after applying steam, for Zelt\u00ae and Pure copper polyester \n\ntaffeta fabric, respectively.  This can be explained by the fact copper is more susceptible to \n\nthe oxidation caused by the steam than the copper and thin alloy is, as reported in [76]. When \n\nno steam is applied, and adhesive sheet is placed on one surface of the conductive materials, \n\npressing at 200\u00baC, under 10 bar for 6 seconds, a small increase on sheet resistance is observed. \n\nIn the case of Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric, when laminating the adhesive sheet I and \n\nII on the conductive material, the Rs increases 23.28% and 24%, respectively. In the case of \n\nZelt\u00ae, the increase of Rs is much lower, being 5.88% and 3.26% when applying the adhesive \n\nsheets I and II, respectively. \n\nTable 6-5 Results of sheet resistance measurements of laminated probes [?/?] \n\n  Dielectric Substrate \n  3D Fabric I 3D Fabric II Cordura II \n\nConductive \nMaterial \n\nAdhesive \nSheet \n\nFace-side  \n(n = 9) \n\nReverse-side \n(n = 9) \n\nFace-side \n(n = 9) \n\nReverse-side \n(n = 9) \n\nFace-side \n(n = 9) \n\nReverse-side \n(n = 9) \n\nPure copper \npolyester \n\ntaffeta fabric \n\nI 0.259 \u00b1 0.01 0.231 \u00b1 0.02 0.251 \u00b1 0.02 0.240 \u00b1 0.02 0.214 \u00b1 0.00 0.233 \u00b1 0.00 \nII 0.261 \u00b1 0.01 0.247 \u00b1 0.02 0.259 \u00b1 0.01 0.227 \u00b1 0.01 0.222 \u00b1 0.01 0.230 \u00b1 0.01 \n\nZelt\u00ae \nI 0.303 \u00b1 0.02 0.275 \u00b1 0.01 0.327 \u00b1 0.02 0.306 \u00b1 0.01 0.308 \u00b1 0.00 0.323 \u00b1 0.00 \nII 0.337 \u00b1 0.02 0.307 \u00b1 0.02 0.304 \u00b1 0.02 0.285 \u00b1 0.01 0.294 \u00b1 0.00 0.311 \u00b1 0.01 \n\nObserving the results of the laminated 3D fabrics in Table 6-5, it is possible to note that, \n\nindependently of the type of adhesive sheet, the lowest Rs is obtained when the conductive \n\nMUT is laminated on the reverse-side of the 3D substrates, which is the face presenting the \n\nhighest superficial roughness value, as previously characterised  (see Table 4-4). Laminating \n\nonto a rougher face corresponds to lowering the number of contact points. This way, less glue \n\n\n\n 78 \n\nof the adhesive sheet penetrates deeply on the structure of the conductive fabric, preserving \n\nso the continuity of the electric flow through the conductive fabric.  \n\nIn turn, when the MUT is laminated onto the face-side of the substrate, which is the smoother \n\nsurface, this creates a higher number of contact points, contributing for a deeper penetration \n\nof the adhesive into the MUT. In this case, the presence of the adhesive will create barriers \n\nthat cause discontinuity in the electrical current flow. As result, Rs increases. \n\nIn the case of the substrate Cordura II, despite the reverse-side is rougher than the face-side \n\n(Table 4-4), the MUT laminated on its reverse-side shows the highest Rs. Indeed, as the face-\n\nside is coated, the glue of the adhesive sheet is easily absorbed by the coating, thus remaining \n\nas an interface material, improving continuity for the current flow in this face and as result the \n\nRs decreases. \n\nAlso, for both conductive MUT, independently of the substrate, the lowest Rs was generally \n\nobtained when using the adhesive sheet I. Figure 6-6, shows the Scanning Electron Microscope \n\n(SEM) images of the face where the adhesive was not applied. As one can see in the SEM images, \n\neven in this face there is the presence of adhesive. In (a) is possible to observe that, due to \n\nthe shape of the adhesive sheet I (grid network), the glue covers a limited zone of pores, that \n\nis highlighted by the red arrows. Therefore, some area remains without adhesive and thus not \n\ninterfering with the current flow. While in (b) the adhesive sheet II (continuous web) covers all \n\npores of the surface, thus making more difficult for the electric current flow going through and \n\nthus the Rs increases.    \n\n \n(a)                                                                              (b) \n\nFigure 6-6 SEM image of the surface of Zelt\u00ae after applying in the other face, in (a) the adhesive sheet I \nand in (b) the adhesive sheet II \n\n6.3.2  Laminated Printed Monopole Antenna \n\nIn order to confirm the results obtained on previous section, two printed monopole antennas \n\nwere assembly by the laminating technique and their performance was analysed. These textile \n\nprinted monopole antennas were the same one presented in Section 5.4, made using Zelt\u00ae for \n\n\n\n 79 \n\nthe conductive part and the Cordura\u00ae fabric as dielectric substrate. To insure the geometrical \n\naccuracy, all patches were cut by a laser cutting machine (Jinan G. Weike Science &amp; Technology \n\nCo. Ltd., Jinan, China), on the Department of Aerospace Science at Universidade da Beira \n\nInterior.  \n\nTo investigate the consequence of using steam on the laminating process, and its influence on \n\nthe return loss of the printed monopole antenna, prototype A was assembled applying steam \n\nduring the ironing process, while in prototype B steam were not used. Both prototypes, A- with \n\nand B- without steam, were assembled using the thin thermal adhesive sheet I, following the \n\nironing conditions presented on Table 6-6.  \n\nTable 6-6 Ironing conditions \n\nTemperature (\u00b0C) Pressure (bar) Time (s) Vacuum table \n200 10 12 (6 for patch + 6 for ground plane) Yes \n\nTo feed the antenna a SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance, was used. Considering the \n\nexperience obtained during the manufacturing process of the printed monopole reported on \n\nSection 5.4, and the experimental knowledge of how difficult it is welding on Zelt\u00ae, the SMA \n\nconnector was glued using the conductive glue Elecolit\u00ae, with 70% of silver (Panacol \u2013 Elosol \n\nGmbH, Taunus, Germany). After, an extra layer of an elastic and conductive glue, the Wire \n\nGlue\u2122 Advanced Microcarbon Technology (Andres Products, Andover, USA), was applied to \n\nprotect the previous silver layer and reinforce the connection between the SMA connector and \n\nthe Zelt\u00ae. The S11 of prototypes A and B were measured with a VNA at Instituto de \n\nTelecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro, and the obtained results are shown on Figure 6-7.  \n\n \nFigure 6-7 Comparison between ironing processes with and without steam \n\nAccording to the measured results presented on Figure 6-7, one can see a higher mismatch on \n\nthe frequency of the antenna made using steam during the ironing process. In order to \n\ninvestigate the cause of this mismatch, the thickness of the antenna was measured, using KES-\n\n\n\n 80 \n\nF-3 Compressional Tester of Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for fabrics. The thickness of the \n\nantenna made without steam is 0.62 mm, and the thickness of the antenna made with steam is \n\n0.60 mm. This difference can be due to the higher compaction of the materials when steam is \n\napplied. As one can see in the SEM images of cross section of the antenna shown on Figure 6-8, \n\nin the antenna without steam the adhesive sheet (highlighted by yellow arrows in image (a)) \n\nremains at the interface between the conductive and dielectric layers. However, when steam \n\nis applied, the adhesive sheet merges with the textile structure (highlighted by green arrows \n\nin image (b)).  \n\nBased on the results and analysis presented on Subsection 6.3.1, this effect is responsible for a \n\ndecrease in the conductivity due to the presence of the glue among the conductive yarns. \n\nMoreover, the presence of the adhesive sheet into the Cordura\u00ae fabric will presumably change, \n\neven if slightly, its permittivity. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is important to further \n\nstudy and quantify the effect of steam in the performance of the antenna, in order to consider \n\nit in the design of the antenna improving this way the modelling and simulation of its \n\nperformance. \n\n \n(a)                                                                            (b) \n\nFigure 6-8 SEM images: cross-section of the antenna assembled (a) without steam and (b) with steam \n\n6.3.3  Influence of the Cutting Direction of the Conductive Fabrics \n\nThe cutting process of the conductive material is critical, mainly when the antenna has very \n\nthin lines as for instance the Wf dimension of the printed monopole (see 5.4). Beyond the \n\ncutting precision, the alignment of the fabric with the cutting direction may also influence the \n\nperformance of the antenna. Therefore, in order to analyse the influence of the orientation of \n\nthe conductive woven (Zelt\u00ae) in the S11 parameter, an extra prototype of printed monopole was \n\nfabricated:  \n\n\u2022 Prototype C: patch of antenna was cut on bias of the fabric (45\u00b0). \n\nThis prototype was tested and its results were compared to the ones of prototype B, whose \n\npatch was cut parallel to the warp of the fabric. One should note that Zelt\u00ae is a plain weave \n\n\n\n 81 \n\nwoven with the same amount of yarns per cm2 (45 yarns) in the warp and in the weft, and for \n\nthis reason only the warp direction was considered. Both prototypes were assembled using the \n\nthermal adhesive sheet I, without steam, following the ironing conditions presented on Table \n\n6-6. Figure 6-9 presents the simulated and measured values of S11 parameter of both antennas. \n\n \nFigure 6-9 Simulated and measured return loss of laminated antennas \n\nBoth antennas, produced by the lamination technique, have shown good results, as the S11 \n\nparameter shows. The orientation of the conductive patch does not seem to influence the \n\nperformance of these antennas. As one can see on Figure 6-9, the measurements match the \n\nsimulation fairly well, although there is a small shift of the frequency. This shift of frequency \n\nmight be due to the narrow manufacturing tolerances that exist even when cutting the fabric \n\nby laser. Still, the reflection coefficient is low at the operating frequencies, meaning that the \n\nantenna presents a good impedance match in both GSM and DCS bands. \n\n6.4  Embroidery Manufacturing Technique \nEmbroidering is a promising method in terms of repeatability and mass-manufacturing as the \n\nembroidered antennas do not need a cutting neither lamination process, thus reducing the \n\nproduction costs. For this reason, several embroidered antennas have been proposed, for \n\ninstance spiral antennas [25-26], RFID tags [27-28], and antennas without a ground plane [29\u2013\n\n31]. This Section explores the embroidering technique to produce antennas that can be easily \n\napplied in clothing as an emblem. This way the embroidering technique might enlarge the \n\ndissemination of the textile antennas into clothing.  \n\nThe experimental study on embroidering is based on the same printed monopole antenna, \n\npreviously presented at Section 5.4. As this antenna requires a ground plane, the embroidering \n\nmanufacturing process has to be adapted in order to eliminate the short cuts between the patch \n\nand the ground plane. Therefore, the construction technique of these embroidered antennas \n\nwas: firstly, embroidering the patch in a thin textile; secondly, cut the embroidery; and, finally, \n\nattach the embroidery to the dielectric substrate using the thermal adhesive sheet. This process \n\n\n\n 82 \n\nis the same one used to produce the traditional emblems for cloth customization. Further, the \n\nSMA connector was glued using conductive glues, as described in previous Subsection 6.3.2.  \n\nFive antennas were developed with this technique, using an automatic embroidering machine \n\n(SWF MA-6, SWF Central, Creve Coeur, USA), on the Department of Textile Science and \n\nTechnology at Universidade da Beira Interior, see Figure 6-10. The patches were embroidered \n\nin the Atlantic fabric (B. W. Wernerfelt Group, S\u00f8borg, Danmark) using Silverpam yarn (Tibtech \n\nInnovations, Roncq, France). Table 6-7 describes the characteristics of these materials used on \n\nthe embroidering process of the printed monopole textile antennas. \n\nTable 6-7 Characteristics of the materials used to develop embroidered printed monopoles \n\nConductive material \nYarn \n\nLinear mass \n(dtex) \n\nComposition Finish \nConductivity \n\n(mS/m) \nSilverpam 250 100% PA Silver plated 0.005 \n\nEmbroidery base \nFabric \n\nMass per unit \nsurface (g/m2) \n\nComposition Finish \nThickness \n\n(mm) \n\nAtlantic 120 100% PES \nOil + water \nrepellent \n\n0.3 \n\n \nFigure 6-10 SWF MA-6 automatic embroidering machine \n\nThe orientation of the stitch was considered by performing stitches along four different \n\ndirections for antennas 1, 3, 4, and 5. The number of stiches was considered by varying the \n\nfloat of the stitch for antennas 2 and 3. To avoid differences in the fringe effect on the feed \n\nline (Wf \u00d7 Lf) due the different directions of the stitches, all antennas have feed lines \n\nembroidered with a horizontal step stitch. The parameters of the embroidery are described in \n\nTable 6-8, and Figure 6-11 shows the embroidered patches.  \n\n\n\n 83 \n\nTable 6-8 Parameters of the embroidered antennas \n\nAntenna \nprototype \n\n1 2 3 4 5 \n\nDescription of \nstitch \n\nHorizontal \nstep stitch \n\nSatin with \nvertical step \n\nVertical step \nstitch, with \n\nhorizontal step \n\nDiagonal step \nstitch (direction: \n\n152\u00b0/quadrant 2), \nwith horizontal \n\nstep \n\nDiagonal step \nstitch (direction: \n30\u00b0/quadrant 1), \nwith horizontal \n\nstep \n\nDraft of stitch \n\n     \nNumber of \n\nstitches \n1255 2084 1378 1360 1361 \n\nYarn \nconsumption (g) \n\n0.27 0.39 0.22 0.23 0.27 \n\nYarn \nconsumption \n\nper \nembroidered \narea (g/m2) \n\n489 706 398 416 489 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6-11 Embroidered patches of printed monopole textile antenna \n\nFigure 6-12 shows the simulated and measured values of the S11 parameter of these antennas, \n\nmeasured with a VNA, at Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es - Aveiro. It is clear that the \n\nmeasurements match closely to the simulations. A prototype 3 is the one with the best match \n\nof the return loss. \n\n\n\n 84 \n\n \nFigure 6-12 Simulated and measured return loss of embroidered antennas \n\nThe prototype 3 presents the closest result to the simulation line. This can be due to the fact \n\nthe embroidery stitch direction is parallel of the feed line, homogenizing the current flow [75]. \n\nPrototypes 4 and 5 present very similar behaviours that might indicate the angle of the diagonal \n\ndirection is not influencing it. Coherently, prototype 1 shows the higher shift of the frequency \n\nthat can be due to the fact the direction of the embroidery stitch is perpendicular to the feed \n\nline. Additionally, prototype 2 was made using a vertical stitch, as well as prototype 3, having \n\nhowever, a higher number of stitches. This may make the current flow less continuous, due the \n\nconstant breaks and higher number of air gaps in the embroidery  as already reported by other \n\nauthors [36]. This probably reduces the conductivity of the patch, which explain the difference \n\nbetween the magnitudes of the return loss of prototypes 3 and 2. \n\n6.5 Conclusions \nConsidering the manufacturing techniques, seams can be considered since non-conductive \n\nthreads are used to avoid short cuts between the patch and the ground plane. Textile glue is \n\nnot enough to completely assembly the conductive fabrics. Although gluing with permanent \n\nglue and super glue works well, gluing is a problematic technique as it is difficult to apply a \n\nsmooth and continuous portion of glue. \n\nIn the laminating technique, a thin adhesive sheet most be used to minimise its interference \n\non the permittivity of the dielectric material. Also, the presence of the glue of the adhesive \n\nsheet affects the sheet resistance of the conductive fabric. The choice of a patterned adhesive \n\nsheet, such as sheet I, whose pattern is a grid network, can reduce the discontinuity of the \n\ncurrent flow. On the laminating process, when the conductive material is assembled to a \n\nsmooth face of the substrate, its sheet resistance will increase due to the high number of \n\ncontact points which cause discontinuities on the electric current flow. Therefore, when \n\nproducing antennas using substrates with different faces, as for instance the 3D spacer fabrics, \n\nto preserve the conductivity of the material of the patch, it should preferably be assembled to \n\nthe rougher face of the substrate.  \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nWhen laminating, the ironing process without steam seems to be preferable as it better \n\npreserves the electromagnetic performance of the materials. Additionally, this work also shows \n\nthat the orientation of the conductive fabric used for the patch, plain weave woven, is not \n\ninfluencing the performance of the laminated antenna.  \n\nWhen embroidering antennas, it is preferable to use stitches that are parallel to the feed line, \n\nto ensure a continuous current flow. In addition, this work shows that the number of stitches \n\nin the embroidery may contribute to increase the conductivity of some elements, thus \n\nimproving the performance of the antenna. Therefore, it is a parameter that should be \n\nconsidered when manufacturing embroidered antennas. \n\nFinally, embroidering is a promising technique to customize the application of antennas on \n\nclothing and fashion, as embroidered antennas may be addressed as emblems are. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 86 \n\n \n\n\n\n 87 \n\n7 Chapter \n\n \n\nSmart Coat with a Fully Embedded Antenna for RF \n\nEnergy Harvesting \n\n \n\nThe content of this Chapter was partially published on Sensors Journal (2016), Smart Fabric \n\nand Wearable Technologies Conference (2015), 10th European Conference on Antennas and \n\nPropagation (2016) and Electronic Conference on Sensors Applications (2016). This Chapter \n\npresents the E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat. It has an embedded dual-band printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna for RF energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands. \n\nThis printed antenna is fully integrated, as its dielectric is the textile material composing the \n\ncoat itself. The E-Caption illustrates the innovative concept of textile antennas that can be \n\nmanipulated as simple emblems. The comparison of results obtained, before and after the \n\nintegration of the antenna into cloth, shows that the integration and the presence of the \n\nhuman body does not affect the behaviour of the antenna.  \n\n \n\n7.1 Introduction \nThe recent technological developments made electronic devices become imperative and \n\nindispensable, being present in our daily routines, all over the world. The development of smart \n\nand wearable textile products requires bringing technologies to the consumer in an acceptable \n\nand desirable format.  \n\nIn the framework of textile antennas for RF energy harvesting, as reviewed on 5.2, different \n\ndesigns have been proposed in the past decade. Nevertheless, only two works [112], [113], \n\nknown to the author, have outlined the integration of these antennas in smart clothing. This \n\nleads to conclude that, despite the advance on the manufacturing techniques of the textile \n\nantennas, their integration into clothing is still a difficult task.  \n\nUntil now, the printed textile antennas have been produced separately and are then posteriorly \n\nintegrated in the lining of the garment, into pockets or simply glued to the cloth. Only on the \n\nRFID context textile antennas have been integrated in products in a pleasing way, for instance \n\nfor commercial advertisement proposes, where antennas are dissimulated in brand names and \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nlogotypes [73], [141]. Nevertheless, none author has analysed the influence of its integration \n\non clothing on its performance.  \n\n7.2 Integration into Clothing \nThis Chapter proposes an innovative solution that presents the first printed monopole textile \n\nantenna (presented on 5.4) manufactured directly in the clothing as it is made with the same \n\ntextile materials composing the cloth. This innovative solution to integrate antennas into cloths \n\nis illustrated on Figure 7-1. The antenna is integrated into the clothing by manipulating it as a \n\nsimple emblem. In the future, the antennas can be incorporated into patterns and drawings, \n\nmixing conductive and non-conductive embroideries, creating fashionable emblems that \n\nfunction as antennas. These \u201cemblem\u201d antennas may be accessible to the end user for \n\ncustomization of smart cloth, for several applications. \n\n \nFigure 7-1 Comparison of techniques of integration of antennas into cloth (a) typical integration and (b) \n\n\u201cemblem\u201d approach \n\nThe curvature of the human body consists of a superposition of bends in arbitrary directions. \n\nThis hinders the integration of the conventional and rigid antennas into clothing. Due the \n\nflexibility and drapability of fabrics, textile antennas have been used for on-body applications.  \n\nHowever, when the textile fabric adapts to the surface topology it bends and deforms, causing \n\nchanges to its electromagnetic properties and thus influencing the antenna performance [28], \n\n[29], [36]. Indeed, the bending and the elongation of the dielectric fabric influences its \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n 89 \n\npermittivity and its thickness, which affects the resonance frequency of the antenna and \n\nespecially the bandwidth, as explained in [28], [36].  \n\nThe relationship between the performance of ex-situ textile antennas and the curvature of the \n\nhuman body have been studied in the last decades. To simulate the curvature of arms and legs, \n\nthe authors have used PVC pipes to bend the antenna in different radius of curvature, along \n\nthe width and length dimensions [36], [58], [142]. The measurements in the bended antennas, \n\nhave shown a detuning of resonance frequency, independently of the direction of bending and \n\nof the radii of the pipes, in comparison to the resonance frequency of antennas on flat state \n\n[36], [58], [142]. Also, under bend conditions, as smaller bend the radius the is, as lower the \n\nresonance frequency becomes [36], [142].  \n\nThe place to integrate the printed monopole antenna on the coat, has to be a place with large \n\ncurvature radius, in order to minimize the influence of bending on the performance of the \n\nantenna.  In this framework, considering the unobtrusive areas to integrate wearable devices \n\nidentified in [143], the chosen area to place the antenna was \u201cwaist and hips\u201d, as it is also an \n\narea easily accessible as one can see on Figure 7-2. \n\n \n\nFigure 7-2 Unobtrusive areas to integrate wearable devices, according to [143]  \n\n7.3  E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat \nThe integration of textile antennas for energy harvesting into smart clothing emerges as a \n\nparticularly interesting solution when the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice, such \n\nas in wearable devices. A fully-embedded antenna in clothing contributes for the integration \n\nof electronic devices in less obtrusive ways, improving the good aesthetic and the technical \n\ndesign, making the garment more comfortable and desirable to the final consumer. This might \n\n\n\n 90 \n\nenhance niche markets where form and function work together in order to create new \n\nattractive textile products that can assist the user in many aspects of their daily routine. \n\nThe E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat was developed combining these concepts. It is a \n\nsmart coat for electromagnetic harvesting, named E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat, in \n\nwhich the antenna has a substrate that is continuous and was cut according to the pattern-\n\nmaking of the coat, thus being part of it [127]. The integrated printed monopole textile antenna \n\nwas manufactured based in the results presented on Chapter 6. That means, the patch was cut \n\nparallel to the warp, using laser cutting machine, and was produced by laminating \n\nmanufacturing technique, without steam on the process. Also, the SMA connector was glued \n\nusing conductive glues. The coat is made of Cordura\u00ae and of a 3D fabric (Reference 3003, LMA\u2014\n\nLeandro Manuel Ara\u00fajo, Ltda., Matosinhos, Portugal). Figure 7-3 shows the E-Caption coat with \n\nthe integrated printed monopole textile antenna for RF energy harvesting. Also, Figure 7-4 \n\npresents the logotype of E-Caption created for marketing proposes, such as when the E-Caption \n\nwas presented on a television show (see Appendix E). Figure 7-5 shows the integrated 5-stage \n\nDickson multiplier voltage, and illustrate the system operation. \n\n      \nFigure 7-3  E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat (Credits: Sophia Cueto Photography and Make Up \n\nArtist, Model: Benilde Reis) \n\n \nFigure 7-4  Logotype of E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n \n(a)                                                      (b) \n\nFigure 7-5  Textile printed monopole antenna integrated on clothing.

Thus, this Subsection will \n\ndescribe the performance of the antenna belonging to the E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable \n\nCoat. The coat was tested in the anechoic chamber, at Instituto de Telecomunuca\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro, \n\nas shown on Figure 7-6.  \n\n \n(a)                                             (b)                                    (c) \n\nFigure 7-6 Performance of the antenna in the anechoic chamber (a) in free space and (b,c) on-body \nmeasurements \n\n\n\n 92 \n\nFigure 7-7 presents the variation in the S11 parameter obtained through numerical simulation \n\nand measured in free space, before and after the integration into the smart coat. It is possible \n\nto see the agreement between the simulated and measured values even in the on-body \n\nmeasurements. In both situations, the textile antenna presents an operating frequency range \n\ncapable of completely covering the GSM 900 (880\u2013960 MHz) and the DCS 1800 (1710\u20131880 MHz). \n\n \nFigure 7-7 Simulated and measured return loss, before/after dressing the coat \n\nThe Figure 7-8 shows the radiation pattern of the antenna fully integrated into the smart coat \n\nstructure, the free-space and on-body measurements. Even after integrated into clothing, the \n\nradiation pattern of the antenna is clearly omnidirectional. The results depicted on Figure 7-8 \n\ncorresponds to the XZ plane. This is the only possible and measurable plane, as can be seen in \n\nprevious Figure 7-6, due to the configuration and placement of the antenna on the coat. \n\nNevertheless, it is the most relevant plane in order to evaluate the omnidirectional \n\ncharacteristic of the antenna. Moreover, given the position of the antenna on the coat, it is \n\nclear that the direction at which the antenna will present less influence from the coat or from \n\nthe person occurs at nearly 30\u00b0 in the broadside direction. This is confirmed by the results \n\ndepicted on Figure 7-8. \n\n\n\n 93 \n\n \n                                   (a)                                                                        (b) \n\nFigure 7-8 Measured radiation pattern of the textile antenna into the coat, free-space and on-body \nmeasurements at (a) 900 MHz and (b) 1800 MHz \n\nAccording to the results presented in Figure 7-8, one may conclude that, as expected, the mass \n\nof the coat and mainly of the person influence the radiation characteristic of the antenna. In \n\nthe measurement of the empty jacket, when the coat places between the probe antenna and \n\nthe test antenna, around 160\u00b0, there is a reduction in the gain of the antenna, which is due to \n\nthe presence of a large dielectric body, that is, the coat. Nevertheless, the antenna shows a \n\nnearly omnidirectional pattern.  \n\nThe on-body antenna performs differently. Since the human body is conductive, it absorbs and \n\nreflects radiofrequency waves. The results on Figure 7-8 show that when the body is behind the \n\ntest antenna, at 30\u00b0 broadside, a slight increase in gain is measured. However, when the body \n\nis between the probe and the test antenna, at 160\u00b0, it will absorb a high amount of radiation \n\nand will reflect the rest in the opposite direction, shielding the test antenna and, thus, create \n\na null of radiation at this point. This happens for both frequencies, being clearer at 1800 MHz. \n\n7.5 Conclusions \nIn the future, garments will not only communicate social conditions or protect the human body \n\nagainst the extremes of nature, but will also provide information and communication tools. \n\nClothes are becoming able to communicate wirelessly without the need of large and expensive \n\nequipment. This is possible because textile technologies can produce new types of sensors and \n\nantennas that are so small, flexible, and inexpensive that they can be applied in different types \n\nof clothing, shoes, and accessories. \n\nThe effective integration of wearable systems contributes to the advance of the IoT. Based on \n\nthe wearability guidelines, the innovative concept of producing textile antennas to integrate \n\ninto clothing by simply manipulating it as an \u201cemblem\u201d has emerged, may improve the usage \n\nof the wearable technologies. In the future, the wearable antennas can be incorporated into \n\n\n\n 94 \n\ntextile patterns and drawings, creating fashionable antennas. These \u201cemblem\u201d antennas may \n\nbe easily acceded by the end user, for customization of smart cloth for several applications.  \n\nThe E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat is the first prototype of this concept, integrating an \n\n\u201cemblem\u201d antenna capable of completely covering GSM900 (880\u2013960 MHz) and the DCS1800  \n\n(1710\u20131880 MHz) bands, for IoT applications. In this context, the integration of textile antennas \n\nfor energy harvesting into smart clothing can be a solution for recharging wearable devices, \n\nsuch as low-power electronics and WBSN. \n\nEmbedding antennas in clothing contributes for the advance of the integration of electronic \n\ndevices in less obtrusive way, making the smart clothes more comfortable. In the E-caption, \n\nthe antenna is manufactured directly on the clothing, having a continuous dielectric substrate \n\nmade with the textile materials composing the coat. Therefore, a continuous substrate of the \n\nantenna does not influence its performance. Moreover, the presented results show that, despite \n\nthe masses of the coat and of the body influence the radiation characteristic of the integrated \n\nantenna, the antenna still shows a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern. \n\n\n\n 95 \n\n8 Chapter \n\n \n\nDevelopment of a Continuous Substrate Integrating \n\nthe Ground Plane \n\n \n\nThe exponential growth in the wearable market is boosting the industrialization process of \n\nmanufacturing textile antennas. The patch of planar antennas can be easily cut, embroidered \n\nor screen printed by machines. The conception of an optimal industrial substrate that meets \n\nall the mechanical and electromagnetic requirements is still a challenge. Following the \n\ncontinuous substrate concept presented in previous Chapter 7, this Chapter presents a \n\ncontinuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material, \n\nwhich is a double fabric that integrates the dielectric substrate and the conductive ground \n\nplane in a single textile, eliminating thus one laminating step in the manufacturing process of \n\nmicrostrip patch antennas. Three SIGP materials, that are weft knitted spacer fabrics, were \n\ndeveloped in partnership with the company Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, creating synergy \n\nbetween academy and industry. The tests of the performance of SIGP show that the integration \n\nof the ground plane into the substrate changes the dielectric constant of the material. Despite \n\nthis, after the accurate dielectric and electrical characterization, the SIGP I has shown a good \n\nperformance as dielectric substrate of microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting. \n\n \n\n8.1 Introduction \nAccording to the Wearable Technology 2017-2027: Markets, Players and Forecasts report by \n\nIDTechEx [148], the market for wearable devices will reach over $150 billions per year until \n\n2027. Technical textiles will follow the same path as well [9]. For this reason, the \n\nindustrialization of the manufacturing processes, aiming the mass production of textile \n\nantennas, emerge with great relevance.  \n\nAlthough the patch of microstrip antennas may have fine details, they can be easily cut or \n\nembroidered by industrial machines, as previously discussed on Chapter 6. Therefore, the focus \n\nof this Chapter will be on the industrial production of a dielectric substrate together with the \n\nground plane. Based on previous results reported in Chapter 7, which have proven that a \n\ncontinuous substrate does not influence the performance of the textile antenna, this chapter \n\n\n\n 96 \n\npresents a new continuous substrate which, in plus, integrates the ground plane. This new \n\nmaterial is from now designated SIGP - Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane.  \n\nThe SIGP is thus a novel textile material that integrates the dielectric substrate and the \n\nconductive ground plane in a single sheet, as one can see on Figure 8-1. This way, the \n\nmanufacturing process of the textile microstrip patch antennas may become easier and faster. \n\nThe integration of the ground plane into the substrate can contribute to decrease the losses \n\nand mismatches caused by the incurrences due to the hand-made manufacturing process. Also, \n\nthe continuous ground plane, shields the antenna radiation, ensuring that the human body is \n\nexposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. \n\n \nFigure 8-1 Continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane - 3D Weft knitted spacer fabric (white) \n\nwith an integrated conductive layer (gold) \n\nThe concept of integrating the antenna in a multiple fabric, was already presented in [80], \n\n[149], [150]. In these works, the authors present a 3D Integrated Microstrip Antenna, which is \n\nwoven into a 3D orthogonal fabric. This microstrip antenna, for aerospace application, was \n\ndeveloped to work as radar L-band (1.5 GHz). It was made using copper yarns in the conductive \n\nparts and aramid (Kevlar 129) yarns in the dielectric layer. Despite the measured resonance \n\nfrequency is 1.8 GHz, higher than the planned one, this antenna shows a great result as proves \n\nthat the antenna can be integrated in a unique material, composed of multiple layers. \n\n8.2 Method and Materials \nThe SIGP is a weft knitted spacer fabric, produced in a double circular machine, the V-LEC6BS \n\nKnitting Machine (Monarch Knitting Machinery Ltd., Leicester, England). Figure 8-2 presents \n\nthis machine, which has a routable needle cylinder and needle dial, being capable to produce \n\na 3D weft knit with differentiated conductive and dielectric faces. The SIGP was developed and \n\nmanufactured at Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, following the manufacturing process of the \n\nPatent US 6779369 B2 [151]. Figure 8-3 presents the scheme of the needles and yarns on the \n\nknitting machine. \n\n\n\n 97 \n\n \nFigure 8-2 V-LEC6BS Knitting Machine by Monarch Knitting Machinery Ltd. (Courtesy Borgstena Textile \n\nPortugal) \n\n \n\nFigure 8-3 Scheme of the Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane. (a) knitting structure diagram, being \nthe green, orange and purple yarns correspondent to the conductive, dielectric and spacer yarns, \n\nrespectively, based on [151]; (b) SEM image of the SIGP I, with 35X amplification \n \n\nBased on the knitting structure presented in Figure 8-3, three different SIGP were developed, \n\nusing the following yarns: \n\n\u2022 for the dielectric substrate a 100% PES yarn.  \n\n\u2022 for the spacer yarn, a Monofilament FH yarn, 100% PET, 225 dtex, produced by Monosuisse \n\nAG (Emmenbr\u00fccke, Switzerland).  \n\n\u2022 for the conductive layer two different yarns, \u201cShieldex\u00ae 117/17 dtex Z-turns HC+B\u201d and \n\n\u201cShieldex\u00ae 22/1 dtex + 113/32 dtex PES\u201d, produced by Shieldex Trading (Palmyra, USA).  \n\n\n\n 98 \n\nThe Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn (Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 dtex Z-turns HC+B) is a high tenacity PA 6.6 \n\nfilament yarn, composed by 17 twisted filaments coated with 99% pure silver. The linear mass \n\nof this yarn is 141 dtex and it presents a resistivity&lt;500 ?/m (values given by the \n\nmanufacturer). The Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 yarn (Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 dtex + 113/32 dtex PES) is a twisted \n\nyarn composed by two different materials: a PA 6 monofilament plated with 99% pure silver \n\ntwisted with 32 PES filaments. The linear mass of this yarn is 145 dtex and it presents a \n\nresistivity&lt;30.000 ?/m (values given by the manufacturer).  \n\nThe choice of these two materials is founded on the linear mass (dtex) of the yarns that must \n\nbe suitable for work with the V-LEC6BS knitting machine and of course on their electrical \n\nconductivity. The price of the yarns was considered as well. Thus, the Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn \n\nwas selected because of its highly conductivity, suitable for producing antennas. The Shieldex\u00ae \n\n22/1 yarn was selected because of its price (82\u20ac/Kg, in October 2016), being four times less \n\nexpensive than the other one (307\u20ac/Kg, in October 2016). These yarns were worked separately \n\nand also mixed, looking for a good compromise between conductivity and price.    \n\nThe three developed SIGP are listed below: \n\n\u2022 SIGP I -  Ground plane made using the Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn; \n\n\u2022 SIGP II -  Ground plane made using the Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 yarn; \n\n\u2022 SIGP III -  Ground plane made mixing both conductive yarns, alternating yarns every two \n\ncourses.  \n\nPrevious Figure 8-1 presents an image of the SIGP I material, which is composed of one \n\nconductive face made of Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn, and one dielectric face made of 100% PES yarn. \n\nAlso, a control and reference material was produced using the 100% PES yarn on both sides of \n\nthe spacer knit. This control material aims to serve as reference to compare with and to analyse \n\nthe influence of the integration of the ground plane in the properties of the dielectric substrate. \n\nThe structural parameters and the electromagnetic properties of these spacer knits will be \n\ndescribed in the next Subsections. \n\n8.3 Structural Parameters  \nThe thickness and the surface roughness of the samples were measured using the KES-F \u2013 3 \n\nCompressional Tester of Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics. The tests were performed \n\nat the Textile Department of UBI, under controlled environmental conditions, 25\u00baC and 65% RH, \n\ntesting 5 probes of each SIGP, for determining the total thickness. The thickness of the \n\nconductive layer was measured trough SEM image analysis, at the Laboratory of Electron \n\nMicroscopy of UBI. The superficial porosity was calculated through the image analyser method \n\npreviously presented on Chapter 4, using SEM images with 35X amplification. Table 8-1 \n\nsummarises the structural parameters of the SIGP. Table 8-2 shows the structural parameters \n\nof the reference spacer knit. \n\n\n\n 99 \n\nTable 8-1 Summary of structural parameters of the produced SIGP \n\nSIGP Thickness \n(mm) \n\nThickness of \nconductive \nlayer (mm) \n\nDensity (number of loops/cm) \nSuperficial Porosity (%) \n\nDielectric face Conductive face \n\nwales courses wales courses Conductive face Dielectric face \n\nI \n\n2 \u00b1 0.01 0.043 18 13 18 13 \n45.71 \n\n45.04 II 43.90 \n\nIII 44.50 \n \n\nTable 8-2 Structural parameters of the reference spacer knit \n\n \nThickness \n\n(mm) \n\nDensity (number of loops/cm) \nSuperficial Porosity (%) \n\nFace side Reverse side \nwales courses wales courses Face side Reverse side \n\nReference \nspacer knit \n\n2 \u00b1 0.01 18 13 18 13 45.02 45.01 \n\nAs one can see on Table 8-1, despite the same number of loops in both dielectric and conductive \n\nfaces, the superficial porosity is slightly different. As previously explained in Chapter 4, the \n\nsuperficial porosity depends on the structure of the knit as well as on the properties of the \n\nyarns. In these materials, the knit structure is unique and for this reason, the small variations \n\nin the superficial porosity of the conductive face are due to the differences of the diameter \n\nand title of the conductive yarns. Indeed, the SIGP I, which is made of Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn, \n\nthe thinnest conductive yarn (141 dtex), presents the highest superficial porosity. Accordingly, \n\nthe SIGP II that was made of Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 yarn, the thickest one (145 dtex), presents the \n\nlowest superficial porosity. While the SIGP III shows an intermediate superficial porosity value, \n\nas expected as it is made of a mixture of both conductive yarns.  \n\n8.4 Characterization of the Electromagnetic Properties \n\n8.4.1  Dielectric Constant  \n\nAs the SIGP has a conductive layer, the Resonator-Based Experimental Technique previously \n\npresented in Chapter 4 cannot be used to characterize the dielectric properties. For this reason, \n\nthe dielectric constant was measured through the Microstrip Resonator Patch Method [20]. As \n\npresented in 3.3.4, this method consists in designing a microstrip patch antenna using an \n\nestimated ?r value, and calculating the real ?r based on the shift of the measured resonant \n\nfrequency of the tested antenna. \n\nThus, one microstrip patch antenna was designed to resonate at 2.45 GHz and to be \n\nmanufactured using the three SIGP materials. The antenna was simulated in the CST Microwave \n\nStudio 2017 full-wave simulator, using estimated values of ?r = 1.10 and tan? = 0.006. These \n\nestimated values were based on the obtained results for the 3D fabrics, during the dielectric \n\n\n\n 100 \n\ncharacterization in Chapter 4. For manufacturing the radiant element, i.e. the conductive \n\npatch, the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric (previous Table 6-3) was used and assembled \n\nby laminating technique. As the conductivity of the ground plane is unknown, the antenna was \n\nsimulated considering the conductivity value of the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric. Figure \n\n8-4 presents the design and the dimensions (mm) of this microstrip patch antenna. \n\nAs control, a prototype using the reference spacer knit was also manufactured, using the Pure \n\ncopper polyester taffeta fabric for both patch and ground plane.  \n\n \n\nFigure 8-4 Microstrip patch antenna designed for the dielectric characterization, dimensions in mm \n\nAll patches were cut on laser cutting (Jinan G. Weike Science &amp; Technology Co. Ltd., Jinan, \n\nChina), on Department of Aerospace Science at Universidade da Beira Interior; and the antennas \n\nwere assembled by the laminating process, using the Adhesive Sheet II (previous Table 6-4). \n\nDue to the knitted structure, it was impossible welding the SMA connector in the ground plane \n\nas usually performed in some previous antennas. For this reason, the SMA connector was glued \n\nto the ground plane using a conductive glue Elecolit\u00ae and to ensure the mechanical stability an \n\nextra coating of Slow-Cure\u2122 Epoxy (Bob Smith Industries Inc., Atascadero, USA) was applied. In \n\nthe patch side, the SMA connector was welded on the conductive fabric, as usual. The antennas \n\nwere tested using a VNA, at Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro and Figure 8-5 presents the \n\nobtained results. \n\n\n\n 101 \n\n \nFigure 8-5 Measured S11 of the microstrip patch antenna designed for the dielectric characterization \n\nAs one can see on Figure 8-5, the prototype 4, that is the control antenna which was made with \n\nthe reference spacer knit and the conductive fabric (Pure copper polyester taffeta), presents \n\nthe best agreement with the simulated S11. This was expected, as the simulation was made \n\nusing the conductivity value of the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric. This result shows that \n\nthe estimated values of ?r = 1.10 and tan? = 0.006 characterize well the dielectric behaviour \n\nof the reference spacer knit. \n\nPrototypes 2 and 3 do not work, due to the low conductivity of the ground plane. These results \n\nare thus discarded. Prototype 1 presents an acceptable performance. Comparing the return \n\nloss of prototypes 1 and 4, it is possible to see that the integration of the ground plane on the \n\nsubstrate increases the dielectric constant value, as the resonant frequency of prototype 1 \n\nshifted for a lower frequency. This can be explained by the fact the integration of the ground \n\nplane reduces the thickness of the substrate, thus changing the Q-factor of the antenna as \n\ndescribed in 2.2.1.1. Indeed, the total thickness value is 2 mm for all knit spacer fabrics herein \n\nconsidered. However, the SIGP fabrics already include the ground plane, whose thickness is \n\n0,043 mm (Table 8-1), and thus its dielectric substrate is thinner than 2 mm. While the control \n\nantenna has a substrate 2 mm thick overlapped by the conductive fabric whose thickness is \n\nequal 0,08 mm (Table 6-3).   \n\nBased on these results, a new simulation of the prototype 1 was made, changing the ?r value \n\nuntil the new simulated return loss be in agreement with the already measured return loss, to \n\nthen extract the real ?r value. Figure 8-6 plots the result of the S11 obtained in the new \n\nsimulation and the previously result obtained testing the prototype 1.  \n\n\n\n 102 \n\n \nFigure 8-6 Plot of the previously measured S11 and of the new simulation of the prototype 1 \n\nThrough comparing these two return losses, the new value ?r = 1.28 is extracted, according to \n\nthe method presented at 3.3.4. Assuming this ?r as the real value of the substrate, one may \n\nestimate the conductivity of the ground plane of SIGP I as ? = 50 kS/m. The validation of these \n\nresults is further presented in Section 8.5. \n\n8.4.2  Surface Resistance \n\nTo characterize the conductivity of the ground plane, the sheet resistance was measured \n\nfollowing the ASTM Standard F 1896 \u2013 Test Method for Determine the Electrical Resistivity of a \n\nPrinted Conductive Material [47], already presented in 6.3.1. The tests were performed at the \n\nDepartment of Aerospace Science of UBI, under the environmental conditions of 25\u00baC and 50% \n\nRH. Four probes of each SIGP were measured with an Agilent HP 34401A Multimeter. Also, the \n\nconductivity was calculated by the Equation 2-5. Table 8-3 reports the measured results. \n\nTable 8-3 Electrical properties of the SIGP  \n\nSIGP \nDimensions of the probe (mm) Sheet resistance \n\n(?/?) \nConductivity \n\n(kS/m) Length (L) Width (W) \nI \n\n30 60 \n\n0.428 \u00b1 0.03 54  \nII 22.332 \u00b1 1.99 1 \nIII 2.224 \u00b1 0.31 10 \n\nAs expected, the ground plane of SIGP I material, made of the most conductive yarn (Shieldex\u00ae \n\n117/17), has shown the best result, presenting the lowest Rs value. Accordingly, the ground \n\nplane of SIGP II material, made of the less conductive yarn (Shieldex\u00ae 22/1), presents the \n\nhighest Rs value. While the ground plane of the SIGP III material presents an intermediate Rs \n\nvalue. The conductivity of the knitted fabric depends on the properties of the conductive yarns \n\ncomposing it.  Observing the SEM images, with 200X of amplification, presented in Figure 8-7, \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nit is possible to see in (a) that all filaments of the Shieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarn are coated with silver. \n\nWhile in (b) one can observe that in the Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 yarn there exists only one conductive \n\nplated monofilament that is twisted with non-conductive filaments. This observation \n\ncorroborates the results obtained for the sheet resistance of the ground plane. Also, in (c) it is \n\npossible to observe loops establishing some but few contacts between the Shieldex\u00ae 22/1 and \n\nShieldex\u00ae 117/17 yarns. The SIGP III material, compared to the SIGP II one, presents a better \n\nperformance, but its sheet resistance is still too high due to the few contacts between both \n\nconductive yarns.  \n\nFinally, the measured conductivity of the ground plane of SIGP I, which is 54 kS/m, agrees very \n\nwell with the result estimated through the measurement on the microstrip patch antenna, \n\nwhich is 50 kS/m, as reported in previous section. \n\n \n\n\n\n 104 \n\n \n\nFigure 8-7 SEM images of the conductive side of the Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane (a) SIGP I, \n(b) SIGP II and (c) SIGP III \n\n8.5 Validation of the Performance of SIGP \nTo validate the results obtained in previous section 8.4, a new microstrip patch antenna for \n\nenergy harvesting at ISM band (Industrial, Scientific and Medical), between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz, \n\nwas designed using the SIGP I as substrate and ground plane and the Pure copper polyester \n\ntaffeta fabric as patch. This bandwidth also serves to support to the services of WLAN, \n\nBluetooth, and among others. Figure 8-8 presents the design and the dimensions (mm) of this \n\nmicrostrip patch antenna. \n\n \nFigure 8-8 Microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at ISM band, dimensions in mm \n\nThis antenna was produced using the same manufacturing conditions as the antennas presented \n\nin previous 8.4.1. The microstrip patch antenna was tested using a VNA, at Instituto de \n\nTelecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro and Figure 8-9 presents the results. \n\n\n\n 105 \n\n \nFigure 8-9 S11 of the microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at ISM band \n\nAs one can see on Figure 8-9, the antenna shows a good impedance, validating so the results of \n\nthe electromagnetic characterisation presented in previous Subsections. The small shift \n\npresented on S11, as the simulated frequency is 2.42 GHz and the measured frequency is 2.40 \n\nGHz, is not significant and can be explained due to the inaccuracies on the manufacturing \n\nprocess, such as the gluing of the SMA connector.  \n\n8.6 Conclusions \nThis chapter presents the development and validation of a continuous Substrate Integrating the \n\nGround Plane (SIGP). The integration of the textile ground plane into the surface of the textile \n\nsubstrate, all in one fabric that has multiple layers, is the first step to the industrialization of \n\nthe textile microstrip patch antennas. The knitting spacer technologies, warp and weft \n\ntechnologies, are particularly suited for this propose as allow the production of thick fabrics \n\nwith different surfaces. The weft knitted spacer fabrics with an integrated conductive layer, \n\nherein developed and presented, have shown how promising is this approach. The SIGP I \n\npresented good dielectric and electrical properties, being thus suitable to be used for industrial \n\nfabrication and mass production of textile microstrip patch antennas and further smart clothing \n\nand wearables.  \n\nIn this Chapter the electrical properties of the spacer knitted fabrics were characterized using \n\nthe ASTM Standard F 1896. Also, the dielectric constant was characterized through the \n\nmicrostrip patch radiator method.  \n\nThree SIGP materials, which are weft knitted spacer fabrics, were developed using two types \n\nof conductive yarns. The SIGP I, made using a highly conductive yarn in which all filaments are \n\ncoated, shows the best conductivity result and best performance when tested on antenna. The \n\nSIGP II, made using a less conductive yarn in which only one plated monofilament is conductive, \n\nand the SIGP III, made with a mix of both yarns, are not conducting enough to be applied on \n\nantennas as the S11 results show. Despite the conductivity is too low for the requirement of \n\n\n\n 106 \n\nantennas, these weft knitted spacer fabrics are interesting materials as complement for other \n\napplications, such as electromagnetic shielding, textile switches and other interactive textiles. \n\nBeing cheaper materials, these SIGP II and III fabrics may complement other more expensive \n\nones and contribute thus to develop affordable smart clothing and wearables. \n\nThe integration of the ground plane on the surface of the substrate changes the dielectric \n\nproperties of the substrate material, increasing its dielectric constant value. This is mainly due \n\nto the decrease of the thickness of the substrate. Further, a microstrip patch antenna for \n\nenergy harvesting at ISM band was designed and manufactured using the novel knit material \n\nSIGP I. This antenna presented a great impedance adaptation, proving that the Substrate \n\nIntegrating the Ground Plane is suitable for the development of textile antennas. This result is \n\nvery promising for boosting the industrial fabrication of microstrip patch textile antennas and \n\ntheir mass production and dissemination into the IoT network, guiding future developments of \n\nsmart clothing and wearables.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 107 \n\n9 Chapter \n\n \n\nFinal Remarks \n\n \n\n9.1 General Conclusions \nIn the near future, the IoT developments will boost the use of garments which will not only \n\ncommunicate social conditions or protect the human body against the extremes of nature, but \n\nwill also provide information and communication tools, will also harvest energy to feed \n\nwearable systems. Clothes are becoming able to communicate wirelessly without the need of \n\nlarge and expensive equipment, neither the need of replacing batteries. This is possible \n\nbecause textile technologies can produce new types of flexible devices, such as antennas that \n\nare small, flexible and inexpensive and can thus be applied in different types of clothing, as \n\nwell as shoes and accessories. Textile antennas have thus been emerged to extend the \n\ninteraction ability of clothing, giving rise to the development of smart cloth. Furthermore, \n\nplanar antennas of the type microstrip patch are antennas secure to use in the vicinity of the \n\nbody as radiate perpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, \n\nensuring that the human body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. \n\nThis PhD Thesis focuses on the wearable textile antennas, giving an overview about the \n\ninfluence of the textile materials on the performance of textile microstrip patch antennas. \n\nSuch antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive (patch and ground plane) and \n\ndielectric (substrate) layers. For this reason, the knowledge about the electromagnetic \n\nproperties of textiles and about the assembly manufacturing techniques is crucial. Specific \n\nelectrical highly conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully \n\nused. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates and it is thus important to study \n\nand characterize their electromagnetic properties. Woven, knits and nonwovens are \n\ninhomogeneous, highly porous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental \n\nhygrometric conditions, making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there \n\nare no standard methods, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric \n\ncharacterization of textiles. Thus, this PhD thesis reviews the resonant and non-resonant \n\ntechniques that have been used to characterize the dielectric properties of textiles. Despite \n\nthe resonant techniques only characterize the material in a single frequency, for low-loss \n\nmaterials the resonant methods generally provide higher accuracy and sensibility than non-\n\nresonant ones. Some methods require a complex sample preparation, such as the methods of \n\ntransmission lines. Thus, the results obtained through this method can be influenced by the \n\n\n\n 108 \n\nconditions of some variables, as for example, the type of e-textile or conductive metal that is \n\nused, the used glue/adhesive sheet, the connector and the manufacturing technique to make \n\nthe probe. To alleviate the problems and complexity of the sample preparation and the \n\ninfluence of the conductive material on the dielectric characterization process, a new \n\nResonator-Based Experimental Technique was presented and performed. \n\nThis method is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation, which consists in computing the \n\nelectromagnetic parameters of the material under test, at a single frequency (2.25 GHz), by \n\nmeasuring the shift in the resonance frequency and in the value of the Q-factor of a microstrip \n\npatch antenna. Eleven textile materials were characterized and the results show differences in \n\nthe ?r values, when placing the face or reverse-side of textiles in contact with the resonator \n\nboard. These differences are due to the air gap between the surface of the material and the \n\nboard. Based on this observation, superficial properties of the textile materials were \n\ninvestigated. The results highlight that, as expected, the faces with higher surface roughness \n\nalso present the higher number of pores on the surface. This way, when characterizing textile \n\nfabrics with the resonator-based experimental technique, placing the faces of higher surface \n\nroughness in contact with the resonator board results in lower values of ?r. Also, the ?r \n\nexponentially decreases with the superficial porosity increase. Both of these observed facts \n\noccur because of the presence of the air on the surface, trapped in the superficial pores. \n\nDespite the measured value of the dielectric constant ?r differs when placing the face or \n\nreverse-sides in contact to the resonator board, and is thus influenced by the structure of the \n\nsurface of the MUT, the average value of ?r represents well the bulk material and may be \n\nconsidered when designing antennas. The observed superficial differences of the substrate do \n\nnot seem significant for the development of textile antennas, even when using substrates with \n\nclearly different faces.  \n\nEnergy harvesting can be a solution for powering battery-free devices, contributing to the \n\ngrowth of wireless wearable devices. In this context, the textile antennas are emerging as the \n\nsolution for feeding low-power devices and/or Wireless Sensors Body Networks, where the \n\nchange of batteries is not easy to perform. This PhD Thesis also presents a dual-band printed \n\nmonopole textile antenna which was developed on the scope of the PROENERGY PROJECT \u2013 \n\nPTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. It can be able to charge low-power devices, as well as extending \n\nthe lifetime of tiny devices by using electromagnetic energy harvested at GSM 900 and DSC \n\n1800. The printed monopole textile antenna was made using commercially available textiles, \n\nZelt\u00ae for the conductive parts and Cordura\u00ae as dielectric substrate. To improve the performance \n\nof this antenna, several manufacturing techniques were preliminary tested to identify \n\npromising techniques and to discard inefficient ones. The results of these tests allow to \n\nconclude that: \n\n\u2022 Coating technique: applying PU coating on Zelt\u00ae reduces significantly the conductivity of the \n\nconductor Zelt\u00ae material and the antenna does not work; \n\n\n\n 109 \n\n\u2022 Seam technique: can be considered since non-conductive threads are used to avoid short cuts \n\nbetween the patch and the ground plane and the conductive elements are hold and remain in \n\nthe conductive fabric; \n\n\u2022 Gluing technique: textile glue is not strong enough to completely assembly the conductive \n\nfabrics; \n\ndespite permanent glue and super glue work well, gluing is a problematic technique as it is \n\ndifficult to apply a controlled smooth and continuous coat of glue; \n\n\u2022 Laminating technique: in the laminating technique, a thin adhesive sheet most be used to \n\nminimise its interference on the permittivity of the dielectric material; \n\nthe presence of the glue of the adhesive sheet affects the sheet resistance of the conductive \n\nfabric and may decrease it; \n\nthe choice of a patterned adhesive sheet can minimize the discontinuity of the current flow \n\nand so preserve the conductivity; \n\nwhen the conductive material is assembled to the smoother face of the substrate, its sheet \n\nresistance increases due to the high number of contact points which cause discontinuities on \n\nthe electric current flow; \n\nthe ironing process without steam seems to be preferable as it better preserves the \n\nelectromagnetic performance of the materials; \n\nadditionally, a plain weave woven, such as Zelt\u00ae, shows that the orientation of the conductive \n\nfabric used for the patch does not influence the performance of the laminated antenna.  \n\n\u2022 Embroidery technique: is preferable to use stitches that are parallel to the feed line, to \n\nensure a continuous current flow; \n\nthe number of stitches in the embroidery may contribute to increase the conductivity of some \n\nelements, thus improving the performance of the antenna.  \n\nThe effective integration of wearable systems contributes to the advance of the IoT. Based on \n\nthe wearability guidelines, the innovative concept of producing textile antennas to integrate \n\ninto clothing by simply manipulating it as an \u201cemblem\u201d has emerged. This concept may improve \n\nthe usage of the wearable technologies. In the future, the wearable antennas might be \n\nincorporated into textile patterns and drawings, creating fashionable antennas. These \n\n\u201cemblem\u201d antennas may be easily acceded by the end user, for customization of smart cloth \n\nfor several applications.  \n\nThe E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat is the first prototype demonstrating this concept. \n\nIt integrates an \u201cemblem\u201d version of the presented printed monopole textile antenna for \n\nenergy harvesting. In the E-caption, the antenna is manufactured directly on the clothing, \n\nhaving a continuous dielectric substrate made with the textile materials composing the coat. \n\nTherefore, it is shown that a continuous substrate of the antenna does not influence its \n\nperformance. Moreover, the results show that, despite the masses of the coat and of the body \n\ninfluence the radiation characteristic of the integrated antenna, the antenna still shows a \n\nnearly omnidirectional radiation pattern. \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nIn order to contribute to the industrialization of textile antennas, based on the results obtained, \n\na new continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane was developed (SIGP). It is a novel \n\ntextile material, which is a double fabric that integrates the dielectric substrate and the \n\nconductive ground plane in a single textile, eliminating thus one laminating step in the \n\nmanufacturing process of microstrip patch antennas. In this thesis, three SIGP were produced \n\nusing two types of conductive yarns, being one a highly conductive yarn well suitable for the \n\ndesign of antennas: \n\n\u2022 SIGP I - made using a highly conductive yarn in which all filaments are coated, shows as \n\nexpected the best conductivity result and best performance when tested on antenna; \n\n\u2022 SIGP II - made using a less conductive yarn in which only one plated monofilament is \n\nconductive; \n\n\u2022 SIGP III - made with a mix of both yarns, it is not conducting enough to be applied on antennas \n\nas the S11 results show.  \n\nDespite SIGP II and III present too low conductivity for the requirement of antennas, these weft \n\nknitted spacer fabrics are interesting materials as complement for other functionalities, such \n\nas electromagnetic shielding, textile switches and other interactive textiles. Being cheaper \n\nmaterials, these SIGP II and III fabrics may complement other more expensive ones and \n\ncontribute thus to develop affordable smart clothing and wearables. \n\nTo characterize the dielectric properties of SIGP I, the microstrip resonator patch technique \n\nwas used. The results show that the integration of the ground plane on the surface of the \n\nsubstrate changes the dielectric properties of the substrate material, increasing its dielectric \n\nconstant value, ?r. This is mainly due to the decrease of the thickness of the substrate.  \n\nFurther, a microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at 2.45 GHz was designed and \n\nmanufactured using the SIGP I. This antenna presents a great impedance adaptation, proving \n\nthat the substrate integrating the ground plane (SIGP) is suitable on the development of textile \n\nantennas. Finally, the integration of the ground plane in the substrate, fabricated through an \n\nindustrial process, may boost the industrial fabrication of microstrip patch textile antennas and \n\ntheir mass production. The SIGP associated with the \u201cemblem\u201d antenna concept are important \n\ncontributions giving novel guidelines for the advance of the integration of electronic devices in \n\nless obtrusive ways. \n\n9.2 Future Works \nThis PhD thesis has established guidelines to integrate antennas into clothing that rise new \n\napproaches for developing smart clothing. It would be interesting to continue the work of this \n\nPhD Thesis, merging fashion design to textile engineering in order to create functional and \n\nfashionable smart clothing which includes antennas. Having these double formations, this is an \n\nongoing research for me and the opportunity to undertake business actions.  \n\n\n\n 111 \n\nThus, a new version of E-Caption coat is already under development, as one can see in Appendix \n\nE. The E-Caption 2.0 \u2013 Smart and Safety Coat, is a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) \n\ndeveloped to warning the tower climbers to the radiation level exposure. As the first version \n\nof E-Caption, this coat will be a proof-of-concept of the textile antennas used for energy \n\nharvesting. \n\nUntil now, the tower climbers carry a portable radiation monitor for exposure to RF and non-\n\nionizing radiation, that has a LED display, alarm and vibration notifications. Despite the great \n\nperformance of this equipment, it is typically heavy, big (about 200 mm x 150 mm) and \n\nexpensive (between $599.00 and $2.500).  \n\nThe E-Caption 2.0 is made using the continuous SIGP III in order to protect the tower climbers \n\nby shielding the RF radiation. Also, the left front side will be made using the SIGP I, integrating \n\na textile RF harvest system manufactured directly on the SIGP. This development is based on \n\nthe System-on-Substrate (SoS) concept [152], [153], where every part of the system is placed \n\non the same substrate. Furthermore, several LED\u2019s will be placed in this front of the coat to \n\nwarning the user for the radiation levels.  \n\nThe analysis and study of this prototype may go deeper in diverse scientific subjects. After \n\nfinishing the manufacturing process of E-Caption 2.0, measurements of S11 and radiation pattern \n\nof the textile antenna, on free space and on-body, should be performed. Also, the efficiency \n\nand wearability of the system may be tested. It would be interesting to analyse the washing \n\nconditions in order to test the stability of the antenna, and establish the wear and maintenance \n\nconditions of the SIGP and the assemblies performed. Further, tests of Specific Absorption Rate \n\n(SAR) may be performed to measure if and how much energy the body absorb from the harvest \n\nsystem and to characterise the shielding efficiency of SIGP II.  \n\nThis new coat is expected to contribute for the advance of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) \n\nfor tower climbers. The E-Caption 2.0 will be able to disseminate the applicability of textile \n\nantennas for energy harvesting into clothing, also contributing to the development of wearable \n\nwireless devices and smart clothing aiming to reach the specific market of PPE 7.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n                                                   \n7 Appendix F. \n\n\n\n 112 \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n[1] H.

The fundamental parameters of antennas are summarily described in this appendix, \n\nto support the reading of the thesis. All descriptions of the parameters are based on the IEEE \n\nStandard Definitions of Terms for Antennas. A more in-depth information and description is \n\ngiven in [8], [154]. \n\nA.1 Evaluation of Antennas  \n\nAlong this PhD Thesis, the performance of the antennas will be evaluated through their S11 \n\nparameter and radiation pattern. The S11 parameter is one of the Scattering parameters (S-) \n\nthat describes the input-output relationship between ports, or terminals, in an electrical \n\nsystem. The S11 defines the relationship between the injected signal into the antenna and the \n\nreflected signal, hence is known as the return loss. The reflection of the injected signal occurs \n\ndue to the mismatch of impedances. A minimum return loss is reached when there is a perfect \n\nadaptation of the impedance of the antenna. The S11 is measured using a Vector Analyser \n\nNetwork (VNA), which is an instrument that measures the network parameters of electrical \n\nnetworks. The VNA measures both amplitude and phase properties of networks. Figure A-1 \n\npresents an example of a VNA measuring the return loss of a textile antenna, at the Department \n\nof Technology Information at Ghent University, in Belgium.  \n\nThe radiation pattern is the spatial distribution of a quantity that characterizes the \n\nelectromagnetic field generated by an antenna. This distribution can be expressed as a \n\nmathematical function or as a graphical representation. The quantities that are most often \n\nused to characterize the radiation from an antenna are proportional to or equal to power flux \n\ndensity, radiation intensity, directivity, phase, polarization, and field strength. \n\nAlso, the radiation pattern is measured at the anechoic chamber. It is a room designed to \n\ncompletely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. It is also often isolated \n\nfrom waves entering from its surroundings. Figure A-2 shows an example of an anechoic \n\nchamber at Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2013 Aveiro. \n\n\n\n 126 \n\n \nFigure A-1 Vector Network Analyser \u2013 Department of Technology Information at Ghent University \n\n \nFigure A-2 Anechoic chamber at Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es - Aveiro \n\nA.2 Parameters of antennas \n\nInput Impedance - The input impedance of an antenna is presented by an antenna at its \n\nterminals. The input impedance is the ratio between the voltage and the input current. Usually, \n\nhas a real part associated with the radiated power and the dissipated power in the antenna, \n\nand an imaginary part constituted by the reactive power stored around the antenna. This \n\nparameter is defined by the geometry and the way to feed the antenna. Typically, the antennas \n\nand RF circuits are designed to have an input impedance of 50 ?. Also, the impedance mismatch \n\n\n\n 127 \n\nfactor is associated with the Scattering parameters (S-) explained in A.1, and is defined by the \n\nratio of the power accepted by an antenna to the power incident at the antenna\u2019s terminals \n\nfrom the transmitter.  \n\nBandwidth \u2013 Is the range of frequencies within which the performance of the antenna conforms \n\nto a specified standard with respect to some characteristic. In the case of planar antennas, \n\nsuch as the ones presented in this thesis, the typical bandwidth can be defined as the range of \n\nfrequencies which return loss is less than one tenth of the injected signal into the antenna. \n\nThat is, all frequencies whose value of the S11 parameter is below -10dB. \n\nResonance Frequency - A frequency at which the input impedance of an antenna is \n\nnonreactive.  \n\nDirectivity - The ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from the antenna to the \n\nradiation intensity averaged over all directions.?If the direction is not specified, the direction \n\nof maximum radiation intensity is implied.  \n\nGain - Although the gain of the antenna is closely related to the directivity, it is a measure that \n\ntakes into account the efficiency of the antenna as well as its directional capabilities. Gain of \n\nthe antenna is defined by the ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction to the radiation \n\nintensity that would be produced if the power accepted by the antenna were isotropically \n\nradiated. Also, If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity is \n\nimplied.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 128 \n\n\n\n 129 \n\nAppendix B \n\n \n\nMeasurements of the Permittivity of Textiles \n\n \n\nTable A-1 presents all permittivity measured values. In the column named \u2018measurement file\u2019, \n\nit is possible to see the date of the measurement, name of the material, number of sample, \n\nside in contact with the resonator board (S1 \u2013 face side and S2 reverse side), and which direction \n\nof the sample was aligned with the feed point on antenna, following the scheme presented in \n\nFigure 4-4. \n\nTable B-1 Compilation of permittivity measurements \n\nMaterial ?r tan?

Also, cork is an emblematic material of \n\nPortugal, being this STSM a great opportunity to explore other applications for it. Further, on \n\nthe past decade, several fashion products were emerged using cork materials. \n\nFive cork sheet materials were characterized using the Resonator-Based Experimental Method, \n\nfollowing the procedure presented on Chapter 4, at 2.25 GHz. Table B-1 presents the average \n\nvalues of measured permittivity and the characteristics of the tested corks. Thickness was \n\ncharacterized using Kawabata\u2019s Evaluation System for Fabrics, KES \u2013 3 Compressional Tester, \n\nat UBI.  \n\nTable C-1 Description of cork materials characterized at 2.25 GHz \n\nSample Material Manufacturer \nManufacturer \n\nreference \nComposition \n\nThickness \n(mm) ?r tan? \n\nCork 1 Cork composite \n\nCorticeira \nAmorim \n\n8822 \n100% cork 3 1.30 0.005 \n\nCork 2 Cork composite 100% cork 2.5 1.26 0.009 \nCork 3 Cork composite 100% cork 1.5 1.17 0.005 \n\nCorktex \nSynthetic \nleather \n\n8245 L 100% cork 1 1.29 0.006 \n\nCorktex \nPES \n\nCork fabric 8245 T \n100% cork, one side laminated \n\nwith plain weave 100% PES \n1.1 1.35 0.006 \n\n \n\nC.2 Validation \n\nIn order to validate the results, a coaxial antenna to resonate at 2.45 GHz, using cork 3 as \n\ndielectric substrate, was designed. For the conductive parts, Pure copper taffeta fabric (Less \n\nEMF Inc., Latham, USA), with sheet resistance = 0.05 ?/? and thickness equal to 0.080 mm, \nwas used. The antenna was assembled using the Adhesive Sheet II (see Table 6-4). Figure C-1 \n\n\n\n 134 \n\npresents the design and dimensions of the coaxial cork antenna, and Figure C-2 shows the \n\nmeasured return loss. \n\n \n\nFigure C-1 Design and dimensions of coaxial cork antenna for 2.45 GHz \n\n \n\n \nFigure C-2 Measured S11 of coaxial cork antenna \n\nBased on the return loss parameter presented in Figure B-2, one may observe the measured \n\ncoaxial cork antenna works well at 2.44 GHz, that is in agreement with the simulated resonance \n\nfrequency (2.45 GHz). Further, one may conclude that the Resonator-Based Experimental \n\nTechnique is also suitable to characterize the permittivity of other planar materials, at 2.25 \n\nGHz, such as cork composites.   \n\nC.3 Experiments at 5 GHz  \n\nDuring the STSM, cork 3 was also characterized, using the Resonator-Based Experimental \n\nTechnique, at 5 GHz. The obtained average values were ?r = 1,3571 and tan? = 0,0089.  \n\n\n\n 135 \n\nIn order to validate these results, two coaxial antennas, with the same dimensions (see Figure \n\nB-3) were manufactured using the Copper taffeta fabric for the conductive parts, feed by a \n\nSMA connector. The antennas were designed to resonate at 5 GHz and Figure B-4 shows the \n\nmeasured S11. \n\n \n\nFigure C-3 Design and dimensions of coaxial cork antenna for 5 GHz (a) front (b) rear \n\n \n\n \nFigure C-4 Measured return loss of coaxial cork antennas (prototype 1 \u2013 red line and prototype 2, blue \n\nline) \n\nAs one can see on Figure B-4, the manufactured antennas presented very different results, and \n\nthus the obtained ?r values do not well characterize the material. At this frequency, 5 GHz, the \n\ncork composite has shown an instable electromagnetic behaviour, and due to the naturally high \n\nsuperficial porosity of cork, it is not compatible to the Resonator-Based Experimental \n\nTechnique. \n\nFurther, cork 3 was characterize at 5 GHz, using the method explained on [155] and the an \n\nantenna combining cork substrate and conductive fabric was designed and published in [70].\n\n\n\n 136 \n\n\n\n 137 \n\nAppendix D \n\n \n\nPreliminary Tests of Integration of Textile Antenna \n\non Cloth \n\n \n\nThe first experiment to integrate a textile antenna on cloth was performed at Ghent University, \n\nduring the STSM reference IC1301-18709. A miniaturised textile antenna was made using the \n\nSubstrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technique. This Quarter-Mode wearable antenna has a \n\ncompact dimension, and has been excellent for off-body communications. Also, this antenna is \n\nan adaptation of the wearable antenna presented in [67], using protective foam as dielectric \n\nsubstrate.  \n\nIn this version, 3D fabric II is used for the substrate and Pure copper taffeta fabric is uded for \n\nthe conductive parts. The antenna was assembled using the Adhesive Sheet II. The waveguides \n\nwere hand made using manual embroidering technique [152], with Silverpam conductive yarn \n\n(see Table 6-7) . The antenna was designed for 2.4 GHz ISM band. Figure D-1 shows the Quarter-\n\nMode SIW textile antenna.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure D-1 Quarter-Mode SIW textile antenna \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n 138 \n\nDue to the small size of the antenna, a glove was designed to integrate this antenna. In order \n\nto facilitate the measurements, a front pocket was created to place the antenna. Also, a \n\nstructure using Styrofoam was made to stabilise the glove during the measurements, as one can \n\nsee on Figure D-2.  \n\n \n(a)                                                                   (b) \n\nFigure D-2 Styrofoam support to stabilise the glove during the measurements. In (a) antenna stand-\nalone (b) on the glove \n\nFor the first time, the results between a stand-alone and integrated antenna were compared. \n\nFigure D-3 presents the measured return loss and Figure D-4 shows the 3D radiation pattern. \n\nBoth measurements were performed in the anechoic chamber on Department of Technology \n\nInformation at Ghent University. \n\n \nFigure D-3  Measured S11 of Quarter-Mode SIW textile antenna (a) stand-alone \u2013 red line, and (b) on \n\nglove \u2013 blue line \n\n\n\n 139 \n\n \nFigure D-4 3D radiation pattern of Quarter-Mode SIW textile antenna (a) stand-alone and (b) on glove \n\nAs one can see in Figures D-3 the integration process does not influence the performance of \n\nthe antenna. In fact, both measurements gave similar results, both antennas work at 2.52 GHz, \n\ncovering the ISM band, and the efficiency of the antenna is 0.5026 for the stand-alone, and \n\n0.5056 for the integrated antenna. Also,  observing Figure D-4, is possible see that the radiation \n\npattern still being clearly omnidirectional even after the integration on the glove.\n\n\n\n 140 \n\n\n\n 141 \n\nAppendix E \n\n \n\nE-Caption on Television Show \n\n \n\nE-Caption coat was presented in the television show called \u201cH\u00e1 Volta on RTP TV\u201d, during the \n\n\u201cVolta a Portugal de Ciclismo\u201d (Cycling Tour of Portugal), in 02 of August of 2016.
