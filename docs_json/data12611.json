Al\u00e9m disso, condicionado pela \nvasta extens\u00e3o do oceano aberto, o conhecimento da fase inicial de vida das \nlarvas pel\u00e1gicas \u00e9 ainda relativamente limitado. Em esp\u00e9cies de dec\u00e1podes \nbento-pel\u00e1gicos, a transi\u00e7\u00e3o da vida no fundo do mar para a coluna de \u00e1gua \nn\u00e3o s\u00f3 est\u00e1 associada a uma metamorfose dr\u00e1stica na morfologia, mas \ntamb\u00e9m a uma mudan\u00e7a de comportamento e de ecologia alimentar. O \npresente trabalho teve como objectivo principal investigar as adapta\u00e7\u00f5es \nfisiol\u00f3gicas, bioqu\u00edmicas e comportamentais que ocorrem durante o \ndesenvolvimento inicial em esp\u00e9cies de dec\u00e1podes bento-pel\u00e1gicos. Como \norganismos modelos foram usados o lagostim, Nephrops norvegicus, e o \ncaranguejo Monodaeus couchi, pelo facto de ambas as esp\u00e9cies poderem ser \ncapturadas ao largo da plataforma do NE Atl\u00e2ntico e a mais de 300 m de \nprofundidade.  \n\nO Cap\u00edtulo 1 apresenta os desafios enfrentados pelos adultos e larvas de \ndec\u00e1podes que vivem nestes ambientes remotos, incluindo o efeito da \ndisponibilidade de alimento no desenvolvimento, e dos processos \noceanogr\u00e1ficos na dispers\u00e3o e recrutamento. Em particular, este trabalho \npretende seguir a hist\u00f3ria de vida inicial, a come\u00e7ar com a variabilidade na \ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00e1cidos gordos (AG) de embri\u00f5es da mesma ninhada de N. \nnorvegicus em desenvolvimento. Na maioria das f\u00eameas, n\u00e3o foram \nencontradas diferen\u00e7as na composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos AG de embri\u00f5es alojados em \nambos os lados da c\u00e2mara de desenvolvimento embrion\u00e1ria. No entanto, todas \nas f\u00eameas apresentaram diferen\u00e7as significativas nos perfis de AG de \nembri\u00f5es situados em diferentes ple\u00f3podes. Poss\u00edveis causas para as \nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es registadas podem ser devidas ao investimento diferencial da f\u00eamea \ndurante a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ov\u00f3citos ou a mudan\u00e7as no catabolismo dos AG \ndurante o per\u00edodo de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o promovido pela localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do embri\u00e3o dentro \nda c\u00e2mara de desenvolvimento embrion\u00e1ria. Em seguida foram investigadas \nem N. norvegicus as taxas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e a actividade de enzimas \ndigestivas dos primeiros dois est\u00e1dios larvares. Ambos os est\u00e1dios foram \ncapazes de maximizar a ingest\u00e3o de alimento em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de escassez de \npresas, e mostraram um aumento na taxa de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o depois de per\u00edodos \nde inani\u00e7\u00e3o. A actividade da amilase indicou que os hidratos de carbono n\u00e3o \ns\u00e3o a principal reserva de energia e que a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser obrigat\u00f3ria \n\nlogo ap\u00f3s a eclos\u00e3o para iniciar a actividade da amilase. A actividade da \nprotease indicou que as reservas de prote\u00ednas s\u00e3o metabolizadas em inani\u00e7\u00e3o. \nEstes resultados indicam que na presen\u00e7a de maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de \npl\u00e2ncton as larvas podem maximizar a ingest\u00e3o de presas e minimizar os \nefeitos prejudiciais provocados por intermitentes per\u00edodos pr\u00e9vios de fome, \nbaixa densidade de presas, ou presas impr\u00f3prias. Al\u00e9m disso, a mudan\u00e7a na \nactividade enzim\u00e1tica pode permitir \u00e0s larvas rec\u00e9m-nascidas de N. norvegicus \nmetabolizar as reservas de prote\u00ednas para sobreviver a curtos per\u00edodos de \ninani\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nDe seguida foi estudado a influ\u00eancia das propriedades oceanogr\u00e1ficas sobre a \nmigra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical das larvas. Em M. couchi, todos os est\u00e1dios larvares \napresentaram migra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical nocturna inversa. A abund\u00e2ncia dos dois \nprimeiros est\u00e1dios mostrou estar positivamente correlacionada com os n\u00edveis \nde clorofila a. A ocorr\u00eancia de mudan\u00e7a ontog\u00e9nica na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical \nexplicou os resultados; os primeiros est\u00e1dios de zoeae permanecem na parte \nsuperior da coluna de \u00e1gua, uma zona rica em alimentos, ao contr\u00e1rio dos \nest\u00e1dios posteriores que migraram para o fundo de forma a assentarem.

Additionally, due to the vastness of the \nopen ocean, knowledge of early life histories of pelagic larvae is still relatively \nscarce. In decapod species with bentho-pelagic lifestyle, the transition from life \nin the seafloor to the water column not only is associated with drastic \nmorphological metamorphosis, but also with changes in behavior and feeding \necology. The purpose of the present thesis was to investigate physiological, \nbiochemical and behavioral adaptation occurring during early development of \nsuch species. The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and the crab \nMonodaeus couchi were used as a model as these two species are \nencountered off the NE Atlantic shelf at depth greater than 300 m.  \n\nChapter 1 introduces the challenges faced by both adult and larvae inhabiting \nsuch remote habitats, including the effect of food availability on development \nand oceanographic processes on dispersal and recruitment. The thesis follows \nearly life histories, starting with within-brood variability in the fatty acid (FA) \nprofile displayed by developing N. norvegicus embryos. There were no \ndifferences in the FA composition of embryos sampled from both sides of the \nbrooding chamber in most females. However, all females exhibited significant \ndifferences in the FA profiles of embryos sampled from different pleopods. \nPotential causes for the variations recorded may be differential female \ninvestment during oocyte production or shifts in FA catabolism during the \nincubation period promoted by embryo\u2019s location within the brooding chamber. \nNext, feeding rates and digestive enzymes activity of the early stage larvae was \ninvestigated in N. norvegicus. Both stages were able to maximize food intake \nwhen larvae were scarce and showed increased feeding rate following periods \nof starvation. Amylase activity indicated that carbohydrates are not the primary \nenergy reserve and that feeding may be required soon after hatching to trigger \namylase activity. Protease activity indicated that protein reserves are \ncatabolized under starvation. These results indicate that larvae may maximize \nprey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher food abundance \nand minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of intermittent \nstarvation or unsuitable prey densities/types.  \n\nAdditionally, changes in enzymatic activity may allow newly hatched N. \nnorvegicus larvae to metabolize protein reserves to overcome short-term \nstarvation. Vertical migration behavior and the influence of oceanographic \nproperties were studied next. All zoeal stages of M. couchi displayed reverse \ndiel vertical migration. Abundance of early stages was correlated with \nchlorophyll a levels. An ontogenic shift in vertical distribution explained the \nresults; earlier zoeal stages remain in the food-rich upper water column while \nlater stages migrate to the bottom for settlement. This vertical migration \nbehavior is likely to affect horizontal distribution of larvae. Indeed, global \ncurrent patterns will result in low inter-annual variations in decapod larvae \nrecruitment, but short term variations such as upwelling events will cause \ndeviation from the expected dispersal pattern.  \n\nThroughout development, from the embryo to metamorphosis into benthic \njuvenile, offshore decapods face many challenges. For the developing \nindividual survivorship will depend heavily on food availability but also on the \nreserves passed on by the mother. Even though vertical migration behavior can \nallow the larvae to take advantage of depth varying currents for transport, the \neffect of general circulation pattern will superimpose local current and influence \nfeeding conditions and affect dispersal and recruitment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable of Content  \n\n \n\n1 General Introduction

are important phases of decapod crustaceans life cycle. It \n\nis widely accepted that pre-settlement processes have an important impact on \n\nmetamorphosis and survival of post-larvae and juveniles (Gim\u00e9nez 2010). Until \n\nrecently, most studies focused separately either larval or post settlement processes. \n\nHowever, as stressed by Pechenik (2006), metamorphosis should not be considered as \n\na new beginning. A carry-over effect from earlier larval history will affect post-\n\nsettlement performance of newly settled juvenile (Gim\u00e9nez 2006). Similarly, the \n\nquality of maternal investment into the embryo or variations in environmental \n\nconditions during embryonic development will ultimately affect larval development \n\nand survival (Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2003). Many studies have documented the existence \n\nof inter-population differences in embryonic and larval development (e.g.: Bas et al. \n\n2007; Kunisch and Anger 1984; Ouellet and Plante 2004; Rotllant et al. 2004). For \n\ninstance, in species with a wide distribution, geographic differences in environmental \n\nconditions strongly influences early life history processes (Brante et al. 2003; Rotllant \n\net al. 2004).  Similarly, species displaying extended reproductive seasons and/or \n\noccupying habitats exposed to strong environmental gradients may experience \n\nvariations in food availability, temperature and/or salinity, which may result in intra- \n\nand inter-population variability in the energetic content of embryos and newly hatched \n\nlarvae (e.g.: Brante et al. 2003; Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2003; Kunisch and Anger 1984; \n\nTuck et al. 2000; Ver\u00edsimo et al. 2011). On smaller spatial scales, local environmental \n\nconditions might not be identical for all developing siblings and as a result, within-\n\nbrood variability will be observed. In this sense, an increased within-clutch variability \n\ncan reduce the variation in reproductive success among generations, by ensuring that \n\nat least some offspring are likely to have the suitable phenotype for the local \n\nenvironment (Crean and Marshall 2009).  \n\nThe extent to which latent effects of embryonic and/or larval development regulate \n\nthe populations of coastal invertebrates is still largely unknown (Pechenik 2006). \n\nNevertheless, as stated above, within-brood variability resulting from differential \n\nmaternal investment into embryonic reserves or larval experience will affect larval \n\nprocesses and/or metamorphosis. Because of the critical role played by the larval \n\nphase in dispersal, factors affecting larval traits will impact recruitment and therefore \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n10 \n\naffect population dynamics (Gim\u00e9nez 2006, 2010). The purpose of this thesis was to \n\ninvestigate early life history processes of offshore benthic decapods: 1) document \n\ninter-individual and within-brood variability in embryonic reserves, 2) investigate early \n\nlarval behavioral and physiological responses to changes in food quality and quantities, \n\nand 3) describe larval migratory behaviors and dispersal. Two species were used in this \n\nthesis to serve as models for offshore benthic Pleocyemata decapods, the Norway \n\nlobster Nephrops norvegicus and the xanthid crab Monodaeus couchi. \n\nIn this chapter it will be identified where, in the life cycle of benthic decapod, \n\ndifferences in environmental conditions might result in within-brood variability in early \n\nlife development and survival. A summary of current knowledge about the \n\nreproductive and early life history of offshore benthic decapod species is given. \n\nChallenges faced by females will be briefly overviewed, focusing on phases playing a \n\ncrucial role in the reproduction process, mainly ovogenesis. Essential factors for \n\nsuccessful larval development to juvenile, such as embryonic reserves, environmental \n\nconditions and food quality and quantity, as well as, recruitment and settlement \n\nprocesses, will also be assessed. Finally, the biology and ecology of the two model \n\nspecies will be briefly reviewed. \n\n \n\n1.1 Ovarian and embryonic development in benthic offshore \n\nPleocyemata decapods  \n\nDue to the difficulties existing in sampling the benthic offshore environment, the \n\ncurrent knowledge on the biology of species from this habitat is far from complete. \n\nExcept for chemoautotrophic processes taking place at hydrothermal vents and cold \n\nseeps (Gage and Tyler 1991), owing to the lack of sunlight on the sea floor of the open \n\nocean and, therefore photosynthesis, food is provided to the benthic community \n\nthrough sedimentation from upper layers. As a result, the availability of food resources \n\nfor the deep benthos largely depends on the flux of particulate organic carbon from \n\nthe epipelagic zone, although there are time lags involved (Company et al. 2003; \n\nFanelli and Cartes 2004; Johnson et al. 2007). Consequently, the majority of the \n\noffshore benthic species are deposit feeders, or complete their predator diet through \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n11 \n\nscavenging. Chitinous exoskeleton shed by planktonic organisms represent a reliable, \n\nconstant food sources (Johnson et al. 2007), while carcasses of larger organism such as \n\nsquids or whales constitute a large but sporadic supply of lipids and proteins (Kemp et \n\nal. 2006).  Nevertheless, on the way down, sinking particles, mostly originating from \n\nplant or animal (e.g.: feces, dead individual, molt, etc\u2026), are grazed upon by pelagic \n\nscavengers and therefore lose much of their nutritive qualities before reaching the \n\nbenthos, a loss that increases proportionally with increasing depth (Gage and Tyler \n\n1991). Food is therefore the most limiting factor for secondary production in this \n\nenvironment (Stockton and DeLaca 1982).  \n\nMany adult decapods have a benthic existence. Those that live further offshore will \n\ntherefore live deeper and face many challenges related to the deep sea environment. \n\nAs discussed above, food is the most limiting factor for organisms inhabiting offshore \n\nbenthic habitats (Gage and Tyler 1991; Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). Unlike \n\ndecapod species from shallow waters, offshore species cannot rely solely on predation \n\nfor survival and most are expected to display primarily a scavenging lifestyle (Fanelli \n\nand Cartes 2004). Nevertheless, dietary habits are fairly unknown due to the \n\ndifficulties of sampling, either through direct observations or stomach content \n\nanalysis, as the gastric mill of decapod generally grinds preys beyond identification \n\n(Gage and Tyler 1991). Additionally, food availability is bound to influence the biology \n\nof offshore benthic species, especially during the critical periods of their life history \n\n(e.g. molt, gamete production, egg incubation\u2026). Indeed, the synchrony between the \n\nreproductive cycle and seasonal phytoplankton blooms in surface waters has already \n\nbeen documented in deep-sea decapods (Copley and Young 2006; Hilario et al. 2009; \n\nPerovich et al. 2003). Additionally, shifts in food resources influencing growth have \n\nbeen shown to affect ovarian composition as well (Tuck et al. 1997b).  \n\nPlasticity in maternal investment is often illustrated by the variability observed in inter-\n\nindividual and/or within-brood egg size (e.g.: Bas et al. 2007; Briones-Fourzan et al. \n\n2009), which, despite some small limitations, can ultimately be used to assess \n\nembryonic energetic input by the female (Moran and McAlister 2009). In the \n\nPleocyemata, egg production is as follows: vitellogenesis is divided into two phases; \n\nfirst yolk is deposited slowly into the oocytes which gradually increase in size; second, \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n12 \n\nlarge amount of yolk is deposited in the oocytes over a short period of time. The \n\nquality of nutrients deposited into the developing oocyte during this second phase is \n\nmore likely to be affected by the feeding status of the female. Besides the ovaries, \n\nnutrients used during vitellogenesis in decapod can originate from various sources, \n\nincluding the hepatopancreas, hemocytes and subepidermal adipose tissue (Talbot and \n\nHelluy 1995). After ovulation, the mature oocytes are spawned and fertilized either \n\ninternally or externally depending on the species. After fertilization, embryos become \n\nattached to the ovigerous setae of female\u2019s pleopods until their development is \n\ncomplete and hatching occurs. During that period, the female cares for the embryos by \n\nfanning the pleopods, bringing water and thus fresh oxygen to the egg mass. Parasites, \n\nas well as unhealthy and dead eggs, are also periodically removed through grooming.  \n\nIn marine invertebrates, maternal investment is a major factor in shaping population \n\nstructure and dynamics (Hammerschmidt et al. 2011; Marshall and Keough 2008). \n\nBecause embryonic development in decapods is completely lecithotrophic (Anger \n\n2001), the quality and quantity of embryonic reserves provided by females are critical \n\nand impact development, hatching and early larval survival (Gim\u00e9nez 2006). The \n\nresources available to the embryo are those that have been provided by the female, \n\nwhich are influenced by the maternal diet prior to ovogenesis (Racotta et al. 2003). As \n\na result,  gonadal maturation in decapods has large associated energy costs (Rosa and \n\nNunes 2002). By understanding the biochemical shifts occurring during embryonic \n\ndevelopment, it is possible to identify the nutritional requirements exhibited by \n\ndeveloping embryos. Additionally, changes in nutrient allocation may help understand \n\nhow within-brood variability will ultimately affect larval survival. Proteins are known to \n\nbe the main components of marine invertebrate eggs (Holland 1978). However, lipids \n\nplay a central role in the embryonic metabolism, since they represent the most \n\nimportant energy source and form at least 60% of the total energy expenditure of \n\ndeveloping crustacean embryos (Wehrtmann and Graeve 1998). Nevertheless, for \n\nplanktotrophic larvae in the open ocean, food may not be available right after hatching \n\nand, when facing starvation, the only energetic reserves allowing survival are of \n\nembryonic origin (Anger 2001; Rotllant et al. 2001). In this sense, the quantity and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n13 \n\nquality of nutrients remaining from embryonic development will highly influence larval \n\ndevelopment and survival, and ultimately affect population dynamics.  \n\nAlternatively, differences in environmental conditions within the brooding chamber \n\nmay promote a shift in nutrient consumption during the incubation period. Variable \n\noxygen concentration within the dense embryo mass has already been described for \n\nbrachyuran crabs (Fernandez et al. 2003). Embryonic metabolic rates commonly \n\nincrease in reduced oxygen environment and yolk reserves provided by the female are \n\ndepleted at a faster rate (Brante et al. 2003). This scenario will cause a differential \n\ncatabolism of embryonic reserves and eventually lead to asynchronous larval hatching \n\n(Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). Indeed, decapods have been recorded to \n\nhatch their larvae over several consecutive nights (Pandian 1970). These episodes were \n\noften considered as a \u201claboratorial artifact\u201d. Nevertheless, regardless of the proximate \n\ncause, within-brood variation in embryonic nutrients may result in asynchronous \n\nembryonic development, and may ultimately result in asynchronous hatching of larvae \n\nwith variable nutritional reserves (Wickins et al. 1995). This variability at birth will, in \n\nturn, affect larval success in recruitment to suitable juvenile habitat.  \n\n1.2 Life history processes of Pleocyemata decapod larvae in offshore \n\nenvironments \n\nDue to its harsh environmental conditions and patchy food distribution, the open \n\nocean habitat is not optimal for larval development (Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2005). In \n\noffshore benthic decapods, the depth where larval hatching takes place may also play \n\na role in food availability. In larvae hatching below the photic zone, prey items may not \n\nbe sufficient to fulfill the nutritional needs of the first larvae stage. In fact, it is possible \n\nthat suitable prey may only be available once these larvae reach the upper regions of \n\nthe water column (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). After hatching, decapod larvae are \n\nknown to migrate vertically to the photic zone (Queiroga and Blanton 2005). This \n\naspect of decapod\u2019s early life cycle may translate into a potential period of suboptimal \n\nfeeding, or even post-hatching starvation. Following the first vertical migration, natural \n\npatchiness of the pelagic environment will result in variable food conditions (Andersen \n\nand Nielsen 2002; Folt and Burns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995) and feeding larvae have \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n14 \n\nevolved mechanisms allowing them to cope with those trophic mismatches which will \n\nbe discussed below.  \n\nAfter a period of lecithotrophic embryonic development, the eggs of decapods will \n\nhatch into free-swimming larvae. Species of deep sea habitats tend to invest more \n\nenergy into each individual embryo, and therefore tend to produce a smaller number \n\nof larger eggs (Anger 2001; Gage and Tyler 1991). The number of molts necessary to \n\nreach post larval stage greatly varies intra-specifically but again the number of larval \n\nstage and larval duration have the tendency to decrease with increasing depth of adult \n\nhabitat (Anger 2001). Additionally, the dependence on food will also decrease with \n\ndepth. These strategies will translate into reduced mortality and increased recruitment \n\nand settlement success (Gage and Tyler 1991). \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Feeding \n\nRegardless of larval geographical range or hatching period, it is widely accepted that \n\nplanktonic larvae are naturally subjected to intermittent periods of starvation and/or \n\nsuboptimal prey availability due to the natural patchiness of plankton distribution in \n\nthe oceanic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; Folt and Burns 1999; Pinel-\n\nAlloul 1995). Studies have highlighted how, in decapods, early larval feeding greatly \n\naffects their development, since these organisms may not recover from extended \n\nperiod of nutritional stress even after feeding resumes (e.g.: Anger et al. 1985; Calado \n\net al. 2010; Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2005; Pechenik 2006; Rotllant et al. 2001). The larvae \n\nof species hatching  in regions of low food availability have developed morphological \n\n(Fenaux et al. 1994; Strathmann et al. 1993) or behavioral (McConaugha 2002) \n\nadaptations to enhance their overall feeding efficiency. Planktotrophic larvae of many \n\nbenthic species appear to have evolved a certain feeding plasticity, in order to be able \n\nto feed over a broad range of prey sizes, types and abundances (Hinz et al. 2001; \n\nMcConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin 2005; Strathmann and Bone 1997). By feeding on \n\nsmaller and/or suboptimal food items, developing larvae may minimize the negative \n\neffects of low food density and avoid starvation. In fact, this feeding plasticity had \n\nalready been previously documented in decapods, such as homarid lobsters and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n15 \n\nbrachyuran crabs that were recorded to successfully perform suspension feeding (in \n\ncontrast with the most commonly recorded raptorial feeding behavior) when \n\nsubjected to suboptimal food conditions(Barshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; McConaugha \n\n2002).  \n\n \n\n1.2.1.1 Larval nutrition and digestion \n\nA prey item captured by a feeding decapod larva will be first masticated by the \n\nmandibles. While food is processed through the esophagus and cardiac stomach some \n\nmechanical digestion takes place. Upon reaching the gastric mill food is broken down \n\nfurther through mechanical grinding and internal mastication. In the pyloric stomach, \n\nthe gastric juices will then be filtered and transferred to the hepatopancreas, where \n\nintracellular digestion will be catabolized by digestive enzymes. Fecal pellets will finally \n\nbe expelled through the anus (Anger 2001). During this process, nutrients important \n\nfor larval survival and development are assimilated and transformed.  \n\nIn decapods, essential nutrients include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Lipids are \n\nprobably the most important energy source (Anger 2001) and are catabolized when \n\nlarvae are deprived of food (Ritar et al. 2003a). During starvation, proteins, along with \n\nlipids, play an important role as energy sources to the developing larva (Anger 2001; \n\nJohnston et al. 2004). Despite the fact that marine decapods are not able to efficiently \n\nstore carbohydrates reserves and that lipids and proteins may be more relevant to fuel \n\nlarval energetics, carbohydrates are expected to be important, even though its role is \n\nnot yet fully understood (S\u00e1nchez-Paz et al. 2006).  \n\nDespite ample evidences that larvae of most species of decapods are omnivorous (e.g.: \n\nBarshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; Hinz et al. 2001; McConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin \n\n2005), larvae are not necessarily adapted to digest the various nutrients ingested with \n\nthe same efficiency. The effectiveness of food assimilation primarily depends on two \n\nfactors: 1) gut evacuation time (GET, the interval between first consumption of an item \n\nand its first appearance in fecal material) and 2) activity of digestive enzymes. In many \n\nspecies there is a negative relationship between the two factors, enzymatic activity \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n16 \n\nincreasing with decreasing GET. Indeed, increased residence time of food within the \n\ngut implies higher assimilation efficiency  and as a result high enzymatic activity is not \n\nnecessary (Kurmaly et al. 1990).  \n\nDuring digestion, the activation of specific enzymes, primarily synthesized in the \n\nhepatopancreas, will result in the degradation of different dietary macromolecules. \n\nThe analysis of their dynamics during periods of starvation (or suboptimal feeding) may \n\nbe an excellent indicator of which nutrients act as energy reserves and which are \n\npreferentially catabolized under these scenarios (Johnston 2003; Johnston et al. 2004; \n\nJones et al. 1997; Kamarudin et al. 1994; Lovett and Felder 1990a; Rotllant et al. 2010). \n\nFor instance, high protease activity is indicative of protein catabolism, while amylase \n\nactivity indicates the consumption of carbohydrates (Johnston 2003; Kamarudin et al. \n\n1994). Additionally, it has been suggested that amylase may play other role than just \n\ncatabolizing carbohydrates, even though its role has not yet been fully understood \n\n(Jones et al. 1997). Studying amylase activity in omnivorous species may help \n\nunderstand why this enzyme is active in spite of the scarcity of its substrate.  \n\n \n\n1.2.1.2 Feeding strategies \n\nMost decapod larvae require food to successfully develop and are thus classified as \n\nplanktotrophic. On the other end of the continuum, there are species which larvae can \n\naccomplish their complete (or partial) larval development, without feeding. These \n\nlecithotrophic larvae rely entirely on internal nutritional reserves that have been \n\nprovided from the female to the embryo. This mode of development is often \n\nassociated with environments where food availability is highly unpredictable, such as \n\nthe deep sea (e.g.: Pond et al. 1997). However, even in areas that commonly display \n\nhigh food production, larvae can be subjected to variable periods of food limitation \n\ndue to the natural patchiness of the pelagic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; \n\nFolt and Burns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995; Strathmann 1985).  \n\nLarval dependence on food may vary intra-specifically depending on developmental \n\nstage. The ability of newly hatched larvae to successfully molt through one or more \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n17 \n\nlarval stages without feeding is called primary lecithotrophy. The amount of time a \n\nlarva will be able to survive starvation and still be capable of normal development once \n\nsuitable food conditions are encountered will depend upon the energetic reserves \n\nprovided by the female into the embryos. During the planktonic larval phase, some \n\nspecies will be able to start feeding when food becomes available (facultative \n\nlecithotrophy) while others are unable to ingest food even if preys are encountered \n\n(obligate lecithotrophy) (Anger 2001).  \n\nAs in many species the yolk reserves are highly depleted at hatching, newly hatched \n\nlarvae of many species are not able to successfully reach the second larval stage \n\nrelying solely on the nutrients provided by the female. These larvae will therefore be \n\ndependent on exogenous food, whose quality and quantity will influence larval \n\ndevelopment. However, energetic reserves stored from exogenous feeding may allow \n\nlater stages to develop without food through metamorphosis (e.g.: Abrunhosa et al. \n\n2008; Anger and Schubart 2005; Thessalou-Legaki et al. 1999). This case of endotrophic \n\ndevelopment is called secondary lecithotrophy and can be explained in post-larval \n\nstage as an adaptation to food limitation as the individual is searching for a suitable \n\nhabitat to metamorphose and settle as a benthic juvenile (Calado et al. 2007b; Calado \n\net al. 2010).  \n\nThese different feeding strategies have evolved in response to different food quantity \n\nand quality available to both adults and larvae in the various habitats occupied by \n\ndecapods, and maximize larval survival and development. However, regardless of the \n\nstrategy, unpredictable food shortage may occur at any point of the life cycle and \n\ndifferent mechanisms exist to allow the planktotrophic larvae to cope with periods of \n\nstarvation. These responses include changes in feeding rate and reduced prey \n\nselectivity as the larvae become increasingly opportunistic under reduced food \n\nconditions (Barshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; McConaugha 2002). In addition, gut \n\nevacuation time and/or enzymes activity can increase under such unfavorable \n\nconditions to optimize the assimilation of the limited amounts of nutrients ingested \n\nwhen the larvae encounters areas of unsuitable prey quantity and quality (Lovett and \n\nFelder 1990a). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n18 \n\n1.2.2 Migrations \n\nVertical migration is a behavior commonly observed in marine organisms which can \n\nenhance feeding, predator avoidance or transport. Since most decapod larvae have \n\nlimited swimming abilities, vertical swimming generally represents the only form of \n\nactively influencing horizontal dispersal (Sulkin 1984). Vertical position of offshore \n\ndecapod larvae is known to vary according to the phase of the day, as well as to \n\nontogenic development. However, regardless of the type, vertical migration ultimately \n\naffects horizontal transport by subjecting larvae to depth varying current intensities \n\nand directions (dos Santos et al. 2008; Queiroga and Blanton 2005). \n\n \n\n1.2.2.1 Diel vertical migrations \n\nThe most commonly known and described pattern of zooplanktonic migration takes \n\nplace on a daily cycle. Diel vertical migration (DVM) behavior displayed by decapod \n\nlarvae conform to the three main patterns described for general zooplanktonic forms \n\n(Forward 1988). In nocturnal migration, which is the most common form, larvae rise to \n\nsurface water during the night to feed and sink below the photic zone during the day, \n\nprobably to reduce predation pressure (Forward 1988; Pearre 2003). In the second \n\nform, known as reverse diel vertical migration, larvae rise to the surface during the day \n\nand sink to deeper water at night (Forward 1988). Finally, in twilight migration, larvae \n\nreach minimum depths near sunset, descend to intermediate depths during the night \n\nand rise again to surface near sunrise before sinking to remain in deeper water during \n\nthe day (Forward 1988). Nevertheless, even within the same species, DVM behavior is \n\nnot always the same and might vary with area (e.g. distance from coast) or \n\nenvironmental conditions such as fluctuations in predator or prey abundances or \n\nvertical stratification (Han and Straskraba 2001). Reverse DVM has been suggested as a \n\ndefense against predator undergoing nocturnal vertical migration. As observed in \n\nvarious copepod species, when predators exhibit nocturnal DVM their prey may \n\nundergo reverse DVM (Irigoien et al. 2004; Osgood and Frost 1994). This behavior has \n\nbeen associated to areas where the predators present rely more on tactile stimuli than \n\nsight, like it is the case for many invertebrate predators (e.g.: chaetognaths and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n19 \n\ngelatinous zooplankton) which themselves are undergoing nocturnal DVM as a way to \n\nescape fish predators (Tester et al. 2004). Additionally, reverse DVM has also been \n\nobserved in areas with lower abundances of predatory fish (Lagergren et al. 2008). \n\nSince shifts in predator populations occur, the prey must be able to adjust their \n\nbehavior accordingly, and larvae of some species might be able to exhibit plasticity in \n\ntheir DVM behavior with changing environmental conditions.  \n\nKnowledge of DVM behavior of larvae of species that accomplish their entire lifecycle \n\noffshore is limited to a few species. Nocturnal diel vertical migration has been \n\nobserved in Cancer spp. and Randalia ornata zoeae, but megalopae did not display \n\nclear vertical migration, suggesting that these species undergo an ontogenetic shift in \n\nvertical migration behavior off the coast of California (Shanks 1986). \n\n \n\n1.2.2.2 Ontogenic migration \n\nOn a longer time scale, vertical position in the water column will vary with \n\ndevelopment stage. Newly hatched larvae feeing in surface waters will be encountered \n\nat lower depth than the megalopae searching for suitable settlement site near benthic \n\nadult habitats (Queiroga and Blanton 2005; Queiroga et al. 2007). This shift results in \n\nchanging behavioral responses during ontogenetic development (Queiroga and \n\nBlanton 2005; Queiroga et al. 2007). This behavior has been observed in many \n\ndecapods accomplishing their entire life cycle offshore, including prawns, such as \n\nAristeus antennatus (Carbonell et al. 2010), and brachyuran crabs such as Geryon \n\nquinquedens (Kelly et al. 1982). In early stages the combination of high barokinesis and \n\nnegative geotaxis acts to position the larvae in a food-rich environment close to the \n\nsurface, hence favoring growth (Sulkin 1984). In contrast, the megalopa is the stage \n\nthat needs to encounter a suitable environment for settlement and subsequent \n\nmetamorphosis. Therefore, it will move towards the bottom, which is usually achieved \n\nby positive geotaxis. In general terms, the response of larvae to a number of \n\nenvironmental factors involved in depth regulation, such as light, gravity or pressure, \n\nchanges through ontogeny, resulting in deeper distributions in later stages (Sulkin \n\n1984). Additionally, changes in morphological and biochemical adaptations of larvae \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n20 \n\nthroughout ontogeny also affect their buoyancy, further influencing their vertical \n\ndistribution (Sulkin 1984). \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Dispersal and recruitment \n\nWhile DVM behavior can be related to predator-avoidance mechanisms (Han and \n\nStraskraba 2001), it ultimately affects horizontal transport by subjecting larvae to \n\nvariable current intensities and directions (dos Santos et al. 2008; Queiroga and \n\nBlanton 2005). It is less clear, however, how vertical migrations in the open ocean \n\nresult in retention in, or transport to, areas more favorable for successful development \n\nand settlement.  \n\nIt is however widely documented that biotic and abiotic cues influence larval position \n\nin the water column. Examples of such factors include: physical properties of the water \n\n(i.e. temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic pressure), light levels, predator and prey \n\nconcentration, state of feeding, and endogenous rhythms (Epifanio and Garvine 2001; \n\nFolt and Burns 1999; Forward 1988). Larvae not only respond to exogenous cues to be \n\ntransported to suitable settling habitat, but also need to be retained in water masses \n\nwith tolerable conditions for development (Hobbs et al. 1992). For instance, there is a \n\nnegative relationship between temperature and larval development time (O'Connor et \n\nal. 2007), which will affect mortality because an extended larval development period at \n\nlow temperatures translates into a larger time period of exposure to mortality factors \n\nsuch as predation (Morgan 1995). Additionally, extreme conditions of temperature will \n\nincrease mortality (Anger 1987) and many decapod species show enhanced \n\ndevelopment under typical oceanic salinity (approximately 35) (Anger et al. 2000; \n\nAnger et al. 1998; Baylon and Suzuki 2007). Decapod larvae therefore detect and \n\nrespond to changes in those physical parameters so that they are retained in a specific \n\nwater mass favorable to development and thus greatly affecting transport, survival and \n\nsettlement (Forward and Tankersley 2001; Shanks 1986). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n21 \n\n1.3 Model Species \n\nBoth Nephrops norvegicus and Monodaeus couchi may provide a good model for the \n\nunderstanding of larval ecology of deep-sea decapod crustaceans. The observations of \n\nthe larvae of these species may help expand our understanding on the general factors \n\nthat control the spatial and temporal distribution of offshore benthic decapod \n\ncrustacean larvae in general.  \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Nephrops norvegicus \n\nThe Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially \n\nimportant benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in Northeastern Atlantic \n\nwaters, from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco, and in the Mediterranean Sea \n\n(d\u2019Udekem d\u2019Acoz 1999). The adult depth range varies from 15 to 800 m, although \n\nthey are typically found on the NE Atlantic shelf between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck \n\net al. 1997a) and 200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sard\u00e0 1997). Off \n\nthe coast of Portugal, the adults are thus encountered at a depth (between 400 to \n\n800 m) where food availability is reduced. Since lipid requirements of developing ovary \n\nseem to be more dependent on the recent ingestion of dietary lipids than on \n\nhepatopancreas reserves (Rosa and Nunes 2002), the state of feeding during \n\novogenesis will play an important role in energy allocation into the oocytes. Indeed, \n\nvariations in nutrient content of the ovaries has been observed to vary between \n\npopulations (Tuck et al. 1997b). Rosa el al. (2003) also extensively described fatty acid \n\nconsumption through embryonic development. Lipid catabolism plays a crucial role \n\nduring development, and up to 70% of the initial total lipid content can be depleted \n\nbefore hatching (Rosa et al. 2005; Rosa et al. 2003). In this way, it is possible that \n\nfemale\u2019s feeding status shortly at vitellogenesis may play a decisive role in hatching \n\nsuccess and larval quality.  \n\nThe reproduction period of this species varies with location, as average embryo \n\nincubation period lasts up to 10 months in the Northeastern Atlantic and only 6 \n\nmonths in the Mediterranean Sea (Sard\u00e0 1995). These latitudinal differences affect the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n22 \n\ntiming of larval hatching in N. norvegicus , with larval release occurring by early spring \n\nin the Northeastern Atlantic and at the end of winter in the Mediterranean (Rotllant et \n\nal. 2004). During such an extended period of incubation, variation in environmental \n\nconditions can greatly affect embryonic metabolism and therefore the use of yolk \n\nreserves. Potential deleterious effects resulting from suboptimal environmental \n\nconditions are commonly reduced through adaptations in the brooding behavior of \n\novigerous females (Eriksson et al. 2006).  However, despite maternal care, differences \n\nin nutritional state have already been recorded in newly hatched N. norvegicus larvae. \n\nIn the Mediterranean, larvae are larger in size and richer in lipids and proteins than \n\nthose from the Irish sea, which emphasizes the major role that these features may play \n\nfor larval survival in oligotrophic environments (Rotllant et al. 2004). \n\nAmong the early works on N. norvegicus, many were made with females from \n\nPortuguese waters such as the studies by Figueiredo who described population \n\nstructure of this species off the coast of Portugal (Figueiredo and Thomas 1967) and \n\nprovided a general microscopical description of the ovaries (Figueiredo 1972) and \n\nestablished a color based scale to visualize ovarian development (Figueiredo and \n\nBarraca 1963). Figueiredo and Nunes (1965) also estimated that egg loss during \n\nincubation off the coast of Portugal was of about 75% regardless of the size of the \n\nfemale. Additionally, in the first steps on culturing Norway lobster larvae in the \n\nlaboratory, Figueiredo and Vilela (1972) who found that the best temperature level for \n\nincubation and survival were between 11 and 14\u00baC.   \n\nOff the Coast of Portugal, adult Norway lobsters occur at depths ranging from 400 to \n\n800 m and larval hatching period is known to take place from December to April (dos \n\nSantos and Peliz 2005). After incubation on the female abdomen, larvae hatch as \n\nplanktonic larvae, develop through 3 larval stages and then migrate back near the \n\nbottom during the decapodite stage before settling on the benthos as a juvenile (Sard\u00e0 \n\n1995). Dos Santos and Peliz (2005) established that newly hatched larvae escape \n\noligotrophic environment in the aphotic zone by undergoing a migration towards the \n\nfood rich photic zone near surface to forage for suitable prey.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n23 \n\n1.3.2 Monodaeus couchi \n\nMonodaeus couchi is a xanthid crab that inhabits muddy substrates (Ingle 1983b) from \n\nEngland to Angola and in the Mediterranean over a bathymetric range extending from \n\n60 to 1300 m (Gonzalez-Gurriar\u00e1n and M\u00e9ndez G. 1985; Zariquiey Alvarez 1968). It is \n\ncommonly associated with mud volcanoes, carbonate chimneys and cold seeps in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz region (Cunha, M. R., University of Aveiro, unpublished observations). In \n\nslope habitats of Southern Iberian Peninsula and of the Mediterranean Sea the species \n\nco-occurs with the commercially important Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus \n\n(Gonzalez-Gurriar\u00e1n and M\u00e9ndez G. 1985; Maynou and Sard\u00e0 1997; Mori et al. 1995; \n\nTuck et al. 1997a). After hatching the larvae undergoes 4 zoeal stage and one \n\nmegalopal stage (Ingle 1983a). So far, the biology of this species has not been studied.  \n\n \n\n1.4 General objectives and thesis outline \n\nIn order to better understand the early life biology of offshore species with a \n\nbenthopelagic lifecycle in offshore habitats, a series of studies were performed using \n\ndecapod species as a model. Individual variability of maternal input into embryos, early \n\nlarval behavior, feeding and digestion, as well as general decapod larval distribution of \n\nthe Southwestern coast of Portugal, were investigated. More specifically, the \n\nobjectives of this thesis were to: \n\n? Investigate inter-individual variability and document the existence of within-\n\nbrood variation in the fatty acid profiles of Nephrops norvegicus embryos,  \n\n? Clarify the behavioral and digestive enzyme response of early-stage Nephrops \n\nnorvegicus larvae under various feeding scenarios, \n\n? Describe both diel and ontogenic vertical migration behavior of Monodaeus \n\ncouchi throughout larval development, \n\n? Obtain data on the composition, abundance and distribution of decapod \n\ncrustacean larvae off the south Portuguese coast during winter. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n24 \n\nThe following provides the content of each chapter. Each one, except the introduction \n\nand concluding remarks, represents different units with specific and well defined \n\nobjectives, organized in individual sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion \n\nand References). \n\nThe quality and quantity of maternal nutrient investment to the embryos will highly \n\naffect larval success. In Chapter 2, the existence of within-brood variability in the \n\nembryonic fatty acid (FA) profile was investigated across the brooding chamber to \n\ndetermine if attachment site affected FA profiles of developing N. norvegicus embryos. \n\nIn general, FA composition of embryos sampled from both sides of the brooding \n\nchamber did not differ according to that factor. In contrast, all females exhibited \n\nsignificant differences in the FA profiles of embryos sampled from different pleopods. \n\nOverall, saturated FA (SFA) profiles were more variable across the brooding chamber \n\nthan highly unsaturated FA (HUFA). Potential causes for intra-individual variations \n\nrecorded in FA profile may be differential female investment during oocyte production \n\nand/or shifts in FA catabolism during the incubation period promoted by embryo\u2019s \n\nlocation within the brooding chamber.  \n\n?

Inter-individual and within brood variability in the fatty acid profiles of \n\nNorway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (L.) embryos. Submitted to Marine \n\nBiology \n\nAfter hatching, and independently from maternal investment, planktotrophic larvae \n\nmight face intermittent periods of starvation due to the natural patchiness of the \n\nocean. Chapter 3 investigated the feeding response of the first two zoeal stages of N. \n\nnorvegicus under variable prey densities, prey types, feeding histories and \n\nphotoperiods. Both zoeae (Z) I and II increased the number of consumed prey with \n\nincreasing food levels. Both stages displayed preference in prey size, as ZI preferred \n\nsmaller preys and ZII displayed higher ingestion rates of larger preys at higher food \n\nconcentrations. Feeding history also affected prey ingestion which indicated that \n\nlarvae may maximize prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n25 \n\nfood abundance and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of \n\nintermittent starvation or unsuitable prey densities/types.  \n\n?

Biological \n\nBulletin. 216: 335\u2013343.  \n\nIn addition to feeding plasticity, adaptations in digestive mechanisms can further \n\nenhance the ability of larvae to cope with intermittent starvation and/or variations in \n\nprey quality. In Chapter 4, protease and amylase activity of N. norvegicus was \n\ninvestigated in early stage larvae under different feeding scenarios. Amylase activity \n\nwas generally low, indicating that carbohydrates are not used as the primary energy \n\nreserve and that feeding is required soon after hatching to trigger amylase activity. In \n\ncontrast, protease activity increased in starved larvae after more than 12h of \n\nstarvation, indicating that protein reserves are being catabolized. These highlight the \n\nrole of early feeding plasticity in enzymatic activity of N. norvegicus larvae to overcome \n\nshort-term starvation.  \n\n? Pochelon P. N., H. Queiroga, G.

Chapter 5 describes vertical distribution of \n\nthe larvae of a brachyuran crab, Monodaeus couchi. Abundance and distribution of ZI \n\nand II were correlated. For all stages, abundance decreased with depth during the light \n\nphase while it increased with depth at night, thus displaying reverse DVM. \n\nAdditionally, this species undergo an ontogenic shift in vertical distribution as earlier \n\nzoeal stages remain in the upper layers while later stages were encountered deeper.  \n\n?

Coastal species \n\nthat dominate in the first campaign were almost completely absent the following year \n\nand annual differences in overall abundances were observed. Additionally, distribution \n\nand abundance varied between sampling area, which is likely to be the result of \n\ngeneral circulation patterns. An upwelling event that occurred off the southwest coast \n\nof Portugal at the time of sampling explained the differences in decapod larvae \n\nabundances and diversity observed between the Southwestern and Northeastern part \n\nof the sampling area. In the NE, the most abundant species were retained onshore \n\nwhile offshore transport occurred in zooplankton and to a lesser extent in some shelf \n\nspecies.  \n\n? Pochelon P.

The different challenges faced and how each stage has \n\nevolved to cope and/or overcome them is discussed. Finally, this chapter includes \n\nsuggestions of future directions for offshore decapod research that will allow a better \n\nunderstanding of how suboptimal conditions during early life history affect later \n\nstages.

There were no significant differences in the FA composition of embryos \n\nsampled from both sides of the brooding chamber in 4 of the 5 surveyed females. \n\nHowever, all females exhibited significant differences in the FA profiles of embryos \n\nsampled from different pleopods. Similarly, for both saturated FA (SFA) and highly \n\nunsaturated FA (HUFA), FA profiles were not similar across the breeding chamber. \n\nOverall, FA reserves appeared to vary significantly within broods, which can ultimately \n\nbe reflected on early larval survival. A potential cause for the within brood variation \n\nrecorded in the FA profile of developing embryos include: 1) differential female \n\ninvestment during ovarian maturation, mainly due to variation in food \n\nquality/availability; 2) differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period of \n\ndeveloping embryos, as a consequence of embryos position within the female\u2019s \n\nbrooding chamber; or 3) differential female investment during ovarian maturation \n\namplified by differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n41 \n\n2.2 Introduction \n\nThe Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially \n\nimportant benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in the Northeastern (NE) \n\nAtlantic, from the coast of Iceland to Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea \n\n(d\u2019Udekem d\u2019Acoz 1999). Its depth range extends from 15 to 800 m, although they are \n\ntypically found on the NE Atlantic coast between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. \n\n1997a). Several studies have already focused on different aspects of the biology and \n\nfisheries of N. norvegicus, but biochemical data related with the species reproductive \n\ncycle and embryonic development are still fairly recent and scarce (Rosa et al. 2003; \n\nRosa and Nunes 2002; Rotllant et al. 2004; Tuck et al. 1997b). Mating occurs just after \n\nmolting, shortly following the hatching from the previous year. Between 2 to 3 months \n\nlater, an increase in ovary size is observed and during the following 4-5 months, \n\nvitellogenesis occurs (Rotllant et al. 2005). Spawned embryos are attached to the \n\npleopods on the abdomen and incubated over an extensive period (up to 10 month in \n\nthe NE Atlantic, Sard\u00e0 1995). In several decapods, and specifically in nephropid \n\nlobsters, ovarian  maturation has been shown to have high energetic costs, embryonic \n\ndevelopment is lecithotrophic, i.e.: is entirely supported by egg yolk (Rosa and Nunes \n\n2002).  \n\nIn N. norvegicus, lipid profiles of developing ovaries seem to be more dependent on \n\nthe ingestion of dietary lipids than on hepatopancreas reserves (Rosa and Nunes \n\n2002). In this way, it is possible that female\u2019s feeding status during the extensive \n\nperiod over which vitellogenesis occurs can play a decisive role on hatching success \n\nand larval quality. Off the coast of mainland Portugal, N. norvegicus inhabits muddy \n\nsubstrate areas located between 400-800 m depth (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita \n\n2001). These deep-water habitats are characterized by a relative scarcity of available \n\nfood resources (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999), which may affect the nutritional state \n\nof females exhibiting developing ovaries and, consequently, potential energetic \n\nreserves available to fuel embryonic development. It is already known that lipids play a \n\ncentral role in embryonic metabolism, as they represent the most important energy \n\nsource and form at least 60% of the total energy expenditure of developing crustacean \n\nembryos (Wehrtmann and Graeve 1998). In nephropid lobsters (e.g. N. norvegicus and \n\n\n\nVariability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus \n\n42 \n\nHomarus gammarus), lipid catabolism plays a crucial role during embryonic \n\ndevelopment, with up to70% of initial total lipids being depleted before hatching (Rosa \n\net al. 2005; Rosa et al. 2003). \n\nAmong lipids, fatty acids (FA) are critical in embryonic development. Highly \n\nunsaturated FA (HUFA) with more than 20 C atoms are essential and therefore must be \n\ningested from food as crustacean cannot, or only insufficiently, synthesized them de \n\nnovo (Anger 2001).  Long chain HUFA, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and \n\ndocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play important roles in neuronal development, ion \n\ntransport and temperature regulation. Because embryonic development is \n\nlecithotrophic and essential FA (EFA) cannot be synthesised de novo, these nutrients \n\nmust be supplied by the female into the yolk reserves to ensure successful \n\ndevelopment. In contrast, saturated FA (SFA) can be synthesised from other FA and are \n\noxidized to produce energy. \n\nFA dynamics through embryonic development have been studied in detail for several \n\ndecapod groups, namely caridean shrimp (e.g.: Graeve and Wehrtmann 2003), \n\nbrachyuran crabs (e.g.: Torres et al. 2008) and nephropid lobsters, such as Homarus \n\ngammarus (Rosa et al. 2005) and N. norvegicus (Rosa et al. 2003). These studies allow \n\nus to understand the nutritional requirements exhibited by developing embryos along \n\nthe incubation period. However, due to laboratorial constraints associated with the \n\nanalytical techniques employed to perform FA analysis, egg samples of several females \n\nare commonly pooled together and inter-individual differences are not generally \n\nassessed. Additionally, to our knowledge, variability of FA profiles in the same egg \n\nmass has never been determined in any decapod crustacean. Lower oxygen availability \n\nhas already been observed at the center of the condensed egg mass of brachyuran \n\ncrabs (Fernandez et al. 2003). Potential deleterious effects resulting from this decrease \n\nin oxygen availability are commonly reduced through adaptations in the brooding \n\nbehavior of ovigerous females (Baeza and Fern\u00e1ndez 2002). Such brooding behaviors \n\n(e.g. abdominal flapping) have already been documented in ovigerous N. norvegicus \n\n(Eriksson et al. 2006). Embryonic metabolic rates commonly increase in reduced \n\noxygen environment and yolk reserves provided by the female can be depleted at a \n\nfaster rate (Brante et al. 2003). Although oxygen levels have so far never been \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n43 \n\ndocumented in N. norvegicus, hypoxia has already been shown to cause premature \n\nhatching, reduced embryonic survival and increased embryonic heart beat frequency \n\nin this species (Eriksson et al. 2006). \n\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate how homogeneous is the fatty \n\nacid profile of embryos in a single egg mass and test if embryos position along the \n\nfemale\u2019s brooding chamber (chamber side and pleopod to which embryos are \n\nattached) has any effect on their FA composition. Additionally, inter-individual \n\nvariability in the FA profiles of N. norvegicus embryos was also assessed. \n\n \n\n2.3 Material and Methods \n\n2.3.1 Sampling \n\nFive ovigerous N. norvegicus females (CL: 5.08 \u00b1 0.38 cm), collected in January 2008 by \n\na commercial fishing vessel using baited traps off the coast of Sagres (Southwestern \n\nCoast of mainland Portugal), at an approximate depth of 400 m, were selected for the \n\npresent study. Across the brooding chamber, the embryos carried by each female \n\ndisplayed clearly visible eyes with 1/2 yolk consumed and were considered to be in \n\ndevelopment stage II (according to the scale proposed by Rosa et al. 2007). Embryos \n\nattached to each pleopod were carefully removed with a pair of forceps and stored in \n\nseparate Eppendorfs. A preliminary analysis of eggs randomly sampled from each \n\npleopod, indicated that there was no difference in egg size (1.27 \u00b1 0.19 mm\n-3\n\n). \n\nAdditionally, a visual inspection revealed that, within a single female, eggs from \n\ndifferent pleopods were at the same point in development.  \n\nLike most lobster, N. norvegicus ovaries are shaped like an elongated H and posses a \n\nright and left lobe connected by a small cross lobe (Rotllant et al. 2005). Because of the \n\nbilateral nature of the ovaries, left and right side pleopods were processed separately \n\n(not pooled). Due to the reduced number of embryos present in the 1st and 5th pair of \n\npleopods, pooled samples of embryos were collected from the 1st and 2nd, as well as \n\nfrom the 4th and 5th, pair of pleopods, (see Fig. 1). In this way the following number of \n\nsamples were collected: 2 sides of the brooding chamber (right and left) X 3 groups of \n\n\n\nVariability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus \n\n44 \n\npleopods (1\nst \n\n&amp; 2\nnd\n\n, 3\nrd\n\n and 4\nth\n\n &amp; 5\nth\n\n) X 6 replicates X 5 females = 180 samples. Embryos \n\nwere freeze-dried and stored at -32\u00baC for later biochemical analysis.  \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Fatty acid analysis \n\nFA extraction and preparation of methyl esters were carried out according to Lepage \n\nand Roy (1986) modified by Cohen et al. (1988). Freeze-dried samples (100 mg) were \n\ntransmethylated with 5 ml of methanol/acetyl chloride (95:5 v/v). The mixture was \n\nsealed in a light-protected Teflon-lined vial under nitrogen atmosphere and heated at \n\n80\u00b0C for 1 h. The vial contents were then cooled, diluted with 1 ml water, and \n\nextracted with 2 ml of n-heptane. The heptane layer was dried over Na2SO4, \n\nevaporated to dryness under a nitrogen atmosphere and redissolved in heptane, which \n\ncontained the methyl esters. The methyl esters were then analyzed by gas-liquid \n\nchromatography, on a VARIAN (Palo Alto, USA) 3800 gas-liquid chromatograph (USA), \n\nequipped with a flame ionization detector. Separation was carried out on a 0.32 mm \u00d7 \n\n30 m fused silica capillary column (film 0.32 \u00b5m) Supelcowax 10 (SUPELCO, Bellafonte \n\nPA, USA) with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.3 ml min\n\u20131\n\n. The column \n\ntemperature was programmed at an initial temperature of 200\u00b0C for 10 min, then \n\nincreased at 4\u00b0C min\n\u20131 \n\nto 240\u00b0C and held there for 16 min. Injector and detector \n\ntemperatures were 250 and 280\u00b0C, respectively, and split ratio was 1:100. Peak \n\nidentification was carried out using known standards (GC 462, Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, \n\nUSA). Peak areas were determined using the Varian software and the FA 21:0 was used \n\nas an internal standard. The detection limit for the FAs analyzed was 0.01 ?g mg\n-1\n\n dry \n\nweight. \n\n2.3.3 Statistical analysis \n\nIn order to visualize inter-individual differences in FA profiles, a Principal Coordinate \n\nAnalysis (PCO) was performed, representing differences between all replicate for each \n\nfemale along the first two axes. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to \n\ndetect intra-individual differences in: 1) FA composition of N. norvegicus embryos, but \n\nonly considering those representing more than 5% of total FA; 2) SFA composition; and \n\n3) HUFA composition. We decided to specifically test the differences in SFA and HUFA \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n45 \n\ncomposition due to the role that SFA catabolism plays to fuel the energetic demands of \n\nembryonic development and because several HUFAs are already known to be essential \n\nFAs for decapods (e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA, docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) \n\n(Anger 2001). Prior to statistical analysis, all data were square root transformed, in \n\norder to reduce the contribution of highly and less abundant FA. A resemblance matrix \n\nwas computed using Bray-Curtis similarity.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Schematic representation of Nephrops norvegicus female\u2019s abdominal ventral view \nillustrating the six distinct regions of the brooding chamber where developing embryos were sampled \nfor fatty acid analysis (the egg mass attached to the 1\n\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n pleopods was pooled, as well as that \n\nfrom the 4\nth\n\n and 5\nth\n\n pleopods).

Factor brooding chamber side was tested due to the elongated H \n\nlike shape displayed by N. norvegicus ovaries, with their right and left lobes connected \n\nby a small cross-lobe at the level of the heart (Rotllant et al. 2005). The effect of factor \n\npleopod (3 levels: 1\nst \n\n&amp; 2\nnd\n\n, 3\nrd\n\n and 4\nth\n\n &amp; 5\nth\n\n) and factor brooding chamber side (2 \n\nlevels: left and right) on FA composition were determined separately for each female \n\nusing an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM).  \n\nANOSIM calculates a global R statistic that assesses the differences in variability \n\nbetween groups, as compared to within groups, and checks for the significance of R \n\nusing permutation tests (Clarke and Gorley 2006). Differences in FA profiles recorded \n\nfor pleopod and side were explored using the similarity percentages routine (SIMPER). \n\nSIMPER decomposes average Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between all pairs of samples, \n\ninto percentage contributions from each FA, listing FAs in decreasing order of their \n\ncontribution for the dissimilarity (Clarke and Gorley 2006). All statistical tests were \n\nperformed with Primer 6.1 with PERMANOVA add-on (Primer-E Ltd, Plymouth, UK). All \n\ntests used 9999 permutations. \n\n \n\n2.4 Results \n\nThe result of the PCO analysis indicated that, despite high within-brood variability, \n\nthere were difference in FA profiles, especially between female 2, 3 and 5 (Figure 2). \n\nWithin each brooding chamber, a comparison of the size of the embryo, eye and the \n\nyolk sack that embryos of different pleopods were of similar and therefore at the same \n\npoint in development.

The FA profile of developing \n\nembryos is known to change significantly over time and stage II of embryonic \n\ndevelopment may last a couple of months (Rosa et al. 2003). In this way, as egg \n\nextrusion may have not occurred simultaneously in all sampled specimens, different \n\nfemales may have carried early or late developing stage II embryos at sampling. This \n\naspect alone may explain the inter-individual variability recorded in embryonic FA \n\nprofiles.  \n\nOverall embryonic FA composition was somewhat different from that previously \n\nrecorded for N. norvegicus off the coast of Portugal (Rosa et al. 2003). The order of the \n\n5 most abundant FA in stage II of embryonic development was different between the \n\ntwo studies.  Additionally, the average content of individual FA (per mg of dry weight) \n\nwas around half the value reported by Rosa et al. (2003). This difference in the \n\nabsolute level of FA is also not surprising, as studies on recently hatched N. norvegicus \n\nlarvae have shown that their biochemical composition may vary significantly among \n\nlocations (\u00c1lvarez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2009; Rotllant et al. 2004). However, the sampling \n\nsites of this study and that by Rosa et al. (2003) are only separated by about 200 km. \n\nShifts in food resources influencing growth have been shown to affect ovarian lipid \n\ncomposition (Tuck et al. 1997b). Therefore, it is possible that the difference recorded \n\nin the FA composition of developing embryos may rather be explained by inter-annual \n\ndifferences in female dietary regimes, than by spatial variability. \n\nOnly two HUFA, EPA and DHA, were recorded in comparable levels as in the previous \n\nstudy by Rosa et al. (2003). Both FA are known to play an important developmental \n\nand structural role (Bell and Dick 1990; Fox et al. 1994; Stanley-Samuelson 1987). Since \n\nembryonic development in N. norvegicus is lecithotrophic, and HUFA cannot be \n\nsynthesized de novo, these essential FAs must be derived from the diet during \n\ngametogenesis (Rosa et al. 2007). Some mechanisms may exist to maintain the levels \n\nof these FA relatively stable both at oviposition, and later through embryonic \n\ndevelopment, even if the FA profile of the food ingested by the female is variable. \n\n\n\nVariability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus \n\n54 \n\nIndeed, in the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii, lipid, and more specifically HUFA \n\ncomposition of both ovaries and newly hatched larvae was not affected by the lipid \n\ncontent of the diet (Smith et al. 2004). Within brood variability recorded for the SFA \n\nprofiles of developing embryos between this study and previous ones (Rosa et al. \n\n2007) may ultimately explain variability recorded in early larval survival. In fact, early \n\nlarval performance was found to be associated with high levels of SFA, as energy is \n\nreleased more efficiently through the oxidation of these FA (Turner et al. 2003). \n\nNevertheless, during embryonic development, SFA should be depleted first as they are \n\ncatabolized as an energy source while essential fatty acid should be retained for \n\ngrowth and development. Off the coast of mainland Portugal, N. norvegicus larvae \n\nhatch between 400 and 800 m (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita 2001), and therefore in \n\nan oligotrophic environment. Newly hatched larvae then undergo a migration towards \n\nthe food rich photic zone near surface to forage for suitable prey (dos Santos and Peliz \n\n2005). In the presence of food, zoea I will readily ingest prey immediately after \n\nhatching (Pochelon et al. 2009). However, laboratorial studies have also indicated that \n\nnewly hatched N. norvegicus larvae can endure periods of complete food deprivation \n\n(> 24 h ) by catabolizing embryonic reserves to fulfill their energetic needs \n\n(unpublished data). Given that N. norvegicus larvae are planktotrophic, qualitative and \n\nquantitative differences in embryonic reserves, including lipid, will condition their \n\nability to cope with periods of starvation following hatching. This has already been \n\ndocumented for many decapod species, such as the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii \n\n(Johnston et al. 2004; Ritar et al. 2003a), the anomuran crabs Lithodes santolla and \n\nParalomis granulosa (Kattner et al. 2003) and several penaeid shrimp (D'Abramo \n\n1989). \n\nAs the embryos analyzed were at stage II of embryonic development, the within brood \n\nvariability recorded for their FA profiles can either result from: 1) differential female \n\ninvestment during ovarian maturation, mainly due to variation in food \n\nquality/availability; 2) differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period of \n\ndeveloping embryos, as a consequence of embryos position within the female\u2019s \n\nbrooding chamber; or 3) differential female investment during ovarian maturation \n\namplified by differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period. As stated above, \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n55 \n\nlipid reserves available for embryonic development can only be provided by the female \n\nprior to oviposition. The availability of FA during ovarian maturation will therefore be \n\ndependent on the quantity and/or quality of dietary items ingested by the female. \n\nPrevious studies in lobsters (Smith et al. 2004), and shrimp (Cahu et al. 1995; Calado et \n\nal. 2010a; Racotta et al. 2003) indicated that food supplied to females significantly \n\naffect the FA profiles displayed by produced embryos. Nonetheless, as ovarian \n\nmaturation is a continuous process in N. norvegicus (Rotllant et al. 2005), it\u2019s not likely \n\nthat the differences recorded in the FA profiles of embryos may result from uneven \n\nnutrient allocation during vitellogenesis.  \n\nAlternatively, differences in environmental conditions within the brooding chamber \n\nmay promote a shift in the FA consumption dynamics during the incubation period. It \n\nhas already been described for brachyuran crabs that within the dense embryo mass \n\noxygen concentration can be variable (Fernandez et al. 2003). Contrasting oxygen \n\nlevels can cause variations in embryonic metabolic rates (Brante et al. 2003), which will \n\ntherefore increase energy demand and SFA oxidation. This scenario will cause a \n\ndifferential catabolism of embryonic reserves and eventually lead to asynchronous \n\nlarval hatching (Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). Indeed, N. norvegicus \n\n(personal observation) and Homarus americanus (Pandian 1970), have been recorded \n\nto hatch their larvae over several consecutive nights. These episodes were often \n\nconsidered as a \u201claboratorial artifact\u201d, but the present data evidencing within brood \n\nvariation in embryonic FA profiles supports the potential occurrence of asynchronous \n\nembryonic development in the wild, which may ultimately promote asynchronous \n\nlarval hatching. Ultimately, early larval survival will also be affected.  Since embryonic \n\ndevelopment is lecithotrophic and food might not be readily available immediately \n\nfollowing birth, it can be assumed that the only energy available to the larvae come \n\nfrom the yolk reserves. The larvae that had lower energetic embryonic input may not \n\nbe able to successfully reach the following larval stage, even though short term \n\nsurvival to suboptimal food conditions can still be possible (e.g.: Calado et al. 2010b; \n\nGebauer et al. 1999; Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2003, 2005; Ritar et al. 2003b; Smith et al. \n\n2004). \n\n\n\nVariability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus \n\n56 \n\nAs the present work was performed on stage II embryos, it is impossible to determine \n\nwhether it is maternal investment or embryonic catabolism that is responsible for the \n\nvariability recorded in embryos FA profiles. A continuous monitoring of lipid catabolism \n\ndisplayed by developing embryos located in different regions within the same brooding \n\nchamber, from oviposition to hatching, will certainly help researchers to clarify the \n\nbiochemical variability recorded for N. norvegicus embryos (e.g. by monitoring the FA \n\nprofile of embryos along the brooding chamber immediately after spawning, it will be \n\npossible to determine if maternal investment in yolk reserves is indeed uniform). \n\nAdditionally, by monitoring oxygen concentration along the brooding chamber through \n\nembryonic development, researchers can better understand the potential sources of \n\nvariable egg yolk catabolism within the same egg mass. After performing such studies \n\nit will be possible to determine if and how pre-hatching latent effects are responsible \n\nfor the differences recorded in nephropid larvae hatching synchronism and survival. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors thank Susana Pereira for her help during the sampling and processing of \n\nNorway lobster embryos and Carla Santos during the biochemical analysis.

Newly \n\nhatched larvae of the species may therefore be exposed to suboptimal levels/types of \n\nprey availability and face intermittent periods of starvation at low latitudes. This work \n\ninvestigated the feeding response of the first two zoeal stages of N. norvegicus under \n\nvariable prey densities, prey types, feeding histories and photoperiods. Both zoeae (Z) I \n\nand II increased the number of consumed prey with increasing food levels. ZI preferred \n\nArtemia sp. nauplii over larger metanauplii, while in ZII, higher ingestion was only \n\nobserved for metanauplii at higher food concentrations. The number of prey ingested \n\nby larvae previously starved or under low food conditions was always higher than that \n\nof larvae exposed to high food levels. These findings seem to indicate that larvae may \n\nmaximize prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher food \n\nabundance and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of \n\nintermittent starvation or unsuitable prey densities/types. Extreme photoperiods (24 \n\nand 0h of light) did not improve larval feeding ability and are not a suitable option for \n\nlarviculture. \n\n \n\n3.2 Introduction \n\nThe Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially \n\nimportant benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in the Northeastern Atlantic \n\nwaters from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea (d\u2019Udekem \n\nd\u2019Acoz 1999). Its depth range extends from 15 to 800 m, although they are typically \n\nfound on the NE Atlantic shelf between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. 1997a) and \n\n200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sard\u00e0 1997). In addition to \n\ndifferences in the depth range, the reproduction period of this species also varies \n\nlatitudinally, with average embryo incubation being 10 months in the Northeastern \n\nAtlantic but only 6 months in the Mediterranean (Sard\u00e0 1995). These differences in \n\nembryo incubation duration are known to affect the hatching period of N. norvegicus \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n67 \n\nlarvae, with hatching occurring by early spring in the Northeastern Atlantic and at the \n\nend of winter in the Mediterranean (Rotlland et al. 2004). Off the Coast of Portugal, \n\nadults are encountered at depth ranging from 400 to 800 m and the hatching period \n\nextends from December until April with however some regional differences, larval \n\nrelease peaking earlier in the south than the north. Under these scenarios, early larval \n\ndevelopment at the end of winter will occur in a nutritionally poor environment, since \n\nchlorophyll a peak only occurs during spring (Moita 2001; Santos et al. 2007). Late \n\nlarval release will overlap with the beginning of thermal stratification and spring bloom \n\n(Santos et al. 2007). \n\nRegardless of geographical and seasonal differences in nutritional conditions, it is \n\nwidely accepted that planktonic larvae are naturally subjected to intermittent periods \n\nof starvation and/or suboptimal prey availability due to the natural patchiness of \n\nplankton distribution in the oceanic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; Folt and \n\nBurns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995). Studies addressing larval feeding in clawed lobsters \n\nhave highlighted how early larval feeding greatly affects their development, since \n\nthese organisms may not recover from nutritional stress if suitable food is not available \n\nshortly after hatching (Anger et al. 1985; Rotlland et al. 2001). Newly hatched N. \n\nnorvegicus larvae from the Mediterranean are larger in size and richer in lipids and \n\nproteins than those from the Irish sea, which emphasize the major role that these \n\nfeatures may play for larval survival in oligotrophic environments (Rotlland et al. 2004).  \n\nLarvae submitted to low food conditions use several feeding strategies, and may either \n\nmorphologically (Fenaux et al. 1994; Strathmann et al. 1993) or behaviorally \n\n(McConaugha 2002) enhance their overall feeding efficiency. Planktonic larvae of many \n\nbenthic species appear to have evolved a certain feeding plasticity, in order to be able \n\nto feed over a broad range of prey sizes, types and abundances (Hinz et al. 2001; \n\nMcConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin 2005; Strathmann and Bone 1997). By feeding on \n\nsmaller and/or suboptimal food items, developing larvae may minimize the negative \n\neffects of low food density and avoid starvation. In fact, this feeding plasticity had \n\nalready been previously documented in homarid lobsters, with the last zoeal stage of \n\nHomarus americanus being recorded to successfully perform suspension feeding (in \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n68 \n\ncontrast to the most commonly recorded raptorial feeding behavior) (Barshaw and \n\nBryant-Rich 1988). \n\nDespite the number of studies addressing N. norvegicus larval biology (Briggs et al. \n\n2002; Dickey-Collas et al. 2000a; dos Santos and Peliz 2005; Rotlland et al. 2004) and \n\naquaculture potential (Anger and Puschel 1986; Figueiredo and Vilela 1972; Morais et \n\nal. 2001; Rosa et al. 2003; Rotlland et al. 2001), little is still known about the feeding \n\nability of early zoeal stages.  \n\nOur objective was to assess the feeding ability of N. norvegicus zoea (Z) I and II under \n\nvariable feeding scenarios and to identify the existence of feeding plasticity in these \n\nearly zoeal stages. In this way, the feeding response of N. norvegicus ZI and ZII under \n\nvariable prey densities, prey types and experiencing previous feeding histories was \n\ninvestigated. Additionally, due to the current interest in the larviculture of \n\nN. norvegicus, mainly for restocking purposes, the effect of extreme photoperiods (24 \n\nand 0 hours of light) on prey consumption for both zoeal stages was also evaluated. \n\n \n\n3.3 Material and Methods  \n\n3.3.1 Larval production and selection \n\nFive N. norvegicus ovigerous females were collected between February and April 2008 \n\nusing baited traps near Peniche (West Coast of Portugal), at an approximate depth of \n\n400 m, and kept in the laboratory until their larvae hatched. Newly hatched larvae \n\nwere either selected for the experiments described bellow or reared to the second \n\nzoeal stage using a recirculating larviculture system employing 20 l cylindrico-spherical \n\nculture tanks (see Calado 2008 for further details). Larvae were fed daily with newly \n\nhatched Artemia sp. nauplii (San Francisco Bay Brand Inc., Newark, CA, USA) supplied \n\nat a density of 5 nauplii ml\n-1\n\n, with Artemia sp. cysts being incubated according to the \n\nprocedures described by Sorgeloos et al. (1998). During the culture period, \n\nN. norvegicus larvae were maintained in constant darkness at 15\u00b11\u00baC in a \n\ntemperature-controlled culture room. Natural seawater at a salinity of 35 was 1 \u00b5m \n\nfiltered, passed through activated carbon and UV irradiated before being used in the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n69 \n\nlarviculture system. Larvae were only used in the experimental trials 24 h after \n\nhatching or molting to the second zoeal stage, in order to guarantee that tested \n\nspecimens already displayed larval appendages involved in prey capture, manipulation \n\nand ingestion that were fully functional. Additionally, only those specimens displaying \n\nstrong phototactic responses were selected for the experimental trials, since this \n\nbehavior is commonly employed in crustacean aquaculture to evaluate larval quality \n\n(see Treece and Fox 1993). In all experimental trials, larvae at both zoeal stages were \n\nplaced individually in 40 ml plastic beakers with filtered seawater at a salinity of 35 in a \n\nclimatized chamber at 15\u00b11\u00baC. Larvae recorded as dead or moribund (laying \n\nmotionless in the bottom of the plastic beaker for prolonged periods but still beating \n\nthe exopods of their pereiopods) at the end of experimental trials were discarded and \n\nthose replicates repeated. To ensure a homogenized distribution of prey in the water \n\ncolumn during the experimental trials, minimizing the positive phototactic behavior of \n\nlarvae and dietary prey, each plastic beaker was gently aerated at a rate of ca. one air \n\nbubble per second. \n\n3.3.2 Effect of prey densities and photoperiods \n\nThe feeding ability of N. norvegicus larvae was evaluated by providing to both ZI and ZII \n\nfour different prey densities (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 Artemia sp.  nauplii ml\n-1\n\n) under three \n\ndistinct photoperiods (24, 12 and 0 h of light). After 24 h, the number of live prey \n\nremaining in the plastic beaker was counted under a binocular stereomicroscope, with \n\ndamaged Artemia sp. nauplii (e.g. missing one or both antenna or their abdomen) \n\nbeing considered as ingested. Five replicates were used for each treatment for a total \n\nof 60 specimens (4 densities \u00d7 3 photoperiods \u00d7 5 replicates = 60) per each larval stage. \n\nThe variable used to assess the feeding ability of both ZI and ZII was the total number \n\nof larval prey ingested after 24 h. \n\n3.3.3 Effect of prey types and prey densities \n\nThe combined effect of four different prey types (Artemia sp. nauplii (Naup, average \n\nsize 450 \u00b1 10 ?m), Artemia sp. metanauplii (Meta, average size 590 \u00b1 5 ?m), Artemia \n\nsp. metanauplii enriched with the commercial product Algamac\u2122 2000 produced by \n\nAquafauna, Biomarine Inc., Hawthorne, CA, USA (MetaAlga, average size 592 \u00b17 ?m) \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n70 \n\nand enriched with the spray dried microalgae Spirulina (MetaSpi, average size \n\n591 \u00b1 6 ?m)) and four prey densities (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 prey ml\n-1\n\n) on the feeding ability of \n\nthe first and second zoeal stages of N. norvegicus was evaluated. The enrichments \n\nwere conducted according to the protocols described by Morais et al. (2001) during \n\n16h in 1 l beakers, with strong aeration and a maximum density of 50 nauplii.ml-1; 0.1g \n\nof product was used in 1 l of seawater. All trials were performed under a 12 h light :12 \n\nh dark photoperiod. After 24 h the number of live dietary prey in each beaker was \n\ncounted using the methods and criteria described above. Five replicates were used for \n\neach treatment for a total of 80 specimens (4 prey types \u00d7 4 densities \u00d7 5 \n\nreplicates = 80) per each larval stage. The variable used to assess the feeding ability of \n\nboth ZI and ZII under the experimental conditions was the total number of larval prey \n\ningested after 24 h. \n\n3.3.4 Effect of previous feeding histories \n\nIn order to investigate the feeding ability of N. norvegicus ZI and II previously exposed \n\nto different feeding histories, larvae were acclimated for 12 h to three different \n\nfeeding scenarios: starvation, low prey density (0.5 dietary prey ml-1), and high prey \n\ndensity (5 dietary prey ml-1). After the 12 h acclimation period, larvae from each \n\nfeeding scenario were placed either under low or high prey densities (0.5 and 5 dietary \n\nprey ml-1, respectively) for an additional 12 h. The dietary prey provided to ZI and ZII \n\nwere newly hatched Artemia sp. nauplii and Artemia sp. metanauplii enriched with \n\nAlgamac\u2122 2000, respectively. The two stages were not fed with the same prey item \n\nsince each stage displayed a different preference in the experiment \u201ceffect of prey \n\ntypes and prey densities\u201d. ZI ate more nauplii and ZII more MetaAlga. All trials were \n\nperformed under a 12 h light :12 h dark photoperiod. At the end of the experimental \n\nperiod, the number of live dietary prey was counted according to the criteria \n\npreviously described. Five replicates were used for each treatment for a total of 30 \n\nspecimens (6 feeding histories \u00d7 5 replicates = 30) per each larval stage. The variable \n\nused to assess the feeding ability of both zoeal stages was the total number of larval \n\nprey ingested in the 12 hours following the end of the acclimation period. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n71 \n\n3.3.5 Statistical analysis \n\nThe feeding ability of the two first zoeal stages of N. norvegicus under the first two \n\nexperimental conditions was compared using multi-way factorial analysis of variance \n\nANOVA. The factors tested for each ANOVA were: prey densities (4 levels), \n\nphotoperiods (3 levels), and zoeal stage (2 levels) for the experiment \u201cEffect of prey \n\ndensities and photoperiods\u201d; prey types (4 levels), prey densities (4 levels), and zoeal \n\nstage (2 levels) for the experiment \u201cEffect of prey types and prey densities\u201d. Finally, for \n\nthe experiment \u201cEffect of feeding histories\u201d a one-way ANOVA (6 levels) was used \n\nseparately for each zoeal stage. Statistical analyses were performed using the software \n\nSTATISTICA 6.0 (manufactured by StatSoft Inc., USA). Prior to analysis, assumptions \n\nwere verified and data transformed whenever necessary. Whenever significance was \n\naccepted, at P &lt;0.05, the Tukey multiple comparison test was used (Zar 1999). \n\nSubsequently, average prey consumption will always be reported with its standard \n\ndeviation (mean \u00b1 SD). \n\n \n\n3.4 Results \n\n3.4.1 Effect of prey densities and photoperiods \n\nThere was a significant interaction between larval stage*light regime*prey density \n\n(ANOVA; df = 6, F = 7.77; P &lt;0.001). Feeding responses under either 0 h or 24 h of light \n\ndiffered according to prey density (Figure 1). Zoeae I average prey consumption was \n\nhigher under the lowest and highest prey densities when exposed to 24 h of light \n\n(19.0 \u00b1 0.7 and 112.0 \u00b1 18.6 prey consumed, respectively) than in complete darkness \n\n(14.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 96.0 \u00b1 7.4 prey consumed, respectively). Under the three highest prey \n\ndensity, zoeae I prey consumption was highest under 12 h of light. Concerning zoeae II, \n\naverage prey consumption under 24 h of light was the same as in complete darkness \n\nunder all three lowest prey density but was lower (83.6 \u00b1 8.6 and 120.8 \u00b1 13.1) at the \n\nhighest prey concentration. Under all tested feeding densities, prey consumption of \n\nlarvae at the second zoeal stage was significantly higher under 12 h illumination \n\n(17.2 \u00b1 2.7, 34.2 \u00b1 2.8, 99.0 \u00b1 4.3 and 142.8 \u00b1 4.1 prey consumed for larvae fed at 0.5, \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n72 \n\n1, 3 and 5 prey ml\n-1\n\n, respectively; Figure 1). Other general trends can also be observed, \n\nsuch as a significant overall increase of consumed prey with increasing food levels \n\n(from 15.6 \u00b1 3.2 to 112.9 \u00b1 21.7, df = 3, F = 1750.34; P &lt;0.001), for both larval stages \n\nand light regime experienced combined (Figure 1). Additionally, prey ingestion for both \n\nzoeal stages varied significantly with light conditions (df = 2, F = 35.38; P &lt;0.001), but \n\nwas identical for both stages under the same light regime (df = 1, F = 2.92; P = 0.91). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1: Prey consumption of N. norvegicus ZI and ZII under different prey densities and light \nconditions after a 24 h period. Prey concentration is expressed as the number of prey ml\n\n-1\n. Light \n\nconditions are expressed as hour of illumination, i.e. constant darkness (0h), 12:12 light:dark \nphotoperiod (12h) and constant illumination (24h). Error bars represent standard error. Different \nletters represent significantly different feeding rates. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Effect of prey types and prey densities \n\nA significant interaction between larval stage*prey type*prey density was observed \n\n(ANOVA; df = 9, F = 22.2; P &lt;0.001). Regarding the first zoea, at low prey density, the \n\nnumber of prey ingested did not differ across prey types (17.6 \u00b1 2.2, 15.0 \u00b1 0.7, \n\n13.4 \u00b1 1.3, and 12.8 \u00b1 0.8 for Naup, Meta, MetaAlga and MetaSpi, respectively; Figure \n\n2). However, as prey density increased, prey consumption of metanauplii was reduced. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n73 \n\nFor a prey concentration of 1 prey ml\n-1\n\n, consumption of Naup and Meta were identical \n\nbut were higher than consumption of MetaAlga and MetaSpi. Finally, for the two \n\nhighest prey densities, significantly more Naup were consumed than Meta which was, \n\nin turn, consumed in higher quantities than MetaAlga and MetaSpi (P &lt;0.001). There \n\nwas no significant difference (P > 0.972) in the number of ingested enriched \n\nmetanauplii at all tested prey densities (Figure 2). Concerning Zoea II, number of prey \n\ningested did not also differ among prey types when these were provided at the lowest \n\nconcentration  (17.2 \u00b1 2.7, 19.4 \u00b1 0.9, 19.2 \u00b1 0.8, and 19.2 \u00b1 0.8 Naup, Meta, MetaAlga \n\nand MetaSpi, respectively; Figure 2). However, under the two highest prey densities \n\nconsumption of Naup was always significantly lower (P &lt;0.001) than that of all \n\nmetanauplii. Under all tested prey densities, consumption of Meta, MetaAlga and \n\nMetaSpi was always similar (P > 0.999) (Figure 2). Finally, larval feeding ability was \n\nsignificantly different between both zoeal stages, with first zoeae consuming less prey \n\nthan second zoeae (stage; df = 1, F = 3802.3; P &lt;0.001). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: Prey consumption of N. norvegicus ZI and ZII under different prey densities and prey type \nafter a 24 h period. Prey concentration is expressed as the number of prey ml\n\n-1\n. Tested prey types \n\nwere Artemia nauplii (Naup), metanauplii (Meta), metanauplii enriched with Algamac\u2122 2000 \n(MetaAlga) and Spirulina (MetaSpi). Error bars represent standard error. Different letters represent \nsignificantly different feeding rates \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n74 \n\n3.4.3 Effect of previous feeding histories \n\nA significant effect of feeding history was recorded for both stages (ANOVA, Z1:df = 5, \n\nF = 1116.13; P &lt;0.001; Z2: df = 5, F =  1873.40; P &lt;0.001).  Larvae of either stage \n\npreviously starved for 12 h always consumed more prey than those allowed to feed \n\nunder higher or lower prey densities during the acclimation period (Figure 3). \n\nHowever, exposing larvae to a higher (5 prey ml\n-1\n\n) or lower (0.5 prey ml\n-1\n\n) prey \n\nconcentration during the acclimation period promoted different feeding responses by \n\nlarvae subsequently placed under high or low food conditions (Figure 3). Zoeae \n\nacclimated to low and high food concentrations did not show differences in the \n\nnumber of prey consumed (P > 0.999) when subsequently placed under low food \n\nconcentrations (8.8 \u00b1 0.4, and 9.2 \u00b1 0.8 Naup consumed by ZI and 8.8 \u00b1 1.3 and \n\n9.0 \u00b1 1.0 MetaAlga consumed by ZII, respectively). In contrast, larvae acclimated to low \n\nfood conditions consumed significantly more prey (P &lt;0.001) than those acclimated to \n\nhigh food densities, when subsequently placed in high food conditions (69.4 \u00b1 2.4 and \n\n56.6 \u00b1 4.7 Naup consumed by ZI, and 97.2s \u00b1 4.1 and 84.4 \u00b1 3.8 MetaAlga consumed by \n\nZII, respectively; Figure 3).  \n\n \n\n3.5 Discussion \n\nIn this study, larval prey consumption increased with prey density (from 0.5 to 5 \n\nprey ml\n-1\n\n). The number of prey ingested did not reach a plateau suggesting that \n\nmaximum prey consumption was not reached and would probably only be attained at \n\nhigher prey densities. Successful culture of N. norvegicus larvae to the juvenile stage is \n\npossible using a diet of enriched Artemia sp. metanauplii, although survival to \n\nmetamorphosis is always low (Anger and Puschel 1986; Dickey-Collas et al. 2000b; \n\nFigueiredo and Vilela 1972). In the present study it is possible that larval energetic \n\nrequirements were not fulfilled. A lack of satiation is consistent with the observed \n\nlinear increase in the number of ingested prey and supports the general belief that \n\nArtemia sp. is an inferior diet when compared to natural plankton (e.g. copepods), \n\n(Helland et al.  2003; Shields et al.  1999;  Sorgeloos et  al. 1998).  As a result,  energetic \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n75 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3: Prey consumption of N. norvegicus larvae under different prey densities previously \nacclimated to different prey densities after a 12 h period. The right (A) and left (B) figure depict the \nnumber of Atremia sp. consumed by Zoea 1 and Zoea 2, respectively. Low and high prey concentration \nrepresent densities of 0.5 and 5.0 Artemia sp. ml\n\n-1\n, respectively. Zoea I and II were offered nauplii and \n\nmetanauplii, respectively. Error bars represent standard error. For each zoeal stage separately, \ndifferent letters represent significantly different feeding rates. \n\n \n\nneeds were not met. In this way, if the present study had been performed using \n\nnatural food items the tested prey densities may have promoted different results and \n\nfood intake at higher densities would have stabilize at a saturation prey density. \n\nHowever, further experiment is needed to support this hypothesis.  \n\nAlthough consumption under low prey density was not affected by prey type or larval \n\nstage, larval ingestion under higher prey densities was influenced by these two factors. \n\nConcerning ZI, the smaller size and inferior swimming speed of Artemia sp. nauplii can \n\nexplain the higher consumption recorded for this type of prey, when compared to \n\nmetanauplii. The lower consumption of enriched metanauplii, in comparison to \n\nunenriched ones, was probably due to their higher nutritional value, since unenriched \n\nand enriched metanauplii displayed similar sizes and swimming speeds. Feeding on \n\nenriched metanauplii may have caused ZI to reach satiation faster than when ingesting \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n76 \n\na similar number of less nutritive unenriched metanauplii. Therefore, the present \n\nresults suggest that the nutritional value of food items in a plankton patch will directly \n\ninfluence the number of prey ingested by ZI of N. norvegicus. The quality of a prey item \n\nis likely to vary with its nutritional state and this in turn affects larval feeding on that \n\nitem (Dalsgaard et al. 2003). Therefore, larvae at the same development stage (thus \n\nwith identical predatory ability) will capture and ingest different numbers of the same \n\ndietary item dwelling in a plankton patch, as a function of its nutritional value.  \n\nRegarding ZII, these larvae clearly displayed a preference for larger prey, eating \n\nsignificantly more metanauplii than nauplii. The small sized Artemia sp. nauplii did not \n\ntrigger a proper predatory response and promoted lower prey consumption. In larval \n\ndecapods it is not unusual to record a shift in larval prey\u2019s preference during \n\ndevelopment, with early stages preferring smaller food items, while later stages switch \n\ntowards larger prey (McConaugha et al. 1991). Nonetheless, larger stages continue to \n\ningest smaller prey if these are available (Harvey and Epifanio 1997), although larvae \n\nbecome increasingly selective at higher prey densities (Y\u00fafera et al. 1984). In \n\nopposition to ZI, larvae in the second zoeal stage ingested similar numbers of enriched \n\nand unenriched Artemia sp. metanauplii. This similar feeding response to metanauplii \n\nmay have been promoted by the fact that with neither prey types the larvae were able \n\nto reach satiation. Apparently, N. norvegicus ZII require larger and/or more nutritious \n\ndietary prey. In the wild this feeding response will result in a lower energetic intake if \n\nlarvae dwell in a plankton patch dominated by prey with \u201clow nutritional quality\u201d. It is \n\npossible that numerous dietary prey types can be available in a plankton patch but that \n\nthe one available at the highest concentration is not nutritionally balanced to support \n\noptimal zooplankton growth. Ultimately, these prey may occur at high concentration \n\nbecause they are avoided by predating larvae (Mitra and Flynn 2006b). At least under \n\nculture conditions, the nutritional inadequacy of prey items can result in partial \n\nstarvation and promote lower growth and survival (Harvey and Epifanio 1997). If \n\ndeveloping N. norvegicus larvae are regularly exposed to suboptimal dietary prey, \n\nwhich they will ingest to avoid starvation, the resulting nutritional stress may still \n\ninduce larval mortality. Therefore, in order to develop successfully, larvae must \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n77 \n\nregularly have at their disposal not only suitable numbers of dietary items, but also \n\nnutritionally balanced prey. \n\nZoeal stages of decapods are not capable of long periods of sustained horizontal \n\nswimming and may not be able to remain in food patches (Harden Jones 1980). This \n\nconstraint will probably impair larvae to feed continuously throughout their ontogenic \n\ndevelopment (Pitchford et al. 2003). In the present research, early stage N. norvegicus \n\nlarvae increased the number of prey consumed after previously experiencing food \n\ndeprivation or low prey abundance. These feeding behaviors may allow N. norvegicus \n\nlarvae to overcome intermittent periods of starvation, or suboptimal feeding levels, \n\ncaused by the natural patchiness of plankton and abundance of suitable prey. A similar \n\nreaction would be expected in response to changes in food conditions due to variable \n\nprey composition caused by diel vertical migration of zooplankton (Forward 1988).  \n\nAlthough both zoeal stages displayed distinct prey preferences, larvae readily ingested \n\nall types of tested prey, even if these were \u201csuboptimal\u201d (e.g. the consumption of \n\nArtemia sp. nauplii by ZII). Adjacent plankton patches are not always similar in their \n\nspecies composition, and these may vary in terms of prey shape, size, quantity and \n\nquality (Petrone et al. 2005). The plasticity displayed by N. norvegicus larvae, in terms \n\nof prey types ingested, may therefore be an important adaptation to pelagic life. Even \n\nthough N. norvegicus larvae yolk reserves may differ spatially and seasonally (Rotlland \n\net al. 2004), they do not exhibit primary lecithotrophy, being unable to advance to \n\nZoea II in the absence of food (personal observation). In that sense, and as suggested \n\nby modeling studies (Gentleman et al. 2003; Mitra and Flynn 2006a), the capability to \n\nmaximize food intake when prey are available, regardless of their type or quality, can \n\ntemporarily reduce the effects of starvation in oligotrophic winter conditions until \n\nsuitable prey are available. In contrast, when the hatching of N. norvegicus occurs at \n\nthe time of the spring bloom, and prey items are more abundant and varied (dos \n\nSantos et al. 2007), adequate prey are more likely to be available for newly hatched \n\nand developing larvae. In that sense, optimal foraging theory would predict that a \n\npredator adopts the feeding behavior that generates the highest intake rate of energy, \n\nwith the consumption of suboptimal prey being highly reduced (Ki\u00f8rboe et al. 1996). \n\nHowever, no study has ever addressed the existence of potential morphological and \n\n\n\nLarval feeding of N.norvegicus  \n\n78 \n\nbehavioral constraints in N. norvegicus larvae that may mask and/or preclude optimal \n\nforaging. In this way, the present results and those from previous laboratorial studies \n\naddressing the feeding of Norway lobster larvae should be extrapolated with caution \n\nto a pelagic environment with complex plankton patches dynamics. \n\nLarval feeding ability was affected by photoperiod duration, with the number of \n\ningested prey being consistently superior when 12 h of light were employed, \n\nregardless of prey density or larval stage. However, responses to light may vary \n\nsignificantly during larval development of decapods (Bermudes and Ritar 2008). \n\nSeveral studies on crustacean larvae (Calado et al. 2008; Gardner and Maguire 1998; \n\nStarkweather 1976; Teschke et al. 2007), and especially spiny lobsters (Bermudes and \n\nRitar 2008; Bermudes et al. 2008; Mikami and Greenwood 1997), have demonstrated \n\nthat food intake, survival and molt stage duration are positively impacted by the \n\npresence of any kind of periodic light regime. Although decapod larvae are good \n\nswimmers, true hunting behaviors (e.g. prey chasing) are not displayed and these \n\norganisms solely rely on chance encounters with dietary prey (Epelbaum and Borisov \n\n2006; Gonor and Gonor 1973). This feeding behavior has been termed by Berkes \n\n(1975) as \u201cencounter feeding\u201d. Since swimming activity of many decapods increases in \n\nthe presence of light (Forward et al. 1984; Sulkin 1984), larvae will have increased \n\nchances of encountering dietary prey. However, constant illumination will increase \n\nenergy expenditure and therefore reduce survivorship since larvae remain \n\npermanently active in the laboratory (Calado et al. 2008; Dawirs 1982). Although under \n\nconstant darkness feeding remained possible, despite a lower consumption rate, 24 h \n\nof light did not promote higher prey ingestion than 12  h of light. These results seem to \n\nindicate that N. norvegicus larvae may also feed during the dark:light interface, as \n\nalready suggested for spiny lobsters larvae (Bermudes and Ritar 2008). Apparently, the \n\noccurrence of a light:dark phase optimizes larval growth and feeding performances, \n\nregardless of the duration of the light phase, suggesting that the transition between \n\nday and night plays a greater role rather than the duration of the photoperiod itself \n\n(Bermudes and Ritar 2008; Bermudes et al. 2008; Starkweather 1976).  \n\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that unsatiated N. norvegicus \n\nlarvae are able to increase prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n79 \n\nhigher food abundance. The feeding plasticity indicates that early stage larvae may be \n\nable to withstand and recover from periods of suboptimal food conditions by switching \n\nprey preference and increasing consumption once optimal foraging conditions are \n\nencountered. Both prey availability and prey size play a crucial role in the \n\ntrophodynamics of developing N. norvegicus larvae. Extreme photoperiods resulted in \n\nlower prey consumption for both larval stages and their use in N. norvegicus \n\nlarviculture is not recommended.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors thank Dr. M.

The \n\neffect of suboptimal feeding on digestive enzymes activity of N. norvegicus larvae \n\nduring this early period of their larval life remains unknown. Protease and amylase \n\nactivity was investigated ex situ using flurometry in laboratory hatched larvae exposed \n\nto different feeding and/or starving scenarios in the 24 h following hatching, the \n\nperiod during which they typically accomplish their upward vertical migration. \n\nAmylase activity was very low in comparison to protease activity, indicating that \n\ncarbohydrates are not a primary energy reserve. Larvae starved for 12h and \n\nsubsequently fed displayed no increase in amylase activity, which suggests that \n\nfeeding may be required before 12h post-hatch to trigger amylase activity. Protease \n\nactivity was high under all feeding conditions and the increase of protease activity \n\nunder sustained starvation indicated the catabolism of protein reserves. The ability of \n\nfirst stage N. norvegicus larvae to metabolize protein reserves may play a decisive role \n\nfor their survival during their first vertical migration, as it enables them to overcome \n\nthe deleterious effects of short-term starvation and/or suboptimal feeding. \n\n \n\n4.2 Introduction \n\nThe Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially \n\nimportant benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in Northeastern Atlantic \n\nwaters, from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco, and in the Mediterranean Sea \n\n(d\u2019Udekem d\u2019Acoz 1999). After embryonic incubation on the female abdomen, larvae \n\nare released from the eggs, which then develop through three zoeal planktonic stages, \n\neach intermolt period lasting about 10 days at 10\u00baC (Figueiredo and Vilela 1972), and \n\nthen migrate back to the bottom as a post-larva before settling on the benthos as a \n\njuvenile. The adult depth range varies from 15 to 800 m, although they are typically \n\nfound on the NE Atlantic coast between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. 1997a) and \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n91 \n\n200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sard\u00e0 1997). In addition to \n\ndifferences in the depth range, the reproduction period of this species also varies with \n\nlatitude, as average embryo incubation period lasts up to 10 months in the \n\nNortheastern Atlantic and only 6 months in the Mediterranean Sea (Sard\u00e0 1995). \n\nThese latitudinal differences affect the timing of larval hatching in N. norvegicus , with \n\nlarval release occurring by early spring in the Northeastern Atlantic and at the end of \n\nwinter in the Mediterranean (Rotllant et al. 2004). Off the Coast of Portugal, adult \n\nNorway lobsters occur at depths ranging from 400 to 800 m and larval hatching period \n\nis known to take place from December to April (dos Santos and Peliz 2005). In this \n\nway, while larvae hatching at the end of winter will face a nutritionally poor \n\nenvironment, larvae hatching a few months later will overlap with the beginning of \n\nthermal stratification and the spring bloom [chlorophyll a peaks, and therefore \n\nzooplankton blooms (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita 2001)].  \n\nApart from seasonal variations, the depth where larval hatching takes place may also \n\nplay a role in food availability. N. norvegicus larvae hatch below 300 m depth off the \n\nPortuguese coast (dos Santos and Peliz 2005) and at these depths larval prey may not \n\nbe available to fulfill the nutritional needs of first stage N. norvegicus larvae. In fact, it \n\nis possible that suitable prey may only be available once these larvae reach the upper \n\nregions of the water column (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). After hatching, N. \n\nnorvegicus larvae are known to migrate vertically to the photic zone, as stage I larvae \n\nhave already been recorded in Portuguese waters at depths as low as 60-70 m (dos \n\nSantos and Peliz 2005). This aspect of N. norvegicus early life cycle may translate into \n\na potential period of suboptimal feeding, or even post-hatching starvation.  \n\nLarvae of N. norvegicus are capable of maximizing food intake when prey are \n\navailable, regardless of their type or quality, and therefore can temporarily attenuate \n\nthe deleterious effects of starvation (Pochelon et al. 2009a). Although the analysis of \n\nlate stage embryos of homarid lobsters has revealed that newly hatched larvae still \n\ncontain considerable energetic reserves (Pandian 1970a, b; Rosa et al. 2005; Rosa et \n\n\n\nEnzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea \n\n92 \n\nal. 2003), these organisms may not recover from nutritional stress if suitable prey are \n\nnot available soon after hatching (Anger et al. 1985; Rotllant et al. 2001). \n\nIn this way, the study of digestive enzymes can help clarify how first stage larvae of N. \n\nnorvegicus cope with the potential absence of suitable prey at great depths, as well as \n\nduring their ontogenetic migration towards food-richer environments in ocean upper \n\nlayers. Digestive enzymes dynamics during periods of starvation (or suboptimal \n\nfeeding) indicate which nutrients act as energy reserves and which are preferentially \n\ncatabolized (Johnston 2003; Johnston et al. 2004; Jones et al. 1997; Kamarudin et al. \n\n1994; Lovett and Felder 1990b; Rotllant et al. 2010). For instance, high protease \n\nactivity is indicative of protein catabolism, while amylase activity indicates the \n\nconsumption of carbohydrates (Johnston 2003; Kamarudin et al. 1994). It is not \n\nconsensual whether proteins play the major role as energy sources to fuel decapod \n\nlarvae during starvation (Anger 2001; Johnston et al. 2004), since lipids also appear to \n\nbe catabolized when larvae are deprived of food (Ritar et al. 2003a). However, lipase \n\nactivity has been shown not to be significantly affected during either feeding or \n\nstarvation of the first larval stage of nephropid lobsters (Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990a, \n\nb). The nutritional relevance of carbohydrates for decapods crustaceans is still not \n\nfully understood, as marine decapods are not able to efficiently store carbohydrates \n\nreserves (S\u00e1nchez-Paz et al. 2006). Nonetheless, it has been suggested that amylase \n\nmay play other metabolic roles, which still need further investigation, than simply \n\ncatabolizing carbohydrates (Jones et al. 1997). By studying amylase activity in \n\ncarnivorous larvae, it may be possible to understand why this enzyme is commonly \n\nactive in these organisms in spite of the scarcity of its substrate.  \n\nSo far, no study has ever investigated the shifts in digestive enzyme activity of N. \n\nnorvegicus larvae exposed to various periods of starvation and/or feeding during their \n\nfirst hours of life, during which they perform their first vertical migration. In this way, \n\nthe objective of the present research was to determine through laboratory \n\nexperiment the protease and amylase activity in first stage N. norvegicus in response \n\nto extended and intermittent periods of starvation and feeding (lipase activity was not \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n93 \n\nconsidered in the present study, as it is known not to be significantly affected by food \n\nintake in the first larval stage of other nephropid lobsters; Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990a; \n\nBiesiot and Capuzzo 1990b). The experimental feeding regimes selected in the present \n\nwork aim to simulate different feeding scenarios that N. norvegicus larvae may \n\nexperience during their vertical migration from deeper to shallower waters. \n\n \n\n4.3 Materials and Methods \n\n4.3.1 Larval production \n\nOvigerous N. norvegicus were collected between February and April 2008 using \n\ncommercial baited traps off Peniche (West Coast of Portugal), at an approximate \n\ndepth of 400 m, and stocked in the laboratory. Ovigerous females were held in \n\nindividual aquaria (0.4 m x 0.2 m x 0.3 m ? 24 L) placed in a temperature controlled \n\nroom (15\u00b11\u00baC), until their larvae hatched. Larval release always occurred within a \n\nweek from capture and females were therefore not fed prior to hatching. Natural \n\nseawater was used, at a salinity of 35. Seawater was 1 \u00b5m filtered, passed through \n\nactivated carbon and UV irradiated before being used. About one third of the volume \n\nof each broodstock aquarium was replaced by new filtered seawater every other day. \n\n4.3.2 Larval feeding trials \n\nWithin one hour of hatching, N. norvegicus larvae were removed from the aquaria \n\nusing a plastic cup and randomly distributed across the eight experimental trials and a \n\ncontrol. Only those specimens displaying strong phototactic responses were selected \n\nfor the experimental trials, since this behavior is commonly employed in crustacean \n\naquaculture to evaluate larval quality (see Treece and Fox 1993). Larvae were sampled \n\nfor later enzyme analysis at the end of a set period under predefined conditions. \n\nThose included, a control group of newly hatched (NH) larvae sampled immediately \n\nafter hatching, larvae collected 6, 12 and 24 h after hatching in either continuous \n\nstarvation or feeding (S6, S12, S24, F6, F12 and F24, respectively), and two \u201cmixed\u201d \n\ntreatments where larvae were sampled 24 h after being initially starved for 12 h and \n\n\n\nEnzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea \n\n94 \n\nfed on the following 12 h; or being initially fed for the first 12 h and subsequently \n\nstarved in the next 12 h (S12F12 and F12S12, respectively). For each of the nine \n\ngroups, 15 larvae were placed individually in 40 mL plastic beakers with filtered \n\nseawater at a salinity of 35 in a climatized chamber at 15\u00b11\u00baC under constant \n\ndarkness (to prevent larval prey from grouping at the surface of the beaker due to \n\ntheir positive phototaxis). Larvae in the feeding treatments were provided with newly \n\nhatched Artemia sp. nauplii (San Francisco Bay Brand Inc., Newark, CA, USA) at a \n\ndensity of 5 nauplii mL-1, with Artemia sp. cysts being incubated according to the \n\nprocedures described by Sorgeloos et al. (1998). To ensure a homogenized \n\ndistribution of prey in the water column during the experimental trials, each plastic \n\nbeaker was gently aerated at a rate of ca. one air bubble per second.  \n\nAt the end of each experimental trial, larvae were stored for later enzyme analyses, as \n\ndescribed by Rotllant et al. (2008). In brief, larvae were gently dried on filter paper \n\nand individually placed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf before being freeze-dried and stored at -\n\n32\u00baC for later analysis. Prior to enzymes analysis, each larva was homogenized in 100 \n\n\u00b5L of distilled water and sonicated in an ice bath with three short pulses of 2 s (Vibra-\n\ncell., Sonics, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4\u00baC. \n\nThe supernatant was kept on ice and used for the analysis of amylase and protease \n\nactivity, as well as larval protein content. \n\n4.3.3 Amylase activity \n\nThe homogenate to quantify amylase activity was diluted to 1:50 in the case of larvae \n\nfed for 6, 12 and 24 h, and 1:10 for all other treatments. From this diluted sample 50 \n\ne along with in 50 ?l of a working substrate (prepared \n\nfollowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol \u201cEnzCheck\n\u00ae\n Ultra Amylase Assey Kit\u201d *E33651; \n\nMolecular Probes\n\u00ae\n]) was used for the analysis. Fluorescence was measured at 485 nm \n\n(excitation) and 535 nm (emission) for 10 min at 30\u00baC. Samples were assayed in \n\nduplicates. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n95 \n\n4.3.4 Protease analysis \n\nTo quantify protease activity 100 \u00b5L of Tris-HCl 0.1 M pH 8.0 and 10 \u00b5L of fluorescent \n\ncasein (C-2990_25mg; Molecular Probes\n\u00ae\n) were added to 10 \u00b5L of the homogenate \n\nand incubated for 1 h at 37\u00baC. The reaction was then stopped by adding 30 \u00b5L of TCA \n\n20%. The reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 12500 rpm at 4\u00baC and 50\u00b5L of the \n\nsupernatant was added to a microplate along with 200 \u00b5L of Tris-HCl 0.5M pH 8.5. \n\nFluorescence was measured at 485 nm (excitation) and 538 nm (emission) for 20 ms \n\nat 30\u00baC. Samples were assayed in duplicates. Additionally, a blank was conducted for \n\neach sample where the homogenate was added to the substrate and buffer after the \n\nreaction has been stopped. The measured value of the blank was then subtracted to \n\ncorrect the value of the samples (Rotllant et al. 2010).  \n\n4.3.5 Protein analysis \n\nIn order to standardize enzymatic activity data, the latter was expressed as specific \n\nactivity (RFU/min/?g prt). Protein content was measured in the homogenates as \n\ndescribed by Bradford (1976) using Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent (BioRad 500- \n\n0205) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7906) as the standard. Samples were \n\nassayed placing 15 \u00b5L of the homogenate in a 48 flat bottom transparent microplates \n\nwith 985 \u00b5L Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent (BioRad 500- 0205) and read at 595 nm \n\n4.3.6 Statistical analysis \n\nDifferences between each treatment in both per individual and specific enzymes \n\nactivity were compared. Given that all larvae survived through the experimental \n\nperiod, the number of larvae employed on enzymatic analysis was identical to the \n\nones used on each feeding trial (n=15). Due to the non-normality of the data a \n\nKruskal-Wallis test was used (Zar 1999) followed by a non-parametric post-hoc tests \n\ncomparing mean rank of all pairs of groups (Siegel and Castellan 1988). All tests were \n\nperformed using STATISTICA 8.0 (manufactured by StatSoft Inc., USA). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEnzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea \n\n96 \n\n4.4 Results \n\nTotal amylase activity of first stage N. norvegicus larvae varied significantly with the \n\nfeeding regime (Kruskal-Wallis test, H138 =85.1, P<0.001). Total amylase activity was \n\nnot significantly different (post-hoc tests, P>0.24) between newly hatched (NH) and \n\npermanently starved larvae (S6, S12 and S24), nor from that displayed by larvae under \n\nfed/starved treatments (S12F12 and F12S12) (Figure 1a). A significant increase in total \n\namylase activity was however observed in constantly fed larvae (post-hoc tests, \n\nP<0.009). After 6 h of feeding, amylase total activity was similar to that recorded for \n\nlarvae in the F12S12 treatment (post-hoc tests, P>0.9). Highest total amylase activity \n\nwas found after 12 h or more of continuous feeding, with both F12 and F24 larvae \n\ndisplaying significantly higher activity than all other groups (post-hoc tests, P<0.03), \n\nwith the exception of F6 larvae (post-hoc test, P>0.9). Finally, larvae in the S12F12 \n\ntreatment displayed levels of total amylase activity similar to those of starved larvae \n\n(post-hoc tests, P<0.48) and significantly lower than that of F12 larvae (post-hoc test, \n\nP>0.03).  \n\nTotal protease activity displayed by larvae exposed to different feeding regimes was \n\nmore variable (Figure 2a), although significant differences were still recorded (Kruskal-\n\nWallis test, H143=39.37, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between NH, \n\nstarved larvae (S6, S12 and S24), F6 and both fed/starved treatments (S12F12 and \n\nF12S12; post-hoc tests, P>0.39). Additionally, total protease activity was similar for \n\nlarvae in the S24, F6, F12, F24, S12F12 and F12S12 feeding treatments (post-hoc tests, \n\nP >0.9). With time, a slight, however not statistically significant increase in total \n\nprotease activity was observed either in constantly fed (F6, F12 and F24) or constantly \n\nstarved (S6, S12 and S24) larvae.  \n\nResults of statistical analysis of the specific protease and amylase activity was almost \n\nidentical to per individual activity, indicating that soluble protein content was constant \n\namong most experimental treatments (Figure 1b and 2b). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n97 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: Nephrops norvegicus: Boxplot depicting a) total amylase activity (RFU/Ind/min) and b) \n\nspecific amylase activity (RFU/min/?g prt) for first stage larvae under different feeding regimes \n(n=15).

Amylase activity was \n\nsignificantly lower in first stage larvae experiencing food deprivation, either \n\n\n\nEnzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea \n\n98 \n\ncontinuously or semi-continuously (\u201cmixed\u201d treatments S12F12 and F12S12) than in \n\nthe continuously fed treatments. As expected, these results confirm that \n\ncarbohydrates are not the main energetic reserve fueling larval metabolism during \n\nperiods of starvation. Additionally, the results of the S12F12 treatment indicated that \n\nlarvae initially exposed to starvation do not recover amylase activity even after \n\nfeeding, as those larvae exhibited significantly lower amylase activity than conspecifics \n\ncontinuously fed for 12 h. In this way, it is possible that the ingestion of carbohydrates \n\nby N. norvegicus immediately after hatching may be required to trigger \u201cnormal\u201d \n\namylase activity. If first stage larvae are exposed to a period of food deprivation, and \n\nconsequently fail to trigger amylase activity, it is possible that those specimens will no \n\nlonger be able to digest carbohydrates efficiently, at least on a short term basis. Since \n\nthe present study only focused the first 24 h post-hatching, during which the first \n\nvertical larval migration is performed, further studies are needed to assess the long \n\nterm effects of reduced amylase activity in developing larvae. Two outcomes are \n\npossible: 1) amylase activity will recover with long term sustained feeding or; 2) larvae \n\nwill not be able to overcome the deleterious effects of early starvation and their \n\nsurvival will be negatively affected [as it is speculated that amylase may play other \n\nmetabolic roles than simply catabolizing carbohydrates (Jones et al. 1997)]. The \n\nassumption of deleterious effects resulting from early larval starvation is supported by \n\nseveral works addressing other decapod species, on which first stage larvae are \n\nunable to successfully molt to the next larval stage if optimal feeding does not occur \n\nduring the first 24-48 h (Calado et al. 2007a; Gim\u00e9nez 2002; Rotllant et al. 2010). \n\nAdditionally, free carbohydrates, in the form of glucose, are known to play a critical \n\nrole in energy metabolism, and carbohydrates are needed for the formation of the \n\nlarval exoskeleton (Anger 2001). When larvae were continuously fed, there was a \n\ngradual increase over time in amylase activity. Results of the F12S12 treatment \n\nsuggest that the carbohydrates are rapidly digested, as already recorded for the early \n\nlarval stages of the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii (Ritar et al. 2003a). Indeed, at the \n\nend of that treatment, amylase activity dropped back to levels similar to those of \n\nstarved larvae.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n99 \n\nAll fed larvae, including the ones in the mixed treatments (S12F12 and F12S12), had \n\nhigher levels of protease activity than NH, S6 and S12. However, larvae starved for 24 \n\nh exhibited levels of protease activity comparable to those observed for fed larvae. As \n\nlarvae hatching at great depths are unlikely that to be able to feed abundantly before \n\nreaching the upper part of the water column (Yamaguchi et al. 2005), first stage N. \n\nnorvegicus probably display some type of mechanisms that able them to cope with \n\npost-hatching short-term food deprivation. The present work revealed that protease is \n\nactive immediately after hatching and that starved larvae display an increasing \n\nprotease activity over time. High protease activity may enable N. norvegicus larvae to \n\nrapidly extract protein from food once it becomes available. This strategy is commonly \n\nexhibited by decapod larvae, as it allows them to maximize the energetic intake under \n\nscenarios of intermittent starvation caused by prey patchiness (Le Vay et al. 2001). In \n\nan oligotrophic environment, such as the deep sea, the ability of first stage decapods \n\nto rapidly and efficiently digest any available prey prior to their arrival to shallower \n\nwaters would certainly be an advantageous trait. \n\nSpecific enzyme activity recorded for larvae exposed to different feeding regimes was \n\nsimilar to total enzyme activity. In the S24 treatment, specific protease activity was \n\nlower than in the S12 treatment which might indicate that protein reserves start being \n\nused to endure food deprivation. Nevertheless, the lack of difference between specific \n\nand absolute activity results, indicate that protein reserves are not significantly \n\ndepleted after 24 h of starvation and suggest that N. norvegicus larvae can survive \n\nover 24 h without any exogenous protein supply. In a previous study, the soluble \n\nprotein content recorded for first stage N. norvegicus larvae from Mediterranean and \n\nIrish Sea populations (Rotllant et al. 2004) were between 2 to 3 times higher than that \n\nmeasured in the present study for Portuguese larvae. This is not surprising, as regional \n\ndifferences have already been observed in embryonic lipid and protein content in \n\nvarious decapods (Bas et al. 2007; Rosa et al. 2007a; Silva et al. 2009). Additionally, \n\nbrood variability in yolk reserves may also play a decisive role in the ability of first \n\nstage larvae to endure starvation. Brood variability has already been documented for \n\nother nephropid lobsters, such as H. americanus (Anger et al. 1985; Pandian 1970b) \n\n\n\nEnzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea \n\n100 \n\nand H. gammarus (Moland et al. 2010; Wickins et al. 1995). A preliminary study \n\naddressing N. norvegicus also revealed significant within brood variability on the fatty \n\nacid profiles of developing embryos (Pochelon et al. 2009b). This finding, coupled with \n\nlaboratorial observations of larvae from a single brood hatching over several \n\nconsecutive days [as already reported for Homarus spp. (Pandian 1970b; Wickins et al. \n\n1995)], indicate that N. norvegicus larvae will probably also display variable energetic \n\nreserves at hatching. This aspect has not been investigated so far in N. norvegicus \n\nlarvae and may be of paramount importance for the survival of first stage larvae \n\nduring their first vertical migration from deep to shallower waters.  \n\nIn summary, first stage N. norvegicus larvae off the Coast of Portugal, hatching \n\nbetween 400 and 800 m deep, need to perform a vertical migration through the water \n\ncolumn towards food rich upper layers. The urgency of this behavioral response to \n\navoid the negative effects of starvation is emphasized by the relatively lower protein \n\nreserves present in studied larvae, when compared to Mediterranean and Irish Sea \n\nconspecifics. The present results indicated that, even though there seems to be a \n\ndeleterious effect of starvation on amylase activity, at least on a short timescale, post-\n\nhatching starvation does not seem to affect the onset of protease activity. If suitable \n\npreys are not ingested in 12-24 h post-hatching, larval protein reserves will start to be \n\ncatabolized to fulfill energetic demands. Although lipase activity does not seem to be \n\naffected by post-hatching starvation in H. americanus (a shallow water nephropid \n\nlobster related to N. norvegicus) (Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990b), it has already been \n\nshown that several decapod larvae catabolize lipids during periods of food shortage \n\n[e.g.: the lobster Jasus edwardsii (Johnston et al. 2004; Ritar et al. 2003a), the \n\nanomuran crabs Lithodes santolla and Paralomis granulosa (Kattner et al. 2003) and \n\npenaeid shrimp (D'Abramo 1989)]. In this way, future studies should investigate if \n\nlipase activity during post hatching starvation in N. norvegicus follows the pattern \n\nidentified for shallow water nephropid lobsters (no significant changes in lipase \n\nactivity) or the one displayed by other decapod crustaceans (significant changes in \n\nlipase activity). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n101 \n\nThe long term consequences of suboptimal feeding immediately after hatching were \n\nnot tested in the present study. Therefore, additional work is required to clarify if \n\nmetamorphosis and post-settlement performance of N. norvegicus can be negatively \n\naffected by suboptimal feeding during the first vertical migration of larvae. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors thank Susana Pereira and Marta Sastre for their help during the sampling \n\nand processing of Norway lobster larvae.

Abundance and distribution of \n\nzoea I and II were correlated during both years. For all stages, abundance decreased \n\nwith depth during the day while it increased with depth at night; the larvae thus \n\ndisplayed reverse diel vertical migration. Abundance of zoea I and II was correlated \n\nwith chlorophyll a levels, whereas those of later stages where correlated with neither \n\nphysical parameters (chlorophyll a, temperature or salinity), nor with each other. An \n\nontogenic shift in vertical distribution explained the results; earlier zoeal stages \n\nremain in the food-rich upper water column while later stages migrate to the bottom \n\nfor settlement. \n\n \n\n5.2 Introduction \n\nDescribing the distribution, abundance and dispersal of larvae of deep-sea animals is a \n\ndaunting task. The small sizes of the larvae and the very large volumes of ocean into \n\nwhich they may potentially disperse present difficult logistical and technical \n\nconstraints (Tyler and Young 1999). In one of the most successful field studies of deep-\n\nsea larval distribution, Mullineaux et al. (1995)used a MOCNESS system to sample a \n\nneutrally buoyant plume over the Juan de Fuca Ridge  Larvae of vent gastropods and \n\nbivalves attenuated very rapidly outside the plume, illustrating the difficulty of \n\nsampling highly dilute larvae in the deep sea.   \n\nDuring two oceanographic cruises conducted off the south coast of Portugal in the \n\nwinters of 2006 and 2007, we collected numerous larvae of the crab Monodaeus \n\ncouchi. This brachyuran crab inhabits muddy substrata (Ingle 1983b) from England to \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n113 \n\nAngola and in the Mediterranean, over a bathymetric range extending from 60 to \n\n1300 m (Gonzalez-Gurriar\u00e1n and M\u00e9ndez G. 1985). It is commonly associated with \n\nmud volcanoes, carbonate chimneys and cold seeps in the Gulf of Cadiz region (Cunha, \n\nM. R., University of Aveiro, unpublished observations). In slope habitats of the \n\nsouthern Iberian Peninsula and of the Mediterranean Sea, the species co-occurs with \n\nthe commercially important Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus (Gonzalez-Gurriar\u00e1n \n\nand M\u00e9ndez G. 1985; Maynou and Sard\u00e0 1997). Although not strictly a deep-sea \n\nspecies, it may provide a good model for the understanding some aspects of the larval \n\necology of deep-sea decapod crustaceans.  \n\nSo far, field evidence on the factors that regulate dispersal of decapod larvae have \n\nbeen mostly based on studies of estuarine and coastal species (DeVries et al. 1994; \n\nDiBacco et al. 2001; Epifanio and Garvine 2001; Rothlisberg et al. 1995) and much less \n\non offshore sampling programs (e.g. dos Santos and Peliz 2005; Lindley 1986). These \n\nstudies, which include laboratory studies, demonstrate a commonality of behaviors \n\nwith respect to feeding, predator avoidance, swimming and vertical migration \n\n(reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005). Many life-cycle traits are phylogenetically \n\nconserved in deep-sea species (Eckelbarger and Watling 1995; Tyler and Young 1999; \n\nTyler and Young 2003; Young 2003). Therefore, we would expect that at least some of \n\nthe selective pressures and adaptations exhibited by larvae of shallow water decapods \n\nwill also apply in general to deep-water species. Most decapod larvae are herbivores \n\nand/or carnivores (Anger 2001) and, therefore, must feed in surface layers. For deep-\n\nsea crab larvae a migration towards the surface would necessitate considerable \n\nenergetic investment because crab larvae are negatively buoyant (Queiroga and \n\nBlanton 2005). However, crab larvae are relatively strong swimmers capable of \n\nsustaining velocities on the order of 0.5 to 2.0 cm s\n-1\n\n ((Chia et al. 1984; Mileikovsky \n\n1973), and could move over a vertical distance of 1000 m in a relatively short time.  \n\nHowever, feeding in surface waters would expose them to a higher predation pressure \n\nthan in the relatively protected environment of the deep-sea, and would require a \n\nreturn migration to deep waters at the end of planktonic life. Moreover, a distribution \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n114 \n\nin surface waters may also have considerable consequences for horizontal dispersal \n\nand for recruitment into appropriate habitats. \n\nInformation on larval distributions is rare for deep-sea crabs. In this short note we \n\ndescribe the distribution, abundance and vertical migration of Monodaeus couchi \n\nlarvae in the Gulf of Cadiz. We show that the whole larval series is found in surface \n\nwaters around the high chlorophyll a layer, which is a level commonly associated with \n\nhigh food availability (Verity et al. 2002) and that later stages are found at increasingly \n\ngreater depths. Finally, we describe evidence for a reverse diel migration that may be \n\nrelated to predator avoidance (Han and Straskraba 2001).  \n\n \n\n5.3 Methods \n\n5.3.1 Field collection \n\nPlankton samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises conducted off the \n\nsouth coast of Portugal (Fig. 1a), one from January 29\nth\n\n to February 5\nth\n\n of 2006 (17 \n\nlocations; day: n=7, night: n=10; Fig. 1b) and the other from January 24\nth\n\n to 31\nst \n\nof \n\n2007 (9 locations; day: n=4, night: n=5; Fig. 1c). The sampling areas were located over \n\nthe slope off the coast of Algarve, between Cape St. Maria and the Spanish border, \n\nover depths of 100 to 800 m (Fig. 1b, c). Samples were collected in oblique hauls with \n\na Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) equipped with a 42 cm cone, 280 ?m \n\nmesh net and a flow meter. The water column was resolved into approximately 25 m \n\ndepth strata, from the surface to 10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of \n\n300 m and 200 m in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2007, vertical profiles of \n\ntemperature, salinity, chlorophyll a concentration and light intensity were measured \n\nwith a Seabird SBE 9 plus CTD fitted with a Seapoint fluorometer and a Chelsea \n\nInstruments PAR sensor, which was deployed at each location immediately after \n\ncollection of the plankton samples. Technical problems prevented the measurement \n\nof hydrological parameters in 2006. During both oceanographic cruises, the organisms \n\nsampled were fixed immediately in 4% buffered formaldehyde and brought to the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n115 \n\nlaboratory for taxonomic identification (Ingle 1983a). The larval series of M. couchi \n\ncomprises 4 zoeae and 1 megalopae (Ingle 1983a). Since the number of megalopae \n\nwas very low (only 1 larva caught in both years combined) this larval stage was not \n\nconsidered in the analysis. Abundances are reported as number of larvae per 100 m\n-3\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1: Map showing Europe and Portugal (a) and the locations of sampling sites in 2006 (b) and \n2007 (c).  b) Sampling started on January 29\n\nth\n, 2006 at 12:00 and ended February 1\n\nst\n, 2006 at 16:30.  c) \n\nSampling started at station 1 on January 24\nth\n\n, 2007 at 15:00 and ended January 31\nst\n\n, 2007 at 11:15. \nFor both years, squares and circles represent sampling with LHPR and Bongo, respectively. Black and \nwhite indicate night and day sampling, respectively, while half colored represent two independent \nsampling taken during the day and at night. \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Vertical distribution  \n\nIn order to examine diel variation in catch of M. couchi abundance were pooled into \n\n50 m intervals from the surface to 300 m or 200 m for 2006 and 2007, respectively. \n\nDue to the very low abundances of larvae caught in 2007 when compared to 2006, \n\nstatistical tests were performed for each year separately. Zoea IV abundances were \n\nexcluded from the analysis in 2007 because only one larva was caught that year. \n\nAbundances were classified according to time of the day (2 levels, day and night), \n\nlarval stage (4 and 3 levels for 2006 and 2007, respectively) and depth (6 and 4 levels \n\nfor 2006 and 2007, respectively) and differences were assessed using a 3-way \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n116 \n\northogonal PERMANOVA. All statistical tests were performed with Primer 6.1 with \n\nPERMANOVA add-on (Primer-E Ltd, Plymouth, UK). All PERMANOVAs used a type III \n\nsum of squares, 9999 permutations and permutation of residuals under a reduced \n\nmodel. Data were transformed [log(a+0.5)] before computation of the resemblance \n\nmatrix using Euclidian distances. Whenever results were significant (P<0.05) a post-\n\nhoc comparison test was used. In order to further describe differences in depth \n\ndistribution with respect to ontogenetic development, the mean depth of each stage \n\nwas computed for each year using a weighted average accounting for differential \n\nlarval abundances at each depth. \n\n5.3.3 Correlation between larval stage and environmental parameters \n\nTo assess if there was a relationship among the distribution and abundance of larval \n\nstages in each year, we performed correlation analyses among abundances of the \n\ndifferent stages. For these analyses, sampling sites with neither larval stage (double \n\nzeros) were excluded.  Because multiple comparisons were performed, the \n\nsignificance levels were adjusted using a sequential Bonferroni correction. \n\nAdditionally, the correlation between larval abundance and environmental \n\nparameters (temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration) was assessed for \n\n2007. Due to the non-normality of the data, a non-parametric Spearman correlation \n\ntest was performed in all cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n117 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2: Monodaeus couchi. Contour plot of concentration (ind. 100 m\n3\n) for zoea I (a), zoea 2 (b), \n\nzoea III (c) and zoea IV (d) encountered off the Algarve coast in 2006. The black shape represents sea -\nbottom, the black dots sampling location. \u201c*\u201d and \u201c#\u201d represent samples where zoeae II, III and IV, \nand zoeae I and II, were simultaneously present. In each quadrant, the four sections represent \ntransect along the longitude 7.43W, 7.53W, 7.63W and 7.73W from top to bottom, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n118 \n\n5.4 Results \n\n5.4.1 Vertical distribution \n\nOverall the abundance of M. couchi was much higher in 2006 than in 2007. In \n\naddition, patches of larvae composed of different development stages were observed \n\nin 2006 (Fig. 2 marked * and #). As expected, larvae abundance decreased as stage \n\nincreased. In 2006, a significant interaction among larval stage, phase of day and \n\ndepth was detected (Pseudo F= 2.16, df= 15, p<0.005; Figure 3). The abundance of \n\nzoea I during the day decreased with increasing depth, with higher catches at 0-50m \n\nand at 50-100 m (post-hoc tests, p<0.048 in all comparisons). At these depths, \n\nabundances were higher during the day than at night (post-hoc tests, p<0.004 in all \n\ncomparisons). By contrast, zoea I abundance at night tended to increase with depth, \n\nbut the differences were not statistically significant. In zoea II, abundances displayed a \n\nsimilar patterns as zoea I,  but the differences between day and night catches were \n\nsignificant only at 0-50m depth interval (post-hoc test, p<0.028). Finally, zoea III and IV \n\nabundances also appeared to be higher during the day at the surface while at night \n\nabundances were higher below 100m. These results were however not significant, \n\nprobably due to the very low numbers of zoea III and IV (overall abundances \u00b1 SE of \n\n0.0638 \u00b1 0.0600 ind.?100m\n-3\n\n, 0.0029 \u00b1 0.00006 ind.?100m\n-3\n\n,\n  \n\n0.0019 \u00b1 0.00009 \n\nind.?100m\n-3 \n\nand 0.0012 \u00b1 0.00007 ind.?100m\n-3 \n\nfor zoeae I, II, III and IV, respectively). In \n\n2007, abundances were significantly higher during the day than at night for all stages \n\nand depths (Pseudo F= 3.91, df= 1, p<0.03; Figure 4). Those results must however be \n\ninterpreted with caution since larval abundances were extremely low (overall \n\nabundances of 0.0327 \u00b1 0.0151 ind.?100m\n-3\n\n, 0.0009 \u00b1 0.00002 ind.?100m\n-3\n\n,\n \n0.0003 \u00b1 \n\n0.00001 ind.?100m\n-3 \n\nand 0.0034 \u00b1 0.0010 ind.?100m\n-3 \n\nfor zoeae I, II, III and IV, \n\nrespectively) and most larvae of the later stages (93% abundance of ZIII and IV) were \n\nencountered during the day at a single sampling site. \n\nFinally, mean depth of larvae varied between years but overall the first stage was \n\nencountered at lower depth than later stages, with zoea IV average depth being the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n119 \n\ndeepest (average average depth of distribution for both years combined were 85.7, \n\n119.6, 109.7 and 129.5 m for zoeae I to IV).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3: Monodaeus couchi. Abundance of larvae (ind. 100 m\n3\n\u00b1 standard error) with respect to \n\ndepth for a) zoea I, b) zoea II, c) zoea III, and d) zoea IV as a function of the phase of the day for the \n2006 cruise. White and black bars represend day and night samples, respectively. Identical letters \nabove bars represent statistically similar abundances acording to post-hoc tests. The scale of \nabundance is different between zoea I and zoea II, III and IV.  \n\n \n\n5.4.2 Correlations among larval stages, and between larval stages and \n\nenvironmental parameters \n\nSpearman correlation (rs) values between the concentrations of the different zoeal \n\nstages indicated that the abundance of zoeae I and II (rs=0.37), zoeae I and IV (rs= \n\n0.30), and zoeae II and IV (rs= 0.45) were correlated in 2006. In 2007 only the \n\nconcentrations of zoeae I and II were correlated (rs= 0.75; all values significant at \n\n???????probability level after Bonferroni correction, in 2006 and 2007). The difference \n\nin the results between years might be explained by the scarcity of zoeae III and IV. \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n120 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4: Monodaeus couchi.

Identical letters above bars \nrepresent statistically similar abundances acording to post-hoc tests. The scale of abundance is \ndifferent between zoea I and zoea II, III and IV. \n\n \n\nIn 2007 chlorophyll a levels had subsurface maxima between 30 and 70 m, decreased \n\nrapidly to about 180 m to become constant below that depth (Fig. 5). Temperature \n\nalso decreased with depth and there was a sharp drop in temperature between 120 \n\nand 130 m indicative of a thermocline. The same pattern was observed for salinity, \n\nwith a halocline located at the same depth range. Spearman correlations between \n\nenvironmental factors and the concentrations of larvae indicated that zoea I \n\nconcentrations were positively correlated with chlorophyll a (rs= 0.27), salinity (rs=0.23) \n\nand temperature (rs= 0.24; all values significant at ???????probability level after \n\nBonferroni correction). In contrast, concentrations of zoea II were only positively \n\ncorrelated with levels of chlorophyll a (rs= 0,24). Zoeae III and IV were not correlated \n\nwith any measured parameter. Catches of zoea I and II were maximal when \n\nchlorophyll a was above 0.3 mg m\n-3\n\n (Fig. 5). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n121 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5: Monodaeus couchi. Standardized catch of zoea plotted as a function of depth (m) and \nchlorophyll a concentration (mg m\n\n-3\n) during the 2007 campaing off the coast of Algarve. The  lines \n\nrepresents the average profile of chlorophyll a, temperature (\u00baC) and salinity concentration \ncalculated from measurements made at all the stations.  \n\n \n\n5.5 Discussion \n\nIn this study, the coast off southern Portugal was sampled for two consecutive years. \n\nOverall, larval abundance of Monodaeus couchi in 2006 was higher than in 2007, all \n\nlarval stages were found at depths above 300 m with the early stages concentrated in \n\nchlorophyll-rich layers, and the differences in abundance according to phase of day \n\nand depth indicate the occurrence of reverse diel vertical migration.  \n\nThe occurrence of Monodaeus couchi larvae in the surface layer indicates that larvae \n\nhatching from benthic females from the slope and mud volcanoes populations are \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n122 \n\nable to rapidly ascend to the surface, crossing the thermocline around 120 m, to feed \n\nin surface waters, as shown by the positive correlation between first stages and \n\nchlorophyll a. This migration to the surface is widespread among first stage crab zoeae \n\nand results from negative geotaxis and high barokinesis (Ott and Forward 1976; \n\nSchembri 1982; Sulkin 1973). Crab larvae are able to cross sharp picnoclynes during \n\nmigration towards surface waters, and this has also been demonstrated in early zoeal \n\nstages of Geryon quinquedens (Kelly et al. 1982), another deep-water brachyuran. \n\nAverage larval depth increased with larval stage, also in line with numerous reports \n\nshowing a preponderance of positive geotaxis in older larvae (Sulkin 1973), especially \n\nat the transition to the megalopa stage that must settle to appropriate benthic \n\nhabitats. In the case of M. couchi, megalopae will have to settle several hundred \n\nmeters deeper on the seabed, which, together with the attrition of densities with age, \n\nwould explain the absence of megalopae in our samples. \n\nIn zooplankton, diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviors vary interspecifically (Han and \n\nStraskraba 2001). Species can undergo any of the three described types of migration \n\nor not migrate at all (Forward 1988): 1) nocturnal diel migration, the most common \n\nform where larvae rise to surface water during the night to feed and sink below the \n\nphotic zone during the day, 2) reverse diel vertical migration where larvae rise to the \n\nsurface during the day and sink to deeper water at night and 3) twilight migration \n\nwhere larvae undergo two upward migrations near sunset and sunrise. Even \n\nintraspecifically, DVM behavior might vary with time, location  (e.g. distance from \n\ncoast) or environmental conditions such as fluctuations in predator or prey \n\nabundances or vertical stratification (Irigoien et al. 2004; Osgood and Frost 2004). In \n\nthe present study, M. couchi was most abundant during the day in the top hundred \n\nmeter of the water column, while at night abundance increased with depth. In the \n\nAlgarve area M. couchi thus underwent reverse diel vertical migration which was most \n\ndefined in the 2006 sampling period, probably due to the overall higher larval \n\nabundances observed.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n123 \n\nIn several studies, reverse DVM has been suggested as a defense against predators \n\nthat also migrate vertically. As observed in various copepod species, when predators \n\nexhibit nocturnal DVM, their prey may undergo reverse DVM (Irigoien et al. 2004; \n\nOsgood and Frost 2004). This behavior has been associated with areas where the \n\npredators rely more on tactile stimuli than sight to capture prey, as is  the case for \n\nmany invertebrate predators (e. g. chaetognaths and gelatinous zooplankton) which \n\nthemselves are undergoing regular DVM as a way to escape fish predators (Tester et \n\nal. 2004).  Reverse DVM has also been observed in areas with lower abundances of \n\npredatory fish (Lagergren et al. 2008). Since shifts in composition and abundance of \n\npredator populations occur, the prey must be able to adjust their behavior accordingly \n\nand, therefore, temporal and geographical plasticity in DVM behavior of M. couchi \n\nlarvae could exist in response to changing environmental conditions.  \n\nThe abundance of zoea I and II was found to be positively correlated with chlorophyll \n\na levels. There are two mechanisms which might explain the correlation between the \n\ntwo factors. First, M. couchi larvae, their prey and phytoplankton might be passively \n\naggregated together due to hydrodynamic processes.  Second,  larvae responding to \n\nphysical or biological factors might actively swim to avoid unsuitable environments \n\n(Folt and Burns 1999). In contrast, zoeae III and IV abundances were not correlated \n\nwith chlorophyll a, which is explained by the highly variable depth distribution as well \n\nas very low abundances of these stages. Those larger larvae might shift their diet to \n\ndifferent, larger prey items that might be distributed more evenly in the water column \n\nresulting in the observed pattern.  \n\nOur results indicate that newly hatched larvae of Monodaeus couchi, and probably of \n\nother open ocean benthic decapods, can migrate hundreds, if not thousands, of \n\nmeters to the photic layers of the water column where food is more abundant. Late-\n\nstage larvae were encountered deeper, initiating the return migration to the sea bed. \n\nFollowing the first ontogenetic migration to surface layers, diel vertical migration \n\nbehavior of such species is relatively unknown. M. couchi was found to perform a \n\n\n\nVertical distribution of M.couchi larvae \n\n124 \n\nreverse migration within the top 300 m of the ocean, but variability might exist in \n\nDVM behavior depending on the species, location and environmental conditions.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors thank Dr. Dave Conway and the crew of the RV \u201cNoruega\u201d for their \n\nindispensable support during the survey, F\u00e1tima Quintela for her help during sampling \n\nprocessing and Dr. Craig Young for his useful review of the manuscript.

Because of their reduced swimming ability, circulation pattern is the \n\nprimary factor influencing dispersal. Knowing larval distribution and abundance is \n\nnecessary to predict location and size of the breeding population. In this study, spatial \n\ndistribution and abundance of the decapod larvae were assessed. Two week-long \n\ncampaigns were conducted at the end of January in 2006 and 2007, respectively \n\nsampling 28 and 47 sites in three different regions off the South Coast of Portugal; the \n\ncoast of Algarve, Sagres and Alentejo. Larvae were collected by oblique plankton hauls \n\nfrom the surface to 200-300 m. In addition to in situ measurements of environmental \n\nparameters, an oceanographic model was used to better understand the processes \n\naffecting larval dispersal. Both years, Monodaeus couchi was the most abundant \n\nspecies, followed by Goneplax rhomboides. However, coastal species such as \n\nAtelecyclus rotundatus, Pilumnus sp., Processa spp. and Philocheras spp. that \n\ndominate in the 2006 campaign, were almost completely absent in the 2007, more \n\noffshore, campaign. Offshore decapod composition off the Algarve coast was similar \n\nbetween years even though overall decapod catch in 2007 was much lower than in \n\n2006. Larval distribution and abundance varied between sampling area which is likely \n\nto be the result of differences in hydrographic conditions and adult distribution. \n\nIndeed, an upwelling event was occurring off the southwest coast of Portugal at the \n\ntime of sampling, which separated the Northeastern part of Alentejo from the \n\nSouthwestern part which had lower decapod abundances and diversity than it \n\nNortheastern counterpart. Additionally, the Northeastern part of the Alentejo area \n\nwas dominated by the crabs Cancer spp., Carcinus maenas and Atelecyclus rotundatus \n\nwhich were completely absent from the Southwest. In the NE, the most abundant \n\nspecies were retained onshore while offshore transport occurred in zooplankton and \n\nto a lesser extent in some shelf species.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n133 \n\n6.2 Introduction \n\nLarval dispersal and supply are recognized as fundamental mechanisms regulating the \n\ndynamics of marine populations (Caley and Carr 1996; Kritzer and Sale 2006) and \n\ntherefore they are key to the management of fisheries resources, the understanding \n\nof the spread of invasive species, the design of marine protected areas and the \n\nassessment of climate-change effects (Levin 2006; Paulay and Meyer 2006). In benthic \n\ndecapod crustaceans the larval phase is a critical stage as it often represents the \n\nprincipal agent of connectivity among local populations and the only period available \n\nfor dispersal. Decapod larvae generally lack strong horizontal swimming abilities but \n\nare capable of regulating their position in the water column through vertical \n\nswimming. A large body of evidence (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005) shows \n\nthat decapod larvae respond to environmental and internal stimuli to trigger or inhibit \n\nvertical swimming. Changes in depth distribution related to those cues will influence \n\ndirectly or indirectly growth, feeding, and mortality, settlement to benthic habitats \n\nand, ultimately, dispersal and transport. \n\nDuring the period from hatching to settlement, mortality is high and only larvae that \n\nremain in suitable environments will be able to thrive. General circulation pattern is \n\nthe main primary factor influencing larval transport on a large spatial scale (>1000 \n\nkm). Eddies, estuarine plumes or even upwelling event, affect larval distribution on \n\nsmaller scales (e.g. Queiroga et al. 2007). Finally, on a short scale (<100 m) larvae can \n\nregulate their position and respond to changes in the water properties such as light, \n\ntemperature, salinity, hydrostatic pressure (Epifanio and Garvine 2001; Folt and Burns \n\n1999; Forward 1988), and biotic factors (e.g. phytoplankton abundance, predator and \n\nprey concentration), thus actively influencing their horizontal or vertical position. \n\nConcerning biotic factors, state of feeding influence vertical distribution and predation \n\nis one of the largest cause of mortality (McConaugha 1992). Presence of appropriate \n\nfood items, not only in terms of size, catchability and energetic value, but also of good \n\nbiochemical composition, will further promote or hinder successful development \n\n(Fuchs and Franks 2010). Additionally, variations in physical factors such as \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n134 \n\ntemperature and salinity will affect duration of the larval phase which could impact \n\nsurvival and successful settlement (Anger 2001).  \n\nBecause of the high diversity of habitats colonized by decapods, larval developmental \n\nstrategies vary greatly. Benthic species inhabiting coastal and estuarine areas as \n\nadults, but which develop in the open ocean during the larval phase, possess \n\nmechanisms that allow them to concentrate inshore before settlement to appropriate \n\nadult habitat takes place (dos Santos et al. 2007; Morgan et al. 2009; Queiroga and \n\nBlanton 2005). In contrast, adults of offshore decapods can be either pelagic (e.g. \n\nSergestids shrimps), benthopelagic (many Caridean shrimps) or benthic (many \n\nbrachyuran and anomuran crabs, as well as lobsters). Post-larvae of offshore benthic \n\ndecapods will often require settling in substrate suitable for juvenile and adult \n\ndevelopment and survival. In contrast, since in pelagic species the larval stage is not \n\nthe only stage available for dispersal, it can be assumed that metamorphosis is \n\nindependent of substrate conditions, being controlled only by physical factors and \n\nphysiological state.  \n\nIn either case, circulation patterns will have a large impact on larval dispersal. Large \n\nscale circulation pattern generally have a marked seasonal pattern; however \n\nvariations can be observed over the period of day to weeks. A good understanding of \n\nthe hydrography of the sampling area is therefore critical to better understand larval \n\ndistribution. Off the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, our area of study, ocean \n\ncirculation has a marked seasonal pattern, related to atmospheric forcing and \n\nsubjected to the influence of the large scale circulation (Azores Current Branch; \n\nreviewed by Peliz et al. 2005; Relvas et al. 2007). During summer, circulation along the \n\nSouth-West coast of Portugal (Alentejo coast, see Fig. 1) is characterized by upwelling \n\nand its associated southward flow that brings up colder water near the coast and \n\ntransports surface waters offshore. Poleward flow is typically observed during winter, \n\nalthough upwelling events are frequently reported during this season (Relvas et al. \n\n2007). The waters that feed this poleward flow during winter have hydrographic \n\ncharacteristics (salty and warm) similar to those found in the Northern branches of the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n135 \n\nAzores current. Southerly winds along the West coast further reinforce the poleward \n\nflow thus promoting coastward transport (Frouin et al. 1990). \n\nSurface circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz is cyclonic, with westward circulation in the \n\nAlgarve region (Fig. 1) along the deeper slope (600 m to 1300 m depth) related to the \n\nMediterranean Underflow (MU). The presence of a flow in the eastward direction \n\n(called Gulf of Cadiz Slope Current), centered above isobaths 200m and feeding the \n\nMediterranean basin with Atlantic surface waters through the strait of Gibraltar (Fig. \n\n1), is also observed along the upper slope of the Algarve coast.  The mean circulation \n\nof the Gulf of Cadiz is studied in detail in Peliz et al. (2007). \n\nDespite the high number of studies investigating decapod larvae abundances in \n\ncoastal areas (DiBacco et al. 2001; Queiroga et al. 2006; Storm and Pedersen 2003), \n\nsuch studies remain scarce in offshore areas and, more specifically, very little is known \n\nabout decapod larvae abundances in offshore waters of the Iberian Peninsula (dos \n\nSantos and Peliz 2005)since most studies have focused on coastal areas, i.e. areas over \n\nthe continental shelf with a bottom depth lower than 200 m (deCastro et al. 2003; dos \n\nSantos et al. 2008; Gonzalez-Gordillo and Rodriguez 2003; Paula 1987; Queiroga \n\n1996).  \n\nThe main objective of the present study was to obtain data on the composition, \n\nabundance and distribution of decapod crustacean larvae off the south Portuguese \n\ncoast during winter of the years 2006 and 2007. Attention was focused on annual and \n\nregional differences and onshore-offshore contrasts. Due to the occurrence of an \n\nupwelling event off the SW coast of Portugal during the 2007 sampling period, we \n\nused an oceanographic numerical model to explain the formation of the upwelling \n\nfront and provide an interpretation of the physical transport mechanisms that \n\nunderlie larval distribution and drift in this area. The outputs of the model helped \n\nelucidate the mechanism generating the segregation of the assemblages in the \n\nAlentejo region in 2007 found on either side of the front. Stronger knowledge of \n\nvariations in larval dispersal and the processes causing them will ultimately help us \n\nunderstand better how global changes might impact the lifecycle of decapod species. \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n136 \n\n6.3 Material and Methods \n\n6.3.1 Field collection \n\nIn order to investigate the distribution of Decapod larvae, two oceanographic cruises \n\nwere conducted off the south coast of Portugal, one from January 29\nth\n\n to February 5\nth\n\n \n\nof 2006 and the other from January 24\nth\n\n to 31\nst \n\nof 2007.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1: . Sampling area: Map showing the Iberian Peninsula (a) and the locations of sampling sites \nin 2006 (b) and 2007 (c). In 2006 (b) sampling started on January 29th at 12:00 and ended on February \n1st at 16:30. In 2007 (c) sampling started at station 1 on January 24th at 15:00 and ended January \n31st at 11:15. For both years, circles and squares represent sampling with LHPR and Bongo, \nrespectively. Black and white indicate night and day sampling, respectively, while half colored \nrepresent two independent sampling taken during the day and at night. The Alentejo area was \ndivided, as indicated by the black line, into a northeast and a southwest subregions based on \noceanographic and modelling results. Arrows indicate the major rivers named in italic. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n137 \n\nIn 2006, a total of 25 locations were sampled off the south coast of Algarve, between \n\nCape St. Maria and the Spanish border (Fig. 1b). All locations in this region were \n\nsampled by oblique hauls using a Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) equipped \n\nwith a 42 cm diameter cone, 280 ?m mesh net and a flow meter to sample 21 \n\nlocations (9 day, 12 night). The water column was resolved into approximately 25 m \n\ndepth strata, from the surface to 10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of \n\n300 m at the deeper locations.  Due to technical problems with the LHPR, 4 additional \n\nlocations (2 day, 2 night) were sampled with a Bongo net equipped with a 335 ?m \n\nmesh net and a flow meter from the surface to 200 m. Technical problems precluded \n\nthe collection of hydrographic measurements during the 2006 cruise. \n\nSamples in 2007 were taken in 3 different regions (Fig. 1c). Again, due to technical \n\nproblems, the sampling was partially made with a Bongo net in replacement of the \n\nLHPR. A total of 17 locations were sampled off the south coast of Algarve between \n\nCape of St. Maria and the Spanish border, between January 24\nth\n\n and 27\nth\n\n. From these, \n\n9 locations were sampled twice, at approximately 24 h intervals. The remaining 8 \n\nwere only sampled once. Overall, 14 samples were taken during the day and 10 at \n\nnight. In this area, all locations were sampled with LHPR from the surface to 200 m. \n\nSampling in this region differed from that conducted in 2006 because all locations \n\nsampled were off the shelf (bottom depth >200m). In the second area, located off \n\nCape of Sagres at the western tip of the Algarve coast, 9 locations were sampled \n\ntwice, with 6 samples collected during the day and 12 at night, between January 27\nth\n\n \n\nand 29\nth\n\n. The 5 most coastal locations were on the continental shelf and will hereafter \n\nbe referred to as \u201ccoastal\u201d (bottom depth &lt;200m). Finally 22 locations were sampled \n\noff the coast of Alentejo, 9 during the day and 13 at night, between January 29\nth\n\n and \n\n31\nst\n\n. From those sampling sites, 4 were located on the continental shelf. Again due to \n\ntechnical problems affecting the LHPR, the Sagres and the Alentejo regions, (except \n\nfor one location off of Sagres) were sampled with the Bongo net from the surface to \n\n10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of 200 m. Overall, 29 samples were \n\ntaken during the day and 35 during the night. For both oceanographic cruises, the \n\norganisms sampled were immediately fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and brought \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n138 \n\nto the laboratory for taxonomic identification. Decapod larvae were identified to the \n\nlowest taxonomic level possible and staged, according to dos Santos and Gonzalez-\n\nGordillo (2004) and dos Santos and Lindley (2001). Additionally, the zooplankton \n\nbiovolume at each station was measured and used as a proxy for zooplankton \n\nbiomass.  \n\nIn 2007, measurements of vertical distribution of temperature and salinity were made \n\nwith a Seabird SBE 9 plus CTD, which was deployed at each location immediately after \n\ncollection of the plankton samples. Concerning atmospheric forcing, the wind field for \n\nthe Alentejo region was extracted from QuikSCAT for the month of January 2007 \n\n(average between 9.5-9.0W and 37.25-37.75N). Data were extracted from CERSAT \n\nreanalysis data (IFREMER, France; cersat.ifremer.fr). \n\n6.3.2 Statistical analysis \n\nBongo and LHPR nets have different efficiencies. Stehle et al (2007) demonstrated \n\nthat estimates of concentrations produced from depth-integrated oblique hauls by \n\nthe LHPR were up to 7 times higher, depending on taxa, than those obtained by the \n\nBongo net. This effect seems to be related to escape from the slow-towed Bongo net. \n\nTherefore, in order to compare the abundance of Decapod larvae caught with the \n\nLHPR and the Bongo nets, the catch values of the latter were divided by a ratio \n\nestimator of 0.45, as was obtained for Decapod zoeae from both day and night \n\nsamples of the coast of Portugal. This conversion factor was found to produce a \n\nmaximum error of 37% within a 95% confidence level. Similarly, zooplankton \n\nbiovolumes were adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.12, as obtained for total \n\nbiomass. This conversion factor was found to produce a maximum error of 4% within a \n\n95% confidence level (Stehle et al. 2007).  This is a sub-optimal design because the \n\ncorrection factor may not account for taxa-specific differences in efficiency between \n\nthe two nets. However, on average the actual error will be much less than 37% and, as \n\nthe most abundant taxa have similar sizes, we might expect small differences in net \n\nefficiencies across taxa. Additionally, most of the decapod species sampled in the \n\nstudy by Stehle et al. (2007) were the same as collected in the present study. We \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n139 \n\ntherefore believe that the use of this correcting factor to compare results obtained by \n\nthe two nets is justified. In all samples, the number of individuals caught was \n\nexpressed in number of larvae per 100 m\n3\n. \n\nIn order to test for differences in decapod larvae species composition and abundance \n\nbetween years and sampling locations, three distinct analyses were performed with \n\nPRIMER (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research) 6.1 software \n\nequipped with PERMANOVA + 1.0. First, the differences between coastal and offshore \n\nlocation were evaluated for the 2006 samples in the Algarve. The separation between \n\nthe coastal and offshore region was made following the 200 m isobath. Then, \n\ngeographical differences were assessed using the 2007 data. In the case of the \n\nAlentejo sampling, between January 29\nth\n\n and 31\nst\n\n 2007, direct inspection of \n\nhydrographic fields (salinity and temperature), indicated that two different water \n\nmasses were present, separated by a front, visible in the salinity and temperature \n\ndistribution (Fig. 4), and also inferred from the corresponding modeled fields \n\ndescribed below (Fig. 6). As a result, this region was divided into two sub-regions, \n\nNortheast and Southwest that were separated by the front, and sampling sites were \n\ntherefore classified into four groups in 2007, Algarve, Sagres, Alentejo Southwest and \n\nAlentejo Northeast (Fig. 1). Finally, inter-annual differences were assessed between \n\nthe 2006 offshore sampling sites and the Algarve region of 2007. Additionally, the \n\neffect of the day/night cycle on decapod abundance was factored in each analysis. In \n\nall cases, data were square root transformed prior to analysis and a resemblance \n\nmatrix was created using Bray-Curtis similarities. Significant differences were tested \n\nusing PERMANOVA. In order to visualize similarities and dissimilarities of the data, a \n\nPrincipal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) was performed. The contribution of the main two \n\naxes was plotted and a vector overlay was added to indicate the strength of the \n\nrelationship between each species and the PCO axes using Pearson correlation. Only \n\nspecies with a vector length greater than 0.5 were plotted. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n140 \n\n6.3.3 Oceanographic model \n\nInspection of the temperature and salinity fields obtained in the 2007 cruise indicated \n\nthe occurrence of a pronounced frontal structure off the Alentejo coast (see Results). \n\nIn order to elucidate the process originating the frontal structure, which takes place \n\nover an area much larger that the region sampled, as well as its influence on the \n\nobserved larval distribution during the 2007 cruise, numerical model simulations of \n\nthe ocean circulation were conducted using the primitive equation hydrostatic \n\nRegional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS; Shchepetkin and McWilliams 2003). The \n\npresent configuration, represents an improvement and extension of those used by \n\nPeliz et al. (2007) and Oliveira et al (2009). In the scope of the present work, a \n\nsummarized description is given for the present configuration. For full details about \n\nthe model configuration the reader is referred to the above works. The main domain \n\nof the model includes the Western Iberian margin, from the Gulf of Cadiz (34.5 \u00baN) to \n\nthe Bay of Biscay 45.5 \u00baN, and from 12.5 \u00baW to the Strait of Gibraltar 5.5 \u00baW. \n\nBoundary conditions were taken from a larger domain in such a way that it allowed \n\nsolving the influence of the large-scale circulation (Azores current) on the main \n\ndomain, as well as the influence of the Mediterranean outflow through Strait of \n\nGibraltar. The model was run for the period 2001-2008 and was forced by the NCEP2 \n\nair-sea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov), QuikScat reanalyzed satellite winds extracted \n\nfrom CERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr) and river input. \n\n \n\n6.4 Results \n\n6.4.1 Decapod larval composition and abundance in 2006 and 2007 \n\nThe list of decapod species or genera for which larvae were collected is given in Table \n\n1. From the 49 taxa sampled, 30 were encountered in both years, 7 in 2006 only and \n\n12 in 2007 only. Most taxa were present at low densities (<0.05 ind 100m\n-3\n\n). Overall, \n\nlarval  abundance was much  higher  in  2006  than  in  2007  (Fig. 2a).  Abundance was \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2: Decapod abundances: Vertically integrated concentrations of decapod larvae in locations \nsampled in 2006 and 2007, for (a) all Decapoda, (b) Brachyura, (c) Dendrobranchiata, (d) Anomura, (e) \nCaridea larvae and (f) zooplankton biovolumes. In a) to e) the size of the circle represents larval \nconcentration according to the scale shown in each panel (ind 100 m\n\n-3\n).

In 2007 high larval abundance was also encountered off the \n\ncoast of Alentejo in the coastal side of the front (Fig. 1). In both years, brachyuran \n\ncrabs were the most common group, representing 70% and 77% of total Decapoda \n\nabundance for 2006 and 2007, respectively. They were mainly Monodaeus couchi, \n\nGoneplax rhomboides, Pilumnus spp., Atelecyclus rotundatus and Liocarcinus spp. \n\nConsequently, brachyuran larvae were also highly abundant in 2006 close to the \n\nGuadiana and Mira rivers (Fig. 2b). The second most abundant group was the \n\ndendrobranchiata shrimps (13% and 18% total abundance, respectively) in which the \n\nmost common species were Solenocera membranacea and Sergestes spp.. Their \n\nabundance was very low close to the coast and predominated in the Algarve as \n\nopposed to the Sagres and Alentejo regions (Fig. 2c). Hermit crabs represented 9% \n\nand 3% of total abundance in 2006 and 2007 respectively (Fig. 2d). The most common \n\nwere Anapagurus spp. and Pagurus spp. (both years) and the squat lobster Munida \n\nspp. (in 2007). Finally, caridean shrimps made up 8% and 2% of total abundance in \n\n2006 and 2007 respectively (Fig. 2e), with Alpheus glaber, Processa spp. and \n\nPhilocheras spp. being very abundant in 2006. In comparison, caridean shrimps \n\nabundance was very low in 2007. Their abundance was high only in the Northeast of \n\nthe Algarve sampling area, which is influenced by the river Guadiana. Numbers were \n\nvery low in the offshore sampling sites. The other groups (Gebiidea, Astacidea and \n\nAchelata) represented together less than 1% of the larvae collected in both years.

A total of 9 taxa were \n\nfound only over the shelf, 6 only offshore, and 20 both on the shelf and offshore \n\n(Table 1). Results of the PERMANOVA indicated that distribution and abundance \n\nvaried between the coastal and offshore sampling sites in 2006 (p<0.0001) but there \n\nwas no statistically significant difference in larval distribution between day and night \n\nsamples (p>0.064). Coastal sites were dominated by larvae of the crabs Goneplax \n\nrhomboides, Pilumnus spp., Atelecyclus rotundatus, and Liocarcinus spp. and of the \n\ncaridean shrimps Plesionika, spp., and Philocheras spp. In contrast, the most common \n\nspecies encountered offshore were Monodaeus couchi and Sergestes spp. (Fig. 3).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3: Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) comparing coastal vs. offshore decapod distribution in \n2006.

Only vectors with a Pearson correlation greater than 0.5 are \nshown. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n145 \n\n6.4.3 Regional patterns of decapod larval distribution in 2007 \n\nThroughout the sampling area temperature and salinity were vertically homogeneous \n\nfrom the surface to about 130 m, where the start of a thermocline was found. \n\nTherefore, a reference depth of 50 m was chosen as representative of the \n\ntemperature and salinity fields between the surface and 130 m (Fig. 4). The Algarve \n\nregion, located in the Gulf of Cadiz, showed higher temperature (Fig. 4a) and salinity \n\n(Fig. 4b) values than the other zones in this surface layer. The Sagres region and the \n\nsouthwest part of the Alentejo region had similar temperature (Fig. 4a) and salinity \n\n(Fig. 4b) values. Colder and fresher waters were found in the northeast part of the \n\nAlentejo region (Fig. 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4: Physical data: (a) Temperature (\u00baC), (b) salinity, pattern at 50 m depth in the three areas \nof sampling off the south coast of Portugal during the 2007 cruise. \n\nThe temperature and salinity fields off Alentejo indicated the presence of two \n\ndifferent water masses separated by a well defined frontal region aligned in the NW-\n\nSE direction (Fig. 4). The presence of this front in the surface layer can also be \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n146 \n\nrecognized in satellite images extracted for the region (not shown) and by the \n\nclustering of the vertical profiles in two groups on the basis of the location of the \n\nsampling stations relative to the front above 150 m (Fig. 5), despite of a less clear \n\nsegregation of profiles from stations within, and adjacent to, the front. A further \n\ndistinction of the vertical profiles is that they showed a more clearly defined and \n\nstronger thermocline in the SW side of the front than in the NE (Fig. 5).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5: Physical data: Vertical profiles for in situ measurement (top) and model predictions \n(bottom) for temperature (\u00baC), and salinity fields in the Alentejo sampling area during the 2007 \ncruise. \n\nNortherly upwelling favorable winds were predominant during most of January 2007, \n\nreaching higher intensity during the period of 21th to 27th of January, preceding the \n\nsampling in the Alentejo coast that took place between January 29\nth\n\n and 31\nst\n\n (Fig. 6b). \n\nTherefore, the front separating the offshore warmer and saltier waters from the \n\ncolder and fresher waters closer to the coast can be interpreted as resulting from this \n\nupwelling event. This interpretation is supported by the model results, which \n\nreproduce many of the observed hydrological features. The vertical profiles generated \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n147 \n\nby the model for each station also show a segregation of the water masses at the \n\nsurface and a decrease in salinity and temperature closer to the coast caused by the \n\nupwelled water (Fig. 5), as well as a frontal structure clearly developed by the 28\nth\n\n of \n\nJanuary (Fig. 6a), although the predicted salinity values at the surface are lower than \n\nthe ones recorded. The model also predicts some recirculation in the area with a \n\nnorthward flow offshore and a southward flow of coastal region (Fig. 6a, blue color in \n\nthe temperature, salinity and velocity fields). This upwelling event may also be the \n\ncause for the clear difference observed in the zooplankton distribution between the \n\ntwo sides of the front, with much lower abundances observed inshore of the front \n\n(Fig. 2f). \n\nThe presence of this front and of the different water masses motivated the separation \n\nof the Alentejo region into two sub-regions, the Northeast Alentejo and the Southwest \n\nAlentejo, when analyzing the regional patterns of larval abundance in 2007. In this \n\nyear peak abundance occurred off the coast of Alentejo and in the Algarve region. The \n\nspecies present also differed between the zones. A total of 24 taxa were identified in \n\nthe Algarve, 27 in Sagres, 22 in the Southwest Alentejo and 30 in the Northeast \n\nAlentejo (Table 1). Abundance and diversity of Dendrobranchiata were highest in the \n\nAlgarve region but very low in all sampling sites of the three other areas, from where \n\nthey were sometimes absent (Fig. 2c).  Results of the PERMANOVA indicated that \n\nthere were no differences in the distribution and abundance in relation of the phase \n\nof the day (p=0.93). Larval composition differed between the regions sampled \n\np=0.0014; Fig. 7). The Sagres and the southwest of Alentejo had similar species \n\nabundance and distribution (p=0.57), grouping together in the PCO plot, but the other \n\nareas were all different from each other (p<0.04 in all pairwise comparisons). The \n\n(differences in species composition resided mainly in the composition of crabs as \n\nMonodaeus couchi and Goneplax rhomboides (Figure 8 and 9) that were most \n\nabundant in the Algarve, whereas Cancer spp., Carcinus maenas and Atelecyclus \n\nrotundatus (Figure 10, 11 and 12) distinguished the Northeast Alentejo from the other \n\nareas (Fig. 7). Moreover, the last three species were absent from the southeast \n\nAlentejo. \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n148 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6: Oceanographic model (top): Temporal evolution of simulated temperature (1\nst\n\n column), \nsalinity (2\n\nnd\n column) and meridional component of the velocity (3\n\nrd\n column) fields from the 14\n\nth\n and \n\n28\nth\n\n of January, 2007.

A total of 18 taxa were encountered both \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n156 \n\nyears, 9 were only found in 2006 and 8 only in 2007. The difference between the two \n\nyears was explained by the high abundances of the crabs, Monodaeus couchi and \n\nGoneplax rhomboides, the Anomuran squat lobster Munida  spp. and the shrimp \n\nSolenocera membranacea in 2006 whereas in 2007 abundances of Sergia robusta was \n\nmuch higher than in 2006. Additionally, Pilumnus spp., which was encountered in high \n\nabundance in 2006, was completely absent the following year (Fig. 14).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.14: Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) comparing offshore decapod distribution between \n2006 and 2007 cruises. Inset map indicates sampling locations. Black and grey triangles represent \n2006 and 2007 sampling site, respectively. Vector length and direction indicate strength and sign of \nthe relationship between the variable and the PCO axes. Only vectors with a Pearson correlation \ngreater than 0.5 are shown. \n\n \n\n6.5 Discussion \n\nDecapod distribution varied between years, distances from the coast and geographical \n\narea. Sampling sites located in coastal areas were dominated by estuarine species \n\n(e.g., Carcinus maenas, Nepinnotheres pinnotheres, Diogenes pugilator). Regardless of \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n157 \n\nareas or year of sampling, the composition and abundance of decapod larvae was \n\nindependent from the phase of the day. Since samples were taken between the \n\nsurface and a maximum of 300 m and integrate the entire water column, it can only \n\nbe deduced that the larvae are remaining between these depths and that, even if \n\nvertical migration takes place, they do not migrate below that point. These results are \n\nnot surprising, as the diel vertical migration performed by most species is \n\nencompassed within this depth range (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005, Table \n\n4) and suggest that the nocturnal vertical migration behavior that is generally depicted \n\nby decapods larvae in the ocean was restricted to this depth level.  \n\nAll taxa identified to species level can be categorized into two groups regarding the \n\ngeographical distribution of adults (d\u2019Udekem d\u2019Acoz 1999; Manning and Holthuis \n\n1981; Zariquiey Alvarez 1968): i) species with known geographical limits located \n\nsomewhere between Norway and Mauritania (e. g. Cancer spp., Nephrops norvegicus, \n\nCrangon crangon, Carcinus maenas and Polybius henslowii; ii) species with known \n\ngeographical limits located somewhere between Norway and South Africa (e. g. \n\nMonodaeus couchii, Diogenes pugilator, Parapenaeus longirostris and Athanas \n\nnitescens). Some of the species in the second group have populations in the tropical \n\nWest African coast, while others reached an anti-tropical distribution presumably by \n\nlatitudinal submergence (Briggs 1974; Hedgepeth 1957).  All these species except C. \n\nmaenas also occur in the Mediterranean. Taxa identified to genus level include \n\nspecies belonging to these two categories as well as tropical species. In neither case \n\nthese genuses include only tropical species. Therefore, the larval assemblage found in \n\nthe south and southwest coasts of Portugal during the two winters sampled can be \n\nconsidered as typical of the Lusitanian Province, Mediterranean-Atlantic Region, with \n\nsome influence from more boreal species (Briggs 1974). \n\nFor both years, the abundance of larvae was relatively low. Two factors may \n\ncontribute to the relative paucity of the larvae. The first is a seasonal effect. Indeed, in \n\na spring campaign over the Portuguese western shelf, larval abundances was one to \n\ntwo orders of magnitude higher that what was recorded in the present study (Table 2, \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n158 \n\ndos Santos et al. 2008). Most species in the area reproduce primarily during the spring \n\nand summer months, and higher overall abundances are expected during this period. \n\nHowever, a previous study by dos Santos (1999) found that larvae of Carcinus maenas, \n\nEbalia spp., and species from the sub-family Polybiinae (e.g. Liocarcinus spp., \n\nMacropipus spp., and Polybius henslowii) were primarily found during the winter, and \n\noccurrence of Gennadas elegans, Nephrops norvegicus and Palinurus elephas larvae \n\nwas limited to winter months.  In this sense, decapod larvae composition in the \n\nwinters of 2006 and 2007 was similar to that observed by dos Santos (1999). The \n\nsecond factor is that most sampling stations were located over the outer shelf and the \n\nslope. Therefore, sampling may have missed the large abundances of coastal and \n\nestuarine species that several studies have recorded over the inner shelf in eastern \n\nmargins of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (dos Santos et al. 2008; Morgan et \n\nal. 2009; Queiroga 1996).  \n\nDuring the 2006 campaign in the Algarve, differences in species composition were \n\nobserved between coastal and offshore areas. The former was dominated by coastal \n\ncaridean shrimps, while the latter was dominated by open ocean and deep sea species \n\nsuch as the shrimps Sergestes spp. and Solenocera membranacea and the brachyuran \n\ncrab Monodaeus couchi. Species composition, both coastal and offshore, was similar \n\nto what has been previously observed in the Algarve under winter conditions (dos \n\nSantos 1999). Another important factor contrasting onshore with offshore waters was \n\nthe presence of estuarine species associated with the river outflow. Abundance and \n\ndiversity of the eastern part of the Algarve sampling region was highly influenced by \n\nthe discharge from the Guadiana river. The most coastal sampling sites in that area \n\nwas dominated by estuarine species which undergo part of the larval cycle offshore \n\n(e.g. Pilumnus spp., some Liocarcinus spp.).  \n\nIn 2007, decapod larvae composition was similar between the SW Alentejo and the \n\nSagres regions, which differed from the Algarve and NE Alentejo regions. While the \n\nmost abundant species in the Algarve were Monodaeus couchi and Goneplax \n\nrhomboides, the NE Alentejo was dominated by brachyuran crabs, namely Carcinus \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n159 \n\nmaenas, Cancer spp. and Atelecyclus rotundatus and by the anomuran Anapagurus \n\nspp.. The latter four taxa, encountered in most sampling locations in the NE Alentejo, \n\nwere completely absent offshore of the front. In addition, higher larval abundances \n\nwere observed over the continental shelf (100-200m depth) indicating that larvae are \n\nprobably being retained in this area in spite of the prolonged upwelling event that was \n\nobserved. Indeed, the wind and hydrographic data of 2007, as well as the model \n\ninterpretation, indicate that upwelling favorable winds originated the frontal structure \n\noff the Alentejo coast, separating the upwelled waters with northern origin from the \n\noffshore warmer and saltier waters with subtropical origin.  \n\nThe presence of coastal species in the NE Alentejo (Carcinus maenas, and Anapagurus \n\nspp.) greatly contributed to differentiate the assemblages across the front. Higher \n\nlarval abundances observed in the most coastal sampling location over the shelf \n\nindicated that coastal species were retained onshore (Figure 12 and 13). Such \n\nretention during upwelling events has largely been documented (e.g.: dos Santos et al. \n\n2008; Morgan et al. 2009; Queiroga et al. 2007) and has been linked to different kinds \n\nof depth-regulation behavior. Nevertheless these are coastal species and our sampling \n\ndesign therefore does not permit a full comprehension of larval dispersal as higher \n\nabundances are expected onshore and not on the external part of the continental \n\nshelf where our sampling was performed. This is however not the case for species \n\nwhich adults commonly inhabit the external area of the continental shelf such as \n\nCancer spp. and Atelecyclus spp.. The presence of adult populations over the shelf \n\nmost likely resulted in supply of larvae to this general area. Offshore larval abundance \n\nof C. spp. and Atelecyclus spp. in the NE Alentejo region increased with stage (Figure \n\n10 and 11) indicating that a small portion of the larvae were not retained over the \n\nshelf but were carried beyond the shelf break by the upwelled waters.  \n\nBecause of coastal topography, recirculation occurs in the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal bays, in \n\nthe north of the Alentejo region, especially in response to upwelling-favorable winds \n\n(Moita et al. 2003). At a larger scale, the ocean of the southwest Iberian region is \n\ncharacterized by the presence of two water masses separated by a W-E frontal zone \n\n\n\nDecapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal \n\n160 \n\nlocated between 38-39\u00baN (Peliz et al 2005). This frontal zone separates the colder and \n\nfresher waters of the subpolar branch of the Eastern North Atlantic Central Waters \n\n(ENACW) form warmer and saltier waters usually associated to the subtropical branch \n\nof the ENACW, which originates in the Azores region, and connects with the Gulf of \n\nCadiz and the southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula through the northern \n\nbranches of the Azores system of currents (Peliz et al 2007). Intrusions of these waters \n\nacross the W-E front are frequently observed, and it has been hypothesized that these \n\nintrusions are associated with the northward deflections of branches of the Azores \n\ncurrent in the vicinity of the Cape St. Vincent, in the Sagres region (Peliz et al. 2005). \n\nThe model results reproduce to some extent these patterns, showing a coastal \n\nsouthward flow and a northward flow offshore over the sampling area, as well warm \n\neddies derived from the Azores current further south and offshore (see Fig. 6). The \n\nnorthward flow of warm water west of the Alentejo predicted by the model between \n\n37.5 and 39.0\no \n\nN, which was deflected offshore by the upwelling event, may be a \n\nreflection of this. This interpretation is also supported by the observed hydrological \n\nfields that were very similar in the Sagres and the southwestern Alentejo areas. These \n\nmechanisms could underlie the similarity of the decapod larval assemblages of the SW \n\nAlentejo and of the Sagres regions (about 2/3 of the species were common to both \n\nareas), suggesting that the larvae present in the Sagres region were probably brought \n\nnorthward toward the southwestern part of Alentejo. Moreover, some input of larvae \n\nfrom northern areas such as the Lisbon bay might have impacted the decapod larval \n\ncomposition of the NE Alentejo. \n\nZooplankton abundance (Fig. 2f) was higher in the SW Alentejo and in the Algarve \n\nthan in the NE Alentejo, where very low levels were found in some stations. The low \n\nabundance of zooplankton in the NE Alentejo contrasts with the high abundance of \n\ndecapod larvae in this region, especially in the more coastal sampling sites. This \n\ndistribution of the zooplankton can be explained by the upwelling event assuming a \n\nsupply of recently upwelled water with low biomass of phyto- and zooplankton. While \n\ndistribution of holoplanktonic organisms depends exclusively on circulation patterns \n\nand water productivity, decapod larvae abundances depend on production from \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n161 \n\nbenthic dwelling females, which may decouple the abundances of both planktonic \n\ngroups. \n\nAs currents highly influence larval distribution, time evolution of the circulation \n\npatterns might explain the differences observed in species composition of offshore \n\nspecies in the Algarve area between the two years of sampling. The main difference \n\nobserved is the lower abundance of shrimp larvae caught in 2007. Indeed, excluding \n\nSergia robusta, all other species caught in 2006 were only found at very low densities \n\nthe following year (Table 1). Similarly, benthic species abundant in coastal waters in \n\n2006 were almost not encountered in 2007 such as the crabs Monodaeus couchi, \n\nGoneplax rhomboides and Pilumnus spp.. Those inter-annual differences may be due \n\nto various factors, including variations in current patterns, like presence of meddies, \n\nvariations in adult reproduction time and larval duration. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors thank Dr. Dave Conway and the crew of the RV \u201cNoruega\u201d for their \n\nindispensable support during the survey and F\u00e1tima Quintela for her help during \n\nsampling processing.

During the early phases of the \n\nlife cycle, the energetic demands are very high. Indeed, essential nutrients are \n\nrequired for proper organ development or successful metamorphosis. For this reasons, \n\nthe period of suboptimal food conditions at any point of the life cycle can significantly \n\naffect the subsequent stages such as larvae and post-settled individuals. Since \n\nembryonic development is lecithotrophic and food might not be readily available \n\nimmediately following birth, it can be assumed that the feeding status of females \n\nduring vitellogenesis will influence offspring survival (Gim\u00e9nez 2006, 2010; Pechenik \n\n2006). As inter-specific variability in fatty acid (FA) profiles are the results of different \n\necological niche and feeding regimes (Rosa et al. 2007a), it is likely that differences in \n\nhabitat or inter-annual variations in food conditions can result in within-brood \n\nvariations in embryonic biochemistry. The results of chapter 2 further indicate that \n\nthere is also, at least in Nephrops norvegicus, a high variability in FA composition \n\nbetween embryos of a single clutch. This differential female investment into the \n\nembryos and/or differential catabolism of yolk reserves by the embryo can explain why \n\nin the laboratory there is great within-clutch variability in larval survival. Suboptimal \n\npost hatching environmental conditions will further affect developing larvae (reviewed \n\nby Gim\u00e9nez 2006) and those that had lower energetic embryonic input may not be \n\nable to successfully reach the following larval stage, even though short term survival to \n\nsuboptimal food conditions can still be possible (e.g.: Calado et al. 2010; Gebauer et al. \n\n1999; Gim\u00e9nez and Anger 2003, 2005; Ritar et al. 2003b; Smith et al. 2004).  \n\nRegardless of the quality of maternal investment, and because of the unpredictable \n\nnature of the open ocean, larvae demonstrate significant plasticity in prey preference, \n\nfeeding on lower size and nutritional quality prey when adequate ones are absent \n\n(chapter 3). This shift in diet will also be accompanied by physiological adaptations, \n\nsuch as an increase in digestive enzymes activity (like protease activity increase in \n\nstarved first-stage N. norvegicus larvae; chapter 4). Additionally, an increase in gut \n\nevacuation time (GET) can also be expected as it has been observed in many decapod \n\nspecies (Jones et al. 1997). Both an increase of enzyme activity and GET will allow \n\n\n\nConcluding remarks \n\n170 \n\nlarvae to maximize nutrient assimilation in suboptimal food conditions (Kumlu 1999). \n\nOnce food conditions recover, prey quality and quantity being adequate again, feeding \n\nrate will increase in order to recover from a starvation period, such as it is observed in \n\nstage I and II of N. norvegicus in chapter 3. However, if starvation occurs over an \n\nextended period of time, and the larvae will not be able to recover and successful \n\ndevelopment will not occur (Anger and Dawirs 1981). Indeed, extended period of \n\nstarvation leads to damages to the hepatopancreatic cells and prevents the \n\naccumulation of lipids regardless of the quantity and quality of available food (Anger \n\n2001). The larvae will not be able to metamorphose to the next stage and death will \n\neventually occur (Anger 2001). As observed with amylase activity in starved newly \n\nhatched N. norvegicus, sustained starvation can result in a failure to trigger specific \n\ndigestive enzymes, which could translate into a deficiency in nutrients essential to \n\nsuccessful development and molting to the next larval stage. Since carbohydrates play \n\nan important role in the molting process (Luo et al. 2008), a failure to activate amylase \n\nactivity before reaching the end of larval stages, would probably negatively impact \n\nmetamorphosis (chapter 3). \n\nIn addition to food condition, predation pressure will also affect larval survival \n\nthroughout development. In order to avoid predation, one possible strategy is to \n\nperform a different type of DVM than their predators (Han and Straskraba 2001; \n\nPearre 2003). Monodaeus couchi represents a good example of such species, as they \n\nwere observed to perform reverse diel vertical migration off the coast of Portugal in \n\n2006 and 2007 (chapter 5). Such behavior however will also translate into lower prey \n\navailability to the organism performing that uncommon type of migration (Irigoien et \n\nal. 2004). Nevertheless, depending on the feeding strategy, if female nutrient input \n\ninto the yolk reserves is sufficient, the resistance to starvation will increase and the \n\nlarvae can develop successfully in an environment with lower predation pressure. \n\nNevertheless, unless the species is fully lecithotrophic, larvae will have to feed \n\neventually, and as larval size increases, prey preference will tend to shift towards \n\nlarger prey (as observed in N. norvegicus in chapter 3) and possibly to more energetic \n\nfood items.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n171 \n\nRegardless of the vertical migration strategy, the positioning in the water column as \n\nwell as survival will eventually influence dispersal and recruitment as larvae will be \n\ntransported by depth varying currents (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005). \n\nGlobal circulation patterns will dictate general trends in larval transport but short term \n\nvariations in environmental conditions, such as changes in atmospheric conditions, will \n\nresult in temporal difference in local larval composition and abundance. The low \n\nnumbers in larval abundances observed in chapter 5 and 6 can be explained by the \n\ntime of sampling (winter) combined, in the case of the Alentejo region, with the small \n\nsize of the shelf in that area. Indeed, dos Santos and Peliz (2005) indicated that very \n\nfew N. norvegicus larvae were encountered in the region despite the large adult \n\npopulation and similar results were observed for M. couchi. Modeling studies indicated \n\nthat only a small proportion of larvae hatching in the Algarve are likely to reach the \n\nAlentejo region. Marta-Almeida et al. (2008) modeled the potential dispersal of N. \n\nnorvegicus larvae off the coast of Algarve during the winter based on the estimated \n\narea of the adult populations and different vertical migration behavior scenarios of the \n\nlarvae. Since no difference in decapod abundance is observed between day and night \n\nsamples (chapter 5) and M. couchi exhibited reverse DVM between the surface and \n\n200 m (chapter 6), it can be assumed that DVM behavior of decapods larvae of the \n\nPortuguese coast during the winter are comparable to either the DVM200 (diel vertical \n\nmigration up to 200 m) or U200 (uniformly distributed in the top 200m) simulations of \n\nthe model (Marta-Almeida et al. 2008). For both type of behaviors, the results \n\nindicated that most of the larvae hatching in the Algarve were retained in that area, \n\nclose to the coast, in the area where decapod abundance was highest in our samples. \n\nIndeed, according to the model, very few larvae are transported towards the coast of \n\nAlentejo. This could explain the lower decapod larvae abundance encountered in that \n\narea in chapter 5, especially if the adult populations are reduced in this area due to the \n\nsmall width of the shelf. Those results are consistent with dos Santos and Peliz (2005) \n\nwhere N. norvegicus larvae were not observed in the Alentejo region despite the \n\npresence of an important population on the slope. Similarly, in our study, N. \n\nnorvegicus larvae were only collected in the Algarve. \n\n\n\nConcluding remarks \n\n172 \n\nUnpredictable events can either transport larval to a new habitat to colonize, or export \n\nit to an environment where settlement and therefore survival will not be possible. \n\nSuch a case is illustrated by the upwelling event that was occurring off the coast of \n\nAlentejo in the winter of 2007, causing the area to be divided by a front. Larval \n\ncomposition on each side of the front is clearly different, with a retention occurring for \n\ncoastal species in the NE area (chapter 6). The presence of adult populations over the \n\nshelf most likely resulted in constant supply of larvae in the area, explaining the higher \n\nlarval abundances in the most coastal locations of our sampling plan. Interestingly, the \n\nNE part of the Alentejo, influenced by upwelled chlorophyll poor waters, show lower \n\nzooplankton abundance. Indeed, the higher offshore abundance of zooplankton in the \n\nSW Alentejo, is not consistent with the higher decapod larvae abundances observed in \n\nthe NE Alentejo.  Differences in life cycle, in the benthic and localized origin of the \n\nlarvae contrasting with the largely unbounded production processes of holopkantonic \n\norganisms, as well as in behavior, most likely explain the observed differences.  \n\n \n\n7.2 Future works \n\nThe two species used in the present work are good models to better understand the \n\nearly life biology of deep-sea species and the evolution of adaptations to deep-sea \n\nhabitats. Both species occupy a range of depths from shallow shelf habitats to \n\nhundreds of meters (more than 1000 m in the case of M. couchi). M. couchi is a fairly \n\nwidespread species and its larvae are encountered at high densities at some places, \n\nbut the remoteness of the deeper adult habitats and the lack of commercial interest \n\nhave translated into little knowledge of its biology. In contrast, N. norvegicus is a much \n\nbetter studied species, especially in northern latitudes where adults inhabit shallower \n\nwaters. Its high commercial value facilitates the acquisition of benthic juveniles and \n\nadults from the fisheries. On the other hand, the decrease in population size as a result \n\nof overfishing, combined with low reproductive output and a wide offshore \n\ndistribution, result in low number of larvae present in the plankton off the Portuguese \n\ncoast and therefore hindered the study of its planktonic phase. In fact, during both \n\noceanographic campaigns of 2006 and 2007 only 4 larvae of N. norvegicus were \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n173 \n\nencountered each year (see Table 6.1). These abundances are much lower than those \n\nencountered previously by dos Santos and Peliz (2005). In their study, reporting data \n\ncollected between 1987 and 2001, annual variations in larval abundance were \n\nobserved, with a slight overall decrease over time. This reduction in larval abundance \n\nis however negligible when compared with abundances recorded in our study, which \n\nwere about two orders of magnitude lower than those recorded by dos Santos and \n\nPeliz (2005). Despite the variety of sampling techniques used in both this study and \n\nSantos and Peliz (2005) it is evident that the reproductive output of this population has \n\ndecreased as net differences alone cannot account for the observed decrease.  \n\nFor this reasons, and as performed in the present thesis, further works intending to \n\nincrease the knowledge of offshore benthic decapods should therefore focus a variety \n\nof species. Different species could therefore be used to serve as models to answer \n\nspecific questions. For instance, a better understanding of oocyte production and \n\nmaternal investment could be obtained from commercially harvested larger species, \n\nwhile laboratorial studies could focus on smaller species with shorter embryonic \n\ndevelopment and higher reproductive output. Studying ovigerous females maturating \n\nin the field and in the laboratory may help us to better understand vitellogenesis and \n\nhow the feeding status of the female influences nutrient allocation into produced \n\nembryos. In addition to maternal investment, variations in environmental conditions \n\nwithin the brooding chamber (e.g.: oxygen concentration, temperature, salinity, etc.) \n\nwill cause variations in embryonic metabolism, resulting in differential use of yolk \n\nreserves (Brante et al. 2003), and eventually leading to asynchronous larval hatching \n\n(Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). The exact cause of inter-individual and \n\nwithin-brood variability in embryonic biochemistry, as well as the resulting effect on \n\nlarval development and survival, still requires further investigation.  \n\nMost larval behaviors, either endo- or exogenously cued, are extremely difficult to \n\nstudy in situ. In the present thesis, laboratorial hatching of N. norvegicus proved to be \n\ndifficult and culture of this species to juvenile stage was unsuccessful. Most works on \n\nthis subject date back in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s (e.g.: Anger and Puschel 1986; Figueiredo \n\nand Vilela 1972) and to date larviculture of this species is still in its experimental phase. \n\nHatching and culturing healthy larvae in the laboratory is therefore needed. Potential \n\n\n\nConcluding remarks \n\n174 \n\nreasons for this failure include 1) the stress induced to females during capture and \n\ntransport, 2) unsuitable nutritional quality of the prey provided (Artemia sp. nauplii) or \n\n3) the morphology of the larvae itself, which possess large spinous processes along \n\ntheir body that are prone to injury upon contact with the walls of the culture chamber, \n\ncausing potential infections. While optimizing the culture of N. norvegicus, an \n\neconomically important species, is critical, more suitable candidates species, with \n\nhigher reproductive output, should be selected to get a better global understanding of \n\nlarval behavior of offshore benthic decapods. Laboratorial studies should investigate \n\nthe responses of different larval stages to changing environmental conditions, mainly \n\ntemperature, pressure and light, but also food availability. Long term effect of food \n\ndeprivation or ingestion of suboptimal prey, as well as inter-individual variability, still \n\nrequires further studies. In that sense, the use of biochemical tools allowing the \n\nevaluation of the physiological mechanisms and energetic state of reproducing \n\nfemales, embryos or larva (in some cases even at the individual level) holds many \n\npromises. Nevertheless, a full understanding of the processes regulating inter-\n\nindividual and within-brood variability in biochemical profiles of embryos and larvae is \n\nneeded, especially considering the ever-growing importance of the use of biomarkers \n\nin the study of populations (Dalsgaard et al. 2003).  \n\nA full understanding of the early life traits of offshore benthic decapods will therefore \n\nonly be achieved through a multi-disciplinary approach including: 1) field sampling and \n\noceanographic modeling to understand general larval behavior and dispersal, 2) small \n\nscale laboratory experiments to test individual larval responses, development and \n\nsurvival to changing environmental conditions; and 3) biochemical analyses to \n\nunderstand physiological adaptations of both embryos and larvae. Because of the \n\ncarry-over effect in response to suboptimal environmental conditions that was \n\nobserved in many decapod larvae, a holistic approach in the study of early life biology \n\n(starting at the embryo and finishing with juveniles) is advocated. Indeed, like it is the \n\ncase in this thesis, until recently, many studies focus on a single life phase, if not a \n\nsingle stage, when repercussions of suboptimal conditions often significantly affect the \n\nindividual later in life.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n175 \n\nReferences \n\nAnger, K., 2001.
