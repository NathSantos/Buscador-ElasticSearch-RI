Desde a \u00e9poca pr\u00e9-industrial at\u00e9 aos nossos dias, as press\u00f5es antropog\u00e9nicas t\u00eam contribu\u00eddo para o aumento dos n\u00edveis de di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2) na atmosfera e as previs\u00f5es apontam para que continue a aumentar. Este acumular das emiss\u00f5es p\u00f3s-industriais na atmosfera est\u00e1 a afectar o balan\u00e7o t\u00e9rmico do planeta e os n\u00edveis de carbonatos nos oceanos. Actualmente o aumento das temperaturas \u00e9 um assunto recorrente em qualquer debate acerca de impactos dos sistemas marinhos. A temperatura da \u00e1gua do mar est\u00e1 a aumentar a um ritmo sem precedentes. A cada dez anos, desde 1979, tem sido registado um aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia da superf\u00edcie do mar de 0.13 \u00b0C, bem como um aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia do oceano superior a 0.1 \u00b0C desde 1961. Apesar de o clima ser considerado um sistema imprevis\u00edvel, as previs\u00f5es actuais apontam para um aumento global da temperatura de 2 \u00b0C at\u00e9 2100. Estima-se que as ondas de calor, que actualmente t\u00eam uma dura\u00e7\u00e3o de uma a duas semanas ser\u00e3o, at\u00e9 2100, mais intensas, mais frequentes e mais duradouras.\nA temperatura do oceano tem uma forte influ\u00eancia na ecologia dos organismos marinhos, podendo provocar impactos significantes ao n\u00edvel das popula\u00e7\u00f5es, comunidades e ecossistemas. Um aumento da temperatura em 1 \u00b0C pode causar efeitos consider\u00e1veis na mortalidade e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica de alguns organismos, perturbando todo o ecossistema marinho.\nA maioria dos peixes s\u00e3o animais ectot\u00e9rmicos, isto \u00e9, a sua temperatura interna varia consoante a temperatura ambiente, o que resulta num aumento das taxas metab\u00f3licas numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o de aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia da \u00e1gua. Um dos principais pap\u00e9is nas reac\u00e7\u00f5es bioqu\u00edmicas envolvidas nos processos metab\u00f3licos \u00e9 desempenhado pela temperatura, de facto, um aumento de 10 \u00b0C pode duplicar ou triplicar as taxas de reac\u00e7\u00e3o - o que se reflecte em valores de sensibilidade t\u00e9rmica (Q10) de 2-3. Um aumento nas taxas metab\u00f3licas dos peixes promove o desenvolvimento de embri\u00f5es, reduz o per\u00edodo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o e aumenta as taxas de crescimentos. O aumento das taxas\nmetab\u00f3licas com o aumento da temperatura afecta tamb\u00e9m as taxas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, a digest\u00e3o d\u00e1-se mais rapidamente, as secre\u00e7\u00f5es g\u00e1stricas aumentam, bem como a absor\u00e7\u00e3o directa de nutrientes, o que leva a um esgotamento mais r\u00e1pido das reservas em caso de indisponibilidade de alimento. Acima de uma determinada temperatura, a temperatura pejus (Tp), a necessidade de oxig\u00e9nio atinge um pico, n\u00e3o sendo suficiente para cobrir as necessidades metab\u00f3licas do organismo. Apesar de a sobreviv\u00eancia n\u00e3o ser directamente afectada al\u00e9m da Tp, a capacidade de desempenhar outros mecanismos fisiol\u00f3gicos torna-se mais reduzida, o que, a longo-prazo, ser\u00e1 prejudicial para a sobreviv\u00eancia das esp\u00e9cies.\nAnimais como os cavalos-marinhos s\u00e3o particularmente sens\u00edveis a perturba\u00e7\u00f5es no seu habitat, dada a sua reduzida mobilidade, o que os torna num interessante modelo para investiga\u00e7\u00f5es no \u00e2mbito das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. Para al\u00e9m disso, os cavalos-marinhos vivem em \u00e1guas costeiras pouco profundas, sendo que estas \u00e1reas fechadas ser\u00e3o provavelmente mais afectadas pelo aquecimento global do que o mar aberto. As esp\u00e9cies de cavalos-marinhos est\u00e3o amea\u00e7adas um pouco por todo o mundo, deste modo, o impacto da s\u00fabita subida das temperaturas s\u00f3 ir\u00e1 aumentar o seu j\u00e1 elevado valor conservacionista. Todas as esp\u00e9cies de cavalos-marinhos encontram-se j\u00e1 listadas na Lista Vermelha de Esp\u00e9cies Amea\u00e7adas do IUCN, bem como no Ap\u00eandice II do CITES. H\u00e1, actualmente, um interesse crescente em estudos que focam o impacto das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas nos organismos marinhos, no entanto, n\u00e3o existem registos de investiga\u00e7\u00f5es sobre este assunto em cavalos-marinhos, exceptuando na \u00e1rea do desenvolvimento de t\u00e9cnicas de aquacultura. Destes, todos apontam para um impacto da temperatura ao n\u00edvel da sobreviv\u00eancia, crescimento, alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, comportamento, reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, e at\u00e9 colora\u00e7\u00e3o dos animais.\nNo presente estudo, compar\u00e1mos as taxas metab\u00f3licas e a sensibilidade t\u00e9rmica, de adultos e juvenis a quatro temperaturas. Para os adultos, compar\u00e1mos ainda as taxas de ventila\u00e7\u00e3o, as taxas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e os padr\u00f5es comportamentais \u00e0s mesmas quatro temperaturas. As temperaturas foram escolhidas de modo a reflector: a temperatura m\u00e9dia durante a Primavera (18 \u00b0C), a temperatura m\u00e9dia no Ver\u00e3o (26 \u00b0C), a temperatura m\u00e1xima registada em per\u00edodos de ondas de calor (28 \u00b0C) e a temperatura prevista num cen\u00e1rio de aquecimento global (28 \u00b0C + 2 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C) no estu\u00e1rio do Sado, em Portugal.\nO cavalo-marinho H. guttulatus encontra-se no nosso pa\u00eds maioritariamente em sistemas estuarinos ou lagunares. Estes, sendo peixes estuarinos, adaptam-se facilmente a\nComo esperado, os nossos resultados revelaram um aumento das taxas metab\u00f3licas e de ventila\u00e7\u00e3o com o aumento da temperatura, sem, no entanto, se demonstrarem stress t\u00e9rmico, com valores de sensibilidade t\u00e9rmica normais, mesmo para o intervalo de temperaturas mais elevadas (28 \u00b0C - 30 \u00b0C). Este elevado grau de adaptabilidade a varia\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura \u00e9 uma mais-valia para um animal com fracas capacidades natat\u00f3rias e reduzida mobilidade. No entanto, a longo prazo, a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a temperaturas extremas poder\u00e1 ter um impacto mais severo na ecologia da esp\u00e9cie.\nSurpreendentemente, o aumento da temperatura n\u00e3o provocou o resultado expect\u00e1vel nas taxas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o nem no comportamento dos cavalos-marinhos adultos. Seria esperado que as taxas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o acompanhassem o aumento da temperatura, e que o comportamento sofresse perturba\u00e7\u00f5es. Tal poder\u00e1 ser explicado, mais uma vez, pela capacidade de aclimata\u00e7\u00e3o a grandes varia\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura, e pelo comportamento passivo desta esp\u00e9cie.\nPor outro lado, os juvenis H. guttulatus revelaram-se mais sens\u00edveis ao aumento da temperatura, com um aumento significativamente superior das taxas metab\u00f3licas quando comparado com os adultos. De facto, o decl\u00ednio abrupto para valores de Q10 inferiores a 1.5, indica supress\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica quando expostos a temperaturas superiores a 28 \u00b0C, o que sugere que estas temperaturas se encontram fora do intervalo de toler\u00e2ncia t\u00e9rmica dos juvenis. Quando um organismo \u00e9 sujeito a temperaturas fora do seu intervalo de toler\u00e2ncia fica mais vulner\u00e1vel a factores externos, dando prioridade a processos osmoregulat\u00f3rios, e delegando para segundo plano outros processos fisiol\u00f3gicos menos cruciais para a sua sobreviv\u00eancia. No entanto, este estado de dorm\u00eancia do organismo pode ser prejudicial ao normal desenvolvimento dos juvenis e aumentar a sua vulnerabilidade \u00e0 preda\u00e7\u00e3o, indisponibilidade de alimento, ou doen\u00e7as.\nOs resultados obtidos neste estudo indicam que, apesar de os cavalos-marinhos adultos revelarem uma alta resili\u00eancia face ao stress t\u00e9rmico, os juvenis mostram uma elevada sensibilidade ao aumento das temperaturas. As caracter\u00edsticas dos cavalos-marinhos, como a reduzida mobilidade, tornam-nos mais vulner\u00e1veis \u00e0s perturba\u00e7\u00f5es subjacentes \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas no seu habitat, uma vez que n\u00e3o t\u00eam capacidade para migra\u00e7\u00f5es de longas dist\u00e2ncias, permanecendo confinados a \u00e1reas restritas.

More specifically, we compared routine metabolic rates, thermal sensitivity, ventilation rates, food intake, and behavioral patterns at average spring temperature (18 \u00b0C), average summer temperature (26 \u00b0C), temperatures that they endure during summer heat wave events (28 \u00b0C) and in a near-future warming scenario (+2 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C) in Sado estuary, Portugal. Both newborn juveniles and adults showed significant increases in metabolic rates with rising temperatures. However, newborns were more impacted by future warming via metabolic suppression. In adult stages, ventilation rates also increased significantly with environmental warming, but unexpectedly food intake remained unchanged. Moreover, the frequency of swimming, foraging, swinging and inactivity did not significantly change between the different thermal scenarios. Thus, we provide evidence that, while adult seahorses show great resilience to heat stress and are not expected to go through any physiological impairment and behavioral change with the projected near-future warming, the early stages display greater thermal sensitivity and will face greater metabolic challenges with potential cascading consequences for their growth and survival.\nKeywords: seahorse; Hippocampus guttulatus; ocean warming; climate change; metabolism; behavior\nIntroduction\nThe climate is changing and, in the future, the ecosystems may have changed as well. As a result of human activities, carbon dioxide (CO2) has greatly increased in the atmosphere, and is expected to continue increasing. The cumulative post-industrial CO2 emissions are affecting the heat balance of the earth and the carbonate equilibrium of the oceans. The increasing levels of oceanic CO2 and the global tendency for rising temperatures may act like synergistic effects on marine ecosystems, which might be exacerbated when combined with effects like oxygen deficiency (resulting from global warming) and anthropogenic eutrophication (Portner et al. 2004a). These combined factors may be dangerous for marine fauna, by reducing animal performance and harming populations.\nPresently, ocean warming is an omnipresent matter on every debate on marine system impacts (Halpern et al. 2008; Petit et al. 1999; Solomon et al. 2007). Surface temperature is rising at an unprecedented rate in human experience. There has been an increase in the mean global sea surface temperature of 0.13 \u00b0C per decade since 1979, and an increase in ocean interior temperature greater than 0.1 \u00b0C since 1961 (IPCC 2007). The climate systems are unpredictable but forecasts point to a global mean temperature rise of 2 \u00b0C by 2100 (Lenton et al. 2008; Santos et al. 2002; Miranda et al. 2002). Heat waves, which presently last for a period of one to two weeks (Miranda 2002), will become more intense, more frequent and last for longer periods in a warmer climate scenario (IPCC 2007).\nWater temperature has a great influence on the biology and ecology of marine organisms, and may lead to cascade effects on population, community and ecosystem dynamics. Many species are sensitive to temperatures just a few degrees higher than those they usually experience in nature. A rise in temperature as small as 1 \u00b0C can have important and rapid effects on mortality and geographic distribution of some organisms (Kennedy et al. 2002). In fact, rising temperatures are already affecting the abundance and distribution of species, and compromising the entire marine ecosystem (Brierley and Kingsford 2009; Perry et al. 2005).\nIn general, fishes are ectothermic, i.e. their internal temperature varies with the surrounding environmental temperature, which results in increased metabolic rates in a warming scenario (Roessig 2004). Temperature is one of the major factors influencing\nthe biochemical reactions involved in metabolic processes, so much that, a warming of 10 \u00b0C can double or triple the reaction rates, resulting in thermal sensitivity (Q10) values of 2-3 (Seibel and Drazen 2007; Gillooly et al. 2001). An increase in fish metabolic rates increases the growth rates, promotes the development of embryos and reduces the period of incubation (Love 1970). Increased metabolic rates at higher temperatures also affect the feeding rates: digestion becomes a faster process, the gastric secretions increase, as well as the direct absorption of nutrients, which leads to an enhanced depletion in the absence of available food resources in warmer waters (Love 1970). Above a certain temperature, also known as pejus temperature (Tp), oxygen delivery is maximal and cannot further rise to cover elevated metabolic demands, hence, the ability of an organism to increase aerobic metabolism is compromised (Portner et al. 2004b, 2005). Although survival is not immediately threatened beyond Tp, the ability to perform higher functions (e.g., feeding, growth, and reproduction) becomes limited (Portner and Knust 2007), which will influence the overall fitness and survival success of the species, especially on a long-term perspective.\nEven though the consequences of ocean warming may be less severe in fishes than in sessile animals, the peculiar characteristics of seahorses make them particularly sensitive to disturbances of their natural environment and a very interesting model for climate change studies. Migration from warmer to colder waters may be a less effective strategy against ocean warming in fishes with patchy distribution (associated with structurally complex habitats) and reduced mobility. Moreover, seahorses live in shallow coastal waters, which will be more impacted by global warming in the future than the open seas and oceans (Philipart 2011). Seahorses are already threatened worldwide by habitat degradation and overfishing, whereat additional stress from rapid climate change will add to its already high conservational value. All seahorse species are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and in the Appendix II of CITES. There is growing interest in studies that focus the impact of climate change on marine animals, but there are no reports of this matter on seahorses, except in the research field of aquaculture techniques. All these studies point that temperature may affect survival, growth, feeding, behavior, reproduction and even skin color of seahorses (Wong and Benzie 2003; Foster and Vincent 2004; Lin et al. 2006, 2009; Sheng et al. 2006; Koldewey and Martin-Smith 2010). Moreover, there are already some signs that seahorse populations may not respond well to extreme temperatures. In the Swartvlei estuary in South Africa, at least 3000 Hippocampus capensis were found dead and\nDue to their attractive appearance and peculiar ecology facts, like male pregnancy and monogamy, seahorses are considered flagship species for conservation campaigns (Foster and Vincent 2004), which makes them ideal species to draw attention to climate change issues. With the present study, we attempt to investigate the effects of increasing water temperature on the metabolic rates, feeding rates and behavior patterns of the temperate seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus. Hopefully, our data will contribute to a better understanding of the climate change effects on seahorses, taking a step forward on the prediction of animal response to the future expected conditions, which may support the development of new models and strategies, not only for seahorses as for other marine organisms as well.\nMaterial and Methods\nSpecimen collection and stocking conditions\nSeahorses, H. guttulatus, were collected near Caldeira de Tr\u00f3ia in the Sado estuary, Portugal (Figure 1), in October 2011. The seahorses were transferred to the aquaculture facilities in the Guia Marine Laboratory and kept in a recirculating system composed of 170 L glass aquaria (140x35x35 cm). Green plastic structures were provided as holdfasts for the seahorses. Water parameters were: temperature 20-22 \u00b0C, salinity 3435 and pH 8.2-8.3. Water quality was assured by a protein skimmer, bio balls and a UV sterilizer. Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates concentrations were analyzed weekly and kept below detection levels (0.1, 0.3 and 10.0 mg L-1, respectively). Photoperiod was defined as 14 h light:10 h dark cycles. H. guttulatus were fed ad libitum twice a day with frozen enriched Artemia and Mysis, except for the day prior to the experimental essays. Aquaria were cleaned daily and 10% water changes were made every week.\nAll fishes were wet-weighted and identified with color bead necklaces loosely hold around the neck with an elastic cotton string. During the first four weeks, adult fish were acclimatized to captive conditions and no experimental essays were run. After that, adult seahorses and newborn juveniles, from males captured pregnant and that gave birth in captivity, were acclimatized to four different temperature scenarios: i) the\nFigure 1. Map of the sampling area in Caldeira de Tr\u00f3ia, located in the mouth of the Sado Estuary, Portugal.\nOxygen consumption rates\nAdult seahorses\nA total of 15 specimens were used to determine the oxygen consumption rates (routine metabolic rates) of adult seahorses in each of the four temperature scenarios. Animals were placed in an intermittent flow-through respirometry set-up (Loligo Systems,\nDenmark; see Rosa and Seibel 2008, 2010). To avoid bacterial contaminations, the seawater was filtered (0.2 pm) and treated (50 mg L-1 streptomycin) before it was pumped at a constant flow rate (average 140 mL min-1) from a water-jacketed, gasequilibration column through the respirometers. Respirometers were immersed in a large thermostatted bath (Lauda) and acclimatized for 2 h to the specific water temperature. During acclimation, the water in the column was bubbled continuously to maintain incoming water at high O2 values (normoxia, 21% O2). After acclimation, the flow-through system was turned off and a Clarke-type O2 electrode was put in each respirometer. Each electrode was connected to a Strathkelvin Instruments 928 Oxygen Interface. The system Strathkelvin was calibrated using air-saturated seawater. Before and after each run, the experimental setup was calibrated and checked for electrode drift and microbial oxygen consumption. Each experiment was 6 h long: 2 h for acclimation and the following 4 h for oxygen measurement. During the experimental runs, fish were continuously observed in order to detect abnormal behaviors that could indicate stress. All experiments were carried out in darkness and at atmospheric pressure.\nJuvenile seahorses\nA total of 5 specimens were used to determine the oxygen consumption rates (routine metabolic rates) of newborn seahorses in each of the four temperature scenarios. Juveniles were incubated in sealed water-jacketed respirometry chambers (RC300 Respiration cell, Strathkelvin, North Lanarkshire, Scotland) containing filtered seawater mixed with antibiotics (50 mg L-1 streptomycin) to avoid bacterial respiration. For each temperature (18 \u00b0C, 26 \u00b0C, 28 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C), 5 animals were used. Water volumes were adjusted in relation to animal mass in order to minimize locomotion and stress but still allow spontaneous and routine activity rates of the newborns. Bacterial controls were conducted in parallel to correct for possible bacterial respiratory activity. The respiration chambers were placed in water baths (Lauda, Lauda-Konigshofen, Germany) to control temperature. To record oxygen concentrations, water samples were taken from each syringe, with a Hamilton gas-tight 500 pL syringe, and injected in a water-jacketed Clarke-type O2 electrode connected to a multi-channel oxygen interface (Strathkelvin, North Lanarkshire, Scotland). The duration of respiratory runs varied from 3 to 4:30 h. After the experiments, juveniles were weighed on a precision balance.\nThermal sensitivity\nwhere R(T1) and R(T2) represent the routine metabolic rates at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. Q10 values were calculated for the temperature intervals of 18-26 \u00b0C, 1828 \u00b0C and 18-30 \u00b0C.\nVentilation rates, food intake and behavioral patterns\nTen seahorses were individually placed in 27 L glass aquaria in a recirculating rearing system, and their ventilation rates, feeding rates and activity patterns were measured at each of the four temperature scenarios (18 \u00b0C, 26 \u00b0C, 28 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C). Acclimation to each temperature was done through a 2 h gradual increase in water temperature. Seahorses were fed 100 frozen enriched Artemia twice a day.\nGill ventilation rates were measured by counting the number of opercular beats per minute, before feeding. Food intake was determined by collecting and counting the leftovers at the end of the day. Behavioral patterns were analyzed for each seahorse during 15 min twice a day (30 min after each feeding), based on the ethogram described in Table 1.\nTable 1. Ethogram of Hippocampus guttulatus activity patterns.\nCategory\tBehavior Description\nSwimming (S)\tThe seahorse swims, moving actively the dorsal and pectoral fins.\nFeeding (F)\tThe seahorse tilts the body towards the aquarium floor in search for food, points the snout towards the prey, and swallows the prey with a suction force while a \u201cclicking\u201d sound can be heard.\nSwinging (Sg)\tThe seahorse remains attached to the holdfast, with slight movements of the head or body.\nInactivity (I)\tThe seahorse remains resting, without performing any kind of movement, while attached or unattached to the holdfast.\nStatistical analysis\nA two-way ANOVA was carried out in order to detect significant differences in routine metabolic rates between developmental stages (adult and newborn juveniles) and temperatures. The effect of temperature on ventilation rates, food intake and behavioural patterns of adult seahorses was evaluated using repeated measurements ANOVA.

All statistical analyses were performed for a significance level of 0.05, using Statistica 10.0 software.\nResults\nMetabolic rates and thermal sensitivity\nRoutine metabolic rates (RMR) were significantly affected by temperature and developmental stage (Figure 2; Table 2). Mean RMR increased with temperature from 2.40 \u00b1 0.33 (18 \u00b0C) to 5.37 \u00b1 1.21 pmol O2 g-1 h-1 (30 \u00b0C) in adult seahorses, and from 7.36 \u00b1 2.22 (18 \u00b0C) to 16.68 \u00b1 1.73 pmol O2 g-1 h-1 (30 \u00b0C) in newborn juveniles. The Q10 values of adult and newborn seahorses ranged mainly around normal values (2.02.5), except for juveniles at the highest temperature interval (Figure 3). Between 28 and 30 \u00b0C, the pronounced Q10 drop below 1.5 indicates metabolic suppression in newborn juveniles.\nSee Annex I for metabolic scaling relationships.\nFigure 2.

In the Portuguese coast, they are found mainly in estuary mouths and lagoon systems, being subject to great temperature fluctuations throughout the day and year. In Portugal, the mean coastal temperature in estuarine waters is 18 \u00b0C in spring and 26 \u00b0C in summer, although during summer heat waves it can reach 28 \u00b0C. This eurythermic animal is therefore able to acclimatize and adapt to temperature oscillations, but will he be prepared for a warmer environment?\nLike most fishes, seahorses are ectothermic and their body temperature fluctuates with external temperature. As expected, H. guttulatus metabolism increased with water temperature. In adults, the increase of metabolic rates from 2.40 at 18 \u00b0C to 5.37 |imol O2 g-1 h-1 at 30 \u00b0C resulted in normal values of thermal sensitivity (Q10 values around 2), even for the highest temperature interval tested (28-30 \u00b0C), which suggests that they were not under severe thermal stress. Given the poor swimming skills and low mobility of adult seahorses, their great thermal tolerance is extremely important and will allow them to face future increases in water temperature.\nAlthough H. guttulatus has shown to tolerate well high temperatures until at least 30 \u00b0C, extreme temperatures may however have a negative impact on several aspects of seahorse life. Temperature has shown to have a positive effect on seahorse reproduction, but only until the optimal temperature is reached. In the tropical seahorse H. kuda, the developmental time of gonads decreased while the gonadosomatic index and fecundity, fertility and initial juvenile survival rates increased with temperature, but not indefinitely. After 30 \u00b0C, all the parameters start showing a reverse negative trend (Lin et al. 2006).\nThe increase in the metabolic rates of adult seahorses with warming was, as expected, accompanied by an increase in the ventilation rates but, unexpectedly, no changes were observed in the food intake and activity patterns. In general, food intake increases with temperature until a certain limit is reached, as observed in H. trimaculatus juveniles (Sheng et al. 2006). Moreover, activity patterns are also expected to change with temperature. The lack of differences in food intake and behavior between the different temperature scenarios may be explained by the referred ability of the species to adapt to great temperature fluctuations, as they endure in their habitat. Furthermore, as observed\nIn contrast to adult seahorses, H. guttulatus juveniles proved to be much more sensitive to warming. The metabolic rates of newborn juveniles increased significantly more with temperature than those of adult seahorses. Indeed, the abrupt decline in their thermal sensitivity to values below 1.5 indicates active metabolic suppression of early stages when exposed to temperatures higher than 28 \u00b0C. Our data suggest that such temperatures are already outside the temperature tolerance window of the early stages (i.e., beyond the critical temperature) and, therefore, their fitness and survival success will be compromised due to oxygen deficiency (Portner et al. 2004b, 2005). Increased metabolic rates cause an increase in oxygen demand, but higher temperatures result in less dissolved oxygen in the water. Both factors combined might thus act as synergistic stressors and be too overwhelming to the cardiorespiratory processes that suffer a decline in the efficiency to sustain muscular activity, growth and, at a critical point, the survival of the fish (Portner and Knust 2007).\nSeveral studies have shown that, although a rise in water temperature can be positive and result in faster growth and greater survival of newborn juveniles (Lin et al. 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010), these factors may become compromised after a certain temperature is reached. Growth, condition and survival of newborn H. erectus decreased after 28-29 \u00b0C (Lin et al. 2008). Beyond 30 \u00b0C, the survival of juvenile H. kuda was compromised (Lin et al. 2006) and the feeding rates of H. trimaculatus juveniles decreased (Sheng et al. 2006). 3.5 month-old H. whitei juveniles also presented faster growth but a lower condition factor and hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indexes at higher temperatures (Wong and Benzie 2003). From a physiological point of view, these findings may be explained at the light of metabolic suppression.\nMetabolic suppression is a defense mechanism to unsuitable external factors, including temperature among others. In this way, the organism puts some biological processes in stand-by as a strategy for energy saving, prioritizing the survival of the individual. One example is the protein synthesis, which has a significant energy cost and suffers a significant decrease when the organism needs to save energy for more crucial processes (Boutilier 2001; Guppy and Withers 1999). However, metabolic suppression might\njeopardize the normal development and increase vulnerability to other stressors like predation, starvation or diseases (Portner and Knust 2007; Wang and Overgaard 2007). With this study we provide evidence that, while adult seahorses show great resilience to heat stress and are not expected to go through any physiological impairment and behavioral change with the projected near-future warming, the early stages display greater thermal sensitivity and will face greater metabolic challenges with potential cascading consequences for their growth and survival. Even though seahorse life history characteristics such as short-generation time, rapid growth and early maturation may enable them to have a certain level of adaptability and resilience to environmental disturbance (Curtis and Vincent 2006), other characteristics such as small home ranges and low mobility might be harmful in a climate change scenario, since they are generally confined to a small area and have no capacity of long distance migrations (Foster and Vincent 2004; Curtis and Vincent 2006). The greater sensitivity of newborn juveniles to higher temperatures and their great vulnerability to long-term ocean warming indicates that early stages can be the bottleneck for population adaptability in a climate change perspective.\nSeahorses are charismatic fishes that have the potential to become symbols of estuarine area protection. Their unique aspect and curious life strategy turns them into perfect flagship species for marine conservation issues, so, it is important to understand their vulnerabilities and their responses to the near-future scenario of climate change.\nAcknowledgments\nThe Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) supported this study through project grant PTDC/MAR/0908066/2008 to R.
