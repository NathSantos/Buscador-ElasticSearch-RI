An \n\ninnovative and interesting way of protecting a local coastal zone by means of multi-\n\nfunctional artificial reefs avoids some of them. A multi-functional artificial reef is a \n\nsubmerged breakwater which, besides the helping to protect the local coastline, can \n\noffer other purposes; in particular, it may enhance the surfing possibilities and the \n\nenvironmental value of the local area. The structure has several positive side-effects: \n\nfirst, it provides an unimpaired visual amenity; second, it offers tourist and economic \n\nbenefits by improving the surfing conditions; third, it can enhance the environmental \n\nvalue of the area where it is built, and fourth, with a proper design the down drift \n\nerosion can be minimal. \n\nAn optimal reef design for the Leirosa beach, located to the south of Figueira da Foz, \n\nmidway along the Portuguese West Atlantic coast, is investigated. In order to achieve \n\nthis optimal design several steps were conducted. A preliminary design, as a result of a \n\ntheoretical study, achieved step by step, is proposed for a multi-functional artificial reef \n\nmaking use of the theory and of the state of the art. The proposed reef geometry is used \n\nas initial design in the numerical and physical tests, which were executed to analyze the \n\ncapacity of a multi-functional reef breakwater to protect the local coastline of Leirosa, \n\nPortugal, and to increase the local surfing possibilities. Further, a physical and a \n\nnumerical 2DV study have been executed to get insight in the influence of the length of \n\nthe reef and in the submergence on the Iribarren number, which is an indication for the \n\nbreaker type. In this study, also the optimum height for the reef has been defined. \n\nSubsequently, in order to be able to investigate the three design parameters: the reef \n\nangle, the geometry of the reef (with or without a platform) and the horizontal \n\ndimensions in 2DH for the optimal geometry, the Boussinesq-type COULWAVE model \n\nwas validated; finally, a 2DH numerical study has been conducted with COULWAVE \n\nto define the best values for these parameters. \n\nIn terms of surfability, and for the conditions of the local coastline of Leirosa, the \n\nfollowing values for the main parameters were found: a reef angle of 66\u00b0, a structure \n\nheight of 3.20 m, a reef geometry composed by a delta without platform, a reef \n\nsubmergence of 1.50 m and a structure seaward slope of 1:10.  \n\nThe calibration of the numerical model COULWAVE has shown that it can be used \n\nvery well to simulate the hydrodynamics around an MFAR. However, improvements \n\nare recommended on the actual version of COULWAVE. These improvements include \n\nmainly the introduction of bottom porous structures. Even though the mean velocity \n\nfields give an indication about the sediment transport, they are not sufficient to get a \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\nVI  \n\ndeep insight about the influence of an MFAR on the morphology around the structure. \n\nFor a proper design of the reef, particularly for the protection of a local coastline, a \n\nmorphological study has to be executed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nResumo \n\nVII  \n\nRESUMO \n\nPortugal \u00e9 um dos muitos pa\u00edses no mundo que sofre os efeitos adversos da eros\u00e3o \n\ncosteira. \u00c9 sabido que as formas convencionais de protec\u00e7\u00e3o costeira apresentam \n\nalgumas desvantagens. Uma forma particularmente interessante de proteger ou \n\ncontribuir para a protec\u00e7\u00e3o local de um tro\u00e7o da zona costeira, minimizando algumas \n\ndas desvantagens das estruturas tradicionais, \u00e9 atrav\u00e9s da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de recifes \n\nartificiais multi-funcionais. Um recife artificial multi-funcional \u00e9 um quebra-mar \n\nsubmerso constru\u00eddo com objectivos de ajudar a proteger localmente a zona costeira e \n\noferecer outras val\u00eancias, nomeadamente, aumentar as possibilidades locais para a \n\npr\u00e1tica de surf e contribuir para a valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental da regi\u00e3o.  \n\nUm recife artificial com estas caracter\u00edsticas apresenta diversos aspectos positivos. Com \n\nefeito, esta estrutura: (1) n\u00e3o tem qualquer impacto visual negativo; (2) oferece os \n\nbenef\u00edcios econ\u00f3micos resultantes da atrac\u00e7\u00e3o tur\u00edstica, ao melhorar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es locais \n\npara pr\u00e1ticas de surf e/ou outros desportos n\u00e1uticos (mergulho e pesca); (3) permite \n\naumentar o valor ambiental da regi\u00e3o, e (4) com um projecto adequado permite reduzir \n\nao m\u00ednimo os efeitos adversos da eros\u00e3o local ou prolongar mesmo a praia por efeito de \n\nt\u00f4mbolo. \n\nNeste trabalho s\u00e3o investigados os par\u00e2metros caracter\u00edsticos de um recife artificial \n\nmulti-funcional, tendo como caso de estudo um tro\u00e7o da zona costeira da Leirosa, \n\nsituado a cerca de 15 km a sul da Figueira da Foz, Portugal. Para obter as caracter\u00edsticas \n\n\u00f3ptimas da estrutura a construir foram realizados v\u00e1rios estudos ao longo de diversas \n\netapas. Como resultado do estado da arte e de um estudo te\u00f3rico, realizado passo a \n\npasso, \u00e9 proposta uma geometria preliminar de recife artificial multi-funcional. Esta \n\ngeometria preliminar do recife \u00e9 em seguida utilizada como projecto inicial de diversos \n\ntestes em modelo num\u00e9rico e em modelo f\u00edsico para analisar a sua capacidade na \n\nprotec\u00e7\u00e3o da praia e do cord\u00e3o dunar da Leirosa e, em simult\u00e2neo, analisar as \n\npossibilidades locais para a pr\u00e1tica de surf.  \n\nAl\u00e9m dos testes realizados em modelo f\u00edsico, foi efectuado um estudo num\u00e9rico \n\nutilizando o modelo 2DV COBRAS-UC para obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a influ\u00eancia do \n\ncomprimento do recife e da submers\u00e3o do mesmo no n\u00famero Iribarren, sendo este um \n\npar\u00e2metro que fornece uma boa indica\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo de rebenta\u00e7\u00e3o a esperar. Neste estudo \n\nfoi igualmente investigada a altura ideal para o recife. Posteriormente, procedeu-se \u00e0 \n\nvalida\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo num\u00e9rico 2DH do tipo Boussinesq, o modelo COULWAVE, \n\ntendo como objectivo analisar a influ\u00eancia de tr\u00eas par\u00e2metros de projecto com particular \n\ndesenvolvimento no plano horizontal: o \u00e2ngulo do recife, a geometria do recife (com ou \n\nsem plataforma) e as suas dimens\u00f5es horizontais. Uma vez validado, foi este modelo \n\n\n\nResumo \n\nVIII  \n\nnum\u00e9rico utilizado para analisar a influ\u00eancia daqueles par\u00e2metros e identificar os seus \n\nvalores mais adequados para a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de uma geometria optimizada do recife. \n\nEm termos de caracter\u00edsticas para a pr\u00e1tica de surf, e para as condi\u00e7\u00f5es locais do litoral \n\nda Leirosa, foram identificados os seguintes valores para os principais par\u00e2metros: uma \n\nestrutura de recife com \u00e2ngulo de 66\u00ba, altura de 3.20 m e uma geometria composta por \n\num delta sem plataforma, uma submers\u00e3o do recife de 1.50 m e um declive de barlamar \n\nda estrutura de 1:10. \n\nA calibra\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo num\u00e9rico COULWAVE mostrou que este pode ser usado com \n\nsucesso para simular a hidrodin\u00e2mica em torno de um recife artificial multi-funcional. \n\nNo entanto, recomendam-se melhorias na actual vers\u00e3o deste modelo. Tais melhorias \n\nincluem principalmente a possibilidade de modela\u00e7\u00e3o com fundos porosos. Embora os \n\ncampos da velocidade m\u00e9dia forne\u00e7am uma primeira indica\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o transporte de \n\nsedimentos, esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 por si s\u00f3 suficientemente profunda para obter \n\nconclus\u00f5es definitivas quanto \u00e0 influ\u00eancia de uma estrutura com estas caracter\u00edsticas \n\nsobre a morfologia local. Para uma concep\u00e7\u00e3o mais adequada da estrutura final do \n\nrecife, em particular para efeitos de protec\u00e7\u00e3o costeira, dever\u00e1 ser elaborado um estudo \n\nmorfodin\u00e2mico. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTable of contents \n\nIX  \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements III \n\nAbstract V \n\nResumo VII \n\nTable of contents IX \n\nList of figures XIII \n\nList of tables XVII \n\nList of symbols XIX \n\nList of Abbreviations XXI \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1 DEFINITION OF COASTAL ZONES \n\nThe nomenclature is not standardized, and various authors describe the same features \n\nusing different names. This ambiguity is especially evident in the terminology used for \n\nthe subzones of the shore and littoral areas. In the absence of a widely accepted standard \n\nnomenclature, coastal researchers would do well to accompany their reports and \n\npublications with diagrams and definitions to ensure that readers will fully understand \n\ntheir use of terms. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1.1 the coastal zone is divided into four main subzones: Coast, \n\nShore, Nearshore or Shoreface and Continent shelf - Offshore.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1 - Landforms and terminology of coastal zones (Thurman and Trujillo, 1999). \n\n \n\nEach of the following definitions applies (Army Corps of Engineers, 1992):   \n\n\u2022 The coast is a strip of land of indefinite width that extends from the coastline inland \n\nas far as the first major change in topography. Cliffs, frontal dunes, or a line of \n\npermanent vegetation usually mark this inland boundary. On barrier coasts, the \n\ndistinctive back barrier lagoon/marsh/tidal creek complex is considered part of the \n\ncoast. The area experiencing regular tidal exchange can serve as a practical landward \n\nlimit of the coast. The seaward boundary of the coast, the coastline, is the maximum \n\nreach of storm waves. \n\n\u2022 The shore extends from the low-water line to the normal landward line of storm \n\neffects, i.e., the coastline. Where beaches occur, the shore can be divided into two \n\nzones: backshore (or berm), above the high-tide shoreline, which is covered with \n\nwater only during storms, and the foreshore (or beach face). The foreshore extends \n\nfrom the low-water line to the limit of wave uprush at high tide, so it is the portion \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 4  \n\nexposed at low tide and submerged at high tide. The backshore is nearly horizontal \n\nwhile the foreshore slopes seaward.  This distinctive change in slope, which marks \n\nthe junction of the foreshore and backshore, is called the beach or berm crest. \n\n\u2022 The nearshore, also shoreface, is the seaward-dipping zone that extends from the \n\nlow-water line offshore to a gradual change to a flatter slope, denoting the beginning \n\nis the continental shelf. The continental shelf transition is the toe of the shoreface. Its \n\nlocation can only be marked approximately, because of the gradual slope change. \n\nThe nearshore is never exposed to the atmosphere, but is affected by waves that \n\ntouch bottom. It is the zone of most frequent and vigorous sediment transport, \n\nespecially the upper part. \n\n\u2022 The continental shelf is the shallow seafloor that borders most continents. The shelf \n\nfloor extends from the toe of the shoreface to the shelf break where the steeply \n\ninclined continental slope begins. It has been common practice to subdivide the shelf \n\ninto inner-, mid-, and outer zones, although there are no regularly occurring \n\ngeomorphic features on most shelves that suggest a basis for these subdivisions.  \n\n \n\nBeaches include both the shore and nearshore subzones. They are composed of the \n\nmaterial \u2013 sediment \u2013 primarily provided by the erosion of beach cliffs and/or by rivers \n\nthat drain lowland areas. Other sources of materials, like shell fragments and the \n\nremains of microscopic organisms that live in the coastal waters, are less common. \n\nBeaches on volcanic islands are frequently composed of dark fragments of the basaltic \n\nlava that make up islands, or of coarse debris from coral reefs that develop around \n\nislands in low latitudes. Thus, around the world, there are beaches composed of crushed \n\ncoral, beaches made of quartz sand, beaches made of rock fragments, beaches made of \n\nblack (or even green) volcanic material, beaches composed of shell fragments, and even \n\nartificial beaches composed of scrap metal dumped at the beach (Thurman and Trujillo, \n\n1999). \n\nIn general sediments consisting of sand and gravel occur on the upper and middle \n\nshoreface, muds of fluvial origin occur on the shelf and mixed sands and muds are \n\nfound in the lower shoreface zone (transition zone to shelf). Bed sediments generally \n\nfine in seaward direction, supplied by offshore-directed bottom currents (rip currents \n\nand storm-induced currents). Sometimes relatively coarse-grained relict sediments are \n\nfound on the shoreface. \n\n1.2 COASTAL USES AND VULNERABILITIES  \n\nThe coastlines of many countries have not only been shaped by natural forces but, \n\nover the last few centuries especially, they have also been strongly influenced by \n\npeople. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 5  \n\nEarly communities adopted a subsistence way of life which, compared with today\u2019s \n\nlifestyles, had a low impact on the natural heritage of the coast; these communities lived \n\nin relative harmony with their environment. \n\nThis is easily explained because in past centuries the littoral was always an area with \n\nlittle attraction, to be avoided at all costs. Apart from fishing communities and ports, \n\nthere was little to attract people to the coast - quite the contrary, in fact. Climatically it \n\nis an area of contrast, hot during the day and cold at night, windy, and without \n\nprotection against the sun. In terms of resources there was little to exploit except for \n\nfisheries and harbours. On the other hand it was a dangerous area. People living there \n\n(mostly fishermen) were rude; pirate raids were frequent, killing and looting the local \n\npopulace. Consequently, the littoral was for a long time a very sparsely populated area \n\n(Dias et al., 2002). \n\nThe awakening interest in the sea and the beaches appears all over Europe from the \n\nend of the 19th century. This was when the first bathing beaches started to spring up \n\neverywhere, particularly in France and Britain. \n\nFrom the end of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century the occupation \n\nof the littoral can be said to have been of a therapeutic character, as the objective of \n\nbathers when they left their houses carrying their bags and baggage to the beach resorts \n\nwas to \u201cgo to the baths\u201d. This consisted of exposing oneself to the waves at the beach. \n\nThe practice was prescribed medically, being indicated as a treatment for several \n\nphysical illnesses or states of mind, and applied to adults and children. Baths in the sea \n\nwere taken \u201cas remedy, not for pleasure\u201d (Cola\u00e7o and Archer, 1943, in Dias et al., \n\n2002).  \n\nThe 20th century saw changes in the way of looking at the littoral. It became a place \n\nfor pleasure, where the beach played an important role in leisure, and became a popular \n\nholiday destination. \n\nIt is a matter of fact that major social and economic changes over the last few \n\nhundred years in many countries, including Portugal, have resulted in dramatic changes \n\nto the character and natural heritage of the coastline. More intensive farming, coastal \n\ndevelopment and better access to the coast have all affected the natural coastal \n\nprocesses and led to a loss of habitat and wild coastal land. The bigger cities have \n\ngrown and spread along the coastline and numerous towns have developed, mostly as \n\nfishing ports, on mainland and island coasts alike. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 6  \n\nSome indicators are easily stated (Ten Voorde et al, 2009): \n\n\u2022 20% and 40% of people live within 30 km and 100 km of the coast, respectively; \n\n\u2022 coastal populations are growing more rapidly than global populations, mainly in \n\nurban settings; \n\n\u2022 global mean sea levels rose 10 to 20 cm in the 20th century; \n\n\u2022 in the 21st century, human-induced climate change will contribute to a global rise of \n\n20 to 100 cm, with a mid estimate of 50 cm; \n\n\u2022 other climate factors relevant to the coast will also change, although details are \n\nunclear. \n\nAll around the world, mega-cities (cities with more than 10 million people) are \n\nincreasing in number as the global human population continues to become more urban. \n\nBy the end of 2030, three-fifths of the world population will be living in urban areas. \n\nMuch of this urban growth occurs outside defined city boundaries and the resulting \n\nexpansion of urban or \u201cbuilt-up\u201d areas can be clearly seen from orbiting satellites. As a \n\nconsequence, the degradation of coastal ecosystems is to be expected, as well as \n\nincreased pollution of coastal waters. \n\nGlobal warming will lead to dramatic coastal changes in the near future. In fact, the \n\ngreenhouse effect and resulting warming of the earth\u2019s temperature may accelerate the \n\nmean sea level. A rise in the mean sea level would cause erosion, flooding, and \n\nsaltwater intrusion in bays and estuaries.  \n\n \n\nAn extensive study of coastal problems has been conducted under the EUROSION \n\nproject (Eurosion, 2004). This project entailed 60 case studies, considered to be \n\nrepresentative of European coastal diversity. The case studies reveal many erosion \n\nproblems along the European Atlantic coast. The Atlantic Ocean borders Western \n\nEurope around the following EU countries: the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain \n\nand Portugal. Generally speaking, the coastline around the Atlantic Ocean is made up of \n\nhard and soft cliffs interspersed with sandy and shingle beaches and dunes (Eurosion, \n\n2004). The high relief, hard cliffs and rocky coastlines are mostly found in northern \n\nSpain, northern Portugal and parts of northern France. The softer coasts may be found \n\nin western Ireland (e.g. Donegal and Rosslare) and the southern United Kingdom \n\n(Sussex), where soft cliffs with shingle and sand beaches and smaller dunes alternate \n\nwith small bays and estuaries. Larger, extensive dunes are found on the southwest coast \n\nof France (Aquitaine).  \n\nErosion of the Atlantic coastline, as has occurred in Estela, on the coast of Portugal \n\n(Figure 1.2), is a consequence of natural and human-induced factors (Gomes and Pinto, \n\n2006). The high-energy, storm generated waves from the Northern Atlantic and the \n\nmacro-tidal regime (medium range 2-4 m, maximum up to 15 m in the Bay of Mont \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 7  \n\nSaint-Michel, France), are the dominant erosive forces on the continental European \n\nAtlantic coastline. Together they create extreme conditions with strong alongshore tides \n\nand/or wave driven currents and cross-shore wave driven currents that can easily erode \n\nbeaches and undermine cliffs. Climate change is expected to induce accelerated sea \n\nlevel rise (at present 2-4 mm/yr) at some point in the future, as well as a potential \n\nincrease in storminess. Both will worsen erosion along the Atlantic coast. Human \n\ninterference, such as the construction of seawalls or groynes, damming of rivers and \n\nsand mining, has intensified erosion locally.   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.2 - Estela golf course, critical erosion zones (Gomes and Pinto, 2006). \n\n \n\nIn both northern and southern Europe erosion threatens urbanization (the safety of \n\nhuman lives and investments), tourism and nature. Furthermore, in Spain, Portugal and \n\nFrance fishing and aquaculture are of great importance in the coastal zone. In the United \n\nKingdom and Ireland, a lot of agricultural land is found in the coastal zone. The \n\nexplosive growth of the population in the littoral zone, partly due to tourism, has \n\nincreased the pressure on the coast, especially in France, Spain and Portugal and the \n\nsouth coast of England. It appears that most of the European Atlantic coastal areas are at \n\nhigh risk due to the low-lying coastal plains that are at risk of flooding (Eurosion, \n\n2004).  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 8  \n\nThe \u2018hold the line\u2019 policy option is often applied when seaside resorts or other \n\nrecreational facilities are at risk. This is especially true in France, Spain and Portugal \n\nbut it is often relevant in the south of England and Ireland, too, where tourism plays a \n\nleading role in the protected sites. Furthermore, high population densities and economic \n\ninvestments are protected by applying the \u2018hold the line\u2019 policy, as in the United \n\nKingdom, Ireland and Portugal (Eurosion, 2004).  \n\n\u2018Managed realignment\u2019 is possible at some of the seaside resorts and recreational \n\nfacilities if the amount of capital at risk is relatively small and the recreational facilities \n\nor houses can be moved inland without too many problems. In a flooding area, a new \n\ndefense line is usually defined (under the principle of \u2018Managed realignment\u2019). \u2018Do \n\nnothing\u2019 is usually applied to cliff coasts where there are no flooding risks and therefore \n\nthe amount of capital at risk is relatively low.  \n\nAt many sites along the Atlantic coast, a mixture of hard and soft engineering \n\nsolutions is adopted to deal with erosion. Various types of hard solutions had been \n\napplied in the cases considered. Although applied in nearly all cases, beach \n\nnourishments are executed on a much smaller scale (in terms of m3) than in the North \n\nSea and the Baltic regions. Whereas in the North Sea regions soft measures are often \n\nimplemented to combat erosion, along the Atlantic coasts the soft solutions are often \n\ncombined with hard measures. The high energy conditions of the coast and the steep \n\nforeshore mean that nourished sediment is quickly transported in an offshore direction, \n\nand it might not return by means of the equilibrium movement during the year.  \n\n1.3 GENERAL PROTECTION MEASURES \n\nExperience has shown that as yet there is no miracle solution to counteract the \n\nadverse effects of coastal erosion (Eurosion, 2004). The best results have been achieved \n\nby combining different types of coastal defense including hard and soft solutions, taking \n\nadvantage of their respective benefits while mitigating their respective drawbacks. Since \n\nit can be seen that coastal erosion results from a combination of various natural and \n\nhuman-induced factors it is not surprising that miracle solutions to counteract the \n\nadverse effects don\u2019t exist. Nevertheless, the general principle of \u201cworking with nature\u201d \n\nwas proposed as a starting point in the search for a cost-effective measure. However, \n\nthis observation also undeniably takes on board the idea that soft engineering solutions \n\nare preferable to hard ones. This is backed by a number of considerations derived from \n\nexperience (Eurosion, 2004):  \n\n\u2022 Even tried and tested soft solutions - such as beach nourishment, which aroused \n\ntremendous enthusiasm in the 1990\u2019s - have suffered serious setbacks. Such setbacks \n\nhave been caused by inappropriate nourishment scheme design induced by poor \n\nunderstanding of sediment processes (technical setback), difficult access to sand \n\nreserves which leads to higher costs (financial setback), or unexpected adverse \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 9  \n\neffects on the natural system - principally the benthic fauna - (environmental \n\nsetback). These are well covered by, respectively, the case of Vale do Lobo \n\n(Portugal) where 700 000 cubic metres and 3.2 millions euros of investment have \n\nbeen washed away by longshore drift within a few weeks only, the case of Ebro \n\nwhere the amount of sediment needed to recharge the beach sediments had been \n\nimported from another region, and the case of Sitges (Spain) where the dredging of \n\nsand to be supplied has caused irreversible damage to sea grass communities \n\n(Posidonia).  \n\n\u2022 Soft solutions, due to their particularity of working with nature, are found to be \n\neffective only in a medium to long-term perspective, i.e. when coastal erosion does \n\nnot constitute a risk in the short-term (5 to 10 years). Their impacts do indeed slow \n\ndown coastline retreat, but they don\u2019t stop it. The long term positive effect of soft \n\nsolutions may be optimized by hard structures which make it possible to tackle an \n\nerosion problem efficiently but have a limited lifetime (in general no more than 10 \n\nyears). This has been particularly well-documented for example in the case of Petite \n\nCamargue (France), where the presence of hard structures - condemned anyway \u2013 \n\nalso turned out to provide sufficient visibility for soft defense such as dune \n\nrestoration wind-screens to operate.  \n\n \n\nSeveral technical measures can be taken to combat erosion: \n\n\u2022 Hard measures  \n\nHard measures are structures like seawalls, revetment/slope protections, groynes and \n\ndetached breakwaters. The case studies show that hard measures can work really well \n\nif the consequences are accepted. If erosion is predicted for and accepted elsewhere, \n\nthe overall performance can be good. On several places of the Atlantic coast, strong \n\nstructures need to be built to resist extreme events that bring very large waves. \n\n\u2022 Soft measures  \n\nSoft measures are those like beach and dune nourishment, submerged nourishment, \n\nvegetation techniques and cliff stabilization. Soft measures can be a short term \n\nsolution. Erosion can continue at the same rate and soon the action (measure) needs \n\nto be repeated. This is especially true in the Atlantic where wave heights and tidal \n\namplitudes can be quite large.  \n\n\u2022 Combined measures  \n\nAt many sites along the Atlantic coast, a combination of hard and soft engineering \n\nsolutions is often adopted for dealing with the erosion issues, probably due to the high \n\nenergy conditions of the coast.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 10  \n\n\u2022 Innovative measures  \n\nThese include measures like beach drainage systems. The \u2018\u00c9coplage\u2019 system (applied \n\nin Sables-d\u2019Olonne, France) consists of a gravity drain that lowers the water table \n\nbeneath the beach. As a result, the beach is not saturated with water when waves break \n\non the shore and the infiltration of the water into the sand is improved. The purpose of \n\nthe system is to reduce swash velocities, sediment transport, and therefore erosion. The \n\nwater flows by gravity from the drain to a pumping system. The water is then pumped \n\ninto the sea or is used as (filtered) water in swimming pools or aquariums. The beach \n\ndrainage system seems successful. It does not block the littoral drift like a groyne does. \n\nThe treated beach is stabilized and the untreated beach is continuing to be eroded.  \n\nFigure 1.3 shows a draft scheme of the system installed. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Scheme of the \u2018\u00c9coplage\u2019 system installed in Sables-d\u2019Olonne, France.  \n\n \n\nA completely different type of measure was tried at El M\u00e9dano (beach with dunes) \n\non the Canary Islands (Eurosion, 2004). In 1995 an experiment started which aimed at \n\nrecovering eroded sediments. In this case, it was decided to place small obstacles in a \n\ncompletely bare exposed area. This involved scattering amounts of about 2 m3 of \n\nvolcanic gravel around the eastern slope of Bocinegro mountain. The experiment is \n\nbased on the volcanic gravel\u2019s capacity to retain sand, on which plants germinate, \n\nbeginning the process of soil regeneration and dune formation. The experiment was \n\neffective: the retention and accumulation of sand increased, above all on the smaller \n\nobstacles.  \n\nAnother solution was implemented to protect a sand dune system in Leirosa, south of \n\nFigueira da Foz, in the centre of the Portuguese West Atlantic coast.  \n\nIn mid \u201890\u2019s the construction of an underwater effluent emissary was responsible for \n\nthe disruption of this sand dune system. The use of hard machinery in a fragile area, \n\naggravated by the erosion caused by the breakwater about 1 km north Leirosa, also \n\ncontributed to the destruction of this system.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 11  \n\nThe restoration of the Leirosa sand dunes started in 2000. The dunes were \n\nreconstructed mechanically according to the AIDS (Artificially Inseminated Dune \n\nSystems) method (Reis and Freitas, 2002). This process allowed the damaged dune \n\nsystem to be rebuilt the desired height and slope in a short time. The second part of the \n\nrehabilitation process consisted of increasing the stability that had been achieved by \n\nrevegetation with Ammophila arenaria. This beach grass is widely used all over the \n\nEuropean coast in the rehabilitation of degraded systems due to its unique capacity for \n\nsand stabilization and dune formation.  \n\nIn February 2001, during a storm that affected the whole of the central region of \n\nPortugal, especially on the coast, the ocean front of the Leirosa dune system was \n\ndestroyed in just one night.  \n\nAfter this event it was decided to try another solution, based on the use of \n\ngeotextiles. This material can be as effective as any so called \u201chard engineering \n\nprotection\u201d, with the advantage that it is adaptable to the morphology of the dune \n\nsystem and uses the local available sand (Bleck et al., 2003).  \n\nIn the Leirosa system geotextiles were applied to a dune extension of 120 m along \n\nthe coast. A defense was created on the front bottom of the dune, at the +2.0 level \n\n(hydrographic zero) with sand containers about 6.40 m long, 3.20 m wide and 0.825 m \n\nhigh, in a pyramid arrangement parallel to the coastline (Figure 1.4).  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Installation of the sand containers and first layers of geotextiles in the Leirosa sand dune \nsystem (Antunes do Carmo, January 2006). \n\n \n\nThe protective barrier was constructed to a height of 8 m by several layers of sand \n\nenveloped in geotextiles, in a so called \u201cwrap around technique\u201d, which encapsulates \n\nthe sand and can be installed quickly.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 12  \n\nThis technique allows the absorption of the energy of upcoming wave attacks and \n\nprevents erosion of the fill material through the tensile forces which are activated by this \n\nstress. Furthermore, pore water pressures within the encapsulated sand fill are released \n\nthanks to the good drainage capacity of the geotextile. \n\nThe upper layer used a geotextile revetment throughout the area, about 8.60 m long, \n\n4.30 m wide and 1.10 m high, followed by a 1.0 m layer of sand where dune vegetation \n\nwas planted, turning this area into an attractive and safe coastal dune system (Reis et al., \n\n2005).  \n\nIt is expected that the technique developed to protect the Leirosa sand dunes will \n\nbecome an important model to be used for other dune systems with similar erosion \n\nproblems.  \n\n1.4 NEW CONCEPTS OF COASTAL PROTECTION \n\nVarious coastal structures can be used to solve, or at least, to reduce coastal erosion \n\nproblems. Some of them can provide direct protection, like breakwaters, seawalls and \n\ndikes, and others, such as detached breakwaters and artificial reefs, provide indirect \n\nprotection, reducing the hydraulic load on the coast to the level required to maintain the \n\ndynamic equilibrium of the shoreline. To achieve this objective, these structures are \n\ndesigned to allow the transmission of a certain amount of wave energy over the \n\nstructure by overtopping (and also some transmission through the porous structure, in \n\nsome types of breakwaters), and/or wave breaking and energy dissipation on a shallow \n\ncrest (submerged structures) (Pilarczyk, 2003). \n\nRock walls, breakwaters or groynes usually serve the purpose of protecting land from \n\nerosion and/or enabling safe navigation into harbours and marinas, but other \n\ncommercial value and multi-purpose recreational and amenity enhancement objectives \n\ncan also be incorporated into coastal protection and coastal development projects. \n\nOffshore breakwaters/reefs can be permanently submerged, permanently exposed or \n\ninter-tidal. In each case, the depth of the structure, its size and its position relative to the \n\nshoreline determine the coastal protection level provided by the structure. Submerged \n\nbreakwaters could be an interesting and efficient strategy, not only to protect a coastal \n\nsystem, but also to improve the bathing conditions of some coastal zones. Therefore, \n\nthese so-called multifunctional artificial reefs (MFARs), are one of the new innovative \n\nconcepts for coastal protection. The actual understanding of the functional design of \n\nthese structures may still be insufficient for optimum design but it may be just good \n\nenough for these structures to be considered as serious alternatives for coastal protection \n\n(Pilarczyk, 2003). \n\nThe two main purposes of an MFAR (coastal protection and increasing the surfing \n\npossibilities in a certain area) are explained in greater detail below. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 13  \n\nThe construction of an MFAR can play a part in different kinds of coastal protection, \n\nlike: \n\n\u2022 Preventing coastal erosion; \n\n\u2022 Increasing, in combination or not with sand nourishment, the stability of beaches. \n\nThese sorts of coastal protection are possible because: \n\n\u2022 An MFAR can reduce the wave loads on the coast through a series of wave \n\ntransformation processes occurring on the structure, viz., reflection and energy \n\ndissipation due to waves breaking on the structure and to flow circulation inside \n\nthe porous media;  \n\n\u2022 An MFAR can create current circulation cells behind the reef which can cause \n\nsedimentation at the shoreline; \n\n\u2022 An MFAR can be used to regulate wave action by refraction and diffraction.    \n\n \n\nWith one kind of design, waves can break over an MFAR in such a way that surfers \n\ncan enjoy great sport riding them. Surfing and bodyboarding are growing in popularity, \n\nand are practised especially by young people. Surfing means taking a wave board into \n\nthe sea and waiting for a breaking wave to \u2018ride\u2019 on (Figure 1.5). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.5 - Waiting for and surfing a wave (source: www.surfline.come). \n\n \n\nMulti-functional reefs are in fact a hard measure for tackling coastal problems, and \n\nthey have several advantages over soft measures. The most suitable construction \n\nmaterial for multi-functional artificial reefs is geotextile, used as a sand container. Sand-\n\nfilled geotextile containers are becoming increasingly recognized as a tool for coastal \n\ndefense. Geotextiles are a family of synthetic materials including polyethylene, \n\npolyester and polypropylene. In their common form they are flexible, permeable and \n\ndurable sheet fabrics, resistant to tension and tear. They can be sewn or ultra-sonically \n\nwelded to produce containers designed to retain sand or mortar for use as a construction \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 14  \n\nmaterial. Geotextile containers can be filled and placed using many different methods \n\ndepending on the site location, fill material, container size, available plant, and type of \n\ngeotextile fabric chosen. The advantages are several: \n\n\u2022 Environmental impact \n\nConstruction with geotextile containers allows the use of local materials that would \n\notherwise be unsuitable for coastal construction. In many cases permission can be \n\nobtained to fill the containers with sandy materials taken from the seabed in the \n\nregion of the project site itself. This means that the amount of \u2018foreign\u2019 materials \n\nintroduced to an area is minimized. Unless exposed to high temperatures or pH \n\nlevels, geotextile materials have been shown to be inert in the marine environment.  \n\n\u2022 Durability \n\nModern geotextiles are designed to withstand environmental degradation from \n\nabrasion, UV, chemical and biological influences, and as such a life span of the order \n\nof 25 years can be expected, notwithstanding vandalism or mechanical damage. \n\nUnder accelerated testing, life spans of up to 100 years even in challenging marine \n\nconditions have been postulated. During the construction of the Narrowneck reef \n\nvery effective underwater patching techniques were developed to repair damage that \n\nhad arisen during the construction (Restall et al., 2002). The holes are sealed with a \n\nsilicone based adhesive and a patch is screwed down over the hole, using nylon wall \n\nscrews, to provide added protection. Various coatings were trialed for the crest bags, \n\nwith mixed success. But towards the end of the construction a durable composite \n\n(hybrid) material was developed and tested with great success. Initial trials utilized a \n\nspray-on polyurethane coating of varying thickness, however this product became \n\nrigid once exposed to water and actually made the products more susceptible to \n\nimpact and wave damage. The composite material, consisting of two layers of non-\n\nwoven geotextile, used towards the end of the project allows approximately 4 kg/m2 \n\nof sand and shell particles to be retained within it. Once the geotextile is impregnated \n\nwith these particles its puncture resistance shows significant improvement, while \n\nmarine growth can protect it from UV degradation. \n\n\u2022 Structure is removable \n\nIn the unlikely event that the structure has a previously unforeseen negative impact \n\non the surrounding area, geotextile systems allow the reef to be quickly and easily \n\nremoved. By filling the containers with locally obtained sand, the environmental \n\nimpact of removal would be insignificant as the material released from the reef \n\nwould be the same as or very similar to the natural beach sand. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 15  \n\n\u2022 Provision of marine habitat \n\nMarine ecosystem enhancement is a fourth advantage of the use of geotextile sand \n\ncontainers. These containers have appeared to provide an excellent substrate for \n\nmarine flora and the development of a diverse ecosystem (Borrero and Nelson, 2003, \n\nJackson et al., 2004). Figure 1.6 shows, as an example, short algae and sea grasses on \n\nshallower containers in the Narrowneck reef off the Gold Coast of Australia. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.6 - Short algae and sea grasses on shallower containers of the Narrowneck reef \n\n(Jackson et al, 2004). \n\n \n\nWhen the ecosystem on this reef was well developed, a clear zoning between areas of \n\nsea grass and kelp could be observed. Visually, the macroalgal communities dominated \n\nthe reef, covering over 70% of the reef surface. It was also populated by a variety of \n\nother benthos, including coralline algae, sub-massive sponges, ascidians, octocorals \n\n(soft corals), hydroids and crinoids (feather starfish), echinoids (sea urchin) and \n\nabalone. Observations by the National Marine Science Centre indicated that \u201cthe \n\nbiological communities associated with Narrowneck Artificial Reef appear to enhance \n\nbiodiversity and productivity at a local scale and may also contribute to overall regional \n\nproductivity\u201d (Edwards, 2003).  \n\n\u2022 Soft reef surface \n\nThe use of sand-filled fabric containers maximizes safety on the reef by providing a \n\nrelatively soft structure without sharp edges, reducing the risk of injury should a \n\nsurfer come into contact with the reef. \n\n\u2022 Cost \n\nAs with any construction method, the cost of a reef project is site dependant, as it \n\nrelies on the availability of plant, materials, labour and suitable construction \n\nconditions. However in many situations, especially with large projects, it has been \n\nfound that geotextile solutions can have the cost of the equivalent rock structure \n\n(ASRLtd, 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 16  \n\nHowever, there are also some limitations: \n\n\u2022 Experience of contractors \n\nCoastal engineering contractors around the world are highly experienced in the use \n\nof rock and concrete for coastal construction. Experience in the use of sand-filled \n\ngeotextile systems is less common, although the recent significant growth in the use \n\nof geotextiles for coastal projects worldwide is rapidly improving the skill base. \n\n\u2022 Susceptibility to mechanical damage and vandalism \n\nTesting has shown modern geotextiles to have good puncture and abrasion \n\nresistance; but the resistance of the fabric to mechanical damage and vandalism is \n\nclearly lower than that of rock or concrete. As mentioned before, very effective \n\nunderwater patching techniques were developed to repair damage during the \n\nconstruction of the Narrowneck reef. Notwithstanding this fact, extra care must be \n\ntaken while handling the units during construction, and in some locations it may be \n\nnecessary to introduce measures to safeguard against vandalism.  \n\n\u2022 Lack of design guidance \n\nAt present there are relatively few guidelines available for the design of coastal \n\nstructures using geotextiles. Despite the lack of official design guidance, there has \n\nbeen considerable research in the area of geotextiles and the conclusions of this \n\nresearch along with experience of a wide range of previous projects can be drawn on \n\nto allow successful design.  \n\n \n\nSeveral reasons may account for the growing interest of MFARs over conventional \n\nways of protecting a local coastline: \n\n\u2022 These structures have, by definition, a minimal visual intrusion that especially \n\nenhances their value in zones with strong aesthetic constraints; \n\n\u2022 The structure becomes known better as a way of boosting surfing possibilities as well \n\nas a way to protect the coast;  \n\n\u2022 The water renewal induced by the high level of transmission is desirable to avoid \n\nstagnation and ensure satisfactory quality for recreational waters, especially in \n\ntideless seas, and water oxygenation for animals and plants living in the protected \n\narea leeward of the breakwater; \n\n\u2022 The structure is interesting in economic terms. First, geotextile sand containers tend \n\nto be cheaper per unit volume than rubble-mound structures, and second, the surfing \n\naspect can attract the tourism, which is good for the local economy; \n\n\u2022 The expansion of the environmental value is a great benefit in these times, in which \n\nnature is being destroyed more and more, by the behavior of humans. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 17  \n\n1.5 OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY \n\nThe main objective of this thesis is to define guidelines for an MFAR. In order to \n\nachieve this goal, the research focuses mainly in three activities, which are: \n\n(1) identification and analysis of the influence of key parameters involved in the \n\nfunctionality of an MFAR; \n\n(2) calibration of a numerical model to be used in the study of the MFAR; \n\n(3) definition of the characteristics of the geometry of the MFAR most suitable for the \n\nwest-coast of Portugal based on physical and numerical modelling. \n\nThroughout these activities, studies will be carried out having in view the following \n\nobjectives: \n\n\u2022 The definition of guidelines for multi-functional artificial reefs on theoretical base; \n\n\u2022 The identification of relations between the breaker type, the submergence and the \n\nheight of an MFAR; \n\n\u2022 The calibration of the COULWAVE model (Lynett, 2002) as a reliable tool for the \n\nsimulation of multi-functional artificial reefs; \n\n\u2022 The investigation, using numerical and physical modelling, of the influence of \n\ndifferent design parameters of an artificial surfing reef on the hydrodynamics around \n\nan artificial surfing reef in order to find the optimal design of an MFAR for the coast \n\nof Leirosa in terms of coastal protection and surfability. \n \n\nTo achieve the objectives specified above, the following methodology was adopted. At \n\nfirst an analysis of functionality of a multi-functional artificial reef including the state of \n\nart is done. Secondly a theoretical study to achieve preliminary design guidelines for an \n\nMFAR is conducted. Thirdly physical experiments in a wave flume and numerical \n\nsimulations with COBRAS-UC (Garcia et al. 2004) to investigate the relation between \n\nthe breaker type and the length and the submergence of a submerged artificial reef are \n\ncarried out. In order to be able to use a numerical model to investigate the functionality \n\nof a multi-functional reef, a numerical calibration of the COULWAVE model (Lynett, \n\n2002) is done by comparing results with 3D experimental data of Poort (2007). Finally, \n\nbased on the results found in the methodology followed so far, preliminary numerical \n\nsimulations with the validated model are executed to define the optimal design of an \n\nMFAR for the conditions of the coast in front of Leirosa.  \n\n1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS \n\nThe studies conducted to investigate the functionality of multi-functional artificial \n\nreefs are described in this thesis along seven chapters, distributed in accordance with \n\nwhat follows. \n\nAfter this first chapter, which includes the framework of the thesis and presents the \n\nmain objectives and the methodology adopted in the investigation, chapter 2 describes \n\n\n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n 18  \n\nthe functionality of an MFAR in terms of coastal protection and surfability, together \n\nwith the state of art. Chapter 3 treats design guidelines for an MFAR according to a \n\ntheoretical study. In chapter 4, the physical experiments and numerical simulations with \n\nCOBRAS-UC to investigate the breaker type in relation with the submergence and the \n\nlength of a submerged reef and its results are described. Chapter 5 gives the description \n\nof the mathematical and numerical COULWAVE model and contains also the \n\ncalibration of this model with data from experimental tests in a wave basin done by M. \n\nPoort (2007). In chapter 6, the investigation conducted to obtain the optimal geometry \n\nof the reef for the Leirosa coast with numerical simulations is presented. Results from \n\nthe theoretical study and from the physical and numerical tests constitute the base for \n\nthe geometry to be investigated with the numerical simulations. Chapter 7 contains the \n\nmain conclusions and recommendations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 19  \n\n \n \n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional \nArtificial Reef \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 20  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 21  \n\n2. FUNCTIONALITY OF A MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ARTIFICIAL REEF \n\nThe viability of an MFAR is related to its functionality regarding the two main goals \n\nof the structure: coastal protection and surfing capability. In terms of coastal protection, \n\nit is very important to analyze both the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. \n\nConcerning surf characteristics, there are several parameters to be checked, as described \n\nbelow. \n\nThis chapter presents a description of the functionality of an MFAR, including the \n\nstate of art regarding multi-functional artificial reefs, particularly in what concerns \n\ncoastal protection and surfability. The functionality and the contribution of multi-\n\nfunctional artificial reefs already built and under construction are also described.  \n\n2.1 COASTAL  PROTECTION  \n\n2.1.1 HYDRODYNAMICS IN COASTAL ZONES \n\nMost waves generated in the sea area by storm winds move across the ocean as \n\nswell. Generally, they release their energy along the margins of the continents in the \n\nsurf zone, which is the zone of breaking waves. \n\nAccording to the physical characteristics of the coastal platform responsible for the \n\nwave transformations as they travel cross-shore, wind-generated waves have been \n\ndescribed by several different theoretical developments. In deep waters the small \n\namplitude wave theory, which constitutes the first order of approximation of the Strokes \n\ntheory, performs well. In transitional waters, as the waves become larger, higher orders \n\nof approximation to the Stokes theory can be can be used. Other nonlinear theoretical \n\napproaches should be used in shallow water conditions, like the cnoidal wave theory \n\nderived by Korteweg and De Vries (1895), and others. For very shallow water waves, a \n\nsolitary wave theory developed by Boussinesq (1872), Serre (1953) and others should \n\nbe used. \n\nFigure 2.1, adapted from Kamphuis (2000), shows the applicability of the various \n\nwave theories. The waves are transformed as they travel into shallower water. Once in \n\nshallow waters, a wave undergoes many physical changes before it breaks. The shoaling \n\ndepths interfere with water particle movement at the base of the wave, so the wave \n\nvelocity decreases. As one wave slows, the next waveform, which is still moving at \n\nunrestricted velocity, comes closer to the wave that is being slowed, thus reducing the \n\nwavelength. The energy in the wave, which remains the same, must go somewhere, so \n\nwave height increases. The crests become narrow and pointed, and the troughs become \n\nwide curves. This increase is called shoaling. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 22  \n\n \nFigure 2.1 - Applicability of various wave theories (Kamphuis, 2000). \n\n \n\nThe combination of increasing wave height and decreasing wavelength causes an \n\nincrease in the steepness (H/L) of the waves. In addition, energy is dissipated due to \n\nbottom friction.  \n\nIf sections of a single wave crest are travelling in different water depths, the sections \n\nin deeper water will travel further per unit time, and therefore the wave will change \n\ndirection or refract. Therefore, wave refraction is the gradual reorientation of waves \n\npropagating at an angle to the bottom slope or against a current. Figure 2.2 shows a \n\nrefraction plane for the S. Louren\u00e7o fortification \u2013 Tagus estuary (Portugal) - \n\ncorresponding to a wave 3.0 m high (offshore), a 12 sec period, and direction 225\u00ba \n\n(Antunes do Carmo and Seabra-Santos, 2002). As observed in this figure, refraction \n\npatterns are often interpreted by means of orthogonals, or wave rays. The first are lines \n\ndrawn at right angles to the wave crests, and the second are lines indicating the direction \n\nof energy transmission. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 23  \n\n   \n\n \nFigure 2.2 - Refraction plane for the S. Louren\u00e7o fortification \u2013 Tagus estuary (Portugal) - corresponding \nto a wave 3.0 m high (offshore), 12 s period, and direction 225\u00ba (Antunes do Carmo and Seabra-Santos, \n\n2002). \n\n \n\nIn selected situations, like that presented in Figure 2.3, such as when waves pass a \n\nsmall cape, island or even piers and jetties, diffraction occurs; this is a lateral transfer of \n\nenergy along wave crests. \n\nIncident waves may be reflected from beaches, cliffs, submarine shoals, bars and \n\nridges, jetties, seawalls, etc.  The reflected waves may be of the same dimensions as the \n\nincident waves, and if the wave travels in exactly the opposite direction then a standing \n\nwave can develop. Standing waves are the product of two waves of the same \n\nwavelength moving in opposite directions, resulting in no net movement.

This last is related to the existence of headlands and bays, which \n\ncontrol the energy acting on the beach and produce spatial variations in beach slope, \n\ngrain size and sediment transport rates (Rey et al., 2002). \n\nMost shorefaces and shelves are underlain by relatively thick marine sedimentary \n\nsequences. In general, sediments consisting of sand and gravel occur on the upper and \n\nmiddle shoreface, muds of fluvial origin occur on the shelf, and mixed sands, and muds \n\nare found in the lower shoreface zone (transition zone to shelf) (Van Rijn, 2001). Bed \n\nsediments are generally fining in a seaward direction, supplied by offshore-directed \n\nbottom currents (rip currents and storm-induced currents). \n\nThe fluid in the shoreface zone may be homogeneous (well-mixed) or stratified with \n\na surface layer consisting of relatively low fluid density (fresh warmer water) and a \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 25  \n\nbottom layer of relatively high density (saline colder water). Strong horizontal density-\n\nrelated pressure gradients may occur in regions close to river mouths.  \n\nThe upper shoreface (surf zone) is dominated by wave-driven processes. The surf \n\nzone can be seen as a subsystem of the shoreface zone. The shoreface zone influences \n\nthe surf zone by providing boundary conditions, but the surf zone also affects the \n\nshoreface zone by generating strong rip currents that bring sediments to the shoreface. \n\nFurthermore, the surf zone is a source of free low-frequency energy propagating into the \n\nshoreface zone. The middle and lower shorefaces are affected by tide- and wind-driven \n\ncurrents and by Coriolis effects (Van Rijn, 2001).  \n\nSand can be transported by wind-, wave-, tide- and density-driven currents (current-\n\nrelated transport), or by the oscillatory water motion itself (wave-related transport). The \n\nwaves generally act as a sediment stirring agent, whereas the sediments are transported \n\nby the mean current. Wave-related transport may be caused by the deformation of short \n\nwaves under the influence of decreasing water depth (wave asymmetry). Low-frequency \n\nwaves interacting with short waves may also contribute to the sediment transport \n\nprocess (wave-related transport). \n\nTide- and wind-generated currents with near-bed velocities greater than 0.3 m/s are \n\nable, even at great depths, to move the sediments forming the bed surface. Although \n\noften rather weak, cross-shore currents combined with the stirring action of the waves \n\nare important for the long-term evolution of the shoreface morphology. Big storms are \n\nable to move sediments along the bed surface in water at depths of up to 100 m. Thus, \n\nthe shoreface is an active morphodynamic zone, although the bed evolution processes \n\nmay proceed rather slowly (Van Rijn, 2001).  \n\nWhile alongshore transport is the primary mechanism for changes in beach plan \n\nshape, cross-shore transport is the means by which the beach profile changes. The \n\nresponse time of beaches to variation in cross-shore transport can be as short as one \n\ntidal cycle (during storms) or as long as six months (seasonal variations). Predictions of \n\nbeach response are very important for coastal designers and managers (CIRIA, 1996). \n\nThe variation in the processes across the beach results in characteristic beach \n\nprofiles. The form of the beach profile will then have a feedback role in modifying the \n\nsubsequent shoaling waves. \n\nDunes are created by the accumulation of wind-blown sand transported landward \n\nfrom the backshore and the higher portion of the inter-tidal foreshore. To successfully \n\ntrap and retain this sand, dunes rely on vegetation, especially certain species of grass, \n\nwhich both reduce the wind velocity close to the dune face allowing deposition, and \n\nretain moisture, which increases the threshold of motion of sand grains. Figure 2.4 \n\nshows a healthy dune system on the central part of Portugal\u2019s west coast. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 26  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Healthy dune system on the west central Portuguese coast (Lopes et al., 2003). \n\n \n\nDunes located on the backshore of a sandy beach are important in the development \n\nof the profile of that beach. They act as a reservoir of material which is available during \n\nstorms and, if necessary, enables the beach profile to adjust to a flatter profile, and \n\nabsorb the incoming wave energy (CIRIA, 1996). \n\n2.1.3 SHORELINE RESPONSE ON AN MFAR \n\nKnowledge of the shoreline response on a reef is important for coastal protection \n\npurposes. Not only is the published information available on shoreline response to \n\nMFARs insufficient, but also relatively little is known about shoreline response to \n\nsubmerged structures in general. Ranasinghe et al. (2006a) recently made a compilation \n\nand review of reported field, laboratory and numerical modeling investigations and \n\nconcluded that the key environmental and structural parameters governing shoreline \n\nresponse to submerged structures have not yet been adequately elucidated. The \n\npublished reports of field experiences with submerged prototype structures mentioned \n\nin Ranasinghe et al. (2006a) are summarized in Table 2.1. In brief, it was found that \n\n70% of submerged structures constructed for beach protection to date have resulted in \n\nnet erosion of the shoreline in their lee. It was also concluded that structure length, \n\nstructure crest level, crest width, nearshore slope, littoral drift rates and the presence or \n\nabsence of concurrent sand nourishment do not appear to govern the principal mode of \n\nshoreline response.  \n\nIn an innovative study, Black and Andrews (2001) quantified the shape and \n\ndimensions of salients and tombolos formed in the lee of natural reefs by visually \n\ninspecting aerial photographs of the coastlines of south eastern Australia and New \n\nZealand. By analyzing natural shoreline adjustment, all physical inputs that act to shape \n\nsalients and tombolos over long time scales are brought together. Results suggested that \n\nnatural salients are larger than salients created in the lee of breakwaters and in \n\nlaboratory studies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 27  \n\nTable 2.1 - Features of the sites and the submerged coastal structures reported in the published literature \n(Ranasinghe et al.,  2006a). \n\n \n( B = length of structure, Su = distance from undisturbed shoreline to structure, W = crest width, h = water \ndepth at structure, hc = water depth at crest of the structure, s = bed slope in the vicinity of the structure) \n\n \n\nAnalyses produced non-dimensional ratios, enabling the prediction of limiting \n\nparameters for salient and tombolo formations, determination of salient apex position \n\nwith respect to the type of offshore obstacle (islands or reefs), and the length of \n\nshoreline affected (salient basal width). One of the suggestions emerging from the \n\nanalysis was that, if all other parameters (length of reef/structure, B, distance from \n\nshoreline to reef/structure, S, wave climate, etc.) are equal, a larger salient would \n\ndevelop in the lee of a submerged reef/structure than in the lee of an emergent structure. \n\nHowever, as mentioned by Ranasinghe et al. (2006b), this conclusion is counter-\n\nintuitive because wave sheltering will be greater in the lee of emergent structures, \n\nleading to more favorable conditions for salient growth in their lee. A subsequent \n\nreview of the methodology adopted by Black and Andrews (2001), indicated that the \n\napproach used to assess the critical length scales of natural reefs from aerial \n\nphotographs incorporated several shortcomings (Ranasinghe et al., 2006b). The most \n\nobvious shortcoming of the predictive empirical relationship proposed by Black and \n\nAndrews (2001) is the fact that erosion is not predicted to occur for any combination of \n\nB and S. This is highly questionable in view of the fact that a clear majority of \n\nsubmerged structures installed to date have resulted in (unintended) shoreline erosion \n\n(see Table 2.1). \n\nIn order to gain more insight into the environmental and structural conditions under \n\nwhich shoreline erosion and accretion occur in the lee of submerged structures, and to \n\ns Su (m) \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 28  \n\ngain insight into the nearshore processes governing shoreline erosion and accretion in \n\nthe lee of submerged structures, Ranasinghe et al. (2006b) completed a second study on \n\nthis subject. The shoreline response to submerged structures, such as MFARs, was \n\ninvestigated. The processes governing this response were found to be different from \n\nthose associated with emergent offshore breakwaters. This was indicated by the results \n\nof a series of 2DH numerical and 3D scaled physical modeling tests. Unlike the case of \n\nemergent offshore breakwaters, where shoreline accretion (salient development) is \n\nexpected under all structural/environmental conditions, the principal mode of shoreline \n\nresponse to submerged structures can vary between erosive and accretive, depending on \n\nthe offshore distance to the structure. In the case of the left picture of Figure 2.5 erosion \n\nwas seen, and in the right one accretion.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.5 - Distance apex structure-coast 100 m (left) and distance apex structure coast 250 m (right) \n\n(Ranasinghe et al., 2006b). \n\n \n\nThe predominant wave incidence angle and structure crest level also have important \n\nimplications for the magnitude of shoreline response, but not for the mode of shoreline \n\nresponse (i.e. erosion vs. accretion). With the geometry and the wave conditions tested \n\nby Ranasinghe and Turner (2006b) the most significant feature in the structure-induced \n\nnearshore circulation patterns under shore normal wave incidence is the \u2018switch\u2019 from a \n\nsymmetric 2-cell circulation system to a symmetric 4-cell circulation system, as the \n\nstructure is moved offshore (Figure 2.5). Based on the results obtained in their study, a \n\npredictive empirical relationship was proposed as a preliminary engineering tool to \n\nassess shoreline response to submerged structures. This relationship is Sa/SZW > 1.5, \n\nwhere Sa is the distance between the apex of the structure and the undisturbed shoreline \n\nand SZW is the natural surf zone width.  \n\nBroad-crested nearshore structures are a relatively new field of research, and a \n\n'standardized' method to describe their geometry has not yet been established in the \n\nliterature.  For more conventional shore-parallel rubble-mound structures it is probably \n\n \nb) \n\nshoreline \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 29  \n\nmost usual to define the characteristic length of 'S' as the distance from the shoreline to \n\nthe centre-line of the crest. For the broad-crested structures Ranasinghe et al. (2006b) \n\nmodeled, the distance to the apex of the crest (Sa) was chosen as the characteristic \n\nlength (Figure 2.6). \n\n \n\nOffshore direction \nbeach \n\nSa \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Characteristic length broad-crested breakwaters. \n\n \n\nMuch research has been done on currents and waves breaking on and around natural \n\nreefs. However, the topography of natural reefs is highly variable, some fringing reefs \n\n(reefs which front a continental land mass or island) may have quite flat seaward slopes, \n\nfor example 1:15, whereas platform reefs (reefs located in open ocean) on the \n\noutersections may have very steep seaward slopes, for example 1:2 or steeper (Gourlay, \n\n1993). No publications have been found that deal with the relation between the \n\ntopography of the reef and the influence on hydrodynamics in general regarding the \n\ncoastal protection behavior of such natural reefs.  \n\nIn 2005 the DELOS project finished. The overall objective of this project was to \n\npromote the effective and environmentally compatible design of low crested structures \n\n(LCSs) to protect European shores against erosion and to preserve the littoral \n\nenvironment and the economic development of the coast. Much experimental and \n\nnumerical research has been undertaken in this project. In all the experimental studies \n\nthe LCS were small-crested and designed with a relatively steep slope. This means that \n\nthe results are not useful for research into the coastal protection aspect of MFARs. \n\nFurthermore, no tests were conducted to investigate current velocity in the lee of an \n\nLCS in a basin. The focus of the basin tests was stability, hydrodynamics near the \n\nstructure and wave transmission.  \n\nIn order to get an idea of the shoreline response on an MFAR, and taking into \n\naccount all the research described above, the mean current field can be used \n\n(Ranasinghe and Turner, 2006b). The numerical model results (current analysis) and the \n\nprototype field results (morphodynamic analysis) reported by these researchers showed \n\nthat:  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 30  \n\n(a) under shore normal wave incidence, the mode of shoreline response to submerged \n\nstructures is governed by the structure-induced nearshore circulation; and  \n\n(b) under oblique wave incidence, the mode of shoreline response is governed by the \n\ninteraction between the ambient longshore current and the structure-induced \n\nnearshore circulation pattern. \n\n This means that the currents (the ambient longshore and the structure-induced \n\nnearshore circulation pattern) can be used as an indication of the shoreline response. \n\nEssentially, erosion occurs when the resultant current field contains divergent \n\nalongshore currents at the shoreline in the lee of the structure. Conversely, shoreline \n\naccretion occurs when convergent alongshore currents are generated at the shoreline in \n\nthe lee of the structure.   \n\nThe hydrodynamic processes that govern the development of nearshore circulation \n\npatterns around relatively simple delta-form MFARs are explained in Ranasinghe and \n\nTurner (2006b) and are partially presented in this section. For reasons of simplicity, just \n\nshore normal waves are considered (i.e. no ambient longshore current due to oblique \n\nwave incidence at the shoreline). References to \u2018longshore flow/transport\u2019 in this section \n\nrefer only to structure-induced alongshore flows/currents. \n\nIn the two-dimensional case of a submerged structure, such as the case of a \n\nsubmerged reef, longshore flow driven by an alongshore pressure gradient occurs \n\nbehind the structure to satisfy continuity constraints. The total transport capacity of the \n\nlongshore flow is determined by the longshore pressure gradient and the cross-sectional \n\narea of the longshore flow.  \n\nFigure 2.7 shows the cross-shore profile of surface elevation, wave height, and initial \n\nbed level at the two cross-sections presented in Figure 2.5 (left) and here when the \n\nstructure is close to shore (apex at 100 m from the shore).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 31  \n\n                                                  \n \n\nFigure 2.7 - Wave height and surface elevation along different cross-sections for apex structure-coast \ndistance 100 m (left, Ranasinghe et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nOne section is across the apex of the structure (Section A) while the other is along \n\nthe plane bed away from the structure (Section B). Along Section A, the wave height \n\ndecreases through the surf zone and over the top of the structure producing a higher \n\nsurface elevation than at Section B. This alongshore gradient in surface elevation drives \n\nlongshore flows away from the structure in both longshore directions in the lee of the \n\nstructure. However, in this case, the small gap between the structure and the shoreline \n\nand the resulting relatively shallow trough region between the structure and the \n\nshoreline constrains the capacity for onshore flow over the structure. Therefore, the \n\nlongshore flow in the lee of the structure is largely due to the alongshore surface \n\nelevation gradients resulting from alongshore gradients in the wave setup in the lee of \n\nthe structure. However, because of the complex plane shape of the artificial surfing reef \n\nstructure investigated here, currents are also generated along the two sides of the \n\nstructure due to waves breaking obliquely on the sides of the structure. These \u2018along-\n\nstructure\u2019 currents also contribute to the onshore flow over the structure and the \n\nalongshore flows in the lee of the structure. The resulting nearshore circulation pattern \n\nconsists of two cells, symmetric about Section A, with divergent flow at the shoreline in \n\nthe lee of the structure.  \n\nFigure 2.8 shows the cross-shore profile of surface elevation, wave height, and initial \n\nbed level at the two cross-sections when the structure is farther away from the shore \n\n(apex at 250 m from the shore).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 32  \n\n                                             \n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Wave height and surface elevation along different cross-sections for the case of distance apex \nstructure-coast 250 m (left, Ranasinghe et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nAgain, one section is across the apex of the structure (Section A) while the other is \n\nalong the plane bed away from the structure (Section B). In this case, the longshore flow \n\nis less constrained by the topography, thereby allowing larger cross-shore flow over the \n\nstructure. In contrast to the previous case, here wave setup occurs through the surf zone \n\non the structure, reaching a local maximum at the top of the structure slope, and \n\ndecreases towards mean sea level over the flat top of the structure. Through the surf \n\nzone, part of the radiation stress gradient drives the onshore flow over the structure and \n\nthe setup is reduced relative to the zero-onshore flow case (i.e. adjacent plane bed case). \n\nA small amount of wave dissipation occurs across the top of the structure which, \n\ntogether with the hydrostatic pressure gradient due to setup, maintains the onshore flow \n\nover the structure. A small positive set-up remains at the back of the structure providing \n\nthe longshore pressure gradient to drive the longshore flow (directed away from the \n\nstructure), with the maximum longshore transport occurring in the deepest water \n\nimmediately behind the structure. As in the previous case, the \u2018along-structure\u2019 currents \n\ndue to oblique wave breaking on the structure contribute to the onshore flow over the \n\nstructure and to the alongshore flows in the lee of the structure. However, in contrast to \n\nthe previous case the substantial distance between the back wall of the structure and the \n\nshoreline (i.e. 200 m) allows the waves to re-form to some extent in the lee of the \n\nstructure. Therefore, wave setup occurs again at the shoreline in the lee of the structure \n\nwhen the re-formed waves break at the shoreline. However, the reformed wave height in \n\nthe lee of the structure (section A) is lower than the height of the previously unbroken \n\nwaves at the plane bed away from the structure (section B). Therefore, the wave setup at \n\nthe shoreline in the lee of the structure is lower than that along the shoreline adjacent to \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 33  \n\nthe structure. This longshore gradient in the setup at the shoreline results in a longshore \n\ngradient of surface elevation which drives alongshore currents towards the lee area, \n\nwhere they converge before turning offshore, owing to mass conservation requirements. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the resulting nearshore circulation pattern consists of four cells, \n\nsymmetric about Section A, with convergent flow at the shoreline in the lee of the \n\nstructure. \n\nMore complex geometries (for example the presence of a platform) are however \n\nmore difficult to explain with the theories set forth in the above paragraphs.  \n\n2.2 SURFABILITY \n\nBesides coastal protection, the creation of surfing conditions is an important aspect \n\nof an MFAR. This section gives a systematic explanation of the key surfing parameters \n\nused in the design of an MFAR, viz., the peel angle, the type of breaker, the wave \n\nheight and the currents. However, due to the importance of waves for surfing, the \n\nphenomena of free waves are elucidated first. After the explanation of the key surfing \n\nparameters, the state of the art of MFARs will be described. \n\n2.2.1 FREE SURFACE WAVES \n\nWaves form when the water surface is disturbed, by wind, earthquakes or planetary \n\ngravitational forces, for instance. Thus, we can identify at sea waves that have very \n\nshort wave periods (order of 0.10 seconds, known as capillary waves) to tides, tsunamis \n\nand seiches (basin oscillations), where the wave periods are expressed in minutes or \n\nhours. Wind waves, which account for most of the total available wave energy, have \n\nperiods from 1 to 30 seconds and wave heights that are seldom greater than 10 m and \n\nmostly of the order of 1 m, particularly in deep water conditions. As can be seen in \n\nFigure 2.9, most of the energy possessed by ocean waves is in wind-generated waves \n\n(Thurman and Trujillo, 1999). During such disturbances energy and momentum are \n\ntransferred to the water mass and transmitted in the direction of the impelling force. A \n\nproportion of the wave energy is dispersed by radial, inertial and convective means, but \n\na large amount is not lost until waves encounter shallow coastal waters. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 34  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Distribution of energy in ocean waves (Thurman and Trujillo, 1999). \n\n \n\nWind waves can originate near the shore or offshore. In case of offshore generated \n\nwaves, storms and depressions cause strong winds to blow over a stretch of ocean \n\nsurface (fetch) for a certain amount of time. Wind energy is transformed into wave \n\nenergy by the creation of high frequency waves known as choppy waves. The energy \n\nfrom the higher-frequency waves (lower periods) is in turn transferred to lower-\n\nfrequency waves (longer periods): the so called swell waves. The swell waves travel \nfaster than higher-frequency waves (speed of waves in deep water is ( )?2 Tg ) and \nconsequently the swell waves will separate from the higher frequency waves as the \n\nwave field propagates away from the region of generation. The higher-frequency waves \n\nof distant storms have dissipated most of their energy before they reach the coast, and \n\nso the wave field gets cleaned up. The swell waves with the longest wave periods can \n\ntravel thousands of kilometres. The swell energy is distributed over a relatively narrow \n\nrange of frequencies resulting in a slowly modulated wave field. Therefore, swell waves \n\nalways arrive in sets. The periods of swell waves vary in general between 8 and 16 \n\nseconds. Local waves are formed by local winds, which cause the wave climate to be \n\nirregular and the waves to have short wave periods (in general between 4 and 7 \n\nseconds). \n\nAs mentioned, waves with lower frequency (longer wavelengths) travel faster, and thus \n\nleave the sea area first. The same is true for wave groups. Waves travel in wave groups. \n\nFigure 2.10 shows such a wave group in which L is the wavelength, Lg is the wave-\n\ngroup length, c is the wave celerity and cg is the wave group celerity. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 35  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.10 - Wave group (Freds\u00f8e and Deigaard, 1995). \n\n \n\nThe difference in speed of the single waves is the cause for the principle of wave \n\ndispersion, which is a sorting of waves by their wavelength. As a group of waves leaves \n\na sea area and becomes a swell wave train, the group moves across the ocean surface at \n\nonly half the velocity of an individual wave in the group. Progressively, the leading \n\nwave disappears. However, there is always the same number of waves in the group. As \n\nthe leading wave disappears, a new wave replaces it at the back of the group. Most \n\nwaves generated in the sea area by storm winds move across the ocean as swell. \n\nGenerally, they release their energy along the margins of the continents in the surf zone, \n\nwhich is the zone of breaking waves. \n\n2.2.2 PEEL ANGLE \n\nSurfable waves never break all at once along the wave crest. If this does happen, the \n\nwaves are closing-out and not suitable for surfing purposes. In order for a wave to be \n\nsurfable, the wave has to break gradually (read peel) along the wave crest. The velocity \n\nwith which this happens is called the \u2018peel rate\u2019 Vp of the wave (Figure 2.11).  \n\nThe peel angle is one of the most important surfability parameters (? in Figure 2.11). \n\nThe peel angle is the angle enclosed by the wave crest and the breaker line (Walker, \n\n1974). Two other vectors that are shown in Figure 2.11 are c\nr\n\n and SV\nr\n\n. c\nr\n\n is the wave \n\ncelerity and SV\nr\n\n (called down-line velocity) is the absolute value of the vector sum of the \n\nvelocities c\nr\n\n and pV\nr\n\n, it is the actual velocity experienced by the surfer. From Figure \n\n2.11 it can be seen that another way to see the peel angle is as the angle enclosed by the \n\nvelocity vectors of the peel rate pV\nr\n\n and the down-line velocity SV\nr\n\n (Henriquez, 2004).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 36  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.11 - Illustration of wave celerity vector c\nr\n\n, peel rate pV\nr\n\n, down line velocity sV\nr\n\n and peel angle ? \n\n(Source:surfermag.com). \n\n \n\nIn Figure 2.12 it can also be seen that the peel angle in fact is equal to the wave angle \n\n?  between the normal on the bathymetry and the wave ray (the conventionally called  \n\u2018wave angle\u2019) if the breaker line is parallel to the bathymetry.

The relation between the peel \n\nangle, ?, and the angle ? (Figure 2.12) is represented by the graph presented in Figure \n2.14. The results shown in this figure are for a 10 s period and a wave height, in deep \n\nwater conditions, of 1.5 m. The calculations are done for waves travelling over a shelf \n\nbefore reaching the reef (Figure 2.15). However, because linear shoaling is assumed, the \n\nresults are the same for a wave travelling over a sloping bottom before reaching the reef \n\n(Figure 2.16). \n \n\n4 \n\n7 \n\n10 \n\nh\n\n0.68 \n\n0.56 \n\n0.41 \n\nkhs \n\n      Wave angle ?s \n\n Peel  \nangle  \n    ? \n\n \nFigure 2.14  - Peel angle ? as a function of the reef angle ?s and the shelf depth khs or hs for T = 10 s and \n\nH0 = 1.5 m. \n\n \n \n\nbeach \n\nREEF \n\ndeep water \n?s \n\nshelf \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.15 - Peel angle with shelf. \n \n\n \n\nbeach \n\nREEF \n\nshelf at one point \n\n? \n\ndeep water \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16 - Peel angle without shelf. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 39  \n\nNot only does the peel angle have a maximum, but it is clear from Figure 2.14 that it \n\nhas an exponential growth for the same wave angle ?s when the reef starts in shallower \n\nwater. The physical explanations of these two phenomena are described below. \n\n \n\nHow can the peel angle have a maximum? \n\nWhen calculating the parameters like wave height, water depth and peel angle at the \n\nbreaking point, with linear theory, it appears that the larger the wave angle in deep \n\nwater, the less the water depth at the breaking point. Figure 2.17 shows this \n\nphenomenon for different wave angles in deep water. In this figure, the angle of \n\nincidence in deep water, ?0, can be seen as the angle ? in Figure 2.12 and the wave \n\nangle in the third column in this figure, at the breaker line position, can be seen as the \n\npeel angle ? in Figure 2.12. The second \u2018column\u2019 in Figure 2.17 are the values of the \n\nwave angles at the line of the breaker line for the angle on deep water of 45 degrees \n\n(wave conditions are: a period of 10 seconds and a wave height of 1.5 m in deep water \n\nconditions).  \n\nFrom this, it can be seen that the wave angle grows at the same water depth when the \n\nwave angle on deep water grows (law of Snellius). \n\n \n \n\n = Breaker line  \n\n????0=75\u00b0 \n\n????0=45\u00b0 \n\n????0=66\u00b0 \n\n11.7\u00b0 \n\n13.2\u00b0 \n\n13.7\u00b0 \n\n15.3\u00b0 \n\n16.1\u00b0 \nBEACH \n\n11.7\u00b0 \n\nDeep water \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.17 \u2013 Wave breaking more shorewards for larger wave angle at deep water. \n\n \n\nThe fact that the wave travels more shoreward, for a larger wave angle on deep water, \n\nhas to be caused by a stronger decline in the wave height so that the wave can travel on \n\nlonger before it breaks. For that reason the development of the wave height along the \n\nwave ray is investigated. Two processes influence the wave height when a wave travels \n\ntowards the coast, and these are shoaling and refraction. The variation in the wave \n\nheight for different water depths is given by Equation 2.1. \n\n \n\nrs KKHH \u00d7\u00d7= 12         (2.1) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 40  \n\nwhere \n2\n\n1\n\ng\n\ng\ns\n\nc\n\nc\nK =  is the shoaling factor and \n\n2\n\n1\n\ncos\n\ncos\n\n?\n?\n\n=rK  is the refraction factor. The \n\nwave travels from the location of wave height H1 towards the location of wave height \n\nH2. Shoaling is independent of the wave angle on deep water; refraction, however, is \n\ndependent on that angle. Figure 2.18 shows the factor Ks*Kr when the wave travels \n\nfrom deep to shallow water conditions for angles on deep water of 45 degrees and 75 \n\ndegrees, considering the same wave conditions shown in Figure 2.14. Figure 2.19 shows \n\nthe consequence for the wave height of what is demonstrated in Figure 2.16. \n\n \n\nWater depth (m) \n\nKs*Kr \n?0=45\u00b0 \n\n ?0=75\u00b0 \n\n \nFigure 2.18 - Multiplied factor of the shoaling and refraction factor. \n\n \n\n \n\nWater depth (m) \n\n?0=45\u00b0 \n ?0=75\u00b0  \n\nWave \nheight       \n\n(m) \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.19 - Wave height as a function of the shoaling and refraction factor. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.19 shows that, for the same water depth, the wave height decreases when \n\nthe wave angle on deep water increases. Because of this decrease, the wave can travel \n\nfurther towards the coastline before the breaking condition Hb = 0.78*h is met. As a \n\nconsequence of the law of Snellius, it can be continued longer and the wave angle can \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 41  \n\ncontinue to diminish. The maximum peel angle occurs with an angle on deep water of \n\n66 degrees no matter what the wave conditions. So, at an angle of 66 degrees the \n\ndecrease of the peel angle by the effect of a longer continuation of refraction (law of \n\nSnellius) is larger than the increase of the peel angle through the effect of a larger wave \n\nangle on deep water.  \n\n \n\nWhy is there exponential growth of the peel angle for the same wave angle ?s when \n\nthe reef starts in shallower water? \n\nAnother aspect of the peel angle is that it experiences exponential growth with \n\ndecreasing depth of the start of the reef, for the same wave angle ?s, as can be seen in \n\nFigure 2.14. The only process by which the wave angle changes along the wave ray \n\nwhen a wave travels from deep water towards the shoreline is refraction. The influence \n\nof refraction on the wave angle is given by Snellius\u2019 law (Equation 2.2). \n\n \n\n 0=?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\nc\n\nsin\n\ndx\n\nd\n (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere dx is in the direction of the wave ray, ? is the wave angle between the wave ray \n\nand the normal to the bathymetry and c is the wave velocity. Equation 2.2 can be re-\n\nwritten as:  \n\n \n( )\n( )1\n\n2\n12\n\n \n\n \n  ; \n\nkhtanh\n\nkhtanh\nAsinAsin =?=?    (2.3) \n\n \n\nwhere k is the wave number, and the water depth h1 is greater than the water depth h2.  \n\n \n\nThe difference in the water depth from point 1 to point 2, ?h = h1 \u2013 h2, is assumed to be \n\nthe same for all water depths. In fact, the value of A in Equation 2.3 gives information \n\nabout the magnitude of refraction; its value is plotted in Figure 2.20 for different water \n\ndepths. The period in these calculations is 10 s. It can be seen in Figure 2.20 that \n\nrefraction for the same ?h is relatively greater in shallower water. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 42  \n\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nh (m)\n\nA\n\n \nFigure 2.20 - Relative refraction. \n\nIn order to show this effect on the exponential growth of the peel angle with \n\ndecreasing depth, two cases are assumed (Figure 2.21): \n\n\u2022 Case 1: two reefs in relatively deep water, starting with a difference of ?h in water \n\ndepth; \n\n\u2022 Case 2: two reefs in relatively shallow water, starting with a difference of ?h in \n\nwater depth. \n\n \n \n\nReef 2 \n\nCase 1 Case 2 \n\n?h \n\n?h Reef 1 \n\nReef 1 Reef 2 \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.21 - Two cases of reefs starting at different depths. \n\n \n\nIn Case 2, the loss in total refraction of the wave from ? to the wave angle ? between \nthe two reefs is larger than in Case 1. Figure 2.22 shows ? for the deeper start of the reef \nin Cases 1 and 2, where ?x is the horizontal distance for the vertical distance ?h. This \n\nlarger value of loss of refraction in case 2 means that the wave at the breaking point has \n\nrefracted relatively less in Case 2 than in Case 1 [even though the initial refraction is \n\nhigher (Figure 2.20)], leading to a stronger growth of the peel angle. This effect appears \n\nat every water depth and it is the reason that the peel angle experiences an exponential \n\ngrowth with decreasing depth, for the same wave angle ?. So it can be said that the peel \n\nangle grows exponentially for a lower start of the reef depth with the same angle ? \n\nbecause refraction is exponentially greater in shallow water. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 43  \n\n \n \n\nWave ray (case 1) \nWave ray (case 2) \n\n? x  \n\n? \n\nNormal on reef \nbathymetry \n\n????1111    \n????2222    \n\nOffshore \ndirection \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.22 - Different loss in refraction for the two cases of Figure 2.21. \n \n\n2.2.3 BREAKER TYPE \n\nThe shape of a breaking wave is of great importance for surfing. Battjes (1974) used \n\nthe surf-similarity parameter, ?0 (equation (2.4)), to describe the breaker type on single \n\nslopes: \n\n \n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nL\n\nH\n\ns\n=?         (2.4) \n\n \n\nwhere ?0 is the offshore Iribarren number, s is the bottom slope, H0 is the offshore wave \n\nheight and L0 is the deep water wave length. The value of the Iribarren number \n\ncorresponds with every regime as in  \n\n \n\nTable 2.3. \n \n \n\nTable 2.3 - Breaker type transition values for the offshore Iribarren number. \n \n\nRegime Range \n\nSurging/collapsing 0?  > 3.3 \n\nPlunging 0.5 > b?  > 3.3 \n\nSpilling b?  &lt;0.5 \n\n \n\nBesides the offshore Iribarren number, also the inshore Iribarren number, ?b, has \n\nbeen defined. In the inshore Iribarren parameter the offshore wave height, H0, has been \n\nreplaced by the breaker wave height, Hb. All other parameters are equal. In principle, \n\ntransition values and other wave breaking-related quantities described should be better \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 44  \n\npredicted in terms of the inshore parameter than the surf-similarity parameter, since the \n\ninshore parameter involves the measured breaking wave height rather than the deep-\n\nwater wave height. However, correlations with measurements using the inshore \n\nparameter showed no superiority (Smith and Kraus, 1990). The categorization of the \n\ndifferent breaker type regimes of the inshore Iribarren number is presented in Table 2.4. \n \n\nTable 2.4 - Breaker type transition values for inshore Iribarren number. \n\nRegime Range \n\nSurging/collapsing b?  > 2.0 \n\nPlunging 0.4 > b?  > 2.0 \n\nSpilling b?  > 0.4 \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that these results are based on experiments on plane slopes where \n\nthe angle of incidence of the waves was zero. The slope is the slope that the wave \n\nexperiences, so is along the path of the wave and not along the normal on the reef \n\ncontours (Figure 2.23). \n\n \n \n\nNormal on the reef contours \ncontours\n\nCrest \ndelta \n\n \n\nPath of the wave \n\nOffshore \ndirection \n\n \nFigure 2.23 - Path of the wave compared to the normal on the depth contours. \n\n \n\nThe main breaking types are described as follows [the technical part of terminology \n\nis from Galvin (1968), the relation between the breaker types and the Irribaren number \n\nfrom Battjes (1974), and the surfer interpretation from Henriquez (2004)]. \n\n \n\n1. Spilling breakers  \n\nThese breaking waves occur if the wave crest becomes unstable and flows down \n\nthe front face of the wave producing a foamy water surface \u2013 surfers would say a \n\n\u2018soft\u2019 or \u2018weak\u2019 wave. This regime is considered surfable. Spilling waves are \n\nshown in Figure 2.24.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 45  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.24 - Spilling waves, b?  = 0.2 (Battjes, 1974). \n \n\n2. Plunging breakers  \n\nThese breaking waves occur if the crest curls over the front face and falls into the \n\nbase of the wave, resulting in a high splash - surfers call this a \u2018tubing\u2019 wave. This \n\nregime is preferred by most surfers, and a more spilling plunging wave is preferred \n\nover a more collapsing plunging wave. Plunging waves are shown in Figure 2.25 \n\nand Figure 2.26 . \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.25 - Plunging waves b?  = 1.5 (Battjes, 1974). \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.26 - Plunging waves, b?  = 0.5 (Battjes, 1974). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 46  \n\n3. Collapsing breakers  \n\nThese breaking waves occur if the crest remains unbroken and the front face of the \n\nwave steepens and then falls, producing an irregular turbulent water surface - \n\nsurfers often encounter this regime at reef breaks when the tide is too low and the \n\nreef is not submerged enough to produce surfable waves, and so it is an unsurfable \n\nregime. Collapsing breaking waves are shown in Figure 2.27. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.27 - Collapsing waves, b?  = 3 (Battjes, 1974). \n \n\n4. Surging breakers  \n\nThese breaking waves occur if the crest remains unbroken and the front face of the \n\nwave advances up the beach with minor breaking. This regime is also unsurfable. \n\nSurging breaking waves are shown in Figure 2.28. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.28 - Surging waves, b?  = 5 (Battjes, 1974). \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that the breaker types mentioned above will only develop as the \n\nIribarren number describes (according to the bottom slope and wave steepness) when \n\nthe wave experiences the relevant conditions during enough length of the slope. So a \n\nwave that should in principle be plunging when it breaks on an MFAR, according to \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 47  \n\nEquation 2.4, will be more spilling when it breaks if the slope of the reef is relatively \n\ntoo short to reach the Iribarren number for the relevant bottom slope and wave \n\nsteepness. In other terms, the wave breaks to some extent according to the bottom slope \n\nand not just according to the reef slope (Figure 2.29). \n \n\n \nFigure 2.29 \u2013 Breaker type. \n\n \n\nThe breaker type is an important parameter in the scope of multi-dimensional \n\nartificial reefs. Besides the indication of the energy dissipation it is also an important \n\nparameter for the wave shape. It is critical to have a highly-refined definition of the \n\nwave breaking intensity and to define the actual shape of the plunging wave profiles, \n\nsince this type of breaking is preferred by most surfers. Mead and Black (2001a) related \n\nwave vortex parameters to seabed slopes at a wide selection of world-class surfing \n\nbreaks and they have developed a linear equation to predict the vortex length to width \n\nratio. However they didn\u2019t take into account the wave height and period in their study. \n\nHenriquez (2004) found, in an experimental study in a wave basin, that the depth of the \n\nreef crest significantly affects the shape of a breaking wave and that this should be \n\nstudied by conducting more laboratory experiments. \n\nThe conventional method to predict the wave breaking intensity, namely the Iribarren \n\nnumber, was defined for a beach with a constant slope, which is not the case for a wave \n\nbreaking in an MFAR. The categorization of breaker types defined by Battjes (1974) \n\nwas based on the Iribarren number on a single, long slope. However, in case of a \n\nbreakwater the influence of its submergence and the length of the slope on the breaking \n\nprocess is not clear. Even though the Iribarren number could not be the best method to \n\npredict breaking waves for surfing, it still is the most appropriate method.  \n\nRegarding the breaking behavior on and velocities around artificial reefs with a \n\nsmooth slope, just one study has been conducted in a wave flume by Corbett and \n\nTomlinson (2002). They performed a physical study for Noosa Main Beach in Australia \n\nto investigate the wave breaking behavior and associated safety issues for an artificial \n\nreef. The analysis of the results of these tests was especially focused on the breaker \n\ntype, the breaker wave height and the breaker location as an indication for the safety of \n\nthe submerged reef. However, no surface elevation and velocity measurements were \n\nextensively made. Besides that, even though several submergences were tested, no \n\nanalysis of the relation between the submergence and the Iribarren number were made. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 48  \n\nFurthermore, the influence of the length of the slope on the Iribarren number was not \n\ninvestigated.  \n\nHenriquez (2004), Van Ettinger (2005), Over (2006), Trung (2006) and Poort (2007) \n\ninvestigated the breaking behavior on and currents around an artificial reef in a wave \n\nbasin. However, in these experiments the influence of the length of the slope and the \n\nsubmergence of the reef on the wave shape was not investigated. Several other \n\nexperimental studies have been conducted in wave basins for projects of artificial reefs \n\nas for the Narrowneck reef of which the construction was finished in 2000 and the \n\nDubai reef of which the construction has not started yet. However, the data from design \n\nstudies are often confidential and not available for science purposes. \n\n2.2.4 WAVE HEIGHTS \n\nBy now every possible wave has been surfed. Surfers that surf on a long board are \n\nstill surfing when waves are 0.15 m high, whereas those that are towed into waves ride \n\nthe biggest waves they can find, up to 20 m. On the whole, waves between 0.5 m and 10 \n\nm are considered surfable (Henriquez, 2004). However, in order to study the viability of \n\nan MFAR, wave heights between 1m and 3 m are the most common values, and are \n\nadjusted according to the target level of surfers for which the MFAR are being \n\ndesigned. \n\n2.2.5 CURRENTS \n\nCurrents around a surf break are of vital importance when considering the surfability \n\nof the break. There could be waves in perfect surfing condition but yet unreachable due \n\nto strong currents. Usually these cases are rare but it is not ideal to have to be constantly \n\npaddling to keep positioning. \n\nRip currents can destroy good surfable waves. Rip currents are narrow strong currents \n\nthat move seaward through the surf zone (Bowen, 1969). When the rip-current flows \n\nthrough the breaker zone the wave seems to get a rough surface and breaks in a \n\nhesitating manner making the waves unsuitable for surfing. Rip-currents can also be \n\nadvantageous; the surfer can use the rip-current to get outside the breaker zone more \n\neasily (Henriquez, 2004). \n\n2.2.6 WAVE FOCUSING \n\nWave focusing, like refraction, is another physical process that has a large influence \n\non surfing as it has a large influence on the peel angle. In the study of Mead and Black \n\n(2001b) wave focusing is recognized as an important aspect in the design of an MFAR. \n\nBesides increasing the wave height and refraction, it has an effect on the peel angle. \n\nHowever, this contribution of the different processes of refraction and wave focusing on \n\nthe peel angle along the breaker line has not yet been described. It will be threatened in \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 49  \n\nthis section. If wave focusing occurs, the wave rays converge, leading to an increase in \n\nwave height and consequently to its earlier breaking. This causes the breaker line to be \n\nnearer the intersection of the reef and the sea bottom than if there was no wave \n\nfocusing, leading to less refraction and thus a higher value of the peel angle.  \n\nThe influence of wave focusing on the breaker line is part of this thesis and is here \n\npresented more deeply. The breaker line in Figure 2.30 and Figure 2.32 and the graph in  \n\nFigure 2.31can be divided into three parts: part A, where wave focusing occurs; part \n\nB, where wave defocusing occurs, and part C, where there is neither wave focusing nor \n\ndefocusing (?2 and ?3 are zero, Figure 2.31). \n\nWhen wave focusing occurs, the value of the peel angle can be divided into several \n\ncontributions: \n\n\u2022 ?1 is the angle ? minus the decrease due to refraction on the reef slope (Figure 2.31 \n\nand Figure 2.33); \n\n\u2022 ?2 is the difference between the angles for the cases with and without wave focusing, \n\ndue to less refraction by earlier breaking (see ?2 in Figure 2.31, ?2 = ?4 \u2013 ?1 inFigure \n\n2.33); \n\n\u2022 ?3 is the angle due to deviation of the breaker line from the parallel to the bathymetry \n\nof the reef side (Figure 2.31 and Figure 2.34). \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\nBreaker line \n\nReef tip  \n\nPart A \n\nPart B \n\nPart C Offshore direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.30 - Breaker line (Henriquez, 2004).    \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 50  \n\n \n\nPeel angle inclusive contribution of wave focusing \n \nPeel angle without contribution of deviation of the breaker line due to wave (de-)focusing \n \nContribution peel angle due to deviation of the breakerline due to wave (de-)focusing \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n?2 \n\n?3 \n \n\n?1 \n\nA \n\nB \nLess \nrefraction/More \nfocusing \n\nMore \nrefraction/Less \nfocusing \n\nC \n\n?1 \n \n\n?2 \n ?3 \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.31 - Contributions to the peel angle along the breaker line (basic Figure: Henriquez, 2004) \n\n \n\n  \n\n ?3 = 0\u00b0 \n\nMinimum of ?1+?2  \n\nPart A \n\nPart B \n\nPart C \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.32 - Enlargement of part of the breaker line; schematic positions of certain values of the peel \nangle. \n\n \n \n\n? \n\n?1 \n\n?4 \n\nwave ray \n\nwave ray \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \nFigure 2.33 - Angles ?1 and ?4.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 51  \n\n \n\n?3 \n?3 = 0\u00b0 \n\nbreaker line \n\nwave \nray \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.34 - Angle ?3. \n \n\nThe transition from wave focusing to wave defocusing occurs at the minimum of \n\nangle ?1+?2 on the right side of part A. This can be concluded because at that point the \n\npeel angle is equal to ?1, which is the value for the peel angle without no wave focusing. \n\nThe peel angle ?1 is different for the areas A and B. In area A, ?1 is the minimum \n\nvalue of ?1+?2, corresponding to a peel angle value when no wave defocusing (after the \n\nwave focusing) would occur. For large values of s, the peel angle tends to a certain \n\nvalue. This is the value of ?1 in area B, which would occur if there were no wave \n\nfocusing and no wave defocusing. ?1 is smaller in area A than in area B. This means that \n\nthe position of the minimum of ?1+?2 at the right end of area A is nearer the crest level \n\nof the reef than the location of the breakerline for large values of s in area C (Figure \n\n2.32).  \n\nThe angle ?2 is positive in area A and negative in area B (Figure 2.31). It is positive \n\nin area A because the breaking occurs further away from the crest level of the reef than \n\nit would if there were no wave focusing. The value in area B is negative because the \n\nbreaking occurs nearer the crest level of the reef than it would if no wave focusing and \n\nno wave defocusing occur. \n\nBreaks on natural reefs are used by surfers. A study on 34 world-class surfing breaks \n\nlead to a bathymetric classification of these breaks (Mead et al., 2001b). A so-called \n\nramp, platform, focus, pinnacle, wedge, ledge and ridge were identified. All these \n\ncategories have a different influence on the behavior of the waves. The surfing wave \n\nquality at the world-class surfing breaks is provided by a combination of different \n\ncategories of bathymetry (Mead et al. 2001b).  Besides Mead et al. other researchers \n\nalso found that a platform can have a positive influence on the creation of surfable \n\nwaves. Smit and Mocke (2005) found in a numerical study that, in the design evolution \n\nof an artificial surfing reef for the coast of Dubai, a reef can create good surfable waves \n\nif the reef allows the waves to shoal prior to break without undergoing significant \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 52  \n\nrefraction, and therefore they included a platform in the reef design. However, the \n\ninfluence of the platform on the other surfability parameters besides the peel angle, from \n\na theoretical point of view, has not yet been described and will be done in this thesis. \n\n \n\n2.3 MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ARTIFICIAL REEFS \n\n2.3.1 MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ARTIFICIAL REEFS BUILT SO FAR \n\nUntil 2007 three artificial reefs have been built either with the purpose of enhancing \n\nof surfing possibilities (Artificial Surfing Reef), or jointly with other purposes, like \n\ncoastal protection (Multi Functional Artificial Reef). Below, the reefs are described in \n\nchronological order of building. The description of each reef focuses on the results of \n\nenvironmental and monitoring studies.  \n\n \n\nCable station (or Cables), Perth, Australia \n\nThe first ASR was built close to Perth in Australia and named Cable Station or \n\nCables (Ranasinghe et al., 2001). Construction was completed in December 1999. The \n\npurpose of the surf reef was to produce surfable waves regularly. It was not intended as \n\na shore protection structure, as the shoreline at Cable Station consists mainly of rocky \n\noutcrops and platforms, and so is naturally stable. \n\nThe overall dimensions are 80 m cross-shore by 90 m longshore. The reef (Figure \n\n2.35) was constructed of granite. \n\nTwo experimental design studies (one in a wave flume and one in a wave basin) and \n\nthree numerical surfability studies were undertaken for this reef. In addition, there was a \n\nbeach response study in the design phase, and an environmental study was also \n\nundertaken in which the marine habitats were observed, before and after construction.  \n\nThe researchers of this last study, Bowman Bishaw Gorham (2000) predicted the \n\nrecovery of the diversity of marine life that previously inhabited the area. Finally, a \n\npost-construction performance study was carried out. \n\nWhen 90 percent of the reef had been built its performance was studied. During the \n\n6-month study period, 77 surfable days were identified. The researchers concluded that \n\nthe performance of this reef exceeded expectations (Pattiaratchi, 2000), although this \n\nhas been disputed by some members of the local surfing population. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 53  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.35 - Plan view of design reef Cable station (Ranasinghe, 2001). \n\n \n\nNarrowneck reef, Gold Coast, Australia \n\nThe Narrowneck reef is situated off the Gold Coast, Australia. The construction was \n\nfinished in December 2000 (Ranasinghe et al., 2001). The primary objective of the reef \n\nwas to widen the beach and mitigate storm erosion, by retaining and protecting the \n\nnourished beach (over 1 million cubic metres of nourishment). The secondary objective \n\nwas to improve surfing.  \n\nThe overall dimensions are 400 m cross-shore by 200 m longshore. The submergence \n\nis 1.5 m below lowest tide (Jackson et al., 2005; Corbett et al., 2005). The reef (Figure \n\n2.36) was constructed of GSCs that weighed 160-300 tones, being typically 20 m long \n\nand up to 5 m diameter (Black, 2000). In all, 332 bags were placed. The total volume of \n\nthe reef at the end of construction was 110 000 cubic metres. The bags were filled with \n\nnatural sand in a split-hull hopper dredge. Once filled, the bags were dropped on the \n\nseabed using bow and stern satellite positioning to align the dredger. \n\nFor this reef one physical study was carried out (Turner et al., 2001). Besides the \n\nexperimental study, four numerical studies were carried out for the reef design (Black \n\nand Mead, 2001). The models implemented were a refraction model WBEND, a multi-\n\npurpose model 3D, a sediment transport model POL3DD, and a beach circulation and \n\nsediment transport model 2DBeach.  \n\nA pre-construction study (Ranasinghe et al., 2001) had been undertaken to \n\ninvestigate the likely environmental impacts on the area. During and after construction \n\nan ARGUS video imaging system was installed to monitor the shoreline response to the \n\nreef. This system is capable of providing very accurate quantitative information. Also, a \n\nnumber of hydrographic surveys have been carried out. It appeared from a beach \n\nmonitoring study (Jackson et al., 2005) in the period 2000-2004 that the beach updrift \n\nof the reef was of the order of 40 m wider than at the start of monitoring. In the lee of \n\nthe reef, an additional 30 m had been obtained. However, it has to be mentioned that \n\nOffshore  \ndirection \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 54  \n\nbefore construction a nourishment program of over one million cubic metres of sand \n\nwas carried out, so it is difficult to analyze the effect of nourishment and the effect of \n\nthe reef. Another result of four years of monitoring the reef is that, according to the \n\nresearchers, the size of the reef could have been smaller. Environmental research and \n\nanalysis have provided a comprehensive list of the diverse marine species found on the \n\nreef. It has become evident that since construction the marine habitats created by the \n\nreef are of significant value (and much bigger then expected), both environmentally and \n\nfor recreation in the form of diving and fishing.  \n\nThe GSCs were predicted to be stable in the 8-10 m amplitude waves that occur \n\nduring cyclones and up to now they have proved to be so. \n\nConcerning surfing, there use of the Narrowneck area has significantly increased for \n\nall types of surfing and a number of competitions are held at Narrowneck because of its \n\nmore reliable surfing conditions. However, Narrowneck\u2019s surfing attraction suffers from \n\nits proximity to numerous world class waves and the reef doesn\u2019t produce always \n\n\u2018perfect\u2019 waves - regardless of wind and wave conditions - as the general surfing public \n\nhoped (Jackson et al., 2005). \n\n \n \n\nOffshore direction \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.36 - Narrowneck reef, Gold Coast, Australia - Plan view (up) and side view (down) of reef \n(Black, 2000). \n\n \n\nPratte\u2019s reef, El Segundo, America \n\nPratte\u2019s reef near Los Angeles in America was constructed between 2000 and 2001 \n\n(Borrero and Nelson, 2003). The purpose of the reef was just to enhance recreational \n\nsurfing in order to offset the loss of surfing areas due to the construction of a groyne. \n\nThe overall dimensions are 30 m cross-shore with 70 m longshore. The submergence \n\nof the crest was 0.9 m below lowest tide. The reef (Figure 2.37) was constructed with \n\nabout 200 GSCs. The bags had a maximum volume of 7.9 cubic metres (the largest bags \n\nof the Narrowneck reef were about 400 cubic metres). The total volume was about 1600 \n\ncubic metres. The bags were filled in the port of Los Angeles and then loaded onto a \n\nbarge, to be taken to the site. The bags were placed in the surf zone by a barge-mounted \n\ncrane. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 55  \n\nThere is no available information about any design studies that have been carried out \n\nfor this reef. After construction, however, shoreline monitoring, bathymetric surveys, \n\ndiving surveys and surf quality surveys were undertaken. As a conclusion of the \n\nshoreline and bathymetry surveys it can be said that the reef had no effect on the \n\nshoreline and bathymetry. Any noticeable changes are due to natural seasonal changes. \n\nOne remarkable finding of the diving survey was the rapid biological growth on the \n\nbags. Within weeks of the initial bag installation, algae had begun to grow on the bags \n\nand schools of small fish were attracted to the site. The diving survey also revealed that \n\nseveral reef bag units were ripped or shredded and were losing their fill material. \n\nThe conclusion of the surf quality of the reef is that there is an almost complete \n\nabsence of surfers. The basic problem is that Pratte\u2019s reef is too small to significantly \n\nalter wave breaking and near shore coastal processes. The Narrowneck reef is 70 times \n\nlarger (in terms of dimensions).  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.37 \u2013 Plan view of design of Pratte reef (Henriquez, 2004). \n \n\n2.3.2 MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ARTIFICIAL REEFS UNDER CONSTRUCTION \n\nIn 2008 just two MFAR were under construction, although several studies on the \n\nviability of MFAR are underway around the world. As before, the description of this \n\nreef concentrates on the results of environmental and monitoring studies.  \n\n \n\nMount reef, Mount Maunganui, New Zealand \n\nThe reef is located on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s north island. The ASR is \n\ndesigned to have a primary purpose of creating high quality surfing waves. Besides that, \n\nthe Mount reef will be a research site for sustainable coastal protection and marine \n\necology. The sand banks, used by surfers, are constantly changing which means there \n\nare seldom consistent high-quality surfing waves at any particular spot. \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 56  \n\nThe dimensions of the reef are 70 m cross-shore and 90 m longshore. The reef \n\n(Figure 2.38) will be constructed of 24 GSCs. The bags vary from 30 m long with a \n\ndiameter of 1 m to 50 m long with a diameter of 3.5 m, This is a volume varying from \n\n27 to 660 cubic metres. A smaller geotextile tube (\u201cscour tube\u201d) will also be installed \n\nbehind the reef to prevent sand being scoured from under the two big bags.  \n\nThe total volume of the reef is 6 000 cubic metres, which is 1/20 of the Narrowneck \n\nreef. The reef will be constructed as follows: the empty bags will be tied onto a webbing \n\nlattice on dry land before being folded up and towed out to the reef site on a barge. The \n\nempty reef will then be offloaded and pulled down into position on the seabed using \n\nAncor Locs. Once secured in place the sand is pumped into the bags to fill them all up \n\nand create the shape of the reef. \n\nFor this reef one physical study has been carried out and published (Moores et al., \n\n2006). No numerical studies have been published. \n\n \n\n \n\nOffshore direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.38 - Plan view design Mount reef (source: www.mountreef.co.nz). \n \n\nBournemouth surf reef, Boscombe, Great Britain \n\nThe Bournemouth surf reef is the first artificial surf reef that has been in Europe. The \n\nconstruction started in October 2008. The reef will be located to the east of Boscombe \n\nPier, about 2.5 kilometres from Bournemouth Pier, and takes up approximately one \n\nhectare 225 metres from the shoreline. The reef is built from large geo-textile bags \n\npumped hard with sand. The sandbags are up to 70 m long, 2 m high and 6m wide. \n\nThe reef will be built in two layers: the bottom layer sitting on the sea bed consists of \n\nthree sections, on top of which lies the second layer of two sections. The first section is \n\ndeployed on Boscombe seabed, filled and then the second reef section is laid and filled \n\nand so on, until the reef is completed, once the fifth section is laid and filled.  \n\nThe bottom layer elements consist of three individual sections:  \n\n1. a geo-mat to minimize the structure sinking into the sea; \n\n2. overlain by a huge web of specially sewn material that looks like large seat belts;  \n\n3. on top of which huge geo-textile empty bags are attached. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 Functionality of a Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n 57  \n\nThese have been tied together to create the first section, which has then been folded \n\ninto a concertina and placed on a barge, ready for deployment on the seabed. When the \n\nweather is good enough for deployment (perfectly calm weather conditions are \n\nessential) the barge where it will be transported to the site at Boscombe. \n\nPrior to placing of the first set of bags, 11 temporary anchors have been set around \n\nthe perimeter of the surf reef site. They will be used for locating and securing the five \n\nreef sections elements when they are filled. Each reef element will be placed on a barge, \n\ntransported to the site, lowered, and the shore end of the reef will be attached to a set of \n\nanchors by divers. The barge will then be slowly winched along the reef site allowing \n\nthe section to gradually unfold and peel off into the water. The section will then be \n\npulled down onto the seabed with winches and secured in place on the anchors ready for \n\nfilling. \n\nThe top layer consists of two larger sets of bags secured to locating webbing without the \n\ngeo-mat layer, as they will be sitting firmly on top of existing sand bags. The sequence \n\npreviously described is followed again. When the filling phase has been completed, \n\ndivers will remove the location straps attached to the anchors, and the contractor will \n\nremove the temporary anchors.  \n\nNo physical or numerical studies of this project have been published. \n\n2.4 CONCLUSION \n\nIn this chapter the functionality of an MFAR has been described both in terms of \n\ncoastal protection and surfability. At one hand the functionality in terms of \n\nhydrodynamics and morphodynamics has been treated and at the other hand the state of \n\nart of the functionality of an MFAR has been presented. From the state of the art it can \n\nbe concluded that until 2007 three artificial reefs have been built in the world and that in \n\n2008 two other reefs were in construction. Another conclusion is that there is a \n\nsignificant lack of design guidelines for an MFAR and that the optimal design of a \n\nMFAR is site specific. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 58  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 59  \n\n \n \n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 60  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 61  \n\n3. DESIGNING AN OPTIMAL GEOMETRY \n\nDue to several reasons it would be unrealistic to present one optimal design of an \n\nMFAR for all locations in the world. These reasons have to do with local circumstances, \n\nlike tidal range, wave climate, bathymetry, currents and sediment transport and the \n\nbudget.  \n\nHowever, for the design of any artificial reef that will be built to both protect the \n\nlocal coastline and to create surfing conditions, several design parameters have to be \n\nconsidered. What should be taken into account for these parameters in terms of \n\nhydrodynamics is described below. This chapter concentrates on hydrodynamics, but \n\nonce an optimal geometry in relation to hydrodynamics has been determined, a \n\nthorough morphodynamic study (physical and/or numerical) is necessary to investigate \n\nthe capacity of an MFAR to protect a local coastline. \n\n3.1 MFAR-ANGLE \n\nThe choice of the MFAR-angle, ?, (Figure 3.1) is mainly related to the peel angle. As \ndescribed in chapter 2, section 2.2.2, the peel angle has its maximum for ? = 66\u00ba and \n\nconsequently this is the first option for this value. However, this maximum is found \n\nwith linear refraction and without wave focusing. In order to get the proper form for the \n\ndesign peel angle, numerical simulations, that take irregular waves and wave focusing \n\ninto account, ought to be performed.  \n\n \n\n \n? wave direction \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Reef angle (reef in plane view). \n\n \n\n3.2 THE HEIGHT OF THE REEF  \n\nThe height of the reef depends on: its horizontal dimensions, its distance from the \n\nshore, its submergence and its slopes. However, the height needs a minimum value in \n\nrelation to the breaker type. For a certain reef slope, the height determines the length of \n\nthe reef side. This should be long enough for the wave to feel the reef, otherwise the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 62  \n\nwave does not have enough space, and that it will also break in accordance with the \n\nslope of the bottom (see Figure 2.29). \n\nIt is not yet known how long a reef needs to be to get the desired breaker type under \n\ncertain wave conditions and slope of the reef (according to Equation (2.4)). The \n\nresearch of Smith and Kraus (1991) is closely related to the influence of the length of \n\nthe reef slope on the breaker type. They conducted a laboratory study of a wave \n\nbreaking over bars and artificial reefs and used the results to categorize the offshore \n\nbreaker type differently from Battjes (1974) when the bottom has a barred profile. \n\nHowever, this categorization is general, for varying reef slopes and wave conditions, \n\nand the length of the reef slope is not taken into account, so it is not appropriate for this \n\nstudy.  \n\nTo determine the exact length of the reef side required for the proper breaker type, as \n\na function of the wave length, and thus the value of the reef height, numerical \n\nsimulations should be performed. In order to choose the initial geometry for the \n\nnumerical simulations, a fraction of the local wave length can be taken as the minimum \n\nlength of the reef; take, for example, 1/4 times the local wave length. Thus, for a \n\nrelatively long wave period of 14 seconds and a reef start at a depth of 4 m, the \n\nminimum length is 22 m. Assuming 1:10 slope, the minimum height is then 2.2 m for \n\nwaves breaking on the crest of the reef. For the design, an extra value can be added, so \n\nwaves can also break a little before reaching the crest, for example, 0.3 m. In this \n\nexample, the minimum height that should be taken is 2.5 m. For shorter wave periods \n\n(or shorter wave lengths) a lower reef height should achieve the design breaker type.  \n\n3.3 THE GEOMETRY OF THE REEF \n\nThe choice of the form of the geometry is, like the choice of the MFAR-angle, \n\nmainly related to the peel angle. An initial design choice for the initial geometry shape \n\nfor the numerical simulations can be a delta form composed of two rides (a left and a \n\nright ride) with a constant MFAR-angle ?? = 66\u00ba, as described previously. \nSuch a delta structure, which will be designed to create surfable waves, could be \n\nplaced on the sea bottom or on a platform. A platform is, in theory, positive for the \n\ncoastal protection aspect of the reef, because it makes the (large) waves break over it \n\nacross its whole width (Smit and Mocke, 2005). But the effect of the presence or \n\nabsence of a platform on the current cells that will be formed needs to be studied with \n\nnumerical simulations. Regarding the surfer parameters of peel angle, ?, breaker type, \nhere related to the corresponding inshore Iribarren number, b? , and wave height at the \n\nbreaking point, Hb, it has to be determined if the platform has a positive influence.  \n\nThe peel angle should be taken between 40 and 60 degrees for the waves to be \n\nsurfable for most surfers (see Table 2.2 and Figure 2.13), and the peel angle has a \n\nmaximum for an MFAR angle of 66 degrees.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 63  \n\nSome calculations have been made to gain more insight into peel angle values. To \n\nestimate the peel angle we have to know what the design wave height is. The larger the \n\ndesign wave height the smaller the peel angle will be (the wave breaks sooner, and so \n\nrefracts less).  \n\nCalculations were performed for a reef consisting of a platform with a delta structure \n\non top, having an MFAR-angle of 66 degrees and where the submergence of the reef is \n\n1.5 m, for safety reasons (see section 3.4 in this chapter).  \n\nThe wave conditions were wave periods of 6, 10 and 14 s and wave heights of 1, 2, 3 \n\nand 4 m and the breaker criterion was chosen to be Hb = 1.1hb (Table 3.1). Over gentle \n\nslopes, waves are expected to break when Hb = ? *hb, where Hb is the breaker height and \n\nhb is the breaking depth, and ? is equal to 0.78 (Sverdrup and Munk, 1946). As the \n\nbeach slope increases, as though over a reef, the value of ? increases for the same wave \n\nsteepness in deep water. The chosen value of ? of 1.1 is based on the work of Kaminsky \n\nand Kraus (1993). These researchers derived an empirical formula in a review of \n\nseventeen data sets obtained by various investigators in laboratory experiments. The \n\nformula is: \n\n \n270\n\n 201\n.\n\nb . ?= ??   (3.1) \n\n \nwhere ?b is the breaker condition and ??  is the deep water breaker parameter. ??  is \nequal to b?  with the exception that the breaker wave height has to be replaced by the \n\nwave height in deep water, H0. Assuming a reef slope of 1:10, the mean value of ?b is \n\n1.1 for the tested wave conditions, and the maximum is 1.3. \n\nThe peel angle was computed for two depths for the platform: 4.0 m, which is the \n\nminimum depth of the platform in the example cited in the part about the height of the \n\nreef (1.5 m submergence + 2.5 m minimum height of the delta structure), and 5.0 m \n\n(Table 3.1). Waves that break before they have traveled a length equal to 1.0 m height \n\nof the delta are not taken into account, because they are not expected to result in \n\nplunging waves. Although the calculations use linear theory and the wave focusing is \n\nnot taken into account, they give an indication about the values of the peel angle.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 64  \n\nTable 3.1 - Peel angles for a reef with a submergence of 1.5 m and reef start depths of 4.0 m (left) and 5.0 \nm (right). \n\n         a) Reef starts at 4.0 m depth.   b) Reef starts at 5.0 m depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResults from Table 3.1 show that for wave heights in the range of 1-2 m the case \n\nwith a platform at the minimum depth of 4.0 m offers more peel angle conditions within \n\nthe range of amateurs, i.e. between 40 and 60 degrees. For cases with a platform lower \n\nthan 5.0 m under the still water level the peel angles will be even lower than the values \n\nshown in Table 3.1b. \n\nAs the peel angle values are better for a start depth of the delta structure as small as \n\npossible, taking the example minimum height of the reef, it can be concluded that a \n\nplatform at the seaward end of the structure definitely has a positive influence on the \n\npeel angle.  \n\nHowever, if the platform is under the whole delta structure, it probably has a \n\nrelatively negative influence on the peel angle at the shoreward end compared with the \n\ncase without a platform, because the delta structure can be higher at this point.  \n\nMoreover, the influence of a platform on the other two surfer parameters, i.e., the \n\nbreaker type and the wave height at the breaking point, has not yet been investigated. In \n\norder to analyze this, the qualitative development of the peel angle, ?, the inshore \nIribarren number, b? , and the wave height at the breaking point, Hb, along the breaker \n\nline are presented for both cases presented before: with and without a platform under the \ndelta structure. The development of ?, 1/ b?  and Hb is presented in Figure 3.2 and shows \nthat, for the case without a platform, ?, 1/ b?  and Hb are smaller at the beginning of the \n\nreef and larger at the end. These differences are caused by more refraction at the \n\nbeginning of the reef (by longer slope) and less refraction at its end (by shorter slope) in \nthe case without a platform. When wave focusing no longer plays a role, ?, b?  and Hb \n\nincrease towards the end of the reef without a platform and stay constant in the case \n\nwith a platform. \n\n \n\nT\\H 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m  T\\H 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m \n\n6 s * 35.7 44.6 -  6 s * 31.9 39.1 - \n\n10 s * 38.6 49.5 X  10 s * 33.8 41.8 X \n\n14 s - 41.8 X X  14 s - 36.0 45.3 X \n\nBold values  = wave breaks on the reef \n              * = waves go over the reef \n              x             = wave has already broken or breaks at the beginning of \n                                the reef  \n               -             = rarely existing wave conditions at west coast of Portugal \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 65  \n\n \n   ?, 1/ b? , Ho \n\nBreaker line, s \n\nWith platform \n\nWithout platform \n\n \nFigure 3.2 - Relative development of the peel angle, wave height and Iribarren number along the breaker \n\nline. \n\n \n\nFrom this analysis, it can be concluded that the choice of a platform does have an \n\ninfluence on the three surfer parameters: peel angle, breaker type and wave height at the \n\nbreaking point. Wave defocusing is not taken into account in this analysis, for two \n\nreasons. First, because the area over which the wave focusing occurs is relatively small \n\nand second because the contributions to the peel angle of wave defocusing are relatively \n\nsmall compared with the area where wave focusing occurs, as described in the \n\ntheoretical background. \n\nRegarding the peel angle, the choice of a platform is not straightforward. A small \n\nvariation in the peel angle along the ride does not represent a problem since surfers \n\nactually like some variation. However, the peel angle should be between 40 and 60 \n\ndegrees, as mentioned before. Calculations have shown that these values of the peel \n\nangle are reached with the platform at the minimum depth for most wave conditions. So \n\nin terms of the peel angle, a platform in the first part of the reef is a better option. \n\nHowever, if the height at the last part of the reef is smaller in the case without a \n\nplatform, the option of no platform would be better because refraction will be less.  \nRegarding the breaker type, the use of a platform is again a better option, because b?  \n\nis smaller at the beginning and stays constant along the ride. \n\nRegarding to the wave height at the breaker point, the preferred wave height depends \n\non the skill of the surfer. However, it is easier to start surfing when the wave is \n\nsomewhat higher, at the beginning, especially when the peel angle is small. So, it can be \n\nconcluded that, for the wave height at the breaker point, a platform is a good option, \n\nsince for this case the wave is higher at the beginning of the reef. \n\nIn conclusion, the use of a platform has a positive influence on the most important \n\nsurfer parameters: the peel angle, the breaker type and the wave height at the breaker \n\npoint. However, not using a platform is better for the peel angle if the reef is less high, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 66  \n\neven though it should be higher than the minimum, as stated in the part about the height \n\nof the reef.  \n\nMoreover, constructing a platform only at the seaward part of the delta structure \n\nwould give a maximum peel angle along the entire ride. In some cases this is actually \n\nthe only possibility, because the platform intersects with the bottom (Figure 3.3). \n\nPositioning the reef more seawards in order to construct a platform under the whole \n\ndelta is often not an option since, as will be explained in the part of about the horizontal \n\ndimensions, the distance between the shoreline and the structure is established with the \n\nobjective of preventing coastline erosion. \n\n \n reef \n\nplatform \n\nIntersection platform and bottom  \n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Intersection of platform and bottom. \n\n \n\nEven though, in theory, a platform has a positive influence on the main surfer \n\nparameters, it still has to be taken into account that the exact influence can vary \n\nconsiderably with different geometries, and especially the reef angle is expected to be of \n\nmuch influence. One way to investigate this influence is to perform numerical \n\nsimulations.  \n\nAnother important factor that should be taken into account is that the form of the \n\nplatform in the horizontal plane should be chosen so that its volume is as small as \n\npossible.  \n\n3.4 THE SUBMERGENCE OF THE REEF \n\nThe submergence of the reef is determined by two factors. Firstly it should be \n\nshallow enough for the design waves to break on the reef. Secondly it should be deep \n\nenough to ensure the safety of surfers.  \n\nWith regard to the first factor, the submergence is dependent on the design breaking \n\nwave height and the breaking condition. Assuming a critical breaking condition of \n\nHb = 1.3*h, which gives the smallest breaking depth, the submergence of the reef with, \n\nfor example, a 2.0 m design breaking wave height is 1.5 m.  \n\nConcerning the second factor, it is a known fact that the water depth during backflow \n\nunder the wave trough can be very shallow and the reef may even become emerged \n\n(\u2018suck dry\u2019). However, surfing is a sport that involves risks. Surfers know that and most \n\nof them develop their own way to see if they can surf a certain section safely. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 67  \n\nNonetheless, safety should be considered in the design. For diving in pools, FINA \n\n(International Federation of Swimming) regulations suggest 1.8 m as an acceptable \n\ndepth for submergence (Corbett et al., 2005). But surfers tend to fall off their boards \n\nrather than dive vertically, reducing both the depth of the dive and the risk of serious \n\ninjury (e.g. damage to the neck and spine). This fact and the physical experiments \n\nconducted by Corbett and Tomlinson (2002), in which the water depth above a reef with \n\ncertain submergence was investigated for different wave heights, led to the design \n\nchoice that submergence should be deeper than the design wave height in deep water. \n\nAs an example, if the design wave height is 1.5 m, the minimum submergence for safety \n\nwould be 1.5 m. The sucking dry phenomenon is probably hard to prevent completely, \n\nespecially with high waves at low tide. Experience with the Narrowneck reef has \n\nindicated that, with a submergence of 1.5 m, the crest containers \u2018sucked dry\u2019 during \n\nlarger wave conditions (>2 m) at low tide (Jackson et al., 2005). In specific design \n\nstudies numerical simulations will be needed to verify if and for what wave heights this \n\nphenomenon occurs. \n\nIt should be noted that the design wave height and the corresponding design \n\nsubmergence mentioned above are for low tide, because this tidal level gives the critical \n\nsubmergence. But many coastal zones have tidal conditions, so the influence of the tide \n\non the peel angle should not be neglected. To investigate this influence on the peel \n\nangle, calculations assume a tidal level 1.5 m higher than that in Table 3.1a) and b), so \n\nthe submergence is now 3.0 m and the depths of the platform are 5.5 and 6.5 m. Table \n\n3.2 show the values of the peel angle obtained.  \n\n \nTable 3.2 - Peel angles for a reef with a submergence of 3.0 m and reef start at depths of 5.5 m (a) and 6.5 \n\nm (b). \n\n   a) Reef starts at 5.5 m depth.      b) Reef starts at 6.5 m depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom Table 3.2 it can be seen that in both cases the peel angles are high enough for \n\nboth amateur and professional surfers, but the waves that break over the delta have an \n\nH0 of 3-4 m. However, by refraction and shoaling, the Hb on the reef will be even higher \n\nT\\H 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m  T\\H 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m \n\n6 s * * * -  6 s * * * - \n\n10 s * * * 46.5  10 s * * * 41.4 \n\n14 s - * 42.3 51.1  14 s - * * 44.5 \n\nBold values  = wave breaks on the reef \n              * = waves go over the reef \n              x             = wave has already broken or breaks on the beginning of \n                                 the platform  \n               -             = rarely existing wave conditions at west coast of Portugal \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 68  \n\nthan 4 m. These wave heights cannot be surfed by surfers with skill levels 3 and 4. In \n\nconclusion, it can be said that higher tidal levels make surfing impossible for most \n\namateurs. The tide also influences the breaker type by affecting the breaker wave height \n\nover the delta. Consequently, a guideline would be to pay attention to the fact that just \n\none tidal level can be the \u2018design\u2019 level if the reef is designed for a certain category of \n\nsurfers. \n\nThe minimum submergence and the minimum needed height of the reef for surfing, \n\ntogether with the distance offshore of the reef, and the slope of the sea bottom have a \n\nlarge influence on the effectiveness of a reef in terms of creating surfable waves. The \n\nslope of the sea bottom, the minimum submergence and the distance from the base of \n\nthe delta to the shoreline will determine the height at the shore side of the reef. In order \n\nto verify achievement of the minimum height needed for surfing, some calculations \n\nhave been performed.  \n\nTable 3.3 shows the values of the reef heights at the shore side for a reef with a \n\nsubmergence of 1.5 m, a distance from the base of the delta to the shoreline of 175 m, a \n\ndistance from the apex of the delta to the shoreline of 250 m (see section 3.5 in this \n\nchapter) and different slopes of the sea bottom. In this case the cross-shore length of the \n\ndelta is 75 m. \n \n\nTable 3.3 - Reef heights for different bottom slopes. \n\n Distance from    \n\nshoreline (m) \n1:25 1:50 1:75 1:100 \n\n  175 (base delta) 5.5 m 2.0 m 0.8 m 0.3 m \n\n  250 (apex delta) 8.5 m 3.5 m 1.8 m 1.0 m \n\n \n\nA height of 2.0 m at the base of the reef is here accepted as the minimum value for \n\nsurfing. This is less than the value of the example presented in section 3.2 in this \n\nchapter, where the minimum height was 2.5 m, because the reef will be higher further \n\nseawards where the wave rays that reach the end of the reef start.  \n\nTable 3.3 shows that the minimum slope value for building a multifunctional \n\nartificial surfing reef that functions properly is 1:50, because then the minimum height \n\nof 2.0 m is reached at the base of the delta. If a platform is chosen in the design, the \n\nintersection of the platform with the bottom, as a consequence of the chosen minimum \n\nheight, gives a figure of 50 m under the seaward part of the delta. It is preferable for \n\nsurfers to make the ride from the seaward crest of the delta up to the base of the delta. \n\nSome simple refraction calculations can give an indication as to whether the wave rays \n\nat the shoreward intersection of the platform and the reef still reach the crest of the delta \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 69  \n\n(Figure 3.4). Numerical simulations have to be performed to confirm these simple \n\ncalculations. \n\n \n \n\nPlatform \n\nOffshore direction \n\nDelta \n\nWave ray \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Wave rays reaching the crest delta. \n\n \n\n3.5 THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSIONS \n\nThe horizontal alongshore dimension depends on the length of the local coastline to \n\nbe protected. The cross-shore dimension of the reef depends on the design length of the \n\nride, which is the length of the breaker line at one of the sides of the reef (Figure 2.30). \n\nThis dimension is limited, however. As mentioned in the state of art, Ranasinghe and \n\nTurner (2006b) found that the principal mode of shoreline response to submerged \n\nstructures can vary from erosive to accretive, depending on the offshore distance to the \n\nstructure (Figure 2.5). Based on these results, a predictive empirical relationship is \n\nproposed as a preliminary engineering tool to assess the shoreline response to \n\nsubmerged structures. This relationship is Sa/SZW > 1.5, where Sa is the distance from \n\nthe apex of the structure to the undisturbed shoreline and SZW is the natural surf zone \n\nwidth. The distance Sa should clearly not be too large, because the effect of the structure \n\non the morphodynamic processes adjacent to the shoreline will start to decline with \n\nincreasing values.  \n\n3.6 THE SLOPE OF THE REEF STRUCTURE \n\nA surfable wave for amateurs should be plunging, almost spilling. Based on \n\nexperimental results with a 1 m wave height, Henriquez (2004) found that the inshore \n\nIribarren number, ?b, should be between 0.6 and 0.9 to get surfable waves. These are \n\nplunging waves with relatively small inshore Iribarren numbers (see Table 2.4). Some \n\ncalculations using linear theory have been performed for different wave heights to \n\n\n\nChapter 3 Designing an Optimal Geometry \n\n 70  \n\nanalyze which slopes will cause waves to break as a plunging breaker type. Figure 3.5 \n\nshows the inshore Iribarren numbers for a slope (that the wave meets) varying from 1:6 \n\nto 1:18, a wave height at breakpoint varying from 1 to 4 m and a wave period of 10 s. \n\nAs can be seen, only a few combinations of slope and wave height give a plunging \n\nbreaking wave in the surf range. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.5 - Surf range. \n\n \n The values of b?  that lie in the surf range (given by Henriquez, 2004) are for slopes \n\nbetween 1:8 and 1:18, as can be seen in Table 3.4. It should be pointed out that the \n\ntheory used is linear and that the surf range of 0.6 m to 0.9 m was found in experiments \n\nfor a wave height of 1 m (prototype) at the wave maker, and here it is applied to a wave \n\nheight range of 1 to 4 m at the breakpoint. However, it does give an indication as to \n\nwhat combination of reef slopes and breaking wave heights give surfable waves. Based \n\non this indication an initial slope of the reef can be chosen to start with in numerical \n\nsimulations. \n \n\nTable 3.4 - Inshore Iribarren number for different slopes and wave heights in the surf range. \n\nTan ?

This will have to be confirmed \n\nwith numerical simulations for each specific set of geometry and wave conditions.  \n\nThe design choice for the slope at the shoreward end of the delta structure and for the \n\nslope of the platform at all sides should be as low as possible, in order to keep its \n\nvolume smaller. \n\n3.7 CONCLUSION \n\nAs a result of a theoretical study, a preliminary design, achieved step by step, is \n\nproposed for a multi-functional artificial reef making use of the theory and the state of \n\nthe art. The proposed reef geometry is used as initial design in the numerical and \n\nphysical tests, which are executed to analyze the capacity of a multi-functional reef \n\nbreakwater to protect a stretch of the northern coast of Portugal and increase the local \n\nsurfing possibilities. Wave focusing is not taking into account in the formation of the \n\npreliminary design. The main design parameters for a MFAR are the reef angle, the \n\nheight of the reef, the geometry of the reef, the submergence of the reef, the horizontal \n\ndimensions and the slope of the reef structure. Taking into account the condition that the \n\nproposed geometry will only function properly on a sea slope bottom of less than 1:50, \n\nthe main preliminary choices are as follows: the upper part of the structure is delta \n\nshaped with an angle of 66\u00ba and a side slope of 1:10, and the lower part consists of a \n\nplatform whose slopes are as steep as possible. The position of the reef should be such \n\nthat the distance from the apex of the structure to the undisturbed shoreline is greater \n\nthan 1.5 the natural surf zone width. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n \n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional \nArtificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n75 \n\n4. INVESTIGATION OF MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ARTIFICIAL REEF \nCROSS-SECTION DESIGN PARAMETERS \n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe optimal geometry for a multi-functional artificial reef is the geometry that \n\nprotects the local coastline and offers surfing possibilities in the best possible way \n\naccording to the local conditions. This investigation concerns an optimal geometry of a \n\nmulti-functional artificial reef to be applied in the west coast of Portugal. Six parameters \n\nhave to be defined for an optimal geometry, as mentioned before (see chapter 3, the \n\ntheoretical study): \n\n\u2022 the height of the reef; \n\n\u2022 the side slope of the reef; \n\n\u2022 the submergence of the reef; \n\n\u2022 the reef angle; \n\n\u2022 the geometry of the reef (with or without a platform); \n\n\u2022 the horizontal dimensions. \n\n \n\nThree of them have mainly a 2DV behavior (x, z): the height, the submergence and the \n\nslope of the reef. For these parameters, some values were suggested, namely: \n\n\u2022 the height of the reef, h_reef, to be equal to 0.25*Lw, being Lw the local wave length \n\nat the start of the reef; \n\n\u2022 the submergence of the reef, S, to be equal to the design wave height; \n\n\u2022  the seaward slope of the reef, s_reef to be 1:10. \n\nThis chapter treats the confirmation of those values for the wave and bathymetric \n\nconditions at the west coast of Portugal, where the case study, the coast of Leirosa, is \n\nlocated. For that, a 2DV physical and numerical study was done focusing on the breaker \n\ntype regarding surfing.  \n\nThe situation in Leirosa is currently especially vulnerable. A frontal dune that runs \n\nfrom the groin of Leirosa till almost the mouth of Extremal stream is totally destructed. \n\nThis has caused a retreat of the coastline and has put at risk (Lopes et al., 2003): \n\na) the agglomerate of Leirosa, which situation is not yet critical, but it has to be kept \n\nan eye on; \n\nb) the emissary of urban wastewater of the agglomerate van Leirosa, which extends \n\nparallel to the coast, to the south, and that is connected to the emissary of \n\ncellulose factories; \n\nc) the pressure chamber of submarine emissary of cellulose located about 1 km south \n\nof Leirosa. \n\nA fragment of the dune in front of the pressure chamber of the emissary was partly \n\nstrengthened in 2005, using bags of geotextile filled with sand on a length of about 120 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n76 \n\nm as described in Chapter 1. This has been done after storms that occurred in February \n\n2001 which affected especially this zone and that will lead to a gradual and dangerous \n\nweakening in the next years. Although the resolution of the large vulnerability of this \n\nzone by the construction of a groin south of the cellulose emissary is considered, such a \n\nheavy protection structure is not planned in the POOC (legally development plan of the \n\ncoast). The research of this thesis is a contribution to the implementation of a solution \n\nfor Leirosa, along a very sensitive coastal fragment that is shown in Figure 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.1 - View from the air with Leirosa at the top, pressure chamber of the emissary in the middle and \nthe part of the dune in front of the pressure chamber that was partly repaired in January 2006 (Antunes do \n\nCarmo). \n\n \n\nThe bottom slope of 1:50 is used, since it is a reasonable value for the centre of the \n\nwest coast of Portugal. The design wave condition for surfing is chosen in order to have \n\na good surfable wave and to be a common wave condition at the Portuguese west coast. \n\nFor that, the wave regime near by Figueira da Foz (Capit\u00e3o et al., 1999) was analyzed, \n\nFigure 4.2. Figueira da Foz is situated near by Leirosa, the case study place, for which \n\nthe optimal geometry will be defined. In the future bathymetric and wave data at \n\nLeirosa itself will be gathered.  \n\nFrom Figure 4.2, it can be seen that the wave height, Hs, of 1.5 to 2.5 m and the mean \n\nzero up-crossing period, Tz, of 6 to 8 s are the most frequent. Based on these values for \n\nthe regular design wave condition, a wave height, H, of 1.5 m is chosen and a period, T, \n\nof 9 s. The period T is chosen to be higher than 6 to 8 s, because the Tp is used here as \n\nthe characteristic value for T. Assuming a Jonswap spectrum, Tp is 1.25 times Tz (Goda, \n\n1987). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.2 - Wave regime near by Figueira da Foz (Capit\u00e3o et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nIn section 4.2 the physical study conducted to investigate the height of the reef and \n\nthe submergence is described. The physical tests show clearly the breaker shape, \n\nhowever the parameters can not be varied thoroughly. Besides that no data about the \n\nexact position of wave breaking and the height at the breaking point were available from \n\nthe physical experiments. In order to fill this gap, complementary studies were made \n\nusing a numerical model that solves the Reynolds average Navier-Stokes (RANS) \n\nequations, called COBRAS-UC (Garcia et al., 2004), (COBRAS = Cornell Breaking \n\nWaves and Structures, UC = University of Cantabria). The investigation on the height, \n\nthe submergence and on the slope of the reef with the COBRAS-UC model is presented \n\nin section 4.3.  \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n78 \n\n4.2 PHYSICAL STUDY \n\n4.2.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe objective of the experiments is two-fold: to record the breaker type over an \n\nartificial reef with a smooth slope and to measure surface level elevations over a reef \n\nconstructed with an impermeable broad-crested submerged structure.  \n\nThese measurements provide a unique set of data, allowing one to estimate the \n\nbreaker type on submerged broad-crested breakwaters with a smooth slope. Besides that \n\nthe data provides the possibility to calibrate and validate numerical models. Particularly, \n\nit will be possible to verify, for a submerged reef with a smooth slope, the \n\ncategorization of the Iribarren number presented in the literature (Battjes, 1974), that \n\nwas made for a single slope beach. \n\n4.2.2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  \n\nThe term \u2018breaker type\u2019 refers to the form of a depth-limited wave at breaking and \n\ninfluences other breaking-wave properties. Although there are several classifications of \n\nbreaker type, it is generally accepted that waves break by spilling, plunging, collapsing, \n\nand surging (Galvin, 1968; 1972). Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 2 gives more information \n\nabout the breaker types.  \n\nSmith and Kraus (1991) performed a laboratory study for waves breaking over bars \n\nand artificial reefs. They constructed the bar of marine plywood and tested six different \n\ndesign seaward angles and four design shoreward angles. They tested several \n\ncombinations of shoreward and seaward angles of the bar, five regular wave conditions \n\nand three random wave conditions. They found for barred profiles the following \n\ntransition values:  \n\n- surging or collapsing if ?0  > 1.2; \n\n- plunging if 0.4 &lt;?0 &lt;1.2; \n\n- spilling if ?0  &lt; 0.4. \n\nHowever, their results are for narrow crested artificial reefs and the influences of the \n\nstructure submergence, of the length of the slope and of the depth at the start of the \n\nstructure on the breaker type and on the Iribarren number were not studied.  \n\nRegarding the breaking behavior on artificial reefs with a smooth slope, just one \n\nstudy has been conducted in a wave flume by Corbett and Tomlinson (2002). They \n\nperformed a physical study for Noosa Main Beach in Australia on a permeable reef built \n\nfrom geotextile sand containers to investigate the wave breaking behavior and \n\nassociated safety issues for an artificial reef. The analysis of the results of these tests \n\nwas especially focused on the breaker type, on the breaker wave height and on the \n\nbreaker location as an indication for the safety of the submerged reef. However, even \n\nthough several submergences were tested, no analysis of the relation between the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n79 \n\nbreaker type and the corresponding Iribarren number were made. Furthermore, the \n\ninfluence of the length of the slope on the breaker type and the corresponding values of \n\nthe Iribarren number was not investigated. \n\nIn the present work, the transition values for submerged broad-crested artificial reefs \n\nwill be determined taking into account the following structure characteristics: \n\n- submergence; \n\n- length of the seaward slope. \n\n4.2.3 JUSTIFICATION OF EXPERIMENTS \n\nThe purpose of these experiments is, as referred, to investigate the relation between \n\nthe breaker type and the submergence and the length of the slope of a broad-crested \n\nreef. \n\nBased on the Iribarren number, the breaker type has to be the same for the same \n\nslope, the same offshore wave height (or breaker wave height) and the same period. \n\nHowever, as indicated by the physical experiments conducted by Henriquez (2004), the \n\nsubmergence has also an influence on the breaker type. Besides the submergence, it is \n\nexpected that the length of the slope of the reef will also have an influence on the \n\nbreaker type. This expectation is based on the fact that the wave will develop differently \n\nwhen the slope has a difference in length due to difference in shoaling. \n\nTo investigate the influence of the length of the reef and the submergence on the \n\nbreaker-type, different tests were made with: \n\na. the same wave conditions, the same submergence and different lengths of the \n\nslope; \n\nb. the same wave conditions, the same length of the slope and several \n\nsubmergences. \n\n4.2.4 EXPERIMENTAL SET UP \n\nPhysical model tests were made in one of the LNEC\u2019s flume with the following \n\ndimensions:  73.0 m long, 3.0 m wide and 2.0 m deep. The model was operating \n\naccording to Froude\u2019s similarity law, with a geometric scale of 1:10. \n\nTwo geometries (low and high geometry), with a structure built on concrete, were \n\ntested with two different values for the length of the seaward slope. Figure 4.3 shows \n\nthe flume: the left picture is in the direction of the wave maker and the right one in a \n\ndirection contrary to the wave-maker. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n80 \n\n            \nFigure 4.3 - LNEC\u2019s flume used for the tests. \n\n \n\nThe seaward slope of the reef, s_reef, was constant and equal to 1:10. This is a \n\nregular value for the side slope of a multi-functional artificial reef. The shoreward slope \n\nshould be as steep as possible, 1:2 or 1:3. \n\nIn chapter 3 is mentioned that the minimum length of the reef, in order to get a good \n\nsurfable wave, is 1/4 times the local wavelength. Based on this assumption the length of \n\nthe low geometry, Ls, was chosen to be 19 m in prototype scale. For the high geometry \n\nthe length of the reef, Ls, was twice the value for the lower geometry: 36 m in prototype \n\nscale. As a consequence the height of the reef, h_reef, is for the low geometry 1.9 m and \n\nfor the high geometry 3.6 m in prototype scale. \n\nThe length from the wavemaker till the start of the foreshore is 18.2 m in prototype \n\nscale. The slope of the foreshore, s, is 1:50. The length of the foreshore, L_init, for the \n\nlow geometry is 240 m and for the high geometry is 155 m, all in prototype scale; this is \n\nat least 1.5 times the wavelength at the wave maker for each depth tested. The height of \n\nthe foreshore, h_fore, is for the low geometry 4.80 m and for the high geometry 3.10 m \n\nin prototype scale. Based on that and on the reef submergences, the water depth at the \n\nwave maker was defined and varies from 9.1 m and 7.5 m, in prototype scale. The width \n\nof the reef, Lc, is 75 m, in prototype scale. This value is at least one time the \n\nwavelength. Consequently, it was determined for all periods tested and for the water \n\ndepth at the start of the deepest reef (larger submergence) tested for the high geometry. \n\nFigure 4.4 shows the geometry parameters of the reef.

Each wave \n\nheight was tested for three different periods. Each test lasted 320 seconds, which \n\ncorresponds to, at least, 100 waves.  \n\nThe selection of the submergence values was based on the following. In order to \n\nguarantee breaking, a depth smaller than 0.8*Hb was assumed to be necessary \n\n(Kaminsky and Kraus, 1993), where the height of the wave at breaking Hb was chosen \n\nto be at minimum 1.0*Hwm.  Hwm is the wave height at the wave maker. For most wave \n\nheights a submergence of 0.8*Hb was tested. However, in order to see if waves with \n\nlarger submergences than that will also break, some wave heights have been tested with \n\nsubmergences of (0.8*Hb + 0.04) m and (0.8*Hb + 2*0.04) m. Table 4.3 shows the test \n\nconditions.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n83 \n\nTable 4.3 - Test conditions (model scale). \n\n \n\nHwm(m) S (m) h (m) T (s) \n\n0.08 0.75 \n\n0.12 0.79 0.10 \n\n0.16 0.83 \n\n0.08 0.75 \n\n0.12 0.79 \n\n0.16 0.83 \n0.15 \n\n0.20 0.87 \n\n0.12 0.79 \n\n0.16 0.83 \n\n0.20 0.87 \n0.20 \n\n0.24 0.91 \n\n0.16 0.83 \n\n0.20 0.87 0.25 \n\n0.24 0.91 \n\n0.20 0.87 \n0.30 \n\n0.24 0.91 \n\n0.35 0.24 0.91 \n\n2.52, 2.84, 3.16 \n \n\n4.2.6 INSTRUMENTATION \n\nIt was the primary purpose of this experimental research to obtain accurate images of \n\nthe breaker type. In each test the breaker type was captured by video techniques. A \n\nvideo camera recorded the breaker type of the breaking wave. On the windows a grid of \n\n10 cm by 10 cm was made to help the measurements made from the videos. \n\nAlso 8 wave resistive type gauges were mounted in order to measure surface \n\nelevation at several positions along the wave flume, mostly positioned in the breaker \n\nzone. The data collected will provide mainly wave height records, but it can also be \n\nused to obtain mean surface displacement (setup/setdown). Two sensors, gauge 1 and \n\ngauge 2, remained throughout the experiment at a seaward location close to the wave \n\npaddle, for control and repeatability tests. Another gauge was located in the beginning \n\nof the foreshore slope and another in the beginning of the reef. The remained 4 gauges \n\nwere mounted in the breaking zone. All tests were repeated with these 4 gauges, 0.5 m \n\nmoved in the direction of the end of the channel. In that way at eight positions, 0.25 m \n\nfrom each other, in the breaking zone the time series of the surface elevation were \n\nacquired (Figure 4.9). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n84 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Schematic representation of the gauges along the channel. \n\n4.2.7 RESULTS \n\nThe results, in what concerns to the mean wave height in front of the paddle, \n\nobtained in the tests with the high and low geometry were not the same. However, since \n\nthe goal of the experiments was to see the influence of the length of the reef and the \n\ninfluence of the submergence, comparison of the breaker types was made by comparing \n\nthe results of the breaker types with the same Iribarren number ranges. From all videos \n\nin which the wave breaks in the window, a picture of the breaker type was made after \n\naround 2 min of tests, which is about 30-40 waves, depending on the period used in the \n\ntest. These pictures were selected into 5 categories of the Iribarren number: smaller than \n\n0.6, from 0.6 to 0.8, from 0.8 to 1.0, from 1.0 to 1.2 and larger than 1.2. These \n\ncategories were made to analyze the breaker type more conveniently. All pictures of the \n\nbreaking waves are presented in annex I according to the Iribarren number in such a \n\nway that different lengths of the reef and different submergences can be compared \n\neasily. If there are pictures of a wave in the window with almost equal Iribarren \n\nnumbers for the same submergence and different lengths of the reef they are put besides \n\neach other. If no equal Iribarren number could be found for the other tested length, the \n\nspot besides the picture is kept empty in Annex I. In the pictures, Hm is the mean wave \n\nheight, Tm is the mean wave period in the wave gauge at 5.1 m from the wave maker \n\n(gauge 1), S is the submergence and Ir is the Iribarren number.  \n\nBased on the test results, some conclusions for each category can be made and are \n\npresented hereafter, together with two comparing pictures for different reef geometries \n\nwith the same submergences that illustrate the results. All breaking waves analyzed \n\nhere, are plunging. Due to the fact that all wave shapes are plunging it is not possible to \n\ndraw a conclusion regarding the influence of the length of the reef and the submergence \n\non the wave shape according to the categorization of Battjes (1974). However, within \n\neach mentioned category of smaller than 0.6, from 0.6 to 0.8, from 0.8 to 1.0, from 1.0 \n\nto 1.2 and larger than 1.2 differences can be notified. \n\nFor Iribarren values larger than 1.2 no comparison can be made because there is just \n\none picture of a breaking wave for the low geometry.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n85 \n\nIribarren number &lt;0.6 \n\nFor Ir &lt;0.6, no comparison can be made for difference in submergence on the wave \n\nshape. However, for the difference in the length of the reef, the wave for a low reef \n\ngeometry, h_reef is 0.19 m, is better for surfing due to the larger space in the tube. \n\nRegarding the breaker position is, in case of the high geometry and for the same \n\nsubmergence, about 30 to 40 cm more towards the end of the seaward slope of the reef \n\ncompared to the low geometry. Figure 4.10 shows the breaker type for the low and high \n\ngeometries, and a submergence of 0.24 m.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n                      \n \n\nFigure 4.10 - Breaker type for low and high geometries, and for an Iribarren number smaller than 0.6. \n\n \n\n0.6 &lt;Iribarren number &lt;0.8 \n\nFor 0.6 &lt;Ir &lt;0.8, the higher the submergence and the wave height, the better the \n\ntube is for surfing. No significant difference could be notified in the wave shape \n\ncomparing the low and high geometry. It could be notified that in case of the low \n\ngeometry the most waves with a large wave height, that are tested with a large \n\nsubmergence of 0.20 and 0.24 m, break already before the reef starts. Regarding the \n\nbreaker position is in case of the high geometry for the same submergence about 30 to \n\n40 cm more towards the end of the seaward slope of the reef, compared with the low \n\ngeometry.

However, a submergence of 0.12 m \n\nand higher do give a good tube for surfing, also for wave heights of 0.15 m. This means \n\nthat the safety submergence of 1.50 m gives still good breaking waves for surfing. No \n\nsignificant difference could be notified in the wave shape comparing the low and high \n\ngeometry. Regarding the breaker position, again in case of the high geometry for the \n\nsame submergence more towards the end of the seaward slope of the reef compared \n\nwith the low geometry, about 20-30 cm.

About the higher values of the submergences not much can be concluded. \n\nRegarding the breaker position, for the high geometry it is more towards the end of the \n\nseaward slope of the reef, compared with the low geometry. Figure 4.13 shows the \n\nbreaker type for the low and high geometries, and for a submergence of 0.12 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n           \n \nFigure 4.13 - Breaker type for low and high geometries, and for the Iribarren number between 1.0 and 1.2. \n\n4.2.8 PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION  \n\nFrom the physical experiments, it can be concluded that the wave breaks in a \n\nplunging way in most of the cases. The length of the reef does not have an influence at \n\nall in the cases that were tested. However, the submergence has an influence. Most \n\nshapes are good to surf, however for a submergences of 0.08 m the tube of the breaking \n\nwave is not very good for surfing due to a lack of space in the tube. Furthermore it can \n\nbe concluded that a submergence of 1.60 m (prototype scale) gives, in most cases, still a \n\ngood breaking wave for the design wave height of 1.50 m, which means that the safety \n\nsubmergence of 1.50 can give good shape of the breaking waves for surfing. \n\n4.3 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS  \n\nTo get more insight in the breaker type and in the position of breaking simulations \n\nfor the prototype scales and for several heights of the reef, numerical simulations with \n\nCOBRAS-UC (Garcia et al. 2004) were made for several submergences and several \n\nslopes. \n\nThe physical study treated in section 4.2 has shown that the breaker type gets better \n\nwhen the submergence is larger than 0.12 m and when the wave height is larger than \n\nHm = 0.08 m  Tm = 2.52 s  S = 0.12 m   Ir =1.09 \n \n\nHm = 0.13 m  Tm = 3.16 s  S = 0.12 m   Ir = 1.09 \n\nHeight reef = 0.19 m Height reef = 0.36 m \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n88 \n\n0.10 m; it also shows that a submergence of 1.60 m (prototype scale) gives, in most \n\ncases, still a good breaking wave for the design wave height of 1.50 m.  \n\nTo confirm these results, numerical simulations in prototype scale were made for \n\nthree different wave heights and, to confirm the slope of 1:10, several slopes were also \n\ntested with COBRAS-UC. The design wave has a 1.5 m wave height and a period of \n\n9 s, as referred before. These conditions provide the input values for the geometry that \n\nis tested in the 2DH simulations. Numerical simulations were conducted and results are \n\nshown in chapter 6. \n\n4.3.1 NUMERICAL MODEL \n\nBy taking the RANS equations, Liu et al. (1999) presented a two-dimensional, in the \n\nvertical plane, numerical model COBRAS, to describe the flow inside and outside \n\ncoastal structures. Hsu et al. (2002) extended the preliminary model by including a set \n\nof volume-averaged k-? turbulence balance equations. The movement of free surface is \n\ntracked by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. COBRAS-UC is a new version of the \n\nmodel developed at the University of Cantabria in order to overcome some of the initial \n\nlimitations and especially to convert it into a tool for practical application. Most of these \n\nmodifications in the new version COBRAS-UC have been founded on the extensive \n\nvalidation work carried out for low-crested structures (Garcia et al., 2004; Losada et al., \n\n2005, and Lara et al., 2006a) and wave breaking on permeable slopes (Lara et al., \n\n2006b) carried out with the model. The improvements cover the wave generation \n\nprocess; code updating and refactoring; optimization and improvement of the main \n\nsubroutines; improvement of input and output data definition and the development of a \n\ngraphical user interface and output data processing programs, Losada et al. (2008).  \n\n4.3.2 SIMULATIONS \n\n4.3.2.1 THE HEIGHT OF THE REEF \n\nThe height of the reef is the first parameter to be investigated because the first thing \n\nthat has to be known is the length of the reef in order to guarantee that it is enough to \n\nget the wished breaker type. Two reef heights, h_reef (Figure 4.14) have been tested at \n\nfirst: \n\n\u2022 h_reef = 1.90 m, like in the physical experiments,  \n\n\u2022 h_reef = 3.90 m, a little higher than in the physical experiments in order to have a \n\nbroader range of heights.  \n\nAs referred before, the submergence is 1.50 m and the slope of the reef has been chosen \n\n1:10. Figure 4.14 shows the geometry tested and Table 4.4 presents the geometry \n\nparameters and the wave conditions. Linitial is the wavelength at the source. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n89 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.14 - Height of the reef: Geometry tested. \n\n \nTable 4.4 - Height of the reef: Geometry parameters and wave conditions. \n\nh_reef (m) s_reef  S (m) H (m) T (s) \n\n1.90 \n\n3.90 \n1:10 1.50 1.50 9 \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16, it can be seen that with h_reef 1.90 m a spilling \n\nbreak is formed and with a reef height of 3.90 m a plunging break is formed. Since for \n\nsurfing a plunging break is preferred, a third simulation is conducted in order to be able \n\nto see if a plunging break can be got with a smaller height, namely 3.20 m. The results \n\nof the breaker shape are shown in Figure 4.17. \n\nFigure 4.17 shows that still a plunging break is formed with a height of the reef of \n\n3.20 m. Because of that, a height of 3.20 m is chosen as the value for the height of the \n\nreef to use in the 2DH simulations in chapter 6. A height of 3.20 m means a length of \n\nthe reef of 32 m; this value is about half the wavelength at the start of the reef, Lbegin_reef \n(59 m). So a length of the reef of 0.5*Lbegin_reef  is assumed to be the minimal value that \n\nis necessary to form a surfable wave. \n\n \n\n7.50 m \n1:50 \n\ns_reef \n\nS \n\nh_reef \n\nMinimal 1*Linitial \n\nz \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n90 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.15 - Wave shape on the reef with a height of 1.90 m (after 62 s, wave 3). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.16 - Wave shape on the reef with a height of 3.90 m (after 62 s, wave 3). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n91 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.17 - Wave shape on the reef with a height of 3.20 m (after 62 s, wave 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 shows the calculated wave height, Hm, in several points on the reef for all \n\nthree tested reef heights, in prototype scale. Figure 4.19 shows the corresponding values \n\nof the breaker height (Hb), the breaker height divided by the offshore wave height \n\n(Hb/H0) and the breaker parameter Hb/hb. From these two figures, it can be seen that all \n\nbreaker heights Hb and all relations Hb/H0 are almost the same. The breaking point is \n\nlike in the physical experiments more seawards in case of the lower reef. \n\nIt was expected that the higher the reef would be the higher the parameter Hb/hb \n\nwould be, as this value is higher for a relatively large slope than for a relatively small \n\nslope (Komar, 1998), and the large slope is longer experienced when the height of the \n\nreef is larger. Figure 4.19 shows that Hb/hb is significantly larger for the reef with a \n\nheight of 3.20 m than the one with a height of 1.90 m. The value for a reef with a height \n\nof 3.90 m is again somewhat smaller, but not much.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 Investigation of Multi-Functional Artificial Reef Cross-Section Design Parameters  \n\n92 \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310\n\nx (m)\n\nH\nm\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nz\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nh_reef=1.9 m h_reef=3.2 m h_reef=3.9 m\n\n \nFigure 4.18 - Height of the reef: Wave height development on the reef. \n\n \n\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n1.50\n\n2.00\n\n2.50\n\n3.00\n\n1.9 3.2 3.9\n\nh_reef\n\nH\nb\n, \n\nH\nb\n/H\n\n0\n\n1.04\n\n1.06\n\n1.08\n\n1.10\n\n1.12\n\n1.14\n\n1.16\n\n1.18\n\n1.20\n\n H\nb\n/h\n\nb\n\nHb\nHb/Ho\nHb/hb\n\nHb\nHb/H0\nHb/hb\n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 - Influence of h_reef on the values of Hb, Hb/H0 and Hb/hb. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.2 THE SLOPE OF THE REEF \n\nThe slope of the reef, s_reef, is the second parameter that will be investigated, \n\nbecause, by safety reasons, the submergence of the reef is restricted to certain values. \n\nThe geometry and the wave conditions are shown in Figure 4.20 and Table 4.5.

Figure 4.24 shows that a spilling break is formed and tries to \n\nbreak like plunging at first but is not able to. From the results that are shown in Figure \n\n4.21 to Figure 4.24 it can be drawn the conclusion that indeed the wave should \n\nexperience a slope between 1:10 and 1:14, like found in chapter 3. Because of that, a \n\nslope of the three-dimensional reef that will be tested in 2DH (Chapter 6) is 1:10. Figure \n\n4.25 shows the wave height in several points on the reef for all four tested slopes. \n\nFigure 4.26 shows the values of the breaker height (Hb), the breaker height divided by \n\nthe offshore wave height (Hb/H0) and the breaker parameter Hb/hb. From these two \n\nfigures it can be seen that all breaker heights Hb and all relation values of Hb/H0 are \n\nalmost the same.

From the numerical tests, initial \n\nvalues of several parameters for the simulations in 2DH, carried out in chapter 6 \n\n\u2018Optimal geometry of the multi-functional artificial reef\u2019, were determined: the height \n\nof the reef will be 3.20 m, the seaward slope will be 1:10 and the submergence will be \n\nequal to the design wave height of 1.50 m.  \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\n \n \n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n103 \n\n5. NUMERICAL MODEL COULWAVE \n\n5.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe knowledge of the characteristics of the flow associated with currents and surface \n\nwaves, as well as its dependence to the bathymetry and the geometry of the coast, is \n\nimportant in the design of coastal protection structures like groins, breakwaters and \n\nartificial reefs. \n\nUntil around 1980 linear models were used to simulate the effect of refraction \n\nproduced by the variation of the depth in the direction of the propagation of the wave \n\nand to simulate the effect of diffraction produced by the gradient of the amplitude along \n\nthe crest of the wave. However, as they are based on the linear theory, those models \n\nshould not be used in shallow water. \n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the possibility of using more complete and \n\ncomplex mathematical models nowadays. Not only did our theoretical knowledge of the \n\ninvolved physical phenomena evolved, but also the numerical methods are used more \n\nefficiently nowadays. Above all, since the beginning of the 1980s, a significant growth \n\nof the processing capacities and storage of great volumes of information took place. \n\nIn the first phase the models of the Saint-Venant type were mostly used. However, in \n\nshallow water conditions and for certain types of waves, models based on non-\n\ndispersive theories, of which the model of the Saint-Venant is an example, are limited. \n\nThey do, in general, not give good results for long periods of analysis. Besides that in \n\nreal applications, it is important to have in consideration the effects of the gravity \n\nwaves, inclusive the processes of refraction, diffraction, reflection, swelling and \n\nbreaking of the waves, as well as the wave-wave and wave-current interaction \n\nprocesses. The models of the Saint-Venant are limited and are not usually able to \n\ncompute satisfactory results over long periods of analysis. \nOnly models of order 2\u00b5  ( \u00b5 = wavenumber times depth (kh), in which h is the water \n\ndepth and k = 2?/L, is the wavenumber, being L the wavelength) or greater, of the \n\nBoussinesq or Serre types, are capable to reproduce the nonlinear and dispersive effects \n\nresultanting from the propagation of waves in shallow water conditions with enough \n\naccuracy. The conventional Boussinesq equations (Peregrine, 1967), which make use of \n\na quadratic polynomial approximation for the vertical flow distribution, have two major \n\nconstraints: (1) The depth-averaged model poorly describes the frequency dispersion of \n\nwave propagation in intermediate depths, and (2) the weakly nonlinear assumption \n\nlimits the largest wave height that can accurately be modeled. These constraints are \n\nconsistent with the fundamental assumption of the Boussinesq equations, which states \n\nthat leading order dispersion and nonlinear effects are of the same order and are weak, \n\ni.e., ( ) ( )020 ?\u00b5 OO = &lt;&lt;1, with 0?  = amplitude over depth (a/h). The dispersive \nproperties of the conventional Boussinesq equations have been improved by modifying \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n104 \n\nthe dispersive terms (Madsen et al.,1992) or using a reference velocity at a specified \n\ndepth (Nwogu, 1993). These techniques yield a set of equations whose linear dispersion \n\nrelation can be adjusted such that the resulting intermediate-depth dispersion \n\ncharacteristics are close to those of linear wave theory. Liu (1994) and Wei et al. (1995) \n\nextended Nwogu\u2019s approach to highly nonlinear waves, developing models that not \n\nonly can be applied to intermediate water depth but also are capable of simulating wave \npropagation with strong nonlinear interaction, i.e. ( )10 O=? . In general, these \nmathematical model contain accurate linear dispersion properties to kh ? 3. In \n\nintermediate depths, nonlinear properties tend to exhibit larger relative errors than linear \n\nproperties (Madsen et al., 1998), although additional enhancements can indeed create \n\naccurate nonlinear characteristics to near the linear accuracy limit, kh ? 3 (Kennedy et \n\nal., 2000). Further enhancing the deep water accuracy of the depth-integrated approach \n\nis the so-called high-order Boussinesq-type equations. These high-order models use \n\nfourth, and higher, order polynomial approximations. Gobbi et al. (2000) used a fourth-\n\norder polynomial and developed a model with excellent linear dispersive properties up \n\nto kh ? 6. Nonlinear behavior was faithfully captured to kh ? 3. With the drastic \n\nimprovement in accuracy over previous model equations comes a significant \n\ncomputational increase as well. The fourth-order polynomial employed results in fifth-\n\norder spatial derivatives in an extremely complex equation system, requiring an equally \n\ncomplex numerical scheme. Madsen et al. (1998) and Agnon et al. (1999) derived \n\nmodel equations with even higher order polynomial approximations. The highest order \n\nof spatial differentiation in these model equations increases linearly with the order of \n\nthe polynomial approximation. Additionally, the complexity increases again for a two-\n\nhorizontal dimension (2HD) problem, for which no high-order modeling attempts have \n\nyet been made.  \n\nAll these developments have the objective to extend the application of classical \n\nBoussinesq type models to the propagation of waves from intermediate waters till the \n\nbreaking zone. In this thesis, the Boussinesq-type model COULWAVE is used. This \n\nmodel uses, for relative high kh numbers, a different approach to obtain a high-order \n\nspatial approximation for the vertical distribution of the flow field; two quadratic \n\npolynomials are used, matched at an interface that divides the water column in two \n\nlayers.  \n\nThe model consists of a set of equations, derived by piecewise integration of the \n\nprimitive equations of motion through an arbitrary number, N, of layers. Within each \n\nlayer, an independent velocity profile is determined. With N separate velocity profiles, \n\nmatched at the arbitrary interface of the layers, the resulting set of equations will have \n\n2N-1 free parameters, allowing for an optimization with known analytical properties of \n\nwater waves. The one-layer model is equivalent to the well-studied \u201cextended\u201d \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n105 \n\nBoussinesq model, which is accurate up to kh = 3. The optimized two-layer model \n\nshows good linear behavior up to a kh of 8, while second-order nonlinear behavior is \n\nwell-captured to kh values near 6.  \n\nThe multi-layer concept has been attempted previously by Kanayama et al. (1998), \n\nalthough the derivation and final model equations are quite different from those used in \n\nCOULWAVE. Green &amp; Naghdi\u2019s (1976) approach is often termed \u201cdirected fluid \n\nsheets\u201d, however there is also little similarity to the method used in COULWAVE. \n\nTheir approach employs an arbitrary number of vertical shape functions to describe the \n\nvertical profile of the flow field. All of the shape functions exist throughout the entire \n\nwater column, which is different from the piecemeal matching of vertical profile \n\nsegments done in COULWAVE. Internal and stratified flow modelers often employ a \n\nmulti-layering concept, although the layers are always layers of different density and \n\nthus represent a different physical problem than the one used in COULWAVE. See \n\nLynett et al. (2002) about details of the multi-layer used in the model.. \n\nA high-order, predictor-corrector, finite-difference numerical algorithm is developed \n\nfor the one- and two-layer models. Included in the numerical code is a parameterization \n\nof bottom friction and wave breaking (see section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2), as well as a moving \n\nboundary scheme to simulate wave runup and rundown (see section 5.4.3). \n\nConsidering one layer only, the corresponding mathematical and numerical models \n\nthat are the base of the model COULWAVE are presented in section 5.2 and 5.3.

The weakly nonlinear version of (1) and (2) (i.e. assuming \n\nO(?) = ?(\u00b52), thereby neglecting all nonlinear dispersive terms) was first derived by \nNwogu (1993).  \n\nNwogu, through linear and first-order nonlinear analysis of the equation model, \n\nrecommended that z1 = -0.531h, and that value has been adopted by other researchers \n\nusing these equations. Nwogu\u2019s model was extended to \u201cfull nonlinearity\u201d by Liu \n\n(1994) and Wei et al. (1995).  There are some discrepancies between Liu\u2019s and Wei &amp; \n\nKirby\u2019s derived equations, which can be attributed to a neglect of some nonlinear \n\ndispersive terms in Wei &amp; Kirby (Hsaio &amp; Liu, 2002). The above one-layer equations \n\n(1) and (2) are identical to those derived by Liu (1994).  \n\n \n\n5.3 NUMERICAL MODEL FOR ONE-LAYER \n\nA finite difference algorithm is used for the general one- and two-layer model \n\nequations. The structure of the present numerical model is similar to those of Wei &amp; \n\nKirby (1995) and Wei et al. (1995). Differences between the model presented here, for \n\nthe one-layer system, and that of Wei et al. exist in the added terms due to a time-\n\ndependant water depth and the numerical treatment of some nonlinear dispersive terms. \n\nThe equations are solved utilizing a high-order predictor-corrector scheme, employing a \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n107 \n\nthird order in time explicit Adams-Bashforth predictor step, and a fourth order in time \n\nAdams-Moulton implicit corrector step (Press et al., 1989). The implicit corrector step \n\nmust be iterated until a convergence criterion is satisfied. The equations (1) and (2) are \n\ndimensionalised for the numerical model, the dimensional equations are equivalent to \nthe non-dimensional ones with 1== \u00b5?  and the addition of gravity, g , to the \ncoefficient of the leading order free surface derivative in the momentum equation.  \n\n \n\nTo simplify the predictor-corrector equations, the velocity time derivatives in the \n\nmomentum equations are grouped into the dimensional form: \n\n( )( ) ( )[ ]xxxxxxx huuhuku\nk\n\nuU +??+\n?\n\n+=  \n22\n\n2\n???\n\n?\n         (3) \n\n( )( ) ( )[ ]yyyyyyy hvvhvkvkvV +??+?+=  \n22\n\n2\n???\n\n?\n          (4) \n\nwhere subscripts denote partial derivatives.

The \n\nevaluation of these two additional terms are discussed in 5.4.1 and 5.4.2. \n\n5.4.1 BOTTOM FRICTION \n \nBottom friction is described in the quadratic form: \n \n\n||\nH\n\nf\nbbf uu=R        (14) \n\nwhere f  is a bottom friction coefficient, typically in the range of 10-3 to 10-2 (e.g. \n\nWhitfor and Thorton, 1996; Kobayashi et al., 1997), depending on the Reynolds \nnumber and seafloor condition, H = h + ? is the total water depth, and bu  is the \n\nhorizontal velocity at the seafloor. \n\nThe above expression (14) has been utilized in similar models (e.g. Chen et al., \n\n1999) and has a direct correlation to the Chezy coefficient, C. This relationship is: \n\n \n\n2C\n\ng\nf =         (15) \n\n \n\nwhere g is gravity.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n110 \n\n5.4.2 WAVE BREAKING MODEL \n\nOne of the most significant obstacles in the way of developing a practical numerical \n\nmodel with depth-integrated equations is wave breaking. There exist three reasons that \n\nconstitute major problems with wave breaking in depth-integrated models (Lynett, \n\n2002): \n\n\u2022 A depth-integrated model, by definition, can only have a single elevation value of the \n\nwater-air interface at any horizontal coordinate, and thus phenomena such as wave \n\noverturning cannot be simulated.  \n\n\u2022 Along the same lines, very strong horizontal vorticity typically accompanies \n\nbreaking, which an irrotational or weakly rotational model will not capture.  \n\n\u2022 Most depth-integrated derivations use as an initial assumption inviscid flow (those in \n\nthis thesis included), and therefore do not have any means to dissipate energy.  \n\n \n\nThe first reason given, that of the impossibility of simulating wave-overturning, is \n\nthe only unapproachable one of the three. Thus, it will always be necessary to \n\nparameterize the large-scale features of wave breaking when using depth-integrated \n\nequations. Two distinct approaches to simulating the effects of wave breaking with \n\ndepth integrated models exist: numerical dissipation and ad-hoc addition of dissipative \n\nterms to the momentum equation. Numerical dissipative approaches most notably \n\ninclude shock capturing schemes. In these schemes, energy dissipation is related to the \n\nlocal smoothness of the solution, which is of course strongly related to the gridlength \n\nnear the shock. Most recently, Li and Raichlen (2002) used the weighted essentially \n\nnon-oscillatory shock capturing scheme, adapted from gas dynamics research, to model \n\nsolitary wave run-up. The results presented in Li and Raichlen are excellent, among the \n\nbest numerical-experimental comparisons to date. With shock capturing methods, the \n\nnumerical results tend to be very smooth. However, the dissipation is entirely \n\nnumerical, and although the general form of the dissipative terms may be of the proper \n\nphysical form, the dissipation will inevitable be related to the grid length and time step. \n\nUtilizing post-derivation-added dissipation terms to the momentum equation removes \n\nthis dissipative dependence on numerical parameters. However, these added terms are \n\nad-hoc terms, and will contain coefficients that must be obtained based on comparison \n\nwith experiment. Whether the numerical or ad-hoc approach is more desirable will \n\ndepend entirely on the individual preference of the researcher. In this thesis, the addition \n\nof ad-hoc dissipation terms is employed, as it is of simple implementation and efficient \n\nto avoid numerical dissipative and dispersive enhancements/errors whenever possible. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n111 \n\nBreaking Scheme and Validation \n\nThe breaking scheme employed in this work closely follows the scheme presented in \n\nKennedy et al. (2000). Description of this particular breaking scheme can also be found \n\nin Chen et al. (2000), which is a companion paper to Kennedy et al. The scheme is \n\ndeveloped from an \u201deddy viscosity\u201d approach, where a user defined formulation for an \n\neddy viscosity is developed based on agreement with experimental data. The eddy \nviscosity is part of a momentum conserving ad-hoc dissipative term ji bybxb RR +=R . \n\nbxR  and byR  are computed by (see also Lynett, 2002): \n\n \n\n( )[ ] ( ) ( )[ ]\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n? ++=\n\nyxyxxbx\nvHuHuH\n\nH\nR 111    \n\n2\n\n11\n???

(2000) and the \n\nmodel used in COULWAVE, see Lynett (2002). \n\n5.4.3 SIMULATING WAVE RUNUP &amp; RUNDOWN \n\nWave propagation using depth-integrated equations is now well simulated and \n\nunderstood, but the process of runup and rundown is not. Shoreline boundaries may \n\nmove significantly under the temporal influence of incident waves. A numerical model \n\nshould be able to take into account such variations correctly in order to obtain realistic \n\nflow patterns. Researchers generally use a fixed grid, finite differences or finite \n\nelements methods to solve depth-integrated equations. Using a fixed grid numerical \n\nmodel to solve a moving boundary problem can lead to difficulties related to the loss of \n\nmass conservation and instabilities in the computations (Leendertse, 1987) as a result of \n\nimposing discrete fixed increments to the extent of wetting and drying areas (Balzano, \n\n1998). To reduce the computational instabilities near the wet-dry interface, some \n\nresearchers added bottom friction into the momentum equations. However, a numerical \n\nmodel should be stable even without using bottom friction dissipation. Zelt (1991) used \n\na Lagrangian form of the Boussinesq equations to simulate shoreline movement. This \n\nmodel produced maximum runup values that compared well with experimental values, \n\nbut the shape of the wave as it traveled up the slope did not compare as favorably. A \n\nhandful of others have utilized Lagragian techniques with depth-integrated equation \n\nmodels to simulate a moving shoreline (e.g., Petera and Nassehi, 1996; Gopalakrishnan, \n\n1989). Another treatment of moving boundary problem is employing a slot or \n\npermeable-seabed technique (Tao, 1983). The first application of the permeable slot \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n112 \n\nwith a Boussinesq-type model (Madsen et al., 1997) yielded runup errors on the order \n\nof ten percent of the maximum. Modifications have been made to this permeable slot \n\ntechnique (Kennedy et al., 2000), increasing the accuracy, but it was also shown that the \n\nempirical coefficients that govern the technique can not be universally determined, due \n\nto numerical stability problems (Chen et al., 2000). In this section, a new moving \n\nboundary treatment for wave propagation models is presented. The moving boundary \n\nalgorithm is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and can be employed by different \n\nnumerical schemes (i.e., finite differences and finite elements) utilizing depth-integrated \n\nequations. The moving boundary technique utilizes linear extrapolation near the wet-dry \n\nboundary, thereby allowing the real boundary location to exist in-between nodal points.  \n\nSee further Lynett (2002). \n\n \n\nMoving Boundary Algorithm \n\nThe development of the moving boundary algorithm presented began with a search \n\nfor a scheme that allows for the wet-dry boundary to exist at any location, not \n\nrestrictively at a node on a fixed grid (Lynett, 2002). One method of achieving this is \n\nthrough dynamic regridding, using a Lagrangian approach. Methods such as this have \n\nbeen used in finite difference and finite element nonlinear shallow water (NLSW) and \n\nBoussinesq equation models (e.g., Petera and Nasshei, 1996; Zelt, 1991). Lagrangian \n\nmoving boundary techniques require numerical flexibility, in terms of utilizing \n\nconstantly changing space and time steps, to be implemented in conjunction with a \n\nEulerian-type model. This flexibility is not present in the current numerical scheme, and \n\nis difficult to achieve due to the nature of the required high-order derivatives, and so a \n\ndifferent approach is developed. Owing to the significant number of derivatives \n\ncalculated by the one-layer numerical model (~50 in 2DH), it would be advantageous if \n\nthe moving boundary scheme did not require any sort of special treatment of the \n\nderivatives near the wet-dry boundary (i.e., forward, backward, or low order finite \n\ndifferences). To require, for example, directional differences at the boundary leads to \n\nabundant conditional statements, making the programming tedious and the runtime \n\nlonger. Therefore, the five-point centered finite differences that are employed in the \n\nnumerical model are desired to be used at all locations, including those points near the \n\nshoreline, where neighboring nodes may be dry. With this in mind, the moving \n\nboundary scheme will employ a linear extrapolation of free surface displacement, ?, and \nvelocity components, u1 and v1, from the fluid domain, through the wet-dry boundary \n\nand into the dry region. Kowalik and Bang (1987) presented a similar approach of \n\nemploying a linear extrapolation into the dry region, based on Sielecki and Wurtele\u2019s \n\n(1970) earlier developments. Their model uses a leap-frog scheme to approximate the \n\nNonlinear Shallow-Water Wave (NLSW) equations, and is limited to one-dimensional, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n113 \n\nnon-breaking problems. Lynett (2002) extended this idea to two horizontal dimension \n\nbreaking problems, using a high-order numerical model. An extrapolation through the \n\nwet-dry boundary permits this boundary to exist in-between nodal points. Figure 5.1 \n\ngives a numerical example of how the extrapolation is performed in a one-dimensional \n\nproblem, showing a solitary wave interacting with a 1:20 slope. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.1 - Runup and rundown of a solitary wave, where extrapolated nodes are shown by the dots \n\n(Lynett, 2002). \n\n \n\nThe free surface locations that are determined using the one-layer governing \n\nequations, (1) and (2), are shown by the solid line, whereas the linearly extrapolated \n\npoints are shown by the dots. With extrapolated values of ? and velocity components in \nthe dry region, solving the model equations at wet nodes can proceed. When solving the \n\nmodel equations, five-point centered differences are employed to approximate the \n\nspatial derivatives. Although no derivatives are calculated at dry (extrapolated) points, \n\nthe physical values of free surface and velocity at these points are used to evaluate \n\nderivatives at neighboring wet-points. The determination of the location of the wet-dry \n\nboundary is performed once per time step, immediately after the predictor step. The \n\nmoving boundary technique is numerically stable, and does not require any additional \n\ndissipative mechanisms. See further Lynett (2002). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n114 \n\n5.5 LABORATORY DATA  \n\nFor both section 5.6, the comparison between the serial and the parallel version, and \n\nsection 5.7, the calibration, the experimental results of Poort (2007) are used.

For large scale problems, it is either not affordable or practical \n\nto run on a single PC. To facilitate such extensive computations, a parallel \n\nCOULWAVE model was developed by Sitanggang and Lynett (2005) using the domain \n\ndecomposition technique in conjunction with the message passing interface (MPI). The \n\npublished and well-tested numerical scheme used by the serial model, a high-order \n\nfinite difference method, is identical to that employed in the parallel model. \n\nParallelization of the three-diagonal matrix systems included in the serial scheme is the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n115 \n\nmost challenging aspect of the work, and is accomplished using a parallel matrix solver \n\ncombined with an efficient data transfer scheme. Numerical tests on a distributed-\n\nmemory supercomputer showed that the performance of the current parallel model in \n\nsimulating wave evolution is very satisfactory. A linear speedup is gained as the number \n\nof processors increases. The tests showed that the CPU time efficiency of the model is \n\nabout 75-90% (Sitanggang and Lynett, 2005). COULWAVE is parallelized using the \n\ndomain decomposition method, where each processor performs the same operations. \n\nThe parallel algorithm is identical to its serial counterpart, based on an iterative \n\npredictor-corrector scheme also requiring a three-diagonal solution for each iteration. \n\nThe model test indicates that both the validity and the performance of the model are \n\nexcellent. However, the performance of the model may be further improved if a more \n\nefficient parallel three-diagonal solver is employed. Success at parallelizing \n\nCOULWAVE will allow for large domain simulation which is not possible to run on a \n\nsingle PC due to limited memory size and large computation time. This parallel model \n\nprovides the future opportunity for large wave-resolving simulations in the nearshore, \n\nwith global domains of many million of grid points, covering O (100 km2) and greater \n\nbasins. Additionally, real-time simulation with Boussinesq equations becomes a \n\npossibility. \n\n5.6.2 APPLICATION OF BOTH THE SERIAL AND PARALLEL VERSIONS \n\nThe input that one has to give to the program is in both the serial and the parallel \n\nversions almost the same. In both versions the input grid is interpolated by the program \n\ndepending of the number of grid points per wavelength that is given as an input. The \n\ngrid that the program uses is always regular, in the whole domain. The time step is \n\ncalculated by the value given for the Courant number as an input. The Courant number \n\nrC  should always be smaller than 0.5, which is given by: \n\n \n\ngh\ndx\n\ndt\nCr =        (5.1) \n\nWhen the option of inserting an internal source is used, the location of the source \n\nshould be given from the right boundary of the sponge layer. Regarding the wave \n\ngauges that record the surface elevation and the velocities in x and y directions at every \n\ntime step, the position that has to be given is different in the serial and the parallel \n\nversion. In the parallel version the position of the wave gauges has to be given as the \n\ndistance from the right boundary of the sponge layer, where, the left boundary of the \n\nsponge layer is the left boundary of the grid. In the serial version the position of the \n\nwave gauges have also to be given from the right boundary of the sponge layer, \n\nhowever in this version this is the left boundary of the input grid.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n116 \n\nIn order to compare these two versions regarding the needed CPU time simulations \n\nfor the geometry in a basin, which will be used for the calibration of COULWAVE in \n\nthis chapter, have been made. The bathymetries for the serial version and for the parallel \n\nversion are not exactly the same, because in the serial version the sponge layers are \n\nadded by the model to the input grid and in the parallel version the sponge layers are put \n\nin the input grid by the model. The bathymetry for the parallel version is schematically \n\nshown in Figure 5.3 and the bathymetry for the serial version in Figure 5.4. The \n\nbathymetry for the parallel version is wider, namely 2 times the width of the sponge \n\nlayer, one layer at the right and one at the left side. Besides that, the grid for the parallel \n\nversion is five cells larger around all boundaries, because the five last grid cells at all \n\nboundaries of the grid that one uses as input in the program are used as ghost boundary \n\ncells to enforce the boundary conditions. The physical wall is put inside these ghost \n\nboundary cells. In the serial version this is not the case. More information about the \n\nformation of the grid is given in section 5.7.2.  \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 5.3 - Cross-section A-A in Figure 5.2 for parallel version. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.4 - Cross-section A-A in for serial version. \n\n \n\nThe conditions in the simulations are the same as in the laboratory data of M. Poort \n\n(2007), section 5.4). The sponge layer has a width of 1.25 times the smallest \n\nwavelength, so this is 4.93 m. The grid size is 0.1975 m, so the 5 ghost cells are together \n\n0.9875 m.  \n\nFor this thesis a workstation has been used for the simulations. The characteristics of \n\nthe workstation are CPU \u2013 Dual Core AMD Opteron 265 (4 processors), memory \u2013 8 \n\nGb, SPECfp_rate2000 = 54.7.

It has \n\nappeared that in the workstation no division in the x-direction could be made (Figure \n\n5.5). Therefore only divisions in the y-direction have been made, like demonstrated in \n\nFigure 5.5 (right). \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Division in x-direction (left), in both directions (middle) and in in y-direction (right), Pr = \nprocessor. \n\n \nTable 5.1 - CPU time needed with both the serial and parallel versions. \n\n CPU time needed  \n\nSerial version 4 hours, 37 min  \n\nParallel version \u2013 1 processor 4 hours, 55 min \n\nParallel version \u2013 2 processors 2 hours, 33 min  \n\nParallel version \u2013 3 processors 1 hour, 55 min \n\n \n\nAs can be seen in Table 5.1 the serial version and the parallel version with one \n\nprocessor need around the same amount of CPU time, and it can also be seen that the \n\nmore the grid is divided in the parallel version the less CPU time is needed. Due to the \n\nfact that the parallel version is the most recent version of the code of COULWAVE, it \n\nwas decided to use the parallel version. Mostly 2 to 3 processors were available to run \n\nsimulations in the workstation. Table 5.1 shows that it is more interesting to run 3 \n\ndifferent simulations at the same time, each one using 1 processor (total time 5 hours), \n\nthan to run 3 simulations in sequence with 3 processors (total time 6 hours). Because of \n\nthat, the choice was made to use for the simulations the parallel version without \n\ndivision.   \n\n5.7 CALIBRATION  \n\nThe influence of relevant parameters on wave propagation and breaking will be \n\ninvestigated for the significant wave height. The wave height in different points of the \n\ndomain for several values of the relevant parameters will be compared with the wave \n\nheight obtained in the laboratory. As significant wave height is not totally appropriate to \n\nanalyze a bi-chromatic wave, the spectra will be also compared. \n\nIn the parameterizations of the model several parameters can be varied: \n\nx \n\ny \n\nno output of model no output of model model gives output \n\nPr 1 Pr 2 Pr 3 Pr 4 Pr 1 \n\nPr 2 \n\nPr 3 \n\nPr 4 \n\nPr 1 \n\nPr 2 \nPr 3 \nPr 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n118 \n\nI. Bottom friction (see section 5.4.1). Even thought that is written in section 5.4.1 that \n\nthis parameter typically ranges between 10-3 and 10-2, in the model the parameter can \n\nbe varied between 10-4 and 10-2. \n\nII. Fraction of upwinded differences composing convective terms. Value 0 means no \n\nupwinding and 1 means fully upwinding. Upwind schemes use an adaptive or \n\nsolution-sensitive finite difference stencil to numerically simulate more properly the \n\ndirection of propagation of information in a flow field. The upwind schemes attempt \n\nto discretize hyperbolic partial differential equations by using differencing biased in \n\nthe direction determined by the sign of the characteristic speeds. \n\nIII. Yes or no implementing of a wave breaking model (see section 5.4.2). When the \n\nwave breaking model is implemented, five parameters in the code of the model can \n\nbe changed. These parameters are treated in section 5.7.3.  \n\nBesides that, an analysis will be done on the influence of the input bathymetry and of \n\nthe grid on the model results. \n\n5.7.1 BATHYMETRY  \n\nA comparison of the bathymetry has been made before and after running the \n\nprogram. Both options smoothing and not smoothing have been selected in two different \n\nsimulations. Figure 5.6 shows the bathymetry before and after running the program for \n\ntwo values of y (see also Figure 5.2 for the location of this y-value). The changes in the \n\nbathymetry are considered to be unacceptable, as the wave height is 0.04 m and the \n\ndifference in submergence at the offshore side of the reef is about 0.02 m. Because of \n\nthat the option \u2018not smoothing\u2019 is chosen. It appeared no stability problems were created \n\ndue to this choice. \n\n \n\n-0,45\n-0,4\n\n-0,35\n-0,3\n\n-0,25\n-0,2\n\n-0,15\n-0,1\n\n-0,05\n0\n\n10 12 14 16 18 20\n\nx (m)\n\nz\n (\n\nm\n)\n\ny=13.8 m (before run)\n\ny=13.8 m (after run)\n\ny=13.4 m (before run)\n\ny=13.4 m (after run)\n\n \nFigure 5.6 - Bathymetry comparisons with and without smoothing option. \n\n5.7.2 GRID MODEL \n\nIn the physical experiments (Poort, 2007), the x-dimension of the basin is 25 m (see \n\nFigure 5.2) and at x = 0 in the basin three piston wave makers, generating uni-\n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n119 \n\ndirectional shore normal incident waves, were placed in one line and were linked to \n\noperate synchronously. For the wave maker there was a second-order wave paddle \n\nsteering system with no reflection compensation. Behind the wave maker porous rocks \n\nwere present to diminish reflection of the generated waves.  \n\nFor the numerical simulations a grid was created with the source at x = 10 m, so the \n\ntotal x-dimension of the grid is 35 m (Figure 5.7). The source was situated at x = 10 m \n\nin order to have space at the left side of the source for the sponge layer ( L. \u00d7251 ) and \nfor the wave generation ( L. \u00d701 ).  \n\nFor this calibration it is important to simulate the exact dimensions of the basin  as \n\nthe reef was positioned at one side of the basin against the wall. In order to obtain the \n\nsimulations with the exact dimensions, the input bathymetry domain was made \n\nartificially 5 cells larger at the side boundaries due to the five ghost cells. One grid cell \n\nhas a dimension of 0.1975 m, so at both sides about 1.0 m was added in the input grid. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.7 - Bathymetry for simulations with COULWAVE. \n\n \n\nThe greater the number of points per wavelength more stable the simulation is. The \n\ngrid size is determined by dividing the minimum wavelength to the number of grid \n\npoints. The width of the boundary layer is calculated by 1.25 times the wavelength of \n\nthe first wavelength that is given as input. In Table 5.2 the estimated CPU time needed \n\nis given for several numbers of grid points per wavelengths. The time is rounded to \n\nwhole hours. The other parameters are all the same.  \n \n\nTable 5.2 - Comparison of CPU time needed for several numbers of grid points per wavelength. \n\nNumber of gridpoints per \nwavelength \n\nCPU time needed \n\n20 5 hours \n30 17 hours \n40 39 hours \n50 80 hours \n60 190 hours \n70 Program doesn\u2019t run \n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nm\n\nsource \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n120 \n\nTable 5.2 shows the characteristics of the simulation.

This gauge was \n\nchosen, due to its good position to study the influence of the several wave propagation \n\nparameters. The acquisition of the surface elevation in the laboratory was done with a \n\nfrequency of 100 Hz. The value of the significant wave height obtained in the laboratory \n\nin this gauge is 0.074 m for the gauge shown in Figure 5.8. For this investigation on the \n\ninfluence of the parameters the one-layer option of the model was selected.  \n\n \n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n \nFigure 5.8 - Wave gauge location to investigate the parameters influence. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n121 \n\nPreliminary results \n\nBefore starting with the investigation of the influence of the parameters, time series \n\nand spectrums of the surface elevation and of the velocity in the x-direction measured in \n\nlaboratory are compared with results of COULWAVE. As a first approximation, \n\nsimulations were conducted with an eddy viscosity of 0.5, a bottom friction coefficient \n\nof 0.01 and an upwind fraction coefficient of 1. In laboratory, the velocity was \n\nmeasured at 0.5 times the water depth; in the model, the velocity is obtained at z = -\n\n0.531*h. Figure 5.9 compares time series of the surface elevation simulated by \n\nCOULWAVE with laboratory data. As can be seen, the time series are very close. \n\nFigure 5.10 compares the spectrum of these time series. This figure shows that the \n\nspectrum is very close. A small difference is that the peaks at both periods are more \n\nnarrow and higher in the laboratory measurements. However, the position and the \n\nenergy of the superharmonics is almost the same. \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 5.9 - Laboratory and Coulwave time series of surface elevation. \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.10 - Spectrum of time series shown in Figure 5.9. \n\n \n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\nfrequency (Hz)\n\nam\npl\n\nit\nu\n\nd\ne \n\n(m\n)\n\n            = laboratory \n            = COULWAVE \n\n240 250 260 270 280 290 300\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\ntime (s)\n\ns\nu\nrf\n\na\nc\ne\n e\n\nle\nv\na\nti\no\nn\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n            = laboratory \n            = Coulwave \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n122 \n\nFigure 5.11 shows time series comparisons between velocity results of COULWAVE \n\nand laboratory data in the x-direction.

From Figure 5.12 it can be seen that the significant wave \n\nheights for the several values of the bottom friction in COULWAVE are very close. \n\nFigure 5.13 to Figure 5.16 can be seen that the energy spectra of COULWAVE are also \n\nalmost the same. As can be seen, the energy spectra from the laboratory and from \n\nCOULWAVE model are similar for all values of the bottom friction with the energy \n\npeaks exist at the same frequencies. The only difference is that the energy peak of the \n\nsmallest frequency is little narrower and higher than as in the laboratory.  Because the \n\nresults are so close, the default value of 0.01 is chosen for the bottom friction for further \n\nsimulations. \n\n \n\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nf [Hz]\n\nS\n(f\n\n) \n[m\n\n2\n/s\n\n]\n\nspect rum_lab\n\nspect rum_coulwave\n\n \nFigure 5.13 - Energy spectrum for bottom friction 0.0001. \n\n \n\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nf [Hz]\n\nS\n(f\n\n) \n[m\n\n2\n/s\n\n]\n\nspect rum_lab\n\nspect rum_coulwave\n\n \nFigure 5.14 - Energy spectrum for bottom friction 0.001. \n\n \n\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nf [Hz]\n\nS\n(f\n\n) \n[m\n\n2\n/s\n\n]\n\nspect rum_lab\n\nspect rum_coulwave\n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 Numerical Model COULWAVE  \n\n124 \n\nFigure 5.15 - Energy spectrum for bottom friction 0.005. \n\n \n\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nf [Hz]\n\nS\n(f\n\n) \n[m\n\n2\n/s\n\n]\n\nspect rum_lab\n\nspect rum_coulwave\n\n \nFigure 5.16 - Energy spectrum for bottom friction 0.01. \n\n \n\nII.

As in the \n\nvariation of the bottom friction, also energy spectra of COULWAVE for the different \n\nvalues of the upwind fraction are very close to the spectra obtained for the laboratory \n\nresults. The same pattern in the energy spectrum of COULWAVE compared with the \n\nlaboratory can be seen as with the bottom friction. As the results are so close, the most \n\nstable option for the upwind fraction and the one that presented the closest agreement \n\nwith the experimental data, namely 1, is chosen for further simulations. \n\n \n\nIII. Breaking model \n\nIn the breaking module of the code four parameters can be changed; dzdt_I, dzdt_F, \n\nT_star and delta_breaking.

Only case 2 gave slightly different \n\nresults. As can be seen, the results of cases 1 and 2 are very close till 27 m; after this \n\ndistance the gauges from the laboratory give slightly higher wave heights.

The energy spectrum and the influences of the breaking \n\nparameters on the significant wave height were also studied. It can be concluded that the \n\ndefault values of all investigated parameters give very similar results with the laboratory \n\ndata of a flow around a submerged reef in a wave basin (Poort, 2007). Because of that, it \n\nwas chosen to set all investigated parameters on the default values for the simulations \n\ncarried out to investigate the design parameters of the MFAR. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 Optimal Geometry of the Multi-\nFunctional Artificial Reef \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n131 \n\n6. OPTIMAL GEOMETRY OF THE MULTI-FUNCTIONAL \nARTIFICIAL REEF \n\n6.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nIn this chapter the optimal geometry will be designed for the conditions at the west \n\ncoast of Portugal, especially the local coastline in front of Leirosa. The optimal \n\ngeometry is investigated for a reef that will be good for amateur surfers (skill 3-6, see \n\nchapter 2), but that will be as interesting as possible for professionals too, so that \n\nchampionships may eventually be an option. Because of that the peel angle is between \n\n40 and 60 degrees and the breaker type is at the transition of spilling and plunging (with \n\nrelatively low values of ?b). \n\nIn chapter 3 six parameters of an MFAR have been mentioned that have to be \n\ndefined for an optimal geometry: \n\n\u2022 reef angle; \n\n\u2022 height of the reef; \n\n\u2022 geometry of the reef (with or without a platform); \n\n\u2022 submergence of the reef; \n\n\u2022 horizontal dimensions; \n\n\u2022 side slope of the reef. \n\n \n\nIn chapter 5 three parameters, namely the height of the reef, the submergence of the \n\nreef and the seaward slope of the reef have been investigated and determined; the values \n\nare summarized in Table 6.1.  \n \n\nTable 6.1- Geometry parameters defined previously (see chapter 5). \n\nHeight of the reef 3.20 m \n\nSide slope of the reef 1:10 \n\nSubmergence of the reef 1.50 m \n\n \n\nThis chapter treats the investigation of the parameters mentioned before (see chapter \n\n4 that have a behavior in 2DH (x,y), namely: \n\n\u2022 the reef angle; \n\n\u2022 the geometry of the reef (with or without a platform); \n\n\u2022 horizontal dimensions. \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate these parameters, simulations are executed with the calibrated \n\nCOULWAVE model (see chapter 5). The simulations are executed with regular waves \n\nand the incident angle of the waves is chosen to be zero degrees, since the point of the \n\ncrest will be directed toward the most common wave direction, giving the best surfing \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n132 \n\nconditions. As the reef will be designed with two goals, namely coastal protection and \n\nthe increase of surfing possibilities, two wave conditions will be tested:  \n\n\u2022 Design condition for coastal protection (storm condition): H = 4.0 m, T =15 s. \n\n\u2022 Design condition for surfing (common condition): H = 1.5 m, T = 9 s. \n\n \n\nAs it is expected that the reef angle, the eventual presence of a platform and the \n\nhorizontal dimensions interact with each other, it is decided to make the simulations \n\nwith variations of the reef angle considering a reef with a platform and without a \n\nplatform. The horizontal dimensions vary automatically with the variation of the reef \n\nangle and the use or not use of a platform. \n\nLike mentioned in chapter 4, the reef angle gives highest peel angles for 66 degrees. \n\nHowever, in the determination of 66 degrees 2DH effects of wave focusing are not \n\ntaken into account. Besides that, with a lower reef angle more local shoreline is \n\nprotected. Consequently, in this section, two reef angles are tested for both mentioned \n\nwave conditions, namely 45 and 66 degrees. \n\n6.2 SIMULATIONS \n\nThe numerical simulations to study the 2DH behavior of the hydrodynamics around \n\nan MFAR have been done for eight cases, varying the reef angle (45\u00b0 and 66\u00b0) and the \n\nuse or not use of a platform, for the two mentioned wave conditions. Table 6.2 gives an \n\noverview of the values of the parameters in these simulations.  \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 - Tested values of the parameters. \n\nCase Reef angle (\u00b0) Form of the reef H (m) T (s) \n\n1 45 Triangle 4.0 15 \n\n2 45 Triangle 1.5 9 \n3 45 Triangle plus platform 4.0 15 \n\n4 45 Triangle plus platform 1.5 9 \n\n5 66 Triangle 4.0 15 \n\n6 66 Triangle 1.5 9 \n7 66 Triangle plus platform 4.0 15 \n\n8 66 Triangle plus platform 1.5 9 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 shows the reef parameters in the simulations for a reef without platform and \n\nfor a reef with platform. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n133 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - Geometry simulations (left: without platform, right: with platform). \n\n \n\nTable 6.3 gives the characteristics of the simulations for the different cases described \n\nin Table 6.2. Cases 1, 3, 5 and 7 have a larger grid than the cases 2, 4, 6 and 8 due to the \n\nlarger wave length. Due to this larger wave length both the plane bottom in the \n\nbeginning of the reef and the sponge layers are longer, since the sponge layer is 1.25 \n\ntimes the wave length at the wave maker.  \n \n\nTable 6.3 - Characteristics of the simulations. \n\n Cases 1,3,5,7 Cases 2,4,6,8 \n\nSimulation time (s) 600  600 \n\nCPU time needed (hours) 33  23 \n\nNumber of gridpoints per \n\nwavelength \n58 32 \n\nCourant number 0.10 0.10 \n\nGrid size (m) 2.99  2.99 \n\nTime step (s) 0.025  0.025 \n\nTotal number of gridpoints 196645 148740 \n\n \n\nBeach \n\n   45\u00b0/66\u00b0 \n\n> 2.0*L \n\nBeach \n\n275 m  \n\n75 m \n\nBottom slope 1:50 \n\nPlane bottom  \n\n> 2.0*L \n275 m \n\n75 m \n\nBottom slope 1:50 \n\nPlane bottom  \n\nInternal source Internal source \n\n   45\u00b0/66\u00b0 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n134 \n\n6.3 METHODOLOGY \n\n6.3.1 COASTAL PROTECTION \n\nFor the analysis concerning coastal protection, the velocities around the reef are \n\nanalyzed. The output velocities of the model correspond to values at a depth 0.531h \n\nunder the water surface. The velocity at this depth is, by several authors, as Nwogu \n\n(1993), taken as the depth representative of the flow and was adopted by the authors of \n\nthe COULWAVE model. However, the mean current is a better parameter as an \n\nindication for the sediment transport than the mean velocity. For this purpose, i.e., to \n\nobtain the mean current value, the numerical code of the model has to be changed. The \n\nvelocity has to be integrated in the vertical and subsequently divided by the depth at \n\neach point; this is a future task. In this work, even for the preliminary analysis of the \n\nflow that could give an indication of the sediment transport, the output velocity at a \n\ndepth 0.531h under the water surface is used. In each gridpoint the time series of the \n\nvelocities in both the x and y directions are averaged in time. The two vectors, of u in x \n\ndirection and v in y direction, are summed to get the velocity vector in each gridpoint, in \n\nthe x,y field. This velocity field gives an indication about the direction of the movement \n\nthat the sediment will have in the simulated cases.  \n\n6.3.2 SURFABILITY \n\nIn chapter 3 the theoretical study of surfability has been described. Three surfability \n\nparameters were investigated, namely the breaker height, the Iribarren number and the \n\npeel angle. In this chapter the same parameters will be analyzed. Furthermore the results \n\nof the 2DH simulations with COULWAVE give the possibility to study the position of \n\nthe breaker line and the wave height around the reef. Below the parameters that will be \n\nstudied are named:  \n\n\u2022 Position of the breaker line and wave heights around the reef, which shows the wave \n\nfocusing; \n\n\u2022 Peel angle; \n\n\u2022 Breaker height; \n\n\u2022 Iribarren number, which indicates the type of the breaking wave. \n \nThe steps for the computed analysis of the surfability parameters are as follows: \n \n\n1. A selection of a simulating area is made around the reef. And the model is run \n\nwith the incident wave characteristics presented in Table 6.2. The offshore \n\nboundary is at least two times the wave length at the wave maker and the side \n\nboundaries are at least one time the wave length (Figure 6.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n135 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 6.2 - Simulation area. \n\n \n\n2. In order to spare calculation time a small area where the reef is situated, is selected \n\nfor the analysis. This area is represented as the striped rectangle in Figure 6.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.3 - Selected area around the reef. \n\n \n\nBased on model results, for the selected area shown in Figure 6.3 and for each grid \n\npoint, the maximum wave height, Hmax, is calculated based on the time series of the \n\nsurface elevation that is an output of the model and presented in a figure where the \n\nwave focusing and defocusing can be analyzed. The wave height has to be calculated \n\nbecause the model doesn\u2019t give the wave height as an output.  \n\n \n\n3. To find the point of breaking at the edges of the reef the criteria adopted is that the \n\nbreaker height divided by breaker depth is 0.8, according to Sverdrup and Munk, \n\n1946. For the tests to achieve preliminary guidelines (see chapter 3) a value of 1.1 \n\nwas used, according to the results presented in Kaminsky and Kraus, 1993. However, \n\nas the breaker height and the slope that the wave experiences on the reef vary along \n\nthe breaker line, it is chosen to use in this 2DH analysis the original value of the \n\nbreaker parameter of 0.8.  \n\n \n\n4.

The peel angle (?) is calculated as the angle ? minus ? (see Figure \n6.5).

These cases will need \n\nlarge attention in the morphological study to see if this indication is correct, \n\nbecause if erosion will really take place in storm conditions these are not good \n\ngeometries to choose;  \n\n\u2022 For all other cases (cases 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8) no clear indication is found for erosion \n\nor sedimentation at the shoreline. A morphological study will be needed to get \n\nmore information about the mode of sedimentation occur or not near by the \n\nshoreline behind the reef.  \n\n6.4.2 SURFABILITY \n\nAs mentioned in section 6.2.2 five parameters will be analyzed here to get insight in \n\nthe surfability capacities obtained with the several geometries of the reef shown in \n\nTable 6.2. Below these parameters, namely (I) the breaker line and wave focusing, (II) \n\nthe breaker height, (III) the peel angle and (IV) the Iribarren number, will be treated in \n\nsequence.  \n\n \n\nI. Breaker line and wave focusing \n\nFor all cases studied, the breaker line on the reef is shown in Figure 6.10 to Figure \n\n6.14. In order to show the effect of wave focusing on the breaker line for cases 2, 4, 6 \n\nand 8 the wave heights around the reef are also presented in Figure 6.10 to Figure 6.14. \n\nThese figures show clearly that the more presence of wave focusing, the earlier the \n\nwave breaks on the reef. For cases 1, 3, 5 and 7 there is almost no wave focusing on the \n\nreef. This is due to the fact that the high waves have already broken before the reef. The \n\nfigures with the wave heights around the reef for cases 1, 3, 5 and 7 can be found in \n\nFigure II.1 to Figure II.4, in Annex II. \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n142 \n\nCommon condition, H = 1.5 m, T = 9 s: \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n\n \n\n                             \n \n\nFigure 6.10 - Breaker line for case 2, wave heights for case 2 and breaker line for case 4. \n\n \n\nHmax(m) \n\nWave focusing \n\n= breaker line \n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nX (m))\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nEarlier breaking due to wave \nfocusing \n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nEarlier breaking due to wave \nfocusing \n\n= breaker line \nCase 2 \n\nCase 2 \n\nCase 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n143 \n\n          \n \n \n\n      \n\n    \n \n\nFigure 6.11 \u2013 Wave heights for case 4, and wave heights and breaker line for case 6. \n\n \n \n\nHmax (m) \n\nWave  focusing \n\n450 500 550\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n450 500 550\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nm \n\nWave focusing \n\n= breaker line \n\nEarlier breaking due to wave \nfocusing \n\nCase 6 \n\nCase 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n144 \n\n   \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Breaker line and wave heights for case 8. \n\n \n\nStorm condition, H = 4.0 m, T =15 s: \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 Breaker line for case 1. \n\nHmax (m) \n\nWave focusing along the \nwhole breaker line \n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\n= breaker line \n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\n= breaker line \nCase 1 \n\nCase 8 \n\nCase 8 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 6.14 - Breaker line for cases 1, 3, 5 and 7. \n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\n= breaker line \n\n= breaker line \n\n450 500 550\n\n1050\n\n1100\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n450 500 550\n\n1050\n\n1100\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1100\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\nX (m)\n\nY\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n400 450 500 550 600\n\n1100\n\n1150\n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\n= breaker line \n\nCase 3 \n\nCase 5 Case 7 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n146 \n\n \n\nRegarding to the breaker line contours, the longer the breaker line the better for \n\nsurfers. From Figure 6.10 to Figure 6.14 it can be concluded that in all tested cases a \n\nbreaker line will be created on the reef. About the variation in the wave angle with and \n\nwithout platform for both wave conditions, it can be concluded that the breaker line is \n\nlonger for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 than for the angle of 66\u00b0. This makes the reef with a reef \n\nangle of 45\u00b0 more interesting for surfers than the reef with a reef angle of 66\u00b0.  \n \n\nII. Breaker wave height \n\nFor all eight cases analyzed here, the wave breaker height along the breaker line is \n\ngiven in Figure 6.15 to Figure 6.18. The figures were separated in cases with storm \n\ncondition (cases 1, 3, 5 and 7) and cases with common condition (cases 2, 4, 6 and 8). \n\nDue to this reason the graphs of cases 1 and 3, cases 5 and 7, cases 2 and 4 and cases 6 \n\nand 8 are combined in separate figures.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.15 - Breaker wave height for cases 1 and 3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n400 420 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 580 600\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nX (m)\n\nH\nb\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nCase 1 \n\nCase 3 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n147 \n\n \nFigure 6.16 - Breaker wave height for cases 5 and 7. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.17 - Breaker wave height for cases 2 and 4. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nX (m)\n\nH\nb\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nCase 5 \n\nCase 7 \n\n420 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 580\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nX (m)\n\nH\nb\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nCase 2 \n\nCase 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n148 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.18 - Breaker wave height for cases 6 and 8. \n\n \n\nRegarding Figure 6.15 to Figure 6.18, below is described, for all cases, what is the \n\ndevelopment of the breaker wave height along the breaker line from the apex of the \n\nstructure and in the direction of the shoreline. The beginning of the breaker line is at the \n\napex of the delta, at x = 500 m.  \n\n \n\nFor the storm condition, H = 4.0 m and T = 15 s: \n\nCase 1: Hb gets a bit larger in the beginning (during the first 50 m each side) and gets \n\nsmaller at the end; varying from 3.0 to 2.5 m; \n\nCase 3: Hb is quite constant in the beginning (during the first 50 m each side) and gets \n\nsmaller at the end, the maximum is 2.6 m; varying from 2.6 to 2.2 m; \n\nCase 5: Hb gets a bit larger and constant during the first 30 m and much smaller at the \n\nend; varying from 3.0 to 2.3 m; \n\nCase 7: Hb gets higher in the beginning and decreases constantly along the breaker line; \n\nvarying from 2.3 to 2.0 m. \n\n \n\nFor the common condition, H = 1.5 m T = 9 s: \n\nCase 2: Hb gets higher in the beginning and decreases constantly along the breaker line; \n\nvarying from 2.7 to 1.7 m; \n\nCase 4: Hb gets higher in the beginning and stays approximately constant at the end \n\n(after 40 m each side); varying from 2.4 to 1.9 m; \n\n460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nX (m)\n\nH\nb\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nCase 8 \n\nCase 6 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n149 \n\nCase 6: Hb gets higher in the beginning, decreases suddenly reaching the minimum at \n\nabout 15 m each side, then grows and gets smaller again; varying from 2.8 to 1.5 m; \n\nCase 8: Hb is gets a bit smaller in the beginning and gets a bit larger in the end; varying \n\nfrom 2.5 to 2.3 m. \n\n \n\nConcerning the wave height at the breaker point, the preferred wave height depends \n\non the skill of the surfer. The higher the skill of the surfer, the higher wave is preferred. \n\nHowever, it is easier to start surfing for every surfer when the wave is somewhat higher, \n\nat the beginning, especially when the peel angle is small. From Figure 6.15 to Figure \n\n6.18 and from what is described above the following can be concluded: \n\n \n\nFor the storm condition, H = 4.0 m and T = 15 s: \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle variation without platform (cases 1 and 5), its \n\ndevelopment along the breaker line case 5, with a reef angle of 66\u00b0, is better than \n\ncase 1, with a reef angle of 45\u00b0, because the wave height are higher at the apex in \n\nthat case; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle variation with platform (cases 3 and 7), its development \n\nalong the breaker line case 3, with a reef angle of 45\u00b0, is more interesting for more \n\nprofessional surfers, because the wave height is larger; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 1 and 3), \n\nit can be concluded that case 1, without platform, is more interesting for more \n\nprofessional surfers; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 5 and 7), \n\nit can be concluded that case 5, without platform, is more interesting for more \n\nprofessional surfers.  \n\n \n\nCase 7 is the best case for the storm condition tested, as the wave height is best for \n\namateur surfers along the ride and the wave height is larger at the apex, which makes \n\nstarting easier.  \n\n \n\nFor the common condition, H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s: \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle without platform (cases 2 and 6), its development along \n\nthe breaker line case 6, with a reef angle of 66\u00b0, is better, because the wave height \n\nis smaller along the ride; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle with platform for the common condition (cases 4 and 8), \n\nneither case 4, with a reef angle of 45\u00b0, nor case 8, with a reef angle of 66\u00b0, show \n\na significant advantage; \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n150 \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 2 and 4), \n\ncase 2, without platform, is more interesting for more professional surfers, \n\nalthough there is not much difference; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 6 and 8), \n\ncase 8, with platform, is more interesting for better surfers, because the wave \n\nheight has a constant higher value. \n\n \n\nCase 6 is the best for the surf condition tested, because the wave height is best for \n\namateur surfers along the ride and larger at the apex.  \n\n \n\nIII. Peel angle \n\nFor all cases analyzed in this chapter, the peel angle along the breaker line is given in \n\nFigure 6.19 to Figure 6.22. For all cases the peel angle at the apex, at x = 500 m, is the \n\nsmallest one.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.19 - Peel angle for cases 1 and 3. \n\n400 420 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 580 600\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nX (m)\n\np\ne\ne\nl \na\nn\ng\nle\n\n (\n? )\n\nCase 1 \n\nCase 3 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n151 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.20 - Peel angle for cases 5 and 7. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.21 - Peel angle for cases 2 and 4. \n\n450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nX (m)\n\np\ne\ne\nl \na\nn\ng\nle\n\n (\n? )\n\nCase 5 \n\nCase 7 \n\n420 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 580\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nX (m)\n\np\ne\ne\nl \na\nn\ng\nle\n\n (\n? )\n\nCase 2 \n\nCase 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n152 \n\n \nFigure 6.22 - Peel angle for cases 6 and 8. \n\n \n\nRegarding Figure 6.19 to Figure 6.22, below is described, for all cases, what is the \n\ndevelopment of the peel angle along the breaker line from the apex of the structure and \n\nin the direction of the shoreline.  \n\n \n\nFor the storm condition, H = 4.0 m and T = 15 s: \n\nCase 1: The peel angle is quite constant over most part of the breaker line (during about \n\n40 m each side), varying between 33\u00b0 and 39\u00b0. At the apex there is a low value of 7\u00b0 \n\ndue to the rounding of the breaker line; at the ends there is a high value of more than \n\n60\u00b0 due to the larger angle of the breaker line.  \n\nCase 3: The development of the peel angle is almost the same as in case 1, just in this \n\ncase the constant part varies between 33\u00b0 and 38\u00b0, the low value at the apex is 10\u00b0. \n\nCase 5: The peel angle grows from 40\u00b0 near by the apex till 55\u00b0 at the end. At the apex \n\nthere is a minimum value of 5\u00b0.   \n\nCase 7: The peel angle varies from 30\u00b0 to 38\u00b0. At the apex there is a minimum value of \n\n21\u00b0.   \n\n \n\nFor the common condition, H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s: \n\nCase 2: The peel angle has a minimum value of 10\u00b0 at the apex and goes up and down \n\ntowards the end, varying from 38\u00b0 near by the apex to 28\u00b0 in the middle and 42\u00b0 near by \n\nthe end. At the end the value decreases to 12\u00b0 and increases again to 50\u00b0. \n\n460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nX (m)\n\np\ne\ne\nl \na\nn\ng\nle\n\n (\n? ) Case 6 \n\nCase 8 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n153 \n\nCase 4: The peel angle has a minimum value of 15\u00b0 at the apex and goes down from the \n\napex toward the end, varying from 42\u00b0 near by the apex to 15\u00ba-20\u00b0 near by the end. At \n\nthe end the value increases again to 50\u00b0.  \n\nCase 6: The peel angle has a minimum value of 23\u00b0 at the apex. The value varies from \n\n50\u00b0 near by the apex to 33\u00b0 in the middle and 67\u00b0 at the end. \n\nCase 8: The peel angle has an equal development as in case 6, just in this case the \n\nminimum value is 10\u00b0 and the values vary from 33\u00b0 near by the apex to 18\u00b0 in the \n\nmiddle and 33\u00b0 at the end.  \n\n \n\nRegarding the peel angle, the preferred peel angle is not straightforward. A small \n\nvariation in the peel angle along the ride does not represent a problem since surfers \n\nactually like some variation. However, the peel angle should be between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 for \n\namateur surfers, as mentioned before. More professional surfers can also surf peel \n\nangles between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0. From Figure 6.19 to Figure 6.22 and also from what is \n\ndescribed above the following can be concluded: \n\n \n\nFor the storm condition, H = 4.0 m and T = 15 s: \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle without platform (cases 1 and 5), both cases can be \n\nsurfed, however case 5 with a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is better for amateur surfers; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle with platform (cases 3 and 7), both cases can be surfed. \n\nThe difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 1 and 3), \n\nboth cases can be surfed. The difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 5 and 7), \n\nboth cases can be surfed, however case 5 without platform is better for amateur \n\nsurfers. \n\n  \n\nFor the common condition, H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s: \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle without platform (cases 2 and 6), case 6 with a reef \n\nangle of 66\u00b0 is surfable for amateur surfers. Case 2 with a reef angle of 45\u00b0 can \n\nonly be surfed by more professional surfers; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle with platform for the common condition (cases 4 and 8), \n\nboth cases are not able to be surfed by amateurs. Case 4 with a reef angle of 66\u00b0 \n\ncould be surfed in the beginning by professional surfers, but gets difficult to surf \n\ntowards the end;  \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 2 and 4), \n\nboth cases can only be surfed by more professional surfers. However, surfing gets \n\ndifficult towards the end of the breaker line in case 4 with platform; \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n154 \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 6 and 8), \n\ncase 6 without platform is surfable for both amateur and professional surfers. Case \n\n8 with platform is not surfable.  \n\n \n\nIV.

Then the value decreases till 0.78 and increases \n\nagain towards the end till a value of 0.90. \n\nCase 6 \n\nCase 8 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n157 \n\nCase 8: The Iribarren number is almost constant along the breaker line with a value of \n\n0.74. \n\n \n\nRegarding to the Iribarren number, plunging wave with an inshore Iribarren number \n\nvarying between 0.6 and 0.9 is the best to surf for both amateur and professional surfers \n\n(Henriquez, 2004). In order to catch the wave in the beginning it is preferred a smaller \n\nwave value of about 0.6 at the beginning of the ride. From Figure 6.23 to Figure 6.26 \n\nand taking into account what is described above the following can be concluded: \n\n \n\nFor the storm condition, H = 4.0 m and T = 15 s: \n\nAll cases are good to surf for amateur surfers, and.  \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle without platform (cases 1 and 5), both cases can be \n\nsurfed. The difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle with platform (cases 3 and 7), both cases can be surfed. \n\nThe difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 1 and 3), \n\nboth cases can be surfed. However, case 1 without platform has smaller values of \n\nthe Iribarren number along the breaker line, which makes catching the wave in the \n\nbeginning easier for amateur surfers; \n\n\u2022  For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 5 and 7), \n\nboth cases can be surfed, however case 5 without platform has smaller values of \n\nthe Iribarren number along the breaker line, which makes catching the wave in the \n\nbeginning easier for amateur surfers. \n\n  \n\nFor the common condition, H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s: \n\n\u2022 Concerning the reef angle without platform (cases 2 and 6), both cases can be \n\nsurfed, however case 2 with a reef angle of 66\u00b0 has smaller values of the Iribarren \n\nnumber along the breaker line, which makes catching the wave in the beginning \n\neasier for amateur surfers; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the reef angle with platform (cases 4 and 8), both cases can be surfed. \n\nThe difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 45\u00b0 (cases 2 and 4), \n\nboth cases can be surfed. The difference is minimal; \n\n\u2022 For the option of yes or no for a platform for the reef angle of 66\u00b0 (cases 6 and 8), \n\nboth cases can be surfed, however case 8 with platform has smaller values of the \n\nIribarren number along the breaker line, which makes catching the wave in the \n\nbeginning easier for amateur surfers.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n158 \n\n6.5 CONCLUSION \n\nUsing the calibrated numerical model COULWAVE, eight cases have been \n\nsimulated to get insights about the hydrodynamic behavior around a reef in order to find \n\nthe capability of the reef to protect the local coastline of Leirosa, Portugal, and to \n\nincrease the local surfing possibilities.  \n\nBased on the cases studied it was not possible to define an optimal geometry of an \n\nMFAR in terms of coastal protection based only on the indication given by the velocity \n\nfields for the eight cases studied. However, the indication for the storm wave conditions \n\n(H = 4.0 m and T =15 s) tested, is in most cases erosion near by the shoreline. The \n\nindication for common wave conditions (H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s), is unclear for all cases; \n\nneither erosion nor sedimentation is a clear indication. A morphodynamic study needs \n\nto be executed to get a deeper insight about designs of geometries that give \n\nsedimentation near by the shoreline in storm wave conditions. Besides that, a more \n\nprofound morphodynamic study needs to be conducted to investigate the mode of \n\nsedimentation, erosion or sedimentation, under common wave conditions. \n\nAnyway, in terms of coastal protection a reef with platform seem to constitute a good \n\nfirst option. \n\nThe optimal geometry of an MFAR in terms of surfability can be divided into four \n\nsurf parameters: \n\n\u2022 Regarding the breaker line, for both the storm condition and the common wave \n\ncondition, the cases of a reef angle of 45\u00b0 are better, because they give longer \n\nbreaker lines, by which the surfers can make a longer ride; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the breaker wave height, for both the storm and the common wave \n\ncondition, the case without platform and a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is the best option for \n\namateur surfers.  \n\n\u2022 Regarding the peel angle, for both the storm and the common wave condition, the \n\ncase without platform and a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is the best for amateur surfers. \n\n\u2022 Regarding the Iribarren number, for the storm condition, the case without \n\nplatform is the best for amateur surfers. The variation in the reef angle does not \n\nseem to make difference. For the common condition, the case without platform \n\nand a reef angle of 45\u00b0 is the best for amateur surfers. \n\n \n\nTaking all four surf parameters into account, the case without platform and with a \n\nreef angle of 66\u00b0 is the best choice for the geometry in terms of surfability. Although \n\ntwo of the four parameters give better results for a reef angle of 45\u00b0, the angle of 66\u00b0 is \n\nchosen to be better due to the larger importance of the peel angle and the breaker wave \n\nheight with respect to the Iribarren number and the length of the breaker line. Besides \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n159 \n\nthat, the Iribarren number is good for all tested cases and the variation in this parameter \n\nis very small. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 Optimal geometry of the Multi-Functional Artificial Reef \n\n160 \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nChapter 7 Conclusions and Recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 Conclusions and recommendations \n\n163 \n\n7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n7.1 CONCLUSIONS \n\nPortugal is one of many countries in the world that suffers from coastal erosion. \n\nConventional ways of protecting a coastline appear to entail some disadvantages. An \n\ninnovative and interesting way of protecting a local coastal zone is by means of multi-\n\nfunctional artificial reefs. A multi-functional artificial reef is a submerged breakwater \n\nwhich, besides the helping to protect the local coastline, can have other purposes; in \n\nparticular it may enhance the surfing possibilities and the environmental value of the \n\nlocal area. The structure has several positive side-effects: first, it provides an \n\nunimpaired visual amenity; second, it offers tourist and economic benefits by improving \n\nthe surfing conditions; third, it can enhance the environmental value of the area where it \n\nis built, and fourth, with a proper design the down drift erosion can be minimal. \n\n \n\nAs a result of a theoretical study, a preliminary design, achieved step by step, is \n\nproposed for a multi-functional artificial reef making use of the theory and the state of \n\nthe art. The proposed reef geometry is used as initial design in the numerical and \n\nphysical tests, which are executed to analyze the hydrodynamics around a multi-\n\nfunctional reef breakwater in order to see the tendencies and obtain preliminary results \n\nrelated with the protection of a stretch of the central coast of Portugal and to increase \n\nthe local surfing possibilities. The main design parameters for an MFAR are the reef \n\nangle, the height of the reef, the form of the reef in plant, the submergence of the reef, \n\nthe horizontal dimensions and the seaward slope of the reef structure. Taking into \n\naccount the condition that the proposed geometry function properly on a sea slope \n\nbottom of less than 1:50, the main preliminary choices are as follows: the upper part of \n\nthe structure is a delta shaped with an angle of 66\u00ba and a side slope of 1:10, and the \n\nlower part consists of a platform whose slopes are as steep as possible. The position of \n\nthe reef should be such that the distance from the apex of the structure to the \n\nundisturbed shoreline is greater than 1.5 the natural surf zone width. \n\n \n\nTwo design parameters (the submergence of the reef and the length of the reef) have \n\ninfluence on the breaker type that should be determined. Therefore, a physical and a \n\nnumerical 2DV study have been executed to get insight in the influence of the length of \n\nthe reef and the submergence on the Iribarren number, which is an indication for the \n\nbreaker type for the reef functionality. From both studies, it was concluded that for the \n\ncommon wave conditions tested, the design wave height of 1.50 m gives a good \n\nsurfable plunging wave for a submergence of 1.50 m. From the numerical tests, initial \n\nvalues of several parameters for the simulations carried out in order to find the optimal \n\n\n\nChapter 7 Conclusions and recommendations \n\n164 \n\ngeometry were determined: the height of the reef is 3.20 m, the seaward slope of the \n\nreef is 1:10 and the reef submergence is equal to the design wave height of 1.50 m.   \n\n \n\nIn order to be able to investigate the other three design parameters (the reef angle, the \n\ngeometry of the reef (with or without a platform) and the horizontal dimensions in \n\n2DH) for the optimal geometry, the Boussinesq-type COULWAVE model is firstly \n\ncalibrated. The influences of the bottom friction and of the upwind fraction differences \n\nwere investigated on the significant wave height and the energy spectrum. The \n\ninfluences of the breaking parameters on the significant wave height were also studied. \n\nIt can be concluded that the default values of all investigated parameters give very \n\nsimilar results to the laboratory data of a submerged reef in a wave basin (obtained by \n\nPoort, 2007). Because of that, it was chosen to set all investigated parameters on the \n\ndefault values for the simulations that were carried out to investigate the design \n\nparameters of the MFAR. \n\n \n\nAn optimal geometry of an MFAR for the local coastline of Leirosa, Portugal, in \n\nterms of coastal protection was not possible to define with the indication given by the \n\nvelocity fields of the eight cases simulated. The indication for storm wave conditions (H \n\n= 4 m and T = 15 s) is in most cases erosion near by the shoreline. The indication for the \n\ncommon wave condition (H = 1.5 m and T = 9 s) is unclear for all cases; neither erosion \n\nnor sedimentation is clearly indicated. A morphodynamic study is needed to get a \n\ndeeper insight of the reef geometry on the morphodynamic response.  \n\n \n\nThe optimal geometry of an MFAR in terms of surfability can be divided into four \n\nsurf parameters; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the breaker line, for both wave conditions tested, a reef angle of 45\u00b0 \n\ngives a longer breaker line, by which the surfers can make a longer ride; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the breaker wave height, for both wave conditions tested, the case \n\nwithout platform and a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is the best for amateur surfers; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the peel angle, for both wave conditions tested, the case without \n\nplatform and a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is the best for amateur surfers; \n\n\u2022 Regarding the Iribarren number, for the storm condition, the case without \n\nplatform is the best one for amateur surfers. The variation in the reef angle does \n\nnot make much difference. For the common condition, the case without platform \n\nand a reef angle of 45\u00b0 is the best one for amateur surfers. \n\n \n\nTaking all four surf parameters into account, the case without platform and a reef \n\nangle of 66\u00b0 is the best choice for the geometry in terms of surfability. Although two of \n\n\n\nChapter 7 Conclusions and recommendations \n\n165 \n\nthe four parameters give better results for a reef angle of 45\u00b0, the angle of 66\u00b0 is chosen \n\nto be better due to the larger importance of the peel angle and the breaker wave height \n\nwith respect to the Iribarren number, and the length of the breaker line. Besides that, the \n\nIribarren number is good for all tested cases and the variation in this parameter is very \n\nsmall. \n\n \n\nComparing the results of the 2DH study with COULWAVE model for the optimal \n\ngeometry and the results of the theoretical study, it can be concluded that, regarding the \n\nsurfability parameters, a reef angle of 66\u00b0 is a better choice than the reef angle of 45\u00b0. \n\nMoreover, in contradiction to the expected results with a platform in the theoretical \n\nstudy, a reef without platform appeared to be better option in the 2DH study. This is a \n\nconsequence of the wave focusing that couldn\u2019t be taken into account in the theoretical \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\n7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nSome research questions were faced during this investigation, which lead to some \n\nrecommendations for future work: \n\n1. The investigation of the wave shape, in the laboratory study, was carried out on a \n\nsubmerged reef with a smooth slope and a rigid material bottom. However, it is \n\nrecommended to investigate the wave shape also over porous bottoms, like \n\ngeotextile sand containers as this is the material which is the most suitable to build \n\nan MFAR. Within these containers, the turbulence and the energy dissipation will \n\nbe different than over a rigid bottom, which is expected to have an influence on \n\nthe wave shape. \n\n2. The calibration of the numerical COULWAVE model has shown that it can be \n\nsuccessfully used to simulate the hydrodynamics around an MFAR. However, \n\nimprovements are recommended on the actual version of COULWAVE. This \n\nimprovement includes mainly the introduction of porous flow simulation. This \n\nwill enables the model to study global coastal areas with submerged porous \n\nstructures.  \n\n3. Even though the velocity patterns give an indication about the sediment transport, \n\nthey are not sufficient to get a deep insight about the influence of an MFAR on the \n\nmorphology around the reef. For a proper design of a reef to protect a local \n\ncoastline a morphological study has to be executed in which longshore currents, \n\ncorrect bathymetry, tide and wave angles have to be taken into account. \n\n4. Even though COULWAVE has appeared to be a numerical model suitable to \n\nstudy the hydrodynamics around an MFAR, it would be even better to use a \n\nnumerical model in the future that can simulate the wave shape on the reef. In \n\n\n\nChapter 7 Conclusions and recommendations \n\n166 \n\nchapter 4 the use of COBRAS-UC is described. COBRAS-UC is not yet available \n\nfor 3D studies, but as soon as possible, it is recommended to use a similar model \n\nfor hydrodynamic studies around an MFAR. \n\n5. In chapter 6, the bathymetry and the wave conditions used are those found in \n\ngeneral along the central western coast of Portugal. However, it is recommended \n\nto make any case-study taking into account the exact bathymetry and the wave \n\nconditions in the area. \n\n6. It is recommended to include an economical study for the construction of an \n\nMFAR in the case-study. That should involve, for example, the costs of material \n\nand the construction costs using different techniques. \n\n7. As described in this thesis, an MFAR has two main goals. One is protecting the \n\nlocal coastline and the other is increasing the local surfing possibilities. It is \n\nrecommended to investigate the need for and interest in increasing the local \n\nsurfing possibilities in front of the coast where the reef is designed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBibliography \n\n167 \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n\nAgnon, Y., Madsen, P.
