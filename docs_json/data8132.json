Os \npar\u00e2metros geoqu\u00edmicos foram tamb\u00e9m estudados na coluna de sedimentos \ndepositada nos \u00faltimos 150 anos e em sedimentos pr\u00e9-industriais. Os referidos \npar\u00e2metros determinados foram: concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elementares, is\u00f3topos \nest\u00e1veis de Pb, teores em materiais litog\u00e9nicos, carbonato de c\u00e1lcio e carbono \norg\u00e2nico. Os canh\u00f5es de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal e Cascais tiveram especial destaque \nno presente estudo dado que, at\u00e9 \u00e0 data, encontram-se menos estudados que \no Canh\u00e3o da Nazar\u00e9. Os resultados mostram que a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos \nna zona central da margem ocidental Portuguesa \u00e9 particionada pelos canh\u00f5es \ne que a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos da plataforma para zonas mais profundas \nda margem \u00e9 restringida pelas correntes do talude, excepto onde os canh\u00f5es \nfuncionam como corredores para o transporte de sedimentos. Enquanto no \nCanh\u00e3o de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal, e provavelmente no Canh\u00e3o de Cascais, o \ntransporte de sedimentos at\u00e9 \u00e0 zona inferior \u00e9 limitada, provavelmente apenas \ndespoletado por eventos de elevada energia, no Canh\u00e3o da Nazar\u00e9 o \ntransporte ao longo do todo o canh\u00e3o parece eficiente. As zonas superiores \ndos canh\u00f5es de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal e Cascais presentemente actuam como \narmadilhas de sedimentos finos, aprisionando part\u00edculas em suspens\u00e3o \nprovenientes da plataforma adjacente. A introdu\u00e7\u00e3o directa de sedimentos \nprovenientes das plumas dos rios Tejo e Sado nas zonas superiores dos \ncanh\u00f5es parece limitada, contudo a resuspens\u00e3o dos sedimentos do prodelta \ndo Tejo como resultado de ondas de tempestade e ondas de mar\u00e9 interna \npermite o transporte de sedimentos para os canh\u00f5es adjacentes. Na \nplataforma de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal-Sines foram identificadas as assinaturas \ngeoqu\u00edmicas e mineral\u00f3gicas de diferentes fontes de sedimentos finos (e.g. \nestu\u00e1rios do Tejo e Sado, arribas costeiras, lagoas de St. Andr\u00e9 e Melides). As \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es elementares pr\u00e9-industriais s\u00e3o muito semelhantes nos \ncanh\u00f5es da Nazar\u00e9 e Lisboa-Set\u00fabal, mas variados graus de enriquecimento \nantr\u00f3pico de metais tra\u00e7o est\u00e3o presentes nos sedimentos recentes. A mais \nacentuada influ\u00eancia antr\u00f3pica na \u00faltima \u00e1rea referida \u00e9 consistente com a sua \nproximidade a \u00e1reas densamente povoadas e industrializadas e com input de \nsedimentos origin\u00e1rios dos rios Tejo e Sado, potenciais transportadores de \npart\u00edculas poluentes. A dispers\u00e3o de Pb atmosf\u00e9rico parece tamb\u00e9m \nsignificativa sendo que toda a zona da plataforma continental adjacente aos \ncanh\u00f5es de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal e Cascais apresenta-se enriquecida. A principal \nfonte de Pb antr\u00f3pico identificada atrav\u00e9s de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis de Pb \u00e9 \nconsistente com a assinatura das cinzas de incineradoras. No Canh\u00e3o de \nLisboa a imers\u00e3o de dragados contaminados parece ser tamb\u00e9m uma \npotencial importante fonte de metais tra\u00e7o antropog\u00e9nicos.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nContinental shelf, Set\u00fabal, Lisbon, Nazar\u00e9, Cascais submarine canyons, \npathways of sediment transport, clay minerals, trace metals, stable lead \nisotopes. \n \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nIn order to study the main pathways of recent fine sediment transport in the \ncentral area of the west Portuguese continental margin between the Nazar\u00e9 \nCanyon and Cape Sines, geochemical, mineralogical and grain size \nparameters were analysed in surface sediments and sediment trap particulate \nmaterial. This data was integrated with observations on near-bottom \nhydrodynamics and sediment dispersal. The sediment column deposited over \nthe last 150 yrs and pre-industrial sediments were studied for the geochemical \nparameters. The determined geochemical parameters include elemental \nconcentrations, stable Pb isotopes, contents of lithogenic material, calcium \ncarbonate and organic carbon. The Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons \nreceived special attention in this study as these structures have had much less \nattention than the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The results show that sediment distribution \non the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by submarine canyons and \nexport of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental margin is restricted by \nslope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-slope \ntransport. While in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, and probably in the Cascais \nCanyon, down-canyon transport of sediments to the lower canyon is limited, \nconceivably only triggered by high energy events, in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon down-\ncanyon sediment transport seems efficient. The upper reaches of the Lisbon-\nSet\u00fabal and Cascais canyons presently act as traps for fine-grained sediments \nentrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf. Direct sediment input from the \nTagus and Sado river plumes into the upper canyons seems limited. However, \nresuspension of sediments from the Tagus prodelta as a result of storm waves \nand internal tidal waves seems enough for an efficient transport of sediments \ninto the upper Lisbon and Cascais canyons. In the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines \ncontinental shelf geochemical and mineralogical signatures from various fine \nsediment sources were identified (e.g. Tagus and Sado estuaries, sea-cliffs, St. \nAndr\u00e9 and Melides lagoons). The contribution of trace metals from \nanthropogenic sources was assessed by comparing present-day and average \nelemental concentrations for the industrial period with pre-industrial baseline \nvalues. Baseline elemental concentrations are very similar for the Nazar\u00e9 and \nLisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, but varying degrees of anthropogenic trace metal \nenrichments are recorded in more recent sediments. Enhanced anthropogenic \ninfluence in the latter area is consistent with its proximity to heavily populated \nand industrialized areas and with sediment input originated from the Tagus and \nSado rivers, potential major carriers of pollutant particles (Pb, Zn and Cu). \nAtmospheric dispersal of Pb seems important as well in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-\nSines margin and virtually all the studied continental shelf adjacent to the \nLisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons shows enrichment of Pb. The main \nsource of anthropogenic Pb identified through Pb stable isotope signatures \nseems to be incinerator fly ashes. Discharge of dredged contaminated \nsediments in the Lisbon Canyon appears also as a potentially important source \nof anthropogenic trace metals. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n i\n\nIndex \n\n \n\nThe Jury \n\nAgradecimentos / Acknowledgements \n\nResumo \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nIndex\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. i \n\nList of figures\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ix \n\nList of tables\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. xvii \n\n  \n\nStructure of the thesis\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1 \n\n  \n\nPart I: Introduction, Regional Setting, Materials and \n\nMethods 3 \n\n  \n\nChapter 1.

The objectives of the present \n\nthesis are also presented. \n\nChapter 2 is intended to be a characterisation of the submarine canyons from the \n\nwestern Portuguese margin. The surrounding areas of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais \n\ncanyons (adjacent continental margin, beaches, and river basins) are also described in \n\nterms of geomorphology, geology, oceanography and climate. \n\nIn Chapter 3 the materials (core, trap and grab sediment samples) and methods \n\n(geochemistry, mineralogy and grain size of sediments; mass deposition fluxes, sediment \n\naccumulation rates and near-bed hydrodynamic data) used for the present study are \n\npresented. \n\n \n\nPart II (Continental shelf and upper slope) \u2013 Results about the continental shelf are \n\npresented and discussed in two chapters. \n\nChapter 4 is focused on mineralogical parameters determined in surface sediments \n\nfrom the shelf/upper slope and its discussion deals mainly with using these parameters to \n\nidentify the main sources of fine-grained sediments and to gain insight in prevailing \n\ndispersal processes acting on the shelf. \n\nChapter 5 presents elemental contents of surface sediments from the shelf/upper \n\nslope and its discussion is focused on trace metal dispersal in surface sediment and its \n\nrelationships with pathways of recent sediment transport in the shelf. \n\n \n\nPart III (Submarine canyons and open slope) \u2013 Results about submarine canyons and \n\nopen slopes of the central Portuguese margin are presented and discussed in two \n\nchapters. \n\nIn Chapter 6 near-bottom hydrodynamic data and sedimentological data (general \n\ncomposition, grain size, Corg/N ratios and mineralogy) from surface and sediment trap \n\n\n\n 2 \n\nmaterial collected throughout the canyon are integrated in order to understand the recent \n\nsedimentary dynamics of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon system. Data from the Nazar\u00e9 and \n\nCascais canyons and from the open slope areas of Mondego, Estremadura and Sines are \n\nalso presented in order to obtain an overview about the pathways of recent fine-grained \n\nsediment transport on the central Portuguese margin, with especial focus on the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon.   \n\nChapter 7 presents geochemical data from surface and sediment trap material so as \n\nto determine anthropogenic inputs of trace metals. The knowledge of specific signatures \n\nand its dispersion will give insight into sedimentary processes operating on the central \n\nPortuguese margin, again with especial focus on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon.  \n\n \n\nPart IV (Data integration and conclusions) \u2013 In this part, composed of one chapter, \n\ndata from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines continental shelf and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais \n\nsubmarine canyons are integrated, the main conclusions from the thesis are summarised \n\nand proposals for future investigations are indicated. \n\nChapter 8 is intended to integrate data from the four last chapters so as to build a \n\nmodel for the main pathways of fine-grained sediments in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and \n\nadjacent shelf area. \n\n\n\n 3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPart I \nIntroduction, Regional \nsetting, Materials and \nmethods\n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 5\n\n1 .  I N T R O D U C T I O N  \n\n1.1. Continental margins: main sedimentary processes \n\nContinental margins form relatively narrow transition zones between continental land \n\nmasses and deep-ocean basins. They are the main regions of input and transfer of \n\nparticulate matter to the oceans and, as such, they represent important zones of \n\nparticulate matter flux. \n\nThe continental margin is made up of the shallow, relatively flat continental shelf, \n\nbordered by an inclined continental slope, at the base of which there is often a wedge \n\nshaped accumulation of sediments, the continental rise. The continental shelf, which \n\ndepending on the geological setting may span from few to hundred kilometres wide, can \n\nroughly be subdivided in three other areas: inner shelf (10 - 50 m WD), middle shelf (50 - \n\n100 m WD) and outer shelf (100 - 200 m WD). \n\n1.1.1. Continental shelves \n\nThe continental shelf is generally an area where material derived from the continent \n\nis initially deposited, although it commonly only represents a temporary resting place for \n\nsediments. On the shelf there are two main directions of transport of particulate matter: \n\nalong-shelf and across-shelf transport. The magnitude of along-shelf particulate transport \n\nis usually much greater than that of across-shelf transport. Across-shelf transport can be \n\nimportant near capes and canyons, diverting flows across the shelf more effectively than \n\nother physical mechanisms. \n\nParticulate transport in both the along-shelf and across-shelf dimension is driven \n\nalmost entirely by water motions. The surf zone (traditionally not included in the \n\ncontinental shelf) is the area where the highest volumes of sediment move alongshore. \n\nThe dominant mechanism envisaged in alongshore transport in the surf zone is movement \n\nof sediment by longshore-directed currents generated by oblique waves. Since most wave \n\nenergy dissipation takes place in the surf zone, this is a zone where both suspended load \n\nand bedload longshore transport takes place.  \n\nComparably lower but still considerable volumes of sediment move alongshore on the \n\nshelf immediately seaward of the surf zone. Sediment transport in the inner shelf and \n\nfurther offshore is primarily wind-driven (Savidge &amp; Bane Jr., 2001) and highly dependent \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 6 \n\non sediment availability, topography and geology. Additionally, tidal currents have been \n\nidentified as responsible for significant longshore transport of sediments. \n\nThe flow regimes of continental shelves vary appreciably as water depth changes \n\nfrom shore to shelfbreak. Not only do flow velocities change across the shelf, but so do \n\nthe relative importance of various types of flows. The mechanisms that contribute most to \n\nacross-shelf particulate transport are: 1) wind-driven upwelling and downwelling flows; 2) \n\ninternal waves; 3) wave-orbital flows; 4) infragravity oscillations; 5) buoyant plumes \n\n(positive and negative); and 6) surf zone (wave driven) processes. Most of the above \n\ndriving processes are bidirectional and therefore capable of reversing direction of \n\ntransport. A review on the processes affecting transport of particles across continental \n\nshelves can be consulted, for example, in Nittrouer &amp; Wright (1994).  \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Continental slope and rise \n\nOnce on the slope, material exported from the shelf is subject to further transport \n\nunder influence of a variety of across-slope, along-slope and hemipelagic processes \n\n(Figure 1.1). Continental margin systems are likely to include all three components, albeit \n\nin differing proportions in space and time. It is important not only to recognize the \n\ninteraction of these processes, but also to appreciate their variation in magnitude, and \n\ntheir frequency (Evans et al., 1998). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1. Schematic model of the continental margin depicting the main processes described in the text. \nThe arrows indicate the directions of sediment movement. \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 7\n\nOn short time scale, across-slope sediment transport is often dominated by \n\nbidirectional tidal currents, moving sediment both in upslope and downslope direction. \n\nInternal tides are an efficient driver of sediment transport, especially in the deep and \n\nnarrow upper reaches of canyons where tidal currents are focused. On longer time scales, \n\nhowever, across slope transport is predominantly in downslope direction, driven by \n\ngravitational forces that continuously or episodically move sediment downslope over the \n\nsea floor into deeper water. They range in scale from minor creep to major translational \n\nslides, and may take place on a range of timescales. Sediment creep is a semi-continuous \n\nprocess caused by load-induced stress, whereas discrete debris flows, slumps and slides \n\nmay occur episodically, in between long periods of relative quiescence. Mass wasting \n\nevents may last from minutes to hours. Turbidity currents are another type of frequent \n\ndownslope event and they are sediment-laden water moving down a slope through water. \n\nThe current moves because it has a higher density (and turbidity) than the fluid through \n\nwhich it flows. Turbidity currents may flow for hours (high-density flows) up to days (low-\n\ndensity). During any single downslope event these various processes may operate \n\ntogether or in temporal sequence, slumps often disintegrating into debris flows and then \n\ninto turbidity currents. Continental margins subject to frequent downslope activity are \n\ncommonly characterised by slope aprons and submarine fans (Stow, 1986). \n\nBottom-current activity greatly influences both sediment accumulation and erosion on \n\ncontinental slopes. The effects of along-slope currents (contour-following, deep, \n\ngeostrophic currents) are particularly marked on slopes and basin plains within and \n\nadjacent to continental margins, where a variable sea-floor bathymetry may locally \n\nintensify and focus current activity. Sediment drifts and associated bedforms are the \n\ncharacteristic depositional product of along-slope bottom currents, and commonly \n\naccumulate where there is a change in the gradient of the seabed, such as at the base of \n\ncontinental slopes. Where particularly strong, bottom currents may cause erosion of the \n\nseabed and the formation of channels, moats and furrows (Evans et al., 1998). \n\nHemipelagic sedimentation includes the settling of pelagic as well as land-derived \n\nmaterial. Although commonly represented as a vertical flux, the settling velocity of the \n\nvery fine-grained bulk of hemipelagic sediment is usually far less than the velocity of \n\nprevailing horizontal currents, and the resulting flux is therefore nearer to horizontal than \n\nto vertical. Hemipelagites, formed by hemipelagic sedimentation, are poorly sorted, \n\npredominantly fine-grained sediments, with variable composition according to the \n\ncontribution from pelagic and terrestrial sources. They are commonly devoid of primary \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 8 \n\nsedimentary structures other than lamination, although lamination is usually thoroughly \n\nreworked by bioturbation. Their study is important because hemipelagic sedimentation is \n\nthe primary \u201cbackground\u201d process on margins. \n\nThe various processes operating in the continental shelf and slope need to be \n\nintegrated to produce a model of margin development. The characteristics, sources and \n\nfate of particulate matter in the sea are of great interest for other reasons than those \n\nrelated to sedimentology only. Two examples would be the dispersion of contaminants \n\n(Puig et al., 1999) and the nourishment of benthic ecosystems (Pfannkuche, 1993; Cartes \n\net al., 2002). A holistic approach is therefore needed in order to understand the complex \n\nenvironments found on the continental margins. \n\n \n\n1.2. Continental margins and submarine canyons: the state of art \n\nIn the past decades, several major multidisciplinary studies have been conducted all \n\nover the world to examine the processes and extent of exchange between the continental \n\nshelf, slope and deep sea. \n\nA holistic approach is necessary in these complex dynamic settings moulded by the \n\ninterplay of biology, physics, geochemistry and sedimentology. \n\nThe first great multidisciplinary effort was conducted in the Mid-Atlantic Bight on the \n\neastern US continental shelf and slope during the SEEP-I (1983-1984) and SEEP-II (1988-\n\n1989) projects (Biscaye et al., 1988, 1994). The overall SEEP working hypothesis was that \n\na large part of the organic particulate matter that is formed on or introduced to the shelf \n\nand not consumed there is not deposited and buried on the shelf but transported further \n\nseaward, to the adjacent slope and open ocean. The results of the project SEEP-II led to \n\nreject that hypothesis. The experiment revealed that only a small proportion (<&lt;5 %) of \n\nthis organic matter was exported to the adjacent slope (Biscaye et al., 1994), and much \n\nof the exported organic matter may have initially been deposited on the shelf or shelf \n\nbreak and resuspended and transported down-slope thousands of years later (Anderson \n\net al., 1994). Most of the biogenic particulate matter is recycled on the shelf and only the \n\nmost refractory (particulate) organic matter is likely to be exported (Bacon et al., 1994). \n\nDe Haas et al. (2002) reviewed several studies on continental shelves of the world \n\nand concluded that large areas of the world shelves do not show any accumulation of \n\norganic matter under present-day conditions. Only locally, where hydrological and \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 9\n\nsedimentological conditions are favourable for organic matter accumulation, considerable \n\namounts of organic carbon are buried, mainly where rivers introduce large amounts of \n\nfine-grained sediments and organic matter on the shelf, for example the Amazon River. \n\nFor most continental shelves, de Haas et al. (2002) depicted the following scenario: once \n\nthe fine-grained sediments associated with the organic carbon reach the shelf, a \n\ncontinuum of bioturbation and cycles of erosion, transport and redeposition takes place \n\nunder the influence of tidal and large scale shelf currents and storm induced waves and \n\ncurrents. After several cycles of successive exposition to oxic and anoxic conditions, most \n\nof the organic matter is mineralised; the sediments with the more refractory remainder of \n\nthe organic matter reach their final destination and become buried. \n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the SEEP experiments focused on the processes \n\ntaking place across the open slopes, largely avoiding submarine canyons. \n\nPartly concurrent with the SEEP effort, the interdisciplinary ECOMARGE project \n\n(1986-1988) (Monaco et al., 1990a) based in the Gulf of Lions did recognise the \n\nimportance of canyons in the shelf-slope exchange. It was noted that export of material \n\npreferentially occurred down the canyon systems, notably the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon \n\n(Monaco et al., 1990b). The project ECOFER (1989-1991) (based on the Cap Ferret \n\nCanyon) also showed preferential focusing of particulate matter in a submarine canyon \n\nincising the slope of the southeastern Bay of Biscay (Monaco et al., 1999a). \n\nSEEP-I &amp; II, ECOMARGE and subsequent multidisciplinary projects like KEEP (1989-\n\n1994), OMEX I (1993-1996) II (1997-2000), or FRUELA (1995-1996), concluded that \n\norganic particle flux to the slope is mainly supplied by lateral transport from the shelf and \n\nupper slope rather than by pelagic settling. Other authors reached the same conclusion \n\nfrom the deficit found between the vertical flux of organic matter and the energy and \n\nmaterial requirements of the benthos (e.g. Thomsen, 1999; Druffel &amp; Robinson, 1999). In \n\nother words, the concept of a \u201cbiological pump\u201d dominated by vertical processes, as \n\nconceived in open oceans, seems not applicable to ocean margin settings, where \n\nresuspension and lateral advection are major drivers of particle transport. \n\nAnother key finding of these projects was the importance of the along-shelf and \n\nalong-slope transport driven by the general circulation, as opposed to processes that \n\ntransport material offshore, which tend to be less common and focused in specific areas \n\n(Monaco et al., 1999b); this does not imply that offshore transport (e.g. upwelling \n\nprocesses) may not have major impact on particulate fluxes in specific areas of the globe. \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 10 \n\nWith regards to the carbon cycle, the relatively limited export of organic particulate \n\nmatter from the continental shelf to the slope and beyond found in the SEEP projects, has \n\nlater been confirmed in other margins of the world. After all, the SEEP results identified a \n\nmid-slope depocentre of organic carbon, whereas the OMEX-I project, found no obvious \n\ndepocentre of organic carbon in the northern Bay of Biscay margin (Wollast &amp; Chou, \n\n2001). However, Wollast &amp; Chou (2001) added to that conclusion that the possible role \n\nand importance of submarine canyons for the transportation of organic carbon to the \n\nslope had not been addressed in OMEX-I. This point was explored and confirmed in \n\nOMEX-II, namely in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Van Weering et al., 2002). High sedimentation \n\nrates (Schmidt et al., 2001) and high burial efficiencies of organic carbon (Epping et al., \n\n2002) and reactive phosphorus (Van der Zee et al., 2002) were encountered in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon sediments. The role of this canyon in the formation and offshore \n\nchannelling of thick nepheloid layers was also highlighted (McCave &amp; Hall, 2002).  \n\nA workshop on the role and functioning of canyons held in Sitges (Spain) in 2002 \n\nrevealed that only few of the canyons across the NW Mediterranean and NE Atlantic \n\nEuropean margin had been mapped and sampled in detail, and that transport processes \n\nand mass fluxes of particles, including organic matter, anthropogenic substances and \n\nurban waste to the deep sea and their sites of final deposition were virtually unknown \n\n(Van Weering &amp; Weaver, 2007). \n\nAs a consequence of the above, submarine canyons dissecting the European \n\ncontinental margins were one of the main targets of the EC-EUROSTRATAFORM (2002-\n\n2005) and HERMES projects (2005-2009). The EUROSTRATAFORM was the first EU-\n\nproject specifically looking at different submarine canyons from the European margins \n\nwith the objective of understanding their role in ocean margin strata formation. This \n\nproject aimed to understand sedimentary systems from source to sink. A key aim was to \n\ngain a better understanding of how sediment particles are transported from river mouths, \n\nacross the shallow shelf and/or through submarine canyons, down to the deep sea. By \n\nstudying different areas of the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean margins, it was possible to \n\ngain an idea on how these sedimentary systems work in different regional settings. \n\nIn April 2005 a new EU-project started with a different point of view. HERMES \n\n(Hotspots Ecosystems Research on the Margins of European Seas) was designed to gain \n\nnew insights into the biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics of marine \n\necosystems along Europe\u2019s deep-ocean margin. It represented the first major attempt to \n\ninvestigate and understand deep-water ecosystems and their environment in an \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 11\n\nintegrated way by bringing together expertise in biodiversity, geology, sedimentology, \n\nmicrobiology, physical oceanography and biogeochemistry. Submarine canyons were \n\nagain one of the main study areas in focus on this project. This time the goal was more \n\nambitions since it was not only about investigating the driving forces that control ocean \n\nmargin strata formation but also the ecosystems associated (Weaver et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Submarine canyons: conducts for across-margin transference of \n\nparticulate matter \n\nSubmarine canyons, incisions of up to hundreds of meters below the level of the \n\nsurrounding continental shelves and slopes, may constitute a significant alternative to the \n\nscenario depicted by De Haas et al. (2002). The focusing and channelling effect of \n\nsubmarine depressions may allow an important fraction of the labile organic matter to \n\nreach the open ocean, bypassing the slow pathway and subsequent intense \n\nremineralisation characteristic of non-dissected, gently sloping margins. This might \n\ntranslate into a greater percentage of labile organic matter to fuel deep sea food webs, \n\nand also in a larger amount of carbon sequestered from exchange with the atmosphere. \n\nThis rapid lateral transfer of organic matter is especially important in a semi-enclosed sea \n\nas the Mediterranean, where the high thermal stability of deep waters promotes rapid \n\ndegradation of organic matter. \n\nSubmarine canyons have often been regarded as relics of glacial periods of lowered \n\nsea-level, when voluminous quantities of sediment were carried by rivers right across \n\nwhat are now continental shelves (Pickering et al., 1989). Flooding of the continental \n\nshelves after the last glacial period decoupled continental drainage systems from \n\ndepocentres on the slope, and consequently the sedimentary regime on continental slopes \n\nhas shifted from a situation dominated by turbidity currents to another regime dominated \n\nby hemipelagic deposition (Nelson, 1976; Thorbjarnarson et al., 1986). Sediment supply \n\nto the continental slope and the role of submarine canyons as pathways of sediments to \n\nthe deep-sea floor, have both been drastically reduced. However, there is evidence that, \n\neven with the present high sea-level stand, many submarine canyons of the world\u2019s \n\ncontinental margins continue to channel and/or accumulate substantial quantities of \n\nsediment and therefore organic matter (e.g. Puig &amp; Palanques, 1998a; Lewis &amp; Barnes, \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 12 \n\n1999; Van Weering et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2002; Paull et al., 2003; De Stigter et al., \n\n2007b). \n\nOne of the main contributions from the EUROSTRATAFORM was that at the present \n\nclimatically controlled high sea-level stand, the majority of the finer grained material \n\ntransported into the canyons is retained largely in the upper and middle part of the \n\ncanyons (1500\u20133000 m water depth) and these parts of the canyons act as a temporary \n\nbuffer for the storage of sediment and carbon (Van Weering &amp; Weaver, 2007). \n\nModern sedimentation rates (e.g. Carpenter et al., 1982; Sanchez-Cabeza et al., \n\n1999; Schmidt et al., 2001, Van Weering et al., 2002; Turchetto et al., 2007) and \n\ndownward particulate matter fluxes (e.g. Puig &amp; Palanques, 1998a; Monaco et al., 1999b; \n\nHung et al., 2003; De Stigter et al., 2007b) have been found much higher in many \n\nsubmarine canyons than on the adjacent open slopes. \n\nMany canyons continue to be favourable sites for the concentration of fine-grained \n\nsediments, whereas some of them are able to tap on abundant terrigenous sediment \n\nsupplies, namely those that head off large rivers. In certain cases the canyon enters the \n\nriver mouth, forming a continuum with the river bed, as for example the Sepik Canyon \n\n(Walsh &amp; Nittrouer, 2003) or the Zaire Canyon (Khripounoff et al., 2003). \n\nHowever, proximity to a river is not a prerequisite for canyons to be active. On \n\nnarrow, tectonically active margins, canyons have cut headward across the continental \n\nshelf, intercepting the sediment transported by along-shore currents (Lewis &amp; Barnes, \n\n1999). For example, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (central Portuguese margin) is remote from any \n\nmajor stream, but as the canyon crosses the full length of the continental shelf and \n\nvirtually reaches the shore, substantial amounts of material transported by the along-shelf \n\ncurrents are trapped in the canyon. Exports of material from the shelf to the deeper \n\ncanyon is testified by thick nepheloid layers observed throughout the upper and middle \n\ncanyon (McCave et al. 2001), and strong downward fluxes of sandy sediments and \n\nterrestrial plants debris observed at 3200 m water depth near the bottom (Mart\u00edn et al., \n\n2004). In the canyon below 2700 m water depth most of the suspended sediments settle \n\nand are only transported to the lower canyon by sediment gravity flows occurring on a \n\nyearly or longer timescale (De Stigter et al., 2007b). \n\nAlso for the Cap Ferret Canyon on the southern Bay of Biscay margin, Mulder et al. \n\n(2001) proved that turbidity currents are occurring in present times, despite the absence \n\nof a direct connection with an important fluvial sediment source. \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 13\n\nThus, while some canyons act as passive depocentres for the particles entering them \n\nvia hemipelagic settling (Hickey et al., 1986; Carson et al., 1986), others are able to \n\nconvey the particulate matter further to deeper water, acting as preferential conduits for \n\nmatter transfer to deeper domains (Gardner, 1989; Puig &amp; Palanques, 1998a; Hung et al., \n\n2003). \n\nInside canyons, particulate matter can be transported through nepheloid layers \n\ngenerated by tidal or residual currents (Gardner, 1989; Puig &amp; Palanques, 1998b; Van \n\nWeering et al., 2002), but also, turbidity currents, slumping from the walls, and other \n\ngravitational processes have been described in contemporary submarine canyons (May et \n\nal., 1983; Ferentinos et al., 1985; Xu et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007b). \n\nTurbidity currents flowing along the canyon axis are known to occur in present times, \n\nand are documented either indirectly (for a review cf. Nisbet and Piper, 1998), or shortly \n\nbefore the measuring instruments were broken down or dragged away by the violent \n\ncurrents (Paull et al., 2003 and Khripounoff et al., 2003). A successful in situ observation \n\nof contemporary turbidity currents was achieved by Xu et al. (2002) in the Monterey \n\nCanyon. Aside from these extraordinary events, observations in the Eel Canyon have \n\ndemonstrated that sediment gravity flows of lesser magnitude but higher frequency may \n\nconstitute an important agent in the effective across-margin transport of sediments in \n\ncanyons receiving large amounts of sediment (Puig et al., 2003, 2004). \n\nThe role of a canyon as a trap or a channel for sediments may differ according to the \n\ntime-scale considered, due to redistribution processes operating on different time-scales. \n\nThis is a critical point, since the net transport in these environments may be largely \n\nevent-driven. Thus, observations within a small temporal window may lead to ambiguous \n\nmean fluxes, either dominated by exceptional events, or on the contrary, reflecting the \n\n\u201cnormal\u201d conditions of relative quiescence, missing single events that may overwhelm, in \n\nterms of net fluxes, the cumulative values between events (Mart\u00edn, 2005). \n\n \n\nThe modifications of water circulation associated to topographic features such as \n\ncanyons have important implications for marine ecosystems. By altering the main \n\ncurrents, they affect biomass patterns (Mas\u00f3 &amp; Duarte, 1989; Sabat\u00e9s et al., 1989), \n\ncomposition of phytoplankton assemblages (Estrada et al., 1999), and distribution of fish \n\nlarvae due to inshore-offshore exchange of water masses (Olivar et al., 1988; Sabat\u00e9s &amp; \n\nMas\u00f3, 1990). \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 14 \n\nUnfortunately, canyons are also prone to transport and accumulate pollution (e.g. \n\ntrace metals, Palanques et al., 2008 and Jesus et al., 2010; pesticides, Paull et al., 2002; \n\nor litter, Galgani et al., 1996), which further raises the need for research and protection. \n\nThe current multidisciplinary European project HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem \n\nResearch and Man's Impact On European Seas) envisages to give answer to questions \n\nregarding the ecology of submarine canyons, along with various other continental margin \n\necosystems, and also to focus on the impacts made by human activities on these \n\necosystems. \n\n \n\nAs a conclusion, one may notice that submarine canyons are complex systems in \n\nterms of hydrography, sedimentology, biogeochemistry and biology and great variability \n\noccurs both within individual canyon systems and between different canyons. Individual \n\ncanyons have very different environmental characteristics that determine the diversity and \n\nthe ecology of their fauna. \n\n \n\n1.3. Objectives of the present study \n\nIn various EU-projects (OMEX-II, EUROSTRATAFORM and HERMES) the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon on the Portuguese margin was an area of specific interest and as a consequence \n\nnumerous papers dealing with this canyon have been published. On the other hand, the \n\ngeographically nearby and equally huge Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon has so far received much \n\nless attention. The main goal of the present thesis is therefore to study the pathways of \n\nrecent fine-grained sediment transport on the central Portuguese continental margin with \n\nspecial focus on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent shelf area. \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 and Cascais canyons were also studied along with the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon, so that a comparison can be made between canyons with different sedimentary \n\nsetting and anthropogenic pressures. \n\nThe Sines, Estremadura and to some extent the Mondego open slopes were studied \n\nthrough cross-margin transects allowing comparison with transects in the submarine \n\ncanyon systems. \n\nThe present thesis is based on comprehensive sediment sampling and collection of \n\nhydrographic data in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, Nazar\u00e9 and Cascais submarine canyons and \n\nadjacent open slopes. In order to achieve the above goal, the compositional variability of \n\n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n 15\n\nsediments was assessed along the canyon axes in the three canyon systems. Short-term \n\nsedimentation from sediment traps was compared with the longer-term integrated \n\nsedimentary signal from core tops. The geochemical (elemental and isotopic) and \n\nmineralogical results were also integrated with data on processes and pathways of \n\nsediment transport (total mass fluxes through sediment traps, sediment accumulation \n\nrates through 210Pb geochronology, horizontal SPM fluxes) for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons. For the latter canyon, data on processes and pathways of sediment \n\ntransport were previously published by De Stigter et al. (2007b). \n\nOverall, the here presented data yield information on sedimentary processes \n\npresently operating within submarine canyons on timescales of days to decades and \n\nmore, and specifically on sources and dispersal pathways of natural and anthropogenic \n\ntrace metals affecting deep sea areas yet poorly known, such as submarine canyons. \n\n \n\nIn the next chapter a description of the central Portuguese margin will be presented \n\nfocusing especially on the submarine canyons and also on the shelf and slope adjacent to \n\nthe canyons. Since the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and the adjacent shelf and slope are the \n\ncentral topic of the present thesis, a more comprehensive description of these areas will \n\nbe given, including a description of the adjacent hinterland areas (basin watersheds and \n\ncoastal areas). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1.

Portuguese Atlantic margin \n\nThe Portuguese Atlantic margin is characterised by a narrow shelf and steep irregular \n\nslope, dissected by several deep canyons. Structural trends of the margin are determined \n\nby fault systems present in the Hercynian basement, by Mesozoic extensional tectonics \n\nrelated to the opening of the North Atlantic, and by Cenozoic compression resulting from \n\nthe collision of the European and African plates (e.g. Vanney &amp; Mougenot, 1981). The \n\npresent morphology of the margin was basically established since the Miocene, when \n\nmajor subsidence occurred and prograding sedimentary series were deposited on the \n\nshelf and slope (e.g. Alves et al., 2003). The latter were subsequently incised by canyons, \n\nwhich channelled large volumes of sediment towards submarine fans at the base of the \n\nslope. The main submarine canyons from north to south are: Porto, Aveiro, Nazar\u00e9, \n\nCascais, Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and S\u00e3o Vicente, which exhibit a very general northeast\u2013\n\nsouthwest trend (Figure 2.1). These canyons, dividing the western Iberian margin into \n\nsub-margins with different features, are the main pathways through which shelf \n\nsediments are transported to the abyssal plains (Vanney &amp; Mougenot, 1990). The sub-\n\nmargins (shelf and slope) are here referred from north to south as (Figure 2.2): \n\n\u2022 Aveiro margin between Espinho and Cape Mondego; \n\n\u2022 Mondego margin between Cape Mondego and the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon;  \n\n\u2022 Estremadura margin between the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and Cape Roca;  \n\n\u2022 Lisbon margin between Cape Roca and Cape Espichel; \n\n\u2022 Set\u00fabal margin between Cape Espichel and the Set\u00fabal Canyon; \n\n\u2022 Sines margin between the Set\u00fabal Canyon and Cape Sines. \n\n \n\nAt depths over 4500 m the Aveiro and Mondego slope run out into the Iberia Abyssal \n\nPlain, and the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines slope into the Tagus Abyssal Plain. The \n\nEstremadura spur, projecting westwards from the Estremadura margin, separates the \n\nIberia and Tagus abyssal plains (Figure 2.1). \n\nThe Minho, Douro, Mondego, Tagus (Tejo) and Sado rivers supply sediment to the \n\nshelf, which is composed of a thick (> 1000 m) Cenozoic sediment wedge draping a \n\nMesozoic substrate (Coppier &amp; Mougenot, 1982). Cliff erosion and reworking of shelf \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 18 \n\ndeposits are additional sources of recent sediment, next to biogenic sediment. Recent \n\nsediments are predominantly deposited on the shelf in a narrow belt along the shore and \n\nin mid-shelf mud patches. Further dispersal of fine-grained suspended sediment along \n\nand across the shelf occurs mainly in winter under the influence of southerly storms \n\n(Vitorino et al., 2002b; Oliveira et al., 2002). Transport of shelf sediments towards the \n\ndeeper continental margin is limited by poleward flowing slope currents, in particular the \n\nflow of Mediterranean Water on the upper continental slope (Van Weering et al., 2002). \n\nSubmarine canyons like the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon which cut deeply into the \n\ncontinental shelf, are likely to intercept the sediment transport along the shelf and provide \n\ncorridors for transport down the continental slope. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.1.

Regional setting \n\n 20 \n\nfrom Balsinha (2008) for shelf between Cape Roca and the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and Pombo (2004) for shelf north \nof the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\n  \n\n2.1.1. Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines margins \n\nThe continental shelf between Cape Raso and Cape Sines, in this study referred to as \n\nthe Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelf, has a width ranging from 3 to 30 km, with the \n\nshelfbreak located around 200 m depth (Figure 2.2). \n\nThe sedimentary cover of these shelf areas was virtually unknown until the middle \n\n1970\u2019s when the mapping of surface sediments was initiated with the SEPLAT \n\nProgramme, carried out by the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico of Portugal. Figure 2.3 showing the \n\nsedimentary cover of the study area is redrawn from the map published in 2005 by the \n\nInstituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, as a result of this programme.  \n\nThe close proximity to two rivers and protection of an important portion of the \n\ncontinental shelf from the main swell coming from the NW allowed the formation of mud \n\npatches in the shelf off the rivers. As a result of the sea-level rise since the last glaciation, \n\npaleocoast deposits can also be found in the shelf. In general, the sedimentary cover of \n\nthe Iberian margin is mainly composed of late Quaternary and Holocene sediments (Dias, \n\n1987). \n\n \n\nRiver-derived sedimentary deposits \n\nOn the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal continental shelves, sediment discharges from the Tagus \n\nand Sado estuaries have resulted in the formation of submarine protofluvial deltas in front \n\nof the river mouths. The sedimentary deposits off the Tagus River are essentially muddy \n\n(Figure 2.3). Protected against swell from the northwest, almost the entire Lisbon \n\ncontinental shelf is covered by a large expanse of muddy deposit. \n\nThe Tagus mud patch with an area of about 560 km2 is the most important riverine-\n\nderived deposit of the Portuguese margin. Sediments from this deposit are composed of \n\nmore than 85 % of terrigenous material whereas carbonate contents vary from 5 to 9 %, \n\noccasionally reaching values between 17 and 25 % (Jouanneau et al., 1998 and Alt-\n\nEpping et al., 2007). Linear sediment accumulation rates vary between 0.07 and \n\n0.18 cm year-1, with maximum values of 2.13 cm year-1 (Jouanneau et al., 1998). \n\nMuddy deposits of the Sado protofluvial delta cover only a relatively small area \n\nconfined to the river outlet, in accordance with the much smaller size of this river. The \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 21\n\nsedimentary deposits covering the continental shelf adjacent to the Sado River are mainly \n\nsandy muds. Muddy sediment areas in the Set\u00fabal shelf are restricted to the northern \n\ncoast of the bay in front of Sesimbra and to the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon (Monteiro &amp; Moita, \n\n1971; Moita &amp; Quevauviller, 1986). The sedimentary cover of the Set\u00fabal shelf is \n\npredominantly composed of terrigenous lithoclastic material, mostly quartz, whereas bulk \n\ncarbonate content is mostly below 30 % (Figure 2.4). \n\n \n\nSandy deposits of the inner and outer shelves \n\nSandy deposits occur on the inner part of the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, \n\nwhere the energy of littoral currents is sufficiently high to remove the finer sediment \n\nfractions. On the Sines shelf, coarse sandy deposits occurring on the outer shelf near the \n\nshelfbreak are a remnant of an old shoreline dated ~16 000 years B.P., which has not \n\nbecome covered by recent muddy deposits because of prevailing dynamics of the outer \n\nshelf (Dias, 1987). These deposits have carbonate contents which can exceed 50 % \n\nalthough contents below 30 % predominate (Figure 2.4). Local rock outcrops occur on all \n\nthe three shelves but are most common on the Sines shelf (Figure 2.3). \n\nWhereas the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal outer shelves around 200 m WD pass abruptly into \n\nthe steeply dipping slope leading down to the Tagus Abyssal Plain, the Sines shelf passes \n\nmore gradually into the gently dipping slope. In this area steep slopes are only found at \n\nthe intersection with the Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\n2.1.2. Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon is located on the Portuguese continental margin \n\naround 38\u00ba00\u2019-38\u00ba30\u2019N; 009\u00ba-010\u00ba30\u2019W (Figure 2.5). The Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nintersects the Portuguese margin just south of Lisbon near the mouth of the Tagus and \n\nSado rivers. It is a canyon system since it is characterised by having two upper-canyon \n\nparts: the Lisbon Canyon and the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. The head of Lisbon Canyon is \n\nlocated close to the mouth of the Tagus River, the largest river of the Iberian Peninsula. \n\nThe head of Set\u00fabal Canyon is located close to the mouth of the Sado River, a smaller \n\nriver south of the Tagus. These two branches join together at around 2010 m WD. From \n\nthe junction point onward the canyon, usually named Set\u00fabal Canyon after the longest of \n\nthe two branches, continues in WSW direction for another 127 km to the foot of the \n\ncontinental slope at 4500 m. \n\n\n\n2.

Bathymetric map of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons (from de Stigter et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nUpper Set\u00fabal Canyon and Lisbon Canyon \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon is fed by two main canyon branches, the east\u2013west-\n\noriented Set\u00fabal branch and the north\u2013south-trending Lisbon branch (Figure 2.5). The \n\nSet\u00fabal branch canyon head is located at 38\u00b018?45?N, 8\u00b052?49?W, at ~90 m WD, 20 km \n\nsouth-southwest of the Sado River mouth and 6 km west of the nearest coastline between \n\nTr\u00f3ia and Sines. The branch cuts 45 km into the continental shelf with low sinuosity, \n\nalthough in its shallowest course it displays some open meanders; this section has a width \n\nof less than 8 km from edge to edge (section 9 of Figure 2.6c). Small terraces can be \n\nidentified in TOBI imagery, both in its northern and southern walls (Lastras et al., 2009) \n\n(Figure 2.7e). \n\nThe Lisbon branch canyon head is located at 38\u00b033?15?N and 9\u00b016?48?W, at ~120 m \n\nwater depth, 13 km south-southwest of the Tagus River mouth, and 5 km west of the \n\nnearest coastline. It cuts 28 km into the shelf and is sinuous, with a total length of 38 km, \n\ndue to a series of sharp meanders entrenched between high gullied walls (Figure 2.7c and \n\nFigure 6.2). A straight escarpment marks the western wall down slope of the major \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 24 \n\nmeanders, where the canyon axis straightens (Figure 2.7c) before its almost \n\nperpendicular junction with the Set\u00fabal branch at 38\u00b017?38?N and 9\u00b019?39?W around \n\n2010 m WD. \n\nThe along-canyon profiles of the Set\u00fabal (C\u2013C2 in Figure 2.6c) and Lisbon (C\u2013C1 in \n\nFigure 2.6c) branches differ substantially. The Lisbon branch displays a concave \n\nbathymetric profile that matches the profile of the Set\u00fabal Canyon at water depths \n\nexceeding 2010 m. It is also parallel to the bathymetric profile of the lower part of the \n\nSet\u00fabal branch, that is, between 1420 and 2010 m. However, that parallelism disappears \n\nupslope of 1420 m WD. There, the Set\u00fabal branch displays a convex morphology with a \n\nknick point at 1040 m WD and high slope gradients in the canyon axis between 1040 and \n\n1420 m WD (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.6c). \n\nThere is a third, minor branch (C\u2013C3 in Figures 2.6a and c), which starts at ~250 m \n\nWD and joins the middle course of the Set\u00fabal Canyon at 2165 m WD, hanging 350 m \n\nover the canyon axis (section 8 in Figure 2.6c). \n\n \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon - middle course  \n\nThe middle course of the Set\u00fabal Canyon is more than 25 km wide (from edge to \n\nedge) in some areas and 70 km long, measured from the confluence of the Lisbon and \n\nSet\u00fabal branches at 2010 m down to the Set\u00fabal Canyon mouth (the area where the \n\ncanyon widens onto the lower portion) at 4170 m WD. Most of the middle course is \n\ncharacterised by a flat-bottomed canyon axis. This is most evident between 2150 and \n\n2320 m WD, where a 500 m wide thalweg just upslope of a 110\u00b0 sharp meander and a \n\nnumber of terraces in the northern wall can be identified, together with an over deepened \n\npond (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.7g). \n\nSome short sections show, on the contrary, V-shaped axes, as happens in a north\u2013\n\nsouth-oriented straight section at ~2600 m WD. In this part, the Set\u00fabal Canyon is \n\nstrongly incised. The external walls of meanders in the middle course show evidence of \n\nintensive gullying. The final part of the middle course, between 3700 and 4170 m WD, \n\ndisplays a striking variety of sedimentary processes (Lastras et al., 2009). A flat-bottomed \n\nand slightly incised canyon thalweg of up to 1 km wide is bounded to the south by up to \n\nfour levels of terraces, each more than 200 m wide. These terraces are swept by material \n\ncoming from a 1200 m-wide notch in the southern wall and, down-slope, by a linear \n\nescarpment at the base of the southern wall. Large blocks and debris are clearly visible \n\nbelow this escarpment (Figure 2.7f), according to Lastras et al. (2009). \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 25\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6.

Two cross-canyon sections (1 and 2 in B) \nfor the Cascais Canyon, five (6 to 9 and 0 in C) for the Set\u00fabal\u2013Lisbon Canyon, whereas three more (3 to 5, \ndrawn separately between B and C) are common for both Cascais and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons. Crossing \npoints between longitudinal and cross sections are marked with a label that corresponds to the colour of the \nlongitudinal section and number of the cross section. \n\n \n\n \n\nSet\u00fabal Lower Canyon \n\nAt 4170 m WD, the Set\u00fabal Canyon abruptly widens and opens onto the lower part \n\nthrough the Set\u00fabal Canyon mouth. The northern wall of the canyon mouth region \n\ndisplays pervasive signs of grooving. The first 11.5 km of the lower part, between 4170 \n\nand 4460 m WD, display a flat-bottomed, 1.9 km-wide thalweg bounded by high, steep \n\nwalls (Figure 2.7f). The canyon thalweg gradually widens up to 5 km over the following \n\n25 km, where tributaries join it from both walls. The thalweg is composed generally of \n\nhigh backscatter deposits in this section, with small low backscatter spots (Figure 2.7b). \n\nAccording to Arzola et al. (2008) the largest failure deposit from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon occurs in this area. Seismic shaking was interpreted as the likely cause of such a \n\nlocalised slope failure event on the northern levee. Over the following 11 km, i.e., \n\nbetween 46 and 57 km downslope from the canyon mouth, the thalweg has a very low \n\nslope gradient, and gains only 40 m in depth, from 4820 to 4860 m WD; beyond this \n\npoint the canyon opens gradually onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Figure 2.2). Between 46 \n\nand 57 km, close to the southern rim, the thalweg displays evident signs of erosion, with \n\nelongated scours perpendicular to the canyon direction (Figure 2.7d). These scours tend \n\nto be orientated parallel to the canyon axis in the central parts of the thalweg. The \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon finally opens out onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain 57 km away from the \n\ncanyon mouth, but its influence can be traced much farther away. TOBI imagery shows \n\npervasive chevron-shaped scouring and other erosional morphologies 95 km away from \n\nthe canyon mouth (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.7a). \n\n\n\n2.

Cascais Canyon \n\nThe Cascais Canyon is incised in the shelf edge and slope northwest of the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (Figure 2.5), being separated from the latter by the Afonso de \n\nAlbuquerque plateau (Vanney &amp; Mougenot, 1981). Compared to the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons it is the shortest in length, taking almost 90 km in an open U-turn to \n\ncover a straight-line distance of 62 km between canyon head and mouth. Since it spans a \n\ndepth range similar to that of the other two, it is also the steepest one, with slope \n\ngradients typically exceeding 10\u00b0 (Lastras et al., 2009). \n\nThe Cascais Canyon head has a very complex morphology when compared to the \n\nother central Portuguese canyons, with multiple branches and gullies slightly incised in \n\nthe shelf edge (see Figure 2.6b, section 2), reflecting an initial phase in submarine canyon \n\nevolution (Twichell &amp; Roberts, 1982; Farre et al., 1983 in Lastras et al., 2009). It displays \n\npervasive gullying of its walls, has a 4.2 km wide V-shaped morphology and is incised up \n\nto 1350 m below the continental shelf. \n\nThe middle course of the Cascais Canyon runs from 2200 down to 4510 m WD, a \n\ndistance of 43 km across the continental slope and base of slope. It is the most sinuous \n\nsection of the canyon. In contrast to the upper section, which has an almost north\u2013south \n\nmean direction of 196\u00b0, the middle section trends east\u2013west. It has a width of up to \n\n22 km, and is incised as much as 1800 m. Although the four axial incisions, corresponding \n\nto the four branches of the canyon, have joined to form one single axis, numerous gullies \n\nstill enter the Cascais Canyon through its northern wall, whereas the southern wall is \n\nsmoother and more regular. A wide canyon axis characterises the first part of the middle \n\ncourse, between 2200 and 3300 m WD, with slope gradients not exceeding 8\u00b0 (see Figure \n\n2.6b). In contrast, between 3300 and 4510 m WD, the Cascais Canyon thalweg is \n\nsteeper, with slope gradients in places exceeding 15\u00b0 and with widespread evidence of \n\nerosion, like grooving both in the thalweg and in the canyon walls, thalweg escarpments \n\nand over-deepened ponds (Lastras et al., 2009). \n\nThe steep final part of the middle course of the Cascais Canyon opens at 4510 m WD \n\ninto the lower-canyon. The lower part of the Cascais Canyon has a smooth, flat-bottomed \n\nand less incised valley, which in turn opens out into the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Figures 2.1 \n\nand 2.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 29\n\n2.1.4. Mondego and Estremadura margins \n\nThe Mondego margin has a shelf which varies from 65 km in width in its northern \n\npart down to 45 km close to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The main features of this portion of the \n\nPortuguese shelf are the mid-shelf rock outcrops in the north and a mid-shelf mud patch \n\nin the vicinity of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. This middle shelf deposit, sub-parallel to the \n\nbathymetry, is 38 km long and 11 km wide (in average) but only 1-2 m thick. It is \n\nessentially formed by coarse silt, showing relatively high percentages of clay material \n\n(38 %) (Oliveira et al., 2007). The rest of the shelf is composed of sandy sediments. In \n\nthe area where rock outcrops occur, sandy sediments have gravel contents higher than \n\n25 % (Dias, 1987). According to this same author, similar sediments can also be found \n\nhalf way between the Cape Mondego and the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head in a 20 km long \n\ndeposit sub-parallel to the 50 m WD bathymetric line. \n\nThe Estremadura margin (also known as the Estremadura Spur) is composed of a \n\nshelf about 70 km wide at its largest extension and a slope spur projecting to the West \n\n(Figure 2.2). To the North and South the Estremadura spur has steep and irregular \n\nslopes, incised by numerous deep valleys, some of which act as tributaries to the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nand Cascais canyons. In its lower part the spur separates the Iberia and Tagus abyssal \n\nplains. The Estremadura shelf is dominated by rocky outcrops, rising up next to lower \n\nlying areas which act as traps for coarse sediment. Especially between 70 and 130 m WD \n\nthe terrain is very rough (Badagola et al., 2006). The sediment traps are filled by coarse \n\nsand and gravely sediment (Balsinha, 2008) and normally the sediment column does not \n\nexceed 8 m (Badagola et al., 2006). There is a muddy area, surrounded by rocky \n\noutcrops, just southwards from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The patch is 4 to 6 m thick (Pombo, \n\n2004) and sediments have clay percentages around 28 % (Duarte, 2002). In the inner \n\nshelf, close to the canyon head, fine to very fine sandy sediments are found. \n\n \n\n2.1.5. Nazar\u00e9 Canyon  \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon with an axial length of more than 200 km is among the largest \n\ncanyons of the European continental margin (Figure 2.8). It is located between 39\u00ba25\u2019N \n\nand 39\u00ba50\u2019N, bounded eastward by the low coastal hills and cliff-coast of the Estremadura \n\nregion, and sloping westward into the 5000 m deep Iberian Abyssal Plain. The most \n\naccepted theory about the canyon\u2019s tectonic setting states that the incision of the canyon \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 30 \n\naround 39\u00ba40\u2019N is largely determined by an E-W trending transpressive faultzone \n\naffecting the Paleozoic basement and Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary strata of the \n\nmargin, and which forms the seaward continuation of the late Paleozoic NE-SW trending \n\nNazar\u00e9 fault on land (Vanney &amp; Mougenot, 1990). The uplifted and deformed \n\nEstremadura promontory south of the faultzone delineates the southern boundary of the \n\ncanyon. The lower-lying northern faultblock forms the broad shelf and slope north of the \n\ncanyon. Another theory, however, assumes a more complex interplay between different \n\nfaults forming the main valley of the canyon. According to this theory the faults that \n\ndetermine the canyon do not continue on land (Dinis, 2006). \n\nAccording to the subdivision of the canyon used by De Stigter et al. (2007b) \n\nessentially following that of Vanney &amp; Mougenot (1990), the upper part of the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon is a sharp V-shaped valley that is deeply incised into the shelf and steep upper \n\nslope, and which descends from the shoreline to 2700 m depth over a length of 60 km \n\nmeasured along the canyon axis (Figure 2.9, sections f, g, h, i). \n\nThe main valley follows relatively straight sections of a few kilometres long, trending \n\nalternatingly in NE-SW and NW-SE direction parallel to the dominant structural trends of \n\nthe shelf.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8. Bathymetric map of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and adjacent open slope and shelf (from De Stigter et \nal., 2004). \n\n \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon forms a canyon system as the upper canyon has one short side-\n\nvalley branching off in NE direction from the main valley, known as the Vit\u00f3ria branch. In \n\nthe canyon head, very fine mud covers the walls, whereas sand is present on the canyon \n\nthalweg below a drape of mud. \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 31\n\nThe middle part of the canyon is a broad meandering valley, incised into the middle \n\nslope and descending from 2700 to 4000 m depth over 50 km. The main valley has \n\nterraced slopes and a V-shaped axial channel (Figure 2.9, section d). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. (adapted from Lastras et al. 2009) a) Bathymetric map of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon with location of \nlongitudinal sections A\u2013A1 (dark blue), A\u2013A2 (red, main section) and A\u2013A3 (light green) along the three main \nbranches of the canyon, and cross sections a to i (dashed black lines), illustrated in panel b. Colour of each \nsection corresponds with colours in panel b. \nb) Sections along and across the three main branches of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. For the main branch of the \nNazar\u00e9 Canyon system an along-canyon slope gradient is also shown. Nine cross-canyon sections (a to i in A) \nhave been drawn for the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. Crossing points between longitudinal and across sections are \nmarked with a label that corresponds to the colour of the longitudinal section and number of the cross \nsection. \n\n \n\nThe lower-canyon, located on the lower continental slope, is a flat-floored valley with \n\none or two incised axial channels, flanked to the south by the structurally defined Pacheco \n\nDuarte ridge and to the north by the up to 1 kilometre high sedimentary levee known as \n\nthe Gil Vicente ridge (Figure 2.8). The lower-canyon valley descends very gently from \n\n4000 to 5000 m depth over a length of 100 km and its flat-bottomed thalweg gradually \n\nincreases in width from about 3 km to over 15 km. The ridges flanking the valley decrease \n\nin height in westward direction until they end on the abyssal plain. The construction of \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 32 \n\nthe northern levee has been attributed to northward deflection of turbiditic sediments \n\ntransported through the canyon by Coriolis forcing (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1984; Vanney &amp; \n\nMougenot, 1990 in De Stigter et al., 2007b). \n\n \n\n2.1.6. Oceanographic setting \n\nTides and wave climate \n\nOn the Portuguese coast, the dominant tide is semi-diurnal with a period of 12.25 \n\nhours, moving from south to north. In the Sines harbour the tidal amplitude varies from \n\n3.4 m during spring tides to 0.7 m during neap tides (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, 1990). \n\nThe Portuguese coastal area is exposed to the highly energetic North Atlantic swells. \n\nAccording to Costa et al. (2001), the dominant wave directions are from NW and W \n\n(97 %), with the SW direction representing only 3 % of the observations. Waves with \n\nheights of 1-2 m and periods of 5-7 s represent almost half of the observations (49 % \n\nand 44 %, respectively). During storm events (3 % of the observations) waves are as \n\nhigh as 5-6 m with peak periods of 9-13 s. \n\nData recorded by the wave-rider buoy off Sines between 1992 and 1999 (Table 2.1) \n\nfits well to the general data for the Portuguese coast presented above. In northward \n\ndirection from Sines towards Tr\u00f3ia there is an increasing sheltering effect of Cape Espichel \n\nwhich reduces the wave energy and deflects the incoming waves from the NW. In the \n\nnorthern part of the Tr\u00f3ia peninsula the waves are deflected so much as to arrive from \n\nSW directions, causing a northwards longshore drift. The same occurs on the coastal arc \n\nbetween Trafaria and Cape Espichel where a northwards increase of the sheltering effect \n\nis caused by Cape Roca. \n\nIn the above dataset collected between 1992 and 1999, the mean significant wave \n\nheight (Hs) was 1.65 m, with a maximum of 7.69 m. The most energetic wave conditions \n\n(monthly Hs mean > 2.0 m) and the highest numbers of single records corresponding to \n\nstorms (Hs > 5 m) were measured in November, December and January (Miranda, 2006). \n\n \n\nHydrological conditions of the Portuguese margin  \n\nThe water column in the study area consists of several water masses (Fi\u00faza et al., \n\n1998; Garcia et al., 2003). At the surface, below the seasonally varying thermocline, a \n\nwarm (11-15 \u00baC) and salty (? 36.0 psu) body of Eastern North Atlantic Central Water \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 33\n\n(ENACW) can be distinguished (Figure 2.10). This water mass has a low concentration of \n\nsuspended particles (~8-15 \u00b5g/l), although intermediate layers are observed with higher \n\nturbidity (Hall et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

The MOW flows northwards along the western \n\nIberian continental slope in a narrow vein of 100 to 150 km width, with a mean current \n\nvelocity of approximately 12 cm s-1. An upper core of MOW closely follows the continental \n\nslope, whereas a lower core of MOW meanders west and northwestwards (Sch\u00f6nfeld, \n\n1997 and references therein).  \n\nThe North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) dominates below the MOW (between 1500 \n\nand 3000 m WD), with cooler (2-6 \u00baC) and less salty (~35.0 psu) properties. This water \n\nmass consists of a mix of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water and Labrador Sea Water (Van \n\nAken, 2000b). \n\nThe relatively thin (~200 m WD) superficial water layer flowing along the Portuguese \n\nmargin is influenced by fresh water inputs from rivers and by wind stress which are \n\nvariable throughout the year. Vertical movements associated with upwelling and \n\ndownwelling essentially occur within this superficial water layer. \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 34 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.10.

Regional setting \n\n 35\n\nWinters (typically December \u2013 January) are characterised by prevailing southerly \n\nwinds often associated with storms, leading to downwelling and offshore Ekman transport \n\n(Vitorino et al., 2002a). Under these conditions a northward flow of relatively warm water \n\noccurs over the continental shelf, which is known as the Portugal Coastal Countercurrent \n\n(PCCC). As a result of the accumulation of water in the coastal area a downward flux \n\noccurs over the shelf with bottom currents directed offshore (Vitorino et al., 2002b). \n\nIntense winter storms appear capable of eroding sediments at mid-shelf depths, and in \n\ncombination with an offshore-directed bottom flow this leads to offshore transport of fine-\n\ngrained sediments in the form of bottom nepheloid layers (Vitorino et al., 2002a, b). \n\nDuring summer northerly winds prevail, leading to development of an upwelling \n\nregime, which is most active between June and September (Huthnance et al., 2002). \n\nAlthough a southward superficial current is formed over the shelf, the northwards current \n\nover the shelf edge and upper slope continues to exist. The upwelled water is fed by the \n\nENACW of either sub-tropical (ENACWst) or sub-polar (ENACWsp) origin, which forms the \n\npermanent thermocline at water depths below approximately 100 m. Depending on the \n\nwind strength both types of water can be upwelled. The poleward flowing ENACWst is \n\nlighter, relatively warmer and saltier than southward flowing ENACWsp and contains less \n\nnutrients. The ENACWst is formed along the Azores front during winter and then \n\ncontributes to the PCCC. The ENACWsp, which flows below the sub-tropical ENACWst is \n\nformed in the eastern North Atlantic around 46\u00baN (Fi\u00faza, 1984; Fi\u00faza et al. 1998; R\u00edos et \n\nal., 1992). \n\nWhen seasonal coastal upwelling predominates off western Iberia, the upwelled \n\nwater forms a cold and nutrient-rich band of water along the west coast (Figure 2.11a, b, \n\nc). This water is transported southwards by the Portugal Coastal Current (PCC) in a band \n\nof about 50 km wide, as documented by satellite infrared images (Figure 2.11a). The \n\ndifferent upwelling patterns off western Iberia are largely determined by the bathymetry, \n\nthe coastal morphology, and local wind conditions (northerly wind along the west coast). \n\nFilaments and plumes of cold water with high pigment concentrations are modulated by \n\ntopographic features like submarine ridges and capes (Figure 2.11). Such filaments can \n\nextend as far as 200 km (e.g. off Lisbon - 39\u00baN, Cape Roca). Plumes are observed south \n\nof Cape Espichel and Sines (Figure 2.11b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

Regional Climate \n\nThe continental Portuguese territory is located at the boundary between the \n\nsubtropical anticyclone zone and the subpolar low-pressure zone (SPLZ). The subtropical \n\nanticyclone zone (high-pressure zone) is known as the Azores Anticyclone (Azores High) \n\nin the Atlantic Ocean. This high-pressure cell is neither permanent nor stationary. In \n\nsummer the Azores Anticyclone shifts NW towards the Iberian Peninsula, causing ridging \n\nacross France, northern Germany and the SE United Kingdom (Naya, 1984). During this \n\nperiod, the boundary between the Azores High and the SPLZ normally stays north of \n\n45 \u00baN and so the Portuguese continental territory is under the influence of subtropical \n\nanticyclonic air masses which may affect the country for long periods (Brito, 1994). In the \n\nwinter, the Azores High moves SE South of the Azores Islands and the limit between the \n\nSPLZ and Azores High may shift southward to latitudes around 30 \u00baN. During this period, \n\ncontinental Portugal, especially the northern part, is under influence of the subpolar \n\ndepressions characterised by humid and cold air accompanied by abundant precipitation.  \n\nApart from the large-scale pressure fields over the NE Atlantic, local factors such as \n\nthe orography, the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the continentality are responsible \n\nfor significant lateral and temporal variation in air temperature and precipitation. For \n\ninstance, the orography change along the country is responsible for the decrease of \n\nprecipitation from north to south, from annual values higher than 3000 mm in the north \n\nto less than 400 mm in the south. The Tagus valley approximately marks the transition \n\nbetween the temperate and humid climate of the northern Portugal and the warm and dry \n\nclimate of the south. \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 38 \n\n2.3. Hinterland areas adjacent to the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines margin \n\n2.3.1. Coastal area \n\nThe coast adjacent to the study area consists of two broad arc segments: Tr\u00f3ia - \n\nSines and Trafaria - Espichel, almost homothetic in trend, shape and boundaries. The \n\nnorthern boundary of each \n\nsegment is a major estuary \n\n(Sado and Tagus, respectively). \n\nBetween the Sado Estuary and \n\nCape Espichel the coastline is \n\ndetermined by the E-W trending \n\nArr\u00e1bida Mountains chain. \n\nSimilarly, the rocky coastline \n\nnorth of the Tagus Estuary \n\nextends westwards until the \n\nCape Raso (Figure 2.12). The \n\nsouthern boundaries are \n\ndefined by Cape Sines and Cape \n\nEspichel, respectively. Both \n\ncoastal arcs include a northern \n\nsection with low lying beaches \n\nand dunes and a central and \n\nsouthern section with Mio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs (see Figure 2.13 for illustrations from the \n\nTr\u00f3ia \u2013 Sines arc). In some places these outcrops can reach 40 m height. Sea-cliffs of \n\nthese areas are mainly composed of detritic sedimentary sequences dating from the \n\nMiocene (silty-clayey sands, clays and calcareous arenites) and from Pliocene-Pleistocene \n\n(finesands to coursesands, gravels, clays and ferruginous crusts) (Quevauviller, 1988; \n\nMarques, 1999; Gomes, 1992 and Gama, 2004). \n\n Both arcs have also lagoons in their southern parts: Melides, Santo Andr\u00e9 and \n\nSancha Lagoons in the Tr\u00f3ia-Sines arc and Albufeira Lagoon in the Trafaria-Espichel arc  \n\nFigure 2.12.

Regional setting \n\n 40 \n\n(Figure 2.12 and 2.13). These lagoons have as common feature a narrow, linear and \n\nreflective sand barrier which is attached to the mainland at both ends. In the Santo \n\nAndr\u00e9, Melides and Albufeira lagoons an ephemeral tidal inlet is artificially and regularly \n\nopened to promote water exchange, to prevent eutrophication and to drain the nearby \n\nalluvial plains which are reclaimed for agriculture and which are silting up by natural \n\nmeans (Freitas et al., 2002). \n\nThe Tr\u00f3ia \u2013 Sines coastal arc is delimited to the south by Cape Sines, an outcrop of \n\nsub-volcanic rocks of Late Cretaceous age, which more inland are covered below Cenozoic \n\nsand and gravel (Figure 2.17). Seismic reflection and field sampling in the adjacent shelf \n\nindicates that the sub-volcanic massif extends seawards over an area of about 12 x \n\n3.5 km (Inverno et al., 1993). The emerged part is composed of basic and intermediate \n\nigneous rocks (gabbros, diorites and syenites) surrounded by a dense field of basic \n\nigneous dykes (Inverno et al., 1993). \n\nBetween both coastal arcs stands the Arr\u00e1bida coast, extending between Cape \n\nEspichel and the Sado River and defined by an E-W trending fault delimiting the uplifted \n\nMesozoic Arr\u00e1bida Mountain chain. This tectonically controlled coastal area is much higher \n\ncompared to the nearby coastal arcs with an altitude of 380 m at the summit of Risco \n\nMountain. It is dominated by calcareous rocks and beaches occur mainly as pocket \n\nbeaches in small bays protected against the main swell (e.g. Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida). \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Hydrological basins \n\nThe main fluvial systems debouching on the central Portuguese margin are the Tagus \n\n(Tejo) River, draining an area of more than 80,000 km2 and with a mean annual \n\ndischarge of 16 x 109 m3 y-1, and the much smaller Sado River, which has an order of \n\nmagnitude lower drainage area and annual discharge (Figure 2.14). \n\nFluvial networks have been extensively modified after the 1940s, especially by the \n\nconstruction of multiple dams and reservoirs for water storage, energy production and \n\nflood control, which has dramatically reduced the sediment yield to the coast (Figure \n\n2.15). Also more sediment has been progressively retained within the drainage area due \n\nto the changes in land-use. Specifically, reforestation programs and soil conservation \n\npractices in agriculture have been growing in importance since the last quarter of the 20th \n\ncentury. In addition, the mining of sand and shingle from river beds and flood plains for \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 41\n\nconstruction and navigation has been steadily growing throughout the 20th century, \n\nenhancing the sediment storage capacity of fluvial systems, and as a result leading to the \n\nundersaturation of the potential longshore drift and starvation of the coast. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.14. The hydrologic basins of the Tagus and Sado rivers. \n\n \nFigure 2.15. (adapted from Dias, 1990) Original source areas of fluvial sediment discharge to the \nPortuguese margin, and present day effective source areas resulting from the construction of dams. \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 42 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, during the present high sea-level stand, estuaries tend to work as \n\nsediment traps, especially for the coarser bedload sediment, and therefore the sediment \n\ntransported to the adjacent sea consists mostly of fine-grained suspended material. \n\nIn the Plan of the Tagus Hydrographic Basin (Procesl et al., 1999) 2043 dams were \n\nidentified in the Portuguese part of the Tagus basin. Fourteen of these are important \n\ndams with storage capacity > 10 hm3. Presently the Tagus supplies less than 1/3 of its \n\npotential solid load to the inner estuary (Ramos &amp; Reis, 2001). According to Procesl et al. \n\n(1999), under natural conditions the Tagus River has a capacity to transport 1,200,000 m3 \n\ny-1 of sediment through traction and saltation. Between 1956 and 1966 the mean \n\nsediment transport capacity of the river decreased to 530,000 m3 y-1 and it was estimated \n\nto be around 350,000 m3 y-1 for the year 2000. \n\nIn 1999 around 800 dams were identified in the Sado Basin (Hidroprojecto et al., \n\n1999). Most of them (>700) are small dams, together representing around 9 hm3 of water \n\nstorage capacity, whereas 8 are considered to be significant ones, each with a storage \n\ncapacity > 10 hm3. \n\n \n\nTagus (Tejo) Basin \n\nThe Tagus River is the longest river of the Iberian Peninsula with a length of more \n\nthan 1100 km and a drainage area of 80,629 km2 covering an important part of central \n\nand western Iberia. Approximately 30 % of the drainage area is on Portuguese territory. \n\nThe mean annual discharge of the Tagus is 16 x 109 m3 y-1, with interannual variation \n\nranging between 3 x 109 and 23 x 109 m3 y-1 (e.g. Benito et al., 2003). Monthly average \n\ndischarge varies from 0.03 x 109 to 69 x 109 m3 y-1 (Loureiro, 1979; Loureiro &amp; Macedo, \n\n1986). \n\nThe Tagus drainage basin can be subdivided in four parts, each with distinctive \n\nmorphological and hydrological characteristics, on the basis of different geological setting \n\n(Figure 2.16): 1) the Iberian Range (at the head); 2) the NE Cenozoic basin (upper \n\ncourse); 3) the Hesperian Massif (middle course); and 4) the SW Cenozoic basin (lower \n\ncourse). \n\nThe Tagus River head (from its source to Saced\u00f3n) is located in the Iberian Range, a \n\nNW\u2013SE-trending Alpine chain consisting of Mesozoic sedimentary strata (Triassic \n\nfeldspathic sandstones, Jurassic and Cretaceous marine carbonates and subarkosic \n\nsandstones) (Arribas &amp; Tortosa, 2003). \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 43\n\nThe upper course (from Saced\u00f3n to Navalmoral) lies embedded in continental \n\nclastics, carbonates and tabular evaporites of Neogene age. In this segment, the \n\nnorthwest watershed of the drainage area is situated in the Central System, a \n\nmountainous range that consists of a large exposure of granitoids that intrude pre-\n\nHercynian metamorphic basement. \n\nThe middle course (from Navalmoral to Abrantes) cuts low-grade metamorphic rocks \n\n(Precambrian greywacke and slates, Cambrian slates and quartzites and associated \n\nintruding granitoids) from the Central Iberian Zone in the Hesperian Massif. \n\nThe lower course of the Tagus River (from Abrantes to Lisbon) is developed on the \n\nSW Cenozoic basin which continues into the Sado drainage area (Freire, 1993). The \n\ntabular arrangement of the Tertiary detrital deposits favours the wandering course of the \n\nTagus River, with a wide alluvial plain with meander bars and a well-developed system of \n\nQuaternary terraces. Estuarine deposits are also present near the river mouth. Head \n\nstreams of tributaries at the north and south also drain Jurassic carbonate and \n\nmetamorphic terranes from the Hesperian Massif, respectively, cropping out at the edges \n\nof the Neogene basin (Figure 2.16). \n\nAccording to Pera &amp; Arribas (2004), most of the sand deposited on the Tagus Estuary \n\nis derived from the erosion of Mesozoic carbonates and Tertiary to Quaternary detrital \n\nsediments at the distal margin of the drainage basin. \n\nThe average suspended sediment load discharged by the Tagus into the estuary is 4 \n\nx 105 t y-1 but may reach 1 x 106 t y-1 during years when there are several flood events \n\n(Vale &amp; Sundby, 1987). In the Tagus Estuary, the SPM concentration is considered to be \n\nlow, with values typically &lt;30 mg l-1 (C\u00e2mara et al., 1986), but with a great variability in \n\ntime and space, related to the discharge of the Tagus River and meteorological and tidal \n\ndynamics in the estuary. Vale (1981) recorded a maximum value of turbidity in the order \n\nof 500 mg l-1 in the upper estuary during spring tide. Although the tide is important for \n\nthe transport of water, sediments export to the shelf, estimated at 1 \u2013 77 x 106 t y-1, \n\nappears largely driven by exceptional storms and river floods (Bettencourt et al., 1980; \n\nVale, 1981). According to Valente &amp; da Silva (2009), precipitation, river discharge and \n\nwinds, increase the turbid plume issuing from the Tagus Estuary, but the fortnightly cycle \n\nappears to be superimposed on the large time-scale variability. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 44 \n\nSado Basin and coastal lagoons \n\nThe Sado drainage basin comprises an area of approximately 7,737 km2 (Miranda, \n\n2007) limited to the north by the Tagus basin, to the east by the Guadiana basin and to \n\nthe south by the Mira basin. To the West there are several creeks which flow directly to \n\nthe sea. \n\nThe Sado River (the main watercourse of the basin) is a small river compared to the \n\nTagus River spanning only 180 km from its origin in the Vigia Mountains (230 m high) to \n\nthe point where it flows into the sea. It has an annual mean discharge of 1.2 x 109 m3 y-1 \n\n(Cabe\u00e7adas, 1993) with pronounced seasonal variability (peak values in February / March \n\nand minima in August) and large interannual variations (e.g. Trigo et al., 2004) resulting \n\nin highly variable suspended sediment loads (Vale, 1990; Vale et al., 1993).  \n\nThe water flow within the estuary is mainly controlled by the tide, as fresh water \n\ninflow from the Sado and a number of smaller rivers is insufficient to have a significant \n\ninfluence on circulation (Bettencourt &amp; Ramos, 2003). \n\nThe geology of the Sado Basin is dominated by Paleozoic and Cenozoic deposits \n\nwhich occupy 49 and 47 % of the basin surface, respectively (Miranda, 2007). The \n\nremaining 4 % represent Jurassic limestones, marls, dolomites and dolomitic limestones \n\nof the Arr\u00e1bida and Grandola Mountains and some outcrops of post-Hercynian intrusive \n\nrocks (Figure 2.17) of which the outcrop at Cape Sines is the most relevant to this study. \n\nPaleozoic outcrops in the Sado Basin can be divided in two main groups: 1) low \n\ngrade metamorphic sediments and 2) igneous rocks and medium to high grade \n\nmetamorphic sediments. According to Pimentel (1997), the first group consists mainly of \n\nschist and greywacke which are not very resistant to weathering and thus yield mica-rich \n\nand clayey sediments. The occurrence of quartz veins associated to late periods of schist \n\ndeformation is the main source of clastic quartz. The second group characterised by \n\nweathering resistant outcrops, comprises felsitic gneisses, rhyodacite porphyry, granular \n\nbasic and ultrabasic rocks and granular acid and intermediate-acid rocks. \n\nCenozoic rocks are found throughout the basin especially in the central and coastal \n\nareas. In general, Tertiary deposits consist of clays, sands, arenites, gravels and \n\ncalcareous rocks / limestones (Figure 2.17). According to Pimentel (1997), these deposits \n\nwere produced by weathering of Paleozoic rocks. Quaternary deposits consist essentially \n\nof gravel beds and sands occurring in alluvial channels and terraces, dunes and beaches. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Regional setting \n\n 45\n\nFigure 2.16.

The Melides lagoon receives the discharge of a small brook which has the \n\nsame name as the lagoon. The small basin has an area of ~60 km2 of which 38 % \n\ncorresponds to Carboniferous greywackes, different types of schists and also volcanic \n\ntuffs.

Cruises and sampling gear \n\nSurface sediment samples from the continental shelf and upper slope between the \n\nTagus River mouth and Cape Sines were collected between 1980 and 1987 during several \n\ncruises conducted within the framework of Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico\u2019s internal project \n\nSEPLAT. Hundred and seventeen sediment samples were collected from water depths \n\nbetween 1 and 572 m (Figure 3.1). These samples, representing approximately the first \n\n15 cm of the sediment column, were collected using Shipeck, Van Veen and Smith \n\nMcIntyre grabs. \n\nSediment samples and other data presented from Portuguese canyons and open \n\nslopes were recovered during a series of cruises with RV \u201cPelagia\u201d of the Royal \n\nNetherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), conducted in November 2002, March \n\n2003, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, August/September 2006 and May/June \n\n2007 (cruises 64PE204, 64PE208, 64PE218, 64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252, 64PE269, \n\nrespectively). Subsequently, stations are referred to by cruise number combined with \n\nstation number (e.g. 204-23). Sampling locations are shown in Figure 3.2 and positions \n\nare given in Appendix Tables A1.1 and A1.2. Location of samples from the Mondego \n\ntransect are shown in Appendix A2. \n\nFifty box-, multi- and piston-cores were studied: 19 from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, 16 from \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and 5 from the Cascais Canyon (Figure 3.2, Appendix Table \n\nA1.3). Ten more multi-cores collected in the open slope away from the canyons were also \n\nstudied (open slope transects). All sediment cores were stored at 4\u00b0C for later analysis. \n\nLoss of surface sediment resulting from impact of the corer on the seabed is considered \n\nminimal since the oxidized surface sediment layer and intact arborescent foraminifera \n\nwere commonly preserved in the top of the cores (Figure 3.3) (De Stigter et al., 2007b). \n\nThe MUC 8+4 multiple corer developed by Oktopus GmbH was equipped with an \n\narray of eight 6-cm diameter and four 10-cm diameter polycarbonate coring tubes of \n\n61 cm length (Figure 3.4a). One of the 10-cm diameter polycarbonate tubes was usually \n\nreplaced by a PVC tube of equal diameter, used for sedimentological analysis. The \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 50 \n\nstandard boxcorer developed by NIOZ is equipped with a cylindrical coring barrel of 30 cm \n\ndiameter and 55 cm length (Figure 3.4b). Upon retrieval a lid closes off the top of the \n\ncoring barrel, allowing recovery of relatively undisturbed cores complete with overlying \n\nwater. \n\nThe NIOZ pistoncorer consists of a steel coring barrel of 6 or 12 m length with lead \n\nweight of about 1500 kg (Figure 3.4c). The coring barrel had an 11-cm diameter plastic \n\nliner, a teflon head with core catcher and adjustable piston regulating the pressure inside \n\nthe liner during coring. A trip weight of 100 kg with a smaller size coring barrel was used \n\nto release the pistoncorer for a free fall at about 3 m above the bottom. \n\nMass deposition flux, current dynamics, temperature, salinity and turbidity in the \n\nnear-bottom water layer were measured with three BOBO (BOttom BOundary) benthic \n\nlanders developed by Royal NIOZ (Van Weering et al., 2000) (Figure 3.4d, e). \n\n \n\n3.1.2. BOBO landers and sediment traps \n\nThe 4 meter high tripod landers designated as BOBO were each equipped with an \n\nRDI 1200 kHz ADCP facing downward at 2 m a.b. (above bottom), SeaBird conductivity \n\nand temperature sensor at 3 m a.b., SeaPoint optical backscatter sensors attached at 1 \n\nand 3 m a.b., and a PPS4/3 sediment trap with its 0.05 m2 opening positioned at 4 m a.b \n\n(Figure 3.4d, e). \n\nInstruments were set to measure at 5- or 15-minute intervals. The ADCP collected \n\ncurrent velocity and acoustic backscatter data in 5-cm vertical intervals. The data \n\npresented here always refer to a level at 100-cm interval above the bottom. \n\nThirteen deployments were made, 5 in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, 7 in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon and 1 on the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau ranging in depth between 343 and \n\n4975 m and with recording periods of 2 days up to 12 months (Figure 3.2 and Appendix \n\nTable A1.2). Sediment trap sample length was between 1 and 30 days. Before \n\ndeployment, sediment trap sample bottles (Figure 3.4f) were filled with filtered seawater \n\npoisoned with mercury (II) chloride (1 mg cm-3) and buffered with borax (2 mg cm-3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

These devices \n\nhave been in use for several decades and have provided valuable insight into the rates, \n\ntiming and mechanisms of material and energy transfer in the oceans (Asper, 1996 and \n\nreferences therein). However, the observation that in sub-aquatic environments, \n\nhorizontal current speeds often exceed the settling velocities of suspended particles by \n\nseveral orders of magnitude has raised awareness to the impact that water flow relative \n\nto a sediment trap can cause on trapping efficiency (for reviews see Knauer &amp; Asper, \n\n1989; Gardner, 1995). \n\nLaboratory and field experiments conducted by Gardner (1980a, b) demonstrated \n\nthat above a certain critical flow speed, which depends mainly on trap geometry, the trap \n\nwill underestimate the downward flux. In Gardner\u2019s calibration experiments, cylindrical \n\ntraps proved to give the most reliable estimate of downward fluxes. Further, the most \n\nimportant factor controlling the trapping efficiency of cylindrical traps is the \n\nheight/diameter ratio (aspect ratio). Under laboratory conditions cylinders with aspect \n\nratio between 2 and 3 appeared to yield accurate measurements of vertical fluxes in flows \n\nup to 15 cm s-1 (Gardner, 1980b). In the field, Baker et al. (1988), using cylindro-conical \n\ntraps, found that the magnitude and compositional characteristics of the flux collected \n\nunder flow speeds &lt;12 cm s-1 were indistinguishable from those simultaneously recorded \n\nby drifting traps, used as a reference not biased by water flow. In other field experiments, \n\nGardner et al. (1997) found that collecting efficiencies of cylinders of aspect ratio 3 were  \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 54 \n\nFigure 3.4.

Taking into account that the traps \n\nused in this study have a higher aspect ratio (4) than those tested by Gardner et al. \n\n(1997), the critical current speed may be higher in our case. \n\nFigure 3.5 illustrates the positive correlation between turbidity measured through \n\nacoustic backscatter and mass fluxes measured with a PPS4/3 sediment trap.

Sample preparation in the laboratory \n\n \n\nGrab samples  \n\nEach shelf sample was homogenised and split in two samples for different analyses: \n\n1) mineralogical and grain size analyses and 2) elemental analysis. The first set of \n\nsamples was treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 5 %) to remove organic material.  \n\nH2O2 was added stepwise until no more reaction occurred. Subsequently, samples were \n\nrinsed several times with distilled water to make sure that all the organic matter was \n\nremoved. These organic-matter-free samples and the second set of untreated samples \n\nwere then wet-sieved through a 63 \u00b5m sieve in order to normalise all sediments collected \n\non the continental shelf to the same grain size fraction. \n\n \n\nTrap samples \n\nAfter recovery of the lander, the sediment trap samples were sieved over a 1 mm \n\nsieve to remove swimmers (Figure 3.6a, b), and the &lt;1 mm fraction was subsequently \n\nsplit into sub-samples with either a Folsom or NOAA-type high precision splitter (Figure \n\n3.6c). Particulate matter was extracted by centrifugation at 3500 rpm or filtration on 0.4 \n\n\u00b5m polycarbonate filters, and then freeze-dried. Compositional analyses were performed \n\non bulk samples, but particle size was determined in samples from which the > 150 \u00b5m \n\nfraction had been removed by wet-sieving. \n\n \n\nCore samples \n\nIn the laboratory sediment cores were split, photographed and macroscopically \n\ninvestigated for lithological composition and presence of sedimentary or biogenic \n\nstructures.

Determination of grain size spectra \n\nGrain size spectra of fine sediments from the continental shelf/upper slope (Chapters \n\n4 and 5) and sediment trap samples and surface sediments from submarine canyons and \n\nopen slopes (Chapters 6 and 7) were determined with a laser forward-scattering particle \n\nsizer. The analyses of the first were carried at the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico with a MALVERN \n\nMicroP 2000 while the second were done at the Royal NIOZ with a Coulter LS230. The \n\nsediment was mechanically dispersed by ultrasonication without use of a chemical \n\ndispergent. Grain size spectra are presented as volume % in logarithmic size classes, and \n\nvolume is calculated from particle diameter assuming spherical particles. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Total organic carbon and CaCO3 \n\nFreeze-dried, homogenised core and sediment trap samples were analysed for total \n\ncarbon (Ctot), total organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen on a Carlo-Erba 1500 elemental \n\nanalyser following the procedure of Verardo et al. (1990) and modified after Lohse et al. \n\n(1998, 2000). For Corg determination, carbonates (predominantly CaCO3) were removed \n\nby progressive and controlled acidification with sulphurous acid. Content of organic \n\nmaterial in bulk sediment was calculated by multiplying Corg with 2.5. CaCO3 content was \n\ncalculated from Ctot and Corg as: \n\n)\n12\n\n100\n()((%)3 \u00d7?= orgtot CCCaCO                  (1) \n\nCorg/N ratio was also calculated and used as indicator of marine/terrestrial origin of \n\norganic matter. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Multi-elemental and 210Pb analysis \n\n \n\nMulti-elemental analysis with ICP-MS: shelf surface sediments \n\nHundred and six shelf sediment samples were analysed through ICP-MS for total \n\nconcentration of Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, Ti, Mn, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, Cu, As, Th and U. The analysis was \n\ndone in an international accredited laboratory \u2013 ACME Analytical Laboratories Ltd \u2013 ISO-\n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 60 \n\n9002 Accredited Co. According to routine procedure of the laboratory, 0.25 g of sample \n\nwas heated in HNO3-HF-HClO4 to fuming and then evaporated to dryness. The residue \n\nwas dissolved in HCl. The diluted samples were analysed using an ICP-MS. All samples \n\nwere analysed in a single run to reduce instrumental drift-effects. Several samples were \n\nrepeated in the beginning and at the end of the run to assess the amount of drift. \n\nAccuracy and precision were assessed through analysis of 8 repeats of reference \n\nmaterial DST6 done voluntary by the laboratory. Unidentified repeats (10 % of the total \n\nnumber of samples, according to recommendations of Darnley et al., 1995) and two \n\nsamples of reference material GBW 07309A (China Centre for certified Ref. Mat.) were \n\nalso included among our samples. \n\nAccuracy calculated from the reference material DST6 was between 90 and 110 % \n\nfor most elements, except for Zn which seems to have been underestimated (88 %). \n\nAccuracy calculated from the standard reference material GBW 07309A indicated \n\nunderestimation of Cr (67 %), U (87 %) and Ti (82 %). However, only 2 samples were \n\nconsidered to calculate the latter accuracy while the former was calculated on the basis of \n\n8 samples. \n\nPrecision was assessed through relative standard deviation (RSD) and based on \n\nreplicate analyses made voluntarily by the laboratory and 12 replicate samples included in \n\nour set of samples. According to Huber (1998) in Ribani et al. (2004) values of RSD &lt;\n\n5 % and &lt;20 % are acceptable for major and minor elements, respectively. RSD values \n\ncalculated through the laboratory\u2019s replicate analyses were under the above percentages \n\nfor all elements except Ti, which had a precision of 9 %. RSD values calculated using the \n\n12 included replicate samples give also percentages below the above limits for all \n\nelements except again Ti with the same accuracy of 9 %. \n\n \n\nMulti-elemental analysis with ICP-MS: canyon and open slope sediments \n\nThe following sample preparation and analysis for the determination of multi-\n\nelemental concentration, Pb stable isotope ratios (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) and activity of \n210Pb took place at the Royal NIOZ and were carried out under clean-room conditions \n\n(class 100 laminar flow hood, clean laboratory class 100). All labware was acid-cleaned \n\nusing a Milestone traceClean\u00ae device and stored in plastic bags. \n\nA combined method was used to for the preparation of sediment samples for multi-\n\nelemental, Pb stable isotope ratios and 210Pb analysis. First, 1 ml of 209Po spike solution \n\n(79.8 mBq g-1 in 1 M ultra-grade HNO3) was added to a teflon bomb. Subsequently, about \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 61\n\n10 mg of freeze-dried and ground sample was added to the bomb, and digested in a \n\nmicrowave in a mix of 1 ml Milli-Q-Element (Millipore) high purity water (18.2 M?), 6 ml \n\nconcentrated ultrapure HNO3 and 0.2 ml concentrated HF (suprapur). Subsequently, 1 ml \n\nconcentrated ultrapure HClO4 was added as an additional digestion step and to ensure \n\neffective removal of HF during evaporation. The sample solution was evaporated to \n\ndryness, after which the residue was dissolved again with concentrated ultrapure HNO3 \n\nand diluted with 18.2 M? Milli-Q to 1M HNO3. Finally, scandium, thallium and indium \n\n(Merck, Certipur, stock solution 1000 mg L-1) were added as internal standards. Elemental \n\nconcentrations (Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, Cu and U) and stable isotope ratios \n\nwere obtained in separate analytical runs using an Element-2 high resolution double \n\nfocusing ICP-MS (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a teflon microflow \n\nnebulizer and a double spray chamber to obtain a stable signal. All analyses were \n\nperformed in duplicate. For more information on the determination of the Pb stable \n\nisotope ratios consult Richter et al. (2009). \n\nThe accuracy of the overall procedure (digestion and analysis) was assessed by \n\nanalysing standard reference material GBW 07309A within every batch of 10 samples. The \n\nnumber of batches was 30 (n = 30). The accuracy for most of the analysed elements was \n\n90 \u2013 110 %. Only Al had an accuracy of 85 % and Zn showed an accuracy of 113 %. \n\nMajor elements (Fe, Ca, Mg) had precisions &lt;10 %, except Al with a precision of 12 % \n\nand trace metals &lt;20 %. Procedural blanks for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca and Mn generally yielded \n\nintensities corresponding to less than 1 % of the signal in sediment samples. Intensities \n\nfor Pb and U were &lt;3 %; for Cr &lt;10 % and &lt;15 % for Ni, Zn and Cu. \n\n \n210Pb analysis with alpha spectrometry \n\nFor 210Pb analysis, the sediment solution with 209Po internal standard, prepared as \n\ndescribed above, was again evaporated to dryness to remove HNO3. Subsequently, the \n\ndry residue was dissolved in 5 ml of concentrated HCl (12 M) and the solution was \n\nheated, after which 50 ml of diluted HCl (0.5 M) and 5 ml of ascorbic acid (20 g / 500 ml) \n\nwere added. Silver plates were then suspended in the teflon bombs with solution during \n\n16 h at 70 \u00baC, to collect Po via spontaneous deposition. The activity of 210Pb was \n\nmeasured in these plates indirectly via its granddaughter 210Po, with a half-life of 138.4 \n\ndays, via ?-spectrometry with Canberra Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) \n\ndetectors. \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 62 \n\n Sample preparation and analysis took place at the Royal NIOZ and were carried \n\nout under clean-room conditions (class 100 laminar flow hood, clean laboratory class \n\n100). All labware was acid-cleaned using a Milestone traceClean\u00ae device and stored in \n\nplastic bags. \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Mineralogy of the fine and clay fractions \n\nIrradiation of crystalline mineral groups with X-ray produces specific patterns of X-\n\nRay diffraction (XRD) on the crystal structural planes from which minerals can be \n\nidentified, even in a mixture of minerals (Gomes, 1988). For the present study a total of \n\n274 surface and trap samples were analysed for bulk mineralogical content and 232 \n\nsamples for clay mineralogical contents, by means of XRD analysis. The majority of \n\nanalyses were carried out at the Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro, and \n\na smaller number at the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico in Lisbon. In both laboratories analyses \n\nwere carried out using a Philips PANalytical diffractometer, with CuK? radiation, following \n\nthe same analytical procedure. The main mineral phases present in the samples were \n\nidentified using the database from Brindley &amp; Brown (1980) and MacDiff software\u2019s \n\ndatabase (Petschick, 2000) (see Figure 3.8 and 3.9). An attempt to quantify relative \n\nabundance of minerals was also done, on the basis of the percentage approach, which \n\nmeans that the sum of all identified phases in a sample is taken as 100 %. Since this is a \n\nrelative quantification the term semi-quantification is used in the presented estimates. For \n\nsemi-quantitative analysis, the peak areas from basal reflections of minerals were \n\nestimated using MacDiff software (Petschick, 2000) and afterwards weighted by \n\nempirically estimated factors (Tables 3.1 and 3.2). \n\n \n\nFine fraction \n\nThe term \u201crandomly oriented specimen\u201d will be used to refer to the analysis of bulk \n\nsoftly grounded sediment (&lt;63 \u00b5m). In this case, sample was not compressed within the \n\nXRD sample container in order to avoid preferential orientation of crystals with different \n\nhabits, and thus to obtain a more realistic semi-quantification (Gomes, 1988). For \n\nrandomly oriented specimens, scans were run between 0\u00ba and 60\u00ba 2? as shown in Figure \n\n3.8 and the main groups of minerals identified and the respective peak used for \n\nquantification are indicated in Table 3.1. \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 63\n\n \n\nClay fraction \n\nAfter analysing the fine-fraction mineralogy, the clay fraction was separated by \n\nsedimentation in a settling column filled with distillated water according to Stoke's law, \n\nusing 1 % sodium hexametaphosphate solution to avoid flocculation (e.g. Rocha, 1993). \n\nIn order to identify minerals in the clay fraction, XRD analysis is most commonly \n\ndone on oriented specimens, since this type of preparation enhances the signals \n\noriginating from the 001 cleavage plane. However, the bias caused by preferential \n\norientation of crystals with different habits is not important here since most of the \n\nminerals present in this fraction are layered silicates. This procedure facilitates recognition \n\nof individual clay mineral phases (Kahle et al., 2002) and increases the sensitivity of the \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

After that, three successive \n\nXRD scans were performed on the sample: a first scan on the original air dried sample, a \n\nsecond scan after saturating the sample with glycerol, and a third scan after heating the \n\nglycerol-saturated sample to 500 \u00b0C for 90 minutes. Differences between successive scans \n\nare illustrated in Figure 3.9a, b, c. The scans were run between 2\u00ba and 20\u00ba 2? for the air \n\ndried aggregates and between 2\u00ba and 15\u00ba 2? for the other two treatments.  \n\nThe clay mineral analysis allowed distinction of four clay mineral groups with \n\nrelatively broad peaks: illite, kaolinite, smectite and chlorite.

Materials and methods \n\n 68 \n\n3.3. Data processing and calculations \n\n3.3.1. Horizontal sediment fluxes in the bottom boundary layer \n\nAcoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) are capable of yielding suspended \n\nsediment concentrations (SSC) estimates over the depth range ensonified at a high \n\ntemporal and spatial resolution. ADCPs are non-intrusive, as the sediment suspension is \n\nbeing monitored at distance. The disadvantage of the acoustic approach is the \n\ndependence on sediment properties. In particular, irregularities in grain size distribution \n\nrestrict the accuracy of acoustic SSC measurements (Mol, 2003). The ADCP used in the \n\npresented study collected data in 5-cm vertical intervals; the data presented here always \n\nrefer to a level at 100-cm above the seabed. For the conversion of acoustic data into SSC \n\nestimates, the first step was to convert CTD profiles of optical backscatter to SSC, using \n\nfiltered suspended matter samples for calibration. Then, optical backscatter values \n\nobtained by the BOBO lander were calibrated to SSC estimates from nearby CTD casts. \n\nFinally, the optical backscatter record of the BOBO lander, converted to SCC, was used for \n\ncalibration of the acoustic backscatter. An exponential relationship was found between \n\noptical and acoustic backscatter from the BOBO lander. Since the influence of variations in \n\nparticle characteristics during the measurement on optical and acoustic quantification of \n\nSSC is not known, the calculated sediment flux has to be regarded as a rough order of \n\nmagnitude approximation. \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Accumulation rates determined in sediment cores \n\nThe analysis of down-core 210Pb activity is an important dating tool on a 100-yr time \n\nscale, providing a method for calculating recent sediment accumulation rates (SARs) in \n\nenvironments where a relatively undisturbed sediment record is preserved. In areas of \n\nlow SARs and relatively intense bioturbation, the method is considered less suitable for \n\ndating, because it is often not possible to accurately correct for reworking (Carpenter et \n\nal., 1982). \n\nIn the description of down-core profiles of 210Pb activity three characteristic vertical \n\nzones are generally observed (e.g. Nittrouer et al., 1979):  \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 69\n\ni) a surface mixed layer (SML), extending to a distance L below the water sediment \n\ninterface, where sediments are actively mixed by physical and biological \n\nprocesses;  \n\nii) a region where 210Pb activities decrease logarithmically with depth in the \n\nsediment;  \n\niii) a lower region of background activity, in equilibrium with 226Ra. \n\nFor the present study sediment accumulation rates (SAR) were determined using the \n\nmodel of Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation Rate (CF/CS; Appleby &amp; Oldfield, \n\n1992 in Boer et al., 2006) and the model of Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation \n\nRate including a surface mixed layer (SML) on the top (CF/CSSML; Carpenter et al., 1982; \n\nBoer et al., 2006). \n\nThe first is a one-layered profile consisting of an exponential downward decline in \n\nexcess (or unsupported) 210Pb activity, on top of a background 210Pb (supported 210Pb) \n\nproduced by decay of 222Rn in the sediment. A Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation \n\nrate (CF/CS) model is usually applied for dating, which assumes that the SAR remained \n\nconstant and that reworking of sediment has been negligible (Appleby &amp; Oldfield, 1992). \n\nThe down-core total 210Pb activity (A) can be described with the equation: \n\n \n\n(sup))(0)( exp AAA\nm\n\nxstotm +=\n?\n?\n?\n\n                  (2) \n\n \n\nWhere: Am is the total \n210Pb activity (mBq g?1 dry sediment) at the cumulative mass \n\ndepth m (g cm?2), A0(xs) is the initial excess \n210Pb activity at the sediment-water interface \n\n(mBq g?1 dry sediment), ? is the decay constant of 210Pb (0.0311 yr?1), ? is the SAR (g \n\ncm?2 yr?1) and A(sup) is the supported \n210Pb activity (mBq g?1). \n\nThe CF/CSSML model is a two-layered profile consisting of an upper layer with a slow \n\nexponential downward decline in excess 210Pb activity and a deeper layer characterised by \n\na more rapid exponential downward decline. For these profiles, the usual assumption is \n\nthat diffuse mixing caused by burrowing organisms generates a surface mixed layer \n\n(SML). The strength of the mixing processes in the SML is measured by the mixing \n\ncoefficient (Db) in units of g\n2 cm-4 y-1, assumed constant mixing rate throughout the mixed \n\nlayer. This coefficient is incorporated into the equation for the SML: \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods \n\n 70 \n\n(sup))(0)( exp AAA\nm\n\nxstotm +=\n?

It is \n\nassumed that no reworking takes place below the SML, and that the SAR is constant \n\nthrough both layers (?(SML)= ?(layer2)). The SAR is calculated from the layer below the SML. \n\nLinear sedimentation rates are a function of porosity and SAR. As a result of \n\nsediment compaction, linear sedimentation rate decreases with depth in cores. To \n\ncircumvent this problem of differential compaction, 210Pb activity profiles were plotted \n\nagainst cumulative mass depth by intergrading dry bulk density values over depth (Figure \n\n3.11).

Baselines were determined \n\nseparately for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 canyons (Table 7.1). These EFs compare \n\npresent-day normalised trace metal contents with pre-industrial normalised contents of \n\n150 years ago (cf. section 3.1.2).  \n\nAs shown in Equation (5), Fe was used as the normaliser. Among various proxies for \n\npotential trace metal carriers, such as Al and Fe for terrigenous aluminosilicates, Ca and \n\nCaCO3 for pelagic skeletal carbonate, and Corg for organic matter, Fe and Al showed the \n\nlargest number of significant positive correlations with trace metals. However, as Fe had \n\nthe highest accuracy and the strongest correlations to trace metals Fe was chosen for the \n\nnormalisation of trace metals. No indication in the data was found referring secondary \n\ndiagenetic enrichment of trace metals played a significant role. The selection of the \n\nnormaliser is thoroughly discussed in Chapter 7, section 7.2.4. on pg. 195. \n\nAn EF value varying between 0.5 and 1.5 was interpreted to indicate a predominantly \n\nnatural origin for the element in the sediment, while values greater than 1.5 indicate \n\nenrichment by either natural processes (e.g. contributions from biota) or anthropogenic \n\ninfluences. EF values lower than 0.5 can reflect mobilisation and loss of these elements \n\nrelative to the conservative element, or could indicate an overestimation of the baseline \n\nmetal contents (e.g. Zhang, 1995; Mil-Homens et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

Introduction \n\n4.1.1. Different types of sediments and the importance of their study \n\nThe oceans of the world represent a natural depository for the dissolved and \n\nparticulate products of continental weathering. After being discharged into the ocean by \n\nrivers, part of the dissolved load precipitates by biological and geochemical processes and \n\nis deposited on the ocean floor along with detritic sedimentary material. \n\nOcean sediments are heterogeneous with regard to their composition, displaying a \n\nconsiderable degree of geographical variation. Due to the origin and formation of the \n\ncomponents various sediment types can be distinguished: lithogenic sediments which are \n\ntransported and dispersed into the ocean as detrital particles, either as terrigenous \n\nparticles (derived from land, which is most frequently the case) or as particles nourished \n\nby immersed outcrops (having only local importance); biogenic sediments which are \n\ndirectly constructed by organisms or are formed by accumulation of loose skeletal \n\nfragments; authigenic sediments which precipitate directly out of solution as new \n\nformations, or are a result of changes occurred when the pre-existing particles come into \n\ncontact with the solution (F\u00fctterer, 2006). \n\nLithogenic sediments on continental shelves reflect prevailing climatic conditions that \n\naffect chemical and physical weathering and transport processes, the geology of the \n\nsource areas, and oceanographic processes. Coarse sediments (gravel and sands) are \n\ncarried as bedload over the seabed and are deposited close to the mainland while finer \n\nparticles (silt and clay) are transported in suspension and are therefore dispersed over \n\nlarge distances by currents. Part of the suspended matter transported over the shelf may \n\nsettle and form ephemeral or more permanent fine-grained deposits on the shelf \n\n(Abrantes, 2005). \n\nMinerals like plagioclases are good indicators of \u201cfresh\u201d lithogenic sediment because \n\nthey are less resistant than most other common rock-forming minerals to weathering \n\nprocesses (Meunier, 2005), especially in the marine environment (Rothwell, 1989). Table \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 76 \n\n4.1 shows the total dissolution time of silica in minerals according to Lasaga (1984). \n\nAlthough this study does not refer to the marine environment it clearly illustrates the wide \n\nrange of dissolution rates of various common minerals. \n\nThe provenance of sediments from different source areas with different lithologies \n\nmay be distinguished through the assemblage of minerals present in the fine fraction. \n\nEspecially minerals in the clay-size range are susceptible to erosion and dispersal by \n\nfluvial and aeolic transport, and transport by seabed currents and gravitational \n\nmovements (Ehrmann et al., 1992). Generally, clay minerals are not very susceptible to \n\nimportant mineralogical and chemical transformations during transport and after \n\ndeposition in the marine environment. However, if the transport is over a long distance or \n\nif the minerals spend enough time in the marine environment, subtle changes do occur \n\n(referred to as \u201ccrystallographic scarring\u201d by Millot, 1964 and Segonzac, 1969). An \n\nexample is the increase of illite \n\ncrystallinity order with increasing \n\nexposure to the marine environment, \n\nresulting from incorporation of Al into \n\nthe crystal structure (Nemecz, 1981; \n\nMillot, 1964; Oliveira et al., 2002).  \n\nBased on these general \n\nobservations, the distribution of fine-\n\ngrained material in marine sediments \n\nand of clay mineral associations which \n\ncharacterise these fine fractions have \n\nbeen widely used in studies of recent \n\nsedimentary dynamics, as indicators for \n\nprovenance, dispersal and deposition of fine-grained sediments (e.g. Karlin, 1980; Honjo \n\net al., 1982; Z\u00f6llmer &amp; Irion, 1993; Berner &amp; Wefer, 1994; Oliveira et al., 2002; Kairyte et \n\nal., 2005; Morais et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007). \n\nStudies of the biogenic component in the fine fraction of marine sediments have \n\nshown the potential use of calcareous nannoplankton and diatoms as tracers of specific \n\nwater masses and as paleoenvironmental tracers (e.g. Findlay &amp; Flores, 2000; Salgueiro \n\net al., 2008; Cochran &amp; Neil, 2010). \n\nTable 4.1.

Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 77\n\n4.1.2. Different types of sedimentary deposits on the shelf \n\nApproximately 70 % of the continental shelf surface worldwide is covered with relict \n\nsediment, i.e. sediment deposited during the last glacial period under conditions different \n\nfrom today\u2019s, especially at times when the sea level was comparatively low (Emery, \n\n1968). The fine-grained constituents of shelf sediments were eluted during the rise of the \n\nsea level in the Holocene and exported over the edge of the shelf to the adjacent \n\ncontinental slope. The remaining sediment, covering large areas of modern shelf seabed, \n\nconsists of relatively coarse sandy material (Milliman et al. 1972; Milliman &amp; Summerhays, \n\n1975). It is therefore assumed that fine-grained sediments contained in present shelf \n\ndeposits are of relatively recent age. \n\nSimilar to most other continental shelves worldwide (e.g. Emery, 1968), the central \n\nPortuguese shelf is characterised by the presence of various types of sedimentary \n\ndeposits, which reflect the interplay of different processes (e.g. long-term variations in \n\nsea level, sediment discharge from rivers, reworking of sediments by tides and currents, \n\nsheltering from main swell by capes). The fine fraction was chosen to be studied as it is \n\nthe sediment fraction which is common to all shelf deposits. In addition, it is the \n\nprevailing fraction in sediments of deeper areas like the adjacent submarine canyons and \n\nopen slopes, which are subject of Part III of this thesis. \n\n4.1.3. Objectives of Chapter 4 \n\nThe main objectives of this chapter are:  \n\n1) to describe the bulk and clay mineralogy of the fine fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m) from surface \n\nsediments collected in the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves and upper slopes; \n\n2) to compare results from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf with those from other areas \n\nof the Portuguese shelf with a different regional setting; \n\n3) to identify the main sources of fine-grained sediments in the study area, and gain \n\ninsight in prevailing dispersal processes acting on the shelf. \n\n      \n\n4.2. General composition of surface sediments \n\n Surface sediments from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf are dominated by sand-sized \n\nmaterial. Below 80 m WD (~outer shelf), fine-grained sediments are considerably more \n\nabundant on the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves compared to other areas of the Portuguese \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 78 \n\nshelf. Gravel occurs in low percentages in this area, contrasting with the adjacent \n\nEstremadura shelf. According to Dias (1987) the percentage of mica in surface sediments \n\nof the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves is relatively high not only for the Portuguese shelf but \n\nalso comparing to other shelves around the world. Most of the shelf sediment has bulk \n\ncarbonate contents below 30 % and sediments with higher contents of carbonates \n\ncorrespond to sandy deposits of the middle part of the Sines and Set\u00fabal shelves and of \n\nthe outer shelf / upper slope more in general (Figure 2.4). \n\n \n\n4.3. Grain size in the fine fraction of surface sediments \n\nThe mean grain size of the fine fraction of surface sediments of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-\n\nSines continental shelf shows no obvious geographic trend in distribution. Relatively \n\nhigher values occur in different parts of the study area such as the upper reaches of the \n\nCascais, Lisbon and Set\u00fabal Canyon, off the Sado Estuary and also in the southernmost \n\npart of the study area close to Cape Sines. The mean grain size values seem therefore to \n\nhave no relationship with water depth or to the type of sedimentary deposits. Mean grain \n\nsize values range from 6.1 to 7.4 \u00b5m on the Lisbon shelf and between 4.9 and 7.7 \u00b5m \n\nand 5.0 and 9.8 \u00b5m on the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, respectively. Modal grain sizes \n\nspan a narrow range of values on the Lisbon shelf (6.5 \u2013 7.8 \u00b5m) compared to the \n\nSet\u00fabal and Sines shelves (4.6 \u2013 11.0 \u00b5m and 4.6 \u2013 31.2 \u00b5m, respectively). These modal \n\ngrain sizes do not show a relationship with water depth (data not shown). \n\nOn the other hand, contents of clay-sized particles show clear spatial distribution \n\npatterns (Figure 4.1). Relatively low contents of clay-sized particles (17 to 23 %) are \n\nfound on the Lisbon shelf. In accordance, contents of silt are higher on the Lisbon shelf \n\ncompared to those from the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves. However, a more reliable \n\ncomparison between different shelf areas is made when sediments from similar \n\nsedimentary deposits are compared. Figure 4.2a compares the grain size spectra of the \n\nfine fraction of surface sediments from the Tagus and Sado mud patches (fine fraction > \n\n90 %). Sediments from the Sado mud patch appear slightly finer-grained than those of \n\nthe Tagus mud patch, with fine fraction modes of, respectively, 8 \u2013 9 \u00b5m and 9 \u2013 11 \u00b5m \n\n(Figure 4.2a). \n\n  \n\n\n\n4.

Content of clay-sized particles in the fine fraction of surface sediments from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-\nSines shelf and upper slope. \n\n \n\nThe relative proportions of clay and silt in the fine fraction shows considerable spatial \n\nvariation in the area. Paradoxically, the higher percentages of clay-sized material are \n\nfound in deposits with overall low content of fine sediment (&lt;63 \u00b5m), whereas low \n\npercentages of clay-size material occur in deposits rich in fine-grained material (Figures \n\n4.1 and 4.2b). The reasons for this inverse relationship will be discussed in section 4.6.3. \n\n \n\n4.4. Fine-fraction bulk mineralogy \n\nLithogenic detrital components of marine sediments, despite all regional variability, \n\nare composed of only a few common minerals. Next to quartz, which remains largely \n\nunaltered, even after prolonged weathering, phyllosilicates (most of them clay minerals) \n\nrepresent the most common end product of complete weathering of metamorphic and \n\nigneous rock. Consequently, this group represents the most important mineral constituent \n\nin sediments, next to quartz and biogenic minerals. To a lesser degree, terrigenous \n\ndetritus contains unweathered minerals like feldspars. In general, the biogenic minerals \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 80 \n\ncontributing most to sediment formation are carbonate minerals in the form of calcite, \n\nMg-calcite and aragonite, and biogenic opal in the form of amorphous SiO2\u00b7nH2O. \n\nConsequently, the bulk mineralogy of fine fraction shelf surface sediments of the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf is qualitatively monotonous. Although varying in relative \n\nabundance, only seven different minerals / groups of minerals were identified (Table 4.2): \n\nQuartz (Qz), Calcite (Cc), Phyllosilicates (Phy), Plagioclases (Plg), K-Feldspars (K-F), \n\nAragonite (Arg) and Mg-Calcite (Mg-Cc). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.1. Quartz \n\nQuartz constitutes between 12 and 51 % of the fine sediment fraction of the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal-Sines shelf (Figure 4.3). On the Lisbon shelf, the highest contents are found at \n\nshallower water depths, and the lowest contents at the shelfbreak and in the upper \n\nreaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. On the Set\u00fabal shelf the highest contents of \n\nquartz appear in the northwestern part, almost in connection with areas of high quartz \n\ncontents on the Lisbon shelf, and also in sandy deposits off the Sado Estuary. On the \n\nSines shelf quartz contents are highest in sandy deposits of the inner shelf (&lt;50 m WD). \n\nFigure 4.11a shows the statistical distribution (median, percentiles 25 and 75 and \n\nextremes) of fine fraction quartz content for different classes of fine sediment content \n\n(&lt;63 \u00b5m).

Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 81\n\nSedimentary deposits composed of more than 25 % of fine sediment fraction have the \n\nhighest contents of quartz in the fine fraction (Figure 4.11a). \n \n\nTable 4.2.

Phyllosilicates \n\nConcentrations of phyllosilicates between 26 and 32 % are found in the Tagus mud \n\npatch and even higher contents (> 40 %) are found in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 4.4). \n\nOn the Set\u00fabal shelf three areas show enrichments in phyllosilicates: sediments in the \n\noutlet of the Sado Estuary (59 %); the Sado mud patch (reaching 40 %) and the upper \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (reaching 39 %). On the Sines shelf, percentages of phyllosilicates tend \n\nto be lower than 20 % and only on the inner shelf off the central coastal arc contents are \n\nhigher than 25 % (Figure 4.4). \n\nIn general, phyllosilicates seem to accumulate in areas that are relatively sheltered \n\nfrom intense wave and current energy, like in submarine canyons, on mud patches off the \n\nTagus and Sado rivers and in estuaries. Since these are also the areas where fine-grained \n\nsediments tend to accumulate, phyllosilicate content in the fine fraction, and content of \n\nfine fraction in the total sediment appear positively correlated (Figure 4.11b). However, \n\nhigher percentages of phyllosilicates are also found in some sandy samples (FS &lt;10 %) \n\nlocated close to phyllosilicate sources (e.g. the outlet of the Sado Estuary and the inner \n\nshelf off the central coastal arc between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines). \n\nDespite this positive relationship between phyllosilicate content and the amount of \n\nfine fraction in shelf deposits, a negative correlation was found between the clay content \n\nand the amount of fine fraction in the total sediment (Figure 4.2b). These two \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 82 \n\nobservations seem not to be in accordance since clay minerals constitute a large portion \n\nof the family of phyllosilicates. However, a large portion does not mean all. Muscovites \n\nare phyllosilicates of which the size ranges from 0.4 to 100 \u00b5m and they represent an \n\nimportant mineral constituent of the samples here presented and can be identified even in \n\nthe bulk mineralogy (cf. Figure 3.8). Therefore, all muscovites contained in the fine \n\nfraction contribute to the phyllosilicates while only a part of these muscovites (those that \n\nhave a diameter less than 2 \u00b5m) are counted as clay fraction. Muscovites in the clay \n\nfraction are counted as illite since there is no way of differentiating both minerals through \n\nnormal XRD procedures. \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Feldspars \n\nPlagioclase in the fine fraction has a relatively well-defined spatial distribution \n\npattern. High concentrations occur on the Lisbon shelf, especially close to the outlet of \n\nthe Tagus Estuary, and extend to the northwest Set\u00fabal shelf (Figure 4.5). High contents \n\nof plagioclase also occur on the inner Sines shelf (15 \u2013 23 %). In general, the higher \n\nmean concentrations of plagioclase in the fine fraction are found in deposits with contents \n\nof fine fraction higher than 25 % (Figure 4.11c). \n\nIn the same way as plagioclase, contents of K-feldspar generally decrease with water \n\ndepth (Figure 4.6). The highest values occur in the sandy deposits of the inner shelf \n\nespecially at the shallowest depths. \n\n \n\n4.4.4.Carbonates \n\nIn general, contents of calcite are below 25 % on the Lisbon shelf, and above 25 % \n\nand up to 62 % on the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelf, except near the shore (Figure 4.7). There \n\nis no relationship between the content of this biogenic mineral and the amount of fine \n\nfraction in the sediment. The areas with higher terrigenous input near the outlets of the \n\nTagus and Sado estuaries are well highlighted by concentrations of calcite lower than \n\n25 % (see pink dots in Figure 4.7). \n\nAragonite occurs in significant amounts (> 3 %) on the inner and middle Set\u00fabal \n\nshelf, but it is less common on the Sines shelf, and virtually absent in the sampled area of \n\nthe Lisbon shelf (Figure 4.8). Across the Set\u00fabal and Sines inner shelves there is a \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 83\n\nsouthward decrease in aragonite content. Aragonite content is clearly inversely related to \n\nthe amount of fine fraction (Figure 4.11f). \n\nSignificant contents of Mg-calcite (> 5 %) only occur on the inner and middle \n\nshelves. The distribution is rather scattered on the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, without \n\nclear geographical pattern. As for aragonite, Mg-calcite occurs mainly in sandy deposits \n\n(Figure 4.9). \n\nThe lithogenic against biogenic mineral (L/C) ratio (Phy+Qz+Felds/CC+Mg-Cc+Arg) \n\nhighlights the areas most affected by fresh lithogenic sediment input. The whole Lisbon \n\nshelf in general shows high values for this ratio (> 3). On the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, \n\nhigh values (> 3) occur in the Sado mud patch, in the Sado outlet and on the inner shelf \n\nbordering the central and southern part of the coastal arc between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines \n\n(Figure 4.10). \n\n \n\n4.4.5. Comparison to the adjacent open slope and canyon environments \n\nThe bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments from the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal-Sines outer shelf and upper slope (100\u2013500 m WD) is quite variable, displaying \n\nstrong along-shelf gradients. Lithogenic/carbonate ratios are comparable on the Sines \n\nouter shelf (100 - 200 m WD) and upper slope (200 \u2013 500 m WD) (Figure 4.10), with \n\nratio ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 and from 0.5 to 1.5, respectively. As shown in Chapter 6, the \n\nsurface sediment layer (0 - 0.5 cm) of two multicores collected from the Sines upper slope \n\n(280 and 490 m) had comparable L/C ratios (0.9 and 1.1) to those in grab samples from \n\nthe Sines upper slope. \n\nFurther down the Sines open slope, in depths > 1000 m, the L/C ratio increases to \n\nvalues between 1.2 and 1.5 as a result of an increase of phyllosilicates and slight \n\ndecrease of calcite relative to upper slope sediments (compare Figure 4.4 and 4.7 with \n\nFigure 6.10). Surface sediments from the lower Set\u00fabal Canyon (> 2000 m WD) show \n\neven higher L/C ratios between 1.7 and 2.0 (Figure 6.12a), similar to values found for \n\nsurface sediments from the Lisbon shelf and certain parts of the Set\u00fabal shelf (Figure \n\n4.10). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 89\n\n4.5. Clay-fraction mineralogy \n\nClay minerals are of special importance, not only because they constitute the largest \n\nportion of fine-grained and non-biogenous sediment, but also because they have the \n\nspecial geochemical property of absorbing and easily giving off ions, a property which will \n\nbe further discussed in Chapter 5. Clay minerals are mostly formed by the weathering of \n\nprimary, rock forming aluminous silicates, like feldspar, hornblende and pyroxene, or \n\nvolcanic glass. Kaolinite, chlorite, illite, and smectite, representing the four most important \n\ngroups of clay minerals, are typically formed under very different conditions of \n\nweathering. Consequently, the analysis of their qualitative and quantitative distribution \n\nmay allow to make inferences on origin and transport, weathering and hydrolysis, and \n\ntherefore on climate conditions of the source region of the clay minerals (Biscaye, 1965; \n\nChamley, 1989). \n\nThe mineralogy of the clay fraction of shelf sediments is qualitatively monotonous. \n\nOnly four different groups of minerals were identified yet, their percentages can vary \n\nsignificantly (Table 4.3): illite (54 \u2013 80 %), kaolinite (18 \u2013 40 %), smectite (1 \u2013 12 %) \n\nand chlorite (0 \u2013 3 %). \n \n\nTable 4.3.

Illite \n\nIllite is the most abundant clay mineral in ocean sediments. As a typical terrigenous \n\nmineral, it occurs in distinctly higher concentration in sediments at mid-latitudes of the \n\nnorthern oceans, which are surrounded by great land masses. \n\nContents of illite in the study area show a southward increase and also some \n\nenrichment with increasing water depth. Both Tagus and Sado mud patches have \n\ncontents between 61 and 69 % while values over 72 % occur almost exclusively on the \n\nSines shelf (Figure 4.12). Excluding deposits with less than 10 % of fine sediments, it \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 90 \n\nseems that contents of illite are inversely related to the amount of fine fraction present in \n\nshelf deposits (Figure 4.13a). As such, the distribution of illite seems the opposite of that \n\nof kaolinite, which tends to have higher contents in fine-grained deposits fed by river \n\ninput. \n\nIn the study area the Esquevin Index (EI) varies between 0.24 (Fe-rich illites) and 0.67 \n\n(Al-rich illites). In shallow sandy deposits EI values are higher while in the predominantly fine-\n\ngrained deposits of the shelfbreak, the mud patches and the upper canyon reaches values \n\ntend to be lower, which means that Fe-rich illites predominate. \n\nThe Kubler Index (KI) shows higher values, representing lower crystallinity in deposits \n\nwith higher contents of fine fraction. The highest KI values (lower crystallinity) occur on the \n\nLisbon shelf where fine-grained sediments predominate (Figure 4.15). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.12.

Kaolinite \n\nThe distribution of kaolinite in marine sediments depends on the intensity of chemical \n\nweathering in its source region and the essential patterns of eolian and fluvial transport. \n\nDue to its concentration at equatorial and tropical latitudes, kaolinite is usually referred to \n\nas the \u201cclay mineral of low latitudes\u201d (Griffin et al., 1968). \n\nAs already mentioned above, the distribution of kaolinite shows opposite trends to \n\nthat of illite, decreasing in southward direction. The highest concentrations are associated \n\nto the outlets of the Tagus and Sado estuaries. Conspicuously high contents, reaching \n\n32 % are also found just offshore of the central part of the Tr\u00f3ia \u2013 Sines coastal arc \n\n(Figure 4.16). \n\nFor an easy description on the variation of the kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) the \n\nauthor divided the index values in 5 classes according to Figure 4.17. This classification is \n\nbased solely on the data from the present thesis. Kaolinite on the Lisbon shelf is mostly of \n\nrelatively \u201ccrystalline\u201d nature (low indexes). On the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelf areas the \n\ncrystallinity is more variable, with KCI values indicating the occurrence of both relatively \n\n\u201ccrystalline\u201d and \u201cvery degraded\u201d kaolinites. The latter are found mostly in shallower \n\nsandy deposits near the shore (Figure 4.13c).  \n\n \n\n4.5.3. Smectite \n\nSmectite is generally considered as an indicator of a \u201cvolcanic regime\u201d (Griffin et al. \n\n1968). High smectite concentrations are usually observed in regions of volcanic activity, \n\ndistant from major landmasses so that dilution with terrigenous sediment including other \n\nclay mineral is low. The low smectite concentration in the North Atlantic is due to \n\nterrigenous detritus inputs which are rich in illites and chlorites (F\u00fctterer, 2006). \n\nIn the study area smectite concentrations are higher on the Lisbon shelf and in the \n\nnorthern part of the Set\u00fabal shelf (Figure 4.18). The highest values (8 \u2013 12 %), however, \n\nare found just offshore the central part of the coastal arc between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines. \n\n \n\n4.5.4.Chlorite \n\nWorldwide the distribution of chlorite in deep-sea sediments is essentially inversely \n\nrelated to the pattern of kaolinite. Although chlorite is distributed relatively \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 94 \n\nhomogeneously over the oceans, its highest concentration is measured in the polar \n\nregions, and therefore chlorite is referred to as the \u201chigh latitude mineral\u201d (Griffin et al. \n\n1968). \n\nIn the study area the spatial distribution of chlorite is a bit scattered with no clear \n\ntrend (Figure 4.19). This may be related to its low abundance (0 \u2013 3 %), on which the \n\nerror associated to the XRD measurements (~1 %) has a relatively large effect. \n\nNonetheless, median contents of chlorite tend to decrease with increasing contents of fine \n\nfraction in shelf deposits (Figure 4.13g). \n\n \n\n4.5.5. Comparison to the adjacent open slope and canyon environments \n\nKaolinite is a good tracer for the dispersal of fine-grained sediment from the shelf to \n\nthe open slope and canyon environments, since its distribution clearly reflects lithogenic \n\nsediment input from land, and it is degraded with time in the marine environment. On the \n\nSines outer shelf/upper slope, percentages of kaolinite vary between 18 and 29 % (Figure \n\n4.16), comparable to contents found on the Sines open slope (490 - 3900 m WD) which \n\nvary between 21 and 27 %. In the middle and lower reaches of Set\u00fabal Canyon (> \n\n2000 m WD), surface sediments have kaolinite contents that span a narrower range of \n\nvalues (26 - 27 %). Although contents of kaolinite show little variation throughout the \n\nSines margin the kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) varies considerably. On the outer \n\nshelf/upper slope the KCI goes from 0.0039 to 0.0160 (from relatively crystalline to more \n\ndegraded kaolinites, respectively) with some tendency to decrease with increasing water \n\ndepth. On the adjacent open slope the crystallinity index reflects a similar variation \n\nbetween crystalline to degraded kaolinites (KCI 0.0038 \u2013 0.0180). Finally, kaolinite in \n\nsurface sediments from the lower Set\u00fabal Canyon has relatively high crystallinity (KCI \n\n0.0025-0.0045). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Discussion \n\n4.6.1. The clay mineralogy context of the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves \n\nExhaustive data on clay mineral distribution in the world ocean sediments were \n\nsuccessively provided by Biscaye (1965), Griffin et al. (1968) and Rateev et al. (1969). \n\nThese data, augmented with subsequent information published by different authors, were \n\nreviewed and discussed by Windom (1976), who proposed average percentage values for \n\nthe four major groups of clay minerals identified in surface deposits of the world main \n\nocean basins (Chamley, 1989). Such average values have so far not been published for \n\nthe bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m). \n\nThe relative proportions of the various clay minerals in marine sediments is a \n\nfunction of their original source, the climate conditions of the source region, their mode of \n\ntransport to the area of deposition \u2013 aeolian or volcanic transport, or transport by means \n\nof water currents or ice \u2013 and finally the route of transportation (Petschick et al., 1996). \n\nOn a global scale, the particular influence which, climate, weathering on the continents, \n\nwind patterns, riverine transport, and oceanic currents have on the distribution of \n\ndifferent clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, smectite, and chlorite) is relatively well-defined. \n\nThe assemblage of clay minerals and their proportions in the study area (Table 4.3) \n\nare in accordance with what Windom (1976) described as typical for the principal clay \n\nmineral groups in the &lt;2 \u00b5m fraction of seabed sediments for the North Atlantic: illite > \n\n50 %, kaolinite 10 - 20 %, smectite &lt;20 % and chlorite &lt;10 %. This assemblage of \n\nminerals reflects limited influence of hydrolytic processes, which are more important in \n\nlow-latitude humid climate areas, and the predominance of direct physical rock erosion \n\nunder colder climatic conditions. \n\nOn a regional scale, clay mineralogical variability is less obvious given the relatively \n\nsmall geographic area it comprises. When comparing between muddy deposits from \n\ndifferent parts of the western Iberian margin, some differences in clay mineral \n\nassemblages are still observed. The clay mineralogy of the Tagus and Sado mud patches \n\n(Figure 4.20) is different from that of the northern mud patches located on the shelf off \n\nPorto and Galicia (Figure 4.20). The Douro mud patch is located to the northwest of the \n\nmouth of the Douro River in water depths of 65\u2013130 m. It is about 8\u201318 km wide and \n\n42 km long, and its western boundary is delimited by rocky outcrops. The Galicia mud \n\npatch is situated further north off the Minho River at a water depth of 110\u2013120 m. It is a \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 98 \n\nnarrow north-south oriented strip of 50 km long and 2\u20133 km wide (Dias et al., 2002a). \n\nThe Douro mud patch consists mostly of silty material, whereas the Galicia mud patch is \n\nconstituted of finer grained silty-clayey material at its centre (Dias et al., 2002b and \n\nOliveira et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20. Descriptive statistics of the clay mineralogy from different mud patches on the west Iberian \nshelf: a) Galicia, Douro (Oliveira et al., 2002); b) Tagus and Sado mud patches. The location of samples \nstudied from these mud patches is shown. \n\n \n\nIn these northern deposits the contents of kaolinite and smectite are lower than \n\nthose found in the Tagus and Sado mud patches (Figure 4.20), whereas contents of illite \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 99\n\nand chlorite are higher than in the southern mud patches. A relative increase of illite and \n\nchlorite toward more northerly latitude is what would generally be expected according to \n\nWindom (1976), yet in this case the geology of the river basins draining to those areas is \n\nthe more likely reason for the differences between northern and southern mud patches. \n\nLow-grade metamorphic rocks (e.g. micaschists) and chloritic shales, and granite, \n\npotential sources of chlorite and illites, respectively, dominate the watersheds of the \n\nDouro, Minho and Vigo rivers (Ribeiro et al., 1979), whereas these lithologies are \n\nuncommon in both the Tagus and Sado basins (see Chapter 2). On the other hand, the \n\ngeology of the Tagus and Sado basins is characterised by abundant outcrops of Tertiary \n\nsedimentary rocks enriched in kaolinite and smectite (Pimentel, 1997). Although both \n\nkaolinite and smectite are commonly available in the watersheds of the Tagus and Sado \n\nrivers, the increase of kaolinite in deposits of the central Portuguese shelf is more evident \n\nthan that of smectite, probably because the latter remains longer in suspension whereas \n\nkaolinite settles more rapidly. This difference is due to the small size (&lt;1 ?m) of smectite \n\ncrystallites and to their ability to agglomerate into low-density aggregates (Meunier, \n\n2005). \n\n \n\n4.6.2. Bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments of the \n\ncentral Portuguese shelf \n\nIn order to study the mineralogical characteristics of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf in \n\na broader, regional context, data on fine-fraction mineralogy obtained in the present \n\nstudy were compared with data from the shelf adjacent to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon published \n\nby Oliveira et al. (2007), and data from the Aveiro shelf published by Abrantes (2005). \n\nThe methodology used in the laboratory to analyse the samples was the same in all three \n\nstudies. However, different from the present study, the other two studies considered also \n\nthe accessories minerals (i.e. minerals occurring with a mean concentration &lt;1 % such \n\nas siderite, opal, haematite, pyrite). To make the data sets comparable, the percentage of \n\neach mineral from the other areas was recalculated after removing the accessories \n\nminerals. \n\nThe bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments as described by the \n\nabove authors is qualitatively similar to that found in the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines \n\nshelves. All the main minerals found in the southern area are also present on the shelf \n\n\n\n4.

However, dolomite \n\nwas only identified on the shelf immediately north of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and on the \n\nAveiro shelf. This mineral, which occurs in high concentration (> 8 %) in both areas at \n\ndepths greater than 100 m, is considered to be derived from dolomitic rocks outcropping \n\nin both areas (Abrantes, 2005 and Oliveira et al., 2007). On the other hand, Mg-calcite \n\nwas only identified in the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines area on the inner and middle shelf. \n\nThe remaining minerals are the same in both areas: phyllosilicates, quartz, calcite, K-\n\nfeldspars, plagioclase and aragonite. Concentrations of feldspars (plagioclase and K-\n\nfeldspars) are higher in the shelf areas adjacent to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (median of 10 % \n\nfor each of both groups of minerals) than on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf (mean of 8 \n\nand 5 %, respectively) and the Aveiro shelf (7 and 6 %, respectively). Conversely, \n\nphyllosilicates have higher median concentrations in the southern area. Mean \n\nconcentrations of quartz are similar for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf and the shelf \n\nadjacent to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Table 4.4) while values are lower on the Aveiro shelf. \n\nThis is probably a result of dilution by calcite which is extremely high (> 80 %) in some \n\nparts of the Aveiro shelf where rock outcrops predominate. \n\n \n\nTable 4.4.

It should be noted, however, that \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 101\n\nin the latter area the shallowest sediment samples are more than 10 km away from the \n\nTagus outlet. In the northern shelf areas these high ratios (> 6) are achieved in the inner \n\nshelf (less than 5 km from the coast) and rapidly decrease to constantly lower values \n\n(&lt;6) in the middle and outer shelf while in the Lisbon shelf values around 12 are still \n\nfound close to the shelfbreak (~30 km from the Tagus Estuary). This dispersal of the L/C \n\nratio suggests a more efficient transport of terrigenous sediments from the mainland to \n\nthe shelfbreak in the Lisbon shelf compared to the other northern shelf areas. \n\nThe highest L/C values on the Aveiro shelf are found north from the Ria de Aveiro \n\ncoastal lagoon (Figure 4.21), where they seem to be related to areas of important coastal \n\nerosion. In this area the highest rates of coastal retreat of the Portuguese coast are \n\nmeasured, with values between 3 and 9 m year-1 (Andrade et al., 2006); for the period \n\nbetween 1947 e 1958 Oliveira et al. (1982) determined a rate of retreat of 8 m year-1. \n\nContents of phyllosilicates are higher on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf than on the \n\nshelf adjacent to Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and the Aveiro shelf (Table 4.4), as illustrated by the \n\nPhy/Qz+Felds ratio (Figure 4.22). This is consistent with the observation that sedimentary \n\ndeposits with fine fraction contents higher than 90 % are more widespread in the \n\nsouthern area (Figure 2.2). But even when sedimentary deposits with similar contents of \n\nfine sediments are compared those of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf still have higher \n\ncontents of phyllosilicates than the shelves further to the north. Deposits with fine fraction \n\ncontents between 50 and 90 % have average contents of phyllosilicates of 12 % in the \n\nnorthern area, compared to 31 % in the southern area. This difference in phyllosilicates \n\ncontents is most likely primarily related to the presence of rivers debouching on the \n\nsouthern shelf area, especially the Tagus River, delivering large volumes of fine-grained \n\nsuspended sediment to the shelf. Differences in hydrodynamic regimes of northern and \n\nsouthern shelf areas may play an additional role. Whereas the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and part of \n\nthe Sines shelves are sheltered by the Estremadura mainland from the prevailing swell \n\ncoming from N and NW, favouring the settling of fine-grained material rich in \n\nphyllosilicates, the northern shelf is directly exposed to the highly energetic swell \n\n(Magalh\u00e3es, 2001). \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 102 \n\n4.6.3. Sources of fine-grained sediment and its deposition on the Lisbon, \n\nSet\u00fabal and Sines shelves \n\n \n\nSignificance of the fine fraction in Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf deposits \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf areas display a high variability of sedimentary \n\ndeposits in terms of the dominant grain size. These sedimentary deposits show a general \n\nalong-shelf gradient of decreasing fine fraction content from the Lisbon shelf to the Sines \n\nshelf, as well as an across-shelf gradient of decreasing grain size from the coast outward \n\nto deeper water. \n\nThe along-shelf gradient is directly related to the supply of fine-grained material to \n\nthe Lisbon shelf by rivers, and the sheltered position of this area. Given the present high \n\nsea-level stand, sediment discharged from estuaries to the shelf mainly consists of fine-\n\ngrained suspended material (e.g. Magalh\u00e3es, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2008). From north to \n\nsouth, the Tagus River debouches on the Lisbon shelf, the Sado River (a smaller river) \n\ndebouches on the Set\u00fabal shelf, whereas the Sines shelf has no connection to any \n\nimportant river. \n\nThe across-shelf gradient is easily explained by grain size sorting across the shelf as \n\nsediment is transported from the mainland to the deep sea and also by decreasing \n\ninfluence of wave energy on the seabed as water depth increases. \n\nWithin the fine fraction of shelf deposits, significant variability is observed in terms of \n\nmineralogy and grain size distribution (and geochemistry as will be discussed in the next \n\nchapter) which essentially follow the above-mentioned general patterns. \n\nMineralogical characteristics of the fine-grained sediment fraction reflect a general \n\nincrease in sediment maturity from deposits with overall high content of fine sediment to \n\ndeposits poor in fine-grained material: \n\n\u2022 There is a progressive increase of the KI and decrease of the EI (Figures 4.13b, \n\nc) from sandy deposits (fine-grained sediments &lt;10 %) to mud deposits (fine-\n\ngrained sediments > 90 %) which indicates that fresher illites occur in the latter \n\ndeposits. This conclusion results from the fact that the more time the illites \n\nspend in the marine environment the higher order (lower KIs values) they \n\nachieve in their crystallographic structure by incorporating K+ (Millot, 1964; \n\nNemecz, 1981). This same observation was made by Oliveira et al. (2002) in the \n\nnorthern Portuguese shelf. Furthermore, illites enriched in Fe (EI &lt;0.3) are less \n\n\n\n4.

Thus, fresh clay contents have \n\nhigher contents of Fe-enriched illites (assuming all original illites for a given area \n\nhave similar contents of Fe); \n\n\u2022  The kaolinite crystallinity index shows less degraded kaolinites in the muddy \n\ndeposits (Figure 4.13e); \n\n\u2022 Plagioclase contents also indicate less mature sediments in the muddy deposits \n\nhowever in this case the relationship is not so obvious in Figures 4.5 and 4.11c \n\nbecause, as it will be seen below, high contents of plagioclase are also present in \n\nsome areas of the inner shelf (coarse sediment deposits) as a result of inputs \n\nfrom nearby sediment sources. \n\nGrain size characteristics of the fine-grained sediment fraction also show differences \n\naccording to the overall contents of fine sediments. Higher percentages of clay-sized \n\nmaterial are found in deposits with overall low content of fine sediment, whereas low \n\npercentages of clay-size material occur in deposits rich in fine-grained material (Figures \n\n4.1 and 4.2b). \n\nSand deposits have therefore more mature fine fractions and have higher contents of \n\nclay-size particles while muddy deposits have less mature fine sediments and lower \n\ncontents of clay-size particles. \n\nThe most likely explanation for the relative increase in clay-sized particles within the fine \n\nfraction towards coarser deposits is that these particles cohesively attach to sand-sized \n\nparticles, making their removal from waves and currents more difficult. Since nowadays \n\nthe hydrodynamic conditions do not allow the deposition of clay-size particles where sand \n\ndeposits occur, clay-size fraction material seem to be mainly relict particles, which were \n\ndeposited during times when sea level was lower. On the other hand, sediments within \n\nthe range of \u201csortable silt\u201d (10-63 \u00b5m) were eluted from these sand deposits during the \n\nsea-level rise in the Holocene. Mud patches on the shelf and mud deposits found on the \n\nupper slope have a higher content of particles within the \u201csortable silt\u201d range (Figure \n\n4.23). Possibly, these particles include both recent material sourced by present-day \n\nestuaries as well as relict material removed from the shallower deposits and transported \n\noffshore during the course of the Holocene sea-level rise. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Percentage of \u201csortable silt\u201d in the fine fraction against weight percentage of fine fraction in \nshelf sediments. \n\n \n\n \n\nIdentification of fine sediment sources based on mineral distribution \n\nThe mineralogy of the fine fraction reflects the variable input of two main marine \n\nsediment components: lithogenic material and biogenic carbonate. Generally, the \n\nimportance of biogenic components only increase in areas where lithogenic input (from \n\nrivers, erosion of the coast, desert dust, etc) is not important. In accordance, the general \n\nsouthward increase of calcite on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf indicates a decreasing \n\ninput of lithogenic material from the area off Tagus Estuary towards Cape Sines (Figure \n\n4.25). The following discussion referring to the identification of fine sediment sources \n\nbased on mineral distribution will focus on each shelf area (Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines) at \n\na time. \n\n \n\nOn the Lisbon shelf (and upper slope), considering sediments from deposits with \n\ncontents of fine sediments > 50 %, plagioclase has a negative correlation with water \n\ndepth (Figure 4.24a). This points to a progressive distance to the sediment source, in this \n\ncase mainly the Tagus Estuary. Plagioclases are good indicators of \u201cfresh\u201d lithogenic \n\nsediment because, from the mineralogical assemblage found in the bulk mineralogy, they \n\nare the less resistant minerals to weathering processes (Meunier, 2005), especially in the \n\nmarine conditions (Rothwell, 1989). \n\nDespite the obvious contributions of kaolinite from the Tagus River to the shelf this \n\nmineral does not show a negative correlation with water depth as plagioclases (Figure \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 107\n\n4.24b). It seems therefore that in the Lisbon shelf another sediment source is contributing \n\nas well with sediments enriched in kaolinite.  \n\nIn the adjacent coastal area an important well known sediment source to the beach \n\nsystem are the sea-cliffs. The Mio-Pliocene deposits outcrop as sea-cliffs throughout the \n\nentire coastal arc between Traferia and Cape Espichel but only constitute part of the \n\nbeach profile in the southern half of the coastal arc between Fonte da Telha Beach and \n\nCape Espichel (Figure 2.12). Between Fonte da Telha Beach and the Albufeira Lagoon, \n\ncliffs are made of Plio-Pleistocene detritic deposits, have slopes higher than 45\u00ba and \n\naccumulate considerable amounts of sediments as dejection cones at the base of the cliff. \n\nIn contrast, south of the Albufeira Lagoon, Miocene clayey deposits predominate and cliffs \n\nget slopes around 70\u00ba with much smaller cones of dejection (Teixeira, 1990). In \n\naccordance, this author reports that the Plio-Pleistocene cliffs contribute with more \n\nsediment to the beach system than the Miocene cliffs as they are less resistant to aerial \n\nerosion. \n\nIf one assumes the cliffs made up on Plio-Pleistocene deposits have a similar clay \n\nmineralogy signature to those cliffs with the same age found in the neighbour coastal arc \n\nbetween Tr\u00f3ia and Sines (Table 4.5) they may well be an additional source of kaolinites to \n\nthe Lisbon shelf when storms remove sediments from the beach system. Since these \n\nsame deposits are depleted of plagioclase they cannot represent a source of these \n\nminerals to the shelf. \n\n \n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n\nWater depth (m)\n\nP\nla\n\ngi\noc\n\nla\nse\n\n (%\n)\n\na)\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n\nWater depth (m)\n\nK\nao\n\nlin\nite\n\n (%\n)\n\nb)\n\nFigure 4.24. Contents of a) plagioclase and b) kaolinite in samples from the Lisbon shelf and upper slope \nwith contents of fine sediments > 50 %, plotted against water depth.  \n\n \n\nThe relatively high contents of plagioclase and kaolinite on the Lisbon shelf extend to \n\nthe northwestern part of the Set\u00fabal shelf (Figures 4.5 and 4.16) indicating that there \n\nmight be some input of sediments from the Lisbon shelf to the northwestern Set\u00fabal \n\nshelf. Relatively high contents of quartz on the Lisbon shelf also seem to extend to \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 108 \n\nnorthwestern Set\u00fabal shelf (Figure 4.3). Jouanneau et al. (1998) also considered the \n\npossibility of exchange between the two shelf areas based on the distribution of As, Se, \n\nNi, and Mo in shelf sediments. In their view the Sado shelf (here referred to as Set\u00fabal \n\nshelf) forms a specific domain where contributions from the Tagus River can be noticed \n\nbut are of relatively minor importance compared to contributions from the Sado River. \n\n \n\nOn the Set\u00fabal shelf contents of carbonates are higher than on the Lisbon shelf, \n\nreflecting a decrease in lithogenic input. However, locally enhanced concentrations of \n\nplagioclase and kaolinite, highlight certain areas of the Set\u00fabal shelf as terrigenous \n\nsediment depocentres, for example the Sado mud patch and the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nHigh contents of calcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite in the fine fraction of sandy deposits \n\nclose to the inlet of the Sado Estuary (maximum values of 22, 13, and 24 %, respectively) \n\nindicate that terrigenous suspended sediment coming from the Sado Estuary is bypassing \n\nthe sandy deposits of the inner shelf and only deposits on the Sado mud patch. Probably \n\nthe upper Set\u00fabal Canyon also receives some input from the Sado Estuary, although the \n\nestuarine signal is much weaker here than on the mid-shelf mud patch. This may either \n\nreflect an absolute decrease in particles reaching the upper canyon or a relative decrease \n\ndue to dilution with particles coming from the shelf south of the canyon which have a \n\ndifferent mineralogical signature (see Figures 4.5 and 4.7 for plagioclase and calcite, \n\nrespectively). Most conceivably, mixing of material from the two sediment sources \n\ntogether creates a new mineralogical signature in the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. The \n\nsediment input to the Set\u00fabal Canyon is further discussed in Chapter 6. \n\n \n\nOn the Sines shelf, in general, lithogenic sediment input appears low and therefore \n\ncarbonates, especially calcite, reach their highest values. There are several areas though \n\nwhere lithogenic input can be traced, especially on the inner shelf (Figure 2.25): \n\n1) The coastal area adjacent to the Sines shelf is characterised by beach-cliff profiles \n\nalternating with beach-dune profiles. The presence of Plio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs along the \n\nsouthern half of the coastal arc is the result of erosion of the coast which, according to \n\nMarques (1999), can reach coastal retreat rates around 0.5 m year-1. From the \n\nmorphology of the sea-cliff [cf. photos iii) and iv) of Figure 2.13] it appears that the \n\nerosion of these cliffs is mainly caused by run-off, producing dejection cones at the base \n\nof the cliffs. Characteristics of the fine-fraction and clay-fraction mineralogy of these sea-\n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 109\n\ncliffs are presented in Table 4.5. High contents of phyllosilicates and relatively high \n\ncontents of K-feldspars are found in the fine fraction, and high contents of kaolinite in the \n\nclay fraction. The beach sediments between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines are characterised by high \n\ncontents of kaolinite in the clay fraction, especially in the central portion of the coastal arc \n\n(Jesus et al., 2006). According to Freitas et al. (1999) cliff debris contribute with up to \n\n90 % of the sediments in the beach system. Sea-cliffs are therefore an important \n\nsediment source for the beach system in this area. The transfer of these sediments to the \n\nshelf occurs during winter storms, when waves wash sediments off the backshore area of \n\nthe beach. Studies of sediment dynamics in the coastal zone show that storm waves \n\ncause offshore sediment transport while fair-weather waves and swell return the \n\nsediments shoreward (e.g. Komar, 1976; Wright &amp; Short, 1984; Lee et al., 1998; Van \n\nRijn, 2009). Sand-sized particles are normally not transported deeper than the closure \n\ndepth (the depth beyond which there is no significant seabed changes due to seasonality \n\nor to storms; it is around 6 and 15 m at Tr\u00f3ia and close to Sines, respectively \u2013 \n\nQuevauviller, 1988) while most of the fine-grained particles are washed from the sands \n\nand carried off to the inner shelf or even deeper. This is especially true for the southern \n\nhalf of the Tr\u00f3ia-Sines coastal arc where sea-cliffs are present and contribute with \n\nsignificant amount of fine material to the beach. \n\n \n\nTable 4.5.

Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 110 \n\nContributions of sediments from the sea-cliffs to the shelf are best tracked by the K-\n\nfeldspar contents (Figure 4.26). On the inner shelf concentrations of this mineral reaches \n\nvalues higher than those found in the cliff sediments. This apparent enrichment results \n\nfrom sorting by the high hydrodynamic energy conditions found on the inner shelf. The \n\nmore easily resuspendable minerals like phyllosilicates are selectively removed to settle in \n\ncalmer areas. In addition to enrichment by winnowing, other sources of K-feldspars may \n\ncontribute to high contents in inner shelf surface sediments, as discussed below. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.25. Interpolation of lithogenic/carbonates ratio for fine fraction surface sediments using an inverse \ndistance weighted technique. \n\n \n\n2) The Santo Andr\u00e9 and Melides lagoons may represent another source of lithogenic \n\nsediment input to the shelf, even though their connections to the sea are closed during \n\nmost of the year. An artificial inlet is opened every year in order to exchange the water of \n\nthe lagoons. The mineralogy and geochemistry of bottom sediments from the Santo \n\nAndr\u00e9 Lagoon was studied by Jesus et al. (2007). The fine fraction of surface sediments \n\nfrom this lagoon is characterised by high contents of phyllosilicates (39 \u2013 62 %) and \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 111\n\nquartz (21 \u2013 34 %), while plagioclase contents vary from 2 to 11 %. Sediment input from \n\nthese coastal lagoons may be tracked more clearly by plagioclase contents. Once again as \n\na result of hydrodynamic sorting, contents of plagioclase in inner shelf sediments are \n\nhigher than those from the source. \n\nJesus et al. (2007) found that the Santo Andr\u00e9 Lagoon has a specific geochemical \n\nsignature (high contents of Mn and Pb) which can be tracked in the adjacent beach \n\nsystem. That study showed that even though the lagoon is opened to the sea only once \n\nper year it does leave a measurable signature in the sediments of the adjacent shelf. In \n\nthe next chapter this topic will be discussed further. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.26. Interpolation of K-feldspars concentrations for surface sediments using an inverse distance \nweighted technique. \n\n \n\n3) The Sines sub-volcanic complex represents a third distinct source of lithogenic \n\nsediments that can be tracked in the southern part of the coastal arc. Part of the complex \n\nconstituting the protruding Cape Sines crops out below sea-level, on the shelf adjacent to \n\nthe cape. Since this massif is made of exotic rocks in comparison to the surrounding \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 112 \n\ngeology its imprint is relatively easy to track. In the fine fraction the most obvious mineral \n\nrelated to the Sines sub-volcanic complex is plagioclases. This mineral must be derived \n\nfrom the massif because the sea-cliffs contain only very low amounts of plagioclase (Table \n\n4.5). Plagioclase is enriched in the inner shelf (Figure 4.27) and in beach sediments close \n\nto the cape (Jesus et al., 2007). When studying the heavy mineral fraction of beach \n\ndeposits between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines, Miranda et al. (2007) also found the signature of the \n\nCape Sines subvolcanic complex in a marked increase in amphiboles and pyroxenes in the \n\nsouthernmost 10 km approaching the cape. Pombo et al. (2004) found a similar \n\nassemblage rich in amphiboles and pyroxenes in the inner shelf of the same area. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.27. Interpolation of plagioclase concentrations for fine fraction surface sediments using an inverse \ndistance weighted technique. \n\n \n\nWhereas on the Sines inner shelf lithogenic input from the sea-cliffs, Sines \n\nsubvolcanic massif and the coastal lagoon can be distinguished on the basis of \n\ncharacteristic mineral signatures, also confirmed by other studies using geochemical and \n\n\n\n4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 113\n\nheavy mineral markers, these different sediment sources can not be distinguished further \n\noffshore on the middle shelf area below about 100 m WD (Figure 4.25). \n\nThe above inferences on dispersal of inner shelf sediments nourished by the sea-cliffs \n\nand coastal lagoons are in accordance with current models of sedimentary dynamics for \n\nthis coastal area. According to the SNIRLit (2010) (and references therein) the net \n\nlongshore drift of sediments in the coastal area between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines is directed \n\ntowards the south in most of the coastal stretch. For instance, Silva et al. (2007) reported \n\nsouthward longshore drifts in the Comporta Beach (15 km south from Tr\u00f3ia) and Maretec \n\n(2008) confirmed the southward drift for the southern part of the coastal arc. This last \n\nstudy included ADCP current measurements recorded throughout a year (April 2007 \u2013 \n\nApril 2008) covering the entire water column above the inner shelf (40-60 m WD). In this \n\narea mean currents are parallel to the coastline and directed preferentially towards the \n\nsouth with current speeds mainly between 10 and 30 cm s-1, reaching 60 cm s-1 at the \n\nwater surface at higher wind speed. Similar results were obtained with MOHID numerical \n\nmodel, considering the wind from different directions (Figure 4.28). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.28.

Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments \n\n 114 \n\nOnly in the northernmost part of the coastal arc (Tr\u00f3ia Peninsula) where waves are \n\nrefracted northeastward across the Sado submarine delta, net longshore drift of \n\nsediments is directed towards the north. In addition, during winter storms (representing a \n\nfew days per year) the sediment transported otherwise southwards may undergo \n\nimportant redistribution towards the north as the longshore drift of sediments is \n\ntemporarily reversed (Quevauviller, 1987).  \n\nThe sediment samples collected in the inner shelf correspond to a sediment column \n\nof ~15 cm and therefore contains an integrated signal which covers seasonal and \n\ninterannual variability. The high contents of plagioclase in the inner shelf south of Santo \n\nAndr\u00e9 Lagoon is possibly related to contributions from the coastal lagoons when these are \n\nopened to the sea and also as a result of northward transport of sediments from the \n\nsurrounding area of the Sines massif.  \n\n \n\nIn the following chapter elemental concentrations from surface sediments from the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf will be presented. As referred to above, the combination of \n\nmineralogical data with elemental concentration data will allow a better identification of \n\nsediment sources and assessment of sediment dispersal. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5.

Introduction \n\nThe elemental composition of marine sediments is determined primarily by the \n\nmixture of particulate components that make up the bulk of the sediment. These \n\ncomponents include lithogenic material derived from continental erosion, their \n\ncomposition reflecting the geology of the source area, as well as biogenic material \n\nproduced in the marine environment. Trace elements, generally occurring in very low \n\nabundance at the Earth\u2019s surface, may become enriched in certain marine deposits, due \n\nto their high affinity to particulate matter, and under influence of physical sediment \n\nsorting and diagenetic alteration. In general, enhanced concentrations of trace metals in \n\nrecent surface sediments, especially in the continental shelf environment, reflect \n\nanthropogenic input of trace metals in addition to input from natural sources. The \n\ndistinction of contributions from both sources and the study of the anthropogenic fraction \n\nof elements may be relevant not only for assessment of anthropogenic impact in marine \n\nenvironment but also to highlight pathways of recent sediment transport. For the latter \n\npurpose, particle-reactive chemical species which are adsorbed to the surface of particles \n\nare especially good tracers. Since the majority of anthropogenic contaminants are derived \n\nfrom the mainland they may be used to track recent input of terrigenous sediments and \n\nto identify the main depocentres of recent sediments. The potential of these tracers \n\nincreases as the signatures of the potential sources are better known. \n\nA common misconception is to interpret environmental impact of trace metal \n\ncontaminants and dynamics of their dispersal and accumulation solely on the basis of total \n\nconcentration within the surface sediment. From this simplistic perspective, deposits with \n\nthe highest concentration are considered to pose the greatest risk to the ecosystem and \n\nto represent the depocentres of recent sediments. However, the risk posed by trace metal \n\ncontaminants is not merely a function of their concentration in the sediment, but also of \n\ntheir mobility and reactivity in the environment, the latter depending on chemical \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 116 \n\ncharacteristics of both the contaminant and the sedimentary substrate. Whereas trace \n\nelements may be loosely bound and bioavailable in one type of sediment, they may be \n\ntightly bound in another type of sediment (Horowitz, 1991). In addition to that, higher \n\ncontents of trace metals in certain areas may be related to the presence of source-rocks \n\nwhich are naturally rich in these elements. In such case inferences on sediment transport \n\nassuming that trace metal enrichment is due to anthropogenic input will lead to erroneous \n\nresults. \n\nThe distinction of the natural and anthropogenic fraction through bulk concentrations \n\nis complicated by the unequal distribution of trace metals over different grain size \n\nfractions and different components of the mineral and organic matrix. For this reason, \n\ntrace metal contents are usually assessed within a defined grain size fraction, and \n\nnormalized against a common major element representative for the natural sediment \n\nfraction. Such normalization procedures are especially important where samples from \n\ndifferent sedimentary settings are compared. After normalization, trace metal contents in \n\ncontaminated recent sediments can be compared with contents in older, non-\n\ncontaminated sediments from a similar environmental setting. The observed recent excess \n\nin trace metal content can then be directly interpreted as the anthropogenic input. \n\nThe main goals of the present chapter are: \n\n1) To determine concentrations of major and trace elements in the fine fraction of \n\nsurface sediments from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf area; \n\n2) To assess the geographic patterns of trace metal enrichment in the studied shelf \n\narea; \n\n3) To infer about sources of trace metals and sediments in order to gain insight into \n\nthe pathways of recent sediment transport in the studied shelf area. \n\n \n\n5.2. Spatial distribution and relationships between elements \n\nTable 5.1 shows the main descriptive statistics of major and trace element \n\nconcentrations in surface sediments of the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves. Overall, \n\nmean concentrations of Fe, Al, Ti, Mg, Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, As, Th and U are highest on the \n\nLisbon shelf and lowest on the Sines shelf, whereas the reverse pattern is observed for \n\nCa, Cr and Ni.

Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 124 \n\nFactor 2 (19 %) distinguishes between elements that prevail in nearshore versus \n\nmore offshore areas; Cr and Ni, most abundant in inner shelf sandy deposits, and Pb, As \n\nand Mn, most abundant in fine-grained deposits near the major river mouths, load \n\nnegatively on Factor 2.

Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 125\n\n \n\nFactor 3 (12 %) is determined mostly by negative loadings of Cu and Zn, which have \n\nhigher concentrations in localised fine-grained sediment deposits offshore the major river \n\nmouths (Figure 5.5c).

Of these two elements Cu is the one with the highest \n\nnegative score for this factor meaning that it is the one with the better defined spatial \n\ndistribution, with high contents in specific areas and low contents in most of the \n\nremaining area. As will be shown below, Cu is the least widespread of the trace elements \n\nshowing recent enrichment.  \n\nThe formation of Factor 4 (7 %) is not entirely understood. Except Al, all elements \n\nscoring negatively on Factor 4 (all below 0.5) are trace elements which show \n\nanthropogenic enrichment (Figure 5.4c). The elements scoring positively are mostly the \n\nmajor elements with no evidence for enrichment. \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Comparison between shelf and deeper environments \n\nAs discussed above, spatial variability in major and trace elemental concentration in \n\nsediments of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf is considerable. However, no significant \n\ndifferences are found between elemental concentrations on the Sines outer shelf (100-\n\n200 m WD) and the Sines upper slope (200-500 m WD), except maybe for Pb which \n\nseems to increase offshore (see Table A4.1 in Appendix A4).  \n\nThe surface sediments collected on the Sines slope (1000 \u2013 3900 m WD) have \n\nconsistently higher concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni than the mean concentration \n\nfound in the Sines upper slope (Figure 7.3 \u2013 pg. 194 vs. Table A4.1). Lead on the other \n\nhand has consistently lower concentrations on the Sines open slope than the mean value \n\nobtained for the upper slope. This difference between Pb and the other trace metals \n\npoints out to different pathways of transport and will be discussed further in Chapter 7. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Selection of a normaliser \n\nIn order to calculate enrichment factors (EFs), trace metal contents were normalised \n\nusing a conservative common element (cf. Chapter 3). Since both common elements Fe \n\nand Al showed no significant difference of number and level of correlations with trace \n\nmetals (Figure 5.3) and the analysis of both showed a good accuracy (> 97 %), both \n\nappear suitable for normalising the trace element concentrations. Iron was chosen as \n\nnormaliser in order to make enrichment factors calculated for shelf sediments comparable \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 127\n\nto those obtained in Chapter 7 for the adjacent submarine canyons and open slope.

Relationships between trace elements and mineralogy \n\nIt is commonly observed that trace metals and grain size show a linear relationship \n\nas trace elements tend to accumulate in the finer fractions (cf. section 5.1). In the \n\npresent study, however, none of the studied elements shows a significant correlation \n\nhigher than |0.45| with mean grain size, modal grain size or with the percentage of clay-\n\nsized particles (Table 5.2). \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.

Phyllosilicates correlate with some trace elements (Cu and Zn) \n\nand Al and Fe while, as expected, carbonates correlate with Ca. On the other hand, the \n\nrelationship between the various elements and clay mineralogy is less obvious, at least \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 128 \n\nfrom a chemical point of view (cf. see below). Table 5.3 shows that kaolinite is the clay \n\nmineral with the highest positive correlations with trace elements while illite shows a \n\nnegative correlation with trace elements. Smectite has some minor correlations with some \n\ntrace elements. \n\nThe adsorptive capacities of the various clay mineral groups for trace elements is \n\nhighly variable, depending on the negative charge on the broken edges of the layered \n\nsheets that result from the isomorphic substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ in the tetrahedral layer, \n\nand Mg2+ or Fe2+ for Al3+ in the octahedral layers. In the case of kaolinite, very little \n\nsubstitution occurs. Thus, its net negative surface charge, and its potential to adsorb \n\ncations to external surfaces, is limited. This factor explains its relatively low cation \n\nexchange capacity (CEC) because the exchange process is limited to external surfaces. In \n\ncontrast, isomorphic substitution can be extensive in the 2:1 smectite clay mineral group, \n\nparticularly within the octahedral layers. As a result they exhibit a relatively high net \n\nsurface charge that promotes cation adsorption. Moreover, smectites tend to exhibit a \n\nrelatively high CEC because the individual sheets are weakly bound together, and cations \n\nand water can penetrate between the sheets and participate in exchange processes. \n\nDespite the above, in the study area kaolinite shows better correlation with trace metals \n\nthan smectite. This may be partly related to the narrow range of values observed for \n\nsmectite content (P25 - P75 = 2 - 3 %). In addition, as already seen in Chapter 4, \n\nkaolinite distribution on the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves appears to reflect input more \n\nclosely than smectite. Since conceivably the rivers are also the main source of trace \n\nmetals, it seems logical that trace metals are carried off the estuaries in association with \n\naggregates formed by the more common kaolinites. Coatings of organic matter and Fe \n\nand Mn hydroxides precipitated on clay particles may further enhance the adsorptive \n\ncapacity of clay minerals (Jenne, 1976). \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.

Comparison to sediment quality guidelines \n\nThe sediment quality guideline (SQG) of the National Oceanic Atmospheric \n\nAdministration (NOAA), developed to assess biological effects of metal contamination, \n\nclassifies different levels of metal concentration as \u201cEffects Range-Low\u201d (ERL) and \u201cEffects \n\nRange-Medium\u201d (ERM). These ERL and ERM represent, respectively, the 10th and 50th \n\npercentiles of the available dataset for different trace metal components (Long et al. \n\n1995). The ERMs are supposed to represent concentrations above which adverse \n\nbiological effects are expected to be common, whereas ERLs represent concentrations \n\nbelow which effects are expected to be rare. Between these values effects are expected \n\nto happen occasionally. Obviously, this classification is rather arbitrary since it is merely \n\nbased on the statistics of the available data, and chemical concentrations do not directly \n\ncorrespond to sediment toxicity (O\u2019Connor &amp; Paul, 2000). \n\nConcentrations of the trace elements considered in the present study (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, \n\nCr and Ni) are found to exceed the ERL value in a considerable number of samples from \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf (Table 5.4). Concentrations of Pb, Cr and Ni exceed the \n\nERM value in a number of samples in all three shelf areas. Lead, Zn and Cu show a \n\nsouthward decrease in the percentage of samples with contents above the ERL (Table \n\n5.4) whereas Cr shows a southward increase of samples exceeding the ERL and ERM. \n\nNickel and As concentrations are above the ERL value in almost all samples, and Ni \n\nexceeds the ERM in a considerable number of samples, increasing towards the south. \n \n\nTable 5.4.

Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 130 \n\n5.4.2. Enrichment factors \n\nThe level of trace metal enrichment in sediments can be assessed through different \n\nindexes and methods (e.g. Loring &amp; Rantala, 1992). In this study, the enrichment of trace \n\nmetals in surface sediments from the shelf was assessed through enrichment factors \n\nusing Fe as the normaliser (cf. Chapters 3 and 7) and using trace metal concentrations of \n\npre-industrial sediment (older than ~150 years) as baseline (cf. Chapter 3). Since a pre-\n\nindustrial baseline was not determined for As, enrichment could not be calculated for As. \n\nLead, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni are variably enriched throughout the continental shelf and \n\nupper slope (Figure 5.6 and Table 5.5), locally by a factor 25 in the case of Pb. Zinc and \n\nPb show a considerably higher percentage of samples which are significantly enriched (43 \n\nand 88 %, respectively) than Cu, Cr and Ni. Most of the samples not enriched in those \n\ntrace metals occur on the Sines shelf, especially on the outer shelf and upper slope, and \n\nin the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. While sediments enriched in Pb extend over most of the \n\nstudy area, the area with significant enrichment in Zn appears to be more restricted to \n\nthe Lisbon shelf and a relatively narrow area close to the coast on the Set\u00fabal and Sines \n\nshelves. The highest EFs of Pb (7 - 25) occur in the Sado and Tagus pro-delta deposits \n\nwhile the highest EF of Zn (3 - 12) occur in the Sado pro-delta deposit, along the coastal \n\narc between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines and in the Tagus mud patch (Figure 5.6a, b). \n\nEnrichment of Cu, Cr and Ni appears especially associated with sandy deposits of the \n\ninner shelves (Table 5.5). From the five trace metals considered Ni and Cr are the ones \n\nwith the lowest percentage of samples enriched (25 and 28 %, respectively). Yet, these \n\nelements show the highest EFs (22 and 26, respectively) in the inner shelf sandy deposits \n\nof the Sines shelf. Most likely, however, the baseline used is not appropriately \n\nrepresenting the fine fraction of these sandy deposits. Thirty percent of the surface \n\nsamples are enriched in Cu, most of which are from sandy inner shelf deposits and only \n\nfew from mud patches on the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves. Among various other areas on \n\nthe inner shelf, high EFs of Cu occur close to the Sado River mouth in the Sado pro-delta \n\ndeposit (Figure 5.6c). \n\nEnrichment factors of Pb and Zn (and Cu to some extent) decrease with increasing \n\nwater depth, whereas a relationship with water depth is not observed for Cr and Ni \n\n(Figure 5.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5.

Discussion \n\nOn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf the elemental geochemistry of the fine-grained \n\nsediment fraction appears to a large extent determined by the amount of fine fraction. \n\nThe Lisbon shelf is largely covered by fine-grained deposits of the Tagus mud patch, while \n\ntowards the south, on the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, deposits rich in fine-grained material \n\nare less widespread (Figure 2.3, page 22). In accordance, elements typically associated \n\nwith fine-grained sediments (Al, Fe, Ti and U) show a southward decrease in mean \n\nconcentrations (Table 5.1). As a result of the low input of fine-grained lithogenic \n\nsediments in the southern area, relatively coarse sediments with high contents of shells \n\ndominate the area. This is in turn expressed in the fine fraction by generally high \n\nconcentrations of Ca. \n\nAlthough trace metals are in general mostly associated with lithogenic input, trace \n\nmetal distribution on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf show spatial patterns that differ from \n\nthe distribution of elemental proxies of lithogenic and biogenic material. The differing \n\npatterns of trace metals and proxies of lithogenic material such as Al indicate that there \n\nmust be other trace metal carriers involved and/or a portion of the contents of trace \n\nmetals cannot be explained by the existing concentrations of metal carriers, and may \n\nrepresent anthropogenic enrichment. Considering the spatial distribution pattern of the \n\nstudied trace metals and the correlations among them, two groups with different \n\nbehaviour can be distinguished: i) Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn and ii) Ni, Cr. \n\n \n\n5.5.1. Copper, lead, zinc, arsenic and manganese \n\nThe most obvious difference between the distribution patterns of Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn \n\nand that of Ni and Cr is that elements from the first group show higher concentrations in \n\nsediments close to the inlets of estuaries and coastal lagoons (Figure 5.2). This is most \n\nconceivably related to co-precipitation of these trace elements with Mn and Fe \n\n(hydr)oxides. The efficiency of Mn oxides as trace metals scavengers in the lower \n\nestuaries is well documented (e.g. Zwolsman and van Eck, 1999 and reference therein). \n\nHowever, the trace metals which are affected by this scavenging process may be different \n\nfrom estuary to estuary depending on the prevailing chemical, physical, biological and \n\nhydrological characteristics of the estuary (Byrd et al., 1990). Cortes\u00e3o (2002) studied the \n\nreactivity of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni and Co in the lower Sado Estuary and concluded that Mn co-\n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 135\n\nprecipitation is the main process affecting particulate Co. This author considers however \n\nthat this process may well be critical in the coastal area as well. Unfortunately, Pb, Zn and \n\nAs were not considered in the referred study. \n\nWithin the group made by Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Mn different affinities between \n\nelements are observed. Zinc and Cu appear more closely related to lithogenic material, as \n\nrepresented by Al, Fe and phyllosilicates, than Pb, As and Mn (Tables 5.2 and 5.3). \n\nApparently Zn and Cu are less controlled by precipitation of Mn oxides than the former \n\ntrace metals and may be more affected by terrigenous materials and/or organic matter \n\nforming aggregates with clay minerals. Zinc and Cu accumulation in sediments may to \n\nsome extent also be biologically controlled in relation to primary production. The \n\nrelationship of Cu with primary production is further discussed in Chapter 7, dealing with \n\ntrace metal distribution in sediments of deeper areas of the continental margin. However, \n\non the shelf this process seems of less importance as shown by the close relationship of \n\nCu and Zn with Al, Fe and phyllosilicates. \n\nEnhanced concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, As together with Mn are also observed on \n\nthe inner shelf adjacent to the Melides and St. Andr\u00e9 lagoons. These coastal lagoons are \n\nnaturally closed off from the sea by a sand bar but every spring (March/April) both \n\nlagoons are artificially opened to promote water exchange with the open sea, with the \n\nobjective of preventing eutrophication. According to Freitas et al. (1999) the artificial \n\nopening of some SW Portuguese coastal lagoons (Melides, St. Andr\u00e9 and Albufeira) is a \n\ncommon practice since the 18th century. The subsequent closing of the inlet by natural \n\nprocesses may take days (Melides), weeks (St. Andr\u00e9) or even months (Albufeira) (Freitas \n\net al., 2000). Natural overwash of the sand bar used to occur in the past during storms \n\nand high water levels within the lagoon, but has become less frequent due to increased \n\nregulation of the maximum levels of inundation of the lagoons. \n\nWhile closed off from the open sea, the stagnant waters of the lagoons become \n\ndistinctly stratified, as expressed in vertical gradients in temperature, salinity, turbidity, \n\npH and dissolved oxygen. Depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water, observed \n\nduring prolonged periods of stagnation (e.g. Freitas et al., 2000; Cearreta et al., 2002) \n\nleads to lowering of the redox potential, and as a consequence reduced Fe and Mn are \n\nreleased from the bottom sediments to the overlying water. When the lagoon is again \n\nopened to the sea, precipitation of Mn oxides will occur as water flowing from the lagoon \n\nmixes with well-oxygenated sea water. In addition, the opening of the bar causes \n\nlocalised erosion and remobilization of superficial sediments and organic matter from the \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 136 \n\nbottom of the lagoon, and export to open sea (Freitas et al., 2000). Jesus et al. (2005) \n\nfound high contents of Mn and various trace metals in beach sediments from the area \n\nadjacent to these lagoons, distinctly higher than in other areas of the coastal arc between \n\nTr\u00f3ia and Sines. The high contents of trace metals and Mn in beach and adjacent shelf \n\nsediments may additionally result from precipitation of Mn oxides as lagoonal water \n\npercolates through the permeable sand of the bar and emerges on the beach, driven by \n\nwater level differences between lagoon and sea. However, the high contents of \n\nplagioclase found in the fine fraction of beach and shelf sediments from this area, \n\nsupposedly sourced by the Santo Andr\u00e9 and Melides lagoons, suggest that indeed the \n\nopening of these lagoons to the sea has an impact on the composition of beach and shelf \n\nsediments from the surrounding area. \n\nApart from the above-mentioned mechanism enhancing the export of trace metals to \n\nthe shelf and beach system, the St. Andr\u00e9 Lagoon is by itself rich in Mn, Zn and Pb \n\n(Freitas et al., 2000; Piedade et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2007). The relatively small \n\ndrainage basin discharging into the lagoon comprises schists and volcano-sedimentary \n\nrocks which are relatively rich in the above-mentioned elements (Figure 2.18, pg.47). \n\nManganese and Fe were even extracted in the past from the now abandoned Saramaga \n\nmine (Santos Oliveira et al., 2002). Similar lithologies rich in trace metals are not found in \n\nthe drainage basins discharging to the Melides and Albufeira Lagoons, and as a \n\nconsequence these lagoons are probably less important as trace metal sources to the \n\nshelf than the St. Andr\u00e9 Lagoon. \n\n \n\n5.5.2. Nickel and chromium \n\nThe correlation between Ni and Cr seems to be very strong, whereas the two \n\nelements show only a very weak correlation with any of the other studied elements \n\n(Figure 5.3). Cortes\u00e3o (2002) reported this same relationship between Cr and Ni for the \n\nsuspended particulate matter from the Sado Estuary (both upper and lower estuary) and \n\nthe adjacent coastal area water. This same strong positive relationship between both \n\nelements was also found, for instance, in suspended particulate matter of the Scheldt and \n\nRhine estuaries (Zwolsman &amp; van Eck, 1999 and van de Meet et al., 1985, respectively) \n\nand in surface sediments of the Sena and Mondego estuaries (Boust, 1981 and Vale et al., \n\n1994). All these examples point to a common process of incorporation of these two \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 137\n\nelements in the particulate phase, yet the mechanism involved is not revealed by the data \n\nhere presented. Since the highest values are found in sandy deposits of the inner shelf \n\nrich in biogenic carbonate it may be that Cr and Ni are enriched by a biological process or \n\nsimply by weathering of some heavy mineral concentrated in the coarser fractions.  \n\n \n\n5.5.3. Enrichment of trace metals \n\nThe percentage of samples showing significant trace metal enrichment (EF > 1.5) per \n\nelement follows the sequence: Pb (88 %) > Zn (43 %) > Cu (30 %) > Cr (28 %) > Ni \n\n(25 %). Generally, the enrichment of trace metals tends to decrease with increasing \n\nwater depth, suggesting that the excess of trace metals must be derived from land \n\n(Figure 5.6 and Table 5.5).  \n\nThe areas of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf most affected by enrichment of trace \n\nmetals include the entire Lisbon shelf, the Sado mud patch and the inner shelf between \n\nTr\u00f3ia and Sines. \n\nEnrichment of Pb and Zn on the Lisbon shelf and the Sado mud patch, and of Cu in \n\nthe latter area points to the nearby Tagus and Sado estuaries as the likely sources of \n\nenrichment. Indeed, high trace metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota due to \n\nanthropogenic activities have been reported for both estuaries (e.g. Cott\u00e9-Krief et al., \n\n2000; Caeiro et al., 2005; Fran\u00e7a et al., 2005). \n\nOn the inner shelf between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines, decreasing levels of enrichment of Pb, \n\nZn and Cu in southward direction, along with the prevailing longshore drift of sediments \n\ntowards south (except in the northern most portion) (SNIRLit, 2010 and references \n\ntherein) suggests once more that the Sado Estuary is the most likely source for these \n\ntrace metals. Since enrichment of Cr and Ni on the inner shelf decreases in opposite, \n\nnorthward direction, and since these elements are not enriched in the Sado mud patch \n\nnourished by the Sado Estuary, it seems that these elements are not sourced by the Sado \n\nEstuary, but rather seem to come from the south. Two different sources of particles may \n\nexplain this enrichment:  \n\n1) The enrichment of Cr and Ni may be due to relatively abundant presence of heavy \n\nminerals in these sediments nourished by the Sines sub-volcanic complex. In a study of  \n\nthe heavy mineral fraction in beach deposits between Tr\u00f3ia and Sines, Miranda et al. \n\n(2007) also found the signature of sub-volcanic rocks, in the form of an increase in \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 138 \n\namphiboles and pyroxenes in the southernmost 10 km of the coastal arc. Pombo et al. \n\n(2004) found this same assemblage in the inner shelf of this same area. If there is indeed \n\na natural source of enhanced Cr and Ni contents in sediments of this area, the calculated \n\nenrichment factor (EFs ~20 in some areas) is very likely too high because the baseline \n\nvalue used for the calculation refers to pre-industrial sediments from deeper areas  (see \n\nFigure 3.2, pg. 52) where heavy minerals are rare. \n\n2) Another source of Cr and Ni might be the Sines submarine outfall located ~2 km \n\nnorthwards from Sines which started to operate in 1978 (Cardoso &amp; Palma, 2007). It \n\nmainly discharges industrial wastewater from an important industrial complex in the \n\nvicinity of Sines. The structure reaches to 3.2 km offshore and releases wastewater at \n\n40 m WD (Maretec, 2008). At the time when the sediment samples were collected \n\nanother outfall in the city of Sines was still operational and discharging in front of Cape \n\nSines. Nowadays it is deactivated. Two monitoring studies done in sediments from the \n\nsurroundings of the first outfall (Cardoso &amp; Palma, 2007; Maretec, 2008) showed that \n\nthere is no important enrichment of trace metals in the bulk sediments, which in this case \n\nare coarse sands. These studies are of limited use, however, to evaluate the possible \n\nimpact of these releases on sediment samples shown in the present study because: i) The \n\nabove-mentioned studies refer to the bulk sediment &lt;2 mm, while the present study is \n\nconsidering the fine fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m); ii) Presently, the wastewater discharged by the \n\nSines submarine outfall undergoes secondary treatment but possibly the treatment was \n\nless extensive at the time when the sediment samples here presented were collected \n\n(1980-1987). This input of trace metals to the inner shelf would have affected the area \n\nnorthwards from the submarine outfall especially during storms when the longshore drift \n\nis reversed to a northward direction. \n\nFrom the two hypotheses, the first seems the more likely in view of the observed \n\nenrichment of heavy minerals in beach and shelf sediments from the southern half of the \n\ncoastal arc, and also in view of the lack of correlations between Cr and Ni and other \n\nelements (Figure 5.3). \n\nSince the enrichment of Pb is found to extend over a much wider area of the shelf \n\nand upper open slope than that of other trace elements, it can be deduced that other \n\nsources of excess Pb must exist apart from the rivers discharging terrigenous sediments \n\nto the shelf. Another source of contamination potentially involving the whole studied shelf \n\narea concerns atmospheric input. This subject will be further discussed in section 7.4.1 of \n\n\n\n5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope \n\n 139\n\nChapter 7 where stable lead isotope signatures are used to identify potential sources of \n\nlead in the canyons. \n\nAs mentioned before, the sediment samples from the shelf here presented were \n\ncollected between 1980 and 1987, which implies that they may not represent the present \n\nstate of contamination of the shelf. Present-day shelf sediments could be expected to be \n\nless contaminated with trace metals, after improvement of industrial and domestic \n\neffluent treatment and closing of some industrial point sources in both the Tagus and \n\nSado estuaries during the past two decades. During this time leaded gasoline was also \n\ngradually phased out, starting in the early 1990s and completely eliminated only in 1999 \n\n(Roma-Torres et al., 2007). However, Mil-Homens et al. (2009), in a study of trace metal \n\naccumulation in sediments from the Tagus mud patch during the last 80 years (1920 - \n\n2000), concluded that sediments dated between 1980 and 2000 show constant \n\nenrichment values of trace metals, presumably due to the homogenising effect of \n\nbioturbation in the surface mixed layer. EFs between 1980 and 2000 obtained by these \n\nauthors are indeed very similar to those obtained in the present study for the same area \n\n(Table 5.6). \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, the enrichment factors found in grab samples from the outer shelf/upper \n\nslope (Chapter 5) are comparable to those found in the same area in the top 0.5 cm of \n\nTable 5.6.

Introduction \n\nDespite of being a major topographic feature of the Portuguese margin, the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon system so far was not studied in detail with regard to modern sediment \n\ntransport and deposition. This is in contrast with the relatively geographically close Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon. Recently, studies by Arzola et al. (2008) and Lastras et al. (2009) focused on the \n\ngeneral morphology and large-scale sedimentary structures of the above canyons, on the \n\nbasis of analysis of seafloor geophysical data. Inferences about late glacial to Holocene \n\nsedimentation in the middle and lower reaches of the canyons were made, based on the \n\nanalysis of piston-cores. Even more recently Garc\u00eda et al. (2010) published a study on \n\nbioavailable organic matter in suspended aggregates and surface sediments, sediment \n\ndeposition rates and mixing intensities in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nThis chapter is intended to give more insight into the recent sedimentary processes \n\nacting in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon system by looking at:  \n\n1) up- and down-canyon horizontal sediment fluxes obtained by near-bottom \n\nmeasurements of turbidity and current velocities;  \n\n2) sediment deposition fluxes measured with sediment traps;  \n\n3) sediment accumulation rates measured in cores using 210Pb geochronology;  \n\n4) general composition and grain size of surface sediments and suspended \n\nparticulate matter; \n\n5) bulk and clay mineralogy of surface sediments and suspended particulate matter. \n  \nData on surface sediments from the Cascais Canyon are presented for comparison \n\nwith the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon system in terms of sediment accumulation rates, general \n\ncomposition and mineralogical contents of surface sediments. Comparisons with the \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 144 \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon will be frequent since a similar approach making use of data collected with \n\nsediment traps and surface sediment cores was previously applied to this canyon by De \n\nStigter et al. (2007b), covering the entire canyon structure. \n\n \n\n6.2. Near-bottom hydrodynamics, horizontal sediment flux and mass \n\ndeposition flux \n\nBOBO (BOttom BOundary) benthic landers were deployed in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon to record current dynamics in the near-bottom water layer, in combination with \n\ntemporal variation of temperature, salinity, turbidity and mass deposition flux. Seven \n\ndeployments were done at different depths along the canyon axis: three were done in the \n\nLisbon Canyon (497, 1070 and 1858 m WD), two in the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon (972 and \n\n1324 m WD), one in the middle canyon (2716 m WD) and one in the lower Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon (4402 m WD). One deployment was done on the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau \n\n(1213 m WD). \n\nBOBO lander records of near-bed current dynamics show moderately strong currents \n\nin the entire Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, directed predominantly along the canyon axis and \n\ntypically alternating in up- and down-canyon direction with a semi-diurnal frequency. \n\nMean current speeds varied between 6.2 and 12.1 cm s-1 and were generally higher in the \n\nupper canyon reaches (Table 6.1). \n\nIn the Lisbon Canyon, deployments at 497 and 1070 m WD (stations 269-02 and \n\n252-34, respectively) were of short duration (7 and 12 days, respectively) and done \n\nduring summer time (May 2007 and September 2006, respectively). For both \n\ndeployments, sharp peaks in turbidity, indicating resuspension of sediment from the \n\nseabed, occurred when current speed exceeded 20 cm s-1 (Figure 6.1a, b). Whereas \n\nhigher average current speeds and mass deposition fluxes were measured in the \n\ndeployment at 497 m (269-02) (Table 6.1), both deployments displayed a net up-canyon \n\nSPM transport of around 4000 g m-2 d-1. Figure 6.2 shows the location of the three BOBO \n\ndeployments in the Lisbon Canyon. \n\nA different sedimentary setting was found in the lower part of the Lisbon Canyon \n\nduring a deployment of 12 months at 1858 m water depth (station 225-03).

Considering the entire Set\u00fabal Canyon, a \n\nnet down-canyon horizontal flux was only recorded at 1324 m WD, representing a net flux \n\nof about 2000 g m-2 d-1 (Table 6.1). The other three deployments displayed negligible \n\nhorizontal net fluxes (&lt;100 g m-2 d-1). Despite this apparent lack of sediment transport, \n\nespecially in the middle and lower canyon, the deepest deployment at 4402 m WD \n\nrecorded relatively high current speeds reaching peaks of 50 cm s-1 (Figure 6.1g).

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 147\n\npeaks in current speed were accompanied by relatively low and stable values of turbidity \n\nshowing no signs of resuspension. Possibly there was little material to resuspend at this \n\nsite, in contrast with the upper canyon where fine mud is always abundantly present. \n\nAccordingly, sediment deposition rates measured in the sediment trap at 4402 m WD \n\nwere between 0.4 \u2013 1.4 g m-2 d-1, the lowest values measured in the entire canyon and \n\ncomparable to those measured on the adjacent open slope (see below). The strong \n\nalong-canyon alignment of currents and their high speed noticed in this record (Appendix \n\n5, Figure A5.2) are in agreement with the observation that the canyon thalweg at this \n\ndepth lies confined between steep canyon walls of hundreds of meters high (cf. section 3 \n\nof Figure 2.6c, on pg. 25 of Chapter 2). Arzola et al. (2008) and Lastras et al. (2009) \n\nreported localised grooving at the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon mouth (4170 m WD) and \n\nrelated those with enhancement of turbidity currents as a result of narrowing of the \n\ncanyon by a debris avalanche. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3.

Figure 6.3e indicates \n\nNW - WNW directed net sediment fluxes in the area, generally along with the poleward \n\nflow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) along the slope. During this short period \n\nof deployment mass sediment deposition fluxes between 0.3 and 1.2 g m-2 d-1 were \n\nrecorded. \n\n \n\n6.3. Sediment accumulation rates (vs. mass deposition fluxes) \n\nSediment accumulation rates (SAR) measured in cores using 210Pb geochronology \n\nvary from 0.8 to 20.8 g m-2 d-1 in the canyons while on the open slope values range from \n\n0.5 to 2.7 g m-2 d-1 (Figure 6.4). The relatively lower sediment accumulation rates \n\nmeasured on the open slope (and in the lower canyon) are most probably overestimates. \n\nSince a surface mixed layer could not be distinguished from an unmixed subsurface layer, \n\nsediment accumulation rates were calculated under the (probably incorrect) assumption \n\nthat bioturbation is negligible. Even so, the above ranges of values indicate preferential \n\ndeposition of sediments in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons rather than on the \n\nadjacent open slope. \n\nOf the six cores in the Lisbon Canyon for which SARs were determined, the highest \n\nvalue of 20.8 g m-2 d-1 was measured at ~1100 m water depth while SARs of 15.2 and \n\n3.9 g m-2 d-1 were measured in other cores collected at 367 and 1856 m WD, respectively. \n\nIn the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon a similar pattern was observed with the highest sediment \n\naccumulation rate around 1300 m WD; however, comparing both upper canyons, values \n\nare consistently higher in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.4). Down-stream after the merging \n\nof the two canyon branches, SARs tend to decrease with depth reaching a value of \n\n0.8 g m-2 d-1 around 4400 m WD. In the Cascais Canyon there is a regular offshore \n\ndecrease of sediment accumulation rates from 11.0 g m-2 d-1 at 445 m WD down to 1.4 g \n\nm-2 d-1 at 3900 m WD. \n\nSARs on the Sines open slope are comparable to those in the slope adjacent to the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, ranging between 0.5 and 3.1 g m-2 d-1. On the Estremadura and \n\nMondego open slopes, located northwards of the above canyon, SARs are generally lower \n\nthan at comparable depths on the Sines open slope. \n\nBy dividing the dry bulk density of the 0-0.5 cm slice of sediment cores by the SAR \n\nvalues obtained for the cores, average linear sedimentation rates of 0.39, 0.19, 0.13 and \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 150 \n\n0.06 cm yr.-1 were determined for the upper (Lisbon and Set\u00fabal), middle and lower \n\ncanyon reaches, respectively, and 0.09 cm yr.-1 for the adjacent open slope. Thus, 0.5 cm \n\nof sediment (the slicing interval for the surface sediment here considered) is equivalent to \n\n~1.5 - 4 years of accumulation in the upper and middle Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, and to ~6 \n\n- 8 years in the lower canyon and slope regions. \n\nFor both the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal Canyon, sediment deposition fluxes measured in \n\ntraps deployed upstream of 1500 m WD are higher than SARs determined for cores \n\ncollected at corresponding water depths (Figure 6.4). This is most likely due to cumulative \n\ntrapping of resuspended sediment clouds produced during consecutive tidal cycles. On the \n\nother hand, in the lower-canyon (and conceivably in the middle-canyon) where \n\nresuspension events are less common, sediment fluxes measured in traps span a range of \n\nvalues comparable to sediment accumulation rates obtained in nearby sediment cores. \n\n \n\n \n\nEpisodic high sediment fluxes were not observed in the sediment trap time series for \n\nany of the seven deployments within the canyon, suggesting that sediment gravity flows \n\nlike the ones described for the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon by De Stigter et al. (2007b) are not \n\nfrequent in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. Over a time span that is comparable to that \n\nrepresented by the sediment traps of the present study, these authors observed a \n\nnumber of events occurring at various depths along the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis, with \n\nsediment fluxes 5 to 50 times higher than the average flux for a given deployment. \n\n \n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\n100.0\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nWater depth (m)\n\nS\nA\n\nR\n a\n\nnd\n M\n\nD\nF \n\n(g\n m\n\n-2\nd-\n\n1 )\n\nFigure 6.4.

General characteristics of surface sediments and suspended \n\nparticulate matter (grain size, general composition and Corg/N ratios) \n\n6.4.1.  Surface sediments  \n\nSurface sediment cores brought up from the axis of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nconsisted of soft muddy sediment with very little coarse material. Reduced dark grey to \n\nblack sediment below a thin oxidized surface layer indicated a high content of organic \n\nmatter. Piston-cores collected from the Lisbon and upper Cascais canyons (252-34 and \n\n252-36, respectively) consisted also of dark olive grey silty clay, with intercalations of \n\nmedium sand (De Stigter et al., 2004 and 2007a). In a core collected from the lower \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (225-07), a turbiditic sand layer at 15-20 cm depth indicates sporadic \n\nmass transport of sand-sized material. Multi-cores collected in the slope adjacent to the \n\ncanyon (236-10, 225-20, 225-21) and at the open slope transects consisted of yellowish \n\ngrey carbonate-rich silty clay with a well-developed oxidised layer (De Stigter et al., 2004 \n\nand 2007a). Pteropod shells and living arborescent foraminifera were commonly found on \n\nthe surface (Figure 3.6). \n\nSurface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal as well as the \n\nCascais Canyon have modal grain sizes generally between 8 and 50 \u00b5m, and occasionally \n\ncoarser than 50 \u00b5m, whereas finer modes less than 8 \u00b5m are found in the middle and \n\nlower reaches of these canyons (Figure 6.5). On the adjacent shelf and upper slope, \n\ncoarser sediments are generally found with modes coarser than 65 \u00b5m, and locally at \n\ndepths between 500 and 1500 m even coarser than 150 \u00b5m. At greater depths, open \n\nslope sediments have finer grain size modes below 8 \u00b5m. Surface sediments in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon tend to be slightly coarser than sediments at comparable depth in the other \n\ncanyons, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon where modes \n\napproach 50 \u00b5m. Only in the deepest cores from the canyon, fine grain size modes were \n\nobserved, comparable to those in the lower reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais \n\ncanyons and the lower slope. \n\nVariation in surface sediment bulk composition is presented in Figure 6.6 for different \n\nbathymetrical transects (Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons and adjacent slope, Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon, Sines, Estremadura and Mondego open slopes). Canyon surface sediments are \n\ncomposed of 72 \u2013 87 % non-carbonate lithogenic material, 10 \u2013 25 % carbonate, and 1.4 \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 152 \n\n\u2013 5.0 % organic matter while surface samples from the adjacent slope are composed of \n\n69 \u2013 78 % non-carbonate lithogenic material, 20 \u2013 27 % carbonate and 1.4 \u2013 2.8 % \n\norganic matter. In both the Lisbon and Cascais canyons the highest contents of lithogenic \n\nmaterial are found in the canyon head, decreasing down-canyon until around 2000 m \n\nwater depth where contents reach values of 73 and 75 % respectively (Figure 6.6a, c). In \n\nthe upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, contents of non-carbonate lithogenic material are lower and \n\nalso tend to decrease with increasing water depth, reaching values of 73 % already at \n\n595 m water depth (Figure 6.6b). Below 2000 m water depth, contents of non-carbonate \n\nlithogenic material show a slight increase with depth in both the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nCascais canyons. Contents of organic matter are higher in the canyon sediments than in \n\nsediments of the adjacent slope (Figure 6.6d). Along the canyon axis higher \n\nconcentrations of organic matter appear in sediments collected around 500-1300 m WD in \n\nthe Lisbon Canyon and upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, corresponding to the areas with the \n\nhighest sediment accumulation rates, and around 900-1000 m WD in the Cascais Canyon. \n\nSurface sediments from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon have contents of non-carbonate lithogenic \n\nmaterials consistently above 80 %. Biogenic silica, which in the present study is included \n\nin the non-carbonate fraction, presumably contributes very little to the bulk of surface \n\nsediment and sediment trap samples according to the XRD analysis. However, since most \n\nof the biogenic silica is amorphous and present in relatively low amounts, XRD analysis is \n\nnot a good method to identify the presence of this mineral. \n\n \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nWater depth (m)\n\nM\nod\n\ne \n(m\n\nic\nro\n\nns\n)\n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon\nCascais Canyon\nMondego open slope\nEstremadura open slope\nSines open slope\nSlope adj Naz C.\nSlope adj.

Clear differences, \n\nhowever, were observed between samples collected from different sites within the \n\ncanyon.

In this canyon, lithogenic contents \n\nwere found to decrease down-canyon whereas carbonate content showed a relative \n\nincrease, probably reflecting a reduction of terrigenous material input. Organic matter \n\nreached the highest values in the trap deployed at 1070 m WD. In general, the upper \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon showed the lowest contents of lithogenic material, and highest contents \n\nof carbonate, varying from 25 \u2013 27 % at 972 m WD to 24 \u2013 37 % at 1324 m WD.

Variation in lithogenic, carbonate and organic matter contents of suspended particulate matter \ncollected in sediment traps deployed at various depths along the axis of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and on \nthe Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau. The concentration of lithogenic material and organic matter is indicated \nwithin each bar. Numbering of cups and colour codes used in panel f correspond to those used in Figure 6.7.  \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6.9 Corg/N ratio of organic material in sediment trap samples is plotted \n\nagainst carbonate content. The two parameters show a distinct negative relationship: \n\nsamples with lowest carbonate content, and hence highest lithogenic content, contain \n\norganic material with Corg/N ratio around 10 indicative of organic material of mixed marine \n\nand terrigenous origin. Conversely, samples richest in carbonate, and hence lowest in \n\nlithogenic material, contain organic matter with low Corg/N ratio around 7, indicative of a \n\nprevalence of marine organic material. Whereas for most sediment trap deployments the \n\nsamples tend to cluster closely together, the samples from deployment 218-36 show a \n\nconspicuously wide range of carbonate concentrations and Corg/N ratios, indicating a \n\nvariable supply of terrigenous and marine material. For the entire set of sediment trap \n\nsamples, carbonate content tends to be negatively correlated with mass deposition flux, \n\nsuggesting that carbonate content is predominantly determined by dilution with \n\nterrigenous sediment rich in lithogenic material. This is not the case, however, for the \n\nsamples of 218-36, where carbonate contents show no relationship with mass flux. This \n\nfact will be further discussed in section 6.7.1. \n\nWhereas most sediment trap samples plotted in Figure 6.9 fall within a fairly narrow \n\nband of Corg/N vs. carbonate values, samples from traps in the lower Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\n(252-62), the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau (218-01) and the lower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n(218-55) deviate from this general pattern by having organic matter with higher Corg/N \n\nratio for similar carbonate content. \n\nTo illustrate trends in the relative proportion of lithogenic material (assumed to be \n\nmostly terrigenous) versus carbonate (assumed to be mostly of marine origin) the ratio of \n\nlithogenic material versus carbonate (L/C ratio) in sediment trap samples and surface \n\nsediments is plotted in Figure 6.10 against water depth.

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 157\n\nthe Lisbon and Cascais canyons, and its decrease down-canyon shows this ratio is a good \n\nindicator for terrigenous sediment input. In accordance, L/C ratios in the open slope \n\nsamples are consistently lower than ratios obtained in the canyon surface samples for a \n\ngiven water depth. \n\n \n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\nCaCO3 (%)\n\nC\nor\n\ng/\nN\n\n269-02 (LC)\n252-34 (LC)\n225-03 (LC)\n218-36 (USC)\n204-23 (USC)\n204-35 (LSC)\n252-62 (LSC)\n218-01 (OS)\n218-55 (NC)\n\n \nFigure 6.9.

Surface sediment samples with L/C ratios \n\ncomparable to those of the trap samples are to be found at greater depth down-canyon, \n\naccording to the trendline indicated in Figure 6.10. Assuming that most of the material \n\ntrapped in the near-bottom water has undergone multiple cycles of resuspension from the \n\nseabed, the similarity of trap samples with down-canyon surface sediments samples \n\nwould suggest temporary up-canyon SPM transport, as supported by observed up-canyon \n\nwater transport illustrated in Figure 6.2. For the deepest sediment trap site in the Lisbon \n\nCanyon (225-03, 1858 m WD) eleven out of twelve samples have L/C ratios very similar \n\nto those found in surface sediments collected at comparable water depths. In the upper \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon, L/C ratios in sediment trap samples are lower than in surface sediment \n\nsamples from nearby locations. Ratios in trap samples are comparable, however, to the \n\nones obtained for surface sediments of the adjacent open slope, pointing out this area as \n\na likely source of SPM as mentioned above (when referring to Figure 6.9).

Bulk mineralogy of surface sediments and mineralogy of &lt;150 \u00b5m \n\nsuspended particulate matter \n\nLithogenic detrital components of marine sediments, despite all regional variability, \n\ninclude only few basic minerals. With the exception of quartz, complete weathering, \n\nparticularly the chemical weathering of metamorphic and igneous rock, leads to the \n\nformation of phyllosilicates. Consequently, this group represents, apart from quartz and \n\nbiogenic sediments, the most important mineral constituent in sediments. To a lesser \n\ndegree, lithogenic detritus contains unweathered minerals like feldspars. In general, the \n\nrelevant biogenic minerals for sediment formation are only carbonate minerals in the form \n\nof aragonite, Mg-calcite and calcite, as well as biogenic opal in the form of amorphous \n\nSiO2\u00b7nH2O. \n\n \n\n6.5.1.  Bulk mineralogy of surface sediments from canyons and open \n\nslopes \n\nFive main minerals/groups of minerals compose the bulk mineralogy of surface \n\nsediments of the canyons and open slopes: calcite, quartz, phyllosilicates, plagioclase and \n\nK-feldspars. The bulk mineralogy of the surface sediments from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, \n\nCascais and Nazar\u00e9 canyons and open slope is very similar to the assemblage found in \n\nsurface sediments from the shelves adjacent to these areas (Chapter 4), except aragonite \n\nand Mg-calcite were not identified in surface sediments from the canyons and open slope. \n\nIn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons there is an obvious relationship between \n\nbulk mineralogy and water depth. Generally calcite (Cc) and phyllosilicates (Phy) increase \n\nwith water depth whereas quartz (Qz), K-feldspars (Fk) and plagioclase (Plg) follow the \n\nopposite trend (Figure 6.11). Throughout the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon the bulk mineralogy of \n\nsurface sediments does not have a clear trend with water depth. It is clear, however, that \n\nsurface sediments in this canyon have an important component of lithogenic material (Cc \n\n&lt;28 % and Qz > 30 %) except around 5000 m WD where calcite is higher than 30 %, \n\nand feldspars and quartz are below 4 % and 20 %, respectively (Figure 6.11). With \n\nregard to the open slope environment each transect has its own pattern with increasing \n\nwater depth. In addition to that, each transect comprises a different range of water \n\ndepths which turns comparison more difficult, especially for the shallower water depths. \n\n\n\n6.

These trends are less obvious in the Estremadura transect which covers \n\na smaller water depth range than on the other transects.

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 161\n\nSome differences between different areas of the central Portuguese margin in \n\ngeneral and between canyon and open slope environments in particular are apparent in \n\nthe mineralogy of surface sediments.  \n\nTrends in contents of various minerals with water depth are very similar between the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons, especially between the Lisbon and Cascais canyons, \n\nbut they are generally different from those observed in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. Whereas in \n\nthe Lisbon and Cascais canyons calcite contents increase from ~15 % around 500 m WD \n\nto ~40 % at 2000 m WD, calcite contents remain more or less constant ~15 % in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon even at water depths around 4500 m WD. Only toward the deepest part \n\nof the canyon contents of calcite appear to increase (Figure 6.11a). In the Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\ncontents of calcite also remain virtually constant until 4500 m WD yet with higher \n\ncontents of 34 \u2013 37 %. Contents of quartz and feldspars tend to be higher in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon than at equivalent water depths in the southern canyons (Table 6.2 and Figure \n\n6.11). This is especially clear for quartz which shows a difference in contents all the way \n\nthrough the canyons, whereas for feldspars similar contents are observed in the upper \n\nreaches of the canyons. Contents of phyllosilicates are again similar in the upper reaches \n\nof the canyons but further down-canyon contents are higher in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nCascais canyons compared to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\nComparing the three open slope areas, the Sines open slope transect has the lowest \n\ncontents of calcite and highest in phyllosilicates for equivalent water depths. These \n\ncontents are in good agreement with those of samples collected from the edges of the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (Figure 6.11a, c). The Mondego open slope is marked by \n\nconspicuously higher contents of quartz and feldspars compared to the other two open \n\nslope transects. The Estremadura open slope has the highest contents of calcite. \n\n \n\nLithogenic minerals versus calcite \n\nThe ratio of lithogenic minerals Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg against calcite (Cc) highlights the \n\nareas more affected by fresh input of terrigenous lithogenic input in a similar manner as \n\nthe lithogenic/carbonate ratio described in 6.4.2, since normally carbonate contents only \n\nincrease where input of lithogenic material is relatively low. \n\nIn the Lisbon Canyon a pronounced decrease of the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio with \n\nwater depth is observed from the canyon head region down to about 2000 m WD, and a \n\nsimilar pattern is seen in the Cascais Canyon (Figure 6.12a). A markedly lower ratio is \n\nobserved in the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, which remains more or less constant with \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 162 \n\nincreasing depth down-canyon. In the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio is \n\ngenerally higher than in the former canyons, and no clear relationship with water depth is \n\nseen. All three canyons systems have higher values of the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio in the \n\ncanyon thalweg compared to adjacent open slope areas. \n\nThe Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratios in sediments of the Estremadura and Sines open \n\nslopes are comparable or lower than those found on the edges and slopes of the canyons. \n\nThe ratio is slightly higher in the Sines open slope transect compared to the Estremadura \n\nopen slope and also to the Mondego open slope below 1500 m WD. \n\n \n\nPhyllosilicates / Quartz + Feldspars ratio \n\nThe Phy/Qz+Feld ratio may give insight into the hydrodynamics of a given area since \n\nphyllosilicates tend to settle in calmer areas compared to quartz and feldspars. It might \n\nbe used as well to track the mineralogical contributions of a given source of sediments. \n\nIn both the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons there is a general increase of the \n\nPhy/Qz+Feld ratio with increasing water depth (Figure 6.12b). The lowest ratio of ~0.5 \n\noccurs in the Lisbon Canyon around 350 \u2013 450 m WD, whilst it increases to more than 1.0 \n\naround 1100 m WD. In the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon the ratio remains below 1.0 all the way to the \n\nlower canyon but around 5000 m WD the ratio doubles to around 2.0. \n\nIn the open slope environment this ratio tends to increase as well with increasing \n\nwater depth (Figure 6.12b). Both in the Sines and Mondego transects the ratio starts with \n\nvery low values of &lt;0.2 on the inner shelf, rapidly increasing to >1.5 at depths around \n\n1000 m WD on the Sines open slope, whereas on the Mondego open slope a more \n\ngradual increase with water depth is observed, to values which are lower than on the \n\nSines open slope at equivalent depths. Data for the Estremadura open slope are only \n\navailable for depths below 1000 m WD, but here the ratio appears comparable to that \n\nobserved on the Sines open slope. On the slope adjacent to the Nazar\u00e9  \n\nCanyon the ratio is somewhat in between vales observed for the Mondego and \n\nEstremadura open slopes. \n\n \n\nFeldspars / Phyllosilicates ratio \n\nThe ratio of feldspars against phyllosilicates may give insight into the maturity of \n\nsediments. Feldspars are less resistant to weathering than phyllosilicates and the former \n\nmay be precursors of the latter. Since the two mineral groups have very different \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 163\n\nhydraulic characteristics this ratio should preferably only be used for comparison of areas \n\nwith comparable hydrodynamic regimes.  \n\nThrough most of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons the Felds/Phy ratio in \n\nsurface sediments gently decreases against water depth. A conspicuously high ratio is \n\nobserved in sediment in the upper reaches of the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.12c). \n\nIn surface sediments from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon the ratio is more scattered with no \n\nclear relationship with water depth. Values are generally higher than those obtained for \n\nthe southern canyons, which indicates a lower maturity of sediments in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon. \n\nRatios for the shelf and open slope as presented in Figure 6.12c seem to indicate a \n\ngeneral decrease of Felds/Phy ratios from the Mondego to the Sines transect. Differences \n\nbetween the northernmost and southernmost transect are most pronounced on the shelf \n\nand upper slope, decreasing toward greater depths. Around 3500 m WD both transects \n\nhave similar ratios. The other studied areas generally have intermediate values for this \n\nratio. On the Mondego open slope there is again an increase of the ratio around 5000 m \n\nWD. \n\n \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons Nazar\u00e9 Canyon Slope surface sediments \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nQ\nz+\n\nP\nhy\n\n+F\nk+\n\nP\nlg\n\n/C\nc\n\nLisbon traps\nSet\u00fabal traps\nLisbon cores\nSet\u00fabal cores\nCascais cores\n\na)  \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nQ\nz+\n\nP\nhy\n\n+F\nk+\n\nP\nlg\n\n/C\nc Nazar\u00e9 traps\n\nNazar\u00e9 cores\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nQ\nz+\n\nP\nhy\n\n+F\nk+\n\nP\nlg\n\n/C\nc\n\nNazar\u00e9 adj\n\nSet\u00fabal adj\n\nSines  \n\nEstrem adura\n\nMondego\n\n30\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nP\nh\n\ny \n/ Q\n\nz+\nFe\n\nld\n\nb)  \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nP\nh\n\ny \n/ Q\n\nz+\nF\n\nel\nd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nP\nh\n\ny \n/ Q\n\nz \n+ \n\nF\nel\n\nd\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater Depth (m)\n\nF\nel\n\nds\n / \n\nP\nh\n\ny\n\n1.4\n\nc)  \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater Depth (m)\n\nF\nel\n\nd\ns \n\n/ P\nhy\n\n1.1\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater Depth (m)\n\nFe\nld\n\ns \n/ P\n\nhy\n\nFigure 6.12.

Mineralogy of &lt;150 \u00b5m suspended particulate matter (vs. surface \n\nsediments) \n\nGenerally the mineralogy of particulate material collected in sediment traps along \n\nthe canyon axes shows similar trends against water depth to those defined by the surface \n\nsediments (Figure 6.11 and 6.12). However, as seen for bulk sediment components in \n\nsection 6.4.2, contents of various components may differ systematically between trap \n\nsamples and surface sediments. \n\nCalcite contents in samples from individual sediment trap deployments commonly \n\nspan relatively narrow ranges and are comparable to values observed in surface \n\nsediments at similar water depths, for as much as the upper canyon reaches are \n\nconsidered. However, in deeper areas of the canyons (~4500 m WD in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon and already at 3000 m WD in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon), sediment trap samples have \n\nhigher contents of calcite compared to underlying surface sediments (Figure 6.11a). The \n\nQz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio shows this same trend along both Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 \n\ncanyons being however more obvious in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\nFor phyllosilicates trap samples have normally higher contents than those found in \n\nunderlying surface sediments. On the other hand, for coarser minerals as quartz and \n\nfeldspars trap samples have lower contents compared to surface sediments at equivalent \n\nwater depths. The Phy/Qz+Feld ratio summarises these differences between surface \n\nsediment and trap samples which can be tracked throughout the entire canyons, \n\nbecoming nevertheless more evident in the lower reaches of the canyons. In the upper \n\ncanyons resuspension processes caused by high bottom currents speeds occur frequently \n\n(see section 6.2) allowing coarser minerals to be caught in the sediment traps. In the \n\ndeeper areas, however, differences between the mineralogy of suspended particulate \n\nmaterial and surface sediments become more obvious since resuspension processes do \n\nnot occur as frequently as in the upper canyon and material caught in the traps therefore \n\nrepresents mainly the pelagic sedimentation. \n\n \n\n6.5.3.  Comparison between surface sediments from the canyons and \n\nadjacent outer shelf and upper slope \n\nSurface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons (~350 \n\n\u2013 500 m WD) have similar bulk mineralogy with only slight differences: contents of \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 165\n\nphyllosilicates are higher in the Cascais Canyon and contents of quartz and plagioclase \n\ntend to be higher in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.11). The Lisbon outer shelf and upper \n\nslope compared to these canyons has a mean content of phyllosilicates and quartz similar \n\nto those found in the Cascais Canyon head (38 and 30 %, respectively). The Lisbon \n\nCanyon head sediments, on the other hand have higher contents of plagioclase and \n\nquartz than sediments from these two other environments. In fact the \n\nQz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio is also higher in the Lisbon Canyon head (6) compared to the \n\nCascais Canyon (4) and also to the outer shelf/upper slope sediments (4). \n\nSurface sediments from the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon branch have relatively constant \n\nconcentrations of minerals composing the bulk mineralogy. These sediments are \n\ncharacterised by Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratios around 2 and the dominant minerals are \n\ncalcite and phyllosilicates (~35 % each). It follows quartz, plagioclase and k-feldspars \n\nwith ~21, 4-6, 3-4 %, respectively (Figure 6.11). The Set\u00fabal outer shelf/upper slope has \n\nalso a mean Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio of 2 with similar contents of calcite and \n\nphyllosilicates (33 and 23 %, respectively) to those found in the canyon. The Sines outer \n\nshelf/upper slope has even lower mean contents of phyllosilicates (18 %), higher mean \n\ncontents of calcite (43 %) and a mean Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio of 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6.

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 167\n\n6.6.  Clay mineralogy \n\n6.6.1.  Clay mineralogy of canyon surface sediments \n\nAs in the surface sediments from the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves, four groups \n\nof minerals were identified in the clay fraction of surface sediments: illite (60 \u2013 93 %), \n\nkaolinite (20 \u2013 38 %), chlorite (0 \u2013 5 %) and smectite (0 \u2013 4 %).  \n\n \n\nIllite \n\nAs expected for sediments at mid-latitudes of the northern oceans illite is the \n\ndominant mineral in the clay fraction. For the Set\u00fabal Canyon and lower Cascais Canyon \n\nas well as for the open slopes and walls and edges of the canyons contents of illite are \n\nhigher than 70 % (Figure 6.13a). Contents of illite lower than 70 % occur throughout the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon and also in the Lisbon Canyon and upper Cascais Canyon. For the \n\ndifferent transects, contents of illite show no trend with water depth except in the Lisbon \n\nand Cascais canyons where there is a clear seaward increase of their contents. \n\nIn the southern canyons the Esquevin Index (EI) shows with consistence the \n\nfollowing sequence across water depths until ~2000 m: Set\u00fabal Canyon (more Al-rich \n\nillites) > Cascais Canyon > Lisbon Canyon (less Al-rich illites). For the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nvalues are relatively constant with increasing water depth.  \n\nIn the Mondego and Sines transects there is a decrease of the EI with increasing \n\nwater depth until 4000 m WD; from this depth onwards it seems to increase for both \n\ntransects. \n\nIn the southern canyons the Kubler Index (KI) is quite variable compared to the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon where surface sediments have indices which gradually increase seawards. \n\nIn the open slope transects of Sines and Mondego lower KIs occur in the shallowest and \n\ndeepest samples. Across the Estremadura open slope transect the index is quite stable \n\nwith increasing water depth (Figure 6.13c). \n\n \n\nKaolinite \n\nContents of kaolinite are generally higher in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (28 \u2013 38 %) than at \n\nequivalent depths in the southern canyons (22 \u2013 31 %) and open slope areas (21 \u2013 \n\n32 %). In the Set\u00fabal Canyon contents are just slightly higher than those found in the \n\nstudied open slope areas. The percentages of this mineral tend to decrease with \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 168 \n\nincreasing water depth for the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. In the Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 \n\ncanyons and open slope transects there are no clear trends with increasing water depth \n\n(Figure 6.13d). \n\nThe kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) indicates the degree of order of the crystalline \n\nstructure. The higher the value the less ordered the structure is. Referring to the \n\nclassification defined in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.17, on pg. 95), KCI is low (crystalline \n\nkaolinites) throughout the Set\u00fabal Canyon with no significant variation. Similar to what is \n\nobserved on the Lisbon shelf (Chapter 4), crystalline kaolinites also occur in the upper \n\nreaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons (~300 m WD). At 1000 m WD in both canyons \n\na conspicuous increase in the index indicates the presence of semi-degraded and \n\ndegraded kaolinites. Further down-canyon, the KCIs decrease reaching again low values \n\n(crystalline kaolinites similar to those observed in the upper canyon) at 2000 m WD. From \n\nthis point downwards the KCI stays relatively low only with a slight increase in the Cascais \n\nCanyon. In general, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon has low KCIs (crystalline kaolinites) comparable to \n\nthose observed in the Set\u00fabal Canyon with increments of the index around 400 \u2013 900 m \n\nand below 3200 m WD. In the walls and slopes of the canyons values are comparable to \n\nthose observed in the thalweg of the canyons. In the open slope environment values are \n\nmore variable but tend to be higher than those from the canyons. Below 1000 m WD \n\nthere is an increment of the index around 1500 m WD for the Sines and Estremadura \n\nopen slopes. This fact will be discussed in section 6.7.3. The Mondego transect has more \n\nstable values below 1000 m WD than the above transects with a gentle increase of the \n\nKCI with water depth. \n\n \n\nSmectite \n\nContents of smectite in surface sediments are low compared to the other clay \n\nminerals, with values ranging from 0 to 4 %.  Most of the samples have smectite contents \n\nbelow 2 % except for the entire Mondego transect and between 900 and 1500 m WD in \n\nsome of the other transects; from the seven transects studied, only in the Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons and on the Mondego open slope this increase was not detected.  \n\n \n\nChlorite \n\nChlorite contents span a relatively narrow range of values in surface sediments from \n\nthe studied canyons (&lt;4 %) and open slope areas (&lt;6 %). The Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 \n\ncanyons (&lt;2 %) have consistently lower contents of chlorite than the Cascais Canyon. \n\n\n\n6.

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 170 \n\n \n\nThe Lisbon Canyon shows a wider range of contents.

Clay mineralogy of suspended particulate matter \n\nThe clay mineralogy of particulate matter collected in sediment trap shows a wide \n\nvariability and is also generally different from that of the underlying surface sediments \n\n(Figure 6.13). Generally, smectite and chlorite tend to have higher contents in sediment \n\ntrap samples than surface sediments. \n\nThe only clear trend against water depth is observed for smectite, which in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon increase with increasing water depth. \n\nIn general, the Esquevin Index in sediment trap samples spans a wide range of \n\nvalues with tendency to be higher than in the underlying surface sediments. For the \n\nKubler Index one may find the opposite trend in the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon canyons: the \n\nindex tends to be lower in the trap samples compared to underlying sediments. In the \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon this is only found in some areas of the canyon. \n\nFor the kaolinite crystallinity index values span a wide range of values and are \n\ngenerally higher (less ordered structure) in the trap samples compared to the underlying \n\nsurface sediments. \n\n \n\n6.6.3.  Comparison between surface sediments from the canyons and \n\nadjacent outer shelf and upper slope \n\nThe clay mineralogy of surface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and \n\nCascais canyons (~350 \u2013 500 m WD) is very similar between both canyons. Illite and \n\nsmectite contents are the same in both canyons with 66 and 2 %, respectively. Kaolinite \n\nhas higher contents in the Lisbon Canyon than on the Cascais Canyon (31 and 28 %, \n\nrespectively) while the opposite is true for chlorite (1 and 4 %, respectively).

Chlorite and smectite compose the remaining \n\n2 %. Both Set\u00fabal and Sines outer shelves/upper slopes have similar clay compositions to \n\nthe one found in the Set\u00fabal Canyon. The Sines outer shelf/upper slope has slightly \n\nhigher contents of smectite while the northern outer shelf/upper slope has slightly higher \n\ncontents of kaolinite.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 172 \n\n6.7. Discussion \n\n6.7.1.  Recent sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon \n\n \n\nUpper-canyon branches: Lisbon Canyon and upper Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nPrevious work on submarine canyons has established that they may constitute major \n\npathways for the transport of sediment (and associated organic matter) from land to the \n\ndeep ocean, depending on the interplay of various factors. Horizontal and mass \n\ndepositional sediment fluxes are important indicators of the effectiveness of submarine \n\ncanyons in capturing sediments and transporting them to deeper areas.  \n\nRelatively high sediment fluxes recorded in sediment traps and in seabed deposits of \n\nthe canyons on the central Portuguese continental margin are clear evidence of the \n\ndynamic sedimentary environment present within these canyons. SPM concentrations (De \n\nStigter et al., in press) and sediment accumulation rates (SAR) in the upper canyon \n\nreaches are an order of magnitude higher than the ones measured at comparable depths \n\non adjacent slope areas (Figure 6.4), and values reported from other parts of the western \n\nIberian margin (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1984; McCave &amp; Hall, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Van \n\nWeering et al., 2002). \n\nSediment accumulation rates (SARs) measured in seabed sediment cores along the \n\nthalweg of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon show considerable variation with depth. The \n\nhighest values occur between 1100 and 1400 m WD for the Lisbon Canyon and upper \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon. The highest sediment deposition fluxes measured in sediment traps from \n\nthe Lisbon Canyon and upper Set\u00fabal Canyon occur around 1100 and 1400 m WD, \n\nrespectively. In the upper canyon reaches mass deposition fluxes estimated using \n\nsediment traps are consistently higher than SARs determined in the seabed. This is most \n\nlikely due to cumulative trapping of resuspended sediment clouds produced during \n\nconsecutive tidal cycles. In these same areas, De Stigter et al. (2004 and 2007a) detected \n\nwell-developed bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers (BNLs and INLs) around the \n\nintersections of the canyon floor with the upper (500 m) and lower (1500 m) boundaries \n\nof the MOW while further down of the 1500 m isobath intermediate and deep waters \n\napparently cleared up. The only exception was a bottom nepheloid layer of about 500 m \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 173\n\nthick, observed in May 2004 at 2603 m WD (cruise 64PE225). The interaction of the MOW \n\nwith the canyon seabed seems to favour resuspension of sediments which are potentially \n\ntransported by internal tides cycles. At 500 m and between 1000 and 1500 m WD \n\ncurrents reach high speeds allowing cycles of deposition-resuspension.  \n\nDespite the high efficiency of the traps, as indicated in Chapter 3 (pg. 53), the \n\ncomparison between mass deposition flux intercepted by sediment traps and SARs based \n\non 210Pb chronologies, as applied above for the upper canyons may raise questions \n\nbecause SARs are calculated on a longer time scale (~100 years) with regard to the \n\ndaily/monthly/annual trap experiments here presented. Despite this, the comparison \n\nbetween both sets yields consistent information which is in accordance with other \n\nindependent data such as near-bed current speeds. \n\n \n\nDeployment 218-36 in the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, which lasted for around 6 months, \n\nrecorded a considerable temporal variation in composition of the mass deposition flux. \n\nDifferent from what was observed in other deployments in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, \n\ncarbonate contents of trap samples of deployment 218-36 show no relationship with mass \n\nflux. The samples high in carbonate and with low Corg/N ratio (Figure 6.9) thus do not \n\nrepresent periods with reduced supply of lithogenic material through the canyon, but may \n\nreflect enhanced input of sediment from the adjacent open slope. Alternatively, but most \n\nunlikely as this was not seen in the other deployments, the higher concentrations of \n\ncarbonate found between middle January and middle March 2004 (four samples) may \n\nrepresent a change in planktonic community in the water column (calcareous shelled \n\ngroups vs. non-calcareous shelled groups), not necessarily accompanied by a change in \n\nprimary productivity since concentrations of organic carbon did not increase significantly \n\nin this period (Figure 6.8f). In the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, surface sediments collected \n\nfrom the seabed have higher lithogenic material than particulate matter collected in \n\nsediment traps at equivalent water depths (by comparing Figure 6.6 with 6.8 and more \n\nexplicitly in Figure 6.10). The mineralogical composition of surface sediments and trap \n\nsample also shows some differences. Smectite has higher contents in trap samples \n\ncompared to the underlying sediments while the opposite is observed for kaolinite (Figure \n\n6.13 d, f). Figure 6.10 shows how material collected in traps of two deployments in the \n\nupper Set\u00fabal Canyon have similar L/C ratios as surface sediments from the adjacent \n\nopen slope. Therefore, most of the material in trap samples collected in the upper Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon seems to be derived from the adjacent slope/shelf, probably from the southern \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 174 \n\nslope/shelf where surface sediments are characterised by low contents of lithogenic \n\nmaterial (L/C &lt;2, compare Figure 4.11 with 6.12a); low kaolinite contents (&lt;30 %, \n\ncompare Figure 4.16 with 6.13d) and relatively high smectite contents (> 1 %, compare \n\nFigure 4.18 with 6.13f). On the other hand, surface sediments of the upper Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon represent the integrated input of sediment over a longer period of time, with \n\ncontributions from the Set\u00fabal shelf (Sado mud patch or possibly directly from the Sado \n\nRiver) north of the canyon, as suggested by similarity in mineralogy in 6.5.3. \n\n \n\nFrom the higher SARs determined for surface sediments, and higher contents of \n\nlithogenic material and more terrigenous Corg/N signature of organic matter, it appears \n\nthat the Lisbon Canyon receives larger quantities of sediment from the near-shore area \n\nthan the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. This is in accordance with the proximity of the Lisbon \n\nCanyon to the Tagus River, a much more important river in terms of annual mean \n\ndischarge than the Sado River which feeds the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon (cf. Chapter 2, pg. \n\n40). As illustrated in Figure 6.6a, surface sediment from the Lisbon Canyon head shows a \n\ngreat similarity in composition with sediments from the Tagus prodelta (described by Alt-\n\nEpping et al., 2007). Most of the L/C ratios obtained for the Lisbon shelf area range \n\nbetween 6 and 10 (Figure 4.11), comparable to L/C ratios between 8 and 10 found in \n\nsurface sediments from the head of the Lisbon Canyon. Garcia (1997) reported bottom \n\nnepheloid layers on the Lisbon shelf directed towards the Lisbon Canyon under influence \n\nof waves and wind from southwesterly direction. Thus, these bottom nepheloid layers are \n\nconceivably caused by resuspension of shelf sediments, which can probably reach the \n\nLisbon and Cascais canyons during SW storms. However, the conspicuous decrease in L/C \n\nratio in surface sediments further down the Lisbon Canyon suggests that, despite the high \n\ninput of terrigenous sediment to the canyon head, there is no substantial down-canyon \n\ntransport of sediments down the canyon. Conceivably, the strong meandering of the \n\nLisbon Canyon at water depths between 1000 and 1500 m may form an obstruction to \n\ndown-canyon transport of sediments. In fact the highest SAR measured in the whole \n\ncanyon (20.8 g m-2 d-1) was measured in a piston core (252-34) collected just up-slope \n\nfrom where the canyon makes an almost complete 180\u00ba bend (Figures 6.2 and 6.4). In \n\naddition, the highest concentration of organic matter (5 %) is also found in this same \n\ncore (Figure 6.6a) suggesting high input and rapid burial of organic material with little \n\ntime for mineralization. The two BOBO lander deployments located up-slope from this \n\nmeander bend recorded a net up-canyon water flow, and associated up-canyon SPM \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 175\n\nfluxes around 4000 g m-2 d-1 in both deployments. However, surface sediments collected \n\nfrom nearby these lander deployments show a higher proportion of material derived from \n\nthe shelf (expressed in e.g. L/C ratio, Felds/Phy ratio, Phy/Qz+Feld ratio) than the \n\nmaterial collected in the sediment trap deployments. From this it can be inferred that up-\n\ncanyon fluxes recorded with BOBO landers are intermittent in nature, and may alternate \n\nwith periods with predominance of down-canyon transport. Obviously, the short duration \n\nof 7-10 days of the upper canyon deployments is not sufficient to determine whether the \n\nobserved up-canyon flow is an intermittent feature, alternating with down-canyon flow, or \n\nis representative for the longer term circulation in the canyon. Nevertheless, surface \n\nsediment characteristics suggest a decrease in down-canyon transport further down the \n\nLisbon Canyon, possibly as a result of the morphology of the canyon. In the latter case of \n\nmore or less permanent up-canyon flow, it might be related to local diversion of the \n\nalong-slope flow of Mediterranean Outflow Water as it encounters the canyon. Then, the \n\nconspicuous maximum in L/C ratio in surface sediments near the head of the Lisbon \n\nCanyon, and decrease further down-canyon, may in fact reflect the dumping of dredged \n\nsediments from the Tagus Estuary in the Lisbon Canyon, and subsequent up-canyon \n\ndispersal by currents. Recent information from the APL (Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Porto de Lisboa \n\n\u2013 Administration of the Harbour of Lisbon) shows that 8000 m3 and 7500 m3 of \n\ncontaminated sediments dredged from the Tagus Estuary were discharged in the Lisbon \n\nCanyon in 2005 and 2007, respectively (Nemus, 2011). The area used has a radius of 200 \n\nm and central point at Longitude 09\u00ba 19\u2019 W and Latitude 38\u00ba 29\u2019 N (ED50) at around \n\n400 m of water depth (Figure 6.14). According to the APL this same area has been used \n\nby other institutions for discharge of sediments (e.g. military institutions which also \n\ndredge the estuary). The relative impact of these discharges on the natural sedimentary \n\nsystem of the Lisbon Canyon may be assessed by comparing the total mass of dumped \n\nsediment to an order of magnitude estimate of the annual sediment accumulation in the \n\ncanyon thalweg. Taking 38 km for the length of the canyon (Lastras et al., 2009) and \n\n1 km for maximum width of the thalweg and average sediment accumulation of around \n\n8.75 g m-2 d-1 (section 6.3) yields an annual sediment accumulation in the Lisbon Canyon \n\nof around 12 x 1010 g dry weight. Assuming then that 15500 m3 of known discharges of \n\n2005 and 2007 had a dry bulk density of 1000 kg m-3 yields a total dry mass of dumped \n\nsediment of 1.55 x 1010 g, which is 12.8 % of the annual sediment accumulation in the \n\nLisbon Canyon thalweg and 1.6 % of the annual sediment discharge from the Tagus \n\nEstuary into the adjacent shelf. \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 176 \n\nMiddle and Lower Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nDown-slope of the junction of the Lisbon and upper Set\u00fabal Canyon branches mass \n\ndepositional fluxes decrease one order of magnitude from 1 \u2013 5 g m-2 d-1 at 2716 m WD to \n\n0.3 \u2013 1.4 g m-2 d-1 at 4402 m WD, whereas also SARs measured in surface sediments \n\ndecrease (Figure 6.4). Low values of bottom water turbidity observed during both lander \n\ndeployments in the middle and lower canyon (Figures 6.1f and g), and good \n\ncorrespondence between mass deposition fluxes measured in traps and seabed SARs in \n\nthe lower canyon (Figure 6.4) indicate limited resuspension from the seabed and a \n\nprevalence of sedimentation in this part of the canyon. Therefore, in the middle and lower \n\ncanyon internal tides do not appear to be very effective in transporting sediments in up- \n\nor down-canyon directions. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.14. Location of the area used by APL and other institutions to discharge contaminated sediments \ndredged from the Tagus Estuary (marked as a red circle). \n\n \n\nSurface sediments from the middle and lower Set\u00fabal Canyon have lithogenic \n\ncontents between 72 \u2013 77 % (2200 \u2013 4400 m WD) comparable or slightly higher than for \n\nsediments from an equivalent water depth range on the walls and edges of the canyon \n\n(70 % at 2939 m WD) and on the Sines open slope (72 \u2013 75 %, between 2130 and \n\n4987 m WD). L/C ratio and contents of kaolinite, which can be used as tracers for coastal \n\nand riverine inputs of sediments, have contents in surface sediments consistently higher \n\nin the Set\u00fabal Canyon compared to the canyon edge and Sines open slope for equivalent \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 177\n\ndepths (Figures 6.10 and 6.13d). This may indicate that despite the low down-canyon \n\ntransport of sediments from the upper-canyon, the funnel effect of the canyon may be \n\nenough to differentiate sediments from the canyon thalweg against those occurring in the \n\nopen slope and even in the walls of the canyon. Conceivably, a larger input of lithogenic \n\nmaterial from the adjacent shelf during winter months, due to increased river discharge \n\nand higher frequency of storms, may be included in the time-integrated record of seabed \n\nsediment, but may not be present in the suspended matter collected during comparatively \n\nshorter intervals sampled with the sediment traps (De Stigter et al., in press). For the \n\nlower canyon, at 4402 m WD (252-62), the relatively high contents of lithogenic material \n\nin surface sediments compared to suspended material collected with sediment traps in the \n\nsame area may also result from bioturbation causing the upward mixing of lithogenic-\n\nenriched turbiditic sediment buried at a few centimetres depth below the hemipelagic \n\nsurface layer. \n\nLow-frequency and high-energy processes like gravity flows are also capable of \n\ntransporting considerable amount of sediments further down-canyon. They seem, \n\nhowever, very rare in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. In fact, during the total time of five \n\nyears and six months of BOBO deployments (2002 - 2007) no gravity flows were recorded \n\nin the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nOverall, all collected data suggest that sediments are not transported effectively \n\ndown to the lower canyon and rather accumulate in the upper canyon. The only evidence \n\nof relatively recent mass sediment transport from shallower areas to the lower canyon is a \n\nturbiditic sand layer, rich in quartz and mica, encountered below superficial mud in the \n\nlower Set\u00fabal Canyon (225-07, 4445 m WD). According to 210Pb geochronology it seems, \n\nhowever, to be related with the Lisbon 1755 earthquake (De Stigter et al., in press). \n\nRepresenting the most recent recognisable event of mass transport, it shows that only \n\npowerful events like a major earthquake are capable of triggering sediment transport \n\ndown to such water depths. \n\n \n\n6.7.2.  Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon vs. Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (and others) \n\nDespite of its proximity to the coast and to an important river, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon appears to be characterised by sediment accumulation rates (SAR) and mass \n\ndeposition flux (MDF) one or two orders of magnitude lower than the relatively nearby \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 178 \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon (Figure 6.15) (De Stigter et al., 2007b). SPM horizontal net fluxes \n\nestimated through the BOBO lander were also consistently higher in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n(De Stigter et al., 2007b) for comparable water depths (5600 and 1200 g m-2 d-1 at 343 \n\nand 3010 m WD, respectively; cf. Table 6.1); however, around ~4300 m negligible net \n\nSPM transport was inferred for both canyons. In terms of SARs the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nseems to be more similar instead to other canyons located at far distances from the main \n\nsediment source (e.g. Bari Canyon - Turchetto et al., 2007). In accordance, the Cascais \n\nCanyon which has its multiple heads at the shelfbreak (~175 m WD) has comparable \n\nSARs to the former canyon (Figure 6.4). \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\n100.0\n\n1000.0\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nS\nA\n\nR\n a\n\nnd\n M\n\nD\nF \n\n(g\n m\n\n-2\n d\n\n-1\n)\n\n \n \n\nFigure 6.15. Sediment accumulation rates (SAR) measured in the seabed based on 210Pb geochronology and \nmass deposition flux (MDF) measured in sediment traps, plotted against water depth in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \nCanyon, Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b) and Bari Canyon (Turchetto et al., 2007). Note the change \nof y-scale from Figure 6.4. \n\n \n\nIt is generally accepted that sediment entering the canyon head from fluvial and/or \n\nalong-shelf/open slope transport sources accumulates in a sediment pile in the upper \n\ncanyon over time, producing a temporary sediment reservoir (Mastbergen &amp; Van den \n\nBerg, 2003). Failure of this sediment deposit, which may occur due to a number of \n\nprocesses, results in low frequency, high-energy, sediment gravity flows rather than \n\ncontinuous sedimentation (Arzola et al., 2008). According to observations by De Stigter et \n\nal. (2007b) in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, internal tides are a major force behind fine-grained \n\nsuspended sediment transport from the canyon head to the middle canyon (2700 \u2013 \n\n4000 m WD), whereas intermittent gravity flows are responsible for down-canyon \n\ntransport from the middle canyon to the lower canyon occurring on a yearly or longer \n\ntimescales. As referred above already, in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon no gravity flow was \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 179\n\nrecorded during the total time of five years and six months of deployments while for a \n\nsimilar period of time at least three important mass flux events were recorded in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon. This might suggest that gravity flows in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon are \n\nnot as common as in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, and therefore play a minor role in transporting \n\nsediment to the middle and lower Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nSurface sediments of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon show lithogenic contents consistently above \n\n80 % down to depths around 5000 m WD (Figure 6.16), and kaolinite contents higher \n\nthan 30 % and Feld/Phy ratios > 0.2 throughout the canyon, indicating effective transport \n\nof coastal sediments down to the lower canyon, in accordance with the hydrodynamic \n\ndata. In the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons such mineralogical characteristics only \n\noccur in the upper reaches of the canyons close to the canyon head (Figure 6.16). \n\nEfficiency of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon in transporting sediments down to the lower canyon \n\nis also reflected in the supply of fresh organic matter to deeper ecosystems (Figure 6.17). \n\nGarc\u00eda et al. (2010) compared organic matter content and its bioavailability in both the \n\nNazar\u00e9 and the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons and concluded that while in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon there are no major differences in Corg contents between the canyon and the \n\nadjacent slope, contents are considerably higher in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon compared to the \n\nadjacent slope. As shown in Figure 6.17 these differences can also be noticed in the data \n\nhere presented. Garc\u00eda et al. (2010) found, however, that quality of organic matter in \n\nboth regions is similar for equivalent depths in the canyon and on the slope, which may \n\nbe interpreted as an indication that lateral transport through the canyons occurs on a time \n\nscale that is too long to preserve the freshness of the organic material. \n\nEven so, the fact that sediment accumulation rates determined for the axis of the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons are consistently higher than SARs determined for the \n\ncanyon walls and edges and for the Sines and Estremadura open slopes indicates that, for \n\nthis area of the Portuguese margin, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and the Cascais Canyon \n\nact as important depocentres of sediments. This relative importance of canyons as \n\ndepocentres or geomorphological traps of sediments compared to the surrounding slope \n\nenvironments was already demonstrated for other submarine canyons: e.g. for the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon (Portuguese margin), Schmidt et al. (2001), Van Weering et al. (2002) and De \n\nStigter et al. (2007b); for the Bari Canyon (Adriatic Sea), Turchetto et al. (2007); for the \n\nFoix Canyon (Catalonia margin), Sanchez-Cabeza et al. (1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 180 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16.

Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 182 \n\n6.7.3. Open slope of the central Portuguese continental margin \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, Cascais and Nazar\u00e9 canyons act as natural boundaries dividing \n\nthe central Portuguese margin in different sections of shelf and slope, here referred to as \n\nthe Mondego, Estremadura, Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Sines shelf and slope, each with its \n\nspecific pattern of sediment distribution.  \n\nFrom the three studied open slope areas (Mondego, Estremadura and Sines), the \n\nSines open slope stands out for its higher SARs and higher contents of non-carbonate \n\nterrigenous materials (around 70 %) comparing equivalent water depths, while the \n\nEstremadura shows the lowest SARs and contents of non-carbonate terrigenous materials \n\n(around 60 %). The Mondego open slope has intermediate features regarding the above \n\nparameters being nonetheless the closest transect to a main river - Mondego River \n\n(Figures 6.4 and 6.6e, f, h). The differences between the Sines and Estremadura areas \n\ncan be related to the following: \n\n1) several studies (e.g. Ortiz &amp; Mix, 1992; Thunell &amp; Sautter, 1992) clearly show that \n\nmaximum fluxes of planktonic foraminifera occur when upwelling is more intense. \n\nSalgueiro et al. (2008) show lower mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) between 1985 \n\nand 2003 during summer time in the Estremadura margin compared with the SSTs from \n\nSines margin (see Figure 2.11 on pg. 36 of Chapter 2). This suggests more intense \n\nupwelling occurring around the northern area. According to these same authors, higher \n\nplanktonic foraminifera abundance occurs in the Estremadura margin, associated with the \n\nCape Roca. This fact does explain higher CaCO3 contents in the northern open slope but \n\ndoes not explain however higher SARs measured in the Sines open slope; \n\n2) the progressive deposition of suspended fine-grained terrigenous material along \n\nentrained with the MOW along the Portuguese continental slope (Grousset et al., 1988) \n\nmust be higher in the Sines area than in the Estremadura area. This subject will be \n\nfurther discussed below. \n\n  \n\nThe imprint of the Mediterranean Outerflow Water \n\nThe high distance from terrigenous sediment supply and winnowing of sediments on \n\nthe upper slope can help to lower SAR and concentrate CaCO3 contained in foram shells in \n\nthe Estremadura open slope. The concentration of CaCO3 may be also partially explained \n\nby relatively higher productivity of foraminifera in the Estremadura slope. Since no \n\nimportant rivers debouch on the coast facing the Sines open slope, it is contrary to \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 183\n\nexpectations that sediment accumulation rates and contents of lithogenic material are \n\nfound to be higher on the Sines open slope than on the Estremadura and Mondego open \n\nslopes. Deposition of sediments entrained with the MOW may help explaining these higher \n\nSARs and associated higher contents of lithogenic material on the Sines open slope. \n\nAccording to McCave &amp; Hall (2002), the strong density gradients at the boundaries of \n\nthe MOW favour internal wave activity and sediment resuspension. Suspended particles \n\non the upper slope may be carried along with the poleward flowing MOW, forming a wide \n\nand permanent intermediate nepheloid layer over the upper slope, as observed on the \n\nGalician slope by McCave &amp; Hall (2002). Moreover, as observed in south-western Gulf of \n\nCadiz, settling of suspended sediment from the MOW may also be found in areas where \n\nthe MOW flows detached from the seafloor, giving rise to the formation of hemipelagites. \n\n \n\nAlong-margin perspective \n\nThe Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) was clearly recognised in hydrographic \n\nprofiles across the central Portuguese continental margin, as distinct salinity maximum \n\nbetween 500 and 1500 m WD (De Stigter et al., 2004 and 2007a, Figure 2.10 on pg. 34). \n\nAlong the Portuguese margin this water mass mixes with other less saline and colder \n\nwaters as shown in Figure 2.10. Bower et al. (2002) show that there is a significant \n\namount of mixing of the lower-core MOW around the south-western Iberian Peninsula and \n\nthat a considerable portion of the lower-core water flows into the interior of the ocean \n\nafter crossing the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon as the large-scale orientation of the slope \n\nchanges from north-south to northwest-southeast. \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, Pierce &amp; Stanley (1975) observed that smectite content in SPM \n\nin the MOW is twice as high as in the overlying surface water and two to four times \n\nhigher than in the underlying surface sediments. The source for this smectite is thought \n\nto be the Guadalquivir River (M\u00e9li\u00e8res, 1974; Grousset et al., 1988; Sch\u00f6nfeld, 1997).  \n\nAlthough there are other sources of smectite in the area, the results of the present \n\nstudy show that there is a northward regional decrease of smectite contents, within the \n\ndepth interval affected by the MOW flow. Between 1000 and 1500 m WD smectite \n\ncontents in surface sediments decrease from 3.5 % on the Sines open slope, to 2.7 % on \n\nthe Estremadura slope, to 2.1 % on the Mondego slope. Within the canyons, in the same \n\ndepth interval, smectite contents were between 1.6 and 3.2 %. Grousset et al. (1988) \n\nalso observed this general decrease of smectite contents along the Portuguese margin but \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 184 \n\nthe percentages obtained in this study are not comparable to those reported here as \n\ndifferent methodologies were used to quantify clay minerals. \n\n \n\nAcross-margin perspective \n\nThe across-margin changes in the mineralogy of surface sediments which may be \n\nrelated to the MOW include: \n\n1) Enhanced contents of smectite between 1000 and 1500 m WD (Figure 6.13f); \n\n2) Decrease of kaolinite\u2019s crystallinity between 1000 and 1500 m WD (Figure 6.13e); \n\n3) Conspicuous increase of the carbonate contents around 1500 m WD (Figure 6.6e, \n\nf, h) in the open slope transects. \n\nThe across-margin changes of the clay mineralogy (point 1 and 2) are most \n\nconspicuous in the Sines and Estremadura open slope transects and in the Lisbon and \n\nCascais canyons. The clay mineral signature of MOW seems almost lost or diluted in the \n\nMondego transect and neither is it detected in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, probably due to the \n\nmore active down-canyon transport of sediments through this canyon. The reason why it \n\nis also not detected in the upper Set\u00fabal branch is not clear. It could be due to a change \n\nof the course of the water mass in this area. Many studies have highlighted the important \n\nmodifications that along-slope currents suffer when they encounter a canyon on their \n\npath (e.g. Durrieu de Madron, 1994; Puig et al., 2000; Petrenko, 2003). \n\nSuspended particulate matter of the MOW is not only enriched in smectite but also in \n\nkaolinite (Grousset et al., 1988). This mineral, however, seems not a suitable tracer for \n\nthis water mass because kaolinite enrichment in sediments from the central Portuguese \n\nmargin may also be derived from other sources such as the Tagus and Sado rivers. \n\nHowever, crystallinity index of kaolinite across the open slope transects indicates the \n\noccurrence of more degraded kaolinites between 1000 and 1500 m WD. These kaolinites \n\nseem therefore to have a different and more distant source than those predominating at \n\ndifferent water depths, conceivably transported by the MOW. The occurrence of the \n\nmaximum in smectite contents and kaolinite crystallinity minimum in the 1000-1500 m \n\ndepth interval indicates that SPM carried along the MOW settles in the lower part of the \n\nMOW.   \n\nWinnowing of surface sediments by enhanced currents associated with the MOW \n\nappears to be reflected by grain size distribution patterns across the open slope. Whereas \n\nat water depths below 2000 m surface sediments have relatively uniform grain size \n\nspectra with mode &lt;8 \u00b5m typical for hemipelagic sedimentation (Figure 6.18), sediments \n\n\n\n6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent margin \n\n 185\n\nbetween 500 and 2000 m WD have distinctly coarser modes indicating that pelagic \n\nsedimentation is not the main process affecting surface sediments. On the upper Sines \n\nslope, particle size mode at 500 m WD is coarser than at 1500 m WD (Figure 6.18). The \n\nabove suggests that the fine grained sediment fraction is removed from the slope affected \n\nby the upper MOW and settles near the lower limit of the MOW limit together with \n\nsuspended matter entrained by the MOW from more distant sources. As proposed by \n\nSch\u00f6nfeld (1997) the reason for the enhanced sedimentation in the lower MOW core layer \n\nmay be the rapidly decreasing or highly variable water turbulence at this level. This same \n\nauthor observed the accumulation of pteropod shells around 1500 m WD on the Sines \n\nopen slope which may explain the conspicuous increase of carbonate contents around this \n\ndepth as seen in the three open slope transects (Figure 6.6) and as indicated before in \n\npoint 3. \n\n \n\nSines open slope\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n0.1 1 10 100 1000\nGrain size (\u00b5m)\n\n%\n\n490 m\n1002 m\n1374 m\n2130 m\n2475 m\n2908 m\n3908 m\n4987 m\n\n \nFigure 6.18.

Introduction \n\nContamination of the marine environment with anthropogenic trace metals has \n\nstrongly increased over the last ~150 years as a result of the exponential growth in the \n\nworld\u2019s population and industrial development. In the last few decades this contamination \n\nhas become an issue of international concern, urging for research on the sources, \n\ndispersal pathways, and sites of accumulation of these trace metals. Since trace metals \n\noriginating from human activity usually accumulate in sediments together with trace \n\nmetals from natural sources, it is often difficult to quantify the contribution from the \n\nrespective sources (Soto-Jim\u00e9nez &amp; P\u00e1ez-Osuna, 2001). The problem is amplified by \n\nvariable loadings of trace elements originating from these two sources, as well as the \n\ninteraction of elements with sediment of variable grain size, mineralogy and organic \n\nmatter content (Soto-Jim\u00e9nez &amp; P\u00e1ez-Osuna, 2001). Several granulometric and \n\ngeochemical procedures have been developed to compensate for such influence and to \n\nallow comparisons between samples with different characteristics. Geochemical \n\nprocedures include normalisation in relation to a conservative element such as Al, Fe, Rb, \n\nCs, Sc and Li (e.g. Grant &amp; Middleton, 1990; Loring &amp; Rantala, 1992). \n\nEven then, knowing only the total concentrations and chemical/mineralogical context \n\nof trace metals is not strictly sufficient for a precise evaluation of contamination sources. \n\nIn the present study lead stable isotopes are therefore introduced as \u201cfingerprints\u201d of \n\nenvironmental pollution, because it is the only trace metal pollutant known to exhibit \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 188 \n\nsignificant natural variation in the proportions of its isotopes - 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb \n\n(Dickin, 1995). The isotopic proportions, usually expressed as isotope ratios, display \n\ncharacteristic ranges for different natural Pb ores and are thought to be unaltered by \n\nsmelting and other manufacturing processes (Flegal &amp; Smith, 1995). Therefore, Pb \n\nisotope \u201csignatures\u201d have been increasingly used by environmental scientists as tracers to \n\nputatively identify the different natural and industrial contributions of Pb in humans and \n\nthe environment (Sangster et al., 2000).  \n\nTrace metals enter the ocean from sources located on continents via atmospheric \n\ntransport or riverine input. Like many other contaminants, trace metals are removed from \n\nthe sea water by biological and physico-chemical processes, including scavenging by \n\nsuspended particulate organic matter, to become incorporated into sediments on the \n\nseabed (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 1981; Gibbs, 1986). Most of the contaminants discharged by \n\nrivers, sewers and pipelines are associated with fine-grained particles (Salomons &amp; \n\nF\u00f6rstner, 1984), including organic films, colloidal material or plankton cells (Fisher &amp; \n\nReinfelder, 1995). Thus, the fate of contaminants introduced to the sea is closely \n\nassociated with the transport and deposition of particulate matter (Gibbs, 1973; Puig et \n\nal., 1999). \n\nSubmarine canyons are important transport routes for the transfer of particulate \n\nmatter from the coastal ocean to the deep sea. Although most submarine canyons are \n\npresently sites of sediment accumulation rather than of erosion, some studies show \n\nintermittent mass transport of sediments down canyons continuing to the present-day \n\n(e.g. Xu et al., 2002; Palanques et al., 2005; De Stigter et al., 2007b). For the large \n\nsubmarine canyons of the central Portuguese margin, which are the subject of the \n\npresent study, present-day intermittent down-canyon transport to depths greater than \n\n4000 m has been confirmed for the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b). Results \n\npresented in Chapter 6 indicate that down-canyon transport is less effective in the Lsibon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon, and probably as well in the Cascais Canyon. Mass down-canyon transport \n\nof sediments seems to occur only infrequently in these canyons, triggered by high energy \n\nseismic events. The latter two canyons, located close to densely populated and \n\nindustrialized metropolitan areas and heading close to where the Tagus and Sado rivers \n\ndebouch on the shelf, are likely to intercept riverine sediments and associated trace \n\nmetals. By contrast, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon has no direct connection to a major river system, \n\nand is more remote from point sources of anthropogenic pollutants. \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 189\n\nTrace metal contamination has been documented for the Tagus and Sado estuaries \n\n(e.g. Figu\u00e8res et al., 1985; Quevauviller, 1988; Cortes\u00e3o &amp; Vale, 1995; Gil &amp; Vale, 2001; \n\nCaeiro et al., 2005; Fran\u00e7a et al., 2005; Vale et al., 2008) and to a lesser extent, the \n\nadjacent open shelf (e.g. Jouanneau et al., 1998; Cott\u00e9-Krief et al., 2000; Mil-Homens et \n\nal., 2009; Chapter 5). Little attention has been paid to the nearby canyons and deep slope \n\nenvironments. Even worldwide, studies involving the dispersal of trace metals through \n\ncanyon systems are scarce. \n\nThe main objectives of the present chapter are to assess: \n\n1) the geographic patterns of excess trace metals dispersal in three Portuguese \n\ncanyons (Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, Nazar\u00e9 and Cascais) and open slope; \n\n2) natural and anthropogenic sources of trace metals in the canyons and open slope \n\nof the central Portuguese margin, with especial focus on Pb;  \n\n3) the role of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon in channelling transport of anthropogenic \n\ntrace metals to the deep sea. Data from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon will be used to establish \n\ncomparisons with the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. The Nazar\u00e9 Canyon was studied in more \n\ndetail with regard to the dispersal of Pb by Richter et al. (2009). \n\nThe last objective will be approached through the comparison of enrichment factors \n\nobtained for trap samples and surface sediment cores and by integrating trace metal data \n\nwith observations on near-bottom hydrodynamics and sediment dispersal from the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (Chapter 6) and the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b). \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 190 \n\n7.2. Major, minor and trace element concentrations \n\nIn this section the distribution of eleven elements (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cr, Mn, Ni, \n\nCu and U) in surface sediments and sediment trap samples from the central Portuguese \n\ncanyons and open slope will be evaluated and correlated with other relevant sedimentary \n\nparameters such as grain size, lithogenic content, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and organic \n\ncarbon (Corg) / organic matter. \n\nSubsequently, the enrichment with anthropogenic trace metals will be assessed, first \n\nfor the most recent sediment deposit included in the top 0.5 cm of sediment cores and for \n\nsediment trap samples by using enrichment factors, and then for the last 150 years by \n\nlooking at the relative contribution of excess trace metals to total trace metal inventories. \n\n7.2.1. General characteristics of surface sediments and suspended \n\nparticulate material \n\nSurface sediments in the canyon thalweg and lower part of the walls comprise mostly \n\nhemipelagic clayey silt composed of terrigenous lithogenic material (72 - 87 %), calcium \n\ncarbonate (10 - 25 %) and organic matter (1.4 - 5.0 %) (Figure 7.1a, b). Higher up the \n\nwalls and edges of the canyons, surface sediments show lower concentrations of \n\nlithogenic materials (69 - 78 %) and organic matter (1.4 - 2.8 %) while carbonate \n\ncontents are generally higher (20 - 27 %). True open slope surface sediments have even \n\nlower contents of lithogenic material (39 - 75 %) and organic matter (0.3 - 1.0 %) and \n\nhigher carbonate contents (24 - 60 %). Canyon surface sediments generally have a modal \n\ngrain size between 8 and 50 \u00b5m, while upper slope surface sediments often have modal \n\ngrain size coarser than 50 \u00b5m, and sediments from the middle and lower slope have \n\nmodes finer than 8 \u00b5m. Surface sediments from the walls and edges of the canyons \n\nusually have grain sizes within the range of open slope sediments, but may also have \n\nmodal grain sizes between 8 and 50 \u00b5m. Generally, modal grain sizes decrease with depth \n\ndown the canyons and on the adjacent open slope, but in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon modal grain \n\nsize increases until 4500 m WD (Chapter 6, Figure 6.5 on pg. 152). \n\nSuspended particulate matter collected in sediment traps along the canyon axes \n\nconsists of clayey silt with minor coarse material (sand-sized particles never exceed 6 % \n\nof the total content). In general, carbonate contents increase with depth down-canyon, \n\nprobably reflecting a reduction of lithogenic input. Contents of organic material are higher \n\n\n\n7.

Major elements Ca, Fe, Al and minor element Mn \n\nWith regard to major elements, the regional distribution of Ca closely matches the \n\ndistribution of CaCO3, with lower contents in canyons (especially in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon) \n\nand higher values on open slopes (Figure 7.2a). Concentrations of Al tend to be higher in \n\ncanyons than on true open slopes (Table 7.1, Figure 7.2b). On the other hand, Fe shows \n\nmore or less uniform mean concentrations for all environments (Table 7.1). Neither in \n\ncanyons or open slopes are consistent trends with water depth observed for Ca, Fe and Al \n\ncontents in surface sediments and trap samples, except that Ca has higher concentrations \n\nin trap samples from the lower canyons. \n\nNo major differences are found between contents of Mn in canyons and open slopes \n\nat comparable water depths (Figure 7.2d). Concentrations generally increase with \n\nincreasing water depth both in canyons and slopes, but a conspicuous maximum is \n\nobserved in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon just down-slope from where the upper canyon \n\nbranches merge. \n\n\n\n7.

Selection of a normaliser for calculating enrichment factors \n\nTemporal or spatial variation in trace metal distribution may to some extent be \n\nrelated to variation in supply of major sediment components with which the trace metals \n\nare associated. To compensate for this effect, normalisation is often applied relative to a \n\nproxy of the most important carrier. Correlations between trace metal and carrier proxies \n\nmay help in identifying the most suitable carrier proxy to be used as normaliser. Among \n\nvarious proxies for potential trace metal carriers, such as Al and Fe for terrigenous \n\naluminosilicates, Ca and CaCO3 for pelagic skeletal carbonate, and Corg for organic matter, \n\nFe and Al showed the largest number of significant positive correlations with trace metals, \n\nsuggesting that terrigenous aluminosilicates are the dominant trace metal carriers in the \n\nstudy area. Spearman correlations calculated for all surface sediment samples (Table 7.2) \n\nfrom all the studied canyons and open slopes show positive correlation of Fe with Cr \n\n(0.78), Cu (0.57), Pb (0.40), Ni and Zn (0.33). Correlations between Al and trace metals \n\nare less strong than for Fe. Organic carbon is only correlated to Pb (0.44) while CaCO3 \n\nhas no positive correlation with any trace metal. Modal grain size only correlates positively \n\nwith Zn (0.46) and negatively with Cu (-0.51). In general, the correlations between trace \n\nmetals and trace metal carrier proxies do not seem to be strong when using the whole \n\ndataset of surface sediments. This is most conceivably because differences in \n\nanthropogenic trace metal input to different areas lead to variable trace metal/trace metal \n\ncarrier ratios, disturbing the natural correlation between both. Correlations were therefore \n\ncalculated separately for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon systems as shown in \n\nTables 7.3 and 7.4, making further distinction between surface sediment and trap \n\nsamples. Indeed these subsets of data yield more significant correlations than the entire \n\ndataset, but since the results do not differ much in qualitative sense they will not be \n\ndiscussed here for the separate datasets. \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

However, according to our \n\nCorg/N ratios (Chapter 6, Figure 6.9 on pg. 157), the Corg in the canyon comprises a \n\nvariable mixture of marine and laterally advected terrigenous organic matter. On the \n\nadjacent slope the Corg is predominantly of marine origin. Apart from that, there are \n\ndifferences in degradation state when comparing sediment trap material and surface or \n\ndeep sediments (Figure 7.1a) which makes the use of Corg as normaliser problematic. \n\nSince analytical results showed a better accuracy for Fe than for Al, and Fe showed \n\nthe strongest correlations to trace metals, Fe was chosen for the normalisation of trace \n\nmetals. Normalisation for Al yielded very similar results, albeit more scattered than for Fe, \n\nconceivably because of the lower accuracy of Al analyses. We found no indication in our \n\ndata that secondary diagenetic enrichment of trace metals played a significant role. The \n\nfew cores displaying distinct surface enrichment of Fe and Mn (225-22, 204-56, 236-14, \n\n236-20 for Fe and 236-52, 204-33 for Mn) showed no corresponding enrichment in trace \n\nmetals. \n\n \n\n7.2.5.

In almost all analysed samples Ni exceeded the ERL, yet Long et al. (1995) \n\nargue that sediment guidelines for Ni have low accuracy. \n\nIn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, Cascais and Nazar\u00e9 canyons all analysed trace metals reached \n\nconcentrations above the ERL in one or more samples. There are samples with \n\nconcentrations of Pb above the ERL especially in the upper reaches of the canyons. \n\nCopper and Cr showed concentrations above the ERL in the walls of the canyons and in \n\nthe lower canyons. For Zn the Cascais Canyon is highlighted since all samples collected \n\nhad concentrations above the ERL. \n\nOn the Sines open slope, Cr, Cu and Zn showed contents exceeding the ERL in all \n\nsamples from below 1000 m WD while Pb had no samples above the ERL. On the \n\nEstremadura open slope there were no samples with contents of Pb and Cr higher than \n\nthe ERL. For Cu and Zn two samples of the four collected in this area had concentrations \n\nabove the ERL. \n\nAssessment of trace metal distribution by reference to NOAA guidelines highlights \n\nsamples from all study areas with enhanced trace metal contents. In the southern \n\ncanyons higher concentrations of trace metals were mainly encountered in surface \n\nsediments from the upper reaches of the canyons. In the northern area enhanced \n\nconcentrations of all the considered trace metals were mostly found in sediment trap \n\nsamples from the lower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\nInterpretations based on sediment quality guidelines must be treated with due \n\ncaution since they do not take regional biotic and environmental variability into account \n\nnor the specific sediment composition. In the present study they are presented just as a \n\npreliminary step for the evaluation of trace metal dispersion. \n\n  \n\n7.2.6. Present-day trace metal enrichment \n\n \n\nLead and Zinc \n\nIn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons all surface sediment samples show EF \n\n(Pb) higher than 1.0 (Figure 7.4a). Highest EF (Pb) values above 2.5 are found in the \n\nupper reaches of these canyons, whereas EF values generally decrease further down-\n\ncanyon. The lowest values (EF &lt;1.5) correspond to two samples collected on the open \n\nslope (225-02 and 225-20, EF = 1.4) and one in the lower part of the canyon (225-07, EF \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 200 \n\n= 1.3). Zinc enrichment has a largely comparable distribution as Pb though generally with \n\nlower EF values (Figure 7.4a, b). EF (Zn) values above 1.5 occurred only in the Lisbon \n\nCanyon. Both Pb and Zn showed highest enrichments in the Lisbon Canyon, followed by \n\nCascais and upper Set\u00fabal canyons. \n\nIn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, EF (Pb) has an offshore logarithmic decrease in both \n\ncanyon branches (r2 = 0.60 and 0.57, respectively) while EF (Zn) only shows it for the \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon. Samples collected on the walls and edges of the canyons reveal \n\nconsistently lower EFs than surface samples collected at equivalent water depths along \n\nthe axis of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons. \n\nEFs in surface sediments of the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons are \n\ncomparable to those from surface sediments from the Lisbon outer shelf and upper slope \n\n(Chapter 5, Table 5.5 on pg. 133). EFs in surface sediments of the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, \n\nhowever, are higher than the mean values obtained for the Set\u00fabal and Sines upper \n\nslopes for both Pb and Zn. \n\nIn the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, EF (Pb) and EF (Zn) above 1.5 are only found in the upper \n\nreaches of the canyon, at depths less than 1000 m WD. Lower values are found further \n\ndown the canyon. Canyon surface samples show a slight EF decrease with water depth, \n\nespecially for Pb, whereas open slope values are relatively constant for Zn and do not \n\nshow a consistent pattern with water depth for Pb (Figure 7.4a, b). \n\nEnrichment factors of Pb and Zn are slightly lower on the walls and edges of the \n\ncanyons than on true open slope transects (Sines and Estremadura) (Figure 7.4a, b). \n\nPossibly this reflects dilution with pre-industrial sediment, either by hydrodynamic mixing \n\nor bioturbation. Comparing samples at equivalent water depths, the enrichment factors of \n\nPb and Zn are higher in the Sines transect than for the Estremadura transect. \n\n \n\nCopper \n\nIn contrast with Pb and Zn, Cu enrichment shows a logarithmic increase with water \n\ndepth (r2 = 0.67) in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and the adjacent slope. For the Cascais \n\nCanyon EF (Cu) increases with increasing water depth as well but values are consistently \n\nlower than for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (Figure 7.4c). Surface sediments from the \n\nupper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons have comparable EFs (Cu) to the mean \n\nvalue obtained for the Lisbon outer shelf and upper slope (1.2 each area). Surface \n\nsediments from the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon have also comparable EFs (Cu) to those found \n\non the Set\u00fabal and Sines outer shelves and upper slopes (Table 5.5). \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 201\n\nIn the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, EFs (Cu) in surface sediments are more or less constant both \n\nalong the canyon thalweg and on the adjacent slope. \n\nOn the open slopes, EFs (Cu) are generally higher near the edges of the canyons \n\nthan on true open slope sediments (Figure 7.4c).

Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 202 \n\nChromium and Nickel \n\nWhereas Pb, Zn and Cu are variably enriched throughout the central Portuguese \n\ncanyons and open slope transects there is little if any evidence for surface enrichment of \n\nCr and Ni in any part of the study area (Figure 7.4d, e). \n\nWithin the canyons there are no clear trends in enrichment factors with water depth \n\nfor Cr and Ni, and neither are substantial differences observed in enrichment of these \n\nelements between the canyons, except that EF (Ni) seem higher in the Cascais Canyon \n\ncompared to the other canyons. On the open slopes, no differences are observed in Cr \n\nenrichment, but Ni enrichments seem to be higher in the Sines transect. \n\nEFs of Cr and Ni in sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais \n\ncanyons are comparable to those found in surface sediments from the Lisbon outer \n\nshelf/upper slope, but EF (Ni) values in the Cascais Canyon are considerably higher than \n\nthose found in the upper slope. Surface sediments from the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon have \n\nalso comparable EFs (Cr and Ni) to those found on the Set\u00fabal and Sines outer \n\nshelves/upper slopes (Table 5.5). \n\n \n\n7.2.7. Excess and total metal inventories over the last 150 years \n\nInventories of excess Pb, Zn and Cu in sediments from the canyons range from \n\nvalues comparable to, to values two orders of magnitude higher than the ones recorded \n\nin open slope sediments for equivalent water depth (Figure 7.5, Table 7.5).  \n\nIn general, the contributions of excess Pb, Zn and Cu relative to total inventories \n\ndeposited over the last 150 years decrease with increasing water depth for both canyons \n\nand open slope (Figures 7.6, 7.7, 7.8). The contribution of excess Pb (Pbxs) varies from a \n\nmaximum of 56 and 41 % in the upper Lisbon and Set\u00fabal canyons, respectively, to a \n\nminimum of 6 % in the lower canyon (4402 m WD). In the Cascais Canyon, percentages \n\nvary from 53 to 29 % from 953 to 3900 m WD. Sediments from the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nhave Pbxs percentages between 37 and 42 %, similar to the ones from the upper Set\u00fabal \n\ncanyon (Figure 7.6). In general, percentages of Pbxs are lower in the northern part of the \n\nstudy area, adjacent to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and at the Estremadura transect, than in the \n\nsouthern part, for equivalent water depths. For example, between 2000 and 3000 m WD \n\nthere is ~12 % more Pbxs in the Sines open slope compared to the Estremadura open \n\nslope (Figure 7.6). \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 203\n\n \n\nPercentages of excess Zn (Znxs) are clearly higher in the Lisbon Canyon (51 \u2013 55 %) \n\ncompared to the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon (14 \u2013 20 %). The only core in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nreliable for Zn, located at 941 m WD, has 21 % of Znxs, comparable to the upper Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon values (Figure 7.7, Table 7.5). In the Cascais Canyon a more complete set of Znxs \n\npercentages was obtained for the whole canyon range from 58 % (953 m WD) down to \n\n10 % (3914 m WD). Excess Zn on the open slope transects has considerably lower values \n\nof 15 % (490 m WD) down to 6 % (3900 m WD). Values from the open slopes adjacent \n\nto the canyons span a wide range of 9 \u2013 36 %. \n\nExcess Cu (Cuxs) reaches the highest values on the slope around 1000 m WD, 43 % \n\nin the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal area and 27 % in the Nazar\u00e9 area (Figure 7.8). At equivalent water \n\ndepth in the canyons, lower values of 22 %, 21 %, 17 % and 6 % are found for the \n\nCascais, Lisbon, Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal canyons, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nCanyons Slopes \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nnt\nor\n\nie\ns \n\nof\n P\n\nb\nxs\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\ncm\n-2\n\n)\n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon\n\nCascais Canyon\nFoix Canyon\n\na)  \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nnt\nor\n\nie\ns \n\nof\n P\n\nb\nxs\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\ncm\n-2\n\n)\n\nLisbon-Set. open slope\nNazar\u00e9 open slope\nEstremadura open slope\nSines open slope\nGulf of Lion open slope\nCatalonia open slope\n\n \n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nnt\no\n\nri\nes\n\n o\nf \n\nZn\nxs\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\ncm\n-2\n\n)\n\nb)\n \n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nnt\nor\n\nie\ns \n\nof\n Z\n\nn x\ns \n\n(\u00b5\ng \n\ncm\n-2\n\n)\n\n \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nnt\nor\n\nie\ns \n\nof\n C\n\nu\nxs\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\ncm\n-2\n\n)\n\nc)  \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater depth (m)\n\nIn\nve\n\nn\nto\n\nri\nes\n\n o\nf \n\nC\nu\n\nxs\n (\n\n\u00b5g\n c\n\nm\n-2\n\n)\n\n \n \n\nFigure 7.5.

Distribution patterns of excess trace metal accumulation in \n\nPortuguese canyons and open slopes \n\nContents of major elements Ca, Al and Fe and some trace metals like Cr and Ni in \n\nsurface sediments appear largely similar to contents measured in pre-industrial sediments \n\n(Figures 7.2 and 7.3), meaning that in terms of bulk composition the sediment has not \n\nchanged over the last 150 years. Pre-industrial concentrations of trace metals, Fe and Al  \n\nare largely similar for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon systems (Table 7.1), \n\nwhereas recent surface sediments and suspended particulate matter usually display \n\nhigher concentrations of various trace metals, for some elements appreciably diverging \n\nbetween both areas. Surface sediments and suspended particulate matter in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon have higher mean concentrations of Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr and Ni (and Cu, Fe for \n\nsurface sediments only) compared to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Table 7.1). Regarding only \n\nsurface sediments, the highest mean concentrations for all trace metals are found in the \n\nCascais Canyon.  \n\nPercentages of excess trace metal accumulated over the last 150 years in sediment \n\ndeposits are also higher for the southern canyons, especially the Lisbon and Cascais \n\ncanyons (Table 7.5). This is consistent with the proximity of the Lisbon and Cascais \n\ncanyons to densely populated and industrialised areas, and with sediment input from the \n\nTagus River, a potential major source of particle-bound pollutants.  \n\nThe degree of trace metal enrichment found in sediments from the Lisbon and \n\nCascais canyons is comparable or higher to what has been previously published from \n\nother canyon and slope areas (Figure 7.5), such as the Foix Canyon in the NW \n\nMediterranean (Palanques et al., 2008), the Gulf of Lions continental slope in the NW \n\nMediterranean (Miralles et al., 2006), and the Kaoping Canyon off Taiwan (Hung &amp; Hsu, \n\n2004). \n\nThus, the canyons of the central Portuguese margin represent different degrees of \n\ntrace metal enrichment, with the upper Cascais and Lisbon canyons being the more \n\naffected by trace metal contamination, and the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon the least. This applies not \n\nonly for the most recent sediments but also for sediments deposited over the last 150 \n\nyears. \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 209\n\nOn the other hand, comparing trace metals inventories in canyons and adjacent open \n\nslopes demonstrates that the upper canyons act as trace metal depocentres. Maximum \n\nexcess inventories occur in the upper parts of the canyons between 500 and 1700 m WD \n\n(Figure 7.5 and Table 7.5), which is where trace metal loadings generally are highest and \n\nwhere active sediment depocentres are located (De Stigter et al., 2007b; Oliveira et al., \n\n2007; Arzola et al., 2008). \n\n7.3.2. The Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon: trace metal enrichment and links to \n\nsediment input and transport \n\n \n\nContributions from the Tagus and Sado rivers to the canyon \n\nAs seen above the Lisbon and upper Set\u00fabal canyons are hotspots of Pb and Zn \n\nenrichment relative to the deeper canyon reaches and adjacent open slopes. The Lisbon \n\nand Set\u00fabal Canyon heads are located close to the mouths of the Tagus and Sado rivers, \n\nrespectively, where high trace metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota due to \n\nanthropogenic activities have been reported (e.g. Cott\u00e9-Krief et al., 2000; Caeiro et al., \n\n2005; Fran\u00e7a et al., 2005).  \n\nA gradient of decreasing Pb and Zn enrichment, from the Tagus prodelta (Chapter 5 \n\nand Mil-Homens et al., 2009) to the head of the Lisbon Canyon and then further down, \n\nstrongly suggests that the excess Pb and Zn must be derived from land, with the Tagus \n\nRiver appearing as the most important local source. This is supported by observations by \n\nJouanneau et al. (1998), who noted a southward gradient in intensity of bottom nepheloid \n\nlayers on part of the Lisbon shelf, and in Pb and Zn concentrations in the underlying \n\nseabed sediments, from the Tagus River mouth to close the head of Lisbon Canyon. Much \n\nless sediment and associated trace metals appear to be transferred from the Sado River \n\ninto the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon, judging from the consistently lower enrichment of Pb and \n\nZn in the latter canyon, as compared to the Lisbon Canyon, despite the fact that also the \n\nSado Estuary is enriched in Pb and Zn. The less effective transfer may be explained by the \n\nmuch lower discharge of the Sado River and the greater distance between the river \n\nmouth and the canyon head. \n\nCopper on the other hand shows signs of enrichment (EF > 1.5) especially in the \n\ndeeper parts (> 2000 m WD) of both canyons and open slopes. Whereas Pb and Zn \n\ndispersal thus seem to be largely explained by terrigenous sediment transport from river \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 210 \n\nto canyon, a different mechanism may be involved in the dispersal of Cu. Although the \n\nsignificant correlation between Cu and Fe suggests that Cu is partly associated with \n\nterrigenous sediment, normalisation for Fe reveals another trend of increasing Cu \n\nenrichment with increasing water depth. Calcium seems to be involved in this other \n\nmechanism of Cu dispersal, in view of the positive correlation of EF (Cu) with Ca (r2 = \n\n0.73) in sediment trap samples from deep parts of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon which are \n\nless affected by resuspention (Figure 7.9). In different marine environments worldwide \n\nthe distribution of Cu has been shown to correlate with major nutrients (Bruland, 1983) \n\nespecially caused by coupled cycling of those nutrients mediated by assimilation and \n\nrecycling by plankton (e.g. Bruland et al., 1991; L\u00f6scher, 1999). In agreement with this, \n\nCaetano &amp; Vale (2003) studying the composition of seston and plankton from the mouth \n\nof major estuarine systems in Portugal concluded that Cu accumulation in phytoplankton \n\nis the dominant process determining the distribution of this element in Portuguese coastal \n\nwaters. \n\n \n\nR2 = 0.40\n\nR2 = 0.73\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\nEF(Cu)\n\nC\na \n\n(%\n)\n\n \nFigure 7.9. Concentration of Ca against EF (Cu) in sediment trap samples from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. \nBlue symbols represent samples from shallower deployments (269-02, 252-34, 204-23, 218-36) where lateral \nsupply of resuspended sediment is thought to dominate sedimentation, and red symbols represent samples \nfrom deeper sites (225-03, 204-35 and 252-62) where pelagic sedimentation is thought to prevail. The blue \nline represents the regression using all samples and the red line the regression using only the trap samples \nfrom deeper deployments. \n\n \n\nSediment transport along the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nOn secular timescale, in the lower Set\u00fabal Canyon, the contribution of excess Pb on \n\nthe total accumulation of Pb (natural and anthropogenic) over the last 150 years is \n\nconspicuously low, and of the same order as the % Pbxs calculated for equivalent depth \n\non the Sines open slope (respectively 6 % and 10 %). This provides further confirmation \n\nthat down-canyon transport of sediments and associated trace metals is not important in \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. As observed previously, the most recent event of mass \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 211\n\ntransport to the lower canyon, represented by a sandy turbidite layer, dates from before \n\nthe start of the industrial era. In comparison to the low % Pbxs in the lower Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon and Sines slope, the 29 % of Pbxs calculated for the lower Cascais Canyon \n\nappears quite high, and may indicate more efficient transport through the latter canyon, \n\nor in general a higher fallout of Pb due to greater proximity to land. \n\nOn a decadal timescale, the logarithmic decrease of Pb and Zn EFs and increase of \n\nEF (Cu) in surface sediments down the course of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon indicate the \n\ninefficient down-canyon transport of sediments from the upper to the lower canyon. The \n\ngeographic patterns of Cu, Pb and Zn enrichment indicate that most of the particulate \n\nmatter coming from the coastal area and/or adjacent shelf is trapped in the upper \n\ncanyons. In the lower canyon, lower and less variable EFs imply a change in the \n\nsedimentary setting, with reduced terrigenous input and increasing relative importance of \n\npelagic settling as a source of sediments. In agreement, Mn concentrations in surface \n\nsediments from the canyon and open slope show a slow increase with water depth until \n\naround 2000 m where a conspicuous increase appears in the surface sediments from the \n\ncanyon (Figure 7.2d). High contents of Mn in surface sediments are related to high \n\noxidised states of seabed sediments caused by low sediment accumulation rates and low \n\norganic matter fluxes (Miller &amp; Orbock, 2007). \n\nAccording to the here presented geochemical data, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon thus \n\nseems to be characterised by limited down-canyon transport of sediments, and the \n\nsystem appears to be rather accumulating sediments and associated trace metals in the \n\nupper canyon. This is in accordance with data presented in Chapter 6 which show that, \n\nfor this canyon, processes of down-canyon transport are not common on a decadal \n\ntimescale. Down-canyon transport of trace metals to the lower canyon seems certainly \n\nmore effective in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon due to its more active mechanisms of down-canyon \n\nsediment transport by sediment gravity flows (De Stigter et al., 2007b). In fact, the \n\nenrichment of Pb and Zn in surface sediments from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon show a somewhat \n\nlinear down-canyon decrease. This is in accordance with sedimentary material derived \n\nfrom the near-shore zone being trapped in the upper canyon and then being effectively \n\ntransported down-canyon with increasing dilution by old sediments with pre-industrial \n\ntrace metal concentrations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 212 \n\nDischarges of contaminated sediments in the Lisbon Canyon \n\nRecent information from the APL (Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Porto de Lisboa \u2013 Administration \n\nof the Harbour of Lisbon) shows that 8000 m3 and 7500 m3 of contaminated sediments \n\ndredged from the Tagus Estuary were discharged in the Lisbon Canyon in 2005 and 2007, \n\nrespectively (Nemus, 2011). The area used has a radius of 200 m and central point at \n\nLongitude 09\u00ba 19\u2019 W and Latitude 38\u00ba 29\u2019 N (ED50) at around 400 m of water depth \n\n(Figure 6.14). According to the APL this same area has been used by other institutions for \n\ndischarge of sediments (e.g. military institutions which also dredge the estuary). \n\nSediments discharged by APL in this area were classified, according to the \n\nPortuguese law (Portaria n\u00ba1450/2007, de 12 de Novembro), as \u201cmoderately \n\ncontaminated\u201d (class 3). Table 7.6 shows the range of concentrations for different \n\nparameters in class 3. \n\n \n\nTable 7.6. Concentrations of trace metals (\u00b5g g-1) and organic compounds (\u00b5g kg-1) in sediment \nclassified as class 3 (moderately contaminated) according to the Portuguese law (Portaria \nn\u00ba1450/2007 de 12 de Novembro). \n\nParameters \nRange of \n\nconcentrations \nParameters \n\nRange of \nconcentrations \n\nAs 50 - 100 Ni 75 \u2013 125 \nCd 3 - 5 Zn 600 \u2013 1500 \nCr 100 \u2013 400 PCB 25 \u2013 100 \nCu 150 \u2013 300 PAH 2000 \u2013 6000 \nHg 1.5 \u2013 3.0 HCB 2.5 - 10 \nPb 150 - 500 - - \n\n \n\nThe following is an exercise attempting to compare the input of anthropogenic trace \n\nmetals from these sediment dumpings to the total annual input of anthropogenic trace \n\nmetals in the Lisbon Canyon thalweg. Taking 38 km as the length of the canyon (Lastras \n\net al., 2009) and 1 km as maximum width of the thalweg, and average sediment \n\naccumulation in the thalweg as around 8.75 g m-2 d-1 (Chapter 6, section 6.3, pg. 143) \n\nwith ~35 ug g-1 anthropogenic Pb content (sections 7.2.3 and 7.2.6) yields a deposition of \n\n4.2 x 106 g of anthropogenic Pb per year. Known discharges of 2005 and 2007, together \n\n15500 m3 with average dry bulk density of 1000 kg m-3, and considering a class 3 Pb \n\ncontamination of 300 \u00b5g g-1 yields a total input of 4.7 x 106 g of dumped Pb. Spread out \n\nevenly over the Lisbon Canyon thalweg this means that the discharges represent 1.1 \n\ntimes the present-day annual deposition of anthropogenic Pb in the Lisbon Canyon \n\nthalweg. That is assuming that the surface enrichment of Pb found in the Lisbon Canyon \n\nitself is not the result of sediment dumping. \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 213\n\nConcentrations of trace metals found in the Lisbon Canyon at sampling locations \n\nrelatively close to the discharge area (surface sediment and sediment trap samples from \n\nsite 252-34, collected in 2007) only approached class 3 level reported in Table 7.6 for Zn. \n\nThe other analysed trace metals had lower concentrations (Figure 7.3). In addition, \n\nsediments collected in the same area in 2003 (Costa et al., 2011) had concentrations of \n\nPb, Cu, Cr and Ni comparable to those reported in the present study, implying that the \n\nmentioned discharges did not introduce considerable concentrations of these trace metals \n\nin the system. Only concentrations of Zn were effectively higher in sediments collected in \n\n2007 compared to those collected in 2003 for similar water depths (1198 vs. 197 \u00b5g g-1, \n\nrespectively). This increase may indeed be related to the discharge of contaminated \n\nsediments into the Lisbon Canyon between 2005 and 2007. The exercise shown above \n\nabout contributions of Pb in the Lisbon Canyon by the mentioned discharges is most \n\ncertainly an overestimation as surface sediment concentrations of Pb did not increase \n\nbetween 2003 and 2007. However, it is possible that other discharges of Pb-contaminated \n\nsediments had already occurred in the canyon before 2003, before the collection of \n\nsamples analysed by Costa et al. (2011).  \n\nThe above exercise, even if very rough, implies that present-day trace metal \n\nconcentrations in surface sediments in the upper Lisbon Canyon may not only originate \n\nfrom outflow from the Tagus Estuary and resuspension of sediments from the shelf, but \n\nmay include a considerable contribution from dumping of moderately contaminated \n\ndredged sediments in the area. This subject certainly needs further investigation as to \n\nwhat concerns the type and level of contamination in the discharged sediments and the \n\nfrequency and location of these discharges by other entities than the APL. \n\n    \n\n7.3.3. Atmospheric lead fallout recorded in Portuguese canyons and \n\nopen slopes  \n\nMarine sediments are assumed to provide good records of atmospheric pollution \n\n(Miralles et al., 2006). The sampling transects on the Estremadura and Sines open slope \n\nand sediment traps deployed in the lower reaches of the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon (218-55 and 252-62, respectively, located 104 \u00b1 2 km from the nearest shoreline) \n\ncan be assumed to have only limited influence from rivers. In accordance, surface \n\nsediments from the open slopes and trap samples from the lower canyon sites show high \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 214 \n\ncontents of calcium carbonate (Figure 7.1b). Corg/N ratios for the trap and surface \n\nsediments are between 6.9 and 8.5 (Chapter 6) which is indicative for organic matter of \n\npredominantly marine origin. In addition, the 206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio of these traps \n\nsamples falls in the range of that determined for regional surface waters (Richter et al., \n\n2009). Therefore, one may assume that trace metal fluxes determined from mix samples \n\nfrom open slope sediment cores (core interval where 210Pb excess activity was still \n\ndetectable) and from sediment traps, both collected in deep areas where pelagic \n\nsedimentation dominates, represent mainly atmospheric fluxes of trace metals over the \n\nlast 150 years and at the present-day, respectively. \n\nComparison between the open slope transects shows consistently higher contents of \n\nPbxs in the Sines transect but no clear patterns for Znxs and Cuxs (Figures 7.6, 7.7, 7.8). \n\nSediment cores collected between 2000 and 3000 m WD contain ~12 % higher mean Pbxs \n\nin the Sines transect (Figure 7.6). The deployments done in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons around 4402 and 4975 m WD, respectively, yielded average values of \n\nexcess Pb flux of 0.54 and 0.35 \u00b5g cm-2 yr-1, respectively, representing 48 and 36 % of \n\nthe total fluxes of Pb at these sites. Interestingly, the difference in anthropogenic \n\ncontribution between both areas is again 12 %. It seems therefore that atmospheric Pb \n\ninput in both areas was not only different in terms of cumulative flux over the past 150 \n\nyears, including the interval when leaded gasoline was in use, but also in terms of \n\npresent-day flux. In fact, after the complete ban on gasoline lead additives (as late as \n\n1999 in Portugal, Roma-Torres et al., 2007) one may presently notice the influence from \n\nvarious industrial activities as sources of Pb, as will be further discussed in the next \n\nsection. \n\nOur results are consistent with prevailing wind directions and more abundant point \n\nsources of anthropogenic Pb in the southern part of the study area. Over the second half \n\nof the last century, input from gasoline lead additives were certainly higher in the \n\nsouthern area since it is closer to major cities like Lisbon and Set\u00fabal. In addition, \n\natmospheric pollution produced in these cities is unlikely to be transported northwards \n\nsince prevailing regional winds blow from N and NW directions (Freire, 1986; Gomes, \n\n1992). Even closer to the Sines transect a major industrial agglomeration, which is the \n\nlargest of the entire Iberian Peninsula, is located in the vicinity of Sines. This industrial \n\narea includes several companies, some operating since the late seventies, which \n\nrepresent potential sources of Pb to the environment, namely: Carbogal (produces raw \n\nmaterial for tyres); Ibera (production of concrete); Kimaxtra (production of cement); \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 215\n\nMetalsines (production and handling of metals); Petrogal (oil refinery); Recipneu \n\n(recycling of tyres) and Repsol pol\u00edmeros e Repsol (petrochemistry plant). \n\nThe higher level of atmospheric pollution in the Sines area is confirmed by a study of \n\nbiomonitors in northern, central and southern Portuguese cities by Baptista et al. (2008) \n\nwhich showed higher accumulations of Pb in biomonitors from Sines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 216 \n\n7.4. Lead stable isotopes (206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb) \n\n7.4.1. Isotopic evidence for natural and anthropogenic sources of Pb \n\n \n\nEstimated isotopic end members \n\nThe entire dataset, obtained for sediment trap and surface sediment samples from \n\nthe central Portuguese margin, predominately suggests binary mixing between one \n\ncomponent with high [Pb] and low 206Pb/207Pb and a second one with low [Pb] and high \n206Pb/207Pb (Figure 7.10a). These are interpreted to represent anthropogenic pollutant and \n\nnatural sources of lead, respectively. In such a situation, the isotopic composition of the \n\npollutant end member can be estimated from the x-axis intercept on a plot vs. the inverse \n\nof the Pb concentration (Figure 7.10b). This yields 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.143 (1.134 \u2013 \n\n1.149 at 95 % confidence interval) for the entire dataset or 1.150 (1.141 \u2013 1.155) if \n\nsamples from the two deepwater traps are excluded from the regression analysis. \n\nConversely, the possible 206Pb/207Pb ratio of the natural end member can be constrained \n\nfrom the x-axis intercept on the isotopic ratio vs. concentration plot of 1.232 (1.226 \u2013 \n\n1.240) or 1.228 (1.222 \u2013 1.235). This represents an upper limit, because by definition the \n\nintercept at 0 \u00b5g g-1 Pb extrapolates beyond the isotopic signature of the actual end \n\nmember with an unconstrained but non-zero Pb concentration. \n\nLead concentrations display an obvious, albeit slightly scattered, relationship with the \n206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio (Figure 7.10a). Only one data point from sediment trap site 236-\n\n07 in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (1126 m WD) had a distinctly higher Pb concentration \n\ncompared to the remainder of the dataset (169 \u00b5g g-1 vs. 24 - 64 \u00b5g g-1 for the other 112 \n\nsamples) and was omitted for calculation of regression lines. This point could be \n\nconsidered as an outlier, although it was replicated by duplicate analysis and this trap site \n\nwas generally characterised by highly variable Pb isotopic ratios and concentrations (cf. \n\nFigure 7.14b and Figure 7.3a, respectively). \n\nFurther deviations from the overall relationship between Pb concentrations and stable \n\nisotope ratios are partly systematic; i.e. points from individuals sites fall in distinct parts of \n\nthe diagram. Notably, most trap samples from the lower Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\ncanyons (stations 225-22/4975 m, 218-55/4298 m and 252-62/4402 m WD) plot below \n\nthe overall regression line, i.e. display a relatively low 206Pb/207Pb ratio for a given \n\n\n\n7.

As data on Portuguese pollutant lead are unfortunately not \n\navailable, we assume that isotopic signatures from other western European countries are \n\nbroadly representative for the area of the present study. Cumulatively, the well-defined \n\noverall linear regression through most data points indicates that binary mixing between \n\ntwo end members as outlined above can explain most of the Pb isotopic variability \n\nobserved in the present study. End members might obviously be \u201cmixed\u201d, themselves \n\nreflecting mixing of several sources, or slightly variable along the canyon axes (cf. above) \n\nor between sediment trap and core top samples (see below). More complex scenarios \n\nwith additional \u201cintermediate\u201d sources along the mixing line also cannot be ruled out. \n\n\n\n7.

Their Pb isotopic \n\ncomposition represents an average signature of industrial lead, as it is derived from \n\nmixing and burning of a wide range of Pb-containing products (Monna et al., 1997). It is \n\nremarkably constant both for different European locations and different sampling sites \n\n(D\u00f6ring et al., 1997; Monna et al., 1997; Deboudt et al., 1999; Hansmann &amp; K\u00f6ppel, \n\n2000) and also close to the average Pb isotopic ratio of all main worldwide Pb ores \n\n(Sangster et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.11.

Data sources: Broken \nHill ore (Sangster et al., 2000), European leaded petrol (Monna et al., 1997; Hansmann &amp; K\u00f6ppel, 2000), \nSpanish aerosols (Bollh\u00f6fer &amp; Rosman, 2001), Incinerator fly ashes (D\u00f6ring et al., 1997; Monna et al., 1997; \nDeboudt et al., 1999; Hansmann &amp; K\u00f6ppel, 2000), S Iberian pyrite belt (Santos Zalduegui et al., 2004 \n[average values for four sample populations]), other Spanish ores (Sangster et al., 2000), Saharan dust \n(Grousset et al., 1994, 1995; Abouchami &amp; Zabel, 2003), Upper continental crust (Millot et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, leaded gasoline was gradually phased out in the early 1990s but \n\ncompletely eliminated only in 1999 (Roma-Torres et al., 2007). Some surface sediment \n\nsamples of the present study integrate Pb input over the last ~10 years (prior to sampling \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 219\n\nin 2002-2007); their Pb isotopic ratios may thus still be affected by this time-transient \n\nchange in pollutant sources (cf. Grousset et al., 1994). Available data (Monna et al., 1997; \n\nHansmann &amp; K\u00f6ppel, 2000) indicate that western European leaded gasoline has \n\ncomparatively unradiogenic (not produced by radioactive decay) Pb isotopic signatures, \n\nreflecting mixing between Australian Broken Hill ore (Sangster et al., 2000) and other Pb \n\nores for production of gasoline lead additives. Considering the 95 % confidence interval \n\nfor 206Pb/207Pb of the pollutant end members, some ongoing contribution from this source \n\ncannot be ruled out. Yet its current influence appears at most minor, and considerably \n\nreduced with respect to the late 20th century Spanish urban aerosols (Bollh\u00f6fer &amp; Rosman, \n\n2001). \n\nFour samples from the lower part of Lisbon Canyon piston-core 204-31 (142 \u2013 \n\n172 cm core depth) have more radiogenic lead isotopic signatures than all present-day \n\nsamples and Pb concentrations of 14.3 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5g g-1, which falls in the range of average \n\ncontinental crust (12 \u2013 17 \u00b5g g-1, Wedepohl, 1995). Planktonic foraminifera from an \n\noverlying sample (134 cm) were AMS 14C-dated to 1410 \u00b1 50 yrs., corresponding to \n\n~1000 AD on a calendar age scale. Several previous studies provided evidence for \n\ncontinuous input of anthropogenic Pb since Greek and Roman times, after ~2000 BC (e.g. \n\nShotyk et al., 1998; Kylander et al., 2005). However, after the decline of the Roman \n\nEmpire, anthropogenic Pb was strongly reduced at the end of the first millennium AD. \n\nThus, the lead isotopic composition of coeval samples from Portuguese canyons will \n\nprovide another estimate for the natural unpolluted end member, conceivably a lower \n\nlimit for 206Pb/207Pb if they include some anthropogenic Pb. These values (206Pb/207Pb = \n\n1.2050 \u00b1 0.002, 208Pb/206Pb = 2.0546 \u00b1 0.003) are close to the most recent global mean \n\nestimate (Millot et al., 2004) for weathering products of the upper continental crust \n\n(206Pb/207Pb = 1.2050, 208Pb/206Pb = 2.0618). \n\nThe Pb isotopic composition of Saharan dust (Grousset et al., 1994, 1995; Abouchami \n\n&amp; Zabel, 2003) and south Iberian pyrite belt ores (Sangster et al., 2000; Santos Zalduegui \n\net al., 2004) falls above the general regression line shown in Figure 7.11. Accordingly, \n\nthese sources are at most of minor importance for most of the Portuguese canyon \n\nsamples.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Comparison of Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 canyon sediments \n\n \n\nLead isotope variability along and between canyons \n\nTo elucidate differences in natural and anthropogenic lead along the canyon axes \n\nand between the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 canyon systems, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio in \n\nsurface sediments is plotted against water depth in Figure 7.12. \n\nThree trends are obvious from the figure:  \n\nFirst, samples from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon display consistently lower 206Pb/207Pb \n\nratios than Nazar\u00e9 Canyon samples, with hardly any overlap in isotopic ratios between the \n\ntwo areas. This indicates stronger anthropogenic influence in the southern study area; the \n\nsingle exception from this pattern is discussed below.  \n\nSecond, along both canyon axes the 206Pb/207Pb ratio generally increases with \n\nincreasing water depth, implying a decreasing anthropogenic lead input from the canyon \n\nheads, closest to potential source areas, to more offshore areas.  \n\nThird, samples from the shelf and slope adjacent to the canyons commonly exhibit \n\nhigher isotopic ratios than samples from the canyon axes. Yet, in both study areas mean \n\nisotopic values of canyon vs. shelf/slope sediments slightly overlap within one standard \n\ndeviation, essentially because divergences from the general pattern occur at intermediate \n\nwater depths (see below). \n\n \n\nR2 = 0.60\n\nR2 = 0.80\n\n1.175\n\n1.18\n\n1.185\n\n1.19\n\n1.195\n\n1.2\n\n1.205\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n\nWater Depth (m)\n\n20\n6 P\n\nb/\n20\n\n7 P\nb\n\nNazar\u00e9 shelf + slope\n\nNazare Canyon\n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal shelf + slope\n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon\n\n218-57\n225-02\n\n \nFigure 7.12.

Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 221\n\nDivergent patterns between canyons and adjacent open shelf and slope are most \n\nobvious at shallow water depth (&lt;400 m): sediments from the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyon heads (stations 204-18, 225-01 and 225-41) show by far the lowest \n\nisotope ratios for the respective areas, whereas distinctly higher ratios occur at \n\ncomparable water depth outside of the canyons (stations 218-57 and 225-02). \n\nInterestingly, isotope ratios at station 225-02 are much higher than anywhere else in the \n\nsouthern study area; this single location displays values comparable to and even towards \n\nthe upper limit of those measured in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon area. One may infer that the \n\nsediment collected at this upper slope location is of an older age, and that recent \n\nsedimentation is largely bypassing this site (Figure 3.2). \n\nIn contrast to the apparent weak anthropogenic influence detected in these upper \n\nslope samples, a relatively stronger influence was detected in some of the open slope \n\nstations at intermediate water depth (1300 \u2013 2500 m), which have isotope ratios \n\ncomparable to those observed inside the canyons. This possibly implies that material \n\ninitially trapped inside the canyon spills over and escapes to the adjacent slope at \n\nintermediate water depths, as previously suggested for the eastern U.S. continental shelf \n\nand slope (Biscaye &amp; Anderson, 1994) and northwestern Mediterranean continental \n\nmargin (Puig &amp; Palanques, 1998a). \n\nAt water depths > 4500 m in the Nazar\u00e9 study area, 206Pb/207Pb ratios in surface \n\nsediments of the slope are also comparable to those of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon thalweg. \n\nHowever, as further discussed below in section 7.4.3, different processes may be \n\nresponsible for the relatively minor influence of pollutant lead at both stations. \n\n \n\nQuantifying natural and anthropogenic Pb \n\nAs discussed above, Pb isotopic ratios of samples from the central Portuguese \n\nmargin, specifically their position along the mixing line in Figure 7.11, reflect the relative \n\nimportance of natural vs. anthropogenic sources of lead. Assuming binary mixing between \n\nnatural and anthropogenic end members of known and spatially constant lead isotopic \n\ncomposition, the percentage of anthropogenic lead (PbA) with respect to total Pb can be \n\ncalculated from the following formula: \n\n[ ]\n[ ] AN\n\nSN\n\ntot\n\nA\nA RR\n\nRR\nPb\nPb\n\nPb\n?\n?\n\n== *100*100%  \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 222 \n\nIn the right part of the formula, R represents the ratio 206Pb/207Pb; subscripts A and N \n\nrefer to the derived anthropogenic and natural end members, and subscript S to \n\nmeasured values of a given samples. Multiplying measured (bulk) Pb concentrations with \n\nthe relative proportion of PbA yields estimates for the concentration of anthropogenic Pb \n\nin sediment samples. \n\nThe regression in Figure 7.10b yields a 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.143 (1.134 \u2013 1.149, \n\n95 % confidence interval) for the anthropogenic end member (see section 7.4.1). Two \n\nvalues are proposed for the natural end member: end member N1 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.2050 \n\n\u00b1 0.002) is based on the composition of sediments samples from piston core 204-31 \n\ndated as older than 1000 AD, whereas end member N2 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.232 [1.226 \u2013 \n\n1.240, 95 % confidence interval]) is derived from the x-axis intercept in Figure 7.10a. As \n\ndiscussed above, these represent lower and upper limits for the natural isotopic signature. \n\nConsequently, subsequent calculations using either of the two natural end members yield \n\nlower and upper limits for anthropogenic Pb, presumably bracketing its \u201ctrue\u201d contribution \n\nto canyon sediments. Based on natural end member N1, about 20 % (range 10 \u2013 30 %) \n\nof total lead is of anthropogenic origin in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, vs. 35 % (25 \u2013 45 %) in the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and the Cascais Canyon. Using end member N2 results in values \n\nof 45 % (37 \u2013 52 %) and 55 % (48 \u2013 63 %) for the two canyon systems, respectively. \n\nUncertainties in these calculations dominantly relate to the possible isotopic range of \n\nnatural and anthropogenic end members and presumably affect all samples equally. In \n\nabsolute terms, they amount to 8 % or less (95 % confidence interval, e.g. 25 \u00b1 8 % \n\nanthropogenic Pb). The influence of analytical uncertainties is variable and generally \n\nsmaller (\u00b1 2.4 % on average) than the above-mentioned end member uncertainty. \n\nDifferences between both study areas are robust, except for the unlikely case of distinctly \n\ndifferent natural and/or anthropogenic end members for the Nazar\u00e9 vs. Lisbon-Set\u00fabal + \n\nCascais canyon systems. \n\nInferred concentrations of natural Pb are relatively constant across the entire study \n\narea (19 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5g g-1 or 27 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b5g g-1 using end members N1 and N2, respectively, n = \n\n32). In both cases, natural Pb concentrations are slightly elevated compared to average \n\nupper continental crust (cf. above), which may reflect preferential incorporation of Pb into \n\nthe fine fraction of marine sediments. \n\nDifferences in total (bulk) Pb concentrations thus essentially reflect variable input of \n\nanthropogenic Pb (Figure 7.13), superimposed on a nearly constant background of natural \n\nPb. Spatial variability of anthropogenic Pb retains patterns described above, i.e. higher \n\n\n\n7.

There is also a general decrease of anthropogenic Pb with \n\nincreasing water depth. In Figure 7.13 data from the Cascais Canyon and open slope \n\ntransects are also presented. The Cascais Canyon has slightly higher concentrations of \n\nanthropogenic Pb than the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon for equivalent water depths. For the \n\nopen slope transects, concentrations seem to be similar to those found on the walls and \n\nedges of the canyons at equivalent water depths. \n\n \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nWater Depth (m)\n\nan\nth\n\nro\npo\n\nge\nni\n\nc \nP\n\nb \n(\u00b5\n\ng \ng\n\n-1\n)\n\nSet\u00fabal canyon\nLisbon canyon\nLis-Set.

This is \n\nconsistent with sediment supply by major rivers, potentially carrying pollutant material, \n\nand with proximity of the southern area to heavily populated and industrialised areas. In \n\nparticular, the Tagus River was previously identified as a major source of other pollutants \n\nmetals including Hg, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn (Figueres et al., 1985; Cott\u00e9-Krief et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Link with sediment transport processes (sediment trap vs. core \n\ntop sediments) \n\nCore top samples discussed above yield an integrated signal over annual to decadal \n\ntimescales, whereas particulate material from sediment traps correspond to sampling \n\nintervals of one day in the upper canyon up to two to four weeks in the middle to lower \n\ncanyon. Comparison of the two sample sets of the present study may yield clues on short-\n\nterm depositional processes and their influence on the \u201cfinal\u201d sedimentary signal. \n\nIn most of the deployments done in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and in the middle \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon, 206Pb/207Pb ratios for particulate material from individual sediment trap \n\ndeployments commonly span relatively narrow ranges and are comparable to values \n\nobserved in surface sediments at similar water depths (Figure 7.14). Hence, sediment \n\ntrap data collected in these areas accurately reflect longer-term depositional conditions; \n\nthe cases where this pattern was not found are discussed below. \n\nFor sediment trap samples from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, Richter et al. (2009) noticed a \n\nconspicuous decrease of 206Pb/207Pb ratios with decreasing mass deposition flux (Figure \n\n7.15b). This trend was shown by four of the five trap deployments; only the samples of \n\ndeployment 236-07 showed a deviating pattern. Apparently, samples with highest mass \n\nflux, generally occurring in the upper reaches of the canyon, had the lowest relative \n\ncontribution of anthropogenic Pb, whereas samples with lowest mass fluxes, occurring in \n\nthe lower reaches of the canyon, showed the highest relative contribution of \n\nanthropogenic Pb. Intuitively, however, one would expect the opposite, with samples \n\nfrom the upper canyon, being nearer to source areas of anthropogenic lead on land, to \n\nhave the highest relative contribution of anthropogenic lead. Richter et al. (2009) \n\ninterpreted the lower anthropogenic contribution in the upper canyon samples as \n\nreflecting dilution of recent particulate material with reworked pre-industrial sediment, \n\nunder influence of the vigorous tidal currents. Further down the canyon, where tidal \n\ncurrents are reduced in strength, the effect of dilution with reworked older sediments \n\nwould become less pronounced. \n\nSediment trap samples from the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon display a different \n\nrelationship between mass flux and 206Pb/207Pb (Figure 7.15a). Excluding the samples \n\nfrom the lower Set\u00fabal Canyon (252-62), there seems to be an opposite trend as \n\nobserved for the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. Especially in the Lisbon Canyon  206Pb/207Pb ratios seem \n\nto increase with decreasing mass flux and increasing depth down-canyon, implying that \n\n\n\n7.

In a), orange and green symbols represent samples from, respectively, the Lisbon \nand Set\u00fabal Canyon.

Low mass \n\nfluxes at these sites (0.37 \u2013 1.38 g m-2 d-1 and 0.09 \u2013 0.23 g m-2 d-1 in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nand Nazar\u00e9 canyons, respectively, represent pelagic settling from the overlying water \n\ncolumn. This is supported by closely similar ranges of 206Pb/207Pb ratios in trap particulate \n\nmaterial and in late 20th century regional surface waters \u2013 the latter ranging between \n\n1.1670 and 1.1850 (V\u00e9ron et al., 1994; Weiss et al., 2003). The different isotopic \n\nsignature of pelagic material settling in the lower Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, \n\ncompared to material collected in sediment traps further up-canyon and accumulated in \n\nsurface sediments, is also expressed in a different relationship between isotopic ratio and \n\nPb concentration as illustrated in Figure 7.10.

In a orange and green symbols represent samples from the \nLisbon and Set\u00fabal Canyon, respectively. Note inversed logarithmic x-axis for comparison with previous plots \nwith water depth on x-axis (mass fluxes generally decrease with increasing water depth). \n\n \n\nSurface sediment samples from comparable water depths in the lower Set\u00fabal and \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon and adjacent canyon edge (respectively, 225-07, 225-22 and 225-25) \n\ndisplay distinctly higher 206Pb/207Pb ratios implying lower relative contributions of pollutant \n\nlead. For the two sites in the canyon axis, the relatively lower contribution of \n\nanthropogenic lead may be attributed to lateral supply of reworked older sediments. This \n\nseems to be confirmed by observed higher lithogenic content of canyon axis sediments, \n\ncompared to the material collected in sediment traps (Chapter 6). For station 225-25 \n\nlocated on the southern edge of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, however, lateral supply of reworked \n\nsediment can be assumed to be negligible. High carbonate content observed at this \n\nlocation (45 % compared to 22 % inside the canyon; see below Figure 7.17b) also implies \n\nthat sediments are derived from vertical settling through the overlying water column \n\nrather than lateral advection of resuspended canyon sediment rich in lithogenic material.   \n\nLow sediment accumulation rate of 0.1 g m-2 d-1, derived from planktonic foraminiferal \n\nbiostratigraphy in a piston core from the same location (De Stigter et al., 2007b), which is \n\nsimilar to mass deposition flux measured in the deepest sediment trap deployment in the \n\nlower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, implies that the sediment layer representing the last 150 years of \n\nindustrial development can only be a few mm thick which makes reworking of pre-\n\nindustrial sediment by recent bioturbation very likely. Hence, the relatively high \n206Pb/207Pb in open slope surface sediment may be attributed to biological mixing with \n\nunderlying unpolluted sediments. \n\nIn the canyon thalweg, the long-term accumulation rate of 0.8 g m-2 d-1 in sediment \n\ncore 225-22 (De Stigter et al., 2007b) is almost one order of magnitude higher than mass \n\nfluxes observed in the trap at the same location. It seems therefore that the surface \n\nsediment represents not only material derived from pelagic settling, but in addition \n\n\n\n7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central \nPortuguese continental margin \n\n 227\n\nmaterial supplied by intermittent sediment gravity flows. A sediment gravity flow event \n\nwas recorded at the shallower trap site 218-55 (4298 m WD); the corresponding sample \n\nshowed a markedly higher mass flux than all other samples from the same deployment \n\n(46 g m-2 d-1 vs. 0.5 \u2013 2.7 g m-2 d-1). Compared to other samples collected by the same \n\ntrap, material delivered during this sedimentation event was distinctly coarser-grained and \n\ndisplayed lower carbonate content. In this respect, it resembles particulate matter \n\ncollected by upper and middle canyon traps, strongly suggesting down-canyon transport \n\nrather than local slumping from canyon walls (for more information cf. De Stigter et al., \n\n2007b). \n\nThe 206Pb/207Pb ratio for the sediment trap sample corresponding to the sediment \n\ngravity flow event is closely similar to the Pb isotopic ratio of surface sediments in the \n\nlower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. It seems therefore that episodic sediment gravity flows dominate \n\nthe integrated sedimentary signal in the lower canyon. It is worth noting that 206Pb/207Pb \n\nratio of the trap sample corresponding to the gravity flow event is higher than all samples \n\nfrom shallower sites, which is arguably inconsistent with preferential down-canyon \n\ntransport of pollutant lead. Presumably, the gravity flow deposit also incorporates older \n\npre-industrial sediments, masking the isotopic signature of pollutant lead. \n\nThe long-term sediment accumulation rate of 0.8 g m-2 d-1 recorded in the lower \n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (core 225-07, 4451 m WD) is comparable to mass fluxes observed in the \n\ntrap at the same location (0.4 \u2013 1.4 g m-2 d-1 - Chapter 6 on pg. 150) confirms that \n\nsediment gravity flows do not significantly contribute to recent sedimentation. The \n\ndistinctly higher 206Pb/207Pb ratio in surface sediments compared to trap samples must \n\ntherefore be explained as a result of biological mixing with underlying unpolluted \n\nsediments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Major pathways of recent terrigenous sediment transport on the \n\ncentral Portuguese margin \n\nOn the central Portuguese margin three major submarine canyons connect the \n\ncontinental shelf with the abyssal plain: the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal, Cascais and Nazar\u00e9 canyons. \n\nDespite their geographic proximity, the composition of surface sediments from the \n\ncanyons reflects different activity of these canyons in channelling sediments to their lower \n\nreaches and finally to the abyssal plain. The shelf and slope in between and neighbouring \n\nthese submarine canyons also show differences in composition of surface sediments \n\ngiving evidence of different processes driving sediment transport and deposition. \n\nOn the Sines margin lithogenic contents are high (70-75 %), considering that no \n\nmajor watercourse is discharging on this area. These high contents of lithogenic material \n\nare probably related to the progressive deposition of suspended fine-grained terrigenous \n\nmaterial entrained by the flow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water along the upper \n\ncontinental slope (Grousset et al., 1988). Northwards from the Sines margin and after \n\ninteracting with the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon a considerable portion of the lower-core water \n\nflows into the interior of the ocean (Bower et al., 2002) and therefore the contribution of \n\nterrigenous material from this water mass to the seabed is much reduced on the \n\nEstremadura margin and further north (Figure 8.1). \n\nCompared to the Sines margin, the middle and lower Set\u00fabal Canyon has only \n\nslightly higher lithogenic content (72-77 %), suggesting that it is mostly accumulating \n\nsediment from the same source as is supplying sediment to the Sines slope, with minor \n\naddition of lithogenic material through the Lisbon Canyon and perhaps even less through \n\nthe upper Set\u00fabal Canyon. In comparison to the open slope, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nCascais canyons act as natural traps of organic material, specially the upper regions. \n\nContents of organic matter above 3 % are only found in the upper canyon branches and \n\naccording to Garc\u00eda et al. (2010) only in these shallower areas a considerable portion of \n\nthis organic matter is bioavailable. The mechanisms driving sediment dynamics in this \n\ncanyon system will be further discussed in section 8.3.  \n\nThe Estremadura slope has relatively low lithogenic contents (39-67 %), suggesting \n\nbypassing of terrigenous sediment entering via the shelf and through the Cascais and \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 232 \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons. Terrigenous input to this part of the margin is low for what concerns the \n\nshelf as testified by the extensive areas of rock outcrops which appear from below a \n\ndiscontinous and relatively thin Holocene sediment cover (Badagola et al., 2006). The \n\nEstremadura margin is, however, an area marked by important events of upwelling \n\n(Salgueiro et al., 2008) which favour biological productivity in surface water, which in turn \n\nleads to deposition of carbonate-rich pelagic sediments. \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon is characterised by efficient down-canyon sediment transport and \n\ntherefore contents of lithogenic material in surface sediments are higher than 80 % \n\nthroughout the canyon, even in the lower canyon. Contents of organic matter are also \n\nhigh within the canyon, never decreasing below 3 %. However, according to Garc\u00eda et al. \n\n(2007) most of this organic material is relatively degraded and of little use for living \n\norganisms. Especially in the lower canyon only a minor fraction is of biological interest. It \n\nis likely that most of the labile material is degraded on the way down. According to De \n\nStigter et al. (2007b), particulate matter is mainly transported by tidal currents until the \n\nmiddle canyon and then by intermittent gravity flows further down to the lower canyon \n\nand to the abyssal plain. All together, it may take more than a year for particulate matter \n\nto travel from the canyon head to the mouth. Whereas the bulk of terrigenous sediments \n\nwill not be much altered on such timescale and will eventually arrive at the abyssal plain, \n\ndegradable organic material may never come that far. \n\nThe slope off Mondego shows variable contents of lithogenic material (49-80 %). \n\nMost of the slope area below 1000 m WD is characterised by a reduced supply of \n\nterrigenous sediment and predominance of pelagic sediment supply. The upper slope \n\nseems to receive a relatively abundant supply of fresh terrigenous sediment, \n\ncharacterised by high contents of feldspars, coming from the nearby Mondego River or \n\npossibly other rivers debouching north from this area (Douro, Minho, C\u00e1vado, Lima). Most \n\nof this terrigenous material seems not to spread to the slope area below 1000 m WD, \n\nprobably as a result of blocking by slope currents. \n\nOverall, just by considering the distribution of terrigenous material it becomes \n\nevident that sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by the \n\nsubmarine canyons. As already suggested by other authors (e.g. Van Weering et al., \n\n2002; Oliveira et al., 2007), export of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental \n\nmargin is restricted by slope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-\n\nslope transport. Partitioning of sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 233\n\nmay to some extent also be attributed to modifications of along-slope circulation where \n\nsubmarine canyons cross the path of slope currents. \n\n  \n\n8.2. Pathways of recent terrigenous sediment transport in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent continental shelf and slope \n\n8.2.1. Continental shelf and sediment sources from the hinterland \n\nThe sedimentary deposits on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf range from coarse sand \n\nwith less than 10 % of fine-grained material (&lt;63 \u00b5m) to mud deposits with more than \n\n90 % of fine-grained material. On the Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf, sandy deposits prevail and \n\nmuddy sediments are restricted to the northern coast of the Set\u00fabal bay near the \n\nentrance of the Sado Estuary and to the upper reaches of the Set\u00fabal Canyon. On the \n\nother hand, the Lisbon shelf is covered by a large expanse of mud deposit which occupies \n\nalmost the entire shelf area, and which is largely fed by sediment supplied by the Tagus \n\nRiver. \n\nSince at the present sea-level stand most of the sediment added to the shelf by \n\ncontinental runoff consists of fine-grained material (e.g. Ferreira et al., 2008), one may \n\ndeduce from the location of the fine-grained sediment deposits where on the shelf the \n\nmain foci of recent sediment deposition are located. The mineralogical data presented in \n\nChapter 4, specifically with regard to contents of plagioclase and kaolinite, and the \n\ncrystallinity index of illite show that indeed sediments from the Tagus and Sado mud \n\npatches are fresher in a mineralogical sense than the fine fractions contained in coarser \n\nsediment deposits. According to Jouanneau et al. (1998) the surface nepheloid layers \n\nassociated with the Tagus and Sado river discharge do not extend far onto the shelf, \n\nimplying that most of the fine-grained riverine sediment input settles on the shelf and \n\naccumulates in the mud patches close to the river mouths. The distribution of plagioclase \n\nin shelf sediments, as a tracer of relatively unaltered riverine sediment input, and \n\nenrichment of trace metals (especially Zn and Cu) associated with industrial activities on \n\nland, point to the Tagus and Sado rivers as the main contributors of fine-grained \n\nsediments to the Tagus and Sado mud patches (Figure 8.1).  \n\nIn the case of the Tagus mud patch, the erosion of sea-cliffs from the adjacent \n\ncoastal arc between the Fonte da Telha beach and Cape Espichel seems to be an \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 234 \n\nimportant additional source of fine-grained sediments. As described in Chapter 4, detritus \n\nproduced by sea-cliff erosion first nourishes the adjacent beach system and then reaches \n\nthe adjacent shelf after high-energy storms. Contributions of sediments from the Albufeira \n\nLagoon to the shelf certainly exist, but the mineralogical and geochemical signatures of \n\nthe lagoon were not assessed and surface sediments from the shelf did not show a \n\ndistinct signature which could be related to contributions from the lagoon. \n\nContributions from sea-cliffs and coastal lagoons are more easily tracked in the Tr\u00f3ia-\n\nSines coastal arc since terrigenous sediment contributions from other sources are less \n\nimportant here and therefore dilution effects are less strong. Sea-cliffs in this coastal \n\nstretch are an important source of sediments to the beach system (e.g. Quevauviller, \n\n1987; Freitas et al., 1999) and subsequently to the adjacent shelf after storm waves wash \n\nthe sediment offshore (Figure 8.1). Fine-grained sediment adsorbed to the beach sands is \n\ntransported southward as sediment is carried along with the longshore drift. On the inner \n\nshelf adjacent to the sea-cliffs the proportion of lithogenic minerals to carbonates is \n\nmarkedly enhanced. This ratio reaches the highest values on the inner shelf close to the \n\nSt. Andr\u00e9 and Melides lagoons. During the few weeks of the year that these lagoons are \n\nartificially opened to the sea, sediments are exported offshore, imprinting their \n\nmineralogical and geochemical signatures in the sedimentary deposits of the inner shelf \n\n(Chapters 4 and 5). Contributions of detritus resulting from the erosion of the Sines sub-\n\nvolcanic massif to shelf deposits north of Cape Sines appear to be limited, which is \n\nexplained by the prevailing southward transport along the coastal arc. Substantial \n\nnorthward longshore drift occurs only during infrequent southwesterly storms, which \n\ntypically blow no more than 2 days per year (Quevauviller, 1988). \n\n \n\n8.2.2. Continental shelf and adjacent slope \n\nIn the present study the Sines continental margin is well represented by surface \n\nsediment samples collected from water depths between 15 and 4000 m. The \n\nmineralogical and geochemical data presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 show that on the \n\nSines margin four different bathymetric zones can be distinguished: inner + middle shelf \n\n(&lt;100 m WD); outer shelf + upper slope (100 \u2013 500 m WD); upper slope between 500 \n\nand 2000 m WD and middle to lower slope below 2000 m WD. \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 235\n\nThe Sines inner+middle shelf is characterised by the highest contents of terrigenous \n\nminerals, reflected by L/C ratios > 2.0. Despite the vigorous hydrodynamics of this area, \n\ncontents of phyllosilicates and plagioclase may reach high values of 27 and 25 %, \n\nrespectively, especially close to the source areas of these minerals: sea-cliffs and coastal \n\nlagoons, respectively. \n\nOn the outer shelf/upper slope reworked shelf sediments predominate, and fresh \n\ninput of terrigenous material from the hinterland is lower compared to the inner+middle \n\nshelf. This is reflected by lower contents of plagioclase and phyllosilicates in the fine \n\nsediment fraction, 4 - 7 % and 9 - 17 %, respectively, whereas calcite contents reach the \n\nhighest values of > 50 % and L/C ratios are generally below 1.5. \n\nThe upper slope between 500 and 2000 m WD seems to represent a transition zone \n\nwhere terrigenous input increases again (1.5 &lt;L/C &lt;2.0). As discussed in Chapter 6 \n\n(section 6.7.3, pg. 182), modal grain size as well as carbonate content of surface \n\nsediments decrease from 500 to 1500-2000 m WD. The present study, as well as some \n\nprevious studies (e.g. Sch\u00f6nfeld, 1997), show that fine-grained sediments are removed by \n\nwinnowing from the shallower part of the upper slope which is under the influence of the \n\nupper Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), and are deposited near the lower MOW limit \n\ntogether with suspended material entrained by the MOW from the Alboran Sea (Figure \n\n8.1). Material from the latter source is characterised by relatively high contents of \n\nsmectite and degraded kaolinite. \n\nOn the middle and lower slope, below 2000 m WD, surface sediments have modal \n\ngrain sizes typical for hemipelagic sedimentation (&lt;8 \u00b5m). In this same depth zone, \n\ncontents of phyllosilicates in the fine sediment fraction increase to 38 %. Part of the \n\nsediments settling in this area may well derive from the MOW, as implied by the relatively \n\nhigh contents of kaolinite and smectite in sediments found even as deep as 3900 m WD. \n\nAs observed in the south-western part of the Gulf of Cadiz, input from the MOW may be \n\nfound in areas where the MOW flows detached from the seafloor, as the particles settle \n\nout from the MOW and accumulate as hemipelagites on the seabed (Bower et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 236 \n\n8.2.3. The Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons and adjacent shelf \n\n \n\nPresent-day activity of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons \n\nThe widespread occurrence of bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers in the upper \n\nreaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais Canyon and high sediment fluxes recorded in \n\nsediment traps and in seabed deposits, are clear evidence of the dynamic sedimentary \n\nenvironment present within these canyons. SPM concentrations (De Stigter et al., in \n\npress) and sediment accumulation rates in the upper canyons are an order of magnitude \n\nhigher than the ones measured at comparable depths on adjacent slope areas, and values \n\nreported from other parts of the western Iberian margin (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1984; McCave &amp; \n\nHall, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Van Weering et al., 2002). The active sedimentary \n\nregime of the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon is undoubtedly related in the first place to its \n\nposition, deeply entrenched in the continental shelf with the two canyon heads in the \n\nproximity of the coast, and thus forming a natural trap for sediments carried along by \n\nshelf currents. Shallow intermediate nepheloid layers observed in the upper canyon at \n\ndepths corresponding to that of the adjacent shelf, are indications that suspended \n\nsediment enters the canyon via bottom nepheloid layers detached from the shelf edge \n\n(De Stigter et al., in press). When crossing the canyon, the nepheloid layers will lose part \n\nof their suspended sediment load by settling. Resuspension of shelf sediments is likely to \n\noccur under influence of storm waves, particularly those incident from southwesterly \n\ndirection (Figure 8.1). The Lisbon and Set\u00fabal shelves are sheltered from northwesterly \n\nstorms by the prominent Cape Roca and Cape Espichel, respectively. Internal tidal waves \n\ngenerated on the edges of the canyon and propagating over the adjacent shelf may be an \n\nadditional mechanism resuspending shelf sediments around the canyon, analogous to \n\nwhat has been observed for the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon area (Quaresma et al., 2007). Direct \n\nsediment input from the Tagus and Sado river plumes is probably limited, as indicated by \n\nprevious observations by Jouanneau et al. (1998). These authors observed that surface \n\nnepheloid layers issuing from the river mouths do not extend far onto the shelf but are \n\npredominantly deflected to the west following the coast. Sediment transport from the \n\nrivers to the canyons appears to be mostly indirectly via bottom nepheloid layers formed \n\nby resuspension of prodelta deposits (Tagus and Sado mud patches). However, the \n\ndispersal of suspended particulate matter over the shelf off the Tagus and Sado estuaries \n\nis still basically unknown for typical winter conditions since the study done by Jouanneau \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 237\n\net al. (1998) refer to particularly dry years (1993-1995), during which the strong increase \n\nin water discharge normally observed during winter did not occur. Trapped in the upper \n\ncanyon, fine-grained sediments are subject to frequent resuspension and transport by the \n\ninternal tide, as inferred from relatively high loads of SPM in bottom and intermediate \n\nwaters. A depocentre of fine-grained sediments was identified in both the Lisbon and \n\nupper Set\u00fabal canyon branches between 1100 and 1400 m WD (Figure 8.1). These \n\nsediment depocentres are marked by a maximum in SAR values in this depth interval and \n\nby high contents of organic matter in the surface sediment. Discharge of dredged \n\nestuarine sediments in the Lisbon Canyon has been confirmed to have occurred in 2005 \n\nand 2007 and may help to explain surface sediments characteristics in the upper reaches \n\nof the canyon, namely, the high contents of organic and lithogenic contents.  \n\nMuch lower SPM concentrations (De Stigter et al., in press) and sediment \n\naccumulation rates observed in the middle and lower canyon, comparable to those of the \n\nadjacent open slope, suggest that this part of the canyon has a much less active \n\nsedimentary regime than the upper canyon, and does not receive major input of sediment \n\nfrom either the upper canyon or from the adjacent open slope, besides the background \n\npelagic input. Lack of down-canyon sediment transport seems to be confirmed by trends \n\nin particle size and bulk composition of surface sediments of the canyon and adjacent \n\nslope. A clear enrichment of lithogenic material, on the order of ~10 % above the \n\nbackground lithogenic content found further down-canyon and on the adjacent slope, was \n\nonly observed in the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais Canyon. A general lack of \n\ndown-canyon sediment transport was confirmed also by the seaward logarithmic decrease \n\nof Pb and Zn enrichment. Both elements are mainly associated with terrigenous sediment \n\ninput to this area (Chapter 7). \n\nThis is clearly different from the pattern observed in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, where \n\nsediment with strong predominance of lithogenic material is observed all along the axis of \n\nthe canyon, contrasting with finer-grained sediment with lower lithogenic content on the \n\nadjacent slope. \n\n \n\nSediment transport by the internal tide \n\nThe close match between semi-diurnal peaks in current speed and peaks in bottom \n\nwater turbidity, as recorded in the upper Lisbon and Set\u00fabal canyon by the BOBO landers, \n\ndemonstrate the prominent role of tidal currents in resuspending and transporting fine-\n\ngrained sediments. The BOBO lander records consistently show resuspension occurring \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 238 \n\nwhen currents exceed a threshold of 15-25 cm s-1. Critical erosion velocity u* for \n\nresuspending particles from the seabed, determined experimentally for surface sediments \n\nfrom the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, are reported by Garc\u00eda et al. (2010). The experimentally \n\ndetermined threshold values from the latter authors are in agreement with those derived \n\nfrom the BOBO lander records. \n\nInternal tides, such as observed in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, are clearly an \n\nimportant mechanism of sediment transport in many submarine canyons (Shepard et al., \n\n1979; Gardner, 1989; Petruncio et al., 1998; Durrieu de Madron et al., 1999), \n\nresuspending sediments especially in narrow upper canyon sections where tidal energy is \n\nfocused, and driving the flow of sediment-laden waters up and down the canyon axis. A \n\nparticular characteristic of tidal currents in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon is the prevalence of \n\nnet up-canyon directed flow, observed in four of the seven sites where currents were \n\nrecorded. Since the strongest currents in all these cases were also directed up-canyon, it \n\ncan be assumed that the prevalent direction of suspended sediment transport was up-\n\ncanyon as well. This is in apparent contrast with the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, where a net down-\n\ncanyon water and sediment transport was observed in a similar observational setup (De \n\nStigter et al., 2007b). As a cautionary remark it must be added here that some of the \n\nrecords obtained from the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon were only of short duration of 3-\n\n7 days, and thus are not necessarily representative for the longer term current regime. In \n\nthe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, reversals in net flow direction were observed in the canyon down to \n\ndepths of 300 m, in response to changes in wind direction and shelf circulation (Tyler et \n\nal., 2009). Currents in the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon may in a similar manner be \n\ncoupled to variable surface water circulation. \n\nIn the upper canyons mass deposition fluxes estimated using sediment traps are \n\nconsistently higher than SARs determined in the seabed through 210Pb profiles in sediment \n\ncores. This indicates resuspension of seabed sediments, most certainly as a reflection of \n\nstrong near-bottom current dynamics, and oversampling in the trap after repeated cycles \n\nof resuspension and deposition.  \n\nLow values of bottom water turbidity observed in BOBO lander deployments in the \n\nmiddle and lower canyon, combined with the observation that mass deposition fluxes \n\nmeasured in sediment traps and seabed SARs are well comparable, indicate that sediment \n\nresuspension from the seabed is not as important as in the upper reaches of the canyon, \n\nand that sedimentation prevails. This seems in agreement with the overall slower bottom \n\ncurrents and relatively infrequent resuspension recorded in the middle part of the canyon, \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 239\n\nbut the combination of intermittent high current speeds in the lower canyon with low \n\nturbidity and low deposition flux is puzzling. Possibly the sediment in the lower canyon is \n\nlocally more cohesive or coarser grained, although this is not evident from the one core \n\nwhich was collected from that area.  \n\n  \n\nSediment transport by sediment gravity flows \n\nLow frequency and high-energy processes like gravity flows are processes capable of \n\ntransporting considerable amounts of sediment further down-canyon. Presently, they \n\nseem however very rare in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. During the total time of five years \n\nand six months of BOBO deployments (2002 - 2007) no gravity flows were recorded in \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon while for a similar period of time in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon at least \n\nthree important mass flux events were recorded (De Stigter et al., 2007b). These mass \n\nsediment transport processes seem to be also common in other active canyons systems \n\nlike the Monterey Canyon (Xu et al., 2002), the Congo Canyon (Khripounoff et al., 2003) \n\nand the Palam\u00f3s Canyon (Palanques et al., 2005). \n\nThat sediment mass transport events reaching the lower canyon are rare is \n\nconfirmed by the overall scarcity of turbidite layers in sediments of late Holocene age \n\nrecovered in cores from the lower canyon (Arzola et al., 2008). The most recent turbidite \n\nlayer encountered in a core from the lower canyon (225-07) was tentatively attributed to \n\nthe Lisbon earthquake of 1755, based on 210Pb geochronology (De Stigter et al., in press). \n\nThe latter turbidite layer contained abundant quartz and micas (De Stigter et al., \n\nunpublished data), indicating that the sediment was transported from the upper canyon \n\nreaches, and did not originate from reworking of hemipelagic sediments by a local slope \n\nfailure. It represents the most recent major event, indicating that only powerful events \n\nlike such an earthquake are capable of remobilising and transporting sediment down-\n\ncanyon to such water depths. Even though such events may appear rare on the time-\n\nscale represented by short sediment cores and in-situ observation with landers, on \n\ngeological timescales submarine canyons are primarily shaped by the action of mass \n\nsediment transport processes. The Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon is no exception to this as \n\nshown by data presented by Lastras et al. (2009). Slump scars, giant landslides blocks, \n\nlarge scours and sediment waves were observed especially in the canyon mouth area, \n\ntestifying of high energy events occurring in the geologically recent past of the canyon. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 240 \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon as sediment trap \n\nThe data presented in Chapters 6 and 7 and summarised above seem to indicate that \n\nthe upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais Canyon presently act as traps for \n\nfine-grained sediments entrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf and slope, without \n\nsubstantial down-canyon dispersal to the middle and lower reaches. From the results here \n\npresented one may identify two important factors which contribute to the trapping effect \n\nof the canyon. First an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, which drives \n\nparticles settling in the upper canyon toward the canyon head rather than disperse them \n\ndown-canyon. The cause of the up-canyon flow probably has to be sought in the \n\ninteraction of canyon morphology and present-day circulation patterns along the margin. \n\nThe second factor is the apparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other \n\ncanyon systems are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Canyons known \n\nfor active sediment gravity flows have in common that they head very near-shore, thus \n\nreceiving massive input of sand and silt from longshore transport or riverine input. The \n\nfast accumulation of incohesive sediment on steep sides of the canyon head leads to \n\nfrequent sediment slides, which may evolve into energetic high-density turbidity currents \n\nrunning out towards deeper water. Large scale sediment waves typically encountered in \n\nthe head of active canyons appear indicative of deposition from high energy turbidity \n\ncurrents (Smith et al., 2005). Whereas such structures are present in the head of Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon (Duarte et al., 2000) they were not noticed in the detailed morphological study of \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons by Lastras et al. (2009). Probably the heads of \n\nthese canyons, located at 5, 6 and 22 km, respectively, from the nearest shoreline, are \n\ntoo far off the coast to intercept longshore sediment transport. Thus sediment input is \n\nlargely restricted to fine-grained material settling from nepheloid layers passing over the \n\nupper canyon. In addition, the shelter against northwesterly storms provided by \n\nprominent coastal capes may limit sediment resuspension on the shelf and hence also \n\nlimit suspended sediment supply to the canyons. This geomorphological setting is in clear \n\ncontrast to the more exposed Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The rareness of sediment gravity flows \n\nflushing the canyon may give fine-grained sediment accumulating in the canyon time to \n\ncompact into cohesive stable deposits, thus further reducing the chance of remobilisation. \n\nThe presence of a sediment-filled thalweg of several hundred meters wide in the upper \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, compared to the strongly incised narrow thalweg in the active \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon, may thus reflect the infrequent flushing of the canyon since the last \n\nglacial sea level lowstand. \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 241\n\nIn addition to sediment input from the shelf, a substantial part of sediment trapped \n\nin the canyon may also be derived from the adjacent slope, and notably from the interval \n\nbetween 500 and 1500 m occupied by the northward flowing Mediterranean Outflow \n\nWater (MOW). The strong density gradients at the boundaries of the MOW are thought to \n\nfavour internal wave activity and sediment resuspension (McCave &amp; Hall, 2002), whereas \n\nsuspended sediment would be carried along-slope by the poleward flow of the water \n\nmass. From Cape S\u00e3o Vicente, the southernmost point of the Portuguese mainland where \n\nthe MOW turns northward, the MOW flows practically unobstructed along the smooth and \n\ngently sloping Alentejo margin until the abrupt intersection with the Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nIndications from sedimentology and benthic foraminifera for enhanced hydrodynamic \n\nenergy and lateral sediment transport coinciding with the path of the MOW on the \n\nsouthern Portuguese slope have been reported by Sch\u00f6nfeld (1997) and, for what \n\nconcerns sedimentology, were confirmed by the data here presented (Chapter 6, section \n\n6.7.3, pg. 182). As reported by De Stigter et al. (in press), enhanced SPM concentrations \n\nnoticed within the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon at 500 and 1500 m depth may primarily be due \n\nto resuspension by focusing of internal tides along the canyon axis, but may conceivably \n\nalso include suspended sediment entering via the MOW from the slope south of the \n\ncanyon. The similarity in bulk sediment characteristics on the open slope and within the \n\ncanyon (especially SPM caught in sediment traps) at this depth seems to be consistent \n\nwith this interpretation (Chapter 6). Sediment accumulation rates in the upper Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon, the area potentially affected by lateral sediment input via the MOW, are well \n\nabove the background hemipelagic sedimentation as can be assessed from mass fluxes in \n\nsediment traps and surface sediments in the lower canyon. However, since sediment \n\naccumulation on the canyon walls and edges is not constrained by the present data, the \n\nenhanced rates may also be explained as the result of focusing of sedimentation on the \n\ncanyon thalweg. \n\nIn their function as traps for suspended particulate matter, supplied laterally from the \n\nadjacent shelf and slope and vertically from the overlying water column, the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal and Cascais canyons constitute not only depocentres for inert sediment but also \n\nfor biologically active organic material. Accumulation of relatively fresh organic material \n\nespecially in the upper canyon, confirmed by studies of Pusceddu et al. (2010) and Garc\u00eda \n\net al. (2010), explains the enhanced abundance of benthic foraminifera (Koho et al., \n\n2008), and macrofauna (Cunha et al., in press) observed in these canyons. Whereas the \n\nlatter studies concerned fauna on soft substrates of the sediment thalweg, abundant \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 242 \n\nsuspension feeding fauna observed with underwater cameras on steep canyon walls is \n\nlikely to be favoured by the continuous flow of particle-rich water driven by the internal \n\ntide in the canyon. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.1. Scheme showing the main pathways of fine-grained sediment dispersal on the continental margin \nbetween Cape Raso and Cape Sines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 243\n\n8.3. Trace metal enrichment in sediments from the central Portuguese \n\ncontinental margin \n\nContents of major elements Ca, Al and Fe and some trace metals like Cr and Ni in \n\nsurface sediments of central Portuguese canyons and open slopes appear mostly equal to \n\ncontents of these elements in pre-industrial sediments, meaning that in terms of bulk \n\ncomposition the sediment has not changed over the last 150 years. Pre-industrial contents \n\nof trace metals, Fe and Al are largely similar for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nsystems, whereas recent surface sediments and suspended particulate matter usually \n\nshow higher concentrations of trace metals, with somewhat diverging values between \n\nboth areas. Surface sediments and suspended particulate matter in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon have higher mean concentrations of Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cu and Ni compared to the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon. Regarding only surface sediments, the highest mean concentrations for \n\nall trace metals are found in the Cascais canyon. The assessment of trace metal \n\nenrichment in present-day sediments on the basis of calculated enrichment factors \n\nsupports the above observations. In both canyon systems, the anthropogenic contribution \n\nto total inventories of Pb and Zn generally decreases with increasing water depth. \n\nDifferent from Pb and Zn, present-day Cu enrichment appears to increase towards deeper \n\nwater where pelagic sedimentation is predominant, suggesting that dispersal of this trace \n\nmetal is at least partially linked with surface water plankton production. \n\nThe assessment of Pb enrichment on the basis of lead stable isotope ratios indicates \n\nthat lead in present-day surface sediments and SPM represents a mixture between \n\nanthropogenic contaminant lead and an unpolluted \u201ccrustal\u201d end member. Pollutant lead \n\nappears to be mostly derived from industrial sources, whereas the current contribution of \n\nremnant gasoline lead additives is of minor importance. In accordance with the observed \n\nstronger enrichment of trace metals in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons, as \n\ncompared to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, the anthropogenic signature in Pb isotopes appears also \n\nmore pronounced in the southern canyons. Percentages of excess trace metal in the \n\nsediment column deposited over the last 150 years are also higher for the southern \n\ncanyons, especially the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. The Lisbon Canyon has around 10 to \n\n15 % more anthropogenic Pb than the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon for comparable water depths. This \n\ndifference between both areas refers both to present-day sediments (determined through \n\nPb stable isotopes) and to sediments deposited over the last 150 years (determined \n\nthrough inventories of excess Pb). \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 244 \n\nThe consistently higher loading of anthropogenic trace metals in the southern \n\ncanyons is consistent with the proximity of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons to heavily \n\npopulated and industrialised areas, and with sediment input from the Tagus Estuary, a \n\npotential major source of pollutants particles. The degree of trace metal enrichment found \n\nin the Lisbon and Cascais canyons is comparable to what has been previously published \n\nfrom other canyon and slope areas, such as the Foix Canyon in the NW Mediterranean \n\n(Palanques et al., 2008), the Gulf of Lions continental slope in the NW Mediterranean \n\n(Miralles et al., 2006), and the Kaoping Canyon off Taiwan (Hung &amp; Hsu, 2004). \n\nFocusing on the shelf area adjacent to the southern canyons, trace metal enrichment \n\nis widespread to the entire studied area of the Lisbon shelf while the Set\u00fabal and Sines \n\nshelves have areas enriched in trace metals (Sado mud patch and the inner shelf) which \n\ncontrast with others where pre-industrial concentrations where found on surface \n\nsediments. As mentioned above, the Tagus Estuary is one of the main sources of \n\nanthropogenic trace metals to the adjacent shelf, but some additional sources of \n\nanthropogenic input were detected in sediments, in particular the Sado Estuary, the St. \n\nAndr\u00e9 and Melides coastal lagoons, atmospheric input and possibly the Sines submarine \n\noutfalls. As a cautionary remark it must be said that the signal from this last source was \n\ntentatively identified in sediment samples collected between 1980 and 1988. Nowadays, \n\nafter considerable improvement of wastewater treatment it is unlikely that contributions \n\nfrom this source can still be detected. In more recent studies by Cardoso &amp; Palma (2007) \n\nand Maretec (2008), no trace metal enrichment was detected in sediments surrounding \n\nthe submarine outfall. \n\nIn general, along the last three decades the decrease of contamination in marine \n\nsediments is expected, given the improvement of new procedures for treatment of \n\nindustrial and domestic effluents and the shutdown of some industries known to discharge \n\ncontaminants into both Tagus and Sado estuaries. The reduction of input of contaminants \n\ninto hydrographic basins and the marine environment should decrease further in the \n\nfuture after the implementations required by the EU-Directive 2000/60/EC (of 23 October \n\n2000), which establishes a framework for the protection of inland surface water, \n\ntransitional water, coastal water and groundwater. \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 245\n\n8.4. Conclusions \n\n \n\nPathways of terrigenous sediment transport on the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf  \n\n\u2022 On the basis of the study of the fine fractions of different sedimentary deposits of the \n\ncontinental shelf it is safe to say that sand deposits on the shelf comprise mature fine \n\nfractions enriched in clay-sized particles while mud deposits have fresher fine \n\nfractions enriched in particles within the \u201csortable silt\u201d range (10-63 \u00b5m). \n\n\u2022 Relatively high contents of terrigenous material are present at the shelfbreak of the \n\nLisbon shelf. The transport of this sediment to the shelfbreak may occur not directly \n\nfrom river plumes issuing from the Tagus estuary but rather by cycles of \n\nresuspension and deposition from the Tagus mud patch. \n\n\u2022 The general southward increase of biogenic carbonate content in sediments of the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal-Sines shelf indicates a southward decrease of terrigenous input from \n\nthe area off the Tagus Estuary towards Cape Sines. \n\n\u2022 On the Lisbon shelf two important sources nourish the shelf with lithogenic fine \n\nsediments: the Tagus estuary and the sea-cliffs between Fonte da Telha beach and \n\nCape Espichel. The Albufeira coastal lagoon most likely contributes also with \n\nlithogenic sediments to the shelf, but its contribution could not be detected in the \n\nmineralogy and geochemistry of surface sediments from the shelf. \n\n\u2022 On the Set\u00fabal shelf contents of lithogenic material are lower than on the Lisbon \n\nshelf. Enhanced concentrations of mineral indicators of riverine sediment input, \n\nhowever, highlight the Sado mud patch and the upper Set\u00fabal Canyon as \n\ndepocentres of terrigenous sediment. Suspended particulate matter coming from the \n\nSado Estuary seems to bypass the sandy deposits of the inner shelf. \n\n\u2022 On the Sines shelf, lithogenic sediment input appears generally low, and as a \n\nconsequence the relative content of biogenic carbonate reaches maximum values in \n\nthis area. Several local sources of lithogenic input can be traced, however, on the \n\ninner shelf: i) the Plio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs present in the southern half of the Tro\u00eda-\n\nSines coastal arc; ii) the Santo Andr\u00e9 and Melides coastal lagoons; iii) the Sines sub-\n\nvolcanic complex. \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 246 \n\n\u2022 Dispersal patterns of mineralogical and geochemical tracers on the inner shelf \n\nbetween Tr\u00f3ia and Sines support a net northward longshore drift of sediments in the \n\nTr\u00f3ia Peninsula and southward drift in the rest of the coastal arc. \n\n \n\nRecent sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and \n\ncomparisons to other environments of the central Portuguese margin \n\n\u2022 Sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by submarine \n\ncanyons and export of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental margin is \n\nrestricted by slope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-slope \n\ntransport. \n\n\u2022 The Nazar\u00e9 Canyon is efficient in transporting sediments down to the lower canyon \n\nwhile in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and probably in the Cascais Canyon the down-\n\ncanyon transport to the lower canyon is very limited, conceivably only triggered by \n\nhigh energy events like high-magnitude earthquakes. \n\n\u2022 Sediment accumulation rates in the upper reaches of the Lisbon, Set\u00fabal and Cascais \n\nCanyon are an order of magnitude higher than rates measured at comparable depths \n\non adjacent slope areas and other parts of the western Iberian margin, indicating \n\nthat these submarine canyons act as sediment depocentres. \n\n\u2022 Sediment input to the upper canyon reaches may result from: i) resuspension of shelf \n\nsediments under influence of storm waves or as a result of internal tidal waves \n\ngenerated on the edges of the canyons and propagating over the adjacent shelf, and \n\nsubsequent advection of suspended matter to the canyon in bottom nepheloid layers; \n\nii) direct input from turbid plumes issuing from nearby estuaries; iii) in the case of \n\nthe Set\u00fabal upper canyon: resuspension of sediments from the slope south of the \n\ncanyon and entrainment with the Mediterranean Outflow Water flowing across the \n\ncanyon. \n\n\u2022 In middle and lower Set\u00fabal Canyon sediment accumulation rates are comparable to \n\nthose of the adjacent open slope, suggesting that this part of the canyon has a much \n\nless active sedimentary regime than the upper canyon, and does not receive major \n\ninput of sediment from either the upper canyon or from the adjacent open slope, \n\napart from the background pelagic input. \n\n\u2022 In the upper Lisbon and Set\u00fabal canyon, tidal currents have a prominent role in \n\nresuspending and transporting fine-grained sediments especially when currents \n\n(measured at one meter above the seabed) exceed the threshold speed of 15-\n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 247\n\n25 cm s-1. In the middle and lower canyon, on the other hand, there is only limited \n\nresuspension from the seabed and sedimentation processes prevail. During the \n\nperiod covered by this study, a particular characteristic of tidal currents in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon is the prevalence of net up-canyon directed flow. Since the strongest \n\ncurrents seem to be also directed up-canyon, it can be assumed that the prevalent \n\ndirection of suspended sediment transport was up-canyon as well. \n\n\u2022 Unlike what is observed in other active canyon systems like the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, the \n\nMonterey Canyon, the Congo Canyon and the Palam\u00f3s Canyon, low frequency and \n\nhigh-energy processes like gravity flows seem to be very rare in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon. The most recent sediment mass transport event detected in the lower \n\ncanyon corresponds to the 1755 earthquake which means that only powerful events \n\nlike such an earthquake are capable of remobilising and transporting sediment down-\n\ncanyon to such water depths. \n\n\u2022 The previous two conclusions explain why the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon (and possibly the Cascais Canyon) presently act as traps for fine-grained \n\nsediments entrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf, without substantial down-\n\ncanyon dispersal to the middle and lower reaches. \n\n \n\nTrace metal enrichment in the central Portuguese margin \n\n\u2022 Bulk composition and trace metal composition of pre-industrial sediments is largely \n\nsimilar for the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Nazar\u00e9 canyons systems. \n\n\u2022 Whereas bulk composition of the sediment has not changed over the last 150 years, \n\npresent-day surface sediments and suspended particulate matter are significantly \n\nenriched in Pb, Zn and Cu compared to pre-industrial sediments. \n\n\u2022 Sediments in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons appear more enriched in trace \n\nmetals than sediments in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, both with regard to trace metal \n\nconcentrations in core top samples as well as to inventories of excess trace metals \n\naccumulated over the last 150 years. The highest levels of enrichment in Pb, Zn and \n\nCu are found in sediment deposits in the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais \n\ncanyons, consistent with their proximity to heavily populated and industrialised areas \n\nof central Portugal as well as to the Tagus River, a major source of pollutant \n\nparticles. Discharge of dredged contaminated sediments in the Lisbon Canyon \n\nappears also as a potentially important source of anthropogenic trace metals. \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 248 \n\n\u2022 In accordance with the overall higher contents of trace metals in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nand Cascais canyons, the anthropogenic signature in lead isotopes appears also more \n\npronounced in the southern area. \n\n\u2022 The role of submarine canyons as trap for particulate material and attached \n\npollutants is confirmed by stronger influence of anthropogenic Pb and Zn compared \n\nto the adjacent open shelf and slope. \n\n\u2022 The dispersal of anthropogenic Pb over the southern area (Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nand adjacent continental shelf) seems to comprise important contributions from \n\natmospheric transport. This is not only evident from the isotopic signature of the \n\npollutant lead in surface sediments which resembles the signature of incinerator fly \n\nashes from industries, but also from the wide spread of Pb enrichment affecting the \n\nentire study area, even in areas where other trace metals, also enriched in the \n\nestuaries, show no enrichment. \n\n\u2022 In the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon system considerably high levels of anthropogenic Pb \n\nand Zn enrichment appear restricted to the upper canyon reaches, decreasing \n\nexponentially further down-canyon. This indicates inefficient down-canyon transport \n\nof sediments in this canyon. \n\n\u2022 Trace metal enrichment in general appears widespread on the Lisbon shelf, whereas \n\non the Set\u00fabal and Sines shelves the areas enriched in trace metals appear more \n\nlimited in extent, and are bounded by areas where pre-industrial concentrations \n\nprevail in surface sediments. \n\n\u2022 Considering the spatial distribution of trace metal enrichment on the shelf and upper \n\nslope from the Tagus estuary to Cape Sines, Pb enrichment is detected in the largest \n\narea, whereas successively smaller areas are affected by enrichment of, respectively, \n\nZn, Cu, Cr, and Ni. Generally, enrichment of trace metals tends to decrease with \n\nincreasing water depth suggesting that the excess of trace metals is mostly derived \n\nfrom land. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 249\n\n8.5. Proposals for future investigations \n\nWhereas the present thesis integrates a large amount of pre-existing and newly-\n\ngenerated data on sediment and trace metal dispersal on the central Portuguese margin, \n\nnew perspectives have emerged that call for further study of particular aspects that \n\ncannot be resolved with the present data. Suggestions for further studies include the \n\nfollowing: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Assessment of the temporal evolution of trace metal contamination through analysis \n\nof sediment cores with high temporal resolution from areas where fresh sediment \n\naccumulates, such as the Tagus mud patch or certain areas within the Tagus estuary \n\nnot affected by dredging activities. Such analysis is very relevant to assess if new \n\nprocedures for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents implemented during the \n\npast 30 years have been effective in reducing trace metal contamination in estuarine \n\nand shelf environments. Application of the EU-Directive 2000/60/EC (of 23 October \n\n2000) is expected to lead to new implementations in the near future which should \n\naffect hydrographic basins in an integrated approach to improve water quality. The \n\nobjective of this Directive is to establish a framework for the protection of inland \n\nsurface water, transitional water, coastal water and groundwater. On the longer run \n\nthe effects of these measures are expected to affect not only the quality of water but \n\nalso the quality of sediments which are known to reflect the overall contamination \n\nlevel of a given ecosystem. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Study of the seasonal and interanual variability of nepheloid layers issuing from the \n\nTagus and Sado estuaries and associated dispersal of fine-grained particulate matter \n\non the shelf. Six cruises conducted between 1993 and 1995 in the framework of the \n\nEU projects OMEX (Ocean Margin Exchange) I and II specifically addressed the \n\nbehaviour of nepheloid layers in this area during winter and summer conditions. \n\nResults concerning the dispersal and deposition of suspended particulate matter \n\nissuing from the above estuaries were treated in Garcia (1997) and resumed and \n\npublished in Jouanneau et al. (1998). According to these authors, however, the \n\nreported results refer to particularly dry years (1993-1995), during which the strong \n\nincrease in water discharge normally observed during winter did not occur. No other \n\nstudies comparing winter and summer conditions have since then been carried out, \n\n\n\n8. Final considerations \n\n 250 \n\nand the composition and dispersal of suspended particulate matter over the shelf off \n\nthe Tagus and Sado estuaries is still basically unknown for typical winter conditions. \n\nTherefore, the true extent of the influence of these rivers over the adjacent margin \n\nfor what concerns input of particulate matter may have been underestimated so far. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Exploration of the interaction of the Mediterranean Outflow Water with the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon and adjacent slope, and its effect on the sedimentary dynamics of \n\nthe canyon. Many studies have demonstrated the important modifications of open \n\nslope circulation where along-slope currents encounter a canyon on their path (e.g. \n\nDurrieu de Madron, 1994; Puig et al., 2000; Petrenko, 2003). The up-canyon flow \n\nobserved at several locations within the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, which drives particle \n\ntransport toward the canyon head rather than down-canyon, may be related to local \n\ndiversions of the along-slope flow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water as it \n\nencounters the canyon. Better understanding of this interaction would be crucial to \n\ncomprehend the functioning of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and its poorly-known \n\necosystems. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Assessment of the extent and environmental impacts of discharge of contaminated \n\nsediments in the Lisbon Canyon. Information on discharge of contaminated \n\nsediments in the Lisbon Canyon was obtained only during the final stage of writing of \n\nthis thesis, so that additional information concerning the type and level of \n\ncontamination in the discharged sediments and the frequency and location of these \n\ndischarges by other entities than the APL (Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Porto de Lisboa) could \n\nnot be accessed nor further evaluated. This subject is not only important to refine \n\nsome of the conclusions of the present thesis, but the potential impact of discharges \n\non canyon ecosystems should also be taken into consideration in view of the role that \n\nthese canyons may play in fostering economically important biological resources. \n\n\n\n 251\n\nReferences: \n\n \n\nA \nAbouchami, W. &amp; Zabel, M.
