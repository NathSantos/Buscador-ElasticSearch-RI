Data on zooplankton, although \n\nessential to correctly assess the state of marine ecosystems, is still lacking for several regions were \n\nthe need for answers is crucial. This work aims at establishing a baseline of knowledge on the \n\nzooplankton communities in the study area and finding relationships between copepod distribution \n\n(beta-diversity) and environmental and spatial factors.  \n\nThe study area was located off the coast of Portugal, limited between 42\u00ba and 35\u00baN and \n\n14\u00ba and 9,5\u00baW. Sampling was conducted on 22 sites using a Bongo net towed from the rear of the \n\nship in a double oblique design until a maximum depth of 215m, and at each site two samples \n\nwere collected, one for biomass quantification and the other for taxonomical identification. \n\nResults showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation on zooplankton \n\nbiomass, MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-diversity, along with spatially \n\nstructured environmental variation, which also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass \n\nshowed the greatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental \n\nvariation), showing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the \n\nenvironmental variables. MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more \n\ncomplex patterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although \n\ncontrary to the general trend, is in accordance with the hypothesis that inter-regional variability is \n\nmore complex than a correlation with Sea Surface Temperature. The establishment of a baseline \n\nof data for our study area on the studied parameters, especially copepods, is probably the most \n\nimportant conclusion. Calanoid copepods were, as expected, dominant throughout the study area, \n\nrepresented by the genus Calanus, and more specifically, Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863).  \n\n\n\n vi \n\n  \n\n\n\n vii \n\nComunidades de zoopl\u00e2ncton no Atl\u00e2ntico Nordeste \u2013 \u00e1guas offshore Portuguesas \n\nRESUMO \n\nO Zoopl\u00e2ncton desempenha um papel fundamental no funcionamento dos ecossistemas, \n\numa vez que representam o interface para a transfer\u00eancia de energia entre os produtores \n\nprim\u00e1rios e os organismos planct\u00edvoros. Apesar de essencial para avaliar o estado dos \n\necossistemas marinhos, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre zoopl\u00e2ncton \u00e9 ainda escassa em v\u00e1rias regi\u00f5es onde \n\nexiste urg\u00eancia em obter respostas. Este trabalho teve como objetivos estabelecer uma base de \n\nconhecimento acerca das comunidades zoopl\u00e2nct\u00f3nicas na \u00e1rea de estudo e procurar rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de cop\u00e9podes (beta-diversidade) e factores ambientais e espaciais. \n\nO estudo desenvolveu-se ao largo da costa de Portugal, entre os 42\u00ba e 35\u00ba Norte e os 14\u00ba \n\ne os 9,5\u00ba Oeste. A amostragem foi realizada em 22 locais, atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma rede \n\nBongo rebocada a partir da traseira do navio num design duplo-obl\u00edquo, atingindo uma \n\nprofundidade m\u00e1xima de amostragem de 215m. Recolheram-se 2 amostras por local, uma para \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de biomassa e outra para identifica\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f3mica. \n\nOs resultados mostraram que os efeitos espaciais, em conjunto com a varia\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental \n\nespacialmente estruturada, s\u00e3o os principais respons\u00e1veis pela varia\u00e7\u00e3o na biomassa de \n\nzoopl\u00e2ncton, composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos GGT e beta-diversidade de cop\u00e9podes. A biomassa mostrou a maior \n\ndepend\u00eancia de efeitos espaciais (com varia\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental espacialmente estruturada), o que \n\nmostra que a biomassa, por si s\u00f3, poder\u00e1 n\u00e3o ser t\u00e3o suscept\u00edvel a oscila\u00e7\u00f5es nas vari\u00e1veis \n\nambientais. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos GGT e a beta-diversidade de cop\u00e9podes mostraram padr\u00f5es de \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o mais complexos, mas a predomin\u00e2ncia dos efeitos espaciais \u00e9 um resultado que, apesar \n\nde contr\u00e1rio \u00e0 tend\u00eancia geral, est\u00e1 de acordo com a hip\u00f3tese de que a varia\u00e7\u00e3o inter-regional \u00e9 \n\nmais complexa do que a simples correla\u00e7\u00e3o com a temperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar. O \n\nestabelecimento de uma base de conhecimento para a \u00e1rea em estudo, especialmente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\naos cop\u00e9podes, \u00e9 provavelmente a conclus\u00e3o mais importante deste trabalho. Os cop\u00e9podes \n\ncalanoides revelaram-se dominantes na \u00e1rea de estudo, representados pelo g\u00e9nero Calanus, mais \n\nespecificamente, pelos Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863). \n\n\n\n viii \n\n  \n\n\n\n ix \n\nINDEX \n\nAcknowledgments ....................................................................................................................... iii\t\n \u00a0\n\nAbstract ....................................................................................................................................... v\t\n \u00a0\n\nResumo ..................................................................................................................................... vii\t\n \u00a0\n\nIndex .......................................................................................................................................... ix\t\n \u00a0\n\nAbbreviations .............................................................................................................................. xi\t\n \u00a0\n\nIndex of Figures ........................................................................................................................ xiii\t\n \u00a0\n\nIndex of Tables ........................................................................................................................... xv\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\nEnvironmental monitoring data collection is essential to correctly assess the current state \n\nof marine ecosystems, but monitoring programs are still lacking in many regions were answers are \n\nseriously needed (Calbet, Atienza, Henriksen, Saiz, &amp; Adey, 2009; Suikkanen et al., 2013). \n\nPhytoplankton and zooplankton dominate the oceans biodiversity, and are both the basal and vital \n\ncomponents of the marine (and freshwater) food chains. Plankton communities can function as \n\n\u201ccanaries-in-a-cage\u201d, accumulating the effects of change in a myriad of parameters, thus reflecting \n\nalterations that a single snapshot cannot capture (Roemmich &amp; Mcgowan, 1995; Suthers &amp; Rissik, \n\n2009). \n\n \n\n1.1 WHAT IS PLANKTON?  \n\nLife had its origins in the oceans about four thousand million years ago, and nowadays \n\nalmost all major taxonomic phyla have at least one representative living there. Plankton comprises \n\nsome of the most evolutionary simplest and numerous life forms in the oceans (although \n\nchordates are also present in plankton), and it forms a taxonomically heterogeneous group of \n\nmicroscopic autotrophs (phytoplankton), animals (zooplankton) and microbes (bacteria, Archaea \n\nand viruses). This definition of plankton is in some ways rather loose, since we often include in it \n\nactive swimmers like jellyfishes (and other gelatinous organisms) and euphasids (krill), that should \n\nbe technically referred as \u201cnekton\u201d (Suthers &amp; Rissik, 2009).  \n\nPhytoplankton is the autotrophic component of the plankton community, photosynthesizing \n\norganisms that inhabit the sunlit layers of the ocean. These single-celled organisms form the basis \n\nof ocean productivity, producing organic compounds (such as sugars and proteins) from carbon \n\ndioxide dissolved in the water, a process called primary production that sustains the aquatic food \n\nweb (Hasle &amp; Sournia, 1978; Suthers &amp; Rissik, 2009). Phytoplankton contains photosynthetically \n\nactive pigments, such as chlorophyll, that give the oceans a range of colors that are used to \n\nindirectly quantify the concentration of chloroplhyl ?, a surrogate for phytoplankton concentration, \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nusing remote sensing technologies such as satellites with specific sensors (eg.: Modis, SeaWifs) \n\n(H\u00e1t\u00fan et al., 2009; Hooker &amp; Esaias, 1993; Ana Picado, Alvarez, Vaz, &amp; Dias, 2013). \n\nThe main target of this thesis, zooplankton, is a community of animals that live adrift in the \n\nwater, which possess an extremely limited capacity to counteract the movements of water (eg.: \n\ncurrents) through swimming. Taxonomically, zooplankton presents a wide range of classification, \n\nranging from the most primitive unicellular organisms (protists) to vertebrates (fish larvae). \n\nRegarding their life cycle, some species spend their entire life suspended in water (eg.: copepods), \n\nwithout contact to solid surfaces (holoplankton), while most benthic invertebrates and fishes \n\nusually have some  early-life phase in which they experience a transitory planktonic life \n\n(meroplankton) (Alcaraz &amp; Calbet, 2009). Zooplankton is present on the world\u2019s oceans as an \n\nenormous variety of organisms, such as cnidarians, amphipods, copepods and ostracods, among \n\nmany others (Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

These grazers represent an essential trophic pathway for the transfer of \n\norganic carbon from phytoplankton to fish (Suthers &amp; Rissik, 2009), and they also contribute to the \n\nnutrient pool via their excretions, fecal pellets that are either recycled within the water column or \n\nused by bottom feeders \n\n \n\n1.2 WHY STUDY ZOOPLANKTON? \n\nZooplankton exists throughout the 1,5 x 109 Km3 of water that form the world\u2019s oceans, \n\nmaking it one of the most ubiquitous association of organisms on earth. Since zooplankton \n\nconstitutes a critical food source for superior trophic levels, like all fish larvae and many \n\ncommercially important planktivorous fish (Roemmich &amp; Mcgowan, 1995), they are the primal \n\ninfluence on structuring pelagic ecosystems (Labat et al., 2009). In effect, zooplankton (along with \n\npelagic nekton) packages planktonic primary production into forms available for marine birds and \n\nmammals, fishes and humans (Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the need for knowledge on \n\nzooplankton has implications for the correct management of fish stocks (McGinty, Power, &amp; \n\nJohnson, 2011) and other activities of economic interest, as well as for the understanding of \n\nmigratory routes taken by threatened cetaceans and their feeding patterns (Durbin et al., 2002). \n\nUnderstanding zooplankton communities and its dynamics is a key component to understand life \n\non our planet (Burkill &amp; Reid, 2010). \n\nZooplankton also plays other key roles, with even deeper implications, has they concern \n\nthe interactions between climate change and ecosystem function (Beaugrand et al., 2002; McGinty \n\net al., 2011; Roemmich &amp; Mcgowan, 1995). Marine zooplankton are important indicators of \n\nenvironmental changes (Schnack-Schiel, Mizdalski, &amp; Cornils, 2010). Considerable changes in \n\nzooplankton phenology have been detected recently, such as increases in the proportion of small-\n\nsized species and young age classes (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Distribution and abundance of \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nzooplankton have also been demonstrating alarming trends, with measured decreases of 80% in \n\nzooplankton volume in some areas in a forty year span (Roemmich &amp; Mcgowan, 1995). Even \n\nthough long time-series are relatively rare, available data shows that zooplankton exhibits range \n\nshifts, in response to global warming, that are among the fastest and largest of any marine or \n\nterrestrial animal group (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Richardson, 2008). The general trend, as for land \n\nanimals, is for zooplanktonic organisms to expand their ranges polewards, as temperatures \n\nincrease. These kinds of shifts in distribution have profound effects on community structures and \n\nfood webs (Beaugrand, Brander, Alistair Lindley, Souissi, &amp; Reid, 2003). Zooplankton also has an \n\nimmeasurable influence in oceanic carbon fluxes, as they are one of the primary mechanisms for \n\nthe transfer of carbon from surface waters to the deeper waters and sediment (Gallienne, Robins, \n\n&amp; Woodd-Walker, 2001). It is extremely important to monitor plankton associations, because \n\nchanges in community structure reflect the adjustment of pelagic ecosystems to modifications in \n\nwater masses, currents and/or atmospheric forcing. Monitoring will provide us a valuable mean of \n\nchecking the well being of marine ecosystems, possibly in several oceanic regions (Beaugrand et \n\nal., 2002). \n\nIn this work, I focused on copepod (subclass Copepoda) biodiversity and biomass, as \n\nzooplankton communities in the study area are dominated by them (Bonnet et al., 2005), \n\nparticularly cyclopoids (order Cyclopoida) and calanoids (order Calanoida) (Goetze &amp; Ohman, \n\n2010; Miyashita, de Melo J\u00fanior, &amp; Lopes, 2009). Copepods also are the most abundant \n\nmulticellular animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects by possibly three orders of magnitude \n\n(Schminke, 2006), thus showing their importance for community structure. Over the last decade \n\nseveral authors have highlighted observed changes in zooplankton distribution and abundance, \n\nspecifically biogeographical shifts of calanoid copepod communities, with warm-water species \n\nshifting northwards, and cold-water species retreating northwards (Beaugrand et al., 2002; \n\nEdwards, Johns, &amp; Beaugrand, 2008). Moreover, even though the warm water species (Calanus \n\nhelgolandicus (Claus, 1863)) is replacing a cold water species (Calanus finmarchicus (Gunnerus, \n\n1770)), the actual total abundance of Calanus is decreasing (Edwards et al., 2008). Even tough \n\nthese shifts have been measured in the northern European waters (north sea and northwards), it \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nhas been so abrupt that similar changes must be considered for other regions, thus validating the \n\nneed of investigation on copepod diversity and abundance in the study area. \n\n \n\n1.3 THE NORTHEAST ATLANTIC \u2013 PORTUGUESE CONTINENTAL AND OFFSHORE \n\nWATERS \n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean of the Earth, with an area of 82 million \n\nkm2. Despite this, the knowledge about the planktonic communities inhabiting it is limited (Calbet \n\net al, 2009), and for some regions, it simply does not exist (McGinty et al, 2011). Specifically on \n\nthe offshore Portuguese waters, the paucity of information is an almost unsurpassable reality. \n\nHitherto, surveys covering Portuguese waters were either located on the coastal upwelling zones \n\nand estuaries (Continental Shelf) (Queiroga, Silva, Sorbe, &amp; Morgado, 2005), or near seamounts \n\n(Martin &amp; Christiansen, 2009). Sea floor topography is complex and heterogeneous in this area, as \n\nit includes the Portuguese continental shelf and several seamounts, canyons and plains. The \n\nnorthern section consists of the Vigo and Andromeda seamounts, the central of the Carvalho \n\nAra\u00fajo through, Estremadura spur and Tagus basin, and the southern of the Gorringe Ridge (which \n\nincludes the Ormonde and Gettysburg peaks, rising less than 50 meters beneath the surface), \n\nAmp\u00e8re seamount and the Horseshoe and Ferradura plains, among other minor structures. The \n\nmost relevant structures of the continental shelf are the Nazar\u00e9, Set\u00fabal and Lagos canyons and \n\nInfante D. Henrique hill. In the continental shelf and coastal areas coastal upwelling is the most \n\nprominent phenomenon in terms of water circulation and dynamics. The northwestern coast of the \n\nIberian Peninsula is the northernmost limit of the Eastern North Atlantic Upwelling System (Ana \n\nPicado et al., 2013), and during the late spring and summer (Peliz, Rosa, Santos, &amp; Pissarra, \n\n2002), the coastal ocean of Portugal is under the influence of northerly winds that drive an \n\noffshore Ekman Transport, forcing the upwelling of subsurface waters, a phenomenon evidenced at \n\nthe surface by cold, less salty and nutrient-rich waters (Figure 2) (Peliz et al., 2002; Sousa, \n\nNascimento, Casimiro, &amp; Boutov, 2008). Extending from June to September, the upwelling effects \n\nextend from the coast up to 250km into the ocean, with upwelling filaments providing a major \n\nshelf-ocean exchange mechanism (Peliz et al., 2002; Sousa et al., 2008). These filaments, \n\n\n\n 8 \n\noffshore oriented and up to 40km wide, transport upwelled waters to the deep ocean (see: Sea \n\nSurface Temperature on Figure 2) and may have different origins (Peliz et al., 2002). Those \n\nanchored to capes are probably related to topographic forcing, and those in areas of smooth \n\ncoastline and bathymetry are probably related to evolution of frontal instabilities (Peliz et al., \n\n2002). However, according to Lemos &amp; Pires (2004), the upwelling regime has been weakening \n\nsince the mid 1940\u2019s, therefore reinforcing the need to study these areas.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Seasonal Sea Surface Temperature and Chla concentration for the summer of 2011 (adapted \nfrom http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3) \n\nIn oceanic waters, five main water masses have been identified, from bottom to top: the \n\nLower Deep Water (LWD), composed mainly of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and flowing \n\nregionally below the 4000m, mainly across the abyssal plains; the North Atlantic Deep Water \n\n(NADW), which flows in various directions 4000 and 2200m; the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), \n\ncirculating regionally towards the southwest between 2200 and 1500m; the Mediterranean \n\nOutflow Water (MOW), located between 1500 and 600m, which flows to the north and west along \n\nthe middle slope around the Iberian margin; and the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW), \n\ncharacterized by a complex circulation pattern involving different currents and directions between \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n600m and the surface, making it one of the most influential water masses, along with the MOW, in \n\nregard to this thesis (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011). The surface circulation is extremely complex, \n\nas depicted in Figure 3, but it is observable that the main currents affecting the surficial circulation \n\nare: the Subarctic Intermediate Water (SAIW); the Atlantic Current (AC); the North Atlantic Current \n\n(NAC); and the Iberian Polar Current (IPC) (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011). Small-scale circulation \n\nis also affected by seamounts. These seamounts may give rise to different kinds of phenomena \n\nand disturbances, like an increase in the speed of sea currents, local upwellings, turbulence, \n\neddies, among others (Roden, 1987). The study area was located off the coast of Portugal, \n\ncontaining coastal, offshore and oceanic waters, limited between 42\u00ba and 35\u00ba in latitude and -14\u00ba \n\nand -9,5\u00ba degrees in longitude (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF THE NORTH-EASTERN ATLANTIC - \n\nPORTUGUESE OFFSHORE WATERS \n\n \n\n3.1 ABSTRACT \n\nZooplankton plays a key role in ecosystem functioning, as they represent the interface for \n\nenergy transfer between primary producers and planktivores. Data on zooplankton, although \n\nessential to correctly assess the state of marine ecosystems, is still lacking for several regions were \n\nthe need for answers is urgent. This work aims at establishing a baseline of knowledge on the \n\nzooplankton communities in the study area and finding relationships between copepod distribution \n\n(beta-diversity) and environmental and spatial factors. The study area was located off the coast of \n\nPortugal, containing coastal, offshore and oceanic waters, limited between 42\u00ba and 35\u00baN and 14\u00ba \n\nand 9,5\u00baW. Results showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation on zooplankton \n\nbiomass, MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-diversity, along with spatially \n\nstructured environmental variation, which also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass \n\nshowed the greatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental \n\nvariation), showing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the \n\nenvironmental variables. MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more \n\ncomplex patterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although \n\ncontrary to the general trend, is in accordance with the hypothesis that inter-regional variability is \n\nmore complex than a correlation with Sea Surface Temperature. The establishment of a baseline \n\nof data for our study area on the studied parameters, especially copepods, is probably the most \n\nimportant conclusion. Calanoid copepods were, as expected, dominant throughout the study area, \n\nrepresented by the genus Calanus, and more specifically, Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n3.2 INTRODUCTION \n\nEnvironmental monitoring data collection is essential to correctly assess the current state \n\nof marine ecosystems, but monitoring programs are still lacking in many regions were answers are \n\nseriously needed (Calbet et al., 2009; Suikkanen et al., 2013). The Atlantic Ocean is the second \n\nlargest ocean of the Earth, with an area of 82 million km2. Despite this, the knowledge about the \n\nplanktonic communities inhabiting it is limited (Calbet et al, 2009), and for some regions, it simply \n\ndoes not exist (McGinty et al, 2011). Specifically on the offshore Portuguese waters, the paucity of \n\ninformation is an almost unsurpassable reality. Hitherto, surveys covering Portuguese waters were \n\neither located on the coastal upwelling zones and estuaries (Continental Shelf) (Queiroga et al., \n\n2005), or near seamounts (Martin &amp; Christiansen, 2009). Data about the core of the Exclusive \n\nEconomic Zone (EEZ) is particularly missing, a no-data region existing between the coastal area \n\nand the area covered by the \u201cPlankton Reactivity in the Marine Environment (PRIME) (Gallienne et \n\nal., 2001) and the \u201cProgram Ocean Multidisciplinaire Meso Echelle (POMME)\u201d (Labat et al., 2009) \n\nlong-term monitoring programs.  \n\nThe biodiversity of marine ecosystems plays a key role in their structure and function. All \n\nthe levels of biodiversity have a strong influence on marine pelagic ecosystems interactions and \n\nprocesses, especially on primary and secondary production, nutrient cycling and trophic transfer \n\n(Johnson et al., 2011). Zooplankton plays a key role in ecosystem functioning, as they are the \n\nmost important secondary producers in oceans and represent the interface for energy transfer \n\nbetween primary producers and planktivores (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Since zooplankton \n\nconstitutes a critical food source for superior trophic levels, like all fish larvae and many \n\ncommercially important planktivorous fish, they are the primal influence on structuring pelagic \n\necosystems (Labat et al., 2009). Zooplankton (along with pelagic nekton) packages planktonic \n\nprimary production into forms available for marine birds and mammals, fishes and humans \n\n(Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the need for knowledge on zooplankton has implications for the \n\ncorrect management of fish stocks (McGinty et al., 2011) and other activities of economic interest, \n\nas well as for the understanding of migratory routes taken by threatened cetaceans and their \n\nfeeding patterns (Durbin et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nZooplankton also plays other key roles, with even deeper implications, has they concern \n\nthe interactions between climate change and ecosystem function (McGinty et al., 2011). \n\nConsiderable changes in zooplankton phenology have been detected recently, such as increases in \n\nthe proportion of small-sized species and young age classes (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Distribution \n\nand abundance of zooplankton have also been demonstrating alarming trends. Even though long \n\ntime-series are relatively rare, available data shows that zooplankton exhibits range shifts, in \n\nresponse to global warming, that are among the fastest and largest of any marine or terrestrial \n\nanimal group (Richardson, 2008). The general trend, as for land animals, is for zooplanktonic \n\norganisms to expand their ranges polewards, as temperatures increase. These kinds of shifts in \n\ndistribution have profound effects on community structures and food webs (Beaugrand et al., \n\n2003). Zooplankton also has an immeasurable influence in oceanic carbon fluxes, as they are one \n\nof the primary mechanisms for the transfer of carbon from surface waters to the deeper waters \n\nand sediment (Gallienne et al., 2001).  \n\nOne of the major focus of research in previous years in the north-eastern Atlantic (North \n\nAtlantic Drift Province) has been the distribution and biomass of zooplankton (especially \n\nmesozooplankton), surveyed in long-term programs such as the \u201cContinuous Plankton Recorder \n\n(CPR) Survey\u201d (Hays, Clark, Walne, &amp; Warner, 2001), \u201cPlankton Reactivity in the Marine \n\nEnvironment (PRIME), \u201cAtlantic Meridional Transect (AMT)\u201d (Gallienne et al., 2001), and the \n\n\u201cProgram Ocean Multidisciplinaire Meso Echelle (POMME)\u201d (Labat et al., 2009). Given the \n\nshortage of information for the Portuguese offshore waters, this study focused on the distribution, \n\nbiodiversity and biomass of zooplankton, namely copepods, as they are the most abundant \n\nmulticellular animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects by possibly three orders of magnitude \n\n(Schminke, 2006). Our main objectives were a) to find relations between zooplankton and copepod \n\ndistribution and diversity and the latitudinal gradient of the western Iberian margin, as the main \n\nsurrogate for the environmental and spatial factors acting in the region, and b) to establish a \n\nbaseline of knowledge on the zooplankton communities along the latitudinal gradient of the study \n\narea, to facilitate a better understanding of global patterns of biodiversity and changes in \n\ncommunity structures. \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n3.3 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nEthics statement \n\nNo permits were required for the described study, and the study did not involve \n\nendangered or protected species. \n\nStudy area \n\nThe sampled area, located off the coast of Portugal, was limited between 42\u00ba and 35\u00baN \n\nand -14\u00ba and -9,5\u00baW, containing coastal, offshore and oceanic waters (Figure 4). Sea floor \n\ntopography is complex and heterogeneous in this area, as it includes the Portuguese continental \n\nshelf and several seamounts, canyons and plains. The northern section consists of the Vigo and \n\nAndromeda seamounts, the central of the Carvalho Ara\u00fajo through, Estremadura spur and Tagus \n\nbasin, and the southern of the Gorringe Ridge (which includes the Ormonde seamount), Amp\u00e8re \n\nseamount and the Horseshoe and Ferradura plains, among other minor structures. The most \n\nrelevant structures of the continental shelf are the Nazar\u00e9, Set\u00fabal and Lagos canyons and Infante \n\nD. Henrique hill (Figure 4).  \n\nSample collection and treatment \n\nSampling was conducted on 22 sites, scattered through the study area according to the \n\nroute of the ship of opportunity where it was performed. Pelagic tows were conducted daily before \n\nsunrise (Cabal, Gonz\u00e1lez-Nuevo, &amp; Nogueira, 2008; Sobrinho-Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Isidro, 2001), between: \n\n25th of July and 8th of August; 8th and 11th of August; and 7th and 13th of September. A Bongo \n\nnet with 60 cm of mouth diameter fitted with a 333 ?m mesh size (Martin &amp; Christiansen, 2009) \n\nwas towed from the rear of the ship in a double oblique design (Varela et al., 2010) until a \n\nmaximum depth of 215 m. Tows extended for an average of 20 minutes (including deployment \n\nand retrieval time), at a velocity between 1,5 and 2 knots (Martin &amp; Christiansen, 2009). Instant \n\ndepth control was carried out with the angle method, and maximum sampling depth and \n\ntemperature at maximum depth (Tdp) were recorded with a Suunto Digital Profundimeter attached \n\nto the net. Total volume of filtered water was measured with two General Oceanics flowmeters (ref. \n\n2030R). Sea Surface Temperature (SST) was recorded using a Hobo Tidbit attached to the net. \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nSamples were taken at each of the sampling sites, with the contents of one cod end being \n\npreserved for taxonomic identification and the other to determine zooplankton biomass. Samples \n\nfor taxonomic identification were preserved in 4% borax-buffered formaldehyde (Gallienne et al., \n\n2001) and for biomass quantification were filtered on the ship onto pre-ashed and weighted glass-\n\nfiber filters and stored at -20\u00aaC (Gallienne et al., 2001). On return to the laboratory, samples for \n\ntaxonomic identification were microscopically analyzed for total counts and identification of major \n\ntaxonomic groups (MTG, adapted from Suthers &amp; Rissik 2009) and copepod diversity (CD \u2013 adult \n\ncopepods were identified to species level, while copepodite stages were identified only to genus \n\nlevel and not considered for this work), after splitting in a Folsom Plankton Splitter (1/2 to 1/32 \n\nratios were used) (Schnack-Schiel et al., 2010). Samples for biomass determination (mg Dry \n\nWeight m-3) were dried at 60\u00baC for 48h (Labat et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Location of the sampling sites. Major geographic structures are: Vigo seamount, Tagus basin, Gorringe \n\nRidge (which includes the Ormonde seamount), Amp\u00e8re seamount and Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal canyons. \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nEnvironmental data \n\nLocal depth (LD) data were obtained from the GEBCO database (General Bathymetric \n\nChart of the Oceans - http://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/online_delivery/gebco/), with a resolution of \n\n1,6km. Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) was obtained from weekly composites matching the \n\nsampling period (l3, 4km resolution) of the MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer, \n\nAqua satellite) (OceanColor - SeaDAS) (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3). \n\nSpatial Variables \n\nSpatial dependence in our study area was modeled using principal coordinates of neighbor \n\nmatrices (PCNM, Borcard &amp; Legendre 2002; Borcard et al. 2004; Dray et al. 2006), a method well \n\nsuited for the detection of spatial trends across a wide range of scales. To start, a Euclidean \n\ndistance matrix among sampling sites was calculated. Then, a truncated connectivity matrix was \n\nbuilt, using a truncation value that was the largest in the minimum spanning tree linking all the \n\nsampling sites (Pierre Legendre &amp; Legendre, 1998). A PCoA (principal coordinate analysis) was \n\nthen performed on the truncated connectivity matrix, in order to extract the eigenvalues and \n\neigenvectors. The eigenvectors with large eigenvalues correspond to large-scale spatial structures, \n\nwhereas the ones with small eigenvalues describe local spatial structures. All of the PCNM \n\neigenvectors are orthogonal and therefore uncorrelated independent variables and were used as \n\nspatial variables in subsequent analysis. PCNM eigenvectors were created with the package \n\n\u201cspacemakeR\u201d (Dray et al., 2006) for the R language (R Core Team 2014). \n\n \n\nStatistical analyses \n\nBiomass values were log (x + 0,001) transformed. Independent variables were \n\ntransformed and standardized using a Box-Cox transformation, in order to guarantee normality and \n\nvariance homogeneity, and to avoid scale effects. Both Major Taxonomic Groups (MTG) and \n\nCopepod Diversity (CD) abundance matrices were transformed using the Hellinger\u2019s distance \n\n(Pierre Legendre &amp; Gallagher, 2001).  We ran forward selection using a multiple linear regression \n\nmodel (P Legendre, 2007) to select the variables, both environmental (Chl a, SST, LD, TDp) and \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nspatial (coordinates; PCNM eigenvectors), which significantly (p &lt;0,05 after 999 random \n\npermutations) contributed to explain the response in biomass variation (Blanchet, Legendre, &amp; \n\nBorcard, 2008). We also ran forward selection, this time using canonical redundancy analysis \n\n(RDA, Legendre &amp; Legendre 1998) to select the variables, environmental and spatial, which \n\nsignificantly (p &lt;0,05 after 999 random permutations) contributed to explain the response in MTG \n\nand CD assemblages. All the sets of variables (environmental, coordinates and PCNM \n\neigenvectors) were used in variation partitioning in order to quantify the proportion of the variation \n\nin biomass, MTG assemblages and CD assemblages, explained by purely environmental, purely \n\nspatial and spatially structured environmental effects (D Borcard, Legendre, &amp; Drapeau, 1992). \n\nPartitioning, for MTG and CD assemblages, was done through a series of partial RDA\u2019s (Pierre \n\nLegendre &amp; Legendre, 1998), and through a series of partial linear regression analyses for \n\nbiomass. The R2 \u2013 values were adjusted (R2a) to account for the number of sampling sites and \n\nexplanatory variables (Peres-Neto, Legendre, Dray, &amp; Borcard, 2006). All statistical analyses were \n\nperformed in R statistical language (R Core Team 2014) using the package \u201cvegan\u201d (Oksanen, \n\nKindt, Legendre, &amp; O\u2019Hara, 2007) for variation partitioning and for the forward selection of \n\nexplanatory variables. Tests were considered significant when the p-value was less than 0,05. \n\n \n\n3.4 RESULTS \n\nEnvironmental variables measured directly and indirectly are displayed in Table 1.

From these, two were selected \n\n(PCNM1 and PCNM12) by the forward selection procedure (R2a = 0,4949). The PCNM \n\neigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., 2004; Daniel Borcard \n\n&amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1 may be interpreted as a broad-scale pattern, while PCNM12 \n\ncorresponds to a fine-scale pattern. PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the \n\ncentral sites, closer to the shore, from the other sites (Figure 5). \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Copepods comprised \n\nmore than 87% of the individuals, followed by cladocerans (>3%) and salps+doliolids (>2%), and \n\nwere the only ubiquitous MTG, but other groups like ostracods, cladocerans, appendicularians, \n\namong others, were also present across the sampling sites. The forward selection procedure \n\nidentified three environmental variables (Figure 7) as significant predictors of variation in MTG \n\nassemblages: Chl a, SST and LD (R2a = 0,3684). The first axis of the RDA model explains 18,5% of \n\nthe variation and contrasts sites with higher Chl a associated with Hyperidae and Copepoda \n\nagainst sites with higher SST, associated with Cladorcerans. The second axis explains 10,4% of the \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nvariation and corresponds to a gradient of sea depth (LD), to which are associated \n\nSalpida+Doliolida and Cnidaria+Ctenophora. Latitude and longitude were also selected by the \n\nprocedure, and explain 31,8% of MTG assemblage variation (R2a = 0,3177).  \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Redundancy analysis triplot showing the association between MTG, study sites and the forward \nselected environmental variables (p &lt;0,05). \n\nA total of 15 PCNM eigenvectors resulted from our spatial model. From these, five were \n\nselected (PCNM1, PCNM2, PCNM3, PCNM5 and PCNM7) by the forward selection procedure (R2a \n\n= 0,527). The PCNM eigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., \n\n2004; Daniel Borcard &amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3 may be \n\ninterpreted as broad-scale patterns, while PCNM5 and PCNM7 correspond to medium-scale \n\n\n\n 31 \n\npatterns (Figure 8). PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the central sites, closer to \n\nthe shore, from the other sites, PCNM2 displays a spatial structure that includes the southernmost \n\nsites, and PCNM3 shows a spatial structure that separates structures in the northernmost part \n\nnearest to the shore from the other sites. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Most of \n\nthis variation (26,9%) corresponded to purely spatial effects (PCNM\u2019s and coordinates), 18% of the \n\nvariation was due to the environmental-spatially structured component, and 8,4% was due to the \n\n\n\n 32 \n\npure environmental component. \n\nFigure 9. Variation of MTG explained by environmental and spatial variables and their shared effects.  \n\nAbundance of copepods varied among sites, and ranged from 4,12 (site 18) to 203,96 ind \n\nm-3 (site 14). We found 44 copepod species, divided by 30 genera, 21 families and 4 orders \n\n(Supplementary Data \u2013 Table 5). Dividing by order, Calanoida accounted for 97,2% of total \n\nabundance, Cyclopoida for 1,35%, Harpacticoida 0,38% and Poecilotomatoida 1,06%. Calanoida \n\nwas the only order represented through all sites, with Calanus being the only ubiquitous genus. \n\nThe dominant species were Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863) (23,19% total abundance), \n\nNannocalanus minor (Claus, 1863) (10,42%), Paracalanus parvus (Claus, 1863) (10,62%) and \n\nTemora stylifera (Dana, 1849) (10,96%). Mean copepod species richness was 16,68 (SD = 4,17), \n\nranging from 29 (site 22) to 10 species (site 16). The forward selection procedure identified three \n\nenvironmental variables (Figure 10) as significant predictors of variation in copepod assemblages, \n\nChl a, SST and LD (R2a = 0,2079). Latitude was also selected by the procedure, as a predictor of \n\nvariation on copepod assemblages (R2a = 0,2078). \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

From these, five were \n\nselected (PCNM1, PCNM2, PCNM3, PCNM6 and PCNM7) by the forward selection procedure (R2a \n\n= 0,3944). The PCNM eigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., \n\n2004; Daniel Borcard &amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3 may be \n\ninterpreted as broad-scale patterns, while PCNM5 and PCNM7 correspond to medium-scale \n\npatterns (Figure 11). PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the central sites closer \n\nto the shore, from the other sites, PCNM2 displays a spatial structure that includes the \n\nsouthernmost sites, and PCNM3 shows a spatial structure that separates a clump of sites in the \n\nnorthernmost part nearest to the shore from the other sites. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \n\nFigure 11. Spatial representation of the selected PCNMs used to build spatial and environmental models \nexplaining CD variation. For the selected PCNMs variables, white circles represent negative scores and \nblack circles represent positive scores. \n\nVariation partitioning revealed that 44,8% of the CD assemblages\u2019 variation could be \n\nexplained by the environmental and the spatial variables (PCNMs and Latitude) recorded (Figure \n\n12). Most of this variation (24,0%) corresponded to purely spatial effects (PCNM\u2019s and \n\ncoordinates), 18,9% of the variation was due to the environmental-spatially structured component, \n\nand only 1,9% was due to the purely environmental component. By further dissecting the variation \n\nexplained by the environmental component, either alone or in conjunction with spatial variation \n\n(20,8%), we found that the unique contribution of LD (8,8%) was the second major contributor to \n\nvariation (Chl a =2,7%; SST=5,4%), and the shared component between SST and Chl a accounted \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nfor the major portion of the environmental variation (10,4%). When dissecting the variation \n\nexplained by spatial variables, either alone or in conjunction with the environment (42,9%), we \n\nfound that the unique contribution (15,7%) of the three forward selected PCNM eigenvectors \n\naccounting for large-scale effects (PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3) was second only to the \n\ncontribution of the shared component between PCNM\u2019s and latitude (16,1%), indicating that the \n\nmajor structures defined by those three selected PCNM\u2019s are responsible, either alone or in \n\nconjunction with another spatial variable (latitude), for the majority of variation that can be \n\nattributed to spatial effects. Fine-scale PCNM eigenvectors (PCNM6 and PCNM7) only accounted \n\nfor 6,5% of the variation. \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Variation of copepod assemblages explained by environmental and spatial variables and their \n\nshared effects.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n3.4 DISCUSSION \n\nZOOPLANKTON BIOMASS \n\nRegarding zooplankton biomass, our average value (4,62 mg DW m-3) is lower than that \n\ndescribed by Labat et al. (2009) for a nearby western area (average of 9,6 mg DW m-3 in \n\nSeptember). However, given the fact that biomasses are in the same order of magnitude and are \n\nalso between the interval published by Gallienne et al. (2001) for similar latitudes (3 to 30 mg DW \n\nm-3), these studies validate our results. The selection of Chl a as a predictor of variation in \n\nzooplankton biomass, which tends to increase as increases the Chl a concentration, corroborates \n\nthe hypothesis that an increase in zooplankton abundance in the same region would be \n\npredictable, as energy was transferred up the food chain (Hays et al., 2001). Our spatial model \n\nalso supports this hypothesis, as PCNM1, which was selected by the forward selection procedure, \n\nrepresents a spatial structure closer to the shore which intimately resembles the distribution of Chl \n\na (Figure 4), and is probably related to distance to shore, acting as a proxy for depth. It is typical \n\nfor shallow shelf areas to show enhancement of primary production and an accompanying \n\nincrease in zooplankton biomass (Ki\u00f8rboe, Munk, Richardson, Christensen, &amp; Paulsen, 1988). The \n\ninfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal Canyons, two submarine canyons, may also be in effect here, \n\nsince canyons are known for their high primary production (Mendes et al., 2011). Regarding \n\nPCNM12, it corresponds to a fine-scale pattern that intends to discriminate the selected sites from \n\nthese in their proximity. Unfortunately, lack of data does not allow us to deeply discuss this result, \n\nwhich might be related to differences in depth, especially in the sites located near the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon (here, the two selected sites -13 and 14 - present the shortest depth in comparison to \n\nnearby sites) and the Ormonde Seamount (sites 7 and 8).  The variation partitioning procedure \n\nrevealed that 47,9% of the biomass variation could be explained by the environmental and spatial \n\nvariables recorded. Most of this variation corresponded to purely spatial effects, which is probably \n\nrelated to the relationship between distance to shore and depth. Spatial variation and spatially \n\nstructured environmental variation are the main drivers behind the differences in zooplankton \n\nbiomass. Thus, it is possible to conclude that spatial variation - trending towards shallower, near to \n\nthe shore areas (intimately connected to chlorophyll) - is fundamental in determining the \n\n\n\n 37 \n\ndistribution of zooplankton in terms of biomass, since that even the Chl a distribution is affected by \n\nthe spatial variation. The coupling of these variables results in what can be described as \n\nconcomitant with coastal upwelling, the oceanic phenomena responsible for areas of high \n\nproductivity near shore, especially for the location and time period of sampling (A. Picado et al., \n\n2014; Rocha, Cordeiro, Nolasco, &amp; Dubert, 2013). \n\n \n\nMTG AND CD ASSEMBLAGES \n\nMTG assemblages are dominated by copepods, an expected result since these small \n\ncrustaceans are ubiquitous in marine waters, and, according to the literature, may reach values of \n\n90% of the total abundance in zooplankton (Bonnet et al., 2005; Gallienne et al., 2001; Labat et \n\nal., 2009). Total abundance of zooplankton in our study was lower than that recorded on other \n\nstudies for nearby areas (POMME 2 and 3 - Labat et al. 2009; PRIME - Gallienne et al. 2001). \n\nThese differences may be due to differences in sampling strategies, or the heterogeneity in space \n\nand time that oceanic systems traditionally present (Hays et al., 2001; Karouby, Iliadis, Durbec, \n\nRiandey, &amp; Carlotti, 2007). For MTG assemblages, Chl a, SST and LD were selected as predictors \n\nof variation by the forward selection procedure, but contrary to the case of biomass, latitude and \n\nlongitude were also selected. These results are explained by the fact that, as opposite to biomass, \n\nwe are now dealing with different taxonomical and functional groups, which have different needs \n\nand constraints regarding their distribution. The major driver behind this selection is copepod \n\n(Copepoda) abundance, since they are the most abundant MTG. For our study area, we found that \n\ncopepod abundance (and consequentially, zooplankton) is majorly influenced by high \n\nconcentrations of Chl a and low SST, results in accordance to the literature (McGinty et al., 2011) \n\nbut that may show a bias to the high abundance of copepods on the central, near-shore sites \n\n(sampled during the upwelling period). Increase in latitude was also selected by the procedure as a \n\nmajor driver in copepod distribution, but this result is probably related to the fact that the sites with \n\nhigher abundance of copepods are located in the central area of our study, thus causing the \n\nexistence of a latitudinal gradient that runs from the southernmost sites to the center of the study \n\narea.  Contrarily to copepods, cladocerans abundance is conditioned by higher SST, which, \n\n\n\n 38 \n\naccordingly to their preference for temperate and warm waters, especially during summer months \n\n(Atienza, Saiz, Skovgaard, Trepat, &amp; Calbet, 2008; Johns, Edwards, Greve, &amp; SJohn, 2005; \n\nMollmann, Koster, Kornilovs, &amp; Sidrevics, 2002), was an expected result. Cladocerans show a \n\nclear preference for southern zones on our study area, as demonstrated by abundance peaks in \n\nsites 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Supplementary Data \u2013 Table 4). Another result of the procedure is that \n\nthe abundance of the group Salpida+Doliolida (salps and doliolids) is associated with higher values \n\nof LD and increasing longitude. PCNM1 represents a spatial structure closer to the shore, which \n\nintimately resembles the distribution of Chl a (Figure 4), and has the highest values of abundance. \n\nThis result is similar to that of biomass, and, as discussed above, is probably related to distance to \n\nshore. The sites selected for PCNM1 display high abundances, especially copepods. Since \n\ncopepods are usually accountable for the majority of the biomass in zooplankton (Gallienne et al. \n\n2001; Labat et al. 2009; Bonnet et al. 2005; our results), it is suitable that the influence of \n\ncanyons and coastal upwelling, for reasons already discussed, may be responsible for this result. \n\nPCNM2 represents a cluster of sites showing a clear separation between north and south. Looking \n\ndeeper into the MTG data we found that at least 70% of the abundance of ostracods, cladocerans, \n\npolychaeta larvae, chaetognaths and pteropods is concentrated on these sites. These sites show \n\nhigh LD (with the exception of site 6, one of the less significant) and high SST, implying that the \n\nreferred MTGs, in our study area, display a preference for warmer, deeper oceanic waters. The \n\nvariation partitioning procedure for MTGs revealed that 53,3% of variation in the composition of the \n\ngroups could be explained by the environmental and spatial variables recorded. As in the case of \n\nbiomass, the procedure revealed that MTG composition patterns were mainly determined by purely \n\nspatial variation (26,9%), which, again, is probably related to the relationship between distance to \n\nshore and depth. In addition to the spatial component, the shared environment-space component \n\naccounted for a significant part of variation in MTG composition (18%). The purely environmental \n\ncomponent had a positive score of 8,4% (Chl a+LD+SST), showing that these environmental \n\nvariables, by themselves, show some weight in shaping the composition of the different MTG. A \n\nrelatively high proportion of the variation (46,7%) in MTG composition was undetermined, which is \n\npartly due to the fact that marine systems are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in \n\nspace and time (Hays et al., 2001; Karouby et al., 2007) - and the sampling we performed \n\nprovides only a snapshot of the communities - but it probably also includes variation caused by \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nunmeasured environmental variables. \n\nRegarding copepod assemblages (CD), these were dominated by the genus Calanus, \n\nrepresented by Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863). This species, typical of a pseudo-oceanic \n\ntemperate species association (Beaugrand et al., 2002), usually shows a higher abundance along \n\nshelf-edges, which is in accordance with the high abundance values we found for sites 11 and 14.  \n\nAccording to the forward selection procedure, Chl a, SST, LD and longitude are significant \n\npredictors of variation on copepod assemblages. Analyzing Figure 10, the most striking features \n\nare the association of Candacia simplex with increasing SST, Calanus heldolandicus with higher \n\nvalues of LD and, on the other end of the axis, Candacia armata, associated with lower values of \n\nLD. For C. armata this result matches with its ecological characteristics, since this species \n\nabundance is typically related to shelf edges, areas of lower depth than oceanic areas (Beaugrand \n\net al., 2002). Regarding C. helgolandicus, this result is probably more related to its ubiquitous \n\ndistribution, this way showing a bias to deeper waters, although high abundance values were \n\nindeed recorded for areas with great depth (sites 8 an 9, located near the Ormonde seamount). C. \n\nsimplex also had its abundance peaks in sites 8 and 9, but this preference for warmer waters is \n\nnot described in the literature. Latitude was also selected by the procedure, indicating that only \n\nlatitude, not longitude, was significant as a predictor of variation on copepod assemblages (R2a = \n\n0,2078). This result may be indicative of the existence of a latitudinal gradient.  When conjugating \n\nthis result with our spatial model, PCNM2 is in agreement with this result. If PCNM1 shows a \n\ncluster of sites in the central area of the map, PCNM2 displays a clear separation between north \n\nand south sites, and PCNM3 a cluster of northern, nearer to shore sites. This means that there are \n\nbroad-scale spatial gradients in action (Latitude+PCNM1-3), and inside these gradients fine-scale \n\nvariation is also present (PCNM6,7). When we look into copepod assemblage data, it is possible to \n\noffer hypothesis on the clustering present in PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3. PCNM1 clusters sites \n\nnear to the shore, in the upwelling zone, and these sites show high abundances of species that \n\ntypically prefer phytoplankton rich waters, like Calanoides carinatus (Kroyer, 1849), C. \n\nhelgolandicus and Oncaea media (Giesbrecht, 1891), and species that prefer coastal waters, like \n\nEuterpina acutifrons (Dana, 1847) and Ditrichocorycaeus anglicus (Lubbock, 1857) (Cabal et al., \n\n2008). PCNM2 divides sites between north and south, and this division is probably related to \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nwarmer waters, an hypothesis reinforced by the presence of T. stylifera, a species typical of \n\nsubtropical and Mediterranean waters (Cabal et al., 2008). PCNM3 aggregated sites that display \n\nhigh relative abundances (dominant species in sites 2, 15 and 17) of Centropages typicus (Kr\u00f8yer, \n\n1849), Paracalanus parvus (Claus, 1863) and Nannocalanus minor (Claus, 1863), species that \n\ndisplay a neritic character, although they also appear in oceanic waters (Vives &amp; Shmeleva, 2006), \n\nand this may be a signal of the influence of depth.  Medium and fine-scale PCNM\u2019s represent \n\nspatial variation, but the data available does not allow the presentation of hypothesis.  \n\nWe focused on investigating the determinants of beta diversity patterns in our study area \n\nby partitioning the variation of copepod assemblages\u2019 composition between environmental and \n\nspatial factors. A considerable proportion of the variation (44,8%) of copepod assemblage \n\ncomposition was determined by environmental (Chl a, LD, SST) and spatial variables (PCNM 1, \n\n2,3,6,7 and Latitude). Almost all of this variation (42,9%) is due to spatial variation (environmental \n\nstructured plus the spatial component alone) and the contribution of pure environmental effects \n\nwas negligible (1,9%). Regarding the environmental variation (alone and spatially structured), it is \n\npossible to detect a synergistic effect between Chl a and SST that is responsible for 18,5% of \n\nvariation. This result is on agreement with the hypothesis that SST is one of the major drivers of \n\nvariation in copepod community structure (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Suikkanen et al., 2013). \n\nDespite this, for our study area we discovered that spatial variation is the major driver. Spatial \n\nvariation, namely large-scale (PCNM1-3) effects and latitude are responsible for 35,2% of variation. \n\nThis result is in agreement with the findings of McGinty et al. (2011), who stated that local \n\nconditions are important and that inter-regional variability is not simply a reflection of \n\nenvironmental forcing correlated with SST. The elevated percentages of unexplained variation \n\n(52,1% on biomass; 46,7% on MTG; 55,2% on copepod beta-diversity) suggest some caution when \n\nreading into the results, but this only states the importance of continuing this type of studies, in \n\norder to suppress the paucity of information on the theme. Non-measured variables, like salinity \n\nand oxygen, and a stronger interpretation of oceanographic phenomena are also probably lacking \n\nfrom our study. \n\n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nIn conclusion, our study showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation \n\non zooplankton biomass, MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-diversity. Spatially \n\nstructured environmental variation also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass showed the \n\ngreatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental variation), \n\nshowing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the \n\nenvironmental variables. MTG composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more complex \n\npatterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although contrary to \n\nthe general trend (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Suikkanen et al., 2013), is in accordance with the \n\nhypothesis that inter-regional variability is more complex than a correlation with SST (McGinty et \n\nal., 2011). Finally, establishment of baseline data for our study area for the studied parameters \n\n(especially copepod richness) is also a valuable contribution that this study provides for the \n\nscientific and managing community. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n  \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES \n\nThe major point of this thesis is that, for our study area, spatial variation is the primary \n\ndriver of variation on zooplankton biomass, MTG assemblages\u2019 composition and copepod beta-\n\ndiversity. However, the elevated percentages of unexplained variation (52,1% on biomass; 46,7% \n\non MTG; 55,2% on copepod beta-diversity) suggest some caution when reading into the results, but \n\nthis only states the importance of continuing this type of studies, in order to suppress the paucity \n\nof information on the theme. The census performed in this study provides data on species richness \n\nand diversity for areas where, before, data was lacking or was severely incomplete. \n\nAnnual repetition of this kind of campaigns should be a focus of monitoring programs, but \n\nsince these are lacking for the studied area, a monitoring procedure will be outlined in the \n\nfollowing areas, functioning as an idea for the future. After experimenting sampling with a towable \n\nnet (a bongo net), a simpler, more effective method could be the use of a Optical Plankton Counter \n\n(OPC) (Gallienne et al., 2001). The OPC, although a considerable investment, provides huge \n\namounts of data, since it can be constantly sampling water (superficial and deep). Vertical net \n\nsamples would be needed for calibration of the device, taxonomical characterization and biomass \n\ndetermination. Sampling of water for determination of chlorophyll (or phytoplankton) content, \n\ntemperature, salinity and oxygen would provide a great set of environmental data. When sampling \n\nwith the vertical net, the use of a CTD would also be useful to gather a picture of the thermocline \n\nin the study area. Sampling could be conducted using line transects, starting at the inner limit of \n\nthe continental shelf and finishing at the 13\u00baW (similar to our study). Line transects could be \n\nparallel to the equator, starting at 42\u00baN and finishing at 34\u00baN, with 2\u00ba between them, in order to \n\nencompass all our study area. If possible, sampling a larger area would also be a great project.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n  \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.
