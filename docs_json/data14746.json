Obten\u00e7\u00e3o de SNPs, rea\u00e7\u00e3o do feijoeiro comum \n\u00e0 ferrugem da soja e piramida\u00e7\u00e3o de genes de resist\u00eancia a Uromyces \nappendiculatus. Orientador: Everaldo Gon\u00e7alves de Barros. Co-\nOrientadores: Maurilio Alves Moreira, Jos\u00e9 Eust\u00e1quio de Sousa Carneiro e \nCosme Dami\u00e3o Cruz. \n\n \n\n \n\nEste trabalho apresenta resultados de pesquisas desenvolvidas no \u00e2mbito do \n\nPrograma de Melhoramento do Feijoeiro conduzido na Universidade Federal \n\nde Vi\u00e7osa (UFV), sendo este composto por se\u00e7\u00f5es ou subprojetos distintos.  \n\nDesta forma, optou-se por redigi-lo na forma de artigos cient\u00edficos, sendo um \n\nde revis\u00e3o e quatro de resultados originais, os quais j\u00e1 foram ou ser\u00e3o \n\nsubmetidos para publica\u00e7\u00e3o em peri\u00f3dicos internacionais. Por esse motivo, \n\ndecidiu-se por escrev\u00ea-los no idioma ingl\u00eas, em congru\u00eancia com as Normas \n\nde Reda\u00e7\u00e3o de Teses e Disserta\u00e7\u00f5es da UFV. Os resumos de tais artigos \n\ncontendo suas justificativas, seus objetivos e principais resultados s\u00e3o \n\napresentados a seguir: 1) Identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de SNPs (Single Nucleotide \n\nPolymorphisms) no feijoeiro \u2013 SNPs, diferen\u00e7as de um \u00fanico nucleot\u00eddeo ou \n\npequenas inser\u00e7\u00f5es/dele\u00e7\u00f5es (indels) entre fragmentos hom\u00f3logos de DNA,  \n\nforam identificados no feijoeiro (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) por meio do re-\n\nsequenciamento de STSs (Sequence-Tagged Sites) gerados por primers \n\ndesenhados para amplificar sequ\u00eancias shotgun e BAC-end de soja e regi\u00f5es \n\ng\u00eanicas e microssat\u00e9lites de feij\u00e3o. Os fragmentos de DNA contendo SNPs \n\nforam identificados em produtos de PCR (bandas \u00fanicas de DNA) obtidos a \n\npartir de seis linhagens de feij\u00e3o, tr\u00eas de origem Andina (\u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019, \n\n\u2018G19833\u2019 e \u2018AND 277\u2019) e tr\u00eas de origem Mesoamericana (\u2018BAT93\u2019, \u2018DOR \n\n364\u2019 e \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019). O tamanho final do alinhamento das sequ\u00eancias de DNA \n\nobtidas foi de 134.653 pb, onde foram identificados 677 SNPs, incluindo 555 \n\nmudan\u00e7as de base (295 transi\u00e7\u00f5es e 260 transvers\u00f5es) e 122 indels.  Verificou-\n\n\n\n \n\n xi\n\nse uma frequ\u00eancia de 5,16 SNPs/kb. A diversidade nucleot\u00eddica m\u00e9dia \n\nexpressa pelo coeficiente teta de Halushka foi de 0,00226. Este trabalho \n\nrepresenta um esfor\u00e7o pioneiro para a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de SNPs no feijoeiro.  2) \n\nResist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem asi\u00e1tica da soja no feijoeiro \u2013 A incid\u00eancia da ferrugem \n\nasi\u00e1tica da soja (FAS), incitada pelo fungo Phakopsora pachyrhizi, tem sido \n\nconstatada em cultivares de feij\u00e3o. Neste trabalho, 44 acessos de feijoeiro \n\nforam testados para resist\u00eancia ao P. pachyrhizi. Entre estes estavam inclu\u00eddas \n\nfontes de resist\u00eancia a diferentes doen\u00e7as do feijoeiro, cultivares comerciais \n\ndos grupos carioca, preto e vermelho, e linhagens avan\u00e7adas desenvolvidas \n\npelo programa de melhoramento do BIOAGRO/UFV. Foram identificadas 14 \n\nfontes de resist\u00eancia. \u2018PI181996\u2019, \u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019 e \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019 apresentaram \n\nos menores graus m\u00e9dios de rea\u00e7\u00e3o ao pat\u00f3geno. A heran\u00e7a da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 \n\nFAS no acesso \u2018PI181996\u2019 foi estudada e os resultados indicam que esta \n\ncaracter\u00edstica \u00e9 monog\u00eanica e dominante.  3) Melhoramento do feijoeiro para \n\nresist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem no BIOAGRO/UFV, Brasil \u2013 O feijoeiro \u00e9 uma cultura \n\nde reconhecida import\u00e2ncia social, nutricional e econ\u00f4mica.  No entanto, \n\nquando comparada a outras esp\u00e9cies leguminosas de interesse agron\u00f4mico, sua \n\nprodutividade m\u00e9dia ainda \u00e9 considerada baixa. Um dos fatores que explicam \n\nesta situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o grande n\u00famero de doen\u00e7as que acometem o feijoeiro e \n\ncausam danos severos. Entre elas destaca-se a ferrugem, incitada pelo fungo \n\nUromyces appendiculatus, o qual apresenta alta variabilidade. O controle da \n\nferrugem por meio do uso de cultivares resistentes \u00e9 uma estrat\u00e9gia vi\u00e1vel, \n\necon\u00f4mica e de f\u00e1cil ado\u00e7\u00e3o, a ser usada de forma integrada \u00e0s outras pr\u00e1ticas. \n\nNeste trabalho s\u00e3o apresentadas importantes informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a doen\u00e7a, al\u00e9m \n\nde relevantes iniciativas de melhoramento visando o desenvolvimento de \n\ncultivares resistentes \u00e0 ferrugem no BIOAGRO/UFV.  4) Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ngene de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem presente na cultivar de feijoeiro \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, \n\na principal fonte de resist\u00eancia usada no Brasil \u2013 A identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de novas fontes de resist\u00eancia (R) constituem etapas \n\nfundamentais para os programas de melhoramento que visam ao \n\ndesenvolvimento de cultivares com resist\u00eancia efetiva a pat\u00f3genos. A cultivar \n\n\n\n \n\n xii\n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, de origem Mesoamericana, \u00e9 a principal fonte de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 \n\nferrugem utilizada no Brasil.  No entanto, seu gene R (Ur-ON) ainda n\u00e3o foi \n\ncompletamente caracterizado em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a outros j\u00e1 identificados. Neste \n\ntrabalho, inicialmente, \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 e linhagens portadoras de genes R j\u00e1 \n\ncaracterizados foram inoculadas com nove ra\u00e7as de U. appendiculatus.  Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, o DNA de todas as linhagens de feij\u00e3o foi analisado com marcadores \n\nmoleculares ligados a Ur-ON, visando identificar evid\u00eancias adicionais para a \n\npresen\u00e7a de alelos para esse l\u00f3cus nas fontes R.  Finalmente, foi testada a \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o al\u00e9lica entre Ur-ON e os genes de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem presentes nas \n\nlinhagens que foram resistentes a pelo menos uma das ra\u00e7as do pat\u00f3geno.  \n\nTestes de alelismo entre \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 e importantes fontes de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 \n\nferrugem no Brasil, as quais possuem genes R n\u00e3o caracterizados, foram \n\ntamb\u00e9m realizados. Os resultados indicam que o gene de efeito principal que \n\ncondiciona resist\u00eancia ao U. appendiculatus na cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 \u00e9 \n\ndistinto daqueles com os quais ele foi comparado.  5) Melhoramento do \n\nfeijoeiro assistido por marcadores moleculares visando \u00e0 piramida\u00e7\u00e3o de genes \n\nde resist\u00eancia \u00e0 ferrugem \u2013 A piramida\u00e7\u00e3o de genes R assistida por \n\nmarcadores moleculares foi usada pelo programa de melhoramento do \n\nfeijoeiro conduzido no BIOAGRO/UFV como uma estrat\u00e9gia para acelerar o \n\ndesenvolvimento de linhagens com resist\u00eancia dur\u00e1vel e de amplo espectro \u00e0 \n\nferrugem. Os genes Ur-5 (\u2018Mexico 309\u2019), Ur-11 (\u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019) e Ur-ON \n\n(\u2018Vi-4899\u2019, linhagem do tipo carioca derivada do cruzamento \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Ouro \n\nNegro\u2019) foram combinados na cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019, a qual possui gr\u00e3os do tipo \n\ncarioca. Foram obtidas linhagens apresentando todas as marcas moleculares \n\nassociadas aos genes R, as quais confirmaram-se resistentes quando \n\ninoculadas com ra\u00e7as espec\u00edficas de U. appendiculatus.

SNP discovery, reaction of the common bean to \nsoybean rust, and pyramiding of resistance genes to Uromyces \nappendiculatus. Advisor: Everaldo Gon\u00e7alves de Barros. Co-Advisors: \nMaurilio Alves Moreira, Jos\u00e9 Eust\u00e1quio de Souza Carneiro, and Cosme \nDami\u00e3o Cruz. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe present work reports results from researches developed at the Common \n\nBean Breeding Program of the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa (UFV). It is \n\ncomposed by distinct sectors or sub-projects.  We have decided to write it in \n\nthe format of scientific papers; one of them is a paper review and the other \n\nfour articles are original reports. They either have been submitted or will be \n\nsubmitted for publication in international refereed journals. For this reason, we \n\nhave decided to write them in English, according to the Thesis and \n\nDissertations Writing Standards from UFV. Abstracts of these articles \n\ncontaining their justifications, objectives, and main results are presented \n\nbelow:  1) Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovery in the common \n\nbean \u2013 SNPs were discovered in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) via \n\nresequencing of sequence-tagged sites (STSs) developed by PCR primers \n\ndesigned to soybean shotgun and BAC-end sequences, and to common bean \n\ngenes and microsatellite flanking regions. DNA fragments harboring SNPs \n\nwere identified in single amplicons from six contrasting P. vulgaris genotypes \n\nof the Andean (\u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019, \u2018G19833\u2019, and \u2018AND277\u2019) and Mesoamerican \n\n(\u2018BAT 93\u2019, \u2018DOR 364\u2019, and \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019) gene pools.  In the 131,120 bp of aligned \n\nsequence, a total of 677 SNPs were identified, including 555 single-base \n\nchanges (295 transitions and 260 transversions) and 122 small nucleotide \n\ninsertions/deletions (indels).  The frequency of SNPs was 5.16 SNPs/Kb and \n\nthe mean nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka\u2019s theta was 0.00226.  \n\nThis work represents one of the pioneer efforts aiming to detect SNPs in P. \n\n\n\n \n\n xiv\n\nvulgaris.  2) Resistance to soybean rust in the common bean \u2013 Soybean rust \n\n(SBR) incited by Phakopsora pachyrhizi has been reported in common bean \n\ncultivars. In this work a set of 44 P. vulgaris genotypes were tested for \n\nresistance to P. pachyrhizi including resistance sources to several fungal \n\ncommon bean diseases, carioca-type, black-type and red-type Brazilian \n\ncommercial cultivars, and advanced lines developed by the BIOAGRO/UFV \n\nbreeding program. Fourteen resistance sources to P. pachyrhizi were \n\nidentified.  \u2018PI 181996\u2019, \u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019, and \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019 presented the lowest \n\nmean scores of disease reaction.  The inheritance of SBR resistance in \n\n\u2018PI181996\u2019 was studied and the results support the hypothesis that this \n\nresistance is monogenic and dominant.  3) Breeding for common bean rust \n\nresistance in the BIOAGRO/UFV, Brazil \u2013 Common bean is an economically, \n\nnutritionally, and socially important crop.  Unfortunately, compared to other \n\nimportant grain legumes common bean yields are quite low.  One of the \n\nseveral factors contributing to this situation is the high number of destructive \n\ndiseases that attack P. vulgaris and cause serious damage to the crop.  Among \n\nthem is bean rust, incited by the highly variable fungus Uromyces \n\nappendiculatus.  Bean rust control by plant resistance is an easy and \n\neconomical strategy to be used in association to other rust management \n\npractices.  This review presents an overview about the bean rust and reports \n\nsome breeding initiatives aiming at the development of rust resistant cultivars \n\nin the BIOAGRO/UFV.  4) Characterization of the rust resistance gene present \n\nin the common bean cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, the main rust resistance source \n\nused in Brazil \u2013 Identification and characterization of new resistance sources \n\nare basic steps for plant breeding programs aiming to develop modern \n\ncultivars with effective resistance to pathogens.  The Mesoamerican black \n\nseeded common bean cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 is the main rust resistance (RR) \n\nsource used in Brazil, but its resistance gene (Ur-ON) has not been fully \n\ncharacterized yet.  Here we have compared the RR spectrum presented by \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 with those of other bean lines harboring known RR genes when \n\ninoculated with nine races of U. appendiculatus.  In addition, all bean lines \n\n\n\n \n\n xv\n\nwere screened with molecular markers linked to Ur-ON aiming to identify \n\nadditional evidence for the presence of alleles for this locus in the screened \n\nRR sources.  Finally, we tested the allelic relationships of Ur-ON with already \n\ncharacterized RR genes from lines resistant to at least one race of the \n\npathogen.  We also accomplished allelism tests between \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \n\nimportant RR sources in Brazil harboring unnamed RR genes. The results \n\nshowed that the major dominant gene conditioning RR in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 is \n\npositioned at a locus distinct from those with which it was compared.  5) DNA \n\nmarker-assisted breeding aiming rust resistance gene pyramiding in the \n\ncommon bean \u2013 In our common bean breeding program we used a gene \n\npyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers aiming to develop bean lines \n\nwith durable and ample resistance spectrum to rust. The RR genes Ur-5 (from \n\n\u2018Mexico 309\u2019), Ur-11 (from \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019), and Ur-ON (from \u2018Vi-4899\u2019, \n\na carioca seeded line derived from the cross \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019) were \n\ncombined in the carioca-type bean cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019.  Carioca seeded beans are \n\nthe most consumed in the Brazilian market.  We were able to select lines \n\npresenting all the DNA markers associated to the genes of interest and \n\nresistant to all of the specific isolates of U. appendiculatus which were tested.  \n\nThey were also resistant under field conditions.  Yield evaluations show that \n\nthese selected lines are as productive as the recurrent parent \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 and other \n\nhigh performance cultivars currently grown in Brazil. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 1\n\n Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Discovery in the \n\nCommon Bean \n \n\n \n\nAbstract:  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered in \n\ncommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) via resequencing of sequence-tagged \n\nsites (STSs) developed by PCR primers designed to soybean shotgun and \n\nBAC-end sequences, and to common bean genes and microsatellite flanking \n\nregions.  DNA fragments harboring SNPs were identified in single amplicons \n\nfrom six contrasting P. vulgaris genotypes of the Andean (\u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019, \n\n\u2018G19833\u2019, and \u2018AND277\u2019) and Mesoamerican (\u2018BAT 93\u2019, \u2018DOR 364\u2019, and \n\n\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019) gene pools.  These genotypes are the parents of three common bean \n\nRIL mapping populations.  From an initial set of 1,880 PCR primer pairs \n\ntested, 265 robust STSs were obtained, amplified and sequenced in each one \n\nof the six common bean genotypes.  In the resulting 131,120 bp of aligned \n\nsequence, a total of 677 SNPs were identified, including 555 single-base \n\nchanges (295 transitions and 260 transversions) and 122 small nucleotide \n\ninsertions/deletions (indels).  The frequency of SNPs was 5.16 SNPs/Kb and \n\nthe mean nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka\u2019s theta was 0.00226.  \n\nThis work represents one of the pioneer efforts aiming to detect SNPs in P. \n\nvulgaris.  The SNPs identified are an important resource to common bean \n\ngeneticists for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) discovery, marker-assisted \n\nselection and for map-based cloning.  They will be also useful for diversity \n\nanalysis and microsynteny studies among legume species. \n\n \n\nKey words:  DNA polymorphisms \u2013 genome variations \u2013 molecular markers \n\n\u2013 PCR primers \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris \u2013 sequence tagged sites \n\n\n\n \n\n 2\n\n1.  Introduction \n\n \n\nCommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume directly \n\nused as a human food, is grown and consumed worldwide but mainly in \n\ndeveloping countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  It is largely a \n\nsubsistence crop used as a major source of dietary protein in these countries, \n\nas complement to carbohydrate-rich sources such as rice, maize, and cassava.  \n\nThe common bean is also an important source of minerals, i.e., iron and zinc, \n\nand of certain vitamins (Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). \n\nEfficient molecular tools for genetic studies in the common bean are \n\nstill greatly needed.  Single DNA base differences between homologous DNA \n\nfragments and small nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) \u2013 collectively \n\nreferred as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) \u2013 are highly desirable as \n\nmolecular markers because they can be used for in-depth genetic analysis.  \n\nSNPs provide a rich source of DNA polymorphisms in eukaryotic species \n\nbecause they are an abundant form of genome variation.  SNPs are \n\ndistinguished from rare genome variations by a requirement that the least \n\nabundant allele has to present a frequency of 1% or more (Brookes 1999; \n\nAvise 2004). \n\nSNPs can be used as biallelic and codominant DNA markers for a \n\nvariety of tasks in crop improvement including genes and quantitative trait loci \n\n(QTL) discovery, assessment of genetic diversity, association analysis, and \n\nmarker-assisted selection.  SNP markers have two main advantages over other \n\nmolecular markers: (i) they are the most abundant form of genetic variation \n\nwithin genomes (Zhu et al. 2003), and (ii) a wide array of technologies have \n\nnow been developed for high throughput SNP analysis (Fan et al. 2006).  In \n\naddition, SNPs are less unstable than simple sequence repeats (SSR) or \n\nmicrosatellite markers because they present lower mutation rate.  For this \n\nreason, SNPs are useful for population genetics and phylogeny studies (Jin et \n\nal. 2003).  Another relevant characteristic of the SNP markers is that they can \n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nbe transferred between closely related species and utilized for microsynteny \n\nanalysis. \n\nLarge numbers of SNP markers are currently available for many plant \n\nspecies including Arabidopsis thaliana (Jander et al. 2002; Schmid et al. 2003, \n\n2005; Nordborg et al. 2005), maize (Zea mays L.) (Tenaillon et al. 2001; \n\nChing et al. 2002; Wright et al. 2005), rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Feltus et al. \n\n2004), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (Kanazin et. al. 2002; Rostoks et al. \n\n2005), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) (Hamblin et al. 2004), soybean (Glycine \n\nmax L.) (Zhu et al. 2003; Choi et al. 2007), sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) \n\n(Schneider et al. 2001), poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. &amp; Gray) (Tuskan et \n\nal. 2006), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) (Chagn\u00e9 et al. 2008), and Vitis spp. \n\n(Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2008).  SNPs have also been detected in the common bean.  \n\nIn a recent work, Gait\u00e1n-Sol\u00eds et al. (2008) conducted a sequence analysis of \n\n10 genotypes of cultivated and wild Mesoamerican and Andean beans.  A total \n\nof 20,964 bp were analyzed and compared, resulting in the discovery of 372 \n\nSNPs in 41 distinct STSs from coding and noncoding regions of common bean \n\nDNA sequences obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and \n\ngenerated by degenerate oligonucleotide primers (DOP). \n\nMore than 20,000 SNPs have been discovered in soybean by sequence \n\nanalysis and comparison of sequence tagged sites (STSs) from a small set of \n\ndiverse genotypes.  An initial phase of a large-scale soybean SNP discovery \n\neffort resulted in the identification of 5,551 SNPs (Zhu et al. 2003; Choi et al. \n\n2007).  Since then, approximately 12,000 additional soybean SNPs have been \n\nidentified using the same approach (unpublished data).  Because of the \n\nrelatively close relationship between soybean and common bean (Zhu et al. \n\n2005), it has been reported that many of the soybean-derived STS primers \n\nwould be useful to amplify single amplicons in the common bean genome. \n\nIn this work we used available PCR primers designed to amplify \n\nsoybean shotgun and BAC-end sequences for SNP discovery in common bean.  \n\nThis approach aimed to save time and money spent in the initial steps of \n\nprimer development.  In addition, we also used available PCR primers \n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\ndesigned to common bean microsatellite flanking regions.  As reported by Zhu \n\net al. (2003), a higher amount of polymorphism is present in non-coding DNA.  \n\nFor this reason, microsatellite regions could be a good source of SNPs.  \n\nFinally, we also used PCR primers designed to specific P. vulgaris genes. \n\n \n\n2.  Material and Methods \n\n \n\n2.1.  Plant material and DNA extraction \n\nSix contrasting Andean (\u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019, \u2018G19833\u2019, and \u2018AND277\u2019) and \n\nMesoamerican (\u2018BAT 93\u2019, \u2018DOR 364\u2019, and \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019) common bean lines were \n\nused for SNP discovery.  These lines are the parents of three common bean \n\nRIL mapping populations: \u2018BAT 93\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019, \u2018DOR 364\u2019 \u00d7 \n\n\u2018G19833\u2019, and \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018AND277\u2019.  Seeds from \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 and \u2018AND277\u2019 were \n\nprovided by the P. vulgaris Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV \n\n(Vi\u00e7osa, MG, Brazil).  Seeds from the other common bean lines were provided \n\nby the Active Germplasm Bank of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, \n\nUSDA/ARS (Beltsville, MD, USA). \n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from bulked leaf tissue of five plants of \n\neach common bean line using the \u2018DNeasy Plant Mini\u2019 DNA extraction kit \n\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \n\n \n\n2.2.  Sources of PCR primers for STS amplification  \n\nSequences of the soybean PCR primers were obtained from the Beltsville \n\nAgricultural Research Center Soybean Map and SNP Database, at \n\nhttp://bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/soybean/ (Choi et al. 2007).  They were \n\nrandomly selected among STS primers designed to soybean shotgun and \n\nBAC-end sequences. \n\nCommon bean PCR primer sets designed to microsatellite flanking \n\nregions were obtained from published data available as of August 2008 on the \n\nBIC (Bean Improvement Cooperative) website \n\n(http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/Genetics.cfm).  Aiming to generate significant \n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\ninformation for mapping purpose, SSR primers were selected that have not \n\nbeen mapped on the common bean core mapping population (\u2018BAT 93\u2019 \u00d7 \n\n\u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019) as they did not show size polymorphisms between the parent \n\ncultivars. \n\nPCR primers were also designed to amplify common bean candidate \n\ngene sequences available at pertinent literature to represent a range of \n\nimportant agronomic functions.  Full-length gene sequences randomly selected \n\nfrom GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were also used as template to \n\ndesign STS primers.  Primers were designed using the software Primer3 \n\n(Whitehead Inst., Cambridge, MA, USA) and Array Designer 2 (Premier \n\nBiosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with predicted PCR products \n\nlength adjusted to 400 to 800 bp. \n\n \n\n2.3.  Preliminary test of PCR primers and DNA sequence analysis \n\nAll primers pairs designed were initially tested via PCR and agarose gel \n\nanalysis aiming to identify those producing single amplicons.  Amplification \n\nreactions were performed with 30 ng of genomic DNA from cultivar \u2018Jalo \n\nEEP558\u2019, 1.0 ?M of forward and reverse primers, 1.0 ?L of 2\u00d7 \u2018BioLine B\u2019 \n\nPCR buffer (BioLine USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2 U \n\nof homemade Taq DNA polymerase in a 10 ?L reaction volume.  DNA \n\namplification assays consisted of: one initial denaturation step at 94\u00baC for 5 \n\nmin; 30 cycles at 94\u00baC for 45 s, 58\u00baC (soybean primers) or 54\u00baC (common \n\nbean primers) for 1 min, and 72\u00baC for 1 min; and a final step at 72\u00baC for 7 \n\nmin.  The amplified products were visualized under UV light after \n\nelectrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 \n\n?g/mL), immersed in a 1\u00d7 sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium \n\nhydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).  Reactions with soybean \n\nprimers that gave no products were reamplified at annealing temperature of \n\n48\u00baC.  The primer sets that amplified a single discrete product were selected \n\nfor DNA sequence analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nThe single amplicons from selected PCR primer pairs were prepared for \n\nsequence analysis by treatment with 4 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) \n\nand 4 U of exonuclease I (ExoI) incubated at 37\u00baC for 1 h followed by 72\u00baC \n\nfor 15 min to inactivate the enzymes.  Labeling reactions were performed with \n\n1 ?L of PCR product, 1.0 ?L (4 U) of BigDye Terminator version 3.1 \n\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.5 ?M of one of the original \n\nPCR primers (forward and reverse primers in separate reactions), 0.8 ?L of \n\n10\u00d7 \u2018Promega\u2019 Taq DNA polymerase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), \n\nand 1.75 mM of MgCl2 in a 10 ?L reaction volume.  Labeling reactions \n\ncycling conditions were as follows: one initial denaturation step at 90\u00baC for 30 \n\ns; 40 cycles at 90\u00baC for 10 s, 50\u00baC for 5 s, and 60\u00baC for 1 min.  The PCR \n\nproducts were labeled from both ends and the resulting termination products \n\nwere sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer.  The two resulting sequence \n\ntraces derived from opposite ends of each amplicon were analyzed and aligned \n\nwith standard DNA analysis software Phred (Ewing and Green 1998) and \n\nPhrap (http://www.phrap.org/).  Resulting alignments and trace data were \n\nvisually inspected in the Consed viewer (Gordon et al. 1998) to distinguish \n\nthose amplicons that were locus specific and those that apparently resulted \n\nfrom amplification of two or more loci.  The primer pairs that produced single \n\namplicons with good quality sequence data were used for PCR amplification \n\nand sequencing of genomic DNA of the other five common bean genotypes: \n\n\u2018BAT 93\u2019, \u2018DOR 364\u2019, \u2018G19833\u2019, \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019, and \u2018AND277\u2019.  Resulting \n\namplicons were treated with SAP/ExoI, sequenced and analyzed as described \n\nfor \u2018Jalo EEP558\u2019.  Forward and reverse sequence traces from the six \n\ngenotypes were aligned. \n\n \n\n2.4.  STS verification and SNP discovery \n\nSNP discovery was carried out by sequence alignment using the SNP-PHAGE \n\nsoftware (Matukumalli et al. 2006).  Sequence traces for each putative SNP \n\nidentified were visually inspected to confirm the sequence polymorphisms.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\nSingle-DNA base changes and indels present in each alignment were recorded \n\nas described by Matukumalli et al.

Results \n\n \n\nA total of 1,499 soybean STS primer pairs were tested. Out of them, 513 \n\n(34.22%) amplified each a single PCR product in the common bean genome.  \n\nOut of those, 128 (8.54%) produced high quality sequence data. The total \n\nlength of aligned sequences was 66,085 bp and the mean length of each \n\namplicon was 516 bp.  Two hundred and seventy-seven SNPs were identified \n\nin 81 (5.40%) distinct DNA fragments. The frequency of SNPs was 4.19 \n\nSNPs/Kb and the nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka\u2019s theta was \n\n0.00184 (Table 1). \n\nOut of the 168 PCR primer pairs designed for common bean gene \n\nsequences, 109 (64.88%) amplified each a single discrete amplicon and 66 \n\n(39.29%) of them were selected after the DNA sequence analysis.  The total \n\nlength of aligned sequences was 38,167 bp and the mean length of STSs was \n\n578 bp. A total of 237 SNPs were identified in 48 (28.57%) distinct DNA \n\nfragments. The frequency of SNPs was 6.21 SNPs/Kb and the nucleotide \n\ndiversity was ? = 0.00272 (Table 2). \n\nSeven hundred and fifty-eight P. vulgaris SSR primer pairs were tested \n\nand 477 (62.93%) of them amplified a single DNA band. Because the DNA \n\nsequencing platform used (ABI 3730) was not efficient to sequence small \n\namplicons (&lt;200 bp), only bands > 200 bp (213) were selected for DNA \n\nsequence analysis. Out of them, 71 (33.33%) produced high quality \n\nsequencing data. The total length of aligned sequences was 26,868 bp and the \n\nmean length of single amplicons was 378 bp. One hundred and sixty-three \n\nSNPs were identified in 44 (20.66%) distinct fragments. The frequency of \n\n\n\n \n\n 9\n\nSNPs was 6.07 SNPs/Kb and the nucleotide diversity was ? = 0.00266 (Table \n\n3). \n\nThe results obtained using all 1880 distinct PCR primer pairs are \n\nsummarized in Table 4.  The aligned sequence of the 265 (14.10%) STSs \n\nresulted in the discovery of 677 SNPs in 173 (9.20%) distinct DNA fragments.  \n\nThe final length of aligned sequences was 131,120 bp and the mean length of \n\nthe single amplicons was 495 bp.  The final value of the frequency of SNPs \n\nwas 5.16 SNPs/Kb and the mean nucleotide diversity was ? = 0.00226. \n\nThe SNP classes are shown in Table 5.  Out of the 277 SNPs identified \n\nin DNA fragments generated with soybean STS primers, 123 (44.40%) are \n\ntransitions (A?G and C?T), 118 (42.60%) are transversions (A?C, A?T, \n\nC?G, and G?T), and 36 (13.00%) are indels.  Among the 237 SNPs found in \n\namplicons produced by primers designed to common bean genes, 109 \n\n(46.00%) transitions, 88 (37.13%) transversions, and 40 (16.87%) indels were \n\ndetected.  Of the 163 SNPs identified in PCR products generated by common \n\nbean SSR primers, 63 (38.65%) are transitions, 54 (33.13%) are transversions, \n\nand 46 (28.22%) are indels.  Of a total of 677 SNPs identified in this work, \n\n295 (43.57%) are transitions, 260 (38.41%) transversions, and 122 (18.02%) \n\nindels. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 10\n\nTable 1.

Discussion \n\n \n\nAs part of an international effort led by the Soybean Genomics and \n\nImprovement Laboratory (SGIL), USDA/ARS, aiming to develop SNP \n\nmarkers for P. vulgaris, primers designed to soybean shotgun and BAC-end \n\nsequences, to common bean genes and flanking SSR regions were examined \n\nfor locus-specific PCR amplification followed by resequencing of resulting \n\namplicons.  The use of available PCR primers (soybean STSs and common \n\nbean SSR primers) aimed to save time and money spent in the initial steps of \n\nprimer development.  However, considering the soybean-derived primers, only \n\n5.40% of them produced DNA fragments with at least one SNP (Table 1).  \n\nDespite the advantages mentioned above and the relatively close relationship \n\nof the soybean and common bean genomes (Zhu et al. 2005), the approach \n\nusing soybean-derived primers was not as productive as originally anticipated.  \n\nThe low rate of SNP discovery reported here was, mainly, the result of the \n\ninability to develop robust STSs using these primers (Table 1). \n\nThe recent development of a large number of common bean SSR \n\nmarkers provided a valuable resource of STSs for SNP discovery.  Out of the \n\nSSR primer sets available as of August 2008 and with sequences deposited in \n\nthe BIC website (http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/Genetics.cfm), we selected those \n\nthat had not been mapped in the bean core mapping population as they did not \n\nreveal size polymorphisms.  Our goal with this selection was to generate \n\ninformation useful to increase the saturation of P. vulgaris core genetic map.  \n\nOf a total of 785 SSR primer pairs tested in this work, 62.93% were \n\ndetermined to produce a single discrete PCR product.  This high percentage \n\nwas already expected since the primers had been previously identified and/or \n\nvalidated in common bean.  However, because the utilized DNA sequencing \n\nplatform (ABI 3730) was not efficient to sequence small amplicons, we were \n\nable to use only 28.10% (213) of the SSR primer sets (PCR products > 200 \n\nbp).  These 213 SSR primer pairs were used for sequence analysis of the six \n\ncontrasting P. vulgaris genotypes, and 20.66% produced single amplicons \n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\nwith good quality DNA sequence data and containing at least one SNP (Table \n\n3). \n\nOf a total of 168 primer sets designed to common bean gene sequences \n\nand examined for locus-specific PCR amplification followed by resequencing \n\nfor SNP discovery, 28.57% were determined to contain a sequence variant \n\n(Table 2).  The efficiency of the common bean-derived PCR primers in result \n\nan SNP-containing amplicon was higher than that observed in soybean \n\n(21.50%) using the same strategy (Choi et al. 2007).  The high level of \n\nduplication in the soybean genome complicates the development of robust \n\nSTSs and can be the main explanation for this discrepancy.   \n\nThe aligned sequence from all 265 STSs (131,120 bp) obtained from \n\nthe six common bean genotypes resulted in the discovery of 677 SNPs in 173 \n\nDNA fragments (Table 4).  Approximately 81.98% of the SNPs were single-\n\nbase changes of which 43.57% were transitions and 38.41% transversions.  \n\nThe remaining 18.02% SNPs were indels (Table 5).  The proportion of SNP \n\nclasses detected here is similar to that reported in soybean (47.28% transitions, \n\n37.61% transversions, and 15.11% indels) by Choi et al. (2007), but it differs \n\nsignificantly from that previously reported in common bean (31.45% \n\ntransitions, 35.75% transversions, and 32.80% indels) by Gait\u00e1n-Sol\u00eds et al. \n\n(2008).  \n\nThe nucleotide diversity verified in this work (? = 0.00226) in the \n\nanalyzed 131,160 bp of common bean DNA sequence is approximately twice \n\nas higher than that detected in soybean by Zhu et al. (2003) (? = 0.00086), \n\nHyten et al. (2006) (? = 0.00115), and Choi et al. (2007) (? = 0.00010).  \n\nHowever, a similar level of nucleotide diversity was verified in rice (? = \n\n0.00181) (Feltus et al. 2004), barley (? = 0.00250) (Kanazin et al. 2002), and \n\nsorghum (? = 0.00230) (Hamblin et al. 2004).  Higher nucleotide diversity \n\nlevels have also been reported in maize (? = 0.00627) (Wright et al. 2005) and \n\nsugarbeet (? = 0.00770) (Schneider et al. 2001).  A high nucleotide diversity \n\nvalue (? = 0.00627) was reported for common bean (Gait\u00e1n-Sol\u00eds et al. 2008), \n\nsimilar to that detected in maize.  This higher diversity level detected by these \n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\nauthors can be explained by the use of 10 highly diverse cultivated and wild \n\nbean genotypes from Mesoamerican and Andean origins. \n\nIt is important to highlight that the SNPs identified in the present work \n\nare not putative genome variations.  They are real DNA polymorphisms that \n\nwill be useful for genetic mapping, diversity analysis, and microsynteny \n\nstudies among legume species.  Additional information about these SNPs, i.e., \n\ntheir forward and reserve primers and respective SNP-containing amplicon \n\nsequences are available upon request.  Currently, SNP discovery approaches \n\nusing reduced representation libraries and high throughput sequence analysis \n\non the Illumina Genome Analyzer are being undertaken at SGIL.  In the near \n\nfuture analysis of the common bean SNPs developed in this work and others \n\nwill be tested in the common bean germplasm using the SNP GoldenGate \n\nassay on the Ilumina BeadStation.  In this assay it is possible to multiplex \n\nfrom 96 to 1,536 SNPs in a single reaction over a 3-day period (Fan et al. \n\n2003).  For this reason, it can be used for high throughput SNP genotyping.  \n\nThe Illumina GoldenGate assay has been demonstrated to function well with \n\nthe complex paleopolyploid genome of soybean (Hyten et al. 2008), thus it \n\nshould also work for a less complex genome as is the case of the common \n\nbean.  These data will certainly boost the common bean genetic mapping \n\nefforts aiming at QTL discovery and map-based cloning, as well as the use of \n\nmarker-assisted selection for cultivar development. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by grants from United States Department of \n\nAgriculture/Agriculture Research Service - USDA/ARS (American \n\nGovernment).

Although the SBR is currently not a serious problem to \n\nthe common bean crop, many bean breeders are concerned about this \n\npossibility because of the high severity and virulence diversity of P. \n\npachyrhizi, and its broad host range.  In this work a set of 44 P. vulgaris \n\ngenotypes were tested for resistance to P. pachyrhizi including resistance \n\nsources to several fungal common bean diseases, carioca-type, black-type and \n\nred-type Brazilian commercial cultivars, and advanced lines developed by the \n\nBIOAGRO/UFV breeding program.  Fourteen resistance sources to P. \n\npachyrhizi were identified.  \u2018PI 181996\u2019, \u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019, and \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019 \n\npresented the lowest mean scores of disease reaction.  \u2018PI181996\u2019 was crossed \n\nwith susceptible cultivars aiming to study the inheritance of resistance in this \n\ncommon bean accession.  The results support the hypothesis that resistance to \n\nP. pachyrhizi in \u2018PI181996\u2019 is monogenic and dominant. \n\n \n\nKey words:  Phakopsora pachyrhizi \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris \u2013 disease resistance \n\n\u2013 resistance source \u2013 inheritance study \u2013 prebreeding \n\n\n\n \n\n 21\n\n1.  Introduction \n\n \n\nSoybean rust (SBR), incited by the highly variable fungus Phakopsora \n\npachyrhizi H. Sydow &amp; P. Sydow, is reported as the major disease limiting \n\nsoybean (Glycine max L.) production in Asia (Hartman et al. 1992) and, most \n\nrecently, in the Americas.  Since the first detection of P. pachyrhizi incidence \n\nassociated with rust epidemics in the American continent, the pathogen has \n\nmoved swiftly from one country to the other.  SBR was first reported in \n\nParaguay and Brazil in 2001, after in the Argentina (2002), Bolivia (2003), \n\nUruguay and the US (2004), and in Mexico (2005) (Ivancovich 2005; Pivonia \n\nand Yang 2005; Schneider et al. 2005; Yorinori et al. 2005).  In Brazil, SBR \n\nwas first found and disseminated in the south-central areas.  In May 2001, it \n\nwas detected in the west region of the state of Paran\u00e1.  In the 2001/2002 crop \n\nseason, the disease was already found on all soybean fields of Paran\u00e1 and in \n\nsome areas of the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso, and Mato \n\nGrosso do Sul.  Yield losses due to soybean rust ranged from 30 to 75% \n\n(Yorinori et al. 2005).  Currently, SBR is endemic in almost all Brazilian \n\nsoybean growing areas and all soybean commercial cultivars are susceptible to \n\nP. pachyrhizi. \n\nControl measures for SBR include cultural practices (crop rotation, soil \n\nincorporation of soybean infected debris, planting within recommended dates, \n\netc.), growing tolerant cultivars, and timely spraying of fungicides (Hartman et \n\nal. 1992).  Compared to chemical control, the most utilized method to date, the \n\nuse of resistant cultivars not only is harmless to the environment but also an \n\neconomically sound strategy.  But the high severity and variability of the \n\npathogen prevent the efficient control of P. pachyrhizi by plant resistance and \n\nthe identification of effective-resistance sources in soybean. \n\nThe host range of P. pachyrhizi is broad, with over 90 species, \n\nincluding some economically important crops (Ono et al. 1992; Rytter et al. \n\n1984).  Among them is the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the food \n\nlegume most used for direct human consumption worldwide. The \n\n\n\n \n\n 22\n\npathogenicity of P. pachyrhizi has been reported on P. vulgaris cultivars gown \n\nunder field and controlled conditions, and tested by natural and artificial \n\ninoculations with the pathogen.  The first report on the virulence of P. \n\npachyrhizi on common bean lines inoculated under controlled conditions was \n\ndone by Stavely et al. (1985).  Most recently, SBR was reported on common \n\nbean accessions grown under natural-field conditions in South Africa, Brazil, \n\nand the USA (2005), and Argentina (2006) (DuPreez et al. 2005; Nunes Junior \n\net al. 2005; Lynch et al. 2006; Pastor-Corrales et al. 2006, 2007; Ivancovich et \n\nal. 2007). \n\nIn the research developed by Miles et al. (2007), common bean \n\ncultivars resistant to bean rust, incited by Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss \n\n(syn. U. phaseoli G. Winter), were tested against six isolates of P. pachyrhizi \n\nfrom Asia, Africa, and South America.  Resistance to all six isolates was \n\nidentified.  As previously reported by Stavely et al. (1985), when lesion sizes \n\nand spore production were compared between soybean and common bean \n\nsusceptible cultivars inoculated with virulent P. pachyrhizi isolates, the bean \n\ncultivars presented smaller lesions and less spores.  According to Stavely et al. \n\n(1985), when these same rust symptoms were compared on susceptible \n\ncommon bean cultivars inoculated with P. pachyrhizi and U. appendiculatus, \n\nthe SBR pathogen incited smaller lesions with less spore production than those \n\nincited by the bean rust pathogen.  It was concluded that P. pachyrhizi is not a \n\nthreat to common bean production unlike U. appendiculatus.  The smaller \n\nseverity of SBR on P. vulgaris compared to G. max accessions using natural \n\ninoculation assays under field conditions was also reported by DuPreez et al. \n\n(2005), Nunes Junior et al. (2005), Lynch et al. (2006), Pastor-Corrales et al. \n\n(2006, 2007), and Ivancovich et al. (2007).  Nevertheless, because the high \n\nvirulence diversity of P. pachyrhizi, in addition to its broad host range and \n\ngreat dispersal capacity, many bean breeders are concerned about the \n\npossibility that SBR also becomes a serious problem to the common bean crop \n\nin endemic areas. \n\n\n\n \n\n 23\n\nA similar phenomenon was already reported in the common bean \n\ngrowing system.  The angular leaf spot, incited by the fungus \n\nPseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous &amp; U. Braun, was already considered \n\nas one of the least important diseases for the bean crop until approximately 20 \n\nyears ago.  However, to date angular leaf spot is one of the most destructive \n\nfungal diseases affecting the common bean production in Brazil and other \n\ntropical and sub-tropical growing areas of the world (Sartorato 2002).  In \n\nBrazil, yield losses caused by P. griseola may reach between 70% and 100% \n\n(Jesus Junior et al. 2001). \n\nBased on the reported information, the identification and use of SBR \n\nresistance sources in P. vulgaris is being considered as strategic for the \n\ncommon bean breeding programs focused on disease resistance.  In addition, \n\nconsidering the current possibilities presented by the modern biotechnology \n\ntools, this effort may also lead to the development of transgenic soybean \n\ncultivars with effective resistance to P. pachyrhizi. \n\nThe main goal of the present work was to identify SBR resistance \n\nsources among common bean accessions maintained in the P. vulgaris Active \n\nGermplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV (Instituto de Biotecnologia Aplicada \n\n\u00e0 Agropecu\u00e1ria of the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa).  To better understand \n\nthe genetic control of plant resistance in the pathosystem P. pachyrhizi\u2013P. \n\nvulgaris, we also determined the inheritance mode of SBR resistance in the \n\ncommon bean accession \u2018PI181996\u2019, one of the resistant sources identified in \n\nthis work. \n\n\n\n \n\n 24\n\n2.  Material and Methods \n\n \n\n2.1.  Plant genetic material \n\nCharacteristics of the common bean accessions screened for SBR resistance in \n\nthe present work are summarized in Table 1.  Among the accessions there are: \n\nresistance sources to common bean diseases, such as rust, anthracnose, and \n\nangular leaf spot; Brazilian commercial cultivars with carioca-type, black-\n\ntype, and red-type genetic backgrounds; and advanced lines developed by the \n\nBIOAGRO/UFV breeding program. \n\nSeeds from the differential cultivars for bean rust (Table 1) were \n\nprovided by the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical - CIAT (Cali, \n\nColombia).  Seeds from cultivars \u2018IAPAR 14\u2019, \u2018IAPAR 16\u2019, and \u2018IAPAR 57\u2019 \n\nwere provided by Dr. Vania Moda-Cirino of the Instituto Agron\u00f4mico do \n\nParan\u00e1 - IAPAR (Londrina, Paran\u00e1, Brazil).  Seeds from the other common \n\nbean lines were supplied by BIOAGRO/UFV (Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil).   \n\nSoybean cultivars \u2018CAC-1\u2019 and \u2018Cristalina\u2019 were used as susceptible \n\ncontrol in the SBR resistance screening as they are highly susceptible to P. \n\npachyrhizi under field condition in Brazil.  Soybean lines harboring the four \n\nidentified single resistance genes to the pathogen were also included in the \n\ninoculation assays: \u2018PI200492\u2019 (gene Rpp1); \u2018PI547878\u2019 (gene Rpp2), line \n\nderived from \u2018Willians\u2019 (susceptible) and \u2018PI230970\u2019 (gene Rpp2); \u2018PI462312\u2019 \n\n(gene Rpp3); and \u2018PI459025\u2019 (gene Rpp4).  Seeds from all soybean accessions \n\nwere also provided by BIOAGRO/UFV. \n\nIn order to standardize their vigor and germination power, seeds from \n\nall common bean and soybean accessions were multiplied under greenhouse \n\nconditions before the disease screening tests.  Ten plants from each accession \n\nwere inoculated with the pathogen. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 25\n\nTable 1.

P. pachyrhizi inoculum \n\nThe initial inoculum of P. pachyrhizi was obtained from soybean cultivar \n\n\u2018CAC-1\u2019 plants infected under field conditions in UFV experimental stations \n\nlocated in Vi\u00e7osa, Coimbra and Tocantins, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.  The \n\nspores were periodically multiplied on cultivar \u2018CAC-1\u2019 in order to increase \n\nthe inoculum and maintain its virulence.  Since the inoculum is not a single-\n\npustule isolate, i.e., it did not originate from a single lesion, it is possible that it \n\nrepresents a mixture of more than one pathotype.  Therefore, all \n\nmultiplications of the inoculum as well as disease screening tests were \n\nmonitored for the appearance of mixed lesions or highly contrasting reaction \n\ndegrees on a same soybean or common bean genotype. \n\nAlthough P. pachyrhizi does not grow in artificial culture as it is an \n\nobligate parasite, viable spores can be preserved under artificial conditions.  In \n\nthe BIOAGRO/UFV, dry spores in plastic or glass tubes are being successfully \n\nmaintained under dark conditions at -80\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen. \n\nGenomic DNA of spores obtained from the inoculum used in this work \n\nwas utilized for PCR analysis with specific primers designed to amplify ITS \n\n(Internal Transcribed Spacer) regions of P. pachyrhizi (Asian SBR) and P. \n\nmeibomiae (Arthur) Arthur (American SBR) (Frederick et al. 2002).  \n\nDifferentiation between Asian SBR and American SBR symptoms by visual \n\nevaluation only is not efficient (Ono et al. 1992).  Fungal DNA extraction and \n\nPCR conditions were as described by Frederick et al. (2002).  The primers \n\nused in the test were: Ppm1 (5\u2019-GCAGAATTCAGTGAATCATCAAG-3\u2019) \n\nand Ppa2 (5\u2019-GCAACACTCAAAATCCAACAAT-3\u2019), for the P. pachyrhizi-\n\nspecific assay, and Ppm1 and Pme2 (5\u2019-CTCAAACAGGTGTACCTTTTGG-\n\n3\u2019), for the P. meibomiae-specific assay.  Each DNA amplification assay \n\nconsisted of: one initial denaturation step at 94\u00baC for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94\u00baC \n\nfor 1 min, 57\u00baC for 1 min, 72\u00baC for 1 min and 30 s; and a final step at 72\u00baC for \n\n7 min.  The electrophoresis analyses were performed in 3.0% agarose gel \n\ncontaining ethidium bromide (0.2 ?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric \n\nacid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium hydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric \n\n\n\n \n\n 29\n\nacid).  DNA template control of P. pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae were \n\nprovided by Dr. Ricardo Abdelnoor of the Embrapa Soja (Londrina, Paran\u00e1, \n\nBrazil).   \n\n \n\n2.3.  Inoculation and disease screening \n\nThe primary leaves and the first trifolium of all plants were inoculated about \n\n15 days after sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C).  Prior to \n\ninoculation, spores were removed from storage conditions (-80\u00b0C), heat \n\nshocked at 40\u00baC for 10 min, and hydrated by incubating in a small plastic \n\nweigh boat over water for 24 h.  The inoculum concentration was 3.0 \u00d7 105 P. \n\npachyrhizi spores/mL distilled water containing Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The \n\ninoculum was sprayed on both leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De \n\nVilbiss no 15) powered by an electric compressor.  After inoculation the plants \n\nwere transferred to a mist chamber (20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and relative humidity > 95%) \n\nwhere they were kept for 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  After this period \n\nthe plants were transferred to a greenhouse (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C), where they were kept \n\nuntil symptom evaluation. \n\nDisease symptoms were evaluated at 15, 20 and 25 days after the \n\ninoculations based on a 1-to-5 scale modified from Stavely (1985).  In this \n\nscale, 1 = no sporulation, 2 = sporulation present but less than 10% of fully \n\nsporulating lesions, 3 = sporulation present and 11 to 25% of fully sporulating \n\nlesions, 4 = sporulation present and 26 to 40% of fully sporulating lesions, and \n\n5 = sporulation present and 65 to 100% of fully sporulating lesions. \n\nRust lesions in both surfaces of the inoculated leaves were determined \n\nvisually by at least two independent evaluators.  Individual plants with degrees \n\n1-to-3 were considered resistance, whereas those with degrees 4 or 5 were \n\nconsidered susceptible.  When different plants of the same accession were \n\nevaluated, accessions presenting mean scores of disease reaction ? 3.00 were \n\nconsidered resistance and those with mean scores > 3.00, susceptible. \n\n\n\n \n\n 30\n\n2.4.  Crosses and genetic analysis of F1, F2 and F3 generations \n\nInheritance of SBR resistance in the common bean accession \u2018PI181996\u2019 was \n\nstudied by crossing this resistance source with the susceptible cultivars \u2018US \n\nPinto 111\u2019 and \u2018Mexico 309\u2019.  The plants were grown and artificially crossed \n\nunder greenhouse condition. \n\nAll F1 plants from the cross \u2018PI181996\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018US Pinto 111\u2019 were \n\nanalyzed morphologically (flower color).  Because \u2018PI181996\u2019 and \u2018Mexico \n\n309\u2019 are black seeded beans with similar flower color and other morphological \n\ntraits, the F1 plants derived from the crosses between them were analyzed with \n\nRAPD markers as proposed by Alzate-Marin et al. (1996).  As \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 \n\nwas used as female parent, the presence in the F1 plant of a PCR product \n\nwhich was present only in \u2018PI181996\u2019 confirmed that the plant was indeed a \n\nhybrid.  Plant DNA samples were extracted according to Doyle and Doyle \n\n(1990).  DNA amplification by the RAPD technique was accomplished \n\naccording to Alzate-Marin et al. (1996) and the electrophoresis analyses were \n\ndone on 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.2 ?g/mL), \n\nimmersed in a 1X SB buffer.  All selected F1 plants were used to obtain the F2 \n\nand then the F3 populations. \n\nPlants from F2 and F3 populations, soybean control cultivars \u2018CAC-1\u2019 \n\nand \u2018Cristalina\u2019, and the parental common bean lines were inoculated with P. \n\npachyrhizi and screened for SBR reaction.  The ratio of resistant and \n\nsusceptible reactions observed in the segregating population was tested for \n\ngoodness-of-fit to theoretical ratios with Chi-square (?2) test. \n\n\n\n \n\n 31\n\n3.  Results \n\n \n\n3.1.  Phakopsora spp. molecular detection test \n\nPCR analysis using genomic DNA of spores from the inoculum used in this \n\nwork and ITS region-specific primers for P. pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae \n\ndetection, previously reported by Frederick et al. (2002), was efficiently \n\naccomplished.  The results are shown in Figure 1.  The amplification of PCR \n\nproducts only with P. pachyrhizi-specific primers confirmed that the inoculum \n\nused for SBR resistance screening is indeed from P. pachyrhizi.  \n\n  \n\n3.2.  Reaction of common bean accessions to P. pachyrhizi \n\nOut of the 44 common bean accessions tested against the SBR pathogen, 14 \n\nwere considered resistant (mean scores of disease reaction ? 3.00) and the \n\nother 30 accessions were considered to be susceptible (mean scores of disease \n\nreaction > 3.00) (Table 2). \n\nNone of the common bean accessions presented immune reaction to P. \n\npachyrhizi (Table 2).  However, three resistant lines, \u2018PI181996\u2019, \u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019 and \n\n\u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019, were considered to be promising sources for resistance to \n\nSBR.  They presented mean scores of disease reaction of 2.25 \u00b1 0.26, 2.20 \u00b1 \n\n0.41, and 2.20 \u00b1 0.35, respectively (Table 2).  On the other hand, 15 P. \n\nvulgaris susceptible accessions were identified: \u2018AND 277\u2019, \u2018Cornell 49-242\u2019, \n\n\u2018California Small White 643\u2019, \u2018Diamante Negro\u2019, \u2018Dorado\u2019, \u2018Mexico 309\u2019, \n\n\u2018Mexico 54\u2019, \u2018Ouro Vermelho\u2019, \u2018PI260418\u2019, \u2018Pinto Olathe\u2019, \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019, \u2018SEL \n\n1308\u2019, \u2018TU\u2019, \u2018US Pinto 111\u2019, and \u2018Vermelhinho\u2019.  They presented mean scores \n\nof disease reaction equal or greater than 4.50 (Table 2). \n\n\n\n \n\n 32\n\n \nFigure 1.  Phakopsora spp. molecular detection test.  Electrophoretic analysis \non 3.0 % agarose gel of amplification products obtained with P. pachyrhizi-\nspecific (A) and P. meibomiae-specific (B) primers (Frederick et al. 2002).  \nLanes are as follows: L, size marker (100-bp DNA ladder); 1, no DNA \ntemplate control; 2, P. pachyrhizi DNA control; 3, P. meibomiae DNA \ncontrol; and 4, genomic DNA of spores obtained from the P. pachyrhizi \ninoculum used in this work.  PCR products between 100 and 200-bp are \npresent in lanes 2A and 4A, and 3B. \n \n\n \n\nAll soybean cultivars presented susceptible reaction to the SBR \n\npathogen, showing high mean scores of disease reaction, including the lines \n\nharboring the resistance genes Rpp1, Rpp2, Rpp3, and Rpp4 (Table 2).  As \n\npreviously reported by Stavely et al. (1985) and Miles et al. (2007), the \n\nsoybean cultivars presented lesion sizes and spore production greater than \n\nthose presented by the common bean susceptible accessions (data not shown). \n\n Although the inoculum used for disease screening tests did not originate \n\nfrom a single pustule, no mixed lesion types or highly contrasting reaction \n\ndegrees were observed on plants from a same soybean or common bean \n\naccession.  This could be verified by analyzing the standard error values \n\nassociated to the mean scores of disease reaction (Table 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\nTable 2.

The segregation for P. pachyrhizi resistance \n\non both F2 populations fit a 3 resistant: 1 susceptible ratio (3R_:1rr) with ?\n2 \n\nvalues of 0.0487 and 0.0289, and probability (P) values of 82.52% and \n\n86.48%, respectively (Table 3). \n\nOne hundred and seven F3 plants from the crosses between \u2018US Pinto \n\n111\u2019 and \u2018PI181996\u2019 and 162 F3 plants resulting from the cross \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 \n\n\u00d7 \u2018PI181996\u2019 were also inoculated.

Discussion \n\n \n\nIn a pilot experiment aiming to identify SBR resistance sources in P. vulgaris \n\nto be better characterized and potentially explored by common bean and \n\nsoybean breeding programs, here we screened 44 accessions from the P. \n\nvulgaris Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV with P. pachyrhizi.  \n\nThree accessions were selected as promising resistance sources because their \n\nlow disease reactions expressed in mean scores of infection degree (1-to-5 \n\ndegrees) and their respective standard error values: \u2018PI181996\u2019 (2.25 \u00b1 0.26), \n\n\u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019 (2.20 \u00b1 0.41), and \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019 (2.20 \u00b1 0.35) (Table 2).  \n\n\u2018PI181996\u2019 has already been reported as resistance to six isolates of P. \n\npachyrhizi from Taiwan, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Paraguay, and Brazil when \n\ninoculated under controlled conditions in the USA (Miles et al. 2007).  This \n\nresistance source also presented no visible SBR symptoms in experiments \n\nusing natural-field inoculation carried out in Brazil and South Africa (Nunes \n\nJunior et al. 2005; Pastor-Corrales et al. 2006, 2007). \n\nBecause the lowest mean score of disease reaction of \u2018PI181996\u2019 \n\nobserved in this work, considering its associated standard error value, it was \n\nused in inheritance studies to elucidate the genetic control of its resistance to \n\nP. pachyrhizi.  Crosses between \u2018PI181996\u2019 and the susceptible cultivars \u2018US \n\nPinto 111\u2019 (4.75 \u00b1 0.26) and \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 (4.55 \u00b1 0.16) (Table 2) were done.  \n\nThe segregating populations F2 and F3 were obtained from these two crosses \n\nand screened with the pathogen.  The results showed that SBR resistance in \n\n\u2018PI181996\u2019 is monogenic and dominant. \n\nIt was also verified in this work that, in general, resistance to P. \n\npachyrhizi is not correlated to resistance to other fungal common bean \n\ndiseases, such as rust, anthracnose and angular leaf spot (Tables 1 and 2).  \n\nAlthough some carioca-type advanced lines developed by BIOAGRO/UFV \n\npresented resistance, it is possible that most bean lines now being developed in \n\nBrazil will be susceptible to the pathogen, as the carioca-type, black-type and \n\n\n\n \n\n 36\n\nred-type cultivars (parental lines) currently grown in the country were \n\nsusceptible to P. pachyrhizi (Tables 1 and 2). \n\nSBR is not a serious problem to bean crop to date, but the results \n\nreported here indicate that works aiming to identify and explore resistance \n\nsources in P. vulgaris may be considered as strategic for the common bean \n\nbreeding programs.  Additionally, this effort may also help the development of \n\ntransgenic soybean cultivars with effective resistance to P. pachyrhizi since \n\nthe single dominant resistance genes identified in soybean (Rpp1, Rpp2, Rpp3, \n\nand Rpp4) condition resistance to a limited set of rust pathotypes and the \n\nresistance has not shown to be durable (Hartman et al. 2005). This would \n\nobviously demand the cloning of the gene(s) conferring resistance to SBR in \n\nthe common bean and its (their) transfer to the soybean genome. The \n\ndifferential response to P. pachyrhizi presented by the P. vulgaris accessions \n\nalso suggests that some of them could be used as differentials cultivars for \n\nclassification of the fungus physiological races. \n\nThe Phakopsora spp. molecular detection test confirms that the spores \n\nused in our inoculation assays are indeed from P. pachyrhizi (Figure 1).  Since \n\nwe did not use a single-pustule isolate for the SBR resistance screening, it was \n\npossible that the inoculum represented a mixture of many pathotypes \n\ndifficulting the disease evaluating process.  But no mixed lesions or highly \n\ncontrasting reaction degrees on a same soybean or common bean genotype \n\nwere observed in the greenhouse inoculations, as shown by the standard error \n\nvalues associated to the mean scores of disease reaction presented in Table 2.  \n\nThe results from our inheritance studies also showed that the inoculum was \n\nefficient to detect the monogenic dominant nature of the resistance to P. \n\npachyrhizi in \u2018PI181996\u2019 (Table 3).  However, we cannot discard that a gene \n\ncluster or complex loci (closely linked genes) governs SBR resistance in this \n\ncommon bean line. \n\nBased on the results obtained from Stavely et al. (1985), Miles et al. \n\n(2007), and Pastor-Corrales et al. (2007) that indicated the common bean line \n\n\u2018CNC\u2019 as a promising resistance source to P. pachyrhizi, Pastor-Corrales and \n\n\n\n \n\n 37\n\nFrederick (2008) analyzed the segregating resistance pattern to P. pachyrhizi \n\namong 241 F2 plants derived from crosses between susceptible cultivar \n\n\u2018Mexico 309\u2019 and \u2018CNC\u2019.  The results showed that the SBR resistance in \n\n\u2018CNC\u2019 is controlled by the interaction of two genes with complete dominance \n\nat both gene pairs: one dominant allele of each two genes is necessary to \n\nproduce the resistant phenotype but either recessive homozygote is epistatic to \n\nthe other gene.  Additional assays analyzing other segregating generation are \n\nbeing carried out to confirm these results (Dr. Marcial A. Pastor-Corrales, \n\npersonal communication). \n\nCurrently, fungicide spraying is the only effective method to control \n\nSBR worldwide.  This strategy increases production costs and exposes the \n\nenvironment to high levels of chemicals.  As a first step towards the \n\ndevelopment of common bean cultivars resistant to SBR, we identified \n\nresistance sources and studied the genetic basis of this resistance in P. \n\nvulgaris.  To date we are working on the identification of molecular markers \n\nlinked to the resistance gene present in \u2018PI181996\u2019 aiming their utilization for \n\nmarker-assisted selection.  We are also conducing additional inheritance \n\nstudies using a P. pachyrhizi single-pustule isolate recently obtained by our \n\ngroup.  Additionally, other P. vulgaris accessions are being screened aiming at \n\nthe identification of effective resistance to the disease. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by grants from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de \n\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico) and FAPEMIG (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nAmparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais); Brazilian Government.  \n\nCNPq provided a PhD fellowship to the first author.

It is grown in distinct regions and \n\ndifferent seasons around the world by subsistence level farmers with low-\n\ntechnology input as well as by farmers that use high input technologies. \n\nUnfortunately, compared to other important grain legumes common bean \n\nyields are quite low. One of the several factors contributing to this situation is \n\nthe high number of destructive diseases that attack P. vulgaris and cause \n\nserious damage to the crop. Among them is bean rust, incited by the highly \n\nvariable fungus Uromyces appendiculatus. This disease is distributed \n\nthroughout the world, but it effectively causes major production problems in \n\nhumid tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, rust causes major losses in \n\nsouth, southeast, and central regions of the country. Bean rust control by plant \n\nresistance is an easy and economical strategy to be used in association to other \n\nrust management practices. The pyramiding of different race-specific \n\nresistance genes in association with other genes conferring adult plant \n\nresistance, slow rusting, and reduced pustule size can prolong the lifespan of a \n\ncommon bean cultivar by creating a more durable resistance complex against \n\nthe rust pathogen. This review presents an overview about the bean rust and \n\nreports some breeding initiatives aiming at the development of rust resistant \n\ncultivars in the BIOAGRO/UFV, Minas Gerais, Brazil. \n\n \n\nKeywords:  gene pyramiding \u2013 host-pathogen interaction \u2013 marker-assisted \n\nselection \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris \u2013 plant resistance \u2013 Uromyces appendiculatus \n\n\n\n \n\n 42\n\n1.  Introduction \n\n \n\nThe common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important legume \n\ndirectly used for human consumption worldwide. Among the five \n\ndomesticated and grown species of the genus Phaseolus, a genus comprised of \n\nsome 70 species (Freytag and Debouck 2002), P. vulgaris accounts for more \n\nthan 90% of the cultivated crop in the world (Singh et al. 1991a, 2001). Dry \n\nbean cultivars of the species P. vulgaris were grown and consumed on \n\napproximately 27 million hectares in more than 120 countries in 2007 \n\n(http://faostat.fao.org). The social value of the common bean is extremely high \n\nto millions of people in many countries and most especially in developing \n\ncountries of Latin America, and Eastern and Southern Africa (Pachico 1989; \n\nWortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). In Brazil, the main producer \n\nand consumer country (http://www.fao.org), dry beans are the main source of \n\nvegetable protein, minerals, and vitamins for a major proportion of the \n\npopulation. The set of essential amino acids present in dry bean seeds is \n\ncomplementary to that in grains of cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa L.). \n\n Some bean seed properties have been shown to contribute positively to \n\nmajor health issues, such as the control of type II diabetes. Regular bean \n\nconsumption also lowers glycemic and cholesterolemic indices and decreases \n\nthe incidence of certain types of cancer (Andersen et al. 1984; Hangen and \n\nBennink 2003). \n\n The attack of pests and pathogens is one of the main causes of yield and \n\nquality losses in the common bean crop worldwide (Stavely and Pastor-\n\nCorrales 1989). This is especially true for small farmers with low-technology \n\ninputs, which play an important role, as they account for the greatest fraction \n\nof the product for the world market supply (http://faostat.fao.org). Among the \n\nmost serious diseases that attack common bean we find bean rust, incited by \n\nthe highly variable fungus Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss (syn. U. \n\nphaseoli G. Winter). This disease is distributed throughout the world, but it \n\neffectively causes major production problems in humid tropical and \n\n\n\n \n\n 43\n\nsubtropical areas and periodic severe epidemics in humid temperate regions \n\n(Souza et al. 2008). Severe bean rust epidemics have been reported in Brazil \n\nand other Latin American countries as well as in Australia, China, the United \n\nStates, and some areas of Europe (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989). \n\n According to Lindgren et al. (1995) a 1% increase in bean rust severity \n\nleads to a yield loss of approximately 19 kg/ha. The major losses in Brazil \n\noccur in south, southeast and central areas, including the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio \n\nGrande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Goi\u00e1s (Souza et \n\nal. 2005a). Yield losses higher than 68% have been detected in the state of \n\nMinas Gerais located in the southeast region of the country (Vieira et al. \n\n2005). \n\nNo single cost-effective or efficient control measure can be \n\nrecommended to prevent rust infection in all cases or different regions. \n\nDisease management practices for bean rust control include crop rotation, soil \n\nincorporation of bean debris, planting within recommended dates, growing \n\nresistant cultivars, and timely spraying of fungicides (Mmbaga et al. 1996). \n\nCompared to chemical control the use of plant resistance not only is \n\nharmless to the environment but also an economically sound strategy. \n\nHowever, the wide variability of U. appendiculatus represents an obstacle to \n\nbreeders aiming at the development of common bean cultivars with durable \n\nresistance to rust. The combination of different rust resistance (RR) genes in \n\nthe same cultivar has been proposed as an important strategy for obtaining \n\neffective and durable genetic resistance to rust (Johnson 1984; Stavely and \n\nPastor-Corrales 1989; Kelly et al. 1995; Souza et al. 2005b, 2007a). This can \n\nbe accomplished by gene pyramiding, when distinct genes are combined in the \n\nsame cultivar, or by using multilines, when different genes are transferred to \n\ndifferent lines of the same cultivar. For gene pyramiding, knowledge about the \n\ninheritance and organization of the genes and also the use of proper selection \n\ntools are of paramount importance (Souza et al. 2008). \n\nMolecular markers have been used to assist different steps of common \n\nbean breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars resistant to rust. \n\n\n\n \n\n 44\n\nIsozymes and DNA-based markers have been used to study the genetic \n\ndiversity of the rust fungus (Lu and Groth 1988; Linde et al. 1990a, 1990b; \n\nMcCain et al. 1992; Groth et al. 1995; Maclean et al. 1995; Faleiro et al. \n\n1998) and also for mapping and characterizing resistance genes to U. \n\nappendiculatus and to other important bean pathogens (Freyre et al. 1998; \n\nMiklas et al. 2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2008). \n\nIn this review we describe and discuss important aspects about the bean \n\nrust. In addition, we present common bean breeding initiatives aiming at the \n\ndevelopment of rust resistant cultivars in Brazil. We have focused mainly the \n\nroutine of the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding Program, which is \n\nassisted by molecular marker. This program is the main bean breeding \n\nprogram aiming rust resistance conducted in Brazil. Its objectives include the \n\ngenetic study of host-pathogen interaction, identification and validation of \n\nmolecular markers linked to RR genes, and the effective use of these markers \n\nfor the development of cultivars with durable resistance to rust. \n\n \n\n2.  Characterization and Maintenance of the Pathogen \n\n \n\n2.1.  Differential cultivars for U. appendiculatus \n\nDuring the \u201cBean Rust Workshop\u201d (BRW), held in 1983, 35 researchers from \n\ndifferent countries proposed a series of 20 cultivars as the international \n\ndifferential standard for U. appendiculatus (Stavely et al. 1983) (Table 1). In \n\n1984, cv. \u2018Mountainer White Half Runner\u2019 was eliminated from this series due \n\nto its similarity with \u2018Kentucky Wonder 780\u2019 (Stavely 1984a). \n\nCharacterization of Brazilian isolates based on those 19 differential cultivars \n\nwas accomplished by Mora-Nu\u00f1es et al. (1992), Santos and Rios (2000) and \n\nSouza et al. (2005a). In their work, Mora-Nu\u00f1es et al. (1992) concluded that \n\neight out of the 19 cultivars \u2013 \u2018Kentucky  Wonder 814\u2019, \u2018Early Gallatin\u2019, \n\n\u201851051\u2019, \u2018NEP 2\u2019, \u2018Ecuador 299\u2019, \u2018Olathe\u2019, \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 and \u2018Redlands \n\nPioneer\u2019 \u2013 were sufficient to discriminate and classify isolates collected in \n\n\n\n \n\n 45\n\nBrazil. Using these eight cultivars, Faleiro et al. (1999a) characterized 13 \n\nraces of this fungus in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

CNC \naDeleted of the list because of its similarity to \u2018Kentucky Wonder 780\u2019 (Stavely 1984a). \n \n\n \n\n In the 3rd BRW held in 2002, a new differential series was proposed for \n\ncharacterization of U. appendiculatus isolates (Steadman et al. 2002). This \n\nseries contains six Andean and six Mesoamerican bean cultivars (Table 2). \n\nCultivars \u2018Early Gallatin\u2019, \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019, \u2018Golden Gate Wax\u2019, \u2018Aurora\u2019, \n\n\u2018Mexico 309\u2019, \u2018Mexico 235\u2019 and \u2018CNC\u2019, which were proposed in the 1983 \n\nBRW, were maintained in the present differential series. Cultivars \n\n\u2018Montcalm\u2019, \u2018PC-50\u2019, \u2018PI 260418\u2019, \u2018Great Northern 1140\u2019 and \u2018PI 181996\u2019 \n\nwere added to the series. The wide adoption of this system can contribute to \n\nthe elaboration of an internationally standardized classification methodology, \n\nand facilitate the exchange of information, and the cooperative use of the \n\nresults obtained by different research groups throughout the world. \n\n \n\n2.2.  Obtaining of single-pustule isolates  \n\nObtaining single-pustule isolates from U. appendiculatus primary inoculum is \n\nan important initial step before the characterization and use of the pathogen in \n\nrust resistance tests. Single-pustule isolates are pure lines of the pathogen; \n\n\n\n \n\n 46\n\nspecific genotypes of the fungus. They are essential in the study of host-\n\npathogen interaction, host resistance and pathogen specialization. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

But most \n\noften they are isolated from fungal spores collected from plant tissues infected \n\nunder natural conditions in bean growing areas or experimental stations. For \n\nsingle-pustule isolation, a lower than usual inoculum concentration is used for \n\ninoculation in order to increase the chance of getting individual pustules. The \n\nspores collected in these single-pustules are multiplied in susceptible varieties \n\nfor three or more consecutive cycles, using the regular inoculum \n\nconcentration. After this procedure, the uredospores are collected and stored \n\nunder controlled conditions (Souza et al. 2007a). \n\n \n\n2.3.  Physiological races \n\nClassification of U. appendiculatus into physiological races and the \n\nconsequent knowledge of its virulence diversity is a basic step towards \n\n\n\n \n\n 47\n\nunderstanding the dynamics of the pathogen distribution and the development \n\nof resistant cultivars. In this step it is also possible to identify which pathogen \n\nisolates can be used to monitor the introgression of resistance genes in \n\nbreeding programs (Pastor-Corrales 2001; Pastor-Corrales and Stavely 2002; \n\nSouza et al. 2007a). \n\n Steadman et al. (2002) proposed a binary nomenclature system for \n\ndesignation of the races in which the evaluation scale was divided in only two \n\nreaction degrees: resistant and susceptible. Each race is designated by two \n\nnumbers separated by a hyphen. The first number is obtained by the sum of \n\nthe binary values attributed to the susceptible Andean cultivars of the \n\ndifferential series. The second number is obtained by the sum of the binary \n\nvalues of the susceptible Mesoamerican cultivars (see Table 2). \n\n Characterization of U. appendiculatus isolates collected in the USA, \n\nSouth Africa, Honduras, Argentina and Mozambique has been accomplished \n\nbased on the procedure proposed in the 3rd BRW (Steadman et al. 2002; \n\nAcevedo et al. 2004; Jochua et al. 2004). Souza et al. (2007a) reported the \n\nfirst work using the standard system for classification of U. appendiculatus \n\nphysiological races in Brazil using U. appendiculatus single-pustule isolates \n\nobtained from the fungal collection of BIOAGRO/UFV. \n\n \n\n2.4.  Fungal collection \n\nAlthough U. appendiculatus does not grow in artificial culture as it is an \n\nobligate parasite, viable spores can be preserved under laboratory conditions. \n\nDry uredospores in plastic or glass tubes have been successfully maintained \n\nunder dark conditions at 5 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and relative humidity &lt;50% for about one \n\nyear at BIOAGRO/UFV. Alternatively, uredospores of the fungus frozen at -\n\n80\u00b0C or submersed in liquid nitrogen can be stored for a longer period of time \n\n(Souza et al. 2008). Periodical inoculation of the preserved spores on \n\nsusceptible common bean varieties is highly recommended, in order to \n\nincrease the inoculum virulence. \n\n\n\n \n\n 48\n\n3.  Disease Screening \n\n \n\n3.1.  U. appendiculatus inoculation \n\nU. appendiculatus inoculation is often done when the primary leaves of the \n\nbean plants reach approximately 2/3 of their full development, about 10 days \n\nafter sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C). The standard \n\nconcentration of inoculum is 2.0 \u00d7 104 uredospores/mL of distilled water \n\ncontaining 0.05% Tween-20. The inoculum solution can be applied on both \n\nleaf surfaces with a brush or sprayed using a manual atomizer (e.g., atomizer \n\nDe Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an electric compressor. After inoculation the \n\nplants are transferred to a mist chamber (20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and relative humidity > \n\n95%) where they are kept for approximately 48 h under a 12-hour light \n\nregime. In order to avoid contamination, plants inoculated with different \n\nisolates are kept in separate compartments of the chamber. After this period \n\nthe plants are transferred to a greenhouse (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C), where they are kept until \n\nsymptom evaluation, about 14 days after inoculation (Carrijo et al. 1980; \n\nSouza et al. 2005a, 2007a). \n\n The inoculation can also be conduced using common bean excised \n\nleaves, as reported by Souza et al. (2005c). In this alternative method, after \n\ninoculation, each leaf is placed in a Petri dish (90 \u00d7 15 mm) on a sterile filter \n\npaper previously moistened with 3.0 mL distilled water. The dishes are \n\nincubated in a BOD at 20\u00b0C, under a 12-hour light regime. Each filter paper is \n\nmoistened again with 1.5 mL distilled water every three-days until disease \n\nsymptom evaluation, about 10 days after inoculation. \n\n Both inoculation methods are efficient for evaluating the reaction of the \n\ncommon bean to U. appendiculatus. The only differences observed on the \n\nresults by the two methods is that the number of pustules is higher in the \n\nconventional method and disease symptoms appear earlier in the alternative \n\nmethod (Souza et al. 2005c). It is suggested that the conventional inoculation \n\nmethod is more appropriate for spore multiplication and the excised leaf \n\nmethod can be used in the cases where the same plant needs to be assayed \n\n\n\n \n\n 49\n\nseveral times. Another advantage of the alternative procedure refers to costs \n\nand safety; the whole method can be conducted in the laboratory without the \n\nneed of exposing other plants to the pathogen. In addition, the tested plants are \n\nstill able to grow and produce seeds. \n\n \n\n3.2.  Evaluation of rust symptoms \n\nThe fungus U. appendiculatus may infect leaves, pods, and, rarely, stems and \n\nbranches.  Symptoms usually appear first on the lower leaf surface as minute, \n\nwhitish slightly raised spots about five or six days after inoculation. These \n\nspots enlarge to form mature reddish brown uredia which rupture the \n\nepidermis about two days later. Sporulation begins and the uredia may attain a \n\ndiameter of 1-2 mm about 8-12 days after inoculation. In some cases, \n\nsecondary and tertiary uredia develop around the perimeter of these primary \n\nuredia. The entire infection cycle occurs within approximately 10-15 days \n\n(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Souza et al. 2008). \n\n The reaction degrees to the disease are usually determined based on a \n\nscale of six infection degrees: 1- no pustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots \n\nwithout sporulation; 3 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &lt;\n\n300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 \n\n?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging \n\nfrom 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and 6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a \n\ndiameter of > 800 ?m (Stavely et al. 1983). \n\n The infection degrees are determined approximately about 10-15 days \n\nafter inoculation when up to 50 % of the pustules are sporulating. The lesions \n\nin both surfaces of the primary leaves should be determined visually by at \n\nleast two evaluators. The cultivars that predominantly presented degrees 3 or \n\nlower were classified as resistant, whereas those with predominant degrees 4 \n\nor higher are considered to be susceptible. \n\n\n\n \n\n 50\n\n4.  Pathosystem U. appendiculatus\u2013P. vulgaris \n\n \n\n4.1.  Host-pathogen coevolution \n\nAlloenzymes studies, variation patterns of the common bean seed protein \n\nphaseolin, and morphological evidences revealed the existence of a \n\nMesoamerican and an Andean gene pool in common bean (Gepts et al. 1986; \n\nSingh et al. 1991a, 1991b). The Andean cultivars originated in the Andean \n\nregion of South America, while the Mesoamerican beans were domesticated \n\nfrom wild populations in Mexico and Central America. \n\n Using phenotypic (virulence diversity) and genotypic (RAPD markers) \n\nanalyses of 90 U. appendiculatus isolates from thirteen Latin American \n\ncountries, Araya et al. (2004) were able to divide them into two major groups, \n\nnamely the Andean and the Mesoamerican, and one intermediate group.  In \n\ngeneral, Andean and Mesoamerican isolates showed virulence specificity to \n\nlandraces belonging to their respective gene pools, however, the Andean \n\nisolates tended to display greater geographic specificity than the \n\nMesoamerican isolates. This phenomenon, previously observed by Sandlin et \n\nal. (1999), suggests a parallel evolution in the bean rust pathosystem. The \n\nintermediate virulence group of U. appendiculatus races, observed by \n\nBraithwaite et al. (1994), Maclean et al. (1995), Sandlin et al. (1999), and \n\nAraya et al. (2004), provide evidence of a transition area between these two \n\ngene pools in both the common bean host and the rust pathogen. It is therefore \n\npossible that ongoing adaptation between pathogen and host will eventually \n\ninclude isolates from the intermediate group into the other two major groups \n\n(Araya et al. 2004). \n\n The virulence pattern analysis of 41 U. appendiculatus isolates from \n\nBrazil, demonstrated they were compatible with both Mesoamerican and \n\nAndean common bean cultivars (Souza et al. 2005a) suggesting that these \n\nisolates belong to the intermediate virulence group.       \n\n\n\n \n\n 51\n\n4.2.  Genetics of the rust resistance in common bean \n\nResistance to bean rust can be controlled by major single dominant genes \n\n(Augustin et al. 1972; Ballantyne 1978; Christ and Groth 1982a; Sayler et al. \n\n1995; Corr\u00eaa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a, 2000b; Alzate-Marin et al. \n\n2004; Souza et al. 2007b, 2007c), single recessive gene (Zaiter et al. 1989), \n\ntwo genes (Finke et al. 1986), two complementary dominant genes (Grafton et \n\nal. 1985), or by genes with minor effect (Edington et al. 1994). The gene-to-\n\ngene relationship proposed by Flor (1971) has been shown to occur in the U. \n\nappendiculatus\u2013P. vulgaris interaction (Christ and Groth 1982a, 1982b). \n\nResistance genes effective against multiple races of the pathogen are \n\norganized in clusters or complex loci (Stavely 1984b; Stavely and Grafton \n\n1985).  To date at least 13 dominant RR genes have been identified (genes Ur-\n\n1 to Ur-13), which are described in Table 3. These genes are named according \n\nto a nomenclature proposed by Kelly et al. (1996). In addition to these 13 \n\ngenes, other important unnamed RR genes, in \u2018BAC6\u2019 (Jung et al. 1996), \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 (Corr\u00eaa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a), \u2018Dorado\u2019 (Miklas et \n\nal. 2000, 2002), and \u2018PI 260418\u2019 (Pastor-Corrales 2005; Pastor-Corrales et al. \n\n2008) have been identified.  The proper characterization of the RR genes from \n\nMesoamerican and Andean gene pools is essential for the future of the \n\ncommon bean breeding aiming rust resistance. It will broaden the spectra of \n\nthe RR genes presently used (Liebenberg et al. 2006; Pastor-Corrales et al. \n\n2008). \n\n \n\n5.  Gene Tagging \n\n \n\nSeveral RAPD markers associated with genes conferring resistance to rust in \n\ncommon bean have been identified, as described in Table 3. Many SCAR \n\nmarkers have been developed to increase the reproducibility of the RAPD \n\nmarkers (Table 3). These molecular markers have been used for mapping Ur \n\ngenes in the integrated common bean map (Freyre et al. 1998; Miklas et al. \n\n2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n 52\n\nTable 3.

Ur-3 and Ur-11, and also Ur-Dorado108 map \n\nto the end of LG B11, next to the Co-2 locus, which is related to resistance to \n\nanthracnose. Ur-BAC6 is located near to the Ur-7 locus, and they do not \n\nappear to be close to Ur-Dorado108, Ur-3, and Ur-11. The Andean genes Ur-\n\n4, Ur-6, Ur-9, Ur-12, and Ur-13 were mapped to LG B6, B11, B1, B7, and \n\nB8, respectively (Miklas et al. 2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006; \n\nWright et al. 2008).

For instance, \n\nthe Andean RR gene Ur-9 and the anthracnose resistance gene Co-1 co-\n\nlocalize on LG B1 (Kelly and Vallejo 2004; Miklas et al. 2006). The \n\nMesoamerican genes Ur-5 and Co-3/Co-9, and gene Ur-ON from cultivar \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and Co-10 co-localize on LG B4 (Faleiro et al. 2000b; Alzate-\n\nMarin et al. 2003), and Ur-3 co-localize with Co-2 on LG B11, suggesting that \n\nthese genes derived from common ancestral gene sequences (Geffroy et al. \n\n1999; Faleiro et al. 2000b, 2003; Miklas et al. 2006). Recent works show that \n\nSCAR SQ4 linked to the Co-2 anthracnose resistance gene is closely linked to \n\nUr-11 (Awale et al. 2008). \n\n The linkage groups designated as B1-to-B11 in the BJ common bean \n\ncore map correspond to the chromosomes 1-to-11, respectively (Pedrosa et al. \n\n2003, 2006, 2008). \n\n\n\n \n\n 56\n\n6.  Gene Pyramiding Aiming at Development of Common Bean Lines \n\nResistant to Rust \n\n \n\nThe use of resistant cultivars is certainly the main component of the integrated \n\nbean rust management. Pyramiding of resistance genes from both Andean and \n\nMesoamerican gene pools is an important strategy for developing \n\ncomplementary and durable resistance to a large number of U. appendiculatus \n\nraces (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Pastor-Corrales and Stavely 2002; \n\nAraya et al. 2004). The large number of virulence patterns of U. \n\nappendiculatus, some of which are unique to certain countries, requires the \n\nuse of specific resistance genes in different regions (Ballantyne 1978; Araya et \n\nal. 2004; Souza et al. 2005a; Liebenberg et al. 2006; Acevedo et al. 2008; \n\nAlleyne et al. 2008). \n\n Gene pyramiding using only conventional breeding methods has not \n\nbeen effective mainly due to the difficulties in selecting genotypes harboring \n\ndifferent resistance genes which demand multiple or serial inoculations of the \n\nsame plant or population (Michelmore 1995). This limitation affects the \n\nbreeding process as a whole and also decreases the accuracy and efficiency of \n\nthe selection process (Bigirimana and H\u00f6fte 2001; Souza et al. 2005d). \n\nEpistatic interactions between different resistance genes can also affect the \n\nselection process (Singh et al. 2001). \n\n These limitations can be overcome by the use of molecular markers \n\nlinked to the resistance genes. With the use of molecular markers not only the \n\nmultiple and sequential inoculations can be avoided but also the confounding \n\neffect of potential epistatic interactions among the different resistance genes \n\npresent in the same genetic background (Michelmore 1995; Bigirimana and \n\nH\u00f6fte 2001; Singh et al. 2001; Toenniessen et al. 2003). However, for each \n\nresistance allele a specific marker or markers need to be identified. The use of \n\nflanking markers tightly linked to the locus of interest makes selection even \n\nmore robust (Faleiro et al. 2003). \n\n\n\n \n\n 57\n\n Molecular markers can also be used to accelerate the recovery of the \n\nrecurrent parent\u2019s genome in backcross breeding programs. Simulation studies \n\nand real data indicate that only three or four backcrosses are necessary to \n\nrecover the recurrent parent\u2019s genome when molecular markers are used \n\n(Openshaw et al. 1994; Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). Separate \n\nbackcross programs assisted by molecular marker fingerprinting can be used \n\nfor the individual introgression of resistance genes in commercial cultivars. \n\nThis strategy can be the initial step for pyramiding of RR alleles. \n\n Experimental evidence demonstrates that gene pyramiding confers \n\nmore effective resistance to the host plant than that conferred by the sum of \n\nthe resistance present in the progenitor plants (Yoshimura et al. 1995; Huang \n\net al. 1997; Singh et al. 2001). According to Schafer and Roelfs (1985), the \n\nprobability that a pathogen will overcome a gene pyramid of four to six genes \n\nis extremely low. In order for this to happen, independent mutations in the \n\npathogen genome must occur and they should be combined in the same \n\ngenetic background, or they could occur simultaneously or sequentially in the \n\ngenome of a specific pathogen isolate. Nelson (1979) argues that resistance \n\nresulting from the partial action of several resistance genes exerts a low \n\nselection pressure on the pathogen and for this reason it tends to last for a long \n\nperiod of time. Although this concept is not fully accepted by the scientific \n\ncommunity there are experimental data supporting the existence of partial \n\neffects of different resistance genes in some pathosystems (Brondy et al. 1986; \n\nPedersen and Leath 1988). According to the theory presented the duration of \n\nresistance will depend on the number of genes to be overcome by the \n\npathogen. \n\n Epidemiology data also support the use of gene pyramiding as an \n\neffective strategy for disease control. According to Thrall and Burdon (2003), \n\nthere is an inverse correlation between pathogen fitness, as measured by the \n\nnumber of spores produced, and the number of avirulence genes present in its \n\ngenome. The authors observed that the pathogen populations which were able \n\nto infect a greater number of host populations were less aggressive than \n\n\n\n \n\n 58\n\npathogen populations which were able to infect a lower number of host \n\npopulations. This indicates that the inactivation of several avirulence genes in \n\nthe pathogen compromises its adaptability. This is a positive aspect from the \n\nepidemiological perspective because it indicates that gene pyramiding can \n\npotentially keep the disease below an economical damage level and also \n\nprevent its fast dissemination. \n\n The main steps of a gene pyramiding breeding program assisted by \n\nmolecular markers aiming at disease resistance are: (i) identification of the \n\nmost prevalent and virulent races of the pathogen in the region of interest and \n\ncharacterization of the most promising resistance sources for that region; (ii) \n\ndetermination of the disease resistance inheritance mode by crossing the \n\nresistance sources and the susceptible cultivar; (iii) identification of molecular \n\nmarkers tightly linked to the various disease resistance alleles; (iv) \n\ndevelopment of lines harboring the R genes and the molecular markers of \n\ninterest; this process is often done by backcrossing; (v) identification of \n\nmarkers that can specifically identify the resistance alleles to avoid false \n\npositives; and (vi) pyramiding of resistance alleles by intercrossing the lines \n\nobtained. During this process, the following activities must also be considered: \n\n(i) continuous characterization of the variability of the pathogen and the host; \n\n(ii) characterization and introduction of new resistance sources in the breeding \n\nprogram; and (iii) identification of molecular markers linked to the resistance \n\ngenes present in the new resistance sources (Alzate-Marin et al. 2005; Souza \n\net al. 2008). \n\n In the BIOAGRO-UFV Common Bean Breeding Program, molecular \n\nfingerprinting based on the RAPD-PCR technique has been used to accelerate \n\nthe development of common bean lines resistant to rust, anthracnose and \n\nangular leaf spot. Molecular marker-assisted selection has been also used to \n\ncombine the different resistance genes in a single genetic background (Faleiro \n\net al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). \n\n In the specific case of rust, the breeding program conduced at \n\nBIOAGRO/UFV is also using the MAS (molecular-assisted selection) for \n\n\n\n \n\n 59\n\ndeveloping lines with specific RR genes (Ur-ON, Ur-5, and Ur-11) aiming at \n\ntheir introgression and pyramiding in Brazilian commercial cultivars (Alzate-\n\nMarin et al. 2004; Faleiro et al. 2004; Souza et al. 2005d, 2007b; Ragagnin et \n\nal. 2009). Initially, the gene Ur-ON has been used as the only source for \n\nresistance to U. appendiculatus in that breeding program. The RAPD marker \n\nOPX11 (Faleiro et al. 2000a) and the SCAR markers SF10 and SBA08 have \n\nbeen used for the indirect selection of Ur-ON and  its introgression in the \n\ngenetic background \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 (Corr\u00eaa et al. 2000). Later on, another RR gene \n\nwas characterized, the gene Ur-11, which was then also introgressed into \n\n\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 (Souza et al. 2002). To assist the selection of Ur-11, the RAPD marker \n\nOPAE19 was validated in a F2 population derived from the cross \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \n\n\u2018Belmidak RR-3\u2019 (Alzate-Marin et al. 2004). Then, this marker was converted \n\ninto a SCAR marker (SCAR AE19) by Queiroz et al. (2004). In the study of \n\nSouza et al. (2007b) the SCAR marker SI19 was validated as linked to gene \n\nUr-5 from cultivar \u2018Mexico 309\u2019. It was also verified that this marker can be \n\nused for the indirect selection of gene Ur-5 in the presence of genes Ur-ON \n\nand Ur-11. \n\n Using separate backcross programs and gene pyramiding approaches \n\nassisted by molecular markers, the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding \n\nProgram was able to create advanced carioca-type common bean lines with \n\nwide and potentially durable resistance to U. appendiculatus. These lines show \n\nthe same resistance spectra present in the donor parents and no yield penalty in \n\nrelation to the commercial cultivars used as recurrent parents (Souza et al. \n\n2005b, 2009). \n\n The yield components of the common bean lines developed by the \n\nBIOAGRO/UFV are evaluated in at least two distinct growing seasons. The \n\nevaluation assays include resistant control lines and high yielding reference \n\ncultivars widely planted in Brazil. Randomized complete block or lattice \n\ndesigns with three repetitions (plots) are used. Each plot consists of two rows \n\neach 2.0 m long, spaced by 0.5 m, with about 15 seeds per meter. Fertilizer \n\napplication is done according to the recommendations for dry bean cultivation \n\n\n\n \n\n 60\n\nin the State of Minas Gerais. Harvest of the whole plot is done manually. The \n\nyield components usually evaluated are: grain yield, determined for each plot \n\nand expressed as g/plot or Kg/ha; plant height, the mean height (in \n\ncentimeters) of the plants at stage R8 in each plot; mean number of seeds per \n\npod in each plot; mean number of pods per plant in each plot (Ragagnin et al. \n\n2009). \n\n The lines selected based on molecular markers and yield components \n\nare also tested against the pathogen under greenhouse (specific races) and field \n\n(natural incidence) conditions. The lines with resistance spectra similar to \n\nthose of the donor parents and as productive as the recurrent parents and \n\ncontrol cultivars are evaluated in different regions by the Brazilian Bean \n\nAssay Network. If the superior agronomic performance of these lines is \n\nconfirmed they are recommended as new cultivars. In addition, the resistance \n\ngene pyramid can be transferred to other Brazilian commercial cultivars. \n\n \n\n7.  Perspectives \n\n \n\nYield and disease resistance are the main foci of common bean breeders \n\nthroughout the world. The large number of pathogens affecting this crop is one \n\nof the main causes of the low yield observed in many bean growing regions. \n\n The concept of gene pyramiding assisted by molecular markers has \n\nbeen successfully used by the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding \n\nProgram to create lines with wide and potentially durable resistance. Separate \n\nbackcross programs assisted by molecular markers have allowed the \n\nindividual introgression of resistance genes in recurrent cultivars after only \n\nthree or four backcross cycles. The lines obtained have shown the same \n\nresistance spectra present in the donor parents. Evaluation of yield \n\ncomponents of the advanced lines have demonstrated that no yield penalty in \n\nrelation to recurrent cultivars was observed after the pyramiding process \n\n(Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009; Souza et al. 2005b, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n 61\n\n To be effective, the gene pyramiding strategy must be a continuous \n\neffort. Permanent monitoring for the presence of new virulent races in the field \n\nand search for new resistance sources are inherent steps in this breeding \n\nstrategy. \n\n A significant variability of U. appendiculatus isolates has been \n\nobserved in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (Faleiro et al. 1998, 1999a; \n\nSouza et al. 2005a, 2007a). Isolates collected by these authors have been used \n\nto support the bean breeding programs of different research institutions in \n\nBrazil. As a result of this work, it was possible to select resistant cultivars, like \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 (Faleiro et al. 2000b; Vieira et al. 2005), and to develop other \n\ncultivars and advanced lines harboring rust resistance genes (Faleiro et al. \n\n2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). Periodical collection, maintenance and \n\nclassification of U. appendiculatus isolates are essential steps of the bean \n\nbreeding program as these steps inform about the variability of the pathogen in \n\na growing area over time. Thus new sources of resistance can be identified and \n\nvalidated with adequate monitoring and identification of the most frequent \n\nraces of the pathogen (Souza et al. 2007a). \n\n Frequent monitoring of prevalent races of pathogens presenting high \n\nvariability is very helpful in studies involving genetic dynamics, as the \n\ngeographical origin of the isolates may provide indirect evidences of their \n\ndiversity, because of their adaptation to different environment conditions. \n\n In this way, a consistent effort of monitoring and classification of U. \n\nappendiculatus isolates has been established in Minas Gerais, Brazil, to attend \n\nthe breeding programs of the \u201cMinas Gerais Common Bean Covenant\u201d. This \n\nagreement includes four instituitions: Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa (UFV), \n\nUniversidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA), Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria \n\nde Minas Gerais (EPAMIG), and Embrapa Arroz e Feij\u00e3o. This effort also \n\nincludes analyses of the geographical variability of U. appendiculatus in \n\nassociation with molecular markers. \n\n\n\n \n\n 62\n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding Program is supported by grants \n\nfrom CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e \n\nTecnol\u00f3gico) and FAPEMIG (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de \n\nMinas Gerais) \u2013 Brazilian Government.

The Mesoamerican black seeded \n\ncommon bean cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 is the main rust resistance (RR) source \n\nused in Brazil.  It is resistant to U. appendiculatus isolates from different bean \n\ngrowing areas of the country.  However, the RR gene present in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, \n\ntemporally named as Ur-ON, has not been fully characterized yet.  The main \n\ngoal of the present work was to characterize the gene Ur-ON.  We have \n\ncompared the RR spectrum presented by \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 with those of other \n\nbean lines harboring known RR genes when inoculated with nine selected \n\nraces of U. appendiculatus.  In addition, all bean lines were screened with \n\nmolecular markers linked to Ur-ON aiming to identify additional evidence for \n\nthe presence of alleles for this locus in the screened RR sources.  Finally, we \n\ntested the allelic relationships of Ur-ON with already characterized RR genes \n\nfrom lines resistant to at least one race of the pathogen.  We also accomplished \n\nallelism tests between \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018CNC\u2019 and \u2018CSW 643\u2019, important \n\nRR sources in Brazil harboring unnamed RR genes.  The results showed that \n\nthe major dominant gene conditioning RR in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 is positioned at a \n\nlocus distinct from those with which it was compared.  We propose that this \n\ngene \u2013 or complex gene locus \u2013 is unique and be designated Ur-14. \n\n \n\nKey words:  Allelism test \u2013 molecular markers \u2013 resistance genes \u2013 Uromyces \n\nappendiculatus \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris  \n\n\n\n \n\n 75\n\n1.  Introduction \n\n \n\nCommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the main source of vegetable protein, \n\nminerals, and vitamins for a large fraction of the Brazilians. The economical, \n\nnutritional, and social value of the bean crop to millions of people in many \n\nother countries of Latin America, and Eastern and Southern Africa is \n\nunquestionable (Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). \n\n Rust is a bean fungal disease incited by Uromyces appendiculatus F. \n\nStrauss (sin. U. phaseoli G. Winter). Although this fungus is distributed \n\nworldwide, it effectively causes major production problems in humid tropical \n\nand subtropical areas and periodic severe epidemics in humid temperate \n\nregions (Souza et al. 2008).  Severe bean rust epidemics have been reported in \n\nLatin America, Australia, China, the United States, and some areas of Europe \n\n(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989).  The major losses in Brazil occur in south, \n\nsoutheast and central areas, including the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, \n\nSanta Catarina, Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Goi\u00e1s (Souza et al. 2005a).  \n\nRecommended disease management practices for bean rust control include \n\ncrop rotation, planting within recommended dates, growing resistant cultivars, \n\nand timely spraying of fungicides (Mmbaga et al. 1996).  Chemical products \n\nare hardly used due to the need of specific technical knowledge and also \n\nbecause they increase the production costs.  Besides, chemical products are \n\noften an ecotoxicological concern.  The use of resistant cultivars is an \n\nefficient, safe, and inexpensive alternative accessible to bean growers for the \n\neffective rust control. \n\n Thirteen dominant rust resistance (RR) genes were identified to date \n\n(Ur-1\u2013to\u2013Ur-13). These genes are named according to the nomenclature \n\nproposed by Kelly et al. (1996).  In addition to them, other important unnamed \n\ngenes have been identified, such as those present in the common bean lines \n\n\u2018BAC6\u2019, \u2018CNC\u2019, \u2018CSW 643\u2019, \u2018Dorado\u2019, \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, and \u2018PI 260418\u2019 \n\n(reviewed in Souza et al. 2008).  The appropriate characterization of RR genes \n\nfrom different origins (Mesoamerican and Andean) is essential for the future \n\n\n\n \n\n 76\n\nof the common bean breeding aiming resistance to U. appendiculatus, because \n\nit should broaden the spectra of the genes currently used (Liebenberg et al. \n\n2006).  Besides, new sources of resistance must always be identified and \n\ncharacterized because of the high virulence diversity and variability present in \n\nthe pathogen population (Araya et al. 2004; Liebenberg et al. 2006; Souza et \n\nal. 2007).  The Mesoamerican cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 was developed by CIAT \n\n(Cali, Colombia) and initially named \u2018Honduras 35\u2019, in 1991 this bean line \n\nwas introduced in Brazil as cultivar \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 (Ara\u00fajo et al. 1991). This \n\nblack seeded common bean line showed resistance to several isolates of U. \n\nappendiculatus in Brazil (Faleiro et al. 1999, 2000a; Souza et al. 2007) and in \n\nthe USA (Alzate-Marin et al. 2004).  In addition, it is resistant to races 73, 81, \n\nand 89 of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. &amp; Magnus) Lams.-Scrib., the \n\ncausal agent of bean anthracnose (Alzate-Marin et al. 2003), and resistant to \n\nraces 63-63 and 63-23 of Pseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous &amp; U. \n\nBraun, the causal agent of angular leaf spot (Sanglard et al. 2009). \n\n Previous works conducted by our research group showed that \u2018Ouro \n\nNegro\u2019 possesses single resistance genes to rust and anthracnose located 12.3 \n\ncM apart on the same linkage group (Faleiro et al. 2000b).  The independence \n\nof the anthracnose resistance gene in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 has been proven and it was \n\ndesignated Co-10 (Alzate-Marin et al. 2003).  Information is lacking on the \n\nindependence of the RR gene in this cultivar, which has been temporary \n\nnamed as Ur-OuroNegro or Ur-ON.  It is the principal RR gene used in Brazil \n\nfor breeding purposes (Faleiro et al. 2004; Souza et al. 2008; Ragagnin et al. \n\n2009). \n\n The main goal of the present work was to characterize the \n\nMesoamerican RR gene Ur-ON.  We have done a comparative analysis of the \n\nresistance spectra presented by \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and by bean lines harboring \n\nknown RR genes which were inoculated with selected Brazilian races of U. \n\nappendiculatus.  These races are used by our breeding program at the \n\nUniversidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa - UFV, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to select \n\ngenotypes resistant to the pathogen.  In addition, all RR sources have been \n\n\n\n \n\n 77\n\nscreened with molecular markers reported as linked to Ur-ON aiming to \n\nidentify additional evidence for the presence/absence of resistance alleles for \n\nthis locus in the tested bean lines.  Finally, when possible, we also studied the \n\nallelic relationships of Ur-ON with already characterized RR genes and with \n\nthe unnamed genes present in \u2018CNC\u2019 and \u2018CSW 643\u2019, important RR sources to \n\nbe explored in Brazil (Souza et al. 2005a). \n\n \n\n2.  Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n2.1.  Genetic material and crosses \n\nSeeds from cultivars \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, \u2018US Pinto 111\u2019 (susceptible control), \u2018AxS \n\n37\u2019, \u2018CNC\u2019, \u2018CSW 643\u2019, and the RR sources listed in Table 1 were provided \n\nby the Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV (Vi\u00e7osa, MG, Brazil). \n\nThe crosses were performed in the greenhouse.  F1 seeds were sowed \n\nand the corresponding F1 plants generated the F2 and F3 generations.  \u2018Ouro \n\nNegro\u2019 was used as the male parent, except in the cross with \u2018PI181996\u2019.  To \n\nidentify the true hybrids, all F1 plants were analyzed morphologically (flower \n\ncolor).  The F1 plants derived from the crosses between \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \n\nother black seeded cultivars (\u2018PI181996\u2019, \u2018Mexico 309\u2019, and \u2018CNC\u2019) were also \n\nanalyzed with RAPD markers according to Alzate-Marin et al. (1996).  The \n\npresence in a F1 plant of a PCR product which was present only in the male \n\nparent confirmed that this F1 plant was indeed a hybrid. \n\n \n\n2.2.  U. appendiculatus races and inoculation  \n\nThe selected Brazilian U. appendiculatus mono-pustule isolates used in this \n\nwork were characterized and classified into physiological races by Souza et al. \n\n(2007).  They are maintained in the fungal collection of the BIOAGRO/UFV \n\nCommon Bean Breeding Program.  To increase and keep the viability of the \n\ninoculum, the spores of the pathogen stored under low humidity at 4\u00b0C and \n\nprotected from light were first inoculated on leaves of the susceptible cultivar \n\n\u2018US Pinto 111\u2019.  Newly generated spores were used in the inoculation assays. \n\n\n\n \n\n 78\n\nTable 1.

In addition to the F2 and F3 plants used for allelism tests, about ten \n\nplants from each RR source and control cultivar were inoculated with the \n\npathogen for the comparative analysis of their resistance spectra.  The \n\ninoculum concentration was 2.0 \u00d7 104 uredospores/mL distilled water \n\ncontaining Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The inoculum solution was sprayed on \n\nboth leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an \n\nelectric compressor.  After inoculation the plants were transferred to a mist \n\nchamber (20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and relative humidity > 95%) where they were kept for \n\napproximately 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  In order to avoid \n\ncontamination, plants inoculated with different isolates were kept in separate \n\ncompartments of the mist chamber.  After this period the plants were \n\ntransferred to a greenhouse (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C), where they were kept until symptom \n\nevaluation, about 15 days after the inoculation. \n\n \n\n2.3.  Disease evaluation \n\nRust symptoms were determined approximately 15 days after inoculation, \n\nwhen about 50 % of the pustules had sporulated.  The disease evaluation was \n\ncarried out based on a six-degree scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983): 1- no \n\npustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots without sporulation; 3 - pustules \n\nundergoing sporulation with a diameter of &lt;300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing \n\nsporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 ?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules \n\nundergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and \n\n6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of > 800 ?m. \n\nThe lesions on both surfaces of the inoculated leaves were evaluated \n\nvisually by at least two researchers.  The common bean cultivars or individual \n\nplants from the segregating populations that predominantly presented degree 3 \n\nor lower were classified as resistant, whereas those with predominant degree 4 \n\nor higher were considered susceptible. \n\n\n\n \n\n 81\n\n2.4.

DNA \n\namplification by the RAPD technique was according to Faleiro et al. (2000a).  \n\nAmplification reactions using SCAR markers were as described by C\u00f4rrea et \n\nal. (2000).  The amplified products were visualized under UV light after \n\nelectrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 \n\n?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium \n\nhydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).   \n\n \n\n2.5.

Results \n\n \n\n3.1.  Reaction of RR sources to selected races of U. appendiculatus \n\nOut of the 17 RR sources tested against the pathogen (Table 3), seven were \n\nsusceptible to all nine selected races of U. appendiculatus, so was the control \n\ncultivar \u2018US Pinto 111\u2019.  Among the RR sources there are the common bean \n\nlines harboring the Andean genes Ur-4 (\u2018Early Gallatin\u2019), Ur-6 (\u2018Golden Gate \n\nWax\u2019), Ur-6+ (\u2018Pinto Olathe\u2019; Andean gene in a Mesoamerican background, \n\nsee Table 1), Ur-8 (\u2018U.S. #3\u2019), and Ur-10 (\u2018Resisto\u2019), and the Mesoamerican \n\ngenes Ur-3 (\u2018Aurora\u2019) and Ur-7 (\u2018GN 1140\u2019).  The resistance spectra \n\npresented by these lines indicate that Ur-ON is independent from the genes \n\nUr-3, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-6+, Ur-7, Ur-8, and Ur-10.  The other sources were \n\nresistant to at least one race of the pathogen (Table 3).  For this reason they \n\nwere crossed with \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 aiming to study the allelic relationship \n\nbetween their RR genes and Ur-ON.  Like \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, the Mesoamerican \n\ncultivars \u2018AxS 37\u2019 (Ur-22), \u2018PI181996\u2019 (Ur-11), and \u2018CSW 643\u2019 (Ur-?), and \n\nthe Andean cultivar \u2018Brown Beauty\u2019 (Ur-4), were resistant to all tested U. \n\nappendiculatus races (Table 3).  These results suggest that allelism tests \n\nbetween these cultivars and \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 are greatly needed.       \n\n \n\n3.2.

These results suggest that the RR gene present in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 \n\ndoes not have allelic relationship with genes Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-7, \n\nUr-10, Ur-11, and Ur-13. \n\n\n\n \n\n 84\n\nTable 3.

Allelism tests \n\nIn the allelism tests with the F2 populations derived from crosses between \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018Ecuador 299\u2019 (Ur-3+), \u2018Mexico 235\u2019 (Ur-3+), \u2018Brown \n\nBeauty\u2019 (Ur-4), \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 (Ur-5), \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019 (Ur-11), \u2018PI181996\u2019 \n\n(Ur-11), and \u2018CSW 643\u2019 (Ur-?), the segregation ratios of RR were of 15 \n\nresistant to 1 susceptible plant (15R:1S) (Table 4).  These results show that \n\ntwo independent dominant genes governed RR in each population and that the \n\nresistance gene present in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 segregated independently of the \n\nresistance loci Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-5, Ur-11, and the unnamed locus (Ur-?) of \n\n\u2018CSW 643\u2019. \n\n The segregation ratio of RR in the F3 population derived from the cross \n\nbetween \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018Redlands Pioneer\u2019 (Ur-13) was 55R:9S (Table 4), \n\nindicating that two independent dominant genes governed resistance in this \n\npopulation. \n\n In the F2 population derived from the cross between \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \n\n\u2018CNC\u2019 the segregation ratio was 63R:1S (Table 4), indicating that three \n\nindependent dominant genes conditioned resistance in this cross.  In the F2 \n\npopulation derived from the crosses between \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018AxS 37\u2019 (Ur-\n\n22), and \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018PC-50\u2019 (Ur-9), the segregation ratios were 57R:7S \n\n(Table 4), indicating that three independent dominant genes determined \n\nresistance in these crosses and two of the genes are complementary.  In this \n\ncase Ur-ON could be one of the complementary genes. \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n 86\n\nTable 4.

Discussion \n\n \n\nInheritance studies previously developed by our research group and additional \n\ndata reported by the present work show that a major dominant gene \u2013 or \n\ncomplex gene locus \u2013 confers resistance to rust in \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 (Table 4).  \n\nThe temporary symbol Ur-ON was assigned to this gene because it had not \n\nbeen fully characterized.  Allelism studies reported by Alzate-Marin et al. \n\n(2004) showed that Ur-ON does not correspond to genes Ur-5 (\u2018Mexico 309\u2019) \n\nor Ur-11 (\u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019) (Table 4).  Ur-ON is also different from the \n\nMesoamerican dominant genes Ur-1 (\u2018B1627\u2019) and Ur-2 (\u2018B2090\u2019) identified \n\nby Ballantyne (1978).  These are obsolete RR genes supplanted by the \n\nmajority of the U. appendiculatus races.  Seed stocks for the lines \u2018B1627\u2019 and \n\n\u2018B2090\u2019 that harbor these genes no longer exist.  In addition, Ur-ON does not \n\ncorrespond to the gene Ur-12 (\u2018PC-50\u2019) that conditions adult plant resistance \n\nexpressed at the fourth bean trifoliate stage (Jung et al. 1998), since Ur-ON \n\nconfers seedling rust resistance (Corr\u00eaa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a, 2003). \n\n In the present work we further characterized Ur-ON in relation to other \n\nRR genes previously identified (Ur-22, Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-5, Ur-6, Ur-6+, \n\nUr-7, Ur-8, Ur-9, Ur-10, Ur-11, and Ur-13; see Table 1) and the genes present \n\nin the bean lines \u2018CNC\u2019 and \u2018CSW 643\u2019, important RR sources to be explored \n\nin Brazil (Souza et al. 2005a).  We did a comparative analysis of the resistance \n\nspectra presented by \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and by other 17 RR sources when \n\ninoculated with nine selected Brazilian races of U. appendiculatus.  These \n\nraces are currently used by our common bean breeding program to select \n\nresistant bean lines.  The resistance spectra analysis indicated that Ur-ON is \n\nindependent from the genes Ur-3, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-6+, Ur-7, Ur-8, and Ur-10 \n\nbecause unlike Ur-ON these genes did not confer resistance to any of the \n\ntested U. appendiculatus races (Table 3). \n\n In addition, we also screened all RR sources with molecular markers \n\nreported as linked to Ur-ON (Table 2) aiming to identify additional evidence \n\nfor the presence/absence of resistance alleles for the locus Ur-ON in the \n\n\n\n \n\n 88\n\nscreened bean lines.  The results suggested that Ur-ON does not have allelic \n\nrelationship with the genes Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-7, Ur-10, Ur-11, and \n\nUr-13 because the bean lines harboring these genes did not present any of the \n\nDNA markers (Table 3).  In this assay marker OPX11 showed to be specific \n\nfor Ur-ON.  This marker can be used to select Ur-ON during its pyramiding \n\nwith any of the RR genes listed in Table 3.  Previous attempts to convert \n\nOPX11 into a SCAR marker were unsuccessful (C\u00f4rrea et al. (2000)), but we \n\nare currently pursuing this objective.  SCAR markers have the advantage to be \n\nhighly reproducible and can be used in a multiplex PCR analysis since they \n\nidentify specific loci. \n\n Finally, we also studied the allelic relationship of Ur-ON with some of \n\nthe already characterized RR genes and with the unnamed genes present in \n\n\u2018CNC\u2019 and \u2018CSW 643\u2019.  The allelism tests demonstrated that \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 \n\ncarries one dominant gene segregating independently of Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, \n\nUr-5, Ur-11, and Ur-13, and of the resistance genes present in \u2018CNC\u2019 and \n\n\u2018CSW 643\u2019 (Table 4).  \n\n It was verified that the RR gene present in the common bean cultivar \n\n\u2018Ouro Negro\u2019, temporarilly named as Ur-ON, is distinct from the other RR \n\ngenes already characterized.  In addition, Ur-ON does not have allelic \n\nrelationships with the resistance genes present in \u2018CNC\u2019 and \u2018CSW 643\u2019. \n\nBased on the evidences for independence of Ur-ON reported in the present \n\nwork, we propose that this gene is unique and be named as Ur-14.  We have \n\nalready submitted our proposal to the Genetics Committee of the Bean \n\nImprovement Cooperative - BIC (http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/) to be officially \n\nanalyzed. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nFinancial support to this work was provided by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de \n\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico) and FAPEMIG (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nAmparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais); Brazilian Government.

Among them is rust, which is \n\nincited by the fungus Uromyces appendiculatus.  In our breeding program we \n\nused a gene pyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers aiming to develop \n\nbean lines with durable and ample resistance to this pathogen. The rust \n\nresistance genes Ur-5 (from \u2018Mexico 309\u2019), Ur-11 (from \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019), \n\nand Ur-ON (from a carioca-type line \u2018Vi-4899\u2019) were combined in the \n\ncarioca-type bean cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019.  Initially, two different backcross programs \n\nwere conducted separately to produce carioca-type progenies harboring \n\nindividually the genes Ur-5 and Ur-11.  Molecular fingerprinting analysis was \n\nused to select plants genetically closer to \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 in the backcross cycles to \n\naccelerate the recurrent-background recovery.  The progenies obtained were \n\nintercrossed and then crossed with \u2018Vi-4899\u2019 (Ur-ON), using a tri-cross \n\ndesign. The resulting plants were screened with the molecular markers \n\nSI19460C (Ur-5), SAE19890R (Ur-11) and OPX11550C (Ur-ON) to identify those \n\ncontaining all the alleles of interest.  The selected plants were selfed to obtain \n\nthe next generations.  The selection based on DNA markers was conducted up \n\nto the F4:5 generation. We were able to select F4:7 progenies showing all the \n\nDNA markers associated to the genes of interest and resistant to all U. \n\nappendiculatus isolates tested. They were also resistant under field conditions.  \n\nYield evaluations show that these selected lines are as productive as the \n\nrecurrent parent \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 and other high performing cultivars currently grown in \n\nBrazil. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 94\n\nKey words:  Uromyces appendiculatus \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris \u2013 disease \n\nresistance \u2013 marker-assisted selection \u2013 agronomic performance \u2013 plant \n\nbreeding \n\n \n\n1.  Introduction \n\n \n\nCommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an economically, nutritionally, and \n\nsocially important crop, especially in developing countries of Latin America, \n\nEastern and Southern Africa.  It is grown and consumed worldwide in distinct \n\nareas and different seasons, mainly by subsistence level farmers with low-\n\ntechnology input but also by farmers that use high input technologies (Pachico \n\n1989; Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003).  Dry bean cultivars were \n\ngrown on approximately 27 million hectares in more than 120 countries in \n\n2007, but their yield is quite low compared to other important grain legumes \n\nsuch as soybean and peas (http://faostat.fao.org).  One of the several factors \n\ncontributing to this situation is the high number of destructive diseases that \n\nattack P. vulgaris.  Among them is the common bean rust, incited by the \n\nbasidomycete fungus Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss (syn. U. phaseoli \n\nG. Winter), which can cause great yield losses.  This fungus is a highly \n\nvariable and is among the most pathogenically variable of all plant pathogens \n\n(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989). \n\nBean rust is distributed around the world, but it effectively causes major \n\nproduction problems in humid tropical and subtropical areas.  Severe \n\nepidemics have been reported in Australia, China, the United States, and some \n\nareas of Europe.  Major losses have occurred in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, \n\nMalawi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  In Latin \n\nAmerica, the bean rust is also a serious problem, major losses occurred in \n\nArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, \n\nEcuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, \n\nNicaragua, and Peru (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Souza et al. 2008).  In \n\nBrazil, the disease causes major losses in south, southeast and central areas, \n\n\n\n \n\n 95\n\nincluding the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Minas \n\nGerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Goi\u00e1s (Souza et al. 2005).  Rust losses worldwide \n\nmeasured in greenhouse and field conditions can vary from 18 to 100% \n\n(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Staples 2000).  Yield losses higher than \n\n68% were detected in Minas Gerais state in southeastern Brazil (Vieira et al. \n\n2005). \n\n No single control or disease management measure can be recommended \n\nfor rust.  Management of this disease has relied primarily on three strategies: \n\napplication of fungicides, host resistance, and various cultural practices.  The \n\nuse of resistant cultivars is certainly the main component of the integrated \n\nbean rust management.  The pyramiding of different race-specific resistance \n\ngenes is an important strategy for developing broad and durable resistance to \n\nU. appendiculatus (Souza et al. 2008; Raganin et al. 2009). This approach \n\nusing only conventional breeding methods has not been effective mainly due \n\nto the difficulties in selecting genotypes harboring different resistance genes.  \n\nFor this reason, molecular markers are often used to aid the pyramiding \n\nprocess.  The use of molecular markers not only eliminates the need for \n\nmultiple and sequential inoculations but also the confounding effect of \n\npotential epistatic interactions among the different resistance genes present in \n\nthe same genetic background (Michelmore 1995; Bigirimana and H\u00f6fte 2001; \n\nSingh et al. 2001; Toenniessen et al. 2003).  However, for each resistance \n\nallele a specific marker or markers need to be identified.   Several RAPD \n\nmarkers associated with genes conferring resistance to rust in common bean \n\nhave been identified and some of them were converted into SCAR markers to \n\nincrease their reproducibility (Souza et al. 2008). \n\n Molecular markers can also be used to accelerate the recovery of the \n\nrecurrent parent\u2019s genome in backcross breeding programs.  Simulation \n\nstudies and real data indicate that only three or four backcrosses are necessary \n\nto recover the recurrent parent\u2019s genome when molecular markers are used \n\n(Openshaw et al. 1994; Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009).  Separate \n\nbackcross programs assisted by molecular marker fingerprinting can be used \n\n\n\n \n\n 96\n\nfor the individual introgression of resistance genes in commercial cultivars.  \n\nThis strategy can be the initial step for pyramiding rust resistance alleles. \n\n The main goal of the present work was to develop high yielding \n\ncarioca-type common bean lines with broad and durable resistance to U. \n\nappendiculatus. Carioca seeded beans are the most consumed in Brazil.  \n\nBackcross programs were conducted separately to produce genetic materials \n\nharboring individual rust resistance alleles.  DNA fingerprinting was used to \n\naccelerate the recurrent-background recovery. Molecular marker-assisted \n\nselection was used to combine the distinct rust resistance genes in the carioca-\n\ntype genetic background.  The agronomic performance of the advanced lines \n\nobtained was evaluated in two growing seasons and the presence of the \n\nresistance alleles was confirmed by inoculations with the rust pathogen. \n\n \n\n2.  Material and Methods \n\n \n\n2.1.  Plant genetic material \n\nThe Mesoamerican carioca-type common bean cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 was used as \n\nrecurrent parent in all backcrosses.  It has been highly recommended for many \n\ngrowing regions in Brazil, but it is susceptible to rust.  \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 and \n\n\u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019 (derived from \u2018PI181996\u2019) were used as donor parents.  \n\nThey are Mesoamerican bean lines harboring genes Ur-5 and Ur-11, \n\nrespectively, that confer ample resistance to U. appendiculatus in Brazil \n\n(Souza et al. 2005, 2007a) and in other parts of the world (Stavely 2000; \n\nSteadman et al. 2002).  The common bean line \u2018Vi-4899\u2019, derived from the \n\ncross \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 by molecular marker-assisted backcrosses \n\n(Faleiro et al. 2004), was also used as donor parent in the gene pyramiding \n\nprocess.  This carioca seeded line recently released in Brazil as the cultivar \n\n\u2018BRSMG Pioneiro\u2019 (Moreira et al. 2006) harbors the gene Ur-ON from \u2018Ouro \n\nNegro\u2019. It is resistant to several isolates of U. appendiculatus and \n\nColletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. &amp; Magnus) Lams.-Scrib., the causal \n\nagent of bean anthracnose (Faleiro et al. 2004). \n\n\n\n \n\n 97\n\n2.2.  Crosses \n\nAll crosses were conducted in the greenhouse.  Two separate backcross (BC) \n\nprograms were conducted until BC3 generations using \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 as recurrent \n\nparent and cultivars \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 or \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019 as donor parents.  \n\nAfter each BC the plants were screened with the rust pathogen according to \n\nitem 2.3 and the genetic distances between the resistant plants and the \n\nrecurrent parent were determined with RAPD markers.  The plants closest to \n\n\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 were used for the next BC cycle.  The BC3F1 plants selected based on \n\nthese criteria were selfed to obtain the BC3F2 population that was inoculated \n\nwith U. appendiculatus and screened with molecular markers linked to the \n\ngenes of interest (Table 1).  The resistant BC3F2 plants presenting the DNA \n\nmarkers were selfed to obtain BC3F2:3 progenies which were submitted to \n\nprogeny tests based on inoculation with the pathogen. \n\nBC3F2:3 progenies homozygous for resistance to rust were selected for \n\nthe pyramiding process (Figure 1).  This process was done using a tri-cross \n\ndesign consisted basically of two steps: step 1 - pairwise crosses among the \n\nBC3F2:3 resistant progenies to obtain single-hybrids; step 2 - crosses of the \n\nsingle-hybrids with the common bean line \u2018Vi-4899\u2019 to obtain the triple-\n\nhybrids with the three resistance genes of interest.  The triple-hybrid plants \n\nwere screened with the markers SI19 (gene Ur-5) and OPX11 (gene Ur-ON) \n\nto confirm the cross.  Plants harboring both markers were selfed to obtain the \n\nsubsequent generations.  The F2, F3, F4 and F4:5 plants derived from the triple-\n\nhybrids were also selected with molecular markers specifically linked to each \n\none of the rust resistance genes, which were identified in a preliminary \n\ngenotyping test of the parental cultivars.  F4:5 seeds from the selected F4 plants \n\nwere multiplied and the resulting plants were used for progeny tests based on \n\nscreening with molecular markers to identify homozygous families for the rust \n\nresistance loci Ur-5, Ur-11, and Ur-ON (Figure 2). \n\n\n\n \n\n 98\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1.

Pathogen inoculation and disease evaluation \n\nBrazilian U. appendiculatus mono-pustule isolates used in this work were \n\ncharacterized and classified into physiological races by Souza et al. (2007a).  \n\nThey are maintained in the fungal collection of the BIOAGRO/UFV Common \n\nBean Breeding Program.  Artificial inoculations were carried out when the \n\nprimary leaves of the bean plants reached approximately 2/3 of their full \n\ndevelopment, about 10 days after sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 \u00b1 \n\n5\u00b0C), as described previously (Souza et al. 2007a).  Each one of the BCnF1 and \n\nBC3F2 plants and 12 plants each of the tested progenies (BC3F2:3 families and \n\nF4:7 pyramid lines) and of a control cultivar were inoculated (Figures 1 and 2).  \n\nThe inoculum concentration was 2.0 \u00d7 104 uredospores/mL distilled water \n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7BC3F2:3 (Ur-11) Rud\u00e1 \u00d7 BelMiDak RR-3 \n\nF1 (Ur-5 and Ur-11) \nAnalysis with \nSI19 (Ur-5) to \nconfirm cross \n\nSelection with markers: \n   SI19 (Ur-5) \n   OPX11 (Ur-ON) \n\nF1 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\nField tests to evaluate grain \nyield and reaction to rust \n\nField tests, screening of the \nbest yielding progenies with \nthe three molecular markers \nand inoculation with specific \nisolates of U. appendiculatus\n\nSelection with markers \nused in previous step \n\nBC3F2:3 (Ur-5) \nRud\u00e1 \u00d7 Mexico 309 \n\nVi-4899 (Ur-ON) \nRud\u00e1 \u00d7 Ouro Negro \n\nSelection with markers: \n   SI19 (Ur-5) \n   SAE19 (Ur-11) \n   OPX11 (Ur-ON) \n\nF2 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\nF4 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\nF4:5 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\n \n\nMultiplication of seeds and \nprogeny test based on \nscreening with markers used \nin previous step \n\nF4:6 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\n?\n\n \n\nF4:7 (Ur-5, Ur-11 and Ur-ON) \n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\n \n\n 101\n\ncontaining Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The inoculum solution was sprayed on \n\nboth leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an \n\nelectric compressor.  After inoculation the plants were transferred to a mist \n\nchamber (20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and relative humidity > 95%) where they were kept for \n\napproximately 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  In order to avoid \n\ncontamination, plants inoculated with different isolates were kept in separate \n\ncompartments of the mist chamber.  After this period the plants were \n\ntransferred to a greenhouse (20 \u00b1 5\u00b0C), where they were kept until symptom \n\nevaluation, about 15 days after inoculation. \n\nSix grades of rust reaction were considered in the evaluation of the \n\ndisease symptoms based on the scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983): 1- no \n\npustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots without sporulation; 3 - pustules \n\nundergoing sporulation with a diameter of &lt;300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing \n\nsporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 ?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules \n\nundergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and \n\n6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of > 800 ?m.  Reaction \n\ngrades to the pathogen were determined visually by at least two researchers.  \n\nPlants with grades 1 and 2 were considered resistant (R), those with grade 3 \n\nwere considered to be moderately resistance (MR), plants presenting grade 4 \n\nwere considered moderately susceptible (MS), and those with grade 5 or 6 \n\nwere considered to be susceptible (S). \n\n \n\n2.4.  DNA marker analysis \n\nLeaf DNA was extracted according to Doyle and Doyle (1990).  In each \n\nbackcross cycle a screening was done to identify polymorphic RAPD primers \n\n(Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) to be used in the molecular \n\nfingerprinting assays.  The primers that revealed at least one polymorphic \n\nDNA band among the analyzed plants were selected.  DNA amplification by \n\nRAPD technique was according to Faleiro et al. (2000).  The polymorphic and \n\nmonomorphic DNA bands were used to build a matrix based on the presence \n\n(1) or absence (0) of bands.  The genetic similarity values were calculated by \n\n\n\n \n\n 102\n\nthe Euclidian method for binary data and used to cluster the plants by the \n\nnearest neighbor method with the aid of the program GENES (Cruz 2006). \n\n For the molecular marker-assisted selection, including the progeny test \n\nto identify F4:5 pyramid families homozygous for the rust resistance loci, \n\nRAPD and SCAR markers specifically linked to each one of the resistance \n\ngenes were used.  In the assays with the SCAR technique, the DNA \n\namplification reactions were as described by C\u00f4rrea et al. (2000).  The \n\nannealing temperatures for the markers are described in Table 1. \n\nThe amplified products were visualized under UV light after \n\nelectrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 \n\n?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium \n\nhydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).   \n\n \n\n2.5.  Agronomic performance \n\nTwo field experiments were conducted at the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa \n\nExperimental Station in Coimbra, MG, Brazil, to evaluate the pyramid lines: \n\none in the Autumn of 2007 (F4:6 progenies) and other one in the Winter/Spring \n\nof 2007 (F4:7 progenies).  In the first experiment the only trait evaluated was \n\ngrain production.  Besides this trait, reaction to rust and grain aspect were also \n\nevaluated in the second experiment.  Both experiments included 16 pyramid \n\nprogenies identified as homozygous for all rust resistance loci by the progeny \n\ntest based on molecular markers (Figure 2), 75 carioca-type progenies \n\nharboring one or two rust resistance genes derived from the backcross and \n\npyramid programs, and nine reference cultivars: \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019, \u2018Vi-4899\u2019, \n\n\u2018Majestoso\u2019, \u2018P\u00e9rola\u2019, \u2018Talism\u00e3\u2019, and \u2018VC-3\u2019 (carioca seeded beans high \n\nyielding and widely grown in Brazil); \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 and \u2018Mexico 309\u2019 (black \n\nseeded beans resistant to rust); and \u2018Vermelhinho\u2019 (red seeded bean \n\nsusceptible to rust). \n\nIn all experiments a randomized triple 10\u00d710 lattice design was used.  \n\nEach plot consisted of two rows each 2.0 m long, spaced by 0.5 m, with 15 \n\nseeds per meter.  The equivalent of 350 Kg/ha of the formula 8-28-16 (N, P2O5 \n\n\n\n \n\n 103\n\nand K2O, respectively) was used as fertilizer during sowing, and 150 Kg/ha \n\nammonium sulfate was applied 25 days after emergence.  Harvest of the whole \n\nplot was done manually.  The grain yield was determined for each plot and \n\nexpressed as g/2m2 (g/plot).  Reaction to rust was determined in the field using \n\nthe six-grade scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983).  The grain aspect was \n\nevaluated visually using a five-grade scale as reported by Marques-J\u00fanior et \n\nal. (1997).  In this scale grade 1 represents the wanted grain aspect (carioca-\n\ntype) and grade 5, the extreme opposite.  At least two separate researchers \n\nevaluated the reactions to rust and grain aspect.  The Tukey test was used to \n\nevaluate the significance of the differences among the mean values obtained \n\nfor each trait. \n\n \n\n3.  Results \n\n \n\n3.1.  Development of pyramid lines assisted by molecular markers \n\nBC3F1 plants derived from the separate backcross programs using \u2018Mexico \n\n309\u2019 (gene Ur-5) and \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019 (gene Ur-11) as donor parents were \n\ninoculated with a mixture of the U. appendiculatus races 29-3, 61-3, 63-3, and \n\n63-19.  The relative genetic similarities between the recurrent genitor \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \n\nand the resistant BC3F1 plants varied from 80.8 to 98.1% (\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Mexico \n\n309\u2019) and from 82.1 to 98.2% (\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019).  The total number \n\nof bands and the percentage of polymorphic DNA bands used to calculate \n\nthese genetic similarity values were 39 and 48.7%, and 39 and 41.0%, \n\nrespectively (Table 2). \n\nThe resistant BC3F1 plants which were genetically closest to \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \n\nwere conducted up to the BC3F2:3 generation (Figure 1).  The carioca seeded \n\nBC3F2:3 families homozygous for the rust resistance loci were identified by \n\ninoculation with the U. appendiculatus races 21-3 (\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Mexico 309\u2019) \n\nand 29-15 (\u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019).  The selected BC3F2:3 families were \n\ncrossed pairwise to start the pyramiding process.  The F1 plants obtained were \n\ncrossed with the carioca-type common bean line \u2018Vi-4899\u2019 (gene Ur-ON), \n\n\n\n \n\n 104\n\nderived from the cross \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 \u00d7 \u2018Ouro Negro\u2019 by molecular marker-assisted \n\nbackcrosses (Faleiro et al. 2004).  The triple-hybrid plants that presented the \n\nmarkers SI19 and OPX11 were selfed and 189 F2 seeds were obtained.  DNA \n\nobtained from the F2 plants was amplified with the molecular markers \n\nidentified as specifically linked to each one of the rust resistance genes (Table \n\n3), and eight F2 plants were selected.  These plants were selfed to obtain the \n\nnext generations.  For the selection of plants carrying all resistance genes to U. \n\nappendiculatus in subsequent generations, the presence of specific RAPD and \n\nSCAR markers (Table 3) was used as selection criterion (Figure 2).  Following \n\nthis methodology it was possible to obtain 16 F4:5 families phenotypic and \n\ngenotypically similar to the recurrent cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 and non-segregating for \n\nthe DNA markers associated to the rust resistance genes.   \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Agronomic performance evaluation \n\nThe 16 selected F4:5 pyramid families were multiplied in the field to obtain \n\nenough seeds for evaluation of agronomic traits.  The corresponding F4:6 \n\nfamilies and 75 carioca-type progenies harboring one or two rust resistance \n\ngenes derived from the backcross and pyramiding programs, in addition to \n\nnine reference cultivars, were tested for grain yield during the Autumn of \n\n2007.  The resulting 16 F4:7 pyramid lines and the other 84 treatments were \n\nalso evaluated for grain production, reaction to rust, and grain aspect during \n\nthe Winter/Spring of 2007.  The F-statistic (P &lt;0.01) indicated that there was \n\ngenetic variability for the three evaluated traits among the analyzed genetic \n\nmaterial (data not shown).  The mean values for grain production of the F4:7 \n\npyramid lines did not differ statistically in relation to \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 and to other high \n\nyielding carioca seeded reference cultivars widely grown in Brazil.

Discussion \n\n \n\nIn this work we report a gene pyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers \n\nto develop carioca-type common bean lines harboring simultaneously the rust \n\nresistance genes Ur-5 \u2013 from \u2018Mexico 309\u2019, Ur-11 \u2013 from \u2018BelMiDak RR-3\u2019, \n\nand Ur-ON \u2013 from \u2018Vi-4899\u2019, a carioca seeded line derived from \u2018Ouro \n\nNegro\u2019 (Faleiro et al. 2004).  Carioca seeded beans are the most consumed in \n\nBrazil.  The use of gene pyramiding as breeding strategy aimed to develop \n\nhigh yielding lines with wide and potentially durable resistance to the rust \n\npathogen, the fungus U. appendiculatus. \n\nThe concept of molecular marker-assisted breeding was successfully \n\nused in this work.  The use of two separate backcross programs assisted by \n\nRAPD fingerprinting allowed the individual introgression of the rust \n\nresistance genes Ur-5 and Ur-11 in cultivar \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 after only three backcross \n\ncycles.  In addition, molecular markers specifically linked to the three \n\nresistance genes were identified and/or validated during the breeding process \n\n(Figure 1; Tables 1 and 3).  These markers were effectively used to aid the \n\npyramiding process and the development of advanced lines harboring \n\nsimultaneously all resistance genes in homozygosis.  The efficiency of the \n\nmarkers was confirmed by inoculation with specific races of the rust pathogen \n\nat the end of the breeding process (Table 5).  Yield evaluations of the \n\nadvanced lines demonstrated that no grain yield penalty in relation to the \n\nrecurrent progenitor \u2018Rud\u00e1\u2019 was observed after the pyramiding process.  The \n\ncarioca seeded pyramid lines were also resistant under field conditions (Table \n\n4). \n\nThe rust resistance gene pyramid of the lines developed in this work is \n\nnow being transferred to modern carioca-type cultivars and to other bean types \n\nwhich are also consumed in Brazil, e.g., black and red seeded beans.  In \n\naddition, the pyramid lines will be further evaluated in different bean growing \n\nregions by a Brazilian Bean Assay Network for productivity and disease \n\nresistance.  If the superior agronomic performance of these lines is confirmed \n\n\n\n \n\n 110\n\nthey could be recommended as new cultivars.  New rust resistance sources are \n\nalso being tested and added to our breeding program to widen the basis of the \n\npresent resistance gene pyramid.  To be effective, the gene pyramiding \n\nstrategy must be a continuous effort (Ragagnin et al. 2009).  \n\n Although gene pyramiding is not fully accepted by the scientific \n\ncommunity as an efficient breeding strategy to develop wide and potentially \n\ndurable resistance to pathogens, there are experimental evidence \n\ndemonstrating that it confers more effective resistance than that conferred by \n\nthe sum of the resistance present in the parental lines (Yoshimura et al. 1995; \n\nHuang et al. 1997; Singh et al. 2001).  According to Schafer and Roelfs \n\n(1985), the probability that a pathogen will overcome a gene pyramid of more \n\nthan two genes is extremely low.  In order for this to happen, independent \n\nmutations in the pathogen genome must occur and they should be combined in \n\nthe same genetic background, or they could occur simultaneously or \n\nsequentially in the genome of a specific isolate of the pathogen.  Thrall and \n\nBurdon (2003) also report epidemiology data that support the use of gene \n\npyramiding as an effective strategy for disease control.  According to these \n\nauthors, there is an inverse correlation between pathogen fitness and the \n\nnumber of avirulence genes present in its genome.  By studying the \n\npathosystem Melampsora lini-Linum marginale in Australia, these authors \n\nobserved that natural pathogen populations which were able to infect a greater \n\nnumber of host populations were less aggressive than pathogen populations \n\nwhich were able to infect a lower number of host populations.  The authors \n\nconcluded that inactivation of several avirulence genes in the pathogen \n\ncompromises its adaptability.  In other words, it indicates that gene \n\npyramiding can potentially keep the disease below an economical damage \n\nlevel and also prevent its fast dissemination. \n\n\n\n \n\n 111\n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by grants from \u201cConselho Nacional de \n\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico \u2013 CNPq\u201d and \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nAmparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais \u2013 FAPEMIG\u201d (Brazilian \n\ngovernment).
