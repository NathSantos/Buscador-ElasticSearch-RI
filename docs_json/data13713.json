The researchers are concentrated on applying the numerical models to minimize the\ndifference between the physical reality and the implemented numerical model by considering\nthe minimum computational cost. This work consists of the study of line-elements (such as\nline-doublets, circles, polygons, fractures) using the Analytic Element Method (AEM) for\ngroundwater flow. In this work, we consider the study of two-dimensional groundwater flow in\nfractured porous media by the Analytic Element Method. We develop a numerical solution based\non a series expansion for a problem with more than one fracture. Each fracture has an influence\nthat can be expanded in a series that satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation exactly. In the series expansion,\nthe unknown coefficients are obtained from the discharge potentials of all other elements that are\nrelated to the expansion coefficients. Sizes, locations and conductivities for all inhomogeneities\nare selected arbitrarily. This work also discusses a matrix method obtained by imposing the\nintern boundary conditions for the Analytic Element Method. The convergence analysis of a\nGauss-Seidel type iterative method is also discussed.\n\nKeywords: Analytic Element Method, Fractures, Groundwater Flow, Matrix Method, Numerical\nSimulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n\nHUSSAIN, S.

Os pesquisadores est\u00e3o concentrados na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos num\u00e9-\nricos para minimizar a diferen\u00e7a entre a realidade f\u00edsica e o modelo num\u00e9rico implementado\nconsiderando o custo computacional m\u00ednimo. Este trabalho consiste no estudo de elementos de\nlinha (como line-doublets, c\u00edrculos, pol\u00edgonos, fraturas) usando o M\u00e9todo de Elemento Anal\u00edtico\n(AEM) para o fluxo de \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas. Neste trabalho, consideramos o estudo do fluxo\nbidimensional de \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas em meios porosos fraturados pelo M\u00e9todo dos Elementos\nAnal\u00edticos. Desenvolvemos uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica baseada em uma expans\u00e3o em s\u00e9rie para um\nproblema com mais de uma fratura. Cada fratura tem uma influ\u00eancia que pode ser expandida em\numa s\u00e9rie que satisfa\u00e7a exatamente a equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Laplace. Na expans\u00e3o da s\u00e9rie, os coeficientes\ndesconhecidos s\u00e3o obtidos a partir dos potenciais de descarga de todos os outros elementos\nque est\u00e3o relacionados aos coeficientes de expans\u00e3o.

L. Strack in 1989, it is\na numerical method used for the solution of partial differential equations modelling groundwater\nproblems. The method is based on the principle of superposition. It uses the exact solution\nof the governing equations for basic fundamental features of the aquifer, such as a well, a\nriver, an impermeable barrier, a sink, called Analytic Elements, and combines such solutions by\nsuperposition to approximate the solution of a much more complex real problem. The solutions\nto the governing equation obtained by AEM will be exact, but the boundary conditions will be\nsatisfied only approximately. It does not require the specific domain to be discretized giving rise\nto a grid, only the boundary conditions at infinity and the internal conditions at certain points are\nrequired (MARIN, 2011).\n\nProblems in groundwater flow have been an area of active research for the past few\ndecades. Researchers working in these areas strived along the years for developing different\nnumerical methods using the governing equations of the physical phenomena (MARIN, 2011;\nSTRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA, 1995). To model groundwater systems, mathematical representa-\ntions are used. Modelling plays an important role, and is the most effective method to make such\nestimations involving complexities and uncertainties which model the behaviour of the aquifer.\nNumerical modelling is a practical tool for understanding complex phenomena and obtaining\ninformation. The implementation of the numerical models is usually made on a computer, that\ncan lead to errors, such as truncation and approximation. In recent years, researchers concen-\ntrated on developing numerical models with low computational cost for the required problems\nminimizing the difference between the physical reality and the implemented numerical model\n(MARIN, 2011). However, one of the major difficulties to be overcome in flow of groundwater\nis the problem of fractures, that has received much attention.\n\nThe problem of fractured media is complex, and difficult to obtain experimental data\n(MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989). Usual groundwater simulation codes use finite element and\nfinite difference methods, which though capable of simulating fracture flow phenomena, suffers\n\n\n\n30 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nfrom drawbacks such as difficulties with scale differences, dependence on domain discretization,\nmesh generation and solution approximations (WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002). We\nshall introduce the Analytic Element Method which is more suitable for solving the problems of\nlarge aquifers due to computational costs.\n\nThe main objective of this work is to study AEM for an array of fractures and other\nelements like line-doublets, circular inhomogeneities. The numerical solution is based on series\nexpansion for the solution that satisfy the governing equation exactly. The principle of superposi-\ntion is then used to linearly combine the solutions with unknown coefficients. These coefficients\nare then found by solving a linear system. The study of efficient numerical methods for solving\nthe linear system and the convergence analysis of a Gauss-Seidel type iterative method are the\nmain contributions of this work.\n\nThis work is organized as follows: Chapter 2 consists of some basic concepts for obtaining\nthe governing equations. Chapter 3 consists of the methodology for solving the problems that\nis based on the Analytic Element Method. Chapter 4 consists of the problems of circular\ninhomogeneities. Chapter 5 consists of the problems of fractures. Chapter 6 consists of the\nproblems of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-elements called line-doublets and their\ncomparison with the exact solutions of a circular inhomogeneity and a fracture. Chapter 7\nconsists of solution algorithm. Chapter 8 consists of results and its discussion. Chapter 9 consists\nof conclusion and Chapter 10 consists of future work.\n\n\n\n31\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\nBASIC EQUATIONS\n\nThis chapter presents some basic equations of groundwater flow based on (STRACK,\n1989).\n\nSpecific discharge: The volume of water flowing through a unit area of soil per unit time is\ncalled the specific discharge or discharge, represented by q and is given by:\n\nq =\nQ\nA\n, (2.1)\n\nwith unit of [q] =\n[Q]\n[A]\n\n=\nm3/s\nm2\n\n= m/s, where Q denotes the total volume of water per second and\n\nA denotes the cross-sectional area.\n\nVelocity: The average velocity at a certain point of a porous medium is known as seepage\nvelocity or velocity. It is obtained through the division of the specific discharge by the fraction\nof voids present in a unit area of the porous medium. The unit of velocity is also [m/s] and is\nrepresented by v , that is:\n\nv =\nq\nn\n, (2.2)\n\nwhere n shows the porosity of the medium, which is a constant.\n\nFor understanding the concept of specific discharge and seepage velocity, consider the\nwater flowing through a horizontal cylindrical tube which is filled with water and sand and is\nplaced in the space between the ends with caps 1 and 2 (represented by dotted lines in Figure 1).\nThe cylinder is also connected with two reservoirs I and II having different water levels. The\nwater will flow through the cylinder because of the difference in water levels. To maintain its\nlevel, the water must be poured into reservoir I and the level of reservoir II is controlled by the\noverflow. To measure the rate at which the water is poured into reservoir I, first we need to know\nthe total amount of water Q flowing through the cylinder per unit time. The specific discharge\n\n\n\n32 Chapter 2. Basic Equations\n\nof water is obtained through the division of Q by the cross-sectional area of the cylinder A\n(STRACK, 1989).\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic of Darcy\u2019s experiment\n\nSource: Strack (2014).\n\nUsing eq. (2.1), the seepage velocity becomes:\n\nv =\nq\nn\n=\n\nQ\nnA\n\n. (2.3)\n\nThe seepage velocity is also used to find the average time t for a water particle to travel through\nthe sample. If L is the length of the sample, then the time t is obtained using the following\nrelation (STRACK, 1989):\n\nvt = L (2.4)\n\nor\n\nt =\nL\nv\n=\n\nLnA\nQ\n\n. (2.5)\n\nPressure: From the weight of the water column above a point P in a standpipe, we can find the\npressure of water at point P , whose unit is [N/m2] and is given by:\n\np = ? g(? ? Z). (2.6)\n\nConsider that the elevation of P above the reference level is Z, then the height of the water\ncolumn above P is ? ? Z, where, the density of water is denoted by ? [kg/m3] and acceleration\nof gravity is denoted by g[m/s2] .\n\nHead: At a certain point P in a soil body, the hydraulic head is defined as the level to which the\nwater rises in an open standpipe as shown in Figure 2. The unit of head is [m] and is denoted by\n? , which is given by:\n\n? =\np\n\n? g\n+ Z. (2.7)\n\nTherefore the head equals to the sum of the pressure head p/? g whose unit is (N/m2)/(N/m3) or\n[m] and the elevation head Z.\n\n\n\n2.1. Darcy\u2019s Law 33\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Definition of the head ?\n\nSource: Strack (2014).\n\n2.1 Darcy\u2019s Law\n\nIn 1856, the French engineer Darcy conducted an experiment from which he determined\nan empirical relation for the specific discharge in terms of the heads. The original form of this\nlaw is only applicable to rectilinear flow of a homogeneous liquid (STRACK, 1989).\n\n2.1.1 Rectilinear Flow\n\nDarcy\u2019s experiment consisted of a cylinder of sand having cross-sectional area A with\ntwo ends having cap 1 with head ?1 and cap 2 with head ?2. From the experiment he concluded\nthat the amount of flow through a cylinder of sand increases linearly with the difference in head\nat the ends of the sample as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Darcy\u2019s experiment\n\nSource: Strack (2014).\n\nFrom this picture it can be seen that the pipe connecting reservoir I to the sample can be\nviewed as a standpipe. Using information from Figure 3, Darcy\u2019s law is given by the following\n\n\n\n34 Chapter 2. Basic Equations\n\nequation as presented in (STRACK, 1989; BEAR, 2013).\n\nQ = KA\n(\n\n?1 ? ?2\nL\n\n)\n, (2.8)\n\nwhere K is a constant known as the hydraulic conductivity. The dimensions of K are those of\nvelocity [m/s], Q is the discharge [m3/s], A is the cross-sectional area of the sample [m2] and L\nis the length of the sample [m].\n\nIn terms of the specific discharge q using eq. (2.1), eq. (2.8) becomes:\n\nq = K\n(\n\n?1 ? ?2\nL\n\n)\n. (2.9)\n\nBy measuring the head at various points inside the sample along the x-axis, it appears to\nvary linearly over the sample and becomes:\n\nd?\ndx\n\n=\n?2 ? ?1\n\nL\n. (2.10)\n\nHence, eq. (2.9) may be expressed as:\n\nqx = ?K\nd?\ndx\n\n, (2.11)\n\nwhich gives the specific discharge in the x-direction.\nd?\ndx\n\nis known as the hydraulic gradient for\nflow in the x-direction, as presented in (STRACK, 1989).\n\n2.1.2 General form of Darcy\u2019s Law\n\nIn practical problems, the flow is rarely rectilinear and neither the direction of flow nor\nthe magnitude of the hydraulic gradient is known. Therefore, the simple form of Darcy\u2019s law\ndefined by eq. (2.11) is not suitable for solving problems. In order to solve practical problems, it\nis necessary to use a generalized form of Darcy\u2019s law which gives a relation between the specific\ndischarge vector and the hydraulic gradient. The direction of the specific discharge vector will\nvary with position and is in the direction of flow. The magnitude of this vector represents the\namount of water flowing per unit time through a plane of unit area normal to the direction of\nflow, as described in (STRACK, 2014). In three dimensions, the specific discharge vector has\nthree components with reference to a Cartesian coordinate system x, y, z. For three-dimensional\nflow using eq. (2.11), the general form of Darcy\u2019s law in terms of specific discharge becomes:\n\nqx = ?K\n? ?\n\n? x\n, qy = ?K\n\n? ?\n\n? y\nand qz = ?K\n\n? ?\n\n? z\n. (2.12)\n\nThis is because the components of the specific discharge vector are proportional to the compo-\nnents of the hydraulic gradient, with K as the proportionality constant. The specific discharge\nvector with components (qx, qy, qz) is represented briefly as qi, where the index i stands for x, y\n\n\n\n2.2. Continuity of Flow 35\n\nor z. The partial derivatives\n? ?\n\n? x\n,\n\n? ?\n\n? y\nand\n\n? ?\n\n? z\nrepresent the three components of the hydraulic\n\ngradient. We may write the components of this vector as ?x? , ?y? and ?z? , where the ? stands for\ndifferentiation with respect to the coordinate system (STRACK, 1989). The hydraulic gradient\ncan then be written as:\n\n[?i?] =\n\n[\n? ?\n\n? x\n,\n? ?\n\n? y\n,\n? ?\n\n? z\n\n]\n. (2.13)\n\nFinally, using eq. (2.12) and eq. (2.13), the general form of Darcy\u2019s law is:\n\nqi = ?K?i?, i = 1,2,3. (2.14)\n\n2.2 Continuity of Flow\n\nDarcy\u2019s law consists of three equations of motion having four unknowns qx , qy , qz and\n? . For a complete description of groundwater flow an additional fourth equation is required,\nknown as the mass balance equation. The mass balance equation is valid for steady flow, where it\nreduces to the equation of continuity. It results from the consideration that no water can be stored\nor produced in an elementary block of soil filled with water as shown in Figure 4. According to\n(STRACK, 1989), continuity of the flow is considered by the use of the concept of divergence.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Continuity of flow\n\nSource: Strack (2014).\n\n2.2.1 Divergence\n\nThe divergence of the specific discharge vector is defined as the net outflow per unit area\nand per unit time at a point in the porous medium. The concept of divergence is not limited to\n\n\n\n36 Chapter 2. Basic Equations\n\nthe specific discharge function, for example we could apply this concept to the velocity field of\nany substance, and it is useful in such considerations as mass balance.\n\nAs described in (STRACK, 1989; STRACK, 2014) the divergence of the specific dis-\ncharge vector for the block shown in Figure 4 is determined. Consider that the sides of the block\nare ?x, ?y and ?z, and the center is at (x,y,z). The cube is so small that the variation of the\nmagnitudes of the components of qi along the sides can be neglected with respect to their value\nat the center of each side. The inflow through each side then is equal to the normal component of\nqi multiplied by the area of the side. The net flow ?Q[m3 /s] leaving the block is obtained from\nFigure 4, where only the components of qi normal to the sides are drawn:\n\n?Q = ?y?z[qx(x +\n?x\n2\n,y,z)? qx(x ?\n\n?x\n2\n,y,z)]\n\n+?x?z[qy(x,y +\n?y\n2\n,z)? qy(x,y ?\n\n?y\n2\n,z)]\n\n+?x?y[qz(x,y,z +\n?z\n2\n)? qz(x,y,z ?\n\n?z\n2\n)].\n\n(2.15)\n\nNow dividing through by ?x?y?z, we have:\n\nqx(x +\n?x\n2\n,y,z)? qx(x ?\n\n?x\n2\n,y,z)\n\n?x\n\n+\nqy(x,y +\n\n?y\n2\n,z)? qy(x,y ?\n\n?y\n2\n,z)\n\n?y\n\n+\nqz(x,y,z +\n\n?z\n2\n)? qz(x,y,z ?\n\n?z\n2\n)\n\n?z\n= div(??q ),\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere div(??q ) represents the divergence of the specific discharge vector. Taking the limit, as\n?x ? 0,?y ? 0,?z ? 0, then in terms of partial derivatives eq. (2.16) becomes:\n\n? qx\n? x\n\n+\n? qy\n? y\n\n+\n? qz\n? z\n\n= div(??q ), (2.17)\n\nwhich is the expression for the divergence of the specific discharge vector.\n\nThe divergence of the discharge vector is zero for the case of steady flow, but also for the\nspecial case of transient flow where both the fluid and the porous medium are incompressible.\nTherefore eq. (2.17) becomes:\n\n? qx\n? x\n\n+\n? qy\n? y\n\n+\n? qz\n? z\n\n= 0, (2.18)\n\nwhich is the continuity equation for steady groundwater flow. The divergence of the specific\ndischarge vector is non-zero only if the flow is transient, and if either the porous medium or the\nfluid is compressible.\n\nThe combined form of Darcy\u2019s law and the continuity equation give four equations for\nthe following four unknowns qx, qy, qz and ? . By substituting values of qx, qy and qz in eq. (2.18),\n\n\n\n2.3. Basic Equations of Groundwater flow 37\n\nit becomes:\n?\n\n? x\n\n[\nK\n\n? ?\n\n? x\n\n]\n+\n\n?\n\n? y\n\n[\nK\n\n? ?\n\n? y\n\n]\n+\n\n?\n\n? z\n\n[\nK\n\n? ?\n\n? z\n\n]\n= 0, (2.19)\n\nwhich shows the governing equation for steady groundwater flow. Finally, after simplification\nassuming K is constant, we get:\n\n?\n2\n?\n\n? x2\n+\n\n?\n2\n?\n\n? y2\n+\n\n?\n2\n?\n\n? z2\n= 0, (2.20)\n\nwhich is Laplace\u2019s equation for the head in the three dimensional case.\n\n2.3 Basic Equations of Groundwater flow\n\nIn (STRACK, 1989), it is argued that for obtaining the basic equation of groundwater\nflow, we need to introduce the discharge vector Qi to discuss about the discharge potential instead\nof the specific discharge. The discharge flowing through the aquifer per unit length is found by\nmultiplying the specific discharge by the thickness of the aquifer, H, and is defined as Qi = Hqi.\nConsider a discharge vector with two components Qx and Qy for two-dimensional flow, defined\nas:\n\nQx = Hqx and Qy = Hqy. (2.21)\n\nUsing eq. (2.11), eq. (2.21) takes the form:\n\nQx = Hqx = H\n(\n?K\n\n? ?\n\n? x\n\n)\n\nQy = Hqy = H\n(\n?K\n\n? ?\n\n? y\n\n) , (2.22)\n\nwhere K is the hydraulic conductivity constant. Since K and H are constants, eq. (2.22) may be\nrewritten as:\n\nQx = ?\n? (KH?)\n\n? x\n\nQy = ?\n? (KH?)\n\n? y\n\n. (2.23)\n\nIt is convenient to introduce a new variable ? (the discharge potential). The discharge potential\n? is is the real part of the complex potential and is valid for both confined and unconfined\nflows whose applications deal with the flow in shallow aquifers, where the Dupit-Forchheimer\nassumption1 may be adopted. For confined aquifer with thickness H as shown in Figure 5 and\nhydraulic conductivity K, the discharge potential is given by:\n\n? = KH? +Cc (? > H), (2.24)\n1 According to Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption, the variation of the head ? in the vertical direction can\n\nbe neglected as presented in different works (STRACK, 2014; STRACK, 2003; JONG, 1960).\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 2. Basic Equations\n\nand for the unconfined aquifer the discharge potential is given by:\n\n? =\n1\n2\n\nK? 2 +Cu (? &lt;H), (2.25)\n\nwhere Cc and Cu are arbitrary constants.\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 One-dimensional combined confined/unconfined flow\n\nSource: Marin (2011).\n\nSince\n?Cc\n? x\n\n=\n?Cc\n? y\n\n= 0, using eq. (2.23) with eq. (2.24), we get:\n\nQx = ?\n?\n\n? x\n[KH? +Cc] = ?\n\n? ?\n\n? x\n\nQy = ?\n?\n\n? y\n[KH? +Cc] = ?\n\n? ?\n\n? y\n\n. (2.26)\n\nTherefore, the governing equation in terms of discharge potential for two-dimensional flow\nbecomes:\n\n?\n2\n?\n\n? x2\n+\n\n?\n2\n?\n\n? y2\n= 0, (2.27)\n\nwhich is Laplace\u2019s equation in terms of discharge potential.\n\n\n\n39\n\nCHAPTER\n\n3\nANALYTIC ELEMENT METHOD\n\nThis chapter describes a brief description of the Analytic Element Method, which is\nbased on (STRACK, 1989; MARIN, 2011).\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe Analytic Element Method (AEM) was presented by Otto D.L. Strack to simulate\ngroundwater flow. It uses the exact solution of the governing equations for basic fundamental\nfeatures of the aquifer, such as a well, a river, an impermeable barrier, a sink, called Analytic\nElements, and combines such solutions by superposition to approximate the solution of a much\nmore complex real problem. The AEM is based on analytic solutions of the groundwater gov-\nerning equations and does not depend on domain discretization, being able to tackle multiscale\nproblems where other methods have difficulties (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989). This method\nhas been applied in different fields such as wellhead protection area delineation, nuclear waste\nrepositories, and vertical stratified aquifers (MARIN, 2011; WONG; CRAIG, 2010). In this\nmethod, each analytic solution represents an hydrogeologic feature. The hydrogeologic feature is\ndiscretized into simpler geometric features, like points, line segments or polygons. Each geomet-\nric feature is represented by an analytic function with unknown coefficients. The free coefficients\non these functions must be calculated to satisfy the boundary conditions imposed. In one of the\nsolution approaches, the coefficients are found by specifying the boundary conditions for the\ncoordinate points on the elements, using the collocation method. There are several approaches\nto improve the numerical accuracy or decrease the computational time required to solve the\nresulting system of equations (BAKKER, 2008; BAKKER et al., 1999; BAKKER; KELSON,\n2009; BANDILLA; RABIDEAU; JANKOVIC?, 2009; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b). In recent\nyears, AEM received attention with its use for harmonically heterogeneous aquifers (CRAIG,\n2009), and the use of Wirtinger calculus (STRACK, 2009a; STRACK, 2009b). Recently, Strack\n(STRACK, 2014) used the Cauchy Integral formula combined with the Joukowsky transform\n\n\n\n40 Chapter 3. Analytic Element Method\n\nto satisfy the boundary conditions for circular inhomogeneities and line-doublets. Readers are\nencouraged to read (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999) for an introductory level discussion of the\nAEM.\n\nConsider a system which consists of some wells, rivers, circular and polygonal inhomo-\ngeneities and fractures. By studying their groundwater flows, we will observe that influences\nwould occur due to the rivers, circular and polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. In order\nto solve such problems, Strack in (STRACK, 1989) proposed line-elements (such as line-sinks,\nline-dipoles and line-doublets), which will discuss in Chapter 6 in detail. Strack and Haitjema\nused line-sinks for modelling creeks and rivers in a regional flow model, whereas the wells are\nused as the places where the inflow or outflow occurs and line-doublets for fractures as described\nin (STRACK, 1982; STRACK, 1989).\n\nIn the following work we shall introduce the solution for basic Analytic Elements such as\nline-doublet, circle and fracture. Such elements will be used later to simulate internal boundary\ncondition and inhomogeneous medium. We recall that each of those solution satisfies Laplace\u2019s\nequation with special boundary condition that are akin to the problem at hand.\n\nThe complex potential in the AEM may be written by using the superposition principle\nwhich is the sum of many complex potential components for each physical feature enclosed in a\nmodel. The complex potential, ?(z), at point z = x + iy in the complex plane has the form:\n\n?(z) = ?(z)+ i?(z), (3.1)\n\nwhere ?(z) is the real part of the complex potential, called discharge potential, proportional to\nthe hydraulic head and ?(z) is the associated stream function. The gradient of the discharge\npotential is orthogonal to the gradient of the stream function and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann\nequations:\n\n? ?\n\n? z\n= i\n\n? ?\n\n? z\n. (3.2)\n\nLines of constant discharge potential are defined as equipotentials and lines of constant values\nof the stream function are defined as streamlines. Similarly flow nets are created by plotting\ncontours of ? = constant and ? = constant and choosing ?? = ??. This can be seen from eq.\n(3.2).\n\nIn order to work with the AEM, first of all the discharge potential ?0 at the reference\npoint z0 is to be calculated using an aquifer condition (like confined or unconfined aquifer). After\ncalculating ?0, this discharge potential may be used to calculate the constant C for solving the\nproblem, that takes the form:\n\nC = ?0 ? ?\n(\n?T (zre f )\n\n)\n, (3.3)\n\nwhere ?T is the complex potential of all the elements at refrence point z0.\n\n\n\n3.2. Methods for satisfying the Boundary Conditions 41\n\n3.2 Methods for satisfying the Boundary Conditions\nThe solution of the governing equation for each element (line-doublet, circle, fracture\n\netc.) have degrees of freedom which satisfy the boundary conditions, according to the type\nof the element and the problem. One of the central fact about AEM is to understand how the\nboundary conditions are met for each problem. For this purpose, the following two methods:\nCollocation Method and Overspecification Method are widely used in the literature as described\nin (HAITJEMA, 1995; MARIN, 2011; JANKOVIC?, 1997; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b;\nBARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; PRESS, 2007). The first was the collocation method. It uses\npredefined points on the element called collocation points, where the boundary conditions are\nenforced exactly. The second one is Overspecification method, where the number of unknown\ncoefficients representing a number of control points over the element is higher than the number\nof degrees of freedom for each element, and the boundary conditions are satisfied in a least\nsquare sense over the control points (see further detail in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a)).\n\n3.3 Coordinates Transformation\nWe will discuss two-dimensional problems with complex variables, in this work. There-\n\nfore, the functional relationship of the complex variable z and the variables x and y is given by\n(MARIN, 2011):\n\nf (z) = f (x,y). (3.4)\n\nThe use of Laplace\u2019s equation for complex variables open the possibility of the use of\nWritinger calculus. It is based on a transformation of variables and allows the direct integration\nof the Laplace equation in coordinate system, as described in (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 2009a;\nSTRACK, 2009b). This transformation is an interesting feature of working with complex vari-\nables and plays an important role in the development of the AEM. It is actually the transformation\nof a line in z-plane having length L with directional angle ? relative to the x-axis. Consider the\nglobal coordinate system with point z, defined by:\n\nz = x + iy, (3.5)\n\nand the local coordinate system with point Z , defined by:\n\nZ = X + iY. (3.6)\n\nLet z1 and z2 be the two points in the z-plane. Then the transformation\n\nZ =\nz ?\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2)\n\n1\n2\n(z2 ? z1)\n\n(3.7)\n\n\n\n42 Chapter 3. Analytic Element Method\n\nmaps the line [z1 , z2] into the interval [-1,1], and the inverse transformation is given by:\n\nz = Z\n1\n2\n(z2 ? z1)+\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2), (3.8)\n\nwhere z1 and z2 represent the initial and end points of the line respectively. This transformation\nis shown in Figure 6 and will be used in this work.\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 The transformation from the global coordinate system z to the local one Z\n\nSource: Marin (2011).\n\n\n\n43\n\nCHAPTER\n\n4\nCIRCULAR INHOMOGENEITIES\n\nThis chapter discusses the problem of circular inhomogeneities and a methodology\nfor solving it. The proposed methodology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM)\npresented in chapter 3 and more extensively at (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989; JANKOVIC?;\nBARNES, 1999a; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999).\n\n4.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter we will deal with the problem of an aquifer compose of circular regions\n\nwhose hydraulic conductivity is different from the surrounding medium. See the Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Aquifer with circular inhomogeneities of distinct hydraulic conductivities\n\nCircular inhomogeneities are circular regions with different hydraulic conductivities. Let\nK+j be the hydraulic conductivity inside and K be the hydraulic conductivity outside the circle j,\nwhich shows the permeability of the material. It depends upon the properties of the material like\nfluid and soil. It is a material constant and is different in range for different materials like soil,\nsand, clay, gravels etc. presented in (STRACK, 1989). The influence of circular inhomogeneities\nare simulated by expanding the complex potential in Laurent series outside and Taylor series\n\n\n\n44 Chapter 4. Circular Inhomogeneities\n\ninside the inhomogeneity as presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; STRACK, 1999).\nConsider the complex potential ?(z) in the form:\n\n?(z) = ?(z)+ i?(z), (4.1)\n\nwhere ?(z) is the real part of the complex potential, called discharge potential, and is proportional\nto the hydraulic head, ?(z) is the imaginary part of the complex potential, called the stream\nfunction and z = x + iy is the location of a point in the complex plane.\n\nThe complex potential for a circular inhomogeneity j having radius R j and center c j has\nbeen presented in different works (JANKOVIC?, 1997; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN,\n2011), and is defined as:\n\n? j(Z) = ? j(Z)+ i? j(Z) =\n\n???\n??\n\na0 +\n?\n\n?\nn=1\n\nanZnj |Z| &lt;1\n\n?\n?\n\n?\nn=1\n\nanZ\n?n\nj |Z| > 1\n\n, (4.2)\n\nfor which\nZ =\n\nz ? c j\nR j\n\n, (4.3)\n\nwhere the coefficient a0 is real and all an are complex, z represents any position in the global\ncoordinate system and Z = X +iY is the local coordinate system which represents similar position\nspecified in local coordinates. The boundary of the circular inhomogeneity is given by:\n\n|z ? c j| = R j, (4.4)\n\nwhich may be written using the local coordinate system as (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999):\n\nZ = ei? , 0 6 ? &lt;2?. (4.5)\n\nAccording to (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN, 2011), it is assumed that the\ncircular inhomogeneity does not meet with other elements and the stream function ? j(Z) given\nby eq. (4.2) is continuous across the boundary due to ?(anein? ) = ??(ane?in? ). Therefore, the\ncomplex potential of all the elements in the domain can be represented as:\n\n?(Z) = ? j(Z)+ ??= j(Z), (4.6)\n\nwhere ??= j(Z) is the combined complex potential of all circular inhomogeneities except j. The\ncontinuity of ? ?= j(Z) and eq. (4.2) ensure the continuity of the stream function across the\nboundary of the circular inhomogeneity. Therefore, it is sufficient for the continuity of flow\neverywhere in the given domain.\n\n4.2 Boundary Conditions\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions, the head must be continuous at the edge of an\n\ninhomogeneity (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999), that is:\n\n?\n+(? ) = ? ?(? ). (4.7)\n\n\n\n4.3. Determining the Unknown Coefficients 45\n\nThe only component that jumps across the boundary of the circular inhomogeneity is the\ncomponent of the discharge potential itself, which is the contribution from all the circular\ninhomogeneities (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999). Hence, the continuity condition of the head at\nthe edge of an inhomogeneity can be written as:\n\n?\n+\n\nK+j\n=\n\n?\n?\n\nK\n, (4.8)\n\nwhere the + sign is the internal part and the ? sign is the external part of the inhomogeneity,\nwhereas, K+j is the hydraulic conductivity inside and K is the hydraulic conductivity outside the\ncircle j. Due to the continuity of the head, the boundary can be parametrized by the angle ? , i.e.,\n0 6 ? 6 2? , that leads to the relation (MARIN, 2011; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999):\n\n?\n+(? )\n\nK+j\n=\n\n?\n?(? )\n\nK\n. (4.9)\n\nBy combining the discharge potentials of all the components of circular inhomogeneities, we\nget:\n\n?\n+\n?= j(? )+ ?\n\n+\nj (? )\n\nK+j\n=\n\n?\n?\n?= j(? )+ ?\n\n?\nj (? )\n\nK\n, (4.10)\n\nor\n\nK?+j (? )? K\n+\nj ?\n\n?\nj (? ) = (K\n\n+\nj ? K)?\n\n?\n?= j(? ) = (K\n\n+\nj ? K)? ?= j(? ), (4.11)\n\nwhere ?+j (? ) is the discharge potential inside the circle j, ?\n?\nj (? ) is the discharge potential\n\noutside the circle j and ?+?= j(? ) is the discharge potentail inside of all circular inhomogeneities,\nwhereas ???= j(? ) is the discharge potentail outside of all circular inhomogeneities except j.\n\nSince the discharge potential generated by the other elements is continuous over the edge\nof the jth circular inhomogeneity. Therefore, the boundary conditions may be written as:\n\nK?+j (? )? K\n+\nj ?\n\n?\nj (? ) = (K\n\n+\nj ? K)??= j(? ), (4.12)\n\nwhich is used to determine expressions for calculating the unknown coefficients.\n\n4.3 Determining the Unknown Coefficients\n\nThe following techniques are used to determine the required expressions for calculating\nthe unknown coefficients.\n\n4.3.1 Orthogonality of Fourier Series\n\nTo calculate the unknown coefficients of potential expansion for an analytical element,\nthe boundary condition eq. (4.7) for a circular inhomogeneity may be used. It may be calculated\nusing eq. (4.2) by the use of Fourier orthogonal relationship. Substituting the real part of eq.\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 4. Circular Inhomogeneities\n\n(4.2) in eq. (4.12), multiplying both sides by e?im? , and integrating from 0 to 2? (MARIN, 2011;\nBARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999), we get:\n\na0 =\n\n(\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n\n)\n1\n\n2?\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n??= j(? )d? (4.13)\n\nand\n\nan =\n\n(\nK+j ? K\nK + K+j\n\n)\n1\n?\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? ?= j(? )e\n?in? d? , (4.14)\n\nwhere a0 is real and all an are complex. The proof is presented in Appendix A.\n\nUsing eq. (4.2) into eq. (4.14) we get an infinite linear system for the unknowns a0,a1,....\nObviously, in practice the infinite series must be truncated and only a finite number of coefficients\nhave to be found.\n\n4.3.2 Least Square Approach\n\nThe unknown coefficients given by eq. (4.13) and eq. (4.14) are exact, and determined\nby the use of Fourier orthogonal series. Here is another approach called least square approach, in\nwhich the unknown coefficients can be determined by minimization techniques. Regarding this\napproach we have:\n\na0 =\n\n(\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n\n)\n1\n\nM j\n\nM j?1\n\n?\nm=0\n\n? ?= j(?m) (4.15)\n\nand\n\nan =\n\n(\nK+j ? K\nK + K+j\n\n)\n2\n\nM j\n\nM j?1\n\n?\nm=0\n\n? ?= j(?m)e\n?in?m, (4.16)\n\nwhere M j shows control points on the boundary of the circular inhomogeneity j. This is the\ndiscrete form of eq. (4.13) and eq. (4.14) and its proof is presented in Appendix A.\n\n4.4 Exact Solution for One Circular Inhomogeneity\n\nA circular/cylindrical inhomogeneity in an uniform field with certain hydraulic conduc-\ntivity will serve to issustrate the behavior of the complex potential along the boundary of an\ninhomogeneity. The complex potentials in the domain for an inhomogeneity inside and outside\nthe boundary is denoted by ?+ and ?? as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n4.5. The Uniform Flow 47\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 A circular/cylindrical inhomogeneity\n\nSource: Strack (1989).\n\nThe exact solution of the problem of a circular inhomogeneity having radius R, centred\nat origin in an uniform flow field can be determined by the formulation presented in (STRACK,\n2014; MARIN, 2011):\n\n?\n+(Z) = ?Qx0 z\n\n2K+j\nK + K+j\n\n+\nK+j\nK\n\n?0 for zz &lt;R\n2 (4.17)\n\nand\n\n?\n?(Z) = ?Qx0\n\n(\nz ?\n\nK+j ? K\nK + K+j\n\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\n+ ?0 for zz > R\n\n2, (4.18)\n\nwhere Qx0 is the uniform flow field intensity that is parallel to the x-axis and ?0 is a reference\npoint with a known head. The proof is presented in Appendix B.\n\n4.5 The Uniform Flow\n\nThe uniform flow show the behavior of the streamlines in the domain. The definition of\nthe uniform flow for the global coordinate system having intensity Qu f , forming an angle ?u f\nrelative to the x-axis, described in (STRACK, 1989), shown in Figure 9 is given by:\n\n?u f = ?Qu f ze?i?u f +C, (4.19)\n\nwhere C is called the reference point constant and must be calculated given the hydraulic head at\na reference point.

Along the negative x-axis, we\n\nobtain ? =\nQw\n2\n\nif we choose ? = ? , whereas ? = ?\nQw\n2\n\nif we choose ? = ?? . This connects\nthe well to infinity, called branch cut.\n\nAccording to (STRACK, 2014), we can imagine that the water that flows from infinity to\nthe well is transferred via the branch cut back to infinity, thereby satisfying the condition that\nthere always must be continuity of flow. The jump in the stream function is indeed compatible\nwith flow from the well through the branch cut to infinity. It is noted that this is a mathematical\nobservation that has nothing to do with reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\nCHAPTER\n\n5\nFRACTURES\n\nThis chapter deals with the problems of fractures in an uniform flow field and methodol-\nogy for solving it. The proposed methodology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM)\ndescribed in (STRACK, 1982; MARIN, 2011).\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nSimulation of groundwater flow in fractured porous media is a relevant problem in\ndifferent fields such as geologic repositories for nuclear wastes and groundwater contamination\n(BERKOWITZ, 2002; NEUMAN, 2005). Groundwater flow in fractures is fundamental in this\ncontext. It is usually present in almost all geologic formations, and can propagate groundwater\n(and solutes) several orders of magnitude faster than the porous media, being a contamination\nvector (BERKOWITZ, 2002). Geometry of a fracture is a key factor in the process occurring\nin it. One of the basic principle is that the fracture would have an ellipsoid shape with no flow\nat the ends. Fractures are usually thin and saturated with water. The walls of the fractures are\nsymmetric with respect to the planes through the centres of the fractures. The most common\nconceptual model is that the fracture is formed by smooth and flat parallel plates, as considered\nfor various experiments in different woks (MARIN, 2011; BERKOWITZ, 2002; BEAR; TSANG;\nMARSILY, 2012; WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002). In general, there are two common\nclasses to model flow in fracture networks:\n\n5.1.1 Continuous Models\n\nContinuous models consists of two or more continuous interacting fractures. It is applied\nwhen a continuous network of fractures is highly connected and dense, whereas, the porous\nmedium can be ignored. In most cases it is complicated to assume a continuous model for\nfractured system (fractals), due to the directional dependence in the flow and the influence of\n\n\n\n52 Chapter 5. Fractures\n\ndifferent scales for the properties of fractures for the transport see (MARIN, 2011; NEUMAN,\n2005).\n\n5.1.2 Discrete Models\n\nDiscrete models allow to describe phenomena that they are able to incorporate explicitly\nthe properties of the individual fracture. These models consider each fracture independently,\ndescribing its geometric properties and the interconnection between them (BEAR; TSANG;\nMARSILY, 2012; MARIN, 2011; BERKOWITZ, 2002). Discrete-shaped fractures can be\nrepresented by uni, bi and three-dimensional elements. Parameters such as length, aperture\nand roughness are assigned to each fracture as presented in (CACAS et al., 1990; SINGHAL;\nGUPTA, 2010).\n\nDiscrete fracture networks are generally generated using statistical distributions based on\nthe properties found in the field, such as orientation, length distribution, position, density, aperture.\nOne of the problem in the use of discrete network is to obtain the data. Experimental data may\nnot be sufficient to determine some of these parameters, for which percentage of fracture actually\nconduct fluid, although the network appear to be well connected. The computational effort\nrequired for the simulation using a discrete network can be large, and simplifications such as the\nuse of parallel plate models can be used to reduce such efforts, despite the various evidences that\nsuch an approach is not sufficient to reduce the experimental results for the field or laboratory\nscale (MARIN, 2011; NEUMAN, 2005; WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002; CACAS et\nal., 1990; BERKOWITZ; SCHER, 1995; BERKOWITZ; SCHER, 1997; CVETKOVIC et al.,\n2010). Once the discrete network of fractures is generated then the flow in it must be determined.\nThe flow models are dependent on the form of the network, but are generally divided into two\nclasses: one considers that the flow occurs only in the fractures, and the other that there is also\nthe flow in the porous medium. In the first case, since the flow is contained only in the fractures,\nthe flow itself is simplified, and generally given by a linear relationship between the flow rate\nand the head gradient, with the fracture hydraulic conductivity being the proportionality constant\n(MARIN, 2011; CACAS et al., 1990).\n\nThe permeability in the fractured system is generally much larger than the permeability\nof the porous medium, which leads the velocity of the fluid in the fractures to be larger and faster\ncarrying to solute. However, delaying effects, solute diffusion and chemical reactions can occur\nin porous blocks. Thus, interaction effects between the fractured and porous medium may be\nmuch more important for transport than the flow as presented in (MARIN, 2011; WILSON et al.,\n1983; BECKER; SHAPIRO et al., 2000; POTERI, 2009; CROUCH, 1976).\n\nStrack and Jancovic? and Barnes used an Iterative Method to solve the linear systems\nresulting from the analytic elements presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). In this work,\nwe use the same methodology for solving different problems like circular inhomogeneities,\npolygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets and fractures. However, we found some\n\n\n\n5.2. Boundary Conditions 53\n\ncases where the Iterative Method did not converge, like the flow field with many fractures. This\nmotivate us to a Matrix Method to satisfy the boundary conditions in this specific problem.\n\n5.2 Boundary Conditions\n\nThe approximate equation obtained by assuming laminar flow in an elliptical fracture\nis given by Strack (STRACK, 1982) in terms of local Cartesian coordinates, where s and n are\nparallel and normal to the axis of the fracture respectively. The origin of the local coordinates\nsystem is considered at the center of the fracture. The width b of the elliptical fracture varies\nwith position, and the length is denoted by L, as shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 A fracture with local coordinates s and n\n\nSource: Strack (1982).\n\nAssuming the width b of the fracture w.r.t. its length is small, so the head along the\nfracture may be replaced by an average head. For the given two-dimensional case, the discharge\nusing cubic law presented in (STRACK, 1982; LAMB, 1932; MARIN, 2011) has the form:\n\nQs = ?? b3\n? ?\n\n? s\n, (5.1)\n\nwhere ? represents average head across the fracture, Qs [m2/s] represents the discharge through\nthe fracture and ? is defined as ? =\n\n? g\n12\u00b5\n\n, whereas ? is the unit mass of water (density of water),\n\ng is the gravity acceleration and \u00b5 is the viscosity (see further detail in (STRACK, 1982)). After\ntransforming eq. (5.1), the linear law for the dynamics of the fracture takes the form:\n\nQs = ?K+b\n? ?\n\n? s\n, (5.2)\n\nwhere the fracture is considered to be filled with a porous material with hydraulic conductivity\nK+.\n\n\n\n54 Chapter 5. Fractures\n\nContinuity of the flow in the fracture at any location ?\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n\n, n = 0, requires that\nthe discharge Qs be equal to the total inflow into the fracture, measured from the starting point,\nthat is:\n\nQs =\ns?\n\n?\nL\n2\n\n?(s)dt, ?\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n, n = 0, (5.3)\n\nwhere ?(s) [m/s] is the sum of the inflows from both sides, per unit length of the fracture. It can\nbe expressed in terms of the component qn of the specific discharge vector as shown in Figure 12,\nand may be written as:\n\n?(s) = ?\n[\nq+n ? q\n\n?\nn\n]\n. (5.4)\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Viewed for flow in the fractures (left) and in the rock (right)\n\nSource: Strack (1982).\n\nAssume that the average head ? along the fracture is equal to the head outside the\nfracture, ? , in the transverse direction, that is:\n\n? = ? ?\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n, n = 0. (5.5)\n\nUsing Cauchy-Riemann, we have:\n\nqs = ?\n? ?\n\n? s\n= ?\n\n? ?\n\n? n\n(5.6)\n\nand\nqn = ?\n\n? ?\n\n? n\n=\n\n? ?\n\n? s\n. (5.7)\n\nSo, eq. (5.4) becomes:\n\n?(s) = ?\n[\n\n? ?\n\n? s\n\n+\n\n?\n? ?\n\n? s\n\n?]\n= ?\n\n? (?+ ? ??)\n? s\n\n, (5.8)\n\nand eq. (5.3) with eq. (5.8) yields:\n\nQs = ?\ns?\n\n?\nL\n2\n\n? (?+ ? ??)\n? s\n\ndt, ?\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n, n = 0. (5.9)\n\n\n\n5.2. Boundary Conditions 55\n\nThe width of the fracture is taken to be zero at the ends and the flow that passes through the\nfracture in the direction s is also taken to be zero. Therefore, both Qs and ?+ ? ?? vanishes\nthere, and eq. (5.9) becomes:\n\nQs = ?(?+ ? ??), ?\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n, n = 0. (5.10)\n\nNow using the cubic law, eq. (5.1) may be written as:\n\nQs = ?? b3\n? ?\n\n? s\n, ?\n\nL\n2\n6 s 6\n\nL\n2\n, n = 0. (5.11)\n\nMultiplying and dividing by K, the given equation in terms of discharge potential takes the form:\n\nQs = ?\n? b3\n\nK\n? ?\n\n? s\n. (5.12)\n\nFrom eq. (5.10) and eq. (5.12), we have:\n\n? b3\n\nK\n? ?\n\n? s\n= ?+ ? ??, (5.13)\n\nand using the linear law, eq. (5.2) may be written in the form:\n\nQs =\nK+b\n\nK\n? ?\n\n? s\n= ?+ ? ??. (5.14)\n\nIn general, the discharge vector for an analytic element is given by the derivative of the\ncomplex potential, that is:\n\nW (z) = ?\nd?(z)\n\ndz\n= Qx(z)? iQy(z), (5.15)\n\nwhere Qx(z) and Qy(z) are the discharge vectors in the z-plane. Using the chain rule, for the\nZ-plane, we get:\n\nW (z) = ?\nd?(z)\n\ndz\n= ?\n\nd?(z)\ndZ\n\ndZ\ndz\n\n. (5.16)\n\nTherefore,\n\nW (z) = ?\nd?(z)\n\ndZ\n2\n\nz2 ? z1\n. (5.17)\n\nThe real part of the differentiated discharge potential rotating to the direction of the fracture s is\nequal to the discharge vector in the fracture:\n\nQs =\nd?(z)\n\nds\n= ?(W (z)ei? ), (5.18)\n\nand eq. (5.14) is therefore:\n\nQs =\nK+b\n\nK\n?(W (z)ei? ) = ?+ ? ??, (5.19)\n\nwhich shows the final expression for the boundary conditions on the fracture along its length.\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 5. Fractures\n\n5.3 Exact Solution for One Fracture\nThe space between the walls of the fracture is defined as the width b. The fracture is\n\nellipsoid as shown in Figure 11. So according to (MARIN, 2011; CROUCH, 1976), the parameter\nb is defined as:\n\nb = b*\n?\n\nZ2 ? 1. (5.20)\n\nwhere b* is the maximum width of the fracture at the center, where X = 0. Using the local\ncoordinate system Z, the width b as a function of X may be written as:\n\nb = b*\n?\n\n1 ? X 2. (5.21)\n\nFor a fracture that obey the cubic law, according to (STRACK, 1982), the given relation takes\nthe form:\n\nb = b*(1 ? X 2)\n1\n6 . (5.22)\n\nCalculating the expression of the width b of the fracture, using Joukowski transformation as\ndescribed in (MARIN, 2011) yields:\n\n(ei? ? e?i? ) = 2\n?\n\nX 2 ? 1. (5.23)\n\n2i sin(? ) = 2i\n?\n\n1 ? X 2. (5.24)\n\nsin(? ) =\n?\n\n1 ? X 2. (5.25)\n\nb = b*\n?\n\n1 ? X 2 = b* sin(? ) = b*\n?\n\n1 ? ?(Z)2. (5.26)\n\nDescribing the shape of the fracture using ellipsoid width, it should be noted that inside the\nfracture, the shape of the fracture is given by eq. (5.26), that is described by a line, where the\nboundary condition is imposed. For detail description of the behaviour of the function along\nthe element to obtain the term 2\n\n?\nX 2 ? 1 or 2i\n\n?\n1 ? X 2 see Appendix C or (MARIN, 2011;\n\nSTRACK, 1982).\n\nAccording to Strack (STRACK, 1982), the complex potential of a fracture in local\ncoordinates system may be written in the form:\n\n?(Z) = A\n(\n\nZ ?\n?\n\n(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)\n)\n, (5.27)\n\nfor which the dimensionless variables Z as defined in section 3.3, is given by:\n\nZ =\nz ?\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2)\n\n1\n2\n(z2 ? z1)\n\n, (5.28)\n\n\n\n5.4. The Complex Potential 57\n\nwhere z1 and z2 are the end points of the fracture as shown in Figure 6. This function satisfies\nthe boundary conditions described by eq. (5.19). For the solution of the flow in a fracture in an\nuniform flow field the constant A must be calculated. For this purpose, the uniform flow field as\ndescribed in section 4.4 must be converted to the local coordinate system, that takes the form:\n\n?u f (Z) = ?\n1\n2\n\nQx0 Le\ni(???u f )Z +C, (5.29)\n\nwhere Qx0 is the strength of the uniform flow, L is the length, C is a constant and must be\ncalculated from the hydraulic head at a reference point, ? is the angle of the fracture with respect\nto the x-axis and ?u f is the angle of the uniform flow with respect to the x-axis as shown in\nFigure 13.\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Angles ? and ? relative with x-axis in an uniform flow field\n\nSubstituting eq. (5.29) in eq. (5.18), after simplification, the constant A may be written\nin the form:\n\nA =\n\n1\n2\n\nK+b*\n\nKL + K+b*\nQx0 L cos(? ? ?u f ). (5.30)\n\nThis proof is presented in Appendix C.\nFinally, using eq. (5.29) and eq. (5.30), the complex potential from eq. (5.27) may be written as:\n\n?(Z) =\n\n1\n2\n\nK+b*\n\nKL + K+b*\nQx0 L cos(? ? ?u f )\n\n(\nZ ?\n\n?\n(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)\n\n)\n?\n\n1\n2\n\nQx0 Le\ni(???u f )Z +C,\n\n(5.31)\nor\n\n?(Z) = AZ ? A\n?\n(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)?\n\n1\n2\n\nQx0 Le\ni(???u f )Z +C, (5.32)\n\nwhich is the exact solution of a fracture as described in (STRACK, 1982).\n\n5.4 The Complex Potential\nIn this section inspired by the formula eq. (5.32) for one fracture, we assume the complex\n\npotential for several fractures given by eq. (5.27) can be expanded in series of power of (Z ?\n\n\n\n58 Chapter 5. Fractures\n\n?\nZ ? 1\n\n?\nZ + 1). A truncated expansion can be used as a numerical approximation for the flow\n\nfield in a domain with various fractures. The complex potential of one fracture in the domain\ntakes then the form:\n\n? j(Z) =\nN j\n\n?\nn=1\n\nan\n(\nZ j ?\n\n?\nZ j ? 1\n\n?\nZ j + 1\n\n)n\n, (5.33)\n\nwhere an are real coefficients of the element j, Z is the dimensionless variable as defined by eq.\n(5.28) and N is the order of the series expansion.\nSimilarly for more than one fracture, the complex potential takes the form:\n\n?(Z) =\nM\n\n?\nj=1\n\nN j\n\n?\nn=1\n\nan\n(\nZ j ?\n\n?\nZ j ? 1\n\n?\nZ j + 1\n\n)n\n, (5.34)\n\nwhere the index j represents the complex potential of the fracture j and M represents the total\nnumber of fractures.\n\n5.5 Determining the Unknown Coefficients\nThe unknown coefficients of the potential expansion for one fracture can be calculated\n\nusing the orthogonality of the Fourier Series. Since the discontinuity occurs in the imaginary\npart of the complex potential, the discharge Qs takes the form:\n\nQs =\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nan(e\n?in? ? ein? ) = ?2\n\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nan sin(n? ), (5.35)\n\nwhich is similar to a Fourier expansion.\nTo calculate the coefficients an, multiply both sides of eq. (5.35) by sin(m? ) and integrate in the\ninterval [0, ? ], to give:?\n\n?\n\n0\nQs sin(m? )d? = ?2\n\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nan\n?\n\n?\n\n0\nsin(n? )sin(m? )d? . (5.36)\n\nIf m = n and different from zero, then:\n\n?2\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nan\n?\n\n?\n\n0\nsin(n? )sin(m? )d? = ?2\n\n?\n\n2\n\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nan?mn. (5.37)\n\n?\n?\n\n0\nQs sin(n? )d? = ?? an. (5.38)\n\nHence,\nan = ?\n\n1\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n0\nQs sin(n? )d? . (5.39)\n\nMoreover, using the boundary conditions given by eq. (5.19), eq. (5.39) becomes:\n\nan = ?\n1\n?\n\nK+b\nK\n\n?\n?\n\n0\n?(W (z)ei? )sin(n? )d? . (5.40)\n\nSubstituting b from eq. (5.26), eq. (5.40) takes the form:\n\nan = ?\n1\n?\n\nK+b*\n\nK\n\n?\n?\n\n0\n?(W (z)ei? )sin(? )sin(n? )d? . (5.41)\n\nThis expression is used to calculate the unknown coefficients for the fractures.\n\n\n\n59\n\nCHAPTER\n\n6\nLINE-DOUBLETS AND POLYGONAL\n\nINHOMOGENEITIES\n\nThis chapter describe the problem of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets\nin an aquifer with uniform flow field and the methodology for solving it. The proposed method-\nology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM) presented in (STRACK, 1989; MARIN,\n2011).\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nThe line-doublets are used to model inhomogeneities bounded by closed polygons with\ndistinct hydraulic conductivities from that of the hydraulic medium. See the Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Aquifer consisting of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets with different\nhydraulic conductivities\n\nIn the Analytic Element Method, generally groundwater problems deals with line-\nelements (such as line-sinks, line-dipoles and line-doublets). According to (STRACK, 2014), the\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 6. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\nline-doublet is a continuous distribution of dipoles along a line having dipoles oriented normal\nto the line, as shown in Figure 15.\n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Line-dipole and line-doublet\n\n(a) A line-dipole (b) A line-doublet\n\nSource: Strack (1989).\n\nIn order to derive the complex potential for a line-doublet, first we have to derive the\ncomplex potential for a line-dipole. A line-dipole is the continuous distribution of dipoles along\na line. The complex potential for a dipole at z = z0 = x0 + iy0 is the complex function with\ndischarge potential and stream function having strength s, as presented in (STRACK, 1989) is\ngiven by:\n\n? =\ns\n\n2?\ncos(? ? ?)\n\nr\nand ? = ?\n\ns\n2?\n\nsin(? ? ?)\nr\n\n, (6.1)\n\nor\n\n?(z) = ? + i? =\ns\n\n2?\ncos(? ? ?)? i sin(? ? ?)\n\nr\n=\n\ns\n2?\n\nei?\n\nrei?\n. (6.2)\n\nThe complex number rei? represents the vector from z0 to z, therefore, rei? = z ? z0, and hence\nthe complex potential for a dipole becomes:\n\n?(z) =\ns\n\n2?\nei?\n\nz ? z0\n. (6.3)\n\nThe complex potential for a line-dipole is obtained by integrating a dipole along a line (STRACK,\n1989). Therefore, by replacing s by ?\u00b5 , z0 by ? , using a line of length L, end points z1 and z2,\nangle ? relative to the x-axis as shown in Figure 6, the integral of eq. (6.3) for a line-dipole is\nobtained as:\n\n?(z) = ?\n1\n\n2?\n\nL\n2?\n\n?\nL\n2\n\n\u00b5 ei?\n\nz ? ?\nd? , (6.4)\n\n\n\n6.1. Introduction 61\n\nwhere \u00b5 is the discharge distribution and ? is taken to be ?\nL\n2\n\nat z1 and\nL\n2\n\nat z2, which are the\nend points of the line-element.\nThe complex number ? denotes a point on the line and in terms of ? and it may be written as:\n\n? = ? ei? +\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2). (6.5)\n\nIt follows that d? = ei? d? . Hence, eq. (6.4) may be written as:\n\n?(z) = ?\n1\n\n2?\n\nz2?\nz1\n\n\u00b5\n\nz ? ?\nd? . (6.6)\n\nThe line can be mapped into the interval [?1,1] by introducing the following dimensionless\nvariables:\n\nZ = X + iY =\nz ?\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2)\n\n1\n2\n(z2 ? z1)\n\nand ? = ?1 + i?2 =\n? ?\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2)\n\n1\n2\n(z2 ? z1)\n\n, (6.7)\n\nwhere z2 ? z1 = Lei? , Z is a position in the local coordinate system associated with the line-\nelement and z1 and z2 are the end points. From eq. (6.7) it is clear that Z and ? are real along the\nelement and are mapped onto the real axis between X = ?1 and X = 1, which shows that the\ncomplex potential is analytic in the cut plane ?1 6 X 6 1. Therefore,\n\n1\n2\n(z1 + z2) corresponds to\n\nthe center, and z2 ? z1 represents a vector from z1 to z2 having length L as shown in section 3.3,\nFigure 6.\n\nNow by introducing the function \u00b5 = \u00b5(Z) which is analytic for all finite Z and using\nthe variables Z and ? defined in eq. (6.7), we get:\n\n?(Z) = ?\n1\n\n2?\n\n+1?\n?1\n\n\u00b5(?)\n\nZ ? ?\nd?. (6.8)\n\nBy adding and subtracting \u00b5(Z), eq. (6.8) becomes:\n\n?(Z) = ?\n1\n\n2?\n\n+1?\n?1\n\n\u00b5(Z)\nZ ? ?\n\nd? +\n1\n\n2?\n\n+1?\n?1\n\n\u00b5(Z)? \u00b5(?)\nZ ? ?\n\nd?. (6.9)\n\nFor the first integral, Z is constant and so the integration may be carried out to give:\n\n?(Z) =\n\u00b5(Z)\n2?\n\nln\nZ ? 1\nZ + 1\n\n+\n1\n\n2?\n\n+1?\n?1\n\n\u00b5(Z)? \u00b5(?)\nZ ? ?\n\nd?. (6.10)\n\nThe integrand in the remaining integral is analytic at Z = ? , which may be seen by expanding\n\u00b5(Z) in a Taylor series. Since the integral of an analytic function is analytic, therefore, the second\n\n\n\n62 Chapter 6. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\nterm in eq. (6.10) is also analytic for all Z and is represented symbolically as p(Z) presented in\n(STRACK, 1989). Finally, the complex potential for line-dipole becomes:\n\n?(Z) =\n\u00b5(Z)\n2?\n\nln\nZ ? 1\nZ + 1\n\n+ p(Z), (6.11)\n\nwhere p(Z) can be considered as a correction function.\n\nIn the literature, the terms line-dipole and line-doublet are arbitrary used and both are\nused for the isolated singularity. Line-doublets are used to model features in the aquifers where\nthe potential is discontinuous and the stream function is continuous. The hydraulic conductivity\njumps across the boundary of an inhomogeneity, but the head is continuous. The potential jumps,\nwhereas the stream function is continuous by the flow continuity (STRACK, 1989). As the\nline-doublet is a continuous distribution of dipoles along a line having dipoles oriented normal\nto the line. Therefore, the complex potential for a straight line-doublet using eq. (6.11), takes the\nform:\n\n?(Z) =\n1\n\n2? i\n\n(\n? (Z)ln\n\nZ ? 1\nZ + 1\n\n+ p(Z)\n)\n, (6.12)\n\nwhere the function ? (Z) called jump function which is a real polynomial along the element\nand p(Z) is the far-field correction polynomial/function that ensures that the given expression\n\napproaches zero as\n1\nZ\n\nnears infinity (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).\n\nFrom theory of approximation it is known that Chebyshev polynomials make a better\nbasis for representing the function to be approximated (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). The\njump function ? (Z) will be approximated by:\n\n? (Z) =\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(Z), (6.13)\n\nwhere an are real coefficients, Tn are Chebyshev polynomials and N is the order of the given\nChebyshev series. As the given expression is real along the element, therefore, it may be written\nin the form:\n\n? (X) =\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(X), (6.14)\n\nas presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). The Chebyshev polynomials are defined by\nTn(cos ? ) = cos(n? ) and may be used in the expansion of the jump function ? (X) in a Fourier\ncosine series in terms of ? , where X = cos ? see (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).\nSimilarly, the far-field correction function p(Z) may be written in the form:\n\np(Z) =\n1\n\n2? i\n\n?\n\n?\nn=1\n\nn?1\n\n?\np=0\n\nanZ\np\n(\n\n1n?p ?(?1)n?p\n\nn ? p\n\n)\n, (6.15)\n\nsee (MARIN, 2011). Hence, the complex potential for a line-doublet from eq. (6.12) using eq.\n(6.13) and eq. (6.15) becomes:\n\n?(Z) =\n1\n\n2? i\n\n(\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(Z)ln\nZ ? 1\nZ + 1\n\n+\n?\n\n?\nn=1\n\nn?1\n\n?\np=0\n\nanZ\np\n(\n\n1n?p ?(?1)n?p\n\nn ? p\n\n))\n, (6.16)\n\n\n\n6.2.

(6.18)\n\n6.2 Boundary Conditions\n\nThe boundary conditions for line-doublets are similar to those of circular inhomogeneities,\nin which the hydraulic head must be continuous at the interface, that is:\n\n?\n+(? ) = ? ?(? ), (6.19)\n\nwhere ? +(? ) is the head inside the inhomogeneity and ? ?(? ) is the head outside the inho-\nmogeneity. By definition, the only component that have a jump is the discharge potential of\nthe complex potential ? for the element j see (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999). Therefore, the\ncontinuity condition of head at the edge of the element j in terms of discharge potential can be\nwritten as:\n\n?\n+(?l)\n\nK+j\n=\n\n?\n?(?l)\n\nK\n, (6.20)\n\nwhere ?l denotes a point on the interface, the + and ? signs shows the sides of the element as\nshown in Figure 16, that are considered as internal and external parts for polygons. K+j and K are\nthe internal and external hydraulic conductivities of bounded polygons as shown in Figure 17.\n\nFigure 16 \u2013 A line-doublet with + and ? sides in local coordinate system Z\n\nSource: Marin (2011).\n\nThe real part of the complex potential ? is discontinuous and the imaginary part is\ncontinuous across the interface. Therefore, in order to create the jump in the complex potential\nacross the element (line-doublet), the highest order terms of the series are used whereas all the\nother terms are the correction terms (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).\n\n\n\n64 Chapter 6. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 A polygon representing a region (inhomogeneity) with different hydraulic conductivity from\nthe background\n\nSource: Marin (2011).\n\nThe function ln((Z ? 1)/(Z + 1)) on the element itself is:\n\nln\nZ ? 1\nZ + 1\n\n=\n\n???????\n??????\n\nln\n????X ? 1X + 1\n\n????+ i? for ? 1 &lt;X &lt;1, Y = 0+\nln\n????X ? 1X + 1\n\n????? i? for ? 1 &lt;X &lt;1, Y = 0?\n, (6.21)\n\nwhere (+) shows the left side of the element when its going from the first point to the second\nand (?) shows the right side. Since, all the correction terms are real along the element and do\nnot contribute to the discharge potential, on the element the discharge potentials for left and right\nsides will become:\n\n?(X,0+) =\n1\n2\n\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(X), (6.22)\n\nand\n\n?(X,0?) = ?\n1\n2\n\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(X). (6.23)\n\nAfter simplification the jump in the discharge potential becomes:\n\n??(X) = ?(X,0+)? ?(X,0?) =\nN\n\n?\nn=0\n\nanTn(X), (6.24)\n\nwhich shows the jump function ? (X) as presented in eq. (6.14). The stream function is continuous\n\nacross the element due to the function ln\n????X ? 1X + 1\n\n????, that does not jump across the element. Hence,\neq. (6.22) and eq. (6.23) are used to determine the unknown coefficients for line-doublets.\n\n6.3 Determining the Unknown Coefficients\n\nThis section presents similar techniques to those in section 4.3 for calculating the\nunknown coefficients.\n\n\n\n6.3.

Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\n6.4 Selecting the Control Points\nThe location of the control points is selected to avoid the singularities caused by the\n\nfunction ln((Z ? 1)/(Z + 1)) that are ?1 and 1 as Chebyshev control points. Such control points\ncan be chosen as:\n\nX m = cos\n(\n\n?(m ? 0.5)\nM j\n\n)\n, (6.57)\n\nwhere m = 1,2,...,M j. For a large number of functions the Chebyshev control Points yield near\noptimal approximations (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; CHENEY, ).\n\n\n\n69\n\nCHAPTER\n\n7\nSOLUTION ALGORITHM\n\nDifferent strategies have been used to satisfy the boundary conditions in the AEM. The\nfirst was the collocation, proposed in (STRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA, 1995). It uses predefined\npoints on the element (such as well, line-doublet, circle, fracture etc.) called collocation points,\nwhere the boundary conditions are enforced exactly. Each element has a fixed number of degrees\nof freedom, denoting the analytic element order: a first order element strength is given by\na polynomial expansion of order one, with two degrees of freedom, and has two associated\ncollocation points. A system of equations is constructed requiring that the boundary conditions\nmust be satisfied exactly on the collocation points over the element. For example, given a section\nof a river with a specified head, it can be modelled using a line-sink element with a given\ncontribution computed in such a way that the discharge potential of all the elements gives the\nspecified head value at the collocation points. This method suffers when applied to high-order\nelements and has been extensively discussed in the literature, see (STRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA,\n1995; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; BATISTA, 2006; NETO; FRANCA, 2008). Later, Strack\nand Jancovic? and Barnes developed the idea of overspecification, where the number of control\npoints over the element is higher than the number of degrees of freedom for each element, and\nthe boundary conditions are satisfied in a least square sense over the control points presented in\n(JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999).\nThey used an Iterative Method to solve the linear systems resulting from the analytic elements\nsee (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). This method has the advantage that no matrix needs to be\nconstructed explicitly, saving computer memory. In general fast convergence is achieved for the\nmost types of elements using this method, with high order elements (up to 75) and a relative low\noverspecification fold. We use the same methodology for solving different problems like circular\ninhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets and fractures. However,\nwe found some cases where the Iterative Method did not converge, like the flow field with many\nfractures (MARIN; WENDLAND; STRACK, 2012; MARIN, 2011). This motivate us to develop\nthe Matrix Method to satisfy the boundary conditions in this specific problem.\n\n\n\n70 Chapter 7. Solution Algorithm\n\n7.1 Solution Algorithm for Circular Inhomogeneities\n\nThe unknown coefficients of the analytical elements (circles) can be found from eq.\n(4.14), that takes the form:\n\nai,n = Pi,n\n? 2?\n\n0\n?(?T (?i))e\n\n?in?i d?i, (7.1)\n\nor\n\nai,n = Pi,n\n? 2?\n\n0\n? ?= j(?i)e\n\n?in?i d?i, (7.2)\n\nwhich calculate the nth unknown coefficient for the circle i, where ?T is the complex potential of\nall the elements. The discharge potential ??= j is the real part of the sum of the complex potential\nof all other elements present in the system, including the uniform regional flow as given by eq.\n(4.19). Equation (7.1) gives rise to a set of linear equations that can be solved by two distinct\ntechniques: The Iterative Method and the Matrix Method.\n\n7.1.1 Iterative Method\n\nConsider a system of circular inhomogeneities having M circles in an uniform flow field\nand a well. The expression to calculate the unknown coefficients for the element/circle i using\neq. (7.1) becomes:\n\nai,n = Pi,n\nM\n\n?\nj ?=i\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(? j(Z j(?i)))e\n?in?i d?i + Pi,n\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))e\n?in?i d?i, (7.3)\n\nor\n\nak+1i,n = Pi,n\nM\n\n?\nj ?=i\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(? j(Z j(?i)))e\n?in?i d?i + Pi,n\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))e\n?in?i d?i, (7.4)\n\nwhere k counts the steps of the iterative process and i shows a specific element. The regional\nuniform flow ?u f (?i) is the same as defined in eq. (4.19), the complex potential of the well\n?w(?i) is the same as defined in eq. (4.20) and\n\nPi,n =\n\n??????\n?????\n\n1\n2?\n\n(\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n\n)\nf or n = 0\n\n1\n?\n\n(\nK+j ? K\nK + K+j\n\n)\nf or n > 0\n\n. (7.5)\n\nThe coefficients a0j,m are initialized with zero. The terms on the right hand side of eq. (7.2) are\nassumed to be known and are used for calculating coefficients ai,n . The updated coefficients are\nthen used for calculating the coefficients of the next element. This process continues until the\nvariation in the coefficients between the iterations is less than a certain specified value ? . This\nmethod is described in (MARIN, 2011; JANKOVIC?, 1997; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b).\n\n\n\n7.1. Solution Algorithm for Circular Inhomogeneities 71\n\n7.1.2 Matrix Method\n\nDespite that the Iterative Method comes out quite naturally from eq. (7.1), is easy to\nunderstand and implement, it sometimes fail to converge. For this reason it may be necessary to\nform the coefficient matrix A of the linear system\n\nAx = b (7.6)\n\nand solve it using appropriate techniques for linear systems. The matrix A is constructed from\nthe expansion in power series of the potential of circular inhomogeneities. The known vector b\nin eq. (7.6) results from the contribution of the uniform flow and the well. After simplification\neq. (7.3) can be rewritten in the form:\n\nai,n\nPi,n\n\n?\nM\n\n?\nj ?=i\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(?(Z j,i(?i))e\n?in?i d?i ?\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n?(C)e?in?i d?i\n\n=\n? 2?\n\n0\n?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))e\n\n?in?i d?i,\n\n(7.7)\n\nand is used to calculate the unknown coefficients in the Matrix Method, whereas the uniform\nflow, well and the conductivity relation are the same as in eq.

The analytical solution known from (STRACK,\n1989) is shown in Figure 19 and its comparison with the numerical solution is shown in Figure 20,\nwhich is obtained with parameters given in Table 1. By comparing the analytical solution defined\nin section 4.4 with the numerical solution of the problem, we found out that the relative error\n(see Appendix D) is 9.5 \u00d7 10?17, which is the order of machine epsilon.\n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Analytic solution of a circular inhomogeneity in an uniform flow field with larger hydraulic\nconductivity than the background.

Note\n\n\n\n8.1. Circular Inhomogeneities 87\n\nthat the streamlines avoid to enter the inhomogeneities, whereas the piezometric contours do.\nThis occurs due to the lower hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneities. It means that the\npermeability inside the inhomogeneities is lower than the medium.\n\nThe problem shown in Figure 24 consists of 5 circular inhomogeneities randomly dis-\ntributed with parameters given in Table 3, and a well of discharge Qw = 100 m3/day located\nat point zw instead of uniform flow in the domain.

Results and Discussion\n\nAll the results show the behaviour of the streamlines and piezometric contours and it\nis noticed that when the hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneities is greater than the\nmedium, the streamlines enter the inhomogeneities whereas the piezometric contours avoid to\nenter due to high permeability or vice versa. During simulations it is observed that the Iterative\nMethod as well as the Matrix Method gives the same results in all the examined cases.\n\n8.2 Fractures\nIn this section different configurations of fracture systems submitted to uniform flow are\n\nevaluated. The fractures present different hydraulic conductivities and the resulting system of\nequations is solved both by the Iterative and the Matrix Method.\n\n8.2.1 Comparison with Analytical Solution\n\nWe start with the case that simulates the influence of a single fracture oriented parallel\nto the uniform flow. This problem has an analytical solution as proposed by (STRACK, 1982).\nThe uniform flow is of 0.5 m /day and the background conductivity of the aquifer is 1 m/day.\nThe elliptical fracture with an aperture of 0.01 meter has a hydraulic conductivity of 1000 m/day,\nwhich is 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the aquifer. The order of expansion for the\nnumerical solutions is N = 10.\n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Analytic solution of a fracture centered at origin in an uniform flow along horizontal direction\nobtained by the matrix method.

Obviously the error is larger close\nto the fracture, where the influence of the expansion approximation is larger. The error is also\n\n\n\n92 Chapter 8.

In the analytical solution the geometry of the fracture is\nelliptic, while in the numerical expansion, the fracture presents constant width. Nevertheless\nthis comparison demonstrates that the numerical expansion seems to approximate well analytic\nsolution.\n\nFigure 29 \u2013 Absolute and Relative errors.

In all the cases, the Iterative Method failed to converge\nand the problem was solved by the Matrix Method proposed in this work.\n\nIn the first example we have 3 fractures parallel to each other and oriented at an angle\nof 30? to the uniform flow. The fracture parameters are given in Table 5. In this case there is\nno analytical solution for verification of the results. However the resulting flow field is sound\nand resembles the expected streamlines behaviour. The uniform flow is disturbed by the high\nconductive fractures leading the flow through its narrow widths.\n\nFigure 30 \u2013 3 parallel fractures of different hydraulic conductivities and lengths in an uniform flow field\noriented with an angle of 30? to the horizontal direction.

Again the high conductive fractures control the streamline path and hydraulic head distri-\nbution. The details demonstrate the ability of the method to simulate the flow field at different\nscales. Despite the short distance between orthogonal fractures (1 and 2) the piezometric contours\nare continuous through the fractures and the streamlines demonstrate the mass conservation.\n\n\n\n94 Chapter 8.

Results and Discussion\n\nFigure 32 presents a more general flow field controlled by a system of 10 fractures ran-\ndomly distributed in the domain. The fractures parameters are presented in Table 7. The uniform\nflow is oriented 30? to the horizontal and is strongly affected by the fractures. Nevertheless the\nresulting streamlines are continuous and describe adequately the expected flow in this domain.\n\n8.2.3 Convergence Analysis\n\nIn the simulations presented in Figures 30 to 32, it was observed that the Iterative Method\ndiverged. The Matrix Method, using a direct solver, managed to find a suitable solution for the\nflow field for a system of fractures. Following the observed behaviour a convergence analysis\nhas been done by the criteria presented in subsection 7.2.3 in this work.\n\n8.2.3.1 Increasing Fracture Hydraulic Conductivity\n\nIn order to evaluate the matrix eigenvalues, 3 different geometries of fracture systems in\nuniform flow were evaluated. These geometries were randomly distributed fractures (geometries\n1 and 2) as well as parallel oriented fractures (geometry 3). In the first simulation all the fractures\nhave the same hydraulic conductivity K+ = 1000 m/day and width b = 0.01 m. The background\naquifer conductivity is 1 m/day and the uniform flow is along the horizontal direction. In the\nfollowing simulations the hydraulic conductivity of one fracture (fracture 4 in each geometry) is\nsuccessively increased.\n\nThe maximal eigenvalue obtained for the matrix in each case is presented as a function\nof the growing factor P, calculated as the product of Pi,n and Gc. Pi,n is defined in eq. (7.17) and\nGc is a geometric constant, obtained from the integral function of the fractures, as defined in eq.\n(7.22).\n\nFigure 34 shows the maximum eigenvalue obtained for the proposed geometries and\nincreasing hydraulic conductivity. The hydraulic conductivity increased from K+ = 102 m/day\nto K+ = 106 m/day only for one fracture. In the first case, P = 5 \u00d7 10?2; whereas for the last\none P = 5 \u00d7 102.\n\nThe analysis of the eigenvalues of the matrix G, presented in subsection 7.2.3, shows\nthat the maximum eigenvalue becomes larger than 1, even in the first case for geometry 2. This\nis the reason for convergence failure of the Iterative Method.\n\nFigure 34 also shows that all the systems depend on the internal hydraulic conductivities\nas well as the orientations of the fractures.\n\n\n\n8.2.

In this case we found almost the same results as mentioned in\nsubsection 8.2.2, whereas the hydraulic conductivities inside the fractures is 10 times greater than\nthe previous ones.

Moreover, after simulating the problems using line-doublets to form different\npolygonal inhomogeneities and fractures, it is observed that the Iterative Method converges in all\nthe cases and gives the same results by comparing with the Matrix Method.\n\n8.3.5 Error Analysis\n\nAn error analysis has been done for both the polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. It\nconsists of different grids which are gradually refined by twice the previous ones. This analysis\n\n\n\n8.3. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities 109\n\nwas done using a single circular polygon and fracture, centered at the origin. In both cases, a\ncomparison was made between the line-doublets and the relative error as shown in Figures 48\nand 49.

Results and Discussion\n\n8.4 Computational Performance\n\nDifferent problems such as circular inhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities and\nfractures were solved by the AEM to compare the processing time for both the Iterative and the\nMatrix Method. In such cases, it is observed that the Iterative Method takes more processing\ntime than the Matrix Method with high order of series expansion using the same systems. In our\nsimulation both the Matrix and the Iterative algorithm codes are shared, with only the difference\nin the system solver, so the comparison was made using only our solver for both cases.\n\nSome comparisons were made between the processing times of both the Iterative and the\nMatrix Method in this work. Figure 50 illustrate the processing time of both the Iterative and the\nMatrix Method for the problem consists of 10 circular inhomogeneities as shown in Figure 25,\nand Figure 51 illustrate the processing time of the Matrix Method (because the Iterative Method\ndid not converge for more than one fracture) for the problem consists of 10 fractures as shown in\nFigure 32. After simulating the problems, it is noticed that the Matrix Method is much faster than\nthe Iterative Method as illustrated in Figures 50 and 51. This means that the computational cost\nof the Matrix Method is lower. This is because the Iterative solver takes a large number of steps\nto satisfy the convergence criterion. The matrix solver needs to fully construct the coefficients\nmatrix in the first step, and then need to solve the system once.\n\nFigure 50 \u2013 Comparison between the processing times, obtained from simulation of the system of circular\ninhomogeneities shown in Figure 25, by both the Iterative and Matrix Method.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\nApproximate order of series expansion\n\nt(\ns\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nMatrix Method\n\nIterative Method\n\n\n\n8.4.

Several problems were simulated and described in detail such as: circular\ninhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. All the simulations are programmed\nin Matlab R2014a and processed on a Core i7 Intel Processor computer.\n\nCircular inhomogeneities were simulated using both the Iterative and the Matrix Method\nand almost identical results were obtained. The agreement of the numerical solution with the\nexact solution was excellent, with relative error smaller than machine precision. The complex\npotential for circular inhomogeneities as well as the iterative solution are known in the literature\n(JANKOVIC?, 1997; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN, 2011). The implementation and\nresults were compared to the existing literature. The results for circular inhomogeneities served\nas the basis for the comparison and verification of the polygonal inhomogeneities using line-\ndoublets.\n\nPolygonal inhomogeneities were implemented using line-doublets as analytical elements.\nThe complex potential for the line-doublet and the implementation for the iterative algorithm\nwas based on (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; MARIN, 2011). In this case, the numerical\nsolution of a polygonal circular inhomogeneity was compared with the exact solution of a\ncircular inhomogeneity, whereas a polygonal ellipsoidal inhomogeneity using line-doublets\nwas compared with the exact solution of a single fracture as described in (STRACK, 1982).\nSuch comparisons were found excellent with satisfactory results. All the systems resulting from\nline-doublets were solved by both the Iterative and the Matrix Method and almost identical\nresults were obtained.\n\nThe complex potential for a discrete fracture system in porous medium was developed in\nthis work, based on the exact solution for one single fracture (STRACK, 1982). This complex\npotential for one fracture was analysed and implemented by both the Iterative and the Matrix\nMethod and the agreement of the numerical solution with the exact solution was found excellent.\n\n\n\n114 Chapter 9. Conclusion\n\nHowever, during simulations it is observed that the Iterative Method did not converge for some\ncases, as for instance the flow field with many fractures. This fact led to the Matrix Method to\nsolve the linear system.\n\nThe main contributions in this work are the development of the Matrix Method and the\nconvergence analysis of the Iterative Method. The Matrix Method was developed by imposing\nthe intern boundary conditions for the Analytic Element Method. This method, using a direct\nsolver, managed to find the correct solutions for the system of fractures. The Matrix Method\ntakes advantage of the results of the Cauchy\u2019s integral, using the orthogonality of the basic\nfunctions of the expansion of the analytical elements for the construction of the matrix.\n\nMoreover, the divergence of the Iterative Method motivated the study of the behaviour\nof the iterative solutions to the proposed problems using Gauss-Seidel partition. The spectral\nradius of the Iterative system was analysed, and cases were observed where the spectral radius\nis larger than 1, which indicates that the convergence of the system to an initial solution vector\nis not guaranteed. The spectral radius being larger than 1 for the Iterative Method indicated\nnon-convergence of some systems, especially in the case of fractures, and cannot be applied to\nall analytic element methods in all cases.\n\nIn general, it is common in numerical simulation and computation that there is a com-\npromise between memory usage and processing time. The computational cost of the Iterative\nMethod is higher in processing time and less in memory use, whereas in the Matrix Method\nthe inverse occurs. Higher memory usage leads to lower processing costs, and vice versa. This\nrelation was observed in the comparison of the solution of the same problem to the Iterative and\nthe Matrix Method.\n\n\n\n115\n\nCHAPTER\n\n10\nFUTURE WORK\n\nIn this thesis we developed a numerical solution for discrete models of fracture networks,\nas presented in Chapter 5. In the series expansion, the unknown coefficients are obtained from\nthe discharge potentials of all other elements that are related to the expansion coefficients. The\nprocedure is applied to two-dimensional groundwater flow in fractured porous media by the\nAnalytic Element Method (AEM) and it is observed that the resulting flow field looks correct\nand resembles the expected streamlines behaviour in all the examined cases. This motivates us to\nwork with more complex problems such as crossing fractures as shown in Figure 52.\n\nIn the literature we found some of the formulation for the crossing fractures as presented\nin (STRACK, 1982). This formulation is modelled by the complex potential of the line-doublets\n(line-segments). If we follow the method developed in (STRACK, 1982), we need to simulate\nminimum eight line-doublets to approximate two crossing fractures as shown in Figure 52, which\nwill be computationally costly as observed in this thesis. Thus, we try to generalize the approach\npresented in this thesis for crossing fractures using the conditions prescribed at the crossing as\ndescribed in (STRACK, 1982).\n\nFigure 52 \u2013 Two crossing fractures.\n\n\n\n\n\n117\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBAKKER, M.

(B.4)\n\nLet the total discharge potential be:\n? = K f (?). (B.5)\n\nwhere K is the hydraulic conductivity and f (?) is some function of the head. The head is\ncontinuous across the boundary of the inhomogeneity and therefore the condition is given by:\n\n?\n+\n\n??\n=\n\nK f (? +)\nK f (? ?)\n\n=\nK+j\nK\n\nzz = R2, (B.6)\n\nwhere K+j is the hydraulic conductivity inside the circle j, K is outside and R is the radius at the\nboundary. There is a jump in potential across the boundary, which we represent as ? and\n\n? = ?+ ? ?? =\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n?\n\n? zz = R2. (B.7)\n\n\n\n128 APPENDIX B. Exact Solution of a Circle\n\nAccording to (STRACK, 2014), we can use the complex potential of an impermeable cylindrical\nobject in a field of uniform flow, which is similar to the case of the circular lake/inhomogeneity\nto obtain the required results, that is:\n\n? = ?Qx0\n(\n\nz +\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\n+C. (B.8)\n\nSuppose that,\n\n?1 = ?aQx0\n(\n\nz +\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\nif zz > R2 (B.9)\n\nand\n?1 = C1 if zz &lt;R\n\n2, ?C1 = 0, (B.10)\n\nwhere Qx0 is the intensity of the uniform flow along the horizontal direction, z = x + iy is the\nposition of a point in the complex plane, R is the radius of the circle, a and C1 are constants.\nWe add a second complex potential ?2 throughout the flow domain as described in (STRACK,\n2014), i.e.\n\n?2 = (a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0 ?z, (B.11)\n\nwhere ?0 is the discharge potential at a reference point with a known head. The potential on the\noutside is ?1 + ?2, therefore,\n\n? = ?1 + ?2. (B.12)\n\nUsing eq. (B.9) and eq. (B.11), eq. (B.12) takes the form:\n\n? = ?aQx0\n(\n\nz +\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\n+(a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0 for zz > R\n\n2. (B.13)\n\n? = ?Qx0\n(\n\nz + a\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\n+ ?0. (B.14)\n\nNow using the boundary conditions, let r = R and z = Rei? . Suppose that,\n\n?1 = ?\n+\n1 ? ?\n\n?\n1 . (B.15)\n\nUsing eq. (B.9) and eq. (B.10), eq. (B.15) takes the form:\n\n?1 = C1 + aQx0\n\n(\nRei? +\n\nR2\n\nR\ne?i?\n\n)\n. (B.16)\n\nor\n?1 = C1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? . (B.17)\n\nAs there is no jump in the uniform flow, therefore:\n\n?2 = 0, (B.18)\n\nand\n? = ?1 + ?2 = C1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? . (B.19)\n\n\n\nB.1. Exact Solution 129\n\nAt the boundary using eq. (B.7), eq. (B.14) becomes:\n\n?\n? = ?Qx0\n\n(\nRei? + a\n\nR2\n\nR\ne?i?\n\n)\n+ ?0. (B.20)\n\nLet, ?? = ?? + i??. Therefore,\n\n?\n? = ?Qx0 (R cos ? + aR cos ? )?0, (B.21)\n\nwhich is the real part of the complex potential.\nSubstituting eq. (B.21) into eq. (B.7), we get:\n\n? =\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n[?Qx0 R cos ? (1 + a)+ ?0]. (B.22)\n\n? = ?\nK+j ? K\n\nK\nQx0 R cos ? (1 + a)+\n\nK+j ? K\nK\n\n?0. (B.23)\n\nBy comparing the values of ? from eq. (B.19) and eq. B.23), we may write:\n\nC1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? =\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n?0 ?\n\nK+j ? K\nK\n\nQx0 R cos ? (1 + a). (B.24)\n\nFrom eq. (B.24), we can also write:\n\nC1 =\nK+j ? K\n\nK\n?0, (B.25)\n\nand\n\n2aQx0 R cos ? = ?\nK+j ? K\n\nK\nQx0 R cos ? (1 + a). (B.26)\n\na = ?\nK+j ? K\nK+j + K\n\n. (B.27)\n\nSubstituting value of a into eq. (B.14) yields:\n\n? = ?Qx0\n\n(\nz ?\n\nK+j ? K\nK+j + K\n\nR2\n\nz\n\n)\n+ ?0 for zz > R\n\n2. (B.28)\n\nUsing eq. (B.10) and eq. (B.11), eq. (B.12) takes the form:\n\n? = C1 +(a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0. (B.29)\n\nSince,\n\na = ?\nK+j ? K\nK+j + K\n\n. (B.30)\n\na ? 1 = ?\nK+j ? K\nK+j + K\n\n? 1. (B.31)\n\n\n\n130 APPENDIX B. Exact Solution of a Circle\n\na ? 1 =\n?K+j + K ? K\n\n+\nj ? K\n\nK+j + K\n. (B.32)\n\na ? 1 =\n2K+j\n\nK+j + K\n. (B.33)\n\nSubstituting the values of C1 and (a ? 1) from eq. (B.25) and eq.(B.33) in eq. (B.29) we get:\n\n? = ?\n2K+j\n\nK+j + K\nQx0 z +\n\nK+j\nK\n\n?0 for zz &lt;R\n2.

The processing of the numerical algorithm is generally made on a computer.\nComputers due to their limitations have the restriction that they only work with discrete and\nfinite representations of continuous quantities, like mathematical and physical models which\nmay include continuous and discrete quantities. This limitation is one of the origin of the error\nassociated to numerical models (MARIN, 2011; PRESS, 2007). Other source of the error is the\ntruncation error, associated to the numerical model itself. The truncation error arises from the\nfinite quantity of memory of a computer to use of finite series and require to compute discrete\nquantities of continuous variables (MARIN, 2011; PRESS, 2007). An example of a truncation\nerror is the error that arises when calculating an integral, computing the function to be integrated\nin a discrete set of points.\n\nThere are two ways to calculate the error: the absolute error and the relative error. The\nabsolute error is defined as the magnitude of the difference between the values of the exact and\nthe numerical solution, and is given by:\n\nAbsoluteerror = ? abs(Exactsolution(xi)? Numericalsolution(xi)). (D.1)\n\nThe relative error is defined as the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the exact value for\ndefined points, and is given by:\n\nRelativeerror = ? abs\n(\n\nExactsolution(xi)? Numericalsolution(xi)\nExactsolution(xi)\n\n)\n. (D.2)\n\nMapping of error values are obtained by evaluating the absolute and the relative error for the\ncontrol points of the given domain. For each point of the domain, the absolute or relative error is\ncalculated and the results plot by the graphs.\n\n\n\nU\nN\n\nIV\nER\n\nSI\nD\n\nA\nD\n\nE \nD\n\nE \nS\u00c3\n\nO\n P\n\nA\nU\n\nLO\nIn\n\nst\nit\n\nu\nto\n\n d\ne \n\nC\ni\u00ea\n\nn\nci\n\nas\n M\n\nat\nem\n\n\u00e1t\nic\n\nas\n e\n\n d\ne \n\nC\no\n\nm\np\n\nu\nta\n\n\u00e7\u00e3\no\n\n\n\tTitle page\n\tTitle page\n\tDedication\n\tAcknowledgements\n\tEpigraph\n\tAbstract\n\tResumo\n\tList of Figures\n\tList of Tables\n\tList of symbols\n\tContents\n\tIntroduction\n\tBasic Equations\n\tDarcy's Law\n\tRectilinear Flow\n\tGeneral form of Darcy's Law\n\n\tContinuity of Flow\n\tDivergence\n\n\tBasic Equations of Groundwater flow\n\n\tAnalytic Element Method\n\tIntroduction\n\tMethods for satisfying the Boundary Conditions\n\tCoordinates Transformation\n\n\tCircular Inhomogeneities\n\tIntroduction\n\tBoundary Conditions\n\tDetermining the Unknown Coefficients\n\tOrthogonality of Fourier Series\n\tLeast Square Approach\n\n\tExact Solution for One Circular Inhomogeneity\n\tThe Uniform Flow\n\tThe Well\n\n\tFractures\n\tIntroduction\n\tContinuous Models\n\tDiscrete Models\n\n\tBoundary Conditions\n\tExact Solution for One Fracture\n\tThe Complex Potential\n\tDetermining the Unknown Coefficients\n\n\tLine-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\tIntroduction\n\tBoundary Conditions\n\tDetermining the Unknown Coefficients\n\tOrthogonality of Fourier Series \n\tLeast Square Approach\n\n\tSelecting the Control Points\n\n\tSolution Algorithm\n\tSolution Algorithm for Circular Inhomogeneities\n\tIterative Method\n\tMatrix Method\n\n\tSolution Algorithm for Fractures\n\tIterative Method\n\tMatrix Method\n\tConvergence Test\n\n\tSolution Algorithm for Line-doublets\n\tIterative Method\n\tMatrix Method\n\n\n\tResults and Discussion\n\tCircular Inhomogeneities\n\tComparison with the Analytical Solution\n\tSimulation for a cluster of Circular Inhomogeneities\n\n\tFractures\n\tComparison with Analytical Solution\n\tSimulation for a cluster of Fractures\n\tConvergence Analysis\n\tIncreasing Fracture Hydraulic Conductivity\n\n\n\tLine-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\tComparison with Analytical Solution of a Circle\n\tSimulation for a cluster of Polygonal Inhomogeneities\n\tComparison with Analytical solution of a Fracture\n\tSimulation for a cluster of Fractures\n\tError Analysis\n\n\tComputational Performance\n\n\tConclusion\n\tFuture Work\n\tBibliography\n\tDetermining the Unknown Coefficients\n\tOrthogonality of Fourier Series\n\tLeast Square Approach\n\n\tExact Solution of a Circle\n\tExact Solution\n\n\tThe Constant for the Exact Solution of a Fracture\n\tThe Constant A\n\n\tRelative Error\n\tError Analysis"}]}}}
