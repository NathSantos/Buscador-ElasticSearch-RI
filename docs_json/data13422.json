DIAS NETO***\n\nKeywords: Transpression, flower structure, deformation partition, antithetical kinematics, Ribeira Fold Belt.\n\nAbstract: New structural analysis and petrological results on granulites from the central segment of Ribeira Fold Belt indicate that the\nregional thrusts D1 (245-260\u00b0, 55-70\u00b0 NW) was coeval with the high grade peak metamorphism at 565 \u2013 575 Ma, post-dating earlier collision related\nnappe thrusts at 630 \u2013 610 Ma (D0). These were mostly erased by D2 thrusting and long-term dextral transpressional shearing (50-65\u00b0, 70-85\u00b0NW),\nsimultaneous with very slow cooling of the orogen until 480 \u2013 520 Ma. Brittle, extensional, tectonic event D3 (290-320\u00b0, subvertical) is associated\nwith late granite emplacement in the area, being followed by tectonic collapse that resulted in rapid exhumation/cooling of the high grade rocks\nat ~ 470 Ma. Results suggest that a > 35 Ma period of nearly orthogonal shortening between the San Francisco and West Congo cratons occurred until\n565 Ma with development of the D1 flower thrust system. Afterwards, when rocks could not absorb further orthogonal shortening, D2 dextral trans-\npressive regime became dominant, turning the flower structure asymmetric. Specific positioning within the flower structure and partition of deforma-\ntion induced \u201clocal\u201d antithetical sinistral kinematics within the main regional dextral regime and differential exhumation: granulites in the central axis\nwere rapidly exhumed, whereas along the lateral branches exhumation was much slower resulting in very slow cooling that lasted for almost 100 Ma. \n\nPalavras-chave: Transpress\u00e3o, estrutura em flor, parti\u00e7\u00e3o da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o, cinem\u00e1tica antit\u00e9tica, Faixa Ribeira.\n\nResumo: An\u00e1lise estrutural e resultados petrol\u00f3gicos recentes em granulitos da zona central da Faixa Ribeira indicam que a fase de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o D1\n(cavalgamentos de alta temperatura: 245-260\u00b0, 55-70\u00b0 NW) foi simult\u00e2nea com o pico metam\u00f3rfico, atingido aos 565 \u2013 575 Ma, ap\u00f3s os epis\u00f3dios coli-\nsionais com imbrica\u00e7\u00e3o de nappes h\u00e1 630 \u2013 610 Ma (D0). Os marcadores cinem\u00e1ticos de D0 e D1 foram abundantemente apagados pela fase de defor-\nma\u00e7\u00e3o D2. Esta apresentou uma componente cavalgante e, fundamentalmente, de cisalhamento direito (50-65\u00b0, 70-85\u00b0 NW), associada a transpress\u00e3o\ndireita de longa dura\u00e7\u00e3o, relacionada com uma prolongada taxa de arrefecimento do or\u00f3geno que durou at\u00e9 480 \u2013 520 Ma. O evento tect\u00f3nico D3, fr\u00e1gil\ne em regime extensional (290-320\u00b0, subvertical), associado a relaxamento t\u00e9rmico e \u00e0 instala\u00e7\u00e3o de granitos tardios na \u00e1rea, foi seguido pelo colapso\norog\u00e9nico, aumentando drasticamente as taxas de arrefecimento h\u00e1 ~ 470 Ma. \n\nOs resultados sugerem que ter\u00e1 ocorrido um per\u00edodo de > 35 Ma de encurtamento ortogonal entre o Crat\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Francisco e o Crat\u00e3o do\nCongo Ocidental, at\u00e9 h\u00e1 565 Ma, com o desenvolvimento da estrutura em flor D1. Posteriormente, quando as rochas deixaram de suportar encurtamento,\no regime transpressivo direito D2 tornou-se predominante, tornando a estrutura em flor assim\u00e9trica. O posicionamento espec\u00edfico no interior da estru-\ntura em flor e a exist\u00eancia de uma forte parti\u00e7\u00e3o da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o induziu cinem\u00e1tica antit\u00e9tica esquerda em alguns locais, dentro da estrutura predomi-\nnantemente direita, bem como exuma\u00e7\u00e3o diferencial: os granulitos na zona central da estrutura foram rapidamente exumados, enquanto nos ramos\nlaterais a exuma\u00e7\u00e3o procedeu-se de uma forma mais lenta, resultando em taxas de arrefecimento muito baixas que duraram quase 100 Ma.\n\nComunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas, 2009, t. 96, pp. 101-122\n\n* LNEG \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Energia e Geologia, Estrada da Portela \u2013 Zambujal \u2013 Alfragide, 2720-866 Amadora, Portugal\n(1Corresponding author: telmo.santos@ineti.pt);  \n\n** Centro/Departamento de Geologia, Universidade de Lisboa, Edif\u00edcio C6, 3\u00ba, Campo Grande, 1749-016 Lisboa, Portugal. pefonseca@fc.ul.pt;  \n*** Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Rua do Lago, 562 \u2013 Butant\u00e3, CEP: 05508-080, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. ccgtassi@usp.br. \n\n\u00a9 INETI 2009.

INTRODUCTION\n\nGeochronological studies and structural analyses of\ndifferent sectors of Ribeira Fold Belt (RFB) made in the\npast (CORDANI, 1971; CAMPOS NETO &amp; FIGUEIREDO,\n1995; MACHADO et al., 1996; HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO,\n2003; SCHMITT et al., 2004; ALKMIN et al., 2006)\nallowed a better understanding of the global evolution of\nthis orogenic belt from collision to late-exhumation\n\ntimes. However, main relationships between the thermo-\ntectonic evolution of this Western Gondwana belt and the\nimprinted structural features that usually characterize the\nBraziliano granulites and the regional size structure\ncentred in the Para\u00edba do Sul River valley are still to\nexplore. In this work, we will try to integrate and summa-\nrize the most recent petrological and thermochronologi-\ncal data (BENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008; BENTO DOS SANTOS\net al., 2007; 2008b; FONSECA et al., 2008, TASSINARI et\n\n\n\n102 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; P. E. FONSECA; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; C. DIAS NETO\n\nal., 2006) with the field work developed during the\n2004-2009 campaigns with the purpose of obtaining a\nnew multidisciplinary view of the thermotectonic/geody-\nnamic evolution of the central segment of the RFB, with\na main focus on the development of the tectonic frame-\nwork associated with the Al\u00e9m Para\u00edba \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio\nde P\u00e1dua megashear. \n\n2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\nThe studied S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua\n(SFSAP) sector, is located in the central-north RFB\n(CORDANI, 1971), northern Rio de Janeiro State, SE Brazil\n(Fig. 1). The RFB extends along the SE coast of Brazil,\nover 1,500 km from southern Bahia State to Uruguay,\nthrough Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais,\nS\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 States (CORDANI et al., 1973). This\nelongated belt is a NE-SW trending (south and central\nsectors) and NNE-SSW trending (northern sector)\nNeoproterozoic mobile belt (CORDANI et al., 1973) formed\nin the Braziliano-Panafrican Orogeny, as outcome of the\n\ncollision between the S\u00e3o Francisco and West Congo\ncratons (Fig. 2), from which resulted the southern part of\nWestern-Gondwana at around 670 \u2013 480 Ma ago\n(TROUW et al., 2000). Some authors (EBERT &amp; HASUI,\n1998; CAMPOS NETO, 2000) also envisage the involve-\nment of a third cratonic block (or shield), responsible for\nthe southern RFB structural features, that nowadays lies\nbeneath the Paran\u00e1 sedimentary basin. \n\nOne of the main features of this belt is that it consti-\ntutes a very complex orogenic zone composed of several\ngeological units separated by deep dextral shears (DIAS\nNETO et al., 2006). The SFSAP sector is located imme-\ndiately SE to one of this megashears, the Al\u00e9m Para\u00edba \u2013\nSanto Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua shear (APPS) (EGYDIO-SILVA et\nal., 2002), that strongly deformed the area rocks impo-\nsing a NE-SW trending dextral transpressive shear defor-\nmation associated with high grade metamorphism (Fig. 3). \n\nAccording to TROUW et al. (2000), RFB could be\ndivided in four major lithologic associations: a) reworked\nArchaean to Paleoproterozoic basement rocks composed\nof metavolcanic-sedimentary sequences, granodioritic\northogneisses and intermediate granulites (HEILBRON et\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location of the studied S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector (SFSAP) in the central-north Ribeira Fold Belt, northern Rio de Janeiro\nState, SE Brazil (Modified from HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO, 2003).

These\noccur as massive metamorphic charnockites, variable\n\n\n\n104 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; P. E. FONSECA; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; C. DIAS NETO\n\nsized patches and veins of incipient charnockites and as\nsin-/late intrusions of enderbites, commonly considered\nas massif-type igneous charnockites (TASSINARI et al.,\n2006). \n\nVarious tectonic, interpretative kinematics and\ngeodynamic models have been proposed for the\ntectonometamorphic evolution of the RFB (TASSINARI &amp;\nCAMPOS NETO, 1988; HEILBRON et al., 1993; CAMPOS\nNETO &amp; FIGUEIREDO, 1995; MACHADO et al., 1996;\nTROUW et al., 2000; CAMPOS NETO, 2000; SCHMITT,\n2001; HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO 2003) and other restricted\nareas (DIAS NETO et al., 2006). A dominant ensialic\nevolution with important crustal reworking has been\nfavoured (CORDANI, 1971; CORDANI et al., 1973),\nalthough subordinated oceanic crust subduction (and\nobduction) and continental accretion have also been\nconsidered (PEDROSA SOARES &amp; WIEDEMANN-LEONAR-\nDOS, 2000; PEDROSA SOARES et al., 2001). \n\nAccording to CAMPOS NETO &amp; FIGUEIREDO (1995)\nthe RFB includes distinct microplates, which were amal-\ngamated on Neoproterozoic and Eopaleozoic times,\nproducing the actual patchwork scenario. Within the\nSerra do Mar microplate, which includes the Costeiro\nComplex, the Rio Doce Orogeny was active from 590 Ma\nto 570 Ma, involving calc-alkaline arc magmatism,\nfollowed by collision (560 \u2013 530 Ma) of the microplate\nagainst the continent and post-collision magmatism\n(520 \u2013 480 Ma), characterized by the emplacement of\nalkali-calcic plutons and dikes. \n\nWithin the Rio de Janeiro State (central RFB), HEIL-\nBRON et al. (1993) and MACHADO et al. (1996) proposed\na tectonometamorphic evolution of the Braziliano Orogeny\ndivided in 3 stages: a collision period (590 \u2013 565 Ma) in\nwhich occurred the main deformation (D1 + D2) and the\nmain metamorphic period (M1) with reworking and\npartial melting of older continental basement rocks and\nemplacement of several granitoid bodies; followed by the\npost-collision period at 535 \u2013 520 Ma, corresponding to\nD3 and M2 retrograde metamorphism that developed in\nresponse to major dextral shear zones formation. It was\nthen followed by a post-tectonic period of orogenic\ncollapse with the emplacement of late granitic plutons. In\na later work, HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO (2003) divided the\ncentral part of the RFB in four tectonic domains (klippen\nthrusted against the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton) according to\ngeochronological data. These authors regarded the RFB\nas including, from NW to SE, a) the Occidental Domain,\na pre-1.8 Ga passive margin succession, considered as\nbeing the reworked margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton\n\n(basement); b) the Para\u00edba do Sul klippe, composed of\namphibolite facies orthogneisses and meta-sediments; c)\nthe Oriental Domain, comprising the Rio Negro\nMagmatic arc (TUPINAMB\u00c1, 1999) and fore-arc and\nback-arc meta-sedimentary sequences; and d) the Cabo\nFrio Terrane, an allochthonous terrane belonging to the\nWest Congo Craton. A younger orogenic event, the B\u0153zios\norogeny (SCHMITT, 2001), was defined in the Cabo Frio\nTerrane (TROUW et al., 2000) at 525 \u2013 520 Ma. The\nreferred authors suggest that the second collision (B\u0153zios\nOrogeny) exhumed the roots of the APPS producing the\nlate shearing with strong vertical dislocation. \n\nIn the northern part of the RFB, also named Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed\nBelt, a 625 \u2013 595 Ma calc-alkaline magmatic arc was\ndeveloped in a continental active margin; this was\nfollowed by a collision stage (595 \u2013 575 Ma) during\nwhich fragmented slices of oceanic crust (dated 800 Ma,\nminimum age for ocean-floor basalts) were obducted\nupon the sedimentary sequences. Long-term, intensive\ngranitic magmatism characterized late- to post-collision\ntimes, from 575 to 490 Ma (PEDROSA SOARES &amp; WIED-\nMANN-LEONARDOS, 2000; PEDROSA SOARES et al.,\n2001). These authors proposed that RFB would be the\nresult of the development of a complete Wilson Cycle\nin a confined environment, namely that the S\u00e3o Fran-\ncisco Craton was a paleo-peninsula of the larger Congo\nCraton and the north end of the RFB the product of a single\ncycle of metamorphism in gulf-deposited sediments.\n\nThe former articles, with large impact in the scien-\ntific community, led to the concept of a Braziliano\ncycle with several orogenic events in which the older\none, in Ribeira Fold Belt, correspond to the 630 \u2013 600 Ma\n\u201cRio Negro Orogeny\u201d (TUPIMAMB\u00c1, 1999), followed by\nthe 625 \u2013 575 Ma \u201cAra\u00e7ua\u00ed\u2019 Orogeny\u201d (PEDROSA SOARES\n&amp; WIEDMANN-LEONARDOS, 2000) and the 590 \u2013 570 Ma\n\u201cRio Doce Orogeny\u201d (CAMPOS NETO &amp; FIGUEIREDO,\n1995), and finally by the late ~ 520 Ma \u201cB\u0153zios orogeny\u201d\n(SCHMITT, 2001) in the Cabo Frio terrane. \n\nThis work brings a new conceptual model for the\nstudied area, resulting from an innovative approach of\nintegrating the structural data with geochronologi-\ncal/thermochronological data in central RFB. \n\n3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS \n\nThis study is concentrated in the near area SE to the\nAl\u00e9m Para\u00edba \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua megashear,\nwithin the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector\n(over 2500 Km2 wide) of the Ribeira Fold Belt. \n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 105\n\nFrom the structural/tectonic point of view, this area\nunderwent complex polyphase deformation shown by\nthree main tectonometamorphic phases that globally\ncorrespond to three main thermochronological periods\n(BENTO DOS SANTOS et al. 2007; BENTO DOS SANTOS,\n2008). The earliest deformation period (D1) corresponds\nto high grade thrusts (245-260\u00b0, 55-70\u00b0 NW) and\nstretching lineation (55-65\u00b0, 5-20\u00b0), that were mostly\nerased by the major and strongest deformation phase\n(D2) that corresponds to the Al\u00e9m Para\u00edba \u2013 Santo\nAnt\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua polyphasic thrust and shear system\n(APPS). The most impressive shear system in the region\n(D2) corresponds to a dextral transpressive megashear\nzone (50-65\u00b0, 70-85\u00b0 NW) with a sub-horizontal stretching\nlineation (5-20\u00b0, 230-235\u00b0). A dextral high grade conju-\ngated system (120-140\u00b0, 80-85\u00b0 SW)(D2b) related and\nsynchronous to D2 can commonly be observed. It is a\nNNE-NE thrusting system with stretching lineation\nprinted along the mylonitic foliations of 70\u00b0, 230\u00b0 that is\nimprinted (at diverse scales including satellite views) by\nthe structural/geomorphologic features drawn by the\nriver in the Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua \u2013 S\u00e3o Fidelis sector\n(Fig. 4). Finally a brittle tectonic event (corresponding to\nthe intrusion of the granitoids) D3, corresponds to the\nreactivation (opening and thermal relaxation) of the D2b\nshear system (290-320\u00b0, subvertical) (Fig. 5). Also\nubiquitously present in the studied area as part of the late\n\nbrittle regime, crosscutting all the previous structures, is\na metric scale sub-horizontal discontinuity (D3b) that\nrepresents the tardy-tectonic rebound of the exhumation-\n-caused tectonic collapse (CLIFT et al., 2004). \n\nThe stated field observations are compatible with a\nglobal structural framework of an asymmetrical flower\nstructure tilted to the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton but with a\nlarger (verging) SE branch, as the result of the collision\nbetween the two cratons (Fig. 6). \n\nAn important structural feature of the studied area is\nthat D1 + D2 deformation phases correspond to a dextral\ntranspressional regime developing in a non-homoge-\nneous tectonic system with characteristics of deforma-\ntion partition (TEYSSIER et al., 1995; TASSINARI et al.,\n2004), evidenced by the cartographic presence of\nsecondary discrete megashear corridors (Fig. 7) occurring\nparallel to the main APPS, separated by considerable\ndistances (5 to 10 km). \n\nIntense granulite facies metamorphism simultaneous\nwith D1 collision phase produced generalized migmati-\nzation and granitization by the partial melting of\nparagneisses. Outcrops in the area comprise the referred\nmigmatitic paragneisses (metatexites), interlayered with\nmarbles, calc-silicates and amphibolites; diatexitic\nmigmatites; massive and incipient-type charnockites\nassociated with their granitic to granodioritic orthogneiss\nprecursors and aplites; and blastomylonites that resulted\nfrom the relatively late deformation (D2) and retrogres-\nsion of the other major rock types in areas closer to the\nAPPS (Fig. 8 \u2013 11). The former lithologic units are com-\nmonly intruded by late undeformed granites and\npegmatitic veins associated with D3. \n\nMetatexites show a clear separation of gneissic paleo-\nsome and aplitic neosome. Gneissic banding is well\ndeveloped in these rocks, as well as clear evidence of late\ndeformation and retrogression. Diatexites comprise large\nelongated or rounded, undeformed and homogeneous\ngranular garnet-biotite-hornblende granitic to migmatitic\nbatholiths, derived by the partial melting of metatexites.\nIn the study area, charnockitic rocks range from ender-\nbites (basic charnockites) to charnockites (s. s.), occur-\nring in elongated NE-SW trending massifs. \n\nThe structural observations performed in the study\narea allow us to state that the amphibolitic facies retro-\ngression of this granulitic sector is intimately associated\nwith the large late dextral shearing that produced the\nblastomylonitic occurrences, as well as the major rock\nlineaments. However, this late deformation was not\nequally distributed, as metatexites present a penetrative\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Stereographic projection of stretching lineations mapped\nalong the mylonitic foliations of D2 APPS system showing\nrare high vertical ascension in the central parts of the flower\nstructure and dominant almost horizontal shearing in the late-\nral branches of the flower structure.

DIAS NETO\n\ntectonically controlled by the dextral D2b conjugated\nshears that are also discrete corridors, although with a\nsmaller strain rate than the main APPS. \n\nAlso seldom present in the study area is a sinistral\nantithetical regime near the strong and imposing dextral\nfaults that globally dominate and define the tectonic D2\ntranspressive regime. \n\nField observations and stereographic projections also\nsuggest that the studied area underwent strong deforma-\ntion partition that placed highly deformed rocks side by\nside to almost isotropic rocks (like the charnockite\nmassifs). Moreover, it is suggested that it was this long-\n-term transpressive regime, with associated deformation\n\npartition, that slowly exhumed the roots of this lower\ncrust segment (Fig. 13).\n\nSummarizing, the study area is characterized by a\nlong and strong megastructure \u2013 the APPS shear system\n\u2013 with a current low angle stretching lineation (10-15\u00b0)\nunderlined by the Para\u00edba do Sul River between Andrade\nPinto and Cambuci (Rio de Janeiro State). This megas-\ntructure is the central axis of a complex parallel shear\nsystem dominated by discrete structures in a globally\ntranspressional regime that deformed and retrograded the\nhigh grade granulitic rocks and exhumed the various\nlithologies at different rates (BENTO DOS SANTOS et al.,\n2007; BENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008). \n\nThe first collision pulse of the transpression is made\nby high velocity vertical movements (D1) at the apical\nzone, whereas the parallel \u201clateral sheets or lateral\nramps\u201d of the inferred asymmetrical flower structure\nhave lower dip angles, which makes its ascension\n(exhumation) to be much slower, as commonly observed\nin flower structures systems (Fig. 6). \n\nBecause the collision between the two cratons (S\u00e3o\nFrancisco and West Congo) is oblique and progressively\nmore tangential, a dramatically change in the exhumation\nrate between the centre of the structure and the lateral\nsheets occurs: while the movement is mainly collision,\nwith fast shortening by compression of the central part,\nexhumation of the central part is faster than in the periph-\nery, and when the main shortening process ends and\ntranspression becomes the main deformation process\n(SANDERSON &amp; MARCHINI, 1984), the main vertical\nascension changes to the lateral sheets, turning the\nexhumation rates from fast to slow in the central part and\ninversely in the lateral sheets (Fig. 14). \n\nFig. 13 \u2013 Stereographic projection with D1 high-temperature thrusts\nshowing clear dichotomy between the central part of the\nflower structure (almost vertical thrusting) and the lateral\nbranches that show almost horizontal imbrication-style\nshearing.

PETROGRAPHY\n\n4.1. Metatexites \n\nThe metatexites paleosome commonly comprises a g\n+ bi + pl + q + ksp + ru + mt \u00b1 ilm \u00b1 ap \u00b1 sill \u00b1 mu \u00b1 sp\n\n(Mineral abbreviations according to POWELL &amp; HOLLAND,\n1999) gneissic association, whereas the neosomatic frac-\ntion is a q + pl + ksp + g + bi \u00b1 sill \u00b1 ap aplite (Fig. 15). \n\nThe anastomosing granolepidoblastic texture largely\ndefined by the bi + q association is commonly obliterated\nby coarse grained, sometimes centimetric, sub-euhedral or\n\nFig. 15 \u2013 Metatexite petrography with generic mineral assemblages present in these rocks.\n\n\n\n112 T.

These megablasts frequently have matrix\nmineral inclusions, like biotite and opaque minerals, and\nare usually deformed, bent, cracked and with recrystali-\nzed rims, representing the metamorphic peak paragenesis\nof the metatexites, possibly with small amounts of quartz\nand residual biotite. Quartz is also abundant in garnet\nmicrocraks and in contact areas between megablasts.\nSymplectitic bi + q + sill growth after garnet is a\ncommon feature of these rocks. In some cases these\n\nmigmatites are intensively sheared, originating fine\ngrained mylonitic banding with abundant (sometimes\ncentimetric) sillimanite and/or muscovite. \n\n4.2. Diatexites \n\nHomogeneous, undeformed, medium grain sized\npl + q + ksp + bi + g + amph \u00b1 ap assemblage is typical,\nhaving rare ilmenite, muscovite and in one case small\namounts of orthopyroxene (Fig. 16). The texture is\n\nFig. 16 \u2013 Diatexite petrography with generic mineral assemblages present in these rocks.\n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 113\n\nfrequently dominated by biotite, imposing a granolepi-\ndoblastic texture to the rock or in some cases, granone-\nmatoblastic, when amphibole is dominant. Garnet is\ncommonly surrounded by biotite and amphibole, whether\nalong the rims or in small symplectites with quartz. \n\n4.3. Charnockites \n\nAccording to their paragenesis and occurrence they\ncan broadly be divided in three types: \n\na) isotropic charnockites (s. s.): medium to coarse\nsized granoblastic texture with megablastic (sometimes\n\ncentimetric) sub-euhedral pl + ksp (microcline) + g + opx\nis common. Q + bi + ilm + mt + ap + zrc are only present\nas diffuse, rarely orientated, matrix minerals. As in meta-\ntexites, megablasts commonly have a large amount of\nmineral inclusions, as well as, deformed and cracked\nrims. Bi + q symplectites are common around garnet and\npyroxene rims (Fig. 17); \n\nb) Margins of the charnockite massifs: charnockites\nwith fine grained mylonitic or cataclastic lepidoblastic\ntexture with bi + pl + ksp + q + opx (relict) + ap \u00b1 g \u00b1\namph mineral assemblage. Metamorphic peak mine-\nrals (pl + ksp + q + opx + g) are intensively deformed,\n\nFig. 17 \u2013 Petrography (with generic mineral assemblages) of isotropic charnockites.\n\n\n\n114 T. M.

DIAS NETO\n\nfractured, grinded, and replaced by an amphibolite facies\nassemblage of bi + amph + ilm (Fig. 18); \n\nc) Enderbites: banded, medium to coarse grained\nsub-euhedral pl + opx + cpx + g metamorphic peak para-\ngenesis, replaced by the amph + pl \u00b1 bi assemblage is a\ncommon feature of these basic charnockites. The large\namount of amphibole and small amount of biotite imprint\na granonematoblastic texture to this rock. Contrary to\ncharnockites (s. s.), enderbites show large quantity of\nclinopyroxene, probably due to its more calcic composi-\ntion. In fact, it is possible to observe amphibole inclu-\nsions in pyroxene and at the same time amphibole replac-\ning both orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene (Fig. 19). \n\n4.4. Blastomylonites\n\nMigmatites and charnockites are profusely retro-\ngressed and deformed in the near region of Santo\nAnt\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua, centre of the APPS. There, it is impos-\nsible to determine the rocks\u2019 sources, because of the blas-\ntomylonitic transformation they have experienced.\nTherefore, the global denomination of blastomylonite is\nemployed. In a petrographic point of view they are equi-\nvalent to their undeformed counterparts, with the excep-\ntion of having a profuse equigranular mylonitic texture\nwith abundant cracked, grinded and finely recrystalized\nmineral grains (Fig. 20). Mineralogical replacement of\nmetamorphic peak assemblage progresses in the same\n\nFig. 18 \u2013 Petrography (with generic mineral assemblages) of deformed and sheared charnockites.\n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 115\n\nFig. 19 \u2013 Petrography (with generic mineral assemblages) of coarse grained enderbites.\n\nway as previously stated, with the exception that in blas-\ntomylonites there are only remnants of the high grade\nparagenesis. \n\n5. ANALYTICAL METHODS \n\nSamples were prepared for the different types of\nanalyses at the Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias da Universidade\nde S\u00e3o Paulo and at the Departamento de Geologia da\nUniversidade de Lisboa. \n\nMineral composition data was determined on carbon\ncoated polished thin sections using a JEOL JXA 733\nwavelength dispersive Electron Microprobe, at the\nCentro de Geologia da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da\nUniversidade de Lisboa (CeGUL). Minerals were\nanalysed with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a\n\ncurrent of 10 nA, using a beam of 5 \u00b5m. Both natural and\nsynthetic silicates and oxides were used as standards. \n\n6. MINERAL CHEMISTRY SYNTHESIS \n\nExtensive mineral chemistry descriptions of these\nrocks are accessible elsewhere (BENTO DOS SANTOS,\n2008; BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2006; 2008a; MUNH\u00c1 et\nal., 2008). A brief portrayal of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo\nAnt\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector rocks, with main focus on blas-\ntomylonites, is presented in this chapter. Because blasto-\nmylonites are the result of late retrogression of the\nSFSAP sector granulites and are composed of different\nparageneses according to their protoliths, they commonly\nshow a great range of compositional values in the\nmineral chemistry results. \n\n\n\n116 T.

Feldspars\n\nAlthough anorthite contents in plagioclase (Xan) of\nall rock types rarely have a pronounced zoning from core\nto rim (maximum zoning is 0.1 for Xan, with cores\nhaving a general slightly lower anorthite content), diffe-\nrent samples of the same rock type from different places\nshow high scope of values, ranging from Xan = 0.29 to\n0.51 for charnockites (s. s.), from Xan = 0.30 to 0.47 for\nenderbites, Xan = 0.27 to 0.39 for metatexites, Xan = 0.35\nto 0.43 for diatexites and Xan = 0.35 to 0.50 for the inter-\nlayered amphibolites in metatexites. Blastomylonites\nshow the greatest range in anorthite content because of\nthe protholiths composition, ranging from Xan = 0.17 to\n0.55. K-feldspars are almost pure orthoclases, having a\nmaximum Xab of 0.13. \n\n6.2. Garnet \n\nAlmandine-rich phases are present in all rock types,\nwith Xalm always higher than 0.54, and always with\nMg-richer cores compared to the rims. Although, all rock\ntypes show the same zoning pattern from core (Mg-rich)\n\nto rim (Fe-rich), they all have different range of values,\nnamely Xalm = 0.66 to 0.75 and Xpy = 0.09 to 0.21 for\ncharnockites (s. s.), Xalm = 0.62 to 0.70 and Xpy = 0.11\nto 0.15 for enderbites, Xalm = 0.58 to 0.75 and Xpy= 0.17\nto 0.37 for metatexites, Xalm = 0.54 to 0.67 and Xpy =\n0.07 to 0.09 for diatexites and Xalm = 0.59 to 0.77 and\nXpy = 0.11 to 0.19 for blastomylonites, making the meta-\ntexites the richest in pyrope content and poorer in grossu-\nlar content (maximum Xgr of 0.05) whereas diatexites\nhave the richest grossular content (Xgr = 0.21 to 0.27).\nWhen compared with charnockites (s. s.), enderbites are\nnaturally richer in calcium having Xgr ranging from 0.15\nto 0.22, while their acidic counterparts range from 0.02\nto 0.18. Spessartite content is always low, reaching a top\ncontent of 0.13 in charnockites and diatexites, while\nenderbites and metatexites are always below 0.05. \n\n6.3. Pyroxenes \n\nIn charnockites, orthopyroxenes have enstatite\ncontents (Xen) that range from 0.39 to 0.48 with a maxi-\nmum 3% wollastonite content (Xwo) and Al2O3 contents\nranging from 0.76 to 3.40 Wt %. They are slightly zoned\n\nFig. 20 \u2013 Blastomylonite petrography with generic mineral assemblages present in these rocks: blastomylonitized migmatites (a-b); blastomylonitized\ncharnockites (c-d).\n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 117\n\nwith Mg-richer cores. Enderbites have similar core to rim\nzoning pattern and enstatite content ranging from 0.41 to\n0.44 and top 2 % wollastonite content, whereas the Al2O3\ncontent is lower, spanning from 0.59 to 0.98 Wt %. The\nonly blastomylonitic sample with orthopyroxene has\nidentical enstatite and Al2O3 contents as enderbites.\nAmphibolites included in the metatexites have higher\nenstatite values ranging from 0.51 to 0.52 and low Al2O3\ncontent, ranging from 0.76 to 0.95 Wt %. Clinopyro-\nxenes are commonly unzoned from core to rim, having a\nwollastonite content of 0.42 to 0.48 for all samples and\nenstatite contents of 0.30 to 0.35 for enderbites and blas-\ntomylonites, and 0.37 to 0.41 for amphibolites. \n\n6.4. Biotite \n\nEnderbites and diatexites have low-Mg biotites ranging\nfrom XMg = 0.42 to 0.43 and XMg = 0.36 to 0.38,\nrespectively, while charnockites and blastomylonites have\nlow to high-Mg biotites ranging from XMg = 0.39 to 0.55.\nTiO2 contents are relatively high for enderbites (TiO2 = \n= 5.7 \u2013 5.8 Wt %) and charnockites (TiO2 = 3.8 \u2013 6.3 Wt %),\nas expected for higher grade rocks, but also for blastomy-\nlonites (TiO2 = 4.9 \u2013 5.8 Wt %). Diatexites have smaller\nTiO2 values ranging from 3.7 to 4.5 Wt %. Metatexites\nand amphibolites have Fe-poor biotites; XMg values\nspan from 0.52 to 0.76 and 0.55 to 0.65, respectively.\nTheir TiO2 contents are also similar (3.7 \u2013 4.5 Wt %). \n\n6.5. Amphiboles \n\nAmphiboles are typically hornblendes with XMg\nvalues spanning from 0.35 to 0.54 in charnockites, ender-\nbites and diatexites, with enderbites having progressively\nMg-richer amphiboles. However, the amphibole TiO2\ncontents of diatexites is lower (TiO2 = 1.1 \u2013 1.5 Wt %) than\ngranulites (TiO2 = 1.8 \u2013 2.4 Wt %). Amphibolites have\nthe richest TiO2 and Mg contents in amphibole, ranging\nfrom TiO2 = 1.0 \u2013 3.0 Wt % and XMg = 0.54 \u2013 0.73. \n\n7. GEOTHERMOBAROMETRY\n\nA geothermobarometric study in the blastomylonitic\noccurrences was performed in order to constrain the\nmaximum metamorphic conditions for the beginning of\nthe APPS. Therefore, as described in the previous chapter,\n\ncore and rim major element analysis of each mineral was\nattained. \n\nTemperature estimates for the blastomylonitic occur-\nrences were determined using the g-bi Fe-Mg exchange\nthermometer of FERRY &amp; SPEAR (1978) corrected by\nHODGES &amp; SPEAR (1982), the g-cpx Fe-Mg exchange\nthermometer of ELLIS &amp; GREEN (1979), the g-amph Fe-Mg\nexchange thermometer of GRAHAM &amp; POWELL (1984),\nthe amph-pl Na-Ca exchange thermometer of HOLLAND\n&amp; BLUNDY (1994), the 2 pyroxenes thermometer and the\nol \u2013 cpx thermometer of ANDERSEN &amp; LINDSLEY (1988).\nPressures were determined using the GDISP barometer\nof ECKERT &amp; NEWTON (1991), the GASP barometer of\nNEWTON &amp; HASELTON (1981), the GRIPS and GRAIL\nbarometers of GHENT &amp; STOUT (1984) and the g-amph\nbarometer of KOHN &amp; SPEAR (1990). \n\nBlastomylonites show retrogressed maximum tem-\nperatures and pressures ranging from 785 to 615 \u00b0C and\n8.2 to 6.4 kbar. These temperature estimates are clearly\nwithin range of other existing results for the central RFB,\nsuch as BASCOU et al. (2002), KUHN et al. (2004), and\nSCHMITT et al. (2004). There are few works with pres-\nsure estimates for the central RFB, but these new results\nare higher than previously stated by other authors (REGO,\n1989; KUHN et al., 2004; NOGUEIRA et al., 2004). \n\nThese temperature and pressure estimates must be\nconsidered as minimum conditions for formation of these\nblastomylonites as they present highly retrogressed T and\nP, and obviously much lower conditions than the gra-\nnulitic protoliths from which they derived. Therefore, it\nis shown that the APPS associated deformation occurred\nat high-grade temperatures, which is compatible with field\nand geochronological data now presented. Core to rim\ncompositional zoning for blastomylonites show !T = \u2013150\nto \u2013250\u00b0 C and !P = \u20131.5 to \u20132.5 kbar (T ~ 500 \u00b0C and\nP ~ 5 kbar) after maximum metamorphic conditions, that\nare globally considered as resulting from the continuous\nchemical reequilibration caused by extensive long-term\nshearing. \n\n8. THERMOCHRONOLOGICAL DATA FOR\nTHE CENTRAL RIBEIRA FOLD BELT\n\nBecause thermochronological studies use the integra-\ntion of several geochronological systems with the respec-\ntive closure temperature of that isotopic system, they are\nextremely important in depicting how different rock\ntypes were cooled, and ultimately how the exhumation\n\n\n\n118 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; P. E. FONSECA; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; C. DIAS NETO\n\nprocess occurred, namely tectonic/geodynamic evolution\nfrom rock-forming temperatures to late-exhumation\ntimes. \n\nSeveral studies performed in the south, central and\nnorth zones of the Ribeira Fold Belt (DIAS NETO, 2001;\nBENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008; MUNH\u00c1 et al., 2005, respec-\ntively) have shown that after metamorphic peak condi-\ntions were reached at ~ 590 \u2013 565 Ma (TASSINARI et al.,\n2006), a long-term slow cooling regime was maintained\nuntil 520 \u2013 470 Ma (Fig. 21) when rocks began to cool\nrapidly by thrusting onto cooler basement or associated\nwith post-orogenic fault tectonics, probably related with\nthe initial stages of Paran\u00e1 basin-type sedimentary\ninfilling (BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007; 2008b). \n\n9. DISCUSSION \n\nPrevious works in other sectors of the Ribeira Fold\nBelt (MACHADO et al., 1996; SCHMITT, 2001; HEILBRON\n&amp; MACHADO, 2003) suggest a prior event to D1 that\ncorrespond to the earlier imbrication nappes thrust\nsystem. Along the studied area there are no structural\nevidence of this previous to D1 event (here called D0) but\nit was clearly registered by geochronological results\naround 630 \u2013 610 Ma (MACHADO et al., 1996; TASSINARI\net al., 2006; BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007). The\nreferred geochronological data points out the beginning\nof the earlier collision stages, between the Congo and\nS. Francisco cratons. \n\nThe structural field studies combined with the\nprevious thermochronological data suggest that D1\ndeformation phase is responsible for the early exhuma-\ntion of the majority of migmatites and blastomylonites,\nas well as some charnockites whereas the majority of\ncharnockites were maintained in high depths and are\nslowly exhumed along the lateral ramps of the branches\nof the collision asymmetrical flower structure. The\ntectonic imbrication, related with deformation partition,\nresults in a non-homogeneous exhumation: whereas in\nthe central axis of APPS the exhumation and ascension of\nthe blastomylonites is swift with a strong retrogression of\nthe lithologies, along the lateral branches the processes is\nmuch slower because of the small dip angle (5 to 10\u00b0) of\nthe thrusts associated with the oblique stretching along\nthese planes (30-45\u00b0 of obliquity). That geometrical\ncharacteristic produces only a high retrogression on the\ncharnockite borders whereas the \u201cboudin\u201d-like batholith\ncores remained virtually undeformed and with a\npreserved granulitic paragenesis. Another characteristic\nfeature of this tectonic exhumation style is the presence\nof the dextral lateral shears along very discrete shear\nthrusts with a notorious deformation partition \u2013 that\nincludes very deformed corridors separating blocks with\nalmost no within deformation, as can be seen in Pedreira\ndo Iterer\u00e9 where side-by-side rocks have a garnet \u2013 whole\nrock Sm-Nd ages with a 40 Ma age difference (BENTO\nDOS SANTOS et al., 2007; BENTO DOS SANTOS et al.,\n2008b), showing very disparate exhumation styles and\nrates (see Fig. 21). \n\nFig. 21 \u2013 Thermochronological evolution of the studied rocks (BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007a; BENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008). It is possible to\nobserve 2 different cooling paths between metatexites and blastomylonites (squares), that reach T &lt;650 \u00baC before 520 Ma and charnockites\nand associated aplites and orthogneisses (circles) that reach T &lt;650 \u00baC at 520 \u2013 470 Ma.\n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 119\n\nWithin this tectonic model, it is evident that the\nglobal evolution of the APPS system (during D1 and D2\nevent) from early-collision to late-exhumation times\ninfluenced the rates of exhumation in the different zones\nof the APPS system, as well as the lithologic associations\nformed during this orogeny. Therefore, it is not strange to\nfind the main blastomylonitic occurrences in the central\npart of the APPS and the isotropic (or less deformed)\ncharnockites (inferred as the last to drop from the high\ntemperature conditions; BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007)\nin the lateral part of the flower structure (Fig. 22). \n\nA multiscale repeated geometry from microscale to\nmegascale/mapping low scale dimension was observed\nin the studied area. An example of this peculiar geome-\ntric pattern can be observed in the repeated changes of\nthe structural features near the rigid bodies (i.e. sigmoid\nbiotite shape near garnets on the petrographic scale, or\nmetatexites non-asymmetrical kinematics body with\ndextral shear criteria attitudes in the vicinities of\ncharnockite \u201cboudin\u201d-like bodies on the regional scale). \n\nThe new structural and thermobarometric data\nobtained suggests that the APPS activity began at an\n\nearly stage in the global tectonic evolution of Ribeira\nFold Belt. Because blastomylonites (the deformed and\nhighly retrograded granulite counterparts) show esti-\nmated mineral temperatures of almost 800\u00b0 C (HOLLAND\n&amp; BLUNDY, 1994), it must be assumed that these rocks\nwere retrogressed by D2 deformation phase (APPS\nmegashear corridors) when this crustal segment still\npresented very high temperatures. PORCHER et al. (1995)\nand BASCOU et al. (2002) also obtained very high\ntemperatures for these blastomylonites in the near areas\nof Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua. These results are compatible\nwith previous works developed by MACHADO et al.\n(1996) that suggest that APPS megashear may have\nbegun around 600 to 550 Ma ago and BENTO DOS\nSANTOS et al. (2007) that constrained that initial activity\nat around 575 to 550 Ma. \n\nThe APPS megastructure was responsible in an early\nstage for the exhumation of deep rocks by a system of\nearlier thrusts, corresponding to a mainly collision stage\nthat probably generated a symmetrical flower structure\nfrom which there are no evidence nowadays. These\nearlier deformation stages and thrust system evidence\n\nFig. 22 \u2013 Tectonic implications on the exhumation styles of different parts of the APPS and consequent deformation/preservation of the different rocks with\nblastomylonite occurrence in the central part of the shear system and charnockite occurrence in the lateral branches of the flower structure.\n\n\n\n120 T.

DIAS NETO\n\nwere nearly totally obliterated by the dextral main shear\nsystem where deformation partition was concentrated at\ndiscrete almost vertical surfaces. Inside the almost\npreserved blocks, between those discrete surfaces, it is\npossible to observe some antithetical sinistral kinematics\nin a globally dextral regime. This phenomenon occurs\nwhere the deformation partition is so intense that the\nrheological behaviour of a material in the vicinities of a\nstrong dextral shear corridor is forced to have the oppo-\nsite kinematics (CARRERAS, 2001) (Fig. 23). This is also\nsuggested for the escape tectonics proposed by VAUCHEZ\net al. (1992) and EGYDIO-SILVA et al. (2002) for the\nsouth and south-central RFB that probably caused the\nantithetic shears observed by DIAS NETO et al. (2006) in\nthe S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o \u2013 Ilha Bela region. \n\nThe previously referred thermochronological data\n(DIAS NETO, 2001; BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007) and\nthe structural observations for the D2 deformation phase\nsupports the existence of very long-term transpressive\ndextral regime for the APPS activity that may have lasted\nfrom metamorphic peak ages (about 575 Ma) to late\nexhumation of some charnockites (about 490 Ma) when\nD3 thermal collapse granite emplacement and a global\nthermal relaxation with layer-type opening of D3b\ndiscontinuities occurred.\n\nThe structural framework present in the SE Brazilian\nRibeira Fold Belt underlines an oblique collision\nbetween two Paleoproterozoic cratons (being the present\ngeographic coordinates of S\u00e3o Francisco at NW and West\nCongo at SE) and their suture corresponding to the main\ntranspressive shear corridor in the area \u2013 APPS. This\n\ncollision scar is also marked by the Dom Silv\u00e9rio Group\n800 Ma ophiolitic remnants (PEDROSA SOARES et al.,\n2001) that represent a post-1 Ga (TROMPETTE, 2002)\noceanization period to the north. Although, the presence\nof these oceanic slivers would be more probable to the\nSW (our study area), because of the larger space between\nthe two cratons prior to the collision, these ophiolitic\nslices do not outcrop, probably because of the much\nstronger deformation imposed by the paleotopographic\ncoast lines that induced a closer proximity and the\nrespective larger strain rate. \n\n10. CONCLUSIONS \n\nAlthough in the study area there is no structural\nevidence for the D0 thrust nappe system, geochronologi-\ncally it is inferred by the oldest 630 to 610 Ma ages\npreviously obtained, considered as belonging to the\ninitial stages of continental collision. A > 35 Ma period\nof orthogonal shortening between the two cratons\noccurred until ~ 575 \u2013 565 Ma when metamorphic peak\nconditions were reached, simultaneously with the deve-\nlopment of the D1 flower thrust system. When orthogo-\nnal shortening turned rheologically problematic, because\nrocks could not absorb further shortening, D2 dextral\ntranspressive regime became the main deformation phase\nsoon after the granulitic metamorphic peak at T ~ 800\u00b0 C.\nThis dextral cinematic change associated with the original\nS\u00e3o Francisco and West Congo cratons shapes produced\nan asymmetric flower structure with a more developed\n\nFig. 23 \u2013 Special antithetical sinistral kinematics in a globally dextral regime caused by differential deformation rates.\n\n\n\nGeodynamic evolution of the S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector, central Ribeira Fold Belt, SE Brazil 121\n\nSE branch. The SE branch shows triclinic fabric features\n(DIAS NETO et al., 2006) with a strong oblique stretching\nlineation that was responsible for a very slow exhuma-\ntion in the lateral branches of this flower structure that\nmay have lasted for 80 to 100 Ma. When the long-term\ntranspressive exhumation associated with gravitatio-\nnal/erosional collapse of the orogen (progressive thin-\nning of the lithosphere) ceased, D3 relaxation opening\nwith granitoid/pegmatitic emplacement occurred. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nFAPESP, POCA-PETROLOG (CEGUL, UI: 263;\nPOCTI/FEDER) and GEODYN (POCTI \u2013 ISFL \u2013 5 \u2013 32)\nand a PhD scholarship from FCT (SFRH/BD/17014/2004)\nco-financed by FEDER provided support for field and\nanalytical work.
